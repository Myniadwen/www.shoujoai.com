<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I awoke slowly,  swallowing a bad taste in my throat. The room was a little hotter  than I remember it being before I fell asleep but when I kicked the  covers off of me I suddenly felt cold. The room swam above me when I  opened my eyes, making me want to curl in a ball to try and hug  myself. As pleasing at that would be at the moment, I found my limbs  not wanting to respond to my commands. My stomach churned and I  realized why I had woken up so suddenly. Forcing myself to roll over,  I grabbed a pillow and held it close while repeating to myself that I  was not going to throw up. Unfortunately my body won the battle  against my mind and I could feel my body prepare for it. ‘<em>Great…</em>’</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka stumbled out of  bed and almost fell on top of Nagisa as she tried to make it out of  her room with her hand over her mouth. “Honoka?” She heard her  name being called lightly but she still continued along her way. The  cold outside did nothing to make her feel better and her stomach told  her that if she didn’t get out of it soon, it would make it clear  that it was upset with her at the moment. As she reached the bathroom  she felt herself fall down next to her bathtub and lean against it  while panting. “ Honoka?” The voice repeated itself as Nagisa  peeked, actually turning on the lights since the first one in forgot  to do so. “Hey, you okay?” She knelt beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seeing Honoka shake her  head, Nagisa sighed and scooped up her friend’s hair into a sloppy  ponytail and held it as she got sick. The blond turned her head and  made a grossed out expression. “Bleh. Reminds me of that one single  time I was talked into drinking beer. Though at least then you didn’t  have to hold my hair up…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka fell backwards  against the wall and panted heavily. “Wha…..water please…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing,”  Nagisa reached up to the sink and filled a cup for her before helping  the girl to stand. “One glass of water,” she handed it to her and  sighed. “Poor thing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh wow I feel  better.” Honoka giggled as best she could. “Thank you darling;  I’ll owe you one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mention it…”  She scooped the girl up in her arms and smiled when no complaint was  given. “Ready to get in bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very much so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here we go then,”  Turning the corner; she made her way back across the house and into  the Honoka’s bedroom. “You going to be okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” Honoka  nodded sleepily and soon felt the bed sink down next to her once she  was placed. Fingers gently ran through her hair as she lay on the  pillow, making her sensed dull. “That feels nice…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t it? I love  it when you do it to me.” She got a small murmur in response,  making the girl give a light grin. “Hush little Honoka, don’t say  a word. Nagi’s gonna buy you a mocking bird. And if that mocking  bird don’t sing… Nagi’s gonna buy you a diamond ring…” She  continued the soft song for a little longer before Honoka’s  breathing settled down and was already sleeping again. Very slowly  she stood from the bed and tucked the girl in before falling onto her  futon on the floor and trying to regain some sleep herself.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Good morning,”  Nagisa greeted her friend as she very carefully sat up in bed. “Or  afternoon, whichever you prefer.” She put down her manga and sat on  the bed by her. “How do you feel?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,”  Honoka rubbed her eyes softly. “What time is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little after noon.  Do you want anything to eat?” The blond went about fixing the other  girl’s hair, pulling it a ponytail to keep it off her neck.  “Waffles maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Water?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa stood and gently  pet the girl on the head. “Coming right up.” She made her way to  the kitchen and began to prepare her friends brunch, a little  surprised to find the girl following her. “Should you be walking  around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want you  to burn my house down,” She replied with a voice that still seemed  a little dazed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can make waffles  just fine,” Nagisa informed her, making the girl sit in a chair.  “Just you watch.” And watch she did. Honoka saw her friend take  out some frozen waffles from a box and pop them in a toaster before  getting her a glass of water and soon returning to her with breakfast  ready. “See? Piece of cake.” Honoka giggled before cutting some  of it and slowly nibbling. “Say,” the blond slid her arms down  the table and rested her head on them. “When you get better, what  do you want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Make out,” Honoka  told around her food. “While snuggling in front of the fireplace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With hot coco?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And marshmallows.  The little ones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa gave her an  amused look and watched her finish half of her meal before slowing  down and starting to stare into space. “Starting to get to you  again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… I’d like it a  lot if you could carry me to bed? I don’t think I can stand…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sandy blond  carefully lifted her lover from the chair and carried her, a little  sad at feeling her friend’s head fall lazily against her chest.  “You’ll be good as new in a day or two, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” The girl  mumbled, already starting to doze off again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t sleep just  yet; you need to take some medicine.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa held the phone  to her ear with her shoulder as she carefully cut up a carrot into  small pieces. “Okay, I have that done,” She spoke into the  receiver absently. “What now…? Okay… Lemme check.” She walked  to the pot and stirred the meat around in it. “Yeah, they’re  brown all the way around, do I add the other stuff in now?... Hikari,  please stop laughing.” She sighed as her friend had a complete  giggle fit on the other side of the line. “Yes, I fail at cooking,  I know that.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,”  Hikari gasped between laughing. “It’s just so funny! You help me  with everything imaginable, but you call me when you need to cook  something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s for  Honoka…” Nagisa told her lightly. “I can’t mess up; I’d  feel really, really bad if she got worse because of my cooking…”  Honoka brought a hand up to cover her smile, leaning against the wall  leading into the kitchen. Although she couldn’t be seen there, she  could hear just fine and was keeping tabs on Nagisa’s hectic  attempt to make her dinner. “No, I didn’t put too much salt in.”  Nagisa’s voice came up again as she walked around. “I promise.  Now what do I do…?” There was a small pause.  “Hikariiiiiii you  can’t leave me now! I need you! Tell Akane-san that you’ll do it  later? But….<em>But</em>… All right, I understand. Yeah. Okay  tomorrow it is. Bye bye.” The phone clicked off and she put it on  the counter. “I can’t believe this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Deciding that now would  be a good part to stop eavesdropping on her friend, Honoka walked  back to her room where she proceeded to fall onto the bed and cover  herself up to get another few hours of sleep in before dinner.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Did I wake you?”  Nagisa asked as she slid open the door to the bedroom. She used her  foot to close it back since her hands were pre-occupied carrying a  tray of food.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh, I woke up a  few minutes ago.” Honoka pulled herself up and sat Indian style.  “What you have there?” She already knew the answer but asked  anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stew,” Nagisa sat  the tray on a nightstand and smiled. “But first, I need your  temperature. Open for me,” She picked up the thermometer and held  it out. “Under your tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, mother,”  Honoka nipped the device with her mouth and then moved it into place.  “How was cooking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t talk till  it’s done,” Nagisa grinned at the look she received. “But it  was okay. I can do things if I try hard enough.” She got a hum from  the girl as she sat the try on Honoka’s lap and put a few crackers  for her. Once she was settled, she sat her own food on the desk  before retrieving the small glass device from her friend’s lips.  “Let’s see….101.3; Not really sure how far you are along  running this thing out, but it’s better than your first one so I  guess that’s a good sign. Are you feeling any better? Can you eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka smiled to  herself at being pampered so much. “Yes, I think I can eat. And I’m  feeling about the same I think.” She had given up on lying to her  friend after the first hundred times she was asked how she was  feeling. As she looked into her soup she wondered on just what  exactly it would taste like. Nagisa was great at presenting a meal,  but the taste more often than not totally disagreed with how it  looked. The worse the meal looked normally meant the better it would  taste and vice-versa.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not poisoned…  I think.” Nagisa spoke uneasily, looking into her own bowl. “I  tasted it as I went but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sick girl picked up  her spoon and stirred it in her bowl before bringing it to her mouth  and softly blowing on it. Nagisa held her breath as she watched,  unconsciously bringing a hand up to bite her nails. Normally Honoka  would smack her hand when she did it but thankfully this time she  wasn’t paying attention, or could reach her if she wanted to.  “How  is it…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s very yummy,”  Honoka got another spoonful after biting into a cracker. “You did a  great job.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh thank god…”  Nagisa let out her breath and turned to her own dinner, eating it a  little faster than her roommate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When her steaming bowl  started to cool down a little more, Honoka realized just how hungry  she was. She drained the first helping and almost the rest of  another. Nagisa was happy to see her friend eat again since the first  day the girl barely downed much of anything. “I’m so full…”  Honoka fell back, resting against the headboard of her bed. “That  was wonderful, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad you liked  it,” Nagisa took her tray and sat it on the desk before sitting  next to her. “Do you want to lie back down?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh, I’m sick of  being in bed. I want to do something else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Movie? Game?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka looked at the  discarded backpacks and grinned. “How about homework?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa literally felt  herself almost fall over. “Homework… It’s the day after  vacation starts and you want to do homework…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yup!” She closed  her eyes and smiled at her. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll never  understand you… Ever.” Despite her words, Nagisa still scooped  the girl up and carried her to the table in the room before sitting  her down. Next she draped a light throw cover over her shoulders and  then proceeded to get the backpacks. “What subject?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Science.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should I even have  asked?” Nagisa tossed them on the table and sat herself down as  well. “Okaaaaay… We need to outline two chapters and answer the  questions at the end.” She opened her book and instantly flipped to  the end of the chapter. “Right then,” A hand covered the  questions, making her blink and look up at Honoka.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not going to  let you read the questions and then just skim for the answers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… You never let me  have any fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your grades also  went from D’s and F’s to C’s and B’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t mean I  like it…” Nagisa pouted at her. “Come on, its Christmas  vacation!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No means no,”  Honoka smiled happily. “Lets answer them together; it’ll be more  fun that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Letting out a sigh,  Nagisa reluctantly agreed. “Fine, fine.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Honoka looked up at the  ceiling of her room and sighed out loudly. “What’s wrong?”  Nagisa asked her idly while reading a random yaoi manga.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to be  sick…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re already  sick,” She replied absently as she turned the page.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I mean I’m going  to throw up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again!?” Nagisa  quickly hopped up and over to her, helping the shaking girl get to  her feet. “Going to make it?” After seeing her shake her head,  Nagisa lifted her up and trotted to the bathroom where Honoka  proceeded to lose everything she had managed to eat earlier in the  day. “Take it easy honey…” Nagisa gently rubbed her back in a  small circle. “You’ll be okay…” She waited till her friend  nodded weakly before getting her a cloth to wipe her mouth with and a  glass of water. “Wow you hurl like a champ,” She teased her to  lighten the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remind me to hit you  later…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not a chance,”  Nagisa sat down behind the girl and wrapped her arms lightly around  her, pulling Honoka back to lean against her front. “Just relax a  moment before we move you again okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay…” Honoka  weakly rested against her, sliding down so her head was nestled  against Nagisa’s shoulder and neck. “Sorry I’m such a pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not a  pain,” Nagisa gave her a gentle squeeze. “A little flu virus  isn’t going to make me love you any less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure I don’t  look like a good lover right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well besides bed  hair, bad breath, the smeared makeup we never took off, puffy eyes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I still love you,”  Nagisa kissed the top of her head. “You’re still pretty, even  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You spoil me…As  much as I want to go along with this conversation; I think I’m  going to lose it again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa shifted her and  rubbed her back again as the girl started to cough. “There-there,  honey…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Rolling over, Nagisa  squinter her eyes to try and block out the sun shining down on her.  After a few moments the girl let out an exasperated sigh and admitted  defeat. She pulled herself up to a sitting position and looked around  the room, seeing Honoka already awake and reading some random book.  “Good morning,” She yawned. “How do you feel on day three?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Slimy,” Honoka  replied with a light lop-sided smile. “I want to take a bath but  didn’t want to wake you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about  me,” Nagisa stumbled to her feet and stretched out. “What time is  it?”  She leaned herself backwards and popped her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About eleven,”  Honoka gave her a disapproving look. “I’ve told you countless  times you’re going to hurt yourself if you don’t stop that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” She said  it even thought she obviously didn’t really seem to think about it.  “Hikari is going to come over around lunch time so let’s get a  bath now before she gets here.” Nagisa got out a pair of cloths for  herself before raiding Honoka’s closet and picking out some loose  fitting sweatpants and a baggy shirt. After tossing them over her  shoulder she walked over to the bed and once again lifted her lover  up into her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, what is it with  you and carrying me all of a sudden?” Honoka looked up at her. “I  don’t think I’ve taken twenty steps in the past three days. I’m  going to forget how to walk before I get any better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’ll carry  you everywhere,” Nagisa promised, winking. “Although if I bash  your head into a doorframe or something, you’ll have to forgive  me.” The words made Honoka curl up on her and look at the doors  they passed through with a skeptical eye. When they reached the  bathroom Nagisa sat her friend on her feet and proceeded to turn on  the bathwater. “How hot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice and warm, a  fever is the body’s way of fighting off infection. As long as  you’re comfortable it doesn’t really matter…Why are you  grinning like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the first  time you’ve ranted about a topic since you got sick, I’m kind of  happy to see you going back to normal. Ack, speaking of going back to  normal I didn’t take your temperature this morning!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“100.7,” Honoka  informed her as she started to take off her cloths. “I just wish I  felt as much better as my fever would imply…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t think about  it or you’ll start to feel worse,” Nagisa tossed he own cloths to  a small pile before guiding the now nude Honoka to the shower  showering section of the bathroom. She had always been jealous of  Honoka’s house ever since she saw the bath. Although their  apartment had a shower in it, Honoka had a traditional Japanese  bathroom with a section to shower in and then a huge bathtub meant  for soaking. “Here, sit down.” She moved a stool for her. “I’ll  wash your hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do spoil me…”  Honoka did as she was asked and was rewarded with a warm stream of  water over her head. When her hair was wet soft fingertips started to  massage in the shampoo for her, making the girl almost want to fall  asleep right then and there. “Mmmmm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like that?” Nagisa  got a small nod. “Good.” The hair washing turned into a sponge  bath, much to the delight of the sick girl and the torture for the  one doing it. The soft moans of pleasure from having her back rubbed  to the intakes of breath when her front was rubbed, each one started  to work its way into the sandy-blonde’s mind. “Finished,” she  spoke finally. “Lets get you rinsed and into the bathtub before I  lose my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Honoka  looked a little sad. “When I’m better, I promise…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no,” Nagisa  took her hand and walked with her to the bathtub. “Don’t be  silly. I’m enjoying just being with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If it makes you feel  any better, the thought crossed my mind too.” She looked down at  her friend’s body a moment before turning away and slipping into  the bathtub. “But I don’t think you want to get me all worked up  and have me throw up on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bleh, talk about a  mood killer.” Nagisa went back to the showerhead and started to  clean herself while her sick friend relaxed. “Remember that time  Hikari walked in on us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t remind me,”  Honoka sank deeper in the water. “She couldn’t look me in the eye  for a week… I think we scarred the poor girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t like we  were doing anything really bad…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were screaming  my name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was <em>not</em>!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hikari peeked into the  bedroom slowly and slid in herself when she saw Nagisa motion her in.  Taking off her shoes, she sat them outside and closed the door  softly. “She asleep?” Her voice whispered out, getting a nod in  return. “Any better?” Hikari looked down at the sleeping girl  before sitting by Nagisa and shivering.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little,” The  girl adjusted the heater so it was closer to her friend. “Her fever  went down and she hasn’t thrown up yet today but she’s still only  awake for an hour or two at a time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohhh…” Hikari  looked at the bed a little sad. “Poor thing; right at the start of  vacation…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you?  Aren’t you working already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Akane said I could  take any day off I wanted since it was break time for me. Honestly,  it’s a lot more fun to be at work, I get terribly bored at home.”  Hikari’s thoughts were interrupted by a slight sneeze. “Brrr…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa put an arm  around the girl and rubbed her shoulder. “You’ll get used to it  after a while. I wish Honoka would have let me take her to my place  till she was better since I have central heating, but she would have  none of it.” Hikari giggled softly to herself, making some snow  fall from her hair. “Hey… is it snowing out there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, didn’t you  know? It’s been snowing for over an hour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kya!” Nagisa held  back her gasp and crawled over to the door, peeking out. “It <em>is</em>!  Come on Hikari, lets play!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, come on,”  She pulled the younger girl to her feet. “If we stay in here  talking we’ll just wake her up.” Nagisa smiled brightly at her,  getting a small grin in return.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes I wonder  which one of us is the oldest.” She followed her friend outside and  laughed as Nagisa ran out in the yard with her arms held out wide.  “Nagisa, you’re such a dork.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”  She pouted  at her. “At least I have a girlfriend.” Reaching down, she  scooped up some snow and packed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who wants one?”  Hikari also got a few handfuls of the white powder and eyes her  friend’s snowball.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t pull that  one me!” Nagisa threw the ball, smacking her in the chest. “I’ve  seen the way you look at your friend Nao!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Hikari  reared back and threw her own weapon, missing horribly. “Don’t  say stuff like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both girls went to pick  up more snow before circling each other. “In the closet, eh? It’s  okay, I understand!” She dodged another snowball and threw her own,  once again hitting the target.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not in the  closet!” Hikari quickly threw another sloppily made snowball,  blushing horribly. “Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Knock, knock!”  Nagisa teased, once again using her lacrosse training to land a  direct hit. “Open up Hikari, let me in, it’s Nao!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like her!”  Hikari ran forward and pounced her friend. “Don’t say that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari’s got a  crush! Hikari’s got a crush!” The two rolled around in the snow a  moment before Nagisa pinned her. “How long have you liked her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like  girls!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Suuuuuuuuuuuure!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou! Get off!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not until you admit  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa!” Hikari  wanted very much so to cover her blushing cheeks but found them still  held down. “Please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, it’s just  me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“….” Hikari  looked to the side. “I… don’t know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not sure?”  Nagisa blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um… How did you…  you know?” she looked up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Oh! How did I  realize I liked Honoka?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. I  just did.” Nagisa grinned. “So you’re not in the closet, you’re  just thinking about opening the door.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t say that!”  Hikari felt herself be unpinned when Nagisa had to hold her sides  laughing. “Why you…” She pushed the girl over and pinned her  this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like you can hold me  down,” Nagisa lifted her arms up, pushing the weaker girl’s hands  in the process.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who said I wanted  to?” She gave her the best evil look she could muster before  quickly grabbing the neck of Nagisa’s shirt with one hand and using  her other to shovel snow into it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahhh! Cold! COLD!”  Nagisa rolled over as she was freed and quickly shook the snow out.  “You little brat, come here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way!” Hikari  ran away from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not getting  away!” Nagisa quickly caught up and grabbed her, tossing the girl  over her shoulder and carried her back to the front of Honoka’s  room as her hostage laughed out, begging to be sat down. When they  reached her destination Nagisa carefully sat her friend down before  falling next to her and leaning against a support beam. “If you’re  confused,” She began after a moment. “You can talk to us anytime  you want. I won’t tease you for real.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Thanks.”  Hikari scooted a little closer to her for warmth. “You and Honoka  make a good couple. I’ve been envious for a while now, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t we, though?”  Nagisa smiled happily as she looked out in the snow. “It’s too  bad she’s sick. I wanted to be alone with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you are alone  with her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa grinned. “No,  I mean <em>alone </em>with her.” She winked. “In front of the fire  place, if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh gross!” Hikari  closer her eyes. “I don’t need to hear about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa sang a little  song playfully. “I’m gonna make love to you womaaaaaan! Gonna lay  you down by the fire!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god, mental  image!” Hikari shook her head quickly to try and rid herself of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lighten up, you know  how much we love each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I don’t need  to <em>know</em> what you two do. You’re my best friends, that’s  disgusting!” Hikari eyed her. “I bet you’re the man of the  group too, you tomboy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that!?”  Nagisa glared at her and get a tongue stuck out at her in return.  “Just for that, I’m going to let you in on a little secret.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” Hikari  blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know last time  Honoka and I stayed at your house for the night?” She got a small  nod and Nagisa gave her a big grin. “And you went to sleep during  the late night movie?” She got another nod, to which she leaned in  closer and smiled larger. Hikari blinked again before realizing what  she meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You had sex in my <em>room</em>!?” Hikari gasped out, shocked. “With me <em>in it,  asleep!?</em>” She watched Nagisa’s smile get even bigger. “On  my <em>bed</em>!!!” She suddenly went into shock, giving a look as if  her dog had just been shot. “Oh my god I slept on those sheets  before I washed them! Ew! Ew! Ew!” She hit Nagisa’s shoulder each  time she said the word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had to bite your  pillow to keep from waking you!” The sandy-blond continued as she  was hit more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you two  lively today?” Honoka asked as she stepped out of her room with a  blanket wrapped around her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka! Make Nagisa  stop!” Hikari hugged the girl when she sat down and hid herself  under the blanket along with her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, stop teasing  Hikari.” Honoka wrapped the covers around her and let Hikari sit in  her lap while hugging her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not doing  anything,” Nagisa said evasively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s telling me  all sorts of gross things you two have done!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, don’t tell  Hikari about our private lives,” Honoka told her gently while  Hikari gave Nagisa a look that clearly read ‘Ha ha, you’re  getting scolded!’ and then smiled in triumph. “I’m positive  Hikari doesn’t want to know all the wonderful things you can do  with your tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh <em>gross!</em>”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How do you feel?”  Nagisa asked softly after tucking Hikari into the futon. They had  played outside for most of the day while Honoka watched them from her  room while reading.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not bad,” Honoka  allowed Nagisa to sit on the bed with her and nuzzled up under her  arm. “Didn’t feel like getting sick all day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t eat  much of anything all day,” Nagisa counted in a whisper, gently  kissing the girl’s temple. “Let me take your temperature.” She  got a small nod and soon she took the thermometer from Nagisa’s  hand with her mouth, giving her a cute puppy-dog look as it did its  thing. Giggling, Nagisa waited for the beep and plucked the device  back, looking at it. “100.1, getting better slowly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” Honoka  yawned softly. “I’m so sick of being in bed, but I’m so tired…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The medication is  supposed to make you sleepy, so I guess you’ll just have to deal  with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I feel bad.  You’ve been here for three nights now and I haven’t spent more  than twelve hours with you total... and even then, a few of them was  me holding you while trying not to lose my mind in the stupid fever  dreams.”  Honoka looked up at her girlfriend a little sadly. “I  wanted to spend our vacation doing more fun things… I’m really  sorry I ruined it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka,” Nagisa  said her name a little firmly. “I like just being here. I hate that  you’re sick, but because of it mom let me stay here for so long.  I’m happy to take care of you so please don’t feel bad.” She  brought her free hand to her mouth and kissed a finger before  offering it to her girlfriend, who touched her finger to it and then  kissed her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Honoka  wrapped her arms around the girl and snuggled up against her. “Hey,  Nagisa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you too,  silly girl.” Nagisa giggled to herself.</span></p>
