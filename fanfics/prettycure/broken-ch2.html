<h1>Broken (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../prettycure/index.html">Pretty Cure</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/satashi.html">Satashi</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../prettycure/broken-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Humming to myself, I arranged the box lunch neatly for my friend. 
Currently Nagisa was still asleep and snoring quite loudly. Of course 
normally I would still be in bed as well, but today I had to prepare two 
lunches. When I was finally satisfied with the meals I took a bottle of 
food coloring and dabbed some into the rice, turning it a nice pink color. 
The finishing touch was a cute heart shaped design in the box of rice. 
Nagisa could probably eat more than me and my science club put together 
so I made plenty extra just for her. Wrapping them up, I took off my 
apron and walked back to my bedroom, stopping a moment to answer the 
phone as it rang.



&quot;Yukishiro residence,&quot; Honoka greeted the person calling. &quot;Honoka 
speaking.&quot; The girl walked to her room and opened the door, smiling at the 
girl who was just waking up. &quot;Oh, Miss Misumi! ...Yes mam, Nagisa is 
here.&quot; She looked over at her friend, who was shaking her head and waving 
her arms. &quot;Ah, I&#39;m sorry she&#39;s in the bath right now. Can I give her a 
message?&quot; Honoka sat down and playfully pushed her friend out of the 
way when she tried to put her ear up to the phone. &quot;I can tell her that, 
but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll do any good.&quot; The blue haired girl finally 
pushed her friend back on the bed and sat on her stomach to keep the girl 
from knocking the phone from her hands. &quot;I think if I told Nagisa to go 
home she would leave here but probably stay at another friend&#39;s house. 
I&#39;d much rather have her where I can take care of her... Yes mam... 
Okay, will do... No problem. Bye bye.&quot; 

&quot;What did she say?&quot; Nagisa asked, looking up at the girl sitting on 
her. 

&quot;She wants you to come home, and they&#39;re sorry for upsetting you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go home.&quot;

Honoka slid down next to her friend. &quot;You have to go home sooner or 
later.&quot; Reaching up, she poked Nagisa&#39;s nose. &quot;One little argument won&#39;t 
stop Cure Black will it?&quot;

&quot;Well that one we had a while back sure put a stop to me.&quot; Nagisa 
rolled over and pinned her friend on the bed. 

Honoka grinned and rolled over, counter-pinning her friend. &quot;What was 
that about anyway? I just remember being mad for some reason.&quot;

Nagisa once again rolled over, this time dumping them both into the 
floor with a soft thud sound. &quot;Ow. I don&#39;t remember.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a klutz sometimes, you know that Sweetie?&quot;

Happy at hearing her pet name, Nagisa smiled over at her friend. 
&quot;Sometimes, yeah.&quot;

						~**~

Nagisa sighed as her teacher started the day&#39;s lesson. Somehow she 
managed to avoid her lacrosse members before class, but the ones in her 
class were eyeing her wrapped fingers nervously. It wasn&#39;t as if she 
wanted to prevent from telling them she couldn&#39;t play, but if she had her 
way, she would tell them all at the same time instead of repeating the 
story a million times throughout the day. &#39;Think about the lesson for 
now!&#39; her mind demanded as she picked up her pencil. 

The writing utensil slid from her grasp almost as soon as she picked it 
up.

Blinking, Nagisa lifted her pencil again and held it, realizing that 
with her fingers wrapped she couldn&#39;t properly grip it. The girl let out 
a small growl and tried to hold it a different way although to no 
avail. A third time left the girl right where she was and a fourth faired 
no better. Annoyed, Nagisa tried to hold it like she normally would and 
winced when pain shot through her fingers. The pencil fell to her desk 
and before she could help it, she growled and thumped it annoyingly onto 
the floor.

&quot;Something you&#39;d like to share, Miss Misumi?&quot;  The teacher asked down 
at her student.

&quot;Eh? I, um, no...&quot; Nagisa looked down at her desk, embarrassed. &quot;Just 
dropped my pencil is all...&quot; Reaching for it, Nagisa made a small show 
of failing to pick it up before finally realizing to use her good hand. 

&quot;Did you hurt your hand?&quot; She asked when her pupil sat down again.

&quot;Yes mam,&quot; Nagisa groaned. 

&quot;I see... Miss Yukishiro, you&#39;re left handed aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Honoka stood up at being addressed. &quot;Yes mam?&quot;

&quot;Will you help Miss Misumi until her hand is better?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Honoka looked over at Nagisa and gave her friend a light smile. 

&quot;In that case, Takashimizu, can you swap desk with Misumi for a month?&quot;

Rina stood up. &quot;Yes mam.&quot; As the two swapped places, she patted Nagisa 
on the back to encourage her. 

&quot;Hey there,&quot; Nagisa greeted as she scooted the desk next to her friend. 
&quot;I guess we&#39;re desk buddies for a while.&quot;

&quot;Seems so,&quot; Honoka agreed. When they were situated, the teacher went 
back to her lesson. &quot;Here, hold it like this.&quot; The girl held her hand 
over so Nagisa could look. &quot;I guess it&#39;s the same as you normally would 
but in reverse?&quot;

&quot;Its just hard holding it still,&quot; the blond whispered back, sloppily 
writing her name on the top left hand corner of her notebook.  &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe it, there&#39;s no way I can write kanji like this.&quot;

&quot;Just use hiragana for now,&quot; Honoka held back a laugh. &quot;I&#39;ll write all 
the notes, just practice.&quot; She got a nod in reply and then gave their 
teacher her full attention. An hour passed, then another. Before long 
Honoka had a full page of notes and flipped the paper over to start on a 
second sheet. Looking over at her friend, she bit back a sigh. Her 
friend&#39;s normal handwriting wasn&#39;t the neatest in the world, but using her 
left hand, she managed to make it practically unreadable. Curiosity 
took over after a moment and she began to look at what her friend wrote 
more closely. 

Nagisa had written her name several times along the first few lines, 
and then lapsed into a few half hearted sentences about what the teacher 
had been talking about.  From there she proceeded to write her favorite 
foods and Lacrosse member&#39;s names. Another few sentences about their 
lesson and finally &#39;I can&#39;t believe this&#39; written over and over again. 
Honoka was about to go back to listening to the teacher, but something 
else caught her attention. On the far left of the page she saw her own 
name written a few times, the last one running into the line that had 
Nagisa&#39;s name scribbled several times. What made her stop and stare, 
however, was that the last time her name was written it had a small heart 
around it connecting it with her friend&#39;s name.

The blond noticed her friend looking at her paper and quickly flipped 
her notebook over, cheeks slightly red. &quot;Wha-what?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she whispered back, smiling at the chalk board in the front 
of the room. &quot;Keep at it Nagisa&quot; 

&quot;Hai, hai.&quot;

						~**~

&quot;Lunch time!&quot; Nagisa cheered as the bell rang. &quot;Great, I&#39;m starving!&quot; 
To prove her point, the girl&#39;s stomach rumbled loudly. 

&quot;What happened, what happened, what happened?&quot; Shiho suddenly appeared, 
looking at Nagisa&#39;s hand. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m okay.&quot; Nagisa waved the frantic girl off as more of her 
friends gathered. &quot;I just... kind of broke them.&quot;

&quot;Ehhhh!?&quot; The entire group of girls chorused the same word. 

&quot;I have to run now; I need to go to the cafeteria to get lunch.&quot; Nagisa 
stood nervously. 

&quot;Nagisa, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Honoka picked up her lunchbox and un-wrapped it, 
revealing two boxes. &quot;I made one for you too.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Honoka you&#39;re the best!&quot; Nagisa sat back down in her chair and 
grabbed one of the boxes. Opening it up, she grinned at all the food. 

&quot;Oooh, a &#39;love-box!&#39;.&quot; Shiho cheered, seeing the pink heart in the 
rice.

Nagisa quickly closed the lid and looked at her friends embarrassedly. 
Honoka just grinned at the situation she put her friend in. &quot;So, 
anyway,&quot; Nagisa stammered out as she stood. &quot;I hurt my hand, but it&#39;ll be 
fine in a few weeks. I&#39;ll give everyone the details at Lacrosse practice 
okay? Okay!&quot; Reaching down, she took Honoka&#39;s hand and pulled the girl 
along with her. &quot;Let&#39;s go eat on the roof today.&quot;

&quot;Mou! Its things like this that make everyone say we&#39;re dating.&quot; Nagisa 
whined as they walked to the stairs.

&quot;So you don&#39;t like my lunch?&quot; Honoka sounded a little hurt from the 
comment.

&quot;No, no!&quot; Nagisa quickly gave her friend&#39;s hand a squeeze. &quot;It&#39;s not 
that. It&#39;s just that everyone thinks that we&#39;re going out!&quot;

&quot;If you don&#39;t want them to know we&#39;re going out, why do you hold my 
hand everywhere?&quot;

&quot;Because I like you,&quot; Nagisa opened the door leading outside and held 
it for her friend. &quot;You just haven&#39;t asked me yet.&quot;

&quot;Me? Why should I have to ask!?&quot;

&quot;Because!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the tomboy of the pair, I think you should ask!&quot;

Nagisa brought her hand up to her hair and scratched her head. &quot;Am I 
really that tomboyish?&quot;

&quot;Nagisa&#39;s a tomboy!&quot; Porun popped from Honoka&#39;s purse and latched onto 
the sandy blond. &quot;Tomboy, tomboy-popo!&quot;

&quot;Porun! When did you get in there?&quot; Honoka plucked the child from her 
friend.

&quot;I wanted to visit Mipple-popo.&quot; He replied, looking up at her. &quot;Let&#39;s 
play!&quot;

Nagisa looked around the roof to make sure no one was around before 
talking to the animal. &quot;Porun, don&#39;t sneak out of my bag, I would have 
been scared to death if you wasn&#39;t in there when I looked later.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Porun looked like he was about to cry. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to upset 
you.&quot;

&quot;Aw don&#39;t cry!&quot; Honoka hugged him quickly, trying to prevent a temper 
tantrum. &quot;Here, no one is out here so you can run around but only behind 
the door here okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay!&quot; Porun hopped from her hold and began to do just that, singing a 
song that neither of them knew. 

&quot;Mou, I can&#39;t take my eyes off him for a second...&quot; Nagisa walked over 
to a bench and sat down. &quot;It is kind of chilly up here, no wonder no 
one is here.&quot;

&quot;Too shy to eat my lunch in front of everyone?&quot; Honoka teased her, 
sitting by the girl and scooting close to her to keep warm. &quot;Is Nagisa 
embarrassed? How cute!&quot;

&quot;Mou!&quot; Nagisa pouted at her. &quot;If I&#39;m the tomboy, I guess that makes you 
the one that&#39;s girly enough for two people?&quot;

Honoka put a finger to her chin and thought about it. &quot;I don&#39;t know; 
your room has more stuffed animals than mine...&quot;

&quot;Ha! See? I&#39;m not so tomboyish!&quot; Nagisa went to eat her lunch, but all 
too quickly realized that she couldn&#39;t hold chopsticks in her right 
hand. &quot;Um...&quot;

Honoka came to her rescue by picking up a bite of the food with her 
chopsticks and held it out to her friend. &quot;Say &#39;ahhhh&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Eh!?&quot; Nagisa pulled back a little and shook her head. &quot;I promised 
myself I would never do that.&quot; 

&quot;Oh?&quot; Honoka went to eat the food instead.

&quot;Ah! I still want it!&quot;

&quot;Then say &#39;ahhh&#39;.&quot; Honoka once again offered to feed her. Nagisa 
swallowed and looked away a moment. &quot;Ahhhhh,&quot; Honoka said again, grinning. 
When her friend looked back at her, she slowly leaned forward and opened 
her mouth. &quot;There you go,&quot; The blue haired girl fed her friend the bite 
and giggled at the blush she received for it. &quot;How about some shrimp 
next?&quot; She took some and held it up.

The pair finished their meal slowly, much to the delight of one and the 
embarrassment of the other. Porun interrupted them once asking to play 
but soon saw a bird that took his attention from them long enough to 
forget about it. Now full and content, the two looked up at the sky 
lazily. &quot;We sure have been through a lot, huh?&quot; Nagisa asked idly, holding 
up her hand to look at it.

&quot;Yeah. I still remember the first time; in the amusement park with 
Pissardo. It was so sudden.&quot;

&quot;Kind of makes you wonder what would have happened if he hadn&#39;t 
retreated when he did... If he fought like he did the last time we met...&quot; 

&quot;We would have found a way to win,&quot; Honoka determined. &quot;Somehow. Even 
if we weren&#39;t as close as we are now.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve argued a few times, haven&#39;t we?&quot;  Nagisa grinned at the 
memories. &quot;Each time we got a little stronger.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Honoka looked over at her friend and shivered when the wind 
blew around them.

&quot;Here, you&#39;ll get cold.&quot; The blond lifted her arm up and scooped Honoka 
up to her side. 

Blushing darkly, Honoka rested her head up against Nagisa&#39;s neck. &quot;How 
come you can be so shy around other people but so open when we&#39;re 
alone?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Nagisa looked down at her at put their foreheads 
together. &quot;Everyone thinks we&#39;re together anyway?&quot;

&quot;We are,&quot;

&quot;Are we?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot; Honoka stuck out her tongue. &quot;You just asked me inadvertently.&quot; 

&quot;I did?&quot;

&quot;You did.&quot;

&quot;Well then. If you&#39;re my girlfriend, I can kiss you, right?&quot; Nagisa 
pecked Honoka&#39;s nose in a playful kiss. &quot;There, now it&#39;ll heal faster.&quot;

Honoka let out a laugh. &quot;You&#39;re so cute sometimes, Sweetie.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I should give you a pet name too.&quot; Suddenly she grinned. &quot;How 
about &#39;cupcake&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Eh!?&quot;

&quot;Or Sugar? Muffin? Sugar-muffin? Honey?&quot; Each word made Honoka&#39;s cheeks 
get darker. &quot;How about &#39;Candy&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a food you know,&quot; Honoka glared at her from the corner of her 
eyes. &quot;You&#39;re just saying that stuff to get even for feeding you.&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Nagisa leaned over and whispered in her ear. &quot;How about 
&#39;Sexy&#39;, or &#39;kitten&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Nagisaaaa,&quot; Honoka whined, closing her eyes and feeling her cheeks get 
warmer. &quot;You&#39;re embarrassing me, you win already!&quot;

&quot;Or maybe &#39;Sex Kitten&#39;?&quot; Nagisa kissed her neck teasingly and felt 
Honoka grip her arm. &quot;Like that one?&quot; She kissed the same spot again and 
heard her girlfriend gasp out shyly. Grinning, Nagisa placed her lips on 
the side of Honoka&#39;s neck and sucked. Honoka&#39;s hold on her tightened, 
but she did nothing to stop her other than muttering something about 
being in front of Porun.

&quot;What&#39;cha doing?&quot; The small animal suddenly inquired, scaring Nagisa 
enough to pull back and fall off the bench. &quot;Why were you biting her 
neck?&quot; The small prince looked at the spot and quickly cried out. &quot;Oh noes, 
Nagisa is a vampire!&quot; With that, he jumped into Honoka&#39;s arms and 
buried his head in her chest. &quot;Don&#39;t turn into a vampire Honoka!&quot;

&quot;S-She&#39;s not a vampire,&quot; Honoka told him, rubbing her neck and 
stammering out as best she could. &quot;She was just....I mean...&quot; Turning to 
her friend for support, she saw Nagisa grinning like an idiot giving her 
a peace sign. &quot;You&#39;re not helping, Nagisa!&quot;

&quot;Ah, there you!&quot; A new voice suddenly made them all turn to see Shiho 
and Rina. &quot;Class starts soon, you need to come back inside!&quot;

&quot;Ah, I forgot you can&#39;t hear the bell out here!&quot; Nagisa quickly stood 
up and grabbed the now empty lunch boxes. &quot;Come on Honoka; let&#39;s get 
back inside where it&#39;s warm.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m plenty warm now thanks to you,&quot; Honoka whispered to herself as she 
stood, holding Porun like a stuffed animal. 

&quot;What&#39;s on your neck? Rina asked, tilting her head to look at Honoka. 
&quot;How did you get bruised there?&quot;

&quot;Let me see, let me see, let me see!&quot; Shiho ran over to the girl and 
looked. &quot;It&#39;s a hickey!&quot; 

&quot;It is not!&quot;

Nagisa ran to the door and went through it before her friends could ask 
anymore questions.

					~**~

&quot;So that&#39;s the story,&quot; Nagisa told her teammates. &quot;I can&#39;t play a game 
for a few weeks. Sorry.&quot; She bowed down, getting several whispers 
between the lacrosse team. 

&quot;Well, I can&#39;t say it&#39;ll be nice having to bench our top player, but I 
definitely don&#39;t want your hand to heal wrong.&quot; Their captain sighed. 
&quot;Can you still hold your racket?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s just not really steady since I can&#39;t grip it just right.&quot;

&quot;Okay, Nagisa I want you to take as many spare balls as we have and 
work with our goalie.&quot; Their coach thought about what she was about to 
say. &quot;...Try to shoot both left and right handed. If you can manage to 
swap your dominate hand at any given time in a match, it&#39;ll throw off the 
other team. As for the rest of you, we&#39;re going to practice on the 
other side of the field. I want no one to get anywhere near Nagisa until 
her hand gets better, understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes mam!&quot; The team cheered together.

&quot;Are you going to practice?&quot; Honoka asked Nagisa, walking up to the 
group.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll come to your place after it&#39;s over?&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll let grandmother know you&#39;re staying again.&quot;

&quot;Thanks a lot, Honoka&quot; Nagisa gave her a thankful look. 

&quot;Honoka, did Nagisa really give you a hickey at lunch!?&quot; Mayu suddenly 
asked, making the other girl instantly bring her hand to her neck. &quot;Oh 
my god she did!&quot; Several squeals followed, making Honoka&#39;s face darken. 
She glanced over at Nagisa for support, but found her smiling at her; 
obviously using it to get even for the embarrassment she went through 
while being fed lunch. &quot;So,&quot; Mayu continued. &quot;Are you two girlfriends 
now?&quot;

Honoka turned and walked a few steps before pausing. Looking over her 
shoulder, she gave Nagisa her best evil smile. &quot;Yeah!&quot; She called to 
them. &quot;Nagisa is my sex kitten!&quot; 

The group went silent; all eyes turning to the sandy blond who suddenly 
looked like she was in shock. Honoka stuck out her tongue and mouthed 
out &#39;we&#39;re even&#39; before trotting off happily. 

&quot;Oh my god!&quot;
&quot;Details!&quot;
&quot;I always thought Nagisa would be the aggressive one!&quot;
&quot;Did she really say sex kitten!?&quot;
&quot;Nagisa, since when!?&quot;
&quot;Talk to us!&quot;
&quot;Tell us all about it!&quot;
&quot;Kyaa, I&#39;m so jealous!&quot;
&quot;Nagisa is a kitten, hahaha!&quot;
&quot;Kitten, Kitten, Kitten!&quot;

Nagisa looked around as everyone crowded her. So many questions were 
shot at her at the same time; she didn&#39;t even know where to begin 
sticking up for herself. Finally, she said the one thing that always came 
to mind when she was panicking: &quot;I can&#39;t believe this!&quot;</pre>
