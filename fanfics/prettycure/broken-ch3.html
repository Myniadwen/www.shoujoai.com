<h2>a <a href="../prettycure/index.html">Pretty Cure</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/satashi.html">Satashi</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../prettycure/broken-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Humming to myself, I opened the door to my house and walked into the 
front yard. &quot;Grandmother, I&#39;m home!&quot; I called out, stopping a moment to 
pet my dog. &quot;Hey Chutaro,&quot; I greeted him. &quot;Did you have a good day?&quot; He 
barked at me and ran off to do whatever it is that he does when I&#39;m not 
around. Continuing along my way, I noticed that my grandmother wasn&#39;t 
in her room. I walked around to the kitchen and saw an envelope on the 
counter. Picking it up, I took out some money and read the note along 
with it. &quot;Honoka,&quot; I started aloud. &quot;One of my dear old friends came by 
and we are going out to dinner together. Why don&#39;t you and your friend 
do the same tonight? I already made reservations for you at the French 
restaurant you always want to go to. &quot; A hot blush went across my 
cheeks. This would technically be our first date together, and my first one 
ever.



Honoka looked in the mirror and applied a little more makeup to her 
nose. Although it didn&#39;t swell up like she though it would, it was still 
slow on healing and she had to wear a little thing across it to help it 
mend correctly. Naturally she covered it up so it was barely noticeable 
at all, but she still found herself looking closely at the mirror once 
again while putting in her ear rings. &quot;Okay... How do I look?&quot;

&quot;Pretty-Mipo,&quot; Mipple encouraged. &quot;Why are you so enthusiastic about 
tonight-mipo? You and Nagisa have gone out together several times-Mipo.&quot;

&quot;This is a little different,&quot; Honoka explained as she put on a 
necklace. &quot;We&#39;re going on a date, not just going out.&quot; She wore a light 
blue dress that flared at her waist and matching white high heels. Her hair 
was put up, leaving a few twigs to twirl around her face and neck &quot;I hope 
I&#39;m not going overboard...&quot; A knock came on the door before Mipple 
could reply. &quot;Come in!&quot;

Nagisa opened the door and stepped in slowly; adjusting the collar to 
the button up shirt she wore. The girl had on khaki pants and dark dress 
shoes along with a dull bluish white shirt and a darker undone tie. &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe this stuff was over here.&quot; Nagisa half stated, half 
complained. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d wear it after that stupid reverse beauty 
pageant thing out school had.&quot;

&quot;Aw, you made a cute guy!&quot; Honoka protested her friend as she walked 
over to her. &quot;Besides, it was for charity. Remember how Fujipi looked in 
that dress?&quot; Both girls giggled at the memory and Nagisa went back to 
trying to fix her tie. &quot;Here, let me help.&quot; She reached up and started 
to loop the tie correctly. &quot;You didn&#39;t have to cross dress for me, you 
know.&quot; Her hands went around Nagisa&#39;s collar and straightened it out, 
setting the tie correctly.

&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s the only nice looking cloths I have at your house.&quot; 
Nagisa pulled on her jacket and posed for her friend. &quot;How do I look?&quot;

&quot;Like a perfect boy!&quot; Mepple commented from the inside breast pocket of 
Nagisa&#39;s jacket.

&quot;No one asked you!&quot;

&quot;You look Handsome,&quot; Honoka picked up her purse and Mipple, sliding her 
friend into her pouch and into the bag. &quot;I&#39;m ready too.&quot;

&quot;Then lets go,&quot; Nagisa offered her arm, which Honoka took with a small 
laugh.

						~**~

&quot;Uwah!&quot; Nagisa gaped at the restaurant and the people hanging around 
outside of it while waiting to get an open table. &quot;Honoka... Are you sure 
its okay for us to come here?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, my grandmother made us reservations.&quot;

&quot;I swear she knew we were dating before we did...&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Honoka guided her date towards the entrance and was rewarded 
with Nagisa opening the door for her. 

&quot;Nagisa&#39;s a gentleman!&quot; Porun proclaimed excitedly form Honoka&#39;s purse.

&quot;Porun, you promised you&#39;d be good!&quot; The blue haired girl whispered 
quickly, making the small child get quiet and earning her a few looks. 
&quot;Hehe... left my cell phone on...&quot; Honoka walked into the building 
quickly.

&quot;Good evening, Sir, Madam.&quot; A waiter greeted them as they entered. 
&quot;Table for two?&quot;

Honoka brought her hand to her mouth to try and cover her giggle but 
Nagisa chose to ignore it, more to save herself embarrassment than 
anything else. &quot;We have reservations. Yukishiro.&quot; 

&quot;Ah yes, we&#39;ve been expecting you. This way please.&quot; The waiter showed 
them to their table and handed them both menus. After getting their 
drink orders he left them in peace.

&quot;I really don&#39;t have any sex appeal do I?&quot; Nagisa sighed, hanging her 
head. 

&quot;There, there.&quot; Honoka reached over the table and patted her date on 
the head. &quot;It&#39;s just because you&#39;re wearing that. You&#39;re adorable in a 
dress.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Nagisa opened one eye and looked up at her.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Honoka blinked when her friend suddenly looked scared and 
pulled the menu up in front of herself and buried her face in it. A few 
moments later someone stopped by their table and looked down at her on 
his way by. It took the girl a moment to recognize who it was, but he 
spoke first.

&quot;Yukishiro, fancy seeing you here.&quot; Takashi greeted her merrily. &quot;You 
look lovely tonight, are you out on a date?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Honoka replied shyly.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Takashi spoke to Honoka&#39;s date and offered his 
hand. &quot;Take care of my friend all right?&quot; When he got no reply he tried 
again. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;

Realizing she probably couldn&#39;t get away with hiding without 
embarrassing Honoka or being discovered anyway, Nagisa lowered her menu. 
&quot;Hey dad...&quot;

&quot;Nagisa!&quot; He looked over at Honoka a moment, why had a faint reddish 
tint to her cheeks and then back to his daughter who found her fingers 
suddenly really interesting. &quot;Oh... Oh!&quot; Reaching back, he scratched the 
back of his neck. &quot;I won&#39;t disturb you two then.&quot; He took one step away 
before looking back over at his daughter. &quot;Hey, Nagisa?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; She turned to look at him.

&quot;Come home soon okay kiddo? I miss you being around.&quot; He winked at her.

For the first time in the past few days Nagisa felt like smiling at her 
family again. &quot;Okay Dad, I&#39;ll be home tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Have fun you two!&quot; He waved one more time before continuing along his 
way and eventually meeting up with his wife at a table across the floor 
form them.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t bad,&quot; Honoka said after they got their drinks.

&quot;I think my dad new I was bi for a while now... My mom on the other 
hand...&quot; A moment later they heard a loud surprised outbreak that was 
quickly quieted back down. &quot;Yeah, that was her...&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot;

							~**~

&quot;How about a movie?&quot; Nagisa asked as they walked out of the restaurant 
and into the now crisp night air. &quot;My treat.&quot;

&quot;Sure, I&#39;d love to.&quot; A small breeze ran by them, making the girl shiver 
lightly. Before she could even bring her hands up to rub her bare arms 
she found a jacket placed around her shoulders. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Honoka 
pulled it close around her. &quot;You know, its kind of nice having a girl as a 
boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;She knows just what to do all the time to make me happy,&quot; Honoka 
nudged up against her, getting Nagisa to put her arm around the girl. 
&quot;See?&quot;

&quot;Haha, I guess you&#39;re right. But don&#39;t get used to me cross dressing, 
next date I want to wear a dress.&quot;

&quot;Of course! You have to wear lipstick too; I&#39;ve never seen you in 
lipstick.&quot;

&quot;Hey now, lets not go overboard!&quot;

&quot;I can loan you some of mine! I&#39;ll do your makeup for you!&quot; Honoka 
grinned at her date, whom was looking unsure of herself. &quot;You&#39;re so much 
fun to tease.&quot;

&quot;Hey! You already got me back. Everyone is calling me &#39;S.K.&#39; thanks to 
you.&quot;

&quot;S.K? What&#39;s that mean?&quot;

Nagisa blushed and looked back in front of her as they walked. 
&quot;Nothing, don&#39;t worry about it. Oh look!&quot; She pointed to a small store. 
&quot;Let&#39;s get a drink or something in here so we don&#39;t have to pay for 
overpriced stuff at the theater.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to sneak in drinks to a movie?&quot;

&quot;Yup!&quot; Nagisa gave her a peace sign. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot; With that 
she took off at a small sprint and into the store.

&quot;I wonder where she gets those bad habits from?&quot; Honoka asked aloud, 
intending for Mipple or Porun to answer her, but instead a voice beside 
her spoke up.

&quot;From her father,&quot; Rie said, walking next to Honoka. &quot;He&#39;s in there 
right now doing the same.&quot;

&quot;Hello Miss Misumi,&quot; Honoka greeted, bowing lightly. 

&quot;Hello Yukishiro-dear.&quot; Nagisa&#39;s mother smiled down at her. &quot;I heard 
you were on a date tonight?&quot;

&quot;... Yes mam.&quot; Honoka looked down lightly, embarrassed. &quot;I hope you 
don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;I was a little surprised, but I don&#39;t mind. Whatever makes my little 
girl happy.&quot; Rie laughed lightly. &quot;Right now, though, she isn&#39;t too 
happy with me.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s over it, I think.&quot; Honoka looked up and gave her an encouraging 
smile. &quot;She just had a really bad day. Along with the medicine she got 
at the hospital, it probably just overloaded her.&quot;

&quot;Mou, Dad, you&#39;re so mean!&quot; Nagisa laughed as the pair walked out of 
the store together and over to their dates. &quot;Ah, Mom, good evening.&quot;

&quot;Hey Nagisa.&quot; Rie hugged her daughter, much to her displeasure. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry I upset you!&quot;

&quot;Mom, not in front of my date, you&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot; Nagisa 
protested shyly. 

&quot;Well well, it seems we have a crowd today.&quot; A new voice sprang up, 
making the four people look around. 

&quot;It would appear so, Belzei.&quot; 

Honoka and Nagisa instinctively looked up in the air, seeing two of the 
Dark Warriors above them. &quot;White will be reflected...&quot; Porun stated, 
voice trembling. &quot;I&#39;m scared-popo! Honoka, don&#39;t leave me-popo!&quot;

&quot;This way,&quot; Nagisa commanded as her parents looked up as well. The four 
of them ran into an alleyway beside the store while Nagisa whispered to 
her friend. &quot;Honoka, go left at the end, we&#39;ll split from my parents 
there.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be getting away,&quot; Juna flew down in front of them, 
making them all stop.

&quot;It&#39;s past time to end this,&quot; Belzei landed behind them.

&quot;Not good,&quot; Honoka spoke as she stood by Nagisa.

&quot;Stand back girls,&quot; Takashi stood in front of the group, facing Juna. 
&quot;I&#39;m going to distract them; all of you run for it okay?&quot;

&quot;Darling, you can&#39;t!&quot; Rie&#39;s protest was cut off as her husband prepared 
himself.

&quot;How cute,&quot; Juna snarled, dashing forward with his fist drawn back to 
strike. &quot;You&#39;ll be the first to fall tonight!&quot;

Instantly the two young girls of the group dropped down, both sliding 
their foot across the ground and tripping Takashi so he fell backwards 
and the attack soared over him without damage.

&quot;Don&#39;t try to be a hero, Dad!&quot; Nagisa screamed at him.
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry Mister Misumi!&quot; Honoka added in.

Juna hopped back to cut off their path of escape while Takashi pulled 
himself off the ground. Nagisa looked over her shoulder, then back to 
Juna. Licking her lips, she turned back to her father, who was rubbing 
his backside from the fall but was otherwise unhurt. &quot;I can&#39;t let them 
get hurt...&quot; She spoke softly to herself. Closing her eyes, she battled 
herself mentally. &quot;I can&#39;t involve them... I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Nagisa!&quot; Honoka stood next to her again.

&quot;Honoka!&quot; Nagisa opened her eyes, slight tears coming from the corners 
of them. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t-&quot; She stopped speaking when Honoka held up 
Mipple in one hand and her Queen card in the other.

&quot;You can&#39;t let them get hurt, right?&quot; She gave her girlfriend a smile. 
&quot;You&#39;d do it for me too, if it was my grandmother, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

&quot;Are you two going to talk or you going to fight!?&quot; Belzei taunted 
them. 

&quot;What do you think!?&quot; Nagisa pulled Mepple out from her pocket and the 
Queen card came to her call.

&quot;We&#39;re going to fight!&quot; Honoka added in, slashing her card.

&quot;Duel Aura Wave!&quot; They cried in unison as Nagisa slashed her card as 
well. The light blinded everyone looking for a brief moment and when they 
could see again, Pretty Cure was standing where the two girls once 
were.

&quot;Emissary of light, Cure Black!&quot; Nagisa started.

&quot;Emissary of light, Cure White!&quot; Honoka finished.

&quot;We are Pretty Cure! Servant of the dark powers! Return to the darkness 
from which you came from!&quot; 

&quot;Can&#39;t you ever think of anything new to say!?&quot; Juna called as he 
attacked, getting deflected by Cure Black and knocked aside from her 
partner.

&quot;Servant of the dark powers, return to the darkness before I kick you 
butt and force you to!&quot; Nagisa re-posed, pointing at them both. The two 
dark warriors stared at the girl a moment before lunging forward.

&quot;I need you two to run away from here,&quot; Cure White spoke to Nagisa&#39;s 
parents. They were both against the wall of the ally, watching their 
daughter fight, too shocked to say anything. &quot;Listen to me!&quot; She demanded, 
getting their attention. &quot;As soon as I run in, you two get away from 
here. Fast!&quot; Takashi nodded quickly, putting an arm around his wife. &quot;Get 
home... We&#39;ll call you.&quot; Cure White turned and looked at the battle 
going on.

Seeing a chance, Cure White leapt into the mix and kicked Belzei as he 
was thrown into the air. The man flew towards the ground and after a 
well placed punch from Cure Black, Juna was tossed into the line of 
decent and the two people crashed together.

&quot;Why did you guys have to pick tonight!?&quot; Cure Black demanded as her 
partner landed next to her. &quot;Do you plan to interrupt us when we do 
something!?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have time to keep messing around,&quot; Belzei stepped forward and 
held out his hand. &quot;Now, tell me where the power of the stones are!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re up your-&quot;

&quot;Black!&quot; White scolded her. 

&quot;Incoming!&quot; Black cut a back flip and twirled in the air to avoid an 
energy blast. Landing on White&#39;s outstretched arm, she braced herself as 
her partner spun around and launched her back towards their enemies. 
Juna met the attack with a roundhouse that was neatly deflected. He 
continued to turn and lash out his other foot but White was already below 
him in a sweep kick. Cure Black reached down and balanced herself on 
White&#39;s up-stretched hand and used it to pivot her body in an upside down 
whirlwind kick that sent Belzei crashing into a wall. The two girls 
regained their footing and stood next to each other, glaring at the two 
opponents. 

Cure White was the first to attack again, dashing forward with her arm 
reared back to strike. Juna reached forward to grab the smaller fist 
but found the girl suddenly drop to the ground and slide underneath him. 
In her replacement, Cure Black attacked with a jump kick that bowled 
the large man over thanks to White unbalancing him. Black landed on top 
of him and wasted no time in continuing the advantage by punching 
Belzei. The smaller man blocked but found two feet under his chin as White 
shot back up from the ground. Black grabbed her partner and twirled the 
girl around herself, knocking Juna back away no sooner than he got back 
up. The two claimed their battle stance, now back to back and holding 
hands.

Before either of them could make an attack a new force fell down, 
lashing a foot between them and making the pair let go of each other. 
Regine threw out both arms and knocked the girls in different directions.

&quot;Got you!&quot; Juna screamed, holding out his hands and creating something 
like a mirror. A large flash of light blinded White and before she 
could see again, she was imprisoned in a large cube that covered half of 
the alleyway. 

&quot;White!&quot; Cure Black looked around suddenly scared that she could no 
longer see her partner. &quot;Where did you take her!?&quot;

&quot;Black! I&#39;m right here!&quot; White ran to the side of the cube and pounded 
on it. &quot;I&#39;m right here! Black! Here!&quot;

&quot;She can&#39;t hear you,&quot; Juna spoke calmly, crossing his arms. &quot;The 
darkness is bending the light, reflecting everything away from us. From the 
outside it&#39;s as if nothing is here. This includes your voice.&quot;

&quot;Let me out of here!&quot; White threw out her arm. &quot;Before I get really 
mad!

&quot;I have no intentions to fight with you in here,&quot; Juna narrowed his 
eyes. &quot;We learned before that the two of you fight harder when you&#39;re 
separate. This time we&#39;ll remove that will that drives you together and 
finish you one at a time.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t allow it!&quot; White ran forward, but Juna once again created the 
mirror in front of him. White stopped her assault and jumped backwards, 
gasping at the device. 

&quot;Thank you for the surprised look,&quot; the man congratulated her. &quot;Regine, 
I have it!&quot; The mirror was thrown from the cube and the female of the 
trio caught it. The two inside looked over to the battle going on 
outside.

&quot;If you really want to see your partner that bad, have a look!&quot; Belzei 
held up his hand and White saw a Zakenna leap out from Regine and 
caught by the small man. The red girl in curls then held the mirror, 
reflecting a beam at the monster making an image of a shocked Cure White 
appear over it.

&quot;White!&quot; Cure black gripped her fist. &quot;Give her to me!&quot;

&quot;Black! That&#39;s not me!&quot; White screamed, pounding on the cube wall 
frantically. &quot;Black!&quot;

&quot;You want her? Then by all means!&quot; Belzei reared back his hand and 
slammed his fist into the back of the fake Cure White. His hand continued 
through the mist of the Zakenna and appeared out the front, spraying 
fake blood.

&quot;White!!&quot; Cure black&#39;s pupils went small in shock seeing her friend get 
impaled. &quot;Wh....Wh...&quot;

Belzei pulled his fist back; making the fake Cure white gasp out 
lightly and fall to the ground with a small thump sound. Blood leaked from 
the wound in her body and her eyes closed lightly, head falling to the 
side lifeless. &quot;One down,&quot; Belzei said triumphantly as Black fell to her 
knees.

&quot;It&#39;s not me!&quot; White screamed so hard her throat hurt. &quot;Black! I&#39;m 
here! It&#39;s not me!&quot;

&quot;The will to get to your partner gives you power,&quot; Juna spoke behind 
her. &quot;She will fall easily after seeing your fake death, and once she is 
gone, you too will be easy prey.&quot;

&quot;How does it feel seeing your partner die?&quot; Belzei asked as he landed, 
nudging the lifeless Zakenna with his foot. 

&quot;....I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; Black whispered faintly, gripping her fist as 
tears stung her eyes.

&quot;It was so easy,&quot; Belzei continued, walking forward. &quot;Such a weakling.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; The voice was a little louder, barely coming from 
her mouth.

Belzei continued his slow pace to the girl on her knees. &quot;It&#39;s a shame 
she gave us so much trouble in the past. This didn&#39;t have to happen.&quot;

&quot;Kill you... I&#39;ll kill you...&quot;Black choked on her words, getting 
louder. &quot;Kill you.... Kill...&quot;

&quot;Eh? You saying something?&quot; Belzei crossed his arms and smirked.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill you!!&quot; Black screamed, lifting her head with a snap. 
Belzei&#39;s eyes went wide as the figure of the girl faded out and was 
replaced much closer to him. Black slammed her fist into his stomach and 
screamed. Before he could move backwards from the attack she punched again, 
this time creating a small shockwave that blew the man all the way across 
the alley.

The girl appeared behind him and lashed out her foot. Belzei yelled in 
pain but the cry couldn&#39;t be heard over the frantic screaming of the 
girl hitting him. The few seconds it took Regine to get to them, Belzei 
was already too weak to move. &quot;You too!&quot; Black choked out. &quot;I&#39;ll kill 
you too! All of you!&quot;

&quot;Black! Black calm down!&quot; White pressed both her hands on the wall and 
started to cry. &quot;Black!&quot; Juna leapt from the cube and passed through it 
easily, joining the battle. With his help the berserk girl was thrown 
back into a wall, which she repelled off of and dashed forward again, 
leaving three afterimages of herself as she did so. Cure White watched in 
horror as her friend took on all three at the same time. Even in her 
power educing rage she was obviously getting hurt badly. &quot;Black...&quot;

Knocking the three away from her, Black gained some distance and fell 
to one knee. &quot;White...White...&quot; Tears came to her eyes again. &quot;Just 
wait... Just wait White... I&#39;ll see you again when these are taken care 
of.&quot;

&quot;Black! Calm down-Mepo!&quot; 

&quot;Mepple...&quot; Cure black took the pouch from her side and set it on the 
ground. &quot;Don&#39;t worry; the garden will be saved when these three are 
gone. Find the guardian and make sure everyone is at peace okay? The Dark 
King can&#39;t revive if he can&#39;t get the power from these three.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about-Mepo!?&quot; The creature turned into his normal 
state.

&quot;Honoka...&quot; Cure Black looked towards her enemies again and narrowed 
her eyes. &quot;This is for Honokaaaa!&quot; 

The girl blurred as she ran, getting to the middle of the group and 
twisting so she had them all in a lock with her legs and one hand. &quot;Black 
Thunder!&quot; Her free hand shot towards the sky, instantly getting a black 
bolt of lightning. 

&quot;Fool!&quot; Regine snarled, struggling. &quot;Without the white thunder to 
balance your power it&#39;ll...&quot; Her eyes went wide.

&quot;Yhaaaaaaaaa!&quot; The power doubled, blasting everything around them as it 
collected. 

&quot;Black!&quot; Cure White slammed her fist against the cube. &quot;Don&#39;t! You&#39;ll 
die!&quot; She jumped back and held out her hand. &quot;White Thunder!&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Mipple screamed. &quot;White, the power will explode if it&#39;s not 
balanced!&quot;

&quot;I have to try!&quot; She pulled her hand back and gathered the power. 
&quot;Marble screw!&quot; The white bolt of power slammed into the wall and forced 
the girl to slide backwards. As she reached the end of the prison, she 
braced her feet against the wall and leaned forward, crying out as the 
power increased and started to burn her hand. &quot;Nagisaaaa!&quot;

The power shot from the wall of darkness and shattered the effects of 
it. Screaming by, the white lightning slammed into her partner and 
combined into it. All at once the pain was gone and replaced by a warm 
feeling.  When the blast cleared, Cure black fell to her knees and then 
onto her face.

&quot;Nagisa!&quot; Cure White ran forward, ignoring the Zakenna shattering into 
small stars. Mipple came off her waist and joined Mepple, who was 
holding a crying Porun. &quot;Nagisa!&quot; She fell to her knees and put her friends 
head in her lap. &quot;Nagisa...&quot;

Slowly Cure Black opened her eyes and looked up. &quot;Ho...no...ka...?&quot; 

&quot;Nagisa...&quot; a tear fell from her cheek and landed on the sandy blond 
below. 

&quot;Honoka!&quot; Nagisa shot up and hugged her as the power of Pretty Cure 
faded from them. &quot;Honoka! Honoka! Honoka!&quot; The girl buried herself hard 
against her. &quot;But... but I saw...&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t me,&quot; Honoka told her softly, hugging the girl back. &quot;It 
wasn&#39;t me. I&#39;m okay, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;Honoka...I was so scared!&quot; Nagisa&#39;s voice cracked. &quot;I was so scared!&quot;

&quot;You!?&quot; Honoka pulled back a little to look at her. &quot;I was terrified! 
Do you really think I&#39;d be happy if you died after me!? Huh!?&quot;

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Nagisa blinked some tears from her eyes. &quot;When I thought you 
were gone, I... I...&quot; Instead of finishing, she buried her head against 
Honoka&#39;s chest again and cried harder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot;

&quot;Same here!&quot; Mepple suddenly joined in, hopping next to them and 
glaring at Nagisa. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever do something like that again-Mepo!&quot;

&quot;You either Honoka-Mipo!&quot;

&quot;Whaaaaa, you scared me-popo!&quot; Porun leapt onto Honoka and cried hard 
against her sleeve. &quot;Don&#39;t ever leave me mommy!&quot;

&quot;Mommy?&quot; Honoka paused her stroking of Nagisa&#39;s hair and picked up 
Porun to hug him. 

Nagisa took a few steadying breaths and moved to a sitting position. &quot;I 
guess he adopted you as his mother,&quot; She smiled lightly, wiping her 
eyes.

&quot;You too, daddy!&quot; Porun quickly jumped from Honoka to Nagisa and clung 
to her chest. &quot;Don&#39;t get hurt again-popo!&quot;

&quot;Daddy!?&quot; Nagisa awkwardly pet the child. &quot;Why am I your dad?&quot;

&quot;Because-popo!&quot; Porun called out, still in the middle of bawling.

&quot;You make a good father, Nagisa.&quot; Honoka happily took the opportunity 
to think about something else than their battle. 

&quot;Mou, I&#39;m a girl, you know...&quot; She stood up and held Porun with her 
good hand.

&quot;Let&#39;s get home.&quot; Honoka said softly, picking up their friends as they 
turned back into their cell phone like shapes. &quot;It&#39;s been a rough 
night...&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Nagisa helped her friend up and the pair started walking 
together. After a few moments Nagisa reached over and took Honoka&#39;s arm 
with both hers. &quot;Honoka?&quot; She asked softly.

&quot;Yes, sweetie?&quot; Honoka looked over at her and smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.&quot;

&quot;Same to you...&quot; She leaned over and kissed her cheek. 

								~**~

Honoka sat on the bed next to Nagisa and looked down at her. The girl 
was wearing a long tee shirt and was resting comfortably it seemed. 
After the battle they had that night and calling her parents after it was 
over, Honoka wasn&#39;t surprised at all to have her crashed out so early. 
Reaching out, she gently brushed some hair away from Nagisa&#39;s eyes and 
was rewarded with her hand coming up to take her own. &quot;Did I wake you?&quot; 
She asked softly, leaning over.

&quot;No, I was awake.&quot; Nagisa opened her eyes and tenderly reached out to 
pull Honoka down on top of her. &quot;I&#39;m really, really glad you&#39;re okay.&quot;

&quot;I know sweetie. I feel the same way.&quot; Honoka whispered into her ear 
slightly before pulling back enough to rest their foreheads together. 
Honoka took Nagisa&#39;s other hand and slid them up above her head, 
interlacing their fingers on either side. The two looked at each other a 
moment before both closing their eyes and kissing. When it ended, Honoka 
started another kiss, then a third. Nagisa ever so slowly left her 
girlfriends hands and instead wrapped them around her, pulling the girl 
completely on top of her.  Their kiss deepened and before she knew it, 
Nagisa had her legs wrapped around Honoka&#39;s waist lightly. 

The two pulled away slightly and opened their eyes. Honoka smiled down 
at her, leaning forward and kissing her cheek and trailing down her 
neck, where she lightly bit and started to suck. The blond moaned out 
softly and brought her hand up to press on Honoka&#39;s back to encourage her. 
When she was done, Honoka pulled back and was pleased to find a red 
mark where she had just been. She looked back over at Nagisa and smiled as 
she was pulled back to her lips. Their tongues met each other again and 
after a few moments they started breathing heavier, almost panting into 
each other&#39;s mouths. The blue haired girl shyly started to rub her body 
against her girlfriends, getting a much enthusiastic response in her 
mouth. They just began to moan lightly when a voice stopped them.

&quot;What&#39;cha doing?&quot; Both girls stopped quickly and turned to look to the 
side, where Porun was sitting; watching them with a curious look on his 
face. Behind him were Mepple and Mipple, who were sharing a small 
bucket of popcorn. &quot;Ne, why are you two on top of each other?&quot; Porun titled 
his head to the side and used one of his ears to cover one of his eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t watch!&quot; Nagisa cried out, grabbing a pillow from behind her and 
using it to shove them all off the bed. &quot;Mou! I can&#39;t believe this!&quot;

						~**~

&quot;Nagisa!&quot; Honoka called out to her friend as they walked to school. 
After being greeted, she smiled at her girlfriend&#39;s hand. &quot;Today&#39;s the day 
you can play Lacrosse again, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yup!&quot; Nagisa held up her right hand and flexed it. &quot;The doctor said it 
was all healed up and I am free to play as hard as I want!&quot;

&quot;Congratulations!&quot; Honoka cheered, laughing. &quot;Do your best okay!?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Honoka, Nagisa!&quot; Rina ran up to them. &quot;Can you play, 
S.K.?&quot;

&quot;Yup!&quot;

&quot;S.K?&quot; Honoka blinked. &quot;Why is everyone calling you that? I thought it 
was a term for someone who was injured in Lacrosse?&quot;

&quot;Eh!?&quot; Nagisa blushed darkly. &quot;Don&#39;t&#39; worry about it!&quot;

&quot;Good morning, good morning, good morning!&quot; Shiho jumped on Nagisa&#39;s 
back happily. &quot;I heard you can play again, S.K!&quot;

&quot;Shiho!&quot; Nagisa laughed as her friend rode her piggy back style.

&quot;What does it mean!?&quot; Honoka demanded, sniffing. 

&quot;Eh you don&#39;t know?&quot; Shiho blinked.&quot; But, but, but you&#39;re the one who 
gave her that name!&quot;

&quot;Ohhhhhhhhh!&quot; Rina grinned as she realized. &quot;She never told Honoka 
about it and let her think it was a lacrosse term!&quot;

&quot;Rina! Shhhhh!&quot;

&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Honoka asked the girl, confused. &quot;I don&#39;t call her 
that?&quot;

&quot;You did, you did, you did!&quot;

&quot;Think about it,&quot; Rina offered, much to the displeasure of Nagisa. 
&quot;What have you called Nagisa that all the lacrosse players would know about 
and tease her?&quot;

&quot; &#39;Sweetie&#39;,&quot; Honoka replied easily. &quot;But I call her sweetie 
everywhere.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what the &#39;S&#39; stand for!&quot; Shiho told her, finally getting 
down from Nagisa&#39;s back. 

Honoka put a finger to her chin as she thought. &quot;S.K ........ S.K...... 
S......... K ......Kitten....? S...&quot; Her face suddenly lit up. &quot;Sex 
Kitten!?&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s face fell and the other lacrosse players cheered at her. 
&quot;She&#39;s you&#39;re sex kitten!&quot; Rina teased, putting an arm around Nagisa and 
giving her a noogie.

&quot;They&#39;ve been calling you that for over a month!?&quot; Honoka asked, 
smiling like an idiot. &quot;Really? Hahaha!&quot;

&quot;Honoka!&quot;

The girl let her head fall back as she laughed loudly. &quot;Hahaha! 
Hahahaha! Oh my sides hurt!&quot;

Nagisa sniffed and looked down; sure her face was completely red. She 
waved lightly at her friends who went on ahead. &quot;Mou... I didn&#39;t want 
you to find out...&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s adorable,&quot; Honoka told her merrily, walking next to her 
again. Seeing her friend still looking embarrassed, she leaned down and 
whispered in her ear. &quot;My place, after school. Okay, Kitten?&quot; she blew 
lightly in her ear, making Nagisa instantly stand up straight and 
stammer out.

&quot;O-Okay! I-I mean, sure! I mean...&quot; She looked down again, blushing 
horribly.

Honoka smiled, taking her hand. &quot;Come on sweetie, we&#39;ll be late!&quot;

&quot;Ah! Run, run!&quot; The two dashed forward together, holding hands.</pre>
