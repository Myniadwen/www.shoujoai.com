<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? An archery  club?” I couldn’t really believe what I was hearing. Of all the  new clubs that were springing up around school I never expected  archery to be one of them. Honoka started talking about when archery  first started becoming popular but at the moment I was too shocked to  really listen to her. Hikari had just told us that she wanted to join  the club and even got permission from Akane to do so. I brought my  hand to my chin and thought about it for a moment more. I guess it  was about time for her to start interacting more in school  activities. I noticed that it got quiet all of a sudden and looked  up, seeing Honoka waving her hand in front of my face. “Ah….  What?”</span></p>
</span>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Parental</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Satashi </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, Nagisa, I was  talking!” Honoka pouted at her. “You’re normally interested in  these kind of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, sorry Honoka,”  Nagisa bowed lightly. “My mind just wondered on me. What was that  again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bluish-purple  haired girl sighed. “We need to go shopping with Hikari to get her  some equipment. Are you free this Sunday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure!” Nagisa  instantly grinned and put her arms around her friends. “Let’s all  go together!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um….”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it, Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I promised Nao and  Miu that I would go with them this Sunday to watch a movie… I  didn’t think I’d have to buy supplies for the club…” Hikari  looked down lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, don’t mind,  don’t mind.” Nagisa waved it off. “Let’s all go together and  while you’re in the movies Honoka and I can shop around for  ourselves.” She put a hand on the blond girl’s head. “You’ll  need help carrying all that stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose we need to  get a list, too.” Honoka added in, thinking aloud. “Of everything  we should buy. Hikari-san, Nagisa, you two go ahead to Akane’s  Takoyaki stand and I’ll ask the teacher in charge of the club what  we need.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, I can do it!”  Hikari took a step forward, but Nagisa pulled her back playfully and  put her arm around the smaller girl. “Nagisa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You heard her,”  She grinned. “You need to get to work. And I’m starving too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, you just want  food,” Honoka put her hand on her hip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just making  sure Hikari gets there on time is all!” Nagisa laughed out as she  pulled Hikari along with her. “I’ll treat you when you get back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll hold you to  that!” Honoka called out to them as they departed. “That Nagisa…”  Still she brought a hand to her mouth and giggled to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What made you decide  on archery all of a sudden?” Nagisa asked as she led the girl down  the street.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… Nao is  really into basketball and Miu is going to join the science club  soon… Everyone is trying their best and I guess I just want to as  well… I’m not really good at sports or anything so I thought  maybe something like that I would be able to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I see! Well good  luck with it!” The sandy blond stopped walking and pulled Hikari  back as a truck went by them at the intersection. “The light’s  red, Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! I’m sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry.”  Nagisa thought a moment while looking down at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wh…what is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well you’re going  to be at school a lot later now, so be careful on your way home since  it’ll be dark. Don’t dally around and put something warm in your  bag so you won’t get cold at night okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, Nagisa, you  sound like Honoka.” Hikari laughed up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“D-Do I?” Nagisa  scratched the back of her head and guided Hikari with a hand on her  back when the light changed. “I don’t know to say thank you or  get upset that you don’t think I’d say it normally…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pair arrived at  their Takoyaki stand a few moments later and were greeted by several  people hanging around outside it. “Ah, it looks really busy!”  Hikari ran the rest of the way to the portable stand and grabbed an  apron. “Akane, sorry I’m late!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikariiiii!” Akane  held out a large tray. “Table two, please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right away!” the  girl took it and hurried off as others tried to get her attention for  orders. “Ah, sorry! I’ll be right there! Yes sir, just one  moment!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa hopped up in the  bus and picked up a spare apron. “Akane, what should I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you could get the  handy and take orders for me I’d really appreciate it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On it!” Nagisa  picked up the gold device and hurried outside. “Welcome, can I have  your order please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka arrived almost a  half-hour later, looking around at all the people. “My, busy  tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We added a lot of  winter items to the menu,” Hikari told her as she walked past and  picked up a tray to bring out. “It seems we’ve gotten popular.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Honoka  stepped into the bus and smiled at Akane. “Would you like some  help?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you don’t  mind,” Akane smiled at her. “Ah, you girls saved me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mention it.”  Honoka calmly put on an apron and helped the girl prepare the food.  “All the free food you give us more than makes up for these times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An hour passed by  slowly, then another. When the stand finally quieted down Nagisa fell  into a chair and laid her head down on the table. “Hikariiiii, I  don’t know how you do this every day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not bad once  you’re used to it,” She replied happily, waving to the last  customer to leave with his order.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here you go,”  Honoka said softly as she sat down by the girl closely. “One hot  chocolate to warm you right up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, thank you.”  Nagisa took the drink and scooted up by her friend. “Ah, wait a  moment I was supposed to treat you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomorrow,” Honoka  put her finger on Nagisa’s nose. “Let’s each lunch together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” Nagisa  smiled and took a long sip from the mug. “Ah, Akane, this is the  best!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s my family’s  recipe!” She called out from the stand. “On the house, enjoy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari watched her two  friends share the drink while talking to each other. Every now and  then she would see them go out of their way to brush up against each  other and touch their hands when swapping the mug between the two.  “Those two have been like that for a while now,” Akane said,  getting Hikari’s attention. “It started off slow but now they’re  all lovey-dovey with each other all the time now. Ahhh, to be young  again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Hikari looked  at the two once more, seeing Honoka kiss away some whip cream from  Nagisa’s face. “I never really thought about it since they were  always like that when we met. How were they before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akane laughed to  herself. “Those two, total opposites! I still don’t know how they  managed to become friends. Nagisa brought her by the first time and  they tried talking for almost half an hour, neither one finding  anything in common to speak about. Honoka was trying to say something  about her latest science interest while Nagisa was on and on about  lacrosse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…” Hikari  watched the pair again as they cuddled together to get warm while  laughing about something or another.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. It went by  like that for a while, and then the two had a really big falling out.  I’m not sure what it was about, but it really got to Nagisa for  some reason. When they made up they were on a first name basis, and  from then on they had several small arguments but always seemed to  make up and get closer. I think they started having real feelings for  each other a little bit before you came along, Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Nagisa has a  crush on Fujimura-sempai!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh that?” Akane  waved it off. “She’s just in denial about liking girls. Honestly,  for being so open, that one sure does act complicated. One moment  she’s all over Honoka, the next she’s acting shy around some boy.  Drives Honoka insane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Hikari  smiled to herself. “Someone you like, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, what was it you  wanted to tell me earlier before we were so busy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” Hikari  blushed and turned to her. “Well, you see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa picked up her  backpack and placed it on the table before unzipping it. “Thanks  for letting me borrow your notebook,” She started as she looked  through the bag. “I promise I won’t sleep through class again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You better not,”  Honoka teased her. “I won’t always be so lineate with you.” She  saw a small red envelop fall from the bag and picked it up. “What’s  this?” She flipped it over and giggled to herself. “A love  letter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! Give me that!”  Nagisa grabbed the envelope and blushed darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who’s it from?”  Honoka leaned over to look. “Nao? Why does that name sound  familiar?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s Hikari’s  friend,” Nagisa stammered out embarrassed. “It was in my shoe  locker this afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you going  to read it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t really  want to,” Nagisa sighed. “If I open it then I have to write her a  reply… Ah, Honoka!” She made a move to get the letter back, but  Honoka already opened it. “Honokaaaa…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dear Nagisa-sempai,”  She read aloud as her friend let her head fall on the table. “I  have always looked up to you for a long, long time.” Honoka paused  a moment. “How cute, she used the wrong kanji for the word ‘long’.”  She got a small giggle from her friend so she continued to read, now  with a hand on Nagisa’s head, gently massaging her neck. “I want  to be just like you when I grow up, and am going to join the  basketball team and give it my best just like you would! I’ll come  cheer for you at your lacrosse games, so please come to one of my  games as well? With lots of love, Nao.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know why  she wants to be like me,” Nagisa sighed out as her neck was rubbed.  “You’re much better at stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually I got a  letter from Miu,” Honoka told her, getting a surprised look. “It  said the same thing just about. Aren’t they so cute?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka’s gotten a  letter from a girl; I think I’m rubbing off on her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,” Honoka put  her fingertip on the middle of the back of Nagisa’s neck and  pressed down before running it down to her spine. The girl had a full  body shiver and sat up, blushing hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t do that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t do what?”  Honoka replied in a whisper, leaning close to the girl so their faces  were close. “You’re blushing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-Honoka…”  Nagisa smiled at her shyly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, now-now you two,  don’t get hot and heavy at my stand, you’ll drive away my  customers!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girls instantly  scooted away from each other. “Akane, we’re not getting hot and  heavy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right, right!” She  waved her hand un-interestedly. “Anyway, you’re going shopping  this Sunday with Hikari and her friends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Honoka  nodded. “Should we pick her up at your place?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can meet you at  the station!” Hikari took a step forward. “You don’t have to go  out of your way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, don’t  worry.” Nagisa stood up and grabbed her backpack. “We’ll come  pick you up so you won’t be alone.” The two girls walked over to  the light blond and Nagisa once again put her hand on her head. “See  you tomorrow, Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” She reached  up and plucked the hand from her head and grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye bye,  Hikari-san.” Honoka bowed lightly to her before also saying her  goodbye to Akane.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Honoka, I’m here!”  Nagisa called out as she walked through the door leading into  Honoka’s yard.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, you’re here  early,” Honoka greeted her, looking out of her bedroom door. “Just  a moment, I need to finish getting dressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing,”  Nagisa nodded and leaned against the sliding door, looking out in the  yard as Chutaro ran around chasing a moth. “Dad drove me here, he’s  going to take us to Hikari’s house and then to the train station.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” asked from  inside the room. “That’s nice of him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He was worried about  us being cold since its morning.” Nagisa held back a laugh. “I  don’t get cold!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, you get sick.”  Honoka teased as she slid open her door and smiled at her friend.  “I’m ready!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You look cute  today.” Nagisa looked at her friend. She was actually wearing blue  jeans and a fluffy turtle neck black sweater with a blue dove on it.  To top it off her usually flowing hair was swept back in a ponytail.  “Honoka in pants, I’m impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I have plenty  of pants!” Honoka pouted at her and walked past. Nagisa tried to  resist the urge but fell prey to it and slapped her friend lightly on  the butt. “Kya! Nagisa!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, sorry!”  Nagisa laughed out as her friend blushed. “I couldn’t resist!  They’re so tight!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez, I have to keep  you on a leash.” Honoka pulled her purse over her shoulder and  offered her hand to her friend, despite the teasing just received.  “Grandmother, we’re heading off now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have a good time  dears.” The old lady waved at them as they left the house.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you for the  ride, Misumi-san,” Honoka greeted as she got in the van.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anytime  Yukishiro-chan!” He replied happily before driving off to pick up  their final friend. “Oh, you’re not wearing a dress today?”  Nagisa laughed to herself at Honoka’s embarrassed expression. “A  shame, you always have the prettiest dresses. Unlike Nagisa here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that  supposed to mean!?” Nagisa leaned over to glare at her dad while  Honoka got a good laugh at her this time. The van rolled to a stop  outside Akane and Hikari’s house and Honoka hopped out to retrieve  the girl while Nagisa argued with her father playfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka knocked on the  door and waved at Hikari when it opened up. “Good morning, Hikari,”  She got a happy greeting back but the older girl paused a moment when  she noticed her friend’s choice of clothing. “It’s getting cold  lately, don’t you think you should wear something more covering?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari blinked a moment  and looked down at her frilly pink shirt that showed her shoulders.  “Eh? I didn’t really think about it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,  Honoka!” Akane greeted as she looked out the door. “I hate to ask  a favor so early in the morning, but do you think Hikari could stay  with you tonight or tomorrow night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” Honoka  blinked. “I don’t mind, but why so suddenly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My high school  re-union location got changed so more people could make it, but now I  have to drive a bit off and stay for two days. I don’t want Hikari  to be by herself, so if it’s not too much trouble…please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But this Monday is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry  Akane-san; I’m sure I’ll be okay if I stay at the house by  myself, hehehe.” Hikari laughed nervously and lightly pushed Honoka  along her way to the van. “Bye bye Akane-san, have fun on your  trip!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari, but Monday  is the day the new clubs are created and they have the parent-teacher  meetings about them…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s an important  time for her,” Hikari whispered back as they walked to the van.  “She’s been looking forward to it for almost a month now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw…” Honoka  looked over her shoulder at the waving lady in the house. “Mou, you  didn’t even tell her did you?”  Hikari stuck her tongue out in  response when they boarded the van.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You need me to pick  you up when you’re done shopping?” Takashi asked her daughter as  the girls got out of the van.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll be all  right, enjoy your day off.” Nagisa walked over to the driver’s  side and thanked her father for the ride.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay then,” He  reached out and put his hand on Nagisa’s head. “Be good, hear  me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Daaad, I’m not a  little kid anymore.” She reached up and took his hand off her head  and smiled. “See you tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye then.” He  looked over at the other two girls. “Bye girls!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye Misumi-san!”  Hikari waved at him while Honoka bowed lightly. When he drove off,  Hikari turned and trotted up the stairs to the train station and  looked around for her friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikariiiiiii!” Nao  called out as the two girls ran up to her. “You’re early!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are you two!”  Hikari hugged both her friends as they started chatting excitedly  about their plans for the day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we’re going to  party like its new years day!” Nao cried out finally, hopping.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean new year’s  night,” Miu corrected her, grinning. “Partying on new years has  been a tradition since…” Hikari lightly laughed to herself as her  friends imitated Nagisa and Honoka, ending with them both holding  hands and crying out “Just like that! Just like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s… almost  like looking in a mirror,” Nagisa said uneasily, looking at the  girls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yeah…” Honoka  smiled weakly as the two young girls froze at seeing their role  models.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa-san and  Honoka-san are going to help me shop later on today,” Hikari  explained to her nervous friends. “I hope you don’t mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-not at all!”  They chorused out together, bowing deeply to the older girls. “I-It’s  our pleasure!” their voiced were synced again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa didn’t really  know what to say to them so Honoka came to her rescue. “Let’s  have lots of fun today, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right!” They once  again said the same word together, making Hikari laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do we… do that  too?” Honoka asked her friend while the train pulled up and got  everyone’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think so…  you just… kind of say what I’m thinking a lot of the time before  I have the chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry about that,”  Honoka giggled and took her hand, pulling the girl onto the train  before the doors closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look, look, they’re  holding hands!” Nao whispered to Miu enviously. “The rumors are  true, they are a couple!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kyaaa, I’m so  jealous!” Miu whispered back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A couple, huh?”  Nagisa looked out the window, watching the scenery go by. “I guess  everyone thinks that if even the freshmen are saying it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mind?” Honoka  asked lightly, interlacing their fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” The  sandy blond smiled at Honoka’s reflection in the glass. “Not at  all, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me either,” She  took a small step closer to her and took Nagisa’s arm with her  other hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari just smiled at  them while her friends squealed out in delight at seeing ‘such a  romantic moment’ between their heroes. The moment was shattered,  however, when the girl let out a small sneeze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari, you need to  cover up more.” Nagisa released Honoka’s hand and slid her hot  pink jean jacket off, leaving her in just a black tight fitting long  sleeve with the word ‘lacrosse’ written on it in English. “Here,  put this on.” She flipped it around the girl and encouraged her to  slide her arms through the sleeves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But won’t you get  cold?” Hikari asked embarrassedly, even though she was thankful to  the new warmth she had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t get cold,”  Nagisa repeated her phrase and winked. “I don’t want you to get  sick, so wear it okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“O-okay.” Hikari  buttoned it up and posed to her two younger friends. “How is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw, you look like a  rock star!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rock star…?”  Nagisa sighed out and hung her head. “Do any of my cloths look  feminine?”  Honoka brought her hand to her lips to cover a giggle.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What movie are you  going to watch?” Honoka asked the three girls. The mall had its own  movie theater inside it, which they were all currently standing.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The new nightmare on  Elm Street!” Nao said instantly, making Honoka frown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That movie is too  graphic for you girls, you need to watch another one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…” Nao looked  at Nagisa for support.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…” the sandy  blond scratched her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’ll give you  nightmares,” Honoka went on. “The violence is really scary too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s a fun  kind of scary!” Miu protested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on,  Honoka-san!” Hikari joined in, hopping in place. “We want to see  it!” She looked over at Nagisa as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Taking a breath, Nagisa  stepped forward. “Listen to Honoka, Hikari, she knows what’s  best.” She put her hand on her hips. “No means no, so don’t  argue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes mam...” the  three girls looked a little dejected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll be glad you  didn’t watch it.” Honoka looked at her watch. “You run along  now and pick another movie before they start. We’ll meet up in five  hours so don’t forget to come back here okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay!” the three  girls ran away from them and inside the theater.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice job, Nagisa,”  Honoka congratulated her with a smile. “I’m proud of you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted to see it  too…” she sighed and hung her head, receiving a small pat from  her partner.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What are we going to  watch?” Hikari asked as they stood in line for tickets.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nightmare on Elm  Street!” Nao replied instantly with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Honoka said…”  Miu looked over at Hikari, then Nao. “Oh! I get it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Won’t we get in  trouble?” Hikari looked at them timidly. “If we do something they  said not to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, they  won’t find out.” Miu encouraged her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My parents told me  not to watch it too, but if you do everything they tell you, you’ll  never have any fun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Parents, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” Nao covered  her mouth. “I’m sorry… I forgot…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari shook her head.  “Don’t worry about it.” She put on a big smile for her friends.  ‘<em>Parents… I wonder what its like to have parents…</em>?’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Parents are a  wonderful thing,” A calm soothing voice told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>You again!</em>’  Hikari thought to the voice, shocked. ‘<em>Tell me! What are  parent’s like!?</em>’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Parents are people  who always look out for you,” The voice told her sweetly. “They’ll  always protect you, encourage you when you’re down, and scold you  when you do something wrong so you’ll learn from it. But don’t be  discouraged. You have people just like that all around you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I do?’</em> Hikari closed her eyes and thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do,” the voice  made her feel calm again. “You just have to look for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari!” Miu’s  voice made the girl come back to reality. “Come on, you’re  holding the line.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! Sorry!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Think Hikari’s  having fun with her friends?” Nagisa mused as she sipped her drink  casually through a swirly straw. She was sharing a rather large girly  looking drink with her friend known as ‘lover’s delight’ in the  food court.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably. I bet they  watched that new romantic comedy that just came out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean ‘Random  stereo-type generic chick-flick title’?” Nagisa rolled her eyes  uninterestedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka laughed at that.  “Nagisa, you’re such a tomboy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha!? Am not!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hikari screamed bloody  murder as the villain of the movie leapt from the water and grabbed a  hold of one of the teenagers. “Hereeeeeeee’s Freddy!” He cried  out before pulling back his claws and slashing. The three girls all  grabbed a hold of each other tightly and screamed out again, much to  the displeasure of the rest of the movie watchers.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What do you think?”  Honoka asked, opening the door of the changing room and appearing in  a tight leather miniskirt and a shirt that showed off her stomach and  shoulders. “Nagisa?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ja-jaan!” the door  beside her opened and Nagisa emerged in a frilly pink dress that went  almost to her knees. “What do you think Honoka? Tomboy this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two girls looked at  each other a moment before breaking out into a helpless fit of  laughter.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hikari hugged her  friends tightly while they watched the movie. Although they were  breathing a little fast and scared clean out of their minds, their  eyes refused to leave the screen. A flash of lightning lit the screen  and a clawed hand shot from under a bed and grabbed a girl, tripping  her and starting to drag her under it. The three once again cried out  in terror and gripped each other so hard it almost hurt.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Want a bite,  Honoka?” Nagisa asked around a mouthful of a cookie, turning to  face her on the mall bench with a little bit of the treat hanging  from her mouth. “Take some, I’m full.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?” She blushed  darkly as Nagisa wiggled the cookie from her lips. “Na….gisa…?”  A moment went by before she slowly leaned over and placed her lips  around the cookie, brushing against the other girl’s in the  process. She bit and found the little bit of left over between their  lips start to fall. Instinctively she tried to catch it with her  mouth, giving Nagisa a hard kiss with a slight flash of tongue across  her lips. She pulled back quickly and tried to stammer out an  apology, but Nagisa only smiled at her and put an arm around the  girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you wanted to  kiss me, you could just ask,” Nagisa teased her, licking a crumb  off Honoka’s cheek.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The three girls weakly  made their way out of the movie theater, looking like they had all  just seen the seven levels of hell and barely came back to tell the  tale of it. “Never again…” Miu managed out, rubbing her eyes.  “I’m never listening to you ever again…”
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa sighed as she  held several bags of Honoka’s as the other girl excitedly shopped  around the dress store. Despite her earlier declaration of not being  a tomboy, she had yet to find a single thing in the current shop that  even remotely interested her. Honoka on the other hand was fawning  over bracelets and little trinkets that go on them. After making  several trips around the store and coming back to one particular  silver bracelet, they decided to leave the store.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time around it was  Honoka’s turn to watch her friend run around a store and exclaim  over things. They were in a sporting store that had a rather large  section of Lacrosse gear and Nagisa was going nuts over it,  explaining everything to her friend as she picked it up. Honoka went  along with it, despite having secretly gotten a book about the basics  of lacrosse so she would know more about what her friend liked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I assist you  with anything ladies?” A clerk asked them politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually yes,”  Nagisa put down the lacrosse racquet and smiled at him. “My friend  is joining an archery club at school; do you have anything for  beginners?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything in  specific?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” Honoka  reached in her purse and pulled out a slip of paper. “Our friend  will come back with us later to pick out a bow, but I need some  standard stuff to get out of the way…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Heeeeey! Hikari!”  Nagisa waved at her friend. “How was your day?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really fun,” She  replied happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa-sempai,  look!” Nao held up a sheet of paper, which the older girl took. “We  played laser tag and I came in first place!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Way to go!” She  grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We got most of your  stuff already, Hikari-san,” Honoka offered the girl a bag. “We  need to go back and get you a bow and wrist brace, but other than  that, you’re set to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you didn’t  have to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We wanted to,”  Nagisa replied easily. “So you can have more fun with your  friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“….Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You guys go ahead to  the sports store; I just remembered Ryouta wanted something here  too!” Nagisa waved at them and ran off before anyone could reply.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Oh man, we’re  totally late!” Nagisa whined as she looked at her wristwatch.  “Mom’s going to yell at me…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t have to  treat us to dinner,” Honoka took her hand, watching the buildings  rush by them through the train window.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve never had a  nice meal together before, just the three of us. I wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But aren’t you low  on money?” Hikari asked lightly, looking up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t’ worry  about it; I got lots of tips from working the other day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can stay at my  house if you’d like, Nagisa.” Honoka smiled at her. “Hikari is  staying too, it’ll be fun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All right! Slumber  party!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But don’t forget  the math test tomorrow. We’re going to have to study.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sandy blonde’s  face fell. “Yes mam…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Honoka rubbed her eyes  lightly, trying to focus on the pages below her. “What’s wrong?”  Nagisa asked lightly, looking over at her. “You’ve been rubbing  your eyes a lot lately.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its nothing,” The  girl pushed up from the floor and walked over to her desk to open a  drawer. Taking out a small black case, she clicked it open and picked  up her glasses. She put them on and looked over at Nagisa, who was  looking at her interestedly. “…What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t see you  often with your glasses on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” She walked  over to stand beside the laying girl and looked out the crack in the  door to check up on Porun and the rest playing outside. “I don’t  like wearing them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why’s that?”  Nagisa put her hands under her chin and tried to balance her pencil  on her nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because,”  Honoka looked down at her friend lying on her stomach and placed her  foot on the small of her back and gently applied pressure as she  moved it. The move worked like she thought it would and Nagisa laid  her head down on her arms, purring out in appreciation. “Like  that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm…” The girl  closed her eyes and sighed contently. “You know just where to rub…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think so?” Honoka  kneeled down and gently started to massage the girl’s back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re going to  spoil me,” She spoke lazily, smiling. “And you’ll regret it  when I ask for this after lacrosse practice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll rub your back  anytime you want,” Honoka giggled. “All you got to do is ask.”  Nagisa rolled over suddenly and reached up to catch her hands. “What  is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blond girl smiled  and reached under the bed to pull out a small bag. She used one hand  to get something out of it while using her other to hold onto  Honoka’s hands. “Here, I got this for you,” She pulled out the  silver bracelet that Honoka had been looking at earlier, complete  with a little heart trinket attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Awwww, I wanted this  so much! Thank you!” The girl fell forward and hugged her friend  happily. “I’ll always wear it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hehe, I’m glad you  like it.” Nagisa hugged her back and smiled when they looked at  each other. After a moment, the girl moved her hand up behind  Honoka’s neck and leaned up to kiss her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not interrupting am  I?” Hikari asked, peeking in the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh uh!” Honoka  quickly pulled away. “Not at all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes you are,”  Nagisa pouted out. “I was so close, too…” Hikari laughed at her  when Honoka leaned forward and pecked Nagisa’s cheek to calm her  down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After another hour of  studying Nagisa yawned out rather loudly. “Okay, that’s it. No  more.” She closed her book to show her determination on quitting  and stretched out. “I just want some sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can go along with  that,” Honoka closed her book as well and started putting them all  in her backpack. “Hikari-san is already ahead of us.” She looked  over at the younger girl who was sleeping on the floor along with  Porun, Mepple, and Mipple.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She had an exciting  day, apparently.” Nagisa smiled to herself, kneeling beside her and  picking up her friends to set them in their own little pet bed Honoka  had bought for them. Walking back over to her, she picked up the girl  as Honoka changed into her nightclothes. “Here you are,” She  whispered, laying her on a futon and covering her up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” She opened  her eyes sleepily. “Nagisa-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go back to sleep,”  Nagisa whispered to her lightly. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay…” Hikari  looked like she didn’t really understand what she was told but  closed her eyes anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After changing into a  baggy shirt, Nagisa clicked off the lights and joined Honoka in bed.  “G’night Honoka.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweet dreams. Thanks  again for the bracelet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing.” She  reached out and took her hand under the covers.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hikari woke up quickly  as a loud crash of thunder roared out. It was immediately followed by  a flash of lightning, illuminating the room for a brief moment.  Suddenly scared, the girl remembered the part of the movie she  watched where the girl was grabbed and drug under the bed. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Calm  down, it was just a movie… just a movie</span></em>…’ Another crack of  thunder invaded her ears and lighting flashed, making a shadow from a  tree outside appear on the door to Honoka’s room. It was enough to  make the girl cry out and scamper out of her futon and over to the  bed. “Nagisa. Nagisa!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha, huh!?” Nagisa  sat up, trying to get her bearings. “Hikari, what is it!? Is  something wrong?” Honoka sat up next to her slowly, having had her  cuddle toy taken from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m scared!” She  cried, hugging the sandy blond and burying her face into her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just a rain  storm…” Nagisa awkwardly hugged the girl back. “There’s  nothing to be scared of. Tell her Honoka.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s right; it’s  just the humidity condensation and saturating the clouds. Lightning  is just electricity from the ions and protons attracting each other  and…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you Honoka,  I’m going to have science nightmares now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S…Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s, that.”  Nagisa told the shivering girl. “Rain can’t hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m scared Freddy  will get me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fre….You watched  that movie didn’t you!?” Nagisa’s voice was clearly upset.  “After we told you not to!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry!”  Hikari cried out, hugging her tighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou, I should make  you sleep on the floor with your feet under the bed just so you’ll  learn your lesson.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, don’t!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl turned to look  at Honoka and stuck out her tongue. “Like I’d actually do that.”   Turning back to her younger friend, Nagisa put her hand on her head.  “Don’t worry, Hikari. We won’t let anything hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Promise?” She  pulled back a little and looked up at her, sniffing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise,” Honoka  confirmed, reaching out her hand. “Come on, get in bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari nodded lightly,  letting go of Nagisa and crawling over to Honoka. Sliding under the  covers, she got a hug from the girl and felt Nagisa wrap an arm over  her waist and rest her hand on Honoka’s hip. “We’re here, so  just relax and get some sleep.” Nagisa yawned out and slid her  other hand under the pillow, where she brushed up against Honoka’s.  Looking at the girl, she smiled and loosely gripped her thumb.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay… good night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweet dreams,” the  older girls said at the same time.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“And that’s my  parents,” A girl finished up, bowing lightly. Her and her two  parents smiled at the small group of people in front of them and  walked with their daughter. The group of people clapped politely and  the teacher walked to the front of the crowd again.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They were on the track  field, a little off to the side where a new range of bow targets had  been set up. Several arrows were lined against the wall where the  students would stand and aim for their target. Currently they were  introducing each student and their parents to the rest of the  after-school class so the teacher could meet everyone. “Well, that  only leaves… Hikari-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari stood up and  walked to the front of the crowd alone. When she got there she turned  around and bowed lightly. “I don’t have parents, so to say,”  She began, trying to choose her words. “I never really gave it much  thought until recently. Although I don’t have a mother or a father,  I have people close to me that fill those roles. They protect me,”  An image of Cure White and Cure Black standing in front of her came  to mind. “Look after my well being,” Hikari thought of Nagisa  putting a jacket around her and Honoka telling her not to watch the  movie she wanted to.  “…And scold me when I do something I  shouldn’t.” Her mind reflected to the previous night where Nagisa  got angry at her. “I know they aren’t much older than myself, but  without them I would really be lost and alone… They may not be my  real parents but I love them just the same,” Hikari remembered  Nagisa’s father placing his hand on her head, then Nagisa doing the  same to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking by the group,  she saw her two older friends walking over to her, Aprently having  their clubs just finish and coming to check up on her. “So here  they are,” She waved over to them. “Nagisa-san! Honoka-san! Come  here please!” The two girls blinked and looked at each other before  walking over to the blond. “Everyone, this is Yukishiro Honoka-san,  my ‘mother’, and Misumi Nagisa-san, my ‘father’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, why am I the  father?” Nagisa whispered, shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice to meet you,”  Honoka bowed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh, um, likewise,”  Nagisa bowed awkwardly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The group clapped for  her, a little louder than for the rest of the group. Hikari lead them  back to her spot, where they sat down next to her. “My little  family,” Hikari spoke softly so only they could hear. “A mother,”  She looked at Honoka and got a hug. “And a ‘father’.” She  looked over at Nagisa, who put her hand on her head, ruffling her  hair slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa moved her eyes  to Honoka, who met them. The two shared a small moment, being proud  of their newfound ‘daughter’ and both put their arms around her.</span></p>
