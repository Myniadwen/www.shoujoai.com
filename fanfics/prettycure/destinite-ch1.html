<h1>Destined Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../prettycure/index.html">Pretty Cure</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/satashi.html">Satashi</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Running past my friends, I took a deep breath and prepared for my 
favorite goal shot. The last person was avoided and I leapt to the air, 
letting out a sharp yell as I slung my racket. The hard ball swerved to the 
side and cracked the ground, making it ricochet up and between the 
goalie&#39;s legs. The net gave way and the ball continued through and to the 
bottom of the stands. Our couch blew the whistle and I couldn&#39;t help but 
grin to myself. As far as I knew, I was the only one who has ever done 
that. 



&quot;I got it!&quot; Nagisa called out as she ran to the stands to pick up the 
ball. Scooping it up into her racket she looked up at the conversation 
taking place a few steps above her.

&quot;No, really, I...&quot; Honoka took a step backwards and waved her hands 
shyly at the guys in front of her.

&quot;Come on Honoka, the dance is only a few nights away, we need to know!&quot; 
One of them protested as the others beside him took a step forward.

&quot;Will you go with one of us or not!?&quot; another added in, getting nods 
from the small group of five.

The look on Honoka&#39;s face made Nagisa bite her lip in frustration. Her 
best friend had been pestered for the last week now by guys asking her 
to the upcoming school dance. Seems like now they were finally pressing 
for an answer. &quot;Hey, leave her alone!&quot; Nagisa called out to them, 
annoyed. &quot;Can&#39;t you see that you&#39;re intimidating her?!&quot;

&quot;Nagisa...&quot; Honoka looked at her thankfully.

&quot;Then who&#39;s she going to go with?&quot; A third boy from the crowd asked the 
sandy blonde girl.

&quot;We won&#39;t give up until she goes with one of us!&quot;

Having heard enough, Nagisa gripped her racket and yelled up at them. 
&quot;She&#39;s going with me, so leave her alone already!&quot; The silence that 
followed shocked her, making her turn around and look at the people 
suddenly giving her all their attention. &#39;I didn&#39;t yell that loud did I?&#39; Her 
mind asked herself. Swallowing, she looked over at Honoka who seemed 
just as shocked as the rest.

&quot;Shoulda known...&quot; The group muttered to themselves as they turned and 
started walking away.

When they were a reasonable amount away, Honoka hopped down the steps 
and over to her friend. &quot;Nagisa, what?&quot;

&quot;Eh, I&#39;m sorry...&quot; The girl looked down, embarrassed as the noise 
around them started to pick up again now that the ordeal was over. &quot;I... 
didn&#39;t know what else to say to make them leave you alone.&quot;

&quot;Oh... Oh, I see.&quot; Honoka took a few steps back and turned around. 
&quot;Thanks for the help, then.&quot; She moved up the stands and looked back over 
her shoulder. &quot;But for a moment there... I was happy to hear that.&quot;

A blush shot across the Lacrosse player&#39;s face while she watched her 
partner run up the stands and over to the school buildings. &#39;Well that 
sucks...&#39; She thought to herself as she walked slowly back over to her 
team and ignored the questions about her &#39;date&#39; to the dance. The 
remainder of her practice went by without her really noticing and before long 
she found herself waiting at the gates of her school. A few people 
looked over at her and whispered to their walking partners who then looked 
shocked while grinning at her.

Looking to the ground, Nagisa tried to fight back another blush. Word 
got around fast apparently, and she had gotten a few looks as the day 
went on. Finally, after waiting almost fifteen minutes, she saw Honoka 
walk past the school gates and turn to look at her. &quot;Hey,&quot; she greeted 
casually as she walked over to the other girl. &quot;Waiting?&quot;

&quot;For you,&quot; Nagisa replied uneasy. &quot;Um, Meppo wanted to see Mipple!&quot; She 
quickly took out her pouch and opened it up, revealing a sleeping 
Meppo. &quot;Eh,&quot; The blush finally came to her face while she tried to think of 
what to say.

&quot;Want to walk home together?&quot; Honoka asked as she went by, taking her 
hand as she did. Nagisa allowed herself to be pulled along without any 
protest. Holding hands was nothing new for the girls, but after Nagisa&#39;s 
outbreak today it got them several more looks and whispers. &quot;It seems 
we&#39;re popular today, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I haven&#39;t had a quiet moment since practice... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For saying that so suddenly. If someone is taking you to the dance, I 
probably ruined it for you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have a date,&quot; Honoka replied easily, looking over at her. 

&quot;I don&#39;t either...&quot; Nagisa swallowed suddenly. &quot;Hey, since you don&#39;t 
and I don&#39;t, would you want to...you know?&quot;

&quot;Go together?&quot; Honoka stopped at the entrance to Nagisa&#39;s apartment 
complex and smiled at her. 

&quot;Yeah, would you want to go with me?&quot; Her free hand went to scratch the 
back of her neck

The bluish-purple haired girl let go of Nagisa&#39;s hand and nodded as she 
walked away from her backwards. &quot;Sure. Half the school already thinks 
we are anyway.&quot; She giggled lightly and waved. &quot;Together it is.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, together.&quot;  Nagisa returned her grin with a shy one of her own. 
When her friend was out of sight she finally allowed herself to panic. 
&quot;Oh my god, what am I going to wear!?&quot; The girl hurried up to her 
apartment and unlocked the door. &quot;Mom! Hey Mom are you home?&quot;

&quot;My, aren&#39;t we perky today?&quot; Her mother asked as she walked by with a 
hamper of dirty cloths. 

&quot;Mom, I need a favor.&quot; Nagisa followed her, picking up whatever fell 
out of the basket. 

&quot;You can&#39;t have an advance on your allowance.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that!&quot; She protested, annoyed. &quot;I need.... well; it kind of 
is like that... I need a dress!&quot;

&quot;A dress?&quot; Her mother turned and looked at her. &quot;Since when did you 
ever want to be in a dress?&quot;

&quot;Eh... Well, there&#39;s this... dance... at school, and...&quot;

Her mother laughed lightly and set the hamper down. &quot;Okay, okay, I 
suppose I can buy you a dress for that.&quot;

&quot;Really?!&quot; Nagisa hugged her mother tightly. &quot;Thank you! We need to go 
now, the dance is this Friday!&quot;

&quot;They waited this long to ask you?&quot; Her mother shook her head and put 
her hand on her hip.

&quot;Actually... I kind of asked.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Who is it, that soccer player?&quot; She walked past her daughter and 
picked up her purse. 

&quot;No, I&#39;m just going with a friend.&quot; Nagisa put a hand on her pouch when 
she felt Mepple start to wake up. &quot;I need to get something from my 
room; I&#39;ll be right back okay?&quot; Without waiting for an answer she ran off 
and closed the door behind her.

&quot;I want to see Mipple!&quot; Mepple proclaimed to her the moment she got in 
her room. 

&quot;Not right now! I&#39;m very busy!&quot;

&quot;You look freaked out,&quot; The small cell-phone like creature told her as 
if he were stating the weather. &quot;You should go talk to Honoka about 
it!&quot;

&quot;Nice try,&quot; Nagisa glared at her friend. &quot;Look, between now and Friday 
I won&#39;t be around Honoka besides at school.&quot;

&quot;Why!?&quot;

&quot;Because I have to get ready for my date!&quot;

&quot;You have a date!? With who!?&quot;

&quot;With Honoka!&quot; Nagisa replied angrily. No sooner than the words escaped 
her mouth did she clamp a hand over it.

If the Hero thought anything of the two girls dating he didn&#39;t show it. 
Instead his eyes began to water. &quot;So I can&#39;t see Mipple?&quot;

Sighing, Nagisa slid the food card across the phone like device. &quot;Drown 
your woes in some ice cream, I need to go shopping. No talking for a 
bit, okay?&quot;

&quot;Ice cream!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, okay.&quot;

							~**~

&quot;What will your date be wearing?&quot; Nagisa&#39;s mother asked as they looked 
at the semi-formal dresses in the shop. 

The girl being questioned looked nervously at the cloths around her. 
&quot;Probably white and blue,&quot; She thought aloud. Picking up a red dress, she 
held it up to herself and looked in a mirror. &quot;... Nothing mature ever 
looks good on me...&quot;

&quot;You just have to find something that you like,&quot; Her mother took the 
dress and held another one in front of her. &quot;If he&#39;s going to be wearing 
light colors then you should wear something dark.&quot;

&quot;Black and pink?&quot; She thought to her Pretty Cure outfit. Although it 
was a little to revealing for a dance, she had to admit that she did like 
the colors on it. 

&quot;Try this one on.&quot; Nagisa took the offered dress from her mother and 
looked it over. A black form fitting Chinese style dress with light pink 
highlights around the hem. A long slit ran up the leg to give freedom 
of movement. 

&quot;I need shoes too...&quot; Nagisa&#39;s mind realized as she looked at the 
outfit. &quot;...and a purse.&quot;

						~**~

The night of the dance came by fast and before she knew it, Nagisa was 
sitting at the vanity in her room nervously letting her mother apply 
makeup on her face. &quot;Not too much,&quot; She spoke suddenly.

&quot;Relax already,&quot; Her mother scolded her. &quot;You&#39;ve said that a hundred 
times, I know what I&#39;m doing. Hold still, for the last time!&quot; She ran 
some eyeliner across her daughter&#39;s eyes and leaned back to observe her 
work. She had managed to apply the eyeliner, a little blush and lip gloss 
to her daughter, as well as paint the fingernails that had to be 
manicured since she had a habit of biting them. &quot;How are you getting to the 
dance?&quot; 

&quot;A friend&#39;s sister is also going, so she&#39;s giving us a ride to and 
from.&quot; Nagisa looked in the mirror and couldn&#39;t help but smile a little. 
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t look half bad.&quot;

&quot;See? I told you.&quot; Her mother stood up. &quot;Now finish getting ready, I&#39;ll 
be in the living room.&quot; She went to leave, only pausing to peck her 
husband on the cheek as she left.

&quot;Hey Dad,&quot; Nagisa greeted as she put in her earrings. &quot;Do I look okay?&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; He replied with a grin, walking over to her. &quot;I got you 
something.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Nagisa blinked and looked at the clear plastic box he 
held in his hand. Inside was a pink rose with dark green trimmings around 
it. &quot;A band corsage? But Dad...&quot;

&quot;I know, the guy normally gives it to the girl, but I thought you&#39;d 
want it anyway.&quot; He sat on her vanity. &quot;Just incase. You know,&quot; His 
daughter&#39;s face suddenly flushed when she realized that he knew her date was 
another girl. &quot;Don&#39;t worry pumpkin,&quot; He gently patted her head and 
smiled down at her. &quot;You&#39;re my little girl, always.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not like that!&quot; She protested, standing. &quot;We&#39;re just friends!&quot; 
She took the small container anyway and brushed past him on her way to 
the door. Pausing just a moment, she looked down at it. &quot;...Thanks, Dad.&quot;

As if on cue the doorbell rang, getting Nagisa&#39;s little brother&#39;s 
attention. &quot;Sister&#39;s date is here!&quot; he proclaimed excitedly and ran to the 
door despite the protest. When the door was open, the little boy greeted 
the person with a loud &quot;Hello!&quot; but then paused in his tracks. 
&quot;Honoka!&quot; 

&quot;Hello, Ryouta.&quot; Honoka smiled down at him. &quot;Is Nagisa ready?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Her friend answered as she leaned against the wall to pull 
her shoes on. She had decided to go with the Chinese dress as well as 
some black high heel shoes. At her side hung a dark pink purse and 
matching earrings graced her ears. &quot;Wow,&quot; The girl breathed after finally 
getting a good look at Honoka. &quot;You look... great!&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, as do you.&quot; Honoka looked down at her elegant white dress. 
It clung closely to her body down to her waist where it flared out 
dramatically. A large light blue bow was on her back. Her shoes were 
matching white with blue trim, although not heels like her counter part had. 
She offered her gloved hand to her friend, who took it. The gloves were 
fingerless and went a little past her elbow where they flared with blue 
trim as well.

&quot;Sister&#39;s dating Honoka?&quot; Ryouta asked, shocked. Turning, he ran back 
into the living room. &quot;Mom! Nagisa&#39;s dating a girl!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; the blond said embarrassedly while using her free hand to 
wave to her father as she left.  The pair walked to the elevator and 
after pressing the button to go down, Nagisa&#39;s hand bumped her purse. 
&quot;Um...I have something for you,&quot; She spoke shyly as they boarded. 

&quot;Oh?&quot; The blue haired girl blinked and looked over at her.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nagisa unzipped her purse and shifted Meppo to the side and 
retrieved the small plastic box. &quot;I know it&#39;s normally from a guy, but I 
know you&#39;d want one, so...&quot; Her eyes shyly looked down into her friend&#39;s 
and in the moment Nagisa noticed that with her heels on, along with her 
natural height advantage on the girl, Honoka barely came to her 
shoulder.

Seeing the flower bracelet, Honoka smiled happily. &quot;Thank you! I did 
want one, really badly.&quot; She offered her hand to her friend and felt her 
cheeks burn just a little as Nagisa awkwardly slid it over her small 
wrist. &quot;I have one for you too, actually.&quot; When her hand was free again, 
she reached into her white purse and pulled out a small box as well. 
&quot;But I know you don&#39;t like wearing bracelets so I got the clip kind.&quot; The 
box opened to reveal a white rose with blue flecked tips. &quot;Do you want 
it?&quot;

&quot;I always wanted to wear one of these actually...&quot; Nagisa allowed her 
friend to clip the pin across her left breast. &quot;I guess we match now, 
huh?&quot; She looked down at the flower in appreciation. 

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s like we&#39;re a couple.&quot;

The word instantly made both girls look away from each other shyly. Any 
further embarrassment was saved by their friends greeting them at the 
bottom of the apartment complex.

						~**~

&quot;Wow, everything looks so different.&quot; Honoka looked around the school 
auditorium in appreciation. &quot;It&#39;s almost like a different place all 
together.&quot;

&quot;I still think they could have at least rented out somewhere for the 
dance,&quot; Nagisa complained half heartedly. &quot;Will everyone really fit in 
here at the same time?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; we should have plenty of room.&quot; Kyoko waved the notion 
off. &quot;Natsuko said that even with the tables and stuff, we&#39;ll still have 
plenty of room to dance.&quot;

&quot;Ack!&quot;

Honoka turned to her date, who seemed suddenly stiff. &quot;Nagisa? What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

Slowly, the girl turned to her friend. &quot;I just remembered...&quot;

&quot;Remembered what?&quot;

&quot;Nagisa can&#39;t dance-mepo!&quot;  Mepple&#39;s voice suddenly came form Nagisa&#39;s 
purse, making a few people turn and look at her. 

&quot;Shhhh!&quot; Nagisa hissed to her friend while Honoka laughed nervously. &quot;I 
can dance just fine... just not slow.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Honoka put her hand on Nagisa&#39;s shoulder to cheer her 
up. &quot;I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t slow dance much anyway, and I heard from Fujipi 
that none of his friends knew how to either.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Fujipi can&#39;t slow dance either?!&quot;

&quot;I can, actually,&quot; a voice from behind scared Nagisa enough to scamper 
away and get behind Honoka. &quot;Ah, did I scare you? Sorry, sorry.&quot;

&quot;Good evening, Fujipi.&quot; Honoka smiled at her childhood friend. &quot;Where&#39;s 
your date?&quot; He was dressed up in a nice black tuxedo but didn&#39;t seem to 
have a flower pinned on his chest.

&quot;Over there.&quot; He pointed to his soccer buddies, who were all laughing 
by the refreshments. &quot;We all came as a group. Turns out none of them had 
the guts to ask a girl.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re dateless too?&quot; Nagisa moved from behind her friend and tried to 
save some of her embarrassment. 

&quot;There was a raffle of who I would invite, so I just didn&#39;t invite 
anyone.&quot; He laughed uneasily. &quot;How about you two? Where are your dates?&quot; 
His eyes swept to each girl&#39;s corsage. &quot;Ohhhh, together I see? Anyway, 
save a dance for me okay Honoka?&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot; The girl smiled.

&quot;You too, Nagisa.&quot; He waved lightly before walking over to his friends 
and then on the dance floor as an upbeat song started to play and 
finally start the dance. 

&quot;That shocked me,&quot; Nagisa sighed and held a hand to her heart. &quot;Mou, 
why does everyone have to point out that we came together?&quot;

&quot;There there,&quot; Honoka took her hand and lead the girl over to the table 
with the beverages. &quot;Have some punch and relax a little.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; She took a long drink and just barely had enough time to 
set the cup down before Shiho ran by and grabbed both their arms. 
&quot;Wha!?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s dance, let&#39;s dance, let&#39;s dance!&quot; The hyper girl cheered 
happily. Before either could protest they were already in the middle of the 
floor.

&quot;I can do this at least,&quot; Nagisa moved in between the crowd and let 
herself go to the music, glad to have something she knew on her mind 
rather than worrying about what she didn&#39;t. 

The first song faded seamlessly into the second and before long a third 
played as well. The newest song was one that knew pretty well and 
laughed as her friends danced with their dates, grinding their bodies 
together despite being in semi to full formal gowns and dresses. Her eyes 
scanned the area to find Honoka and after a moment, spotted her dancing 
alongside of one of the science club members. 

A sudden impulse took control of the girl and she moved through the 
crowd and wrapped an arm around Honoka&#39;s stomach, making her squeak in 
surprise. Turning to look at who just grabbed her, she saw Nagisa&#39;s 
playful face stick her tongue out. The next moment she felt her dance behind 
her much like a guy would. &quot;Mou, you!&quot; She complained embarrassedly 
before slowly starting to dance with her, moving her back against Nagisa&#39;s 
front.

&quot;Whew whew!&quot; Someone cheered at them, but it was lost as soon as Honoka 
realized how funny they must look. Laughing herself, she put her hands 
on Nagisa&#39;s and danced with her fully. 

&quot;Since when did you know how to dance like that?&quot; Nagisa laughed into 
her ear.

&quot;From all the MTV you make me watch when I come over,&quot; She replied 
happily. &quot;For once I&#39;m glad you&#39;re such a bad influence on me!&quot;

&quot;Hey now!&quot; Nagisa twirled her a moment before bringing Honoka back to 
her front, where she moved her body closely against hers. &quot;Shake that 
money maker!&quot;

&quot;Nagisa!&quot; Honoka felt her cheeks color, but laughed despite herself. 
The song faded out and was instantly replaced by a slower one. The lights 
dimmed a little and before they knew it, several small lights were 
circling the floor, only illuminating enough to allow people to see where 
they were dancing. The couples changed from goof off to serious almost 
instantly and pulled their dates close to slow dance with.

&quot;Um,&quot; Nagisa looked at Honoka as she pulled away and turned to face 
her. 

&quot;Nagisa lets dance!&quot; Hasekura&#39;s voice suddenly invaded her ears and 
before she could react, was swept up by the goofy red-head. &quot;You don&#39;t 
have a date right?&quot;

&quot;Actually...&quot; She turned to look at Honoka, who was being asked by 
Fujimaru. Seeing no help there, she turned back to the boy. &quot;No guy, no.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; His hands went to her waist and swayed to the side, making her 
reach up to put her hands on his shoulders. &quot;I suck at dancing, 
though.&quot;

&quot;So do I, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Nagisa grinned to herself. If it was anyone 
that she could pick to have to dance with first to get over the 
awkwardness of it, it would have to be this guy. The goofball that chased after 
Cure Black, even though pushy, was sort of kind of a friend of hers. &quot;So 
no one would go with you huh?&quot; She teased him as the pair awkwardly 
moved on the dance floor. 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t find my dream girl,&quot; he sighed and spun Nagisa around just 
for the fun of it. &quot;I can never seem to get more than just a fleeting 
glimpse of her.&quot; Hasekura moved along with her a little more easily. &quot;No 
one would go with you either? Ouch!&quot; He looked down at the girl, trying 
to decide if her stepping on his foot was intentional or not.

Smirking up at him, Nagisa answered evasively. &quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; She 
turned along with him, watching others dance to try and get a better 
idea of how to do it properly. &quot;At least my date isn&#39;t a group of guys. 
Ow!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sorry.&quot; Hasekura closed one eye in apology. &quot;I told you I suck 
at slow dancing.&quot;

The pair laughed at each other a moment before grinning. The song ended 
after a moment and they both smiled. It had to be by far the worst 
dance either of them ever had, but at least now they were both over the 
initial embarrassment of slow dancing with someone. 

&quot;My turn!&quot; Another boy announced, taking Nagisa&#39;s hand and sweeping 
into a bow. Sure enough, another slow song started playing and Honoka was 
also grabbed by another member of the soccer team. 

Nagisa accepted the dance and made it all the way through without any 
embarrassment, even coming out a little better dancer from it. 
Thankfully the next song picked up the beat and the lights flashed back on 
fully, swirling the dance floor with different colors. Recognizing the song, 
Nagisa smiled to herself and found her friends.

Honoka watched happily as the Lacrosse team did their own little dance. 
&quot;They look like they&#39;re having fun.&quot;

&quot;Sure do.&quot; The voice of Fujimaru made the girl jump a little. &quot;Scared 
two girls in one night, I&#39;m on a roll.&quot; He offered her a cup of punch, 
which she took. &quot;You may not want to drink anymore after this cup; the 
guys are spiking it right now.&quot;

Honoka looked behind the soccer leader and gasped at the group of boys 
pouring a clear liquid into the large punch bowl. &quot;Oh my... I should 
stop them.&quot; Her movement to go by him was cut short when an arm went out 
to stop her.

&quot;Aw come on, let them have some fun.&quot; Fujimaru smiled down at her.

&quot;Mou, you always were a troublemaker behind the scenes.&quot; Honoka grinned 
despite herself and turned to watch the girls dancing. &quot;Doesn&#39;t really 
seem like a formal dance does it?&quot;

&quot;No matter what, we&#39;re only high school students.&quot; He chuckled to 
himself. &quot;We can dress as nice as we want, but we&#39;ll still act like children 
given the chance.&quot;

&quot;I suppose that&#39;s true.&quot; Honoka sipped her punch slowly, waiting for 
the song to be over before reclaiming her date. She didn&#39;t have to wait 
long before the music changed, but was pulled to the dance floor by her 
childhood friend. 

Nagisa took the opportunity to get beside her friend during the vocal 
order dance. The song told them to take two steps to the right, then one 
back before hopping forward. Laughing, the large mass of people did as 
they were told before the song faded and another one picked up. 

Time flew by fast and before Nagisa knew it, the third set of slow 
songs started to be played. Walking quickly to tables, she sat down before 
anyone could ask her to dance again. &quot;It&#39;s hot...&quot; She complained to no 
one in particular. 

Honoka came to her a moment later and smiled. &quot;Resting?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I haven&#39;t had a moment alone since the first song.&quot; She took a 
large breath and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m most definitely sitting these out. 
Actually, I could use a drink.&quot;

&quot;The guys spiked the punch,&quot; Honoka sat down beside her friend at the 
table. &quot;I don&#39;t recommend drinking it.&quot; Reaching over, she picked up a 
glass and offered it to her friend. &quot;Here, I filled it up with water 
last song.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nagisa took it and gulped it down quickly. &quot;Man that really 
hits the spot.&quot; A few moments went by in idle chat before they were both 
interrupted by Fujimaru, who requested a dance from Nagisa. &quot;Dance? 
With you?&quot; She swallowed thickly.

&quot;Come on,&quot; He pulled her up and led her out to the dance floor. Placing 
his hands on her waist, he moved to the music after letting her get 
situated herself. &quot;Enjoying the dance so far?&quot; He asked after a moment. 

&quot;I think so,&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a blast.&quot; He looked back down at her and judged his next 
few words carefully. &quot;You haven&#39;t danced with Honoka yet have you?&quot;

&quot;Eh!?&quot; her face blushed. &quot;We danced...&quot;

&quot;I meant slow dance.&quot;

&quot;I-I don&#39;t want to embarrass her. I mean, fast dancing for fun is one 
thing, but...&quot;

He grinned lightly. &quot;She wants you to ask her.&quot;

&quot;How can you tell?&quot; Nagisa looked over at the table, where Honoka was 
looking down at her drink, contemplating. After a moment she closed her 
eyes and took a swig of punch, making a face at it after she swallowed.

&quot;I just can. Listen, Nagisa, don&#39;t let other people get to you so much. 
It&#39;s not like you to hesitate.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot; The girl looked down. &quot;But I can barely slow dance as it is, 
I don&#39;t know how to do it in reverse.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s all that&#39;s stopping you, let&#39;s find out.&quot; His hands went to 
his shoulders and plucked hers, placing them on his waist. She next 
found his hands on her shoulders. &quot;You start off, sway to whatever side.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; She looked around, glad that it was too dark for anyone to 
really tell what they were doing. &quot;Just like normal?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re just leading it instead of following.&quot; He felt her move 
and responded to it. &quot;See? Not so hard is it?&quot;

&quot;Actually... no, its not.&quot; She gave him a lame smile. &quot;You don&#39;t think 
she&#39;ll mind dancing with me like this?&quot;

&quot;Not at all. Trust me, I know her best.&quot; The song started to fade away 
and he guided her back over to the table. &quot;Good it&#39;s another slow song 
coming up, go for it.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Nagisa left his embrace and walked over to her date. &quot;Hey,&quot; 
She greeted.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Honoka looked up at her happily, as if waiting.

&quot;Would you want to-?&quot;

&quot;Dance with me?&quot; A boy Nagisa didn&#39;t know offered his hand down at 
Honoka. The blue haired girl blinked a moment before looking over at Nagisa 
then back to the boy. When a few seconds went by, she put on a fake 
smile and stood up.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Nagisa clenched her fist. &quot;Um,&quot; She closed her eyes when the 
two looked at her. Taking a breath, she looked back up and caught 
Fujimaru&#39;s eyes across the room. He gave her a slight nod in return. &quot;She&#39;s 
dancing with me!&quot; the words left her mouth quickly, almost blurring 
together.

&quot;Oh, my bad.&quot; The boy looked embarrassed and walked backwards a bit 
before turning. Honoka looked at her best friend, glad her makeup was 
covering her darkening cheeks.

&quot;Shall we?&quot; Nagisa offered her hand out, which was taken. Together the 
pair walked to the floor next to the other dancing couples. The blond 
put her hands on Honoka&#39;s waist and smiled when she felt Honoka&#39;s on her 
shoulders. A moment passed before Nagisa remembered to lead, and did so 
by moving to the beat of the song. 

&quot;You don&#39;t dance so badly,&quot; Honoka spoke up at her softly. 

&quot;I had someone show me so I could,&quot; She whispered back, making her 
partner giggle lightly. &quot;But if I step on your foot, don&#39;t laugh at me 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Of course not!&quot; Honoka shook her head, as if to show that she really 
wouldn&#39;t. The movement, however, threw off their timing and the pair 
bumped into another dancing couple. The girl in white stumbled a little 
and found herself against Nagisa&#39;s chest. Her partner whispered a quick 
apology to the pair they interrupted.

When Honoka didn&#39;t move back right away, Nagisa allowed her arms to 
slowly wrap around her date&#39;s waist and pull the smaller girl closer. In 
response, she felt Honoka&#39;s arms slide up her body and wrap around her 
neck and shoulders. Her partner&#39;s head rested under her chin and she 
felt Honoka&#39;s eyes flutter closed. The pair slowly started to move again, 
gently dancing to the soothing music. &quot;Your hair smells nice,&quot; Nagisa 
spoke down in a whisper. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Honoka breathed out against Nagisa&#39;s chest. Inhaling the 
scent, she smiled. Nagisa wore perfume maybe once since the two had met 
and that was at the mall when there was a free sample at a store. For 
her to wear some tonight was special. Pulling her closer, Honoka 
snuggled head against Nagisa&#39;s shoulder and under her neck. &#39;I wish I could 
stay like this longer than just a dance,&#39; her mind thought. &#39;I don&#39;t want 
to let go...&#39;

&quot;Honoka...&quot; Nagisa blushed darkly. &quot;Honoka...&quot; She rubbed her partner&#39;s 
back slightly to get attention, and was rewarded with Honoka pulling 
back just enough to look up at her. &quot;I don&#39;t mind at all, but the songs 
been over...&quot;

&quot;Eh!?&quot; Honoka pulled back quickly, getting a few stifled laughs from 
the people around them dancing to an upbeat song. &quot;I...&quot; Looking over at 
her date&#39;s embarrassed face, she took a step back. &quot;I need to get some 
air!&quot; Without waiting for a reply, she turned and hurried over to a 
door and went through it.

&quot;Honoka!&quot; Nagisa&#39;s embarrassment quickly turned into fear. &#39;I shouldn&#39;t 
have pulled her closer...&#39; Her mind yelled at herself as she retraced 
the steps her date just took. &#39;I probably scared her.&#39; The door to the 
outside opened without complaint and a small breeze blew past the girl 
while she made her way over to her friend. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Honoka spoke first without turning around. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t 
have... I mean,&quot; Bringing her arms up, she hugged herself. &quot;But when you 
held me like that I couldn&#39;t stop myself.&quot;

&quot;Honoka...&quot; Nagisa closed the gap between them and put a hand on the 
girl&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have-&quot; She stopped her sentence when the 
shorter girl took a step forward, letting her hand fall. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean 
to scare you.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t scare me,&quot; Honoka sniffled. &quot;I liked it. I liked it too 
much.&quot;

&quot;...You mean?&quot;

Turning, Honoka looked at Nagisa. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to let go.&quot; A tear ran 
down her cheek. &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to move from me... Even if it was 
just a dance, I liked it. I really, really liked it! I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so 
sorry...&quot; Another tear fell. &quot;I don&#39;t want to ruin our friendship but 
after tonight I can&#39;t... I just can&#39;t...&quot; Honoka dissolved into sobs, 
looking down at the ground as her tears fell, unable to say anymore.

&quot;Hey now, look at you...&quot; Nagisa lifted up Honoka&#39;s chin and smiled at 
her. &quot;You&#39;re going to smear your make up.&quot; Using her hand, she dotted 
the girl&#39;s tears as best she could. &quot;Don&#39;t cry, you did nothing wrong.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;I came out here because I thought I scared you, not the other way 
around.&quot; Nagisa put her hands on the girl&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Honoka, I liked it 
too. I always liked it when we were together. Even holding your hand so 
casually, I like it. I like you too, so don&#39;t apologize for that.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s more than that.&quot; Honoka looked up to Nagisa&#39;s eyes and 
blinked back more tears. &quot;I liked it more than in a friendly way! I liked it 
in a romantic way! I-I&quot;

&quot;Me too...&quot;

The girl&#39;s rant was cut off by those two simple words. &quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;Me too. I like you in a romantic way, Honoka.&quot; Nagisa leaned her head 
down and placed their foreheads together. &quot;I like you Honoka. As a 
girl, not just a friend.&quot;

&quot;You mean...?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Nagisa sniffed, smiling happily. &quot;Look, I&#39;m crying now too!&quot; She 
bought her hands up to wipe her eyes. &quot;And I suck at putting on 
makeup!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t rub it!&quot; Honoka took the other girl&#39;s hands before she could 
mess up her makeup more than she already has. The two looked at each other 
a moment before slowly giving each other a hug. &quot;I like you, Nagisa.&quot;

Nodding, Nagisa tightened the hug. &quot;I like you too... Will you be my 
girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Only if you&#39;ll be mine?&quot; Honoka half laughed, half cried her reply.

&quot;Then it&#39;s settled.&quot; Nagisa pulled back and smiled down at her new 
girlfriend. &quot;Pretty Cure, best friends, now girlfriends.&quot;

Honoka hugged the girl again, this time fiercely. Nagisa returned the 
embrace quickly, just as hard. &quot;We still have a date to finish,&quot; She 
spoke after a moment, offering her hand as they pulled apart. &quot;Come on, we 
still have a few more dances before the nights over.&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Honoka took the offered hand and together they went back in the 
main building.

						~**~

&quot;I had a lot of fun tonight,&quot; Honoka told her partner at the door to 
Nagisa&#39;s apartment. 

&quot;Me too. Some first date, huh?&quot; She felt her lips turn up into a smile. 
&quot;I promise the next one will be smoother.&quot;

&quot;It was perfect,&quot; Honoka laughed happily. &quot;Really. I can&#39;t be any 
happier than I am right now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; Nagisa pulled Honoka into another hug. &quot;Tell the girls I 
said thanks for the ride for me?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; She pulled back just a little and looked up at Nagisa. 

Taking a hint, the blond blushed darkly. Ever so slowly she leaned down 
and felt Honoka move up on her toes to meet her in a small kiss. When 
it ended, both girls looked into the other&#39;s eyes and slowly moved to 
kiss again. Letting it last, Nagisa ran her hand down the length of 
Honoka&#39;s hair.

Without warning, the door to the apartment opened up and a young voice 
sprang up. &quot;Sister&#39;s kissing her date!&quot; The two girls froze with their 
eyes wide open, too shocked at the moment to move.

&quot;Ryouta! Don&#39;t spy on your sister, it&#39;s bad...&quot; Nagisa&#39;s mother froze 
in mid sentence.

Ever so slowly the pair let go of each other. &quot;I&#39;ll, um, see you Monday 
at school?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Honoka giggled nervously at being caught in the act and took 
a step backwards. A small moment passed before she turned and quickly 
walked away. &quot;I&#39;ll call!&quot; With that said, the girl ran the rest of the 
way to the elevator, face blushing like fire.

&quot;Bye-bye...&quot; Nagisa waved, still scared to turn and face her family. 
Finally, after delaying as much as she could, Nagisa looked to the door 
of the house. Ryouta was sitting in the floor pointing at her with his 
mouth wide open. Her mother had her hand to her mouth but didn&#39;t seem to 
mind it other than being in shock.

&quot;Have a good date, pumpkin?&quot; Her father asked as he looked around the 
corner.

Taking the opportunity, Nagisa kicked off her heels and closed the 
door, running over to him. &quot;Yeah! It was the best!&quot;

&quot;Tell me all about it!&quot; The two walked away from the entrance to their 
house, where the other two members of the family were still stunned.</pre>
