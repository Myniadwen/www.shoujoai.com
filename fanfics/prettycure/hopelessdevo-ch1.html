<h1>Hopelessly Devoted to you</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../prettycure/index.html">Pretty Cure</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/greatdane.html">The Great Dane</a><br> </h2>
<pre>*** In the start I didn&#39;t feel anything special. I didn&#39;t really think of her in that way. 
It was exiting to get Pretty Cure into my life and to share it with at completely different 
person, but I never would have guessed that I ever would feel this way for her &acirc;&#128;&#147; for a girl 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; It is not that it bugs me that she is a girl, but I just always have dreamt about a prince 
on a white horse. Maybe she is my prince? I have yet to discover what she feels before I 
act. I don&#39;t want to lose my dearest friend just because I am in love with her. In the start 
I wasn&#39;t sure how to describe it, it was a new feeling to me. It was thrilling, scary and 
warm, of a sort. It was like tasting a new flavor of ice-cream and be happily surprised.

Honoka was watching the sunrise early in the morning. Nagisa would be home today, Honoka 
looked forward to it. Nagisa had been on a camp with her lacrosse team for two weeks, and 
Honoka had planned to go to the airport to say welcome home. ***

*** On the other side of the world, more specifically in Denmark, Europe, Nagisa was 
watching the sun go down. She wondered what Honoka was doing right now? In these past two 
weeks Nagisas feelings towards Honoka had grow more than her skills on the pitch, yet she 
was a bit confused. This camp had been fun, as expected they weren&#39;t really challenged in 
any way on the pitch. Denmark was not a big country on Lacrosse, but it was one of the 
cheaper places with the best quality of teams and equipment they could find. They had all 
worked hard on the raising of the funds for this trip. They all worked part time in the 
school to earn its support. Honoka helped too, she pinpointed all the positive aspects of a 
trip to another &quot;world.&quot; The experience would do us good, and harden us psychically as well 
as we would evolve our skills. In the end she got a sponsor for us, which made it possible 
to accomplish the goal.

What did she feel..? Honoka..? Nagisa was unsure how she felt herself. She had never thought 
about these kind of feelings towards females, especially not a &#39;lady&#39; like Honoka, but the 
past few weeks she had just discovered that she was feeling different towards her. Warm, 
unsure, a stuffed-animal-like-feeling. She heard the speaker; they were calling their flight 
ready for takeoff. She couldn&#39;t wait to get home to Honoka. ***

 

What is love?

Is love even describable?

Some say it&#39;s a warm feeling.

Others say that they never feel it.

But one thing is for sure, anyone knows when they are in love.

Does this mean that love is a individual feeling?

Love is like a person, always different.

And always indescribable.

But always true.

*** Honoka looked up, she couldn&#39;t concentrate on reading. This had never happened before. 
She was too distracted, too worried. What did she even read? All she could think about was 
her... Nagisa... She was sure. Indeed sure. She loved Nagisa, but yet... She had never felt 
this kind of love before, how could she be sure that it is real?

Honokas grandmother had just finished the tea. She looked up as Honoka entered the room.

&quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;

Honoka was a little red, she wasn&#39;t sure if she was able to hide that it was a homosexual 
matter.

&quot;Yes dear, you can ask me anything.&quot;

&quot;When do I know if I really love someone?&quot;

Her grandmother had been prepared for that question for some time, but was still a little 
surprised that it arrived now, while Nagisa wasn&#39;t even around &acirc;&#128;&#147; yes she knew.

&quot;Well honey, I can&#39;t explain it to you.&quot;

&quot;Why not? Didn&#39;t you fall in love with grandpa?&quot;

&quot;I did, but the reason why I can&#39;t explain it is simple: Love is like the person you would 
love, a different feeling, I felt like I wanted your grandfather to stay with me forever, 
protect me, guide me and support me, and he felt the same way about me. You will know in 
your heart when you have someone really dear to you. You&#39;ll know when it comes.&quot;

Honoka lightened up, she was sure what she felt now! But still&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; Did Nagisa feel the same way 
about her?

&quot;You will first know her feelings for you the moment she either ask, or answer you. If 
she&#39;s not up for asking, then you&#39;ll have to.&quot;

Honoka looked at her grandmother. She knew? She knew that it was Nagisa she talked about. 
Actually, it didn&#39;t surprise her. ***

*** Nagisa looked down at the skies, they were all white. Just like Cure White, Honoka. She 
watched them flow away under the plane. Would Cure White also flow away from her? If she 
asked for her to be hers? She was sitting aside two young men who seemed to be overjoyed. 
She looked at them; they both had very smooth skin, and blond hair. She could tell from 
their talking that they were talking Danish, well the guy in the blue shirt was talking 
weirder that the other.

&quot;Excuse me may I ask you something?&quot;

The two of them looked at her. Her English wasn&#39;t good, but they seemed to understand her.

&quot;Yes gorgeous, what do you want?&quot;

They seemed friendly.

&quot;Are you celebrating something special, and why are you talking weird Danish?&quot;

They looked at her and smiled at each other.

&quot;Well, for my behalf, I am not talking weird Danish, I am talking Swedish.&quot;

&quot;Oh okay, but what are you celebrating?&quot;

&quot;Our marriage, we just got married a few hours ago in Copenhagen and now we are going to 
Japan for our honeymoon!&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot;

Nagisa looked exited at them.

&quot;Does that mean that I can marry the girl I like too?&quot;

&quot;Haha, well I don&#39;t know the laws of Japan and you look to be pretty young, but if she 
agrees, I can&#39;t see why not!&quot;

Nagisa was exited; maybe, just maybe, she would be able to get Honoka as her girlfriend and 
marry her and have kids with her&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; Well maybe not the last part, but surely they would be 
married. She was determined that she wouldn&#39;t let go of Honoka now! ***

*** Honoka was standing in the airport, she was with Nagisas family, and they were all eager 
to see Nagisa again. Honoka had bought a bucket of flowers; she wanted to give them to 
Nagisa, that would be a good opening!  ***

 

*** Nagisa woke up when she heard the captain tell them that they were about to land in 
Tokyo. She smiled and looked down on the familiar places; the gay couple was really excited. 
When they landed they all went into the welcoming hall. Nagisa got her bag and walked to the 
hallway. She noticed two of the officers of the airport approaching her. The older one of 
them smiled to her.

&quot;Please Mr. can we inspect your bag?&quot;

Nagisa got red as fire and yelled at both of them.

&quot;No you cannot, besides I&#39;m no &#39;Mr.&#39; I am a miss!&quot;

The two officers was shocked, but noticed that she actually was a girl.

&quot;It&#39;s true Hyoka, she&#39;s got boobs.&quot;

Nagisa angered more was just about to hit them as a voice was heard behind her.

&quot;There you are sweetie why are you so upset?&quot;

&quot;Mom? Uhm hi, since when were you here?&quot;

&quot;I just got here, dad, Ryouta and Yukishiro are on their way too.&quot;

&quot;Honoka&#39;s here?&quot;

Nagisa started staring down the hallways and the officers went back on their route. Nagisas 
mother talked to her, but Nagisa didn&#39;t listen, she only though about Honoka. 5 minutes 
after she saw Ryouta approaching, he ran to her and greeted her, she didn&#39;t listen to him 
either. Then finally she caught sight of Honoka, and her father a little longer down the 
fallway, her father waved at her, but she didn&#39;t respond.

&quot;Honoka!&quot;

She shouted out Honokas name and started running at her, it startled Honoka as she didn&#39;t 
expect such a reception from the one that was coming home. Honoka was about to hand her the 
flowers but she didn&#39;t got to say a word before Nagisa already had lifted her off the floor, 
making her drop the flowers, and swung her in a circle, making people dodge the best they 
could. Honoka was shocked and blushed instantly into a magma-color, making her cry from joy 
and reunion.

&quot;Honoka I want to ask you something; something I have been thinking about for the moment I 
first set foot in Denmark.&quot;

&quot;Denmark? I thought it was Andorra you had headed off to.&quot;

Nagisas family was standing silent and a lot of people also gathered to see what was going 
on.

&quot;No it was Denmark, didn&#39;t you see that on the big screens? Anyway, Honoka I want to ask you 
something important.&quot;

Honoka got her mind off the geography of Denmark and Andorra and returned to her 
blushed-out-almost-passed-out state. She was also relieved; as it seemed that she didn&#39;t 
have to say the hard words.

&quot;Honoka.. Do you.. Do you want to.. Will you marry me?&quot;

The whole room became dead-silent. Honoka smiled at Nagisa and began to shed tears once 
again.

&quot;Yes... Yes of course  I will, but can&#39;t we start out being girlfriends and then marry when 
we get older?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

People in the room started to mumble and gossip as Nagisas family approached them. They 
didn&#39;t notice, they were staring into each other&#39;s eyes, nothing else mattered to them right 
now.

&quot;N.. Nagisa are you sure?&quot;

Her mother looked shocked and worried, Ryouta had just encountered homosexuality and Nagisas 
father was half-lolling. Nagisa turned to her mother with a serious look.

&quot;Mom I have thought about this very carefully, I&#39;m determined that Honoka is the love of my 
life!&quot; ***

Later in the evening. Honoka and Nagisa was watching the sun go down. They held hands a lot 
of people starred at them when they walked past them.

&quot;We can go to Andorra next time, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, or you could show me Denmark.&quot;

It was like the whole park was just a bottom of blackness with a pure white sky ending in 
the orange color of the sun. Nagisa and Honoka smiled. Nothing else but each other mattered 
right now and they sealed this, as they joined for their first ever kiss. ***
