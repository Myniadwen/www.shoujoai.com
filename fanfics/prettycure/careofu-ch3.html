<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I awoke lazily on the  fourth day feeling a lot better than I remember being the night  before. My head hurt a little and I could still feel a little of my  fever but for once I didn’t have the desire to crawl in a hole and  die from my stomach. In fact, I was feeling rather comfortable right  now, really safe and secure for some reason. The reason became  apparent when I felt someone shift behind me and cuddle up more. An  arm snaked around my waist and moved up to my chest where it took one  of my hands and absently rubbed it with its thumb. ‘<em>Nagisa  should be on the floor…</em>’ my mind told me as I allowed my eyes  to open. Hikari was in the futon sleeping peacefully, which meant  that Nagisa was, indeed, behind me.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>I’ll  Take Care of You III</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>By:  Satashi</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa?” Honoka  whispered out, turning over as she sat up. “Nagisa… why are you  in my bed?” The girl was half way in focus from her tired eyes,  reaching out to try and find the warmth that had just left her.  “Nagisa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly the blond awoke  and let out a sleepy yawn. “It’s too early,” She muttered out,  rolling on her back and letting her arm lay off the bed. “Go  back’ta sleep…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, you can’t  stay in my bed.” Honoka reached down and shook her shoulder  lightly. “You’ll get sick for sure, now get up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After the  encouragement, Nagisa opened her eyes. “Honoka…” She looked to  the side at the alarm clock. “It’s three in the morning, go back  to sleep…” Reaching up, she brought the girl to lie down halfway  on top of her and proceeded to snuggle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you have to get  out. If you get sick I’ll cry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I’m going to  get sick from being in the same bed with you, then a few more hours  won’t make any difference.” Nagisa smiled at her, still half  asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Out of bed.  Now.” Honoka pulled away from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine…” Nagisa  moved the covers and lazily got out of the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And take these,”  Honoka reached to the nightstand and opened her bottle of medicine.  “Just incase.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t need any  pills,” Nagisa stumbled over to the futon. “You can go ahead and  take them since you’re awake.” She almost fell into the bed with  Hikari, who muttered something about eating a doughnut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, take them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be quiet,” Hikari  moaned, rolling over on her side. “Hm…? Nagisa, you’re warm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be cuddling  all up on me,” She protested lazily before closing her eyes and  reluctantly allowing the younger girl to hold her like a teddy bear.  “Remind me to buy this kid a body pillow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Nagisa…”  Honoka looked down at the two pills in her hand. “Just incase…”  Her answer was a soft snore, making her blink. “How do you fall  asleep that fast…?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The second awakening of  Honoka went a lot smoother than before. She was greeted by the smell  of cinnamon rolls, making her smile even before she fully awoke.  “Wakey wakey,” Nagisa’s voice told her as Honoka opened her  eyes. “Breakfast is served.” She sat down a tray in front of  Honoka as the girl pulled herself up into a sitting position. “You  like these, right?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love them,” Honoka  looked down at the rolls in front of her with a fierce appetite. “Did  you make them?” She cut into one with a fork and started to eat.  “Oh wow, they’re delicious!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari helped,”  She admitted lightly, sitting in front of her on the bed and crossing  her legs. “I did everything but Hikari told me exactly how to do  it… Soooo, I guess it was really her.” She started to eat some as  well. “Hey, they <em>are</em> good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be so hard  on yourself; you can cook just fine when you’re calm about it.”  Honoka ate some more, going faster once they started to cool down. “I  didn’t realize how hungry I was…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow, you’re eating  like me.” Nagisa grinned. “You must be getting better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel ten times  better.” She licked some icing off her fingers. “Even if I am  getting over this, I don’t need to go out for another few days. I  don’t need to relapse.” She picked up a cinnamon roll and bit  into it, disregarding her fork. “Where’s Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She went ahead and  left when Akane called her. She said she’ll stop by again tomorrow  if… it’s… okay…” Nagisa slowed down her speaking and looked  at her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?”  Honoka paused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um… Icing on your  face…” She blushed a little. “Looks like…  Well, it looks  bad.” Her cheeks colored a little more and she looked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Honoka ran  her fingers along her mouth and looked at them. “You’re right…”  Looking back over at her, she smiled. “Hey Nagisa?” Her friend  looked back over at her and froze in shock as Honoka parted her two  fingers, leaving a string of icing between them, and then putting the  both in her mouth and sucking them clean.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… wow…” Her  breath caught in her throat as she watched the girl clean the rest of  her face. “Um… hehe… that is… whoa…” She went stiff when  Honoka leaned forward and wiped a little off her own cheek and then  licked her finger right in front of her face. “I’m… going to  take a bath…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t stay too  long,” Honoka teased happily. She watched her girlfriend quickly  grab some cloths and run out of the room, trying her best not to look  at her. “I love you, Nagisa!” She called out as she heard the  footsteps run from her door. ‘<em>Ha ha ha! The cinnamon rolls are  all mine now!</em>’ She picked another one up and bit into it  happily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An hour and a half  later Honoka heard her bedroom door open again and a semi-wet Nagisa  walked in with a light blush on her face. “Was it good for you  too?” Honoka asked lightly as she read her book while lying on the  bed. This got a stammered out response, making her giggle even more.  A moment later the bed sank down and she looked over at her. Nagisa  was wearing a long sleeved white button up shirt that went to her  knees, most of the latches were done but since she was wet, it still  left little to her imagination. Shifting, Honoka laid her head across  Nagisa’s lap and closed her eyes. A moment passed before she felt  fingers start to run through her hair, making her sigh out contently.  “I like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Nagisa  grinned as she looked down at her friend. “Have you taken your  medicine yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm,” She yawned  lightly. “Took my temperature too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ninety- nine point  two,” Honoka smiled to herself. “Amazing how one day I can barely  get out of bed and two days later I feel well enough to tease you  again.” The hand in her hair stopped a moment before continuing to  pet her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re no fun.  First you kick me out of bed, then you tease me and leave me alone in  the bath…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m so sorry,”  Honoka purred, nuzzling her stomach. “Being alone with you for so  long and not being able to touch you has been driving me nuts too…  Tell you what…” Honoka opened her eyes and looked up at her.  “After I’m better, I’ll treat you to some chocolate.” She got  a small nod so she continued. “And I’ll feed it to you, too.”  Nagisa seemed a little happier at hearing that. “Sound fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very,” She stroked  Honoka’s hair a little more. “Just be sure you’re okay before  you go around town too much okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, silly.”  She looked up at her. “Know what I really want to do now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The rest of our  homework.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa sighed. “How  on earth did I know that was coming?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa looked at her  notebook, eyes lightly glazed over. She took a moment to rub her eyes  with the back of her hand, but the numbers still didn’t want to  seem to focus to her. “I think I need a break,” She thought aloud  as she leaned back onto the bed. “I can’t seem to think  straight.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re almost done,  you sure?” Honoka pushed up her glasses as she worked out a  problem.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Yeah, I’m sure.  Actually I want to lie down.” The blond crawled up onto Honoka’s  bed and laid on it. “I changed your sheets today, so can I lie on  your bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure thing,”  Honoka’s mind was still focused on the problem she was working on.  “Sweet dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks,” Nagisa  sighed out and closed her eyes.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Ugh…” Nagisa  moaned as she rolled over and out of the bed. Honoka was asleep in  the futon even though it was only getting to be around dinner time.  “I feel funny,” She whispered as she staggered her way out of the  room and outside in the cold. Quickly trotting to the main section of  the house she made her way to the bathroom where she quickly turned  on the water faucet and rinsed her mouth out, panting. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think  I’m going to…</span></em>’ Nagisa’s mind didn’t even have time to  finish her thought before she started to throw up in the toilet.  ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This isn’t happening… this isn’t happening…</span></em>’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When done, she coughed  a few times before returning to the sink to wash out her mouth. ‘<em>I’m  not sick. I can’t be sick. I had a flu shot, I can’t believe  this…</em>’ The girl put her hands on the counter and looked at  herself in the mirror. Her face was red and her eyes were watering  slightly. ‘<em>I just got too hot in the bath earlier and it upset  my stomach…That’s all.</em>’ Nodding at herself she washed her  face before heading into the kitchen and getting a drink for herself  and another for Honoka just incase she got thirsty later. The way  back to the room was taken quickly and she felt a lot better once she  was in the warm room again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa?” Honoka  looked up from the futon and over at her. “What’cha up to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing, just  getting a drink.” She sat down beside her and offered the glass of  water to the girl. “Here, you taken your medicine the last four  hours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh uh,” Honoka  raised herself up and looked at her. “You look a little red.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stayed in the cold  too long,” Nagisa giggled to herself and got two pills out for her  friend. “Here, take these.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Honoka  did as she was told and smiled at her. “Have you called your  parents lately?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh uh, if I do  they’ll probably tell me its time to come home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw. But I understand  that; you haven’t been home in four days now. I’m sure you’ve  been bored a lot while I was asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got by,” Nagisa  chuckled to herself. “Between all the books I brought and the TV,  I’ve always had something to keep my preoccupied.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm….” Honoka  smiled and hugged the girl. “Thanks for taking care of me…” Her  voice trained off. “Honey you feel kind of warm.” She put her  hand on Nagisa’s forehead. “You are! You don’t feel bad do  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all!”  Nagisa lied with a smile. “I’m telling you, it’s just because I  was outside too long.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka gave her a look.  “Nagisa, are you lying to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” Honoka  grabbed bottle of pills and took two of the remaining few out. “Take  these. Now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka, I’m not  going to take your medicine, you need them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said take them,”  Honoka glared. “I mean it; I don’t want you to get sick because  of me.” She forced them into the other girl’s hand and then gave  her the glass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka stared at her  until Nagisa sighed and did as she was told. “There, happy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, not really.”  Honoka felt of her forehead, then of Nagisa’s. “You’re warmer  than I am,” She sighed. “Nagisa, sweetie, you may be getting a  cold or something; if you are then you’ll catch my flu really  easily. You may need to go home after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa was about to  protest but a sudden feeling in her stomach made her bite back the  words. “I guess you’re right.” The statement made Honoka’s  eyes water lightly. “Ah! What’s wrong!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are sick…”  She sniffed lightly. “You would never agree just like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just worried  about my family,” Nagisa stood up and walked over to her duffle bag  and pulled out some cloths to change into. “Hikari is coming  tomorrow to check up on you, so I won’t feel as bad leaving you  alone. Be sure to get rest even if you are feeling better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, do you  really feel okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course!” Nagisa  finished changing her cloths. “Do you mind if I leave this stuff  here so I won’t have to carry it all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka’s face fell.  “Yeah, you can leave it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka… Really,”  She gave the girl a hug after kneeling down. “I was playing in the  snow, that’s all.” She gently kissed her forehead. “I’m going  to head out before it gets too dark, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” Honoka let  her hand trail down her lover’s arm as she stood and held onto her  fingertips until she was too far away. “Be careful on your way home  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always!” Nagisa  gave her a peace sign and ran to the front gates, waving to her again  before she walked through them.  Once outside, Nagisa leaned against  the cold wood. “I feel a little tired still…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka listened to the  phone ring for the third time before a familiar voice answered it.  “Misumi residence, Rie speaking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Misumi-san,”  Honoka greeted her. “It’s Honoka.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honoka-chan, how are  you feeling?” She seemed happy to hear from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m feeling a lot  better now,” Honoka bit her lip lightly. “I sent Nagisa home, she  just left now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad, it’s  just not the same without her running around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…Um…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She felt like she  had a fever, but she said she’s fine. Could you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rie sighed. “Don’t  worry dear; she didn’t get it from you. Nagisa called me the day  after she stayed the night and told me she got a flu shot when she  got groceries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s!-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She did it so she  could stay with you. After a night already there was no way she  wasn’t going to get sick so I let her take care of you and just  hoped for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That girl…”  Honoka still smiled to herself. Nagisa cried for almost half an hour  the last time she had to get a shot. “Please look after her for  me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will do,  Honoka-chan.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa leaned against  the door to her apartment with her head resting against it.  She  panted a little bit before opening it up and stepping in. “I’m  home!” she called out as she took off her shoes.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome back kiddo!”  Her father called from the living room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Miss me?” She  added as she walked by, getting a laugh and a nod. “Hey mom!” She  walked by, but had her arm grabbed lightly. “What is it?” She  blinked when she got a hand on her forehead. “Mom?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa, do you know  what a flu shot is?” She asked her, leading her to the girl’s  bedroom and sitting her down on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course, its  anti-flu medicine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And do you know  exactly how that works?” She took a thermometer and popped it in  the girl’s mouth before she could protest. “It’s injecting a  little bit of the virus into your body in such a small amount that it  will learn how to fight it off. A calculated risk, you could say.”  The look on her daughter’s face showed that she probably figured  out what that meant, but she told her anyway. “Which basically  comes down to you just begging to get sick after staying with Honoka  for the night since you already had the virus in you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blonde’s face  fell and her mother removed the thermometer. “100.2, not as bad as  I thought after walking home in the cold. I washed your sheets and  made your bed, and your father is going to pick up your medicine in a  few minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…This sucks.”  Nagisa pulled the covers to her chin after getting in bed. “I can’t  believe this…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa opened her eyes  on the third day of her being sick and was greeted with the sight of  Hikari by her beside. “Hey there,” she greeted, leaning forward  and looking at her. “You feel any better?” Nagisa shook her head  lightly. “That’s not good.” Hikari pouted a little. “Your mom  told us that you get over little things fast but when you get sick,  you get <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">really</span></em> sick.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa gave her a weak  grin. “Yeah…” Her voice was hoarse and scratchy. “Honoka got  over it really fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had someone to  take care of me,” Honoka spoke up for the first time, making Nagisa  look over to her desk where the girl was sitting. “Sorry Honey,  your mom made me promise to keep away from you or she wouldn’t let  me in your room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,”  Nagisa offered weakly. “I don’t want you to relapse. Feeling  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just fine,” Honoka  gave her a sad look. “I’m really, really sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was my own dumb  fault,” Nagisa closed her eyes again. “Hikari, you better not get  sick too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be fine,  don’t worry.” She smiled down at her. “Akane made you some  Takoyaki if you are up to eating it?” The words made Nagisa’s  face drain of color. “O-Or I could just give them to your mother  instead!” She laughed nervously. The three talked about nothing in  particular for almost an hour before Nagisa started to nod off again,  signaling that it was probably time for the girls to make their way  home. Honoka stood up as Hikari said her goodbye and started to walk  over to her but was blocked by the younger girl. “Don’t even  think about kissing her,” She warned, pulling the purple haired  girl to the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry again,  Nagisa.” She told her, getting a soft smile in return. “I love  you sweetie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you too,  Honoka.” Nagisa told her, blowing a kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honoka blushed lightly  and turned to the door, almost running into Rie. “Ah, sorry…”  She looked up at the woman and felt her cheeks color a little. She  knew that Nagisa’s mother knew the two girls were dating but this  was the first time Honoka had ever shown any affection to her  girlfriend in front of her. “I’ll… um… be on my way.” She  giggled shyly, getting a smile in return from the older woman.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Honoka greeted Nagisa  happily at her house, giving the girl a fierce hug. “Nagisa! I’m  glad you came!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too,” She  hugged her lover back tightly. “I was going to go nuts at home.  I’ve felt fine for the past three days but mom refused to let me  come see you until she was positive I was over it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hard to believe we  only have a few days left…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, talk about a  blown by vacation. It was nothing more than random parts of being  awake and sleeping all day long.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We should do  something special tonight so we’ll have something to remember it  by.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” The  two girls walked into the living room of the house, where Honoka  already had a fire going.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” Honoka  turned around to walk backwards, smiling at her. “Since you came  over so late, my grandmother is already asleep…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Nagisa  grinned happily, noticing there were different chocolate candies in  front of the fireplace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmhmm…” Honoka  motioned for her to sit down in front of the coffee table. “And I  did promise you I’d treat you to chocolate…” She leaned forward  and put their foreheads together. “As a thank you for looking after  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like where this is  going,” Nagisa cooed up at her, feeling Honoka take her wrist and  sliding them behind her own back. She was about to ask, but found  Honoka kissing her lightly.  Returning the kiss, she felt her  girlfriend put something cool around her wrist and after hearing some  clicking sounds realized that she had just had her wrist handcuffed  behind her back. “Honoka?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The purple haired girl  smiled seductively at her and opened a chocolate bar carefully,  breaking off a section of its semi-melted state. “Ready for some  chocolate?” she asked her huskily, smearing a little bit of the  melted substance on Nagisa’s cheek. She took the blush as a ‘yes’  and placed the bit on her tongue before leaning forward and frenching  her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa tried to move  her hands, but was quickly reminded that she was bound. “H-Honoka…  we could get caught…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not likely,” She  replied happily, smiling as she leaned in for another kiss. “I’ve  wanted to make love in front of the fireplace for a long time now and  I’m not going to miss this chance…”</span></p>
