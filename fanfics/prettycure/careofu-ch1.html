<p>“Ahhh!” I stretched  out happily while the cool wind blew around me. “Winter Vacation! I  can hardly wait!” My hands gripped the fence that surrounded the  top of the school building and I looked over the town. “I want to  do so many things! I’m going to build a snowman, make snow-ice  cream, drink hot chocolate and stuff myself with winter candies!” I  looked back over to my friend. “Ne, Honoka! What are you going to  do over the break? Want to come over for a night or two?” When she  didn’t reply to me right away I blinked and turned around fully.  “Honoka?”</p>
<p align="center"><strong>I’ll  Take Care of You</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>By:</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Satashi</strong></p>
<p>Honoka looked over at  Nagisa and smiled lightly. “Sorry, I didn’t hear what you said.”  She sniffed and looked back down at her lunch, which barely had two  bites taken out of it. The wind blew around her and she shivered,  pulling her jacket closer around herself and putting Nagisa’s  discarded one over her legs.</p>
<p>“Honoka? What’s  wrong?” Nagisa kneeled down beside her friend. “You look kind of  spaced out.” She looked down at her covers. “Are you cold? Do you  want to go back inside?”</p>
<p>“… Yes, I’d like  that.”</p>
<p>“If you didn’t want  to eat lunch up here you could have told me…” Nagisa helped the  girl up before gathering their things. “You didn’t eat much…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m not very  hungry…” Honoka closed her eyes and took a breath. “Do you mind  if we hurry?”</p>
<p>“Eh?” Nagisa looked  at her a little closer. “Honoka, your cheeks are all red.” She  put her hands on them and gasped out. “You’re burning up!”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing  really. I’d like it if we went inside.” She took a step and  wobbled a little bit.</p>
<p>“Come on,” Nagisa  frowned and scooped the girl up in her arms. “You’re going to the  nurse’s office.”</p>
<p>“Nagisa… I can walk  just fine.”</p>
<p>“No,” The blond  nudged the door leading inside open and proceeded to carry her down  the stairs and through the hallway.</p>
<p>“Nagisa…everyone is  looking!” Her hands came up to cover her face. “Please put me  down.”</p>
<p>“Nuh uh,” Nagisa  smiled at her friends, who were squealing at her. “You’re going  to the nurse’s office and that’s final.” The rest of the way  was made in silence with Honoka burying her head against Nagisa’s  chest in embarrassment. “Anyone here?” She called out after  carefully opening the door and walking in to the office.</p>
<p>“I’m here,” a  middle aged woman answered, walking around a curtain. “Oh,  Misumi-san, hurt yourself again?” She noticed the girl in her arms  and gasped out. “Oh my, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I think Honoka’s  sick,” She replied with a little worry in her voice. “She has a  fever and isn’t eating.”</p>
<p>“I’m just fine,”  Honoka whispered through her hands, moving her fingers to see if  anyone was around to see her. “Please put me down?”</p>
<p>“Okay,” If Honoka  was expecting to be placed on her feet, she was wrong. The girl  carefully laid her onto an empty bed and pushed her back down when  she tried to sit up. “Not until you get your temperature taken.”  Nagisa took off her shoes and swished the covers up to her chest to  show her determination.</p>
<p>“Mou…” Honoka  pouted up at her. “It’s the last day before vacation, I can’t  miss class now!”</p>
<p>“I’ll get your  assignments.” Nagisa protested, once again pushing her back down.</p>
<p>“It must be nice to  have such a caring friend,” The nurse walked over to her with a  digital thermometer. “Put this under your tongue, okay?” She got  a sigh from the girl, but she did as she was told. “It’s rare to  see you in here, Yukishiro-san.”</p>
<p>“Eh? You know each  other?” Nagisa looked over at the two girls.</p>
<p>“She has helped me  many times along with the science club. Actually the thermometer in  her mouth was one she designed. It gets a much more accurate  reading.”</p>
<p>“Wow, amazing.” She  looked down at Honoka with a grin. “How about that, using your own  device.” She got a mean look in return, making her laugh.</p>
<p>“Much better than  when you come to visit me,” the nurse came to Honoka’s defense.  “Twisted ankles, cuts and scrapes, bruises, you even cracked your  ribs that one time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t remind me,”  Nagisa made a face. “The bruise on my side didn’t go away for  weeks.”</p>
<p>“Rough housing sports  players, I swear.” She took the thermometer from Honoka’s mouth  and looked at it. “Oh my, my, my. 103.2. Yukishiro-san, what are  you doing at school?”</p>
<p>“Um… Final day  before vacation?”</p>
<p>“Is that bad?”  Nagisa asked, looked over at them.</p>
<p>“Ninety-eight point  six is the normal temperature,” the nurse told her as she stood.  “Up to 103 is a nice bout of being sick, anything above that is  normally a virus or bacterial infection.” She took out some  medicine and scribbled something on a notepad. “Do you have anyone  that can come pick you up?”</p>
<p>“I’m staying till  the end of the day,” Honoka told her, a little upset. “I have to  get my homework assignments and everything.”</p>
<p>“You, my little girl,  are not leaving this room until either the bell rings to go home or  someone picks you up.” The nurse told her firmly, making Honoka  pull the covers up to her nose to try and hide. “Tell me how you  feel.”</p>
<p>“I feel just fine,”  was the answer. Honoka looked over at Nagisa lightly.</p>
<p>“Oh. Misumi-san, you  can get back to class now, I’ll take care of her.” She got a  surprised reaction, so she said it again. “I’ll take care of her,  now get your butt to class and try to stay out of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Mou, you’re mean  Naki-san!” Nagisa stood up anyway and looked down at Honoka. “I’ll  get all your stuff, so just relax.” With that she walked over to  the door and gave one last glance over her shoulder before walking  out.</p>
<p>“You two must be  friends,” Honoka said after the door closed.</p>
<p>“I see her in here at  least twice a week for Lacrosse injuries.” Naki crossed her arms  and sighed. “She acts tough but she’s scared to death of getting  hurt and not being able to play her best. She comes in for every  little thing that worries her.”</p>
<p>“She has to take care  of her team,” Honoka smiled to herself. “She’s thoughtful like  that.”</p>
<p>“Now, how do you  feel?” Naki sat on the stool next to her.</p>
<p>Honoka closed her eyes  and swallowed. “Honestly?”</p>
<p>“Yes, honestly.”</p>
<p>Small teardrops came to  her closed eyes. “I think I’m going to throw up…”</p>
<p>“Jeez,” Naki helped  the girl out of bed and led her to a small bathroom where the girl  proceeded to get sick. “Don’t try to put up a show for your  friends or you’ll really make yourself sick…” She sighed and  ran some water for her to rinse her mouth out with. “Any better?”</p>
<p>Honoka nodded lightly.  “Sorry…”</p>
<p>“Oh come on, I deal  with this kind of thing at least once a week.” Naki smiled and  helped her back to the bed. “Now, who should I call?”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Nagisa opened the door  to the nurse’s office and peeked in. “Naki-san? You here?”
<p>“I am,” Was the  reply, making the girl look to the side. The nurse was filling out  some papers at the moment. “Yukishiro isn’t here anymore,  though.”</p>
<p>“Where is she?”</p>
<p>“At home. I called  your mother to come pick her up,” She read over the paper in front  of her and nodded to herself. “I was surprised to find out your mom  is on her sign out list.”</p>
<p>“Eh, well, it would  be a problem if her grandmother needed her or something so…” She  scratched her cheek. “But besides that, how is she?”</p>
<p>“Sick as a dog I’m  afraid. She has the flu.” Naki stood up and handed her the papers.  “Since you’re so close to her I don’t feel bad leaving this in  your hands.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” She  took the papers and read over them. “I don’t understand it…”</p>
<p>“It’s her  prescription; you can have it filled at any drug store. She has the  school insurance so that’ll take care of the payment, but she needs  to start taking it right away. Will you get it for her?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Nagisa  folded the paper and pocketed it. She turned to leave the room but  paused, looking back at the nurse. “She’ll… be okay right?”</p>
<p>Naki smiled at her.  “Yes, Misumi-san, she’ll be fine in a few days. Now get going and  enjoy your vacation.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Mom?” Nagisa spoke  into the payphone, looking at the piece of paper in front of her. “I  need to know where the drugstore you always go to is… Yeah… Yeah,  I’m picking up Honoka’s medicine. How did she look when you got  there? … Okay, I understand… Right… Right… Okay mom, I got  you already…” Nagisa sighed. “Yes mam, I know… I know. I know  already mom.” She turned around and looked out the glass at the  busy street. “I’m going to take care of her so I probably won’t  be back till late. I <em>know</em> mom. Jeez. Thanks for the  directions, I’ll call you later.” She hung up the phone before  her mother could pester her anymore. ‘<em>You don’t have to say  the same thing a million times,</em>’ She thought to herself as she  walked along her way. ‘<em>I know she’s sick, that’s why I’m  going to take care of her…</em>’
<p>An hour later Nagisa  found herself at Honoka’s house and let herself in. “Hey there  Chutaro,” She leaned over to pet the dog’s head. “Where’s  your grandmother, huh?” She got a bark in reply and he ran over to  the side of the house towards Honoka’s room. Following him, she  hopped up onto the walkway and ran her fingers along the wall.  “Honoka, I’m here,” She called lightly, opening the sliding  door and stepping in the room. “Ah, it’s cold in here.” She saw  Honoka lying on the bed; still in her school cloths and half covered  by the blankets. After cutting the heater on she went over to the bed  and let her backpack fall to the ground “Honoka? Honoka, wake up.”  She shook the girl lightly. “You need to change, you’ll freeze in  that skirt…”</p>
<p>Honoka lightly opened  her eyes and half way focused on her friend. “Nagisa…” She  shivered lightly and curled into a ball.</p>
<p>“Where’s your  grandmother?” She asked softly, walking over to the closet and  picking out some pajamas for her friend to wear.</p>
<p>“She’s on a trip  with her old friends remember?” Honoka’s voice was soft, almost  to the point of not being heard. “She won’t be back for four  days.”</p>
<p>“Oh… I forgot.”  Nagisa slid the closet door closed and walked back over to her  friend. “Here, you need to change.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to  move…”</p>
<p>“Come on,” She  gently put her hands under the girl. “Honoka you’re burning up.  How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Fine,”</p>
<p>“Be honest,” Nagisa  managed to lift her up and felt her heart sink when Honoka’s head  fell against her chest, obviously too tired to even hold herself up.  “Honoka…” Placing a hand on her neck, she sighed out. “You  have a serious fever…”</p>
<p>“Mmm….”</p>
<p>“I’m going to  change your cloths, all right?” She got a small nod from her friend  so she began to slowly undress her, a task a lot more difficult than  the past few times she had done so. Of course those times, Honoka was  helping the clothing to come off… Nagisa shook her head. ‘<em>I  can’t think about that right now.</em>’ The buttons were undone on  her school issued shirt and it came off after a little encouragement.  “Why do you wear stuff like this when you’re sick?” The girl  asked as she removed the lacy see-through bra.</p>
<p>“It makes me feel  pretty,” Honoka replied half heartedly, lifting her arms so the  pajama top could be placed over her. “Thank you, goodnight.” She  fell back on the bed, making her friend sigh out and undo her skirt  and pull off her socks.</p>
<p>“Your legs,” Nagisa  told her, trying to cloth the girl. After a little struggling while  trying not to move her much, she reached her goal of putting on the  pajama pants. “Honoka? Stay with me just a little bit longer okay?  I’m going to get you water for your medicine.”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>Nagisa hurried off to  the kitchen and got a glass of water while making some toast. After  smearing just a little bit of jam on them she walked back to the  bedroom and opened the door with her foot. “I’m back,” She slid  the door closed the same way and walked over to her, sitting on the  bed. “Can you sit up?” She got a small nod, but still had to help  her. “The doctor told me you would be a little out of it the first  day but I didn’t think it would be this bad…” Honoka gave her a  light giggle. “Here, you need to eat something.” She offered a  piece of toast, which was taken. After a series of small bites Honoka  shook her head. “That’ll do for now then. Here,” She offered  two pills and the water, which was taken after being stared at for a  few moments. “Good girl,” Nagisa helped her friend lay back down  on the bed and looked at her sadly.</p>
<p>Bringing the covers up  to her shoulders, Nagisa smiled softly at her. “I’ll be back in a  bit,” She whispered. The girl made her way out of the room and went  to the living room to make a phone call.</p>
<p>Honoka awoke a few  hours later, slowly blinking her eyes she sat up in bed and looked  around. Her room was dark save for a small reading light by her bed.  The sun had already gone down, making it even darker than normal. She  looked over beside her bed, seeing a small bottle of medicine and a  fresh glass of water. The girl brought her knees up to her chest and  hugged them, placing her chin on her kneecaps. A part of her wanted  to get something to eat, the other strongly opposing the idea. After  a small internal debate the need for food won over so she pushed the  covers back and turned to get out of bed.</p>
<p>The door opened slowly,  making Honoka look up at it. Nagisa turned around and gently slid the  door closed before turning once more to face the room. “Ah! I  didn’t wake you did I?” She got a slow shake of her head in  reply, so Nagisa walked over and putt some bags down by Honoka’s  desk. “How are you feeling now?” She asked lightly, putting a  hand to her friend’s forehead. “You’re still really hot.”</p>
<p>“Nagisa?” a soft  ‘hm’ showed that the girl was listening. “I thought you left?”</p>
<p>“I did,” Nagisa  smiled at her. “I went home and got some cloths and went shopping  for food.” She pointed at the bags by the desk. “I know my  cooking isn’t the best, but I’ll be extra-extra careful, so  please tell me if you want anything…?”</p>
<p>Honoka looked at her a  moment. “You’re… going to stay here with me?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Nagisa  sounded like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “Who would  leave their love alone when they’re sick?” She gently moved  Honoka back in the bed and pulled the covers up to her waist so she  could stay sitting up. “I have all of your assignments from school  and your books and things right here on the desk. I have some other  things to read from my house if you want something funny, and I  brought a few snacks as well,” Nagisa opened her bag and pulled out  a few different kind of crackers and cookies. “I figured if you  were going to nibble on something it would be something to help  settle your stomach… Are you hungry? Do you want me to make  anything? Are you Cold? Hot? Want me to open the door or turn on the  lights?”</p>
<p>Honoka closed her eyes  and smiled happily. “I could use a hug?”</p>
<p>“I can do that,”  Nagisa sat next to her and hugged the girl as tight as she thought  was okay for her being sick. “I’ll be here for you, so whatever  you need just ask okay?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Nagisa,”  Honoka gave her an extra squeeze before pulling away from the hug.  She leaned forward to kiss her cheek but thought better of it before  her lips made it. “I guess I shouldn’t do that while sick.”</p>
<p>Nagisa smiled at her  before kissing two of her fingers and then touching them to Honoka’s  lips. “There, a kiss from me to you.”</p>
<p>Honoka reached up and  enveloped Nagisa’s hand with both of hers, gently kissing the  fingers as well. “Go was your hands right away,” She smiled,  getting a laugh.</p>
<p>“Yes mam. I’ll be  right back.”</p>
<p>Honoka watched the girl  leave the room and felt a lot better now that she wouldn’t be alone  while sick. Looking over at the snacks, she opened a bag of crackers  and proceeded to very slowly nibble on one while waiting for her  girlfriend to come back. ‘<em>This won’t be as bad as I thought,</em>’  she mused, happy at having Nagisa around.</p>
