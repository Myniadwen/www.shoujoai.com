------------------------------------------------------------

( Akari&#39;s Bedroom, University Satellite, Late evening.)

Akari and Kris are talking on the sofa, they&#39;re talking about all the things
they&#39;d done together on the Satellite.

&quot;Time has gone by so fast Kris, and tomorrow , you&#39;ll be gone.&quot; said Akari
with her head hanging low.

&quot;It&#39;s ok, I had a great time here.&quot; said Kris, just then Akari lays her head
on Kris&#39;s shoulder and cries.

&quot;NO! It&#39;s NOT ok Kris, they&#39;re making you go home. They make you do what you
don&#39;t want too. WHY KRIS?!&quot; Yelled Akari with tears in her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m to become a priestess Akari, I&#39;m sorry, but, I must obey my home-land
customs.&quot; Kris said quietly.

They stayed like that for a while, then Kris picked up Akari&#39;s face to hers
and kissed her fully on the lips.

After breaking the kiss Kris said, &quot;That kiss is a promise that one day,
will see each other again.&quot;

Akari was speechless, It was her first kiss ever, and it was from someone
that she held dear too.*Is this love?* Akari had to know.

&quot;Kris?&quot; Akari stumbled on the words,&quot;Can you love a friend?&quot;

Kris looked confused for a moment then her face went into a soft smile,
&quot;Yes, if they truly close enough, they can love as while as be friends.&quot;

Akari inched closer, &quot;Kris, I....I..&quot; and was shocked as Kris placed a hand
on her knee, &quot;Shhhh. I know, I love you too Akari.&quot;

Kris then kissed Akari more fully on her lips, Akari laid on her back so
Kris could be on top still kissing her deeply, after what seemed about
for-ever, Kris broke there kissing cause a line of drool to appear between
both girl&#39;s lips.

&quot;Akari, I&#39;ll give you something, but please, don&#39;t regret it later.&quot; Kris
said in a soft voice.

&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot; said Akari closing her eyes to accept what her friend/lover was
about to do to her.

Kris took off her home-land clothes (it was just one peice, really.) and was
now only in her bra, panties, and her slip-on shoes.

Akari sliped out of her simple pink dress and white blouse to remain in her
undergarments and white tennis socks.

Kris reached behind Akari&#39;s head and pulled her yellow ribbon off, making
her rabbit-like treshes fall into place with the rest of her hair. Then Kris
tied the ribbon to the back to her long sliver hair.

&quot;In my home-land, we exchange something with the partner we&#39;re about to make
love to for the first time.&quot; said Kris as she took off her gold tiara and
locked it around Akari&#39;s head.

Both stood there for a moment, looking at the change in each others
appearance, they couldn&#39;t beleive how a simple garmant could change the way
they look so much, Akari looked like a princess while Kris looked like she
was a normal school girl.

&quot;Beautiful&quot; they both said at the same time.

Kris then walked up to Akari and wraped her arms round her body as she undid
Akari&#39;s bra, then Kris said in Akari&#39;s ear,&quot;Do mine.&quot;

Akari had a header time with Kris&#39;s bra since she was taller, but soon they
looked at eachother breasts, while Akari had more toned, fuller ones, Kris&#39;s
where just amazing, maybe it was the way the moon-light was shining rays off
her, but that, and the mixture of the darkness of the room made Kris even
more beautiful.

&quot;Oh, Kris.&quot; Akari was just in awe in the sight before her.

&quot;Akari.&quot; Kris said with a tear on her cheek.

&quot;Kris? why are you crying?&quot; said Akari, she&#39;d hoped she didn&#39;t messed things
up for looking at her too much.

&quot;It&#39;s ok, it&#39;s just that you look like you should be a moon preistess
yourshelf.&quot; said Kris.

Akari decided to take control now as Akari got up on her tip-toes and kissed
Kris and add some tounge to this kiss, Kris frozed up for a sec then melted
into Akari&#39;s tounge-fight with her own, after a while, Akari body was on
fire with passion, while Kris&#39;s body burned with the desire to make Akari
one with hershelf.

Akari couldn&#39;t hold back her longing anymore, &quot;Kris, I need you, please.&quot;
this was NOT a question.

&quot;Yes Akari, I need you too.&quot; as both athletes went to the sofa again they
both took off their panties and laid on eachother, Akari on top, as they
necked eachother with a passion.

Kris took Akari&#39;s hand, &quot;Touch me.&quot; said Kris as she placed Akari&#39;s left
hand on her breast, &quot;Here.&quot; Akari went with her natural instincts and
started rubbing Kris&#39;s breast around gently stroking the nipple with her
thumb.

&quot;Mmmmm. . . . . &quot; moaned Kris as she returned the favor to Akari, but
instead of just rubbing them, she place her mouth on one of Akari&#39;s breasts.

&quot;Ah.....Kris.....Ah!&quot; Akari has no idea that simple sex like this could,
arouse her this quick, she never really thought about her breasts being
sucked on by another person, Akari moaned even more as she threw her head
back.

Kris stopped and got up to put Akari on her back and got on top of her, then
said&quot; Akari, I&#39;m gonna touch you somewhere, but, don&#39;t be scared, I won&#39;t
hurt you.&quot; Kris pointed to Akari&#39;s vagina and place her hand on it.

Akari was a little scared, noone except her family doctor and mother has
ever touch her there, and it wasn&#39;t for sex. But, this was Kris, her lover.
*She is my friend, she wouldn&#39;t hurt me* thought Akari, she look at Kris and
nodded slowly to her.

Kris then gently moved her hands up and down on Akari&#39;s pussy, Akari&#39;s eyes
rolled into the back of her head and closed them, &quot;Oh......Kris...&quot;

After a while, Akari was pushing her hips up into Kris&#39;s hand to add to the
fire that was building up inside her.

Kris was so hot now that just looking at Akari cumming by just her hand was
enough, but she needed release too. &quot;Akari, touch me too.&quot;

Akari nodded and guided her hand to Kris&#39;s pussy and started doing the same
thing Kris was doing to her, Kris jerked up and called out Akari&#39;s name and
some other words Akari only heard when Kris was doing her Naked-Moon-Dance&#153;.

Kris and Akari and bucking off eachothers hands. Rubbing like crazy now,
Akari was BEYOND words now, and Kris was just quiet except for a small sound
of wimpering that escape for her mouth now and then, but they couldn&#39;t cum
now *I have to do this.* thought Kris.

Kris took her hand off Akari&#39;s now-wet pussy and turned around to rest her
head between Akari legs.

&quot;Kris? What are y- AHHHH....AH....AH!&quot; Akari was shaking her head from side
to side, It was too much for her to handle and she finally went over the
edge.

&quot;Kris... K-Kris...ah...I&#39;m.......ah....I&#39;m....AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

Akari fell back on the couch completely exhaused. Beathiung heavily she
looked up to see Kris getting off of her and laying of the couch just a foot
away from her.

&quot;Kris, I&#39;m sorry, you should have cummed too.&quot; said Akari breathing hard.

&quot;It&#39;s ok, it was fun, and tasty too, but I want you to do something to me.&quot;
Kris spread her legs to Akari, &quot;I want you to put your fingers in there and
break my seal. I want you to be my first.&quot; said Kris.

Akari was shocked,&quot;A-Are you sure Kris?&quot;

Kris nodded and said, &quot;When I go back to the moon, I&#39;ll never be able to be
a mother or have a husband, please Akari, make me a woman.&quot;

Akari got up to get close to Kris and placed the tip of her 2 fingers in
Kris, Kris took Akari fingers out of her and brought them to her mouth to
add some saliva to them to make it easier, Kris then placed the fingers back
to her pussy.

&quot;Are you ready Kris?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kris nodded.

Akari push them in slowly, Kris looked at Akari and then grimiced when Akari
got to her seal in her pussy. Akari got a thought and took Kris&#39;s hand and
place it on her own pussy, Kris looked at Akari with a questionable face and
Akari pushed Kris&#39;s hand in her pussy a litte more.

&quot;We&#39;ll both will become women together.&quot; said Akari with a smile.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; said Kris, Akari smiled again and closed her eyes,&quot;Yes.&quot;

Kris moved her 2 fingers deeper in Akari til she was at her seal, Both girls
nodded to eachother and thrusted deep in eachother to break eachother. They
screamed and looked down to see little streams of blood ozzing out of their
pussies.

&quot;Are you alright Akari?&quot; said Kris.

&quot;I&#39;m ok, they say it only hurts if you stop moving, move your fingers Kris,
but, slowly please.&quot; Kris did as told, and Akari closed her eyes again and
made a low moaning noise, &quot;Mmmmmm...&quot;

Akari started moving her fingers in and out of her friend, Kris was slowly
moving her ass to match Akari&#39;s finger-fuck.

Both girls started getting hot again as they picked up the tempo a bit now.
Kris was holding Akari&#39;s shoulders, as Akari was sucking on Kris&#39;s breasts.
Soon, they couldn&#39;t hold back anymore and Kris came for the first time,
while Akari got her second one that night.

After that, Kris &amp; Akari laid in Akari&#39;s bed and was talking.

&quot;Kris, will I ever see you again?&quot; said Akari cuddling Kris&#39;s arm.

Kris finally made up her mind, &quot;Akari......I want to stay with you, I&#39;m not
going home.&quot;

Akari couldn&#39;t believe it, &quot;Really?!&quot; Akari bounced on the bed.

Kris calmed her down, &quot;Akari, I love you, but I can&#39;t stay on the Satellite
after tonight, I&#39;ll find a place to stay on earth, will you help me?&quot;

&quot;Sure, you can stay at my house in Hokkaido. I live alone so noone will know
your there, and...&quot; Akari said queitly,&quot; I&#39;ll drop out.&quot;

This shocked Kris, &quot;No! Your cosmo beauty now Akari, why would you do that
for me?&quot;

&quot;Silly! Because I love you.&quot; Akari give Kris a peck on the cheek before
laying down, &quot;Let&#39;s talk about it tomarrow ok Kris? *yawn* I&#39;m tired now.&quot;

&quot;And I love you too, Akari-chan.&quot; said Kris as she laid down next to her
friend, her lover, a person she will trust for the rest of her life. *
Things will work out, they always do.*,Kris thought before going to sleep
hershelf.
