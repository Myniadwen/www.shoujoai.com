<h1>The Reason</h1>

<pre>&quot;Itchan ..&quot; 

What reason will you have to run now? 

      Akari cried silently as she ran the triathlon, not quite 
understanding why she was doing it in the first place. Ever since Ichino 
left the school due to her injury, Akari pretty much was just a walking 
zombie with absolutely no motivation to do anything. Days passed and 
Akari would only curl up in her room, isolating herself from everyone. 
She thought of what she could&#39;ve done if she had caught up with her 
Itchan at the shuttle station. 

What reason will you have to run now? 

      Jessie&#39;s words rang clearly in Akari&#39;s head and she grew confused 
and hopeless. No Itchan, no motivation. The words of her classmates 
didn&#39;t phase her, everyone looking down up her...nothing affected her 
anymore because she didn&#39;t have her dearest best friend, Itchan. 
Throughout the entire triathlon she only thought of Ichino until she ran 
into Ling Pha&#39;s trap and she was ready to quit. If it weren&#39;t for 
Itchan&#39;s brother giving her the confidence that Osaka was supporting her 
and indefinitely Itchan herself. 

What reason will you have to run now? 

      A new burst of energy coursed through Akari&#39;s veins and she pumped 
her legs, pedaling to reach her goal of being in the top three and to 
make Ichino proud. Every single emotion she felt was poured into her 
physical body and she had made the jump between last place to second 
place. Nothing could stop Akari, until her armband with Itchan&#39;s number 
fell off in the last leg of the race. Akari couldn&#39;t breathe, couldn&#39;t 
go on, all she could think was of Itchan. 

What reason will you have to run now? 

      Tears sprung up to her eyes and she didn&#39;t know. Everyone was 
supporting her but without Ichino Yanagida it was all for nothing. Then 
she heard her voice. Her reprimanding voice demanding an answer to why 
she had stopped. Akari turned around to see her Itchan and ran with all 
her might, to her goal, not the finish line, but the most important 
person in the world to her... 

&quot;ITCHAAAN!!&quot; and she ran until she was wrapped up in her embrace. The 
rain stopped, and the clouds cleared up, leaving the bright shining sun 
in its presence. Akari had finished first and no doubt, made Ichino very 
proud. They stood in front of the tree, the words &quot;Akari, Ichino&quot; 
written into it. 

&quot;Ne, Akari. Let&#39;s make another promise. Next year, I will enter 
University Satellite for sure with you waiting for me...as the Cosmo 
Beauty!&quot; Ichino grinned proudly. 

Akari&#39;s eyes grew large, &quot;EHHH?&quot; Ichino just smiled, her heart 
fluttering like it always did whenever she was with Akari. Silence 
surrounded them and Ichino stepped closer to her, shifting her weight to 
her uninjured leg. Her hand came up to the side of her face and 
whispered, &quot;I know you can do it...&quot; 

What reason will you have to run now? 

      It had always been Itchan. Akari&#39;s face grew heated as Itchan 
searched her eyes, &quot;Akari...wait for me.&quot; Ichino&#39;s gaze became soft as 
she leaned in closer, &quot;I love you...wait for me.&quot; Akari&#39;s breathing 
became slightly heavy as the distance between the two lessened. &quot;Promise 
me.&quot; Itchan held very still, her lips lightly grazing against her best 
friend&#39;s as she spoke. &quot;Akari very quietly spoke, &quot;Yes, I promise to 
wait for you.&quot; Just like that, both of their eyes closed as lips met 
lips in a sweet tender kiss. 

CLICK! Whirrr. The sound of a camera caused both of them to jump back in 
surprise. A grinning boy was holding a huge camera that resembled Ling 
Pha&#39;s trademark &quot;Memento&quot; camera. &quot;AHHHH!&quot; Itchan yelled and began 
chasing after her brother despite her injured leg while Akari stood 
silent with her fingers pressed against her lips. A heavy blush covered 
her face but no one could&#39;ve missed the small smile. 

Months Later 

      Akari was at University Satellite, keeping her end of the promise 
and doing her best to become Cosmo Beauty. She had made it into the 
contest and was currently at a party with her roommates. Anna was a 
great girl who was an incredible cook as well as being incredibly sweet. 
Then there came Kris, the girl she had bumped into and claimed that they 
were destined to be together. Akari was often found in compromising 
positions with her but always demanded to be let go. 

      Everyone at the University assumed that they were together despite 
Akari&#39;s protest. Yet, she never brought up Ichino because she didn&#39;t 
find the need to...she was here to keep her promise to her love and she 
was going to keep it. Akari was enjoying the party so far until a 
serious faced Kris popped up in front of her. 

      &quot;Akari...who is this?&quot; the tall, cerulean haired girl held a stern 
face as she showed her the picture of Ichino with her arm around Akari 
in a &quot;V!&quot; pose. Akari questioned Kris where she got it but soon her face 
grew calm as she smiled and took the picture. &quot;What is she to you?&quot; Kris 
demanded. &quot;That&#39;s Itchan. Someone very dear to me.&quot; 

      Kris cried in anguish, &quot;EHHH?!&quot; Anna tried keeping her calm, &quot;Ms. 
Christopher!&quot; Kris held onto Akari with tears in her eyes, &quot;Very dear to 
you? To what extent?&quot; It was quite comical the way Kris held onto Akari, 
her hands shaking the poor girl, wanting some answers. Throughout the 
whole shaking, Akari&#39;s student ID in its plastic case fell off. It 
landed face down to see a picture squeezed in the back of the plastic 
case. 

      Anna squinted and picked it up, drawing the attention of Kris who 
had stopped crying for a minute to stare. A tree with the words &quot;Akari, 
Ichino&quot;. Akari leaning up with her hands on Ichino&#39;s shoulders and her 
eyes closed blissfully. Ichino with one arm wrapped around her waist and 
the other hand holding her cheek, a warm blush on her face. Akari 
hastily grabbed her student ID from Anna. 

      Kris went back to her hysterical crying, this time on top of 
Gyubei. The shouts of &quot;Attack of the Cow!!&quot; was heard all night. Akari 
stared at the picture for a little bit with a blissful smile before 
looking up at the sight before her. She sighed and shook her head before 
commenting Anna, &quot;Itchan is very dear to me. She is the reason why I 
run.&quot; 
 
 

A/N: One Shot. I haven&#39;t written in awhile and I am quite aware of the 
fact that the scenes didn&#39;t quite like the TV show. I couldn&#39;t remember 
them quite well but I&#39;ve been meaning to write a story. I&#39;ll have some 
more one-shots up. Hopefully soon. Please review. Constructive criticism 
is accepted. Just keep in mind I&#39;m not exactly the best writer out 
there.</pre>
