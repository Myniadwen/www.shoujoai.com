------------------------------------------------------------

 (University Satellite, the next day.)

 &quot;Is this what you really want, Miss Kanzaki?&quot;

 The Headmaster sat at the side of his desk, looking out into space. He
 couldn&#39;t believe that after all the hard work and time Akri put into this,
 she was ready to leave the Satellite on the very first year.

 Grant Oldman, after a heavy sigh, finally turns to look at Akari.

 She stood just behind the office door, her head was bowed to keep the
 Headmaster from seeing her eyes. But, there was something &quot;different&quot;
 about Akari today, but he couldn&#39;t figure it out for the life of him.

 &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Akari finally replied in a small voice, she knew that this
 would be hard to do. To tell the Headmaster that she wanted to drop-out,
 but she loved Kris. And Kris loved her, and that was more than enough
 reason to leave the school, right?

 &quot;Akari...&quot; The Headmaster began. &quot;You DO know that if you leave the
 University Satellite, you forfeit your title of Cosmo Beauty to Lahrri.
 And once you leave, you can never return....&quot;

 Akari bit her lip at that to keep from crying and kept her calm, &quot;I
 understand, sir.&quot;

 Grant couldn&#39;t take it anymore and looked right at Akari, and just came
 out and said it, &quot;Why? Why are you throwing all of this away for Akari?
 You worked so hard to get this far.&quot; Grant saw tears running down and
 falling on Akari&#39;s uniform. &quot;And your mother wanted you here Miss Kanza-&quot;

 &quot;DON&#39;T YOU DARE BRING MY MOTHER INTO THIS!!!&quot; Akari yelled, making the
 Headmaster stop,&quot; I did EXACTLY what she said, I won the title of Cosmo
 Beauty, to find the road that was choosen for me!&quot; Akari snapped her head
 up to stare at Grant, she continued, &quot;And what makes you think that this
 isn&#39;t part of the road Sir! My mother even said that there are MANY path
 to follow into the fulture!&quot;

 &quot;Some paths are better then others, Akari.&quot; Grant Oldman stated.

 Akari, for the first time, wanted to slap the Headmaster. But calmed down.
 &quot;My decision is final.&quot; Akari turned to the door to leave, &quot;Thank you for
 everything Sir.&quot;

 As the door open for her to leave, Grnt still wanted to know why was she
 dropping-out, &quot;But you never answered my question Akari.&quot;

 Akari walked out the door, &quot;Shitsuree-shimashita.&quot; And the door closed
 behind her.

 The Headmaster went and sat down in his chair to think, *I just don&#39;t
 understand, why would Akari want to leave the University all of a sudden?*
 Then a idea formed in Grant&#39;s head, *Maybe I can still get her back here.*
 The headmaster then pressed a button of the desk and a holographed picture
 of his secretary popped up.&quot;Get me the University training grounds of
 Antartica, and paged for a Miss Ichino Yamagita.&quot;

 And woman on the screen bowed, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; and the screen disappeared,
 leaving a smiling Headmaster to himself.

 (Back to Akari&#39;s room)

 Kris was just finshed packing the last of her belongings when Akari came
 bursting through the door crying and hugged Kris like a life-line.

 &quot;Akari! What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Kris looked down at her cying friend/lover.

 &quot;I-I did it Kris. I dropped out of the University. We can be together.&quot;
 Akari lookd up to see a frowning Kris.

 Kris looked into Akari&#39;s light brown eyes,&quot;Did you do this just for me? I
 could never be happy if you didn&#39;t do this for yourself.&quot;

 &quot;No. I did it for myself Kris.&quot; Akari slowly wrapped her arms around
 Kris&#39;s waist, &quot;I made my mother happy by winning the title of Cosmo
 Beauty.&quot; Akari then got on her tips of her toes to get even closer to
 Kris&#39;s face, &quot;Now I want to be happy by us staying together. Please Kris,
 please stay with me.&quot;

 &quot;Oh Akari..... Yes I&#39;ll stay with you.&quot; and wth that, Kris brought her
 lips on to Akari&#39;s.

 They stayed like that for a while, til Akari tilted her head to the side
 to deepen their kiss, Kris slided her tounge into Akari&#39;s hot mouth, and
 was rewarded with a soft moan. Kris then reched for Akari&#39;s hips adn
 lifted her up, and akari wapped her legs around Kris to raised her body up
 to eve thier faces so they can kiss better.

 They stopped and looked into eachother&#39;s eyes, they knew what they wanted,
 and they weren&#39;t going to wait til night to do it.

 Kris reached with one hand to pull Akari&#39;s yellow hair-ribbon off when...

 (Knock!) (Knock!)

 Kris and Akari looked at the door, then at eachother as the untangle and
 straighten themselves out so they can open the door.

 &quot;Yes? Who is it?&quot; asked Kris, a little heavy-sounding from the
 pre-lovemaking they did.

 &quot;It&#39;s the University Administration, we have come to talk to Miss Kazaki.&quot;

 Kris looked back at Akari, and akari just shrugged her shoulders saying,&quot;I
 don&#39;t know.&quot;

 Kris opened the door as 2 people, (A man and a women) wearing high-ranked
 University Satellite uniforms walked in and stood in front of Akari.

 The male spoke first, &quot;Miss Kanzaki, a of today at 10:31 am UST
 (University Standred Tme) You forfeited your title of Cosmo Beauty to
 Lahrri by leaving the Satellite on unsatisfactory terms. We are here to
 take back the trophy and tiara.&quot;

 Akari didn&#39;t say one word and just gave a slght nod and pointed to her
 dresser where the trophy was and hanging on the trophy itself was the
 golden tiaria.

 Kris watched in shock as the female Admitistrator walked over to their
 dresser and picked up the two prized items and walked back to the door
 without a word. Akari just kept silent the whole time.

 The man then returned to the door and gave a short bow to the 2 girls,
 &quot;Thank you for your cooperation.&quot; And with that, the left the room.

 Kris just stared at the door for a full minute til she finally turned to
 Akari and aid, &quot;Y-Your serious, arn&#39;t you...&quot; This wasn&#39;t a question.

 &quot;Yes.&quot; Akari said, &quot;I&#39;ve done what mom wanted me to do. Now I was to do
 something for myself, like you said.&quot; Akari sighed, &quot;But I really wanted
 you to have that tiara Kris.&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s ok Akari, I love you more then that tiara. So it deosn&#39;t matter what
 they take from you or me.&quot; Akari walked up to Kris and laid her head on
 Kris&#39;s chest.

 &quot;Kris, let&#39;s just leave.&quot; said Akari, &quot;Take some money out of our
 accounts, and just leave.&quot;

 Kris looked down at her short lover, &quot;Where would we go?&quot;

 Akari looked up at Kris with a big smile, &quot;Back to my home in Hokkaido.
 Like I said last night in bed with you, we can stay there forever.&quot;

 Kris stood there in thought for a minute, then a smile slowly came across
 her face, &quot;Yes, I will stay with you Akari, but on one condtion.&quot;

 Akari asked &quot;what?&quot;, and Kris went to her suitcase and rummaged through it
 til she came across a small black box. She pick it up and walk over to
 Akari and got down on one knee and opened the box to place a gold ring on
 Akari&#39;s 3rd finger.

 &quot;Akari Kanzaki, will you marry me?&quot;, asked Kris.

 Akari was speechless, she just stood, then fresh tears fell down her face
 as she got on her knees and hugged Kris.

 &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll marry you.&quot; Kris was overcomed with joy as she held her
 soon-to-be-wife&#39;s hands.

 &quot;That&#39;s great, now stop crying and kiss me.&quot; Akari giggled and moved her
 face up to kiss her female husband.
