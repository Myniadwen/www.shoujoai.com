<h1>Bittersweet Chocolate</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../battle/index.html">Battle Athletes</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The photo album lay heavily in her lap. She knew it was silly, but she 
could almost imagine the weight of the memories within, pressing upon 
her, filling the pages with love, laughter, tears and hope. She pulled 
the cover back, listening to the creak of the old binding, smiling at 
the antique pages simply for their own sake. Her children made fun of 
her for this one fancy, this item so retroactive that it hadn&#39;t 
existed for many thousands of years even when she was young. 

Her fingers brushed lightly across the first few pictures, pictures 
she knew well, but could not remember. A beautiful face, with warm, 
happy eyes, beaming down at a child she knew to be herself. She 
flipped past holofilms of her childhood, past stills and scraps of 
media until she reached a specific page. Her hand lingered over a 
picture, then slowly fell to caress it. There she was, dear, kind 
Ichino, who had meant everything to her although she had never really 
understood. Akari laughed bitterly at her own lack of understanding. 
What was that saying? &quot;Youth is wasted on the young.&quot; Oh, Ichino, if 
only I had realized. I wasted so many years. 

If only she had realized so much - but then, it wouldn&#39;t have been a 
childhood, would it? She laughed at her own naivet&eacute;. She lifted the 
finger and took in the face that smiled back at her - cheerful, yet 
piercing and intense. Gazing at the photos on the two pages spread 
open before her, she noticed something she had never noticed before. 
There was Ichino running, swimming, jumping - every picture in action, 
a wild deer caught for a fleeting moment in mid-flight. Ichino was 
always in motion, waving, laughing, running...Akari smiled. And she 
had never changed, had she? Even as she waited for Akari to return, 
Ichino had been active, even when Akari returned as Cosmo Beauty, and 
after all too short and painful a time, had left again to be married. 
Ichino, who had waited for her for a very long time, never once 
stopped moving. Even after she took her vows, even after she abandoned 
them. Akari felt her chest clench. Spirits, why was she so stupid that 
she had to lose everything before she could see its true worth? 

More pages, more faces. Akari smiled at Tanya&#39;s hijinks in a short 
holoclip, and laughed out loud at Ling-Pha&#39;s mishaps. Life had been 
good to both of them, Akari knew. Tanya had eventually returned to 
Africa, and become a running coach to her enormous brood there, while 
Ling-Pha, having at last outgrown her own need to succeed at others&#39; 
cost, had focused on her far more impressive entrepreneurial skills on 
building her family&#39;s company. By all accounts she had been brilliant 
at doing just that. When Akari had last seen her, she was 
self-assured, confident and a little tyrannical, just as the matriarch 
of such a powerful family should have been. 

Another face. Ayla. She was the first to drop out, Akari remembered. 
It might have been the best thing in the world for her, but it was 
always difficult to read Ayla. After she was forced to leave the 
competition, Ayla turned away from sports, married had a child, but in 
the end returned as a coach in the Antarctic training facility where 
they had met. And thus far, three of the girls she had trained had 
gone on to the title of Cosmo Beauty. No, Ayla had done very well for 
herself, unlike Jessie. 

Akari&#39;s eyes filled with tears even as she gazed at the next picture. 
She had never been able to reach Jessie - not ever. After they had 
defeated the Nerilians, all those many years ago, Akari had never seen 
the woman in person again. But she had seen her face nearly 
everywhere. Jessie Gurtland, golden and shining, had turned her 
talents towards being the number one fashion model in the solar 
system. No one who had known her was surprised that she had taken the 
system by storm. But everyone was shocked when she disappeared shortly 
thereafter. When they found her, dead in a hotel from an overdose of 
pills, Akari had mourned deeply knowing that Jessie had never managed 
to see the light she dreamed of. Later, Akari learned that all of 
Jessie&#39;s not inconsiderable wealth had been left to a small church and 
orphanage in her hometown. In that moment, much of Jessie&#39;s life and 
death made sense. A tear fell onto the album and Akari brushed it away 
gently. Maybe Jessie had been able to see the light after all. 

She flipped past pages, until her fingers stopped flipping of their 
own accord. A small still photo, in black and white caught her 
attention. Three figures, her in the middle. The tears filled her eyes 
and made it hard to see now, but she did not move to brush them away. 
Today was a day for memories, and tears. To her left stood little 
Anna, smiling bashfully. Akari shook her head in wonder at the 
manipulative mother who had made something horrible out of an innocent 
desire. She wondered at Anna&#39;s innocence all over again, and all over 
again, forgave herself for not seeing the obvious. She had been an 
incredibly stupid child, hadn&#39;t she? She smiled sadly. How many people 
had she watched suffer and not really moved to help them? Anna, after 
her horrific defeat at Mylandah&#39;s hands had bounced back at least. 
Akari thought of the little girl and the cake shop she eventually 
opened. Seeing Anna truly happy had been a wonderful thing. Slowly, 
painfully, Akari tore her eyes from Anna&#39;s face and turned towards the 
other figure in the photo. Her chest felt both heavy and light as she 
regarded the large emerald eyes as they smiled happily at her from the 
album 

&quot;Oh, Kris,&quot; Akari said softly. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; 

She shook her head. If she had known then...one more clich&eacute; for the 
book. What she had done to Kris was unforgivable, Akari thought. But 
Kris had argued with her, and forgiven her. Still, for Akari, their 
friendship had a bittersweet taste. Even as she thought this, the 
priestess&#39; voice swam into her mind, along with a vision of Kris, as 
she knew she was now. For all the time and space between them, that 
special bond Kris had given her had never faded - a source of great 
joy and strength and, at times, a source of intense pain.

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Akari. First love is always painful. Haven&#39;t you 
forgiven yourself yet?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kris!&quot; Akari shouted and buried her face in her hands. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry we couldn&#39;t be together.&quot;

The image of Kris in her mind smiled, the lines in her face deepening 
with the motion. &quot;Don&#39;t be. It&#39;s so long ago, now. You&#39;re happy - I&#39;m 
happy. What&#39;s left to be sorry for?&quot; 

Akari sniffed, and looked up. &quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m acting like a child.&quot; 
She gave the other woman a small smile. &quot;Thank you. you always know 
how to cheer me up.&quot; 

Kris smiled happily and waved as she faded from sight, but Akari could 
feel the other woman&#39;s presence within her heart. Whatever Kris might 
say, Akari knew that she had been hurt deeply. She had sacrificed 
everything she believed in, everything she wanted, for Akari&#39;s sake. 
And for Akari, she had almost lost everything forever. When Kris had 
returned home to the moon, she had been called before an ecumenical 
council, investigated as a heretic and told she would never become a 
priestess. After their defeat of the Nerilians, when she had once 
again returned, she was allowed, with some reservation, to take her 
vows as a priestess. Akari knew that she was happy, that Kris had been 
happy for many years, but the pictures brought it all back again. 

More memories. Sadness and pleasure mixed inextricably in her 
thoughts. Another picture stopped her. A clipping from the year before 
she had gone to the satellite - how had this gotten in here? Two 
figures, watching other with intensity. Mylandah and Lahrri. Akari 
wondered that she had never seen it before - the hunger, the 
loneliness, the *need,* in that shared gaze. They had remained at the 
satellite for several years, after she had become Cosmo Beauty the 
first time, after it was repaired when the Nerilians left, but when it 
was apparent that neither one of them would ever rise again to the 
top, they had left. Living together - though never lovers, as some 
would have made them out to be - they had opened an athletic training 
facility of their own. And together, had produced several Cosmo 
Beauties. Then the fire had broken out. Lahrri was stuck inside - for 
all her strength, she was trapped by something as simple as a ceiling 
caving in and smoke. Mylandah was last seen alive making her way 
through the wreckage shouting Lahrri&#39;s name. When the fire was put 
out, and the ruins cleared, they were found, Lahrri&#39;s body held by 
Mylandah until asphyxiation had taken them both. Akari nodded to the 
memory of those two noble women. This past year a new wing had been 
added onto the University Satellite and named in their honor - a 
fitting remembrance to two of the finest athletes the system had ever 
seen. 

Pages passed by and memories floated to the surface. The bizarre time 
after she had won Cosmo Beauty, when the Nerillians attacked, 
demanding that the System defend itself in a series of athletic 
events, learning that her coach and her father were one and the same, 
meeting, and defeating her mother at her peak of performance...the 
even bizarrer times when she left home to be married, have children, 
and retire from sports, almost exactly like her mother before her.

Another picture. This one a holograph of a golden statue, as radiant 
on the page as it was in real life. Her mother, the magnificent Tomoe 
Midou, glowing with the light that had profoundly moved thousands of 
people...and that she, Tomoe&#39;s own daughter had never seen until she 
was forced to compete against her.. For the millionth time, Akari 
wondered why her mother had never run when she had been a child. And 
she wondered why she had never resented this woman, this memory, this 
icon, when she had shared so much of herself with everyone else in the 
solar system, but not with her only child. For the millionth time, 
Akari came to the conclusion that it was she, Tomoe&#39;s daughter, who 
had seen the real woman...and that running was just something that 
she...did.

Akari nodded. Just as she had come to realize for herself. Cosmo 
Beauty was not what she was - just what she did. It had taken her 
years, decades, in fact, to understand that and to come back once 
again to teach that simple fact to others. So there would be no more 
Jessies, no more Mylandahs, no more broken girls dashed on a dream of 
perfection. Akari lifted her eyes to the screen in front of her, 
remembering the arguments that had broken out when Grant Oldman 
reappeared after years of absence, when he had argued that the title 
of Cosmo Beauty should not die out with the threat of the Nerilians 
gone. She smiled as she remembered her father - and her resurrected 
mother, then pregnant - arguing forcibly for the renewal of University 
Satellite. And the smile spread when she remembered Ichino and 
herself, Kris and so many of the others standing before the board and 
insisting that the training for Cosmo Beauty had made them appreciate 
everything they had ever had, everything they had ever accomplished 
and everything they had lost. The Satellite had been rebuilt on one 
condition...

There was the noise of the door opening behind her. A voice spoke 
harshly, its accent not at all dulled by time and distance. &quot;Hey, 
Akari! Aren&#39;t you ready yet? The ceremony&#39;s about to start.&quot; 

Akari closed the album and laid it on the desk. She spun the chair 
around and looked up into a face hardly changed by age. Ichino&#39;s short 
hair was now more silver than black, but her eyes were still bright, 
although softened with many experiences. More than ever, she reminded 
Akari of a deer running. Ichino stared back, her head cocked. &quot;What 
are you thinking?&quot; 

Akari smiled ruefully. &quot;About what an idiot I was as a child. Why 
didn&#39;t you hit me more often?&quot; 

Ichino held out a hand to help Akari up from her seat. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t 
have helped...you were a total blockhead,&quot; she laughed. 

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Akari reached out and took the hand, not letting go of 
it when she was on her feet. Stepping close to Ichino she said 
quietly, &quot;Thank you for waiting for me to figure it out.&quot; 

Ichino laid a hand along Akari&#39;s cheek. &quot;I always did - and then, you 
always surpassed me. Every time.&quot; She leaned forward and kissed the 
other woman lightly on the lips. Pulling away, Ichino grinned. Without 
the trace of an accent, she said formally, &quot;And now, Headmistress, 
it&#39;s time for you to welcome the new students.&quot; Ichino backed away and 
gestured towards the door.

Akari took a moment, breathed deeply and nodded. &quot;Right! Are they 
energetic this year?&quot; 

Ichino laughed. &quot;Oh, boy are they ever!&quot; 

With a shake of her body, the Headmistress of the University Satellite 
stepped out to greet the newest class in the quest for the title of 
Cosmo Beauty.
