<h1>Ibuki's Gift (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sfighter/index.html">Street Fighter</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ravenest.html">Ravenest</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sfighter/ibukigift-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>With his claw he shredded more and more from Bison&#146;s suit, it was 
incredibly tough though and his claw barely managed to slice through 
after several strikes. Bison laughed while getting free hits from 
Vega&#146;s attempts to injure the suit. He always hit where it hurts, with 
his knees, elbows or feet. Suddenly their feet met in a fierce series 
of kicks, his right foot was still injured from Cammy&#146;s mouth and 
Bison frowned in agony as the pain multiplied. 

&quot;What&#146;s the matter fatty? Got a weak spot there?&quot; Vega said coldly 
from under his mask and kicked down to stomp on the foot again. &quot;Life 
can be such a bitch, here you are enjoying yourself in your pretty 
little castle, and then you had to meet me.&quot; 

As Vega once again made a slash for his face Bison blocked with his 
arm and sent a jolt of psycho power throwing his former minion into a 
nearby wall. Vega wasn&#146;t late to react though, he landed against the 
wall with his feet, pushed and made a Barcelona slash after connecting 
with his opponent. Bison grabbed his arm&#146;s though the ninja countered 
with leaning forward (basically standing on Bison&#146;s shoulders.) and 
then rolling into an above position. Vega laughed and began slashing 
madly at Bison&#146;s face. 

&quot;I&#146;ve heard you always hurt those you love&#133;&quot; Another slash sliced 
Bison&#146;s left cheek leaving a terrible wound. &quot;&#133;But for you I&#146;ll make 
an exception.&quot; 

&quot;Fool!&quot; The one still in charge of Shadowlaw growled and sent another 
rush of psycho power into his opponent&#39;s body. Vega was unprepared for 
this and was hurled back again. As soon as he stood up he found Bison 
descending over him with his hard feet aiming for the former 
bullfighter&#146;s head. &quot;When I am done with you you&#146;ll have to sell your 
internal organs just to pay for the medical bill.&quot; 

&quot;Good one, my turn&#133;&quot; 

&quot;No, you&#146;re finished pathetic weakling!&quot; Bison growled as he lifted 
the weakened body of Vega into the air. &quot;No one can withstand my 
superior Psycho Crusher!&quot; 

&quot;Vega!&quot; A familiar voice suddenly cried. Vega thought about if or a 
while, he was soon to be dead anyway. It was the first time he had 
heard something other than &quot;YES SIR&quot; or &quot;AFFIRMITIVE!&quot; from one of the 
clones. Sure they would say &quot;MISSION COMPLETE, SIR!&quot; every once in a 
while too, but anyway. The former matador found it ironic that she 
would develop a fairly human language just before it would be crushed 
again by Bison&#146;s psycho power. He hoped that Juni would be smart 
enough to run away after watching him being killed as well. Maybe 
getting her own life and&#133; 

There was a series of shooting. Bison loosened his grip and staggered 
away from the nearly unconscious Vega. It sounded almost like&#133; 

There was a series of fire again. 

&quot;Armor shells? Who the hell gave you access to those?&quot; Bison said in 
grief as he watched his suit all torn to shreds and his chest having 
light flesh wounds underneath. The plated suit had barely saved his 
life but it still hurt like hell. 

&quot;Nevermind that you bitch! Just wait and I&#146;ll crush you with my 
Psycho&#133; poooohhhhhwer&#133;&quot; He gasped as Vega&#146;s claw appeared at the front 
of his chest from inside. His revival mechanism exploded and instead 
damaged Bison&#146;s heart severely. 

&quot;It&#146;s good to have friends eh?&quot; Vega whispered as he swiftly pulled 
the claw out and let Bison fall to the floor in front of him. &quot;I bet 
you never were very popular in high school. Who else would clone 
himself to get friends?&quot; 

Bison laughed at his defeat and informed his assassins that he was 
prepared for such an event. He had, in his hand, a device that would 
destroy the entire building two seconds after he pushed the button. 

&quot;Cheap shot Bison. Juni?&quot; One last shot was fired and tearing Bison&#146;s 
hand off. The cruel leader of the Shadowlaw organization died with a 
weak laughter. He didn&#146;t seem to notice that he was unable to press 
the button. 

&quot;My last boss tried the same thing, and look where I am now.&quot; Vega 
said and took the time to throw his head back and laugh loudly. 

In the door leading to the hallway he suddenly noticed a large 
character though. It was Sagat dressed in his usual fighting outfit, 
which wasn&#39;t much. Vega knew he wouldn&#146;t endure another battle but got 
into his stance anyway. 

&quot;Well that&#146;s that. You really thought you would get away with this?&quot; 
The large man said with a dark voice. Vega didn&#146;t answer so he 
continued. &quot;As of the usual gangster rules, the one who kills the 
leader will take his place right? I&#146;ll just tell you this, the fucker 
wouldn&#146;t let me have a rematch against Ryu, and if you hadn&#146;t killed 
him I would, sooner or later. Since I would have been here as soon as 
I heard the lock down of this section and kicked your ass into the 
stone age, if I followed my instructions that is, I want to make a 
deal. I bet you won&#146;t mind if I go pummel the little fella for the 
rest of my life yes?&quot;

Vega was still trying to think of something to say. He was extremely 
high from the adrenaline pumping through his veins. However he now 
noticed that Sagat had grabbed and unarmed his favorite clone, Juni. 

&quot;This isn&#146;t a try for blackmail right? Because if so, you would have 
killed her before you bothered talking, and threaten to kill the rest 
of them right?&quot; Vega said coldly and waved for Juni to get loose and 
come to him. She did as he wanted and Sagat let her go. 

&quot;Wrong, what&#146;s it gonna be, her or me?&quot; Sagat asked then smiling 
mischievously. 

&quot;Hey were pals right?&quot; Vega said taking his mask of revealing a large 
smile. &quot;And besides, I wanted to kick that bitch Chun-Li&#146;s ass ever 
since that time she knocked me out of her apartment, being FOUR FLOORS 
high, THROUGH A WALL. So you can say I understand how you feel. Go 
boy, kick his ass and make us proud!&quot; (What Vega actually meant with 
the last part was: Leave me alone with the chicks so I can rule this 
place.) 

Sagat smiled. &quot;Fine, and if I ever beat him, I will come back for 
you.&quot; He pointed at the floor. &quot;I mean, you killed the boss after all. 
HmhmhmhheheeheehHAHAHAHA!!!&quot; The large Thaiboxer was still laughing 
loudly when he left the room.

Vega suddenly noticed Juli tightly hugging him with some joy in her 
eyes. Still looking fake and stiff but he enjoyed it anyway. &quot;Let&#146;s 
see how your comrade is doing.&quot; He said while putting his mask back on 
and then lifting Bison&#146;s heavy body. 

*** 


Ibuki kissed her hard-earned girlfriend when they dropped onto 
Sakura&#39;s bed. Then placing a strawberry chewing gum into her mouth, as 
she didn&#146;t like smoking after sex. Chewing slowly she stroked Sakura&#146;s 
hair while looking at her breathing peacefully. It was obvious that 
she was all but unconscious from exhaustion. But Ibuki was happy she 
had managed to pleasure her lover without caring too much about 
herself. She was a bit frustrated only getting one small orgasm, but 
it had to do because she valued her girlfriend and didn&#146;t want to 
strain her too much. Suddenly she could hear a car park outside the 
house and she was painfully reminded of Sakura&#146;s parents. 

&quot;Sheisse!&quot; She hissed. &quot;HURRY HURRY HURRY!&quot; Ibuki thought in panic. In 
ultra speed she scraped up every piece of glass from the floor and put 
them in her pouch. Then as she was about to jump, after putting a 
quilt on her sleeping beauty, she noticed the broken window. Looking 
around outside she noticed the other houses that were all similar to 
Sakura&#39;s. She bounced down to the ground, quickly snatched one, and 
then jumped back again. The ninja scraped of the remaining glass still 
stuck in the window and put it away while finding her super ninja glue 
(Used when scaling ceilings and walls) and then spraying it along the 
edge. 

&quot;Lucky for me the houses around here are of the same design, as they 
should use the same windows. God how clever I am!&quot; Ibuki thought to 
herself and placed the window into the hole where it fitted well. 

Then another thought struck her. 

&quot;The glue won&#146;t dry for another five minutes.&quot; (It dries at a slow 
pace making it possible for the user to move around and adjust the 
strength to their weight and muscles, so they won&#146;t get stuck. Water 
is used to halt the effect when the strength of the glue is enough.) 
Ibuki frowned and a large tear appeared next to her head.  And she 
couldn&#146;t stand there all day! Dressed in just her black panties and 
shirt. WHAT WOULD SAKURA&#146;S PARENTS SAY??? 

&quot;Think fast Ibuki, you&#146;ve been through worse. Even Eiji would laugh if 
he saw you know. He would know what to do. Think, think, think!&quot; The 
she was reminded of her chewing gum. &quot;Of course. Ibuki, you ARE a 
genius.&quot; She said to herself while giggling heavily. She took the gum 
out of her mouth and placed it at the corners and the swiftly bounced 
out of view as Sakura&#146;s parents got into the room. 

All this happened in about 53 seconds time. 

*** 

&quot;Sakura? Sakura!&quot; 

&quot;Mmmmwhat is it Ibuki?&quot; 

Sakura&#146;s mom looked strangely at her. 

&quot;Oh MOM. Where&#146;s&#133;&quot; She looked around the room. &quot;I mean glad you&#146;re 
home. I had such a wonderful dream, and, uhm, Ibuki was sort of in 
it.&quot; Sakura smiled. 

&quot;I just wanted to know if you wanted dinner now that we are home.&quot; Her 
mom asked and patted her forehead. &quot;How are you feeling dear, oh 
you&#146;re all hot. Do you have a fever??&quot; She said worriedly. 

Sakura sighed and then saw Ibuki peeking into the room. She waved, 
pointed at her wrist and shrugged her shoulders. Sakura waved for her 
to wait and coughed slightly. &quot;Uhm, yes. I think I got the flue and I 
know we were going to the movies later and all&#133;&quot; 

&quot;The flue, well of course you can&#146;t go! You&#146;re staying home tonight 
whether you like it or not!&quot; Sakura&#146;s mom said. &quot;I can see you have 
fever by just looking at you, all red and sweaty, poor thing. Mom is 
going get some soup for you okay? And then you try to sleep ok?&quot; 

&quot;Tonite?&quot; Ibuki formed with her lips. 

Sakura nodded and showed seven fingers while pretending to stretch 
out. Ibuki made the V sign and air kissed her lover before dropping 
down the balcony and disappearing. 

*** 

&quot;Well, well, Juni, looks like we did it.&quot; Vega said trying to snap out 
of the excitement as they walked down the corridor that led to the 
med-center. &quot;Let&#146;s go tell your comrades, I am worried about July.&quot; 

He enjoyed Juni&#146;s soft body against him as she held him like he was 
some kind of hero. 

&quot;That&#146;s a pretty thought.&quot; He said to himself. He imagined all the 
kinds of things he could use the girls for and he nearly drooled from 
excitement as images, one better than the other, popped up in his 
mind. He hurried down the next hall while dragging Bison&#146;s corpse with 
him with less difficulty. 

Vega could hear a violent discussion from the large clone area as he 
passed it. He could as well pass by while on the way the ninja 
thought. 

&quot;Well, well, if it isn&#146;t doctor Kirk.&quot; Vega said as he stormed through 
the door making a rather dramatic entrance. &quot;Still working late I see, 
always the last to be around. Tell me, do you ever take coffee 
breaks?&quot; 

The light haired doctor faced him and with a cool look in his eyes 
Kirk took a short pause in his work. &quot;Actually I was going to but 
somebody threw some work at me so here I am. What do you want?&quot; He 
said with frustration in his voice. 

Vega threw the lifeless body of his former boss at him and looked 
around. &quot;I am just checking by my new friends. How many do you have?&quot; 

&quot;What? That&#146;s disgusting! How repulsive! Get him out of here!&quot; Kirk 
said harshly and didn&#146;t seem to care much about his boss being shot 
and ripped to shreds, what did bother him was having corpses thrown at 
him. 

&quot;Easy man, I&#146;ll bring him with me later. It&#146;s not like he is going 
anywhere. He he heh&#133; And so, if you still want your pay, you better 
recognize your new boss.&quot; Vega said giving the scientist a superior 
look. 

&quot;Yeah, yeah whatever. Ever since I got into cloning and genetics no 
one respects me anyway. The third energy was a much more stimulating 
and inspired project.&quot; Kirk whined as he got back to work. 

&quot;Juni, release whatever clones you can find and inform them of our 
status. I&#146;ll have a little chat with our friendly doctor here.&quot; Vega 
said and lifted his arm above his head making a superior pose out of 
pure egoism. &quot;Oh, and take whatever time you need.&quot; 

&quot;YES SIR!&quot; Juni said coldly and began releasing the locks to the 
chambers. 

&quot;So doc, what are you working on?&quot; The former matador asked and leaned 
over Kirk&#146;s shoulder. &quot;Another clone? Some kind of biohazard? A 
DINOSAUR maybe?&quot; He asked and finished with a sinister laugh. 

&quot;No, now if you must know I am rebuilding the tissues on this clone 
here. She has obviously been repeatedly injured by some sort of blunt 
weapon for a very long time. A cane or rod maybe&#133; It seems she has 
been on the verge of starving for a long time too and so I, as the 
head &#145;doc&#146; of this place, got the job to fix her up.&quot; 

In front of the arrogant but skilled scientist there was some sort of 
cryo chamber. The glass was too misty to look through on any other 
place than the one that Kirk was working on. However it was obvious to 
Vega that Cammy had been left off here instead of the med-section. 

&quot;Where&#146;s the one that left her here? She was supposed to get back and 
bring some of the clones with her.&quot; Vega asked trying to get through 
to the occupied doctor. Once again Kirk took a pause in his work. 

&quot;Hmmm, oh that one. She asked to release the clones but didn&#146;t bring 
papers of its&#39; approval so I shut her down. Obviously the mental 
barrier had broken since she was talking strangely. She&#146;s over there, 
now if you&#146;ll excuse me.&quot; Kirk pointed to a chair some yards away and 
got back to his work. 

Vega got to the chair and found July sitting limply and starring with 
lifeless eyes. &quot;Activate.&quot; He said and immediately July awoke brushing 
her brown hair looking with confused eyes around the room. 

&quot;Mission failed. Amount of time loss, 15:07:105. Estimated time of 
shut down, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. Cause of failure: deactivation. 
&#133; &#133; I&#146;m sorry&#133;&quot; She said with a robotic voice. However the last part 
had a touch to it that almost sounded human. Vega was surprised, as 
they would normally stop there. Sorry??? 

&quot;Get up, no need to be sorry. New objective.&quot; July&#146;s eyes seemed to 
get lit with these words. If he didn&#146;t know that they couldn&#146;t Vega 
would bet his head that she was smiling. He began talking with an 
accurate and somewhat robotic voice himself. Now he would have some 
fun. 

&quot;Ok, rules are simple, make 2 groups and secure the building. I leave 
the COA to you and if mission should fail secure clone 22 and Dr. Kirk 
then meet me at the airport. Got it?&quot; 

&quot;YES SIR!&quot; 

Vega started to feel like a real general. Oh, he forgot the last part. 
&quot;Ok girls lets beat the record. You got ten minutes!&quot; 

&quot;Yes SIR!&quot; Juni and July said simultaneously as July stood up after 
recording the speech. She hurried to help Juni release the chamber 
locks containing the other clones. 

&quot;I see, starting a private little war here.&quot; Dr. Kirk snarled. 

&quot;Yes of course.&quot; Vega said. &quot;And everyone who helps me will be 
rewarded.&quot; 

&quot;I am glad for your sake that you intend to get me out of here if 
things should turn sour. Well as long as I got my lab I will be happy. 
However, do you really think anyone with an IQ over 15 is going to 
believe that crap?&quot; The good doctor said sarcastically while slamming 
his tools into a board beside him. 

&quot;It&#146;s okay, I&#146;ll buy you a new one if that&#146;ll keep you loyal.&quot; Vega 
snarled back at him. &quot;So just go do your damn job!&quot;

Vega walked around in the lab for a while and finally sat down in the 
chair where July had been sitting before and took time in making 
himself comfortable. &quot;Tell me when number 22, I mean Cammy, is ready, 
I had a rough day.&quot; 

He finished then starting a small monitor next to him. He pushed the 
button for &quot;hentai&quot; and chose &quot;Hard&quot;. A scene from &quot;Cool Devices part 
11&quot; popped up but he quickly turned it off as he found it absolutely 
repulsive by the end of the second minute of watching it. He clicked 
again and chose &quot;Soft.&quot;. A scene with two computer game characters 
known as Tifa and Yuffie in the middle of a lesbian act replaced the 
other one. 

&quot;Oooh, now that&#146;s more like it! I wonder where Bison got these 
anyway.&quot; A perverted idea  was taking shape in Vega&#146;s resting mind. 
&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; He said to himself and smiled mischievously. 

&quot;Hey fatty, just wait until you see my new spy program! Wait, what did 
you say? Oh you&#146;re dead? Well too bad, that means you&#146;re gonna miss 
everything. GAHAHAHAHAHA!!!&quot; 

Dr. Kirk was only slightly amused by his new boss&#146;s sense of humor. 
What was on his mind at this moment was getting rid of the corpse and 
finish this clone&#146;s fixing so he could get the hell out of there and 
have a cup of coffee. 

*** 

Halfway through the small forest, that was the shortcut between hers 
and Sakura&#146;s house Ibuki sat down next to a tree. She was exhausted 
and barely had the energy to move. 

&quot;I better rest up for a while. Then maybe find a lake or take a shower 
and hope that Eiji won&#146;t see me.&quot; She felt her sweaty skin lick 
against the insides of her clothes and wondered how she got to be so 
exhausted. Probably her quality time with Sakura helped. She climbed 
up the tree and found a place to sit as the ground was getting on her 
nerves being cold, wet and having hundreds of ants. 

She had some time by herself and got to think her situation over. Of 
course she had no regrets. The thing she worried most about was 
whether she would grow tired of it once it was a part of her everyday 
life and what Sakura&#146;s parents and Eiji would say. 

Ibuki straightened her shirt and pants then jumped over to the next 
tree with the skill of a flying squirrel. On her shoulder the bag she 
carried her bag with her clothes and souvenir; Sakura&#39;s panties that 
she had forgot to return. Ibuki had no intention to return them 
however. 

&quot;I&#146;ll make it home before dinner if I hurry.&quot; She thought and swiftly 
jumped to the next tree her toes barely touching the last one. &quot;God, 
I&#146;m hungry.&quot; 

*** 

&quot;All right everybody listen up!&quot; Vega cried as he had the clones storm 
the monitor room. He lifted Bison&#146;s dead body with one hand and threw 
it into the center of the room. &quot;This is a riot, that I already won, 
so if anyone has anything to say you better say it now because things 
are about to change!&quot; 

There was no reaction. Some of the people at the monitor surveillance 
section looked at him and the body that had landed closest to them. 
Then they turned around and started working again. 

&quot;What the hell is this??? HEY there, I killed Bison; I&#146;m the boss 
here! Are you listening???&quot; A new member of the spy-cam section moved 
up to him and whispered.

&quot;I think they are used to this. You have to remember that all these 
people are used to this kind of thing to happen, I mean, they are all 
bad guys, like yourself right? The only thing that will upset them is 
if you would go personal and kill someone from a gang or something.&quot; 
He tried. 

&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Vega replied coldly and turned to the clones. &quot;July 
kill that person and let&#146;s see what happens.&quot; 

&quot;Hey no don&#146;t, argh!&quot; The youngster cried as she opened fire. 

There was a large tumult in the room and many left their work to find 
out what was happening. The spy-cam group looked angrily at Vega as 
they recognized their comrade. 

&quot;Now, seems like I finally got your attention you worthless sons of 
bitches.&quot; Vega said and pointed at a random guy. &quot;July shoot him too, 
I don&#146;t like the look on his face.&quot; 

There was another salvo and a shriek. 

The personnel were getting really worried but didn&#146;t know what to do 
as armed clones surrounded them. Many raised their hands in 
desperation. Vega laughed as he watched them look around in horror and 
he was wondering what they would ultimately try to do. 

&quot;Vega&#133;&quot; July said suddenly. &quot;That person&#133; he&#146;s&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Shut up while I&#146;m talking.&quot; Vega said ignoring her while point into 
the room. &quot;Yes I am talking to you scumbags! I&#146;ll say this only once. 
I&#146;ll run the Shadowlaw now. And I want order, straight lines and all 
that crap every dictator asks for. Free speech is a privilege, not a 
right. More power to me, and&#133; and&#133; free coffee to everyone!&quot; 

The last part gave a huge cheer despite the recent killings. 

&quot;Are you going to lie there all day? Come on, they didn&#146;t hit that 
hard.&quot; Vega said to the man that Juli had shot at first. The clone was 
confused and checked her gun&#146;s capacity. It had been point blank and 
all. 

&quot;Don&#146;t worry, they are not real men to be unable to take some beating 
of rubber bullets. Get up you weakling, never had bruises before?&quot; He 
said evilly and then looked up. &quot;And you over there, you should take 
the commando course if you hope to survive here.&quot; 

The recent &quot;kills&quot; stood up with awful bruises over their bodies. July 
looked in her clip and found round pink rubber balls in it. She got 
confused but soon forgot about it as she could hear her friends cheer 
again as Vega asked them to. 

&quot;Viva la Vega!&quot; He said and took Bison&#146;s seat in the middle of the 
room. &quot;However the one who touches Juni&quot; She smiled. &quot;&#133;Or July.&quot; 
Rivalry. &quot;&#133;will die muffled by their own ass. And I won&#39;t use rubber 
balls next time.&quot; 

Vega leaned back in the very comfortable chair and quickly disabled 
the self-destruction sequence that started as he sat down by pulling 
the entire mechanism out and throwing it to the floor. He had always 
lived thinking violence can solve anything and so far he had always 
been right. Vega didn&#146;t notice the new rivalry between Juni and July 
as they were looking with hate in their eyes at each other. 

&quot;So what&#146;s on the schedule?&quot; He then asked looking at the personnel 
return to their stations again still a bit shaken but loyal none the 
less. 

&quot;A simple observation mission. Lord Bison&#133; I mean&#133; the red fatty 
wanted us to try out the clones observation capabilities and maybe 
replace the old observation droids.&quot; A female engineer hissed for an 
answer just before Vega was about to ask again. 

&quot;Hmm I see. That&#146;s why he wanted me to get Juni and July for him.&quot; 
Vega thought. He noticed the two clones new rivalry going physical and 
they were starting a fight behind him. 

&quot;What the&#133; JUNI, JULY! I order you to stop that nonsense at once, 
what&#146;s with you anyway? I got an observ&#133;&quot; 

&quot;YES SIR!&quot; 

&quot;Oh well, just like kiss and make up ok?&quot; He sighed and looked at his 
other now more relaxed allies again. &quot;And you, what&#39;s your name?&quot; He 
asked the engineer in front of him. 

&quot;Specter sir.&quot; She replied. She had odd features such as red her, 
narrow eyes and an almost demonic pair of sharp teeth reminding him of 
some character he had seen in some anime a while ago. 

&quot;Specter eh?&quot; He said and studied her some more. &quot;What kind of name is 
that?&quot; 

&quot;Uhm&#133; its my net name.&quot; She replied with a whisper looking like she 
had to consider it for a while. &quot;The real name is Blame...&quot; As if to 
distract him she pointed towards a spot behind him and he turned 
around realizing she had a good reason for it. 

On the floor were the two clones he favored rolling around and 
entwined as if they were wrestling trying to dominate the other. But 
in addition to just fighting they were kissing, as if it was a martial 
art or something. This event made Vega gasp and remain speechless for 
a few seconds before he got to his senses. Growling under the muffled 
moans of the two he made a mind note to fix that &#39;bug&#39; that made them 
take everything so literally. 

&quot;All right!&quot; He growled. &quot;Break it up you two!&quot; 

Of course he couldn&#39;t be soft on them it would be bad to spoil them 
and he didn&#39;t want that. He might want to put a camera in their 
quarters for later though. As they finally broke up and stood uneasily 
next to each other Vega ordered the other girls to grab them and keep 
them off each other. 

&quot;What will I do with you two now?&quot; He asked himself after walking back 
and forth. &quot;Of course the observation mission. Specter, hand me the 
details.&quot; His outstretched hand received a small document. 

Looking it through while Juni and July struggled to get loose he 
didn&#39;t say anything. It was strange however as the usually so soulless 
dolls suddenly were so hard to control. Normally they would just stand 
around and wait for their next order but these two had something going 
that it seemed they would try to finish at any given moment when they 
weren&#39;t executing an order. Maybe they would be best tested first? He 
closed the document and handed it to Blame again. 

&quot;Your target is&#133;&quot; He looked at the large monitor that was currently 
tracing the girl it had before Bison left. &quot;That girl! Find her and 
test her skills. Heheheh&#133; ALL her skills.&quot; 

Juni and July looked at the screen behind him and smiled 
simultaneously then looked at each other with dark eyes. The other 
girls had to team up three&#39;s on each to stop them from getting too 
close to one another. 

&quot;I saw that!&quot; Vega commented and turned around quickly. &quot;This mission 
requires you to work together, and do it well. You can start your 
thing again, whatever it is, when you get back.&quot; 

The duo stopped with a &quot;Yes SIR!&quot; and eased under their bondage. 

&quot;Ok, release them and take them to the spot.&quot; He said and waved. &quot;Use 
the aircraft if you think it&#39;s faster.&quot; And they were on their way. 
Looking into the hallway were his allies had left Vega sighed and 
turned around facing his new &#39;assistant&#39;. 

&quot;Now, Specter was it?&quot; He asked rhetorically with a smile. &quot;Would you 
be kind enough to bring me a cup of coffee? I believe we have some 
things to discuss.&quot; 

&quot;Sure&#133;&quot; The woman whispered and was on her way. 

***

Ibuki gasped as the trees suddenly started waving to some very strong 
winds from above. And with the wind followed a deafening sound, just 
like a large aircraft. They wouldn&#39;t fly this close to the ground 
would they? But as the ninja girl moved to a better spot and noticed a 
large black airship hovering above her. She didn&#39;t recognize the 
design but there was a strange symbol on one of the wings that she 
knew from somewhere. Things where to get more interesting however as a 
door on the side opened and someone hanging on to a rope of some sort 
jumped out. 

It looked like a semi blond woman and she untied the rope and sent it 
upwards again then looking around. Ibuki crawled down to get a closer 
look and with the strong winds the trees had turned unsafe on her.  
Maybe she should sneak after her? Or maybe she should run away and 
tell Eiji about it. Of course, only one should be easy enough. 

 &quot;I see her, Delta formation at three!&quot; Someone suddenly cried and 
Ibuki felt that someone land hard on her back and pushing her down. 

&quot;Target found, commencing primary objective.&quot; Juni said with a 
metallic voice. 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Ibuki said pulling herself free after some 
trouble. The one standing on her got off quickly enough and walked up 
to her partner. 

&quot;I could take you out right here and right now, but to be honest I am 
a little curious about your objectives.&quot; Ibuki said as it was obvious 
the girls were after her. &quot;Tell me and I might give you a swift death, 
if not I&#146;ll have to force it out of you!&quot; 

&quot;Ouch, such harsh talk from such a sweet girl.&quot; July commented looking 
at Ibuki&#146;s outfit and wet skin. &quot;Very hot out here yes?&quot; 

&quot;Oh&#133;&quot; Ibuki blushed and lowered her guard for a second. She then got 
into her stance again and looked angrily at them. &quot;I understand you 
are not going to give in by your own free will?&quot; 

&quot;That is correct.&quot; Juni replied. &quot;We are here to measure your skills.&quot; 

&quot;Fine by me!&quot; Ibuki said in frustration and lashed at her. &quot;Too bad 
you won&#146;t get away with any information on this one!&quot; 

Juni barely managed to block the sword with her arm pad. 

&quot;Status, damaged 10% right pad, evaluation: fast-draw sword 
technique.&quot; 

Ibuki pushed Juni&#146;s arm away with the sword and landed a punch against 
her cheek. The clone dodged but feel to the ground. July immediately 
attacked Ibuki from the other side. The ninja blocked with her arm and 
kicked with her right leg. July stumbled and received an elbow to her 
stomach. 

&quot;Know what?&quot; Ibuki said sarcastically and was about to finish off the 
second clone. &quot;You guys don&#39;t even deserve a cool oneliner!&quot; 

&quot;Counter ability, 90, current move: deadly but useless.&quot; Juni said 
coldly. Kicking up from the ground she got to her feet. July blocked 
the sword and allowed her counterpart to grab Ibuki from behind and 
suplex her. 

&quot;Throw resistance 10%.&quot; She said and tried attacking Ibuki as she 
rolled out of the way. &quot;Ground control 85%.&quot; 

&quot;Will you stop that you babbling drones! I&#146;ll finish you both and we 
can see about abilities then!&quot; Ibuki growled and rolled to her feet. 
&quot;As a wise man once said, honor is best discussed over the body of 
your opponent.&quot; 

She had both clones in front of her. She put the sword to her mouth 
and shuriken&#146;s between every finger, 4 all in all. They just looked at 
her. As if they were monitoring her, or maybe trying to evaluate her 
next moves. 

&quot;Calculating possible outcome.&quot; Juni said getting into her stance. 

Ibuki shot out and elbowed Juni who immediately blocked. She continued 
with a reverse spin kick that caught the other clone&#146;s neck. Ibuki 
used her weight to push July to the ground and then threw the stars in 
her right hand at Juni while pushing her knee into July&#146;s side. 

&quot;Very advanced maneuver. Unable to verify.&quot; Juni said looking at the 
stars stuck in her arm pad. After pulling them out she grabbed Ibuki&#146;s 
arm, as she was about to stab her clone co-worker. 

&quot;Ngh&#133; Strength and resistance, a&#133; a 98&#133; nngghh&#133;&quot; She moaned she Ibuki 
was much stronger than the light haired clone has expected. Juni 
looked down at her ally who was busy fending Ibuki&#39;s other arm off and 
nodded. 

&quot;Blocking capability 21%.&quot; July growled and attacked. 

&quot;Ungh!!!&quot; With Juni suddenly twisting her wrist Ibuki dropped the 
sword as well. The clone lifted her to a standing position and grabbed 
her other arm. In this painful position Ibuki could not do much and 
she had to start considering options other than sheer violence. 

&quot;Resistance is futile!&quot; July said and slapped the ninja. She picked up 
the sword and held it in front of the ninja. &quot;Pretty short fight, I&#146;d 
say your ability is about 700, which is a little less than average.&quot; 

&quot;Screw you!&quot; Ibuki snarled and spat at the clone&#146;s face. She felt her 
muscles tiring the more she struggled and the woman behind her wasn&#39;t 
exactly being nice to her trapped arm either. 

&quot;Yeah, that would be interesting.&quot; July said suddenly changing her 
tone of voice drastically. Instead of the stiff robotic voice it was 
now very sweet and sounded more human. She put the sword on Ibuki&#39;s 
shirt between her breasts. 

&quot;New objective.&quot; She said and moved it up and down while starting to 
lick her lips slowly informing Ibuki just what she had in mind. &quot;We&#146;ll 
test your OTHER abilities.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s repulsive!&quot; Ibuki growled and struggled to get loose.

&quot;I think not.&quot; Said Juni from behind the ninja. &quot;My sensors show that 
you are already stimulated.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because of&#133;&quot; Ibuki stopped there. She didn&#39;t want to involve 
Sakura in this. She was still all wet and excited from their time 
together so the clone was right in that she was excited but it wasn&#39;t 
exactly.

&quot;Please stand still.&quot; July said and moved the small sword backwards 
before pushing it forward moving the blade at an impossible speed 
mimicking a move she had seen in anime once. Ibuki screamed from fear.
