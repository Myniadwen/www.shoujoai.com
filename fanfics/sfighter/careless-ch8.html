~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

By the time Elena had reached Narumi&#39;s house, the thunder and lightning 
had kicked off again. There was no rain. But it made the search for 
Narumi... unnerving. Thunder and lightning were the two facets of nature 
that Elena had trouble in accepting. But when she saw that Narumi was 
gone, she went to look for the Japanese girl. At first she looked around 
in the precinct of the festival. When the search of the carnival came up 
fruitless, Elena moved out to check in the nearby areas. And when Elena 
still couldn&#39;t find Narumi; she actually started to get worried. What if 
something bad had happened to Narumi? The African girl shuddered to 
think of it. The first thing she did in her urgency was back step and 
head for Narumi&#39;s house. If she wasn&#39;t there; then Elena would probably 
have to do something drastic. But fortunately, she was there. Elena 
opened the door and called out for the girl in the downstairs hallway. 
There was no reply. But what she did see was Narumi&#39;s keys, hung on the 
key hook beside the doorway. Elena could tell they belonged to Narumi 
from the little Usagi key chain. That meant she was home. 

Elena quickly checked the kitchen and the living room to see if Narumi 
was there.

She wasn&#39;t.

So then Elena made her way up the steps to the top floor. Elena pulled a 
corner around the banister to see where her friend might be. Then she 
stopped when she heard the soft sound of sobs. Something that Elena 
wasn&#39;t familiar with by experience, but disliked all the same. And she 
knew that to be the sound of Narumi, crying. The tall teen slowly 
tip-toed to the door of Narumi&#39;s door. Then peered through the slight 
gap between the open door and the doorway. Narumi was lying face down on 
her bed, sobbing frantically into her pillow. Her soft black hair was in 
disarray, her glasses were off and Elena knew that she had never seen 
Narumi so sad. What could have caused it? 

The door creaked a bit from Elena&#39;s pressure. Narumi didn&#39;t look up from 
the pillow, but mumbled something into it. &quot;...Go... away, Mom...&quot;

&quot;...Narumi...&quot; Elena spoke softly, opening the door, &quot;...it&#39;s me.&quot;

The shorter woman gasped. The LAST thing she wanted was for Elena to see 
her like this. The girl rose from her tear-stained pillow to reveal the 
tear tracks down her face. She scrambled to compose herself but by then 
it was too late. There was absolutely nothing she could hide from Elena 
(especially not in that state). The cinnamon-skinned beauty was almost 
empathic. She could feel the sadness around her like it was her own. The 
sentiment of which was mirrored in the current expression on Elena&#39;s 
face. When the people around her were unhappy, she was unhappy. The 
Kenyan woman took a seat next to Narumi on the bed and stared at her 
with heart-rending compassion.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Naru-chan?&quot; She asked solemnly, &quot;Why... did you leave me 
behind like that? Did I do something wrong? Did I offend you in some 
way? If I did, then I&#39;m sorry. I promise I won&#39;t do it again.&quot;

It was altruistic comments like those that made this situation so hard 
for Narumi. &quot;...It&#39;s not about you... Elena. You didn&#39;t do anything... 
wrong. It&#39;s me... it&#39;s me... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Elena blinked in confusion. &quot;...What did you do?&quot;

It was not so much what she did, but rather what she felt. Narumi 
snivelled a little and looked downwards. The green-eyed monster was 
making its return as she thought about those guys flirting with Elena. 
&quot;...I just can&#39;t stand seeing people look at you that way! I know it&#39;s 
selfish, but I can&#39;t help it...&quot;

The confusion in Elena&#39;s face could not have been more frank. In her 
ears, it was like Narumi was talking in riddles. But Elena was na&iuml;ve, 
not stupid. Though it was confusing at first, she put real thought into 
what was being said. And evaluated Narumi&#39;s reaction to it all. Her eyes 
soon widened when she realized what was going on here. What Narumi 
&#39;felt&#39;. Suddenly the facts couldn&#39;t have been more clear. Narumi was 
jealous. And she was jealous because... 

Elena&#39;s surprised look became a blank one when she spoke. 
&quot;...Naru-chan... how do you feel about me...?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

The taller of the girls then closed her eyes, with a hint of a smile. 
&quot;Are you going to kiss me?&quot;

Narumi&#39;s confusion was now added with a blush. &quot;...Wha?!&quot;

&quot;Kiss me.&quot; Elena repeated blankly.

At that point; Narumi could not have felt the heat at her cheeks more 
vividly. This was not what she was expecting at all. She expected Elena 
to give her some I-still-like-you-but-I&#39;m-not-into-that-sort-of-thing 
speech. But she got the complete opposite. Narumi was still in the dark 
about all of this; which kept her from reacting quickly enough. Just 
until she noticed Elena frown, saying,

&quot;...How long are you going to keep me waiting...?&quot;

The now shy Narumi could hardly bring herself to reply. The last thing 
she would have thought about happening between them... was this. Was 
this some kind of trick or joke? Elena really wasn&#39;t the type for that. 
This was so hard to explain. But since she couldn&#39;t really think of any 
reason for this action, Narumi nervously went with the flow. She pulled 
herself over her bed and slowly inched towards the waiting Elena; her 
soft lips pursed. Narumi and Elena were face-to-face. So close that 
Elena could feel Narumi&#39;s warm breath against her lips. She was so 
utterly anxious. But Narumi slowly closed those wet eyes of hers and 
leaned in just a little further. Which had the dramatic effect of 
pressing their lips together. It was a sweet kiss; lacking stylish 
finesse and possessed of innocent clumsiness. But neither girl could 
have felt more warm or secure than they presently did. Elena was the one 
to pull away first. And those light auburn lips curled into a smile. 
While Narumi opened her eyes and blinked. Her first kiss. And it was 
with the one girl she wanted all her kisses to be with. Both of the 
girls blushed but Narumi was the one who felt the most awkward about the 
whole thing, pressing her palms into her lap and looking downwards at 
them.

&quot;...L-Like... that?&quot; She timidly asked. 

Elena pressed her hand into Narumi&#39;s. &quot;...I wish you would have told 
me.&quot;

&quot;...I wanted to,&quot; Narumi replied, &quot;I really did. But... it&#39;s hard. I 
thought that if I told you about it... you&#39;d end up hating me.&quot;

The taller girl tilted her head to the side. &quot;Do you hate me?&quot;

&quot;...Of course not,&quot; Narumi&#39;s said seriously, &quot;...Isn&#39;t that obvious? Why 
would you even ask me something like that....?&quot;

No direct reply was given in that instant. Elena just smiled and wrapped 
her arms around the shorter, flushed Narumi. The Japanese teen blinked 
as Elena huddled around her like that in an embrace. She was still 
confused. But that confusion, and all her other worries, became nothing 
more than distant memories when Elena spoke again, uttering, 

&quot;Because I like you too, Naru-chan. I like you a lot.&quot;
