<pre>{What a perfect day.}

The gifted martial artist known as Sakura Kasugano sighed gently as 
she absently played with food. Things weren&#146;t exactly at her best for 
her right now. Sakura woke up so late in the morning, that she had to 
skip breakfast to get to her school, Tamagawa Minami, on time. 

Needless to say, Sakura was still late. 

Her English teacher wasn&#146;t too pleased that Sakura arrived late 
*again* (third time in a week) and was punished with a trademark 
reprimand of highly academic Tokyo schools. Cleaning the hallways.  
And if that wasn&#146;t bad enough, an irritating hunger had settled into 
her stomach. Doing all that window washing and floor moping was 
difficult work, and that work felt even harder to do without a good 
breakfast. 

Sakura just made the best of it and continued to ignore her hunger as 
she proceeded to deal with her other lessons. Then, when it reached 
that ever so appreciated lunch hour, Sakura realized that she wasn&#146;t 
hunger. 

What twisted irony.

But Sakura did have good reason to be so thrown. Karin Kanzuki could 
do that to you. Even as Sakura sat quietly at her table, poking at her 
lunch dejectedly, thoughts of the young blonde fighter invaded what 
little peace she managed to claim. 

{...Great.} Sakura thought. {This is the last thing I need right now. 
To be thinking about her. That&#146;s what made me late in the first 
place.} 

It had been a good few months since Karin&#146;s arrival at Tamagawa 
Minami, and she had already amassed an unrivalled popularity there. 
Especially with the male students. No real surprise there, not really. 
But that wasn&#146;t what was bothering the Kasugano girl.

There was a lot more to it than that. 

They were still rivals, at any length; in fact Karin challenged Sakura 
on a regular basis up until the past few weeks. But things were 
changing on Sakura&#146;s part. There was...an attraction. It wasn&#146;t 
anything blunt, it was subtle, but it was there. 

And Sakura was having a hard time avoiding it. {She is really cute. 
Even though her laugh is like, super-sonic, I do like her...}

Just as Sakura started to think about her, the beautiful Karin Kanzuki 
stepped into the cafeteria through the double doors on the other side 
of the room. And Sakura was possessed by a deep sense of captivation. 

Though they were so minute, Sakura was not oblivious to those tiny 
little things that made Karin look so appealing. The young girl&#146;s eyes 
started from below, adoring sleek, graceful and voluptuous legs. This 
led Sakura&#146;s eyes to a slim, perfectly shaped waist, hovering below an 
unhindered upper body, the apex of which, the Kanzuki girl&#146;s faultless 
chest. 

Sakura&#146;s gaze rose up to Karin&#146;s angel-like face, bejewelled by a 
confident smile and encircled by healthy, bouncing tresses of blonde 
hair. But the most alluring element of Karin&#146;s beauty was her eyes. 
Those twin gems of auburn crystal fire, shining and radiating the 
fighter&#146;s passion that existed within her soul. 

Karin smiled generously as her friends all joked about the things that 
were just waiting to be done over the weekend. Being a Friday, it was 
common to hear this kind of talk. But Sakura really couldn&#146;t think 
much about it. These new thoughts about Karin were really Sakura&#146;s key 
issue. 

The young fighter had come to realize that she was more than *just* 
attracted to Karin, there was something more there that she couldn&#146;t 
place her finger on. Up until now. 

But Sakura was not ready to...admit that yet.

Karin and the girls around her took a seat over at the other side of 
the cafeteria after getting some lunch, and Sakura did her best not to 
stare at the blonde from the corner of her eyes. 

&#147;Hey, Sakura? How come you were late this morning?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes jerked wide as a voice called on her from behind. But 
she relaxed when she saw who was talking to her. 

&#147;Hiya, Kei.&#148; Sakura said quietly. &#147;I didn&#146;t notice you there.&#148;

Kei sat down and dug into her lunch. &#147;Yeah I bet. So why were you late 
this morning? I was waiting at the usual place but you never showed 
up, so...&#148;

Sakura tried to get away from thoughts of Karin. &#147;Sorry, Kei. I lost 
track of time this morning. I even forgot to have breakfast.&#148;

&#147;You forgot to eat?&#148; Kei asked amused. &#147;Hmph! Will wonders never 
cease? Well...to tell you the truth, I thought you were out fighting 
again. You&#146;ve been kinda pre-occupied lately.&#148;

That had Sakura worried. Was her crush on Karin making her act 
differently? &#147;I have? I&#146;m sorry, Kei.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s fine, Sakura.&#148; Kei said. &#147;But that street fighting stuff isn&#146;t 
good for you, honestly.&#148;

Sakura continued to play vaguely with her food as she spoke back. &#147;Oh 
you wouldn&#146;t say that if you were me. But whatever. One of these days 
I should to you to see a real-&#147;

Sakura was cut off by another voice. A slightly lighter one. &#147;Sakura, 
Kei, can I speak with you?&#148;

A blush crossed Sakura&#146;s cheeks from hearing that voice. 

Karin.

Sakura nervously shuffled around avoiding her rival&#146;s eyes, focussing 
more on the backdrop behind her. &#147;Uh...sure, what about?&#148; 

Kei also turned around. &#147;Yeah, we have some time, Kanzuki.&#148;

The youngest daughter of the Kanzuki family smiled brightly, 
brandishing two small sheets of card, decorated elegantly with lined 
cherry flower prints. 

&#147;I am having a party this Saturday, I was wondering if you two would 
come along?&#148; Karin asked. 

Sakura&#146;s eyes narrowed out, despite her curiosity. &#147;Us? But why would 
you want-&#147;

Again, Sakura&#146;s words were sharply cut off by the keen skill of Kei&#146;s 
hand wrapping around her mouth. &#147;Oh, Kanzuki, we&#146;d love to go! You&#146;ve 
got directions on the invites, right?&#148;

Karin nodded, her French-styled locks of hair bounding while doing so. 
&#147;That&#146;s correct. I look forward to seeing you there.&#148;

The sparkler bit brown eyes of Karin glinted a little as she looked 
towards Sakura, with a small smile to accompany this. Sakura caught 
this out and her own eyes went wide with confusion. But before either 
could say anything Karin quickly handed the invitations to Kei, and 
went over to other tables to present more invites. 

Sakura just let herself fall quiet, while Kei piped up. &#147;Gee, Sakura. 
I used to think that Kanzuki girl was a stuck up rich kid, but she&#146;s 
actually kinda nice. She&#146;s rich isn&#146;t she? Oh, I bet there&#146;ll be a ton 
of guys there!&#148;

&#147;Yeah...yeah I guess so.&#148; Sakura managed to mumble. 

This was so weird. Karin had been acting...nicely to Sakura these past 
few days. Were things changing between them? 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   

&#147;Yo, Hinata? Have you been listening to me?&#148;

Shaking her head quickly, Hinata Wakaba snapped back from her thought 
given reverie. She and Sakura were sitting together on a small park 
bench that was only a short distance from Taiyo High School. The two 
martial arts schoolgirls had planned to see each other more, they 
hadn&#146;t gotten together much ever since that dreadful business with 
Justice High. 

Even though Hinata regretted that she and Sakura hadn&#146;t seen much of 
each other, she could understand why. They both had a lot of things to 
deal with. And Finals were an issue. That would change everything. 

Nevertheless, Sakura and Hinata had made specific plans, cleared each 
other&#146;s calendars and set aside this day to catch-up and have fun, 
just like the old days. 

Too bad Hinata couldn&#146;t focus well. &#147;Sorry, Sakura. I was thinking 
about stuff.&#148;

Sakura leaned back on the bench. &#147;You don&#146;t sound too cheery. What&#146;s 
up?&#148;

Though she had been thinking about it a lot, her dilemma wasn&#146;t doing 
any better. &#147;I dunno. I guess I...I&#146;m just missing Kyosuke a little.&#148;

That name brought back memories for Hinata. She could never forget the 
effort she, Batsu and Kyosuke had made against Justice and Hyo. Quite 
clearly she could recall Hyo&#146;s nightmarish power, and the trouble that 
it took to take him down. Shortly after his death, Kyosuke just 
disappeared. Nobody had any idea where he was or how long he would be, 
all Hinata knew was that she missed him dearly. 

Hinata chuckled nostalgically. &#147;You know, I always used to tease him 
about how quiet he was, and the way he was always doing things on his 
own. I always asked him what he was thinking, whenever he stared out 
of a window or something. Kyosuke either blanked me or told me not to 
worry about it. It kinda annoyed me...but now I&#146;d do anything for him 
to just tell me to mind my own business.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s been a while since you last saw him, hasn&#146;t it?&#148; Sakura asked. 

Hinata nodded slowly. &#147;Yeah.&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes narrowed. Since when has Hinata been this pensive? 
Unless... &#147;Hinata...are you...?&#148;

&#147;Heck no!&#148; Hinata blushed and looked away. &#147;I mean...I don&#146;t think 
so...&#148;

&#147;He&#146;ll come back.&#148; Sakura said. &#147;It must have been a big shock. To 
lose his brother like that. I think Kyosuke just needs time to get 
back on his feet.&#148;

&#147;I guess so. So what about you?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

Hinata smiled a little. &#147;You&#146;re acting all supportive and wise. It&#146;s 
not like you.&#148;

Even though it was a joke, Sakura didn&#146;t take it like that. &#147;So I&#146;m 
not supportive, huh?&#148;

&#147;Come on, Sakura you know I didn&#146;t mean it like that.&#148;

The Kasugano woman breathed out a little. &#147;I know, I know. Sorry, I&#146;m 
wound up too tight. I&#146;ve kinda been...lost these past few days.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148; Hinata question, adjusting her bow a little. &#147;Guy problems?&#148;

Sakura drifted as Karin came to mind again. &#147;Not...exactly.&#148;

&#147;Well then, what is it? Schoolwork, your little brother?&#148;

Sakura tried her hardest to get this out. &#147;Hinata...I think...I think 
I&#146;m falling in love.&#148;

Hinata&#146;s eyes shot open, staring hard at her friend. &#147;Really? Are you 
sure?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Well who is he?&#148; Hinata had to admit, she was very curious. &#147;Does he 
go to Tamagawa Minami with you?&#148;

&#147;Yeah...but...&#148;

Regardless of Sakura&#146;s nervousness, Hinata drilled on. &#147;Well what&#146;s 
his name? Come on, spill!&#148;

&#147;...Karin.&#148;

Hinata thought about that. &#147;Karin? That&#146;s a weird name for a guy to 
have. Sounds more like a gir-&#147;

Hinata stopped herself when the obvious came to mind. Sakura just 
looked away, unable to say anything. Even though Hinata was her good 
friend, Sakura dreaded telling her about these newfound feelings that 
she had for Karin. 

Hinata was stunned. &#147;Sakura...? You&#146;re in love with another girl, 
aren&#146;t you?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s head lulled into a droop. &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148; Hinata asked, her smile returning to her. &#147;You&#146;re in love! 
That&#146;s a good thing.&#148;

Sakura&#146;s marble eyes looked up. &#147;You mean...you&#146;re not freaked?&#148;

&#147;Of course not!&#148; Hinata just waved off Sakura&#146;s misgivings and pulled 
the young fighter into a loving hug. No matter what happened to either 
of them, it would never get in the way of their friendship.

&#147;You&#146;re my friend Sakura, nothing is ever going to change that.&#148;

Sakura relaxed in Hinata&#146;s embrace. &#147;Thank you, Hinata. You don&#146;t know 
how much this means to me.&#148;

Slowly, Hinata pulled back and tugged a loose strand of hair behind 
her ear. &#147;So, how does this &#145;Karin&#146; feel about you?&#148;

Sakura beamed a sad smile. That told Hinata everything. &#147;I&#146;m not 
hopefully, if that&#146;s what you mean.&#148; Sakura began. &#147;She transferred to 
Tamagawa Minami about four months ago. She said she was a street 
fighter, I took her on, and I kicked her butt.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s...good...&#148;

Sakura ignored the sarcasm. &#147;Ever since then, she&#146;s been challenging 
me to battles after school and stuff. But just these past two weeks, 
she&#146;s been acting differently around me.&#148;

&#147;Like how?&#148;

&#147;Smiling at me, sitting next to me in class, greeting me in the halls. 
I mean she even invited me to a party she&#146;s having tomorrow. Kei was 
going crazy about it, but I don&#146;t even know if I wanna go.&#148;

&#147;Because she&#146;ll be there.&#148; Hinata enquired.

&#147;Yep.&#148; Sakura confirmed that. &#147;I can&#146;t explain it Hinata, she&#146;s so 
pompous and vain but...I still like her.&#148;

Hinata heaved a sigh. &#147;You sure are dense, Sakura. If you like her 
then just tell her so. Or maybe flirt with her or something. Put on 
some of that &#145;Sakura charm&#146; we all know and love.&#148; 

Sakura just rolled her eyes. &#147;Yeah right. And just when will she be 
alone for me to hit with her? Karin always has, like a bajillion guys 
swarming over her.&#148;  

&#147;Oh...she&#146;s pretty popular then, huh?&#148;

&#147;You got it.&#148; Sakura leaned forward again. &#147;She&#146;s gorgeous, she&#146;s rich 
and she&#146;s good at school. What chance have I got?&#148;

Hinata scowled at all this defeatist talk. 

&#147;Stop acting so sorry for yourself. You know, I never really had you 
pegged as a coward, Sakura.&#148;

That was a shock. &#147;What?&#148;

&#147;You heard me.&#148; Hinata quipped bluntly. &#147;I dunno who you are, but the 
Sakura I know wouldn&#146;t sulk around, she&#146;d go for it. I mean, you have 
so many good things going for you. Anyone would be nuts not to fall 
for you, Sakura.&#148;

&#147;...Hinata...&#148;

Hinata continued on. &#147;Look, I&#146;m no expert on these things, heck, I&#146;m 
probably the last girl you should be talking to about it. But if you 
avoid these feelings you have for her, it&#146;ll hurt that much more. Even 
if she doesn&#39;t feel the same way, just tell her how you feel. 

That way you can at least put it behind you and move on. Then I&#39;ll get 
the old Sakura back.&#148;

A happy smile replaced Sakura&#146;s sad one. That was Hinata&#146;s greatest 
power. You could never be in an unhappy mood around her. 

&#147;You know...you&#146;re a really good friend, miss Wakaba.&#148;

Smiling a bit, Hinata stood, stretching her arms from being grounded 
for so long. &#147;Hey, that&#146;s what I&#146;m here for. Well, I&#146;m starved. You 
wanna grab a bite to eat?&#148;

Sakura thought about that indecisively. &#147;...Well...&#148;

&#147;Come on, I&#146;m buying!&#148; Hinata winked at her friend.

That was enough to sway Sakura. &#147;You betcha. Thanks, Hinata. For 
everything.&#148;  

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Karin chanced a gaze at the massive grandfather clock just adjacent 
from her. It was Saturday, around 8.35, and a few guests hadn&#146;t 
arrived just yet. Though from the activities going on in the backdrop 
of her mansion, you wouldn&#146;t have been able to see whether or not 
everyone was here. 

Karin had really gone to some effort for this thing. Her parents had 
gone out on business, and wouldn&#146;t be back until Monday. Obviously 
this was the perfect time to hold a party. Hopefully though, Ishikawa 
wouldn&#146;t blow this for her by spilling the beans to her parents when 
they got back. But whatever the situation, people were having lots of 
fun, dancing and chatting about everything, and nobody had the 
slightest intention of leaving yet. 

One of Karin&#146;s friends had to hazard a look at the young fighter. And 
the way she kept alternating glances between the door and the clock. 

&#147;Yo, Karin.&#148; She said loudly, trying to speak over the music in the 
background. &#147;What&#146;s up with you? Who are you waiting for?&#148;

Karin looked away, with a still look in her eyes. &#147;...No one.&#148;

A brief ring sounded around the house. Karin&#146;s head jerked over to 
stare at the front door of the hallway. She briskly dashed to the door 
as casually as possible, greeting the two people she saw as she opened 
it.

A nervous Sakura and an ecstatic Kei. &#147;Hey, guys...welcome to my 
party.&#148;

Kei&#146;s eyes shone with delight as she peered inside. &#147;Wow, Kanzuki! 
This party is pretty cool!&#148;

&#147;Yes well.&#148; Karin tried her hardest not to let pride get to her. &#147;It 
wasn&#146;t all my doing. I had a lot of help with certain things...&#148;

While Kei and Karin got to their politely impersonal talking, Sakura 
took a gamble and observed Karin Kanzuki from the corner of her eyes. 
She was wearing a very unique Chinese-style dress, evenly cut at the 
thigh downwards. Her was loose, falling freely around her shoulders, 
unlike the 1880&#146;s French-like hairstyle that Karin had become 
accustomed to. Sakura had to admit, Karin did look really beautiful. 
Which made Sakura reflect on herself. She had made no special effort 
for this thing, just her normal clothes. Which was kind of awkward 
from taking a look at Karin. 

Karin looked over to Sakura, whom was uncharacteristically quiet. &#147;I&#146;m 
glad you could come.&#148;

Sakura felt herself melt with that hypnotic look that Karin&#146;s crystal 
brown eyes were beaming at her. &#147;Uh...yeah...um, thanks.&#148;

Before she said or did anything stupid, Sakura quickly walked inside 
and strolled into a densely crowded room to get away from this at the 
moment. Karin looked over at Kei as if to question Sakura&#146;s reasoning 
for this, but the young girl just shrugged and greeted some of her 
other friends. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

{Whew...that&#146;s a little better.}

A breath of fresh air wisped softly into Sakura as she stepped out 
into the large gardens of the Kanzuki family estate. Most parts of 
Karin&#146;s house were open to guests accept for a few rooms, and this 
large garden was no exception. 

Sakura just needed some space. She loved parties just as much as the 
next gal. But within that place was Karin and Sakura was tired of 
bouncing from room to room to avoid her. It was also nice to get a 
little unsullied air from the outside. Even though the whole reason 
she came here was to tell Karin how she felt, the brunette was having 
a hard enough time getting herself to look Karin in the eye. 

{Was Hinata right?} Sakura thought. {Have I changed? I mean when did I 
become such a chicken...? Is it because I-}

Sakura&#146;s thoughts were interrupted as someone stepped across to her. 
&#147;Sakura? What are you doing out here?&#148;

&#147;Gah!&#148; After all that time avoiding her, Karin had her cornered. 
Whichever kind of luck was responsible for this, Sakura sure wasn&#146;t 
thankful for it. 

At that point, Sakura was leaning on a large stone statue just across 
from the door back into the mansion. She tried in vain not to act too 
awkwardly around her. &#147;...Hey...&#148;

Karin tugged a strand of her hair back. &#147;Why are you out here? Aren&#146;t 
you enjoying the party?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s nice.&#148; That was fairly unconvincing. &#147;I just needed a little 
space, is all.&#148;

&#147;I see.&#148; Karin stepped a little closer to Sakura. &#147;I am a little 
surprised that you came.&#148;

That had Sakura genuinely curious. &#147;How&#146;s that?&#148;

&#147;Well...you and I aren&#146;t exactly friends, are we?&#148; 

&#147;So then why did you invite me here?&#148;

A silence fell. Neither of them, least of all Karin, was prepared to 
say anything. But a willingness to get out of a now uncomfortable 
stillness took her over. &#147;...Are you tired?&#148;

For now, Sakura ignored Karin&#146;s evasion of the question, and focused 
on the current query. &#147;Not really. What makes you say that?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve been a bit...under-spirited. It isn&#146;t really what I&#146;ve come to 
expect from you, Sakura.&#148;    

Sakura never really looked at it like that. &#147;I guess I could use more 
sleep. I&#146;m always training these days. And I never get any peace and 
quiet at home, my little brother&#146;s always causing trouble.&#148;

&#147;Would you rather be fighting?&#148;

&#147;Instead of at a party?&#148; Sakura asked. &#147;Yeah, maybe just a little. 
There&#146;s something about street fighting that just sets me off.&#148;

Karin smiled gently. It had been only a few months after her defeat at 
the hands of Sakura but the day remained fresh in her mind. One thing 
that Karin knew was that their desires and expectations from fighting 
was very different.  

&#147;That&#146;s why you fight, isn&#146;t it?&#148; Karin said. &#147;For the thrill?&#148;

Sakura nodded sweetly. &#147;Yep. Fighting an equal or a superior is real 
fun for me. What about you?&#148;

Karin didn&#146;t need to think about that. &#147;I do love fighting, almost as 
if it were a part of me. But I fight for perfection. That is the 
ambition of my family. Perfection.&#148;

For once, Sakura forgot about her situation with this girl and just 
spoke. &#147;Y&#146;know, nobody&#146;s ever really perfect. I love street fighting 
and I know I&#146;m pretty tough, but I still have a long way to go. Just 
like Ryu.&#148;

Karin was inquisitive about that gleam in Sakura&#146;s eyes when she spoke 
of that name. 

Ryu. 

Although she learned from her associations with Ken Masters that her 
practiced the same fighting style as Sakura and Ken himself, there was 
very little she actually knew about him. But what she did know was 
that he was a very skilled fighter. Taking down Sagat, the &#145;God of 
Muey Thai&#146; was proof of that.

Though Karin was more curious of Sakura&#146;s knowledge of him. &#147;Ryu?&#148;

&#147;Yep.&#148; Sakura gave off a distant aura as she recalled the man known as 
Ryu. &#147;He really inspires me. He&#146;s so strong, so powerful. But he still 
fights on. To better himself, discover himself and to discover why he 
fights. And what it means to fight.&#148;

Karin studied Sakura closely. &#147;You...really like this Ryu person, 
don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;Sure I do.&#148; Sakura uttered. &#147;I wouldn&#146;t have gotten very far in 
martial arts if it weren&#146;t for him. Ryu is my muse. But also my rival. 
One day I wanna become better than him, and show him everything I&#146;ve 
learned.&#148;

&#147;You know...&#148; Karin began. &#147;I have someone who inspires me in that 
same way.&#148;

&#147;Who is that?&#148;

Karin became silent again. Sakura got the feeling that she stepped on 
something personal. Rather than dwell on it, Sakura ambled the 
conversation elsewhere. 

&#147;Hey, it&#146;s okay. You don&#146;t have to tell me anything.&#148; Sakura assured 
this with a small smile. Karin realized that Sakura didn&#146;t understand 
her meaning. 

&#147;You&#146;ve...improved since our last battle, haven&#146;t you?&#148; Karin asked. 

Sakura nodded. &#147;Uh huh. I like said, I train a lot these days. That&#146;s 
just the way I am. I&#146;m sure that you&#146;ve polished up some of the hand 
strikes of yours, right?&#148;

Karin grinned, waving her hand provocatively in the air. &#147;That&#146;s 
right. You know I&#146;m always ready to do it again.&#148;

&#147;Sure!&#148; Sakura said brightly. &#147;If you wanna...&#148;

Sakura then stopped as she looked at Karin. Her palms were flattened 
out evenly, her body was moving in a slow, rhythmic stance. And there 
again was the fighter&#146;s gleam in her eyes. Even wearing something as 
petite as that evening dress, Karin&#146;s intent was just a threatening. 

With a bright blush, Sakura tried to ignore the silky thigh that was 
peering out from Karin&#146;s dress. &#147;Karin...&#148;

The Kanzuki girl smiled. &#147;Why not? I&#146;m ready for you. You have 
improved; I have improved, lets see how much by. Don&#146;t tell that you 
are not the least bit curious...?&#148;

Sakura really couldn&#146;t deny Karin anything even if she wanted to. And 
it was true; she was interested about how far Karin had come since 
their last battle. With a feverish grin, Sakura pushed herself from 
the statue she was leaning on, and adopted one of her trademark 
fighting stances. &#147;Why not? Let&#146;s do it...&#148;      

Sakura locked in on Karin. There was a playfully smile on her lips. 
Something was different about this. But Sakura really couldn&#146;t place 
it, and at the moment, she wasn&#146;t really bothered that she couldn&#146;t. 

Karin slowly inched over to Sakura, one step at a time, always 
maintaining her near flawless form. Then with a hard yell, Karin 
charged at her rival, pushing her palm forward in clean strikes. 
Sakura deftly guarded against the vacuum-like thrusts of Karin&#146;s Guren 
Ken, raising her elbows to defend against them. Karin wasted no time, 
and swiftly lifted her leg into the air to strike at Sakura from the 
side.

Once more, Sakura saw that playful smile on Karin, and her eyes when 
wide with surprise as Karin&#146;s nimble and enthralling leg kicked at her 
left shoulder. A small yelp was released, but Sakura did not stumble. 
Another one of Karin&#146;s trademark Guren Ken palm thrusts came in her 
direction, and the self-learned fighter swung to one side, Karin&#146;s 
air-breaking palm sliced along the fabric of her skirt. Sakura held 
firm, and lowered to the ground, sweeping her left leg under Karin&#146;s 
feet. 

Karin gasped from shock, tumbling over Sakura&#146;s extended leg and 
landing crudely on the cold wet grass. Before she lost any more 
ground, Karin curled her arms backward and pushed upwards, just as 
Sakura&#146;s fist came in her direction. The punch pounded the ground and 
only the ground, as Karin backward rolled away from Sakura. 

Using her newly refined artistic skill, Karin rolled back into a 
crouching position, watching Sakura eagerly. It was obvious that Karin 
was enjoying this; she didn&#146;t even care that grass smudges had stained 
her yellow evening dress. 

Sakura ran forwards towards Karin, building up speed, then hopped into 
the air, her school skirt whipping up in the breeze. She branched out 
her leg, aiming her sharply timed flying kick at her adversary. Karin 
sidestepped out of the way, narrowly avoiding the strike. Sakura&#146;s 
eyes went wide as her heel collided with the ground, trying clumsily 
to slow down the friction of the slide. 

With a bit of effort, Sakura managed to stop skidding. {Geez...} 
Sakura thought. {Why can&#146;t I concentrate?}

Soon, Sakura&#146;s ears were filled with Karin&#146;s trademark laughter. &#147;Oh, 
ho, ho, ho, ho! Not exactly what you were expecting, Kasugano?&#148;

Sakura took on another fighting stance, her headband flocking in the 
cool wind that was picking up. &#147;Oh, we just got started.&#148;

Karin came at Sakura again, moving quickly but in an even pace. Sakura 
tried hard to instil some order into her game, but something was 
throwing her out of whack. As she got in front of Sakura, Karin let 
loose with a vicious chain of palm strikes and punches, so quick that 
they were hard to detect. Sakura held off the blows by protecting 
herself with an awkwardly timed double arm guard. It was a sloppy 
move. 

Karin drew back her palm evenly, and thrust it hard into Sakura&#146;s 
stomach, knocking a whip of air from the schoolgirl prodigy. Sakura 
gasped, but Karin gave no quarter, grabbing her right arm. Just for 
measure, Karin leaned towards a breathless Sakura, whispering into her 
ear. 

&#147;You know...&#148; Karin&#146;s voice was strangely seductive. &#147;If you don&#146;t 
fight me seriously, you&#146;ll lose, Sakura...&#148;

That caught the girl&#146;s attention, but Karin left her no time to think 
about it. With another yell of intent, Karin span Sakura&#146;s arm in a 
circular motion, pulling Sakura off her feet and spinning her over, 
smashing the young girl into the cold grass once more. 

Karin smiled at her fallen challenger, placing her hands on her hips 
and wiggling her thighs a little. &#147;Is this the limit of my ultimate 
rival?&#148; 

Groaning a little, Sakura rose up, putting the blades of grass from 
her skirt and uniform. {Why...can&#146;t I focus? Is it because it&#146;s Karin 
I&#146;m fighting?}

Once more, Karin wasted no time by idling, and rushed towards Sakura 
with her palms at the ready. Realizing that she had to do something 
before Karin started wearing her down; Sakura turned shoulders to the 
side and cupped her hands at her waist, gathering energy between her 
palms. When the power growing was strong enough to form an attack, 
Sakura brought her arms forward to an advancing Karin, firing the 
legendary wave of burning hot spirit energy.

&#147;Hadouken!&#148;

Karin urgently rolled to her left to avoid the powerful wave of 
compressed energy, and tumbled across the grass. Sakura leapt into the 
air, clear above the ground, and descended on Karin. The wealthy girl 
smiled as Sakura plummeted downwards.

{That&#146;s the Sakura I know.}

Without wasting more time, Karin rolled across the ground again, as 
Sakura&#146;s fist and knee collided with the ground. Karin quickly got 
back onto her feet, and looked over to the small ditch that Sakura&#146;s 
drop had made. Sakura wasn&#146;t there. 

Karin&#146;s crystal brown eyes took a look around, but no sign of her. 
Until...

&#147;Shou&#146;ou Ken!&#148;

A hard gasp of shock emanated from Karin as Sakura&#146;s fist rammed into 
a sequence of multiple blows, causing more damage as she ran. Before 
she knew it, Karin was rising with Sakura&#146;s last uppercut to finish 
the chain, delivering a fierce blow to the jaw. 

Karin was tossed across the air and into the grass, and Sakura landed 
gracefully with her outspread fist retracting in her descent. After 
catching her breath, Sakura looked over at Karin, who was lying limply 
on the ground.    

&#147;Karin!&#148; 

Sakura quickly ran over to the downed fighter, kneeling over her and 
quickly inspected her. &#147;Karin? Are you okay?&#148;

The blonde&#146;s eyes fluttered open, with a weak smile. &#147;I...knew you 
could do it...&#148;

That made her happy. To know that Karin was without harm. There was 
something more between that though. Karin&#146;s eyes looked up playfully 
into Sakura&#146;s expressively nervous ones, causing a throbbing sensation 
to build with Sakura like never before. Even though she had distracted 
herself from it during the fight, Karin&#146;s beauty shone through 
stronger than it ever had. With her now loose hair splayed out across 
the ground, chest heaving, and eyes shining. Karin had that amazing 
look of a deity.   

Sakura&#146;s cheeks went red as she fumbled to speak. &#147;I...um...&#148;

&#147;Am I making you uncomfortable?&#148; Though she sounded innocent, the 
smile on Karin&#146;s face was far from it. 

&#147;No...I just...&#148;

One of Karin&#146;s slender hands was placed gently onto Sakura&#146;s soft 
cheek. &#147;Do you know...that you are very beautiful, Sakura?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s blush deepened. &#147;...Karin...&#148;

&#147;Sakura...&#148; Karin began. &#147;Do you remember that I told you I had 
someone who really inspires me?&#148;

The young woman nodded, not willing to break the connection between 
Karin&#146;s flesh and her own. 

&#147;Do you know who that was?&#148;

Sakura just shook her head. 

For this, Karin smiled brightly, stroking Sakura&#146;s gently rose-tinted 
cheek. &#147;It was you.&#148;

Just on impulse, Sakura wished to say something to that, but the words 
could not be released. Karin&#146;s head tilted upwards and her soft set of 
lips connected with Sakura&#146;s. The shorthaired girl froze in shock, 
completely taken off guard by Karin&#146;s affection. 

But there was no fighting it.

Instead of questioning Karin for this, Sakura returned the kiss, 
nestling closely against the object of her desire.   

Karin was hers.
