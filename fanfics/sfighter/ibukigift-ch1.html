<h1>Ibuki's Gift (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sfighter/index.html">Street Fighter</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ravenest.html">Ravenest</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ibuki suddenly woke up, sweaty and panting for the third time this 
week. &quot;Sakura&#133;&quot; She whispered. The ninja knew that it was Sakura&#146;s 
birthday in only a couple of days and Ibuki hadn&#146;t had time to look 
for something to buy her. Every night since she found out Ibuki had 
dreamt of her and Sakura being together. Holding hands&#133; and kissing... 
and then&#133; 

As she thought about it she became more and more excited. Soon she 
slid her hand down to her panties and began stroking them. With as 
soft moan she turned to the side and pressed harder. But suddenly the 
picture of Ryu dove into her mind. 

&quot;Damn it Ibuki! Baka, baka, baka! You can&#146;t have her; she would never&#133; 
NEVER&#133; but&#133; still&#133;&quot; The ninja sighed as she stood up and grabbed some 
clothes. The sun from an incredibly big window lighted up her room, it 
worked as a sort of alarm-clock, since Ibuki found it very hard 
sleeping during the day time, and night time for that matter. And 
having the sun bursting into her room also made her a bit less sleepy. 
She quickly slid into her suit and grabbed her school-outfit. 

&quot;Hello! She is in LOVE with that Ryu character, she is so stuck with 
him she&#133; and&#133;&quot; Ibuki growled as she put the dress in a pouch under the 
ninja suit. Eiji Kisagari, Ibuki&#146;s present teacher in the Ninjitsu 
style, came into her room and asked if there was a problem. 

&quot;NO! Of course not I just, just&#133;&quot; 

&quot;What is wrong with me anyway? She is a girl&#133; and I am&#133; and yet I want 
her so bad I can TASTE it!&quot; The younger ninja thought looking not too 
happy. 

&quot;Ibuki, if you have a problem you should tell me. It won&#146;t do you any 
good having it nagging you in the neck. You must be concentrated and 
focused&#133;&quot; 

&quot;&#133; or else I will be unable to make progress blah, blah, blah!&quot; Ibuki 
made a talkie motion with her left hand. She couldn&#146;t talk to him 
about it, he wouldn&#146;t understand. 

&quot;Well, if there IS a problem then&#133; Maybe you could talk to Mai, she 
has come back from her journey and I think you should pay her a 
visit.&quot; Eiji said with a soft voice. 

&quot;But I don&#146;t have a p&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I think you should anyway! Now, now, off you go little girl.&quot; Eiji 
grabbed her shoulders and made sure she was on her way towards Mai&#146;s 
training grounds. Unwillingly Ibuki continued in that direction&#133; 

Mai&#146;s training grounds was located not far from Ibuki&#146;s home. It was a 
large open space surrounded by walls built in a typical Chinese style. 
As Ibuki entered she could see several other students practicing, 
mostly girls. This made Ibuki feel uneasy and as she looked at a 
couple sparing with each other, training throws, she had to stop to 
take a peek. 

&quot;Such close contact with another&#133; impossible!&quot; Ibuki gasped as one of 
the girls threw the other with a leg-hook and landed on top. 

&quot;Hey Ibuki!&quot; The girl on top said, Ibuki suddenly recognized her as 
Yuri, but wearing gi. She had been taking care of the training ground 
while Mai was away. 

&quot;Yuri! Eh&#133; is Mai around here somewhere? I am supposed to talk to 
her.&quot; 

&quot;Mai-san? Well I think she&#146;s over there, with that new one, if you 
hurry you might catch them before they go for the buildings.&quot; Yuri 
pointed to a spot behind Ibuki. 

&quot;Arigato, Yuri-chan.&quot; Ibuki turned around and could see two figures 
about a hundred yards from her&#133; 

As Ibuki got closer she could see Mai talking to a girl, also dressed 
in a gi. The ninja lowered her speed as she got closer and shouted 
Mai&#146;s name.Mai turned to Ibuki and looked at her. It had been almost a 
year and she could see that the smaller ninja had grown a bit since. 

As Ibuki looked back the young ninja noticed that Mai hadn&#146;t changed a 
lot since last time, still wearing far too little clothing and&#133; there 
was something, she felt strange as she looked at the kunoichi, almost 
as if&#133; 

&quot;Ibuki-chan!&quot; Mai said and hugged her. Ibuki swallowed hard and felt 
her heart race as their bodies came close. Mai&#146;s skin was hot as 
flames against her and the kunoichi&#146;s smell filled Ibuki&#146;s lunges, 
sweet like a flower it made the ninja dizzy. 

&quot;How have you been?&quot; Mai suddenly grabbed Ibuki by her sides and 
looked lovingly into the ninja&#146;s eyes. She swallowed again and felt 
her heart beating like a bass drum. 

&quot;Makoto, go spar with Yuri and I will show you the rest some other 
time..&quot; 

&quot;Hai Mai-sensei!&quot; The girl, obviously the new one, nodded and was on 
her way. Ibuki was thinking she knew the girl from somewhere, but 
couldn&#146;t place it, she glanced at the girl as she ran away. 

Mai still holding her lifted her eyebrow and nodded as she looked 
back, as if she was about to ask something. 

&quot;F-f-fine, and you&#133; Mai-san?&quot; Ibuki pressed out of her mouth. 

What was wrong? Was she in love with her former sensei? 

&quot;I can&#146;t be, I-I love Sakura.&quot; Ibuki felt very uneasy but her other 
feelings were to strong for her not to react. With a very slow motion 
Ibuki&#146;s hand traveled centimeters from Mai&#146;s side while she babbled 
about something with the King of Fighters tournament, and finally 
Ibuki&#146;s hand reached the back of the red haired kunoichi&#146;s head. 

&quot;M-Mai-san&#133; I&#133; I&#133; huuhhh&#133;&quot; But the smaller ninja couldn&#146;t take the 
tension and pushed Mai away. The kunoichi&#146;s eyes widened as she did 
so, but said nothing. Ibuki bent her legs so that she came low and 
looked into the ground. 

&quot;Glad&#133; glad you&#146;re back sensei.&quot; She said, not sounding very 
convinced. 

&quot;Hey, where&#146;s the happy and challenging ninja I knew. Have you seen 
her? Let&#146;s see&#133; She has long black hair tied into a cute ponytail, a 
green ninja suit and she loves ice-cream.&quot; 

Ibuki couldn&#146;t help but to smile. &quot;Hehehe&#133; stop it. You know I am not 
a kid anymore.&quot; Ibuki said finally looking up at the kunoichi. 
However, Mai noticed a well-hidden sad look behind the ninja&#146;s eyes. 

&quot;What&#146;s the matter Ibuki, you don&#146;t look to well. Hey, don&#146;t tell me&#133; 
umm&#133; you have finally been beaten by Dan!&quot; 

&quot;WHAT? DAN? Are you kidding me? I could beat him up while changing my 
undies! I am not a kid anymore.&quot; 

&quot;Well aren&#146;t you&#133;?&quot; Mai said. 

&quot;What&#133; you&#133; you think so?&quot; 

&quot;Well, No, of course not. I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Mai looked at the smaller ninja 
and again noticed a somewhat sad and even worried expression. 

&quot;Is it something with your training. Eiji is taking well care of you?&quot; 
Mai asked. 

&quot;No. Eiji is nice and training is just fine.&quot; 

Mai was puzzled, what could be the little ninja&#146;s problem? It was 
something for sure, Ibuki had always been the happier of them. Nothing 
with her training&#133; &quot;How&#146;s school then?&quot; 

&quot;I&#133; &#133; &#133; It&#146;s f-fine.&quot; Ibuki looked the other away. 

&quot;Well it is a boy then! In your age that must be the problem!&quot; Mai 
said musically, trying to cheer the ninja up. What she didn&#146;t expect 
was that Ibuki suddenly started to cry. 

&quot;Noooo&#133; it is not a BOY&#133; *sob*&#133; *sob*&#133; it is NOT! That isss the 
problem!&quot; Ibuki whispered only moving her lips, while pressing her 
jaws and teeth together as hard as she could. However Mai overheard 
this in somehow. 

&quot;Nani&#133;?&quot; She suddenly realized. 

&quot;It is a girl isn&#146;t it?&quot; Ibuki said nothing, she was just shaking her 
head and holding her hands to her eyes, trying to stop the tears 
flooding. What was Mai to say now, would she hate her for liking girls 
instead of boys? Would she not want her to spar with, and what would 
Eiji say? Ibuki shivered as she heard her former sensei&#146;s voice again. 

&quot;That&#146;s not a problem!&quot; Mai said softly. Ibuki suddenly stopped crying 
for a while. 

&quot;It&#133; it isn&#146;t?&quot; She said with a small voice. 

&quot;Of course not, why would you think that!?&quot; 

&quot;B-but&#133; but&#133;&quot; Ibuki felt as a rock was lifted from her chest. Although 
very insecure and still half-crying she felt a bit better. 

&quot;Now tell me who it is and we might talk about it.&quot; Mai said leading 
the sobbing ninja to a nearby bench. She waved at some nearby 
trainee&#146;s to move further away. 

&quot;S&#133; s&#133; Sakura&#133; f-from my c-class.&quot; Ibuki told Mai everything after a 
while. About Sakura&#146;s birthday, Ibuki&#146;s wet nights and about how she 
felt. 

&quot;Hmm, ah, I know her. She is pretty good I&#146;ve heard. But isn&#146;t she 
chasing that Ryu character.&quot; 

&quot;Y-yes, she is&#133; amazing&#133; and&#133; and&#133; yes she is after Ryu!&quot; Ibuki had 
stopped crying but was looking away. 

&quot;Oh! You poor thing you. I didn&#146;t know.&quot; 

Ibuki said nothing. 

&quot;But hey. I have an idea.&quot; Mai said with an almost singing voice. 

&quot;What&#133;?&quot; Ibuki said sounding a bit depressed. 

&quot;Hey, you must spar with me first or I won&#146;t tell you! If you are good 
I will buy you some ice-cream.&quot; 

&quot;Oishi!&quot; Ibuki cried as she stood up licking her lips. 

*** 

Ibuki turned her hand into a fist and smacked it into the ground as 
she put up the hang-glider. 

&quot;Taste it&#133;&quot; The girl whispered. She put her fingers to her lips, 
stroking them gently, trying to imagine Sakura&#146;s lips against hers, 
but as Sakura&#146;s picture dove into her mind she&#133; tripped. The hang 
glider had gotten hold of the wind already and pulled the young ninja 
with it. 

&quot;Oww&#133; Damn it!&quot; The ninja smacked her cheek as she stood up, lifted 
the glider and put the belt around her waist. She could still feel the 
taste of vanilla ice cream in her mouth but was too bothered to care. 

&quot;Maybe I should forget about the whole thing&#133; oh well, I can at least 
get her a present.&quot; Mai had told Ibuki that she would find Ryu and try 
to get his headband. Ibuki insisted though, she wanted to get it for 
herself. And with any luck Sakura would either forget about her beaten 
idol or at least appreciate what Ibuki had done for her. That would be 
getting the headband of course! The ninja checked so that she got the 
hooks right. And pulling the glider with her hands she jumped&#133; 
  
*** 

Two days later, somewhere in India. 

Ryu was bored. He had been wandering through India for seven weeks now 
and hadn&#146;t been in a fight for as long as he could remember. Sure he 
could train in the mountains here but with no REAL competition around 
he would be bored with it quite soon. With no food he went into town 
buy some. 

He found a little market place but didn&#146;t have time put his sack down 
before he noticed a hook with a string on it catching a sign beside 
him. He was then attacked from behind and turned to block three-side 
thrust kick&#146;s coming in blindingly fast. Ibuki had after two day&#146;s 
intense searching found Ryu and decided that an attack from behind, 
although cheap, was necessary for her to make if she&#146;d have a chance 
at winning. 

Disappointed in her missing from such a clear view the ninja quickly 
jumped back and took her stance. 

&quot;What are you doing kid?&quot; The surprised Ryu asked. 

&quot;I am challenging you! Now fight me or I will have to beat you where 
you stand, either way I will win!&quot; Ibuki said trying to sound as 
serious and confident as she could. She didn&#146;t have time to negotiate, 
Sakura&#146;s birthday was tomorrow. 

&quot;Impossible, I don&#146;t fight underage girls!&quot; Ryu even though he felt 
the urge to fight burning inside him. 

&quot;I am NO GIRL! I am a WOMAN! Now what are you waiting for! Ikuzo!&quot; 
Ibuki tried to make Ryu rush for her so that she could counter him, as 
she did know that this was the only sure way to beat him in a serious 
battle. But she also knew that Ryu rarely did such a thing, if he 
wasn&#146;t certain to hit. 

&quot;I don&#146;t wish to fight you! Do as you like, but I hope I won&#146;t have to 
defend myself.&quot; 

&quot;That&#146;s great!&quot; Ibuki said thinking she would win easy enough if she 
got some free hits. 

The ninja rushed against Ryu and went for as sliding spin kick. Ryu 
sidestepped and pushed Ibuki in her back with his palm. 

&quot;I knew it sounded too easy to be true.&quot; Ibuki thought and rolled up 
to her stance again. &quot;But why didn&#146;t he hit her, from such a great 
angle.&quot; 

Ryu did nothing, he just stood with his arms at his sides, facing the 
ninja from the side. Another go... Ibuki thought of Sakura and rushed 
at him again. This time she would knock him. 

Three low punches, a high kick and&#133; falling. Ryu redirected the three 
punches and slid under the kick for a connecting sweep. Not wanting to 
give up Ibuki jumped to her feet as soon as she landed and threw 
herself towards, vaulted and split kicked. (Just like Kim Kaphwan&#146;s 
crescent kick.) 

Missing again she rolled back and again threw several punches. Ryu 
redirected them, but as Ibuki did a low-sweep-into-roundhouse he 
sidestepped again, blocked the spinning Ibuki and pushed her in the 
stomach with his palm. Ibuki fell and had to roll back once again. 
This time she stayed though. 

&quot;This is impossible! And why isn&#146;t he hitting me??? Is he playing with 
me?&quot; Still having some respect for her opponent, not wanting to injure 
him to death Ibuki grabbed some stones out of her pouch and held them 
tight. How would she have him attacking her first? 

&quot;Well Ryu, having anyone to beat lately. Ken seemed to be a better 
fighter than you, at least he is not afraid of attacking properly!&quot; 
The Shotokan warrior said nothing. 

&quot;Or Akuma! That&#146;s one that doesn&#146;t pull on his punches!&quot; 

Really meaning to upset Ryu by taunting him Ibuki was really reminding 
the warrior how few fights he had been in lately. 

&quot;Hmpf, If you could get a decent hit for once I might think about it!&quot; 
He replied coldly. Ryu thought that he didn&#146;t want to fight someone 
unable to defend herself properly, more likely though, he wouldn&#146;t 
combat someone that wouldn&#146;t put up with a good fight. 

This drew the ninja mad, she wasn&#146;t getting anywhere, she would have 
to fight dirty in order to stand a chance. It was against Ibuki&#146;s 
principles though, but at the moment it seemed like the only way. 

&quot;Fine, I really wanted to go easy on you but you don&#146;t give me much of 
choice!&quot; Ibuki threw a rock intentionally too high to hit. 

&quot;Here&#146;s for me!&quot; She shouted. 

Ryu looked at the rock swishing just above his head, he wondered why 
it came in such a bad angle. 

&quot;And this one&#146;s for Sakura!&quot; Ibuki said low as she threw another one. 

&quot;Saku&#133;? Oof!&quot; The rock hit Ryu straight on his head with a *crack* 
leaving a scar. The Shotokan warrior stumbled as he recovered from the 
rather painful hit. 

&quot;Ninja, what is this all about!?&quot; Ryu asked trying to ignore the pain. 

&quot;Me beating you!&quot; Ibuki jumped in the air throwing everything she got 
at him. Knives, rocks small blades, shurikens, darts some small swords 
and three stun-grenades. She didn&#146;t care about dignity at all any 
longer, as long as she would get the headband nothing else mattered. 

Ryu rolled to the side as he tried to get out of the way, then running 
towards Ibuki as she was about to land, avoiding getting hit all the 
way there. 

&quot;Sho-ryu-ken!&quot; He screamed as he knocked Ibuki out of the air. It 
flashed before the ninja&#146;s eyes as she got struck. She landed badly 
but still jumped to her feet trying to continue. But as 

soon as Ibuki stood up Ryu attacked once again. 

&quot;Tatsumaki-senpuu-kayaku!&quot; Three spinning kicks knocked her down for 
the last time. 

&quot;Damn you Ryu, now I will never get it!&quot; She cried waving her arms and 
legs. 

&quot;Get what? Why did you challenge me anyway?&quot; Ryu said while adjusting 
his gloves waiting to see if the battle was finished or not. 

&quot;Damn you, damn you, damn you, DAMN YOU! I just wanted to defeat you 
so I could take your headband!&quot; 

&quot;My headband? Why would you want that, are you another one of those 
annoying idols of mine?&quot; Ryu said in a calm voice. As he did Ibuki was 
even more frustrated. 

&quot;Of course NOT you idiot! I just wanted the headband for&#133; for&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Sakura, right? But tell me something, why are YOU getting it.&quot; Ryu 
turned his head away from the frustrated ninja. 

&quot;Because I&#133; I&#133; That&#146;s none of your damned business!&quot; 

&quot;Well, If you&#146;d asked for it from the beginning&#133; I&#146;d given it to you. 
Sayonara, ninja.&quot; The white dressed warrior picked up his nearby bag 
and started to walk away. 

&quot;Hey come back here you coward!&quot; Ibuki couldn&#146;t find enough strength 
to rush after so she grabbed her last rock and threw it against him as 
a final attempt to stop him. Strangely enough Ryu didn&#146;t turn to block 
it, even stranger it hit him in the head and the Shotokan warrior fell 
to the ground with a soft moan. 

&quot;H-Hey what! R-Ryu, a-a-are you okay.&quot; He didn&#146;t answer. 

&quot;Wh&#133; wha&#133;! Hey, I-I did it!&quot; Ibuki stood up too tired to jump, and 
walked towards the injured Ryu. 

&quot;Is he just faking&#133;? Maybe he&#146;s dead!&quot; Ibuki turned Ryu over to his 
side and checked his pulse. &quot;Phew&#133; maybe I overestimated my power&#133; 
Well, I got his headband now. Finally Sakura might be mine. Sigh&#133;&quot; 
Ibuki said to herself pulling off Ryu&#146;s headband. 

&quot;Sorry I had to beat you, it is not that I wanted to hurt you or 
anything. And it was nothing personal. I just thought it was only way 
I&#146;d get Sakura to like me and&#133; well, you wouldn&#146;t understand. Ehh, 
good luck I guess and&#133; I hope you didn&#146;t hear too much of what I just 
said.&quot; Ibuki suddenly noticed the crowd around her, consisting mostly 
of young men. 

&quot;What the hell are you looking at! Leave me alone!&quot; Ibuki vaulted into 
a nearby shadow and disappeared. A second later Ryu opened his eyes. 
He patted his head and rolled to his back. 

&quot;Good luck ninja, I hope you get what you desire. And of course for my 
own sake that Sakura get something else to think about.&quot; He stood up, 
shook his head and went to a store to buy a new headband and food 

*** 

&quot;I did it, I did it, I did it! Mai, I really beat him!&quot; 

&quot;That&#146;s great, did you get it?&quot; 

&quot;Oh Yes! I can&#146;t wait until tomorrow! Mmmm! Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!&quot; 
Ibuki hugged herself while she repeated the name over and over again. 
She tasted the name with her lips several times, with her tongue she 
tasted them, and with her tongue she tried to imagine Sakura&#146;s breath 
against them. 

&quot;Mai-san. I am so happy! Weeehhh! I don&#146;t know what to do!&quot; Ibuki spun 
around of happiness stretching her arms out. 

&quot;I am so glad for your sake, and if you have some time over, maybe you 
could spar with me, hmm?&quot; 

&quot;Anytime Mai-san!&quot; Ibuki took a stance resembling Dan&#146;s and Mai 
couldn&#146;t help laughing. 

*** 

(This is a special scene written and added for all you Mai Shiranui 
fans. Guess I had to include one of these.) 

As Ibuki got back to her room she was all sweaty from the training 
with Mai. It was dark as she got into her room and opened the door for 
the bathtub. Still breathing hard she put on the water and went back 
to her bed so that she could take of her clothes. As she was halfway 
trough, only wearing black panties and bra, Mai stepped into the room. 

&quot;Huh&#133; Who&#146;s there!!!&quot; Ibuki took a blanket and covered as much her 
body as she could. 

&quot;Relax it&#146;s only me&#133;&quot; Mai whispered. 

&quot;But I&#133;&quot; Ibuki tried to look away, but Mai grabbed her chin and looked 
at her. 

&quot;Besides, we&#146;re both girls right?&quot; Mai said and smiled. She was 
wearing a silk kimono in a dark blue color. And Ibuki noticed a dragon 
mark at the back. (As the one on the floor from Geese Howard&#146;s stage 
from Fatal Fury Special. B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!) 

&quot;R-right&#133; but&#133; that&#146;s&#133; just&#133; the problem.&quot; Ibuki tried to pull away 
thinking of Sakura. 

&quot;What, why?&quot; Mai grabbed her again. 

&quot;B-b&#133; Because every time I come close to&#133; another woman&#133; like you&#133; 
It&#146;s not that I don&#146;t love Sakura! B-but&#133; when I&#133; I&#133; I&#133;&quot; Ibuki&#146;s 
stomach felt like butterflies. 

&quot;Shh! Are you ashamed of me being here?&quot; Mai whispered now only 
centimeters away from her face. 

&quot;No no, it&#146;s not that, it&#146;s just&#133; I-I don&#146;t know what I will do, when 
you are&#133; you know&#133; close&#133; to&#133; me&#133; and I am not wearing any&#133; clothes&#133;&quot; 
Ibuki was really excited and didn&#146;t want to risk doing anything too 
harsh, she was looking away as much as se could. 

&quot;Do you like being here?&quot; Mai said and put a finger on the shivering 
Ibuki&#146;s chin. 

&quot;Of course, I just&#133; ah&#133;&quot; She swallowed hard as Mai took her hand and 
placed it inside the kimono against her chest. &quot;I-I-I-I&#133; gh gh&#133;&quot; Now 
even Ibuki&#146;s voice started to shiver, she was so tense she felt as she 
had a fever. 

&quot;Do, you know what to do if, I mean when, you get close to Sakura?&quot; 

Ibuki relaxed a little. &quot;N-no&#133; eh&#133; why?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;Well, you want to show her how much you love her?&quot; Mai asked as she 
pressed Ibuki&#146;s hand against one of her breast. Ibuki shivered once 
more but managed to get enough strength back to calm her voice down a 
little. 

&quot;Of course&#133; b-but how do I do that&#133;?&quot; 

&quot;I can show you how to make her feel good, and even wonderful. If that 
is what you want of course.&quot; Ibuki and Mai were so close that their 
nose-tips touched each other. The ninja&#146;s hand still shivered. It felt 
so hot touching Mai&#146;s naked breast. All her life Ibuki had wanted to 
know what it felt like. Their bodies felt like fire against each other 
and Ibuki was already sweating. 

&quot;Y-Yes&#133; I&#146;d like&#133; that&#133; very much.&quot; She said. 

Ibuki had to fight hard not to throw herself over the kunoichi and 
make love to her, but as Mai said, she didn&#146;t exactly know how. Mai 
noticed the small ninja&#146;s reactions, but she wanted to be easy on the 
younger girl. She slowly pulled Ibuki&#146;s head to her shoulder and 
carefully kissed her head. Ibuki was terrified being so close to 
another woman but yet it felt very nice. 

&quot;Ibuki-chan, you are very beautiful.&quot; The kunoichi whispered and began 
stroking the ninja&#146;s hair. It was soft and easily stroked, yet stiff 
as it was tied hard, Mai could feel Ibuki&#146;s tension melt away with 
each stroke. 

&quot;Anyone would want you, sometimes even I am jealous at you, for being 
so cute&#133;&quot; Ibuki giggled as she heard this. 

&quot;You really think so? You don&#146;t think I am just a kid?&quot; 

&quot;No I don&#146;t.&quot; Mai said seriously. 

&quot;I think you are a very handsome young girl, and Sakura should be very 
grateful for having such an adorable and wonderful fan. 

Ibuki was happy for Mai&#146;s compliments and felt secure in her arms. All 
the tension was now gone and Ibuki wanted to stay like this forever. 
But, she also kept thinking of Sakura. How she would learn how to make 
love to her friend? She lifted her head and looked deeply into the 
kunoichi&#146;s eyes. She saw only friendship and love trying to figure out 
if Mai wanted this. 

&quot;M-Mai?&quot; 

&quot;Yes my dear ninja?&quot; Mai said with a soft voice. 

&quot;Can you show me? H-How t-to&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Very well then.&quot; Mai wasn&#146;t about to wait for anything that would 
take time at this moment. She grabbed Ibuki&#146;s head leaned over her 
pushing the younger nninja to her back. She placed her fingertip at 
Ibuki&#146;s nose and blew gently into her mouth as she gasped. Mai then 
pulled Ibuki&#146; hand out of her kimono and kissed it. 

&quot;You always were my favorite student&#133;&quot; She said and suddenly pressed 
their lips together. 

&quot;Mmmhmmm!&quot; Ibuki was shocked by the overwhelming sensation of Mai&#146;s 
lips against her. However the small ninja soon relaxed and enjoyed the 
feeling of another woman against her. She tried to picture Sakura but 
it felt wrong for some reason. This was Mai. Her sensei and friend, 
and she was astonishing. Sakura could wait, just a little bit. Ibuki 
hummed as Mai began stroking her hair with one hand. With long and 
soft strokes she made Ibuki even more comfortable and she got some air 
before resuming her activities. 

After a long hard kiss Mai broke loose and looked deep into Ibuki&#146;s 
eyes. 

&quot;Okay&#133; first you kiss her like this. If she indeed wants you it will 
sweep her of her feet. Now open your mouth so I can show you.&quot; Ibuki 
did so and Mai kissed her again and put her 

tongue gently into Ibuki&#146;s mouth. The ninja was really excited by this 
and grabbed Mai&#146;s collar with both her hands in an attempt to pull her 
closer. She could feel their tongues whirling around each other. With 
hard kisses and gentle strokes Mai managed to bring the little ninja 
near the peak, but after a while Mai, to Ibuki&#146;s disappointment, 
stopped kissing her. 

&quot;And then you will have to caress, and kiss her so that she will be 
more aroused, and we can&#146;t do without that now can we?&quot; Mai began 
kissing Ibuki&#146;s neck and circling her hands around the smaller ninja&#146;s 
breasts. Ibuki sighed as she felt the hands touch her caressing, her 
breasts and touching and her nipples through the black clothing. 

&quot;You see&#133;?&quot; Mai said between the kisses. 

&quot;Oh&#133; Mai&#133; it feels so wonderful! Ah&#133; m-motto&#133;&quot; As the kunoichi heard 
this she had her hands sliding along the ninjas sides down and then up 
again a couple of times before she began caressing Ibuki&#146;s breasts 
again. Mai used her thumbs to stroke the hardened nipples with soft 
touches. 

&quot;Mai-san&#133; I want you&#133; haahhh&#133; mmmmhh! I want you so bad&#133; Mai&#133; Mai&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Oh, you will have to be more patient than that!&quot; Mai said and pulled 
away. She wasn&#146;t about to give the younger woman a too early go 
without giving herself something as well. The kunoichi smiled as she 
saw the lust in Ibuki&#146;s eyes. She put out her tongue and ran it over 
Ibuki&#146;s neck hard and then down a bit softer. The smaller girl sighed 
and breathed more and more heavily as the kunoichi let her tongue 
slide down her belly. Mai then untied Ibuki&#146;s bra and went medieval on 
the younger girl&#146;s breasts. Ibuki rose from her position from pure 
ecstasy but was forced down again. 

&quot;And when she is aroused enough, she will be begging for you to take 
her. You with me ne?&quot; 

&quot;Yes&#133; ah&#133; *pant*&#133; *pant*&#133;&quot; Ibuki was so filled with lust she didn&#146;t 
know what to say. The whole world was spinning and the only things 
that existed to her was the sensations that kunoichi was giving her. 
Burning with desire she looked at Mai as she bent over her panties. 

&quot;When she does&#133; well&#133; I&#146;ll show you. If you want&#133;&quot; Mai looked at Ibuki 
and the ninja nodded. After she did Mai smiled and grabbed Ibuki&#146;s 
legs. She spread them and licked her lips in anticipation. After 
taking a good look Mai bent down and took a painfully long lick at the 
outside of Ibuki&#146;s panties. 

&quot;MMMhmmmmm!&quot; Ibuki&#146;s panting and sighing was strong enough for Mai to 
hear her voice. The little ninja was so aroused by just the thought of 
it, another woman taking a taste of her 

most private spot. It was such an incredibly sexy thought, and it felt 
so good. Her panties were all wet by the excitement and Mai&#146;s 
treatment didn&#146;t mean any lack of improvements on that point. She felt 
she had and needed to pull them off but the ninja was too shy. She 
couldn&#146;t bear with the thought of her being totally naked in front of 
her sensei and mistress, even if it was temporary. Mai wondered about 
this and Ibuki told her. 

&quot;Would it be better if I was too?&quot; The kunoichi then asked. 

Ibuki was too astonished to move a lip as Mai began removing her 
kimono. Her velvet soft skin, her beautiful breasts and her all over 
beautiful body. It was all there. Ibuki had thought that Mai&#146;s suits 
hid very little but when she saw the kunoichi fully undressed it felt 
totally different. It was almost too good to be true Ibuki thought. 
She sat up in the bed and leaned against a wall behind her. With open 
mouth and wide eye&#146;s she just looked. She didn&#146;t dare to say or do 
anything that would keep the moment from lasting. She felt her panties 
getting even more soaked, as she was more aroused than she could ever 
recall. 

&quot;What&#146;s wrong Ibuki? Don&#146;t you think I&#146;m good enough?&quot; 

Ibuki swallowed hard as she tried to find the right words. 

&quot;I&#133; I&#133; I&#133; &#133; &#133; N-no&#133; I mean yes&#133;&quot; She began. &quot;I think that you are&#133; eh&#133; 
I can&#146;t come up with words that justifies your beauty.&quot; Ibuki said 
after long thinking. 

&quot;Oh Ibuki! That&#146;s so romantic!&quot; Mai said and grabbed the ninja tightly 
in her shoulders. &quot;Come here you little beautiful thing you!&quot; She 
pulled the smaller ninja close to her body and they kissed once more. 
Ibuki felt their breasts and bodies together and she nearly fainted 
from pure excitement. It was so incredibly sexy. They were really 
close exchanging all kinds of body fluids. She could actually feel the 
kunoichi&#146;s nipples against her. 

&quot;Now get those off!&quot; Mai said suddenly all impatient and grabbed 
Ibuki&#146;s panties and violently pulled them down as far as she could. 
Mai was so excited herself that she had a hard time concentrating on 
the &quot;lesson&quot;. 

&quot;You&#146;re so beautiful&#133; mh, mh&#133;&quot; Mai managed to squeeze between her 
moans. &quot;Now get down there!&quot; She said and pushed Ibuki to her back 
again. She began kissing Ibuki&#146;s tummy and legs violently and 
greedily. Her lips ran across the whole lower part of the ninja&#146;s 
body. This time Mai didn&#146;t even bother for permission for anything but 
plunged into Ibuki&#146;s wet sex without any forewarning. Ibuki barely 
stopped herself from screaming as she made a strong whispery sound 
instead while arching her whole body. 

It tickled a little and the small ninja wasn&#146;t used to the sensation 
of someone&#39;s tongue deep inside her. Mai kissed the spot gently a 
couple of times and then forced her way in again. Her whole mouth was 
covering Ibuki&#146;s sex and it looked like she was eating it. Ibuki began 
to move violently as if to shake loose the older kunoichi but Mai held 
her tight and sucked harder on the shuddering ninja&#146;s labia. Just as 
Ibuki began to see stars and feeling a great sensation building up 
inside her incredibly fast Mai stopped. Ibuki sighed deeply as the 
caught air she had kept in preparation for the orgasm disappeared. 

&quot;Hey what are you doing!?&quot; She yelled. Mai licked her lips and lay 
back. 

&quot;I&#146;ll show you a trick.&quot; She said and put her index finger into 
Ibuki&#146;s mouth. 

&quot;Now take my finger and make sure it&#146;s really slippery.&quot; 

Ibuki did as she said and slowly began sucking the finger and licking 
it with her tongue. 

&quot;Oh, you&#146;re so cute!&quot; Mai said. She really enjoyed Ibuki trying to 
lick her finger like a professional. Her little body moved slowly in 
the same phase as her sucking. Mai knew it was more than enough but 
she held the smaller ninja at holster for a while. As she had done 
this she pulled her finger back and told Ibuki to lean against her as 
much as she could. Ibuki did and they came in opposite positions than 
before. Mai was lying on the bed and Ibuki was on top of her. 

&quot;Now spread your legs so that you knees touch my sides.&quot; Ibuki did and 
then Mai grabbed her 

hips and separated them as much as she could. 

&quot;Now this might feel a bit strange at first but it&#146;s a good stimulant 
that you won&#146;t forget. I&#146;ll tell you more about how to use this 
technique some other time. Now you should just enjoy.&quot; 

Mai stretched her hands towards Ibuki&#146;s hips and then slowly 
penetrated Ibuki&#146;s smaller hole. It was just a bit to show her how 
good it could prove to as extra stimulation but Ibuki sighed deeply 
before she was halfway. 

&quot;Some may like this and some hate it.&quot; Mai said and pushed deeply. 

&quot;Uuuhh&#133;&quot; Ibuki&#146;s expression showed that she wasn&#146;t of the later 
alternative. 

&quot;Anyway, that&#146;s a good start.&quot; The kunoichi said with an eager voice 
and pulled it out. Ibuki moaned as she felt the loss so quickly. Mai 
wasn&#146;t cruel however and immediately placed Ibuki in a new position. 
She placed the small ninja so that she was on her knees and bending 
towards. 

&quot;What is this Mai?&quot; Ibuki asked a bit nervous when not seeing what the 
kunoichi did. Mai didn&#146;t answer however and soon Ibuki felt something 
inside her. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; She moaned as she felt Mai&#39;s fingers beginning to tease both her 
holes at the same time. 

&quot;This is&#133; oh&#133; really&#133; mmmmh&#133; nice.&quot; Ibuki managed to squeeze through 
between her moans. She felt Mai&#146;s lips against her back and this 
combination was the most erotic that the ninja had ever experienced. 
Mai pushed harder and deeper into her lover and just as Ibuki began to 
moan for real she pulled out and turned her over again. 

&quot;Oh, Ibuki I want you so bad!&quot; She said and kissed Ibuki passionately 
before the younger girl could answer. She was too aroused to remember 
anything about the &#145;lesson&#146; for the time being. At least until she had 
gotten some satisfaction. She spread Ibuki legs placed her own right 
leg over Ibuki&#146;s left. Ibuki was sweating all over and panting like a 
horse, but she still possessed enough mentality to wonder what her 
former sensei was up to now. 

&quot;I really like you&#133;&quot; Mai said obviously totally lost in the lust that 
had been building inside her. 

&quot;I like you too Mai&#133;&quot; As Mai heard this she pushed her body down hard. 
Their sexes suddenly pushed against each other and Ibuki moaned out 
loud from the surprise. This was it. She was really, REALLY making 
love to another woman. The cheer tension of the situation hindered 
Ibuki from keeping quiet. It felt all too wonderful for her to be able 
to silently enjoy this. In fact she was nearly screaming as Mai began 
rubbing their clits together. She watched Mai&#146;s euphoric expression 
and tried to bring her closer. 

&quot;Mai&#133; ah, ah, ah&#133; kiss me! Mmmmmhhh&#133; please.&quot; She pleaded. 

Mai seemed to hear this and quickly leaned towards to deliver a very 
wet and passionate kiss. As she did their whole bodies rocked against 
each other. Their breasts caressed the other ones and it seemed like 
there was no end to how pleasurable this happening could be. Their 
pace was now at the peak of how fast Mai could move without falling 
off. She was literally riding the small ninja and she showed no signs 
of stopping without having at least Ibuki cumming. The small ninja 
realized inevitability of the situation and felt an orgasm building up 
incredibly quick inside her. 

&quot;Mai&#133; Mai slow down&#133; I can&#146;t take it much longer&#133;&quot; She moaned. The 
kunoichi didn&#146;t seem to bother however and continued with the same 
pace. The world became all Stars and Stripes for Ibuki and she fought 
really hard not to cum. This was hopeless however since the kunoichi 
was now giving attention to the small ninja&#146;s breasts. 

&quot;Oh&#133; Mai stop it&#133; I&#146;m&#133; I&#146;m cumm&#133;. Mmmmhhh... I&#146;m cumming&#133; I&#133; AAAHHH!&quot; 

The ninja screamed at the top of her lounges as her orgasm was 
flashing through her whole body. It felt so good that she totally lost 
control. She arched her back upwards until her chest met Mai&#146;s. It was 
as if wave after wave of pleasure was flooding from the kunoichi into 
her from the lower access to her body. She clutched her fingers into 
Mai&#146;s neck and they kissed again as Ibuki rode the last of her orgasm. 
As the ninja came to her senses she noticed that it wasn&#146;t over 
however. 

Mai was still thrusting hard against her and their sexes were now 
wetter than ever. Of course this had to do with Mai not cumming yet 
but as Ibuki saw the kunoichi&#146;s expression she knew that it wouldn&#146;t 
be long. Mai made sounds like a wild animal as she placed Ibuki&#146;s hand 
to her left breast. She then put her own hand to Ibuki&#146;s mouth and 
forced a finger in. Ibuki gently sucked it again but was shocked when 
she realized that this was the finger that Mai had used when she had 
been fingering her. 

She felt the sweet taste from her own juices inside her mouth and she 
had to admit to herself that this was indeed very erotic. Mai nearly 
roared as her eyes began to tingle and she arched her head back as she 
was about to cum. The pace was slower and as Mia came she trusted 
against the helpless ninja, one, two and three times before she came. 
With a large moan of ecstasy her whole body shuddered and she trusted 
against Ibuki very slowly but much harder. 

&quot;Oh&#133; Mai&#133; stop&#133; you&#146;re making&#133; me&#133;&quot; 

The sight of the orgasming kunoichi and their throbbing sexes still 
pounding against each other made the small ninja cum once again, even 
harder than the last time. Ibuki closed her eyes and bit her lip not 
to scream. She tasted blood and sighed deeply several times as the 
waves of pleasure flooded through her. 

&quot;Mai-saaaaan!&quot; Ibuki screamed not being able to hold herself any 
longer. As Ibuki panted and took three hard breathes at the end of her 
most recent orgasm arching with each breath. After the third she 
stayed down. 

&quot;Ohhh&#133;&quot; Mai once again kissed the panting ninja. They were breathing 
too hard to make it last very long however. Mai lifted her leg and 
pulled away once. As she did Ibuki noticed a strand of something 
slippery still connecting their sexes. It disapeared however and Mai 
lay down beside her former learner. 

&quot;Was it good for you too?&quot; Mai asked still all sweaty and panting. 
Ibuki nodded but didn&#146;t talk about her having two orgasms in a row. 

&quot;You up to some more?&quot; Mai then asked. 

Ibuki nodded once more and Mai ordered her to take the same position 
on top of her as earlier. She was going to show some advanced 
techniques, as she knew that Ibuki had always been a fast learner. 
Ibuki bit her lip in anticipation as she once again sat at the 
kunoichi&#146;s waist spreading her legs as much as she could. Mai smiled 
and placed her fingers on Ibuki&#146;s lips. 

*** 

Several hours later the couple went for a bath to clean them selves up 
a bit from the rather exhausting day. Ibuki went to bed rather late 
but she was happy when she thought about all the pleasures she could 
give Sakura. 
  
  

Ibuki bounced out off bed as she realized it was morning. She jumped 
into her school uniform, grabbed a sandwich, tied the headband to her 
wrist and went off to school. 

&quot;Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, Sakura&#133;&quot; Echoed trough her mind all the way. 
She came to the school and immediately began looking for her 
soon-to-be girlfriend. She found her walking by herself trough the 
main corridor. 

&quot;Sakura-san!&quot; She shouted. 

&quot;Ibuki-chan! How nice to see you! Where have you been lately?&quot; Sakura 
waved and smiled at Ibuki as she approached. 

&quot;Sakura-chan, happy birthday, *pant*&#133; *pant*&#133; I brought you a present. 
&quot; 

&quot;A present, for me? Oh, how nice of you to remember!&quot; Sakura said with 
a voice like an angel to Ibuki. The ninja smiled and quickly grabbed 
the headband and untied it. 

&quot;Hmm, a headband?&quot; 

&quot;It&#146;s not any headband, it&#146;s Ryu&#146;s headband.&quot; 

&quot;Ryu&#146;s??? You must be joking! How on earth did you get that!?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I hunted him down, defeated him and took it from him.&quot; Suddenly 
Sakura started to laugh. It was obvious that she didn&#146;t believe what 
Ibuki told her. 

&quot;Hey, I did! Really!&quot; Ibuki said a bit frustrated. 

&quot;Oh come on. I really appreciate the thought though.&quot; Ibuki became 
aware that Sakura didn&#146;t know about her ninja identity. 

&quot;I-I can prove it to you! Just you wait! I will see you later&#133;&quot; 

Ibuki disappeared and changed to her ninja outfit. Coming from behind 
Sakura a moment later she pulled her in to the ladies room. 

&quot;H-Hey!&quot; She shouted. 

The room was quite big and it had several sinks with mirrors above and 
doors to the toilets. The walls where painted in pink and there was 
white tile along the walls stretching about one 

and half a meters up. Inside Sakura saw the outfit and mask of Ibuki; 
she didn&#146;t recognize her though. 

&quot;Hey! Where&#146;s Ibuki and how did you&#133; Huh? Are you a ninja?&quot; Sakura was 
now too astonished to think about her friend. 

Ibuki nodded, but didn&#146;t say anything. 

&quot;Cool, a real one!&quot; 

Ibuki nodded once more and went to lock the door. 

&quot;Hey, what do you want with me!&quot; Sakura was scared by the fact that 
she wouldn&#146;t be able to get out if the Ninja proved to be hostile. 

&quot;Are some kind of weirdo!?&quot; Ibuki shook her head and went back to 
Sakura. &quot;Well, If you are you better know how to fight, because I&#146;m 
studying Shotokan Karate and&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I don&#146;t think that will be necessary.&quot; Ibuki said. 

&quot;I-Ibuki&#133;?&quot; 

&quot;Yep&#133;&quot; 

&quot;You are a ninja?&quot; 

&quot;Yep&#133;&quot; 

&quot;But why haven&#146;t you told me?&quot; 

&quot;I couldn&#146;t, I would&#146;ve had to kill you then.&quot; 

&quot;But-but now, why is now all of the sudden any different.&quot; 

&quot;Because I&#133; I&#133; love you.&quot; 

&quot;Ibuki, I love you too, thanks for the present and&#133;&quot; But she didn&#146;t 
have time to finish the sentence. 

&quot;No&#133; &quot; Ibuki made a wave motion with her had. &quot;What I mean is&#133; that I 
am&#133; IN&#133; love&#133; with you&#133;&quot; 

&quot;What!?&quot; Sakura looked stunned. Ibuki slowly began removing her mask 
and hood while talking. 

&quot;Ever since we&#133; came into the s-same class&#133; I&#133; I&#133; have liked you very 
much&#133; no that wasn&#146;t very good&#133; I&#133; I loved from the first day that I 
saw you. And ever since I found out about you soon having a birthday I 
just&#133; just&#133; couldn&#146;t stop thinking of you&#133; so I figured&#133; If&#133; If I 
could get a perfect present for you&#133; then maybe, just maybe, you would 
like me too&#133;&quot; 

&quot;And the perfect present was Ryu&#146;s headband&#133; right?&quot; Sakura said 
blushing heavily. 

&quot;Yes, and so I went to search for him&#133; It was hard to beat him though, 
that&#146;s one though guy. But anyway, after a hard battle I finally 
managed to stun him just long enough, and that&#146;s when I stole&#133; took, 
his headband.&quot; Ibuki sounded as if she was proud over the victory but 
what her expression and eyes said was different. 

&quot;And you did all that, j-just for me?&quot; 

&quot;Y-yes&#133;&quot; Ibuki looked down. She was really ashamed and felt that she 
had used a cheap trick on her friend. 

&quot;You&#133; you aren&#146;t mad at me or anything&#133;&quot; She said worriedly. 

Sakura&#146;s eyes widened as she heard the question. 

&quot;Mad? Of course I am not mad! Why would I be? Because I am loved by 
the most wonderful person in the world?&quot; Ibuki was shocked. 

&quot;You&#133; you&#133; l-ll-ll-like m-me???&quot; 

&quot;Well, I guess so, you&#146;ve always been so nice to me and everything, 
and this&#133; you coming to tell me you love me&#133; somehow it just makes me 
happy&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Sakura&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Ibuki&#133;&quot; 

For what seemed that several minutes passed, as they just stood there 
bound by each other&#146;s longing eyes. Sakura was holding another girl 
for the first time in her life and she felt Ibuki pressing their 
bodies together as if never to let go. She smiled to the ninja who had 
just stolen her heart. Ibuki smiled back as she lay her head against 
Sakura&#146;s shoulder and moved her arms up 

to encircle the area around Sakura&#146;s shoulders. 

She smelled the sent of her lover and found it to be much like that of 
real cherry blossoms. Ibuki loved it and stood to her toes pressing 
even harder against the young warrior&#146;s body. She closed her eyes 
trying to concentrate on the moment. Feel the body and smell that who 
was Sakura. She quietly got the headband and began tying it around 
Sakura&#146;s forehead. She felt slightly jealous but didn&#146;t bother to ask 
anything about it, she didn&#146;t want to be rude and/or ruin the moment. 

After a while Sakura whispered the ninja&#146;s name and Ibuki slowly let 
go to answer the word. But suddenly as she did their chests bounced 
against each other and they both let off a small moan. Sakura blushed 
by the touch and looked at Ibuki with a nervous glance. The ninja&#146;s 
eyes were calm however and she looked at Sakura as if she tried to 
give all her love in one gaze. She did know that it wouldn&#146;t be enough 
however. 

&quot;Ibuki&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Mhhm?&quot; 

&quot;C-can I&#133; like&#133; kiss you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#133; I guess so&#133;&quot; Ibuki answered feeling very nervous about the entire 
situation. She had waited for this moment for ages, and now it was 
here even. Ibuki trembled as she watched Sakura lean forward to kiss 
her. Their lips touched as if there was a lightning storm, Ibuki felt 
tension in every muscle in her entire body. 

&quot;Mmmmhhhh&#133;&quot; Sakura moaned as she pulled away again. &quot;That was&#133; 
unusual&#133; but I liked it.&quot; 

She liked it! She wanted this! Ibuki held on to Sakura with both her 
hands cooked her head a little and pressed their lips together again. 

&quot;Shackura&#133; hmmf&#133;&quot; Ibuki said after a while trying to get loose from 
the kiss so that she could speak freely. 

&quot;Mhmmm?&quot; Sakura tried to answer still holding on hard to her newfound 
lover. 

&quot;You are so beautiful&#133; mmmhhh&#133; I love you&#133;. But&#133;&quot; Ibuki squeezed 
trough between her moans. Sakura&#146;s eyes widened suddenly and she was 
even more excited as she felt Ibuki&#146;s tongue into her mouth. 

It forced it&#146;s way in and Sakura gently tasted it. It felt wonderful, 
she liked the sent of it and she loved the feeling. 

She tried to do the same and as she did their tongues danced against 
each other and Ibuki opened her mouth wider to get the most out of the 
sensation. They continued with increasing passion and intensity. They 
both knew that this was the moment they had been waiting for all their 
lives. To hold on to the love of their life and never let go. The 
ninja was happy with the positive reaction from Sakura and while they 
were kissing she slowly slid one hand under the soft material of 
Sakura&#146;s shirt. She let it caress the well-toned tummy with one finger 
and then she quickly tickled it. Sakura broke the kiss and grabbed the 
ninja&#146;s arm. 

&quot;He, he, he&#133; Hey, that tickles!&quot; 

Ibuki smiled and shot her hand up and grabbed one of Sakura&#146;s breasts. 

&quot;Uhm&#133; Ibuki?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Class is in five minutes.&quot; 

&quot;Damn!&quot; Ibuki thought. Why now!? She was almost there! &quot;Oh, gosh, we 
better hurry.&quot; She said while reluctantly moving away from Sakura. 

&quot;You go on.&quot; Ibuki said and moved her hands to her hood. &quot;I have to 
change.&quot; 

&quot;Oh I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot; Sakura said and smiled showing her white 
teeth. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t mind watching&#133;&quot;
