<h1>Ibuki's Gift (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sfighter/index.html">Street Fighter</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ravenest.html">Ravenest</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sfighter/ibukigift-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ibuki awakened sweaty and excited from her dream. She bounced out of 
bed and quickly pulled her clothes on. She was happy to say the least. 
Summer was there and today her vacation would start. Sakura and her 
would spend some more time together. Was she happy. 

&quot;Hey Ibuki-san! Today summer training begins!&quot; A well known male voice 
could be heard. Ibuki frowned and was once again reminded of her 
legacy. She was a ninja. 

&quot;I&#146;m coming sensei she said and walked out the door.&quot; Nobody was 
there. The only thing she could see was the balcony that led to the 
ground level and the large training grounds that was surrounded by a 
large Chinese-style building painted mostly in red and white. She 
looked around and found nothing unusual. Where was Eiji this time? 

She grabbed jumped off the balcony and swiftly ran into a dark place. 
His mind games again she thought. Whoever would sneak up behind the 
other&#146;s back would win. If Ibuki won she would get the day off, if 
Eiji won she would have to train. Of course Ibuki didn&#146;t remember 
winning any time. Perhaps her motivation to be with Sakura would help 
her this time. She peered over the grounds and could see his 
silhouette on top of a small tower. Of course he would see her if she 
moved over the open grounds. The tower was about a hundred yards from 
her and the only thing to hide between, a tall pedestal, was too far 
away. 

Ibuki jumped up the wall from where she had come and ran back into her 
room. She opened the window and climbed to the top of the roof. From 
here she would have a better view and hopefully better grounds to move 
on. The roof ended high above the ground and wasn&#146;t flat at all. 
Instead it split and stretched far down. The whole view of things 
reminded Ibuki of the super-fun-happy-slide attraction she had tried 
out in Liseberg while visiting Europe a couple of years ago. The 
height didn&#146;t bother her much, and her balance was tip-top. 

Now where could he be? Of course he would use a hundred of his tricks 
to fool her, but as long as she had her back in the right direction 
the game wouldn&#146;t end. Sometimes it would take all day, and Ibuki 
would have to train all night. 

&quot;Aha there he is!&quot; Ibuki said to herself as she noticed a small figure 
some yards away from her. It looked like he was peering over the roof, 
his back in all the wrong direction. Ibuki smiled to herself and 
swiftly moved along the tall roof. She jumped up to him with the words 
&quot;Got ya!&quot;. What she grabbed however was a doll with his clothes. 

&quot;Damn!&quot; She cried and quickly turned around facing an oncoming masked 
assassin. How Eiji could run up the steep roof&#146;s edge was beyond her 
but still she quickly lifted herself up to push him away with a fierce 
kick. No holds barred, win by whatever means they used to say. Of 
course it was dangerous as hell kicking someone down a 3 floors high 
roof but Ibuki was sure he would manage. 

&quot;Better luck next time!&quot; Eiji said with a grunt and fell down the 
edge. No time to loose. She would use Ryu&#146;s own trick against him this 
time. How would she manage however? If she got back to fetch her 
clothes he would find her on the way. She knew he would be gone in 
seconds so she had to think fast. 

&quot;Just wait and I&#146;ll get ya.&quot; She cried and tore the doll&#146;s clothes 
off. She quickly stripped out of her own and put them on the doll. 

&quot;Hiya!&quot; She cried and threw the doll over the edge. 

&quot;Sho!&quot; She heard from below as Eiji instinctively attacked the falling 
fake. Ibuki followed herself seconds later and found Eiji on the 
ground holding on to the doll looking around. She landed on his back 
and put a finger between his shoulders. 

&quot;BANG you&#146;re dead!&quot; She said with an excited voice. &quot;What about that 
one? Eh?&quot; 

&quot;Well it was pretty good.&quot; A cold voice said behind her. It was Eiji&#146;s 
and she found she had stabbed a doll replica again. Its head was 
attached to some sort of screw making it move around. 

&quot;Awww, damn not again!&quot; The small ninja cried in defeat. He had used 
Ibuki&#39;s own trick against her. And it was so simple, she hoped he 
would be ignorant enough to fall for it and it turned out the 
opposite. 

He poked her back and for some reason got his finger caught in the 
clasp of her bra. 

&quot;Hey what are you doing? Here I go make a little sacrifice to win and 
you have to tease me for it?&quot; Ibuki said her face all red. 

Eiji managed to get his finger loose but accidentally unclasped her 
bra in the process. The black item of clothing fell to the ground and 
Ibuki blushed even more. 

&quot;What&#146;s with you anyway?&quot; Ibuki said and stood up and began putting it 
on again. She then noticed Eiji staring at her, and she even noticed a 
small blush from underneath his mask. Eiji said nothing and turned 
around quickly. 

&quot;Uhm&#133; it was an&#133; uhm&#133; good attempt&#133; the *cough* best so far&#133;&quot; Ibuki 
still starred at him. &quot;Youcantakethedayoff, bye.&quot; Eiji said with one 
word and then threw a smoke bomb into the ground disappearing into the 
cloud. 

Left was Ibuki somewhat speechless, but excited in a strange way. She 
shook her head and got her suit back on. She was going to visit a 
little friend over hers. 

&quot;Hu!&quot; She said while jumping on to the wall and bouncing off it. 

*** 

&quot;Hmmm, very interesting.&quot; Bison said as he looked at the monitor. 
There he could see Ibuki jumping around through the woods bouncing off 
tree&#146;s and moving forward at a remarkable pace. 

&quot;Hey move the spy cam you idiot!!! She&#146;s heading right&#133; oh well I 
guess we&#146;ll have to buy a new one.&quot; 

Bison sighed as he wondered where he had got his incompetent spying 
personnel. He turned around quickly and left the dark monitor room. 
Vega quickly met up with him, bowed, and wondered what he could do to 
serve his master. 

&quot;Hmmm, fetch me the clones. I got an assignment for them. Pick, uhm, 
the 2 best you can find. And then make them ready for a observation 
mission.&quot; Bison and smiled evilly as he suddenly felt a plan shaping 
in his head. His face lit up into an evil grin as Vega hurried down 
the hall. 

&quot;Why didn&#146;t I ever think of this before?&quot; He said to himself. &quot;But of 
course, it will need a test mission to see if the clones fit.&quot; 

Bison laughed evilly as he got back to his quarters while Vega headed 
the other way. As he got in to his private room Bison realized that 
the lights were out. He tried turning the light on but to no avail. 

&quot;Section 28 Idiots! I have no power in my room&#133;&quot; There was a small 
clicking noise and a small hum. &quot;Thank you&#133;&quot; 

He went into the room and walked up to something covered in a blue 
blanket. He pulled it off to reveal a shivering being inside a rusty 
cage. 

There he had kept Cammy for future uses. She had betrayed him once and 
normally she would be killed for treachery, but Bison lacked a pet, 
and so he found a new use for her. The young girl snarled at him as he 
got into the room and took off his cloak. 

&quot;Ah, how was your day my pet?&quot; He asked and kicked the cage with his 
foot making it shake for a while. Cammy just growled and tried to get 
his foot. She foamed of rage but didn&#146;t seem to be able to speak 
properly. She had been locked in there for weeks and now acted more 
like a crazed animal. 

In ignorance Bison kicked the cage again and this time Cammy got hold 
of it and bit him right through the leather of his boot. Bison 
screamed in agony and watched as blood sipped from the furious girl&#146;s 
mouth. 

&quot;Damn you, you bitch, I&#146;ll make you pay for that!&quot; Bison cried and 
sent a shock of psycho power into his attacker. Cammy screamed in 
agony and growled in pure hatred as she retreated further into the 
small cage. 

&quot;So, you still got no respect for you master eh?&quot; Bison said with a 
furious voice and grabbed a cane that was located behind the door. 
&quot;I&#146;ll show you who is the man in this house, even if it will take me 
all year!&quot; 

Cammy suddenly got quiet at the sight of this. She shivered and 
retreated as far into her cage as she could then covering as much of 
her body as she could with her shattered arm pads and legs. 

She was strong, the strongest he had ever met in fact. But he was 
going to make her his pet by whatever means possible. And Bison 
admitted to himself that he did enjoy their little moments together, 
when she finally would give up he would surely grow to miss them. 
Bison opened the cage and found Cammy curled up in the farthest end of 
it with tears running down her cheeks. 

&quot;Not coming out to take your punishment this time either I see.&quot; The 
large man grabbed the ceiling of that cage and flipped it 90 degrees 
to make Cammy fall out of it. &quot;You know what that means!&quot; He said with 
an evil grin as he the weak figure trying to crawl for a shelter. 

*** 

Ibuki bounced off the last tree and crashed into the window on the top 
floor of the house she was aiming for. She seemed surprised and rolled 
along the floor just managing not to cut herself to shreds as the 
glass covered the newly cleaned floor. 

&quot;What the HELL do you think you&#146;re doing???&quot; A familiar voice said. 
Ibuki got up and looked around feeling kind of dizzy. The floor was 
made of a pink floor-mat and felt like fur when stepped on, the room 
was mostly colored damp white and it looked a lot like hers. 

&quot;This is the right address right?&quot; Ibuki said and traced the source of 
the voice. Sakura was located on the side closest to the balcony where 
the window had been. She looked with shock in her eyes, first at the 
window, then at the mat, and lastly at Ibuki. 

&quot;Yes&#133;&quot; She said. 

&quot;Good, then why didn&#146;t you leave the window open like I told you to!&quot; 
Ibuki said picking out some glass from her skin. It hurt like hell but 
she didn&#146;t bother too much about it and shrugged it off. 

&quot;Oh, I&#146;m so sorry I&#133;&quot; Sakura started as if to excuse herself for not 
opening the window. 

&quot;And why haven&#146;t I got my kiss yet?&quot; Ibuki said abruptly. Sakura 
hurried to hug her friend and traced a longing kiss to Ibuki&#146;s lips. 

Sakura had gotten more used to this since Ibuki had offered her love a 
few weeks ago. They hadn&#39;t had much time to do much however other when 
Ibuki had dropped by and they had cuddled and kissed for a while. 

&quot;Mmmmh, that&#146;s better.&quot; The ninja said and stroked her girlfriend&#146;s 
hair. &quot;I see you are still fond of the headband I gave you.&quot; 

Sakura blushed and smiled. &quot;Mhm!&quot; 

&quot;Care to learn a new game?&quot; Ibuki said and pulled the bandana over 
Sakura&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Sakura wondered what this was all about but Ibuki wouldn&#39;t let 
her see. 

Ibuki had plans for her. She finally had time to exercise her lusts 
for the girl but this place wouldn&#39;t do. The window was open and all, 
Ibuki looked around and then thanked the architect of Sakura&#39;s house 
for building a bathroom that could be entered through her room. 

&quot;Lets go.&quot; She said. &quot;I am sure you will love this.&quot; 

*** 

Vega was on his way back to the entrance of the monitor room as he 
suddenly heard a scream. The two clones following closely behind 
didn&#146;t seem to bother but stopped at the same time he did. 

&quot;Juni, was that one of ours?&quot; Vega quickly asked as feelings of duty 
washed over him. The light haired woman replayed the sound in her head 
and quickly informed him that the voice belonged to the 22nd clone in 
the original squad. 

&quot;Cammy? Impossible, she was reported missing after the Charlie 
mission! What is she doing here?&quot; Vega turned around and looked at the 
clones. 

&quot;She must be after Bison!&quot; He thought knowing that not all that many 
was very fond of their boss, especially not those that had failed a 
mission once. &quot;Find where she is and bring her to me. I will go to 
Bison&#146;s quarters to assure his safety. You have five minutes to inform 
me of her location. Got it?&quot; 

The clones looked at each other, nodded, and was on their way. Vega 
hurried through a shortcut hidden behind a large monitor. If the 
clones just had a little more personality he would love to be around 
them. Of course he enjoyed ordering them around for all kinds of silly 
tasks but he also liked them doing their job since they were so 
efficient. And Juli was rather cute too. He smiled and thought about 
it, maybe he could order them to use their superb bodies for some 
interesting gymnastics. Vega chuckled and hurried down the secret 
hall. But of course Bison, he was reminded of the fact that he had a 
boss, would never allow that. 

As he got out from behind the second monitor Juni and July came 
running down the same hallway he came from. 

&quot;What are you doing here? This is Bison&#146;s quarters, I told you to look 
for Cammy!&quot; Another shriek from inside the door answered his question. 
&quot;Oh well, July, take the lead and I&#146;ll follow. Did you bring any guns? 
Good girl!&quot; 

The blonde man took a slight pause enjoying the feeling of leadership. 
He fastened his mask and made sure his claw was were it should be. 

&quot;CHARGE!!!&quot; 

Inside they found Bison in full motion of assaulting the woman known 
as Cammy. He used a large cane to beat her with and she was bleeding 
from the injures. She was very quiet considering the immense amount of 
beating she had taken, but whenever he hit her back or sides she cried 
out in a glass shattering shriek. 

Many thoughts were going through Vega&#146;s head for the first few seconds 
as he saw this. What was going on? What was that cage doing in here? 
Had this been going on for a long time? And in that case why hadn&#146;t he 
noticed before? The blonde man was filled with disgust as he snapped 
out of it. Why was Bison beating his beautiful clones, they never did 
anything wrong. 

He looked at Juni and July. They were armed with heavy duty machine 
guns and ready to fire any second. They seemed to hesitate though. 
They were obviously confused with the situation seeing their leader 
assaulting one of their own. Juni relaxed her aim and looked up at 
Vega with only confusion in her eyes. Vega noticed a weak sign of 
feeling in her eyes, pitty. 

&quot;Uhm&#133;&quot; Vega coughed. This made the usually cool July fire a shot by 
mistake that hit the wall. 

Although it had only gone about 3 seconds since they stormed through 
the door a whole lot of things were happening in each of their heads. 
Except for Bison who was blinded by the perverted joy of beating Cammy 
to a bloody mess. He got to his senses though and looked back at them. 

Vega removed his mask and looked at Cammy lying on the floor barely 
conscious. He looked at the cane, at the end there was a skull covered 
with small spikes. Of course he loved women and didn&#146;t like them being 
beat up, well of course he would love to pulverize Chun-Li, but that 
was personal. And these were the clones, the only friends he had in 
this place. 

&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Bison suddenly said thinking they were 
planning to assasinate him. However he could use a good battle before 
proceeding with his plans. &quot;Get on with it or I&#146;ll have some fun with 
your little friends there too. And then we&#146;ll have to get new one&#146;s 
for the mission. And you do know who would be in charge of the long 
and bor&#133;&quot; 

&quot;July, shoot&#133; and try not to miss this time.&quot; 

*** 

Sliding her hand up from inside Sakura&#39;s shirt she touched her breasts 
and gave Sakura a hint of what she had in mind. &quot;Hope you will like 
it&#133;&quot; Ibuki said, cupped it in her and gently stroked it. Through the 
blue material she could feel the nipple and she gently caressed it 
with her whole hand. Sakura tensed and took a loud breath but didn&#39;t 
say anything. 

Ibuki then lifted Sakura&#146;s shirt up as far as she could and asked her 
to hold it there. The young warrior did and leaned slightly backwards. 
She was really excited but didn&#146;t really know what would happen next. 
The ninja sighed deeply at the view and had both her hands running all 
over Sakura&#146;s stomach and sides. She could barely keep her hands from 
the blue material of 

Sakura&#146;s bra and tickled her lover once again to get off the thought. 
The young warrior giggled again and smiled to her lover. 

&quot;Ibuki&#133; please don&#146;t tease me.&quot; Sakura said sounding rather serious. 

The ninja blushed heavily and looked down to Sakura&#146;s breasts. This 
was it. The moment she had been waiting for. Weeks had gone without 
getting anything. She was able to find the time or courage. She was 
REALLY going to make love to her friend this time however. Ibuki 
swallowed hard and slowly let her hands slide towards Sakura&#146;s covered 
breasts. Her hands trembled as they finally reached their goals. She 
whispered Sakura&#146;s name and gently squeezed them. The warrior arched 
her head back as she felt Ibuki&#146;s hands softly caressing her breasts. 

&quot;Sakura&#133; You truly are wonderful&#133; Say that you will never leave me&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot; Sakura said calmly. 

&quot;Oh&#133; well just remember I love you and only you. I couldn&#146;t live with 
the thought that you would run of with someone&#133; like Ryu.&quot; Ibuki said 
pushing Sakura&#146;s bra up to reveal her longing birds. 
  
  

&quot;I will&#133;&quot; Sakura said feeling really strange with this. While still 
panting she got into the right position. She was a bit embarrassed 
lying totally open like this. And what if someone should hear them? 
They were locked in and all, but still. 

&quot;Ah&#133;!&quot; She felt Ibuki&#146;s thumbs rubbing her nipples and suddenly the 
thing about anyone coming suddenly seemed irrelevant. And Ibuki 
wouldn&#146;t trade this moment for anything in the whole world right now. 
If anyone found them it would be worth it as long as she could keep 
doing that wonderful thing with her hands. She didn&#146;t want to wait she 
needed this NOW. 

Sakura was now breathing really hard and was fighting not to make too 
much noise. It was not getting on pretty well though. As she breathed 
slight moans could be heard. Each stroke from Ibuki&#146;s fingers made her 
more excited and her moans got louder slowly but steadily. As for 
Ibuki she noticed a warm feeling spreading through her body. It was 
getting harder for the ninja girl to concentrate at what she was 
doing. 

She just wanted to please Sakura and give her a really, REALLY good 
time and she wanted to satisfy her own lust while at it. 

&quot;Sakura?&quot; She whispered. 

&quot;Mmhhhm! Yes&#133; ah&#133; haa&#133; what is it&#133; ohh&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I can&#146;t hold it for much longer&#133; I want to take you. I want it so 
badly&#133; But I want you to 

be happy too&#133;&quot; Ibuki stopped for a while. 

Sakura looked at her with blinded eyes. &quot;Uhm&#133; What&#146;s keeping you 
then?&quot; 

That was all the ninja needed to hear. Ibuki lay her arms around 
Sakura and pressed her head against Sakura&#146;s chest. She slowly lifted 
her head and looked at the naked torso of her lover. She engulfed 
every line and shade in Sakura&#146;s body and closing her eyes again she 
bent down and kissed Sakura&#146;s belly. She kissed several times while 
slowly moving upward. Sakura twitched every time Ibuki touched her and 
tried to be still. As the small ninja got to Sakura&#146;s breasts suddenly 
stopped. 

She looked at the young warrior for approval and Sakura looked back 
smiling. Ibuki opened her mouth and quickly dove over Sakura&#146;s right 
breast. She licked the already erected nipple and sucked it fully into 
her mouth. Sakura arched her head back in pure ecstasy as a flood of 
pleasure flowed through her body. Ibuki continued to taste the 
wonderful birds. She licked both of them in turn and was massaging the 
unattended with her hands. This was driving Sakura crazy and she 
nearly came from pure excitement. 

Sweating and shivering she placed her hands to Ibuki&#146;s head as if to 
hinder her from going away. She pressed her fingers hard into the 
ninja&#146;s neck and slowly began hooking her legs around the ninja. Ibuki 
noticed however and decided to stop. She grabbed Sakura&#146;s legs and 
pulled away. 

&quot;Ibuki! What are&#133;&quot; Ibuki placed a finger to Sakura&#146;s lips and hushed. 

&quot;Shhh&#133; I know something that&#146;s even better.&quot; She lifted one of 
Sakura&#146;s legs to her side and grabbed the shoe at the end. 

&quot;I have planned this for days now&#133; &quot; Ibuki said and threw away the 
shoe. She grabbed Sakura&#146;s other leg by the foot and began peeling of 
that shoe as well. 

&quot;You don&#146;t have to tell me&#133; I know how you feel.&quot; Sakura said 
admitting that she too had been both sexually and emotionally 
frustrated over the wait for this to happen. She never knew how to 
express it however but now it seemed she wouldn&#39;t have to. 

Ibuki threw away the other shoe and grabbed Sakura&#146;s hips and pulled 
her closer. They embraced each other and began kissing again. Ibuki 
felt Sakura&#146;s naked breasts against her chest as they once again came 
close enough for physical contact. She sighed and fought hard to stay 
with the kiss and after a while of some serious kissing Ibuki grabbed 
both Sakura&#146;s legs and pulled them up. 

She could finally get to the point. After taking a peek at the center 
between them she bent her own legs and to get a lower profile. She put 
them at her shoulders and gently kissed the sides. Sakura, still 
sitting at the edge of the sink, liked the feeling and began stroking 
her legs against Ibuki. 

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; 

&quot;Oh yes, very much.&quot; Sakura replied as she was getting strangely 
aroused from Ibuki teasing her like this. 

Passionately Ibuki began kissing and nibbling Sakura&#146;s legs while 
slowly moving towards. She sort of walked even with the low profile, 
but with an incredibly low pace. She continued to kiss the sides and 
was really getting aroused thinking of where the trip would end. 
Sakura shivered as she felt Ibuki reaching her inner thighs, still 
kissing and nibbling Ibuki showed no signs of intending to stop. 

&quot;Oh my&#133;&quot; Sakura thought. &quot;If she keeps this up she&#146;ll soon&#133;&quot; 
  
  

&quot;I have an idea.&quot; Ibuki said. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Turn around and bend over the sink.&quot; 

Sakura did as Ibuki told her with some difficulty. As she did so the 
ninja ducked behind Sakura and lifted her skirt. 

&quot;Oh! What are you doing?&quot; Sakura gasped. 

&quot;I will try to make you feel as wonderful as you make me.&quot; Ibuki 
replied with a hungry smiled as she was watching up Sakura&#39;s skirt. 

&quot;Uhm&#133; Okay&#133;&quot; Sakura said nervously as she felt Ibuki move under her. 

Ibuki smiled even wider and like a predator she opened her mouth 
slowly and kissed Sakura&#146;s panties at the bottom. 

Sakura moaned slightly as the new sensation flooded trough her. She 
felt warm and the attention Ibuki was giving her made her sex become 
all warm and wet very quickly. 

The ninja then grabbed Sakura&#146;s legs and held them apart as she knew 
how Sakura might react. She reached out her tongue and again kissed 
the other girl&#146;s panties again. And with her tongue she began licking 
Sakura&#146;s labia trough them. She was really excited by this and 
couldn&#146;t help letting go with one hand and stroking herself. Ibuki 
pulled her pants down a bit and placed her hand appropriately. 

&quot;M-motto&#133; ah&#133; hah&#133;&quot; The young warrior moaned hearing her lover moaning 
in delight with her and she started pulling her panties. Ibuki helped 
and pulling the off she folded them and put them in her pocket so that 
they wouldn&#146;t get lost. 

Sakura bit her lip in anticipation of what might happen. And Ibuki 
swallowed hard. She knew how to do this, she was just worried whether 
or not Sakura would enjoy herself. She licked her lips clean and the 
grabbed Sakura&#146;s legs as hard as she could. 

&quot;I want you Sakura&#133;&quot; She said and lifted the skirt with one hand and 
placed her head underneath. 

&quot;I want you too Ib&#133; ahhhhhh!&quot; Sakura felt something penetrate deep 
inside her. It was Ibuki&#146;s tongue forcefully pressing into her 
incredibly wet sex. &quot;Ohh!&quot; She began breathing hard and tried to be 
still as much as she could. But as she felt Ibuki&#146;s tongue penetrate 
her even deeper she found it becoming harder by each lick. It was the 
first time she was reminded that she was in a lesbian relationship 
since the time in school. She had never thought about it much before 
but now that they intended to have sex Sakura was reminded again. 

Ibuki found the sweet taste of Sakura&#146;s sex very likeable and dreamt 
about doing this all day. 

She liked the feeling of having her tongue into another girl&#146;s sex; it 
was almost as if she was really&#133; taking her. And it was Sakura; Ibuki 
concluded once again feeling like fairies in her stomach. 

Sakura yelped as she began rocking with the pace of Ibuki. The ninja 
tried desperately to hold Sakura still as she continued tongue lashing 
her and after a while Ibuki stopped her lashing for a second and 
kissed Sakura&#146;s hips and other hole. 

&quot;I hope you will like this, just tell me if you don&#39;t and I will 
stop.&quot; She said and began salivating her left index finger by putting 
it into her mouth. It was not enough however and she stood up, bent 
over to the sink and got some fluid soap on the finger. 

&quot;This should be enough&#133;&quot; Sakura looked blindly in wonder but didn&#146;t 
say anything. She trusted her friend not to do anything that she 
wouldn&#146;t like or hurt her. Ibuki spread the soap and massaged it over 
her finger and felt that it was slippery enough. She pulled her pants 
off fully as they were getting in her way trying to move around and 
got behind Sakura again. She grabbed the girl around the waist with 
one arm and pushed the girl down with the other, trying not to be too 
rough. As Sakura bent towards Ibuki let go with her hand around the 
girl&#146;s waist and lifted the skirt up again. She could see her goal and 
gently pressed her soaped finger against it. She could feel Sakura&#146;s 
tension as she did but Ibuki held the other girl down hard with her 
other hand. It might be a bit painful moving around too much she 
thought. Ibuki lifted one of Sakura&#146;s legs up so that her knee was 
lying on the top of the sink. It would probably make the situation 
easier Ibuki thought. 

As Sakura began to relax again Ibuki began to slowly pushing it inside 
while she gently stroked her back with the other hand. The finger 
stopped as Ibuki&#39;s knuckle connected with Sakura&#39;s cheeks. She looked 
at her lover who was moaning slightly, maybe from discomfort. 

&quot;This is kind of kinky&#133;&quot; Sakura said and moved around somewhat. 

&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Ibuki asked nervously thinking her perverted mind 
and defeated her common sense. 

&quot;Its ok:&quot; Sakura said and gasped as she felt the finger roll around 
inside her as it was on its way out. &quot;Do you like this?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah&#133;&quot; Ibuki answered and laughed nervously. 

&quot;Oooh&#133;&quot; Sakura moaned to herself. &quot;I will remember that. She me how 
you do it.&quot; She continued all excited from the thoughts of perhaps 
dominating Ibuki at another time now that she knew what turned the 
ninja on. 

&quot;Sure&#133;&quot; Ibuki whispered and with the finger she then pressed deep and 
hard into Sakura&#146;s ass again. She really enjoyed Sakura succumbing to 
her fetish and also tried real hard to make her enjoy it while doing 
it slowly at the same time. 

After a while when Sakura was moving around with her pace while 
gasping desperately out Ibuki let go of the girl and Sakura 
immediately rose a little adjusting to a better posiition. Ibuki 
grabbed Sakura&#146;s breast with the free hand and pinched the nipple. 
Already getting used to this kind of attention to her birds Sakura 
grabbed the other one with her owns hand and began rubbing it 
frequently. 

She felt Ibuki kissing her shoulders and back. Her clothing was still 
denying much access she could still feel it. Just as Sakura was about 
to cum however she felt Ibuki pulling out of her and leaving her 
breast. A scream that was supposed to be a cry of ecstasy suddenly 
turned into a sigh of grief instead. Sakura looked back but couldn&#39;t 
see Ibuki getting to her knees behind her and feeling painfully 
unsatisfied she nearly growled for the ninja to continue. Ibuki smiled 
and found Sakura&#146;s love button on the way back. She decided she would 
go for the grand finale. With a &quot;slurp&quot; she sucked it into her mouth 
and she could feel Sakura trembling as she did so. 

&quot;More!&quot; Sakura shouted trying with all her might not to be too loud. 
She immediately felt the pleasure coming back into her body and she 
could barely control herself as she felt Ibuki&#146;s mouth all over her 
sex, Ibuki&#146;s hand against her hip and another finger up her ass. 
Teasingly 

Ibuki barely pressed into it and massaged to part gently with another 
finger. This was making the warrior mad with desire and she tried and 
tried not to scream as she felt an orgasm building up incredibly fast 
within her. 

Ibuki started pushing deeper and harder to hopefully satisfy the 
growing hunger of her friend. Sakura felt her ass being filled to the 
limit with Ibuki now pushing two fingers up her while licking. The 
combination of the intrusion of her dirty way and the tongue inside 
her was more exciting than she had ever imagined. 

With Ibuki all over her sex and an incredibly satisfying finger 
someplace else Sakura bit her lips trying to close her mouth. Another 
orgasm was coming and being denied the first one she felt this one 
dwarfing every other pleasure that the girl had ever known. It would 
be easy to get addicted to this sort of thing. 

&quot;Ibuki&#133; you are making me crazy&#133; I&#133; I&#133; will&#133; I&#146;&#133; I&#146;m&#133; I&#146;m cumming!&quot; As 
she felt the orgasm coming, Sakura bent towards and was about to 
scream into the sink, 

hoping that would dampen the sound a little. 

It was of no use though and Sakura&#146;s light screams echoed throughout 
the room. Ibuki was nearly thrown to the floor holding her. With four 
strong spasms trough her body Sakura&#146;s orgasm finally came. She 
screamed long and hard into the sink and almost kicked Ibuki as she 
nearly fell. 

Sakura&#146;s ass cramped around Ibuki&#146;s finger and her hands began 
slamming into the sink. It felt so good that she just wanted to float 
away and sleep. Still shuddering Sakura moaned and felt the last 
essence of the incredibly hard orgasm faint away. After a while the 
tired Sakura fell backwards nearly unconscious but was caught by the 
small ninja behind her. 

&quot;Ibuki, &#133; *pant*&#133; that&#133; huff&#133; was wonderful.&quot; Sakura said between her 
breathing. 

&quot;Thank you my love.&quot; Ibuki said from behind her. 

*** 

Why was he doing this again? Yes of course, his boss was the biggest 
asshole in the country. And besides he himself was the top notch of 
greedy, self-centered, criminal and abusive people on the entire 
planet, besides Vega was an excellent fighter to boot. (With all these 
treats how could Bison resist hiring him?) 

Right now Vega felt good with being a good guy, he would kick Bison&#146;s 
ass, then turn him into the Interpool and he would be a hero. Of 
course that would be short-lasting since he would take over Shadowlaw 
and use it for his personal interest, but that was beside the point. 
The best part was, he&#146;d finally get to kill someone and get away with 
it. Vega guessed he just needed a reason, and now he had one good 
enough, and having the cute Juni and July backing him up would make 
the battle even more sweet. The thought of all of the clones being his 
added to the spanish ninja&#146;s enthusiasm. 

&quot;Uhm, I think you can stop shooting now.&quot; Vega said as he realized 
that July was pumping round after round into Bison&#146;s limp body. &quot;Get 
Cammy out of here and bring her to the lab. Then get the other clones 
here for me. Can you do that in five?&quot; 

The brown haired woman hesitated for a second, then saluted with the 
words: &quot;YES SIR!&quot; And she was on her way. 

&quot;Juni, you stay here and cover me, just in case ok? I loose you shoot 
okay?&quot; Vega said and looked at the still breathing body of his 
current, no &quot;former&quot;, boss. He watched as July hurried out the to the 
hallway carrying Cammy. 

&quot;You idiot! You will never get away with this!&quot; Bison said and stood 
up seemingly unharmed. His clothing must be bullet proof Vega 
confirmed. 

&quot;This is bad. Juni forget your previous order, I&#146;ll keep him busy 
while you engage the security lock for this section. And make sure you 
don&#146;t forget the sound disabler function like captain fatboy here 
did.&quot; Oh how he loved this. &quot;Then randevouz back here and cover me. If 
he is still alive that is.&quot; 

&quot;YES SIR!&quot; The light haired woman answered while saluting. 

&quot;Oh, and see if you can do it in less than five ok?&quot; Vega added as he 
knew they had to be given a time limit to work more efficiently. These 
2 particular clones were specially designed for being able to execute 
every possible tasks in five minutes. Well, needless to say, he would 
prefer less this time around. 

&quot;Impressive, you still have control over them. But now is the time 
that I erase those naive delusions out of your head, permanently!&quot; 
Bison said as he looked with his mad eyes at the clone leaving the 
room. He was naturally frustrated in loosing control of his clones. As 
he was about to use his psycho power to seize control over the 
revolting Juni he was attacked by Vega&#146;s claw. He dodged easily but 
the disruption made Juni get away unaffected. 

&quot;Okay fatboy, let&#146;s have some fun.&quot; 

*** 

Actually Bison wasn&#146;t surprised about his former minion&#146;s behavior at 
all. He was still the treacherous, common side-dealing, gambling, 
lying, egoistic bastard that he used to hire. Of course he would 
expect one of the three to revolt sooner or later. However he was 
suspecting that it would be Sagat, not this cross-styled freak. Well, 
surely his ego was to blame, at least Sagat had some honor. 

&quot;What&#146;s wrong, can&#146;t aim straight?&quot; Vega taunted him as Bison placed a 
kick in a wall which the former bullfighter had been standing by less 
than a second ago. After all, avoiding was Vega&#146;s best treat in the 
martial arts. 

&quot;Well, enough talk, time for the kill.&quot; Vega said and put his mask 
back on. He could either choose from going mental on Bison and 
taunting him to death or go with his ninja style and use pure 
efficiency rather than other tricks. The spanish ninja summoned his 
perfect concentration (matched only by Chun-Li and people hurting his 
face) and figured he&#146;s have to use both these traits. 

&quot;Very clever.&quot; Bison said as he could hear the signal for locking the 
are down. The sound were disrupted to the grade that Vega barely heard 
what his opponent just said, even though there were but a few yards 
away from each other. This was why Vega hadn&#146;t noticed Cammy&#146;s screams 
of agony before, he shuddered at the thought. Oh well, at least now he 
was going to be a hero. 

While standing there thinking Bison got a head start at the fight and 
quickly placed a hard foot in Vega&#146;s mid section. Naturally it hurt 
but Vega&#146;s lightning fast reflexes allowed him to grab the foot and 
twist it. 

Bison jumped backwards and with some sort of reverse flask kick leapt 
out of the hold. Again Vega was hurt, but like a true Bruce Lee fan he 
licked his bleeding lips and charged.
