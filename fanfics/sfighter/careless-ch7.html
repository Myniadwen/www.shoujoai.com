~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was fast approaching deep night at the Rindoukan Dojo. Even though 
the rain had settled for Ibuki; it was rather late for her to leave. 
Thus she was staying until morning. The ninja in training didn&#39;t have 
much in the way of sleeping bags, since she had not expected this much 
time in coming here, only a fight. So she was forced to sleep on one of 
those thin mattresses in one of the four bedrooms of the Rindoukan Dojo. 
It was thin, uncomfortable-looking and cheap, but something that Ibuki 
couldn&#39;t avoid sleeping on. It was better than crashing on the floor. As 
soon as she put her head down; Ibuki was out like a light. Prompting 
Makoto to catch up on some sleep as well. If anything she wanted to be 
ready for the continuation of their battle tomorrow.  She wasn&#39;t really 
prepared this morning. Tomorrow would be much different. For both of 
them. 

The tomboyish young woman left the room in which Ibuki was sleeping, 
sliding the wooden door closed. Then walked down the corridor to her own 
room. She strode in and undressed, thinking back to her fight in the 
morning. It was sort of exciting in its way. She hadn&#39;t had a good fight 
like that in ages. And that was the thing she was seeking most of all. A 
good fight. Not just to restore the reputation of the Rindoukan Dojo... 
but to fuel her own waning battle spirit. But who could give her that 
kind of challenge around here? Most people were ignorant of the Dojo 
right now. And Ibuki had travelled from Kyoto to fight with her. 
Obviously that wasn&#39;t going to happen everyday. 

Makoto peeled off the last of her Gi until she remained only in her 
night wear. Then she climbed under the thin cover of her sole mattress 
of a bed. Then she began thinking to herself about it. About the 
prospect of new challenges. How else would they be able to find her? 

&quot;...Maybe...&quot; Makoto mused, &quot;....I have to be the one to find them...&quot; 

There was no real way around it. That seemed like the only way to repair 
the reputation of the Rindoukan Dojo. And Makoto couldn&#39;t help but smile 
at the idea. If she made a journey to find new challenges and make more 
people aware of the true power of the Rindoukan Dojo... it would solve 
both of her problems. But the more she thought about it, the more it 
excited her. And this excitement was preventing her from getting any 
sleep. Though she tried to get her head down, Makoto was too driven by 
her new ideas to snooze. And when she couldn&#39;t sleep, she did the other 
thing that made her time worthwhile. Train. The short-haired teen rose 
from the covers of her bed and began putting her Gi back on. Once she 
re-dressed herself, she then slid open the door to her room. She gaited 
down the corridor and slid open the door to the indoor training hall. 
Which was basically just a large empty room next to the garden. Though 
there was a confident smile upon the girl&#39;s lips, it vanished when she 
realized that she was not alone. 

There was someone else in that room.

..But it wasn&#39;t Ibuki. 

Makoto looked across the room to see that there was a shadowy figure 
standing around thirty metres from her. Though the rain had died down; 
the thunder and lightning had not. When the lightning broke out and 
illuminated the sky, young Makoto was given a clear view of the outlines 
of this mystery man. He was dressed in a formal business suit, with his 
hands tucked into his pockets. And Makoto could also see that cocky 
smile over his face. But more than that... she could feel the strength 
that was oozing from this man&#39;s every action. She had never felt 
ANYTHING like it before. Whoever he was; he was no pencil-necked 
pen-pusher, that was for certain.

&quot;Who... are you?&quot; Makoto questioned suspiciously. 

&quot;...Excuse me...&quot; The shadow figure spoke coolly, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen 
to be the head of this... fighting establishment, would you...?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;...I am the true successor of the Rindoukan 
Dojo and its fighting art. Once my grandfather passes away I will be the 
head of this Dojo. But just who are you? And why would you need that 
information?&quot;

The shadow placed a hand to his chin. &quot;Hmm... it seems I&#39;ve come to the 
wrong place. My sources were incorrect on location. But that matters 
not. I shall not have come all this way for nothing. Time to see if the 
weaker brood stand up to the powers of a god...&quot;

Then Makoto grew even more suspicious when she felt this man&#39;s fighting 
aura peak. She instantly assumed a fighting stance and grit her teeth. 
&quot;...What are you talking about!?&quot;

&quot;...Get ready to die...&quot; The shadowed man in the business suit spread 
open his arms and his clothes were suddenly ripped away from his body 
into tiny shreds. His hair colour suddenly switched from a bright 
golden-yellow to a grim silver. And his muscular yet lithe body was 
revealed; boasting all of its powers to Makoto. Though she would have 
had no way of knowing it, this man was FAR more powerful than she could 
ever understand. For he was a member of a pseudo-religious society that 
was making waves in the world. Filling the shoes of the late criminal 
organization; Shadowloo. This man was known as Urien. And his powers 
were not to be underestimated. 

Makoto scowled. Whoever this guy was, he was trespassing. And 
threatening to kill her. She had to take him down before he got ahead of 
himself. The large feet of the karateka began charging her towards the 
coffee-skinned powerhouse that was ahead of her. But he showed no fear 
or intimidation whatsoever. Once they were in striking range of each 
other, Makoto leapt off the floor on one foot and swung her other around 
via the hips. Urien smirked at this kick and brought up his right hand. 
His wrist slapped violently into the path of Makoto&#39;s kick and batted 
her leg away. Leaving her open for a brief four seconds. But that was 
more than enough time for Urien to capitalize. He thrust his other hand 
straight into the tomboy&#39;s gut. With more strength than Makoto had ever 
felt before. She cried out and was thrown back into the polished pine 
floorboards of the training room, startled and shocked. Now there was a 
dull ache at her stomach. The girl rolled onto her back and blinked at 
this man, holding her abdomen. She knew that this guy was good from his 
aura but she would have never thought that he was THIS good. 

But Urien wasn&#39;t quite finished yet. The fighter looked upwards and 
jumped straight into the air with all the force of a jet-fighter. 
Makoto&#39;s head cranked backwards to follow his line of ascent. And once 
his jump had reached its peak, Urien flipped around swiftly and began 
descending at bullet-fast speed. With his knees pointing downwards. 
Right at Makoto. 

&quot;Destroy!&quot; He yelled, diving towards the girl with terrible haste. 

The young woman&#39;s eyes widened urgently as she rolled to one side of the 
incoming attack. Seconds later he crashed directly into the floorboards 
of the training room. They were pummelled and shattered beneath both 
weight and velocity like nothing Makoto had ever seen before. Urien 
stood up from the small fissure that his Violence Knee Drop attack had 
created. Makoto stood back up as well and resumed her fighting stance; 
knowing that she could no longer take this man lightly. It was time for 
her A-game. The future successor of the Rindoukan Dojo slipped her eyes 
shut for a brief few seconds and breathed outwards. Cleansing her body 
of all her doubts and worries. Making ready what she needed for the 
attack. Urien smirked at this, saying,

&quot;...Mortal! Do you really presume to launch an assault upon your future 
God?!&quot;

And Makoto didn&#39;t know what the hell Urien meant by that statement; but 
it didn&#39;t matter. She had to force him out of the Dojo now. She spread 
apart her feet and pulled back one of her mighty hands. Then rushed 
forwards with so much speed that even Urien was a little curious. But in 
the split second between launching the Hayate attack and landing it; 
Urien&#39;s trained eyes saw through the bullet-fast speed and accounted for 
it. He charged forwards himself. But he led in with his shoulder and 
right arm, dashing forwards with as much power as Makoto had speed, 
screaming, 

&quot;Crush!&quot;

There was a violent clash of momentum between the two forces of the 
Hayate and the Chariot Tackle. But one did come out as the victor. 
Makoto released a blood-curdling scream when she was batted backwards 
from the collision. He whole body was thrown back so relentlessly that 
she was smashed through the wooden-paper walls of the training room. Her 
trained body glided through the rubble and skidded into the stone of the 
outside gardens. Urien stepped out of the training hall to the outside, 
through the hole that Makoto&#39;s body had made. 

He laughed at the young woman. &quot;Heh, heh, heh... you&#39;re even weaker than 
I thought you would be, peasant. Embrace the earth and bow before your 
new God!&quot;

Makoto groaned heavily, watch her sweat drip to the stone. &quot;Ugh... 
stroke your ego much?&quot;

Not that Urien could really be offended by that. To him, Makoto was 
nothing more than a frightened dog, yapping and barking behind a steel 
fence. She was nothing to him. Not even worth destroying. Not even 
worthy enough to be touched by his sacred fists. And she was only the 
beginning. This was simply a taste of the thunder and nightmare that 
Urien would bring unto the world and its pathetic populous. But Makoto 
wasn&#39;t quite down for the count yet. She pressed her hands into her 
courtyard and pushed herself upwards. Soon she was up on those large 
feet of hers, ready to resume the fight. Urien figured that this was 
probably the time to put her down for good. He crouched down slightly 
and pointed his fist right at the girl. He gripped his poised arm with 
his free hand and gathered lightning energy into it. A process that was 
manifest with results when streaks of electricity began coursing up and 
down his arm. Urien&#39;s arm then jerked backwards with the shooting force 
of a new attack. 

&quot;Kill!&quot;

A large cluster of electrical energy, beaming colours of red and grey 
soon zoomed towards Makoto from the fist of Urien&#39;s arm. It shot at her 
swiftly. By the time she mounted a defence against it, it was already 
hitting her. She screamed out as her body was bombarded with lightning 
energy, which faded a few seconds later. But not without leaving its 
mark. Makoto breathed out faintly and then collapsed to her knees; her 
eyes slipping shut. Urien took this as his sign of victory. The brutal 
demi-god punched the ground violently, making it tremble. Up from the 
ground surged the relentless force of his aura, unleashed as a towering 
pillar of flame and energy. It surrounded him and his body became a 
haunting silhouette inside the rising stream of power. And from that 
stream came his earth-shattering laugh;

&quot;Aha, ha, ha, ha!&quot;

But while Urien celebrated his victory, there was a person nearby who 
wasn&#39;t so sure of it. A speedy kunai was thrown at Urien&#39;s pillar of 
energy. The thin knife was bounced off the column of power effortlessly. 
But it was successful in catching Urien&#39;s attention. The rising wall of 
spirit fire soon ended. And Urien turned around to see who had thrown 
that weapon. It was Ibuki; perched up on the rooftop of the Rindoukan 
Dojo. Just as she had been this morning. Now that she was fully dressed 
in her shinobi clothing; she flipped forwards, across the courtyard, 
landing next to Makoto.

&quot;Hey, Makoto!&quot; She said, pulling her unlikely friend up from the ground, 
&quot;Are you okay?!&quot;

She was dazed, but not out. The woman of the Rindoukan Dojo groaned 
again, shaking her head to nullify the electrifying effects of the 
Metallic Sphere attack. &quot;...Ibuki... you... should go... this man... 
isn&#39;t... normal...&quot;

Ibuki winked at her, playfully. &quot;Hey, neither am I.&quot;

The ninja-in-training then stood right up and faced off with the 
towering Urien. She knew his face. He was a member of the secretive 
organization that her Clan was so set against. Though she had no idea of 
what his strength was... she knew that it paled in comparison to the 
leader of their flock. The master of a growing cult but known only to 
the common few as Gill. If not for the data file that she was forced to 
steal from them; Ibuki would have never known who either of them were. 
But that didn&#39;t matter now. She had to help out Makoto and get this guy 
out of the Rindoukan Dojo. Ibuki then rushed forwards to attack. Makoto 
had more than a few misgivings about that strategy. But Ibuki was in the 
dark about them. Once she came close enough, she kicked straight at 
Urien&#39;s head. The taller man darted his head to one side of the blow and 
turned to face her.

&quot;So!&quot; He commented, &quot;An additional one, eh?!&quot;

Ibuki stopped herself and swerved around to face Urien. &quot;...I&#39;m not one 
to fight people for no need, but you are REALLY asking for this!&quot;

The kunoichi came at Urien again. She forced her elbow out at him with 
the stride. Urien soon blocked the blow. Ibuki withdrew her elbow and 
kicked back at him. The demi-god then veered to one side of that kick to 
avoid it. And just as Ibuki was about to make a third attempt at a hit, 
Urien gave his immediate reprisal. There was no flash or flair. His 
titanic hand simply lunged forwards and grabbed Ibuki by her neck. Ibuki 
struggled violently to get free but it was no use. And her dark eyes 
widened urgently when she felt herself being hoisted from the ground. 
Ibuki&#39;s feet kicked and dangled in the air. Urien held her up there with 
only one of his hands. And the grip he had around her neck grew tighter 
and tighter. 

Urien sneered at her, just as he did Makoto. &quot;Insect! What hope could 
you actually have against a higher being of divinity like myself? 
Insolent pestilence like yourself shall be the first to be swept away 
once my new order comes. So consider yourself lucky to be devastated by 
my hallowed fists!&quot;

Ibuki soon began choking once the grip&#39;s tightness increased even 
further. But Urien&#39;s attention on choking Ibuki made him unaware of the 
activities of Makoto. A powerful war cry proceeded to rend the air. And 
Urien looked up with actual surprise as Makoto, with all her might, 
kicked him right across the face from above. The brother of Gill stepped 
back and his hold on Ibuki lessened. The ninja woman saw this has her 
chance to get free and delivered a kick of her own to the stunned Urien. 
It was enough to break her free. His hand released her out of reflex and 
Ibuki dropped to the ground, coughing. But it had made one thing known. 
Urien was more than powerful enough to take out either of them 
individually. But together, he wouldn&#39;t find it so easy. Ibuki and 
Makoto nodded to each other to confirm it. And in that knowledge, they 
charged at Urien. The titan of terror scowled at the two of them. Makoto 
came at him from the right with a punch. He blocked it. But the second 
he did, Ibuki kicked at him in the stomach. And this tag-team action 
would be repeated again and again. Before they had the satisfaction of 
that, he jumped backwards to put some space between himself and the two 
girls. Once he landed at the back of the courtyard, he stood up. He was 
going to finish them off here and now. Power began running through his 
veins with intense new speed. All of his strength flooding to the 
surface for his new attack. He performed an ancient gesture with both of 
his arms and pressed both hands outward as he completed it, yelling 
magnificently;

&quot;Aegis Reflector!&quot;

A thin but awesomely powerful pane of pink-lavender energy was cast out 
from Urien. One that moved slowly but with a certain path. Ibuki and 
Makoto didn&#39;t know what he intended to do with it. But the twin glint in 
their eyes showed that they had a plan of their own. Ibuki nodded her 
head over to Makoto. She took that as a sign of movement and did so. 
Makoto dashed at Urien to attack him. Meanwhile; Ibuki jumped to the 
outer wall of the Rindoukan Dojo and began running across it, defying 
both gravity and normal human ability. This was a path that sent her 
towards Urien. The demi-god himself saw Makoto&#39;s attack first. She 
attempted to shoot a punch into his stomach. Urien flicked her fist out 
of the way and pelted her across the face. Knocking her closer to the 
encroaching Aegis Reflector. Just like Urien had planned. But in that 
instant of mental occupation, Urien did not see little Ibuki, jumping 
from the wall towards him. His perception of her came just a bit too 
late. And Ibuki had a skill of her own that she was going to try out. 
One of her fists grabbed him by the shoulder. The other one was glowing 
brightly with sky blue energies. In that close range, Ibuki released all 
of the power her body could muster, causing a compact explosion of force 
around the two of them. Even mighty Urien was caught off guard by the 
strength of a close range Yoroi Doushi. His towering torso was thrown 
backwards. Leaving him open for one last blow from Makoto. The tomboy 
teen pulled back her fist and harvested all her strength for it. Once 
her momentum reached a peak, Makoto rushed forwards with her 
outstretched fist so swiftly that Urien was unable to defend against it. 
The older fighter was nailed in the stomach and blown back even further. 
Which, unfortunately for Urien, knocked him deftly into the crystalline 
lilac form of his own attack, the Aegis Reflector. Makoto and Ibuki 
covered their faces from the brilliant light that was discharged when 
Urien&#39;s form smashed through the moving wall of spirit power. Enough to 
do some real damage to him. Urien toppled over and fell to the ground, 
the shards of his attack falling softly upon his muscles. 

Makoto and Ibuki took deep breaths, waiting for Urien&#39;s reprisal. But 
the demonic/seraphic  man looked over at them with a terrifying grimace. 
One that clearly showed his enormous levels of rage. But also showing 
the realization of being outnumbered. He could defeat them easily on 
their own. But when they worked together, there was too much to account 
for at any one given time. Urien stood up, weakened but still strong, 
and stepped backwards.

&quot;This isn&#39;t over!&quot; He roared, &quot;Those who defy my will are those who dig 
their own graves! This isn&#39;t over!&quot;

The mighty higher being then leapt away and jumped straight over the 
right wall that was surrounding the Dojo to make his escape. Urien was 
gone. Makoto and Ibuki both collapsed to the ground to regain their 
strength. 

Ibuki wiped the sweat from her face and breathed out. &quot;...Whoo! Not the 
most pleasant way to spend the evening...!&quot;
