&quot;Hold still, Makoto!&quot;

The tomboy of the Rindoukan Dojo squirmed. Both with embarrassment and 
of pain. Urien was gone. Who knew how long he would be gone for, but 
Makoto hoped never to have to see that maniac again or have to hear him 
babble on with his messianic delusions. But with that battle came what 
followed. The patch-up session. Fortunately Ibuki was more than familiar 
with all the ninja healing arts that her Clan taught its followers. 
After crushing a few rare leaves and mixing them with some distinct 
liquids, she made a balm that could heal most bruises in less than a 
day. Unfortunately, Makoto needed this balm in areas that were slightly 
uncomfortable. Even though Ibuki was the only one between the two of 
them that knew just how to apply the balm. Makoto had to pull down her 
Gi from the shoulders and let Ibuki massage the balm into the areas at 
her ribs, her stomach and beneath her breasts. It was more than awkward, 
and while Makoto couldn&#39;t stop blushing, Ibuki couldn&#39;t stop giggling at 
how squirmy Makoto could be. 

Ibuki pulled her damp and back and smirked. &quot;There. That should do it.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Makoto pulled her Gi back up, swiftly, &quot;...I don&#39;t know why I 
let you stay here. You&#39;re nothing but trouble, Ibuki.&quot;  

The ninja girl leaned back on the training floor. &quot;Hey! It&#39;s not my 
fault that maniac came here! I wasn&#39;t even all that sure about who he 
was! But still... I bet you haven&#39;t had that much fun in a while, huh?&quot;

Makoto snorted. &quot;Fun?! ...Well... I suppose it was kind of... exciting 
for a moment there.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Ibuki put forth, &quot;I always wanted to be... normal. But if 
there&#39;s one thing I like about being a ninja martial artist, it&#39;s the 
thrill I get from fighting strong opponents. There is nothing like it. 
And there are so many fighters out there to meet with.&quot;

That had Makoto curious. &quot;Really?&quot;

Ibuki nodded with honesty. &quot;Of course. My village is a great place for a 
challenge. But the best challenges always come when you go out into the 
world to look for them. I remember that I was in a residential area one 
day, and I got into a fight with a certain someone. I can&#39;t remember his 
name, but he was a French guy with a bad attitude towards street 
fighters. And though he didn&#39;t like street fighting, he had some amazing 
techniques. The fact of the matter is, meeting people is the best way to 
experience the things that life has to offer. That&#39;s what my elders 
taught me. And I believe it.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; Makoto looked around the Dojo. It was her home. Her place of 
training. But if she ever wanted to restore the reputation of it (and 
experience a more exciting life in the process) she had to get out there 
and make her mark on the world. &quot;...I know what I have to do...&quot;

Ibuki blinked. &quot;...Huh? What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;You said that once you finish your fight with me you&#39;re going back to 
Kyoto, right?&quot;

&quot;Well yeah. But what&#39;s that got to do with anything?&quot; The ninja girl 
nodded. 

Makoto looked off into the distance with a confident, restored smile. &quot;I 
bet I could find all new challenges if I went with you.&quot;

And Ibuki smiled back at her with some cheer. It looked like she wasn&#39;t 
going to be alone in her travels anymore. A new page was turning. But 
what would happen next?

That, it seems, would be for the future to decide. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Woke up this morning
The light came in just with the rain
Thunder in the distance
We counted how far away

Watched the people
Acted like we knew what they were up to
They could never have as much fun 
As we do together

Today was the best day
I realized what I wanted to say
Come what may, I&#39;ll be there for you
For you

Stayed up till sunrise
No big surprise - it&#39;s a marathon
I might be gone soon
But please believe

I hold you up to the highest degree

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* Ah. My second Street Fighter fic outside of the EX Series. It came out 
just the way I hoped for it. I&#39;ve been wanting to write a fiction about 
Makoto for the longest time, I&#39;m glad I finally got it done. I think it 
came off a hell of a lot better than that Sakura/Karin thing I tried a 
year or so back. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll make a multi-chapter story out of 
what I have here, but I know that I&#39;ll be writing more about Makoto in 
the future.

* I can&#39;t really tell if Urien was underpowered, overpowered, or just 
right in this story. He happens to be one of my favourite Street Fighter 
3 characters so I hope I did him justice. 

* The Narumi/Elena was fairly conclusive, but I&#39;d like to think that the 
Makoto/Ibuki pairing was more open ended. It saves room for additional 
work. 

* I think it should be obvious by now, but I took a few liberties with 
the canon. I&#39;ve heard somewhere that Elena was a princess. I don&#39;t know 
if that&#39;s true or not, but I just ignored that factor for the time 
being. And I also heard that Elena studied in Japan for a while (which 
is how she met Narumi) but again I ignored this until I can be sure of 
it. After researching the EX series a month or so back, I can safely say 
that notions like these are more often fan-canon than they are official.
