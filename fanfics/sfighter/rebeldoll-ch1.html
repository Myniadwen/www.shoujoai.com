<h1>Rebellion of the Dolls</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sfighter/index.html">Street Fighter</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/deathscythe.html">DeathscytheH1213</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Note: This is an Action/Romance/Lemon. This is my first fic so go easy 
on me ok Flames and Compliments are accepted even if its U SUCK or 
THIS IS THE GREATEST FIC EVER. With all that said and done on with the 
fic. 


&quot;Next Mission Commencing&quot; the monotonous voice rang in the back Cammy 
White&#39;s mind, as her eyes quickly shot open. That was all there was in 
her life at Shadowlaw. The next mission. She was a trained assassin by 
Shadowlaw brought up to be a cold-blooded killer. She knew nothing 
else, nothing of her past and not what the future had in store for 
her. Only the next mission or objective to carry out. 

Her body had been toned to perfection from the years of training, 
pain, and enhancing experiments she had endured. Her appearance did 
not give the impression that she was an accomplished fighter, but her 
opponents soon found out on the battlefield that she was not to be 
underestimated.

Cammy quickly awoke and dressed herself in her usual fighting garb. 
That being her light blue leotard and peculiar yellow tie. The whole 
time keeping an emotionless mask on her face. When she finished she 
left her room only to be greeted by one of Bison&#39;s dolls, more 
specifically the enhanced clone Juni. The blonde girl faced Cammy with 
much the same expression as Cammy&#39;s. Neither girl said a word for 5 
minutes until Juni finally stated, &quot;Operative No. 4 Cammy White you 
are to report to the training grounds and sparr with Operative No. 5 
Juli and I. Are your orders clear.&quot; &quot;Understood&quot; Cammy replied in much 
the same tone of voice as the doll that stood facing her. Though Cammy 
was a bit surprised to hear so many words in one sentence by the doll. 
&quot;May I ask what the purpose of us sparring today is?&quot; Cammy asked. 
&quot;Lord Bison wishes to observe and see how your abilities have 
developed.&quot; &quot;Understood&quot; Cammy said. &quot;What is the ETA?&quot; &quot;We commence 
operations effective 14:00 hours.&quot; 

To say that Cammy was curious would be a great understatement. &#39;Why 
must he do this? I have proven myself many times&#39;. &#39;Damn you Bison one 
day I will end your life and gain my freedom.&#39; Cammy thought.  

Several hours past and Cammy reported to the training facility deep in 
Shadowlaw after attending to some other insignificant duties. When she 
arrived in the room the first person she saw was none other than the 
criminal mastermind himself M.Bison. She hated this man no this 
monster that had brought so much pain into her life both mentally and 
physically. The only reason she was here was because of Bison&#39;s 
dreaded Psycho Drive. The drive had tied her to him so tightly that 
she followed his orders without question, but she still could think on 
her own she was not the mindless puppet that she once was. She could 
now make decisions of her own. Unfortunately she could never get rid 
of the attitude her long years of servitude to Bison left on her ,but 
she would try to get what little of her life was left back. She hated 
what he had done to her and one day she vowed that the torment would 
end.

She stole a glance at the monster on the other end of the room. She 
hated how he looked at her. She despised how he looked at her with 
those cold, white, pupiless eyes of his. She would always remember 
them until the day she died. They were drilled into her mind like a 
screw into a piece of wood. She was forever tied to him but there 
would be a day when that tie would be broken by his death and 
preferably dealt by her hand.

She also noticed the dolls in the room. Bison finally acknowledged her 
presence after a moment. &quot;Welcome Killer Bee I&#39;m glad you could join 
us.&quot; Cammy did not reply she merely walked to the center of the room 
as if not even hearing his words. She stopped when she reached the 
center of the room then turned to stare in the eyes of Juni and Juli. 
Their glares seemed as cold as his but she knew better she knew that 
they had been brainwashed into being his dolls. They had undergone the 
same treatments as her, and in them she saw what she once was. This 
was another thing she hated about him he felt the need to make all of 
his employees as emotionless as he was. &#39;I&#39;ll free them Bison one day 
when you least expect it I will.&#39; Cammy thought as she stared into the 
cold eyes of the dolls. She was just like them at one time always 
bending to his will without question.  Never aware of what she was 
doing. Bison again spoke after what seemed like years consequently 
breaking her internal thought. &quot; I&#39;m sure you have been informed as to 
why you are here Cammy.&quot; &quot;Yes Sir&quot; was her only reply. &quot;You are to 
test your abilities against both Juni and Juli, at the same time.&quot; 
&quot;Sir?&quot; Cammy asked she had never fought both of them at the same time. 
She knew how deadly they were alone, but together they were outright 
invincible. &quot; Yes Cammy I want to see if you are still worth keeping 
around heh heh heh &quot; he said coldly.  Cammy knew what this meant. It 
wasn&#39;t just a sparring match it was to determine if she was still 
useful. &quot; Understood &quot; Cammy said as she sank into her usual fighting 
stance bouncing on the balls of her feet. The dolls each took on 
similar stances. &quot; Target Confirmed&quot; Juli said. &quot;Commencing attack 
mode 095&quot; Juni mechanically replied. The match began quickly. The 
dolls both started by Juni shooting off into her Spiral Arrow and Juli 
into her Sniping Arrow both with their legs flaming with psycho power. 
Cammy barely had time to dodge as the dolls screamed toward her, but 
she managed to side step out of the way as they blew by her. &quot;CANNON 
SPIKE&quot; Cammy screamed as she managed to clip Juli&#39;s sholder as she 
flew by her. If Juli felt any pain from the blow she didn&#39;t show it as 
she rolled with blow in the process grabbing Cammy&#39;s outstretched 
ankle and preceding to imbed her into the floor. Cammy anticipated 
this and twisted in midair and out of Juli&#39;s grip. After land she and 
the dolls faced off again. The dolls again made the first move and 
began attacking her with blazingly fast punches and kicks each 
perfectly timed with the others. Only Cammy&#39;s superior speed kept her 
alive at the moment, but she didn&#39;t know how long she could hold out.&#39; 
They are relentless in their attacks both of their moves are in 
perfect sync with each other.&#39; Cammy thought as the dolls onslaught 
continued. Cammy realized she had to gain distance between the two 
dolls so that she could make a plan of attack. So she quickly escaped 
the dolls relentless onslaught back flipping to the other end of the 
room to distancing herself and preparing to go on the offensive. 

&#39;Attack No. 4 commencing&#39; Cammy&#39;s enhanced mind thought, as she sank 
into her position and launched herself into the air yelling, &quot;GO&quot; in 
the process. As she soared she rolled into a ball and began to spin. 
Juni and Juli were not unprepared for this move but made an attempt to 
dodge it just the same, &quot;Switching to mode 070. Conserving vitality.&quot;  
Juli being the slower of the two clones was caught by a sailing Cammy. 
As Cammy&#39;s legs wrapped around Juli&#39;s head she began to shift her 
weight backwards into one of her infamous frankensteiner moves. Juli&#39;s 
head was abruptly brought to the ground and causing blackness to 
surround Juli&#39;s vision. &#39;Damage range exceeded forced shut down 
employed&#39; Juli&#39;s mind echoed as she fell into unconsciousness. Cammy 
immediately regained her footing only to be greeted by Juni&#39;s attack. 
Cammy was immediately caught off guard. The battle was now marginally 
easier because of Juli&#39;s temporary incapacitation. Juni began with a 
swift knee to the stomach Cammy countered this by imbedding both her 
hands into the blow thus stopping its momentum and enable ling her to 
lift off the ground retaliate with a snap kick to the temple of the 
doll. Juni responded y blocking the vicious blow with both of her 
forearms stopping the blow dead in its tracks and leaving Cammy wide 
open. &#39;Damn&#39; Cammy thought as she received a painful blow to her 
shoulder as a result of Juni&#39;s own snap kick. Cammy proceeded to shift 
with the blow&#39;s momentum. As she did this Cammy saw an opening and 
delivered a fierce punch to Juni&#39;s abdomen apparently the opening was 
just a trick. &#39;Subject has submitted to simulation No. 8&#39; Juni&#39;s mind 
stated in its machine-like tone&#39;. Juni caught Cammy&#39;s arm and 
proceeded to dislocate it. Juni quickly accomplished this and received 
a sharp gasp from Cammy before she was thrown across the room. Cammy 
slowly regained her footing obviously in severe pain due to the fact 
that she was holding her arm. She stood for moment staring at the doll 
with tried eyes &#39;No not yet I can&#39;t lose now&#39; with this thought Cammy 
launched herself at the doll &quot;Cannon Drill&quot; she yelled as she curled 
into the special move. Unfortunately the move never made contact as 
Juli&#39;s Sniping Arrow intercepted her. As a result Cammy was sent 
sprawling to the cold floor of concrete. Cammy slowly stood up though 
now it was on shaky legs and her vision was now starting to blur and 
darken. &quot;Target vitality now 77%. Proceeding with attack simulation 
No. 37 &quot; Juni stated. &quot;Proceeding with target extermination.&quot; Juli 
said having regained consciousness. As Cammy regained her footing she 
whatched as the dolls both shared the same expression. The emotionless 
stare was not there instead a look of sympathy graced the faces of 
both the dolls but it only lasted for a second then disappeared. 
Thankfully Bison had not noticed this fact yet so the fight continued. 
Both servants. Finally Juni and Juli stopped their joined attack and 
jump to the other side of the room. Bison suddenly stood up apparently 
not very happy. &quot;Finish it now&quot; he said both dolls launched themselves 
forward at full force both charging and performing their patented dual 
move the Shadowlaw Servitude both pummeling Cammy with dual fists and 
feet until both ending with a Sniping Arrow. Cammy flew back and hit 
the nearby wall and slumped to the ground. &#39;I can&#39;t give up I&#133;I can&#39;t 
fail them now&#39; &quot; I&#39;ll free you both I promise.&quot; With that said Cammy 
slowly rose to her feet shaking and shivering on the way. When she 
looked up to face the dolls she was faced with the same expressions as 
before, then back to cold like stone.  Suddenly Juni and Juli step 
forward and quickly raised their hands in a salute both yelling&quot;Yes 
Sir!&quot; Cammy knew all too well what was coming. She turned to see Bison 
staring at her with a sneer then disappearing into thin air then 
reappearing in front of both his servants. Still wearing the sneer. He 
then launched himself into his feared Psycho Crusher.&#39; I won&#39;t give up 
not yet!&#39;Cammy&#39;s mind screamed. She knew she only had one chance. She 
crouched into position and waited. As Bison screamed toward her still 
the smirk plastered to his face. &#39;Now&#39; Cammy&#39;s mind whispered. &quot;Come 
On!&quot; Cammy screamed. She began to tilt her body backwards until her 
hands touched the ground all the while she began to spin. Finally she 
pushed off the ground spinning like tornado. Her move was perfectly 
timed and it caught Bison in the chin. Her feet burned with the flames 
of psycho power. &#39;How ironic to be beaten by what used to be another 
one of your dolls&#39; Cammy thought. She continued to imbed her feet into 
Bison&#39;s chin. Finally Bison fell to the ground in a heap along with an 
exhausted Cammy White. She had won at least that&#39;s what she thought 
Bison quickly appeared behind her using his teleport maneuver and 
proceeded to deliver her from consciousness with a quick psycho 
powered cop to the neck. Cammy&#39;s world went black; as the blow was 
delivered &#39;No&#39; her mind echoed as conscious thought left her leaving 
only blackness.
