<h1>The Star Who Shines in Me (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kaleido/index.html">Kaleido Star</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cyberano.html">Cyberano</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kaleido/starshine-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Layla sat on the couch and watched Sora&#39;s and Rosetta&#39;s recorded 
performance.  It was remarkable how the young Diablos genius had come so 
far.  She watched as Sora reached out for Rosetta, and Rosetta took hold 
of Sora&#39;s hand as a princess who had just found her long lost prince.  
&quot;Princess?  What?&quot;  Layla took the remote and rewound the scene.  She 
watched it again and was touched by the tenderness of Rosetta&#39;s 
performance.  It was like watching a pair of lovers trying to make up 
for lost time.  

Layla bit her lower lip.  She felt envious.  It should be her and Sora 
in that scene.  To reach for Sora, to take her in her arms, to look in 
her eyes as they spun towards the climax.  It should have been her.  
Layla gingerly touched the bandages on her right shoulder.  The surgery 
was a success and she was grateful that science was now able to repair 
her shoulder.  Now, all that was needed was time.  &quot;I will make up for 
lost time.  For sure.  For sure.&quot;  Layla said out loud.

The door bell rang.  Layla heard her maid scurry to answer it.  Layla 
watched the performance a bit more and then turned it off.  Layla 
thought, &quot;If I keep watching it, it only makes me want ...&quot;

&quot;Miss, you have a guest.&quot;  announced the maid.  A pair of footsteps 
echoed through the hallway.

Layla turned to greet the guest.  Her eyes widened in recognition.

&quot;...Sora...&quot; Her name slowly rolled over her tongue in an astonished 
whisper.

&quot;Layla-san...&quot;  Layla&#39;s name caught in her throat.  She hadn&#39;t seen 
Layla for over 2 years.  To see Layla before her shook her very being 
and she reveled in the joy of her presence. 

The silence between them was deafening.  

&quot;Umm...&quot; 

&quot;So...&quot;

Both paused to let the other finish.  Then Sora smiled and giggled.  
Infected by Sora&#39;s giggle, Layla giggled as well.

&quot;You look great, Layla-san.&quot;

&quot;And you as well.&quot;  Layla walked closer to Sora until they were just 
under a foot apart.  &quot;It seems that you&#39;ve gotten taller as well.&quot;  
Layla glanced down.  &quot;And filled out a bit more...&quot; she thought and was 
pleased that Sora had grown well in many ways.  &quot;Come have a seat.&quot;  
Layla gestured to the couch.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Sora seated herself on one side of the couch.

Layla walked over and seated herself right next to Sora.  &quot;So what 
brings you here?&quot;

&quot;when I heard from Kate that you were coming home to recuperate, so I 
wanted to be the first to welcome you back.&quot;  Sora fumbled with her 
fingers nervously.  She didn&#39;t expect Layla to sit next to her.  She 
glanced over at Layla&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;How&#39;s your shoulder?&quot;

&quot;It is doing quite well.  In a week or two, I should be able to do 
without the sling.&quot;  said Layla proudly.

&quot;That&#39;s great!  And when it&#39;s all healed, will you... will you go back 
to the stage?&quot; 

&quot;Of course!  That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.&quot;  beamed Layla.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait Layla-san!&quot;  exclaimed Sora.  &quot;Kaleido Stage will be even 
better when you come back!&quot;

&quot;Wonderful!&quot;  said Fool who clapped his hands at the prospect of Layla 
returning to the stage.

&quot;Oh?  Fool is still here?&quot;  asked Layla in wonderment.  

&quot;Er... yeah... Fool, stop following me around!&quot;  scolded Sora.  And then 
she realized something.  She turned to Layla.  &quot;You can still see Fool?&quot;

&quot;Whenever you&#39;re around, he shows up here and there.  Sometimes I see 
him behind a door.&quot;  replied Layla.

Sora hoped that Fool didn&#39;t get any chance to peep at Layla.  She 
decided to scold him more when she got home.  Meanwhile, Fool had laid 
out his cards as usual.  &quot;Don&#39;t bother, Fool.&quot;  chided Sora.  &quot;You 
usually predict bad stuff anyway.  I&#39;d rather not hear it.&quot;

But Fool had picked a card and held it up in front of him.  His eyes 
widened and his jaw dropped visibly.  &quot;I think my deck needs more 
shuffling...&quot;  said Fool.  He was about to return the card when Layla 
plucked it from his hand.  &quot;No... wait... &quot; protested Fool and tried to 
take the card back before Layla saw it.  

But Layla saw the card before Fool grabbed it back.  What she saw made 
her heart flutter.  She wasn&#39;t sure what it meant, and she began to 
imagine the possibilities.

Fool floated a bit further away and shuffled his deck.  He spread it out 
and picked.  His smile faded as he read the card, and read it again.  

Sora watched Fool&#39;s reaction and the subsequent dumbfounded look.  She 
leaned forward and rested her head between her hands.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong, 
Fool?  Is it the same card?&quot; asked Sora.   

&quot;How... how... did you know?!&quot; exclaimed Fool with a surprised gesture.

Sora straightened up and threw her hands up.  &quot;I just guessed.  You do 
so much fortune telling, so I can sometimes tell what you&#39;re thinking.&quot;  
explained Sora.  &quot;Even if half of what you&#39;re thinking is some utterly 
perverted thing...&quot;  thought Sora inwardly.  &quot;So what is it?&quot;  Sora 
leaned forward and reached for the card.  

&quot;Nothing... nothing you should worry about... &quot;  Fool shielded the card 
and floated further away.  He made a hasty bow.  &quot;Allow me to give you 
both some time alone.&quot;  And with that, Fool floated up and away.

&quot;Hey!&quot;  Sora grabbed empty air in vain.  She stood puzzled over Fool&#39;s 
behavior.  &quot;Sheesh... why didn&#39;t he tell me?  He always tells me...&quot;  
thought Sora.

Layla clenched her fist on her lap.  The card troubled her.  &quot;I need to 
know... no... I must know!&quot;  thought Layla inwardly.  She mustered up 
her determination.  &quot;Sora...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Do you have some time?&quot;

Sora nodded.  &quot;I have the rest of the day off and the week as well.  
Kaleido stage is on break.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;  beamed Layla.  She grabbed Sora&#39;s hand.  &quot;Come with me, 
then.&quot;  She lead Sora out of the living room.

&quot;Ummm... &quot;  Sora followed Layla with curiosity.  &quot;Where are we going, 
Layla-san?&quot;  Sora followed Layla through a couple of hallways.  Layla 
pushed on a set of double doors and they entered a large room with a 
high ceiling.  &quot;Oh, I remember now!  This is your practice room!&quot;  Sora 
was impressed that Layla had her own practice room.  

Layla opened a nearby drawer and took out a shoulder and arm brace.  She 
took off the sling and started to put it on.

&quot;Are you... going to practice?!&quot;  Sora was alarmed because of Layla&#39;s 
healing shoulder. &quot;But ... your shoulder!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot;  said Layla.  &quot;I&#39;ve done it a couple times already.  The 
brace prevents my shoulder from moving, so it&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;But... isn&#39;t that a little reckless?&quot;

Layla stopped adjusting the brace and blinked a couple times.  &quot;I&#39;m 
surprised to hear that from you, O most reckless of all.&quot;  Layla said 
jokingly.

&quot;What?  Me?&quot;  Sora pointed to herself.

&quot;Yes, you.  Or do I have to recount every instance where I had to catch 
you when you fell?&quot;

&quot;Oh.  OH!&quot;  Sora rubbed the back of her head nervously and laughed her 
embarrassment away.  &quot;Er, did you need help?&quot;  

&quot;Sure... can you tighten these straps?&quot;

After Layla adjusted the brace, they mounted opposite platforms and 
faced each other.  Layla unhooked a loop of rope and slipped it over one 
ankle.  Sora quickly understood and did the same.  &quot;Are you ready?&quot;  
Layla&#39;s voice echoed an invitation across the room.  

Sora nodded.  &quot;Yes!&quot;  She swung herself from the platform as Layla 
launched from hers.  She met Layla at the middle and clasped her left 
hand with Layla&#39;s.  Although Layla&#39;s right arm was bound, her 
performance did not diminish.  For this, Sora&#39;s heart soared with relief 
and she sought to complement each graceful pose, each gentle gesture and 
each elegant movement.  A feeling of peace filled her heart and she 
almost cried with happiness.  &quot;This... I missed this so much, 
Layla-san...&quot;  she thought.  &quot;I missed you so much...&quot;  Sora&#39;s mouth 
formed soundless words.

Layla reveled with the joy of soaring through the air with Sora.  Her 
body seemed to move on its own and wove complicated maneuvers in tandem 
with Sora.  When she got a chance to, she locked eyes with Sora, and 
hoped that she felt the same.  She was not disappointed and her heart 
soared even more.  &quot;Of all the stages that I have been on, the one that 
excites me the most is...&quot;

Suddenly, the door opened.  The maid came in and bowed.  &quot;I&#39;m very 
sorry, but another guest has come to see you.&quot;

Layla looked over at Sora and Sora nodded in understanding.  They pushed 
against each other using their palms and swung back to the other side.  
Layla turned to Sora.  &quot;Sora, we&#39;ll have to continue this some other 
time.&quot;  

&quot;Anytime you want, Layla-san.  Just let me know.&quot;  replied Sora.  She 
descended the platform and helped Layla out of the brace.  They went out 
to meet the new guest.

Cathy lounged comfortably in Layla&#39;s lazyboy.  Judging by the snacks and 
dishes on the coffee table, Layla had another guest.  She helped herself 
to the last piece of pie as she waited patiently for Layla.  Finally, 
Layla emerged from the doorway followed by Sora.  Cathy arched her left 
eyebrow.  She didn&#39;t expect the other guest to be Sora.  Judging by 
their flushed appearance, she guessed what they had been doing and 
sighed inwardly.  Instinctively, she realized what Layla&#39;s answer would 
be to her proposal.  But she had to at least try.  Smiling she got up 
and extended her left hand to greet Layla.  &quot;Layla!  You look great.  It 
looks like the surgery went well, huh?&quot;

Layla shook Cathy&#39;s hand.  &quot;It&#39;s good to see you.  How&#39;s the show?&quot;  

&quot;Pretty good.  So good in fact, the sponsor wants to do one of my other 
plays and will back the entire production.&quot;

&quot;Oh, which one?&quot;

&quot;Revolutionary Girl Lillia.&quot;

Layla grinned widely.  &quot;Good one!&quot;  She sat down on the couch and picked 
up a glass of water.  &quot;So who&#39;s the lead?&quot;  She tipped the glass to 
drink.

Cathy plopped down unto the lazyboy.  &quot;Why, YOU of course.&quot;

Layla fought not to spurt.  &quot;Wha--at?  Why me?  I certainly don&#39;t fit 
the tomboy type.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just how she dresses.  What&#39;s more important is her character - 
strong willed, brave and noble.  That fits you quite well.&quot;  

Layla laughed.  &quot;You should know flattery won&#39;t get you anywhere.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s true!&quot;  Cathy turned to Sora and gave her a wink.  &quot;Don&#39;t you 
think so, Sora?&quot;  

&quot;Well... Layla-san did a few male roles in past performances, so I&#39;m 
sure she can do it.&quot;

&quot;Not quite the answer I expected, but...&quot;  thought Cathy.  &quot;See?  Even 
Sora says so.&quot;  Cathy glanced quickly over to Sora.  &quot;She looks a bit 
troubled.&quot;  Cathy noted to herself.

&quot;I&#39;m really honored that you asked me first, but I&#39;m sorry, Cathy.  I 
have to decline.&quot;  Layla said firmly.

Cathy watched Sora at the edge of her vision.  Sora seemed to look 
relieved at Layla&#39;s decision.  She leaned back and sighed.  &quot;Well, if 
you don&#39;t want to, I suppose I can&#39;t convince you otherwise.  You&#39;re too 
strong-willed.&quot;  she said jokingly.

Layla laughed softly.  &quot;You should know that best.&quot;

Cathy put the script on the coffee table.  &quot;Here&#39;s a copy of the script.  
If you change your mind, let me know.  And, if you don&#39;t mind, let me 
ask you one more thing.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Can I have another piece of pie?&quot;

&quot;Of course, help yourself.&quot;

&quot;Thanks!  Here, let me carry some dishes back.&quot;  Cathy began to gather 
the empty dishes and glasses.

&quot;Wait, let me call the maid...&quot;  as soon as she said it, the doorbell 
rang.

&quot;Looks like she&#39;ll be busy.  Don&#39;t worry, I know my way.&quot;

&quot;More like your stomach knows the way.&quot; said Layla jokingly.

&quot;Heh... that too.&quot;

&quot;Umm... let me help too!&quot;  Sora gathered the other dishes and 
silverware.  She wanted Layla to have some time for her new guest, so 
she jumped at the chance to leave the room.  

Layla watched as Cathy and Sora left the room.  She had to admit, the 
play tempted her.  But she had made up her mind when she performed with 
Sora earlier.  She picked up her pie and nibbled a bit while waiting for 
her next guest.  Finally, the maid opened the door.

&quot;Hello, Layla.  It&#39;s been a while.&quot;

&quot;Yuuri!  How are you?  How was Paris?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.  And you look as good as ever.&quot;  replied Yuuri.  He told her 
about the time he spent in Paris.  In exchange, Layla recounted her 
shows in Broadway.

Meanwhile, Cathy and Sora cleaned up the dishes and prepared more pie 
and drinks.  They were walking back to the living room when they 
overhead Yuuri.

&quot;I love you, Layla.  Go out with me!&quot;

Cathy and Sora stopped in their tracks.  They immediately moved and 
stood with their backs against the outside wall of the living room to 
eavesdrop. 

&quot;Oh.  Maybe that&#39;s what it meant...&quot;  Fool floated near the door.

&quot;Fool!&quot;  With lightning speed, Sora grabbed Fool.  &quot;What do you mean, 
Fool?  Tell me!&quot;  Sora tried to keep her voice down as much as she can.

&quot;The... card... *gasp* ... means ... a special person... find ... 
heart... bond ... forever...&quot;  Fool began to turn blue.

&quot;Ok, I&#39;m going to let go, but you better promise to tell me.&quot;  demanded 
Sora.  Fool nodded and Sora freed him from her grasp.

Fool took several gasping breaths.  When he got his wind back, he 
flicked his hand in a grand gesture and produced the card he drew 
before.   He showed it to Sora and explained,  &quot;The Lovers.  To the 
fortune seeker, it means that a special person will find a path to the 
seeker&#39;s heart.  The seeker will shine the brightest with this person 
and will forge a bond that will last forever.  With this bond, the 
seeker and this person become complete.&quot;  Fool paused and looked in 
Layla&#39;s direction.  &quot;I wanted to do a fortune to celebrate Layla&#39;s 
return.  Judging by what&#39;s going right now, it seems that the wheel of 
fortune is turning for Layla.&quot;

Sora&#39;s hand flew to her mouth.  &quot;Are you saying that this card predicts 
that Layla will find her true love?!&quot;  Suddenly, she felt a hand on her 
shoulder.  She looked up to see Cathy&#39;s concerned eyes.

&quot;Are you alright, Sora?&quot;  Cathy was puzzled at Sora&#39;s behavior.  It 
seemed that Sora was grabbing empty air and talking to herself.

&quot;Umm... I... I&#39;m fine... I was... just surprised...&quot;  explained Sora in 
a halting voice.  For some reason, the air seemed unusually and hard to 
breathe.  &quot;I guess... we should give them some time alone?&quot;  She spoke 
the words slowly as if poison barbs were in her throat.

Just then the door bell rang.  &quot;Oh, looks like Layla has more guests.&quot;  
said Cathy.  A phone started ringing in the other room just as the maid 
hurried by.  Yuuri&#39;s voice carried to the hallway as he answered the 
call.  Soon, the door opened, and Yuuri walked out.  He paused when he 
saw Sora and Cathy, and then nodded a quick hello.  He walked away while 
talking on the phone and made his way to the inner courtyard.  Cathy 
turned to Sora.  &quot;well, shall we go in?&quot;  asked Cathy.  Sora nodded and 
they made their way into the living room.  They set down the pie and 
drinks on the table.  After they had done so, the maid ushered in the 
new guests.

&quot;Ken!  Rosetta!&quot;  exclaimed Sora.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;We heard that Layla was in town, so we came by to welcome her back.&quot;  
said Ken.  Ken offered Layla a bouquet of flowers.  &quot;We got these for 
you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Ken how nice.&quot;  replied Layla.  &quot;Cathy, can you help me find 
a vase for these?&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot;  Cathy took the flowers from Ken and left the living room.  

&quot;How long will you be staying, Layla-san.&quot; asked Ken.

&quot;Hopefully, for a while.  When my shoulder heals, you better have the 
stage ready for me.&quot;  said Layla proudly.

&quot;Really!  That would be something!  Right, Rosetta?&quot;  asked Ken.

&quot;The return of Layla Hamilton!  Kaleido Stage will shine even brighter!&quot;  
Rosetta struck a dramatic pose.  They all laughed boisterously at 
Rosetta&#39;s pose.  When they settled down, Rosetta asked &quot;Hey, Layla, I 
heard that you co-starred with Mark Crewford in your last Broadway show.  
Is that true?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  I did.&quot;  replied Layla.  Layla answered their questions about the 
young popular actor.  They were in a midst of a debate when the phone 
rang.  A few moments later, the maid came in.  

&quot;A call for you miss.&quot;  The maid held a cordless phone in her hand.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Layla turned to her guests.  &quot;Excuse me for a moment.&quot;  
Layla exited the room and took the call in the secure AV room to avoid 
eavesdroppers.

Rosetta watched Layla leave.  After a few moments of small talk, she 
touched Ken&#39;s shoulder reassuringly.  &quot;I have to go to the ladies room.  
I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;  Rosetta quickly left the living room.  &quot;Ok, Ken.  
Go for it!&quot;  Rosetta thought and smiled inwardly.  And then she walked 
around to find the ladies room.

Layla paced the AV room.  She glanced at the surveillance monitors to 
see what was going on in the living room.  Her eyes widened as she saw 
Ken take hold of Sora&#39;s hands in what appeared to be a confession.  Her 
hand almost dropped the phone when she saw Ken lean in.  Ashamed of 
eavesdropping, she turned away.  &quot;What am I doing?&quot;  she thought.  And 
then she heard the insistent caller on the phone.  She had to end this 
call.  Now.  &quot;No, thank you.  Please check it again.  Yes.  That will be 
fine.  Goodbye.&quot;  Layla left the AV room and walked down the hallway 
aimlessly.  She remembered the card that Fool had.  She sighed and 
muttered, &quot;I should have expected that... Sora has him...&quot;  

&quot;Has who?&quot;  asked Cathy who walked up behind Layla.  She carried another 
helping of pie in her hand.  When Layla turned toward her, she wasn&#39;t 
prepared for the look of loss on Layla&#39;s face.  &quot;Something&#39;s up... first 
Sora, now Layla... hmm...&quot;  She remembered Sora&#39;s words in the hallway.  
And then she remembered seeing Ken stumble onto Sora when she returned 
to the living room.  It also occurred to her that Layla sometimes takes 
calls in the AV room where all the surveillance cameras in the house 
were located.  As the pieces of the puzzle fell into place, a 
mischievous grin spread across her face.  She took Layla&#39;s arm.  &quot;Let&#39;s 
go this way.&quot;

&quot;But the living room is that way.&quot;  said Layla.

&quot;I know.  Don&#39;t ask.  Just come with me.&quot;  Cathy took out her cell 
phone.  She proceeded to make a call.  Cathy led Layla outside the 
mansion and to her parked car.  Cathy increased the pitch of her voice 
to high school student levels. &quot;Hello, may I speak to Sora please?  It&#39;s 
about the stage.  Yes, I can hold.&quot;

&quot;What are you up to?&quot;  Layla was now concerned that Cathy was going to 
force her to do the play.  

Cathy opened the door to her car.  &quot;Get in, please.&quot;  She talked into 
the cell.  &quot;Sora.  It&#39;s me.  I have something you want.  Please meet me 
outside, by the second gate.  Come soon.  Bye.&quot;

Now Layla was curious.  She decided to go along for now and sat in 
Cathy&#39;s car.  A few moments later, Sora came over.  

Cathy gestured to the car.  &quot;Get in.&quot;

Sora was about to protest, but she saw Layla in the car.  She obediently 
got in as well.  

Cathy got into the driver&#39;s side and started the car.  They drove away 
from the Hamilton mansion.  

&quot;Umm... where are we going?&quot;  asked Sora.

&quot;Patience.  You&#39;ll see.&quot;  said Cathy.

They arrived at the Hamilton&#39;s private dock.  Cathy stopped the car.  
&quot;Well, ladies, here we are.  You can come out now.&quot;

Layla knitted her brows as she and Sora got out of the car.  &quot;Why did 
you bring us here, Cathy?&quot;

With a sweeping gesture, Cathy made the dock her stage, and declaimed:

I saw tribulation did thy tryst thrice beset.
Fate&#39;s hand compelled me to take you away 
So that you may resume your stage today.
Let your humble servant exit with regret
To leave than to watch this story be told.
Your stage is set, let your destiny unfold.

She bowed and Sora and Layla clapped at her performance.  &quot;Well then, 
I&#39;m off.  I&#39;ll take care of the rest of the folks at your place.&quot;  She 
waved farewell and smiled a mischievous grin.  &quot;Have fun, ladies.&quot;
