  <p><em><strong>Bold </strong></em>are thoughts&hellip;<em>Italics </em>are enfaces, other languages, and focused speech</p>
  <p>----------</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I can make it, just a little bit more.&rdquo; </strong></em>The  petite girl passed the point of no return and she let go of the bar.  High in the air on the practice trapeze, Rosetta was airborne. This was  the moment she loved the most. When a person let go on a trapeze this  high up, swinging as fast as she did, they enjoyed a brief few seconds  of weightlessness before they were forced to obey the laws of gravity.  Rosetta couldn&rsquo;t have been happier because it felt like she was flying  and to top it off her target was heading straight for her with perfect  timing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I can do this. I know I can&rdquo; </strong></em></p>
  <p>Rosetta  closed her eyes and her body coiled back like a snake in midair. When  she felt like the moment had arrived, the petite girl sprung forward  and did a three pronged vertical spin that spanned no more than two  seconds. The redhead came out of her spin with only one arm facing out  to catch the bar. A few months ago she wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to grab  the incoming bar but her strength training made this stunt possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did it!&rdquo; called out Rosetta but her victory cry was premature. Just as  the bar came within catching distance&hellip;she missed. The failure was like  a blow to her stomach. <strong><em>&ldquo;Not again.&rdquo; </em></strong>thought the redhead disappointingly as she watched the trapeze bar get farther and farther away.</p>
  <p>The  girl fell down to the safety net and landed with a bounce. After her  body settled into the ropes she looked upwards at the swinging bars and  let out a sigh. &ldquo;Next time for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your call that a devil&rsquo;s spiral?&rdquo; came an irritated voice out of nowhere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I almost had it.&rdquo; replied Rosetta without finding out where the voice came from.</p>
  <p>The  redhead was only met with silence, which suited her just fine as she  stared at the ceiling deep in thought. Her musings was interrupted when  the safety net began moving. The cause eclipsed her view of the ceiling  in the form of black haired Chinese girl with a disappointed look upon  her face.</p>
  <p>May looked down at the redhead and let out a sigh. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you have gone home by now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta  didn&rsquo;t answer, she rolled away from the inquiring girl and jumped down  from the safety net. May followed her movements to the bench where the  redhead grabbed a bottle of water and refreshed herself. &ldquo;I just trying  to perfect the routine you thought me.&rdquo; said the after she finished her  drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you have a long ways to go.&rdquo; May jumped off the net  to talk to Rosetta on the ground floor. &ldquo;One.&rdquo; The girl held up her  index finger. &ldquo;Your release was way too early and two.&rdquo; May pointed up  her second finger. &ldquo;Your movements were not wild enough, and three.&rdquo;  May held up her third finger. &ldquo;Why the hell are you practicing when you  should be out having fun or going home to see your family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta  sat on the bench. &ldquo;For the first one I had to compensate for my lighter  weight than yours, for the second one, my movements were as crazy as it  gets and lastly, where do you get off telling me that when your still  standing here to scold me when you should be having fun or going home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But scolding your is fun and as soon as you get your butt moving I&rsquo;m heading home as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By all means, don&rsquo;t let me keep you.&rdquo; Rosetta said as she headed for the door with a very persistent May close on her heels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t have to be bitchy because I&rsquo;m just trying to look after my  partner.&rdquo; For the first time May had a partner she really connected  with on stage and the girl was getting irritated that Rosetta was  trying to brush off her concern. For the last week the redhead had been  acting depressed and the hours she stayed to practice even amazed May  who was always known to keep a brutal regimen. &ldquo;Would you at least tell  me what&rsquo;s got you so preoccupied?&rdquo; Rosetta still didn&rsquo;t say anything  and May sighed. &ldquo;Why do I bother?&rdquo; said the Chinese girl to herself.</p>
  <p>The  redhead finally stopped and turned around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to be mean  but its just some personal stuff that&rsquo;s got me under the weather and it  doesn&rsquo;t concern you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May was hurt by the comment but she would never admit it. &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you really want to know that bad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ya.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its my mother, she&rsquo;s been cheating on my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  didn&rsquo;t know what to say, her curiosity had her wanting to know but she  didn&rsquo;t really have any idea what she was going to do with that kind of  information. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May meant that sincerely but the  way it came out sounded sarcastic. &ldquo;See, not your problem.&rdquo; said  Rosetta as she turned around and headed for her room.</p>
  <p>The  oriental girl stood there dumbfounded. She was normally a person who  didn&rsquo;t care what other people thought about her but in this instance it  really bugged her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get for being nosy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Boston That Evening</strong></p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I wonder what&rsquo;s taking so long?&rdquo;</strong></em> Sora had been sitting in the doctor&rsquo;s office since they arrived. After  a short introduction with Dr. Everett, someone who Sora considered an  all business type of woman, the doctor pulled Layla away to start on  X-rays. They were gone only a short time but Sora didn&rsquo;t mind. She used  these quiet moments to reflect back on the day they spent together. It  was the perfect day as far as the brunette was concerned. After they  talked in the morning and enjoyed a short but very intimate moment,  both girls spent the day like any other young couple. They talked about  nothing and everything, Sora would entertain Layla with stuff the  blonde missed out at Kaleido Stage and Layla would tell Sora about the  Broadway scene in New York. It was more enjoyable than both realized  and before they knew it they had to leave for the hospital. It had been  an enjoyable day so far. They may have lived together for a brief time  but it was always like an impromptu staring contest, unlike this  morning, which was spent like good friends.</p>
  <p>Sora smiled. <strong><em>&ldquo;More like girlfriends.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
  <p>The  door to the office opened and in walked the woozy looking blonde. It  was one of the only times Sora had seen Layla without her usual elegant  poise. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; asked a concerned Sora.</p>
  <p>Layla nodded and  sat down in the chair next to the brunette as the doctor retook the  seat at her desk. The blonde tried to put up a brave front and  attempted to act more stable but Sora saw through it immediately and  she didn&rsquo;t waste any time by taking Layla&rsquo;s hand supportingly.</p>
  <p>Dr  Everett saw the move and smiled. The two girls introduced themselves as  colleagues and friends but the intimacy of their relationship was as  easy to recognize as night and day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sorry if the test were  somewhat hard but it was necessary to get all your blood works and  shoulder scans. The trioxcilin is probably making you dizzy but it  necessary for the treatment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand doctor, I&rsquo;m just glad we can get this over with soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I need to discuss what we are doing.&rdquo; the doctor reached down and  picked up Layla&rsquo;s clip board. &ldquo;I want to start you on the electrolyte  stimulants as soon as possible. They are prepping for the surgery  tomorrow which is going to be around six in the evening so I hope you  have everything in order for the admittance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla nodded. &ldquo;I have everything I need for the stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,  then we can began immediately and I may be able to bump up the surgery  for sooner.&rdquo; Dr. Everett set down the clipboard and looked at the  blonde. &ldquo;There is just one more technicality that needs to be worked  out. Our hospital policy only allows for family to visit patients  staying in the post ops wing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Sora&rsquo;s turn to speak up this time. &ldquo;Oh, is it a problem if for me to stay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you related to Ms. Hamilton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora shook her head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;m going to say your not allowed to visit Layla once she&rsquo;s admitted.&rdquo;  Dr. Everett hated being mean but rules were rules and she always did  things by the book.</p>
  <p>Layla heard this and her stomach sank. She  knew this surgery was dangerous and she would never admit it but the  whole thing was terrifying her. So many things could go wrong and the  one thing that gave her strength to go through with it was knowing Sora  would be there with her. Now she was being told that might not be  possible and she couldn&rsquo;t have that. &ldquo;Are you sure doctor, Sora is not  just my friend.&rdquo; To emphasize her point, Layla reached down and covered  Sora&rsquo;s hand with her own and gave it a light squeeze.</p>
  <p>The move  caused Sora to smile shyly. Since they started exploring what it meant  to be a couple, the brunette was surprised just how open Layla was  being about their relationship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Ms. Hamilton but we can&rsquo;t make exceptions for girlfriends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  nodded and turned towards Layla. &ldquo;Its ok Layla but I&rsquo;ll visit you as  much as I&hellip;.&rdquo; what ever the smaller girl was going to say was cut off  with Layla sudden outburst.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not my girlfriend.&rdquo; Layla  didn&rsquo;t know what was compelling her but she needed to have the other  girl there when she needed her the most. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; said Dr. Everett as she stared at Layla with a incredulous look upon face. &ldquo;Fianc&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  was also staring at Layla with a shocked expression. Layla then gave  her a covert look that told the brunette to play along. Sora took the  hint and looked at Dr. Everett. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Layla asked me to marry  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I asked?&rdquo; whispered the blonde before she straitened up  and stared at Dr. Everett seriously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I asked her to  marry me and it was very romantic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Okay.&ldquo; said Dr. Everett  slowly. They were both horrible liars and she wanted to laugh at their  efforts but she decided to be lenient for once. &ldquo;In that case I think I  can issue you a badge that will get you pass to the post ops wing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  made Layla let out a sigh of relief. Sora on the other hand had a  million watt smile plastered to her face. &ldquo;Is it really okay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fianc&eacute;es do meet the requirement.&rdquo; Dr. Everett shrugged. &ldquo;This is Massachusetts after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The intercom on the surgeon&rsquo;s desk chose that moment to go off. <em>&ldquo;Doctor Everett, we have the X-rays at radiology like you requested</em>.&rdquo; the doctor nodded and stood up. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fool  and Passion were sitting on the doctor&rsquo;s desk watching, like always,  with amusement. Both girls were still oblivious to each other&rsquo;s guiding  spirit but they could each see their own other worldly pests. <em>&ldquo;When were you going to let us in on this joyous news.&rdquo; </em>said the two spirits at the same time.</p>
  <p>Both girls rolled their eyes at the same time. When the doctor left the room, Sora turned towards Layla. &ldquo;Fianc&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Sora, it just kind of popped out of my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It okay, just a little strange.&rdquo; Sora couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really hope you don&rsquo;t mind. When I heard that you wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed  in I kind of said that without thinking, hoping she would let you stay.  To be honest I don&rsquo;t know if I can go through with this without having  you by my side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you can Layla, you can do anything.&rdquo;  The brunette believed Layla said lied about being engaged for her  benefit. Sora was so excited by the prospect of what the surgery would  mean that her heart absolutely sunk when she heard she wouldn&rsquo;t get to  be there to cheer Layla on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your wrong Sora.&rdquo; When Layla said  this it snapped the smaller girl out of her thoughts and as soon as she  got the other girl&rsquo;s full attention, the blonde continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as  strong as I make myself out to be. After I found that little girl I  used to be deep within my heart I realized that I can&rsquo;t go on living my  life without relying on others. This surgery is terrifying me more than  anything I have ever faced in my life. Not because it&rsquo;s dangerous but  because if it fails I&rsquo;ve lost my last chance of returning to Kaleido  Stage and at this point in my life I don&rsquo;t think I could live without  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora was surprised by this confession. &ldquo;Layla?&rdquo; whispered the smaller girl questioningly.</p>
  <p>The  blonde shook her head and continued. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I need you here every  step of the way Sora. I need your presence to motivate me and above all  else I need to have your support.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will Layla, believe me when I say that my whole heart is behind you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo; Layla let out sigh of relief while Sora reached out and took her hand.</p>
  <p>Fool leaned over and whispered in Passion&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;<em>I never thought I&rsquo;d say this but I feel like I&rsquo;m intruding.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Hush you, this is what I live for.&rdquo; </em>whispered Passion back.</p>
  <p>Sora smiled when she saw that Layla relaxed. &ldquo;Look on the bright side, I&rsquo;m engaged to the great Layla Hamilton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla let out an uncharacteristic giggle. &ldquo;What can I say Sora, I had to make you mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why when you proposed with those puppy dog eyes I couldn&rsquo;t help but say yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Puppy dog eyes?&rdquo; Layla laughed even harder. &ldquo;I have you know I&rsquo;ve never used puppy dog eyes in my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have and with those sky blue eyes I bet you could get anything you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla shrugged. &ldquo;Your right, I did get you to say yes didn&rsquo;t I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  both enjoyed the banter but it was cut off by the arrival of Dr.  Everett. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I interrupted anything but here are your test  results.&rdquo; the doctor held out a large white envelope. &ldquo;Lets get down to  business shall we.&rdquo; said the woman as she sat down and started  explaining the coming procedure.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Kaleido Stage Dormitory</strong></p>
  <p>Rosetta  was doing her dumbbell exercises when there was a knock at her door.  She debated on whether of not she should get up to answer it. When the  knock sounded again she finally got up to get the door and she wasn&rsquo;t  surprised to see who it was. &ldquo;May?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Chinese girl who became Rosetta&rsquo;s mentor stood on the other side of the door nervously. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta  wasn&rsquo;t in the mood for company, least of all the girl who didn&rsquo;t know  the definition of tact. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting kind of late, can you come back  some other time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The black haired girl scoffed at the not so subtle hint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving until you feel better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you care all of the sudden?&rdquo; Rosetta said peevishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be nice so you don&rsquo;t have to be a bitch about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wow, Is calling me a bitch your idea of making me feel better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May&rsquo;s  eye twitched in frustration. &ldquo;Look Rosetta, I&rsquo;ve never been good at  being chummy but I&rsquo;m trying my best. The reason I&rsquo;m doing this is so I  can see my partner be her normal optimistic self. All this moping  around is even depressing me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That pushed Rosetta past her  limits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if my bad mood is inconveniencing you.&rdquo; after the  redhead said that she grabbed her door to slam it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; called  out the oriental girl as she stuck her foot in the doorway,  unfortunately for May, Rosetta already proceeded to slam the door  catching the taller girl&rsquo;s foot in the process. The next words out of  May&rsquo;s mouth was a high pitched wailing. &ldquo;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta gasped out in shock. She didn&rsquo;t mean for that to happen and it made her feel like a monster. &ldquo;Oh god, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May stopped her screaming long enough to give Rosetta a death glare. &ldquo;That hurt dam it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was an accident, please come in and I&rsquo;ll get you some ice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other girl let out a breath to calm her raging temper. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; grunted May as she hopped on one foot into the apartment.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Boston Regional Medical</strong></p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that is pretty much what we plan to do.&rdquo; said Dr. Everett as she finished the tour of the post ops wing.</p>
  <p>Having  already heard what they planed to do in the surgery, Layla was already  prepared for what they were going to do. Sora on the other hand was  green in the face. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everett was confused. &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You really can&rsquo;t be planning on doing that to Layla.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the process.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But stripping the muscle from the bone and then trying to reattach it like that with the whatever it&rsquo;s called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Electrofiber stimulant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  shook her head to get rid of those less than pleasant thoughts. &ldquo;Yes,  that.&rdquo; The brunette realized this operation was more serious than she  originally thought. &ldquo;That sounds so dangerous, are you absolutely sure  Layla will be okay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla stood by quietly throughout Sora&rsquo;s  conversation with her doctor. The smaller girl&rsquo;s concern touched her  deeply and she couldn&rsquo;t help but smile fondly at the lilac haired  woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ok Sora. Dr. Everett is highly qualified and I&rsquo;m sure  everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Layla is right.&rdquo; assured the doctor.  &ldquo;I know your worried about your fianc&eacute;e but I&rsquo;ve fully prepared for  this operation and I&rsquo;m sure it will be a major success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  blushed at the mention of their little white lie. She might have had  her misgivings about this whole thing but she had to have faith. &ldquo;So  what now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor turned to Layla. &ldquo;Now we get you on your  meds. If you would follow me, I&rsquo;ll get you set up in your room.&rdquo; They  all started walking towards the blonde&rsquo;s assigned room when Layla  stopped. &ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I forgot my bag of stuff I&rsquo;ll need  for my hospital stay. I packed it this afternoon but I got distracted  and forgot to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor looked at her watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but we need to get you started now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora cut in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get it for you Layla.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure Sora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The brunette laughed lightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Than you.&rdquo; said Layla as she reached into her purse and produced her hotel and car keys. &ldquo;Here, take the Mustang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>But I don&rsquo;t have a license.&rdquo; </em>replied Sora out of earshot from the doctor.</p>
  <p>Layla leaned over and whispered in the brunette&rsquo;s ear. <em>&ldquo;I wont tell anyone if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>Sora clutched the keys and bowed slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can, you can count on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor interjected. &ldquo;When you get back you can pick up you badge at the front office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arigato.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drive  safely Mrs. Hamilton.&rdquo; said the doctor jokingly. She smirked when she  saw Sora&rsquo;s face turn a dark shade of red. Everett then turned to Layla,  who was doing everything to not make eye contact with her. &ldquo;Or will it  be Mrs. Naegino.&rdquo; This time Dr. Everett laughed when she caused Layla  to blush as well.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Rosetta&rsquo;s Room</strong></p>
  <p>Rosetta  returned to the living room with an ice pack. She watched as May  carefully inspected her swollen foot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly sorry.&rdquo; said the  redhead as she handed the oriental girl the cold ice pack.</p>
  <p>The  taller girl placed the pack on her foot gently, she tried her best not  to whimper but for her best efforts a sound akin to a dog&rsquo;s growl  escaped from her lips. &ldquo;If you truly sorry then you can make it up to  me by telling me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your not going to let this drop are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May shook her head. &ldquo;Now tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you know my mother is also my agent but I&rsquo;m not the only client she  has. She travels around a lot doing one deal after another for the  other people she works for so she rarely ever goes back home. My father  on the other hand works for a small firm in France, so at least he&rsquo;s  always there when you need him. He&rsquo;s always been a kind man that looked  after all of us. Dad was actually the person who bought me my first  Diablo. It was only after my mother saw that I had talent did she push  me to practice and later do it professionally. My family life early on  was not a very good one. Mother and I were always gone and father tried  his best to keep in touch.&rdquo; Rosetta smiled sadly. &ldquo;He is kind of a push  over type which always suited my mother because she can be very  demanding. I always thought they were happy together but I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  two weeks ago my father caught my mother cheating on him.&rdquo; The redhead  sat down in the chair next to May. &ldquo;Dad decided to surprise my mother  with a visit to her apartment in Paris and that&rsquo;s where he caught her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, that&rsquo;s what I said. Mother told me my dad lost it and attacked the man she was with.&rdquo; Rosetta laughed sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why is that funny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you knew my dad you would laugh too. He&rsquo;s a bit on the short side to be picking fights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s where you get that from.&rdquo; joked May.</p>
  <p>Rosetta&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Are you saying I can&rsquo;t fight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May smiled and held up hands in placation. &ldquo;Easy there tiger, I only meant the shortness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Rosetta sighed. &ldquo;Sorry, I guess I&rsquo;m wound up a little tight right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its understandable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  just can&rsquo;t believe my mother did that to him. I never thought she was  the kind of person that would do that. It makes me wonder if she&rsquo;s been  doing this for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So what do they plan to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta kicked her legs back and forth. &ldquo;What everyone would expect, their getting a divorce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  tried to sympathize with Rosetta but it was hard. Her parents would  sooner see the world end than get a divorce. &ldquo;How are you taking it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta looked at May. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The oriental girl started to laugh obnoxiously. &ldquo;Sure you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I&rsquo;ve been a little preoccupied.&rdquo; the redhead shrugged. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t  really affect me so much, I hardly see either of them anyway. I&rsquo;m  really just been pissed at my mother right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As if by summons  the phone started ringing. It rang several times and Rosetta didn&rsquo;t  move an inch to go pick it up. May looked at the other girl strangely.  &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to pick that up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s probably just my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When the phone stopped ringing May spoke up again. &ldquo;That was rude, she&rsquo;s probably just trying to talk it over with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t why she&rsquo;s calling.&rdquo; said Rosetta knowingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She wants her job back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May was confused. &ldquo;Her job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta nodded. &ldquo;Yep, I fired her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It all made a lot more sense to the taller girl. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Things  were quiet between them for several moments before Rosetta started  talking again. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a horrible person for doing that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The black haired girl shrugged. &ldquo;I probably would have done worse. Things will blow over in time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; said Rosetta skeptically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust  me, give yourself a few days away from your thoughts and everything  will move on and you&rsquo;ll be back to normal.&rdquo; the redhead nodded in  response and May just had an idea. &ldquo;Your not going anywhere then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m staying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful waste of a vacation if you ask me, especially when no one will be around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll  give me a chance to perfect the devil&rsquo;s spiral.&rdquo; said Rosetta as she  reached over and poured herself a glass of water from the table pitcher.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How about going on a trip?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; the red haired girl was curious as to where this was going. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  house. I&rsquo;ve been given hell by my family for not visiting them more  often and they made sure that I would come back during the break. To be  honest I could use the company. My brothers can be a hand full and it  would be nice to have a buffer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You really want me to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  responded May as she pointed to her swollen foot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give me a  chance to sick my brothers on you for hurting my foot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosetta wasn&rsquo;t sure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  interrupted the petite girl before she could refuse. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a  choice!&rdquo; Her animated outburst made her accidentally put too much  pressure on her foot and she winced. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m going to let you  mope around here by yourself then your crazy. Maybe if I take in a hard  luck case like Sora would then maybe I&rsquo;ll get enough good karma to  avoid getting my foot slammed on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The smaller woman smiled. That was just May&rsquo;s way of saying please and she accepted. &ldquo;Sure, sounds like fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Layla&rsquo;s Hotel Room</strong></p>
  <p>The  light came on in the room and Sora stepped into Layla&rsquo;s bedroom. She  was looking for the bag she helped the blonde pack this afternoon and  she was trying to remember where they put it. Her search came to an  abrupt stop when she spotted something shiny on the vanity counter.  Sora reached down and picked up the object in between her nails.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>What is this?&rdquo; </strong></em>The metallic object appeared to be a very tiny nail filer. <strong><em>&ldquo;It must belong to Fool but since when does he do his nails?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
  <p>Sora  dropped the mini filer back on the desk and resumed her earlier search.  She finally spotted the bag wedged partly under the bed. Sora got down  on her knees and pulled out the suitcase. She was about to get back up  but then she spotted something white laying under the bed. She debated  whether or not she should be snooping around Layla&rsquo;s belongings but  curiosity got the better of her. The brunette turned to the side and  reached under the bed and grabbed the white object which was also soft  to the touch. When Sora pulled it out she saw that it was a old and  worn white bunny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Wow, Layla owns a stuffed animal.&rdquo;</strong></em> Picturing the blonde with the fluffy toy was so amusing she couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Shiroi usagi.&rdquo; </em>said  Sora to herself, using the Japanese words for white rabbit. When it  came out of her mouth the brunette&rsquo;s earlier mirth disappeared. The toy  was very soft to the touch and Sora ran her hands over it lovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I&rsquo;ve seen this before but where?&rdquo;</strong></em> thought the girl as a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu overtook her.</p>
  <p>Fool  floated above Sora to avoid her attention. He was about to make a snide  comment regarding the rabbit but then he remembered where the bunny  came from. When Sora stopped laughing he wondered if she remembered as  well. <strong><em>&ldquo;To think Layla still had that all this time.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Later at Layla&rsquo;s Hospital Room</strong></p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Where did I put that dam file.&rdquo; </em>said Passion as she drummed her fingers on the bedside desk near to where Layla sat with an IV coming out of her right arm.</p>
  <p>The  doctor was checking the drip to make sure it was coming down at the  right levels. &ldquo;This should do just fine. Make sure you don&rsquo;t move  around and dislodge it very much.&rdquo; Dr. Everett noticed that Layla  hadn&rsquo;t stopped squirming since she got in the room. &ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like hospitals very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Everett nodded. &ldquo;Coming from a healthy person like yourself, I&rsquo;m not  surprised. You probably haven&rsquo;t spent more than a day at a hospital in  your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla winced internally. That wasn&rsquo;t why she hated  hospitals. Images of her mother slowly wasting away before her eyes  popped into her mind. The blonde tried hard to shut out those  unpleasant thoughts.</p>
  <p>The doctor was oblivious to the shift in mood but Passion knew right away what Layla was thinking. &ldquo;<em>Try to look at this more positively madam. This hospital stay isn&rsquo;t about grief, it&rsquo;s about hope.</em>&rdquo; Layla nodded her appreciation of Passion&rsquo;s words of encouragement.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Everett finished her adjustments and stepped back. &ldquo;My job for the time  being is all done. I&rsquo;ll be going, you fianc&eacute;e should be back any minute  now.&rdquo; When the doctor turned around Sora stood at the door with a  suitcase and one hand held behind her back. &ldquo;Speak of the devil. Did  the front desk give you any problems?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora shook her head and pointed to the badge that was on her shirt. &ldquo;This got me through okay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor started laughing. &ldquo;I bet it did.&rdquo; said the woman as she headed out of the room.</p>
  <p>Layla was curious about Dr. Everett&rsquo;s odd behavior. &ldquo;What did she find so funny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  brunette smirked and walked closer so Layla could see the badge. There  on the badge was Sora&rsquo;s picture they took earlier but what caught the  blonde&rsquo;s attention was the name inscribed at the bottom of the tag.  &ldquo;Mrs. Hamilton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora shrugged. &ldquo;Your doctor has a sense of  humor.&rdquo; The brunette put the bag down but kept her other arm behind her  back. &ldquo;Does that hurt?&rdquo; asked the smaller girl who was referring to the  IV coming out of Layla&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; answered the woman. The blonde finally noticed Sora&rsquo;s concealed arm. &ldquo;What do you have behind back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lilac haired girl had an impish grin on her face. &ldquo;Do you mean this?&rdquo;  said Sora as she produced the white rabbit from earlier.</p>
  <p>When  Layla saw her bunny in Sora&rsquo;s hand her eyes grew twice as large.  &ldquo;My&hellip;I&hellip;What are you doing with that?&rdquo; stuttered the blonde as her face  turned dark red.</p>
  <p>Sora patted the bunny on the head. &ldquo;You mean  this little fellow. I found him all alone under your bed and I thought  it would be nice for him to come along and say hi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please Sora, what if people found out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The brunette laughed. &ldquo;You tell people I&rsquo;m your fianc&eacute;e but you get all flustered over a stuffed bunny rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla crossed her arms over her chest and pretended to mad about Sora&rsquo;s teasing.</p>
  <p>Sora held the rabbit in front of her face and started talking in a playful voice. &ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t be mad at Sora. She&rsquo;s was just worried about me mommy.&rdquo;</em> It did the trick and Layla could no long hold her composure. When Layla  started laughing, Sora turned the rabbit around and congratulated it  for job well done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just put it in the bag before the doctor comes back.&rdquo; said Layla when her giggles stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awwww don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; Sora held out the bunny so Layla could take it.</p>
  <p>The  blonde sighed and reached out to take the rabbit but as soon as her  fingers touched the toy she froze. The brunette also stopped in place.  The two girls looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes and both were shocked at  just how familiar this whole moment seemed. The blonde was puzzled over  this weird feeling. &ldquo;Why do I feel like this has happened before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora nodded slowly in agreement. &ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
  <p>Passion  and Fool looked at the two woman with knowing looks on their faces. &ldquo;I  think their starting to remember.&rdquo; whispered Fool to the silver haired  woman.</p>
  <p>The spirit of romance nodded and produced a small glowing crystal. &ldquo;Very true monsieur but this should help them along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fool groaned. &ldquo;Not again&hellip;what&rsquo;s this one do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gem of past sights. This little trinket will unlock old memories.&rdquo; said the woman as she blew softly on the stone.</p>
  <p>The  rock began to glow and Fool noticed a soft light enveloping the two  women. He was waiting for them to become alarmed but they seemed  oblivious.</p>
  <p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
  <p>A  strange feeling came over the two women. Their earlier feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave;  vu was being multiplied a hundred fold as they stared into each other&rsquo;s  eyes. The world that was around them faded and then everything became  dimmer like they were falling asleep. Just when everything became out  of focus a bright light filled their vision and they were gone.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Somewhere in the Past</strong></p>
  <p>This was the greatest day of her life. The lights, the sounds, and last but not least the stunts. <em>&ldquo;Did you see the way the that woman disappeared into the flower daddy.&rdquo; </em>said the lilac haired little girl as she twirled around and around to simulate the show they just watched.</p>
  <p>The man looked down at his ecstatic daughter and shared a smile with his wife. <em>&ldquo;Come now Sora, if you keep doing that your going to get dizzy.&rdquo;</em> the warning came too late. Sora came around on her last spin and  teetered back and forth until she fell down on her butt. She smiled  goofily while her parents shared a warm round of laughter.</p>
  <p>Sora&rsquo;s mother reached down and picked her off the floor so she could hold her. <em>&ldquo;So I take it you enjoyed yourself?&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>The little girl nodded. <em>&ldquo;When I grow up I&rsquo;m going to be an emertainer too.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>The man walked over and ruffled his daughter&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s entertainer Sora, and don&rsquo;t be in such a rush, you have your whole life to choose what you want to be.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Then I want wings so I can fly.&rdquo; </em></p>
  <p>The mother smiled. <em>&ldquo;Of course you do my little angel.&rdquo; </em>she kissed the girl on her forehead and set her down.</p>
  <p>The  mother and father both held one of Sora&rsquo;s hands as they walked down the  main hallway of Kaleido Stage. They wanted to take Sora somewhere  special for her birthday and they were very happy to see their little  girl had enjoyed it. From the way their daughter kept bouncing up and  down, she obviously enjoyed if very much. When they finally reached the  lobby there was a large crowd of kids yelling and screaming at a tanned  man dressed up in rabbit costume. The man had a large sack with him and  he laughed joyously at the children excitement.</p>
  <p>A woman dressed  in a glittering gown walked past Sora&rsquo;s father and the little girl  gasped out in surprise. She turned and tugged at her mother&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;<em>Mommy, look it&rsquo;s the pretty singing lady.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>When  the woman in the gown saw the commotion she started laughing as well.  &ldquo;Kalos, stop teasing the kids and give them what they want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man in the rabbit costume blew a raspberry at the woman. &ldquo;Your no fun Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman waved him off and left. Kalos turned to the mass of kids and  opened up his bag. Inside was a mass of white rabbit toys that he began  throwing into the crowd of cheering children.</p>
  <p>Children not part  of the screaming masses quickly joined in as soon as they saw what the  funny rabbit man was passing out. Sora wasn&rsquo;t an exception. <em>&ldquo;Mommy, daddy, I want a white rabbit too.&rdquo;</em> said the little girl as she broke away from her parents and took off into the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Sora?&rdquo; </em>said the brunette&rsquo;s mother in alarm but her husband put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Let her see if she can get one.&rdquo; </em>they both smiled and joined the rest of the parents who sat back to watch the circus.</p>
  <p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
  <p>Being  born premature made Sora short for her age and it put her at a  disadvantage when it came to grabbing one of the bunnies. No matter how  many times she reached for a rabbit someone would come along and snatch  before she could get it. The little girl was near tears as she watched  all the other kids grasping their toys happily. The rabbit was the  perfect symbol of her happiest day in the whole wide world and she had  to get one. Her hopes were starting to fly out the window as the man  reached into the sack and pulled out the last one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry kids but  this is the only one I have left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Usagi!&rdquo; called out Sora who jumped as high as she could to get the man&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Shiroi usagi!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kalos  wished he brought more but he didn&rsquo;t account for such a large turnout.  The owner of Kaleido Stage sighed and tossed the last rabbit into the  crowd.</p>
  <p>Sora saw the bunny fly through the air and she pushed with  all of her might to get to it. When she saw the toy heading straight  for her, the little girl jumped with everything she had. Time seemed to  slow down and she watched the spinning rabbit come closer and closer.  Her heart sank as she saw another hand reach up for bunny but fate was  on her side as the little toy flew into her outstretched hand. Anyone  who watched would have been shocked to see such the little girl jump  well past her own height but Sora&rsquo;s will pushed her beyond the limits  of what was considered normal.</p>
  <p>Her jump was so high it beat the  other hand that went for the bunny but the problem happened when it was  time for Sora to come down. She gasped out in shock as gravity took  hold of her and spun her face forward towards the ground. She might  have been injured but her fall was broken by the other person that went  for the rabbit. They landed in a tumble and Sora accidentally bumped  her head against a hard surface that just happened to be the head of  the person she was now laying on. Sora got off of the soft surface and  rubbed her forehead with the hand that wasn&rsquo;t firmly wrapped around the  stuffed animal. When Sora opened her eyes she was staring at a taller  girl with bright blue eyes and golden hair. &ldquo;Gomen nasai.&rdquo; said Sora as  she did a little bow.</p>
  <p>The blonde stopped rubbing her sore head  and looked at the girl who got the rabbit. She tried everything to get  one but it just wouldn&rsquo;t happen. The girl nearly cried before she saw  the bunny man throw the last one straight for her. Her smile could have  lit up the stage when it looked like she was going to get one. When she  reached out to receive the small toy a purple mass came out of nowhere  and landed right on her. She couldn&rsquo;t contain her disappointment when  she opened her eyes and saw a smaller lilac haired girl clutching the  little rabbit. The blonde girl looked back to see if the bunny man had  another one but he was already gone and all the kids began to disperse  clutching their toys happily. It was too much to take and the tears  started to fall from her eyes.</p>
  <p>Sora watched as the pretty girl  started to cry and it worried her that she may have caused it. &ldquo;Gomen  nasai.&rdquo; Sora noticed the little girl was looking at the rabbit and she  realized the blonde wanted it too. &ldquo;Suki desu ka?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blonde didn&rsquo;t understand what the smaller girl was saying. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora smiled and held out the toy. &ldquo;Usagi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other girl stopped crying and she looked at the little girl strangely. &ldquo;You want me to have it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  didn&rsquo;t understand what the blue eyed girl was saying either but she was  happy to see the crying stop. &ldquo;Dozo.&rdquo; said the brunette as she motioned  for Layla to take the rabbit.</p>
  <p>The blonde wasn&rsquo;t sure at first but  she reached out and touched the soft toy, when she was sure that the  other girl was giving it to her she took it and hugged it to her chest.  &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said the little girl with a giant smile.</p>
  <p>That smile was worth a gazilion white bunnies as far as Sora was concerned and she laughed happily to see she caused it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Layla?  Layla?&rdquo; called out a man who was walking up to the girls with a  beautiful blonde woman right behind him. &ldquo;I was wondering where you ran  off to. You had me and you mother worried sick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come now Richard, can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; said the beautiful blonde.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She shouldn&rsquo;t have run off like that Rola.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blonde shrugged. &ldquo;What do you have there Layla?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little girl, that looked so much like her mother, held up the white bunny for her to see. &ldquo;Look I have one, I have one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see that, it&rsquo;s a very nice looking rabbit by way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla nodded. &ldquo;This girl gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rola smiled as she leaned down to look at the little girl. &ldquo;That was very kind of you. May I ask what your name is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora  was getting a little nervous. The brunette would have been even more  nervous talking to strangers but she could see the lady had kind eyes.</p>
  <p>Layla interrupted her mother. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t understand because she speaks a weird linguini.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Richard laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s language. Linguini is what we had for supper last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  speaks Japanese.&rdquo; came a heavily accented voice from an oriental man.  Him and another oriental woman walked up and stood next to Sora..</p>
  <p>Sora smiled and turned to her parents. &ldquo;<em>I got a bunny but I gave it to this girl to make her smile and it worked.&rdquo; </em></p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo; </em>said the man as he turned to American family. &ldquo;I sorry to have disturbed you but we must be going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Richard  nodded and bent down to whisper in Layla&rsquo;s ear. When he was done he  stepped back and watched as Layla did a little bow to Sora. &ldquo;Domo  arigato gozaimasu.&rdquo; said the blonde girl in the best mimic of what her  father just told her.</p>
  <p>Sora giggled with delight and everyone  shared a little laugh. This was the perfect day for all of them, one  they would probably remember forever. The Japanese family left soon  after and Layla watched the other girl walk away. She owed her little  souvenir to the lilac haired girl and she never even got her name.</p>
  <p>Rola saw Layla hug the little toy to her chest. &ldquo;So what are you going to name him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little girl&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Usagi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a perfect name, just remember to always cherish him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will mommy.&rdquo; said the little girl as she and her parents happily headed out of the Kaleido Stage.</p>
  <p>Leaning  against a pillar stood a foot long spirit named Fool. He wasn&rsquo;t wearing  a mask and his hair was much shorter but it certainly was the spirit of  the stage. &ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; said a man that looked hauntingly like Yuri.</p>
  <p>The spirit hovered over to the man as they made their way out of the Kaleido Stage. &ldquo;I sensed a powerful presence in those two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The spirit shrugged. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter, I&rsquo;m sure fate will take care of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I find you sneaking into the girls dressing room again I&rsquo;m going to flush you down the toilet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Layla&rsquo;s Hospital Room: Present</strong></p>
  <p>When  the light faded, Sora and Layla were once again in the hospital room.  The force of the vision made them drop the toy and Sora stumble  backwards. They were both panting when they regained their all their  senses. The brunette was the first one to speak up. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla  slowly looked at Sora. Her whole her perspective on their relationship  changed with the recollection of one tiny memory. &ldquo;You the one who gave  me Usagi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora nodded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe your the girl from that day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess the tryouts wasn&rsquo;t the first time we met.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess not.&rdquo; Sora let out a calming breath. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe the day  that made me become a performer was the very same day I met the woman I  fell in love with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla eyes became as wide as saucers. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora realized what she just said and it was too late to take it back. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;I.. What I meant was&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Layla  just sat there dumbfounded. Having those feelings for Sora were  something she accepted on her part but hearing the other girl, in her  own words, say that she loved her was something completely different.  &ldquo;Sora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The brunette sighed. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you mean it.&rdquo; asked the blonde calmly.</p>
  <p>Sora  figured it was time to be completely honest, both to Layla and to  herself. &ldquo;I meant what I said. I know it&rsquo;s all very sudden but you have  to realize that it isn&rsquo;t for me. I&rsquo;ve had these feelings for a long  time and it was only recently did I realize what they meant. It was  love, the once in a lifetime kind of the love that moves your entire  being. Having all those feelings are burning me up inside and its too  painful to hold back anymore. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is&hellip;&rdquo; the  brunette paused to summon her courage. &ldquo;I love you Layla Hamilton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sincerity of Sora &rsquo;s declaration moved her deeply. Her feelings for  Sora changed a lot since she met her. At first she was jealous and  threatened by her but later the brunette&rsquo;s very presence was the only  thing that made her feel excited and alive. Now looking at the woman  who stood nervously before her, she couldn&rsquo;t even imagine the brunette  not being a part of her life and she really didnt want to.</p>
  <p>Layla looked at the smaller girl with moist eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy Sora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo;  Sora wasn&rsquo;t expecting that response. She thought that Layla was going  to be freak out for sure. &ldquo;Your not weirded out that I love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora was relieved to know that Layla wasn&rsquo;t freighted by her feelings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you feel that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; answered the brunette sheepishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you to know that I lo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Layla!&rdquo; interrupted a man&rsquo;s voice before she could finish.</p>
  <p>Both girls turned towards the door and saw Mr. Hamilton standing there. &ldquo;Father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there a reason your in this hospital?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora turned to Layla. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blonde shook her head. &ldquo;What are you doing here dad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Hamilton came into the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  brunette saw that things were getting very tense so she attempted to  sound cheerful. &ldquo;Mr. Hamilton we didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Richard  noticed the visitor&rsquo;s badge that Sora was wearing when she turned  around to greet him. &ldquo;Oh god!&rdquo; said the man as he read it.</p>
  <p>The  brunette saw what he was looking at and she hastily covered it with her  hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what you think, it was a joke by the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Hamilton massaged the bridge of his nose, a habit he picked up when he was trying to control his emotions. &ldquo;Sora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora and Layla were both shocked by the venomousness of the man&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Father I asked Sora to be here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just want to have a few words with my daughter if that&rsquo;s all right with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sora bowed slightly. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The brunette turned to leave but Layla stopped her. &ldquo;Sora, I don&rsquo;t want you to leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its  okay Layla, you have a talk with your father. I&rsquo;ll be right back  later.&rdquo; Sora walked over and picked up Usagi and placed him on the bed  before she turned and left. As she walked towards the door Sora  couldn&rsquo;t help but think the man that worried over his daughter back at  Kaleido Stage all those years ago, wasn&rsquo;t the same man that stood in  the room now.</p>
  <p>When Sora was gone Mr. Hamilton stared at his daughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting a stop to this.&rdquo;</p>
