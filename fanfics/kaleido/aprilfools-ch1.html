<h1>April? Fools Day</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kaleido/index.html">Kaleido Star</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wdv.html">WdV</a><br> </h2>
</font></b><font size="2"><p>	Sora asks the fool, “Do you think she’ll show up this late, 
it is 1:00 AM?”</p>

<p>	Fool appears a little nervous but answers, “Well yes, I think she did read the note 
I put in her locker, had too, it was in her shoe.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Fool, she does leave barefoot sometimes when she’s going home to practice some more 
you remember.” Sora complained. </p>

<p>	Fool laughs at Sora, “Well you should have just went on home with her, you two would 
be together now to discuss this but no, you didn’t want anyone else to see you together, is 
that the way you‘re going to live your lives then, hide from everyone here then, hide from 
us all?”</p>

<p>	Sora starred at the door a long minute but did answer fool, “Well we just don’t want 
everyone to know right yet because if her father should find out somehow before she breaks 
the news to him a little more gentle, it would be more of a problem for all of us, he does 
still own half of this place yet. Well Layla does own the other half now too but still?”</p>

<p>	Fool humors her with a Fool sized chuckle but does say, “Well if she doesn’t hurry 
up, he’ll find out about the others and suspect you two anyway. Remember they are a lot more 
open about their feeling towards each other, their partners.”</p>

<p>	Sora mumbles “Yes all of them and I’m jealous too, wished we could show it more even 
to our very close girl friends here but we’ll just have to wait I guess but why do we have 
to be the last one‘s?”</p>

<p>	Fool laughed at Sora again, said, “Well everyone here knew about Anna and Mia for a 
long while now and maybe even suspected May and Sarah rooming together so long after Carlos 
took that long vacation to Vegas alone and came back dead broke but who would have ever 
thought Rosetta and Marion would get together like that?”</p>

<p>	Sora glared at Fool and half yelled, “Fool, they’re only staying in the same room 
now that John has let his little girl out of his sight finally, don’t make them partners at 
their ages just yet, but they do make a cute couple. Besides Fool, at what young age do 
girls feel a loving attraction for other girls more so than they do boys anyway, hopefully 
older than Marion but still they are cute.”</p>

<p>	Fool looks at Sora, said “Well with all the main ring girls partnering up and you 
two really are together all the time now anyway, don’t you think he knows something’s up?” 
</p>

<p>	There was a faint but quick knock on the door and it opened , in rushed Layla still 
looking out to make sure no one seen her just walk in like she owned the place and the room 
occupants as well, gee she does practically.  </p>

<p>	Sora raced to her side and gives her a super hug and a light kiss on her cheek, 
asks, “Have any problem getting out or is he home now?” </p>

<p>	Layla returns Sora’s bone crushing hug only a lot lighter, smiles and asks, “Didn’t 
you remember he went to Europe this morning and wont be back till we open the show on Monday 
night?” </p>

<p>	Layla pulls Sora to the sofa and on her lap giving her a quick lip peck before 
answering Sora’s question even before she asks it, “Yes Sora, she had my beg packed as soon 
as she found the note Fool left but why didn’t you just ask me to stay tonight with you 
anyway? Our lives are ours alone but sometimes I get the feeling we do have to share a 
little of it with Fool here.”</p>

<p>	Sora complains swatting at him, “Well yes Layla but we have to figure out how to get 
him to stay in the other room while we shower and dress you know?”        	</p>

<p>	Fool was hovering along the wall but started towards the door as he said, “Or 
undress girls.” </p>

<p>	Both girls picked up pillows from the sofa and give them a rocket throw right at 
Fool just about to the door already. Layla had a better shot angle and knocked him on into 
the other room with him still yelling, “I was kidding, I was kidding.” </p>

<p>	Layla pulled a ball of twine from her back pocket smiling at Sora, said, “We can 
always do it the way you used too Sora, Tie him up and just let him hang there alone the 
rest of the night.” </p>

<p>	Sora was closest and quickly grabbed him. When Layla got there she started wrapping 
him up tight enough to hold him.  With fool hanging in the door way secure, Layla and Sora 
grabbed their sleep wear and headed to the bath room finally. They did spend a few minutes 
in the shower with soap and massaging each others bodies well with caressing fingers. They 
got out and dried each other as well and each slipped the others skimpy sleeping shirt over 
the others heads. With a gentle kiss to each others lips, they headed out to the bed to lay 
and get a little sleep if they could keep their wondering fingers off the others bodies. 
With both needing sleep after their long work out today, they did kiss and lay close in arms 
but did manage some sleep also. </p>

<p>	Sora woke first and scooted out from Layla’s arms and run to the bath room to potty. 
While she was in there Layla woke also and figured Sora was in the bath room so she went on 
in to join her. Sora smiled as Layla scooted in behind her in the small shower as arms 
circled each other again and lips met under the water for a quick moment of needed passion 
from both girls. </p>

<p>	Layla kissed Sora gentle and backed out of Sora’s arms, said, “I better dress first 
and get to the practice ring; you wait 10 minutes and then show up. Maybe no one will 
suspect a thing that way, think?”    </p>

<p>	Sora held on to Layla for a long minute, said, “Layla it just keeps getting harder 
to let you go each time we’re together you know love?”</p>

<p>	Layla hugged Sora tight this time, said, “I know my love but we’ll have to wait till 
I get the nerve to let father know. I don‘t like this running around and hiding any more 
than you do remember? I can‘t stand being away from you any longer so I plan to tell him 
Monday night somehow, maybe Fool has an idea now on how, think?” </p>

<p>	Sora said, “Dang, we forgot fool hanging in there yet. I better go get him down 
before he really gets upset with us. You go on and I‘ll be there after I get him down and 
get him something to eat, maybe that‘ll calm him some, love ya.” </p>

<p>	Sora finally got him unwrapped from the twine to let him breath better but right off 
he said, “Sora, I heard you two talking and I’ll tell you both one more time, just tell him, 
come right out in front of him and tell him you two are going to get married no matter what, 
OK? The trick is to tell him in such a way that he can’t respond the way you think he will 
because of public embarrassment to himself, tell Layla that this morning and she‘ll think of 
something, somehow.”</p>

<p>	Sora finally got out and over to the practice ring but only had a few seconds to 
tell Layla just what Fool told her to tell her. Layla was confused but right off had some 
kind of an idea.</p>

<p>	The girls stayed away from each other for the next two nights, liked to killed both 
of them too but they knew the show Monday night had to be perfect so Mr. Hamilton wouldn‘t 
suspect anything. They both practiced their parts to perfection along with the rest for this 
first time new show here at Kaliedo Stage. </p>

<p>	It was getting close to opening time on Monday, Sora hadn’t yet talked to Layla once 
over the weekend and she was getting a little stage fright to speak, had no idea just what 
Layla had planned and was starting to think she might be left out in the cold here maybe.  
Layla was walking in the hall and almost run into Sora as they turned the corner there into 
each other. Layla smiled, said, “stand right by me in our final curtain call at the end of 
the show,” and walked on down the hall as she did have two more performers with her right 
then.</p>

<p>	Sora thought, well she hasn’t given up on us yet anyway, she must have something 
planned for Mr. Hamilton’s benefit tonight then, I hope anyway. </p>

<p>The show started on time and the first few performers did their acts to perfection which 
should look good for her father anyway. Everyone’s part went well, a lot better than most 
new shows on opening nights. Of course the best Act for the end kind of their part of the 
show was Layla and Sora with a performance close to the twin Angel maneuvers they been 
working on hard to perfect and it was perfect too with them both coming down the ropes 
almost in each others arms with the crowd cheering loud enough to remove the roof as well. 
</p>

<p>	Layla’s foot hit the floor first and she motioned the stage hand closest for a mic 
to use but strange a performer closer handed Layla hers, their own stage Musical/Vocalist 
Sarah with a huge smile now hopping this was going to be their big moment as well. Layla 
smile at and hugged Sarah, said, “Thanks Sarah” and turned back to the audience this time to 
speak. Layla looked around and said, “I’ve seen most of you at all of our new productions 
and I consider all of you friends and family here at Kaleido Stage so I’m inviting all of 
you back here next Sat. afternoon to a very special public Engagement Announcement party for 
two of our very own home grown younger stars, Rosetta and Marion. </p>

<p>	Don’t mean they’re getting married next week, next year but when they’re both ready 
and of age, OK? Next we have the Wedding Announcements right now for three of, maybe more 
Weddings next Sat. also, could be two, three, or maybe more couples here at Kaleido Stage 
you all know well, see them in every production we put on. The first couple is our newest 
clown act and partners, Anna and Mia will be married next Sat. Our second couple is a pair 
that doesn’t really match in what they do around here but I’m sure they’ll match as partners 
married, Sarah and May. Next we do have another couple or so lined up but they want it to be 
a surprise to all of you then. Our final and probably the most important time in my life is 
my own wedding and to my most beautiful creature on this planet, Sora Nigeneo. All of our 
performer friends from all over the world have already been invited and I know they would 
welcome all of you as our guests as well, be here next Saturday, please.</p>

<p>	No one in the audience said a word, dead still. Only a couple of things did happen 
though, Carlos made a thud when he hit the floor unconscious to find out his X beloved Sarah 
was marring May next Saturday and Mr. Hamilton yelling “Layla you’re out of the Hamilton 
family wealth for good this time, you little-winch you” Layla walked out a little ways and 
looked around at everyone, said, “Everyone this is no joke, Sora and I do love each other. 
So do Anna and Mia, and Sarah and May and our young ones as well or we wouldn’t be out here 
humiliating ourselves or you like this, we do love our partners very much. We only hoped all 
of you; our audience and family over the years would support us in our Marriages as well. 
Love is where you find it no matter the gender or age, love is love period, a precious 
commodity we all need a lot more of these days. Don’t shun us for loving someone back that 
loves us as much as we love them, please. Everyone come to our Weddings here next Sat., 
bring guests if you want please.”  </p>

<p>	Then it all happened at once almost, a loud roar of the audience as they were 
emptying the stands running yelling yes and happy for all of you girls. All running to the 
center ring to congratulate all our cute couples all standing with their partners arm in arm 
now to show off their prize to everyone along with the matching blue diamond engagement 
rings that Layla got for all the girls each, even Marion and Rosetta had the same rings for 
their future. </p>

<p>	Seamed like an hour or better when the crowd thinned out to leave all our new 
couples to be next Saturday standing looking at each other, they all let out big laughs and 
all hugged each other. Layla ask “ok girls what we going to do for an on core now, any 
ideas?”  Sarah yawned and said, “well we could go to bed, I’m really tired tonight girls. 
Then of all girls, Marion said, “yea, sure Sarah, I seen how you can’t keep your eyes off 
May in her skimpy leotard body suit there, I’ll bet she’ll really be tired in an hour 
though. Rosetta said, “God my partner just said that? I thought all this time you were the 
little innocent one here, gee just how old are you anyway?” Marion smiled, said, “Old enough 
Rosetta my love.” Layla said, “dang girls, let’s change the subject or she’ll have us all 
ending up there tonight already.” Rosetta said, “Gee Marion, you probably know a lot more 
about that stuff than I do, where have you learned all this stuff anyway?” Marion laughed 
this time, said, “Be surprised what you learn around here if you stand behind the stage 
curtains, really.” </p>

<p>	Rosetta took Marion’s hand and said, “Come on young lady, we’re going back to our 
room and you can just teach me some of the things you’ve learned from behind the curtains 
then, alright love?”  Everyone laughed at the two young ones as they left for their room to 
really have some fun now, looked like. </p>

<p>	Layla laughed but said, “well girls with you other two couples living together all 
the time anyway, you can do it anytime but it’s been a while for Sora and I so how about us 
really head to our rooms, I’m with Sora tonight if anyone wants to know to get caught up on 
some over due loven with my darlin here, OK? And just think, we can do this legal after the 
ceremony next Saturday afternoon, right girls, I can‘t wait either to show everybody my new 
wife here.” Layla turned to Sora and took her into her arms so gentle and kissed her as the 
passionate lovers they are. The other couples did the same, Anna almost had Mia in the prawn 
position lips together and May was climbing up Sarah’s body kissing all the way to her lips 
as well. Anna said, “Girls, we better get to our rooms before this gets out of hand and into 
someone’s body, think?” Everyone laughed but they did head for their rooms too. </p>

<p>	Everyone was gone now except someone mumbling something in the distance, Mr. 
Hamilton said “Carlos wake up, we can still make a lot of money here.” He was poking some 
numbers into his calculator, said, “Dang, I might have to beg Layla back into our family 
now. With everyone here tonight all going down to congratulate the girls on their Marriages 
to other girls here on the Kaliedo stage, And probably all of them will come back Saturday 
with extra guests for their Weddings, that’s more show attendance for the future here you 
know. We could advertise all them as the largest group of Lesbian performers anywhere, we 
could make a killing. Carlos “wake up.”</p>

<p>	Fool setting over a ways thinking out loud, “He’s the real fool to think more of his 
money than his own daughters love and happiness.”</p>
