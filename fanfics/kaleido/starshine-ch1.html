<pre>Sora cupped the tea cup in her cold hands.  Her adrenalin had subsided, 
and that rush of excitement during training no longer warmed her limbs.  
She glanced to the right, over at Layla who seemed so composed after 
their intense training.  Sora sighed and thought, &quot;Layla&#39;s so strong, 
she doesn&#39;t even look tired.&quot;

&quot;Are you sleepy already?&quot;  Sora bolted upright at Layla&#39;s question.  

&quot;Umm... no...&quot;  said Sora as she grinned to hide her surprise.  She 
reached forward to pour herself a third cup of tea.  The tea pot gurgled 
until it filled half her cup and splashed out a few more drops.  She 
decided to change the topic.  &quot;Who do you think is badder?  A robber or 
a pirate?&quot;

Layla gave Sora a puzzled look.  She thought for a second and said, 
&quot;Perhaps a pirate... a pirate pillages and plunders and then makes off 
with the loot.&quot;

Sora nodded in agreement.  She sipped a bit of tea.  &quot;Do you like being 
a pirate, Layla-san?&quot;

&quot;Are you saying that I&#39;m bad?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no... I mean, whenever you&#39;re on stage, you look like you&#39;re 
ready to pillage and plunder.&quot;

Layla smiled.  &quot;I hope so!  I wouldn&#39;t be much of a pirate if I can&#39;t 
show our guests that I am!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah!&quot;  Sora giggled. 

Layla giggled as well.  &quot;So if I&#39;m the pirate, that makes you a robber.&quot;  
she declared jokingly.

&quot;Yeah, I guess so... but compared to you, I&#39;m not such a good robber.&quot;  
said Sora ruefully.

&quot;Why do you say so?&quot;  asked Layla.

&quot;Because I haven&#39;t been able to steal anything from you!&quot;  Sora smiled 
widely.

Layla let out a little laugh in spite of herself.  She leaned back and 
sighed as she glanced at the clock.  &quot;Mm.  I suppose I should let you 
sleep.&quot;  she said remorsefully.  Their previous conversation had been 
interesting and she felt so comfortable sitting and sipping tea 
together.

&quot;Umm... Layla-san, if you still want to train, I&#39;m up for it.&quot;  said 
Sora brightly.  If Layla was going to stay up and train, she will too.

Layla&#39;s eyebrows went up with her declaration, and she smiled inwardly 
at Sora&#39;s enthusiasm.  &quot;I think we&#39;ve done enough for today.&quot;  Layla 
stood up.  &quot;But sleep always helps performance, so we better get some.&quot;

Sora downed her tea quickly and gagged with her scalded tongue. 
&quot;Hakk!!!&quot;  She stood up abruptly and at attention.  &quot;Yes!&quot;

Layla watched Sora with a bemused expression and suppressed a chuckle at 
Sora&#39;s behavior.  &quot;We can sleep below deck.  There are two beds down 
there.&quot;

Layla and Sora put the dishes away since the ship occasionally rocked 
from side to side.  Then they made their way down to the lower deck.  

&quot;There&#39;s a cabin over here by the stern and another one by the bow.  If 
you need to brush your teeth, the bathroom is over here.&quot;  Layla 
gestured to each location.  Sora nodded and quickly gauged the size of 
the bed in each cabin.  

&quot;Umm... I&#39;ll sleep over here.&quot;  Sora hefted her duffel bag and made her 
way to the bow. 

Layla nodded and went to the cabin at the stern.  She opened her 
suitcase on a table and discovered that she forgot to pack the pajamas 
that Sora lent her.  Unsure of what to do, she paused for a few moments.  
And then it dawned on her that she was not in Sora&#39;s room tonight.  She 
pulled out the negligee and felt its silky softness in her hands.  
&quot;Father knows how to spoil me&quot;, she thought.  She put it on and went to 
check on Sora. &quot;Sora... did you need anything?&quot;  She paused on the 
threshold of Sora&#39;s cabin. 
 
&quot;Umm... I&#39;m okay. Ehehehe... &quot;  Sora said nervously as she buttoned her 
shirt.  Her voice caught in her throat when she saw Layla in her 
negligee so close.  The cabin was much smaller than her room which made 
Sora more conscious of Layla&#39;s presence.

Sora&#39;s tone of voice was odd and Layla thought something was amiss.  She 
took a step into the cabin and felt her foot slide a bit.  Layla looked 
down.

&quot;Water on the floor?&quot; she thought.  Her eyes searched the room and 
noticed that one of the hatches was ajar.  She strode to the bed and 
felt the covers.  

&quot;It&#39;s soaked.&quot;  She made a note to reprimand the crew later.  Layla 
yanked on the hatch, but it wouldn&#39;t close all the way.  &quot;you can&#39;t 
sleep here.  You&#39;ll catch a cold.&quot;

&quot;Umm... It&#39;s okay.  I&#39;ll just sleep on top of the bed with my sleeping 
bag.&quot;  replied Sora.  Layla had done so much to train her, and she 
didn&#39;t want to be a bother anymore.

&quot;No.  I won&#39;t allow it.&quot;  Layla said firmly.

Sora felt her cheeks warm up.  She began to protest, &quot;But it&#39;s 
alright... really...&quot;

Layla grabbed Sora&#39;s hand.  &quot;She&#39;s cold.&quot;  she thought.  &quot;I guess the 
tea wasn&#39;t enough to warm her up.&quot;  She turned in the direction of the 
stern and tugged insistently at Sora&#39;s hand.  &quot;Come.  You can sleep on 
the other bed.&quot;

Sora&#39;s heart began to race.  She didn&#39;t dare to hope.  &quot;Bu-- but where 
will you sleep?&quot; she asked as she followed Layla to the other cabin.

Layla tilted her head to one side.  &quot;Here.&quot;  She let go of Sora&#39;s hand 
and closed the door behind them.

The door clicked closed with finality and Sora felt her knees weaken and 
her stomach flip over.  She swayed slightly.  She watched as Layla 
pulled the bed covers aside and crawled to the other side of the bed.  
The slit of her negligee revealed the soft curves of her leg as she 
crawled.  Sora had seen Layla in her leotard and tights many times, but 
somehow, the negligee made her more... feminine... more... alluring.  
Sora shook her head.  She looked around quickly.  &quot;I hope Fool isn&#39;t 
here...&quot;  she thought.

Layla slipped under the covers on the other side of the bed. She glanced 
over at Sora. &quot;You can take this side.&quot;  Layla patted to her right.  
&quot;The switch is behind you.  Turn off the lights.&quot;

Sora flicked the switch and swallowed hard.  &quot;Al-right.&quot;  She put her 
arms in front of her and moved towards the bed in the dark.  Suddenly, 
the boat lurched and Sora was flung forward.  &quot;Aahh...&quot;

She landed on the bed face forward onto something soft and warm.  The 
scent of cologne tickled her nostrils.  She felt something around her 
head.

Layla felt something land on her chest.  She felt it with her hands and 
recognized hair.  She guessed that it was Sora&#39;s head.  &quot;Are you ok, 
Sora?&quot;  she said as her hands moved down to Sora&#39;s shoulders.  

Sora realized where she was and blushed in embarrassment.  She didn&#39;t 
want to be any more of a burden to Layla.  She lifted herself away from 
Layla&#39;s breasts.  &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;  She began to move away.

&quot;Wait.&quot;  Layla held Sora&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;There&#39;s one more thing we can 
synchronize.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  asked Sora.  She peered into the dark to figure out where Layla 
was.

&quot;Our breathing.&quot;  Layla rolled to her right to face Sora.  &quot;Lie on your 
side, please.&quot;

Sora did as she was told and lay on her left side.  She could sense 
Layla&#39;s long body in front of her.  There was a slight breeze near her 
face.  Then Sora realized that it wasn&#39;t a breeze, but Layla&#39;s soft 
breath.  Sora felt Layla&#39;s hand move from her shoulder and down her arm.  
It stopped at the nook of her waist.  She sensed Layla shifting her 
weight and a subtle increase of warmth in front of her.

&quot;Try and match my breathing.&quot; instructed Layla.

Sora closed her eyes and tried to focus on the breeze before her.  It 
was so soothing and comforting.  She tried to follow along and began to 
relax.

&quot;Not quite there yet...  Come closer.&quot;

Sora shifted herself forward. 

&quot;Closer.&quot;  Layla slid her hand behind Sora and pulled her against her 
body.  She sensed Sora&#39;s bangs before her.  Smiling, she leaned forward 
until she pressed her forehead against Sora&#39;s.  &quot;Ah, she&#39;s much warmer 
now.&quot;  she thought.

Sora was at a loss.  A wave of sensations were overwhelming her.  The 
soft breaths, the rustling of Layla&#39;s negligee against her pajamas, the 
scent of cologne and Layla&#39;s shifting movements against her body were 
all assaulting her senses.  Her stomach did several somersaults.  Sora 
fought hard to still her racing heart.  Her skin tingled with every 
subtle brush against Layla&#39;s silky negligee.  Her cheeks burned as 
sensed Layla&#39;s forehead against hers.  &quot;This is soooo not easy.&quot;  
thought Sora as she swallowed again.

&quot;Don&#39;t tense up.  Relax.&quot;  said Layla.  She had to say it to calm 
herself as well.  Holding Sora so close to her was nothing like she 
expected.  She felt giddy and unusually happy to finally hold Sora in 
her arms.  &quot;Finally?&quot;  she thought.  &quot;Why would I want that... why does 
she entice me so?&quot;  Layla pushed the thoughts away and tried to focus on 
synchronizing with Sora.  She unconsciously hugged Sora closer.  An odd 
tingle raced up her spine.  Her nipples tickled as they pushed against 
Sora&#39;s chest.  &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve felt like this...  what&#39;s 
going on with me?&quot;  she thought.

Calmed by Layla&#39;s voice, Sora took several deep breaths and tried to 
focus on Layla&#39;s breathing.
Sora took one more deep breath and released it slowly. She relaxed 
against Layla and sensed Layla&#39;s breathing.  She felt Layla&#39;s chest rise 
as she inhaled and sink as she exhaled.  Sora followed each motion and 
breath to the best of her ability.  Soon, she was able to sense a 
rhythm.

&quot;Good... keep that up.&quot;  whispered Layla.  &quot;Until we fall asleep.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;  Sora replied softly.  Her body glowed with warmth as she held 
Layla against her.  Soon, her consciousness slowly slipped away to a 
vision of her and Layla in each other&#39;s arms floating in a sea of light.  

When the storm broke, they made it in time for the performance.  Though 
they dueled each other on the boat, they partook of a dance whose 
rhythms were known only to the two of them.  It was a fiery dance that 
defied the storm and whose heat can only be matched by the growing 
flames in their hearts.
