<pre>Sora doko?! : The Amazing Final Judgment! Behold the Blue Dragon Kaleido 
Knight!
 

Phoenix Reborn was a success. Layla finally found her phoenix and 
realize that Sora was the only person she needs in this world. After a 
month the Phoenix Reborn&#39;s success, Mr. Hamilton organized a party for 
its success and of course for Layla. Everyone in the Kaleido stage was 
invited even Jonathan. Layla was thrilled about the party because it 
means she and Sora will have a lot of opportunity to talk.

&quot;Here....&quot; Layla handed the invitation to Sora.

&quot;Hmm? What&#39;s this Ms. Layla? Invitation?&quot; Sora asked.

&quot;Yes. My father organized a party for exclusive for Kaleido staff and 
friends only.&quot;

&quot;ohh! Sounds like fun! So you visited us all the way here just to 
deliver this Ms. Layla?&quot;

Layla just smiled and said...

&quot;No.... My father sent the invitations by mail but I wanted to give 
yours personally. The party will be held for a week. I&#39;m looking forward 
that we can talk as much as we can. My father already made reservations 
for all. I hope you don&#39;t mind but I was wondering if we can sleep in 
one room?&quot;

Layla never had those sincere eyes like that while talking. She really 
did want Sora to be close to her more than anyone else.

Sora just gave her usual appreciative smile. &quot;Of course... I&#39;d love that 
Ms. Layla.&quot;

&quot;Ms. Layla? I hope after the party she would call me Layla. I don&#39;t to 
be only your partner or just a friend... I want you to be close to me, 
close enough for you to be able to call me Layla, close enough for you 
to need me more than anyone in your life&quot; thought Layla.

A red head girl was running around looking for someone. She saw Layla 
and Sora talking. She waved her hand and started calling out. &quot;Sora! Ms. 
Layla!&quot; 

As soon as she was close enough, she grabbed Sora&#39;s arm happily and 
caused them to spin. 

&quot;Huh? Ohh! Its you Rosetta...&quot; said Sora with a happy smile.

Layla noticed the closeness of the two and it made her a little bit sad. 
&quot;Rosetta... her new dance partner...It should have been me...&quot;
 
&quot;I guess I have to go now Sora, Rosetta... &quot; She tried to ignore her 
feelings.

&quot;Umm... okay Ms. Layla. I hope to see you soon.&quot; Sora looked at the 
invitation.

&quot;See you Ms Layla! C&#39;mon Sora! It&#39;s time for practice! I&#39;m so excited.&quot; 
exclaimed Rosetta and dragged Sora away.

Sora waved goodbye to Layla as Rosetta pulls her excitedly.
 
Somehow seeing Sora and Rosetta hold hands made her jealous. She regrets 
noticing her feelings for Sora just now. 
 
-At the airport-

&quot;Where the hell is Sora!? Our flight is soon!!!&quot;  May Wong screamed out

&quot;She said she would catch up. When Anna and me knocked at her door she 
was still not ready. She just woke up!&quot; said Mia

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be here any moment now. After all it&#39;s Ms. 
Layla&#39;s invitation. She won&#39;t miss it!&quot; pointed Anna

&quot;By the way, why did she wake up late? She knew that today is our 
flight.&quot; Sarah said as she put her arms around Carlos&#39;s. It was a bold 
move. It made Boss Carlos blush and started coughing as if signaling 
Sarah that &quot;Hey! It&#39;s embarrassing!&quot;. It made Sarah giggle in amusement 
and did not let go.

&quot;I&#39;ll go call her cell phone.&quot; Ken put out his cell phone and called 
Sora but no one was answering.

They all started to worry when they heard the announcement that it&#39;s 
time to go on board.

The none-talkative Leon suddenly volunteered to stay behind and wait for 
Sora. That made everyone suspicious but decided that someone should 
really wait for her but they never thought Leon would volunteer. Ken got 
irritated and stated the he too will wait for Sora.

 &quot;Is it just me or is it getting hot in here.&quot; stated May Wong

&quot;WE also feel the tension (sigh).&quot; Said all of them as they watched Leon 
and Ken stare each other with serious endeavor to say to each other, 
&quot;Stay away!&quot;

It took a few seconds of tension and finally ...&quot;Sora can take care of 
herself. She can catch the other flight in the afternoon. Let&#39;s go.&quot; 
said Boss Carlos commandingly. 
 
&quot;B...but Boss...!&quot; Both of the guys were not able to finish because of 
the sudden scary stare by Ms. Sarah. &quot;Do as you are told&quot;
 
&quot;huh.....Y... Yes ma&#39;am!&quot; Both guys saluted in fear. They knew that they 
shouldn&#39;t mess up with the all around karate kung fu etc. expert.
 
-at Kaleido Stage Dormitory-
 
&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! I&#39;m so late!!!!!!!! Oh no!!! I need this. I need 
that. What should I bring?!!&quot; Sora was in a panic. She wasn&#39;t able to 
pack early because of her busy schedule with Rosetta. &quot;Wait a minute... 
Where&#39;s Fool? I know he&#39;s a pain in the butt but I just can&#39;t leave him 
here alone. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s in my luggage beside my panties!&quot;
 
&quot;Fool!&quot; Sora was surprised Fool wasn&#39;t in her luggage. Maybe he&#39;s in 
Rosetta&#39;s she thought. 
 
She decided to leave and just kept in mind that fool was with Rosetta. 
Just after she locked her door and kept her keys, she heard a murmur... 
&quot;Sora... It&#39;s time for the final judgment. Come...&quot; 

&quot;What? Fool? Is that you?&quot; asked the brunette.

&quot;It&#39;s time for the final judgment... Come on stage...Sora Naegino... the 
brunette Kaleido Star...&quot;

&quot;Stage? What&#39;s happening Fool?&quot; asked the worried Sora. Fool did not 
answer anymore so she decided to go to the stage.
 
She was really worried about what fool said. &quot;Final judgment? What did 
he mean by that?&quot; She entered the stage and observed as she walked 
towards the center. No one was there.
 
&quot;Fool?! Where are you?!&quot; She called out.

Suddenly a bright light appeared beneath her feet. The whole stage was 
enveloped rapidly by darkness. The one that kept her sight clear is the 
light beneath her. She held her heart in fear. &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;
 
&quot;Are you scared... Sora?&quot; a familiar voice said. She turned around and 
was surprised to see her Father standing behind her.

&quot;Father? Why... why are you...&quot;

&quot;Are you scared Sora?&quot; another voice said. A woman suddenly appeared 
just beside her father.

&quot;Mother? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Sora was really puzzled with fear.

&quot;Come on Sora... Let&#39;s go home...&quot; Her father lift up his hand, 
signaling an invitation. 

&quot;but...&quot; Sora looked down sadly.

&quot;Yes... come with us... come home... You will never feel any pain if you 
with us now...&quot;

&quot;but... I... don&#39;t want to... I want to perform here... please 
understand.&quot;

&quot;but it hurts... right... Sora... People looking down on you... People 
leaving you ...and giving you a heavy burden with their dreams on your 
shoulders&quot; reasoned them.

&quot;Yes... I admit. That It hurts a lot but... but that&#39;s the reason I want 
to stay... It hurts but it makes mo happy to make them happy. That&#39;s the 
very reason why... why I chose to risk my life everyday... performing... 
practicing life threatening stunts! It gives me tremendous pleasure to 
see them, the people around me find hope with in me and my performance!&quot; 
She pointed her feelings dramatically that she shed tears as she was 
saying these lines.
 
After saying these, her father and mother disappeared without a trace. 
&quot;Where did they...&quot;she was interrupted by another familiar voice.
 
&quot;Sora... admit that you regret it...&quot; A familiar shape of a woman 
appeared in front of her.

&quot;Manami? You&#39;re here too...?&quot; Sora can&#39;t help wandering why they were 
here.

&quot;Sora...admit that you regret joining the Kaleido stage... regret that 
you left Japan...regret that you left your family that cared for you...&quot;

&quot;Why are you saying that Manami?&quot; Sora was in a state of shock because 
of these words.

&quot;Regret it!&quot; Exclaimed Manami

&quot;NO! I wont and I will never! I&#39;m glad that I chose to be here...! I&#39;m 
glad that I chose this hard road because this is the only way to it! 
There is no easy way towards your dream! I want this!&quot;
 
Right after Sora screamed out her point, Manami disappeared also without 
a trace. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Why do they appear and disappear just like 
that?&quot;

Sora&#39;s sweat dropped in fear. &quot;Fool!!!! Where are you?! What&#39;s going 
on?! What do you mean by final judgment?!&quot;
 
&quot;Sora...&quot; Sora was shocked to hear this voice. That voice belongs to the 
person she idolizes and truly cares for. 

&quot;Ms. Layla...?&quot;  She turned her head and met the eyes of that beloved 
person.

&quot;Sora... I have new dream now... I have a new partner now...&quot; Layla said 
tenderly.
 
Sora knew that and it hurts her... a lot. It hurts her that Ms. Layla is 
not her partner anymore. The Phoenix Reborn was fabulous... she wanted 
to perform with her forever. She tried hard to hide those tears...
 
&quot;Sora...&quot; Layla lifted Sora&#39;s face with her left hand. &quot;If you want 
me... to be with you... all you have to do is ask...&quot; Layla made 
eye-to-eye contact with her.

&quot;That&#39;s right... why shouldn&#39;t I ask her...? Why can&#39;t I say to her my 
true feelings? Am I scared? Am I scared to be rejected? I can&#39;t... say 
it... I can&#39;t ask her...&quot;As soon as Sora thought of this. The light 
beneath her started to fade slowly... and Layla slowly being covered by 
darkness. Sora started to get scared. She was scared that Layla might 
leave her alone in this darkness with only little light that was slowly 
fading away.

&quot;Say it Sora...&quot;

&quot;I...I... need you Ms.Layla! I want us to be together! I want us to 
perform together just like back then! Please stay! Don&#39;t leave me!&quot; she 
screamed with all her heart to express that inner passion.

&quot;That&#39;s all I want to hear...&quot; said Layla calmly.

Layla&#39;s image became sparkles. The light beneath Sora became brighter 
and spread throughout the whole dark enveloped stage. It was too bright. 
Sora covered her eyes. &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;
 
Suddenly a long blue crystal appeared before her.

&quot;Sora... you passed the final judgment... Take the crystal and embrace 
your destiny.&quot; Fool suddenly appeared behind her.

&quot;Fool? What&#39;s this? It feels warm...&quot; Sora&#39;s fear fade away as soon as 
she saw the blue crystal.

&quot;It is your crystal... Your gift... Your power...&quot;

&quot;Mine...?&quot; Sora was really fascinated by the crystal. She felt like it 
was calling her. She didn&#39;t understand what Fool meant by power but 
nevertheless, she touched the blue Crystal. A bright blue light started 
to envelope Sora like a robe. 
 
&quot;The crystal of the Blue Peaceful Dragon chose you as its rightful 
master... Your passion and love for the stage, your good, delicate heart 
fascinated the dragon! Behold! The Blue Dragon Kaleido Knight!&quot;
 
Sora and the crystal became one and the light that enveloped her 
transformed to an elegant armor...
