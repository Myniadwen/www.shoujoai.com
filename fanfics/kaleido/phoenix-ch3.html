<p><u>Note</u>: After looking at the fic I realized that my system needed some tweaking. By putting <em>Italic</em> text as thought it made it confusing to read. It was hard to tell where  overt subject started and invert subject began, so I decided to make  all thoughts in <strong><em>bold</em></strong> text and all emphasis or flashback in <em>Italic</em>. Thatas they say is that.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Sora finally snapped out of her daze when she realized just who she was laying on top of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god Layla I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; said Sora finally breaking the spell they were both in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora can I ask what your doing on top of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of an accident I slipped in a puddle trying to get your attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mission accomplished Sora, you have my attention, but if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind I would like to get up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  realized she was still on top of Layla. She got off of her apologizing  profusely. Sora noticed Layla&rsquo;s purse off to the side and went to pick  it up, unfortunately Layla went to do the same. There was an audible  thump when both heads collided with each other. Sora quickly started  rubbing the top of her forehead while Layla was rubbing near the bridge  of her nose. Both woman stopped their post collision recuperation and  stared at one another.</p>
<p>Normally Layla would have been angry over  such a careless accident but the apologetic look Sora gave her made her  do something she hadn&rsquo;t done for years. Layla Hamilton started  giggling, not the modest laugh a grown woman would give, but a chuckle  that would come from a little girl that saw her fist shooting star.  Maybe it was a physical release from the crazy day she had or maybe it  was the presence of Sora, who had talent in bringing out hidden parts  of herself.</p>
<p>Some of the people passing near by could have sworn  that this blonde headed woman had gone crazy. Sora might have agreed  with them. Seeing Layla laughing was one thing she hadn&rsquo;t gotten used  to and it never ceased to take her by surprise. The way Layla&rsquo;s eyes  sparkled and the way her entire body shook was like her whole purpose  was enjoying that mirthful moment. Sora couldn&rsquo;t help herself, seeing  Layla like that made her feel happy for reasons she couldn&rsquo;t explain  and she gave the Broadway star a million dollar smile.</p>
<p>Seeing  Sora smile at her like that with a bright blush on her face worked  wonders on sobering Layla up. Her recent erratic thoughts concerning  the Kaleido star where enough to make Layla self-conscious plus she  never liked people seeing an unprofessional side of herself, even when  it was Sora. It just seemed when Sora was around she had less control  over her emotions. Layla was starting to wonder if it was a good idea  to have Sora come here, but then one look at Sora&rsquo;s smile and Layla  suddenly could care less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should go, people are starting to stare.&rdquo; said Layla as she attempted to break the awkward moment.</p>
<p>Sora  took the hint, she could tell Layla was embarrassed over her  uncharacteristic display. &ldquo;Sure Layla, lets go pick up my bags and head  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two woman walked in an uncomfortable silence before the  blonde decided to break it up with some levity. &ldquo;I was beginning to  think you were mad at me for making you come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That comment puzzled Sora. &ldquo;Mad at you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  what with you tackling me and then trying to knock me unconscious.&rdquo;  Layla&rsquo;s jest got the intended response, Sora promptly blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>She is cute when she&rsquo;s flustered. Wait, did I just think that.&rdquo; </strong></em>It  was Layla&rsquo;s turn to blush and she looked away. Despite her errant  thoughts, Layla was starting to feel a little better. She didn&rsquo;t  realize just how fun teasing Sora was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Layla It really  wasn&rsquo;t my fault, not entirely anyway. I saw you through the crowd but I  couldn&rsquo;t get to you so I decided to go over them to get your attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  cleared all of those people on a jump just to get my attention. I must  say Sora, I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo; responded Layla as she turned to look at the  Japanese woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to lose you in the crowd, but  maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t take it to the extreme I did. My  landing was foiled by some water that was spilled on the floor and I  slipped, and you know what happens next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora finally claimed her suitcase off of the conveyer belt and both her and Layla headed out of the airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  cant believe someone was careless enough to leave their spilled drink  all over the floor, you lucky I was there to break your fall or you  could have been hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could think of much less pleasant  things to fall on.&rdquo; responded Sora on impulse before she could consider  what she was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Did Sora just flirt with me?&rdquo; </strong></em>thought a confused Layla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Did I just flirt with Layla?&rdquo; </strong></em>thought an equally confused Sora.</p>
<p>Finally  exiting the terminal both sighed in relief. The cool night air was  welcome after just being in an airport where both woman could have  sworn the temperature rose several degrees in the last couple of  seconds.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>From  inside the terminal a silver haired fairy watched with amusement. She  was sitting on an empty bottle of water near the spot where Layla and  Sora had their collision. &ldquo;Well then, that worked out better than I  expected.&rdquo; said the spirit of romance quite pleased with herself.</p>
<p>She never thought she would have gotten an answer to her rhetorical musings but a man&rsquo;s voice changed that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I sensed the queen of meddling near by, and I see your up to your same old tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion didn&rsquo;t need to turn around to know who spoke up. The only thing she said in response was one word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Fool  and Passion retreated to a realm only accessible to lesser fairies. It  was a void in reality bathed in a soft blue glow. Spirits would retreat  to this place when they needed to travel from one point to another but  the current occupants were there for some privacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing stalking my charge Passion?&rdquo; said an unamused Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know you were assigned to Layla?&rdquo; said the spirit of romance.  The woman that circled Fool in the eerie blue glow was not the same  woman Layla met that evening. Gone was the mischievous smile and lively  eyes. In it&rsquo;s place was a sorrow filled gaze and a demeanor was almost  timid.</p>
<p>Fool could see the hurt in her eyes but he cold care less.  For all the pain this retched spirit caused him in his life, he  considered himself generous by showing her as much civility as he did.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m not assigned to Layla, I was talking about Sora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora, the lilac haired Japanese woman?&rdquo; questioned Passion It was more a rhetorical statement than a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; was Fool simple reply</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I stepped into your territory but this Sora is the one I have to lead to Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me you&rsquo;ve been assigned to Layla, and that her and Sora are&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; interrupted Passion</p>
<p>Fool  was surprised, sure he knew something was going on between Layla and  Sora that exceeded mere friendship but her never thought that they  were&hellip;?</p>
<p>Fool&rsquo;s thoughts were cut short by the female spirit. &ldquo; I  just remembered something Fool, but wasn&rsquo;t the legendary maneuver  successfully performed and from what I&rsquo;ve heard, Sora has become the  true Kaleido star, so what are you still doing with Sora anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  the first time since they began to talk, Fool smiled. Not because he  was warming up to Passion but because of the circumstances. &ldquo;Actually  Sora&rsquo;s not in my care any longer&rdquo;</p>
<p>This clarification worried Passion. &ldquo;Fool please don&rsquo;t tell me your in lo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Fool quickly snapped,. He guessed the past was never truly forgotten if  that&rsquo;s what Passion was thinking. &ldquo;Sora has nothing to do with <em>her</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was like a slap to Passion&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, I was simply..&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumping  to conclusions.&rdquo; interrupted Fool. He didn&rsquo;t like how this conversation  was going so he decided to just leave it be. &ldquo;Look Passion that was a  long time ago and I&rsquo;ve changed. I am all about seeing worthy performers  succeed to stardom. I don&rsquo;t get involved anymore, I&rsquo;m strictly  business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said Sora became a true Kaleido star so why are you still following her?&rdquo; reasoned the spirit of romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I&rsquo;m not here on business I&rsquo;m here because I had some free time and  wanted to see how my friend Sora was doing on her vacation, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good friend Sora? I thought you said you said you don&rsquo;t get involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When its business I&rsquo;m all about the job but I&rsquo;m here on my own time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both  spirits were surprised just how easy they fell back on old  companionable ease. It was like the old days before their falling out.  Fool realized he should despise this woman but a civilized conversation  with someone not trying to tie you up or cram you into a confined space  was hard to come by these days and he couldn&rsquo;t help relaxing in the  silver haired woman&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;I was taking a break from my current  charge and decided to visit Sora, who I must say is always entertaining  on or off the stage, it was then I learned of this little trip and  decided to come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you heard of this little get together  and you followed her all the way here, in other words your stalking  her.&rdquo; said Passion jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not stalking her.&rdquo; said an irritated Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Why must all the woman I meet Lately be so insulting?&rdquo; </strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely read an interesting fortune that encouraged me to tag along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion  seemed quite interested now, Fool had an amazing ability to foretell  the future, one that would have been useful in her line of work, and  she was very interested in what might happen with her current  assignment. &ldquo;What was it monsieur, I would be most interested?</p>
<p>Not  wanting to make her job any easier but always wanting to show off, Fool  told her. &ldquo;To put it simply a trying time is ahead but if all goes well  the constellation of Leo and Sagittarius may share a position in the  night sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly what Passion was hoping for but it was promising none the less. &ldquo;Vague as always huh Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  future is never certain.&rdquo; said fool as he produced a circling ring of  tarot cards, after a few revolutions he stopped and chose one, when he  flipped it up the picture showed an upside-down medieval fortress. &ldquo;Ah  yes the inverted castle, old walls built to keep people out will began  to crumble. Hmm&hellip; interesting future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once Fool didn&rsquo;t know  what to make of his own fortune. When Fool decided to look up he  spotted the spirit of romance smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was, how do  they say, ah yes&hellip; cool, yes that was very cool monsieur.&rdquo; said an  entertained Passion. &ldquo;Its true you are the patron of entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing  praise always got Fool in a good mood. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Passion, that  little water trap you set up for Sora had me laughing harder than I can  remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if I don&rsquo;t watch out  fate might replace me.&rdquo; joked the spirit of the stage. &ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;ll get  your job, I bet being the spirit of romance you get to see some very  interesting things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo; the mischievous smile returned  but faded just as quickly. &ldquo;But I suspect with Layla as my charge I&rsquo;ll  be spending a lot of time locked in confining spaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool sympathized, oh how he sympathized. &ldquo;I feel your pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Perhaps Sora and Layla were truly meant for each other after all.&rdquo; </em></strong>mused Fool.</p>
<p>Laughing  and taking like this brought back some happy memories for Passion and  Fool, and they were happy they were able to spend time together. After  that was when Fool realized that maybe his fortune of the inverted  castle wasn&rsquo;t for Sora and Layla but for him and Passion. Maybe it was  time for the walls built between them to crumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a  proposition.&rdquo; started Passion, she realized what the fortune could mean  as well and she was willing to take that first step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; said Fool interested in what the silver haired woman had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t we call a truce and work together for old time sakes. You help me  push things along with Sora and I&rsquo;ll do the same for Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you saying I should be a temporary spirit of romance.&rdquo; mused Fool as he  imagined all the naughty things such a job would foretell.</p>
<p>Passion  knew what he was thinking and couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. &ldquo;In a way yes,  and it should be entertaining, isn&rsquo;t that what your all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persuasive  as always Passion&hellip;. I accept.&rdquo; with that said, Fool reached for  Passion&rsquo;s hand and kissed it, Passion returned the gesture with a  curtsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Just like old times.&rdquo; </strong></em>both spirits thought simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the show begin.&rdquo; said Fool as the spirits faded in a flash.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The  car ride was too quite. This wasn&rsquo;t the reunion Sora was hoping for.  The tension in the air was stifling and Sora couldn&rsquo;t help but blame  herself. Some of the things she did tonight embarrassed her more then  she would have liked in front of Layla. The brunette debated the  meaning of her relationship with the blonde for some time with no clear  answers, but after today she was starting to get some important insight.</p>
<p>Similar  thoughts ran through Layla head as she swerved in and out of traffic.  At the airport Layla felt like a totally different person. It seemed  Sora&rsquo;s presence had a stronger effect on her than she realized. In the  uncomfortable silence of the car, her mind wondered over the words  Passion said. <em>&ldquo;The person that sets her body aflame.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Layla  scoffed at that but tonight when Sora was on top of her she definitely  felt some heat, more heat than she could ever remember feeling. Did  that mean she was attracted to the Lilac haired Kaleido star. Layla  looked towards Sora by the corner of her eye. She noticed the skirt  Sora was wearing rode a little high on her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>She really does have nice legs.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought Layla but she quickly checked herself. <strong><em>&ldquo;Stop that.&rdquo; </em></strong>To keep herself away from unwanted thoughts she refocused on the road.</p>
<p>Sora  looked at Layla who for all appearances was very intent on her driving,  but she couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder why Layla&rsquo;s normally alabaster cheeks  were glowing red. Sora <em>thought</em> Layla was really focused on her  driving but when they nearly rear ended a Honda she had second  thoughts. The quiet was stifling and Sora, ever the entertainer decided  to engage the blonde in some conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are a nice set of wheels Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Layla finally snapping out her stupor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said this was a nice car.&rdquo; reiterated Sora now beginning to feel stupid at her choice of conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good car, Macquarie picked it out, it&rsquo;s a rental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macquarie  here?&rdquo; questioned Sora. After hearing Macquarie&rsquo;s name, her mood  dropped somewhat. After finding out Macquarie had such a long history  with Layla made thinking of the maid frustrating. Knowing the maid was  here with Layla in Boston irked her, but she figured Layla had her come  along. Being from the Hamilton family had to have its privileges and a  personal servant was always handy.</p>
<p>Layla was glad Sora tried to  engage her in some conversation but was disappointed when it abruptly  stopped after she mentioned Macquarie. <strong><em>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s jealous.&rdquo; </em></strong>That thought only improved her mood. &ldquo;<strong><em>Why do I want her to be jealous?&rdquo; </em></strong>Layla had so many question of late, but so few answers.</p>
<p>After  spending so much time apart from one another, both girls were eager to  see each other again, but now that they were together, neither knew how  to proceed. Fortunately for both of them a third party solved that  problem. A loud rumbling sound filled the car. At first Layla didn&rsquo;t  know what to make of it, but after she looked over at Sora who was ten  shades redder, she realized the sound came from the oriental girl&rsquo;s  stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; exclaimed Sora who&rsquo;s eyes were as wide as saucers.</p>
<p>For the second time tonight Layla bust out in a fit of girlish laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that funny.&rdquo; exclaimed the embarrassed brunette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  but it was completely adorable.&rdquo; said Layla as she suddenly stopped  laughing. She was shocked something like that came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Sora was shocked as well. To have Layla say that about her was unexpected. <strong><em>&ldquo;So Layla thinks I&rsquo;m adorable.&rdquo; </em></strong>knowing Layla felt that way about her made Sora giddy.</p>
<p>Layla  turned to Sora hoping the comment didn&rsquo;t upset her, but what she found  instead was Sora staring off into space with a warm smile plastered to  her face. <strong><em>&ldquo;So she likes being complemented by me.&rdquo; </em></strong>despite the blondes recent reservation she was happy to see Sora appreciated her complement.</p>
<p>Deciding  to just go with the flow, Layla started to feel much better. Thanks to  Sora&rsquo;s empty stomach, the awkward silence turned into a companionable  one. &ldquo;Sora would you like something to eat, I&rsquo;m sure I can get  Macquarie to make us something.&rdquo; at the mention of the maids name,  Sora&rsquo;s smile faded. &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to bother her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Maybe Sora really doesn&rsquo;t like Macquarie.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;How about I take you somewhere to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not necessary. I&rsquo;ll find someth&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please Sora I insist.&rdquo; interrupted Layla before the oriental girl could refuse.</p>
<p>After  hearing the blonde say please, Sora found she was powerless to refuse.  &ldquo;Ok Layla, I would that very much.&rdquo; said Sora in a low soft voice.</p>
<p>Hearing Sora&rsquo;s tone of voice gave Layla goose bumps. <strong><em>&ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s what she sound when she&rsquo;s aroused?&rdquo;</em></strong> Layla would have slapped herself for that if it didn&rsquo;t make her look  crazy. She didn&rsquo;t even want to start analyzing that thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So where are we going, I could go for a pizza or even a burger.&rdquo; mused Sora.</p>
<p>The  comment brought the blonde out of thoughts. &ldquo;I have a place in mind.&rdquo;  Layla remembered seeing a nice restaurant on the way to the airport.  Putting a little more gas to the car she took off in a hurry, obviously  forgetting her earlier run in with the law.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Having  hid in the backseat compartment, Fool and Passion watched with  interest. &ldquo;This seems to be unfolding nicely.&rdquo; said Passion with a  smile more fitting for a sinister Imp of misfortune than a benevolent  spirit of romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what is it you do exactly?&rdquo; questioned Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I create opportunities for love to flourish, after all the path to true love is paved with&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me guess, romance.&rdquo; interrupted Fool. &ldquo;That was corny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like your spooky gypsy routine is something to be proud over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know that I practice the art of sooth saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So says the sooth sayer.&rdquo; mocked Passion in a stage voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really cute.&rdquo; came Fool sarcastic reply.</p>
<p>Passion  didn&rsquo;t respond to that. She put her finger to her chin in thought when  something finally came to her. She slowly turned to Fool and  scrutinized him from head to toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Fool, not liking the look he was getting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are your acting skills oh spirit of the stage.&rdquo; said the sliver haired woman with her French accented tone.</p>
<p>There was an unsettling glimmer in Passion&rsquo;s eyes that could only mean trouble. &ldquo;Fine but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool  wasn&rsquo;t the only one who could do a trick or two. &ldquo;Lets just say people  want something more when they know others want to take it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion began laughing evilly and Fool began to wonder what he signed up for.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When  Layla&rsquo;s rental pulled into a small parking lot, Sora&rsquo;s eyes nearly  popped out of her head when she saw the place. The eating establishment  was beyond fancy. Looking at the expensive cars in the parking lot, the  Kaleido star knew the clientele the restaurant usually hosted was way  past her price range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layla we can&rsquo;t eat here.&rdquo; Sora didn&rsquo;t think she had enough money in her bank account to pay for appetizers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said a confused Layla.</p>
<p>Sora became sheepish. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to eat in a place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Sora it&rsquo;s on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t feel right, I couldn&rsquo;t take&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the one who asked you, so its my treat.&rdquo; reasoned the blonde trying to put Sora at ease. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That six letter word worked magically on Sora. &ldquo;Ok but next we go somewhere It&rsquo;s on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>She can be so stubborn. Its one of the many things I like about you Sora.&rdquo;</strong></em> thought Layla. &ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering  the restaurant was like stepping into a different world for Sora. High  society types where everywhere seated throughout the establishment, and  waiters moved like busy bees seeing to their every whims in hopes of  getting a generous tip.</p>
<p>Looking at everyone&rsquo;s attire made Sora  realize that she was sorely underdressed. Layla was wearing an  expensive spaghetti strap top with a matching black skirt that showed  off her perfect legs. The blondes fashion fit in perfectly here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>She really is beautiful. I&rsquo;m not even in the same league.&rdquo;</strong></em> thought Sora as she mentally berated herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m dressed right for this place Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  wondered why the brunette said that. She looked at Sora intently, she  was dressed in a cr&egrave;me colored short sleeve peasant top and skirt with  a thin white sweater over that. Radiant was the word Layla would use to  describe the lilac haired brunette. Sora&rsquo;s attire was filled out  perfectly by her fine tuned athletic body and Layla had to hide her  blush when she stared at Sora for too long. <strong><em>&ldquo;What does she mean by underdressed?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you look perfect Sora.&rdquo; Layla had to be honest and she was happy to see Sora visibly relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>If that is what Layla thinks then to hell with everybody else.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought a content Sora. &ldquo;Shall we then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two woman approached a very snooty looking host. Sora let Layla do the  talking, it was her type of place after all. &ldquo;We would like a table for  two please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry madam but on such short notice we cant  find you a table right away, if you would like to wait at the bar until  one come open I&rsquo;m sure everything will be work out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be fine.&rdquo; with that the host showed them to the bar and left them quickly.</p>
<p>Looking  around the two woman spotted two empty seats and sat down. The  bartender came and asked for their drinks, both not really thirsty  declined.</p>
<p>Sora noticed the bar was like a scene from a James Bond  movie. High priced suits and scantily clad woman were everywhere, this  wasn&rsquo;t the kind of place Sora enjoyed to go. Layla noticed this and  sympathized with Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I hope we get a table soon.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me is this seat taken?&rdquo; said a rakishly handsome man in an Armani suit. He was pointing at the vacant seat next to Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please go ahead.&rdquo; said Sora not wanting to be impolite.</p>
<p>The man happily sat down, and stared at Sora. Layla noticed this and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I&rsquo;m not jealous.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought Layla trying to convince herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Fredrick, may I ask what your name is?&rdquo; said the man with a shiny smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes my name is Sora and this is&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora, what a beautiful name, Japanese right?&rdquo; interrupted Fredrick, not caring to know who the blonde was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I..&rdquo; Started Sora but the man pushed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  nice, I couldn&rsquo;t help notice you were alone so how about I buy you a  drink and we get to know one another.&rdquo; insisted Fredrick. He was now  wearing a creepish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not alon&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what would you like?&rdquo; interrupted the man again waving over the bartender.</p>
<p>This  Fredrick instantly got on Layla&rsquo;s nerves. The way the man was staring  at Sora was like a person picking out their favorite cuts of meat, plus  he was just plain rude. <strong><em>&ldquo;I know your type, if you think I&rsquo;m going to let you bother Sora, your wrong.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me but I think we would rather be alone.&rdquo; said Layla for the first time since the man sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  excused, me and &hellip; Sora was it, yes me and Sora were having a  conversation.&rdquo; said the man barely recognizing Layla presence.</p>
<p>Layla was furious at his audacity. The former Kaleido star was a few second&rsquo;s away from breaking his neck.</p>
<p>Sora didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it, this man was beyond persistent and he was openly rude to Layla. <strong><em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unforgivable.&rdquo; </em></strong>thought Sora now growing visibly upset.</p>
<p>Layla saw this and thought it was best to leave the jerk and go. Layla got up and held out her hand. &ldquo;Come on Sora lets go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing  the out stretched hand Sora didn&rsquo;t hesitate to take it, when her hand  enclosed around Sora&rsquo;s a jolt of electricity past through them that  made them forget the annoying man for a second.</p>
<p>When Sora rose to  leave the man stopped her movements with a firm clasp over her left  arm. &ldquo;Woah where do you think your going, we aren&rsquo;t done talking yet.&rdquo;  said the man, his smile now gone and in its place was a sinister smirk.</p>
<p>Layla lost all traces of civility. <strong><em>&ldquo;How dare he touch her.&rdquo; </em></strong>fumed the blonde, but before she could make a move the Kaleido star beat her to it.</p>
<p>Sora  reached over with a well aimed knee to the groin that loosened the hold  he had on her arm. Her bold move shocked Layla as well as her self. All  she knew was Fredrick&rsquo;s touch made her hair stand on her head.</p>
<p>Recovering from the shock Layla pulled on Sora hand and together they left the restaurant.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Fredrick  limped out into the back alley. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Sora hit him, sure  he was persistent but why there of all places. He was about to check if  he could still father kids when a side splitting laugh sounded out  behind him. Fredric turned around and gave the sliver haired woman a  sincere look of displeasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your having fun Passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was so perfect, I will cherish this memory for eternity.&rdquo; Said Passion who was still in a fit of chuckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad my pain amuses you now can you please turn me back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine  but I must say that look is very becoming.&rdquo; joked Passion, deciding to  get down to business, a glow engulfed the spirits body and with a  flourish of Passion&rsquo;s hand the man known as Fredrick cease to exist,  and in its place stood a funny walking Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it still hurt?&rdquo; asked an unsympathetic spirit of romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; deadpanned Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est  la vie.&rdquo; returned the spirit finally getting her laughter under  control. &ldquo;You should congratulate yourself on a great performance, you  give your title credence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you but what does pissing them off have to do with romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the face of common diversity, two soul are brought closer together.&rdquo;  said Passion twirling in a circle and then doing a curtsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was corny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It  took several minutes before the two woman calmed down, and it was  several more minutes until they realized they were walking in the  opposite direction as their car. Neither realized the whole time they  were still holding hands. People passing by thought they looked like a  cute couple, what with it being Boston and all.</p>
<p>Sora knew they  were still holding hand, and she should have let go but something about  it made her feel comfortable and after the episode in the restaurant  she could use a little comfort.</p>
<p>Sora&rsquo;s thoughts were almost identical to Layla&rsquo;s. &ldquo;<strong><em>I  know I should let go, but this feels so nice. Good friends hold hands  don&rsquo;t they, but I never had a friend close enough before to try.&rdquo;</em></strong> thought Layla as she looked at the brunette beside her. <strong><em>&ldquo;Maybe I do now.&rdquo; </em></strong>finished the blonde with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for ruining our dinner Layla.&rdquo; spoke up Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ruin our dinner, that jerk did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I attacked him and made a scene.&rdquo; lamented the brunette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he got what he deserved.&rdquo; reasoned Layla with a smile and a small squeeze of their hand.</p>
<p>Sora  was grateful for the blondes understanding. They both continued in a  silent walk that could easily be seen as a couple strolling along  enjoying the sights. The quiet moment was broken by the rumbling of a  stomach, but this time it wasn&rsquo;t Sora&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I forgot to eat before going to the airport.&rdquo; apologized the blonde whose face became cherry colored.</p>
<p>Right  then some neon lights caught Sora eye. &ldquo;Come on I have some place I  want to go.&rdquo; said the brunette as she pulled a curious blonde along  with her.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One large with everything on it.&rdquo; said Sora to a man wearing a chef&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>Layla leaned over to Sora. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like mushrooms.&rdquo; whispered the blonde.</p>
<p>Having  Layla&rsquo;s breath crash against her ear caused a tingle of excitement to  go down Sora&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;Could you please hold the mushrooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One large pizza with everything but mushrooms coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora reached into her purse and produced the money for the pizza, but Layla saw this and went to intercept. &ldquo;No Sora let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggested the place so its on me.&rdquo; said Sora using Layla&rsquo;s earlier words against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok but next&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its on you.&rdquo; said Sora with a wink as she reached over and paid for the food and drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  will be done in a minute, here is your ticket, please have a seat I&rsquo;ll  bring it to you shortly.&rdquo; finished the friendly cashier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; said the two woman at the same time.</p>
<p>Sora  led them to a booth and they took a seat across from each other on the  benches. This was more Sora&rsquo;s environment and it showed on her relaxed  demeanor. Layla on the other hand was a different story. Where as Sora  was underdressed for the restaurant, Layla was overdressed for this  small pizza parlor where most people had on blue jeans and T-shirts.</p>
<p>Layla  would never show that she was feeling awkward instead she was acted  nonchalant with a rigid posture. This didn&rsquo;t fool Sora who spent time  living with Layla. She knew when the other woman got like that she was  embarrassed. &ldquo;Relax Layla, there are people here to eat and enjoy  themselves they don&rsquo;t care what people are wearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla smiled  and relaxed, she forgot how good Sora became at reading her feelings.  &ldquo;Your right I&rsquo;m just a little self-conscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments  past. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait, I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo; said Sora as she leaned back and  rubbed her stomach. &ldquo;Poor baby, mama&rsquo;s going to make it all better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  other woman&rsquo;s antics struck a cord in Layla and she started giggling.  With Sora that was happening a lot lately and she was starting to  really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Sora was glad she got the intended reaction.  Making people smile was truly her joy in life, and making Layla smile  and laugh felt like winning the lottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here your pizza, you two ladies enjoy said the cashier as he put the pizza on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arigato.&rdquo; said Sora as she wasted no time in digging in.</p>
<p>Both  girls sat there eating for a moment when the brunette decided to gauge  the reason for her visit. &ldquo;So Layla why did you want me to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  took her time in answering and when she spoke up she gave Sora her full  attention. Most of the reasons for doing the operation rested heavily  on how Sora reacted to the news and she didn&rsquo;t want the brunette to be  threatened about her returning to the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora awhile back I  read an article in the newspaper about a doctor experimenting with  revolutionary new surgery regarding bone and ligament injuries. I  didn&rsquo;t know if it could help me but I wanted to hope it could. I had my  doctor send my medical information to the specialist&rsquo;s office to see if  there was a chance. I held my hope for a long time until I was  contacted about it several days ago. I met here in Boston and the  doctor told me.. well she told me that it was possible that my injury  could recover and I could get the full use of my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before  Layla could finish the unexpected happened. She knew Sora was athletic  on a level few could compare to but she couldn&rsquo;t believe Sora could get  up, walk around, and then slide into her booth seat and give her a bone  crushing hug, in no more than half a second . The move was surprising  but welcomed. Layla didn&rsquo;t know having someone so supportive of her  felt so good. <strong><em>&ldquo;Maybe relying on someone isn&rsquo;t a bad thing after all.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so happy for you Layla. This means we are going to partners again  right?&rdquo; said Sora as she moved back and stared Layla straight in the  eye.</p>
<p>Having Sora so close and practically holding her did wonder  to Layla body. Instead of becoming confused or flustered she decided  just this once she was going to enjoy it. &ldquo;I hope so Sora. I miss  Kaleido stage more than I could ever dream but I miss being on stage  with you the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora was so happy she was in near tears.  Their little display was causing a few stares so Sora released Layla  but remained seated next to her. &ldquo;So when is the operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days from now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days!&rdquo; said a surprised Sora. &ldquo;Is it dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes  it is and that&rsquo;s why I needed you here.&rdquo; Layla became rather  embarrassed for the next part. &ldquo;I called you because I needed someone  to be here for me during and after the operation. I&rsquo;m not very good at  relying on other people and you&rsquo;re the only person I truly trust. I  called you here hoping you would help. I couldn&rsquo;t ask this over the  phone, it was something I needed to do personally. Its asking a lot of  you Sora, it takes several days post op if everything goes smoothly and  then it take months of physical therapy to get my shoulder back to  normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora stopped Layla by grabbing a hold of her hand. &ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; gasped Layla, that wasn&rsquo;t the response she was hoping for.</p>
<p>Sora  merely smiled. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to ask Layla, of course I&rsquo;ll do  anything to help. I want to be there for you no matter what it is, I  thought you already knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Layla didn&rsquo;t know what to  say. Having Sora&rsquo;s answer was like picking a thousand pounds off of her  chest. She was in awe at the woman in front of her, never had Layla met  a woman quite like her.</p>
<p>Sora was hoping that Layla would grace  her a smile or maybe even a thank you, but what happened took her by  surprise. Tears began falling from Layla&rsquo;s eyes and she pulled Sora  against her in a warm hug. The two woman shared a moment between them,  they were getting looks from the other patrons but neither cared. The  future looked bright and they were both happy thinking of good times  ahead.</p>
<p>Both woman didn&rsquo;t know how long they stayed that way but their ice melted drinks and cold pizza told them it was time to go.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>They  returned to the car and headed to the hotel barely saying more than two  words the entire trip. Everything was out in the open and they sat back  and enjoyed the company of one another.</p>
<p>When they walked into the hotel it was very late and they proceeded to the elevator toting Sora&rsquo;s luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I booked your room next to mine if you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; said Layla as the elevator began to ascend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure its nice.&rdquo; said the brunette giving Layla a warm smile.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the intended floor they walked toward their rooms deep in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I&rsquo;m  beginning to understand just what Layla means to me now. All the pieces  are falling in place, I just hope Layla can feel the same way&rdquo; </strong></em>thought Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Maybe  the reasons behind feeling these things for Sora are much simpler than  I thought. Sora&rsquo;s always been different than anyone I have ever met,  even the first time I saw her I felt something different about her. I  wonder if Sora ever felt the same&rdquo; </strong></em>mused Layla.</p>
<p>Arriving at the door, Layla broke the silence. &ldquo;I bet your tired after your long flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  be honest the flight wasn&rsquo;t that long at all. They bumped me up to  first class so I got to fly in style. It was great, they treated me  like a queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of Sora being royalty amused Layla.  &ldquo;Really? I thought you would be used to the royal treatment by now,  what with you being the Kaleido star and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really Layla,  you were the only queen of Kaleido stage, Kalos goes out of his way to  star a lot of performers so everyone&rsquo;s treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you saying I was high maintenance?&rdquo; joked Layla with a straight face, but Sora thought she was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not what I meant at all.&rdquo; said Sora, worried that she might have  insulted Layla. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just you were such a powerful presence on stage  and the way you carried yourself there was really majestic but now that  your gone its just me and I&rsquo;ll never come close to you Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was kidding Sora.&rdquo; said Layla when the lavender haired woman had to  take a breath. She then got Sora attention and looked her straight in  the eye. &ldquo;I agree with you Sora. I don&rsquo;t think you come close to me.&rdquo;  before Sora could respond she continued. &ldquo;I think you surpassed me a  long time ago. I don&rsquo;t just mean performing Sora, I&rsquo;m talking about  what it is you bring to Kaleido stage. When your around you bring out a  special part of everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing out a special part of everyone?&rdquo; asked an intrigued Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  When your around people they remember that little voice they had when  they were kids. That voice that said they wanted to be someone special  someday. It&rsquo;s a voice that unfortunately fades as time goes by and  people forget who they <em>wanted</em> to be in favor of someone they think they <em>should</em> be. And that&rsquo;s your power Sora, you make people remember those dreams  and give them the spirit to fight and realize them once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  eyes glistened in the light. Layla words were spoken so passionately  she knew that Layla believed every word. She never knew anyone felt  that way about her, and she never thought her presence had that kind of  effect on anyone&rsquo;s life. Normally she would be embarrassed if someone  said these kind of thing about her, but coming from Layla it made her  heart flutter.</p>
<p>Layla sensed a sort of calm settle over Sora who  stood there staring at her without saying word. She couldn&rsquo;t believe  the day she was having. Layla wondered where she found the nerve to  tell Sora these type of things and she wondered if she went too far.</p>
<p>It was quiet between them when Sora decided to break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dream?&rdquo; said the lavender haired Kaleido star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dream?&rdquo; returned Layla confused at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the dream I helped you realize?&rdquo; asked a quiet Sora who took a step closer to Layla.</p>
<p>The  blonde was curious as to why Sora was coming closer but she decided to  answer honestly. &ldquo;For me it wasn&rsquo;t a dream that you helped me remember  but rather the dreamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layla I&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me finish.&rdquo;  interrupted Layla. It was like opening a flood gate and it felt too  good to stop. &ldquo;Because of you I can remember how to cry, laugh, and  dream of a better tomorrow. Because of you I realized that performing  wasn&rsquo;t about being the star at all. It was about the crowd with their  smiling faces and doing your best to make people happy. Just like I was  when I saw a show for the first time.&rdquo; after this it was Layla&rsquo;s turn  to take a step towards Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m saying Sora is that you  unlocked a part of me that I thought died with my mother and because of  that you turned me from an unbeliever to a dreamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After  hearing this Sora took the final step closer and now they were no more  then few centimeters apart. A part of Layla wanted to put some distance  between them but an even larger part wanted to remove what was left.  Sora face was so close she could feel her breath tickling her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  really glad I met you.&rdquo; whispered Layla as she boldly reached up and  put her palm against Sora&rsquo;s cheek. The blonde didn&rsquo;t even notice that  her thumb automatically started caressing the skin under it.</p>
<p>Sora  mind was in a haze. Being so near Layla&rsquo;s warm body and smelling her  expensive perfume already caused her head to swim, but having the  blonde caress her face was overkill. A rare feeling took control of  Sora&rsquo;s body that she identified right away as desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layla.&rdquo; was all Sora whispered as she closed her eyes and leaned into the touch.</p>
<p>Layla  had a reputation for being an ice queen, one she admitted was quite  accurate, but when Sora closed her eyes and rubbed her cheek into  Layla&rsquo;s palm, a fire ignited inside of her that melted the ice.</p>
<p>Sora  was reluctant to look at the blonde&rsquo;s face. She had never physically  been this bold with anyone in her life and was afraid to see her  advances rejected, but when she finally opened her eyes she was shocked  to see that her desire was being mirrored by Layla&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Everything  was happening way too fast but both woman had neither the will or the  desire to stop. When the heat between them reached the boiling point,  Layla took the initiative by using her hand on Sora&rsquo;s cheek to bring  their faces closer together. Their gazes spoke volumes and an unspoken  agreement passed between. With mingled breaths the two woman closed  their eyes and leaned in for the inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Te be continued</strong>. Growing up I always hated annoying cliffhangers but here I am giving you the same crap, but I have to admit its fun.</p>
