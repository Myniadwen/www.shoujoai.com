<p>This  is a short update but there is more to come. In the next chapters I&rsquo;ll  be doing more character side stories like I did with Manami and Ken.  It&rsquo;s my goal to give all the Kaleido favorites a little screen time, or  word time so to speak. Anna, Mia, Rosetta, May, and what the heck maybe  even Jonathan but you get the point. Also blame the shorter than usual  update on my Fan art making hobby that consumed alot of my time, so  take a look when your done reading the chapter, its how I visualized  the ending.The picture is at my deviantart account that&rsquo;s linked as my  homepage on author profile. That as they say is that.</p>
<p>Thoughts are <strong><em>Bold </em></strong>and enfaces and flashbacks are <em>Italic</em>.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Sora  shot up in her bed, or what she thought was her bed. When she finally  became fully awake she noticed she was sleeping in a sofa and this  wasn&rsquo;t even her hotel room. The morning sun bathed the main room in a  bright blinding light and Sora looked around to get a grasp of her  surroundings but it made her wish she didn&rsquo;t. The brunette&rsquo;s head was  pounding and the whole world was spinning. &ldquo;This must be what a  hangover feels like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a minute to figure out how she got there. <strong><em>&ldquo;I remember the caf&eacute;, our walk, and the night club&hellip;&rdquo; </em></strong>Sora&rsquo;s mind came to screeching halt. <strong><em>&ldquo;The dance&hellip;. then after the dance&hellip;.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no!&rdquo; Sora shook her head to make sure she wasn&rsquo;t still dreaming. When  she realized she was wide awake and the events of the previous night  took place, she only had one course of action. &ldquo;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scream was so loud that it startled Fool from his sleeping spot on the  couch&rsquo;s back rest. The spirit&rsquo;s tumble landed him right on top of  Sora&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;What? Did someone get murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Sora a minute to acknowledge Fool&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  else?&rdquo; said Fool as he picked himself up and gave the brunette a sour  look for spoiling his pleasant nap. &ldquo;Why were you screaming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora grabbed Fool and held him at eye level. &ldquo;What happened last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From  what I could see you had a lot of fun.&rdquo; the spirit smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never  seen Layla blush so much before, and here I always thought she was made  of ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; said the brunette as she fell back on the sofa and let out a groan of frustration.</p>
<p>After  being freed from her grip the spirit of the stage hovered near Sora&rsquo;s  head and gave her a sympathetic look. &ldquo;I know your feeling sorry about  tying me up and leaving me at the mercy of a killer pigeon but cheer up  because I already forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that, I was  talking about what I did last night to Layla.&rdquo; The brunette remembered  everything with shocking clarity and she couldn&rsquo;t believe she did the  things she did. The image of her kissing Layla passionately flashed in  her mind and it caused the blood to rise to her face. Sora reached up  and touched her lips. She remembered how it felt, the warmth, the  softness, and above all else the intensity. It felt like an animal that  was living inside of her was released and it practically mauled the  woman she cared for. The foundling and the groping was one thing but it  made her shiver to think about how far it would have gone had she not  fallen asleep. Her primal actions last night were inexcusable and she  never thought she had so little control over her body. &ldquo;That was me and  not some doppelganger right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool wanted to make Sora feel  better by telling her the truth but he cared more about himself at the  moment and he knew once he told her everything then there would be hell  to pay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so but look on the bright side, you made a lasting  impression on Layla and now she knows exactly how you feel about her.&rdquo;  Fool didn&rsquo;t get a response so he tried some levity. &ldquo;Shame she knows  the truth about you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What truth?&rdquo; answered Sora after Fool got her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re a sex starved deviant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny.&rdquo; the brunette sighed. &ldquo;Maybe your right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop  with the melodrama already.&rdquo; Fool floated in front the girl to give her  one of his all knowing looks. &ldquo;Ask yourself this, was Layla upset over  your actions or did she return them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that Sora thought about it, Layla did seem to return her advances. <strong><em>&ldquo;Which means she might have done&hellip;that&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>Fool saw that his point sunk in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry anymore, she obviously liked it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem, I don&rsquo;t want her to get the wrong impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After  last night Layla probably thinks I want to do&hellip;that, and I&rsquo;m certainly  not ready to go there. After the way I acted I don&rsquo;t blame her for  thinking I&rsquo;m a slut or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit knew Layla had the  whole story but he wondered how he was going to get Sora to let it go.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s just as guilty of what happened last night as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last  night I think you two just got worked up on the dance floor among other  things. You were ensnared by the moment and lost control, it&rsquo;s a common  mistake made by those engaged in a new romance. She probably isn&rsquo;t  ready to take that step anymore than you are and I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t  think any less of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora was skeptical. &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo; Fool&rsquo;s resolve face left no room for arguments. &ldquo;You should  just count yourself lucky that you to didn&rsquo;t ruin what you started to  build. I&rsquo;m sure Layla woke up this morning thanking the deities that  you passed out before she did something she wasn&rsquo;t ready for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora smiled. &ldquo;I hate to admit this but maybe your right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit looked smug. &ldquo;I always am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; the brunette did a quick scan of the room. &ldquo;If this is Layla&rsquo;s room where is she?.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Fool shrugged. &ldquo;I woke up the same time you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brunette got up from the couch and walked to the open bedroom door but she stopped right before she entered. <strong><em>&ldquo;What if I wake her up, and do I really want to see her after what I did last night.&rdquo;</em></strong> with that thought in mind, Sora turned around and started tip toeing towards the door.</p>
<p>Fool  watched his charge&rsquo;s antics with annoyance. &ldquo;Oh for the love of fate.&rdquo;  the sprit floated into the bedroom only to return five seconds later.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora looked back at Fool. &ldquo;What do you mean  she&rsquo;s not there, it&rsquo;s early in the morning where else would she be.&rdquo; an  unnerving thought entered Sora&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Do you think she wanted to  avoid me so she took off, I bet she even went to Macquarie&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; she  couldn&rsquo;t help but say that last part with annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, I sure there is a logical explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like  what?&rdquo; demanded Sora timidly. &ldquo;I bet she got freaked over last night. I  know I would have been freaked and I was the one doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could be anywher&hellip;&rdquo; said Fool but he stopped in mid sentence as a smell hit his nostrils.</p>
<p>Sora was curious as to what Fool was smelling until she noticed it too. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit shrugged.</p>
<p>The  brunette didn&rsquo;t waste any time investigating. She noticed the closer  she got to the kitchenette the stronger the smell got. It didn&rsquo;t take  her long to identify the source. There sitting in the small sink was a  pan with a large amount of charcoaled layering. Whatever it used to be  she couldn&rsquo;t say but now it looked like an alien experiment gone bad.  &ldquo;I think we should get the government to classify this, it definitely  proves the existence of extraterrestrials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool smirked. &ldquo;Funny.&rdquo; his smile died as he took a good look at it. &ldquo;Maybe your right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two were so engrossed in their examination of the other worldly goo  that they missed the hotel door opening. Sora was about to make another  comment but she was interrupted by a harsh demanding voice. &ldquo;What are  you doing in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Macquarie  was sitting on her room sofa looking out at the window to the city. Her  world fell apart yesterday and she didn&rsquo;t know what she was going to  do. She had always tried to be patient with her feelings and allow  Layla to realize how she felt about her, but after witnessing her  mistress kiss that Kaleido star in broad public, she knew she missed  her chance.</p>
<p>Macquarie looked over at her packed suitcases. She  booked a flight back to New York and it was almost time for her to go.  Layla might have become distant from the Broadway stage but it was  actually something that Macquarie enjoyed to do. The producers were  putting up a new show that Layla had already turned down. One of them  saw Macquarie&rsquo;s performance during &lsquo;The Phoenix&rsquo; so they wanted to  offer her the part. It was something she hadn&rsquo;t told Layla because she  knew her mistress would insist she go, but leaving was something that  the maid couldn&rsquo;t do. Macquarie had made a choice to always stay by  Layla&rsquo;s side and all the fame and fortune of showbiz couldn&rsquo;t make her  waver from that decision. That was until Sora came back into her  mistress&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>In just a single day she felt like giving up and  distancing herself from the pain that overtook her heart. Macquarie  couldn&rsquo;t compete with Sora when it came to Layla&rsquo;s love and she knew  it. <strong><em>&ldquo;A new life&hellip; I could start a new life and all I&rsquo;d have to do  is get on that plane and I wouldn&rsquo;t ever have to see Sora Naegino  again.&rdquo;</em></strong> a tear slid down Macquarie&rsquo;s face. <strong><em>&ldquo;But that also means I wouldn&rsquo;t ever see Layla again.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Macquarie  looked at her watch and noticed it was time to leave or she would miss  her flight. She got up and grabbed her suitcases and headed for the  door. Macquarie stopped dead in her tracks before she could leave. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; said the girl as she fell to her knees and began crying. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t give up, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Layla can&rsquo;t be happy with that  woman. She belongs to me and that&rsquo;s how it was meant to be. I can&rsquo;t let  this continue, I have to find a way to stop this.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>Her  cell phone chose this moment to start ringing. It startled her at  first, it was almost like an answer to her selfish prayer. She gave  herself two rings to compose herself before she answered. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Macquarie is that you?&rdquo; </em>came a gentleman&rsquo;s voice on the other line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hamilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Good,  I finally got a hold of someone. I&rsquo;ve been trying to contact Layla but  her cell phone must be broken. I was worried sick that something  happened to her. She is all right isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Macquarie nodded even though no one could see her. &ldquo;Yes, she seems to be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Nothings wrong with her?&rdquo; </em>asked Mr. Hamilton.</p>
<p>Macquarie  noticed his excited tone was gone now. His voice now took on a low calm  tone. &ldquo;Yes Mr. Hamilton, there is nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no  answer on the other line for several moments and Macquarie thought that  Layla&rsquo;s father had hung up, but Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s voice did come through  once again and this time it sounded furious. <em>&ldquo;If there is nothing wrong then what the hell happened to the contract meeting with Mr. Bracken yesterday?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The maid sighed. &ldquo;Mistress Layla had other arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Other arrangements?&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Anytime  Macquarie was ever asked about Layla&rsquo;s personal affairs she usually  feigned ignorance but a wicked thought burned in her mind. <strong><em>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t have to do anything to get what I want.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s my place to say Mr. Hamilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What is it Macquarie?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter has been acting very strange lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Strange&hellip; strange how?&rdquo; </em>asked the concerned father.</p>
<p>Macquarie  got a sick feeling in her stomach for what she was about to do.  Macquarie looked down at her suitcase and realized that she wasn&rsquo;t  ready to start a new life when she hadn&rsquo;t given up on the old one yet.  &ldquo;Layla is behaving in ways I know you wouldn&rsquo;t approve of and it all  started when Sora came here to visit&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Sora  was startled by the new arrival. When she turned around she found a  very embarrassed looking blonde staring at her with two bags in her  hand. &ldquo;Layla, you startled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but you shouldn&rsquo;t have  seen this.&rdquo; It was clear she was talking about the black substance that  enthralled the smaller girl earlier.</p>
<p>Sora&rsquo;s eyes wandered over to the gunk in question. &ldquo;Layla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla looked everywhere but at Sora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your breakfast.&rdquo; said the blonde in a low voice that was barely audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&hellip;b&hellip;b&hellip;  breakfast.&rdquo; The idea of that stuff being compared to something that was  eaten was shocking to say the least. &ldquo;That used to be food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  blonde sighed. &ldquo;This morning you were out cold and I thought it would  be nice if you woke up to a nice breakfast. Macquarie had stocked the  fridge so I decided to try my hand at cooking but it didn&rsquo;t turn out so  well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Understatement of the century.&rdquo; </strong></em>Sora smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gesture that counts.&rdquo; the girl pointed to the bag in Layla&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After  the hotel safety manager declared that everything was safe I went and  got you food from the restaurant across the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nice of you Layla.&rdquo; Sora said before she did a double take. &ldquo;What do you mean safety manager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  set the food down on the counter. &ldquo;The smoke triggered the alarm and he  came up to see if we needed to call the fire department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  the blonde went about getting the food out of the bag, Sora wondered  exactly what happened this morning. &ldquo;There was an alarm and people  running around the room and I slept through the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  blonde nodded. &ldquo;You were completely out of it. I think an atomic bomb  could have gone off and you&rsquo;d still be asleep.&rdquo; Layla cringed when she  realized that kind of joke probably wasn&rsquo;t very funny to someone of  Sora&rsquo;s nationality.</p>
<p>The brunette didn&rsquo;t seem to care. &ldquo;I just  can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t wake up, last night must of really took a lot  out of me.&rdquo; having said that, Sora remembered exactly what happened  last night. A sudden wave of anxiety washed over the Kaleido star. Her  face began glowing red and she turned away from Layla to avoid the  other woman&rsquo;s eyes. If she saw even a hint of regret in Layla&rsquo;s bright  blue orbs she knew she would be crushed. The wonderful feeling that  resided in her heart since she came here was something that was  precious to her, and Sora was afraid after the way she acted last night  that this would be the end.</p>
<p>Sora wasn&rsquo;t the only one that found  it hard to look the other in the eye. Layla was laying out the food she  bought with her back turned to the smaller girl. She was feeling an  enormous amount of guilt over last night. The blonde couldn&rsquo;t help but  feel like she took advantage of Sora. She might have gone all the way  if Passion hadn&rsquo;t told her about the potion and doing that with Sora  when the other woman wasn&rsquo;t in full control of her own actions made it  feel like a violation of everything they had together.</p>
<p>Sora was  drowning in a sea of her own insecurities. She didn&rsquo;t want to deal with  the rejection right now so she figured the best option was a fast  break. &ldquo;I thinks it&rsquo;s best if I go to my room right now.&rdquo; said the  brunette has she headed for the door without ever looking back at.</p>
<p>The  brunette was already out the door when Layla finally snapped out of her  stupor. &ldquo;Sora?&rdquo; Layla called out but it was useless, the other woman  was already gone. Layla looked at the uneaten breakfast that she set  out. &ldquo;Dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion, who watched the whole thing, shook her head  and decided to ignore Layla&rsquo;s earlier warning about staying quiet for  the rest of the day. &ldquo;Are you happy now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blonde sat down on  the stool lining the kitchenette&rsquo;s counter. &ldquo;Of course not but she&rsquo;s  obviously regretted this whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your weren&rsquo;t so self-absorbed you might have seen that she was worried that you were the one who regretted things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she now that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if she recalled what happened between us last night then she remembered I didn&rsquo;t exactly turn her down.&rdquo; reasoned Layla.</p>
<p>The  spirit of romance let out a sigh of frustration. &ldquo;Self-doubts cloud all  reason so if you don&rsquo;t get off your ass and go after her I will  personally call upon all my power to make your life a living hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blonde was shocked at Passion&rsquo;s harsh attitude. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  just need you to take a chapter from the book of Sora, if you want  something bad enough then give your everything to make it happen. I  know this is all new to you and your allowed your share of hesitation  but right now there&rsquo;s a chance that you two could mess this up and  it&rsquo;ll all be my fault.&rdquo; the spirit choked back a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passion?&rdquo; asked a concerned Layla. She didn&rsquo;t know her guiding spirit took her mess up that strongly.</p>
<p>The  silver haired woman turned around so she didn&rsquo;t have to look Layla in  the eye. &ldquo;Please make this better Layla. I can&rsquo;t be the cause of  messing up your romance. You don&rsquo;t know what would happen to me if I  failed you two.&rdquo; this time Passion did sob and made Layla feel lousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please  don&rsquo;t cry, I&rsquo;ll fix this you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; making good on her words, Layla  quickly packed up the breakfast and headed out the door as fast as she  could.</p>
<p>When Layla was out of sight, Passion fell over laughing. &ldquo;I never thought she was that gullible.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When  Layla got to Sora&rsquo;s room she knocked on it gently. &ldquo;Sora?..Sora if your  in there I need to talk to you.&rdquo; Layla waited patiently with no answer  so she knocked again with no luck. <strong><em>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>The  blonde put her ear to the door and she thought she heard a faint sound  of water running. The girl pulled back from the door and headed  straight to her room. Layla was a woman that couldn&rsquo;t be deterred when  she was determined. After she enter her room again she noted that  Passion was conspicuously absent. Not bothering to give it a second  thought the former Kaleido star walked through her bedroom and on to  the balcony outside. Sora&rsquo;s balcony was a good distance from Layla&rsquo;s  but she made easier jumps in her sleep. The blonde gripped the food she  brought and hopped up on the ledge. The morning traffic was in full  swing and she could see everything perfectly form her high vantage  point. A normal person would have been scared stupid to be standing on  a seven inch railing overlooking a street several stories high, but  this just happened to be Layla&rsquo;s element. She saw her target on the  other side and then she closed her eyes. Everything in her surrounding  was pictured perfectly in her mind. Without bothering to reopen her  eyes, Layla leaped from the ledge to cleared a distance few people in  the world could pull off.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Sora  was working on autopilot since she got back to her apartment. Fool  tried to engage her in conversation but she ignored him. She decided to  shower and put some distance between her thoughts and she was half way  through her morning ritual when she realized her actions toward the  blonde was very rude. Layla went through all this trouble this morning  to get her breakfast and she just walked out on the other woman with  little consideration. &ldquo;I could at least take my rejections with dignity  and do it over a nice meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brunette decided to apologize as  soon as she was done but when she left the bathroom, wearing nothing  but a towel, she was shocked with the sight that was before her. There  laid out in front of her was a very expensive looking meal sitting on  the floor at the foot of the bed. That wasn&rsquo;t the only thing sitting at  the foot of the bed, a certain blonde haired performer waited patiently  there with her eyes averted away form Sora. &ldquo;Layla-san?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lets do this right Sora.&rdquo; said the other woman with her eyes still averted. &ldquo;Good Morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;huh...oh  good morning to you too.&rdquo; Sora was wondering why the taller girl  refused to look at her. With her insecurities still fresh in her mind  she inquired about it nervously. &ldquo;Is there something wrong because you  wont look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blonde nodded and Sora&rsquo;s heart sank but  before the brunette could dwell on it, Layla pointed at the Kaleido  star&rsquo;s laid out clothes. &ldquo;I think it would be best if you got dressed  before we talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora looked down at the towel she was wearing  and noticed she happened to pick out the smallest one. The thin white  material scantily covered her body and left little imagination to the  rest. &ldquo;Ach, sorry Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taller woman blushed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m complaining it&rsquo;s just a little distracting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  nervously laughed as she grabbed her clothes and went to get dressed.  When she returned this time Layla wasn&rsquo;t looking away from her but  rather she was looking directly in her eyes with a determined look.  &ldquo;Please have some breakfast, I think it&rsquo;s best we have a talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brunette nodded and sat down across from Layla. &ldquo;How did you get in here? I thought I locked the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla gave Sora a cocky grin. &ldquo;The other door wasn&rsquo;t locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  other door&hellip;&rdquo; Sora noticed her balcony door was open to the cool morning  breeze. &ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t tell me you&hellip;&rdquo; the brunette trailed off.</p>
<p>Layla nodded. &ldquo;It was simple but I had to see you before it was too late.&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&hellip;&rdquo; began Sora but Layla cut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please  Sora, I need to get everything out in the open.&rdquo; the blonde looked away  for a second to gather up her will before she continued. &ldquo;Last night  was fun, I&rsquo;d have to say it was one of the most enjoyable times I&rsquo;ve  ever had that weren&rsquo;t fifty feet up in the air doing some impossible  stunt. I never knew spending time with someone could that fulfilling.  It was an exhilarating experience and I think the excitement got to our  heads. We gave into the moment and we lost control, it&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the one out of control Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taller girl shook her head. &ldquo;We both were. I could have stopped all your advances but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, I was way out of line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  gave Sora one of her rare smiles. &ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want to. I wanted  your affections probably more than you know, but looking at it now, I  realized we were both jumping the gun a little.&rdquo; Sora nodded in  understanding as Layla continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I  regretted last night. I don&rsquo;t ever want you to think I don&rsquo;t want this,  because wherever we are going I want it to be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora smiled. &ldquo;Like being partners again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only true partner I&rsquo;ll ever have Sora so don&rsquo;t be scared off because you think I can&rsquo;t take what you can dish out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  like it always did, Layla&rsquo;s words gave Sora strength. She felt a  million times better that everything was out in the open and the blonde  didn&rsquo;t have any regrets over last night. &ldquo;Your right as always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you..&rdquo; whatever Layla was going to say was cut off by the sound of  Sora&rsquo;s stomach. The brunette&rsquo;s face started glowing, and Layla put a  hand over her mouth to choke back the laughter that was bubbling at her  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to disagree&hellip;&rdquo; Layla was once again cut off but this time it wasn&rsquo;t Sora&rsquo;s stomach that did it, it was hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;guess&hellip;that&hellip;means&hellip;we&hellip;should&hellip;eat.&rdquo; said Sora in between bursts of he own laughter.</p>
<p>A very dignified Layla scoffed. &ldquo;Stop laughing so hard or you&rsquo;ll spit food all over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora controlled herself and turned to the food. &ldquo;This looks delicious, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  welcome.&rdquo; said Layla as they both began eating. The morning angst was  now behind them and they just ate while enjoying the others company. &ldquo;I  have to apologize for intruding on your privacy with the window stunt  but I couldn&rsquo;t let things sit like they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand but I  can&rsquo;t say that I would do the same thing in your position.&rdquo; Sora  thought it was a very romantic thing for Layla to do. &ldquo;That jump was  way to long for me to pull it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you could do it.&rdquo; said the blond as she smiled. &ldquo;But I guess that means I still haven&rsquo;t lost my touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  better believe it.&rdquo; Sora&rsquo;s smile beamed. &ldquo;Soon the posters will say  &lsquo;The Magnificent Layla returns to Kaleido stage to wow the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if the surgery is successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  reached over and placed her hand over Layla&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Of course it will.&rdquo; the  brunette looked over Layla&rsquo;s shoulder to the outside ledge where Fool  sat and appeared to be talking to himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll even be able see  Fool in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool called back into the room. <em>&ldquo;I heard that.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Layla,  who was not able to hear fool, continued on without taking note of the  interruption. &ldquo;Sora, today is the day I&rsquo;m going to be admitted to the  hospital for the preliminary tests and examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought surgery was tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blond nodded. &ldquo;It is but Dr. Everett needs to start me on medication that&rsquo;s essential for the surgeries success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they safe?&rdquo; asked a concerned Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor says so but I need to remain under examination till I go under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora nodded and hoped this wasn&rsquo;t the last meal they were sharing today. &ldquo;So when do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  afternoon.&rdquo; the room was quiet after she said that and the room fell  into an awkward silence. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s presumptuous of me to ask but  would you like to come with me when I go. I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Everett would  like to meet the woman involved in the legendary maneuver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have to ask?&ldquo; The brunette smiled happily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to go Layla-san.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; said Layla who meant it from the bottom of her heart. &ldquo;So this is what that feels like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having someone who will be there for me when I need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  brunette didn&rsquo;t say anything. Having Layla wanting her to be around for  one of the most crucial moments in her life meant the world to Sora. A  tightness formed in the Kaleido star&rsquo;s chest, she knew if she didn&rsquo;t do  something about the feeling it would become unbearable. After a small  debate in her head, Sora scooted closer to Layla. &ldquo;May I kiss you?&rdquo;  asked the shorter woman with a warm look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  reached over and gently ran her fingers down the length of Layla&rsquo;s  hair. It grew a lot since she cut it and the silken tresses now reached  past Layla&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Your letting your hair grow long again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  blonde simply nodded. She didn&rsquo;t want to say anything for fear of  breaking the spell that enveloped them in their private moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  always thought your hair was beautiful.&rdquo; whispered the smaller woman as  her fingers slowly brushed along Layla&rsquo;s chin while she was glided them  across the other woman&rsquo;s hair. She stopped when a silent plea came  through from Layla&rsquo;s bright blue orbs. Sora knew what the taller woman  wanted and she didn&rsquo;t waste any time as she leaned up and brushed her  lips gently over Layla&rsquo;s. The kiss was slow and tender and the brunette  relished every second of it.</p>
<p>This kiss was nothing like the one  Sora gave Layla last night. While those were hungry ones laces with  sexuality, this one was on a whole different level. This was the kind  of kiss that portrayed the deepest type of affection. Sora might not  have said the words out loud but her kiss was telling Layla the one  thing she secretly longed to hear all her life. <em>&lsquo;I love you&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<p>A  warm feeling spread throughout the blonde&rsquo;s body and it was the same  feeling she had when kissed Sora goodnight. The words she uttered at  that moment still echoed clearly in her mind. <em>&ldquo;Good night my love.&rdquo;</em> When she said that it was done on instinct but she realized that deep  in her heart, for the first time, those words were true. Layla didn&rsquo;t  have to say the words out loud either but she poured every drop of her  heart into her lips as she answered the other woman&rsquo;s unspoken  confession with her own. <strong><em>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
