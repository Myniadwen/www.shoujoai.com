<p>----------</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did everything go last night?&rdquo; asked Passion sitting on a ledge over looking the busy street below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, I have to say I&rsquo;m having more fun than I can remember.&rdquo; said Fool who was trying to shoo a pigeon from his spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t see you so waving your arms around like an idiot is pointless.&rdquo; chuckled Passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know but I was hopping my annoyance would get through to it.&rdquo; said Fool  as he gave up and walked on the other side of Passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was  nice, now the pigeon can annoy me.&rdquo; just then that pigeon found  something else of interest and flew off. Passion turned to Fool, &ldquo;That  was real chivalrous of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get with the times, your liberated,  that means you can deal with your own monster pigeons.&rdquo; said Fool who  decided to change the subject. &ldquo;What happened with Layla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She pined over her Asian doll, it was so sweet it nearly brought me to tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a horrible liar.&rdquo; returned Fool neutrally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liar?&rdquo; questioned Passion confused by Fool response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  known Layla for a long time and I know for certain that she is not the  type of person to pine over someone.&rdquo; said Fool matter of factly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be pleasantly supervised then.&rdquo; Passion laughed lightly then continued. &ldquo;I bet this is Layla&rsquo;s first <em>real </em>crush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really, this should be interesting to watch.&rdquo; mused Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of girls with crushes, how are you holding things at your end?</p>
<p>It was Fools turn to laugh. &ldquo;Are you kidding me? I don&rsquo;t have to do anything, Sora&rsquo;s had a thing for Layla since the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion thought that was ridiculous. &ldquo;Sora had a thing for Layla since she was five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  not five, I was talking about the second time they met at Kaleido  tryouts.&rdquo; said Fool clarifying his statement. &ldquo;How did you know about  the first time they met? I didn&rsquo;t feel your presence that day and even  they don&rsquo;t remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the spirit of romance, its my job to know everything about Layla, past and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pays  to know your charges background, I thought Sora was a timid Japanese  girl but I found out the hard way just how violent she can be.&rdquo; said  Fool remembering the constant physical punishment he suffered at the  hands of the Kaleido star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like last night at the restaurant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  had to bring that up again didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; responded Fool still sore after  last night&rsquo;s incident. &ldquo;Never let a gymnast kick you, it hurts more  than you can imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet.&rdquo; said Passion then she changed the  subject. &ldquo;What are we going to do for today? Both girls are bound to be  in the same room with each other, and our charges will start to think  its strange that we always disappear when it happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should just ignore each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignore each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  our ladies can&rsquo;t see each others guiding spirit then we can be in the  same room without them growing wise to our conspiracy.&rdquo; reasoned Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good but can you keep your eyes off my beautiful self?&rdquo; joked Passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo; answered Fool sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  look on Passion&rsquo;s face was priceless and Fool let out an ear splitting  laugh, but that quickly turned into an ear splitting scream as the  pigeon returned and began trampling all over Fool. Now it was Passion&rsquo;s  turn to laugh her ass off. &ldquo;Merci monsieur pigeon, merci.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Sora&rsquo;s room 386</p>
<p>When  the spirit of the stage returned to the room he heard the shower  running. &ldquo;Why do I always arrive too late?&rdquo; said fool as he plopped up  on a chair and waited for Sora to finish. <strong><em>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s in store for today?&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>In the bathroom a towel wrapped Sora stood staring at the mirror wondering the same thing. <strong><em>&ldquo;That was an interesting dream.&rdquo; </em></strong>thought the brunette.</p>
<p>During  the night her dreams were filled with images of the kiss that her and  Layla shared. It was filled with kissing and a whole lot more. It was  the first time Sora had such a mischievous dream, and it involved Layla  which made her even more flustered. She had just started opening up to  possibility of dating the blonde and after they shared their first kiss  she was already having naughty dreams. After waking up the only way to  reign in her errant thoughts were to take a shower that was more cold  than warm.</p>
<p>Looking at her reflection Sora had to put her foot  down. &ldquo;Listen you, this is going too fast, take it slow or you&rsquo;ll ruin  everything. And what&rsquo;s with that dream, did you turn into Fool or  something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool&rsquo;s voice called out from the other side of the door. &ldquo;I heard that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop eavesdropping, I&rsquo;m having a private conversation.&rdquo; Sora yelled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there another spirit in there I don&rsquo;t know about, I admit I&rsquo;m little jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  shut up Fool.&rdquo; turning back to her reflection she gave herself a  credulous look. &ldquo;Why am I talking to myself, am I going crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say yes.&rdquo; came Fool&rsquo;s detached voice again.</p>
<p>Sora sighed. <strong><em>&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; </em></strong>thought the Kaleido star as got dressed and exited the room. Fool was lounging on the chair&rsquo;s arm rest looking very amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you having raunchy dreams now, I must say that&rsquo;s very adult of you Sora?&rdquo; questioned Fool with a stupid smirk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, I can have any kind of dream I want to, and I&rsquo;ll have you know  I&rsquo;m eighteen now.&rdquo; said Sora who sat back on the bed and relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh eighteen huh, I guess your old enough to buy a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would I want to I don&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you going to after you and Layla have&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  put her hands to ears. &ldquo;ahhhhhhhhhh, stop that.&rdquo; satisfied that Fool  was finished she took her hands off. &ldquo;Fool that&rsquo;s not even funny, I  know your trying to rile me up but that kind of talk is too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, its not like you haven&rsquo;t thought about it.&rdquo; reasoned Fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually  I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m trying to take it slow and get used to everything, but  those kind of thoughts are gigantic leaps that I&rsquo;m not ready to think  about yet.&rdquo; explained Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora blushed and shook her head. &ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t count, I was asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say dreams are windows into the soul.&rdquo; said Fool slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool&hellip;that&rsquo;s the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  your right but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. I was thinking it would help if you  described your dream detail by detail, because getting that off your  chest will make you feel&hellip;..&rdquo; Fool&rsquo;s rambling was cut off by Sora&rsquo;s  sudden appearance. The brunette grabbed Fool and shoved him into a  dresser. A moment later Fool was beating on the door from the inside.  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do this to me, I&rsquo;m a free spirit, and I was only trying to  help.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Layla&rsquo;s room 385</p>
<p>Unlike  Sora who was always quick to wake up, Layla was a deep sleeper. Passion  was starting to wonder if Layla was going to sleep the day away. She  couldn&rsquo;t have that, it was a perfect day outside and she was not going  to let her charge waste it in bed. The spirit looked around the room  for something to wake up the comatose blonde. Spotting the overhead  wall lamp, Passion floated up to it and switched it on and pointed it  towards the blonde&rsquo;s eyes. The only affect it had on Layla was causing  her to turn towards the windowed side of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, how  about some natural sunlight.&rdquo; Passion flew towards the window and  opened the curtain. A blast of sunlight hit the blonde directly in the  face, making Layla put her right arm over her eyes, but it didn&rsquo;t wake  her up. &ldquo;I see madam you are immune to the indirect methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  spirit floated near Layla&rsquo;s ear and began to say her name softly at  first. &ldquo;Layla, Layla, Laaaayyylaaaa.&rdquo; finished Passion in a sing song  voice.</p>
<p>Layla began to stir. &ldquo;Finally.&rdquo; said Passion thinking she was triumphant.</p>
<p>The blonde only turned back over and let out a moan accompanied by a name. &ldquo;Soraaaa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silver haired woman had enough decency to blush. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t want to wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion was debating whether or not to interrupt Layla&rsquo;s pleasant dream but the sound of the phone ringing fixed that for her.</p>
<p>Layla  shot up in bed, her shoulder lengthed blonde hair was a mess. She  turned towards the phone in a daze, for few moments she didn&rsquo;t know  where she was. When the girl snapped out of her stupor she reached over  and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora?&rdquo; said Layla as the first thing that popped out of her mouth.</p>
<p>On  the other end was Macquarie. The maid couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that her  mistress called out the other girl&rsquo;s name in a smoky voice that sounded  like a moan. &ldquo;N.n.n..no mistress, its me Macquarie, you asked me to  wake you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla came back to reality. &ldquo;Thank you Macquarie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was no problem mistress, I know how restful you get when you sleep.  I&rsquo;ll be over there momentarily.&rdquo; with that the phone call ended.</p>
<p>The  blonde closed her eyes and reached over to place the phone in its  holder, after a few attempts she finally landed it. Layla opened her  eyes again and stared at the ceiling. Normally she couldn&rsquo;t remember  her dreams but the one she just had was exceptionally vivid. Her face  turned beet red and she grabbed her pillow and covered her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant thoughts?&rdquo; came Passion&rsquo;s voice interrupting the blonde&rsquo;s attempt to bury herself in the sheets.</p>
<p>Removing the pillow, Layla looked bleary eyed over at the spirit. &ldquo;Your still here?&rdquo; said the blonde sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where else would I be madam.&rdquo; returned the silver haired woman who was sitting cross legged on the vanities counter.</p>
<p>Layla sighed and got out of bed. She walked to the center of the room and began to do stretches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blonde looked over at Passion. &ldquo;Exercising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This early, you just woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla shrugged and went back to her workout. &ldquo;It helps me wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more of tea and croissant woman myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  workout went uninterrupted for thirty minutes until there was a knock  at the door. Layla walked up to the door and stopped. Normally she  would just open the door to see who it was, but thinking it could be  Sora made her become self aware. Her hair was a mess and she was sweaty  from her workout, it wasn&rsquo;t the image she wanted to show the brunette  this late in the morning. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its Macquarie.&rdquo; answered the voice from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Layla sighed in relief and opened the door. Macquarie was standing there with a covered tray. &ldquo;Morning please come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After closing the door the two woman walked back into the apartment. &ldquo;I brought your breakfast mistress, I hope you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course not.&rdquo; replied Layla. The blonde saw it was her favorite and  smiled. &ldquo;Thank you Macquarie, what would I do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  simple comment made Macquarie&rsquo;s day. &ldquo;It was really no problem.&rdquo; It was  then the maid noticed Layla&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Did you have restless night  mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla blushed <strong><em>&ldquo;How could she know about my dream?&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you say that Macquarie?&rdquo; asked Layla probingly.</p>
<p>Macquarie was embarrassed to point it out. &ldquo;Your hair is&hellip;.well it&rsquo;s mess so you were probably tossing in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blonde sighed. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; you could say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it wasn&rsquo;t that bad?&rdquo; inquired the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Quite the opposite.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought Layla. &ldquo;It was fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you eat then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m going to take a shower right now, I&rsquo;ll eat later.&rdquo; with that said the blonde walked towards the bedroom. <strong><em>&ldquo;It will probably be a cold one.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Room 386</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are you doing today?&rdquo; asked Fool who was watching Sora balance on one hand upside down on the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I didn&rsquo;t plan anything out.&rdquo; returned Sora who was growing  dizzy from all the blood rushing to her head. She returned up right in  the chair and hugged her knees to her chest. &ldquo;I hoping on spending the  day with Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call Layla and ask her out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to interrupt her, she going into surgery the day after tomorrow and I&rsquo;m sure she is busy.&rdquo; reasoned Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  called you all the way here, you should at least hangout with one  another.&rdquo; said Fool as he floated to the fruit basket and commandeered  a grape the size of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you being so pushy? Layla would tell me if she wanted to spend time with me.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I guess we see who&rsquo;s going to wear the pants in that relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora turned to look at Fool. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was kidding&rdquo; said Fool trying to placate Sora. He didn&rsquo;t want a repeat  of his earlier imprisonment. &ldquo;My point is you should be more assertive,  you like her right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; said Sora like it was the easiest question in the world.</p>
<p>The  spirit knew it was time to make his point. &ldquo;Then ask her out, demand  some of her time. If you don&rsquo;t show yourself more respect now, then she  isn&rsquo;t going to respect you either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora thought about that for a  minute, if there was any future for her and Layla it had to be built on  mutual respect. Layla didn&rsquo;t need another admirer, she needed a  partner. &ldquo;Maybe your right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you agree for once.&rdquo; Fool  was satisfied she acknowledged his sound advice. &ldquo;Maybe you should  start calling me sensei too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Fool as he sensed he went to far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; returned Sora who was confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to ask her out?&rdquo; asked Fool.</p>
<p>Sora  thought it over for a moment while she gathered her resolve. When she  was ready she held her clenched fist in front of her. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; called out  Sora but then she remembered something she forgot to do. &ldquo;But after I  make a phone call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool sighed, he knew the brunette had a tendency to keep putting things off. &ldquo;Who are you calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  friend Manami. She goes to school here and the least I can do is say  hi, maybe plan to meet up later this week.&rdquo; answered Sora as she walked  over to the phone. She went all the way to Boston and this was the  first time she thought of her friend. <strong><em>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t remember that Manami went to school here.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weasel your way out by making other plans, you said you were asking out Layla.&rdquo; said Fool as Sora dialed the numbers.</p>
<p>Sora  looked over at Fool. &ldquo;I am, it just makes the butterflies in my stomach  flutter around mach ten. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t say no&rdquo; Sora would have  continued but the sound of someone picking up the phone cut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, is this Manami&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; asked the brunette into the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; came a woman&rsquo;s reply that didn&rsquo;t sound like her Japanese friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Sora, I&rsquo;m Manami&rsquo;s friend from Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  your Sora. My names Cheryl, I&rsquo;m Manami&rsquo;s roommate. Are you girls having  a good time?&rdquo; returned a cheerful girls voice on the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good time?&rdquo; asked a puzzled Sora.</p>
<p>It  was Cheryl&lsquo;s turn to be confused. &ldquo;Ya, Manami flew all the way to Cape  Mary, I thought you guys would be having a blast catching up on old  times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was news to Sora. &ldquo;Cape Mary&hellip;..When did she go to Cape Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, didn&rsquo;t she visit you yet?&rdquo; returned the other girl, she worried something happened to her friend.</p>
<p>Sora groaned. <strong><em>&ldquo;Of all the luck, she visits me and I&rsquo;m not there.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m in Boston right now.&rdquo; answered the Kaleido star sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo; said Manami&rsquo;s roommate who broke out in laughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;s not mad at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheryl&lsquo;s laughter died down some. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be alright once you call her and explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, her cell is broken.&rdquo; said an exasperated Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never got one.&rdquo; said Sora as Manami&rsquo;s roommate broke out in a new round of giggles.</p>
<p>Sora frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the irony but forget about that, if she calls here I&rsquo;ll give her your room number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; said Sora as she told Cheryl her room information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, nice talking to you.&rdquo; said the other girl before she hung up</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arigato.&rdquo; returned Sora as she disconnected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Fool after Sora turned around.</p>
<p>Sora sat down on the sofa and blew her hair out of her eyes. &ldquo;<strong><em>It getting kind of long, I could use one of your haircuts right now Manami.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami  went to Cape Mary to visit me the same time I left.&rdquo; said Sora finally  answering the spirit&rsquo;s question. Fool looked at her for a moment before  he started laughing &ldquo;Not you too.&rdquo; said the brunette with a sigh.</p>
<p>Fool  put his hands in the air to stop another one of Sora outbursts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry, I&rsquo;ll see if I can read her fortune.&rdquo; with that Fool produced a  ring of tarot cards where he chose one and flipped it over to see with  his one visible eye. &ldquo;I see the inverted sun, hmm&hellip; her future was paved  in a darkness she couldn&rsquo;t see and this accidental trip will help her  discover her dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora was surprised at Manami&rsquo;s fortune. &ldquo;Does that mean everything will work out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool merely shrugged. &ldquo;Its not for me to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it when you do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Cape Mary Noon.</p>
<p>Ken  made the rounds like he always did. There was so much more to Kaleido  stage than people thought. When Ken wasn&rsquo;t assisting performers during  the show days, he made sure the carpenters had their raw materials for  the elaborate stages, performers had all of their costumes and  cosmetics ready for the show, and generally he made sure everything  went smoothly. Today was no different, just because all of the  performers had some time off didn&rsquo;t mean he could join them. If  anything the off days were his busiest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Mr. Towner, I need  to reorder the plywood shipment, what we got was only half of what we  need.&rdquo; said Ken talking to one of Kaleido stage&rsquo;s suppliers. &ldquo;OK&hellip;.I  understand&hellip;.Yes, ok take care.&rdquo; finished the blonde as he hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse  me?&rdquo; at the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice, Ken turned towards the supply  room entrance. Standing there was a Japanese girl he thought seemed  familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; questioned Ken to the girl that shouldn&rsquo;t be in the inventory area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recognize me do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally it dawned o him. &ldquo;Your Sora&rsquo;s friend from Japan right? The one that goes to college in Boston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my name is Manami.&rdquo; said the Japanese girl as she scanned the massive  stockpile of raw materials. She became distracted as to why she went  down here in the first place. &ldquo;Wow&hellip;there is a lot stuff here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya,  every time there is a new production you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how much work  goes into them, John, the head carpenter, doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit for  the amazing stage&rsquo;s they produce.&rdquo; said Ken happily but then he  remembered the oddity of the girls presence back here. &ldquo;Is there  something I can help you with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snapping out of her explorations  Manami answered. &ldquo;Sorry I got distracted, the guys in the front told me  you knew where Sora was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kind of missed her, she went to Boston yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami  looked surprised at this. &ldquo;Are you telling me I came all the way from  Boston and that&rsquo;s where she went. Of all the luck&hellip;&rdquo; Manami sighed. &ldquo;Did  she go there to visit me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually she went there to help Layla with something.&rdquo; answered Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layla? That blonde she has a crush on?&rdquo; mumbled Manami to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya.&rdquo; Ken had to do a double take. <strong><em>&ldquo;What did she just say?&rdquo; </em></strong>Ken cleared his throat. &ldquo;Excuse me what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that she said that out loud, Manami tried to backtrack. &ldquo;I said she went to the blonde she rushed that act with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken let a sigh of relief out. <strong><em>&ldquo;Good my ears were playing tricks on me.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know when she will be back?&rdquo; questioned the brunette trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks at the most I think, we have to do one more run of <u>The phoenix </u>before we switch productions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two  weeks.&rdquo; Manami sighed and sat down of one of the crates. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  believe I took a vacation all the way here to surprise her and she&rsquo;s  gone.&rdquo; said the brunette woman as she began swinging her legs back and  forth. &ldquo;I prepaid a hotel and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken sympathized with  her, he wasn&rsquo;t that happy about Sora&rsquo;s impromptu trip either. &ldquo;I  thought she would be around too but since you&rsquo;re here what are you  going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo; mused Manami. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know&hellip;.my flight doesn&rsquo;t leave till the twenty first, and I don&rsquo;t want  to waste my deposit.&rdquo; Manami stopped her leg&rsquo;s movements and let out a  sigh. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happened to know anything fun to do around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken  had to laugh at that. &ldquo;Your standing in one of the countries greatest  entertainment venues and you ask is there anything fun to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I think this is a good chance to get to know one of Sora&rsquo;s Japanese friends.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know Manami I&rsquo;m about all done here, would you like to have a cup of  coffee with me? There&rsquo;s a really nice caf&eacute; right outside of Kaleido  stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami got off the crate and turned towards the blonde. &ldquo;<strong><em>This might be a good chance to get to know one of Sora&rsquo;s new American friends.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a tea and your on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>The mistress seemed flushed. I wonder if she had another one of her nightmares.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought Macquarie as she prepared Layla&rsquo;s breakfast. Her actions were interrupted by the phone&rsquo;s ringing.</p>
<p>Macquarie walked over and picked it up. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macquarie?&rdquo; came Sora&rsquo;s voice from the other line. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were over there this early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macquarie hoped knowing that would upset Sora a little. &ldquo;Yes I&rsquo;m here every morning to wake up mistress Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Layla there?&rdquo; came Sora&rsquo;s nervous reply.</p>
<p>The maid was glad Layla was still taking a shower. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s busy right now, could you call back later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Macquarie finished saying that, Layla came out of the bathroom drying her golden hair. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macquarie  could have cursed. &ldquo;Oh mistress your finished.&rdquo; the maid put her hand  over the phone. &ldquo;Sora&rsquo;s on the phone, would you like to speak to her?&rdquo;  asked Macquarie as she secretly hoped the blonde would say no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Layla as she grabbed the phone from Macquarie. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning Layla. I&rsquo;m not bothering you am I?&rdquo; came Sora&rsquo;s voice from the other line.</p>
<p>Layla  gave an involuntary slight smile when she heard the other woman&lsquo;s  voice, it wasn&rsquo;t missed by Passion&rsquo;s nor Macquarie&rsquo;s intent gaze. &ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;ve actually been wanting to talk to you since last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  brunette took a deep breath. &ldquo;Then we should go out today, I think it  would be fun.&rdquo; said Sora very quickly over the phone. Layla couldn&rsquo;t  hear Fool shouting at Sora to be more assertive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Kaleido star didn&rsquo;t let Layla finish her answer. &ldquo;I wont take no for an  answer!&rdquo; yelled Sora who had Fool tell her she was too assertive.</p>
<p>Layla was stunned by a demanding Sora but she found herself smiling anyway. &ldquo;Ok sure, I was going to say I&rsquo;d love too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really, that&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo; returned Sora with nervous laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want to go out?&rdquo; asked Layla curious as to what Sora had planned.</p>
<p>It took the Kaleido star a few seconds to respond &ldquo;&hellip;.how about later this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool  was bugging Sora about Layla&lsquo;s response so she decided to end the  conversation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date Layla, bye.&rdquo; said the brunette as she hung  up.</p>
<p>It took the blonde a few seconds to hang up.<strong><em> &ldquo;Did she just say date?&rdquo; </em></strong>Layla mused it over in her head for awhile before she decided she liked the idea of going out on a date.<strong><em> &ldquo;Well I guess I&rsquo;m going on a date then.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Miss Naegino want?&rdquo; asked Macquarie who was unable to take the suspense anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  asked me out on a da&hellip;..&rdquo; Layla began to say but changed her mind when  she realized how it would sound, she wasn&rsquo;t ready for that yet. &ldquo;She  wanted to catch up and see the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>That sounds like a date.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought the maid. &ldquo;And your going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; said Layla as if it was the most obvious thing in the universe.</p>
<p>Macquarie  couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was hearing. &ldquo;But mistress this afternoon  your meeting with the Paradise hotel&rsquo;s owner on behalf of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lately  her relationship with her father was getting worse, and the blonde was  tired of trying to do everything to make him happy when it failed to  make anything better. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not important, my father can sign his own  contracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla sighed and looked at the  maid. &ldquo;Look Macquarie, I always do what my father says without  question, but just this once I&rsquo;m going to do what I want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  you think gallivanting about town is more important than doing  something your father entrusted you with?&rdquo; argued Macquarie, she  normally wouldn&rsquo;t take this tone of voice with her mistress but the  woman was being unreasonable from her point of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I do.&rdquo; said the blonde as she walked off, effectively ending the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Nice caf&eacute; outside of Kaleido Stage, Cape Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  long have you been at Kaleido stage?&rdquo; asked Manami as she took a sip of  her tea. It wasn&rsquo;t the quality she was used too but the interesting  company made up for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been at Kaleido stage for four  years. I first joined as a performer but after an injury my job changed  from performer to coordinator.&rdquo; answered Ken while he took a sip of his  coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a performer? What kind of act did you perform?&rdquo;  Manami was surprised to hear about Ken&rsquo;s athletic career, he didn&rsquo;t  seem like the most physically suited for Kaleido stage.</p>
<p>The  blonde knew that look on her face, it was the same look he saw on  everyone&rsquo;s face when he told them about his performing days. &ldquo;Actually  I was a trapeze artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; said Ken as he laughed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did trapeze just like Sora, I have to say I&rsquo;m a little surprised.&rdquo;  Manami just couldn&rsquo;t picture Ken doing the dangerous routines. &ldquo;What  kind of accident did you have?&rdquo; asked the brunette before she realized  just how insensitive that sounded. &ldquo;Unless you don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No its ok.&rdquo; Ken took a minute before he began retelling the past.</p>
<p align="center">Three years ago</p>
<p>The Kaleido stage was filled with the constant cheers of adoring fans. The current production of <u>Pirates of the Caribbean </u>was  a smashing success. The acrobatic stunts used by the trampoliners were  a sight to behold. One performer dressed in a pseudo British uniform  crossed swords in mid air with a pseudo pirate causing a clash of metal  that sung out into the crowd. The cheers of the crowd were deafening,  especially the children who were so loud the parents had to spend time  calming them down between acts. Despite the entertainment, the people  were waiting patiently for the highlight of the show. The high rise  scene was going to be played by a promising new star making his d&eacute;but,  and according to the hype it was going to be a sight to see.</p>
<p>Behind  the raising platform Ken stood anxiously waiting for his moment in the  spotlight. The wait made him nervous and scared at the same time, and  he couldn&rsquo;t help but check his racing heart beat.</p>
<p>This action was noticed by another watching him from behind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; called out the man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Ken  turned around and saw Fool floating in the middle of the room. &ldquo;I have  to, its something I need to do.&rdquo; said Ken who wasn&rsquo;t surprised by the  sight of the floating spirit.</p>
<p>Fool hadn&rsquo;t known Ken for very long  but he came to like the guy. He had an amazing spirit even at a time  like this. A week ago he started having episodes of chest pains, and  shortness of breaths, the attacks were especially bad after long hours  of practice. When he went to the doctor he found out he had a faulty  valve in his heart. The news hit him hard because he was only a week  away from staring in his first performance. It turned out the heavy  physical exercise was pushing his heart beyond its capacity and ran the  risk of getting a serious attack that might be fatal. The doctor told  him an immediate surgery could repair the heart and he would go about  life as normal but if he continued putting strain on the organ it could  lead to irreversible damage. Which meant his d&eacute;but was out of the  question. Ken knew he shouldn&rsquo;t go on but the stage called out to him  and he refused to quit.</p>
<p>That was a week ago and Ken went on  despite his doctor&rsquo;s warnings. This was his big chance to be a star and  he was damned if he was going to waste it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fortune foretells a great tragedy will befall you if you get on the stage tonight.&rdquo; said Fool warning Ken one last time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can see you Fool which means I&rsquo;m destined to be a star right? Even  after my heart problem, which could only mean that everything will work  out.&rdquo; reasoned Ken.</p>
<p>Fool realized he wouldn&rsquo;t get through to him.  Ken had the same look in his eyes that other performers got after they  learned of the legendary maneuver. There was no talking him out of it  and it wasn&rsquo;t Fool&rsquo;s place to interfere. &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a stage hand walked out and gave Ken the thumbs up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken began walking up to the platform. &ldquo;<strong><em>This is my time&hellip; this is the moment I was destined for.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Each  step up the ladder brought a pang of excitement, but the problem was it  also brought a small prick of pain in his chest. His heart beat was  racing achingly fast but he didn&rsquo;t care, the crowd&rsquo;s cheers were like a  drug and he wanted more. The light was turned off closer to the top and  people didn&rsquo;t see him preparing his stunt. It was a simple back flip  and double spin before reaching the other side and he knew he could do  it in his sleep. As he stood on the top platform the lights finally  flashed towards him and it was time to do his performance. The stage  was so high up, and as he reached for his bar he was overcome with  vertigo. He nearly stumbled off the platform but he caught himself. He  hoped no one noticed. His breathing became a little harder and the  prick of pain became a surge. He tried to curve his breathing before he  plunged into the air far above the stage but it was becoming an  impossible task. It was then Ken had second thoughts about this whole  thing. He might have stopped then but the trampoline act ended cuing  him to jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its now or never.&rdquo; called out Ken as he stepped  forward and leaped into the air swinging across the distance. This was  his moment, and he reveled in it. The incoming bar was so close now and  he made the plunge. His flip and spin came off perfectly and the crowd  cheered. Ken flew in the air and righted himself to catch the incoming  bar but that&rsquo;s when things turned disastrous. The sound of crowd faded  as he reached out for the bar, the sound of his heart was all he heard.  The hard rhythmic thump thump turned into a thump&hellip;thump thump&hellip;. thump,  and then the whole world around him faded into black.</p>
<p>Two days  later Ken awoke in a hospital staring at his parents who were worried  sick. That was the day he found out his life changed forever. The  strain of that nights performance caused a major heart attack. The  surgery that saved his life was performed by a new heart surgeon named  Kate Benning who performed the operation even after several hospital  surgeons said there was nothing that could be done. It was that red  headed doctor that gave Ken the horrible news that he would never be  able to perform again. If he went under the knife before the heart  attack there was a chance the valve in his chest could be a hundred  percent repaired, but after the attack it damaged more than the valve  but the heart itself. He could go about a normal life but if he  stressed out to much it could cause another attack that might be fatal.  From that day on Ken lost all hope of standing on the stage. As his  hope began to fade so did his ability to see Fool until the day came  when he couldn&rsquo;t see the spirit ever again.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Present day</p>
<p>Manami  was shocked to hear his story. The man went through so much yet he was  sitting before her obviously happy with himself and his life. After the  shock wore off Manami continued her questioning. &ldquo;How did you end up  staying at Kaleido stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken smiled. &ldquo;I gave up on one dream  only to find another.&rdquo; Ken leaned back in his chair. &ldquo;When I went to  Kalos to resign he refused to take it. He said just because I couldn&rsquo;t  perform didn&rsquo;t mean I should give up on Kaleido stage. I guess he knew  deep down that I loved the place and wasn&rsquo;t ready to leave it just yet  so he gave me a job of taking care of small things around the stage,  kind of like his assistant. It was then I learned how fulfilling life  could be making sure the show went smoothly. The cheers of the audience  were the most important thing about Kaleido stage and it took my  accident to make me finally realize that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami didn&rsquo;t know  what to say. There was more to the boy then she realized. She had  always thought of him as some ordinary boy that was crushing over Sora,  and now she realized he was a person that almost had his world crushed.  &ldquo;Even after that you were able to become a vital part of Kaleido stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vital  part of Kaleido stage?&rdquo; questioned Ken somewhat embarrassed by the  praise. &ldquo;I just help out the performers is all, I like to think I do my  part but I wouldn&rsquo;t say what I did was vital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Sora she would have never made it without you being there at every step making sure she got up after she fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora  said that?&rdquo; mused Ken before he shook his head and smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sora  for you, she keeps overlooking her own part in things. She was the one  who always pulled herself up after every fall, and I was just happy to  be there to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami knew Ken was too modest to admit his  own importance so she decided to leave it for now. &ldquo;This chat was too  heavy, I didn&rsquo;t want you to hangout and have to relive painful  memories.&rdquo; Manami got out of her seat and went to pay for the drinks.</p>
<p>Ken was taken off guard by the change of mood and quickly followed her. &ldquo;Hey! Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami  turned around and shrugged. &ldquo;Lets go do something fun, you&rsquo;re the  native so show me around.&rdquo; said Manami giving Ken an impish half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;o..oo..OK.&rdquo; stuttered Ken in response. The blonde was flustered at the sight of Manami&rsquo;s mischievous grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>What is it with me and Japanese girls?&rdquo; </strong></em>reflected Ken as he followed the brunette out of the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Boston. Hamilton Hotel, room 386</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  hopeless you know that?&rdquo; said Fool staring at Sora who was standing by  the mirror switching two outfits in her hand back and forth over  herself. &ldquo;For the love of fate please choose one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora turned to Fool. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a guy, which one looks better on me?&rdquo; said the lilac haired brunette.</p>
<p>Fool  was almost out of his infinite patience. &ldquo;The blue one, and in case you  forgot, Layla&rsquo;s a woman, so I don&rsquo;t think a man&rsquo;s taste counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brunette held the blue one over herself in the mirror. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like the blue one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;aaaaaahhhhh&hellip; fine then, pick the red one.&rdquo; said a mentally exhausted Fool.</p>
<p>Sora held up the red one up in the mirror. &ldquo;That settles it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Fool was relieved this torturous endeavor was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll don&rsquo;t like either of them.&rdquo; said Sora throwing the outfits on the bed and walking towards her suitcase.</p>
<p>Fool fell over on the bed and stared at the ceiling. <strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give anything to switch woman with you Passion.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Hotel room 385</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I&rsquo;ll give anything to switch woman with you Fool.&rdquo; </strong></em>thought an irritated spirit of romance.</p>
<p>Passion  was sitting on the vanity counter filing her nails at a speed that  could cut titanium. She was giving Layla a look that burned with  impatience. The blonde was currently staring at her vast array of  expensive jewelry for the last ten minutes.</p>
<p>Passion looked at the wall clock. <strong><em>&ldquo;Not quite ten minutes yet. 12:39.5.&hellip;12:39.6.&hellip;12:39.7...12.39.8...12.39.9...Now!&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>Layla finally reached over and picked up a thin golden cross her mother gave her and put it around her neck.</p>
<p>Ten  minutes. That was the magic amount of time. For the last half hour  Passion watched Layla go over each article of wardrobe the same way.  The blonde would just sit and stare at each piece she would choose for <em>ten minutes, </em>exactly ten minutes before picking out something. Layla wasn&rsquo;t even aware she was doing it but it was driving Passion nuts.</p>
<p>Passion wasn&rsquo;t the only one going crazy. Macquarie was standing quietly by the bureau stewing. <strong><em>&ldquo;This morning is turning out to be a disaster.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>Watching  her mistress pick out clothes was as irritating for her as it was for  Passion but not for the same reasons. Normally on important luncheons  or meetings that Layla would often go to, Macquarie would be the one to  lay out a nice outfit for Layla to wear but this morning was different.  Even after finding out that her mistress was going on an obvious date  with the oriental girl, she offered to find something nice for Layla to  wear but the blonde refused and said she wanted to pick the clothes out  herself. It was like a slap to Macquarie face, one of the things she  enjoyed doing was taken away, and for what? Because her mistress wanted  to impress Sora? These questions burned inside of her. Macquarie didn&rsquo;t  catch what transpired last night, but it didn&rsquo;t take a whole lot of  brain power to figure out that the shift in her mistress and Sora&rsquo;s  friendship moved into the realm of budding romance. It pained Macquarie  to see her mistress crushing over the Kaleido star and having Layla  spend so much effort on Sora&rsquo;s behalf was rubbing salt in her wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>I have to find a way to put a stop to this or I&rsquo;ll loose her forever.&rdquo; </strong></em></p>
<p>Layla could almost sense the hostility coming off of Macquarie. <strong><em>&ldquo;Maybe its best for Macquarie to take some time off, it&rsquo;s not fare how I treat her, she deserves some relaxation too.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>Layla stopped getting dressed and turned to the maid. &ldquo;Macquarie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you right now, how about you enjoy yourself in town, my treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W..What? I don&rsquo;t need any time off, I&rsquo;m quite happy to be here.&rdquo; said a shocked Macquarie. <strong><em>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good, if I&rsquo;m not around I can&rsquo;t watch them and make sure nothing happens.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Layla  wouldn&rsquo;t book any arguments. &ldquo;I want you to take some personal time off  for awhile, I appreciate your help but it would make me happy to see  you enjoy yourself while we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buts, I insist.&rdquo; said Layla with finality.</p>
<p>Macquarie  sighed and gave in. &ldquo;As you wish mistress.&rdquo; with that said the maid  walked out of the room but before she opened the door Layla stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macquarie&hellip;have fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Layla.&rdquo; said Macquarie as she walked out the door. <strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a way, I wont let you have her Sora.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>A satisfied Layla went back to finishing up her wardrobe selection while Passion watched the whole thing with saddened eyes. <strong><em>&ldquo;Poor  thing, I know its not fare but fate is against you, and I hope you  realize that before you end up hurting the person you care for.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>The  spirit turned back to Layla who was now staring at a vast array of  shoes. &ldquo; Oh for the love of fate, If I had the power to create flames I  would light a fire under your ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla turned and gave Passion  a contemptuous glare. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it your purpose to get me dating and now  your bugging me because I want everything to be perfect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m bugging you because your anal.&rdquo; returned Passion.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Room 386</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; said Sora as she came out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Fool turned to Sora and let out a yelp. &ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it too much?&rdquo; asked an embarrassed Sora.</p>
<p>Fool didn&rsquo;t answer right away, he was too busy staring at Sora low cut blouse. &ldquo;I must say Sora its very becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; said Sora as she followed Fool line of sight. &ldquo;ahhhh, stop that, I knew it was too much, I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sora  turned to go back when a very animated Fool blocked the doorway.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&hellip;. Its fine, in fact my fortune says this outfit will bring you  good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune? I didn&rsquo;t see you read a fortune.&rdquo; mused a skeptical Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was an express fortune, but that not important. You said you wanted to  look nice well I think this qualifies.&rdquo; Fool eyes headed down again. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever seen you show cleavage, and I think its quite  ni&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool didn&rsquo;t get to finish his rambling as Sora grabbed him  and slung him across the room. Sora didn&rsquo;t waste any time grabbing a  white over shirt. After to putting it on she turned to Fool who just  crawled on top of the bed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, I don&rsquo;t think Layla is the  type to appreciate cleavage as much as you Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fool didn&rsquo;t say  anything, he was too busy smiling. Sora didn&rsquo;t notice that the over  shirt buttoned right at the point below the cleavage line and made not  looking at her breasts harder than it was before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows Sora, maybe Layla is the type.&rdquo; said Fool now watching the brunette put on lipstick, another rarity for Sora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  doubt it Fool, she has always been interested in men, and I don&rsquo;t think  she is comfortable exploring what being with another woman means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know Sora, maybe your not the first woman she been attact&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to make me angry Fool?&rdquo; interrupted Sora as she looked at herself one final time in the mirror.</p>
<p>Fool  just snickered. &ldquo;My point is you&rsquo;re a very beautiful woman Sora and you  shouldn&rsquo;t ignore the effect you might have on Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take  that as a compliment if you weren&rsquo;t such a perv.&rdquo; said Sora as she put  on her shoes. &ldquo;You could wish me luck for today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;  said Fool but Sora had already walked into the other room. &ldquo;She might  be the rudest person I ever met.&rdquo; with that said, Fool followed the  brunette.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Room 385</p>
<p>Layla was heading to the door when Passion voice stopped her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what your wearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  turned around puzzled. &ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s wrong with this?&rdquo; The blonde looked  down at her clothes, she was wearing a nice teal dress with expensive  shoes and a modest amount of makeup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look splendid, If your  going to church.&rdquo; said a disapproving spirit of romance. &ldquo;Why not wear  something a little more&hellip;..sultry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suggested Passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what your saying is I should dress more slutty.&rdquo; responded Layla, clearly thinking Passion&rsquo;s suggestion absurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slutty is such a harsh term, I was just thinking you should show off a little more of your feminine charms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Sora is all that interested in my feminine charms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kiss last night told me otherwise madam.&rdquo; said Passion who floated down on the bed and crossed her legs.</p>
<p>Layla looked peeved. &ldquo;You told me you knew about the kiss, you didn&rsquo;t say you watched us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point, the point is Sora is interested in you, and from what I gathered you are interested in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; responded Layla not seeing Passion&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me ask then, last night when you kissed Sora, how did it make you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla was considering to ignore the question but she decided to answer honestly. &ldquo;Warm&hellip;no on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; questioned Passion.</p>
<p>Layla shook her head. &ldquo;It also made me feel desired and wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; said a triumphant Passion. &ldquo;It made you feel wanted and desired, those weren&rsquo;t your feelings, those were Sora&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla took a second to consider that. &ldquo;So your saying that Sora&rsquo;s physically attracted to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it was obvious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that Sora may be looking at her like that made Layla nervous.</p>
<p>Passion  sensed Layla&rsquo;s feelings and decided to try some levity to make her feel  better. &ldquo;I know this is all new and scary for you but you need to have  faith in your feelings or its going to be tough to woo her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes  as in the process of wooing, as in making someone fall in love with  you.&rdquo; explained Passion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think just because you and Sora have  sparks you can easily start a fire. You have to fan the flames of  desire to make her yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla cheek darkened a little. &ldquo;What do you mean by making her mine?&rdquo; said Layla in a near whisper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion  started laughing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking  about.&rdquo; the spirit waited for her laughing to stop before she  continued. &ldquo;In plain terms I meant, making love, sex, intercourse,  woohoo, horizontal mambo, scre&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo; interrupted a  shocked Layla. &ldquo;I just started to like Sora more than a friend and in  no way am I even thinking about that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit started  laughing again. &ldquo;Maybe you weren&rsquo;t before but now you will, funny thing  about mentioning something someone didn&rsquo;t consider, after that its all  they can think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may disappoint a perverted elf like  yourself but I have more control over my thoughts than you think.&rdquo; said  Layla as she turned and walked out of the room, but she forgot her  purse and walked back in. Passion was still talking but she ignored her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have you know that I&rsquo;m a spirit not an elf, elves don&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; fumed a  now unlaughing Passion. &ldquo;Are you listening to me?&rdquo; said the spirit  after she didn&rsquo;t get a response. &ldquo;Madam you are rudest person I&rsquo;ve ever  known.&rdquo; huffed Passion.</p>
<p>The blonde, having finally found her purse, walked back out of the room when her thoughts began to wander. &ldquo;<strong><em>If me and Sora begin dating then I guess its logical that someday we might&hellip;..oh no&hellip;&hellip;.. dam you Passion.&rdquo; </em></strong></p>
<p>Instead  of heading to Sora&lsquo;s room, the blushing Layla walked back into her room  where she grabbed a pillow and threw it at Passion. The spirit saw it  coming and floated out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that is some blush you  have madam, you wouldn&rsquo;t happened to have had naughty thoughts now  would you.&rdquo; jested Passion as she broke out in a whole new round of  giggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I should go over and get her?&rdquo; mused Sora  but her decision was cut off at the sound of someone knocking at the  door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her.&rdquo; said the brunette as she did a quick check in  the mirror. When she came out she eyed Fool. &ldquo;You behave yourself, if  Layla found out you were here it would make her feel bad she couldn&rsquo;t  see you anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll behave.&rdquo; answered Fool in way that meant he was going to do the opposite.</p>
<p>Sora was about to say something more but when another knock came from the door she decided it was time to make her appearance.</p>
<p>When  the Kaleido star opened the door she was greeted with the sight of a  nervous but very beautiful looking Layla. She was so attractive Sora  forgot to greet the blonde.</p>
<p>The blonde stood there looking at  Sora who was frozen in place just staring at her. Layla would have  broken the silence but her gaze wandered down below Sora neckline and  her blood pressure began to rise. Sora was wearing a white blouse over  a very low cut shirt and it took Layla a second to realize this was the  same Sora she always knew. This must have been the first time she saw  the Japanese girl wear something this revealing which said a lot after  all the outfits they had to wear at the Kaleido stage.</p>
<p>Passion  and Fool were floating between the two woman very amused. Fool cursed  himself for not having a camera. It wasn&rsquo;t everyday a dressed up Sora  was drooling over Layla while the blonde was staring at her breasts.  Passion may have liked the stare fest to continue but she didn&rsquo;t want  to have the two girls get embarrassed when they realized what they were  doing. She floated up to Layla ear. &ldquo;It not polite to stare madam,  perhaps a greeting would be more appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That snapped Layla out of her trance. She forced herself to look Sora in the eyes. &ldquo;Good afternoon Sora.&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>Coming to her senses Sora answered the blonde. &ldquo;Good afternoon Layla, are you ready to go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  nodded and stepped back to allow Sora&rsquo;s exit. The brunette shut her  door and the two walked towards the elevator. The spirits were about to  follow when Macquarie&rsquo;s door opened. The woman that left the maids room  had black hair and nice dress on, she didn&rsquo;t appear to be in a hurry  but she did keep pace with Layla and Sora. Fool and Passion looked at  one another. &ldquo;This is getting interesting.&rdquo; said the spirits at the  same time.</p>
<p><u>To be continued.</u> More to come soon, sorry again for the long wait.</p>
