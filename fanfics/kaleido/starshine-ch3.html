<a href="../kaleido/starshine-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Sora and Layla waved goodbye as Cathy drove off.  Sora wondered out 
loud, &quot;I don&#39;t understand what she said, but it sure sounded pretty.&quot;

Layla paused and pondered at Cathy&#39;s prose.  She thought, &quot;Cathy reads 
people very well... I think I&#39;m beginning to understand what she meant.  
But she obviously knows something that I don&#39;t.&quot;  Layla&#39;s lips drew to a 
taut line.  &quot;I&#39;ll just have to adlib.&quot;  She turned to Sora.  &quot;How&#39;s your 
sea legs, Sora?&quot;

Sora&#39;s eyes widened in realization.  &quot;They&#39;re as good as ever, captain.&quot;

Layla smiled warmly.  &quot;Good.  You&#39;ll be needing them.&quot;

They check out a yacht from the caretakers and set out of the harbor.  
Sora watched as Layla manned the helm.  &quot;I didn&#39;t know you can sail, 
Layla.&quot;

&quot;I learned in between rehearsals.  The schedule isn&#39;t as hectic as 
Kaleido Stage&#39;s.&quot;

Layla sailed to a good anchor point and set the anchor down.  She 
invited Sora to watch the sunset with her.  They exchanged very few 
words as they watched the sun set together.  After the sun had set, a 
boat  sailed to their side.  Cathy waved from the other side.  &quot;I&#39;ve got 
some stuff for you!&quot;  Cathy came aboard with a crew man and brought a 
few bags with them.  Sora recognized her duffle bag as Cathy handed it 
to her.  &quot;Sarah helped me pick these.  I hope that&#39;s fine with you.&quot;  

&quot;Umm... yes... thank you.&quot;  Sora accepted the bag gratefully.  The scent 
of chicken wafted through the air.  She turned around to see the crew 
man unpacking food on the coffee table.  &quot;Wow.&quot; 

When he was done, Cathy turned to Layla and Sora.  &quot;Well, then, maybe 
I&#39;ll see you both tomorrow?&quot;  

&quot;Maybe.&quot;  replied Layla.  She smiled gratefully.  &quot;And thanks for all 
your help.&quot;

&quot;No thanks needed.  I&#39;m having fun too.&quot;  Cathy smirked mischievously.  
&quot;Anyway, good night, ladies!&quot;  With that, Cathy returned to the other 
boat.  

Layla waved back.  &quot;I bet you are.&quot;  thought Layla.  When the boat was 
out of sight, she turned to Sora.  &quot;Dinner?&quot;

&quot;After you, captain!&quot;  said Sora brightly.

As they sat down for dinner, Sora noticed a pair of lit candles and wine 
glasses along with the appetizing entrees.  The cabin&#39;s lights were 
dimmed as well.  It all seemed strangely romantic.  They ate dinner 
quietly.  Sora was so happy to be dining with Layla, and she didn&#39;t want 
to say anything to spoil the mood.  &quot;Tonight, it&#39;s just me and Layla.&quot;  
she thought.  Yuuri&#39;s proposal and Ken&#39;s confession weighed heavily in 
her mind.  &quot;Nothing will come out of worrying about it right now.&quot;  she 
consoled herself.  &quot;Who knows what will happen in the future.  But for 
now, all I can see is you.  I don&#39;t know how long this moment will last, 
but I&#39;m grateful that you chose to spend it with me.&quot;  She pushed her 
doubts aside.  All that mattered was that Layla was here with her, and 
only her.

When they finished, they put the dishes away.  Layla gestured to the 
bathroom.  &quot;Feel free to take a shower.&quot;

When Sora heard shower, she instantly looked around the cabin and in the 
bathroom.  &quot;I hope he didn&#39;t stow away...&quot;  Sora thought.

Layla was perplexed with Sora&#39;s behavior.  &quot;What are you looking for 
Sora?&quot;

Sora cupped her fist into her palm. &quot;Oh that&#39;s right!&quot;  She turned to 
Layla.  &quot;If you see Fool, let me know right away!&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;He always tries to watch me shower.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;  What Sora said began to sink in.  &quot;What?!  But doesn&#39;t he just 
pass through walls and stuff?&quot;

&quot;No, he can&#39;t.  That&#39;s why we have to catch him if he&#39;s here.&quot;

&quot;In that case, go and shower.  I&#39;ll guard the door.&quot;

With that, they took turns showering and guarding.  When they were 
finished and dressed, Layla asked, &quot;Do you want to view the stars?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;d love to.&quot;  

&quot;In that case, help me with the telescope.&quot;  Layla opened a cabinet and 
gestured to a high performance telescope.  Together, they brought it to 
the upper deck and set it up.  Layla showed Sora how to adjust the lens 
and identified several constellations.

&quot;Do you know where Sagittarius and Leo are?&quot;  asked Sora.

&quot;Yes.  Sagittarius is over here... and Leo is... over there...&quot;  Layla 
directed Sora to point at the appropriate location.  They looked at a 
few more stars until Layla began to yawn.  &quot;Oh, pardon me...&quot;

Layla guessed that her medication was making her a bit sleepy.

Sora noticed the yawn.  &quot;Why don&#39;t we go down and get ready for bed?&quot;

Layla sat up.  &quot;That&#39;s a great idea!&quot;

They put away the telescope.  Then they proceeded to change for bed.  
Layla opened the suitcase that Cathy left in the cabin at the upper deck 
and looked for something to wear for bed.  She found her favorite style 
of negligee and remembered the look on Sora&#39;s face when she wore it in 
her room.  Suddenly, a thought struck her and she looked around for 
Fool.  She realized now that when Sora asked her not to wear the 
negligee, she was trying to protect her from Fool&#39;s prying eyes.  
&quot;Hah... and I thought it was only you who would see me in it...&quot;  she 
ran her hand over the negligee.  &quot;Only you...&quot;  Layla undressed and put 
on the negligee.  She thought about Fool&#39;s card and the connection to 
Yuuri&#39;s proposal and Ken&#39;s behavior.  The possibilities indicated by the 
card cast a shadow over her heart, but Cathy&#39;s soliloquy seems to 
suggest another path.  &quot;Which path is it?&quot;  Layla asked herself.  She 
closed her eyes and imagined, &quot;What&#39;s at the end of the path?  What will 
I find there... no... what do I want to find there?  Fortune be damned!  
I have always set my goals to my future self.  And this time, the future 
I want, is a future with...&quot;

A knock on the door interrupted her reverie.  Layla opened the door.  
&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I just wanted to wish you good night.  And thank you for star gazing 
with me.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  You&#39;re welcome.&quot;  An idea popped into her head.  &quot;Since you like 
star gazing, let me show you something.&quot;  Layla drew Sora into the cabin 
and closed the door behind her.  She grabbed a remote control and 
motioned Sora to sit on the bed.  &quot;Please sit down.&quot;  Sora obeyed and 
Layla sat next to her.  With the remote, she turned off the lights in 
the cabin and turned on the converter.  There was a clicking noise and 
the ceiling of the cabin split in half lengthwise.  The ceiling and 
sides folded themselves along the walls of the cabin.  When the 
mechanisms stopped, the cabin gave a breath taking view of the night 
sky.  

&quot;Wow!&quot;  said Sora as she gazed at the sky.  She turned to Layla.  &quot;This 
is great, Layla!  You can just sit here and watch the sky.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t it?  Father had the cabin modified for me.&quot;  As Layla looked into 
Sora&#39;s eyes, she was struck by the sudden luminance and depth of Sora&#39;s 
eyes.  She gazed with bewilderment at those eyes shining like golden 
brown plates against the backdrop of a silver moon behind Sora.  

As she wondered if Fool was playing tricks with her eyes, Sora murmured, 
&quot;You&#39;re so radiant tonight, Layla.&quot; 

It was then that she realized that she was seeing her own reflection 
within Sora&#39;s eyes.  Layla&#39;s eyes softened as she said, &quot;That&#39;s 
because... you&#39;re here.&quot;  Sora&#39;s eyes grew wide and Layla smiled gently 
as she caressed Sora&#39;s cheek.  &quot;Don&#39;t you see?  It&#39;s your star that 
shines in me.&quot;  Sora blushed and Layla&#39;s fingertips delighted at her 
warmth.  &quot;When you shine, I shine as well.  And when I shine, you do as 
well.&quot;

Not knowing what to do, Sora just stared at Layla.  The light from the 
moon illuminated Layla as if she were a goddess.  The moonlight made her 
damp hair glisten and shine.  Her skin radiated with a pale glow.  

&quot;Are you still unsure?&quot;  Layla took Sora&#39;s hand and laid it on her 
cheek.  Sora&#39;s hand felt warm against her cheek, and she felt her own 
cheek respond in kind.  Layla whispered, &quot;I&#39;m here, right now.  How can 
I shine like this without you?  Without... my partner?&quot;

Sora&#39;s eyes began to fill with tears.  Her hand slipped down to Layla&#39;s 
shoulder and closed with a gentle pull.  Layla understood the movement 
with intuitive ease, and pulled Sora close to her that a sudden shudder 
rushed through her spine.

&quot;Is something wrong, Layla-san?&quot;  Sora felt Layla tremble slightly in 
her arms.  She relaxed her hold on Layla, but Layla drew her back.  

&quot;It&#39;s nothing... it&#39;s just that... this feels so... familiar.&quot;  Layla 
smiled inwardly with nostalgia as she remembered how they held each 
other as the boat rocked on the open sea.  And then she recalled the 
conversation they had before they went to bed.  She leaned back and 
pulled Sora with her onto the bed.  Sora gasped as they plopped down on 
the covers.  Layla cupped Sora&#39;s chin.  &quot;You stole something from me, so 
I&#39;m going to take something from you.&quot;

&quot;Eh?!  What did I steal?&quot;

&quot;My heart.&quot;  With that Layla captured Sora&#39;s lips.  The pressure of 
Sora&#39;s lips upon her own was almost electric.  It spurred her on and she 
kissed with all the raging fire since their last night on a boat.  &quot;I 
have made my leap towards my future... will you catch me or will I 
fall?&quot;, she thought as she released Sora and drew back to see Sora&#39;s 
reaction.

Sora was too stunned to think.  A bright light had enveloped her and she 
was overwhelmed by its warmth.  As she floated within the light, a 
outline of a person appeared before her.  A hand extended as if it were 
waiting to be received in midair.  Sora instinctively reached out and 
grabbed the person&#39;s wrist.  She pulled the person up and into an 
embrace.  The brightness faded and she heard someone calling her name.  
She opened her eyes and beheld Layla&#39;s concerned face.  She caressed 
Layla&#39;s face to convince herself that she wasn&#39;t dreaming.  Soon, she 
regained her senses.  &quot;Layla kissed me.  Me.  Of all people.&quot;  she 
thought happily.  She thought of all the times they practiced and 
performed together.  She remembered the feeling as she flew with Layla 
during the Mystical Act.  Her eyes wandered to Layla&#39;s injured shoulder 
and back to Layla&#39;s face.  &quot;I have to do something.&quot;  Sora leaned 
forward and kissed Layla&#39;s shoulder.  

Layla was startled at Sora&#39;s action.  &quot;Sora?&quot;  

&quot;Marion said that in the US, if you kiss a booboo it will get better 
soon.&quot;  explained Sora.  &quot;I want it to get better soon, so we can be 
partners forever.&quot;

Relief flooded Layla&#39;s face and she felt the joyous sting of tears well 
up in her eyes.  &quot;We don&#39;t have to wait for my shoulder to heal to do 
that.  We can become partners forever anytime!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;  She held Sora closer.  &quot;Have you ever been to Boston?&quot;

&quot;When we go there, we can make our partnership official.&quot;

&quot;Wow!  Let&#39;s go there tomorrow!&quot;

Layla chuckled at Sora&#39;s enthusiasm.  She cupped Sora&#39;s face in her 
hand.  &quot;But first... we have a performance to fin-- mmmph!!!&quot;  Layla was 
surprised at Sora&#39;s sudden kiss.  It was abrupt but playful.

Sora drew back.  &quot;I dare you to catch me, pirate.&quot;  she whispered.

&quot;I accept your challenge!&quot;  Layla captured Sora&#39;s lips again.  &quot;Now, 
you&#39;re mine!&quot;  she declared to herself.

Together they staged a performance for an audience no other than 
themselves.  It was a performance filled with daring, of desire, of 
passion and excitement.  Their breathing rose and fell with reassuring 
movements which traced spirals and patterns across their stage.   When 
their hearts began to beat as one, they rose higher and higher to 
finally explode in a shower of stars which gathered together to form a 
bridge between their souls.

&quot;And thus was the prediction fulfilled.&quot; said Fool who confirmed the 
fortune with his crystal ball.  &quot; And as for your future... together you 
will fly with the stars above.&quot;
