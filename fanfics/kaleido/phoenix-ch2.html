<p>Thoughts are in italic</p>
<p>Flashbacks are in bold italic</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean the spirit of romance?&rdquo; questioned Layla, to say she was  shocked by the fairies presence was an understatement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said  madam I am Passion the spirit of romance and I&rsquo;ve come to show you the  path to true happiness.&rdquo; said the spirit as she spun around for  dramatic effect and this was when Layla first noticed the spirit spoke  with a French accent.</p>
<p>Layla couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was seeing.  Sure she met the spirit of the stage, but for some reason this spirit,  who appeared much less severe, was all the more imposing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m familiar  with spirits, but why is the spirit of romance appearing before me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion  was surprised at the mention of another spirit but she decided to  explain her presence. &ldquo;I appear before destined souls and guide them to  true happiness, and I&rsquo;ve a come to you because a soul can travel  through this world many times and never find their soul mates, and you  are fortunate enough to have fate guide you to yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you trying to tell me your fate?&rdquo; said a now skeptical Layla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  but you could say I work for fate. All spirits in the universe work for  fate, well that&rsquo;s not entirely true, the spirit of fortune works for  himself, but don&lsquo;t get me started on him.&rdquo; Passion took a second to  calm down then continued. &ldquo;To get back on to topic, you were in serious  danger of passing up your one true love and fate decided to step in and  give you a push in the right direction. That&rsquo;s where I come in, patron  of everlasting romance at your service&rdquo; said the fairy with another  curtsy.</p>
<p>The shock of seeing the spirit finally wore off and Layla  was now angry for Passion&rsquo;s unwanted appearance. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t care what  you are, but I have to meet someone at the airport very soon and I&rsquo;d  appreciate it if you would go back where you came from. I don&rsquo;t need  some spirit of romance trying to play matchmaker for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh and  why not madam?&rdquo; said an amused Passion. She really did like it when her  charges were spitfires, It made her time all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I choose where, when, and who I fall in love, and I don&rsquo;t need some lackey of fate deciding that for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s already out of your hands madam.&rdquo; said Passion knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you saying I&rsquo;m in love already?&rdquo; questioned Layla.</p>
<p>&ldquo; That&rsquo;s not for me to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you always this vague?&rdquo; said Layla who was now growing irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being  vague is part of my job description madam, I&rsquo;m not here to interfere  only to guide and when its needed I push everything in the right  direction.&rdquo; said Passion with a certain haughtiness.</p>
<p>Layla didn&lsquo;t  like the sound of that. She wasn&rsquo;t enthusiastic about having a spirit  meddling around with her love life, a non existent one at that. &ldquo;I  think your presence here is pointless, I would be the first one to know  if I was in love, so having a spirit of romance around seems rather  useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit had to laugh at that. &ldquo;Are you telling me your not interested in anyone Ms. Hamilton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passion got a mischievous gleam in her eye. &ldquo;How about hmm&hellip; ah yes, perhaps your old partner Yuri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know for sure Yuri is not my soul mate.&rdquo; said a shocked Layla. &ldquo;Sure we  went out a few times, but there weren&rsquo;t any sparks between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not Yuri?&rdquo; asked Passion as she put her hands behind her back and strolled about the vanity desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Layla with finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please  forgive me madam I&rsquo;m usually quite good at this.&rdquo; It was rather clear  that Passion was playing her. &ldquo;Well then let me see&hellip;. How about Jacob  from Broadway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? Just because we had to kiss on  stage doesn&rsquo;t mean I liked him, and for your information he was horrid  kisser.&rdquo; said Layla. She was tired of playing this game and was growing  even more irritated by the second.</p>
<p>Sensing she may have pushed  her luck, Passion ventured one more time. &ldquo;I see my intuition is not  what it used to be but if I was to make on more guess I would say it  was the person you were selecting your wardrobe for earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  enough!&rdquo; Layla finally had enough of this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know that the  person I&rsquo;m meeting at the airport is a very good friend of mine and she  is also a SHE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit stopped her pacing and smiled  knowingly. &ldquo;A woman you say, hmmm&hellip;. perhaps I was mistaken. I guess a  woman wouldn&rsquo;t know how to return another woman&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; said Passion  sarcastically. &ldquo;Please excuse me madam but I don&rsquo;t want to keep you any  longer if you don&rsquo;t leave soon you will be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not missing the  spirit&rsquo;s sarcastic tone, but not wanting to argue anymore, Layla turned  around and stared at the clock. Passion was right, if Layla didn&rsquo;t  leave soon she would be late. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind I have to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layla  went to choose an outfit, but the spirit&rsquo;s words still unsettled her so  she grabbed the nearest one and started to get dressed. Before she  removed her towel she looked over her shoulder. Sitting atop her makeup  case was the still present spirit. Instead of leaving, Passion made  herself comfortable and started staring at Layla lecherously. Layla was  wondering why the spirit was still there &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there  something wrong madam? There is nothing to be shy about. We are both  woman after all so please continue.&rdquo; said Passion with an extremely  seductive smile plastered on her face.</p>
<p>Layla didn&rsquo;t say anything at all, it was then Passion noticed her left eye started twitching.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Five minutes later</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out right now, you can&rsquo;t treat a lady like this.&rdquo; yelled Passion from inside the vanities cabinet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  be quiet, I&rsquo;ll let you out when I&rsquo;m finished.&rdquo; said Layla as she  finished zipping up her skirt. The knocking from the cabinet only got  louder &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, your worst than Fool.&rdquo; at the mention of  Fool&rsquo;s name the pounding stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you just say Fool.&rdquo; asked Passion from inside her makeshift wooden prison. &ldquo;As in the spirit of the &hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stage?  Yes I know him, and just like him your both annoy&hellip;.&rdquo; Layla started to  say but stopped when she turned around and saw Passion sitting atop the  vanity again. &ldquo;How did you get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lets just say I was properly motivated. Now answer me, how do you know Fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry this conversation is over, I have to go.&rdquo; and with that said,  Layla grabbed her purse and headed out of the hotel room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, MADAM!&rdquo; yelled Passion at the retreating woman. &ldquo;Sacrebleu! Why do I always get the difficult ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Layla&rsquo;s car stuck in traffic thirty minutes later.</p>
<p>Layla  was unsettled after her visit from the spirit of romance. She didn&rsquo;t  have time to think about it when she was rushing to the airport but now  with her car stuck in the middle of traffic she didn&rsquo;t have any other  choice but to go over the night&rsquo;s events in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I can&rsquo;t  believe the audacity of that spirit. My fate is my own and I refuse to  believe I have no choice on who my destined someone is.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>This is ridiculous, why can&rsquo;t I decide on one? I&rsquo;m just picking up Sora so why does it even matter?&rdquo; </strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>Because you want to look your best when meeting the one that sets your body aflame.&rdquo; </strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Why  was I so worried about what I looked like, and why am I so nervous  about seeing Sora again? This isn&rsquo;t like me, I don&rsquo;t get nervous about  seeing anyone let alone Sora of all people. Stop it Layla, your  thoughts are just wondering. If that annoying spirit hadn&rsquo;t put those  thoughts into your head everything would be fine. I&rsquo;ll Just forget what  she said. It doesn&rsquo;t do me any good thinking about it now&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The  traffic started moving again and Layla was given renewed hope that she  would make it on time. She decided it would be quicker if she turned  off onto the freeway and went to the airport that way. It was a gamble  trying a road she had never been on before but she didn&rsquo;t have any  other choice. This was unfamiliar territory and she would have to try  her best.</p>
<p>A small opening appeared between the traffic and she  had to make it quick before it closed. This was the best time to put  her Mustang GT convertible to the test. Layla stepped on the gas and  flew across the lanes at neck breaking speed dodging a minivan and an  eighteen wheeler. The run was smooth and perfect, and Layla was happy  her reflexes were still honed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>If the surgery doesn&rsquo;t work out maybe I&rsquo;ll try my hand at race car driving.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Layla&rsquo;s  thoughts were cut short by the presence of flickering lights in her  rear view mirror. She had the mind to ignore the lights and floor it  but the quick on and off sound of a siren destroyed that idea. Layla  had no choice but to pull over. &ldquo;Could this day get any better.&rdquo; said  Layla as she looked at herself in the mirror. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s degrading  but lets just get this over with, a quick flirt and he&rsquo;ll let me go  with a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;License an registration please.&rdquo; said the female police officer as she approached the window.</p>
<p>Layla sighed. &ldquo;Figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ll never forget this day as long as I live.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p align="center">Flight 101 circling Boston Logan International</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ll never forget this day as long as I live.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Sora  couldn&rsquo;t believe she got bumped to first class. She&rsquo;d flown many times  in an airplane but she had never experienced flying first class before.  Sora was always a firm believer in flying conservatively so she never  opted to get a first class booking. When they announced that they would  be pulling people from other parts of the plane to fill some first  class seats, Sora was pleasantly surprised she was chosen, and for the  duration of the flight she felt like a queen, especially with flight  attendants waiting on constantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>So this is what Layla gets  to feel like coming from such a wealthy family, but who am I kidding,  Layla-san is the type of person that likes to do things for herself. I  remember when she made us coffee over a month ago, and Its to bad I can  still taste it, but at least she tried and that&rsquo;s what counts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Attention  everybody, we are on final approach to Logan International. Fasten your  seat belts and make sure your seats and tray tables are in their  up-right, locked position.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s a shame this has to end but at least I&rsquo;ll see be seeing Layla soon.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">Airport after landing</p>
<p>The  flight was actually quite refreshing for Sora. She got off the plane  and headed strait for the baggage claim. Sora wasn&rsquo;t sure about what to  do next. The only details she got from Kalos was to arrive at this  airport and wait outside of terminal G. &ldquo;I wonder were she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When ten minutes passed and no sign of anyone appeared, Sora became a little worried.</p>
<p>People,  nothing but an ocean of people greeted Layla when she arrived at the  terminal G. One face after another passed by with no sign of Sora.  Layla cursed herself for not arriving sooner. Had she not been late,  she would have been able to see the incoming passengers as they  arrived, and that would have made it much easier to spot the lavender  haired Kaleido star.</p>
<p>Layla walked over and leaned against one of  the support columns and let out an epic sigh. If she had been a smoker,  she would have it up right there and then, the rules be damned.</p>
<p>The  day had been a quagmire and Layla was about fed up with it. First with  the arrival of Passion then the police officer and now this. If one  thing could be said about Layla Hamilton, it would be that she could  always maintain graceful elegance in all of her pursuits whether it be  performing acrobatic stunts or doing everyday things like walking. This  could not be used to describe Layla today. It seemed every event today  one after the other was designed to knock Layla out of her poise.</p>
<p>Taking  a deep breath Layla calmed herself and regained a measure of her  sanity. &ldquo;The sooner I find Sora the better off I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; with that  Layla moved away from the column and resumed her search.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Sora was starting to get worried. <em>&ldquo;Maybe something happened to her?&rdquo; </em>It  was almost as if Sora could sense Layla was somewhere in distress. Sora  decided it was best if she called to make sure everything was alright.  Just when Sora turned to the pay phone area a flash of gold caught her  eye. Right next to a support column was a woman with bright golden hair  that started moving to the baggage claim area.</p>
<p>A wave of relief  passed through Sora. Even though the blonde haired woman was facing  away from her, Sora could tell it Layla. Her hair was much longer since  the last time she&rsquo;d seen her, It now came down to her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip; she&rsquo;s as elegant as always.&rdquo; thought Sora as she noted Layla&rsquo;s confident walk and poise.</p>
<p>Barely  keeping her excitement to herself, Sora quickened her pace to a near  run. It wasn&rsquo;t easy getting to where Layla was, it seemed the universe  was playing tricks on her because the closer she got to her destination  the thicker the crowd got.</p>
<p>Sora decided to whip out a move from  her acrobatic arsenal and did a back flip and a spin over the crowd.  The move would have been flawless but when she landed near Layla she  stepped in a puddle of liquid that someone spelt causing her to lose  balance. Sora tried in vain to stable herself but she ended up slipping  forward headlong into the unexpecting former Kaleido star.</p>
<p align="center">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Layla  began to think that maybe Sora&rsquo;s flight had been delayed. Right when  Layla turned to the counter to check the flights something crashed into  her causing her to fall backwards. When the vertigo and shock wore off  Layla looked up to see what hit her she gasped out in surprise.</p>
<p>Layla&rsquo;s  sky blue orbs met Sora&rsquo;s warm chocolate ones. Both woman were frozen in  time. Their breath&rsquo;s mingled warmly from lips no more than a few  centimeters apart. In the passing of a fleeting moment Layla realized  just who she was staring at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name escaped from Layla's lips in the faintest of whispers. Only to be answered back just as quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be continued, well duh, if I didn&rsquo;t I would be a real ass</p>
