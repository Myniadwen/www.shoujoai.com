<h1>Farewell</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundamseed/index.html">Gundam Seed</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Dialog bits were lifted from Gundam Seed Manga #4. This also contains 
spoilers if you haven&#39;t seen the later episodes...


Natarle Badgiruel looked down at her captain in shock as the black 
haired woman blinked in surprise, &quot;Huh?&quot;

Captain Murrue Ramus looked up at her from where she was seated at her 
desk with a certain degree of amusement as she said, &quot;Headquarters just 
sent me word that you&#39;re being transferred.&quot; The dark brown haired woman 
stood up as she met her second in command&#39;s stunned gaze and continued, 
&quot;Apparently, you&#39;re getting a special promotion. They&#39;re making you the 
captain of a new ship.&quot;

&quot;Me...?&quot; Natarle breathed out, the lifelong military officer&#39;s eyes 
filled with joy.

Murrue offered her hand as she warmly said, &quot;Congratulations.&quot;

Natarle took it firmly, smiling a she breathed out, &quot;Th... thank you.&quot;

&quot;Good luck, Lt. Commander Badgiruel,&quot; Murrue said quietly.

&quot;Captain Ramus...&quot; Natarle started, then hesitated.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Murrue asked, her expression curious.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Natarle quicky said, flushing. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said as she 
hurried out of the office with surprising haste.

&#39;I wonder what that was about?&#39; Murrue thought to herself quizzically 
before returning to her work. Later on the bridge she nodded to the 
young men and women there, feeling a slight pang at realizing they&#39;d be 
gone soon, too. &#39;It&#39;s for the best,&#39; she mused, knowing that her 
volunteer staff would soon be replaced by Earth Alliance soldiers.

Entering the bridge Mu La Flaga made quite a dashing figure, and Murrue 
had to smile slightly as he effortlessly charmed the ladies. &quot;So, how 
did Natarle take the news?&quot; he asked her, smiling warmly as he stood 
beside her.

&quot;Surprised,&quot; Murrue smiled slightly in reply, &quot;but in a good way.&quot; She 
frowned, thinking of Natarle&#39;s odd moment of hesitation.

Mu gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I almost thought Natarle was going to say something more,&quot; Murrue 
admitted after a moment, &quot;then she left.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not the type to hesitate,&quot; Mu frowned after a moment&#39;s thought. 
Looking forward he mused, &quot;She&#39;s leaving soon...&quot;

Murrue nodded slightly, quickly making a decision. &quot;You have the 
bridge,&quot; she addressed the senior officer, turning and hurrying off.

In her quarters Natarle finished packing, sweeping the room with her 
eyes to make sure she had all her personal effects. The spartan quarters 
were largely unchanged by her living there for so long, but Natarle knew 
she would miss it, a little.

The chime rang and Natarle looked up with a frown, &quot;Yes?&quot;

The door opened quietly and Murrue entered the room, the other woman 
looking around her curiously before meeting Natarle&#39;s surprised gaze. &quot;I 
wanted to see you before you left,&quot; she nervously explained.

&quot;Captain,&quot; Natarle nodded respectfully.

&quot;Murrue,&quot; she corrected her firmly, &quot;you may still be on my ship, but 
you&#39;re no longer under my command.&quot;

Natarle hesitated, &quot;I doubt the military would see it that way.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Murrue sat down on the bed, &quot;we both know I&#39;ve never been the 
spit and polish military type you&#39;d have preferred.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not entirely true,&quot; Natarle admitted after a moment, &quot;you have 
a... bond with the crew I envy, honestly.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Murrue said wryly. Looking up at Natarle she said quietly, 
&quot;Back in my office, what were you going to say?&quot;

Natarle looked startled, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

Murrue looked at her seriously, &quot;Natarle, we&#39;re in the middle of a 
war... it&#39;s quite possible I&#39;ll never have the chance to ask again.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; Natarle shook her head firmly, clearly distressed by 
the idea.

&quot;Natarle, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Murrue asked softly, reaching out to lay a 
hand on her arm.

Taking off her uniform cap Natarle pushed her hair back from her eyes, 
studying Murrue with a intense look. &quot;Did you mean it when you said I&#39;m 
no longer under your command?&quot; she asked Murrue.

Murrue looked at her curiously, &quot;Yes...?&quot;

Natarle leaned forward, gently pressing her lips to the surprised 
Murrue&#39;s. Pulling back she smiled, &quot;Because there is no way I&#39;d do that 
to a commanding officer.&quot;

&quot;You... I...&quot; Murrue looked mildly stunned, a remarkably cute look for 
her. &quot;I thought you liked Mu?&quot; she managed.

Natarle chuckled softly, &quot;No, I like him but not... that way.&quot; She 
looked at Murrue questioningly, &quot;You&#39;re... all right about this?&quot;

Murrue looked at her wryly, &quot;I&#39;m a bit surprised... why didn&#39;t you say 
anything to me before now?&quot;

Natarle shrugged slightly, &quot;I&#39;m career military, Murrue. It wouldn&#39;t 
help my chances of promotion if this ever got out...&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Murrue agreed wryly, knowing her own preference for the 
technical side of fleet operations kept her relatively safe from such 
concerns.

Natarle gently reached out to stroke her cheek as she told Murrue, &quot;I&#39;ve 
admired you a long time, you know.&quot;

Murrue hesitated, &quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot;

Natarle drew her hand back, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot;

Murrue caught her hand, cradling it in hers as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
done this before, but I&#39;m certainly willing to try.&quot;

Natarle grinned with a surprising degree of roguishness, &quot;Are you sure 
you want to risk it? You might never want to go back.&quot;

Murrue smiled as she kissed Natarle lingeringly, &quot;Oh, I think I&#39;ll 
chance it.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go,&quot; Natarle sighed afterward, very reluctantly pulling 
away from Murrue&#39;s naked body.

&quot;I know,&quot; Murrue agreed, getting up too and stretching languidly. She 
smiled at Natarle, &quot;You know, I think I&#39;ll miss you.&quot;

&quot;Because of this?&quot; Natarle asked as she got dressed.

&quot;No, because of all our arguments,&quot; Murrue teased. A bit more seriously 
she said, &quot;You&#39;ve been a good friend, Natarle. I won&#39;t forget that.&quot;

Natarle nodded as she met Murrue&#39;s gaze, &quot;And I won&#39;t forget you.&quot; She 
stepped close and kissed her gently in farewell, &quot;Good luck, Captain.&quot;

&quot;Good luck, Lieutenant Commander Badgiruel,&quot; Murrue answered softly as 
Natarle finished dressing and hurried from the room.

End

Notes: I always felt sorta sorry for Natarle, considering her ultimate 
fate in Seed. She also lacks romance, tho I understand in a game based 
off Seed she&#39;s interested in Mu, so I tossed a reference to that in too. 
Not canon at all, and she&#39;s not gay in the series. lol
