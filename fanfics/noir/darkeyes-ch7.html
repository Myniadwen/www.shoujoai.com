<h1>The Darkness in Their Eyes (part 7 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rtraverse.html">Rune Traverse</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Early the next morning, Kirika made her way to the small riverbank 
boutique mall where she&#39;d met with Alexander, looking intently for that 
familiar lanky frame and head of nut-brown hair. Sunlight bathed 
everything in a golden glow, sparkling off the water while birds swooped 
and darted through the treetops; even a few small squirrels and 
chipmunks appeared in the warm green grass, little noses and fluffy 
tails twitching as they hunted for nuts along the dirt. It would be a 
perfect day for sketching, but right now, the young woman had more 
personal business at hand.

&quot;Kirika!&quot;

Her intuition had been right, then. Kirika turned, her trademark smile 
curving up the corners of her lips. As though her thoughts had summoned 
him to this spot, Alexander jogged up, grinning from ear to ear. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d see you again.&quot; He seemed rather gleeful, giving her 
a quick, one-armed hug around the shoulders before pulling back to look 
her up and down. &quot;Well, you look like you&#39;re happy, so I&#39;m guessing you 
and Mirelle didn&#39;t have some big knock-down, drag-out fight over 
yesterday. Was she really mad?&quot;

Kirika nodded slightly, her eyes dancing just a bit. Mad or even really 
mad was a bit of an understatement. Mirelle had been absolutely livid 
when the taxi she&#39;d picked up had finally reached the street corner. Oh, 
not at Kirika, although the young woman had feared that. Her rage had 
been directed entirely at the goons and whoever had hired them. She&#39;d 
been snarling, barely keeping her voice down, alternating between firing 
questions at Kirika to make sure she was alright and cursing furiously 
in a combination of English, Japanese, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish 
and what had to be Corsican. Kirika suspected her partner was trying 
hard to keep the poor, confused cabbie from understanding, or she might 
have added French to the mix. Not that it really helped &#150; by the time 
the man had pulled up in front of their apartment ten minutes later, 
Kirika was certain he was more than happy to get rid of them.

Upstairs in the safety of their flat, Mirelle had insisted on examining 
the Japanese assassin&#39;s body carefully, assuring herself that the 
younger woman was safe and untouched before ordering her into a hot 
shower. Mirelle would be making dinner for the two of them. Kirika 
wasn&#39;t to touch anything. The blonde Corsican had been so intense about 
it, Kirika hadn&#39;t dared refuse; though in truth, she had enough things 
on her mind that she could use the time to think. Alex, the thugs and 
the attack &#150;

- Mirelle &#150; her feelings for Mirelle, and Mirelle&#39;s possible feelings 
for her &#150;

Dinner had been a light affair, some warm soup and grilled cheese 
sandwiches. They&#39;d eaten quietly, absorbed in their own thoughts, though 
Kirika noticed Mirelle stealing glances at her every so often. Those 
beautiful sapphire eyes had been so dark, roiling like thunderclouds, 
with too many murky emotions to name. Still, she&#39;d hugged Kirika tightly 
before climbing into bed, and there was no mistaking the warm gentleness 
in that gesture. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.&quot; She&#39;d whispered, voice so soft 
it was almost inaudible.

Kirika had lain still in the dark for several minutes afterwards, caught 
between the comforting safety of her partner&#39;s warmth and the racing of 
her mind. She had felt Mirelle watching her, an intent gaze on the back 
of her head that made the Japanese young woman long to turn and see the 
expression on that beautiful face. Actually, she wanted to shift back 
until she was pressed against the lean, muscled frame behind her, 
cuddled in those strong, caring arms. Then again, she&#39;d had that urge 
for quite a while. Maybe not as strong as it was now that she understood 
her feelings . . . but either way, it was just a faint dream. It would 
never happen, right?

Something hovered over her bare shoulder, a warmth only a hair above the 
skin that still sent her senses into overdrive. It stayed there for a 
long, frozen moment, utterly still &#150; then, ever so hesitant, the soft 
fingers touched lightly to flesh. Mirelle stroked her partner&#39;s shoulder 
once, twice, letting her hand rest there for another long moment before 
slowly withdrawing it. A quiet murmur floated from her side of the bed, 
for once without a trace of sauciness. &quot;Goodnight, Kirika.&quot;

Back in the present, Kirika smiled. She&#39;d fallen asleep fairly quickly 
after that, lulled by the happiness welling up inside her as much as the 
blonde&#39;s familiar, even breathing. It had been incredibly, innocently 
sweet &#150;

&#150; although her dreams afterward had been decidedly not &#150;

Alexander waved a hand in front of her face, laughing. &quot;Earth to Kirika. 
Come in, Kirika!&quot; He grinned at her, eyes dancing. &quot;Sheee-it, was it 
that good? You didn&#39;t &#150; &quot; a pause, and the young woman could have sworn 
her friend was embarrassed. &quot;Did you?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s eyes widened, and she shook her head vigorously, cheeks 
flaming. No, they hadn&#39;t &#150; at least, not in reality. Her dreams, though, 
had been an entirely different story. Apparently, her subconscious had 
decided that realizing her feelings meant it was safe to indulge in a 
fantasy or two. Of the kind she&#39;d never even imagined she could think 
of.

Smoldering lips pressed against hers in a burning kiss, one arm wrapped 
around her waist while elegant fingers tangled in her thick hair. The 
Corsican&#39;s lean frame pushed close, molding their bodies together, 
drawing a breathy whimper from Kirika&#39;s throat and turning her knees to 
jelly. The younger woman&#39;s eyes slid shut as electric pleasure hummed 
beneath her skin. &quot;Mireyu &#150; &quot;

&quot;Kirika.&quot; Mirelle&#39;s voice was rich and dark, heavy with a hunger that 
had nothing to do with food. Her velvet mouth trailed slowly over 
Kirika&#39;s golden-tan chin, slipping along the jawbone and down that 
slender, delicate neck with small, nibbling kisses. Kirika gasped, head 
falling back as her fingers dug into her partner&#39;s hips. Some distant 
part of her mind wondered if Mirelle knew that she&#39;d taken to saying 
Kirika&#39;s name with a faint Japanese accent. The rest of her was absorbed 
in the intoxicating rush of the Corsican&#39;s fingertips trailing smoothly 
over her skin. She was trembling, melting &#150;

The images flashed back only briefly, but they were enough to turn her 
blush from deep pink to a whole new shade of dark red. Kirika shook 
herself mentally. It was her dreams that had clinched it for her, 
sending her from their warm bed while Mirelle slept in so she could seek 
Alexander&#39;s help. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t tell her. I &#150; I wanted to ask for your 
help.&quot;

Alex&#39;s eyebrows rose, and he looked a bit surprised. &quot;My help? With wha 
&#150; &quot; His voice trailed off, puzzled for a moment before his whole face 
lit with delight. &quot;You want to woo her, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Kirika nodded, a bit shakily, but resolute. &quot;That&#39;s what it is, I 
think.&quot; She hitched her bag a little higher on her shoulder, gathering 
her courage in both hands. &quot;I want to know &#150; if she likes me that way. 
And I want her to like me.&quot; Her expression was hesitant. &quot;Is that bad?&quot;

&quot;No way! It&#39;s perfect.&quot; Alexander hugged her again, and Kirika was so 
relieved she didn&#39;t even mind. He was grinning from ear to ear now, 
confident and pleased. &quot;I&#39;m betting she likes you anyway. She&#39;s probably 
given you tons of clues.&quot;

The Japanese young woman thought back for a few seconds, intent. Mirelle 
had given her clues to her feelings? Somehow, it wasn&#39;t easy to bring 
any incident to mind. No doubt Alex would know if something was a clue 
or not, but she didn&#39;t have enough experience to really tell. She knew 
Mirelle cared about her, had been worried about her last night . . . but 
she had a feeling he meant something a little more. So what &#150;

&quot;She gave me chocolates.&quot; Kirika blurted with the startled, gleeful air 
of a young child discovering a hidden Easter egg. &quot;Last night, I guess 
she got them while she was out shopping. She got my favorite kind.&quot;

&quot;Perfect.&quot; Alexander said again, nodding. &quot;They&#39;re small gifts, but 
that&#39;s the point. If you didn&#39;t want them, or if you didn&#39;t like her 
feelings, it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal. She could convince herself it was 
casual.&quot;

&quot;Like the gifts from when she left?&quot; Hope rose in Kirika&#39;s chest, light 
as a helium balloon. Alex looked proud of her. &quot;Yes. Small things that 
she knows you&#39;ll like, but it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t, because she 
can call it just a gift between partners. Then it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;And &#150; and she hugged me last night.&quot; Now a jolt of heat spread through 
her body. Her eyes glowed. &quot;She was scared.&quot;

&quot;I believe it.&quot; Alexander laughed, tugging her down the sidewalk. &quot;Come 
on, we&#39;ll go grab some breakfast at this cute little caf&eacute; I know. We&#39;ve 
got to stay out past lunchtime, anyway.&quot;

Kirika blinked, puzzled, though she followed obediently. &quot;What? Why? 
Mirelle will worry if I&#39;m not home soon.&quot; That was an understatement. 
After last night, the blonde Corsican would be going out of her mind 
when she woke up and found her partner gone. Kirika&#39;s note hadn&#39;t been 
exactly helpful, either.

&quot;That&#39;s the point.&quot; Alex&#39;s grin would have looked perfect on the 
Cheshire Cat. &quot;You want her worried. It works perfectly with the plan.&quot;

&quot;What plan?&quot; Kirika wondered what he was going on about. Alexander&#39;s 
eyes danced.

&quot;The oldest trick in the book, Kirika. Jealousy.&quot;

&quot;So wait a minute. I want to make Mirelle jealous?&quot;

Sitting at Alex&#39;s chosen caf&eacute; about an hour later, Kirika sipped idly at 
the diet soda she&#39;d ordered, listening patiently for her friend to 
explain his &#39;amazing&#39; plan. Alexander sat across from her, a wicked 
smirk on his face as he swigged a gulp from his own paper cup.

&quot;Exactly.&quot; He nodded, elbows propped on the table and leaning forward 
gleefully. &quot;See, I bet part of the problem is she&#39;s scared to admit she 
likes you. It&#39;s hard to do anyway, but when you&#39;re working partners, 
it&#39;s gotta be ten times tougher, right?&quot;

Kirika nodded, and Alex grinned, continuing. &quot;But it&#39;s natural to get 
jealous of people when they have something you don&#39;t. Especially in a 
relationship, when it&#39;s a person you love that maybe belongs to someone 
else, or has feelings for someone else. Have you ever had any friends 
Mirelle was jealous of?&quot;

Rubbing at her nose shyly, Kirika thought for a moment. Milosh 
immediately came to mind; Mirelle had been more sarcastic than usual 
with her orders to break off contact with the tortured artist, 
especially the second time around. Almost cruel, and she knew Mirelle 
was never cruel without a reason. But she&#39;d seemed regretful and almost 
guilty when he died. That image melted into another, of Mirelle&#39;s face 
lit with bloody light from the setting sun, the expression in her 
eyessharp but somehow soft at the same time. Her throat tightened 
slightly. Chloe had been horribly jealous of Mirelle, she knew that 
much. But had Mirelle actually been jealous of the childlike redhead as 
well? Something in her gut said yes.

&quot;Two people.&quot; She agreed finally. &quot;Two friends, close ones. Mirelle &#150; I 
think she was jealous of them both.&quot;

Alexander&#39;s eyes danced. &quot;See, I thought so. She obviously likes you, 
but she&#39;s afraid to admit her feelings. With you as her partner and her 
family, I can sort of see why.&quot;

Slowly, Kirika nodded, taking another drink of her soda before playing 
idly with the straw. This made sense.

&quot;But we also know she&#39;s really jealous of anybody that has your 
attention.&quot; Alex kept up his explanation, sipping at his own cup. &quot;So 
the question is, how do you get her to admit to her feelings if she&#39;s so 
guarded about it? Easy!&quot;

He waved a hand like a magician revealing his latest incredible feat. 
&quot;You make her jealous enough to lose control. If she sees you with 
someone new, she&#39;s bound to get jealous again, even more now because of 
last night. If she sees you romantically with someone new, it&#39;ll be 
twice as bad. So I&#39;ll drop you off back at your apartment,&quot; his eyes 
danced, &quot;and we&#39;ll do a little fake kiss. Nothing steamy or gross,&quot; he 
added hastily, &quot;but enough to make sure she sees. She&#39;ll throw a fit. 
Then all you have to do is casually press her about why she&#39;s acting so 
weird.&quot; His fingers snapped. &quot;Presto! She blurts out something about her 
feelings for you, you assure her that you feel the same way, and it all 
works itself out. It can&#39;t fail.&quot;

Silent for a moment, Kirika found the corners of her lips curling up, 
eyes beginning to gleam. This sounded like it would actually work, 
especially with Mirelle&#39;s sharp, headstrong temper. &quot;Isn&#39;t it bad luck 
to say that before an operation?&quot; She asked softly. Alexander stared for 
a few seconds, then burst into laughter. &quot;Ahhh, you&#39;re right! I don&#39;t 
want to jinx this.&quot;

Reaching out, he caught her hand across the table, squeezing it gently. 
&quot;But it will work, Kirika. We&#39;re gonna make it work.&quot;

Kirika nodded, her own fingers returning the squeeze. &quot;So &#150; what should 
we do until then?&quot;

Alex grinned mischievously. &quot;Well, there&#39;s this great new art store that 
just opened up down the block &#150; &quot;
Sultry, silken lips pressed against hers, moving in a searing haze of 
bliss and pleasure. Mirelle groaned low and deep in her throat, the 
dark-honey sound captured like nectar by Kirika&#39;s sweet mouth. The 
younger woman gave an answering growl, deepening the kiss with a thrust 
of her tongue, and the heat of it made Mirelle&#39;s insides shiver. It felt 
so good &#150;

They broke when their lungs finally forced them apart, both gasping for 
breath. Propped up on the flat of one forearm, the blonde Corsican gazed 
down at her partner with heavy-lidded eyes, brushing Kirika&#39;s bangs back 
with soft, caressing fingertips. A smile touched her kiss-swollen lips, 
hot and shadowed in promise. &quot;Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Mirelle.&quot; Kirika&#39;s voice was a soft moan, her slender body shuddering 
beneath Mirelle&#39;s as those fingertips trailed down her golden cheek. Her 
thick hair fanned out across the pillows, a dark glory against the pale 
cotton, but Mirelle was more interested in the delicate flush rising 
along her lithe, toned frame, the gentle heaving swell of her breasts 
beneath that thin tank-top she always wore to bed. Leaning forward once 
more, the Corsican claimed her partner&#39;s mouth with a deep kiss before 
letting her lips slide oh-so-lightly down Kirika&#39;s elegant neck. Her 
teeth scraped at the tanned skin, testing and teasing, a jolt of liquid 
fire shooting through her nerves as she heard a breathy whine starting 
in the back of Kirika&#39;s throat. She loved that sound, so full of heat 
and whispered want. She especially loved hearing Kirika make that kind 
of sound, causing her to make that kind of sound.

Lean, muscled legs &#150; bare save a light sheen of sweat &#150; slid against the 
blonde&#39;s, the hot contact of skin on skin making Mirelle suck in an 
aching gasp, mouth still pressed just below her partner&#39;s collarbone. 
The Corsican shifted slightly, moving her thigh until it pressed hard 
against the juncture between Kirika&#39;s own. Fierce satisfaction slammed 
through Mirelle as she realized the younger woman&#39;s light cotton shorts 
were already faintly damp. Kirika moaned, hips jerking up instinctively 
in response to the pressure. &quot;Mireyu &#150; Mireyu, oh &#150; &quot;

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; Her tone was rough, a possessive wildness coloring the words 
with crimson heat. Mirelle slid the thin straps of Kirika&#39;s tank-top 
down her slender shoulders, baring Kirika&#39;s upper chest to the blonde&#39;s 
hungry gaze. The younger woman whimpered, shuddering deliciously at the 
doubled contact, and Mirelle could feel her partner&#39;s pulse racing 
beneath her lips. Smirking just slightly, Mirelle let her mouth travel 
lower, tongue making soft, swirling caresses along one perfect breast. 
She was rewarded with a shaky sound of pure, molten desire, nipple 
rising taut and hard to her touch, Kirika&#39;s nails digging into the 
mattress as the Japanese arched herself against the pale porcelain body 
above her. Her own breathing shallow, the blonde slipped her fingers 
beneath the hem of the shirt, trailing them lightly along Kirika&#39;s 
smooth, flat stomach. Bumping over the elastic waistband, her fingertips 
darted farther down, rubbed and pressed almost tauntingly. She loved 
this, too. The building tension, all the heated teasing &#150; knowing with 
every small noise and trembling jerk that she could give her adored 
partner such obvious pleasure, that Kirika wanted her so very much. 
Drawing the warm peak into her mouth, Mirelle suckled at it slowly, 
savoring the sharp passionate gasp from above her as much as the hot, 
lightly sweat-salted taste. This was how it should be &#150;

Hands tugged hard at her simple nightshirt, one impatiently unfastening 
buttons while the other dragged her back up for another blazing kiss. 
The world spun briefly, a rioting kaleidoscope of motion and feel, and 
the blonde found herself suddenly on her back, looking up into Kirika&#39;s 
eyes made dark and burning with desire. The younger woman ground her 
hips into Mirelle&#39;s, husky voice panting and almost laughing at the same 
time. &quot;You &#150; are &#150; a tease, Mireyu.&quot;

Now it was Mirelle&#39;s turn to moan, Kirika&#39;s fingers abandoning the 
fastenings for a moment to dance across her partner&#39;s ribs. The blonde&#39;s 
nerves sizzled as those same fingers stroked higher, thumbs rolling her 
nipples until she cried out, breathless and pleading. &quot;Ki-Kirika &#150;&quot; Her 
throat caught so tightly she could hardly do more than gasp. &quot;Kirika &#150; 
oh Kirika please.&quot;

Kirika made a low, dark version of her usual agreeing noise, returning 
to the last of the buttons. Her own tanktop had vanished, though Mirelle 
wasn&#39;t quite sure where; she only knew the lean frame pressed against 
her was bare from the waist up, a toned expanse of heated skin and 
strong muscle. Mirelle choked on another heady moan as her partner&#39;s 
teeth sunk suddenly into her neck, hard enough to leave a jolt of aching 
pleasure behind. The blonde knew instinctively what it was. A mark, a 
claim, a visible sign of all the fierce passion burning between them. To 
be claimed by Kirika &#150; the intoxicating thought sent the Corsican&#39;s 
already-dizzy mind reeling. The heat between her thighs was a throbbing 
blaze now, her flesh buzzing in waves, begging for more of that familiar 
touch until she thought she might go mad. Her hand tangled blindly in 
Kirika&#39;s thick hair, urging the smaller woman on without words. Kirika&#39;s 
mouth slipped obligingly lower, almost smiling, velvet smoothness even 
better against sensitized skin. Nuzzling softly, her fingers tracing 
light circles across the blonde&#39;s inner thigh, while the other hand 
began the slow, sensuous pulling of her pale white panties &#150; Mirelle 
moaned, her entire body tightening in reaction, arching, aching, 
pleading &#150;

&#150; and a car horn blared outside, loud enough to wake the dead.

Or at least, a dreaming assassin. Mirelle jerked bolt-upright, heart 
racing, completely disoriented for a moment as her sleeping reality was 
rent in half. Then the world slammed back into focus, and she gave a 
shocked gasp, leaping from the bed and running for the bathroom like it 
was on fire. Twisting the shower knob almost frantically, she nearly 
threw herself into the icy spray, letting it fall in needles across her 
naked body.

What in the hell had that been? Staring into the thundering droplets 
with unseeing eyes, Mirelle brushed away her already-plastered bangs 
with a shaking hand. To her growing horror, she realized it wasn&#39;t just 
her hands; her legs, her whole body was trembling and flushed, muscles 
deep in the pit of her stomach clenched in a tight ache. It wasn&#39;t 
normal, and for a few seconds she found herself lost.

You&#39;re aroused. That sarcastic voice she was truly beginning to hate 
skittered through her thoughts, smirkingly amused. It&#39;s called a wet 
dream, genius. You dreamed about Kirika, and it made you hot. But you 
knew that already &#150; you just don&#39;t like it.

Mirelle took a sharp breath, stunned and wanting to argue &#150; then, teeth 
clenched, she let it out slowly, forcing calm with the instincts born of 
a lifetime of deadly training. Actually, if she wanted to be honest with 
herself, the voice was right. She wasn&#39;t anywhere near stupid in that 
particular area of life, in spite of her unorthodox upbringing and 
possibly-terminal virginity; Uncle Claude had treated sex and its 
related subjects with the same careful attention to detail that he 
showed every other part of her life. Biologically speaking, it had been 
a simple, natural reaction, and it shouldn&#39;t have bothered her a bit.

Intellectually, though, it was a whole different matter. Never mind that 
Kirika was female, and Mirelle had never had even the slightest feelings 
for anyone of the same gender before. Aside from a few small, tame 
flings with young men when she&#39;d been a few years younger, she hadn&#39;t 
really had an attraction to anyone. It was too dangerous, for her and 
for whoever caught her eye. No, what had really shaken her was the sense 
of . . . connection, in the dream. The sense of complete attraction that 
had been more than simple desire or even lust, an utter belonging that 
went deeper than any words could ever describe. She hadn&#39;t just wanted 
Kirika. She had known Kirika, known the way they would both respond, 
understood it and welcomed it to the very marrow of her bones. And it 
hadn&#39;t faded much, either. Even now, standing awake under the 
newly-steaming shower, she could remember every gentle stroke, every 
fierce brush of lips, everything that made her blood pulse and heart 
soar &#150;

Her throat tightened, a mix of terror and remembered anticipation 
mingling in her chest. It frightened her beyond imagining that she could 
desire something so wild, that she could want to lose control so badly. 
She had spent her whole life &#150; her whole assassin&#39;s life, anyway &#150; 
striving to keep perfect discipline. Herself, her hits, it didn&#39;t 
matter. Control was the heart of someone in her position. You never gave 
it up to anyone, no matter what. Hell, she and Kirika had spent the 
better part of a year fighting to regain control of their lives from 
Soldats. How could she ever want to throw all that away, even dreaming?

Mirelle slammed her hand into the shower wall with a sudden surge of 
fury. She wasn&#39;t quite sure who she was mad at &#150; herself, the dream, 
Kirika, some combination of all three &#150; but she knew she was angrier 
than she should be. Temper, temper. Her inner voice smirked. It&#39;s not 
the poor tiles&#39; fault you dreamed about coping off your pretty little 
partner. But maybe it&#39;s easier to get angry at something than think 
about your feelings. If you&#39;re punching holes in the bathroom, you don&#39;t 
have to admit why you&#39;re really afraid.

The Corsican snarled soundlessly, throwing her soaked hair behind one 
shoulder. I&#39;m not afraid of anything. She informed her subconscious 
tartly. Why would I be afraid of some stupid dream that didn&#39;t mean 
anything anyway? It&#39;s just like dreaming about talking snails or dogs 
that do laundry. A random firing of brain neurons that puts together odd 
pictures based on things seen or thought of during the day.

Of course. The voice agreed, mock-serious. Just a random wet dream. And 
the fact that you always go into clinical speak when you&#39;re flustered 
means nothing, either.

Mirelle ground her teeth in frustration. It was a biological reaction, 
nothing more. I haven&#39;t had a fling with anyone in over a year &#150; it was 
obviously just a reaction to the stress of the last few days. Like the 
altitude and time-changes. I just need to get my head clear, and I&#39;ll be 
fine.

The idea was believable enough to put aside her worries, and Mirelle 
leaned back slightly into the warm spray, hoping the heat would help 
relax her tense muscles as she washed up. After the attack last night, 
it was natural that she&#39;d dream about Kirika, she told herself firmly. 
The other girl was an important part of her life, if not the most 
important; Kirika in danger had sent her protective instincts into 
overdrive, and it made sense that it would have continued in her sleep. 
She was just glad that her little partner hadn&#39;t noticed her jumping out 
of bed like a ninny. That would have been more than a little 
embarrassing, to say the least.

Speaking of which, where was Kirika? With a frown, Mirelle twisted the 
shower knob off and pushed back the curtain, eyes darkening ominously. 
She&#39;d known the moment she woke up that the young woman wasn&#39;t curled up 
beside her, but in the back of her mind, she&#39;d assumed her partner was 
simply in the kitchen making tea or sketching in the main area of their 
flat. Now, though, she knew from the silence in the apartment that she 
was the only one home. Grabbing for a towel, she wrapped it swiftly 
around herself, tucking the free end roughly under the top as she strode 
from the bathroom. Logically, the blonde knew Kirika had probably just 
left to get some groceries from the store or on a quick errand; there 
was no way anyone could possibly have snuck in and taken just Kirika 
without the two of them waking up, after all. But logic had nothing to 
do with the threads of worry twisting through the pit of her stomach.

A quick scan of her sapphire gaze revealed a small, folded sheet of 
paper, pulled neatly from one of Kirika&#39;s sketchbooks and propped 
against her laptop screen. Mirelle plucked it from the table with two 
fingers, concern fading as she read the words written in Kirika&#39;s 
unmistakable hand.

&quot;Went out for things &#150; be back soon?&quot; What the hell is that supposed to 
mean? The Corsican went over the note a second time, then a third, 
irritation growing with each moment. After last night, what in the hell 
was Kirika thinking! She shouldn&#39;t have been going anywhere by herself. 
And leaving something this vague &#150; be back soon could mean just about 
anything, for cripes&#39; sake. Did the younger woman expect her to sit 
around waiting for hours?

Nevermind that you usually expect her to do the same thing when you go 
out by yourself.

Mirelle shoved that thought away, crumpling the note in her hand and 
half-hurling it into the trashcan beside the pool table. Almost 
stomping, she strode to the bedroom, yanking clothes out with hardly 
even a glance to see if they matched. So what if Kirika was gone? It 
wasn&#39;t like she needed the Japanese assassin to hold her hand for 
everything. She&#39;d done things by herself for years!

The cell phone perched on the bedside table began vibrating, lighting up 
as it rang cheerfully, and in spite of herself the blonde leapt to 
snatch it up. Maybe Kirika was calling. And I can give her a piece of my 
mind, Mirelle added the thought hastily, ignoring a snicker from her 
smirking subconscious. A quick glance at the glowing front screen, 
though, showed a number she didn&#39;t recognize. Lips pursed in a frown, 
the Corsican paused, mind running with possibilities. Andre wouldn&#39;t 
have risked calling from a land-line or someone else&#39;s phone, especially 
with Garrison out to get us. Besides, he doesn&#39;t even know about the 
attack yesterday, he wouldn&#39;t have a reason to call. Paula and the rest 
have their names programmed in, so it&#39;s not one of them. Besides, all of 
them would use the apartment phone, not my cell. And there&#39;s no way 
Kirika would be calling &#150;

&#150; unless she got attacked again and lost her phone. Then she&#39;d have to 
use a payphone, and she&#39;d want to make sure to reach me. After another 
moment of hesitation, Mirelle sighed and flipped it open, holding the 
phone to her ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Miss Bouquet. It&#39;s good to hear from you.&quot; The aristocratic voice was 
male, and once again, instantly familiar. Mirelle dropped the shirt 
she&#39;d pulled out and gaped slightly, sapphire eyes widening. &quot;Mr. 
Breffort?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; A slight rustle, and the blonde could hear leather creaking in 
the background, as though the Councilman was leaning forward in a 
high-end office chair. &quot;I apologize for calling at such an early hour. I 
didn&#39;t wake the two of you, did I?&quot;

Her face hardened, voice clipped. &quot;No. Kirika is out, and I&#39;m already 
up.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Breffort sounded just a hair surprised for a moment. &quot;In 
that case, if you aren&#39;t too busy, would you consider a meeting with me? 
I have a bit of information I would like to pass on, and it&#39;s &#150; rather 
sensitive to talk about over the phone.&quot;

Mirelle&#39;s first reaction was a sulky, childish no. Whatever information 
he had, it couldn&#39;t be as important as he was making it sound. Besides, 
he was a Soldats high Councilman, the deadliest liars there were. Why 
should she care what he asked? Screw it all.

Still, her gut instincts said she could believe him &#150; and her assassin&#39;s 
training taught her not to give up any possible intel or lead, no matter 
how slight. She didn&#39;t like the idea of going by herself, but she&#39;d be 
damned if she was going to call Kirika&#39;s phone. Let Kirika wonder where 
she&#39;d gone, if her partner ever got home. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll meet you in 
half an hour, at the park.&quot;

For no more than a second, she could have sworn she could feel Breffort 
smiling on the other end of the phone. &quot;Of course, my dear. I look 
forward to it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll just bet you do.&quot; Mirelle muttered darkly, flipping the phone 
closed without saying goodbye. One hand flung the cell onto the pillows, 
the other grabbing for her clothes. In minutes, she was dressed and 
shrugging into her coat.

At least this promised to be something interesting to do.
Gee, once again, Mirelle being petty. The dream ended up longer than I 
meant it to be, so the real confrontation is next chapter - technically, 
the next two shall happily straighten out exactly who&#39;s who and what&#39;s 
going on. (sadistic laugh) Three other one-shots are also in the works - 
one featuring the Belladonna Lily Woman from episode five or so (and 
related to the doujinshi), one following Breffort and his feelings for 
the maidens of death, and another from farther down the road in the 
what-if universe that deals with a bit of emotional / dramatic 
semi-fluff. Also, the next chapters should be easier, since I finally 
got Mirelle&#39;s idiotic denials out of the way. xD</pre>
