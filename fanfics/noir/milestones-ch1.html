<h1>Milestones (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bulmafox.html">Bulmafox</a><br> </h2>
<pre>You&#39;re late today. You&#39;re usually dressed by now. I look up from my 
sketch in time to see you remove your shirt. You&#39;re standing in front of 
the dresser, with your back towards me. But I don&#39;t care. I love your 
back. I love your legs, I love your hair; there&#39;s no part of you I don&#39;t 
love.

There it is again, that...feeling...&#39;attraction&#39; I think it&#39;s called. I 
should be used to it by now. But I&#39;m not. It always feels new and 
overwhelming. It feels like someone&#39;s going to attack, but they never do. I 
don&#39;t know. But for some reason I think I like it.

But you don&#39;t know. You don&#39;t know what I feel for you. You know I 
wouldn&#39;t be alive if not for you. Still, you never say anything about it. 
We&#39;re always making small talk.

Or do you? Do you know? Did you read my letter? I&#39;m afraid to look, see 
if it&#39;s still there. 

I want to tell you, Mireille. I want to tell you so badly I feel I&#39;m 
gonna burst if I don&#39;t. I want to tell you I&#39;m attracted to you and I 
want to kiss you and I want to do things to you. But how? I&#39;ve never done 
this before. WHat do I say?

&#39;Mireille, you know those women on TV--&#39; No.

&#39;Um Mireille? I have something to tell you.&#39; I...don&#39;t know. 

Ah! &#39;Mireille, I find you attractive and I want to kiss you.&#39; Yes. 
That&#39;s good. Be blunt. Get it over with.

&quot;Mirei--&quot; 

But you&#39;re already leaning over the bed, fully dressed, holding a 
letter. Is that my letter?

&quot;Kirika, I need to tell you something.&quot;</pre>
