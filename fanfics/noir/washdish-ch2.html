<h1>Washing the Dishes (part 2 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakablonde.html">Bakablonde</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/washdish-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It&#39;s so good to sleep in your own bed. When I wake up in the morning, 
she is already up. She&#39;s always gotten up first. I&#39;m not exactly an 
early morning person, more so since I was shot. I still take a pill at 
night to help the pain, but I feel so good this morning I don&#39;t think I 
want to take any more.

Breakfast sits on the table; she&#39;s at the computer, so I go to eat 
quietly, not wanting to bother her. When I&#39;m done, I put the dishes in 
the sink and start to turn on the water.

&quot;Leave those for later.&quot; she says from behind me. &quot;We have a meeting 
today with Anton.&quot;

&quot;Anton?&quot; I remember him, vaguely. Dark hair and always smiling.

&quot;My police informant. I&#39;ve been talking about a job with him.&quot;

&quot;Job?&quot; I shudder. I don&#39;t want to kill any more. I don&#39;t want to touch 
another gun.

&quot;Not that sort of job. A ...dull one. That pays squat, but is legal.&quot; 
she practically pouts at the last part, bringing a smile to my face.

Suddenly there&#39;s a knock at the door, causing us both to frown. Mireille 
reaches under the pool table out of habit as I go to the door.

&quot;Who is it?&quot; I ask, feeling nervous.

&quot;Mireille, darling, do open up! It&#39;s Anton, your favorite officer!&quot; 
booms a cheery voice. Mireille rolls her eyes and nods for me to open 
the door. I do, and am immediately engulfed in a large embrace.

&quot;There you- oh! So sorry, little one!&quot; he steps back, grinning. &quot;Didn&#39;t 
mean to squash you. &quot;

&quot;I thought we were going to meet at the caf&eacute;.&quot; Mireille remarks, her 
frown not entirely gone.

&quot;Ah yes, but it would have been awkward to give you this.&quot; He steps 
forward, taking a grand flourish and a bow, then produces a large red 
bouquet of roses from behind his back.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Mireille says, her mouth dropping open in surprise. He quickly 
strides over to her and bends down, his mouth aiming for hers. Just as 
quickly, a snapping sound echoes over the room as she slaps him.

I can&#39;t help but laugh, mostly from relief, as he staggers back.

&quot;Always worth a try.&quot; he smiles, rubbing his cheek. Mireille gets up 
from the table as if nothing has happened, and heads toward the kitchen.

&quot;I&#39;m going to get a vase.&quot; she says to no one in particular.

I stand next to Anton, and we both watch her leave the room. Anton 
sighs.

&quot;Love&#39;s a rough thing, little bit.&quot; he ruffles my hair with his hand.

&quot;You- you&#39;re in love with Mireille?&quot; I gasp out, and he puts a finger on 
my lips, shushing me. He bends down and whispers in my ear.

&quot;Ah, I&#39;m in love with that ass, little bit, and I&#39;ll do most anything to 
get it.&quot; he winks and I try not to show the flood of emotions coming 
over me.

&quot;Her...ass?&quot; I whisper back. It seems funny, to be talking about 
Mireille&#39;s ass, but in another way, I like it.

&quot;The best I&#39;ve ever seen. Take a look yourself sometime. Ah, you&#39;re so 
lucky, little one, to be her flatmate- you get to see that ass every 
day!&quot; he squeezes the top of my head for emphasis and I yelp.

&quot;What are you doing to her?&quot; Mireille appears back in the room, looking 
like she&#39;s ready to throw the vase at Anton.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; I say, rubbing my head.

&quot;We were discussing your lovely ass.&quot; Anton arches his eyebrows 
suggestively in her direction.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; she gasps, staring at me.

&quot;Not me, Mireille! &quot; I stammer out, suddenly embarrassed. &quot;He started 
it!&quot;

She puts her hands on her hips, pursing her lips. Anton opens his mouth 
to speak but she points at him, silencing him.

&quot;Don&#39;t you even say that I&#39;m beautiful when I&#39;m angry, Anton. I know 
your lines.&quot;

&quot;Why Mireille, I was just going to suggest we leave for lunch.&quot; he 
replies smoothly.

&quot;Meet us downstairs then. Oh, and thanks for the flowers.&quot; she waves at 
him dismissively, and he turns to me, shrugs, and heads out the door.

She retrieves her purse, and checks it for her gun.

&quot;Do you like him, Mireille?&quot; I venture out the question.

&quot;What? That womanizer?&quot; she snaps her purse shut. &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, 
Kirika.&quot; She stops suddenly, and a strange look crosses her face.

&quot;Do you like him?&quot; she stares at me. I can&#39;t even believe she just asked 
me that question. The look on my face must answer her, as she gives a 
little laugh and shakes her head.

&quot;Good. Come on, let&#39;s see what Mr. Womanizer has lined up for us.&quot;

----------

&quot;At least it&#39;s legal.&quot; I try to console her as we sit at the table 
having our last tea of the night.

She snorts. &quot;From top&#150;notch assassin.... to doing this...stupid self 
defense class...&quot; she growls out.

&quot;We&#39;re helping people.&quot;

&quot;It pays more to kill them.&quot; she retorts, and I can&#39;t help but smile. So 
Mireille. She plays with the sleeves of her nightshirt, frowning, before 
she gets up and takes our empty cups.

I watch her from the doorway, and am filled again with the urge to hold 
her. I walk up behind her and encircle her waist.

&quot;Again?&quot; she says in surprise, but makes no move to stop me.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;This makes you happy, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;How silly.&quot; she mutters, and sets about her work. With a happy sigh I 
let my face rest against her back, and my body relax into hers, enjoying 
her motion. The soft rocking of her working body is like a living 
lullaby, and I feel like I could not find a better place to sleep in the 
whole world other than where I am at this moment.

&quot;Are you falling asleep back there?&quot;

&quot;Uh?&quot; I am startled back to earth.

&quot;You&#39;re drooling on me.&quot; she says, but I can tell from the sound of her 
voice she&#39;s smiling.

&quot;Sorry...&quot; I murmur, not wanting to move.

&quot;Silly. Go to bed, Kirika.&quot; she says in that soft tone that makes my 
heart flutter.</pre>
