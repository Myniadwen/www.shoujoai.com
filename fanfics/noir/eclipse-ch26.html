<h1>Eclipse (part 26 of 32)</h1>

<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;This time I think I should go first. I imagine I&#39;m far less exciting 
than Noir.&quot; Uncle tries to smile away my disappointment.

&quot;I understand.&quot; I sigh and nod my head. I have so many questions, but 
this visit isn&#39;t just for me. I sit down on the vinyl chair and clunk my 
head back into the wall. I feel so hot and drained. Nothing I went 
through with Soldats, or at the Manor, made me feel as tired as I am 
now. Somehow, it&#39;s as if the very energy of life is being siphoned from 
my body.

&quot;Going to get a drink.&quot; Henry grunts as he gets up, and lumbers over to 
the water fountain.

Mireille sits down next to me and idly flips through a magazine. I stare 
at her, trying to read her somehow. There&#39;s no sign of her earlier 
outburst; she might as well be waiting to get her hair done, reading 
quietly, seeming oblivious to the world around her.

&quot;Why are you staring at me?&quot; she asks calmly.

&quot;Just- you&#39;ve been so...strange. Since the telegram.&quot; I keep my voice 
low.

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s you who&#39;s been strange- since the picture.&quot; she turns the 
page. &quot;Did you ever stop to think about that?&quot;

I feel my mouth open, but am unable to reply. I silently watch as Henry 
returns and sits down. I look past him and see Uncle coming back down 
the hallway. Eager with anticipation, I jump to my feet. I have so many 
questions, I&#39;m not sure where to start.

&quot;Our turn already?&quot; Mireille gets up and stretches. &quot;He must be tired.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I whisper, looking at Uncle&#39;s face. &quot;He&#39;s dead.&quot;



&quot;More water?&quot; Mireille asks me. The room is still spinning, and I still 
feel sick to my stomach.

&quot;No...no thanks.&quot; I hold onto my stomach. Uncle is sitting next to me, 
and I feel him put his hand on my knee, giving me a reassuring squeeze.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kirika.&quot; he sighs. &quot;He died this morning.&quot;

&quot;Well, they did say he might not make it.&quot; Mireille takes the cup and 
hands it to Henry. &quot;And our visit yesterday may have done him more harm 
than good.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it was the visit from yesterday. I believe it was the 
visit from this morning.&quot; Uncle removes his hand and leans heavily on 
his cane as he stands.

&quot;He had another visitor this morning, right before us. His niece.&quot; He 
turns and looks at us both. &quot;A niece- who wears her hair pulled back and 
has a small dog.&quot;

Tierney. My stomach twists even more at the thought of her and her 
needles.

&quot;I&#39;m sure it was over quickly.&quot; Uncle shakes his head. &quot;Come, we have no 
further business here.&quot;

Mireille holds out her hand, pulling me up. She has a strange look on 
her face, almost as if she&#39;s amused.

&quot;So- Droger wins again.&quot; She arches an eyebrow. &quot;Impressive.&quot;

And the matchstick man...I shiver, remembering the thin figure in the 
sun.
