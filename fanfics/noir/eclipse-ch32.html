<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch31.html">Back to Part 31</a><pre>I sit at the table in absolute misery. Uncle is staring at me, but I 
can&#39;t look at him.

&quot;You haven&#39;t touched your breakfast, Kirika.&quot; He gently urges me.

&quot;Is it true?&quot; I ask dully, not interested in food.

&quot;Is what true? Kirika, please, eat some toast or something.&quot; Uncle 
sounds worried.

I push my toast with my knife. &quot;Is it true about Mireille and Droger?&quot;

A silence fills the room. Henry holds his fork in mid-air. I look at 
Uncle. He wads up his napkin as if he&#39;s suddenly angry and throws it on 
the floor.

&quot;Damn him. Damn him to hell.&quot; He shakes his head in disgust. &quot;Playing 
that card like this.&quot;

I lay the knife down. I feel numb.

&quot;Roland Bouquet was a smart businessman, but he made two poor decisions 
in his life.&quot;

Uncle grunts as he reaches down and retrieves his napkin.

&quot;Granting Droger a privilege he did not deserve; and denying Noir to 
Soldats.&quot; He looks at me and I see something in his eyes that makes me 
nervous.

&quot;He paid with his life for his second mistake; I hope his daughter does 
not pay with hers for his first.&quot;



A door slams and we all fall quiet as Mireille enters the room. She says 
nothing to acknowledge Uncle, instead marching to the end of the table 
and seating herself.

&quot;And a good morning to you, Lady Bouquet.&quot; Uncle is displeased, I can 
tell by his tone.

&quot;Good morning, everyone.&quot; Mireille studiously helps herself to some tea.

&quot;Would you care to discuss what you and Kirika were yelling about this 
morning? She&#39;s so upset she can&#39;t even eat.&quot; Uncle looks pointedly at 
Mireille. She glances over at my plate and frowns.

&quot;Would you care to discuss why you lied to us about Droger?&quot; she arches 
her eyebrows as she looks back at Uncle. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s you that&#39;s sickened 
her to her stomach.&quot;

&quot;Mirielle!&quot; I gasp out, shocked.

&quot;Droger manipulated your father. I would advise you not to let him do 
the same to you.&quot; Uncle&#39;s voice is tense. I can tell Mireille is getting 
to him.

&quot;Mirelle, please- please stop. I&#39;ll eat.&quot; I pick up the toast and bite 
into it. It&#39;s tasteless and I feel like gagging.

&quot;The past needs to stay in the past. We must focus on the problem here 
and now. All of us.&quot; Uncle nods his head at me. He wads up his napkin 
again. I watch him, feeling nervous.

&quot;He&#39;s right, you know.&quot; Henry interjects. &quot;Everyone should just calm 
down and focus.&quot;

&quot;We need to plan our next course of action.&quot; Uncle reaches down and rubs 
his knee.

&quot;Better plan well. Droger&#39;s outsmarted you at every turn so far.&quot; 
Mireille snorts in disdain.

&quot;Mireille! How can you say such a thing?&quot; my mouth falls open.

&quot;It&#39;s true. He&#39;s blocked their every move.&quot; she snaps out. &quot;No wonder 
Soldats hates him!&quot;

&quot;That wouldn&#39;t be because someone has told him what our plans are, is 
it?&quot; Uncle retorts, standing up so quickly that his chair falls over. 
The fury in his face frightens me; Mireille has pushed him too far this 
time, I can tell.

She stands up, her face darkened with anger. I see her reach for her 
purse.

&quot;Mireille, no!&quot; I cry out. She slams her purse down on the table and 
points at Uncle.

&quot;Get out.&quot;

&quot;No, Mireille! No!&quot; I jump over to her and grab her arm.

&quot;Droger is using you! Come to your senses now!&quot; Uncle takes his cane and 
points over the table at Mireille.

&quot;Soldats is using me- using us- just to get back the book! Get out of 
both our lives! Now!&quot; she twists away from me, throwing me back onto the 
floor.

Uncle slams his cane down on the table, sending the dishes crashing to 
the floor.

&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; he thunders. &quot;I will not tolerate this insolence 
another moment!&quot; he whirls and stabs his cane down to the floor, heading 
towards the door. Henry, eyes wide, follows him silently.

&quot;What you can&#39;t tolerate is the truth!&quot; Mireille shouts after him.

Uncle takes a few more steps and stops. He turns slowly and looks at 
Mireille. The look in his eyes frightens me.

&quot;The truth... is that you&#39;ve chosen the same path as your father. 
Goodbye, Mireille Bouquet.&quot;

A sense of dread washes over me as he speaks. This must not happen- I 
cannot let it happen.

&quot;Uncle, please come back!&quot; I call out to him, scrambling to get to my 
feet. He ignores me, continuing his path to the door.

&quot;Kirika- let him go.&quot; Mireille orders.

&quot;No!&quot; I brush past her, running after him. &quot;We cannot let him go!&quot;

Uncle doesn&#39;t look back at me. Henry clicks the door quickly behind 
them.

&quot;Wait, please!&quot; I stumble around the corner of the sofa. I run panting 
to the door, and reach for the handle.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice stops me. I turn and face her. She&#39;s got her 
gun with the silencer on it, pointed at my head.

&quot;Let go of the doorknob. Now.&quot; She growls out.

&quot;But Mireille, you don&#39;t understand! You-&quot; I jump as a bullet breaks the 
molding next to my head.

&quot;I said now.&quot; She takes another step forward, aiming between my eyes. My 
breathing is shallow, unsure. We stare at each other, her eyes 
glistening in that frightful way that I cannot bear to see. I have to 
save her from herself, from this madness.

&quot;You must trust them! Mireille- we have to- &quot; I start to stutter out, 
but she interrupts me.

&quot;How dare you betray me now!&quot; her voice is shaking with anger. Her chest 
is heaving with emotion; I see her face twist as she tries to bring 
herself under control. She takes a few more steps towards me. Her face 
hardens and her eyes...I am afraid. I&#39;ve never been afraid of Mireille 
before. She clears her throat to speak.

&quot;If you choose to go out that door- you will not come back in alive.&quot;
