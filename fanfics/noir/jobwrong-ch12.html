<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 12 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>	Oh yes, sorry I forgot to mention earlier, the idea of making 
Kirika go out with someone to make Mireille jealous actually came from 
Cabeloe. If anyone else has ideas, feel free to e-mail me. Address in my 
profile.

	This chapter was drafted during a very slow paced business studies 
lesson, I hope my teacher doesn&#39;t read these....


The War of the Women.

	
	Mireille looked evilly at the woman before her, subconsciously 
taking in each and every detail. Storing them away in her memory with 
the skill only an assassin can accomplish. She was as Mireille had 
noticed earlier, middle aged with long brown dark hair that fell in 
disarray down her back. Mireille could just notice hints of red in it, 
suggesting it was dyed. 

	She was neither pretty nor ugly, and whilst no one would ever 
class her as beautiful, she was fairly attractive in a mature kind of 
way. She was plain, with unmarked tanned features. Just a normal person 
making her living in this less than savoury world.

	Something which did surprise her was the way in which neither 
Laura nor Kirika made any shows of affection to each other, besides a 
greeting nod. Perhaps she had been wrong about the nature of their 
relationship? Had she just been overly jealous and quick to jump to the 
most painful conclusion? 

	&quot;So you&#39;re Mireille?&quot; The woman asked, dispelling the silence that 
was threatening to smother them all.

	&quot;Yes I am.&quot; Then  just to remind her, if she had perhaps 
forgotten, &quot;I&#39;m a world renowned assassin, hundreds of hits completed, 
you said you were a psychiatrist?&quot; The woman nodded, her eyes searching 
for an escape route.

	&quot;Umm, yeah that&#39;s right...&quot;

	&quot;You must meet loads of interesting people.&quot; Mireille made it more 
of a question than a statement.

	&quot;A few...&quot; the woman laughed nervously. Mireille, almost 
innocently reached into her handbag and pulled out her Walther P99, 
placing it on the table before bringing out her purse and setting it 
down next to it. As quick as a flash she whisked the weapon away. She 
was very pleased to see Laura&#39;s frightened eyes.

	&quot;Anyone want a drink?&quot; Mireille chirped happily, a waiter appeared 
and took their order. Mireille ordered a cocktail, Kirika some tea and 
Laura a bottle of mineral water, the waiter reappeared a few seconds 
later and they each gratefully sipped on their drinks. Mireille made an 
effort to ignore Laura, and it showed by the total silence that radiated 
from their table. With Kirika being a naturally silent person and Laura 
obviously not planning on saying anything. 

	It was at this point that Mireille noticed some silent interplay 
going on between the two of them, significant glances and imperceptible 
nods of the head. Kirika seemed to be arguing something and Laura 
answering in the negative. Mireille&#39;s eyes narrowed.

	&quot;So,&quot; The psychiatrist suddenly exclaimed,  &quot;are you two friends 
or what?&quot; Mireille felt her eyes widen slightly, that question had been 
asked rather probingly. Could it be that the woman was jealous? If so 
what did it mean about the nature of their relationship, surely they 
couldn&#39;t be that close if she was asking such. 

	&quot;We live with each other, we&#39;ve been partners for years and in the 
underworld we&#39;re the best. So yeah, I guess we&#39;re pretty close.&quot; She let 
that comment hang in the air ambiguously, neither answering nor 
dismissing her question. 

	Kirika was looking at her strangely by this point, Mireille hoped 
the girl wasn&#39;t angry with her. More likely she was just wondering why 
Mireille was being so bitchy, oblivious to it&#39;s reason. Or at least, 
Mireille certainly hoped so. 

	&quot;What are your feelings for each other?&quot; The psychiatrist asked 
again, catching Mireille unprepared by the quick question. She answered 
instantly, and perhaps badly.

	&quot;We&#39;re just good friends...&quot; She trailed off dangerously, the 
woman had a mischievous glint in her eyes that Mireille didn&#39;t like one 
little bit. 

	&quot;So you don&#39;t mind me stepping in?&quot; The woman cooed, placing an 
arm around Kirika&#39;s shoulder and dragging the shocked girl close. 
Mireille felt her eyes bulge and her teeth grate painfully together. Her 
muscles flexed slightly as she contemplated the gun in her handbag. 

	&quot;No...why should I?&quot; She grated out, her tone leaving no confusion 
that she thought otherwise. The woman simply smiled.

	&quot;You don&#39;t sound very sure...&quot; She tightened her grip around 
Kirika, bringing her closer, their faces were almost touching, their 
lips mere inches apart. 

	Mireille felt her breathing quicken, she was positive that her 
face was a thundercloud and she didn&#39;t care. She was going to do 
violence, already she could feel her less than tentative grasp on her 
sanity slip. Violence is not the answer, violence is not the answer, 
Dammit I don&#39;t care, it&#39;ll make me feel better!

	Why do you care? Her insistent mind asked innocently enough. 
However she wasn&#39;t in the mood for this constant debate with her mind. 
SHUT UP! I don&#39;t care why I care, I just know that I do, and I&#39;ll be 
damned if I let this slut take my Kirika! 

	Perhaps the woman had seen the hate in her eyes, or felt the 
violence in the air, for she quickly disengaged herself from Kirika and 
excused herself. Apparently making for the restroom. Mireille was sure 
the woman could feel the stare digging into her back, if her quickening 
pace was anything to go by.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Laura was standing in the bathroom, her face dripping wet from the 
water she had splashed on her face. Her reflection in the mirror stared 
back at her.

	&quot;What on Earth did I do that for?&quot; She asked her reflection, as 
always there was no answer, only a condescending glance in reply. 

	&quot;Am I attracted to the little girl?.... No, I&#39;m not.&quot; That much 
was true, she knew her actions had nothing to do with any physical 
attraction. It was unfortunately much simpler.

	A challenge. The tall, blonde, beautiful Corsican woman had 
immediately made her blood boil with envy, and to see that woman reduced 
to a wreck because she thought Laura had something she herself wanted... 
One fault of Laura&#39;s own was her pride, and the woman had insulted it, 
and back there had been Laura&#39;s revenge.

	Yep, that sounded accurate.

	&quot;Oh Great...&quot; She muttered sarcastically, &quot;I&#39;m purposely pissing 
off an assassin, because of stupid pride. Not good, I wonder is it too 
late to reverse the damage and start again?&quot; She recalled Mireille&#39;s 
face to her mind.

	Yep, defenitely too late. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Kirika was apprehensive, she had the distinct feeling that 
everything was quickly spiralling out of her control. It hadn&#39;t been 
part of the plan for Laura to do that! Admittedly, there hadn&#39;t been 
much of a plan when Kirika had rung the psychiatrist up and told her 
that she WAS going to play the part of her girlfriend, but still.... 

	The psychiatrist had been right about one thing, Mireille was 
defenitely angry.

	Furious, raging, her eyes were slits of the purest blue ice, her 
mouth was set in a snarl, she looked wild. Even her hair seemed to be 
falling in angry waves down her shoulders, the ends swaying accusingly 
in the wind. Her breathing was heavy and her hands were clenched into 
fists. 

	Yes, Mireille was angry all right. But beautiful too, it was all 
there, the wild passion, that determination, the iron will. She was 
perfect, an untamed force.

	And all of it was raging because of her! It was already making 
Kirika&#39;s breathing quicken, Mireille was furious at the thought of 
Kirika being with someone else, of not having Kirika for herself.

	It was intoxicating. Knowing that someone wanted you, and just 
you. So intoxicating it was almost smothering her, breathing was so 
hard.  She wanted so badly just to go up to Mireille and kiss her, she 
was sure it would be returned with such fierce passion.

	But no, she couldn&#39;t do it. Not and break the ruse. That would 
make Mireille furious at her. 

	And so she had to watch, sit and watch this enticing creature 
which wanted her so badly, they both wanted the same, she was sure of 
it! But Kirika couldn&#39;t be the one to initiate it. Damn, this was out of 
control, what if Mireille was heartbroken by what she might see as 
rejection? Or what if it angered her so much she left....?

	I shouldn&#39;t have done this, I shouldn&#39;t have. I could have been 
patient, let time run it&#39;s course... But I had to try and change it, had 
to try and speed things up, what a fool I&#39;ve been. 

	She lifted her face softly, instantly her eyes were met with those 
of the fiercest blue, aimed directly at her. She quickly looked away in 
shame and self loathing. 

	&quot;Kirika....&quot; The soft voice echoed, but she wouldn&#39;t look up, not 
and meet Mireille&#39;s eyes. &quot;Kirika...&quot; The voice encouraged, she didn&#39;t 
move. 

	Soft, cool fingers found her chin and lifted her face gently up 
until she was looking into Mireille&#39;s eyes again. They were still angry, 
but Kirika could sense that none of the anger was directed at her, just 
a deep forgiving. 

	Mireille&#39;s face moved forwards. Kirika felt her breath quicken in 
anticipation, she could already tasted Mireille&#39;s breath mixing with her 
own, her gaze went cloudy.

	&quot;Hey, I&#39;m back!&quot; A voice chirped happily, Mireille instantly 
dropped her hand and moved away with a faint blush. Kirika could have 
killed the psychiatrist for her timing. &quot;Am I interrupting anything?&quot;

	Mireille turned to the older woman, flashing her a smile which had 
about as much genuine friendliness in it as the fox&#39;s might for the hen.  
Kirika shifted away from the both of them, her assassin&#39;s instinct 
telling her to flee what even she would have no hope surviving. .... A 
cat fight. 

	&quot;Glad to see you&#39;re back, I missed you!&quot; Mireille exclaimed 
happily. Kirika recited the rest of the saying in her head. But I won&#39;t 
miss next time....

	&quot;Say Laura, how old are you?&quot; Mireille laced the question with 
innocence.

	&quot;Twenty six.&quot; The woman replied with a suspicious look, Mireille 
let out a small laugh.

	&quot;One foot in the grave, eh?&quot; Laura reddened in anger and Kirika 
swallowed a large lump in her throat. Mireille was defenitely trying to 
goad her into a fight, a fight which could only have one winner. 

	&quot;You must be at least as old as me, I thought you were older.&quot; 
Laura replied blithely, making Mireille splutter. Kirika winced, one 
thing Mireille cherished was her appearance. 

	&quot;I&#39;m twenty!&quot; She hissed angrily, &quot;Why would I look as old as 
you?&quot; Her eyes were filled with anger now, all outward attempts at 
friendliness now gone. 

	&quot;Really, you look much older.&quot; Laura&#39;s smile was victorious.

	&quot;At least I don&#39;t have to dye my hair, was the grey showing too 
much?&quot; Laura gasped and Kirika tried to move further away from the two 
of them. She noticed that all the tables around them were suspiciously 
empty. 

	&quot;Actually I just didn&#39;t want to look like another dumb blonde.&quot; 
The Corsican Blonde&#39;s eyes narrowed.

	&quot;Why you!!&quot; She started to rise, a phone began to ring. Kirika 
thanked whoever it was as Laura reached into her bag for the mobile, 
ignoring Mireille, who had by now sunk back into her seat. The woman 
chatted into the phone for a few seconds before hanging up and flashing 
them each a smile.

	&quot;Sorry I have to go. My husband needs to go out and he wants me to 
look after the kid.&quot; 

	Mireille&#39;s mouth fell open. 

	&quot;You&#39;re married!!!?&quot; Kirika sighed in purest relief, she would 
need to remember to send a hefty cheque in the  mail to that man for his 
excellent timing. 

	&quot;Yes, why?&quot; Laura asked with a faintly curious expression.

	&quot;I thought you and Kirika were....&quot; She trailed off, embarrassed. 
Laura turned to look at Kirika, winking slightly to her before 
continuing.

	&quot;Thought what....? I&#39;m her psychiatrist, that&#39;s all.&quot; She smiled 
at Kirika, who smiled back and set off, whistling for a cab. 

	Kirika turned back to Mireille, trying to hold in a smirk. The 
blonde had deflated like a punctured balloon. All her strength and anger 
leaving her as she slumped back in her seat, her face turning red enough 
to put a tomato to shame.

	&quot;You thought what?&quot; Kirika asked in her most innocent voice, it 
couldn&#39;t have come out very innocent however, as Mireille gave her a 
suspicious glance. Ignoring her, Mireille asked the next waiter to pass 
for the bill, and paid in silence. Rising to her feet and pulling her 
coat back over her shoulders. 

	They left the place in silence, Kirika trailing after Mireille as 
was customary and the blonde simply taking the lead. 

	&quot;Mireille....?&quot; Kirika opened, the blonde didn&#39;t turn to look at 
her but answered nonetheless.

	&quot;Hmm?&quot;

	&quot;Why were you so angry at her?&quot; Perhaps she was mistaken, but she 
thought she saw the blonde&#39;s back twitch. 

	&quot;I just didn&#39;t like her is all.&quot; Kirika nodded, not believing a 
word of it. Hesitantly she sidled up to Mireille and after a seconds 
pause slipped her hand into Mireille&#39;s own. 

	There was a moments pause in which Kirika thought Mireille would 
reject her show of affection, then the hand clamped closed, keeping hold 
of Kirika in a strong grip, a possessive grip, like the one she had 
slept in last night. Kirika smiled happily.

	For once in her life, she felt wanted.... Loved. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	An hour later found Mireille sat at her table in the main living 
area of their hotel room, sipping on a cup of tea. Kirika was in the 
shower and she herself was busy reading a letter that had arrived whilst 
they had been out.

	It was their job description. 

	She read it.

	&quot;No.... it can&#39;t  be....&quot; 


	Ooooohhhhhh Cliff hanger. Damn I&#39;m getting better at putting them 
in everywhere! Hope this was good enough for you all, I&#39;m a little 
unsure, but as I&#39;ve been told in reviews, I&#39;m way too critical. So I&#39;ll 
stop.
