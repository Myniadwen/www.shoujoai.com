The Chapter without a title, mark III.


	Mireille&#39;s ascent into then world of wakefulness was a slow and 
groggy one. Aided by the fact that their new sleeping room had no 
windows, and that the only light to be given would be from the lamp, 
which was now switched off, Mireille was able to forget for a moment 
that there were jobs to be done. But only for a few minutes. Her career 
had made her more of a high strung person, and the inactivity of laying 
in her bed all day would soon get on her nerves. Sighing she once again 
took stock of her situation. Kirika was as per usual snuggled against 
her side, her arms languidly draped over Mireille&#39;s waist. At least for 
once it was more of a weak embrace, and not the straddling hold that 
Kirika had been subjugating her to lately. Perhaps the girl was content 
enough with what had happened last night?

	Mireille blushed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she and Kirika had 
kissed. Well that wouldn&#39;t have bothered her, but it wasn&#39;t just a small 
friendly kiss that she might have bestowed upon Kirika. It had been a 
lover&#39;s kiss, a deep passionate meshing of lips that Mireille had quite 
frankly never ever thought of doing with her reserved partner. That 
Kirika had done so to her, and so ferociously... Mireille blushed... it 
disgusted her.... or at least she hoped that was what she was feeling. 
She knew that it should have. To be kissed by another woman so was.... 
well... wrong! It just wasn&#39;t normal.

	Sure she loved her small partner. The cute little girl was 
adorable, and Mireille could barely imagine living without her anymore. 
But she had never thought that it might turn to this, cute and adorable 
yes. But a lover? No, that&#39;s not the case anyway. Kirika is only acting 
this way because of the drug. When she&#39;s cured, it&#39;ll all end. 

	Yes, yes... that was the case. All this was due entirely to the 
drug, Merophoxyll, and not to Kirika&#39;s own desires. After all, the small 
Asian had never before shown any inclination of being... she tried to 
think of a nice way to say it, and failed.... gay. In fact, Kirika had 
made no inclination of having any interests at all in the matter of 
affections. At least not in the context that Mireille meant.

	Deciding that such thoughts were useless Mireille made to move 
away. Shifting her weight away from Kirika. A small sleepy growl came 
from behind her, and the arms around her waist tightened. Tough as steel 
the arms drew her back in and refused to budge. Mireille let out an 
exasperated sigh. Well, i guess i don&#39;t have anywhere i need to be. And 
it&#39;s not like Kirika is just going to let me go... Smiling slightly 
Mireille relaxed and leant back into Kirika. This making the still half 
asleep girl sigh in pleasure, and the arms soften again. 

	Strangely enough Mireille didn&#39;t feel worried or frightened by 
sleeping so close to the girl. Ever since she had known the effect of 
the drug on Kirika, sleeping had always been like a trial. But this 
morning she felt oddly peaceful, calm... Maybe it was the knowledge that 
Kirika wasn&#39;t exactly going to start groping her. She trusted the girl&#39;s 
self restraint that far at least. Besides, the girl was still mostly 
asleep. She was cute when she was asleep, mainly because lately, when 
she was awake, she was sex driven. But at this time of the day Mireille 
could relax, and not have to worry about what Kirika would do next. It 
was a pleasant change. 

	A loud creaking sound broke through her thoughts. 

	Kirika was up in an instant. All of a sudden Mireille was thrown 
back and the girl was flying from the bed towards the door, Mireille 
fell backwards off the bed from the girl&#39;s protective push. Scrambling 
on the floor she located a gun and rolled out from behind the heart 
shaped monstrosity called a bed. All her frustration, all her anger 
ready to release itself. She was thwarted. A dull thud was the only 
sound the man made as he collapsed to the floor, his head twisted beyond 
recognition. 

	Ten minutes later....

	Mireille was pacing angrily. Pacing the length and width of the 
living area. She was angry. Angry, annoyed, pissed off.... The room was 
twenty feet by fifteen.... furious! She stopped pacing, realizing that 
she was probably burning a hole into the carpet. 

	Kirika was sitting at the table, calmly sipping some tea. The 
action seemed ill-suited to her. A small Asian girl with sleep tussled 
hair, wearing a vest and some shorts, sitting calmly at a table drinking 
tea.

	&quot;What are we supposed to do with a dead body!&quot; Mireille exclaimed 
angrily, for what must have been the tenth time. As with the previous 
times Kirika didn&#39;t answer. Simply thinking to herself it seemed, this 
in turn angered Mireille, though she was unsure why. Better she be 
thinking about something else quietly than thinking about me obviously, 
her mind explained. But she was still annoyed. Who?! They had not been 
to America for ages, and they had certainly not left any enemies that 
would still be alive to tell the tale. Their client maybe? What would 
they gain from killing Noir? Nothing that Mireille could figure out, 
that was for sure.

	She started mumbling angrily, stalking around the room like an 
avenging spirit. She knew she was clenching her fists and her face was 
furious, but she didn&#39;t care. As long as she soon got the opportunity to 
kill something. Kirika smiled at her.

	&quot;You know you&#39;re cute when you&#39;re angry.&quot; Was the girl&#39;s helpful 
comment, followed by an insolent grin. Mireille scowled at her, fighting 
the blush that was rising on her cheeks. Since when did Kirika call her 
cute, wasn&#39;t it supposed to be the other way around? 

	Mireille walked off to deal with the body, dragging the recumbent 
form into a cupboard and locking the door behind her. She grabbed some 
air freshener from the side and sprayed it around the room, placing it 
by the door. She just hoped they were done before the week was out, or 
that corpse would soon become very smelly. After that she walked to the 
door and hung one of the signs on it. A red one detailing the cleaning 
staff not to enter, she hoped that it would keep them away. 

	Throughout it all Kirika remained at the table, idly sipping her 
tea whilst Mireille sweated to hide any traces of a fight in the room. 
The young girl seemed oblivious to Mireille&#39;s death stares. Mireille 
finished her chores alone, before sitting down heavily at the table and 
taking a long drink of some mineral water she had found in the fridge. 

	&quot;Are we going to see our client?&quot; Kirika asked curiously, Mireille 
shook her head.

	&quot;Later, I&#39;m too tired now, and we have to think. I mean was it 
them?&quot; She had at first suspected the Soldats, as she always did, but 
the man was not dressed like them. And defenitely not as skilled as 
them. 

	&quot;How would i know.&quot; Kirika reasoned. &quot;I don&#39;t even know the reason 
we&#39;re here. Don&#39;t give me that they have to run tests speech again. I 
know something&#39;s up, and I&#39;m going to find out what!&quot; Mireille raised 
her head to look Kirika in the eyes. The girl&#39;s face was determined. How 
can she not already tell? Mireille had to wonder, before dismissing the 
thought. Let Kirika try to figure it out, if she found the truth she 
might stop annoying Mireille. 

	&quot;Anyway, I&#39;m too tired to think.&quot; Mireille replied, resting her 
head on her arms.

	&quot;Shall we talk?&quot; Kirika asked, Mireille waved her hand, telling 
her to do what she wanted. &quot;Alright. Let&#39;s talk..... about last night.&quot; 
Mireille froze, like a deer in the headlights. It was said that average 
predators would pass you by if you stood perfectly still. Judging from 
the mischievous look Kirika was directing at her, Mireille had to 
conclude that Kirika wasn&#39;t an average predator. 

	&quot;What? You collected your promise, I went to sleep.&quot; Mireille 
replied off-handedly. Kirika&#39;s smile grew.

	&quot;Did you enjoy it?&quot; She asked evilly. Mireille&#39;s face was bland.

	&quot;How can anyone be asked whether they enjoyed being forced to do 
something? I had no choice in the matter.&quot; She wasn&#39;t going to lose this 
argument, and no way was she going to admit to Kirika that she had in 
fact been excited by it.

	&quot;You didn&#39;t exactly struggle though did you? And I felt you 
kissing me back...&quot; Kirika whispered with a wide grin on her face. 
Mireille knew that she was turning red.

	&quot;That was only because you threatened that you&#39;d do more if you 
weren&#39;t satisfied by it. I was still forced to. Or you might have made 
me do worse.&quot; Kirika seemed a little down put at Mireille&#39;s refusal to 
admit to her, perhaps the girl wanted to feel like she hadn&#39;t forced 
Mireille to?

	&quot;Do i get another tonight?&quot; Kirika asked, tilting her head to the 
side and smiling wolfishly. &quot;A goodnight kiss?&quot;

	&quot;No, but I&#39;ll give you a goodnight fist!&quot; Mireille threatened 
showing the girl her fist. The look in Kirika&#39;s eyes told her she was 
about to regret that comment.

	&quot;Mireille, I never knew you could be so forceful, chains and 
leather eh?&quot; She replied with a wicked smile. Mireille was too shocked 
to speak, she spluttered on her drink, turning a deep crimson.

	&quot;Bitch!&quot; Mireille snarled after she had calmed down, her face 
still glowing red with embarrassment. She couldn&#39;t believe Kirika had 
said that to her. The small girl was grinning and laughing to herself. 

	&quot;Come on!&quot; Mireille ordered, suddenly getting to her feet and 
pulling a jacket on to hide her embarrassment. &quot;We&#39;re off to see them 
now.&quot; Kirika stopped laughing and nodded, pulling her gun out of her 
pocket and loading it. Mireille noticed and did likewise. Whatever 
Kirika&#39;s thoughts were keyed towards, it was obvious from the dead man 
in the cupboard that she was still just as deadly as before. 


	This chapter hath hereby ended. What did you all think? Personally 
i didn&#39;t like it much, and felt that the conversation at the end was a 
bit much. I mean Kirika is OOC due to the drug, but that felt like too 
much. Never mind, it&#39;s my fic and she can be as stupid as she wants to 
be. lol. It was a filler chapter anyway. So there!
