<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>We pull up in front of the hotel. The traffic is back to normal, and we 
are able to get out of the limo without difficulty. My stomach still 
doesn&#39;t feel well, and I step carefully so as not to disturb it more. 
The lobby is the quietest I&#39;ve ever seen it; I&#39;m grateful for the calm 
as I gingerly make my way to the elevator.

&quot;Lady Bouquet?&quot; the concierge calls out. She runs from her desk over to 
us.

&quot;I&#39;ve a letter for you at the front desk. Shall I fetch it?&quot;

&quot;No- I&#39;ll get it myself. Thank you.&quot; Mireille answers smoothly and nods 
her head. There&#39;s no surprise in her voice- was she expecting this?

I watch as she walks quickly over to the desk.

&quot;I told you.&quot; Uncle says gravely. &quot;I told you he would write to her 
again.&quot;

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t show me the telegram.&quot; I don&#39;t dare mention the rest of 
the conversation to him. I watch as she opens the letter, and see 
several pictures fall out onto the floor. She bends over to scoop them 
up; I see the surprised look on her face as she glances at them. The 
look changes and I see her brow furrow as she reads, ignoring us 
completely.

&quot;He&#39;s dragging her into the past with him, feeding her hate. You must 
help me, Kirika.&quot; Uncle puts his hand on my shoulder. &quot;We cannot let her 
walk down the same path as Roland Bouquet.&quot;



Maybe later. That had been her reply once I&#39;d approached her at the desk 
and asked to see the pictures. I watch as she stands in the corner of 
the elevator, reading the letter again. The silence is uncomfortable to 
me, but she seems to not notice, or not care.

The doors open and we file silently out, each in our own thought. My 
stomach is giving me fits; I resolve to have some tea to try and settle 
it.

&quot;Marchaud. Anything?&quot; Uncle asks our hallyway sentinel.

&quot;Nothing. Very quiet.&quot; Marchaud replies &quot;Henry- care to switch up?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely. Go on in, I will take the door.&quot; Henry bows.

&quot;I&#39;m going to make tea, if anyone would like some.&quot; I say as I head into 
the kitchen.



We are all seated at the table, even Marchaud. He looks relieved to sit 
down- I think he may be even older than Uncle. As always, Mirielle and 
Uncle sit at opposite heads of the table. I wonder if they will ever get 
along, or always fight for leadership.

Mirelle carefully snaps shut her purse and shoves it aside to make room 
for her tea.

&quot;Droger sent me another letter. It was...very interesting.&quot; she taps her 
fingers on the table. I&#39;m relieved she&#39;s mentioned it; maybe now things 
will be better.

&quot;Were you at my father&#39;s wedding?&quot; she looks pointedly at Uncle. He 
glances quickly to Marchaud, who frowns.

&quot;I was in Italy at that time. My assignment kept me there for several 
years.&quot; Uncle replies. &quot;What does Droger have to say about it?&quot;

&quot;He says...he was the best man. And he sent a picture.&quot; Her voice drops 
a little with emotion. &quot;A picture of my parents...with him.&quot;

&quot;I think Droger is trying to manipulate you, Mireille.&quot; Uncle says 
gently. &quot;He may distort the truth for his own gain.&quot;

&quot;And of course Soldats would never do such a thing.&quot; Mireille snaps.

&quot;Mireille, please...&quot; I start, but she waves at me with her hand to be 
quiet.

&quot;Then tell me something.&quot; Her stare is directed back at Uncle. &quot;Is it 
true that when Droger came to you for help, you turned him in to the 
police for murder?&quot;

Uncle and Marchaud look at each other again. I start to feel nervous. I 
do not want to think that I cannot trust Uncle, not after all this.

&quot;It is a matter of perspective. I turned in someone who committed 
murder. There was no helping what that man had done. It was a horrible 
thing that could not be excused.&quot; Uncle&#39;s eyes narrow. &quot;It was an act of 
true dishonor.&quot;

&quot;And murder is honorable? Murder is murder- the end is the same. No one 
at this table has clean hands- no one.&quot; Mireille states firmly. &quot;There 
couldn&#39;t be another reason you had him locked away, could there?&quot;

&quot;Discussing the past is pointless!&quot; Marchaud interjects loudly and slams 
down his cup. &quot;Do you not realize that every day he has the book he 
grows stronger? Soon he will no longer just twist and bend you-&quot; he 
looks at Mireille, then picks up his napkin and rips it in half.

&quot;He will break you.&quot;
