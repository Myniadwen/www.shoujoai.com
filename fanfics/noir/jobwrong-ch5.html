<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 5 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>	PLEASE READ THIS!!! NOTICE! ALERT!!

       I shall now explain to you that this fanfic is an exercise in 
writing. An attempt to further my writing skills. In my other fic 
Children of the Night I know roughly how the story will progress and how 
the characters shall be written. However in this one I am still very 
much unsure, and you may have noticed how Kirika is practically changing 
every chapter, this is not just the effect of the drug but of my 
unpredictable writing. Please will you excuse me for this, and if you 
could suggest how you would like Kirika to be written in this fanfic. I 
will take the majority suggestion written in any reviews, so every one 
counts. And you have only yourself to blame if you don&#39;t like how she 
change due to suggestions. Please tell me why you want her to be so, as 
well. 
       
       	Thank you.

I can&#39;t think of any good chapter titles!!!

	&quot;Kirika will you please calm down!&quot; Mireille exclaimed in an 
annoyed voice. Kirika pouted and plopped herself down heavily in her 
plastic seat. Her arms crossed and her mouth down turned. Her eyes 
however were full of mischief. Mireille sighed, &quot;You&#39;re drawing 
attention to us.&quot; 

	It was true, although Mireille was trying to remain inconspicuous, 
as always, Kirika&#39;s jumping up and down, and her random fits of giggling 
were making people look their way. Most of them turned up their noses, 
at them. The action gravely insulting Mireille&#39;s pride. She&#39;d have 
responded, if she hadn&#39;t Kirika to deal with.... 

	&quot;Why are we going to America?&quot; Kirika asked in a high pitched 
curious voice. The voice a curious teen might use. Defenitely not the 
quiet, subdued voice Mireille was used to. But right now she&#39;s not the 
girl I know. I wonder, is this still Kirika, or has the drug replaced 
her personality entirely? Is this even the same person I risked my life 
for?

	&quot;Mireille? You said the stuff had no effect on me, so why are we 
going to America?&quot; This was more like her, the analytical mind that 
could pick out a flaw in Mireille&#39;s excuses.

	&quot;Well, Kirika,&quot; She was sorely tempted to say, &quot;Because you&#39;ve 
been drugged into a hyper annoying teenager who wants nothing more than 
to sleep with me. And I have to have you cured because I&#39;m beginning to 
freak out, since you&#39;ve started looking at me as if I&#39;m a tasty pastry.&quot; 

	&quot;They want to run  some tests on you anyway, just to make sure 
nothing bad happened. You drank a lot of it.&quot; One of the greatest skills 
of an assassin, being able to lie with a  perfectly straight face. 

	&quot;Okay! When&#39;s our flight?&quot; Mireille sighed and checked her watch, 
then looked up at the flight timetable there table was under. They were 
currently sitting in a small Hagen Dazs restaurant. 

	&quot;We board in thirty minutes.&quot; Mireille replied with a sigh. Not 
too soon in her opinion. Although the prospect of sitting in a cramped 
seat with a drugged up Kirika for eight to nine hours was hardly 
appealing. How the hell was she supposed to keep Kirika calm?? She had 
at first attempted to get first class tickets, but the waiting list was 
too long for Mireille to risk. A boat had been an option, then she could 
perhaps have controlled Kirika in the cabins. But again it would take 
too long for Mireille&#39;s sanity. 

	So commercial airlines it was. And what a nightmare the day had 
been so far. Kirika had been pathetic in her attempts to avoid this by 
sleeping. Shrugging and mumbling when Mireille had tried to wake her, 
and once awake, falling asleep again almost instantly. Never had she 
known Kirika to be such a sleepy head! 

	The car journey.... All of a sudden Kirika had been completely 
awake and seemed to want to discuss everything to Mireille. Mireille now 
knew more about Kirika than she had ever intended to find out. Her 
favourite colour was blue, her favourite animal was cats, her dream was 
to be a normal person, and an artist. Her hobby, drawing. The list was 
endless, as were her questions about Mireille. She too had ended up 
divulging more information than she had ever intended. It was just so... 
tiresome. As much as she had always wanted Kirika to talk more, now she 
wished she&#39;d taken that thought and throttled it!

	&quot;Mireille. Can I get an ice cream?&quot; Kirika begged, giving her 
puppy dog eyes. Mireille  sighed but relented before the argument ever 
began. Simply reaching into her purse and handing Kirika some euros. The 
small girl squealed in delight and threw her arms around Mireille, 
before snatching the money and running away. Mireille sat where she was, 
her mind playing back that awful squeal of delight.

	Kirika.... squealing?..... Mireille was disturbed. (As is the 
Author, 0.o)



	&quot;Wheee! Look at the clouds! It&#39;s like a sea!!!&quot; Mireille felt like 
crying. She was tired, embarrassed, stressed and her nerves were far 
from calm. She had tried to calm her down, tried to fall asleep and 
escape everyone&#39;s disapproving stares. But Kirika wouldn&#39;t let her be 
boring. She truly felt like crying. In a despair filled kind of way.

	&quot;Kirika, please...&quot; She was interrupted.

	&quot;Ahh, Mireille don&#39;t be boring!&quot; Mireille sighed again, leaning 
back as Kirika leaned across her and pressed her face to the window of 
the plane. Why won&#39;t she accept the window seat? She thought to herself, 
if she was so damn interested in the scenery?

	&quot;Excuse me. Can you please keep your child quiet.&quot; A dignified 
French woman behind them huffed angrily. Normally Mireille would have 
bit her head off, but this time she agreed with her. Unfortunately 
Kirika came to the rescue. 

	&quot;I&#39;m not her child, I&#39;m her partner!!&quot; Kirika answered happily, 
smiling at the now shocked woman. Mireille groaned. Someone else, not 
Kirika this time, giggled. Mireille dragged Kirika down harshly so that 
the girl&#39;s eyes were meeting her own.

	&quot;Don&#39;t say that!&quot; She hissed angrily at Kirika, who in turn gave 
her a look of adoration. One that scared Mireille slightly. 

	&quot;But we are partners.&quot; Kirika answered back, thankfully this time 
in a lower voice. Mireille blushed slightly at Kirika&#39;s naivet&#130; but 
ploughed bravely on.

	&quot;Yes, in our job! But they thought we were lovers-&quot;   

	&quot;Aren&#39;t we?&quot; Kirika interrupted, her eyes piercing into Mireille&#39;s 
own. Mireille felt her mouth drop open at her words. Wha-wha-

	&quot;What!? I don&#39;t -what do you...&quot; Mireille stuttered, lost for 
words. Kirika leaned closer, making Mireille shuffle back against the 
wall of the plane.

	&quot;You risked your life to save me, and rescued me even though I 
wanted to die. After all this, are you trying to say you don&#39;t love me?&quot; 
Kirika&#39;s voice was thankfully low. The woman behind them was obviously 
satisfied with their volume so luckily heard nothing. Mireille mumbled.

	&quot;I do love you Kirika. As a friend.&quot; She answered, embarrassed to 
say it, but it was true, and she thought that Kirika needed to hear it. 
Perhaps also it would put a curb on Kirika&#39;s blatant actions. It seemed 
she was mistaken. 

	Kirika leaned in, her face scant inches from Mireille&#39;s own, her 
brown eyes piercing. Mireille tried to back up further but found no more 
room to run. She jumped as Kirika&#39;s hand touched her leg and her body 
pressed against Mireille&#39;s own. Making her desires perfectly clear. Oh 
My God! Mireille panicked, No, no, no. She can&#39;t be doing this to me I&#39;m 
a world renowned assassin!! 

	&quot;Only as a friend?&quot; Kirika whispered seductively in Mireille&#39;s 
ear, her warm breath on her lobe sending conflicting emotions through 
Mireille&#39;s body. She shivered. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

	&quot;...Kirika... please don&#39;t...&quot; She whispered, hardly believing 
that Kirika was doing this to her, it just wasn&#39;t something Kirika would 
do. Deciding to end this quickly Mireille placed her hands on Kirika&#39;s 
shoulders and tried to force the girl away. It might as well have been 
like pushing away a mountain for all the use it did. She started 
shaking, she had never realised Kirika was so strong before, how 
helpless she herself was. 

	&quot;Why not?... You know you&#39;ll enjoy it...&quot; Kirika whispered back to 
her, making Mireille jump. Enjoy it... probably, she wasn&#39;t afraid to 
admit it. But it was just not something she wanted. Not with Kirika, not 
like this, and certainly not on a commercial plane packed full of 
tourists!!

	&quot;Kirika no!&quot; She asserted herself, trying to keep her voice 
strong. &quot;I will not let you do this, and you are not so heartless as to 
take it!&quot; She was sure of that. If even the smallest part of the old 
Kirika remained then she would not do such a thing against Mireille&#39;s 
will. 

	&quot;Make me an offer.&quot; Kirika answered, moving her head down and 
breathing warm breath onto Mireille&#39;s neck. Normally Mireille would have 
been furious at such a suggestion, but to make Kirika stop this now...

	&quot;If you behave yourself for the rest of the flight...&quot; Mireille 
blurted out, she jumped and tried to shift her weight as she felt 
Kirika&#39;s hand caress her thigh. If there wasn&#39;t such a distraction she 
might have thought about her offer more carefully. Which was probably 
Kirika&#39;s plan. &quot;I&#39;ll kiss you when we get to the hotel.&quot; Mireille 
finished in a rush, breathing a relieved sigh when Kirika pulled slowly 
away. Her eyes were full of mischief, and her smile said that she had 
won the battle. Mireille was breathing hard.

	&quot;A proper one.&quot; Kirika conditioned, Mireille knew there was no 
arguing, she nodded. &quot;And if it&#39;s not good enough, then I get to make my 
own condition.&quot; Again Mireille nodded, wondering just what she was 
getting herself into.  What have I done. What have I just agreed to 
do....


	Okay, so this was an extremely crude chapter. Very crude. I&#39;m 
sorry to all who were looking for sophistication. Though why you thought 
to find it in a fic about Kirika being in heat I don&#39;t know. Well, it 
wasn&#39;t there. Sorry to all for the basic crudidity (my new word!)  I&#39;m 
still learning how to write humour fics. (So much harder than normal 
ones!)
