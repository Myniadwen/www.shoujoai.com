<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Chloe awoke with a start, jolting upright in her bed. Or, as upright as 
she could get before her head collided with another solid object.

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Kirika sat on the floor where she had landed, rubbing her own 
forehead.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Chloe stuttered, getting out of the bed, rubbing her own 
head, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Kirika smiled and took Chloe&#39;s offered hand, rising to her 
feet, &quot;Why are you still asleep, it&#39;s nearly mid-morning.&quot;

Chloe rubbed her eyes with her sleeve and looked toward the window where 
the sun was shining brightly through, &quot;I guess I just slept in. Is 
Althena angry?&quot;

Kirika shook her head and took her friend&#39;s hand, towing her down the 
stairs and out into the bright light.

Chloe&#39;s eyes opened slowly and she sat up in her bed. She sighed softly, 
her mind attempting to grab hold of the bits of the dream which still 
remained in her memory. Why couldn&#39;t things be like that anymore? Why 
did Kirika have to forget? Why couldn&#39;t she come back and everything 
would be just like it used to be? A single tear snuck out of the young 
assassin&#39;s eye as she fell back into a troubled sleep.

&quot;Althena, when are we going home?&quot; Chloe tugged at the older woman&#39;s 
sleeve and whispered her inquiry, trying not to disturb the men talking 
amongst themselves at the other end of the room.

&quot;Patience, Chloe, good things come to those who wait,&quot; Althena chided, 
taking the young girl&#39;s hand in her own and walking towards the men at 
the other end of the room.

Yes, good things, Chloe smiled, When we get back Kirika will be there 
and we will go on more missions. I wish she could have come on this one. 
I miss her already. I want to go back to the Manor and see her.

The young girl kicked in her bed and rolled over, attempting to find 
reprieve from her restless sleep, but it would not come.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Chloe called as soon as they entered the Manor. Althena hung 
her traveling coat on a coat rack nearby as Chloe dashed up the stairs, 
seeking her best friend, her other half, &quot;Kirika, we&#39;re home! Where are 
you? . . .&quot; She wasn&#39;t in the East wing. &quot;Kirika!?&quot; Not in the West 
wing. &quot;Kirika?!&quot; Not in her room.

&quot;KIRIKA!?&quot; Chloe screamed, jolting awake, her heart racing, her breath 
ragged. After a moment Chloe wiped the sweat from her brow and slumped 
her shoulders.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; The soft voice came from the other side of the door, 
&quot;Did you call?&quot;

Kirika? She must have heard me, Chloe chewed her lip for a moment, 
mulling over whether to invite the other girl in or not, &quot;I, I&#39;m fine. 
You must have been dreaming,&quot; she called back faintly and fell back onto 
her pillow. It was several moments before Chloe heard her old friend&#39;s 
footsteps retreat from her door back to her own room. Chloe smiled 
slightly, She was always so worried about me.

Her smile slowly slipped away as she remembered the dream that had 
caused her to cry out for the girl, I still don&#39;t even know what 
happened. If only I knew what happened, maybe I could help you remember, 
Kirika. Maybe I could make it so we could be together again.

Mireille squinted at the overhanging of her bed. She&#39;d heard Chloe 
arrive a few hours before, after everyone else had fallen asleep. She&#39;d 
heard the assassin stop at Kirika&#39;s door a moment before passing on down 
the corridor. The Corsican had contemplating giving the girl a piece of 
her mind then and there, but had withdrawn. What on earth would she have 
said?

After several hours had passed and she had finally found sleep she had 
been awoken by a cry, the girl calling out for her friend, her love. 
Mireille chewed a bit on her thumbnail, And Kirika went to her. And she 
stood outside Chloe&#39;s door. Like Chloe had stood outside of hers. God, 
I&#39;ve known Kirika longer that Chloe has, why are they like that?! I 
wonder, if I had cried out for her like that, would she have come to my 
door? Would she have even cared?

Oh, come on, you&#39;re being melodramatic, Mireille scolded herself, It 
doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s door she goes to in the middle of the night because 
when this is all over she&#39;s coming back home to Paris with me. This 
Chloe girl is just some minor distraction. Kirika is a very kind person, 
naturally she&#39;s worried if such a young child, a girl, screams. There&#39;s 
nothing odd about it.</pre>
