<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 17 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>In the kitchen, in the apartment in France that they both shared, 
Mireille Bouquet was silently cooking breakfast. An omelette for each of 
them. Normally they ate lightly in the morning, perhaps a croissant or 
some fruit, but she felt that Kirika needed the sustenance.

Kirika was still in bed. Not sleeping, Mireille was sure. Not moving 
either, simply staring at the ceiling, in a depressed haze of guilt and 
self loathing. Leaning on the side for support Mireille let out a deep 
sigh. It was hurting her too.

Not what the drug had done, that was over and done with. She had been 
deeply embarrassed to know how she had acted, and perhaps it had left a 
thorn between them. A lack of trust, that whenever they looked at each 
other, they wondered if the other was going to jump them.

It was Kirika who was hurting her. This lack of communication, the way 
she stared hopelessly, the look of pain on her face. It hurt Mireille to 
look at her. Why couldn&#39;t they just act like it had never happened, why 
couldn&#39;t they go back to how they had been. Damn it, Mireille had been 
affected too, but she didn&#39;t blame herself, it was Edwin and Merophoxyll 
who had done it!

The omelette was done, the edges burned slightly as she fought within 
herself. Muscles weak with depression herself, Mireille scooped out the 
omelette and placed it on a plate for Kirika, and one more for herself. 
She laid them on the table and poured out some orange juice, doing all 
she could to put off that moment.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; She called hesitantly, afraid that the small Asian might 
rebuff her attempts to feed her. Kirika hadn&#39;t been eating recently, and 
not sleeping much either. Wasting away in front of her eyes.

&quot;What.&quot; A voice replied emotionlessly. It wasn&#39;t a question, nor a 
statement, just words that held no meaning. But today, Mireille wasn&#39;t 
playing this game.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; She called again, rattling the utensils to alert Kirika to 
what she meant.

There was silence. Dragging on for minutes before a soft mumble came 
from behind the partition, followed by the footsteps of a small girl.

Kirika looked dead. Her face seemed pale and miserable and the way she 
walked suggested a lack of will involved. Her eyes were the soulless 
empty red orbs she had first known her to have.

Mireille was heartbroken.

The girl sat at the table and silently picked up her knife and fork, 
eating the omelette with a cold precision. Focusing all her attention on 
the slightly burnt egg and leaving none for Mireille...

&quot;Kirika...&quot; Mireille sighed, but the girl didn&#39;t look up. Simply putting 
down her knife and fork and rising to leave again, never a word uttered.

Mireille got to her feet quickly, leaving her meal half finished.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; She shouted angrily, halting the girl in her tracks. An empty 
face turned to regard her.

&quot;Kirika, this has to stop! There is nothing to be ashamed about, this 
wallowing in guilt is ridiculous, it&#39;s destroying you, and I don&#39;t want 
that! I was affected just like you, and I&#39;m not killing myself over it, 
so this ends now!&quot; Mireille finished on a command, hoping that her 
speech might break through Kirika&#39;s stubborness and reach her mind.

The girl turned and began to walk away again, never once showing 
emotion, nor making any move to answer her...

Mireille&#39;s breathing hitched...
Kirika turned around and walked away, barely hearing the words that 
Mireille had shouted at her. How could Mireille understand? How could 
she know what Kirika really felt? Her anger had a lot to do with the 
drug, and how she had acted, but more about how she herself had taken 
it.

Never once had she fought the on come of the drug within herself. Never 
once. The entire time she had accepted it within herself, as an emotion. 
Kirika now realised how strange she had been acting, how had she not 
noticed at the time?

&quot;Why are you doing this to me...?&quot; A cracked voice whispered from behind 
her, filled with hurt, an immeasurable pain and suffering. Kirika 
stopped immediately, Mireille was hurt. She didn&#39;t want Mireille to be 
hurt... She turned around slowly.

Mireille was there, on her knees. Her legs splayed out to either side as 
her head was bowed, and her hands meeting on the floor in front of her. 
Kirika could see the tears falling down onto those hands.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; She whispered quietly, afraid of what she would hear, hating 
herself even more for doing this to Mireille. She was truly a monster.

&quot;Why are you hurting me so...?&quot; The blonde whispered through her tears. 
Kirika was shivering, she didn&#39;t want to hurt Mireille, she hated seeing 
her partner in such pain. &quot;You don&#39;t talk anymore, you don&#39;t sleep, I&#39;m 
afraid of what I&#39;ll see when I look at you, you&#39;ll die! I don&#39;t want you 
to die...&quot; The huddled form of her partner was rocking slightly, wracked 
by sobs as she so obviously sought to control her pain, to hide it from 
Kirika. To be strong...

&quot;I&#39;m... sorry...&quot; She answered uselessly, Mireille shook her head 
violently.

&quot;You&#39;re not, you keep blaming yourself, and when you do that it hurts 
me! I don&#39;t blame you Kirika, why can&#39;t we just go back to living like 
normal?&quot; Kirika couldn&#39;t answer that. Because even though I&#39;m cured, I 
still feel the same love for you. Whilst I feel this, we can never go 
back to normal.

Kirika knelt before her partner, trying to look into her eyes, but 
Mireille would not meet her eyes, staring down at her hands which were 
rapidly becoming soaked with salty tears.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you Mireille. But I can&#39;t forgive myself for what 
I did to you. At every step I forced myself on you, tried to make you do 
what you didn&#39;t want to do. It was rape. I was raping you...&quot; There were 
tears in her own eyes now, running down her own cheeks. How could she 
have done that to Mireille, the woman she loved?

&quot;It wasn&#39;t rape...&quot; Mireille managed to get out from between her sobs. 
Hesitantly, afraid that she might be overstepping herself, Kirika 
reached out and placed a hand on Mireille&#39;s shoulder. A moment later and 
the blonde had latched onto her, crying into her shirt as she sobbed and 
shivered.

Kirika&#39;s eyes were wide. Mireille had always been the strong one, the 
one who was in control. Kirika had thought that nothing could hurt her. 
To know, that yet again, it was herself who could bring pain to others, 
but this time to the one person she only wanted to be happy...

&quot;It wasn&#39;t rape...&quot; Mireille repeated again, looking up into Kirika&#39;s 
brown eyes. Kirika felt her heart twist as she looked at Mireille&#39;s 
eyes, they were filled with so much pain, as well as something else.

&quot;It can&#39;t be rape, unless I was unwilling.&quot; Kirika looked down shocked.

&quot;What? Mireille, I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

Mireille looked back up to her eyes again, she almost looked to be 
fighting to say something.

&quot;Although I never realised it, I came to understand... that... I want.. 
you too. Kirika, I love you...&quot;

Kirika released her and stepped back, shivering violently. Someone was 
hyperventilating, it took her a moment to realise it was herself.

&quot;You don&#39;t mean that...&quot; She whispered, unwilling to believe Mireille 
had said it, afraid it might be a dream. Mireille was on her feet too, 
an arm outstretched to her in pleading.

&quot;I love you Kirika...&quot; She sobbed, &quot;please tell me you feel the 
same...please..&quot; She was begging, her voice showing how much this meant 
to her. Kirika rushed her, almost knocking her to the floor as she 
latched onto the woman&#39;s body in a tight hug. Crying her heart out into 
the blonde woman&#39;s breast. There were soft hands on her head, stroking 
her hair soothingly as she was rocked slowly.

&quot;I love you Mireille! I love you!&quot; She cried loudly into the woman, 
unwilling to let go, terrified that she might open her eyes, and wake up 
with Mireille sleeping next to her as always. Just another cruel dream.

Wet hands fumbled for her cheeks, pulling her face up into a kiss pent 
full of frustration. Wrestling all their pain out of them as they clung 
to each other in tears. Two professional assassins, the best of the 
best, the only ones who could ever hurt them were themselves.

Mireille manoeuvred them to the bed, sitting down without once breaking 
the kiss, never once stopping from touching each other. Neither wanted 
to break that contact.

Kirika smiled through her tears as she felt Mireille pulling the top 
from her, stripping her whilst still kissing her.

&quot;If you want me to stop...&quot; Mireille whispered, pulling away for a 
single second, &quot;Then you just have to tell me...&quot; Kirika smiled as she 
reached up and pulled Mireille in for another deep kiss.

&quot;I don&#39;t. Mireille, I don&#39;t want you to ever stop loving me.&quot; Hands 
wrapped around her neck as Mireille answered into Kirika&#39;s own mouth.

I never will.
Kirika snuggled deeper into Mireille, feeling spent, and yet happy. She 
looked up into Mireille&#39;s flushed face and smiled happily, all previous 
guilt and misery gone.

&quot;You are my first.&quot; Kirika whispered to her lover, liking the way 
Mireille smiled happily.

&quot;You&#39;re mine too.&quot; She replied with a tender smile, Kirika shook her 
head quickly.

&quot;No, I meant first ever, not first woman.&quot; Mireille&#39;s eyes narrowed 
dangerously.

&quot;So did I, Kirika...&quot;

&quot;What! Really!&quot; Kirika gasped, truly shocked, a second later and she 
realised she may have made a small mistake.

&quot;Yes! What do you mean &quot;Really&quot;?&quot; Mireille asked, her eyes mere slits as 
she searched for the answers in Kirika&#39;s blushing face.

&quot;Umm... I... Uhhh... assumed... ehhh...&quot; Kirika mumbled, searching for 
anything she could say to get herself out of this situation. Mireille 
watched her with an exasperated expression.

&quot;Kirika...&quot; She sighed in an exasperated tone, the small Asian kept on 
mumbling excuses.

&quot;Uhhh,... well... ummm... ehhhhh...&quot;

&quot;Ah, Ferme ta bouche et embrasse moi!&quot; (Oh, just shut up and kiss me!) 
Mireille cried out.

Kirika smiled as she happily complied.
