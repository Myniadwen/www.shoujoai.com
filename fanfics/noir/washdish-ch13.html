<a href="../noir/washdish-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The ringing escalates and Mireille clambers sleepily over top of me, 
accidentally squashing my breast with her elbow.

&quot;Ow....&quot;

&quot;Sorry. What time is it?&quot; she mutters, grabbing her cell phone.

&quot;Hello? Oh, Anton! What? That&#39;s impossible! It&#39;s only-&quot; she holds the 
phone away from her to read its clock. Her mouth drops open in surprise.

&quot;Um, we ... lost track of time. We were so busy!&quot; she nods her head 
vigorously and I break out in a smile.

&quot;Doing? Well.....we were...washing the dishes.&quot;

I snort and roll over as she swats me.

&quot;Well...we had let them pile up for a long time...you know how that is. 
You just have a whole lot to do at once.&quot; Her body is shaking as she 
tries not to laugh.

&quot;What? Ok, wait.&quot; She hands the phone to me. &quot;He wants to talk to you.&quot;

I take a deep breath to compose myself, and take the phone from her.

&quot;Hello Anton.&quot; I try to sound calm, or however one sounds when doing 
dishes.

&quot;Little bit, you&#39;re not in the kitchen, are you?&quot; his voice is teasing. 
How does he know?

&quot;Not really.&quot; I bite my lip, not sure what to say. I can feel Mireille 
watching me.

&quot;So just tell me one thing- how is she?&quot;

&quot;Mireille is an excellent dishwasher.&quot; I reply, and hand the phone back 
to her. I can hear him laughing, and the pillow slamming into my face 
tells me I&#39;ve probably said the wrong thing, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve 
never been happier, in my life, than I am with Mireille, washing the 
dishes.</pre>
