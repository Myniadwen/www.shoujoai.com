<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Mireille ran, dashed, and forced to increase the speed in her feet with 
all she might. She kept running, running, and running. Night had fallen 
; the sky was dark, the moon barely lit the way, and the path&#39;s 
surrounding was not much clearer. The Corsican girl halted slightly when 
her vision caught the sight of a bridge. Collecting her breath, Mireille 
crossed it, and continued her venture.

How she finally set her foot upon the street of the small town whose 
appearance bright by lights, she did not know. How such town would 
exist, she did not want to ask. How the first place that she saw right 
away was the inn, noisy and lively right on her left, she cared not. All 
she knew was that she wanted, and need to rest.

----------

Mireille Bouquet slowly blinked her eyes in a lazy motion, adapting her 
sense to the unfamiliar morning sunlight. Her body felt stiff, tough 
better after she laid on the soft, bouncy stuff she was now resting in. 
Her left arm - wounded, cold, aching, - was apparently felt cold despite 
the thick, tickling blanket she had used to cover her body since the 
night. Realizing the next day had come, the blonde sat up on her bed. 
She searched for her gun worriedly, hold it tightly, and looked at her 
surrounding.

She was practically sitting on a bed, in a small, simple white-painted 
room. Small window - a curtain-less one - hung right on her left beside 
the bed, illuminating the yellow strays of light from the sun. At the 
deeper part in the room, a bathroom whose door kept ajar existed. So far 
all was normal ; Mireille did not spot anything or anyone suspicious in 
her room. Slowly, the Corsican girl lowered her gun and somehow began to 
like the room she was in. Regardless of the dusty furniture, dirty 
tiles, and the old ceilings, Mireille found the room was nice, 
relaxingly quiet, and comfortable enough.

Despite the coldness in the room, Mireille&#39;s clothes plugged sticky on 
her body due to the sweat on it. It was supposed to be a good sign from 
her fever had her vision not abruptly went blurry, then black for a 
while. Fortunately, after a few times blinking and some shook on her 
head, she came back to see things vividly afterwards. Her fatigue had 
gradually recovered during the time, tough the fever proved to insist in 
troubling her, despite the sweating. Mireille put the blanket on and 
leaned her back to a white, soft pillow.

Mireille slipped her hand inside her pocket, and let out the white 
envelope which had been ripped slightly last night due to the urgent 
circumstances. Last night - desperate, exhausted, and confused - the 
Corsican girl broke the envelope&#39;s seal and open it, which was a 
fortunate action as she found money in it, and without much more 
thinking, rent a room.

Sleepy and weary as she was yesterday, Mireille had not yet analyzed the 
rest of the envelope, as she fall asleep right the moment her head 
rested in bed. Now, holding the thick envelope with one hand, the blonde 
poured the envelope&#39;s contain onto the bed&#39;s surface. Thick as the 
envelope was, she saw a sufficient amount of money - mostly yen &#150; and 
some piece of papers. The blonde ignored the money and took the papers, 
unfolded them, and begun to read.

Dear Mireille.

At the first word, the blonde raised her eyebrows slightly. She never 
expected Chloe to write a letter for her. Curious for what reason, the 
Corsican girl read further.

If you got the chance to read this letter, one thing is sure. Our 
runaway was not as smooth as I hoped to be. However, whatever your 
condition is now I believe you are healthy, and out of danger enough to 
read my letter. In this very same envelope you will find some money 
which I have prepared intentionally for you to use as effective as you 
can. Above anything else, I must convince you to rest and regain your 
strength before you do anything reckless, whatever it may be. If you 
have managed to rest in the inn at the town I told you, you can rest 
assured, and relax for a while. No matter how powerful Soldats are, they 
must behave to other people, which was why you better hide in a town, a 
public place. But remember that they also might be sneaky, so you better 
keep watching your back. There is not a single place in the world that 
is perfectly safe.

I am writing this letter, hoping that this may mainly serves the purpose 
of my absence possibility in telling you what has happened until now. 
Now, I will explain the situation you are currently facing. Soldats had 
grown into a powerful company during the time. Based from the 
information I sought, they had perpetually cooperated with many 
industries, or companies, which I had not yet gotten the reason for what 
purpose when I told you about Naomi the first time. Soldats had trapped 
me, saying some particular plan, which was nothing but fake. When I knew 
and realized that, it had been too late to inform you because both of 
you had agreed to just come to Japan. It was partly my fault that you 
and Kirika were trapped in their plan. And I apologized for that. To 
make up for it, I have ceaselessly been investigating since then. The 
result is surprising, but now I am pretty sure that I have truly 
discovered one of their desires, at least the one involving you and 
Kirika.

Selfish as they were, Soldats seem to have some desire to dominate the 
world in their own way. Somehow, Soldats had quite raising their 
knowledge, and increasing their ability specifically at medical field to 
gain this dream of theirs. They hire, cooperate and join alliance with 
brilliant doctors. Soldats want to have something strong, different, 
something that will make them formidable enough to dominate the world so 
they will have no fear against anything. In order to succeed, they 
somehow choose to study those medical things.

I don&#39;t understand their way of thinking as well, but here that they 
began to think of a plan regarding you and Kirika. Apparently, they 
still think the two of you as their main threat. At first I&#39;m sure that 
they thought you two must be eliminated from the world for their sake of 
success. But somehow, their plan changed. If you have not realized, they 
have been watching Kirika, studying her all the time instead of trying 
to kill her. That, was because Soldats changed their tactics and 
switched from eliminating the enemies to using that enemy. For short, 
they want Kirika to be their main weapon. Only Kirika. You are not 
wanted.

Why Kirika? I jump to a conclusion that Kirika have something really 
special inside her, something Soldats interested in. It is not something 
that special in fact, but according to them, she seems to have the 
greatest possibility above anyone else to serve their goal.

I know how this information will make you angry right after you read it, 
but you must keep reading. Maybe now you are questioning whether why I 
came to you first instead of Kirika? The answers are: First, Kirika is 
strictly guarded in a special room I can&#39;t get close to without a 
thoughtful plan. Soldats have treated her differently, which is not 
likely to be in a good way. From what I heard, Kirika is being kept 
unconscious all the time for some reason. Why I didn&#39;t tell you this 
faster was to avoid the possibility, which was almost certain that you 
would go mad uncontrollably and go rescue Kirika recklessly. I don&#39;t 
want you to do that. It&#39;s far too risky with your condition. Now that 
you know how precious Kirika is to them, despite all their treatment and 
selfish will, you got to believe me for saying that she isn&#39;t going to 
be killed. The other reason of why I saved you first is that you are 
also the key to their horrible project.

All people have this two sides within them; the good one, and the bad 
one. Somehow, Soldats had investigated those kind of things, and finally 
discovered a way to &#39;activate&#39; another side which is less dominating in 
life than the other. Another plan of them is to activate the dark side 
of Kirika which they acknowledged as a &#39;special&#39; one.

Literally, one will definitely turn bad when someone hurt their feeling, 
or done something wrong. A proper action is the only one needed to lead 
someone into that kind of state. This, I believe is when you take part. 
Using you, the special person for Kirika, somehow will inflict Kirika&#39;s 
deep, sensitive feeling. Soldats will do something bad to you, horrible 
enough to disrupt Kirika&#39;s calm and turned her mad. They want to hurt 
Kirika mentally, instead of the common physical harm. My guess, Soldats 
will kill you, the precious person in Kirika&#39;s life, disgracefully, 
terribly, and exactly right in front of her.

When Kirika sees you died in front of her very own eyes, I&#39;m pretty sure 
myself that she will jump out, chasing, and kill the perpetrator. It is 
almost certain that she will lose her composure and her dark side may 
pop out, even just the slightest bit. The outrage effect is what they 
seek because it may &#39;activate&#39; the dark side of a person, which will 
ease their project.

Why? What for? Soldats want to form a formidable weapon. It is kind of 
abnormal that their choice of a perfect weapon somehow fell upon a 
living being weapon, tough. It is still a guess, but Kirika will likely 
be raised into a killing machine, using her &#39;special&#39; dark side.

Mireille stopped reading, despite her stern gaze that still fallen upon 
the very text she had been reading for a while. The last sentence she 
read had turned out to be the best shocking, compare with the other 
astonishing information she had just absorbed from the letter in the 
last two minutes. Soldats, Naomi, Chloe, the plan, weapon, Kirika.. All 
thoughts mixed up in her mind. Fury begun to rage inside her; her blue 
eyes flamed in anger, the paper in her hands shaking, as well as her 
hands.

How dare you.. Naomi.

Mireille&#39;s mind was full of fury. The plan, if what Chloe said was true, 
was absolutely terrible. Had she been in the Japanese girl&#39;s position, 
she definitely could not stand the thought of her lover dying right in 
front of her two bare eyes. Just by imagining the vision of the dearest 
person in her life was dying, weak, screaming for help, suffering from 
whatever killing her was painful and torturing. There was little doubt 
that Mireille would not go rampage, wild, brutal in every way she found 
possible. She believed that she would definitely chase anyone 
responsible &#150; the perpetrator of it &#150; until she was satisfied enough to 
stop. She would seek revenge until the last breath of her life, that one 
was sure. And also there was no telling how dark, impulsive, menacing, 
and dangerous she would be.

Mireille shook her head, vanishing the horrible thought of her dark 
self. She had come to realize the feeling of anger, fear, hatred, even 
doubt, which had been flaring even more vigorously inside her since she 
knew the content of the letter. How could one be such a bastard, a 
maniac to turn a human into a weapon? A killing machine? Too many things 
had gone wrong. And too many things she failed to do and missed to act. 
The blonde&#39;s jaw unconsciously tightened, and her gaze hardened. Her 
patience had been overloaded; it was nearly reached the limit. She 
really wanted to rush to Naomi&#39;s annoying base, marched in with full gun 
shot at whoever she met inside, or even bombed them to dust. She would 
kill anyone necessary. She would not care who stood in the way. Anyone. 
For there was no way she would let the Japanese girl used as a weapon. 
And no way would she let Kirika be used by Soldats. Never as long as she 
kept alive.

Mireille was about to get up and got ready, but above all her anger, her 
fury, and her feeling, her dignity succeeded in kicking in. Deep in the 
heart, the blonde knew that just insisting was not enough. She would 
need to prepare an exact action, in a proper condition. Mireille heaved 
out a desperate sigh. Her wounds had not yet recovered, let alone been 
treated ; it was left ignorantly ever since it was still bleeding for 
the first time until it felt like freezing and dead stiff like now. 
Moreover, her head still felt a bit dizzy, and it was very likely that 
she was still suffering from the fever last time as her whole body was 
sweating, but felt cold at the same time. Her current condition would 
not do. She had to rest ; one other day might suffice. A little 
disappointed for her delayed vengeance and her pity condition, Mireille 
let her gaze once again focused on the letter as she began to read on 
the rest of the letter.

If Kirika really turn into her dark self, my next prediction is that 
Soldats will then prepare some kind of drug from their best doctor and 
somehow shot it inside her or any other bad things to control Kirika 
right away. Or with their high abnormal technology medical knowledge, 
they may analyze Kirika&#39;s mental condition at that raging time, extract 
it, and somehow discover a drug or medicine which can be used to raise 
Kirika back instantly into &#39;that&#39; species. In my opinion, the second 
option is more plausible.

Now I believe that you are quite aware of what position you are in, and 
what condition you are facing now. But you must remember that with our 
escape, their plan might possibly change. Whatever it is, not only 
Kirika, but you are also an important key point to their success. So 
don&#39;t do anything sloppy. If luck is within me, I may meet you again. 
There, I can help you rescue Kirika back. If I had not yet be seen 
during your recovery days, you&#39;d better not wait for me any longer. 
Therefore, you will have to act alone.

Another advice, that you must stay in the town for no longer than three 
days. Soldats is definitely chasing and searching for you, even now. The 
town however, is not pretty far from the place you once escaped from. 
Don&#39;t look suspicious or attract any attention. Play smart. Study the 
map. Don&#39;t underestimate. Use the gun wisely. Furthermore, I wish you 
and Kirika the best luck for everything.

Chloe.

Mireille stared blankly at the letter as soon as she finished reading 
it. She was worried, really worried about Kirika and also, Chloe. The 
purple haired girl had helped her so much it could not be listed down by 
words alone. She provided her with almost everything she needed right 
now &#150; money, information, a weapon. But the girl&#39;s life had remained 
questionable and unknown for now. No one knew whether the girl survived 
from the last battle or not. For the first time in her life - after her 
unexpected rescue - Mireille really hoped to see Chloe again, alive.

Sighing, the Corsican girl folded the letter and slipped it inside the 
same envelope it was brought out from. As she tugged the money inside as 
well, the Corsican girl noticed one paper left alone on the bed&#39;s 
surface. She opened it up, and found a kind of map drawing. At the 
bottom of the paper she read: &quot;Map.&quot; Mireille smiled slightly. Chloe had 
really thought about everything; the map could help her made some more 
accurate steps ahead. She darted her eyes all over the map, noticing the 
significant symbol in the map. She found the place Kirika was kept in 
for an instance - a big room, judging from the picture&#39;s size. A while 
after, the blonde figured out the location she was trapped in yesterday. 
Those places were marked purposely with a blue cross.

She leaned to sit, and studied the paper a little bit more. She counted 
the total of the rooms, predicted the best way to come in and out, and 
so on. Sunk deep down by the curiosity of her next battlefield, Mireille 
forgot the pleading sound of her stomach of hunger, the dryness in her 
throat, the stiffness on her left arm, and the fever she was suffering. 
For an instance, she forgot everything unnecessary beside the map. Time 
passed quickly with Mireille scanning the map almost the whole day, 
planning a reliable plan, questioning the possibility of guards, and 
other things necessary. Her gaze remained steady, her mind thought 
simultaneously.

It was not until the moon had shown that her inner need screamed in and 
the Corsican girl finally realized how hungry she was. Taking the gun, 
the map, and the envelope with her, Mireille stood up from her bed 
slowly, then left her room and seek for goods and medicine.

Just by walking down and wandering for the first ten minutes, Mireille 
felt an awkward feeling due to people&#39;s curious staring at her. The 
Corsican girl, confused and perplexed as she was, finally came to notice 
the source of all the staring. She had not bathed, she smelled, and her 
clothes were ripped and torn out everywhere, leaving visible holes on 
the garment. Not to mention that she was dirty enough to make people 
avoid her as well.

Realizing her physical condition, Mireille rushed towards the shop that 
sold clothes and all, bought a thick jacket, a red shirt, and trousers 
she laid her eyes first on, ignoring the &#39;how-can-she-have-money&#39; stare 
from the shopkeeper, and ran back to her inn. Once she stepped inside 
the room, Mireille closed the door and sighed. All of the sudden, a 
stinging shot of dizziness attacked her. With that, the Corsican girl 
came back to notice her fever.

The blonde&#39;s body fall sit on the floor weakly; her weight barely 
strengthen by her legs. Sitting on the floor, Mireille found her body 
weary without energy. She let go her grab of the clothes&#39; bag. 
Apparently, the fever had grown worse enough to make her once again 
suffering from her health. Despite all the sweat pouring down from her 
forehead and her body, Mireille hobbered to bed and fall asleep right 
after the first touch of the bed on her chin.

An hour of rest, then the Corsican girl finally got better of her fever 
effect and fit enough to walk on and took a bath. Refreshed by the bath 
- quite healthy and new - Mireille wore her new clothes and jacket, then 
once again dawdled outside the inn and bought all she needed to feed her 
strength and her health. Her new appearance had proved to be effective ; 
no one looked at her in that devastating way such as before. She ate in 
silence at a small restaurant near the inn, trying not to attract any 
attention at all. Finished with her supper, the Corsican girl went to 
the one and only clinic in the small town, asking for medicine, then 
went off to her inn again after her left arm was bandaged neatly &#150; which 
was not by her own accord but rather by the nurse&#39;s worried and caring 
personality. Heading to her room, Mireille stole some glance secretly at 
the inn&#39;s bar just in case she would see Chloe&#39;s sign of existence 
somewhere in town.

Therefore, the sight of no one resembling the purple haired girl caused 
the blonde sighed once more.

-----------------------

The next day, at exactly three o&#39; clock in the morning, Mireille woke up 
impassively after her dreamless sleep. The fact that she managed to get 
up this early had somehow proved a great recovery progress of her 
fatigue and fever. And regardless of her left arm, she felt much better 
than yesterday. The Corsican girl grabbed her gun inside the pocket, and 
walked on to the bathroom. She brushed her teeth, washed her face, and 
got out from the bathroom as quick as she got in. Mireille put on her 
jacket, slipped the white envelope to her pocket, and after a while 
scanning her room silently, left the room inaudibly.

Outside, the sun had barely shown up. The sky was lightly dark, the 
remaining of last night. The flickering sound of leaves by the wind, the 
vague sound of nocturne&#39;s activity, and her own heavy breath were the 
only things that adorned the silent town. Mireille marched to the same 
direction she came from the day before yesterday ; she was ready to head 
off.

Noticing how she was soon enough going to be a fugitive, Mireille felt 
it would be best to get out of town as fast as she could. Apart from 
that too, the blonde had begun to feel the unease, dangerous stares 
again as if she was being watched by somebody. If Soldats played all 
sneaky and smart, she would do better, and quicker. She had prepared a 
plan - not entirely a reliable plan, but a worth one to try. She was 
going to go back exactly at the cellar she once trapped in. She would 
investigate the boxes, and hopefully, found what she needed &#150; 
ammunitions. She only had one simple gun, after all. Mireille recalled 
her first day there back then &#150; she smelled something familiar, some 
kind of cigarettes and tobacco. It was not quite enough to judge that 
ammunition was the one inside those boxes, but at least she must try.

As her sweat began to pour down, Mireille saw the bridge, and not much 
farther, the old village. She crossed the bridge cautiously while 
narrowing her eyes; searching for people she may encounter. To her 
relief, she found none of them. With luck, she would go through the old 
village by causing no harm, neither received some.

Ten feet ahead from where she was before, Mireille had walked down the 
village with great vigilance ; pointed her gun right away she heard some 
noise which often just animals&#39; moaning, or turned her back abruptly 
just to make sure no one was following her. Fifteen minutes later, she 
finally caught sight of the green field &#150; the back of the storeroom. She 
ran quickly there without causing any noisy sound, and stopped her step 
right in front of a hole which was half down her size.

So far everything&#39;s good.

Mireille assumed that Soldats would likely make some action towards the 
hole - as it was obviously the only place one could manage to escape 
from - but the hole was really there; it was neither closed nor 
destroyed. It might be a trap, but she did not care. Praying that no one 
would be inside the storeroom - or had it been one hoping that they 
would not notice her in - Mireille lowered her body and slipped between 
the holes, pushed the boxes aside, and peered cautiously into the dark, 
stuffy room. The same piles of boxes still tugged roughly; the same old 
machines sternly stood in an ignorant way. The Corsican girl prepared 
her gun, and braved herself to walk deeper in. She dawdled to her 
chair&#39;s direction first, hided between the boxes, and stopped to analyze 
the room. As her eyes wandered, she felt no one was speaking, nor 
walking. The room seemed to be pretty safe, and abandoned. Despite all 
that, the blonde kept silence and hovered for the next minutes just in 
case somebody would really be there.

A while after, now pretty sure that no one was there beside herself, the 
Corsican girl stepped lightly to open the box nearest to her. She ripped 
the seal softly but strongly, and peered inside the box contain. Had the 
Goddess of Luck existed, Mireille sure was bestowed by her for 
especially today; the box contain had greatly pleased her. Not only she 
found the ammo for her gun, she found a lot old dynamites as well. Not 
even wondering why such ammunitions were stored down here, Mireille 
checked the condition of it and smiled in relief ; those would still 
function properly. She jerked in anything she needed inside her jacket, 
her pockets, and her boots. With those dynamites and all, as well as two 
boxes of matchstick she brought from the inn, Mireille was ready for the 
coming fight.

She had studied the map thoroughly. The Soldats base &#150; tough Mireille 
was not particularly sure this was the base - was not that big and hard 
to strike despite the member&#39;s quantity strength. Based on the map, the 
storeroom she was currently in was not included at the base part ; it 
could be said just as a decoration. The base was located right at the 
center, surrounded by three more other bug building just like the 
storeroom, each right on the north, south, west, and east side. Those 
four building were made to block the base center in sight. The base was 
located underground, which was also the place Kirika might be kept in.

To reach the underground place, all Mireille had to do was just walk out 
from this storeroom to the base center, and took the stairs down. But 
stealthy as the base were, there was no joking the stairs that lead to 
the underground would strictly guarded, even at this early in the 
morning. She could throw up the dynamites all over the places to attract 
the guard&#39;s attention, but it might as well attract the other&#39;s 
attention at her, which obviously must be avoided. Sighing, Mireille 
decided to just peer at the condition outside first as she walked to the 
exit door. She opened it up slightly, and looked carefully. As expected, 
around twenty guards were patrolling around the stairs. Despite how 
silly looking the guards were &#150; guarding a stairs &#150; those guard really 
worked their job and watched the surroundings severely. Mireille thought 
hard, but found no clue whatsoever. Not that she had no guts to just 
strike the guards, but the sounds of gun would make unnecessary noise 
which at the worst case would bring up more and more members to kill.

A flash of movement rustled by. Instinctively, Mireille&#39;s body tensed 
and she instantly turned her back, pointing her gun. Now that she had 
spun on her heels, the Corsican girl stared in shock as her gun grasped 
tightly on her hands, and her mouth opened up mutely in surprise. She 
had no idea what to say. Fortunately the person said calmly first, &quot;Nice 
to see you.&quot;

&quot;..Same here,&quot; Mireille said smiling after a while stood silent, 
seriously shock. Lowering her gun, the blonde added, &quot;Chloe.&quot;

Unexpectedly, despite the perilous situation they were in, and despite 
how unfriendly they were before, the two assassins smiled warmly to each 
other.

&quot;For the first time in my life, I&#39;m really happy to see you, Chloe.&quot; 
Mireille said, looking at the younger girl. &quot;You finished them off, eh?&quot;

&quot;..Yeah.&quot; Chloe replied calmly.

&quot;Any fatal injuries?&quot;

&quot;..No.&quot; the younger girl answered. &quot;You&#39;ve read the letter?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Mireille said in a low voice, &quot;Then you are here to help me, 
right?&quot;

Chloe raised her eyebrows in amusing way and answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;

With Chloe joining her party, Mireille set up a new tactic. The two of 
them would ambush those guards, considering that knives would not cause 
unneeded noises. Onwards with the plan, the new pair of assassins burst 
out of their hiding place the next moment; showed off their abilities, 
running all over the places quickly and confusingly while also attacking 
at the same time. Even the guards &#150; aided by their guns - were not 
allowed to shoot randomly, let alone have a chance. Chloe did the fight 
mostly; her knives flew silently into man&#39;s throat, or stabbed deeply in 
the guard&#39;s heart &#150; all of those actions done in an outstanding speed. 
Meanwhile, Mireille was the one in charge to avoid anyone report the 
invasion. She ran to the stairs in an amazing speed, and blocked the 
guards&#39; way as silent as she could - either punching or kicking. It all 
proved to work well. It was practically new for them to work together, 
but somehow they were already shared bonds and above all that, pretty 
strong with their unusual combination. All the guards on the surface had 
laid their head silently on the ground by ten minutes.

A bit surprised with their easy victory, Mireille stood at her place and 
looked bluntly at the scattered men&#39;s body.

&quot;We must hurry.&quot; said Chloe.

With a small nod as an answer, Mireille and Chloe walked down the stairs 
- to the very main base of Soldats. As soon as their feet left the 
stairs and stood on a corridor, around thirty men were already rushing 
to their way, all roaring animatedly. Noticing the danger, Mireille shot 
as quick as she could while rolling to the back of one wall to hide 
herself. The younger girl, already launching her knives from all 
direction was already nowhere in sight; she had visibly disappeared. The 
sounds of shooting guns, slashing knives, painful and brutal screaming 
hung in the air for some minutes. In an unexpected fast motion, the 
fight had lasted with victory on the blonde&#39;s side.

Breathing, Mireille focused her mind to relax and started to keep on. 
Chloe was already running far ahead before gesturing the blonde to 
quicken their pace. Their footsteps clattered down the brilliant 
corridors&#39; tiles as they rushed into the destination. The base was 
surprisingly huge, with uncountable long corridors all around which made 
it looked like a maze rather than a base. Moreover, the shining clean 
gold tiles were so splendid it made Mireille wanted to laugh as her face 
was visible on it, as if looking at a real mirror. She had expected to 
see the formal, sorrowful base in here, however.

They passed through many rooms, some of which were obviously abandoned. 
Sometimes they got to have a battle inside a tiny room - striking, 
dodging the annoying guards wildly in such little space they had. They 
kept winning and winning, but after all that, Kirika&#39;s room was still 
further deep ahead; they might encounters lots of other armed- groups 
like before. The thought become real as after a long minutes jogging 
along another corridor, the pair met some tough looking men with their 
huge muscles. This time, the two once again became formidable ; their 
moves seemed to be well-organized, their thoughts linked, and their 
purpose had become one. Chloe launched her knives; Mireille shot her gun 
or sometimes lit the dynamites and threw it far away carefully.

With those unique coordination and cooperation, they passed through one 
corridor, one level, another one, other, then one more and more. As they 
were automatically used to each other pair, their action became more and 
more deathly to the enemies; if some groups of men showed up, they would 
now finish them in seconds. But still they must pay attention seriously 
to the number of guards that kept coming along and along - it was really 
frustrating and tiring. They fought hard, sometimes stopped to keep 
their breath calm, then defended themselves at first before striking 
back. Sometimes, a group with more trained skills blocked the way, and 
Mireille and Chloe got to spend their time longer and tougher, as well 
as received some injuries. But despite how weary they might have become 
and all injuries they had, the pair struggle and fought incredibly well 
today. Not even daring to rest for a minute, Mireille and Chloe fought 
as hard and as fast as they could. They had decided not to waste any 
more time to save the brunette.

Mireille shot - she hoped - the last standing guard on her left, then 
took a deep inhale. Chloe, finished already with her fight, were now

paper on her hand, gazed at it for a while, then nod slightly. &quot;Straight 
ahead.&quot; The pair, exhausted but determined, had passed through all size 
of rooms, killed many guards blocking the way, run through all kinds of 
stairs and finally arrived at the deepest part of the base. Based on the 
map, this corridor did not have a stair and probably the last level of 
the base. Therefore, there was only one room left. Without no further 
talk, the pair dashed their feet to the destination room where Kirika 
was possibly trapped in. This moment might be the last step needed to 
rescue the Japanese girl back safe and sound.

They would only save their strength for the last battle, considering 
Naomi would be the one guarding Kirika as the new pair had not seen the 
female Soldats since they invaded. As soon as they took care of Naomi, 
they would bring Kirika back up, fast. And all would be over, and 
everything turned normal as what it was supposed to be.

with her gun pointed firmly - at the pair.</pre>
