<a href="../noir/redblack-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The Hourglass


Kirika lay on her stomach; the tatami mats a comfy padding beneath her 
prostrate slender body. A yellow sundress was draped over that willowy 
frame, and what of her legs it left naked idly treaded the air above her 
bottom, bare feet swaying gently as though subject to the whims of a 
breeze. The dress was thin, light and airy, hanging from her slight 
figure by slim shoulder straps running over her bare back and upper 
chest; summer wear not for the cold weather outside. But Kirika was 
cosy. Inside the living room it was pleasantly toasty, the heating 
turned up to mimic the absent warm summer afternoon.

Kirika&#39;s crossed arms were a cushion beneath her chin, as well as a prop 
to keep her head upright and her eyes comfortably in line with the 
television a distance away in the kitchen. A bread crust wagged to and 
fro and gradually shortened where it dangled from her working mouth, the 
sodden end between her lips absently nibbled on above a plate of crumbs 
that was all else that represented a ham and cheese sandwich lunch after 
the girl had sated her rumbling tummy.

There was nothing particularly captivating on television, but it was 
interesting nonetheless to Kirika. She hadn&#39;t seen any Japanese programs 
in a very long time; not since she&#39;d last been in Japan; but they were 
about the same as French shows in how peculiar they were. People were 
pictured doing all sorts of activities; a lot Kirika didn&#39;t understand; 
things and events were promoted and publicised; again many completely 
new and baffling; and pantomimes of lives were played out as though 
real; and the viewer with a spyglass into their intimacies. Television 
was oft times educational but mostly entertainment, Mireille had said. 
Kirika supposed it was intriguing seeing how other people lived even if 
they were lives conceived by someone&#39;s imagination, however that idea 
that they were fictitious was too near a match for what her life had 
once been. Before coming to her former home Kirika couldn&#39;t watch those 
peeping programs for too long before ill memories started to stir up 
that she&#39;d rather leave still. It was all right now, though. She was 
reminded of how her past life shared similarities to the scripting of 
television dramas when she viewed them, but the reminder brought nothing 
else with it to create an upsetting union anymore. No harboured bad 
feelings, no gnawing longings. Kirika was at peace with that time, that 
life, and free from its haunting.

Moreover, she was free to enjoy television further. Kirika didn&#39;t derive 
that much enjoyment from it really, but her favourite programs were the 
variety where people were depicted in romantic situations. She liked 
seeing what sorts of things they did to express their feelings for one 
another. However, there was frequently some obstacle to plague the 
couple&#39;s love, usually someone else who too had affection for one of the 
pair. Those kinds of developments scared Kirika and made her wonder if 
she and Mireille might maybe face comparable problems. There seemed to 
be so *many* potential hurdles for love. And Mireille was acquainted 
with a lot of people, and probably more that Kirika didn&#39;t even know 
about. What if she liked one of them? What if she liked one of them more 
than her? But then Kirika was sure she was the closest person to 
Mireille; the blonde did seem to spend nearly all of her moments with 
her. They were partners too, after all. Yet in those shows nothing 
appeared to totally rule out the chance of a third party entering the 
scene, vying for the attention of the woman or man with the hopes of 
stealing their heart away from their beloved. Kirika had learned to 
change the channel quickly when she disliked what she saw. Besides, she 
still hadn&#39;t discovered any programs concerning loving partnerships 
between women, and that was what she really had an interest in. Romance 
involving women and men were okay, but until Kirika found what she was 
really looking for they would never hold her curiosity for long.

Sometimes Kirika saw the news broadcast. Mireille liked to watch it 
every now and then, so Kirika watched it with her, mimicking the woman&#39;s 
interest. The girl didn&#39;t actually have a care for what was happening 
around the rest of the world, but solely sought to share the time and 
activity with her adored partner. Kirika&#39;s whole world of interest took 
up only the modest space of the living room--the room where Mireille and 
herself resided. Wherever Mireille went Kirika&#39;s entire world traveled 
with her.

Content humming shaped a peaceful song in Kirika&#39;s world, underscoring 
the laid-back ambiance of it in beautiful tones. The hummed melody was 
heard above anything the television quietly droned, and it was that 
which Kirika really listened to. Serenity played in Kirika&#39;s heart in 
harmony with the dulcet voice, a singer who could always sooth her soul 
with her ease. Hearing--knowing--that Mireille was happy inspired Kirika 
to feel the same, to be absorbed in her love&#39;s mood. She didn&#39;t know the 
song, but the blonde&#39;s humming was almost a lullaby for Kirika, charming 
her eyelids to droop lazily and her body to wilt, and hushing the 
thoughts in her head. Kirika dreamt of curling up beside Mireille while 
she hummed, slumbering under the blue gaze and silky voice of the one 
she loved.

Kirika&#39;s eyes, struggling against drowsiness, turned to Mireille who 
seemed oblivious to the seducing her contentment weaved. She sat to the 
left of Kirika near another side of the kotetsu, bent forwards at the 
waist and her knees drawn up close to her chest, focused on her bare 
feet that were angled upwards for the benefit of her vision. With a 
little bottle in one hand and its lid equipped with a tiny brush 
underneath in the other, she was busy painstakingly painting each of her 
toenails a shade of lavender. White cotton balls were stuffed between 
her toes; Kirika had seen Mireille do the like before, but she still 
hadn&#39;t figured out why it was necessary. They forced the blonde&#39;s toes 
to separate and stay that way. Was it to make the nails easier to paint? 
Why didn&#39;t Mireille stick cotton balls between her fingers when she 
painted her fingernails? Kirika was reasonably sure colouring her nails 
was to make them prettier; another of Mireille&#39;s beautifying treatments. 
But that was all she was sure of. Mireille didn&#39;t need to paint her 
nails to become more beautiful. Kirika believed her beautiful just the 
way she came.

Mireille wore a dress like Kirika did, and it was lavender like the 
colour the woman was painting her toenails. Kirika didn&#39;t know if there 
was any deliberate connection, but it made a good match. Mireille&#39;s 
dress was longer than Kirika&#39;s, coming midway down her shins, and 
covered her more completely with sleeves a little past her wrists and 
only a shallow scoop neck letting her collar bones show. It was rather 
form fitting however, conforming to the curves and swells of Mireille&#39;s 
figure like a satin glove did to a hand. Now that Kirika reflected on 
it, most of Mireille&#39;s clothing enjoyed having a close embrace over her 
body, smoothing over flaring hips and rising chest. Yet this dress, 
being in one piece from top to bottom, seemed to cling to and accentuate 
her physique more than usual. Kirika liked looking at her.

At Mireille&#39;s edge of the kotetsu sat a few spare cotton balls the 
blonde hadn&#39;t found a use for yet, and an empty plate and juice glass 
that had once borne her sandwich and water respectively. Kirika&#39;s empty 
glass was on the floor nearby like her lunch plate, although an orange 
pool collected at its bottom told of her different choice of beverage to 
her partner. Mireille had seen to mealtime with some of the groceries 
she and Kirika had fetched three days ago. Three days of respite. Three 
days of mundane mornings, average afternoons, and everyday evenings.

It hadn&#39;t been boring. Maybe some people would have been fed up with 
nothing to do for three whole days aside from for what could be pursued 
as entertainment in the house&#39;s confines, but Kirika was not one of 
those people. There was plenty for her to absorb her time with here. 
Moreover, they were pleasant pursuits. Lounging in bed, on the floor, by 
a window--anywhere she found herself, with dreams and musings drifting 
through her head to steal away all sense of time; watching curious 
television programs; cooking with her partner and together eating the 
products of their labours; the nights spent in utter delight reclining 
beside the blonde woman in bed; and most of all admiring Mireille with 
an unobtrusive joy. Simple pleasures belonging to a simple life. For 
someone whose life had never been simple, it was bliss. It was peace.

Mireille wasn&#39;t one of those people who got anxious while caged by four 
walls either. She was perfectly at ease, using the time as though they 
were back home again after their return from the Manor; much like Kirika 
was, the girl herself realised. Mireille was always doing something; if 
she was not drinking tea while attentive to her laptop&#39;s bright glow, 
then she was teasing Kirika with playful puzzlements that were amusing 
to her but eccentric to her dark-haired junior. She sometimes joined 
Kirika in viewing Japanese TV too, and also shared in being a bit 
nonplussed with it going by the looks on her face. Mireille didn&#39;t 
devote much time to watching unless the news was on following that 
initial sampling, but even then she favoured the screen of her laptop 
noticeably more than she did the screen of the television.

Kirika longed for the hours to never expire, for the minutes to stretch 
on and on forever and ever. For day to never fall into dusk. But naught 
save Kirika&#39;s love for Mireille lasted forever. Time took no reprieve 
and it gave none; trickling away second by second without end. Only one 
more dawn remained. One more day of quiet. Today was that day. Kirika 
tried to keep her thoughts apart from the looming reality, but too 
frequently they eluded her barricades in her more negligent moments. The 
black clouds amassing over her dawn. There were not many grains of sand 
left to run through the hourglass, and no means to shatter it.

While Kirika continued to treat her eyes and chew the last of her bread 
crust, Mireille delicately applied one finishing stroke of the brush to 
her right pinky toenail, completing the lavender set of ten. The woman&#39;s 
content smile turned fuller with fulfillment as she reviewed her 
titivating toil for a second, before she then started plucking the half 
a dozen squeezed cotton balls out from the recesses separating her toes. 
She tossed the used cotton balls heedlessly on the kotetsu without a 
look, too rapt in admiring the painted procession she had fashioned.

Kirika admired too, but from Mireille&#39;s toes all the way to the top of 
her flaxen head. Every part of the wonderful woman kept her enthralled.

When the sixth cotton ball had been discarded, Mireille lifted and 
scrunched her toes in the fresh freedom. Her gaze then rose and met 
Kirika&#39;s over the kotetsu with aplomb as though she had been conscious 
of the scrutiny the entire time, the skies in her eyes open and 
inviting, drawing the younger girl in.

&quot;Would you like to help me?&quot;

Kirika wasn&#39;t sure how she could help exactly, and her head sagged to 
the side under the weight of trying to figure it out. Regardless, she 
did want to assist her partner in any way she could.

The bewilderment must have showed, because Mireille grinned at Kirika 
with humour but also patience in her expression--indulgent of her less 
worldly companion as always. &quot;Blow on them. It will help them dry 
faster.&quot; Mireille pushed her feet forward across the tatami mats a 
little, the motion attracting Kirika&#39;s attention and feeding her 
understanding.

Kirika crawled over the floor by her elbows and on her stomach until 
Mireille&#39;s presented feet were framed in her vision. Still uncertain, 
and scared to blow too hard in case she ruined Mireille&#39;s work, Kirika 
simply looked at the blonde&#39;s feet for several moments. They were 
pretty, she thought. Dainty, but not so dainty they were too small for 
her. They looked so soft and supple despite the uncomfortably shaped 
shoes Mireille liked to cram them inside or strap on them even if she 
knew that she and Kirika would see a lot of running around because of 
skirmishes or being on assignment. Mireille did take care of every 
aspect of her body with her creams and lotions and things, and it 
apparently made the difference.

Still with merely her baited breathing on Mireille&#39;s feet, Kirika 
gingerly lowered her head close and choose to blow softly on the wet 
toenails, her cheeks puffing out and her lips puckering. They were shy 
exhalations, but enough to speed the paint to dry without harming it, 
she hoped. The wet lacquer&#39;s aroma was strong and almost heady this near 
and Kirika wrinkled her nose, but she ignored it for the most part.

&quot;That tickles,&quot; Mireille remarked. Kirika immediately stopped blowing 
and lifted her head, emitting a peep of worry while finding her 
partner&#39;s eyes, apology in her own. &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Mireille reassured, 
beaming down a calming smile upon Kirika prone before her. A hand came 
up, somewhat tentatively, slow in its indecision, but gently the blonde 
combed her fingers through Kirika&#39;s shaggy hair, pushing the girl&#39;s 
bangs back from her forehead. Mireille&#39;s right hand lingered on top of 
Kirika&#39;s head, and her thumb softly stroked the skin she had bared. It 
was the tranquility of the last three days at its sweetest, and Kirika 
basked in the unexpected attention and intimate sensations. Kirika 
maintained the gaze she shared with her partner, but the look in 
Mireille&#39;s eyes, though directed that way, didn&#39;t seem to meet hers. It 
seemed to go through Kirika, like the woman was looking at something 
else in her place, or something only she could see.

In a snap of eyelids it was over, and Mireille&#39;s eyes could see the real 
world once more. The blonde smiled a bit bigger and rubbed Kirika&#39;s 
head, tousling her hair some more, and then took her hand away to take 
the lid with brush from the paint bottle that she had put down on the 
floor. She tilted her left hand up at the wrist and fanned out her 
fingers, inspecting her nails for a second. In the next she was coating 
her fingernails with the lavender hue in vertical strokes away from her 
body, returning to dip the brush in the bottle every few thereafter.

Kirika went back to blowing, a touch disappointed that the special 
moment had passed. There would be others, but she wanted every one to go 
on for eternity. There was always that little disappointment afterwards 
when they fell short. Time stopped for nothing, not even love.

Kirika blew and blew until Mireille told her that was plenty, and then 
the girl laid her head on top of her folded hands once again and stared 
up at her beloved while each fingernail was painted. It didn&#39;t take too 
long with Mireille&#39;s experience at doing such aesthetic endeavours.

Mireille screwed the lid on the bottle securely and placed it on the 
kotetsu, and then she leaned forward, balancing her arms on her raised 
knees and dangling her hands in front of Kirika&#39;s face. &quot;Now blow,&quot; she 
instructed blithely, giving Kirika a wink.

Kirika sat up on her elbows and did as she was asked in earnest, keen to 
please and unwilling to disappoint. Mireille grinned, amused at Kirika&#39;s 
diligence. &quot;Maybe I can do your nails some time,&quot; she proposed impishly.

Kirika didn&#39;t know how to take that. Blanching thoughts of the lots of 
times she had been taken clothes shopping and coaxed into dressing up in 
different outfits and directed to stand in as many different positions 
entered her mind. She supposed it would be interesting and Mireille 
would have fun... and it was only her nails... but then how many colours 
of polish did the woman have? Kirika could imagine Mireille trying them 
all out on her one after the other. In one session. Until all the shades 
were exhausted... at least until she bought more. Fashion was as serious 
for Mireille as being an assassin was.

Mireille&#39;s limp hands suddenly came to life and the blonde tweaked 
Kirika&#39;s nose between the knuckles of her first two fingers of her right 
hand. &quot;All done!&quot; She winked again. &quot;Thank you!&quot;

Kirika smiled, happy to have been useful. Useful for something unrelated 
to the grisly art she had been intended for. Yet most of all, to have 
been useful to Mireille.

Mireille leaned back and admired her nails some more; at range 
straightening her arms out, and up close with her hands near to her 
face. Kirika watched, pleased that Mireille was pleased, and that she&#39;d 
had a role in it, if minor.

Mireille&#39;s left hand stayed at her eye level, its fingernails still 
being appreciated, but meanwhile her right stole under the kotetsu. When 
the latter reappeared, it bore something Kirika had not wanted to see in 
Mireille&#39;s grasp until tomorrow--if not ever again.

Mireille tapped her index finger on the trigger guard of her Walther P99 
as she held it aloft, barrel aimed at the ceiling. The pretense of 
admiring her nails was dropped, as was her left hand, and the assassin 
looked Kirika in the eye. A flash of uncertainty streaked across 
Mireille&#39;s visage and for a second her gaze fled Kirika&#39;s. But Mireille 
was never uncertain and never afraid; or seldom showed either frailty at 
any rate. The slippage was redressed almost instantly; the mask 
straightened back into seamless place.

The tapping on the pistol stopped. &quot;Let&#39;s get it done,&quot; Mireille said 
simply. She put on a supportive face, her smile straining to hold.

Kirika bowed her head and lowered her gaze; the best nod of 
acknowledgement she could give. She glanced under the kotetsu where her 
own weapon still remained in hibernation, yet close by should it need to 
be abruptly awakened. Kirika had tried to ignore it and Mireille&#39;s 
weapon, but they had been constant companions to each young woman 
throughout the days and nights of peace. Constant companions, and 
constant reminders of the times of war on the horizon.

Kirika slowly reached under the table and retrieved her dormant sidearm. 
As more of the final grains of sand filtered through the hourglass, the 
more substance the illusion shed. A flake of normality peeled away with 
each grain lost, the illusion&#39;s cohesion shaking loose in the final day, 
the final hours. Not once in three days was the reason that Kirika and 
Mireille were in Japan brought up. Not once since the first night were 
Jacque&#39;s documents touched. Not once since the first morning was there 
an indication of anything terrible ahead beyond the guns the pair always 
carried with them. The guns, the only sign, had ultimately been the 
downfall of the innocence. Even a single sign was too many.

Kirika reluctantly sat up in front of the kotetsu and arranged her legs 
into a kneeling position. She laid her Beretta M1934 on the small table 
and then placed her hands on her lap. Her hands clenched her thighs 
while she stared at the weapon.

&quot;I&#39;ll get the cleaning equipment,&quot; Mireille said quietly before standing 
up, pistol still in hand, and disappeared into the kitchen and up the 
stairs. Kirika could feel her depart, but her eyes were affixed to the 
pistol that was left behind.

Unthinkingly--instinctively--Kirika&#39;s hands left her thighs and went for 
the gun. Her gun. She hadn&#39;t owned it for long, but it was identical to 
its predecessor. A program ran in her head, a series of instructions she 
mechanically followed with an otherwise blank mind. Reflexes took over 
her limbs, intuition powering every movement.

Kirika pushed the magazine catch of her gun to the rear and popped out 
the clip, placing it on the table. In a quick motion she pulled back the 
slider and then let it snap back into place, and a bullet was ejected 
out of the chamber and into the air. The assassin snatched it before it 
hit the table, and then sat it on its end beside the magazine.

Kirika turned the safety backwards and drew the slider back once again, 
but this time locked it in position with the safety lever. The barrel 
exposed, Kirika pushed it from the front and unseated it from the frame, 
before effortlessly lifting the entire metal tubing out of the pistol. 
Precisely she laid the detached barrel horizontally on the kotetsu above 
the clip and solitary live round.

Kirika turned the safety lever down, unlocking the slider, and then 
pushed the latter forward until it slid completely free. She added that 
part to the growing collection on the table.

She tugged the recoil spring out from the front of what remained of the 
gun and removed it from the guide it coiled around, lying both below the 
slider and barrel.

Finally she twisted the safety lever loose and set that down; followed 
after by what was only a shell of a gun now--the handle more or 
less--alongside the other dissembled parts. The Beretta had been 
dismantled in less than fifteen seconds, perhaps as few as ten. Kirika 
had never actually timed herself, but the gun was in pieces before her 
conscious mind caught up to the fact. She could have broken it down with 
her eyes closed. And put it back together again just as fast.

Mireille wasn&#39;t long in returning. She sat herself down flanking Kirika, 
near, at the kotetsu on the girl&#39;s right. It was a small gesture, but it 
didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Kirika. Mireille could have elected to sit 
opposite her, the closest table edge coming from the kitchen and one 
that would have offered more room for her to take apart her firearm. Yet 
she hadn&#39;t. A small gesture... but it meant something to Kirika.

Mireille placed her Walther P99 in front of her and a box containing an 
aerosol can of compressed air, another can of lubricant, cleaning 
solvent, a couple of cloths and piles of patches, two cleaning rods, and 
a pair of bore brushes corresponding to the calibre of each woman&#39;s 
pistol in the middle on the table. The compressed air was a more 
delicate yet still thorough method for cleaning the pistols&#39; inner 
workings. It would clear out any dust and grime that had accumulated 
through service and in the aftermath of cleaning in strong, concentrated 
blasts of air. It even had a fairly lengthy tube-like nozzle for 
convenience. Cloths still had their place however, and were used for 
polishing the exteriors of the weapons&#39; frames. The lubricant was for 
limiting the friction of the working parts and preventing the 
solidification of firing residue, the bore brush for cleaning the 
barrels, the small square patches--endowed with a woven side and a 
fibrous side--along with the solvent for cleaning everything else 
internal that the air had failed to dislodge, and the cleaning rod to 
squeeze the equipment into those internals. It was quite an involved 
undertaking, but repeated practice had seen it become a methodical and 
rapid ritual for Kirika and Mireille, much like the breaking down of 
their weapons beforehand.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to find a secluded location to squeeze off a few rounds,&quot; 
Mireille commented as she pulled the ammunition clip from her pistol and 
put it on the kotetsu. &quot;I&#39;m not confident that the back garden is a 
sufficient width for long range practice.&quot; She yanked back the slider 
and then let it slam forward into its rest position while angling the 
gun toward the table, ensuring the bullet that flew out made its landing 
there. The 9mm Parabellum round bounced several times and rolled along 
the table, but before it could drop off the edge and onto the floor 
Mireille cupped it with her hand. &quot;And there&#39;s the chance one of the 
nosy neighbours might hear the shots, even with silencers.&quot; She sat the 
lone bullet with its peers in the magazine. &quot;They might even be nosy 
enough to take a peek over the fence. I don&#39;t like having to go outside 
before it&#39;s time, but....&quot;

Kirika stretched forward over the table to grab the can of compressed 
air and then picked up the slider of her dismantled Beretta M1934. &quot;I 
know a place,&quot; she said softly, spraying a burst of air along the length 
of the metal fixture&#39;s insides.

******

Kirika traipsed through the thick, lush carpet; deeply green and 
nourished though never tended to her knowledge. Dew still clung to the 
soft blades that rose tall enough in their neglect to tickle her ankles, 
wetting the girl&#39;s sandaled feet that had to lift a little higher than 
the grasses&#39; peak to get by. The wind finished what the damp started, 
chilling each foot an extra degree throughout their time hovering over 
the grasses&#39; shag. It was strong here, its howl drowning out any other 
sound, even those from the street where the Yuumura house stood left not 
far back.

But civilisation felt miles vanished in the dense verdancy. Wild bamboo 
interweaved to form a virtually unbroken screen to hold suburbia at bay, 
and their mingling grew friendlier the further Kirika and Mireille went 
on. It was a veritable hidden meadow in an otherwise urban sprawl. 
Kirika supposed it could have been thought of as peaceful and quaint, 
but sadly more sinister connotations had been laid within her when she 
had first discovered it. The secret aspect of the meadow would always 
remain its most distinguishing tone, for secrets had been revealed 
inside its bamboo shelter.

It was a dreamscape to Kirika, another memory drawn out from her mind 
and inserted into reality. She had killed here. She had killed here 
among the bamboo and grass for the first time; *she* had, the girl who 
had opened her eyes to over a decade spent and the memory of it 
gone--Kirika Yuumura. And she had killed with natural instinct and fatal 
precision, without thought given to extinguishing the lives before the 
deed was done. It was here that Kirika had recognised the myth that had 
been her normal life, and saw the blood and sin that stained her hands.

The nostalgia had returned, but nothing darker clung to it. If 
sentiments of sorrow or longing converged, they lacked the potency to 
threaten Kirika&#39;s heart. As Mireille had said, the past had past, and 
nothing would change it. That was fine. The past had paved the path to 
the present, and Kirika didn&#39;t yearn for that past changed anymore. It 
wasn&#39;t perfect, but Kirika had her happiness and was grateful for it. If 
nothing else ever bettered, if she never reached the horizon she saw, 
she would at least have that. Kirika would at least have her. She was 
the centre of everything. She *was* everything.

The girl glanced back at the radiant beauty that tailed her, she whom 
Kirika clutched on to in the black world&#39;s darkness, the light in the 
shadow personified; the angel in the sinners&#39; midst. As long as Kirika 
had Mireille and her love everything would be all right. And there would 
still always be hope for that better tomorrow, always, every moment she 
gazed into the dreamy blue of Mireille&#39;s eyes.

&quot;How much further is it?&quot; Mireille said as though sensing Kirika&#39;s look, 
her voice clearly fighting to keep the gripe out of it but tinged with 
complaint nonetheless. She was hunched slightly and her head was down, 
her hair falling past her cheeks, and she shot a sharp breathe 
cantankerously past her teeth while she looked where her feet were 
plodding through the thick and soggy grass. Those feet were clad only in 
sandals like Kirika&#39;s feet, and were just as ineffective at withstanding 
the wet and cold. Kirika hoped the painstaking adorning Mireille had 
given her toenails less than an hour ago weren&#39;t being spoilt in the 
dew.

The blonde&#39;s left fist held the bunched bottom of her dress taut out to 
the side and raised up near knee level, allowing her legs to move with a 
little more freedom. Kirika could see that the ball of cloth in her hand 
and the slanted hem across her shins were dark from the soaking the 
caressing blades of grass had given them before the woman had decided to 
let just her feet and ankles suffer the dousing. Kirika began to worry 
and doubt herself in choosing to come to the seclusion here. She and 
Mireille wore coats over their thin dresses, but it was short-term 
warmth and wouldn&#39;t fend off the unpleasant conditions at length. Kirika 
didn&#39;t picture them remaining more than fifteen or so minutes anyway, 
and neither did Mireille she expected, or else the woman would have 
insisted her younger partner prepare herself better for the cold weather 
before taking one step out the door.

Kirika and Mireille would stay just long enough behind the bamboo 
curtain to expend a clip or two to test their firearms and their own 
accuracy. Their accuracy was practically always rated one hundred 
percent, however. Kirika only remembered one occasion when Mireille&#39;s 
aim was off, horribly off; when they were to confront Intoccabile in 
Sicily, an old and feared childhood friend of the blonde&#39;s. Moreover, it 
was the only time Kirika had seen the normally cool, calm and collected 
Mireille scared of anybody--*really* scared. It had been interesting for 
Kirika to witness and frightening all at once. The experience had caused 
novel and potent emotions and desires in Kirika. Mireille, once so 
strong, had appeared so vulnerable--fallible after all. Kirika had 
wanted to shelter her. She had wanted to protect her; watch over her. 
From then on, Kirika always did.

That incentive to protect had no limits, covering the more trivial 
hazards as well as the deadlier ones common to their line of work. 
Regardless of how little time they might spend here, Kirika wished 
Mireille would button her coat. Mireille had told her to zip up. If 
Kirika had to do it, why didn&#39;t Mireille? It was actually harder to 
defend Mireille from the minor threats than it was to guard her with a 
gun in hand. Usually Kirika was left to fret helplessly, assisting her 
love merely when it would be accepted and not deemed presumptuous, 
invading. Mireille had a liberty with her that Kirika didn&#39;t have with 
the older woman. It tied Kirika&#39;s already hesitant tongue and shied away 
her helping hands, and abandoned her heart to worry.

The grassy carpet took a sudden dip, and Kirika dallied at its summit 
for a moment. &quot;Not much further,&quot; she said quietly, her voice nearly 
whipped away by the wind.

Kirika negotiated the fairly steep slope more slowly and carefully than 
the last time she had, back then skidding down its span with a Soldats 
execution squad at her heels, their bullets whistling about her fleeing 
body and spurring her haste. It had ended in the clearing below, where 
the wind through the bamboo funneled a million shrieks into a single 
roar--the pursuit and their lives... Kirika&#39;s life then included.

When Kirika reached the bottom of the incline she turned back to see how 
Mireille was progressing. The woman navigated the slope even more slowly 
and carefully than Kirika had, her high-heeled sandals seeming to 
inhibit her step and unsteady her balance. She had pulled the hem of her 
dress higher up her legs now to compensate, her left knee almost 
showing, and her eyes were still weighing her footing.

After Mireille had inched a bit closer to the base of the hill she took 
a quick glance up at where Kirika waited and then seeing how near the 
girl was, held out a hand toward her. Before Kirika could ponder that 
hand however, all of sudden Mireille&#39;s right foot skidded over the wet 
grass and she pitched dangerously forward, as if on the verge of 
stumbling ungainly down the slope. Kirika&#39;s raw instincts and groomed 
reflexes took over from her indolent musings and timid protocol relating 
to the blonde and she simply reacted to the perilous predicament her 
love was in. Kirika grabbed Mireille&#39;s reaching hand in a firm clasp and 
braced herself, her arm becoming an unyielding support of muscles for 
her partner to lean against and use to regain equilibrium.

Once Mireille&#39;s footing had been found again, the woman looked up and 
rewarded Kirika a sheepish look but grateful smile with it before easing 
the rest of the way down the hill, holding her partner&#39;s hand as escort 
for every subsequent step.

&quot;Sorry....&quot; Kirika said mournfully when Mireille was safely on level 
ground. She let her hand become flaccid and drop from Mireille&#39;s, 
although she grieved for its departure. That said, she had felt unfit of 
the privilege. Her head hanged to the ground, and she looked down at her 
toes and Mireille&#39;s more ostentatious ones close by. They looked shiny 
all wet.

&quot;You&#39;re not at fault for my questionable grace,&quot; Mireille shrugged off 
while missing some of that spoken grace in her feigned frivolity, her 
antagonism discernibly subjugated for Kirika&#39;s welfare. &quot;Neither of us 
are dressed for it and you did just fine,&quot; she added after a moment of 
thought.

Kirika knew she was just being kind, and the last especially backfired 
from being a fortifying comfort. It engendered a lament in Kirika that 
she hadn&#39;t better informed Mireille about the terrain ahead. Mireille 
could have hurt herself, and surely she would have had an easier time of 
it getting to the clearing if Kirika had had the prudence. Perhaps it 
wasn&#39;t only Kirika&#39;s apprehension that impeded her capacity to tend to 
Mireille&#39;s wellbeing. She had a lot to learn. However, Kirika was in the 
company of the most capable person to teach her.

Kirika and Mireille were here now and nothing of their attire or 
condition could be improved this late. Putting it out of her mind as far 
as she could, which wasn&#39;t so far as to be completely forgotten since it 
pertained to Mireille, Kirika swung her doleful eyes from her and her 
love&#39;s waterlogged feet to the clearing&#39;s round expanse. There were more 
ghosts of her past here, maybe chiming in their wailing with the winds&#39;, 
but they weren&#39;t the same as those in the Yuumura house. The ghosts here 
belonged to people. They belonged to the dead.

The wind had muffled the gunshots, but the grass hadn&#39;t been able to 
hide the bodies. Or what Kirika had done. She wondered what had happened 
to the three corpses, each with a single slug buried in their chest that 
had robbed them of breath evermore. Was the clearing an old Kawasaki 
crime scene, the case of three mysterious murders in suburbia unsolved? 
Or had Soldats come to collect their dead after the fact and erased all 
trace of their passing? Did bullet casings mingle amid the lush blades 
of grass, or had each been meticulously found and removed with the 
carcasses? Soldats were known to clean up after themselves, and only 
they were privy to the truth of the aftermath.

It was strange to mourn for three Soldats lives--any three lives--when 
Kirika had taken so many and felt nothing before. However, Kirika felt 
remorse seed her heart. Yes, they had been the first for her. In 
self-defence, but killing was killing. Yet....

Kirika&#39;s dismal expression sank further into bleakness as her heart 
suddenly did. The nostalgia lingered still, but it wasn&#39;t that or the 
regret that had strengthened to drag her down. It was because she wasn&#39;t 
mourning the lives. She was mourning the loss of her own, the loss of 
her ignorance that had been her innocence. Not the lives she had ended 
in simple seconds, no. If her hands were not jet-black back then, they 
definitely were now. Along with her heart.

&lt;Sinner....&gt;

She was right.

&quot;Remote enough, or so it would seem for eyes outside,&quot; Mireille said, 
looking around the cordoned off clearing, her voice dashing aside the 
silken whisper in Kirika&#39;s mind like a flimsy cobweb and grounding the 
girl back in reality, turning her outside of her head as one would fold 
a jumper inside out. Mireille&#39;s hand went inside her flapping coat and 
out came her gun, then her other hand did the same at the opposite 
breast and the weapon&#39;s silencer was retrieved. She glanced sidelong at 
Kirika. If the woman sensed Kirika&#39;s gloomy mood, she pretended she 
didn&#39;t with that dispassion in her profile. Or maybe Mireille 
misguidedly alleged Kirika&#39;s mood was rooted wholly from her slip on the 
slope still and didn&#39;t want to bring it up again to fester her partner&#39;s 
disconcertion. In any case, Kirika&#39;s black heart wasn&#39;t something she 
would ever contemplate revealing to Mireille. Like her silent internal 
battle, there were some things the girl just couldn&#39;t let outside 
herself. For this one, she wondered if it was shame holding her back.

&quot;We&#39;re still in the neighbourhood, however,&quot; Mireille continued, her 
attention on her tools now as she screwed the silencer on the Walther 
P99&#39;s barrel&#39;s thread. She lifted the gun up near her head when she was 
ready, and looked at Kirika again. &quot;No point in taking the risk,&quot; she 
said.

&quot;Mm...&quot; Kirika droned distractedly. The silencers did affect a firearm&#39;s 
accuracy and range, which was why she and Mireille hardly ever carried 
out their target practice with the sound suppressers fitted. But for a 
sharpshooter like Mireille it mattered little unless she was exchanging 
fire at extreme distances beyond the specified scope of any pistol, and 
at those extents accuracy already would be grossly hindered by gravity&#39;s 
pull.

A silencer had never bothered Kirika&#39;s aim either. In some respects she 
liked it better, the crack of her sin subdued to a soft sullying, death 
in a whisper. As though it lessened the act&#39;s severity somehow, in the 
quiet. It didn&#39;t really, but it was a sinner&#39;s fantasy. Kirika fastened 
her silencer to her Beretta.

&quot;There&#39;s not much in the way of targets,&quot; Mireille said, walking deeper 
into the clearing while peering about the bamboo some more. She stopped 
and her arm with her gun swung up smoothly, yet rigid by the end, and 
she snapped a practically noiseless shot off. An upright branch on the 
far side of the blonde rocked back violently, suddenly sporting an 
unnatural round divot where flawless bamboo had been. It swayed back and 
forth, faster than its mates did, the wind nothing to do with the vigour 
of its movement. Mireille turned back, smirking with confidence. &quot;But 
we&#39;ll make do.&quot; The branch couldn&#39;t have been more than a couple of 
inches wide, if that.

Kirika was happy that Mireille decided the spot suitable. Not as happy 
as she had been in the living room tending to her partner&#39;s lacquered 
nails, though. Kirika had been useful again, but it was now the sort of 
useful she disliked.

Kirika walked to Mireille&#39;s flank, raising her pistol. She fired before 
she had reached the woman, hammering a second bullet nail into the 
bamboo and digging a deeper divot, sending the branch waving once more. 
The bamboo shaft above the hollow started to sag askew, splintering from 
the bottom. These targets couldn&#39;t withstand many rounds. Like flesh and 
blood people.

Every bamboo branch became a target, an untold number of people 
encircling Kirika and Mireille. They shot at will, emptying magazines 
and maiming branches without mercy or mistake. A little more of the 
illusion, of normality, slipped away in the hail of muted fire, in the 
drizzle of ejected casings that silently tumbled to join whatever old 
9mm and other calibre shells lay forgotten in the grass, if any. Kirika 
considered that normality, and its position in her life. She realised 
that for her, this was more normal than anything else.

******

Dominique walked through the halls of Ishinomori Tower, the 
chrome-panelled stretches still and quiet in this late evening hour; the 
night in essence, an hour to be in your bed. An hour for other people to 
be, not her. Her business attire of the day was still her garb, it now 
feeling constricting and wrinkled and unclean after the too many hours 
of wear. The micromanagement of an empire seemed to be an everlasting 
job. However, it was not paperwork that saw her awake this night.

Beyond the broad plexiglass windows that swept by Dominique&#39;s left 
shoulder the lights of Yokohama glittered like gems on black velvet, a 
scattering of all kinds and shapes and sizes. Every jewel below down to 
the smallest twinkle belonged to Dominique&#39;s enclave and the Ishinomori 
clan. Paid for in blood and lives, but paid in full. Vengeance had been 
bought in Yokohama. Be that as it may, it was a single city with 
millions still owed.

As peaceful as the corridors were, they were not empty. Still, yes, but 
Dominique never found herself alone in any of them for long. With the 
exactitude in which the appointed guards for tonight&#39;s shift stood, 
forever at attention in their black apparel, the halls may have well 
been deemed empty. Only those sisters with a background in combat and 
experience to ripen it pulled this duty; there were not so few true 
Soldats adherents that every sister, even the more academically inclined 
and those learned merely in the theories of war, were called in as a 
garrison, or to take part in the actual fighting for that matter. The 
chosen women took their task seriously, evident by their vigilant eyes 
and alert posture, and in the face of the sense of security afforded 
behind thick walls and sometimes at the lofty heights of dozens of 
storeys.

The sentries&#39; scanning eyes slowed on Dominique no more than a moment 
before moving on to windows and intersections and doorways. They knew 
her, of course. Some favoured her with nods or even smiles, which she 
returned in kind, if perhaps a lesser nod or smaller smile. Dominique 
belonged to their sisterhood, once an equal among them under Altena, but 
she had to be their leader now, and in that role slightly apart from 
them. Above them. People needed leaders and the order they instilled. 
Especially in times like these.

Kaede&#39;s apartments were Dominique&#39;s destination. Two guards flanking the 
doors were there to see her arrival, the women&#39;s presence and faces 
familiar, as was hers to them, Dominique surmised. She visited Kaede 
often enough for every sister assigned to protect the child to be 
accustomed to her appearance.

&quot;She&#39;s awake,&quot; Violeta said in her sultry Romanian accent once Dominique 
was within a few paces of the doors, her head, covered in a cap of dark 
curls, inclining a little toward them. Nicola meanwhile had already 
dismissed Dominique and resumed her watch of the surrounds. Violeta 
didn&#39;t spend a second longer to do the same. Dominique had known neither 
before the collapse of Le Grand Retour, but every sister here was bonded 
all the stronger to one another now, and, she hoped, trusted each other 
unreservedly with their lives. It had been rumoured that Nicola had been 
at the Manor during the end, but Dominique wrote it off as a fable. 
Nicola looked hardy with her very short cropped bleached blonde hair, 
gaunt features, and wiry frame, but no one who had been on that sacred 
ground then had survived Noir&#39;s unleashing. The orphan and the noble... 
never before in centuries past had the Black Hands turned their blades 
on their keepers if the records were true. Why they had in this century, 
with the iron-willed Altena as their Kind Mother no less, was knowledge 
no sister possessed. Even the resident rumour mill couldn&#39;t fathom a 
reason for their rampage, or had lent enough weight to one for it to 
circulate.

Dominique didn&#39;t knock, however she did slip inside Kaede&#39;s quarters 
with nary a murmur. Kaede had retired for the evening, yet Dominique 
wasn&#39;t expecting her to be asleep. But the night was a time for quiet, 
and Kaede was seldom without bedroom companionship. Those &#39;companions&#39; 
weren&#39;t afflicted as she. Few were.

The harsh fluorescent lighting of the halls reached inside the moonlit 
twilight despite Dominique&#39;s unobtrusive entry, but the woman quickly 
and silently shut it outside with the doors, leaving only the meagre yet 
bright seepage through the crack at the floor. It took a second of 
staring into the gloom for Dominique&#39;s eyes to become attuned to it over 
the vivid light from earlier and for the painfully recognisable room to 
take sharper shape. It stung every time Dominique crossed its threshold 
and dared to lift her head to the reality, the wound dulled with age but 
still there to hurt. And considering the great number of occasions she 
did step inside, it was almost masochistic of her. The apartments were 
another inheritance of Kaede&#39;s, lived in by her mother when she was 
still a part of this world. It was an intimate inheritance, more 
personal; perhaps the most personal apart from blood itself; and telling 
of the woman who it had belonged to. The same pastel lounge furniture, 
peaches and creams, the same abstract paintings and alien sculptures and 
statues. Kaede had not cared enough to change anything, or maybe it was 
the hurt in her heart of the same sort as Dominique&#39;s that had seen time 
frozen. She had to have memories of the time spent with her mother here, 
just as Dominique had of what had been her lover.

Romantic days and passionate nights... Hikaru in the golden sunrise, in 
the pale moonlight.... if there was ever an angel belonging in Heaven, 
it had been her. Dominique wished she hadn&#39;t been called home so soon.

Dominique shut her eyes, dismayed at losing her grip over her pain. Time 
had not dulled it; it was she who had smothered it thus. She didn&#39;t know 
what it was like for Kaede, but for her each memory of Hikaru was a barb 
to her heart. And each memory took every opportunity to resurface if not 
pushed down with cold deliberation. Indulge in one, and the rest would 
flood you. The happy times were gone, as dead as the woman who had made 
them so. There was just the pain, and that... and *that* Dominique let 
loose upon Soldats. Each barb to her heart was one to tear free and hurl 
at her hated foe.

This night it was Kaede bathed in the light of the moon, every bit as 
beautiful as her mother. She stood in front of a bare window where most 
of the moonlight could fall on her, her white locks shimmering a ghostly 
hue and her ashen complexion luminescent. If not for the shorter hair 
she could have been her. For a moment Dominique almost pandered to the 
ache. How she dreamed she could.

For Kaede a bed was seldom used for sleep. A troubled mind and a 
troubled spirit bred incurable insomnia, something Dominique suffered in 
mercifully a lesser degree. But Dominique had her share of restless 
nights wrought with fitful nightmares. She still did.

Dominique had suggested sleeping tablets, a resort she herself sometimes 
yielded to, but Kaede refused to &#39;defile&#39; her body with drugs, 
irrespective of how beneficial they were. Odd, maybe, when the child 
manufactured thousands of them and sold more of all types, the bulk not 
so beneficial. Although, a brewer of poisons rarely ingested their own 
concoctions now, didn&#39;t they? Bar the sleeping aids, it wasn&#39;t as though 
Dominique snorted cocaine with her coffee.

A robe was arranged carelessly around Kaede&#39;s toned body, its 
silvery-grey silk adopting a shadowed sheen against her skin. It gaped 
open, its tie dangling heedlessly above the carpet, and baring entirely 
too much for the casual observer. Yes, these were her apartments, but 
really! The respect Kaede had for her body&#39;s insides didn&#39;t incorporate 
its outsides. Dominique had attempted to teach the child a sense of 
propriety, but Kaede was too much of a cavalier soul for it to stick... 
or for her to make any sort of decent effort to help it so. Or perhaps 
her mind was too focused on more important things to worry about proper 
decorum. Dominique supposed she should be grateful Kaede wasn&#39;t 
completely naked. Yet when merely your arms, back, and some of your legs 
were concealed, naked might already be an accurate description.

Kaede&#39;s... pets... didn&#39;t have the same ambiguity. They had the cover of 
naught but their skin, not so much as a stocking on a leg. The hills and 
valleys of the dishevelled sheets they loafed among hid little, doing 
more to accentuate their state of undress with the insinuation the messy 
bed supplied. Evidence enough of what Kaede really used a bed for. Maybe 
she found salvation in Claire and Fumiko&#39;s arms, peace; an escape from 
her turmoil in the hazy pleasures their bodies could bestow. But like 
the sleeping pills Dominique prescribed, it was a short-lived oblivion. 
They both had their methods, neither of which the other approved of. 
Kaede&#39;s choice was not for Dominique. Only one distinct woman could ever 
share her bed. Only one.

Across the room and through the open bedroom door Claire sprawled, awake 
and staring in the dark. On her stomach, her back arched and body 
sinuous, she was like a coiled serpent rearing its head, her ringlets a 
gorgon&#39;s wig. Stunning, sensuality in red, she oozed seduction all the 
way to Dominique. Dominique regarded her evenly. No heady lust raged; no 
desire was kindled. Claire was simply a woman in the nude; something 
Dominique saw every morning she dressed and every night she undressed. 
Fumiko, huddled into a semblance of a ball on the other side of the bed 
with her bare back to Claire and just as naked, was observed with equal 
apathy. Only one.

Claire&#39;s impish face held no warmth or smiles for Dominique, and these 
days Kaede herself, whom the sister owed it to, didn&#39;t see either as 
often as she should. Like a snake indeed Claire was becoming, shedding 
her silken skin for an abrasive hide. Dominique should have anticipated 
it. Of course Claire would come to resent her, and Kaede too even, her 
duty personified. Being ordered to become a whore would embitter most. 
Dominique supposed it was for the good that Claire had her anger. As 
long as she didn&#39;t crumble like Fumiko. Anything but that.

Besides, Dominique wasn&#39;t really whoring Claire out to Kaede. It was 
more in the vein of matchmaking. For her faults, Claire was a fine 
sister and woman with the strength of spirit to manage Kaede. And yet... 
yet, it had pained Dominique to give the order. Even now, irrational 
jealousy spiked that she tried very hard not to analyse. She was 
frustrated that Kaede seemed to view Claire as merely a concubine, but 
she was rather happy as well. Dominique was aware more must form between 
the two young women; she planned it, needed it... but she did not wish 
it.

Claire turned up her cute nose at Dominique, the older woman imagining 
the sniff the younger gave, and then gradually settled her head on her 
forearms and closed her eyes, more a match with a hound in slumber now. 
Dominique preferred the hound to the serpent. Hounds still had a bite, 
but they were loyal, and lacked the venom. What Claire must become.

&quot;Children should be sleeping...&quot; Dominique said quietly in the tone set 
by the late hour. Kaede&#39;s nakedness wandered into her gaze to taunt it 
with immodesty as she turned her head, but she didn&#39;t think of averting 
her eyes. It was too common an exhibition, such that she didn&#39;t so much 
as remember her decision to enter without a knock, nor would she rethink 
it even if she could. The indecency had matured to become as normal as 
decent was.

&quot;I&#39;m far from a child,&quot; Kaede replied with unexpected clarity. She was 
more centred than usual tonight. And in her lucidness she was right. 
That athletic and well-rounded body was not of a child&#39;s. In baring all 
Kaede had nothing to be ashamed of. There was immodesty, yes, but never 
obscenity. She was more exquisite than any work of art in the room, nay, 
the building. Kaede had been sculpted with the same angel who had 
birthed her in mind.

&quot;Yes...&quot; Dominique said, walking over to stand behind her precious 
charge. &quot;In some respects,&quot; she conditionally conceded with a 
light-hearted smile for the child&#39;s faint reflection in the window. She 
placed a hand on Kaede&#39;s shoulder, sleek with the thin silk. The 
unconscious desire to stroke that hand over the smoothness and down 
Kaede&#39;s arm itched her palm. Dominique squeezed gently to rein the urge 
in, and then recalled why she was here... after some effort.

Dominique had come to check on Kaede. Kaede&#39;s trial for drug related 
charges was tomorrow--today, if time wore on a little further--and the 
young woman would be leaving the tower to be present. It was meaningless 
to attend, really. The indictment shouldn&#39;t have proceeded beyond a 
hearing. The whistleblower had been silenced and the foundation of the 
prosecution&#39;s case had been demolished as a consequence. Kaede would be 
in and out of that courtroom in a matter of minutes, vindicated in the 
eyes of the law if not in the media&#39;s and public&#39;s. Suspicions would 
linger for a time, naturally, but Ishinomori Pharmaceutical&#39;s share 
price would recoup, Dominique predicted with certainty.

It wasn&#39;t the open and shut case that had Dominique fretting. It would 
be the first occasion Kaede had been outside in... in longer than 
Dominique could recollect. There was safety in Ishinomori Tower, but in 
the streets....

Dominique gripped Kaede&#39;s shoulder harder and swallowed the slight lump 
swelling in her throat as though it were the awful memories gathering. 
It was probably more for her own benefit that she had sought out Kaede. 
Kaede&#39;s motorcade would have the best defences and an escort of the most 
capable sisters willing to lay down their lives for her. Moreover, 
Dominique would be there. She would *ensure* history didn&#39;t stray into 
the present. If the worst happened, it would be different this time. 
Dominique would do what she should have done those years ago.

Dominique blinked in surprise when she felt Kaede&#39;s hand atop hers, and 
was surprised again when tears had to be blinked back. She cursed 
herself for the thaw in her icy shield and took a deep, and to her 
disgrace, shuddering breath to help rebuild it. No one could see how 
profoundly she hurt, but above all Kaede could not see. Dominique must 
not compound the girl&#39;s anguish with the showing of her own. Dominique 
had to be the ice to her fire. She had to be strong in her own way.

&quot;Do you think they are watching?&quot;

Dominique knew Kaede meant both her parents, a dishonour she didn&#39;t 
rectify. The day would come when the truth was told, but not before the 
child was ready to hear it. &quot;I know she is,&quot; Dominique whispered, 
closing her eyes. Watching, and waiting. Dominique prayed her soul was 
still clean enough for Heaven. Knowing Hikaru, she would drag Dominique 
up there no matter how dirty it was. The thought helped to settle her. 
They&#39;d be together again.

&quot;Blood and fire... we&#39;ll cleanse their sin in blood and fire,&quot; Kaede 
said, nearing a sneer at the end. What hold she had on her mind was 
slipping, it fracturing again. &quot;Even on high, they will see the flames 
and hear their screams.&quot;

Dominique didn&#39;t reply to the madness or voice her worries--she had 
never intended to--but she allowed herself to lean forwards, pressing 
against Kaede&#39;s strong back. She smelt the same... the light scent of 
the prettiest flowers. She wielded a sword and waged a war, but there 
was still one angel left on earth.

Kirika reclined on the bed; her arms dead at her sides while her eyes 
were glass reflecting the ceiling that was slowly becoming charted with 
each night&#39;s survey. She looked a vacant shell save for the rise and 
fall of her chest. But contained within was ample thought and feeling, 
life aplenty to greatly contradict the dearth outside.

Mireille&#39;s plans were still fresh in Kirika&#39;s mind, the blonde&#39;s and 
those of Yokohama District Court that the woman had unfurled from 
somewhere. Information provided by that nervous Soldats man, probably. 
Kirika didn&#39;t mull over those background details too much. If Mireille 
had judged the blueprints worth their inspection and memorisation, then 
they were. Kirika had committed every room and hallway and stairwell to 
a pocket of her memory, ready to be pulled out and unfurled within her 
mind when they were needed. There were other plans of other buildings in 
that pocket, their lines blurred with age whilst others missed huge 
chunks of sections, and others still were just a shadowed outline of a 
perimeter. Nevertheless, they were still there. There could come a day 
when they were required again, and it would only take one reminder for 
the hazy rooms to become solid and the corridors to lead to all the 
right locations. It was not that Kirika actively strived to remember the 
places she had been. Truly, there were many she wished she could forget 
together with what bloody events had transpired at each. Despite that 
longing, she simply couldn&#39;t forget them. It could be that it was 
unconscious on her part, with every memory that was hers grasped onto 
and never let go, as though they could compensate for the gaps in the 
jigsaw puzzle that was her past life.

Kirika&#39;s gun was wedged between the bed&#39;s frame and the mattress at head 
height, secreted and close... and clean and oiled and loaded, primed for 
the blood-red dawn. It was ready--it was always ready. And Kirika... she 
was always ready too. The sand had almost run out, the final sun fallen 
beneath the horizon, and she grieved... but she was prepared for the 
darkness. Sin was abhorrent... the thought of it, anyway. Once it was 
upon her, she reacted like a sinner should. Kirika didn&#39;t enjoy it, but 
it would happen. She thought of the dawn further ahead, the one that 
spelled the last of the dark day. Peace would come again.

The whisper in her head rustled like browned leaves about to fall, but 
she thought harder of the sunrise until it went quiet. Home was through 
that light. Kirika would have to fight to it, kill for it. She would do 
what she had to. She would do what she was best at. And then she would 
abandon the courthouse to her memory, hoping to forget the lives she had 
traded for her own inner contentment... and how insignificant it had 
felt when she had taken them. She never would, of course. Guilt over not 
feeling guilty... did that make her still human some? Or was it the 
weeping of a demon, plaintive of what she was? The whisper had answers 
for Kirika, but she couldn&#39;t trust it. Would Mireille know? Would an 
angel understand her plights?

The angel chose then to make her entrance into the bedroom; sans wings 
for her own sins she bore. Mireille was in her pyjamas like Kirika; her 
baggy nightshirt; set for bed. It was the weapon in her hand that said 
she was set for more.

Mireille slid the clip from the Walther P99, checked it, and then 
reloaded it. Kirika&#39;s gaze sharpened. Mireille was still beautiful 
standing in the doorway, even armed so. Kirika didn&#39;t know if it was the 
prolonged staring or from emotion that her eyes began to tear. Maybe it 
was a melange of both, each feeding on the other in a loop of adoration. 
From head to foot the woman was transcendent, Kirika&#39;s better half, the 
light in her life. Sin had brought Kirika to Mireille; they were joined 
by it. Somehow, sin had wrought a love unbreakable. How something of 
that grandeur could grow from shadow and death was unimaginable. Kirika 
wondered if it had been the same for every Noir before them. However, it 
felt like nothing in history could ever compare to this union, this 
passion--this love. Or ever would.

Mireille switched off the stand lamp, plunging the room into a twilight 
that the orangey-yellow glow of a streetlight strained valiantly to 
dispel. Valiantly, but it was a vain aspiration wrung through the fibres 
of the closed curtains. Nonetheless, Kirika was appreciative of its 
attempt. It wasn&#39;t the dark of the room she was cagey of; the generic 
gloom was nothing, harmless, to that which polluted the world, veiled 
her mind, and was a stain on her soul; but it couldn&#39;t hurt to repel it 
too.

Mireille rounded the foot of the bed to her side of it, bringing her gun 
with her. She bent down to cram the pistol inside the makeshift holster 
of bed frame and mattress as Kirika had done on the opposite side, and 
then turned down the sheets and slipped beneath them. Kirika lifted her 
knees to her chest and rocked backwards, and with her hands she lowered 
her half of the covers out from under her bottom and then pulled them up 
over her legs as she straightened the sinewy limbs toward the end of the 
bed. Snug within the blanket cocoon, Kirika and Mireille lay side by 
side on their backs in silence, wide-awake and blinking at the morphing 
shadows on the ceiling inked by the filtered streetlamp illumination and 
sketched on the whimsy of the wind through tree leaves outside the 
window.

&quot;Let&#39;s have tea when we get back home,&quot; Mireille announced out of the 
blue into the darkness.

Surprised, Kirika turned her head on her pillow to Mireille, and was 
greeted by the woman&#39;s bright smiling face already turned her way and 
waiting for her. &quot;Orange Peko,&quot; Mireille said through her fond 
expression. Orange Peko was the first tea Kirika had learned to brew, 
and to her disappointment was pretty much still the only tea today she 
could make that was appetising to Mireille&#39;s fine standards. Fortunately 
the flavour seemed to be one of Mireille favourites. Kirika supposed it 
was her own favourite, too.

Kirika returned the smile, although it was small and shy in comparison. 
She felt the nip of swelling teardrops perched on her eyelids again. It 
could be that Mireille was just trying to cheer her up with thoughts of 
the pleasantries that awaited them back in Paris, but Kirika believed 
she wasn&#39;t by herself in her desire for home. Mireille was more than a 
physical presence of splendour and support; she was with Kirika in every 
respect and for every step. Home was sanctuary for them *both*, and they 
were both in the struggle to earn safe passage back to it. Mireille 
often appeared a pinnacle of leadership, gallant and dependable, 
unflappable, on top of every problem and situation of life&#39;s making. She 
was a cold assassin and an astute woman, the strategist and the 
caretaker. Kirika didn&#39;t think Mireille ever possessed the same sort of 
worries that weighed on her heart and mind. Mireille was on another 
plane entirely, unfettered by such uncertainty and woe. Or so was 
Kirika&#39;s regular impression. She forgot sometimes that Mireille, 
although more angelic than human, yet had feelings. There were some 
sentiments that flowed between them despite the boundaries of wisdom and 
maturity. Love, being the most notable and brilliant of all.

Mireille lifted her right arm across her body to Kirika while the other 
moved above the girl&#39;s head; a potential embrace open and inviting, cosy 
and idyllic and always sought after. Seeing Kirika bat her eyes a couple 
of times in perplexity, the blonde arched a wry eyebrow. &quot;You&#39;ll wind up 
here anyway,&quot; Mireille explained dryly, though mitigated by a smirk that 
was anything but. &quot;Why bother waiting.&quot; She looked away nonchalantly, as 
if it were nothing, however Kirika could tell her partner&#39;s focus was 
still glued firmly on her.

Kirika&#39;s chin neared her chest as she dropped her head, feeling chagrin 
for her little habit. But not so much that it overshadowed the memory of 
the delight she got from it, snuggled against her beloved Mireille. And 
to have it completely sanctioned this time! Held against Mireille by the 
woman&#39;s own accepting arms....

Kirika swallowed, but she hesitated no longer in scooting across the bed 
and eliminating the space between herself and Mireille. Mireille&#39;s arms 
settled around her once she was pressed to the blonde&#39;s perfect form. It 
was Heaven&#39;s embrace.

Mireille&#39;s hand covered Kirika&#39;s smaller own where it was just below the 
woman&#39;s gently rising and falling chest. Kirika could feel the body next 
to her own relax, and she knew Mireille had closed her eyes. Kirika 
released contentment in a breath, and then allowed her eyelids to droop 
and then close too. The final grains of peace passing through the 
hourglass.

&lt;&#39;If you want peace, you must prepare for war&#39;.&gt;

It rang like a tenet in Kirika&#39;s head even though it began as Altena&#39;s 
whispered voice, invoking a resonance of a faraway thought. A thought 
she couldn&#39;t grasp, only see the image of behind a pane of glass. It was 
shaped like a missing jigsaw piece.

No matter whose memory it belonged to or who had said it, there was a 
grudging truth in it. Kirika slept satisfied and serene in Mireille&#39;s 
arms, but when the dawn of war arose next morning, she was awake to see 
it.</pre>
