&quot;Twenty-two people. *Dead*. Most of them linked with your family&#39;s 
company-- bodyguards, right?--and two I *know* run with *your* group; 
your... &#39;Kanagawa Kotetsu&#39;.&quot; The young inspector sucked on his 
cigarette--Ryosuke hadn&#39;t bothered to catch his name when he&#39;d announced 
it after flashing his badge, waving the thing around with the arrogance 
authority afforded, like a kid with a toy no one else had--and breathed 
smoke into the air out through his nose, in the manner of a snorting 
bull caricature. His eyes darted back and forth through the slowly 
rising wispy grey plumes to where yakuza still loitered, although under 
the wary scrutiny of more police officers.

Ryosuke stared at the ashen nub that lit up in the man&#39;s fingers during 
his drag. The courthouse&#39;s no-smoking rule didn&#39;t apply to the inspector 
it seemed. But of course--he belonged to the rule makers.

&quot;The rest were civilians,&quot; the inspector blathered on, big shot for a 
day. He was making the most of his soapbox time. &quot;And *cops*. Good men 
that didn&#39;t deserve it. Men with families. Men with *worth*, unlike you 
and your punks!&quot; Another jittery puff on his cigarette, and the scent of 
smoke teasing Ryosuke&#39;s nostrils, mocking his deprivation. &quot;I know you 
know what&#39;s going on. Yokohama&#39;s turned into a... a...&quot; he shook his 
head and flicked some ash onto the lobby&#39;s floor, &quot;...an American city. 
Homicides are becoming the norm, and they&#39;re being committed with 
firearms. *Illegal* firearms. Not just the peashooters I know you scum 
have, but serious hardware. For fuck&#39;s sake there was an RPG attack out 
there!&quot; The inspector gestured heatedly toward the foyer&#39;s exit and the 
cordoned off street that lay beyond, flinging ash and embers. &quot;Shit like 
that had to come from somewhere, and *someone* is doing the killing with 
them.&quot;

The cop bent down to Ryosuke, wagging the two fingers with the cigarette 
in the seated gangster&#39;s face. &quot;And I know you know something. The gangs 
are pretty much sitting back, except for *yours*. The victims are 
random; lowlifes to law-abiding salarymen. Solitary murders to massacres 
of scores of individuals. And now your little pharmaceutical company&#39;s 
&#39;employees&#39;. A lot of bodyguards to bring to a trial. Were you worried 
about something? Or just wanting to put on airs? Nice coincidence they 
were actually needed. Not so nice for them though, eh?&quot; He blew smoke in 
Ryosuke&#39;s face, but the stony killer didn&#39;t so much as bat an eye. &quot;Who 
was it, Ryosuke? Who&#39;s doing this?&quot; The inspector had lowered his voice; 
secretive and coaxing, as though Ryosuke was some two-bit thug who sang 
to the Satsu after they applied the slightest pressure, or after they 
pathetically pretended to be a sympathetic ear.   

&quot;You&#39;re the police. It&#39;s your job to protect the people and investigate, 
not beg me for answers,&quot; Ryosuke murmured. In the panicked crowd 
apparently no one had seen him draw his firearm, apart from the woman he 
was aiming for. Without that, the cops had nothing on him--if they had, 
they&#39;d have sent a senior inspector to lean on him, not this young pup.

&quot;They tried to kill your sister. Your *sister*,&quot; the inspector continued 
to push. &quot;That&#39;s your entire family, isn&#39;t it. They&#39;re going to wipe you 
out, just like your mother and father.&quot; He sneered now, low and mean; no 
longer a friend.

&quot;Enough with your feeble rhetoric. We&#39;re both in the dark,&quot; Ryosuke 
responded coolly, the jabs concerning his late parents obvious in their 
intent and weak in carrying it out.

The inspector scoffed and straightened. &quot;Why don&#39;t I haul your ass down 
to the precinct and give you a *proper* interrogation? Check to see if 
you and your pals are packing? Is that how you want it? Maybe one of the 
bullets we dig out of the corpses here will match one of your guns, 
hmm?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re wasting your time,&quot; Ryosuke said evenly, unflappable. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
kill anyone... today.&quot;

The policeman scoffed again. &quot;You think you&#39;re hot shit, don&#39;t you.&quot; 
Seeming to realise the futility of harping on to Ryosuke, he began to 
walk away to find better use for his time. &quot;Maybe next time I see you 
I&#39;ll be covering *you* with a sheet.&quot;

&quot;If it must be so,&quot; Ryosuke said softly, mainly to himself. He sat 
forwards, elbows on his knees, and took out a cigarette and his lighter, 
sparking a flame into life.  

&quot;Hey,&quot; the inspector called, turning back. He smirked obnoxiously. 
&quot;There&#39;s no smoking here.&quot;

Ryosuke snapped his lighter shut and watched the cop finally go, smoke 
ribbons following after him. He&#39;d never met a cop he liked, and it 
seemed today wouldn&#39;t be changing that. But they were on different sides 
of the law; lived in different societies--it was the natural order of 
things.

Ryosuke stared blankly ahead, however the scene around him was at odds 
with his disinterest. Cops in suits clustered in small gatherings spread 
across Yokohama District Courthouse&#39;s lobby; every once in a while one 
leaving and a new one joining, the latter typically snapping off latex 
gloves or pocketing a notebook as they did. Their uniformed lessers had 
their hands full keeping the curious public and media outside and the 
courthouse staff from getting underfoot... and also ensuring Ryosuke&#39;s 
brothers didn&#39;t inexplicably create some kind of fuss in the lobby&#39;s 
lounge--unbeknownst to them a very easy and ultimately unnecessary duty. 
Natural order of things, Ryosuke wearily reminded himself.

Paramedics killed time on the courthouse steps, probably awaiting the 
word to cart off the bodies once the police had done whatever it was 
they were doing. Forensics and chalk outlines if they still did that 
sort of thing. They&#39;d be drawing them for a while.

The inspector hadn&#39;t mentioned them, but there had been plenty of 
wounded for the ambulance personnel to treat and several to rush to 
hospital sirens blaring, however everything had cooled down in the last 
hour. All court affairs had been cancelled and rescheduled for another 
day too, voiding the majority of the building, although Ryosuke 
suspected some of this morning&#39;s visitors still remained, providing 
witness statements to the Satsu. He bet their interviews were being 
conducted more cordially than his and his fellow yakuza&#39;s had been, but 
in any case he was sure they had given up little more useful information 
to the cops than he and his tight-lipped gang had. Ryosuke wondered if 
Dominique&#39;s Soldats rebels had been interrogated and what they had said, 
if any had survived to be questioned that was. It was the dead that had 
all the answers the police were looking for. Wasn&#39;t that always the 
case.    

The lobby&#39;s lounge was where the Kanagawa Kotetsu&#39;s second found 
himself, waiting with his comrades but sitting alone. Most of Kaede&#39;s 
Kanagawa Kotetsu entourage had been sent home to gang offices or back to 
Ishinomori Tower; the remaining few stuck by Ryosuke out of dedication 
or the mildly insulting belief he needed the protection--yet 
understandable considering the morning&#39;s events--and two no longer had 
the life in them to walk out of here.  

&quot;Yo.&quot;

Ryosuke&#39;s eyes swung to and focused on Ken as the man hobbled up to him, 
his right pant leg bloodied and split down the outer side. He had been 
among the people that the paramedics had ministered to in the backs of 
ambulances assembled in fleets on the street outside. Thankfully Ken&#39;s 
injury was not in the &#39;rush to hospital&#39; category which put 
survivability up in the air. He had acted courageously and selflessly, 
plucking Ryosuke&#39;s sister from what should have been death; his own 
death would&#39;ve been a regretful cost for his noble actions, and 
undeserving. He&#39;d never say it openly, but Ryosuke was indebted to him. 
However, Ken&#39;s behaviour wasn&#39;t a new marvel. For him, the gang, and its 
boss, came before anything, even if it landed him in trouble meant for 
them.

Ken dropped onto the couch beside Ryosuke, slouching slovenly into the 
cushions. The pant leg fell open as he sat, bandages wrapped around his 
thigh peeking through.  

&quot;How&#39;s the leg?&quot; Ryosuke asked.

&quot;This? A scratch. Had worse after that night in Shibuya with Jun. 
Remember that? She was a beauty. Too good for me, but she was 
charitable.&quot; Ken grinned lopsidedly and nudged Ryosuke with his elbow. 
He was in high spirits for almost getting killed. &quot;I&#39;ll have a limp for 
a couple of days, maybe,&quot; he said, sobering up a tad. &quot;Nothing that&#39;ll 
slow me down.&quot; He fingered the surgical cut made along his trouser leg 
by the ambulance personnel. &quot;Bitch that they had to trash my suit. It 
was one of my favourites.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you have plenty more like it.&quot; It was too stereotypical yakuza 
for him not to.

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Ken admitted, almost sheepishly. &quot;But that&#39;s not the 
point. It&#39;s mine. And it wasn&#39;t cheap.&quot;

For Ken, he hadn&#39;t had a choice in staying with Ryosuke or leaving, 
owing to the cops dragging him off behind the doors of the lobby&#39;s 
security office straight after he&#39;d been patched up. The grilling the 
Satsu had given him had probably been severe; certainly more so than the 
fairly brief bullying Ryosuke had received. Ken had been missing for 
nearly two hours, that alone telling of the police&#39;s keen interest in 
him. He&#39;d been one of the rare survivors directly involved in the 
violence, and if not a chief suspect in several of the murders, then a 
chief witness. Ryosuke was surprised the cops hadn&#39;t held him for at 
least twenty-four hours. He was surprised they hadn&#39;t held everyone from 
his gang just out of spite.   

Ken rubbed the black fuzz on top of his head. &quot;I lost all my guns. Good 
thing, I guess. I&#39;d nothing incriminating on me. Just an innocent 
bystander who got lucky; that&#39;s me, heh. The Satsu that saw me bust 
through the checkpoint are dead too, which helped. Dead men tell no 
tales, eh, aniki?&quot;

&quot;No. They don&#39;t,&quot; Ryosuke said. &quot;Can the guns be traced back to you?&quot;

&quot;Nah. Serials filed off, standard stuff. Jokers don&#39;t have my prints, 
either.&quot;

Ryosuke didn&#39;t need to ask Ken if he&#39;d mentioned anything the cops could 
use against them or even Dominique&#39;s people. If offered the choice 
earlier, Ken would have been among those who stayed at Ryosuke&#39;s side, 
gunshot wound be damned.

Ryosuke sighed. &quot;Takeo and Nobuo?&quot;

Ken released a longer, more forceful breath. &quot;They died well.&quot;

No, Ryosuke thought, they had just died. Dead was dead--whatever honour 
they had earned meant nothing to them now.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell their families,&quot; Ken said, sombrely taking on the duty this 
time. He&#39;d go personally, into homes often where the bitter abuse of 
heartbroken parents and siblings waited, or worse, sobbing wives or 
girlfriends and confused children. It was sadder still when the fallen 
had no kin or lover to mourn their passing, where family had been the 
gang itself. Ryosuke liked to think that he and his brothers had 
provided those lonely men with something before the grave, but sleepless 
nights featuring old faces rising from his memory spoke of his doubt.

Too many times Ryosuke and Ken had had to darken families&#39; doorsteps as 
bearers of bleak news no one wanted to hear. Too many dead, and too many 
for no good reason. Word on the streets was the Kanagawa Kotetsu was 
bleeding, and it looked mortal. No young men came to the group&#39;s offices 
seeking recruitment, and those whose loyalty or nerve was flagging ended 
up disappearing one day. Ryosuke and Ken disciplined those they managed 
to track down with a han-goroshi--a vicious beating--but Ryosuke&#39;s heart 
wasn&#39;t in it, and afterwards he let them go without looking back. He 
understood. The smart ones ran far, far away... to the country, or to 
Kansai, or south to Okinawa. Anywhere Soldats was less in the open and 
not on the warpath. The men who still stood by Ryosuke and the 
Ishinomori family were to be lauded. Their guts and faithfulness were 
unique. Men like Takeo and Nobuo had been.

&quot;How did you know there was trouble?&quot; Ryosuke quizzed Ken out of the 
blue, recalling that he himself hadn&#39;t heard the opening gunshots whilst 
hanging around mere metres from the courthouse&#39;s front entrance. 

Ken barked a sour laugh. &quot;I wasn&#39;t totally sure there was, at first,&quot; he 
explained. &quot;I heard gunfire--*real* faint, but damn if I don&#39;t know 
gunfire when I hear it. I didn&#39;t think about it; I just reacted. I took 
off past the security checkpoint with Nobuo and Takeo, and who knows who 
else followed us.&quot; He smirked cynically. &quot;It was lucky we weren&#39;t shot 
by the cops. I guess the other guys who heard me shout and ran after us 
didn&#39;t make it through like we did.&quot; He fell quiet for a moment. &quot;Maybe 
it would have been better if Nobuo and Takeo hadn&#39;t either.&quot; Ken turned 
his head to look squarely at Ryosuke. &quot;I should have called you, aniki. 
I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He dipped his head.

&quot;You reacted,&quot; Ryosuke remarked impassively, neither approving nor 
disapproving. He had brought Kaede out, that&#39;s what was important.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ken grunted, attracting Ryosuke&#39;s attention as he nodded towards 
something in the foyer.

Vin wandered over to them, hands in his pants pockets, his dishevelled 
yellow suit spattered with burgundy spots--dried blood. &quot;Everyone okay?&quot; 
he glibly inquired.

&quot;No,&quot; Ryosuke rumbled back.

Vin seemed taken aback. &quot;Huh? Is Kaede okay? I... misplaced her in the 
mess.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cool, man,&quot; Ken succinctly assured him, not possessing the 
arrogance to elaborate on his pivotal role keeping Ryosuke&#39;s family 
alive.
 
&quot;Two of ours gave their lives,&quot; Ryosuke detailed. &quot;Furthermore there was 
a second attack outside, on the motorcade. Many civilian casualties.&quot;

Vin sucked a breath in through his teeth. &quot;Shit, that&#39;s going to cause 
some bother.&quot; His anxiety was not for the dead and maimed innocents, 
just for the extra attention from the public and police they would 
inspire. Like slaughtered sheep, no one mourned them but other sheep and 
the shepherds. &quot;The cops are already all over me. As usual they 
threatened to deport me and did everything short of a cavity search... 
and there wasn&#39;t a single woman among them.&quot;

&quot;Hah!&quot; Ken chuckled. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t date a cop.&quot;

&quot;Sure I would. If she was cute,&quot; Vin clarified, true to his predictable, 
shallow protocol pertaining to the fairer sex. &quot;And if I *was* going to 
get a cavity search, I&#39;d want a woman doing the violating.&quot;

Ken slapped his knee at that, his laughter charming several of the 
Kanagawa Kotetsu men to draw closer and see what had their senior 
brother in sudden merriment against the tone of the day.

&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Vin reached inside his jacket and pulled out a pinkish 
object. &quot;Here.&quot; He tossed it into Ken&#39;s lap. &quot;Leaving pieces of yourself 
everywhere....&quot; He sighed like he was the other man&#39;s longsuffering 
mother. &quot;It wasn&#39;t easy to snag. Fortunate for you I had the 
opportunity. Just don&#39;t ask me where I hid it.&quot;

Ken&#39;s mirth was cut off despite Vin&#39;s additional joking as he juggled 
with the object on his lap. He picked it up and blinked at it, then 
quickly looked at his left hand. &quot;Damn, I didn&#39;t realise...&quot; he 
whispered, staring at the pinkie stump where the prosthetic should be.  

&quot;So you lost more than just your weapons,&quot; Ryosuke stated. A prosthetic 
specially designed for yakuza found at the scene of over half-a-dozen 
murders was definitely traceable evidence. Ken was too careless too 
often.

&quot;It&#39;s not like I can feel this thing,&quot; Ken protested, screwing the fake 
finger back in its place beside the three real digits and then rapping 
it against one of his thick gold rings on his other hand. &quot;It usually 
doesn&#39;t come off so easy.&quot;

&quot;Your nose,&quot; Ryosuke said, looking at Vin as blood languidly spilled 
from a nostril, stemming at his split upper lip, and serving to let Ken 
off the hook from further reproach.  

Vin gingerly touched his face, over bruises and cuts, and then wiped 
away the blood under his nose. &quot;That little brat fucker,&quot; he vehemently 
cursed, the ferocity of his hateful expression matching the violence 
exhibited on his pummelled visage. He glared at the red smear on his 
finger. &quot;It was *them*,&quot; Vin snarled, his amber gaze lifting to bore 
into Ryosuke with boiling intensity.

&quot;&#39;Them&#39;, who?&quot; Ken queried, out of the loop on France&#39;s resident 
assassins.

Ryosuke merely nodded to his foreign friend; filling in Ken was for a 
later time in a safer environment. Noir. He&#39;d personally seen the French 
woman on the street in front of the courthouse, and with Vin&#39;s scuffle 
against her Asian cohort all doubt was removed--they had followed. 
Dominique&#39;s blunder and Ryosuke&#39;s fears were made flesh. He didn&#39;t ask 
if the girl was at least dead--Vin&#39;s anger wouldn&#39;t be what it was if 
she wasn&#39;t still kicking around. Ryosuke had had a feeling they wouldn&#39;t 
be let off that easy.

The standalone rooftop attack on the motorcade might have been Noir&#39;s 
work, or Soldats. Or were they one in the same? The rockets had been 
suspiciously timely, coinciding with Noir&#39;s assassination attempt and 
turning the best escape route for Kaede and her escort into a firestorm 
that could have seen the young woman killed if not for Ken&#39;s loyalty to 
Ryosuke first, over Dominique and her goons. The French assassin had 
said that Noir were not aligned with Soldats, however it could be 
Ryosuke had caught her in a lie. Why else were she and the other girl 
here? For a book of strange medieval poetry? Dominique gave the 
impression that Langonel&#39;s Manuscript was extremely precious, and 
perhaps Noir knew what she knew about the tome, which had spurred their 
trip across the sea. They had seemed to want it back in that mansion in 
Paris. Or more rationally they were with Soldats from the very 
beginning, and had joined their ally in the street war here in the 
Kanagawa prefecture, their desire for the Langonel&#39;s Manuscript being 
just an excuse, or simply to deny Dominique something she sought.

Whatever Noir&#39;s reasons, they mattered to them only. Ryosuke could have 
done without the renowned contract killers targeting him and his 
comrades, but fate had decided differently. The women had skills and 
plenty more rumoured talent for their underground trade--but they were 
just another enemy, lumped with Soldats, marked for death. Noir would 
die just as easily as anybody else would under the gaze of a gun.

There was one pleasantry to be found in Noir&#39;s appearance. Dominique and 
her associates had suffered the brunt of the assassins&#39; arrival, the 
massacre of her people at last along the same vein of what Ryosuke&#39;s 
losses had been combating Soldats in prior weeks. Ryosuke could almost 
smile. Dominique herself had nearly become a fatality, and for a too 
short instant of mixed bliss at the thought of freedom from her and 
dismay at not inflicting her ruin himself, Ryosuke had believed it true. 
But alas he had subsequently witnessed her stumble away with his hopes, 
led in paramedics&#39; and her soldiers&#39; arms, from the battered armoured 
limousine to later whisk Kaede off home. That woman&#39;s time would come. 
No one lived forever on this side of the law, and old age was rarely the 
reaper&#39;s instrument.

Ryosuke flipped his cigarette between and over his fingers, before 
tossing it to his mouth, catching it between his lips. &quot;Time to go,&quot; he 
said unceremoniously, the cigarette bobbing up and down with his speech. 
Vin was the last of Ryosuke&#39;s men to be accounted for, and fortunately 
was alive. Meeting Noir delivered no guarantees, even for one of the 
Luen Kung Lok triad&#39;s best.          

Ryosuke stood up and lit his cigarette, then proceeded for the exit, his 
hands stuffed in his coat&#39;s pockets. He felt his brothers at his back, 
trailing after him. Through the glass doors at the courthouse entrance 
he noticed the paramedics were gone, surely wheeling out bodies on 
gurneys in either black bags or under white sheets; sort of the carrion 
birds for a modern city.

The police inspector that had questioned him glowered as he and his 
outlaw group sauntered by, as though it were a shock that Ryosuke was 
smoking in the face of consequences. He was young and yet to realise 
that they were his rules, not Ryosuke&#39;s. Ryosuke was meant to defy them; 
he only chose when. There were no angels in disguise where Ryosuke 
tread; there was no grey area, no romantic misunderstood heroes, no 
matter what anybody liked to think. On his side, in *his* society, there 
was only the dead and those that had done the killing, and everyone was 
guilty. People *chose* this life, and they lived ruthlessly by it. And 
thus the police killed criminals, criminals killed the police, criminals 
killed each other, and the rest got in the way. Nearly every outlaw like 
Ryosuke ended their life bloodying a bag or a sheet, or staring at four 
walls of a prison cell. None could help it. It was the natural order of 
things.

******

Dominique cradled Kaede&#39;s head in her lap as the sedan traversed an 
uneven part of the street, bouncing its passengers in their seats. The 
car made short work of the road home, barrelling through red lights and 
stop signs as smoothly as it could, bogged on occasion by unavoidable 
pedestrian interferences. A police squad car paved the way ahead and 
another tailed the sedan, their presence providing license for the hasty 
and uninhibited drive through the city. It wasn&#39;t the manner Dominique 
would have chosen to return to Ishinomori Tower in, but if she&#39;d had the 
luxury of choice she wouldn&#39;t be where she was right now. Besides, to be 
returning at all felt like luxury aplenty.  

Approximately an hour earlier Dominique had woken up to the faces of 
paramedics hovering over her, and the sensation of hard, rough tarmac 
digging into her back. And then the pain had come. It was later reported 
to Dominique that her motorcade had been the subject of two RPG hits-- 
doubtless presents courtesy of Soldats; it was too crude for the 
surgical instruments Noir are. The blast had knocked her off her feet 
and into unconsciousness, but fortune had orchestrated her escape from 
serious injury or even death. Bumps, bruises and a concussion, and not 
to mention the bullet hole through her arm--that was the woman&#39;s tally 
of injuries for the morning. Not too severe, considering she had met 
Noir face-to-face. The thought did nothing to dampen the aches and 
pains, however.  

Her sisters had assisted in dragging her away from the wreckage into 
further paramedic care waiting in one of the ambulances that were 
suddenly crowding the street along with police vehicles. Some of those 
sisters had had wounds of their own, but a larger number were beyond 
what modern medicine could administer. It was not pretty, but the women 
had died for their cause; Dominique was certain they were at peace in 
the afterlife.   

Her arm was bandaged and in a sling, her deepest cuts had been cleaned 
and plastered, and a hearty dose of numbing painkillers had been 
injected into her veins. She had been uneasy throughout the ambulance 
personnel&#39;s attention and dismissed a visit to the hospital, fearing 
successive attacks from Noir or Soldats while she was out in the open 
and vulnerable, however none came. Still, Dominique had gathered her 
able-bodied sisters to guard her, and, chiefly, to watch over Kaede and 
bring the girl to the safety found at her side. Noir had tested that 
safety and revealed it to be far from absolute, but it was still the 
best Dominique could offer. Better than what Kaede&#39;s brother and his 
rabble could muster, in any case.   

Dominique&#39;s agitation remained with her; she didn&#39;t feel it would depart 
until she had Kaede within the walls of Ishinomori Tower again. The car 
they were in was meant to be one of their escort vehicles, not one they 
actually travelled in. The limousine, while intact despite its fiery and 
explosive encounter and probably still drivable, had been impounded by 
the metropolitan police for ballistic tests or for evidence or some such 
annoyance. Dominique would have liked its armour shell around her and 
Kaede instead of the much more lightly reinforced chassis of the sedan, 
however better the latter than riding in one of the police patrol cars 
chaperoning them, as some of her sisters were forced to do. They would 
stand no chance against a determined Soldats assault, just as their 
occupants would not.

Fortuitously the police&#39;s intrusion stopped there. Nobody that Dominique 
vouched for had been taken aside to be interviewed in spite of the major 
incident on official city property and her sisters&#39; obvious bearing of 
arms and intimate involvement. Mentioning the need for a multitude of 
translators for all the foreigners in her employ had probably persuaded 
the law some--and of course her so sadly having no translators she could 
lend to aid them with their inquiries--but with the paid off courthouse 
officers, none wearing a badge were likely eager to detain her or her 
sisters and perhaps have their payoff come to light. The results of the 
interviews would invariably bring up questions that the public would 
look to the police to answer, and then their corruption would only be 
evaded so long. Dominique didn&#39;t expect to have to talk to the police at 
all.  

With her unbound hand, Dominique teased a lock of Kaede&#39;s hair behind 
her ear. It was a miracle the girl was here with her now, without as 
much as a scratch. Dominique wished she could credit Kaede&#39;s good health 
and survival to the loyal defence her sisters&#39; had put up, but she was 
not the type to delude herself with misplaced optimism. The women had 
played their part, however it was luck that had been Kaede&#39;s greatest 
ally. And *that* had Dominique very scared. At any moment in the 
maelstrom she might have lost the child; a helpless babe no less; to a 
twist of fate that would collide her with a bullet, or have her caught 
in an explosion. It had been a mistake to bring her outside of her home. 
Kaede&#39;s appearance had been necessary at the district court, but 
Dominique should have thought of a way around it, to--!

Dominique took a breath, and released it slowly. It was futile getting 
worked up after the fact. Kaede was all right. They would be home 
momentarily. She had to think forward; focus on the future that *could* 
be changed, and utilise the wisdom garnered from past experiences to 
improve that future.

Kaede dozed, snuggled into Dominique&#39;s lap, unresponsive and docile 
since the attack. Dominique wondered if the girl had any understanding 
of what had occurred, or if recollection of the events had been ripped 
asunder somewhere in that muddled mind of hers. Such memories were best 
suited for forgetting; Dominique wouldn&#39;t shed a tear if Kaede could not 
remember this morning.

Dominique touched her thumb to one pale cheek and drew it lightly 
downwards. The skin beneath dimpled; it was so soft and silky--so 
perfect, like hers had been. Kaede&#39;s fate would not be like her 
mother&#39;s. Dominique wasn&#39;t confident she would survive a second hell.  

She glanced surreptitiously at the other backseat passenger, that 
Dominique wasn&#39;t alone with Kaede tainting their quiet time together and 
the French woman&#39;s similarly quiet reflection. Most occasions it was 
challenging to remember that Fumiko was there; like she was part of the 
d&#130;cor or a faceless servant taken for granted; however that the pretty 
plaything of Kaede&#39;s was here in any measure had Dominique&#39;s attention, 
small amount that it was. That Fumiko had lived through Noir&#39;s barrage 
of gunfire was a marvel in itself, but contrary to the drenching of 
dried blood over her clothes and more caked on her face and caught in 
her tangled hair, the young woman was astoundingly even without any 
injury. She sat demurely with her hands in her lap, unfazed by the 
jarring gory image she presented. She still even had her hat, its frayed 
bullet-ridden remains placed neatly beside her. It was too bad Fumiko 
hadn&#39;t been wearing it when those holes were created. Kaede could do far 
better than her.

&quot;Who were they?&quot;

Dominique rubbed her hand over Kaede&#39;s neck, letting the girl&#39;s 
heartbeat press rhythmically against it, and then kneaded the flesh 
between her fingers and palm. The child was awake, in the sense that she 
was liberated from her deranged torpor for the moment, judging by the 
steadiness of her voice. Dominique could always tell when it was the 
real Kaede speaking over the insanity that possessed her; there was a 
quality to her voice and gestures that harked back to her mother&#39;s 
strong and astute character. In these painfully ephemeral periods of 
lucidness Dominique wished Kaede would rethink her avid abstinence from 
drugs; there could be hope for her contained in a pill bottle somewhere, 
some medication to hold her from the edge of madness. The woman had 
tried talking her charge around to the benefits of modern medicine, but 
opposing Kaede too vigorously was a precarious undertaking, even for one 
as entrenched at her side as Dominique was. Kaede instinctively threw up 
resistance whenever pushed, and sooner or later resorted to violent 
means of defiance if continued to be harassed. The child&#39;s mind was a 
mercurial mess, yet changing it when set was almost impossible.  

Kaede&#39;s question came somewhat as a shock, but Dominique masked it 
effortlessly, carrying on massaging the girl&#39;s neck while chewing over 
how to answer her. The psychotic haze that had gripped Kaede during the 
gunfight had not been barrier enough for her attackers to escape memory, 
or for her to recognise they warranted singling out from the standard 
Soldats agents. It was not the mercy Dominique had sought. For a second 
she considered glossing over the details concerning the two assassins 
that had captured the girl&#39;s attention, but relented quickly. She kept 
things from Kaede when she had to, but it was not too early to reveal 
the existence, the *true* existence, of Noir the way Soldats knew it to 
the curious child. It was important for Kaede to understand the peril 
that Noir was, now that the maidens were apparently united with Soldats 
in an abomination against everything Altena had valiantly strived 
for--the peril that Noir was, and the holy avengers they were born to 
be.

Indeed, hiding Noir&#39;s significance might inflict the greater harm. 

&quot;They are the Black Hands of Soldats,&quot; Dominique narrated just above a 
murmur. Everybody in the sedan bar Kaede and Fumiko were aware of what 
Noir was, and with the latter woman&#39;s eavesdropping insignificant, 
talking quietly was unnecessary. However, speaking of the timeless 
killers invoked hushed reverence, obligatory and inevitable when the 
speaker *truly* knew them, as Dominique and her sisters did. Noir had 
appeared as enemies before her and her allies, but they were always 
worthy of honour and respect. &quot;For nearly as long as there has been 
Soldats, there has been those that carry out our--their--will with the 
sword. But they are greater than mere soldiers; more than simple 
murderers; and more divine than the most devout among us. Their kingdom 
is death, and they reign over it with an iron fist like no one else 
can.&quot;   

&quot;Tell me everything,&quot; Kaede said.

******

&quot;...was crazy! Like something out of a movie! I didn&#39;t know what was 
happening at first, then suddenly, &#39;boom&#39;! The loudest thing you can 
imagine! I ran.&quot;

&quot;It was terrible. I saw people running outside, and, ah, I thought it 
was a fire, maybe even just a drill, you know? Then those explosions. 
Those people.... It was terrible.&quot;

&quot;Where the hell are we, the Middle East? I&#39;m so sick of the damn yakuza 
bringing their feuds into the streets and getting innocent people 
involved. Some dumb gangster got himself shot near my apartment last 
week. I thought *that* was bad. The police have no control over 
organised crime in this city.&quot;

&quot;Witnesses had plenty to say, however the police have yet to comment on 
this morning&#39;s *incredible* violence that took place inside *and* 
outside Yohohama District Court. Speculation is rife on the perpetrators 
and the purp--&quot;

Mireille bent down and switched off the television set, shutting up the 
dramatic reporter, and tossed the remote that had gagged her back onto 
the kotatsu. She didn&#39;t want to hear about this morning right now. It 
had been far from Mireille and Kirika&#39;s slickest operation, but Soldats&#39; 
stunt had ensured an explosive and brazen finish to it. Breffort had 
promised her that it was Noir&#39;s show here in Japan....

She sighed grimly. Had she actually believed his word for even a second?

She should count her blessings--she and Kirika had gotten out cleanly; 
always a plus on any assignment. There were plenty of witnesses to 
Soldats&#39; interference, however no one had seen her or her partner&#39;s face 
to her knowledge; none that could link them to the shootings anyway, or 
who didn&#39;t already know what they looked like. And Yokohama&#39;s police 
could scour all the courthouse surveillance tapes for as many hours they 
wanted too; they wouldn&#39;t find the recordings starring their killers. 
Noir were as good as ghosts.

The situation had become too hot after Soldats had slapped Ishinomori&#39;s 
motorcade with a couple of rockets, shaking the streets and the Corsican 
assassin, and by the time the fire engines had started pulling up, 
Mireille had left the wail of their sirens far behind. There had been a 
tense few minutes of waiting at the train station for Kirika, each 
assassin taking their own unique route to the rendezvous point to 
disassociate themselves from one another in case of tails or onlookers, 
however the girl had wordlessly appeared beside her tousled but 
standing. There had been no reason to think her partner wouldn&#39;t 
otherwise, yet Mireille had felt the stress of the wait acutely before 
reuniting with Kirika. These days Kirika seemed all the more younger and 
vulnerable, and the danger Mireille put her in all the more menacing.

From there on out, Mireille and Kirika had travelled back to Kawasaki 
the way they had come; silently in each other&#39;s company. With a shared 
look both had told their respective tales in their longing eyes, of 
missed chances and narrow escapes; of hearts still beating that should 
have ceased... and the memory of their faraway home.

Kirika, kneeling on the floor, looked from the blank TV screen to 
Mireille. &quot;It&#39;ll rot your brain,&quot; the blonde quipped, pushing the first 
aid kit on the kotatsu closer to where her partner was and placing the 
small basin she had just filled with warm water next to it.

Kirika turned back to the television, warily inquisitive, as though it 
were a rattlesnake that had suddenly shaken its rattle. Mireille 
wondered what strange thoughts she had ignited in that mop-haired head. 
Kirika had a tendency to take things she said too seriously, or 
misunderstood them completely.

Mireille smirked wryly to herself. She supposed that was something of 
the girl&#39;s charm.

Mireille stood up and unbuttoned her lavender jacket and shook herself 
out of it, letting it drop off her arms onto the floor, and then pulled 
her shirt out of her skirt. Her pantyhose she had already removed 
immediately after returning to the Yuumura household--they were 
scrunched up in the kitchen&#39;s bin, streaked with runs, of course. 
Mireille had never worn a pair that hadn&#39;t become a casualty midway 
through an assignment; she much preferred the sturdier and less 
intrusive classier alternative of stockings with or without garters. The 
constrictive nylon trappings were the only option for hosiery as the hem 
of her skirt climbed, however.

The woman knelt beside the stubby table. &quot;Kirika,&quot; she beckoned.

Kirika dragged her bottom across the tatami mats with her arms until she 
was kneeling in front of Mireille. She was still dressed in her grey 
suit and her tights--and with not a single tear in the flimsy sheer 
material. If that wasn&#39;t testament to the girl&#39;s slick ability in combat 
she didn&#39;t know what was, Mireille thought dryly.

That said, even experts met with injury some of the time, and Kirika had 
seen a little roughing up during this morning&#39;s affair. It was nothing 
more serious than a bleeding nose, a few bumps and bruises, and a 
slightly grubby face, but Mireille felt it serious enough to merit her 
close attention. Needless, the woman&#39;s mind had spoke, a waste of time. 
Pointless mothering to a bloody nose already dried and bruises she could 
do nothing for, and dirt that the shower could and would better handle. 
Yet Mireille had still gone through the motions throughout the diatribe, 
preparing the water and fetching the medical supplies. There was such a 
thing as thinking too much.

Mireille undid the buttons closing Kirika&#39;s jacket and pushed it off her 
passive partner&#39;s shoulders, before taking it away and laying it on the 
kotatsu. She told herself it was for Kirika&#39;s comfort, or even to 
facilitate her ministrations. When she didn&#39;t think about it, it seemed 
plausible, and the only truth.

The blonde tugged loose the ribbon at Kirika&#39;s neck that held her tight 
collar together, and undid several buttons down her shirt, stopping 
before it felt as though she were undressing the girl. Mireille lightly 
soaked a cotton ball in antiseptic retrieved from the first aid kit, and 
wiped it under Kirika&#39;s nose, cleaning the small traces of crusted blood 
there. Warm water replaced the antiseptic after Mireille had swabbed 
what trifle facial wounds Kirika had, and the woman painstakingly washed 
her partner&#39;s soiled face with sodden cotton and tender rubs.

Kirika blinked lethargically under the care, shading reddish-brown eyes 
that grew glassier with every moment and loving wipe. Mireille cradled 
the girl&#39;s chin in her free hand to hold Kirika&#39;s slightly lolling head 
still, and smoothed the cotton wool along her jaw line that framed her 
cute face. The blonde had realised that her partner was cute the first 
time she had seen her picture on her laptop&#39;s screen so long ago, but up 
close it dawned on Mireille that she forgot that Kirika was 
exceptionally pretty.... Beautiful. Staring at her, looking past the 
youth, the docile nature and the na&#139;ve manner, the partner and the 
colleague, Mireille finally *saw* Kirika. *Truly* saw her, as the 
gorgeous young woman she was.

Mireille was attracted to the person Kirika was, not particularly to the 
girl&#39;s physical makeup. It was her personality she had first fallen for, 
her heart and soul and everything else inside that made Kirika, Kirika. 
On the outside Kirika had been simply &#39;cute&#39;; Mireille had been 
conscious of the fact her newly acquired partner wasn&#39;t ugly or 
unattractive, but it had been taken for granted, distant knowledge never 
genuinely explored. The girl&#39;s looks weren&#39;t the typical type to &#39;woo&#39; 
Mireille, or so the woman had believed at the time; for that matter, 
Kirika hadn&#39;t been her type in any shape or form whatsoever. Her type 
had habitually been beautiful mature and feminine women around her age 
or slightly older; independent women like she was, and sometimes even 
more strong-willed than her with a dash of overbearing. But had they 
made her happy? Had Mireille really known what she&#39;d wanted at all?

When she thought back to the days and nights of ephemeral relationships 
and no-strings encounters, Mireille didn&#39;t miss them and recognised that 
she had garnered nothing else but the physical solace from them. What 
she had with Kirika was so much deeper and more rewarding than the 
physical realm&#39;s fleeting delights and transitory connection; indeed, 
the two young women had yet to delve that domain to any real degree and 
still Mireille felt more fulfilled than she ever had with any 
acquaintance or outright stranger. Of course, she hadn&#39;t loved any of 
them.     

Mireille&#39;s desire for Kirika stemmed from her heart, but gazing upon the 
captivating visage before her, that desire unearthed a new font, though 
one equally laden with guilt and shame at its implications--perhaps even 
more so, being that much more base... more bodily. Nevertheless, the 
beauty persisted in front of her, tempting her, stirring her. The 
feelings were a sibling to those in her breast; they meshed together, 
different but part of the same, like the raging currents sweeping over 
the top of deep, still waters underneath. They fed off each other, 
stoking each other, the desire stronger with the love, and the love 
enriched by the desire. Glorious.... Without her rational mind telling 
her so, Mireille would have never known them reprehensible.

Mireille brushed her thumb across Kirika&#39;s cheek, just under the girl&#39;s 
partially lidded eye, taking away a stray droplet of water. A touch of 
makeup would look terrific on her; nothing too heavy that would cloud 
her already fine features, just a little to bring that innate beauty 
into clearer focus. Kirika&#39;s hair could be styled a bit too, or grown 
out; that look would be interesting to see. But the adjustments were 
absent-minded ideas, brought on by Mireille&#39;s own pursuit in cosmetics 
and fashion. If Kirika were to somehow be frozen in time just the way 
she was now, perfection would last forever in Mireille&#39;s eyes.

The cleaning, if that&#39;s what it still was, descended to Kirika&#39;s neck. 
The girl&#39;s eyes had closed, which was perhaps just as well as Mireille 
avidly watched warm water roll down the contours of her partner&#39;s neck 
to her chest, then dribble lower still. There were no bra straps on 
Kirika&#39;s shoulders, Mireille acutely observed inside her half-open 
shirt. That sort of thing simply wasn&#39;t proper; however objections were 
difficult to come by while Mireille sat staring.

Kirika&#39;s eyes inched slowly open, seizing Mireille&#39;s breath as the 
younger girl gazed back into the eyes that ravished her. What was going 
on in Kirika&#39;s head was a mystery as usual, but that mystery was a 
blessing right now. Or did Kirika even understand the heat she saw in 
her partner&#39;s gaze? That thought had Mireille feel even greater 
discomfort.   

The doorbell broke the tension, at least the tension building in 
Mireille, and it was with zest that she stood up to answer it. That 
enthusiasm dipped considerably when it occurred to her she and Kirika 
shouldn&#39;t be receiving visitors at the safehouse. A benign though 
grating solicitor waited behind the front door, or there lurked someone 
that knew who resided in this house--someone that Mireille might have to 
greet with her gun.

The door chimed again, summoning Mireille to hasten answering it. She 
quickly took off the harness holding her gun and its ammunition to her 
body and after drawing the Walther P99 from the holster, threw the 
leather straps out of sight. If it really was a door-to-door salesperson 
or the like, it would not do to spook them with the sight of the pistol 
harness, something usually only law enforcement wore.     

Her gun at her hip, Mireille opened the door a crack; half as far as the 
security chain allowed; ready for the police, an Ishinomori assassin, or 
any woman or man with a weapon. However her caution was unneeded, 
although her hostility might still be in order--it was Jacques on the 
doorstep.

Mireille lips twisted, but she undid the chain to let him in before 
walking away, leaving the man to see himself inside. Her frosty 
reception exposed her back to a Soldats lackey, but Kirika had him in 
her eye, alert and fully awake now--the blonde wasn&#39;t really exposed at 
all.    

&quot;I thought I&#39;d drop by,&quot; Jacques said as he shut and locked the front 
door and flicked off his shoes with his thumbs. &quot;Just to see that you&#39;d 
settled in.&quot;

&quot;How thoughtful,&quot; Mireille said, purposely as banal as the Soldats 
operative&#39;s explanation. Jacques had his briefcase, and he was Soldats; 
a social call was as far-flung as his homeland. The Corsican hadn&#39;t 
expected to see him ever again. &quot;But no housewarming present?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Jacques looked surprised for a second, the idiot taking Mireille 
too seriously, but collected himself while adjusting his trademark black 
sunglasses on his face. &quot;It... didn&#39;t go like we&#39;d foreseen,&quot; he said, 
discarding the congenial airs and getting down to the real reason for 
his visit. &quot;Plenty of collateral, yet none of the priority targets.&quot; He 
paused deliberately. &quot;Targets we wanted dead.&quot;

Mireille sat down beside Kirika, and laid her Walther P99 in front of 
her on the kotatsu. Since leaving the city she had been trying not to 
think about what had happened in Yokohama; trying not to let what little 
was accomplished and the subsequent second guessing that always cropped 
up sooner or later with assignments of a personal nature eat her up 
inside. Jacques&#39; appearance put an end to that, but she had to confront 
reality eventually. She just would have preferred if it had been on her 
terms, and especially not when she was valuing her privacy with her 
partner.   

&quot;I realise that,&quot; Mireille admitted acidly to the interloper. &quot;You saw 
fit to even try yourself with that ham-fisted attack. It wasn&#39;t a help 
and it wasn&#39;t the agreement.&quot;

&quot;That wasn&#39;t us,&quot; Jacques said, sitting down at the table, across from 
the blonde. He quietened for an instant, and Mireille mused whether 
behind his dark lenses he was gauging the open medical kit on the 
kotatsu and its implications. &quot;None of my employer&#39;s, at any rate. We 
would never be so public,&quot; Jacques went on, making no further indication 
that he saw the kit. &quot;Plus we keep our word.&quot; Mireille almost laughed at 
that one. Bitterly and on the inside, anyway. 

&quot;And besides, we know how capable you both are by yourselves. I mean, we 
*thought* you...&quot; Jacques trailed off for his own benefit, with the 
sense to appear uncomfortable. &quot;Alas, an opportunity I doubt we will get 
again has slipped through your--*our*--fingers,&quot; he continued somewhat 
more carefully, his diplomacy still shaky. &quot;They&#39;ll lock Kaede 
Ishinomori in that tower of hers for weeks and won&#39;t let her peek out a 
window even.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll take her there,&quot; Mireille said evenly. &quot;As soon as 
possible.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think *we* would have done that if we&#39;d assessed it 
feasible?&quot; Jacques argued. &quot;Not with all her allies. The level of 
security there is just--&quot; His voice raised and one hand swept across the 
table in exclamation; however he calmed when he realised his excitement. 
&quot;And it&#39;d be *worse* for you. They *know* you.... They all do.&quot;

Mireille looked away and chewed on her lower lip for a moment before 
restraining herself. She could feel Soldats&#39; grip tighten around her; 
suddenly feel the strings on her limbs that had always been there. It 
didn&#39;t unnerve her--it was too familiar to. But it did anger her.

&quot;You understand now why her empire, her supports, must be taken out 
piece by piece,&quot; the tool of Soldats spoke. &quot;If just to simply make 
Ishinomori vulnerable. But her hierarchy isn&#39;t strictly a pyramid; pop 
off the cap and the foundations crumble--every rebel beside her could be 
another Kaede Ishinomori should she die; another anarch for the zealots. 
Le Grand Retour...&quot; Jacques shook his head, looking down at the table. 
&quot;Na&#139;ve fools. The world became too complex for that.&quot;

&quot;Maybe they aren&#39;t completely wrong,&quot; Mireille said. She turned back to 
Jacques, staring directly at his sunglasses. &quot;I know the world would be 
a better place without *you*.&quot;

Jacques snorted. &quot;The world would be chaos without us. The peace we have 
now is as realistic as paradise gets. It&#39;s the people, you see. You 
should know this, in your line of work. Wherever there are people, there 
is conflict. It&#39;s human nature. And damned if I don&#39;t prefer it that 
way; I&#39;d rather be a brute than lobotomised like the Retour advocates.&quot;

Mireille smiled faintly; coldly. &quot;You&#39;re all the same to me.&quot;

Jacques smiled wanly back. He opened his briefcase, producing a dossier 
that he slid across the kotatsu to the blonde. &quot;Updated reports on our 
situation. With your stay indefinite, you&#39;ll need them.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Jacques frowned, confused. &quot;Trust me, the information inside is price--&quot;

Mireille looked at Kirika, who favoured the blonde with her deep soulful 
stare. &quot;No,&quot; the woman uttered again, holding her partner&#39;s look. &quot;We&#39;ve 
done enough. We attacked, we killed; it&#39;s enough.&quot; She took a breath and 
turned her head back to Jacques. &quot;We&#39;re going home.&quot;

It felt awkward as soon as Mireille announced it; going against her 
plans, her nature; her good sense. It was a spur of the moment decision 
determined by emotion; dangerous and not without its price; but what 
choice didn&#39;t have danger? There were *degrees* of risk, her rational 
mind advised, yet at that second logic seemed to demand unreasonable 
things from her. She was tired of being pulled where Soldats led; she 
was tired of Kirika being dragged along with her to share her fate. 
Mireille&#39;s instincts screamed at her; screamed about loose ends, 
vengeance for Paris, about the possibly fatal ramifications. But none of 
it seemed worth giving up the control over her life she had just 
reclaimed, nor did she deem that any of the consequences were 
insurmountable. She could only focus on her independence, and how it 
would bring her and Kirika home.

Kirika was giving Mireille a new look, obviously mildly taken aback by 
her partner&#39;s uncharacteristic &#39;retreat&#39; as it were; however the blonde 
was positive Jacques on the other hand couldn&#39;t interpret past the 
girl&#39;s stoicism, and moreover certainly not while wrapped up in his own 
much more flagrant show of shock.

&quot;It&#39;s *not* enough,&quot; Jacques spluttered, his eyebrows lifting above the 
upper rim of his shades and his hands slapped flat on the kotatsu, as 
though he were about to lift himself up too. &quot;Y-You&#39;re not serious, are 
you? My employer expects results, I mean, you can&#39;t just *leave* a job 
unfinished!&quot;

&quot;This was never a &#39;job&#39;. This was Soldats sticking their fingers in 
lives they should have known to leave alone.&quot; What would keep Breffort 
from insisting that the Soldats council still needed more proof of where 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s loyalties lay? Soldats would have Noir fighting 
their battles in Japan until there was no one left they wanted dead to 
kill, if they had their way. Instead of Altena pulling the Black Hands&#39; 
strings, it would be Breffort and his ilk. Noir had fought Soldats&#39; 
enemies; they had killed some. They had punished for the improper use of 
their mantle. In the eyes of reason, they had done enough. If Soldats 
wanted more, then their true intentions were beyond doubt... and there 
wasn&#39;t a chance Mireille would abide them.   

&quot;You must realise the consequences,&quot; Jacques persisted. &quot;You can&#39;t 
just-- just--! Not even *you* could hope to live longer than a month, 
two months, tops! Because that&#39;s how long you&#39;ll buy! You&#39;ll be on the 
run until they *choose* to erase you from their world!&quot; His protests 
were clearly heartfelt; Mireille wondered if he felt his own life would 
be at stake if she and Kirika left Japan permanently. But what he spoke 
of were still the same vague &#39;hammer of God&#39; threats Soldats were good 
for. Mireille had heard it all before, and from more powerful people 
than Jacques.

&quot;We&#39;re not a part of Soldats, and we never were,&quot; Mireille said. &quot;If 
they think to dispute that...&quot; She fingered her pistol. &quot;Then as you 
said, they&#39;ll know where to find us.&quot;

Jacques was shaking his head from side to side, gaping, and had started 
to perspire, a sheen developing across his forehead. &quot;You&#39;re smart,&quot; he 
croaked, rubbing his sweaty hands over his suit sleeves. &quot;Be smart about 
this. It&#39;s not just us, but Ishinomori too who&#39;ll be out for your blood. 
They know you just as we do. They&#39;ll come for you too, eventually. 
You....&quot;

He sighed heavily and stood up with his briefcase. &quot;It&#39;s not good that I 
come here too often,&quot; he muttered quickly. He kept his head down, 
avoiding looking at Mireille or Kirika. &quot;I&#39;ll send further updates via 
email. I&#39;ll see myself out.&quot;
 
Jacques strode to the genkan and hurriedly put on his shoes. He opened 
the front door, but stopped with it ajar and his hand on the handle. 
&quot;You are *them*... *Noir*,&quot; he breathed. &quot;You&#39;ll always be until you&#39;re 
both dead. You&#39;re part of this world, and Soldats...&quot; He exhaled slowly, 
and at length. &quot;Soldats *is* the world. That makes Soldats part of you. 
Each of us figures that out, soon enough.&quot; He stepped outside, shutting 
the door after he&#39;d gone.

Mireille looked at Kirika. The girl knelt there, unfazed. She&#39;d follow 
Mireille into hopeless odds if the woman asked. She&#39;d face the world 
itself in a violent opera sang with guns and in a bullet ballet danced 
by killers, as Mireille had considered herself once before when her 
young partner&#39;s life and heart had been at risk... when both of their 
lives and hearts had been at risk. However to face the world was no 
hyperbole; Soldats indeed was everywhere, rooted in every level of 
society and in every nation on earth. All death was certain sooner or 
later, by the bullet or the blade or blessed old age, yet openly calling 
down Soldats upon them was tantamount to suicide, or at best sentencing 
them to live a life even more constrained by peril than the one Mireille 
and Kirika lived now. In her pursuit of freedom, Mireille might instead 
throw away the cherished amount she and her partner had. 

******

There was history in every item; a unique history unheard of among the 
ranks of most scholars and historians, even the most learned and 
respected; a saga no less, stretching from the Dark Ages to this modern 
day and age. The privileged knew it in some shape or form; at least 
those who had been privileged for long enough; but people like Dominique 
and her sisters knew it better than anyone. It was people like her and 
her sisters who had recorded it.

This room was as close to the Manor as any in Dominique&#39;s fold could 
venture; this monument to an illustrious ideal that had rung around the 
world--would ring again. Encased behind glass were fraying tapestries, 
faded paintings, tattered books, discoloured weaponry, battered shields, 
decaying documents--rotting relics from time immemorial, and their worth 
far more than all the precious metals on earth combined. This room was 
an alien and ignoble resting place for them, but time had proved it 
could reach even a timeless place. Some had felt it blasphemy to remove 
the artifacts, however Dominique and others who had possessed the same 
fears and reverence as her had taken it upon themselves to save what 
they could from the Manor, smuggled out under Soldats&#39; noses at extreme 
risk. Who knew what the old men might have done, when they&#39;d had the 
gall to lay siege against that sacred ground&#39;s unswerving defenders? The 
Manor and its surrounding buildings and everything within could be 
pulled down to their foundations now, with the rubble collapsing and 
sealing off the subterranean levels, and nearby vineyards put to the 
torch and the blackened soil thereafter salted. Dominique had apologies 
for no one.

With the importance of the items inside, naturally the room was off 
limits to anybody who wasn&#39;t a sister, even Kaede, despite it being on 
the penthouse floor where she lived. The glories of Soldats, the *true* 
Soldats, and their holy warriors weren&#39;t for defiling by commoners&#39; 
eyes, of which there were regrettably many residing in or frequenting 
Ishinomori Tower. 

Dominique would never demean Kaede by lumping her in with the rest of 
the rabble-- namely her brother&#39;s ragtag group and Japan&#39;s criminal 
element that she&#39;d had no choice in allying herself with--she was 
certainly no commoner; she was a sister by her righteous deeds if not 
already by blood. Yet a sister in all but name was still not truly a 
sister. In another life she probably would have risen officially to the 
full title, following in her mother&#39;s footsteps, but in this one it was 
a loftier legacy that saw Kaede&#39;s informal early admittance to Soldats&#39; 
annals. The world didn&#39;t need another sister--it needed its champions.  

&quot;The world was in turmoil when Soldats was conceived,&quot; Dominique said, 
admiring her predecessors&#39; accomplishments with a fond smile as she 
walked between the rows of display cases. It was sunset, the flagging 
golden light filtering through the blinds painting each relic with a 
deserving hallowed aura. The woman enjoyed touring the room at this time 
of day just for that. She&#39;d wanted Kaede to experience the same sights, 
feel the same veneration, and as such had held off slaking the child&#39;s 
thirst for knowledge until now. Temperance and her charge was fickle and 
trying, however the feat was made significantly easier with Dominique&#39;s 
arm in a sling; Kaede&#39;s resultant sympathy and anxiety producing a girl 
more willing to listen, and accept.

&quot;War in every corner, famine, plague and persecution everywhere else. 
Religion had failed to unite, but rather was the cause of many of the 
troubles. We saw that kingdoms could not govern themselves without 
harming their neighbours, or their own people. We saw religion as an 
excuse for conflict. We saw wealth as the moral defiler.&quot; Dominique 
stopped where a painting hung, the dull oils depicting a short-haired 
weasel of a man peeking around behind a throne, whispering into the ear 
of a contemplative monarch resting his chin on his fist. But lurking 
behind both, in the shadows barely visible, was a face belonging to a 
third party. If the work had a title it was lost to the ages, but its 
meaning was obvious.  

&quot;And thus, someone had to govern *everything* as a whole, unbound from 
Rome&#39;s meddling and stifling edicts, and incorporeal, incorruptible, 
that not the sword or the pen or the coin could interfere. 
Benevolent--*supreme*.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard this story,&quot; Kaede said, making her own path through the 
display cases. She touched her hand to one glass pane housing stacks of 
parchment that declared secrets that could rewrite history books. 
Squeaks erupted as she walked onwards dragging her hand behind her on 
the glass. &quot;And I know how it ends.&quot;

Dominique smiled faintly, as a teacher would for a conscientious pupil. 
They&#39;d write their own story, rekindling the triumphs of the first. 
Their names would be remembered, and their achievements recorded in ink 
and paint and put on exhibition just as the successes of old were now 
around them. However, neither woman cared for fame or the past. It was 
vengeance that drove the change currently consuming Soldats--hatred and 
sorrow, raw and human. Change was a means to their end.     

&quot;Yes,&quot; Dominique acknowledged. &quot;Ideas can be incorruptible, however the 
people behind them....&quot; She combed her fingers down through her hair, 
and swept the long tresses back over her left shoulder. &quot;People 
disappoint.&quot;  

The French woman walked over to where a crude wooden mannequin stood; 
shielded by glass of course; dressed in familiar garb she had worn 
herself and still had in her possession. Robes of white under lilac and 
white over lilac again, gold trim and turned up cuffs and a lighter 
lavender scarf at the neck. It was present day&#39;s livery for the loyal, 
for the most pious, although it had evolved into this appearance at 
least a hundred years prior.      

&quot;There are always those that have to die for the greater good that they 
refuse to or are too blind to see. The knife in the dark did its job, 
but we needed something beyond the crude murderer. Killers as 
incorruptible as our ideals, yet who did not balk at debasing themselves 
with the sin they cleansed. Killers who bred such fear that the knife 
never need be drawn.

&quot;So it was that we grew hands. Black Hands. That was--is--their name. 
Noir.&quot; The rapture on her face was there before Dominique knew it, and 
in her eyes she saw the past as those sisters before her must have done, 
wonderful and full of promise--sublime. 

&quot;So they&#39;re French?&quot; Kaede gathered.

&quot;Not as a rule, but it&#39;s accepted the *vision* of Noir was first 
perceived in what would become France,&quot; Dominique said, the child&#39;s 
voice fetching her back to the present. &quot;I apologise but some details 
are sketchy despite our records, however where the first Noir was 
conceived there is no doubt.&quot; She flourished her good arm around at the 
artifacts about them. &quot;These items came from that place. The Manor. 
Ruins now, but back then it had been much more.

&quot;Other buildings sprung up around it as the need arose; living quarters, 
a grand arena. But the Manor was constant. Yet it hadn&#39;t made its start 
as a manor house; it had been a convent, founded in a remote and rather 
barren region at modern day France&#39;s border, but even there the wars 
reached. It tore at the hearts of the nuns dwelling there, and at their 
faith. Faith in God, and in Soldats, for every one of them believed in 
the ideal. They wept, they prayed. Finally, in their reverie, they saw 
what was needed. What the world needed.&quot;

Dominique moved to a tapestry, one of her favourites if not the most. It 
showed two women in flimsy robes wielding swords against a huge army, 
the soldiers, both on foot and mounted, decked out in plate and mail in 
clear weighted comparison. Hopeless odds, yet looking at it one felt the 
women would emerge victorious. 
  
&quot;The first were two women; an abandoned urchin and an orphaned noble 
girl. Why? Do not ask. Perhaps the convent also maintained an orphanage. 
Perhaps the sisters felt that women&#39;s hearts could feel the plight of 
the world more deeply. Whatever the reason, the Black Hands have 
traditionally been young women without parents. Saplings to be nurtured 
into strong trees. The sisters kept them, trained them, and the Mother 
Superior loved them. The girls would face scorn for their bloody role, 
lose their innocence, but in the Mother Superior&#39;s tender arms they 
could regain it time and again, murder after murder. The Kind Mother.&quot;

Dominique looked over to two crossed tarnished swords erected on a 
stand. The blades were straight, and long and slender. And still 
sharp--Dominique had retrieved them from the Manor herself.

&quot;Noir fought armies, or so it was written. Certainly their crusade slew 
several armies&#39; worth of men and women. When they fell another 
incarnation was reaped. Noir was immortal.&quot;

&quot;Why two?&quot; Kaede asked, stepping nearer to peer at the swords. &quot;Why not 
three then, or ten, or a whole army?&quot;

&quot;Why not? Two is better than one.&quot; Dominique sighed, realising she had 
dodged the question, and not nimbly.

&quot;But--&quot;

&quot;They had to be connected,&quot; Dominique revealed in a rush, wondering if 
this was the one secret that might have been better to keep from her 
charge. Too late to second guess now. &quot;It-- it was the key. The crucial 
thing that kept them pure in the darkness when the Kind Mother&#39;s 
affection was not enough. They had to care for each other; their hearts 
had to be connected. As friends, as siblings.... As lovers was best. 
With that link, they became an army unto themselves.&quot; Dominique was 
intimate with the strength love could muster. While the girl&#39;s 
understanding was different, she was positive Kaede knew as well.    

The room fell silent as its two visitors reflected on their respective 
understandings, and on the deeds they had yet to fully see through. Oh 
yes, Kaede knew.

Dominique cleared her throat. &quot;The sisters of the convent slowly... 
&#39;reworked&#39; their faith. Christian paraphernalia was replaced by weapons 
and other tools of battle, and with celebrations of their creation&#39;s 
exploits,&quot; she said, walking towards the centre display case. &quot;They&#39;d 
found something more reliable to believe in--&#39;Noir. This word designates 
since a distant epoch the name of destiny. The two virgins reign over 
death. The black hands protect the peace of the newly-born.&#39;&quot; She 
recited the passage in its native French, which Kaede should be familiar 
with on account of Dominique and Hikaru&#39;s hand in the girl&#39;s schooling. 
Dominique trusted she had stayed in practice.  

&quot;As quoted from Langonel&#39;s Manuscript,&quot; Dominique explained, standing 
next to the tome in its glass refuge. It lay on a reading pedestal, yet 
not open to any page. The enlightenment in its words was not for just 
anybody, not even among sisters. &quot;It chronicles much of Soldats history 
and beliefs, with detail given to Noir. It is right that we have it.&quot; 
Dominique hadn&#39;t entertained the thought of Ryosuke and his shifty, 
coarse partner succeeding in rescuing Langonel&#39;s Manuscript from 
Soldats&#39; clutches in Paris, however she wasn&#39;t about to complain about 
their stroke of luck.

&quot;I knew I had seen this symbol before, when Big Brother brought it back 
with him,&quot; Kaede said, staring at the book&#39;s cover where two maidens 
representing the Black Hands faced each other holding their swords. &quot;You 
wear it. You all do.&quot;

Dominique unconsciously touched the identical pin on her lapel. &quot;Yes. It 
sets us apart from what Soldats has become. Until recently there hasn&#39;t 
been a Noir for decades, by *their* decree, though the name has 
persisted. Oh budding killers would adopt the title, but none understood 
it or lived up to it.&quot;   

&quot;Mm... I&#39;d heard them spoken of, when I was younger,&quot; Kaede said. That 
meant during her original stint with the Kanagawa Kotetsu, when its 
founding leaders were still alive and she was merely another thug, 
though an especially pretty one, under their command. It turned 
Dominique&#39;s stomach to think about. She&#39;d had taken care of that group&#39;s 
bosses however, after Kaede had at last returned to her family home. 
Shedding yakuza ties wasn&#39;t like quitting a job, and Dominique was 
protective of Hikaru&#39;s only daughter. The fools left in the Kanagawa 
Kotetsu had even elected Kaede their new leader after the 
assassinations, although Dominique suspected Ryosuke had something to do 
with that. &quot;So does this mean Soldats has reconsidered the tradition?&quot;

&quot;I hope not, but I can&#39;t be sure,&quot; Dominique admitted, rubbing her 
temple briefly. &quot;They were so against it. However, the present Noir is 
unlike any preceding it, at least as far as the histories tell. Our 
order tried to revive the Black Hands, in the hopes they would help us 
purify the world of its mounting disease. Instead they turned against 
us, even killing the Kind Mother who had given birth to them.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d have to ask them. Despite what some of your bodyguard might 
boast, none of us who were at the Manor, where the rebellion took place, 
survived. But Soldats seemed to distance themselves from Noir afterward, 
and I had believed the maidens would return to being freelance killers, 
like so many with the name have lived.&quot; Dominique sighed. &quot;A wrong 
hypothesis apparently, and with a blood price.&quot;     

&quot;Freelance killers...&quot; Kaede murmured thoughtfully. &quot;So they kill for 
cash?&quot; The girl bit her bottom lip, and her habitual small smile grew 
wide, dangerously manic. &quot;Then *we* can buy them!&quot;

&quot;I... don&#39;t think...&quot; Dominique started, taken aback. Did she not 
understand the threat? &quot;They--&quot;

&quot;*We* can hire them and use them *against* Soldats! We just have to pay 
them more!&quot; Kaede exclaimed, wringing her hands excitedly. &quot;Yes, the 
world&#39;s greed will be their destruction! Set up a meeting. There must be 
a method for contacting them; something public to the right public.&quot;

&quot;My Lady, I must advise that this is...&quot; Foolish? Insanity? What could 
Dominique say that wasn&#39;t like putting out a fire with petrol?

&quot;*Do* it,&quot; Kaede snarled suddenly, baring her teeth, then just as 
swiftly was gleeful again. &quot;They&#39;ll accept. It&#39;s their destiny to fight 
for us, and for the *world*! They&#39;ll answer our call. If not for 
destiny, then for the currency they crave. If they don&#39;t...&quot; Kaede 
whirled around, looking at the display cases everywhere, &quot;...we&#39;ll 
string them up here. In this museum. The traitor Noir, come see, come 
all!&quot;

Dominique swallowed awkwardly. She could sense when Kaede&#39;s mind was 
set, and while bringing up her wounded arm again might cool the girl&#39;s 
passion a measure, it wouldn&#39;t sidetrack her. Yet the gears in the 
woman&#39;s mind were already turning, coming together to shape a schematic 
from improbability that would see the child&#39;s will be done.

&quot;As you say, my Lady.&quot;

******

The light from Mireille&#39;s laptop&#39;s screen illuminated the woman&#39;s 
absorbed features in the otherwise darkness of the bedroom, the pallid 
glow washing out her already fair complexion and hair and casting 
ghostly shadows on the closed curtains behind her. Sleep was elusive, 
her mind predictably too active, turning the pressing situation in her 
head and analysing all the angles, all the options, and where each might 
lead. Needless to say Mireille and Kirika&#39;s bags remained open and 
unpacked at the end of the bed, no attempt to leave the safehouse made 
just yet. But it meant nothing. 

Mireille had taken to sitting up and poking around the internet on her 
laptop instead of staring up into the night alone with her thoughts, 
hoping the diversion would settle her. It hadn&#39;t, the words and images 
on the screen going unread and unseen, but the blonde persisted in the 
fa&#135;ade anyway. Perhaps staring into the monitor&#39;s glare would come to 
tire her out enough so she would *have* to rest.

The motionless lump swelling the bed sheets next to Mireille resembled 
what she sought--Kirika slept soundly, her own personal troubles not so 
grave that she could not find peace--peace enough for a night&#39;s slumber 
at any rate. It could not be discounted though that Kirika had her 
sleeping aid beside her which seldom failed, even when it was wide awake 
and sitting up. Kirika still clung to Mireille, quenching her need for 
physical contact through draping an arm and leg around the older woman&#39;s 
near thigh and keeping her smaller body close. Mireille didn&#39;t mind of 
course; her only worries there were that she might rouse her partner 
from her pleasant dreams.

Such a vision lying adjacent to her should have been diversion aplenty 
for Mireille, but not tonight, not with this turmoil. Whatever the 
Corsican assassin decided would affect the girl next to her as well.

Mireille smiled crookedly down at her comatose partner. It was second 
nature to think of herself and Kirika as a whole, to consider the girl&#39;s 
concerns her own; so different from how the blonde had lived before. 
She&#39;d always been out for herself, only herself in mind for every 
decision, and if that was to the detriment of anyone else, so be it.

Mireille rested her head back, almost touching the curtains and the 
window behind them. She wondered what they&#39;d think of what she had 
become, of the person she had grown to be. Her mother and her father, 
and her brother. Would they be proud? Something told her she might not 
like the answer; she had become a killer after all, in spite of her 
parents&#39; sacrifice. But at least Mireille had her soul.

She didn&#39;t think about her family as much as she used to. Before the 
Manor, vengeance had kept their memory fresh, but now their faces, their 
scents, the sound of their voices, had dimmed. It was like Mireille was 
losing them all over again, however it was a peaceful passing, like 
their ashes were being scattered to the wind. Perhaps it was their time 
to go.   

Mireille sighed and pulled up her email account on her laptop to cease 
floundering inside the melancholic quagmire that was not much of an 
improvement over the anxiety preceding it. She routinely checked her 
account, purely out of habit since Noir hadn&#39;t been active in the 
criminal underworld in a business sense for some while. If there was 
longing masked behind habit, Mireille did not confront it.

Mireille tried not to read the email subjects as she went about 
nominating them for deletion--the next step in her routine--however one 
stuck in her gaze. It was from Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals. This one she 
had to read in its entirety.

&#39;Meeting&#39; was the subject, and upon opening the email a concise message 
following the subject&#39;s style was displayed--a time in the afternoon and 
under it a street address Mireille didn&#39;t recognise, but assumed was in 
Yokohama.  

The assassin&#39;s right index finger tapped rhythmically beside the 
laptop&#39;s touchpad. She could just ignore it and go back to Paris with 
Kirika. Ishinomori could very well be asking Noir to come to their own 
funeral, although they would discover laying the two young women to rest 
a costly and futile affair. Or Ishinomori could be calling for a truce, 
but that was probably the most optimistic view. A truce.... The idea 
angered Mireille, yet she was unsure why.

Mireille clicked back to her email&#39;s inbox, glaring unseeingly at the 
other messages beseeching her and Kirika to bring their talent to the 
senders&#39; respective causes. The jobs kept pouring in, day after day 
irrespective that there was no reply. What would she and Kirika be doing 
if they weren&#39;t here now? Lounging in Mireille&#39;s apartment, living each 
day together in peace and quiet as it came? Ideally, but unlikely. 
They&#39;d be involving themselves in other people&#39;s business, making other 
people&#39;s problems their own--making what was personal to their clients&#39; 
personal to Noir. And for no other loftier goal than the money they 
would be paid for their services. 

But Soldats was already personal. Ishinomori was already personal. Not 
specifically Kaede Ishinomori, but the people with her. Ryosuke and 
Vincent, for their actions in Paris... and the priestesses. The 
priestesses for... for *everything*. Jacques had said that any one of 
them could rise to be another Kaede Ishinomori, but what about another 
*Altena*? The priestesses had recognised Mireille in Yokohama 
Courthouse. They had been involved with her years ago, when she was a 
child; with Kirika nearly all the girl&#39;s life; with the creation of 
Noir... with the murder of the Bouquet family.

It kept coming back to that moment that had defined the rest of her 
life. Mireille could feel the emotions building in her heart, reigniting 
after a long low simmer, threatening patient reason and detached 
consideration. She could let it go if she wanted. Let *them* go; let the 
wind carry them away once and for all. Simply pack her and Kirika&#39;s bags 
and leave, and deal with the repercussions no matter how fierce and 
colossal. They&#39;d survive, hiding somewhere remote, living below even 
Soldats&#39; radar. Mireille had the money and the means. It wouldn&#39;t be a 
bad existence, and they&#39;d have each other. Yet....

The tune from her father&#39;s smashed and discarded pocketwatch played in 
Mireille&#39;s head, haunting her. She had thought it was over. She had been 
ready for it to be. She had been deluding herself--it wasn&#39;t over. Would 
it ever be, until Soldats was no more? Maybe not Soldats, but Altena&#39;s 
enclave would be enough. It had to be. Mireille knew she couldn&#39;t move 
on while they still lived, while there was any *shred* of that evil 
woman left. They were more than loose ends to be tied out of prudence; 
on some level their deaths were *desired*. Not for Soldats, not for 
Breffort--but for Mireille&#39;s family, for herself, and for Kirika. For 
what those women and the one they had followed had done to two 
children&#39;s lives, and could do again if the fanatical whim took them. 
For the closure of this chapter of Mireille and Kirika&#39;s lives, and 
freedom forever from their haunted pasts. For *revenge*.

Mireille made a mental note of the meeting time and place, and closed 
her laptop, sliding it away under the bed. The bags would stay unpacked, 
the job offers unanswered. When Mireille&#39;s head touched the pillow and 
she closed her eyes, sleep came quickly.
