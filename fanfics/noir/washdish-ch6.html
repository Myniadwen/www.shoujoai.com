park and didn&#39;t see you.&quot;

&quot;I went and got these for you.&quot; I hand her a small iris bouquet.

&quot;Oh...&quot; her mouth opens and the word barely escapes. I blush a little as 
she takes them from my hand.

Flirting. I remember what he said. He&#39;s older, he must know these 
things. I do feel better after talking to him. He asked me to call him 
Uncle. I told him I would think about it. It would be nice to have an 
Uncle, even if it&#39;s one that might kill you one day. Or one you might 
kill, as Mireille had killed hers...

&quot;Kirika, thank you.&quot; she says softly, breaking into my train of thought. 
I watch her take the flowers into the kitchen, and hear her rummaging 
about for a vase. I breathe a sigh of relief.

Uncle said he was glad I was involved with my &quot;Mireille project&quot; as he 
called it- it meant Soldats had less to worry about Noir. I find I&#39;m 
glad too, and feel myself smiling.

&quot;Mireille darling, do open up! It&#39;s Anton!&quot; a voice booms from outside 
the door, followed by knocking.

I go to the door, shaking my head. Anton...

&quot;There- oh hello, little bit!&quot; he gives me an enthusiastic hug. &quot;Ready 
to go to the carnival?&quot;

&quot;Carnival?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to the carnival this evening. It will be fun.&quot; Mireille 
comes back into the room, smiling. She sets the vase on the table.

&quot;Well now, what&#39;s this? Another bloke giving you flowers?&quot; Anton walks 
over to the table and picks up the vase, eyebrows arched. &quot;Do I have 
competition?&quot;

&quot;Kirika gave those to me.&quot; Mireille says evenly. I watch his puzzled 
expression as she goes past him to get her purse. &quot;Let&#39;s go, shall we?&quot;</pre>
