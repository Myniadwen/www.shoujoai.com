First Contact


Mireille picked up her strawberry flavoured club soda and took a long 
draft from it through the black plastic straw resting against the 
glass&#39;s rim, next to where the slices of lemon and lime were wedged 
solely for aesthetic reasons rather than for enhancing the taste of the 
drink. She was sitting at the bar in a small ritzy cocktail lounge found 
in Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental in Paris&#39; 9th district, simply 
nursing her drink, as she had been doing for the last two hours. The 
greying bartender didn&#39;t seem to mind, though, appearing to be wholly 
occupied with polishing glasses and generally looking bored. That was, 
when he wasn&#39;t ogling Mireille appreciatively out of the corner of his 
eye or fixing her a fresh drink. He had attempted to engage her in 
conversation a couple of times, but Mireille was not one for idle small 
talk with strangers, even if the stranger happened to be a bartender 
with a sympathetic ear. Moreover, Mireille was playing the waiting game, 
an inevitable part of being a professional assassin, and it required all 
of her attention. Sometimes the woman found such a task wearying on her 
mind... but patience brought safety and efficiency.

It was late morning, and the lounge was understandably nearly empty of 
patrons, save for a trio of men in business suits sipping mineral waters 
while they chatted quietly amongst themselves, apparently going over the 
several documents that were spread out on the dark, buffed wooden 
surface of the circular table they were seated around. But that was one 
of the main reasons why Mireille had chosen this place to wait, or 
rather, spy from. That, and because the cocktail lounge opened out into 
the busy lobby of Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental, acting as a tranquil 
cove in a roiling sea of bustling people, and consequently providing a 
relatively clear view of the comings and goings of all the hotel&#39;s 
visitors; guests and otherwise. However, the blonde was only interested 
in two particular guests... two very dangerous guests.

Simon had emailed Mireille earlier in the morning with the information 
on Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu she had requested of him, one full 
day after she and Kirika had visited the uncouth hacker to make use of 
his talents. Mireille dreaded having to go back to the hormonal teen&#39;s 
basement hideaway to pay him the rest of his due fee, but for the moment 
that was the last thing on her mind. Through his meticulous--and 
illegal--scouring of every five star lodging&#39;s guest list across the 
city of Paris, Simon had discovered that Ryosuke and Vincent were 
staying at this very place, Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental, a quite 
lavish hotel that catered to prestigious clientele ranging from foreign 
diplomats to wealthy and distinguished overseas visitors; the majority 
of which having ties to prominent corporations. Kaede Ishinomori clearly 
preferred her older brother and his companion to reside in the lap of 
luxury whilst away from Japan.

Mireille had phoned the hotel from her apartment to check if Ryosuke and 
Vincent were within their suite before coming to the building with 
Kirika, but the member of staff she had spoken to informed her that the 
pair were not answering their telephone--they were seemingly out for the 
morning and he didn&#39;t know when they would return. That had been fine 
with Mireille, however. It gave her and Kirika the chance to visually 
confirm that the two men were in fact the ones they were looking for 
before committing themselves to some sort of decisive action, for 
instance laying in wait in their quarry&#39;s alleged room to ambush them, 
as the Corsican assassin had been tempted to do. Thus, here Mireille 
was, seated on a bar stool and sampling her fourth club soda of the 
morning, while patiently staking out the hotel&#39;s lobby.

Mireille replaced her half-finished drink on the bar beside her handbag, 
where it rested with its deadly payload contained inside, and looked up 
into the wide mirror mounted on the dusky wood wall panels on the other 
side of the bar, behind a series of shelves lined with bottles of 
expensive liquor and other potent yet pricey alcoholic beverages. The 
angle of the mirror bestowed the woman with a more or less unrestricted 
line of sight through the milling guests in the foyer--some of whom 
accompanied by bellhops wheeling brass luggage carts back and forth--to 
the hotel&#39;s front entrance, allowing her to monitor the throngs of 
people who entered the building, and to verify if Ryosuke and Vincent 
were among them. The position of the bar also meant that Mireille&#39;s back 
was facing the main entrance, offering her some welcome concealment from 
Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s eyes when they happened by while still letting her 
perform her surveillance. The blonde wasn&#39;t sure whether or not the duo 
was aware of her and Kirika&#39;s true identity as once being the genuine 
Noir, or what they looked like even if the men were aware, but she 
wasn&#39;t taking any chances.

Mireille shifted her wary blue gaze to the reflection in the mirror of 
the small group of men dressed in bland suits of three different shades 
of grey respectively sitting at the table a few feet to her rear. They 
looked like typical corporate slaves, their lacklustre ties hanging like 
nooses around their necks. Nevertheless, the assassin tired to look 
beyond the men&#39;s mediocre exteriors, noting their mannerisms and exactly 
how attentive they really were to the papers laid out before them on 
their table. While Mireille didn&#39;t truly expect any Soldats minions to 
be involved with watching Ryosuke and Vincent anymore after she and 
Kirika had agreed to assist Breffort--if the man&#39;s words could be 
trusted by even the slightest degree--it would simply be foolish to 
ignore her surroundings just because she was looking out solely for two 
specific individuals. Still, despite Breffort&#39;s assurances that there 
would be no support from him to aid Mireille and Kirika in their mission 
to deal with Kaede&#39;s false Noir beyond intelligence, it did not rule out 
the possibility that agents loyal to the high-ranking Soldats member 
could be observing the Corsican and her Japanese counterpart without 
their knowledge. Certainly, Mireille wouldn&#39;t put it past Breffort to 
keep an eye on his little &#39;investment&#39;. The prospect made her somewhat 
edgy. It would be best not to think about it--it might facilitate to 
relax her already stressed nerves--but unfortunately that wasn&#39;t an 
option for Mireille. She had to stay sharp; her and Kirika&#39;s 
confidential benefactor could be just as dangerous as Kaede&#39;s Black 
Hands...if not more so.

Mireille&#39;s eyes unconsciously drifted away from the cluster of men and 
up to the image of her diminutive partner near the top of mirror, as if 
they were inescapably attracted to it like a moth to flame. Kirika was 
sitting alone in a corner booth at the back of the cocktail lounge with 
a glass of barely touched orange juice on the table in front of her. 
Mireille had instructed the darkhaired girl to situate herself there, as 
it would permit her to survey the rest of the hotel&#39;s lobby that was out 
of the Corsican&#39;s field of vision; the section stretching from the 
middle of foyer all the way to the front desk and the concierge&#39;s desk a 
few feet to the left of it. Between the two of them they had maximum 
coverage of Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental&#39;s lobby, and in turn 
virtually all of the ground-level entryways into the hotel. They would 
not let Ryosuke and Vincent slip by them.

But Mireille had not separated from Kirika purely for that reason. It 
was also another defence against the likelihood that Ryosuke and Vincent 
knew of their identity. If they did, then they would no doubt be on 
guard for two young women travelling together--not alone. It was a 
trifling precaution in retrospect, but every little bit that would mask 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s presence from their targets&#39; view helped to 
bolster the pair&#39;s sense of security... well, in the Corsican&#39;s case at 
any rate.

Mireille released a soft breath as she saw Kirika&#39;s eyes once again 
negligently turn astray from the hotel lobby and focus on her instead. 
That had to be the twentieth time now, the blonde thought with some 
exasperation. The quiet girl had been alternating between scrutinising 
the lobby--like she was *supposed* to be doing--and staring at 
Mireille&#39;s back for most of the time they had been here. Her wavering 
focus was starting to chafe the woman&#39;s nerves, more so than they 
already were. Kirika was always meant to watch her back--it went without 
saying--but not literally... at least not in this instance, anyway.

Kirika hadn&#39;t been very amiable to the idea of splitting up when 
Mireille had introduced it to her. While the introverted girl had 
outwardly appeared her customary reserved self, inwardly Mireille had 
been able to tell that she was not content with the situation. But it 
had mattered not. It was unavoidable; safety came first. In actual fact 
Mireille wouldn&#39;t have minded Kirika to be sitting on a barstool by her 
side at this very moment. But that was a self-centred desire, one that 
stemmed from her heart, and it had no room in the mindset of an 
assassin.

Mireille crossed her legs and retrieved her half-full club soda from the 
bar in one hand, at the same moment she dropped her gaze from the 
reflection of her partner in the mirror, now only able to make out the 
petite form on the very edge of her vision. In truth, Mireille herself 
shouldn&#39;t be affording Kirika so much of her own attention either. But 
for some reason she couldn&#39;t seem to help it. She knew why, of course. 
She wasn&#39;t that self-deluding. But she favoured not to address the 
reasons why, not directly in any event. It was best not to. Not now, not 
when she was on an exceedingly important and indisputably soon to be 
perilous assignment with her counterpart. Mireille couldn&#39;t let those 
kinds of thoughts cloud her mind. She needed to concentrate on the 
mission.

Nevertheless, Mireille&#39;s thoughts quickly strayed to Kirika despite 
her--admittedly rather half-hearted--efforts to the contrary. Or more 
accurately, strayed to the memories of her and Kirika&#39;s final peaceful 
time together spent the day before yesterday, a last farewell to living 
in the light of the world before returning to the dark. The pair had had 
lunch together in Kirika&#39;s favourite caf&eacute; as promised after their 
meeting with Simon in his basement abode, and later during the evening 
they&#39;d had a quiet candlelit dinner in a low lighted restaurant situated 
in the vicinity of the Seine River. Mireille had enjoyed both meals 
immensely, but there had been an unspoken subdued air cloistering the 
pleasurable atmosphere that would have otherwise enveloped them 
comfortingly in its pleasant embrace, allowing them to forget what path 
lay ahead for a time and instead simply relish the here and now.

But there could be no forgetting. Indeed, the precise knowledge of 
exactly what dark path lay ahead of them had caused Mireille and 
Kirika&#39;s last peaceful outing to be hampered by bleak thoughts and 
little conversation, especially on the lithe girl&#39;s part. It was as if 
growth in Mireille and Kirika&#39;s relationship was proceeding in reverse 
now, slowly but surely shrivelling, the expansive wall of silence 
intermingled with detachment that had existed once before between the 
two rebuilding itself gradually brick by brick. Kirika was starting to 
clam up again, hardly even voicing so much as a hint of what was on her 
mind anymore--whatever progress Mireille had made with drawing the girl 
out of her shell was deteriorating bit by bit in concord with the 
reconstructing wall. The woman had tried to rekindle the usual ambiance 
between herself and her partner, but all her labours had fallen flat, 
met with only an absent nod or restrained mumble. It was frustrating and 
at the same time disheartening. Mireille wasn&#39;t sure what to do... 
except carry out Breffort&#39;s assignment. She hoped that after Kaede&#39;s 
false Noir had departed from this world--their passage hastened by her 
and Kirika&#39;s hands--that everything would return to the way it had been 
before. Mireille didn&#39;t want to think what she would do if she and her 
diffident counterpart failed to fully recapture their slightly more than 
friendly appreciation of one another.

Mireille took a deep swig of her soda--not even bothering to use the 
straw--tilting her head back and swallowing a series of mouthfuls of the 
sweet beverage in quick succession, polishing off her drink. She put 
down her now empty glass on the bar with a disenchanted sigh, the pillar 
of ice cubes remaining inside emitting a faint clinking noise. She 
wished she had been quaffing something with more kick, no matter the 
time of day--a vodka and lemonade for instance, or at the very least a 
white wine. Basically anything that would help to loosen the tension in 
her muscles and alleviate the strain on her mind.

Mireille sighed once more. She didn&#39;t need the mirror to know that 
Kirika was still looking in her direction; she could practically feel 
the darkhaired girl&#39;s eyes roving her back. Mireille was starting to 
think that Kirika had become too adjusted to the quiet life, in spite of 
her prior performance in their sewer tunnel shooting range the day 
before last. Neither of them could afford to get sloppy, especially now. 
Kirika&#39;s discontent on the state of affairs would just have to be 
ignored for the time being. Still, a part of Mireille wondered if 
becoming accustomed to a lifestyle free of violence and death was such a 
bad thing.

******

Kirika was seated sedately on the curved, lush couch of a snug booth in 
the corner of Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental&#39;s cosy lobby cocktail 
lounge, her waiflike frame dwarfed by the large compartment enclosing 
her, further emphasised by they way she sank into its puffy 
burgundy-coloured cushions. A tall, slender glass of freshly squeezed 
orange juice sat in front of her on a small round table. It tasted good 
and was refreshing, but Kirika had hardly taken more than a few sips. 
She didn&#39;t have much of a thirst this morning. But she supposed that 
wasn&#39;t very surprising, all things considered. This was it. The hunt--it 
had begun. And soon after, so would the violence. And the killing.

While a part of Kirika was dreading her and Mireille&#39;s impending 
showdown with Ryosuke and Vincent, another part of her was eager to get 
it over with as quickly as possible, almost fervently so. She wanted her 
and her partner&#39;s return to a life of murder to be but the briefest of 
tastes, a mere brush of bloodshed. Truly, it should be a simple brush. 
Two bullets fired for two lives taken. Just two. It would not only be 
efficient, but it would be exceptionally swift. What was one or two 
shots fired from her gun, after all? What was the blood of one or two 
more people on her hands? One or two more sins added to the long list 
already scrawled in black under her name? What difference would those 
minor misdeeds compared to the weight of her countless other crimes make 
in her struggle for her very being against the dark, heartless presence 
that skulked inside of herself? In all honesty, did any of it really 
matter in the slightest after all the atrocities she had done during her 
years of life?

Kirika eyelids suddenly grew heavy, her gentle brown eyes turning even 
more sombre than normal. Yes, it did. It mattered to *her*. And for that 
precise reason it mattered to the darkness also. Kirika had read once 
that violence begets violence, and her darkness thrived on it in a 
similar fashion. Any form or degree of violent behaviour on Kirika&#39;s 
part would foster its emergence on the surface of her heart and mind, 
enticing it ever more to engulf the girl and take her body as its own 
vessel of destruction. It was something Kirika must prevent from 
happening at all costs. If her will was overpowered, all of her qualms 
about killing would vanish like snuffed candlelight, and the slayings 
that would be committed with her as a powerless puppet would most likely 
be considerable and horrific. And Mireille would be placed in danger 
too. No, Kirika *must* remain steadfast; her determination to stay in 
control must never falter. And certainly not now, not when she would 
once again be entering a life where ending them was a common occurrence.

Kirika&#39;s solemn but alert gaze wandered away from the far end of the 
hotel&#39;s lobby that she was meant to be watching for any signs of the 
false Noir, and focused on Mireille&#39;s back instead, only the slim 
woman&#39;s rear visible to her from where the blonde was seated at the bar. 
Kirika knew she should be assiduous to her assigned duty--she and 
Mireille were hunting formidable foes, after all--but her eyes just 
weren&#39;t able to stay fixed on one spot for more than a handful of 
minutes without returning to the sight of her older partner, hunched 
slightly over her drink with her striking but dour blue gaze lowered to 
the bar&#39;s surface.

Kirika watched Mireille impassively as the woman lifted her drink to her 
mouth and tilted back her head, draining what remained of the beverage 
in a small number of abrupt mouthfuls, before she resumed her former 
despondent posture on her barstool. Mireille didn&#39;t look to be in very 
good spirits. Her slouched bearing gave off a nearly visible aura of 
gloom to Kirika, and what the girl could make out of her expression in 
the mirror on the other side of the bar was positively grim. And cold.

Kirika&#39;s own shoulders slumped dejectedly, as if a sudden weight had 
been draped around them, matching her partner&#39;s own. She wondered how 
Mireille felt about the change in their lives, or more accurately the 
imminent change. Would she miss the peace that had existed in their 
daily lives? Would she miss living each day as an average person would, 
void of atrocious violence and vicious murder? Initially Kirika had 
believed so, but now she wasn&#39;t so sure. She had thought Mireille had 
liked living a simple life with her, a normal lifestyle, but in 
hindsight she had just been hoping as much. Certainly Mireille appeared 
to enjoy the peace, but Kirika had seen her when she checked her email 
for new contracts on her computer. The woman&#39;s visage had always 
looked... patient, and yet somewhat forlorn, too. Mireille didn&#39;t 
possess the same misgivings about being an assassin--a killer--as Kirika 
did. The blonde had just abstained from performing such nefarious deeds 
for her sake, while she recovered from her injuries received at the 
Manor and, unknowingly to Mireille, from the psychological trauma of 
losing herself to the darkness. The first weeks back in Paris had been 
difficult for Kirika, but knowing that Mireille felt the same way about 
her as she did for the woman had aided in lessening the impact of having 
regressed to the sinister persona that had ruled her for most of her 
young life.

But now that recuperation period was over--Kirika&#39;s mind and body had 
mended all but fully. Kirika no longer needed to be coddled. And with 
the emergence of another potential enemy--originating once again from 
Soldats no less--it was a harsh prompt to return to their previous way 
of life; the life of murderers. Already Mireille seemed to be lapsing 
back into her old manner.

Yesterday and for half the day before Kirika had spent all of her time 
with Mireille, doing activities they had normally indulged in after 
returning home to Paris; ones that ordinary people do and take for 
granted. But while they had all been pleasant and enjoyable--all time 
spent with Mireille was--Kirika had sensed that the woman was a little 
distracted, distant even, her customary mask of aloofness slipping over 
her features slightly and furthermore affecting her behaviour. Her 
partner&#39;s detached mood had impinged on Kirika&#39;s own, smothering it 
until the quiet girl could scarcely raise her head or utter more than 
two words. As a result, a damper had been put on the general atmosphere 
between her and Mireille; one Kirika had been acutely aware of and still 
was.

Kirika&#39;s saddened brown eyes fell away from Mireille to the tabletop 
where her orange juice sat, observing the trickles of condensation roll 
down the outside of the clear glass to pool around its base. She 
wondered if Mireille actually liked the life of a professional killer... 
and if the woman liked it more than a peaceful life with her.

Suddenly Kirika felt very lonely sitting in the corner booth all by 
herself. It no longer seemed cosy, but rather stifling. Picking up her 
still near full glass of juice, Kirika guzzled down the cool liquid in 
rapid gulps, consuming the drink completely... and giving her an excuse 
to leave her post to seek another from the bar, where a certain blonde 
woman was currently seated.

Kirika scooted out from the booth and, with her empty glass in hand, 
approached the cocktail lounge&#39;s bar. Mireille&#39;s head moved a margin at 
Kirika&#39;s movement, and her shoulders tensed a little, but otherwise the 
blonde did not react, not even to the girl&#39;s proximity when she stood 
adjacent to her, closer than a mere stranger would, as they were 
expected to be.

Kirika placed her glass on the bar and motioned to the lethargic 
bartender to get his attention, her bare arm almost brushing Mireille&#39;s 
equally uncovered one with the action, the minute, imperceptible hairs 
on their skin catching each other&#39;s and causing an electric sensation.

Mireille shifted her weight on her stool and edged a fraction away from 
Kirika before resettling herself, still not looking in the darkhaired 
girl&#39;s direction.

Kirika ordered another fruit juice; a pineapple one this time. As the 
bartender shuffled behind the bar, busying himself with fetching her 
drink--and in obviously no hurry--Kirika turned to Mireille, actually 
glad that the man&#39;s laziness would give her a chance to perhaps speak to 
her partner for a moment or two.

&quot;Mirei--&quot; she started, but to her surprise, was immediately cut off by 
the blonde assassin.

&quot;You&#39;re rusty,&quot; Mireille said in a low murmur--her lips barely 
moving--while she used her straw grasped delicately in between her thumb 
and forefinger to idly swirl around the remains of the melting ice cubes 
in her glass in front of her. But Kirika heard the words perfectly--loud 
as if the woman were shouting them and clear as if she had articulated 
every syllable. And they cut like a knife.

Kirika closed her mouth and her head sank, suddenly having trouble 
keeping her chin up. She was thankful when her pineapple juice was ready 
in the subsequent minute; it meant she could go back to her seat and 
escape the upsetting situation she had naively walked into. After paying 
for the beverage with some of the money Mireille had given her for that 
specific purpose, Kirika returned with it and crestfallen steps to the 
sanctuary of the booth.

Maybe it was in Mireille&#39;s very nature to be an assassin, a part of who 
she was. Maybe it was in Kirika&#39;s too. But the girl certainly didn&#39;t 
feel that it was, despite the lethal skills she possessed. Perhaps the 
notion of a quiet, peaceful life for the rest of her and her partner&#39;s 
days had been but a fantasy. Nevertheless, whatever Mireille&#39;s outlook 
of the future, Kirika would respect it and the blonde assassin&#39;s wishes 
and stick by her no matter what. Mireille was the woman she loved; she 
could *not* and would *not* be parted from her, not again, even if it 
meant living a life bloated and corrupt with sin.

Still.... Kirika hoped that Ryosuke and Vincent would show up soon.

******

Mireille stared hard into her glass as she stirred the now deformed ice 
cubes inside with her straw, the blocks slowly liquefying in the 
temperature of the lounge. She looked at the thawing remnants of the ice 
cubes and the shallow pool of water they dwelled in as if the sight held 
the answers to all of the mysteries of the universe. Or at the very 
least, the knowledge of how to properly handle Kirika.

Mireille scowled in irritation, her annoyance directed squarely at 
herself. She shouldn&#39;t have been so abrasive to Kirika, even if the girl 
did seem to be somewhat out of form. But in this unforgiving business, 
it was better if one put their personal feelings aside until an 
assignment was finished. A soft heart had no place on the black path. 
But even so, Mireille could have at least paid for Kirika&#39;s drink--just 
a small gesture to appease the girl and silently indicate that she was 
aware of and sympathised with her apprehension regarding their 
transition from the light to the dark.

Just as Mireille was debating whether or not she should throw caution 
into the wind and take a breather from surveying the front part of the 
hotel&#39;s lobby to join Kirika, even if for but a moment--she was looking 
quite downcast sitting all alone in the corner of the lounge, more so 
than normal--in the reflection of the wall mirror the woman spotted 
their targets finally returning to Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental.

While looking much like they had in their photos included in Breffort&#39;s 
intelligence report, Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu both entered the 
hotel&#39;s foyer in entirely dissimilar manners. Ryosuke strode into the 
building with long, sure strides as was befitting a man of his tall 
physique, dressed almost exactly how he had appeared in each and every 
surveillance snapshot Mireille had studied diligently the day before 
last. Oddly, in spite of his brisk movement, the broad twin tails of the 
man&#39;s jet-black coat did not flutter or even so much as quiver in the 
slightest. Instead the entire glossy garment hung rigidly on his slender 
frame, all but totally immobile. It made for a peculiar spectacle.

Conversely, Vincent practically waltzed into Le Grand Hotel 
Inter-Continental with a swaggering gait and his hands stuffed in his 
pants&#39; pockets, smiling brightly, and shamelessly turning his head to 
follow the path of every pretty woman who walked by, his smile widening 
and becoming all the more dazzling in relation to the passer-by&#39;s level 
of beauty. Whereas his companion nearly resembled all of his photographs 
down to a tee, Vincent did apparently have a fashion sense beyond the 
lone colour black. Garbed in a dark purple suit, a lavender satin shirt, 
and a pale yellow tie decorated with a black, spiralling pattern, 
Vincent&#39;s flashy exterior and flamboyant demeanour certainly drew one&#39;s 
eye, be it appreciative or appalled. The majority of the admiring gazes 
originated from the female onlookers, and Mireille had no doubt that the 
fair skinned man&#39;s gorgeous looks had more than a little something to do 
with that.

The flocks of people rushing around the foyer parted before Ryosuke and 
Vincent, either intimidated by the statuesque white-haired and 
black-clad hitman, or in an effort to shun his garishly clothed and 
showy partner. Or perhaps a combination of the two. However, Mireille 
was another case completely. She and her own partner had a job to do and 
an urgent objective to accomplish, the result of the latter shaping how 
their lives would be lived for the foreseeable future. Mireille 
earnestly prayed that everything would go smoothly... for Kirika&#39;s sake.

Mireille grabbed her handbag from the bar and then slid off her stool to 
the floor, before casually yet smartly making her way out of the 
cocktail lounge, her high-heeled boots clicking sharply with her hurried 
pace. Her blue gaze snapped to her right to ensure that Kirika was 
moving too--the girl had to have noticed Ryosuke and his comrade&#39;s 
arrival, even if she was somewhat distracted--and after confirming that 
fact to be true, she began to tail the false Noir, making sure that she 
kept a prudent distance between herself and her prey, along with a 
screen of flowing people for additional protection. Kirika would be 
traversing her own route after the two men separate from Mireille--the 
blonde had thought it wise to maintain the charade of being strangers to 
one another until the hostilities started; at that point there would be 
no question that they were affiliated.

Mireille lost Kirika in the crowd while she kept her attention on their 
targets, but she was not worried. They had a plan, after all. The 
Corsican paused nonchalantly by a vacant payphone at the same time 
Ryosuke and Vincent stopped at the hotel&#39;s front desk. The Chinese man 
chatted sociably to the female receptionist there for a couple of 
minutes--saying something that made her noticeably blush and smile 
prettily--before the pair set off once again, this time heading for the 
row of silver elevators inlaid in a brass-coloured solid marble wall 
festooned with chaotic whorls of white, black and grey engrained within 
the stone.

Mireille resumed shadowing Kaede&#39;s Black Hands at the same instant the 
men themselves started moving again, weaving gracefully amid lavishly 
dressed guests and crisply uniformed staff alike, carefully making 
certain to have significant cover in the form of people in the event 
Ryosuke or Vincent happened to look over their shoulders. She saw the 
duo step into one empty elevator, closing the shiny doors quickly to 
block out any others from riding it. They must like their privacy.

Mireille took a second to look up at the elevator&#39;s floor indicator 
mounted above its shut doors as the golden and ornate arrow ticked 
upwards. She couldn&#39;t be absolutely certain her targets were returning 
directly to their suite--she would just have to take a gamble. If she 
waited to see what level the pair&#39;s elevator actually stopped on they 
would end up leaving her behind and subsequently elude her, and Kirika 
to boot.

Mireille hurriedly entered a different elevator that&#39;s doors were just 
slipping closed, and pressed the button for the floor Ryosuke and 
Vincent&#39;s room was on. After waiting for what felt like hours but in 
reality was less than a minute, the elevator arrived at level five and 
the blonde disembarked swiftly, her eyes discreetly but feverishly 
darting this way and that to sight her prey once again. She caught a 
brief flicker of a black ponytail bobbing around a corner of an 
adjoining hallway to her left, and then quickly chased after it, 
trotting the few metres to the intersection to narrow the escalating gap 
between herself and the men.

Mireille trailed behind Ryosuke and Vincent as all three travelled down 
a red-carpeted corridor devoid of other people, dark and varnished 
wooden doors that led to guestrooms arranged periodically on either 
side. She recognised the course they were taking. It appeared that the 
false Noir were returning to their shared suite as predicted. Perfect. 
It was all going according to plan.

Mireille and Kirika had taken the opportunity to learn the basic layout 
of the fifth floor of Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental while they were 
waiting for Ryosuke and Vincent to arrive. Knowing the environment where 
the inevitable hit was to take place in advance was a judicious practice 
for a professional assassin, and one that Mireille adhered to when the 
chance or resources were available. It allowed for more detailed 
preparation, and hence a more neat operation, which the Corsican 
preferred--equally so for this assignment also.

Ryosuke and Vincent rounded another corner that led to the hallway where 
their room was to be found, leaving Mireille&#39;s line of sight. The woman 
tried not to increase her step to catch up. The moment was looming; she 
could not jeopardise the plan&#39;s success now.

Mireille followed after the two men, and saw that they had arrived at 
the white double doors to their expensive suite; still evidently 
oblivious to the threat she posed. The moment had come, or at least was 
about to. Kirika should be hiding at the other end of the hall, out of 
sight for now, but would soon be approaching the enemy as Mireille was 
continuing to do unabated. The plan was to sandwich Ryosuke and Vincent 
from opposite sides, and, at the precise second when the pair crossed 
the threshold to their hotel room, Mireille would execute the man 
closest to her at the same instant Kirika would do likewise, before 
dumping the bodies in the privacy of the suite and leaving them to be 
discovered by housekeeping. And of course by then, the culprits for the 
mysterious murders would have been long gone. Clean and efficient, just 
how Mireille liked it.

Suddenly, to Mireille&#39;s alarm, Ryosuke and Vincent paused in opening the 
doors to their room and appeared to discuss something, before proceeding 
to look back the way they had come... right in her direction.

Mireille, an experienced and highly skilled assassin, did not react in 
the least to their scrutiny, easily curbing the urge to freeze like a 
deer caught in headlights. Instead, she kept on walking at a steady pace 
as to not arouse their suspicion, even when Ryosuke and Vincent started 
retracing their steps, coming ever closer towards her. It looked like 
they did not recognise her, however, or without a doubt they would have 
been drawing weapons at that very moment... unless they wanted her to 
believe that and lure her in into an ambush. A trickle of perspiration 
ran down the middle of the woman&#39;s back at the dire concept.

As Mireille passed by the duo on Vincent&#39;s left, she couldn&#39;t prevent 
her eyes from shifting circumspectly to look at the attractive man; out 
of caution or trepidation, she wasn&#39;t certain which. To her surprise and 
disquiet, she was met with the twin amber halos of Vincent&#39;s soft yet 
stunning eyes accompanied by a small, enticing smile on his features; 
one he most likely used to charm many a woman while his gentle gaze put 
his &#39;victim&#39; at ease. The combination held little sway over Mireille, 
though, no matter how especially gorgeous it made the man appear. She 
was more worried about the actual motivation behind the expression. Did 
Vincent--and therefore his partner, too--know her? Did he know the 
identities of the ones who rightfully held the title of Noir? Was it a 
smug smile that spelled impending doom for her? Or was it honestly just 
a pleasant one made to a beautiful woman who was walking by?

The muscles in Mireille&#39;s shoulders knotted anxiously. If she acted now, 
then she would definitely incur Vincent and Ryosuke&#39;s aggression, 
regardless of whether they really knew her or not. But if she didn&#39;t and 
the men did truly recognise her, then her hesitation would grant them an 
opening to strike first... a strike that Mireille doubted she would 
survive through.

After what felt like an eternity to Mireille, she at last progressed 
past Vincent and Ryosuke and then continued walking down the corridor, 
this time away from the men, but now with her vulnerable back to 
them.... A tempting target if they did know her face. But Kirika was 
still concealed around the corner ahead of her, a comforting--if 
unseen--presence. The blonde&#39;s dependable partner had evidently astutely 
decided to remain behind cover in the safety of the bordering hallway 
when she had seen the false Noir begin backtracking.

Mireille felt the tightness diminish in her shoulders. Good girl. Kirika 
would guard her back. And it also meant that they could salvage their 
plan with a few alterations, even if it would now be a little slapdash. 
Traces of blood would be left on the hallway&#39;s carpet after the modified 
plan was implemented, and the resulting pair of corpses would have to be 
dragged hastily into hiding before any witnesses happened by. Mireille 
disliked hauling dead bodies around, but there would be no other 
choice--she and Kirika would need time to make their escape without an 
alarm being sounded before they&#39;d had a chance to evacuate the building.

As Mireille crossed into the adjoining corridor, she turned her head a 
fraction to the left and made eye contact with Kirika who was positioned 
with her back against the wall just by the T-junction, her silenced 
Beretta held in both her hands, its extended barrel directed up to the 
ceiling. There were no other people in sight, but the blonde had 
expected as much as soon as she had seen her partner armed--the girl 
would not have revealed her weapon otherwise.

Mireille met Kirika&#39;s gaze for but a split second, yet it was enough 
time to convene her intentions with a mixture of a hard look and slight 
swing of her head back down the hallway she had just navigated. The 
woman knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that her counterpart would 
understand totally. Mireille and Kirika could tell what the other was 
thinking--within reasonable limits--mostly through each other&#39;s eyes. It 
was something that the two had been able to do from quite early in their 
association, and it had been a useful ability on several occasions, 
especially when on assignment, allowing them to predict each other&#39;s 
moves and subsequently work in harmony. Mireille had never given it much 
consideration; it had always transpired intuitively between her and 
Kirika, without so much as a hint of conscious effort. As if it were... 
natural for them.

Suddenly, with her long blonde locks fanning out widely behind her, 
Mireille broke the look with Kirika and spun around back the way she had 
come, pulling out her fully loaded Walther P99 from her handbag in one 
hand in the same fluid motion; a silencer attached to the gun. In 
perfect sync with the blonde assassin, Kirika made her move also, 
darting out from behind the wall with her Beretta M1934 raised in her 
hands, and placing herself in a ready stance beside her equally primed 
partner.

However, much to Mireille&#39;s horror, what greeted her and Kirika were not 
the defenceless backs of their oblivious targets, but rather a happily 
smiling Vincent brandishing dual Beretta Elites, one wielded in each 
hand, and both pointing straight at them. Ryosuke stood stationary a 
step behind his comrade, his back still to Mireille and Kirika, but now 
looking slightly over his left shoulder at the duo, a single violet eye 
able to be made out through his dangling white bangs a head above 
Vincent, watching the unfolding scene with languid interest.

Mireille registered this information in a tenth of a second before 
instinctively throwing herself behind the cover of the wall to her left, 
Kirika doing likewise opposite to her, just as Vincent began unloading 
steaming lead her and her partner&#39;s way with no regard to the glaring 
and undesirable attention the loud gunfire would attract.

Bullets pounded into the wall at the end of the corridor near to 
Mireille, tearing shards of wood and plaster free to rain down to the 
floor, before Vincent shifted his aim, directing fire at the woman&#39;s 
position. The Corsican assassin could hear the rounds hammering close to 
the edge of the wall she was hiding behind and could also detect a hint 
of the acrid smoke produced by their prior discharge from the firing 
chamber of one of the two Elites. The barrage effectively pinned her in 
place, unable to return fire without putting herself in Vincent&#39;s sure 
sights.

While the onslaught continued relentlessly, Mireille took the 
opportunity to spare a glance to her partner where the girl was taking 
cover on the other side of the T-junction across from her. Kirika was 
leaning with her back up against the wall and with her eyes tightly 
shut, while the top of her gun touched perpendicularly against her 
forehead, the darkhaired girl looking as if she were in deep meditation. 
Indeed, she appeared wholly undisturbed by the hail of bullets riddling 
the wall just around the corner from her, a multitude of holes now 
defacing its surface. It was as if Kirika was in another place entirely, 
but where, Mireille could not say.

Abruptly, Mireille heard the shooting gradually ease, and she 
transferred her focus from her partner&#39;s peculiar quirks to the peril at 
hand. Knowing that this was the moment she had been waiting for, she 
dropped to one knee into a crouch, letting go of her handbag in the same 
motion, then leaned out from around the bullet-ravaged corner, holding 
her Walther in a secure grip with two hands.

As the blonde did so, she saw that the cause of the ebbing gunfire was 
that Vincent had emptied one of his Elites, and was now dividing his 
remaining shots between Mireille and Kirika&#39;s locations, seeking to 
still keep them at bay albeit with his halved firepower. The gaudily 
dressed man steadily retreated all the while he maintained his vigilant, 
if somewhat manic, gaze on his would-be killers&#39; positions, his smile no 
longer happy but seeming forced, now a rather nasty rictus marring his 
once attractive features. Ryosuke on the other hand walked down the 
hallway with apparent calm, not so much as even looking in his 
assailants&#39; directions. He was either extremely brave or extremely 
arrogant. Perhaps both.

Mireille squeezed the trigger of her weapon in rapid succession, firing 
a trio of muted rounds at the pair of withdrawing men, hoping to put 
down at least one of them before they made it to the shelter of the 
intersection at the end of the hall... and before anybody came to 
investigate the racket of the gunfight.

But, to her dismay, her shots hit nothing but wood and plaster. Vincent 
had stooped low as soon as Mireille appeared from cover, and then 
scurried with alacrity behind Ryosuke, as if wishing to use the tall man 
as an impromptu shield. His fast and quite unexpected manoeuvre had been 
enough to throw off the Corsican&#39;s concentration and hence her aim, 
however, sparing him from kissing lead, much to the blonde&#39;s 
displeasure.

Desperately questing to remedy that fact at least in the case of one of 
the false Black Hands, Mireille shifted her attention to Ryosuke, just 
as he was about to disappear behind the protection of the far 
neighbouring corridor; his partner already having taken advantage of his 
screening body to do as much. She fired a short series of rounds at the 
white-haired man as he began rounding the corner after a scampering 
Vincent, all but one connecting with their target&#39;s exposed back. 
Mireille felt grim satisfaction start to rise up inside her at her 
success but it was rudely dashed aside as she saw, to her shock, Ryosuke 
react as if nothing had struck him at all, the man continuing to walk 
along placidly until he vanished down the other hallway. She had been 
certain she&#39;d hit him, willing to swear on it even, but evidently she 
had been mistaken or Ryosuke would be lying in a growing pool of his own 
blood and not escaping instead. Mireille must really be getting careless 
to miss such a clear shot.

Mireille shook her head in frustration and lowered her gun a fraction, 
inwardly cursing at how things had played out. While she was debating on 
whether or not to pursue Ryosuke and Vincent, she looked over to where 
Kirika was. The girl had slid down the wall and was now sitting with her 
knees drawn up to her chest, her eyes remaining shut and her firearm 
still resting against her forehead. She appeared more like a frail young 
girl than ever, albeit one armed with a gun. Mireille couldn&#39;t remember 
hearing the sound of a Beretta M1934 joining her Walther P99 and 
Vincent&#39;s two M92F Elites during the firefight--Kirika hadn&#39;t fired a 
single round.

Mireille stared at Kirika expressionlessly for a few moments, and then 
suddenly grabbed her discarded handbag and angrily shoved her Walther 
back into its confines. The woman knew their opportunity was lost. 
Someone would have heard all of the fierce gunfire. People were probably 
rushing to this very spot right this second, security personnel--or 
worse, the police--with them. Mireille could already hear faint shouts 
echoing down the hallways. She and Kirika had better simply run. They 
had failed.

******

Kirika watched emotionlessly as Mireille stormed into the living room of 
their apartment and hurled her handbag on the billiard table, sending 
several pool balls careering away atop Breffort&#39;s documents to ricochet 
wildly off the rubber sides. The blonde started to pace heatedly back 
and forth beside the green table, her heels beating a tattoo on the 
floor and her countenance one of acute distaste, while Kirika settled 
herself back against a wall and continued to stoically observe her 
partner&#39;s tirade.

&quot;We&#39;ve blown our best chance to end this,&quot; Mireille spat furiously, 
glaring hard at the wooden floorboards. &quot;If they didn&#39;t know what we 
looked like before, they certainly do now!&quot; She halted her agitated 
march, still frowning at the floor. &quot;They still might not be aware that 
we were once the true Noir, however,&quot; the woman went on in a quieter 
tone, more to herself than to Kirika. &quot;Small comfort, but it&#39;s 
something.&quot;

Mireille resumed her pacing, muttering to herself in a low voice below 
Kirika&#39;s threshold of hearing, before stopping at the end of the 
billiard table, leaning on it with her hands gripping either side 
tightly, her knuckles white. Mireille stared down at its felt surface 
with unseeing blue eyes, as if looking through the documents and pool 
balls scattered haphazardly on it. She then paused in her private rant 
and turned her head to Kirika, her expression seeming lost somewhere 
between anxiousness and sadness. But the look lasted only a brief 
instant before it vanished as she turned back to the billiard table to 
scowl at Breffort&#39;s papers, fuming silently.

With Mireille&#39;s outburst apparently out of steam for the time being, 
Kirika pushed off the wall, deciding to leave the blonde alone for a bit 
and brew some tea to help soothe her temper. &quot;I&#39;ll make some tea,&quot; she 
declared softly, before walking past Mireille, heading for the kitchen.

Mireille merely nodded absently and mumbled an acknowledgement, not 
moving from her position.

As Kirika went about filling the kettle with water in the kitchen, she 
thought back to today&#39;s earlier events. She couldn&#39;t help but be 
relieved at what had happened. She was glad Mireille had not been 
harmed, but she was also glad she hadn&#39;t needed to fire her gun at 
someone. Kirika had hesitated when the shooting started, loath to touch 
the darkness inside of herself. But in truth, she had touched it when 
she had burst out of cover with Mireille to confront Ryosuke and 
Vincent... but only fleetingly. She had recoiled after that first 
contact, her will to fight abandoning her outright as a result. Kirika 
didn&#39;t know whether Mireille had noticed her reluctance, but she hoped 
the blonde had not--she didn&#39;t want her partner to think she had let her 
down by not supporting her. She never wanted to disappoint Mireille.

Nevertheless, Kirika was conscious that this was only a temporary 
reprieve. She would have to fight eventually; sooner now, with Ryosuke 
and Vincent aware of her and Mireille. Dealing with the two men would be 
even more difficult and in turn more dangerous in the future. 
Ultimately, Kirika&#39;s resistance would not be able to last forever... it 
would be kill or be killed.

To be continued....


Author&#39;s ramblings:

Only some very mild action and angsty stuff in this chapter. I debated 
whether Mireille would be motivated enough to do a bit of pacing and 
fuming, and in front of Kirika, but after considering it for a while I 
figured her frustration of failing to kill R+V (and how much was riding 
on that she succeed) would cause her to lose herself for a moment or 
two.</pre>
