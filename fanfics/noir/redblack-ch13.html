Casualties of War


Dominique D&#39;Aubigne reshuffled today&#39;s reports into two neat stacks on 
her polished chrome desk, having just finished her initial cursory 
browse through them for anything out of the ordinary. One pile&#39;s topics 
were of the bland, innocuous, variety--manufacturing schedules and the 
progress thus far for this month&#39;s batch of medicinal products; the 
amounts of assorted raw ingredients expended and which ones needed to be 
replenished; new wholesalers to be added to the merchandise delivery 
rosters--the list was almost endless. However its counterpart&#39;s subject 
matters belonged to a business that was entirely more illegitimate than 
Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals&#39; public industry--an ugly twin. That other 
pile contained illicit information, including a second manufacturing 
schedule for the latest batch of &#39;recreational&#39; drugs the company 
produced on the sly, the current prices of the popular narcotics and 
amphetamines being circulated around the streets of Yokohama and the 
rest of the Kanagawa prefecture at the moment, and which specific 
&#39;products&#39; the criminal organisations under Ishinomori control needed 
restocked so that they could continue to perform their assigned duty of 
distribution and sale. And that was just a minute sample of what the 
stack contained--the list of reports concerning Ishinomori 
Pharmaceuticals&#39; illegal activities was, like its mate, also virtually 
never-ending.

It was as one might expect from a multinational corporation operating 
dual enterprises, however. Two businesses running in parallel did tend 
to create an abundance of paperwork on a daily basis, and it wasn&#39;t as 
if either was any less genuine than the other; both required likewise 
consideration. Just because one such business was against the law didn&#39;t 
mean it was to be treated any differently than its partner; it merely 
had to have some of its own unique trade practices applied to it. 
Business was business.

Moreover, it was what Dominique did and had been doing for many, many 
years. She was accustomed to sifting through mounds of documents made 
from enough paper to level a forest, her keen eyes singling out the 
relevant details from the pages while her sharp wits processed them, 
deliberating on what action was called for in relation to the data, if 
any. She would even go so far as to say she enjoyed it. It was stark and 
logical work, but that was what appealed to Dominique; she liked losing 
herself in the monotony of the facts and figures. Her mental faculties 
became focused exclusively on her task while everything else just 
flitted away into the background of her mind, where it was forgotten for 
a time. During that period when her thoughts were dedicated to 
uncluttered down-to-earth analysis, Dominique turned into an emotionless 
and empty being, a woman who felt and was absolutely nothing, who 
possessed no past, who had no memories--she simply existed. Dominique 
became a woman at peace, as short as that peace lasted. But the peace 
was counterfeit, a product of her dissociation from her mind and its 
reflections, not one originating from her heart. Dominique&#39;s heart no 
longer had the capability to ever be at peace.

While Dominique continued to toil and generate sound advice in regards 
to the management of Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals, these days it fell on 
apathetic ears, leaving her predominantly in control of the 
conglomerate&#39;s operations. Kaede was the CEO and chief owner of the 
company, but she had little interest in its functions and affairs as 
long as it went on earning money to fund the crusade against Soldats. 
The child only listened to Dominique&#39;s news and counsel on the war and 
nothing else. Perhaps that was for the best, though. Kaede&#39;s obsession 
for vengeance against the clandestine organisation practically consumed 
her every waking moment; she would have no mentality for the tedium of 
corporate matters even if she were willing to take an involved role in 
the supervision of the firm. And so then it was left to Dominique to 
seize hold of the reins to her family&#39;s business and steer it along the 
correct course on her behalf.

It wasn&#39;t as if the advisor turned stand-in company president minded in 
the least, however. She was suited to the job. Dominique knew the 
workings of Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals better than anyone alive--the 
rest who had were gone, now--and in addition possessed the drive to keep 
the company flourishing for as long as humanly possible. It had been 
*her* company, *her* legacy; it even had her name attached to it. If it 
continued to stay afloat, then a part of her would always remain 
thriving in this world--a form of immortality... or so Dominique liked 
to believe sometimes in her moments of weakness. In reality a financial 
empire of lifeless glass and steel proved to be a vastly poor substitute 
to the vibrant flesh and blood woman who had once sat at its head, and 
provided about as much comfort as cold hard cash did to a lonely heart.

Dominique pushed her glasses up further on the bridge of her nose from 
where they had slipped down with a finger, and then straightened her 
posture in her high-backed black leather chair, her eyes straying away 
from the desk and the heaps of paper resting on its metallic surface. 
Her frosty green gaze wandered around her office, its modern and austere 
design of rigid steel panels and shiny silver doors a predominant theme 
throughout the interior of Ishinomori plaza. The multistorey building 
was sleek and sexy, cold and unfeeling; a forbidding tower that stood 
erect almost at the centre of the harbour city of Yokohama, a fortress 
beyond any other castle that had ever graced this ancient land before 
it, one that could dissuade would-be raiders from the sheer thought of 
invasion with a mere glimpse of its unforgiving reinforced walls. It 
fitted its part as the headquarters for the powerful empire that had the 
strength of will to oppose another, larger, and tyrannical one. It was 
the solitary bastion that stood against the corrupt group that Soldats 
had become, and was the staging point for the impending revolution that 
would cleanse its ranks.

A bittersweet smile gently grew on Dominique&#39;s face as her eyes 
inescapably came to fall upon the bright, garish paintings that adorned 
the silver walls of her office, standing out prominently against the 
contrastingly lacklustre steel panels. They were abstract pictures, the 
kind that resembled an untamed mess of colour as if the artist had made 
each brushstroke purely on a whim. They were most certainly not to 
Dominique&#39;s refined and practical predilections... yet she adored them 
nonetheless. Not for their art, but because they were wild, 
undisciplined, passionate--so like *her*. Dominique could still recall 
vividly when the enchanting white-haired woman had hung them up, citing 
that the dull office was horribly dreary and that her friend would 
became depressed if she had to stare at plain chrome walls all day long. 
Perhaps that was the actual reason Dominique was fond of the paintings; 
because Hikaru had picked them out and arranged them around the office 
with her own two hands. She remembered that she hadn&#39;t really liked them 
very much at all until after her lover had passed away. Now she couldn&#39;t 
bear the thought of removing the pictures, despite the pain looking at 
them everyday brought.

Dominique&#39;s eyes drifted to the framed photograph sitting near one 
corner of her desk, as they often were inclined to do when her 
disposition became wistful. It was a picture of her and Hikaru when they 
were younger, a snapshot of happier times that could never be 
recaptured. In it the two women stood sedately next to each other on a 
cheerful backdrop of green grass and blue skies, their shoulders 
touching, and with mirroring demure smiles curling their lips. But in 
spite of the two figures&#39; reserved expressions the depths of their eyes 
gleamed with joy and contentment, the bliss they had felt at the time 
shining through the glass of the picture frame; an echo from the past. 
Dominique and Hikaru were both garbed in business suits in the 
photograph--the latter in white, the former in contrary black. It was an 
accurate visual representation of how they had lived. Their 
personalities had been poles apart, direct opposites of one another. 
Hikaru had been the flighty, creative type; her head stuck in the clouds 
oft times, while Dominique had been the sensible, logical one with her 
feet firmly on the ground and who served to anchor her counterpart when 
necessary. Dominique and Hikaru had been a match made in heaven--*true* 
soulmates--two halves that had made a whole. They had completed one 
another.

Of course, it hadn&#39;t always been that way. When Dominique and Hikaru had 
first met as commerce students studying in Paris, the darkhaired woman 
had regarded her future love as incredibly flaky and irritating to no 
end; someone whose chirpy company she had found sickening and hardly 
tolerable to be in for any lengthy period of time. They had been so 
different, so unalike in manner and temperament. But it was said that 
opposites attract, and in this case the saying had rang true. In spite 
of her poor first impressions of the woman, before Dominique knew it she 
and Hikaru had become inseparable and the very best of friends. Not a 
day had went by when they didn&#39;t see each other or spend time together; 
sharing classes and cramming for exams, or enjoying the pleasant 
diversions the capitol city had to offer. Hikaru inadvertently became 
the sole light in Dominique&#39;s otherwise rather dismal life, her upbeat 
nature tearing down the dark webs that had normally ensnared the French 
woman&#39;s hardened heart. Hikaru&#39;s sheer presence had made Dominique feel 
and become a better person.

After they had graduated, Hikaru had invited her best friend to migrate 
to Japan with her and help manage the Ishinomori family corporation that 
she was taking over chief ownership of from her ailing mother. It had 
been a proposal that Dominique had most readily accepted. She&#39;d had no 
cause to remain in France; she&#39;d had no family of her own or any other 
obligations to keep her in the country. Moreover, the notion of being 
parted from Hikaru had lain heavy on her heart and mind; regardless of 
what had been in France for Dominique she would have still forsaken 
everything to accompany her friend. By then she had developed a deep 
attachment to the Japanese beauty, one she eventually recognised as pure 
and unconditional love.

Yet Dominique ignored her feelings for Hikaru and chose instead to 
bottle them up secretly inside her heart. She had known that her 
cherished friend did not possess the same sentiments as she herself did 
and furthermore she hadn&#39;t wanted to risk jeopardising the close 
relationship they already had. And so the years ticked by, Dominique 
acting as Hikaru&#39;s personal assistant and advisor for the workings of 
Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals, and also as her devoted best friend and 
companion... but nothing more. It had been somewhat saddening for 
Dominique to hide her love for Hikaru, but simply being near the woman&#39;s 
radiant spirit had been enough to placate her aching heart. In time 
Dominique--who had been born into the covert worldwide society known as 
Soldats, and desiring to have no secrets between herself and Hikaru bar 
the one that dwelled in the left side of her chest--introduced her 
friend to the organisation and to Altena, a visionary who the darkhaired 
woman greatly admired and whose beliefs she fervently agreed with. To 
Dominique&#39;s delight and relief, Hikaru grew to become a faithful 
supporter of Altena, and in turn put the fears she&#39;d had that her love 
would reject the group and her with it to rest.

But then *he* showed up. Shinichi Sakamoto. A Soldats follower of the 
current warped order... and the disgusting man who by some perverted 
twist of fate stole Hikaru&#39;s heart. It had been an utter chance 
encounter between the two during a scheduled gathering of all the 
prominent Soldats members residing in the Kanto territory, but that was 
all it took for &#39;love&#39; to blossom. Despite Dominique&#39;s ardent labours to 
get her friend to return to her senses, within a year of meeting each 
other Hikaru and Shinichi wed. Shinichi, being the weak man that he had 
been, had taken Hikaru&#39;s surname in respect to her more powerful family, 
and consequently the union was seen by all as the Sakamoto lineage 
marrying into the Ishinomori clan, not the other way around.

Dominique and Hikaru became rather distant after the loathsome wedding, 
the French woman nursing a broken heart that bled a furious hatred into 
her soul for her lost love&#39;s husband, a hatred that placed her at odds 
with the object of her affection on many instances. More years past, and 
Hikaru birthed two children, a daughter and son, while in the meantime 
Dominique descended further and further into a bleak depression as hate 
and despair consumed her. So caught up in her self-pity, she never 
noticed that Hikaru was slowly changing, too... and also for the worse. 
Shinichi had been a pathetic, craven man, who ultimately developed a 
fierce resentment for his wife and her superior status as the head of 
the Ishinomori family. Although he was Hikaru&#39;s husband, she was deemed 
as the genuine strength behind the clan. Shinichi was merely a 
ceremonial figurehead; he had no real authority beyond what his wife 
elected to give him, like tossed food scraps from the table. As a 
result, he had seen himself as not much better than one of Hikaru&#39;s 
subordinates, which had galled him terribly. Whatever affection he had 
held for Hikaru--which couldn&#39;t have been anywhere near the degree the 
divine woman had been worthy of, considering--was replaced by bitterness 
that he regularly made apparent to his blameless spouse. Hikaru had been 
a delicate flower in full bloom when Dominique had first formed a 
close-knit friendship with her, but Shinichi&#39;s perceived 
self-inadequacies effectively trampled her already withering spirit into 
the ground, petals crushed callously beneath his heel as they shrivelled 
up in an effort to protect themselves from the abuse. The playful and 
energetic woman Dominique had known and loved deteriorated into a mere 
shell of her former self.

However, Hikaru&#39;s torment--while it had torn at Dominique&#39;s heart and 
soul when she had finally learned of it--ended up being a blessing in 
disguise. Following months of suffering in silence, Hikaru eventually 
sought aid for her troubles from her dejected best friend and business 
advisor... and also sought solace in old college friend&#39;s arms. 
Dominique wasn&#39;t precisely sure how it had happened--one minute they had 
been talking, the next Hikaru had been embracing her tightly, gazing 
imploringly into her eyes before kissing her softly on the lips--but it 
hadn&#39;t really mattered; the dream she had believed hopeless with her 
love&#39;s marriage had been at last realised. When Hikaru had revealed her 
feelings for Dominique that had evidently surfaced under Shinichi&#39;s 
mistreatment, the misery that had polluted the darkhaired woman had 
instantly been lifted. She had eagerly returned her friend&#39;s kiss--their 
first of countless--and confirmed what her heart had always felt for her 
fair-haired and pale-skinned angel. It had been like the conclusion of a 
fairytale; a happy ending at last after years of pain, long unrequited 
love made a joyous reality.

But there had been one obstacle to Dominique and Hikaru&#39;s newfound 
romantic relationship--Shinichi. Hikaru had still had a husband; that 
she loved someone else and felt nothing for him hadn&#39;t changed that 
fact. Divorce hadn&#39;t been an option; it would have split the Ishinomori 
Empire in two--while Shinichi hadn&#39;t had any real standing in the 
family, he&#39;d yet had his legal rights. Hikaru had opted to entice him to 
voluntarily leave the clan and annul their marriage vows with a hefty 
cash settlement, but as Dominique had predicted the man had been greedy 
and had wanted at the very least half of his wife&#39;s assets. Shinichi had 
been of the new age Soldats breed, after all.

No, the only path Dominique had seen for the love she shared with Hikaru 
to come to complete, unrestrained fruition was if Shinichi were to die. 
Hikaru had been against it at first--she had still retained her 
compassion in spite of her husband&#39;s maltreatment--but Dominique had 
know that it had to be done. It had been times like then when she had to 
step in and do what her kind hearted angel could not. And step in 
Dominique had. Disposing of Shinichi had been a relatively simple 
affair; he was a notable member of Soldats but not high enough in the 
hierarchy to have a thorough investigation launched into his death, so 
an arranged &#39;accident&#39; was sufficient. Through Hikaru&#39;s underlings 
Dominique discreetly had Shinichi&#39;s car wind up wrapped around an 
unyielding lamppost one night with the man inside, and then the issue of 
her lover&#39;s husband had been quietly resolved, leaving them free to 
pursue their feelings. Hikaru hadn&#39;t shed so much as a tear for her 
spouse following his passing, but while she had not mourned the loss of 
the man she had mourned his death nonetheless--her face betrayed the 
grieve she had felt that it had come to murder to escape him. Dominique 
had consoled her however, and the Japanese woman swiftly recovered and 
equally as quickly forgot about her disastrous marriage.

And then that should have been the end of it. Dominique and Hikaru 
should have lived on happily ever after together, as the conclusions of 
fairytales usually go. And they had, for a while at any rate. Hikaru 
gradually reverted back to her cheerful self once again with her best 
friend Dominique as her lover, and the French woman herself became 
considerably more light-hearted thanks to her partner&#39;s infectious 
disposition. Hikaru even had insisted that Dominique take a more active 
role in her daughter and son&#39;s lives too, which the darkhaired woman had 
complied with, although she had been careful to hide the nature of her 
relationship with their mother. While their romantic association was 
common knowledge to Ishinomori family vassals, they chose to keep it 
concealed from Kaede and Ryosuke since neither had been sure how the 
two--who had been teenagers at the time--would handle the realisation 
that their mother, in spite of being a widow, was bedding someone who 
wasn&#39;t their father and another woman at that. Hikaru had wished to tell 
them once they were a little older when they could perhaps understand 
better, and subsequently truly accept Dominique as a surrogate parent. 
It had been just one of Dominique and Hikaru&#39;s many plans for the 
future; a future so bright, so promising... and one that had been 
tragically cut short.

The memory of that nightmarish day still burned clearly in Dominique&#39;s 
mind, a permanent tattoo that marred it like a festering wound that 
never seemed to heal. It hurt intensely to recollect the events, and yet 
she inexorably did so whenever she was left unoccupied with her thoughts 
for too long, as if she had a masochistic urge to remind herself of why 
she was alone here today. It had been just another meeting, Dominique 
and Hikaru travelling by car with their regular escorts to a business 
appointment related to Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals. A simple thing, 
really. But then the simplicity of the situation had abruptly altered as 
their car had suddenly been overwhelmed with gunfire from all sides. An 
ambush from nearby rooftops, Dominique had later learned. The tires had 
gone first with almost four simultaneous bangs, sending their vehicle 
veering wildly off the road and to a violent stop lodged halfway in a 
bus shelter, the screech of twisting metal from the impact akin to 
otherworldly shrieks of pain. Next the driver had been taken out where 
he had sat stunned behind the wheel--as extra insurance that the car 
would be halted, Dominique&#39;s shaken mind had hazily surmised at the 
time--followed by the bodyguard adjacent to him in the front passenger 
seat. Then the gunmen had turned their attention to the two women who 
had still been breathing in the backseat. And then Dominique&#39;s world had 
been brought to an end.

Thinking back now, Dominique should have seen it coming. Hikaru had 
always been the selfless one between them; where Dominique was rather 
self-centred when it came to anything but her lover, her Japanese 
counterpart more than made up for her deficiency. But on that day, the 
white-haired woman&#39;s benevolent nature had led to her downfall. Before 
Dominique had registered what her partner&#39;s intentions had been, 
Hikaru&#39;s body had been thrown over hers, pushing her down flat on the 
backseat. In that fraction of a second between the car crash and when 
the gunfire had been redirected to them by the assassins, Hikaru had 
decided to use her own body to shield Dominique from the incoming hail 
of bullets, to accept all of the pain and suffer in her lover&#39;s place.

The Ishinomori family bodyguards in the other two cars that had made up 
their small convoy had ultimately fought off the gunmen, but for Hikaru 
and Dominique their achievement had arrived too late. Dominique had held 
her best friend and the love of her life in her lap that afternoon, 
watching on with agonising helplessness as she bled away her last. 
Hikaru had said nothing as she had lain dying, instead simply smiling up 
at the French woman with tearful violet eyes. There had been no final 
words, no declarations of everlasting love... but then there hadn&#39;t been 
a need of any. Both women had known how they had felt about one another, 
right until the very last moment.

Hikaru had gently slipped away from Dominique shortly afterwards. She 
had died in her arms, ascending to Heaven to become the angel she had 
already been in life. Dominique had felt like she had died, too, except 
her spirit had instead descended into her own private Hell. She hadn&#39;t 
been able to comprehend that the woman she had loved and adored for most 
of her life was dead. Hikaru had been the sole person who had ever 
touched her heart, who had ever stirred her soul... she had been her 
first and only love. To lose her was on par with dying herself. They had 
barely had two years together as lovers; so brief, an ephemeral moment 
in time. Dominique had realised then that their fairytale had never 
actually ended when they had shared their first kiss; it had just begun. 
But it had ended there in the wrecked car that day, when two joint 
hearts had died as one.

The time that had passed after Hikaru&#39;s death had seemed surreal to 
Dominique, as if she were living in a dream. But then she had been--and 
still was--a dead woman living beyond her days. The world became dull to 
her, and she listless, the shock that Hikaru was gone still not quite 
sinking in, even years later. Dominique had dwelled on suicide several 
times, but she had yet had ties to life--Hikaru&#39;s business, and her 
children. As well as the thirst for vengeance.

Through her contacts in Soldats, Dominique had discovered that the 
attack that had claimed her lover&#39;s life had been a sanctioned hit 
ordered by the council themselves. Out of fear of Altena&#39;s imminent 
commencement of Le Grand Retour, the spineless Soldats council had 
decided to take out any influential members of the noble woman&#39;s enclave 
they could as a form of pre-emptive strike to delay the ritual; a list 
that Hikaru Ishinomori had apparently topped. Once Dominique had learned 
that the corrupt order of Soldats had been responsible for the murder of 
her lover, renewed vigour had surged into her spirit, fuelled by cold 
fury. There would be plenty of time to die after Soldats had fallen and 
been reborn... after they had paid for their unforgivable sin.

Dominique closed her eyes--the orbs stinging with unshed tears beneath 
their lids--blocking out the sight of the photograph. She then swivelled 
her chair around to face the large set of windows behind her, opening 
her eyes again to take in the view of Yokohama in the early morning 
sunlight, what had been the preliminary battleground--now conquered--for 
the war. And it was a war. Dominique was fighting the good fight, 
striving to do what Altena could not--initiate Le Grand Retour and see 
it through to completion. Make no mistake, however; she wasn&#39;t doing it 
for the deceased visionary. This was for Hikaru; this was retribution. 
The new order of Soldats were evidently extremely afraid of returning to 
the old ways--of being purified--and Dominique knew that was the key to 
fulfilling her vengeance.

But she wasn&#39;t as reckless as Altena had been to place all her hopes in 
the Black Hands of Soldats--Noir. It would take more than a mere two 
assassins to rid the globe of the present tainted incarnation of 
Soldats; it would take a force of immeasurable might. Furthermore the 
current embodiment of Noir was too volatile; the duo had after all been 
the ones who had killed the self-professed &#39;Kind Mother&#39; and most of her 
followers with her, trouncing her ambitions. Noir was purely a symbolic 
representation of Le Grand Retour. Yet it was a vital one nevertheless.

The ceremonial significance of the Eternal Darkness was the precise 
purpose of Ryosuke and his nauseatingly chauvinistic friend&#39;s being in 
Paris, France, at this very moment. There was an item residing in the 
possession of a Soldats member in the city that had been taken as an 
apparent souvenir from the Manor following Altena&#39;s demise and before 
Dominique&#39;s operatives could spirit it away; an item that was necessary 
for any replacement Noir that was named by her in the future to hold 
water and be regarded as official. Ryosuke and Vincent had been charged 
to find and retrieve that precious object. However, the French woman had 
always known where it was being kept, but she&#39;d had her reasons for 
withholding the knowledge. In fact it wasn&#39;t until about an hour ago 
when she had at last disclosed the item&#39;s location to Ryosuke via 
telephone.

Ryosuke, while being of Hikaru&#39;s blood, regrettably had inherited none 
of his magnificent mother&#39;s qualities bar some of her fine looks--he 
essentially took after his wretched father. And, like his father, he 
appeared to share in Shinichi&#39;s dislike of Dominique and her past close 
familiarity with Hikaru. When he had still been alive to plague both 
Hikaru and Dominique&#39;s existences with his vile presence, the spiteful 
man had visibly begrudged his wife&#39;s then platonic relationship with the 
French woman on whatever grounds his feeble brain had conjured up, be it 
out of typical male possessiveness for his spouse or simply plain envy 
at her warm rapport with her friend.

But in Ryosuke&#39;s particular case, his loathing of Dominique was based on 
something greater than the advisor&#39;s prior chaste friendship with his 
mother. Even though Hikaru and Dominique had strived hard to maintain 
the confidentiality of their romantic association subsequent to 
Shinichi&#39;s demise, Ryosuke had unfortunately stumbled upon the pair 
whilst they had been locked in a compromising position--their arms 
enfolded lovingly around one another&#39;s necks while they engaged in a 
passionate kiss. Naturally, the two women&#39;s attentions had been immersed 
wholly in their intimate activities, and thus neither had noticed that 
they had been caught &#39;in the act&#39;--in a manner of speaking--until the 
inferences the teenage Ryosuke had drawn from his first glimpse had been 
permanently engraved in his mind, unalterable regardless of what Hikaru 
or Dominique had then said to the contrary after the fact.

Ryosuke had not taken his newly discovered insight in a favourable 
fashion, going so far as to abandon his mother and her supposed 
&#39;replacement&#39; lover in disgust, taking refuge in Yokohama&#39;s criminal 
underworld. Hikaru had been inconsolable at this betrayal, weeping day 
and night for her wayward and impetuous firstborn. This pain had been 
compounded soon after when Kaede had left to join him, missing her elder 
brother although Dominique couldn&#39;t imagine why. Later Hikaru had tried 
to reconcile with Ryosuke on numerous occasions, but he never paid the 
woman&#39;s pleadings any consideration at all; the heartless, ungrateful 
child. Hikaru had gone to her grave thinking that her son had despised 
her. Dominique still hadn&#39;t forgiven him for that malicious wrongdoing.

The deep-seated animosity between Dominique and Ryosuke persisted to 
this day. Both continually vied for Kaede&#39;s full trust, the child having 
inherited virtually total leadership and tenure of the Ishinomori 
Empire. Many times Ryosuke had beseeched his more important sister to 
dismiss the French &#39;interloper&#39; from her primary position as advisor and 
personal assistant to the CEO in the family&#39;s company, before he&#39;d 
realised that his efforts were being wasted. Hikaru hadn&#39;t left 
Dominique any portion of her substantial empire in her Will on the basis 
that her lover wasn&#39;t actually a member of her family--although the 
darkhaired woman knew for certain that she had considered her as 
one--but as a alternative she had made it fundamentally clear that the 
person who had been her best friend and partner in life was to remain 
where she was at Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals indefinitely and without 
question. With his late mother&#39;s parting wishes essentially safeguarding 
Dominique&#39;s place in the empire, a frustrated Ryosuke had been rendered 
powerless--Kaede was not apt to undermine Hikaru&#39;s biddings; she 
regarded her mother&#39;s last words as unbreakable law.

However, the assurance of Dominique continuing to play her role as 
Kaede&#39;s assistant and advisor for the foreseeable future did not stop 
the battle of wills she and Ryosuke relentlessly fought in. Deploying 
the ex-yakuza clansman and his lout of a companion in Paris with the 
task of hunting down and retrieving the item stolen from the Manor that 
Dominique needed was that latest such clash... and in this specific 
conflict the elder competitor had prevailed almost utterly. With Ryosuke 
out of her hair, the advisor had been able to further her own plans for 
the Ishinomori Empire and ensconce herself deeper into Kaede&#39;s good 
graces without the boy&#39;s irksome meddling to hinder her.

Yet this had been a mere secondary goal to Dominique. In addition to 
charging Ryosuke and his womanising idiot of a friend to find and bring 
the sacred artefact to Japan, she had arranged it so that they had 
adopted the alias of the famed Noir while abroad, under the pretence 
that the name would unlock doors for them in Paris that would normally 
have to be blown open with blazing guns. It had been easy to persuade 
them to follow her request and utilise the age-old title; they had been 
relatively sheltered living in the Asia-Pacific region from the tales of 
Europe&#39;s thousand-year-old Eternal Darkness; indeed, they had never even 
heard of the legendary assassin duo. Little had Ryosuke and Vincent 
known that the genuine purpose for their use of the designation was to 
attract the attention of French Soldats operatives, and perhaps even the 
true Noir who Dominique was aware were lying dormant in Paris. It had 
been her hope that the name would ultimately bring more harm than good, 
and that enemies would harry Ryosuke and Vincent throughout their 
search. And if one of them were to die--with preference to Shinichi&#39;s 
spawn, but either was fine--then that would be perfectly all right as 
well.

But Dominique knew that that outcome would be a stretch. It wasn&#39;t as if 
Ryosuke and Vincent were mere two-bit hooligans lacking any talent in 
the martial variety, no matter what she liked to imagine them as. 
Moreover, if both were to somehow be killed, Dominique wouldn&#39;t obtain 
the object that was currently in Soldats hands she desired. The 
risk--albeit small, unless the true Noir awakened from their torpor to 
defend their rightful pseudonym--that Ryosuke *and* Vincent died during 
their mission was what had eventually compelled Dominique to phone 
Shinichi&#39;s son and inform him that the artefact was in the custody of 
Albert Laroque, a reasonably prominent Soldats follower of the new 
order. Laroque was a well-known aficionado of antiques and rare texts, 
and his estate in Paris boasted a sizable collection of such things 
within its walls--including the relic Dominique wanted. Obviously the 
security at his dwellings would be severe indeed, but the woman was 
quite confident that Ryosuke and Vincent would succeed in liberating 
what she sought. After all, due to Dominique&#39;s influence Kaede also 
pined for the artefact, and what she wanted her older brother got for 
her. Despite his customary taciturn countenance, it was plain to see 
that Ryosuke was completely besotted with his younger sister. It wasn&#39;t 
surprising, however; Kaede Ishinomori truly was a beautiful, 
captivating, and lovely child in all respects.

Dominique slowly closed her eyes and allowed her posture to sag, 
slouching back into her chair. She smiled faintly as her thoughts turned 
to Kaede, her exquisite charge, the only aspect of her wretched life 
that gave her joy. While Ryosuke was his father&#39;s son, Kaede was most 
definitely her mother&#39;s daughter. She was the near spitting image of 
Hikaru in her younger years, the lone disparity her shorter hairstyle. 
Conversely their personalities were somewhat different. Kaede&#39;s mind was 
a little... unbalanced, which Dominique deduced was the woeful product 
that the trauma of losing her wonderful mother at an early age had 
brought--the French woman was familiar with the horrific pain the child 
was experiencing firsthand. As a result, Kaede--through no fault of her 
own--possessed a nasty streak that frequently manifested itself 
characteristically in displays of ferociously violent behaviour. Yet 
Dominique had witnessed the compassion she had too, the compassion that 
Hikaru&#39;s heart had contained while it had still beat. She knew that deep 
down inside Kaede was her *real* self, her real persona that only every 
so often made its appearance with acts of unexpected kindness. 
Nevertheless, Dominique adored every facet of Hikaru&#39;s daughter, and 
that sentiment even incorporated her more... exotic... traits.

And besides, those aggressive attributes of Kaede were a benefit to the 
campaign against Soldats, their *mutual* campaign against Soldats. Kaede 
wholeheartedly concurred with her assistant&#39;s hunger to avenge Hikaru&#39;s 
murder, although her vengeance also encompassed paying back Soldats for 
her father&#39;s death on top of that--she was under the impression that 
Shinichi was assassinated by the group as well as her mother; an 
erroneous fact that Dominique was responsible for. It wouldn&#39;t do to 
have Kaede know the truth, after all. In any case, her parents&#39; slayings 
were what fed her fires of retribution, fires that raged like an inferno 
inside her as apposed to Dominique&#39;s icy artic blizzard. To Dominique 
revenge was a dish best served cold--the colder the better in fact. And 
at least one of them had to keep a level head in this war. It was 
Dominique&#39;s duty to provide Kaede with proper objective council, along 
with cooling her blazing spirit when it grew too unruly. It was much 
like the times when she&#39;d had to compose Hikaru&#39;s spirit during the 
periods it became overly whimsical. Yes, Kaede certainly was her 
mother&#39;s daughter. They were so alike. So alike....

Dominique&#39;s eyes opened and sat up straight--her smile gone--before she 
rather briskly spun her black chair around to face her desk, stopping it 
abruptly in place with her feet. She then simply stared at the surface 
of the desk for a few moments, although she saw none of its contents, 
before shutting her eyes briefly and exhaling softly. Nothing good came 
of when she was left alone with just her own mind for company. 
Furthermore reflecting on the events of the past was a meaningless 
endeavour; a misuse of one&#39;s time, time better spent on worthwhile 
undertakings. Yes. All that thinking about the past led to was grief and 
pain, grief and pain that fostered errant thoughts.

Dominique shook her head slightly and sighed again. Grief and pain. A 
pity she couldn&#39;t stop reminiscing in spite of her awareness of those 
dual end products. What she needed was something to divert her mind&#39;s 
attention so that she could return to her calm, poised self; not this 
miserable woman she was here and now.

With that in mind, Dominique raised her head a little and reached over 
to lay her left hand on a yellow folder on her tidy desk, resting to one 
side of the two piles of business reports. It was relatively thin, but 
held yet more reports. Except that these reports were on the struggle 
against Soldats, the sort of material that Kaede was interested in.

Turning her gaze away from the folder, the advisor looked at the double 
doors off to her right where the CEO&#39;s office was located adjacent to 
hers. In addition to the reports on the war, Kaede would also want to 
hear the so-called good news that her &#39;Big Brother&#39; was returning to 
Yokohama momentarily.

Dominique smiled to herself. It was all the more reason to pay the 
darling girl a visit. Getting up gracefully from her chair, the French 
woman--with folder in hand--stepped around from behind the desk and 
proceeded towards Kaede Ishinomori&#39;s office, with her mood already 
beginning to improve.

******

Mireille moved like a nimble cat on the prowl as she skulked swiftly 
down the narrow pitch-black alley where the entrance to Simon&#39;s computer 
shop was located, her footfalls on the old irregular cobblestones hushed 
and generating no telltale echoes an average person&#39;s would. But then 
she wasn&#39;t an average person. She lived her life by the sword--by the 
gun. For people like Mireille the night was when she thrived; it was her 
time, her realm. When darkness descended and shrouded the daylight world 
in its cloak of ebony, those of the black path truly awakened. Enveloped 
in the barren shadows that their lives were perpetually immersed in 
regardless of the hour, senses heightened and wits sharpened--nocturnal 
perceptions roused from their daytime slumber. After dusk the danger 
always seemed more real somehow--more tangible--that an assassin found 
herself or himself functioning in a state of highly acute awareness. 
Mireille wasn&#39;t exactly sure why that was, but nevertheless she had 
conjured up some theories during her idle moments. For the length of the 
night an assassin was a little closer to the dark paved road of murder 
they treaded upon--the gloom could be seen as a physical manifestation 
of the black path, and as such provided an intimacy that the warm 
sunlight flooded day could not reproduce. Simply put, a traveller of the 
path felt nearer to Death once the sun had set.

However, in Mireille&#39;s case she knew it was all basically just a frame 
of mind. She was no closer to the grave than any other moment in her 
life, the likely hazardous undertaking she was presently engaged in 
notwithstanding. The day was wrought with more or less the same perils 
as night. Perhaps the actual cause of her sensitised psychological 
condition was that the shadows had the potential to harbour any number 
and degree of threats--it was the fresh abundance of unknown factors 
that were responsible for the increased anxiety. Nevertheless, one did 
have to be on their utmost alert when general visibility was reduced; 
the intensified cautiousness was not misplaced.

Or maybe it was really because Mireille was heading into a situation 
along with Kirika that she did not find appealing a single bit. Being 
coerced into dealing with two of Soldats&#39; enemies by a high ranking 
official like Breffort was one thing, but following the proposal of his 
*apparent* lackey was quite the other. The Corsican couldn&#39;t be sure 
that the man she and her partner had encountered in Slick Chicks 
honestly was part of Breffort&#39;s faction in Soldats. While Mireille was 
almost completely positive that &#39;Jacques&#39; was a member of the worldwide 
society--he knew details about the group as well as certain specifics 
regarding her and Kirika&#39;s involvement with Breffort not to be, and 
furthermore possessing the knowledge that the two young women had been 
dubbed the true Noir awarded him extra credibility--she could not have 
the likewise confidence that he was under Breffort&#39;s jurisdiction. If 
the words of Mireille and Kirika&#39;s benefactor were to be considered 
sincere, the whole organisation of Soldats bar his division viewed the 
pair as unconditional if inactive foes. Consequently, it was entirely 
possible that Jacques worked for someone in Soldats other than Breffort; 
someone who had seen that the assassins were involving themselves in the 
clandestine group&#39;s affairs or at the very least returning to action, 
and as a result had made use of the offered opportunity to try and rub 
them out once and for all. Mireille didn&#39;t know what she and Kirika 
could expect to find in Simon&#39;s abode; Ryosuke and Vincent at large, a 
team of heavily armed Soldats agents lying in wait to ambush them, or 
simply a pimply-faced Simon and his unkempt associate playing inane 
computer games. If it turned out to be the latter, she mused how the 
hacker and Ezza would react when she and her fellow assassin burst in 
with guns drawn and at the ready. Whatever ensued, Simon would probably 
be less enthusiastic in his uncouth overtures towards Mireille 
thereafter.

Yet even if there hadn&#39;t been any doubt that Jacques was in the employ 
of Mireille and her partner&#39;s backer, the woman would still be 
approaching the situation with an exceedingly wary mind. It wasn&#39;t as if 
she trusted Breffort and his men much more than the rest of the detested 
organisation they belonged to. The only person who had the blonde&#39;s 
total faith was the svelte girl silently flanking her at this precise 
second. Any shred of lingering doubt she&#39;d had regarding her colleague&#39;s 
mental state whilst in combat had utterly vanished with the darkhaired 
assassin&#39;s latest performance against Millet and his now eradicated 
syndicate. Kirika had apparently truly returned to her old self again, 
the self that had fought spiritedly alongside her in the Manor months 
ago.

Mireille stopped running and positioned herself with her back against 
the crumbling wall by the computer shop&#39;s door, Kirika mimicking her 
manoeuvre on the opposite side. The assassins&#39; pistols were in their 
hands and fully loaded--lions with their lips rolled back and their 
sharp teeth bared. The silencers that had been affixed to them 
previously were removed now; beyond their preliminary advance, stealth 
wasn&#39;t necessary. This wasn&#39;t an assignment where Mireille and Kirika 
had to get in and out of a target&#39;s neighbourhood without a whisper. 
Besides, once they breached the entryway of Simon&#39;s domicile, there was 
a reasonably good chance they would be propelled immediately into a 
firefight. Entering through the main doorway wasn&#39;t exactly subtle.

As Mireille remained stationary leaning against the wall the cool night 
wind funnelled through the slender alley in a low whistle, as though 
howling in warning of what lay ahead. Meanwhile the woman&#39;s lavender 
coat and long flaxen locks flapped as they rode the chilly currents, 
being pulled away from the doorway as if in an attempt to hold her back, 
the breeze knowing something that the assassin did not. Yet what really 
invoked Mireille&#39;s discomfort was the tart odour that wafted up from her 
own body to irritate her nose courtesy of the draft, the pungent aroma 
reminding her that she probably gave the impression of a boozing drunk 
who had slopped more of her liquor on herself than she had ingested. Her 
clothing was still infused with the biting scent of the litres of 
alcohol that had been spilt on her during her stay behind the bar in 
Millet&#39;s strip club, the reek an unwelcome and seeming unfading memento 
of that occasion. Mireille rather disliked it when her appearance became 
dishevelled, but it often happened in the course of her rigorous 
vocation. While it had no major drawbacks per se, she simply was 
uncomfortable when garbed in dirty clothes or smeared with filth--she 
just didn&#39;t feel like herself. She couldn&#39;t wait until this night ended 
so she could return to the apartment and change out of her soiled 
garments, before showering thoroughly and ridding herself of the bitter 
stench that enveloped her.

Glancing over at Kirika across from her, Mireille briefly wondered if 
the girl could detect the smell. She wouldn&#39;t have been shocked if her 
partner could. Her eyesight and hearing were absolutely exceptional--why 
not her sense of smell on top of that to round off the extraordinary 
bundle?

Suddenly feeling a little more self-conscious about the odour clinging 
to her body than she would have liked, Mireille quickly decided that it 
was time to get the show on the road. Dropping her hand down to the 
dented metal knob attached to the door next to her, she carefully 
grasped the battered grey lump and began to turn it slowly, the 
mechanism emitting only the faintest of squeaks. She was hardly 
surprised when she encountered no resistance. The hour was late and she 
had thought that Simon would have closed his bootlegging business by 
now; that his door was still unlocked imparted credence to the first two 
hypothesises she had envisaged earlier. The prospect of a gunfight 
exploding on the other side of the door had just taken a step up.

Mireille raised her head from the doorknob and favoured Kirika with a 
final glance. The slim girl was a mere vague outline in the jet-black 
alley, almost insubstantial against the shadows surrounding her. It was 
as if the icy gust of wind that had travelled through the passageway 
moments before could have just blown her apart like a dust statue until 
she became impossible to tell apart from the murk, lost in its depths. 
The Corsican couldn&#39;t even hear the withdrawn girl breathe despite their 
relatively close proximity. Oddly, the sight was somewhat unnerving to 
Mireille and she found her glance unexpectedly transform into a 
prolonged stare.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; Kirika whispered, an ephemeral breath of air that gently 
floated to Mireille&#39;s ears.

Mireille instantly snapped out of her trance at the soft, sweet melody 
of Kirika&#39;s voice uttering her name. Correspondingly, her former thought 
was swept to the bottom of the swirling ocean that composed her mind, 
blending into the other currents of the ever-moving sea as new tides 
rose, engulfing it and taking its past place of dominance. By the time 
her partner had spoken the last syllable of her name she had already 
forgotten about the sight of Kirika standing in the dark, and the 
sentiment it had reared.

Mireille didn&#39;t answer Kirika&#39;s query, but instead cautiously pushed 
open the door to the shop with her hand, her mind now focused once again 
on what she and the girl had come here for, all other superfluous 
thoughts banished. She quickly pulled her arm back behind the cover of 
the wall as the door swung open with an audible creak of its hinges, 
lest the exposed limb receive a bullet from any alerted assailant or 
assailants who stood vigilant inside. Light spilled out from the opened 
doorway and into the darkened alley, but the assassins kept out of its 
borders, opting to remain lurking in the shadows while they listened 
intently for any hint of movement inside the building.

After it was clear that no barrage of gunfire was forthcoming, Mireille 
and Kirika both ventured a peek inside Simon&#39;s computer store fa&ccedil;ade, 
poking their heads past the doorjamb just enough to get a decent view of 
the interior. It took only a fraction of a second to realise that the 
room was empty, and appearing much the same as it had during their 
previous visits. But even so, neither Mireille nor Kirika judged the 
area as simply automatically safe to wander into. The images one&#39;s eyes 
afforded to you could be misleading, and to trust them implicitly was to 
dice with Death. Not until they had crossed the threshold and inspected 
every corner of the room could they deem it as clear and subsequently 
treat it as such.

Mireille drew back her head and straightened as Kirika did likewise, the 
young women meeting each other&#39;s gazes. The light escaping from the 
shop&#39;s open doorway touched their faces now, dipping one side in 
brightness while shadows streaked across the other, but bestowing enough 
illumination to lay bare their divergent features and expressions--fair 
and dark, stern and solemn. Yet despite their disparities both assassins 
possessed eyes that glimmered with the same hard resolve; blue and brown 
united in a single purpose.

Mireille lifted her Walther P99 up towards her chest and Kirika raised 
her Beretta M1934 in a similar fashion a second later, their weapons 
glinting dully in their hands. Kirika nodded to the blonde as she cocked 
the hammer of her firearm. They were set.

With that, Mireille dashed into the computer store, her head turning 
sharply to survey the blind spot to the right her initial glimpse inside 
had revealed, while her gun covered the region in front of her. Kirika 
followed in behind the woman an instant later, checking the left hand 
side of the room, her pistol remaining raised but motionless as she let 
her keen eyes scan over dusty shelves and tables laden with obsolete 
technology. It took less than two seconds to verify that the shop fa&ccedil;ade 
indeed did not contain a solitary soul save for the pair who had just 
rushed inside. That left only one other place to investigate.

Noticing that the basement door at the opposite end of the room was 
slightly ajar, Mireille wordlessly signalled to Kirika with a tilt of 
her head that they were proceeding onwards. The slip of a girl nodded 
her understanding, and then they both quietly trotted over to the door, 
each taking up a position on either side of it much like the arrangement 
they had adopted when faced with the alleyway entrance.

Mireille gingerly opened the basement door the rest of the way, and then 
hazarded a look inside. The wooden staircase that led down to the 
underground room where Simon&#39;s true enterprise was housed was as usual 
drenched in gloom, with the customary electric glow of buzzing computer 
monitors bathing a section of concrete floor at the bottom of the steps 
in a puddle of weak, pale light. From her vantage point above, the 
Corsican contract killer couldn&#39;t catch sight of any silhouettes in 
motion breaking what she could make out of the pool of light, but nor 
could she hear the chatting voices of immature teenagers or even the 
rapid tapping of strokes on a keyboard drifting up the stairs. Dead 
silence was all that was presented to her and her partner. It was the 
worst kind of silence.

After inhaling a deep breath to fortify herself--although she in reality 
needed no such bolstering--Mireille slinked through the doorway and 
started to tentatively descend the shadowy basement staircase, wincing 
slightly with every tiny groan the wooden planks made beneath her boots. 
She released the breath she held gradually and inaudibly as she treaded 
softly down the stairs, a calming action to help maintain her strict 
concentration so that she didn&#39;t inadvertently put too much of her 
weight on a step and betray her imminent arrival to any possible armed 
threats lying in wait below her. She sensed Kirika to her rear, but it 
was a purely instinctive awareness; she couldn&#39;t pick up the slightest 
physical sign of movement behind her. The shorter girl was extremely 
light on her feet, as if she walked on air itself, and her composure 
very seldom waned... excluding during special circumstances not unlike 
recent lamentable events, naturally. In spite of her stunted emotional 
development, Kirika&#39;s feelings did seem to govern her general wellbeing 
with considerably greater impunity than most people&#39;s did. Then again, 
perhaps her deficiency in that facet of herself was in fact to blame for 
the strong link. With such limited psychological maturity coupled with a 
subdued personality as a probable product of that, it could be no wonder 
Kirika sometimes reacted to certain things with quite different 
emotional responses than other girls her age did. Whatever the cause of 
the relation, all of this was material about her diminutive counterpart 
that Mireille was already conscious of, and already attempting to 
assuage... if that were possible. Altena&#39;s abuse had certainly inflicted 
considerable mental damage on poor Kirika, damage that may not be 
repairable. Still, Mireille would try.

By the time Mireille and Kirika reached the bottom of the steps, their 
feet hitting concrete, it was readily apparent that the basement 
hideaway of Simon was as devoid of life as the room overhead... but in a 
more literal sense. Once their roaming eyes had ensured that the dim 
light and dark crannies of the vicinity weren&#39;t concealing any enemies 
that had initially eluded their notice, their gazes were immediately 
drawn to the three unmoving bodies sprawled in a likewise number of 
varying positions across the middle of the basement. Mireille recognised 
one of them instantly by the tuft of faded green hair sprouting from the 
top of his head and by his resting place at his desk--Simon, with the 
remaining forms residing in the shadows surrounding him resembling Ezza 
and one of the two teens&#39; seeming acquaintances. It was indisputably 
clear that all of them had met with rather violent, bloody ends.

The blonde woman sighed, relaxing her stance and lowering her gun as it 
dawned on her that she had overlooked a fourth scenario; Ryosuke and 
Vincent long departed but leaving behind Simon and anybody who had been 
with him at the time dead in their wake.

&quot;They&#39;ve gone,&quot; Kirika said as she followed Mireille&#39;s example and let 
her pistol drop to her side, easing the primed hammer of the weapon back 
to rest with her thumb.

&quot;If they were even here at all,&quot; Mireille retorted, although there was 
little doubt in her mind that the basement bloodshed was the false 
Noir&#39;s handiwork. No other possibility made much sense. To her knowledge 
Simon didn&#39;t--or hadn&#39;t, as was the case now--mixed with the type of 
people--barring herself, of course--who would have had the brazenness to 
actually kill him and his associates, even if they&#39;d had what they 
perceived as just motive to do so. The computer expert&#39;s clients had 
been college students and petty felons, not hardcore murderers. The 
Corsican was quite positive Soldats wasn&#39;t responsible either, since she 
didn&#39;t have a clue what the organisation would gain from killing a bunch 
of insignificant juvenile delinquents. That only left one other 
possibility, or more accurately *two*--Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent 
Hsu.

The real question was *why* they had done it. Moreover, why had they 
even troubled themselves with tracking down Simon in the first place? 
Why had they dragged their sorry carcasses out of whatever hole they had 
been hiding in just to find and kill him? Or had they made use of his 
special talents before slaying him? And, most importantly, where were 
Ryosuke and Vincent now?

Mireille bowed her head slightly and shut her eyes for a moment before 
sighing yet again, this time in annoyance. &quot;How bothersome,&quot; she quietly 
remarked to herself. &quot;Let&#39;s hope that they have left more for us than 
just an unsightly mess to sift through,&quot; she then said as she raised her 
head, speaking in a louder voice. &quot;Their trail is getting colder by the 
minute; I&#39;d like to prevent it from becoming as dead as the one at 
Millet&#39;s club apparently was.&quot;

Kirika turned her head to look at Mireille, and out of the corner of the 
blonde&#39;s eye she noticed that her partner&#39;s expression was strangely 
pensive, her mouth opening partly as if she wished to say something. But 
then a second later the introverted girl turned her gaze back to the 
three corpses in front of them and she nodded in acquiesce, a murmur of 
acknowledgement accompanying the gesture.

Mireille and Kirika walked deeper into the circle of feeble light 
emanating from the computer monitors, their pistols staying securely in 
their grips for safety&#39;s sake. They past by Simon&#39;s display tables 
packed with pirate CDs that were still neatly arranged in rows, 
untouched--further evidence that this had not been a robbery or anything 
of the like; it had been an execution. The woman with her partner in tow 
proceeded to the body that stood out the most, despite only lying 
partially in the light.

The corpse stretched out flat on its back off to the right of the 
network of computers was of Simon and Ezza&#39;s unknown acquaintance--a 
shabbily dressed male in his teenage years--and his cause of death was 
clearly identifiable. What remained of the boy was reclining in the vast 
majority of his body&#39;s own spilt blood, the source of which was the 
multiple gunshot wounds to his chest and a single one to the thigh. The 
body was quite frankly a gory ruin, a portrayal of overkill at its most 
gruesome. Whoever had carried out the murder had evidently revelled in 
the brutality of it. A stone cold killer they were not; this was the 
work of enthusiasm, zeal. The traits of an archetypical homicidal 
maniac.

&quot;9mm casings,&quot; Kirika observed from beside Mireille, where the pair were 
situated a sensible foot away from the prolific blood splatters staining 
the floor. She pointed to a cluster of copper coloured hollow cylinders 
scattered about in the red pool, bathing in the result of their lethal 
payloads.

&quot;Evidence of one half of our warped &#39;reflections&#39; past presence here, 
perhaps,&quot; Mireille noted, recalling that one of their target&#39;s weapons 
of choice were two Beretta M92F Elites, which took 9mm ammunition. Yet 
it wasn&#39;t as if it were the sole model of gun that used such a bullet 
type. The calibre had a widespread utilisation across numerous makes of 
firearms all over the world. Nevertheless, when tied together with 
Jacques&#39; alleged message from Breffort that had advised Mireille and 
Kirika to come here, the ejected casings were in support of the false 
Noir&#39;s involvement in Simon and his associates&#39; deaths. Vincent, the 
wielder of the Elites, almost irrefutably held claim to this particular 
victim. A homicidal maniac indeed.

&quot;The concrete walls must have muffled the shots,&quot; Mireille presumed as 
she looked up from the cadaver at the black ceiling above. Nonetheless, 
she didn&#39;t believe anyone would have come to the hacker&#39;s and his 
colleagues&#39; rescue even if they had heard the gunfire. This 
neighbourhood was known for its problematic crime rate, and the 
occasional crack of a gun discharging was like the crowing of birds to 
the locals, simply an everyday background noise. &quot;Vincent obviously 
relished his free reign,&quot; the blonde assassin continued as she returned 
her gaze to the body of the slain adolescent. &quot;But at least we can 
expect that the authorities won&#39;t be turning up on the scene any time 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika concurred, nodding while her eyes remained affixed to the 
corpse.

Mireille shifted her attention to the dead boy&#39;s face, it red and 
swollen, seemingly having been battered rather severely before his 
demise. His identity was foreign to her, not that she really paid much 
heed to every one of Simon&#39;s childish acquaintances she encountered. The 
Corsican mused who he had been to the hacker, however. A late customer? 
A so-called friend? A contact?

Mireille exhaled slowly, her ice blue eyes narrowing and a frown 
creasing her brow; her expression hardening as the sentiments borne from 
her being a professional killer for years came to fore. Did it really 
matter who the victim had been? He was dead and gone, and she didn&#39;t 
have the time to spare for baseless speculation on his personal history. 
The longer she and Kirika lingered the further Ryosuke and Vincent 
slipped through their fingers. Mireille sought to clench their fist 
tightly around the men tonight if she could, and crush them in it. But 
that would be unlikely to occur without knowing their current 
whereabouts. She prayed that the false Noir had left behind some sort of 
pointer as to where they had headed next, yet it would be the product of 
sloppiness on their part if they had. And as could be imagined the idea 
of Ryosuke and Vincent--who, from what the Corsican had seen, were very 
able killers--being careless was an implausible one. Still, everybody 
regardless of how skilled they were made a mistake sooner or later. With 
any luck, this night had been the instant that Mireille and Kirika&#39;s 
quarry had slipped up.

Mireille looked over her shoulder at the L-shaped desk and the body 
slumped upon it to the rear of her and colleague, her countenance 
becoming a tad grimmer. She then briskly strode towards Simon without 
hesitation, Kirika lagging behind her.

As soon as Mireille had entered the basement and witnessed the carnage, 
she had known that Simon was dead. He was hunched forwards in his chair, 
collapsed over one of his keyboards, the back of his head coloured with 
a thick dark red pigment that clashed garishly with the green dye 
tinting the rest of his brown hair. More of the crimson colorant oozed 
down the hacker&#39;s cheeks and had collected in the groves between the 
keys of the keyboard, while a large amount had been splattered against a 
smashed computer monitor&#39;s screen, droplets dripping lazily from the 
jagged glass. Simon had taken a bullet to the back of the head, a 
classic execution. The shot must have been fired at close range, too, 
the round evidently having passed straight through his skull to shatter 
the monitor screen in front of him.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s voice from close beside her startled Mireille a bit, the 
woman&#39;s shoulders jerking slightly as she was jolted out of a stare she 
hadn&#39;t realised she had been entranced in. She looked away from the 
corpse of Simon to her partner&#39;s sombre face, a single blonde eyebrow 
raised in puzzlement on an expression that had somewhere along the line 
softened.

&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Mireille said as though it were obvious, favouring 
Kirika with a perplexed look. She then frowned, looking at the girl 
askance. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I be?&quot;

Kirika lowered her head, her eyes shifting to Simon&#39;s remains. &quot;I&#39;d only 
met him a few times, but he was your friend,&quot; she said quietly, before 
she lifted her head to look up at Mireille woefully. &quot;You knew him....&quot;

Mireille merely blinked at Kirika for a couple of moments as she tried 
to wrap her mind around what the feeling-hearted girl was getting at. 
When she finally succeeded, her frown disappeared as she regarded her 
partner with mild bemusement. &quot;I may have known him, but it wasn&#39;t as if 
we were friends,&quot; she explained. She turned her head back to the 
teenager whose know-how in computer network security she had sometimes 
taken advantage of... and never would be able to again. &quot;He was nothing 
more than a....&quot; Her visage hardened yet again, the harsh, cold mask her 
sort often donned fitting once more over her face. &quot;...Than an 
acquaintance.&quot;

An acquaintance. A contact. A source. Mireille had sadly learnt early in 
her life as a contract killer that it was wisest to keep your business 
associates as strictly that; they were solely individuals you conducted 
transactions with, nothing more. The relationship between all parties 
should idyllically be as dry as possible... and not only for the obvious 
security precautions. If one strayed from that paradigm, all that 
awaited her or him was unnecessary pain and guilt, anguish that could 
have been avoided. An assassin whose heart contained even the slightest 
speck of compassion couldn&#39;t afford to have friends, only acquaintances. 
Friends die, but acquaintances merely... drifted apart from you. An 
assassin&#39;s heart had to be hard, an unfeeling lump of rock supplanting 
the fragile, easily bruised organ in their chest. There was no other 
means to stomach the job.

Yet even the stoniest of hearts had its fissures. No matter how strong 
the shell one encases their heart in, certain people have a way of 
weeding beyond it and into the soft centre it had been trying to 
protect. Acquaintances could become friends before one even realised it, 
and by then it was too late--the heart does not let go easily. It&#39;s good 
while it lasts--friends help share the burden of one&#39;s life, and for an 
assassin that life&#39;s burdens are weighty indeed. But friends are akin to 
a ticking time bomb, or perhaps an addictive drug that eventually runs 
out. There sooner or later comes a day when your very relationship with 
them results in their premature fall into a grave, and then when the 
grief and guilt arrive afterwards it&#39;s almost overwhelming. It&#39;s better 
to prevent the friendship from the onset, before your heart is wounded. 
In Mireille&#39;s experience the wounds of the heart tended to cut the 
deepest. Needless to say, the woman had very few friends. Most of the 
ones she&#39;d had were dead now, and she wasn&#39;t looking to replace them.

And besides she had Kirika, quite possibly the greatest example of how 
someone can surreptitiously delve into a frozen heart while it remained 
utterly oblivious to the incursion, and to its subtle defrosting that 
ensued. However Kirika was a special circumstance. She was an assassin 
like Mireille, a partner in arms who trudged along the black path in 
unison with the woman. Kirika knew the danger, but unlike Mireille&#39;s now 
dirt-napping friends, she had *lived* the danger and was still living it 
to this day. The quiet girl understood the score like no outsider could, 
and moreover possessed the expertise in the art of murder to survive it. 
The blonde could rest assured that Kirika would never follow in her late 
friends&#39; footsteps and succumb to the perils of her--of 
their--unforgiving existence... or at least not easily, and not without 
Mireille having anything to do about it. With that--albeit slightly 
tentative--assurance, the woman could permit herself to maintain her 
present level of closeness to her partner with the prospect of 
furthering it, free of the usual apprehension that came with bonding to 
people who were strangers to the trade. It could be said that Kirika was 
Mireille&#39;s ideal friend, the only kind of companion truly suited to the 
Corsican&#39;s hazardous lifestyle. But the girl far outshined any friend 
she&#39;d ever had. Kirika had become more significant to the blonde than a 
thousand friends for she had touched the woman&#39;s heart in a way like no 
other, exposing her to feelings she&#39;d never experienced before, emotions 
that were different than those of friendship, which appeared as mundane 
alongside them. She had never believed there would be any place for love 
in her life apart from the empty physical kind, and yet here it was, 
standing beside her at this exact moment in the inconspicuous form of a 
teenage Japanese girl... who held a gun. Maybe, as in friendship, only a 
fellow assassin had the capability to claim Mireille&#39;s frequently 
standoffish heart. Or perhaps only Kirika herself could, the woman&#39;s 
&#39;fated&#39; other half. When she thought about it, Mireille couldn&#39;t 
envision herself feeling the same way for anybody else; Kirika was 
unique, and her heart could accept no one else, as though it had been 
made precisely to match up with the girl&#39;s. Quite possibly the legend of 
Noir had some truth behind it after all.

Mireille looked back at the departed Simon and at what he had been 
reduced to--a murder victim in his own home, simply another fatality in 
a bad neighbourhood--and found it a struggle to preserve her aloof 
stance she laboured to adhere to. Slivers of guilt began to coil around 
her heart, squeezing it and endeavouring to rupture its cool armour. An 
acquaintance the hacker may have been, and a grating one at that, but 
even Mireille knew deep down inside that he hadn&#39;t deserved an ending 
like this. Part of her--the callous part, the part that she had 
cultivated during her existence as an assassin--said that he had been 
aware of the risks, that he had been aware of the shady and potentially 
dangerous business he had chosen to involve himself in. She should not 
feel guilty when he had brought Death upon himself.

However he *hadn&#39;t* been aware of the risks, not the ones that had led 
to him receiving a bullet in the brain anyway. Mireille had neglected to 
enlighten the teenager to the threat the men she&#39;d had him search for 
posed, opting to keep the degree of information he was privy to on a 
need to know basis, as was a normal practice of hers. But if she had 
relented, maybe Simon would have exercised more caution and then he and 
his associates would be alive and well right now instead of lying around 
slaughtered in a dismal basement of a ramshackle slum. The only vaguely 
plausible motive the Corsican had been able to come up with thus far for 
Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s visit to and execution of Simon and his cohorts 
was that by some miracle one member of the hacker&#39;s professed network of 
informants he was apparently able to utilise--likely the mystery youth 
whom had been shot repeatedly in the chest a short distance from the 
desk--had stumbled upon the two hitmen&#39;s new accommodations. There, the 
men had noticed him before he unknowingly led them to the computer 
store, where in a lethal fashion the pair had proceeded to show him, his 
employer, and Ezza their displeasure at being watched. If this depiction 
of what had taken place here was accurate, even somewhat, then the 
blonde&#39;s guilt may be justified.

Yet on the other hand even if Mireille had informed Simon of the danger, 
she suspected it wouldn&#39;t have changed the grisly outcome at all, 
barring the case where the hacker turned down the assignment out of 
fear. His informants&#39; hunting methods were probably as slipshod as the 
come, and when up against skilled individuals such as the false Noir, 
the chances of their scrutiny--even if it only lasted for an 
instance--being detected was high indeed. On top of all that, Simon&#39;s 
traditional enthusiasm in pleasing Mireille probably hadn&#39;t helped the 
situation either. Too much eagerness can foster carelessness, and when 
coupled with the hacker&#39;s already lax snitches, it made for a surefire 
treacherous mix.

But then there was Simon and his acquaintances&#39; ages. They were young, 
Simon not much older than Kirika, while the presumed informant might 
even have been of comparable age to her. The fact that they&#39;d had their 
lives snuffed out so early on was what mainly provoked the guilt that 
strived to slither into Mireille&#39;s heart. That, and because they were so 
close to her partner&#39;s age bracket--she didn&#39;t enjoy being reminded of 
Kirika&#39;s mortality, peerless combat prowess or no. Regardless of 
someone&#39;s age--be they a child, adolescent, adult, or older--none were 
exempt from possibly becoming a victim, from possibly becoming prey for 
the predators that walked this earth. The black path paved its road with 
countless victims, and not all were travellers of its dark route.

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika mumbled uncertainly at Mireille&#39;s clarification, still 
looking up at the woman with doleful eyes. &quot;But--&quot;

&quot;We shouldn&#39;t dawdle,&quot; Mireille interrupted rather firmly, marching past 
Kirika towards Ezza&#39;s body as the lithe girl turned after her, her mouth 
open but her words prematurely silenced by her partner&#39;s frank 
brush-off. The blonde knew that she was being abrasive to the one person 
that should be spared such treatment, but the atmosphere of the murky 
basement was beginning to feel oppressive. The stench of Death hung in 
the air, a gradually rising, gradually gathering scent that seemed to 
slowly smother her from all sides. The odour was normally not something 
that bothered her, and yet.... The moment when Mireille left this... 
this *tomb* and breathed in the fresh night air outside couldn&#39;t come 
soon enough for her.

Mireille briskly treaded across the room while Kirika trailed after her, 
putting the computers on the desk and their lifeless operator to her 
back. Ezza&#39;s corpse was ahead of her, slouched against a wall and shaded 
in the darkness, his form indistinct where it sat outside the light, 
almost swallowed up completely in the gloom. As the Corsican assassin 
stepped out of the puddle of monitor glow to join the carcass in the 
shadows, she felt something strike the toe of her boot, a rasp coming 
from the floor. Pausing, she looked down and noticed what resembled a 
mobile phone at her feet. It appeared to be a very expensive model, the 
kind that could acquire a signal practically anywhere and had peripheral 
functions galore. Mireille found it odd that Simon had had the funds to 
pay for such a pricey device, but then he had been able purchase and 
maintain a top of range network of computers; perhaps he had diverted 
some of his cash from their upgrades for the phone. However it had got 
there, it was nothing more than a paperweight now. The mobile phone was 
severely mangled; its black plastic casing split and twisted, exposing a 
cracked circuit board with crushed microchips inside.

&quot;Maybe they tried to call for help,&quot; Kirika suggested as she halted 
slightly behind Mireille, also looking upon the smashed communications 
device that had waylaid the blonde.

&quot;If they had, then whoever killed them didn&#39;t take kindly to it,&quot; 
Mireille replied, picturing Ryosuke or Vincent viciously stomping on the 
mobile phone and its unfortunate user&#39;s hand with it.

Moving onwards, Mireille and Kirika approached Ezza, arranging 
themselves on either side of his still body. He sat with his back 
against the wall, his legs straightened out in front of him... or one of 
them at any rate. His left leg was bent at an unnatural angle below the 
knee, the joint ruined by most likely a gunshot, or by an extremely 
brutal blow with a heavy object that had ruptured the flesh and 
dislocated it.

Sighting no other external wounds below his neck, Mireille shifted her 
gaze higher, settling it on Ezza&#39;s head. The youth&#39;s chin rested on his 
chest, his lank hair drooping downwards in greasy waves and obscuring 
his face from view. Pressing the barrel of her Walther gingerly against 
his forehead, Mireille carefully tilted his head back upright, and 
revealed what she had already guessed was there--the mortal injury that 
had resulted in his death. But this injury was no mere bullet to the 
brow; this was on par with a concentrated shotgun blast directly to the 
face. The woman involuntarily found herself grimacing in revulsion at 
the hideous mess of dripping blood and shredded flesh Ezza&#39;s visage had 
been turned into. A single gory yet visible hole tunnelled through the 
centre of his disfigured countenance; a bullet wound, but most 
definitely one created by a powerful pistol. Yet Mireille had never seen 
an entry wound of this ferocity caused by anything other than rifles; 
even handguns of the .357 class fell short of achieving this effect.

&quot;A high calibre round,&quot; Kirika said softly, her opinions on the same 
vein as her partner&#39;s. &quot;At extreme close range.&quot;

Mireille merely muttered her agreement and let Ezza&#39;s head drop back to 
its former position. As she did, she glimpsed something that had escaped 
her notice previously--the hair at the back of his head was matted and 
appeared wet; the shot to his face had passed entirely through his 
skull. A hand&#39;s breadth splash of blood soiled the concrete behind 
Ezza&#39;s head where the bullet had delivered the fluid with its exit; only 
now that Mireille&#39;s eyes had adjusted to the darkness could she discern 
the telling stain. Her keener gaze additionally picked up a gouge in the 
wall nestled in the discharged blood that enclosed it--the hollow where 
the fired slug had burrowed deeply into the solid concrete. Truly a 
powerful pistol.

Mireille&#39;s scowl intensified as she turned around to face the centre of 
the basement. There were no clues here, no signs to direct her and 
Kirika to the next segment of Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s trail. No slip-ups, 
just bodies, corpses of boys who had died much too young. The false 
Noir--false as they may be--evidently possessed enough talent and 
prudence not to leave any tracks behind that could be traced.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing,&quot; Mireille said with clear displeasure, voicing her 
beliefs... and concerns. She feared the trail had been ice cold before 
she and Kirika had even shown up.

&quot;Mm...&quot; Kirika murmured unhappily, bowing her head and looking down at 
the floor. But then a moment later her head suddenly snapped up and she 
blinked, before turning to favour Mireille with a somewhat enlivened 
expression. &quot;The video camera,&quot; she said a little breathlessly.

A still frowning yet curious Mireille turned her head to Kirika, the 
Corsican assassin wondering what had gotten the quiet girl worked up. 
She merely blinked at her partner&#39;s hopeful face for a second as Kirika 
simply looked back at her, before it finally sunk in. The video camera. 
Of course! Simon kept his basement abode under surveillance!

Mireille gasped in realisation, her scowl vanishing, and--with Kirika 
accompanying her--hurried back to the desk, searching among the monitors 
for the unique one that displayed the output of the camera mounted 
covertly in one dark corner of the room. &quot;Let&#39;s hope that he actually 
recorded the feed,&quot; she said as her eyes scanned anxiously over the 
cluster of screens while she wracked her brains, trying to recall its 
position. During her hunt she noticed that one of Simon&#39;s PC towers had 
a couple of bullet holes marring its front, the blemishes just above the 
floppy disk drive. It was peculiar since she didn&#39;t believe that the 
false Noir&#39;s shots would miss their marks while up against trapped and 
unarmed teenagers. Maybe it was for intimidation reasons.

Following a handful of seconds spent looking for it Mireille located the 
video camera&#39;s monitor, its television-like exterior betraying the 
different purpose it had to its mates. Like a few other screens it was 
switched off, a black square that could easily be overlooked in the dim 
light as Ryosuke and Vincent had apparently done together with missing 
the camera. The blonde assassin didn&#39;t know why the monitor wasn&#39;t on, 
but whatever the grounds it had worked in her and Kirika&#39;s favour. That 
is, if the camera it was connected to wasn&#39;t switched off as well.

Not willing to wait any longer to find out, Mireille switched on the 
monitor. It flared to life, and presented the welcome black and white 
image of her and her partner standing in front of the computer desk, the 
basement stairs at the top of the screen behind the figures. Despite the 
lack of colour the picture was exceedingly clear; Simon had seemingly 
opted for a camera and monitor that both operated at a high resolution, 
perhaps even forgoing traditional cassette tape for a purely digital 
recording medium.

There were controls to directly manipulate the picture on the monitor 
below the screen that supported the digital theory and which Mireille 
used to attempt to rewind the recording to the time when Simon and his 
cohorts have been paid a deadly visit. To her relief, an animated time 
selection slider bar appeared on the screen that through the controls 
allowed her to replay the recorded events that had taken place in the 
basement before she and Kirika had arrived, and in turn shed some light 
on exactly what had happened.

The position of the camera only captured a small section of the 
basement, but it was enough to grant Mireille and Kirika a general idea 
of how Simon, Ezza, and the other juvenile had been slain. Jacques had 
evidently been working for Breffort after all; Ryosuke and Vincent had 
indeed come to the computer shop and were responsible for its young 
occupants&#39; murders. Nearly everyone remained partly or totally off 
screen for the most part, with the sole exceptions of Ryosuke and Simon, 
the former of which mainly stood like statue a couple of feet from the 
staircase while the latter sat at the desk. While the hacker&#39;s abuse and 
subsequent execution by Vincent had been recorded in graphic detail--the 
only death to be--their was only two things that interested Mireille; 
what Ryosuke had said to him shortly before his demise that&#39;d had him 
nodding his head in fervent compliance, and who had phoned the hitman to 
seemingly prompt him to speak to the youth. Unfortunately, there was no 
sound mixed in with the pictures of the recording, leaving the Corsican 
and her partner pretty much out of luck.

&quot;He... he wants an address,&quot; Kirika told Mireille out of the blue in a 
hesitant voice, her eyes riveted to the monitor as the woman repeated 
the part of the recording where Ryosuke spoke to Simon.

Mireille paused the playing images to look at the withdrawn girl in 
surprise. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; she asked, her voice and expression 
both quizzical.

&quot;That is what he said,&quot; Kirika expounded, turning her head from the 
screen to return her partner&#39;s thrown look with her typical sober 
countenance. &quot;The way his mouth moves.&quot;

Mireille blinked languidly at Kirika--her expression rather 
astonished--and then glanced at the monitor, before turning her head 
back to her counterpart once again. &quot;You mean to say you read his lips?&quot; 
she eventually said in amazement, staring incredulously at her partner 
as the unassuming girl simply stared back at her. &quot;That you can read 
lips?&quot;

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika emitted with a nod, as if she were merely confirming that 
she could skip or do something equally routine, rather than perform a 
pretty impressive feat.

Mireille closed her eyes as she shook her head gently in bewilderment, 
the corners of her mouth twitching upwards in the beginnings of a 
pleasantly surprised smile. So Kirika could read lips. The woman 
half-jokingly wondered if that applied to every language she spoke... 
but knowing Kirika, it probably did. She was an unassuming girl indeed. 
The Corsican assassin could see the handiness of having such a gift, as 
Altena no doubt had too. Being able to know what guards, 
targets--anybody really--were speaking of from a distance could privy 
one to useful intel... much like in this precise situation.

&quot;You certainly are a deceptive package,&quot; Mireille declared with as much 
wryness as she could muster given their grim surroundings. She opened 
her eyes and smiled faintly at Kirika, her expression remarkably tender 
in relation to its past harsh appearance. &quot;But I suppose I was already 
cognisant of that,&quot; she then added a little playfully, angling her head 
to look at the girl sidelong, the smile remaining on her lips. &quot;Still 
full of surprises, even now.&quot;

Kirika lowered her head slightly at Mireille&#39;s words, dropping her gaze 
from the blonde. Mireille smirked a little at the reaction--she just 
might have embarrassed the introverted girl. While she hadn&#39;t known her 
reserved counterpart to ever openly blush--although the woman did hold 
onto the hope that one day she would witness the no doubt *very* cute 
action--Kirika did have her own endearing ways of displaying her 
discomfit that the Corsican had identified and hence could normally 
spot, as in this case. Yet on this occasion the girl&#39;s face somehow 
seemed sadder than it had a few moments ago. Mireille chalked it up to a 
trick of the meagre light; she was quite sure she hadn&#39;t said anything 
that Kirika could have construed the wrong way.

Mireille&#39;s visage reverted back to its former serious guise--warm to 
cold--as she refocused her attention on the video camera&#39;s monitor, her 
and her partner&#39;s fleeting interlude of light-heartedness over. After 
all, it was difficult to be cheerful when in the presence of corpses who 
had once been people you knew.

&quot;Can you make out the address he wants?&quot; Mireille posed to Kirika as she 
restarted the recording. Her eyes flicked to the two bullet holes in one 
of the computer towers standing upright on the desk, now understanding 
the full story behind the punctures. Although the camera had captured 
Vincent firing the rounds just before he and his colleague had departed 
the basement--dismissing the notion that they had been stray shots--the 
blonde hadn&#39;t known why he had done so. But with the recent information 
of Ryosuke desiring Simon to dig up an address for him, it now all made 
sense--the shots were to destroy the evidence resident in the hard disk 
of the computer used to find the address, and in turn hide any trace of 
his and Vincent&#39;s visit while also preventing anyone from tailing them. 
However, they obviously hadn&#39;t counted on the sharp young Japanese girl 
at Mireille&#39;s side.

Kirika looked up and turned to the monitor, studying its high-resolution 
screen intently for a couple of minutes as the logged scenes played out. 
She then shook her head. &quot;He never says it. But he does say somebody&#39;s 
name,&quot; she notified the blonde. Kirika&#39;s brow furrowed in concentration 
as she closely scrutinised the image of Ryosuke&#39;s moving lips as they 
noiselessly formed words, the girl frequently requesting Mireille to 
repeat one portion of the recording which the woman dutifully did.

&quot;Al... Albe... Al... ber... bert. Albert...&quot; Kirika mumbled softly to 
herself as Mireille watched on in fascination tempered somewhat by her 
current dark mood, the woman&#39;s fingers moving automatically on the 
monitor&#39;s controls to replay the segment of footage, her mind all but 
wholly captivated by her petite partner. She scarcely drew breath lest 
she disturb the girl&#39;s focus; people&#39;s names were apparently trickier to 
read from lip movements alone than general words.

&quot;Lar... o... Laro... ka? Laro... Laro... que. Laroque.&quot; Kirika turned 
her head to Mireille, the said blonde regarding her slightly 
uncertainly. &quot;Albert Laroque,&quot; she then stated simply, her 
reconstruction of every silent syllable of the name uttered by Ryosuke 
complete.

&quot;Albert Laroque?&quot; Mireille echoed, knitting her brow. The name didn&#39;t 
ring any bells, but she trusted Kirika&#39;s conclusions implicitly. The 
notion that perhaps the darkhaired girl had mispronounced the name 
didn&#39;t even enter her mind.

Abandoning her efforts to try and remember if she were familiar with 
&#39;Albert Laroque&#39;, Mireille instead let her hard mask slip again for a 
second and cast a small, fond smile Kirika&#39;s way in a gesture of 
approval. &quot;Well done,&quot; she praised quietly, although the girl merely 
responded with her usual impassive look; her version of dismissively 
shrugging one&#39;s shoulders, the blonde thought wryly. &quot;What about his 
phone call? Can you tell what he says?&quot; she then asked as she rewound 
the recording to that exact part.

Kirika shook her head as she regretfully murmured in the negative. &quot;He 
doesn&#39;t move his lips enough,&quot; she said. &quot;But I think he&#39;s speaking 
Japanese,&quot; she then helpfully offered instead.

Mireille absently nodded. The phone call wasn&#39;t really relevant anymore; 
she and Kirika had already found the elusive breadcrumb that revealed 
the next branch of the false Noir&#39;s trail. And it came in the form of a 
name--Albert Laroque. Simon&#39;s and his colleagues&#39; murders had clearly 
not been without gain after all; even in death the hacker had provided 
valuable information, just like a well-paid contact--a well-paid 
acquaintance--should.

&quot;We&#39;re finished here,&quot; Mireille announced unfeelingly, more to the air 
than to her partner. She then walked away from the L-shaped desk in the 
direction of the basement stairs, Kirika obediently at her heels.

When she reached the bottom of the steps, Mireille abruptly stopped and 
looked back over her shoulder, bringing up her pistol in the same 
motion. Aiming for the video camera&#39;s monitor, she squeezed the trigger 
of the Walther and destroyed it with a single shot, before unleashing 
the remainder of the weapon&#39;s magazine into rest of Simon&#39;s computer 
equipment, making certain it was all damaged beyond repair. Mireille and 
Kirika would leave here without a trace, unlike their warped other 
halves. The blonde&#39;s bullet casings were unmarked, and the fingerprints 
she and her partner had left behind weren&#39;t an issue--to the Corsican&#39;s 
knowledge neither hers nor her Japanese counterpart&#39;s existed in any 
record anywhere in the world, let alone in Paris&#39; metropolitan Police 
department&#39;s databases. Mireille&#39;s history was as clean as they come 
which had consequently never warranted her fingerprints to ever be 
taken, while Kirika was more or less a ghost existing outside of 
society&#39;s radar. Yet, come to think of it, Kirika hadn&#39;t touched a 
solitary object in the building so far. Mireille had neglected to notice 
that until just now, a credit to the girl&#39;s subtlety and skill as an 
assassin.

Mireille ejected the empty clip from her gun and placed it in one of the 
ammunition pouches on the harness strapped under her coat, before 
reloading. She then resumed her exodus of the basement, climbing up the 
creaky wooden stairs and making no attempt to mitigate the noise of her 
footsteps. Kirika&#39;s own ascension of the staircase was still hushed 
however, maintaining stealth likely an unconscious act for the talented 
girl.

Mireille pulled out her mobile phone from her coat&#39;s inside pocket with 
her free hand, and begun dialling the number for one of her many sources 
who could ascertain the address of Albert Laroque; the address where 
Ryosuke and Vincent were doubtless at this very minute. Time was still 
of the essence; the Corsican didn&#39;t want to miss the two men and end up 
chasing them around fruitlessly until morning, one step behind. She 
wanted to end this &#39;assignment&#39; of Breffort&#39;s tonight, end her and her 
partner&#39;s relation with him and Soldats for good. She wanted her and 
Kirika to be utterly free of the organisation forever and simply live 
their lives in blessed privacy together. It was all within grasp 
tonight, within Mireille&#39;s tightening fist. She imagined she should be 
thankful to Simon for his sacrifice; quite possibly his last service to 
her was the greatest.

But despite that, as she strode up the stairs to street level she didn&#39;t 
so much as cast a last look back into the dark basement that had become 
Simon and his associates&#39; grave. After all, Simon had merely been an 
acquaintance of hers... and they had drifted apart.
