school have been changed to Kawasaki. The Ishinomori birthplaces and the 
location of their headquarters have been changed to Yokohama mainly for 
the sake of a smoother plot. All chapters have been revised to reflect 
this change. It&#39;s nothing too major; basically, all references to Kyoto 
have been replaced with references to Yokohama. Thanks to Chadwick for

Looking Beyond The Horizon


Breffort paused just outside the door; a solid hulk of oak with simple 
yet regal designs hailing from the old-world carved directly into the 
mass of wood; and adjusted the broad knot of his slate-grey necktie at 
his throat. It was an unnecessary gesture; one that he was reluctantly 
aware was birthed out of a desire to linger in the dimly lit antechamber 
for a few moments longer. And out of an irrational sense that his tie 
was coming dangerously close to throttling him.

It was always the same when he stood in front of this door, stood 
wearing these clothes. The forest green suit jacket felt outlandish on 
him, constricting, its straight cut stiff collar prickling his neck. The 
accompanying white shirt was no improvement, its collar a tight band 
around his throat. Perhaps it was the shirt&#39;s collar that was 
responsible for the sensation of having a restricted windpipe. Indeed, 
his sedate necktie was the only part of his dress that reflected who he 
really was.

The rest were clothes of an antiquated cut, trappings from the past, but 
the formal and expected attire for one such as he. Breffort always tried 
to think of them as the equivalent of ceremonial robes merely signifying 
his station, a station that led beyond that door, and nothing more. But 
the attire also signified the aspect of that station he despised above 
all. Despised above all, yet which was obligatory nonetheless, 
irrespective of how much and how often he endeavoured to shirk it. His 
absence had been too long as it was, until a few months prior at any 
rate, and besides, he needed to be here in person for this. There were 
some things that couldn&#39;t be done unless face-to-face with those 
involved, or rather, *shouldn&#39;t* be done. Things where observing facial 
expression and body language closely were key factors vital to base 
further planning on, which would then lead to eventual success. And 
continued survival.

Smothering his discomfort with a force of will keen at the struggle 
against emotion, Breffort opened the door he faced without further 
hesitation and stepped into the room it protected, his expression and 
hobbled gait exhibiting all the impassiveness and nonchalance 
expected--nay, required--of a member of Soldats&#39; chief ruling council. 
He entered without knocking, but the four middle-aged men gathered in 
the sitting room were not offended nor caught off guard by his 
appearance, or if they were, they didn&#39;t show it save for a subtle 
shifting of heads and eyes to regard him. They, like Breffort, were of 
the same breed. Furthermore, his arrival had been expected. His 
tardiness on the other hand, was assumed.

It was here in this room where all the strings of all the puppets 
eventually ended, the reins of a bridled world, reins held and steered 
by the men seated in a semicircle around the blazing fireplace set into 
the right-hand wall. The men beyond the looking glass, the 
puppet-masters behind the curtain. Countless people&#39;s fates had been 
decided in this room; the destiny of nations; the future of the globe. 
Breffort closed the door and moved to take his place among those who 
controlled the workings of the world from the shadows.

He was, as usual when he did grace the council with his presence, the 
last member to arrive. His peers wordlessly and emotionlessly watched 
him settle into the only remaining empty armchair by the fire, the 
second from the left--his chair. There had been a long stretch when 
Breffort&#39;s chair had been missing from the arc, his deliberate and 
lengthy non-attendance of council meetings prompting his fellows to 
eventually remove it outright. It wasn&#39;t until shortly after the turmoil 
with Ishinomori arose when he had he at last returned to take part in 
the occasional conference... although his loathing of them still 
endured. His being here this evening, like on the previous evenings he 
had elected to join his cohorts, was purely out of a strategic need to 
be. If he could have avoided it, he most certainly would have.

Instead of sitting about in a gloomy, secluded room wasting valuable 
time discussing affairs that did not need to be discussed in person, or 
in many cases at all by Soldats&#39; ruling council, he preferred to take a 
more active role in the society he secretly influenced; to actually *be* 
in the thick of those affairs. He believed his more direct involvement 
made him a better adjudicator of how those affairs should properly be 
handled, leagues better than his fellow councilmen who had distanced 
themselves too greatly from the people they clandestinely governed and 
the world they surreptitiously moulded. For too long had Breffort&#39;s 
contemporaries isolated themselves by restricting their participation in 
Soldats concerns to council assemblies, pulling the marionettes&#39; strings 
from as far away as they could, relying on the organisation&#39;s network of 
underlings&#39; reports to give them a semblance of a view of the world 
outside their cushioned mansions and estates. Breffort knew none were 
like him; none ventured from their lofty thrones on the uppermost 
echelons of Soldats hierarchy to scrutinise the ever-changing currents 
of civilisation. A mistake. As a result of their segregation they all 
looked to Breffort when the council needed representation in the world; 
he was the face of Soldats&#39; nobility, posing as their avatar, relaying 
their commands to those arrayed below--it was the reason why they 
tolerated his frequent absence from meetings, or at least, did not 
outwardly call him down on them.

Breffort did not balk at having been saddled with such a role; indeed, 
in his opinion it was a favourable position to be in, perhaps even the 
most ideal. In the eyes of his and the council&#39;s subordinates it was 
Breffort they considered to be leader of Soldats; the council themselves 
were but a faceless, mysterious group to them that some circulating 
rumours proclaimed did not even really exist. And the belief that 
Breffort single-handedly presided over Soldats, while not quite 
completely erroneous, brought respect and power--respect and power 
Breffort gladly accepted as his due right.

The cost of this notoriety and authority wasn&#39;t him becoming a lackey to 
his peers on the council, however. Far from it. He had a seat and thus 
was their equal, or so was the general conception. But whatever the rest 
of the council thought, Breffort knew he surpassed them. He was the 
architect of Soldats plots, the coordinator of the smoke and mirrors. 
All the intelligence from all of Soldats&#39; sources eventually found its 
way to him, flowing between the myriad of nodes placed across the Earth 
until reaching his, the pinnacle of the erratic web-like pyramid; 
intelligence from the organisation&#39;s innumerable agents, and 
intelligence from the council itself. He was privy to all, ignorant of 
nothing. His position saw to that. It was Breffort who *truly* had the 
power of Soldats at his fingertips, and through it, manipulated the 
world at his whim. Let his colleagues think they had him at their beck 
and call, equals or not. It did not matter. He knew his place, knew it 
well, and they could not compete.

Still, it was with awkwardness that Breffort sank into the dark 
upholstery of the vacant armchair, awkwardness not triggered by the 
twinges running up his right leg from his old injury. The chair didn&#39;t 
fit any better than the clothes he was duty-bound to wear.

Breffort propped his cane against an arm of the chair, and made as if he 
was relaxing back against its cushions although the stiffness never left 
his shoulders, the tension never left his throat. But putting on airs of 
indifference was a must in his current company; to do otherwise would 
cause them to suspect something was bothering him; that perhaps he had 
something to hide. Breffort wore stoicism like it was a steel helm, 
here. Equals they may deem each other as, but none had earned this 
standing in Soldats through an open face and loose tongue.

The fireplace Breffort and the other four men where seated around was 
huge, eclipsing the rest of the windowless room&#39;s features, and was the 
sole font of illumination. Bright flames billowed wildly in the hearth 
behind a row of cast-iron bars capped with spear-points as if furious at 
being caged, the fire&#39;s rage a palpable heat against Breffort&#39;s face. 
The flickering flames painted capering shadows on the walls, the 
silhouettes of cavorting heathens worshiping some pagan god. The breaks 
in the dancers&#39; steps revealed the backdrop they gambolled in front of, 
shaded in an orange hue; rosewood wall panels adorned with relics from 
an age long past, from an age drenched in darkness. A complete suit of 
full plate armour, its individual pieces fixed together by near 
invisible pins, stood erect against one portion of wall, halberd held 
upright in one heavy gauntlet. Other leftovers of the medieval era 
joined it, including a broad assortment of martial blades mounted on the 
walls, blades crafted in different regions all over the globe. 
Claymores, long swords, scimitars, cutlasses; the list was wide-ranging. 
They gleamed in the firelight, ancient metal polished until it was 
burnished as in days of old, time-blunted edges re-sharpened to a 
razor&#39;s precision. Coat-of-arms from several forgotten bloodlines 
sometimes accompanied the blades, kite shields with faded decorations 
hinting at twinkling stars and springing lions flanked by slanted 
rapiers or fastened atop crossed broadswords.

Trophies of the hunt made their home among the memories of archaic 
warfare also, the heads of game animals affixed to wooden plaques--deer, 
bears, even a moose. But like with the artefacts collected from the Dark 
Ages, they were not what drew a discerning eye.

A framed tapestry hung above the fireplace, its once dyed embroidery 
long since faded to earth tones with age, but the scene it depicted 
still persisted, as did the legend it was based on despite the council&#39;s 
ongoing efforts to quash the decreed &#39;outdated&#39; concept. Two young women 
faced each other on bended knee; the right of long, sinuous tresses like 
deep silken waves down her back, her partner of short, capricious locks 
cut to the nape of her neck. Garlands wreathed the crowns of their 
heads, white blossoms in the long hair of one, a circle of green leaves 
in the short hair of the other. The women were clad in naught but a 
flowing robe that bared them to the waist, the loose draping imperilling 
more skin to be exposed, yet it was not their unsullied forms that 
stirred allure. Swords the women clasped in their hands, twin edges held 
flawlessly straight and true towards the heavens, the taller woman on 
the right with a blade of gold and the shorter on the left with one of 
silver, the colours still unmistakable in spite of the fabric&#39;s wear. 
They were the maidens who had reigned over Death more than a thousand 
years ago, the first pair of Black Hands--the first Noir.

The pure maidens were the accepted universal symbol of Soldats, even 
today, although it wasn&#39;t until recently that the notion of Noir had 
been revived and a new generation of young female assassins had donned 
the grim but prestigious mantle. It was of the council&#39;s opinion that 
the idea of two people alone cleansing the Earth of the taint of 
darkness was ludicrous in this modern day and age. The blood of Soldats 
had spread all but to the most remote places in the world; there was 
virtually nowhere that Soldats could now no longer touch and therefore 
there was no need of the Black Hands. Or so was the excuse that the 
council had given for letting dust amass on the tradition. Breffort 
believed differently, and on more than one occasion had tactfully 
attempted to sway the council into accepting at least Bouquet--half of 
the current embodiment of Noir--into their fold, however his view 
matched his colleagues&#39; regarding the ritual of Le Grand Retour itself. 
The restoration of Noir did not need to be tied together with the return 
to the old ways. A pair of insurmountable assassins *was* useful in this 
era, and could mesh agreeably with the present makeup of Soldats. But 
Breffort knew the rest of the council feared Noir, as well. They feared 
the power they would be granted if acknowledged as the Eternal Darkness 
whilst part of Soldats. Exiled, Noir remained an inspiration of dread, 
but at least they enjoyed no dominion over the organisation&#39;s swollen 
ranks.

Moreover, there was the disquieting issue of the Kind Mother. A third 
figure was sown into the tapestry, a noticeably older woman than the two 
maidens, standing with a veneer of benevolence over the pair. Clothed in 
an enveloping brown robe, its degree of modesty highlighting the 
maidens&#39; partial state of undress, with a cowl closely framing her 
benign countenance, there was little doubt that she presided over the 
young women kneeling before her. Compassionate she appeared to be, and 
perhaps the original Kind Mother, the one whom had purportedly 
established the first Black Hands, sincerely had been, but Breffort knew 
as fact that not all of the women who had served as caretakers for Noir 
were of humane heart. Altena had been one such Kind Mother, although 
officially she had never actually been honoured with the title. Breffort 
had known Altena only by reputation and had seen her merely from afar, 
but even then he could detect the light of wicked ambition in her eyes 
beneath her fa&ccedil;ade of maternal concern. The council had feared her 
perhaps even more than the Eternal Darkness itself. After all, it is the 
Kind Mother who, as a rule, initially places the harness upon Noir and 
has the prerogative to direct their blades as she pleases. After Altena, 
the council would never permit another Kind Mother to draw breath. But 
whether or not their feelings for Noir, namely Bouquet and her young 
partner, ran the same....

Breffort studied the men assembled around him, dressed similarly to him 
in fully buttoned, stiff collared, green suit jackets, though he 
produced no outward show of doing so. Guarded was his grey gaze; 
circumspect was its movements. Some sat slouched in their armchairs, 
giving all the appearance of a laid-back disposition, while others sat 
poised as if in the highest royal court, straight-backed with chin 
raised. They came from different backgrounds, had different mannerisms, 
but all four councilmen had essentially the same natures. Natures that 
drove them to reign over others, natures that boasted the right spark of 
command and fortitude that enabled them to realise what they sought. 
Breffort supposed he was not too unlike them in that respect.

In any other set of circumstances where these individuals encountered 
one another, a clash of personalities, of wills, would have inevitably 
erupted like a sudden artic storm, cold calculated scheming to topple 
the man next to them hidden behind every stare. But all gathered here 
were regarded as having equal footing in Soldats, irrespective of one&#39;s 
actual current standing. Power waxed and waned among the council members 
like in any board of directors, influence always swelling and shrinking 
reminiscent of the tides, and for that reason no one ever chanced 
abusing their periodically improved pre-eminence in an effort to 
outstrip their fellow councilmen. The ones who had succumbed to the 
temptation were already long departed from the council, and from the 
living world. &#39;Those at the top have the longest to fall, and land the 
hardest&#39;. Words neither Breffort nor the men around him forgot.

&quot;I am heartened to see that your absence from our company was a short 
one this time. These are yet turbulent times, and this committee values 
your voice amongst us.&quot;

Breffort said nothing in response, choosing to simply stare 
expressionlessly into the crackling fire. In addition to having a chair 
on the Soldats council and acting as its representative, he was its 
primary advisor. His close personal involvement in the world&#39;s affairs 
apparently qualified him for the task, and hence his opinion carried 
great weight within this sitting room, and to the ears of the four men 
occupying it. And they believed him their equal. A preposterous notion 
when given even the slightest intelligent thought. They were like lambs 
begging to be shepherded, and they looked to Breffort to be the 
shepherd. If Breffort were so inclined he could lead them all to the 
slaughter, oblivious even as the knife took their throats. They were 
fortunate that he was content with the current arrangement; no wise 
sayings suggesting caution would have stayed his hand if not.

The man who had spoken sat in the armchair next to Breffort&#39;s, at the 
apex of the arc around the fireplace, and it could be said his position 
was an accurate depiction of his present repute. His hair was blonde, 
the colour of hay, and cropped short into almost unruly locks, as if he 
had just climbed out of bed and neglected brushing them into some 
semblance of order. A large silver ring circled the third finger of his 
left hand, shimmering in the frolicking flames trapped in the fireplace, 
the light caressing the profiles of two young women facing away from 
each other raised in the centre of the ring. All one had to do was 
glance at the tapestry above the hearth to identify the renowned pair. 
Bordering the likenesses of the original Noir on either side was a 
coat-of-arms much like the ones on display around the room, imprinted on 
a miniature kite shield worked into the metal. Allegedly they were the 
family crests of the wearer&#39;s mother and father, whose bloodlines--and 
in turn, the wearer&#39;s by association--reached as far back as to the 
century when the earliest incarnation of Noir was bestowed the swords 
they would later rout armies with from the first Kind Mother. Supposedly 
the councilman&#39;s ancestors had even been in attendance to witness the 
deed, but Breffort found that unlikely. He had heard that in Langonel&#39;s 
Manuscript the event had been documented, and it was apparently written 
there that no one but the two maidens and the Kind Mother had been 
present in the cavern underneath Langonel Monastery--the latter&#39;s 
remains lying on the same land as the Manor today--at the time of the 
conferment. Nevertheless, the mere implication had awarded the council 
member a great deal of prestige and respect, and the ring was a constant 
reminder of his &#39;notable&#39; heritage... and the esteem it conveyed.

&quot;The offer has been made,&quot; Breffort announced to the room before the 
blonde councilman could speak again. It was what he and the rest of the 
council wanted to hear about anyway. Breffort had spared them the 
trouble of subtly urging him to speak on the matter, which they would 
have resorted to eventually. &quot;Noir will go to Japan.&quot;

Silence reigned once Breffort closed his mouth, the other four men quiet 
as they turned over the information in their minds again and again, no 
doubt ruminating on how this development would play out in the future, 
and how it would affect other, related, affairs.

A man across from Breffort, glasses on his nose and with his long brown 
hair tied in a ponytail that hung over one shoulder, frowned as he 
stared at Breffort. Several fingers of his steepled hands were 
ornamented with plain gold and silver bands that shone dully in the 
firelight, but as to their purpose or significance, Breffort couldn&#39;t 
fathom. &quot;They accepted, then?&quot; he inquired, the skepticism clear in his 
voice.

&quot;No,&quot; Breffort said. &quot;But they will go.&quot;

&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot; the man beside Breffort&#39;s bespectacled 
colleague piped up. He wore his black hair even shorter than the 
councilman at the head of the semi-circle, and a neatly trimmed beard 
covered his chin, as if he had dipped it in soot. &quot;The memory of Noir 
stepping out of the Manor is still fresh in my mind. Corsica&#39;s Daughter 
did not come across as the most... amenable woman. She may have bent to 
our bidding once, but it was to suit her own purposes, not ours.&quot;

&quot;She will bend again. Like before, it is in her best interest to go,&quot; 
Breffort explained, unruffled, &quot;and therefore, she will comply. 
Ishinomori is as much her and her partner&#39;s enemy now as she is ours. 
Corsica&#39;s Daughter is not one to sit around and do nothing when 
threatened, even if that means abiding Soldats.&quot;

The man with greyish-brown hair that fell in slight waves to his neck in 
the armchair to Breffort&#39;s left snorted softly, and a shade derisively. 
He swished the snifter of brandy in the glass he held elegantly in one 
white-gloved hand, gazing into its swirling burgundy depths before 
taking a taste. Once the glass left his lips, he spoke, his words 
directed at Breffort, but his eyes affixed to his drink. &quot;You still 
believe she can be persuaded to join,&quot; he said. Breffort could 
practically hear the rebuke in his somewhat dumbfounded tone. &quot;She will 
never join us. Altena saw to that.&quot; He shook his head slightly. &quot;She is 
dangerous. Noir is dangerous. *Too* dangerous. Better if we&#39;d had them 
executed after they dealt with Altena and her rabble.&quot;

There were some thoughtful mutters at this, but before they could be 
turned to mutters of agreement, Breffort interrupted. &quot;Dangerous they 
are, but they can still be leashed and used. Used as they were supposed 
to be. As the Hands of Soldats.&quot;

The bespectacled councilman murmured contemplatively. &quot;During the past 
several weeks, word has reached my ears that a great number of 
foreigners have been seen flocking to Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals 
headquarters, many of which are recognised to have been supporters of 
Altena and her now defunct ideology.&quot; Breffort had received reports 
detailing the same, as he assumed everybody else in the room had, too. 
Despite being in charge of putting down Ishinomori&#39;s revolt, he wasn&#39;t 
the only council member with operatives deep in Japanese society, least 
of all Yokohama&#39;s, in spite of the current tumultuous state of affairs 
for agents in that city. The blood of Soldats had stretched all across 
the globe, after all.

&quot;Defunct indeed,&quot; the bearded individual adjacent to the man with the 
ponytail interjected. &quot;Yet I have also heard rumours that they plan to 
follow in their toppled leader&#39;s footsteps and initiate Le Grand Retour 
once more. The fools. Do they really believe we fear it? That we tremble 
before archaic folly? They will be as successful as Altena had been, 
maybe even less. I can&#39;t even grasp *how* they will go about it.&quot;

The bespectacled council member glanced a touch irritably at his 
colleague and took a moment to adjust his glasses, appearing somewhat 
put out at being interrupted. Once he was sure there were no further 
outbursts imminent, he continued. &quot;Unknown numbers congregate to be 
sure, but possibly enough for an army on top of what our young dissenter 
has already drafted from Kanagawa&#39;s criminal element. This conflict has 
been bloody on both sides, and it will only get bloodier if that&#39;s the 
case. Though I fear it will anyway, regardless. It would be to our 
advantage if Noir where there to lead our strikes, or at least to remove 
a few choice players from the field with surgical precision.&quot;

The man sipping brandy grunted disdainfully, but in grudging acceptance, 
also. He had always been a stanch advocate against Bouquet&#39;s inclusion 
in Soldats ranks, and in the existence of Noir in general. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; He 
brightened suddenly, giving his liquor another spin in its glass. &quot;Yes. 
Let the brazen upstart and the renegade Hands destroy one another. Even 
if one survives, we will be rid of at least the other.&quot;

&quot;How much control do you really have over Noir, Breffort?&quot; the blonde 
councilman probed, leaning forward a fraction in his armchair. &quot;How much 
do they know?&quot;

&quot;They know enough,&quot; Breffort replied cryptically, pointedly ignoring the 
first query.

&quot;And what, pray tell, is that?&quot;

&quot;They know what I want them to know,&quot; Breffort clarified without 
emotion, unwaveringly meeting his interrogator&#39;s eye. The blonde man 
relaxed back into his seat, his hands gripping the armrests, his heavy 
ring in plain sight. There was silence then, but the unspoken questions 
could almost be discerned hovering in the air amidst the council. How 
tight is the leash around Noir&#39;s neck? To what measure have they been 
tamed? Breffort was aware his peers were apprehensive regarding his 
influence over Bouquet and her partner. Too loose a leash, too little 
tamed, and Noir may ultimately turn on him and on Soldats, creating 
quite a thorny situation indeed. Alone, Soldats would crush them, but in 
the latter scenario the Eternal Darkness may perchance side with 
Ishinomori, and then prove to be a considerable menace. Having Noir 
under their banner would vastly improve the traitors&#39; repute, and could 
possibly sway more people to rally to their cause. However, it was a 
very slim likelihood that Bouquet would consent to uniting with 
Ishinomori. Breffort had seen to that. But the council did not know what 
he knew, and therefore worried.

Yet worse in the council&#39;s judgment would be if Breffort&#39;s leash was too 
tight, Noir having been tamed too much. True, it meant that the young 
assassins would fight for them, but would Breffort then be tempted to 
unleash his pet Black Hands upon the council and seize control of 
Soldats&#39; head entirely?

Wary, considering eyes watched Breffort, but he remained as unmoved as 
always. Let them deliberate, let them agonise. He could alleviate their 
fear by telling all, but he would not reveal all his cards nor disclose 
what he had up his sleeves; not now, not until what needed to be done 
was done. That fear, that uncertainty, was guaranteed to keep him alive, 
leaving him free to conspire as he pleased. As long as the council 
believed there was a possibility that he had Noir totally under his 
thumb, his position was secure. They would not make a move against him 
while risking swift and fatal reprisal.

&quot;A dangerous game you play, Breffort,&quot; the blonde council member spoke 
at last. Breffort said nothing in answer. A dangerous game he played? It 
was a dangerous life he lived.

******

Kirika gazed sombrely out a window in the apartment she contentedly 
lived in together with Mireille, drinking in the Paris skyline for what 
would probably be the last time in a long while. Her arms were folded 
under her on the windowsill, supporting her slender frame while she 
leaned slightly toward the pale blue horizon laid out before her, the 
shade of a frozen lake. The window had been pulled fully open, heedless 
of the budding winter&#39;s hallmarks, inviting the cool late morning air 
into the living room. But the quiet girl was left unscathed by the 
chilly breezes that brushed her face and wafted through her short hair; 
her mind elsewhere, lost in introspective thought. Lost in a pale blue 
horizon.

Kirika&#39;s bag, coloured black and trimmed in yellow, and with yellow 
shoulder strap connected, was slumped like a giant lumpy sausage by her 
feet, its material bulging in some spots and flaccid in others. It had 
routinely carried her belongings to whatever part of the planet her and 
Mireille&#39;s assignments hauled them both off to, and had done so ever 
since she had agreed to come live with the blonde in Paris, the latter 
journey from Japan, though not exactly because of a contract--unless 
counting the fateful one struck between Kirika and her partner which 
would wind up shaping their lives to what they were today--included. 
This new assignment from Breffort was no different. Kirika&#39;s bag was 
already packed and ready to go, crammed to bursting with clothes and 9mm 
pistol magazines secreted in special compartments inside the inner 
lining that would serve to veil them from airport security. However, 
Kirika herself had chosen barely a handful of the garments. Earlier, 
when she had been indiscriminately pulling out articles of her clothing 
from the wardrobe with the intention of taking them along with her on 
the trip, Mireille had interrupted her and kindly yet compellingly 
advised her on which to bring and which not to bring to the point the 
older woman may as well have packed Kirika&#39;s bag herself. Kirika hadn&#39;t 
taken umbrage, though, and had agreed to all of her partner&#39;s 
recommendations--clothes were just clothes to her. As long as they could 
be worn and were reasonably comfortable, she didn&#39;t care what colour 
they were or what style they were cut in.

Mireille&#39;s intervention meant that the woman herself hadn&#39;t had the 
chance to tend to her suitcase, but was now taking the time to do just 
that in the bedroom. The last Kirika had seen, the blonde&#39;s suitcase had 
been flipped open on the bed, still empty, and had been surrounded by 
layers of clothes covering the bedspread with their hangers still 
attached. Mireille had been standing over the whole muddle with her 
hands on her hips and a serious expression plastered on her fine 
features, the wardrobe to her rear with its double doors flung wide 
open, virtually devoid of clothes but for a few of Kirika&#39;s that were 
remaining behind here in Paris. The statuesque woman had appeared to 
evaluate each item of apparel spread out in front of her very carefully 
as if weighing all their merits and shortcomings, sand-coloured eyebrows 
sloping and pink lips pursed thoughtfully. It had been as though she was 
selecting firearms for all the heavy consideration she devoted. Kirika 
felt it unnecessary deliberation, but what did she know about such 
things. She was sure Mireille had her reasons, although the girl 
suspected they would undoubtedly sound peculiar to her.

In spite of how much she seemed to agonise over the affair, Mireille 
knew how to pack light and minimise her luggage to a single small 
suitcase, and was skilled in using baggage space to its maximum 
efficiency. Still, it did take her a while. But in the meantime Kirika 
always found things to occupy herself with. Gazing inconspicuously at 
Mireille and admiring the divine woman&#39;s presence was one, and gazing at 
the sky, musing and reflecting, was another. The second fancy had taken 
her on this occasion, but given recent events, it was little surprise.

Spires and skyscrapers, rooftops and treetops, broke the panorama 
outside the window, yet neither they nor the view&#39;s familiarity to her 
eyes diminished its allure to Kirika. But there was something about a 
horizon that had always drawn her eyes, something about the sight of a 
sky so blue, so open, limitless in its vastness. It didn&#39;t matter where 
she was, exactly which horizon she was seeing; they were all the same to 
her. The same sky filled with the same infinite possibilities. Often 
Kirika had looked upon it since waking up in that bed, in that empty 
house of falsehood, wondering at what lay beyond the blue. Wondering 
what the future held... and earnestly hoping that it contained what was 
achingly missing in her life. In the past she had yearned for a cure to 
the loneliness that had constantly gnawed at her heart and dogged her 
existence from the moment she had awoke, namely the partner that the 
title, Noir, had promised. She could recall the many times she had 
stared out her classroom&#39;s windows after school was over back in Japan, 
wishing, and imagining what their face would look like when they at last 
met... or if they would ever meet at all.

But of course now Kirika was gratefully aware that her fears had been 
unwarranted. She now knew in vivid detail what her partner&#39;s face looked 
like, and just how breathtaking a face it was, too. She had committed 
every aspect of it, every dimple, every contour, to memory, glad to 
never have to resort to dreaming up its likeness ever again. And when 
she looked into Mireille&#39;s blue eyes, so similar to the sky she held in 
such esteem, she saw without uncertainty that whatever her future 
entailed, it rested with the woman. Kirika had a place in the world, and 
it was beside Mireille. Nothing would ever part them, bar the cold 
embrace of the grave. Even if--for some terrible reason Kirika would 
rather not think about--the blonde cast her aside one day, she, while 
being devastatingly stricken, would nonetheless remain hidden in the 
background; a demon forever watching over her angel from afar. It would 
be agonising to have Mireille hate her, to never be able to walk next to 
her again, or have a meal together, or share the same bed, but Kirika 
would bear the agony of a horrendously fractured heart to ensure that 
her wordless oath to Odette Bouquet would be upheld. Kirika would bear 
*anything* for Mireille... and that had nothing to do with atonement for 
past wrongs.

Despite all that had improved in her life, Kirika still gazed at the 
horizon, still she thought about what lay beyond it, still she longed 
for more change. Mireille had eased her lonely heart, but Kirika&#39;s soul 
cried out for freedom from further defilement. It cried out for a time 
of peace, a time when she would stain her hands black with sin no 
longer.

Nevertheless, as the young assassin stared at the serene Parisian 
horizon this morning, silently wondering, her yearning merely occupied a 
part of her deep meditative thoughts. The bulk of Kirika&#39;s mind was once 
again dwelling on what the future had in store for her. Specifically 
what it had in store for her and for Mireille. In Yokohama.

Kirika had had an opportunity to inspect the airplane tickets Breffort 
had more or less forced upon Mireille yesterday, and had noted that her 
and her partner&#39;s flight from Charles de Gaulle International Airport 
would land in Narita International Airport, located in the capitol city; 
Tokyo. But she was certain that their final destination would be the 
nearby city of Yokohama. The assassin had, when Mireille hadn&#39;t been 
busy frowning at them, scanned an attentive eye over the documents from 
Breffort&#39;s dossier that had once been scattered chaotically across the 
billiard table in the living room--but were now all tidily slotted into 
their folder again, waiting to be packed in Mireille&#39;s laptop bag and 
taken on their trip--memorising critical data on the enemy, and as a 
result was conscious of the fact that Ryosuke and Vincent, together with 
Kaede Ishinomori and whatever allies she had rounded up in Japan so far, 
called Yokohama their home. One way or another, Kirika and Mireille 
would eventually find themselves in that far eastern city. And to get 
there, they would have to pass through Kawasaki.

Kirika wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about that. Japan... Kawasaki.... They 
were places linked to her, linked to her sinister, anguished past. She 
understood what she *had* to do in Japan, and was determined to see it 
all through in bullets and blood if needed, but other than that, her 
exact sentiments on returning to her native land and birthplace for the 
first time since she had left it were difficult to ascertain.

Kirika recognised that she most likely had been born in Japan and, 
definitely, to Japanese parents--the face that stared back at her when 
she looked in a mirror was enough for her to conclude that--but 
precisely *where* in the country was up for debate... and that was only 
if her belief that she had been born in the island nation was accurate. 
However, Kirika considered herself to have been born in the city of 
Kawasaki, though not in the regular sense of the word. Her earliest 
memories were of opening drowsy eyes to the sight of a bedroom that was 
hers and yet not hers, in a house belonging to a family that didn&#39;t 
really exist. Memories of waking to the chime of a solitary name 
drifting through her head, a name of a destiny still to be resolved and 
realised. Memories of waking to a life made of lies and loneliness, 
danger and bewilderment. *Her* earliest memories--her own, personal 
memories that she had recorded herself. Kirika felt that she had been 
brought into the world on that day in Kawasaki.

It occurred to Kirika that perhaps there was more meaning behind that 
conviction than she had wished for. The assassin knew little of her life 
before her awakening in Kawasaki, apart from what she had pieced 
together using the memory fragments that floated around inside her mind 
like shards of a shattered mirror, shaping a jagged, mismatched 
representation of her past, a distorted reflection of the real picture. 
But the thing was that none of those fragments were actually memories 
that she had made herself. They didn&#39;t belong to the life she had lived, 
but rather to the body she inhabited. Then what exactly did that mean? 
Did that mean that Kirika had truly been born lying on that bed in 
Kawasaki, her existence as she knew it now given life when her eyes had 
crept open? Was the other her, the darkness, in fact the authentic her, 
and she herself a usurper of the body she--they--wore? Or was Kirika, as 
she believed right now and always had, the genuine owner of her body who 
had simply forgotten her past, and the darkness the invader who 
threatened to steal her identity unless she kept it at bay? Or were they 
one in the same, two distinct existences but both part of a whole 
individual, having been somewhere along line disjointed into two 
separate halves? Who could say which premise was the correct one, or if 
any of them were correct at all? Certainly not Kirika. Notions like 
those were on the threshold of her comprehension, befuddling to her 
brain, and not to mention unnerving to say the least. They were 
disturbing to dwell on for any length of time, quickly bringing down her 
spirits and forcing her ask questions of herself she would rather not 
address. Kirika hastily drove the unsettling musings out of her head, 
striving for solace in the calming light blue hues streaked with wisps 
of white ahead of her.

Never taking her eyes off the uneven horizon, Kirika reached a hand into 
a pocket of her parka and took out a small, white, rectangular card; one 
half covered in black scrawl, the other by a miniature colour 
photograph. Her gaze eventually panned downwards to favour it with an 
absorbed look equal to the one she had given the sky. It was the student 
identification card she had carried with her ever since she had 
discovered it in her bedroom in Japan. It was a total fabrication of 
course, with every personal detail listed from her date of birth to her 
very name, built on a lie. Only the portrait of the young darkhaired 
girl on the card had any validity to it. But forged or not, the ID was a 
symbol of who she was now. Her name, Kirika Yuumura, was a fake, but she 
had adopted and grown into the identity nonetheless. She *was* Kirika 
Yuumura now. Kirika Yuumura who had lived alone in what had allegedly 
been her parents&#39; house while the figments were off in America; Kirika 
Yuumura who had attended classes at Tsubaki High School; Kirika Yuumura 
who was trained as an assassin and worked as such with a partner, 
Mireille Bouquet, a renowned professional killer in the European 
underworld; Kirika Yuumura who lived in Paris with said partner, 
Mireille, the woman who stirred her tender heart and placated her 
distorted soul.

In addition to being a symbol of who Kirika was now, the Tsubaki High 
School student card was a symbol of who she had been before meeting 
Mireille and learning of her intricate entanglement with Soldats; a 
reminder of the reasonably normal life she had once held, a life she 
aspired to someday capture an air of again. The girl&#39;s time in Kawasaki 
after her awakening, while fleeting, had had a feel of normalcy to it, 
even with the strange and disquieting factors lurking just below the 
surface of the otherwise ordinary life. Once she had gotten her bearings 
and grasped who she was supposedly meant to be from the clues sprinkled 
around what had apparently been her house, Kirika had settled into a 
routine typical of any high school student. She had went to school in 
the morning, listened to her teachers in class, prepared her own 
bento--after discreetly studying her classmates&#39; labours and making 
several practice attempts--and ate it at lunchtime, and had did her 
homework. It had been a simple and monotonous routine, and one she had 
performed automatically, barely bestowing conscious thought to any 
specific facet of her daily schedule. A hollow and barren existence 
bereft of any significant purpose beyond that of getting to school on 
time and keeping up with her class&#39;s teaching program. The impression 
that things were... just *wrong*, that it was not supposed to be this 
way, had pursued Kirika every time she had donned her school uniform, 
every time she had took care of the household chores; it had been an 
uneasiness that had never left her for a moment.

It had been little more than a week before the first batch of dark-clad 
men fixated on murdering her had ambushed Kirika on the route back to 
her house one late afternoon after school. She had killed them all with 
a deadly grace that had astonished her, handling the Beretta that she 
had kept in her school case for safekeeping--a firearm that she had been 
startled to discover she understood the complete mechanics of--as though 
it had been an extension of herself. And then everything had changed; 
relative normalcy had been mortally wounded, bleeding out a bit more 
with each passing day. Kirika had craved the tedium of her routine, 
then, and began to savour its ordinary feel while it was not being 
shattered by sudden bouts of inexplicable carnage where she had been 
required to kill in defence of her life without even knowing why. 
Desperate to retain a grip on a dying lifestyle she abruptly appreciated 
a lot more, Kirika had even went so far as to incorporate the periodic 
assassination attempts into her normal daily routine, a wretched and 
inescapable part of that routine that came without warning, but one she 
accepted and dealt with as stoically and mechanically as cooking her 
dinner.

Her double life as high school student and target of shadowy hitmen 
persisted for a couple of months before Kirika finally acknowledged that 
she had to find answers to fill the gaping holes in her memory, or else 
sooner or later succumb to her yet unmasked foe, going to an unmarked 
grave without learning anything of who she really was and without coming 
close to achieving any of her dreams. So she had contacted Mireille, the 
pertinent information on the wonderful woman having been gained by 
scouring the files on the computer at her house. The blonde&#39;s had been 
the only record available, but Kirika had implicitly known that she was 
the right person to speak to about the riddle that had been her life. 
She had somehow known that the pocket watch she had found with the 
Beretta in a drawer of her dresser was the chain that linked them. The 
girl hadn&#39;t fretted over her decision whether or not to contact 
Mireille, someone she had been aware was a killer for hire; partly 
because of that confidence that they were somehow connected, and partly 
because she had came to an impasse where she *had* to take a step 
forward, irrespective of the danger, or fester and die.

And once Mireille made her entrance in Kirika&#39;s life, everything had 
changed again. For the better this time--obviously, with someone as 
marvellous as Mireille in her life--but Kirika&#39;s everyday way of life 
had been lost utterly in the process, whatever tatters that had 
remained, but that the girl had treasured regardless, blow away like 
dust in the wind. All that was left of that time--that life--was the 
card that she held in her hand. But would she trade what she had now 
with Mireille for what she had had back then? Never. She and Mireille 
could be under constant attack every single day of every single week, 
but as long as Kirika was with her love, fighting by her side throughout 
those days, protecting her angel, it was sufficient enough joy to 
nourish her heart.

Kirika resumed her contemplation of the sky above Paris, her cherished 
student card remaining safely cupped in the palm of her hand. Despite 
the extensive history between herself and Kawasaki, between herself and 
Japan--her birthplace, where her lost life had been lived, even the 
place where she had first met Mireille--one thing she was sure of was 
that she felt no allegiance or attachment towards either city or 
country. When she returned to Kawasaki, however briefly, she would not 
be returning home. Like Mireille and her opinion of her native Corsica, 
Kirika didn&#39;t look upon Japan as her home. *Here* was home, this 
apartment in Paris. Whatever her exact feelings about her and Mireille 
going to Japan, to Yokohama, were, Kirika at least knew where she 
belonged. Where she and her partner must eventually return. The future 
was unclear, but it *would* contain that particular homecoming, at least 
for the older assassin. Kirika would make sure of it... and pay for that 
guarantee in as much sin and slaughter as needed.

A piercing chill suddenly sliced through Kirika, cutting to the bone and 
turning marrow to ice. She shivered and hunched her slim shoulders into 
herself, huddling as if trying to keep warm. However, the abrupt cold 
was not due to a biting wind gusting through the open apartment window, 
and her huddle was not to aid in retaining body heat, but in fact an 
instinctive defensive gesture. After last night--after many nights, in 
truth, she now shockingly realised--Kirika had to question whether her 
prior thought had sincerely been her own. She was set on her path, 
resolute in her choice to kill as called for in Japan... but she 
wondered. Had it truly been her who had reasoned out that conclusion? 
Had that deduction been of *her* mind&#39;s own making?

Unlike the night before, Kirika could recollect the dream--the 
nightmare--she&#39;d suffered last night, but not without being wracked by a 
severe sense of foreboding laced with trepidation. It was with a lump in 
a dried out throat and a clammy claw squeezing her heart that she 
remembered walking down the familiar dirt trail that led between the 
Manor&#39;s vineyards, remembered walking closer and closer to a patiently 
waiting Altena, kindly and slightly knowing smile on her face, the woman 
all but spreading her arms wide in welcome. And Kirika remembered having 
been powerless to stop herself from drawing nearer. Seeing a woman in 
her dreams who had been the closest equivalent to a high priestess of 
Soldats, a woman Kirika herself had pushed to a fiery death, a woman who 
had held sway over her life--dominated her being--nearly from the 
cradle, was bad enough, but the memory of the helplessness she had 
excruciatingly experienced was what made her tremble the most. That, and 
what she had heard, confined in her mind.

The dream had ended with the terrified girl waking up in a jolt, eyelids 
bursting wide open, and a distinct voice ringing in her head. The voice, 
no more than a whisper but seeming booming all the same, had had the 
unforgettable deceivingly compassionate tones of Altena&#39;s. How? Why? 
Kirika hadn&#39;t known then, panting softly in bed with cold dampness 
slicked across her forehead, and still didn&#39;t know now. But she knew 
where she had heard something of its like before. Several times before, 
in fact. Mireille had snoozed on peacefully beside Kirika for the 
remainder of that night, thankfully oblivious to her partner&#39;s frightful 
rousing, and hopefully dreaming easier, happier, dreams. But Kirika 
hadn&#39;t been able to let sleep claim her again until the blessed light of 
dawn fell upon the bed sheets, her body too tense, and her mind plagued 
by insidious insight. And all the while fearing she would hear the 
gentle, whispering intonations of a dead woman at any moment.

Kirika recognised now that her thoughts had been... erratic... of late. 
Notions and concepts that she would normally never have considered for 
more than an instant, if even that, had sporadically skittered across 
her mind; not so divergent from her own thoughts and feelings, and yet 
warped to have a harsher edge, a darker undercurrent. Attitudes and 
worries perverted to prejudices and suspicions, love and duty to zeal 
and fanaticism. The diminutive assassin couldn&#39;t quite recall when the 
distortion had first started, but she wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was 
when the darkness had initially restirred within her. What she could 
recall, however, was that the twisted thoughts had gradually gained in 
potency as time had passed, hazy musings coalescing to explicit ideas, 
and last night, finally, they had completed the evolution from shapeless 
thought to unequivocal voice. Then, and *only* then, had Kirika grasped 
what was going on. She had been careless. A dangerous thing to be, when 
perpetually up against a bitter enemy such as the one she harboured 
inside her, an enemy as inescapable as though she and it--she and 
*her*--were each a side of the same coin.

Yes, the voice had to be related to the dark seed implanted in Kirika&#39;s 
head, a seed that had already cracked open, and recently had been 
ominously blooming in an obscurity imposed by its keeper&#39;s refusal to 
acknowledge it. A decision the girl hugely regretted now. Those 
disturbing thoughts, the manipulative voice that sounded like Altena&#39;s; 
it was some sort of assault on her by the darkness, by her other self. 
It had to be. What other explanation was there? It had been pure na&iuml;vet&eacute; 
for Kirika to have believed that just because she was determined to 
prevail over her dark self; just because she had vowed to stand utterly 
firm against it; just because she&#39;d had unwavering faith that she would 
hurl it back into the shadowed corners of her mind as if it were some 
mere errant thought; that the darkness would simply accede to her 
&#39;indomitable&#39; spirit, that the black flower that oozed corruption would 
simply wither in the searing light of her conviction, the blazing rot 
spreading to its very roots and along them until the darkness was sealed 
into a seed once again, maybe even permanently. Just because the 
darkness was ignored, didn&#39;t mean it ceased to be. Kirika&#39;s 
overconfidence had left her completely vulnerable to attack, blind to 
her other self&#39;s machinations. She anxiously speculated on how much harm 
had been done in her ignorance, how much of the black flower&#39;s foul 
taint had leaked into her mind&#39;s thought patterns and had bent them to 
match her eternal foe&#39;s. Kirika wondered how much of her mind had been 
despoiled... and how much of it was still her own.

Kirika closed her eyes and clutched the student card in her hand 
tighter, as if holding onto it would in turn somehow help her maintain a 
steady grip on herself. She was scared and her self-assurance had been 
shaken, but she would persevere nevertheless. The petite girl was still 
determined to defeat her dark self, still vowed to confront it with a 
steadfast will, still had faith she would eventually imprison it in a 
cage of her mind&#39;s own making again. Kirika knew what to watch out for 
now, knew Altena&#39;s murmuring voice for what it was. There had been no 
further whispers in her head as yet, but she would be wary of them if 
they arose, and of odd thoughts as well, from here on out. Kirika would 
just refuse to listen to them, or better yet, not even acknowledge them; 
she would continue to resist the lure of the darkness no matter what. 
The fight between them was as real as any other the skilled assassin had 
faced whilst on an assignment, with the costs the same--it was a fight 
for her survival. And this target would not be vanquished as 
straightforwardly as those before. This target, after all, shared her 
essence. Shared her soul.

Kirika&#39;s eyelids brushed open as she abruptly picked up the rap of boot 
heels on hardwood resounding nearer and nearer behind her, the tempo 
well-known to her ears. Even if Mireille hadn&#39;t been the sole other 
person in the apartment with her, the young assassin would still have 
recognised that it was her partner approaching. Kirika could identify 
Mireille&#39;s step by sound alone if the surface the blonde trod on was 
hard enough, the woman&#39;s penchant for high-heeled footwear making it all 
the easier. She knew how fast her love&#39;s long legs could pump when 
dashing, how far her stride reached while strolling; the marked rhythms 
and others memorised, beats hammered into her mind. Kirika would never 
mistake Mireille for a skulking backstabber sneaking up behind her in 
the middle of a gunfight; never accidentally send lead streaming her 
partner&#39;s way as she flashed by in a sprint... as long as she heard her 
coming. Mireille could tread quite lightly sometimes, her stealthy 
advances on more than one occasion having forced Kirika to strain her 
sharp ears to detect her. And even then, sometimes the adept girl still 
hadn&#39;t. Like now, for instance. However, Kirika felt she knew why that 
was in this case.

Kirika turned from the window, and was a little startled to discover 
that Mireille was almost upon her, and even more taken aback when she 
cast a look past the woman&#39;s shoulder, espying the blonde&#39;s small 
trolley-like suitcase, obviously packed, propped with its carry handle 
extended up against the black partition separating the living room from 
the bedroom, positioned close to the short hallway that led to the 
apartment&#39;s front door. Yet doubly shocking was that a grey ceramic 
pitcher was in Mireille&#39;s hand, filled to the brim with water if 
Kirika&#39;s guess was right. Kirika hadn&#39;t heard so much as a grunt when 
her partner had hauled her suitcase down the bedroom&#39;s steps into the 
living room, not so much as a click of boot heels when she had walked 
all the way to the kitchen, nor a creak of hinges when she had fetched 
the big round jug from a cabinet, and neither the squeak of a turning 
tap nor the rush of flowing water when she had filled it. None of it had 
reached her ears. Or rather, none of it had passed any further than 
that. Kirika&#39;s ears had been open, alert as always, but her mind had 
been closed. She may as well have been deaf.

Mireille bent down to the potted orchid sitting on the small table next 
to Kirika and began pouring water from the pitcher around its stalk, the 
soil turning a dark brown bordering on black as it was thoroughly 
saturated. A placid smile curved the woman&#39;s mouth while her eyes 
regarded her toil. &quot;You&#39;re liable to catch a cold standing there,&quot; 
Mireille remarked blithely without looking up, but there was nothing 
that was easygoing contained in her blue gaze. Stormy skies roiled 
there, tempests of thoughts and feelings pertaining to their imminent 
trip to Japan most likely, although they were probably a lot different 
from Kirika&#39;s own.

Kirika slipped her student card back into a pocket of her parka, almost 
having to pry her fingers from it, and then wordlessly pushed the two 
halves of the window closed, before latching it. She preferred to gaze 
at an unobstructed view of the sky, of the horizon, when she could, even 
if that obstruction was merely a glass pane. The vision was somehow... 
purer, more real, then. More sacred. And this morning she&#39;d really had a 
need to gaze. But Kirika wouldn&#39;t have laid a hand on the window earlier 
if her partner hadn&#39;t been off in the bedroom, where looming winter&#39;s 
bite spilling into their home couldn&#39;t quite pierce the woman&#39;s flesh. 
Yet even then, if they hadn&#39;t been departing the apartment soon the 
notion to open the window wouldn&#39;t have even entered Kirika&#39;s mind in 
the first place. Time would have eventually honed winter&#39;s fangs, after 
all. Now that Mireille had left the limited sanctuary of the 
bedroom--standing adjacent to her and the window no less--the girl had 
not dallied in shutting the window and ceasing the influx of frosty air. 
Mireille would have been liable to catch a cold, too.

Turning back to the blonde, Kirika saw that water had begun trickling 
out of the collection of holes drilled in the bottom of the orchid&#39;s pot 
and into the saucer that held it, having seeped all the way through the 
sodden earth above. Kirika looked on expressionlessly as Mireille 
continued to cascade water into the clay pot regardless, until the jug 
was dripping its last and the saucer was verging on overflowing. The 
darkhaired girl seen the practice before, aware that Mireille only gave 
the orchid a watering like that when she predicted that an assignment 
might last a week... if not longer. The sight and the grim realisation 
coupled with it did not help Kirika&#39;s already ailing morning spirits. 
Nor did it appear to please Mireille any, her smile tight on her face, 
it clearly being an effort to make it stick.

Mireille straightened and took the empty jug back to the kitchen to 
refill it, before giving the other plants in the apartment a similar, if 
lighter, watering treatment. After she was done, she put away the jug 
and performed a final check around the apartment, ensuring that 
everything was in order; that is to say that everything that should be 
hidden--ammunition clips and other questionable items--was hidden. The 
landlord hadn&#39;t ever poked around their home when they weren&#39;t in as far 
as Kirika knew, but Mireille didn&#39;t trust him at all it seemed, not even 
agreeing to let him water the plants while they were away. The young 
assassin supposed it was safer having that sort of mindset; if he 
happened to uncover anything he shouldn&#39;t in their absence, it would 
likely land her and her partner in a great deal of trouble. Trouble of 
the kind they would probably have to clean up with a whole heap of 
bullets.

As she watched Mireille bustle, Kirika felt an nearly overwhelming urge 
to tell the caring woman her woes; tell her how she&#39;d dreamt that bad 
dream again and remembered it this time, about the voice like Altena&#39;s 
that had whispered in her head, about the dark thoughts that had 
sometimes cropped up in her mind. But the urge was nothing new, and had 
already been curbed once before, when she and Mireille had been eating 
breakfast together earlier this morning. Kirika knew she could talk to 
her love about her private war, knew for a certainty that the blonde 
would listen attentively, be appreciative that she had shared, and 
provide as much support as she could... but the quiet girl also knew 
that Mireille could not help her. Not with this. Bad dreams were one 
thing, but this.... This fight was Kirika&#39;s alone. It always had been; 
her mind was a battlefield open to two specific combatants and no more. 
But alone she did feel in the struggle against her other self, yet 
despite that she chose not to drag her partner into it. She would not 
burden Mireille with something that would ultimately leave the woman 
feeling useless, and then later frustrated because she felt that way. 
No, there were no allies available in this conflict. It was just Kirika 
and the darkness. *Kirika&#39;s* darkness.

Her inspection apparently complete, Mireille came to a halt beside the 
end of the billiard table across from Kirika, her hands going to her 
hips. Following a moment of simply standing there, staring at the rack 
of billiard cues on the wall opposite with a distance look on her face, 
she raised her left arm to glance at the elegant gold watch strapped to 
her wrist, its face resting on her pulse point. An eyebrow rose in mild 
surprise at whatever time was displayed.

&quot;It&#39;s later than I thought,&quot; Mireille informed Kirika, before looking up 
at her. The girl wondered if her partner had lost track of time while 
she had been engrossed in picking out what clothes to pack in her 
suitcase. It had happened before. &quot;The taxi I arranged for should be 
here momentarily. We can wait downstairs for it, if you think you can 
brave the cold weather.&quot; The blonde threw Kirika a meaningful smile over 
the billiard table, one that said she knew perfectly fine how well the 
lean but resilient girl coped with the chill.

Kirika couldn&#39;t keep from smiling back just a tiny bit as she gave a 
little nod, in spite of her dismal mood. Mireille had that sort of 
affect on her, especially nowadays. She started to reconsider her 
decision to withhold her inner turmoil from the woman, but quickly 
arrived at the same conclusions as before. Still, it was nice to know 
that Mireille was there for her, if oblivious to her internal strife. 
Kirika took some comfort in that.

Mireille&#39;s smile became amused, its lustre captivating Kirika and 
holding her attention as well as her eyes as the beguiling angel it 
belonged to made her way towards the chair in front of her computer on 
the billiard table, where her packed laptop bag and greyish-brown coat 
lay, the latter slung over the chair&#39;s back. The blonde pulled on the 
coat, flicking her long tresses out over the collar to stream in a silky 
golden waterfall down her back, and then hung her black laptop bag by 
its strap on one shoulder. At this, Mireille&#39;s charm loosened the 
entrancing grip it had on Kirika enough for the once transfixed girl to 
remember--with a blink and some surprise--that she had a bag too, one 
she bent down and picked up, carrying it on her right hip with the 
yellow shoulder strap running crosswise over her body.

Mireille grabbed the handle of her nearby suitcase leaning against the 
black dividing wall, and then walked towards the front door, the 
suitcase trundling along the floor behind her on its two small wheels. 
Kirika suspected that she would be carting that suitcase around before 
they reached the check-in counter at the airport. She didn&#39;t really 
mind. It was a measure of how comfortable Mireille had become with 
Kirika that the blonde allowed her partner to carry her luggage for her. 
In the old days Mireille would have guarded her bags as if they were the 
refuge of secrets not for Kirika&#39;s eyes; the girl had not even dared to 
venture near them, let alone touch them. Nowadays nothing was off 
limits--luggage, shopping bags, groceries, and more, Kirika had ended up 
bearing at one point or another. It felt good to be useful, but even 
better to be helping Mireille.

Kirika followed after Mireille, but lingered at the mouth of the short 
hallway leading to the front door, turning back to survey the 
apartment--her and her partner&#39;s home--for one last time. It looked very 
quiet and empty, as if they had already left it days ago. Soft beams of 
sunlight fell through the windows, but not but a handful of dust motes 
danced in their midst, and their movements were slow, languid drifts 
that would eventually bring them all to land on floor or furniture. It 
was like everything in the apartment was going to sleep, breathing a 
final sigh before relaxing and settling in for a long wait. Awaiting 
Kirika and Mireille&#39;s return.

&quot;Kirika,&quot; Mireille gently beckoned, her melodious voice coaxing Kirika 
out her reverie.

Kirika turned around to see Mireille waiting for her, patiently holding 
the front door open with a hand on the dull silver doorknob, and trotted 
down the hallway and past the faintly smiling woman into the corridor 
outside the apartment. She couldn&#39;t stop herself looking back one more 
time, however, as Mireille began to close the front door. Looking down 
the hallway she had just traversed, Kirika caught sight of her and her 
partner&#39;s orchid resting on the table against the far wall of their 
home. She wondered if the orchid would dry out and wilt before they came 
back, in spite of Mireille&#39;s pains to prevent that happening. Kirika 
hoped it wouldn&#39;t.

The door clicked shut.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I decided not to name the Soldats council members and have sort of a 
SEELE (from Evangelion) mentality instead. I did consider having just 
&#39;disembodied&#39; voices (i.e. &quot;Council member one talks&quot;, then &quot;Council 
member two talks&quot;) but I felt that would get too confusing to the point 
no one would know who was actually speaking. I hope that scene was okay.

I have no idea how Mireille and Kirika transport their weapons and 
ammunition from country to country, so I kind of glossed over that part. 
I suppose they could always take their guns apart and mail the pieces to 
themselves at their overseas destination... but that would leave them 
defenceless for a while, and it couldn&#39;t be *that* easy. Oh well, let&#39;s 
just not dwell on it. ^.^

More on the first Noir and Kind Mother in coming chapters. Their tale 
would be a fun and interesting one to write, I think. Perhaps that&#39;s 
something for me to do in the future. ^_^
