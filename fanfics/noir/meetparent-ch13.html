<h1>Meet the Parent (part 13 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Mireille did not care how long had she and Kirika been in the caf&eacute;, 
sitting and now, crying. She ignored all the questioning looks the other 
passengers were giving them in a glimpse.

All she could hear was her lovers&#39; silent cry, for it drove the sad tear 
lullaby into her ears, slowly warming up the feeling of hatred down in 
her heart, pushing the need of vengeance roaring wildly in her soul, 
forcing her to even more despise her forever enemy, Soldats. Blinded by 
all devils&#39; heart, the only thing flashed to her eyes was Kirika&#39;s 
shaking shoulder while crying in her arms, face buried in her chest.

The only matter she could care to bother was the Japanese girl&#39;s pain, 
and how in the world could she ease it just a little, other and besides 
holding her body tightly, hugging her, stroking her back gently. How 
Mireille felt that she could kill herself now, only because she was the 
one bringing the horrific news to the brunette.

How she wanted to torture anyone responsible and dared to bring such 
pain to her lovers. She could feel her own hands trembling as she felt 
like dying to shoot dead that person. She wanted to kill Doctor Naomi. 
So badly she could feel her jaw tighten hardly.

But the truth she did not do it, or rather, had not. Mireille sighed, 
knowing that she actually couldn&#39;t do that. The thing that stopped her 
to do so was the little doubt in her heart, whether the female was truly 
the brunette&#39;s mother or not. No one knew what kind of guiltiness to 
feel, or redemption that she must asked, if the issue was also a lie. 
Another reason, the most important reason of the two, why she did not 
pull out her gun right away and rushed towards the female doctor was 
Kirika&#39;s feeling. Mireille knew that the Japanese girl would not yet 
allow anybody to kill her mother, regardless of how vague and unclear 
the situation was now.

Minutes passed quickly as Kirika spent all the time crying on the 
blonde&#39;s shoulder in almost flawless silent, despite her shaking body.

&quot;Kirika.. Sshh.. Calm down..&quot; soothed Mireille, tapping Kirika&#39;s back 
gently.

A while after, the Japanese girl whose brown eyes had become teary from 
before and all red, slowly regaining her calm. Few more soothing taps 
from Mireille, and finally Kirika drew her body out of her lovers&#39; 
embrace, and now looked up at the blonde.

&quot;..I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kirika whispered softly in a low voice. &quot;Made your 
clothes all wet..&quot;

It was now that Mireille looked at her clothes and realized how wet it 
had become. She smiled inwardly. Despite her silent cry, Kirika sure let 
out huge amount of tears.

Mireille asked softly, &quot;Do you feel much better now..?&quot;

Kirika nodded in silence. Mireille smiled in return. Then, the two 
trapped in silence, both just gazing onto each other eyes.

What should we do now.. It&#39;s almost out of question to kill that damn 
Naomi..!

Almost if their eyes were talking, Kirika whispered weakly, &quot;Is there 
any other way.. beside kill her..?&quot;

&quot;..I don&#39;t know.&quot; the blonde answered honestly. &quot;She sure is dangerous. 
But..&quot; Mireille paused. &quot;I.. have a little doubt that she isn&#39;t your 
mother, Kirika. Just a little.&quot;

To Mireille surprise, Kirika smiled at her. &quot;So do I.&quot; she said. &quot;Or 
rather Mireille.. I hope it is the truth.&quot;

&quot;Kirika..&quot; Mireille lowered her head. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry for not telling 
you quicker. Now we are trapped, if Naomi really isn&#39;t your mother. To 
tell you the truth, I was very shocked back then I couldn&#39;t make a 
plan.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mireille.&quot; said Kirika, her hands gently caressed the 
blonde&#39;s left cheek. &quot;As long as we are together.. we can face anything. 
Together.&quot;

The brunette&#39;s tone was so serious but at the same time comforting, it 
made Mireille looked up and smiled then let herself leaned over to hold 
her lovers in her arms. &quot;Sorry. And.. thank you Kirika. I&#39;m the one who 
supposed to cheer you up, aren&#39;t I..?&quot;

The Japanese girl nodded in spirit, showing her agreement.

&quot;So.. What do you think we can do..? Say that.. Doctor Naomi is 
Soldats.&quot;

&quot;We.. can&#39;t do anything.Yet.&quot;

&quot;..The reason?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;We are in a plane. It is.. risky. And involved people.&quot; claimed the 
Japanese girl.

Mireille nodded, as she actually had guessed about it. They were 
assassins, but not one without heart. Had they were one without 
affection and feeling, they would never feel love, much rather become 
lovers. When the case was one with innocent people had high possibility 
to be involved, both Mireille and Kirika would treat and thought about 
the progress carefully.

It was different matter with Soldats tough, especially for the blonde.

I hope they won&#39;t attack first.

&quot;..Right. One more thing, Kirika.&quot; Mireille let go of the embrace 
softly. &quot;Will we act like we don&#39;t know anything..? I&#39;ve tried my best 
to act like it today.&quot;

&quot;..Maybe.&quot; the brunette answered in a low voice.

Realizing the sadness in her lovers tone, Mireille felt like her heart 
was suddenly stabbed by million knifes. &quot;Well.. I guess we would better 
just do whatever safe for now.&quot;

Once we arrived in Japan, the truth will speak itself. But still, no 
guarantee of how dangerous it may be.

With that, both Mireille and Kirika head back to their seat in a 
complete disguise of their scattered feeling. It was kind of fortunate 
that they found Doctor Naomi was sleeping soundly in her seat so the 
blonde would not have to smile whole heartedly and ridiculously at the 
female vet all along.

Killing all heavy pressure she felt due to the need of acting innocent 
later, again, Mireille forced herself to relax and sleep. Kirika, on the 
other hand surprised her by fall asleep right away. Judgind from this, 
Mireille assumed that their act was pretty convincing so far to show 
that nothing had changed things between them and Doctor Naomi.

Felt that she was too stressed to sleep, Mireille stole a glance at the 
female vet&#39;s face. Blue eyes met the vision of some old, wise, innocent 
face sleeping.

Is she really.. Soldats..?

In the middle of her thought, Mireille abruptly felt that the air became 
kind of eerie and causing chill ran down her spine. Aware of the 
possibility of being attacked, the blonde stole a glance at every corner 
of the plane, quickly analyzing the situation. Everytime she heard or 
felt anything that brought her an ominous feeling, she spontaneously 
touched and hold her gun. Minutes in extreme cautious, Mireille almost 
jumped when she suddenly heard the speaker boomed out the voice of the 
air plane&#39;s captain, telling them that they would land in ten minutes.

Ten minutes..? How long have I been awake, then..

Mireille unconsciously yawned and sighed in exhaustion.

Twenty five minutes later, Mireille, Kirika and Doctor Naomi had walked 
out of the plane, now inside the airport hall. The blonde yawned once 
again, rather than looking in excitement of being in Japan like other 
tourists did. Despite her tired and lazy physical look, and jet lag, the 
Corsican girl still watched every move Doctor Naomi made, from the 
corner of her eyes. She was ready anytime if there would be an assault, 
not to mention how sleepy she actually was.

&quot;We&#39;re back..!&quot; Doctor Naomi stated happily as the three of them walked. 
&quot;How I miss this country..! Kirika.. This is our hometown..!&quot;

Kirika nodded obediently as an answer.

&quot;Oh.. Let&#39;s pick up the luggage, girls.&quot; said the female vet, smiling.

&quot;Mireille. You looked.. tired.&quot; Kirika said as they stepped out of the 
crowd to take their belongings. Worried, she touched the blonde&#39;s hand 
and squeezed it softly.

&quot;Uh.. Yes.&quot; mumbled Mireille. She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she 
really was out of energy.

How can I sleep peacefully.. It amazed me that that damn Naomi slept 
like a rock..!!

&quot;I rest almost all the time.&quot; Dr. Naomi suddenly joined their small 
conversation cheerfully, as she took her bag. &quot;You should have done it 
too, Mireille.&quot;

&quot;..Yeah.&quot;

Who caused it to me in first place..?!?!

As soon as the three of them finished with picking up the luggage, 
Mireille obediently followed Dr. Naomi and Kirika, while yawned all 
over. All the blonde wanted was to lie down in a soft place and rest her 
sleepy head.

&quot;Mireille, have you got an apartment..?&quot; asked Doctor Naomi.

&quot;..Yes.&quot; answered the Corsican girl lazily. Lazy she would seem, but her 
instinct and mind still kept the best part of her consciousness awake to 
protect Kirika.

&quot;Oh, really..?&quot;

The blonde nodded slowly. A friend of hers had offered an apartment 
somewhere in Japan, which she took right away, regardless of what 
condition the apartment was in, as she was in confusion and fully 
occupied by the issue of Dr. Naomi. The only thing she remembered was 
that the apartment had enough beds for a full family. That one meant 
that she could share it together with Kirika.

Kirika.

Something&#39;s bothering her mind. Mireille forced her sleepy brain&#39;s 
engine to work and think. When she came to realize what exactly that 
bothering her mind, the blonde&#39;s blue eyes opened up wider.

Wait! Do I have to be separated from her now..?!

As the blonde was about to ask her question, she heard the female vet 
asked softly, &quot;How about we spend one night at your place, Mireille..?&quot;

&quot;..Eh? What about your family, Doctor..?&quot; retorted Mireille, once again 
became cautious. &quot;Won&#39;t anybody.. come to pick you up..?&quot; Her hand 
slowly reached her hidden gun in her pocket.

There&#39;s no such thing as old secret and oh so cool bodyguard family, 
admit it..!!

&quot;No. We have to travel ourselves to go to the family house. But, it&#39;s 
too far for us to reach it today. We all tired and got jet lag, and it&#39;s 
already night.&quot; said Doctor Naomi calmly. &quot;Mireille, do you mind if.. we 
stay..?&quot;

&quot;No. Not at all.&quot;

The female vet smiled in appreciation. &quot;Let&#39;s take a cab, then. You have 
the address..?&quot;

------------------

One hour traveling with the taxi, the three of them finally arrived at 
the destination. As soon as they got out from the cab, Mireille rushed 
towards in and set all of administration and payment needed. Then, the 
three of them brought all luggage upstairs to the blonde&#39;s new room.

Mireille unlocked the door quickly and marched in. The room, which 
painted in cream colour, was quite nice and modern, and huge enough even 
for three person. There was a sofa, magnificent window, a big flat TV 
hanging on the wall, kitchen, three rooms, and two bathrooms, as far as 
the blonde was concern.

Mireille was tired and sleepy as hell, but she knew that she could not 
let Kirika&#39;s safety be neglected. Fortunately, her senses generously 
still worked to avoid her from sleeping right away. Being well 
experienced at killing people, the Corsican girl knew that one of the 
best time to attack her, of all condition, was now, at night. Tonight. 
When she and Kirika felt sleepy and a bit unhealthy from jet lag.

She looked at Doctor Naomi, who was somehow fascinated by the kitchen 
and busy looking around the apartment. No sign of sudden attack from her 
at all. A feeling of doubt once again flowing inside the blonde&#39;s heart. 
No need to tell what caused it.

&quot;Mireille..&quot;

Hearing the soft voice calling her name, the blonde turned her back and 
saw her dearest friend was looking at her. &quot;What is it, Kirika?&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you.. go to sleep?&quot; asked the Japanese girl. &quot;You are 
tired..&quot;

The blonde couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;Ah. I&#39;m okay.&quot;

Who knows what will Naomi or anyone do when I&#39;m sleeping..?

Kirika, hearing her lovers answer moved closer, approaching the blonde. 
&quot;Mireille.. You&#39;re tired.&quot; she touched Mireille&#39;s hand. &quot;Go to bed. 
We&#39;re okay.&quot; she whispered in a very low voice.

&quot;I&#151;&quot;
&quot;Just sleep, Mireille.&quot;

Ignoring how pushy the Japanese girl was, Mireille narrowed her eyes 
slightly, showing her determination. &quot;..We must watch her, Kirika.&quot; the 
blonde whispered softly, only to be heard by Kirika. She looked at the 
female vet to ensure the safe distance between them and added, &quot;She or 
any Soldats may attack anytime. And it&#39;s possible that they&#39;ll do it 
tonight.&quot;

If only I have thought of a plan.. Kirika won&#39;t suffer and I will have a 
better prediction of how Soldats will really act.

The next moment, a sad expression of Kirika flashed on Mireille&#39;s blue 
orbs. The brunette seemed to loose her firm gaze, as her eyes stared in 
blank, utterly spacing out.

Mireille waved her hands upon the Japanese girl&#39;s head. &quot;Kirika..? 
Kirika!&quot;

The Japanese girl&#39;s eyes widen, startled. &quot;Sorry, Mireille..&quot;

The blonde heaved out a long sigh. Had Doctor Naomi not become this 
close with Kirika, the brunette would not have to feel such burden to 
trust Chloe&#39;s word, and her own feeling. It&#39;s painful for her to watch 
over Naomi. She still.. trusts her.

Mireille lengthen her arms and pulled the brunette&#39;s small feature to 
her, embracing her into a caressing hug. &quot;..Don&#39;t ever come to any 
preposterous conclusion and somehow blame yourself.&quot;

The Japanese girl squeaked but said nothing and leaned deeper into the 
blonde&#39;s body.

They remained in same position, holding tight to each other in silence 
for a while, both enjoying the soft scene and existence of their 
partners.

&quot;You know.. I may fall asleep right now with you be my pillow forever.&quot; 
teased Mireille.

The brunette blushed shyly and remained quiet, as the blonde looked in 
amusement at her. Then, Mireille yawned once again, made the Japanese 
girl looked up at her, her cheeks still flushing in crimson.

&quot;I can watch her.. for you.&quot; whispered Kirika. &quot;So you can sleep, 
Mireille.&quot;

Mireille raised her eyebrows. &quot;..Are you sure? Aren&#39;t you tired as 
well?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Leave it to me.&quot;

Amusingly tempted by the offer, the blonde smiled at the Japanese girl. 
Mireille leaned over and quickly gave Kirika a peck on the lips, causing 
the brunette&#39;s tensed slightly and even blushed more furiously at the 
sudden action. &quot;Thank you. Be careful, will you? Oh, and wake me up when 
you are tired and sleepy. We&#39;ll change.&quot;

The latter nodded slowly as a reply.

Then, Mireille walked towards the female vet, ignoring the haunted and 
creepy feeling she had since in the airplane, more overly, her doubting 
feeling towards the oldest woman of the three.

&quot;Doctor Naomi, I will take a rest in that room.&quot; Mireille pointed at one 
room at her right. &quot;You can wake me up if something happens.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; she said smiling, still paying her full attention at the 
kitchen. &quot;Goodnight.&quot;

&quot;..Goodnight, Doctor.&quot;

---------------------------------------

The sun had rise, a sign to mark the beginning of the day, the time when 
morning persons used to wake up. In that case, Mireille was one of them, 
as she woke up first the following morning. She opened her eyes slowly 
and looked around in her bed, tried to remember why she was here, and 
why she felt unfamiliar with the air she breathed in the room right now. 
And why Kirika was not sleeping beside her.

Once she remembered, which pretty fast, she jumped out of the bed and 
rushed to take her gun. Out of vigilance, she knew, but she must be 
cautious anytime. She opened her bedroom door, and stepped in the living 
room, both hands holding her gun. Yet there was no one nor anything 
suspicious in her apartment. No broken windows, battered doors, or 
scattered glasses.

That meant there was no invasion last night. Sighing in relief, Mireille 
hoped inwardly that everything was as alright as it seemed to be. She 
recalled that no one woke her up last night, either Kirika or any 
strange sound. She desperately hoped and prayed in her mind that the 
Japanese girl did have a good reason for not doing it.

There were three other rooms beside the one she used to sleep in. Her 
eyes wandered quickly through the room and found two doors near where 
she stood were closed.

The blonde run without noise and stopped at the first nearest door. She 
opened it up slowly, and stole a peek at the sight of Doctor Naomi lied 
wildly in her bed. The female vet sure looked like she was having a 
weird dream, as her hands were punching the air. Mireille almost laughed 
when she saw it. She closed the door without sound, and headed to the 
other door.

The door was unlocked. Mireille opened it slowly, and smiled as she 
found her lovers laying in bed peacefully, hugging the pillows with both 
her tiny arms.

Thanks God she&#39;s okay..

The scene somehow was so amusing it made the Corsican girl lowered her 
gun and unconsciously stood grinning afterwards, without moving. Then, 
Mireille turned her back and marched to the window, decided that she 
didn&#39;t have the heart to wake Kirika up just now. She looked outside, 
down at the road, noticing that the apartment room she stayed in was 
quite high on the floor to see people looked like ants in a crowd.

We&#39;re in Japan, eh? So far there&#39;s nothing happened..

Mireille sighed once again as she watched the sky. Suddenly, she felt 
her ears spotted something. Her body tensed as she realized someone&#39;s 
footstep. Instinctively, the blonde sensed danger and turned her back 
quickly while pulled out her gun.

The blonde gasped at the sight. She saw Doctor Naomi pointed a gun right 
at her. Had the looks of the doctor&#39;s eyes were the same as usual, the 
blonde could still only guess that Doctor Naomi was kidding and just 
playing with gun around. But unfortunately, the look of the person 
staring at her right now was freezing cold. Not the usual happy, 
friendly and cheerful look.

&quot;Morning, Mireille.&quot; Doctor Naomi greeted Mireille, her smile turned 
somewhat sadistic it reminded the blonde of some cool-blooded killer.

&quot;You..&quot; was all the Corsican girl could say as she was too shocked and 
surprised. She was sure that she saw the doctor was still sleeping back 
then.

&quot;Nice to meet you in the morning.&quot; the female vet whispered coldly in a 
low voice.

The blonde felt a sweat dropped from her forehead.

I&#39;m too careless. She&#39;s really dangerous. She got behind me once more.

Mireille didn&#39;t move, and so did Doctor Naomi. As the distance between 
them was no more than two meters it was easy to just pull out the 
trigger right away, tough none of them considering to do so yet, and 
rather looking at each other sharply.

&quot;So you really are Soldats, huh?&quot; asked Mireille roughly. &quot;Where are 
your other companions? I don&#39;t see them.&quot;

Doctor Naomi laughed disgustingly. &quot;Companions? I don&#39;t feel the need of 
them right now.&quot;

What is she planning to do?

Mireille narrowed her eyes suspiciously. &quot;We can settle this without 
harming each other.&quot; she stated calmly, tough she herself was not sure 
that she wanted to do what she just said.

I have to make noises so Kirika will wake up.

&quot;Oh..? You think so?&quot; Doctor Naomi said patronizingly. &quot;What if I don&#39;t 
want to?&quot;

&quot;..I really misjudged you.&quot; retorted the blonde, now grasped her gun 
very tightly.

The next action happened very fast. Doctor Naomi pulled out the trigger 
and launched one bullet right at the Corsican girl. The blonde was very 
lucky she could dodge the first attack, as she rolled over to her right, 
now run to Kirika&#39;s bedroom. Right before she rushed in the bedroom, 
another shot was directed at Mireille&#39;s back. Once again it was neatly 
dodged as the door was then slammed over to another side by the blonde, 
blocking the attack for sometime.

Mireille tapped and shook the Japanese girl&#39;s body fiercely, hoping the 
latter to quickly get conscious. Too bad, Doctor Naomi was already 
standing inside the room and shot her again. This time the bullet flew 
directly deep at Mireille&#39;s left arm as the blonde was late to dodge. 
Ignoring the wound that reopened in her left arm thanks to the shot, 
Mireille jumped at the other side of the bed, while shot twice at the 
fake vet.

Mireille shook the bed furiously with her right arms during the silence 
time. It gave no effect, as not even a move was made by her lovers. The 
Japanese girl still sleeping despite all effort the blonde had tried in 
the urgent situation.

&quot;She won&#39;t wake up.&quot; Doctor Naomi said mockingly. Her voice was vaguely 
audible as she also hided herself behind the door.

A wave of worry slipped upon her heart. From the steady breath the 
brunette did, Mireille knew that her love was not dead. But realizing 
that Kirika did really not wake up, Mireille found herself frustrated 
and feared something horrible was done to the Japanese girl.

What did she do to her? And how did she do it, for goodness sake?!

Mireille used the opportunity gap she found to shoot the female Soldats 
again. The fake female vet, a bit startled as she seemed to be, shot 
back at the blonde after dodging the third bullet directed at her.

She doesn&#39;t shoot Kirika. That&#39;s good.

Mireille was aware of the feeling of pain that stink in her left arm. 
Fresh blood could be seen now flowing out from the wound. She had lost a 
pretty good amount of blood.

I must kill her. Now.

As Doctor Naomi shot more just then and more precisely, the blonde 
carefully laid her body until her head could kiss the floor. She knew 
she had a handy knife somewhere in her dress. Mireille found it and 
smiled.

I&#39;ll only get one chance to do this.

The Corsican girl waited for some seconds, before made an opening by 
shoot at the female Soldats. The older woman jumped back slightly at the 
sudden attack, one reaction Mireille exactly needed. The blonde stood up 
and jumped while threw her knife right at Doctor Naomi&#39;s chest. Pretty 
knowledgeable by how to throw knife thanks to Chloe, the knife somehow 
stabbed right in.

The fake doctor cried in agony, and fall on the floor, hands trying to 
pull out the knife. Deep hatred filled her head, mind, and body, 
Mireille shot once again at the woman&#39;s upper breast. Losing her breath 
due to the strict situation, the blonde dropped herself to the floor.

That will be enough.

The defeated female Soldats used her left hand to crawl, trying to shoot 
Mireille one more time with all her might. Unfortunately she stopped 
moving right before she pulled out the trigger. Mireille, unusually 
trembling, glanced at the fake vet, then at her lovers who still 
sleeping in her comfortable bed.

I&#39;m sorry, Kirika.

Mireille did not get the chance to laugh over the fake doctor&#39;s dead, as 
she realized plenty footsteps were coming through her direction. The 
gun&#39;s booming sound was not something you could miss to notice, after 
all. There was possibility that the owner of anyone responsible in this 
building would come over and gave her a curios visit. Still holding her 
gun in both her hands, the blonde stood up, and stepped over the female 
Soldats body, now walking to the front door.

The blonde&#39;s eyes widen in mix of fear and exasperation as she spotted 
something strange. It was too silence. Just then, she could hear silence 
whisper of people and sound of rushing footsteps outside her apartment&#39;s 
door. That would not be a friend, she knew.

She said she didn&#39;t need comrades.

Mireille was about to hide herself and rushed right into Kirika&#39;s room, 
but failed miserably for her head was suddenly hit by something hard 
just when she turned around.

The act made her felt dizzy, but her strength was still enough to looked 
up and saw who did it to her. Then, the blonde felt the same hard thing 
was punched at her face, causing blood jerked out fiercely from her 
lips.

No way..

Mireille couldn&#39;t resist the feeling that her head was spinning around 
and made everything beyond her vision was blurry. She spotted her enemy 
from the corner of her eye. Naomi.

&quot;Don&#39;t think you can kill me so easily.&quot; was the last words Mireille 
could hear before she sank deep in a hole of blackness.</pre>
