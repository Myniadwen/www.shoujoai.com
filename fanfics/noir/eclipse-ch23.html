<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>I lay on the bed sideways, looking at the picture of the nightmare room. 
My head is full of thoughts, overunning each other like wild vines, 
twisting into nowhere. Was I taken from the abbey? The book- why did I 
make such a promise? Especially with the warning don&#39;t let him destroy 
you. Frere Mueller had started to say something- was it my real name? My 
name... could it really be Anna?

&quot;Anna...&quot; I say it out loud, trying to see if it fits. I look at the 
picture on the wall. &quot;Anna- what happened there?&quot;

My thoughts are interrupted by the sounds of Mireille and Uncle arguing 
again. I hear the bedroom door slam behind me and I turn my head to look 
at her. She looks at me and shakes her head. Sitting down heavily on the 
bed, she takes off her boots and throws them against the closet door.

&quot;Still not speaking?&quot; she twists back around for a moment, then snorts 
in disgust. &quot;Fine. You&#39;re just as crazy as he is. No wonder the two of 
you get along.&quot;

I feel a surge of anger well up in me, but refuse to respond. I don&#39;t 
want to get into a fight about Uncle again.

I roll to my side so I can watch her get ready for bed. Her movements 
are shortened by anger; she jerks her nightshirt down over her body 
quickly, returning my gaze without speaking.

She turns and stuffs her boots into the closet, then slides the doors 
shut. She leans on the door and sighs.

&quot;You used to look at me differently... I guess the honeymoon&#39;s over.&quot; 
The anger is gone from her voice. She walks to the nightstand and picks 
up her purse.

&quot;What- what does that mean?&quot; I ask, shocked.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; She opens her purse and takes out the telegram from Droger, 
reading it again. She closes her eyes and shakes her head.

&quot;Nothing...just foolishness.&quot;</pre>
