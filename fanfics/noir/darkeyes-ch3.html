<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>It was lonely in the apartment by herself.

Kirika lay back in her customary place on the bed, hands folded behind 
her dark, tousled head as she stared up at the ceiling. Realistically, 
she knew it was foolish to feel lonely at this point. She&#39;d been in the 
apartment by herself before, sometimes for hours, when Mirelle went out 
to do things on her own. It wasn&#39;t as if she were helpless. She knew how 
to cook and order delivery food, she had money available for anything 
she wanted to get or do, and if it came down to it, she was more than 
capable of defending herself against anything that might come after her. 
With nothing pressing to do and no job that required her attention, she 
was free to do whatever she wanted. For most ordinary people, she was 
fairly certain this would be paradise. Besides, Mirelle hadn&#39;t even been 
gone for more than two hours.

But realism had nothing to do with the faint ache in her chest, the odd 
feeling curled in the pit of her stomach like a small, shivering animal. 
This time was different than any time before, and though she might be 
able to fool her mind, her body knew the truth. Mirelle wouldn&#39;t just be 
gone for a few hours, to come striding through the door with a smile and 
that softening hint of warmth in her eyes. She would be gone for three 
or four days, away in a place that Kirika couldn&#39;t follow and couldn&#39;t 
protect her. The time stretching before the Japanese assassin was like 
an endless nothing, an empty space of worry where she would be forced to 
exist until her partner returned and life resumed.

With a sigh, the young woman rolled over on her side, rust-red gaze 
falling on a small, simply potted plant perched atop a stand near the 
dresser. Yellow and blue blooms peeked in patches through the leafy 
green foliage, and Kirika smiled slightly. These flowers were only some 
of several that now spread tastefully throughout the apartment, a soft 
riot of complimentary colors tucked in niches and settled on 
windowsills. Mirelle had ordered them on the internet while Kirika was 
recuperating, having them delivered downstairs to make sure she didn&#39;t 
have to leave her wounded partner&#39;s side for more than a few minutes. 
The Japanese assassin could vividly remember waking from one of her 
worst days, sick and aching, only to see a multitude of new blossoms and 
green shoots arranged at the foot of the bed on a fold-out table. 
Mirelle had been standing behind them, a hint of shyness in the wry 
smile that curved her lips. &quot;I figured &#150; maybe we could use another 
orchid.&quot; Her eyes had danced, the light in them somewhere between 
playful and amused. &quot;A few of them. And some bluebells, and some of 
these little violet ones. What do you think?&quot;

They had spent the next several hours happily deciding which plant went 
where, with Mirelle patiently shifting the pots while Kirika sat on the 
couch, propped up on pillows so her weakened stomach muscles wouldn&#39;t 
have to work as hard to keep her upright. In the present, Kirika&#39;s eyes 
brightened, remembering her partner&#39;s silvery laughter. &quot;We&#39;ll have a 
mini-forest in this window if we add a single new bush . . . what about 
this sill instead? Maybe we should put the blue-and-white ones on this 
ledge, and then we can move the yellow over here. What do you think, 
Kirika? Or do you like the purple ones here instead?&quot;

The remembered voice echoing in her head was enough to sooth her pained 
loneliness, if only for a moment. Kirika sat up, pleating the edge of 
the bed sheets absently between her fingers as she stared out the window 
with unseeing eyes. She knew, in part, why Mirelle had gone on this job 
alone, even though the target and the circumstances repulsed her. Things 
between the two of them were . . . strange, to say the least. After the 
horror of blood and death that marked their return from the Manor, 
Kirika had still been slightly afraid that Mirelle wouldn&#39;t want her 
around. That even after begging her to live, pulling her from the fiery 
abyss and oblivion of death, the blonde would want her to go her own way 
now that the trials were ended and their pasts revealed. When the 
Corsican beauty had soberly admitted she couldn&#39;t imagine living without 
her, Kirika&#39;s heart had nearly pounded from her chest in joy. The only 
person she cared for, the one she wanted to stay beside always, wanted 
the very same thing, felt the same thing! It was the most perfect ending 
she could imagine, a faerie tale she would never have dreamed she could 
have for herself.

Of course, it hadn&#39;t worked out quite as wonderfully as a true faerie 
tale. Pulling a pillow to her chest, Kirika sighed, delicate pointed 
chin resting atop the thick softness. In some ways, their relationship 
was almost the same as before &#150; the comfortable silences, anticipating 
each other&#39;s moods, the two of them reacting to each other with liquid 
perfection on a hit. And the tea they drank, preparing dinner together, 
even the teasing glances and gently mocking eyes Mirelle seemed to turn 
on her partner whenever she found the opportunity. In some ways, it was 
even better. Mirelle asked about most jobs now, wanting her opinions 
instead of simply choosing for them; she had taken a deep interest in 
making sure Kirika knew about a normal life, even if they couldn&#39;t 
really have one of their own, and she seemed to love encouraging the 
small hobbies the Japanese young woman had shyly developed. She didn&#39;t 
seem to have a problem in touching Kirika now, either.

But in some ways, everything was even more uncertain than before. 
Setting aside the pillow again, the dark-haired girl slipped off the 
bed, padding bare-footed down the small set of steps to the apartment 
proper. Before she&#39;d gone to the Manor, her sometimes strange reactions 
to Mirelle weren&#39;t important. She hadn&#39;t understood them, but at the 
time, it hadn&#39;t mattered; after all, the blonde Corsican had planned and 
promised to kill her once they uncovered the secrets of their shared 
past. Now that it was all behind them, though, every random stomach 
flutter, every small shock of heat and jolt of muscle weakness seemed 
new, exciting and confusing. Even worse were the emotions that invaded 
her heart and mind, even when they were on a job. The absolute elation 
that filled her when Mirelle voiced one of her rare compliments, the shy 
flaming blush at each gentle tease, the crushing worry that stuffed her 
heart in her throat if she thought Mirelle was in danger &#150; she had no 
idea what they might mean, or even if they were normal for someone in 
their situation. As if there was a normal for their situation.

Mind elsewhere, Kirika picked up the teapot and filled it at the sink, 
hands moving absently in the same familiar routines they had followed 
more than a million times before. Although she had tried to explain her 
tangled feelings in the letter she&#39;d left Mirelle, she was sure she&#39;d 
failed miserably in that area. The blonde hadn&#39;t said a word about any 
of it since they returned, other than admitting she&#39;d found the paper, 
and Kirika knew from the steely look in those sapphire eyes that 
bringing it up would be a very bad idea. Though who did that leave for 
her to ask? It was ironic, the Japanese assassin reflected as she pulled 
open one of the cupboard doors, that she knew so much about obscure and 
specialized things, yet so little about common, ordinary life. She could 
turn any item into a deadly weapon and kill with her bare hands, and she 
was an accomplished field surgeon, tracker, hunter and spy. Her memory 
was nearly perfect, she spoke more than a dozen different languages 
fluently, and she knew her intelligence was quite above average, 
especially for her age. But still, the most basic, integral parts of 
society seemed bent on eluding her grasp.

So where did a once amnesiac-assassin go to get information she couldn&#39;t 
ask her partner?

With a sigh, young woman tossed the wrappings of her tea bags in the 
trash. She supposed there was a bright side to the enforced separation. 
Without her reactions or any jobs to distract her, perhaps she could 
finally get to the bottom of their mystery. She knew how to get to the 
biblioth&egrave;que publique &#150; between the books and computers there, she was 
fairly sure she&#39;d be able to find something that matched the physical 
symptoms, if not the emotional ones. She would get a handle on this, and 
everything would be fine &#150;

Turning back to her finished concoction, Kirika stopped dead, one hand 
still frozen in mid-motion. Settled on the smooth countertop in their 
usual places, two full teacups glinted mockingly in the overhead lights, 
their reddish-brown depths topped with small, swirling white plumes of 
steam. The younger woman&#39;s stomach clenched, tight and painful. Even 
without checking, she knew one had two sugar cubes and just a dash of 
cream, the other a single cube and more cream. The second was hers &#150; the 
first, Mirelle&#39;s.

Lips pressed hard together, Kirika spun sharply and stalked out of the 
kitchen, pausing only long enough to gather socks, shoes, jacket and a 
small backpack from their customary places. A few moments later, the 
front door not-quite-slammed shut, leaving the small, aching glimmer of 
normality behind.

These next few days were going to be hell.

--------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;m still not sure &#150; is there a difference between &#150; well what about 
this brush size?&quot;

Random, disconnected snippets of conversation flowed around the Japanese 
young woman as she slipped smoothly through the wide, spacious aisle of 
the new art store, her small, well-dressed frame mostly unnoticed by the 
various patrons. A pale brown coat of soft leather, its inside lined 
with wool, went down to about mid-thigh; a pair of fitting, light blue 
jeans, deep green T-shirt, and brown leather hightops in a slightly 
darker shade completed her outfit. Kirika wasn&#39;t quite sure how to feel 
about her clothes. She knew they made her look nice, as Mirelle had 
helped her pick them out. Partly, that thought made her chest ache, 
reminding her all over again that she was alone. But it also made her 
feel protected, safe, wrapped in these garments the Corsican had 
specially chosen. Her backpack was cream-colored, with two pockets and a 
bottom of durable leather, currently half-filled with sketchbooks, 
painting supplies and colored pencils. It had seen quite a bit of action 
in the last few weeks, as the young assassin and her partner had 
searched out new places for her to sketch.

Pausing in front of a large display on pastels, Kirika picked up a deep, 
dark purple and examined it, noting the slight coolness and solidity of 
the shade. Mirelle had never quite understood that part, the way Kirika 
would hesitate and ponder over dozens of &#145;identical&#39; colors before 
selecting one that seemed exactly the same as the four next to it. The 
younger woman couldn&#39;t really explain it, either, and after the first 
few tries, she&#39;d given up. She simply saw something in the different 
shadings and tints, things that seemed to make a color appear warmer or 
colder, firmer or more fluid than another.

After a few moments of thought, the Japanese girl shook her head and 
returned the lean, rectangular block to its box. No, it wasn&#39;t quite 
right. She wanted something warmer for the edges of the orchid&#39;s 
shadows, something to capture the soft glow of the afternoon sun that 
had been streaming through the window when she first sketched the 
picture. Leaning forward to pick up another color, a sudden flutter of 
plain white at the corner of her eye caught her attention. Surprised, 
Kirika turned, eyes tracking the motion automatically. Oddly enough, it 
was a loose piece of ordinary, computer-printer paper, floating down as 
though someone had dropped it to the floor while walking. There appeared 
to be something drawn on the bottom side, with several small lead 
smudges on the back that looked like finger marks. A thoughtful frown 
touched the young woman&#39;s face as she bent to pick up the sketch. Who 
had it come from?

Flipping the paper over, she stared. It was beautiful. Whoever had done 
this was obviously an above average artist &#150; even for a pencil sketch, 
it fairly shouted depth and complexity. The piece seemed to be a 
still-life of a tree planted outdoors, dappled sunlight glowing through 
the leafy branches and a wrought-iron fence bordering the trunk. Etched 
paving stones making up the ground suggested that it had been sketched 
at some sort of boutique mall, maybe near the canals, if the small 
grassy area behind it was the bank. The whole sketch seemed to have been 
done in mechanical pencil. But who could have done this? Kirika 
straightened, looking around for a likely owner. Two teenage girls &#150; 
obviously foreigners, judging by the tourist-style berets and 
over-giggly attitudes &#150; were chattering to each other in English and 
with one of the employees in stilted, heavily-accented French. She 
didn&#39;t think this gem could belong to one of them. A young boy and his 
mother were speaking with another store-worker about some kind of school 
project, the child wriggling with glee as he pointed out this or that 
type of poster board. Definitely not them, either. An older man stood 
with his arms folded in front of the paints, glowering at the selection 
of brushes with an almost stereotypical scowl. Kirika doubted he had the 
personality to draw something like the gorgeous snippet of art in her 
hand, even if he&#39;d had the ability. No, it wasn&#39;t any of them. But who?

Her gaze finally caught a lean, athletic-looking young man, just about 
Mirelle&#39;s age, paused in front of a stand of colored pencils in the next 
aisle. With his back to her, Kirika could only see his rich, oak brown 
hair &#150; short, almost a crewcut, with faint golden highlights &#150; and the 
lightly-tanned skin at his neck and hands. He wore a dark, fashionable 
sweater and simple blue jeans, a messenger bag slung casually over one 
shoulder, and a rather battered sketchpad was tucked in the crook of his 
arm. Several loose papers stuck out at different angles from between the 
book&#39;s cardboard covers, some with the slightly ratted edges from being 
torn out of another pad, some the plain computer-printer kind like the 
one in Kirika&#39;s hand. Judging from what she could see of the sketches on 
them, this was definitely the artist she was looking for. Apparently, he 
hadn&#39;t realized this one had fallen out. &quot;Excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; The young man turned, smiling slightly, and Kirika automatically 
noted his square chin, the well-chiseled features and wide, full mouth 
that seemed to calm a nervousness she hadn&#39;t even realized she felt. His 
eyes were green, a deep wood shade, with just a hint of brown in their 
depths. Feeling oddly caught for a moment, she blinked and shyly held 
out the paper. As usual, her French was flawless. &quot;I think you dropped 
this.&quot;

Now it was his turn to blink, open gaze shifting from her face to the 
sketch in her hand with a look of surprised relief. &quot;Oh!&quot; His smile 
widened gratefully, and one hand rose to gently take the paper back. 
&quot;Thank you so much &#150; I didn&#39;t even know I lost it!&quot;

Kirika couldn&#39;t help but smile back, just slightly. The young man 
shifted his sketchbook in his arm, lifting the plain cover and tucking 
the sketch carefully back inside. &quot;I just finished this one, and I 
hadn&#39;t had a chance to add the ink yet. I was thinking about using the 
new Micron pens from America. Have you ever tried those?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kirika shook her head, cheeks faintly pink and uncomfortable at 
the casual conversation. She&#39;d gotten a little better at speaking with 
people she didn&#39;t know since the Manor, but it was still rather 
unsettling. Glancing up at her face, the artist looked suddenly 
embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry &#150; I didn&#39;t even introduce myself. My name&#39;s 
Alexander Hollinder, Alex.&quot; He held out his free hand, smiling 
sheepishly. &quot;What&#39;s yours?&quot;

&quot;Kirika.&quot; The Japanese assassin responded without thinking, still 
slightly rattled at the cheerful openness in the young man. Alex&#39;s grin 
widened, apparently not noticing the girl&#39;s discomfort. &quot;Hello, Kirika. 
Thank you again. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if I lost this.&quot; Glancing up 
at her backpack, his eyes danced. &quot;Are you an artist too?&quot;

Kirika nodded now, though she made no move toward her own sketches. She 
didn&#39;t catch any suspicious air about this boy, but it never hurt to be 
cautious, and it could hurt quite a lot if she wasn&#39;t. For a moment, the 
face of Milosh &#150; lost forever to the world of light &#150; flashed through 
her mind. Alexander didn&#39;t seem to mind her reservations, though, his 
own face bright with pleasure at finding a fellow worshiper of the arts. 
He gestured toward the display he&#39;d been looking at. &quot;I like to use 
colored pencils for different highlights sometimes. You know, the softer 
light shines, that kind of thing.&quot;

Turning, he picked up a middling green pencil from the racks, eyeing it 
critically before shaking his head and putting it back. &quot;Of course, I&#39;m 
a bit picky about the colors. Like this one &#150; it&#39;s a nice, solid shade, 
but too dusty for the leaves and grass. They need something more 
vibrant, a little warmer.&quot;

&quot;More like this one.&quot; Kirika reached forward and plucked another of the 
emerald pencils from the display, half-turning to offer it for the 
artist&#39;s inspection before blushing and ducking her head. She hadn&#39;t 
meant to be that forward. Alex, on the other hand, beamed and nodded. 
&quot;Perfect!&quot; He laughed, self-deprecating. &quot;Usually when I say things like 
that, people look at me like I&#39;m crazy.&quot;

Kirika nodded, still flushing a bit, but surprised to find someone who 
agreed with her. Alex shifted his book again and flipped it back open to 
the sketch Kirika had seen, glancing to the side with a grin. &quot;What do 
you think for the sun on this bark here? The ridges are always a problem 
for me.&quot;

Hesitating, Kirika wondered if there was any way to politely excuse 
herself. She knew better than to get into personal conversations with 
people &#150; in her line of work, it wasn&#39;t done. Still &#150; turning back to 
the display, she trailed her fingers along the browns, finally pausing 
at a reddish one that seemed to have hints of deep mahogany. &quot;I &#150; I 
think this one will work. It&#39;s a redwood, right?&quot;

Alexander nodded, still pleased. &quot;Just the one I wanted.&quot; Holding up the 
pencil next to it, he explained, &quot;I always get ones that&#39;re too dark, 
never realize it until it&#39;s too late.&quot; He tucked the two pencils they&#39;d 
chosen into his free hand, plucking a couple more from the stand with 
quick precision. &quot;This is great.&quot;

He might have said more, but a movement at the front of the store caught 
his eye. Looking up, Kirika realized a teenage girl standing there was 
motioning at him, gray eyes impatient in a porcelain face framed by 
long, straight blonde hair. Her full mouth was turned down slightly at 
the corners, a faint but unmistakable frown. Alexander sighed. &quot;Damn.&quot;

Shaking his head, the young man snagged a few ink pens from a second 
stand. &quot;I&#39;ve got to run, Lisa doesn&#39;t like to wait.&quot; Gently, he grinned 
over his shoulder. &quot;Thanks again, Kirika. I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; With a 
wave, he headed off to the front counter. Kirika watched covertly as he 
paid for his art supplies, then headed outside, the bag hanging from his 
wrist. One arm went around the teenager with a happy hug, the blonde 
girl&#39;s irritation fading into a wry smile that reminded Kirika of 
Mirelle&#39;s sarcasm. The two wandered off down the street side by side, 
and Kirika found herself watching until both were out of sight.

With a sigh of her own, she glanced at the display herself. Maybe she&#39;d 
try a few of them. At least it was something to do with her time.

--------------------------------------------------------

Poor Kirika. Sorry if the ending is a little rushed - after Alexander 
left, there wasn&#39;t really much more for her to do. Next chapter: Mirelle 
comes home, Breffort reappears, erotic dreams, and PIE! Frightening, ne?</pre>
