<h1>Black Turned Red</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is my first time writing a short fic, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be 
any good at it or not. I prefer writing a story with a long plot and 
dragging things out (agonisingly) slowly. But, since this is a fanfic 
for the Yuricon fan fiction contest, I had to limit its size.

This fanfic is a Mireille/Kirika one from the anime series Noir. Sorry, 
but no action here. It&#39;s romantic fluff all the way (for the most part). 
It takes place a short time after the conclusion of the series, so there 
are some spoilers. Additionally, several themes of this fic will be 
shared in my other upcoming Noir fanfic. Think of this one as a brief 
taste of what&#39;s to come (except with a lot of action accompanying it 
^_^).

Now on with the fic...

** This story can now be found and reviewed on Mediaminer.org.

** This fanfic won &#39;Favourite Drama&#39; at the 2003 Yuricon Fan Fiction 
contest! Wai! ^_^

- Kirika

******

Mireille Bouquet&#39;s eyes slowly fluttered open, and a slightly blurred 
view of the apartment&#39;s ceiling greeted her. The woman blinked her 
bleary blue eyes groggily for a few moments, clearing her vision. She 
then took a deep breath, before releasing it softly, the act barely 
audible. A satin-smooth, solid, and yet at the same time supple mass was 
pressed against her side, radiating a comforting warmth that spread over 
her naked body under the bed covers. Mireille exhaled peacefully once 
more, used to the presence next to her. She had been now for a 
considerable amount of time even before everything had... changed. 
Sleeping in the same, somewhat larger than normal, single bed had 
previously been out of necessity for them both--simply a woman and a 
girl sharing the only bed in the apartment. But now the reasons behind 
it were quite different. Mireille&#39;s *life* was different now, but she 
couldn&#39;t even think of ever going back to the way things had been.

Mireille drew her arm a little tighter around the presence, holding it 
closer to her body. She heard a quiet intake of breath at the action. A 
faint smile tugged at the corners of Mireille&#39;s lips. So she was awake. 
Mireille wasn&#39;t surprised. It was nearly always the same every morning.

Mireille turned her head on the pillow to Kirika, meeting the girl&#39;s 
while not quite intense, but rather intent, or even rapt, brown gaze. 
Kirika&#39;s eyes were so expressive, soulful, and spoke volumes... at least 
to Mireille. The quiet girl often gazed at her partner in that way, 
simply looking, but at the same time conveying something much more. It 
had disturbed Mireille to some extent at first to be looked upon so 
intently, as if she wholly enthralled Kirika. But of course, now, she 
was completely comfortable with it. Indeed, she expected and, she had to 
admit, craved it. It was just one of many things Kirika did that so 
enamoured Mireille, one of many idiosyncrasies she possessed that the 
woman now couldn&#39;t imagine living without.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Mireille said quietly, her smile now taking hold over 
her features, growing somewhat.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Kirika replied in her soft voice, continuing to gaze at 
Mireille, except now into her eyes.

They spoke in Japanese, as they always did when they were alone 
together--which was virtually most of the time. And in a city where the 
French language predominantly reigned, it granted Mireille and Kirika a 
sense of privacy even when in a crowd of people; their own little world 
where only the two of them existed. It was strange... Mireille had 
always communicated with Kirika in Japanese--at least when in 
private--only speaking French or another language when it was necessary 
ever since they had first met. Perhaps it was because she had first 
encountered Kirika in Japan, or because of the fact that the girl was 
Japanese. Whatever the reason, Mireille knew that initially it hadn&#39;t 
been to make Kirika more at ease in a foreign country. Mireille&#39;s 
feelings for her had been considerably different back then.

Mireille moved her left hand from Kirika&#39;s bare shoulder to the nape of 
her partner&#39;s neck, and idly began playing with her sleep-tousled dark 
locks, twisting them gently around her fingers. &quot;Sleep well?&quot; she said 
rather teasingly as her expression turned wry, a fine and suggestive 
blonde eyebrow rising.

Kirika made a small sound in the affirmative and nodded her head, not 
catching the insinuation behind Mireille&#39;s words.

Mireille smirked a little. She didn&#39;t believe the girl could have 
forgotten what the two of them had been occupied with throughout most of 
last night; Kirika was just still so na&iuml;ve in many ways. While Kirika 
possessed combat abilities far beyond that of countless people older 
than she, in essence she was still a child. She still retained some of 
her innocence, despite the life she had led thus far. And a part of 
Mireille was thankful for that.

Deciding not to push the subject of the previous night&#39;s passionate 
events, Mireille instead shifted forwards a little and deposited a light 
peck on Kirika&#39;s lips. &quot;You can stay in bed if you want,&quot; she said as 
Kirika opened her eyes again, having closed them during the brief kiss, 
&quot;I can handle breakfast today.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika mumbled in the negative, shaking her head a tad. &quot;It&#39;s 
okay. I can help.&quot;

Mireille smiled. Kirika always tried to be helpful to her... and the 
darkhaired girl rarely took no for an answer. &quot;Alright, you can make the 
tea then,&quot; Mireille conceded, eliciting a dutiful nod and a small, 
pleased smile from Kirika.

Mireille extracted her arm from under Kirika and sat up in the bed, 
letting the sheets fall heedlessly from her naked body. After a politely 
suppressed yawn, she got out of bed and stretched with a quiet moan, 
reaching high for the ceiling as she got the kinks out of her aching 
muscles. Mireille then walked over to the nearby blue coach where her 
dressing gown resided and picked up the white silk garment, slipping it 
on. The woman turned back to the bed with a knowing half-smile on her 
face, having been acutely aware of Kirika&#39;s eyes on her as soon as she 
had left the bed. And sure enough, as Mireille turned, the girl&#39;s gaze 
met hers.

&quot;Do you see something you like?&quot; Mireille purred coyly, noticing 
Kirika&#39;s eyes flick to the opening in her dressing gown for an instant, 
before returning to her eyes. The blonde took her time in drawing her 
robe closed and tying it; she had known her partner wouldn&#39;t have been 
able to resist looking.

Kirika quickly averted her eyes from the sight of the beautiful woman&#39;s 
partially exposed form and rolled onto her back in the bed, saying 
nothing. Mireille simply smiled and put on her slippers. She was rather 
fond of teasing Kirika. While the girl didn&#39;t really show it by blushing 
and such, she did sometimes get a little shy when it came to the 
physical aspects of their relationship. Not as much as a girl her age 
normally would, but Mireille could see the signs of embarrassment, even 
if they were subtle. And she delighted in bringing them out.

Mireille flicked her mane of blonde hair out from under the back of her 
dressing gown, and then walked down the few steps that led from the 
bedroom to the living room. Her eyes were unconsciously attracted to the 
pot plant sitting on a small square table by a window, near to the 
billiard table. After the old one had been destroyed in a shoot out, 
Mireille had bought a new orchid. Unlike the last one however, this one 
possessed a number of pale pink flowers laced in between its long and 
wide green leaves. Mireille and Kirika had shared in caring for the 
plant as soon as it had been purchased shortly after they had returned 
to Paris, taking turns watering it, as they had done so in the past. 
Over time, the orchid&#39;s buds had blossomed and then flourished, with 
more and more pink flowers blooming everyday. It always made Mireille 
feel happy when she looked upon the thriving plant. It was a symbol of 
her relationship with Kirika, and continuously reminded the woman of all 
they had been through together. It hadn&#39;t been easy getting to this 
blissful, peaceful point.

Mireille smiled nostalgically, remembering how it had been previously 
between herself and Kirika. She had been so cold to Kirika when they had 
first met, seeing the girl as merely a means to an end more than a 
friend, or even an actual colleague. But as time went by.... It was as 
if Kirika had somehow, almost unnoticeably, sneaked her way into 
Mireille&#39;s hard heart, warming it and melting the ice that had 
surrounded it. Mireille had eventually realised what was happening, and 
had tried her utmost to resist the changes between them. But her efforts 
had ultimately been futile, and token. By that time Kirika had already 
claimed Mireille&#39;s heart utterly. Nevertheless, Mireille had kept up the 
denial of her feelings after her realisation, swearing to herself that 
when Kirika was no longer needed, she would keep her promise to kill the 
girl.

Mireille shook her head ruefully. What foolishness. Kill Kirika? It had 
been far to late to do that and consequently fulfil her pledge. When it 
had finally came to the time when Mireille was expected to kill her, the 
assassin had hesitated and then faltered outright, instead granting 
Kirika a supposed stay of execution. Another self-delusion. And when 
Kirika had left... at first Mireille had been glad, pleased that her 
life could go back to the way it had been, back to normal. But without 
Kirika, a void, an emptiness, had been left behind inside Mireille; one 
she hadn&#39;t liked to admit existed. But it had been there.

And of course, there was Kirika&#39;s letter, the letter that had confessed 
all of the introverted girl&#39;s feelings to Mireille. And that had been 
enough to shatter most of Mireille&#39;s waning resistance to what she felt. 
She still had that letter, but she would never tell Kirika that she did. 
Although she suspected her partner knew.

However, Mireille had always been quite a stubborn woman, and not until 
the very end, not until Kirika was about to leave her again for the 
last, absolute time, had she finally faced her feelings. It had taken 
Kirika&#39;s near death to at last push Mireille past her self-denial, and 
for her to confront what she felt for the girl. To confront that she in 
fact shared Kirika&#39;s feelings, and that she actually....

After returning to Paris, things had progressed slowly between Mireille 
and Kirika. Mireille had always worked alone, but now to have a 
partner... and one for life... It had been a big step for her. Kirika 
had always been a little more open with her feelings than Mireille, and 
like before, she had let the woman take control of their changing 
relationship, being patient and giving her time to adjust. As a result, 
their love for one another had grown gradually, like the plant they 
nurtured together. Firstly, they had talked more, and with greater 
intimacy, especially on Mireille&#39;s part. Soon there were meaningful 
looks and casual touches; mere brushes of hands and the like. However, 
those fleeting touches soon turned to caresses, then close, fond 
embraces, and then finally Mireille had gotten the nerve one night to 
kiss Kirika for the first time, and at last tell her outright how she 
felt about her. It had been somewhat difficult for Mireille to admit 
that she indeed loved Kirika; it had been the first time she had ever 
told anyone she loved them, romantically at least. She had had other 
lovers, but those relationships had been purely physical, nothing more. 
Regardless, with that final barrier gone, their love for one another 
continued to bloom even more brightly, like the beautiful flowers on the 
orchid had, growing and flourishing as time went by.

Mireille looked over to where her yellow scooter was parked, resting up 
against the radiator. It hadn&#39;t been used for months now. It was made 
for only one person to ride, after all, so she didn&#39;t have much use for 
it anymore. She was no longer alone. There was a tale, wasn&#39;t there? A 
tale that said a red thread joined two eternal lovers together by their 
pinkie fingers. When exactly had the thread tied between herself and 
Kirika turned red? Mireille had believed--or at least had wanted--that 
thread between them to be black, a shade darker than darkness itself. 
But somewhere along the line, that thread&#39;s colour had flaked away, 
instead revealing a deep red beneath. A part of Mireille had feared the 
loss of her independence--the part of her that had been so resistant to 
how she felt about Kirika--but another part of her had welcomed it. She 
was in love. Mireille and Kirika were a couple now, a family even; 
something the woman hadn&#39;t experienced in a long time, if ever. One 
would think that it would be impossible for someone to fall in love with 
their own family&#39;s murderer; they would expect Mireille&#39;s parents and 
brother to be turning in their graves at this very moment. But Mireille 
didn&#39;t see Kirika as the person who had killed her family. It hadn&#39;t 
been the girl&#39;s fault. She had been so young at the time... and easy to 
control, which Altena had taken full advantage of. If Mireille blamed 
anyone for her family&#39;s murder it was Altena and her Soldats enclave. 
Altena had only used Kirika as the tool to preform the nefarious act. 
Kirika had been the weapon, and Altena had been the wielder of that 
weapon. And did one blame the weapon or the user of that weapon for an 
ensuing misdeed? Kirika had been a victim, as Mireille saw it, and she 
believed that her parents and brother would have seen it the same way 
also. Her family could rest easy--their murderer had already paid for 
her crime.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; a soft voice spoke from behind Mireille, caressing each 
syllable of the woman&#39;s name in a special way no one else could.

Mireille came out of her reverie and turned to Kirika who was standing 
by the half-a-dozen or so steps leading to the bedroom, now dressed in 
the spaghetti top and shorts she normally slept in. Kirika looked at her 
curiously, and the blonde brought a hand to her head, smiling faintly.

&quot;I was just daydreaming,&quot; Mireille confessed, rubbing one of her temples 
for emphasis.

Kirika&#39;s inquisitive expression vanished, replaced by a rather knowing 
one. She walked up to Mireille and embraced her without preamble, 
wrapping her arms around the taller woman&#39;s slender waist. Mireille 
looked down at the girl, bemused, as Kirika looked back up at her.

&quot;You do that a lot,&quot; Kirika said, her eyes shifting to something behind 
Mireille for an instant.

&quot;Do I?&quot; Mireille replied with feigned surprise in her voice. She should 
have known Kirika would notice. Kirika always noticed just about 
everything when it had to do with her. While the darkhaired girl was 
still as subdued and as quiet as ever, despite the changes in her 
relationship with her partner, she could be quite perceptive. Mireille 
had no doubt that Kirika knew exactly what she had been reminiscing 
about a couple of minutes ago.

Kirika continued to hug Mireille for a few moments, saying nothing in 
response. She didn&#39;t have to. Mireille returned the hug, squeezing 
Kirika in her arms briefly before reaching up and stroking her fingers 
through the girl&#39;s short hair.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go and get the tea started? I&#39;ll be through to help with 
breakfast in a minute,&quot; Mireille said, placing her hands on Kirika&#39;s 
slight shoulders.

Kirika nodded enthusiastically and smiled, making a small, cute sound of 
approval Mireille knew well. She then let go of the blonde woman and 
scurried off into the kitchen, out of sight. Mireille watched her go. 
Kirika smiled a lot more often nowadays.

&quot;Kirika, why don&#39;t you use the new blend we got the other day?&quot; Mireille 
then called to the unseen girl as an afterthought.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Kirika called back.

As she heard the clatter of what was most likely a kettle being put on 
the stove, Mireille went over to the billiard table where her computer 
resided. She switched on the machine and sat in the chair next to the 
makeshift desk, the sounds of a brewing kettle mixed with tableware 
being prepared coming out from the kitchen. Kirika must be starting 
breakfast by herself also.

&quot;I could have done it,&quot; Mireille mumbled idly to herself, although she 
wasn&#39;t the least bit annoyed. She might have guessed that Kirika&#39;s 
assistance would lead to the girl ending up doing the majority, if not 
all, of the food preparation herself. It regularly happened. Kirika 
simply liked to aid Mireille in any way that she could. Mireille found 
it quite endearing.

As soon as the computer&#39;s operating system had booted up, Mireille 
logged onto the Internet to check her email, all the while circumspectly 
glancing over the monitor to the kitchen to make sure Kirika was still 
occupied with making breakfast. As the assassin had suspected, her 
secure email account&#39;s inbox had several potential assignment proposals 
waiting for her--or rather &#39;Noir&#39;. Like she had done all the other times 
in the past after returning to Paris from Spain&#39;s border, Mireille 
deleted every single one of the emails. She wasn&#39;t ready to go back to 
that life yet. No, not yet. And she believed Kirika wasn&#39;t either. 
Mireille hadn&#39;t told Kirika about all of the assignments they had been 
regularly offered, preferring to hide the knowledge from the girl. 
Mireille didn&#39;t want that other life interfering with her and Kirika&#39;s 
content, peaceful world. It was always a dark shadow looming over them 
however; one Mireille tried her best to forget about but never quite 
could. The woman still even carried her Walther P99 with her whenever 
she left the apartment--she could never know when an old memory with a 
grudge to settle might track her down. A person in her line of work had 
to forever be vigilant. However, Mireille didn&#39;t want to expose Kirika 
to the violence that had been so predominant in her life before. Right 
now Kirika was happy, almost like she was a normal child with no skills 
at all in the art of murder. She even carried no firearm when going 
outside, having not replaced her previously lost one... although 
arguably, Kirika was a weapon in herself. But Mireille knew that another 
person lurked beneath the quiet, fairly shy girl she knew and loved... a 
darker, more unfeeling girl. And she didn&#39;t want that heartless persona 
of Kirika to ever emerge again, if she could help it. There would come a 
day, however--a day that Mireille dreaded--when she would have to place 
a gun in Kirika&#39;s hands once again. It was inevitable. The lives they 
led were filled with blood and death, and there was no true escape. 
Except to die themselves. But Mireille would delay that feared day for 
as long as she could and do her utmost to preserve her and Kirika&#39;s 
blissful way of life. And in the meantime, she would cherish each 
pleasurable day as if it were the last, because perhaps, one day, it 
would be.

******

Mireille was on her computer keeping up to date with the latest news 
from around the world via the Internet when she heard Kirika leave the 
bathroom. She then heard the wardrobe door slide open as the darkhaired 
girl began to get dressed. Mireille disconnected from the Internet and 
shutdown the computer. She was tempted to peek over the black wall that 
separated the bedroom from the living room and spy on Kirika, 
subsequently drawing out a reaction from her--although the blonde 
wouldn&#39;t mind the show of the girl getting changed either--but in all 
honesty her partner probably wouldn&#39;t react much at all.

Mireille sighed and leaned back in her chair, placing her hands behind 
her head, and listened to the rustle of clothes in the next room. 
Mireille had already showered and dressed before Kirika earlier, while 
the quiet girl had been busy clearing away and washing the breakfast 
dishes she had insisted on doing. Mireille felt a little bit guilty 
about that. She had frequently let Kirika do most of the menial, 
everyday tasks before the nature of their relationship had changed, such 
as letting her carry shopping bags and luggage. Even now, with their 
circumstances very different, Mireille still slipped into her 
domineering role and allowed Kirika to do most of the chores around the 
apartment. In the past the woman had viewed Kirika as a sort of little 
&#39;servant&#39; as it were, someone to do all the jobs she herself didn&#39;t like 
doing. She had tried to change now that they were involved in a romantic 
relationship, but it wasn&#39;t easy. Although, Mireille thought 
defensively, she did usually help out with the cooking. Of course, that 
was the one task she hadn&#39;t been completely adverse to back then... and 
still wasn&#39;t.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika&#39;s voice said from a short distance in front of the 
blonde.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Mireille said absently, sitting upright in her chair to look at 
her partner. She then immediately smiled affectionately and leaned 
forward, placing her elbows on the billiard table and lacing her fingers 
together, before resting her head on top of her hands. &quot;My, aren&#39;t we 
cute today?&quot; she commented admiringly, taking in the outfit Kirika had 
chosen to wear.

Kirika was dressed in a red and white horizontally striped v-neck 
t-shirt and a short, light brown skirt that came down to just above her 
knees. Mireille recalled buying the clothes for her a while back. A 
couple of weeks after they had returned to Paris, Mireille had splurged 
on Kirika and bought her a whole new wardrobe, replacing some of the 
clothes her partner had lost on her long journey to the Manor, and also 
purchasing new ones. Mireille had more or less picked them out herself 
with only a minimum of input from Kirika, but the girl had seemed to 
like her choices... and had also graciously let the blonde play dress-up 
with her as the model.

Kirika lowered her head to the floor bashfully at the flattering remark, 
but with an obviously pleased smile on her face. &quot;Mireille,&quot; she then 
said, &quot;you said I could paint you today.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Mireille said, faking surprise. &quot;Did I?&quot; She smirked and then 
stood up from her chair, sighing in mock resignation. She ran the 
fingertips of one hand along her bare midriff rather alluringly, just 
below her red sleeveless top. &quot;Anything for me to take my clothes off, 
hmm?&quot; Mireille made a disapproving &#39;tsk&#39; sound in the back of her 
throat. &quot;But if it&#39;s in the name of art...&quot; Her hands moved down to the 
top button of the low, stylish, hip-hugging blue shorts she was wearing, 
as if she was about to unbutton and remove them.

Kirika looked up and blinked before shaking her head quite frantically 
in denial. &quot;No,&quot; she exclaimed in her soft voice, her expression one of 
mild shock. &quot;You don&#39;t have to take your clothes off.&quot;

&quot;Aw, that&#39;s too bad,&quot; Mireille said with disappointment in her tone, 
placing her hands on her hips while she schooled her expression to one 
of regret. &quot;Perhaps next time...&quot;

&quot;I would like to paint you outside in the park,&quot; Kirika explained, 
ignoring her older partner&#39;s teasing. She glanced out a window to the 
sunny outdoors. &quot;It&#39;s a nice day...&quot;

Mireille&#39;s eyes shifted to the numerous paintings that adorned the black 
wall that separated the room from the adjacent bedroom. While several of 
them were of landscapes, the majority were of Mireille herself in 
various poses. In most of those portraits she appeared reasonably 
content, and yet at the same time, melancholy. Mireille didn&#39;t dwell on 
it.

Mireille had encouraged Kirika to take up a hobby not long after they 
had come back to Paris. Kirika had been robbed of most of her childhood; 
her no doubt extensive training in assassination having left little room 
for the activities that filled the days of a normal girl. And Mireille 
had felt sad because of that. The woman had even considered enrolling 
Kirika in school once again, since it was clear her partner&#39;s education 
on commonplace topics was noticeably lacking, but after careful 
deliberation she had decided against it. While Mireille had been sure 
she could have had an identity constructed for Kirika that would have 
provided relative safety from the girl&#39;s shady profession, the 
disadvantages of her returning to school had outweighed the benefits. 
Kirika would have probably wanted to return to Japan and finish her 
education over there, meaning Mireille would have to leave France with 
her. And not to mention Mireille would have been very lonely during 
schooldays left all by herself. Besides, the woman herself could teach 
Kirika the things she needed to know when it was required. And with 
those flimsy reasons in mind, Mireille had settled on keeping her 
partner out of school.

So as an alternative, Mireille had persuaded Kirika to take up her 
painting again. The blonde had been somewhat wary to do so at first, 
what with the bad memories that were associated with the hobby for 
Kirika, but in the end the introverted girl had complied with her 
wishes. It had been slow going in the beginning--Kirika having not been 
very enthusiastic about it, most likely haunted by the past--but as soon 
as Mireille had suggested that she paint her, she had warmed to the 
pastime. Kirika had become quite the little artist, and Mireille was 
glad for it. It made Kirika seem happier, as if she didn&#39;t have a soiled 
history behind her and was simply a quiet, ordinary girl instead.

Mireille turned her head to look out the window at the bright sunny sky. 
She smiled and looked back at Kirika. &quot;Yes, it is. Alright, let&#39;s go to 
the park then, shall we?&quot; she said, her smile broadening at Kirika&#39;s now 
even more delighted countenance. &quot;But why don&#39;t we make a day of it; how 
does a picnic sound?&quot;

Kirika nodded eagerly and made a happy sound of endorsement while 
keeping her eyes on Mireille. Mireille could practically see the love 
and adoration shining in those brown orbs. The woman felt her heart melt 
just a little bit more. It was hard to believe she had been so cold and 
callous to the adorable girl before.

Mireille walked around the billiard table to Kirika and draped one arm 
around her shoulders, while bending down to her. &quot;Then why don&#39;t you go 
and fetch your art supplies and I&#39;ll get the picnic food started,&quot; she 
suggested with a playful wink. At Kirika&#39;s keen sound of agreement, 
Mireille grinned and kissed her tenderly on the cheek. &quot;Good.&quot;

Mireille let Kirika leave her embrace, and with a pat on the bottom 
urging her into motion, the girl dashed off to gather her painting 
equipment. Mireille smiled indulgently as Kirika scampered to a 
windowsill where most of her supplies resided and began to pick out what 
she would bring along with her. It seemed like today would be like all 
the others before them so far after returning home to Paris. Another day 
filled with pleasure and peace. Mireille wasn&#39;t complaining. Indeed, she 
was thankful.

&quot;Mireille, the picnic,&quot; Kirika reminded her partner, her voice startling 
Mireille out of her musings.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Mireille said with slightly strained levity. &quot;I just have 
to... do something first.&quot;

Mireille walked into the bedroom and picked up her handbag that was 
lying on the couch. After a discreet and rather anxious look back to 
Kirika to make sure that the girl was thoroughly engaged with selecting 
her painting utensils, she moved over to the now made bed and crouched 
down beside it. She reached underneath it and searched along the 
mattress supports until she felt the cool sensation of metal on her 
skin. With another apprehensive glance in Kirika&#39;s direction over her 
shoulder, Mireille pulled out her gun from under the bed. She dropped 
her purse on the bed while she checked the ammunition in the weapon as 
silently as she could, ejecting the clip it was loaded with. The 
magazine contained the maximum amount of 9mm Parabellum rounds it could 
carry, with an additional round in the actual chamber of the firearm. 
Good. Mireille slid the clip back into the gun and then placed the 
weapon securely in her handbag.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika&#39;s voice called from the other room.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m coming,&quot; Mireille called back. She replaced her purse on the 
couch, where she would soon retrieve it when she headed out with Kirika, 
and then proceeded for the kitchen.

******

Mireille dozed with half-lidded blue eyes on her back in the park 
located not far from the apartment. She was lying on a grassy slope with 
her legs crossed and her hands behind her head, her long blonde tresses 
fanning out around her. The bright sun bathed her in its warmth from 
above, lulling her senses. Kirika was naturally beside her, sitting with 
her artbook resting against her knees and with a brush in hand, while 
the rest of her painting equipment was next to her. The remains of the 
picnic were by her feet in a wicker basket, the majority of the food 
having been already eaten for lunch earlier. Mireille&#39;s handbag with its 
dangerous but prudent contents was by the woman&#39;s other side, away from 
Kirika.

Mireille reached down to adjust one of her black thigh-high stockings on 
one leg and then replaced her hands behind her head. She spared a glance 
at her companion. Kirika was busy painting away and had been doing so 
ever since they had finished eating. She occasionally studied Mireille 
for a moment or two with critical eyes, and then went back to painting 
again. Mireille could tell that the girl was concentrating, although she 
doubted anybody else would be able to recognise it. Kirika&#39;s features 
remained as relaxed as ever, and she painted with lazy, leisurely 
strokes of her brush. But Mireille knew by her partner&#39;s lovely eyes 
that she was focused on her task. The woman often used Kirika&#39;s eyes to 
gauge how the quiet girl was feeling.

Mireille tried to meet Kirika&#39;s eyes as the amateur artist scrutinised 
some particular part of her body, but without avail. Kirika was studying 
Mireille so keenly that she didn&#39;t appear to notice the woman&#39;s efforts. 
Mireille often wondered what Kirika saw when she looked at her so 
intently. She knew that the girl looked up to her a little. Did Kirika 
see a mentor then as well as merely a &#39;business&#39; partner? Or an older 
sister perhaps--Mireille was the only family Kirika had; indeed, the 
girl was the only family the blonde woman herself really had also. Or 
maybe she saw a friend, her best friend? Or did Kirika see only her 
lover, the person she had given her heart to? Mireille didn&#39;t know, but 
she believed that perhaps Kirika saw all five. She was the only person 
in the darkhaired girl&#39;s life, after all, the only person she even 
knew... who hadn&#39;t been killed. And, in truth, Kirika was the only 
person that truly mattered in Mireille&#39;s life as well. The woman did 
have friends, but most could more accurately be called contacts instead. 
They were only really interested in her money.

Mireille had initially had her misgivings about being looked upon by 
Kirika as if she was everything important in the world, and still did to 
a degree. The sense of responsibility made her a little uncomfortable. 
She feared that if she ever made some sort of mistake in her behaviour 
or inadvertently did something to harm Kirika that the girl&#39;s image of 
her would be shattered. However, to be viewed as someone so utterly... 
*vital* to another person, did have some benefits also. It filled 
Mireille with self-confidence that Kirika saw her in that way, and, she 
grudgingly admitted, a smidgen of pride as well. It made her feel 
special. And, that despite all the sins she had committed in her life, 
someone still saw a person worthy to be admired and... loved. That 
particular feeling warmed and comforted Mireille&#39;s heart.

The blonde let out a little puff of air as Kirika returned her attention 
to her artbook. Or perhaps Kirika simply saw Mireille as a model for her 
artwork. Mireille smiled at the notion and gave a small chuckle, causing 
her companion&#39;s now questioning gaze to return to her, this time to her 
eyes.

Mireille shook her head where it rested on her hands. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; 
she said, dismissing the laugh. After staring at the woman for a few 
seconds, Kirika went back to painting.

Mireille felt her eyelids grow even heavier as time passed, the songs of 
birds in the trees around her and the hum of other people&#39;s 
conversations in the park causing her mind to wander aimlessly. Now more 
acutely aware of the pleasant heat from the sun enveloping her body, 
Mireille&#39;s eyes closed completely, the blonde woman feeling drowsy. 
Well, she hadn&#39;t had that much sleep last night, after all. The stray 
thought caused a faint smile to form on her features.

Mireille was gently awakened by a tender voice calling her name, and by 
something warm stroking her lightly across her bare stomach. Her eyes 
opened slowly and she was greeted by Kirika&#39;s cute face only a short 
distance above her own, the girl&#39;s dark locks hanging a mere few inches 
from touching her cheeks.

&quot;You know,&quot; Mireille said softly, &quot;you&#39;re supposed to wake me up with a 
kiss. Like in Sleeping Beauty.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Sleeping Beauty&#39;?&quot; Kirika echoed inquiringly, halting her caress of 
the woman&#39;s midriff with her fingertips.

&quot;It&#39;s a story about a prince who wakes a princess--who had been sleeping 
for a long time--with a kiss,&quot; Mireille explained patiently. &quot;So it 
makes it rather traditional that someone should wake their sleeping 
lover with a kiss. See?&quot;

Kirika nodded in understanding and then, to Mireille&#39;s mild surprise, 
she leaned down further and captured the beautiful woman&#39;s lips with her 
own, initiating a deep and loving kiss. After a considerable while, 
Kirika broke the lingering kiss and looked at Mireille expectantly.

&quot;Like that?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes... like that...&quot; Mireille answered rather breathlessly, licking her 
lips and tasting the residual flavour of her lover. &quot;Although I should 
be asleep when you do it. Not that I minded...&quot;

&quot;I will remember for next time,&quot; Kirika assured the blonde.

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re always so studious,&quot; Mireille commented as she sat up with a 
smile, the prospect of always being awakened every morning with a kiss 
from Kirika a pleasing thought. &quot;Is your painting finished?&quot; she then 
asked.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika said, nodding. She turned away from Mireille to pick up 
her artbook next to her and then presented the final portrait excitedly 
to the woman, her expression one of expectancy mixed with mild 
apprehension.

The painting was one of Mireille, as expected, with the woman lying in a 
relaxed position on a grass-covered slope. A backdrop of trees and an 
almost cloudless blue sky was behind her, creating a peaceful ambiance. 
The colours blended into each other well with Kirika&#39;s style of 
painting, the darkhaired girl having forgone sketching beforehand. It 
was a good picture in Mireille&#39;s opinion, one she would be pleased to 
add to the growing collection of portraits of herself on the wall back 
home.

&quot;It&#39;s very impressive,&quot; Mireille praised her budding young artist as she 
continued to admire the picture. &quot;You&#39;ve improved considerably since the 
last time you painted me.&quot; She looked at Kirika and smiled 
encouragingly. &quot;I like it.&quot;

Kirika practically beamed at Mireille&#39;s remarks, appearing very 
thrilled. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said shyly while gazing devotedly at the 
blonde woman.

Mireille put down the artbook in her lap and ruffled Kirika&#39;s hair 
affectionately with one hand, making the girl&#39;s exultant grin widen, if 
that were possible. Whenever Mireille complimented her for some artistic 
endeavour or another justified reason, Kirika was always incredibly 
overjoyed. It was as if only the woman&#39;s opinion was relevant, that no 
one else&#39;s mattered in the slightest. And while thus far all of 
Mireille&#39;s prior accolades had been genuine, in truth she would probably 
always commend her partner when the girl sought it. She had a distinct 
feeling that any harsh or insensitive words on her part would be a 
significant blow to Kirika&#39;s psyche.

&quot;Hey, do you feel like going out for dinner tonight?&quot; Mireille asked on 
the spur of the moment. &quot;You could wear that new dress I got you....&quot; 
she added enticingly, more for her own benefit than for Kirika&#39;s. She 
had been dying to see the cute girl in it.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Kirika promptly agreed.

Mireille placed a hand behind her partner&#39;s head and bent forwards, 
before planting a kiss on her forehead in gratitude. Meanwhile, the 
woman&#39;s other hand touched something beside her, something made of 
leather but with a hard, solid object beneath it. Her handbag. 
Mireille&#39;s expression fell a little, causing Kirika to look at her 
inquiringly. But the blonde quickly smiled reassuringly at the quiet 
girl, who then smiled prettily back, apparently placated. The world was 
still peaceful.

******

&quot;Mm, that was good wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Mireille remarked to Kirika beside her, 
fairly satisfied with their recent dining experience. &quot;The lobster was 
just fantastic!&quot;

The pair were walking down the street, heading back for their apartment 
a short distance away. The restaurant they frequented often was not too 
far from their home, and Mireille and Kirika normally simply used their 
legs to get there, rather than taking a taxi. It was late now, night 
having already fallen by the time they had finished dinner. The old 
cobbled streets were suffused in a pale amber glow from the black iron 
streetlights, causing ominous shadows to streak out from every murky 
alleyway Mireille and Kirika passed by, as if threatening to pull them 
into their dark embrace. The sky above was clear, but the moon was 
small, barely shining down its pallid light on the world below.

&quot;I liked the tortes,&quot; Kirika said. &quot;The strawberry one.&quot;

Mireille bobbed her head in ready agreement. &quot;Yes, they were good too!&quot; 
she concurred.

Mireille looked to her left, where her partner was walking next to her. 
Kirika had worn the dress Mireille had suggested she should wear, and 
the woman thought she looked simply divine in it. She suited royal blue. 
Mireille would have to buy more clothing of that particular colour for 
her.

Mireille looked away from Kirika as the dead weight in her left hand 
made itself known once again. She carried her handbag closely by her 
side, a heavy and constant burden. And reminder. Peace was fleeting; 
bliss didn&#39;t last forever. The assassin&#39;s features became serious, 
grave, as the hushed sound of footsteps that mirrored her and Kirika&#39;s 
own returned to her ears. The man a handful of metres behind Mireille 
and Kirika had been following them ever since they had left the 
restaurant. Mireille had only gotten a brief look at the tail, but it 
had been enough to disturb her. The man was nondescript, someone you 
wouldn&#39;t think twice about in a crowd. Someone you wouldn&#39;t normally 
notice, or rather, pay any attention to. He was simply ordinary. It had 
put Mireille&#39;s instincts on full alert.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; Kirika inquired, looking peculiarly at the blonde woman, no 
doubt noticing the change in her expression and the general air about 
her.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mireille said, turning her head to Kirika. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; she 
then assured the darkhaired girl at the sight of her slightly concerned 
countenance, faking a content smile as well as brightness in her tone of 
voice.

Kirika nodded, not appearing entirely convinced.

They were nearly home now with the side street that led to their 
apartment building now in view, only a dozen or so metres away. Mireille 
quickened her stride a little at the welcome sight of their safe haven, 
Kirika following suit to keep up. The footsteps behind them increased 
their pace also. Mireille swallowed somewhat uneasily. He would strike 
soon; she knew it. The best place and time would be when Mireille and 
Kirika turned down the lane where their apartment building was. It would 
be any second now. But Mireille would be faster. She had been ready for 
this moment for so long, from almost ever since coming back to Paris.

All of sudden the man&#39;s gait accelerated, and he broke into a hurried 
trot. Then, a fraction of a second later, a full out run. Mireille was 
caught off guard and her heartbeat immediately escalated. He wasn&#39;t 
waiting for the street turning! The Corsican assassin abruptly stopped 
walking and thrust her free hand into her handbag with lightning 
alacrity, half-turning to face her rapidly approaching adversary and 
beginning to draw out her gun as she did so. Her face was a picture of 
determination as she moved, about to defend her and Kirika&#39;s peaceful 
world. But... no. After this, it would no longer be peaceful.

However, the unknown man instead ran harmlessly past Mireille, leaving 
an astonished woman in his wake. She turned around to see him call out 
in French to a taxicab that was pulling away from the curb ahead to 
wait, waving wildly to attract the driver&#39;s attention. Mireille blinked 
as the taxi stopped and let the frantic but now also grateful man 
inside, before the vehicle drove off. Her heartbeat gradually calmed, 
and her breathing became more relaxed. It had been nothing after all. 
She had simply let her worries and imagination get to her.

Mireille slowly looked at Kirika and met her gaze. The girl appeared 
unruffled as usual, completely unperturbed. Her eyes shifted down to the 
pink and white striped purse the woman&#39;s right hand was still halfway 
inside. Mireille looked down, following Kirika&#39;s gaze. A dull greyish 
piece of metal could be seen peeking out from the bag, clutched in 
Mireille&#39;s hand. The handle of the gun was cold to the blonde&#39;s touch, 
almost freezing, and she felt as if the sensation reached all the way to 
the bones in her hand. She let it go, dropping it back into its dark, 
black confines.

Mireille looked up into Kirika&#39;s knowing eyes. She knew. But of course 
she knew; Kirika&#39;s senses and combat skills were superior to 
Mireille&#39;s--if the woman had known about the man behind them, then 
undoubtedly her partner had to have known about him as well. Mireille&#39;s 
abilities were second to Kirika&#39;s; the girl&#39;s were still as sharp as 
ever, in spite of her now tranquil way of life. The blonde shouldn&#39;t 
have forgotten that. But it wasn&#39;t just the man who had been &#39;tailing&#39; 
them that Kirika had been aware of. Mireille had a suspicion she instead 
knew about *everything*.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Mireille said with forced enthusiasm. &quot;We&#39;re almost home.&quot; 
She started walking again, as if nothing at all had transpired. Perhaps 
if she ignored what had happened, it wouldn&#39;t affect their quiet, serene 
world. On the surface at least. But that would be enough for Mireille, 
and, she believed--or more accurately hoped--it would be enough for 
Kirika also.

After a moment&#39;s hesitation, Kirika wordlessly joined the woman.

******

Mireille, dressed in the loose-fitting shirt she sometimes wore to bed, 
looked on silently from the top of the bedroom steps at Kirika, who was 
standing in the dark and shadow-strewn living room of the apartment 
while resting her forearms against a windowsill. The darkhaired girl had 
changed out of her dress and was now in her nightwear, and was currently 
occupied with gazing out an open window, but at what, Mireille had no 
idea. It was an activity Kirika engaged in often, however. The blonde 
remembered that her partner had done it regularly when they had first 
lived together too. Apparently wholly absorbed by whatever she saw out 
the window, Kirika didn&#39;t stir as Mireille approached her from behind 
and enfolded her slim form in her arms.

Mireille rested the side of her head against Kirika&#39;s and closed her 
eyes, before taking a deep breath and inhaling the pleasant scent of the 
shorter girl&#39;s hair. Mireille&#39;s hands began to roam over Kirika&#39;s body, 
softly and chastely at first, but then with greater and greater 
intimacy. One hand slipped under Kirika&#39;s light blue top and caressed 
the hard, taut muscles beneath, tracing wandering patterns on the girl&#39;s 
skin. Mireille&#39;s fingers were then naturally drawn to Kirika&#39;s lower 
left side, where she knew a faint bullet scar resided. It was a 
testament and a reminder--if Mireille needed one--of how much her 
precious partner loved and cared about her. Mireille&#39;s fingers lingered 
on the mark under Kirika&#39;s top, circling it delicately, before moving on 
to other parts of the girl&#39;s lithe body.

Meanwhile, Mireille&#39;s other, previously stationary, right hand dipped 
down into the waistband of Kirika&#39;s shorts, halting when her fingertips 
were only just inside. She then bent her head down and started to lay 
soft kisses on her partner&#39;s neck, applying mild suction to each spot 
her lips touched. Mireille heard Kirika give a restrained gasp and 
smiled, before returning her mouth to its pleasurable ministrations.

Mireille trailed her left hand upwards along Kirika&#39;s stomach until she 
reached her small, but firm, breasts. She cupped and lifted one of the 
supple mounds carefully, it just filling her hand delightfully and no 
more. The woman then squeezed the breast gently, and heard Kirika&#39;s 
breathing become deliberately slow and controlled in response. 
Mireille&#39;s other hand then at last moved further downwards into Kirika&#39;s 
shorts, its descent ceasing only when she felt the girl&#39;s silky-smooth 
pubis. She began to massage the area with her fingers--only a fraction 
of an inch above Kirika&#39;s vulva--applying hard and steady pressure. 
Kirika whimpered and bent her knees slightly while pressing herself back 
into Mireille, as if she was starting to have trouble standing up. 
Mireille smiled quite deviously against the hollow of her short 
partner&#39;s neck and her blue eyes dropped down to where her hand 
disappeared into the girl&#39;s shorts, the rather obscene, rippling bulge 
in them making her smile become a little lecherous also. Kirika would 
soon definitely have difficultly standing up.

Sensing that Kirika was ready, Mireille ceased the motions of her right 
hand and moved a bit lower into the girl&#39;s shorts to make sure of the 
fact. She slipped her long and slender middle finger between the folds 
of Kirika&#39;s inner labia--being careful not to so much as brush a 
specific, sensitive, spot--and felt how slick they were. Oh yes, she was 
most certainly ready.

Mireille kept her finger just on the outskirts of Kirika&#39;s swollen 
labia, all the while continuing to knead one of the darkhaired girl&#39;s 
breasts--and being very careful to avoid the unbearably hard bud gracing 
it. Her finger nestled near the entrance to Kirika&#39;s vagina occasionally 
delved further into the warm cleft, playing with the abundantly growing 
sticky wetness there. Kirika threw back her head and shut her eyes 
tightly, and was unable to hold back the small moan that escaped her 
throat as a result of Mireille&#39;s agonising--and highly 
arousing--fondling... or rather, teasing.

Resisting the urge to sink her finger deeply into the inviting and 
deliciously wet opening it was dancing around, Mireille instead stopped 
her sensual caresses and brought her full lips to Kirika&#39;s delicate 
shell of an ear. &quot;Why don&#39;t you close that window and come to bed,&quot; she 
whispered in a sultry tone to the shorter girl, her voice barely 
audible, but knowing that her lover would hear and understand perfectly.

Kirika swallowed and then, after opening her eyes, straightened in 
Mireille&#39;s embrace and reached out to shut and lock the window. Mireille 
extracted her hands from under Kirika&#39;s top and from her shorts, 
allowing the girl to turn to face her. The blonde woman first took her 
time to pop the finger coated with her lover&#39;s juices into her mouth and 
seductively suck it clean--all the while staring into Kirika&#39;s brown 
eyes with her own smouldering blue ones--before taking her partner 
tenderly by the hand and leading her quietly to the unlit bedroom.

Mireille arranged herself in a sitting position on the bed first, before 
directing Kirika to join her with a small tug of the hand still holding 
one of the girl&#39;s own. The woman licked her lips in anticipation as 
Kirika obeyed her and gracefully climbed onto the bed, situating herself 
in a kneeling position between her parted and slightly bent legs. 
Reaching out to her lover with a hand, Mireille tenderly cupped one of 
Kirika&#39;s cheeks and softly stroked it with her thumb. Kirika closed her 
eyes and inclined her head into the blonde&#39;s hand, pressing against it, 
and then let out a little content sigh. Mireille&#39;s thumb strayed to the 
darkhaired girl&#39;s lips, outlining them in lingering, feather-light 
circles.

After several moments, Mireille&#39;s gentle caresses stopped and her hand 
moved behind Kirika&#39;s head, before drawing the girl to her. Kirika 
opened her eyes briefly but then closed them once again at the sight of 
the Mireille&#39;s nearing mouth, the woman&#39;s lips parting and connecting to 
hers in a soft and loving kiss. The kiss however soon grew more and more 
heated, until Mireille&#39;s tongue was duelling for supremacy inside 
Kirika&#39;s warm--and slowly becoming ravished--mouth.

Many minutes later, Mireille&#39;s lips left Kirika&#39;s and her eyes opened to 
meet her partner&#39;s, both lovers now panting somewhat, their breathing 
quick but hushed. Kirika stared into Mireille&#39;s eyes, wordlessly seeking 
a signal from the woman. Mireille simply stared silently back through 
the darkness of the bedroom, speaking with her blue gaze. After a couple 
of seconds Kirika blinked, and then looked down to the blonde&#39;s white 
shirt, before beginning to slowly unbutton it from the top.

Mireille watched Kirika&#39;s fingers as they deftly opened her shirt--the 
only article of clothing she was wearing--and revealed her full, 
luscious breasts to her partner&#39;s view. Kirika&#39;s amorous intentions were 
perfectly clear. Once, in the past, Mireille would have been very 
uncomfortable allowing the girl to do such a thing to her... and not to 
mention she herself doing what she had done to Kirika earlier. After it 
had dawned on her that eventually their blossoming romantic relationship 
would be taken to a more intimate, physical level, Mireille had been 
wrought with reservations. Kirika had lost much of her innocence 
already, and the woman hadn&#39;t been sure if it was right for her to take 
away what little remained of it. The girl was so young too--still high 
school aged compared to the blonde&#39;s own, more mature age--and if that 
hadn&#39;t been enough for Mireille to be concerned about, Kirika had been 
completely na&iuml;ve about sex also. Altena and her lackeys had evidently 
skipped over discussing the mechanics of intercourse and reproduction 
with her, like many facets of the girl&#39;s general education. And, 
thankfully, it hadn&#39;t appeared that Chloe had managed to get the chance 
to improve Kirika&#39;s lacking knowledge with &#39;hands on&#39; experience during 
the time they had spent together either--Mireille had been quite angry 
and considerably disappointed when she had learned that her departed 
knife-throwing rival had stolen her partner&#39;s first kiss from her... and 
still was. But then Mireille had never really liked Chloe... the 
deceased Soldats assassin&#39;s attempted murder of her notwithstanding.

With Kirika more or less clueless about sex, it had left Mireille with 
the dubious--while albeit rather arousing--honour of teaching her all 
about how to make love to another woman. After having taken into account 
the complicated situation she was faced with, Mireille had ultimately 
decided in favour of allowing herself and Kirika to express their love 
for one another physically, with no boundaries. She had reasoned that 
Kirika would no doubt eventually ascertain that something was missing 
from their relationship, and that in the end they would sleep together 
regardless. And, Mireille reluctantly admitted, she had furthermore long 
desired to make love to her cute partner, and hadn&#39;t been able to wait 
any longer. And if that made her a dirty, cradle-robbing old woman, then 
so be it. Besides, it wasn&#39;t like she was that much older than Kirika. 
At least, that was what Mireille had told herself.

Mireille&#39;s reflections were interrupted as she suddenly felt Kirika 
sucking on one of her breasts, while teasing the erect nipple with 
steady flicks of her tongue. In the meantime, one of the girl&#39;s hands 
began to rub and squeeze her other breast, the actions only occasionally 
broken by moments when she gave the stiff teat atop it loving attention.

Mireille swallowed hard and looked up to the dark ceiling as Kirika 
pleasured her skilfully, her lover now shifting her mouth to the other 
breast that craved her wonderful care. The girl traced the aureole of 
the blonde&#39;s breast with her tongue for a few moments, before licking 
the almost painfully hard nipple a couple of times, and then finally 
enveloping the prominent pinkish bud and as much of pliable, fleshy 
globe as she could with it in her wet mouth.

Mireille felt a new trickle of moisture develop between her spread legs. 
After a number of exploratory but enjoyable &#39;teaching experiences&#39; under 
Mireille&#39;s tutorage, Kirika had become quite the competent lover. 
Sometimes Mireille thought that perhaps the quiet girl knew her body 
even better than she herself did.

An indeterminable amount of time passed to Mireille; Kirika&#39;s devoted 
attention to her breasts causing her mind to be focused on other, more 
pleasant and current, things. Finally, Kirika ceased her exquisite 
affection for Mireille&#39;s chest, eliciting a consciously composed breath 
of air to emerge from the blonde that helped to calm her rising pulse 
rate... to a degree. Mireille placed a hand on Kirika&#39;s head as it then 
descended down her body, softly butterfly-kissing its way welcomingly to 
the drenched juncture between her thighs.

Mireille gasped and scrunched her fingers in Kirika&#39;s short tresses as 
the girl&#39;s tongue began to tentatively lap all over her vulva, purposely 
missing the throbbing spot that begged for the most attention. When at 
last she felt her lover penetrate her smoothly with two fingers and 
start to directly--and relentlessly--massage her special place inside 
her vagina, Mireille&#39;s eyes darted all over the room, searching for 
anything that could distract her from the intense sensations she was 
experiencing, before finally resting on her handbag where it lay on the 
couch a short distance off to the right of the bed. It was empty now, 
with the woman&#39;s Walther P99 nestled for safety&#39;s sake back under the 
bed below her and her lover. Even now, at a moment like this, it was a 
grim reminder to Mireille of what the future would ultimately contain 
for herself and Kirika. A future of violence and murder.

Mireille was suddenly brought back to the here and now as Kirika&#39;s 
tongue brushed her clitoris, before the girl began to suckle on it, 
giving her blonde lover what she so desired. The woman&#39;s eyes fell 
closed as she brought her left hand up to join her right on Kirika&#39;s 
head, and entwined her fingers in her partner&#39;s hair, as if to keep it 
in place where it was presently buried between her long legs. Now was 
not the time to dwell on such matters of what the future held. Mireille 
was here, right now, in her peaceful world with Kirika, the person she 
loved the most with all her heart. And, for the moment at least, that 
was all that was important.

Mireille&#39;s breathing started to rapidly increase as she allowed herself 
to be taken away by Kirika&#39;s knowledgeable mouth and fingers, putting 
all thoughts but of her lover out of her mind. She would reach the edge 
soon; she rarely lasted long when Kirika was serious about giving her 
pleasure. But that was fine. It would only be the woman&#39;s first climax 
of the evening... the first of many. And Kirika would undoubtedly need 
Mireille&#39;s adoring reciprocations, which the blonde would be more than 
happy to give her. The night was still young... and the day hadn&#39;t ended 
just yet.

******

Mireille lay naked on her back in the bed, with an equally unclothed 
Kirika beside her. Both were totally sated... for this night, at least. 
Mireille turned her head to Kirika, looking at the girl as she gazed 
vacantly up at the ceiling. It was very late, and they should have been 
asleep by now. But Mireille knew she wouldn&#39;t be able to just yet, not 
until she heard a certain phrase from a certain girl.

Sensing her lover&#39;s eyes on her, Kirika turned and looked at the woman 
next to her. &quot;Mireille,&quot; she breathed softly, her voice scarcely above a 
whisper, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Mireille smiled at the words she had ached to hear, and then draped one 
arm around her partner, before pulling her close to her body. Kirika 
snuggled up against the woman&#39;s taller frame, resting her head near the 
crook of her neck. Once she was certain the quiet girl had settled 
herself in a comfortable position, Mireille kissed her affectionately on 
the forehead.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; she answered just as quietly. The words came to her 
easily now, and without any hesitation. Mireille knew and accepted 
implicitly how she felt about Kirika; she had done so ever since the day 
they had first kissed.

Kirika smiled faintly at the declaration and then closed her eyes, 
allowing herself to drift off to sleep where she was cuddled close to 
Mireille, safe and content in the beautiful woman&#39;s arms. Mireille 
gently ran her free hand through Kirika&#39;s short locks, soothing her love 
into a deep slumber. The thread that tied them together was a deep, dark 
red now, and forever would be. Mireille knew that their peaceful world 
wouldn&#39;t be everlastingly, she knew that eventually either she herself, 
by her own free will, would be called back down the black path she had 
chosen to live her life along--bringing Kirika down with it--or some 
other incident or individual would do so. But, no matter what happened, 
Mireille and Kirika would face that path together. They may have not 
been the Noir that Altena had wished them to be, but they were a 
partnership of a sort. A formidable one. A deep one. A loving one. Their 
relationship had strengthened and their hearts had bonded even more 
closely, joined by a red thread. And while Mireille knew that the day 
when their world would change loomed ever closer; the black path they 
would surely travel down didn&#39;t look so black in her eyes. It looked to 
be tinged with red, and not with blood... but with love.

However, for present at least, the world was still blissful, still 
peaceful, and Mireille intended to enjoy it fully with Kirika... until 
that day arrived.

The End.


Author&#39;s ramblings:

And so ends my first one-shot fanfic. I hope it was decent. I could have 
made the yuri scene very long and very explicit, but I toned it down as 
much as I could since I didn&#39;t want it overshadowing the rest of the fic 
and making it become purely a lemon.

Character wise, I figured Mireille was the type to be a bit of a tease 
now, whereas I kept Kirika relatively taciturn as usual.

The picnic/painting scene was inspired by a particular image of Mireille 
and Kirika together.

I&#39;ve been considering writing a companion piece to this fanfic except 
from Kirika&#39;s point of view. Basically it would be the whole thing again 
(same events and such), except this time with Kirika&#39;s thoughts. I&#39;m not 
sure if I will yet.

I would appreciate feedback. Like I said before, this is for the Yuricon 
fanfic contest, so any suggestions on how to improve this fic would be 
welcome (just no grammar or spelling remarks please ^_^). As a result, 
this fanfic will probably be tinkered with a lot until I settle on a 
final version.

Thank you for reading!</pre>
