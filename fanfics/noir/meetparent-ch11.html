<h1>Meet the Parent (part 11 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Living the life just like couples were, it was as if all the times 
Mireille and Kirika had spent together before they became lovers were 
all nothing but the past that were completely over, something just the 
two of them had overcome greatly. Never ever Mireille Bouquet wished for 
anymore happiness than the whole life she had recently with her partner. 
Starting from about two weeks ago, she had had the most precious life 
she ever dreamed of, spending times with Kirika, who now had not only 
become her secret love. Since Mireille confessed to the Japanese girl, 
the time they spent together had been more and more wonderful as days 
passed on.

Mireille and Kirika must be grateful for all development of their 
relationship tough at first yes, both of them were a little shy to 
express their feeling. Lately, they could opened up their mind more to 
each other and did not feel awkward anymore to touch, hold hands, or 
else. The conversation too, was also getting more and more comfortable 
and enjoyable to them, as two of them now talked and laughed more.

They still had that kind gap of usual silence between them when talking, 
but never an uncomfortable one of it. Rather, it was now the silence 
they made on purpose their own to take their time, gazing onto each 
other eyes deeply, and smiled lovingly. Sometimes, not seldom, they also 
did more than just that.

Happy and thankful as she should be for what her life had become, 
Mireille did not yet feel completely so, as she could sense something 
troubling her mind. The thing was, be a lover of a daughter somehow made 
the blonde.. confused. Mireille would prefer to tell nobody about their 
relationship rather than babbling it out, that for sure. But, 
considering how close Kirika and Doctor Naomi had become, the Corsican 
girl felt responsible to tell the doctor about her and the brunette, not 
to mention the fear haunted in her heart, due to the possibility of be 
hated or despised by the female vet. She was rude to the vet in the 
past, no doubt, as she even pointed her gun at the Japanese girl&#39;s 
mother. Those facts somehow would likely make their love not acceptable, 
perhaps.

Kirika, innocent as she was, would not even aware of the consequences of 
loving the blonde whose gender was the same as her. Mireille was sure 
that she did not do anything wrong by loving the Japanese girl. The 
problem was, she heard that men from the east were still not used to 
accept same gender love. That one meant that, her relationship with the 
brunette would be questionable and maybe unacceptable, for Kirika&#39;s 
mother was Japanese.

In the middle of her daze, or rather her own stress, Mireille suddenly 
got a call. As Kirika was simply working, Mireille was the one to pick 
the phone up. Fortunately or maybe unfortunately for the blonde, the 
call led her to her problem, as the call was from Dr. Naomi, who invited 
her to the clinic to talk about some matters with Kirika. Too confused 
and a bit blank, the blonde gave the female vet a short &#39;yes&#39; answer 
right away, and after wearing her coat, walked to the clinic.

Greeted by a warm embrace and smile from Dr. Naomi, Mireille was led to 
the usual white living room. Found that the person she kept dearest to 
her was already waiting there, Mireille gave her lovers a smile, and sat 
beside her. The three of them had a friendly chit-chat as always before 
continuing to the main topic, which turned out to be pretty surprising 
for the blonde.

&quot;Go to Japan..??&quot; an obvious tone of confusion filled in Mireille&#39;s 
question. Gradually, the blonde&#39;s face turned out to be paler than any 
other woman in the room.

&quot;Well.. They asked me to bring her.&quot; Dr. Naomi repeated her last 
sentence in a happy tone, as she glanced at Mireille.

Mireille&#39;s eyes narrowed. The news was not something to make fuss of, 
she knew it. But still, being told that Kirika&#39;s family wanted to see, 
or meet the brunette for exact, somehow made uneasy impact to the 
blonde. Tough she somehow had mentally prepared herself to be ready to 
hear this thing.

&quot;So Kirika.. Can you come..?&quot; Dr. Naomi pleaded.

&quot;How long.. will it be..?&quot; The Japanese girl asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure yet.. But it&#39;s about one week.&quot;

&quot;You are coming back after it, right, Doctor..?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;Hmm..&quot; muttered the female vet as she grinned. &quot;Maybe..&quot;

Mireille&#39;s eyes opened up wider. Maybe..? Then what about Kirika..??

&quot;What do you mean by that, Doctor..?&quot; asked the blonde, curious.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s possible to not come back.&quot;

&quot;Can you tell me why..?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, no.&quot; Dr. Naomi said softly. &quot;Sort of.. family problems.&quot;

&quot;Do I.. really have to come..?&quot; the Japanese girl whispered timidly, 
hesitated to saying her question out loud.

Dr. Naomi looked at her daughter and said, &quot;I&#39;ll be really delighted if 
you will. I don&#39;t force you, anyway.&quot;

With that last sentence, a long silence hung between the three of them. 
Mireille, felt like it was not her place to talk first, decided to shut 
her mouth. Kirika, on the other hand, despite her expressionless face, 
was having a wrinkle on her forehead, which meant that she was thinking. 
The one who brought up the topic now was broadcasting her smile 
cheerfully. None could have guessed what exactly was in the female vet&#39;s 
mind right now, as so why she generously smiling since she met Mireille 
or maybe since before it, when the topic was not something somebody 
should be smiling enigmatically to anyone about.

&quot;Why.. don&#39;t you.. invite Mireille to come, too..?&quot; Kirika&#39;s soft voice 
broke the silence.

&quot;Oh.. It&#39;s up to her.&quot; Dr. Naomi answered calmly, not looked like a 
slightest bit surprised.

Mireille raised one of her eyebrows curiously.

&quot;Does it mean that she can come..?&quot; Kirika asked, suddenly full of 
spirit.

Doctor Naomi nodded lightly and continued to wear on her smiling face.

Kirika, obviously excited, glanced so suddenly at Mireille, made the 
latter blushed slightly at how close their faces had gotten.

&quot;You can come, Mireille.&quot; The brunette&#39;s eyes glittering in happiness, 
as she whispered the words to the blonde.

&quot;Uh.. Yes..&quot; mumbled Mireille, as she moved her head back up.

The Japanese girl in return looked more deeply in the blonde&#39;s blue eyes 
while giving her the look of questioning, her face looked sad. &quot;You.. 
don&#39;t want to come..?&quot;

&quot;No. I mean, I&#39;d love to, Kirika.&quot; Mireille said in hurry.

The Japanese girl smiled and turned her head back to face her mother. 
Stole a glance at the female vet, Mireille could see that the doctor&#39;s 
smile grew even so wider she herself felt curious whether the doctor was 
holding off her laughter.

Mireille cleared her throat and asked, &quot;Is it really okay if I come..?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; replied Dr. Naomi. &quot;But it is likely that you won&#39;t stay in our 
house, Mireille. I guess you know why.&quot;

&quot;..Yes.&quot; answered Mireille shortly.

The blonde knew that being an old family, and a pretty strict one it 
seemed, it was kind of impossible that an outsider such as herself will 
just warmly be welcomed to live in Kirika&#39;s family house and wandered 
freely around for just some times, not to mention the acknowledgement 
from two of their house members.

The reason was sufficiently clear for Mireille, tough one person in the 
room obviously didn&#39;t get it.

&quot;Why..?&quot; Kirika asked innocently.

&quot;It seems impossible for the head family to receive an unknown guest, 
Kirika.&quot; Dr. Naomi explained slowly.

&quot;But.. she isn&#39;t.. an&#151;&quot;

&quot;Yes, she isn&#39;t for the two of us. But for the head family, she is.&quot; Dr. 
Naomi said softly.

&quot;.. then, where will Mireille live..?&quot; the Japanese girl asked, puzzled.

&quot;I can rent an apartment there.&quot; the blonde said lightly, despite her 
mentally problem. The problem is, whether you can come back here with me 
or not, Kirika..! Geez..!

The brunette didn&#39;t say anything more after that, as she looked down at 
her foot and shut her mouth.

&quot;When to go, then..?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;Saturday. Two days from now.&quot; answered the female vet, still smiling.

&quot;..Okay.&quot;

&quot;Is it alright for you, Kirika..?&quot;

The girl in question looked up in surprise, as she just remained in daze 
before. &quot;..Yes.&quot;

&quot;Well.. Well..&quot; Doctor Naomi grinned. &quot;I wonder what are you thinking..&quot;

&quot;It&#151;&quot;

&quot;Let me guess.&quot; The female vet cut off the word, as her eyes twinkled in 
excitement. The doctor looked like waiting for this moment, as she made 
her voice as low and a-super-secret as possible. &quot;You want to be with 
Mireille, don&#39;t you..?&quot; she whispered naughtily.

Seeing Kirika blushed at the word, Mireille kind of found her cheeks 
also felt hotter than usual. As the blonde was thinking in panic, trying 
to find the word to describe everything she wanted to tell the female 
vet, she heard somebody laughter. Looked up, she saw that the audible 
sound however, came from Doctor Naomi.

Mireille, slightly annoyed, looked in perplexity at the older woman. 
&quot;Something.. funny..?&quot;

&quot;Sorry.. &quot; the female vet&#39;s eyes became teary as she hold off her 
laughter. &quot;It&#39;s just.. interesting to see how cute and shy the two of 
you are.&quot;

Mireille glanced at her lovers beside, and found the brunette was the in 
the same boat with her, confusion.

&quot;So.. You know that..&quot; Mireille hesitated. &quot;We are.. in love..?&quot;

Smiling in satisfaction to herself, Dr. Naomi replied, &quot;Of course.&quot;

Is that why she keep smiling.. mysteriously..?

Mireille narrowed her eyes once again, thinking all plausible options of 
why the female vet knew how things going between her and Kirika. They 
never acted like one in front of Dr. Naomi, after all. The blonde took a 
glance at the Japanese girl. Judging from the current condition and the 
close relationship between the brunette and her mother now, it was very 
likely that Kirika told her mother about it, but.. looking at how 
innocent and embarrassed the Japanese girl&#39;s face was, it somehow felt 
not the right conclusion.

Nervousness, confusion, embarrassment and many other things mixed up the 
feeling in her heart, Mireille decided to raise her head and looked at 
her beloved&#39;s mother, who was smiling in victory.

&quot;I figured it out myself.&quot; Dr. Naomi finally admitted after receiving 
Mireille&#39;s questioning gaze.

&quot;..How..?&quot;

&quot;Well..&quot; the female vet sighed. &quot;How could I don&#39;t know..? When my 
daughter smiling more and more often every days she comes after going 
home.. Or when her eyes twinkling when she said something about you, or 
when she seemed to be lovingly and caressingly careful when she said 
your name, Mireille..?&quot; The doctor put on a heavy emphasis on the 
blonde&#39;s name.

Swallowed the long explanation carefully, Mireille blushed slightly and 
sank deep in her own embarrass at her love relationship. Kirika was the 
same, as her face had coloured in deep red as if all her blood was 
flowing upside down, all to her face.

&quot;Sorry to not telling you first, Doctor.&quot; Mireille apologized in a low 
voice.

&quot;Ah.. It&#39;s okay.&quot;

&quot;So..&quot; the blonde muttered as she faced the female vet. &quot;Are you okay 
with.. that?&quot;

Dr. Naomi looked like considering something before answered, &quot;No.&quot;

At that short and cold answer, Mireille could feel something stabbed her 
heart and stop its function for a second. The couple were now looking at 
Dr. Naomi hopelessly, obviously disappointed and speechless. A short 
silence stretched afterwards.

&quot;..Why..?&quot; Mireille finally decide to ask, her voice desperate. If her 
lover&#39;s mother did not accept their relationship, this would be a 
serious problem. A very frustrating one, also.

&quot;Because.. I will not accept it for eternity, unless you make her really 
happy.&quot; The female vet added with a serious tone, yet a bit joking.

Mireille blinked. &quot;That&#39;s mean..&quot;

&quot;Promise me.&quot; Dr. Naomi said seriously as she looked deeply to the 
blonde.

&quot;I will.&quot; Mireille spontaneously replied.

&quot;Good to hear.&quot; said Dr. Naomi. &quot;I am no one to decide though. It&#39;s all 
up to Kirika.&quot; the female vet looked at the brunette.

Realized the attention was all focused to her, the Japanese girl just 
let out a small nod shyly.

&quot;Thank you, Doctor.&quot; said the blonde, smiling in relief.

The oldest woman chuckled. &quot;Don&#39;t be that formal. How about both of you 
go back home..? Seems like it&#39;s getting dark outside.&quot;

Regardless of the fact that a parent whose child hadn&#39;t married yet was 
supposed to live together, while the one Kirika had was living nearby, 
Dr. Naomi had kindly allowed the Japanese girl to just live freely 
anywhere she wanted to, which was the reason why the doctor offered them 
to go back home. Mireille smiled at her lover&#39;s mother, especially at 
how unselfish and understandable the doctor was, beside for her and the 
brunette&#39;s relationship.

The blonde glanced at Kirika, gesturing her to make the decision whether 
to go back home or not. The Japanese girl glanced at the female vet and 
replied with a small nod.

&quot;Okay then..&quot; Dr. Naomi smiled, stood up and led the two younger girls 
to the front door.

A few while passing the clinic&#39;s room, the three of them had arrived 
outside.

Mireille smiled and bowed deeply. &quot;See you later, Doc.&quot;

&quot;See you too, Mireille. Don&#39;t forget, two days to prepare.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Kirika then gave her mother a warm embrace as she whispered her goodbye, 
a usual thing between them now, as the mother and her child had become 
pretty close. A nice improvement from Kirika, Mireille recalled, that 
the Japanese girl had opened up herself to hug and showed affection 
towards a person.

With that short farewell, both Mireille and Kirika left the clinic, 
waving their hands on the way back to their apartment.

The couple decided to walk slowly on their way, relaxing their self in 
the scent of the cold and windy night, as their hands clutched to each 
other. They came out in a pretty late night and the sky was already 
dark, but there were still many couples passed the two of them, some of 
whom totally looked like shocked to see and realize the reason why 
Mireille and Kirika were holding hands in such romantic way. Pretty used 
to the unbelieving stare, the blonde ignored it completely and kept 
walking down the pavement with Kirika to reach their apartment.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you want to join..&quot; Kirika&#39;s soft and melodious voice slowly 
reached the blonde&#39;s ears.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to be with you, too.&quot; Mireille smiled and caressed the 
brunette&#39;s cheek affectionately.

Kirika smiled in return to the blonde, as her cheeks turned even redder. 
The Japanese girl leaned herself closer to Mireille&#39;s left arm, now not 
afraid to hurt or touch the wound that was once there before as it had 
totally healed.

They kept each other tight, until the blonde unwillingly let go to 
unlock the apartment door. Afterwards, Mireille and Kirika took a bath 
together, and sneaked in bed right after, both covered themselves with 
the blanket first, before slowly snuggled to each other. It had been a 
habit now, to talk in bed rather than the tea table, as they simply 
could cuddle easily this way.

Being in bed together with her lovers and enjoyed to feel the heat and 
hear the slow breath rhythm of her, Mireille wouldn&#39;t even care for all 
crisis and problems in the world when they lied down close to each 
other, for the person was her dearest lovers. Both face turned to see 
each other, the two of them smiled in a romantic way. Gazed lovingly at 
the big brown orbs next to her while her arms slowly proceeded to circle 
the brunette&#39;s slim waist, Mireille opened up the conversation.

&quot;We haven&#39;t packed yet, right..?&quot; the blonde asked.

&quot;Yes.&quot; the Japanese girl answered.

&quot;Do you want to do it..?&quot; Mireille tried to keep her voice as firm and 
serious as she can, despite her unwillingness to do what she herself 
offered.

&quot;No.&quot; replied the brunette as she leaned closer to the blonde and 
reached Mireille&#39;s back with her hands. &quot;Tomorrow.. will do.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Mireille slowly moved her hands to the Japanese girl&#39;s back and 
pushed her to lean even closer and gave her a soft peck on the lips.

Blushed at the sudden action, the brunette asked in a low voice, &quot;She 
said that.. we may not come back, Mireille.&quot;

&quot;Yes..&quot; the blonde replied weakly.

&quot;You can&#39;t live in Japan.. forever..?&quot; the brunette asked innocently, 
her eyes showed desire.

&quot;Maybe.. I can. But it will take time.&quot;

&quot;I want to.. be with you, Mireille.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to live.. with your family..?&quot; the Corsican girl looked 
at her love incredulously. &quot;I won&#39;t force you not to.&quot;

&quot;..A little. &quot; Kirika mumbled softly.

&quot;So you prefer be with me.., my dearest love..?&quot; Mireille grinned as she 
teased the brunette.

Kirika blushed and buried her face down at the blonde&#39;s body. &quot;..Maybe.&quot; 
she grumbled in an unclear voice.

&quot;Your mom can help, if you really want something, right..?&quot; Mireille 
suggested as she brushed Kirika&#39;s curly brown hair. &quot;She is.. pretty 
kind to us.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; the brunette yawned slightly.

&quot;You&#39;re tired. Let&#39;s.. &quot; Mireille looked at her lovers in her arms and 
found that the brunette had already fallen asleep. &quot;..Sleep.&quot;

Smiling, the blonde hold the person she cherished the most firm in her 
arms and slowly closed her eyes peacefully.

-----------------

The next morning, wandering aimlessly in the living room I the 
apartment, Mireille felt bored as she had nothing to do after she fed 
Adeleine, due to her broken laptop which now was in progress of being 
repaired. Remembering how beautiful and innocent her lovers face was 
when she felt asleep last night, Mireille smiled. The Japanese girl was 
now also working, as today was her working day. Funny to think though, 
that such deadly assassin could live a life as a vet assistant. Neither 
Kirika nor Mireille complain a peaceful live they had, anyhow.

Mireille got to admit that she sometimes kind of missed her times of 
being an assassin together with Kirika. The feeling like dying by how 
tense and worse the situation had gotten sometimes, the encounter with 
total strangers, the secret identity they got to keep, and more else. 
But none of it could compare with the source of happiness the blonde 
felt in her heart when she saw the brunette looked like enjoying the 
peaceful life she had. That was why the blonde decided to just stop 
receiving request for assassination.

Occupied by her own thought of life, Mireille almost jumped when she 
heard a knocking sound at the door. Vigilance as always, the blonde took 
her gun and moved closer to the door. She was already prepared to turn 
the door&#39;s handle and pointed her gun when she heard the guest&#39;s voice.

&quot;It&#39;s me. Open up.&quot; the voice calmly commanded.

Pretty annoyed and at the same time surprised, Mireille didn&#39;t answer 
and moved her hand from the door&#39;s handle. Suddenly she had a bad 
feeling that she knew who was standing behind the door.

&quot;Can&#39;t you hurry..? This is me, Chloe.&quot;

Shit..!

Mireille hesitated at first but carefully opened up the door and pointed 
her gun right forward in the air later. As expected, a figure of green 
cloaked girl standing steadily flashed in her eyes. Pretty familiar with 
the purple haired kid, Mireille couldn&#39;t fail to notice some visible 
change of Chloe. The latter seemed to be thinner and paler, and a bit 
unhealthy as her eyes seemed darker and reflected great exhaustion 
rather than some chill cold stare she always had and used at Mireille.

Still pointed the gun to the younger girl, the Corsican girl couldn&#39;t 
help but snapped. &quot;What do you want..? Still challenging me..? Sorry to 
refuse but you bette&#151;&quot;

&quot;Please let me in first.&quot; Chloe asked calmly, completely ignoring the 
gun. Her eyes steadily stared at Mireille&#39;s.

Please..? Since when have she learnt to use that word..??

Pretty curious, the blonde said, &quot;Only if you promise not to fight or 
hurt me. Or threatening me in any way you can.&quot;

Even a Chloe had her pride to say &#39;please&#39;, Mireille knew it.

The later nodded slowly.

Mireille lowered the gun and led the uninvited guest to the table. The 
blonde threw herself to the chair first, before motioned the green 
cloaked girl to do the same.

&quot;Do you want some tea..?&quot; Mireille offered.

&quot;No thanks.&quot;

Silence. Mireille waited patiently for a word to be let out from the 
purple haired girl&#39;s lips. Ten minutes flew by as not a word came out 
from the younger one&#39;s lips since her last thanking words. Anybody who 
seen the awkwardness of the condition between the two of them must be 
laughing, at seeing how confused Mireille&#39;s face was and how desperate 
the purple haired kid looked like. Pretty bizarre.

What the heck does she want to talk about..??!

The blonde cleared her throat. &quot;So.. What brings you here..?&quot;

Chloe looked up and said, &quot;You are leaving soon, right..?&quot;

&quot;How do you know..?&quot; the blonde suddenly felt aware once again at how 
suspicious the kid in front of her was.

&quot;I just know.&quot;

Being a mature lady as she already was, Mireille felt the urge to teach 
the purple haired kid some manner of speaking to someone older than 
herself. The blonde forget about it though, as her focus once again was 
drawn to Chloe&#39;s sentence.

&quot;You must..&quot; Chloe paused and looked deeply in the owner of the blue 
eyes. &quot;take care of yourself.&quot;

&quot;I have already.&quot; Mireille protested, puzzled at the heavy and serious 
tone the purple hair girl was using. &quot;Why..?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll warn you.&quot; Chloe said seriously. &quot;This may be an unexpected trip.&quot;</pre>
