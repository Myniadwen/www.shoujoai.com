Chapter 7 - Sinners, Act I


Kaede Ishinomori examined her series of finely honed instruments through 
her snow-white bangs with an appraising eye, where they were laid out in 
a silver tray on a square table before her. Their smooth metallic 
surfaces glinted vibrantly, reflecting the flames flickering in the 
fireplace inset on one wall of the lavishly decorated but Spartanly 
furnished room. During the last session their rigorous use and seen them 
become quite soiled, requiring them to be thoroughly cleansed and 
polished until they shone radiantly, almost bathed in a holy aura. 
Kaede&#39;s craft was an art form that called extensively upon her utensils, 
both exotic and ordinary alike. Even the most everyday of items could be 
used to beguile a subject closer to enlightenment.

The brick fireplace was the sole source of light in the otherwise 
gloomy, spacious room, generating an overall sinister atmosphere, the 
air thick with dark foreboding. Two cast iron pokers rested in the 
crackling flames of the fireplace, their ends glowing a hot orange, 
having been in their for a significant amount of time. They would be 
needed later to prevent the subject&#39;s premature departure before 
they--or he, in this case--had reached the exalted plateau of celestial 
favour. The human shell was so fragile. But it did serve to restrict 
blessed illumination to only those whose bodies could endure the 
hallowed ordeal Kaede so fastidiously administered with her skilled 
hands. If not, then any unworthy heathen could achieve transcendence.

A willowy, pale hand hovered lazily over the tray of instruments as 
Kaede mulled her choices, pausing for fleeting moments on each one, 
although it was an act to heighten the subject&#39;s state of anticipation 
more than anything else. Or rather, his state of *fear*. Fear caused the 
body to produce adrenaline, resulting in a subject being able to undergo 
more trials than she or he normally would, and hence, bring them nearer 
to enlightenment at a faster pace. Nevertheless, Kaede wondered why this 
subject was still so frightened. He should feel privileged; it wasn&#39;t as 
though she treated all the people under her to this honour. Although, 
Matsumoto *had* strayed from her fold, betraying her to outsiders and 
their foul, warped word of law; for whatever reason be it money or a 
misguided conscience. Naturally, that was one of the primary motivations 
behind Kaede choosing to bestow the gift of sacred revelation upon 
him... through *pain*. She would compel the wayward Matsumoto to repent 
his sins, and in turn, hasten his inevitable journey towards the 
Heavens, with his soul clean and ready to be judged by the Gods.

Not that Matsumoto could verbally repent. A muffled and pathetic mewling 
came from the man on Kaede&#39;s left as her hand lingered over an electric 
prod, her slender fingers crooking downwards to caress the device 
lovingly. Kaede had quickly tired of Matsumoto&#39;s pleading once she had 
begun her purification ritual--the symphony of screams a woman produced 
when in a state of torment were far more pleasing to the 
ear--consequently inciting her to cut out the offending jabbering muscle 
to cease the infernal prattle. However, after sealing the ensuing wound 
with the sanitising heat of searing hot iron, the inconsiderate man had 
then taken to whining and snivelling like a little boy, further 
bothering Kaede. So, she decided to close the vexing orifice 
permanently. A sharp needle and strong fishing line had a million uses.

Kaede&#39;s hands resumed their meander above the tray, leaving the prod and 
moving on to other implements of torture. Electricity was an efficient 
means to inflict varying degrees of pain upon a subject without dealing 
permanent damage to her or his body. Yet the white-haired woman had 
learnt through great practice that males had a superior natural 
resistance to the agony of an electrical charge ravaging their muscles 
than females did, so nowadays she tended to reserve that particular form 
of anguish for those of the feminine allegiance. Most women could be 
cowed into doing almost anything to avoid electricity&#39;s sharp sting... 
much to Kaede&#39;s delight.

Kaede&#39;s eyes drifted away from her beloved instruments to take in her 
errant &#39;bodyguard&#39;; her trademark perpetual, faint, and distant smile 
glued to her features. Matsumoto hung naked from the ceiling by two 
lengths of chain; his wrists in manacles and his arms stretched 
painfully taut into the air, the weak muscles of the limbs visibly 
straining pitifully against their treatment. Equally restrained were the 
man&#39;s legs, held fast by cuffed ankles affixed to a third and fourth set 
of chains bolted firmly to rings embedded in the grey slate tiled floor. 
The subject&#39;s bonds were pulled so tightly that he could barely squirm a 
centimetre. As they should be. Kaede couldn&#39;t have Matsumoto fidgeting 
while she was trying to save his soul, after all. It would be irritating 
to say the least.

The trim young woman, dressed plainly in a grey tank top and shorts--her 
nightwear--turned fully to face Matsumoto and placed her hands on her 
hips, striking a thoughtful pose. She looked over the subject&#39;s body 
with an evaluating gaze, gauging how much more his shell could 
withstand. The man&#39;s hands were simply twin balls of meat, the digits 
that had once adorned them having been severed by one manner or another, 
leaving behind in their place a mess of cauterised flesh where Kaede had 
touched them with a glowing poker retrieved from the fireplace. Lower, 
old dried scabs and freshly torn tissue revealing raw red beneath, where 
the rough edges of his metal shackles had harshly cut into his skin, 
ringed Matsumoto&#39;s wrists. The man had struggled mightily in his 
restraints in the beginning, depleting much of his strength and with 
only severely chafed wrists--and ankles also--to show for his ultimately 
wasted labours. No longer did he fight, however. Matsumoto&#39;s shell had 
now dedicated its faculties totally towards merely sustaining its bare 
minimum of functions that were vital for survival.

Kaede&#39;s veiled eyes descended to the subject&#39;s neck, where yet more 
blood encrusted bands disfigured his flesh, along with a spattering of 
dark purple bruises. At several points in previous sessions, the woman 
had throttled Matsumoto with an assortment of objects--rope, wire, 
cloth; and several times with her bare hands. But under stringent 
circumstances, of course. Controlled asphyxiation could cause a 
substantial amount of burning woe to the sufferer&#39;s lungs, and in turn 
their whole body in general, but it had to be strictly regulated. Too 
much invariably resulted in premature death--one had to monitor the 
subject most carefully to prolong the torturous yet liberating 
experience. Why, once Kaede had kept one subject with a tight noose 
around her neck alive for more than an hour and a half by lowering her 
back to her tiptoes for twenty minutes or so whenever it seemed that she 
was drawing close to the point of no return. When the blessed woman had 
finally expired, she had dangled in the air by her neck for at least a 
full hour all together. Kaede was sure that particular subject had 
reached glorious enlightenment at the end.

Kaede&#39;s thoughts returned from the past to her latest subject, her gaze 
roaming over his ripped and bludgeoned form. Matsumoto&#39;s left leg was 
bent at an odd angle, the knee joint having been crushed to a pulp when 
she&#39;d had the sudden impulse to deliver a blow with a small mallet to 
it. The man had howled terribly at that, the scream made all the more 
grotesque since he had lacked a tongue at the time. It was one of the 
things that had provoked Kaede into stitching up his lips a short period 
later. Really, a feminine shriek was infinitely more beautiful than a 
masculine one.

Kaede&#39;s smile widened just a tad once her eyes found their way to 
Matsumoto&#39;s bloody crotch. She wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he could hit the 
high notes now, however, despite being a man. A male&#39;s spirit was prone 
to shatter quicker when ruthlessly robbed of his manhood, a supposition 
that Kaede more often than not proved to ring true with all of her male 
subjects. The poor fools were reduced to whimpering, compliant children 
after such a... demoralising... dismemberment.

&quot;What to do, what to do,&quot; Kaede remarked in a singsong voice, tapping a 
whimsical finger on her chin. Her gaze went to Matsumoto&#39;s more or less 
unharmed face; the only really noticeable damage his somewhat swollen 
mouth. &quot;Ah, yes, I remember,&quot; the lissom woman said, as if it had 
suddenly dawned on her. In truth, she&#39;d had a motive for abstaining from 
inflicting harm to Matsumoto&#39;s visage, a motive she intended to come to 
fruition. Right now.

Kaede turned back to her tray, plucking a pile of about a dozen, ten 
centimetre long, flexible needles from the selection of apparatus 
available. Her all but unwavering smile still on her face, she returned 
her attention to Matsumoto, who quivered as best he could in his chains 
at the sight of the needles in her hand. There were benefits to letting 
a subject keep their eyes, the woman reflected.

Kaede took a single step forwards to the subject, her heart rate 
quickening as the sweet and exciting sense of anticipation enveloped 
her. Taking short, rapid breaths, she pulled one needle out of the 
bundle, flourishing it before Matsumoto&#39;s terror-stricken eyes. The man 
thrashed against his bonds with renewed vigour, although amid the 
combination of his ailing strength and virtually unyielding restraints, 
it didn&#39;t make much more than the most marginal of differences.

&quot;Now, now; none of that,&quot; Kaede chided as she replaced the heap of 
needles back on the tray before grasping a clump of Matsumoto&#39;s short 
brown hair in her now free hand, holding his head in place as he moaned 
weakly. &quot;Be good and stay still...&quot; she cooed soothingly while she 
brought the sharp thin needle in her other hand up to the subject&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;that&#39;s it....&quot;

Apparently comprehending what she intended to do, Matsumoto squeezed his 
eyes shut tightly in a meagre attempt to thwart the inescapable--his 
shell still had a little kick left in it after all. But Kaede would have 
none of it. Shifting the hand behind Matsumoto&#39;s head a fraction, she 
forcibly pried open his right eyelid with her thumb, exposing the 
frantic orb underneath. The man&#39;s eye darted wildly around the room for 
a few seconds, but then focused unswervingly on the shiny silver needle 
brandished in Kaede&#39;s right hand as it grew larger and larger in his 
vision, its dreaded course glaringly clear.

&quot;There are numerous pain receptors behind the eyes,&quot; Kaede explained 
absently as pulled Matsumoto&#39;s eyelid back further. &quot;Unfortunately, 
these can only be reached by inserting a fine needle under the top 
eyelid.&quot; She paused in both speech and motion, and one corner of her 
lips twitched slightly as her smile took on an almost impish quality. 
&quot;But luckily for you, I happen to have a few of said needles.&quot;

Without any more delay, Kaede inserted the flexible needle in the exact 
spot she had just mentioned, lodging it deeply into Matsumoto&#39;s eye 
socket, nestling it just above his optic nerve. She then quickly let it 
go, the springy metal bouncing back and forth.

Matsumoto&#39;s stifled, yet still piercing scream echoed around the room as 
he jerked spasmodically, the pain consuming him... and hence, curing his 
soul of more of its taint. Simply magnificent.

The grand double door entrance to the room to Kaede&#39;s rear creaked open, 
accompanied by the click of high heels on slate. The clicks stopped 
shortly afterwards, and a longsuffering sigh followed while a second 
creak signalled the doors were being shut.

&quot;I see I&#39;ll most likely have to get someone in to clean this floor 
again,&quot; a woman&#39;s smoky voice commented resignedly.

Kaede spared a glance over her shoulder from her work at the newcomer, 
although she already knew who was standing there behind her. Garbed in a 
crisp black dress suit and a cream coloured silk shirt, Dominique 
D&#39;Aubigne painted a very cultured picture. But even if clad in rags the 
woman would still make for a fine depiction of sophistication. Standing 
a dash below six foot and with long, straight, glossy black locks that 
fell to the peak of her thighs, Dominique was an imposing person to say 
the least. Her distinctly feminine figure was trim but full in all the 
right places, as befitting to most westerners, and her features were 
delicate yet defined with high cheekbones and a slender nose, where on 
the latter a pair of stylish oval glasses was perched, emerald green 
eyes shining behind them. She was, to put it simply, quite stunning. 
Dominique was approaching middle age, creeping into her forties at the 
very least, but barely a wrinkle could be seen tarnishing her milky 
white skin. There was, however, a streak of silvery grey in her dark 
tresses hanging next to the left side of her face. But rather than 
detract from her beauty, it instead enhanced it.

Dominique had been in the Ishinomori family&#39;s employ for as long as 
Kaede could remember, ever since she was a young child. She had acted as 
Kaede&#39;s mother&#39;s personal assistant, and had also been the late woman&#39;s 
close confidant for many years. These days, with her mother&#39;s passing, 
Dominique had adopted her former role with Kaede, becoming her assistant 
and advisor. But, in some ways, she was more than that. The French woman 
had always been there for Kaede--she was like her guardian. Her friend. 
In short, Dominique D&#39;Aubigne was one of the few people Kaede genuinely 
trusted. And considering that the sensuous lady was born and bred 
Soldats stock, that was certainly saying something.

&quot;It&#39;s getting on in hours, my Lady Kaede,&quot; Dominique crooned, pointedly 
paying no attention to the high-pitched screeches emanating from 
Matsumoto as Kaede had the first needle&#39;s companions join it in 
protruding from his eye socket, methodically spacing the instruments of 
torture along its upper half. &quot;I&#39;m sure your... &#39;toys&#39;... are keeping 
your bed warm for you... perhaps you should grace them with your 
presence.&quot;

&quot;Any news from Big Brother?&quot; Kaede asked as she slid another needle 
above the subject&#39;s eyeball, ignoring her advisor&#39;s subtle suggestion.

There was a slight silence from Dominique, so brief that it was hardly 
apparent, before she answered. &quot;None, my Lady,&quot; the woman said, &quot;but 
rest assured I will inform you right away as soon as I hear word from 
him.&quot;

Kaede nodded and shifted her ministrations to Matsumoto&#39;s other eye, 
leaving behind a semi-circle of spines jutting out of the man&#39;s right 
eye socket. He didn&#39;t howl any longer and barely convulsed as his 
white-haired redeemer wedged a needle over the top his left, unseeing 
eye; its depths void of awareness. The subject was close.

&quot;And what of local developments?&quot; Kaede inquired.

&quot;Much the same, my dear,&quot; Dominique reported in a somewhat wearisome 
tone. &quot;The Sumiyoshi-kai remain in disarray, with no subsidiary group 
having successfully claimed leadership of the clan just yet--and no 
clear likelihood that one ever will in the foreseeable future. I doubt 
they will offer much resistance--they are too busy fighting amongst 
themselves--although with the threat of our organisation, it may serve 
to unite them. But there is nothing we can do about that. Regardless, I 
foresee an easy victory over them.&quot; Dominique took a moment to clear her 
throat, and then resumed. &quot;Talks continue with the proxy leaders of the 
Yamaguchi-gumi, with little progress. They believe us to be merely 
another organised crime syndicate, and as such are treating us as one 
attempting to ally with them. It may cause problems when they learn the 
truth. But for now, we are on good terms. The Kansai region is becoming 
unprofitable for them; a new collaborator would inject much-needed funds 
and life into the ailing yakuza clan. I hear they have been trying to 
expand into the Kanto region in search of new business, which will 
sooner or later instigate a war with the Sumiyoshi-kai, united or 
divided. I recommend having some of our eyes-and-ears keep a watch on 
their progress throughout the territory. This situation can perhaps be 
exploited to our advantage.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kaede mumbled idly in agreement, more interested in saving 
Matsumoto&#39;s soul than the cold war with the country&#39;s underworld at 
present.

&quot;The other yakuza clans that haven&#39;t already been devoured will be 
consumed once all of the gangs under the Sumiyoshi-kai and the 
Yamaguchi-gumi are inducted into our ranks or dissolved; it&#39;s only a 
matter of time,&quot; Dominique went on, before hesitating, as if something 
offensive had caught in her throat. &quot;As for... *them*, their loathsome 
presence has been all but purged from the major cities in the Kanagawa 
prefecture save for their persisting entrenchments in Kawasaki. However, 
their agents still somehow find the means to strike against us on our 
own grounds, even here in Yokohama. Loses have been... tolerable, but 
the disturbances discredit us with our &#39;partners&#39;, both current and... 
impending.&quot;

&quot;Soldats...&quot; Kaede whispered softly, and then abruptly jammed another 
needle rather violently into Matsumoto&#39;s left eye socket. Her aim was 
slightly off however, and the sharp point pierced the white of the man&#39;s 
eye, passing straight through the glutenous inside of the orb before 
bursting into the skull&#39;s cavity. Matsumoto didn&#39;t so much as flinch.

&quot;Child, I believe that man&#39;s senses have become numb,&quot; Dominique 
interjected into Kaede&#39;s session. &quot;You *have* been &#39;attending&#39; to him 
for in excess of a week now.&quot;

Kaede ceased planting needles in Matsumoto&#39;s eye sockets and looked at 
him closely. He sagged heavily in his chains and his breathing was 
hoarse and shallow. &quot;Yes...&quot; the white-haired young woman hissed in 
approval, her tone taking on an impassioned timbre, &quot;he has grown beyond 
this plane of reality, beyond this stunted level of thought to another 
place, far removed from all mundane things. He has fully accepted the 
pain into his shell, into his mind and his very spirit, and thus it has 
bestowed upon him divine understanding of his true existence.&quot; Kaede 
sighed in joyous wonder. &quot;He has been favoured with enlightenment!&quot;

&quot;...Of course, my lady,&quot; Dominique said quietly.

Quickly, Kaede unlocked Matsumoto&#39;s--or more accurately, the trappings 
that contained the man&#39;s soon-to-be ascending soul--shackles and 
carefully lowered him to the floor, where a black body bag awaited. 
Arranging the subject in its snug confines, she then zipped up the bag 
to about three-quarters of the way, insuring that the fading shell could 
still feed on its last vestiges of needed oxygen.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you put him out of his misery?&quot; Dominique queried as she 
stood beside Kaede&#39;s kneeling form, folding her arms and looking 
distastefully down at Matsumoto&#39;s shell. &quot;Traitorous male,&quot; she sneered, 
her words laced with heavy scorn.

&quot;It can&#39;t die yet,&quot; Kaede informed her aide, stroking the rubbery 
material of the body bag with one hand, drawing circular patterns as she 
watched the shell&#39;s face, the tops of his eyes still riddled with a 
curved line of needles. Removing them might drag Matsumoto back from the 
brink--it was a chance Kaede was not willing to take. &quot;This state must 
be prolonged. I am not so cruel as to deny Matsumoto&#39;s soul the scant 
handful of moments to bathe in its newfound understanding before it 
rises to the Heavens. He was a betrayer, but he has been redeemed; the 
defilement in him has been banished. I am confident he has repented for 
his sins.&quot;

&quot;They are *all* full of defilement, Lady Kaede,&quot; Dominique remarked 
disdainfully, her beautiful features twisting as she continued to look 
down upon Matsumoto&#39;s shell. &quot;And there is no redeeming them. The sooner 
you learn that, the better.&quot;

Kaede looked up at Dominique, tilting her head slightly to one side. 
&quot;&#39;All&#39;?&quot; she parroted, before shaking her head, her lower lip pouting 
out a little, making her seem like a argumentative child. She still 
smiled however, causing the expression to appear rather odd as well. 
&quot;No, no; Big Brother is not tainted.&quot;

Dominique let out a low, throaty chuckle, smiling tolerantly down at 
Kaede. She reached down and indulgently brushed the young woman&#39;s pale 
cheek with the fingertips of one hand. &quot;Poor, na&iuml;ve darling,&quot; she 
whispered sympathetically, before straightening. &quot;Come along now,&quot; she 
then said in a louder and sterner voice, &quot;I will have someone fetch 
Matsumoto&#39;s &#39;shell&#39; later. You really must retire to bed.&quot;

Kaede nodded obediently, and then rose to her feet, joining her advisor 
as the statuesque woman led the way out of the room. Big Brother. She 
prayed he was all right. He had been gone for so long. But his 
assignment was necessary, or so Dominique said. It was a mission that 
would ultimately help them in combating Soldats. And when it came to 
Soldats, Kaede would do everything in her power to bring the corrupt 
society down. There was no repentance for them.

******

&quot;Cold night,&quot; Mireille remarked offhandedly, glad that she had worn her 
coat for their latest outing into the city&#39;s underbelly... as pointless 
as it had been. Her breath fogged the air ahead of her as she walked 
down the shadowy and empty Paris streets together with Kirika, a 
testament that winter was just around the corner. Soon Mireille wouldn&#39;t 
be able to wear miniskirts any more, unless she was willing to brave the 
coming chill.

Mireille&#39;s eyes turned to look upon Kirika, but the girl merely mumbled 
a vague agreement and inclined her head a fraction, her eyes remaining 
fastened to the footpath she was travelling along.

Mireille sighed, a plumb of mist blooming in front of her face; a larger 
one this time. It had been days since they had put the word out that 
they were searching for Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu--or to be 
more precise, &#39;Noir&#39;--but so far not a single snitch nor information 
dealer had unearthed anything noteworthy. Not even Simon, with his 
supposed network of spies, had been able to learn of anything. The boy 
had apologised profusely to Mireille for his failure to date, but his 
worthless regrets did nothing to bring her and Kirika any closer to 
their enemies. This drought of data concerning the false Noir did 
nothing to quell the unpleasant distance between Mireille and her 
partner. Wherever Ryosuke and Vincent were hiding, they were adept at 
concealing themselves.

It was very late into the evening, Mireille and Kirika having been out 
and about in the city since early morning, paying each of the blonde&#39;s 
sources a visit to obtain an update on their progress. Needless to say, 
the pair&#39;s efforts had been for naught. Each day that passed was marked 
with a gradually heightening sense of frustration to Mireille--that, and 
a sense of desolation, hopelessness. The passing days not only signified 
the skill Ryosuke and Vincent possessed at laying low--and the apparent 
lack of skill Mireille&#39;s informants had at sniffing them out--but also 
the increasing breakdown in the blonde woman&#39;s relationship with her 
diminutive counterpart. Whenever the sun rose on the horizon for a new 
day, Kirika&#39;s spirits seemed to conversely diminish just a little bit 
more. It had come to a point that the darkhaired girl&#39;s mood had 
degenerated to such a degree that it appeared she had closed herself off 
completely from Mireille and the outside world alike. She was scarcely 
responsive to verbal inquiries and seemed to look right through her 
surroundings most of the time, immersed in her private brooding. She 
didn&#39;t eat much anymore, either, making mealtimes a considerably short 
and cheerless affair, but coupled with the oppressive silence now 
commonplace between the two assassins, they were still uncomfortable and 
depressing despite their length. The apartment Mireille and Kirika were 
returning to at this very moment; their sanctuary, their *home*; no 
longer contained the pleasant and content atmosphere it once had. 
Rather, it was a cold and unfeeling place filled with old memories of a 
better life the two had formerly shared; a life that Mireille felt she 
had lived a long, long time ago. She wondered if that life had ever been 
real to begin with.

It couldn&#39;t go on like this. But Mireille could do nothing save for 
hunting down the false Noir, doing Breffort&#39;s bidding for both their 
sakes, and hope that everything would turn out all right in the end. 
What else was there? It was the only thing she was sure of, the only 
thing that could improve matters between her and Kirika. She just wished 
developments would proceed faster. For some reason time had become 
Mireille&#39;s third bitter foe. No, that was a lie. She knew the reason 
behind the sentiment. Mireille felt like as time went by another piece 
of Kirika&#39;s heart slipped away from her. When that feeling had hit the 
woman, it had... it had simply frightened her. And shocked her that she 
was so frightened. She knew she was attached to her partner... loved 
her... but still, a part of her had never truly believed, or perhaps 
accepted, that Kirika meant *that* much to her. Kirika. That girl. She 
always served to get under Mireille&#39;s skin somehow. Even so, the 
Corsican would rather have a moody partner she didn&#39;t quite comprehend 
her feelings for than none at all. She couldn&#39;t go back to always being 
alone.

A Metro subway entrance drew nearer on Mireille and Kirika&#39;s left as 
they walked, bright light still shining from its depths even at this 
hour. There were only a few more blocks to trek before the apartment 
would be in sight. With this chilly night air, Mireille was beginning to 
rethink her decision to walk the distance rather than take a taxicab, or 
even the Metro. She angled her gaze slightly to Kirika, speculating 
whether or not the girl felt the cold. Mireille smiled faintly without 
humour. The cold probably didn&#39;t even touch Kirika. A lack of awareness 
tended to allow one to distance themselves from petty annoyances, 
environmental and otherwise.

All of a sudden, Kirika stopped walking and looked over her shoulder, 
prompting Mireille to do likewise. A brown Citroen was cruising quietly 
up the street behind them. While that was nothing unusually in itself, 
one thing did cause the Corsican pause--its headlights were switched 
off.

Doubtless having realised he had been spotted, the driver of the car 
suddenly accelerated, speeding along the remaining length of road 
towards the stationary Mireille and Kirika, closing the distance 
separating them at an alarming rate.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille exclaimed, looking her counterpart in the eyes 
briefly before snapping her gaze to the Metro entrance, and then back 
again to the girl.

Understanding her partner&#39;s intentions, Kirika took off for the subway, 
pulling out her handgun at the same time. Mireille risked a fleeting 
look at the rapidly gaining car, and then bolted after Kirika, hot on 
the girl&#39;s heels. She heard the Citroen squeak to an abrupt halt next to 
the curb and its four doors open a second later, followed by men&#39;s 
vehement curses. Reaching inside her coat, Mireille drew her Walther P99 
from its holster strapped around her torso and angled her upper body 
back around to the car as she continued to run. She sighted five men in 
total clambering out of the Citroen, all bearing arms. With her gun held 
in her right hand, Mireille unleashed a volley of bullets in the mob&#39;s 
general direction, hoping to delay their imminent pursuit for a few 
seconds as they scrambled for cover and give her and Kirika more time to 
find a defensive position. Fighting out in the open when her opponents 
had their vehicle to hide behind was not the Corsican assassin&#39;s style.

A couple of bullets smashed through the car&#39;s front windshield, forming 
a spider&#39;s web of cracks spiralling out from the puncture holes, and 
consequently caused the driver to duck and throw himself out of the 
vehicle to prevent being hit. Several more rounds perforated the hood of 
the Citroen, and more its open doors which the majority of the men used 
to protect themselves from Mireille&#39;s inhibiting barrage. Another slug 
shattered the front passenger side window to pieces, and a second 
luckier shot struck a man trying to exit the car there in the right 
upper arm, the force of the gunshot knocking him back into his seat.

&quot;Go! Go!&quot; the injured man shouted through clenched teeth, urging his 
companions on with emphatic motions with his head while he clutched at 
his bleeding arm. &quot;Take the shotgun!&quot;

Mireille didn&#39;t stick around for the rest of the conversation, sprinting 
down the subway&#39;s flight of stairs two steps at a time as the men 
returned fire, bullets ricocheting off the walls she had only instants 
before run past. She saw Kirika disappear behind the corner at the end 
of the staircase and quickly dashed after her, leaping the remaining 
half a dozen steps to the landing, the sound of her boots hitting the 
hard cement floor echoing off the narrow subway entryway&#39;s walls.

Mireille darted around the corner just as a hail of gunfire rung out, a 
myriad of bullets riddling a payphone mounted on the wall across from 
the street entrance to the Metro system. The unfortunate payphone spewed 
out coins all over the landing from its ruptured insides, as though a 
gushing, metallic wound. Better it than her, however, Mireille thought 
grimly.

Mireille glanced at Kirika beside her as Euro coins bounced past their 
feet and down the second staircase into the Metro station. She looked 
rather anxious as she met the Corsican&#39;s eyes, one of the first true 
displays of emotion the blonde had seen for quite a while. Not 
surprising though, considering that they had just been attacked out of 
the blue. Who were these men? Or more importantly, how on earth had they 
found them? Mireille Bouquet and Kirika Yuumura were not easy people to 
track down--Kirika didn&#39;t even exist in many public and private records.

Mireille pressed her back against the cracked, graffiti stained cement 
wall and carefully peeked around the corner. Whoever these would-be 
assassins were, she was sure they weren&#39;t Soldats minions. For one 
thing, they had a substantially different dress sense than the soldiers 
of the clandestine group. These men had the trappings of showy 
gangsters, not the black suits and ties that were customary among 
Soldats operatives. Were they with Ryosuke and Vincent? It was unlikely, 
taking into account that the two Asian men were reportedly strangers to 
this country; Mireille didn&#39;t think they would have any notable contacts 
in Paris. It didn&#39;t rule out the possibility that they could have 
recruited some flunkies, however. Had one of Mireille&#39;s informants sold 
her out to the false Noir? Maybe... but the blonde had always been 
careful not to reveal too much about herself to her sources, business 
associates or not. It was a good way to wind up dead before you even 
knew what--and who--hit you.

A few rounds impacted into the wall close to Mireille&#39;s peeping face, 
causing her to reflexively jerk back into cover. In any case, her 
questions would have to wait until another, more appropriate time to be 
answered. But heads would roll as soon as she found out who had betrayed 
her.

Mireille strafed out a pace from behind the corner in a flash of 
movement, just as three of the men were advancing down the stairs, 
pistols in hand. Her expression cold, she rapidly squeezed off a trio of 
shots at the nearest gangster, all three of them surprised by her deft 
manoeuvre. Two of the Parabellum rounds made devastating contact with 
the targeted man&#39;s right thigh, buckling the whole leg underneath him 
and sending him sprawling face first on the steps, his gun escaping his 
grasp with the jolt of the fall. He cried out in pain and raised his 
head from the stairs, only to get another slug in the forehead, the 
bullet tearing clean through his skull and out the opposite side, an 
explosion of blood and brain matter punctuating its violent exit. The 
gangster&#39;s head slumped forwards against the steps once again, except 
this time lifelessly and encircled by dripping red cascading languidly 
down the stairs.

&quot;Shit! What in the hell?! You bitch!&quot; screamed one goon furiously before 
he started blazing away wildly at Mireille with his gun, obviously taken 
aback by his nearby companion&#39;s abrupt death. But all he hit was cement, 
the assassin already having retreated into the safety of the corner once 
more.

Mireille listened patiently for the telltale click of an emptied 
handgun, waiting for the gangster to foolishly waste all of his 
ammunition in his rage. No, these men were definitely not Soldats. 
Soldats people would have had more discipline. Or at the very least, 
more common sense.

Mireille heard the slide of the infuriated gangster&#39;s pistol snap back, 
and instantly she flitted out from shelter, brandishing her Walther in 
both hands. Her blue eyes suddenly widened as she was greeted by the 
alarming sight of the single barrel of a pump action shotgun aimed 
directly at her chest from behind the angry goon and his more composed 
friend, wielded by a third man who had arrived on the scene.

Mireille didn&#39;t even have the opportunity to curse before a peppering of 
pellets were fired her way, forcing her to desperately dive for cover, 
narrowly evading the lethal buckshot. Without her finely honed reflexes 
she would have taken the contents of the shotgun shell full in the 
chest, unquestionably spelling death. And Mireille would be damned if 
some low-level hoods claimed her life.

Another shotgun blast pounded into the wall Mireille and Kirika were 
just around the corner from; bits of cement raining down to the floor 
while puffs of dust were launched into the air. Perhaps it was time to 
find a better position.

Mireille signalled sharply to Kirika to run deeper into the Metro 
station with a terse flick of her head, her blonde locks waving. The 
girl immediately obeyed and the pair hurried down the second flight of 
stairs into the Metro, the steps of their chasing adversaries 
reverberating in the L-shaped entryway to their rear.

However, as soon as Mireille and Kirika entered the subway station 
proper, the blonde realised her mistake. A huge, thick iron barred gate 
was situated in front of the turnstiles to the station platform, flush 
with the walls, floor and ceiling of the entry area, effectively 
blocking any potential escape route. Stupid. Mireille should have 
remembered that the Metro was out of service for the night.

A loud pinging resounded in the station and a flare of sparks manifested 
on one bar of the gate just to the side of Mireille&#39;s head as a wayward 
bullet from the tailing gangsters missed its blonde target, spurring the 
woman to roll behind a nearby column support. Mireille flicked her head 
to the left, catching sight of Kirika swooping into the shelter of a 
pillar also, the structure thankfully just wide enough to shield a lean 
person. Terrific. Now the only means for Mireille and Kirika to shake 
these people off was to make sure that they would never bother anybody 
else ever again.

The blonde assassin sighed as yet another torrent of bullets were sent 
her and her partner&#39;s way, glancing off the upright iron bars of the 
gate and hammering into the reverse face of the pillar. She so disliked 
leaving bodies haphazardly around the place, especially in her own 
neighbourhood. It could be a messy business. One corpse was bad enough 
as it was. And the worst of it was Mireille and Kirika weren&#39;t even 
being paid to put them in their graves! Although, it could be said that 
the reward for executing these men was that she and Kirika continued 
breathing. And really, what better payment--or incentive for 
success--was that? Combating Soldats had taught Mireille that particular 
truth.

Mireille fired the little rounds remaining in her pistol over her 
shoulder at the goons, the shots mainly to force them onto the defensive 
and take the pressure off her and Kirika for a few seconds, rather than 
to actually kill any of them. The echo of gunfire faded from the station 
as the men fell back into cover, likely positioning themselves in the 
same manner Mireille and her partner did behind the station&#39;s support 
columns. They were on even terms now... aside from one detail--none of 
the gangsters had been the original Noir, the Eternal Darkness. They 
were but lambs in the company of lions.

Mireille ejected her depleted clip and retrieved a fresh one from the 
leather pouches inside her brownish-grey coat, reloading her Walther P99 
and chambering the first bullet. Bringing up her gun with both hands, 
she took a deep breath, and then released it slowly. Her eyes moved to 
Kirika--the brooding girl was in much the same stance as her. Kirika&#39;s 
eyes were closed however, reminiscent of the time when they had faced 
Ryosuke and Vincent in Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental. This was no 
occasion to be spent gazing at Kirika while trying to decipher what was 
going through her mind, however, despite whether Mireille wished to or 
not.

Bounding out from the pillar, Mireille quickly noted the new locations 
of the enemy in a blink of an eye, and glimpsed a limb sticking out from 
behind one of the columns to the far left. Seeing an opportunity, she 
fired a slug at exposed the arm, and was rewarded with an agonised howl. 
The gangster she had struck stumbled out from the protection of the 
pillar, tripping over his own feet and landing on his backside. However, 
before Mireille could finish him off, a bullet slammed into the concrete 
surface of the support adjacent to her, shot by a goon from another 
support to the right. To her dislike, she was forced to return to the 
security of her cover and consequently abandon the chance to kill a 
second member of the gangsters&#39; group.

Mireille looked to Kirika, and was pleased to see the girl move to take 
advantage of her &#39;offering&#39;. The introverted girl stepped calmly out 
from her own pillar she was using as shelter with her Beretta M1934 held 
steadily in her two dainty hands, the firearm pointing at the vulnerable 
man still sitting on the floor out in the open, his mind in a miasma of 
pain from his wound.

But she didn&#39;t fire. An icy claw suddenly gripped Mireille&#39;s heart, its 
talons biting harshly into it. Kirika simply stood there, frozen, her 
gun raised and aimed at the injured gangster, but her features slack and 
her eyes staring vacantly into space. The girl&#39;s frail body was 
completely exposed, and apparently she was oblivious to that fact too. 
What was wrong with her?! Why didn&#39;t she shoot?!

Mireille took an unconscious concerned step forward towards her 
stock-still partner, her free hand lifting to reach out to her. 
&quot;Kiri--ah!&quot; the beginnings of the woman&#39;s frantic call was viciously cut 
off as a shotgun shell smacked into the solid side of the column beside 
her and bounced off at an angle, several of the pellets grazing her 
face.

Mireille staggered backwards into cover again, clasping a hand over the 
stinging abrasions scoring her left cheek. But the minor flesh wounds 
that could have easily been a ruined mess of half-flayed features were 
the farthest things from her mind. Her gaze automatically went back to 
Kirika, her breathing and heart rate quickening substantially more than 
it had done so all throughout the gunfight. Kirika&#39;s hands--no, her 
entire arms--were shaking. Trembling uncontrollably. The Beretta in her 
grasp shuddered, and Mireille thought she could hear the full magazine 
it contained rattling.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille desperately cried, praying her voice would snap her 
partner out of whatever state of petrification she was in. Her eyes 
moved to fleetingly survey the gangsters, and to her horror, she saw 
that the man on the floor had recovered his senses and was bringing his 
pistol to bear at Kirika with his good arm, a mildly startled but 
relieved smirk on his face.

The goon armed with the shotgun grinned too a couple of feet from his 
friend, keeping his weapon on Mireille&#39;s position, ensuring that she 
wouldn&#39;t interfere unless she wanted to eat a lethal meal of buckshot. 
At this range coupled with his readiness he wouldn&#39;t miss if the 
Corsican stepped out into the open, and she was likely to lose a limb to 
the powerful blast even if he failed to score a hit on her torso. Either 
way, it would mean death.

Not that Mireille cared. Her feet rasped on the concrete floor as she 
prepared to leap out of cover and kill the pistol-wielding gangster 
before he shot Kirika, regardless if it would mean she would likely die 
in the process. In her frenetic state of mind it didn&#39;t even register 
what she was willing to do for her partner.

&quot;Dumbass kid...&quot; the goon on the floor sneered, cocking the hammer of 
his revolver as he lined up the immobile, shivering Kirika in its 
sights. His finger tensed on the trigger.

&quot;KIRIKA!&quot;

Author&#39;s ramblings:

This chapter was a little shorter than usual, but I wanted to split it 
into two parts (the reason should be obvious ^_^).

Sumiyoshi-kai and Yamaguchi-gumi are the two biggest yakuza syndicates 
in Japan if anybody didn&#39;t already realise. </pre>
