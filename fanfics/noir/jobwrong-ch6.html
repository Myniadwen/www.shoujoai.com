	The Golden Chambers, the grandest, most opulent hotel in New York 
was at peace. The lobby was sparsely populated at this late hour. The 
few patrons who deigned to remain awake so late engaged in pleasant 
activities among themselves. Unaware that silent death was approaching. 

	The main glass doors slid silently open, the blast of chilly air 
being the only indication of a new arrival. The patrons paused, even 
they, with their alcohol befuddled senses could feel the presence of 
power. Two cloaked figures walked into the hotel, the doors sliding 
closed behind them, cutting away the sound of the busy streets of New 
York. All remained still as the pair made their way to the main desk. 
The sounds of their feet striking the marble floor being the only sound 
that resonated through the now silent lobby.

	The taller of the pair reached up to her dark green hood and began 
to pull it down. Everyone froze in fear. The hood fell. A pale oval face 
greeted them, pale blue eyes ringed with fatigue over a mouth gone blue 
with the cold. Despite the author&#39;s attempts to the contrary, the 
tension seeped out of the room like water out of a leaky bucket. 

	&quot;Do you have a reservation ma&#39;am?&quot; The young man behind the desk 
asked her respectfully, opening a book so as to be ready to tick her 
off. Mireille had been dreading that question. Kirika walked off before 
Mireille could interject, heading towards the bar.

	&quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot; Mireille replied, wincing when she saw his 
expression. &quot;But I can pay a premium for any room available. It&#39;s only 
for a week.&quot; She added, hoping to sway him. The young man sat down and 
began clicking on a computer, his hands a blur. Mireille sighed and 
waited for him to finish.

	&quot;You are most lucky. We have one room left. But it is all we have. 
Unfortunately it is also the most expensive in the hotel. Which is why I 
believe it is empty.&quot; Mireille sighed, she had expected as such, but the 
boy&#39;s face told her this time it was the truth.

	&quot;The penthouse?&quot; Mireille asked, getting a nod in reply. &quot;Fine, 
how much for the week?&quot; She asked, digging into her purse for her cards, 
something told her it was going to be extortionate. She wasn&#39;t 
disappointed either.

	&quot;For the week? Seventeen thousand dollars.&quot; Years of training 
allowed her to keep a straight face, despite the cardiac arrest she was 
actually suffering from. There was an explosion between her ears as she 
smiled and handed her card over. She suspected the bank would have a 
similar reaction to hers.  &quot;Thank you ma&#39;am. The room is the penthouse 
as you know. Here&#39;s the key.&quot; He handed over the key and then handed 
back her card. Mireille thanked him and turned back, her eyes searching 
for Kirika.

	Walking over to the bar, Mireille found Kirika seated at a small 
table with two steaming mugs of tea before her. She smiled happily up at 
Mireille as she sipped on the warm drink. Mireille sat down and picked 
up her mug, enjoying the warmth that spread through her numb hands. 
Kirika smiled again before drinking some more. This was more like the 
old Kirika, Mireille thought to herself. Caring for her and making sure 
she was warm whilst Mireille handled the important stuff. 

	&quot;Do we have a room?&quot; The quiet voice asked, nothing like what she 
had been like on the plane thankfully. Maybe she had forgotten? 

	&quot;Hmm. The penthouse.&quot; Mireille replied, taking a long sip of her 
tea, the warmth seeming to spread through her bones. Rejuvenating her. 
Now all she needed was sleep. 

	&quot;Are we going then?&quot; Kirika asked, indicating their mugs which 
both had drained in record time. Mireille nodded and stood, searching 
for an elevator. Truly too tired to take the stairs. 

	A few minutes later and they were stood outside the door of their 
penthouse. The elevator had brought them up to a short corridor leading 
straight to the door. Walking up to it Mireille inserted the key and 
twisted, pushing the door open when she heard the lock click open. 

	The room was nice. Mireille noted as she walked sluggishly into 
it. Truly tired now.  In fact the room was amazing. The kitchen was to 
the left, a long marble coated bar around it. Drinks, wines and spirits 
adorned the wall nearby. A huge plasma TV was situated above a roaring 
electric fire. Their bags had been dropped off already, by the efficient 
service of the hotel. None of this Mireille saw as she headed to the 
room she hoped was the bedroom. She pushed open the door and stepped in.

	Kirika bumped into her back as she stopped suddenly. No.... no, 
no, no, no, NO! Her mind cried out in agony at the horror she saw before 
her. There was no word in all the dialects Mireille knew to express how 
pissed she was right then. It was all a joke! Some sick joke some 
bastard was playing on her, just to make her suffer.

	&quot;Why me...?&quot; She moaned to the air. She heard Kirika smother a 
giggle as she looked at the room. Oh she would, Mireille thought to 
herself. The setting was very much to Kirika&#39;s liking at the moment. 
Mireille knew she was being uncharitable, it was hardly Kirika&#39;s fault, 
but still it irritated her.

	The bed was dark red. It was shaped like a giant love heart. 
Surrounded by dark red satin curtains that could be pulled closed. The 
sheets looked flimsy like silk, and the fluffy pillows were red too. 
Each with small heart-shaped cushions by them. Even the wall.... a 
sensual pink..... the light was toned red, sending the room into a deep 
crimson. 

	Another electric fire roared at the far end, across from the bed, 
the heat reaching her already. Apart from that the room was empty. The 
cupboards for clothes obviously being elsewhere. Smiling Kirika climbed 
on the bed and thumped the mattress a bit, testing it. She seemed 
pleased with the way it bounced against her. She didn&#39;t look at 
Mireille, nor make any ... suggestions. Which was a shame because 
Mireille desperately wanted to yell at someone. 

	Snarling she went into the adjoining bathroom to get changed. She 
was too tired even to have a shower, plus she didn&#39;t want to make the 
bed wet. So she simply changed into her loose shirt and some clean 
underwear before heading back into the bedroom. Kirika had changed too 
whilst she had been gone, into her usual attire, which consisted of some 
shorts and a tank top.

	She was already laying under the covers and waiting for Mireille 
to join her. Mireille didn&#39;t think twice about it. She had been sleeping 
with Kirika for years now. It helped them to sleep and was comfortable. 
It was a necessity in France, their only having one bed anyway.

	She murmured her thanks as Kirika pulled the covers over the two 
of them, snuggling in close. Mireille closed her eyes and began to drift 
slowly away. A sharp jab in her side woke her instantly.

	&quot;Kirika, quit it.&quot; She murmured, drifting away again. Kirika tried 
again but this time got no response. Mireille ignoring her as she tried 
to get some sleep. It wasn&#39;t comfortable, but Mireille was too tired to 
care. There was a low growl from behind her but she paid it no heed. A 
hand rested on her shoulder.

	Her world turned sharply and she let out a small shocked cry as 
she fell onto her back, a gasp followed as she realised Kirika was 
straddling her, holding her hands down above her head. Their noses were 
inches apart, as were their eyes. Mireille&#39;s were wide, Kirika&#39;s clouded 
and sharp at the same time. 

	&quot;What the hell are you doing!&quot; Mireille whispered in a shocked 
voice, too shocked even to shout. She tried to free her hands only to 
find that Kirika was far stronger than her, she was trapped.

	&quot;I&#39;m collecting my dues, remember?&quot; Kirika&#39;s voice was low and 
warm caressing each syllable. Mireille swallowed as she remembered what 
Kirika was talking about. No, she wouldn&#39;t-

	She swooped down. 

	Mireille froze in shock, her body melting at the contact between 
her and Kirika. Kirika&#39;s lips were soft and warm as they pressed against 
Mireille&#39;s own. Against her own will, Mireille found her mouth moving 
with Kirika&#39;s, demanding it just as much. Kirika&#39;s hands kept her 
immobilised just as strongly as before, but this time Mireille was too 
muddled to even try and escape.

	It lasted for what felt like an eternity, Mireille laying there 
immobilised whilst Kirika pressed her lips harder against the blonde&#39;s, 
becoming more and more frantic. Mireille felt her heart begin to beat 
again as Kirika pulled away, the warm, wet contact from their lips 
leaving her. Without meaning to, Mireille licked her lips quickly. 
Simply a reaction to the feeling still on them, but it was enough to 
make Kirika smile. 

	&quot;You can&#39;t slap me.&quot; Kirika suddenly explained, her voice 
reasoning. &quot;You promised me it, so you can&#39;t hit me.&quot; Mireille scowled 
angrily, mainly to hide the confusion she was really feeling. Kirika let 
her go, quickly falling beside her and snuggling against her side to 
sleep. 

	Mireille made no move to hit her. Knowing the truth of the girl&#39;s 
words. And anyway, Kirika would probably be hurt by it, and that would 
make Mireille feel too guilty. Instead she lay there, breathing heavily 
in the night as Kirika slept, her arms wrapped around Mireille.

	That&#39;s it for now! HA, I&#39;ll leave you wondering just what Mireille 
is thinking right now as I go and write a quick one shot fanfic that has 
been haunting my dreams for a while now. I would suggest you don&#39;t read 
it. It&#39;ll be short and sad, and I&#39;ll personally hate it. It&#39;s called, 
&quot;Fleeting Dreams.&quot;
