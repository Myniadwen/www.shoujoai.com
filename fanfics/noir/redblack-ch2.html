Mireille watched the floor indicator lights illuminate gradually upwards 
as she waited for the elevator to arrive at level seventeen. The level 
where Breffort&#39;s office was located. It wasn&#39;t the first time Mireille 
had been in this elevator, riding up to Breffort&#39;s office... although 
her intent back then had been somewhat different than it was now. In 
actual fact, she had tracked down the distinguished Soldats member to 
this very building after.... Well, that was all in the past now.

Mireille had replied to the most recent of Breffort&#39;s harrying emails 
and arranged a meeting time for today in the afternoon--one day after 
the car bomb incident outside of the Aux Villes Du Nord caf&eacute;. She had 
been a little surprised when the man had emailed her back requesting 
that they convene at the same building she had once &#39;visited&#39; him at 
before. But, in retrospect, she shouldn&#39;t have been. Those of the 
society of Soldats could be expected to be awfully arrogant, especially 
those who ranked on upper most rungs of the organisation&#39;s hierarchal 
ladder--they considered themselves as the puppeteers who held and hence 
controlled the world on strings, strings that no one even realised were 
there. Despite Mireille knowing where he worked as an alleged legitimate 
and ordinary entrepreneur, Breffort hadn&#39;t moved from the commonplace 
office building the assassin had first tracked him down to. Although, it 
wasn&#39;t as if Mireille were type to blow the whistle on his other, more 
atypical activities... not unless she wanted her own secret life exposed 
in retaliation.

Oddly, in his email reply, Breffort had given no allusion of hostility 
in his words nor had he even mentioned the car bombing yesterday; not so 
much as the smallest hint of ominous subtext was contained in his 
message. It had been totally businesslike; straight and to the point. 
Mireille wasn&#39;t sure what to make of that. He had to have known the 
story going around the streets was that Noir was responsible for the 
bombing. She would have been amazed if he didn&#39;t; Soldats seemed to know 
all and see all... most of the time, anyway. Still, it wasn&#39;t like 
Breffort was the most animated person alive; regardless of the 
professional air of his message it was yet likely that he was plotting 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s deaths at this very minute. She and Kirika had 
better keep their guard up.

Mireille smiled grimly and gripped the handles of her handbag a little 
tighter in her grasp. As if their guard had been down to begin with. The 
weight of her gun hidden in the handbag carried by her side was a 
reassuring one. If a squad of armed Soldats underlings were lying in 
wait for her and Kirika to emerge from the elevator with lethal 
intentions in mind, then they would soon learn with horrendous clarity 
why the pair had once been rightfully known as Noir. But Mireille 
doubted Breffort would be foolish or desperate enough to attack them 
directly outside his own office. It simply wasn&#39;t his style. It wasn&#39;t 
Soldats&#39; style.

Mireille turned her attention away from the elevator&#39;s level indicator 
and surreptitiously shifted her eyes to Kirika, who was standing quietly 
next to her, seemingly wholly engrossed with staring at the floor. The 
diminutive girl was dressed in one of her favourite outfits consisting 
of a turquoise coloured top supported by two spaghetti straps, a short 
dark blue skirt, and finally a white parka. Kirika had lost most of the 
garments on her gruelling trek by foot to where France bordered 
Spain--the site of the Manor--but after her return to Paris with 
Mireille, the doting blonde had replaced the missing clothes on one of 
her first of countless shopping splurges for her partner. Kirika even 
had her adorable little pink shoes back... although Mireille had 
purchased a sturdy pair of black boots for the girl to wear sometimes, 
too--a professional assassin needed tough protective footwear when 
undertaking a contract. Nevertheless, Mireille liked how the pink 
slip-on shoes looked on Kirika&#39;s dainty feet. It would be all right to 
give her cute partner a bit of leeway in her choice of footwear now and 
then, especially since they weren&#39;t actively in &#39;the business&#39; anymore.

Originally, Mireille had wanted to meet with Breffort by herself. 
However, as she should have expected, Kirika would have none of it. 
Mireille had strengthened her resolve to leave Kirika behind in the 
security of their home before telling her of her wishes, but under the 
taciturn girl&#39;s quiet--yet persistent--insistence the blonde had caved. 
Mireille didn&#39;t know whether it was intentional or not, but after 
informing her that she would be going by herself, Kirika had given her a 
hurt puppy dog expression of the likes the woman&#39;s resolve had been 
utterly defenceless against. And coupled with the girl speaking the 
blonde&#39;s name and nothing else in that special way of hers, Mireille&#39;s 
resolve had crumbled to nothing--the joint offensive had simply been too 
much to endure. Besides, even if Mireille had remained steadfast and 
forbade Kirika to come with her, the exasperatingly loyal girl would 
have in all probability tailed her anyway--blatantly mind you, until 
Mireille surrendered to letting her walk beside her. Kirika would have 
followed no matter what her older partner said.

So, Mireille reasoned, it was perhaps even better that she had &#39;allowed&#39; 
Kirika to come with her. It was saving them both a lot of trouble. Yes, 
it was the truth.

Mireille&#39;s eyes became half-lidded as she directed an unnoticed dry look 
at Kirika, the girl standing with her hands in her parka&#39;s pockets, 
appearing as demure and innocent as ever. The Corsican let out a small 
sigh, her steely blue eyes losing their sardonic quality, turning a 
gentler shade. She was becoming a real softy... at least when it came to 
Kirika. She prayed that she hadn&#39;t made a dreadful mistake in letting 
her partner tag along with her, though. The threat of violence was 
always there when they left the safety of their apartment, but now, 
inside a building that belonged to Soldats, the threat had doubled--no, 
tripled. Mireille would make sure the meeting with Breffort finished 
quickly. The faster things were straightened out with him, the faster 
she and Kirika could return to their peaceful life... if it was still 
waiting for them. Mireille wouldn&#39;t give Breffort a chance to coerce 
them into a Soldats&#39; machination or worse, into the powerful group&#39;s 
fold. Breffort had offered her an influential place in the society once 
before; there was no reason why he or the other high ranking officials 
of Soldats might not still harbour the desire to recruit her.

The noise of the elevator doors sliding open brought Mireille out of her 
thoughts, and with Kirika in tandem, she stepped out of the elevator and 
into the adjoining hallway, before proceeding in the direction of 
Breffort&#39;s office.

As Mireille and Kirika walked into the foyer of Breffort&#39;s office, two 
men dressed in grey suits relaxing on one of three black leather couches 
positioned around a coffee table inside perked up and turned their heads 
towards them. Mireille tensed slightly as they regarded her but closed 
the double doors she and Kirika had entered through behind her without 
hesitation before continuing to walk further into the room, outwardly 
appearing calm and cool, but inwardly a coiled spring ready to strike at 
a moment&#39;s notice. She had shot and killed the last two guards that had 
been stationed here during her first visit to the foyer; she wondered if 
their replacements knew that. But considering the mistrustful and cagey 
way the duo eyed her and Kirika, Mireille wouldn&#39;t be startled if they 
did. She wondered if the sentries also knew that she and her colleague 
were futhermore the Noir of ancient legend, or had been for a time at 
any rate. Perhaps that was the cause of their obvious apprehension... 
but it was doubtful. Mireille really didn&#39;t believe that the higher-ups 
of Soldats would reveal the genuine Noir&#39;s true identity to their lowly 
subordinates. They simply didn&#39;t need to know. And knowledge was power, 
with those top officials not apt to share either.

&quot;He&#39;s expecting you,&quot; one of the men said, gesturing with a tilt of his 
head to a set of double doors over his shoulder, while not taking his 
eyes off Mireille or Kirika. In the meantime his companion sat stock 
still beside him, staring at the young women with a steady gaze that 
roamed periodically between the pair.

Mireille smiled thinly in response. The guards hadn&#39;t even so much as 
stirred from their seats to check them for weapons. Maybe her and 
Kirika&#39;s reputation as Noir had preceded them after all. Or it could be 
that the guards were just always edgy with everyone who crossed their 
paths; that attitude did make for a longer life in their line of work. 
Maybe they were in actual fact under direct orders from Breffort not to 
frisk Mireille and Kirika for arms. In any case Mireille was glad; she 
had never liked being felt up by strange men with wandering hands under 
the pretext of searching for concealed weapons. Although it rarely 
occurred--as a professional assassin Mireille typically avoided 
situations where suspicion could be laid on her, and that included 
walking into places where a physical pat down of her person was 
required.

Strolling unhurriedly past the chary-eyed sentries--whose gazes stuck to 
them like glue as they moved--Mireille and Kirika approached Breffort&#39;s 
doors, and, after a short forewarning knock courtesy of the Corsican, 
walked into the Soldats member&#39;s office.

Breffort looked up from where he was seated at his desk as Mireille and 
Kirika came into the room, putting down the fountain pen he had 
previously been writing with. Remy Breffort was a somewhat aged man, 
perhaps in his late fifties, with slicked back grey hair and attired in 
an expensive-looking charcoal grey suit of fine material and cut, 
painting an overall dapper exterior. Mireille hypothesised that he was a 
prominent individual in Soldats&#39; echelons, perhaps even sitting on the 
chief council itself, if one existed. All the more reason to stay sharp 
and leave quickly. While the blonde had had dealings with Breffort in 
the past, it didn&#39;t mean she trusted him more than any other Soldats 
follower.

&quot;Mireille Bouquet,&quot; Breffort greeted flatly in his rather gruff voice, 
speaking French. He cast his eyes to Kirika trailing at the rear of 
Mireille for a second, but then they returned to the woman. &quot;I am 
pleased you have answered my summons. Come in. Sit down.&quot;

Mireille advanced into the richly decorated room with long, purposeful 
strides, before halting abruptly in front of two plush sofas facing a 
polished cherry wood coffee table. &quot;That won&#39;t be necessary,&quot; she 
declared tersely as Kirika softly clicked shut the office&#39;s double 
doors, then positioned herself a couple of steps behind her partner. 
&quot;The only reason I-- *we*--&quot; Mireille quickly corrected, &quot;--are here is 
to assure you--and Soldats--that we were not responsible for killing 
your people.&quot; Mireille narrowed her eyes, clutching her handbag in front 
of her tightly with both hands. &quot;Although I&#39;ll admit your constant 
messages did try my patience....&quot; she added hotly under her breath. 
&quot;While the word may be that Noir is taking the blame for the car bombing 
outside the Aux Villes Du Nord caf&eacute;, it was not we.&quot; The woman then 
smirked faintly, but the smile held more ice than warmth. &quot;We prefer 
more... shall we say, elegant methods of disposing of people.&quot; Mireille 
glanced over her shoulder at Kirika, her smile now turning fond, just 
for the cute girl. &quot;Well, one of us does,&quot; she amended rather teasingly, 
recalling her stoic partner&#39;s brutal yet effective techniques at ending 
lives.

Kirika, exhibiting her aforementioned stoicism, didn&#39;t react to the jibe 
bar an infinitesimal movement of her lips.

Breffort simply looked at Mireille levelly for several moments. Then, 
after heaving a weary sigh, he stood up from his chair and hobbled out 
from behind his desk, leaning the majority of his weight on his peculiar 
cane topped with what loosely resembled a golden hawk&#39;s head. &quot;Noir...&quot; 
he mumbled to himself, looking away from Mireille and Kirika. &quot;I had 
hoped it was merely a rumour, but now....&quot; Breffort sighed once again 
and shook his head slightly, before returning his attention to Mireille. 
&quot;The situation has become even worse than I had first believed. It would 
be wise if you and your partner listen to what I have to say,&quot; he 
recommended with some resignation.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Mireille said coldly and with barely veiled enmity 
beneath her words, no smiles of any sort now. &quot;We don&#39;t want to know 
what the &#39;situation&#39; is.&quot; There was no way she was going to let Breffort 
get them involved in whatever was going on. Mireille had already 
informed the man that neither she nor Kirika were accountable for the 
deaths of the two Soldats agents--their business with him was finished. 
Mireille and Kirika could go back to their quiet life oblivious to 
whatever Breffort&#39;s and Soldats&#39; problems were, and be happier for it. 
&quot;We&#39;re done here,&quot; the Corsican assassin stated firmly, turning to go.

&quot;If the title of Noir is truly being used then this concerns you too,&quot; 
Breffort said to Mireille&#39;s retreating back. &quot;You *and* your partner,&quot; 
he continued in a softer tone, someway knowing how the inclusion of 
Kirika would affect the woman&#39;s mindset. &quot;It is the reason why I&#39;ve been 
trying to contact you of late.&quot;

Mireille stopped dead in her tracks when her partner was mentioned. 
Curse Breffort! She wondered irritably if he had agents spying on how 
she and Kirika interacted with each other now. Although, Breffort had 
been present when Mireille and Kirika had walked out of the Manor 
together, the sole survivors of a battle against Altena and her enclave. 
Perhaps the woman&#39;s decision to follow after and in turn save Kirika 
then had been enough for him to go on.

Mireille turned back and looked at Kirika, who hadn&#39;t moved. The girl 
met her gaze wordlessly and then, to the blonde&#39;s dismay, she walked 
slowly over to one of the sofas. &quot;Kirika...&quot; Mireille whispered in 
consternation and surprise.

With Kirika&#39;s choice made, there was little Mireille could do but 
staunchly stand by her, regardless of how much she wished the withdrawn 
girl had followed her lead like she normally did. As Kirika took a seat 
on the sofa, Mireille reluctantly did likewise, sitting primly next to 
her colleague and laying her handbag on her lap. She did her best not to 
slouch despondently. Her and Kirika&#39;s peaceful way of life was giving 
its final death rattle.

Breffort took a brief moment to fetch a manila folder out from one of 
his desk drawers, and then limped over to the other, vacant, sofa across 
from Mireille and Kirika before seating himself in it, releasing a tired 
breath of air. He propped his cane against one of the sofa&#39;s arms and 
then opened the dossier in his hands.

&quot;We believe,&quot; Breffort began, and Mireille had no doubt in her mind who 
exactly &#39;we&#39; was referring to, &quot;that this man, Ryosuke Ishinomori, is 
one of those responsible for the act of aggression against us 
yesterday.&quot; Breffort laid out a number of photographs he had retrieved 
from the folder on the table in front of Mireille and Kirika, placing 
them down one after the other, side by side in a neat row.

Mireille leaned forwards on the sofa, peering at the mix of colour and 
black and white photos of assorted sizes, before picking one up and 
examining it, her interest piqued despite herself. Clearly surveillance 
specialists--who were highly likely to also be members of Soldats--had 
taken them. The colour picture in Mireille&#39;s hands was of an Asian man 
who looked to be in his mid twenties, standing a couple of feet from a 
black limousine and seemingly occupied with someone or something outside 
of the snapshot, and consequently was apparently oblivious to being 
spied upon and photographed. Ryosuke Ishinomori was a tall individual, 
at least six foot if the limousine in the background was any measure, 
and possessed a slim build. Then again, Mireille couldn&#39;t be certain of 
that since he wore a long coat of the darkest black. It was buckled from 
his neck to his waist with gunmetal grey clasps and fell in two tails to 
the tops of his ankles, and as a result, hid most of his similarly 
gloomily attired body from view. The coat had a faint sheen to it that 
was visible even in the photo, like it was made of some sort of glossy 
substance, perhaps leather. Its collar was cut straight and stood up 
stiffly to Ishinomori&#39;s mouth, partially obscuring his features. But 
Mireille could make out enough. Ishinomori would have been rather 
handsome if his face hadn&#39;t been gaunt and his expression stony. Dark 
circles ringed his lifeless violet, almost purple, eyes, made doubly 
more noticeable by his deathly pale complexion. Stark white hair hung to 
his shoulders, but fanned out in a series of spikes away from his head 
just before actually touching them.

All in all the general air of Ryosuke Ishinomori, even from a mere 
photograph alone, touted that he was a very dangerous and cold 
individual... but not of the type that Mireille hadn&#39;t dealt with 
before. There were many people who held themselves in such repute in the 
criminal world--and those in the average world too, for that 
matter--arrogant men and women who felt themselves superior to others 
and acted accordingly. Fools who thought of themselves above their 
customarily meagre castes. Mireille had encountered their like many, 
many times. They were often the ones who begged for their lives before 
she ended them. She would have to encounter Ishinomori in person before 
she could determine if he shared those other wannabes&#39; characteristics, 
or if he actually had the ability to back up his aplomb.

As Mireille was studying the picture, a flash of memory manifested in 
her mind&#39;s eye, a memory from the day before. She inhaled sharply and 
frowned hard at the man in the photo. Shoulder length stark white hair 
and a long jet-black coat.... It was the man she had bumped into on the 
street outside the caf&eacute; yesterday, right before the Soldats sedan was 
turned into a hunk of flaming scrap metal. Mireille should have 
recognised him sooner. He must have been there to trigger the car bomb 
remotely himself. How very brazen, she thought disdainfully.

Mireille spared a glance at Kirika to her left, and saw the girl 
impassively scrutinising another photograph of Ishinomori, this 
particular one of him sitting at a bar in a restaurant, dressed much 
like he had been in the picture she had been looking at and with the 
same emotionless countenance. The shop signs caught in the foreground of 
the black and white photo were written in what looked like Japanese 
characters--it must have been shot in Japan. Well, Ryosuke Ishinomori 
did appear to hail from the country.

Kirika&#39;s eyes turned to meet Mireille&#39;s for a moment at the woman&#39;s 
look, but then Breffort started talking again, demanding both her and 
her partner&#39;s full attention.

&quot;Ishinomori was spotted recently in Paris accompanied by his usual 
associate, one Wen-Sung Hsu; a man also known as Vincent Hsu,&quot; Breffort 
revealed, placing another set of snapshots on the coffee table, under 
the first collection.

Mireille and Kirika moved at the same time, each reaching for a 
surveillance photograph of the second bombing suspect. At first glance 
Mireille thought that Breffort had been mistaken about Hsu&#39;s gender, but 
after closer inspection she realised he was simply a remarkably 
beautiful man. Truly Vincent Hsu could have been mistaken for a woman. 
If Mireille were so inclined that way she might have even been attracted 
to him. But as it was, she preferred the authentic thing. She could 
accept no substitutes, regardless of how feminine a man appeared.

With a medium-to-small build and long lustrous black hair, Hsu was the 
exact opposite of his older-looking partner Ishinomori, even more so 
with the broad smile plastered on his almost flawless face; the solitary 
blemish a mole by the right side of his mouth. The picture Mireille had 
chosen was in full colour displaying Hsu carousing in what looked to be 
a seedy nightclub somewhere, with his arms around two pretty yet 
whorishly dressed women who the Corsican could practically visualise 
simpering. The enchanting man who had won their affections--and seemed 
to certainly be enjoying them--was clad in a black suit and tie along 
with a correspondingly coloured shirt, matching his Japanese associate&#39;s 
fashion sense. However, Hsu wore his clothing well, holding himself in a 
suave but laid-back manner that shone through even the static photo in 
Mireille&#39;s hand. His eyes were pools of enrapturing liquid amber, 
captivating in their soft exquisiteness, while his ebony locks were tied 
loosely in a ponytail at the nape of his neck and hung over one 
shoulder, reaching his waist. A series of short strips made of a black 
velvet-like material were wrapped around Hsu&#39;s ponytail, keeping the 
long tresses neatly together, and a few centimetres from the tail&#39;s 
bottom a dark cord was tied, producing a tuft of hair at the ponytail&#39;s 
end. It was hard to imagine a person with such a jovial and captivating 
look was paired with the likes of the dour Ryosuke Ishinomori. But then 
appearances could all too easily be deceiving. Mireille doubted the 
casual observer would think Kirika was anything more than an average 
girl by merely looking at her.

&quot;Both men have become significantly prominent players in the 
Asia-Pacific region, rising from relative obscurity from small 
gang-related syndicates,&quot; Breffort went on while Mireille and her 
darkhaired companion studied the snapshots. &quot;Perhaps you have heard of 
them...?&quot; he posed to the well-known and respected Corsican assassin.

&quot;I don&#39;t visit that area of the world often,&quot; Mireille replied in an 
absent mumble, her interest focused primarily on the picture of Hsu. 
&quot;Europe is my traditional playground.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Breffort said somewhat contritely, before clearing his 
throat and resuming his report. &quot;Alone, Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent 
Hsu make equally formidable foes,&quot; he said, impassively watching 
Mireille and Kirika continue to look over the photos of the duo. &quot;But 
together....&quot; The grey-haired man directed an unwavering gaze at 
Mireille, the woman having looked up at his noticeable pause. &quot;Together, 
they are arguably worthy of Noir&#39;s heritage.&quot;

Mireille answered Breffort&#39;s gaze with a dispassionate and level look, 
clearly unimpressed and unafraid.

She then exhaled with exaggerated heaviness, and belligerently tossed 
the photograph she had been examining back onto the coffee table&#39;s shiny 
surface, her patience at its end. &quot;This is all *very* interesting,&quot; she 
said sarcastically, &quot;but will there be a point to any of this soon? All 
you&#39;ve shown us is two *supposedly* dangerous men who killed two of your 
Soldats lapdogs. I don&#39;t see what they have to do with myself or Kirika 
beyond their use of the name, Noir.&quot;

Breffort was silent for a moment, during which Mireille was tempted to 
take Kirika and leave already, but then the Soldats official spoke once 
again.

&quot;When I learned Ishinomori and Hsu had appeared in Paris, I immediately 
assigned two agents to keep watch over their activities, the same men 
who I used as convenient one-time couriers to deliver my message to 
you.&quot;

Mireille raised a single elegant blonde eyebrow at this.

Seeing the woman&#39;s questioning expression, Breffort explained. &quot;It is a 
rarity when they leave the Eastern hemisphere. Especially with... 
circumstances as they are over there at present.&quot; Noticing Mireille&#39;s 
now even greater quizzical look, Breffort held up at hand, forestalling 
any inquiries. &quot;I&#39;ll explain in due time. It was pure coincidence that 
my message was delivered to you at the precise time Ishinomori and Hsu 
decided to take the opportunity to dispose of my men.&quot; His eyes moved to 
Kirika for a fraction of a second, who was still absorbed with looking 
at photos, and then went back to Mireille. &quot;I hope neither of you were 
injured in the ensuing blast.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Mireille said dryly, recalling her painful flight through the 
caf&eacute;&#39;s glass door. &quot;Although your concern is touching,&quot; she couldn&#39;t 
help adding condescendingly.

Undeterred by the blonde&#39;s tone, Breffort continued, albeit with a 
slight, almost inaudible sigh beforehand. &quot;I don&#39;t know how they 
discovered they were being observed by Soldats--my agents must have 
become careless--but it&#39;s moot now. Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu 
are only the hands of a larger menace. The real threat is this woman--&quot; 
Breffort laid a newspaper clipping on top of the several pictures on the 
table. &quot;--Kaede Ishinomori, Ryosuke&#39;s younger sister. He and Hsu are 
merely her operatives. *She* is the true danger.&quot;

Mireille sighed in annoyance and picked up the newspaper clipping. 
Written in Japanese, the article was obviously taken from a Japanese 
publication. The accompanying colour picture for the report was focused 
on a young woman dressed in a sensible yet stylish black pantsuit, 
shirt, and tie combination, outside of what resembled a courthouse. She 
was surrounded by a flood of people, most of them journalist types. An 
escort consisting of five women and two men stood out in the crowd, 
however, appearing to be with the young woman--who was evidently Kaede 
Ishinomori--most likely her bodyguards and lawyers. Mireille wasn&#39;t sure 
what the report was about--she could speak Japanese well, but reading it 
was a different matter entirely--but it was clear even to her that Kaede 
Ishinomori was in some trouble with the law; trouble big enough to 
warrant media coverage.

Kaede shared some resemblance to her brother, beyond their affinity for 
the colour black. While definitely not as tall as him, she did have the 
same coloured hair and complexion and slender frame. Her snow white hair 
was cut quite short and tapered to the nape of her neck, and a multitude 
of bangs hung over her eyes, utterly concealing them from view. Mireille 
wondered how the woman walked around without knocking into things. While 
her hair obscured a good deal of her features, what the assassin could 
see showed her that Kaede was an attractive woman. A ghost of a smile 
was affixed to Kaede&#39;s face; a smug and rather alluring smile, like she 
knew something very special and important that everyone else did not. 
Mireille had a feeling that smile could turn into a cold and sinister 
rictus in a heartbeat.

&quot;She&#39;s being accused of drug trafficking and possession with intent to 
sell,&quot; Kirika said softly to Mireille in Japanese, having scooted close 
to her partner to read the news article also. &quot;It says that the key 
witness is still missing after his disappearance from protective custody 
shortly after her arraignment.&quot;

Mireille nodded and made a sound of understanding, peering at the 
newspaper clipping even more closely, as if by now knowing what it said 
made the Japanese characters become suddenly decipherable to her.

&quot;That is correct,&quot; Breffort said, overhearing and understanding Kirika&#39;s 
helpful translation, even though it wasn&#39;t spoken in French. Mireille 
found herself disliking him just a little bit more. &quot;Kaede Ishinomori is 
the CEO and majority shareholder of Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals, a drug 
research, development, and manufacturing company based predominantly in 
Asia, but with many other subsidiaries throughout the world. In the past 
it was a legitimate business, but now it is essentially a front for the 
production and shipment of illegal substances--including narcotics and 
the rare chemical weapon. She inherited it--and many other assets--from 
her mother after she passed away during an altercation with some 
unforgiving and impetuous &#39;business rivals&#39;.&quot; Breffort paused for a 
second, causing Mireille and Kirika to look up from the news article. 
&quot;Hikaru Ishinomori was Soldats, and a sympathiser with Altena&#39;s beliefs; 
she held a prominent place in Altena&#39;s splinter group. She was killed 
before Le Grand Retour was brought to fruition, however.&quot;

&quot;Soldats. Why am I not surprised,&quot; Mireille sneered, dropping the 
newspaper clipping on the coffee table in front of her. &quot;That would make 
Kaede Ishinomori and all of her associates Soldats members too, 
correct?&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Breffort confirmed, before noticeably hesitating. &quot;But...&quot; he 
went on, a little reluctantly, &quot;Kaede Ishinomori is not like her mother. 
Hikaru Ishinomori may have shared Altena&#39;s views, but she was Soldats 
through and through. But her daughter... her daughter thinks 
differently. She is too ambitious; she does not follow the dictates of 
Soldats. She expands the Ishinomori Empire too recklessly and impudently 
uses her ties to the society, cowing criminal and lawful organisations 
alike with our age-old name. She threatens to expose us with her 
carelessness. This is... unacceptable.&quot;

Mireille smirked. So that was the reason Breffort had had agents on 
Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu. Now they were finally getting 
somewhere. It seemed that a loose cannon as it were, one with sizable 
strength and, if that wasn&#39;t enough, links to Altena, had emerged in 
Soldats; which was making the high-ranking old men of the clandestine 
group nervous. And perhaps rightfully so. Soldats did their work from 
the shadows; they always had. To be revealed from those shadows, bare to 
the world....

Mireille&#39;s smirk grew. It must be a very daunting notion to Breffort and 
his little friends. She was suddenly rather pleased she had stayed to 
hear what he&#39;d had to say.

&quot;Go on...&quot; Mireille prompted a little smugly, although she did try to 
keep her voice even. She rested back in the sofa and crossed her legs, 
feeling a great deal more relaxed now.

Breffort merely stared at the composed blonde woman for a moment, but 
under her unrelenting conceited smile and level gaze, sighed softly and 
then quickly yielded, telling all.

&quot;I have been charged by the High Council of Soldats with the task of 
handling this... problem. Discreetly, however. To openly oppose any 
major force belonging to Soldats is just not done; it would lead to 
disastrous results. It is the same reason why we did not simply quash 
Altena&#39;s faction with our own forces at the very beginning she made her 
intentions of initiating Le Grand Retour clear. There would have been 
open war in the streets; men and women of Soldats with their own cells 
and unique, often conflicting beliefs are spread everywhere, all over 
the globe. Exposure would have been all but unavoidable.&quot;

Breffort sighed once more and shook his head a fraction, looking away 
from Mireille. &quot;But so far my efforts have all been for naught--I am 
simply sending Soldats men to their deaths. Ryosuke Ishinomori... 
Vincent Hsu... they are Kaede Ishinomori&#39;s &#39;Black Hands&#39;; they are truly 
impressive combatants. Indeed, if the two are really using the name of 
Noir....&quot; Breffort turned his head back to Mireille, the depths of his 
eyes looking somewhat strained. &quot;I believe Kaede knows that the majority 
of Soldats is in opposition to her, but she also knows Soldats won&#39;t 
make a direct move against her either. And so we do a dance. I attack 
covertly with small surgical strikes, and she retaliates with--while not 
quite equal--judiciousness. And thus, it goes on until one of us 
missteps.&quot; Breffort reached up and smoothed back his grey hair with one 
hand. &quot;It is a tiring ballet,&quot; he admitted wearily.

&quot;Why not just wait for her trial?&quot; Mireille asked a bit absently, 
gesturing with a crook of her finger towards the newspaper clipping on 
the coffee table. &quot;She may be convicted; it would solve everything quite 
nicely. Cut off a snake&#39;s head, and normally the remaining body dies in 
time.&quot;

&quot;Do you not think Kaede has not already assured that she will be 
acquitted on all charges?&quot; Breffort said, a hint of an edge in his 
voice. &quot;She has already utilised her two Hands to make the only damning 
witness against her disappear from the public eye. He was one of her own 
circle, I believe. He will not pass from this life easy... or slowly.&quot;

&quot;Well then, it looks like you&#39;re in a bit of a quandary,&quot; Mireille said, 
paying no heed to the Soldats man&#39;s slightly hard tone. &quot;However, the 
way I see it, Kaede and her &#39;Hands&#39; are your problem. Not ours.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Do you really believe that?&quot; Breffort said in his usual monotone. 
&quot;When I learned that Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu were possibly 
aspiring to become Noir, I thought it shrewd to contact you. To me, it 
is clear that Kaede has learned of Soldats legendary Black Hands and has 
modelled her two top killers in Noir&#39;s image--or at least, is attempting 
too. How long do you think it will take her to discover that the true 
Noir is living here in Paris, alive and well? What do you think she--&quot;

Breffort&#39;s words were cut off as Mireille abruptly stood up, her face 
twisted into an expression of loathing. Kirika looked up at her from 
where she still sat, her countenance unreadable.

&quot;We are *not* Noir,&quot; Mireille declared angrily, all her prior mild 
amusement now vanished from her voice and features. &quot;Perhaps we were 
once, but no longer. We are not part of Soldats--we never will be. We 
are outsiders in your little... power struggle. The unruly child in your 
organisation is your own to curb. *Alone*&quot; The assassin turned sharply 
to Kirika, motioning for her to rise with a flick of her hand. &quot;Come on, 
Kirika,&quot; she snapped, &quot;we&#39;re leaving.&quot;

Breffort was trying to suck them into a Soldats plot as Mireille had 
previously suspected, although his attempt had been carried out in a 
subtle way; not until the end had he revealed the true purpose of this 
meeting. But it was crystal clear now what the real reasons behind it 
and his messages were. Breffort wanted to recruit Mireille and Kirika to 
help him deal with a rogue Soldats member who had delusions of grandeur. 
He wanted to recruit them into Soldats employ. Never. Mireille would 
never let that happen.

Mireille took two steps towards the doors of the office, but when she 
didn&#39;t hear her partner&#39;s footsteps following her, she turned irritably 
back to find the girl still on the sofa. &quot;Kirika!&quot; she chastised 
strictly, causing her introverted colleague to instantly leap up from 
her seat and trot over to her.

As Mireille, with Kirika now a step behind her, proceeded towards the 
doors once again, Breffort unwelcomely strived a final time to compel 
the woman to rally to his cause. &quot;You can&#39;t remain passive in this,&quot; he 
said to Mireille&#39;s back, making the blonde slow her pace in spite of 
herself. &quot;Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu are here, in Paris, when by 
all rights they should be near Kaede, especially with her trial date 
coming up in less than two weeks. It is strange she has sent them 
here....&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Mireille said bitingly without turning, her hand 
on one of office&#39;s door handles, on the verge of leaving. Of escaping.

&quot;There can be only one true Noir,&quot; Breffort said from the sofa, the 
words freezing the Corsican&#39;s heart. &quot;You know this. While the motives 
for Ishinomori and Hsu&#39;s appearance in Paris are unknown to me, there is 
considerable likelihood it is to locate you... and your partner....&quot; He 
paused for effect, but Mireille remained silent. &quot;You claim that you and 
your partner are not Noir, but that won&#39;t matter to her. Or to them. 
Kaede Ishinomori seems to want her own version of Noir, which means her 
sights are set on you. You and your partner will be hunted, if you both 
aren&#39;t being already. You can either wait until Ishinomori and Hsu find 
you in another caf&eacute;, or you can find them first. In the end, it is still 
your own choice to make.&quot;

Mireille lowered her head, the weight of Breffort&#39;s words resting 
heavily on her slim shoulders. Could she go back to her quiet life with 
Kirika, now knowing that it could be destroyed at any moment? But that 
had always been a peril Mireille was aware of. Except now it would be 
like sticking her head in the sand, waiting for a nightmare to raze 
their dream of a peaceful existence. A nightmare she knew would sooner 
or later rear its head. The question was, did she wait for the nightmare 
to come to her and Kirika? Or did she charge ahead, down the black path, 
and confront it directly? Either way, her and her partner&#39;s quiet life 
would come to an end.

Mireille looked at Kirika. She looked back at her, her face typically 
impassive. The blonde wondered what she wanted to do. Kirika had to have 
known that this day would come eventually. Mireille&#39;s shoulders slumped 
and her expression fell. She had accepted that she would inevitably 
travel the black path once again, but Kirika....

&quot;Alright,&quot; Mireille conceded, her voice containing a measure of 
hoarseness. &quot;You&#39;ve convinced me.&quot; She turned back around to Breffort. 
As she had anticipated, his face held no trace of triumph at his 
victory. He wasn&#39;t the type to gloat. &quot;I expect you&#39;ll be providing us 
with Soldats aid?&quot; At least she and Kirika wouldn&#39;t have to handle 
Ryosuke and Vincent alone. Two people who would knowingly attack Soldats 
agents in spite of the repercussions it would entail, and do it by 
themselves with no backup, were two people who were definitely 
exceedingly formidable. Or exceedingly daring. Regardless, any help 
Breffort could give would be most welcome in Mireille&#39;s opinion. Of 
course, Ryosuke and Vincent weren&#39;t the only two people in the world who 
had willingly attacked and killed Soldats agents....

&quot;Unfortunately, my assistance will be limited,&quot; Breffort said, eliciting 
a scowl from Mireille. She should have predicted as much. &quot;You said it 
yourself; you and your partner are not part of Soldats. There are many 
High Council members who see you as an enemy of Soldats, albeit a 
sleeping one. If they even found out about this meeting the 
ramifications for myself would be fatal. No, I&#39;m afraid you will be 
largely on your own.&quot;

&quot;Then what &#39;limited assistance&#39; can you provide?&quot; Mireille said 
contemptuously.

Breffort held up the manila folder in his hand. Terrific.

&quot;Information mainly,&quot; he clarified. &quot;But perhaps more than that in the 
future. Although I will have to be careful.&quot;

Mireille sighed deeply. So this was it. The black path was calling her 
name... and Kirika&#39;s as well. She couldn&#39;t help but feel it would be 
even more difficult to veer away from it this time around. Darkness had 
caught them once again in its grasp, and it was a force that wasn&#39;t apt 
to let anybody go when they wanted to. *If* they wanted to.

With the weight inside her handbag more noticeable than ever, Mireille 
walked slowly back to Breffort and reached out to take the folder from 
his grasp. She had made her choice. The quicker they disposed of Ryosuke 
and Vincent, the better chance she and Kirika had of freeing themselves 
from the course of the black path of murder... a course that always 
ended in death for its travellers. With Kaede&#39;s &#39;Noir&#39; dead, Mireille 
and Kirika would be released from her and Breffort&#39;s intrigues... 
presumably. At any rate, it was the wisest approach for the moment.

As Mireille took a hold of the folder, she met Breffort&#39;s greyish eyes 
with her own blue ones. She knew not to entirely trust the man. He was 
Soldats. Even if their objectives were the same, as they had been during 
their previous dealings concerning Altena, it wasn&#39;t like they were 
friends. They were more like business partners, if anything. Mireille 
reminded herself once again to stay on guard... particularly against 
Breffort.

&quot;And so the sleeping lions awaken....&quot; Breffort whispered softly as he 
let go of the folder.

******

Kirika Yuumura followed Mireille into their apartment and quietly shut 
the door behind them, before securely locking its deadbolt. The trip 
back home had been made in silence, not a single word exchanged between 
either of them. While once, in the past, that in itself would not have 
been out of the ordinary, these days Mireille was considerably more 
talkative, frequently chatting to Kirika about a wide variety of topics 
that happened to take her fancy at the time. For the most part Kirika 
merely listened to the woman, only providing her own input when 
required--she was not much for talking. But she enjoyed simply listening 
to Mireille&#39;s opinions on things, and also the sound of her pleasant, 
articulate voice. It was comforting to Kirika. When Mireille spoke often 
and contentedly, it made Kirika feel that everything was okay in the 
world, and that her partner was at ease. It put her at ease too.

But now it was like it had all reverted back to several months earlier, 
when silence was Kirika and Mireille&#39;s constant companion. Kirika&#39;s 
silence was of course nothing new, but when Mireille was quiet it 
characteristically meant she was thinking hard about something... or was 
worried about something. More likely worried in this case. But not 
nervous, no, Mireille never became nervous no matter what peril or trial 
she was up against... with a few exceptions. She did get nervous around 
Kirika herself on occasion. The darkhaired girl seemed to easily fluster 
Mireille for some reason.

Kirika rested back against a wall in the living room and gazed up at the 
ceiling as Mireille walked over to the billiard table, depositing on it 
the manila dossier containing the information on their new enemies, 
along with her handbag, which landed with a dull clunk. Kirika knew what 
Mireille was worried about. She knew what the latest developments meant.

Kirika&#39;s eyelids drooped a little, her reddish-brown eyes becoming sad. 
Their peaceful time together seemed so short, now. Kirika had become 
accustomed to simply living each day of her life as it came with 
Mireille. It had been like she was a normal girl and that her previous 
life as an assassin had happened to someone else--just a bad, distant 
memory; a dream. Or rather a nightmare. Truly, she had almost forgotten. 
Almost.

But soon Kirika and Mireille would be fighting once again. Soon their 
lives would be filled with violence, with bloodshed, with murder... with 
sins. They would be filled with danger too, and their very lives would 
be put at risk, but Kirika had never feared for her own personal safety. 
She rarely felt the emotion, fear. Except when it concerned her older 
partner. Mireille&#39;s personal safety was a whole other story. Kirika 
always worried about the woman&#39;s wellbeing; she had done so nearly ever 
since they first met. Mireille was a very capable assassin, but that 
didn&#39;t make her invulnerable. And now that they were heading back into a 
life of killing, and would be pitched against two purportedly skilled 
rivals, Kirika&#39;s fear for Mireille had increased tenfold. If the 
unimaginable were to occur, if Mireille were to somehow leave her... 
Kirika didn&#39;t think she would survive for long afterwards.

Mireille was literally everything to Kirika--she was utterly vital to 
the girl&#39;s continued existence and happiness. The woman was the only 
person she really knew, her only friend, her only family. Kirika felt 
something for Mireille she had experienced with no other person before. 
She felt love; it was the only word she knew that could possibly 
describe the feeling. Kirika loved Mireille deeply, with absolutely 
everything she was. She had for a long time. And Mireille felt the same 
way; the girl knew it to be true. Mireille may not be very forthcoming 
about her feelings, but Kirika was certain she did. Kirika could clearly 
see the changes in her partner&#39;s behaviour towards her. She only wished 
Mireille would be more open about her love. Kirika didn&#39;t really know 
much about how people who loved each other acted, but she knew enough to 
realise Mireille held herself back somewhat. She wasn&#39;t sure why the 
blonde did. But for the moment, it didn&#39;t really matter that much to 
Kirika. Just being with Mireille virtually every hour of every day was 
more than enough for her to be content.

At the bottom of her field of vision Kirika could make out Mireille 
looking at her rather absorbedly while leaning against the side of the 
billiard table with one hand. Kirika could tell she was internally 
debating with herself about something. She knew Mireille thought she 
wouldn&#39;t notice her pensive expression, what with the girl&#39;s attention 
seemingly riveted to the ceiling. But Kirika noticed almost everything 
when it concerned Mireille, even if her partner tried to hide things 
from her. She never brought it up of course, not unless it was really 
important. Mireille would probably deny it anyway, and then she would 
become uncomfortable around Kirika... more so. For example, the 
perceptive girl knew they were still getting contract offers from across 
most of Europe, sent via email, for weeks now. Mireille quickly closed 
the email program whenever she made her presence known, and then 
afterwards behaved a little guiltily. But Kirika wasn&#39;t stupid or blind. 
However, she didn&#39;t resent her partner for keeping things from her, 
either. Mireille was just doing what she thought was best. It made 
Kirika happy in a way, happy that Mireille felt the need to do such 
things for her.

Apparently coming to a decision, Mireille put on a rather weak smile and 
straightened her posture, before opening her mouth to speak. &quot;Kirika,&quot; 
she said, and the girl in question lowered her gaze from the ceiling and 
looked into the blonde&#39;s blue eyes. For some reason this made Mireille 
squirm, although nearly imperceptibly--Kirika doubted anybody but her 
would have noticed the action. &quot;I have something for you,&quot; the woman 
continued quietly, looking away from Kirika to the billiard table&#39;s 
green felt surface. &quot;I acquired a new one about a week after we arrived 
home,&quot; she explained as she crouched down beside the table and began 
running one hand underneath it, searching for something. &quot;It was just a 
precautionary measure,&quot; Mireille said, turning her head back to a mute 
and motionless Kirika. &quot;Ah, there.&quot;

Mireille stood up, and held in her hand was something that made Kirika&#39;s 
heart clench. A gun. A Beretta M1934 Commercial, to be exact. A firearm 
that Kirika had wielded with deadly proficiency for most of her young 
life... and had taken countless lives with. The mere sight of the weapon 
caused a swarm of repressed memories to resurface, all of them 
unwanted... and awful.

And there was a fear welling up too, the other fear alongside Mireille&#39;s 
safety, the second exception. A seed of darkness had awakened inside 
Kirika during her journey to the Manor, a seed of darkness that had 
bloomed into a black, bloated flower, putrid with poison and disease. 
And it still resided inside of her. Her other self. The one who had no 
name. The one who had attacked Mireille, the woman she loved, with 
genuine intent to kill her without mercy or hesitation--Kirika&#39;s 
darkness. Kirika&#39;s fear was that with giving in to violence her darkness 
would resurface again; she would lose herself again. Returning to her 
normal self that time at the ancient colosseum by the Manor had taken a 
supreme effort. Without Mireille provoking her old memories to 
re-emerge, Kirika believed she would have stayed lost, locked away in a 
part of her mind with the darkness as the warden. And even then if 
Mireille&#39;s mother, Odette Bouquet, hadn&#39;t planted a ray of light to 
fight that darkness inside of her before Kirika had claimed her life... 
in all probability Mireille would be dead and Kirika and Chloe would be 
Noir, under Altena&#39;s control.

&quot;It&#39;s clean, naturally,&quot; Mireille assured Kirika softly, oblivious to 
the taciturn girl&#39;s internal discord. &quot;Untraceable.&quot; She pulled the grey 
duct tape that had held the gun in its hiding spot under the billiard 
table off of the weapon, and after balling it up, idly tossed it beside 
the manila folder and her handbag where her own gun resided.

Gripping the Beretta by its barrel, Mireille held out the lethal firearm 
towards Kirika, albeit with a shade of reluctance. The woman&#39;s face was 
stony, but she quickly forced a reassuring though wan smile. It did 
little to comfort Kirika, and she believed Mireille knew that too, but 
had made the effort anyway. It was so unlike those early days. Kirika 
wondered if things like that would stay the same, despite the changes 
that indisputably would now occur in their lives.

With one steady but clammy hand, Kirika reached out to take the 
proffered gun. However, before she could, a sudden bolt in her mind 
conjured up the image of Altena when she was a young woman, with herself 
but a child, extending the same make and kind of weapon to her in an 
identical fashion. The first time Kirika had held a gun. The image was 
followed in a flash by a second, this one so like the first, but years 
later, with both participants older. But much the same.

Kirika&#39;s hand froze in mid motion, and it began to tremble--only 
minutely, hardly visible, but it did. She stared at the gun held out by 
her partner with wide, vacant eyes. The hand clenching her heart 
squeezed tighter.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Mireille inquired, the concern plain in her voice.

The sound of Mireille&#39;s voice brought Kirika back to the present, 
freeing her from the bitter, still disjointed memories of the past. She 
simply blinked and mentally shook off the feeling she was experiencing. 
Mireille was not Altena. It was different. It was.

Gingerly, as if with reverence but in reality with apprehension, Kirika 
took the Beretta from Mireille&#39;s grasp. It was heavier than she 
remembered. The weight told her it was fully loaded, however the 
darkhaired girl didn&#39;t think that was responsible for the sense of extra 
burden. The metal was cold in her grip and it chilled her skin, freezing 
her hand before the cool sensation crept gradually up her arm. Kirika 
felt something stir inside of herself. The darkness. It knew. It knew 
that Kirika Yuumura held her forced choice of weapon once again, her 
tool of murder and sin. It knew she would wield the gun and kill again. 
It was inevitable.

The hand Kirika held the weapon in suddenly looked as black as night in 
her eyes. Black with sin. Yes... she would inexorably be committing more 
sins too. Kirika had had a small hope that some of the sins that soiled 
her hands and blackened her soul had been burnt away to nothing along 
with her Beretta when it had been destroyed in the lava pool below the 
Manor. But of course it was a fantasy. Those sins were Kirika&#39;s alone, 
not the gun&#39;s. Not a simple tool&#39;s. She would always carry them with 
her. As she should.

&quot;There&#39;s more clips and bullets on the top shelf of the wardrobe,&quot; 
Mireille informed Kirika, watching her stare at the gun in her small 
hands, the girl apparently wholly enthralled. &quot;The leftovers from days 
gone by.&quot; The woman fidgeted uneasily for several moments, and then 
hugged herself, looking away from Kirika and down at the wooden 
floorboards of the room. &quot;It&#39;s getting late,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I think 
I&#39;ll take a shower. I feel... dirty.&quot; Mireille lingered for a few more 
seconds, but then turned away from the sight of Kirika and her new gun, 
proceeding at a brisk gait for the bedroom.

Kirika slipped the small Beretta into the right pocket of her parka, 
leaving it there. Instantly the warmth flooded back into her hand, like 
the pricking of many needles in her skin. The darkness inside her 
retreated back to the bleak caverns of her mind, back to where it slept. 
No... it slept no longer. It lurked now, waiting. It had retreated, but 
not completely. The cold touch of a gun--its gun--had emboldened it. But 
for now, it was kept at bay. Kirika wondered though. She wondered how 
long it would be. She and Mireille would be fighting once again. And 
Kirika doubted the two men they would be hunting would give them any 
quarter. It was only a matter of time until the darkness gained strength 
and tried to take control over her once more. When that moment came, 
Kirika was unsure if she would have the willpower to stop it.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

This was basically a new character introduction chapter. More 
information on the two members of the &#39;male Noir&#39; will be revealed next 
chapter. There are more new characters still to be introduced, but they 
won&#39;t show up until later parts.

Kirika in her standard outfit but with combat boots was inspired by the 
image of her on the cover of the Noir CD single, Coppelia&#39;s Coffin, sung 
by Ali Project.

Ryosuke and Vincent are your typical anime bishounen types. ^_^ Kaede 
has the &#39;hair-covering-the-eyes&#39; thing that some mysterious anime 
characters have (e.g. Luna Inverse from Slayers).

Oh, and I hope I got the legal mumbo-jumbo right. I&#39;m not a law student.
