	Another day, Mireille thought to herself as the light shone in her 
eyes again. One day she&#39;d have that window bricked in. Or at least 
remember to close the curtains. She felt the arms around her.

	She closed her eyes and somewhat worriedly checked herself for any 
warm wetness. Thank God, She sighed in relief as she detected nothing, 
not even a smell. Perhaps that misfortune had been more due to the 
drug&#39;s early workings than anything else. She hoped so at least.

	Mireille was laying on her side. Kirika was pressed up against her 
back. Years ago the thought of anyone, but especially a woman holding 
onto her so would have terrified her. But years of living, and sleeping 
with Kirika made it a common occurrence.

	Yet again the girl&#39;s arms were wrapped around her waist, but this 
time one of them was draped under her shirt and was resting on her 
stomach. Mireille could feel one of Kirika&#39;s legs between her own, the 
knee drawn up near Mireille&#39;s crotch. The girl&#39;s breathing was warm 
against her ear, the girl having her face nestled in Mireille&#39;s neck. 

	Against her will Mireille shivered, and she almost wondered 
whether she would be the one who needed a cold shower this morning. It 
was hardly her fault! Kirika was fairly straddling her, even if she was 
a girl, she was beautiful. Such contact would be making anyone think 
those thoughts. 

	&quot;Kirika. Kirika! Wake up, it&#39;s time to get up.&quot; She crooned in a 
rather rushed tone. She needed to be free of Kirika&#39;s warm embrace now! 
The contact was distracting her. The body behind her sighed and shifted 
a bit as the girl awoke. A natural response, her muscles bunched 
slightly, as she tried to orientate herself. The result however, was 
that her knee slid higher up Mireille&#39;s thigh, and her hand was now 
lingering dangerously close to Mireille&#39;s left breast. 

	&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Kirika yawned sleepily, snuggling deeper into the warmth 
offered by Mireille&#39;s own back. Mireille in turn wasn&#39;t breathing. 

	&quot;Time to get up!&quot; Mireille repeated a little louder, the girl 
moaned a tired grumble but didn&#39;t let go.

	&quot;I&#39;m tired, can&#39;t we just stay like this for a while. So I can get 
back to sleep?&quot; She rested her cheek against Mireille&#39;s warm neck. The 
contact making Mireille shiver slightly.

	Yeah Right, like you&#39;ll be sleeping! She thought somewhat 
uncharitably. &quot;No we have to get up now!&quot; There was a disgruntled moan 
and the small girl&#39;s arms retraced slowly. Mireille didn&#39;t miss the fact 
that Kirika let her arms drag along Mireille&#39;s stomach. So Kirika was 
still.... affected by the drug. Now she wanted more than just glances. 
Oh crap. Mireille thought, getting up and heading into the shower. 
Normally she changed in their main room. But she&#39;d be damned if she was 
getting naked near Kirika! 

	America tomorrow.... And then to find this cure. She thought to 
herself as the water cascaded from the showerhead, soaking her hair down 
her back. She had to wonder whether her clients would willingly give 
them this antidote. Her common sense told her they would hold out on 
her. Have her pay an extortionate amount for it, or maybe do some jobs 
for them. Needless to say, her chances of getting it straight out were 
nothing but slim.  

	When she exited the shower she was nothing if not surprised to 
find their apartment empty. Kirika had left. Searching around she found 
the hastily scribbled note on the table, sitting next to a full cup of 
tea for Mireille. 

	Mireille,

	Have gone out for a walk. Back later.

	-K

	&quot;Since when does Kirika go out for walks alone?&quot; She asked the 
empty apartment. But still, it did give her a little relaxing time to 
herself. Thank God. 


	Plane flight tomorrow. Kirika thought to herself, the fact 
bringing a rush of cheer that she thought most strange. Since when had 
she liked plane flights? And yet this time, she could hardly wait. To 
fly among the clouds!

	She held her arms out like wings and swerved along the path like a 
plane. The French people around her gave her curious looks but they only 
made her giggle. Hee-hee, this is too much fun. I wish Mireille was 
here. But it had been her idea to go out alone. She needed some time to 
think. Mainly about her new feelings for said blonde beauty. 

	The park would be a good place. It was peaceful there, and calm. 
With a nice cool breeze and the rustling of the leaves to lull her to 
sleep. 

	As she sat at a bench at the park she let her mind wander over 
herself and Mireille. It didn&#39;t take all that long for her to figure out 
what was wrong with her. The idea had already been banging around her 
head since last night. She was in love.

	With Mireille Bouquet. 


	It was late evening when Kirika returned. She looked happy and 
bright, Mireille thought when she saw her. Just like the normal girl 
Kirika had always longed to be. Perhaps when this was all over, Mireille 
could remind Kirika how just changing her attitude had wrought such a 
change. 

	Uh-oh. Mireille&#39;s mind chimed, noticing that the girl had the kind 
of expression on that told you she knew a secret you didn&#39;t. Not good. 
However Kirika&#39;s reaction surprised Mireille.

	The girl smiled a dazzling smile and pulled a small bouquet of 
flowers from behind her back, blushing a little as Mireille&#39;s mouth 
opened in surprise.

	&quot;Oh.&quot; Mireille breathed out in a surprised voice, the small 
bouquet of white roses was beautiful, and were Mireille&#39;s favourite. How 
had Kirika known? &quot;...Kirika...&quot; She breathed out, reaching out and 
accepting the gesture. The small girl seemed to blush more, her 
confidence wavering. Mireille felt sorry for her.

	&quot;Oh Kirika, they&#39;re beautiful.&quot; She said with a smile, reaching 
down and quickly planting a kiss on Kirika&#39;s cheek. The girl squeaked in 
surprise but luckily didn&#39;t try and lengthen the affection. Which 
Mireille was very thankful of. 

	She walked quickly into the kitchen to find a vase to place them 
in. She would put them on the table, so they could have a nice dinner 
with them tonight.

	As she came out of the kitchen, the vase with the roses in, in 
hand. She saw Kirika not looking her way. Instead she seemed to be 
looking out into space, thinking. Her face had a small and foolish smile 
on it, and her eyes were dreamy.

	Despite the cuteness, a small voice rang out in her head.

	She&#39;s started flirting. I can&#39;t just keep accepting her shows of 
affection and expect her not to want more.  Kirika noticed her and 
smiled bashfully. It seems the dance has just begun. She smiled back, if 
a little forcedly. 


	Sorry, this chapter ain&#39;t so funny. But I should be able to do 
better next time. I have plans. Heh-heh. And yet again!!! WILL SOMEONE 
PLEASE TELL ME HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FLY FROM FRANCE TO NEW YORK!!! 
I have looked on search engines, but it just keeps offering me prices 
for flights!!
