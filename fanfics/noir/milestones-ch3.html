<a href="../noir/milestones-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>I want you.

I want you so badly it hurts.

There you are, across the room, on the computer. It would be so easy. 
It would be so easy to walk over there, wrap my arms around you, and 
have my way with you. In fact, I think I will.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; I ask as I wrap my arms around you and kiss your neck.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; You ask as you lean back.

&quot;I want...I want...&quot; No! I&#39;m stumbling! Just say it, Kirika! 
&quot;Iwanttohavesexwithyou!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; you ask, confused.

Let me try again. &quot;I..want..to..have..sex..with..you..Mireille.&quot;

Wait. You&#39;re chuckling. Why? &quot;I was wondering when you&#39;d say it.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so transparent, at least to me. I&#39;ve been knowing how much you 
want me; I just wanted you to say it.&quot;

My face is burning, and I look down. &quot;Why?&quot; 

You chuckle and turn around. This isn&#39;t funny. I turn away from you. 
&quot;To see the look on your face when you try to spit it out. Aww, come on 
Kirika, don&#39;t take it so seriously.&quot; I feel your arms around me. You&#39;re 
nuzzling my neck. Do you think that makes it all right? Oh, wait, 
you&#39;re kissing me--mmm...it does make it all right. &quot;Follow me.&quot; You take my 
hand and lead me to our room.

You push me onto the bed and quickly remove my shirt. It feels 
cool...no...wait, it feels hot now. Because you&#39;re kissing my stomach. You&#39;re 
kissing...my stomach....wait, now you&#39;re moving up, to my chest...to 
my..aahh...that feels nice...mmm...keep doing it, Mireille. So nice. No 
dont stop...where are you going? I see. You&#39;re going down. My skirt, and 
my underwear, are suddenly gone. But you don&#39;t stop. What are you 
doing?.....My eyes are closed. I know they are. Your hands are grasping my 
thighs. And is that...is that your tongue? I open my eyes; yes it is! I 
didn&#39;t know you could do that. I close my eyes again and just...lay 
here.

It&#39;s so wet. And it feels...so good...like nothing...I&#39;ve ever felt 
before. I feel it. I feel myself smiling. I can&#39;t..I can&#39;t believe...I 
can&#39;t...Oh God...what&#39;s 
happening...what&#39;s...happen...wha....wh...uhhh....ahhh....uhhhh......!!!!!.....wha-what...was that? &quot;Wh...what..was 
that?&quot; I cautiously open my eyes. I&#39;m sitting up. I&#39;m grabbing your hair. 
How did that happen?

You smile and look at me. &quot;You reached orgasm.&quot;

Or-what? Whatever it was, it felt so good. Too good to be real. Please 
do it again. &quot;Mireille, please do it again.&quot;

You go back down, and you start again. Please don&#39;t stop. I don&#39;t want 
you to stop....

You&#39;re on top of me. You feel so warm. You didn&#39;t stop, not &#39;til I 
wanted you to. You didn&#39;t stop. I&#39;m so happy. So happy right now.

It&#39;s my turn now.</pre>
