<h1>Meet the Parent (part 15 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Starving, thirsty, cold, wounded, trapped - all Mireille felt was enough 
to blame herself to be so pathetic like she was thinking now. She and 
Kirika were captured, and worst, separated. What made things even worse 
was the threat Naomi had given to her. She said that Mireille would be 
died by next morning.

The next morning, now it was already. It was pretty early when Mireille 
woke up from her sleepless rest. Despite the coldness in the room, the 
Corsican girl somehow felt refreshed and warmed by the morning sunlight 
which illuminated by the small window beneath her. The chirping sounds 
of birds were the only sound she could heard vaguely. Hearing that, it 
sounded like the best lullaby in the world for her, considering that she 
would soon enough hear the tedious voice of Naomi.

A thought to think of a precaution plan to do if Soldats would truly 
launch her dead statement had flashed on her mind for many times. But, 
poor as Mireille was now, she could not push her brain to think of 
something, or even a good plan. It was not because her body felt stiff 
and cold. And it was not because of her poor health condition, or her 
wounded arm. It was also not because of her growling stomach, or her dry 
throat due to the lack of water.

It was because she felt... alone.

Ridiculous reason, it seemed. But still, tough it was hard to admit, the 
blonde felt that she was completely weak, helpless and vulnerable 
without Kirika by her side. It was only now that she had continued the 
living day without the Japanese girl by her side, not accompanied by the 
brunette&#39;s impassive behavior. It was just a couple of days, Mireille 
knew, but she could already feel the hole of need in her heart ; she 
needed Kirika, immensely. A little whisper from the brunette&#39;s lips, or 
even a short glimpse of the Japanese girl, alive, was maybe enough to 
cheer her up.

The Corsican girl really got the sudden urge to cry just by thinking of 
her lover. She wanted to know so badly about the Japanese girl 
condition. Is she lonely? Did she hurt? All that kind of thought 
disturbing her mind eventually. Wondering as she was, not only once that 
the thought of dying with Kirika along her side, together felt like 
acceptable, and alright, almost intriguing. The thought was comforting, 
and the blonde could not help resisted and drove it away from her mind.

She never got the chance to add some more reason to her &#39;comforting&#39; 
excuse tough, as the Corsican girl suddenly sensed a suspicious thing 
was moving from the corner of her eye. Her body tensed slightly, her jaw 
tightened immediately. Regardless of her being forever weak with her 
current state whoever or whatever came her way, Mireille viewed the room 
with a complete cautious, just out of habit. Her eyes darted carefully 
at all direction. She stared intensely, but minutes later nothing seemed 
to be moving or sneaking anymore. Maybe she was imagining things.

Sighing, Mireille felt dumb to even felt curious or careful like she was 
just back then.

I&#39;m about to die, and I&#39;m helpless right now. What can I do?

The Corsican girl lowered down her head silently. Deep in her heart, she 
hated to be killed, and completely opposedthe thought of dying, even 
together with Kirika. Afterwards, as her mind fall through a deep 
conflict and personality, the blonde grew even more and more confused of 
what to do.

She hates Naomi. She despises Soldats. But aside from all the hatred and 
grudges she hold, she wanted Kirika. This very point made her empty and 
lonely to the best part. Alone, thinking for a while, she abruptly 
realized that deep in her heart, one innate personality of her was 
crying out loud, pushing to break through her &#39;giving-up&#39; mind.

It was none other than her hatred to see herself being weak.

The blonde hated to see herself so weak, like now. She wanted to be 
tough, or rather, she must be tough like she used to be. She had had no 
parents since she was just a kid. Alone, small, nobody - no one would 
seek or come for her anymore. That was the thought she always kept since 
her parents&#39; death. Therefore, she made a decision since she was a kid, 
that she must learn to protect herself, for she had no other relatives 
left beside her Uncle, who had already dead now as well. No one could 
blame her determined will to be strong, for this reason.

Knowing this, Mireille grew even more perplexed to do anything. She was 
not fond to be so weak, pathetic. She was usually strong, formidable, 
energetic, and.. lively.

But what can I do? I don&#39;t have my gun, or any weapon to attack. And 
Kirika isn&#39;t with me..

Her mind once again flew to her lover. She wondered what the Japanese 
girl would do in her state. An answer popped out before she had the 
chance to finish asking the question.

..She will struggle.

She will struggle until the end.. That&#39;s Kirika.. Am I the same..?

A moment of debating and considering with her heart and thought passed, 
and Mireille finally came to a conclusion. She had made up her mind. If 
she were to die in the end, she would accept. But saving Kirika would be 
her first priority. The life of her lover must continue whatever it 
would take. That was what she had finally assumed after a long time of 
consideration.

Gaining confidence back to her soul, the Corsican girl laughed inwardly 
at her stupidity of not thinking and made her decision quicker. It was 
not her life that matter, it was Kirika&#39;s.

Mireille did not have the time to think further of what kind of plan 
would she do, as suddenly the sound of a door being opened roared inside 
the room. It seemed that Soldats had decided to pay one more visit to 
her luxurious dusty chamber. The sound of footsteps echoed in the room. 
Other than that, silence filled up the room.

The Corsican girl waited patiently, clenching her fists tightly and 
sharpened her gaze. A while after, the visitors showed their faces to 
the blonde. As expected, Naomi was there. And unsurprisingly, the other 
two men were exactly the same men from last time, Franchis and Martin, 
she recalled.

As the three of them proceeded to half-circling her, Mireille stared at 
the female Soldats, who was now wearing a white leather jacket and tight 
black jeans to cover her legs. Seeing this, the blonde remembered her 
last brutal action - she bit Naomi&#39;s leg. She smiled slightly, but kept 
her eye focus at Naomi. As soon as they stopped moving, Mireille snapped 
coarsely, &quot;What do you want?!&quot;

Naomi looked startled. Keeping the smile on her face, she said, &quot;I just 
want to see you for the last time, before you die.&quot;

Mireille grunted, then shut her mouth.

&quot;Actually,&quot; the female Soldats continued, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to have 
this much strength to even speak a word.&quot; Naomi glanced at Martin. &quot;Did 
you give her something to eat or maybe, drink?&quot;

The shorter man of the two answered quickly, &quot;No, Madam.&quot;

&quot;A beast such as her doesn&#39;t need food or drink to survive.&quot; The man 
with moustache stated loudly, her eyes flamed anger at Mireille.

The Corsican girl snorted. &quot;Like hell I will accept anything you offer.&quot;

Naomi frowned. &quot;You sure have good health and stamina,&quot; she muttered. 
&quot;not good for our plan.&quot;

Franchis turned her body and faced his leader. &quot;Madam, should we&#151;&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; the fake vet snapped. &quot;Not yet.&quot;

&quot;I heard that the other one has not ready as well.&quot; Martin said 
respectfully. &quot;Somebody had asked the doctor.&quot;

In the middle of that Soldats conversation, Mireille&#39;s eyes narrowed at 
the view of suspicious thing that caught her eyes. The bald headed man 
called Martin was holding some kind of black briefcase on both hands ; 
it hung awkwardly but safely behind his back. As the Corsican girl was 
about to stare more, the female Soldats walked toward her.

&quot;You,&quot; Naomi said seriously as she pointed one of her fingers at the 
blonde&#39;s forehead, &quot;are lucky this time.&quot;

Surprise to see the fake vet&#39;s face so close with her, Mireille&#39;s eyes 
widen and unconsciously gulped slightly.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Franchis walked over. &quot;If you want, I can make her&quot; he glanced 
at Mireille, &quot;ready.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love you to do so, Franchis.&quot; Naomi said. &quot;But, if the other one 
hasn&#39;t ready yet as well, it will not do.&quot;

&quot;..You are too kind to them.&quot; the moustache man mumbled vaguely.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot; Naomi stared sharply at the man, showing her 
disagreement. &quot;Do you have any other thing to say?&quot;

&quot;No, Ma&#39;am.&quot; Frachis said humbly despite her scowling expression and 
walked back to where he was before.

Naomi spun her body and scowled at the blonde. &quot;You two sure ruin my 
mood a lot.&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I will make your death very, very painful as 
a reward.&quot; she halted, as if doubting whether to say the next word or 
not. &quot;Tomorrow.&quot;

Mireille replied nothing to this. She had come to realize that her mouth 
was too dry, and it bean to torture her a little to speak some word. Not 
to mention that her head, and her whole body begun to ached more as 
well. It was not that she had something to say, too.

&quot;Just by looking at you..&quot; Naomi&#39;s voice was cold as it flowed through 
the air, &quot;makes me more and more desperate to kill you immediately by my 
own hands.&quot;

The blonde let out a small gasp. It came to Mireille that Naomi was sure 
enough in a bad mood today. The way she looked at the blonde was still 
the same devastating and perilous one, but one thing was missing. Naomi 
did not have her smile; the smile that used to hang foolishly on her 
Asian face. It was such an unreasonable reason to bring up, but the 
missing smile completely remarked Naomi even more as a heartless, cold 
devil, from Mireille&#39;s point of view.

Feeling a kind of heavy pressure filled the air in the room, the blonde 
remained as quiet as a statue. She still maintained the eye contact with 
Naomi, tough she wished to break it out now, as the latter&#39;s eyes were 
scowling at her in a cold, unfriendly manner Mireille did not want to 
describe. They kept their position in a mutual silence for a while. 
Naomi stared closely and sharply at the Corsican girl with the look of a 
hungry beast, while the blonde glared back tentatively. Tough Mireille 
found it hard to keep her eyes focus, due to her physical condition.

Abruptly and fortunately, Naomi broke the staring competition and turned 
on her heels, now facing her two comrades, backing Mireille. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; 
she commanded sternly as she walked away to the entrance door.

Martin and Frachis let out a solemn choir of, &quot;Yes, Madam.&quot; before did 
likewise.

Confused, the blonde just watched their leave vaguely and said nothing. 
Three figure of adult slipped between the old machines, making their way 
out hastily. Not too long after, the three Soldats had gone in sight, 
ended with the loud sound of door slammed. Now Mireille was back alone 
in the cold, dusty room, accompanied by piles of boxes and old machines.

Just in case that Naomi changed her mind and came back to kill her, 
Mireille waited for a long time, prepared to receive a sudden invasion 
out of nowhere. She waited in silence, but none came to the old smelly 
room she was trapped in. Puzzled by how to feel, the Corsican girl 
heaved out a long sigh.

Seems like my death &#39;ceremony&#39; will really be delayed..

Feeling a bit relax, Mireille&#39;s mind went through the conversation the 
Soldats had back then. They said something about Kirika not being ready, 
as well as herself.

What is this &#39;ready&#39; they were talking about?

Then there was the suspicious, secret-looking briefcase Martin was 
carrying. He did not bring it without purpose, Mireille was sure about 
it. Her instinct told her something was sneaky in there, might be even 
dangerous. It was such a pain to admit, but the blonde thought that 
Soldats really came up with a good plan this time, let alone the 
disguising act as Kirika&#39;s mother.

Mireille closed her eyes - she felt like it somehow - and tried to think 
and concentrate to guess what that Soldats&#39; had in mind. Minutes passed, 
and morning slowly changed to late noon, almost evening. To the blonde&#39;s 
satisfaction, none of Soldats came to her again while she was doing the 
only thing she could, which was thinking.

Desperately needed some answer, she stayed in silence, ignoring her 
starving stomach, and her dry throat. If she counted it right, Mireille 
assumed that she had not eaten and drunk anything since the day she was 
knocked out in the apartment, which meant about two days. Slowly, the 
outcome had begun to pain her.

Her left arm had somehow eased her in a bad way now ; she did not feel 
anything other than hardness and stiffness on that arm. In other words, 
it was possible that the arm itself had stopped functioning or acting 
properly, as Mireille found it pretty useless to try to move it. Her 
muscle did not obey her. Her head began to feel like spinning it made 
her wonder whether she was in a flat room or not. Worse, her whole body 
felt more and more cold and hard to move. Despite all that, she was 
shivering.

Realizing her condition, the blonde noticed that she may not even have 
the strength to look up or stare at Naomi again. It was fortunate that 
she had gained some spirit when the female Soldats came in the morning.

The room was dead silence, and slowly returning to its dark self as the 
night was coming soon, blocking the sunlight through the window. As if 
things were not worse enough, Mireille felt her head became dizzy, her 
body heat rise, but at the same time was cold. She may have a fever 
already. Her eyes felt heavy to open, and her head now lowered idly in 
no strength. Even breathing was not a simple matter anymore. Her stamina 
had almost reached its limit. Had Naomi seen her like this, the death 
penalty might be launched right away.

In the middle of her poor circumstance, the blonde caught a rustling 
sound from the boxes far on her right. Not much different than the first 
she heard back then. Dust and old as the room was, there was high 
possibility that here, the room she sat in, was the nest or source of 
little animals such as rats, lizards, or maybe, slugs. She did not care 
about it though, as her health condition would precisely need much more 
attention.

Unfortunately the rats, Mireille assumed, quite disturbing her as they 
were pretty noisy this time. Breathing hard, the blonde sensed that the 
rats snuffling, sneaking, and rustling audibly as if wanted to annoy her 
completely. In the middle of all that, while struggling enough to stay 
awake, the Corsican girl felt like she heard a human voice whispering to 
her.

..Maybe I&#39;ve become crazy.

Curious, Mireille forced every ounce of her strength left in her body to 
open her eyes and looked up. She glanced to her right, and surprisingly, 
saw a slight vision of something big moving. Her vision became blurry 
right after ; she was no longer strong enough to waste her energy to 
snoop rapidly. Her eyes fall shut once more.

&quot;Mireille!&quot; the blonde felt like hearing someone whispered her name 
vividly from faraway.

..I don&#39;t know that rats talk.

The rustling sound slowly changed into sneaky footsteps coming through 
Mireille&#39;s way. This time, she was almost sure it was human footsteps. 
The Corsican girl wanted to open her eyes, but failed to do so due to 
the seduction of resting. She felt sleepy, and about to fall asleep in 
no time..

&quot;Wake up, you lazy woman!&quot; the voice had become rather louder and 
clearer than last time, a woman&#39;s voice and a familiar one, Mireille 
assumed.

Then, she felt someone playing and struggling with the ropes and strings 
on her arms and her legs. Thoroughly, a brief slash of knife flicked in 
the air, in her ears, making her conscious again. Eyes shut, Mireille 
could feel her feet were free to move even without moving them ; they 
were no longer strapped on the chair.

Mireille swallowed the saliva in her mouth and gulped, before pushing 
her dry mouth to speak, &quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Who else will be here, you idiot?&quot; said the person whose cloth garment 
rustling through the blonde&#39;s skin as the person made her way to cut the 
rope and strings on her back with no difficulty.

Mireille thought for a second and asked tentatively, &quot;..Chloe?&quot;

The person cut the last rope which bind the blonde on hands and the 
backs, then sniffed. &quot;Hmph. Who else?&quot;

Later, the rope had completely gone by the blonde&#39;s body. It was 
supposed to be a relief had Mireille not become this weary. She felt her 
body had now felt utterly heavy and unstable enough. She felt her body 
swung weakly to her left, ready to crash the floor in no time unless 
Chloe saved her and hold her figure on both arms. The latter moved very 
gently and quickly. Unexpectedly, Mireille thought the hands holding her 
felt nice, strong, and stern.

Finally got a nice surface to rest, the urge to sleep once again seduced 
her. She was about to sleep when she felt a liquid splashing her lips, 
her mouth. She licked the liquids, despite the little amount of energy 
she had.

&quot;Now drink.&quot; Chloe ordered in a strict voice, as one of her hand which 
grasp the mineral water bottle drew closer to Mireille&#39;s mouth.

As Chloe gave her best to make Mireille drink a lot, the Corsican 
gratefully received the liquid she demanded for long time. They stayed 
like that for a long time, until Mireille had finally finished a full 
bottle.

&quot;Can you.. open your eyes?&quot; Chloe asked softly.

Mireille grunted softly, and tried to open her eyes slowly. The vision 
was blurry as usual, before turning to a rather vivid scene, a view of a 
purple haired kid looking worriedly right in front her face.

The blonde realized that she was being hold by Chloe strongly, and felt 
somehow ashamed. She hid her blush by struggling to look away and moved 
her body from the green cloaked girl. &quot;Uh.&quot; Mireille mumbled as she 
moved her body to the floor, using her right hands to push. Chloe let 
the blonde did so, as she eventually helped the Corsican girl to sit.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; the blonde finally said as soon as she sat upon the wall. 
She still felt tired, but not as tired and sleepy as she was before. She 
felt so much better now. She had at least, drank water.

Mireille saw Chloe sat herself beside her, and now searching something 
in her green cloak. &quot;Here,&quot; the purple haired girl said as she let go a 
piece of fresh bread in her palms. &quot;Eat it.&quot;

The bread looked delicious on Chloe&#39;s hand, Mireille thought, 
considering she had not eaten anything the past few days. She took the 
bread and ate it in silence, while Chloe&#39;s eyes running through the 
room, scanning it.

&quot;You can eat in ease, I&#39;ll sense if someone coming.&quot; the purple haired 
girl stated calmly as her eyes wandered inside the room. &quot;Does your left 
arm.. alright?&quot; Chloe asked in an unexpected gentle voice.

&quot;..It seems dead to me.&quot;

How come it&#39;s alright..? First, it was stabbed. Then, it was shot by 
that Naomi bastard. Thank goodness it&#39;s still exist.

&quot;..Oh.&quot;

Silence once again stretched between them, as Mireille munched her bread 
and Chloe now staring at her mutely. As soon as she had eaten the bread, 
the Corsican girl felt more energetic than before.

&quot;Thank you, Chloe.&quot; she said softly, looking at the purple haired girl.

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Chloe mumbled.

Mireille was about to ask about how and why the purple haired girl came 
here, had her eyes not widen as she saw Chloe&#39;s face close by. There 
were deep scratches everywhere along the girl&#39;s white, pale face. There 
was also more than one red or blue mark beneath her eyes. A sticky 
looking blood mark on the corner of the purple haired girl&#39;s lips caught 
her attention, too. The body, Mireille could not see; it was covered by 
her green cloak, however.

&quot;What happened to you, Chloe?!&quot; Mireille asked worriedly.

&quot;It&#39;s not important.&quot; Chloe hurriedly replied and looked away from the 
blonde.

&quot;You&#151;&quot;

&quot;What matters now is,&quot; Chloe once again seek something in her cloak, 
&quot;that you bring this.&quot; she offered a white thick envelope to Mireille. 
&quot;Don&#39;t open it while I&#39;m still here.&quot;

&quot;What is this?&quot; Mireille asked in bewilderment as soon as she took the 
thick envelope.

&quot;The useful information you&#39;ll need if the condition gets worse. It is 
possible that you may not open it.&quot;

&quot;..I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;In other words,&quot; Chloe said in a hasty tone, &quot;You will only open it if 
I&#39;m not here anymore. If I have the time, I will explain it to you 
myself without you have to bother seeing the paper written inside.&quot;

&quot;..Okay.&quot; Mireille replied. &quot;Now can you tell me what happened to.. your 
face?&quot; she ventured in a soft tone.

The purple haired girl remained silent for a while before giving her 
answer. &quot;Not that much different than your arm.&quot;

Did not completely get the meaning but decided to say no more, Mireille 
turned the envelope upside down, swap it to the left or to the right, 
until she somehow satisfied and slipped it into her pocket.

&quot;Now,&quot; Chloe stood up suddenly, &quot;Are you fit enough to get out of here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

&quot;Come here, then.&quot; Chloe walked quickly and gestured at the pile of 
boxes on the right.

Mireille hobbered; this was the first time she moved her legs, after 
all. She followed the purple haired girl to the right edge of the room 
which covered and blocked by plenty piles of boxes in sight. When Chloe 
stopped walking, the blonde did likewise. The purple haired girl moved 
some boxes aside, pushed a high piles one of it, and eventually, the 
Corsican girl could see a big hole hanging on the wall.

Ignoring all question on her mind as to why such hole would exist, 
Mireille grew worried as she realized that they would run away. &quot;What 
about Kirika?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s okay. Soldats won&#39;t kill her, I assure you.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time to explain.&quot;

&quot;..I&#39;m not leaving her behind. Never.&quot;

&quot;We will only leave her until you are healthy enough to fight and kill.&quot; 
Chloe muttered. &quot;You don&#39;t think that I&#39;m alone is enough to face them, 
do you?&quot;

&quot;But&#151;&quot;

Chloe&#39;s eyes met the blonde&#39;s. &quot;You must trust me.&quot; she said seriously, 
but in a soft voice. &quot;We&#39;ll definitely return and get her back.&quot;

&quot;I can fight now.&quot; the blonde insisted.

&quot;You can&#39;t. Not with your condition now. We will lose.&quot; the younger girl 
whispered. &quot;You have no idea how many they are.&quot;

&quot;But Kirika&#151;&quot;

&quot;That Naomi won&#39;t kill her..&quot; Chloe paused. &quot;.. without you.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Mireille.&quot; The purple haired girl called out the blonde&#39;s name in a 
soft tone. &quot;Just believe me, will you?&quot; she asked desperately, almost 
pleading.

Mireille&#39;s eyebrow rose in surprise. Chloe seemed really desperate to 
save her, at any rate. She was quite astonished to see the other side of 
Chloe she had not seen before, especially since the girl came. The 
latter&#39;s action had been quite astounding, and surprisingly, gentle. 
Considering, Mireille finally made up her mind and nodded solemnly after 
a while.

&quot;Good. Follow me.&quot; Chloe whispered as she lowered her body and walked 
through the hole which was big enough to the size of a kid.

Outside, night had fallen. As soon as she passed the hole, Mireille 
could see a big grassy field in sight. It occurred to her that they were 
outside somewhere, standing in the middle of a cold windy night in a 
large, green field.

&quot;Hurry.&quot;

Nodded to herself, Mireille quicken her pace with all her might, 
obediently followed the purple haired girl back who was walking her way 
across the field. For some reason, Chloe did not run, which Mireille 
felt as gratitude.

Watching Chloe&#39;s back, Mireille found that she had not got the chance to 
ask why the girl seemed pretty determined to save her. The answer would 
not be far from the sake of Kirika, Mireille predicted. She decided to 
remember to ask for it later when the two of them were resting, other 
than hurrying escaping as if they were fugitives.

Suceeded in passing along the grassy field after some time, the two of 
them now walked quickly down the side road of an old village, under the 
shining light of the moon above. The so called village, however, was not 
in the proper state of be called as one. The village, which Mireille 
found very unattractive, seemed dead without plants around and worst 
enough, had no lively sign at all. It was kind of unlikely that someone 
would bother to live anywhere in here. The village&#39;s houses, which 
obviously abandoned, were pretty much looked like battered as well. 
Broken doors, scattered glasses, robbed curtains, tainted roofs were 
visible all along the way.

Sneezing and breathing hardly due to the cold and wind, the blonde tried 
her best to walk faster. The road was surprisingly long and exhausting, 
as if it had no end at all. They walked in silence - their footsteps, 
which clattering almost inaudibly, softly down the night street was the 
only thing heard. The houses were no good view at all as the blonde got 
a bad feeling just by glancing at one of them &#150; she guessed that it may 
have some ghosts inside.

Shivering, tired, Mireille patiently forced her feet to keep walking. 
Time after time passed, and the Corsican girl begun to feel very 
exhausted, as her body was also cold. From behind, she could see that 
Chloe was also shuddering because of the chilly freezing wind. A thought 
of Kirika and her resting in the warm, immense bed in her apartment 
occurred to her mind. She imagined the soft texture of the bed, the 
fluffy pillow she used to hug, the warmth from the Japanese girl&#39;s 
body..

&quot;Walk faster and get beside me.&quot; All of the sudden, Chloe whispered in a 
low, startling voice.

Obediently, Mireille did what she was told and now stood right beside 
Chloe, and saw the purple haired girl&#39;s pale face. Not because of the 
weather, Mireille noticed, as she was soon enough sensed the same 
feeling with Chloe.

There was someone watching them, somewhere.

&quot;Take this,&quot; Chloe slipped something metal and cold to Mireille&#39;s hand. 
A gun.

Mireille received it carefully. The gun weight felt awkward on her hand 
at first, but it turned to be comforting soon. It had been two days 
since her usual gun had been taken from her - two days since she hold a 
gun, a weapon. Mireille hid the metal thing inside her heavy pocket. 
Then, despite the situation, the two of them walked casually like 
before.

Whoever the person snooping at them were quite smart and experienced to 
sneak. Mireille had not sensed anymore the sign of their existence; 
maybe they had run, or much likely, hiding. The houses were suspicious, 
obviously, but houses were everywhere alongside the road they walked on. 
Any houses would do for hidden places.

Cautiously, Mireille and Kirika sent their eyes to wander through the 
village. Nothin happened so far ; none came to ambush them, yet they 
kept walking further in great vigilance. Abruptly, something shiny came 
visible to their eyes. Narrowing her eyes, Mireille realized that there 
was something eerie from the old house not much further on the left and 
right side of the road. Despite all dusty, taunted condition of the 
house, the house definitely was unlike the other houses ; all the lights 
in the house were suddenly on. It was almost as if anyone in the houses 
wanted their existence to be recognized by turning on the electricity.

Chloe seemed to notice it too as her stare kept focused on the same 
direction as Mireille. The two of them halted for a second, before 
started to walk again. They did not communicate, as they were pretty 
much aware of how to act. They had no other option &#150; they would have to 
walk through the house, for the road was dead straight without junction. 
No matter what, they got to pass the house to escape. Slowly and 
cautiously, they walked closer and closer to the house.

&quot;Maybe.. they&#39;re just some curious villagers.&quot; mumbled Mireille, despite 
her own doubt.

&quot;No. Here is still their territory.&quot;

The Corsican girl squeaked slightly.

&quot;Yes. Looks like there&#39;s really no way we can escape so smoothly.&quot; Chloe 
gave a pause. &quot;Not as long as Naomi is the one in charge.&quot;

Mireille gave no reply to this. Experience had taught her that Naomi was 
not one to underestimate.

&quot;There&#39;s a wooden bridge right straight ahead.&quot; Chloe whispered softly 
while they kept walking. &quot;Cross it and go further along the pathways and 
you will see a small town. Go to the inn and rest.&quot;

&quot;Wha&#151;&quot;

&quot;When I tell you to run, you run.&quot; Chloe added seriously, facing the 
confused blonde. &quot;..I beg you.&quot;

Mireille&#39;s eyes widen in surprise and shock. Unfortunately she had no 
time to say anything, as Chloe grabbed her arms and pulled her in an 
amazing strength, forcefully brought the Corsican girl to run forward, 
clearly approaching the trap house. Despite her surprise, her weary feet 
still followed the girl. As expected, a lot people burst out from the 
house to greet them, each single one brought a weapon with them on their 
hands. Seeing how many those people were just in a short glimpse, 
despite being grabbed by Chloe, the blonde pulled out her gun, preparing 
to shoot.

But she never got the chance - Chloe did not yet stop running. They run 
passed the people, the house. Amazed at the running speed of the purple 
haired girl, Mireille pretty much convinced that they would escape 
without bothered to make harm, had Chloe did not so suddenly stop.

&quot;NOW RUN!&quot; Chloe hissed loudly as she roughly let go of the grab. The 
purple haired girl turned and run back to the houses she once passed, 
leaving Mireille far, alone.

Startled by that sudden release, Mireille almost fall to the hard ground 
had she not suceeded in balancing and rolled herself. She staggered to 
her feet, looked back, and noticed that she was not that far from where 
Chloe released her &#150; the battlefield. The purple haired girl was already 
in the middle of the fight ; at least ten people were circling her 
bravely. Launching her knives in prodigy speed while running and 
dodging, Chloe definitely did well in that perilous situation. One by 
one, the attackers begun to fall. But at the same time, more and more 
people emerged from the houses, speed on their feet, eyes focused on the 
invader girl, determined to kill. The fight continued. No one glanced at 
the blonde&#39;s direction, despite the place she was standing on was only 
around six meters away from them.

Out of characters, and to Mireille&#39;s surprise as well, she found herself 
stood still on her silent place, watching -her gun rest inside her palm, 
lying behind her waist. She wanted to help the purple haired girl, but 
something in her mind refused to do so. Then, despite the crucial 
situation, somehow her eyes got the chance to meet Chloe&#39;s. In a brief 
moment, regardless of how busy she was while striking down enemies, the 
latter had managed to keep the eye contact for a sufficient time. Their 
eyes had talked.

It was just a short contact, yet the act had helped Mireille made her 
decision. Somehow, just right after that moment, she turned her body and 
run at the maximal speed her feet could bring her, to the town Chloe 
told her before. She run, one hand holding the gun, the other securing 
her pocket, where a white envelope laid inside.</pre>
