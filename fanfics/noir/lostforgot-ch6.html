<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;I trust that everything went well,&quot; Althena smiled down at her young 
prot&eacute;g&eacute; while she wrote a letter, the younger girl sitting on one of the 
two stools, watching.

Chloe was silent for a moment before responding, &quot;He says that he has to 
desire to harm Noir.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Althena nodded slowly, then turned back to her letters.

Several minutes passed before Chloe tentatively asked, &quot;Am I to deliver 
those as well?&quot;

The older woman shook her head slowly, &quot;I can see you wish to stay. I 
will send others with these.&quot;

Chloe nodded, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

As the girl rose and exited the room Althena sighed, my darling Chloe, I 
hope that you will help your love find her place, but I fear that 
troubling circumstances will soon arise. I only hope that you can 
overcome them and fulfill your sublime destiny. I hope that all goes 
well for you, that you will not be disappointed. However, I fear that I 
will feel the pain of false hope.

Chloe lay back on her pillow, still tired after her restless sleep the 
night before. Althena had granted her a sort of vacation from her 
duties. She knows I wish to spend time with Kirika, the girl smiled and 
blushed into her pillow at the thought of the assassin, of how she had 
come to her door the night before. After a moment she turned her head to 
the side, Perhaps, soon, Kirika, you will share this bed with me like 
you had before, her face turning a deep shade of crimson Chloe smiled at 
the empty half of the large bed where her partner used to sleep.

&quot;Are you awake?&quot; The soft voice whispered into Chloe&#39;s ear from the 
darkness.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the girl replied, &quot;I am. No, don&#39;t, someone will hear,&quot; Chloe 
warned as Kirika moved closer to the girl as they lay in bed, placing 
her lips on Chloe&#39;s ear, then her neck in a series of very soft kisses.

&quot;No one&#39;s around,&quot; the other teenager whispered into her ear, &quot;No one 
will hear.&quot;

Quietly Chloe surrendered, though not all that unhappily, to her lover 
as Kirika pulled the younger girl closer.

I wonder where Chloe is, Kirika thought mildly as she wandered through 
the ruins of the manor, she called for me last night, and I know it. Was 
she dreaming? About what? . . . About something I can&#39;t even remember, 
she leaned against a crumbling pillar, sighing dejectedly, I need to do 
something. To remember.

&quot;Kirika!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the girl turned to see Mireille stepping around a crumbling wall.

&quot;So this is where you&#39;ve been,&quot; Mireille leaned against the pillar next 
to Kirika, smiling, trying to keep her cool and appear nonchalant&quot;You 
weren&#39;t at breakfast; I was wondering if you&#39;d gotten lost or 
something.&quot;

&quot;Uh, no,&quot; Kirika looked out across the vineyard silently for several 
minutes.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

Mireille sighed, &quot;I guess you never were much of a talker. What are you 
doing out here?&quot;

&quot;Trying to remember,&quot; the younger assassin replied.

&quot;What do you mean, remember what?&quot; Mireille&#39;s brow furrowed.

Kirika gazed out at the vineyards for what seemed hours to Mireille 
before turning back to the Corsican, &quot;Everything,&quot; she whispered and 
began walking away.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille called after her, not sure what was going on with the 
girl, &quot;I want to help. Tell me what&#39;s going on and I can help.&quot;

Kirika continued walking away slowly, &quot;No, no you can&#39;t. Perhaps . . .&quot; 
she craned her head towards the manor, &quot;Perhaps Chloe can.&quot;

Mireille couldn&#39;t stop a sort of growl from escaping her, &quot;How&#39;s that 
little freak going to help?&quot;

Kirika turned to protest, but was at a loss for how to defend Chloe. 
Stop insulting my friend? You don&#39;t know anything about her? Is she my 
friend? Do I know anything about her? Is she something . . . more than a 
friend? Dejectedly, Kirika just walked briskly back to the manor, 
leaving a very angry assassin in her wake.

&quot;Augh!&quot; Mireille banged her fists on the stonework of the old ruin, 
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?!&quot;

&quot;Is there something the matter?&quot; Althena asked softly from behind 
Mireille, causing the Corsican to gasp and turn to the unnoticed 
spectator.

Mireille&#39;s anger flared, &quot;Yes, there&#39;s something the matter! I find out 
the Soldats want Kirika and I dead, I get whisked away to some 
godforsaken creepy old mansion while someone burns down my apartment, 
I&#39;m being &#39;protected&#39; by some senile woman and her freaky little 
sidekick, Kirika never talks to me anymore and as far as I can see 
there&#39;s no one after me anymore,&quot; Mireille panted at the end of her long 
rant, glaring into the elder woman&#39;s passive face.

&quot;I understand that you are frustrated,&quot; Althena began quietly, &quot;I did 
not foresee so much opposition. I am working to determine where it is 
originating but have not had much luck. You are free to leave if you 
wish but I ask you to stay, for yours and Kirika&#39;s safety.&quot;

&quot;But we already know it&#39;s the Soldats!&quot; Mireille protested, &quot;That&#39;s 
where it&#39;s originating from!&quot;

The woman smiled slightly, &quot;The Soldats is a very . . . complex 
organization. It is made up of several different sects, each with 
different ideals and goals. The attack on your apartment as well as the 
ongoing threat to Noir is coming from one or a group of the sects, not 
the Soldats in general. It is merely a matter of time before we discover 
the source.&quot;

&quot;And how do you know so much about the Soldats,&quot; Mireille demanded 
angrily.

&quot;I have had dealings with them before,&quot; Althena explained vaguely, &quot;Now 
if you will excuse me I need to see to my duties.&quot;

As the woman retreated back to the manor Mireille grimaced, I knew she 
knew something. What kind of &#39;dealings&#39; does she have with them? 
Mireille sighed, I suppose the only way to find out is to stay and see. 
But I&#39;ll have to be careful. This is getting more suspicious by the day. 
I&#39;ll go tell Kirika that these people have something to do with the 
Soldats, she smirked slightly, Looks like your &#39;friend&#39; Chloe isn&#39;t so 
friendly after all. I knew she wasn&#39;t to be trusted.</pre>
