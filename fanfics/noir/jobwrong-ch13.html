<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 13 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a>

<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Kirika snuggled deeper into the blankets, searching for the warmth and 
comfort she technically knew was there. And yet all she found was 
suffocating blankets and coldness. She knew why.

Frustrated at not being able to sleep she kicked the covers off herself 
and silently padded to the door of the bedroom. Searching for the 
Mireille, the woman she needed if she was to be able to sleep. In a way 
she had to wonder if this wasn&#39;t some twisted kind of dependency, that 
she couldn&#39;t even sleep unless she has Mireille with her.

It was late. Well, only midnight actually, but compared to when they 
usually went to bed it was late. Almost two hours ago Mireille had sent 
her off to the shower and then to bed, claiming that she just had to 
look through their job description before joining. Kirika had complied, 
Mireille always handled that stuff anyway.

But two hours?

The door opened silently as she slithered out of the crack and into the 
main room of their suite. There was a dim light coming from over by the 
kitchen, illuminating a slouched figure at the bar.

Sighing exasperatedly Kirika creeped over to the blonde. She was 
slouched over the glass bar, with her head resting on her arms, those 
crossed over sheets of writing.

She was fast asleep.

What to do?... Carry her to bed? She looked at the blonde, taller and 
heavier than her, hardly a feather awake, a dead weight whilst asleep.

Curl up by her and sleep? Cute, but impractical.

Wake her up? ... Suicidal.

Admire her whilst she&#39;s asleep? Ten minutes passed in silence, before 
Mireille opened a sleepy eye.

&quot;Kirika, will you stop staring at me whilst I&#39;m asleep, it&#39;s creeping me 
out.&quot; Kirika smiled to herself as the blonde groggily orientated herself 
with the room.

&quot;I was debating how to wake you up.&quot; She answered almost truthfully. 
Mireille nodded whilst stifling a large yawn. &quot;Why have you been up so 
late anyway?&quot;

At those words Mireille&#39;s eyes instantly snapped open with clarity, 
which was soon dimmed with misery but a moment later. Kirika watched the 
spectacle in a confused manner. What was she supposed to do? Comfort 
her? Ask her what&#39;s wrong?

&quot;Mireille...?&quot;

&quot;Yes Kirika. We have our target.&quot; The words were spoken like the tolling 
of a bell, Kirika didn&#39;t like the sound of it one bit. A sheet of paper 
was thrust under her nose, hesitantly she took it from Mireille&#39;s hand. 
A line written in bold caught her attention.

Target: Laura Marcis. Psychologist, twenty six years of age... She 
didn&#39;t have to read anymore.

&quot;Mireille, we can&#39;t, we-&quot; She blurted out in a rush, Mireille 
interrupted her.

&quot;Kirika, I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re assassins. We don&#39;t have a choice, we need 
what they have.&quot; Kirika couldn&#39;t believe what Mireille was saying.

&quot;But she&#39;s my friend!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always told you in this profession you can&#39;t just make friends.&quot; 
Kirika stepped back, her breathing hard. What was Mireille saying? Why! 
She wasn&#39;t trying to be cruel, Kirika could see the sorrow in her eyes. 
But why did they have to do this?

&quot;What do they have that we need! Nothing bad has come of that stuff I 
took, I&#39;ve not been ill!&quot; Mireille gave her a strange glance, she had 
seen it before whenever she mentioned the illness. As if it was so 
obvious that she was surprised Kirika herself could not see it.

&quot;Look, Kirika.&quot; She began in a patient voice, &quot;There IS something wrong 
with you, and we need that cure, please just trust me and don&#39;t ask 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;Kirika! NO! We HAVE to do this. Please, just accept it already!&quot; 
Mireille&#39;s voice was angry and exasperated, her eyes steely. As if she 
was losing her patience with this game.

&quot;She has a family...&quot; Kirika whispered, referring to the husband and 
child Laura had mentioned.

Had Mireille been less tired she might have thought more about her 
answer. As it was, fatigue, lack of patience, and her own sadness made 
her answer instantly.

&quot;That didn&#39;t stop you when you slaughtered my family.&quot;

The words hit Kirika like a blow. Her eyes widening was the only 
indication she gave of the pain she felt.

Mireille hasn&#39;t forgotten, maybe hasn&#39;t forgiven. She still remembers... 
Still holds it against me...

&quot;I&#39;m... sorry...&quot; Those were the only words Kirika could manage to choke 
out of herself. Mireille looked to be about to answer, climbing out of 
her chair, but Kirika ran, gripped by insecurity and sudden fear. She 
didn&#39;t want to hear what Mireille had to say, just the chance that it 
might be &quot;goodbye&quot; frightened her enough to run.

----------

Mireille watched Kirika slam the bedroom door behind her. Her own 
shoulders slumped miserably. Why had she said that? Was her family&#39;s 
death still weighing on her? Of course it was, but she had never even 
thought of Kirika as the killer. It had been her to pull the trigger, 
but Alteana to give her the gun, Alteana to aim the barrel, Alteana to 
choose the targets. Kirika had been an innocent bystander the entire 
time.

Even in the rain, in the graveyard, with Kirika crying for her to kill 
her, even then she had forgiven the small Asian girl.

----------

Kirika was crying quietly to herself. The tears had already soaked the 
pillow her head was resting on. Mireille didn&#39;t love her. She hated her. 
How could she have been so foolish? To think, that anyone could love 
her, but especially someone who had killed their family? Tomorrow she 
would leave, be gone, and let Mireille live the happy life she deserved 
and not this life of death with her.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; She sobbed out, hugging the blonde&#39;s pillow tighter 
against herself, she could just smell the woman&#39;s fragrance on it, as if 
she were in the same room. It was not comforting, only serving to make 
her cry harder.

The bed flexed as a weight settled in beside her, she tried to ignore it 
as she held the pillow against herself, forcing herself not to need 
Mireille. I can do this, I&#39;m strong... Her heart said otherwise.

Arms reached across her, pale skin encircling her small body as Mireille 
pressed herself comfortingly against her back. Despite the pain in her 
heart, the motion was still comforting.

&quot;Mireille, don&#39;t.&quot; She whispered, it would be hard enough to leave 
already.

&quot;No.&quot; The Corsican blonde replied firmly. &quot;No, I won&#39;t.&quot; Kirika turned 
slowly, and was met by soft, gentle blue eyes.

&quot;Mireille...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you Kirika. I&#39;ve never blamed you for their deaths, it 
wasn&#39;t you. I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry I ... acted... just... sorry. Please 
forgive me?&quot; Kirika cried harder, but this time buried her face into 
Mireille&#39;s nightie. Soft soothing hands stroked her hair.

Her tears were real, they always were. She had been so close, so close 
to leaving Mireille forever. What if Mireille had been too embarrassed 
or too proud to apologise? Kirika would have left and they would never 
see each other again. She cried harder.

&quot;Shhh... it&#39;s okay Kirika. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here.&quot;

Yes, Mireille was here, here with her. And she would never leave.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; The blonde looked down at her, a fond and yet almost tearful 
look on her face. It made Kirika&#39;s heart swell.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Kirika wondered how to phrase her thoughts, in the end she gave 
up trying.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; Another pause.

&quot;What is it Kirika?&quot;

&quot;I...- love you.&quot;

There was a long pause. A cacophony of complete silence.

&quot;Get some sleep Kirika, tomorrow is going to be complicated, I can just 
see it.&quot;

Kirika mumbled in the affirmative, slightly disappointed by Mireille&#39;s 
refusal to answer or reply. But, Mireille needed it slow, Kirika just 
wanted to make sure Mireille didn&#39;t doubt her own feelings one bit.

&quot;I love you Mireille.&quot; She whispered again, this time too quiet for the 
blonde to hear. &quot;I love you more than life itself.&quot;
