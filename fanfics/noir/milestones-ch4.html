&quot;Hai.&quot; So, you decided to have Japanese tonight, miso, in fact. I take 
it you got bored of French?

&quot;Lettuce.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Mushrooms.&quot;

I hand over the mushrooms and snicker as you try to read the direction, 
written in Japanese, on the packages. &quot;Here.&quot; I snatch and read them 
with ease, then prepared the soup base. I go set the table while you 
finish chopping the vegetables.

In a few minutes dinner&#39;s ready. There&#39;s this quietness as we eat. It&#39;s 
not uncomfortable; it&#39;s rather peaceful....Mireille? Mireille, are you 
having trouble with your chopsticks?!

&quot;What? Is there something on my teeth?&quot; No, it&#39;s just you can&#39;t use 
chopsticks.

&quot;Here, I&#39;ll help you,&quot; I say as I get up and put my arms around you. 
&quot;You hold it like a pencil. Like this.&quot; I put your fingers where they 
should be. &quot;Wha...no, no, like *this*.&quot; I reposition them. &quot;Now move them 
like this.&quot; I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re having a hard time with this; it&#39;s 
so easy.


Afterwards, we drink tea. Not green tea; I know how much you hate it. 
Do you remember when I disappeared while you were shopping? I was out 
buying Darjeeling. I know how much you like it. It feels cozy...sitting 
here, sipping tea, your hand laced with mine.

&quot;Kirika?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m thinking of opening a tea shop.&quot; Where did that come from? &quot;I&#39;m 
getting bored. Hits aren&#39;t coming in anymore, we&#39;re not otherwise 
employed, and shops are getting old.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll sell tea.&quot;

&quot;I take it you&#39;ll join me?&quot;

&quot;Hai. If you let me stock green tea.&quot;

&quot;Anything you want. We&#39;ll even stock purple tea if you like.&quot;

I snicker and shake my head slowly. There&#39;s no such thing as purple 
tea.</pre>
