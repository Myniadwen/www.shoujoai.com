<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>The coldness of the room matches the bitterness of the night spent with 
Mireille; even though we&#39;re in the same bed, I might as well be alone. 
She stayed up late on the computer, seeming to want to avoid me. I sigh 
and look at her, facing away from me, still sleeping. She must have 
stayed up very late to not wake up before me- or perhaps my nightmares 
kept her up again. A small twinge of guilt washes over me and I get up 
quietly and go out to the dining room.

I sit at the table, and put my head down in my hands. I hear the door 
open and Uncle&#39;s voice as he speaks with Henry. I lift my head up and 
smile at him as he comes into the dining room.

&quot;Good morning, Uncle.&quot; I&#39;m glad to see him. He looks tired, and seems to 
move more slowly than usual. &quot;How are you feeling this morning?&quot;

&quot;No worse than you.&quot; He smiles in a kind way that makes me feel like 
crying. He moves toward me and I get up out of the chair, stumbling into 
him. His arms go around me and I sob into his neatly pressed suit.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I gulp out. I am Noir, I should be stronger than this.

&quot;We are all in our own pain.&quot; His hand gently pats my hair. &quot;Even 
Mireille.&quot;

I sob again at this and nod my head. &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s all changing.&quot;

He says nothing, stroking my hair as tears run down my face. I fight for 
some control, but the sleepless nights have made me so tired that 
there&#39;s little fight left in me.

&quot;Did she show you the telegram?&quot; his voice swirls in amongst my sorrow.

&quot;What? Oh- no.&quot; I say, blinking my eyes rapidly and trying to focus 
myself.

&quot;Not even you...&quot; Uncle looks down at me. &quot;Interesting. And.... 
disturbing.&quot;

&quot;What-&quot; I start, but he holds up his finger, quieting me.

&quot;She&#39;s supposed to be your partner, isn&#39;t she? In every way, even as 
Noir. And yet, she keeps this telegram to herself. Why?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask her to see it.&quot; I look up at him, my tears gone, now 
replaced by curiosity.

&quot;I doubt that she&#39;ll show it to you.&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;And I doubt 
that this will be the only one she receives.&quot;

I stare up at him, not understanding fully what he means, but I feel 
something twist in my heart.

&quot;You know of Droger&#39;s intentions with Mireille. I believe he made that 
quite clear.&quot;

A Queen. One that all the knights will fear and obey.

&quot;I&#39;ll protect her.&quot; I square my shoulders up.

&quot;So clever. So clever, to get her to come to him.&quot; He closes his eyes. 
&quot;How do we protect her from herself?&quot;

I step back in shock. &quot;But she wouldn&#39;t do that- she would never do 
that!&quot;

He sits down heavily, and takes my hand in his.

&quot;It&#39;s no secret that Mireille hates Soldats. Any more than it&#39;s a secret 
that Droger hates us. Revenge.....is a powerful motivator.&quot;

A sudden memory of Mireille in car on the way to the prison the flashes 
through my mind. I swear, if I had a way to destroy them all, I would.

&quot;No.&quot; I shake my head in disbelief. &quot;She won&#39;t go.&quot;

&quot;For her sake, I hope not.&quot; His look makes me uneasy. I remember what 
Droger said during our visit. Soldats comes before any single human.

&quot;If Mireille tries to join Droger-&quot; I can see the answer in his eyes and 
draw my breath sharply.

&quot;We will have no other recourse, Kirika. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</pre>
