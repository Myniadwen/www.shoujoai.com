<h1>Red and Black (part 1 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello! Well, it looks like it&#39;s big fanfic time once again. And you know 
what that means: lots of my ramblings about inconsequential things 
coupled with an excessive amount of smiley faces (^_^). Oh, and 
hopefully a decent story sandwiched in between that stuff.

This is a Noir fanfic, dealing with the Mireille/Kirika pairing. So it&#39;s 
shoujo-ai... with a possibility of quite explicit yuri. But don&#39;t worry, 
I&#39;ll tell you when yuri-licious material is about to come up. Also, 
expect a fair bit of graphic violence. Unlike in the series, there will 
be blood and gore. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, be prepared for some 
coarse language, possible drug use, and immoral characters engaging in 
equally immoral behaviour. What all that adds up to is an NC-17 rating. 
And the faint hearted better be careful too!

Some things in this chapter (events and thoughts) took place in my Noir 
one-shot, &#39;Black Turned Red&#39; also. However, I tried to word them 
differently. I did consider making the one-shot a prequel to this fic, 
but I didn&#39;t want Mireille and Kirika&#39;s relationship to have progressed 
so far.

Oh, and there are spoilers galore in this fanfic.

~This denotes translation~

** This fanfic is now uploaded on Mediaminer.org. Feel free to leave 
reviews there! ^_^

Now that all that stuff is out of the way, on with the fic...

******

Mireille Bouquet, with a glass of water in one hand and still dressed in 
her nightshirt, quietly walked over to where the new pot plant resided 
on a small, Walnut-coloured, square wooden end table beside one window 
of her apartment. The blonde, statuesque woman bent down and carefully 
poured the liquid from the glass around the plant&#39;s stalk, giving it its 
morning watering as either she or her partner did every day. The plant 
was an orchid, like its predecessor that had once sat on the table 
before it, but so far no flowers had bloomed... also like its 
predecessor. However, Mireille was not disheartened. Under her and her 
colleague&#39;s constant nurturing over the past few weeks, several buds had 
formed that could be found nestled in between the plant&#39;s broad green 
leaves--a sign of things to come. Mireille hoped that this time the 
orchid would flower brilliantly.

Mireille put the now empty glass on the table by the potted orchid, and 
then stood up straight with a sigh, placing her hands on her hips and 
admiring the plant. After returning to her home in Paris, France, she 
had felt a compulsion to replace the orchid that had been destroyed in a 
shootout within her apartment. If she were honest with herself, she knew 
where the desire had stemmed from. Tending to the plant had been a small 
but precious diversion she and her partner had shared in the past, and, 
she rather grudgingly supposed, she had wanted to recapture the pleasant 
and comfortable air of that joint activity again.

Mireille turned around to face the rest of the apartment and all of the 
other items that had been replaced following its redecoration courtesy 
of countless bullets fired by a score of white-masked Soldats hitmen. 
The repairs had taken just under a couple of weeks, and now it was as if 
the intense gunfight that had ravaged the place months earlier had never 
occurred at all. Smashed windows had been restored with new glass panes, 
and not a single blemish could be made out on any of the painstakingly 
patched and freshly painted walls. All of the bullet hole ridden 
furniture and appliances had been removed and replaced also, including 
Mireille&#39;s computer, and, oddly enough, the billiard table she used as a 
desk. The woman wasn&#39;t sure why exactly she hadn&#39;t simply bought a real 
desk instead; it wasn&#39;t as if anyone used the table to actually play 
pool.

Mireille looked around the living room, surveying the apartment&#39;s new 
and improved d&eacute;cor with satisfaction. The specialists she had hired to 
restore her home had done a good job--as they should have considering 
the amount of money the Corsican had paid for their services--and had 
also been very discreet. Mireille&#39;s landlord hadn&#39;t asked any questions 
about why her apartment needed a near total renovation either. Money 
could buy most people&#39;s silence... among other things. But it had helped 
that her landlord knew that Ms. Bouquet was not a woman one crossed 
lightly... or even willingly.

Mireille&#39;s blue gaze came to rest on the black wall that separated the 
living room from the bedroom, behind which the other permanent resident 
of her home currently was. Her partner, Kirika Yuumura, was evidently 
still fast asleep in the bedroom.

A ghost of a smile crept upon Mireille&#39;s features as she conjured up the 
endearing image of the darkhaired girl snoozing peacefully in their bed. 
Normally as soon as Mireille woke up Kirika awakened with her, or had 
already been wide-awake beforehand. Even when it appeared that she was 
in a deep slumber, looking as vulnerable and as frail as ever, Kirika 
remained alert--at least on a subconscious level. It was a throwback to 
her extensive training as an assassin, Mireille imagined.

However, Kirika had yet to fully recover from the gunshot wound to her 
side she had sustained at the Manor--a result of throwing herself in 
front of a bullet meant for Mireille--and so slept in late most 
mornings. Mireille&#39;s own injuries had merely consisted of scrapes and 
shallow knife puncture wounds, all of which had healed relatively 
quickly without scarring, but Kirika&#39;s singular wound had been much more 
serious than all of hers combined. The quiet girl was still not at a 
hundred percent and needed her rest, thus Mireille had silently slipped 
out of the bed they shared this morning, more than happy to let her 
sleep. And provide the semblance of a normal atmosphere--a normal way of 
life--for Kirika&#39;s sake.

Mireille&#39;s faint smile strengthened and became bemused as she thought 
about how much things had changed in her relationship with Kirika... and 
consequently in her own life, as well. In the past Mireille wouldn&#39;t 
have had much concern about Kirika&#39;s wellbeing whatsoever as long as the 
girl survived long enough to lead her to her abhorred quarry, Soldats, 
and aid her in finding the answers behind why her family had been 
murdered. But now ensuring that her partner had a calm and relaxed 
environment to recuperate to full health in was one of Mireille&#39;s 
highest priorities. She had to admit Kirika had become the most 
important thing in her life... and for someone as fiercely independent 
as Mireille; that was saying a great deal.

Mireille wasn&#39;t exactly sure how or even when Kirika had snuck her way 
into her cold heart, but as time went by, slowly yet surely the blonde&#39;s 
uncaring attitude towards the introverted girl had changed. The ice 
encasing the Corsican assassin&#39;s hard heart had melted gradually living 
and working with Kirika, so much so that when she had at last learned 
the awful truth behind her family&#39;s death and the time had come to make 
good on her promise to execute her &#39;temporary&#39; associate, she had 
faltered outright in doing so. Despite her pledge to kill Kirika when 
she was no longer useful, and even with the added incentive of the young 
assassin being the slayer of her parents and brother, Mireille hadn&#39;t 
been able to pull the trigger of her gun. At the very idea of ending 
Kirika&#39;s life Mireille&#39;s body had rebelled, and no matter what her mind 
had said she *should* be obligated to do, the stronger force of her 
warmed, thawed heart had stayed her hand.

Mireille had tried her utmost to resist warming up to Kirika any further 
when she had first realised her heart was softening to the quiet girl, 
but her efforts had been feeble and ultimately futile. Moreover, a part 
of Mireille--a part she hadn&#39;t liked to acknowledge at the time--hadn&#39;t 
really wanted to stop the growing changes between herself and Kirika. 
Mireille had never truly been close to anybody before after her hasty 
nocturnal leave-taking of Corsica--unless she counted her Uncle Claude 
when she was a child--and had been alone for many years following the 
end of her training in the ways of a contract killer. She had depended 
on no one but herself, *trusted* no one but herself. But being with 
Kirika had given her a taste of what it meant to share one&#39;s troubles 
and joys with another person... and Mireille had found it to her liking.

Nevertheless, Mireille had still went into a state of denial in regards 
to how she felt about Kirika, to such a degree that when her partner had 
left her side--or rather, had been abandoned by Mireille--the woman had 
resumed--or at least had attempted to resume--her prior lifestyle, and 
had tried to recapture her former independence. But it hadn&#39;t been that 
easy anymore. The absence of Kirika had left a hole in Mireille&#39;s life, 
and, if she were so inclined to admit, a hole in her heart as well. 
However, even with such a vast and bleak void inside of her, she had 
still tried to maintain her usual routine and forget about the Japanese 
girl she had once known and become so emotionally attached to.... But, 
thankfully, it wasn&#39;t meant to be.

Fearing what might happen in the future and knowing that a grim darkness 
lurked inside of her, Kirika had left behind a parting letter to 
Mireille, under the ruins of the orchid that had been so significant to 
both of them during the time they had spent together... although neither 
of them had ever stated the fact out loud. In that letter the withdrawn 
Kirika had confessed all of her feelings towards her blonde counterpart, 
plainly for the woman to see on paper. And when Mireille had read that 
letter, it had been enough to jolt her out of the delusion that she 
could simply forget about Kirika and return to her previous way of life. 
But even so, she had still used her right to fulfil her destiny and 
become Noir as an excuse to track down the missing girl; in spite of 
everything the--albeit weakening--denial of how she felt had still held 
fairly strong within her.

It hadn&#39;t been until the very end, until Kirika&#39;s life had been hanging 
by a thread, when Mireille had at last confronted the feelings that 
dwelled secretly within her heart. At that point, Kirika, thinking all 
her ties to the world gone, had been all but ready to die. It was then 
that Mireille had realised with crystal clear clarity that the girl&#39;s 
fate rested wholly in her hands. And so, the stubborn woman had finally 
let her mask of aloofness fall and had subsequently lowered herself to 
begging her partner to stay with her. Thankfully, it had been enough. 
Mireille had almost been too late, but with that tearful supplication 
Kirika had clung to her and in turn clung to life. At that moment 
Mireille had felt an overwhelming sense of relief in her heart and soul, 
of an intensity of such she had never experienced before. It was then 
she truly knew that Kirika meant everything to her; that she indeed was 
in love with the girl.

Once the two assassins had received professional--and 
surreptitious--medical treatment for their injuries in a town 
neighbouring the Manor and Kirika had recovered enough to travel, she 
and Mireille had returned home to Paris. But in spite of Mireille 
accepting the fact that she shared Kirika&#39;s feelings--or at the very 
least felt something romantically for her--not much was different in 
their relationship. Mireille was certainly enormously more affectionate 
towards Kirika now, but her fond gestures were limited to mere kind 
words and chaste touches. No affirmations of their feelings for one 
another had been exchanged either, and on Mireille&#39;s part, none ever had 
been uttered in the first place.

Mireille wasn&#39;t exactly sure why her relationship with Kirika had not 
progressed any further, but she had a feeling it was attributed to 
herself. Certainly, Mireille had made no effort to advance the 
relationship to an openly romantic level, and knowing Kirika, the 
introverted girl would follow her example and let her be in control, as 
usual. Was that it? Was Mireille simply waiting for Kirika to &#39;make a 
move&#39;, so to speak? It was a possibility, but the Corsican doubted it. 
She knew Kirika well, well enough to know that she would do nothing to 
forward their relationship until Mireille herself showed that she wished 
to. But if that were the case, then just what was holding Mireille back? 
Was she afraid of the commitment? No, ridiculous, considering she had 
been committed exclusively to Kirika for a considerable amount of time 
now. Perhaps it was because her partner was in actual fact responsible 
for the death of her family. Was Mireille troubled that her parents and 
brother were turning in their graves every time she let Kirika cuddle up 
close to her in bed at night? Did she believe that her heart was 
betraying their memory?

No. That was definitely not it. As soon as Mireille had learned that 
Kirika had been the one who had snuffed out her parents&#39; and brother&#39;s 
lives, the woman, in spite of herself, had instantly forgiven her, even 
if she hadn&#39;t been consciously aware of it at the time. Mireille&#39;s heart 
had already been a captive of Kirika&#39;s back then. Furthermore, she 
didn&#39;t even view Kirika as the killer of her family. That &#39;honour&#39; had 
been Altena&#39;s alone, who had wielded the girl when she was only a young 
child as a living, breathing instrument of murder--Kirika was a victim 
just as much as Mireille&#39;s family had been. Kirika had simply been a 
tool used by Altena... and the wicked Soldats follower had already paid 
for her crimes.

Whatever the reason for Mireille&#39;s seeming reluctance, she was 
comfortable with the way things were at the moment and she believed 
Kirika was too. She liked her current daily life. Her days were filled 
with peaceful times spent with Kirika, and she felt contentment with her 
existence that was completely new to her. Perhaps that was it; Mireille 
feared change, even if it were potentially for the better. She feared 
losing what she had already gained. Having a permanent partner, someone 
who even shared her living space, was quite a big step for the normally 
private woman. Mireille had never relied on or been emotionally close to 
anyone for a long, long while. Maybe all she needed was a little more 
time to grow used to the idea of having a genuine, stable, romantic 
relationship; more time to grow used to having a real... lover.

Mireille heaved a sigh and with a last glance in the direction of the 
bedroom, dismissed her reflections and walked over to the billiard table 
masquerading as a computer desk. She sat down in front of her PC and 
switched on the machine, hoping that the drone of it starting up would 
not disturb Kirika&#39;s sleep in the adjacent room. As soon as the 
computer&#39;s operating system had booted, Mireille logged onto the 
Internet and checked her secure email account. In her hazardous and 
illegal line of work, security and anonymity was imperative for 
continual business success. Mireille Bouquet was not only a beautiful 
woman living a life of privilege in Paris, but also one of the most 
reliable professional assassins in the criminal world. Of course, 
&#39;Mireille Bouquet&#39; had apparently dropped out of the business in recent 
months. She now used a new name... and had a partner.

As Mireille had suspected, several assignment propositions for her and 
Kirika--or more accurately, Noir--were waiting for her in her email 
inbox. She pursed her lips thoughtfully as her eyes scanned the subject 
headers of the emails, but then promptly frowned in irritation as she 
realised what she was doing. As she was about to delete all of the 
emails before she could do something she would definitely regret, she 
noticed that yet another message from the clandestine society, Soldats, 
was present. Mireille&#39;s irritation suddenly increased twofold. She 
didn&#39;t need to read the contents of the email to know what it contained; 
it wasn&#39;t the first time she had received it. Nor, did she imagine, 
would it be the last. Soldats, or more accurately, one high-ranking 
member of the organisation, Remy Breffort, sought a meeting with her. 
But for exactly what reason, Mireille didn&#39;t know. Or care, for that 
matter. She was done with Soldats, and she didn&#39;t want herself or Kirika 
to have any more involvement with them ever again.

Mireille deleted all of the emails along with Breffort&#39;s message, as was 
quickly becoming her morning ritual. Noir was no longer a part of 
Soldats; the sooner the man recognised that fact the better.

Mireille logged off of the Internet and leaned back in her chair, 
exhaling heavily, and stared up at the ceiling. She ignored the 
prospective jobs solely for the sake of Kirika. She hadn&#39;t even told her 
about the emails requesting their services she was regularly receiving, 
preferring to hide the knowledge from the still recuperating girl. 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s lives were peaceful--for the moment, at any 
rate--and the Corsican didn&#39;t want that other, darker life they had in 
common interfering with it. And she was positive Kirika didn&#39;t, either.

However, Mireille was also sure that she was only delaying the 
inevitable. She had willingly chosen to walk a black path in life, a 
black path filled with death--murder. Her life was that of an assassin, 
and nothing would change that; it was part of who she was. In truth, 
Mireille even missed the work. She had never had a problem with killing. 
Well, unless she considered the time in the graveyard with Kirika.... 
which she didn&#39;t.

But while Mireille had accepted that she would travel down a soiled, 
sinful path until the day she died, she felt differently in respect to 
Kirika. The diminutive girl was still young and yet she had probably 
seen more violence and murder than Mireille herself had. What Altena had 
exposed Kirika too, a mere child at the time.... Mireille ground her 
teeth and suppressed her rising anger. The fanatical Soldats member had 
damaged Kirika&#39;s mind with her immoral treatment. Another personality 
prowled inside of Mireille&#39;s normally rather shy counterpart, one that 
was as heartless as a pure cold-blooded killer. Mireille still 
remembered that persona... her eyes... her eyes had been devoid of 
feeling, of mercy... of life.

Yes, Mireille still remembered... and was still haunted by the memory of 
that other Kirika she had faced off with in the colosseum by the Manor. 
It was one of the primary reasons why she did her best to preserve a 
relaxed and normal atmosphere for herself and her partner to live in and 
enjoy. Kirika&#39;s short life had been full of bloodshed, so much so that 
the darkhaired girl had developed a defence mechanism in the form of 
another persona to cope with the horrors she had no doubt witnessed... 
and carried out herself. And Mireille was almost certain that the 
sinister personality still remained with Kirika. Thus, the blonde woman 
wanted to keep that other side of her partner repressed, and she hoped 
that an ordinary lifestyle would help to do that.

Moreover, Mireille believed that it was working. Kirika, while still 
relatively taciturn, appeared to be happy. At least she smiled a little 
more often now, as if she were a normal girl with no skills whatsoever 
in the art of murder. Sometimes, however, her unmatched combat abilities 
manifested themselves unconsciously. The manner in which she handled 
knives while doing everyday chores such as cooking came to mind, as well 
as the way she had of seeming to be as withdrawn as always when outside 
of the apartment, but at the same time constantly vigilant of any 
possible threats; a sort of relaxed readiness.

Mireille smiled wryly up at the ceiling, shaking her head slightly. She 
had never in a million years believed that she would end up living with 
a Japanese schoolgirl, who was also a fellow assassin with expertise 
even surpassing her own, and if that wasn&#39;t enough, fall in love with 
her too of all things. But now here she was, doing her utmost to protect 
the same girl and keep her happy. Love certainly made you do strange 
things.

&quot;Morning,&quot; a soft voice spoke in Japanese from a few feet in front of 
Mireille, bringing her out of her contemplations.

Mireille straightened in her chair to look at Kirika who was standing at 
the bottom of the steps that led to the bedroom. The two normally 
conversed in Japanese when they were alone together, which was 
practically all of the time. And living in Paris, where the majority of 
the population predominantly spoke in French, the voluntary language 
barrier gave Mireille and Kirika a sense of privacy even when in a crowd 
of people; their own little world where only the two of them existed. In 
actuality, they had always communicated in Japanese since they first 
met, only switching to French or another language when it was called 
for, customary for the sake of others. Perhaps it was because they had 
encountered each other in Japan in the beginning, and the practice of 
speaking in the country&#39;s native tongue had simply stuck. Mireille 
didn&#39;t know for sure, but whatever the habit&#39;s origin, her Japanese had 
certainly improved a great deal since meeting Kirika.

&quot;Ah, so you&#39;re finally awake, sleepy head,&quot; Mireille teased at the sight 
of Kirika, the girl looking quite dishevelled from sleeping, with her 
dark locks tousled wildly and her vest and shorts that made up her 
nightwear creased and twisted. It painted a positively adorable picture 
in Mireille&#39;s eyes, one she hadn&#39;t been able to resist commenting on. 
But then she did often nowadays take pleasure in poking light-hearted 
fun at poor Kirika. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to go back to bed? It 
*is* still early...&quot; Mireille went on, but only half-joking this time, 
aware that the recuperating girl required her rest.

Kirika lowered her head and looked at Mireille though her bangs, a 
small, rueful smile forming on her features in response to the woman&#39;s 
ribbing. She then shook her head, the action accompanied by a cute sound 
in the negative; one of many idiosyncrasies that Mireille found 
endearing.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Mireille said, pushing her chair back from the billiard table 
on its wheels. &quot;How are you feeling today? Come here so I can check how 
you&#39;re progressing.&quot;

Kirika dutifully walked over to the blonde and stood in front of her 
chair. &quot;I feel better,&quot; she quietly informed Mireille as the woman 
lifted the bottom of her vest to inspect the injury beneath, &quot;but I&#39;m 
still tired.&quot;

Mireille nodded absently at Kirika&#39;s report while she studied the 
gunshot wound in her partner&#39;s side. It appeared to have finally healed 
up completely, leaving behind only the faintest of scars. Mireille 
reached up and gingerly traced the mark with one fingertip, her touch 
feather-light on the darkhaired girl&#39;s silky-smooth skin. Every time she 
saw the wound it brought back the unpleasant memory of Kirika 
intercepting Altena&#39;s bullet with her own body in an act of 
selflessness. But at the same time, it was a reminder of the extent of 
Kirika&#39;s feelings for Mireille--a testament of her love. It always 
filled Mireille with a sense of... wonder, that someone cared that much 
about her to make such a self-sacrificing gesture.

Mireille blinked as it dawned on her that she had ceased circling the 
scar and was now using her whole hand to rub--or rather, 
caress--Kirika&#39;s taut stomach with gentle strokes. Acutely aware that 
Kirika had stopped breathing, she abruptly halted the motions of her 
wayward hand and looked up at the girl, only to meet rapt reddish-brown 
eyes with her own apprehensive blue ones. Somewhat guiltily, Mireille 
drew back her hand and let Kirika&#39;s vest fall back into place before 
dropping her gaze and forcing a cough, seeking a means to dispel the 
awkward moment, although she wasn&#39;t sure why she felt it was one.

&quot;You... you seem to be recovering fine,&quot; Mireille said, her voice a 
little hoarse. &quot;After a few more days of rest you should be perfectly 
fit.&quot;

Kirika said nothing and merely nodded, her countenance now one of her 
usual subdued expressions.

&quot;But in the meantime, I want to go shopping,&quot; Mireille continued, her 
tone becoming more blithe as she snatched onto something lighter to talk 
about. &quot;*Clothes* shopping...&quot; she then elaborated, her expression 
turning considerably sly as she ran her eyes over Kirika&#39;s lithe figure, 
pretending to size her up.

Kirika blinked a couple of times and then swallowed a bit 
uneasily--Mireille knew that she understood what going clothes shopping 
meant. Mireille loved pampering Kirika, especially with material things. 
Her favourite form of indulgence was buying new clothes for her reticent 
partner. She simply adored using the slip of a girl as a model for her 
to play dress-up with. Fortunately, Kirika stoically consented to 
Mireille&#39;s little pleasure... although with a mildly noticeable lack of 
enthusiasm... that the blonde summarily ignored, needless to say.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; Kirika said, almost whining out the woman&#39;s name, and with 
a tiny hint of longsuffering in her soft voice.

Mireille merely smiled, implicitly knowing that Kirika would concede to 
her wishes, and also relishing the way the Japanese girl said her name. 
Mireille wasn&#39;t sure if it was because of her accent or just another one 
of her quirks, but Kirika had a unique and exquisite way of pronouncing 
her name. It was like her sweet tongue caressed each and every syllable 
of the Corsican&#39;s name in a special and intimate fashion as it left her 
lips, and it always served to send a trill of delight through Mireille. 
She doubted she would ever grow weary of hearing the enchanting sound.

Mireille took the hem of one leg of Kirika&#39;s shorts between a finger and 
a thumb and rubbed it thoughtfully. &quot;Hmm...&quot; she murmured with false 
deliberation, &quot;I think you could use more shorts. And perhaps some new 
pyjamas as well.&quot; Mireille did her best to restrain the smile that 
threatened to spoil her mock serious examination of her partner&#39;s 
clothing. She had a feeling that today was going to be an entertaining 
one... for her, at least.

&quot;Pyjamas?&quot; Kirika parroted somewhat uncertainly, as she blinked again 
and looked down at her clothes.

******

Mireille took a sip of her frothy cappuccino and then settled back in 
her plush seat with a content sigh, savouring the flavour of her 
beverage. She and her virtually inseparable companion, Kirika, who was 
seated across from her, were in a private booth located in one of the 
many caf&eacute;s scattered along the streets of Paris, the pair taking a short 
respite from their enjoyable--yet quite exhausting--shopping expedition 
for lunch. A dozen glossy bags overflowing with designer clothes ranging 
from skirts to socks purchased from a variety of exclusive boutiques 
were crammed next to Kirika at her side of the booth, all of which the 
slender girl had carried herself. Mireille did feel a tiny bit guilty 
about her own... well, laziness to put it bluntly. More often than not 
she allowed Kirika to do just about all of the menial tasks that filled 
their normal daily lives, such as hauling grocery bags and luggage 
around, as well as setting and washing tableware. In the past, the woman 
had eventually wound up viewing her partner as sort of a little 
&#39;servant&#39;; or in other words, someone to do all the jobs she herself 
didn&#39;t like doing... and old habits apparently died hard. Mireille 
frequently slipped into her domineering role even though the nature of 
her relationship with Kirika was now... at least somewhat different, 
permitting the compliant girl to do most of the chores inside and 
outside their apartment. And it didn&#39;t help that Kirika never ever 
protested the treatment and even seemed glad to be devotedly lending a 
hand, regardless of how hard she toiled as a result. However, she did 
assist the girl when they cooked at home, Mireille thought defensively, 
squirming a little in her seat. That was *something*, wasn&#39;t it?

Nearly every garment contained within each of the shopping bags 
alongside Kirika had been graciously--yet also slightly 
reluctantly--modelled by the pretty darkhaired girl for her older 
partner&#39;s own personal gratification. The corners of Mireille&#39;s full 
lips twitched and then curled upwards into a small smile as she recalled 
the memory of Kirika wearing one of her new sets of silk pyjamas. They 
were a little baggy on her, almost swallowing her diminutive frame 
completely in their folds, but that had only added to the whole cute and 
lovable vision. Mireille had prudently stayed away from choosing any new 
undergarments for her, however. Strangely, for some reason the idea of 
making Kirika pose in her underwear made Mireille a tad uncomfortable.

Mireille brought her coffee cup to her lips and watched Kirika over its 
rim as the girl, dressed in one of her newly acquired outfits she had 
changed into earlier under her partner&#39;s &#39;suggestion&#39;, idly picked at 
the remains of her ham and cheese croissant, pushing the remnants around 
on her plate. She looked distant, as if something were on her mind, 
perhaps even troubling her.

Mireille&#39;s face fell a little and she took another drink of her 
cappuccino to hide the expression. Kirika often retreated into her own 
private world; she had even done so in the past, when she and the 
Corsican had first met--Mireille remembered when the quiet girl would 
stare out of one of the apartment&#39;s windows at seemingly nothing for 
hours at a time.

Mireille frequently wondered what Kirika ruminated on during those 
withdrawn periods of hers, appearing totally detached from her 
surroundings. She sometimes considered simply asking her, but she 
doubted even she would get a straight answer from the reticent girl, or 
at least one that would satisfy her. Looking at Kirika now while she 
gazed vacantly out the large front window of the caf&eacute; their booth was 
adjacent to, the leftovers of her lunch forgotten, Mireille thought she 
looked rather sad as well as distant. Of course that wasn&#39;t saying too 
much considering that her normal everyday expression was usually 
melancholic. But after having lived with Kirika for the better part of a 
year now, Mireille could generally tell how her brooding partner was 
feeling on the inside. She had learnt that using Kirika&#39;s lovely brown 
eyes to determine her emotional state was the easiest and most accurate 
method. Her eyes were so expressive, soulful, and they seemed to speak 
volumes--poignant words poured straight from her heart... well, poured 
straight to Mireille at any rate. And right at this very moment, 
Kirika&#39;s brown orbs said clearly to the blonde that something was 
definitely bothering her. Mireille sighed softly. She wished Kirika were 
able to share her problems with her.

But instead of confronting Kirika on her evident preoccupation, Mireille 
plucked a random topic of conversation out of the air, feeling that she 
had to say something, even if its subject matter was in essence 
basically small talk.

After taking one last sip of her coffee, Mireille put her cup down with 
an exaggerated breath, smacking her lips. &quot;After lunch why don&#39;t we go 
shopping for more clothes?&quot; she piped up, placing her elbows on the 
table and propping her head in her hands as she looked at Kirika.

Kirika turned away from the view of bustling people and heavy traffic 
outside the caf&eacute;&#39;s window at the sound of Mireille&#39;s cheerful voice, 
roused from her private thoughts. She favoured Mireille with a glance 
before flicking her eyes to the mound of boutique bags beside her for a 
second, and then directed a questioning look at the keen blonde.

&quot;Oh no, not for you. I believe you have more than enough outfits,&quot; 
Mireille clarified, but not before furtively adding, &quot;...for the time 
being.&quot; Somehow she managed to contain the large grin that wanted to 
burst out on her face at the sight of a fairly nervous-looking Kirika.

&quot;No, you&#39;ve had all the fun thus far and now it&#39;s my turn,&quot; Mireille 
quickly continued, before leaning forward conspiringly towards her 
partner, a faint smile on her features. &quot;And this time, *I&#39;ll* be *your* 
model,&quot; she whispered with a playful wink as her smile turned more than 
a little seductive.

Kirika simply stared at Mireille for a moment, her steady gaze only 
broken by several languid blinks, but she then nodded eagerly while 
making her patented peep of approval. She smiled shyly at Mireille and 
then started to open her mouth to say something, but stopped suddenly as 
her eyes shifted to the right of the blonde woman, her countenance 
returning to its fundamentally emotionless mask.

Mireille blinked and then followed Kirika&#39;s gaze to her left, meeting a 
waiter&#39;s apologetic eyes. The assassin frowned in irritation at having 
her banter with her colleague rudely interrupted and then sat back 
properly in her seat, glaring coldly at the now even more remorseful 
waiter.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mireille snapped in French as she folded her arms, quite 
annoyed... and inwardly a little embarrassed at having been caught 
stretched over halfway across the table to Kirika. She was suddenly very 
glad she spoke in Japanese to her.

The waiter, obviously flustered by the imposing woman&#39;s ire, stumbled 
over his words for a few seconds, his eyes occasionally darting to an 
apathetic Kirika as if she could somehow help him out of his 
predicament, before finally informing Mireille that he had been asked to 
deliver a note to her and her friend&#39;s table. He brandished the crisp 
white envelope in his hand for further emphasis whilst smiling 
sheepishly.

Mireille deftly snatched the envelope from the waiter&#39;s grasp before he 
could even react in the slightest, and then examined it carefully. One 
could never be too cautious in her line of work. While Mireille may not 
have been actively accepting contracts for a couple of months now, it 
didn&#39;t mean she had become stupid or sloppy. Indeed, her handbag next to 
her contained a fully loaded Walther P99, her firearm of choice. The 
idea of not taking her weapon when she left the safe haven of her 
apartment was simply foreign to Mireille. It was better to be safe than 
sorry; who knew when an old memory with a score to settle would somehow 
track her down? Besides, between her and Kirika only she carried a 
firearm now--the girl hadn&#39;t replaced her last gun after it had burnt up 
with Altena in the volcanic cavern below the Manor. And for the moment, 
Mireille intended to keep it that way. If Kirika carried a gun it would 
only serve to dispel the happy and peaceful atmosphere she currently 
lived in--the heavy burden of a lethal weapon almost constantly by her 
side put a damper on even Mireille&#39;s spirits nowadays; she didn&#39;t want 
to think what it would do to her poor brooding partner&#39;s. But by all 
means Kirika wasn&#39;t defenceless without a firearm; even unarmed she was 
a devastating opponent. Her combat skills were beyond the scope of most 
people&#39;s even much older than she, including those who had dedicated 
their whole lives to warfare. Kirika was a living weapon.

&quot;Who asked you to deliver this?&quot; Mireille queried the waiter as she 
continued with her inspection of the letter.

&quot;Er, I don&#39;t know. The manager just told me to take it to you,&quot; the 
waiter replied, shrugging.

On the front face of the envelope in Mireille&#39;s hands was simply her 
full name, written in long, flowing script. The envelope itself was 
thin, and Mireille doubted that any sort of explosive could have been 
hidden inside. That didn&#39;t rule out the presence of a biological agent, 
though. The Corsican assassin gingerly brought the envelope up to her 
nose and surreptitiously sniffed it, trying to detect any telltale 
odours of a chemical weapon or poison soaked into the paper within... 
and without exposing herself to it. Needless to say, if the envelope 
itself were contaminated, it would be far too late. But since the waiter 
hadn&#39;t keeled over just yet, Mireille had assumed the note was safe to 
touch.

&quot;You&#39;re still here...?&quot; Mireille said pointedly to the lingering waiter 
as she finished her investigation. She maintained her attention on the 
mysterious envelope however, under the alert gaze of Kirika, and the 
baffled gaze of the now startled waiter. &quot;Find out who is responsible 
for this letter,&quot; the assassin ordered the man, opting to give him more 
than a hint to what action he should be taking.

&quot;Uhh, of course, I was just... umm,&quot; the waiter spluttered, searching 
for an excuse for his loitering. However, after seeing that Mireille had 
already dismissed him from her mind, he gave up and walked away, all the 
while muttering something under his breath about prissy women and their 
uptight attitudes. Mireille, although catching his parting remarks, paid 
them no heed--she was more concerned about the envelope. Besides, to her 
knowledge there was no contract out on the discourteous waiter. It would 
have been a waste of bullets and money to teach him some respect--if she 
shot every person impolite to her or simply incompetent, she would have 
went out of business long ago.

&quot;It seems clean,&quot; Mireille said to Kirika in Japanese once the waiter 
was out of earshot--just to be safe--and looked up from the note.

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika mumbled in the affirmative. She looked down at the envelope 
in her colleague&#39;s hand and then raised her head to look the woman in 
the eye, silently asking the question that was dancing on Mireille&#39;s own 
tongue.

Deciding to alleviate her and her partner&#39;s curiosity, Mireille 
carefully opened the letter, and after nothing untoward happened, she 
delicately pulled out its contents between her thumb and forefinger. The 
envelope had contained a single sheet of folded paper, which Mireille 
now warily opened. Her brow creased in irritation and all worry left her 
as she scanned the familiar text that was written on the paper, which 
she had read numerous times in the form of emails received on her 
computer, before her expression turned into an all out scowl when she 
came to the signature at the end of the message. Breffort. Naturally. 
Did he really think that signing his own name rather than the group he 
belonged to made his message more appealing to her?

Mireille&#39;s eyes narrowed to dangerous slits as she crushed the note in 
her hand, conscious of the concerned look she was getting from her 
oblivious partner. And how dare Breffort disturb her and Kirika&#39;s peace. 
Messages in her private email account were one thing, but a letter 
delivered out in the open, and in front of Kirika no less.... Soldats. 
How Mireille hated those who supposedly &#39;held the world&#39;.

&quot;Mireille...?&quot; Kirika questioned uncertainly as Mireille sharply 
half-rose from her seat, the woman&#39;s eyes darting around the caf&eacute;, 
searching for any suspicious character that stood out and could have 
been responsible for relaying the note.

Mireille&#39;s questing eyes caught the waiter&#39;s who had presented the 
letter. The uniformed man started at her piercing blue glare, almost 
dropping the tray laden with full drinking glasses he was carrying, but 
then recovered with only a splash of soda on his white shirt. With one 
minutely shaking hand he pointed to his right, giving a wan smile to 
Mireille as he did so.

The assassin snapped her head in the direction of the waiter&#39;s finger, 
and saw that he was indicating an immaculately garbed man in a black 
suit and tie who was striding calmly yet swiftly across the floor of the 
caf&eacute;, heading for the front door--doubtless he was the individual who 
had asked the manager of the establishment to deliver Breffort&#39;s message 
to Mireille and Kirika&#39;s table. Judging by his shifty apparel, 
reminiscent of many a Soldats minion the blonde and her companion had 
slain, as well as his unmistakable enthusiasm to vacate the premises, 
Mireille was absolutely positive that he worked for the secret society.

Mireille mentally bit off a curse, grabbed her handbag, and then hurried 
after the Soldats courier as he reached the entrance of the caf&eacute; and 
opened the glass door, leaving the building. The Corsican, a moment 
behind him, threw open the caf&eacute; door and stepped out onto the footpath 
outside, just in time to see the darkly dressed man quickly open the 
rear passenger door of an equally darkly painted sedan parked across 
from her in the street. He obviously knew she was on to him.

Mireille dashed forwards, hoping to intercept the Soldats agent before 
he climbed into the safety of the black vehicle, but was rudely halted 
in her tracks as she bumped into a passer by. Mireille turned angrily to 
give a brief grimace of annoyance to the bad-mannered man she had 
knocked into--he hadn&#39;t even given a semblance of an apology!--but only 
caught a glimpse of shoulder length stark white hair and the back of a 
long jet black coat before he blended into the swarms of people 
travelling along the footpath.

Hearing a car door slam shut jerked Mireille&#39;s attention back to the 
ebony sedan, and to the woman&#39;s disgust she saw that her momentary 
distraction had been enough to allow the Soldats messenger to escape. 
She scrunched the letter still held in her left hand into a tighter 
ball. She was sure there would be other Soldats couriers in the future 
to relay her own message; one way or another Breffort would learn of her 
displeasure at being hounded.

All of a sudden Mireille was hurled backwards through the air by a 
tremendous explosion, originating from the sedan that had erupted into a 
huge ball of flame, fiery tendrils reaching out to consume the footpath 
and most of the street as well. Mireille felt the intense heat of the 
blast along with its force on her body as she smashed through the glass 
pane of the caf&eacute;&#39;s entrance at the same time the entire front window of 
the restaurant was blown inwards, showering patrons inside with a deluge 
of sharp shards.

Mireille lay on her back, staring up at the caf&eacute;&#39;s partially blackened 
ceiling, its cream coloured paint now streaked with scorch marks. Her 
body felt numb and she could hear a faint ringing in her ears... but 
that was all. Kirika&#39;s anxious face suddenly appeared above Mireille, 
the girl&#39;s lips moving rapidly, but all the blonde could do was blink 
stupidly up at her in response, hearing nothing. However, as she 
continued to simply stare at Kirika, the ringing in her ears gradually 
became more perceptible, the ringing turning into a piercing shriek, 
almost as if she was being exposed to a steadily mounting high frequency 
soundwave, until--

&quot;--reille?! Mireille?!&quot; Kirika&#39;s fretful voice cut into Mireille&#39;s 
hearing without warning, the buzzing in her ears fading until it 
disappeared beyond audible range. Mireille was glad the explosion had 
not damaged her eardrums. Unfortunately, sensation had also returned to 
her body. She had forgotten how much it hurt to be flung through solid 
glass.

&quot;I&#39;m... alright,&quot; Mireille assured her concerned partner in a croaky 
voice as she struggled to sit up, mindful of the doubtless myriad of 
jagged glass flakes she was lying on. Her back ached something fierce, 
and she was sure she had sustained numerous cuts and bruises, but she 
didn&#39;t think she had broken anything.

Kirika helped Mireille sit up with tentatively placed hands, her support 
careful yet helpful. The blonde flashed her considerate colleague a 
grateful smile, and then reached her right hand up to touch her head, 
only to realise that somehow she had managed to keep a hold of her 
handbag despite being violently propelled like a rag doll into the caf&eacute; 
through its front door. Mireille was pleased. Even when rocked by an 
explosion, being forcibly parted from one&#39;s weapon was unacceptable for 
a professional assassin. The danger to one&#39;s person didn&#39;t necessarily 
stop when the explosions did.

With Kirika&#39;s assistance, Mireille clambered unsteadily to her feet, 
accompanied by a tinkle of shattered glass that had stuck to her back 
falling like glittering dewdrops to the floor. The woman took her time 
to assess the destruction... and piece together what could have 
happened. Wisps of flame billowed through the destroyed front window of 
the caf&eacute;, with the remaining ragged glass attached along the edges of 
the frame giving the impression of a huge gaping maw breathing fire. 
Turning her gaze outside, Mireille saw the blazing skeleton of the 
Soldats car, the vehicle utterly gutted to a charred wreck. The still 
raging fires hid most of the chassis&#39; interior, but she was sure she 
could make out two well-cooked bodies inside. It appeared that 
Breffort&#39;s messenger and his associate had not escaped after all.

But the two Soldats agents weren&#39;t the only casualties by far. Littering 
the street were several corpses--or soon to be corpses--simply people in 
the wrong place at the wrong time who had caught the brunt of the blast. 
There were even more than a few victims inside the caf&eacute;, some of them 
horribly wounded and unmoving unfortunates sprawled on the floor, having 
been thrown through the front window from the footpath outside, while 
others who had been sitting next to the window had been badly cut by 
flying glass as well as scorched by searing flames. All in all the 
fatalities of the car bomb, if indeed that was what it had been, were 
extensive. Mireille had been extremely lucky to avoid serious injury.

On seeing the booth where she and Kirika had only had lunch minutes 
before now a melted mess, Mireille turned worriedly to the girl.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked, consciously keeping all but a little 
concern out of her voice.

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika nodded, her eyes flicking to their demolished table and 
then back to Mireille, understanding. &quot;I followed behind you.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Mireille said, quite calmly, but with relief welling up inside 
of her. If Kirika had remained in her seat, she didn&#39;t want to imagine 
what could have happened.

Mireille noticed that all of the new clothes she had bought for Kirika 
had also been ruined beyond all recognition. And while the sight rankled 
Mireille&#39;s nerves--some of those outfits she had really wanted to see 
Kirika in again! Well, they could always go on more clothes shopping 
trips--right now that was the least of their problems. Someone had taken 
out two Soldats agents--Breffort&#39;s agents. Why? Infighting in the 
organisation perhaps? A little internal strife? It was feasible, but 
without further information all Mireille had was speculation.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika said, her soft voice interrupting the woman&#39;s 
musings.

Mireille looked at Kirika, and saw her partner lower her brown eyes 
pointedly to her left hand. The Corsican followed her gaze, suddenly 
aware of the crumpled paper she still held. Evidently she had managed to 
retain her grasp on that too. Mireille lifted her left hand and frowned 
at the letter in it. Had the Soldats courier and his driver died because 
of this note? But it was only a simple message, one merely requesting 
that Mireille contact and meet with Breffort as soon as possible, just 
like all the emails before it. Was that worth killing two people and who 
knew how many innocent bystanders in the process? It didn&#39;t add up.

Police and ambulance sirens could be heard wailing in the distance; they 
would soon be here. It was long past time to be gone. Mireille certainly 
didn&#39;t want to be caught up in answering questions asked by the 
authorities, especially with a gun in her handbag. Besides, something 
had happened here today that didn&#39;t sit well with her, which may even 
involve her and Kirika. And she intended to find out what.

******

It was dusk by the time Mireille arrived back at the apartment building. 
For the remainder of the day, after a short visit back home following 
the car bombing, she had been out on the streets--the backstreets 
mostly--of Paris, seeing what she could learn from her usual 
rumourmongers who normally kept their ear to the ground regarding events 
in the underworld and the circumstances behind them, no matter how 
significant or trivial. She had been to see many people, some less 
scrupulous than others, and after loosening tongues with cash incentives 
and filtering out the illogical hearsay and fervent personal beliefs, 
the solid facts she had gathered all said more or less the same thing. 
An unexpected and disquieting thing.

Mireille trudged up the apartment building&#39;s flight of stairs to the 
first floor, lugging her yellow scooter with some difficultly beside 
her. Normally Kirika would do such labour for her, but on the Corsican&#39;s 
insistence, the obliging girl had remained behind at home. Mireille had 
cited it would be faster for her to zip around town collecting 
information by herself using her scooter. However, there had also been 
another reason why the assassin had wanted Kirika to stay in the 
apartment, one she hadn&#39;t told her. While it was obviously safer to wait 
in the security of their home, the main reason was that Mireille hadn&#39;t 
wanted Kirika&#39;s quiet and peaceful atmosphere to be harmed anymore than 
it had already been with the carnage at the caf&eacute;. The majority of the 
individuals the blonde had consulted were not the most... honest of 
people, to put it lightly. In truth, a good number were hardened 
criminals. Even in broad daylight, a woman and a girl alone in a seedy 
part of the city made tempting targets, especially with the well-to-do 
manner Mireille carried herself with. Of course, anybody who tried 
anything would have regretted it for the rest of his or her suddenly 
drastically shortened life, but the violence that would inevitably break 
out would undoubtedly extinguish whatever shred of tranquillity and 
believability Kirika&#39;s happy and normal living environment still had. 
Mireille would maintain the fa&ccedil;ade of an ordinary and serene way of life 
for as long as she could for Kirika&#39;s sake. Not until the bullets were 
flying in their direction would she finally concede that their black 
pasts had finally caught up with them, staining the light they lived in 
with darkness.

Mireille grunted in quite an unladylike fashion as she at last struggled 
up to the top of the staircase hauling her heavy load. It had been a 
long time since Mireille had last utilised her scooter before today. It 
was designed for only one person to ride, and now that she was no longer 
living alone indefinitely, she hadn&#39;t had much use for it. It was very 
rare when Mireille left the apartment without Kirika by her side, today 
notwithstanding, and the pair usually either walked to their destination 
or took a taxicab. They sometimes took advantage of the Metro, the 
subway system that ran beneath Paris like a subterranean spider&#39;s web, 
but only if pressed. Mireille preferred the privacy of a cab and was 
more than willing to pay for it.

But perhaps it was time for her to trade in her faithful yellow scooter 
for something that allowed more passengers. A car maybe, or even an 
actual motorbike. Mireille smiled at the thought of cruising around the 
streets of Paris on a juiced up motorbike with Kirika riding behind her; 
the girl&#39;s arms wrapped tightly around her waist while she snuggled into 
her back, naturally. Mireille wasn&#39;t really a big fan of motorbikes, but 
it certainly would be a lot of fun, and not to mention a great deal 
better than walking.

Mireille reached the apartment she shared with Kirika at the end of the 
hall and unlocked the door and entered, wheeling her scooter inside. As 
she walked into the living room, she saw Kirika sitting at the computer 
on the billiard table, watching TV on its monitor. A report on the car 
bombing outside the caf&eacute; was showing on the PC&#39;s screen, the channel set 
to a local news station that the darkhaired girl was regarding intently. 
However, she turned her attention to Mireille as the woman trundled her 
scooter past her to park it in its usual spot by the window, but not 
before then, somehow implicitly distinguishing that her partner had 
returned to the apartment and not an intruder instead without so much as 
looking in her direction. Mireille wondered how Kirika did it.

&quot;What are they saying?&quot; Mireille inquired as she walked over to the 
billiard table and casually tossed her handbag with her Walther P99 
inside on it.

&quot;It&#39;s being said that it was a car bomb and that there have been a total 
of seven deaths so far. There have been over a dozen injuries, too. Some 
are critical. The two men that were inside the car haven&#39;t been 
identified yet,&quot; Kirika said, knowing that Mireille was referring to the 
news stations she had occupied herself with viewing while left alone. 
&quot;No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the reporters 
are saying that it could be gang related.&quot;

Mireille nodded. It was merely the bare essentials, the most basic of 
facts. The assassin had anticipated as much. It was natural for the 
media. It was uncommon when they actually got it right when it involved 
the underworld, and this time with Soldats involvement, it was doubly 
unlikely the news stations would.

There was silence between Mireille and Kirika for a few moments, and the 
blonde woman was acutely aware of the expectant look she was receiving 
from her partner. But Mireille wasn&#39;t very eager to disclose what she 
had discovered to Kirika. Her eyes went to Breffort&#39;s creased note that 
was lying flattened out on the green surface of the billiard table, next 
to the computer. Kirika hadn&#39;t asked whether or not it was the first 
message Mireille had gotten from the high-ranking Soldats member, and 
the Corsican hadn&#39;t told her either. It was better to keep that fact 
secret Mireille had decided; she wasn&#39;t sure how the generally stoic 
girl would take her duplicity. But in Mireille&#39;s eyes, it wasn&#39;t really 
duplicity. More like withholding the whole truth. It had been for 
Kirika&#39;s sake anyway; that made it justified, didn&#39;t it?

Mireille exhaled heavily. Kirika still hadn&#39;t said anything, but the 
silence between them was deafening. She could practically feel the 
girl&#39;s brown gaze on her, waiting patiently for her report. There was no 
prompting on Kirika&#39;s part, just quiet tolerance, noiselessly waiting 
for her to say something. Somehow that mute patience seemed to demand 
that Mireille speak more than encouraging words would have.

&quot;I&#39;ve found out something,&quot; Mireille finally admitted with some 
reluctance, &quot;not much, but something.&quot; She looked up from the crumpled 
letter to meet Kirika&#39;s expressive eyes. &quot;The word going around is 
that...&quot; She paused for a second, knowing the impact this would have on 
their quiet existence. Perhaps she just wanted to soak up the remaining 
peacefulness for one single moment longer.

Mireille swallowed and then sighed, before continuing. &quot;The word is that 
the car bombing was... was Noir&#39;s doing.&quot; She stopped for an instant to 
let it sink into the girl, and also for her to gauge Kirika&#39;s reaction. 
But Mireille&#39;s taciturn colleague simply blinked, nothing more. Sighing 
once again, Mireille went on with her report. &quot;Supposedly Noir has 
returned to Europe after a few months hiatus. Either that, or they are 
back in business.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t the first time someone else other than Mireille and Kirika had 
claimed to be Noir. Indeed, the duo had met Chloe, the self-proclaimed 
&#39;True Noir&#39;, that way. Many contract killers in the underworld had taken 
on the title before Mireille and Kirika, and with the pair apparently 
vanished from the scene, some ambitious individual or individuals who 
believed they had the expertise to back up the name had taken advantage 
of their absence. Or at any rate, that appeared to be the case.

&quot;Noir...&quot; Kirika suddenly whispered, as if the word held special 
significance.... which in truth it did. She stared off into space as she 
spoke the feared title of the greatest assassin, or rather, pair of 
assassins in the business, seeming lost in thought. She then abruptly 
blinked, snapping out of her reverie, and her eyes moved to the letter 
resting atop the billiard table at the same time Mireille&#39;s did.

Mireille had no doubt what was running through her own mind was running 
through Kirika&#39;s as well. With the grapevine proclaiming that Noir had 
detonated the car bomb outside the caf&eacute;, it was likely that Breffort 
would believe that Mireille and Kirika were responsible for the deaths 
of his agents, and had performed an act of hostility against Soldats, 
effectively declaring war. While Mireille had no love for the group, she 
didn&#39;t want to go head to head against their entire force, or even 
solely against Breffort&#39;s own. Who knew how many belonged to the 
cloak-and-dagger society? It would be like fighting against the whole 
world--not a fight Mireille was raring to rush into, or to have Kirika 
engaged in either. Between the two of them they had killed an 
incalculable number of Soldats agents, but unbeknownst to them at the 
time, it had been during controlled conditions. The skirmishes had been 
tests, mere trials to see if they were worthy of becoming Noir. Going 
against a completely unleashed Soldats would be a very different 
experience.

So there was no choice. Even if just to assure Breffort that she and 
Kirika weren&#39;t to blame for the attack on Soldats, Mireille would have 
to meet with the man. It seemed he would finally get his much sought 
after meeting in spite of everything. But whatever he had to say, 
Mireille didn&#39;t care. She would go only to pledge her and Kirika&#39;s 
innocence, nothing more. She flat out refused to become embroiled in 
some Soldats plot, dragging along her partner for the ride too. Kirika 
was still recovering from her injuries sustained at the Manor; she 
didn&#39;t need anything more to worry about.

Mireille&#39;s shoulders sagged as she closed her eyes, shutting out the 
sight of Breffort&#39;s note. Regardless of her intentions, there was a good 
chance that simply conceding to Breffort&#39;s wishes spelt the end of her 
and Kirika&#39;s peaceful lifestyle. Or perhaps, the woman thought sadly, it 
was already at its end.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

And so it begins. Finally! ^_^ This was a fairly long first chapter, but 
I had to reintroduce some things mentioned in &#39;Black Turned Red&#39;. I hope 
it is okay, and that the story will flesh out to something decent and 
entertaining.

The sounds Kirika makes when saying yes or no (those little mumbles) are 
more or less Japanese, but I figured Mireille wouldn&#39;t know exactly.

Oh, and yes, Mireille&#39;s PC (the original and this new one) does in fact 
have a TV antenna. Yes, really. ^_^</pre>
