<h1>The Darkness in Their Eyes (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rtraverse.html">Rune Traverse</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The story itself came to mind while I was doing research for Le Deux 
Retour and started taking note of the &quot;True Noir&quot; eyestyles. This 
special style is the way Chloe&#39;s eyes are always drawn, and Kirika&#39;s 
eyes are done in this style when she is in her &#39;True Noir&#39; mindset, 
especially near the end of the series and during her battle with Mirelle 
at the Manor. I always found this &#39;signal&#39; of Kirika&#39;s mental state 
interesting, and after hearing Mirelle&#39;s comment of &quot;I have a little 
Noir in me, too&quot; in the last episode, I wondered if there was a similar 
type of situation or trigger for Mirelle. After watching all twenty-six 
episodes again, I found several moments where Mirelle actually does gain 
the True Noir style &#150; and amazingly enough, most of them happen when 
Kirika is in physical or mental danger that doesn&#39;t relate to their job, 
or when she is faced with Chloe, her &#39;rival&#39; for Kirika&#39;s affections. 
Which, when combined with my perverted muse, resulted in this &#39;what if?&#39; 
little story. The rating comes for later chapters, which will contain 
shojo-ai and some yuri. The pairing is Mirelle / Kirika, if anyone 
hasn&#39;t guessed it yet.

Note: Yes, I know the Japanese spelling of Artena&#39;s name is &#150; obviously 
&#150; done with an &quot;r.&quot; The use of Altena is a personal choice because it 
sounds better in my head, so I tend to type it that way.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Kssssshhhhh &#150;

Mirelle Bouquet &#150; one half of the legendary assassin team known as Noir 
&#150; stood naked beneath the shower&#39;s warm, thundering spray, luxuriating 
in the steamy heat that plastered her golden mane to her back and 
flushed her pale skin to a delicate pink. Although it was late spring 
here in bustling Paris, the air still had a faint chill until early 
afternoon, and the nineteen-year-old Corsican enjoyed her warmth when 
given the choice. Long, hot showers, like shopping, were one of the few 
guilty pleasures she allowed herself. They also gave her time to relax, 
unwind and think.

Tilting her face up toward the showerhead, Mirelle closed her eyes, 
letting the water stream down her lean, athletic body. There was 
certainly no shortage of things to think about. It had been a month and 
a half since she and her partner, Kirika Yuumura, had limped away from 
the rain of blood and gristly death that had marked the end of Le Grand 
Retour, their final trial as candidates worthy to bear the name Noir. 
The end of a pilgrimage to the past they had begun nearly a year before, 
an ending to a dark, violent chapter in both their lives. In the short 
space of time since then, there had been no end to the dozens of things 
that had to be taken care of, set up or mended.

Some of them had been easy, like the first step of seeing to their 
wounds. Eyes still closed, the Corsican assassin fingered the two thin, 
scarred lines where Altena&#39;s glancing bullets had burned their marks 
into the flesh of her left shoulder. Although her more serious injuries 
&#150; the knife wounds she&#39;d received from Chloe &#150; had already been 
well-bandaged by Kirika, the bullet burns had still needed to be dressed 
once they returned to the Jeep. Of course, her more pressing concern had 
been Kirika&#39;s gunshot wound. For a few heart-stopping moments, Mirelle 
had actually feared the bullet might have damaged her intestines or 
other internal organs, but thankfully, it had missed most of the major 
trouble areas. Still, blood loss and infection had been an extreme 
worry.

Mirelle shivered slightly in spite of the water&#39;s heat, remembering the 
feel of Kirika&#39;s lifeblood oozing past her fingertips as she applied 
pressure and dressed the injury. Luckily, her assassin&#39;s instincts had 
convinced her to stock their transport with as many first-aid supplies 
as she could gather. After some quick, careful cleanup and a change of 
fresh clothes, she&#39;d settled her partner in the passenger seat with 
several soft blankets and begun the long drive back home to 
civilization.

They&#39;d arrived in Paris after three a.m. the next night, exhausted and 
aching, but relieved to see familiar sights again. The first stop had 
been to a small, well-equipped clinic run by one of her &#39;doctor&#39; 
contacts, a discreet man in his late twenties named Patrick who hadn&#39;t 
so much as blinked when they showed up. He&#39;d patched the two of them 
back together with calm professionalism &#150; Kirika first, under Mirelle&#39;s 
watchful gaze &#150; then packed up a bag of supplies and made sure they 
would be safe getting home. The apartment had come soon after. Mirelle 
smiled faintly, reaching for the shampoo as she remembered the surprise 
on Kirika&#39;s worn face as she limped slowly inside the door. &quot;You &#150; 
cleaned up.&quot; She&#39;d spoken quietly, reddish-brown eyes scanning the 
apartment. Mirelle hadn&#39;t been able to suppress a smile, tired and 
drained as she was. The day between her first meeting with Remy Breffort 
and her decision to go to the Manor had been a long, lonely one, mind 
and emotions shattered nearly beyond repair. Cleaning the chaos left by 
the Knights of Paris had been thoughtless busy work, something to keep 
her hands busy while her head was elsewhere. The fix had been far from 
perfect &#150; the long terrace windows had still been shot out, the walls 
and pool table riddled with bullet holes, and both their orchid and the 
customized computer had met tragic ends. Still, it had been home, and as 
the sun showed a golden hint over the horizon, it had been enough for 
them.

Mirelle&#39;s small smile turned to a wry smirk as she leaned back under the 
spray, rinsing suds from her thick mane. Those first few days had been 
rougher than even she expected. Kirika had developed a slight fever, and 
Mirelle had spent most of her hours watching over her partner, placing 
cool cloths over her forehead, changing her bandages and feeding her the 
antibiotics Patrick had prescribed. Any free time had been spent 
ordering replacements for their destroyed things and reestablishing her 
underworld connections, getting in touch with her contacts to find out 
just what was going on. She&#39;d been surprised to find out that Soldats 
seemed content to leave them alone, at least for the time being. 
Breffort had actually put out the word &#150; which Paula had carefully and 
faithfully reported over the secured phone &#150; that he himself would 
welcome any friendly contact, but as long as Noir left Soldats alone, 
the High Council was prepared to do the same. Mirelle hadn&#39;t wanted to 
believe him, but she hadn&#39;t had much of a choice at the time. And it 
appeared that he was as good as a word, if the last few weeks were 
anything to judge by.

Still, that had been one of their easiest problems, and the two partners 
hadn&#39;t spent their time idly. After a few days of long, thoughtful 
conversation, both of them had come to the decision to stay as assassins 
for hire, albeit with a few more restrictions on their client lists. It 
wasn&#39;t a first choice, or even a second, but Mirelle and Kirika had 
admitted to each other that there were few other options in the matter. 
They had spent their entire lives as lethal killers, the very best in 
their field, with deadly instincts trained deep into mind and body 
alike. Going to a normal school, even taking a normal job was out of the 
question. At best, it would be a ticking clock, at worst, a powder keg. 
How long before one of them made a mistake in the heat of the moment and 
killed an innocent, or one of their enemies discovered their &#39;regular&#39; 
lives and came after them? Shaking the water from her face, Mirelle 
laughed wryly to herself. They just weren&#39;t equipped to deal with normal 
life in the light, as strange as that sounded. So they would stay as 
Noir, angels of death in the shadows, dealing with their bloody, 
sometimes-monstrous heritage together.

Together. Sighing, the lean young woman reached for the soap. There was 
still a faint, lingering strangeness to the idea that she was still part 
of pair, that she still had her other half to guard her back and for her 
to protect. There was no real question that she cared for Kirika; she 
had known it even before she&#39;d stood in the graveyard, the sky weeping 
with heaven&#39;s own tears, and found herself unable to pull the trigger. 
She&#39;d simply never acknowledged the feeling to herself. Not until she&#39;d 
faced that fiery abyss, her dark-haired partner hanging from her shaking 
arm, and the thought of living without Kirika had been too desolate to 
bear.

In her own turn, Kirika had shyly admitted during their talks that she 
couldn&#39;t imagine living away from Mirelle, either. Scrubbing at her arms 
with a washcloth, the blonde assassin snorted with amusement. They were 
certainly an odd, unlikely pair &#150; the small, dark-haired Japanese girl, 
reserved and quiet, and the tall, golden-maned Corsican with her sharp 
tongue, incredible confidence and love of fashion &#150; but in her heart, 
Mirelle knew they complimented and completed each other in ways no other 
could match.

Not that they were lovers, or any nonsense like that. The emotions of 
Kirika&#39;s final letter, the scene in the graveyard, Mirelle&#39;s own race to 
the Manor and refusing to let her partner fall, all the sacrifices and 
pain &#150; none of it had come up in any of their talks. Pushing back wet 
bangs where they stuck to her cleaned face, Mirelle&#39;s eyes darkened 
slightly. They hadn&#39;t talked about it because there was nothing to talk 
about. Those were just the things one did for their partner, for their 
other half.

And if you try hard enough, commented a snide voice in her subconscious, 
you can almost hear the river in Egypt.

Of course, they had made some changes. Mirelle&#39;s full lips curled up in 
a pleased grin as she poured some lilac-scented conditioner into her 
palms. With Kirika cooped up in bed until her wound healed, the blonde 
Corsican had taken to educating her partner in non-death subjects with 
the same relish she showed with her own hobbies. So far, the petite 
Asian had made her way through several of the classics, as well as a few 
other, more modern titles Mirelle had searched out. She was also 
learning about fashion, with somewhat mixed results, and cooking, which 
was turning out quite well. Though even better, at least in Mirelle&#39;s 
eyes, was her renewed interest in drawing and painting. She&#39;d filled up 
several sketchbooks already, mostly with studies and various still-life 
scenes in pencil, all of them presented in shy pride to her partner for 
comment and approval. Actually, Mirelle thought that part was rather 
sweet, though she&#39;d never admit it. She made a point of looking at each 
piece individually, these little pencil sketches that showed off the 
world as Kirika saw it.

The sarcastic little voice popped up in her head again, smirking. You&#39;d 
love seeing them even if they were the ugliest doodles in the world, as 
long as they belonged to your little Kirika.

Mirelle pointedly ignored that thought, tilting her head back so the 
water could pour down her chest and over her shoulders. A contented sigh 
escaped her. Their lives might not be usual in any sense of the word, 
but it was finally their own, without any puppet masters hidden in the 
shadows to manipulate their every move. The world was finally normal 
again, as normal as it would ever be for the two of them, and for that, 
she was grateful. Bending, she twisted the faucet knob, turning off the 
shower. We really made it.

&quot;Mireyu?&quot;

She smiled. As long as we have each other, we can survive.</pre>
