Morning Sunlight


Mireille slowly opened her bleary eyes and yawned quietly, before 
wincing at the uncomfortable throbbing ache that suffused the left side 
of her face with the latter action. But the painful reminder of her 
scarred and tender cheek did not ebb her positive mood in the least. It 
was a new morning of a new day, a day when everything would be turned 
around for her and Kirika, her partner... her love. This morning would 
not be like the others before it, tarnished by an ever-thickening wall 
enforcing a remote distance between their hearts. The sun had risen on a 
fresh dawn, and with it, the desolate wall had fallen, the mortar 
holding its bricks together crumbling, struck a mortal blow by the 
rejuvenating light shining upon it. It was a second chance for Mireille, 
a second chance to do things right. The pristine daylight not only 
demolished the deep wedge separating her and Kirika, but also 
illuminated a new route on the black path to the blonde, one crafted 
specifically for two. While the pitiless threats against the duo still 
existed to meet them head-on along their dark route, the sure knowledge 
did not discourage Mireille&#39;s spirits. For neither she nor Kirika were 
alone to face them--they had each other. They were a partnership, and as 
such, would confront the perils lined against them as one. Together. As 
they should have done from the very beginning.

Mireille turned her head to where Kirika was slumbering next to her in 
their bed. The girl was on her side, clinging to Mireille closely, as 
per usual. However, her embrace was a little stronger than typical, the 
toned muscles of her arm around the blonde&#39;s waist distinctly taut. Yet 
Mireille took no real enjoyment from her partner&#39;s tight hug as she 
normally would have--it was but another testament of her neglect, her 
failure. Kirika&#39;s habit of cuddling into Mireille during her sleep was 
no longer deemed as solely an endearing quirk by the Corsican, but now 
additionally as an act of need on the diminutive girl&#39;s part, be it an 
unconscious one or otherwise. That Kirika was holding her near with 
increased enthusiasm was damning proof of Mireille&#39;s maltreatment 
towards her... and how much she required the woman&#39;s care.

Kirika&#39;s eyes crept open at Mireille&#39;s movement, the girl&#39;s senses acute 
as ever, picking up the tiniest amount of motion from her bedfellow. Her 
docile reddish-brown eyes met the blonde&#39;s own blue ones with an avid 
interest. The two young women then simply regarded one another for a few 
moments, a comfortable silence arising between them--a far cry from the 
other silence that had stifled conversation and temperaments in recent 
days.

A small, gentle smile broke out on Mireille&#39;s features, her icy azure 
eyes taking on a compassionate shade; that of clear summer morning&#39;s 
sky. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; she asked Kirika quietly in a sympathetic 
tone.

&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Kirika replied just as softly. To Mireille&#39;s slight surprise 
but considerable delight the girl then smiled. It was faint smile, but a 
sweet one nonetheless, the gesture doing wonders to make her pretty face 
all the more beautiful. It had been a long time since Mireille had seen 
such a lovely and heart-warming sight adorn her partner&#39;s cute visage, 
and the blonde felt her own smile unconsciously grow in tandem.

Kirika&#39;s expression then became anxious all of a sudden, her smile 
gone--and its appearance entirely too brief in Mireille&#39;s 
opinion--before she scooted even closer to the blonde if that were 
possible, her lithe body squeezing snugly up against the woman&#39;s side, 
with her face scant inches from the Corsican&#39;s own. The darkhaired 
girl&#39;s expressive eyes went to Mireille&#39;s scratched and partially 
obscured left cheek resting on the pillow for a couple of seconds, 
before returning to her partner&#39;s gaze. Her lips parted slightly but 
then closed again, as though she wished to say something but couldn&#39;t 
quite find the words. Nevertheless, Mireille didn&#39;t need Kirika&#39;s words 
to know what was dancing earnestly on the tip of her tongue and laying 
heavy on her mind.

&quot;I told you before; I&#39;m fine,&quot; Mireille patiently placated her visibly 
concerned partner, placing one hand--with only an instant&#39;s 
hesitation--reassuringly on Kirika&#39;s lean forearm arranged atop her 
stomach. &quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika mumbled, nodding, but not sounding nor looking very 
convinced.

Mireille held back a longsuffering sigh. For as long as she could recall 
Kirika had always been remarkably protective of her, insistently 
following her around wherever she went regardless of the time of day or 
where precisely she was going like a little lost puppy... or perhaps 
more accurately, an extremely loyal guard dog. Once, the girl had 
practically slain the entire ranks of a Taiwanese criminal syndicate in 
open combat simply to liberate Mireille from their clutches sheer 
minutes after the woman&#39;s capture--the level of her devotion was immense 
to say the least. The only cases when Mireille had successfully managed 
to persuade Kirika to part from her side and remain behind was when she 
had been able to provide the faithful girl with a compelling argument 
that declared it would be in the Corsican&#39;s benefit if she complied. 
However, if Mireille were proceeding into danger, then any rationale or 
even outright demand for her younger partner to stay behind would fall 
on deaf ears. Mireille&#39;s seeming influence over Kirika counted for 
naught when her personal security was involved--a truth that had 
exasperated the blonde assassin on a number of occasions.

And now with Mireille being injured, despite that injury consisting of 
merely a few superficial cuts, she could expect her partner to be even 
doubly more protective of her. She doubted whether Kirika would so much 
as let her leave her sight when outside of the apartment before the 
wounds healed. The sooner Mireille masked the lacerations on her cheek 
with make-up the better; she didn&#39;t want the girl constantly fussing 
over her--it would get tiresome quickly... and she didn&#39;t like it when 
Kirika worried. Still... it certainly was nice to have someone fret 
about her.

&quot;What about you?&quot; Mireille countered, her reflective thoughts reminding 
her of another, momentous, instance when Kirika had exhibited her 
profound loyalty--her profound love--for her. &quot;Your wound...&quot; she 
elaborated quietly, in part to take the softhearted girl&#39;s mind off of 
her injury, and in another out of genuine concern. Mireille hadn&#39;t 
inquired about Kirika&#39;s health in quite a long while, her daily physical 
checks forgone in the face of the recurrence of Soldats in their lives, 
presuming that since she wasn&#39;t complaining--as if Kirika would 
complain! Another fool excuse!--or clearly hurting, that she had 
recovered fully from her old gunshot wound. It was yet further 
mistreatment by Mireille.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika said in the negative, shaking her head where it lay on the 
pillow next to Mireille&#39;s, &quot;it&#39;s okay, now.&quot;

&quot;Let me see it anyway,&quot; Mireille kindly persisted, smiling 
encouragingly.

Kirika emitted a second peep, this one of happy obedience, and then 
pushed down the bedcovers from her body and raised the hem of her vest, 
revealing the left side of her skinny abdomen to her older partner&#39;s 
attentive eyes.

Mireille saw that Kirika&#39;s wound appeared roughly the same as she 
remembered the last time she had studied it, merely a faded scar less 
than an inch long, barely noticeable unless the observer knew where to 
look. She examined it carefully for several moments--pointedly ignoring 
the unpleasant clenching around her heart at the sight of the souvenir 
Kirika had picked up by skirting so close to death for her sake--while 
speculating how to broach another subject she needed to quiz the 
reticent girl on, one connected to the permanent scar blemishing her 
partner&#39;s body; a trademark of their profession and the risks that came 
with it.

Eventually, following a short period of silence and a subsequent 
resigned sigh from the woman, Mireille voiced her unease, but 
consciously kept any sign of it from her tone. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re up 
to... this?&quot; she said softly but seriously, gazing levelly into Kirika&#39;s 
eyes. Mireille still wasn&#39;t totally certain what the stimulus behind 
Kirika bursting into tears the previous night had been, but like the 
reasons for her partner freezing up in the subway station before it, she 
was fairly confident it was related to killing those men in the Metro. 
Looking back, her insensitive remark praising the girl&#39;s grisly 
performance probably hadn&#39;t helped matters either; instead of bolstering 
Kirika&#39;s spirits, it had in all likelihood amplified her sorrow.

As a result of Kirika&#39;s disconcerting behaviour last night and of her 
past misgivings that now plainly could not be offhandedly dismissed as 
something she would &#39;get over&#39; in time as Mireille had foolishly duped 
herself into believing, the Corsican assassin had to be absolutely 
positive her partner was up to handling the adversities ahead. If Kirika 
were to crack again at a crucial instant, for example during one similar 
to the prior situation in the Metro, then there was a high probability 
that she would be killed. It had been pure luck the girl had snapped out 
of her stupor in time to prevent a tragedy, but the outcome of the next 
incident might be utterly--and terribly--different. Mireille would *not* 
lead Kirika to an early grave; if her feelings towards murder were 
unstable, then the woman had to know immediately... even if her concern 
was somewhat belated, she regretfully admitted. Mireille was not willing 
to gamble with Kirika&#39;s life; she would face the false Noir and whatever 
cronies they enlisted to assist them solo if she had to, her partner&#39;s 
reservations to her launching herself into danger unaccompanied be 
damned.

To Mireille&#39;s mild surprise, Kirika nodded her head firmly, and for a 
second the woman thought she had glimpsed something smoulder deep in the 
brown depths of her eyes, with a glimmer of something hard in the core 
beneath, like cold steel glinting in sunlight. But it was gone before 
she knew it, Kirika&#39;s meek look restored as if it had never left in the 
first place. Curiously, for some reason that simple gesture was enough 
to convince Mireille of her partner&#39;s readiness however, eliciting a 
smile from the blonde, albeit one tinged with a hint of sadness at the 
introverted girl&#39;s choice.

&quot;Alright,&quot; she acquiesced just as straightforwardly and in the same soft 
voice she had adopted beforehand, holding her steady gaze with Kirika 
for a couple of extra moments.

Mireille then broke the stare and rolled away from Kirika onto her right 
side, before she sat up and climbed out of bed, leaving the girl&#39;s 
heartfelt embrace. There were many vital tasks for her--for *them*--to 
do today. Mireille and Kirika at long last had a sufficient lead on 
Ryosuke and Vincent, or at least one worth investigating. The Corsican 
was aware of who Millet--Richard Millet--was; it would be rather remiss 
of her to not be informed on the generally noteworthy people in the 
underworld of her own home city. But Millet was a reasonably small-time 
gang boss dabbling in prostitution and some paltry drug dealing, not a 
big name at all in Paris&#39; criminal circles. Why the fake Noir had 
procured his and his trivial syndicate&#39;s aid was puzzling. Was it for 
relative anonymity? Or was it perhaps to obtain fodder to dispatch 
against a powerful rival-- &#39;Noir&#39;--for an unknown purpose? And more 
importantly, not to mention also a little disturbingly, how had the 
group anticipated that Mireille and Kirika would be walking down that 
specific street last night out of all the other streets in Paris? To say 
the odds were slim was an understatement.

Whatever the basis for Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s seemingly ill-advised 
hiring decision, along with the means Millet&#39;s men had used to track 
Mireille and Kirika down, the drafted crime boss and his apparent base 
of operations, &#39;Slick Chicks&#39;, would have to be looked into. Of course, 
there was always the prospect that the gangster Mireille had 
interrogated had lied through his teeth--the woman had known of some 
individuals who could blather elaborate and compelling falsehoods 
realistically even when staring the Reaper squarely in the face. But she 
and Kirika had no choice in how to proceed in spite of this possibility; 
the goon&#39;s testimony was all they had to go on.

However, finding answers to her questions together with researching the 
new enemy could wait. Mireille turned her head to look over her 
shoulder, back to where Kirika lay on her side, unmoved from her 
position in the bed. &quot;You know, I haven&#39;t eaten a decent breakfast since 
the last one you prepared for me,&quot; she said playfully, while favouring 
the expressionless girl with a wide, impish smile. &quot;What do you say 
about having a full course one this morning?&quot; Mireille turned around 
fully, tilting her head teasingly to one side. &quot;You can help me, too, if 
you wish...&quot;she added enticingly, knowing that Kirika wouldn&#39;t be happy 
otherwise.

For the time being, all tasks associated with Ryosuke and Vincent and 
their &#39;friends&#39; didn&#39;t matter; Kirika&#39;s needs and desires were 
paramount. Mireille had neglected her appallingly in the name of the new 
threat opposing them, but no longer would the girl play second fiddle to 
*anything*--nothing was more important than her, the young woman 
Mireille loved. Nevertheless, the blonde had a considerable amount of 
making up to do, and what better time to start than this perfect, fresh 
and sunny morning.

******

&quot;Hm. You have your instructions. Keep me informed.&quot; Breffort pressed the 
button to end the secure call on his mobile phone, and then resumed 
gazing out his office window overlooking the city. The location of his 
Paris-based office provided a panoramic vision of the magnificent 
capitol of France, which looked especially magnificent at present, its 
streets and buildings both antiquated and modern enveloped in the soft 
early morning sunlight. But as he had anticipated, this dawn&#39;s 
illumination had revealed much more than just a historic metropolis.

Breffort replaced his mobile phone in the inside pocket of his charcoal 
suit jacket, and then allowed himself a quiet sigh--one of mild, yet 
sincere, relief. It had been a fortunate occurrence when Ishinomori and 
Hsu had walked into the workplace of local felon Richard Millet and 
appointed his organisation&#39;s services... although if truth were told the 
Soldats official had no clue why the two consummate assassins had even 
bothered to procure outsider assistance from such a small and quite 
insignificant syndicate. But the &#39;why&#39; didn&#39;t honestly matter... even if 
it did cast further intrigue upon the two men&#39;s still unexplained 
motivation for being here in Paris.

Ishinomori and Hsu&#39;s decision to utilise hired guns had imparted a 
valuable opportunity for Breffort to test whether Bouquet and her 
partner were still worthy of being labelled with the title of Noir. To 
that end, the Soldats member had gifted one of his operatives--who had 
wormed his way deep into Millet&#39;s midst and had been remaining 
undercover there for some time, like countless other such agents who 
Breffort had inserted into every even vaguely prominent organised group 
in the city, both big and small alike--with choice information, among 
which included the precise whereabouts of Bouquet and her partner during 
their excursion last night. As instructed, Breffort&#39;s agent had passed 
on that knowledge to Millet&#39;s would-be hitmen, but if the five corpses 
of known mobsters that had cropped up in the light of this morning&#39;s 
sunrise were any indication, it had done them very little good. Not that 
Breffort minded--the slaying of Millet&#39;s men symbolised that Noir yet 
had some talent, which had been the genuine and sole purpose for the 
ill-fated group of gangsters, a purpose they had unknowingly sacrificed 
their lives to fulfil.

However, disposing of five assailants simultaneously was a simple task 
for an above average assassin, and more so for a pair of them. Noir&#39;s 
ordeal the previous night had merely been the opening challenge of their 
examination, and one that Breffort had been almost totally certain they 
would survive. No, the real test would come later. With the deaths of 
the men, Bouquet and her partner now had the scent of a larger pack of 
foes--Millet and his organisation. There was still his entire group left 
for the duo to contend with... which they would do so willingly. 
Breffort knew Mireille Bouquet; she was not the type to simply take 
things lying down. She would do her utmost to discover who had been 
responsible for the attack last night, and then unleash terrible 
vengeance upon them. Yes, she could be such a vengeful young woman... a 
trait Breffort could and would use to his advantage. Bouquet would 
definitely take her partner and retaliate against Millet--it was only a 
matter of when. Completely destroying a criminal syndicate 
single-handedly would be the true test of Noir&#39;s skills and whether they 
had dulled or not. But Breffort was confident they would pass the trial 
with flying colours. He did not fear for their safety. Nor would he miss 
the activities of a minor resident crime group after it had been wiped 
out; it was just one of many in a city--in a world--full of darkness.

While a sizeable conflict would likely be taking place in the city in 
the next couple of days--a conflict orchestrated to be sizeable by 
him--Breffort sincerely doubted that the real battle would be waged here 
in Paris. Even if Noir managed to assassinate Ryosuke Ishinomori and 
Vincent Hsu, the amputation of Kaede Ishinomori&#39;s Black Hands would not 
put an end to the crisis. In spite of their capabilities, Ryosuke 
Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu were still but two individuals, simply a 
tiny--if resilient--scale on a much larger serpent... although more or 
less the same could be said about Noir. In a way, Breffort hoped that 
Bouquet and her partner would fall short of killing the pair here in the 
capitol; it would give him an excuse to send them overseas to the source 
of Soldats&#39;... troubles. And there, Noir could be further used to his 
liking, invisibly collared with him surreptitiously holding their leash. 
In the long run, it would be better if Noir failed. Breffort *needed* 
them.

Nevertheless, he had to be very careful. Breffort had been keeping Noir 
under his surveillance long before he had ever recontacted them, but if 
Bouquet ever learned of his past or present scrutiny, it could pose an 
irritating problem. There would be little she could do if she did learn, 
however, besides being angered and killing his compromised watchers. 
Operatives could be easily replaced, and Breffort was aware that he was 
her only major ally outside of her partner, albeit a &#39;covert&#39; one--she 
would not cut him off so rashly. Still, it would be irksome for Bouquet 
to know for an absolute fact that she and her partner were being 
observed; it could undermine his goals... and that had the potential to 
be catastrophic.

But the risk of Noir becoming wise to Breffort&#39;s attentive eyes was 
slim, and the Soldats member was not about to cease the activity even in 
the regrettable event they did find out--he had staked a great deal on 
those two young women alone; it would be sheer idiocy not to monitor 
their actions. Moreover, while Bouquet was a formidable woman of vast 
aptitude and intellect, he doubted she would be able to ferret out all 
of his spies, even if she did catch one of them. Breffort&#39;s agents were 
everywhere... and closer than Mireille Bouquet in all likelihood 
suspected. Even in the most obscure of places did Soldats see....

The man currently known as Jacques Rousseau snapped shut his mobile 
phone and shoved the petite device back into his dark blue pants pocket, 
before taking several nervous puffs on the lit cigarette between his 
lips. He sighed and looked towards the cloudless morning sky above, 
peering at the blue heavens through his black, square sunglasses, as if 
beseeching them for divine aid. Things were about to get very 
interesting... he just hoped he would live though those particular 
&#39;things&#39;. If he did--which he fervently prayed--he could at least look 
forward to being reassigned elsewhere. While it would be a welcome 
change, Jacques was still somewhat sad about that. He had spent more 
than two years of his life with Millet and his group; it was only 
natural to be a little attached to them. Furthermore, working out of a 
strip club did have its benefits; benefits he enjoyed on a regular 
basis. But Jacques also enjoyed continuing to breathe, and weighed 
against that, loyalty to a gang he had infiltrated counted for squat. 
Besides, his loyalty was already owned by another, superior group.

Suddenly, Jacques heard the rear alleyway entrance of Slick Chicks burst 
open, followed by a frantic shout.

&quot;Rousseau!&quot; Molyneaux yelled as he ran past rusty dumpsters and battered 
trashcans overflowing with damp, putrid garbage towards Jacques turned 
back, his rapid footfalls echoing off the alleyway&#39;s graffiti-defaced 
walls. &quot;Did you hear?! Marceau and the others are dead; I shit you not! 
They were found a couple of hours ago in a subway entrance all full of 
holes! Cops are all over it, but Berlot confirmed it was them! Man, I 
can&#39;t believe this!&quot;

Jacques plucked his cigarette from his mouth and dropped it to the 
ground, grinding it out beneath the sole of his shoe. &quot;I already 
know....&quot; he whispered under his breath, his hand touching the bulge of 
his mobile phone inside his pants&#39; left pocket.

&quot;Hey, are you listening to me?! I said the men you sent are *dead!*&quot; 
Molyneaux continued to howl, finally spurring Jacques into action. For 
the moment at least, the Soldats agent was still a part of Millet&#39;s 
syndicate. And he had a job to do... but not for Millet.

&quot;What are you doing just whining at me for?!&quot; Jacques yelled as he 
whirled around to face Molyneaux&#39;s anxious countenance. &quot;Has Mr. Millet 
been told yet? No? Then go do it, you moron!&quot;

Jacques walked briskly to the back entrance of Slick Chicks barking 
additional orders at Molyneaux&#39;s as the fool scrambled madly ahead of 
him, stumbling in his reckless haste a few times and nearly planting his 
face into the litter-strewn pavement. Noir... they would be coming soon, 
possibly even as early as tonight. He had to prepare for their 
arrival--for what good it would do!--as per Breffort&#39;s orders. Breffort 
had warned him to expect them, and when a Soldats official of his 
ranking warned you, it was best to stand up and take notice. And with 
Noir being the anticipated &#39;guests&#39;, too.... Dear god. The legendary 
pair of assassins were coming *here*. It hadn&#39;t completely sunk in yet; 
it had been more than a week but Jacques was still wrapping his mind 
around the reality that the prestigious Noir was made up of only two 
young women, for god&#39;s sake! But if even a fraction of the rumours about 
the Eternal Darkness were true, then Jacques was beginning to seriously 
question his chances of surviving their advent, even with a whole 
syndicate behind him.

Kirika was standing with her back resting against the black wall 
separating the apartment&#39;s living room from the bedroom, her legs 
crossed at the ankles, simply gazing at Mireille as the woman studied 
her computer screen intently, engaged with investigating the validity of 
the information Millet&#39;s grilled man had bestowed upon them last night. 
Her normally subdued brown eyes virtually sparkled as she watched her 
partner at work, pushing the PC&#39;s mouse around on top of the billiard 
table with her right hand, while holding a cup full of tea that the girl 
had gladly made for her in her left. Soft, golden light from the morning 
sun streamed in through the apartment&#39;s row of windows, bathing Mireille 
where she sat in its warm and pure illumination. The sunlight caused her 
long flaxen tresses to shine even more radiantly, while the flawless 
fair skin exposed by her tight-fitting black crop top and low 
hip-hugging white pants appeared to attain further highs of splendour. 
The raw, angry red cuts had disappeared from her cheek, coated with 
cosmetics Kirika knew, but at present, she thought that perhaps the 
light had cleansed the blonde of all her ills, leaving behind a perfect 
being to grace this world.

Mireille crossed her legs and brought the cup in her hand to her lips, 
taking a brief sip of tea, her eyes remaining affixed to the computer&#39;s 
monitor. But as if the taste reminded her of who had prepared it, she 
then looked away from the screen to where Kirika was standing to her 
left, the woman&#39;s full lips curling into a fond smile directed squarely 
at her partner. It was a small and gentle smile, but one of genuine 
affection, and to the love-starved girl, it meant a lot--she felt her 
own lips form a faint smile in answer. Moreover, it enhanced the 
wondrous vision before Kirika&#39;s eyes tenfold. A gently glowing nimbus of 
sunlight outlined Mireille&#39;s form at her turn, glimmering predominantly 
around her blonde locks, while further light caused her blue eyes to 
glitter brilliantly. Along with her stunning smile, the picture she 
painted was beyond all doubt... beautiful. Never before had Kirika so 
completely understood the meaning of beauty. But this was far removed 
from mere physical beauty; it transcended it onto another plane 
entirely. While Mireille was gorgeous in a simple bodily sense, the 
beauty that shone through to Kirika was also from her very spirit, her 
very heart. The woman was beautiful to her core, marvellous on the 
inside as well as out. Mireille really was a beautiful person, but one 
who possessed beauty in its every shape and form. Maybe Kirika&#39;s prior 
imaginings about a perfect being had a ring of truth to them after all. 
Only an angel could ever hope to even match her partner&#39;s loveliness. An 
angel... yes, the divine scene blessing her eyes reminded the girl of 
pictures of angels she had seen in books. While Mireille may have been 
lacking those other angels&#39; white feathery wings, she was no less akin 
to their celestial flock. Kirika felt privileged merely being in her 
presence, permitted to bask in her heavenly majesty.

Mireille put her cup down on the billiard table and returned her 
attention to the computer, but her fleeting look had imparted a lasting 
impression on her partner. Kirika felt the exhilarating sensation fill 
her chest similar to last night; her unseen wound now an odd source of 
giddy euphoria that she never tired of experiencing. Gazing upon 
Mireille seemed to promote that feeling inside of her, although to 
varying quantities. It was a welcome change to the agony that had seared 
inside her ever-tightening chest, until she thought she would collapse 
from the pain, for days before. She hadn&#39;t felt this... content... this 
happy, since returning from the Manor with Mireille to Paris.

Kirika was aware that part of her content was due to her newfound--or 
rather, newly reintroduced--lone purpose in life. She would be a 
steadfast defender to the breathtaking wingless angel she had fallen in 
love with. Odette Bouquet was dead by Kirika&#39;s hands; there was nothing 
the girl could do for her or any of her departed family but to honour 
her last, dying, wish and dedicate herself for the rest of her days to 
the woman&#39;s only surviving child. Furthermore, she owed it to Mireille 
for taking her parents&#39; and brother&#39;s lives and causing her such 
torment. Perhaps that was why the blonde had lost her wings; her sinful 
craving for vengeance as a direct consequence of Kirika&#39;s misdeed had 
consumed them.

Kirika&#39;s head lowered to the floor, where the sunbeams spilling through 
the windows stopped before reaching her feet, leaving her swallowed in 
shadow. Her smile receded and the elation in her chest drained away, 
until only hollowness remained. Murdering Mireille&#39;s family and causing 
her love such anguish was the girl&#39;s greatest sin, the blackest, the one 
that stood out amongst all the others on her lengthy list of crimes. 
Maybe so devoting herself towards Odette Bouquet&#39;s final request was a 
form of atonement on Kirika&#39;s part, but if that were the case, it was an 
atonement she knew would never come to fruition. Nevertheless, it was an 
atonement she would spend the rest of her life trying to achieve despite 
possessing no illusions of having any chance of success. Repentance 
would always be out of her reach for all of her sins... as it should be. 
Kirika was a sinner, and would remain as such until her death and 
beyond.

However, in spite of her willingness to fight and kill for Mireille&#39;s 
sake, in spite of her understanding that she was a sinner unworthy of 
forgiveness, Kirika still clung to her hope, still clung to her dream 
not seen through. She&#39;d had a taste of that dream following her return 
to Paris before the emergence of the false Noir, but merely the barest 
one, just enough to recognise that its soothing flavour was something 
she yearned for like nothing else. Kirika aspired to one day have that 
tranquil life spent with Mireille again, one where the memories of her 
crimes could dim somewhat, granting her inner peace. A life where her 
worries consisted of what to make Mireille for dinner, and not whether 
the woman would even survive the night. Kirika would keep pursing that 
peaceful tomorrow, that tomorrow just visible and no more on the horizon 
of today.

After all, even a sinner could dream.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

Okay, so this chapter was sort of shorter than usual and not that much 
happen. Oh well. I had to do some plot preparations for the big run of 
action coming up ahead, and also write about Mireille and Kirika&#39;s new 
frames of mind. Remember, it&#39;s not like I conclude a chapter when it 
gets too lengthy, but rather when I&#39;ve written what I have to (and on 
occasion that can become *very* lengthy!). ^_^

I considered having Breffort refer to himself by his first name during 
his part, but I decided against it. It just wouldn&#39;t have felt right. </pre>
