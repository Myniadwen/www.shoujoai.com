Mireille stepped up to the cashier&#39;s counter inside Simon Pierpont&#39;s 
decrepit back alley computer store fa&ccedil;ade, her and Kirika&#39;s first stop 
on a long list for today, and crooked a single blonde eyebrow at the 
jittery and scruffy boy behind it; &#39;Ezza&#39; his name was, if she 
remembered correctly from her last visit. Why was it hackers, whether 
they were merely feeble aspiring ones or genuinely accomplished masters, 
had to have such bizarre--and more often than not, inane--aliases? If it 
even *was* an alias--Mireille wasn&#39;t sure which possibility she found 
more pathetic. It must have been an image thing. Certainly, assassins 
were known to engage in similar habits also, donning titles carefully 
chosen to instil both fear and awe in all those who heard it. It was 
good for business, in mutual respects to garnering clients and 
intimidating targets. Who didn&#39;t quake in terror if they discovered that 
Noir was seeking their heads, after all? Mireille herself was not much 
for titles; she preferred to have people&#39;s faith put in her skills 
rather than how imaginative her adopted pseudonym was, but she had to 
admit utilising one that carried great prestige did tend to come in 
handy sometimes. Of course conversely, it was apt to also attract 
unwarranted trouble that could have otherwise been avoided... as in the 
case of Ryosuke and Vincent, if the men were indeed aware of the 
Corsican and her Japanese counterpart&#39;s old identity.

Ezza, to his credit, did not waste any time on idle chatter, apparently 
understanding by the blonde&#39;s terse gesture that she and Kirika were 
here in the dusty shop to see his friend, Simon--or &#39;Phayzed&#39;, as was 
his asinine alias--and nothing more. Instead he smiled tremulously at 
Mireille and then with an abrupt turn scrambled to open the door behind 
him that led to the building&#39;s basement, fumbling for several moments 
with the rusty brass knob. Mireille was glad Ezza had not tried to spark 
up a conversation with her. This morning she was definitely not in the 
mood for civilities... although in truth she hadn&#39;t really been for the 
last couple of days.

Mireille was a little surprised when Ezza opted to escort her and Kirika 
down the rickety steps into Simon&#39;s computer den, leading the gloomy way 
ahead of the pair while occasionally sparing the blonde a nervous glance 
over his shoulder, but the woman didn&#39;t dwell on it. She was aware that 
she sometimes had that affect on people. It could be somewhat 
irritating--Simon&#39;s obnoxious behaviour came to mind--but being endowed 
with pleasant looks did have its uses from time to time. Guards--most 
notably male guards--typically were susceptible to feminine charms, and 
doubly so if they belonged to a pretty face, a weakness that Mireille 
had taken advantage of all too often. Her attractive exterior had 
loosened tight lips and dulled sharp senses many times before in the 
past, allowing her to perform hits with added ease. Mireille considered 
her beauty simply another tool of her trade, a valuable and effective 
one. Although, the Corsican had to confess, she did take a smidgen of 
pride in her appearance. A woman did have to look her best.

When the trio arrived at the bottom of the stairs, they were greeted by 
the predictable sight of Simon sitting in front of his multitude of 
computer monitors, gazing avidly at the screens at the same time he 
typed madly away at one of his myriad of keyboards. Mireille wondered if 
the boy ever managed to tear himself away from his computers and venture 
out from his basement hideaway into the light of day. Probably not very 
often, if the grimy mattresses and blankets stacked in one corner of the 
dim-lighted room, along with a less-than-pristine looking refrigerator 
positioned in another, were any indications. And Simon did have a rather 
pasty complexion, if one looked past the red pimples dotted liberally on 
his face. By all accounts, it seemed as if the boy lived here in the 
damp and dark basement below the computer store. On more than one 
occasion during her visits Mireille had mused on where his parents were 
and how he had come to occupy and possibly even own a building, even if 
it was more or less part of a slum... and the poorer part at that. 
Perhaps he was merely squatting. In reality it didn&#39;t really matter to 
the woman, however. Her deliberations were simply casual ones--she 
didn&#39;t possess much care or interest for the hacker and his life beyond 
that one generally held for a useful business associate. Simon was a 
resource that Mireille every so often tapped, and that was all. He was 
not her friend.

Mireille saw through the murk of the room that Simon wore a silver set 
of headphones over his ears--their speakers no doubt pumping some sort 
of dance beat at a deafening volume against his eardrums--and, as per 
usual, was dressed untidily in a shabby pair of blue jeans and faded 
t-shirt, the logo printed on the back of the latter garment having 
deteriorated to such a degree that only a washed-out and warped red 
rectangle was recognisable. As a result of the distracting mixture of 
listening to music via headphones and seemingly being entirely 
spellbound by the numerous glowing screens before him, the teen did not 
turn around at her, Kirika and their guide&#39;s appearance. That boy really 
should be more attentive to his surroundings. If Mireille and Kirika had 
been here to execute Simon rather than talk to him instead, he wouldn&#39;t 
have stood a chance... not that he would have even if he had been 
alerted, naturally.

Ezza quickly scurried over to his oblivious friend and prodded him in 
the back with a finger, causing Simon to emit a startled yelp and jerk 
upright in his seat. The self-proclaimed expert hacker pulled off his 
headphones and let them dangle around his neck as he swivelled around in 
his seat, the tinny, distant rhythm of manic music able to be heard 
spilling out from the two uncovered speakers. Simon&#39;s expression was 
that of surprise and some embarrassment, but when he realised just who 
was standing in the basement with him it quickly transformed into one of 
anxiety, and then a fraction of a second later--to Mireille&#39;s 
vexation--to a countenance that contained more than little a glimmer of 
lewd intent. Mireille could already tell that this meeting was going to 
be a tedious lesson in patience and self-control. But the Corsican was 
confident she was up to the challenge. She had to be if she wanted 
Simon&#39;s much needed assistance.

&quot;Mireille! You&#39;re back!&quot; Simon exclaimed in jubilation, grinning 
merrily... if a bit lecherously. &quot;And you&#39;ve brought your cute pal along 
again too!&quot; he added as his eyes settled on Kirika, also favouring the 
girl with his broad smile. He then returned his unwelcome attention to 
Mireille, flicking his eyebrows at her in a suggestive fashion. &quot;Can&#39;t 
get enough of me, huh?&quot;

Mireille ignored Simon&#39;s greeting and grating remark and instead reached 
into her handbag and retrieved a rolled up bundle of Euros from its 
depths, before unceremoniously tossing the cash in the boy&#39;s direction. 
&quot;Your payment for last time,&quot; she said simply as the collection of bills 
bounced off Simon&#39;s chest, causing the boy to hurriedly struggle to 
catch them, juggling the roll in his hands for a number of seconds until 
he succeeded in maintaining a firm grip on them.

&quot;Mmm, Mireille bearing money; is there any better combo in the world?&quot; 
Simon commented as he flipped through the bundle of notes, counting them 
carefully. Abruptly, he stopped and looked up from the cash to Ezza, who 
seemed to be trying to blend into the darkness of the basement and stay 
unnoticed--and not doing a very good job of it, either. &quot;What the hell 
are you still doing down here?&quot; the hacker demanded callously, frowning 
at his &#39;friend&#39;. &quot;Get your ass back upstairs and watch the store! There 
might be shit-all up there, but damn it, what *is* up there is *my* 
shit! I don&#39;t want anybody swiping it!&quot; Simon commanded in a harsh tone, 
thrusting a pointed finger at the flight of stairs leading to the ground 
floor. Mireille surmised that he didn&#39;t like anybody other than himself 
gawking at her. How petty.

Ezza hesitated for a moment, appearing caught somewhere between being 
crestfallen and humiliated, but eventually succumbed to the inevitable 
and after a parting disappointed look at Mireille, headed for the stairs 
and plodded back up them with slumped shoulders and a lowered gaze.

&quot;It&#39;s so hard to find good help, you know?&quot; Simon sighed as he watched a 
dejected Ezza leave. &quot;Ever since Francois left to go to college about a 
month ago I&#39;ve been stuck with that loser. All he does all day is read 
comics! And lately he&#39;s been bugging the hell outta me about *you*, 
Mireille! He&#39;s always wanting to know who that &#39;hot debutante type&#39; was 
who came by the other day. Damn idiot usually kept his mouth shut and 
his nose in a comic most of the time, but now--! To think I wished that 
he would talk more often, geez!&quot; He sighed again and then returned his 
gaze to Mireille and Kirika, most particularly to the latter. &quot;Say, 
where would I find someone like her to help me out?&quot; he asked, motioning 
with a tilt of his head to Kirika. &quot;I think I&#39;d like staring at a pretty 
face all day instead of Ezza&#39;s ugly mug if I had the choice&quot; He gave 
Kirika an expectant half-smile and leaned forward slightly in his seat, 
doubtless waiting for a response, but the darkhaired girl merely looked 
at the lecher&#39;s mottled face blankly. &quot;But I guess she doesn&#39;t talk much 
either,&quot; Simon said dryly, flopping back into his chair again. &quot;Does she 
even speak French?!&quot;

&quot;I have another task for you,&quot; Mireille said grimly, not wanting to 
become bogged down in another one of Simon&#39;s childish little banter 
sessions teeming with uncouth innuendos. And with the mood she was in 
right now, it would most likely be hazardous to his health. &quot;The two men 
I had you search for before; I need to find them again.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Simon whined, his curiosity in Kirika vanishing. &quot;Why? Didn&#39;t I 
do a kickass job?&quot;

&quot;The &#39;why&#39; is not your concern. Just do the deed I have asked of you,&quot; 
Mireille stated coldly.

&quot;Okay, if that&#39;s what you want,&quot; Simon said evenly, abandoning his 
perverted inclinations in the face of the assassin&#39;s frosty temper... or 
at least frostier than usual temper. &quot;But it ain&#39;t gonna be free, you 
know....&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to be. You&#39;ll find an additional one hundred Euros 
in the payment I&#39;ve just imparted to you... and which you incidentally 
failed to mention,&quot; Mireille said, a slight edge manifesting in her 
voice with her last words. Simon merely smiled sheepishly and scratched 
the back of his head, just below where his hair was dyed a discoloured 
green. &quot;And the same bonus as before applies.&quot; Mireille paused for a 
second, delivering a level glare at Simon, who squirmed in his seat and 
sensibly didn&#39;t protest about the payment&#39;s sum... although the assassin 
wouldn&#39;t be shocked if he did at a later date. &quot;I need to find these 
people *immediately*,&quot; the blonde woman continued sternly. &quot;Moreover, 
there is considerable likelihood that the men will be trying to keep a 
low profile. You may find it difficult to track them down a second 
time.&quot;

Simon smirked confidently, relaxing back in his padded leather chair and 
placing his hands behind his head. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about that,&quot; he 
said self-assuredly. &quot;Computer networks aren&#39;t the only form of network 
I can easily get access to....&quot;

Mireille arched a questioning eyebrow, prompting the hacker to 
elaborate. She was positive that he would--she knew he would not pass up 
the opportunity to tout his own capabilities.

&quot;I know a bunch of dudes who, shall we say, stumble upon useful stuff 
now and then,&quot; Simon explained proudly. &quot;I use &#39;em sometimes when 
networking methods fail--although that doesn&#39;t happen a lot, what with 
*my* brilliant skills. But it&#39;s a precaution; I don&#39;t want to let down 
my customers and lose the hard earned rep I&#39;ve gained, you know? It took 
bloody ages to get to the position I&#39;m in today.&quot;

&quot;By whatever means; utilise your informants if you deem them necessary. 
Contact me in the standard manner if you find the people I&#39;m looking 
for,&quot; Mireille ordered, before turning around swiftly to depart, with 
Kirika obediently following suit.

&quot;&#39;If&#39; I find them?&quot; Simon parroted to Mireille&#39;s retreating back. &quot;Oh, 
have a little faith! I&#39;ll find your two playboys in a flash, I bet! 
Once, twice, three times--it doesn&#39;t matter! I can find anybody in this 
city, *anybody!* No one can hide from my--&quot;

Mireille tuned out the rest of Simon&#39;s egotistical self-accolades as she 
climbed the basement stairs back to street level. The gangly perverted 
sociopath wasn&#39;t the only person she and Kirika had to rely on to find 
Ryosuke and Vincent... mercifully. The Corsican had many, many founts of 
information scattered all across Paris, some more reliable than others, 
but all were competent snitches and rumourmongers. They had proven 
worthwhile in the past, like when Mireille had sought answers to the car 
bombing earlier in the week, to name one example. Perhaps they would 
again... or so she hoped. The false Noir would have already fled Le 
Grand Hotel Inter-Continental by now--the blonde didn&#39;t think they would 
be *that* arrogant not to do so. Locating them again would be... trying, 
to say the least.

Of course, there was also the possibility that Mireille and Kirika 
weren&#39;t the only ones doing the hunting. Ryosuke and Vincent could be 
hunting *them* at this very same instant. Even the Corsican and her 
partner&#39;s apartment may no longer be the safe haven it currently was in 
the near future. Soldats--until the final trials at any rate--had 
permitted them the luxury of a sanctuary in the form of the apartment, 
but these new foes would not have such qualms. There would be no sure 
refuge from the conflicts ahead.

That is, if Ryosuke and Vincent truly were after Noir. It would help if 
Mireille knew the rationale behind the pair&#39;s coming to Paris; right now 
she was completely in the dark. Breffort supposedly knew nothing also, 
or if he did, he was not sharing. But Mireille was not foolish enough to 
depend solely on Soldats support, obviously. Maybe her sources would 
learn of Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s motives for entering her and her 
counterpart&#39;s stomping grounds too. It was a very slim prospect, 
however.

Nevertheless, Mireille had to find out, even if she had to deduce the 
reasons herself. It would give her and Kirika an advantage, gifting them 
with insight on their adversaries&#39; potential movements. Besides... she 
couldn&#39;t quell the disquieting feeling that Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s 
mystery motivations would have a further impact on their already damaged 
lives, beyond forcing them back onto the black path... an even more 
harmful one.

But as Mireille looked discreetly over her shoulder at Kirika&#39;s downcast 
face, she wondered if that were truly possible.

******

The dying rays of daylight could be seen through the unshuttered windows 
of the apartment as Kirika walked into the living room a step behind 
Mireille, the lingering sunbeams outlining the tops of the buildings on 
the horizon in a soft amber glow. Kirika had been roaming around the 
city for the better part of the day with her partner, convening with all 
kinds of people the blonde seemingly was familiar with--some of which 
who had made the girl somewhat edgy. They had spent a considerable 
amount of the daylight hours in the shadier areas of Paris; the rundown 
parts where Kirika knew she had to be continually on her guard--or at 
least more so in respects to the other parts of the capitol--lest she 
and Mireille find themselves in a bad situation. The majority of 
Mireille&#39;s contacts had turned out to be not the most upstanding of 
citizens. Kirika sometimes wondered how somebody like her sophisticated 
partner had become acquainted with such corrupt characters.

Despite their resolute efforts to ascertain their adversaries&#39; new place 
of residence, Kirika and Mireille had discovered nothing bar 
unsubstantiated hearsay, none of which that was worth investigating. 
However, the day&#39;s labours had not been a total waste; at the very least 
they had planted seeds in Mireille&#39;s associates, seeds that could grow 
into orchards bearing valuable fruits of information in the future. The 
woman&#39;s contacts were now aware that she and Kirika were looking for two 
Asian hitmen who had recently come to Paris, and henceforth would be on 
the lookout for individuals matching the descriptions they had been 
provided with. Kirika was confident that she and Mireille would find 
Ryosuke and Vincent within the week... although she wasn&#39;t entirely sure 
how she felt about that.

Mireille strode purposefully towards the computer sitting on the 
billiard table immediately after she entered room, as though she had 
blinders on. The enthusiastic sight froze Kirika in her tracks, the 
drowsy girl having been making her way for the bedroom. However, she 
really shouldn&#39;t have expected anything different--Mireille appeared to 
be throwing herself whole-heartedly into their new crisis, after all. 
She probably wanted to check her email for any updates on the search for 
their enemies--she was very committed to her profession. Yes, Kirika 
should not have been surprised... but it didn&#39;t make her partner&#39;s 
action any less dispiriting. They hadn&#39;t even eaten dinner yet, not that 
the introverted girl felt she could stomach any meal. Her appetite 
seemed to have forsaken her lately.

Kirika eyelids sank a little, but it had nothing to do with her fatigue. 
She exhaled softly, and then resumed her walk to the bedroom, before 
climbing up the short series of steps into the room. She quickly shed 
her parka, laying it out gingerly on the sofa nearby the bed, glad to be 
rid of it... along with its hidden and deadly cargo. Another day had 
passed without Kirika having to fire her gun at a living being, for 
which she was exceedingly thankful. For at least this night, barring 
unforseen incidents, she could maintain her pacifism... and maintain her 
dominance over the darkness.

Kirika released another slow and quiet breath, this one of obvious 
relief, as if a great weight had been lifted from her slim shoulders. 
Although, if truth be told, one had been.

Kirika walked back to the bedroom&#39;s steps, parking herself tiredly on 
the centre one with her back to the wall. &quot;Yoisho,&quot; she intoned 
reflexively as she sat, a habit of hers.

Her eyes unconsciously moved to include Mireille in her vision seated in 
front of the computer, the blonde navigating its mouse in her right hand 
on the green felt surface of the billiard table and occasionally 
clicking it, the noise breaking the otherwise silent atmosphere of the 
apartment. Mireille was evidently undisturbed by Kirika&#39;s earlier soft 
emittance, staring at her computer&#39;s monitor intently, a slight frown 
creasing her brow, while her mouth was drawn into a thin line. It was an 
expression Kirika had observed countless times--one of a dedicated 
contract killer digesting new intelligence on a target. Mireille must be 
in her element. Kirika should feel happy for her.

Kirika dropped her gaze to the floor and drew her knees to her chest, 
enfolding her arms around them, hugging herself into a ball. The gap was 
widening between herself and Mireille; it was clear as glass to the 
darkhaired girl. And the worst thing was, Kirika didn&#39;t know what to do 
to stop it.

She had thought that after the events at the Manor things would be 
different between her and Mireille, and certainly, they had been... at 
least for a time. But now it seemed as if those welcome, pleasant 
changes that had occurred were in reality only temporary ones. The 
upheaval regarding Ryosuke and Vincent was only the first obstacle their 
new relationship had encountered, but already the pleasing changes were 
decaying away because of it, regressing everything back to the stage 
they had been in beforehand. Back to a less favourable stage, one of 
apathy and detachment. Kirika had believed her relationship with 
Mireille was stronger than that. Maybe she had been mistaken. Maybe she 
had been mistaken about a lot of things. Maybe....

Or it could be that this was what a romantic relationship was like. But 
while Kirika had no experience in love, she was reasonably certain it 
wasn&#39;t supposed to be this way. She had seen other couples interact with 
each other when she had ventured out of the apartment with Mireille; 
they smiled and laughed together, and touched one other, embraced one 
other. They *talked* to one another. Kirika didn&#39;t do any of those 
things with Mireille, and even in the past, she hadn&#39;t really done so 
either, not to the extent other people did at any rate. Was her 
relationship with her partner somehow different than other people&#39;s? It 
was a possibility; one the girl had deliberated on before.

Almost ever since her love for her partner had been revealed, Kirika had 
tried to educate herself a little on affairs of the heart by studying 
some of the magazines that appeared to deal with the subject Mireille 
frequently read during her spare time, but none of them had provided the 
help the quiet girl sought. For some reason the publications only wrote 
on relationships between women and men, and Kirika hadn&#39;t been sure 
whether or not what was penned applied to her apparently diverse 
situation. She had also wondered why she couldn&#39;t find anything on 
partnerships involving two females. It had been frustrating and 
confusing. It still was. She really should have addressed her questions 
to Mireille; the worldly woman would know of such matters. Perhaps 
things wouldn&#39;t have degenerated between Kirika and her partner if the 
girl had been wiser to how love worked.

Or maybe... or maybe it was *her*. Maybe there was something wrong with 
Kirika herself. Could it be that Mireille was progressively falling out 
of love with her? It was a horrible, gut-wrenching notion, but one 
Kirika couldn&#39;t ignore, no matter how much she wanted to. After all, 
their relationship was relapsing to its former state. Maybe Kirika&#39;s 
lack of knowledge on the topic of love was the cause. She could be doing 
something incorrectly--or not doing something she was meant to be 
doing--that was making Mireille pull away from her. Or, in the absolute 
worst case, the woman simply might not feel the same way about Kirika 
anymore. If that were correct, then there was nothing the introverted 
girl could do to repair the damage in their relationship--there would be 
no point; no point to even go on, really. It was awful to even 
contemplate. Truly, it was Kirika&#39;s most dreaded nightmare.

Kirika swallowed hard and looked up from the floor, returning her sad 
brown eyes to Mireille. There was a sudden strange ache in her chest as 
she gazed upon her partner&#39;s beautiful but cold features. She didn&#39;t 
know what it was, or even its origin, but it... it hurt. It was a pain 
more intense than all of the physical agonies she had suffered during 
her years of life combined. Kirika had to resist the compulsion to 
clutch at her chest, the instinctive action the result of a fervent need 
to somehow assuage the unseen but open wound. She wondered if she had 
been injured at some point earlier in the day without her realising it, 
as impossible as it sounded. Whatever the mysterious ache in her chest 
was, Kirika hoped it would pass soon. With two enemy assassins to 
contend with, she had to stay in peak condition. And also the pain... it 
was verging on unbearable. She didn&#39;t think she could endure it for an 
extended length of time. It was as if her insides were being consumed.

The distance between Kirika and Mireille, from the bedroom steps to the 
billiard table, was only a matter of metres, but to the former girl it 
was the equivalent of a vast, gaping chasm, forcibly separating her from 
her love. She and Mireille were supposed to be partners, they were 
supposed to be in love, but Kirika... Kirika felt... lonely. Maybe that 
was the cause of the ache in her chest. Loneliness. Mireille had always 
been a reasonably aloof person, but Kirika had witnessed the warm heart 
beneath the blonde&#39;s cool exterior--she knew one existed. Now, however, 
it was as though the woman&#39;s icy barriers were up once more, putting 
distance between her heart and Kirika&#39;s, and in turn isolating herself. 
And isolating the younger girl as well.

Kirika was aware she shouldn&#39;t feel lonely; she had her partner, 
Mireille, by her side--it was all she could have asked for, and in the 
past, all she had required to live. But no... Mireille may be by her 
side in a physical sense, but not in the sense Kirika wished her to be. 
Noir... it was a name for two, a fact the girl had taken joy in before. 
While she no longer considered herself or Mireille as Noir, that 
principle--and the happiness that came with it--still held true. Kirika 
and Mireille remained in a partnership of a sort... but it was starting 
to lose the distinctive something that had made it special--unique. And 
with that mounting loss, the feeling of loneliness increased.

Behind and just to the left of Mireille, Kirika caught sight of the 
potted orchid residing on its spot on the small square table by a 
window. The outer edges of several of the large green leaves were a 
rotten, decomposing brown; the result of neglect largely on Mireille&#39;s 
part, but Kirika was also guilty of forgetting to water the plant some 
mornings. The advent of a fake Noir had evidently distracted both of 
them to varying degrees. Oddly, the sight of the mistreated pot plant 
amplified the pain in Kirika&#39;s chest even more.

The sad girl averted her gaze from Mireille and the orchid, returning it 
to the floorboards. She hugged herself a little tighter. Noir.... Even 
if Kirika didn&#39;t think of herself and Mireille as the legendary pair of 
assassins any more, some traits of the ancient and feared title still 
lingered with them--Noir was a name synonymous with strife and anguish.

******

&quot;Noir,&quot; Vin uttered with veneration to the apathetic bartender. He 
leaned forwards towards the grubby man, resting one forearm on the bar, 
and wagged his eyebrows meaningfully--and also expectantly. However, to 
his obvious disappointment, the bartender simply looked at him with a 
bored gaze.

&quot;Look, do you want a drink or not?&quot; the unshaven man said impatiently. 
&quot;I *do* have other customers.&quot;

Vin sighed wearily and straightened, running a hand through his black 
hair. &quot;Come, don&#39;t give brush! Noir, *Noir!* Doesn&#39;t mean anything you? 
I *know* that....&quot;

Ryosuke turned away from the irritating spectacle of his partner 
attempting to persuade the bartender of Slick Chicks, with his limited 
grasp of the French language, into letting them see the manager of the 
establishment, and pulled out a pack of cigarettes from inside his coat, 
capturing one between his lips. Fetching his silver lighter from his 
left pocket, the white-haired man lit up the cigarette and took a long 
drag, flipping the lighter shut with a metallic click as he did so. One 
would think that a poseur like Vin would have made it a point to master 
the &#39;language of love&#39;.

Ryosuke breathed out a stream of smoke from his nose, the resulting 
plumb joining countless others on their ascents towards the ceiling of 
the club. Slick Chicks&#39; interior resembled that of any &#39;gentleman&#39;s&#39; 
nightspot regardless of the city it called home. Men of various social 
standings--ranging from the lower class to the common salary sort--were 
everywhere, hooting and whistling appreciatively while blatantly leering 
at the scanty clad women who paraded around the room shamelessly, 
willingly degrading themselves for measly change. The whores either 
danced wantonly as they shed their tawdry--and sparse--attire on stage 
under the lustful grins and delighted calls of numerous onlookers; 
served drinks to gropers who took pleasure in availing themselves of a 
waitress&#39;s close proximity; or treated some of the more wealthy 
customers to select delicacies in the form of lap dances, before leading 
them through a red-curtained doorway at the back of the main room for no 
doubt further... services.
Had these women no self-respect? Being around such degenerates made 
Ryosuke&#39;s skin crawl. He felt filthy just being in the same room with 
them. Soiled. They were different from Fumiko, and to a lesser degree, 
Claire, back in Yokohama.

Ryosuke put his cigarettes and lighter back in their respective pockets 
in his ebony coat, and pointedly averted his eyes as one waitress 
dressed in red fishnet stockings and a matching bustier--a combination 
that revealed a considerable amount of skin to the casual 
observer--smiled seductively and tried to meet his gaze while she 
cleared a table. Disgusting. Ordinarily he would not even entertain the 
notion of setting foot in a place like this, but Vin had eagerly assured 
him that Slick Chicks was the headquarters of a syndicate that 
controlled most of Paris&#39; red light district&#39;s, Pigalle&#39;s, seedy parts 
and through it the lion&#39;s share of the city&#39;s illegal drug distribution 
network. Such influential people were the kind that could possibly 
provide the support Ryosuke and Vin required to hinder the two new 
Soldats agents stalking them, and consequently permit them to continue 
their search for Dominique&#39;s &#39;crucial&#39; artefact. Kaede&#39;s trial date was 
looming too, and Ryosuke wanted to have at least returned to Yokohama by 
then.

The black-garbed hitmen took another draw on his cigarette and puffed 
out a cloud of bluish-grey smoke from the corner of his mouth. He only 
hoped that Vin wasn&#39;t using their need for outside help as an excuse to 
troll Paris&#39; local strip clubs and brothels. Although the flamboyant 
man&#39;s ability to ferret out information was noteworthy and usually 
produced reliable facts, he had been complaining recently about having 
visited almost all of the city&#39;s old museums and dusty rare antique 
stores, while not being allowed the opportunity to even so much as catch 
a glimpse of Paris&#39; famed Can-Can girls of the Moulin Rouge... among 
numerous other establishments. Moreover, this was the fourth club that 
Vin had shepherded Ryosuke into tonight. And the three before the triad 
member had also claimed were the headquarters of some powerful criminal 
organisation that would be sure to lend them a hand... after he softened 
them up first, of course. All in all, it did not build much confidence 
in Ryosuke that he and his partner would not be fruitlessly drifting 
from one sordid club to another for the remainder of the night.

&quot;Alright!&quot; Vin suddenly exclaimed in Japanese, recalling Ryosuke&#39;s 
attention. The stoic white-haired man turned back to his overly 
emotional companion, meeting his triumphantly smiling expression with 
his own dour one. &quot;He&#39;s going to get someone to take us to the person in 
charge,&quot; Vin informed Ryosuke, gesturing with his thumb behind the bar 
in the direction of where the now absent bartender would have been 
standing. &quot;A &#39;Mr. Millet&#39;, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I&#39;ve heard that he&#39;s a 
big player around these parts--he should be what we&#39;re looking for.&quot; He 
prodded the taller man in the chest a couple of times. &quot;You see? I told 
you this was the place!&quot;

Ryosuke merely grunted and blew smoke over Vin&#39;s head. So they would be 
permitted to see the king of the degenerates, the one who had gathered 
all the other scum under his rule. Somehow Ryosuke managed to contain 
his elation. But sometimes one had to side with demons in order to bring 
down the devil.

&quot;Ryochan,&quot; Vin crooned in a nauseatingly cute voice Ryosuke hated with a 
passion, looking up at his taller comrade, &quot;I&#39;ve told you before you 
shouldn&#39;t smoke. It&#39;s bad for the skin--&quot; He made a sickly expression as 
a fog of cigarette smoke was exhaled into his face, causing him to cough 
and gasp for air. &quot;--And the breath.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve ignored you before,&quot; Ryosuke remarked lifelessly. &quot;Take the 
hint.&quot;

Vin pouted but didn&#39;t say any more on the subject. Good. Ryosuke felt a 
migraine coming on. While the low, base lighting of Slick Chicks was 
comfortable on his eyes, the constant drone of the insipid music the 
strippers on stage undulated to was starting to create a faint throbbing 
sensation in the back of his mind. He didn&#39;t need his partner nagging 
him about pointless matters on top of that.

&quot;Hey, baby...&quot; a slurring voice said from the right, causing both 
Ryosuke and Vin to turn their heads towards the source of the sound. A 
man in a business suit--who was obviously quite intoxicated--was 
grinning rakishly at the triad member, his watery eyes smouldering with 
desire... much to Vin&#39;s distaste. &quot;You are one fine looking woman, ya 
know... what do you say we go into the back, and...?&quot;

&quot;Take a hike, bozo!&quot; Vin yelled scathingly, having no difficulties with 
his French now. &quot;Go on, get!&quot; he added, making ardent shooing motions 
with his hands.

&quot;Awww...&quot; the drunkard moaned, but luckily for his sake, staggered away 
from the area to probably hit on more willing subjects.

&quot;Geez,&quot; Vin exhaled heavily, rubbing a temple, &quot;it&#39;s moments like these 
I think I should cut my hair.&quot; But he then smirked, before sighing 
exaggeratedly, his previously annoyed demeanour altering drastically. 
&quot;Being cursed with such... such... *resplendent* beauty can be so very 
trying at times....&quot; he declared, as though he were a true hero for even 
showing his face in public.

Ryosuke ignored him.

Soon after, another man, this one considerably more sober and dressed 
more stylishly than the last, approached the black clad hitman and his 
posing partner, instructing them to follow him into the back of the 
club. Ryosuke and Vin complied, and were led through a door behind the 
bar and down a long corridor. Cracked grey concrete walls enclosed the 
two assassins and their escort on either side, illuminated by several 
weak light bulbs dangling from above, the occasional one flickering on 
and off. The hard floor was clean however--it had evidently seen a lot 
of traffic.

Ryosuke and Vin&#39;s guide rounded a corner at the end of the hall and 
opened a brown painted door labelled simply with &#39;Manager&#39; in blue 
script a short ways down the right hand wall of the following passage. 
He ushered them through the doorway, before stepping into the room also, 
shutting the door behind him. He then positioned himself against the 
closed door, effectively blocking it and impeding any means of escape if 
things should turn... unpleasant. Fine. Ryosuke wasn&#39;t concerned in the 
slightest.

Seated at a desk surrounded by about a half-dozen standing goons was 
&#39;Mr. Millet&#39;, Ryosuke presumed. He was a greying man who looked to be in 
his late thirties to early forties, with deep wrinkles ravaging his 
leathery face. The crevices made his features appear hard, but Ryosuke 
believed even free of them Millet would still have had a harsh 
countenance. Conversely, his trappings were that of an ordinary 
businessman; a white shirt, black braces and dark red tie. Ryosuke 
assumed that whatever clothing the mahogany desk the man was sitting 
behind was hiding was of a similar style as well.

&quot;So, you two are Noir,&quot; Millet intoned with clear skepticism, looking at 
Ryosuke and Vin as if they were a couple of fools.

That name, Noir. It was one of Dominique&#39;s stipulations for the 
assignment--Ryosuke and his partner were to use the codename, Noir, 
while in France. At the time, back in Yokohama, it hadn&#39;t seemed like a 
major concern to the white-haired man, but he soon learnt once entering 
Paris that Noir was a renowned title in Europe, dating back more than a 
thousand years. It was the name of the greatest assassin ever known. A 
notorious alias brought unwanted attention, but Vin frequently used it 
openly, appearing unaware of the danger he could attract. Like now, for 
instance. Ryosuke felt like a na&iuml;ve child for agreeing to follow 
Dominique&#39;s order without protest. It was liable to get him and his 
companion killed. Maybe.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting two people, nor two Asians at that,&quot; Millet went on, 
one corner of his lips curving upwards slightly into a condescending 
lopsided smile. &quot;Noir, indeed....&quot; He bent forward in his plush leather 
chair, resting his elbows on the desk in front of him. &quot;You may address 
me as Mr. Millet. Do you have names?&quot;

&quot;You know it,&quot; Ryosuke said coldly in French before Vin could react, 
earning an exasperated look from the shorter man. While Vin was a 
proficient negotiator, his broken French was not likely to impress 
people like Millet and his men. Women in this city apparently found it 
rather endearing, for who knew what reason, but it would be an entirely 
different story here and now. Millet would likely laugh at Vin, before 
having him--and Ryosuke--thrown out onto the street. Ryosuke and Vin 
needed to be taken seriously. Fortunately, Ryosuke spoke fluent French, 
a talent he had been taught along with his sister under Dominique&#39;s 
tutelage when they were children. It had been at the request of their 
mother. Back then, years ago when he was merely a gullible child, 
Ryosuke had thought nothing of it bar the prospect of more homework. But 
now he was considerably wiser.

Ryosuke marched forwards and sat himself in one of the chairs arranged 
in front of Millet&#39;s desk uninvited, Vin doing likewise in a second seat 
a moment after him, knowing when to defer to his lead. &quot;There are two 
young women,&quot; Ryosuke began levelly, plucking his cigarette from his 
lips and flicking some ash onto the rich carpeted floor of the office 
uncaringly, &quot;who must die.&quot;

Millet leaned back in his chair, his expression one of bemusement, but 
the Japanese hitman could detect unmistakable anger beneath the fa&ccedil;ade 
at his &#39;guest&#39;s&#39; disrespectful behaviour. Too bad. Ryosuke didn&#39;t have 
time to dally with words. He wanted Dominique&#39;s mission over with so he 
could return home to Kaede&#39;s side. Who knew what lies and corruption 
that despicable gaijin was feeding to his dear sister without his 
watchful presence to deter her? Ryosuke wondered if he would still even 
have a home to return to by the time this insufferable assignment ended.

&quot;Straight and to the point; I like that,&quot; Millet said, but Ryosuke could 
see past his words to the thinly viewed resentment buried underneath. 
&quot;Let me guess, these two broads are your wives you want offed for the 
insurance, or to placate your girlfriends or mistresses, am I right? Or 
perhaps all those reasons are true?&quot;

Vin snorted, and Ryosuke knew he was about to make a clever comment. 
Quickly, so to forestall his partner from creating a potential threat to 
the supremacy he had over the conversation, the white-haired assassin 
continued, disregarding Millet&#39;s patronising inquiries as well.

&quot;Two women. We have no pictures. We have no names. But--&quot;

&quot;Then how the hell do you expect us to find them?!&quot; one gangster scoffed 
incredulously off to the right. &quot;Christ, do you think we&#39;re--&quot;

&quot;The first&#39;s approximately five foot six,&quot; Ryosuke went on unabated, his 
voice raising just a little to counter the hoodlum&#39;s interruption. 
&quot;Caucasian in her early twenties. Blonde hair past shoulder length. Blue 
eyes. Slim build. Attractive.&quot;

&quot;*Very* attractive,&quot; Vin amended impishly.

Still Ryosuke kept up his description. &quot;The second is a young girl; a 
teenager. But still merely a child,&quot; the hitman reported. &quot;Asian. Height 
of five foot or below. Black/brown hair. Brown eyes. Very lean build.&quot;

Millet smiled thinly. &quot;Your descriptions are all very well and good,&quot; he 
said conceitedly, &quot;but what makes you even think we&#39;re nothing more than 
business men? That we&#39;re the kind of people who can be hired to--&quot;

&quot;Both will be armed,&quot; Ryosuke stated firmly, staring into Millet&#39;s eyes 
unwaveringly, talking him down. &quot;They travel together, or near enough 
together. It can be presumed they live here in Paris.&quot; The assassin 
found no reason to warn Millet or his men that the two young women would 
probably be quite formidable. Let them discover that fact for 
themselves.

&quot;Listen!&quot; Millet spat, rising angrily from his seat, his patience 
obviously at its end. &quot;I don&#39;t know who you think you are, but if you 
think you can come into *my* office in *my* club and *demand* me too--&quot;

Ryosuke reached into his coat, causing a multitude of hands to hastily 
reach into their own jackets or behind their waists undoubtedly for 
concealed weapons, but instead of pulling out a firearm as they all most 
likely had anticipated, the hitman took out a thick wad of bills, 
tossing it nonchalantly onto Millet&#39;s desk. The pile lay there, drawing 
all eyes--now clearly wide--to it, their weapons forgotten. The amount 
of Euros in the stack was more than enough for a contract killing of two 
Soldats flunkies, and a sum Ryosuke was positive would make waves. The 
first love of all degenerates was money.

&quot;I don&#39;t care how you do it,&quot; Ryosuke declared in his lifeless voice, 
&quot;or how you find them, or even how long it takes. Just kill them.&quot; He 
bent forwards, stubbing out his cigarette on Millet&#39;s desk. The &#39;big 
player&#39; didn&#39;t even notice, too busy sinking slowly back into his 
leather seat, simply staring, his indignation stymied by the spectacle 
of the considerable pile of Euros just sitting there on the desk before 
him, ripe for the taking. &quot;You&#39;re supposedly the big boys around here,&quot; 
Ryosuke added as he resettled himself in his chair, laying it on thick. 
&quot;Prove it.&quot;

Millet smiled widely and tore his eyes away from the money on his desk, 
his lackeys&#39; own remaining riveted by the sight. Ryosuke wondered if 
they had ever in all their worthless lives seen such an amount in cash 
before.

&quot;I think we can come to an arrangement, my friends,&quot; Millet said sweetly 
in a stomach-turning tone, all smiles now. &quot;But why not kill these women 
yourselves?&quot; he inquired curiously. &quot;You claim to be the most fearsome 
assassin--or *assassins*, rather--in this continent&#39;s history. Couldn&#39;t 
you just--&quot;

&quot;Do you want the job or not?&quot; Ryosuke said.

&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; Millet quickly assured him, grabbing the wad of Euros in his 
greedy hands before his new patron could snatch back the payment.

&quot;Good. You&#39;ll get the same sum once the deed is done,&quot; Ryosuke informed 
Millet. &quot;I trust this is to your liking?&quot;

&quot;Indeed it is!&quot; Millet exclaimed enthusiastically, flipping through the 
stack of money with a thumb before looking up at his men. &quot;Right, lads?&quot;

A resounding series of befuddled but pleased chuckles filled the room, 
none of the thugs likely believing their luck. Ryosuke took it all in 
emotionlessly, scanning his violet eyes over the sleazy faces of 
Millet&#39;s goons. His wary gaze abruptly paused on one individual; a man 
dressed much like his fellows in fashionable attire, for all intents and 
purposes appearing as a member of Millet&#39;s syndicate. Except for one 
minor detail--he wasn&#39;t sharing in their laugh.

Ryosuke&#39;s dark-rimmed eyes narrowed slightly, before they resumed their 
meander. It seemed as if he and Vin had gained new allies this night--a 
welcome turn of events, in Ryosuke&#39;s opinion. But he knew not to relax. 
No, he could never relax. Allies had the tendency to turn into 
adversaries in a blink of an eye... and oft times that eye didn&#39;t even 
notice.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I used &#39;Ryochan&#39; rather than &#39;Ryo-chan&#39; since I didn&#39;t want to get 
bogged down in name suffixes in the future. Think of it as a nickname.

Apologies for waiting until this chapter to have a &#39;Yoisho&#39; moment.

Also apologies for all the stereotypical &#39;hacker&#39; jibes so far. I know 
all computer users who think they&#39;re hot stuff aren&#39;t like that.... 
*cough*

Yoisho = Hmm... think of it as &#39;heave-ho&#39; when it involves shifting 
objects. If it involves sitting down, think of it as the tired sigh one 
makes when doing so.
