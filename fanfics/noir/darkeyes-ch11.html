<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>This job had to be the most boring one he could have pulled.

Robert Anders, member and foot soldier of the great Soldats, leaned back 
against the reinforced wall of the Old Manor and yawned. At his side 
stood three more fellow soldiers, mirroring the other four men standing 
across the hall. All eight were armed with semiautomatics along with the 
usual handguns, ear-coms and walkie-talkies &#150; just like the sentries 
manning the walls and roofs of this place and the neighboring buildings, 
and the men farther inside the winding halls. Whoever had ordered this 
guard detail, they were taking absolutely no chances. There were more 
than sixty soldiers, for cripes&#39; sake! It was seriously annoying. As far 
as he could tell, there wasn&#39;t even anyone coming after the little bitch 
they had stuffed in the main assembly hall. And she was drugged up and 
quiet for the most part.

Still, it was better than some assignments he could name, so he supposed 
he&#39;d best count his blessings. Grabbing for his water bottle, Rob tilted 
his head back and squeezed a long stream of liquid into his mouth, 
wiping his lips with a swipe of his arm. Across from him, one of the 
other soldiers &#150; Kenny, he remembered after a moment &#150; gave him a raised 
eyebrow, looking somewhere between amused and reprimanding. Robert 
ignored the pointed expression. Kenny was a foul-mouthed pain in the ass 
most of the time anyway. Beside Kenny, Juan rolled his eyes and smirked. 
He was a good enough guy as far as Rob knew, usually easy-going, and 
with a decent sense of humor. Robert grumbled under his breath. At least 
there was one of them in this screwed-up place.

Blam! Blam blam blam! Blam blam!

What the hell had that been? Rob&#39;s eyebrow quirked, automatically 
shifting his automatic toward the faint noises from farther outside. He 
knew the sound of gunfire, and yet, the noise he heard was &#150; off, wrong 
somehow. After a few more seconds, it hit him. The shots weren&#39;t coming 
from any of the standard-issue handguns he knew the soldiers carried. 
They were from a different make all together.

His head lifted, eyes wide and body tensing with the prospect of real 
combat. Who was coming? A rival Councilman&#39;s thugs, some gang of 
lowlifes looking to make a name for themselves? Glancing to the side, he 
could tell Kenny and Juan had heard the noises too; they were 
straightened, faces alert and intent as they watched down opposite ends 
of the hallway. There were more shots now, from the other direction. 
Robert&#39;s eyebrows drew together in a frown. Two teams, maybe? Coming 
from opposite sides? His com hadn&#39;t gone off once &#150; why wasn&#39;t anybody 
reporting in if they were under attack?

Another moment, and the gunfire had stopped entirely, leaving an eerie 
silence in its wake. Rob flicked the safety from his automatic, frown 
deepening. He could have sworn he felt eyes watching them, a strange 
gaze pressing down on the very air until it sang with power and tension. 
But there was absolutely no one for a good dozen yards on either side 
down the hallway. Still, as much as he wanted to write the sensation off 
as nerves, it was just too strong. His skin was crawling, the hair all 
over his body standing on end and the taste of copper heavy on his 
tongue. Next to him, the new guy &#150; a kid called Danny &#150; was shaking, 
nearly vibrating with tension. So it wasn&#39;t just his worry, Robert 
thought with a faint satisfaction. There was something very weird going 
on here &#150;

In the quiet, a new sound appeared, different than the shots that had 
erupted moments before. Muted, slamming, as if a stream of bullets were 
deliberately hitting something solid instead of the softer give of flesh 
and bone. It seemed close, but Rob couldn&#39;t see a damned thing. There 
was no-fucking-body there!

Turning slightly to the side, he meant to ask Juan and Kenny if they 
were feeling the same thing he was. Instead, his eyes widened in shock. 
The soldier standing beside Kenny had just gone sliding down the wall, 
half of his head blown away. Blood spattered across Ken&#39;s dark jacket 
and now paper-white face, his gaze black and terrified. Danny was 
jerking around, almost spastic. &quot;Where the fuck &#150; &quot;

Another of those weird noises, and the kid stopped talking, frozen for a 
moment before dropping like a puppet whose strings had been cut. In the 
fading sunlight that still illuminated the corridor, Robert could see 
blood pouring from a new wound in his neck. &quot;Sonofabitch!&quot; Rob cursed, 
hearing Juan swearing vehemently in Spanish. Mostly foul snarling, 
sprinkled with something about ghosts and invisible killers. It didn&#39;t 
make any sense &#150; how the hell had the kid been shot from behind? He was 
leaning against the damned wall!

The wall &#150; no, that was fucking impossible!

Robert spun around, staring wide-eyed at the thick, blank wall as though 
it had personally betrayed them all. There were two holes in the plaster 
and brick now, no larger than the width of a thumbnail. For a few more 
seconds, shock and disbelief held him frozen and speechless. Who the 
hell could shoot though a wall with such pinpoint precision?

&quot;They&#39;re through the damned &#150; &quot;

The words died in his throat as Kenny &#150; having realized the same thing 
and followed his look &#150; spun halfway around and dropped to the ground, 
the third attacking shot having gone straight through his temple. Terror 
competed with a sudden surge of inappropriate, hysterical laughter 
bubbling through Rob&#39;s gut. Somebody had killed Kenny! Wasn&#39;t that an 
American joke somewhere? Robert gave a horrified groan, watching the 
other three soldiers in his squad toppling like bowling pins. He and 
Juan were all that was left, now. Clutching his automatic tighter, Rob 
wondered in the back of his mind if he should simply shoot himself and 
save their unseen assailant the trouble of terrifying him to death.

&quot;M&agrave;s dios.&quot; Juan whispered, staring wide-eyed all around them. His 
jittering gaze focused briefly on Kenny&#39;s ravaged face. &quot;That did not 
come from the wall.&quot; He turned toward his right, Rob&#39;s left. &quot;There is 
something &#150; &quot;

The bark of that invisible gun came again, and Juan&#39;s body jerked as a 
chunk of meat exploded out of his upper shoulder. An expertly placed 
heart shot, Robert realized distantly, watching his former friend &#150; now 
corpse &#150; join the masses littering the floor. But now Rob had caught a 
flash of red and gold, too solid to be the reflection of sunlight. The 
fact that he&#39;d never seen anyone able to shoot from that distance and 
hit shit, let alone the incredible feats of marksmanship in the last few 
seconds, didn&#39;t even register. Instead, his automatic jumped to life, 
spraying the hallway with a howl of terrified bravo. &quot;Come on out, 
bastard! You wanna fucking play, let&#39;s play!&quot;

A sudden clicking sound penetrated his haze, and Robert&#39;s hands 
shuddered as he realized the clip was empty. Dropping the automatic with 
a harsh clatter, he tried to jerk his handgun free of its holster, 
staggering back from the shadowy end of the hall. He never even got that 
far. Agony exploded in his gut, blood running in wet heat down his body 
to join another soaking stain farther down. As though in slow motion, 
Rob felt himself falling backward, dropping onto his ass with an 
ungraceful thump. The stink told him the bullet had hit his intestines &#150; 
even if he didn&#39;t die right away, the infection would very likely kill 
him anyway.

Into the quiet and soft moaning came another noise, one his slowly 
shutting down brain refused to comprehend for a moment. Boots, he 
realized dimly. The sound was the sharp clacking of boot heels against 
the floor. Slowly, the owner of the boots came into view, and Robert 
wondered if his imminent death was making him hallucinate. This was the 
killer, the destroyer, the person who&#39;d massacred his entire squad?

She looked more like an angel that happened to wander down to earth. 
Thick, wavy golden tresses forming a halo around her elegant features, 
pale, flawless skin, and a lean, beautiful body showed off to gorgeous 
perfection in a black leather skirt and a tight, sleeveless shirt of 
crimson velvet. Each smooth, liquid stride was like pure grace made 
flesh, the knee-high black leather boots rapping out his death with 
perfect precision. She had a matching leather jacket thrown almost 
carelessly over one shoulder, and Rob could see a black shoulder rig 
strapped across her torso. It fit with the handgun she held in her right 
hand. Robert didn&#39;t know much beyond the basics of guns &#150; he was fairly 
sure it was a Walther, and not a PPK, but the actual model eluded him. 
Though judging from the confident ease she carried it with, she was 
obviously a pro.

Then, as he strained his eyes, her face leapt from fuzzy beauty into 
full, terrifyingly gorgeous detail. The skin there looked smooth and 
soft, her features aristocratic and amazingly beautiful. But it was the 
eyes that pulled Rob up short, made him realize exactly how this willowy 
young woman could ever have done such a thing. The sapphire blue orbs 
were flat and emotionless, darkness layered beneath a sheen of living, 
glacial ice. There was nothing in that gaze to be reasoned with or 
pleaded with. Looking into those eyes, he knew she really had shot 
through the walls, taken out Juan and Kenny from a distance he&#39;d never 
seen any human being manage. She was death itself, implacable and 
unstoppable.

Glancing down at him, the killer spoke, tone as level and empty as her 
eyes. &quot;Where is she?&quot;

She? The little bitch? Robert coughed, blood running down his chin while 
he wheezed. How the hell had she hit his intestines and his lung? Maybe 
it was two shots, close enough that he couldn&#39;t tell the difference. It 
wouldn&#39;t have been hard for her. &quot;Go to hell.&quot; He rasped.

There was no reaction, but her weapon barked again, and Rob writhed in 
agony when his kneecap splintered. Again came her voice. &quot;Where is she?&quot;

&quot;Kiss my a &#150; &quot; Now Robert screamed, a choking howl as she slammed her 
heel down on the wound, snapping the tendons and grinding bone fragments 
into flesh. &quot;Sh-She&#39;s in the main hall.&quot; He half moaned, half sobbed. 
&quot;In the middle of the house. They&#39;re all there, forty, fifty of &#39;em. 
They left us to watch for intruders. Oh, god &#150; &quot;

The boot moved, and Rob gave a shuddering sigh, the lessening of the 
agony almost a physical relief. A split-second later, the Walther spoke 
once more, and Robert of Soldats slumped back to the floor, a neat hole 
through his forehead.

Mirelle paused only long enough to wipe her heel against the shirt of 
one of the other thugs, apparently considering her options. The eyes of 
the true Noir flicked briefly toward the ear-coms still adorning the 
corpses, but she decided against taking one. Whatever they were planning 
didn&#39;t concern her.

Strategic attack or frenzy, they were all going to die.



&quot;Squad C! Come in, squad C!&quot;

Kirika&#39;s fuzzy thoughts swam back to sharper consciousness as she 
listened to one of the goons yelling furiously. She&#39;d been fading in and 
out since a little while after they&#39;d brought her to this place, 
although she had no idea how much time had actually passed. The thugs 
basically ignored her, talking among themselves unless one of them felt 
the need to shut her up when she groaned or whimpered. Not that she 
meant to do either, but she didn&#39;t even have control enough to stand 
upright. Her shoulders and back were on fire with spasms. They&#39;d hung 
her by her wrists from something up in the rafters, half-leaning against 
the wall, like some sort of hunting trophy or a slab of beef. A choked 
noise that might have been a laugh died in Kirika&#39;s throat. It was 
absolutely ridiculous &#150; she was Noir, a maiden of death. And she 
couldn&#39;t even stand on her own two feet, could hardly open her eyes.

&quot;They took out squad C!&quot; Howled the voice again, dragging Kirika&#39;s 
attention back to him. He sounded so furious, and Kirika wondered what 
he was talking about for a few seconds before the words made sense. 
Someone had taken out their people? Who? Hope flared briefly in her 
chest, hot and bright in spite of her attempt to squash it. Mirelle, oh 
Mirelle, could it really be you? Did you come for me?

Common sense intruded a moment later. Mirelle wasn&#39;t coming to rescue 
her. Even if they&#39;d somehow gotten the blonde Corsican to agree to meet 
with them, there was no way Mirelle would find this place. Or that she 
would ever want me back again. I was so stupid &#150; I should have died 
months ago. Then she wouldn&#39;t have been in danger. Mirelle, Mirelle I 
love you, I&#39;m so sorry.

Kirika swallowed a sob, realizing she was babbling mentally again. The 
thugs appeared to be oblivious to her thoughts, shouting and raging at 
each other. Apparently, there was someone, some group attacking this 
place. Whoever they were, they were heading this way at a worrying 
speed. The goons were split as to whether or not they should stay put or 
leave with her in tow. &quot;We&#39;re supposed to stay and wait for Alexander!&quot; 
One of them protested. Kirika gritted her teeth. That bastard.

&quot;To hell with that!&quot; Another yelled back. &quot;I don&#39;t want to stay here and 
get killed for this worthless bitch!&quot;

Kirika shuddered. She really was worthless. No one needed her, no one 
wanted her. Pain that had nothing to do with her physical agony tore 
through her chest, heavy and pressing. Why couldn&#39;t she just disappear?

A sudden scuffling, shooting noise coming from close by suddenly ripped 
her mind back to the present. Body trembling with tortured effort, 
Kirika lifted her head, opening her aching eyes. At first, the 
flickering shadows and fading sunlight refused to connect with her 
brain; then, with a shock like cold water dashing across her face, the 
world returned for just a moment, incredibly vivid and clear. That lean, 
beautiful shade across the room, darkness in the deeper shadows &#150; her 
chapped lips moved, the anguished, hopeful sound no more than whisper.

&quot;Mireyu &#150; &quot;



Those eyes were the prettiest things she&#39;d ever seen.

Six-year-old Kirika Yuumura stood motionless among the bodies of the 
Bouquet family, solemn gaze locked on the older girl that stood in front 
of her. What had lady Odette called her? Mirelle, that was it. Mireyu, 
Kirika thought silently, splitting the syllables and coloring them with 
the Japanese that had been her first language so long ago. Mirelle 
Bouquet, with wavy golden tresses and the most beautiful sapphire eyes. 
There was warmth in that gaze, a fierce gentleness Kirika had never seen 
before. Something she could almost lose herself in. And the blonde 
wasn&#39;t afraid of her at all.

Her gaze flicking downward briefly, the little Japanese stowed her heavy 
gun in the pocket of her overalls, then looked back up at Mirelle. &quot;You 
&#150; dropped your teddy bear.&quot; She spoke English, though she knew the older 
girl could understand French just as well. English felt right. Gently, 
she scooped up the stuffed animal and held it out, half-expecting 
Mirelle to shrink away or react in fear. It was the way everyone reacted 
to her &#150; fear, awe or brisk efficiency. But this girl did neither. She 
looked surprised, as though she hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d dropped her toy . 
. . but she took the teddy bear without the slightest hesitation, 
tucking it safely back in the crook of her elbow. Her voice was soft. 
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

Kirika nodded slightly, her eyes skittering across the floor to the 
silver pocket watch gleaming open on the tiles. Mirelle&#39;s sapphire orbs 
followed the movement, and now she stepped forward, picking up the round 
metal object in one hand. After a moment, the small blonde held her 
precious item back out solemnly. &quot;This &#150; it&#39;s yours now, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Kirika nodded again, faintly surprised that the other girl would realize 
such a thing. Especially since she hadn&#39;t been raised as Noir. The 
younger child reached out, their hands touching, the watch settled 
between them. It was an oddly intense emotion that swept the two of them 
then; Kirika felt it, and she could see in the depths of those sapphire 
eyes that Mirelle did, too. Intense, almost electric, but not painful. A 
connection, as fierce and real as anything Kirika had ever experienced. 
She had never known anything like it &#150; the closest thing she could 
compare it to was her training as Noir. Like coming home, or being safe, 
needed. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She whispered, closing the lid of the watch and 
tucking it carefully in another pocket.

Mirelle gave a soft expressive look that could almost have been a smile 
. . . there was a sudden motion behind her, movement that instinctively 
meant danger . . . a tall man, with hair like Mirelle&#39;s, jerking the 
older girl back with the same horrified expression they always wore when 
they saw Kirika . . . he was shooting, and a blade was coming at him 
from somewhere behind her . . . and Kirika spun, leaping to get away . . 
.



Bright light flared suddenly in Kirika&#39;s eyes, scraping across the 
inside of her skull and dragging her back toward consciousness. With a 
moan, she batted weakly at the air above her, trying in vain to make the 
blinding blaze go away. It hurt so badly &#150;

Quick, gentle fingers caught her wrist, softly stroking the back of her 
hand as they returned it to her side. A voice was speaking above her, 
faintly familiar but somehow different, not quite right. Another known 
voice answered, this one male &#150; the first cut in again, slightly 
sharper, and Kirika had a sense that it won whatever argument they were 
having. The light went down a few seconds later, much to the young 
woman&#39;s relief. She was so muddled, everything fuzzy and covered in a 
haze. Dimly, she knew she wasn&#39;t tied up or standing anymore; she was 
lying down on something cushioned and soft, the agony in her back and 
shoulders reduced to little more than a dull ache. The air around her 
wasn&#39;t cold, but comfortably warm, even though she couldn&#39;t seem to stop 
shivering. There was no more yelling or screaming either.

And the sweet, smooth hands cradling hers were incredibly comforting.

Gentle clinical fingertips touched her jaw, tilting it softly to the 
side. Kirika couldn&#39;t help the low whimper that escaped her throat, fear 
crawling through her veins like slow sludge. What were they doing to her 
now? She felt better, or at least not as horrible, but was it all a 
trick? The soft grip on her hand tightened a bit, calming touches 
trailing over her skin. The first voice was saying something again &#150; 
Kirika caught her name in the soothing flow of meaningless words. 
Whatever it was saying, the murmur of sound loosened the tight ache in 
her chest, making everything feel light and airy. She was falling again, 
floating away, but strangely, it wasn&#39;t frightening anymore.



Mirelle watched in silence as Patrick finished his examination, fingers 
still absently stroking the back of Kirika&#39;s hand. They&#39;d been here a 
little less than an hour, the blonde Corsican stationed in a chair at 
her partner&#39;s side while the doctor took care of Kirika&#39;s injuries. 
Vaguely, Mirelle was grateful for his quiet competency &#150; he hadn&#39;t done 
much more than blink when she&#39;d appeared at the door, the younger woman 
cradled safely in her arms like a child. Since then, the young man had 
carefully checked her body reactions for the drugs, examined and cleaned 
each and every wound.

&quot;Well, I think that&#39;s the last of it.&quot; Wiping his hands with a damp 
cloth, Patrick tossed it into the sink and sighed, shaking his head. His 
voice was wry, tiredly amused. &quot;Silly me, I hoped you might manage to 
keep out of trouble for more than a month.&quot;

The ghost of a smirk crossed Mirelle&#39;s face, and Patrick was grateful 
for that. He&#39;d been more than a little frightened when he had first laid 
eyes on the two young women. Not necessarily because of the wounds, he&#39;d 
seen those &#150; and worse &#150; before. No, his fear had come when he had 
looked up into Mirelle&#39;s face and seen those terrifying eyes looking 
back at him. Darkness incarnate, power beyond anything human. Those eyes 
had been horrifying &#150; if he hadn&#39;t known for a fact that the blonde 
Corsican wasn&#39;t going to kill him, Patrick was certain he&#39;d have had a 
heart attack right then and there. Folding his arms over his chest, the 
young doctor turned his gaze intently to Mirelle.

&quot;As far as I can tell, her body&#39;s breaking down the compounds of 
whatever drug he injected her with just fine. She&#39;ll be pretty exhausted 
until it wears off, probably a little confused too, but she should be 
alright by tomorrow morning.&quot; Patrick shook his head again, amazed as 
always by their healing abilities. &quot;Maybe a massage for her shoulders 
and back, since they&#39;re kind of tender. There&#39;s no real deep physical 
damage, just a few bruises and some scratches.&quot; He looked at the blonde 
narrowly. &quot;I suppose asking how she ended up with her ass kicked and you 
don&#39;t have more than a few scrapes is an exercise in futility?&quot;

&quot;They got her by surprise.&quot; Mirelle&#39;s voice was nearly as flat as 
before, but there was a low undercurrent of rage that sent every part of 
his skin crawling. Even though it wasn&#39;t directed at him, it was still 
terrifying. Blinking, the doctor tried to gather his wits as the young 
woman stood. &quot;Um, I have a wheelchair you could use &#150; &quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright.&quot; Golden tresses sweeping like a curtain, Mirelle bent 
and gathered Kirika in her arms, cradling the smaller girl close. 
Shifting that dark head to a more comfortable position on her shoulder, 
the Corsican made it all look incredibly easy as she stood. &quot;Put it on 
the tab, will you? We&#39;re going home.&quot;

Still a bit stunned, Patrick nodded, hurrying to open the door to his 
medium-sized office. After a few more instructions, the two young women 
swept out, and he took a deep breath, letting it out in a whoosh as he 
sat down. Briefly, he wondered what had happened to whoever might have 
had the stupidity of touching Kirika. Then he shook himself.

There were some things a man just didn&#39;t want to know.



Outside on the street, Mirelle headed for the new car, Kirika nestled 
safely in her arms. She wasn&#39;t worried about drawing her weapon &#150; she 
knew, somehow, that she could do it without a problem. And she knew she 
probably should have accepted Patrick&#39;s offer of a wheelchair, too. It 
was the most intelligent thing to do, the most logical course of action, 
especially for an assassin.

But it would entail letting go of Kirika, and somehow she just couldn&#39;t 
bring herself to do that unless she absolutely had to. Even if it meant 
her safety, she couldn&#39;t stand the thought of Kirika scrunched up on the 
seat of the car, cold and unconscious and alone. Although, as several 
shadows blocked her path and the darkness in her mind rushed forward 
again, she had to wonder if obeying these odd impulses was going to get 
them both killed.

Lisa paused, keeping perfectly still as Mirelle&#39;s head lifted, those 
frightening eyes focusing in on her. She knew the tall blonde was still 
more Noir than the young woman she had met earlier, and she knew Mirelle 
wouldn&#39;t hesitate to put bullets through anything that stood in her way. 
But right now, she was hoping there was enough of the Corsican left to 
talk with. &quot;Mirelle?&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; The voice that answered was still emotionless, flat 
and measured, but not quite as frightening as before.

&quot;To give you a ride.&quot; Tucking a lock of thick hair behind her ear, the 
young Soldat answered the question honestly. &quot;So you two can get home.&quot; 
So we know you&#39;re safe, she wanted desperately to add, but decided not 
to press her luck. After today, she had a feeling the other girl 
wouldn&#39;t believe that comment if her tongue came notarized.

&quot;I have a car.&quot; Mirelle pointed out calmly.

Lisa nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot; She agreed, her voice quiet and careful. This was 
the moment that might kill her. &quot;But if you&#39;re driving, you can&#39;t hold 
her.&quot;

Mirelle blinked, and Lisa watched the darkness in those eyes receded 
just a bit, warmth flaring in to fill the emptiness as that gaze flicked 
swiftly down to the dark head resting against her shoulder. A slow, 
almost imperceptible movement, but it was exactly what Lisa had 
suspected. Her uncle had said as much, but any doubts the gray-eyed 
blonde might have had vanished in that simple look. Mirelle would rather 
cut her hand off than let go of Kirika, even if it was just for the 
short ride home.

After a long, drawn moment, Mirelle nodded silently. Lisa turned, waving 
aside the two tall, hulking men with her. One of them &#150; Duncan Anderson 
&#150; moved aside with hardly a glance; the other, one of their new men from 
outside Paris, simply stood gaping in astonishment. Mirelle ignored 
both, following the blonde Soldat down the sidewalk toward the limo. 
Behind them, Lisa could hear a hissed, rapid-fire conversation in 
French. Mostly, whether or not she was insane, and what the hell they 
were doing picking up hired killers in the Breffort&#39;s personal vehicle.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Anderson finally growled, effectively ending the 
conversation. &quot;The lady Lisa knows what she&#39;s doing. And the maidens 
deserve our help more than any person alive.&quot;

Lisa&#39;s lips twitched. Their driver opened the door, and she stepped 
easily into the back of the limo, shifting to the side so Mirelle could 
climb in after her. This was going to be an interesting ride.



Kirika floated to the edge of consciousness once more, burrowing 
instinctively closer to the warmth pressed against her. She wasn&#39;t lying 
down anymore, but curled up in what felt oddly like someone&#39;s lap, arms 
bent up against her chest, head resting half against the person&#39;s 
shoulder, half against their neck. Other arms were wrapped gently around 
her, cradling her, a hand stroking soothingly through her hair. A 
familiar voice murmured in her ear, the sound like a low rumble through 
the torso Kirika lay against. She could only make out a few of the soft 
words and phrases, a mix of French and another tongue she couldn&#39;t make 
sense of. &quot; . . . p&egrave; e . . . donne dui . . . a manu neru se securit&agrave;.&quot; 
&quot;scusate tante &ucirc;n la s&ocirc;, &ucirc;n capiscu mica.&quot; &quot;Mon scuru ange.&quot; &quot;Vous &ecirc;tes 
les miens . . . je vous prot&egrave;grai.&quot; &quot;per piac&egrave;, per piac&egrave;, &ecirc;tre bien.&quot;

Then, even softer still, &quot;c&#39;est le nom d&#39;un destin antique. Deux 
demoiselles qui r&eacute;gissent la mort. La paix nouvellement du soutenu, 
leurs mains noires se prot&egrave;gent.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s muddled mind recognized the last part, but strangely, the 
familiar litany filled her with soothing calm instead of fear. The other 
gentle phrases she tucked away for later, letting the light tones wash 
through her. Farther away, she could hear a low rumble, like that of a 
high-performance car. Where on earth was she?

Too tired to figure it out, she gave a soft sigh and snuggled closer, 
exhausted eyes never even opening. Whatever was going on, here in this 
moment she was protected, surrounded by safety and warmth and a feeling 
of utter want. It was enough for now. The rest, she could deal with 
later.



Lisa sighed, glancing at Mirelle as the limo purred along. The blond 
young woman had settled Kirika oh so carefully on her lap right after 
she&#39;d climbed in, her arms wrapped softly around the smaller girl as her 
fingers trailed gently through that short dark hair. She&#39;d been 
whispering for almost the whole time, too, her voice a low, running 
murmur. Distantly, Lisa wondered what she was saying. Soothing words of 
encouragement, maybe? It looked like she wasn&#39;t even aware she was doing 
it.

Looking to the side, she caught the new guy &#150; Pierce, she remembered 
after a moment &#150; staring at the two maidens with an expression equal 
parts shock and curiosity, eyes wide and stunned. Lisa stomped on an 
urge to kick him, then bit down an equally inappropriate urge to laugh. 
She just couldn&#39;t help it. He looked so funny.

Anderson, following the direction of her gaze, leaned over the slight 
distance that separated them on the seat and jammed an elbow in his 
fellow Soldat&#39;s ribs. When Pierce looked up indignantly, the taller 
young man gave a fierce, silent shake of his head. His eyes were intense 
and defiant. Stop staring. He seemed to say, snarling without words. 
Leave them alone. They don&#39;t need your prying.

Pierce had the grace to look embarrassed, turning his head to look out 
the window instead. Good. Lisa leaned back, another soft sigh escaping 
almost unheard. Kirika would be alright; the blond Soldat had done 
enough medical work &#150; mostly field, with animals and people &#150; that she 
knew the younger girl&#39;s wounds were mostly superficial, if a bit jarring 
to look at. Still, the idea that Alex could do such a thing to the 
smaller Japanese was painful. And she still felt guilty. It was at least 
partly her fault.

The auto pulled up to the curb outside of the apartment building, and 
Anderson fairly leapt to open the door. He climbed out, followed by 
Lisa, then Mirelle and her precious burden, then Pierce. &quot;Mirelle &#150; &quot; 
The younger blonde reached, then paused, fingertips hovering just over 
the skin of Mirelle&#39;s arm. Touching was probably still a big fat no at 
this point, if it was ever okay in the first place. &quot;Can you reach your 
keys?&quot;

Again, that faint echo of Mirelle&#39;s usual smirk, a slight incline of her 
head. The Corsican shifted Kirika just a bit, muscles trembling lightly 
as she balanced all her partner&#39;s weight in one arm. Her now-free hand 
dipped swiftly into the pocket of her jacket, returning with a light, 
familiar metallic jingle. &quot;We&#39;re stronger than we look.&quot; She said 
softly.

Lisa nodded, a ghost of a smile flitting across her own lips. &quot;That was 
never a doubt.&quot;

Mirelle nodded once more, equal parts agreement and thanks, Lisa had a 
feeling. Turning, the taller blonde headed easily into the building. All 
three Soldats stood and watched until the door shut behind the maidens. 
Anderson set a hand on Lisa&#39;s shoulder gently. &quot;So &#150; where to now, miss 
Lisa? Home?&quot;

The younger Soldat sighed. &quot;Home.&quot; She agreed. &quot;Uncle will probably want 
to know how things went, and I&#39;d like to see what he found out.&quot;

&quot;And the two of them?&quot; Pierce asked, slightly more subdued after 
Mirelle&#39;s casual display of strength. A laughing smirk flicked through 
Lisa&#39;s mind, quickly hidden. Not so big and bad now, was he? Her gray 
eyes shifted up to the top floor windows, a range of emotions slipping 
through her features. Gentle sweetness, knowing laughter, slight awe and 
even a trace of soft affection. She smiled, turning back toward the 
limo. &quot;They&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;They have each other again.&quot;



Corsican eyes.

That was what she remembered first, living ice glittering savagely in 
the tumbled-down entrance. Those sapphire orbs that Kirika so loved to 
watch, the same fascinating, striking eyes that could shatter her heart 
or send her spirit soaring with a single casual glance. But these 
dazzling, gorgeous eyes were narrowed now, pitiless and cold like chips 
of frozen sky, a distantly lethal expression upon the lovely porcelain 
face in the doorway. Mirelle&#39;s arm swinging up from the deep, endless 
shadows, finger pulling the trigger of her Walther again and again, 
firing with so much more than even her usual deadly proficiency . . . 
reloading once, then twice, pressing her attacks with swift, critical 
combinations of hands and feet, even though the small Asian assassin had 
been sure before this day that her partner lacked more than half her own 
skill in martial arts.

And their enemies died, in scores and piled on top of each other, most 
before they even had a chance to recognize the golden reaper that had 
come upon them. The smell &#150; no, the reek of blood and bodily fluids had 
been almost overpowering, even to a practiced killer like Kirika. Copper 
and cordite lay heavy and bitter on her tongue, burning raw in her 
throat. And the sounds were beyond description. The sharp splinter of 
shattered bone, the hollow pop of torn joints, the repeated crack of 
gunshots and thuds when they found their mark, all punctuating the 
rough, rasping breaths of her captors and &#150; only once or twice &#150; the 
tortured, horrified screams of those unfortunate enough to see death 
coming in the instants before they died.

And once the slaughter was over, and only corpses remained to litter the 
ruined, blood-slick floor, that crimson and gold goddess turned toward 
her, unhurried and unstoppable. Those terrifying eyes focused on her, 
and there was nothing in them, no emotion and no mercy, no escape from 
the overwhelming fear and the eternal loneliness of death they promised 
&#150;

&quot;No, Mireyu!&quot;

Kirika awoke at shocking speed, ripped into full consciousness with a 
painful jolt of adrenaline. Sweat dampened her brow, body shivering 
feverishly, though whether it was the after-effects of the drug or a 
reaction to her nightmare she didn&#39;t know. For a few seconds, her dazed 
mind couldn&#39;t understand where she was, breath coming in harsh, 
frightened gasps. Then her strained eyes focused, and she recognized the 
plain white wall, the polished wooden angles of the dresser she and her 
partner had shared for so long. The soft cotton pulled up around her 
shoulders was their familiar pale sheets, the same ones she&#39;d slept on 
and awakened to countless times in the past, faintly cool night air from 
the windows just barely stirring the linens. She was back in the 
apartment? But how &#150; why?

A shadow swept across her moonlit vision, mattress sinking slightly as 
someone slipped hurriedly under the blankets in response to her hoarse 
cry. &quot;Shhhh, Kirika.&quot; The female voice was low and soothing, an arm 
curling gently over Kirika&#39;s shoulders. Mirelle pulled her partner back 
against her own lean, lithe body, brushing at the younger woman&#39;s dark 
hair with soft fingertips. &quot;It&#39;s alright, I&#39;m here. It&#39;s alright.&quot;

Kirika clung without shame to that comforting arm, still shaking and 
frightened. A terrifying flash of inhuman, pitiless sapphires rose sharp 
and brief, then faded away from her thoughts, tense and trembling 
muscles relaxing by inches into the Corsican&#39;s warm embrace. This was 
her Mirelle, the young woman she cherished, not the bloody killing 
goddess she remembered in such fear. She knew it by the soft strength in 
the arm across her shoulders, the gentle stirring of breath against her 
ear and the tender warmth of the toned, familiar frame pressed to her 
back. The blonde assassin&#39;s chest moved slowly, rhythmically, coaxing 
her partner&#39;s ragged half-gasps into something more normal. Kirika 
managed a long, shaky breath in response, taking the soft, 
faintly-herbal scent that meant Mirelle deep into her lungs. It spread 
into her, floated around her, a warm, invisible cloud of safety. 
Dispelling her fright and pain in a wash of comfort. Tucked here against 
the Corsican, held in this cradling embrace, she was protected and cared 
for. Unbidden, a shaking whisper passed her lips, the questioning sound 
laced with fear, anguish and shame. She had to know. &quot;Alex &#150; &quot;

&quot;Dead.&quot; Mirelle&#39;s murmured answer was fierce but gentle, with none of 
the anger or disgust Kirika had been expecting. The fingers trailing 
through her hair never ceased their light movement. &quot;Him and all 
soldiers.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Kirika breathed, uncertain. Mirelle didn&#39;t sound furious or 
annoyed or even mildly put out. It was unbelievable, especially after 
the argument and the Japanese&#39;s monumental stupidity, but there it was. 
And the soft touches were incredibly soothing. Shifting slightly, the 
younger woman winced, a sharp hiss escaping her throat when her body 
protested. Apparently, her shoulders and back were still more than a 
little sore. She could feel Mirelle&#39;s eyebrows drawing together in a 
frown.

&quot;Does it still hurt?&quot; The blonde&#39;s voice was low and definitely, 
strangely anxious. Kirika hesitated, torn between wanting her partner&#39;s 
comfort for the pain and admitting such a horrible weakness. She was 
already a liability, a worthless fool &#150; her muscles spasmed, throbbing 
now that she had forced them to move. &quot;Yes.&quot; Her whisper was full of 
self-loathing. &quot;Just &#150; just a little.&quot;

Mirelle&#39;s hand dropped from her hair to her shoulder, massaging the sore 
muscles gently. Kirika stiffened, half-gasping, then relaxed backward 
with a sigh of relief. The tense knots clung stubbornly for a few 
seconds, staying clenched, but they unraveled to smoothness again under 
the soft ministrations. Eyes like molten copper fluttered slightly, a 
combination of calmed release and sheer exhaustion. &quot;That feels better, 
I bet.&quot; The blonde sounded satisfied, so much more like herself that 
Kirika&#39;s lips twitched in a faint smile.

The smile faded a second later, Kirika&#39;s eyes prickling suspiciously. 
Her throat was tight, voice shaking and incredibly small, but she had to 
say it. She had to tell her partner how sorry she was, even if the words 
didn&#39;t mean anything. &quot;M-Mir-Mireyu, I &#150; &quot;

Before she could finish, a light finger pressed gently to her trembling 
lips, silencing her. Mirelle spoke quietly, tones immeasurably tender as 
they murmured in her ear. &quot;Shhhh, Kirika. Don&#39;t &#150; don&#39;t say it.&quot; Her 
breath caught slightly. &quot;I know.&quot;

Mirelle &#150; Mirelle knew? How could she? The hand against her mouth cupped 
her cheek briefly before moving back to her hair, continuing the soft 
petting. It seemed impossible that the Corsican could forgive her that 
easily &#150; but why would she have come to the rescue otherwise? Why would 
she have brought Kirika home? Kirika took a deep breath and sighed. 
Sleep returned and pulled at her, trying to suck her beneath its waves, 
but she fought it back. &quot;Mireyu?&quot;

&quot;Ummm?&quot; The blonde answered with a low sound in her throat, noise 
vibrating gently through her chest and Kirika&#39;s own back. It made the 
younger woman relax further, even as her heart clenched. She had no 
right, but the question tumbled from her lips anyway, a halting whisper 
of need. &quot;You won&#39;t &#150; leave me, will you?&quot;

For a moment, there was silence, and Kirika forced her eyes open, biting 
back the rush of sob that choked the back of her throat. She wanted to 
disappear all over again. Of course Mirelle didn&#39;t want to stay with her 
anymore &#150;

Then the blonde&#39;s arm shifted, tucking the sheets a little tighter 
around the two of them before curling around Kirika&#39;s shoulders once 
more. Mirelle held her close, voice low and firm. &quot;I&#39;m not going 
anywhere.&quot; Her steady warmth never faltered. &quot;Go back to sleep, Kirika. 
I&#39;ll be here when you wake up.&quot;

There was so much more she wanted, needed to hear, but for now, those 
simple words were treasure enough. Kirika&#39;s breath ran from her in a 
soft, contented sigh, rust-colored eyes drifting shut once more, and 
Mirelle could feel the brittle tension of her partner&#39;s body draining 
like dirty water. She&#39;s confused &#150; must still be working the drugs out 
of her system. The Corsican assassin lay quietly on her side, head 
propped on one elegant hand, blonde tresses turned liquid silver in the 
moonlight as they flowed over the shared pillows. Her fingers trailed 
gently through Kirika&#39;s bangs, an unconscious, affectionate motion. 
Actually, she couldn&#39;t seem to stop touching the younger woman &#150; 
brushing at her hair, stroking her shoulders or just cuddling her close, 
it didn&#39;t matter as long as she had some contact with her partner. It 
was as though her body was afraid Kirika would melt away if left by 
herself. She didn&#39;t quite understand it, but at the moment, she didn&#39;t 
care, either.

Feather-light, her fingertips lingered on the quarter-sized bruise half 
hidden in Kirika&#39;s hairline, tracing the long scratch down the side of 
her partner&#39;s face until it dropped off her jawbone. In the darkness, 
the wounds were almost invisible, but nothing could soften the dark 
purple finger marks violating the golden skin of her slender, delicate 
neck. Mirelle&#39;s own jaw tightened with barely-leashed fury, hand 
hovering just above the smaller woman&#39;s sleeping face. She had seen 
those wounds fresh and raw, under the full harshness of Patrick&#39;s 
florescent lights. Even without his expert opinion, the blonde was an 
accomplished field surgeon. She understood how bad the injuries were, 
and how bad they could have been.

If they had hurt her permanently &#150; Mirelle refused to finish that 
thought, carefully counting Kirika&#39;s breaths instead the way the doctor 
had suggested. They were all dead, down to the last arrogant suited 
bastard, but it did little to ease the strange ache lodged under her 
chest. That was dull now, with Kirika&#39;s lean body pressed safe and warm 
against her, but still there. Not anger, but maybe &#150; guilt? Shame that 
she had put Kirika in a position to fear her. Jagged splinters of vivid 
memory darted through her head, a kaleidoscope of spinning sensation 
that strung together into a sharp, frightening whole.

It was the smell she noticed first.

Mirelle blinked, slowly, mind rising back to the reality around her like 
she had just woken from a nightmare. A charnel scent, blood and bowels, 
burned gunpowder and singed flesh all mixed together to make a musk more 
at home in a slaughterhouse than this slightly-rundown manor home. Touch 
came to her a moment later, toned and powerful muscles throbbing 
distantly with the faint ache of recent, vigorous use. Flashes of 
several different lifeless corpses flicked through her thoughts, and she 
knew she had killed them all. Her Walther was in her hand, a lightness 
at her back suggesting she&#39;d unloaded the spare clips she&#39;d tucked there 
without realizing it. There was a smear of something on her cheek, light 
enough that it had to be blood. Some distant part of her mind was 
grateful it wasn&#39;t thicker. Wiping scrambled brains from skin was never 
an easy or pleasant task, and the smell usually lingered for quite a 
while.

Her ears had &#39;returned&#39; next, filled with mostly silence, though the 
steady, pattering drips of blood were entwined with the faded echoes of 
tortured, terrified screams. There didn&#39;t seem to be anyone alive in the 
room &#150; at least, no one she recognized as an enemy. But there was 
someone breathing nearby, a rough and uneven noise she recognized deep 
in her gut. The name had been immediate, threading her consciousness 
with urgent anxiety. Kirika &#150;

In spite of the relief rising hot and hard in her chest, the turn to 
look across the room had been slow, almost negligent, her weapon held 
automatically in that direction as though it might yet find a target. 
Kirika had been standing almost flush against the far wall. Or perhaps 
standing was the wrong word; thick leather straps around her raised 
wrists were twisted over an exposed beam in the ceiling, dangling her 
small form like a piece of fresh meat. The litter of fallen foes was 
smaller here, only three or four slumped at her dark-booted feet. She 
was conscious, head lifted and lips slightly parted. Her gorgeous eyes 
were wide, stunned and perhaps a bit frightened, their rust color more 
vivid than usual against her paled skin. Her voice was rough, pained. 
&quot;Mireyu?&quot;

That softly accented name, said the way only Kirika could, was enough to 
temporarily shred the traces of whatever strangeness had gripped her. 
The Walther dropped slightly, and she swiftly flicked the safety on, 
tucking it back in the shoulder holster as she kicked aside the bodies 
in her path. &quot;Kirika.&quot; She breathed her partner&#39;s name without meaning 
to, strides quick across the stained floor. Kirika flinched at the 
blonde&#39;s first touch to the ropes, shying away before realizing it was a 
rescue, not an attack. The younger woman was obviously dazed and 
hurting, muscles across her body wracked with small spasms again and 
again. She seemed to be drifting in and out. &quot;Mirelle . . . eyes . . . 
Chloe . . . &quot;

At the time, the rasped words hadn&#39;t made much sense. Distantly, she&#39;d 
felt a flash of dark, confused anger and jealousy as she pulled hard on 
the stiff knots. The straps came free in a few seconds, and Kirika 
slumped weakly against her, body limp like Jell-O. Not that it mattered; 
Mirelle would carry her small partner from this hell in a heartbeat if 
need be. Still, the disjointed phrase had rankled her while she lifted 
the Japanese girl&#39;s light frame into her arms. Had Kirika really thought 
Chloe had come back from the dead to save her? She hadn&#39;t believed 
Mirelle would come?

Back in the present, the Corsican&#39;s large eyes grew distant and dark 
with thought, light fingers trailing up and down Kirika&#39;s bare shoulder 
once more. It hadn&#39;t been until they were in the car, pushing the speed 
limit to its thinnest edge with the younger woman nestled safe against 
her, that she realized what her partner had meant. That was one of the 
things they had talked about, during those long hours of recovery. The 
way Kirika&#39;s eyes had changed in the heat of their most intense battles, 
especially during their fight at the Manor. How they&#39;d mimicked Chloe&#39;s 
eyes &#150; so full of blood-drenched darkness, without mercy or emotion &#150; 
just the way her reactions did. The &#39;true Noir&#39; eyes, Mirelle had 
commented sardonically. It was a realization that struck the blonde like 
a bolt of lightning. Kirika hadn&#39;t been saying she saw Chloe&#39;s eyes; 
she&#39;d been trying to tell Mirelle her eyes had changed, just like 
Chloe&#39;s.

Was that why Kirika had been so scared to look at her? Mirelle sighed, 
sapphire gaze softening as she looked down at that delicate sleeping 
face. So different, and yet, the features were as intimately familiar as 
her own reflection. &quot;Mon petit idiot.&quot; She whispered, the soft words no 
more than a warm breath of sound. As though she would ever hurt the 
younger woman.

You hurt her earlier. You slapped her and made her cry.

Mirelle shook the mental voice away, arms unconsciously tightening 
around Kirika. She didn&#39;t have the energy left to argue with herself. 
Yeah, I know. I&#39;m a nasty, selfish bitch, I&#39;m a lousy partner that 
doesn&#39;t deserve her. Happy now?

The voice was silent for a moment. Yes, you can be a nasty bitch on 
occasion, and you&#39;ve certainly got the selfish part down, but I&#39;m not 
sure the last part applies as well as you might think.

What the hell are you talking about? Mirelle not-quite buried her face 
in Kirika&#39;s thick dark hair, breathing the scent like a comforter. She 
knew she shouldn&#39;t, she knew it was impulsive and stupid, but she 
couldn&#39;t help it. I almost got her killed!

And you saved her. You&#39;d have ripped the world apart to get her back. 
How many men did you kill?

I &#150; I don&#39;t know. Mirelle hesitated. Something had happened when she was 
talking with Alexander, something that made her memories strangely hazy. 
She knew she&#39;d killed him, that she spoken with Breffort and Lisa and 
that they&#39;d told her where to find Kirika. And she knew that she&#39;d 
killed every Soldat she&#39;d come across in the manor home. But how she&#39;d 
done it, the specifics, she couldn&#39;t fully remember. Only that they were 
dead, and at her hand. They hurt her. They &#150;

Were between you and Kirika. The voice prompted helpfully. Which is 
exactly the point. You may not be able to admit your emotions, but you 
still feel them, even stronger than usual when you enter that state. You 
adore Kirika, you lo &#150;

Shut up. The reaction was instant and intense, Mirelle&#39;s throat going 
tight. I don&#39;t &#150; that&#39;s not what it is.

That couldn&#39;t be what it was. A sinking feeling took over the pit of her 
stomach even as she cradled that lean form tighter to her. That just 
couldn&#39;t be right, could it?

There was a moment of silence, then a mental sigh. If you say so. At 
least you had the common sense to get her back. Would&#39;ve been a long 
night without her, wouldn&#39;t it?

Pain in the ass. A yawn slipped out, wide enough to make the blonde&#39;s 
eyes flutter. If she wanted to be honest with herself, Mirelle knew she 
was nearly as exhausted as Kirika, sans the lingering effects of the 
drugs. It was only worry about her partner&#39;s condition that had kept her 
awake this long. Now that she knew Kirika was alright, it was all she 
could do to keep her eyes open.

That&#39;s probably why I&#39;m arguing with myself. I&#39;m too tired.

Careful not to disturb the sleeping younger woman, Mirelle shifted the 
pillows slightly to a more comfortable position, one arm still wrapped 
around Kirika&#39;s shoulders. The next time the smaller girl woke, it 
wouldn&#39;t be alone. Another deep yawn, and the Corsican&#39;s eyes slipped 
shut, tense muscles relaxing completely as she drifted under. Her last 
conscious thought was of Kirika, that slender frame pressed so gently to 
her chest. A smile touched her lips, slow and sweet. Sleep tight, 
Kirika.

I&#39;ll protect you, I swear.



Mireyu &#150;

Kirika woke in the deep, soothing darkness that wasn&#39;t quite dawn, 
wondering why her mind had pulled itself back to the land of the living. 
Judging by the shadows that still blanketed the room, it was a few hours 
after her nightmare &#150; nowhere near morning yet. Puzzled, she lay still 
for a few seconds, trying to figure out exactly what had tugged her 
awake. There were no unexpected noises outside, nothing that would pull 
her from sleep . . . the bed was nice and warm, and she was so safe and 
content, though she couldn&#39;t remember exactly why . . .

A low, strained sound from behind her brought the Asian assassin&#39;s last 
waking moments roaring back. Mirelle! Mirelle had comforted her from her 
terrifying nightmares, held her and promised to stay with her while she 
slept. It was the blonde&#39;s elegant hand clutching her shoulder, the 
quiet whimper and shifting tension that had chased away sleep. Worry 
jolted through the younger woman like a shot. What was wrong with 
Mirelle? Why was she crying?

Carefully, Kirika rolled over, her earlier fear of seeing those inhuman 
eyes overruled by concern for her partner. Mirelle lay just behind her, 
no more than a few inches away, obviously still asleep and dreaming. The 
expression on her face was haunting, mesmerizing; eyebrows snapped 
sharply together, skin pale as fallen snow, full mouth thinned and 
twisted in a sharp look of terror and pain. Tension radiated from her 
lithe body, muscles wound so tight she seemed ready to snap. Her free 
hand was fisted so hard in the sheets the knuckles shone white, and 
tears glimmered on her lashes like caught diamonds. She was whispering 
something, voice a husky, almost sobbing sound.

&quot;Kirika, no &#150; don&#39;t, please, don&#39;t leave me &#150; &quot;

The words hit her unsuspecting partner with the force of a sledgehammer. 
Stunned, Kirika&#39;s body froze motionless, hardly daring to breathe. 
Mirelle was dreaming about her? Dreaming about her leaving, and it made 
her this upset? The thought was so shocking, the younger woman wondered 
for a moment if she was still asleep. Her stomach fluttered oddly, 
warmth flooding through her veins. Mirelle really cared that much?

Another soft whimper tugged at her heart as the Corsican assassin 
shuddered, elegant hand slipping from Kirika&#39;s shoulder to clutch at 
empty air. &quot;Kirika?&quot; Her murmur was hoarse, aching. &quot;Kirika, please &#150; &quot;

Kirika didn&#39;t dare twitch, sudden instinct keeping her absolutely still 
instead of waking Mirelle from such obvious horror. The blonde&#39;s hand 
twisted on the mattress between them, searching in vain for some sort of 
contact with her partner. Outside their skins, the world seemed faint 
and far away, waiting with bated breath. Which one of them would break 
first?

Still, Kirika never expected the reaction that came after a few frozen 
seconds. Mirelle&#39;s face seemed to collapse in on itself, all sharp 
angles and contrasts of shadow and harsh moonlight. An agonized shudder 
wracked her lean frame, porcelain limbs trembling beneath the thin 
sheets, tears raining like lost stardust across the pillows. Her throat 
spasmed with a low, choking cry, wordless, but full of such pure grief 
it could have shattered stone. &quot;Kirika, no! Kirika!&quot;

The blonde&#39;s head fell forward, body curling in on itself, weeping as if 
her heart were broken. Kirika couldn&#39;t take the sight anymore. Lifting 
Mirelle&#39;s tight fist in her own hand, she shifted the last few inches 
between them, until she could tuck herself firmly once more against the 
Corsican beauty. One arm slipped around the blonde&#39;s waist, the other 
holding Mirelle&#39;s tight to her chest, willing her partner to feel the 
touch. Eyes burning, she spoke huskily, words breathed against Mirelle&#39;s 
neck. &quot;Shhhh, Mireyu. I&#39;m here, I&#39;m here.&quot; Her smaller hand stroked the 
blonde&#39;s clenched fingers over and over, soothing the brittle, anguished 
tension she found there. Nestled this way, her head fit perfectly 
beneath Mirelle&#39;s chin, and she could feel the tears trickling down 
through her hair in warm, damp streams. Anguished suffering, made real 
and physical. It only tore her heart further. &quot;Mirelle, I&#39;m here. I 
won&#39;t ever leave you. I won&#39;t.&quot;

Mirelle stiffened for a moment, still dreaming, nerves still fraught 
with fear. Then, with a final convulsive shiver, the blonde assassin 
melted into Kirika&#39;s arms, her pained sobs trailing off to a soft 
sniffling. Her fist unclenched, shaken fingers interlacing with her 
partner&#39;s and clinging so tightly it almost hurt. Kirika didn&#39;t care. 
Her other hand trailed up and down Mirelle&#39;s back, tracing her spine 
through the thin fabric of the oversized white shirt. Pressing close, 
head tucked against the Corsican&#39;s shoulder, the younger woman found 
herself murmuring softly in Japanese. Just as Mirelle had earlier. &quot;It&#39;s 
safe, Mireyu. You don&#39;t have to be afraid. I&#39;m here with you. I&#39;m here.&quot;

With one last, low whimper, the blonde buried her face in Kirika&#39;s 
thick, dark hair, the trembling of her lean body quieting. Her slowed 
crying stopped, breaths growing deep and even once more as she drifted 
back into normal sleep. Kirika lay still beside her, arms wrapped gently 
around her partner, still absently stroking the Corsican&#39;s back. Her 
mind was too full to sleep just yet. Why was Mirelle dreaming about her 
leaving? Why would she have such a terrible reaction to it? What could 
terrify her like this?

It was just so strange and confusing. Just like the rest of their 
relationship, Kirika thought wryly, careful not to disturb the her 
exhausted partner. Every time she thought she understood what was 
between them, something happened to throw everything into a mess again. 
Like this afternoon, when she was absolutely sure that this was it, they 
were through with each other &#150;

&#150; but Mirelle had saved her, even when she didn&#39;t feel like she deserved 
to be saved. Kirika&#39;s throat tightened. Mirelle had come after her, 
carried her from the death-trap, made certain her wounds were treated 
and comforted her in her nightmares. It was another of those things that 
brought more questions than it answered, like the blonde&#39;s terrifying 
dreams. If Mirelle was angry enough to strike her earlier, why had she 
risked herself to save the young woman only hours later? Mirelle might 
as well have told Kirika to leave, but the thought frightened her enough 
to give her full-blown nightmares?

Kirika sighed and curled herself tighter against her partner, shoving 
the whole thing resolutely from her mind. She knew this day had changed 
them both &#150; it would take a fool to believe otherwise, and above all, 
Kirika was no fool. But how it would change them, or if those changes 
would stay, she had no idea. For now, she was content simply to comfort 
Mirelle, hold her as she slept and feel the same warm, comforting 
protection in the blonde&#39;s arms.

Unraveling could wait until morning.

Muahahahahaha, buttkicking, angst and fluff! I looooove it! (glee) And 
the translation for Mirelle&#39;s limo comments are as follows:

&quot; . . . p&egrave; e . . . donne dui . . . a manu neru se securit&agrave;.&quot; Literally, 
&quot;Of . . . two maidens . . . black hands keep safe.&quot; She&#39;s reciting the 
Noir litany in Corsican.

&quot;scusate tante &ucirc;n la s&ocirc;, &ucirc;n capiscu mica.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t know, 
I didn&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;Mon scuru ange.&quot; French and Corsican mix here. &quot;Mon ange&quot; is &quot;my 
angel,&quot; &quot;scuru&quot; is Corsican for dark. Thus, &quot;My dark angel.&quot;

&quot;Vous &ecirc;tes les miens . . . je vous prot&egrave;grai.&quot; French here - &quot;You are 
mine . . . I&#39;ll protect you.&quot;

&quot;per piac&egrave;, per piac&egrave;, &ecirc;tre bien.&quot; Another French / Corsican mix. &quot;per 
piac&egrave;&quot; is &quot;please&quot; in Corsican, &quot;&ecirc;tre bien&quot; is &quot;be okay&quot; in French. So 
&quot;Please, please, be okay.&quot;

And, finally, the lovely Noir rote in French: &quot;c&#39;est le nom d&#39;un destin 
antique. Deux demoiselles qui r&eacute;gissent la mort. La paix nouvellement du 
soutenu, leurs mains noires se prot&egrave;gent.&quot; Literally, &quot;It is the name of 
an ancient fate. Two maidens who govern death. The peace of the newly 
born, their black hands protect.&quot;</pre>
