double over.

&quot;It&#39;s the truth, Kirika. I made a lot of calls last night- all over 
Corsica. Every last person who knew my family from that time, told me 
the same thing: Dumond is my godfather.&quot;

I feel as if a knife is twisting in my stomach. Dumond and Mireille. The 
thing that Soldats fears most. I slide down the wall to the floor, my 
head in my hands. This cannot happen, it must not happen.

&quot;No wonder he taunted me like that, walking in there with Soldats. It 
must have been a slap in the face.&quot;she shakes her head. I remember our 
visit to Lacion prison; even then, the way Droger and Mireille had 
looked at each other had made me uneasy.

Dumond and Mireille. I pull myself up slowly, the pain in my stomach 
still cutting into me. She has to stop, she has to stop now. I gingerly 
make my way towards her.

&quot;How very fitting.&quot; She pulls the curtains back, flooding the room with 
light. I stop, batting my eyes quickly at the invading sun.

&quot;In the end, my father was not so foolish after all. For what he could 
not do, he chose my godfather to do; strike the very heart of Soldats 
and destroy them.&quot; She runs her hands up and down the edge of the 
curtain in way that seems familiar to me.

&quot;The whole time he&#39;s been in exile- he&#39;s been planning and building for 
this. In a few days, he will be free- free to complete his mission.&quot;

Silhouetted in the sun, she reminds me of Droger now, in her long gown, 
running her hands along the curtain the same way he had run his over the 
prison bars.

&quot;Mireille- don&#39;t do this. It&#39;s crazy.&quot; I beg her softly. She drops her 
hands and turns to look at me.

&quot;It&#39;s not any more crazy than you and your nightmare room is it?&quot; her 
voice is sharp

&quot;That&#39;s different!&quot; I feel the anger well up in me. &quot;That room is the 
key to my past!&quot;

&quot;That room is killing you- it&#39;s a noose around your neck!&quot; she snorts 
angrily.

&quot;And Droger is a noose around yours!&quot; I shoot back.

&quot;What&#39;s going on in there?&quot; Uncle&#39;s voice thunders from outside the 
door, making us both jump.

&quot;None of your business!&quot; Mireille shouts.

&quot;Mireille! Stop it!&quot; I stamp my foot, sending a sharp pain through my 
belly.

&quot;Kirika, are you okay in there?&quot; Uncle&#39;s voice sounds worried. Mireille 
scowls.

&quot;Go on. Your precious Uncle is worried about you.&quot; she dismisses me.

&quot;But Mireille....&quot; I want to talk to her, to talk her out of this 
suicidal trap.

&quot;Go on- we&#39;ll talk more about it later.&quot; She shoves me out the door.
