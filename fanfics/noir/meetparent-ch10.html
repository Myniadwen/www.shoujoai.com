<h1>Meet the Parent (part 10 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Simply bringing the medicine kit in hurry to the room, Kirika gasped at 
the view of Mireille, laid down unconscious on the floor. Carefully the 
Japanese girl carried up the blonde and quickly laid her on bed. The 
blonde&#39;s wound was cleaned and bandaged by the brunette after. Kirika 
was unsurprisingly well trained on it, as she wrapped the blonde&#39;s left 
arm deliberately.

An hour had passed, and finally Mireille showed the sign of regain 
consciousness. The blonde moved her body slightly, and slowly opened up 
her eyes.

&quot;You have awaken..&quot; whispered the brunette in relief.

Mireille, still laying down, glanced to her right where she heard the 
voice.

Saw Kirika silently sitting beside her, waiting for her, the blonde 
smiled weakly. &quot;Kirika..&quot; She looked at her arm which was bandaged 
neatly. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;It seems that you lost too many blood..&quot; said Kirika, smiling. &quot;.. 
that&#39;s why you suddenly felt dizzy and all.&quot;

Mireille put her right arm on the bed and pushed it to help her sat. 
Quite deep as the wound was already, Mireille did slightly felt a pain 
just for sit, tough the Japanese girl already helped her.

&quot;Does it hurt much..?&quot; asked the Japanese girl.

&quot;Yeah, a bit. But I&#39;m okay.&quot; Mireille said, as she finally made herself 
comfortable. &quot;How did you bring me here..?&quot;

&quot;I carried you.&quot; the brunette answered calmly.

Carried me..? The thought that she was carried by Kirika, made Mireille 
flushed a little.

&quot;Aren&#39;t I.. heavy..?&quot; she asked, shy. She knew tough, that the brunette 
surely wasn&#39;t weak at all on physical strength, despite her tiny 
appearance.

Kirika chuckled. &quot;Not.. really.&quot;

Still flushing, Mireille glanced at her left arm. &quot;Did someone ask 
anything.. about what happened..?&quot;

&quot;An old lady came over and asked.&quot; replied Kirika. &quot;I told her we were 
simply fighting.&quot;

&quot;Fighting..? Did she believe you..?&quot;

The Japanese girl nodded quietly.

&quot;Any others..?&quot;

&quot;.. No.. Not yet.&quot;

The blonde let out a sigh. &quot;Your innocent face surely helps a lot.&quot; she 
said. &quot;How&#39;s the room..?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.. badly damaged.&quot;

&quot;I see..&quot;

A gap of silence was created between them for some minutes, before the 
Japanese girl finally decided to speak up.

Hesitation showed in her voice, Kirika asked, &quot;What was.. she talking 
about with you..?&quot;

&quot;..She challenged me on a duel.&quot;

Kirika looked seriously at the blonde. &quot;I know.. that.&quot;

&quot;Uh.. I refused to do that, and she became angry.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why she attacked you..?&quot; asked the brunette sharply.

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Mireille looked away from the Japanese girl. She hoped her 
gesture would make Kirika realized that she didn&#39;t want to talk about it 
further, tough Mireille herself didn&#39;t know why. Talking about Chloe 
simply not on her favourite things to do list.

Oblivious, the Japanese girl asked in confusion, &quot;Why did.. she 
challenge you, Mireille..?&quot;

&quot;..Dunno.&quot; murmured the blonde.

Unfortunate for the blonde, Kirika was in the mood to know something. 
Consider how bizarre the situation had gotten, the brunette raised her 
eyebrows slightly. &quot;Are you.. hiding something..?&quot;

&quot;..No.&quot;

The brunette launched her assault right after, as she gave the Corsican 
girl one of her icy stares, directed right to the blonde&#39;s blue eyes. 
Pushed under the brunette&#39;s cold eyes icy pressure, Mireille avoided the 
eye contact and tried her best to act like she was suffering from her 
wound. Quickly and almost spontaneously, the blonde touched her left arm 
where the wound was and whispered some words of pain.

&quot;Ugh..!&quot; Just help me.. Kirika..!

Unfortunately, her act failed miserably, as she was ignored completely 
by the brunette. Not even moved an inch from her current position, 
Kirika&#39;s brown orbs still calmly stared at Mireille&#39;s. Knew what her 
faith would be, the blonde decided to give up quickly in the end.

The Corsican girl heaved a long sighed. &quot;Looks like you win, like 
always.&quot; She looked at Kirika. &quot;What was it you asked..?&quot;

The Japanese girl smiled cheerfully, before started to look serious 
again.&quot;Why was she angry..?&quot;

&quot;I refused to talk to her. I don&#39;t want to do the fight.&quot;

&quot;Why did.. she suddenly challenge you to fight her..?&quot; Kirika gave a 
look of questioning. &quot;There.. must be a reason.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s..&quot; Mireille muttered. &quot;maybe, she... wants you.&quot;

&quot;Huh..?&quot; the Japanese girl asked, puzzled.

&quot;She wants to protect you.&quot; said Mireille. &quot;She said the winner will be 
the one qualified to protect you.&quot;

The Japanese girl looked at the blonde. &quot;Protect me..?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Seems like she wants to do it.. so much.&quot;

Kirika looked confused. &quot;Why..?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Mireille said, lying. She knew exactly that Chloe would 
happily die if it&#39;s for the brown haired girl&#39;s sake. &quot;She kept 
insisting, tough I told her that you are already good for yourself. You 
don&#39;t need her, in other words.&quot;

To the blonde&#39;s surprise, Kirika suddenly muttered. &quot;Am I..?&quot;

Mireille said no word, and simply looked at Kirika. Hasn&#39;t she ever 
thought that she is capable enough..?

&quot;..Mireille.&quot; the Japanese girl&#39;s soft voice made the blonde looked at 
her right, caused her eyes met the brunette&#39;s beautiful brown orbs. 
&quot;Don&#39;t you feel the need.. to protect me..?&quot; Kirika asked the question 
timidly.

Mireille&#39;s eyes turned wider in confusion. &quot;..Hah?&quot;

What..?! It&#39;s not..

Mireille became speechless, and lost at words. She did say that Kirika 
didn&#39;t need someone like Chloe to protect her. But that was just in 
order to make the purple haired girl lost and realized her stupid 
purpose. The blonde knew that she herself would gladly protect the 
brunette, with or without asked. Too occupied by her inner thought and 
shocked by the sudden question, the blonde unconsciously stared on 
blankly. The blonde hardly thought about the answer she should give.

Meanwhile, the Japanese girl kept looking at the Corsican girl, her 
brown orbs glimmered, waiting an answer. As Mireille&#39;s brain refused to 
give out a proper answer and she hadn&#39;t yet given a word to reply, the 
brunette&#39;s glimmering eyes slowly faded, replaced by sadness. The 
Japanese girl lowered her head and smiled sadly, sooth herself.

&quot;.. Sorry. Weird question.&quot; Kirika said, as she pulled herself up, 
prepared to stand up and left the room. &quot;I&#39;ll make tea for you.&quot;

Kirika was about to walk on but stopped when suddenly she felt the 
blonde&#39;s hand reached hers. Seemed like Mireille hadn&#39;t allowed the 
Japanese looking girl to leave her just yet.

&quot;No.. Uh.. Wait.&quot; Mireille murmured softly. She unconsciously pulled 
Kirika to sit back. Geez..! What made me think that long..!?

The brunette looked at the blonde in confusion, but once again sat 
beside the blonde, hand clutched still.

Mireille gulped, braved herself and gazed at the brown orbs next to her. 
&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care about you, Kirika..&quot; she said softly, 
finally regained an answer.

The brunette didn&#39;t reply, and listened obediently.

&quot;Just for you know.. I..&quot; the blonde lowered her voice at almost the 
lowest stage. A whisper would definitely make a louder noise, if 
compared with the word Mireille took a really long time to say. &quot;really 
care for you..&quot;

The Japanese girl somehow seemed to catch the words said, and smiled 
happily. &quot;Really..?&quot;

&quot;Yeah..&quot; the blonde muttered.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Kirika smiled beautifully at Mireille.

The blonde blushed a little and grumbled some unclear words, which meant 
for herself only.

&quot;Uh, Mireille..&quot; the Japanese looking girl whispered softly. &quot;You said.. 
that a feeling of care count, right..?&quot;

Mireille suddenly felt her body heat increased thousand times. She could 
feel that her cheeks became hotter, her heart also pounded even faster 
it could have easily heard by anybody who listened closely at her heart 
beat. Just to hide her deep red face, Mireille avoided the brunette&#39;s 
gaze and looked down to her bed. Have I just confessed.. to her..??

The blonde tried to keep her cool, tough was fooled by her stuttered 
voice. &quot;Ye.. Yeah.. Why?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just..&quot; Kirika whispered in a soft tone. &quot;I kind of.. finally 
recognized the feeling of love.. by caring.&quot;

&quot;Oh..&quot; The blonde hadn&#39;t dared to look at Kirika, despite her curious 
urge to see what the brunette would look like right now.

Mireille waited Kirika to say more, and decided to shut her mouth for a 
while. Time passed and silence hung between them, yet no one spoke up. 
Mireille stole a glance at the Japanese girl and to her surprise, found 
the brunette somehow had a little wrinkle on her forehead. In deep 
thought, the brunette must be.

&quot;Kirika..?&quot; the blonde decided to ask.

The younger of the two finally looked up right into the blonde&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;Er..&quot; She whispered timidly to the blonde, &quot;..Is it possible for me..&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Mireille asked, no longer patient, as confusion and curiousity 
were all mixed in her head.

Then, Mireille REALLY saw Kirika flushed. The brunette&#39;s cheek turned 
red, which was adorable for sure, in the blonde&#39;s opinion. Once again 
Mireille got to kill her urge to leaned over and kiss the brunette. She 
couldn&#39;t help but only silently enjoy the view in front of her, instead 
of passionately showing what she really felt.

The Japanese girl seemed to be really nervous to look at Mireille, while 
her little voice turned to another lower level of sound.

&quot;Fall in love..&quot; she whispered shyly. &quot;with you..?&quot;

&quot;Eh..?&quot; the blonde stupidly launched the first word she came up with.

The blonde&#39;s eyes opened wider. Thinking under great confusion, Mireille 
thought that she was imagining things, all because she was too attracted 
to the brunette&#39;s cute and adorable face.

To the blonde&#39;s even more confusion, Kirika didn&#39;t reply her, and rather 
her cute blush got even worst redder she could had blown out her head if 
it could explode.

Wasn&#39; t it my imagination..?? Why is she blushing... so hard..??

Mireille blinked. &quot;Did you just say that.. you.. love me..?&quot;

&quot;I just &#145;asked&#39; if that&#39;s possible..&quot; the Japanese girl muttered cutely. 
&quot;I don&#39;t say I really feel it.&quot; she added quickly and looked up to see 
the blonde&#39;s face.

All of the sudden, Mireille felt a miracle shone upon her, which somehow 
led her heart to a proper self-confidence. The blonde smiled gracefully. 
The urge to seduce the brunette now was spreading inside her, and 
completely contagious. She decided to lean closer to Kirika and gently 
squeezed the younger one&#39;s hand.

&quot;It&#39;s possible, I think..&quot; Mireille said calmly, smiling. The blonde 
then gazed at Kirika&#39;s tomato red face. &quot;Maybe you can help me tell the 
exact answer, by telling me what you feel.. &quot; she leaned forward and 
made their face got really close they could easily have kissed each 
other. &quot;when you&#39;re this close with me..?&quot;

Kirika obviously surprised and almost jumped at the sudden close 
contact, as her red cheeks turned redder, and moved her head a step 
back.

Despite her calm facial look, deep in the heart Mireille could feel that 
her heart was also beating faster at every move she made toward Kirika. 
She herself also didn&#39;t know where she got the guts to do that, as she 
simply enjoyed teasing the Japanese girl, suddenly.

Mireille smiled to herself. I got to remember that she smells so nice..

Almost unconsciously, their eyes locked onto each other, both simply 
amazed by how beautiful those other eyes were, tough no words of praise 
came out from their mouth. The two of them gazed onto each other for a 
long time, before the Japanese girl cut off the eye contact by saying 
words.

&quot;You.. enjoy this..&quot; Kirika stuttered, still blushing madly. The 
Japanese girl lowered her head, obviously avoided direct contact from 
Mireille&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You want to kiss me..,don&#39;t you?&quot; Mireille whispered naughtily.

Kirika made no answer, but the blonde could vaguely see that a small nod 
was made by the brunette. The blonde grinned in happiness. She leaned 
forward to kiss her secret love slowly, closer and closer, regardless of 
the pain she felt whenever she moved her left arm. Closing the distance, 
now it&#39;s not even a centimeter left for her lips to reach Kirika&#39;s for 
the first time.

Unfortunately Mireille&#39;s action was interrupted.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it you.. who want to kiss me..?&quot; a voice suddenly heard.

The Japanese girl&#39;s abrupt sentence was no doubt timid, but at the same 
time sharp. Mireille didn&#39;t expect the Japanese girl to speak so sudden 
at THAT time. However, the action had forced the blonde to stop her 
move.

&quot;No.&quot; Mireille quickly answered and turned her head back to where it 
was, as she slowly felt her cheeks once again became hotter. She cleared 
her throat, disintegrating her sloppy and embarrassing action.

Unfortunately, Kirika realized the nervousness in the blonde&#39;s answer. 
The brunette hesitated to ask at first, as she kept silent for a while. 
But later, after seeing that the blonde was trying so hard to hide her 
face whose flushing, the Japanese girl smiled in victory and asked 
innocently, emphasizing her cute adorable look.

&quot;Sure..?&quot; Kirika asked slowly in an innocent tone, rather seducing, 
tough.

Mireille stole a quick glance at Kirika, who was now smiling to her. Did 
she do that on purpose..??!

The blonde knew that she was lost, as she realized that she was now the 
one whose cheeks as red as tomato, while Kirika was the one smiling 
gratefully in satisfaction. Too embarrassed to say a word and admit her 
defeat, Mireille shut her mouth.

&quot;Mireille..?&quot; Kirika softly asked. &quot;Do you.. love me..?&quot;

&quot;Err.. &quot; mumbled the blonde, still afraid to just blurt out what she 
felt, regardless of her mad heart which beating very quickly.

As if she didn&#39;t mean to ask the question, the Japanese girl kept 
talking tough rather for herself, and didn&#39;t wait for Mireille to answer 
her question.

&quot;I don&#39;t know actually, how to be loved by someone..&quot; Kirika said softly 
in a low voice meant not to be heard but by herself, as if hoping an 
unreachable dream.

Realized a pair of blue orbs simply watching her every word, Kirika 
looked back at Mireille, her eyes now desired an answer, as her lips 
simply twisted a smile.

Mireille gazed wordlessly at the Japanese girl.

As the Japanese girl was about to say something, Mireille suddenly 
leaned forward and hug Kirika, completely ignored or rather not felt the 
pain in her left arm.

&quot;Mi.. reille..?&quot; Kirika said, surprised, but didn&#39;t resist to be hugged.

The blonde said nothing, as this was her answer.

The embrace was not too close, as Mireille hesitated. Mireille could 
feel her heart stopped at the very sudden close contact she ever made 
with the brunette, despite their years living together.

She may not like this..

As the blonde was about to let go of the Japanese girl, she felt Kirika 
placed her hands back, circling Mireille&#39;s waist. Relief grew in her 
heart, Mireille hold the brunette back closer to her.

Mireille made up her mind and whispered right into the brunette&#39;s ear in 
a low voice, &quot;I.. do want to kiss you..&quot;

The Japanese girl smiled, tough Mireille couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;I do too, 
Mireille..&quot; Kirika said softly in a caressing tone.

The two of them, still hugging onto each other, and leaned closer to the 
other&#39;s face. As they were no longer separated by formal distance, and 
their nose was touching, they could hear and feel each other breath.

&quot;Have you.. kissed someone before..?&quot; Mireille asked softly, as she 
enjoyed feeling the rhythm of Kirika&#39;s steady breath, as well as the 
closeness.

Kirika shook her head shyly, as her cheeks slowly turned to its red 
form.

Mireille smiled, and cup the Japanese girl&#39;s face with her hands. Then, 
she placed her lips on Kirika&#39;s soft and small lips, gave the brunette a 
long, passionate kiss. Kirika&#39;s body and lips tensed at first but began 
to relax at last, after felt how gentle Mireille was with her action. 
They kissed romantically, as each of them moaned softly.

Once they stopped to take a breath, Mireille whispered naughtily, &quot;Like 
it..?&quot;

Kirika replied with a small nod, as she licked her lips slowly, and sexy 
in Mireille&#39;s opinion.

The blonde didn&#39;t waste time anymore, and kissed the Japanese girl one 
more time, this time more intimate and passionate than before.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Mireille said, in the middle of their romantic scene, as 
she once again caught her breath.

&quot;I think I love you too, Mireille.&quot; the brunette whispered softly.

The blonde smiled and kissed Kirika, now on the forehead. Then, she 
pulled the Japanese girl towards her, motioned her to lie together in 
the bed. Simply brought closer to the blonde she loved, Kirika gladly 
followed. They laid together in bed, close one to another, hands on the 
latter&#39;s waist. That was the first time for the two of them, holding 
each other in such way. Mireille brushed Kirika&#39;s brown hair 
affectionately with her right hand, made the brunette gazed happily at 
the blonde&#39;s blue orbs.

&quot;Your left arm.. alright..?&quot;

Mireille smiled at the brunette. &quot;How can it not be alright..?&quot; she 
asked in a happy tone.

They smiled to each other as they leaned more and more closer, as in the 
end smiling peacefully while resting in bed.

----------------------------------------

Meanwhile in some place far from their apartment..

&quot;I believe I have told you before. Have not I..?&#39; a deep calm voice, 
fill in madness asked.

Regardless of the cold weather, and the darkness filled within the sky 
tonight, the woman led her little girl to walk with her, to talk outside 
in their special place. Their footsteps echoed down the hall of their 
big house, as they were the only one walking on.

The younger girl didn&#39;t answer and rather looked away from the woman in 
front of her, as she kept walking obediently. Told herself to deny the 
fear of the sharpness and coldness in the woman&#39;s tone, the girl decided 
to look up. She thought she didn&#39;t do anything wrong, after all.

The older woman heaved out a long sigh. &quot;Why did you carelessly go, my 
dear kid..? I cannot get it at all.&quot;

The younger girl murmured. &quot;I won&#39;t let anyone DO that.&quot;

&quot;Why..?&quot; the older woman asked, her long hairs flickered by the wind&#39;s 
blow, as they were now already stood in the garden outside.

Seeing the kid in front of her hadn&#39;t yet replied, the woman decided to 
spill out the name of the green cloaked girl. &quot;Chloe..?&quot;

Chloe looked up and meet Altena&#39;s gaze. &quot;I.. love her.&quot; She said, her 
eyes showed strong determination. &quot;That&#39;s why.&quot;

&quot;Love..&quot; Altena said, disgust in her heart, despite her smiling face. 
&quot;But still I cannot understand you, my child.&quot;

The purple haired girl kept her mouth shut and silent.

Still smiling horrifically, Altena calmly said. &quot;I will never hurt you, 
Chloe.&quot; The older woman gazed seriously, her eyes reflected sadness, or 
rather in Chloe&#39;s opinion, threat. &quot;Please, do not force me do so. Just 
by see you make any more of your..&quot; she paused. &quot;..ugly action.&quot;

Hesitation and scare mixed up in her heart, Chloe said nothing and 
avoided the older woman&#39;s sharp gaze. She would gladly obeyed every word 
Altena said to her, before. But things had changed and she no longer 
trust the older woman in front of her completely, tough she hate to 
admit the fear she encountered every time she saw the older girl&#39;s 
figure.

&quot;I hope you do understand what I said, my dearest kid.&quot;

With the last sentence, the beautiful well-mannered woman left the 
garden, leaving Chloe all alone, desperately confused.

&quot;Kirika..&quot; she murmured weakly.</pre>
