Dropping the file folder she&#39;d just grabbed back on the pool table, 
Mirelle winced and sucked at her newly-bloodied finger, muttering 
another startling selection of obscenities under her breath in several 
different dialects. After a few seconds, the bleeding stopped, and she 
examined the sliced, stinging flesh with a frustrated glare. Perfect. 
Absolutely perfect.

After last night, she&#39;d thought life truly was perfect. Being home with 
Kirika had been flat-out wonderful. She&#39;d showered with her new wash in 
no more than ten minutes &#150; a record for her &#150; then grabbed a pair of 
soft tan slacks and one of the button-down white shirts she usually wore 
to bed and the presents she&#39;d tucked into her bag. Kirika had set up 
their plates by then, complete with drinks and a few fresh-cut flowers 
in a vase on the table. Dinner had been beyond fabulous, each dish 
restaurant-quality. The snide voice in her head piped up, obscenely 
cheerful. You wouldn&#39;t have cared if it tasted like sawdust and lead.

Growling at herself, Mirelle snagged the file again and 
not-quite-stuffed it into a business-style carry case. The blonde 
Corsican had insisted on taking care of the dishes while Kirika made tea 
and served the pie. Not that there were many of them left; she&#39;d 
discovered her partner had washed and put away most of her utensils 
already. I thought she gave in too easy, the little sneak. Then the two 
of them had curled up on the couch with their dessert so Kirika could 
open her gifts. The look of awed glee on that delicate face had been 
worth all three days of garbage, as far as Mirelle was concerned. Each 
present &#150; the glittering glass sun-catcher in the shape of a dragon, the 
small stuffed cat holding a plush paint brush, the new novel and round 
pillow embroidered with the Kanji for &quot;peace&quot; &#150; was held up and cradled 
in her hands, with an expression of such surprise and happiness it had 
been touching.

Her mind flashed on the image of Kirika grinning shyly, the white and 
orange kitten plush perched on her shoulder, fingertips tracing the 
cover of the paperback in her lap and warm, liquid eyes seeming to stare 
straight into her soul. The thought sent an odd quiver of heat through 
her stomach, and her smirking subconscious gave a hoot of laughter. Oh, 
and you weren&#39;t out to get just that kind of response.

Mirelle throttled the urge to throw something across the room, tucking 
her cell phone in her pocket instead. Yes, the night had been perfect 
for the two of them, right down to the gentle hug she&#39;d given her little 
partner before flicking off the light. Kirika&#39;s pure happiness then had 
been almost breathable. Hell, they&#39;d even woken up with their hands 
touching, fingers curled against each other between them on the 
mattress. A dark frown twisted Mirelle&#39;s full mouth. She should have 
known it wouldn&#39;t last.

And it really hadn&#39;t lasted much beyond that glorious morning wakeup. 
They&#39;d been talking about what to do today after their meeting with her 
police informant, and Kirika had happened to mention that she&#39;d visited 
the new art store. And then she&#39;d mentioned her meeting with her new 
friend Alexander. Mirelle&#39;s lip curled in something very close to a 
snarl. It had been quite a shock, her little Kirika admitting to a 
friendship. Oh, she hadn&#39;t called him a friend &#150; just said very calmly 
that she&#39;d met him at the art store, and that he&#39;d talked with her a few 
days later and given her a ride &#150; but the blonde Corsican knew better. 
Kirika had the same look in her eyes that she&#39;d had when she first spoke 
about Milosh. A gentle light, that warming flicker in the depths of her 
gaze and a faint softening of her mouth. She cared about this young man.

All of which irritated Mirelle, a lot more than usual. Damnit, she 
should know to be careful! What if this boy is a Soldat, or someone else 
out to get the two of us? She was alone &#150; even armed, she should have 
known better!

And that was more or less what she&#39;d told Kirika, including Breffort&#39;s 
carefully-worded warning from the drive yesterday. The gentleness of her 
partner&#39;s sweet face had vanished instantly, lips thinning and shoulders 
tightening before she turned away to the bathroom. And their wonderful 
morning had disappeared behind cold walls of silence and frustration, 
irritation and hidden pain. A tingle of regret raced through Mirelle&#39;s 
chest, slamming head on into an answering wave of annoyance. It wasn&#39;t 
as though she was saying anything Kirika didn&#39;t already know already. 
Hell, they had been through this once already, and Mirelle refused to 
watch as the little bit of personality the Japanese young woman had 
carved out for herself disappear into self-loathing.

You didn&#39;t have to be so rude about it. Her mental voice retorted. Its 
tone was mocking. Then again, that&#39;s not the only reason why you got 
prickly, is it? You hate that anyone else could ever give her that happy 
look. It bothers you. A looooot. Just like it did when she made friends 
with Milosh. And heaven help if someone like Chloe came along &#150;

Mirelle clenched her jaw, shoving that thought from her consciousness. 
Alright, yes, it bothered her that Kirika might be growing away from 
her. They were partners! It was a given, damnit. They relied on each 
other for their lives! The image of Kirika&#39;s sad eyes intruded on her 
mind, and she sighed, her anger deflating suddenly. That still didn&#39;t 
mean she had to be a jerk about it. It wasn&#39;t Kirika&#39;s fault they were 
raised as they were, became what they were. Mirelle had managed a few 
casual friends, a semi-normal life before Kirika came along. She 
couldn&#39;t blame the younger woman for wanting the same.

As though on cue, Kirika slipped out of the bathroom, ducked head still 
damp from the shower. The small Japanese assassin trotted slowly toward 
the kitchen, avoiding her partner&#39;s gaze, every movement subdued and 
tense. It was a sight that made Mirelle&#39;s heart fall. &quot;Kirika?&quot;

The younger woman halted but didn&#39;t look up. Mirelle padded over and 
gently brushed the fringe of bangs away from Kirika&#39;s face, fingers 
soft, half expecting her hand to be slapped away. Instead, rust-red eyes 
rose slowly, pain and very faint anger darkening their depths. &quot;Yes?&quot;

Mirelle had to slam down her first instinct to chicken out. &quot;I&#39;m &#150; &quot; She 
paused. Apologies had never come easy for her, not even as a child. Now 
they were damned-near impossible. It was a weakness, a vulnerability, 
like soft emotions or trusting someone completely. Never mind that 
Kirika already hits all those. Her mental voice mocked. The Corsican 
locked that thought firmly away. She wasn&#39;t even sure what she was 
apologizing for, really. After all, she&#39;d meant every word of her 
warnings.

But still &#150;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I snapped at you.&quot; She pushed on before she lost her nerve 
completely. Her voice was clipped, strong and offhand, calm as though 
she were stating everyday facts. It was almost believable. &quot;And I&#39;m 
sorry &#150; I made you feel bad. I didn&#39;t want to.&quot;

God, how stupid does that sound? Mirelle winced inwardly. She sounded 
like some kind of naughty, petulant child. For a moment, she was tempted 
to can the whole idiotic idea. They&#39;d gotten over worse problems, after 
all &#150; compared to Soldats and Altena, a spat over some fool in an art 
shop was just . . . stupid. It wasn&#39;t like this would make or break 
their partnership or some nonsense like that.

But there was surprise in Kirika&#39;s eyes now, flickering across her face 
briefly before it melted away, taking some of the anger and hurt with 
it. Her eyes lightened, just a little; the corners of her lips curled up 
slightly, a faint, almost trembling smile. The warm brightness made 
Mirelle&#39;s heart skip a beat, softening her resolve to stay cool and 
collected. More words tumbled free before she even realized it. &quot;I just 
don&#39;t want you to get hurt.&quot; Again, her fingers trailed gently through 
Kirika&#39;s hair, the gesture as soothing to the blonde Corsican as it was 
to her partner. &quot;You don&#39;t deserve that.&quot;

Kirika wondered if her own heart had stopped entirely. Mirelle was 
apologizing? That just didn&#39;t happen. Oh, she&#39;d said &quot;sorry&quot; on 
occasion, if she got in Kirika&#39;s way or something like that. But the 
younger woman knew it was incredibly hard for her partner to admit any 
mistake. And to not only apologize for hurting Kirika, but to admit she 
cared about Kirika&#39;s feelings?

It&#39;s a dream, it has to be.

Mirelle was looking down at her, almost anxiously, her hand paused 
half-through Kirika&#39;s dark locks. The bare edge of worry in those azure 
eyes was enough. Reaching up, the Japanese assassin caught Mirelle&#39;s 
elegant fingers in her own. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Mireyu. I understand.&quot; And 
she did, in all truth. Mirelle hadn&#39;t really been saying anything she 
hadn&#39;t already thought herself. It had only been the way she&#39;d said it 
that was painful to hear. &quot;And &#150; and thank you. For caring.&quot;

The Corsican&#39;s pale face warmed, and for just a moment, Kirika could 
have sworn she caught the briefest flash of heat glowing in the depths 
of her gaze, the embers of a smoldering emotion she&#39;d never seen in 
Mirelle before. Then it was gone, the usual smirk settled firmly on 
those full lips as Mirelle squeezed their joined hands once before 
letting go. Tossing her head, she turned aside to look for her purse, 
voice casual and saucy. &quot;Yeah, well, don&#39;t forget it.&quot;

Kirika managed not to laugh out loud, but it was a very near thing. 
Instead, she gave a cheerful sound of agreement, reaching over to 
collect both her coat and Mirelle&#39;s pale brown purse from atop the 
half-wall. The blonde Corsican&#39;s eyebrow quirked, taking the offered 
leather handbag and settling it over her shoulder. Her sapphire eyes ran 
over their outfits critically. Kirika had chosen dark blue jeans and 
sneakers, matching the long-sleeved dusty blue shirt beneath her gray 
V-necked pullover. Her jacket was a brown leather one Mirelle had picked 
out especially for her, the one with soft sheepskin lining that brought 
out the vibrant color of her skin and eyes.

Amazingly, they matched rather well, although they&#39;d both chosen their 
clothes separately. Like her partner, Mirelle had picked jeans and 
sneakers, hers a slightly lighter shade of blue. The silken, sleeveless 
top she wore was deep green, a filmy gray scarf tied around her waist 
like a belt, her long leather coat a darker brown than Kirika&#39;s. Casual, 
but well put together, and quite stylish. Mirelle nodded firmly, 
pleased. &quot;We look good. Come on, let&#39;s go. Andre&#39;s probably at the caf&eacute; 
already.&quot;

---------------------------------------------

Andre Bridges &#150; twenty-eight years old, detective second grade of the 
Western Paris Precinct &#150; sprawled comfortably in one of the hard-backed 
chairs outside the Solar Caf&eacute;, sipping at some luke-warm coffee and 
soaking in the warm afternoon sun as he waited for his contacts to show. 
A white, button-down shirt, casual tan slacks and dark, sensible shoes 
did little to minimize or tame his lean, athletic frame, especially with 
the sleeves rolled up and tie loosened. Nut brown hair, trimmed short 
and faintly spiked at the top, glinted in a stray sunbeam. A square chin 
and firm, smiling mouth led up to a rather average nose, slightly 
crooked from having been broken during his more wild patrol days; 
chiseled cheekbones cradled warm hazel eyes, his intent gaze watching 
everything from beneath strong brows. If one didn&#39;t notice the gold 
shield, handcuffs and automatic tucked carefully in his belt, he would 
seem almost painfully ordinary, completely ignorable. Nothing more than 
a fellow Parisian enjoying his day.

Which, of course, was how Mirelle liked it. Andre grinned mentally, 
taking a swig of the cup in front of him. He&#39;d known Mirelle for four 
years now, and in her own way, she was as close to him as a younger 
sister. They&#39;d met when she approached him during his stint on homicide 
rotation, before he&#39;d been officially promoted. His grin widened. That 
encounter was still as fresh in his mind as the day it happened.

&quot;Andre Bridges?&quot;

Surprised, he glanced up from his coffee and the case notes he&#39;d brought 
to the caf&eacute; with him as slight, slender shadow fell over his table, the 
feminine voice speaking his name in completely unaccented French. She 
was standing beside the other chair, a vision of sleek, sun-kissed 
beauty &#150; long, thick blonde hair falling in waves down her back, creamy 
skin, a lean, lithe frame and delicate, aristocratic features. Her red, 
sleeveless top appeared to be silk or velvet, her short skirt black 
leather, and the knee-high matching boots clung to her well-muscled legs 
like second skin. A business-style leather case hung from one wrist, 
stylish sunglasses hiding her eyes. She couldn&#39;t have been more than 
fifteen.

&quot;Andre Bridges?&quot; She asked again, one elegant eyebrow rising. 
Twenty-four-year-old Andre had managed to swallow his tongue and reply. 
&quot;Yes. And you are?&quot;

&quot;Mirelle Bouquet.&quot; The girl pulled out the chair across from him and sat 
without waiting for a response, leaning the case against one metal seat 
leg as she crossed her ankles. Leaning one elbow on the table, she 
propped her chin in her hand and studied him from behind those dark 
shades. &quot;You would be the new Homicide patrolman. Second application for 
detective currently waiting for approval, already rejected once for a 
dispute with the captain over treatment of a suspect.&quot;

Andre had wondered at the time if it weren&#39;t some kind of elaborate 
joke. Where the hell had this kid gotten her information? Just who the 
hell was she? He was sure she wasn&#39;t the daughter of any of the Homicide 
Squad members; she was too polished, too professional, with an air of 
confidence and leashed potential that was almost scary in one so young. 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid you have me at a disadvantage, m&#39;am.&quot; He&#39;d narrowed his 
eyes, not staring her down, but definitely intent. &quot;You know quite a bit 
about me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my business, Monsieur.&quot; Her full lips curled up in what he would 
come to know as her trademark smirk, removing the sunglasses with a 
smooth, practiced motion as she tossed that thick hair over her 
shoulder. &quot;I am a private detective. Finding out about people is what I 
do, and I am very good at it.&quot;

&quot;I would assume you have to be.&quot; Andre had retorted before he thought. 
Her smile grew just a bit, and her eyes met his directly, frighteningly 
sharp intelligence with the wry humor in those sapphire depths. &quot;So tell 
me, Miss Bouquet. Why would you have pulled up all my information? I 
can&#39;t think of anyone who might want it. I&#39;m just a lowly public 
servant.&quot;

Folding her sunglasses, she had tucked them in the business case at her 
side, and Andre had been struck all over again with how young she had to 
be. At least, on the outside &#150; he had seen enough of the street on his 
time to know the mind behind that youthful face was obviously honed, 
quick and practical. &quot;You don&#39;t do yourself justice, sir.&quot; Her tone was 
calm, no flattery, simply stating the facts. &quot;In four years, you have an 
outstanding record, both on the streets and in more complex cases. You 
have a keen mind and a willingness to take risks in order to do your job 
well.&quot;

&quot;And that risk-taking is something you were looking for.&quot; Andre could 
see just a hint of it in her expression, and he couldn&#39;t help but think 
it was interesting. In spite of the strangeness in this whole thing, he 
was beginning to admire this girl&#39;s mix of forward manner and calculated 
secrecy. She reminded him of himself.

There was a definite hint of wry amusement in her smile now. &quot;Actually, 
yes. I&#39;ve come to you with a &#150; proposition, I suppose you might say.&quot; 
Elbow still on the table, she leaned forward slightly. &quot;I have quite a 
few contacts in various areas of society, all necessary in my line of 
work. But I am looking for a contact higher within the department 
itself.&quot;

&quot;An informant?&quot; He had made a tsk noise, surprised at his own daring. 
Something told him it was not a wise idea to antagonize this girl &#150; and 
yet, something also told him that she would tolerate his light sarcasm. 
&quot;I suppose this is the part where I ask for money in exchange for giving 
you classified information.&quot;

Mirelle laughed. &quot;Oh no. I know better than that, Monsieur Bridges. 
Everything I&#39;ve learned tells me that you are a fine officer and an 
honest man.&quot; She shook her head, reaching into the case. &quot;No, I&#39;m 
looking for something a bit closer to a confidential contact, a mutual 
exchange of information. I will make sure you have access to the 
information my other contacts provide, as well as any information I can 
find myself.&quot;

&quot;And in turn?&quot; Andre was cautious, but he couldn&#39;t help being intrigued. 
She withdrew two plain-looking file folders and set them on the table 
atop his own, a spark of definite pleased humor in her eyes. &quot;In turn, I 
want access to the resources and information of the department. Running 
licenses, tracking down addresses, warrants and the like. You will, of 
course, be free to hold back any information you don&#39;t feel comfortable 
sharing.&quot;

Opening the top folder, she tapped a photo clipped to the front, 
obviously taken in surveillance. &quot;Proof of my value as a contact. I 
believe your team has been looking for Monsieur Devereux?&quot;

Andre had gaped for a second, all professional cool forgotten. Lucius 
Devereux had been fingered in four murders and a grievous assault as 
well as nearly a dozen drug offenses. One of the victims had been the 
young mother of two small children. His entire department wanted this 
bastard&#39;s hide nailed to the wall, but no one could find him. &quot;And you 
know where he is?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all here.&quot; She agreed with a nod. &quot;It&#39;s a rather nice hotel, all 
things considered. There&#39;s also a list of the contacts within the public 
security office.&quot; Her eyes twinkled. &quot;With his capture, I would say your 
detective application is assured, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

Andre had wondered if dancing gleefully in the middle of the caf&eacute; would 
be considered impolite. Though of course &#150; &quot;I assume you came to me 
because you didn&#39;t want any of this made official.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; The girl nodded again, the hint of approval on her face showing 
that she was pleased he had grasped the situation. &quot;Few people consider 
someone as young as I am worth their attention, and fewer still would 
agree with my terms of privacy or information.&quot;

&quot;And you assume I will?&quot;

Mirelle&#39;s smirk was almost wicked now. &quot;If you were going to ignore me,&quot; 
she pointed out reasonably, &quot;you would have told me to get lost by now.&quot;

Andre grinned in spite of himself. She was right. &quot;So what&#39;s in the 
second folder?&quot; He asked.

&quot;Some work I need. My client is looking for some background information 
on a former partner of his, and his address and phone number are both 
unlisted.&quot; Standing, the girl had flipped out her sunglasses and put 
them back on, case grasped loosely in one hand. &quot;There&#39;s an unlisted 
phone number in the second file &#150; you can use it to get in contact with 
me when you have the information.&quot;

&quot;Should take about a week.&quot; Andre agreed absently, mind already focused 
on the Devereux information. Still, he could hear the cheerful sauciness 
in her voice. &quot;Good. Then I&#39;ll see you around, Monsieur Andre.&quot;

Back in the present, Andre grinned wryly. The Devereux bust had been the 
biggest in his career, and he&#39;d made detective two weeks later. He&#39;d 
also done some checking into Mirelle Bouquet, her family, and her 
client. Not that it had been easy, or complete, by any means, but it had 
been enough to pacify the worst of his suspicions, and in the end, he&#39;d 
passed on the information she&#39;d asked for. It was the beginning of a 
beautiful partnership, all things considered. She made sure he had 
information about the current ebbings of the street world, and managed 
to dig up a wide variety of &#39;dirt&#39; on any suspect he needed. He, in 
turn, passed on any tidbits he thought she might find interesting, and 
took care of discreetly running any information she needed. They met 
roughly once a month or so at various caf&eacute;s around Paris, more if one of 
them needed something specific.

Although her past was still little more than the barest details to him, 
after all the time they&#39;d worked together, he knew that he knew Mirelle 
rather well. So he&#39;d been stunned about a year ago when she&#39;d suddenly 
brought home a &#39;partner&#39; after an unexplained trip to Japan. Kirika 
Yuumura was a small, pretty girl, roughly two years younger than Mirelle 
and even more mysterious. At first, Andre hadn&#39;t known what to make of 
their apparent partnership; Mirelle acted as though she could have cared 
less about the other young woman, while Kirika was simply emotionless 
about the whole thing, following silently behind the blonde like a 
well-trained shadow. Neither of them had been willing to divulge 
anything about their connections to each other, and after the sharp 
warning glare Mirelle had given him the first time he asked, Andre had 
kept his questions to himself. But as time went on, he&#39;d also noticed 
the changes between them. Oh, they&#39;d been slight at first, so slight 
most people would never have seen it. Small moments of silent 
companionship and understanding, the flash of softness and warmth in 
Mirelle&#39;s eyes or Kirika&#39;s face, a touch of hands or arms that lingered 
for a few seconds more than strictly necessary. By the time their 
apartment had been shot up, he&#39;d been pretty much convinced there was 
more to the personal side of their relationship than even they 
suspected. And once they&#39;d returned &#150; well, by now, he wondered if their 
feelings were obvious to everyone but the two &#39;detectives&#39; themselves. 
Maybe not. Not everyone knows Mirelle like I do.

Of course, saying anything about it to their faces would be just 
slightly suicidal. Not that he believed Mirelle would hurt him without a 
good reason; but then again, he didn&#39;t necessarily believe the two of 
them were simple private detectives, either. Normal PIs weren&#39;t attacked 
at home and their apartments riddled with bullet holes because some 
client or target got disgruntled with the way they handled things. They 
certainly didn&#39;t get kidnapped &#150; Mirelle&#39;s hurried story about Kirika 
visiting her &#39;foster family&#39; aside &#150; or come home with gunshot wounds, 
knife injuries and enough bruises to give a whole new meaning to the 
term &#39;domestic abuse.&#39; As far as Andre was concerned, he believed they 
did detective work when it suited their needs, but that couldn&#39;t 
possibly be their main job. Just because he&#39;d never turned up anything 
to prove them dirty didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t, in spite of his own 
feelings to the contrary.

&quot;Thinking deep thoughts, Andre?&quot;

The teasing voice pulled him out of his reverie, and the brown-haired 
detective glanced up into Mirelle&#39;s smiling face, azure eyes sparkling 
wryly. As always, Kirika stood a step and a half behind, favoring him 
with a slight, shy smile. Andre flashed them both a wide grin, getting 
swiftly to his feet. &quot;Only reminding myself once more that your 
incredible beauty is untouchable by my mere mortal hands, lady Bouquet.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s lips twitched with laughter, although Andre caught a faint 
darkening in her amazing, coppery eyes. Jealousy, quite probably &#150; not 
that she recognized it herself. He felt a bit bad about that, although 
he knew the young woman understood it was only teasing. Mirelle favored 
him with a haughty death glare, pulling her chair back and dropping into 
it with casual elegance. Her tone was pure mockery. &quot;Now if only we 
could teach you to keep that glib tongue still.&quot;

&quot;But then how would we get his information?&quot; Kirika asked quietly, 
straight-faced as she settled beside her partner. Only the flick of her 
gaze to Andre&#39;s showed that she was teasing. He chuckled under his 
breath, dropping back into his chair now that they were both seated. 
He&#39;d always liked Kirika&#39;s rare flashes of humor. Mirelle glanced over 
and raised an eyebrow, one corner of her mouth quirking upward before 
she turned back. &quot;You called the meeting, Andre. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Andre sighed and shook his head. When Mirelle decided to shift into 
business mode, he knew better than to keep teasing. Reaching for the 
battered briefcase at his side, the detective produced a thin case file 
and dropped it on the table. &quot;Remember the Garrison case?&quot;

Mirelle nodded, eyes narrowed as she flipped open the folder. It had 
been one of their smaller cases &#150; a white-collar executive had been 
accused of embezzlement by one of his partners, and hired a hitman to 
kill his accuser. Andre had no idea how Mirelle had gotten hold of that 
information, but they&#39;d followed both money trails straight back to him, 
and he&#39;d been put away for several years. A tall, thin waiter paused 
beside their table, pad in hand, and Kirika calmly ordered tea for them 
both, though Andre knew from experience her attention didn&#39;t waver from 
the neatly-ordered sheaf of paper in front of the blonde. Not that there 
was really much to it; the standard prison inmate forms, a few witness 
statements, and a scribbled page of notes from some patrolman&#39;s report. 
&quot;Garrison&#39;s getting out in a few days, and we have a couple leads that 
suggest he might be looking for some revenge.&quot;

Mirelle snorted, an unladylike sound that somehow still suited her 
perfectly. &quot;After the ringer you people put him through, I&#39;m surprised 
he would have any clout left.&quot;

&quot;He managed to get only three years.&quot; The detective pointed out. Taking 
a sip from his coffee, he set the cup aside and leaned forward on his 
elbows. &quot;We&#39;re fairly certain he&#39;s got some assets hidden, probably in a 
Swiss or Caribbean numbered account. The search warrants didn&#39;t turn 
anything up, so we couldn&#39;t prove it, but &#150; &quot;

&quot;We all know that proving something and knowing it are two different 
things.&quot; The blonde smirked faintly, and Kirika nodded, eyes glinting 
with amusement. &quot;So you think he might be going after you?&quot;

Andre hesitated. &quot;We&#39;re not sure yet.&quot; He admitted honestly. &quot;I was more 
worried because of these reports.&quot;

Carefully, he handed over a second file, this one with pictures and more 
handwritten sheets. &quot;All of this is unofficial, but we&#39;ve had some 
surveillance done on some of his old contacts. They&#39;ve been making deals 
with some factions of an unknown criminal syndicate. The department 
hasn&#39;t been able to track down more than a few bits and pieces of intel 
on the organization. None of it&#39;s good. And they all seem like pretty 
big, bad, well-connected bastards.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re worried they might come after us.&quot; Kirika translated quietly. 
Andre&#39;s lips twisted in a frown, and he sighed, nodding. &quot;I keep you two 
off the radar as much as possible, but nothing is fool-proof. These guys 
are good enough that they might be able to put together the smallest 
pieces.&quot;

Mirelle looked darkly thoughtful, brushing back a hanging lock of thick 
gold curl with an absent hand. The detective knew she was thinking the 
same thing he had earlier; if Garrison found out they were the ones who 
tipped off the police, they would land themselves directly in his 
sights, and he definitely would not be happy.

The two young women shared a look between them Andre couldn&#39;t quite 
read. There was deep, shadowy knowledge there, the soft flickering of 
question and answer, a flash of mocking humor and the barest touch of 
gentle assurance, all shifting and rolled together. It was like a 
puzzle, smaller pieces forming a picture he wasn&#39;t privileged enough to 
see in all its dark glory. Mirelle&#39;s brows drew together, the corners of 
her lips turned downward; Kirika nodded, ever so slightly, a hint of 
softness in her face. &quot;Doing something like that, working with 
criminals, it can&#39;t be healthy.&quot; She commented quietly, as though to 
herself. &quot;Even if he doesn&#39;t get caught by the police, he might get 
himself killed.&quot;

Andre blinked, surprised by the strange moment of apparent concern for a 
merciless criminal, but Mirelle&#39;s faint, worried frown transformed into 
an amused smirk. &quot;We can always hope.&quot; The blonde agreed, an undertone 
of laughter in her voice. Those sapphire eyes flicked to Andre, and for 
just a second, the detective honestly wasn&#39;t sure if the last bit was 
meant as a joke or not. There was something frighteningly &#150; real in that 
gaze, a razor-sharp something that was both blazingly hot and icy cold. 
Whatever it was, it seemed like it could look right through him.

The sight rendered him temporarily speechless; he could only blink 
foolishly as Mirelle pushed gracefully to her feet, Kirika following a 
few seconds after. The tall, slender blonde flashed him a surprisingly 
gentle smile, patting his hand. &quot;Thanks for the warning, Andre. Take 
care of yourself too. Garrison wouldn&#39;t mind having your head on a pike, 
either.&quot;

&quot;Such a wonderful image.&quot; He managed to retort, his voice ever so 
slightly strained. Kirika&#39;s lips curled up with laughter, and Mirelle 
rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Reaching into the leather case at her 
side, she tugged out several plain folders and dropped them on the 
table. &quot;Here&#39;s a couple of the cases you asked about. Call you if we get 
some intel?&quot;

He nodded, and with a wave, the two young women strode calmly away. 
Andre watched them go, noting the confident sway of Mirelle&#39;s hips and 
the smiling glow of her profile as she turned to listen to her partner. 
And of course, the predatory grace of Kirika&#39;s strides, the way her eyes 
danced as she spoke to the gorgeous blonde at her side. Taking a deep 
breath, he sighed and shook his head. Emotionally oblivious, 
smart-assed, cocky, mysterious little idiots, the both of them.

Sometimes, he wondered just what the hell he&#39;d gotten into with those 
two.
