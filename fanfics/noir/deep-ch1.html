<h1>Deep Thoughts</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jt.html">J.T.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It had been a good morning, Kirika reflected thoughtfully as she slowly 
stirred her tea. The fact that she had missed the whole morning sleeping 
didn&#39;t seem to bother her much. After all, it was highly over-rated 
anyway. Waking up early, that is. What was there to do? Watch the 
sunrise? Been there, done that. Bored now. Make breakfast? Not if she 
wanted burnt toast and scraped off bacon bits. Last time she&#39;d tried her 
hand at cooking something more complicated than water, she&#39;d been teased 
mercilessly for the unsuccessful effort. No, she&#39;d leave all that 
domestic stuff to Mirielle whose inner Martha Stewart had reared up in 
the last few weeks.   

Watering the plants was as far as she had gone. Now that the plants had 
been shot to hell in that last gunfight, something the landlady had 
thrown a fit over, she was pretty much free and clear. The mornings were 
hers to wile away as sluggishly as she felt necessary and she couldn&#39;t 
be happier.

&#133;  

*chink*  

*chink*  

*chink*  

&#133;  

The sounds of the metal hitting porcelain were almost hypnotic and if 
Kirika didn&#39;t possess a mind like a steel trap, she would have fallen 
under its spell. As it was, she couldn&#39;t stop overanalyzing that last 
statement.   

Could she be happier?  Was she satisfied with her life right now? If she 
were happy, there would be no need asking herself these questions in the 
first place, right? So was she deluding herself, trying to steep her 
mind in domesticity like some well used tea bag when at heart, she was 
essentially nothing but a killer and would never lead a normal life?  
Did being one necessarily preclude being the other? Why did she have to 
over think everything? Couldn&#39;t she be like other teenagers and rot her 
brain the old fashioned way -- with TV?  

Her head hurt as it inevitably did whenever she thought deep thoughts 
too soon after waking up. Like always, she masked the mental gymnastics 
behind a supremely blank expression -- what Mirielle had affectionately 
termed her Zen master face.  

And speaking of Mirielle, an involuntary grin lit up her face thinking 
of her friend. She&#39;d caught herself doing that more and more often 
lately. At first, she&#39;d been horrified at the loss of facial control. 
She was a seasoned assassin, for God&#39;s sake. Smiling like a goof at the 
mere mention of her partner was unacceptable. If she was going to smile, 
it was going to be on her terms, she&#39;d stubbornly thought.  

She&#39;d clung to that little piece of control like a dying man to a life 
preserver adrift on a sea of insecurity. And, forced metaphors not 
withstanding, it had literally taken weeks of yet more deep thoughts 
before she finally raised the white flag and surrendered to the 
inevitable.  

She was in love with Mirielle Bouquet.  

She had almost fallen ass first into the commode with that particular 
revelation, coming as it did in the middle of taking a dump. God must 
have really felt particularly frisky that day to play such a cruel joke 
on her.  

If it had been up to her, that little eye-opener would have never seen 
the light of day. Two things kept that from happening:  

1)She talked in her sleep.  

2)Mirielle just happened to be an insomniac.  

Who would have thought an innocently mumbled &quot;I want to run my tongue 
all over your naked body, Mirielle&quot; would throw such large ripples 
through the koi pond of her life? And it wasn&#39;t even the only thing 
she&#39;d said in her sleep. She&#39;d apparently held a whole conversation by 
herself in those wee hours before dawn -- one which her blonde partner 
had gleefully taped. She didn&#39;t know what disconcerted her more, that 
Mirielle would tape her talking in her sleep or the evil little smile on 
her face as she&#39;d clicked the &#39;play&#39; button. Who knew Mirielle had such 
a sadistic streak in her? Killing targeted people for money was one 
thing but to take such unadulterated joy in making her squirm was 
another thing entirely.  

Mortified was too light a word for what she felt listening to herself on 
tape say things she would never ever say if she were conscious. Sure, 
she&#39;d made a few ambiguous comments here and a couple of vague gestures 
there but nothing so &#133; so .. blunt  

&quot;Yurusanai!&quot; She shouted, fighting the fierce blush on her face. &quot;I 
won&#39;t forgive you!&quot;   

It was not wise to taunt someone skilled in twelve forms of martial arts 
and possessing the ability to kill with everything from a gun to a 
spork.  

She had much more to say. Much, much more. Things that amounted to 
nothing as it turned out because, just when she was about to open her 
mouth to voice her displeasure, her lips were captured in a much more 
enjoyable activity by Mirielle&#39;s lips.  

Who would have thunk it, she thought, going back to happily stirring her 
lukewarm tea once again. And again, that irrepressible grin made another 
appearance as a sleep tousled head popped up above the divider 
separating the bedroom from the living room.  

&quot;Kirika-chan,&quot; Mirielle called with a wickedly devious grin on her own 
face. &quot;Why are you out of bed? I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot;  

A lascivious leer accompanying the playful words sent a shiver down 
Kirika&#39;s spine. Was it fear? Was it nervousness? Was it dread?  

Hell, no.  

It was pure unadulterated lust that made her fingers tingle and her 
heartbeat double time, not to mention all the delicious sensations 
happening below her waist. Mirielle wasn&#39;t helping matters either as she 
proceeded to lick her lips suggestively.  

Hmmm, I have basically two options here, Kirika thought, her mind 
already getting muddled as all blood got diverted south. Do I stay here 
with my warm tea and deep thoughts or do I jump my girlfriend and have 
hot monkey sex all afternoon? Damn, I wish every decision were that 
easy.  

Kirika needed no further prompting, overturning her chair in her 
eagerness to get back to bed which was fast becoming her favorite place 
to be in the last few weeks -- that and Mirielle&#39;s arms. </pre>
