She had a lover.

A hint of a smile on rosy lips and a slow caressing hand against her 
bared shoulder blades; light, childish laughter filled with joy, filling 
her ears while they walked down a blackened path. The moon, a pale plate 
of frosty white upon the sky, was their only guide in the impenetrable 
darkness surrounding them, shedding them a ray of light to guide their 
steps on the uneven road.

She didn&#39;t want this.

The stone pebbles cut into her bare feet as they walked. There was wind, 
a warm caressing breeze that smelled of summer and berries, soothing her 
cold skin like the warm breath of a mother, comforting her in their 
seemingly aimless wander. But despite the comfort, her body was still 
shaking; shaking in the bitter coldness against her chest that seemed to 
emanate from nowhere but her own heart.

She never wanted this.

But despite all the doubtful feelings in her heart, despite the fear 
that was threatening to take over her trembling limbs, and despite the 
pain in her bleeding feet, she walked on, guided by the warm hand 
gripping her own, trusting a love she could not see.

They walked side by side, hand in hand, together like they should always 
be; like their fates were intertwined, like their souls were merged and 
like their hearts unified in a steady, comforting rhythm. The pain 
seemed to diminish as a warm shoulder nudged her own in a playful way, 
ensuring her of the other&#39;s presence despite the fact that their eyes 
could not meet. A flicker of silky hair touched her face, letting her 
take in the brief odour of ground roses before it disappeared back into 
the shadows, swallowed again by the empty dark.

She was scared.

Their pace picked up and she soon found herself settling into a wild 
sprint, flying over the rock filled ground and through, what seemed to 
be, an eternal night. Her lover&#39;s laughter filled her ear. It was a 
sound of joy, of happiness; a cry, of heartbroken sadness; and a scream, 
of despair, of deepest, utter anguish. She tried, but could not 
comprehend the chaotic emotions in the ear shattering sound, but it 
pained her to hear her lover&#39;s suffering. It pained her so yet she could 
do nothing.

Yet they ran, as fast as their legs would carry them, steered by the 
moon towards the dark field ahead.

This was true.

Lies.

This is real.

Fabrication.

This was meant to be.

No.

Kirika woke up with a gasp, her senses snapping back to reality and 
automatically focusing on her immediate surroundings in full alarm, 
stirred by the troublesome content of her dream. Contents she was no 
longer able to remember in any detail, but troublesome they indeed had 
been. Her forehead was bathed in cold sweat, a very unnatural reaction 
for her body to have in any kind of situation, which spoke volumes about 
whatever she had forcibly been confronted with during her sleep. It must 
have been highly unpleasant for her unguarded subconscious mind.

She seldom had dreams like most of her kind. Dreams were fragments of a 
mortal&#39;s life, where the body and the mind needed to reflect and 
consider the passing day on a level where the man was not able to 
interfere and disturb. She knew that some could attain the ability of 
dream visions when they reached a certain age; those were, however, a 
blunt handful of elders who all had long since retired from the world of 
the living. Age was a burden that none living could truly escape, mortal 
or not. Memories, like the mind, became easily tired from the passing of 
eons, and from what Kirika believed, you would simply lose interest when 
you could no longer remember even the smallest fragment of your living 
life.

Not an entirely cheery thought, if she considered her own semi-amnesiac 
situation.

The first morning light had broken already and was staring her straight 
in the eyes, making it rather hard to see for even her. Irritated over 
the rather painful position she was sitting in, she tried to lift her 
hand to block out the annoying light. A screaming bell of alarm, telling 
her that something was wrong, went off like a gunshot in her head when 
she noticed that she could not move her arm; even worse, she couldn&#39;t 
move either of her hands. The immediate feeling that shot down her spine 
was not fear, however, when all her senses finally settled from the 
unpleasant dream, unifying all the impressions they sent her into a 
whole, flawless picture. She raised her eyebrows in surprise.

She was sitting with her back against some kind of wall, made out of 
steady, polished wood, the blank texture actually serving as a rather 
pleasant support to sleep against. She was looking at a certain window 
when lifting her head, though this had been rather normal since much of 
her recent occupation had consisted of doing just that. The disturbing 
thing she discovered was that this was exactly the same window belonging 
to the assassin&#39;s apartment, but from the wrong side.

She was in Mireille Bouquet&#39;s apartment, or more gravely, she had woken 
within it.

Now this would not entirely have been out of place either, since she had 
paid a few visits when the woman was sleeping. She had come to like the 
place quite a bit. Bouquet had furnished the small place in a stylish, 
but not extravagant way that spoke of a rational and practical mind. She 
did not bother with frilly details of &quot;home feelings&quot; but kept 
everything from her plants to her walls in a simple and tidy manner. She 
did not drown herself in richness and pleasantries as one would expect 
of someone who walked a road of such danger. A small but important 
aspect of her personality that raised her position in Kirika&#39;s immediate 
respect; materialism was clearly a concept that passed this woman by.

While the apartment was as clean and tidy as ever, there was one issue 
that hindered Kirika in fully enjoying her unwanted presence in the 
place.

She was unable to move her hands, or more correctly, she couldn&#39;t.

Her arms had been bent in a rather uncomfortable position behind her 
head, tied up judging by the feeling, in rough ropes that efficiently 
bent her hands out of reach from each other. It was a binding technique 
that would have left a human practically helpless towards whomever that 
was the aggressor. While not being afraid for her own safety, she could 
draw some obvious conclusion about her situation.

Bouquet knew she was here. Who else could have tied her up? The more 
curious thing was how the woman had managed to get her into this 
position with her life apparently intact. There were no signs of blood 
and struggle around the room; she could therefore, rather relieved, rule 
out the possibility that she had already fed on the woman. There was the 
possibility that the assassin had shot her again, though she could not 
recall going through such an event the previous night. There was, in 
either case, no reason for her to remain like this as her muscles were 
aching, protesting against the unnatural position they had been forced 
into.

But as she leaned forwards, straining her arms to break free from the 
ropes, she had to bite her lips hard to repress a pained scream. Hot, 
searing pain suddenly shot down her limbs in furious pulses as she tried 
to move; each of her staggering movements causing another wave of the 
torturous sensation to erupt within her like water bursting from a 
broken dam. Kirika threw her back against the wall, hitting her head 
against the wood behind with a thud as she steeled herself against the 
unknown source of torment.

Her muscles cramped, causing her to instinctually pull her limbs 
together into a crouched position. She closed her eyes to focus, trying 
to bring her mind back together to steel herself against the sudden 
shock. Resting her forehead against her knees for support, she regained 
her breath while trying to soothe the savage feeling of hot iron against 
her skin. She drew a few ragged breaths, vision going blurry for a few 
seconds while trying to calm down. Her mind worked furiously at the 
puzzle.

Not until then did she slowly notice the slight burden of an object 
hanging around her neck, resting heavily against her chest like a 
prisoner&#39;s nametag. A glimpse of silvery metal caught Kirika&#39;s eyes as 
she slowly began to recall the events of the previous night.

--

Kirika had entered the apartment around midnight, having followed the 
blonde woman&#39;s day from a safe distance as usual. Acting like a 
flickering shadow in the periphery, she had observed her every motion 
out of surprisingly childish curiosity. She hadn&#39;t been wrong about her 
choice of prey; in the passing of her ten waking years, none of her 
humans had fascinated her like this one. Kirika found herself being 
completely absorbed and almost overly studious about every detail the 
woman put into her daily routines. No notion or task seemed trivial when 
it was performed by Bouquet; even the mundane job of cleaning could 
suddenly become a task of fascination when performed by her. She watched 
the blonde move about in her apartment, picking up various items and 
taking out the trash, as if she was a regular Parisian lady instead of 
the renowned hitwoman she was. While it had been the frozen eyes of a 
natural killer that drew her, she had to admit that she slowly came to 
appreciate the &#39;normal&#39; side of the assassin even more.

Like any other woman her age, Mireille Bouquet held a rather - in 
Kirika&#39;s opinion - obsessive interest in fashion. While her sense of 
dressing resembled her way of furnishing in the manner of rationalism, 
it was by no means plain. Kirika found herself rather enjoying watching 
the blonde dressing up in one outfit after another, only giving herself 
a quick glance in the mirror before disregarding the clothes with a 
small smirk and a shake of head - to the store clerks&#39; distress. The 
clothes she chose were always resourceful and simple, yet elegant and 
striking in a way that surpassed those typical extravagantly clad women 
Kirika had seen in the Parisian streets. This blonde was not about 
temptation but intelligence. She was a sharp, well-oiled edge against 
your throat; a smile that dared you to act, and eyes - frozen pools of 
sky, aiming their unsaid challenge at whoever was courageous enough to 
meet them.

The woman was a femme fatale to the core. Men and woman alike looked up 
when she passed in her stride. Maybe unaware of it, she was truly what 
humans meant with being one in a million. Men wanted her and women 
wanted to be her; desire and envy was evident in the many passing faces. 
Mireille paid it no heed however, to Kirika&#39;s surprise. She was with no 
doubt aware of the attention but simply passed it by, making it quite 
clear through her presence and pose that she was not, and wouldn&#39;t be, 
trifled with lightly. And luckily, people got that down.

She also noticed that the assassin held a fondness for walks, especially 
to the riverbank of the Seine. More than once a day had Kirika found 
herself watching the beautiful blonde staring off into the deep coloured 
water.

While she doubted that the woman had any kind of romanticized image of 
the river&#39;s heavily polluted water, it was easy to guess that she found 
the water relaxing in a meditating way. While the nightwalker could not 
get in close enough to catch the woman&#39;s mind, she could see that 
whenever those ice blue eyes were fixed on the water, her thoughts were 
clearly drifting along the waves. It was hard to guess her thoughts 
since this woman seemed to be an ice queen, one who never showed her 
true colours beyond her doors. But by the few expressions Kirika had 
managed to catch, it was evident that whatever path the woman&#39;s mind was 
taking during those moments, it was far from happy ones.

Yesterday had been another day of shopping after a quick visit to the 
library. The darkhaired nightwalker took that this was how the assassin 
spent her days between the jobs; in a rather relaxed, if not 
vacation-like way in the streets of Paris, enjoying the bustling 
metropolis like any other young, university-aged woman would. A complete 
contrast to the experienced shadow killer that had efficiently, and 
mercifully, taken Kirika down weeks ago.

Keeping her distance from the blonde and moving around during the day, 
she had changed her attire to something more fitting for her physical 
age. She wore the same dark coloured parka but now open in the front, 
ignoring the chilly spring air since the elements couldn&#39;t harm her more 
than they would a stone. A rather plain looking, high collared sweater 
in cornflower blue with a single white stripe across the abdomen covered 
her upper part while she-after doing some studying on what the girls 
around wore- settled for a pair of light beige jeans to match it. 
Looking around and finding herself blending easily into the groups of 
high school aged youngsters, to the extent where one boy actually 
flashed her a disarming smile which she did not return, she was rather 
pleased.

After returning to the apartment, Mireille had sat down to do her daily 
catch up on the news in front of her laptop, which Kirika guessed served 
as her link to her underworld connections. She herself returned to her 
regular spot on the roof of the apartment across the street where she 
had spent the afternoon in complete silence, hiding herself in the 
shadows to observe another evening in the blonde woman&#39;s life.

The clock had been a little after one in the morning when Kirika opened 
the apartment door and soundlessly glided into the darkened hall. The 
laptop was still on the pool table, papers and documents were strewn 
around in a chaotic order. It looked like if Mireille had underlined a 
few parts among the massive amount of text, probably some preparations 
done for another job; judging by the detailed research she was doing, 
the woman planned her hits well, as expected. She could hear the 
assassin&#39;s somewhat unsteady breath behind the half-wall that separated 
the living room from her sleeping area; the rhythm was a bit off 
compared to her regular pace, probably caused by an unpleasant dream.

While she never had seen the apartment in daylight, she certainly liked 
it at night. The light fragrance of tea mixed with the pleasant, flowery 
scent of Mireille herself covered every corner of the room. It was a 
smell Kirika had found intoxicating at first, but as the days passed and 
she got used to it, became strangely soothing instead of being the 
tempting lure that could trigger her thirst by mistake.

An orchid, the sole plant in the whole apartment, was nearly in its 
blooming stage where it was placed beside the window. She could already 
smell the sweet nectar that lay hidden among its purple shaded petals; 
if only it was watered properly, the flower would with no doubt flourish 
within days. A half eaten baguette with a few leafs of lettuce lay on 
her unfinished dinner plate on the rather Spartan looking table, 
accompanied by a, now lukewarm pot of tea, and an emptied cup. Dinner 
had been a hasty business this afternoon and been made up mostly by 
whatever her fridge had offered.

Kirika was lost in her own trail of thoughts as she made a small round 
in the apartment, taking in the small differences in the interior prior 
to yesterday. Some small corner of her mind that still possessed what 
was left of her humanity sent a small twinge of awkwardness down her 
spine, making her feel like the intruder she was. She ignored it, 
however, having done this countless of times before with her earlier 
victims; though this one felt special, it would be of little matter in 
the end. The blonde woman would die, and the nightwalker intended to 
affect her life as little as possible until then.

Kirika steered her steps towards the small stairs, that led to the 
apartment&#39;s sleeping area where the blonde now lay, by the sound of her 
happily snoozing off in dreamland. The dark haired girl could see a pair 
of slender, tanned legs from where she stood. Bouquet slept in her usual 
sleeping attire consisting of a loose fitting shirt, which - in Kirika&#39;s 
opinion - looked casual but good on her. Stopping for a brief moment at 
the wall to confirm the woman&#39;s slow, now steady breath, she stepped up. 
The bad dreams must have left her as she had made her round in the 
living room.

Eager to see the beautiful woman&#39;s sleeping features, she rounded the 
wall. While the girl was fascinated and drawn by the woman&#39;s azure eyes, 
she found by no means the face of a sleeping Mireille disappointing. 
Even in her most rested and relaxed state, the woman was an impressive 
sight to behold. Not until the closure of her eyes could one fully see 
the perfection of her long, delicate looking eyelashes; nor the almost 
sacred glory her face emitted, in a state when she let all the walls and 
shields down for the onlooker to see. It was not the face of the icy, 
sharp and potentially dangerous femme fatale, but a young woman - 
vulnerable and fragile amidst the darkness of the world. It was also 
then the nightwalker realized just how young the assassin was, barely a 
few years senior her physical body, yet already so painfully burdened.

A small twinge of something had fluttered in Kirika&#39;s heart the first 
time she had seen that sleeping face. Something that stirred among the 
sea of forgotten memories that leapt back at her from their banishment 
in the abyss. A voice of laughter, a plea and the taste of tears, so 
much did she make out before the memory had crumbled again, thrown back 
after hitting whatever wall that restrained them in the first place.

It had been a strong feeling, with an almost painful edge to it; and 
sometimes, Kirika thought that she could almost recall the blurry vision 
of an unfamiliar face before her memories diminished into nothingness 
again.

It was a curious emotion, so distant and far too human for her to place.

However, Kirika was immediately jolted out from her delusions when she 
rounded the wall. What met her was not the peaceful demeanour of the 
sleeping beauty as she expected, but wide-awake sky coloured orbs, 
filled with icy anger that stared directly at her. Not through her or 
past her but at her, directly into her eyes, despite that she was hiding 
herself in the shadows. The shocking realization made Kirika&#39;s mind go 
temporarily into limbo as her senses re-adjusted with the new situation 
she suddenly had at hand. This had never, ever happened before. Taken 
pessimistically, it was quite a blow to her skills; a mortal had just - 
for lack of better terms - busted her.

A metallic clicking sound snapped her out of the shocking surprise, 
however; her feet burst into an instinctual reflex, leaping towards the 
blonde at the same time as the first bullet struck her.

The assassin was out of the bed in the second when Kirika was thrown 
back by the bullet&#39;s impact, pain dazzled her mind. Luckily, it had not 
been a bull&#39;s-eye this time, the bullet had knocked a hole in one of her 
lungs and passed through under her right shoulder blade, spraying a gush 
of her blood against the assassin&#39;s white wall. While the damage would 
not hurt her, it did slow her down for just the one tiny second which 
was all the blonde seemed to need to re-coordinate her actions. Rolling 
over the bed and landing at the other end of it, the blonde fired 
another two shots at Kirika which she dodged, throwing herself flat on 
the bed.

Taking the opportunity at hand, Mireille made a dash for the living 
room. Kirika, still confused at how the events had turned and caught off 
guard by her failure in skill, threw out an arm to hinder the blonde in 
her path. Her confusion obviously affected her usual litheness, however; 
she only managed to graze the woman&#39;s nightshirt as Mireille dodged 
skilfully out of the way, sending another bullet in a mid-jump to where 
Kirika&#39;s head had been located a second prior.

The nightwalker followed only moments after, throwing her body forwards 
from the stairs and breaking the fall into a roll as another rapid 
series of gunshots raked the floor behind her. Desiring no second bullet 
to impale her body, she took the tactical decision to continue the 
rolling motion until she felt her body hit against the dining table, 
while sensing the blonde&#39;s never failing aim ripping up thumb sized 
holes in the wood behind, showering her hair with splinters.

Kicking out against the table legs, she overturned the whole table with 
the blonde&#39;s tea and dinner onto the floor with an unceremonious crash. 
She rolled under the falling furniture just in time before the table 
board crashed down vertically behind. The cover came just in time, as 
another bullet grazed her left shoulder, making her twinge in pain. 
There, behind the temporarily safe haven from the female sharpshooter&#39;s 
bullets, Kirika managed to catch her breath and reflect on one strange, 
if not terrifying notion she had noticed in the preceding chain of 
events.

Her powers were not responding.

Something was blocking them from her reach. It had first stricken her 
when being hit by the first bullet. Mireille had actually managed to 
escape, despite the fact that she had not been holding back in her 
speed; during normal circumstances, the blonde should not even have been 
able to see her coming. Something was causing her limbs and senses to 
act sluggishly, as if heavy weights had been attached to them, making it 
impossible for her to reach the blonde in any painless way she would 
have preferred. It was ridiculous, it was laughable, but she doubted she 
would even be able to make the dash towards the pool table which served 
as the blonde&#39;s cover. And it was probably the same something that had 
revealed her from the shadows, making her detectable to the human eye.

Frustrated at the turn of events, Kirika coughed and spat out a mouthful 
of her own blood that her body had rejected from her lung. The wound was 
already healing, but was still bleeding; the burnt tissue and torn veins 
were merging, and binding together again. She could almost feel how the 
wound was closing up on her back and chest as she took another pained 
breath. She was rather lucky that the bullet had missed her spine with a 
few inches in its path. Despite possessing an immortal body, the 
nightwalkers still had their own field of healing mechanisms like the 
human body, and the spine, together with her heart and head were among 
the places she knew she would rather not be hit in.

Another few bullets slammed into the table board behind her, one of them 
finally ripping a hole through the thin wooden material, passing by 
Kirika&#39;s ear by a hair and leaving her with a whistling sound in her 
ears. It was lucky that the assassin was the sole tenant of this 
apartment complex with her closest neighbour being in the next house, or 
someone would since long have alerted the police.

It had not been her intention to fight the woman, ever. This was 
supposed to have been like her other games, the same watch and feed 
procedure she always did now and then. She never wanted to meddle in the 
woman&#39;s life or get involved in anything at all in the human world, 
especially one which she had developed a surprising fondness for over 
those recent weeks. However, the current situation left her little 
choice. The Bouquet woman would have to die, far earlier than she had 
planned to feed on her but the task&#39;s needed immediacy was final. A 
mortal could not be permitted to know about her existence.

As if reacting to her own thoughts, the dark haired girl sprung into 
action. Waiting out another round of the frenzied gunfire that was aimed 
at her, she dived out from behind the cover, intending to give the woman 
no time to re-load or recover. As expected, Mireille reacted to the 
approaching steps immediately, leaning over the table just enough to 
take aim as she prepared to fire another round. But Kirika was prepared, 
her arm lashing out, hauling one of the blonde&#39;s simple chairs with her 
in the dash. At the first sight of the woman&#39;s head bobbing up over the 
pool table&#39;s edge, she flung the chair across the room towards the 
assassin with all her might and aim while pumping her legs even harder 
to increase her speed. She only had one chance at this in her weakened 
state; Bouquet would doubtfully be able to kill her under any 
circumstances but still, being outwitted by a human was unacceptable. 
The assassin could not be underestimated.

The chair had clearly not been what the blonde had been expecting as she 
reeled back, bringing up her other arm in defence from the flying weight 
of metal and plastic that was flung at her. A soft thud of metal against 
flesh told Kirika that her aim had been true.

A small hiss of pain slipped from the blonde&#39;s lips as she struggled to 
knock the chair off her instead of diving under the table. This little 
mistake bought Kirika the milliseconds she needed. Not trusting her legs 
to carry her over the table in one leap as they usually would, she took 
support from her arms against the green, now ripped, cloth of the table 
surface in a half-somersault.

With a swift kick in midair, the chair was gone, smashed into the outer 
wall with an ear-shattering clang, barely missing the orchid where it 
stood beside the window. Kirika landed with her both knees on either 
side of the blonde woman&#39;s midsection, slamming her body down onto the 
woman with her whole weight, finally gaining the closeness she needed to 
nullify the effectiveness of the gun.

Mireille let out a gasp at the quick and unexpected body slam that 
knocked most of the air out of her lungs. However, she proved herself to 
not be so easy, as another shot ran through the night. Kirika let out a 
small cry as her left shoulder was thrown out, the bullet having ripped 
through the bones that connected her skeleton together, leaving her left 
arm temporarily useless in the struggle.

With only one arm remaining, she managed to grab the gun arm of the 
frantic woman, earning her a blow in her solar plexus while using her 
weight to hold the woman down. Things were easier said than done, 
however, as Mireille was naturally a taller woman, making the girl 
nightwalker the lighter of the two. She managed to twist, with her 
reduced and quickly draining strength, the blonde&#39;s arm to such a 
uncomfortable degree that the woman cried out in pain, finally letting 
go of the gun, which fell to the floor with a metallic, empty clatter.

Droplets of the sky met crimson-brown, entailing the both of them in a 
silent understanding.

One of them would be killed, and the next set of minutes would decide 
whom.

Kirika had wrapped the fingers of her one functional arm around 
Mireille&#39;s throat, pressing down hard to close the air passage to render 
the woman unconscious. The blonde gasped under her, kicking her legs 
upwards, shoving her knees forcefully against her back to knock Kirika 
out of balance; this while clawing her fingers against the dark haired 
girl&#39;s arm, desperately trying to get free from the deadly lock Kirika 
had on her.

A shadow of desperation passed over the blonde&#39;s features. Her 
resistance did not decline despite her hopeless situation as she reached 
up and struck Kirika over the face with her longer arms. The darkhaired 
girl was not amused and winced slightly at the slap, wishing that her 
body would hurry with the healing process to restore her arm which still 
hung haphazardly limp by her side as the pain got the better of her. A 
flicker of regret and sadness touched her in the heart at the sight of 
the beautiful blonde&#39;s panicked struggle below her. Mireille&#39;s face had 
turned a slight shade of blue due to the lack of oxygen. She whimpered 
in pain at the iron grip around her throat that was slowly, but surely, 
crushing her windpipe.

Kirika had not wanted her like this. She never liked to take her victims 
by force but preferred to use the seduction of mind to gain what she 
wanted.

Still, her blood was racing. The touch of the struggling, warm body 
under her sent her mind into white anticipation of the sweet taste that 
soon would follow. Oh the temptation of drowning in the forbidden 
pleasure the woman&#39;s bodily blood offered her, how she longed for that. 
Her instincts screamed at her to act, to feed. Now. Here. With nothing 
to lose but the life of one mere mortal, another in the long line of 
souls used to vanquish her unearthly thirst.

Kirika leaned downwards, towards the neck of the still struggling blonde 
below her. Mireille&#39;s movements were less aggressive now and lacked the 
strength to properly cause the nightwalker any problems. Her blue, so 
blue, eyes were unfocused, probably due to the strangle hold that 
effectively hindered her from breathing. Intelligent, deep orbs of 
wonder, soon to be forever still by the misdeed of her hand. Her mouth 
hung open, spluttering strangled, dry noises, leaving her face in a 
panicked expression very unlike her usual cool demeanour.

A small part of her that had still not given in to the bloodrage 
screamed at Kirika to stop, that it was still not too late to get out of 
here, out of her life, and carry on like nothing ever happened. It was, 
however, quickly overpowered by the ludicrous craving that clouded the 
darkhaired girl&#39;s mind, the bloodlust naturally blocking out all 
sensible thoughts, leaving only the raging demon that lusted after its 
sacrifice. Drawing a deep breath of air, Kirika hissed, finally 
revealing the beastly fangs that now prodded out from her upper jaw.

The assassin&#39;s eyes snapped into attention again at the sight of horror 
above her, whatever cloudiness that had dimmed her eyes now thrown to 
the winds as she doubled her efforts and strength in pushing the 
darkhaired girl away. She gritted her teeth and let out a pained, 
gurgling chain of coughs as she shot out her left hand, catching Kirika 
in the face to hinder Kirika&#39;s descend towards her neck. Her right hand 
thrashed somewhat desperately among a pile of the documents and other 
items that had crashed down from the table in their struggle, looking 
after anything that could serve as a weapon. The nightwalker paid it no 
heed, biting into the palm that Mireille pressed against her mouth. The 
warm, crimson liquid seeped into her mouth from the wound, breaking her 
last restraints and sending her senses into a fog of reddish haze by its 
sweet taste.

Mireille let out a pained and furious cry, exhausting the last mouthful 
of air she still had in her lungs and slammed her right hand into the 
girl&#39;s temple, holding on for the dear life, onto an object she clutched 
spasmodically in her fingers. Kirika managed to catch, in the haze of 
her bloodrage, a glimpse of cold silvery metal coming towards her head, 
hitting her with an impact that sent her ears ringing before the world 
around her suddenly twisted, screamed and collapsed.

The bloodlust drained out of her like sand from a pair of hands, her 
mind and sense snapping back into her like a whip, almost knocking her 
off her feet. Someone was screaming; a horrible, yet childish scream of 
dread and agony as she tried to connect what was happening. It took some 
moments before she realized that the hoarse screams of utter, desperate 
pain came from her own mouth.

White blinding light of dancing spots covered her vision as she felt how 
her limbs went slack, her muscles giving out completely as her body 
convulsed in spasms. Pulse after pulse of black, suffocating pain shook 
her whole body, shooting from her temple through every fibre and cell of 
her being. Somewhere in a distant horizon, a million light-years away, 
she felt how the blonde woman untangled herself from her crippled body, 
heaving heavily after the precious air that she needed so badly.

Her stomach churned, as she tried to stand up, her sense of balance 
completely lost in the abyss of pain that shackled through her very 
soul. She cried out again as she hit against the pool table behind her, 
clutching her functional arm around her midsection while she tried to 
suppress the agony. It didn&#39;t work. Another pulse seized through her and 
she coughed a hacking, dried out series of coughs that sounded like if 
it had come from a grave. She lurched forwards, hitting her forehead 
against the cold, wooden floor as the taste of sour, soiled blood rose 
in her throat. Before she knew it, she had thrown up at her feet, a 
bodily function she thought her immortal body was no longer capable of.

She fell, and landed on her side, unable to move as the slightest motion 
could stir another round of the hellish pain. Whimpering slightly as she 
drew a few slow, rasped breaths, Kirika tried to collect her mind again. 
Beads of sweat ran into her eyes and blurred her sight; it was as if she 
had lost all connection to her body as she lay there, breathing 
shallowly like an old man instead of the nightwalker she was. The room 
had gone silent; the only thing she could hear was her own, agonized 
breathing as she did her best to make out the rest of the room, fighting 
to regain what was left of her shaken thoughts.

The blonde woman, Mireille, was sitting against the wall, staring at her 
with horrified eyes as she clutched the gun in her hand, aiming it 
directly at Kirika&#39;s head. Her other hand was massaging the angry red 
bruise that had formed around her throat. In a strange way, Kirika was 
actually relieved that the woman was there, alive and not critically 
wounded or worse. She could not make out the woman&#39;s expression, but she 
doubted that it would be a pleasant one. A silvery, round object hung 
from her wrist, probably being the same item she had hit Kirika with in 
that last desperate attempt to break free. The object swayed back and 
forth like a pendant from the assassin&#39;s wrist. It was ticking, a 
steady, hollow sound that suddenly seemed to echo between the dark 
apartment&#39;s walls.

Kirika narrowed her eyes as her body slowly seemed to shut down, locking 
out each and one of her senses one at a time. Her sight cleared 
temporarily at the effort and she focused on the carefully crafted 
object in the other woman&#39;s hand. The unfamiliar image of two women, 
dressed in what looked like togas from ancient Greece were engraved on 
the silvery surface. Facing each other they kneeled in an almost 
painfully straight pose, both of them wielding swords, which they held 
forwards in salute, as if honouring each other&#39;s presence. Kirika 
shuddered. The room suddenly grew very, very cold, as if all the warmth 
in there suddenly avoided her while she eyed the swaying, ticking 
object.

A pocket watch.

Something warm and wet rolled down her cheek. Salty liquid leaked from 
her eyes in slow, agonized droplets; she wasn&#39;t sure of the reason, or 
the cause. It seemed ridiculous but she lay helpless to stop it as the 
room went grey. The blonde before her disappeared from her vision, 
together with the haunting image of the two women that seemed to have 
burned itself into her conscious mind.

The last thing Kirika would remember before succumbing to the pressing 
darkness was a sweet whisper of girlish laughter, a motherly voice that 
gently caressed her face, and somewhere in a distant land and time, two 
young women walking hand in hand, down a blackened road.

--

And that brought Kirika back to her present, rather miserable position. 
The images of the fight with the blonde now rested as a thin layer of 
unpleasant memories against her dizzy mind. Her wounds had healed since 
long, the muscles and body tissues in her shattered shoulder and chest 
functioned as they were supposed to; besides the stubborn stiffness in 
her bones, everything seemed to be fine. She winced as she remembered 
the severe pain of having her shoulder blown out, a first time 
experience for in her ten years and one which she had no intentions of 
trying again.

Yesterday night&#39;s unpredicted events were finally sinking in. She had 
been defeated, beaten, outplayed, and by a mortal. A mere human, indeed 
a skilled killer but still a warm-blooded woman with no skills or powers 
that even surpassed a fresh born sapling. It was ridiculous, it was 
unbelievable but she could not deny the truth. Mireille Bouquet had, by 
luck but no doubt, successfully captured her.

Her game had failed.

If it hadn&#39;t been for the heavy pain that constantly threatened to break 
through her body, it would almost have been amusing, almost.

She lowered her head and looked down, the feeling of a thin chain 
cutting into the flesh of her neck like a dull knife. Her heart sank at 
the sight, having already sensed the cold weight of metal against her 
chest. The pocket watch. The silvery surface glowed in the kiss of the 
morning light, giving the engraved picture of the both women an almost 
soft image at first glance. Kirika shivered. She did not know why or how 
but she was fairly sure, judging by her observations, that the watch was 
the object guilty of what affected, and pained her. And Bouquet had 
obviously figured out the same thing, if she didn&#39;t previously already 
know about it.

A rustle of sheets from behind, followed by soft steps down the stairs.

&quot;It&#39;s best if you don&#39;t move, if you don&#39;t want to repeat what happened 
yesterday.&quot; Kirika&#39;s eyes shot open. The voice came from her right, 
behind the wall she was sitting against. Sounds of pats of naked feet 
against the wooden floor, and she was there, in front of her.

Having followed the woman from a distance, Kirika had actually never 
experienced the full impact of being basked in the blonde woman&#39;s 
attention. Now she was, and for the umpteenth time, she had to draw a 
deep breath at the sight.

Dressed in simple blue jeans, the long, white nightshirt and her hair 
still a bit dishevelled from whatever sleep she might have been able to 
get. Mireille Bouquet loomed over the darkhaired girl, her features 
framed by the golden rays of the morning sun, with her gun in hand and 
staring down at the intruder of her house. Like an angel of death she 
cast her merciless gaze at Kirika&#39;s face, the face of a demon that had 
entered the forbidden paradise. And to the nightwalker&#39;s surprise, she 
was futile to break the eye contact. For another first time since her 
waking, she was the one at another&#39;s mercy. The whole glory of the 
impressive visual was only ruined slightly by the pale blue bruise 
around her neck, a fresh testament of the violent events that had passed 
between the both of them the previous night.

Like two sapphires cut from the morning sky, Mireille&#39;s gaze locked her 
in place. Anger, curiosity and a slight hint of dread; the questions 
that was painted in them assaulted Kirika&#39;s mind with the impact of a 
tidal wave. The sheer flow of being so close to the woman&#39;s thoughts was 
overwhelming, and just for a little scaring. No one liked to be 
assaulted and almost strangled by a stranger to near death, and Mireille 
was no exception. The gun barrel she was pointing at Kirika&#39;s head was 
not only by the means of threat, the consideration of pulling the 
trigger was constantly present in her mind, and she found it tempting. 
While Kirika was not worried for her safety, being shot in the head was 
something she preferably avoided at all cost; she would have to be 
cooperative.

Having nothing whatsoever to respond to the blonde woman&#39;s statement, 
Kirika merely feigned and controlled her facial expression to one of 
indifference, mutely looking back at the assassin to let the woman lead 
the situation.

Understanding, after a few moments of silence, that her prisoner would 
not speak, Mireille gave her a slightly annoyed frown and sat down on 
the floor in front of her, way out of kicking range.

&quot;So&quot; Her eyes could have stared down a bear. &quot;Who, and what are you?&quot; 
She cocked the gun, releasing the safety with a switch of her thumb. 
&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere until you tell me.&quot;

And to her irritation, Kirika realized that the woman was right.
