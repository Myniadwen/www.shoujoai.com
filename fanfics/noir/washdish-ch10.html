<a href="../noir/washdish-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The way the sun is in my eyes, I can tell I&#39;ve slept longer than usual. 
I lay still for a moment, re-living the night before. I get up and 
wander out into the living room, looking for Mireille. She&#39;s not at the 
computer. I turn and see her curled up on the sofa, her back to me. I&#39;m 
amazed to see her sleep so late. She looks to be in a deep sleep as I 
watch her side rise and fall with each breath. Last night must have 
really drained her. I know what it did to me....suddenly my stomach 
growls loudly and I back away from her and head into the kitchen.

----------

I&#39;ve made breakfast; not as good as she does, but for once I&#39;m the first 
one up, and I&#39;m hungry. I set the table for the both of us. It smells 
good- I didn&#39;t burn anything, not even the toast. I go back to the sofa. 
She&#39;s turned and is now facing me. I squat down so my face is even with 
hers. I notice a lump in her hair and realize she&#39;s still got that 
little seal I gave her. I try to gently disengage it but her eyes 
flutter open and she gives me a curious look.

&quot;There&#39;s... a seal in your hair.&quot;

Her eyes widen. &quot;Oh...&quot; she whispers, more to herself than me. She 
crinkles her nose and sniffs.

&quot;Did you... cook something?&quot; her voice is stronger now.

&quot;I made us breakfast.&quot; I can&#39;t help but smile proudly.

&quot;Smells good.&quot; she observes quietly. Her voice sounds a little hoarse 
today, maybe from her crying last night.

&quot;Come eat.&quot; I stand up and hold out my hand to her. She looks at my hand 
for a moment, then slowly reaches out and lets me wrap my hand around 
hers. I help pull her up and we walk over to the table together. I find 
myself wanting to skip for joy. She knows I love her- and we are still 
here. Holding hands- or at least I&#39;m holding hers. I let go of her so 
she can sit down.

&quot;Mmmm... I might need some coffee this morning.&quot; she yawns her thought 
out loud.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; I jump up. Her hand reaches out and grabs my arm.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to wait on me because... because of how you feel.&quot; her 
tone is anxious and her last words seem to take extra effort.

I look at her. She stares back at me, waiting.

&quot;Maybe I want to wait on you...because of how I feel.&quot; I say quietly. 
I&#39;m not going to deny it, not anymore.

She looks at me a moment longer, then her hand and her head drop down.

&quot;Don&#39;t go spoiling me, Kirika.&quot; she says in a tone that makes my heart 
jump funny again.

&quot;Impossible.&quot; I look down at her.

&quot;I really do have a seal stuck in my hair, don&#39;t I?&quot; she murmurs out 
loud, playing with the knot of hair on her shoulder.

I smile all the way into the kitchen. Take care of her.

&quot;I will, one day at a time.&quot;

----------

&quot;How&#39;s the ice cream?&quot; Uncle asks. He scoops out another spoonful of his 
cup and I watch the sprinkles roll down and escape onto his suit. 
Somehow, at this moment, he doesn&#39;t seem like Soldats at all. He really 
feels like an uncle.

&quot;Hrmph.&quot; I nod my head, my mouth full of crunchy cone. Due to my 
oversleeping this morning, I was almost late to meet him today. I told 
him about the events of last night and he declared that an ice cream was 
in order.

We sit in comfortable silence, finishing our treats.

&quot;You know what you were saying earlier about being not able to undo what 
has been done?&quot; he asks, wiping off his mouth with a napkin.

I nod my head, my mouth still full. He reaches inside his suit and pulls 
out his wallet. He flips through it slowly until he finds something.

&quot;We all have our moments of regret, Kirika.&quot; he says gravely, handing me 
a picture. I shove the last of the cone in my mouth and wipe my hands on 
my shorts before taking it.

My eyes widen. It&#39;s a picture of a girl who resembles me. She looks 
about the same age. The picture must be old though, I can see it&#39;s a 
little faded and worn.

&quot;That was my daughter.&quot; I hear his voice in my ear, answering the 
question for me. He straightens up and looks into the distance.

&quot;She came home and said she needed a new pair of running shoes for 
school. I told her she needed to wait till after dinner to get them.&quot;

He pauses for a moment.

&quot;She was so mad at me that she wouldn&#39;t speak to me at all during 
dinner. Not one word.&quot; I see his hand tighten around his cane.

&quot;Then she left. I never saw her again.&quot; he sighs deeply. &quot;She was killed 
in a car accident on the way home with her new shoes.&quot;

&quot;Uncle...&quot;

&quot;I still have those shoes in the box.&quot; he reaches and takes the picture 
from me.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I put my hand over his and can feel his hand holding the 
cane very tightly, as if he&#39;s holding onto that moment itself.

&quot;I can never take back that moment, Kirika, any more than you can take 
back yours. There is no atonement; only forgiveness.&quot;

&quot;Forgiveness...&quot;

His hand on the cane moves a bit, and takes mine. It feels very warm and 
strong. I give a deep sigh.

&quot;You were no more than a tool, a machine then. Machines can kill- but we 
cannot build a machine capable of courage, of forgiveness...or of love.&quot;

We sit for a moment, as I let this thought sink in.

&quot;She&#39;s already forgiven you. She came to the manor for you, Kirika.&quot;

She had come- and I&#39;d never really thought to ask her why. Was it love 
that brought her there?

&quot;But the hardest part remains. You need to forgive yourself, and she 
needs to do the same.&quot;

&quot;Mireille? Forgive herself for what?&quot; I cannot imagine Mireille feels 
guilty for the lives she&#39;s taken. It seems not to bother her at all.

He clears his throat again before speaking.

&quot;I&#39;ve watched Mireille for a long time. All her life was focused on one 
thing: training her skills so that some day she would find the one who 
killed her family, and avenge them. But the tables have turned; my, how 
they&#39;ve turned.&quot;

I stare at him. I think I know what he&#39;s going to say.

&quot;It- dishonors her family if she loves me?&quot; All of a sudden I remember 
her from last night, pushing the gun at me. You do it...you should be 
the one to do it. Send me back with my family.

&quot;Killing is the easy way out.&quot; Uncle says, looking at me as if he can 
read my thoughts. He takes his hand from mine and pulls up his sleeve, 
checking the time.

&quot;I have an appointment.&quot; he says apologetically, and groans as he 
stands. I stand with him, and he looks down at me and ruffles my hair.

&quot;I will never have another daughter.&quot; he plays with my hair for a 
moment. &quot;But I do enjoy the chance to have a niece.&quot;

&quot;Thank you...Uncle.&quot;

His hand goes down my face and he pulls my chin up.

&quot;&quot;Don&#39;t take the easy way out, Kirika.&quot;</pre>
