<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>By the way, my spell check is now online again.

How Evil of me.

	The trip to the address of their client was uneventful, perhaps 
too uneventful. It seemed that whoever had wanted them dead, had been 
pretty sure that one man would be able to do it. Either that or they had 
no idea who they were dealing with. Based on their fearsome reputation, 
the latter seemed more likely in Mireille&#39;s eyes. 

	Still it had been more than enough to shatter what peaceful calm 
they had left, what had originally been little more than an easy trip 
was now turning up to be more of the same. It was a game they had played 
well for a long time. And Mireille intended to keep on playing. 

	Of course, she had never been forced to deal with the varying 
factor. Namely; Kirika. Or at least Kirika in her current situation. 

	&quot;I have an appointment with Mr Edwin, he is expecting me.&quot; She 
told the clerk behind the desk who was staring at her avidly. Just 
another feckless youth who wanted to ogle her, Kirika growled quietly 
from Mireille&#39;s side.

	&quot;Umm, yes of course,.... Miss Bouquet?&quot; He asked nervously, his 
eyes darting to Kirika quickly. Mireille smiled as she nodded, Kirika 
did have her uses in this situation. &quot;Well, he is awaiting you, on the 
fifteenth floor, an elevator is over there.&quot; Mireille thanked him and 
with Kirika at her side walked over to the elevator, stepping inside and 
pressing the button for the fourteenth floor.

	It was an old habit. Elevators were death-traps to assassin&#39;s, and 
an ambush could be awaiting them, so they would take the stairs for the 
last floor. 

	It was a spacious elevator she had to admit. One of those round, 
glass walled things that Americans seemed so fond of, looking over New 
York. None of this Mireille of course saw, since Kirika was eyeing her. 

	She moaned inwardly, of course it had been too much to hope for 
that she might behave herself. She eyed the small Asian girl warily as 
she stared into Mireille&#39;s own eyes, making her nervous and 
uncomfortable. Mireille looked away, slightly frightened by what she saw 
there.

	Mireille heard the rustling of fabric and edged away from Kirika, 
who seemed to be almost slithering around the edges of the elevator, 
moving closer to her. The girl smiled as Mireille continued to edge away 
until they had pretty much exchanged places with each other. Mireille 
was well aware that Kirika could close the distance between them in mere 
seconds. Her breathing quickened.

	Again Kirika&#39;s eyes snared hers, the look perfectly clear as the 
girl gave a small seductive smile, the gesture so out of character that 
she might have laughed normally. 

	&quot;Who are you running away from?&quot; The girl asked easily. Mireille&#39;s 
nerves frayed and she burst out before he could think.

	&quot;Just what the hell are you doing!&quot; Kirika smiled and stopped her 
edging, the seductive look vanished too, to be replaced by one of great 
amusement. 

	&quot;Just seeing how much I can make you panic. But there&#39;s hardly 
even a challenge.&quot; She explained with a laugh. Mireille huffed angrily 
as her face went red with embarrassment, that Kirika could fluster her 
so whilst playing with her. The elevator door swished open, and not a 
moment too soon.

	They walked up the flight of stairs without any words, Kirika 
apparently alert and ready for danger whilst Mireille fumed angrily.

	By the time they were both before a glass door with the plaque 
Edwin Marcis engraved on it she was calm again. Kirika made to open the 
door but Mireille stopped her. 

	&quot;Kirika?&quot; She waited until the girl nodded in apparent confusion, 
&quot;I want you to stay out here.&quot; Easier said than done, Kirika&#39;s face went 
blank for a moment before her eyes turned steely and imploring at the 
same time. 

	&quot;But... Mireille? Why? This is about me, I need to hear it too. 
And what if it&#39;s a trap I can&#39;t protect you!! I need to be with you.&quot; 
Mireille sighed an exasperated sigh as she prepared herself to withstand 
the hurt look Kirika was giving her.

	&quot;It&#39;s a private conversation, you&#39;re still too young to have 
medical talks like this so as your guardian I go in alone.&quot;

	&quot;You just made that up!&quot; Kirika accused angrily, &quot;And besides we 
break the law at every step, and you&#39;re balking at a medical talk?! What 
is going to happen in there that you don&#39;t want me to hear?&quot; Her voice 
was getting quiet now, an angry quiet that reminded Mireille of that 
other Kirika, the one that had almost killed her. But she would NOT 
relent on this. 

	&quot;No Kirika. No. Please stay out here, for me.... Please...?&quot; 
Kirika&#39;s anger faded and her face was again hurt, almost teary. Oh God 
no, not the sympathy cell,  she moaned to herself as she looked into the 
girl&#39;s imploring eyes.

	&quot;But what if you get hurt?&quot; She whispered, Mireille tried to 
dispel the tension with some humour.

	&quot;Then I&#39;d like a funeral at sea.&quot; It was defenitely the wrong 
thing to say. A lone tear fell down the girl&#39;s cheek and she seemed to 
droop as she stood. Her shoulders falling and her mouth opening 
slightly, her breathing hitched. 

	Mireille threw her arms around her before she succumbed to tears, 
crushing her tightly to her chest and rocking her slowly.

	&quot;Shhh, I&#39;m not going to die Kirika, I&#39;m not going to leave you 
alone so don&#39;t worry. Look, the walls are glass so if you see anything 
you can shoot it before it hurts me okay?&quot; The girl nodded her head 
against Mireille&#39;s chest and seemed to melt further into her, sobbing 
slightly. Mireille continued to stroke her hair comfortingly. 

	She&#39;d never realised how much the girl depended on her, it was 
almost frightening, to have so much power over someone. The worrying 
question was; What would happen if Mireille were to die? Of a bullet or 
more natural circumstances. She had the unhappy feeling that Kirika 
would join her soon after. 

	A minute more of comforting and Kirika pulled away, her face a 
blank mask as it had been almost constantly before the drug. For a 
moment Mireille almost thought she was back to normal.

	&quot;Fine I&#39;ll wait. But I want a kiss for it.&quot; Obviously not back yet 
Mireille thought with an exasperated smile.

	&quot;A small one!&quot; Mireille countered before heading inside with a 
smile, it was cute really.

	The man behind the desk raised an eyebrow at her, indicating with 
a nod of his head the Kirika who was sitting sulkily outside, although 
she was staring through the glass at them. 

	&quot;I don&#39;t want her to know.&quot; Was all Mireille said, the man smiled.

	&quot;A kind thought.&quot; He complimented before arranging some papers on 
his desk. &quot;Well, my name is Edwin Marcis, I&#39;m the one who wrote the 
e-mails to you, though my superiors were the ones who wanted your 
services. She&#39;s the one I take it?&quot;

	&quot;Yes.&quot; Mireille affirmed without looking back at Kirika, she 
didn&#39;t want to make it too obvious what they were talking about.

	&quot;That is probably in your favour.&quot; He received a blank look, &quot;You 
see the effects of Merophoxyll should be slower on her because the drug 
will be fighting over stereotypes in her mind and natural blocks.&quot;

	&quot;English please.&quot; Mireille moaned, wondering why she used that 
phrase since she was French.

	&quot;I apologise, to put it in Layman&#39;s terms; The drug will not 
effect her so quickly as it is forcing her to be a lesbian, and the 
natural predisposition of her mind will be fighting it.&quot; That made 
sense, which also meant that the drug had a psychological effect as well 
as a physiological one. Though Mireille wondered why figuring that out 
would help her at all. 

	&quot;You see, women effected had no problems. Men are always up for, 
pardon my frankness, a good shag. And lets face it, the man in question 
was probably the one who drugged her. It had a far more negative effect 
on men however.&quot; He trailed off, his eyes shifting slightly to Kirika, 
before moving back to Mireille.

	&quot;Is she strong? Physically?&quot; Mireille found the question innocent 
enough so answered.

	&quot;Stronger than me.&quot; The man sighed.

	&quot;That&#39;s not good, you see with men, because they are naturally 
stronger, they would try and win the person over to them. But failing 
that they would rape them.&quot; Mireille&#39;s eyes widened in fear, &quot;And then 
they would force them to love them and stay with them. Prisoners in 
their own homes. Often tied to a bed and kept like a pet. Disgusting 
really.&quot; Mireille felt her eyes narrowing in anger.

	&quot;But that hardly matters now that it has been destroyed, and since 
I am here for the cure that&#39;s it right!?&quot; The man shifted nervously 
under her ferocious glare. &quot;You bastards. You&#39;re not going to give it to 
me are you?&quot;

	&quot;Now Miss Bouquet I argued against this, I really did. I do not 
want to use you, you&#39;ve been through enough, but I am a lowly official. 
Look, the high ups are arguing over a single job, I managed to make it 
just one instead of hundreds, and are trying to decide what. If you go 
back to your hotel and leave your room number here then I&#39;ll send you 
the job when they decide.&quot;

	Mireille looked at him but sensed only truth in his words, she 
sagged in the seat and let out a defeated sigh.

	&quot;And just what am I supposed to do until then? What if she tries 
to rape me?&quot; She could never imagine Kirika doing such to her, but if 
she couldn&#39;t control it, how different would it be from that other 
Kirika she so feared?

	&quot;You must pretend to be interested. She won&#39;t force you if she 
thinks she can seduce you. Play along, you&#39;re a beautiful woman I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ve had to lead many men along that you had no interest in sleeping 
with. Just take it slow and if she tries to rush things, then tell her 
you&#39;re not ready.&quot; 

	Mireille nodded. &quot;Golden chambers, penthouse. One job or we hunt 
them down and take the cure ourselves.&quot; He nodded and smiled at her as 
she departed.

	&quot;Well!?&quot; Kirika asked as they walked out of the building and into 
the busy streets.

	&quot;They have a cure that will purge you of any effects the drug 
might have had, but we have to do a job for it.&quot; Kirika snorted.

	&quot;Any effects,&quot; She mimicked, &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb, you know it&#39;s done 
something to me, and what about my kiss?&quot; Mireille blushed slightly as 
some passers by laughed to themselves.

	&quot;Later oh impatient one.&quot; Mireille laughed placing an arm around 
Kirika&#39;s shoulders and dragging her close. Kirika seemed surprised but 
after a moment hesitation melted into her side.

	This is going to be a long day. Mireille said to herself as she 
plastered a happy smile on her face.

	Well that&#39;s it. Have fun, sorry again I was so late. But my laptop 
is back in working order. Lets hope it stays that way.
