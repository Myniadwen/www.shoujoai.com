<a href="../noir/washdish-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The morning sun is too bright, and I lay still as I feel her get up out 
of bed. I blink my eyes and bring my hand up to my sore cheek. 
Everything hurts today. My eyes, from lack of sleep. My cheek, from a 
kitchen spatula. My heart, from Mireille. Mireille, who is getting 
dressed quietly in the corner of the room. I steal a glance her way, 
watching her strip off her nightshirt. She turns and looks at me, eyes 
narrowed, and I close my eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m going shopping.&quot; she announces. &quot;Then over to the range for some 
practice.&quot;

I keep my eyes closed. I can&#39;t look at her right now, it hurts.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go to the park today? It&#39;s beautiful out.&quot; she suggests 
lightly, as if nothing had ever happened.

I keep my eyes closed and nod. I want to get away from here, from her. I 
hear her slip her shoes on, then it&#39;s quiet. She gives a loud sigh.

&quot;Kirika...I&#39;m sorry I hit you.&quot;

I open my eyes, but she&#39;s gone.

----------

The park is full of people, all enjoying the day. I lay on the hill, my 
tablet forming a tent over my face. I don&#39;t feel like drawing. I keep 
seeing her from last night, how wild she looked, with her arm raised, 
suds trailing off her elbow onto the floor. How wild, and how beautiful. 
I sigh. I have no idea what to do.

&quot;Still hiding in the darkness, on such a day as this?&quot; a deep voice 
asks. I sit up in alarm, rubbing my eyes from the sudden intrusion of 
light. I squint from the sun as I try to figure out the identity of the 
speaker. It&#39;s an older gentleman, in a suit. He has a refined but 
cordial air about him, and his hair is graying.

&quot;I thought you were no longer Noir.&quot; he smiles at me. For some reason I 
don&#39;t feel threatened. I look at his elaborate cane, and suddenly 
remember him from the Manor. I can&#39;t remember his name but I know he 
belongs to Soldats.

&quot;I&#39;m not. What do you want?&quot; I am too tired to care, really. If he wants 
to kill me, fine. At least my misery will end.

&quot;Just checking in on what the former Noir is doing with her time.&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; I get up and face him. I know we&#39;ve been watched since the 
Manor, but no one has approached us. I see him frown as he looks at my 
swollen cheek.

&quot;No assignments?&quot;

I shake my head.

&quot;Then what happened to your face?&quot; he looks at me with a look that seems 
genuinely concerned.

&quot;Mireille.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; he exclaims, his head jerking in surprise. &quot;She...she hit you?&quot;

&quot;With a spatula.&quot; I sheepishly confess. That&#39;s right, the former Noir 
was taken by surprise with a spatula. Go ahead and laugh.

He snorts, then recomposes himself.

&quot;May I ask why she would attack you with a spatula?&quot;

I hang my head. Suddenly I notice that my tablet is open on the grass, 
with my sketch of Mireille, half-naked, exposed to the world. I hear his 
gentle laugh as I drop to my knees and hastily close the book.

&quot;Ah....a lovers quarrel, perhaps?&quot;

I stand back up, book under my arm. I have no idea what to say. My 
lover?

He gestures to a nearby bench. &quot;My apologies, but my knees are weak and 
won&#39;t permit me to sit on the grass. Perhaps you would care to talk over 
there?&quot; he puts his hand on my shoulder. It feels strange, to be touched 
by someone who doesn&#39;t want to hurt me. Somehow I feel calmer, and we 
walk to the bench together.</pre>
