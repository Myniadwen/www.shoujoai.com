<h1>Lost But Not Forgotten, Forgotten But Not Lost (part 10 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/zelasm.html">Oo ZelasMetallium oO</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>That was simple, Chloe thought to herself as they walked along the 
late-night streets toward their hotel. Chloe seemed not to notice the 
slew of perplexed, even frightened looks she drew from passers-by as she 
roamed the streets in a long dark cape, covered in blood she&#39;d 
accumulated ridding a few final perimeter guards of their lives, What a 
foolish boy, to betray the Soldats like that. He was sloppy, like that 
heinous attack on Kirika and her friend in Paris. Arson? What a clumsy 
assassination attempt. However, the pure fact that he had the gall to 
launch such an attack suggests he was being fed his confidence from a 
superior. I somehow doubt this will put an end to our troubles, &quot;Huh?&quot; 
Chloe turned back a bit at the tug on her cloak.

&quot;Chloe, perhaps you should go wash up,&quot; Kirika suggested plainly, having 
got the girl&#39;s attention.

She peered toward a shop window nearby, picking out her reflection and 
seeing she did indeed look a mess, covered with quickly-drying blood 
from head to toe, &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Chloe smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s go find a sink.&quot;


&quot;Honestly, Chloe, how do you do it?&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot;

&quot;Get so much blood all over you!&quot; Kirika answered plainly, watching her 
friend strip off her bloody clothing piece by piece.

The younger girl blinked, peeling off her black leather bracers, &quot;If you 
wouldn&#39;t shoot them when I&#39;m right next to them . . .&quot;

&quot;Well if you&#39;d get there quick enough you could kill them,&quot; Kirika 
responded dismissively, looking out the window onto the canals, &quot;Venice 
is nice. I wonder if the canals ever freeze over.&quot;

Chloe shot a confused look toward the girl at the window, before 
shrugging off Kirika&#39;s eccentricity as she usually did, Kirika and her 
window-side observations, Chloe sighed, pulling off her boots and 
kneepads caked with mud and blood. She pushed herself up off the bed, 
shedding her belt and chest plate and pulling her worn-out old uniform 
over her head. She glanced side-long at her idol as the teenager stood 
gazing out the window wistfully.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Chloe asked tentatively.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Kirika didn&#39;t turn from the window.

Chloe chewed her lip for a minute, before turning toward the bathroom in 
their hotel room provided by their superiors, &quot;Nothing,&quot; she sighed, 
leaving her friend to her window-side contemplation.

The torrent of lukewarm water quickly peeled the caked blood away from 
Chloe&#39;s skin, pushing the crimson water into the drain on which Chloe 
stood, watching the blood flow down as she stood idly. Her muscles 
relaxed under the warm shower of water, and she stood, taking in the 
calmness it brought her. She smiled at the puddle of blood-stained water 
that was accumulating at her feet as she stood over the drain, &quot;And the 
blood of the Soldats will seep . . .&quot; she whispered to herself 
wistfully.

&quot;What was that?&quot;

Chloe started a bit, before realizing that the voice so close to her 
ear, barely audible, wasn&#39;t a real intruder or enemy. She smiled as she 
felt Kirika wrap her arms around her waist tightly, pulling the younger 
girl back against her. Leaning into Kirika&#39;s embrace, Chloe whispered 
back, &quot;Nothing, just thinking.&quot;

Kirika grinned, taking hold of the younger girl&#39;s shoulders and pulling 
her around to face her. Not giving Chloe the chance to protest, Kirika 
pulled her into a soft kiss, one of her hands seizing Chloe&#39;s chin, 
holding her face to her own as she pressed her lips harder onto the lips 
of her partner, her tongue sneaking its way into the younger girl&#39;s open 
mouth.

Eager to deepen the kiss Chloe wrapped her arms around her idol, nudging 
her tongue past Kirika&#39;s into her love&#39;s mouth. They stood under the 
torrent of shower water, wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, neither willing 
to break the kiss and instead opting to deepen it almost forcefully. As 
Kirika finally broke the kiss to peer down at her gasping companion, she 
smiled warmly, pushing Chloe back against the plaster wall of the shower 
lightly where she pinned the girl with another kiss.

The next several minutes were a blissful blur as the two engaged in what 
had become a ritual confusion of motion between the two, each responding 
clumsily but eagerly to the other&#39;s advances and retreats, their 
breathing heavier than it would ever be on any job the preformed, Kirika 
with a look of dead concentration set on her face masking her delight, 
Chloe with her eyes squeezed shut in a sort of child-like joy. Through 
the falling water the silence was broken only by the hard and steady 
breathing of the two as they quietly worked, their hands moving as if 
they had minds of their own, finding only the most sensuous areas on 
their love.

A flurry of rigid movements from both parties as well as a soft cry from 
the younger of the two signaled the climactic end of their engagement 
and with a final dismissive kiss Kirika took her leave, leaving Chloe to 
slump down in the shower stall, exhausted and very happy.
BANG! BANG! BANG!

&quot;What on earth are you doing? Did you die or something?&quot;

Chloe nearly cried out in shock, stopping herself only by holding her 
free hand to her mouth. Wondering if she&#39;d imagined that noisy 
Corsican&#39;s demanding interruption she listened through the fall of the 
water for another knock.

&quot;It&#39;s been nearly an hour, what are you doing?!&quot; Came another knock and 
shout at the bathroom door, causing Chloe to cringe, jarring her out of 
her blissful walk down memory lane.

No matter, she&#39;d finished what she&#39;d been doing moments before. She 
quickly rinsed off once more and extracted herself from the small shower 
stall, dressing quickly and emerging with a look of absolute vexation 
etched across her features.

&quot;What took you so long,&quot; Mireille pressed, obviously in a sour mood 
after the two had spent the entire day out without her.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Chloe grumbled, hoping to hide her flushed cheeks as she sat 
on the couch in the common room of their suite. Her glance fell on 
Kirika as the girl peered out the window into the darkness. Hearing 
Mireille begin to speak again she made a quick move to change the 
subject, &quot;We will leave here in the morning. Althena will need to know 
about what&#39;s happened and will decide our actions from here.&quot;

Kirika nodded, not looking from the window, and Mireille sighed heavily, 
biting back whatever she had been about to say as she set about making 
herself a cup of coffee.

Chloe continued to peer at Kirika out of the corner of her eye as the 
girl stood silently at the window, looking out onto the street, Maybe, 
one day Kirika, you&#39;ll remember that, too. Then we&#39;ll be together again. 
You can come and live at the Manor again. Your friend can visit 
sometimes; too, we&#39;ll have tea. Oh how I wish I could tell you 
everything, make you remember faster, but I know that that would merely 
confuse you even more. It hurts so much seeing you like this, but I will 
be patient, as Althena has told me to be, and soon we will be together 
again, just like before.</pre>
