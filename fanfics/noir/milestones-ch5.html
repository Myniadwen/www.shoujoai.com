<a href="../noir/milestones-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It&#39;s so hard. It&#39;s so hard shopping for a ring for you. For all your 
classiness, you never wear jewelry, and you never told me what kind you 
like. Hmm. So what. I&#39;ll buy you a ring if it kills me. Hmm...let&#39;s 
see...no, too ornate....no, too...something....oh God is that supposed to 
be that big?!...hmm...maybe....

&quot;Miss, do you need help with something?&quot;

Huh? Oh, she works here. &quot;Hmm. I can&#39;t find what I want..?&quot;

&quot;What is it you want, miss?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; What? Really, I don&#39;t.

&quot;Then, do you know what you *don&#39;t want?&quot;

What I...don&#39;t want? &quot;Nothing too big, or...distracting...it&#39;s for 
somebody else.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. A wedding ring for the lucky fellow.&quot; She winked. Was that 
supposed to impress me?

&quot;Lucky lady.&quot;

She raised an eyebrow at me. &quot;Lady?&quot;

&quot;Yes, lady.&quot;....what?!

&quot;So, what does this lucky lady of yours like?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. She never wears jewelery or told me what she likes.&quot; 
That ring I was looking at catches my eye again; maybe you&#39;ll like it. 
&quot;What about this?&quot;

&quot;This? But it&#39;s plain; surely she won&#39;t like it...&quot;

&quot;...no, I think she will.&quot; It just...looks like something you&#39;d like. A 
plain golden ring, not big or ornate or anything, yet classy. I feel 
the money in my pocket. &quot;I&#39;ll take it.&quot;

I rush out as soon as I buy it. I can&#39;t wait to give it to you and ask 
you to marry me.



*************

&quot;Mireille, I&#39;m home.&quot;

&quot;Kirika, come here. I have something for you. Over here.&quot; You lead me 
to the pool table. What could it be? 

You reach underneath, where we keep our guns, and pull out a small box 
and open it. It&#39;s a ring, and it has a blue jewel. Blue, my favorite 
color. Does this mean...?

&quot;Kirika, will you marry me?&quot;

I...I don&#39;t know what to say. I&#39;m...so happy. I&#39;m crying. I hug you as 
tightly as I can and sob into your chest. &quot;Of course! I&#39;ll marry you 
Mireille! I&#39;ll marry you.&quot; Oh...I almost forgot. &quot;Mireille,&quot; I say 
between sobs, &quot;I got something for you, too.&quot; I clumsily hand the box to you.

Yoor face when you opened it...you do like it, don&#39;t you? &quot;Do you like 
it?&quot;

&quot;Kirika, you could&#39;ve gotten me rocks and I would like it. Were you 
planning on proposing, too?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot; I lean into your chest and close my eyes. I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m glad 
you like it, and I&#39;m glad you want to marry me. Mireille, you&#39;re the 
only one I ever want to spend the rest of my life with.</pre>
