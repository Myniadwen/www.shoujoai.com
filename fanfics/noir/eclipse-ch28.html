<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>&quot;Don&#39;t you understand now?&quot; Mireille quickly closes the bedroom door 
behind us. After Marchaud&#39;s interjection, Uncle had asked that they be 
excused. I had watched them talk for a few minutes, then Uncle declared 
he was leaving for the night.

&quot;I see it now. I see why there were only pages here and there. The whole 
thing, in its entirety- yes, that&#39;s why no one person could have it! 
That&#39;s why they had to keep it in a neutral place, like the abbey.&quot; 
Mireille paces our bedroom in excitement, clutching the letter in her 
hand. &quot;That&#39;s why they needed us to get it back from Altena. She was 
tearing them apart, splitting them apart with it. Just like Marchaud 
ripping that napkin.&quot;

I sit down on the bed, bewildered. Could all this be true?

&quot;And now Droger has it. It&#39;s not just insurance- it&#39;s the very heart of 
Soldats!&quot; her face is flushed with excitement, and her eyes glitter in a 
way that makes me uneasy.

&quot;I&#39;m going to make some calls back to Corsica. I need to see if what 
Droger wrote in the letter is the truth.&quot; She strides over to the 
dresser and yanks her phone out of her purse.

&quot;Mireille-&quot; I start, but she shakes her head impatiently at me as she 
opens the bedroom door.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot; she slams the door behind her.

&quot;But- Mireille...&quot; I sigh. &quot;If the book is the heart of Soldats- then 
what is it for Noir?&quot;



I wander back out into the living room. The door to the den is closed; I 
can hear Mireille talking inside the room. Marchaud sits impassively in 
a chair by the door. I go over to him and stand silently next to him.

&quot;You have questions for me.&quot; He doesn&#39;t bother to look at me.

&quot;I just want the truth.&quot;

&quot;The truth... died with Altena. We should leave it at that.&quot;

I sigh, and scuff my toes across the thick carpet.

&quot;But Droger...seems to know some things.&quot;

&quot;He will twist what he knows to his advantage. Beware.&quot; his reply is 
curt.

&quot;I just want to...&quot; I falter. I want to know...everything.

&quot;It is better to deal with our current situation. Chasing the ghosts of 
the past- will surely disturb those who should not be disturbed.&quot;

I decide to try one more time.

&quot;He called me...Anna.&quot;

Marchaud&#39;s head jerks around and he looks at me. His eyes narrow.

&quot;And we all know what happened to her, don&#39;t we?&quot;
