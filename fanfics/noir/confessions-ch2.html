<a href="../noir/confessions-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Kirika walked in a daze, not really paying atention to anything. She 
played that last scene in her mind, over and over again.

*Our promise is over. Get out of here, Kirika. I never want to see you 
again.*

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Mireille,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I wish I&#39;d never let it slip.&quot; 
She was so caught up in her thoughts she almost bumped into a certain 
purple-haired girl wearing a green cloak. &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Kirika mumbled as 
she narrowly missed her target.

&quot;Hey,&quot; the girl said as she grabbed Kirika&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Is something 
wrong?&quot;

Kirika looked up. &quot;Oh. It&#39;s you, Chloe.&quot;

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

Kirika looked back down. &quot;...It&#39;s Mireille. I did something... 
terrible...&quot;

Chloe raised an eyebrow.

&quot;I told her I loved her.&quot;

Chloe tried not to let her jealousy show. &quot;And?&quot;

&quot;And...she ended our promise. She never wants to see me again.&quot; Kirika&#39;s 
voice broke as she fought the urge to cry.

Once again, Chloe raised an eyebrow and tried to contain her jealousy. 
&quot;Promise?&quot;

&quot;That she would kill me when we found the truth.&quot;

Anger gripped Chloe and she squezzed Kirika&#39;s shoulders. &quot;What kind of 
&#39;friend&#39; would impose that kind of condition on you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind. Really.&quot;

&quot;Well I do. I won&#39;t stand for it. She won&#39;t be killing you if I have my 
way. Come with me.&quot; She dragged Kirika by the arm.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Kirika asked as Chloe hijacked some abandoned car.

&quot;We&#39;re going back home.&quot;

&quot;Back home?&quot;

&quot;You do want to go somewhere you&#39;re appreciated, don&#39;t you? And learn 
about your past?&quot;

&quot;...Yes.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go.&quot;

Chloe hotwired the car and took off for the Manor. &quot;Tell me, why do you 
put up with what your friend does to you?&quot;

Kirika looked down again. &quot;She&#39;s the only one...who views me as a 
person. I&#39;m just a target to everyone else. One they need dead.&quot;

&quot;I view you as a person, too. There&#39;s no excuse for her using you like 
she does. I would never do that to you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Chloe.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, once we get home, you&#39;ll find out everything, and not be 
killed afterward. And you&#39;ll be with me.&quot; Chloe couldn&#39;t help but smile 
at the thought.

Her expression grew sour as she added, &quot;And your friend? I never liked 
her, but now I hate her, for what she did to you. If I ever see her 
again I&#39;ll kill her. And she&#39;s uninvited from tea.&quot;</pre>
