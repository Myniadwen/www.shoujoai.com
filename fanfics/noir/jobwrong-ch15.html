<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;This is the place then.&quot; Mireille whispered to Kirika, making the small 
girl nod in agreement. It was indeed the building they had stood outside 
when they had first gone to see Edwin Marcis. And now they were here 
again. Though for different reasons. Kirika let her eyes scan around the 
building itself. She could see the cameras and a few alarms, but no 
security guards. They didn&#39;t expect an attack, and seemed to believe 
keeping a friendly image was more important than an image of a military 
base.

They weren&#39;t stupid then.

&quot;Most likely that they will have a guard base inside,&quot; Mireille began as 
they walked towards the building&#39;s main doors, &quot;I can see one now that&#39;s 
to operate the doors.&quot; Kirika saw him too, sitting behind a desk 
watching TV. The doors looked sturdy, and locked.

&quot;How do we get in?&quot; She asked the blonde, Mireille smiled back.

&quot;Watch and learn...&quot;

They stopped at the doors and Kirika was surprised to see Mireille knock 
on the glass to get his attention. The guard&#39;s face snapped up in shock 
as he looked to them. He then indicated to a small buzzer to their side.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; He asked, the intercom making his voice sound 
metallic and raspy. Mireille kept her eyes locked to his as she 
answered.

&quot;We were told to entertain some men at this address. I don&#39;t suppose you 
could let us in. It&#39;s dreadfully cold out here.&quot; Mireille laced her 
voice with seductive intent, forcing Kirika to hold back a shocked 
expression.

The door was open in a matter of seconds. The guard dead in a few more. 
As Kirika checked him for any useful info, Mireille ran over to his desk 
and rummaged on his computer.

&quot;Bingo.&quot; She chimed after a minute. Kirika stopped her search and calmly 
walked over to Mireille, looking over her shoulder at the screen.

&quot;Edwin has his own private quarters, on the twenty sixth floor, by the 
laboratory. Probably where they research and refine his illegal drugs. 
And look at this! Guards are situated on floors up to twenty and no 
further. If we take the elevator to twenty five, then we don&#39;t have any 
guards to worry about!&quot;

This was seeming a little too easy, even to Kirika.

&quot;But Mireille, what if it&#39;s a trap?&quot; She had to voice it, just in case 
Mireille hadn&#39;t thought of it. She didn&#39;t want Mireille to die, never 
that.

&quot;I know Kirika, I know. But this has to be done tonight, or Edwin will 
just hire someone else to kill Laura, and her family too.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, but be careful.&quot; Mireille smiled at her, making her feel funny and 
embarrassed.

&quot;I will, you be careful too Kirika. I don&#39;t want anything to happen to 
you either.&quot; Kirika nodded quickly, she felt silly, and warm. &quot;Let&#39;s go, 
Elevator to twenty five, stairs to twenty six.&quot; Kirika nodded, 
determined that this would be an end to it, an end to their troubles, an 
end to America, and an end to Edwin.

----------

The laboratory was frightening. Even to her. Pristine white walls and 
glass cabinets holding coloured vials of unknown substance. Any of which 
could be fatal. It was an assassin&#39;s worst nightmare. A single stray 
bullet could kill everyone in the area.

Kirika was sweating. As the fastest and the one with the best reactions, 
she would most likely be the one to first see a threat. So it would be 
up to her to make sure it was taken out before it could fire. And taken 
out in a single, accurate bullet. Either that, or the potential death of 
herself, her assailant, and Mireille.

It&#39;s unlikely that anyone would start such a fire fight here anyway. Not 
unless they were stupid. Which was always a valid chance in this 
business.

Something else was pressing on her nerves. This laboratory, the drugs 
being made. The reasons for them being here were beginning to click in 
place. She had been infected by that drug back in France. And Mireille 
desperately wanted the cure for it.

But the worry was: Since Mireille refused to tell her what it was, it 
must be a very deadly drug indeed. Kirika didn&#39;t want to die, not when 
she was so close to Mireille.

I don&#39;t want to die a vir-..., wait..., I didn&#39;t finish that, so I&#39;m 
going to pretend I never said it! She had to thank her Soldat induced 
training, that allowed her to retain an emotionless visage. Despite the 
deep embarrassment she really felt.

&quot;You made it quite far.&quot; A deep voice remarked, making both of them 
spin, their guns zeroing in on the voice. Before the both of them 
remembered to be careful firing and slowed down.

There was no one there, a speaker though.

&quot;Heh, I&#39;m not in that room with you. I&#39;m in the control room, and I&#39;m 
afraid it&#39;s time for this hunt to end. Quite an amusing and entertaining 
end at that. In fact, I think I will enjoy watching it.&quot;

Whilst he spoke, Kirika&#39;s eyes were racing. The Speaker was an external 
unit, wires tracing across the walls. She followed them as he nattered 
on, showing a severe lack of experience in criminal actions. That and an 
over fondness for James Bond. She was surprised he hadn&#39;t started 
discussing his master plan with them yet!

&quot;Show yourself Edwin!&quot; Mireille cried back angrily when he had finished, 
apparently not having noticed Kirika turning around as she continued to 
trace the connection. It ran through a metal corridor, with an &quot;Access 
to personnel only&quot; sign on it.

&quot;I think not. But hey! As a special gift to you, my scientists managed 
to refine Merophoxyll! Making it twice as potent, and of an immediate 
effect! Why don&#39;t you try some for me, as guinea pigs!&quot; Kirika felt her 
eyes go wide as coloured red gas seeped into the room, flowing around 
them and obscuring her vision. Assassin&#39;s instincts checked in and she 
took a quick breath of good air before holding her breath.

The red gas seemed to be heavier than air, as it floated down from where 
it was blown, before being sucked out of grates in the floor and away. 
With the speed of which it fell, the barrage couldn&#39;t last for long!

She stayed where she was, fighting the instinct to run, which was 
overpowered by the desire to stay and protect Mireille, whom she could 
hear coughing. If Mireille died... Kirika didn&#39;t know what she would do, 
just that Edwin would suffer a far worse fate. Mireille would be fine. 
She had said to Laura that Kirika was infected by the same stuff, so if 
she was infected, and had stayed healthy so long, then Mireille would 
too.

Three minutes passed, and her vision cleared as the last of the gas was 
sucked away. Another twenty seconds passed before Kirika opened her 
mouth and took deep gasps of clean air. She felt dizzy, that had been 
her limit.

&quot;Mireille?&quot; The blonde came into her vision, standing tall with a faint 
sheen of sweat on her forehead. She looked at Kirika and her eyes seemed 
glassy. But she was alive and standing, and the cure would be nearby.

&quot;Mireille, come on, I know where he is!&quot; She exclaimed before dashing 
off with her Beretta ready, towards the corridor. Edwin had 
underestimated them, and now he was going to pay the price!

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille called to her, halting her dash and making her turn 
around with a worried frown. She hoped Mireille was okay...

The Corsican Blonde was fine, walking towards her easily with no sign of 
illness.

&quot;Mireille, what is it?&quot; She asked shyly, aware of the way Mireille 
seemed to be swinging her hips as she came towards her, and the small 
smile on her perfect lips. Even possibly poisoned, Mireille looked good. 
But they had to hurry, in case Edwin got away with the cure. Kirika 
turned again.

&quot;Kirika...&quot; The voice made her turn again, a slightly bemused expression 
on her face. Mireille&#39;s voice sounded strange, as if she was caressing 
each syllable of her name seductively. Kirika felt lost.

&quot;Mireille...?&quot; She asked again, becoming aware that the blonde seemed to 
be closing in on her, but still not slowing down. Why could she not meet 
Mireille&#39;s gaze? It was as if, there was something there that made her 
look away. In embarrassment and shyness, whichever it was.

&quot;What is it Kirika?&quot; The blonde asked, making Kirika jump at the low 
voice, the voice which made her shiver. She had never heard Mireille use 
that voice before...

&quot;I... Mireille what are you ... Ahh!&quot; She squeaked as she was pressed up 
suddenly against the wall, Mireille pinning her against the cold metal 
with her own warm body. Kirika felt her muscles die, becoming as soft as 
jelly. Mireille was touching her! Pressed against her!

Mireille&#39;s hands were on her shoulders, and her body was between 
Kirika&#39;s legs, pinning her in place, since Kirika was feeling too 
muddled to stand on her own. The scent of Mireille... Oh the scent. That 
clean, herbal smell.

But what the hell was she doing? Mireille had never shown any 
inclination for this! Already Kirika could feel herself becoming 
unbearably warm, muddled by growing desire within herself. She knew 
there was something important they had to do. Something very important. 
But it just wouldn&#39;t come to her mind.

&quot;Mireille!&quot; She cried in shock once her mouth wanted to work again. She 
couldn&#39;t move. Was unsure if she wanted to move! Hands clamped on her 
cheeks, lifting her face up as Mireille closed in on her. Delicious 
intent perfectly clear...
