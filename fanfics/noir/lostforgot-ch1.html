<h1>Lost But Not Forgotten, Forgotten But Not Lost (part 1 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/zelasm.html">Oo ZelasMetallium oO</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: This is written after I watched the first 4 DVDs, so I&#39;m 
not sure of anything that happens afterwards. This is just a way I would 
like the story to play out. Also, I hope the characters aren&#39;t too OOC. 
Mireille is rather bitchy, but that&#39;ll be explained later, and Kirika&#39;s 
talkative, which will also be explained. I am unsure about how to write 
for Chloe or Althena, as they haven&#39;t been in the show much at this 
point.

----------

The manor seemed so cold and empty to Chloe. How long had it seemed like 
this? Years. Since she disappeared, the manor had been that much less of 
a home to Chloe, and more of a monument to what Chloe had lost. But what 
is lost must one day be found.

&quot;That was tougher than I thought it would be.&quot; Mireille Bouquet sighed, 
drinking the tea her partner had made for her.

&quot;He had more guards than expected.&quot; Kirika pointed out quietly something 
Mireille had already known.

&quot;Business is picking up, which is good,&quot; the blonde went on, checking 
job offers on her computer, &quot;But we&#39;re still no closer to finding the 
Soldats.&quot;

&quot;Mireille, what about that woman, Chi-&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Mireille cut her off, &quot;No.&quot; Mireille did not like the mysterious 
woman who called herself Chloe, the True Noir. Something. Something 
about her was so different, so familiar. Something wasn&#39;t right, &quot;We 
will do this alone. For all we know she is working for the Soldats.&quot;

Mireille clenched her teeth in frustration. Why didn&#39;t anything go 
smoothly anymore? This job was supposed to be easy enough, a diplomat 
whose rival for office had wished to make his odds a little more 
favorable by eliminating his opponent. Time and time again however 
Noir&#39;s prey had hired a small army of armed guards. It&#39;s almost as 
though they knew we were coming! But who would have known? A grim 
realization played across the assassin&#39;s face. Her.

Where was Kirika? The bullets continued to graze the wall near 
Mireille&#39;s head as she frantically devised a plan. The body of a 
gun-for-hire guard at her feet was still warm as she struggled to lift 
him. Gun in hand she twirled around the corner, throwing away the body 
into the line of enemy fire and emptying a clip into the four men at the 
end of the hall. The gunfire ceased and Mireille reloaded her pistol 
with a seemingly loud click. A small noise prompted her to whirl around, 
gun raised, &quot;I think,&quot; Mireille commented to the young girl behind her, 
lowering her gun,&quot; That someone&#39;s been tipping off our targets.&quot;

Kirika nodded once and whispered, &quot;The True Noir.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; The soft voice caused both assassins to turn, guns raised. What 
Mireille saw as she looked down her gun barrel prompted an unintentional 
barely audible growl.

&quot;You!&quot; Mireille half shouted, half growled, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Chloe smirked and closed her eyes, &quot;I came to warn you,&quot; opening her 
eyes she instantly took on a gravely serious demeanor, &quot;You are in grave 
danger; I am unsure as to whether or not even I could escape from your 
situation.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Mireille demanded.

&quot;The Soldats.&quot; Kirika ventured a quiet guess.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Chloe responded, &quot;The Soldats have set you in their sights, you 
are their priority one.&quot;

&quot;How do you know--&quot; Mireille began.

&quot;I can help you,&quot; Chloe smiled softly; &quot;I can take you to a place the 
Soldats would not dare to strike.&quot;

&quot;How do we know you are not working for the Soldats? You could be 
leading us into a trap.&quot; Mireille commented coldly.

&quot;I am not leading you into a trap,&quot; Chloe said quietly, &quot;You have to 
trust me. If you value your lives you will be on the noon TGV to 
Monaco.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Mireille braced her pistol as the mysterious young woman turned 
and walked away.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika murmured, &quot;somehow she knows about the Soldats and 
she knows about Noir. We should take the opportunity to speak with her.&quot;

&quot;But we can&#39;t trust her,&quot; Mireille grated her teeth.

&quot;We didn&#39;t know she was there. She&#39;s had plenty of opportunities to kill 
us but hasn&#39;t,&quot; Kirika pointed out, &quot;She&#39;s our only link to the Soldats. 
We should take advantage of this chance.&quot;

A link, Mireille thought, a link to the past. But why her? Why that 
woman? Mireille turned to her young partner to see the girl staring into 
the darkness after the woman who had deemed herself the True Noir. 
Mireille frowned, &quot;So, who is she?&quot;

Kirika turned a blank look towards Mireille, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;You sure seem adamant about going to see her. Feeling chatty this 
evening? I&#39;ve never seen you talk this much. Why do you want to see her 
so badly?&quot; Mireille demanded.

&quot;I . . . don&#39;t know.&quot; Kirika responded slowly.

&quot;We&#39;re going into a trap, I know it,&quot; Mireille grumbled as she watched 
the scenery speed by the bullet train, &quot;And what are we supposed to do 
when we get to Monaco? She never told us any directions.&quot;

&quot;Mireille, look,&quot; Kirika whispered, pointing at a public TV which was 
broadcasting the news.

&quot;. . . and in local news a fire ravaged an apartment building in central 
Paris this morning. Andre Bochardt has the story . . . Thank you, 
Christine. I&#39;m standing in central Paris and behind me is the remains of 
a building that was gutted by fire in just less than two hours. The 
owner of the building tells us that miraculously none of the residents 
were in the building at the time. The police are investigating the cause 
of the fire as well as why it spread so quickly. They are not ruling out 
arson and say there are currently no suspects. Now back to you in the 
studio, Christine . . .&quot;

&quot;M-My apartment!&quot; Mireille gasped.

&quot;I guess she was right. We probably would have been killed in that 
fire,&quot; Kirika observed, &quot;But I would not think the Soldats would be an 
organization that committed arson. It is a very dirty way to kill.&quot;

&quot;Well, she could have just told us to go to the market or somewhere! Why 
are we going to Monaco?&quot; Mireille growled. This was not her day.

&quot;The Soldats are after us,&quot; Kirika stated, &quot;And they will keep coming. 
She is taking us somewhere safe.&quot;

&quot;But why? Why is she risking the Soldats finding her just to save us? 
There must be an explanation. It must be a trap,&quot; Mireille grumbled.

&quot;Kirika Yuumura?&quot; A steward asked tentatively as he stood in the aisle, 
&quot;You have a telephone call, mademoiselle, if you would please follow me 
to the front of the car?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming too,&quot; Mireille insisted, following the steward and her 
partner. They were led into a small room the size of a bathroom stall 
where a phone lay off the hook on a small table. The steward left them 
and closed the door. Marching over to the phone Mireille jabbed the 
speaker button, &quot;Who is this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t recall calling you,&quot; Chloe&#39;s voice was soft but taunting, 
&quot;Would you open her mail, too?&quot;

&quot;Why, did you send something?&quot; Mireille retorted.

&quot;Why do you guard her so? Do you love her?&quot; Chloe shot back jeeringly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; Mireille hissed, taking 
obvious offense as she slammed the phone onto the receiver, ending the 
call, &quot;How dare she?&quot; she muttered under her breath.

The phone rang again and Kirika pressed the speaker button, &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;The Lady Luck. Room 7459. 7 PM.&quot; The phone clicked as Chloe hung up.

&quot;Well,&quot; Mireille sighed through barred teeth, calm down, &quot;At least we 
know what to do when we get there.&quot;</pre>
