It was a travel-weary Mireille who was waved indifferently through 
Customs by the bored guards at Narita International Airport, mercifully 
clearing that last security checkpoint without a fuss or a wait. The 
flight from Paris to Tokyo had neither been short nor refreshing--hours 
confined in an airplane&#39;s cabin at extreme altitudes seldom were--but it 
had at least been uneventful. The blonde assassin was grateful for that 
leniency. International air travel was frequently a required pain of 
Mireille&#39;s profession, and after so many excursions overseas and back 
she was inured to its rigors and tedium. However, that acquaintance 
didn&#39;t automatically mean her enjoyment of it had waxed at all. Rigorous 
and tedious air travel remained to her. The aftermath of a flight 
routinely imparted her with the chafing sensations of being worn-out, 
dirty, and dishevelled regardless of what she looked like in front of a 
mirror. Moreover, the longer the flight was, the more severe the 
sensations. She just didn&#39;t feel like herself once she was flying high 
in the sky, cruising at fantastic speeds above the clouds. The constant 
drone of turbine engines buzzing like a swarm of wasps in her head; the 
not-quite-right air pressure badgering her confused inner ear; the 
unsettlement in her floating stomach chasing away appetite--together 
they conspired to make her feel forever out of sorts throughout the 
flight and afterward a ragged wreck when she at last disembarked. 
Finding comfort in that environment was nigh on impossible. Even the 
myriad of opportunities for practice she&#39;d had in the course of her 
career hadn&#39;t improved those odds one bit. But at least Mireille didn&#39;t 
get airsick.

To weather the unpleasantness of the latest transcontinental flight 
raring to suck the life out of her, Mireille had attempted to do what 
she usually did--sleep through the whole dreadful ordeal, obtaining 
peace in oblivion. *Attempted*--it was tough with the collective 
aggravations of air travel rendering her ill and irritable. But she 
always tried, and tried her best. Even though the closest Mireille could 
get to actual sleep was a fitful and uneasy doze, it did seem to make 
the time pass faster. She supposed medicating herself with a sleeping 
pill might aid her in her plight, but the blonde wasn&#39;t keen to resort 
to drugs for any ailment unless absolutely called for. Mireille alleged 
that too frequent usage lowered the drug&#39;s effectiveness, thus when the 
remedy was urgently needed it wouldn&#39;t perform as well as it could. In 
the Corsican&#39;s line of work, where injury to one&#39;s person had the 
potential to manifest severely and regularly, that was an important 
factor to take into consideration. However, that being said, while 
suffering through seeming never-ending flights like the recent one from 
France to Japan Mireille did review her medication policy with a rather 
bitter attitude.

The manner in which Mireille stalked out of Customs and down the final 
stretch of empty floor to gate seventeen&#39;s exit was in conflict with the 
toll the fatigue and discomfort stacked upon her during the journey had 
exacted from her mind and body. She marched as though grim purpose 
fuelled her heavy but quick steps, one boot rapping sharply in front of 
the other and her hips rolling haughtily from side to side with each 
efficient stride. The assassin&#39;s weariness strained her visage into a 
harsh, no-nonsense scowl, her sandy eyebrows drawn down to her wrinkled 
brow and her cool blue eyes glaring, with dusky pink lips pinched 
together thinly. Those who turned their gaze in Mireille&#39;s direction 
shied it away in a hurry, her inhospitable expression surmounting the 
charm of her beautiful features.

All those except Kirika, of course. The undeterred girl in question 
walked a pace behind Mireille, tugging the blonde&#39;s trolley-like 
suitcase as she went. Evidently noticing her older partner&#39;s tiredness 
and discontent, Kirika had kindly and mutely taken charge of the 
suitcase after she had retrieved it from the baggage conveyer earlier, 
accepting the burden in addition to her own bag that was strapped across 
her body with its bulk resting on her hip. The extra encumbrance didn&#39;t 
appear to bother Kirika in any way in spite of her slender and 
diminutive stature, her gait easy and her expression diffident as usual. 
That stoic face looked as fresh as a daisy too, the stress of the plane 
travel apparently not having the same sapping affect on her as it had on 
Mireille. Not even the company of Kirika sitting in the seat next to her 
on the airplane had helped to mitigate the harassment of the trip&#39;s 
traumatic aspects on the disgruntled blonde very much.

It was a bit of a surprise that Kirika&#39;s vigour, such that it was, 
hadn&#39;t been so much as dented. In the periods when Mireille had 
temporarily abandoned her struggles to realise a decent slumber and 
instead pick at her meals, answer a call of nature, or concede defeat 
for a while and simply open her bleary eyes, she&#39;d repeatedly witnessed 
her young partner wide awake and upright in her chair, idling away the 
hours in the air by staring out the window alongside her. Mireille had 
the suspicion that Kirika hadn&#39;t caught a single wink of sleep 
throughout the entire flight, and quite likely had actually forgone any 
attempt to catch some outright.

Mireille hadn&#39;t probed the quiet girl on her suspected self-deprivation, 
believing its basis lied in her eccentricities... or was attributable to 
their boarding of their Soldats-sponsored flight to Japan in the first 
place. The former Mireille could simply accept as characteristic Kirika 
oddness; peculiar behaviour warranting no more than an indulgent smile 
and wry shake of her head; but if the latter had been the truth then a 
stilled tongue and blind eye was the significantly less amused order of 
the day. Kirika&#39;s solemn countenance did look heavier with gloom than 
was normal for her, the demons that plagued her mind and the ghosts that 
haunted her heart appearing to distance her further from the world 
around her, the tortured girl&#39;s permanent state of distraction more 
obvious. It was liable that at least one of those distractions owed its 
origins to her and Mireille&#39;s decision to play Breffort&#39;s game and 
comply with his &#39;counsel&#39; advising they come submerge themselves in the 
bloody feud between Kaede Ishinomori and Soldats. Indeed, Kirika&#39;s 
heightened despondency and preoccupation had initially been exhibited on 
that last morning in their Parisian apartment, just as they were 
preparing to embark on the odious excursion. Mireille was fully aware 
that it was difficult for a troubled mind to attain solace in slumber. 
Even if sleep did embrace you in its lulling arms, sometimes the 
darkness in the world of the waking that you were trying to escape from 
followed you.

Whichever the reason for Kirika&#39;s shunning of sleep on the airplane, it 
meant Mireille had stayed a silent observer to her partner&#39;s actions, or 
lack thereof as was the case. The averse decision to depart their safe 
and serene home--safe and serene for the short term at any rate, if 
Breffort&#39;s warnings were to be trusted--for the urban battleground in 
the Far East and wade into a bitter conflict that was not theirs, the 
manipulative impelling of their Soldats patron pushing them towards the 
fray, wasn&#39;t a choice topic of conversation for Mireille, and no doubt 
for Kirika either. Hence the blonde steered clear of it, opting for 
silence over speech when she deemed it necessary, and not daring to even 
bring up subjects that dwelled too near to that taboo area. The two 
young women didn&#39;t need to be reminded of what had been undertaken and 
what consequences of that undertaking lay ahead. They knew. They knew 
the darkness that awaited them. The path Mireille and Kirika had elected 
to take was black; a familiar path to them both, one they had well 
travelled. The decision had been made. There was no going back now; 
there very seldom was on that cruel and ruthless road. All there was to 
do was follow through on their choice, their path. To wherever it may 
lead.

And so far that choice had brought Mireille and Kirika to the exit of 
gate seventeen in Narita Airport, Tokyo, and to the conclusion of their 
journey to Japan; a sight for the older of the duo&#39;s sore eyes.

Mireille issued a soft, thankful breath as she passed through the gate 
and into the bustling airport&#39;s lobby, as though she had finally made it 
across the finish line after an agonising marathon. The tension knotting 
her shoulders ebbed with the relief, although not by much. The only 
tried and true remedy to loosen those stiff muscles and soothe the rest 
of air travel&#39;s aches was a nice, long, relaxing soak under the 
massaging jets of a hot and steamy shower. But at least the worst of the 
trip was over, and that shower was merely a swift bullet train ride 
away, waiting for Mireille in Yokohama and the first luxurious hotel she 
laid eyes on.

The lobby of Narita Airport was like any other international 
airport&#39;s--astir with life, a flurry of activity. Travellers came and 
went; boarding planes or disembarking from them; and their family, 
friends, colleagues, or whoever was there to see them off on their 
departure or greet them on their arrival made up the secondary 
population. It was a gateway to the rest of the world, or the final 
destination for the homeward bound. It shouldn&#39;t have been distinct from 
any other foreign airport Mireille had visited, one of many in an 
exhaustive and far-flung list. But it was. And not just for her alone.

Mireille&#39;s brisk trot petered out to a daydreaming dawdle, the chaotic 
currents of the heaving crowds swirling unnoticed around her. The last 
occasion she was here, Japanese soil beneath her feet for the first time 
in years, it had been the beginning step of an odyssey that would beget 
a wave of change to gradually wash though her life. A revolution and a 
revelation, a languishing life enriched and a traumatic past put to 
rest. Back then Mireille&#39;s feelings had been dubious about coming to 
Japan, cautious about answering a mysterious summons from a mysterious 
girl in a distant country. How a melody from her memory had come to be 
so far from her former home in Corsica and in the hands of a young 
Japanese girl who apparently knew her identity and the profession it was 
linked to had inspired the blonde assassin&#39;s wariness, but her need to 
pursue the slim clue to the true happenings in her past after such a 
long dearth of them had been motivation enough. The consequences of that 
decision Mireille could have never predicted... nor could her wildest 
dreams have ever conjured any better. She hoped that this second 
decision to come to Japan proved to be as shrewd as the first. If it 
would prove to be as fruitful....

Mireille&#39;s dawdle halted mid-step, and the blonde looked back over her 
shoulder to the girl tagging along docilely after her. Kirika stopped 
too and blinked up at her, soulful eyes searching the woman&#39;s own fond 
blue inquisitively for the reason behind the delay. Mireille smiled with 
a tenderness to match that shining in her gaze. There was no chance this 
trip to Japan would turn out to be as rewarding. What Mireille had 
returned with from that previous visit was a &#39;souvenir&#39; beyond 
compare--Kirika, the young Japanese girl who had lured her overseas to 
begin with. Kirika had been the catalyst if not the very cause of all 
the wonderful changes in Mireille&#39;s life... and those in the woman 
herself. It was Kirika who had brought about the revolution and 
revelation both, and many of each. It was Kirika who had shown her what 
was missing in her life, that it could be so much more, that it had the 
capacity for such joy although amid darkness and death. And then it was 
Kirika who had provided that what was missing. Kirika had taught 
Mireille the pain of loneliness, and then she had taught her the warmth 
of companionship. It was she who had awakened feelings inside of 
Mireille that the assassin had never believed were there, feelings that 
she had never thought she would experience for herself, feelings she 
never considered she would grow to need and adore.

It was Kirika also who had helped Mireille live with her anguished past, 
to move on from it... to let go. While the yen for vengeance remained a 
ready passion in Mireille, Kirika had shown her that forgiveness could 
be just as strong. And just as right. Kirika had killed her family. Tool 
of Altena&#39;s or not, deep down Mireille knew that was the raw truth. She 
could make excuses for the girl and justify each one faultlessly, as 
many as she liked, excuse upon excuse to defend her partner&#39;s actions. 
But ultimately Kirika had pulled the trigger; Kirika had ended their 
lives. Mireille knew that, even though she didn&#39;t like to see it that 
way.

Yet it didn&#39;t matter. The feelings Kirika had evoked inside Mireille 
still persisted, and were still entirely focused on the girl who had 
nurtured them to the surface. Mireille had forgiven her. Forgiven what 
should not have been forgiven. The blonde wondered where she would be 
without that lesson. She would likely have exacted retribution on Altena 
when she&#39;d had the opportunity, killed her, and then... and then who 
knows? Perhaps her craving for revenge would have engulfed her senses 
and her heart, incited by one act of vengeance to do another, and she&#39;d 
have then turned her gun on Kirika next; the tender, novel, feelings of 
affection giving way to the old, bitter, familiar feelings of malice. 
That was, if she hadn&#39;t already shot Kirika back in that graveyard. 
Suffice to say everything would be different. One thing Mireille knew 
for sure however was that she would be but a husk of the woman she was 
now, unwittingly having doomed herself to a loveless, lonely existence, 
and forever cursing her rash act, her horrendous mistake--trapped in her 
own personal purgatory. Mireille owed Kirika a great deal more than the 
quiet girl probably was aware of. But all Kirika asked for in return was 
her love. It was such a small recompense, freely given. Gladly given.

Mireille&#39;s expression softened as her thoughts did, what little remained 
of the hard ice in her gaze thawing in the mounting warmth that 
progressively pervaded it, the image of Kirika reflected in the bright, 
shimmering blue. Her aches and fatigue grew fainter, her body&#39;s 
grumbling distant, melting away with the cool assassin and leaving just 
the woman. A woman in love. Perhaps Mireille had discovered another cure 
for the pains of air travel.

One corner of Mireille&#39;s mouth curled higher, her smile a wry smirk now, 
and she shook her head gently. She certainly seemed to be a changed 
person. Forgiveness over vengeance, love over hate, and not to mention 
her frequent smitten musings. The blonde reminded herself to be careful. 
A soft heart, a warm heart, was very vulnerable, an easy target. It did 
not have the safeguards that a hard, cold heart afforded.

But right now Mireille saw no danger in indulging in a little 
sentimentality. She spun around smoothly to face Kirika proper, a hand 
going to the curve of a raised hip and a teasing, humorous remark on her 
lips; it about to be unleashed upon the prime target: her unsuspecting 
petite partner. However, she abruptly gave pause, bemused eyes looking 
to her left and right at the milling people everywhere and her parted 
lips drawing closed again, her tease dying on her tongue and then 
forgotten. It hadn&#39;t dawned on her before, the voices all around her 
being heard yet not truly being perceived, but the language she had 
become accustomed to sharing virtually only with Kirika wasn&#39;t so unique 
here. A tide of distinctive chatter washed over Mireille, an ocean 
around her, she and Kirika no longer alone in their fluency of the 
Japanese language but immersed in a sea of proficients; exclusive now 
common. It was like their private world for two was suddenly being 
encroached by countless, everybody somehow coming to understand the 
&#39;secret&#39; tongue they conversed with. Mireille didn&#39;t like it. The sense 
of intrusion, of being beset by interlopers from all sides; the feeling 
of something special lost. She debated whether she and Kirika should 
talk to one another in French instead, at least whilst in a nation where 
Japanese was the native tongue.

Mireille contemplated whether Kirika was suffering a similar sense of 
trespass, or if the girl possessed a lesser level of import in how they 
communicated than she did. The woman wondered how her partner felt about 
being back in Japan--apt to be her country of birth--in the first place. 
Obviously the decision to come didn&#39;t sit comfortably with her, but did 
the reasons for that anxiety also include her return to the land where 
she used to live before partnering with Mireille?

Mireille didn&#39;t know much about Kirika&#39;s life in Japan before their 
meeting. She had never even thought to pry into those details before 
now, and Kirika, being Kirika, hadn&#39;t volunteered much more information 
than what she had recounted in her house following their brush with 
Soldats&#39; hitmen. She had attended high school here--in Kawasaki to be 
exact, a city that they would be passing through on their route to 
Yokohama--Mireille at least was privy to. Maybe Kirika had friends in 
Japan? It was a slim possibility, bearing in mind how introverted Kirika 
was, but there could be people who knew her, or recognised her at any 
rate. Mireille imagined she&#39;d find it odd if some past acquaintance of 
her partner&#39;s singled out Kirika from a crowd and sparked up a 
conversation with the girl. She was used to Kirika being the eternal 
stranger wherever they went, an enigma to everyone except her. 
Conversely, here in Japan Kirika was surrounded by her own people, 
walked in her own land, and Mireille was the obvious outsider. Here 
Mireille stood out like wheat mixed with olives, her Caucasian looks and 
natural blonde locks a scarcity, whereas Kirika, who had stood out 
somewhat in Paris, blended in, at least in the outward sense. But 
somehow Mireille didn&#39;t think that match of appearances made Kirika feel 
any more belonging than she did.

However Kirika&#39;s days in Japan had been like, Mireille didn&#39;t get the 
impression that it had been the most fulfilling existence. Loneliness 
was an affliction Mireille had not held sole claim to, nor was hers the 
only that had been cured when she and Kirika had united in business, 
life, and love.

Before Mireille could recover her slightly shaken poise or her mislaid 
teasing comment, her wandering gaze was coerced into centring on Kirika 
again as the girl leaned coolly out to her left, peeking past the blonde 
at something behind her. Mireille promptly turned around to see what had 
captured her partner&#39;s interest, her right hand stealing instinctively 
inside her grey coat for the reassuring chill of gun metal against her 
fingertips... until she recalled that her Walther P99 resided in her 
laptop bag, secreted away from airport security.

&quot;Bang!&quot;

Mireille&#39;s heart jumped in her chest and her muscles jerked impulsively, 
her turn met by a pistol aimed at her chest, the lack of her own 
weapon&#39;s availability acute. Then she realised that the &#39;pistol&#39;s&#39; 
barrel was nothing more than a harmless pointing finger. Immediately 
Mireille&#39;s already sour mood curdled to a greater degree of tartness. 
Although her startled jolt was all but imperceptible to the naked eye, 
the fact that she had reacted so to a mere pantomime of a firearm was 
grating in its humiliation. Moreover, the voice that had sounded for the 
pretend pistol&#39;s discharge was very French, the accent and the language 
itself sounding oddly isolated in the midst of so much Japanese 
vernacular. It educed a sliver of nostalgia in the Corsican assassin as 
well, it something comfortingly familiar in an unfamiliar land; 
something of the home Mireille wished she and Kirika hadn&#39;t needed to 
abscond. It seemed a little part of the world Mireille and Kirika had 
left behind lingered still. Or rather, had come along with them. It 
wasn&#39;t the joking French tongue that additionally stoked the blonde&#39;s 
temper, but just who it belonged to. What he belonged to. Not all that 
had lingered was good.

&quot;You,&quot; Mireille stated frigidly in corresponding French, the gentleness 
that had been in her eyes for Kirika expelled and the hard ice restored 
for the Soldats operative who had materialised.

&quot;Me.&quot; The man Mireille recognised as Jacques, Breffort&#39;s one-time 
messenger, winked and cracked a smile that&#39;s edginess and unsteadiness 
caused it to border on a sleazy leer, and then blew make-believe smoke 
from the end of his literal &#39;hand&#39; gun--that end being the top of his 
pointed finger. Like the previous time the blonde assassin had 
encountered him--in the deceased crime boss Richard Millet&#39;s likewise 
finished stripclub headquarters, &#39;Slick Chicks&#39;, in Paris&#39; Pigalle; the 
club having met no better fate than its former owner--Jacques was 
dressed in the characteristic attire of a Soldats lackey; in a suit, 
shirt, and tie, except dark navy prevalent instead of black. His 
trademark black sunglasses were on display too, their old-fashioned 
large square frames seeming to cover much of his face like a 
stereotypical bandit&#39;s mask, the illusion on account of their bulk.

Mireille wondered what Jacques was doing so far from France, and in 
Japan of all remote places. It was too convenient a meeting to be 
coincidence, reminiscent of their last encounter. Like that last one it 
was without a doubt Breffort&#39;s machinations that were responsible for 
steering their paths into crossing. There was no such thing as 
coincidence with Soldats, Mireille reminisced.

Jacques gaily pushed himself off the wall he was resting his back 
against and closed the short gap between him and the pair of assassins. 
A black briefcase swung at his left side, its presence somewhat 
conspicuous. He would not have brought it to this unscheduled--from 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s standpoint at any rate--meeting if it served no 
importance.

&quot;Heh, I guess that&#39;s a dangerous thing to do around your type,&quot; Jacques 
remarked with meek wit as he approached. His slightly nervous half-grin 
grew in what Mireille assumed was contrition, becoming as rueful as his 
voice. It was a poor endeavour at apology, one Mireille favoured with no 
more than a dry, callous, and naturally unforgiving glower. She was 
conscious that she was being overly scornful due to how worn out and 
unkempt she was feeling, and that put together with Jacques&#39; known ties 
to Soldats and the general state of affairs her and her partner were 
unjustly ensnared in translated to cold ire and acerbic bile for the 
misfortunate Frenchman. Not that Mireille cared at all. Any agent of 
Soldats was deserving of her contempt for the many atrocities and 
cruelties their nefarious organisation had perpetrated in her and 
Kirika&#39;s lives. Were still perpetrating.

&quot;We weren&#39;t formally introduced before,&quot; Jacques said as soon as he came 
to a stop in front of Mireille and Kirika. He slouched where he stood in 
a transparent charade of laid-back repose, making an obvious exertion to 
slacken his tense muscles and keep them slack. Slight agitation wobbled 
through his voice on top of that, and his brown bangs were starting to 
adhere to his forehead with escalating perspiration--and it was barely 
above ten degrees Celsius outside if the pilot&#39;s information on the 
flight over here had been accurate, and not much warmer inside the 
airport&#39;s lobby. Jacque didn&#39;t appear to be faring well in the face of 
Mireille&#39;s obvious disdain. &quot;Out last meeting wasn&#39;t exactly in ideal 
circumstances,&quot; he commented wryly.

Jacques stuck out his right hand stiffly at Mireille to shake, the woman 
noting its clammy palm and timorous quivering in her derisive cursory 
glance down at it. &quot;You can call me Jacques. Jacques Rousseau.&quot;

&quot;Is that your real name, &#39;Jacques&#39;?&quot; Mireille inquired deprecatingly, 
spurning his proffered handshake by not making even the faintest twitch 
of her own hand towards his. She didn&#39;t feel the need or the want to 
introduce herself or her partner in return, either. She was positive 
that Jacques was abundantly versed in her name and background, and 
likely in Kirika&#39;s as well.

&quot;It is right now,&quot; Jacques retorted rather slickly, his now full and 
cavalier smile just as slick. But quickly the anxious agent returned as 
the Frenchman took his rejected hand back and wiped its sliminess off on 
a pant leg, trying to be discreet in his motion but failing miserably. 
&quot;I&#39;m your contact here in the Japan,&quot; Jacques went on. &quot;He thought a 
face you recognised would be best.&quot; That unnamed &#39;he&#39; had to Breffort, 
Mireille deduced. &quot;My prior position had recently become redundant 
anyway,&quot; the Soldats operative added with a bit of a weak chuckle, one 
that cut off hastily when he saw that his audience weren&#39;t sharing in 
it. &quot;Uh, I only speak a little Japanese though, so I would appreciate it 
if we just stick to familiar French between us,&quot; Jacques stumbled out, 
his gaze flicking to Kirika--who was watching him with her usual deadpan 
expression--for an instant. He reached up and scratched behind his 
awkwardly bowing head, and drew out a weary sigh. &quot;It&#39;s going to be 
tough here with the language barrier. I know it,&quot; he bemoaned to 
himself.

Mireille&#39;s frown tightened and her expression chilled to an even colder 
veneer, her complexion that was pallid with tiredness bringing out the 
vivid winter&#39;s frost crystallised in her eyes. For Jacques to have 
arrived in Tokyo ahead of her and Kirika he would have been rushed 
indeed, given the narrow timeframe between the assassins&#39; grudging 
acceptance of Breffort&#39;s proposal and their own arrival in the Far 
Eastern capitol. The more plausible scenario, the one Mireille judged as 
truth, was that Breffort had dispatched his minion *before* she and 
Kirika had succumbed to his scheming. It would be like him to do such a 
thing--the typical arrogance of Soldats.

And that impudent presumption galled Mireille. Galled her considerably. 
It didn&#39;t matter if her belief was incorrect; like the rest of Soldats, 
Breffort had more than earned her loathing already without that 
supplement. The further she reflected upon how he had orchestrated it so 
that her and Kirika&#39;s peaceful, quiet existence was no longer thus; how 
he had manoeuvred them into deserting their home and travel to the other 
side of the world to participate in suppressing the little rebellion 
he--*Soldats*--had on his hands; the more the Corsican fumed silently 
but furiously inside. Regardless if Breffort had simply been 
enterprising and used circumstances in Paris to serve his cause it 
changed nothing. The outcomes had been the same; the wrong done to 
Mireille and the girl she profoundly treasured the same. To wrong 
Mireille risked death, but to wrong she who had her love promised it. 
Kirika had been as happy as Mireille had ever seen her before that car 
bomb had propelled them into this mess; had seemed content with her calm 
and relaxed days spent alongside the woman. But that life had been 
spoiled now. Cut short by Soldats intrigue and their petty internal 
squabbling. The penalty Breffort would pay for his part in this would be 
dire. Mireille swore it. She could do nothing to fulfil her revenge 
fantasies and cool her boiling blood presently... but the moment would 
come. Breffort could only cower behind his position in Soldats for so 
long before Mireille&#39;s hunger for retribution burned so hot that it 
blazed beyond his then flimsy shield. Hell hath no fury like a woman 
scorned... and a scorned woman in love? Her wrath could make the heavens 
quake.

Mireille uncomfortably rolled her right shoulder and adjusted the strap 
of her laptop&#39;s carry bag there for the umpteenth time since getting off 
the plane, the strap digging sorely into the muscles near her neck--one 
of numerous dull and dourly endured aches that made her entire body 
groan for that relieving shower. Jacques&#39; company seemed to kindle the 
twinges and throbs to assault her all the more, as did thoughts on 
Breffort and Soldats. To say that Mireille was grumpy was a severe 
understatement.

Jacques, witnessing her discomfort, advanced an extra pace towards 
Mireille, his free hand rising to reach for her bag. &quot;Here, let me help 
you with some of those,&quot; he politely suggested.

Mireille retreated an according step from Jacques and gripped the strap 
of her shoulder bag firmly, angling her right shoulder and the luggage 
with it away from his volunteered hand in a dissuading show. &quot;That won&#39;t 
be necessary,&quot; the blonde rebuffed in a voice as hospitable as a 
tempestuous artic blizzard.

&quot;No, no; it&#39;s alright, I insist,&quot; Jacques persevered, not taking the 
hint from Mireille&#39;s unreceptive tone. He turned to Kirika and bent down 
to the shorter girl&#39;s level, a ticing smile on his face that he probably 
believed looked encouraging. It was closer to a smile one produced while 
terribly constipated. The Soldats agent gingerly gestured towards 
Mireille&#39;s suitcase that Kirika had propped upright next to her, one of 
the young yet unrivalled assassin&#39;s deceptively frail-looking hands 
drooped over the extended handle.

The nimble and delicate fingers of that hand curled closed little by 
little around the suitcase&#39;s handle whilst their diminutive owner 
blinked a couple of times in bewilderment at her shadowy reflection 
stretched over the curved lenses of Jacques sunglasses. Kirika turned 
her head to Mireille, the uncertainty in her eyes soliciting guidance 
from her elder.

But such guidance wasn&#39;t needed, or rather was already given as Mireille 
sidestepped in front of her unsure partner, her body a blockade to keep 
Kirika and Jacques&#39; unwanted services apart. &quot;So do I,&quot; the Corsican 
said with a look as grim as her voice, her gaze of piercing blue 
stabbing through the man&#39;s dark sunglasses to the orbs behind.

Mireille&#39;s daunting gaze must have penetrated deeper into Jacques&#39; brain 
also, because he quickly gave ground before the imposing feminine wall, 
the Soldats agent&#39;s shoes scuffing and squeaking across the floor in his 
haste. He bobbed his head several times in acknowledgement, motions more 
akin to a fearful twitching. His right hand, trembling like a junkie in 
a desperate need of a fix, withdrew a cigarette from his jacket&#39;s breast 
pocket to be held between his shaky fingers and lifted to his mouth. The 
cigarette&#39;s appearance lasted for but a moment however before he 
suddenly grasped where he was; standing in an airport lobby where 
smoking was not permitted; and it vanished inside his pocket once again.

&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Mireille demanded to know whist she observed 
Jacques&#39; jumpy behaviour. &quot;I assume you are to escort us somewhere?&quot; It 
was the only rational explanation for him wanting to lighten her and her 
partner&#39;s loads the blonde could fathom.

&quot;Yes.... Yes,&quot; Jacques confirmed, nodding again but a decisive solitary 
dip this time, and his voice regaining its strength in the second 
affirmation. &quot;To a safehouse that&#39;s been arranged for your stay. We 
better get moving there now. I was told the feud hasn&#39;t spilled into 
Tokyo&#39;s streets just yet, but who can say when it will?&quot;

&quot;A safehouse?&quot; Mireille questioned. She pondered how &#39;safe&#39; a house that 
Soldats had set up for her and Kirika, allies by the slimmest of margins 
separating friend and foe, truly was. The Corsican assassin would sleep 
lightly in that particular domicile. &quot;Where? In Yokohama?&quot;

&quot;Yokohama?&quot; Jacques parroted, screwing up his face into a grimace of 
incredulity. &quot;Are you kidding? There isn&#39;t a safehouse in the entire 
Kanagawa prefecture that can actually live up to its claim. We&#39;ve been 
practically forced out of the region. Yokohama was one of the first 
cities to give.&quot; The Soldats operative shook his now lowered head and 
clicked his tongue acrimoniously. &quot;You&#39;d be hard pressed to even find 
one of us in that city. If there are any safehouses in Yokohama that 
haven&#39;t been overrun, then you can bet the people in it won&#39;t be poking 
their heads out any time soon.&quot;

&quot;Where then? Here in Tokyo?&quot; Mireille presumed.

&quot;A compromise between Tokyo and Yokohama,&quot; Jacques clarified, tapping a 
forefinger in the air at the blonde. &quot;Literal middle ground in fact, and 
in more ways than you probably suspect. It&#39;s as close as we can get you 
to the enemy&#39;s den without you actually sleeping in it.&quot;

&quot;Where...?&quot; Mireille asked gravely, but the ominous prickling in the 
back of her mind told her she already knew the answer. She reminded 
herself that Soldats were the architects of coincidence.

&quot;Kawasaki,&quot; Jacques said.

*******

Kirika stared out of the taxicab&#39;s rear passenger seat window, her right 
hand under her chin cradling her weary head and her elbow propped 
against the window&#39;s narrow sill for support. Her sombre, weighty gaze 
absorbed every scrap of scenery that reflected in its reddish-brown hue 
as the environ of Kawasaki flashed by; gauging every road, building, and 
landmark with the blueprints the earliest memories she could call her 
own supplied; trying to make matches between them. Kirika&#39;s vantage was 
a literal window into the past--*her* past. Kawasaki was the place of 
her birth, the place where she had lived her meagre former life before 
it had been brightened and fulfilled by the advent of her destined 
partner, Mireille. It was a place the darkhaired girl had thought she 
had left behind never to return to. Yet return Kirika had, and old 
memories were stirring, reviving; roused from slumber in the dusty 
recesses of their keeper&#39;s mind by her coming to the city of their 
origin. Old memories that gave rise to vague feelings in their wake.

Vague as they were, Kirika had nevertheless experienced their like 
before, several times in fact. Whenever she had laid eyes upon a 
fragment of her then lost past; fragments too often linked to 
Soldats--Mireille&#39;s father&#39;s pocket watch found in her bedroom in her 
fictitious family home here in Kawasaki, or Chloe&#39;s throwing knives 
unexpectedly discovered stuck in the necks of Maurice Rubique and his 
police escort that first time at the courthouse back in her real home of 
Paris. The feelings, while sometimes not engendered alone, had at least 
been at the fore. The sensations had been at their most acute when 
Kirika had been wandering the streets of the village that had protected 
the Manor prior to its eradicating razing, and also whilst on the 
grounds and in the halls of the ancient Manor itself. It had been all 
encompassing then, as though Kirika was being bodily immersed in the 
feelings and they were everywhere around her, like a thick fog embracing 
her with misty tendrils of its languid swirls. Strange feelings... like 
a... dreaminess... a sense of the old and long forgotten, with almost 
hallowed undertones. They were neither good nor bad by themselves, 
just... melancholic.

It was quiet in the taxi; the sort of easy hushed calm that Kirika was 
fond of, close to resembling those she shared with Mireille in their 
home in Paris, if not for the extra company. Traffic was thin and the 
ride was smooth, the car&#39;s engine humming a gentle and soothing lullaby 
that floated Kirika&#39;s thoughts away on its droning tune. Talk was sparse 
as well, on the brink of being absent for the whole journey from the 
airport in Tokyo to the safehouse in Kawasaki. Kirika supposed that 
neither Mireille nor Jacques--the restless man the darkhaired girl 
remembered from his sudden appearance at Millet&#39;s headquarters--wanted 
to speak of anything too private in front of the taxi driver. She also 
supposed that her partner didn&#39;t want to speak to her too familiarly in 
the presence of Jacques, a man known to belong to Soldats, the 
organisation the blonde openly abhorred and distrusted. Things to do 
with Soldats usually instilled an obsessive caution in Mireille... and 
put her in a bad, hostile mood.

Not all signs of Mireille&#39;s close relationship to Kirika had evaporated 
upon the Soldats agent&#39;s appearance however, and nor was the younger yet 
still consummate assassin herself unconscious to the activities of those 
around her despite the attention she gave the window. From the rear 
passenger seat adjacent Kirika was awake to the subtle turns of the 
blonde woman&#39;s head in her direction, to the blue eyes shifting askance 
to favour her with appraising, watchful looks every few streets that 
passed by. Mireille&#39;s gaze had been on and off Kirika ever since the 
airport; surreptitious looks glimmering with unspoken concern revisiting 
their worry again and again. Ever since Kawasaki was marked as their 
journey&#39;s final destination and as their residence for their time in 
Japan.

Mireille must have been wondering what the implications of returning to 
Kawasaki, a place akin to Corsica for her, were having on Kirika. What 
Kirika was thinking; what she was feeling. Although still carefully held 
in check, Mireille had a lot of worry for Kirika overall. The girl 
realised it more now that they had gained a deeper understanding of 
their true connection to one another. It was because Mireille cared that 
she fussed; her interest was a blessed sign of her love, warming upon 
the heart and touching upon the soul. Kirika had not known Mireille to 
care about anyone else the way she cared about her. There were her 
associates, her friends; but the affection, if there was any shown at 
all, wasn&#39;t the same, even when it related to her family. Some 
indefinable and fundamental ingredient was missing, something that 
caused Mireille&#39;s normal reservation to soften and wane and free the 
smiling, doting, tender woman it suppressed; a woman who was a stranger 
to everyone else but Kirika. Kirika got to see a side of Mireille that 
no one else seemed to--she got to see the real person behind the canny 
business woman and hard-edged contract killer; she got to see the real 
woman behind the gun. And that woman was gentle and compassionate, and 
warm and loving. An angel disguised as a demon, forced to live in a 
world of darkness. That Kirika knew this woman defined her closeness to 
Mireille. It was a joyful privilege to see her, and an inevitability to 
love her.

Kirika would have liked to set Mireille&#39;s fretting heart and anxious 
mind to rest, but she didn&#39;t really know what she was feeling herself. 
When the city of Kawasaki had been revealed to be where her and 
Mireille&#39;s safehouse was situated, she hadn&#39;t reacted in any overt way. 
She hadn&#39;t been sure how to react or what to feel. It had been shock, 
but no more than a mild one spared a mere short moment of pause and 
surprised bat of eyelids. Kawasaki was a place filled with memory for 
her, but it was still just a place. A big place at that, with only a 
small area of it host to her past. The parts of the city she had once 
walked may not be anywhere near where the Soldats safehouse was. Until 
she could pinpoint whether or not they were anywhere near to her former 
home, her precise sentiments on revisiting her birthplace for the first 
time since leaving it would likely continue to be lost in the cloudy 
realm of the dreamy and melancholic.

Mireille&#39;s attention wasn&#39;t wholly enthralled by Kirika&#39;s plight, 
however. When she wasn&#39;t sneaking glances at her partner the blonde was 
spying on Jacques in the front passenger seat ahead of her with as much 
consideration as her position allowed, the devotion for Kirika that 
softened her gaze exchanged for suspicion that hardened it. The 
rectangular bag for Mireille&#39;s laptop and important documents sat 
upright by the woman&#39;s side, and while her eyes lurked on the Soldats 
agent her right hand laying innocuously on top of it sometimes threw off 
its innocence and took to faintly stroking along its opening, fingers 
toying with the zip. What the bag contained was too valuable for it to 
have been stowed away in the boot of the taxi--important documents from 
Breffort and the blonde&#39;s laptop--but it was also where Mireille had 
stored her weapon for the aeroplane trip, making it crucial luggage to 
remain close by. Mireille was doubtless prepared to unzip her bag and 
pull out her pistol the instant Jacques lived up to her mistrust.

Kirika&#39;s bag was next to her as well, the black sausage taking up the 
rest of the rear passenger seat space separating her and her partner. 
But the girl&#39;s Beretta M1934 wasn&#39;t housed in that bag. It was in its 
classic spot concealed inside a pocket of her parka. Kirika had swiftly 
transferred it from its prior location in her bag to quick reach in her 
pocket in the short interval supplied by her getting into the taxi 
before everyone else, notably before Jacques and the driver. Being 
inside the taxi alone whilst everyone else was outside had screened her 
conspicuous movements and the illegal firearm they had involved, such 
that neither Jacques, the driver, or even any passer-by who might have 
directed an idle look her way could have seen them. In the case where 
Jacques did perform a betrayal or antagonistic action of some kind 
Kirika had him covered, and could possibly react quicker to the danger 
than Mireille. The younger assassin had a clearer line of sight towards 
Jacques from her crosswise angle anyway, so she would notice any threat 
he may suddenly pose earlier than her partner could with her limited 
view. Mireille did have the better shot however, since she could simply 
unload her Walther P99&#39;s magazine point-blank into the back of the 
Soldats operative&#39;s seat.

But Jacques, for his part, wasn&#39;t doing a thing that should feed 
Mireille&#39;s suspicion or that piqued Kirika&#39;s, apart from him being his 
Soldats self. He sat pretty much motionless in the front passenger seat, 
only his head lolling about subject to the consistency of the road 
beneath the taxi&#39;s wheels. He had looked as agitated as the last time 
they had met when Kirika had seen him at Narita Airport, but had calmed 
some during the hushed journey to the safehouse. He still wore his 
sunglasses too, just like he had in Millet&#39;s headquarters. Kirika 
supposed that meant he was really tired again and was hiding dark-ringed 
eyes as Mireille tended to do. His job working for Soldats was probably 
demanding, and his hasty flight from Paris to Japan was unlikely to have 
helped.

Kirika had not eluded her plane trip&#39;s weakening affects either. She 
could never settle into a proper sleep whilst travelling by air, and 
consequently had decided the time was better spent peering out the jet&#39;s 
passenger windows at the purest and most unbridled sky she had ever 
seen, and watching the even grander vision of the most beautiful and 
entrancing woman she had ever seen in slumber beside her. Both majestic 
diversions seemed to really shorten the length of long flights such that 
hours shrunk to minutes, but naturally at the cost of relinquishing 
sleep, although that was a pointless endeavour anyway. Prolonged air 
travel hadn&#39;t always given Kirika trouble with her napping, but as her 
penchant for sleeping pressed close against Mireille had grown so had 
her dependency on it to fall asleep to begin with. The seats on an 
airplane were normally not favoured towards comfortable snuggling 
between two friendly passengers, cursing the girl&#39;s attempts to doze off 
peacefully for any longer than a couple of minutes. And so Kirika simply 
accepted that sleep was unattainable onboard an aeroplane, and embraced 
her aerial pastimes instead. The trade-off was well worth it. She 
wondered if she would have gone without sleep no matter what the case, 
just so she could have a longer chance to lose herself in the beauty 
around her.

While her admiration had exacted its tax of tiredness on her petite 
body, it was nothing Kirika couldn&#39;t cope with. The assassin simply 
ignored the fatigue and concentrated on maintaining her mind&#39;s 
wakefulness, enough so that her senses remained tuned to meticulous 
alertness and her reflexes honed to razor sharpness. Her body would 
follow her will&#39;s direction, shrugging off the weariness like an 
unwanted blanket about the shoulders when required until she could get 
some proper rest. Through mental fortitude alone Kirika could sustain 
herself, such that she could drive her beleaguered body to the brink of 
collapse without sacrificing a shred of its strength or speed before it 
succumbed.

The journey abroad didn&#39;t seem to have agreed with anybody, for Mireille 
displayed evidence of drowsiness too. She didn&#39;t have her sunglasses to 
hide her straining eyes behind, nor could she disguise the pallor of her 
face as anything other than the product of tiredness. For the hours she 
had dedicated to curling up under a blanket on the aeroplane--that being 
the blonde&#39;s routine procedure for long distance air travel--Kirika 
would have predicted Mireille to be as fresh as if she&#39;d been sleeping 
in their bed at home. However, Kirika, in her devoted veneration of her 
snoozing partner, had witnessed Mireille fidget a lot in her seat 
throughout her naptime. Mireille seemed to only reap restive sleep at 
best on every flight they took together, which plainly didn&#39;t do much to 
restore her depleting energy.

Nevertheless, like Kirika, Mireille rose above her sleepiness and stayed 
on her guard, as proved by the watchful eye she had placed Jacques 
under. The built-up surroundings of Kawasaki were treated with a similar 
discrimination during her respites from monitoring Kirika and her 
Soldats nemesis, presumably on the look out for Soldats treachery that 
entailed waylaying the taxi. But Kirika mused whether the reasons for 
Mireille&#39;s curiosity in the sights weren&#39;t in addition a little parallel 
to her own. Mireille had met her for the first time in this city--and 
had been introduced to the agents of Soldats here too, as a matter of 
fact. The young women&#39;s fateful partnership had been forged in this 
place. Kirika wondered if Kawasaki had some significance to Mireille as 
it did to her, perhaps not rousing the same profound emotions, but 
cultivating some sentimental attachment nonetheless because of the 
history that had taken place between them in this city. She wondered if 
Mireille saw the past in the streets that flew by as Kirika herself did, 
and smiled in remembrance of their earliest encounter and time spent 
together. It was a nice thought.

The taxi trundled through a sedate intersection that initially seemed 
like any other, but as the vehicle moved further ahead suddenly Kirika 
was peering down a narrow suburban lane that was a reflection of the 
ethereal blueprints penned in her mind; a solid reflection as real as 
anything else around her, erected right there in reality. Kirika 
remembered that lane. It was long and straight and the road wide enough 
for only one car to drive along, and was flanked by high walls with 
houses on the other sides. Kirika had walked its length to the street 
beyond dressed in her school uniform and carrying her leather satchel on 
her way to and from Tsubaki High School more times than she could count. 
It was a path she had well worn during her old life in Kawasaki, and a 
marker that told her she was halfway to school... or halfway to home.

The familiar lane was gone as quickly as it had emerged into view, and 
it served as a marker of a different kind now. As the taxi continued on 
it was as though Kirika and those with her were passing through a 
barrier, a... portal, an intangible portal into a time long ended... 
into a memory long remembered. Matches for her mind&#39;s blueprints were 
everywhere; the streets and buildings that went by Kirika knew, each new 
one sighted refreshing the dated memory of it she had. It felt so 
surreal, as if she were drifting through a hazy dream, and the deeper 
she went inside it; the farther she was driven down the olden roads away 
from the portal entrance; the more the real world was left behind.

The fuzzy melancholy swelled inside her too, that fuzziness thickening 
more and more from an indolent mist into a dust-laden fog swimming with 
fresh eddies at every old memory&#39;s renewal; each resurgence beating a 
whisk through the mass and spurring it to a faster condensing churn. 
Wistfulness flowed as the fog billowed, as did an odd reverence for the 
old sights seen. They were from another life after all; a life for all 
its shortcomings Kirika still cherished the memories of. The taxi and 
Kirika with it followed those memories, tracing them back to their 
beginning. Tracing them back to the root of that old life--to the grave 
of it.

A few more familiar streets and remembered turns later the taxi rolled 
to a stop. Virtually consumed in a light-headed trance Kirika climbed 
out of the car, dragging her bag mechanically with her, her mind as 
mesmerised as her staring eyes. There it was. The house Kirika had 
awakened to the world in, the first place she had called home, where she 
had first spawned her own memories and lived her own life. Kirika had 
thought she would never see it again. As though it had ceased to exist 
the instant she had left it and the life she had lived in it behind, the 
house enduring only in her mind. But here it was, looking the same as 
always. Brick and mortar still stood steady, the garden still thrived in 
its greenery, and the property gave off no sense of abandonment. Instead 
it was as if the house had remained static up until Kirika&#39;s return. 
Stuck in time--eternal, unchanging. Waiting. It was as though she really 
was looking back in time, into her mind&#39;s recorded image of the past, 
gazing at a memory ripped straight from there and transferred to the 
living, breathing world. It was like *being* in the past, walking in it, 
walking in the very memories contained in her head. And it felt wrong. A 
wrong step placed, a wrong path taken. Like Kirika wasn&#39;t supposed to 
have ever come back. Not back to the beginning. Not back to a life 
already departed. It was a grave that shouldn&#39;t be disturbed.

The orange of sunset twilight streaking the sky overhead basked the 
house in its glow, feeding the illusorily ambiance that swallowed Kirika 
whole. The surrealism was at its most potent on the street in front of 
the young assassin&#39;s first and former home, as was the melancholy, the 
latter still keen in the face of the emergent sensation of wrongness. 
The house exuded feelings of sacredness too like the roads leading to it 
earlier, and as with the others they were strongest here. This house was 
the origin of them all, just as it was the origin of Kirika. Its history 
gave it its power, the girl was beginning to understand. It was a 
hallowed site to her because of what had occurred within its walls, 
because of the importance of those events and how they fit into her 
life. She had been born here, she had allied with Mireille here, and she 
had lived a life here.

It was the last that tainted the house&#39;s eminence, distorting it into 
something that burgeoned painful regret and woeful longing at every 
glimpse its way. The bulk of Kirika&#39;s memories concerning Kawasaki were 
weaved with such. All but the closing little fraction of her previous 
time in this city was borne stagnating in an empty existence with 
loneliness as her solitary companion, though interposed with the mundane 
contentment of normality... albeit normality eventually punctured on a 
near daily basis by the surfacing of Soldats and its aggression. The 
everyday routine of her life was the only thing she looked back on with 
some extent of fondness, her union with Mireille aside. It was lost to 
her now, lost with the desertion of that life, although she&#39;d had a 
measly grasp of it back then anyway. Still, Kirika didn&#39;t like being 
reminded of that loss--it made her pine for its recovery all the more 
ardently--and here outside her old home the memories were at their 
freshest.

It wasn&#39;t the only past hurt rekindled. Within the house the ghosts of 
loneliness and meaninglessness awaited Kirika. She couldn&#39;t help but 
remember the ills that had worn on her life at its start. How they had 
felt. The pain of them. The ache for change. Those ghosts would haunt 
her inside that house. They were already starting to now. Kirika was 
disrupting their rest revisiting her bygone residence, evoking memories 
and feelings better left alone in time-fostered obscurity. They would 
not let her go unpunished.

This was a house of fruitless dreams and hollow lives. A house built on 
lies and misery. This was not Kirika&#39;s home. Maybe it never really had 
been.

There was breathing on Kirika&#39;s neck--serene, gentle, steady and hushed. 
Over her shoulder, behind her back, just shy of the corner of her eye 
she could feel *her*. Kirika&#39;s other self, the darkness, the voice, 
Altena, or whoever or whatever it was. It was there, behind her, perhaps 
prodded from wherever it had been skulking in Kirika&#39;s mind, silent as 
it was still, by the girl&#39;s trek through her memories of the past. She 
could not so much hear the breathing but *feel* it, *sense*it, like a 
mouth with lips parted and words ready on tongue.

Kirika&#39;s body tensed severely, waiting, expecting new whispers to chime 
through her thoughts, invade her mind, the poison commentary by a dead 
woman in service of a younger trapped one. But the quiet lingered on. It 
was there, the darkness, the voice, yet it did nothing; said nothing. In 
some ways it was worse. Agitating, unnerving. It was cold outside the 
taxi, the icy winds coming close to buffeting, but sweat slicked 
Kirika&#39;s forehead. It was as cold as the weather.

Suddenly there was a very real weight on Kirika&#39;s left shoulder. Panic 
shot through her just as quickly, and her head snapped instantly to the 
presence, a muted gasp blown between her lips.

It was Mireille&#39;s placid smiling face that materialised in Kirika&#39;s 
vision, as compassionate as it was soothing to the smaller girl. She 
should have known. The hand resting on her shoulder was far too tender 
to have belonged to something... or someone... bad. Relief came as 
swiftly as panic had, but poured into Kirika instead of slashing through 
her insides. Her knotted muscles slackened, her stiff left shoulder 
visibly sinking under her partner&#39;s pacifying hand.

Mireille&#39;s gentle and caring smile grew just a little bit, and she 
squeezed Kirika&#39;s shoulder softly. Nothing was said before the blonde 
let her hand drop and she turned away, moving towards the back of the 
taxi and its open boot to collect the rest of her luggage to go with the 
laptop bag dangling from her shoulder. However, the woman&#39;s message was 
clear. Kirika was not alone.

Mere moments had gone by since Kirika had stepped out of the taxi, mere 
heartbeats, but it had felt like those moments had been stretched into a 
whole lifetime, the past lifetime she had already lived. Her heart, 
which she hadn&#39;t been aware was leaping in her chest, was quieting down, 
and the perspiration spotting her brow was close to drying in the cool 
winds wafting her hair. The surrealism enveloping the house had waned, 
its edge dulled greatly if not altogether, the dream awakened from and 
the regression into the past ended, with reality and the present 
regaining their purchase. The invisible presence over Kirika&#39;s shoulder, 
the low breathing down her neck, had vanished too. Chased off by 
Mireille--the darkness cast out by the light, the demon fleeing before 
the angel. Mireille had broken Kirika free from her trance; led her out 
of the mire of malicious memories she had been ensnared in with a mere 
affectionate touch and encouraging smile. Kirika&#39;s battle with her 
sinister twin was her own to wage, her inner turmoils hers to surmount 
unaccompanied, but aid for all of her troubles was always nearby. The 
girl knew she could rely on Mireille and her support if she ever asked 
for it. However, Kirika hoped she would never become desperate enough to 
have need to.

Not every feeling that the sight of her old house engendered in Kirika 
had been expelled. They had lost part of their thrall over Kirika, but 
few had followed the surrealism in its fade. The same misgivings, the 
same sadness, hung over her like a pall as she looked upon their abode. 
Ghosts were not so easily banished.

Kirika shut the taxi&#39;s passenger door quietly and joined Mireille at the 
back of the vehicle just as the blonde was hefting her suitcase from the 
boot to the street, plopping it down on its wheels with a little heaved 
sigh of exertion. She closed the boot, and before Kirika could take it 
herself Mireille had dragged her suitcase over the stubborn curb and 
onto the pavement, all without so much as throwing her obliging partner 
a glance. Kirika would have happily lugged the suitcase on Mireille&#39;s 
behalf, now more than ever to assuage her partner&#39;s exhaustion, but the 
older woman usually reclaimed her luggage at the finish of a long 
journey. Kirika wasn&#39;t sure why she did that, nor did she have a guess 
as to why Mireille had repossessed her luggage so soon after landing at 
the airport on this trip. Customs to the taxi outside the airport was a 
stretch of time where the petite girl normally had her love&#39;s burden in 
her hands. Kirika supposed that right at this moment Mireille wanted to 
continue to keep any shred of familiarity they shared masked from 
Jacques. Or maybe that wasn&#39;t it. Sometimes Mireille was so hard to 
figure out when they were not side-by-side in carnage with guns in their 
grasps. They were Noir, connected, tied together by threads of fate, 
meant to understand each other&#39;s hearts perfectly... but that was just 
an ancient belief. Maybe it would come to be one day, when their love 
had prospered to its full and glorious bloom. Yes. The day would come.

The taxi drove away, leaving Kirika and Mireille and Jacques at the 
roadside, the last putting his wallet back in his suit pocket after 
paying the driver. Jacques picked up his briefcase from the footpath 
where he had placed it by his leg and then offered the pair of assassins 
an unsteady smile.

&quot;After you,&quot; Mireille said, grim-faced once again.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jacques replied with coolness at odds with his nervous 
bearing. He walked ahead of his stony overseer and her less threatening 
companion and through the already open gate of the house, past the front 
garden and to the porch steps.

Mireille trailed after him, watching his every movement and the house 
that loomed at the fore with careful notice, her gaze never long from 
either. Kirika followed her, feet plodding, dragging like the blonde 
dragged her suitcase, though without the smoothness wheels endowed. The 
troubled girl&#39;s eyes flitted to the wall that separated the house from 
the street as she passed it, the topmost railing a head taller than her 
just as she remembered. She caught sight of the scuffed nameplate 
mounted on the nearest edge of the wall, near the entrance to the house. 
Yuumura, it said. More evidence of her old home&#39;s standstill in time. 
Kirika didn&#39;t believe that anybody else had lived in it after she had 
left. It was like this house had been made for her. Maybe it had been. 
Altena had commanded that kind of power.

The mailbox set on the porch was empty, showing that someone at least 
took care of the mail that tended to accumulate to massive proportions 
if you didn&#39;t clear it out frequently. Junk mail, Mireille called it. 
Never anything addressed to Kirika Yuumura specifically, not in all the 
time she had lived here. Not in all her life. The lie only went so far.

The porch light was on, shedding light on Jacques while he slid a key 
into the front door&#39;s lock. It was as though the light had been switched 
on by itself, anticipating Kirika&#39;s return. Dread was welling up in the 
pit of her stomach as she reluctantly climbed the porch steps, her 
attention glued on the door, awaiting the moment it would be swung open, 
letting out the pains entombed behind it. Kirika stood close to Mireille 
on the porch, so close they were almost touching. The girl wished they 
could touch.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Jacques announced, as if opening the door to Kirika&#39;s past 
was nothing. He did just that, unlocking the front door and walking into 
the house, then fumbling in the shadows for a light switch that Kirika 
knew was just next to the entrance, on the left hand section of wall.

Jacques eventually found the switch and bright light reinforced dusk&#39;s 
soft radiance previously bathing the small foyer and larger room ahead. 
Stooping down slightly and lifting his right foot up, he undid the laces 
of his brown leather shoe and then flicked it off to drop onto the green 
tiles lining the genkan with his free hand, that shoe closely followed 
by its mate. &quot;This will get irritating,&quot; Kirika heard him sigh under his 
breath.

Mireille squeezed her way into the genkan at Jacques&#39; back and after 
depositing her suitcase against a wall, began to work on removing her 
own footwear, unzipping her high-heeled leather boots and pulling them 
off her slender ankles and elegant feet, losing a few inches of height 
in the process. She yet retained a close eye on the nearby Soldats 
agent, not trusting to leave him free of watch even for these ephemeral 
moments.

Kirika dithered at the house&#39;s entrance. No ghosts had assailed her at 
the breach of the front door, only more memories of the past; of the 
countless times she had donned her shoes and taken them off in that 
genkan, coming and going across this threshold. But she feared that they 
might only be prowling deeper inside the rooms and halls, searching for 
the moment to pounce.

Mireille rose to standing once she had rather messily arranged her 
floppy boots at the lip of the genkan, near her similarly discarded 
suitcase. She looked over her shoulder to where Kirika wavered behind 
her at the doorway, the woman&#39;s lovely profile suddenly appearing from 
around the flaxen curtain spilling down her back. A blue eye of hers 
beckoned, and the curve of her mouth was gently persuading. &quot;Kirika,&quot; 
Mireille said.

As if something had nudged her lightly but compellingly forwards, 
Kirika&#39;s feet shuffled from the porch outside to the genkan inside in a 
single timid step. Nothing awful happened, and Kirika breathed a little 
easier. Just a little.

Mireille spared Kirika another moment to bolster the timorous girl&#39;s 
nerves with her patient smile before Jacques quickly lured away her 
attention again as he stepped out of the genkan and into the connecting 
room. She tailed him, her bare feet padding mutely across the buffed 
hardwood floor.

Kirika put her bag down next to the wall opposite Mireille&#39;s suitcase, 
and then shut the front door quietly. Carefully she slipped her feet out 
of her pink shoes, pushing them beside her partner&#39;s boots when she was 
done, and then went to join Mireille and Jacques in the adjoining room. 
Kirika&#39;s footfalls were even more subdued than Mireille&#39;s, her socks 
hushing to a degree, but the young assassin&#39;s apprehension lightening 
her steps was the most effective silencer.

The room styled in the old-fashioned Japanese manner was the first in 
the house to reacquaint itself with Kirika. It was the largest room in 
the dwelling yet also the most sparsely decorated in accustom to its 
traditional vein, the lone piece of furniture a kotatsu in the centre of 
a span of flooring layered with tatami mats. The small, stumpy table had 
an ashtray on it, positioned exactly as Kirika remembered leaving it. 
The ashtray was still spotless as well, and Kirika wondered if it had 
ever been used. It hadn&#39;t been in her time here.

There were several pictures on the walls, some even high above the trim 
and tidy alcoves and cabinets, hanging bare inches lower than the 
ceiling. A few were traditional Japanese calligraphy and artwork framed 
for display to fit the theme of the room, but most were family 
photographs. Kirika&#39;s family. However, the people in them were no family 
that the girl knew. There was a picture of who was presumably meant to 
be her grandmother, a black and white photograph that looked old. 
Others, in colour, were of her pretend mother and father in seemingly 
pleasant moments, one with her encompassed in the shot. She was smiling 
cheerfully in it, her mouth open wide. She looked very happy. Kirika 
wondered how she could be like that, if the merriment was a lie too. She 
hadn&#39;t thought her mouth was even capable of a smile that big, or her 
face able to appear so trouble-free knowing the sins she was laden with. 
But then, Kirika hadn&#39;t made that smile. She had no memory of it or of 
the woman and man posing beside her in the photo. It was a smile 
belonging to her other self in a life that warped twin had led. It was 
amazing that the darkness had the capacity to show such unadulterated 
joy. Perhaps it--*she*--had really known their faux parents? Or was her 
delight really merely a fabrication?

Whatever the truth, Kirika herself felt no connection at all to any of 
her supposed family members. They were just strangers to her, faces no 
more meaningful than those belonging to passers-by in the street. Kirika 
didn&#39;t have a family. Parents... relatives.... These were rudiments that 
other people were born with. Not Kirika. She had come into this world 
alone. No mother&#39;s comforting embrace or father&#39;s warm smile had greeted 
her; no blood ties had been forged when she took her first breath. 
Perhaps it had been different far, far back in the past for her younger 
self, but that was a life belonging to another girl.

That she would never experience the love and care of a family made 
Kirika sad, but it was a distant, indistinct ache. How could she mourn 
for something she had never known? The closest Kirika had to family was 
Mireille. And Mireille&#39;s love and care outshined all others. Kirika 
didn&#39;t need a real family.

&quot;This is it, your home-sweet-home,&quot; Jacques said as he walked to the 
kotatsu in the middle of the room, swinging his head to each wall in 
appraisal. He turned around to face Mireille and Kirika, adjusting his 
sunglasses with a brief touch from his thumb and forefinger. &quot;He said 
you would like this place.&quot;

&quot;It will do,&quot; Mireille replied simply, giving nothing away.

Jacques just smiled diplomatically and then sat down at the far end of 
the squat table, plunking his briefcase on it. &quot;Why is this table so 
low?&quot; he griped immediately afterwards. He kept rearranging his legs 
this way and that; sometimes crossing them, sometimes sticking them 
underneath the kotatsu; seeming on a tricky quest to get comfortable. 
But finally they stilled, the Soldats operative finding a balance with 
one leg bent and upright, and the other similarly bent but flat on the 
floor under the table.

Mireille walked to the opposite side of the kotatsu and lowered her 
laptop bag by its strap to the floor, alongside a table leg. She then 
shed her coat and tossed it over the bag before kneeling down at the 
kotatsu across from Jacques, tucking her legs smartly underneath 
herself. Unlike Jacques, Mireille had sat at this table before.

Kirika knelt beside Mireille in the same way a moment later, legs folded 
neatly underneath her bottom, squashing into the little space remaining 
at that particular edge of the small table on the blonde&#39;s left hand 
side, the side that wasn&#39;t occupied by her laptop bag. The petite girl 
didn&#39;t mind the tight fit though, and especially not the close proximity 
to Mireille it accorded. Their neighbouring bare thighs were almost 
touching, the tiny, titillating gap separating them taunting Kirika to 
part her legs ever so slightly or even lean a bit against her partner 
and close that gap. But she knew she would never do either. She would 
never breach that gap or any other separating them without invitation. 
So instead she sat there very still and straight-backed, savouring the 
nearness she did have with her love, while trying to forget the ghosts 
the house harboured.

Two simultaneous clicks snapped the stillness in the room--the 
house--announcing the unlocking of the Soldats agent&#39;s briefcase. 
Jacques&#39; face was all seriousness now as he cracked open the briefcase, 
the abrupt turnaround leaving Kirika questioning if the nervous, fidgety 
man she had witnessed beforehand had really existed.

Kirika sensed Mireille tense beside her at Jacques&#39; actions, the 
blonde&#39;s back becoming as straight as a board while her hand strayed 
once again to her bag next to her. Conversely, Kirika was impassive and 
unmoving, giving away no sign that she had seen anything potentially 
suspect. That by no means meant she was any less alert than her partner. 
If Jacques were to produce a weapon of some kind from inside that 
briefcase of his, Kirika would flip the kotatsu on its edge in the space 
it took him to hurl a knife or pull a trigger; a makeshift shield at a 
moment&#39;s notice. And before Jacques could follow up his initial attack 
with another he&#39;d be already dead, two bullets from two guns delivering 
his demise.

But that violence ensued only in Kirika&#39;s head. In reality Jacques 
retrieved an innocuous enough stack of paper from the innards of his 
briefcase and dropped it with a slap in the middle of the table. He 
prodded it with his finger a few times towards Mireille.

&quot;There&#39;s the information relevant to our... situation... in this 
region,&quot; Jacques said, nodding his head at the paper heap and then 
shrinking back, as if the pile were something repulsive to him. &quot;Right 
now Kawasaki is the only city in this prefecture worth having that we 
still maintain some control over. How long that control will last....&quot; 
He paused, sucking in a breath through clenched teeth. &quot;Well, that&#39;s 
presently being contested,&quot; Jacques went on, flashing a dry smirk. It 
fell away quickly. &quot;Kawasaki is all that buffers our primary Japanese 
power base in Tokyo from Ishinomori&#39;s movement. If Kawasaki falls under 
her sway, the capitol will be open to the brunt of her offensive 
straight from nearby Yokohama, and her influence in this country would 
be significantly increased if she should somehow manage to take it. 
Naturally this is undesirable. We want Kaede Ishinomori&#39;s splinter group 
stripped of its ability to pose a threat before our presence in Kawasaki 
has a chance to wane, and before the authorities governing Tokyo can 
become perverted to her cause.&quot;

&quot;And we are to do that? We&#39;re not here to win your war, or at your 
convenience for that matter,&quot; Mireille stated coldly. &quot;We&#39;ll see to 
Kaede Ishinomori if that is what it will take to prove to Soldats we are 
non-aggressors in this. But that&#39;s all, whether it derails your revolt 
or not.&quot;

Jacques cleared his throat uncomfortably, the jumpy man resurfacing. He 
squirmed in his spot on the floor, laying his right forearm across his 
upright knee with forced casualness, and then nodded his head in a slow 
show of prudent surrender. &quot;As you say. Any assistance you provide will 
be valued.&quot;

The Soldats operative&#39;s right hand drew back to his jacket pocket over 
his heart seemingly of its own accord, bony fingers absently starting to 
pluck free the cigarette that had made a short appearance before at the 
airport. The cigarette peeking halfway out of its home, Jacques nodded 
his head at the ashtray on the table. &quot;Do you mind?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mireille declared without possibility of negotiation. She hooked 
a finger over the rim of the ashtray and then unceremoniously dragged it 
from the middle of the kotatsu to near her, well out of range of 
Jacques&#39; cigarette if he should unwisely choose to light it.

Jacques coughed nervously a second time, covering his mouth with his 
fist after discreetly pushing the cigarette back inside his pocket. 
&quot;Like I said, I&#39;m your contact within Soldats forces here,&quot; he proceeded 
with a decrease in aplomb. &quot;Your *sole* contact. I&#39;m the only person in 
the whole of Japan that knows you are working for us, for Soldats. You 
understand; you are regarded as rather like outlaws to us. Taboo. Your 
relationship with our mutual employer cannot be broadcast. It would... 
cause problems.&quot;

&quot;We are working *with* you. And I know. We don&#39;t expect any real help 
from you because of that either,&quot; Mireille said, her words with a bite 
to them. Kirika wasn&#39;t sure why that incensed her partner so. The 
darkhaired assassin was sure that Mireille preferred working alone 
anyway, just the two of them. Kirika liked it that way too. She had 
never known anything different. She didn&#39;t *want* to know anything 
different.

&quot;Ahh... alright then,&quot; Jacques said wanly. Kirika noticed him swallow. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been told you know that Kaede Ishinomori has had trouble with the 
law lately,&quot; he continued. &quot;Her trial is very close, but the case will 
be thrown out for sure. Ishinomori and her cohorts have seen to that. 
However, it is a prime time for you to... well....&quot; Jacques waved his 
right hand as though he could fan the words he was looking for from the 
air to his mouth. &quot;...You know, do your thing,&quot; he finally settled on.

&quot;We&#39;ll do it when *we* decide,&quot; Mireille retorted. &quot;*Our* way. If 
Soldats won&#39;t give us assistance, then they can keep their interference 
to themselves as well.&quot;

Jacques said something else to placate Kirika&#39;s prickly partner, but his 
quavering voice had floated away from the girl&#39;s ears. Mireille&#39;s 
captivating tones had drifted too, become faint as if the blonde were 
speaking through a gag of cotton balls. Kirika&#39;s mind was enticed 
elsewhere, and had been piece by piece whilst her love and the Soldats 
operative&#39;s exchange hummed on from a lengthening distance. Her head was 
incessantly bid by an invisible finger on her chin to turn from her 
reflection in the shiny surface of the kotatsu to the yawning opening 
framing the room on her left. Her ears picked up a voice only she could 
hear, ringing clearer above the others, chasing them away; a beckoning 
that tugged her attention towards it.

The room next door took up the rest of the house&#39;s ground floor, a 
somewhat cramped space comprising of a kitchen and a small living area, 
the latter equipped with a television and computer. Seeing the computer 
ignited a fresh slew of memories to spark inside Kirika&#39;s head; visions 
of her sitting in front of its screen, her face illuminated by its 
promising glow while she perused the background of one Mireille Bouquet; 
assassin for hire; and hoping that this woman could bring enlightenment 
to her life. Kirika wondered if the information was still there in that 
computer even now, that road-sign to her and her partner&#39;s pilgrimage 
for the past, left undisturbed like everything else in the house she had 
seen so far. Mireille might like to read it if it was.

But it wasn&#39;t the computer or anything else particular to that room that 
exerted an attraction in Kirika. It was what lay above it, and the means 
to get there. The stairs to the second storey of the house were in that 
room, and it was from the top of them that the summons tumbled down. 
Maybe it was the ghosts speaking to her in their silent yet beguiling 
lilt, whispering in the air, gossamer voices carried on a breeze. The 
whispers reminded Kirika of the ones that haunted the caverns of her 
mind as opposed to the halls of a house, and she took a moment to listen 
inside them for the telltale echoes. But there was nothing. Empty 
darkness and quiet; not even rasping breaths in the murk. Different 
spectres were harassing Kirika this time.

The ghosts beseeched the hypnotised girl to come closer, implored her 
feet to climb those wooden stairs that connected to more memories buried 
in the past. Kirika would have to sooner or later. She would be staying 
in this house again, and the ghosts she would be taking up residence 
with would have to be greeted. Faced.

With lissom movements Kirika quietly slipped away from the kotatsu and 
Mireille&#39;s side, coaxed by the soft ethereal murmurs or compelled by her 
kindled courage, or maybe a mixture of both. If Mireille or Jacques 
noticed her go, she was oblivious to their looks. Kirika was focused on 
those stairs, at the behest of the invisible finger under her chin 
pulling her nearer. She didn&#39;t like leaving Mireille, but her petite 
feet stole over the tatami mats without thought, taking her out of the 
room and to the stairs, then up them, further into the past, deeper into 
the realm of old spirits.

Upstairs seemed somehow quieter, stiller, than the rest of the house 
below. The only light here was from the setting sun, and just like 
outside wherever the feeble rays hit sacrosanct surrealism bloomed. 
There was more dust here than downstairs; a thin coating on banisters 
and windowsills and more marking the time gone, shining in dusk&#39;s ruddy, 
dwindling, flame. Kirika left fingerprints and footprints in it as she 
went by, the signs of her return. No one had been up here for the period 
she had been off with Mireille in France. No one. This place at least 
really had been waiting for her.

The door to Kirika&#39;s imaginary parents&#39; bedroom was open, and the girl 
glanced inside the room as she walked by. She had only been inside that 
room once, during her explorations after she had awakened in these then 
unfamiliar surroundings. She had left the room pretty much how she had 
initially discovered it. There was nothing in there except more 
foundations to the nevertheless flimsy lie that was Kirika Yuumura&#39;s 
normal background--her normal life. The bedroom had never had the 
feeling that it had ever been lived in; the bed ever slept in, the 
clothes in the wardrobes ever worn. It still had that feeling. A single 
cursory glance inside was enough.

Kirika&#39;s feet drove her onwards. She knew where they were going. It was 
where the ghosts gathered for their poignant commune. Her old bedroom 
was the last doorway near the end of the hall.

The door to Kirika&#39;s old bedroom was wide open too, like she used to 
keep it since creaking it open to explore the strange world outside the 
womb of blue-painted walls that had birthed her. It was from here the 
ghosts called, here that more of Kirika&#39;s memories waited to be 
remembered. Those memories taunted the girl&#39;s brain; scurrying around 
the fringes of her mind&#39;s eye like monsters hiding in the shadows. 
Images flickered with every scampering footfall, as though each struck 
an ember close to the paintings recounting her old life.

The salvo of memory flashes caused Kirika&#39;s feet to waver, her step 
beginning to degenerate to a shuffle as the spectres&#39; beckoning lost its 
potence under the burst of mind sparks. Kirika&#39;s nerve quaked, and her 
fingers curled to make fists. She was scared of what the ghosts had in 
store for her; what stories of woe they&#39;d tell, what old scabs they&#39;d 
tear off. But while her stride slowed, it didn&#39;t stop. The ghosts 
*would* be faced. Kirika didn&#39;t run away from her past anymore.

Kirika&#39;s pulse was quick and her breath short when she braved standing 
in the doorway of her old bedroom, foreseeing a throng of hurtful 
hauntings to leap out at her from inside the room and from inside her 
mind. But nothing jumped out. Nothing materialised out of the thin air 
in front of her or from the room&#39;s shadows to spook Kirika, at least not 
in the manner she had predicted. A quiet sadness emanated from the 
bedroom; benign waves of despondency gently enveloping the girl like a 
fine vapour--the ethereal embraces of ghosts.

Kirika realised that the spectres weren&#39;t really cruel or malicious. 
They were just... sad. She had been summoned by their tortured moans, by 
their calls of pain--*her* pain. Kirika had spawned these spirits; they 
were *her* ghosts, her sad longing for the little peace and ordinariness 
her past life had contained birthing their shape and affliction. The 
melancholy she had been feeling before on the way to the house, outside 
it, and finally inside it didn&#39;t find its source in anything around her. 
Not from the house, not from this room. It came from the ghosts, and 
they came from Kirika. They haunted her mind, not the house.

Her ghosts&#39; embrace washed away whatever fear Kirika had, leaving behind 
a room of reminders and a girl taken by reminiscence. That was what 
everything in this house was from her old bedroom to the computer 
downstairs--purely reminders of a past lived through. And the most 
potent reminders were all present in Kirika&#39;s former bedroom.

Like the rest of the house, not a single facet of the room varied from 
the recollection of it the darkhaired girl&#39;s memories narrated to her. 
Everything was in its place; everything on top of the long chest of 
drawers set against the right-hand wall, everything on the desk directly 
to her left; *everything*, as though Kirika had vacated the room mere 
minutes ago, or had never vacated it to begin with.

The bed, the dominating presence in the room and to Kirika, attracted 
the spellbound girl first. With steps shy thanks to reminiscence&#39;s 
charm, she entered the bedroom and approached bed, the covers tucked in 
and the pillows arranged neatly as if in preparation for her to spend 
the night in it. Her memories placed her lying on that bed, blinking her 
eyes open to the room around her, and on the nights subsequent to that 
one she had slept there again, but fleetingly compared to her seeming 
long torpor that had stolen more than a decade&#39;s worth of her life. 
Seeing it again made her recall the disorientation she had experienced 
upon awakening, the confusion that had subverted her mind with only one 
word as a guide through the blank muddle. But beyond that, Kirika wasn&#39;t 
sure what to feel. Her feelings were jumbled and hard to isolate, but 
most every one was coated with gloom--sadness, regret, and longing the 
routine triumvirate.

Kirika turned, and then moved to the desk that had once been the keeper 
of an artefact that had been the chain joining her, Mireille, and 
Soldats together and of a deadly weapon and its ammunition that had 
claimed many lives while wielded in her unenthusiastic but expert hands. 
She felt compelled to open the top drawer, just like she had done 
shortly after waking up in the very bed behind her. Kirika did just 
that, pulling it open smoothly and softly, mimicking motions performed a 
long time ago. It was empty of artefact, weapon, and ammunition, of 
course. Gone now, lost to the rigours of her and Mireille&#39;s pilgrimage 
with merely the cloth the items had once laid on as a memento. None 
would be missed.

&quot;Perhaps we should sleep separately now that you have your old bedroom 
back. I noticed another bedroom down the hall that would suit me fine.&quot;

Kirika looked up from the empty drawer to the doorway enclosing a 
fair-haired and fair-skinned angel sculptured by the heavens and steered 
by fate to her. Mireille had her shoulder to the doorjamb, leaning her 
body nonchalantly against it with her arms folded and one bare leg bent 
behind the other, the ball of her foot tapping the floor absently. The 
teasing smile that Kirika had had cast in her direction many times 
brightened the blonde&#39;s already beautiful face, and her blue eyes had a 
twinkle to them that the younger girl had learned to be... wary... 
around. Despite that, Mireille was a vision in the faltering sunlight, 
an uplifting beacon for Kirika&#39;s solemn eyes and a balm for her troubled 
mind. Kirika hadn&#39;t been aware of her partner&#39;s arrival, the knowledge 
blockaded on account of her thoughts being swept up in the past or 
because of the woman&#39;s bare feet on the carpet muffling her approach. 
But Kirika was glad Mireille was here.

Kirika&#39;s face must have portrayed her anxiousness at Mireille&#39;s remarks, 
for the blonde&#39;s smile swelled to a big grin and the blue in her gaze 
sparkled with all the more gleeful intensity. &quot;I didn&#39;t think so,&quot; she 
said in mirth. She tossed Kirika a playful wink; a gesture that elicited 
several full blinks from the girl herself, unused to such behaviour. 
Kirika was, however, used to Mireille&#39;s strange amusements--most of 
which were centred on her--but &#39;used to&#39; didn&#39;t mean she understood it 
at all. It was hard for her to tell when her partner was joking or not, 
having a tendency to take the woman&#39;s words at their face value. To 
Kirika&#39;s dismay, that seemed to make Mireille jest more frequently, and 
also seemed to heighten her enjoyment of it.

Mireille&#39;s carefree mood turned out to not be as infectious as Kirika 
would have liked. As quick as her heart had elated at her love&#39;s 
appearance, her ghosts had moaned again of their--her--turmoil. Kirika&#39;s 
heart deflated and her visage came to bear the weary strain of a haunted 
soul once more. It was a face that fit her comfortably--she had worn it 
often in her short life.

&quot;I missed you downstairs,&quot; Mireille said, the humour fading from her 
voice and expression. &quot;Jacques is gone. I shooed him back to his 
masters. He had nothing of importance to say anyway.&quot;

&quot;Mm...&quot; Kirika mumbled monotonously as she closed the desk drawer as 
carefully as she had slid it open. Her head turned back towards the 
bedroom&#39;s doorway, but it wasn&#39;t Mireille that secured her notice this 
time. The sailor top of her school uniform still hung on the coat stand 
behind the door, as though waiting for her to take it and wear it to 
another day of classes at Tsubaki High School like nothing had happened; 
like she hadn&#39;t been off in France or had met Mireille, or had 
confronted Altena at the Manor and found out the mysteries behind the 
title &#39;Noir&#39;. It was like a life on pause, yet Kirika had no hope of 
picking it up where she had left off.

&quot;Feeling nostalgic?&quot; Mireille asked softly.

Nostalgic. A word for what Kirika was feeling as a whole. Yet it didn&#39;t 
seem enough. It was more than just being nostalgic. The feelings were 
dug from deeper inside her, cut deeper, and the melancholy monumental. 
Nostalgic was too small a word to describe Kirika&#39;s feelings.

Wordlessly Kirika walked over to the uniform top, the trappings of a 
different girl that stood before it now. Mireille&#39;s eyes never wandered 
from her, the blonde&#39;s look a conduit for her sizable worry. How to make 
her understand? The ghosts flitting around in Kirika&#39;s head blurred and 
spun the words needed for her to tell of what she was enduring, but she 
snatched at them as best she could, wanting Mireille to know. And 
Mireille wanted to know too, Kirika recognised. Mireille wanted her to 
share the weight of her troubles, to help shoulder her burdens. This was 
one Kirika could share, one where her twin didn&#39;t darken the tale. Her 
darkness was the only affliction she would keep to herself indefinitely.

&quot;It had been a lie,&quot; Kirika spoke quietly, staring at the uniform top as 
she fashioned her feelings into words from the clutter in her head. &quot;But 
it had been a lie I was comfortable with. I wanted to believe it. I 
wanted... I wanted what everyone else had.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s hand took out her student card from a pocket of her parka, and 
then she looked down at it where it lay in her palm. The full-length 
mirror beside her caught her movement, and it captured her gaze too soon 
after. She remembered holding something different while looking into 
that mirror. A gun. *Her* gun. It had felt natural to her hands, more 
natural than this card. Kirika dropped her gaze to the student ID again; 
at the girl in it wearing a school uniform of the type her former 
classmates had. But underneath the clothes she had been different from 
them. She had been a demon disguised as a normal girl. Trying to be 
something she was not. &quot;I wanted to be her. I wanted to be Kirika 
Yuumura.&quot;

Raising her heavy head, Kirika reached out and slipped the obsolete 
student card into the pocket of the sailor suit she had donned for her 
charade. The card disappeared easily inside the pocket, returned to the 
place she had originally discovered it. The life it was associated with 
had ended a long time ago.

Moments of silent reflection elapsed in seeming eternities, eternities 
where Kirika lived a different life than she did now. But the eternities 
succumbed when Kirika felt soft warmth against her back. She blinked 
down at the arm beneath her chin that was smoothing a course across her 
chest, tantalising her skin left exposed by her spaghetti strap top, and 
holding her close to the reassuring presence behind her. An enchanting 
scent delighted her nose; that wonderful bouquet that always caressed 
the corners of her mouth, enticing a blissful smile--the wonderful 
bouquet of a wonderful Bouquet.

Mireille&#39;s left arm around Kirika coaxed her to turn to face the mirror, 
and the image of the woman&#39;s compassionate eyes found hers in the glass. 
She saw that Mireille was stooped over a little to match her shorter 
height, her partner&#39;s chin near Kirika&#39;s left shoulder and her lips by 
her ear, with some of her blonde tresses blanketing the girl&#39;s upper arm 
in a silky cascade.

&quot;We are who we are,&quot; Mireille said gently into Kirika&#39;s ear while 
absorbing her partner&#39;s sad reddish-brown gaze with her sympathetic blue 
in the mirror. &quot;Wicked people took away many of your choices from 
you--from us. We can regret it all we like, but it won&#39;t change the 
past. All we can do is live on in the present.&quot;

The Mireille in the mirror smiled, and her right arm stretched over 
Kirika&#39;s shoulder for the old uniform top. Graceful fingers deftly 
retrieved the student card out of the uniform top&#39;s pocket, and then 
held it in front of the mirror for Kirika to see.

&quot;And this is who you are in the present. There has only ever been one 
Kirika Yuumura to me. I met her in this city, where she lived, and I 
came to this house, her home, with her. This is you.&quot; The twinkle to 
Mireille&#39;s eyes came back, and she pursed her red lips into a little wry 
smirk. &quot;Besides, life with me isn&#39;t so bad, is it?&quot; she said a touch 
impishly.

Kirika&#39;s eyes stung with tears and her sight became hazy, but she was 
smiling. How could she forget? She had been so mired in the things she 
had lost in Japan that she had overlooked the things she had gained 
here. The companion she had gained. The friendship she had gained. The 
love she had gained. The single person whose coming into her existence 
made up for everything that Kirika&#39;s life had lacked. Mireille.

The plagues of loneliness and meaninglessness were gone forever. They 
were truly ghosts, dead and buried. They could haunt Kirika no more now 
that she had Mireille. She had nothing to fear from them, or from their 
memories. She still hoped for an ordinary life, the spectres that craved 
peace still calling, but Mireille would soothe her wishful heart and 
soul and quiet the moans until that life was realised. Kirika&#39;s former 
home wasn&#39;t a house of broken dreams. It was a house of an earnest dream 
fulfilled; of a fervent prayer answered. It was here that her 
partnership with Mireille had been moulded and set in unbreakable stone. 
That fact made this house not a locale to shrink from but to be adored 
and revered. Kirika understood now. The reverence; it had been because 
of that first and foremost. Because this was where she and Mireille and 
joined as one. It was a hallowed site more sacred than any of Soldats or 
Noir lore.

Mireille held her closer, and Kirika breathed in her perfume deeply. 
&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to sleep in separate rooms?&quot; the blonde 
teased again.

&quot;Mm!&quot; Kirika hummed enthusiastically, nodding her head in a manner that 
left no doubt to her preference. She delicately cupped her hands around 
her student card that Mireille still dangled before her, taking it from 
her partner and then clenching it tight to her chest. She was Kirika 
Yuumura. And she was not alone.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I hope I got the general layout of the bottom floor of Kirika&#39;s old 
house and her bedroom right.

Genkan = The foyer bit at the entrance of a house where you remove and 
leave your shoes in favour of slippers.

Kotatsu = A low table, with built in electric heater and blanket. I know 
the one in Kirika&#39;s house wasn&#39;t exactly like that as far as you can 
tell, but for the life of me I couldn&#39;t remember what that kind of table 
was called other than kotatsu or &#39;low table&#39;. -_- Kotatsu is close 
enough!

Tatami mats = Mats primarily made of straw. Used for carpeting.</pre>
