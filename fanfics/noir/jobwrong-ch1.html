<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 1 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Just a little humorous Blurb, I dreamt up. If I get enough reviews 
I&#39;ll carry it on. But I&#39;ll be updating in conjuncture with &quot;Children of 
the Night&quot;. So it&#39;ll be slow, like a chapter a week. Review if you want 
me to continue!!!

How it all began.

	Fate it seems, has a cruel sense of humour. Either that, or a very 
perverse one. People can go there whole lives without knowing this. 
Indeed Eons have passed in tranquillity within the cosmos, and all have 
known peace. Until now.

	In a dark, dark alley in a dark, dark town in a very French 
country were two young women. Happily enjoying the nights 
assassinations. Blissfully unaware of the presence of a being so lacking 
in compassion, that he would happily laugh at others misfortune. One so 
evil, he would play the dirtiest of tricks. They were being watched by 
the author! And the author.... was bored....


	Kirika looked around for what felt like the umpteenth time, still 
finding no one. She was sure. She had felt so .. watched. As if... a 
being, so lacking in compassion, had been laughing at her. She turned to 
look at Mireille. The tall blonde Corsican beauty was inspecting the 
warehouse ahead of them. Luckily unaware of Kirika&#39;s strange behaviour. 
After all, Kirika didn&#39;t want to look a fool in front of her partner. 

	&quot;You ready?&quot; The blonde asked, her voice calm and still in the 
cool night air. Kirika felt like voicing her doubts. But ... it was just 
her fears. This would be an easy job, what could possibly go wrong? She 
nodded her head.  &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;


	Mireille didn&#39;t move as another bullet whizzed past her face. 
Instead she poked her Walther around the corner and opened fire on where 
she knew the man to be. There was a cry of pain and a crash as he fell 
across some barrels, knocking the slippery contents over the floor. 
Jumping from cover Mireille covered the man with her gun as she checked 
him. He was dead. The green liquid on the floor was running down a 
drain, turning red with the man&#39;s blood. 

	She knew this was some kind of illegal pharmacy get up. And that 
they had stumbled across some new discovery. A discovery that her client 
would prefer remained undiscovered. But that was hardly important. 

	Reloading her Walther P99, Mireille ran back into the main 
production area of the warehouse. There were only two men left now. In 
truth there had been few to begin with. This was a low-scale 
organisation that had just started up. A quick and simple job for Noir.  
Sighting Kirika running across a steel causeway suspended above some 
vats of fluids Mireille searched for any threats. The girl had things 
covered it seemed. 

	One man fell, a bullet hitting him in the head, he stumbled over 
the rail and smashed into the concrete floor with a wet thud. The other 
man turned to run but was cut down. Mireille gave her the thumbs up.

	&quot;All taken care of?&quot; She shouted up to the small Asian girl. 
Kirika smiled and nodded in reply. &quot;Good then let&#39;s-&quot; She stopped as a 
loud groaning sound emanated around the warehouse. Like the tortured 
moans of a thousand souls. Or then again it could have been from the 
metal causeway which had taken too much punishment. 

	&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille cried out in warning. As the metal bridge began 
to flex. The small girl tried to hold on but let out a loud brief shriek 
of surprise as she slipped over the rail. Falling straight into a huge 
vat of the special medicine. There was a loud splash and the cry cut 
off.

	&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille cried again, dropping her gun and charging up 
the metal steps hugging the side of the vat. She reached the top and 
searched for the shape of her friend in the murky green liquid. &quot;Kirika, 
come on.&quot; She urged, still looking. A shape emerged, a dark shadow under 
the liquid. Mireille gasped in relief as Kirika broke the surface in a 
spray of green goo. Coughing and hacking madly. 

	Mireille used a nearby pole to pull Kirika towards her, letting 
the girl grab hold of it as she kept coughing. Mireille threw the metal 
bar away as Kirika reached the side and was able to hold herself afloat. 
Kneeling down Mireille dragged her out of the vat and sat her on the 
metal balcony surrounding it. She coughed a bit more, and spat out as 
much of the stuff as she could.

	&quot;Come on we&#39;re going.&quot; Mireille urged, helping the woozy girl to 
her feet. Kirika looked pale and sick. Her face a pasty green and her 
mouth set in a deep frown. &quot;You&#39;ll feel better when we get back to the 
apartment.&quot; She reassured, reminding herself that she would have to send 
an e-mail to their client requesting to know what the drug did. All 
medicine was dangerous when taken in the quantities Kirika had just 
swallowed.

	Kirika nodded and leaned heavily on Mireille&#39; shoulder as they 
left the warehouse. Neither turning back as it exploded in a cloud of 
smoke and rubble. 


	And far away, locked in a small cramped room in a caravan. The 
author smiled. It was just beginning! Heh-heh-heh.


	Sorry about this not being so humour orientated, but it was the 
first chapter and I can never write good intros. It had to be serious to 
set the scene. But the next chapters should be funnier.
