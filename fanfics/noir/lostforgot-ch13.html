<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The following day Kirika&#39;s mood did not see improvement. The sky outside 
the ancient confines of the Manor was dark and filled with threatening, 
swirling storm clouds. Kirika pulled on her jacket slowly as she looked 
around the room she&#39;d been assigned what seemed like ages ago. She was 
never entirely at home in this room yet she couldn&#39;t deny that she had 
felt just a bit more at home in this strange bedroom than in Mireille 
Bouquet&#39;s residence. The ancient and graceful drapings and furnishings 
gave the room a dark, almost forboding feel that Kirika was surprised to 
find comforted her somehow. It was preferred, she supposed, to the open 
and sunlit loft which she had shared with Mireille. The loft she was to 
return to in a matter of days.

She sullenly trudged down the stairs and into the dining hall where, as 
per usual, Althena sat awaiting her guests. Chloe was also there, 
looking nearly as downtrodden as Kirika.

Mireille turned, a hint of a smile on her face, toward Kirika as the 
girl entered, &quot;Good news, we&#39;re going home!&quot;

Kirika&#39;s heart sunk a bit as she pulled her chair out and sat down, 
&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say! I can&#39;t wait to get out of here,&quot; she said, then quickly 
turned to Althena, though it was obvious she forced her praise, &quot;Not 
that it hasn&#39;t been just lovely staying here.&quot;

Responding to the mock praise with a mere nod and slight smile Althena 
informed Kirika of the situation, &quot;I have discovered where the increased 
hostility towards Noir has come from. As I had suspected it is from a 
small radical faction within the Soldats. If the leader of this faction 
were to meet with some misfortune,&quot; Althena glanced to Chloe shortly, &quot;I 
feel that the organization would crumble,&quot; she paused to allow Kirika to 
respond but as she was met with merely long silence she continued, &quot;As 
fate would have it the leader of this faction, a Simon Delacroix, is 
currently very nearby. It should be no trouble to find him within the 
day,&quot; she turned as Chloe sighed audibly, more accusing than 
questioning, &quot;You disapprove?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Chloe shook her head a bit defensively, &quot;Never. It&#39;s 
just that . . .&quot; As she trailed off the room fell to silence once more.

After several moments of rather awkward silence Mireille stood up and 
turned to Kirika, &quot;Kirika, I need to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; The younger girl seemed drawn out of her thoughts as she stood up, 
turning to Althena, &quot;Excuse me.&quot; She followed Mireille into a study a 
few rooms away from the dining hall, &quot;Mireille?&quot;

&quot;Kirika,&quot; Mirelle wore a uncharacteristically shy smile as she turned 
back to the Japanese girl following in her wake, &quot;When we get back to 
Paris . . . there&#39;s something we have to talk about.&quot;

&quot;But . . . why not here?&quot; Kirika&#39;s confusion was apparent.

&quot;It just . . . can&#39;t be here,&quot; Mireille smiled, shurgging off her odd 
shyness as she guestured around the dark study they stood in, &quot;I mean, 
look at this place, it&#39;s weird. Can you even imagine why someone would 
want to live in a place like this? No wonder Chloe&#39;s so . . . well, 
weird. I can&#39;t wait till we&#39;re back in Paris. They rennovated the 
apartment, it should be even nicer than it was before the fire. Thank 
god for insurance, that&#39;s all I can say,&quot; Mireille&#39;s words came in a 
torrent as if she was trying to flood Kirika&#39;s mind with anything but 
thought of whatever she could have to say when the return to Paris.

Kirika fought to keep herself from informing Mireille that she was 
rather fond of the decor. There was no real need to risk anything that 
could cause anymosity between herself and Mireille. Mireille had been 
acting so strangely lately and in the bit of her mind that was not 
preoccupied with Chloe and regaining her memory Kirika was worried about 
her friend. She nodded and took her leave, opting for the solitude of 
the windswept grounds without the Manor.

The weather had not improved and the smell of rain was in the air. More 
than a slight breeze rippled it&#39;s way forcefully though the sprawling 
vineyard and Kirika shivered as she aimlessly wandered the ancient 
grounds. She chewed her lip thoughtfully, balling her fists in her 
jacket pockets. She knew that this was the place. This was where it 
would happen; where it would come back to her. As she scanned the estate 
before her her mind itched at the memories just out of reach. She 
couldn&#39;t leave this place, not with the one thing she desired most so 
close to her; yet she couldn&#39;t bring herself to disappoint Mireille, as 
she knew any attempt at an explanation would. She didn&#39;t entirely 
understand Mireille, less than ever lately, but felt somehow that 
Mireille felt responsible for Kirika&#39;s well being and Kirika was sure 
that any disagreement she voiced would hurt Mireille, a friend she did 
not want to lose.

Mireille sighed happily as she looked around the room she&#39;d been 
assigned, making sure she hadn&#39;t left any personal items in the room, 
Cause God knows I don&#39;t plan on coming back! she smiled wryly, And I 
doubt these people would be keen on posting anything back to me. Paris, 
Paris, Paris! Finally I can go home. What a great excuse to buy all new 
clothes and things. Perhaps the insurance will pay for it . . . Either 
way, I know I&#39;ll need a nice long vacation after this place. Perhaps 
Kirika would like to go to one of those spas. Perhaps I could even find 
a . . . romantic spot to go, she blushed despite herself and smiled, 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, Mireille,&quot; she asked herself aloud, 
half-laughing, I don&#39;t suppose Kirika&#39;d be very into that, anyways.

Satisfied she&#39;d gathered up all of her small collection of personal 
effects Mireille half-skipped down the stairs and into the foyer. Not 
sure exactly what they were going to do to find the man, Simon 
Delacroix, Mireille set off to find anyone, though admittedly she 
preferred Kirika to Chloe or Althena, who might be able to fill her in 
on the day&#39;s plan. After a limited time meandering the empty corridors 
she stumbled upon Althena in a side room writing some letter or other, 
Does she ever do anything but write letters?

The woman looked up as Mireille approached, smiling slightly, almost 
eerily. Mireille took note of the fact that the woman crossed her hand 
across the paper she&#39;d been writing on, hiding her work from view, 
&quot;You&#39;re ready to return to Paris?&quot;

&quot;Yes, now where&#39;s this guy Delacroix, the sooner this is over the 
better,&quot; Mireille responded pointedly. With the way home so obvious she 
didn&#39;t feel like wasting anymore time talking to Althena, preferring to 
get this man gone and get gone herself.

&quot;Chloe is preparing, I am fairly sure that Kirika is doing so as well, 
in her own way,&quot; Althena&#39;s eyes found the small window looking out on 
the grounds where a light sprinkle was beginning to fall and the thought 
that the words somehow held a second meaning occurred to Mireille, but 
the thought left her as soon as it came, &quot;The time approaches for you to 
leave here, though perhaps one day you will return.&quot;

Don&#39;t hold your breath, Mireille bit back a laugh.

Chloe was thankful for the light rain that patted down on her cloaked 
shoulders as the marched down the dirt road slightly ahead of Kirika 
Yuumura and Mireille Bouquet, it served well to hide the oh-so-rare 
tears that slowly crept down her cheeks. She was not partial to crying, 
usually able to keep her emotions under lockdown. Today was not such a 
day as she led the two other assassins away from the Manor, away from 
the home where Kirika was meant to be. When the job was done and Kirika 
went back to Paris with the Corsican only God knew when she would 
return, or even if she would. Althena assured Chloe that Kirika would 
one day return to the Manor but unless that one day was today this would 
remain a gloomy day for Chloe.

She looked down to the ground, not sure if it was rain or salty tears 
that dripped off of the tip of her nose and into the forming mud at her 
feet. The rain was light but the dirt stuck around the edges of her 
boots. Her small frame shivered slightly under the heavy green coat and 
she ran her hand through her hair, wringing out a few droplets of water. 
She smiled sadistically, not having to look back to know that the 
Daughter of Corsica was not exactly warm and toasty clad in her usual 
short skirt and sleeveless shirt. Chloe hoped that Kirika was warm 
enough, however, knowing that she wasn&#39;t as fortunately dressed as 
herself, Perhaps I should offer her my cloak . . . she smiled a bit, Her 
cloak. She turned around and let the girlish smile drop off her face as 
she looked at a rather miserable looking duo in her wake. She pulled off 
the heavy coat and held it out to Kirika, who looked up from her feet 
with a look of mild surprise on her face.

&quot;You look cold,&quot; Chloe explained plainly, barely loud enough to be heard 
over the rain.

Mireille scoffed a bit as Kirika took the cape gently, nodding, &quot;Thank 
you.&quot;

Smiling as Kirika draped it around her shoulders Chloe turned back to 
the road ahead, shivering moreso than before against the cold. If 
anything the small black outfit she wore was less protection against the 
rain than even Mireille Bouquet&#39;s skimpy attire. She continued marching 
through the thickening mud, jerkily walking along as her boots sank into 
the road every few steps. The rain was coming a fair bit harder and 
Chloe nearly regretted giving up her cloak. Nearly. She was thankful 
they were able to get as far as they did before the rain began to fall 
so heavily upon the trio. From the small town at the end of this road 
they would rendezvous with a contact who would provide transportation to 
a significantly large city no more than a days walk, though with the 
provided transportation it would no doubt cut down the time 
considerably. Though Chloe was glad for the reduced time in the rain it 
didn&#39;t make it any easier to think that when she returned down this 
muddy lane she would be alone.

She shook her head slightly, clearing her head and steeling herself for 
the task which lay ahead. As much as the thought of losing her other 
half once more bothered her, she would not lose this opportunity to 
prove that she was the True Noir. She would not fail.</pre>
