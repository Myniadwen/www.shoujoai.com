<h1>Lost But Not Forgotten, Forgotten But Not Lost (part 2 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/zelasm.html">Oo ZelasMetallium oO</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The Lady Luck was a trashy hotel that had once been the pride of the 
city in its prime. The years of wear and the outdated attractions had 
taken their toll however and the tired old hotel seemed desolate. &quot;Hmmm 
. . . this looks like the perfect place for a trap,&quot; Mireille observed 
icily as she and Kirika entered the abandoned hotel and started climbing 
the stairs. The two women reached their destination and knocked on the 
door, guns drawn.

&quot;Seventh hour . . . twelfth minute . . . you&#39;re late,&quot; Chloe pointed out 
as she stepped out of the room, &quot;I was about to leave.&quot;

&quot;There was traffic and we couldn&#39;t get a taxi,&quot; Kirika explained 
politely, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;No worries,&quot; Chloe smiled and an astonished Mireille was reminded of a 
child who&#39;s every wish had just come true. The mysterious assassin who 
Mireille had hated and to some point feared was now a giddy-looking girl 
who was smiling at . . . Kirika.

Why? Why does it make me so angry when she&#39;s around Kirika? Mireille 
thought, it&#39;s because she&#39;s dangerous. If something happens to Kirika 
then this pilgrimage to the past will end and I, I&#39;ll never know-- But 
it&#39;s not like she needs my protection. Then why am I so protective of 
her? It&#39;s not like I--

&quot;Mireille?&quot; Kirika asked, &quot;Mireille, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, nothing. I was just thinking,&quot; Mireille hadn&#39;t realized Kirika 
was trying to get her attention while she attempted to sort out her 
thoughts.

&quot;Follow me,&quot; Chloe beckoned from near the stairs, &quot;We have to leave 
now.&quot;

&quot;How much further are we going? Are you just planning on walking around 
until the Soldats get tired of searching?&quot; Mireille complained.

&quot;Not much further,&quot; Chloe called back.

Mireille grunted her displeasure. From the hotel they had jumped into a 
cargo car of a passing train and had ridden until dawn. They had 
abandoned the rail car finding themselves in a small town. Though 
Mireille had wished to rest at a local inn Chloe had insisted they press 
on. The noon sun now beat down on Mireille&#39;s shoulders as she walked 
alongside Kirika a good thirty feet behind Chloe so that she could keep 
a good eye on the mysterious assassin. They had been walking the same 
dirt road for hours and Mireille&#39;s energy was almost spent.

&quot;You are tired,&quot; Chloe pointed out, stopping and waiting for the two to 
catch up. She turned and faced Mireille, &quot;We can rest here.&quot;

&quot;You must be very hot in that,&quot; Kirika ventured as the three women sat 
at the edge of the road between a dry ditch and the field of a vineyard.

&quot;Hmm . . .&quot; Chloe nodded but showed no intention of taking off her cloak 
though sweat dripped off her hair and down her face. Kirika surmised 
that the cloak was even heavier than it looked.

&quot;I could carry it for you . . . it you want,&quot; she offered politely.

&quot;No. Thank you, though,&quot; Chloe smiled softly, &quot;This cape is very . . . 
very special to me.&quot;

&quot;Special enough to die of heat stroke for?&quot; Mireille scoffed.

Chloe did not her or did not choose to respond, &quot;It&#39;s almost noon. We 
should keep going if we expect to make it to lunch on time.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to want to tell us where we&#39;re going here in the 
middle of nowhere, would you?&quot; Mireille pressed as she dragged herself 
to her feet, &quot;I see nothing here but vineyards and dirt.&quot;

&quot;Just over that hill over there,&quot; Chloe cocked her head in the direction 
of a small knoll ahead, &quot;Not much farther.&quot;

As the trio arrived at the crest of the hill and looked down on their 
destination Mireille couldn&#39;t help but be perplexed. This? This is the 
place where we&#39;ll be safe from the Soldats? We came all the way for 
this? There&#39;s nothing here but a ruined old plantation house. She turned 
to Chloe, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s the big-- huh?&quot; Chloe was already halfway to the 
ruins as she ran pell-mell for the old building, her cloak billowing out 
behind her. Kirika had begun to follow her slowly down the hill and 
Mireille joined the young girl, &quot;I don&#39;t like this. That girl led us to 
ruins in the middle of nowhere. Why? There&#39;s another reason we were 
brought here, not just the Soldats. I can feel it; I just know what it 
is yet. Be on your guard.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but,&quot; Kirika began and paused, then finished, &quot;never mind.&quot;

&quot;What is it? Do you know something?&quot; Mireille pressed.

&quot;No, it&#39;s just . . .&quot; The younger woman seemed to struggle to choose the 
right words, &quot;There&#39;s something about her. She kills without compassion, 
but she seems like a child the very next minute. She&#39;s innocent in her 
heart. I don&#39;t think she wants to hurt us. That she brought us here for 
a reason other than protection I have no doubt, but I do not see malice 
in her eyes.&quot;

Mireille turned a cold look toward Kirika, &quot;You seem awfully perceptive 
all of a sudden. Pretty talkative, too. Is there something I should 
know?&quot; What am I saying? I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m thinking about. I 
just know that Kirika&#39;s changing. Everything&#39;s changing and it seems to 
be changing for the worse. When we started on this pilgrimage, things 
changed but she was always the same. Always quiet, always there. But now 
even Kirika is changing and it&#39;s all because of her. Why should that 
stranger have such an impact on that girl&#39;s &#39;shell&#39; when I have never 
had the slightest effect? Why do I care? Why does it bother me so much, 
dammit?!

&quot;Welcome home, my darling Chloe,&quot; a soft caring voice lifted Mireille 
from her thoughts. The three assassins stood in what was once the 
estate&#39;s courtyard facing a lovely, motherly looking woman who smiled 
back at them, &quot;I see that you have accomplished your task, seemingly 
without mishap,&quot; she turned toward Mireille and Kirika, &quot;I am glad that 
you both arrived safely. I am Althena. I am sure that you are very tired 
of your journey. Please follow me, I will take you to your rooms so that 
you may bathe and rest before lunch.&quot; And with that she turned and 
headed towards the ruined manor. As she opened the door Mireille was 
surprised to see that what looked like a derelict shamble on the outside 
as actually a spacious, well kept, though sparsely furnished house and 
the chandeliers and grand staircase make it worthy of the name manor. 
Althena led them silently up the staircase and into a small back hall. 
&quot;Miss Bouquet, correct?&quot; Althena turned her head toward Mireille and 
when she nodded continued, opening the first door to her left, &quot;This 
will be your room, and Kirika, you will stay here,&quot; she opened the door 
across the hall, &quot;For the time being.&quot; Taking note of the every oddity, 
it irked Mireille that this woman believed she was on a first name basis 
with Kirika. For the time being? What was that supposed to mean?

This is really rubbing me the wrong way, Mireille thought, I do not like 
being in the dark and I can tell that this Althena knows something she&#39;s 
not telling us. And what part does she play in this? How does she know 
Chloe?

&quot;On account of your late arrival lunch will be delayed today. Chloe will 
show you down in two hours,&quot; Althena informed them, &quot;Until them please 
rest and make yourselves at home. If your bathwater is cold please call 
for Chloe,&quot; she turned and walked back down the stairs leaving the three 
younger women in the hall.

&quot;I will see you in two hours then,&quot; Chloe smiled and retreated into the 
second room on the right before Mireille could grill her with questions. 
Mireille turned to her partner who shrugged and walked into her 
designated room.

The room was much larger and more luxurious that the room she had shared 
with Mireille in Paris and Kirika felt so small spread out on the large 
four-poster bed with velvet hangings and silk sheets. I wish I could 
live in a place like this, Kirika thought dreamily, I wish I could take 
long baths like that one and sleep in this huge bed. I wonder if 
Mireille would consider moving to a big house now that ours has burned 
down. I hope Mireille is alright. She seems so mad lately. She&#39;s mad at 
Chloe. Why? Did Chloe do something to her? I know that she&#39;s far from 
above suspicion, but she knows about Noir and the Soldats, so she could 
probably tell us a lot, and she did save us from the Soldats. I won&#39;t 
say I trust her, but there&#39;s just something about her . . .

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kirika called in response to the light tap on her door.

&quot;You can come down for lunch now,&quot; Chloe called from the other side of 
the door.

Kirika reluctantly rose from the comfort of the bed and stepped into the 
hall. A rather disgruntled-looking Mireille stared her down and judging 
by Mireille&#39;s still dirty, sweat-streaked face and clothes Kirika 
surmised that her partner had thought it safer not to bathe and probably 
thought it imprudent that Kirika had. Kirika turned her gaze to Chloe 
who had obviously taken to opportunity to bathe. Her magenta hair clung 
in wet strands to the side of her face and the assassin had shed her 
long cloak revealing a skin-tight black outfit most would consider 
skimpy. Seeing her figure unshielded by the cloak Kirika was surprised 
to see how frail and small she actually seemed. It also occurred to 
Kirika that Chloe was actually very young, perhaps even younger than 
herself.

Mireille seemed to have been struck by the same thought as she 
sarcastically asked, &quot;Just how old are you?&quot;

&quot;As old as my bones and a little older that my teeth,&quot; Chloe retorted 
quickly, then turned and started toward the staircase, &quot;Follow me, 
please. Althena will be waiting for us.&quot;

Looking rather put out Mireille followed her with Kirika in tow. From 
the entrance to the Manor they moved through a study on the first floor 
into a small but elegant dining hall. Four chairs sat around a large oak 
table, one of which was occupied by Althena who sat patiently awaiting 
the younger women.

I&#39;ve never seen so much food! Kirika thought as she gazed at the 
food-laden table. There was everything she could ever want to eat. Yes, 
I definitely want to live like this.

&quot;Please, have a seat,&quot; Althena beckoned to the two empty seats as Chloe 
sat to her left. Kirika claimed the seat to Althena&#39;s right and Mireille 
sat across from the older woman.

&quot;Miss Bouquet, was there a problem with your bath water?&quot; Althena 
inquired politely after a generic prayer was said and the meal began, &quot;I 
heated it before you arrived, I hope it wasn&#39;t too cold.&quot;

&quot;Mine was lovely,&quot; Kirika smiled.

&quot;I didn&#39;t feel like bathing,&quot; Mireille grumbled.

&quot;You heated the water? Do you not having running water?&quot; Kirika asked, 
trying to think back on her bath. Come to think of it, there wasn&#39;t a 
tap.

&quot;No, we don&#39;t. There is no electricity or running water here, either. I 
hope it is not too much of an inconvenience for you. I have found that 
an absence of basic convenience fosters perseverance. I am glad that you 
enjoyed your bath. It&#39;s not often that we use the bath tubs; it is such 
a hassle to carry in and heat the water.&quot;

&quot;Why did you bring us all the way out here? How did you know the Soldats 
were after us?&quot; Mireille pressed Althena.

&quot;I sent Chloe to get you because you were in danger. I have friends in 
the Soldats who warned me that Noir would soon come under fire, so to 
speak,&quot; Althena smiled a bit, &quot;Why they would target you now I do not 
know,&quot; she explained, &quot;You are here because this is the safest place for 
you to be. Under my watch the Soldats have never struck here.&quot;

&quot;Why would they strike here if we weren&#39;t here?&quot; Mireille retorted, 
&quot;We&#39;re their prime target so they will come now! We&#39;re just bait for 
them, what makes you think you can stop them?&quot; Mireille raved. Was this 
woman dense?

&quot;You can trust Althena,&quot; Chloe pointed out as though trusting this 
mysterious and rather bizarre woman was the most natural thing in the 
world.

&quot;Maybe you don&#39;t understand who the Soldats are,&quot; Mireille said stonily, 
&quot;If they wish us dead you won&#39;t be able to stop them. I highly doubt 
they are frightened of a senile woman who seems fresh out of the local 
convent, or of a little girl with a few throwing knives.&quot;

Chloe let out a sort of snarl and began to stand, grabbing a butter 
knife near her plate, ready to take her and Althena&#39;s defense before the 
older woman&#39;s hand on her shoulder bade her to sit back down.

&quot;Though I hope you will stay, you are welcome to leave at any time you 
wish. There is no doubt in my mind that you will receive the greatest 
protection here, but if you wish to leave you know the way back to 
town,&quot; Althena stood up and started toward the door opposite the one 
they had come in, &quot;Now if you will excuse me I have a letter to write. 
Chloe, I will be with you when I have finished.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Chloe smiled.</pre>
