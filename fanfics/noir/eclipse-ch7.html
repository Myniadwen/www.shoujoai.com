<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Mireille wipes my face again with the washcloth. &quot;Here. Try to drink 
this.&quot; She holds a cup of tea to my lips. &quot;The doctor said you can have 
it.&quot;

I take a small sip, glad that my mouth seems to be working again. I try 
to squeeze her hand, but barely have the strength to do so.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s going to be okay.&quot; She wipes my mouth as she speaks. 
She glances sideways at Uncle, talking to the doctor, and several 
Soldats. Her eyes narrow. &quot;We don&#39;t need all of them here.&quot; she mutters 
angrily under her breath.

The doctor comes back over to me, shines his penlight in my eyes one 
more time, and smiles.

&quot;You&#39;ll be much better by morning.&quot; He turns and shakes Uncle&#39;s hand. 
&quot;Call me if you need anything.&quot;

&quot;And as always, I thank you for your services.&quot; Uncle replies. He 
motions to the two men standing silently by the door. &quot;Henry, stay right 
inside the front door. Marchaud, escort the doctor to his car and get an 
update from the street unit.&quot;

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Mireille sits the teacup on the 
nightstand and gets up, facing him.

&quot;Protecting you.&quot; he answers absently, clicking something on his cell 
phone.

&quot;We don&#39;t need your help. We don&#39;t need anything from Soldats.&quot; she 
snaps out, putting her hands on her hips.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; I say her name softly, and she snorts angrily, but says 
nothing further.

Uncle sighs heavily, and walks down to the foot of the bed. &quot;May I?&quot; he 
nods his head at me. &quot;My knee is ready to give out.&quot;

I nod my head back at him, and he sits down, leaning his cane against 
his knee.

&quot;Now then, Kirika. If you&#39;re up to it, I want to hear what happened.&quot;

I nod my head. Mireille frowns.

&quot;Just what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; she glares at him. She stands 
closer to me and takes my hand, as if she&#39;s guarding me from him. &quot;I 
told you, we can handle this.&quot;

&quot;It is truly amazing.&quot; He snaps his phone shut and puts it back in his 
jacket. &quot;But I believe you are more stubborn than your father, Mireille 
Bouquet.&quot; He reaches into another pocket and pulls out a pen and 
notepad. He raises his head and meets her gaze solemnly with his own.

&quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t bring you the same fate.&quot;</pre>
