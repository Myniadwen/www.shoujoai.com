as we sit in the back of the limo. &quot;He outsmarted Soldats on this 
round.&quot;

Insurance. That&#39;s what Uncle called it. To find the book, we need Droger 
and his group alive.

&quot;He&#39;s virtually assured himself a trouble-free release from prison.&quot; She 
twirls her hair in thought. &quot;I always wondered what was in that book- 
did you read any of it?&quot;

&quot;A little.&quot; I nod my head. &quot;It&#39;s very old and fragile.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; she urges me, and I wrinkle my brow, trying to 
remember.

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Uncle interrupts us. The doors open and I can smell the 
remnants of the fire. I cough a few times, as does Mireille. I look back 
and realize we&#39;ve driven through some sort of old iron gate, which is 
now closed again by a policeman.

&quot;Wait here.&quot; Uncle waves his hand at us, as several men approach him.

&quot;Executor of the estate. I spoke to you this morning.&quot; He greets the 
men, and hands them a card. &quot;My associates and I would like to take a 
look around.&quot;

&quot;Be careful where you go. We&#39;ve marked off some sections with tape- make 
sure you don&#39;t disturb those areas.&quot; A man with a blue cap and a badge 
on his chest waves his arm toward the buildings. &quot;In fact, I&#39;ll go with 
you.&quot;

I look over at the two buildings, one a badly burned new building 
adjoined to an old stone building. I stare at the old building.

&quot;Mireille.&quot; I whisper to her as we all walk forward.

&quot;What is it?&quot; she falls into step with me.

&quot;I&#39;ve been here before.&quot;

----------

&quot;And as you can see, the fire started from here and spread. It&#39;s an 
obvious case of arson. Do you have any idea of someone who would do such 
a thing?&quot; the man in the blue cap, Georges, looks over at Uncle.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I really don&#39;t.&quot; Uncle answers quietly. We stand in the 
older part of the building. Uncle looks around at the walls, and at the 
glass display case that once held the book.

&quot;I understand thieves, but why set the place on fire once they had what 
they wanted?&quot; Georges muses out loud. &quot;It&#39;s very odd.&quot;

&quot;It certainly is.&quot; Uncle nods his head, and takes out his notebook. &quot;If 
you don&#39;t mind, I need to make some notes.&quot;

&quot;Not at all. I hope you have adequate insurance on the paintings and 
books that were taken. We will keep an eye out for anything popping up 
on the black market.&quot;

&quot;I thank you for your help.&quot; Uncle nods his head. &quot;You said there was 
one survivor?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Frere Mueller is at the hospital. He&#39;s been badly burned and in 
the intensive care unit. I&#39;m not sure he&#39;ll make it, from what I hear.&quot; 
Georges sighs. &quot;We&#39;ve tried talking to him, but he doesn&#39;t know 
anything.&quot;

I walk away from them, studying the room. It seems familiar. I feel 
Mireille come up behind me.

&quot;So when were you here?&quot; her voice is low, meant only for me.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I wrinkle my brow. &quot;But I know that if you go out of 
this room, there&#39;s a stairway to the left.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s look then.&quot; She touches my arm.

&quot;We&#39;re going to look around a bit more, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; She 
announces out loud. Uncle looks up from his conversation with Georges 
and nods his head. We walk through the old archway and into a smaller 
room. I catch my breath as I see the old steps winding upward.

&quot;It&#39;s here.&quot; Mireille sounds shocked. &quot;It&#39;s really here.&quot; She steps 
forward and takes my hand, looking down at me.

&quot;Do you want to go up there...&quot; she hesitates. &quot;What if- that room is up 
there.&quot;

We look at each other for a moment. She purses her lips, then nods her 
head at me.

&quot;But you have to go, don&#39;t you?&quot; she says softly.

I pull her hand and we start up the steps together.</pre>
