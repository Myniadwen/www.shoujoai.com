<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The guard opens the door and we go in. Due to visitor limitations, Henry 
has been asked to wait in the receiving room.

&quot;He&#39;s got one guest already.&quot; The guard explains. &quot;Well, two, if you 
count the dog.&quot;

We all look at one another, and Uncle smiles as if we&#39;ve won a prize. 
But as we file through the door, I don&#39;t feel jubilant at all. I feel 
very nervous and uneasy.

The room we enter is large, with the cell taking up half the room. It&#39;s 
poorly lit, with only one window for the sun to shine through. A chair 
sits near the cell. The woman from the park sits in it; I catch my 
breath quickly and grab Mireille&#39;s hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; she hisses at me, disengaging herself. &quot;Not here, Kirika.&quot;

I feel a small surge of anger, which serves to help with the fear I&#39;m 
feeling. I drop back and walk behind her, trying to imitate her calm 
demeanor.

&quot;Ah, my guests have arrived.&quot; A rich voice calls out from the cell. The 
man behind the bars gets up from the bed and walks forward, putting his 
face up to the bars. He wears a dark red robe that shines softly in the 
semi-darkness of the room. I remember what Mireille said about him being 
called the Fallen Emperor. With his proud face and thick long brown hair 
curling down to his shoulders, he looks the part. He is younger than 
Uncle; for some reason I thought they would be the same age.

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment.&quot; He looks at all of us. &quot;Waiting for 
almost twenty years.&quot; He nods his head towards Uncle.

&quot;Not that I&#39;ve been idle all this time; indeed, during my exile, I&#39;ve 
built a truly immense financial empire, more than I could have ever 
imagined in my youth. And I&#39;m looking forward to the rewards of my 
efforts.&quot; He smiles pleasantly at us. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to a lot of 
things upon my release.&quot;

&quot;About the letter you wrote-&quot; Uncle goes to pull out the letter, but 
Droger interrupts him.

&quot;I see you have a problem with your knee. Tierney, give the old man your 
chair.&quot; He orders the woman, and she stands and waves her hand at Uncle 
in invitation.

&quot;No thanks.&quot; Uncle says. &quot;I&#39;ll stand.&quot;

&quot;Pride...it&#39;s a funny thing.&quot; Droger remarks, his eyes moving over to 
Mireille. &quot;It makes people do all sorts of things, even if it&#39;s not in 
their best interest.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Mireille turns her head to one side as 
if she&#39;s analyzing him. They stare at one another and for some reason, I 
become even more uneasy.

&quot;I knew your father quite well. He had built quite an empire himself.&quot; 
He looks at Mireille intently, and she arches one eyebrow.

&quot;And now- to see you standing before me like this.... my, how far you&#39;ve 
fallen.&quot; his tone takes on an air of disappointment.

Mireille&#39;s eyes widen in surprise, then I see a dark look cross her 
face.

&quot;Tell me, just how does it feel to be this low and common?&quot; he taunts 
her.

Mireille charges forward, but Teirney jumps up and blocks the cell.

&quot;Your only way forward is through me.&quot; Teirney&#39;s face is just as fierce 
as Mireille&#39;s and their eyes are locked inches apart.

&quot;Mireille.&quot; Uncle&#39;s voice has a warning tone, but she ignores him. I see 
her hand tighten into a fist.

&quot;Mireille, please!&quot; I cry out. She backs up slightly, never taking her 
eyes from Tierney&#39;s face.

&quot;We&#39;ll meet again.&quot; Mireille growls at her.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m counting on it.&quot; Tierney retorts back, a smug smile forming on 
her lips.

Uncle steps in and pulls Mireille further back. &quot;I think we need to have 
a small discussion. If you will excuse us for a few moments.&quot; He takes 
Mireille&#39;s arm. She glances at me and I nod my head for her to go.

&quot;If any harm comes to her, you will personally answer to me!&quot; Mireille 
snaps out.

&quot;I would expect nothing less of you.&quot; Tierney answers.

&quot;Nor I.&quot; Droger answers smoothly, seemingly unruffled by the last few 
minutes.

&quot;Mireille, come with me please.&quot; Uncle&#39;s voice indicates he won&#39;t take 
no for an answer, and Mireille gives an angry huff as she is led from 
the room.

&quot;Her bloodlines come through quite well. Impressive performance.&quot; Droger 
rubs his hands together as if he&#39;s enjoyed himself.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just as impressive in bed.&quot; Tierney&#39;s sarcastic voice 
matches the nasty look on her face.

&quot;Tierney!&quot; he thunders so loud that we both jump. She turns to face him, 
eyes wide.

&quot;Go walk the dog. Now.&quot;

She shoots me another nasty look, then reaches under the chair and grabs 
Scruffy. He seems undeterred from the events in the room and dances 
happily about as she leashes him.

&quot;And apologize before you leave.&quot; he commands from his cell. Her mouth 
drops open.

&quot;My...apologies for that last remark, my lady.&quot; Her lip curls in obvious 
dislike of her task. She walks to the door, giving me one last look.

&quot;Enjoy your time together.&quot; she sneers, and slams the door behind her.</pre>
