Unreal.

There was simply no other word that was fitting, or could describe her 
situation better. Mireille fought back the small urge to twirl her long, 
golden hair around her index finger, a small habit of discomfort she had 
picked up during her sweet, but short childhood on the Corsican island. 
A habit that had been drilled out by her stepmother&#39;s gentle, yet strict 
hands later when she had arrived in France, led by kin, or a friend to 
her real parents.

She could clearly recall the woman&#39;s face, her tired, but strong profile 
that had really been nothing like Mireille&#39;s own. Rich brown hair, 
sharply shortened at her shoulders framing a face that carried the 
wrinkles of grief, eroded to softness by time like her no doubt once 
vibrant spirit. She harboured no love for the woman. Not out of spite or 
maltreatment but simply because it didn&#39;t fit with the image she had 
formed during the years in the house.

It had been a few brief years, years that had consisted more of 
schooling and training than play and joy. Still, with no clear memories 
of her biological parents or whereas their fates had been, the years 
spent on the French countryside were a few of the peaceful and memorable 
ones in her life. Her &#39;Mama&#39; had not been a kind woman, neither was she 
mean or bad in any other way Mireille could have named at that age. She 
was a teacher, an instructor; she had fed, clothed and schooled her. 
That had been her duty and purpose and there were simply no more or less 
to it. There had been very little love, but certainly no displeasure at 
the young Mireille&#39;s presence.

When she had arrived at the small house, with its apple trees and 
vineyard, well overgrown by blooming cling-plants and cats, she had been 
lost. No matter how hard she tried, she could simply not remember how or 
why she had gotten there. The memories had become blurred and paled with 
time, the smells and impressions no longer as vivid as once; still, she 
knew there had been a hand, a steady, warm grip around her own smaller 
one. There had been no pain, or indication to that she was unwished for, 
hurt or anything unpleasant. There was only the iron grip, of 
determination and natural strength, as she was led towards her new home, 
where she would come to spend most of her early childhood.

Mireille, despite her present occupation, could still recall how she had 
been then; something of a lost kitten, far too inexperienced and young, 
stumbling around on her unsteady feet. Making mistakes became something 
of a daily routine where Mama would reprimand her, often with a stiff 
remark, followed with a gentler nod when she corrected herself. In her 
memories, the woman had with endless patience taught and bore with her, 
taking in the curious, but fragile child she had been into her home 
without a word of protest.

But still, with little or no love at all.

Until a blonde, kind-looking man, who introduced himself as her uncle - 
her real maternal relative - had one day showed up at the heavy wooden 
door, and yet again led her away by hand, to never return to the house 
which she forever would relate to as her first home.

Now, with a feeling of d&#130;j&#133; vu, she found herself going through the same 
ordeal that probably had been her stepmother&#39;s feat so many years ago. 
Watching her new found &#39;roommate&#39;, she could only stare, if not laugh at 
how the girl before her was trying to dry off the dishes. She chose to 
hide her amusement however, while she did not know much about vampires, 
she preferred not to do anything that could provoke one.

With the wash cloth in one hand, the Asian girl handled her cheap, 
bazaarpurchased plates like if they were the finest china, drying each 
and one of them off carefully inch by inch before putting them down 
beside the sink. While the concept of having a monster in her home, or 
even one drying her dishes for her, would have seemed as alien as a Mars 
invasion a few weeks ago. The blonde had to acknowledge that both of 
them as promised, had settled into a routine where the vampire girl 
helped her on various tasks throughout the days while she was trying to 
track any trails relating to the pocket watch.

But first, the routine of everyday life had to be learned, which had 
been a completely foreign thing to Kirika. It was to the blonde&#39;s 
amusement, but also distress over the number of broken things.

While Mireille was pouring every notch of her contact net into tracking 
down every skilled craftsman in Paris that could name or know about the 
mysterious watch that had saved her from certain doom. Kirika, as the 
blonde now called her by name, spent most of her time in the apartment 
on things far too trivial for what one would expect from a vampire, 
sitting by the window for hours at end. It had taken a few days before 
the blonde realized, with a flicker of guilt, why.

She had returned from a meeting with one of her informants one evening 
to find the girl lying across her floor, her hands more or less clutched 
into claws as she had let out one series after another of dreadful 
coughs. Her usual pale face almost reduced to bloodless as she had been 
soaked through with sweat, shivering and shaking as if she had been laid 
out to die in a snowstorm rather than a warm autumn afternoon in France. 
Her breaths had been a rasping sound like sand hammering against metal, 
the deep, reddish brown eyes thinned into slits, flicking back and forth 
in something that could only be unbearable pain. It didn&#39;t take much 
time for the blondeto figure out what the cause was.

She had tried to remove the watch.

While being grateful for having the solid protection against Kirika, she 
could do nothing but feel guilty about the horrors it caused her. It was 
certainly not pleasant to watch, but it was her only insurance, a 
feeling which they both loathed but understood.

Kirika&#39;s expression had been as neutral as ever while Mireille had 
helped her up and more or less made her more presentable than the 
pitiful state she had been found in. The blonde could not help but feel 
the boding of dread run down her spine as the reddish gaze had landed on 
her, and she was sure, that had the watch been gone that instant, she 
would have been the one lying on the floor, with an outcome far more 
deadly than the vampire&#39;s.

But still, despite all the likeness of a child learning the world, 
despite mistakes that sometimes threatened to become cute, she could not 
- and would not - deny what went, ate and slept in her once impenetrable 
sanctuary.

Kirika&#39;s nature and usefulness were to be respected, if she wanted to 
see this through with her life intact. The ally she had sought was an 
indeed a powerful one, but it was power borrowed and not to be taken for 
granted. The dark-haired girl&#39;s original mission in being in her home 
was not to be forgotten.

Making a pact with her was taking a risk so big that normally, Mireille 
wouldn&#39;t have given it a thought, much less a promise. A promise, and a 
verbal one of all things, between a killer and a monster. No fool, or 
even the most low-headed syndicate goon would probably have honoured it, 
but she had to. The deal had more or less been set at the same time as 
Kirika had entered her home, or when she had fired the first bullet.

The other possible scenario would be letting the girl go, removing the 
watch and merely hoping that the vampire wouldn&#39;t attempt another 
nightly visit, which was as reassuring as anything close to her 
profession. Of course, there had been a point in allying with the girl, 
with her existence sitting by her window as the proof, she couldn&#39;t deny 
the possibility that there were more of them. And seeing how the girl 
had fought, her company would be more than an unnerving comfort, but a 
lifeguard if the situation should arise.

The puzzle of the pocket watch had been no lie, and she buried herself 
in the starting phase of the task with her usual fervour regarding work. 
Even if the end of the matter was much lesser, or nothing but a real 
coincidence played by fate, she would at least have had time to observe 
the girl, who may potentially be the most dangerous foe she had ever 
made.

If Kirika turned against her, she would have the watch, and its 
mysterious power over the girl. If she did not, and remained until the 
end of their promise, she would hopefully have gained valuable 
information on how to fight, and maybe kill her.

It was a risky game. The bets on her side were far too high for her 
usual taste, but really, she didn&#39;t have a choice. Whatever she had 
started, she would have to finish.

CRASH

...given that they would ever be finished with the dishes of course.

Mireille discarded the shards of another plate into her dustbin as the 
dark-haired girl beside her watched with a face that was more curious 
than guilty. Honestly, the blonde couldn&#39;t really see what was so 
fascinating at all since this was, since the first day, the sixth plate 
that had suffered at the vampire&#39;s hand. She sometimes wondered what it 
was that brewed behind those expressionless eyes when they looked at 
her, but then, what use was there guessing?

With a small sigh, she stood up and returned to her computer, avoiding 
the uneasy eye contact with a shrug of her mind, going back to her 
detective work as she had been every evening for this week. Kirika did 
not linger for long in the kitchen as she made her way towards her now 
traditional place beside the window, her pace and motion still showing 
light signs of subtle restraints. From what the blonde understood, 
sudden movements like running or even a twist of arm could be painful 
for the dark-haired girl, not to mention actually touching the silvery 
metal through physical contact. That was all she had gained from 
observation. The two of them rarely talked, and when they did it was all 
in clipped remarks or one-word replies that were as telling as a 
monologue.

She did not know how the watch worked, why it worked or even had a clue 
about why her family crest was engraved on it. Bouquet&#39;s signet, the 
lynx, which once had ruled Corsica, was boldly engraved on the inside of 
the lid; it&#39;s sharp, feline profile staring back at its last successor 
with accusing eyes.

Having been brought up by stepparents, and handed over to a real 
relative at the brittle age of ten made the young assassin feel little 
pride and devotion however. To her, the insignia of the wildcat was only 
what it appeared to be, a dead relic of her lost family. She could feel 
no surge of anger, or call for vendetta upon its sight. Some would have 
called her a failure as a Corsican, a surviving princess of a once proud 
clan, bearing no vengeance or wish for retribution whatsoever.

The loss of her parents had come early, she could be sure of that much. 
Sometimes, at the shift between morning and dawn, at the verge between 
dreams and wakefulness, sometimes, she could almost remember something. 
A fragrance of lilacs and olives, the brush of a rueful smile against 
her sleeping face, her own laughter, and a salty breeze; those were all 
she could recall, all there was left to relate to her parents.

She had no memory of the existence of such a watch within her family, 
but then, for someone who could not even remember their faces, it came 
as no surprise. But despite being orphaned for reasons both unknown and 
untold, Mireille knew her family&#39;s history by heart, or at least the 
parts that her uncle Claude had taught her. The Bouquet&#39;s aristocratic 
history that stretched back several hundred years made a fancy piece of 
craftwork like the watch hardly unexpected.

As a young child, she had naturally wondered, asked and sometimes 
literally pined after answers to all those questions that circulated her 
childhood. The questions were always brushed off, left hanging or openly 
ignored, her stepmother had not been keen on receiving them, something 
the young Mireille learned quickly after moving in with the woman. The 
blonde could not blame her, and she seriously doubted that the woman 
could have known at all.

Being delivered into her Uncle Claude&#39;s hands had been something of a 
relief. Claude was not as strict with her when it came to everyday life, 
and had even taken her out to parks and festivities on occasions. The 
sudden move from the countryside to Paris had been a shock to her, but 
it paled in comparison to the shock in having a gun thrust into her 
hands for the first time.

She had been twelve, and Claude, her kind uncle, taught her to 
play-shoot at targets. But in all his honest joy about his precious 
niece, the man never did speak about his sister. He would ruffle her 
hair, praise her accomplishments and spoil her, but all her desperate 
questions about her family would fall on deaf ears.

It was not his place. So he had said, but Mireille could still not until 
this day, years after his death, understand why. Her only uncle, her 
only living relative, had gone to his early grave, forever taking the 
answers to her life with him. Claude had been an honourable man, a true 
Corsican, and trained her well to be the best in the only profession 
that was known to him. Mireille owed him her life many and many times 
over, having the mark of his rigorous training forever sweated, pounded 
and etched into her body.

The assassin let a small rueful smile light up her face at her own 
musing. Maybe she did have ulteriormotives with the whole thing as well, 
just as she suspected her counterpart had. For the first time in many 
years, maybe - and just maybe -something that could be related to her 
family had turned up. Sent by an unknown factor, and carrying an 
unwished for package, but still all better than nothing. She gave the 
girl by her window a quick peek before returning to her mail, not 
wanting to be caught.

A small beep from her monitor broke her chain of thoughts. After giving 
the mail&#39;s content a quick scan; she had to raise her eyebrows in 
pleased surprise.

&quot;Kirika?&quot;

It took a few seconds for Kirika to react at the call, still not 
accustomed to actually hearing the syllables that formed her name be 
verbally spoken. She turnedtowards the only other occupant in the room 
slowly, as if having been in deep thoughts when interrupted. The blonde, 
Mireille, was yet again seated behind her computer and searching among 
her informants regarding the despicable silver watch that hung around 
her neck.

The nightwalker had more or less decided to give up the whole issue of 
information gathering to the other woman. Not that she&#39;d have been of 
much help. She doubted the assassin would remove the watch to let her 
roam on her own, and to be honest, Kirika had a feeling that Mireille&#39;s 
underworld network surpassed her own knowledge tremendously. Still, 
while not showing it, the inactivity irked her.

With a still, cautious expression adorning her face, Mireille gestured 
her towards the pool table, finally having found something that was of 
value.

It was a casual gesture, one which had thrown her completely off balance 
at the beginning. The woman always treated her in such a distant yet 
remarkable human manner, it was - for lack of a better word - weird. A 
way of interaction that had been her entirely unfamiliar, and while 
Mireille was not exactly warm towards her, it was certainly not what 
Kirika had expected.

But then again, it was far better than having the assassin a scared 
wreck on the constant edge of break-down while being near her.

To her surprise, a small smile was tugging at the other woman&#39;s lips. It 
was the first time, during those days where Kirika more or less had been 
her prisoner that the woman showed a positive expression.

&quot;We have a lead, look at this.&quot; She said, while Kirika rounded the pool 
table and stood beside her. The monitor showed the blurred photo of a 
quite stern, elderly looking man, with a shock of white hair and a face 
so lined with age that he reminded Kirika of a withered old tree. Still, 
despite the sad quality of the photo, there was no mistaking that he 
bore his stature with pride, like it showed in his features. The long 
face, with a somewhat pointy nose that once might have been handsome 
stared out at them hungrily from the monitor.

Mireille browsed her way through a few menus as her printer came to life 
in a series of beeping noises, ensuring themselves a copy of the photo 
and the letter that followed it.

&quot;Andr&#130; Schumann, originally from Switzerland. Moved to Paris after the 
war together with his family business.&quot; She scrolled down, pointing out 
the information. &quot;Apparently, the Schumann family were a renowned name 
in excellent craftsmanship when it came to watches and clocks.&quot;

&quot;Were?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he seems to have done some shady business during the wars, forcing 
their family to flee. They didn&#39;t do all too well in Paris it seems, the 
information says that they became involved in the underworld at some 
point.&quot; The blonde&#39;s brows tightened a little, pondering something for a 
few seconds before continuing. &quot;I wonder what happened. Switzerland has 
alwaysbeen neutral ground, even in times of war.&quot;

Kirika read on, her expression indifferent. &quot;The source?&quot;

&quot;Reliable. I passed a few photos of the watch around, it seems like it 
was Schumann who took the bait himself.&quot;

The dark-haired girl didn&#39;t respond. It wasn&#39;t a very solid lead, but as 
for now, it was all they had.

&quot;The photo is old.&quot; She pointed out.

&quot;I guess, like he himself probably is now as well.&quot; The assassin 
shrugged. &quot;It could be a dead end, but for now, it&#39;s all we have.&quot; 
Mireille shot the girl beside her a questioning look, and Kirika merely 
nodded.

&quot;Today?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

And there was nothing else to be said.

-

Paris in the evening was nice. Kirika had to admit that much as she and 
Mireille made their way through the streets. People were milling around 
them in their daily business, buying groceries or hurrying home after 
finishing another day of tiring work. She felt strangely uncomfortable 
in the bustle however, not because she was among humans or was being 
seen but because of the taller woman that was walking beside her.

The blonde had been oddly quiet ever since they left the apartment. With 
the address and photo of Schumann neatly tucked into her breast pocket, 
Mireille had ignored her presence after she had caught up with her 
steps. It was frustrating that she was unable to even walk as fast as 
she would have liked to, but she was at least grateful that the pain had 
subsided somewhat with the days.

Kirika tucked her hands into her parka&#39;s pockets, squirming a little to 
adjust the green, sleeveless pullover Mireille had bought her. The soft 
cotton grinded the now familiar metal object around her neck against the 
yellow t-shirt she wore inside.

She was out. For the first time in a long while, all due to the silver 
watch for which she wished nothing more than to tear off.

Another odd thing struck her.

She was not thirsty.

How long had it been? Not too long, but long enough. She should feel the 
pull, the need. Her body should be stirring, reminding her of the needs 
it craved. Yet it didn&#39;t and that was worrisome. While she doubted that 
it yet would be of danger to her, it was of great concern. Her powers - 
however useless they were at the moment - had their source from what she 
drew and fed from the blood, like her very life. Theoretically speaking, 
it really was a thirst like humans thirsted after water. A mechanism of 
her immortal body that served as a reminder, pulling her to attend its 
needs like a hungry man craving for food. If it didn&#39;t work, the outcome 
was rather obvious. Subconsciously, Kirika reached up to her torso.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I was you.&quot; The words came like a rap from a 
whip. She stopped her hands immediately. The blonde woman didn&#39;t look at 
her, but continued herspeeding down the road.

Kirika lowered her arms. So she was being watched.

&quot;We don&#39;t want to make a scene.&quot;

Of course.

The streets turned narrower and narrower as they made their way between 
the houses. Kirika noticed that they had entered the part of Paris that 
was the oldest, but not the most prestigious. Most of the houses 
consisted of a darker shade of wood with layers and layers of paint 
trying to cover up its decaying surface. Both the lower floors of the 
buildings and the streets were made of stone, all looking equally 
battered bythe passing of age. Contrary to the slum however, it was all 
still fairly clean. The residents had made a serious attempt to make 
their homes more appealing by planting a few pots of flowers here and 
there. Only a minimum of trash could be seen, and the air smelled like 
wet mud, and spicy oil.

A girl Kirika&#39;s age walked past them, forcing them to press themselves 
against the walls to be able to let her pass. Mireille gave her a kind, 
reassuring smile when she stared at the blonde&#39;s classy clothes with 
uncertain eyes, fiddling with her own worn out coat while she brushed a 
few red-dyed bangs from her freckly face. She mumbled a hasty apology 
and ran past, disappearing among the myriad of passages.

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Mireille stopped in front of a dark, wooden door with 
metal reinforcements that looked like it was going to fall over at any 
time. She looked over at Kirika who just looked at it indifferently.

&quot;Someone is waiting for us.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mireille said, rather surprised. Kirika turned to face the 
blonde, putting an emphasis on her words with her equally rapt gaze.

&quot;Someone is coming. They know we are here.&quot;

&quot;How many?&quot; Her voice was steady, but rather quiet as she mouthed the 
question. The assassin&#39;s hand went slowly into her purse as she spoke, 
gripping her gun.

Kirika narrowed her eyes in a small frown of concentration, straining 
her ears to the outmost.

&quot;One.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes. The footsteps are light, it is either a small person or he is 
walking very quietly.&quot;

Mireille stared at her in amazement. Kirika could almost feel the 
blonde&#39;s mind brimming over with ideas and possibilities with such a 
skill at hand. The question on the tip of the woman&#39;s tongue was left 
unvoiced however, as the door in front of them indeed rattled, and was 
swung open. Surprisingly, the heavy wood didn&#39;t creaklike one would have 
expected. It moved with the foreboding silence of a coffin. A - as 
Kirika had foreseen - small man with short, well-trimmed brown hair and 
good-natured face greeted them. He gave the both of them a small bow, 
carefully scrutinizing them with eyes sparkling of boyish curiosity, and 
gestured them to step inside.

The room they arrived in was in better shape and spoke of good and 
skilful maintenance compared to the outside. As expected from something 
that was probably built in the same age as the Bastille, the roof was 
low on the first floor. While being merely pressing to someone of 
Kirika&#39;s height, Mireille had to bow down a little to not hit her head. 
The rest of the room was mostly empty, serving as a kind of lobby with 
only a few chairs and a dried out painting to add to its decor.

Despite the room being was empty, Kirika noticed that Mireille had never 
takenher hand from the purse. The woman was not one for surprises.

&quot;We are here to meet Monsieur Schumann, he should have been informed 
beforehand.&quot;

&quot;Ah, of course.&quot; The man nodded, and gave them a rather apologetic face. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say that my father is resting at the moment, would it be 
sufficient for both mademoisellesto wait a while? I would prefer to let 
him sleep another half an hour before waking him.&quot;

Kirika looked at Mireille who didn&#39;t return the favour.

&quot;We&#39;ll wait.&quot;

The assassin&#39;s tone softened when the man gave them a genuine grateful 
look. Kirika got the feeling that the small man wasn&#39;t used to having 
his requests granted.

&quot;Is there anything I could help you with while waiting? I&#39;m afraid to 
say that I&#39;ve taken over most of our family business since my father&#39;s 
age became burdensome for him.&quot; He said, while gesturing them to sit 
down on the rangy chairs.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that, we were not informed monsieur...?&quot;

&quot;Alexji.&quot; He drew out the vowels while pronouncing it.

&quot;That&#39;s an unusual name for a Swiss.&quot; Alexji laughed.

&quot;My mother did the naming after my grandfather when they fled from the 
east, so yes, unusual indeed. But if you don&#39;t mind...&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;So, what could two beautiful mademoiselles from the upper city want 
with my father?&quot;

Mireille hesitated. The thoughts of the woman pressed into Kirika&#39;s mind 
unbidden as they sat beside each other. The woman wasn&#39;t sure if she 
wanted to trust any information with Schumann&#39;s son, and they still 
didn&#39;t know who it was that had taken the bait. Had it really been Andre 
Schumann himself, if he indeed was that old? Kirika reached out towards 
the man&#39;s thoughts but all she managed was creating a dull ringing sound 
inside her eardrums.

&quot;We&#39;ve heard that you father is a skilled craftsman and had expertise in 
the field.&quot;

&quot;He indeed is, if he still had the sight for it.&quot; The words had an 
underlying sigh in it, giving him the light of being the perfect proper 
and worrying son. &quot;I have to admit that I&#39;m not even breaching his skill 
at my age.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re here to ask him to look at something for us.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m sure he will gladly do so. But you surely realize that it will 
cost?&quot; The same pleasant smile, but now with a certain smirk behind it. 
&quot;As refined as you couple of ladies look, I&#39;m sure you know by your 
presence here what kind of shop we are running.&quot;

&quot;High-class imitations and copies of valuables, like the import and 
export of those am I right?&quot;

Alexji barked out a short laughter. &quot;To put it politely yes, even if we 
mostly handle the export. You&#39;re well-informed miss...?&quot;

&quot;Miss will do MonsieurAlexji.&quot; The blonde&#39;s tone was still kind, but now 
with a certain razor behind it. &quot;Actually, it was your father who gave 
us the offer, or we may have never found our way here.&quot; The man raised 
his eyebrows at this, making a face of surprise.

&quot;H-he did?&quot; Alexji almost gaped. &quot;When..? How did he...?&quot; His earlier 
composure fell as he stuttered in something between disbelief and joy. 
Kirika shot Mireille a quick peek, not sure of what to make out of the 
man&#39;s unexpected behaviour.

The nightwalker fought the urge to twist her face into a confused frown, 
somewhat realizing her own limitations when it came down to human 
communication. While her kind possessed all the aspects that were needed 
to be a pretended social butterfly, it had never really been her ace. 
Humans had never really concerned her before she ran into Mireille, who 
was something entirely more than a mere distraction.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, but my father pulled out from his work entirely at his 
retirement. This is the first time...&quot; His face cracked up in a broad 
and honest smile as he talked. &quot;Shall we go and wake him then?&quot;

They passed a long hallway until arriving before a set of wooden stairs 
that looked as if they could collapse at any second. Kirika noticed 
curiously that, despite being a producer and bootlegger of illegal art 
copies, the house was surprisingly undecorated in its interior. There 
was not a single painting or piece of art that even reminded of 
something esthetical. The green-painted stone walls all remained cold 
and empty on their way upwards until Alexji stopped in front of a heavy 
wooden door and asked them to wait outside while he would notify the 
older Schumann.

Mireille shot her a quick, stern glance. The blonde must mean that she 
didn&#39;t want a scene from her under any circumstances. Of course, after 
finding Kirika lifeless after her latest attempt with the watch, the 
worry was justified. The girl also noticed that the assassin had since 
their arrival perfectly steered the conversation with Alexji to not 
involve her under any circumstances. Quite impressive. She could have 
been invisible for all she knew, all of the man&#39;s concentration had with 
a few words and a smile been focused on Mireille.

Alexji turned up at the door, waving them inside with a polite sweep. 
The blonde didn&#39;t give her another look as she stepped through the 
doorframe, with Kirika a few steps behind. The room they arrived in was 
dimly lit, antique in its furnishing and seemed to be entirely crammed 
with bookcases which in their place were crammed to the fullest with a 
library&#39;s worth of books. Despite that it was still before noon, few of 
the light-rays actually seemed to make their way through the two indeed 
small, but wide-open windows. The stale air which smelled of old paper 
and still damp ink assaulted her nose. The only thing that was somewhat 
modern seemed to be the large armchair that occupied what little place 
was left by the bookcases.

In the middle of it all sat a very old, weary looking man, dressed in 
dark-coloured formal attire consisting of an older kind of suit. His, 
what may have once been brown-coloured hair was tied back into a small 
but well-groomed ponytail. His hair, eyebrows and moustache had all 
likewise been drained of colour, leaving only a few strands here and 
there for the keen eye. He had the same long, wrinkled face as the man 
from the photo, if possible, now with even more wrinkles that showed the 
burden of his age.

The old man, whom Kirika assumed was Andre Schumann, seemed to be 
sleeping when they stepped in and did not even bother to raise his head 
to greet them. But the overly even breath that rasped from his throat 
told her something else. With a thick pair of glasses weighing down his 
face, he looked like the classical scholar.

&quot;Alexji.&quot; The voice was creaked, dried, but careful, having lost none of 
its intelligent edge. &quot;Have you sent Danielle away? I don&#39;t want her 
here when there&#39;s business.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I called her mother.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now,&quot; Opening his eyes very slowly, as if a great weight was 
holding it down, he turned towards them. &quot;I will not ask for your names. 
I&#39;ve been here for too long to not see the stupidity of some etiquette. 
But I will-&quot; He drew another raspy breath, before continuing. &quot;however 
ask you to come closer, my sight is not what it once was and I prefer to 
see faces.&quot;

&quot;Monsieur Schumann, we are much obliged and grateful for you having us.&quot; 
Mireille said.

The old man did not answer as they stepped over various piles of books 
and papers before stopping in front of his chair. Kirika stood slightly 
behind Mireille, calm but utterly at loss of what to do. Andre looked 
them over from head to toe, one at a time, something that made Kirika 
quite uncomfortable.

He stopped at Mireille and narrowed his eyes, concentrating on her face.

&quot;You&#39;re the owner of the watch.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question.

&quot;I am.&quot; Mireille replied with some surprise. &quot;How did you know?&quot;

He chuckled. &quot;Child, a maker should always know the owner in this field 
of work.&quot; He paused, and eyed Kirika with a long, piercing stare. &quot;But 
I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m not its maker, I merely had the chance to 
repair it once. It&#39;s quite a piece of art and I could be no older than 
my son right now when I last held it.&quot; Another pause. &quot;May I see it?&quot; 
Somehow, the nightwalker got the feeling of that Andre was not as blind 
as he wanted people to believe.

The blonde nodded and turned to Kirika who almost took a step backwards 
in surprise when the blonde reached around her neck to lift out the 
chain. Mireille brushed aside her hair carefully, pulling up the watch 
with minimum of movement and placed the silver object atop of the girl&#39;s 
pullover in front of her chest. The dark haired girl cringed when the 
metal moved, slithering against her skin as she leaned forwards so 
Schumann could see.

She was not amused by this, but really had little choice. Alexji was 
looking at her in a funny way, no doubt wondering why she wasn&#39;t taking 
it off but being too polite to mention anything. Mireille on the other 
hand was standing beside her with the same seemingly ingrown expression. 
The formal but pleasant smile on her porcelain face was strained 
nonetheless, and her anxiety became almost physical for Kirika who was 
standing so close. One wrong tug from Schumann spelled disaster.

Hard-edged pieces of charcoal pierced through her when she faced front 
again. Schumann was no longer watching the watch, but straight into her 
eyes with a gaze so intense it could have made a stone quiver. Kirika 
answered the gaze likewise, she had seen it before, humans who thought 
themselves to be of wisdom and knowledge, and who ensured others of 
their knowledge through their age.

...but never from less than two feet distance. They were so close in 
fact, that she could smell the sour remains of caffeine and sugar that 
lingered in the old man&#39;s breath, which she didn&#39;t enjoy at all.

The two of them held the gaze for the longest time, until Andre broke 
the silence with something like disbelief, and amusement shining in his 
eyes.

&quot;Alexji, I need you to run an errand for me.&quot;

The younger man stared at him, baffled. But his father interrupted him 
before he could question it.

&quot;Monsieur Rochere has a book by Hegel I need right now. Go and get it 
for me. I don&#39;t recall the name but tell him that and he will know which 
one I want.&quot;

&quot;But fathe...&quot;

&quot;Did you not hear me incompetent boy? I said I need it, now go!&quot; He 
barked. Alexji cringed and frowned somewhat disapprovingly at the 
elderly man, but gave them a weak nod. &quot;By the way, you should drop by 
your wife for once, say hi to Danielle from me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in an hour.&quot; The middle-aged man replied as he hurried 
out, bidding them a hasty farewell.

Kirika listened to the creaking from the departing footsteps until the 
door below closed, Schumann&#39;s attention now being once again focused on 
them. Mireille raised her eyebrows in a silent question, also finding it 
somewhat funny that at his age, the man was still protecting his son 
from things that may be better unknown. Was Alexji truly that 
incompetent, or was it something else? This stuck a warning bell inside 
her head, it seemed like they might get more than what they originally 
bargained for upon the decision to come here.

Schumann knew something, and the assassin wasn&#39;t sure of what it was.

The wrinkles in his face stretched and cracked like dry earth as his 
face changed, gone was the stern formality of the seasoned academician, 
left was something else, less logical but more alert.

The silence in the room screamed, neither Mireille nor Kirika being 
entirely sure of what to expect at this point.

&quot;Two women,&quot; Andre started, voice now stronger. &quot;In togas of ancient 
Greece, each wielding a sword to the other&#39;s honour. Their heads crowned 
by wreaths of laurel, the sign of ultimate power and they face each 
other in salute, on their knees with the blades raised in front of them. 
Am I right?&quot; He asked, turning to Mireille while pushing the black 
rimmed glasses further up his nose. And all of sudden, he seemed to have 
shrunk, as if crushed by the weight of a lifetime of burden. The 
newfound strength in his voice bristled as he spoke, like a leaf waiting 
for the autumn storm, expecting to be crushed at the slightest movement.

&quot;Am I right, lady lynx of Corsica?&quot;
