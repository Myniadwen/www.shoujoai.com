<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Asked to wait for the brunette, Mireille did so. She patiently waited 
for Kirika and sat quietly at first on a chair in the clinic&#39;s living 
room. A few minutes passed by just by the blonde sitting there. Finally, 
Mireille felt bored. She realized that she had been waiting alone, 
because so far no one invited the clinic. The blonde stood up and 
hummed, while wandered aimlessly. As Kirika hadn&#39;t showed up yet, 
Mireille just continued repeated all the things she had done before to 
kill time.

The blonde once again throw herself on the chair she had been sitting on 
before. ... She has known about Dr. Naomi.. thanks to me. Mireille 
slightly shook her head. No. It isn&#39;t a mistake to tell her. I did the 
right thing..,didn&#39;t I..? She seems happy to meet her mother.. Who 
won&#39;t, after all..?

The blonde let out a long sighed and looked at the house ceiling. 
Despite her facial look, the blonde was seriously frustrated. The 
Corsican girl started arguing to herself, as usual.

As Mireille was still occupied by her mind, she didn&#39;t hear someone&#39;s 
footsteps approaching. &quot;She said she wanted to talk to you, too.&quot; a 
voice calmly said.

Mireille almost jumped when she suddenly heard the voice. She glanced to 
her left and looked at the person who caused it. She saw a pair of brown 
eyes was looking at her. The blonde quickly analyzed the face of the 
girl beside her. Still, the brunette&#39;s face was as expressionless as 
ever. Mireille felt relieved by it. She&#39;s not stressed, then..

The blonde didn&#39;t realize that she hadn&#39;t replied Kirika&#39;s sentence. 
&quot;Mireille..? &quot; The Japanese-looking girl said slowly. &quot;Are you 
alright..?&quot;

Alright...?Am I look like sick for you..? Just then, the blonde realized 
that she didn&#39;t really pay attention to what Kirika said before. She 
focused her mind, and finally remembered what exactly Kirika was asking 
about. &quot;Uh.. Sorry, .&quot; Mireille looked at Kirika, a bit embarrassed. 
&quot;She wants to talk to me..?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Why in the world that she prefer talking with me to talking with her own 
daughter..? Mirelle said softly. &quot;I see.&quot;

The blonde looked at Kirika for some time, as if wanted to ask 
something. But in the end, she turned her back and said nothing, and 
quietly moved her feet. As Mireille had started walking, she suddenly 
realized that Kirika didn&#39;t follow her. She turned her back and saw the 
Japanese girl was simply watching her.

&quot;I&#39;ll wait here.&quot; Kirika stated shortly.

&quot;Oh..&quot; She wants to talk to me alone.., huh..? As Mireille arrived in 
front of the destination door, she knocked twice at it.

&quot;Come in, Mireille.&quot; said a voice that likely was Dr. Naomi&#39;s.

Mireille opened the door and stepped in. The blonde instantly sat 
herself on the big sofa, and saw that Dr. Naomi was smiling, or rather 
grinning.

&quot;Are you really done talking with Kirika..?&quot; Mireille abruptly asked. 
Somehow she didn&#39;t feel like in the mood to reply the female vet&#39;s smile 
toward her.

&quot;Not really, actually. I still have a lot to talk with her about.&quot; Dr. 
Naomi&#39;s grin became even wider. &quot;It can wait, after all.&quot;

She doesn&#39;t invite me only to show her weird smile to me, does she..? 
Mireille looked seriously at Dr. Naomi. &quot;So, what is it that made you 
want to talk to me..?&quot;

&quot;I want you to just listen to me.&quot; Dr. Naomi simply answered in a 
cheerful tone.

&quot;Will you..?&quot; Mireille thought for a while. &quot;..Okay.&quot; she muttered 
softly.

Upon hearing the answer, a serious look replaced the smile on Dr. 
Naomi&#39;s face.

&quot;You know.. When you two came an hour ago wearing the same expression, I 
felt that all my life was betting on the event coming after.&quot; Dr. Naomi 
said softly.

Mireille kept silent, as she said no words.

&quot;I felt afraid at that time, and my heart was beating like crazy. I know 
that she must already know about me..&quot; Dr. Naomi stopped, as if trying 
to remember something. &quot;The moment she told me she hated me, I felt I 
was ready to accept death.&quot;

You should have told her yourself sooner.., don&#39;t you think..??

Dr. Naomi stopped talking for some time. But so sudden after that, her 
silence was over and the female vet smiled cheerfully.

&quot;I feel really happy and relieved that she wants to talk to me after.&quot;

&quot;Mmm..&quot; Mireille made a grumbling noise.

&quot;Thank you very much, Mireille. I can&#39;t tell you what for to be exact, 
but I really feel like doing so.&quot;

Yeah.. after all it is all thanks to me.. &quot;..kay.&quot; Mireille muttered.

Dr. Naomi continued talking. &quot;I know that I am not supposed to hope that 
she will receive me, after all I did to her. But somehow, I have a 
feeling that sooner or later she will accept me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you left her.&quot; Mireille muttered. &quot;You&#39;re lucky that she is 
kind.&quot;

&quot;Of course she is. She is my daughter. &quot; Dr. Naomi proudly said.

A moment of silence hanged between them for a couple minutes.

&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering for long..&quot; Mireille slowly said, as she looked 
seriously at the brown pairs of eyes in front of her. &quot;What exactly was 
happened with Kirika..?&quot;

As already expected the question, Dr. Naomi made not a slightest bit 
reaction of surprise and calmly answered, &quot;That&#39;s what I want you to 
listen to me for.&quot;

&quot;So, what happened..?&quot; Mireille insisted.

Dr. Naomi smiled slightly, and told Mireille the story.

&quot;It was around sixteen years ago when Kirika was born. The truth is, she 
was born in Japan, in a remote village, one that wasn&#39;t related to 
world&#39;s problem at all. When she was born, all my husband and I felt was 
happiness. She&#39;s gorgeus. As a baby, Kirika grew normally with me. She 
was supposed to be a normal kid later, but unfortunately a descendant of 
my family had a different fate which can&#39;t be denied. Let&#39;s just say 
that we are a family who has to learn fighting. We learn it to become 
some kind of bodyguard. You must know that many important people have 
lots of people who want to kill them, right..? Old fashion as we may be, 
we compete with other old families to become the best &quot;bodyguards&quot;. Our 
family is well known as the best one to choose for among others. It must 
be hard to believe our existence nowadays, as those kind of things are 
not common knowledge.&quot;

Mireille gave a look of confused to Dr. Naomi.

The female vet smiled and said, &quot;You must wonder why old families like 
us can use guns but not katanas,right..? We followed the change of era, 
of course.&quot;

The blonde nodded in understanding slightly. Dr. Naomi stopped for a 
moment to breathe, and continued.

&quot;Once Kirika reached age two, it was a fate that she was separated from 
me. She soon will reach the age when one should be trained to protect 
somebody. It used to be boys who were trained, but the circumstances 
couldn&#39;t be helped. It was really a crisis that day. As there was not 
much descendant who was willing at that time, Kirika was trained harshly 
to fulfill our family purpose, whatever it was at that time. It couldn&#39;t 
be avoided since Kirika was a daughter of my husband, who was a prodigy 
at all martial arts. My grandfather who taught her was somewhat proud of 
her outstanding skill. He trained her with all his might. He hoped 
Kirika could be the best amongst the family. But some event occurred and 
grandpa became unstable. I guessed he met with troubles which made him 
very depressed. In the end he trained Kirika more and more intensely 
everyday and worse, without affection at all. I couldn&#39;t meet Kirika at 
all, as my grandfather didn&#39;t allow it at all. My grandfather would 
violently torture Kirika if she made a little mistake. As expected, the 
effect wasn&#39;t good. Grandpa overdid it. I heard that Kirika would finish 
her training wounded all over her body. Her eyes also reflected deep 
sadness and depression. She would sometimes scream at people with no 
reason, or did some other weird things. She was a kid, after all. She 
lacked love and comfort for children her age.&quot;

Mireille listened seriously to Dr. Naomi. She noticed that the female 
vet&#39;s facial expression change a little bit sadder as the story was told 
further more.

&quot;Knowing that Kirika was gradually trained as if she were a machine, I 
couldn&#39;t sit still. As a mother, I decided to save her. One day I 
sneaked into my grandfather&#39;s place at night, and took Kirika with me. 
My husband was also agreed and joined me, protecting Kirika on our way 
to escape. At first, we assumed that we would be okay as we could run 
fast. But the problem came later. We were haunted by grandpa&#39;s 
underlings as we ran away. My husband told me to just leave, and he 
would take care of those men. I tried my best to come to the destination 
place where I&#39;ve found to leave Kirika. It was some kind of a peaceful 
house, with a field of wine. I thought it was a nun&#39;s academy, or 
something. I met the head of that house in panic, a woman named Altena. 
She kindly welcomed Kirika, without asking much. Her manner impressed 
me, and I just felt like trusting her. Relieved that Kirika would be 
safe here, I continued to run away. My father may punish me, but not 
Kirika.&quot;

Mireille couldn&#39;t help but surprised after hearing the story. She didn&#39;t 
expect Kirika or Dr. Naomi to be burdened by such fate because of their 
family.

As Dr. Naomi was taking her breath, the blonde asked slowly, &quot;What 
happened after..?&quot;

&quot;I was secluded at some place, forbid to do anything.&quot; The female vet 
said softly. &quot;But my grandfather died a year ago. So I&#39;m free. That&#39;s 
why I searched for my daughter.&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s your husband,now..?&quot;

&quot;He is..&quot; Dr. Naomi whispered weakly, &quot;already passed away.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; The blonde quickly said.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;

Mireille changed the topic, &quot;Do you know that the peaceful place you 
talking about..&quot; The blonde&#39;s gaze fell upon the brown orbs in front 
her. &quot;It&#39;s not a nun academy, you know.&quot;

Dr. Naomi smiled slightly. &quot;Yes. But I still can&#39;t imagine Kirika 
trained with my grandpa any longer.&quot;

Trained there or not, she was a killing machine, once..

&quot;Hmm..&quot; grumbled Mireille. The blonde slowly looked at Dr. Naomi. &quot;Did 
Kirika know about this..?&quot;

&quot;I have told her everything. But as I expected, she remembers nothing 
about it.&quot;

&quot;As you expected..?&quot; Mireille asked, perplexed.

&quot;She lost all her memories at that time, whether it was erased or not, I 
don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it was Altena&#39;s doing.&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Dr. Naomi said in a calm tone. &quot;You know, &quot; the female vet 
suddenly grinned at Mireille. &quot;The reason I told you about this..?&quot;

The blonde replied nothing and simply looked at Dr. Naomi, waiting an 
answer.

The older one of the two laughed. &quot;It&#39;s because I happened to see that 
you care for her.&quot; The word &quot;care&quot; was emphasized by Dr. Naomi for some 
reason.

Mireille in return blushed and looked at some place other than Dr. 
Naomi. What the..??!How could she know..??!!

&quot;Just kidding.&quot; Dr. Naomi stated cheerfully. &quot;But I&#39;m happy to realize 
that you care for her so much.&quot;

After a few more words, their conversation end. Dr. Naomi and Mireille 
stepped out of the room together. Then, Mireille found the brunette was 
doing something like playing with the animals in the clinic. Mireille 
called out the Japanese-looking girl&#39;s name. Heard that her name was 
called, the brunette glanced at the blonde and smiled slightly after. 
Kirika stood up and walked towards Mireille and Dr. Naomi.

&quot;Do you want to talk with Dr. Naomi again, Kirika..? I&#39;ve done talking.&quot; 
Mireille asked.

Kirika shook her head. &quot;Let&#39;s go.. home.&quot;

&quot;You two must be tired.&quot; Dr. Naomi said calmly. &quot;See you tomorrow then, 
Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; The Japanese girl replied.

Mireille and Kirika both excused their self after that. Dr. Naomi waved 
cheerfully to the two of them as the two left the clinic, walking slowly 
and waved back to her.

On their way to the apartment, Mireille couldn&#39;t help but felt worried 
on the brunette. Tough from the facial and physical look the brunette 
was as calm as usual. Mireille decided to ask later. They walked for 
about ten minutes before reached the apartment. Mireille unlocked the 
door and stepped in slowly, while Kirika followed behind.

&quot;I&#39;ll make tea.&quot; Kirika whispered to Mireille, as she headed to the 
kitchen.

Mireille let out a long sighed of exhaustion. Then she threw herself on 
her usual chair, waiting for the tea. Many thought were swinging in her 
mind.
Not too long after, Kirika brought the tea pot carefully to the table. 
As usual, Mireille took two cups first from the kitchen, before enjoying 
the tea. As the brunette was pouring the tea, the sign that the two of 
them were done with the preparations, Mireille silently gazed at the 
brunette&#39;s face. How much time left do I have to just look at her like 
this.. if she is about to leave..?

&quot;Here&#39;s your tea.&quot; Kirika said softly as she gave the cups to the 
blonde.

Mireille received the cup. The tea was still too hot to drink, so she 
decided to drink it later. The blonde unconsciously started gazing at 
Kirika again.

The brunette seemed to have noticed that Mireille was gazing at her, as 
her cheeks turned a little bit redder.

&quot;Mireille..?&quot; Kirika whispered softly, puzzled.

The blonde woke up. She looked up at Kirika and found that the Japanese 
girl was looking at her. Her brown orbs reflected confusion.

&quot;Felt sleepy..?&quot; Kirika slowly asked.

&quot;Uh.. No.&quot; the blonde muttered. &quot;I just... Nothing.&quot;

With that answer, Kirika silently sipped her tea while Mireille played 
with the spoon on her palms.

&quot;Kirika.. How do you feel right now..?&quot; Mireille asked softly.

The Japanese girl smiled. &quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;Really..?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Hmm.. She told me your life story, too..&quot; the blonde said, as a 
smile hanged on her face. &quot;Pretty interesting.&quot;

The Japanese girl looked confusedly at Mireille. &quot;You think so..?&quot;

&quot;Yeah..&quot; Mireille answered.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything... about it.&quot;

&quot;She told me that, too..&quot; Mireille smiled. &quot;Say, does Dr. Naomi really 
feel like your real mother..?&quot;

Kirika looked at Mireille and gazed at the blonde&#39;s blue orbs. &quot;I 
still.. don&#39;t know.&quot; She whispered softly.

&quot;Oh.. okay.&quot;

&quot;Uh..&quot; Kirika looked away from Mireille, and lowered her head. &quot;I just.. 
don&#39;t know what it feels like to have a family.&quot; she said softly. &quot;I.. 
don&#39;t know and remember much of people. I just know to kill, use weapon, 
or else.&quot;

Mireille realized the brunette&#39;s facial change. She then took one of 
Kirika&#39;s hands on the table and hold it tight. None of the two seemed to 
realize that they were now already used to that kind of contact. The 
blonde smiled, tried to comfort the younger girl in front of her.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to feel bad about it, Kirika. I understand.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s brown eyes fell upon Mireille. &quot;Maybe.. she really is my 
mother. Tough for now.. I still can&#39;t really tell the differences 
between her.. and other nice people.&quot;

The Japanese-looking girl grasped the blonde&#39;s hand. &quot;But.. I can tell 
that you aren&#39;t just nice, Mireille.&quot; she whispered in a very small 
voice. &quot;Different.&quot;

Mireille flushed upon hearing that. No. She didn&#39;t mean it like I 
thought it is, for sure.

&quot;Together with you.. are different..&quot; Kirika said slowly. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know.&quot; she sighed after saying that. Mireille smiled at the brunette.

&quot;Thank you, Kirika. You are not only nice to me, too.&quot;

Mireille felt some pain slipped inside her heart, as she couldn&#39;t tell 
Kirika how she cares so much about her, how she wants to embrace her so 
badly. Mireille admitted that she was afraid to tell the Japanese girl. 
The blonde didn&#39;t have the slightest bit of confidence that her feeling 
would be replied by the brunette.

Pushing all the desperating thought aside, Mireille smiled cheerfully at 
Kirika. &quot;You know.. There&#39;s no one else in the world that can make me 
blabber about everything I know, besides you.&quot; The blonde laughed after 
saying that.

Kirika in return also chuckled happily. The blonde&#39;s smiled grew wider 
as she looked at the brunette&#39;s laughing face. After that, both Mireille 
and Kirika talked about everything except anything related to Dr. Naomi. 
They simply enjoyed each other company, and talked until they felt 
sleepy and went to bed.</pre>
