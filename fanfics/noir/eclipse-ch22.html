Uncle and he nods his head at me.

&quot;Yes, you can go first. But just for five minutes. He&#39;s critically ill 
and we have much to do.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; I eagerly pull Mireille into the small room with me, 
hoping to get some answers. A strong, strange odor hits my nose, causing 
my eyes to water.

&quot;I hate hospitals.&quot; Mireille mutters under her breath.

I step forward, slightly intimidated by all the clicking machinery 
attached to the man in the bed. He&#39;s wrapped all over with white cloth 
and gauze, and the skin I can see looks horrible. Mireille leans over 
him.

&quot;Well, he&#39;s asleep. Now what do we do?&quot; she turns back around and looks 
at me, putting her hands on her hips. &quot;Should we wake him?&quot;

&quot;Noir...&quot; I can barely hear the whisper. I duck around Mireille and take 
a look. The man&#39;s eyes are now open, and looking sideways at me.

&quot;Of course you have come.&quot; his voice is hoarse, as if he has been 
yelling. &quot;Noir always destroys that which creates it.&quot; He closes his 
eyes again.

I look at Mireille. She looks as confused as I feel.

&quot;Come then, finish me off.&quot; he moans. &quot;I&#39;m in such pain...may the dark 
hands release me.&quot; He groans again, eyes still closed.

&quot;We didn&#39;t come to kill you.&quot; I want to take his hand, but am afraid of 
hurting him if I touch him. &quot;We came because of the book.&quot;

&quot;I have failed you.&quot; his eyelids flutter momentarily. &quot;Oh, why was I not 
destroyed too?&quot; his voice sounds as if he&#39;s ready to cry. I can feel his 
despair.

&quot;But the book wasn&#39;t destoyed!&quot; I blurt out, desperate to somehow 
console him. He makes a small coughing sound.

&quot;What- what-&quot; he coughs again, his eyes watering.

&quot;It was stolen by Dumond Droger.&quot; Mireille says evenly. &quot;Do you know-&quot;

&quot;Droger! God help us!&quot; his head jerks up and then drops back as he 
chokes out a pained moan. The machinery starts wildly beeping. I jump 
back, bumping into Mireille. The door flings open and the nurse rushes 
in, her face livid with anger.

&quot;What are you doing to him!&quot; she runs past us to the clicking machinery. 
&quot;Get out!&quot;

&quot;You must get it back!&quot; Frere Mueller&#39;s voice is so hoarse I can barely 
understand him. His padded hand reaches out, trying to grab mine. 
&quot;Promise me!&quot; I lean forward and take his hand, his eyes burning a plea 
into my heart.

&quot;I said get out!&quot; the nurse breaks my hand from his, pushing us back. 
Mireille curses under her breath and turns to the door. I shove the 
nurse aside, hearing her hit the floor behind me. I kneel down next to 
the moaning figure. His eyes are full of tears.

&quot;Promise me....don&#39;t let him destroy you. An-&quot; he gasps out. I hear the 
commotion behind me and feel hands on my shoulders, roughly pulling me 
to my feet.

&quot;I promise!&quot; I&#39;m being yanked backward now, out into the hall. Something 
is flashing red and people are milling all around, but I can only 
concentrate on one thing.

Promise me...don&#39;t let him destroy you.</pre>
