	Kirika&#39;s breath was against her throat, warming her sensitive skin 
as the beautiful girl stretched along her body, letting their skin 
caress against each other as their passions ignited. Driving them both 
towards their goal. 

	The Corsican leaned her body back, arching her spine to press more 
of her body against Kirika&#39;s, the girl rewarded her enthusiasm with a 
deep and passionate kiss making Mireille moan in sheer pleasure at the 
exquisite feelings running through her body. Even as Kirika gambled and 
moved her hand up Mireille&#39;s thigh, drawing out the blonde&#39;s quick 
breath.

	Mireille gasped as she felt what she had longed after for so long, 
she threw her head back in pleasure. 

	Her head smashed against the headboard. 

	&quot;Owwwww!!!!&quot; Mireille moaned painfully as she rubbed what was fast 
becoming a bump on the back of her head, there was no blood, but it 
still stung. She was, or had been laying on the bed, and had obviously 
shimmied back whilst in the throes of her dream, and moved a little too 
close to the solid end of the bed. 

	Her dream..... It crashed back, the reason why she was hot, sweaty 
and breathing hard. Her entire body was flushed a deep red. Mireille was 
more angry than embarrassed. Angry and tearful almost. Furious that her 
treacherous body had turned against her, had disregarded her orders, was 
it so needy for contact?

	And tearful that she could not control it. She had always 
considered herself a calm and independent woman, who had complete 
control over her life and her fate. To feel the effects of her own body 
working against her was less than confidence inspiring. It was a 
breaking of everything she held important, of her entire life. 

	Why? I&#39;ve never had these thoughts before, not even for men beyond 
a young curiosity, why do I keep thinking of her.... Am I so desperate 
for contact? So damned needy of another&#39;s affection.....? I don&#39;t need 
anyone&#39;s approval, I never have before. Why now?

	Was she getting soft in her old age? Or was it what living with 
another human being did to you. If so then Mireille was not sure she 
liked the change such a circumstance was having on her. Surely it was 
better to be as she had been before? The cold ruthless assassin for 
hire. 

	And just where the hell was Kirika!? Mireille checked the clock on 
the side. The red dials read 11:12pm..... Kirika was late.... Never did 
it occur to Mireille that she might be in trouble, something just told 
her that she would know if such a thing had happened to the girl. No, 
Kirika was just disobeying her...

	Again the thought came that she might be with someone. Perhaps 
sating her drug induced urges. She had taken her money with her.... 
Mireille shook her head. Quite frankly she doubted Kirika even knew 
people like that existed, and she defenitely wouldn&#39;t know where to go 
to find them. 

	Her mind continued to wander, and her worry to grow. And Mireille 
was well aware that all her worry was turning to anger. She heard a key 
turn in the lock, some fumbling as someone tried to open the door. 
Mireille could tell by the perfectly silent manner the person navigated 
the room, even fooling her senses, that it was Kirika. The door to the 
bedroom softly opened.

	There she stood, standing still, her eyes open wide in surprise, 
she was dressed in her sleeping attire, apparently having planned to 
slip quietly into bed. She looked tired, and yet alert, her mouth opened 
in a small &quot;Oh&quot; of surprise as her eyes took in the furious blonde 
sitting on the bed. Mireille snarled angrily, fully showing her rage.

	&quot;Just where the hell have you been. I told you to be back by ten! 
I want answers now!&quot; Mireille shifted her weight angrily on the bed, to 
better allow her to fix the young Asian with an angry glare.

	&quot;I was just out....&quot; Kirika whispered, her voice suggesting that 
she didn&#39;t want to talk.

	&quot;Where?!&quot; Mireille snapped, her voice showing that they were going 
to talk. Kirika shifted uncomfortably, fighting the urge to run.

	&quot;Just to a small restaurant.....&quot; She whispered not meeting 
Mireille&#39;s icy blue eyes. Despite herself Mireille felt her mind pause.

	&quot;...Alone....?&quot; She asked, dreading an answer, the way that Kirika 
looked away as if in shame was answer enough. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Kirika looked away shamefully, the very idea of lying to Mireille 
made her feel like the lowest form of life, she knew she was more than 
deserving of her love&#39;s ire. 

	&quot;Not alone then....&quot; Mireille answered quietly when Kirika did not 
answer, apparently mistaking her guilty silence as an answer to her 
previous question. Kirika could not stop her eyes from widening at the 
sheer seething anger in Mireille&#39;s tone.

	&quot;Mireille.... are you angry...?&quot; The question seemed to catch the 
blonde off guard, momentarily making her mask of anger slip as her own 
blue eyes widened in confusion, before going back to the furious slits 
of ice.

	&quot;What if it happens again, like with the artist!?&quot; Kirika looked 
away, a painful twisting in her heart making her spirits sink. Why did 
Mireille always have to remind her of Milosh..... The kind man had died 
because of Kirika&#39;s mistakes... Couldn&#39;t she ever learn to live with the 
memories without the pain in her heart. Through her pain she answered 
without thinking.

	&quot;I won&#39;t let that happen to her-&quot;

	&quot;Her...&quot; The blonde mumbled, her shoulders tensing in anger and 
her eyes almost sparking. Kirika was instantly snapped out of her daze 
at the sight of the woman before her. Furious and raging she looked like 
a wild animal, it was like being in the presence of a beautiful and 
dangerous creature, like a puma, and yet being able to admire it&#39;s sleek 
beauty. So it was with Mireille, even though her hackles were raised and 
her face a thunder cloud, so Kirika could see the wild raging blue of 
her eyes, the way her blonde hair fell in disarray around her face. She 
was beautiful. A force of nature.

	&quot;I&#39;m going to bed.&quot; Mireille angrily snapped, turning back and 
pulling the blankets over her, as Kirika continued to stand in the 
doorway, unsure of what to do. Mireille glanced at her, her eyes still 
angry. &quot;Well!?&quot; She snapped, her arms holding the covers open to the 
young girl. Kirika nodded but didn&#39;t smile, sure that such a reaction 
would lose her the chance to sleep in the bed. 

	She walked slowly forwards and laid down, not planning to snuggle 
close, still fairly sure that Mireille would hit her. 

	So she was surprised when Mireille&#39;s arms encircled her almost 
instantly, wrapping tightly around her abdomen and dragging her in 
close. Keeping Kirika against her breast in a possessive hold, her tight 
muscles telling the girl she couldn&#39;t escape. Not that she had any 
thoughts of doing so of course. 

	It would be a while before Kirika was able to sleep, the powerful 
and intoxicating presence of an angry and yet possessive Mireille behind 
her making being calm difficult. Even when she was sure that Mireille 
was asleep, her hold did not loosen, and Kirika fell asleep soon after. 
Wondering how this could be having such an immediate and powerful effect 
on the normally calm and in control Corsican beauty. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Mireille walked behind Kirika, letting for once the small girl 
lead the way and deferring to her direction. Inside she was still angry. 
How could Kirika be so foolish as to give her affections away again? Had 
she not learned with the artist? Damn it, it was just so frustrating. 
And it hurt Mireille too, that she might soon see Kirika in that quiet, 
sad state she had been when the man had died. Though she doubted Kirika 
had been in any romantic relationship with the man.

	That brought another frown to her face, and a troublesome pain in 
her stomach, as if all her muscles were locking at once. She had the 
distinct urge to snarl. Mireille knew what it was. It was jealousy. Pure 
and simple, it was the anger she felt at the thought of Kirika enjoying 
someone else&#39;s company instead of her own. It confused her, as well as 
enraged her. 

	Why the hell was she jealous? Because of want of Kirika? Absurd. 
Because she wanted to keep Kirika to herself?.... Such a selfish desire 
might have a part in it. But maybe..... maybe it was that Mireille 
needed Kirika, she trusted no one else, and maybe Kirika might leave 
her. Leave her alone again so that she couldn&#39;t trust anyone. Despite 
her misgivings the night before, Mireille knew that the life she led now 
was an improvement on her old one. 

	&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Kirika whispered emotionlessly. Mireille looked 
around at the small quaint restaurant. Not bad Mireille had to concede, 
not too fancy but not too shabby either.   

	&quot;So where is she?&quot; Mireille asked in her calmest voice. Kirika 
looked at her, clearly wondering why Mireille had been so determined to 
meet her Friend. Or maybe she could simply sense the violence radiating 
from the blonde. Because Mireille had to concede, she was feeling fairly 
damn violent. 

	&quot;Here.&quot; Kirika said a little louder, indicating a table just next 
to them. At the table was a middle aged woman with dark brown hair and 
slightly tanned skin. She was somewhat plain looking but had nice dark 
green eyes. She smiled at Kirika though somewhat nervously and then at 
Mireille, very nervously. 

	Mireille tried her best to smile back. She really did. 

	&quot;Nice to meet you, I&#39;m Mireille,&quot; She opened, &quot;An assassin.&quot; She 
added as an after thought, smiling inwardly when the woman&#39;s smile 
turned sickly. Though she was disappointed that the woman didn&#39;t run or 
scream.

	&quot;Yeah, I know. My name&#39;s Laura. I&#39;m a psychiatrist...&quot;


	Okay, there is a VERY good reason why I ended this so quickly. 
There really is! And I shall tell you why. It is because the next 
chapter I think should be to itself. As it shall be somewhat of a 
war..... And you know who between....
