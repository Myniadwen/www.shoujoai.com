<h1>Meet the Parent (part 14 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The air was humid and heavy, it smelled like tobacco. The room was dark 
enough it made one felt blinded for a moment. There was neither sound 
nor living being disturbed a sense. Everything was dead quiet.

It took Mireille a while to identify that she was sitting on a chair, 
hands both pulled tight at her back, while her damp feet laid weakly, 
strapped on the chair. Her kidnapper showed neither condolence nor 
sympathy to her, as her wounded left arms pushed ignorantly and 
carelessly by them, leaving full agony on her side, as it was not even 
treated at all.

Slowly, the Corsican girl opened her eyes and shifted her position. The 
blonde inhaled a large amount of air, and vividly smelled some 
carpenters job, before she adapted her eyes to the darkness. The only 
part of her body which was free to move was her eyes, and her mouth. It 
could be consider a fortune that anyone trapped her here decided not to 
blindfold her. Judging from the condition she was in, she knew that it 
would be such a waste of strength if she shouted for help. The room 
looked too large.

With the help of the orange light traces from the window beneath her, 
Mireille could finally catch a hint of where the hell she was. Few blink 
of consciousness, her eyes now wildly wandered through the black room.

Piles of square things like boxes were tugged at every corner, 
captivating her vision completely. Wherever she looked, those boxes were 
somehow visible. Other things beside the boxes in the room were some 
kind of old machines, one placed right beside her, while the other in 
front of her, both blanketed by dark cotton. Boxes, machines, and even 
the tiles below looked old and dusty. More likely, she was trapped in a 
storeroom or a cellar.

Mireille jerked out in surprise from her position as she heard a loud 
bang from the left corner of her room, pretty far from where she was. 
Light came in, and the sound of slammed door gave her ominous feeling, 
much worst the loud chattering of people. She felt her body tensed at 
the time. The perpetrator of her pitiful condition would show their 
self.

Plenty footsteps coming, and Mireille guessed that there were about 
three persons jolted at her way. One of them, with no doubt was Naomi 
from the crisp, light, friendly voice Mireille heard the fake vet&#39;s 
using on her way.

The blonde gritted her teeth. Hearing the voice once again had turned on 
her anger, her grudge. She remembered her huge mistake, her careless 
act. The consequences of being so, without doubt was pretty terrifying 
this time. Instead of worrying about the group approaching slowly toward 
her like before, the blonde felt more worried about her precious partner 
now, Kirika. She remembered that the Japanese girl was already 
unconscious unreasonably the last time she saw her.

Kirika.. Is she alright?

Her thought was disturbed as she could see the group of three had now 
slipped themselves between the figures of machines and boxes near her. 
Their careful act to not slack off with those things made the blonde 
wondered what actually was inside those big boxes.

She watched them as they made their way toward her. The first person she 
saw was Doctor Naomi, as the fake vet halted right in front of Mireille. 
As usual, the fake vet greeted the blonde happily, a wide smile hung on 
her face. The female Soldats&#39; brown eyes twinkling in excitement as she 
looked down at Mireille, her face clearly showed the look of someone 
scorning.

Mireille watched Naomi&#39;s spoiled face and made her eyes looked at the 
female Soldats&#39; upper body. She was surprised to see the fake vet looked 
completely healed from the wound the blonde&#39;s made before, and healthy 
as well. Naomi, noticing the attention the Corscan girl was giving at 
her, raised one of her eyebrows in such proud way it made the blonde 
despised her even more.

Naomi whispered in sarcasm, &quot;Too bad you couldn&#39;t kill me back then.&quot;

Mireille&#39;s eyes widen slightly. She never heard the fake vet talked in a 
very arrogant way like now.

She&#39;s different.

Mireille scowled at the female Soldats coldly and shut her mouth. 
Therefore, in silence she could hear the other persons&#39; chat slowly 
faded as they approached their destination. Two men, both dressed in 
formal black suits glanced briefly at each other, and quicken their 
pace. One men set their position on Mireille&#39;s left, while the other on 
the right. The three of them, including Naomi were now half-circling 
her, cornering her.

The blonde did not recognize the two men as soon as their faces were 
visible. From the way they looked at Naomi, the blonde somehow knew 
right away that they were in a lower position than the fake vet. The 
female Soldats surely had gained some status of honor, whatever it was.

Who is she?

Keeping her cold stare only at the one woman in the group, Mireille 
found her body shaking harshly as her body fighting to resist her killer 
instinct. From the way the trio looked at her in satisfaction, she could 
not help but desired to rip them out from their skin and quickly shot 
them to death, despite how powerless she was already and her helpless 
condition now.

Afterwards, instead of jerking out and made some opposing move to Naomi, 
the blonde felt the very same aching pain from her left arm. She needed 
to calm down. The more she moved, the worst the pain felt.

Her feet felt stiff, her arms felt sore. And to make matters worse, her 
wounded arm seemed like almost in its way to stop functioning properly. 
Even without looking, she knew that there was high possibility of 
infection of her left arm as it had not been cleaned even the slightest 
bit.

&quot;Well, well..&quot; cooed Naomi, laughing. &quot;How do you like your new 
apartment, Mireille?&quot; she mocked, her voice intimidating.

&quot;What are we gonna do with her..?&quot; the fatter one of the two men, with a 
bald head and shorter posture asked abruptly, his voice calm and heavy.

&quot;Why don&#39;t kill her right away?&quot; the other man, looked older with his 
messy gray hair and thick moustache snapped nervously, his hand pointed 
its way at Mireille. &quot;She&#39;s dangerous. She may kill us anytime she got 
the chance.&quot;

&quot;That is indeed true.&quot; said Naomi, throwing her glance at her two 
companions. &quot;But, she will never get the chance to kill us. And do not 
forget that we need her. I suppose you remember why, guys?&quot;

The bald headed man nodded animatedly, his face showed some 
understanding. On the other hand, to Mireille&#39;s surprise, the older one 
of the man looked sharply in disgust and hatred at her. Then, he snorted 
loudly, clearly showing his disagreement.

Mireille looked curiously at the man. She didn&#39;t even recognize his old 
face, but the man now glaring furiously at her, as if holding somewhat 
feeling. Confused, the blonde did not get the chance to think as the 
matter became clear right after the man spoke audibly.

He said, &quot;Don&#39;t ever think I will ever, ever, forgive you.&quot;

Forgive me?

&quot;Frachis, please. Calm down yourself.&quot; whispered Naomi. &quot;Now is not the 
time for your personal problem.&quot;

&quot;But she killed my son! My glorious son! How in hell could I forgive 
that?! YOU&#151;&quot;

And how in hell could I remember or know which man I killed was &#39;your&#39; 
son?

&quot;Franchis!&quot; Naomi stared coldly at the angry man. &quot;I will ask you to 
leave if you continue.&quot;

Franchis stepped back unconsciously, and looked down to her knees. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Madam. I lost my control.&quot;

..Madam?

&quot;I understand.&quot; said Naomi calmly, then glanced back at Mireille.

&quot;..Where&#39;s Kirika, you bitch..?!&quot; Mireille asked in a low voice, hatred 
shown in her tone.

&quot;Kirika? Oh.. Poor Kirika.&quot; Naomi laughed, her mood had astoundingly 
changed. &quot;Who knows where she is..? Silly Kirika..&quot;

Mireille&#39;s glare grew even sharper, her fists clenched and shaking in 
great fury. She realized that this was all she could do to express her 
anger. She could not launch an opposing attack or anything physical at 
all in the state she was in.

Frustrated by how weak she was now, the blonde shifted her position. 
&quot;I&#39;ll ask you again.&quot; She paused dangerously. &quot;Where is she!!?&quot; she 
exclaimed loudly.

&quot;Look what we&#39;ve got here. An angry Mireille? Pitiful creature..&quot; was 
all reply Naomi gave the Corsican girl.

&quot;You fuc&#151;&quot;

SLAP! Mireille&#39;s word was stopped by the rough feeling of her chin being 
slapped by a man&#39;s hand.

&quot;Careful with your mouth.&quot; the bald headed man muttered. His bare hand 
hung on the air for a while before he let it down.

She did not want to admit it, but the slap was pretty much hurting her. 
Not on her chin, but rather her heart. No one ever slapped her that 
rude. She could feel her eyes burning from the feeling of outrage. &quot;You 
fucki&#151;&quot;

The younger man&#39;s fist was already flying in the air when she heard the 
Corsican girl&#39;s utter her coarse word, ready to punch. The blonde&#39;s eyes 
widen bravely to oppose, but suddenly, and fortunately Naomi hold the 
bald headed man&#39;s wide arm with surprising strength, delaying the act 
that was supposed to be directed at the blonde.

&quot;Enough, Martin.&quot; the fake vet&#39;s feminine voice commanded.

&quot;As you please.&quot; the man called Martin lowered her fist, but not her 
gaze at Mireille.

Mireille stared back at the younger man of the two. She had already 
begun to feel like hating the man.

&quot;Now back to business.&quot; Naomi calmly announced, as she made her way to 
touch the Corsican girl&#39;s face.

Mireille jerked out in her position as she was touched ; the female 
Soldats&#39; hand was freezing cold on her face. She shook her head 
forcefully and glared. &quot;Don&#39;t touch me you freaking old bitch! What do 
you want?!&quot;

Naomi chuckled evilly. &quot;Ah. Good question.&quot; She paused for a while. &quot;All 
I want is for you to be dead.&quot;

&quot;Then why don&#39;t you do it now?!&quot; the blonde shouted madly.

The fake vet smiled. &quot;There is a right time for everything.&quot;

Mireille snorted. &quot;Whatever.&quot; she mumbled. &quot;..What did you do to Kirika 
back then?&quot;

Naomi grinned in a way that made the Corsican girl shuddered. &quot;She was 
such a fool. I didn&#39;t know it was so easy to trick her.&quot;

&quot;I ask you, what the hell did you do to her?!&quot;

&quot;I just gave her some kind of drug.&quot; The female Soldats answer, her eyes 
glittered in happiness. &quot;A very useful one.&quot;

Mireille gasped slightly. A drug? How? What kind?

Naomi watched in amusement as Mireille wore her confused expression. 
&quot;She is too much of an addict of tea, don&#39;t you know?&quot;

The blonde gritted her teeth forcefully. &quot;Where. Is. Kirika. Now?!&quot; she 
asked slowly and clearly.

&quot;You have no need to know.&quot; retorted the fake vet. &quot;She is alive, and 
that much I am kind enough to tell you.&quot;

The Corsican girl scowled in disgust. &quot;If you dare to hurt her, or touch 
her, or&#151;&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; the female Soldats shouted. &quot;You do not have the right to 
tell me what to do. Remember it well.&quot; she stated.

&quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; Mireille&#39;s blue eyes met with Naomi. &quot;You will pay for 
everything.&quot; She accused, somehow in a brave and challenging tone.

Naomi laughed hysterically at the Corsican girl&#39;s word. Strangely, she 
walked closer to Mireille, and showed her long finger nails right in 
front the blonde&#39;s eyes. Then, without any further talk, she scratched 
her sharp nails along Mireille&#39;s soft chin slowly, somehow causing deep 
red bloody mark along the blonde&#39;s delicate chin.

Mireille grunted. The fake vet&#39;s nails were extremely painful and sharp 
as it scratched deeply in Mireille&#39;s skin. She was about to move her 
body and shook her head just like before, if not a glimpse at Naomi&#39;s 
face made her stop.

The Corsican girl&#39;s eyes widen in horror. The female Soldats looked like 
possessed ; her brown eyes stared blankly as she moved. Her mouth curled 
a wide grin, as if enjoying what she was doing, which is scratching 
using her own nails. The fake vet was impassive, but at the same time 
seemed to be pleasant and happy.

Mireille could not help but shuddered at the view. Suddenly, Naomi 
laughed loudly one more time in full satisfaction, which made the 
Corsican girl jumped slightly in surprise. Laughing and grinning with no 
clear reason, Naomi had jolted her way to the blonde&#39;s right side, ready 
to leave another mark on Mireille&#39;s other chin.

While recognizing the nails tickling on her chin, Mireille felt her body 
suddenly felt cold, and heavy. The nails move up and own in a straight 
line on her chin. It was pretty much hurt, after a while. But still, all 
the scratch was nothing compared to the glowing, haunted aura she 
received and felt from Naomi.

The fake vet surely enjoyed her little, torturing act from the sadism 
look on her face. Still laughing crazily, Naomi traveled the blonde&#39;s 
cheek with her nails, making scratch all the way.

&quot;How about paying with my beautiful fingernails? Hmm?? Mireille?&quot; Naomi 
whispered dangerously, her voice somehow sounded threatening for the 
blonde.

Noticing the now scary and painful touch, Mireille neither dared to look 
nor to steal a glance at Naomi. Or even gave a reply. The very existence 
beside her had succeeded at scaring her. Especially the possessed cold 
eyes.

In the middle of her perilous situation, the blonde somehow took 
advantage to see the men standing beside her, from the corner of her 
eye. Judging from the look they had on their face, they were also 
freaked out by Naomi&#39;s strange and sudden weird act.

To Mireille&#39;s surprise and relief, a minute later she found Naomi had 
done tormenting her, and now smiling casually at her, as if she had not 
done anything. When Naomi moved to her place from before, the Corsican 
girl heaved out her breath in great relief ; she had unconsciously kept 
her breath all along the way when the strange Naomi was beside her.

What&#39;s wrong with her?!? She freaked me out!

&quot;Why did.. Why did you do that?&quot; Mireille asked slowly, her voice 
somehow cracked by fear.

The female Soldats continued to smile enigmatically, and did not give 
her answer.

Mireille decided not to ask more. Not that she wanted to know, too. She 
looked up, and asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

Naomi chuckled. &quot;Me?&quot; she whispered in a low voice. &quot;You used to call me 
Doctor Naomi, didn&#39;t you? So, I am Naomi. And of course,&quot; she paused and 
sharpen her stare. &quot;Soldats.&quot;

Ignoring the answer that did not quite answer her question, Mireille 
inhaled quietly in relief. She sighed at the thought of Naomi would kill 
her back then. A long silence stretched between them. No one made a 
move, or spoke a word afterwards.

Then, slowly regaining her composure by the time that had long passed, 
Mireille asked tentatively, &quot;..What do you want from me and Kirika?&quot;

Naomi&#39;s smile grew wider. &quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot; she said. &quot;Even your friend 
Chloe doesn&#39;t know all the details.&quot;

&quot;..&quot;

Naomi laughed loudly. &quot;She is such a smart bastard. Smart, but not smart 
enough. She thinks she can make you escape from me, huh?&quot;

Mireille was completely confused, but decided to shut her mouth. It 
seemed that Naomi had begun to become talkative, to the Corsican girl&#39;s 
relief. Any other personality was better but the freaking, horrible, 
sadist creature from before.

&quot;Altena had tortured her, you know?&quot; she pointed one of her finger at 
Mireille. &quot;All because she wanted to protect Kirika.&quot;

Mireille remained as quiet as a rock, and listened.

Naomi shot a look of anger at the blonde. &quot;She risked her life to tell 
you what she knew, didn&#39;t she? She is a traitor. She&#39;s supposed to help 
us in this plan, and not the opposite.&quot; Abruptly, Naomi&#39;s voice turned 
to a happy tone. &quot;But her stubbornness had helped us. Her part of 
telling you the information was also included in my plan.&quot;

At this, the Corsican girl&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;..What?!&quot;

Naomi grinned in victory. &quot;It was easier for us to capture you while you 
are in a state of confusion. Especially, Kirika. Both your acts were 
reckless all the time.&quot; She paused. &quot;I almost couldn&#39;t bear to hold off 
the laughter of you two! Both of you gave me too many silly openings.&quot;

&quot;What makes me still laughing out loud until now,&quot; she continued. &quot;Is 
that you guys believe me as a vet, and as Kirika&#39;s mother.&quot;

&quot;You bastard.&quot;

Naomi continued proudly. &quot;It was such a miracle to me that Chloe didn&#39;t 
kill me that time. It was all thanks to you and Kirika, too.&quot;

She&#39;s evil.

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Naomi muttered softly, &quot;That you are completely fooled by 
my face, my story, my proof, and all, right?&quot;

&quot;Your face..&quot; mumbled the blonde. &quot;Surgery?&quot; she ventured.

&quot;Surgery, it is. You are quite smart.&quot;

At the compliment, Mireille otherwise felt really stupid. Felt helpless, 
she looked at her surrounding. Two rude men, one scary woman were half 
circling her, all because she was too careless then captured. Kirika was 
also nowhere to see. She herself was badly exhausted and wounded. She 
lost to Soldats.

She failed to protect Kirika.

As her mind brought up the happy memory with her lovers, her delayed 
peaceful moment with the Japanese girl, her wasted time so far just to 
think about Soldats, all things Soldats had done to herself and Kirika, 
Mireille felt her anger rise, exceeding her self pity or anything.

&quot;Why did you do that far?!&quot; Mireille exclaimed suddenly in a high voice. 
The three Soldats, pretty surprised from their silly expression, fully 
paid their attention at her this time. &quot;What for?!&quot;

The fake vet smiled calmly. &quot;You will know later.&quot;

Pretty annoyed, Mireille shouted, &quot;Answer me, Naomi!&quot;

&quot;Poor Mireille..&quot; Naomi mumbled happily. &quot;After all, it was thanks to 
all your effort that all things were easy.&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;Kirika 
was much more of a help. Innocent, stupid, easy to fool, animals addict, 
stubborn, intr&#150;&quot;

&quot;STOP TALKING ABOUT HER LIKE YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS!&quot; Mireille exclaimed in 
outrage, now glaring at Naomi, who seemed entirely startled to suddenly 
be shouted at.

The Corsican had had enough of self pity, and now despised anyone who 
pitied her, and even more, anyone who pitied, or said anything wrong 
about Kirika. She could not accept anyone talking in a negative way 
about Kirika.

Very especially, Naomi.

She did not hold back her feeling anymore, and went out rampage. She 
shook and moved all her body&#39;s part forcefully. She stretched all muscle 
of her body, trying to get off of the things that bind and keeping her 
still. She felt the stinging pain from her left arm, crying for her to 
stop moving, but she did not care.

Therefore with her full attempt, Mireille dropped on the floor hardly, 
along with her chair and with the very still same stuff bind her on it. 
It was unfortunate that the chair was strong enough it did not break to 
pieces. Mireille struggled to let go, to be freed from the string on her 
wrist, from the chair, from this situation.

Then, she heard laughter from the three person right in front of her. 
They were laughing at her.

Mireille felt mad. She had come to notice her useless effort on the 
chair by now. Soldats had greatly trapped her completely on the chair. 
But Mireille was not a person to give up easily.

She tried with all her might to approach Naomi, along with her body 
stuck to the chair. Snuggling and sneaking on the cold dusty tiles on 
the floor, the blonde finally got closer to the fake vet&#39;s after some 
time. Looking up, she could see Naomi was standing right in front of her 
in utter satisfaction, laughing happily, her eyes staring down at 
&#39;Mireille with her chair&#39; on the floor.

&quot;What are you doing, slug?&quot; the female Soldats asked mockingly, 
laughing. The sound of laughter of the two men joined her words 
afterwards. &quot;Dancing?&quot;

In the middle of all laughter she was rewarded, regardless of how silly 
and ridiculous the act would be, Mireille bit Naomi&#39;s bare leg down her 
skirt.

&quot;Arrghhh!!!&quot; The latter stopped her laugh and screamed in a high voice 
right after. She jumped back in horror, particularly shocked and 
surprised to feel the blonde&#39;s teeth on her skin.

She ignored Naomi&#39;s shouting, the fierce little hands on her face, 
trying to stop her act. She hung steadily like a worm in a leaf, like a 
dog who bit the leg of a culprit. She deeply attached her teeth on the 
skin, and bit the leg with all her strength. She bit deeper and deeper.

It worked. Naomi looked startled, and definitely pained.

And it was not until Franchis and Martin both slapped, punched, and 
pulling her not too long after that Mireille let go from the female 
Soldats&#39; leg.

Mireille was thrown harshly by the bald headed man to the other side, 
along with her firm chair, away from Naomi. The two man helped her sat 
properly for some reason after some time, in great vigilance. The 
Corsican girl did not bite them, and let them helped her. Ignoring her 
pained back, she never let go the eye contact of Naomi. There was a huge 
red mark of teeth bite on Naomi&#39;s leg. Her teeth had almost ripped out 
the skin of the female Soldats&#39; leg, as the mark was red and deep enough 
to assume the pain. Mireille smiled. She felt satisfied of her act. 
Despite all punches, slaps, and forceful act she received, she felt a 
little light in feeling, and happier.

She had hurt Naomi. She had made a scar, at least. Even Franchis and 
Martin did not dare to move closer to her.

Still on the floor, Mireille had not even lost her continuous stare at 
Naomi. She glared at her, eyes glinting in strong determination and 
bravery to oppose Soldats.

Naomi dragged her feet up quickly, and walked her way to Mireille 
slowly, this time more cautious than she had ever. &quot;Pretty brutal and 
aggressive, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Mireille had no will to answer and shut her mouth.

&quot;You are lucky that I still have need of you.&quot; scorned Naomi. &quot;Or else 
I&#39;ll kill you myself. Right now.&quot;

Mireille kept her glare still at the now sweaty, angry Asian face. &quot;Why 
don&#39;t you just get out of here?&quot; she said sharply, and found herself 
surprised at her own words.

Naomi looked appalled. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare to get all cocky just because 
that small crap you did, Mireille.&quot; She halted then added coldly. &quot;Your 
life is in my own hand.&quot;

The blonde once again kept silence, before said, &quot;I will never let 
myself be killed.&quot;

&quot;Hmph.&quot; The female Soldats grunted. &quot;You will see. Tomorrow.&quot;

Mireille did not reply anything and only scowled at Naomi.

&quot;Be ready for your own death ceremony tomorrow, Mireille Bouquet.&quot; Naomi 
stated with a smirk on her face. &quot;A very special ceremony only for you.&quot;</pre>
