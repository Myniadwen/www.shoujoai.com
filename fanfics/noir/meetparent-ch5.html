fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Mireille wasn&#39;t sure whether her instinct was right or not. She didn&#39;t 
know why, but in her opinion, Kirika would just look like the girl in 
the photo if she was on her 3. And also, the fact that the girl had big 
brown eyes and curly brown hair increased the similarity point.

If that&#39;s true, why does Dr. Naomi have it..?

Suddenly the blonde remembered Chloe&#39;s words that she was the one who 
supposed to kill that female vet. &quot;It wasn&#39;t me who suppose to kill her. 
Rather, it&#39;s you.&quot; The blonde reminded herself that she must talk to 
Chloe the next time they would see each other.

While Mireille was busy in her own thought, Kirika was trying to play 
with her fluffy white cat, Adeline. The one who gave the name was 
obviously Kirika, though it was still a mystery why did she come up with 
such name. The truth was, pet were forbidden in the apartment. But 
thanks to Adeline&#39;s ability to become quiet in time, they didn&#39;t get in 
trouble so far. Because in fact the cat was barely did another 
activities besides sleeping and eating. No wonder Adeline was fat and 
looked like a ball.

Kirika sighed, &quot;She fell asleep again.&quot;

Mireille glanced at Kirika and smiled slightly. &quot;That cat surely enough 
live a lazy and easy life.&quot;

Kirika closed Adeline&#39;s cage door. It was useless to do it tough, 
because the cat was barely go outside its cage. The brunette stood up 
and walked to the window, and as usual stared at the sky.

&quot;Don&#39;t you make some tea today..?&quot; Mireille asked, as she jumped on the 
pool table.

Kirika turned her back and said softly, &quot;We don&#39;t have the stock.&quot;

&quot;You mean the tea?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

The blonde smiled cheerfully, &quot;Let&#39;s go buy it, then..!&quot; She jumped off 
from the pool table. &quot;I&#39;ll change first.&quot;

Kirika waited as she continued to stare at the sky. A while after, 
Mireille stepped out from her bedroom, wearing her red tank top and 
black mini skirt. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; she said.

It was morning when they went to the nearest supermarket to buy the tea. 
After they bought it, Mireille&#39;s habit took over. They went in and out 
to some boutiques and shops, tried lots of clothes, and so on.

Just in a short time when they arrived in a boutique, the blonde had 
decided what and which to buy. While the blonde was paying, Kirika 
usually wandered around in the shop.

&quot;Kirika..?&quot; the blonde asked, as she carried up some paper bags which 
full of her new clothes.

Heard that her name was called, Kirika walked towards Mireille and 
carried some of the paper bags.

As time passed by, more and more paper bags which they had to carry. 
Almost all of them were Mireille&#39;s. The blonde had bought so much which 
would make it difficult to count. Actually Kirika tried the clothes, 
too. But the Japanese girl didn&#39;t buy any of one she tried, despite the 
blonde&#39;s offering. Still unsatisfied, Mireille decided to go to another 
boutique. The two continued their shopping journey again and again which 
was tiring, especially for the brunette.

Finally they ended their journey with having dinner in a restaurant. 
Full of pride, Mireille carried the bags inside the restaurant. Kirika 
obediently carried the bag, as she remained expressionless. Sometimes 
Mireille habit could be out of place and became absurd. Both Kirika and 
Mireille didn&#39;t notice all the stares from the other customer, tough. 
They were given a &quot;they-are-travelers&quot; stare, despite the fact that both 
of them were not really a traveler who was crazy at shopping. It was 
just a habit of Mireille, after all. After they finished with the food, 
they returned to the apartment in exhaustion, especially for Kirika who 
carried more bags than Mireille.

&quot;I&#39;ll go take a bath.&quot; Mireille said, as she placed all the paper bags 
on her hands to the floor. The blonde walked cheerfully to the bathroom 
while humming a song. It seemed that shopping really made the blonde 
happy.

Kirika carried all the bags to the bedroom. Then, she went to the 
kitchen and made some tea. As she finished making the tea, she placed 
the tea pot on the table and waited for Mireille to join her and drank 
their tea together. While she was waiting, Kirika once again stared at 
the sky. The sky was getting dark, as night came by. Though the moon 
hadn&#39;t showed up, lamps on the street had lit the way on the road which 
made the night became bright enough.

Minutes passed and Mireille finally had done bathing. She wrapped the 
towel on her body, and walked out from the bathroom. Mireille opened the 
bathroom&#39;s door. When the blonde stepped outside, she saw that Kirika 
was as usual staring at the sky. When the brunette heard the sound of an 
unlocked door, she turned her back and saw the blonde. Then a strange 
event happened. Whether it was just imagination or not, Mireille could 
swear that she saw Kirika&#39;s cheeks turned red. But a second after, the 
brunette walked over to the bathroom, passing the blonde as she said 
nothing, while her face returned to her usual expressionless state. 
Then, there was a sound of a door closing. Mireille just stood still, as 
she still was confused with the unusual change of facial expression from 
Kirika, which seemed unbelievably true.

Did she... just flush..?

Mireille raised her eyebrows. Impossible. It must be my imagination.

The blonde then walked to her bedroom and changed to pyjamas. As she 
finished dressing up, she sat herself on the chair in front of her 
laptop. Now that she wasn&#39;t doing any shopping, she thought about other 
things. The blonde stared seriously to her laptop screen, tough her mind 
was going somewhere else. Mireille tried to remember all the action that 
had happened recently. A bird was wounded. Kirika bought a cat. A visit 
from Chloe, as she left confusing words about the female vet. Dr. Naomi 
was injured and then, kidnapped. Mireille found a photo of a little girl 
that resembled Kirika so much, in her opinion. As the blonde remembered 
the details more, her suspicion towards Dr. Naomi became bigger. It was 
as if all of the events were plotted, especially the one which consists 
Dr. Naomi in it. Who is she..?

Suddenly there was a sound of someone knocking. Mireille walked to open 
the door. When she had opened it up, she saw the familiar female vet&#39;s 
doctor was smiling brightly.

&quot;Hey there..!&quot; the doctor said.

&quot;Hi, Dr. Naomi. Nice to see you again.&quot; Mireille didn&#39;t show her 
surprise at all and greeted Dr. Naomi as usual.

&quot;Nice to see you too, Mireille.&quot; Dr. Naomi then picked up a white paper 
bag from the floor, and showed it to Mireille. &quot;Here are the clothes I 
borrow from you back then.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you.&quot; Mireille said as she took the paper bag.

Just then, Kirika showed up from the bathroom&#39;s door. Kirika seemed to 
have finished bathing, tough she wore her clothes from before, as she 
must have heard someone&#39;s coming. &quot;Good evening, Dr. Naomi.&quot; the 
brunette&#39;s greeted the doctor.

&quot;Hi there, Kirika.&quot; Dr. Naomi said, as she smiled.

Mireille looked at Dr. Naomi and asked, &quot;Do you want to come inside..?&quot;

&quot;My pleasure.&quot;

Mireille and Dr. Naomi walked in to the apartment, while Kirika silently 
walked to the bedroom to change her clothes. As the brunette was about 
to open the bedroom&#39;s door, she turned her back and said in a soft 
little voice, &quot;You can drink the tea.&quot; After that, the brunette stepped 
into the bedroom.

There was already a pot of tea and two cups on the table. Mireille 
walked to the kitchen to take one more cup for Dr. Naomi. She raised her 
hand and took one cup from the upper cupboard. As the blonde was about 
to leave the kitchen,

&quot;I guess you have already suspicious on me.&quot; Dr. Naomi said, while her 
usual smile was still hanging on her face.

Mireille tried her best not to act startled, and hold the cup on her 
hand tightly. Since when has she been behind me..?!

The blonde turned her back. &quot;What do you mean..?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s about time you realized.&quot; Dr. Naomi said calmly.

&quot;Who are you..?&quot; Mireille asked coldly, as she raised her gun to Dr. 
Naomi. It was fortunate that the blonde coincidentally still kept the 
gun with her. The blonde stared at the woman after her, as she became 
more cautious and slowly stepped backward.

Dr. Naomi said softly, &quot;I&#39;m not your enemy, Mireille. And I&#39;m no one you 
have to be cautious of.&quot;

Mireille didn&#39;t give a slight reaction to this, and her eyes reflected 
some disbelief. Dr. Naomi kept her smiling face and did nothing, while 
Mireille still pointed her gun to the female&#39;s vet.

Suddenly Kirika&#39;s voice was heard from the main room, calling out the 
blonde&#39;s name. &quot;Mireille?&quot;

The blonde had a feeling that it would be better to not involve Kirika. 
Mireille aware of her situation now and lowered her gun. &quot;I will let you 
be this time.&quot; she said, as she turned back and walked.

&quot;Wait.&quot; Dr. Naomi said in serious tone. &quot;We can talk tomorrow at my 
clinic, after lunch.&quot;

Mireille gave a cold stare at Dr. Naomi. A few seconds later she said, 
&quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t bring Kirika with you.&quot; Dr. Naomi almost whispered when 
saying this.

Mireille glanced at Dr. Naomi and said, &quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;

The blonde was just bluffing. It was definitely her business and Dr. 
Naomi now, and Kirika was not yet be the part. Tough she had to think 
how she could leave alone without the brunette.

Mireille walked to the table and saw Kirika was drinking her tea. As 
both Mireille and Dr. Naomi approached the table, the Japanese-looking 
girl glanced at them.

&quot;Let&#39;s drink tea together.&quot; Kirika whispered softly, and smiled.

Mireille and Dr. Naomi then sat down. Mireille gave the cup to Dr. Naomi 
and Kirika poured the tea for all of them. Then, they started talking. 
Mireille tried her best to avoid contact with Dr. Naomi. Despite it, it 
was a friendly chat the three of them had. Dr. Naomi stayed for a little 
more chit-chat with them until about 9 p.m, and went home after. The two 
of them bid farewell to Dr. Naomi and went back to the apartment.

After the female vet left, Mireille once again sat in front of her 
laptop. But unusually, Kirika didn&#39;t stare at the sky. The blonde 
noticed that Kirika had been staring at her from the window. Mireille 
completely tried to ignore the brunette&#39;s gaze and drew her attention to 
the laptop screen. When it came to sixth senses, the Japanese girl 
surely had the skill.

Kirika gazed continuosly at the blonde, with emotion no one can predict. 
Mireille on the other hand, had to try her best to look as natural, and 
as usual as she could. The stare she received was enough to make some 
sweat dropped. It was neither a cold nor a warm stare. It was just.. 
sharp. Time passed by as both of the two positions remained still the 
same and no words were said. Unfortunately, it was Mireille&#39;s loss when 
it came to situation like this.

Mireille tried to be as natural as possible and looked at Kirika. &quot;Do 
you need something..?&quot;

Kirika said emotionless, &quot;Nothing.&quot;

The blonde replied, &quot;Oh.&quot; She looked away from Kirika and focused her 
gaze at the laptop screen.

Kirika just seemed like she enjoyed staring at Mireille, as she fixed 
her gaze more intensively upon Mireille. Deep inside her heart, the 
blonde was kind of suffering. The brunette was completely tried to shut 
Mireille&#39;s mouth no longer. Kirika knew Mireille was hiding something. 
The Japanese girl was now standing not too far from Mireille, while kept 
her stare still.

The Corsican girl realized that the closer the brunette&#39;s with her, the 
more panic she became. Not to mention that Kirika&#39;s stare was getting 
more and more sharp.

As she cannot bear the pressure, Mireille sighed and said, &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll 
tell you.&quot;

It was unfortunate that the blonde couldn&#39;t bear to hide something from 
her partner. It only needed an unstoppable gaze from Kirika to make 
Mireille split out everything. Mireille realized it, and somewhat felt 
embarrassed with it.

&quot; To short it up, I kind of feel that Dr. Naomi was lying to us.&quot; said 
Mireille. &quot;And just when she came tonight, she said that it&#39;s time for 
me to realize something. She also asked me to come to her clinic 
tomorrow.&quot;

Kirika had been beside the blonde now and listened carefully to 
Mireille, as she remained silent as a picture.

&quot;Without you.&quot; The blonde fixed her blue eyes toward the brown pair one 
in front of her when she said that. Mireille stated it seriously, in 
order to make it clear for Kirika that it was her business.

Kirika whispered, &quot;And?&quot;

Mireille thought about what to do next. The last sentence was meant that 
the Japanese girl couldn&#39;t come with her. She looked at Kirika, just to 
see that the brunette was smiling cutely.

&quot;You can&#39;t come.&quot; Mireille said as she tried to calm herself. She felt 
her body heat was increased.

&quot;...&quot; Kirika said nothing in return.

The blonde felt relieved that Kirika didn&#39;t offense her decision. 
Mireille then glanced at Kirika. She saw that the brunette&#39;s face was 
down, and she wore a melancholy expression. It was hard to tell, but 
Mireille was sure that it was a sad expression. Despite the melancholy, 
Mireille blushed at her thought that Kirika&#39;s expression was pretty 
adorable.

&quot;Don&#39;t wear that expression, please..&quot; said the blonde softly. She 
sighed and looked at Kirika. &quot;Guess you&#39;ll come, too..&quot;

Kirika looked up. &quot;Okay.&quot; she said in a sweet adorable tone. The 
Japanese-looking girl had no longer remained in her melancholy state. 
Rather, the brunette was now smiling cheerfully to the blonde as if she 
was never sad in the first place.

Mireille looked away from Kirika, hiding her cheeks which turned red. 
The blonde had now realized that Kirika was not an expressionless girl. 
Mireille admitted it honestly that Kirika was mysteriously a master at 
controlling her own expression.</pre>
