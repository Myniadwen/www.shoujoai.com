<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 2 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Kirika is obviously going to be OOC, but that&#39;s due to the drug, so 
technically she is still in character. Mireille should be normal. If she 
could ever be classed as normal. 

	But enough blabbering!


&quot;That Age.&quot;


	Mireille yawned as the light filtered through the windows and 
struck her face at an unpleasant angle. Damn it, should have closed the 
curtains. She moaned to herself, attempting to roll over. Unfortunately 
Kirika seemed to be clinging rather tightly to her this morning. 
Practically latched onto Mireille&#39;s back. Damn.

	It happened every night of course. They would sleep in the same 
bed, but apart from each other, and then in the night their bodies would 
unconsciously seek the warmth that the other offered. It happened, but 
normally they were just laying against each other. But this morning? 
Mireille took stock of her position.

	Kirika was pressed up against her back, her arms wrapped 
possessively around Mireille&#39;s stomach and her face pressed into the 
crook of her neck. Even her legs, were wrapped around Mireille&#39;s own. 
Mireille was very warm. But as cute as this show of affection was, and 
make no mistake, it was very cute. Mireille was uncomfortable and 
somewhat embarrassed, and the day had to begin. 

	At least it seemed that Kirika had taken no lasting effects from 
the strange drugs last night. (The author laughs evilly, but ends up 
just sounding like a deranged fool.) So that was some small blessing. 
	
	Mireille was about to wake Kirika up when a bitter smell reached 
her delicate nostrils. Making her inhale the sickly sweet scent in 
confusion. Before her eyes widened and her mouth opened in shock. She 
suddenly noticed a sticky wet feeling on her upper thigh. 

	Kirika yelped as Mireille bucked wildly, sending the just awakened 
Kirika tumbling off the bed, even as Mireille jumped to her feet and ran 
to the kitchen.  Oh my god! Mireille&#39;s mind screamed at her, as her hand 
snatched a kitchen towel and began scrubbing her leg madly. OH MY GOD! 
It screamed again. She couldn&#39;t think right now. All she knew was this 
couldn&#39;t be happening. Kirika had... she&#39;d just... 

	Don&#39;t think. Scrub. The rational part of her mind commanded. She 
washed away all traces of the stuff from her leg and washed it again 
just to make sure. Have pity on her. She&#39;s a teenager. She&#39;s at that 
age. It was perfectly normal. Just a wet dream. She didn&#39;t mean it. 
Mireille let out a suffering sigh as she placed the towel back on the 
side and turned back to their shared bed. 

	The bedsheets would have to go, she thought as she looked for 
Kirika. The girl was nowhere to be seen, though she could hear the 
shower blasting away loudly from the bathroom. At least she realised, 
and is embarrassed. She said to herself. She didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d have 
done if Kirika hadn&#39;t realised. How would she have explained it. 

	Half an hour later and Mireille was drinking tea whilst checking 
her e-mail accounts on the internet. They had not mentioned anything 
about what had happened that morning. Though Kirika would not meet 
Mireille&#39;s eyes. In turn Mireille tried to treat it as if it had never 
happened. Perhaps it would be better that way. 

	Sighing Mireille rose to her feet and stretched her arms high 
above her head, trying to get rid of stiffness. She felt eyes on her.

	Turning she glanced at Kirika, whose eyes were wide and rapt. 
Staring straight at Mireille. She was sitting stock till, her tea 
seemingly forgotten in her hand. 

	&quot;Kirika?&quot; She asked, and the girl startled, blushed then took a 
long sip of her tea. Not answering. Shrugging at the odd behaviour 
Mireille sat down again and began typing on her keyboard. Accessing some 
more accounts. She found an e-mail from last night&#39;s client and opened 
it. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled. She turned.

	Kirika again was staring at her, her mouth open slightly and her 
eyes fixed on Mireille&#39;s form. The gaze was unnerving and Mireille 
blushed slightly, suddenly becoming self-conscious.

	&quot;What? What is it? Do I have something on me?&quot; She asked quickly, 
checking her pyjamas, which consisted of her loose shirt, for any 
stains. Kirika shook her head quickly, but not breaking her stare. 

	&quot;No, you&#39;re beautiful.&quot; She replied, then suddenly heard what 
she&#39;d just said and squeaked, blushing and not meeting Mireille&#39;s 
shocked eyes. Right... Turning back with a blush staining her own cheeks 
Mireille decided to ignore her partner&#39;s strangeness. She checked the 
date, 1st of may, alright, she&#39;d have to remember that as a day where 
Kirika lost her marbles. 

	She went back to her e-mail, reading the reply to her inquiry into 
the drug. Her mouth began to drop and she quickly swallowed. Turning 
away and glancing at Kirika. She was staring again, her lips parted and 
her breathing loud. Unconsciously the small girl licked her lips.  
Mireille turned back to the screen and re-read the last paragraph.

	The drug, Merophoxyll, is in simple terms a variation on love 
potions sold at old fairs. It is similar in kind to the drug Viagra, in 
that it stimulates sexual lust in the taker. However the effects of 
Merophoxyll were known to be far longer lasting, nigh permanent, and the 
drug had the unpredictable effect of making the taker lust after the 
first person it saw. Making it unpredictable and potentially dangerous. 
It would allow people to force others to love them, and as such we had 
to destroy it.

	If what you tell us is true, then your friend will be in a state 
not unlike heat in an animal. All focused at the first person it saw. 

	Mireille&#39;s eye twitched. Heat...., at the first thing it sees?.... 
Oh God! All of a sudden as she noticed Kirika&#39;s stare again, she wished 
she was wearing more than just her loose fitting shirt and her 
underwear. 


	Right..... I&#39;m very strange I know. But this idea for a fic came 
to me in a very humorous dream and I couldn&#39;t resist writing it.
