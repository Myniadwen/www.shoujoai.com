<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The sound of chill wind was kind of broke the silence between the two. 
Kirika whispered a word which was definitely ran chill down on 
Mireille&#39;s spine.

&quot;Chloe.&quot;

Kirika hold the knife in her hand tightly. Just a second after, she put 
it silently into her skirt&#39;s pocket. She even didn&#39;t bother to clean up 
the blood mess on the knife.

Mireille had already lowered her gun. She knew that the situation 
hopefully, would be under control. After all, it was Chloe they were 
talking about. Mireille knew the most that Chloe would never let anyone 
hurt Kirika.

&quot;Why Chloe was here..?&quot;

The blonde was kind of busy with her thought, but a second after the 
blonde decided to think about Chloe later.

The day had become darker now, which really made it difficult for the 
two to see each other face, and also the path. Desire to just go home 
were running inside Mireille&#39;s mind. Unfortunately, her curiousity won 
the best of her. Kirika gazed emotionless to Mireille&#39;s face, as if 
waited for something to be said.

&quot;Let&#39;s move on.&quot; Mireille finally said, while pulled out her gun, once 
more.

Kirika did the same, and they proceeded to investigate the matter. 
Carefully they sneaked within darkness in silence, as expected from 
professional assassins. It was really dark, especially because the moon 
barely lit the way where they were. It was also difficult to see 
anything, so both Mireille and Kirika had to rely on their instinct the 
best for this time.

&quot;A... ny...body...&quot; a weak small voice was barely heard.

Despite the darkness within, Mireille glanced toward Kirika. The 
Japanese girl gave no reaction and remained silent as ever.

&quot;He... help..&quot; said the same voice from before.

Kirika moved first and walked ahead this time. Mireille followed her, as 
she hold her gun tightly. A few step after, Kirika stopped walking 
abruptly. She stopped to because she saw something in front of her. 
Mireille walked forward, and stood beside Kirika. They saw a woman was 
laying down half-consciously. The woman&#39;s eyes were closed, and she was 
trembling. The woman&#39;s long curly black hair which covered her face was 
also in a mess.

&quot;Who... who&#39;s there...?&quot; the woman&#39;s shaking voice broke the silence. 
Altough she was shaking, she still had some guts to talk to them, who 
was unknown to her.

Mireille decided to approach the woman and said calmly, &quot;We will not 
hurt you unless you made suspicious move.&quot; Her gun was still rested 
inside her palm, waited patiently to be used by its owner.

The woman didn&#39;t reply anything.

It was then that Mireille somehow realized that the woman was badly 
injured on the shoulder. There was no sign of knife cutting from her 
body. Rather, it seemed that she was badly kicked and punched by 
somebody and accidentally hit herself to the stone wall beside. The 
woman was just injured, no more. Neither rapped, nor her belongings were 
stolen.

The woman was trembling much more after heard what Mireille said. A few 
second after, she made a little move and slowly opened her eyes. It was 
when the woman looked up at Mireille that the blonde gasped. She saw the 
woman&#39;s face clearly, despite the darkness.

&quot;Doctor Naomi..?&quot;

Kirika had stood beside Mireille as she said no words.

&quot;Oh.. It&#39;s you.&quot; Dr. Naomi said with a weak tone. She tried to smile, 
tough it didn&#39;t work.

Dr. Naomi tried to stand up herself, but failed. Just in time when Dr. 
Naomi would hit her head to the floor, Kirika caught her. The Japanese 
girl then tried to sit the doctor down. Both Kirika and Mireille were 
kind of astonished to see Dr. Naomi this way. Plus, the female vet was 
barely conscious. Her appearance was not much better. Her clothing was 
ripped, and dirty.

&quot;We have to help her, Kirika. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Mireille said. &quot;To our 
apartment.&quot;

She placed Dr. Naomi&#39;s left arm on her shoulder, while Kirika carried 
the other one on her shoulder, too.

Fortunately, they didn&#39;t encounter enemies on their way back. Not even 
Chloe showed herself. They finally managed to get to the apartment 
safely. Dr. Naomi was now laying on their bed. While Mireille undressed 
Dr. Naomi&#39;s, Kirika searched the cabinet for fresh bandages and 
medicines. A few minutes later, the doctor&#39;s cloths were changed into 
clean ones, and her wound was treated. Tough Dr. Naomi had remained 
unconscious since their way back, her wound seemed that it wouldn&#39;t be a 
threat for her life. It didn&#39;t take much time for Kirika and Mireille to 
realize that the vet was no longer on her unconscious state, but fell 
asleep.

Kirika walked out of her bedroom. Not too long after that, Mireille 
followed her.

&quot;I will make tea.&quot; the brunette said as she headed to the kitchen.

Mireille sat herself on the pool table. She closed her eyes. In order to 
think properly, the blonde did so. While she was busy focusing her mind, 
a soft voice whispered, &quot;It&#39;s ready.&#39;

Mireille opened her blue eyes slowly, and walked to the little table 
where Kirika had already sat in. Both of them enjoy their tea, and drank 
it slowly.

&quot;Hmm..delicious, what is this..?&quot; the blonde pointed at the tea.

Kirika smiled, &quot;It&#39;s called milk tea.&quot;

&quot;Oh..&quot; Mireille sipped her tea one more time, then grinned, &quot;You&#39;re good 
at this stuff, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Just after it, the blonde looked away to the window. She didn&#39;t notice 
that Kirika flushed a bit the moment the brunette heard the words.

Suddenly they heard someone was knocking. It was obviously not the time 
to welcome some guests, especially at this late of night. Mireille and 
Kirika glanced at each other. They nodded at the same time. Kirika ran 
to the left side of the door, while Mireille ran to the right. They 
would stop the unknown guest&#39;s move at the time Mireille opened up the 
door. Mireille opened the door slowly, and..

&quot;Meooww..!&quot; a cat blurted in. Mireille and Kirika could see clearly that 
there was a fluffy white cat in front of them. It was Kirika&#39;s cat, no 
doubt. It was the one they bought at the pet shop today. The cat was 
totally forgotten. None of the two remembered to bring the cat to the 
house, after what happened after they bought it. Both Kirika and 
Mireille were staying behind the cat, with both guns were still pointed 
to the air.

There was someone else besides the cat. The person was a kid which wore 
a green cloak. From the face, one could know that the person was a girl. 
As a kid, she was not taller than Mireille. No gesture was made by her. 
She just stood still, tough she was obviously staring on Mireille and 
Kirika. All her life, Mireille just knew one person that resembled this 
person in front of her. No one else but Chloe.

Realized that she had been acknowledged by Mireille and Kirika, Chloe 
smiled mysteriously, &quot;Long time no see.&quot; Now she was no longer staring 
at them like a statue.

Mireille pointed her gun directly at Chloe, instead of lowered it like 
Kirika just did. &quot;What do you want..?&quot;

&quot;I just want to return this cat to you.&quot; Chloe whispered softly. She 
looked at Kirika as she talked.

The Japanese girl replied nothing. Kirika was once again attached to the 
cat. She brought the cat in and put it beside the pool table. The cat 
seemed to be in deep sleep, because it was snoring instead of made a 
cat-like sound.

Kirika turned her back, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ve got to make some more tea..?&quot; She 
looked at Mireille and smiled.

The blonde sighed in reply. &quot;Yeah..&quot; She lowered her gun unwillingly, 
and walked to the table to drink her tea.

Chloe, who was obviously happy to be invited, gladly step into the 
apartment. Not too long after that, the tea was ready. Now there were 
three cups of tea on the table. The truth was, Mireille felt 
uncomfortable drinking tea with Chloe. She didn&#39;t like the purple haired 
girl too much, after all. Tough the reason for it was not clear for 
herself.

&quot;What were you doing back then?&quot; Mireille asked sharply, while Chloe 
sipped her tea.

The short haired girl stopped sipping her tea, &quot;None of your business.&quot;

Silence. No one said a word. Chloe didn&#39;t answer the question, and in 
return Mireille secretly glared to Chloe. They kept their position, 
and..

&quot;Thanks for delivering the cat.&quot; Kirika broke the silence.

Chloe smiled to Kirika. The brunette replied her smile slightly. 
Mireille did nothing but watch. She didn&#39;t know why, but the purple hair 
kid appearance had bothering her since her arrival. The blonde could no 
longer hold on to keep quiet.

&quot;Was it really you who killed most of the man at that time..?&quot; she asked 
straight forwardly. It is possible that they are Soldats, tough Chloe 
killed them would be a question.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Chloe answered.

&quot;Who were they..? Weren&#39;t they your ally?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

So they weren&#39;t Soldats, eh..?

&quot;...&quot; Kirika stared silently at the two friends of her with no emotion 
at all. Then she sipped her tea.

&quot;Did you injure a woman..?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Please answer my question.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Chloe didn&#39;t say a word. Neither did Mireille.

Minutes had passed by, but neither of the two spoken up. Mireille stared 
at Chloe, while the purple haired kid obviously ignored it. Rather, she 
sipped her tea at ease.

Kirika whispered softly, &quot;I don&#39;t think Chloe did that.&quot; The brunette 
looked at Mireille.

Mireille was kind of shocked to suddenly hear that, &quot;Hmm? You think so?&quot;

Chloe smiled softly to Kirika, but said no words at all.

The blonde sipped her tea and said, &quot;So.. If that person wasn&#39;t Chloe, 
it wouldn&#39;t be our business to know who injured..&quot;

&quot;I have a favor to ask.&quot; suddenly Chloe spoke up.

&quot;A favor..?&quot; Kirika whispered quietly.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;How could you think that I will listen and help you..? Plus, you have 
become somewhat rude to me.&quot; Mireille snapped.

&quot;Maybe you won&#39;t listen, but Kirika will, right..?&quot; Chloe smiled sweetly 
at Kirika.

This weirdo brat..! Mireille was irritated, but tried her best to ignore 
it.

&quot;What is it..?&quot; Kirika asked.

Chloe placed her cup on the table. &quot;Please let me kill the woman which 
was resting in your bed.&quot; Her tone was undoubtedly dead serious.

Mireille eyes grew wider as she heard Chloe&#39;s sentence. But Kirika as 
usual showed no particular change of facial expression.

&quot;So.. it was really YOU who injured Dr. Naomi..?!&quot; shouted Mireille.

&quot;You know her..?&quot; Chloe said in a shocked tone.

&quot;She was a vet.&quot; Kirika said shortly.

&quot;What is your relation to her..?&quot; Chloe completely ignored Mireille, and 
faced Kirika.

&quot;We once visited her to let her examine an animal.&quot; The brunette said.

Mireille looked at Chloe. &quot;Listen. It grows my suspicion to you. You 
said you didn&#39;t injure Dr. Naomi, but you wanna kill her..?!&quot; The blonde 
fully hold herself to not shouting.

&quot;Why do you need &quot;our&quot; permission..?&quot; asked Kirika.

Suddenly, Chloe became silent, and her face was somehow looked worried.

Mireille, who was confused by Chloe&#39;s strange attitude, decided to speak 
up. &quot;Why do you want to kill her..?&quot;

Kirika seemed that she wanted to know too, because she stared at Chloe, 
as if waiting an answer.

Chloe seemed hesitated to answer. She closed her lips, until she heard 
Kirika whispered her name, &quot;Chloe?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s words seemed to wake the purple haired girl up.

Chloe said with a serious tone, &quot;I won&#39;t kill her if both of you do not 
wish me do it.&quot; A second after she added, &quot;It is due to the fact that 
you already know her, which make it inappropriate to kill her now.&quot;

Mireille caught the meaning of Chloe&#39;s words. It meant that she already 
knew that both Mireille and Kirika wouldn&#39;t easily let Chloe kill Dr. 
Naomi. The vet had become their friends, somehow.

&quot;But, I still wonder why did you want to kill her?&quot; Mireille asked, 
still suspicious.

Chloe didn&#39;t say anything for a while. She looked like she was thinking 
for the best word to answer. She looked at Mireille. &quot;It wasn&#39;t me who 
suppose to kill her. Rather, it&#39;s you.&quot;

Chloe hadn&#39;t stopped looking at Mireille. She was staring at the blonde 
for a long time, before once again continue her gaze at Kirika. The 
Japanese girl said nothing and remained expressionless. Mireille didn&#39;t 
understand what was it that Chloe trying to say.

She was trying to avoid Chloe&#39;s gaze back then, because the blonde felt 
uncomfortable about it.

As she was about to asked some more question, Chloe said, &quot;It&#39;s about 
time. I&#39;ll take my leave.&quot;

Chloe looked at Kirika and said, &quot;Please be careful.&quot;

Without saying goodbye to either Mireille or Kirika, the purple-haired 
girl disappeared. The blonde was left to become even more perplexed.</pre>
