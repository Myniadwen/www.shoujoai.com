Sinners, Act II


Kirika heard a pain-filled yelp a split second after the latest bang of 
Mireille&#39;s gun, and next the telltale brusque scuff of rubber shoe soles 
on concrete followed by a low grunt and a dull thud, signalling to the 
astute girl that one of the men belonging to the group who had attacked 
her and her partner had been shot and subsequently stumbled out into the 
open. With this advantageous opportunity presenting itself, Kirika&#39;s 
heightened reflexes that had been rigorously honed to absolute 
perfection over the years instantly took effect, causing her body to 
respond without thought. She bounded nimbly out from behind the 
protection of the pillar she was using as cover, bringing her Beretta to 
bear on the gangster sitting on the floor a short distance away from 
her, for all intents and purposes an easy target.

An easy target... no... not to Kirika. A living being had never been an 
easy target for her, not ever since she had awakened that fateful day 
with no recollection of her life before that moment, her memories 
totally erased except for one, significant word. And after returning 
from the Manor, after learning of the existence of her other self, even 
less so. Indeed, she had hoped to escape from taking another life ever 
again... but it was a na&iuml;ve hope. There was no escape. Her time was up, 
now. It was kill or be killed, do or die; there were no more reprieves, 
no chance to sidestep what the girl was now beginning to realise was 
inevitable. No. She still had her will; she still had a choice. The 
darkness did not rule her, not yet.

Kirika suddenly froze, her muscles locking, petrifying her in a ready 
stance with her pistol raised in both hands, the vulnerable man seated 
on the floor securely in its sights. The view of the Metro station 
blurred and then melted away from the darkhaired girl&#39;s vision, and all 
sounds faded to barely audible muffles, her mind focusing 
elsewhere--inwards, where a more important battle than the one against 
the group of men was being waged.

It was her choice to make--her *own* choice. If Kirika killed now, there 
would be no turning back. She would do it again and again as it became 
easier and easier, a never-ending spiral into sin. A descent further and 
further into darkness, ultimately ending with the darkness itself, in 
its pure, undiluted form.

But she *could* resist. She didn&#39;t have to become a murderer again. She 
still had her own will. Nothing and no one controlled her. Kirika was 
free; her life was her own to live. Soldats, Altena--she was not their 
puppet, not any more. She didn&#39;t have to take the third--and 
significant--step towards the darkness, and towards her other, 
malevolent self that it harboured in its bleak shadows. Right now, at 
this very moment, she could stop the journey. All she had to do was try.

&quot;KIRIKA!&quot;

The desperate shout of a female voice Kirika knew even better than her 
own wrenched her mind violently back to reality, easily demolishing the 
dampening barrier the girl had placed around it and her senses. Her head 
snapped to the source of the yell at the same time her brown eyes 
reregistered her surroundings in their depths, and was met by the sight 
of a breathless Mireille&#39;s unnerved face, the blonde&#39;s own normally icy 
blue eyes imploring. Mireille&#39;s posture was also taut and she looked 
primed, coiled to spring. But her partner&#39;s edgy stance was not what 
drew Kirika&#39;s attention. Her face. It was the woman&#39;s face she focused 
on. Mireille&#39;s left cheek had three roughly straight lines scrawled 
across it. Three *red* lines.

As Kirika watched, a trickle of blood seeped out of the lower of the 
scars, the drip sketching a ruby trail down Mireille&#39;s cheek before 
pausing at the bottom of her chin for an instant. It then dropped slowly 
towards the floor, as though the air it fell through was made of gooey 
syrup. Blood. Mireille was bleeding. She had been hurt. Kirika&#39;s partner 
had been hurt because Kirika herself had failed to support her. Kirika&#39;s 
hesitation had resulted in Mireille being hurt. The woman Kirika loved 
had been hurt because of her!

Something crumbled inside of Kirika, something important, but the 
awareness that something had was vague to her, merely a distant rumble 
in the far reaches of her mind, if it could even be called that. It was 
eclipsed by another sensation, a heavy, leaden lurch of something 
thrusting forwards to fill a sudden gap inside her with sluggish yet 
resolute force, like crude oil jetting out of an unobstructed pipe into 
clear water. The lunging sensation gripped Kirika&#39;s static body, and for 
an instant the farthest outskirts of her vision seemed to pulse a 
soulless black.

The droplet of Mireille&#39;s blood hit the floor, its landing punctuated by 
the crack of a 9mm calibre bullet discharging from the firing chamber of 
a Beretta M1934 Commercial echoing around the station. The slug tore 
mercilessly into the right eye of the confidently smirking man sitting 
on the floor, tossing his head back. The revolver he was pointing at 
Kirika went off as his body jerked with the impact of the bullet 
brutally invading his skull, his finger squeezing the trigger 
mechanically. But his aim was ruined with the jolt, and the .38 round 
whizzed harmlessly by the stationary girl&#39;s head, sending several of her 
dark locks flapping with its passing before it slammed into the wall 
behind her. Kirika didn&#39;t flinch even a millimetre.

The stricken man toppled sideways, his smug smile frozen permanently on 
his features and one eye gone, now just a flood of burgundy fluid 
remaining that dribbled out of the empty socket and down his face in a 
thick rivulet as he collapsed.

The other man armed with a twelve-gauge pump action shotgun swung his 
weapon in Kirika&#39;s direction at his companion&#39;s unexpected demise, but 
the assassin was already moving, rushing straight at him at a breakneck 
velocity, almost already upon him in the heartbeat between her gunshot 
and his turn.

The gangster&#39;s face displayed his panic and his actions manifested it as 
he fired a shell recklessly at Kirika, but all the spray of buckshot hit 
was the section of floor a couple of metres behind where she had once 
been, the agile girl having bounded diagonally into the air to her 
right, where a support column stood, to evade the blast. Kirika 
automatically bent her knees as her feet touched the pillar, appearing 
to suspend in the air for a fraction of a second, attached to the 
column, and then propelled herself off it in an anti-clockwise spin, 
lashing out with her right leg at her opponent&#39;s weapon. Her foot struck 
the barrel of the hoodlum&#39;s shotgun, knocking it forcefully aside with 
the power of her short leap behind her kick, effectively rendering it 
useless against her and leaving the man exposed for further attack.

Kirika crouched as she hit the floor and went with the momentum of her 
initial spin, whirling around one hundred and eighty degrees before 
rising to her full height at the climax of her twirl, jabbing viciously 
upwards with her left elbow into her taller foe&#39;s throat, crushing his 
larynx as if it were a cardboard tube. The man let out the gurgle of 
someone slowly beginning to suffocate and then dropped to his knees. His 
shotgun fell to the floor with a clatter, forgotten as all his attention 
was dedicated towards trying to breathe, his hands clutching futility at 
his closed-off throat.

Kirika&#39;s eyes flicked to the left and her head turned slightly in the 
same direction as if to look over her shoulder, where she knew her third 
adversary dwelled with his back to a pillar a few feet to the left of 
the one her first enemy had used as shelter. But at this angle it 
provided him with no protection. Her acute hearing picked up the sharp 
inhalation of someone preparing to shoot a firearm, and she 
instinctively rolled behind the choking man kneeling before her just as 
his comrade started wildly releasing blazing hot lead her way, appearing 
devoted to expending all of his valuable ammunition in a solitary 
assault.

The final two of the twelve undisciplined shots that didn&#39;t end up 
hitting the walls or ceiling drove an equal number of bullets deep into 
the torso of the kneeling gangster Kirika was employing as a human 
shield, sparing him from a lengthy and agonising end at the hands of 
asphyxiation. He keeled over face first, revealing behind him--to the 
horror of his companion--a stooped Kirika with her pistol wielded 
steadily in one hand and its barrel pointing straight at him, her 
expression detached--emotionless.

A single 9mm round took the shocked hoodlum in the left side of his 
upper chest, throwing him back against the column he had once been using 
as cover. &quot;Holy...&quot; he whispered in a croak before he slid down the 
pillar to land in a limp heap on the floor, the light in his eyes 
vanishing and his grip on his empty handgun slackening.

The tinkle of an ejected bullet casing dwindled in the background. 
Kirika blinked, and then suddenly it was over. It had been only a matter 
of seconds, but now three people were lying unmoving on the floor. Dead. 
Slain by her hands. Three lives snuffed out effortlessly as if they were 
nothing. And it had come so naturally to her. Killing always had, 
however. But it was different this time. Kirika had had no control over 
her actions; she had simply... acted. One second she had been looking at 
Mireille, and the next three people were dead. Her darkness... Kirika 
had touched it... she had *seized* it. And she had not recoiled at the 
foul contact.

It was quiet in the station, not even a whisper to be heard. The death 
cries of the condemned had ceased, the roar of the instrument of their 
ruin hushed. And their murderer silent--as always--and as she had been 
throughout their execution. It was a quiet in stark contrast to the 
cacophony that had filled the station&#39;s walls only a handful of seconds 
before. Seconds. Mere seconds and suddenly Kirika&#39;s conceptions about 
herself and her life had been brushed away as if the daydreams of a 
child. But they had been childish conceptions, in retrospect.

Kirika stood up slowly, her gun smoking and her head bowed, making an 
effort to keep her gaze fixed to the floor where the evidence of her 
sins did not pollute her vision... and remind her of her weakness. So 
much for free will. So much for choice. Her resistance had lasted barely 
all of two seconds before folding. A puppet with its strings cut was 
evidently still a puppet.

Kirika&#39;s eyes moved lethargically to the weapon in her hand. It felt hot 
from its use, and light, comfortable to handle. Like it was an extension 
of herself. Part of her. Maybe it was. Maybe it always had been. Weapons 
were the tools of an assassin&#39;s trade. And Kirika was an assassin. An 
efficient killer. It was what she was trained to do. What she was born 
to do. No escape. No peace. It was who she was. She was a sinner.

Kirika felt something that had been progressively withering for a long 
while inside of her go into its death throes with the harsh 
realisation.... Hope. Hope for a normal life, hope for freedom from her 
past. There was no hope for people such as her. Her hands were black 
with sins, corrupted. It was all they knew.

Mireille stepped cautiously out from behind the support column she had 
been utilising as cover in the corner of Kirika&#39;s eyesight. The woman&#39;s 
mouth hung slightly open as she surveyed the bloodshed her partner had 
wrought, her countenance crossed somewhere amid great relief, mild 
bewilderment and... pleasant satisfaction. She stopped a couple of 
metres from Kirika and looked around the area for a few more seconds, 
seeming at a loss for what to say.

Finally, Mireille&#39;s gaze rested on Kirika, her eyes scanning over the 
girl&#39;s slim body circumspectly but thoroughly, obviously searching for 
any injuries. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked with an oddly cheery tone and 
a smile, if a minutely shaky one, on her features. &quot;You had me worried 
for a minute.&quot;

Kirika simply nodded and mumbled wordlessly in the affirmative. She knew 
Mireille was referring to physical wounds. After all, they were the ones 
that really mattered. An assassin&#39;s body was her most essential aspect. 
Nothing else was relevant. Kirika was certain Mireille was genuinely 
concerned about her, but she was unsure about the motivation behind her 
concern. Was it out of affection for the girl she cared about; the girl 
she loved? Or was it purely out of &#39;professional&#39; interest, to her 
partner in murder, merely a fellow assassin? At one time, Kirika would 
have been absolutely positive that it was the former, but lately... 
lately....

Kirika&#39;s head abruptly turned to Mireille as she suddenly remembered 
that the woman had been hurt earlier, the depths of her soft brown gaze 
anxious as all other thoughts bar her love&#39;s condition were purged from 
her mind. &quot;Are *you* okay?&quot; she inquired quickly, examining Mireille&#39;s 
left, bloodied, cheek with a meticulous eye.

Mireille&#39;s smile widened a bit and she reached up to touch her scarred 
cheek gingerly with her fingertips. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said gently, 
dispelling Kirika&#39;s unease about her welfare a little, &quot;I know it 
probably looks bad, but they&#39;re only scratches.&quot; The blonde then sighed 
tiredly, her smile becoming wry. &quot;The smallest wounds always tend to 
bleed the most.&quot;

Mireille&#39;s pretty smile then disappeared completely from her face, her 
expression turning serious. &quot;There&#39;s still one more,&quot; she said gravely. 
&quot;In the car, upstairs. He could be lying in wait for us; stay alert.&quot;

Kirika nodded. Back to business. No peace.

She followed after Mireille as the blonde quietly walked past the three 
corpses and up the stairs of the Metro station&#39;s entry passageway, her 
Walther P99 held with its barrel aiming skywards in her hands, ready to 
serve its function to kill at a split second&#39;s notice. Kirika&#39;s own gun 
remained by her side, dangling loosely in her right hand while she kept 
her eyes focused straight ahead until she started climbing the stairs, 
not wanting to see her handiwork, the testament of her true existence; 
her purpose in this world.

Mireille paused at the bullet hole ridden corner they had taken shelter 
behind near the start of the shootout, peeking around it to check for 
any sign of danger. After a moment, she carried on her advance up 
towards street-level, skirting nonchalantly past the body of the man she 
had vanquished with ease slumped on the next set of steps, and dodging 
the wide section of staircase that was tarnished with puddles and 
streaks of red. Kirika traced her footsteps exactly.

Mireille swiftly inspected her flanks and rear as the street came into 
view, prudently ensuring that no one was waiting in ambush for her and 
Kirika. Deeming that there was no adversaries set to waylay them ahead, 
the blonde proceeded to stealthily traverse the last few steps of the 
staircase, walking onto the darkened pavement by the street, Kirika 
joining her an instant later.

Kirika observed that the fifth and final gangster who had apparently 
remained behind in the car he and his friends had shown up in was 
sitting askew in the front passenger seat, his legs hanging outside of 
the vehicle, and was clutching his right upper arm where he appeared to 
have been shot, if the large scarlet blot discolouring the sleeve of his 
jacket was any indication. Mireille must have managed to wound him 
during her flight into the underground Metro station.

Upon spotting Kirika and Mireille&#39;s emergence from the station&#39;s 
brightly lit street entrance, the man&#39;s eyes widened and, letting go of 
his injured arm, made to reach across his body for something inside the 
car--most likely a weapon.

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Mireille called out in a no-nonsense voice, bringing up her gun 
sharply as she did so for added incentive while striding forwards, 
Kirika indolently bringing up the rear.

The goon wisely complied, slowly drawing his hand back and raising it in 
the air in a gesture of surrender. Kirika was glad. It meant there was 
little chance she would be forced to kill him... for the moment, at any 
rate. Although, Mireille would probably beat her to it if the situation 
turned violent. That would be a better outcome. Murder... the woman 
didn&#39;t seem to have the same problem with it as Kirika did. Certainly, 
she seemed at home with it. Kirika wished she could have the same 
aloofness. In the past, she had felt nothing when she took a life, and 
indeed, she still felt virtually nothing. But later she had discovered 
it was that very fact that caused her sorrow. And that still hadn&#39;t 
changed, either. Ending a life was wrong. It was a sin.

A small, marginally muted part of the Kirika wondered then if Mireille&#39;s 
blas&eacute; attitude towards murder was truly a quality to be admired. 
Nevertheless, she didn&#39;t judge her partner as a bad person because it. 
It was somehow okay when it came to Mireille. It was a facet that made 
the woman who she was, after all. The woman Kirika loved.

Of course, Mireille didn&#39;t have another persona lurking inside of her to 
consider. A personal darkness that thrived on violence; on slaughter. 
Kirika wondered how long it would be until the darkness succeeded in 
consuming her, now. Clearly her supposed strong, resolute willpower was 
merely a self-deluding illusion. If she couldn&#39;t even restrain herself 
from snuffing out three lives, what hope did she have at holding sway 
over the darkness? And with her evident willingness to kill, that 
darkness would now move to infect her heart and soul with its poison 
even more aggressively than ever before.

Mireille positioned herself a few steps in front of the yielded hoodlum, 
aiming her Walther unwaveringly at his head. Kirika stood behind her and 
just off to the right, giving herself a good view of the man and his 
other arm; the wounded one. It was still resting by his side and even 
though he had taken a bullet there, he could yet use it to secretly 
retrieve a weapon that would consequently be utilised against Mireille. 
And Kirika *had* to support Mireille. Her partner had already been 
injured once tonight because of her negligence. She wouldn&#39;t permit it 
to happen again. There was a tickling in the far recesses of Kirika&#39;s 
mind at her stanch promise, a whisper of something... a faint memory 
perhaps. But the girl ignored it. Now was not the time for reminiscence. 
The present was dismal enough as it was.

&quot;Talk,&quot; Mireille demanded coldly, her blue eyes narrowing to menacing 
slits. &quot;Whom do you work for? How did you find us?&quot;

The gangster looked up defiantly at the blonde, but under her unshakable 
gaze he then flinched and bowed his head submissively. Kirika noticed 
his eyes shift discreetly to the subway entrance, however, as if seeking 
help from his absent friends. Little did he know they couldn&#39;t even help 
themselves, now. Nor would they ever have a chance to again.

&quot;Your associates aren&#39;t coming,&quot; Mireille said pitilessly, evidently 
also catching his straying eyes. She visibly tightened her grip on her 
pistol. &quot;I won&#39;t ask a second time,&quot; she then warned.

The gangster raised his head to look at his interrogator again and then 
swallowed hard, sweat beading on his brow. For a moment Kirika believed 
he would not answer her partner&#39;s questions despite the woman&#39;s sincere 
threat, but then after a number of tense seconds, and in a somewhat 
gruff and resentful voice, he spoke.

&quot;Millet--I work for Millet,&quot; the man at last confessed grudgingly. &quot;He 
runs out of Pigalle. Owns most of it, too. Not the classy joints, 
though; the sleazy ones.&quot;

&quot;Go on,&quot; Mireille prompted, motioning with her gun a tad.

The wounded goon eyed the Walther P99 warily for a second, followed by 
the imposing woman who brandished it, and then after apparently weighing 
his chances of survival if he opted to be difficult, sensibly concluded 
that a lack of compliance would prove fatal. He continued. &quot;Two guys 
wandered into the club he uses as his base the other day--Slick Chicks. 
Nice place, you&#39;d probably get a job there fine,&quot; he said, his last 
comment uttered with a degree of contempt as he glowered at Mireille. 
This seemed to antagonise Kirika&#39;s counterpart for some reason, her 
trigger finger twitching pointedly. The man swallowed apprehensively 
once again and quickly went on. &quot;They were Asian guys, one really up 
himself, the bastard.&quot; He spat out the final word, the memory of the 
visitor obviously leaving an objectionable aftertaste with him--Kirika 
could relate to that particular feeling. &quot;They wanted two women 
whacked--&quot; His eyes darted between Mireille and Kirika meaningfully, 
&quot;--you two. Paid us a whole bundle as well.&quot; The goon looked back at the 
Metro entrance where his friends still had not come out, sneering. &quot;Now 
I know why.&quot;

Kirika frowned a little. That wasn&#39;t good news. If Ryosuke and 
Vincent--the clear clients of Millet and his gang--were hiring others to 
try and assassinate her and Mireille, it would mean they would be thrown 
into more confrontations. And more lives would be lost in the process.

Mireille&#39;s frowned too--albeit much deeper than Kirika--no doubt reading 
more or less the same implications behind their captive&#39;s words. 
Although the darkhaired girl didn&#39;t think the amount of people they 
would be forced to kill as a result of the false Noir&#39;s actions even 
registered in her mind. Or at least, not in the same way it did in 
Kirika&#39;s.

&quot;And how did you find us?&quot; Mireille further grilled the man.

&quot;We have people who find other people,&quot; the hoodlum said simply. But his 
lips then curled up into a wan and slightly tremulous smile. &quot;I really 
thought Rousseau and his pals would fall short on this one, though,&quot; he 
revealed. &quot;The details on you two were so scarce a lot of the guys 
thought it was hopeless. Strange....&quot; The goon&#39;s brow creased in mild 
perplexity and his eyes took on a somewhat faraway look. But they soon 
refocused on his subjugator and the deadly weapon she held in his face, 
the here and now apparently more crucial than the past to him. &quot;But I 
guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised why there was so little information about 
you, now.&quot; He shook his head in bafflement mixed with some amazement, 
gaping at the pistol in Kirika&#39;s small hand. &quot;Who *are* you people?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not important,&quot; Mireille said levelly. &quot;Not to you.&quot; She took a 
step back from the wounded man. &quot;Stand up and walk towards the Metro,&quot; 
she then ordered, gesturing with her Walther for him to rise, flicking 
it upwards a couple of times.

The gangster did as he was told, albeit very cautiously and quite 
bitterly, getting to his feet and then walking to the Metro station&#39;s 
entryway with a hand pressed once again to his gunshot wound, Mireille 
marshalling him onwards with her gun at his back. Kirika chose to remain 
where she was--she knew why her partner was taking him there. And she 
didn&#39;t think she could stomach any more death tonight.

The goon looked over his shoulder nervously once he reached the top of 
the flight of stairs leading down to the first landing on the 
passageway, no doubt seeing the gruesome carcass of one of his gunned 
down companions, but Mireille motioned for him to keep going, her face 
as frosty as winter&#39;s heart. The blonde assassin stayed at street-level 
as he trudged deeper into the station&#39;s entrance, and soon he 
disappeared from Kirika&#39;s sight. The girl looked away, then, focusing 
her gaze on the pavement in front of her pink shoe clad feet.

A lone gunshot suddenly rang out in the night, spelling the end for the 
informative gangster, his body joining the others of his gang in their 
subway station tomb. Kirika lifted her head and glimpsed Mireille 
holstering her Walther under her coat with a weary sigh. The woman then 
turned around and strolled calmly back to Kirika.

&quot;We should go. It&#39;s late, but regardless we&#39;ve lingered too long. 
Someone&#39;s bound to have heard at least one of the shots,&quot; she said 
sternly. Mireille then smiled quite brightly, as if moments before she 
hadn&#39;t just coldly executed a man without a second thought. &quot;Besides, 
I&#39;m probably a mess,&quot; she added in a much more light-hearted tone, 
touching her injured cheek delicately with one hand. &quot;I want to return 
home and wash up.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika responded dourly, her eyes drawn to Mireille&#39;s smile. It 
was resplendent on the blonde&#39;s beautiful visage--her smiles typically 
were when directed at Kirika--but on this occasion to the girl&#39;s eyes 
there was something different. If she concentrated and looked lower, 
beneath its stunning veneer, the smile appeared to lack warmth. It was 
instead... beguiling... even a little sinister. And made all the more by 
the blood smudged over the left side of Mireille&#39;s face. It was a smile 
that a lion gave to another of its kind who was affiliated with the same 
ferocious pride. It was one of camaraderie, one of shared calling, one 
offered after successfully devouring prey. To Kirika it contained no 
fondness save that a lion held for its hunting partner. It was not a 
smile that possessed the qualities of love.

The unseen wound in Kirika&#39;s chest flared up once again, radiating a 
deep-seeded pain beyond measure. She should have seen it sooner. It was 
okay, though. She was not truly the same as Mireille, after all. She was 
by far deeper in sin than the blonde was; Mireille was an angel compared 
to her, one of the celestial beings the girl had read existed up above 
in a place called Heaven. Moreover, if Mireille was an angel, then 
Kirika was the opposite--a demon from down below in the dark domain of 
Hell. And how could an angel love a demon? It was impossible. No, a 
sinner of Kirika&#39;s like was not deserving of love... not even from a 
&#39;fellow&#39; lion.

Mireille leaned forwards and examined the trio of scars marring her 
cheek in the mirror belonging to the medicine cabinet affixed above the 
bathroom sink in the apartment. She turned her head further to the 
right, providing a better angle to scrutinise the scratches, and then 
fingered them tentatively, debating whether or not it would be 
worthwhile to dress them to promote quicker healing. Deciding that to 
apply a bandaid or three to her face would be blatantly obvious and 
definitely attract people&#39;s unwanted looks, the blonde emitted a 
displeased breath of air and picked up a tube of antiseptic cream, 
settling on simply treating the cuts and forgoing covering them. She 
squirted out a dollop of the ointment onto her fingertips and started 
rubbing it softly into her lesions, the cool, soothing mixture gently 
relieving the stinging sensation emanating from them.

After she had scrubbed away the build-up of dried blood smeared around 
the wounds and over her cheek, what remained hadn&#39;t looked too bad. The 
flying pellets that had brushed across Mireille&#39;s face courtesy of a 
lucky ricochet had scored only shallow grazes, merely minor tissue 
lacerations that she was confident would heal fast--the Corsican 
assassin had enough experience with all sorts of injuries to know. In 
the meantime, the cuts were nothing a little well-placed makeup wouldn&#39;t 
conceal. It wasn&#39;t the first time her features had been blemished due to 
the frequent rigors of her vocation. Indeed, the practice of hiding cuts 
and bruises with the aid of carefully selected cosmetics was a talent 
Mireille could label as having mastered. Still, she... *disliked* when 
she suffered an injury on the job, and especially if that injury was 
localised to her face. Being hurt was always a risk in Mireille&#39;s line 
of work, along with the possibility of permanent scarring on her person 
as a result of those hurts, and both were some things she endeavoured to 
avoid. Having to spend time recovering from a serious wound was 
irritating to say the least, and even the most trivial of injuries could 
pose a nuisance to a professional assassin. Visible scratches and 
contusions unconsciously drew people&#39;s eyes, and attention was something 
a contract killer did *not* like when on an assignment. And of course, 
there was also the pain factor to be considered. Mireille had 
unfortunately gotten intimate with lead and many other excruciating 
things several times during her life as an assassin, and it was not the 
most... pleasant... of experiences.

As Mireille massaged the last vestiges of the cream into her scars, 
deliberately taking longer than necessary, her eyes slowly drifted away 
from their reflection in the mirror and to the open bathroom doorway, 
where a clear line of sight into the bedroom was offered to her. And 
also a clear line of sight to Kirika.

Since returning home to the apartment, Kirika had simply stood there in 
the bedroom, looking forlorn with her head lowered while she gazed with 
distant and downcast eyes at the rug arranged on the floor; eyes that 
Mireille was certain did not even register its pattern. She had cast off 
her parka shortly after entering the room despite the apartment&#39;s 
radiators not having heated its interior to satisfaction yet on this 
cold night, the garment now lying on the couch across from the bed with 
the diminutive girl&#39;s Beretta M1934 resting atop it. Mireille had a good 
idea of what was bothering Kirika--she didn&#39;t have to be her partner to 
know that. The blonde wasn&#39;t blind; she had witnessed the sensitive 
girl&#39;s &#39;episode&#39; in the Metro station during the engagement with 
Millet&#39;s men. And nor was she stupid. The gunfight with the gangsters 
had been the first occasion Kirika had shot anybody since she and 
Mireille had wiped out Altena&#39;s enclave at the Manor. The first occasion 
she had killed. It was only natural that she was suffering from some 
after effects of reacquainting herself with the black path. Kirika was a 
feeling-hearted girl, after all, unlike Mireille. It had to be difficult 
for her to cope with.

However, Kirika would come to terms with it, just like she had prevailed 
over her initial misgivings earlier tonight. Nevertheless, her behaviour 
had concerned Mireille a great deal, enough for the Corsican to consider 
some reckless courses of action... some quite uncharacteristic courses 
of action. But then, for a moment, the woman had thought.... Well, it 
was immaterial, now; there was no need to dwell on past events. Mireille 
and Kirika&#39;s performance tonight had essentially been acceptable, with 
an equally acceptable outcome.

Mireille dabbed her still visibly red and sore cuts one last time with 
her fingertips, and then straightened with a tired sigh. Hopefully, with 
the help of her treatment, by next morning they would show some 
improvement, even if it were just a hint of some.

After sparing a parting look in the mirror to check her scars once 
again, Mireille turned away from the sink and walked to the bathroom 
doorway. She loitered there a little uncertainly as she looked out into 
the bedroom, where Kirika hadn&#39;t budged even an inch from her spot on 
the rug; appearing as miserable as the previous instance she had 
observed her. The Corsican sighed a second time at the disheartening 
sight, but then assumed a pleasant smile on her face, ignoring the 
slight twinge from her left cheek.

&quot;You did very well tonight,&quot; Mireille remarked in a soft and tender 
tone, seeking to lift Kirika&#39;s low spirits with some encouraging words. 
&quot;I was most impressed. You....&quot;

Mireille&#39;s voice trailed off to a whisper as a single tear leaked out of 
Kirika&#39;s left eye and rolled down her face, leaving behind a wet streak 
that glistened in the bedroom&#39;s light.

&quot;Kirika...?&quot; Mireille ventured hesitantly, her smile evaporating as a 
concerned expression took over her countenance.

A second teardrop formed in Kirika&#39;s other eye and trembled there for a 
second, before escaping to follow its predecessor&#39;s course, spilling 
down her cheek and merging with the first hanging below her chin. More 
tears joined them a moment later, the reticent girl&#39;s eyes brimming 
constantly with growing moisture, overflowing, the excess trickling 
paths to the bottom of her jaw where they collected, before dripping 
wetly to the floor. Kirika&#39;s cheeks were soon soaked with tears, but she 
never said a word nor even uttered a sound; she simply stood there and 
wept silently, the depths of her soft brown gaze containing a profound 
sadness, coupled with a strange manner of detachment that seemed to 
amplify it.

Mireille watched from the bathroom doorway, taken aback by her partner&#39;s 
sudden breakdown plus not to mention considerably alarmed... and 
furthermore unsure what exactly to do. Any kind words she offered would 
be hollow; merely sweet nothings, void of any real weight no matter how 
much the woman meant them--she had no idea what had caused Kirika to 
become so distressed, and thus how could she provide compelling 
assurances? But if that were the case, what action was she supposed to 
take to calm her partner? Thinking back, the only other occasion 
Mireille had seen Kirika in such a state was at the colosseum ruins on 
the Manor&#39;s estate after the darkhaired girl had been forced to kill 
Chloe to protect her from the knife-throwing assassin&#39;s jealous rage... 
although this particular time the Corsican&#39;s counterpart appeared even 
more distraught; whatever was upsetting her, it had to be significant. 
But when Kirika had wept then, Mireille, motivated by the desire to 
remind her partner that they had no time for the luxury of grief, and in 
turn prompt her to recover herself and rearm so they could take the 
fight to Altena, had bestowed her with a semblance of a hug, a rather 
discomfited one. It had seemed to placate her partner, however, despite 
its inelegance; perhaps the blonde should make a similar effort now. 
Regardless, Mireille had to do *something*--Kirika was clearly in pain, 
and yet the woman was just standing there looking at her as she quietly 
cried her heart out. Mireille wouldn&#39;t be able stomach watching her 
partner suffering such anguish for much longer. She *had* to act.

Stepping forwards into the bedroom, Mireille hesitantly approached 
Kirika, and, following a moment&#39;s indecision, tentatively placed her 
hands on the girl&#39;s bare shoulders. After receiving no negative 
response--or a positive one, either--from her partner, the blonde took 
another nervous step towards her, and then awkwardly began to gradually 
snake her arms down Kirika&#39;s back, keeping her palms flush with the 
exposed skin offered to her by the girl&#39;s spaghetti top.

&quot;Mireille!&quot; Kirika sobbed in a heartbreaking voice full of emotion, and 
without warning flung herself at Mireille, burrowing her face in the 
furrow of the woman&#39;s neck. She wrapped her thin arms tightly around the 
blonde&#39;s body, pressing her smaller own closely against her taller 
partner&#39;s.

All of Mireille&#39;s muscles stiffened at the unexpected contact, and as 
well in surprise at Kirika&#39;s startling reaction to her rather meagre 
gesture. But as she felt the warmth from the close proximity of trim 
girl&#39;s body permeating her own, she quickly relaxed and resumed her hug, 
her arms sliding down Kirika&#39;s back almost naturally, enfolding her; 
holding her comfortably near. The neck of Mireille&#39;s red top rapidly 
became drenched with her partner&#39;s teardrops, the girl&#39;s weeping seeming 
to escalate instead of lessening with her embrace.

A faint, rueful smile grew on Mireille&#39;s face, her blue eyes turning a 
little misty. She should have hugged Kirika a long time ago. She could 
see that the girl had required one badly. Kirika clung to the Corsican, 
handfuls of her top clenched in her grasp, by all accounts a drowning 
girl clutching desperately to her sole lifeline. And the awful thing was 
Mireille had been aware that this girl had been drowning. Yet she had 
done--no, she had *chosen* to do--absolutely nothing to help her, 
instead citing weak excuses to avoid acting. All this time Kirika had 
been suffering in silence with Mireille callously looking on, not even 
*attempting* to console her. At this moment, the woman felt like the 
lowest form of life in the world. Why had she done that? Why had she 
stood idly by, doing *nothing* to comfort Kirika? Fear that she would do 
something wrong, perhaps? Or was it just plain stubbornness, the blonde 
still rigid in her old ways?

No matter what the reason was, it was unacceptable that she had let it 
drag on for so long. Kirika had needed her, but Mireille had failed her. 
They were not Noir, but they were still a partnership, and one *far* 
beyond mere &#39;business&#39;. How could Mireille have forgotten that? They 
were partners in love--in life. It was the prime reason Kirika had 
returned from the Manor with Mireille to Paris; that the blonde had 
neglected that fact shamed her terribly. Kirika had *needed* Mireille, 
and yet the Corsican had wilfully neglected the girl. She *knew* her 
partner was fragile; for all her strength in combat her psyche possessed 
only a brittle one--Mireille&#39;s consideration was crucial for Kirika&#39;s 
continued wellbeing.

No longer could Mireille afford to dither around and ignore Kirika&#39;s 
needs, or for that matter, how the introverted girl felt about her. She 
had taken her partner&#39;s feelings for granted, simply deriving of them 
without conferring anything in return. But theirs was a partnership that 
was supposed to be of give and take, where the two members supported 
each other in every way. It was time Mireille took responsibility and 
started properly and seriously performing her vital role in Kirika&#39;s 
life... as her lover, not just as her colleague.

&quot;We&#39;re both so clumsy at this, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Mireille whispered softly. It 
was true. While the blame for this mess fell squarely on the blonde&#39;s 
shoulders, Kirika was not without her fault. Her very personality was 
not very conducive to a communicative relationship. But that was no 
excuse; it was something Mireille had been conscious of. *She* had to 
take the first steps to further their relationship; the onus was on her, 
it all rested solely in her hands. If she wanted it to progress, then 
she had to be the bold one--she had always held that assertive position 
over Kirika, after all. Now that dominance had to be used for something 
else far more important than their occupation.

Mireille heard Kirika mumble something into her neck and then squeeze 
her tighter in her arms, apparently agreeing with the woman&#39;s comment. 
She sighed remorsefully. This would be the last time Kirika shed tears 
because of her actions... or lack thereof. Everything would be different 
now. Mireille would make sure of it. She would make sure that nothing 
like this failure would ever happen again. And besides... her heart 
would not allow it.

******

Kirika hugged Mireille tightly, cuddling into her--clinging to her--with 
the desperate need of the damned seeking salvation. She held onto the 
woman as if her life depended on it, but maybe, in a way, it did. The 
dull pain that had plagued her chest with its unbearable, never-ceasing 
ache had departed, replaced by a heady elation that purified the unseen 
wound and sealed it; healed it. And yet her tears wouldn&#39;t stop flowing 
from beneath her closed, wet eyelids, staining Mireille&#39;s clothes. 
Perhaps this was the wound&#39;s way of disinfecting itself. But it didn&#39;t 
matter. None of it mattered. Because she had been wrong about Mireille. 
So wrong.

Mireille loved her. Kirika felt it in the blonde&#39;s embrace, and she felt 
it in her heart as it beat beside her own. Mireille still loved her; she 
had never stopped. Kirika, in her naivety, had just never realised it. 
She should not have doubted the woman&#39;s love, even if she was not 
deserving of it. Mireille really was an angel. Who but an angel could 
love the person who had murdered their family? Who but an angel could 
love the person who had delivered the greatest pain in all their life 
upon them? But Mireille did. She loved Kirika in spite of those ghastly 
truths. So who but an angel could Mireille be?

Kirika was a sinner; she accepted that reality, and had done so ever 
since the events in the cavern below the Manor. She was a sinner who 
would never achieve atonement for any of her crimes. But that was 
perfectly fine. She now remembered her purpose in this world, her *true* 
purpose--one she shouldn&#39;t have forgotten--and the memory of the oath 
she had silently pledged all those years ago when she only a child. 
Kirika *had* made a choice in the Metro station, an unconscious choice, 
but a choice nonetheless... just like the two she had made at the 
Manor--the first at the colosseum, and the second in the cavern below 
the estate. A choice to uphold her vow to look after Mireille, to 
protect her; defend her, to be her strength when she was weak, to 
support her when she could not. And it was a vow Kirika promised she 
would maintain ever more, regardless of what happened in the future. 
That she loved the woman she had sworn to protect was irrelevant, that 
the woman loved her was irrelevant. It was Kirika&#39;s purpose; her reason 
for living when by all rights she should have died with Altena and the 
woman&#39;s shattered ambitions long ago.

Odette Bouquet&#39;s last words had instilled a ray of light--of 
hope--inside Kirika&#39;s young heart that tragic day she carried out her 
first of many atrocious misdeeds, a ray that had once saved both her and 
Mireille&#39;s lives. And now, years later, it still shone brightly inside 
of her, illuminating a new source of light to battle her darkness 
with--Mireille, the late woman&#39;s daughter. Kirika would fight for her. 
And she would not falter. She would hold the darkness at bay for 
Mireille&#39;s sake. The girl&#39;s will *was* strong, stronger than anything 
when bathed in her love&#39;s radiance.

Kirika&#39;s eyes opened a crack, a blurred view of her Beretta lying on top 
of her parka on the couch greeting them. Her gun was an instrument of 
murder, but it had not yet been used to commit any sins. She had killed 
with it, but Kirika now realised those lives she had taken had been 
warranted--she had purely defended the woman she had pledged to look 
after. Mireille had given her that gun--a new one, a *fresh* one. 
Mireille had bestowed upon her a fresh start. Kirika&#39;s slate was not 
washed clean; indeed, it was marked with the blood of countless, but 
from here on out, the &#39;sins&#39; she performed would be as a direct 
consequence of honouring her vow. Maybe they would still be sins in the 
eyes of God, but if that were the case, then Kirika would welcome them; 
she would accept them wholeheartedly.

&lt;Embrace it....&gt;

Yes, she would embrace being a sinner if that was the price of upholding 
her promise to Mireille&#39;s mother. She would soil her soul in the muck of 
darkness if that were what it took. But she would not succumb to it. Not 
with the light of Kirika&#39;s redeeming angel favouring the girl with her 
precious warmth, her potent illumination. No darkness could stand 
against its intensity.

Kirika smiled softly, a great burden fading from her shoulders. She was 
not deserving of Mireille&#39;s--of an angel&#39;s--affection... but she now 
knew that sometimes even a demon could be loved. Or maybe, Kirika 
considered, it was only an angel who could ever truly find it in their 
heart to love a demon.

To be continued....


Author&#39;s ramblings:

So ends the short foray into an angsty Mireille/Kirika relationship... 
for now, anyway. I couldn&#39;t have them at odds with each other for too 
long; this is not a &#39;get together&#39; fic, it&#39;s a &#39;we already know we love 
each other so let&#39;s have mushy romantic scenes while the mean author 
throws obstacles at us and makes us shoot things&#39; fic. ^_^ Besides, I 
don&#39;t want to repeat the themes of the series. And I also needed to give 
their relationship a kick in the right direction, and a reason for 
Kirika to becoming willing to kill again. ^_~

I debated whether Kirika would be aware of the existence of angels and 
demons and all that (when writing for her I have to make sure to curb my 
analogies and metaphors somewhat), but I figured in her time recovering 
from her gunshot wound she would have taken the time to read a little 
(like reading Mireille&#39;s magazines) and picked up some common knowledge 
(not too much though... it&#39;s more fun that way ^_^).

From now on, expect some nice Kirika and Mireille romantic stuff (and 
action. You have to have action) while the angst goes on the back burner 
for a bit. Of course, you know it will rear its angsty head again in the 
future at some point. ^_^</pre>
