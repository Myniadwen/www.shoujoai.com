<h1>The True Noir</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/monikku.html">Monikku</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: This is a short short fic. Mireille&#39;s thoughts as she 
watched Kirika and Cloe truly fight together for the first time in Taiwan 
(Heartless Assassin episode).

Ah, the title of this fic is really generic. Sorry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Back to back, you and Cloe fought with ease. It was awe-inspiring. 
Gracefully moving together insync. Such beauty, untethered, formless as 
water; pouring in streams, dripping like tears, thrashing as harsh waves... 
then still and placid.

Back to back, the same way you and I slept.

A sharp pain in my heart, as though I felt our thread of fate snap. I 
thought I had lost you in that moment. Just as liquid as you two fighting 
together, you began to seep through my fingers.

I had never felt more obsolete.

You simply didn&#39;t need me.

Who are you Yuumura Kirika? Any semblance I had of you washed away. Were you 
fighting to save me? As you walked up those steps, I thought you had gone 
mad. Was I worth that much to you? Would you be able to take them all? I 
would not have had the skill, but you are nothing like me, are you? You are 
a perfect assassin.

You and Cloe were... perfect.

The True Noir.
