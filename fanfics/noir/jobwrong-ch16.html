<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Kirika&#39;s eyes opened wide in shock, before closing slowly in pleasure. 
Mireille&#39;s warm lips were pressed against her own, drawing out her 
ardour. Their bodies were still intertwined, with Mireille crushing her 
own against cold metal as she pressed her lips furiously against 
Kirika&#39;s.

Kirika&#39;s mind was numb, unwilling to focus on anything but Mireille&#39;s 
intoxicating touch, even as she knew there was something they had to do.

She tried to push Mireille away, fighting the reluctance she felt. Any 
fighting died immediately as Mireille&#39;s tongue swept into her mouth, 
exploring her, ravishing her. Her limbs refused to work as her mind 
focused on that single warm muscle.

When she broke away Kirika was breathing heavily, gasping after breath 
as she tried to gain control of her body again. It was shivering 
heavily, was it fear? Defenitely not, it was pure lust.

&quot;Mireille... why are you doing this?&quot; She managed to gasp out, turning 
her head as Mireille made to kiss her, so Mireille&#39;s lips met her cheek. 
Unperturbed the Blonde kissed her way up to Kirika&#39;s ear, where her 
teeth played with her ear lobe. Making Kirika shiver in shock and 
pleasure.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter Kirika?&quot; Warm breath whispered into her ear, &quot;I know 
you want this as much as I do...&quot; The tongue dipped into her ear, 
momentarily breaking any coherent chain of thought at the incredible 
feelings sweeping through her.

&quot;But you... didn&#39;t...&quot; She whispered back, remembering Mireille&#39;s 
insistence to take it slowly. Hands roaming down her sides was making 
her speaking difficult.

&quot;Well now I do. I know you want it too, ever since that night in 
Paris...&quot; Hands were on her behind, holding her tightly to Mireille&#39;s 
warmth, crushing their bodies as close as skin would allow.

&quot;What do you mean...?&quot; Kirika asked, succumbing to the urges she felt as 
she lightly kissed Mireille&#39;s collarbone.

&quot;That job, when you fell in the Merophoxyll...&quot; There was that name 
again, the thing which Edwin had just poisoned Mireille with. But Kirika 
still didn&#39;t know what it did. As if she cared right now.

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Kirika replied noncommittally too engrossed in Mireille&#39;s 
sleek neck as she kissed her way up it.

&quot;It made you lust after me... I&#39;m so glad...&quot;

Kirika stopped.

&quot;It what?&quot; She asked suddenly, her eyes boring into Mireille&#39;s blue 
ones, glazed with lust as they were. It just couldn&#39;t be...

&quot;Forget what it did...&quot; Mireille whispered back to her, leaning down and 
kissing Kirika&#39;s neck. Kirika&#39;s eyes were wide.

Mireille full of lust, a drug which made her lust after Mireille. 
Merophoxyll... It all clicked in, the reason for Mireille&#39;s lust. It 
wasn&#39;t her own, but was drug induced, by that red gas.

Was Kirika&#39;s own the same? She knew that it was. That she had been 
hunting Mireille as much as Kirika felt hunted now. Like prey.

Knowing that Mireille did not want her, but only that the drug was in 
control made her feel like the lowest scum. To take advantage of 
Mireille&#39;s current affliction as she had been doing would make her as 
bad as the ones who had made the drug...

Edwin!

&quot;Mireille stop this now! We have to kill Edwin!&quot; Mireille&#39;s hands didn&#39;t 
stop roaming.

&quot;Why would I want to stop? When I have you so close?&quot; Kirika&#39;s breathing 
hitched as she felt the lust rise in her again. Furiously she beat it 
down.

&quot;No, Mireille, I won&#39;t let you do this, and you&#39;re not so heartless as 
to take it!&quot; The words were not her own. They were the words spoken to 
her by Mireille when Kirika had been molesting her on the aeroplane. 
Kirika felt the anger she knew Mireille must have been feeling for her. 
How stupid she had been... How selfish...

&quot;Make me an offer...&quot; Mireille replied blithely, repeating Kirika&#39;s own 
words to that statement. Kirika felt guilty for lying.

&quot;Help me kill Edwin. When we get back to Paris I&#39;ll sleep with you.&quot; 
Mireille moved back, a smile gracing those perfect lips.

&quot;Alright then, where is he?&quot; Kirika forced herself to walk away from 
Mireille&#39;s encircling arms, now that she could identify her own lust as 
a separate part of herself, the drug. She realised how powerful it was, 
clouding her senses, fogging her mind.

But the hate she felt for herself, that was more than enough to 
overpower it.

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Kirika motioned, heading towards the door at the end of the 
corridor, her Beretta M1934 held ready in one hand. Something told her 
Edwin would be an easy man to finish.

The door opened easily, and a typical control room greeted her, 
computers and screens adorning the walls, as well as chairs and some 
cupboards. Edwin was nowhere to be seen.

But sight wasn&#39;t Kirika&#39;s only tool. A faint rattling and a smell of 
sweat and fear drew her to a steel cupboard, which she easily opened to 
find the man shivering like a wreck inside. He had no weapon.

&quot;Please don&#39;t kill me!&quot; He whined. His voice cracked with fear of death. 
Even drugged, Mireille knew what to do.

&quot;I won&#39;t if you answer our questions. Who ordered this, it&#39;s obvious you 
would not attack us on your own.&quot; Instead of being relieved the man 
seemed to become even more frightened, sweating even more. The scent was 
assaulting Kirika&#39;s nostrils.

&quot;I can&#39;t! He&#39;ll kill me!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m much closer than he is.&quot; Mireille replied threateningly, but 
surprisingly the man just shook his head.

&quot;He&#39;s everywhere, he can do anything, he&#39;s the master of our lives. I.. 
can&#39;t... you can kill me, but he can erase me!&quot; Kirika felt confusion 
through her guilt, both sensations eating away at her. Who was this he? 
Edwin was sounding like some religious fanatic, afraid of the 
retribution of some god.

Mireille lifted her Walther, pointing it at Edwin&#39;s head with obvious 
intent to decorate the walls. The man shook violently.

&quot;He&#39;s the author! The author, the writer of our destinies! But that&#39;s 
all I know! You said you wouldn&#39;t kill me!&quot; Mireille nodded, her gun 
going back to it&#39;s holster.

&quot;I did.. Kirika?&quot;

Her Beretta spoke, smashing him back against the wall as he slumped down 
into death. Kirika felt no sadness, no pity. He deserved death!

&quot;Now that&#39;s done..&quot; Mireille whispered to her playfully, Kirika span to 
confront her immediately.

&quot;No! In France I promised!&quot; She felt flustered and angry, how could 
Mireille take killing someone so blithely? They had just killed someone, 
this was hardly a romantic place anymore!

&quot;Is that what we came for?&quot; Mireille asked, pointing to some injection 
guns on a metal table. Kirika studied them and found that they were 
labelled as cures for Merophoxyll. Sadly she picked one up, feeling it&#39;s 
weight in her hands.

Sighing she shot it into her arm, wincing at the noxious feeling. 
Placing it back down she picked up another.

&quot;Mireille? Kiss me.&quot; The blonde&#39;s ears seemed to perk up as she walked 
forwards quickly and swooped down, capturing Kirika&#39;s lips in a deep 
kiss. Kirika savoured the sweet taste of her, knowing that this would be 
the last time they ever kissed. When this was over, things would go back 
to how they had always been, with neither of them wanting this...

Sadly, it being the hardest thing she had ever done, Kirika shot the 
serum into Mireille&#39;s arm, making the woman jerk back in pain. Kirika 
didn&#39;t let her escape, as she kissed her deeper. After another few 
seconds the pain must have subsided for Mireille remained in her arms, 
kissing her.

Regretfully Kirika moved back. It might take a day for the antidote to 
kick in, but she knew that Mireille would never forgive her for this...

&quot;Come on Mireille. Let&#39;s go home. To Paris...&quot;
