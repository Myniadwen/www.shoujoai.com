<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 9 of 17)</h1>

<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>	Sorry if this chapter sounds unlikely, I am English, but I assume 
that SOMEWHERE in New York there would be an Opera house. Plus I&#39;ve 
never been to an Opera, so I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s there and what&#39;s 
not. But this is MY opera house, so there!

The Phantom of the Opera. (OH MY GOD! A CHAPTER TITLE!!!!)


	&quot;But Mireille where are we going?&quot; Kirika whined for what must 
have been the tenth time. The both of them were currently walking 
briskly down the streets of new York, Mireille dressed in a pretty red 
dress with a long skirt. Her hair was loose, trailing down her back and 
over her bare shoulders. 

	Kirika too was dressed in a nice way, though it had been Mireille 
to choose the clothes, if she hadn&#39;t then Kirika would have gone in her 
work clothes along with those damned pink shoes. The young Asian was 
wearing dark blue denim jeans and a frilly white dress shirt, she also 
had a dark blue jacket which she simply hung over one shoulder, too warm 
to wear. Over all the effect was that she looked rather masculine, but 
in a striking way.

	Kirika, normally so taciturn was embarrassed about the shirt, 
complaining that it felt silly and looked ridiculous. Mireille had 
silenced her complaints almost immediately by telling her she looked 
pretty in it. At which point the girl had stopped complaining 
completely.

	&quot;Just out.&quot; Mireille replied, enjoying leading the girl on.

	&quot;But where? Come on tell meeeee.&quot; Mireille let out a light laugh 
as Kirika dragged out the vowel, her face begging for an answer.

	&quot;Alright, alright. We&#39;re going to a small opera house to watch an 
opera. We have our own booth there.&quot; Kirika smiled in answer and nodded, 
before her expression turned sly.

	&quot;Why Mireille, is this a date?&quot; She asked, her voice low. Mireille 
turned to her, reaching down and cupping the girl&#39;s chin before placing 
her face a hair&#39;s width from Kirika&#39;s, their breath mingling.

	&quot;It could be...&quot; She replied huskily, leaning in as if to kiss 
her, then when their lips were almost touching turning around and 
heading off again. Kirika fell in beside her a moment later, her face 
burning with embarrassment and her eyes not meeting Mireille&#39;s. Mireille 
in turn felt like laughing, for the first time since this whole thing 
had begun, she felt in control. Perhaps pretending to be infatuated with 
Kirika would be easier than she had first expected it to be. 

	Getting into the opera house was a simple affair. She presented 
the tickets she had bought earlier, and went inside. No one even seemed 
to notice that she was with a woman dressed like a man, no stares and no 
huffy comments. For that Mireille was thankful. 

	Their booth was a good one, high up and with a fine view of the 
stage, a large plush couch-like seat, and a small dark wooden table. 
Their was also a cooler bucket with two bottles of fine wine in it.

	Kirika walked in and plopped down into the red couch, her face 
showing that she was impressed with how comfortable it was. Mireille 
smiled to herself before joining her, carefully moving her skirts out of 
the way before sitting next to the girl. There was only one seat.

	Mireille could see this going wrong in so many different ways, the 
alcohol, the shared seat, the closeness to each other, the dimly lit 
opera house..... But the man she had spoken to, their client had been 
right, Mireille had led men on before, in her job it was sometimes 
necessary to make a man trust you enough to move away from his 
bodyguards. She was out of practice, never having needed to use such 
techniques since teaming up with Kirika. But the skills never left you.

	The opera began, it was the phantom of the opera.

	&quot;Wow, this tastes nice.&quot; Kirika whispered from the side of her, 
Mireille turned to look at her. The small girl was sipping red wine from 
a small glass, greatly enjoying it from her expression. 

	&quot;Yes please Kirika, I&#39;d love some, it was so kind of you to 
offer.&quot; Mireille whispered back playfully, making Kirika blush and 
murmur an apology before grabbing the other glass and pouring some wine 
for Mireille. 

	In truth Mireille had never taken Kirika out drinking, the obvious 
reason being that she looked too young for barmen to serve her it. The 
more professional reason being that it would clog her senses. The 
inexperience was shown by the fact that the glass she handed to Mireille 
was full to the brim of the wine. And Kirika was drinking it as one 
might drink water....

	&quot;You should go easy on that. It&#39;s quite strong.&quot; Mireille warned, 
taking a sip and agreeing with her earlier comment. Strong was an 
understatement. 

	The opera went on and on. It wasn&#39;t performed with the same skill 
as it was in France, but it was still quite good. Kirika was leaning 
against her now, seemingly enjoying her presence. Mireille didn&#39;t mind, 
at first she had been rigid and tense, but after a while the warmth 
against her side became more comforting. A silent reminder that someone 
was still there with her. 

	It was getting on towards the end of the opera, where the last 
song was now being sung, Mireille was watching happily, she enjoyed the 
songs sung in this story. 

	&quot;Mireille....&quot; A voice whispered from nearby, Mireille tuned to 
see what her partner wanted. Halfway she was met by Kirika&#39;s lips. Had 
her senses not been dulled by alcohol she might have been able to think, 
but as it was her mind went numb instantly.

	Kirika tasted sweet, although she could taste the alcohol on her 
as they kissed. Her body acting automatically since her mind was still 
frozen, Mireille returned the kiss fiercely, pressing her lips against 
Kirika&#39;s, even as her back arched in pleasure.

	A soft hand was snaking slowly up her leg, under her skirt, 
sending waves of pleasure through Mireille&#39;s body as their kiss 
continued, she felt herself leaning back against the seat as Kirika&#39;s 
mouth moved to her neck, kissing her way down to her bare shoulders. 
Mireille sighed in pleasure.

	Then her brain kicked back in.

	&quot;Kirika no!&quot; She blurted out, bucking her body and dislodging the 
small girl from her quickly. Kirika didn&#39;t resist as Mireille scooted as 
far away from the girl as she could, her breath coming in ragged gasps, 
and her eyes wide.

	&quot;Mireille.....&quot; Kirika whispered, not meeting Mireille&#39;s eyes. 
Mireille calmed herself down, her mind working at a hundred miles per 
hour as she tried to figure out what the hell was going on with herself.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry Kirika, it&#39;s not you.... I&#39;m just not sure if I&#39;m ready 
to....... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She blurted out quickly, not wanting the girl to 
dissolve into tears on her. &quot;I&#39;m just too confused right now.&quot; That was 
defenitely true.

	&quot;It&#39;s alright Mireille. I understand.....&quot; Her expression showed 
that she didn&#39;t, the words just said because they were expected. 
Mireille sighed and leaned forwards, placing a hand on her cheek as she 
lightly kissed the girl. Kirika&#39;s eyes went wide but she made no motion 
to deepen it or do anything else. Mireille broke it and moved back.

	&quot;Just let&#39;s take things slowly.&quot; Kirika nodded quickly, her eyes 
were brighter at Mireille&#39;s words.

	&quot;Okay.&quot; She answered, smiling happily. Mireille&#39;s heart felt like 
it was breaking. 

	She&#39;s so happy that she thinks I love her......when this is all 
over..... will she be heartbroken? Kirika didn&#39;t meet her eyes for the 
ending of the opera, and was the first out the door as everyone moved 
away. Mireille was a few seconds later, her mind still whirring and her 
heart beat still racing.

	I was not turned on by that. I did not enjoy it. I did not kiss 
her because I wanted to....... I am really bad at lying to myself..... 
So she had to pretend she was interested in Kirika? The worst thing was, 
that she thought she might be. She sighed.

	&quot;Somewhere,....... someone is laughing themselves silly at 
this....&quot;


	 That&#39;s it I&#39;m afraid..... not that much humour in this, it wasn&#39;t 
that easy to write. And it isn&#39;t as long as the last chapter was..... 
But I felt I had to update.
	Don&#39;t expect the last chapters, (not that I&#39;m near the end), to be 
overly funny either. In his last review Phil-G hit the nail on the head. 
(Don&#39;t look, it&#39;ll ruin the story).
