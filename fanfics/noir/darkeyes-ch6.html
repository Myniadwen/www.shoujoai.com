<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>A few hours later, the soft chiming of bells rang through the air as 
Mirelle stepped from the small corner store, shifting her bag slightly 
higher on her shoulder. She was alone, although both young women had 
stopped by the apartment right after their meeting with Andre. The 
blonde Corsican had wanted to get started right away; Kirika, on the 
other hand, had begged off to pick up a few more art supplies at one of 
her favorite stores. After assuring her partner she wasn&#39;t going to see 
anyone, the Japanese young woman had happily taken off with her backpack 
full of sketchbooks.

Mirelle herself had made the rounds to a few of their nearby contacts, 
looking for any news about Garrison and his people. None of them had 
heard anything yet, but now that they knew she wanted the information, 
it was likely one or more of them would get back to her in the next few 
days. Once that was done, she&#39;d found herself near a cluster of small 
gift and novelty stores, so the blonde had decided to take a look 
around.

Smiling cheerfully, the Corsican assassin started off toward home, 
swinging her purse a bit as she strode along. Though the stores had been 
small, she loved shopping in general, and she&#39;d come across a few small 
treats and trinkets she happened to like. Again, that small mental voice 
popped up in her head. And of course, you just had to find the perfect 
box of chocolate for Kirika.

Mirelle sighed inwardly, but she couldn&#39;t argue with herself. She had 
spent quite a bit of time in the last store, trying to find some of 
those white chocolate rounds with peanut butter filling Kirika had liked 
before. A small, square box of the candy was currently tucked safely in 
one corner of her purse, gift-wrapped with a pretty little length of red 
ribbon.

She deserves it after last night. Maybe I&#39;ll even get home soon enough 
to cook something good. Maybe ravioli? Though we had pasta last time. 
Chicken and rice?

The blonde Corsican was so wrapped in her thoughts, she almost missed 
the tiny crying noise that squeaked from somewhere nearby. Still, the 
lost little sound prodded in her mind, and she stopped dead in her 
tracks, looking around with a small frown. It sounded almost like a 
baby&#39;s whining &#150; but what would a baby be doing here?

To her right, an alley stretched along the back of two stores, dumpsters 
and small piles of trash lining either side of the grubby brick walls. 
Listening again, Mirelle&#39;s frown deepened. The noise was definitely 
coming from that direction, but now that she was focused on it, the cry 
didn&#39;t seem to be a child at all. A flash of pale, pale gold caught her 
eye, striking and vivid against the dented dark green of the nearest 
dumpster, stalking silently along the garbage-strewn ground. Mirelle 
stole curiously closer, her own boots making hardly any noise against 
the dingy concrete, intent on the movement.

Her eyes widened as the creature finally slipped free of some crumpled 
newspaper and leapt on its target. It was a cat &#150; well, more of a 
kitten, she realized after a moment. It hardly looked old enough to be 
out on its own. Certainly it didn&#39;t seem to be faring too well. Its 
apparently-beige fur was matted and covered in grime, one ear obviously 
torn and infected, its small body nothing more than skin and bones. 
Mirelle watched as the little beast lifted its paws carefully, revealing 
the prize beneath &#150; a beetle of some kind, no more than a quarter-inch 
long, half-squashed already from the minimum weight of its executioner. 
A sharp pang of sympathy touched the blonde. The poor thing was eating 
bugs and garbage? But she could hear the soft whimpering noise clearer 
now, and she could tell the feline wasn&#39;t doing it. If the kitten wasn&#39;t 
making that sound, what was?

While Mirelle looked on, the dirt-covered ball of fuzz bent its head and 
snapped up the partly-crushed beetle. But instead of eating it, the 
small creature turned and raced back around the dumpster, treasure still 
held carefully in its jaws. Entranced, Mirelle found herself stealing 
after it, still quiet as only a trained assassin could be. On the other 
side of the metal container, she found a ragged, torn-apart packing box, 
stained with water, oil and other unmentionables. Turned on its side, 
there seemed to be a little &#39;nest&#39; inside, ratty bits of cloth and 
claw-shredded papers pushed together in mostly-damp clumps.

And tucked in that mess? Mirelle felt her heart turn over. A second 
little kitten huddled weak and miserable in the largest crumpled pile, 
deep black fur just as dirty and trash-covered as its companion&#39;s, body 
even skinnier, if such a thing were possible. It was this tiny creature 
that was making the heartbreaking mewling cry, eyes closed and ears flat 
against its small head. The little beige kitten made a beeline for the 
box, dropping its offering just in front of its fellow sufferer&#39;s mouth 
and nuzzling gently at it. Now Mirelle understood. The first feline had 
been hunting bugs to feed the second.

Protecting her partner.

The thought made her throat strangely tight &#150; she understood that 
driving urge better than anyone. Drawn to the sodden, pathetic little 
creatures, the blonde Corsican stepped forward, a soft intake of breath 
betraying her presence. The reaction from the beige kitten was dramatic. 
Whipping around, it gave a furious yowl, back arched and claws dug in, 
hissing and spitting. It was a display that would actually have been 
frightening if the little thing hadn&#39;t been so torn up. Shocked, she 
realized the pale gold feline had deep, vivid blue eyes &#150; the exact same 
shade as her own. One hand came up gently, comforting. &quot;Shhhhh.&quot; She 
soothed. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;m not here to hurt you, I promise.&quot;

Digging in her bag, Mirelle&#39;s fingers danced over the various packages 
until she found the one she wanted. She wasn&#39;t sure whether or not they 
could eat chicken, but the pre-cooked slices for dinner salads were the 
only meat she had with her. The bag came open with a sharp tug, and the 
blonde gently held out a few pieces in the flat of her palm, crouching 
down to their level. &quot;See? Here&#39;s a snack &#150; I bet it&#39;s better for the 
two of you than a bug.&quot;

With an angry snarl, the beige cat stood its ground, tail whipping back 
and forth. For a moment, Mirelle thought it was growling, too; then, 
with a sharp pang, she realized it was the small creature&#39;s stomach 
rumbling at the smell of food. The young woman rolled her hand to let a 
bit of the chicken fall in front of the little beast. &quot;Okay, you don&#39;t 
have to take it from me. Just eat.&quot;

The first kitten hesitated, ears still twisted back, and Mirelle 
understood. It thought she was trying to distract it with food. Then the 
smaller dark kitten whimpered, and the creature seemed to make up its 
mind. Inching forward, the beige feline snapped the meat up in its jaws, 
dragging its new prize swiftly back to its partner. The little creature 
gulped and practically inhaled the food. Mirelle smiled, dropping 
another piece and watching as the small beast ate that, too. She didn&#39;t 
know what she was going to do with the two of them. They were so beat up 
and hurt . . .

I can&#39;t keep them &#150; it would never work, I told Kirika that before &#150;

Wide eyes like warm amber met hers, a quiet mew sound touched her ears, 
and the rest of her jumbled objections vanished in a rush of awe and 
sweetness. The dark kitten had exactly the same color in its gaze that 
Kirika did. That rusty-red shade, like liquid mahogany, so soft and full 
of hope it tugged at her heart. Mirelle blinked, captivated. It even 
sounded like Kirika&#39;s question noise.

&quot;Mon petite ange.&quot; The whispered words were so soft she didn&#39;t even 
realize she&#39;d said them. Mirelle&#39;s face sharpened with decision, and she 
nodded suddenly, swiftly. To hell with all of it. Her hand moved with 
the assassin&#39;s quickness, scooping up both tiny forms and cuddling them 
close to her chest. The pale gold kitten gave a struggling hiss of fury, 
slashing at her with small claws, but after a moment, the small creature 
calmed, as if it realized she meant them no harm. Standing, she shifted 
the little animals carefully to the inside of her coat. She had to get 
them to a vet, quickly.

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Miss Bouquet?&quot;

Glancing up, Mirelle nodded, fingertips still trailing gently over the 
pale gold head of the larger kitten. She had to be mindful of the poor 
thing&#39;s ear, but it seemed to grudgingly enjoy the petting. The smaller 
dark feline was curled in a ball under her palm, almost asleep, its 
little body rising and falling in soft rhythm. Around them, the scents 
of hospital and animal mixed, seeming to rise from the very walls of the 
examination room, but Mirelle didn&#39;t much care.

&quot;I&#39;m Dr. Lucas.&quot; The vet &#150; a woman that looked to be in her early or mid 
thirties, with soft, reddish brown hair tied back in a bun, pale skin 
and blue-green eyes &#150; smiled cheerfully and moved farther into the room, 
shutting the door with one hand while striding to the examining table. 
Mirelle had spread one of the nearby folded towels onto the steel 
surface so her little charges wouldn&#39;t be cold or uncomfortable, its 
bright colors especially vivid against their grimy mats of fur. Dr. 
Lucas gently lifted the beige kitten first, standing the feline up and 
running both hands over the small body. The little kitten meowed, 
sounding rather annoyed, but it put up with the touching after a gentle 
pet from Mirelle. &quot;So you said you found these two pretty little girls 
out on the street?&quot;

The blonde Corsican nodded again, slightly anxious. After getting out of 
the alley, Mirelle had hailed a cab and headed directly to the pet store 
and vet at one of their favorite boutique malls; she and Kirika had 
stopped there often to look at the pets on offer, and she knew the 
people there were good at their work. The cabbie hadn&#39;t liked the idea 
of animals in his cab, especially unwashed street animals, but double 
the fare with a generous tip had convinced him to make top speed. &quot;They 
had a few little pieces of cooked chicken, but I don&#39;t know when they 
got to eat before that.&quot;

&quot;Well, let&#39;s have a look.&quot; Lucas returned the pale gold kitten and used 
both hands to cradle the smaller feline, gently drawing the little 
creature closer. Her eyes were intent, focused on this examination, 
though the tiny beast didn&#39;t make a single noise of complaint. After a 
few minutes, the vet released the dark-furred kitten and sighed. &quot;Just 
as I thought.&quot; She looked frankly up at Mirelle, voice blunt. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve seen many worse cases. They&#39;re dehydrated, starved, covered 
in dirt and fleas and god knows what. The gold one has a bad infection 
in her ear and nose, and the little one here has what feels like a 
broken ribs. It looks like she might have been hit with a moped or a 
motorcycle.&quot; There was a pause. &quot;I don&#39;t even know if they&#39;ll survive 
the night.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re fighters.&quot; Mirelle replied softly. The little black kitten 
pressed her fuzzy face into the Corsican&#39;s arm, nuzzling, and Mirelle 
smiled softly as the small gold curled up beside her companion with a 
low, growling sort of purr. Side by side, warm and safe and content with 
each other &#150; it seemed almost like an omen. &quot;Whatever they need, they&#39;ll 
get. Money doesn&#39;t matter. I just want them well.&quot;

To her surprise, Dr. Lucas smiled back, eyes knowing. &quot;Somehow I thought 
you&#39;d say that.&quot; She agreed, nodding. Pressing a button on the small 
intercom against the wall, she spoke briskly. &quot;Lisa, please bring in one 
of the little fuzzy beds.&quot;

&quot;Yes m&#39;am.&quot; A female voice answered briefly, and a moment later, the 
door opened once more. This time, it was a young woman of about the 
Corsican&#39;s own age, her long, straight blonde hair tied back in a 
businesslike ponytail and arms full of clipboard and cushion. She was 
rather pretty, with pale skin, delicate features and large, intelligent 
gray eyes. Mirelle was surprised to see those eyes widen just slightly 
after a curious flick in her direction, lips parting in a flare of 
shock, but the expression vanished so quickly the blonde assassin 
thought she might have imagined it. The girl &#150; Lisa &#150; settled a small, 
open-topped bed for cats at one end of the table, its plain blue fabric 
outside a nice contrast to the comfortable-looking sheepskin lining. 
&quot;Should I set up cages?&quot; Again, the eyes moved swiftly from the vet to 
Mirelle and back.

&quot;They should stay together.&quot; The words were out before Mirelle realized 
she was speaking, but Dr. Lucas&#39; smile just widened. &quot;Just one. And make 
sure the IVs and the worm tests are ready for me when I get back there, 
huh? We&#39;ll wash them up and give them some meds for tonight.&quot;

&quot;Names?&quot; Lisa raised an eyebrow, pencil poised and waiting in her left 
hand. Mirelle gently scooped up the fuzzy pair, holding them close for a 
moment and ignoring the rank smell from their fur. The little dark 
kitten meowed softly, licking her hand; the pale gold feline simply kept 
up her purr, tail flicking back and forth. &quot;They &#150; don&#39;t have names 
yet.&quot; She hesitated, thoughtful and slightly embarrassed. Naming the 
kittens was the intelligent thing to do, something she should have done 
earlier. She should have made up names if she needed to. But it just 
didn&#39;t feel right. Naming them wasn&#39;t her privilege. &quot;Kiri &#150; someone 
else is going to name them, when they come home.&quot;

&quot;Your little flatmate.&quot; Dr. Lucas made it a statement, eyes dancing. 
When Mirelle glanced at her, she laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve seen the way she looks 
at the kittens, dear. I&#39;m fairly sure she&#39;ll adore these two.&quot; Turning 
back to her assistant, the vet added cheerfully, &quot;Just put them under 
Bouquet one and two, Lisa, we&#39;ll know what it means.&quot;

The Corsican nodded, lightly setting her little charges in the soft, 
fuzzy warmth of the cat bed. Running her fingers over the small, 
matching heads, she was startled to realize she didn&#39;t want to leave 
them. So tiny and helpless &#150; they seemed to push buttons in her she 
hadn&#39;t known were there. Like Kirika, her mental voice pointed out, 
flashing the image of her partner&#39;s gentle, delicate face. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
back.&quot; She whispered, the soft tone for their ears only. &quot;I promise, 
Blue-Eyes.&quot; The little golden kitten stared back at her, seeming to 
understand, though the other feline whined softly. Mirelle&#39;s lips curved 
up. &quot;You too, Shadow. I&#39;ll come back for you.&quot;

Straightening, she noticed the vet smiling. &quot;Nicknames of Blue-Eyes and 
Shadow.&quot; She dictated to Lisa, who nodded appreciatively. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, 
Miss Bouquet. They&#39;re in very good hands.&quot; Her face was bright. &quot;And if 
you&#39;ll leave your cell phone number, I&#39;ll call that to keep you updated. 
That way it&#39;ll be a surprise, no?&quot;

Slowly, Mirelle smiled too. &quot;That would be wonderful.&quot; She watched as 
Lisa gently stroked the little heads, letting the small creatures sniff 
at her scent before carefully picking up the cat-bed. Both kittens 
evidently approved; the last thing Mirelle saw before the door closed 
was the two of them cuddled around each other, almost asleep. The 
Corsican took an offered pen from Dr. Lucas and scribbled a number in 
the marked box of the intake sheet. It was untraceable, but it would 
route to the cell phone she carried in her pocket, so there wasn&#39;t any 
worry there. &quot;Thank you, Dr. Lucas. I have to run &#150; do I just pay at the 
front desk?&quot;

&quot;Not a problem.&quot; The vet smiled. &quot;And that&#39;s just fine. We&#39;ll be here 
when you get back.&quot;

Mirelle nodded. A few minutes later, she had paid for a week&#39;s stay for 
the two little kittens and was heading out the door. Home was only a few 
blocks away &#150; she&#39;d probably still get home before Kirika. The familiar 
vibrating jingle of her cell came faintly to her ears, and she frowned 
slightly, reaching for the palm-sized piece and glancing at the front 
screen. Speak of the dark angel. Flicking it open, she held the blue 
phone to her ear.

&quot;Kirika, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile:

Backpack swinging absently from her shoulder, Kirika pushed open the 
door to one of her favorite art stores, smiling slightly as she breathed 
in the scent of open paint and fresh pencil shavings. It wasn&#39;t a large 
shop &#150; on the whole, it carried mostly basic supplies &#150; but it was a 
great place to get the type of charcoal and pastels she liked to use. 
Mirelle had said she was checking with a few of their contacts. Warm 
softness flickered in her rust-red eyes. Kirika knew if her partner 
found a new boutique that caught her eye, the blonde Corsican could be 
gone for hours. If she hurried, Kirika should have time to get home and 
color a few of her &#39;special&#39; sketches. There was one in particular she 
wanted to work on &#150;

Heading directly for the crayon aisle, she stepped around a large stand 
of postcard-sized prints and stopped dead, eyes widening. A familiar 
figure stood casually in front of the pastel section, two different blue 
crayons held up in his hand as he compared their shades. Kirika was 
stunned. Alexander! What&#39;s he doing here? Common sense intruded a moment 
later. It&#39;s a public shop, and it has decent supplies. Any artist in the 
area would stop in if they needed something. I&#39;ve probably seen him in 
here before, but I wasn&#39;t paying attention.

Still, she&#39;d made a promise to Mirelle that she wouldn&#39;t spend time with 
him, and she meant to honor her word. Stepping silently backwards, the 
Japanese young woman shifted her pack higher and turned again. She&#39;d go 
get the things she wanted at one of the other shops a few blocks over, 
and Alex would never have to know she was here.

At just that moment, Alexander lifted his head and spotted her. His own 
eyes widened, and a large grin split his face. &quot;Kirika!&quot; Setting down 
his supplies, he trotted over, laughing. &quot;You&#39;re here &#150; so how was last 
night? Was your friend surprised?&quot;

Damn. The rare curse flicked through Kirika&#39;s mind for a split-second, 
although she couldn&#39;t help but smile at his cheerful attitude. &quot;Yes. 
Thank you again for the ride.&quot;

&quot;No problem &#150; it was my fault anyway.&quot; He grinned, motioning toward her 
bag. &quot;You here for something in particular?&quot;

&quot;Oh &#150; no. Just some looking.&quot; The lie came easily to the young woman&#39;s 
lips, face calm and voice just a tad cooler than usual. If he was busy 
here, she could probably make a quick exit. That was graceful, wasn&#39;t 
it?

Unfortunately, she had no such luck. &quot;Great! You can come tell me all 
about it.&quot; With happy abandon, Alex tugged lightly at her arm. &quot;There&#39;s 
a cute little fountain square over at the end of the block. The benches 
are great for people-watching.&quot;

Mirelle would have made a no-doubt funny remark about how 
&quot;people-watching&quot; seemed to be an unhealthy habit of his. Of course, 
Mirelle wouldn&#39;t have gotten caught in something like this in the first 
place. This was not quite going the way she&#39;d hoped. But it was nice to 
see him again &#150; and it wasn&#39;t entirely her fault. She had to talk with 
him now, didn&#39;t she? She couldn&#39;t risk blowing her cover by just 
suddenly brushing him off. Besides, this would be the best way to let 
him down gently.

That decided, she followed her &#39;friend&#39; back down the sidewalk, where a 
park-like square in the center of the block had been set up as some kind 
of urban park. A large rectangular fountain sat in the center, cement 
fish spouting water upward into the cool evening air, while around it, 
green-painted wooden benches and carefully trimmed foliage were laid out 
for passerby to stop and take a few minutes. Alexander flopped onto the 
nearest bench, his lanky frame sprawling along one side as he grinned up 
at her. His voice was almost infectiously cheerful. &quot;So how did it go? I 
bet the food was spectacular.&quot;

Kirika nodded with just a trace of her usual shyness, settling herself 
on the other end. Her backpack thudded softly on the wood between them, 
a subtle enforcer of personal space. &quot;The veal turned out just right. 
And you were right about the vanilla ice cream with the Dutch apple 
pie.&quot;

&quot;It was always Lisa&#39;s favorite combination.&quot; Obviously pleased that he&#39;d 
helped, Alex leaned back and folded his hands behind his head, raising 
an eyebrow. His eyes shone with happily wicked humor. &quot;So what did she 
bring you?&quot;

What did he mean, saying it like that? Kirika blinked, a strange ripple 
of unease starting in the pit of her stomach. Still, she answered 
honestly. &quot;A suncatcher, a plush toy and a novel.&quot; She paused. &quot;Oh, and 
a small pillow.&quot;

Now it was Alexander&#39;s turn to blink. He stared at her a few seconds, 
obviously confused, then burst into outright laughter. &quot;Kirika, you&#39;re 
so innocent.&quot; He kept chuckling, shaking his head. &quot;I should know better 
than to tease you.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s eyes widened, stunned. Innocent? Alex thought she was innocent? 
She&#39;d been called quite a few things in her short life, but &#39;innocent&#39; 
had never been high on the list. Actually, she wasn&#39;t even sure it was 
on the list before today. &quot;What?&quot;

Her friend smiled and reached across the backpack to pat her hand, still 
snickering quietly under his breath. &quot;I was &#150; making a rather lewd 
joke.&quot; He paused in concern, eyebrows drawing slightly together as he 
looked at her with a question on his face. &quot;She does know that you like 
her, doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

If Kirika had been stunned before, she was absolutely shocked now. Lips 
parted slightly, the Japanese young woman gaped, staring at Alex and 
trying to ignore the way her pulse had picked up. &quot;Alex.&quot; Her voice was 
a mix of exasperation and an odd note of strain. &quot;I can&#39;t like Mirelle.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Alexander frowned slightly, puzzled.

&quot;Because &#150; &quot; Kirika&#39;s brain stalled, reaching desperately for the first 
excuse that came to mind. &quot;She&#39;s a girl.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; Alex&#39;s tone clearly said he wasn&#39;t buying it. &quot;So you&#39;re a girl, 
and she&#39;s a girl. Who cares? It happens.&quot; He shrugged, fixing her with 
an intent look. &quot;Come on, anybody that listens to you talk about her 
would know you care about her. After the whole dinner thing, and the 
apartment &#150; well, I just thought you were both close.&quot;

&quot;We are close.&quot; Her reaction was instinctive and defensive, though she 
couldn&#39;t stop the sudden feeling of tightness in her throat. Or the 
flash of anxiety that raced in her veins. Of course they were close. 
Mirelle was her partner, the only family she had, the only person who 
had ever cared for her as something more than a weapon. &quot;Just not that 
way.&quot;

Alexander&#39;s eyes were shrewd, cunning, though his smile was kind enough 
to take the sting out of his words. &quot;Oh really.&quot; Reaching for her 
backpack, he unzipped it and flicked through the sketchbooks, pulling 
out one with a familiar, lead-smudged cover. Kirika&#39;s heart stopped. &quot;I 
saw this yesterday.&quot; He said quietly, setting the spiral-bound pad 
ever-so-gently on his knees. &quot;They&#39;re all very pretty &#150; you really do 
her justice.&quot;

Kirika wasn&#39;t sure whether to thank him or snatch her precious 
sketchbook back and run. Her hands were shaking now, a fine, frightened 
trembling. Wherever he was going with this, she really didn&#39;t think she 
wanted to know. Gently, Alex squeezed her arm. &quot;You&#39;re not just close, 
Kirika.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in love with her, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

It was like Kirika had been struck with a bolt of lightning. For a 
moment, she couldn&#39;t breathe. Love. The fluttering in her stomach, the 
aching in her muscles, the tightness in her chest and the dizzying rush 
that captured her mind . . . it all fit. That was the word that she had 
tried so hard to find when she wrote her letter to Mirelle. Love was the 
single word that perfectly captured her feelings for the golden-hued, 
sapphire-eyed Corsican. Four simple letters . . . and the one word that 
could never, ever work between them. Her mind spun, a chaotic storm of 
fragmented thoughts and raw, jagged emotion. She didn&#39;t want to believe 
it. &quot;No.&quot;

Alexander watched her and nodded slowly, face filled with understanding 
and an odd sort of pity. &quot;So she doesn&#39;t know.&quot; His voice was quiet, 
soft. &quot;I wondered.&quot;

Kirika shook her head slowly, almost unnoticeably, hair swinging 
slightly from side to side. The way Alex said it, there was almost no 
way to deny the horrible rightness of his words. But if he was right, 
then &#150; all these feelings did have a name. She didn&#39;t just care about 
Mirelle. She was in love with Mirelle. Had been in love with Mirelle for 
a long time. It was a revelation that sent her reeling and left a black 
hole in her chest where her heart should be. &quot;She &#150; she doesn&#39;t know.&quot; 
She whispered miserably. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Alex demanded. He sounded almost belligerent, outraged for 
her. &quot;You&#39;re sweet, you&#39;re smart and cute, and you obviously love her. 
Oh, God, she&#39;s not one of those cold people that doesn&#39;t like anyone, is 
she?&quot;

When Kirika just blinked at him, rather hollowly, the young man sighed 
and explained. &quot;My brother had a girlfriend like that once. She was 
scary as hell. Gorgeous, just like your Mirelle &#150; knew how to dress, how 
to act, how to wrap everyone around her little finger. But it was all on 
the outside. Inside, she was scary. Hardly ever really smiled, cold as 
ice, didn&#39;t seem to care about anybody or anything. Everyone besides her 
was expendable, you know? The kind of person that could kill somebody 
and not blink.&quot;

Well, that last bit was certainly true. Mirelle had killed (and could, 
and would, continue to kill) without any remorse, regret or pity. And 
she did know how to dress well, how to act in society. Manipulating 
people, well, she had Kirika herself, didn&#39;t she? And she&#39;d had Andre 
and Paula and the rest of her contacts for years, before they had ever 
been together. But Kirika knew there was more to the blonde Corsican. 
Intelligence, skill, warmth and care &#150; she had seen all those in her 
partner over the year they&#39;d been together, and especially since they&#39;d 
returned from the Manor. And she knew there could be more. She&#39;d seen 
that flash of heat in those sapphire eyes today, she was sure of it.

Opening her mouth to answer, Kirika never got the chance. A shadow 
flicked swiftly across the pavement on one side, the sound of a footfall 
mingling with a peripheral awareness that set her internal alarms to 
screaming. Leg muscles, tensed, coiled, and she sprang forward, rolling 
free of the bench. Her attacker&#39;s thick, suit-clad arm fairly whistled 
past the space where her neck had been, curling around empty air 
instead. In one swift movement, lean fingers had closed on a large hunk 
of broken brick from the ground and flung it with deadly accuracy. The 
missile flew directly on target, slamming into the man&#39;s forehead with a 
distinct thunk. He toppled over, slumping across the wooden back of her 
former seat, as Kirika finished her move and came up on her feet again.

There were at least eight more of them fanning out in a crude 
semi-circle now, dressed in dark blue suits and button-down white 
shirts, each with the unmistakable bulges of weapons in their 
waistbands. Strong and powerfully built, they looked like someone&#39;s 
hired muscle. All around, the street had mysteriously emptied out, small 
park deserted in the gathering dusk, the air close and ominously 
charged. Questions flicked rapid-fire through Kirika&#39;s mind as the young 
woman shifted to a fighting stance. This was obviously an ambush &#150; who 
had planned it? Apparent she had been compromised somehow &#150; or did 
someone just suspect she knew something, and was taking care of it? Was 
this connected to Garrison, and Andre&#39;s warning earlier?

Not that any of it made a difference, as the man nearest her gave a 
lunge and trained instinct took over. Ducking around his beefy fist, she 
slammed the heel of her palm upward against his nose. The sound of it 
spearing up into his brain made a sickening crunch, but Kirika was 
already past him, unholstering the Beretta from the small of her back 
and firing one shot, then a second before the rest of the goons could 
even react. A fourth thug, slightly more intelligent than the rest, 
whipped a heavy foot at her midsection before jabbing in some kind of 
combination move. Kirika vaulted backwards, landing briefly on one hand, 
back arched as she aimed and took out his knee upside-down. He collapsed 
to the pavement howling with agony, and the partner that had been beside 
him leapt for her. Swaying smoothly to the side, Kirika&#39;s own hand shot 
out, pulling her attacker&#39;s arm and using his own momentum to send him 
stumbling. A sharp twist of his head as he passed, and his body tumbled 
to the ground.

Firing a last shot to silence the knee-capped goon, Kirika paused, 
vaguely surprised for a heartbeat as there was no new assault. She was 
sure she&#39;d counted nine attackers, including the first fool she&#39;d taken 
out. With six of them dead, that would mean three were left &#150;

Then a familiar hand closed around her wrist, and she whirled to find 
herself face to face with Alexander.

&quot;Kirika.&quot; The young man released her as soon as she turned, holding his 
free hand up to stall the attack he seemed sure was coming. He didn&#39;t 
seem frightened or shocked by the gun in her hand, or her apparent 
prowess at taking out the thugs lying dead at her feet. Instead, the 
eyes that met hers were calm, competent and sharp, without a trace of 
pity or hesitation. &quot;Kirika, we have to move. They didn&#39;t get you, did 
they?&quot;

Too surprised with his lack of reaction to answer right away, Kirika 
blinked once as Alex snapped up her special sketchbook, tucking it 
swiftly back into her backpack and tossing the bundle in her direction. 
She caught it, stowing her weapon away automatically before hefting the 
pack over her shoulder, eyes flicking to the bodies that lay scattered 
around them. A quick tally showed there were ten thugs; if she had only 
killed six, that left four of the deaths unaccounted for. Alexander 
grabbed his jacket, then hopped easily over the bench and took her 
wrist, pulling her away without stopping to look back. The two of them 
hurried down the street together, almost flying, steps nearly silent.

About ten minutes later, both skidded to a stop at the loading docks 
behind another set of boutiques. Alex leaned against the smooth brick 
wall, hands on knees and hair falling in his eyes as he 
not-quite-panted. &quot;Damn.&quot; He muttered. Brushing the thick dark bangs 
from his forehead, he looked up at her in awe. &quot;Kirika, that was 
incredible. You were amazing.&quot;

He wasn&#39;t frightened? Kirika didn&#39;t know quite what to do. He&#39;d seen her 
kill &#150; by unwritten assassin law, she should have put a bullet in his 
brain before ever leaving the scene. But the image of those muscled 
bodies intruded, and once again the count didn&#39;t add up. Mahogany eyes 
met his, distant but intense. &quot;You killed those four men.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Missed the one you kneecapped.&quot; Alexander agreed with a shrug, 
obviously not broken up about the circumstances. His gaze was frank, 
interested and rather impressed, voice still slightly breathless. &quot;You &#150; 
You&#39;re Soldats, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Kirika gaped, stunned. She couldn&#39;t seem to do anything other than 
stare. The inane thought that Mirelle would certainly kill her crossed 
her mind. She wanted to interrupt, to protest or deny it, but there were 
so many things humming through her brain she could hardly manage more 
than a single breathy word. &quot;You?&quot;

Alex nodded, going on with an explanation as though it was the most 
natural thing in the world. &quot;Family is &#150; mostly Dad and my Uncles on 
both sides. I&#39;m just a messenger boy.&quot; His grin was rueful, and a bit 
embarrassed. &quot;I thought you were, you know &#150; your shots were beautiful, 
no wasted motions or wild rounds. They didn&#39;t even get a finger on you.&quot;

He &#150; he doesn&#39;t recognize me? He doesn&#39;t know who I am? Kirika&#39;s 
thoughts raced. It seemed absolutely stupid that anyone connected with 
Soldats wouldn&#39;t recognize one of the two Noir. And yet &#150; what was it 
Altena had said, back at the Manor? &quot;Those that attacked you knew 
nothing, because the trials had to be true life-or-death struggles.&quot; If 
his family isn&#39;t highly connected, part of the High Council, he might 
not ever have even heard of Noir. Her heart leapt. If he thought she was 
just another member of Soldats &#150; slowly, she nodded, just once.

&quot;Ha, I was right!&quot; Alexander&#39;s face lit with slow glee. Lounging back 
against the wall, he folded his arms, almost laughing. &quot;Well, that 
explains part of the problem with your friend Mirelle. She&#39;s your 
partner, isn&#39;t she? With work, I mean.&quot;

Kirika nodded again, still not quite able to speak. This was &#150; like 
talking to Mirelle after a hit. They had finished the job, and now they 
could go back to their conversation and their everyday lives. Alex shook 
his head, rolling his eyes with an almost exasperated sigh. &quot;Ouch. 
That&#39;s gotta complicate things a little.&quot; He flashed a toothy smirk. 
&quot;Though if she&#39;s as athletic as you are, that might open up a few 
interesting possibilities.&quot;

Now that she understood the foolish joke, Kirika found herself blushing, 
cheeks flaming a dark pink. Alexander laughed, patting her shoulder. 
&quot;Sorry, Kirika, I couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; He grinned a bit sheepishly. &quot;I 
think it&#39;s a stupid guy thing. But seriously, I do get it. Figuring out 
a relationship like that has to be really tough.&quot;

Kirika tilted her head, watching him, still not entirely sure this whole 
thing was actually happening. &quot;I wonder who they were after.&quot; Her voice 
was soft. Alex sighed at the change of subject and looked thoughtful, 
running his fingers through his hair. &quot;Not sure.&quot; He commented after a 
minute. &quot;Don&#39;t think the family&#39;s made any ripples recently &#150; Uncle 
Jean-Luke is into a bit of smuggling, but it&#39;s just small stuff. We&#39;re 
not high enough up to be much more than foot-soldiers most of the time. 
Did you guys do something big recently?&quot;

&quot;Uh-uh.&quot; Kirika shook her head. A voice that sounded suspiciously like 
Mirelle&#39;s intruded in her head. Does he really expect an honest answer 
to that question? The glance she flicked at his face suggested that he 
actually might. Then again, she couldn&#39;t think of any lie she&#39;d actually 
told him since they&#39;d met &#150; with the exception of the whole &quot;just 
looking&quot; thing earlier. And it was a valid question. Alexander shrugged, 
snickering. &quot;Don&#39;t suppose it matters. Whoever they were, they won&#39;t be 
coming back in a hurry.&quot;

She couldn&#39;t help a small laugh of her own. &quot;Probably not.&quot;

With a cheerful grin, Alex leaned his head back to look at the sky, eyes 
narrowing slightly as he took in the dark wash of blue-black across 
horizon. &quot;Wow, it&#39;s later than I thought. Mother&#39;s going to have kittens 
if I don&#39;t head home.&quot; His eyes danced wryly. &quot;Besides, you&#39;ll have to 
call Mirelle, and I reeeeeeally doubt she&#39;ll want to have me anywhere 
around.&quot;

Kirika ducked her head, almost embarrassed. Shifting her bag where it 
dug into her shoulder, she eyed her friend from beneath a heavy fringe 
of bangs. &quot;Probably not. It&#39;s not safe.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a smart woman.&quot; Alexander touched her shoulder gently until she 
met his gaze. &quot;And if she&#39;s anything like you, she&#39;s probably very 
protective of the things she cares about.&quot; Ignoring Kirika&#39;s flush, he 
shrugged into his jacket. &quot;Be careful, Kirika. See you later.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye, Alex.&quot; She watched his lean frame as he trotted casually to 
the end of the buildings and vanished around the corner. Letting him go 
went against the basic rules of her trade, her very life &#150; and yet, she 
couldn&#39;t find it in her heart to even reach for her weapon. Sighing, she 
turned in the opposite direction, heading for the nearest side street 
with his comment about Mirelle still ringing in her ears. One hand dug 
into the pocket of her jacket and tugged out her cell phone, flipping it 
on and punching a familiar set of numbers as she walked. This wasn&#39;t 
going to go over well. &quot;Mirelle?&quot;

&quot;I need you to pick me up . . . &quot;

Yeah, if anyone thinks this will be a happy phone call, raise your hand.
