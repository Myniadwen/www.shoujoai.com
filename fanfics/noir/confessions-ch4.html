<a href="../noir/confessions-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Mireille stood on a cliff overlooking the Manor. A high-ranking Soldat 
named Remy Breffort had come to her a few days ago to invite her into 
the fold. He explained Noir and the trials and then told her she was 
aslo a candidate. Then Breffort told her that since Kirika and Chloe 
have made it to the Manor and interfering in matters there was taboo, 
that they needed Mireille to kill either Kirika or Chloe and take her 
place, to foil Altena.

However, that wasn&#39;t the real reason she was here. She missed Kirika. It 
wasn&#39;t that she couldn&#39;t live without her; in fact, she went right back 
to her old routine. But she was just going through the motions, her mind 
always on Kirika, asking herself why she pushed her away. And what did 
she mean by &#39;before I do somethng I regret&#39;. She had already known the 
answer; she just refused to accept it. Mireille had already cared too 
much for Kirika and couldn&#39;t kill her. She knew her walls were breaking 
down, that she was losing control of her feelings. Kirika&#39;s admission 
had forced her to see that. And so she pushed Kirika away.

But no more. She was going to get Kirika back, even if she was doing 
exactly what the Soldats wanted. She&#39;d deal with them later.

She got back into her Jeep and drove to the Manor.

********************

Kirika and Chloe were about to start the purification ritual, one of the 
last rituals before they would become Noir. They had already stripped 
and were bathing at opposite ends of the spring, with their backs to 
each other.

Chloe tentatively glanced at Kirika. It surprised her how close they&#39;d 
gotten in only a few days. Maybe Kirika remembered their time together, 
before she woke up in Japan? Whatever it was, she was glad it happened 
and that the accursed blonde hadn&#39;t shown up. She looked at Kirika again 
and made her way to the other side of the spring.

Kirika turned around and before she knew what was happening, Chloe 
kissed her. On the mouth. Using her tongue. On an impulse, Kirika 
deepened the kiss. She couldn&#39;t remember when she&#39;d started loving her. 
She was sure they&#39;d been close before; maybe those feelings were coming 
back to her. She turned them around, pushed Chloe to the edge of the 
pool and started exploring her body.

*******************

Sometime later, Mireille showed up at the ruins. She could&#39;ve sworn she 
saw two people, in the nude, doing something in the grass. She tiptoed 
closer, making sure not to alert them. Her eyes widened as she saw 
Kirika and Chloe making love in the grass, by the pool.
