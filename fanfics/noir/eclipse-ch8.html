<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>I take another sip of tea; my voice is almost gone, and I&#39;m exhausted.

&quot;So the only names we have are Lambert, and a dog named Scruffy.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; I remember how the dog had seemed so happy to see me, and 
wondered if that had been staged as well. They had been very clever with 
their plan.

&quot;And at no point did they mention myself or Soldats.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Noir?&quot; he asks, pen poised in air.

&quot;Not once.&quot; I shake my head. It does seem odd, I thought this happened 
because of our being Noir. For some reason, a chill runs over my body 
and I shiver.

&quot;Your name or Mireille&#39;s then?&quot; he tilts his head, looking at me. I 
suddenly remember what Lambert said when they had come into the 
apartment.

&quot;Mireille...&quot;

&quot;They said my name?&quot; she asks, raising her brow.

&quot;Not your name. They called you... the Corsican heiress.&quot; I falter as I 
see her eyes widen. &quot;They wondered...why you live like this.&quot;

Mireille drops my hand. &quot;Is that so.&quot; She says quietly, standing up. She 
goes over to the dresser and picks up the little white baby seal, 
turning it over in her hands.

&quot;And then she told Mireille on the phone that-&quot;

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille&#39;s hands freeze and she looks at me, a warning 
flashing in her eyes.

&quot;She told you what?&quot; Uncle looks at Mireille. She glares back at him and 
slams down the seal on the dresser.

&quot;I&#39;m going to make more tea.&quot; She whirls and leaves the room. He turns 
to me and nods his head in encouragement.

&quot;She told her...that she should be ashamed of herself. That she was bred 
to be...better than this.&quot; I can barely get the words out. Am I some 
object of shame? Is that why Mireille is upset?

&quot;Uncle... is Mirelle...&quot; I try to find the words, but am too tired.

He clears his throat, and tucks away his notepad. He gets up slowly, 
leaning heavily onto his cane. I can see the pain flash across his face.

&quot;Mireille Bouquet was born to be a very wealthy and powerful young 
woman, if she so chooses.&quot; He leans forward and ruffles my hair. &quot;It&#39;s 
in her bloodline.&quot; His lip twitches, and his entire face looks troubled.

&quot;And that, now coupled with her pairing with you, is more than enough 
for some people to see her as a tremendous threat.&quot;

His hand runs over my hair, and tucks the sticky parts behind my ear.

&quot;And you have become ...&quot;

&quot;A target.&quot; I whisper.</pre>
