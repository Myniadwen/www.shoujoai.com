<h1>Meet the Parent (part 12 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Preparation days were over, and thoroughly today was Saturday, which 
meant the departure day to leave for Mireille, Kirika and Doctor Naomi. 
The three of them left early in the morning to the airport due to reach 
the first flight to Japan. Neither Mireille nor Kirika knew the reason 
why they were brought into such hurry to go to Japan, tough none of them 
willing to ask the person responsible for it, Dr. Naomi. Since that was 
the case, Mireille let herself thought that the female vet was an 
extraordinary morning person.

The plane they would be taking on was ready as soon as they arrived at 
the airport. Bringing the little luggage with them, Mireille, Kirika and 
Dr. Naomi got into the plane right away. Sat in the edge of the chair, 
as the one closest to the window was Mireille. Next to the blonde, now 
sitting mutely like a statue was the Japanese girl, while right after 
her was the oldest girl from the three, Doctor Naomi.

As the day was pretty early, none of them had gained the spirit to show 
their enthusiasm or rather, talked. The time when the plane took off, 
silence spread all over the flying machine&#39;s cabin as most passengers 
fall asleep, and few others talking politely, while many children from 
the back, full of spirit as they would always be, chattering loudly in 
their own language, some of whom the sound of laughter were disturbing 
enough to make anyone glanced in annoyance at least two times at them.

Mireille, being stuck in the corner of the seat, could not help but let 
her gaze fall at the blurry white scenery out of the window. As the 
blonde was not one to be practically amazed and worship nature to begin 
with, she could not help but felt bored immediately. Glanced to her 
lovers beside, Mireille smiled when she saw the Japanese girl&#39;s adorable 
face when sleeping. Looked further, she could also see Dr. Naomi&#39;s 
innocent face while sleeping soundly.

No matter how many times the blonde tried to sleep, it never worked out 
for her. Sighing at her lack of sleepiness, Mireille wiggled in her 
chair softly, trying to make herself comfortable, once again. The next 
moment, she felt her fingers were hold by a small, white cold hand. 
Mireille looked on her right just to see Kirika&#39;s eyes opened up, slowly 
looking back at her.

&quot;Can&#39;t sleep..?&quot; the brunette whispered softly.

Mireille smiled and placed her other hand above Kirika&#39;s, covering the 
brunette from the cool. &quot;Uh huh.. Why did you wake up..?&quot;

&quot;..No reason..&quot;

&quot;Are you sure..? Aren&#39;t you cold..?&quot; Mireille asked softly, as she was 
aware that her lovers&#39; hand felt like spreading icy heat from an ice 
cube.

&quot;No..&quot; Kirika muttered. &quot;I&#39;m just thinking... to use your shoulder..&quot; 
the Japanese girl whispered timidly.

Mireille chuckled. &quot;You don&#39;t have to wake up for it, Kirika. Don&#39;t you 
usually ask more than my shoulder..?&quot; the blonde asked in a naughty 
tone.

Kirika blushed madly and said nothing in return. Smiling, Mireille 
placed her hand on the Japanese girl&#39;s head and leaned it over to her 
shoulder. &quot;Now rest.&quot;

With Kirika sleeping peacefully on her shoulder, and their hands 
clutched together tightly, the blonde slowly felt like able to sleep. 
Unfortunately, her mind refused and wandered to the source reason why 
she felt restless, even now, in the early of the morning. Slowly but 
clearly, her memory once again revealed and reflected every detail on 
her last conversation two days ago, with Chloe.

-------------------------------------

&quot;Why did you say it like that..?&quot; Mireille asked, confused.

&quot;There&#39;s hardly anything you know. Don&#39;t you realize?&quot; the purple haired 
announced calmly.

&quot;Stop playing secret with me already! Can you?!&quot; Mireille shouted, 
pretty annoyed.

&quot;..Right.&quot; Chloe finally muttered.

&quot;So, what is with this dangerous trip..?&quot; asked the blonde, impatient.

&quot;There will be someone threatening your life..and Kirika.&quot;

&quot;That is usual.&quot; Mireille stated. &quot;We are assassins.&quot;

&quot;Soldats.&quot;

Hearing the name, Mireille&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;What does it have to do with 
Soldats?&quot; she asked sharply.

&quot;..They want your life.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re saying that they gonna do it the day we go to Japan..?&quot;

&quot;.. something like that.&quot;

&quot;Well.. The one that made me even more curious is..&quot; Mireille paused. 
&quot;Why, you&#39;re telling me this?&quot; she emphasized the word &#39;you&#39;, and looked 
directly at the purple haired girl&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I will always protect Kirika.&quot;

A brief silence stretched between them. Chloe&#39;s sentence simply did not 
straightly answer the question.

&quot;..You haven&#39;t told me something important. Is that right..?&quot; asked 
Mireille. &quot;What is it you&#39;ve been very enigmatic about? Enough with your 
hint act and words! I understand none of it.&quot;

&quot;..That&#39;s true. I should have told you sooner.&quot; Chloe suddenly muttered 
softly, her voice pretty convincing that she felt like apologizing. 
&quot;But..&quot; her voice became cold again.

Mireille gave her a look of questioning, mixed with a little anger.

&quot;You won&#39;t believe me.&quot; whispered Chloe, sighing.

&quot;Try me.&quot;

Looked up to Mireille, Chloe focused her eyes on the blonde&#39;s big orbs. 
&quot;First, one thing you must completely understand is that I&#39;m doing this 
for Kirika. No one else.&quot;

Being pulled in a heavy silence once again, Mireille decided to give a 
small nod for answer.

&quot;Since you and Kirika left the Manor. There were conflicts everywhere, 
especially among Soldats.&quot;

Mireille smiled slightly. It was true that since Kirika and her got over 
with the incident in the Manor, they decided to be free and worked once 
again as a normal assassins. They had showed Soldats the strong bond 
between them, and proved who the one that lose. Occasionally, they did 
get sudden attacks out of nowhere from Soldats, that for sure, but 
still, the two of them managed to survive.

Chloe continued. &quot;They lost their precious hope, Kirika, and refused to 
give it up to you. Still until now. Don&#39;t you feel weird to not having 
someone attacking your back..?&quot;

Mireille felt stupid for slightly shook her head.

&quot;I guess not. Secretly, Soldats turned out a plan to kill you. They&#151;&quot;

&quot;Wait.&quot; Mireille cut. &quot;Won&#39;t you be involved in that plan..?&quot;

&quot;I will not do such thing. It will make Kirika sad..&quot; Chloe&#39;s voice 
seemed like she was fall into her own world.

The blonde decided to shut her mouth and waited.

&quot;Rather, I&#39;m telling you what they may do.&quot; the purple haired girl&#39;s 
voice told that she was back to the reality world.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it make you.. a traitor? You&#39;re Altena&#39;s.. child.&quot; said 
Mireille, a bit cautious with her word.

&quot;I&#39;m doing this for Kirika, I told you before.&quot; Chloe replied coldly, 
and continued afterwards. &quot;I myself don&#39;t know for sure what they will 
do exactly. But I do know that they will do it during your trip. And I 
warned you, don&#39;t underestimate their effort this time.&quot;

&quot;Is their target.. only me..?&quot;

&quot;So far I know, yes.&quot;

&quot;Why..?&quot; the blonde asked in a complete mystify.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Kirika is more precious than you, you know.&quot;

Ignoring all annoying words from Chloe, Mireille decided to just end 
this silly conversation and said calmly, &quot;Okay. Thanks for your 
cooperation.&quot;

&quot;Actually.. There&#39;s one more thing.&quot;

&quot;..What?&quot;

-----------------------------

&quot;Mireille.. Mireille.&quot; someone&#39;s voice and the shaking on her own 
shoulder woke the blonde&#39;s up. She did not realize that she was in fact 
had fell asleep, like everybody else did.

Mireille opened her eyes, and saw Kirika was smiling to her.

&quot;Sorry to wake you up. But you must eat.&quot; the Japanese girl whispered 
softly. &quot;It&#39;s already late for lunch.&quot;

&quot;Oh.. Okay.&quot; the blonde mumbled, looking at the lunch pack in front of 
her, which definitely was not appealing. Sighing, Mireille took her 
spoon lazily.

&quot;Bad dream..??&quot; the brunette&#39;s voice echoed in the blonde&#39;s ears.

&quot;..Hmm.&quot;

Either the mood or the food itself that was not right at the moment, 
Mireille thought the food did not feel a slightest bit tasty. She 
managed to eat almost all of it, though. Felt stiff on the leg, Mireille 
decided to relax her feet and walk around a bit. Even with the stiffness 
she felt almost all over her leg, her frustrated inner mind refused to 
leave unnoticeable by the blonde.

&quot;I&#39;ll wander around. Do you want to come?&quot; the blonde asked her lovers.

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Mind if we go for some minutes, Doctor..?&quot; Mireille looked at Dr. 
Naomi, who still eating her meal.

&quot;No. Go ahead.&quot; the female vet said, smiling.

Curing stiff legs would not be a difficult matter, as the plane they 
were on in was huge enough. Despite caf&eacute;s, lounges, bars, shops, and 
more else, there was still more other facility to see, or rather to walk 
to, in the plane. But killing the devastating feeling she was feeling 
would be a different matter.

Walking passed the seats, Mireille could see everyone was already 
lively. It was not that noises were everywhere, but at least, there were 
not that many people who slept like a rock, except children. As their 
destination was Japan, there were a lot of passengers looked like an 
Asian from their black hair, black brown skin, or rather, shinny skin.

&quot;There are pretty much Asian people, eh..&quot; said Mireille.

&quot;Yeah..&quot;

The two of them walked slowly, and stopped at one of the caf&eacute; inside the 
plane. As Mireille threw herself at one of its chair, Kirika followed 
and did the same, placing herself right beside the blonde.

&quot;How do you feel..?&quot; the blonde asked. &quot;Going back to your hometown?&quot;

&quot;Hmm.. So so.&quot;

Mireille smiled and looked at the Japanese girl&#39;s brown orbs seriously. 
&quot;Actually, Kirika. There&#39;s something I want to talk to you.&quot;

The brunette replied the gaze she was given softly. &quot;What is it, 
Mireille?&quot;

&quot;Well.. Once when you were working, Chloe came to the apartment. She 
told me that on this trip to Japan.. there will be enemies. Soldats.&quot; 
the Corsican girl tried to keep her voice as calm as she could.

Kirika replied nothing and kept impassive.

&quot;She said not to underestimate them.&quot;

The Japanese girl nodded slowly. &quot;Is it possible even in the plane..?&quot;

&quot;..Yes.&quot;

&quot;That means.. Doctor Naomi is.. in danger, right?&quot; Kirika suddenly 
strengthen her gaze and asked in a tone that reflected a bit anger. &quot;Why 
don&#39;t you tell me sooner, Mireille..? Maybe.. We could just delay this 
plan. We cannot bring anyone to our problems. We must g&#151;&quot;

&quot;..Wait.&quot; answered the blonde weakly. She had already known and also, 
feared that the brunette would be mad at her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just..&quot; 
the blonde stopped talking, not knowing what to say.

What should I tell her..??

&quot;..What is it, Mireille..?&quot; Kirika asked, her tone showed clear 
impatient. The brunette was already standing, ready to run at her seat.

&quot;..Are you.. mad?&quot; the blonde asked in a low voice.

Realizing that she had caused Mireille fear from the way the blonde 
talked to her, Kirika suddenly felt regret. &quot;No, Mireille. I&#39;m just.. 
upset.&quot; she said softly, her eyes slowly softened from the way she 
looked at her lovers before. &quot;You better.. promise me not to go on at 
something without telling me first.&quot;

The blonde heaved a sigh of relief. &quot;I won&#39;t, I promise. There is reason 
why I did it, Kirika. And, you can relax. Dr. Naomi won&#39;t be.. in 
danger.&quot;

----------------------------

&quot;Okay. Thanks for your cooperation.&quot;

&quot;Actually.. There&#39;s one more thing.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;...You got to be extremely careful..&quot; Chloe stopped talking for a 
second. &quot;There is a saying that said, &#39;Your enemy may be right in front 
of your eyes&#39;..&quot;

&quot;Chloe. Please stop talking way over longer the topic. Just tell me.&quot;

&quot;...Well..&quot;

Tough it was definitely rare and at the same time weird, to see and hear 
Chloe mumbled, Mireille decided to care not about it.

&quot;What?!&quot; Mireille asked, totally curious now.

&quot;Soldats member..&quot;

Mireille raised her eyebrows and stared at the purple haired girl, 
motioning her to quicken.

&quot;..that Naomi is one of them.&quot;

What?!

As if it was the first time to even hear some words, Mireille&#39;s mind 
went blank. Had the purple haired girl told her sooner when she herself 
doubted the female vet, she would trust her right away. But now, being a 
kind, generous woman, an understandable mother, Mireille no longer felt 
that kind of impression for Doctor Naomi.

Long silence hung between them, as Mireille stared at Chloe in complete 
disbelief, while the latter&#39;s expression was generally.. cold. Did not 
know who to trust anymore, the blonde sank in great confusion of her 
self-thought.

&quot;That&#39;s.. nonsense.&quot; Mireille finally let out some words out of her 
lips. &quot;Doctor Naomi?&quot;

Chloe sighed. &quot;I should have kill her at that time..&quot;

&quot;What time?&quot; Mireille snapped abruptly.

&quot;..The time before I returned that fat cat.&quot;

&quot;You are.. crazy. If she is really Soldats, then she must be your 
companion, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;I told you, everything for Kirika.&quot; Chloe said coldly, bored.

Once again Mireille felt the urge to grab the purple haired kid and 
swung her around like a lasso, then let it go from the highest floor of 
her apartment. Chloe sure had regained her mean and cold attitude, after 
releasing the information she kept long to Mireille.

&quot;Wait a minute.. be a Soldats member doesn&#39;t mean that she is bad..&quot; 
muttered the blonde. &quot;Right..?&quot;

&quot;..You can judge yourself. From my point, she sure is the key point to 
annihilate you.&quot;

&quot;What advantage does she have to disguise as Kirika&#39;s mother, if that&#39;s 
true..?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. But one thing, she succeeded to make you trust her 
enough.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Then why are you telling me this just now..? Not when we&#151;&quot;

Mireille&#39;s word was stuck as she saw Chloe was glaring at her. &quot;I risk 
my life just to tell you that. Now.&quot;

&quot;..Oh.&quot; mumbled the blonde, regretting her stupid words. She must be 
careless to forget that Chloe was Altena&#39;s dearest child. &quot;..sorry and.. 
thanks.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your own business, your safety. All I have to do is take care of 
Kirika. I hope you do the best.&quot; Chloe stood up. &quot;That&#39;s all, now&#151;&quot;

&quot;Wait! Doctor Naomi has all photos of Kirika&#39;s childhood, birth 
certificate, and others! I saw it myself..!&quot;

&quot;It is all.. fake.&quot; Chloe stated.

&quot;How?!&quot; the blonde asked loudly, felt left behind.

&quot;..Technology.&quot;

&quot;Her face!&quot; Mireille almost exclaimed in frustration. &quot;What could you 
say? She..&#151;&quot; the light of dubious from blonde&#39;s eyes slowly faded. She 
kind of expected the answer.

&quot;Surgery. What else?&quot;

&quot;.. The old family.. history..?&quot; Mireille asked slowly, not really 
wanted to know the answer.

&quot;It&#39;s all fake. I told you. She made it all up.&quot;

Mireille was left wordless. Her instinct suddenly told her that there 
was high possibility that the female vet was not Kirika&#39;s mother. But, 
looking back at Chloe&#39;s background as Altena&#39;s favourite daughter, and 
her own dislike at the purple haired girl.. she doubted it, just a 
little, though. From the situation, Chloe got the point which made it 
unbelievably likely to be true. But, another possibility was if all the 
arrogant kid was also a lie, and she planned something. Which one was 
it..?

I don&#39;t know what to say.. nor to do.. Whom should I believe in..? 
Fortunately this is me.. what if Kirika is the one hearing it..?

And, where will Kirika be brought to, if the old family is nothing but 
fake..?

--------------------------

A few minute her mind&#39;s traveling through the conversation she had with 
Chloe made Mireille&#39;s brain boiling. So many questions unanswered. The 
blonde did not let her wandering thought took the best of her this time, 
as she was now facing her lovers, who still did not know anything.

&quot;Kirika.. Do you trust Chloe?&quot;

The latter nodded slowly for the reply and slowly took a sit beside the 
blonde.

&quot;What about.. Doctor Naomi? You trust her..?&quot;

&quot;..Yes. Why?&quot;

She trusts almost everybody nice to her, for crying out loud..!

&quot;You know.. the saying that your enemy may be right in front of you..?&quot; 
Mireille aware that she copied Chloe&#39;s way of explaining, but for now 
she cared not about it, as it seemed to be the best solution for this 
thing she must tell, after all.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;That means Soldats are everywhere, right?&quot;

&quot;.. True.&quot;

&quot;What if.. we are now trapped in Soldats&#39; plan..?&quot;

Partly my fault, it is.. I don&#39;t understand how I still agree to join 
this trip, after hearing all that..

&quot;..What do you mean, Mireille..?&quot;

The blonde hesitated. &quot;What if.. Just if.. A possibility.. high 
possibility.. no. not really high. It&#39;s&#151;&quot;

Mireille&#39;s hand started to shake a little, her heart pounded very hard, 
her feet and palms felt cold, her skin felt sweaty. Almost all her 
organs betrayed her to look calm in front the Japanese girl.

&quot;Mireille? Are you okay..?&quot; the brunette asked, confused.

&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot; the blonde answered quickly. &quot;Kirika. What if.. I&#39;m telling 
you that..&quot; she paused and gulped. &quot;that.. Chloe said, Doctor Naomi is 
Soldats..?&quot;

Finally letting out what troubling her mind, the blonde felt a little 
more relax, but at the same time nervous to face what would happen 
afterwards.

To Mireille&#39;s surprise, Kirika still wore her usual calm expression, not 
looked like surprise at all, despite her widen eyes. Minutes passed, and 
Kirika had replied nothing to the blonde.

Seeing that her lovers&#39; eyes reflected deep confusion and sadness, 
Mireille took one of her lovers hand and gently squeezed it. &quot;Kirika..? 
You okay..?&quot;

Yet still not a word came out from the Japanese girl.

Mireille caressed the brunette&#39;s cheek. &quot;It&#39;s just.. what Chloe said. 
I&#39;m not too sure about it, too.&quot; encouraged the blonde softly. 
&quot;..Kirika..&quot;

Still no answer, but the blonde could see her lover&#39;s eyes became a bit 
teary.

..Don&#39;t tell me she already knows about it..

&quot;Kirika.. Do you.. already know..?&quot;

&quot;..No.&quot; the brunette finally whispered weakly, clearly in the verge of 
tears.

Knowing that her lovers was pretty close to cry, Mireille hugged the 
brunette right in time before the Japanese girls shaking shoulder broke 
into pieces of fallen tears.

&quot;Kirika..&quot; Mireille gently stroked the brunette&#39;s brown hair. &quot;You.. 
believe it, don&#39;t you..?&quot;

A few minutes of soft sobbing, the brunette managed to say a simple, 
&quot;..Yes.&quot;

&quot;..It must... hurts..&quot; mumbled the blonde.

&quot;..Very.&quot; Kirika sobbed and continued. &quot;I.. don&#39;t know why..&quot; the 
Japanese girl once again cried a little louder.

&quot;Shh.. Calm, Kirika..&quot;

&quot;The moment.. you told me.. I knew it..&quot; the brunette whispered in the 
middle of her cry.

Admitted Kirika&#39;s innate sixth sense, Mireille could not help but felt 
like more and more trusting that Doctor Naomi was not the Japanese 
girl&#39;s mother. Tough she did not expect the brunette to just believe it 
right away.

Could it be.. that she already feels something about it..?

Mireille was about to ask her lovers about what she really felt to Dr. 
Naomi as mother before, but was delayed by Kirika&#39;s whisper.

&quot;..Maybe.. I really shouldn&#39;t have or hope for parents.. Even for a 
single mother.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s pronunciation of the word &#39;mother&#39; was very desperate, it made 
Mireille felt regret to ever tell her. Sank into deep agony and sadness, 
the two of them fall and snuggled into each other embrace, not realizing 
how time had passed.

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Kirika..&quot;

And how there was already someone watching them from the beginning.</pre>
