<h1>You Remember</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leet911.html">LeeT911</a><br> </h2>
<pre>You remember standing in the schoolyard and watching the other girls 
walk by.  You remember seeing the younger children running around in 
the playground.  You wondered  if you will ever have friends.  You 
wondered if you will ever know anything but loneliness.

You remember that time in front of the university library, the bright 
sky and the warm sun on your face.  You remember the couple sitting on 
the bench, sharing a quiet moment together.  You wondered what it was 
like to be in love.  You wondered what it was like to have any love at 
all.

How na&iuml;ve you were then.

You found love.  Or what you thought was love.  And it was beautiful.  
For a long while, there was nothing but pleasure, nothing but beauty.  
Nothing but quiet walks in the moonlit streets of Paris, followed by 
tender nights of sleeplessness.

Where did it all go wrong?  When did the silence become unbearable?  
When did Mireille ever need so much more?  She wanted so much that you 
couldn&#146;t give her, simply because of who you were.  It&#146;s not your 
fault.  She never stopped reminding you of that, but it didn&#146;t change 
the fact that you still loved her.

You still miss her.

~[]~

Kirika runs her hand over the smooth cool metal of the doorknob, her 
fingertips dancing, searching.  She does not know what she is looking 
for.  There is no lingering warmth on the brass-coloured ball.  The 
door to the apartment she once shared with her partner stands 
resolutely in front of her, denying her passage.

It&#146;s been nearly a year since she left.  A year she spent back in 
school, in Japan.  A year spent learning.  A year wasted on longing.  
She still didn&#146;t fit in.  Despite everything Mireille had taught her, 
she still wasn&#146;t the equal of the other girls in her school.  In some 
respects she was better, she excelled in areas they couldn&#146;t dream of.  
Socially though, she was wreck.  No friends, no family, no loved 
ones... except for...  But it hurt so much to think of Mireille.

Kirika sighs.  She doesn&#146;t know what she&#146;s doing back in Paris.  It is 
the holiday season, and the streets are filled with decorations, with 
smiling people, with the Christmas spirit, yet her soul feels so very 
empty.  Her heart feels as cold as the slippery doorknob she is 
hopelessly clutching.

For a moment, she loses her resolve, her hand falls away.  Her back 
slumps against the door, head angled high, as if pleading to a greater 
power.  Her body slides down the length of the door, finally coming to 
rest when she is sitting on the floor.  It is frigid.  She can feel 
the cold seeping through her pants.  No carpeting in the halls of this 
apartment building. Beside her, the gift she bought Mireille sits 
peacefully in its sparkly red wrapping paper.  Its ribbons&#146; perfect 
silvery-white curls mock Kirika in her weakness.

With her head against he door, she can hear water running inside the 
apartment.  Mireille is in the shower.  For a few minutes, Kirika just 
sits there.  Despite the cold floor and the tightness in her legs, she 
spends a long time listening to the soothing sound of splashing water.  
She buries her hands in her coat pockets, closes her eyes.

~[]~

You remember how much Mireille cared for you that time you got shot.  
You remember the agony when simply standing up was too painful.  But 
that pain was only physical.  Most of all, you remember Mireille 
washing you gently while you sat in the tub half-unconscious, lost in 
the drugged daze of painkillers.  You wonder what she made of it then.  
Probably nothing at all.   But it meant so much to you.  It meant so 
much to you that she cared at all.

You remember the first time Mireille kissed you.  You were so scared, 
so nervous... so hopelessly in love.  You remember the feel of holding 
something alive.  The warmth, the movements, all of it was so 
beautiful, the way Mireille squirmed whenever you held her tightly.  
You never knew any other way of holding her.  You were clinging to the 
brief happiness you found.

You still are clinging.

~[]~

Kirika&#146;s eyes flutter open, wetness visible around the edges.  She 
blinks several times, vainly trying to be rid of the threatening 
tears.  Her hands rummage around her pockets, looking for the key as 
she stands up slowly.

She finds the old apartment key in her back pocket, slips it 
unceremoniously into the keyhole.  Hesitation.  She&#146;s not supposed to 
be doing this.  Not anymore.  It bothers her somewhat, but not enough 
to stop her.  Kirika gathers up her gift, composes herself, turns the 
key.

The apartment hasn&#146;t changed.  The pool table still dominates most of 
the space, Mireille&#146;s computer resting atop the velvet surface.  A few 
balls are also littered over the tabletop.  The yellow scooter leans 
in its customary position by the window.  The same window Kirika used 
to spend endless hours in front of, staring blankly into space.  The 
table by the window, however, is conspicuously empty.  The potted 
plant that once resided there gone.

Kirika closes the door softly, keenly aware that the shower is still 
running.  The bathroom door is slightly ajar, steam from the interior 
wafting out into the apartment.  Mireille is humming a tune as she 
washes.  A melody that Kirika does not recognize, yet the sound is 
very pleasing to her ears.

She walks over to the pool table, her assassin&#146;s instincts keeping her 
footsteps eerily quiet.  Shedding her heavy winter coat, she drapes it 
over Mireille&#146;s desk.  Beneath her dark coat, the clothes she wears 
are black as well.  She doesn&#146;t remember when she had taken to 
exclusively wearing this colour -- the colour of mourning.  Noir, the 
colour of her hands.

~[]~

You remember running in the forest with gunfire at your heels.  You 
remember popcorn in a dark hotel casino.  You remember slitting a 
man&#146;s throat with a plastic card. You remember climbing an endless 
flight of stairs towards dozens of armed men.  You remember lashing 
out with the wheel axle of a toy truck.  You remember the pathetic 
ease with which all those enemies died.

Killing was so... effortless.  Murder was something you did on reflex.  
You were better than Chloe even.  When all she had was hate, you had 
love.  How could someone so strong, be so weak?  Is it any wonder at 
all, that someone who dealt in death was so inept at love?

You remember the first time Mireille held you.  You were so afraid.  
You didn&#146;t know what to do, what to say.  But it felt so good.  It 
felt so right.  It felt like you had been waiting your entire life for 
that moment.

You still are waiting.

~[]~

Feeling guilty for snooping, but unable to help herself, Kirika 
wanders around the apartment, still clutching the small red package in 
her hands.  The smell of tea permeates the kitchen, but the kettle is 
empty.  A quick glance shows a mug in the sink, teabag still sitting 
in it.  A pity.  She would have liked to have some.  She slips back 
out.

Kirika stands on her toes, leans over the wall to look at the unmade 
bed.  New clothes are strewn all over it, price tags still hanging on 
some of them.  Numerous shopping bags are next to the bed, some empty, 
some still quite full.  Mireille obviously indulged herself.

Kirika&#146;s tour is short-lived, as the small apartment takes only a few 
minutes go through.  Unwillingly, she finds herself drawn towards the 
bathroom, where Mireille is still engaged in one of her long showers.  
At first, Kirika thinks only of closing the door properly.  Perhaps 
she should just leave her gift, and go before the blonde finds her 
here.

Mireille is still humming when Kirika comes to the doorway, the hand 
reaching out to close the door inadvertently knocking it further open.  
The blonde doesn&#146;t notice, she is too busy rinsing out her hair.  
Kirika steps just inside the bathroom, finally gets her hand on the 
doorknob.  The sight of Mireille stops her.

Despite the intervening shower curtain, and the haze of steam, Kirika 
still finds her former partner overwhelming.  Unconsciously, she holds 
her breath, afraid that Mireille will somehow sense her presence.  The 
blurred figure behind the shower curtain goes about its business 
obliviously.  The soft patter of water striking the bottom of the 
bathtub is drowned out by Mireille&#146;s humming.  Such a beautiful sound.

Kirika wallows in the heavy moist air, the muggy sauna-like sensation 
reminiscent of being in love.  With the warm steam surrounding her, 
she loses herself once again in nostalgia.

~[]~

You remember sitting awake in bed, shrouded in the deepest night.  
Beside you, Mireille was pretending to be asleep.  You could tell.  
You could always tell.  You wondered why.  You wondered why you were 
so attuned to her.

You remember turning away, so that your legs dangled off the side of 
the bed.  You remember looking back at her resting form and yearning.  
She was so beautiful.  There were so many things you wanted to tell 
her that you could never bring yourself to say.  There were so many 
things you wished you could do, things you wished you hadn&#146;t done.

You remember crying that night.  You cried so very softly, but she 
must have heard you.  You remember the bed creaking as she shifted her 
weight, put her arms around you.  You remember her breath on your neck 
as she whispered your name, asked you what was wrong.  You wondered 
why she cared about this little slip of a girl.  You wondered why it 
mattered to her when you were unhappy.

And you dared to hope.

~[]~

Kirika lets out her breath, makes a small, almost imperceptible noise.  
She backs out of the bathroom, closing the door behind her.  The 
sounds from the shower become muted.  She is tired, all of a sudden, 
and she doesn&#146;t know why.  Absently, she runs a hand through her mop 
of dark hair.  She pulls at the sleeves of her sweater, rolls them up 
to her elbows.  The steam has made her all damp and clammy.

Glancing down at her gift, she sees that the once proud curls of 
ribbon have also wilted in the humidity.  Dejectedly, she hurls the 
small box across the apartment.  It strikes the far wall, ricochets 
off, lands on the bed.  The muffled thud of it hitting the mattress is 
singularly unsatisfying.

Out of habit, Kirika wanders over to the window, rests her arms on the 
sill, cups her chin in her hands.  Snow is falling on the streets of 
Paris.  Overcast skies sprinkle large white flakes liberally over he 
city.  The sight entrances her.  She watches individual snowflakes 
flutter up to the window and drift across on unseen currents before 
continuing their dreamy descent.

Like a child outside a toy store, she presses her face against the 
frosty glass.  The snow is so white, so pure... so unlike her.  Its 
untainted form scorns her innocent facade.  But like her, the snow is 
cold.  So very cold.

Gripped by a sudden indescribable urge, Kirika opens the window.  
Freezing blasts of air buffet her unkempt locks, raising goose bumps 
on her exposed forearms.  Wintry gusts of wind blow into the 
apartment, carrying with them the precious snowflakes.  Little white 
flecks swirl around, melting as they stray too far from the window.  
Kirika stands up straight, throws her arms out, surrenders herself 
fully to the cleansing icy wind.

~[]~

You remember sitting underneath a tree, with Mireille&#146;s arms draped 
languidly over your shoulders.  You remember telling her that you 
should go, pointing to the storm clouds that were building up 
overhead.  She ignored you.  Grabbed your hand instead, pulled you 
close.

You remember the first few raindrops filtering through the leaves and 
landing on your back.  You remember the wind howling around you as 
Mireille caressed your face.  You remember smiling in the rain as you 
ran your fingers through her dripping blonde hair.  You remember 
thunder sounding in your ears as she kissed you.  You remember 
lightning flashing brightly in the sky as she pressed her drenched 
body firmly against yours.  You remember falling backwards, onto the 
damp ground, with Mireille crawling over you, her hands pinning your 
wrists in what was fast becoming mud.  Despite the rain, despite the 
storm, despite the sopping clothes clinging to her form, she still 
radiated some rugged beauty.

You remember Mireille shaking her head to clear the wet hair from her 
face, leaning down to kiss to your neck.  You remember squeezing your 
eyes shut when she touched that perfect spot.

You never wanted that storm to end.

~[]~

&#147;I&#146;ll catch cold if you don&#146;t close that window.&#148;

Kirika obeys the voice instinctively, her quick hands already closing 
the latches before she realizes who is speaking to her.

Mireille stands casually, arms crossed and head cocked to one side, 
despite the fact that she is wearing nothing more than a towel.  
Another towel is wrapped around the top of her head, concealing her 
hair.

&#147;I... I&#146;m sorry.&#148;  Kirika stutters, out of surprise and nervousness 
rather than embarrassment.

&#147;I see you let yourself in.&#148;  No accusation in Mireille&#146;s voice.

&#147;I wanted to see you again.&#148;  And it was true.  It hurt so much to 
look at her, but it was true.

&#147;Can you give me a minute to get dressed?&#148;

&#147;Mmm.&#148;  Kirika gives a slight nod, averts her eyes as Mireille makes 
her to the bed and gathers up some clothes.  A year ago, she would 
have thought nothing of watching Mireille dress, but now...  It was as 
though she needed permission.  But then again, what had she expected?  
That Mireille would jump into her arms?

The blonde dresses quickly, efficiently, picking out new clothes at 
random.  She spots the red package on her bed, not one of hers.  The 
box is dented, damaged.  She thinks better than to speak of it.  
Kirika, meanwhile, had turned her attention back to the window.  
Mireille had never known what the girl saw out there.  Always the same 
street, the same buildings, the same melancholic sky.

Yuumura Kirika.  There was so much Mireille didn&#146;t know about the 
Japanese girl.  How long had they been together?  A year?  More.  And 
still, Kirika remained a mystery.  There were so many things she never 
told Mireille.  Yes, she was shy.  And yes, she was naturally quiet.  
But at some point, the silence had just been too much.  The lack of 
words between them haunted Mireille in ways she never thought 
possible.  She never tired of Kirika&#146;s voice.  She needed it.  Needed 
to hear it just to remind herself that the girl she spent her time 
with wasn&#146;t the same one that killed her parents.  Mireille needed to 
know that Kirika had changed, that Kirika cared.  And it wasn&#146;t enough 
just to know, she needed a constant reminder.

So insecure.  Despite all her talents as world-renowned assassin, 
Mireille was deeply insecure when it came to love.  Perhaps as scared 
as Kirika herself was.  But now, with Kirika in her apartment again, 
she finds herself remembering the happy times they had shared here.  
She finds her gaze drawn to Kirika&#146;s back

The dark-haired girl listens to Mireille&#146;s shuffling behind her, 
counting the blonde&#146;s movements.  She knows that Mireille has finished 
dressing, knows that she is being observed.  Mireille takes a few 
steps towards her, standing close.  Too close?  Closer than she should 
be, but not close enough, not for Kirika.

&#147;That colour doesn&#146;t suit you.&#148;  The blonde says.

&#147;If only that were true.&#148;  Kirika retorts, spinning to face the 
critic.  Despite the edge in her voice, her eyes are soft.

Pause.  There is a long moment where they simply stare at each other, 
as if waiting for the other to make the first move, the first mistake.  
Mireille has chosen to wear white, the colour of purity.  To Kirika, 
that is already a lie, already a mistake.  She tries to distance 
herself her from Mireille, hardening her features, but to no avail.  
It seems to her that whenever she looks upon her partner, it is with 
pleading eyes.  Always asking for something, always waiting for 
something.  Kirika looks away, unable to bear the sight of Mireille so 
close to her.

&#147;I brought you something.&#148;  She mumbles at the floor.

&#147;I saw.  Thank you.&#148;

&#147;Aren&#146;t you going to open it?&#148;

&#147;Christmas isn&#146;t for another two days.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;  Kirika&#146;s eyes begin to wander around again.

&#147;I didn&#146;t get you anything since I didn&#146;t know you were coming, so let 
me buy you dinner instead.&#148;  Mireille suggests.

&#147;Mmm.&#148;

They grab their coats.

* * * * *

The cab ride goes by in utter silence.  The restaurant is a mere ten 
minutes away, and Kirika spends every second watching the snow fall on 
the landscape outside.  Several times, she thinks of saying something, 
starting a conversation, but she can&#146;t bring her mouth to form the 
words.  Mireille had always been the talkative one.  Mireille had 
always been the one to speak first.  Kirika finds herself unable to do 
something as simple as asking a question.

~[]~

You remember a train ride through the French countryside.  You were 
just as quiet, just as withdrawn.  But somehow, the silence then had 
been less strained.  The air hadn&#146;t hung heavy and pregnant.

You remember sitting next to Mireille and having her hand clasped in 
your lap.  She had given you the window seat.  She had wanted to point 
out all the sights for you.  You were so disinterested.  That time, it 
was Mireille that kept her eyes glued to the scenery.  You just kept 
looking at her, staring at her so intently that you broke her 
concentration, forced her to consider you.

You were so flattered when you won out, so thrilled that Mireille 
found you more fascinating than whatever panoramic &#147;paysage&#148; lay 
outside.  You remember spending half the ride in complete stillness, 
lost in Mireille&#146;s eyes.  She seemed so gentle, so soft.  You remember 
desperately wanting to touch her face, but being morbidly afraid to do 
so.  You wondered what it was she saw in you.  You wondered what it 
was that made her care.  You didn&#146;t know.  You couldn&#146;t ask her.  You 
never found out.

But you never stopped wanting her attention.

~[]~

Mireille regrets picking this restaurant the instant they step through 
the door.  They used to eat here all the time.  It was one of her 
favourite places, but she didn&#146;t come here often anymore.  All of it 
was too familiar, too filled with memories.  At Mireille&#146;s request, 
the waiter leads them to a table in the corner, far from their usual 
spot by the window.

He returns a few minutes later, notepad in hand, ready to take their 
order.  Kirika waits, expecting Mireille to order for her, like 
always.  The blonde doesn&#146;t.  She lets Kirika decide on her own.  
Caught by surprise, the younger girl ends up ordering the same thing 
as her partner.

Dinner progresses slowly, both of them picking at their seafood meals 
and trying unsuccessfully to lighten the mood.  After the requisite 
&#147;how have you been?&#148;, &#147;where are you staying?&#148;, and &#147;how long?&#148;, 
Mireille ran out of things to say.  She didn&#146;t know what to else to 
ask.  She recalls a time when she could talk easily to Kirika.  A time 
when she would ramble on enthusiastically about whatever happened to 
strike her at the moment.  Where did that carefree spirit go?

Mireille looks down despondently at her half empty plate and sighs.  
The reaction is not lost on the girl facing her.

&#147;Are you finished?&#148;  She asks suddenly.

&#147;Yes.&#148;  Kirika answers, even though she&#146;s not.  But she&#146;s not hungry 
anyway.

Mireille lifts her glass of wine and downs the remaining liquid in one 
gulp.   &#147;Let&#146;s go.&#148;

&#147;What about dessert?&#148;  Kirika doesn&#146;t want to leave.  Even if the 
alternative is sitting here in silence.  Having dinner with Mireille 
was almost like a dream.  She just wanted to spend some time with the 
woman, just wanted to see her.

Mireille pauses, glances across at Kirika.  She finds herself feeling 
sorry for this downcast girl, this teenager forced into an adult world 
without first getting the chance to be a child.  In that instant, she 
wants nothing more than to buy this girl a balloon and some ice cream, 
she wants to spoil the girl, she wants her to have fun.  &#147;We&#146;ll go 
back to the apartment, I have some chocolate cake left.&#148;

* * * * *

Mireille stands on the curb, looking out onto the street.  She&#146;s about 
to wave down another cab when Kirika touches her elbow.

&#147;Can we walk instead?  The snow is so pretty.&#148;

&#147;If you like.  It&#146;s not that far.&#148;  The blonde pulls her coat tighter 
around herself, starts off after Kirika.

How strange it was, that Kirika should be the one to lead.  Mireille 
can&#146;t remember the last time the girl had actually walked ahead of 
her.  She was always one step behind, as if deferring to a higher 
authority.  Kirika always asked for permission before doing anything.  
Her little spurts of initiative were rare, to say the least, yet 
Mireille found them particularly endearing.

As she follows Kirika through the snow, Mireille finds herself 
thinking of another time, a long time ago.  There had been snow then 
also.  But that had been towards the end of it, the ugly part.  
Mostly, she remembers Kirika coming home with a paper bag in her arms, 
and a small cat hidden in the bag.   The girl had known that Mireille 
wouldn&#146;t approve, so she thought she could hide the animal.  Mireille 
still remembers the look on Kirika&#146;s face when the cat popped out.  
The expression innocent, helpless, so incredibly cute.

Mireille catches herself watching Kirika.  The Japanese girl is right 
beside her, eyes darting from side to side as she watches the 
snowflakes drift to the ground.  She seems strangely out of place, her 
black hair and clothes against the stark white snow.  It isn&#146;t the 
first time she witnesses a snowfall, but it still seems like the 
experience is magical to her.  Mireille envies her, marvelling at 
Kirika&#146;s ability to appreciate even the most mundane aspects of life.  
Simple little things meant so much to her.  Mireille sighs, wondering 
if she had been wrong to drive away Kirika.

Kirika turns at the sound of Mireille&#146;s exhalation.  The blonde hadn&#146;t 
noticed, but Kirika&#146;s arm had somehow linked through hers.  Similarly, 
Kirika&#146;s hand had also somehow managed to worm its way into Mireille&#146;s 
coat pocket, and her fingers were absently stroking Mireille&#146;s.

Embarrassed, the dark-haired girl withdraws her hand, quickly stuffing 
it back into her own pocket.  Her cheeks are ruddy from the cold, and 
she is obviously flushed.  &#147;I...  sorry...  I&#146;m sorry...  I...&#148;  She 
looks away, down at the ground where her shoes are digging into the 
snow.

&#147;Don&#146;t be.&#148;

Kirika doesn&#146;t meet Mireille&#146;s eyes, only picks up her pace, moving 
ahead.  The apartment is less than two blocks away.

&#147;Kirika, don&#146;t be sorry, not for that.  If anything, I should be 
sorry.&#148;  Mireille&#146;s voice sounds on the verge of breaking, and Kirika 
can&#146;t bring herself to look back.  She just pushes herself to walk 
faster, feeling the tears start to fill her eyes.

~[]~

You remember the day you left Paris.  You remember that perfect day.  
The sun was shining, the sky clear, the breeze gentle, even the 
temperature had been unseasonably warm.  It was as though fate had 
decided to pull one more obscene prank on you.

In truth, things had not been right for some time, but you could never 
point it out.  You could never admit to yourself that this wasn&#146;t how 
it was supposed to be.  Until that day.  What had been different that 
day?  Nothing really, but somehow, over the course of time, Mireille 
had drifted away from you.  She didn&#146;t talk as much anymore, she 
didn&#146;t seem to be sleeping well, she didn&#146;t seem to eat much either.  
It had gone on for a long time, but that day, you finally summoned up 
the courage to speak to her.

&#147;Mireille, what&#146;s wrong?&#148;

So simple, those three words.  But that was all it took.  You remember 
the agonizing look she gave you as she lifted her eyes from the 
computer screen.   You remember the endless stream of tears as she 
proceeded to tell you what was wrong.  These days, you only wonder 
what would have happened if you had never asked.  You wonder if you 
would be any happier.

&#147;You never talk to me, Kirika.  You never tell me what you like and 
what you don&#146;t.  You never tell me how you feel.  You always say you 
don&#146;t care or it doesn&#146;t matter.  Sometimes...  Sometimes all I can 
hear you say is, &#145;I don&#146;t care&#146;.  Sometimes I ask myself if you care 
about anything at all.&#148;

&#147;I care about you.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s so hard for me tell.&#148;

You remember how much she cried when she said that.  You remember how 
much it hurt you just to stand there and listen to her go on.  But you 
stood there, stoically, fighting the urge to cry yourself.  You stood 
there, strong, because at that moment, she wasn&#146;t.  You listened to 
everything she said, everything about the two of you, about yourself, 
and you saw that she was right,  She was right about everything.

&#147;Maybe you shouldn&#146;t stay here anymore.  Just for a while.  I need 
some time.&#148;

You remember running out of the apartment when she finally finished.  
You remember standing on the edge of the riverbank and thinking how 
easy it would be to end it all right here.  Just one jump, into the 
river, and let yourself go.  But you were scared, weren&#146;t you?  The 
greatest assassin in all the world was afraid.

You ran away.

~[]~

Kirika leans her forehead against the door of Mireille&#146;s apartment.  
The blonde&#146;s footsteps sound clearly on the stairs.  Kirika wants to 
get inside badly, to get away from Mireille, but her key is nowhere to 
be found.  She must have dropped it, or left it inside.

Mireille comes up at a sluggish pace.  She is nervous, scared even, of 
what she wants to tell Kirika. The girl is propped up, immobile 
against her door, crying in that silent way of hers.  Despite the fact 
that Mireille knows better, Kirika seems so very frail and vulnerable.  
Of their own accord, her hands land on the girl&#146;s shoulders.

Kirika tenses as Mireille touches her.  She knows she should twist 
away, get loose, but part of her desperately wants to be here, next to 
Mireille.

&#147;Do you remember the day you went away?&#148;  The words are whispered into 
Kirika&#146;s ear.  She doesn&#146;t answer, only shuts her eyes in a vain 
attempt to stop to the tears.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;  Mireille goes on.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry for telling you things I 
shouldn&#146;t have.  I&#146;m sorry for not seeing how much you cared for me.  
I&#146;m sorry for not realizing just how much I needed you.  I&#146;m sorry for 
letting you run away without telling you I loved you.&#148;  She too, 
closes her eyes, lets her arms slide around Kirika&#146;s neck as she 
presses closer.  &#147;Please don&#146;t hate me, Kirika.&#148;

The pleading in Mireille&#146;s voice causes Kirika to shudder.  She turns 
around to face Mireille, locking her arms around the blonde&#146;s waist.  
Kirika struggles to speak, knowing that any words will be inadequate.  
&#147;I don&#146;t hate you, Mireille.&#148;

For a long moment, they are silent, wrapped around each other.  
Kirika, with her back against the door, pushes up on her toes so that 
her chin rests on Mireille&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;I love you.&#148;  She whispers, 
her lips almost touching Mireille&#146;s ear.

You remember once wanting to ask Mireille why all the love stories you 
saw were between men and women.  Why did all the women&#146;s magazines 
only have tips for dating men?  Why did all the television shows only 
have romance between men and women?

You never found the courage to ask her.  You thought maybe you could 
find out on your own.  Eventually, you did learn.  You learned that 
the world looked upon love in a such a horrible hypocritical way.  You 
learned that maybe... maybe it was wrong for you to be in love...

But you couldn&#146;t deny it.

&#147;I love you, Kirika.&#148;  Mireille squeezes tightly as she says it, her 
fingers lacing their way into curls of dark hair.  &#147;I never told you 
that did I?&#148;

&#147;Not in those words.&#148;

Mireille pulls away so that she can look into Kirika&#146;s reddish-brown 
eyes.  There was a time she had found those strange impassive orbs 
unsettling.  But now, with wetness ringing her soft eyes, Kirika seems 
so much more human, so much more needy.

&#147;I love you, Mireille.  I never said it quite that way either.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not your fault.&#148;

Kirika embraces Mireille again, burying her face into the taller 
woman&#146;s neck.  Of it&#146;s own volition, her tongue darts out to tease 
Mireille&#146;s skin.  Suddenly, there are hands on Kirika&#146;s face, pulling 
her up into a deep kiss.   She tightens her thin arms even more, 
refusing to let go of her partner.

~[]~

You remember standing in this very same spot, with Mireille kissing 
you fiercely while fumbling to open the door with one hand.  You 
remember the wonderful squishy feeling you had in your belly.  You 
remember the warmth that shot through you every time her scintillating 
blue eyes drifted to yours, every time her skin brushed yours, every 
time your lips found each other.  You wondered if this was what is 
what like to be in love.  You wondered if Mireille felt the same way.

Now you know.
