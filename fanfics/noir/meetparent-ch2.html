<h1>Meet the Parent (part 2 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It was another sunny day, though the weather seemed to be rather dark 
than yesterday. The sun had shown itself, a common sign of a beginning 
of days. The apartment where the two live remained lazy as always, 
despite an anonymous black bird added into the house.

Mireille was the first to woke as she no longer can sleep since she 
heard the black bird&#39;s loud voice, whether it was singing or not, which 
she felt was enough to drive her crazy in the early of the morning. Woke 
up in the mood of killing any black bird ever existed, the blonde once 
again proceeded to take a bath. Once she had finished, still annoyed 
with the black bird, she saw Kirika had already woken up. Still wearing 
her pyjamas, the brunette cutely tried to feed the black bird with fresh 
fish.

Giggled, the blonde said, &quot;If he can eat worn, it doesn&#39;t mean that he 
can eat any animals, Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Hmm..&quot; Kirika replied, as her eyes attention still to the black bird. 
&quot;I think so, too.. But he just way too cute when I saw him gazing at the 
fridge.&quot;

&quot;Huh? What do you mean?&quot; Mireille asked, perplexed.

&quot;I just try to feed him with whatever is in the refrigerator,&quot; she 
stopped for a moment, kept her eyes focus to the bird in front of her, 
&quot;and you coincidentally saw me while feeding him with this fish..&quot; 
Kirika then smile cheerfully, she looked like a kid when they first 
found an interesting toy to play with.

Precisely this time, Mireille had come to realize that most food in the 
refrigerator was put outside by Kirika alone. Eggs, milk, cheese, soda, 
vegetable, fruits were all messed up on the table. Despite how useless 
and weird the things would be, Kirika even put out fishes and meat. Not 
knowing whether to laugh or to be angry to the brunette, Mireille 
remained mute for a second. Live with such innocent being somehow could 
drive you crazy.

&quot;Well..,okay.. Do what you want to.., but remember to clean up the mess, 
Kirika.&quot; Mireile said, after sighed weakly.

Too busy to bother or answer, this time the Japanese girl tried to feed 
the bird with a bottle of mayonnaise that the blonde failed to notice. 
The black bird though, seemed like enjoying the attention he got, 
regardless of every horrible food he was forced to consume.

Mireille threw herself in her laptop&#39;s chair. She turned on the laptop, 
and started browsing. When they had no job to work for, the blonde would 
keep searching for some information regarding Soldats, whether it will 
come from her reliable friends, or from internet. Noir, however, need to 
be cautious of all danger they would coincidentally or purposely 
encountered.

&quot;Let&#39;s see..&quot; the blonde whisper to herself while searching, clicking on 
one of her usual source.

&quot;Mireille..&quot; a small voice suddenly called the blonde&#39;s name.

As no one else was in the room, the blonde could know who it was that 
speak, without bothered to glance or look. &quot;What is it?&quot;

Kirika hesitated for a second then said, &quot;What is in Kuro mind, you 
think..?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; This time the blonde stopped her activity and turned her back to 
see the person whom she was talking to. She saw that Kirika had stopped 
feeding the bird, and now staring at it. &quot;Kuro She gave that bird a name 
already?&quot;

&quot;Hmm.. Why do you want to know what the heck is that bird thinking?&quot;

Kirika whispered, &quot;He looks like bored to me, and I don&#39;t know why.&quot;

After saying that, the one with oriental blood sat herself at the polo 
table, while the black bird was acting restlessly in her palm.

&quot;If that bird really is bored, why does he keep moving like that..? What 
a weird bird..&quot;

&quot;Really..?&quot; Mireille finally asked, while closing her distance with the 
bird and Kirika. After a few step, she had sat beside the brunette.

&quot;What should we do?&quot; Kirika asked in a worried tone.

A bit ignorant, Mireille said what came first into her mind. &quot;Maybe he 
wanted to be free?&quot;

To Mireille surprised, Kirika seemed to really considering the blonde&#39;s 
opinion, and replied nothing for the next minutes. It seemed like what 
had the blonde said was undoubtedly annoyed the Japanese girl&#39;s mind. 
Now that she was aware of it, the blonde noticed that her partner&#39;s 
expression had changed a little to an unpredictable melancholy state. 
Suddenly came to realize that Kirika did not want the bird to go away 
yet, the blonde really felt uncomfortable and guilty for saying what she 
had said. She blamed herself to be that ignorant towards Kirika&#39;s 
feeling. Just right when the blonde wanted to say some apologizing 
word...

&quot;... you&#39;re right.&quot; Kirika had finally said something after a long 
silence between them.

&quot;Er... Maybe it isn&#39;t correct, Kirika.. It&#39;s just my..&quot;

As Mireille was trying to convince Kirika, the Japanese walked to open 
the window. Too late.

&quot;Now you are free, little bird.&quot; The Japanese girl whispered softly to 
the bird, as if it can hear her. &quot;Bye, Kuro.&quot; Kirika bid the bird a sad 
and unwilling farewell.

Somehow, the black bird managed to fly outside normally as if he had 
never injured at the first place.

&quot;...&quot; Mireile was speechless.

Suddenly there was a beep sound from the laptop. It was a sound to sign 
that somebody had received a new message. The blonde rushed toward her 
notebook, and read the new message in silence. For a minute, she forgot 
about the bird&#39;s matter.

&quot;..I see.&quot; Mireile said to herself.

&quot;Anything new?&quot; Kirika asked. She seemed to be fully recovered from her 
disgrace feeling that was caused by Kuro&#39;s departure. Now she had 
remained back to her usual, expressionless self.

&quot;A friend of mine said that we are ought to be cautious of anything 
suspicious.&quot; answered Mireille. &quot;In other way..,&quot; she looked at Kirika 
seriously, &quot;Soldats have already begun their move.&quot;

Many days had passed since the day Mireille received the email. To tell 
the truth, there was nothing happened. No gunshots, no murder event, and 
no such thing as danger. Kirika stared at the sky and Mireille was 
watching the comedy show at TV. It really was peaceful. It was as if 
they weren&#39;t assassins but travelers or tourists.

Felt a little bored, Mireille asked, &quot;Kirika, want to go out a bit?&quot;

The Japanese girl faced her comrade then replied, &quot;Okay.&quot;

On another sunny day, the two of them walked to the shop center not too 
far from the apartment. It had become a habit that Mireille brought home 
at least three bags when she went out for some shopping. But 
fortunately, this was a trip made out of boredom, so they just wandered 
around the shopping center. They stopped for looking at the shop&#39;s 
display for a few times. As they enjoyed each other company, and the 
peaceful time they had, time flew by naturally.

&quot;Can we look at that shop?&quot; suddenly Kirika asked. Her finger was 
pointed at a shop at the end of the road.

The shop was none other than a pet shop. Never forget what was done by 
Kirika the other day before, Mireille nodded in agreement, and 
eventually they entered the shop.

Once they entered, all can be seen were lots of animals in cages. The 
shop was empty of customer, despite all the animals being crowded. 
Mireille and Kirika,even anyone without heart could suddenly felt kind 
of sorry for all the animals in the shop to be caged, as the animals 
were all looked like sad and did not even have the spirit to live. 
Regardless of how uninviting and uninteresting the pet shop was, the two 
of them wandered around together and barely stopped to stare at some 
unique animals which catch their attention. Pretty new to acknowledge 
animals kind, they found themselves surprised and excited to see some 
weird and animals such as different kind of reptiles, and insects.

&quot;It sure is kind of... nasty.&quot; Mireille said. She pointed her finger at 
a green, huge snake trapped in a mirror box.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kirika nodded in agreement.

Mireille whose attention was occupied by a giant tarantulas, purposely 
failed to notice that Kirika was on her way to wander alone in the cat&#39;s 
zone.

So.., you want a cat, eh? Mireille thought. She pretended not to see 
that Kirika was excitedly looking around.

From Mireille&#39;s secret point of view, she could see Kirika smiling to a 
white fluffy ball. After a while waiting, the blonde decided to approach 
the brunette who still staring at the fluffy cat.

&quot;Well.. Do you want one?&quot; the blonde asked as soon as she was beside the 
Japanese girl.

&quot;Er.. It&#39;s kinda cute, actually..&quot; Kirika said while smiling friendly to 
the cat.

&quot;Yeah, it sure is..&quot;

&quot;Is it really okay to have one?&quot; Kirika asked in a serious tone, her 
brown orbs gazed at Mireille&#39;s eyes.

Anyone would think that Kirika really didn&#39;t know how to express 
herself, but being together for almost forever since a long time ago, 
Mireille had come to realize and know of all the Japanes girl&#39;s 
expression. This time, Mireille knew that Kirika deliberately asked with 
her heart.

Mireille laughed a bit, then said, &quot;Yes. You can pick one, either that 
fluffy ball or others.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll pick this one. The one you called fluffy.&quot; Kirika said 
cheerfully, smiling.

They bought the white cat, which unsurprisingly remain silent all the 
way. Not even a &quot;meooww&quot; came out from that fat whity things. The shop 
assistant was somehow excited to have a customer as he became very 
friendly and laughing uncontrollably when Kirika and Mireille told that 
they wanted to buy an animal. The shop assistant, be fascinated as he 
would be, had managed to give Kirika a free cage for the fluffy cat. 
After paying and thanking the cheerful shop assistant, they walked out 
from the shop. It was already night, to their surprise. Both Kirika and 
Mireille did not realize how much time had been spent in the shop. Most 
people had gone home already at this time.

Walking together down the pavement, chill cold wind joined and filled 
the space between Mireille and Kirika. One could assume that tonight was 
beautiful, as the moon shone brightly, making each person shade to 
follow exactly its owner. The streets lamp was shining bright, led all 
people stuck down the road crossed over the silence night.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Kirika said after they were walked out in silence, slowly 
approaching the apartment. The Japanese girl fixed her gaze at 
Mireille&#39;s eyes, then give her simple, charming smile.

Mireille could not help but felt a little embarrassed. Yet the blonde 
did not realize that her cheek had become a bit redder than usual. &quot;I.. 
It&#39;s okay. You barely got a present, anyway.&quot; she said, suddenly felt 
like hiding her own face to Kirika.

It&#39;s just a cat, isn&#39;t it..?

Mireille was full in her thought, and all the sudden she realized that 
Kirika had suddenly stopped walking. The brunette did not say anything 
as she just stood still in her place, one hand carrying the cat in its 
cage. The blonde, confused and curious, joined the act of analyzing 
surrounding. She got the feeling that someone was watching them not too 
far away.

As Mireille&#39;s eyes quickly snooping around, her thought concluded that 
there was only one way out from this shopping area to their apartment. 
There was no other way or option. They had to walk this way, that for 
sure. It was also a fact that now, there were only the two of them on 
the street.

Realizing the air feeling tensed, Kirika and Mireille pulled out their 
gun. They kept still, back to back, close to each other. Yet nothing 
happened for the next minutes.

Gun hold tight in their hand while mouth shut and let out no words came 
out, the two of them suddenly heard a scream not too far from where they 
were standing at. It was a girl&#39;s voice. Both Mireille and Kirika were 
already in their own position to fight. Carefully and quickly, they 
sneaked and approached the pathway on their right, the source of the 
scream.

As they got closer, it became darker. There was not a single lamp at 
this path. Trusting their own eyes, Mireille and Kirika kept moved 
forward, and found something was on the ground.

The two of them had completely understood and familiar with what they 
found, without looking. A group of man dressed in a same black uniform 
was killed and unconsciously laying on the ground on the pathway. It 
seemed they were all stabbed with some sharp things. They walked closer 
and closer and finally stopped behind a thick wall. Conversation was 
barely heard, but Mireille was sure there was someone talking right 
behind the wall.

She glanced at Kirika, and realized that they were surrounded by a group 
of man with same uniform they last saw. All of them were pointed their 
gun to them silently. Fortunately all of them hadn&#39;t shot yet. Kirika 
didn&#39;t move even a step. She remained calm and expressionless, while her 
gun was pointed nowhere but rest beside her waist.

Kirika

Mireille saw Kirika made a little move. At the same time, both Mireille 
and Kirika released the bullets in their gun towards the man. Just as 
the group of man fell one by one, Mireille and Kirika saw some knifes 
were launched at the other man left. And a second after, all the man 
fell down. Didn&#39;t know whether to feel relief or not, Mireille just 
stood still in her position while holding her gun, waiting for the 
unpredictable person to meet them. She was ready for anything to greet 
her.

While Mireille was still in her fighting pose, Kirika remained calm as 
usual and walked over to check the victims. She pulled off a knife that 
stabbed the body of almost all man. Mireille in her ready, watched 
Kirika did all this. The Japanese girl silently stared at the knife. 
After a few second, she stood up while holding the knife tightly. The 
sound of a chill wind kind of broke the silence. Kirika whispered a word 
which definitely ran chill down on Mireille&#39;s spine.
