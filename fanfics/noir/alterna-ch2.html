<h1>Alterna-Noir (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a>

<a href="../noir/alterna-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Kirika, I&#39;m going on an assignment!&quot; Mireille called out as she got 
ready to leave. &quot;Don&#39;t feel like you have to tag along.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Kirika said. &quot;The World just came in and I&#39;m trying it out.&quot;

&quot;Let me see that.&quot; Mireille walked over to Kirika&#39;s laptop, where the 
game was being installed, and picked up the box. On the front was a 
blue haired boy with orange medieval looking clothes holding two 
daggers. Above the boy, in large cut-from-granite font was &#39;The 
World&#39;. &quot;So, this is what the big fuss was about. So this is a game?&quot;

&quot;An online game. I&#39;m gonna be a Twin Blade called Princess Myshkin.&quot;

&quot;O-kay, whatever you say. I&#39;m just gonna do my hit now.&quot; Mireille left 
before Kirika could regale her with more character specs.

**********************************************************************

Mireille waited impatiently by the mailbox, ready to fall asleep. 
*When is he gonna get here? God this is boring. At least when I&#39;m 
killing I&#39;m not bored to snores. But no, he has me standing guard over 
a bunch of *drugs*. I really should just go home. This almost isn&#39;t 
worth it*

Before Mireille could completely nod off, however, a shard of glass 
whizzed right past her, cutting her cheek. &quot;Ow! How dare you...
Phillipe? Is that you?&quot; She stared wide-eyed at the man standing 
before her.

&quot;Hello, sister. You let that little brat kill me. Prepare to die.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Phillipe--&quot; Mireille was cut off by another shard of glass 
whizzing past her.

&quot;You were&#39;t there! You didn&#39;t stop her. Now you&#39;ll die!&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute! I was eight!&quot; Another shard flew past. &quot;And how can 
you control glass?!&quot;

&quot;Because I can. You better run, sister!&quot; Phillipe telekinetically 
picked up more glass from the street and aimed it at Mireille.

&quot;Oh Christ!&quot; Mireille ran down the sidewalk, away from Phillipe, and 
across the parking lot, with Phillepe laughing maniacally and throwing 
glass the whole time. She retreated into the nearest grocery store.

She sighed and leaned against the enterance, grateful that her brother 
hadn&#39;t followed. *What&#39;s up with him? He&#39;s dead but he&#39;s alive, he 
blames me for &#39;letting&#39; Kirika kill him, and worst of all, he&#39;s 
telekinetic! This is crazy!* Suddenly she motices a heavy, thumping 
rhythm blaring over the speakers, outdone only by extremely vulgar 
rapping. &quot;Ah, Eminem.&quot; For all her high-class fronting, in truth 
Eminem was her guilty pleasure, one Kirika didn&#39;t understand why she 
had to hide. She was shaken out of her reverie by a high, Southern 
drawl. &quot;Mireille?&quot;

Mireille gasped and asked, &quot;Maggie? What&#39;re you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I work here, silly. What&#39;re you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Hiding from my brother.&quot;

&quot;Wha? But he&#39;s dead!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s complicated.&quot;

Just then a young stocky man walked their way. &quot;Mireille, what&#39;re you 
doing here? Taking another hit?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s hiding from her brother, Cris.&quot;

&quot;Oh, him?&quot; He pointed to the tall blonde throwing around glass, 
apparently oblivious to the fact his sister was inside. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;But what&#39;re you doing here in the first place? I mean no crime lords 
live here, and I haven&#39;t heard of any hits recently.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Mireille started to sweat.

&quot;Come on, you can tell us.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re carting drugs, is it?&quot;

&quot;Um, that. Yeah.&quot;

They both looked at Mireille wide-eyed. &quot;Whoa, you,. deal drugs? 
That&#39;s so...beneath you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know, but the fee was hefty.&quot;

&quot;Not hefty enough for *that*&quot; Cris looked outside.

&quot;Well at least you&#39;re not using. Or are you?&quot;

&quot;Gods no. The last thing I need is to corner my target and have a bad 
trip.&quot;
 
&quot;So, what to do about him?&quot; Cris asked.

&quot;Throw water on him!&quot; Maggie shouted.

&quot;What?&quot; Mireille asked. &quot;He&#39;s not made of sugar!&quot;

&quot;I know what,&quot; a gossipy old lady who had crept up behind them said. 
&quot;We&#39;ll distract him, and Miri&#39;ll shoot him. Whaddya say?&quot;

&quot;But he throws glass, Ines! Telekinetically!&quot; All three shouted to her.

&quot;Jeez, you don&#39;t have to shout,&quot; she winced. &quot;Fine, we&#39;ll throw stuff 
on him.&quot;

&quot;I still vote for the water!&quot; Maggie said.

&quot;I have a plan. Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do.&quot; Mireille huddled with her 
aqauintances and told them her plan.

********************************************************************** 

&quot;Ready?&quot; Cris said. &quot;Now!&quot; He and Ines ran out to the parking lot wiht 
makeshirt shielda, made from the scales on the registers. Phillipe 
again focused on a target. While he as distracted Maggie ran a stock 
cart against him and crushed him between it and the buggy corral. 
&quot;Mireille!&quot; she shouted.

Mireille ran out while he was stunned and emptied her clip into him. 
Her brother lifted his head and smiled madly at her, and sparks came 
out of the bullet holes. She recoiled in horror. &quot;Sweet Jesus, you&#39;re 
a robot!&quot;

&quot;Die, sister,&quot; he said.

&quot;I told you to throw the water!&quot; Maggie shouted.

&quot;Forget the water!&quot; Cris shouted back. &quot;Get the generator!&quot;

&quot;I have a better idea!&quot; Mireille shouted. &quot;Hold him!&quot; All three 
acquaintances held the cart against Phillipe, even as he started 
crumpling it with his mind. Mireille hijacked the nearest car and 
honked at the three to move, and then rammed her brother with it, 
again and again and again, until he was nothing more a pile of scrap 
metal and wires. 

Mireille got out of the car, exhausted. &quot;That was my brother I just 
killed.&quot;

&quot;No it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Maggie said, &quot;It was just a hunk of junk.&quot;

&quot;But it looked and souned just like him...well, what he woul&#39;ve looked 
and sounded like if he&#39;d lived. Someone sent him after me.&quot; *I&#39;ll just 
bet it was the Soldats.*

&quot;Well, if we hear anything we&#39;ll let you know. We gotta get back to 
work. Our boss&#39;ll kill us if he notices we&#39;re gone,&quot; Cris said.

&quot;Literally,&quot; Ines added.

&quot;Bye,&quot; Mireille said as she walked back to the mailbox.

**********************************************************************

&quot;Where the devil have you been? I was about to fall asleep!&quot; Mireille 
assaulted her client--a young man wearing a cheesy green lounge suit 
with an equally cheesy green hat and sunglasses--after he stepped out 
of the rusty green car.

&quot;I had some guys to shake off. So where&#39;s the product?&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s my money?&quot;

&quot;Right here, shugah.&quot; He handed her a few hundreds. &quot;My product?&quot;

Mireille&#39;s vein twitched at the word &#39;shugah&#39; as she broke into the 
mailbox and retrieved the package. &quot;So what&#39;s in this thing? Crack? 
Heroin? PCP?&quot;

&quot;Laundry detergent.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Laundry detergent&#39;?&quot; Mireille asked weakly,&quot;Tell me you&#39;re kidding.&quot; 
She tore open the package and sniffed the white powder. &quot;Yoi&#39;re not 
kidding.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s for my mudda.&quot;

&quot;Your &#39;mudda?&#39; I&#39;ll show you mudda.&quot; She held her gun to him. &quot;Give me 
all your money and I might let you live.&quot;

&quot;Y-you can&#39;t do this to me!&quot;

&quot;Oh yes I can. Now do it. The last guy who refused paid dearly.&quot; She 
cracked her knuckles to prove her point.

&quot;Okay okay!&quot; He held his hands up, shaking like a little girl.

Mireille stripped him down to his boxers and stole all of his money, 
then walked away. She came back and gave him a swift kick in the 
groin. &quot;That&#39;s for hying to me.&quot; SHe stole his watch, too, then walked 
away again. 

**********************************************************************

Author&#39;s notes: The World--which will be a running theme in this 
story--belongs to Bee Train, Bandai, and I think Xebec. But I *know* 
it belongs to Bee Train, at the very least. And the boy on the box is 
Kite. And Kirika named herself after the cat. 

Also, I have no idea what Mireille&#39;s brother&#39;s name is, and I think 
Sprite said on oyasumi,nu that his name was Phillipe, so I&#39;m going 
with that.

And finally, yes Eminem is a real artist.
