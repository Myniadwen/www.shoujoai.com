<a href="../noir/washdish-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Want a snack, or is your stomach still queasy from the rides?&quot; she 
asks, dropping her purse onto the pool table.

&quot;Just tea.&quot; I&#39;m not hungry, not now.

She makes a clucking sound, then motions for me to sit at the table. 
&quot;I&#39;ll make the tea, since you don&#39;t feel well.&quot;

I sit down, but have so much energy I can&#39;t hold still. It bothers me 
that she acts as if nothing happened. I get up and go into the kitchen, 
and see that she has an apple, a pear and a block of cheese on the 
counter. I go up behind her and slide my arms around her. She pulls open 
the drawer next to us, and pulls out a knife.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; I start, but falter. What can I say to her, and should I 
say anything at all?

&quot;So who was it?&quot; her voice cuts into my thoughts. &quot;You never told me.&quot;

My body gets a chill. I don&#39;t want to talk about Chloe. I want to forget 
the manor, forget the look on Chloe&#39;s face, forget what I have done.

&quot;Mireille...I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;It was her, wasn&#39;t it? Wasn&#39;t it?&quot; her tone is as sharp as the knife 
she&#39;s using on the cheese. Without warning she jerks her hand out to the 
wall, grabs the cutting board and slams it down on the counter, making 
me jump. I swallow hard, but she says nothing else, and begins to cut 
the fruit.

&quot;So what else did you two do?&quot; the knife keeps cutting with slow, 
deliberate precision. &quot;Hmmm?&quot; she scoops the apples onto a plate. &quot;You 
must have done something to pass the time there.&quot; Her voice is measured 
and even, but I can feel the tension in her body. I let go of her and 
step back. The teapot whistles, and she reaches over and snaps off the 
burner. She holds onto the counter and sighs.

&quot;Every time I think there&#39;s nothing else you can do to hurt me...&quot; she 
whispers, her voice choking. My eyes widen and I step back further. The 
pain in her voice, so much like the pain in Chloe&#39;s voice....I cannot be 
here. I cannot take this pain, I cannot take causing any more pain.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mireille. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; I choke out, and stumble out of the 
kitchen.

----------

I run out the door, and take the steps down two at a time. I feel the 
stuffed animals flying out of my pockets but I don&#39;t care. I burst 
through the door into the cool night, seeking some sort of relief. The 
cold air is like a slap to my face, and I lean against the wall, 
panting. I have to do something. I have to...suddenly I remember a piece 
of paper wadded into my pocket. I run down the block to the pay phone 
and dial the number. After a few rings, my prayers are answered.

&quot;Uncle? It&#39;s Kirika.&quot; I try and catch my breath. &quot;Can I talk to you?&quot;

----------

The apartment is dark as I quietly open the door. It&#39;s after one in the 
morning. Uncle gave me money for a taxi home, after we had finished 
talking. I gave him the last stuffed animal I had left, and he seemed 
very pleased. I feel much better now too, although part of me is afraid. 
Afraid of what will happen next, but knowing I can&#39;t go back now.

I make my way to our bed, but it&#39;s empty. A sudden fear the Mireille may 
have left engulfs me, and I quickly run back out into the rest of the 
apartment, looking for her. I pass by an empty wine bottle on the table, 
but no Mireille. Finally I see her kneeling on the veranda outside, her 
head bent down. Her nightshirt waffles slightly in the wind, but she 
remains motionless as I go stand next to her.

I look down and see her gun in her right hand, with the silencer in 
place. Her other hand holds a small white object that after a moment, I 
realize is the baby seal I gave her from the carnival. Seeing her 
holding it makes me feel like crying, for some silly reason.

&quot;You came back.&quot; her voice is flat and dull, as if she&#39;s lost all 
emotion. She lays her gun down and pushes it towards me. &quot;You do it 
then.&quot;

&quot;Mireille?&quot;

&quot;You do it. Noir, you do it. Send me back with my parents.&quot; her voice is 
so low, I can barely hear her. &quot;You should be the one to do it.&quot;

I feel myself shaking, as if I&#39;ve never been colder in my life.

&quot;No.&quot; it barely comes out, I&#39;m shaking so much.

&quot;Why not? You took everything else. What&#39;s one more life.&quot; she pushes 
the gun so that it touches my foot. &quot;Finish it.&quot;

I put my foot over the gun, dragging it away from us both. I&#39;m shaking 
so hard that the gun wobbles, grating over the concrete.

&quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t ...Mireille, I love you.&quot; my voice is thin and 
shaking, but I&#39;ve said it. I hear her sob and her head goes lower, then 
her fist hits the ground.

&quot;No.&quot; her weak voice almost blends in with the wind. &quot;Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t, 
Kirika...&quot;

I squat down next to her, wanting to touch her, but afraid. I put my 
mouth close to her ear.

&quot;I love you Mireille. I do.&quot; I let the wind take my words to her.

She crawls back on all fours and presses into the corner grate of the 
veranda, crying. I want to hold her, but something tells me not to touch 
her when she&#39;s cornered like this. I stand back up and go back into the 
apartment.

I get dressed for bed, silent tears rolling down my face. She&#39;s right. 
I&#39;ve taken everything. I took her family, and because of me, she took 
her uncle&#39;s life. I lay back on the bed, flat on my back, and look up at 
the ceiling, thinking.

&quot;Take care of her.&quot; I can see her mother&#39;s face, hear her voice once 
again in the darkness.

&quot;I want to...I really want to.&quot; I whisper back. &quot;More than anything. But 
how?&quot;</pre>
