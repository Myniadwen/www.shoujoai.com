A Remnant of a Pilgrimage


It was the dead of night with the hour well past twelve, it having 
become deeply immersed in time&#39;s darkest, most sinister stretch during 
Mireille and Kirika&#39;s hunt across the city for the false Noir. A 
moonless sky enclosed the assassins in a black dome above, the few 
visible weakly twinkling stars hanging overhead ineffectually trying to 
shine through a thick spattering of murky charcoal cloud cover that 
seemingly absorbed their light with ease; the dark scoring dominance 
over its counterpart, a result so reminiscent of real life. On the 
street below the one-sided struggle where Mireille and Kirika stood 
unbroken quiet reigned; there were no faint whooshes of the occasional 
car travelling down a distant road, no muted calls of late-night 
revellers leaving dance clubs finally closing their doors, nor was there 
even the repeated chirps of nocturnal insects to break the hush. It was 
just the quiet--the silence--as if there wasn&#39;t another soul alive in 
the world bar the two young women, the dead of night living up to its 
name.

The already low temperature had dropped too as the hour had progressed, 
the air degenerating from a mere unpleasant chilly that cooled the skin 
to a biting icy that threatened to numb it. Frozen hands akin to those 
of a corpse stroked swirling patterns across Mireille&#39;s bare midriff, 
teasing goose bumps into puckering as they passed. The muscles of her 
stomach stiffened at the touch of the freezing winds turned caresses, 
but she didn&#39;t let them bother her, not even making the slightest move 
to close her gently flapping coat around her body to attain extra 
warmth. It was cold like the inside of a meat locker, cold like a 
morgue... but it was just another distraction to Mireille that she 
easily ignored, and a minor distraction at that. In truth she thought 
the grim atmosphere and the frosty temperature along with it rather 
appropriate considering what had taken place thus far this night, and 
considering what was about to. All that was missing were the wisps of 
roiling fog hovering over the road in front of her and Kirika before a 
classic gritty backdrop of a film noir would come to life.

Mireille smiled, a smile as cold as her surroundings. A film noir. How 
appropriate indeed. The black skies, the quiet, still ambiance, the 
freezing air--they were the perfect conditions, the perfect setting for 
one of those types of movies. And Mireille and Kirika were the perfect 
if somewhat atypical protagonists, both poised for what looked to be the 
climatic scene where they met their nemeses at last for the final, 
decisive confrontation that spelled certain doom for one side. They were 
the lone executioners out for themselves, symbolising Death 
itself--Death in two halves--coming, coming to claim their detested 
adversaries in a hail of bullets. And now after stalking the gloomy 
nighttime streets in dogged pursuit of their prey, cardboard cutout bad 
guys dead by the dozen behind them, they had arrived at their final 
destination for the supposed ultimate showdown. At the end of the trail. 
At the end of their involvement with Soldats. Tomorrow this... 
divergence... from Mireille and Kirika&#39;s prior lifestyle would be merely 
an unpleasant memory, one to be forgotten, disregarded as if it had 
never happened. It would be a happy ending for them, a moderately rare 
thing in a film noir. Still, those endings did sometimes occur where the 
antiheros somehow despite their dark existences found peace and 
contentment, much like when Mireille and Kirika had found it following 
the shootout at the Manor. Those protagonists, however, customarily paid 
for their joy in the blood of others, but seldom was that blood 
innocent, just like in this instance. For freedom from the machinations 
of Soldats, for a life of relative solitude with her partner, Kirika, 
Mireille saw the deaths of two more murderers on top of countless others 
already slain by their hands as a cheap price she was gladly willing to 
pay. Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu would be dead by dawn; she swore 
it. The vendetta she had against them for being partly responsible for 
dragging her and Kirika back onto the black path would be satisfied in 
the only way it could be--with violence and bloodshed resulting in 
death. Their deaths.

The deserted street where Mireille and Kirika were situated in was dimly 
lit by old, black cast-iron lampposts lining either side of the road, 
their circles of light spread out a foot or two apart from each other 
with shadows filling in the gaps. It was there in those shadows that the 
pair of assassins lurked, scrutinising the building on the opposite side 
of the street with calculating eyes.

The contact Mireille had phoned whilst departing Simon&#39;s decrepit abode 
hadn&#39;t appreciated the very early wake-up call or being dragged out of 
bed, but nevertheless had dug up the address for &#39;Albert Laroque&#39; within 
twenty minutes... although the time could have been shortened if she&#39;d 
forgone grumbling about the hour during the first five minutes of their 
conversation. From the slums to the suburbs Mireille and Kirika had then 
journeyed, the acquired address pointing to a residence in an 
upper-class and quite exclusive district of Paris, a welcome change from 
the capitol&#39;s less than savoury locales. Yet while the potential threat 
from the common hoodlum was greatly reduced in such an environment, 
there were other dangers to watch out for. In Mireille&#39;s experience the 
exceptionally rich regularly saw themselves as a superior breed than 
others, haughtily believing that they were above the perceived &#39;lower 
caste&#39; of people and the laws that governed them. Hence, they sometimes 
liked to make their own rules--if any--with their hired security guards 
who safeguarded their assets and persons--who tended to be little more 
than semi-straight gangsters with dubious morals oft cases--partial to 
shooting first and asking questions later, secure in the knowledge that 
their wealthy and typically influential employer would deflect the 
ensuing flak from the authorities a lead-filled body would bring. 
Justice blinded for a Euro or two. Mireille wasn&#39;t criticising the last 
fact, however--far from it. She herself had paid off more than one law 
enforcement official to look the other way in her lifetime, and would do 
it again without a second thought if called for. Like those affluent 
members of high society with superiority complexes, she was rather 
thankful that the law was only as strong as the people who upheld it. 
But the difference was Mireille never forgot that she wasn&#39;t above it. 
Regardless of what one believed of the law, at the end of the day it 
would still judge your actions all the same... if you were caught, that 
is.

However, by the looks of the mansion Mireille and Kirika were currently 
scoping out there were no aforementioned sentries to contend with. True, 
it was one of the largest houses--or rather, estates--in the district, 
but not a guard was in sight. The Corsican expected the nightshift to be 
smaller than the dayshift, but she at least thought a doorman of sorts 
would be by the front gate entrance even at this late hour. She had her 
suspicions as to why this was of course, ranging from the absent guard 
simply answering a call of nature to him or her having been brutally 
slain--the top choice for the moment, taking into account that Ryosuke 
and Vincent apparently had an interest in this particular property--yet 
none she wished to accept as concrete without further investigation. For 
all she knew the guard watched over his post from a distance, maybe even 
from an elevated position with a high-powered rifle. *That* would be a 
nasty surprise. One could never be too cautious in this business; your 
life was on the line, after all; your most precious possession.

Well, in *theory* your most precious possession, Mireille amended with a 
sardonic smirk as her eyes darted surreptitiously to her diminutive 
colleague beside her. The blonde naturally held her own life in high 
regard, but if she had to choose between it and Kirika&#39;s, the subject 
became... hazy. Sure, Mireille wanted to live for as long as 
possible--who didn&#39;t?--but if it came at the cost of her partner&#39;s 
continued existence....

Mireille closed her eyes for a second, and when she opened them again 
they had returned to the mansion. Her growing sentimentality was going 
to get her killed someday, her brush with death or at least severe 
bodily harm at the Metro station a few days ago a forewarning of the 
potential catastrophe awaiting her. She was grimly aware that there was 
barely if any room for it in the life of a killer... not that she had 
the slightest inclination to curb it at all in spite of that 
understanding. Love. Mireille wondered if it were really a blessing and 
not a curse instead. But whatever it was, she knew she couldn&#39;t be 
without it, or specifically not without Kirika&#39;s love. The woman&#39;s heart 
had a taste for it now; it was used to its warmth. For it to be cast 
back into the cold... Mireille doubted whether it would survive the 
shock intact.

Mireille marshalled her straying mind&#39;s faculties back to her pressing 
task, focusing her attention on the place she and her partner would 
likely be infiltrating in a few minutes. Looking at the building and its 
surrounding land, she was sure she and Kirika had the right Albert 
Laroque. When in doubt, always follow the money and the bigwig who had 
it. Usually they had links--be they direct or indirect--to some 
nefarious activity or activities. Petty drug infractions, hardcore arms 
dealing--essentially anything that made them wealthier or provided 
illicit pleasure. Or both. In addition Mireille didn&#39;t believe 
individuals like Ryosuke and Vincent would have business with Albert 
Laroque the grocer who lived a boring life in a duplex with his wife and 
two children. It was common sense. Whatever the false Noir&#39;s reasons for 
visiting Laroque&#39;s estate, it had to be on the shady side, possibly with 
murderous ambition. The blonde couldn&#39;t fathom a mundane cause for them 
to do so, especially since they had gone so far as to kill Simon and 
everyone who had been with him at the time in his basement, all in an 
effort to cover their tracks. Ryosuke and Vincent were foreigners in an 
unfamiliar country; what other grounds could there be but on a business 
affair?

Laroque&#39;s estate was quite vast, spanning at least two hundred square 
metres. A three foot high light grey brick wall enclosed the compound, 
with a sturdy fence of jet black iron bars capped with wicked arrowheads 
protruding at least seven feet out of its top face, their motif not 
unlike the nearby lampposts&#39; in the street. A lawn of well kept, lush, 
dark green grass covered most of the estate&#39;s interior, with a handful 
of neatly arranged circular flowerbeds sprinkled here and there in a 
orderly fashion creating the illusion that the house it surrounded was a 
chateau in the countryside rather than a mansion in the city. Most of 
the flowering plants inside the beds had ceased to bloom however, the 
close onset of winter to blame for their now barren look. Nevertheless, 
the conifers present still thrived, the small ones on the edge of the 
flowerbeds and the tall ones bordering the outside of the estate&#39;s 
unfriendly fence as green as ever. Yet without the bright colours of 
flourishing blossoms the interior of the estate with its gardens 
appeared dull, dreary, all greys and greens and blacks. Of course it was 
nighttime, but Mireille suspected that even in the day light hours it 
would seem bleak, perhaps even bleaker.

A gravel road of slate-grey stone chips lit by flanking short bollard 
lamps extended out from the main gate and merged into a small roundabout 
in front of the mansion, another flowerbed--although larger--filling its 
centre. The two-storey house itself sat approximately in the heart of 
the grounds, constructed of the same hefty and aged bricks as the 
estate&#39;s wall. It was difficult for Mireille to make out fine details 
through the murk of the night, but she did note that the building was 
designed in the classic old-fashioned style reminiscent of many a rural 
land manor of yesteryear, its sole exceptions its windows which had been 
modernised--framed in white they were, and tall and slender, plus arched 
at their zenith--and the inclusion of a garage beside the right side of 
house, likely the abode of numerous luxury cars.

No lights shone from the expansive house; it was drenched utterly in 
darkness, for all intents and purposes asleep for the night. It was the 
ideal time for guests disinclined to announce themselves to visit, 
guests like Ryosuke and Vincent... and guests like Mireille and Kirika. 
The false Noir were probably flitting through the mansion&#39;s gloomy 
corridors like malevolent spectres at this very moment if the Corsican 
and her partner had gotten their facts right, but soon two more spirits 
would join them in their haunt, spirits who rattled no chains nor wailed 
their presence. While houses slumbered, the silent ghosts reigned 
supreme.

Plumes of mist fleetingly clouded the air in front of Mireille&#39;s face 
with her every breath--as soft as those breaths were--and the cold of 
the dead night was beginning to permeate to her very bones. She clenched 
and then unclenched her fists slowly, her ten fingers turned ten icicles 
aching as fresh hot blood was pumped into the numbed flesh. She and 
Kirika had tarried long enough in this winter&#39;s chill. Rubbing out their 
two distorted mirror images should serve to warm them up nicely.

Mireille turned away from the sight of Laroque&#39;s residence to Kirika, 
for one to inform her that they were to venture inside the estate&#39;s 
grounds momentarily, and for another because she was curious as to how 
her petite and lightly clad partner was coping with the cold so far. 
Kirika&#39;s arms and legs were completely bare owing to her sleeveless top 
and short skirt; an average girl of her slight build would be 
practically shivering and chattering her teeth by now. Yet, as Mireille 
had predicted from observing her on numerous other frosty nights, her 
diminutive but consummate partner in the business of dealing death 
didn&#39;t appear to be affected by the wintry weather at all. Kirika stood 
perfectly at ease on the pavement beside Mireille, her doe eyes glued to 
Laroque&#39;s estate as she carefully scrutinised the environment, totally 
unfazed by her bitter cold surroundings. Even her warm breath was 
virtually non-existent in the frosty air, hardly a wisp forming in spite 
of the considerable difference in temperature between the two.

Mireille wondered if Kirika intentionally suppressed her breathing as an 
act of stealth, or if it was an unconscious act that had been drilled 
into her during her less than cheerful childhood. Probably the latter; 
Kirika&#39;s entire childhood was sadly a tragic tale of abuse. Mireille&#39;s 
own childhood wasn&#39;t exactly a model for others to admire either, what 
with losing her parents and brother and having to abandon her home at a 
young age, but compared to her partner&#39;s it had been pure bliss. At 
least the blonde had had her uncle to look after and love her, but 
Kirika had had no one but Altena and her combat instructors who were 
doubtless not disposed to bestowing affection upon their charges.

Perhaps it was of no wonder then that the girl had fallen head over 
heels in love with Mireille. The woman was the only real person to ever 
show her even a shred of warmth, and considering that that warmth hadn&#39;t 
been that warm at all in the beginning was a testament to the extent of 
the maltreatment the young assassin had endured. Kirika herself had told 
Mireille in her farewell letter that she had been incredibly lonely 
until she had met her, that she had been relieved and excited when she 
had learned that Noir was a name for a pair of assassins. Indeed, it 
should be of no surprise that Kirika clung to the Corsican so fervently, 
and that she held her in such high esteem--Mireille&#39;s love was the first 
and only love Kirika had ever known. Such weighty responsibilities the 
girl put on the blonde&#39;s shoulders. Still, Mireille wouldn&#39;t have anyone 
else bear them. She cherished those responsibilities, and felt proud 
that she had been chosen to carry them... if a little nervous as well. 
Regardless, she would endeavour to be a first love worthy of Kirika, and 
one entitled to remain the only. Mireille would do her best to imbue the 
remainder of Kirika&#39;s life with the love that had been missing from her 
childhood, and in doing so perhaps make up for the past years of cruel 
mistreatment. Heaven knows the girl had earned it.

On a sudden and irresistible whim, either brought on by her prior 
introspective thoughts, simply to get Kirika&#39;s attention, or a 
combination of both, Mireille reached out and stroked the back of one 
finger down her partner&#39;s left upper arm, and learned that while the 
cold didn&#39;t seem to touch her mind, it did clearly touch her body. 
Kirika&#39;s skin was as chilled as Mireille&#39;s was, and a field of tiny 
goose bumps prickled the Corsican&#39;s finger as it proceeded towards the 
darkhaired girl&#39;s elbow.

Mireille smiled faintly at the ticklish sensation as her eyes followed 
her finger&#39;s gentle course. So Kirika was human after all. And the poor 
girl was as cold as she was, even if the stoic assassin didn&#39;t 
acknowledge it.

Kirika gave a start as soon as the woman made contact with her arm, and 
immediately turned her head to favour her with a quizzical look. 
Mireille merely continued to smile that fond smile however, undeterred 
by the expression and more importantly by the realisation of just what 
she was doing. Only a scant couple of days earlier she would have been 
quite uncomfortable touching Kirika in such a manner, no matter how 
innocuous a brush on the arm was. But while she still she had to 
restrain herself from pulling back her hand as if she was doing 
something improper, it was a fight easily won. Kirika needed the 
attention, needed the affection. She needed the love--Mireille&#39;s love. 
Yet Mireille couldn&#39;t help questioning her own motives. True, she wished 
to no longer neglect her other half and prove to the girl that she cared 
for her, but... but it wasn&#39;t only Kirika&#39;s desires she was satisfying.

Mireille was... attracted to Kirika. Goodness knows the lithe assassin 
was vastly skilled in the art of murder, far surpassing the Corsican&#39;s 
own ability, but she was also... well, put frankly, a very adorable 
girl. Mireille had tried not to acknowledge the fact, tried to distance 
herself from Kirika the person and simply view her partner as Kirika the 
assassin, but that was one battle she had slowly lost, and, in 
retrospect, had been bound to lose. She loved the girl with all her 
heart, and with that love came the longing to express it. Physically... 
intimately.

If Mireille looked at it rationally she knew it was a natural thing, a 
natural progression of a blossoming romantic relationship... but 
unfortunately when it involved Kirika the rational part of her mind 
rarely was given voice. It had taken Mireille a while to realise--or 
perhaps more correctly, decisively address--the genuine root of her... 
hesitation, the woman supposed one could call it, to touch Kirika 
affectionately, but it was all too clear to her now. It was funny how 
after all the arguably appalling things she had done as a killer for 
hire, taking the last remaining innocence of a teenage girl would give 
her pause. However, it wasn&#39;t as if Mireille was without morals or 
compassion. A killer she may be, but she was still a human being 
regardless of what anybody else thought. Kirika had been thrust into a 
life that few her age had been--or should be--subjected to, a life where 
innocence died a swift death. The things she had seen, the things she 
had done; all had stripped her of what it meant to be a child, stripped 
her almost bare of her innocence. Yet against all odds, a surprising 
amount of Kirika&#39;s naivety had survived the abuse, mostly attributable 
to her lack of schooling on everyday subjects and also undoubtedly to 
her self-preserving choice to repress the ghastly events of the past 
though the birthing of a second persona. Included in that subsisting 
naivety was her innocence regarding love, or rather the physical aspects 
of it. At least Kirika had that much of her innocence left, a fact that 
Mireille was exceedingly thankful for. In that regard she was untouched, 
pure and--the blonde was absolutely certain--virginal.

However, this posed as equal a joy as a predicament for Mireille. Part 
of the woman wanted to keep Kirika the way she was now forever--cute and 
clueless--but another simply *wanted* her. Mireille ached to touch 
Kirika, to hug her and kiss her as a lover would; it had been that 
yearning which had prompted her to caress the oblivious girl during her 
sleep, the only time she&#39;d had the courage to do so. Pathetic she knew, 
but she just couldn&#39;t help feeling that her desire was wrong. In the 
slightest touch she read a carnal craving lurking behind it, regardless 
of her true intent. Kirika was just so... so... so *innocent* in that 
respect; it was like she was taking advantage of her youthful partner. 
Mireille didn&#39;t think she even knew what a lesbian was!

Still, in spite of her reluctance to touch Kirika, Mireille was deeply 
aware it couldn&#39;t be avoided, regardless of what she wanted to do. 
Kirika needed her love, and she would have it. All of it. What that 
entailed exactly the Corsican didn&#39;t quite know yet, but the one thing 
she did know was not to push their relationship forwards with a heavy 
hand. Kirika was emotionally fragile in certain respects including this 
one--as most people were Mireille supposed--and she had to be treated 
like a fine china doll. Moreover, Mireille herself wasn&#39;t exactly keen 
to rush things either. Truth be told she was still finding her feet in 
all of this, the woman nearly as inexperienced as Kirika in the matters 
of the heart. Nevertheless, they would find their way. Together.

Mireille casually let her hand drop when her finger reached halfway down 
Kirika&#39;s arm, and then raised her eyes to make contact with her curious 
partner&#39;s. &quot;It&#39;s quiet,&quot; she said, casting her gaze back to the mansion 
for a moment and electing to not respond to the introverted girl&#39;s 
questioning countenance.

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika agreed, enticed into looking back at Laroque&#39;s house 
briefly by Mireille&#39;s like action and in turn apparently forgetting 
about Mireille&#39;s stroking finger, just as the crafty blonde had planned.

&quot;Then why don&#39;t we get out of this cold, hmm?&quot; Mireille suggested in a 
light voice, her smile broadening a little and becoming a shade 
encouraging.

&quot;Mm,&quot; Kirika mumbled again with a nod, although no smile brightened her 
face. Not that Mireille had expected one to appear. Killing people was 
nothing to smile about, not to Kirika at any rate. Maybe Mireille had 
overlooked a small piece of another innocence still alive in the girl. 
Sympathy for her victims was something that had died long ago inside the 
Corsican assassin--if it had ever been there at all--yet it seemed to 
still endure inside her kind-hearted partner. At one point in time 
Mireille had looked upon Kirika as something akin to a monster, but 
sometimes she wondered whom the real so-called &#39;monster&#39; was between 
them; the born and bred assassin with a warm heart, or the assassin born 
of circumstance with a cold one.

Without further ado Mireille and Kirika stepped off the footpath and 
crossed the brightly lit street, their heads warily turning both left 
and right as they checked to make sure it was empty, more to ensure that 
no one was around to espy their impending actions rather than to certify 
that the road was safe to traverse. They approached the estate&#39;s front 
gate--the sole entrance to the compound--as nonchalantly as possible, 
simply two people out for a late night--if freezing--stroll. Mireille 
felt edgy under the glare of the streetlights like an insect under a 
microscope, vulnerable and in the open, at the mercy of those beyond the 
lights. The shadows of the world were where she felt most comfortable, 
where she belonged.

Unluckily the road wasn&#39;t the only place that was illuminated; the 
estate&#39;s gate was situated in just the right spot to be flooded from all 
sides by the light from the streetlamps, and if that wasn&#39;t enough it 
even had its own lights shaped like box lanterns mounted on the front 
face of both pillars where the gate&#39;s hinges were affixed. Mireille so 
disliked operating out from under the cover of darkness, especially 
during nighttime assignments when a figure darting through pools of 
light in otherwise murk was all the more noticeable. However, while the 
abundance of light revealed the woman and her partner&#39;s presence to 
anybody who cared to look their way, it did also serve to reveal to the 
pair that something ahead was amiss.

Mireille and Kirika stopped in unison before the gate, blue and brown 
eyes drawn to the stone pillar on its right. Concealed amongst some 
thick foliage draping over the sides of a plant pot that was sitting 
atop the rectangular column was a twisted shaft of metal, the remains of 
a strut. And on the ground below it was the device it had been tasked 
with holding up--a small security camera, one designed for discrete 
surveillance. Except that this camera had been crushed into a lump of 
barely recognisable black plastic and grey steel, as if--judging by its 
ruined prop--it had been torn violently from its perch and then 
scrunched into a ball like nothing more than a piece of scrap paper, 
before being unceremoniously discarded to the ground.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika said softly, attracting the blonde&#39;s attention.

Mireille turned to Kirika and saw the girl gesture with a crooked finger 
at a row of tall conifers lining the fence on the right hand side of the 
front gate. At first the Corsican was puzzled at what was so interesting 
about a string of bushes, that was until she noticed the slumped figure 
lying obscured in the shadows behind their broad branches. She 
approached the still form, and after gingerly pulling back the springy 
plant life hiding it, saw that it was of a man dressed in a dark suit 
with a noticeable bulge where his full gun holster rested on his ribs; 
the uniform of an expensive hired guard. He lay on his side with his 
back against the wall enclosing the estate, and was clearly quite dead. 
With the conifers out of the way the light from the nearby streetlamps 
rushed to conquer the newly uncovered terrain, and consequently exposed 
the dreadful trauma the man&#39;s body had sustained, giving support to the 
aforementioned belief.

The guard&#39;s torso was covered in still wet blood that glistened dully in 
the light, the result of what Mireille believed to be numerous stab 
wounds if the slit-like rips in his shirt and suit jacket were anything 
to go by. However, there was also a very thin, dark red line across his 
throat from ear to ear coupled with some surrounding bruising, plus his 
tongue was lolling obscenely out of his mouth, like he had been 
strangled. Mireille was familiar with the latter injuries; it was the 
product of a swift and brutal garrotting with a fine instrument, 
probably a razor sharp wire of some sort possessing a high degree of 
tensile strength. Not the most pleasant fashion in which to leave this 
world.

The ultimate cause of the ill-fated sentry&#39;s demise was anybody&#39;s guess, 
however, even the murderers&#39;. The stabs seemed nasty and surely had 
struck several vital organs--by the looks of it, predominantly the heart 
and lungs, the prime targets to instil a definite death by knifing 
against one&#39;s victim--and the blood loss was tremendous, but the 
garrotting appeared to have cut deep and perhaps had severed the man&#39;s 
windpipe on top of strangling him. Death had come for this man along 
four different routes, but all equally as deadly; he had never even 
stood a hair&#39;s breadth of a chance. Ryosuke and Vincent certainly were 
efficient--if vicious--killers. But then in this business there was 
little distinction separating the two.

&quot;I guess this means we have the right address,&quot; Mireille commented dryly 
as she allowed the conifers to snap back into place, before turning back 
to Kirika. By the damp appearance of the blood the blonde could tell 
that the guard&#39;s wounds hadn&#39;t been dished out too long ago. It 
confirmed that their targets were still in the area, or to be more 
precise, in Laroque&#39;s manor. Fortunately Mireille and Kirika had not 
arrived here too late.

&quot;Mm...&quot; Kirika murmured, her eyes flicking to the mansion for a moment 
before returning to the Corsican.

Mireille&#39;s gaze found the mangled wreck of the surveillance camera once 
again, a light frown on her brow. It was strange that no one had come to 
investigate the sudden and ferocious destruction of the camera, nor the 
disappearance of the estate&#39;s forefront guard. There had to be a manned 
security station somewhere on the grounds or in the mansion itself if 
there was a camera; it would be rather pointless if nobody was watching 
the monitor it was linked up to otherwise. And as for the guard, while 
Ryosuke and Vincent may have dispatched him in a silent manner to not 
immediately alert his comrades in the vicinity, one of the other 
sentries must have eventually noticed that he was missing from his post 
for a worrying length of time.

Whatever the reason for the apparent lack of response, it was evident 
that security for Laroque&#39;s estate was fairly tight--lax response times 
notwithstanding--but really no greater than one could envisage for your 
average affluent and mistrustful family&#39;s posh home. A team of armed 
guards and a network of cameras were nothing Mireille hadn&#39;t encountered 
before, nor easily overcome without breaking a sweat. Guards could be 
avoided, misled with distraction, bribed, sweet-talked, knocked quietly 
unconscious, or just killed outright; and as for cameras their fields of 
view could simply be evaded until the individuals staffing the 
contraptions&#39; other ends were taken care of. A security camera without 
human eyes behind its electronic one was merely an empty threat, a 
maimed tool. Nevertheless, that electronic eye did tend to have an 
infallible memory as a cohort, but of course that was switched off or 
forcibly purged if necessary after the cameras&#39; operators had been 
similarly contended with, although perhaps in a more permanent fashion 
than the machines.

Mireille had seen it all; coded keypads, infrared alarm lasers, retina 
scans. And regardless of how complex a security system was there was 
always a way to bypass, or better yet disarm it, as the blonde had 
discovered during the course of her chosen vocation. With the knowledge 
she had gained she could make quite the tidy profit as a cat burglar if 
she were so disposed to a career change. Being a professional *and* an 
adept contract killer incorporated most if not all of the skills of a 
thief and a spy put together. Breaking and entering, the art of 
disguise, subterfuge and misdirection--if one wished to be a truly 
consummate assassin then these talents and more like them were required 
to be added to one&#39;s repertoire. After all, assassination targets were 
prone to surround themselves with a great deal of protection. Seldom a 
sniper rifle on a rooftop or at an open window was sufficient; it was 
the reason why such a method was labelled as amateurish.

Mireille lifted her head from the smashed camera and walked a few steps 
to the left side of the gate, before looking back over her shoulder at 
Kirika, the soft curve of a small, almost playful smile once more on her 
lips. &quot;Let&#39;s tread lightly and keep the noise level to a whisper, okay?&quot; 
she instructed with a light-hearted lilt. The woman turned around fully, 
and then drew her loaded Walther P99 from its holster, her left hand 
retrieving its companion piece--a silencer--from under her coat a moment 
later. &quot;People who have their sleep disturbed do have a propensity to 
wake up cranky,&quot; Mireille went on as she securely attached the silencer 
to the end of her pistol. &quot;And noisy late night callers are apt to 
invite considerably greater ire from them.&quot; She hoisted her gun upright 
in her hand and arched an expectant eyebrow at her counterpart.

&quot;Understood,&quot; Kirika said, grasping the hint. She abided by her 
partner&#39;s &#39;suggestion&#39; and pulled out her Beretta from her skirt&#39;s 
waistband behind her back, a silencer following from under the garment 
that was quickly fastened to the weapon.

Mireille nodded in approval, and then turned her head back to the gate. 
The black iron wrought structure was blessedly unlocked and even a tad 
ajar, meaning that she and Kirika didn&#39;t have to scale its tall bars to 
gain entry. It wouldn&#39;t have been especially difficult for the nimble 
duo, but two young women climbing over ten foot spiked rails in the 
middle of the night while haloed by the light of streetlamps wasn&#39;t 
exactly subtle and was better to be steered clear of. However, Ryosuke 
and Vincent had obviously already breached Laroque&#39;s security and had 
had the--albeit unintentional--courtesy to leave their access route 
open. It should simply be a matter of tracing the false Noir&#39;s footsteps 
until Mireille and Kirika caught up to them, the majority of the dangers 
having been already neutralised by tonight&#39;s first intruders into the 
estate. Or so the blonde hoped. Judging by the aggressively trounced 
security measures at the front gate, Ryosuke and Vincent were not loath 
to use lethal force against anything that stood in their path. Mireille 
trusted that they had continued in the same fierce style throughout 
their infiltration.

&quot;With any luck those two will have cleared the entire way for us,&quot; 
Mireille remarked, voicing her thoughts for Kirika&#39;s benefit, even 
though she was certain the darkhaired girl had parallel hopes. But there 
was no harm in sharing one&#39;s feelings, particularly when on an 
assignment of sorts... and particularly these days, when Mireille was 
championing open and frequent communication between herself and her 
reticent partner. True, they had their own unique manner of conversing 
during &#39;business hours&#39;; an instinctive one that was far beyond the 
level of mundane verbal communication, but when it came to personal 
feelings after hours they were both clearly inept at expressing 
themselves. It was Mireille&#39;s aspiration that that would change soon, 
but until then in her view every little bit helped.

Kirika merely mumbled her concurrence in her traditional fashion, but 
then Mireille hadn&#39;t expected much more. Change didn&#39;t happen overnight, 
even during a long night like this one.

Mireille slipped through the open gate and inside the compound--her 
introverted partner in tow--and instantly deviated from the illuminated 
gravel path leading to the mansion and onto the pitch-black section of 
lawn on her left instead, glad to be out of the light that laid her bare 
and back in the safety of the shadows&#39; shroud. She then paused there in 
the murk, crouched low in the dewy grass with Kirika next to her, the 
pair delaying their approach for a few seconds to give their eyes time 
to adjust to the darkness.

As Mireille&#39;s night vision gradually kicked in, she slowly made out a 
handful of dark shapes scattered haphazardly across the grounds, 
predominantly in the left expanse where she and Kirika presently were. 
It didn&#39;t take the assassin long to realise that the silhouettes were in 
fact the bodies of more guards, put to death as Ryosuke and Vincent had 
stormed through. There had to be greater than half a dozen dead men 
lying about under the cloudy night&#39;s sky, their final resting place 
looking like the spot where they had originally fallen. No effort at all 
had seemingly been made on the false Noir&#39;s part to drag the carcasses 
into a secluded corner of the estate and suitably hide the evidence of 
their incursion. It was an act of either sloppiness or arrogance, but 
Mireille already knew the answer to that one. It would seem that Ryosuke 
and Vincent held nothing save contempt for their victims, impending and 
otherwise. In any case, the blonde now understood that people *had* been 
sent to investigate the abandoned front gate, it was just that none of 
them had lasted the distance there. Ryosuke and his partner had 
evidently utilised the pall of darkness covering the compound to their 
extreme advantage and systemically slaughtered them all on a first come, 
first kill basis. Mireille doubted whether any of the sentries had even 
seen their end coming.

The trail of corpses was a beneficial if macabre sight to Mireille, 
sketching an even clearer path for her and Kirika to follow. And follow 
it they did without a sound and at a swift pace, their pistols ready to 
be brought to bear against any surviving guard who made an unexpected 
appearance and threatened to compromise their stealthy infiltration. 
Mireille was a bit concerned about the presence of dogs on the premises 
as well, but thankfully there appeared to be no troublesome and 
generally vicious canines wandering around, or else they were tied up in 
their kennels somewhere, snoozing away like their owners in the mansion. 
Guard dogs were harder to deal with than their human counterparts; they 
had the habit of sniffing out a trespasser regardless of where she or he 
secreted themselves. The animals couldn&#39;t be reasoned with like human 
beings either; money and sex appeal counted for squat, and they held 
unwavering faith in their noses and instincts to not be deterred by 
misdirection... well, unless that misdirection involved masking one&#39;s 
scent, which was tricky to do and more bother than it was worth. 
Mireille found it much simpler to just shoot any inquisitive dog that 
detected her scent and wandered too close, then subsequently their 
handler a split second later depending on their proximity. A lost mutt 
was written off with significantly less concern than an actual person.

The disjointed, gruesome trail of limp-limbed bodies led to the west 
wing of Laroque&#39;s residence, and vanished around a corner of the 
building. Mireille and Kirika stuck close to the manor as they traced 
after it, the barren flowerbeds bordering its outer walls as much space 
as they would allow between them. Up this close the blonde assassin 
could see that a layer of moss or lichen coated the lower bricks of the 
house, while a thick covering of ivy and other viny plant life climbed 
trellises fastened to the walls, their tendrils stretching all the way 
to the second floor windows and if left to grow unchecked could very 
possibly reach the gutters if not the roof proper. If Mireille and 
Kirika had wished to they could probably use the trellises as a ladder 
and enter the mansion via an upper floor window. Although they didn&#39;t, 
it was still worthwhile to make note of--if they required a quick escape 
route while on the second level they could always clamber down the side 
of the house with relative ease and speed.

The two female assassins rounded the corner cautiously, wary of possible 
threats, before immediately discovering a set of steps that led to a 
side entrance to the manor, a couple of trashcans neighbouring it. As 
they moved closer they saw that the alternate entrance&#39;s door was wide 
open, but with only more darkness spilling outside. Ryosuke and Vincent 
had no doubt entered Laroque&#39;s house through there.

Mireille and Kirika placed their backs to the mansion&#39;s wall, heedless 
of the flowerbeds now, before edging nearer to the side entrance, the 
Corsican at the point as usual. She poked her blonde head carefully into 
the doorway and took quick stock of the interior, her sharp gaze darting 
this way and that, covering all angles. The doorway opened into a 
kitchen as old-fashioned as the exterior of the house, but it appeared 
well equipped with the occasional modern appliance discreetly positioned 
in amongst the outdated here and there, and was also in immaculate 
condition--Laroque must have hired hands, Mireille surmised. There 
wasn&#39;t a single bloodied corpse sullying the floor either, which did 
work to the spotless room&#39;s advantage. Dead bodies did have a tendency 
to spoil any d&eacute;cor.

The coast clear, Mireille signalled to Kirika that it was safe to 
proceed with a brusque wave of her hand, and then after bounding atop 
the uppermost step slinked inside the kitchen, her Walther&#39;s sight 
focusing on an open doorway ahead while she favoured a closed one to her 
left with a watchful eye. Kirika tagged along behind the woman, her own 
gaze momentarily zipping all over the room as she took in her new 
surroundings. It then finally settled on the hallway viewable through 
the open door in front of them, where Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s unsightly 
trail resumed with gory grandeur.

If Laroque did have hired hands, then his maids were definitely going to 
have an unpleasant time cleaning the halls in the morning. Mireille&#39;s 
blue eyes left the closed door alone and moved back to the open doorway 
to join Kirika&#39;s, where she had noted during her first perusal of the 
kitchen that yet more guards lay massacred in an adjoining short 
corridor that terminated at a shut door, a corridor which also crossed 
perpendicularly with a second. Pale, diffused light produced from an 
unknown source shone from the latter hall&#39;s left and muted though it 
was, it was just enough to permit the woman and her colleague to 
distinguish the passages&#39; deceased inhabitants in superior detail than 
they had with the sentries&#39; likewise departed fellows outside, the 
corpses&#39; faces being painted an eerie and appropriate deathly white.

Men in suits were sprawled on the floor and slouched against the walls 
in all manner of arrangements, and large amounts of their blood soaked 
the luxuriant carpeting with dark stains and not to mention their once 
clean and crisp clothing as well. As Mireille and Kirika crept into the 
corridor ahead of them and to the intersection with all due prudence, 
they saw that the grievous injuries inflicted upon the guards were the 
cause of such major haemorrhaging. Their wounds were chiefly localised 
to the neck and throat areas, and the Corsican observed that there was 
evidence of the garrotting she had seen on the guard at the gate on a 
few of the luckless men. Others had had their throats slit or stabbed 
with savage intensity, their arteries ruptured and the slash or thrust 
deep, oft cases to the bone. A couple of sentries even had their heads 
bent at nauseatingly odd angles, their necks obviously broken, likely 
with sheer brute force--a simple but rather inelegant method of killing 
that was beyond Mireille&#39;s own physical capability, not that she would 
be one to adopt the crude technique. There was also the sporadic guard 
who had received punctures with a blade to their back instead of their 
throat, with the noticeable intent to pierce a lung considering where it 
had been plunged. Not a single gunshot wound was to be seen, although 
there were a few handguns strewn about, the dropped firearms of the 
sentries who had managed to pull their weapons from their holsters 
before meeting the Reaper.

All in all, the carnage wrought along each of the two hallways was an 
impressive feat for what it was--so many slain without an apparent alarm 
being raised or even a retaliatory shot fired. Mireille deduced that by 
concentrating their attacks to the throat and neck, Ryosuke and Vincent 
had prevented their quarries from screaming or from making the slightest 
sound above a liquid gurgle, and hence thwarted the stricken guards from 
warning their comrades. The blows to the lungs had probably created a 
similar affect; as soon as air from the outside had invaded the breached 
organs merely continuing to breath would have been more than enough 
challenge for the victim. Still, it must have been very hard for the 
false Noir to actually inflict the silencing wounds to each guard before 
he could cry out, especially if more than one were alerted to their 
presence at the time. Ryosuke and Vincent had surely butchered the men 
with a speed and efficiency on par with Kirika&#39;s. A false Noir they may 
be, but it would seem that they did have the skill to merit the title. 
However, Mireille was not concerned. It wasn&#39;t as if she and Kirika were 
pushovers. And, after all, they had been the true Noir. A copy could 
never surpass the original, and an imitation had even less of a chance.

The hallways themselves where Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s achievements were 
put on grisly display were in the same vein as the kitchen and the 
mansion&#39;s exterior; an archaic motif straight out of the eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries. It was as if Mireille and Kirika had 
stumbled back in time somehow and right into a traditional manor house 
of that antiquated period. Oil paintings of people dressed in the 
customary attire of the past hundred to two hundred years hung on the 
walls together with correspondingly styled renditions of landscapes of 
Europe long ago lost to modernisation. Placed intermittently along the 
length of the hallway&#39;s walls were ornaments consisting of magnificently 
crafted vases and statuettes to name a couple, exhibited on small 
pedestals befitting the era they stemmed from.

Collectively the value of the objects in the corridors alone had to 
total in the hundred thousands--a grand fortune indeed. Any art dealer 
or thief would be downright ecstatic to get their hands on even one of 
the masterpieces Mireille saw; she was sure that the splattered blood 
marking some of the antiques would not deter them in the least. And it 
could probably be cleaned off rather easily, and without so much as a 
thought to how it got there given by their new owners. Albert Laroque 
was unmistakably an exceptionally rich man, with his security 
precautions clearly warranted. Maybe Ryosuke and Vincent weren&#39;t here 
for an assassination at all but in fact to pilfer a few choice 
artefacts. Mireille didn&#39;t honestly believe that, however it was still a 
possibility, albeit a slim one. She wouldn&#39;t know the false Noir&#39;s true 
intentions for definite until she actually came across them, and even 
then perhaps not. Ryosuke and Vincent wouldn&#39;t be alive for very long 
after the meeting, of course. And the Corsican wasn&#39;t the type to grant 
her targets any last words.

Mireille stopped in the middle of the crossroads dividing the hallways, 
Kirika mimicking in accordance to her older partner&#39;s action. The blonde 
assassin cast her eyes down the left span of corridor, where she had 
glimpsed an interesting sight in her initial cursory glance of the area 
that she had performed before she and Kirika had risked advancing 
further. At the end of the corridor was the origin of the pallid light 
that streaked weakly into the passage. A door stood wide open there, 
baring a room that&#39;s purpose was immediately obvious. Inside were a pair 
of guards--quite dead, naturally--one face down on the floor bleeding 
from his throat and the other sitting in a computer chair, his chin on 
his chest with the rest of his body just as slack. And in front of that 
man was a desk with a dozen television monitors stacked atop one another 
in three rows, no doubt the control centre for the security camera 
network set up around the manor. The equipment looked out of place in a 
house that was a tribute to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; a 
cubbyhole of modern technology in an antiquated world. However, the 
technology at the moment was about as effective as it would have been if 
utilised in that old era. All the monitors&#39; screens displayed a 
noiseless snowstorm at night, black and white static in a never-ending 
tumult. Ryosuke and Vincent had evidently taken out the surveillance 
system, and in one fell swoop disabled all the cameras throughout the 
estate. It favoured Mireille and Kirika as much as it did their enemies, 
though; there was no need to worry about being captured on film whilst 
tiptoeing around the house.

The trail of bodies the young women had been using to direct them to 
their prey more or less concluded at the ghastly scene of mass murder at 
the corridors&#39; junction, but both assassins espied a faint glow of light 
coming from the tiny crack formed between an ajar door and its doorjamb 
to their right, near the far end of the longer hallway. Like nighttime 
insects to a lamppost&#39;s light, Mireille and Kirika were attracted to it, 
stealing down the passageway towards the door, their pistols suddenly 
held just a little tighter in their ready hands.

Ryosuke and Vincent, their distorted reflections--they were near, very 
near. Mireille could practically feel it, like some sort of sixth sense; 
a sensation of inexplicable anticipation, although it was neither 
exciting nor uneasy, just... an impression of something up ahead. She 
was sure Kirika felt the same thing. It was the innate instincts of an 
assassin at work, an intuition that similarly forewarned one when an 
assailant was just around the corner or an unseen gun sight was being 
trained on them from afar. Mireille was sure the foundation of the 
strange sense was based squarely in logic rather than in some sort of 
Zen-like awareness, the feeling doubtless the product of external 
stimuli ignored by the conscious mind and instead analysed by the 
unconscious, such as sights and sounds just on the brink of perception. 
Regardless of the feeling&#39;s descent, the fact remained that the false 
Noir was very likely beyond that door; the Corsican was almost positive 
that they were. This long night was drawing to its conclusion. The lone 
executioners--Death--had arrived; let the final scene of this film noir 
commence.

Mireille and Kirika halted outside the door, close enough to perceive 
the intricate wood grain stylised on its varnished surface. The woman 
looked at her shorter partner for confirmation that she was prepared, 
though it was a superfluous gesture. As soon as her blue eyes locked 
with Kirika&#39;s brown, she knew by their stanch appearance that the 
darkhaired girl was ready--she was *always* ready. Though resolute the 
young assassin&#39;s gaze may be--hard even--it was not cruel or unfeeling 
in any way. Unwavering determination is all that existed in the orbs&#39; 
still depths. Kirika was a girl with a gun and with the full intent to 
use it, yet a girl she remained--she had no penchant for murder in spite 
of the number of lives she had taken and her aptitude for it. A 
cold-blooded killer she was not. And never would be, if Mireille had her 
way. And never would be... again....

Mireille exhaled calmly and then held her next breath, before she 
suddenly burst into the room behind the door, shoving it completely open 
with her left shoulder as she strafed swiftly inside, bringing up her 
Walther in her right hand. Kirika sprung through the doorway a fraction 
of a second after her, sticking a metre away from the Corsican&#39;s side 
and brandishing her own firearm. It wasn&#39;t a stealthy entrance by any 
means, but Mireille had elected to charge in rather than creep inside to 
maintain the element of surprise indefinitely. She believed the sneaker 
approach would have been less effective and potentially treacherous; 
Ryosuke and Vincent quite possibly would have heard their 
entrance--virtually silent as it would have been--and then Mireille and 
Kirika&#39;s advantage over them would have been forfeit. Perhaps the woman 
was overestimating the men&#39;s abilities, but to underestimate them would 
be to invite danger. Therefore Mireille had decided to simply dash 
inside the room. It was noisy, but should catch the room&#39;s occupants 
unawares, regardless of who they were.

Mireille took in the surroundings of the room in a mere instant, but 
only a small part of her attention was dedicated to the chore. It was 
clearly a library or an exceptionally well-resourced study furnished in 
an identical theme as the rest of mansion, with ornate shelves packed 
almost to capacity with countless books lining the left and right walls 
from one end nearly completely to the other. A third and fourth set of 
shelves equally stocked with texts roosted above their mates on roughly 
four-foot wide hardwood balconies, each accessed by a stepladder 
constructed of the same material. They stood tall enough to touch the 
high ceiling of the rectangular library, much like the matching array of 
shelves below them that scraped the underside of their perch.

The tomes that made their home in the library were arranged in an 
orderly fashion on the shelves, not a speck of dust to be seen coating a 
single binding, and most if not all were bound in leather covers dyed in 
sombre hues; the trappings of classic books or very old ones, likely the 
second when taking into account the other rare and priceless items that 
resided on the premises. Mireille mused whether Laroque had amassed all 
these artefacts and ancient texts out of an interest in those fields, 
and that what she had been seeing while she and Kirika had traipsed 
through his house&#39;s halls were pieces of his collection. It would 
explain the sheer volume of items on display.

A few small round tables with accompanying cosy-looking chairs and a 
couple of two-seater sofas with cushions were present in the middle of 
the room, presumably placed there for readers to avail themselves of and 
relax in respectively while pouring over a book penned during a time 
long ago. There wasn&#39;t a book lying out of place on any of the 
brilliantly polished and finely crafted tables currently however, the 
majority of the tomes nestled away comfortably in their spots on the 
bookshelves. Yet there were some glaring gaps in amongst the texts 
sitting on the many shelves, several of them quite thick suggesting the 
removal of a number of books.

The missing tomes were accounted for where the greater bulk of 
Mireille&#39;s attention was focused; past the room&#39;s d&eacute;cor and towards a 
bulky dark oak desk and red wine coloured leather chair at the far end 
of the library, which were situated in front of a huge window made up of 
a trio of thinner ones with arched white frames, the central window the 
tallest of the three. Irregular, jumbled piles of books taken from their 
original resting places were assembled on the desk, numerous scattered 
across it, one or two even deposited seemingly without a care on the 
floor. And hunched over the stacks of tomes with their backs to Mireille 
and Kirika were two men, both sifting through the literary mess 
obviously in search of a specific title. One picked out and examined the 
contents of individual books with meticulous exactitude, while his 
companion rummaged around the heap with contrasting frenetic 
impetuousness, occasionally tossing books aside in frustration. The 
false Noir, Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu, just as Mireille had 
predicted.

A lamp on the desk provided illumination for the duo&#39;s labours, its 
light having been what had lured Mireille and Kirika to their location 
in the first place. It gently saturated the library in a soft orange 
glow akin to the setting sun, the twilight casting elongated shadows on 
the bookshelves and ceiling, the silhouettes of Ryosuke and Vincent the 
tallest of them all. Giant, distorted images of the killers stretched 
out from their feet, the limbs spindly and spider-like, warped to 
otherworldly proportions--more like monsters than men. Perhaps it was a 
glimpse into a form of mirror, the dark reflections of corrupt souls. 
Mireille wondered what her shadow-self looked like. She didn&#39;t check.

At the clamour of Mireille and her partner&#39;s dramatic and abrupt 
entrance, the hitmen immediately ceased their rummaging, although their 
subsequent reactions varied in tone rather significantly. Vincent spun 
around to face the opposite end of the room and its new occupants a 
scarce instant after Mireille had crossed the doorway&#39;s threshold, an 
extended switchblade with an edge of about four inches long gripped 
between his bared teeth, and a feral, maniacal grin splitting his 
features as a result. His amber eyes matched the ferocity of his grin, 
burning with a fierce intensity somehow made deeper by the understated 
light of the room, reminiscent of how a feline&#39;s eyes sparkled in places 
of low illumination. However, upon sighting Mireille he blinked, his 
eyes losing their glint and his grin no longer quite so crazed. Instead 
Vincent&#39;s expression became nigh on a leer of a lecherous old man... 
that wasn&#39;t that much different from the previous look, the blonde dryly 
reconsidered.

Ryosuke on the other hand didn&#39;t even bother turning around to greet his 
foes. He straightened to his full height and lowered his arms slowly to 
his sides at Mireille and Kirika&#39;s arrival--as if he had all the time in 
the world--and settled on merely looking over his right shoulder in the 
young women&#39;s direction, his pale profile exhibiting an utter calm and 
composure in spite of being taken by surprise and put at a potentially 
deadly disadvantage. There was contempt also; his one visible violet eye 
smouldering coldly with it through his white bangs while the thin 
compaction of his lips wordlessly spoke of distaste at the unwanted 
interruption.

Mireille noticed that clasped in Ryosuke&#39;s right hand was a length of 
piano wire, either end fastened to a black plastic handle. It was the 
kind of wire used for anything but inside pianos, with it&#39;s lightweight 
and non-metallic composition making it a handy tool of murder that could 
pass through metal detectors uncontested and be carried effortlessly on 
one&#39;s person. If Mireille were ever inclined to take a literal 
&#39;hands-on&#39; style to the fundamentals of her job it would most certainly 
be one of the instruments she would employ. It appeared that Ryosuke 
thought on a similar vein to the blonde assassin; it was clear that he 
was responsible for the garrotting marks on the throats of the guards 
seen earlier, and, while on the subject, that his associate Vincent laid 
claim to the knife wounds. But as for who snapped the odd sentry&#39;s neck, 
it could have been either of them. Or even both.

While their responses for the most part differed, one particular thing 
was mutual amongst both Ryosuke and Vincent--neither exhibited any trace 
of fear whatsoever. The fact didn&#39;t unnerve Mireille however; it simply 
meant that the men were not trifling poseurs like so many other people 
who inhabited the underworld. But the woman had known that for quite 
some time now, ever since she had exchanged fire with one half of the 
false Noir in Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental. Pretenders who merely 
talked big but were in reality just small fries would not have been able 
to accomplish the feats of the kind Ryosuke and Vincent had. What&#39;s more 
they were supposedly well known in the underbelly of Japan&#39;s society and 
were allied with Kaede--the sharpest thorn in Soldats&#39; side 
presently--to boot, with one of the men her brother no less. With skill 
came reputation, and Ryosuke and Vincent were not for want in either.

&quot;Caught in the act red-handed,&quot; Mireille remarked sardonically in a cool 
and self-assured voice as she moved further into the library, 
repositioning herself to the rear of the mini lounge running down its 
centre--a spot better suited to imparting cover in the event of a 
firefight. Her pistol&#39;s sight remained steady on the immobile Ryosuke&#39;s 
back as she sidestepped carefully away from the room&#39;s doorway, Kirika&#39;s 
Beretta imitating the woman&#39;s Walther as she followed the blonde&#39;s lead, 
except that its target was the man&#39;s shorter companion, Vincent, and his 
chest. &quot;I never knew you two were such avid book lovers that you would 
resort to petty burglary.&quot;

Mireille had been tempted to simply blaze away with her handgun at 
Ryosuke and Vincent&#39;s defenceless backs as soon as she had seen them, 
yet despite that near overpowering compulsion she had somehow managed to 
stay her hand... for now. While a scant couple of days earlier this week 
she would not have hesitated for even the smallest sliver of a second at 
blasting several 9mm Parabellum rounds the false Noir&#39;s way, now, after 
the men&#39;s prior behaviour tonight, her curiosity was grudgingly piqued. 
People had died, people who had been assets to her trade... as vulgar 
and trivial as Simon and his associates had been. Still, Mireille wanted 
explanations as to why they&#39;d had to give up their lives, and, in 
relation to that answer, she was confident she would also learn why the 
false Noir were more or less ransacking a well-to-do man&#39;s library in 
suburban Paris. Moreover, she was *not* a mindless tool of Soldats or 
Breffort&#39;s unquestioningly carrying out their bidding with blinkers on, 
and nor was Kirika; they both had their own free will to handle matters 
as *they* pleased and always would. Desperation to stop the 
deterioration of her close relationship with her partner had fuelled the 
Corsican&#39;s passion to slay Ryosuke and Vincent immediately during their 
last confrontation, but this time with a more level head on her 
shoulders and lighter heart in her chest the woman could regard the 
situation with a judicious mind. It was another troubling reminder of 
why sentimentality had no place amid those who lived by the gun.

Vincent cautiously reached up to his mouth and removed the switchblade 
from between his teeth, his rich amber eyes shifting warily from 
Kirika&#39;s raised weapon to Mireille&#39;s, knowing that to provoke them with 
aggressive movement would cause bullets to fly and people to die--namely 
him. &quot;If it isn&#39;t babe and brat,&quot; he then drawled with a snide smirk as 
he lowered his arm with the same earlier degree of prudence, his broken 
French dripping with mocking. &quot;Took you long enough. You know your 
crispy predecessors were lot better at finding us.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Mireille replied icily, her expression just as frosty as her 
tone. But only for an instant. The next moment her face brightened, 
easily schooled to cordiality attributable to frequent practice, a faint 
taunting smile teasing her lips upwards. &quot;Yet I must say your sloppy 
handiwork in the shop off Rue de Prony was most helpful in pointing us 
in the right direction,&quot; she then retorted haughtily to the triad 
affiliate, although her eyes stayed firmly on Ryosuke, trusting 
unconditionally that Kirika had the other man well in hand, just as the 
girl likewise trusted that she had the tall hitman restrained.

Out of the corner of her eye Mireille saw an angry sneer flash across 
Vincent&#39;s face before his own features were disciplined, the demeaning 
lopsided leer resurfacing. So she had struck a nerve. Interesting. It 
appeared that Vincent was indeed a hothead as the Corsican had suspected 
from his deeds--or more to the point, from the extent of the butchery 
inflicted upon his victims--thus far, albeit a hothead with his temper 
under tight rein. However, there were always methods to slacken those 
reins or even loose them outright, and it appeared that Vincent possibly 
drew on killing as an outlet for his rage--the period when he himself 
let his control wane, voluntarily or not. Small, seemingly 
inconsequential details like this on a target had proved useful to 
Mireille in the past; every facet of a hit&#39;s personality regardless of 
how minor had the potential to be used against them, be they actual 
character traits or behavioural habits. A professional assassin gathered 
these little gems and utilised them as they could, turning that late 
night cigarette break in an alley into a death sentence for their 
target, one markedly faster than the sluggish ravages of cancer.

&quot;Soldats...&quot; Ryosuke suddenly uttered in a soft whisper as he tilted his 
head back towards the ceiling, his profile taking on a distant look 
while the lid of his sole visible eye sagged lazily. &quot;Their veins indeed 
run deep and long, the very world the body of the beast. Where there is 
no such thing as coincidence... just ever watchful eyes.&quot; His words, 
while somewhat cryptic and more than a little poetic were expressed in 
perfect, flowing French--a huge improvement over his partner&#39;s meagre 
ability in the language. In addition they sounded as if they were spoken 
primarily to himself, the black clad man temporarily oblivious to his 
company in the library with him.

Nevertheless, Mireille did not miss Ryosuke&#39;s observations on the 
global, ancient, and secret organisation. That he--and by association 
Vincent--had admitted knowing of the existence of Soldats out loud 
bestowed extra credibility to the soundness of Breffort&#39;s briefing on 
Kaede and her pseudo Black Hands that had taken place weeks ago in his 
office. While it would have been unlikely if Ryosuke and his counterpart 
had not been aware of the clandestine group, it was still comforting to 
know for sure that they did. One never could tell with Soldats. They 
weaved deception like a spider weaved a web--intricate and ensnaring, 
with escape an extremely difficult if not impossible prospect for the 
captured fly. But in contrast to a spider&#39;s web, the fly rarely realised 
when it had been caught in the network of threads. And that was where 
the real danger lied, a danger Mireille was all too conscious of.

Vincent favoured Ryosuke with a sidelong look for a fleeting moment 
before his eyes snapped back to Mireille and Kirika again, along with 
the pistols levelled in his and his comrade&#39;s direction. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he 
agreed, although the Corsican assassin didn&#39;t believe he truly 
comprehended the white-haired man&#39;s statements, &quot;and they hire young, 
too. On top of usual Soldats dogs and now Soldats bitches--as pretty as 
they are--&quot; He inclined his head Mireille&#39;s way, leering at her wantonly 
as he licked his upper lip in what he probably thought to be an enticing 
manner. However all it enticed was the bitter taste of bile to fill the 
back of the blonde&#39;s throat. &quot;--We have a cute Soldats puppy!&quot; Vincent 
snickered and grinned condescendingly at Kirika, but the stoic--or was 
that na&iuml;ve?--girl merely stared back at him blankly, unaffected by the 
jibe.

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised at just how young,&quot; Mireille said without emotion, 
her veneer of geniality gone not due to the barbs--although they didn&#39;t 
best please her, either--but due to the foul memories they invoked. She 
knew very well at exactly how young an age Soldats was willing to pluck 
their recruits from. A childhood destroyed with the murder of her 
parents and elder brother, another corrupted by the abhorrent deeds she 
was forced to perform--and both children owning their torment and loss 
of innocence to the twisted machinations of a heartless woman belonging 
to the organisation. Oh yes, Mireille was intimately versed in how low 
Soldats could sink in the age of choosing their &#39;followers&#39; and in their 
morals, if the group even had any principles of decent merit to start 
with.

&quot;But despite what you think, we are *not* members of Soldats,&quot; Mireille 
continued with emphatic insistence, her voice stern and brooking no 
mistake. She wasn&#39;t strictly lying per se; neither she nor Kirika were 
part of the society. While it could be said they were working for 
Breffort, a prominent follower of the worldwide group, it was by their 
own decision; Mireille preferred to perceive it as working for 
themselves, with their goals happening to coincide with Soldats&#39;. &#39;Dogs&#39; 
they were certainly not.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Vincent said with exaggerated curiosity, lifting an inquisitive 
eyebrow and pulling a face to complement it. &quot;Then, why you come after 
us? Besides the obvious....&quot; He winked mischievously at the beautiful 
blonde and leered at her yet again, as if some perverted attraction to 
his ego had brought her before him and Ryosuke. Sure, Vincent&#39;s 
remarkably good looks could have also been considered as a lure, but in 
this case the adage &#39;beauty is only skin deep&#39; couldn&#39;t have been more 
spot on.

&quot;Why do you think?&quot; Mireille snapped, frowning slightly. A strange 
sensation of anxiousness started to creep into the assassin&#39;s chest from 
somewhere deep down below, an unpleasant tingling progressively flooding 
the area slowly that seemed to cause it to constrict with increasing 
tension, as if an invisible hand were pressing down on her breastbone. 
&quot;You stole something of ours,&quot; she went on undaunted regardless, 
ignoring the odd and troubling feeling. &quot;It may not be something we 
like, or even want, but it&#39;s ours nonetheless.&quot; The woman&#39;s voice 
lowered to a grim timbre, a dark cloud passing over her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s a 
name *earned*, not given, nor taken.&quot; Mireille&#39;s expression then 
darkened to mirror her gaze, recalling her own folly and ignorance in 
dubbing herself and Kirika as Noir without any genuine knowledge of the 
full significance of the name. &quot;And its price.... The Black Hands are 
called as such for a reason; only through both parties staining their 
own black with grievous sins can they be truly worthy of it.&quot;

Mireille heard Kirika shift her weight uneasily, a subtle rubbing of a 
shoe sole on carpet. The girl understood, perhaps even understanding 
better than she. A designation earned through violence and murder, 
through showing no pity, no remorse. The Eternal Darkness... Mireille 
mused whether Noir were christened that because its two halves resided 
always in shadow, the light having shunned them for their immoral 
transgressions. Noir, the Black Hands, the Eternal Darkness... so many 
names yet all with identical undertones, identical meanings. It was no 
wonder Mireille despised the title and its connection to her and Kirika 
so much.

Ryosuke and Vincent merely looked at Mireille for a few moments, before 
the older gangster bowed his head, his stark white hair hiding his face 
from view. &quot;I see,&quot; he spoke softly and in his native Japanese tongue, 
once again his words apparently for his own ears, &quot;so that was her 
motive. Hmph.&quot;

Mireille wasn&#39;t sure whether or not Ryosuke was aware she could 
comprehend every single word he was murmuring, but she deliberately 
didn&#39;t react to the statement in any way. Feigning ignorance was a 
typical and widely used technique of lulling a careless individual into 
a false sense of security, and consequently enticing her or him into 
making a slip-up that could then be employed against them. Furthermore, 
there was very little sense in freely giving information to those you 
didn&#39;t trust without receiving anything in return. &#39;Take as much as you 
can and give only what you must&#39;. Wise words to live by... that is, 
unless one happened to be involved in a romantic relationship with a 
cute, but introverted, Japanese girl. But naturally significant others 
were exempt from the axiom.

As could be expected, Kirika--Mireille&#39;s aforementioned &#39;significant 
other&#39;--didn&#39;t respond to Ryosuke&#39;s words either, but with her 
distinctly Japanese features it was a marvel he didn&#39;t realise that at 
least she understood him. Perhaps the man simply didn&#39;t care who heard 
him, be they friend or foe. It certainly would fit his profile of being 
supremely arrogant. At any rate, Mireille wondered whom &#39;her&#39; was 
referring to. Ryosuke&#39;s sister, Kaede, perhaps? She was the only female 
the blonde knew who had links to the black clad killer.

Ryosuke raised his head, his visible violet eye swinging around to 
favour Mireille with a piercing Cyclops glare. &quot;So Noir stands before 
us,&quot; he declared in a louder voice than his previous though without 
fanfare of any sort, obviously not very impressed being in the presence 
of a purported legend. But to Mireille, it could have been as if he had 
bellowed the words from a high cliff top. The peculiar anxiousness that 
had been steadily building inside her was suddenly recognised as what it 
really was--dread, and dread well justified, now. In concert with that 
insight the tightness in her chest seized her with full force, the 
unseen hand on her breastbone a vice-like pressure that she believed was 
on the verge of crushing her. She felt queasy, her stomach churning all 
of a sudden like an ocean assaulted by an unexpected storm, once calm 
currents rudely unsettled by its fierce winds.

Ryosuke and Vincent did not know the faces or the real names behind 
Noir; they never had--until now, that is. Mireille cursed herself for 
her foolishness, both past and present. It had been a gamble accepting 
Breffort&#39;s mission, a gamble whether Ryosuke and Vincent knew her and 
Kirika, the identities of the authentic Black Hands. But apparently they 
had not. It had been a gamble lost, and where the stakes were high 
indeed. However, when up against a house of Soldats&#39; like the dice 
always came up showing snake eyes--this particular house always won in 
one form or another. It was a fact Mireille had been aware of as a 
result of her prior dealings with the organisation yet had elected to 
disregard anyway, letting her fears over her and her partner&#39;s quiet 
life possibly being shattered sometime in the future if they didn&#39;t act 
to fog her judgement, and in turn allow herself to be manipulated. 
Sentimentality yet again to blame, and all evidently unnecessary. 
Hunting the men who had adopted the ancient title of Noir, forsaking a 
life which had up until that point been peaceful ever since the events 
at the Manor, compelling a reluctant and emotionally scarred Kirika to 
take up arms once again--all of this could have been prevented if the 
Corsican had simply stuck by her vow to never again be caught up in 
Soldats affairs, instead of permitting her heart to overrule her brain. 
Now that peaceful life was most certainly shattered by Mireille&#39;s own 
doing, with backing out of Breffort&#39;s mission bordering on impossible. 
She and Kirika were now forced to see it through to the end, their faces 
having been revealed and now marked by their quarry.

Mireille&#39;s countenance registered her distress for only a second despite 
the magnitude of her horrible realisation, the woman quickly recovering 
herself although internally she remained perturbed, to put it in the 
lightest vein. It was senseless dwelling on something that couldn&#39;t be 
changed... no matter how much she wished it to. Her and Kirika&#39;s 
assignment was virtually at its conclusion anyway; they had Ryosuke and 
Vincent at their mercy. She took solace in that. It would all be over 
momentarily.

&quot;Noir?&quot; Vincent said in disbelief mixed with derision, looking askance 
at Mireille and Kirika while he smirked scornfully. &quot;You mean there is 
actually a *real* Noir? And *these* two are it? Seriously?&quot; He talked in 
rapid-fire but faultless Japanese rather than in the French he 
frequently mangled, reverting back to a language he was more accustomed 
to in his incredulity.

&quot;Of course Noir is real,&quot; Ryosuke replied in a bitter cold tone as his 
dark ringed eye flicked to his partner, also lapsing back into Japanese. 
&quot;*She* wouldn&#39;t have had us assume the name, otherwise.&quot; The tall 
hitman&#39;s lone visible eye then found Mireille once more, before he at 
long last turned around to face her and his other adversary full on, the 
expression on his gaunt visage grim and his pitiless violet gaze boring 
into the blonde&#39;s own blue. &quot;Who better to remove us from the picture 
than Europe&#39;s supposed greatest assassins?&quot; he concluded in French, 
seemingly for his Corsican enemy&#39;s sake.

A short peep of a gasp was suddenly emitted from Kirika, cutting the 
tension that had been steadily escalating between Ryosuke and Mireille, 
and causing their hard shared stare to be disrupted as the former 
participant turned his eyes to the source of the interruption. 
&quot;Langonel&#39;s Manuscript...&quot; the lithe girl whispered in surprise as she 
angled her head slightly to the side, breaking her absolutely rigid, 
motionless stance for the first time since she had entered the library; 
reminiscent of statue being revived from its petrification. Her eyes 
strayed away from Vincent and to Ryosuke instead... or more accurately, 
to the book he held in his previously obscured left hand.

&quot;Langonel&#39;s...?&quot; Mireille half-repeated in amazement, by some incredible 
exertion of willpower managing to keep her gaze from deserting her 
designated target and instead gawk wide-eyed and open mouthed at Kirika 
next to her, wondering how her colleague recognised the text. To the 
blonde the tome in Ryosuke&#39;s hand looked like any other in the library; 
bound in brown leather cracked with age, and thick comprising of 
hundreds of pages, their edges discoloured to a pale yellow over the 
many decades. But admittedly she had never actually seen a copy of the 
book where Soldats&#39; and Noir&#39;s origins were documented despite her and 
her partner&#39;s fervent search for it in the past--all they had unearthed 
was that all copies were allegedly destroyed, which was clearly an 
erroneous belief now. Yet in truth Mireille had forgotten all about 
Langonel&#39;s Manuscript ever since she had let Kirika leave her side and 
return to the Manor and Altena&#39;s &#39;care&#39;. Her priorities and thoughts had 
been focused on a different, much more important matter than a mere book 
back then.

&quot;Hey, you found it!&quot; Vincent exclaimed in jubilation and still in 
Japanese. He grinned happily at his companion, the broad smile causing 
him to appear more like a beautiful woman than ever. &quot;Does this mean we 
can go home now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t allow that,&quot; Mireille declared sternly in French as 
she lifted her gun a tad higher for emphasis, spoiling the triad 
member&#39;s elation. But the blonde was feeling quite a bit better herself, 
her earlier restlessness somewhat alleviated. If the purpose of Ryosuke 
and Vincent&#39;s being in Paris was to retrieve the apparently sole 
surviving copy of Langonel&#39;s Manuscript, then it was safe to assume that 
the men indeed did yearn to become Noir. Which meant that they would 
eventually get it into their heads that the true Noir would have to be 
rubbed out before they could be considered as the genuine article. 
Perhaps then it wasn&#39;t for nothing that Mireille and Kirika had decided 
to embark down the black path once again. At least it was a little 
consolation for the sacrifices they&#39;d had to make. She did still feel 
guilty however, but she had done so ever since Breffort&#39;s briefing. She 
doubted that sentiment would dissipate any time soon, even after Kirika 
had laid down her gun to rest once again.

Ryosuke and Vincent looked at Mireille in surprise, although the emotion 
was more noticeable in the latter man. The Corsican assassin was aware 
of what she had allowed to let slip--she understood Japanese, or enough 
to comprehend its spoken form at any rate. But it was of no consequence, 
taking into account that in the following minute the gangsters would 
have both ceased to breathe.

&quot;You speak Japanese?&quot; Ryosuke said, obviously taken aback by the 
revelation despite his taciturn disposition. He glanced at Kirika for a 
moment, and then returned his gaze to Mireille. &quot;I suppose I can 
understand why. Strange to see a Japanese girl of her age paired with a 
woman like yourself, and going by the name of Noir. You must have an 
interesting story to tell.&quot;

&quot;Not one you&#39;ll ever hear,&quot; Mireille said with menace. She still talked 
in French, preferring to use that language to communicate with outsiders 
while here in France. It was the first time she had encountered anybody 
who had spoken in Japanese to her since meeting Kirika in Japan, and it 
did not sit well with her. Japanese was the tongue she and Kirika used 
as a private means of conversing with each other and to segregate 
strangers from their own little world. But if those strangers knew that 
language, then it was as if Mireille and Kirika&#39;s world was no longer so 
private, no longer so sacred; that the world consisted of more than just 
the two of them. Yet another reason to kill Ryosuke and Vincent, to kill 
the interlopers in her and her partner&#39;s private lives.

&quot;Wait a minute, you mean to tell me you speak Japanese?! Both of you?!&quot; 
Vincent cried, either not hearing Mireille&#39;s threat--no, promise--or 
simply ignoring it. &quot;I thought the brat was raised here or something and 
only knew French! Damn it, I was struggling with that stupid language 
for nothing!&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you want to do this here?&quot; Ryosuke inquired carefully of 
the blonde assassin, blocking out his comrade&#39;s whining. &quot;Guards still 
roam this place.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mireille insisted, aware that he wasn&#39;t looking to avoid a fight, 
only to avoid one happening here. She and Kirika had tried to slay him 
and Vincent; it was not something one of Ryosuke&#39;s--or his 
partner&#39;s--character forgave or forgot easily. Just like Mireille did 
not forgive them. &quot;You interfered in our lives... and I--we--want that 
book.&quot; Her desires for the tome were somewhat of an afterthought, 
although serious nonetheless. She didn&#39;t know how she and Kirika had 
overlooked Laroque&#39;s copy of Langonel&#39;s Manuscript residing in their 
home city of Paris during their hunt for the text--however, the Paris 
copy was supposed to have been lost in the fires of World War II--but 
regardless, she believed it would be best if it was in their possession. 
The book was related to the legend of Noir, after all. Maybe it would be 
even better if it were destroyed like all of its fellows, so nobody else 
Soldats follower or Noir aspirant could read of its words and attempt to 
establish another pair of Black Hands.

&quot;Then we have a problem,&quot; Ryosuke replied, slipping his piano wire into 
his right coat pocket, though keeping his hand in plain sight 
throughout. His body tensed as he prepared himself, his shoulders 
straightening, his muscles strengthening.

&quot;Yes. We do,&quot; Mireille stated simply. And then she pulled the trigger of 
her Walther P99. The already set striker was launched forwards into the 
gun, generating an explosive discharge that in turn propelled a 9mm 
Parabellum round out of its casing and down the silencer-extended 
barrel, straight at Ryosuke&#39;s chest--and all within the blink of an eye.

The bullet slammed into the upper left side of the gangster&#39;s torso, 
where his heart beat beneath the flesh and bone, and the impact caused 
him to jerk in the direction of the shot. He retained his footing 
however, and in spite of the by all rights mortal blow his face remained 
remarkably impassive, with scarcely a hint of a furrow in his brow.

Mireille, undeterred by Ryosuke&#39;s stoicism, rapidly followed up her 
first shot with another, and then another and another, sending two, 
three, then four muted slugs into his body. Yet each shot was only met 
with another flinch from the white-haired killer and a dull thud against 
his jet-black overcoat--no howls of pain, no spurts of blood; just aloof 
defiance, the man&#39;s expression almost mocking contrary to its detached 
veneer, as if challenging the blonde assassin while silently laughing at 
her unproductive efforts.

It took less than a second for Mireille&#39;s astute mind to comprehend why 
her bullets weren&#39;t affecting Ryosuke as they would a normal person, and 
consequently why the several shots she had fired at the man when she had 
initially clashed with him at the hotel hadn&#39;t fazed him. His overcoat 
was bulletproof. Mireille suspected it must be fashioned with more than 
just mainstream Kevlar, however. The stiff, nigh on unyielding manner in 
which the garment moved suggested that underneath the reinforced mesh of 
tough fibres dwelled a layer of interlocking plates, either hard baked 
ceramic or perhaps even stronger but heavier iron or steel, although if 
that was the case the overall weight of the overcoat must inflict a 
tremendous burden on the wearer--Ryosuke would have to possess a robust 
musculature hidden beneath his clothes to just stand upright. On top of 
the Kevlar and protective plates the black outer material of the 
overcoat had been treated with some sort of protective compound, giving 
it a glossy sheen that could easily be mistaken for the lustre of 
burnished leather to the untrained eye. On the whole, Ryosuke&#39;s overcoat 
could be equated to a modern day suit of armour--and him a black knight, 
in more ways than one--offering true resistance to gunfire unlike 
standard &#39;bulletproof&#39; vests. But while it was a notable illustration of 
ingenuity, it wasn&#39;t anything Mireille hadn&#39;t seen before. She recalled 
an equivalent tactic having been used by one of Altena&#39;s enclave at the 
Manor, except that particular follower had worn what had looked like an 
actual breastplate from medieval times under her robes.

In spite of his protection, Mireille believed that it still must hurt 
Ryosuke a great deal to be shot. The armoured exterior and interior of 
the overcoat would decrease a bullet&#39;s velocity considerably, but his 
body would still be left to endure the remainder of its kinetic energy, 
which would certainly be no small amount. Indeed, there was a good 
chance his slender and athletic build belayed an immense brawn.

But for all of the defence Ryosuke&#39;s overcoat granted him, his head 
remained uncovered and open to attack. Obviously sensing Mireille&#39;s 
intentions, Ryosuke swiftly raised his forearm to protect his face--his 
movement a blur of black--at the exact moment the woman redirected her 
aim to that vulnerable spot. Two rounds pounded into the intercepting 
limb and a third struck the centre of the gangster&#39;s open palm, the 
gloved hand closing into a fist after the hit.

Mireille held her fire then, the end of her pistol smoking but with 
naught to show for it. In answer to the temporary ceasefire from the 
blonde, Ryosuke relaxed his taut posture a tad and straightened himself 
to a more upright position, standing once again at his full height. As 
he did so he lowered his arm slowly from over his face and to his side, 
his fist opening to drop the squashed remnants of a 9mm Parabellum slug 
to the floor.

&quot;Impressive,&quot; Mireille remarked dryly as the bullet bounced along the 
carpet by the snow white-haired killer&#39;s feet, noting that her target&#39;s 
gloves were outfitted with similar elements to that of his overcoat. She 
imagined that sustaining a punch from his armour-plated fists would not 
be advisable. &quot;Now this time catch one in your teeth.&quot;

Ryosuke didn&#39;t respond to the sarcastic comment, at least not verbally. 
Instead he suddenly burst into motion with a speed that verged on 
inhuman, comparable with the likes of Kirika and Chloe, his weighty 
overcoat plainly no hindrance to him. He reached into his coat with his 
free hand in one fluid movement before Mireille even had a clue he *was* 
moving, and in the next instant a huge gleaming metal object was drawn 
from inside the garment&#39;s dark depths. Ryosuke angled his body so it was 
side-on to the Corsican in a flick of rigid black Kevlar, and levelled 
the object squarely at her chest with deliberate slowness in contrast to 
his prior alacrity. As such, Mireille was provided with a good look at 
the object--at the gun.

Ryosuke&#39;s firearm was the largest handgun Mireille had ever laid eyes 
on, its sheer size putting all Magnum variants to shame. Yet this 
pistol--hand-cannon more like--was definitely not of the .357 or .44 
family, although it did share a vague resemblance to a heavily modified 
.44 Magnum revolver. Instead it screamed of a custom model and make 
which had to be independently commissioned.

The gun was crafted in gleaming silver metal of the purest quality, 
polished until it was akin to a mirror, the reflections on the weapon&#39;s 
surface crisp and clear. Its handle on the other hand was black rubber 
and contoured for a sure grip. It was a revolver, a six-shooter by the 
looks of it, but the bevelled cylinder was drastically longer than a 
usual firearm of its type. Whatever calibre of ammunition the pistol 
took was positively not the standard handgun fare.

In addition to the pistol&#39;s elongated cylinder, its the barrel had been 
lengthened and weighted underneath with a rectangular block of metal, no 
doubt to counter the hefty mass of the rest of the gun and sufficiently 
balance it for accurate use. On the bottom edges of both sides of the 
counterweight Japanese characters had been neatly etched in ebony, 
however what it said was a mystery to Mireille. She suspected too from 
its total size and heavy appearance that the magnitude of the pistol&#39;s 
recoil had to be formidable; it would need a strong and steady hand to 
handle effectively, something Ryosuke no doubt boasted especially if his 
armoured coat was made up of metal plates.

Mireille kicked the round table in front of her over onto its side and 
immediately ducked down into a crouch behind it, its outer edge not even 
having hit the floor before she was seeking shelter from it. Barely an 
eighth of a second later a monumental boom resounded around the library 
as Ryosuke fired his unique weapon, and Mireille could have sworn she 
had felt something scrape over her head and cause her blonde hair to 
flap as she had dropped into her defensive position. Moreover, the din 
of the blast was so loud she was certain that it&#39;d had the potential to 
actually rock the study&#39;s books in their shelves and rattle the window. 
It was now of little surprise why Ryosuke had opted to use piano wire to 
dispose of his portion of guards rather than his gun. There was no 
silencer in the world that could mute his pistol&#39;s roar, not without the 
device being blown apart after a single use and unleashing the weapon&#39;s 
bellow anyway.

Looking at the deep bullet hole that had been gouged in the wall across 
from the tall gangster as a result of his wayward opening shot, Mireille 
also ascertained that Ryosuke&#39;s handgun was responsible for turning 
Ezza&#39;s face into mincemeat and for the violent evacuation of his head&#39;s 
contents. Normally telling two bullet holes apart was difficult to say 
the least, even for someone with a practiced and sharp eye reminiscent 
of Mireille&#39;s, but with Ryosuke&#39;s gun it was a lot less tricky simply 
due to its handiwork being distinctly larger than any other pistol&#39;s... 
and twin to a rifle round&#39;s. The Corsican wondered if her black-garbed 
adversary had tailored his pistol to take rifle ammunition. The evidence 
thus far did point to that conclusion.

Mireille gritted her teeth and quickly bowed her head, covering it with 
her free hand for added protection as a second boom rung out and a chunk 
of the table she was using as a shield abruptly flew over her. The chunk 
careered off towards the back wall and collided with a vase sitting on a 
stand against it, smashing the once fine and valuable ornament to 
worthless pieces. The table was obviously no match against the power of 
Ryosuke&#39;s custom pistol; while its base was made of dense wood that 
helped to keep it stationary, its actual top was light and flimsy. 
Hiding behind it was about as effective as using a sheet of paper for 
cover. It would be smart for Mireille to relocate before the gangster&#39;s 
next shot took off her head instead of another bite out of the useless 
table.

Using her free hand as a prop, Mireille rolled deftly away from the 
table at the same time a bullet from Ryosuke&#39;s gun tore straight through 
its surface in an explosion of splinters--right where the woman&#39;s lower 
back had been an instant before. Relieved to have escaped sure death for 
now, she completed her roll on her feet behind the arm of one of the 
sofas that was near the table, and then fell onto her left side, her 
Walther clasped in both hands and her countenance a picture of fierce 
concentration. Casting her eyes under the sofa and through its 
elaborately curled wooden legs, she espied Ryosuke&#39;s feet and shins just 
visible in between the front opening of his overcoat. She lined up his 
right foot in her pistol&#39;s sights without hesitation and then fired a 
handful of shots, hoping that besides his head the other parts of his 
body uncovered by his coat and clad in normal clothes were also 
vulnerable.

To Mireille&#39;s displeasure and progressively mounting concern, her 
bullets ricocheted harmlessly off Ryosuke&#39;s boots in a series of sparks, 
the sole evidence of her well-placed shots the fresh scuffs and nicks 
marking their black leather surface and adding to the myriad of others 
already present, no doubt mementos from previous gunfights. Apparently 
his boots were fortified with armoured plates like his overcoat was, and 
unfortunately they climbed high enough to protect his shins. It looked 
like headshots were the only plausible means of killing this troublesome 
foe--no easy task when considering his lightning fast reflexes and his 
readiness to draw on them to shield his face when called for.

Mireille inwardly cursed her failure to inflict any harm upon her enemy 
up to now and wiggled on her stomach behind the couch before climbing to 
her feet, her back to it. She kept low, however, rising only to a crouch 
as more gunfire--three shots to be exact--from Ryosuke came her way, the 
high calibre rounds making short work of the sofa&#39;s plush padding. 
Little bits of fluff were ejected in a spurt as each slug ripped through 
the piece of furniture from front to back, the perforating shots 
narrowing missing the blonde assassin by pure luck alone.

With Ryosuke&#39;s pistol emptied of its small load of ammunition, Mireille 
decided to take the opportunity to return fire and perhaps drive a 
bullet into his skull while doing so. She whirled around to face the 
man, peeking cautiously over the back of the sofa with her gun raised 
ahead of her. She observed the hitman standing on the other side of the 
couch shove Langonel&#39;s Manuscript inside his overcoat while he flipped 
open the cylinder of his weapon and shook out the golden expended 
casings to the floor, before replacing them one by one with rounds 
retrieved from a pocket of his coat with his then free hand. The woman 
noticed that the bullets he took out were 7.62mm NATO rounds, normally 
used in assault and sniper rifles such as the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 series 
and the NDM-86 Dragunov. The sight proved her earlier deductions as 
correct; Ryosuke indeed was firing rifle ammunition from his custom 
pistol.

As soon as Mireille popped her head out from behind the couch Ryosuke 
spun around so that his back was facing her, and covered his head with 
his left arm. The blonde fired a burst of 9mm rounds at him, aiming for 
his head, but all they struck were his bulletproof arm and high collar 
of his overcoat. Evidently not appreciating being interrupted while 
reloading his weapon, with a flick of his wrist Ryosuke slammed the 
partially replenished cylinder back into its home in the pistol and then 
reached around his body and stuck his gun past his left ribs, its barrel 
directed behind him at Mireille. The Corsican assassin whipped her head 
back behind cover--as poor as it was--and then dropped flat on the floor 
on her stomach as a series of booms resonated off the walls of the 
library, before more stuffing from the ravaged sofa drifted softly onto 
her back.

Mireille ejected the spent clip from her Walther P99 and hastened to 
replace it with a new one, envisioning that Ryosuke was doing much the 
same except a single bullet at a time. Events were not exactly ensuing 
like the woman would have preferred. She had expected Ryosuke and 
Vincent--a self-proclaimed Noir--to be challenging opponents, but this 
was tough even for someone as experienced as her. She could hear the 
cacophony of a shootout between two different models of Beretta&#39;s--one 
spitting muffled rounds, the other uninhibited--taking place in the 
right hand side of the room across from her, indicating that Kirika was 
exchanging fire with Vincent but as of yet had failed to kill him. 
Obviously Mireille&#39;s partner wasn&#39;t faring any better than her.

Mireille slid a full magazine into her pistol and pulled back the slide, 
chambering the first bullet. She then rose to her knees, preparing to 
take another stab at striking Ryosuke in the head. Hardly a minute had 
passed since the opening shot had been fired, but that had been long 
enough in her mind. If what Ryosuke had said was true not all of 
Laroque&#39;s nightshift sentries had been slain. Some of the survivors had 
to have heard the firefight currently underway in the mansion&#39;s library, 
and not to mention the sleeping members of the household too, including 
Laroque himself; Ryosuke&#39;s gun was loud enough to wake the dead, let 
alone living people slumbering in the middle of the night. Mireille had 
to eliminate the violet-eyed killer post-haste, before the situation 
deteriorated further with the arrival of the estate&#39;s guards.

******

&quot;Catch, kid!&quot; Vincent yelled the instant Mireille had stopped talking, 
hurling his switchblade in an underarm throw at Kirika.

Kirika had fired her Beretta M1934 at the precise moment she had heard 
Mireille&#39;s Walther P99 go off, the brusque sound a cue for the girl to 
commence her attack against Vincent while the blonde similarly dealt 
with his partner. So close were the two shots that they had been 
virtually indistinguishable from one another, nearly in sync.

However, in spite of this swiftness Vincent had reacted before Kirika. 
Not necessary because he had sharper or faster reflexes than her, but 
simply because his actions were unrestrained, the man following no one&#39;s 
lead. The gangster had not even bothered to wait for hostilities to be 
initiated by Mireille before he had acted with lethal intent. As soon as 
her closing words had left the blonde woman&#39;s lips, Vincent&#39;s knife had 
been flying end over end through the air, just a tiny fraction of a 
second sooner than Kirika&#39;s squeeze of her pistol&#39;s trigger. But that 
infinitesimal discrepancy was enough to alter the outcome of what should 
have been a straightforward execution.

In response to the blade sailing unerringly her way Kirika was forced to 
twist her flexible body aside to dodge it, the weapon spinning past her 
neck and lodging itself deeply in the wall behind her with a &#39;thunk&#39;. As 
a result of her instinctive evasion her aim was spoiled, but only by a 
small margin, no more than a couple of millimetres. However it was a 
sufficient amount for Vincent to take advantage of. As his right arm 
stretched outwards and tossed the switchblade from his hand, he skewed 
his body to one side, the combination of Kirika&#39;s delayed shot and 
slightly disrupted aim causing her 9mm round to skim harmlessly by his 
stomach, the bullet instead tearing a hole in his suit jacket, it 
fluttering open with his movement. In the same motion Vincent 
dexterously drew a Beretta M92F Elite from a holster strapped underneath 
his jacket with his left hand, and then fired a string of shots at 
Kirika across his body immediately after the gun had cleared its resting 
place.

Kirika dived to her right to avoid the incoming fire that instead dotted 
the back wall with a constellation of holes, and answered the rapid 
barrage with her own deluge of bullets as she soared sidelong through 
the air, her Beretta wielded solely in her right hand while the incline 
of her left limb helped to stabilise the trajectory of her near 
horizontal leap. Vincent, not to be outdone, bounded nimbly backwards 
into a dive of his own, all the while blazing wildly away with his own 
model of Beretta in a single hand, his right arm employed in an alike 
fashion to his younger assailant&#39;s left.

The two combatants had launched themselves in opposite directions and in 
disparate manners; Kirika flying a few feet above the floor on her right 
side, while Vincent travelled parallel to her on his back. 9mm slugs 
whizzed a whisker by both parties&#39; limber forms as casings rained down 
from their respective Berettas, supple muscles bending with amazing 
shows of flexibility as both contorted themselves in just the right way 
to allow a bullet to slip past them and leave their body unscathed. It 
was as if Kirika and Vincent were evenly matched, neither girl nor man 
successfully attaining an edge above the other. But then suddenly the 
deciding factor reared its head in an audible click that could be heard 
even above the commotion of the fierce duel.

The slide of Kirika&#39;s pistol snapped backwards, signifying that an 
expended clip now resided within the weapon, the once effective tool of 
murder reduced to a worthless lump of metal. Her eyes widened slightly 
and her heart skipped beat, but it wasn&#39;t out of fear, at least not 
exactly. It was more out of unease at the implications of the empty gun. 
Without the ability to return fire Kirika&#39;s life was put in greater 
jeopardy, doubly so in this aerial duel with Vincent--to be pressed onto 
purely the defensive would mean her opponent&#39;s aim was no longer 
hindered by him having to elude her shots, which consequently meant that 
the chances of her failing to dodge the subsequent bullets from him grew 
significantly. And Kirika couldn&#39;t die yet--not here, not now. To do so 
would place Mireille in abject danger, outnumbered by two skilful foes 
desiring her death--the odds of her partner surviving without her 
dedicated support were not in the blonde&#39;s favour. Kirika had an oath to 
uphold and a penance she eternally, vainly, sought to achieve. She 
wasn&#39;t allowed to die yet, nor did she want to, not while the woman she 
loved still lived. She *had* to protect Mireille.

Vincent&#39;s Beretta Elite, with its larger magazine capacity than Kirika&#39;s 
pistol, continued to fire at the suddenly defenceless girl, but as the 
hail of lead streaked towards her a strange feeling settled over her, a 
sort of... resolute calm. It was the best she could describe it--a 
gritty clarity, a resolve that told her that she would not falter, would 
not fall; it soothing her worries. It was like the feeling she had 
experienced at the Manor and more recently during the infiltration of 
the late Millet&#39;s headquarters; an unwavering confidence that she 
wouldn&#39;t let Mireille down--wouldn&#39;t let Odette down--and that no one 
could stand in the way of her honouring her pledge. However, it was 
more... refined... somehow--stronger, clearer. Not by too much, but 
enough for the change to be readily noticeable.

Kirika&#39;s widened eyes narrowed, their brown depths becoming hardened, 
determined once more. As the half a dozen bullets neared her at a 
breakneck velocity, it was as if she could actually pick them out, 
actually *see* them fly towards her, and in turn infer their upcoming 
routes through the air. She twisted and turned her lithe body this way 
and that, neatly skirting each one by at least a full inch, a 
considerably greater degree than her previous endeavours. Bullets flew 
under her, bullets flew over her, but not one of them touched her.

And then the darkhaired girl&#39;s flight waned, as did her enemy&#39;s, both 
required to end their strafing dives with their airborne duel in an 
apparent tie. As Kirika&#39;s right shoulder hit the floor she popped the 
depleted clip from her Beretta and pivoted on the joint, manoeuvring her 
body so that her redirected momentum threw her into a backwards roll. 
While she spun head over heels she plucked a new magazine from one of 
the two black ammunition pouches strapped to her left thigh and slotted 
it into her gun. An instant later Kirika was back on her feet and 
nestled in the small nook between the left most bookshelf on the right 
hand wall and the open door of the library&#39;s entrance. She then raised 
her handgun up to her face and calmly pulled back its slide with her 
free hand, setting a bullet into the weapon&#39;s chamber and preparing it 
for the next duel with Vincent.

In the meantime, Vincent finished his dive in a similar style to 
Kirika&#39;s. When his upper back touched the floor he tucked in his head 
and legs to his body and rolled backwards, ending up in a crouch behind 
an armchair near the middle of the room. Fortunately, the line of sight 
offered to him from his position of cover was not of a sufficient angle 
to see the diminutive girl, the side face of the bookshelf she was 
standing behind bestowing her with adequate--if slender--shelter.

The midair dance of death with Vincent had lasted a scarce handful of 
seconds, but from Kirika&#39;s perspective it had felt longer, as if time 
itself had slowed down, as though it had been stretched out for just 
those few moments. She wondered if the sensation had something to do 
with that other feeling she had felt. But despite the lengthened sense 
of time during the duel Kirika wasn&#39;t sure if she had managed to hit 
Vincent. She didn&#39;t believe so, however; for his dozen or more shots at 
her she had only fired six in retaliation, and she was pretty certain 
the spry gangster had succeeding in evading them all just like she had 
his. Their duel had been a draw.

&lt;Do you see now why one must not hesitate during a mission? Every second 
is precious, and talk is not to be wasted on the dead.&gt;

Yes, Kirika saw what her delay in shooting Vincent had cost her. She had 
lost the advantage she&#39;d had over him when she and Mireille had burst 
into the room, and consequently had made it much more difficult for 
herself to kill him now that he was on his guard and better armed. Yet 
the delay had been unavoidable. Kirika had behaved as guided by 
Mireille&#39;s actions, deferring to the worldlier assassin&#39;s lead and 
letting her make all of the important decisions, the girl comfortably 
knowing that her faith in her older and wiser partner was not misplaced. 
It was the method in which the pair had always operated on, and Kirika 
was not about to alter it now. She felt more at ease with Mireille 
showing her the way; it felt... right. Mireille always took the point, 
Mireille always did the talking, Mireille always made the choices. That 
was just the way it was, and Kirika was happy with that. Well, perhaps 
not so much with her love opting to be on point all the time--it was a 
hazardous position, with the woman being the first to experience any 
incoming attack--but it was probably for the best anyway since Mireille 
had to know what was ahead of them in order to make her smart decisions. 
The taciturn girl didn&#39;t feel left out or under appreciated; she was 
simply more suited to the actual combat aspect of their trade and 
Mireille was aware of that. Kirika wouldn&#39;t know the first thing to say 
or do if given her partner&#39;s role.

The unwarranted thought appropriately dismissed, Kirika refocused her 
mind on current, genuine troubles such as the two enemy assassins she 
and Mireille were trying to slay, or rather one in particular. With her 
back pressed up against its side, the lissom girl risked a peek around 
the corner of the bookshelf... and almost caught a bullet with her face.

&quot;Come on, brat!&quot; Vincent hollered in what Kirika could tell was a 
derogatory tone as he fired upon her location with his pair of Beretta 
Elites, one held in each hand. The petite assassin quickly pulled back 
her head as hot lead hammered into the old texts arranged on the 
bookshelf behind her, shredding through leather covers and aged paper 
both and likely making the tomes unreadable. &quot;Come out and play!&quot; the 
darkly dressed hitman yelled, pausing in his attack only to shout the 
taunt before firing over the back of the armchair he was using as cover 
at Kirika&#39;s position once again, slugs sporadically striking the 
bookshelf and section of wall near the library&#39;s doorway every two or 
three seconds.

Kirika, immune to Vincent&#39;s jeers--primarily because she didn&#39;t 
understand why what he was spouting was deemed as insulting or 
goading--simply ignored them for what they were to her--meaningless 
ramblings. She passed her gun from her right hand to her left, thankful 
for her ambidextrousness when using firearms gained from her smart 
decision to learn the skill after an enlightening but painful experience 
in Sicily many months ago. Her spot behind the shelf on the right side 
of the library made employing her pistol in her usual right-handed 
fashion impossible, unless she strayed from shelter which she was most 
certainly not about to do without good reason. However, due to her 
talent of being able to proficiently utilise her gun in her left hand as 
though it were sported in her right, Kirika merely had to switch grips 
rather than seek out cover more conducive to her dominant hand.

Kirika, having committed Vincent&#39;s general position behind the armchair 
on the other side of the room to memory from the earlier glances she had 
stole at him, reached across her slim waist with her left hand and poked 
the silenced barrel of her Beretta held in it around the corner edge of 
the shelf, her quick mind calculating the elevation in which to tilt the 
weapon in order to have the highest chance of hitting her target. 
Satisfied with her estimation, the girl then fired her pistol three 
times seemingly blindly at Vincent, but in her mind&#39;s eye she saw the 
scene behind the bookshelf along with the bullets&#39; predicted paths as if 
she were really peering around it.

Kirika&#39;s shots, aimed on educated reasoning alone, were rewarded with a 
surprised yelp from Vincent and an abrupt cut off to the erratic gunfire 
from his dual Berettas. The diffident but incredibly skilled assassin 
envisioned him ducking behind the armchair to take refuge from her trio 
of rounds, instead of him actually being hit by one. It was a 
possibility of course, but she knew the likelihood was remote.

With an apparent opening to go on the offensive now imparted to her by 
way of Vincent being forced to retreat from his former aggressive 
stance, Kirika whirled around and leaned out from behind the bookshelf, 
bringing up her gun and setting the armchair in its sight. She noted 
that the chair had two bullet holes defacing its intricately patterned 
fabric cushion covers near the top of its wooden frame, indicating that 
at least a pair of her blind shots had come close to their mark dwelling 
to the rear of the piece of furniture.

Kirika&#39;s foe had obviously anticipated her push for supremacy in their 
battle, and countered by sticking one of his Elites over the back of the 
armchair and firing madly yet blindly in her direction, an advanced 
tactic much like the one the girl had employed against him only seconds 
before but with a great deal less discipline. Thus, Kirika was compelled 
to dart back into cover once again to avoid the onslaught, failing to 
get off a shot of her own... not that there was anything to aim at 
besides Vincent&#39;s blazing handgun. It was a stalemate; both combatants 
trapped in their respective locales with the lone available option to 
take turns pinning the other down until one of them ran out of patience 
or ammo. Kirika was sure she could outlast the gangster in both respects 
if circumstances had been different, however as it was she was under a 
strict time frame that was fast worsening as every second passed, and 
which could end at any moment. The present environment was simply not 
favourable to a long drawn out fight.

As if to validate her point, Kirika began to detect frantic shouts 
echoing through the doorway originating from down the hallway outside 
the library, the other guards of the estate having surely heard the 
violent disturbance in this part of the house and in their investigation 
had now stumbled upon their dead comrades littering the corridor. Time 
was up. While the darkhaired girl believed she and Mireille could beat 
back any armed force that tried to enter the library--especially this 
mansion&#39;s lightly equipped and seemingly poorly skilled guards--Vincent 
and Ryosuke were still up on their feet which complicated things, 
placing the young women between two hostile fronts, one with power in 
numbers, and the other with noteworthy expertise. However, Vincent and 
Ryosuke were put in much the same problematic situation as Kirika and 
Mireille, and they had the additional motivation to escape with 
Langonel&#39;s Manuscript, stealing the book the apparent reason why they 
had invaded Albert Laroque&#39;s home. Kirika assumed that her partner would 
opt for them to chase after the fake Noir if the men attempted to flee 
as it was the wisest decision, and she knew her intelligent love was apt 
to make those.

Kirika, with her back to the bookshelf&#39;s side face, bent forwards a bit 
to check on Mireille on the other half of the room and also warn her of 
the approaching threat, while being careful not to lean out too far and 
become a clear target for Vincent who continued to send a frequent 
spattering of lead her way. She had been hearing thunderous &#39;boom&#39; 
sounds throughout her duel with Vincent, and as she cast her eyes to her 
partner&#39;s location, she discovered their source.

Ryosuke sported a big silver revolver in his right hand--of a type 
Kirika was not familiar with despite her extensive schooling on all 
kinds of firearms--and was currently occupied with blasting at a sofa 
with it. The sofa itself had endured thorough abuse, its fluffy innards 
bulging out through multiple gashes sullying its surface, akin to 
viscera threatening to spill from ruptured abdomens. And Mireille was 
pinned behind that eviscerated couch which clearly afforded her with 
limited if any protection from Ryosuke&#39;s gunfire, yet somehow the 
angelic woman was holding her own anyway. Still, the scene set Kirika&#39;s 
nerves on edge and caused a tension in her chest, the suddenly anxious 
girl having to restrain herself from immediately leaping to the blonde&#39;s 
aid and recklessly into Vincent&#39;s line of sight. Not that she wouldn&#39;t 
have despite the torrent of fire she would have had to dash through, but 
there was a simpler and less perilous way in which to relieve the 
pressure from Mireille.

&quot;Guards are coming!&quot; Kirika cried, aware that Ryosuke and Vincent as 
well as Mireille would hear her warning... and act on it.

As she had hoped, Ryosuke ceased shooting at Mireille and lifted his 
smoking pistol vertically upright, before his head snapped to the open 
library doorway, his violet gaze staying unswervingly fixed to it for a 
few moments. An alarm suddenly went off then, the appropriately timed 
piercing wails that reverberated around the house granting credence to 
Kirika&#39;s words. It was evidently enough for Ryosuke--he turned sharply 
to his shorter partner who remained crouched behind the chair, firing 
merrily away with his Berettas.

&quot;We are leaving!&quot; he informed Vincent in a harsh voice--almost a 
snarl--prompting the other man to hold his fire and look up at the 
black-garbed hitman.

&quot;Damn!&quot; Vincent vehemently complained. &quot;Just when it was getting 
interesting!&quot;

Just then the sound of footsteps reached Kirika&#39;s ears, pulling her 
attention back to the outside hallway. She saw a shadow blow past the 
crack in between the door and the doorjamb it was hinged to, and 
impulsively lashed out with a fierce kick using her right foot, striking 
the open library door in front of her and sending it swinging into a 
guard&#39;s face, the unlucky first to arrive on the scene.

The guard screamed as his unexpected assailant--the door--smashed 
unforgivingly into his face, the impact strong enough to crush his nose 
into pulp. Kirika heard him stagger backwards--likely clutching his 
ruined nose--and then she kicked the door again as it bounced off his 
face and back towards her, this time causing it to shut tight instead of 
disfiguring someone on the other side.

Kirika turned quickly away from the door and looked around the corner of 
the bookshelf, just in time to catch sight of Ryosuke bound off the desk 
at the end of the room and hurl himself through the huge window to its 
rear, the man angling his body so that his shoulder and side took the 
brunt of the collision. Glass shards and pieces of white painted frame 
fell like confetti in his wake with the whole lower half of the window 
virtually destroyed, the gaping hole creating a portal into the darkness 
of the night; a portal that Ryosuke used to vanish into its murky 
embrace.

Mireille, who had been firing round after round at Ryosuke from her spot 
on her knees stooped behind the battered couch throughout the hitman&#39;s 
race for freedom, fumed at her seemingly ineffective shots and at his 
escape, her expression incensed with brow deeply wrinkled and grinding 
teeth bared.

&quot;Later, brat! It was fun!&quot; Vincent farewelled to Kirika, flashing her a 
roguish smile over his shoulder before he followed in Ryosuke&#39;s 
footsteps, hopping atop the desk in a single leap and then diving 
headfirst through the gap in the window made by his partner&#39;s departure 
seconds before.

As Vincent jumped on the desk and dived through the air, Kirika emptied 
the remainder of her clip at him with controlled, paced pulls of her 
gun&#39;s trigger. She hoped to fatally wound him or at least cripple him 
before he disappeared from sight so that her and Mireille&#39;s imminent 
pursuit of him would be easier. There was a click of a door opening 
behind her as she fired, the telltale noise notifying her that the 
guards were about to try to enter the library again.

Kirika waited for a full second to pass so that the lead sentry had time 
to cross the threshold of the library&#39;s entrance, and then without 
looking--without even so much as thinking--her leg struck out behind her 
at a flawless horizontal angle--the slender but well-muscled limb 
perfectly perpendicular to the floor--and once more kicked the room&#39;s 
door with devastating force into a guard&#39;s face, eliciting a 
pain-wracked howl from him and delaying his and his comrades&#39; entry yet 
again. The kick was over in a flash, her foot returning to the floor so 
quickly it was as if it had never left to begin with. And all the while 
the girl&#39;s concentration remained on shooting the fleeing Vincent.

Mireille, seeing that an already busy Kirika was holding Laroque&#39;s 
guards at bay all by herself with only her leg no less, rushed to assist 
her partner. The woman threw herself along the length of the couch she 
was behind and landed on her side on the floor, the upper half of her 
body extending past the sofa&#39;s end and thus causing her eyesight and 
with it her gun sight to be in line with the library&#39;s entrance. As the 
previously booted door rebounded off the front guard&#39;s now bloodied 
features and revealed both him and his companions crowding the darkened 
corridor beyond, Mireille let loose with a series of shots at the group, 
her Walther replacing the room&#39;s door as a much more deadlier means of 
preventing the unwanted company from breaching the entryway.

Kirika could make out the screams of the dying to her rear as Mireille 
covered her back with ruthless precision, and the girl allowed herself 
to dispense with the possibility of threats coming from behind for the 
time being, having total faith that her love would keep her safe while 
her attention was elsewhere. However, her attention was not diverted for 
long. As the hollow brass coloured casing of Kirika&#39;s fourth and final 
bullet intended for Vincent tumbled to the carpet, the man himself 
disappeared into the darkness on the other side of the library&#39;s broken 
window, joining Ryosuke in shadow. She wasn&#39;t certain if her last ditch 
effort to shoot him had been successful--he hadn&#39;t exhibited any signs 
of being struck during his escape--but in the hazy, chaotic intensity of 
close quarters combat it was often hard to gauge a hit without physical 
indicators such as a cry of shock and pain, or the spreading of blood on 
clothing, or the most obvious; a sudden lifeless body collapsing to the 
floor. For all Kirika knew Vincent might have passed into the night as a 
corpse.

Kirika turned her head to Mireille on the floor as she expelled the 
empty magazine from the bottom of her Beretta&#39;s handle, quickly swapping 
it with a full one. The blonde looked up at her, after just firing the 
last round from her own weapon herself, and their eyes locked. Kirika 
could tell what her partner&#39;s wishes were before the woman even voiced 
them.

&quot;After them!&quot; Mireille shouted, sliding her body across the floor and 
back behind the cover of the sofa. And not a moment too soon. With now 
nothing to dissuade their advance or to hold them in check, the guards 
gathered outside the doorway returned the bombardment the assassin had 
used to thin out their ranks with treble the force, metallic slugs 
scouring their ragged trails in the slice of carpet where she had once 
lain.

Mireille scrambled to her feet and reloaded her pistol whilst on the 
run, Kirika matching her pace for pace on the other side of the room, 
the small lounge dividing them on their dash towards their mutual 
goal--the window and the protection of the dark. Meanwhile sentries 
poured into the room behind them like a raging flood, the riotous black 
currents spitting lead froth in their direction. Bullets whistled by 
Kirika&#39;s head and crisscrossed between her pumping legs, the guards&#39; 
abysmal aim or perhaps their fast moving target responsible for the 
misses, or maybe a blending of the two. Glancing over to Mireille, she 
saw that the woman was similarly besieged, and the shorter, slimmer girl 
worried about her continued wellbeing, that tight feeling in her chest 
waxing and waning as each round flew past her love, narrowly missing her 
slim but mature frame. Suddenly Kirika was hardly conscious that she was 
being shot at too.

&quot;Don&#39;t hit the books! Mr. Laroque will be furious!&quot; someone cautioned in 
a yell above the clamour of innumerable gunshots. Abruptly the thick 
spray of fire being delivered upon Mireille began to ebb, and Kirika 
felt her anxiety recede in tandem; the less beleaguered her love was 
with incoming bullets, the less her chest felt constricted.

As Kirika and Mireille neared the window their paths came together--the 
young women side by side once more--and each used an armchair at the end 
of the lounge as a springboard to propel themselves onto the desk in 
front of the library&#39;s window. They leapt in harmony and landed in 
harmony, their respective right feet touching the top of the desk for 
the mere fleetest of moments before they dived headlong off it, aiming 
for the hole in the window. However, during their finishing jump their 
actions differed, demonstrating Kirika and Mireille&#39;s divergent styles 
as assassins.

As Mireille passed over the windowsill, she twisted around so that she 
was gliding through the air on her back, her pistol held in the vicinity 
of her crotch. Clutching it in a grip comprising of both right and left 
hands, one to hold the weapon and one to steady it, she looked down her 
body--it near parallel to the library&#39;s floor--and along her gun&#39;s 
sight, targeting their pursuers and teaching them with a string of 
lethally accurate shots that it would be intelligent to let her and 
Kirika go without a fuss.

In the meantime, after ensuring with a quick look that neither Ryosuke 
nor Vincent were sneakily lying in wait for her and Mireille on the 
other side of the window, the more agile Kirika simply let herself 
tumble into the beginnings of a somersault, but for the notable 
disparity of omitting to bend her knees at the customary moment to 
complete the manoeuvre. As a result, she sailed through the window 
upside down with her back leading her midair trip and her legs stretched 
out, her supple form in the shape of a topsy-turvy &#39;L&#39;. Pinpointing her 
and her partner&#39;s foes effortlessly despite viewing the interior of the 
library the wrong way up, Kirika then levelled her Beretta in her 
hands--the limbs almost in line with her legs--at the guards and 
proceeded to mirror Mireille&#39;s aggressive act, doing what she had been 
trained to do for most of her young life--purge the world of sinners. 
But that was the very least of her motivations, hardly even a motivation 
at all; defending Mireille was what provoked the girl to pull the 
trigger of her gun. That sinners died as a consequence of her oath was 
just a natural happenstance. After all, only those who dwelled in 
darkness would ever try to do the woman harm.

When the remains of the window frame and the brickwork of the mansion 
surrounding it entered Kirika&#39;s field of view, she tucked in her legs 
and at last followed through with her somersault, allowing her momentum 
to push her head up and her heels down. Once her feet hit the ground she 
automatically dropped into a crouch to absorb the force of the fall from 
the first storey window as well as the leftovers of her leap&#39;s energy, 
her landing a perfect one that would make any gymnast proud.

Mireille&#39;s landing outside the library&#39;s window was not as graceful as 
Kirika&#39;s, but was still more or less a smooth one. She flew out the 
window on her back, continuing to fire at the guards through it until 
her aim was obscured by the manor&#39;s wall as gravity dragged her down. 
Her back eventually hit the ground, that wide area of her body and the 
soft grass beneath it together helping to reduce the severity of the 
impact. She then skidded along it for a second before managing to lift 
up the lower half of her body and redirect her momentum to thrust her 
into a reverse roll, which she then stopped once she was upright by 
digging her feet into the hard soil underneath the estate&#39;s lawn.

It took only an instant for Kirika and Mireille to realise that they 
were on the left flank of Laroque&#39;s mansion--the kitchen side entrance 
about twenty metres away--although it took a little longer to realise 
just where Ryosuke and Vincent were. Kirika could only see two fuzzy 
outlines getting smaller and more indistinct with every passing moment 
moving across the pitch-black compound and heading in the direction of 
the fence adjacent to the street in front of the estate. The hitmen&#39;s 
dark attire made it hard for her to follow their movements, the girl 
repeatedly losing and having to find the silhouettes again as they 
persisted in blending into the gloom, and she imagined that Mireille had 
the same problem. On top of that the young women had only just came out 
of a lit room and into total darkness; their eyes hadn&#39;t had a chance to 
adjust to the abrupt change in illumination yet. As a consequence of 
these impediments they had to endure it would make trying to shoot 
Ryosuke and Vincent most difficult indeed. But before Kirika and 
Mireille could even attempt to do so they would first have to lessen the 
wide gap separating themselves and their enemies first, as the men were 
out of range of their pistols&#39; stings.

Wasting no time, Kirika and Mireille bolted after the fleeing shadows, 
heavy gunfire from the guards swarming the smashed window nearby seeing 
them off. Fortunately, as with Ryosuke and Vincent, the dark worked to 
their benefit even without wearing black clothing, its shroud 
camouflaging their movements and effectively protecting them from the 
deadly hail.

As the assassins closed in on Ryosuke and Vincent and subsequently on 
the iron wrought fence the gangsters were running towards, Kirika heard 
shouts from the mansion now behind her and her partner, the animated 
sounds clear and easily distinguishable above the still ringing alarm 
that was, incidentally, detectable even from the outside of the 
building; the muffled shrieks of a violated and outraged creature. She 
spared a look over her shoulder at their source and witnessed more men 
dressed in black business suits spilling out of the manor&#39;s now brightly 
lit front entrance and rush into the compound. They carried flashlights 
as well as their handguns, the tools&#39; bright round beams dancing in the 
field of black blanketing the estate&#39;s grounds as their operators moved. 
Some guards circled around the house while others spread out across the 
lawn, obviously searching for the intruders that the alarm still raged 
about--or in other words, Kirika, Mireille, and their quarry. Mireille 
had been right; people who had their sleep interrupted late in the night 
did not wake up happy.

Kirika&#39;s gaze was pulled back to the sights ahead of her by the sudden 
subdued noise of Mireille&#39;s Walther P99 discharging in a rapid burst 
beside her, its muzzle flare as well as its roar contained by the 
silencer fitted to its end. Looking once again in the direction of the 
fence, the girl immediately spotted two figures scaling the enclosure, 
their black swathed forms standing out in stark effect against the light 
from the streetlamps on its opposite side. Ryosuke and Vincent had 
reached the fence, but in doing so had exposed themselves for the world 
to see... and for bullets to find.

Kirika quickly raised her weapon and joined Mireille in assailing the 
men with gunfire, squeezing off her remaining four shots without 
hesitation, knowing that the silencer attached to her own pistol would 
similarly veil its use and hence keep their position a secret from the 
angry guards&#39; eyes. But the assassins&#39; concealment would not last for 
long. Rounds from Kirika and Mireille&#39;s guns ricocheted off the bars of 
the fence while Ryosuke and Vincent nimbly climbed up them like human 
spiders, momentary but bright orange sparks igniting from each missed 
shot. If the guards hadn&#39;t already noticed the men hanging in the middle 
of the air under the glaring light of the streetlamps, the shrill noise 
of lead glancing off iron in a mini fireworks display was bound to 
attract their attention.

Both Kirika and Mireille emptied their pistols&#39; already half depleted 
magazines in a matter of seconds, and with no real results to show for 
the expenditure. They hurried to reload, their spent clips landing in 
the grass as they were cast aside and then left far behind, the young 
women continuing to run onwards. But the break in the attack was all 
Ryosuke and Vincent needed. The men finished deftly clambering up the 
spiked bars of the fence in a matter of moments and then jumped down 
from their pinnacle to the pavement on the other side of the barrier, 
before taking off down the street and disappearing behind a high hedge 
wall of a neighbouring estate, neither bothering to look back the way 
they had come.

It took a further five seconds to arrive at the fence after Ryosuke and 
Vincent had left Kirika&#39;s sight, time that was the equivalent of as many 
minutes in a chase. Kirika shoved her Beretta behind the back, held in 
the waistband of her skirt, and then leapt upon the railing, grabbing 
two bars far up their lengths so that her feet dangled just above the 
short brick wall below. With her Walther holstered Mireille leapt with 
her, although she didn&#39;t match the height of her partner&#39;s jump, instead 
clinging to a section of fence that was lower than the lithe girl&#39;s and 
utilising the top of the wall as a foothold. The duo then scrambled up 
the enclosure, the calls of Laroque&#39;s men catching sight of them 
speeding their ascent.

The nimbler Kirika reached the top of the fence first and without 
waiting for Mireille dropped down to the footpath, drawing her gun from 
the small of her back as she fell. She landed lightly on her feet facing 
in the direction Ryosuke and Vincent had fled, her fully loaded pistol 
at the ready. The darkhaired girl was glad that she was taking the point 
for once rather than her love. Wading into danger before the woman was 
something she ought to be doing, and in this scenario the danger was 
quite great. A common tactic for those being pursued was to set an 
ambush for their pursuers whenever they escaped their line of sight, and 
this situation--just like when Ryosuke and Vincent had jumped through 
the library&#39;s window--was an ideal time to put the strategy into 
practice. Kirika had to trigger any possible trap before Mireille joined 
her; that way she alone would suffer the brunt of it and as a result the 
blonde would be alerted to the peril ahead and counter for it as 
necessary, hence having a good chance of evading injury. With that goal 
in mind, Kirika ran down the street instantly after her feet hit the 
ground, hoping to tempt Ryosuke and Vincent into springing any surprise 
attack they might have planned for her and her love.

But there was no attack, for there was no Ryosuke and Vincent. Kirika 
slowed her run to a jog, then a walk, and then stopped outright on the 
footpath, panting softly while her eyes roved about her surroundings, 
searching for any sign of her and Mireille&#39;s enemies. However, all that 
the girl saw were deserted streets and silent buildings, merely the 
night itself. It was as though Ryosuke and Vincent had become part of 
that night, melting into its pall and being spirited away to places 
unknown. Or perhaps the night had simply reclaimed them, the darkness 
enveloping them, welcoming its kind home with an embrace. But either 
way, they were gone; the night would not give them up.

Mireille hopped down from the fence a mere couple of seconds after 
Kirika, choosing to make her drop to the pavement from considerably 
closer to it rather than from a ten-foot high plunge as her partner had 
done. She then ran over to the girl, her pace gradually decreasing until 
she came to a gentle halt beside her partner, her pistol lowering slowly 
to her side. Mireille was panting too from their recent physical 
exertions of sprinting and climbing, although her breaths came a bit 
heavier than Kirika&#39;s, the blonde clearly the more winded of the two.

Kirika was expecting an admonishment from Mireille for leaving her 
behind at the fence, but the woman didn&#39;t say a word as she stood beside 
her. Moments past, and then Kirika heard Mireille panting die down 
before she released one long, slow breath; a stream of cloudy air 
billowing out of her slightly parted lips past the girl&#39;s left cheek and 
rising towards the black sky before vanishing. She turned her head to 
look at Mireille and saw that she was staring at the empty and quiet 
streets in front of them, her expression gravely serious with her brow 
knitted and the muscles around her eyes tight, as though she were in 
deep thought. But Kirika knew her love wasn&#39;t really seeing the streets; 
the glaze to her blue eyes and stern set of her countenance told the 
girl that she was contemplating where to go from here now that Ryosuke 
and Vincent had escaped... with Langonel&#39;s Manuscript.

Kirika looked away from Mireille and back to the silent streets, 
starting to gaze at their tarmac roads vacantly herself. Langonel&#39;s 
Manuscript--the virtual bible of Soldats where the underlying dark 
principles of Noir&#39;s being was inscribed. She didn&#39;t know how, but she 
knew that the copy Ryosuke and Vincent had just succeeded in stealing 
was the one that she had read from at the Manor. No, she hadn&#39;t read for 
it. It had been that *other* girl--that *other* girl had flipped through 
its pages, that *other* girl had recited its passages. Kirika&#39;s *other* 
self had been the one under Altena&#39;s deceptively benevolent eye that 
night, not her.

Kirika shivered at the surfacing of memories that weren&#39;t hers, suddenly 
feeling the cold weather for the first time tonight. But then the chill 
suffusing her body slowly diminished, the girl feeling steadily warmer 
down her back and around her neck and upper chest. She smiled softly and 
looked at Mireille once more, suspecting that she was the culprit and 
was hugging her from behind in an unexpected gesture of fondness. 
However, once her gaze fell on her love she realised that Mireille 
hadn&#39;t moved a muscle since the last instance she had looked the 
blonde&#39;s way. Kirika&#39;s smile abruptly evaporated, the gentle curve 
supplanted by an impassive flat line while disappoint that her idyllic 
initial belief was proved false developed within her. But that sentiment 
was soon eclipsed as she began to feel a little disconcerted by the 
mysterious warmth, its heat almost akin to... to a presence.

But the warmth faded as quickly as it had manifested, and Kirika was 
left wondering whether it had even been there at all; if it had just 
been a figment of her imagination. Yet the cold did not seek to replace 
it, and she did not feel the bite of the freezing night air again. But 
another feeling did arise in the warmth&#39;s wake, a different one from the 
first, but one that served to rekindle her disconcert nevertheless. It 
was a feeling of having been... marked somehow. No... that she always 
had been marked, and was only now remembering. A sense of foreboding 
gripped Kirika, and although she wasn&#39;t certain of its precise origin it 
sent shudders through her soul, as if that essence knew something the 
girl it inhabited did not.

The alarm ringing in Laroque&#39;s mansion and the shouts of his armed men 
behind them urged the pair to make haste and move on, to flee into 
cover; into safety. Yet Kirika and Mireille did not budge from their 
spot on the footpath. They simply stood there, each staring into the 
night and beyond; past its swirling frozen winds, past its black 
streaking shadows, past its quiet empty atmosphere; and at things only 
they could see on the very brink of its horizon. At dark things that had 
come and gone. And at dark things yet to come.

In a flicker of shiny ebony Ryosuke darted into an alleyway swallowed by 
the darkness of the night a few blocks from Albert Laroque&#39;s residence, 
Vin tagging along after him with nearly equal alacrity. The two remained 
just inside the passageway&#39;s entrance, where the prying light from 
nearby streetlamps did not touch them yet would brand any outsider who 
ventured close to their position, their telltale shadows sketched on the 
ground before the assassins&#39; feet. Ryosuke didn&#39;t believe their pursuers 
were still following them however, but one could never be too sure. And 
those particular young women... they seemed like the tenacious type.

Vin leaned up against a wall of the alley opposite to where Ryosuke 
stood, his breathing brisk but not hard. Ryosuke knew that the triad 
member was used to running long distances at an all but constant sprint, 
with his life potentially depending on his speed--he&#39;d had plenty of 
practice back in Hong Kong. Vin had related to his Ryosuke many stories 
of his younger years spent in his birth city over the duration of their 
association, although the times when he did speak of those gruelling 
days came few and far between; often only when he was very drowsy or 
heavily inebriated was his tongue loosened.

Vin, for all his braggart ways was reluctant to reminisce on his life in 
Hong Kong, but it was to be expected; his old roots were tough, 
merciless ones indeed, even more so than usual for someone of his 
disreputable way of life. Tales of when mobs of gangsters armed with all 
manner of hand-to-hand weapons from crude clubs to wicked machetes and 
with numbers totalling in the dozens had chased him and his comrades 
through packed public streets were the norm, the mass assault the 
equivalent of an assassination attempt in his triad circles. Ryosuke was 
not unfamiliar with such brazen but brutally effective tactics, but they 
were less common in the streets of Japan and usually localised to 
uncivilised gangs of hoodlums with no affiliation to a prestigious 
yakuza clan of old. In those treacherous situations the only recourse 
was to flee on foot and find faster transport or a good hiding spot as 
fast as possible, or else wind up being bludgeoned and stabbed to death 
in the middle of the road in front of crowds of bystanders. The bonds of 
brotherhood normally joining men together with ties as strong as those 
formed with blood were regrettably made thin here, too; any companions 
who fell behind were left for the pack&#39;s bloodlust, lest you be 
swallowed by the howling horde that swarmed those unfortunates as well. 
To stay and fight was certainly to die, and attempted rescue of the 
fallen was suicidal. Sheer numbers saw to that regardless of how skilled 
one was in combat. As a result, prominent up-and-coming criminals 
learned to run quick and build up their stamina very early during their 
careers, with those who didn&#39;t more often than not having their rise in 
their syndicate&#39;s ranks cut violently short.

Ryosuke was aware that his partner had scars from his experience in the 
triads of Hong Kong, physical ones--although none that would detract 
from his &#39;beauty&#39;--as well as those of the mental kind. But everybody 
had scars in one form or another, and they were not an exclusive woe to 
those individuals who lived their lives in the underworld. Vin was 
entitled to no pity, just like nobody else was--they were all suffering 
equally. But unlike those others he had the sense not to ask for it, 
choosing instead to bear his scars in silence. An admirable trait.

Ryosuke simply stood calmly while Vin quietly huffed and puffed, the 
ex-yakuza appearing as though he hadn&#39;t dashed more than a hundred 
metres with at least twenty-five kilograms of steel weighing down his 
body just a second ago. Like his companion, Ryosuke was accustomed to 
running hard for long distances, but with the exception of being heavily 
armoured at the time. Not a drop of sweat dampened his brow nor did his 
chest rise and fall rapidly--he was perfectly composed, perfectly still, 
his body reminiscent of a statue. Reminiscent of steel.

Ryosuke had deliberately conditioned his body to tolerate all sorts of 
abuse, seeking to hone his weak flesh to match the strength of the steel 
that he wrapped it in. For steel was resilient, virtually unbreakable. 
But flesh was frail and easily damaged. To be invulnerable to all things 
he had to *become* like steel, and then the swords and arrows of the 
world would be unable to harm him. However, Ryosuke had yet to achieve 
his ambition. Tonight he had been shot countless times, and although his 
coat had protected him, he still hurt. He did not acknowledge the pain, 
of course--he had at least ascended well beyond that pathetic human 
need--but his body insisted on crying out to him in spite of his 
disregard nonetheless. Thus for now the white-haired man was required to 
don his fortified overcoat--his scales as they had once been called by 
others in the past--the black garment a substitute for flesh as steel, 
if an inferior one. But one day he would *truly* embody his old name, a 
name given to him and one another during his yakuza days--&#39;Kuroi 
Koutetsu no Ryuu&#39;. Except by then he supposed there would be no need for 
&#39;kuroi&#39;.

Ryosuke&#39;s forehead creased suddenly as he looked at Vin, his violet eyes 
that were more in their element in the shadows picking up a dark 
splotch--darker than the triad member&#39;s black coloured shirt--staining 
the shorter man&#39;s right side. &quot;You&#39;re hit,&quot; he stated simply in an 
emotionless voice.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Vin said, favouring Ryosuke with a startled look, before 
following his partner&#39;s gaze, dropping his head downwards. &quot;That little 
brat,&quot; he then said as he caught sight of the spreading blood on his 
shirt, astonishment reigning in his tone rather than anger. He prodded 
at the wound gingerly, not to see how serious it was, but more like to 
see if it was really there. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it; she actually got me. I 
didn&#39;t even feel it.&quot;

Ryosuke made no comment, merely staring at Vin&#39;s injury in 
contemplation. His brow furrowed a little deeper. Noir. His suspicions 
about Dominique having had them adopt the alias had been confirmed with 
the pair of &#39;ancient&#39; assassins showing up in Laroque&#39;s library, intent 
on slaying them. The conniving bitch had planned to use Noir to kill 
them by provoking the young women&#39;s ire with the alleged theft of their 
name. Ryosuke wondered if the infernal book he and his associate had at 
last found and acquired for Kaede--or more to be more precise, for 
Dominique--was even worth anything, or if it had simply been an excuse 
for them to be sent to Paris, the seeming home city of Noir. But that 
blonde woman of Noir had wanted it for some reason. Perhaps it was only 
valuable to her and her Japanese colleague...?

Ryosuke scowled. It would be just like Dominique to think ahead like 
that, arranging it so that Noir would be ever snapping at his and Vin&#39;s 
heels no matter if the primary objective of her plan was accomplished or 
not. If Langonel&#39;s Manuscript really was important to Europe&#39;s greatest 
contract killers, then they would likely hound Ryosuke and Vin until 
they retrieved it. And until they killed the two men for taking it in 
the first place. A very clever piece of foresight indeed, if it were 
true. But unless Noir was willing to pursue Ryosuke and his partner 
outside France, then Dominique&#39;s possible plan would be for naught; the 
ex-yakuza aimed to be out of the country by dawn. His sister&#39;s trial was 
a mere couple of days away now because of his and Vin&#39;s maddening 
overseas book-hunting errand. Ryosuke *definitely* had to have 
Yokohama&#39;s soil beneath his boots before then.

Studying Vin&#39;s wound as the man continued to spew forth his incredulity 
at being shot by the &#39;brat&#39;, Ryosuke debated whether Dominique&#39;s 
plotting was actually going to succeed in bringing about the death of at 
least one of them. It would be... troublesome to have to abandon Vin in 
Paris if he was too severely injured to travel immediately; finding a 
new partner with comparative skill to his in Yokohama would be a 
tiresome ordeal. The bonds of brotherhood were between men were strong, 
but the bond between Ryosuke and his little sister were stronger. Much 
stronger. Kaede *always* came first.

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Vin eventually declared as if sensing the concerns 
cropping up in Ryosuke&#39;s mind. He gave his wound one last experimental 
poke and raised his head to look at his companion. &quot;I think she just 
winged me.&quot; He then buttoned his suit jacket, concealing the bloodstain, 
and stared into Ryosuke&#39;s piercing violet eyes with his own amber orbs, 
their depths just as intense. &quot;I can make it,&quot; he assured the snow 
white-haired gangster firmly, knowing that his partner wanted to return 
to Japan post haste.

Ryosuke simply inclined his head in acceptance. He decided that if Vin&#39;s 
condition worsened before they reached the airport he would leave him 
behind. It would be difficult to explain a corpse sitting next to him on 
a plane if the man were to die in transit, after all, and there was no 
escape when one was thousands of feet in the air. If Vin happened to 
succumb in the street or even in the airport itself, however, Ryosuke 
was confident he could slip away and in turn mask any connection linking 
him to the dead body.

Vin gave Ryosuke a weak lopsided smile. &quot;Good. Then why don&#39;t we go pick 
up our bags?&quot; he suggested. The armoured assassin thought he detected a 
hint of relief in his voice.

As Ryosuke and Vin walked hurriedly down the streets of Paris, the 
taller man couldn&#39;t help thinking about their recent adversaries. 
Noir... they certainly were an intriguing pair of individuals. He 
wondered about their identities, about their lives here in Paris. He 
wondered how a Japanese girl had met a seeming native-born Frenchwoman, 
and how the girl had become so talented in the craft of the killer. He 
wondered how they had &#39;earned&#39; the designation of Noir, a legendary duo 
of assassins in this continent. But mainly he wondered if he had seen 
the last of them.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

Ryosuke&#39;s bulletproof coat was partially inspired by that Russian 
woman&#39;s coat in the Gun Smith Cats OAV.

For a couple of visual aids for Ryosuke&#39;s big gun, think about Vash&#39;s 
gun from Trigun, except larger. Or Barry&#39;s Magnum from the Resident Evil 
remake on the Nintendo Game Cube.

As for what Ryosuke&#39;s old name translates to... I&#39;m pretty sure you can 
all work that out yourselves. ^_^
