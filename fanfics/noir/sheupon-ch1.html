<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a>

<pre>The wild do not pity.

I sure as heck didn&#39;t feel very wild at the moment. Being tied up and 
half drugged in a cold, damp basement could do things to a person&#39;s 
confidence. Not to mention that I was weaponless and guarded by two 
thugs who eyed me like if my body was a juicy steak, ready to be 
devoured at any moment.

Shit.

Maybe Kirika did have a point with wearing so casual clothes whenever 
we went on a mission, the miniskirt and sleeveless top wasn&#39;t exactly 
helping my situation here. The poorly lit room blurred for a moment 
when I felt the effects of the drug they had used on me, it became 
harder to collect my thoughts as I closed my eyes and lay back against 
the rough wall, determined not to fall asleep. It seemed like this gang 
had fallen pretty deep since I took out their leader together with a 
bunch of their clients a few years back. They couldn&#39;t even afford a 
dose of decent sleeper judging by the crap they had shot into me, 
morphine would have worked better than this.

Maybe it had been a tad na&iuml;ve of me to believe that we could just 
settle down without any hassle after the whole mess with Soldats. They 
were still watching us from the shadows, now and then leaving a little 
reminder of their existence for what I believe, to scare us. Not that 
we really minded, since they were the ones who should be afraid. Kirika 
and I were by all their traditions and rituals Noir, officially. Not a 
title I would have raved for after learning its meaning but still, we 
were the eternal darkness, feared by even those who had created us. 

The passing months had been quiet ones, Soldats seemingly having chosen 
to leave us alone for the time being. Maybe Graipaul had meant more 
with the &#39;Good luck&#39; than he had given on, knowing that ultimately, 
they would never be able to control us. To long of tranquillity seemed 
to have it downsides besides cooking, the small matter of that I had 
other enemies seemed to have slipped my mind as we had lived our rather 
simple life. You did make a lot of enemies in this job; people have 
this annoying habit to take an assassination personally on the count of 
the assassin, while I was only getting paid for a job done. 

Someone of the gang must have recognized me on the streets and decided 
to call for a grand revenge, hence my current situation. 

I have to admit that I am a bit out of shape, I don&#39;t recall that being 
hit over the head hurt this much. We had been out for dinner after 
purchasing Kirika some new watercolours. She had become really good 
with her pencils in those few weeks which meant that she also drew her 
pictures with a obsessed frequency that would turn Dali green. I had 
been on the outside getting some air when they attacked me, two went 
down before a punch caught me in solar plexus, knocking the air out of 
me before one of them dealt me a blow over my head. The rest of my 
memories were in a blur, being hauled into a car and getting a shot, 
then the all but pleasant awakening of being here. The whole mess must 
have taken less than a minute while Kirika was off to the restrooms, my 
luck could obviously have been better. I made out the grumbling of the 
two thugs through the thick haze, my mind clearing for a few moments.

&quot;Shit, is the boss serious about killin&#39; this bitch?&quot; One of the men 
said, his breath leaving a white cloud in the chilly air as he emptied 
the last of a beer. &quot;I mean, look at her...&quot;

&quot;Hey, patience Tony. Never said anything about not touching her did 
he?&quot; I could hear the leer in his voice and fought back a wave of 
nausea. &quot;Won&#39;t be wasted, chill it &#39;til the boss gets back. I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ll get your share.&quot;

A rough hand cupped my face and forced me to look upwards, the face of 
a sombre man in his late thirties whose face was in desperate need for 
a shave and soap leered down at me. I smelled the alcohol he had been 
drinking in the sour odour of his breath, suppressing all urges to 
brash actions as he eyed me hungrily with his small, pig-like eyes. I 
really should be afraid. It may have sounded absurd to me a couple of 
years ago; the idea of an assassin that was afraid of death was 
laughable but a lot have changed in my life since then. 

I want to live. 

The clicking sound of a safety was heard, I felt something cold against 
my stomach and let out a small whimper when I realized that the man was 
shoving his gun against me, pressing it painfully against my bared skin 
while he snickered in that disgusting lustful voice. I don&#39;t want to 
die, not now when I have someone to live for.

Another wave of dizziness struck me and I lose my holding, falling back 
towards the ground while clinging to my last string of consciousness. 
There is swearing, I am lifted up again and shoved against the wall, my 
shoulders slamming painfully against the uneven stonewall while my 
aggressor is holding me by the front of my top. His other hand was all 
over my body in disgusting violation while the other man watched in 
amusement. The drug made my rage somewhat unfocused together with the 
growing feeling of sickness in my stomach.

Kirika.

I kicked out blindly, screaming like a lunatic while using my tied arms 
to push him away. My foot connected with something soft, a stream of 
angry curses followed and the man let me go.

I want to live for her, live with her.

A slap accompanied with a cry of anger snapped me out from my drugged 
stupor, the sheer force from the strike made my vision go grey. More 
screams and curses followed while the fists and kicks rained down onto 
my body. I had fallen again and was now facing the wall, curling up as 
much as I could to prevent damage to my vitals. A hard kick to my 
stomach made me scream out in unbearable pain, violent coughs rocked my 
midsection as my lungs fought to get precious air.

Religion had never been a big part of my life but I could really use 
some divine help right now. 

Who was I kidding? My only chance to survive this would be Kirika. I 
could only hope, and pray that she had been in time to see us before 
they had stuffed me in the car. The floating image of the girl&#39;s serene 
smile settled my nerves somewhat, she would be here, I would believe in 
her.

I heard the door being opened and slammed into the wall with a cold 
metallic bang, the beating stopped. Footsteps of men filled the room, 
there were two dozens of them least, all armed with handguns and a few 
of them carried steel pipes. God, my chances weren&#39;t exactly getting 
better here. A medium sized man with sloping shoulders, dressed 
sloppily in a worn out, grey suit and striped shirt stepped up closer 
to me. He gave me a sadistically amused smile and leered down, giving 
me a shove with his foot and kicked my back.

&quot;How the mighty can fall, am I right Miss Bouquet? Your confidence 
seems to have lagged compared to our last encounter.&quot; Another kick 
followed as he talked on, did he really expect me to listen in this 
condition? &quot;You know, my uncle even considered to hire you a few times. 
We could have all been good friends.&quot; I couldn&#39;t for the world remember 
his rather dull face. Great, another one of those self-proclaimed 
hot-shots, king of another molehill. 

He pulled out a gun from his pocket and toyed with it in his hands, 
releasing the magazine and reloading it. The punk was probably around 
my age judging from the voice but his skill was laughable, Kirika could 
have taken her Beretta apart, polished it and put it together again in 
the same amount of time. None of the thugs seemed to be any better 
either, the whole group consisted of street trash, first class. Even 
trash could obviously be smart thou, the drug hindered me effectively 
to put any focused thoughts or plans in action and I doubt I would have 
been able to stand straight if I had tried.

Shit.

&quot;But you just had to go and blow the old man&#39;s head off do you? Not 
that I minded, seems like none of the whores he ever banged could spurt 
a kid from his load. Leaves me the heir you know, pretty good really, 
that you took him off, spared me the hassle.&quot; He said. I was lifted 
again, this time I didn&#39;t have the strength to struggle, my whole body 
hurting after the severe beating I had received. 

&quot;I mean shit, why couldn&#39;t you have just settled for the old man? What 
fucking good was it for me to take over when you had blown all our 
regulars to hell and beyond?&quot; He lifted my arms and tied them to a 
lower pipe on the roof, forcing me to stand while he droned on, much 
like an angry child that had been snubbed of his candy.

&quot;You know what that feels like princess? To wait and wait for the old 
geezer to die and receiving nothing more than a grand piece of nothing 
and a crumbling syndicate?&quot; His hands, on my hips, I felt like 
retching. The small eyes darted down my body, scrutinizing my curves 
like a hungry wolf as he stepped closer. &quot;My, you really are a sexy 
little piece of fun aren&#39;t you?&quot; He smirked, inclining every inch of 
his lecherous intentions to me with his hands. I so wanted to kick out, 
cry, vomit, anything to get him away. His face was just in front of me 
now, hands still resting lazily around my sides as he pressed me 
against the wall with his body. Oh god, no, please...

&quot;Don&#39;t worry bitch, you&#39;re not going just yet. Me and my men will be 
with you all the way there, one and one or a couple at one time? Your 
choice.&quot; His voice literally dripping with malice and lust as his hands 
wandered. The weight of his body was becoming suffocating and I 
coughed, hopefully spitting on his clothes in the process.

&quot;It&#39;s really a crying shame you know, the red-light district would pay 
good for yo-&quot; He was interrupted when the door opened again with an ear 
shattering bang. One of the thugs who must have been standing guard 
outside stumbled in backwards and rammed into two of the men. The both 
men swore in surprise and irritation, shoving their comrade back who 
fell headfirst onto the floor in a seemingly lifeless heap.

And hell broke lose.

Five shots rang out and echoed against the walls, followed by the 
pained cries of the five unlucky men that had been closest to the door. 
They fell and sent their guns clattering to the ground, leaving the 
rest of the men in shocked stupor as they stared at their fallen 
comrades. The familiar sharp sound of a gunshot brought my senses back 
to attention again, my instincts telling me to take the moment of 
surprise to full advantage; I shoved my knee upwards, ramming the guy 
in his Oh-so-sensitive part with all my remaining strength. He cried 
out, his voice having become a lot more soprano than I thought was 
possible for the male species and fell backwards in a crouched 
position. It took me another few seconds to realize and register the 
sudden change of my situation. I was the least of their troubles now by 
the looks of it.

I doubt the low class thugs even knew what had hit them with such fatal 
efficiency as another three of them went down, one of them being the 
spoiled brat who had led them and was still on the ground when he 
suddenly let out a pained gasp. A rusty, nine inches long iron nail, 
those you often see during bridge construction or in factories pointed 
out from his neck, puncturing the larger blood veins in the neck 
perfectly. He stared at me with a look of disbelief and watched down 
the floor where his blood where spilling, oozing out from the wound 
that in a few seconds would be his bane.

A last gurgling sound escaped his throat and he fell by my feet, the 
look of horrified surprise forever etched into his unshaven face. The 
other two had been in the way for the throw, both eliminated by the 
small figure who had struck them before hey had even reacted to the 
first shots.

My lips tugged upwards in a tired, yet revealed smile at the sight of 
her. She was still in the clothes we had purchased for her this 
morning, and by the looks of them, we would have to go shopping again. 
The stylish, black pants had been ripped by the knees and were dusty 
all over; the cornflower blue blouse seemed somewhat whole together 
with her regular white jacket, if you let out the missing sleeve and 
bloodstains. The journey into this basement had apparently not been an 
easy story, her hair was even more messy than usual and she was clearly 
out of breath. The gun was balanced in one hand with refined ease while 
she held another nail in the other, droplets of red liquid dripping 
down the rusty metal.

Then, she saw me. 

Oh god, I couldn&#39;t make a nice picture. Drugged, beaten and with torn 
clothes, go figure. She opened her mouth in silent disbelief as her 
eyes wandered over my battered body. Her transformation was immediate 
as the look of relevance upon her face faded; all traces of my kind 
Kirika disappeared while time seemed to come to a halt. Her face 
contrasted as I sensed her other side wakening within. It wasn&#39;t the 
slow, almost sneaky way of usual transformation. The awakening I sensed 
now through our silent communication was like nothing I had seen 
before. If Kirika&#39;s body was a cage, then the beast within was raging. 

And she was not trying to hold it back.

Her eyes which had still held the softness of her lingering innocence 
vanished like a shadow facing the sun. Everything in her posture to the 
way she gripped her weapons changed in the momentum of an instant. The 
crushing presence of approaching death was suddenly so heavy in the 
room that it made me shudder, as much in freight as in anticipation. 
What surprised, and scared me the most was that this time, she clearly 
lacked her usual collected cool of a professional. 

The remaining thugs had somewhat recovered from the sudden death of 
their leader and were starting to move but, Kirika was faster. Her eyes 
were still resting on my limp form as she let out an enraged scream, it 
a primal sound of anger and pure rage, like a wounded beast that had 
been released. 

The first of them fell before even detecting her lighting fast 
movements. She leaped into their midst, attacking simultaneously in all 
directions with kicks and stabs, both to cripple and to kill while 
using their own weapons against them with techniques so brutal yet 
smooth that her movements became a crimson blur. A rather small man 
with a greasy looking ponytail received the full honour of Kirika&#39;s 
superb skills in martial arts when she kicked away his gun, locking her 
arms around his neck in a somersault and following it up through 
breaking his neck with a loud snap. Another man leaped at her with a 
steel pipe which she avoided with laughable ease, ramming the nail 
through his eye into his skull with an almost casual move while firing 
her gun, using the still twitching body as a shield from bullets. 

Another shot rang and I tumbled to the floor, the bullet had pierced 
the rough ropes I had been tied up in. I managed to sit up with 
whatever strength I had left, picking up the gun of one of the dead 
thugs despite that I would barely be able to do anything with it.

Kirika fired across the room, doing a perfect headshot on a man that 
had been taking aim at her. She emptied her magazine on a bearded Asian 
looking man near the exit and threw her gun away, now relying 
completely on her skills in close combat. The horrid cries from the men 
was almost deafening, it didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that they 
didn&#39;t stand a chance against her furious blood ridden rampage. Her 
moves being primal, close to feline in her deadly fervour while taking 
them down one by one in a blinding speed. Fleeing seemed hopeless as 
she was everywhere; those who tried went down even faster as she caged 
them in a battle that grew more and more desperate for every fallen 
man. 

The blood from the dozens of bodies soon soaked the rough stone floor 
in slippery pools, gun and stab wounds alike painting the dark room in 
a field of coppery crimson. More of the red liquid stained the dark 
walls as Kirika let out another snarl and stabbed a man from the back 
when he tried to flee, puncturing his lung and followed up with several 
more stabs to his vital organs before shoving him away like trash. 
Another large man aimed for her throat with a knife but was easily 
thrown into the remaining few of them with a classic jujitsu move, 
trapping a smaller comrade of his under him in a cry of anguish. Kirika 
paid their veils no heed however as she dived towards the struggling 
duo, avoiding a rain of bullets by a fraction while slitting their 
throats with the man&#39;s own knife almost systematically before leaping 
for the next enemy.

One of the thugs seemed to not have completely forgotten about me and 
made a dash in my direction with his knife raised. The tedious training 
under Uncle Claude made itself present, my self-preservation instincts 
kicked in and I raised the gun to blast his face off, focusing my mind 
to rid the nausea from my tired mind. 

I hadn&#39;t even released the safety before Kirika was upon him.

Another growl of blind fury escaped her throat as she dashed for a 
jump, the nail raised in her now bloodied hands. She landed on his 
back, knocking the air out from him with her knees, somehow avoiding a 
couple of bullets that hit the wall behind me, showering me in shards. 
I could see the cold rage clearly in her eyes; strangely, it gave me a 
secure feeling of safety. It was not the eyes of a murderous beast as 
one would believe but eyes which promised me tranquillity. Using the 
full weight and the motion of her body, she stabbed the nail into the 
back of the man&#39;s neck, breaking his backbone with a wet, cracking 
sound. He didn&#39;t even have the time to scream.

She stood over me, crouched in a ready position partly in front of me 
to provide cover from any other possible ambushers. My eyes watered 
upon the sight of her. All we had wanted was a simple life, away from 
all the pain and our past, why wouldn&#39;t god allow us that? Her clothes 
were now drenched in crimson, the sticky substance dripped down her 
arms and hands, streaks of red even covered her beautiful, yet twisted 
face. Her features were frozen in a grim look of unrestrained fury 
while she eyed the last of her enemies with an unfeeling, primal look 
of hunger. I never wanted to see her like this again, bloodied and 
stained by the countless crimes we have committed in our short lives. 
She was not meant to be like this, I refuse to believe it. 

She snatched the gun out from my hand without a word, released the 
safety and pulled the trigger, all in one smooth move that put a SWAT 
member to shame. Sending the remaining three thugs to the ground with 
continues shots in the blink of an eye; she stretched up to retrieve 
her own weapon, the last of them died in the hall, in a futile attempt 
to flee his fate.The suffocating silence that followed the last shot 
was soon followed by a hollow, metallic clang when Kirika let the iron 
nail fall to the ground. How many times had I seen this scene before? A 
girl child of barely mature age standing amidst a sea of blood, her 
innocence corrupted by greed and wicked ideals. 

And this time, for my sake.

I looked around the room; two dozen bodies or more lay on the ground in 
the sparely spacious room, practically in heaps. The smell of blood and 
gunpowder was so thick in the air that you could almost taste it. She 
had done this because of me. Tears streamed down my face when I looked 
up at her face.

&quot;Mireille.&quot; Her voice, the tuneless voice called my name, not a 
question of concern but a statement of confirmation. She kneeled beside 
me and reached out but stopped halfway, seeing the condition of her 
hands. Her other self was still dominating, merciless yet affectionate 
eyes stared at my beaten body and I saw the flicker of anger upon the 
sight of the bruises. She looked down, stopping her hands in midair 
before she spoke after a moment of hesitation. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The mumble was barely audible. My heart cried when I 
realized after a few seconds what she was apologizing for. Thinking 
that she was the one at fault, believing that this would not have 
happened if she had been there in time, it was so typical her logic to 
take the burden upon herself. The signs of the conflicting emotions 
were evident on her face even if an average person could have easily 
missed it. The somewhat strained movements of her facial muscles were 
just barely detectable for me but it was enough to be understandable. 
This side of her was still confused about showing emotions, and mostly 
didn&#39;t if not triggered.

I should be the one who is sorry. I was the one who had failed. It had 
been my ignorance which had in the start caused this whole mess, 
destroying the tiny resemblance she ever had to a normal life, even if 
it had been brief. Maybe the old sayings of this trade were indeed 
true, that an assassin could never retire. Maybe we truly are, and have 
always been trapped in the endless cycle of carnage and destruction, 
futilely believing that we even had a chance to escape. I was the one 
who had acted like a fool, failing to protect her from the endless path 
of murder out of naivety.

Ignoring the blood on her clothes, I dragged her into my arms, crying 
softly against her neck as I felt how she put her arms around me and 
hugged me back. An unsure yet strong embrace which she crushed me into 
when she was sure that I didn&#39;t mind the gore. The feelings she poured 
into this didn&#39;t go lost on me. I could feel the tiny droplets of tears 
that hit my forehead. She sobbed as her arms around me tightened even 
more to an almost choking strength. The sobs sent her petite body into 
tremors as she drew in air and dug her nails into my back.

I peeked up at her, surprised that it was still the same unemotional 
eyes but yet so different this time. Tears streamed down her face, 
making streaks among the stains of blood. The mixed look of confusion 
and surprise was saddening, like if she was unsure why she was crying 
in the first place, yet she clutched herself to me like no tomorrow.I&#39;m 
not giving up my life with this girl, never. All the old sayings can go 
to hell.Trying to mouth my thoughts into words, I opened my mouth, 
realizing just how long ago it must have been since I drank any water. 
No words came when the dizziness overtook my senses again, sending me 
reluctantly yet seductively into the awaiting darkness of sleep, and 
the inviting warmth of Kirika&#39;s arms.


***


It was dark when I came back to my senses, and warm.

A few moments of recognition relieved me when I realized that we were 
back in our apartment. Kirika must have carried me back after my black 
out, across the whole ruddy town while looking like if we had come 
straight out a horror movie. No, she must have taken the sewers, it&#39;s a 
small miracle itself that she managed to find her way.

I opened my eyes slowly, still feeling heavy headed from the sleep. The 
effects of whatever drug they had used seemed to have worn off now, I 
was still a bit sick but that was about all. Moving my head, I felt 
something soft shift under the weight of my head, the familiar presence 
behind me didn&#39;t stir at my motion. I tilted my head and looked up at 
her.She had positioned us on the bed with me taking the most of the 
space while resting my back and head against her in a rather cuddly 
way. Her own back was against the wall in a rather uncomfortable 
position while looming over me protectively, almost like a mother who 
was defending her young. One of her arms were draped over my stomach, 
holding me against her while the other hand rested at her side where 
she had placed her gun, maintained and loaded from its earlier usage by 
the looks of it.

A droplet of water fell from her hair and landed on my face, she must 
have been fresh out of the shower which couldn&#39;t have been long ago. 
Her breathing was even, almost hypnotically rhythmic as she rested in 
something like a half daze while still holding me in place, confirming 
my whereabouts on a subconscious level. Her face was still locked in a 
slight frown but it had regained its usual refined grace, no longer 
twisted in a grimace of cold, savage anger. I shuddered at the memory. 
Never had I seen her like that before. Being the most professional one 
of us, she always made killing look as easy as breathing while she took 
down targets with a brutal precision and cool unmatched by anyone but 
possibly Chloe. 

The incident today had triggered something else in her, something even 
deadlier, even if it was hard to imagine that it was possible in her 
case. The Kirika I had witnessed today had been something else, 
something with the same or even superior killing skills. A side of 
Kirika that witnessed the loss of all the unfeeling calmness she had in 
her usual act of murder. The memory of her bloody, enraged figure 
amidst the fallen bodies came unbidden to my mind and I shuddered. No, 
I didn&#39;t want to think of that.

I buried my face in the loose fitting shirt she was wearing, trying to 
flee the horrid visions in her calming presence. She smelled of lilacs 
from the new shampoo I had purchased just yesterday, plus her own 
personal fragrance that was a mix of sweat and something that reminded 
me of fresh olives. Strange as it seemed, lying like this in her arms 
always reminded of my home in Corsica. It seemed absurd that a Japanese 
girl would have any resemblance to the warm island country in southern 
Europe, even if she did smell a little like olives. Maybe it was 
because of her presence, the warm feeling of having a person who cared 
and loved you despite all your human faults, something that felt like 
more than a friend and deeper than a lover, a family. 

Yes, Kirika is my family. Even if I&#39;m not entirely sure on who had 
adopted who. Our relationship had been pretty clear in the start when I 
held the dominating role in our duo. I had solemnly decided on our 
missions, targets and methods while Kirika was something of my 
tag-along. That lasted through the whole mess with Soldats until we 
returned to Paris. The side which Soldats and Altena had desired from 
her did not, and I doubt that it will ever, disappear. Deadly and cold, 
yet strong and affectionate, the other side of my sweet artist was 
truly an enigma that more or less shot her way into my life, sending 
tsunami sized ripples through the koi-pond of my heart. 

Mind you, it is kinda hard to dominate over someone who can freeze the 
sun with a yawn. It was the only rational reason I could think of to 
explain the feeling of peace and home whenever I was with her, the both 
of her. She was my family, like the one I had had on Corsica, 
therefore, she smelled like olives...?

Dear gods, maybe there is still something stuck in my system. I 
stiffened a yawn and massaged my temples, letting out a deep sigh to 
still the tumbling thoughts. Waking in the middle of the night, effects 
from a bad sleeping drug and various injuries did not make a good and 
stable ground for deep reflections upon your life. 

&quot;You should sleep.&quot; It was a statement, not a suggestion nor an order. 
I blinked in surprise; she had still not reverted back. The slight 
monotone voice together with the familiar commanding aura surrounding 
her was never to be mistaken. 

She looked down at me with a questioning face; her tune was soft and 
heavy with the drowsiness of sleep as she shifted her back into a more 
comfortable position. I smiled to reassure her, earning me a satisfied, 
fond look aback. She moved her hand over my stomach, caressing my 
sensitive skin until she reached a part which was covered in bandages. 
There was a sting of pain but it was soon covered by the comforting 
warmth from her hand, I relished in the slow massage as her hands moved 
to my sides, working her way down my stiff muscles until I was 
completely relaxed into her embrace.

I never wanted to move again.

I let out a content sigh as I felt how she pulled a blanket over my 
body, cuddling me even closer. She draped both her arms around me in a 
firm squeeze, placing her cheek on the top of my head as she pulled her 
hand through my hair in a slow, if not seductive way. I could feel her 
breathing settle down again despite that she was not asleep. She was 
not planning to sleep before I did.

I moved my head so I could see her delicate, yet strong profile in the 
poor light from the moon. She glanced down at me, asking me in our non 
verbal way of communication if I was still not satisfied. Even if I 
hadn&#39;t minded another hour of her skilful ministrations I doubted that 
either of us was really up to it, she was hiding it well but I could 
tell that she was tired to her bones. Shaking my head in a meaning way, 
I raised my hand and touched her soft chin, knowing that she liked 
that. Very much.

I could understand why Chloe had loved this Kirika so desperately now. 
Staring up at her impressive figure from her lap, I could only awe at 
her being. A girl, no, young woman who had lived through enough 
suffering and pain in her short span of life to atone for this whole 
cursed world. Yet she remained strong, clothing herself in emotional 
apathy to survive the trials of her life but never truly losing the 
thin thread to her own humanity. Even in this state, she was still 
human and ruled by her emotions, the outburst of primal rage she had 
exhibited today was no exception. It had been her desire to save me 
that drove her to the brink, and I swore silently to myself that it 
would never have to happen again. The petite, appearing unemotional 
girl who right now held me against her protectively was indeed someone 
who deserved admiration and love more than most selfish people I had 
crossed in my life, including myself. She was probably the most 
efficient assassin in the world, cold, professional and lethally 
skilful in all the arts, someone to be admired and feared. But also, 
while behind the locked door of our apartment she was another human 
girl, affectionate, craving and passionate, starving to be loved and 
eager to give it back alike. She was a maelstrom of human extremities, 
destruction and death yet love and passion so fierce and protective 
that it put Shakespeare to shame.   

To be loved by her is like being the nexus of a storm. You could only 
awe at her wild magnificence and reveal in the safety she provided. 
Soldats would never be able to control her, and if those who claimed 
the world couldn&#39;t, who could? When I watched her like this, under the 
pale light from the moon, I was seriously in doubt that our lives would 
ever resemble something called normal. 

How do you tame darkness itself?

I admired her perfect, beautiful face. She looked like a death angel, 
sent by someone to guard me. If that was indeed true or all a 
calculation of fate, I am however, grateful. Grateful for having her 
coming and staying in my life and grateful for being the one whom her 
heart had chosen. A lone tear rolled down my chin, leaving a taste of 
salt on my lips as I closed my eyes, ready to let sleep take me anew. 

&quot;Mireille?&quot; She asked, whispering into my hair, her voice hoarse with 
stuffed emotions.

&quot;Something on your mind Kirika?&quot; I mumbled, God did I sound tired.

She didn&#39;t answer immediately, only tightening her arms around me even 
more while cuddling against my neck.

&quot;Go back to sleep, you need to rest.&quot;

&quot;Mmm, I&#39;m doing so.&quot; Peeking up at her a last time before slipping from 
reality, I gave in to the heavy weight of sleep. It wasn&#39;t like she 
would tolerate any protests from me in my current condition.

*Sleep Mireille, I will protect you.*

I know you will.

*Like I promised.*

Promised?

*Yes.* 

I wasn&#39;t conscious enough to ask about it.
