Return, Act I


Kaede&#39;s breathing came in measured, steady rasping pants as she glared 
intensely at her opponent through her veil of snow-white bangs, the long 
overhanging fringe matted to her forehead in places with light 
perspiration. The smile that was seldom absent from her countenance if 
ever was larger than usual, all but dominating her ashen face, the 
corners of her mouth pulled high into a feverish, feral grin; clenched 
teeth bared between tightly stretched lips. The slender yet solid length 
of wood she clutched in her white-bandaged hands before her creaked as 
she twisted her iron grip, lifting it slowly but surely until her fists, 
enclosed right above left around its bottom end, were in line with her 
head. A gentle curve bent the erect length of wood, the lower span where 
Kaede held it a smooth shaft of a handle, with the rest carved into the 
likeness of a katana; a delicate single-edged blade. It was a bokken; 
considered a practice weapon for the martial art kenjutsu, and for other 
Japanese sword techniques. But intended for practice or not, when 
wielded by Kaede she swung and thrust with it as if engaged in a real 
life or death duel, and struck with akin precision and ferocity, holding 
not a shred of her expertise or strength back. Restraint served to only 
blunt a warrior&#39;s skill in the long run, impressing a poisonous 
acclimatisation on the psyche to curbing blows that could generate 
hesitation in actual combat, hesitation that could spell the difference 
between glorious victory and blood-soaked defeat. It was solely 
amateurs, weaklings, or idiots who willingly handicapped themselves by 
indulging in spineless, stupid habits. Kaede vehemently believed a 
fighter should release all of their raging spirit in battle regardless 
of the circumstances behind it; to deny your spirit unmitigated 
liberation whilst in conflict of any kind was to deny your true self.

Kaede carefully shifted her stance a fraction, her bare right foot 
snaking backwards a few inches, squeaking on the immaculately scrubbed 
and polished dark wooden floorboards where not a speck of dust made its 
home. Dominique was *very* fastidious about cleanliness no matter what a 
room&#39;s purpose, even if that purpose routinely splattered rugs and 
furniture with spilt bodily fluids. There wasn&#39;t a stain that lingered 
for more than an hour after it had been made in Ishinomori Tower, and 
most suffered from an even shorter life span on the penthouse levels at 
the summit of the building where Kaede&#39;s family and the French woman 
herself took residence. Kaede&#39;s martial arts training hall where she was 
presently spending her time honing her proficiency with the sword fell 
under that latter umbrella, which was a good thing given how frequently 
she smashed this weapon rack to bits or sliced apart that wall hanging 
to ribbons during the mayhem of her practice sessions. Her blazing 
spirit once unleashed was hard to control, like a rabid beast let off 
its chain, hungry for carnage and thirsting for chaos. Fortunately, for 
all of her tsking and tutting at the sight of hacked furniture and 
scuffed floorboards, Dominique scolded Kaede light-heartedly at worst 
for her occasional frenzied destructive binges. She rarely lost her 
temper with Kaede, but when she did, it rendered the younger woman a 
weeping wreck. A cross word from Dominique could tear her open like no 
weapon existing on Earth or even forged in the Heavens could.

The shrill, curt sound of Kaede&#39;s movement filled the otherwise quiet 
training hall, and she tensed as she braced her right leg on the ball of 
her newly-positioned foot. Her eyes had stayed firmly on her sparring 
partner in front of her while she had arranged herself and thus she 
noticed his body stiffen in response to her altered stance, raising his 
bokken slightly in preparation to counter whatever she had to throw at 
him.

Kaede&#39;s opponent who she had been trading heated blows with for the 
better part of a half hour was a greying, bearded man a dash past his 
middle years, but what could be seen of his body underneath his loose 
garb of white uwagi and indigo hakama was all sinewy muscle, like the 
hard roots of an old oak tree. It was as if every ounce of fat had been 
boiled away from him, leaving behind no more than the base constituents 
of a man. Spry as he was, he could brandish a sword with the grace of a 
viper, and strike with the alacrity of one, too. Horiuchi was a kenjutsu 
master; the newest of a lengthy string who had been persuaded to further 
Kaede&#39;s already enormous understanding in the art of the sword. How he 
and his predecessors had been persuaded or even chosen the swordswoman 
hadn&#39;t a clue--Dominique saw to it all, but the instructors she arranged 
for always met Kaede&#39;s requirements... for a time. Horiuchi may have 
been as strong as aged oak and as quick as a viper, but Kaede was 
vengeance personified; implacable hatred fuelled her muscles and divine 
fury propelled her hand. And sooner of later, vengeance caught up with 
the damned... and delivered holy retribution.

Unlike Horiuchi, Kaede&#39;s clothing deviated vastly from the traditional 
dress of a kenjutsuka. A baggy white tank top and equally loose-fitting 
grey silken drawstring slacks made up her outfit, and was informal 
attire to say the least. But Kaede didn&#39;t care. She held no stock in 
tradition or customs. They were merely ornamental, superfluous; it was 
the art itself, the method of handling the blade, the method of piercing 
flesh and cleaving bone, which had bearing with her. If it did not help 
in broadening her knowledge of the raw skill, then it had no value and 
thus was cut away like a bad piece of meat. With this severe mentality 
only the choice parts survived--the all-important core. The fundamentals 
of killing with a sword.

Neither Kaede nor Horiuchi wore padding or protective gear of any kind 
over their differing garbs; this was a duel between masters, not some 
lay spar between teacher and student despite what the pair&#39;s affiliation 
may allude to. The snow-haired woman was an expert kenjutsuka in her own 
right, the gore of dozens upon dozens of slain enemies having tarnished 
the purity of her hallowed katana&#39;s delivering razor edge during her 
lifetime, followers of kenjutsu and other sword arts among them. But 
being an expert, a master, wasn&#39;t enough; she sought absolute 
perfection. She had already achieved oneness with her katana, yet still 
she strived for more, still she relentlessly pitted herself against 
fellow kenjutsu masters and their particular, sometimes unique styles, 
adapting her own to counter theirs before drawing on her new-found or 
modified techniques to crush them in single combat, forcing them to 
submit beneath her conquering wooden blade. Kaede could tolerate no 
margin separating her from perfection; she had to narrow it at all 
costs, come as close as she could to perfection with her katana if not 
actually attaining blessed perfection itself. Weakness could sneak into 
that margin at any instant for as long as she let it linger, and no 
margin was too small not to invite it. Kaede couldn&#39;t afford to be weak. 
Not now, not ever. She *had* to be strong. Strong enough to take on the 
devil-spawned ilk of Soldats. She would show them that she was not some 
gnat buzzing at their ear that would desist if swatted aside often 
enough. The ghosts of Soldats&#39; past sins had come back to haunt them; 
the spirits of the wrongfully slain were compelling Kaede to bring their 
murderer to justice. She was their vessel--a righteous avenger. She had 
to be strong... like steel.

A nervous tick suddenly developed in Kaede&#39;s right cheek, a rapid muscle 
spasm that made one corner of her wicked grin twitch erratically. Yes... 
strong, like steel. Like Big Brother. He was strong. He was the 
strongest person Kaede knew. And he never betrayed any weakness of self 
to anybody--certainly not to his enemies, but not even to his friends or 
family. Kaede wasn&#39;t as stalwart as Big Brother and doubted she ever 
would be, but she at least never openly bared weakness to any of her 
foes, or to those who could potentially become one... in other words, 
anybody who was not among her closest, most loyal circle of allies. That 
was another reason why you shouldn&#39;t ever inhibit your fighting spirit, 
why you shouldn&#39;t ever hold back. Holding back was a sign of frailty, 
that you had a crippling dearth of mettle to see things through 
completely. Kaede didn&#39;t hold back; hadn&#39;t ever. She would make Soldats 
taste the bitter tang of fear, force it down their throat, make them 
acquainted with it as though they were constant bedfellows, make Soldats 
fear&#39;s whore. No weakness would cause her to waver from her sacred 
mission. She would be strong--she *was* strong! She *had* no weaknesses! 
Kaede would drive the accursed Soldats out of Japan and all the way 
across the ocean back to their roots in Europe, with those few who 
survived the expulsion having the privilege of being put to the sword in 
their motherland, their blood watering their native soil. All the lands 
of the world would be purged of their vile presence. The vengeful 
Heavens had judged them as the most deviant of sinners, beyond 
salvation. Only eternal damnation in the pits of burning Hellfire 
awaited them. Kaede would see to it that all of Soldats met their just 
fate. They would pay! Oh, how they would *pay*!

Kaede&#39;s breathing had quickened in tempo little by little as her 
thoughts had raced, and had become heavier, deeper, her chest heaving up 
and down like a thoroughbred steed&#39;s--a warhorse&#39;s--following a fierce 
gallop into the frontlines of an awaiting army, a rank-breaking charge. 
Her pants came in louder and louder rasps while her body tightened like 
a compressing spring, the rock-hard, lean and well-toned muscles in her 
bare arms become increasingly defined with every passing moment. The 
bokken that Kaede held aloft trembled as her grip on it intensified, as 
though she were attempting to squeeze the life out of the weapon and it 
was giving its final death rattle.

All of a sudden Kaede seemed to reach a peak, a boiling point, and her 
breathing stopped dead. Her bokken ceased shaking, and her muscles 
locked. In the next instant she was surging forwards through the air 
towards Horiuchi, springing off her right foot with the ferocious roar 
of a vicious dragon leaping for the jugular of its prey, its maw open 
wide. The swordswoman knew for certain that this would be the last round 
of their duel.

Kaede&#39;s bokken flashed diagonally downwards at her adversary with enough 
force to break his neck if the blow connected, but Horiuchi had 
obviously foreseen her opening attack and matched it strength for 
strength with a countering crosswise swing of his sword, the two faux 
blades striking one another with a sharp crack. Neither bokkens budged 
more than an inch once they had joined, not even when Kaede&#39;s feet had 
hit the floor and she utilised what remained of her leap&#39;s momentum to 
throw her weight against Horiuchi&#39;s sword. Both kenjutsu masters&#39; 
unyielding arms shuddered alongside their wooden blades as they tried to 
push the other off balance, Kaede&#39;s muscles noticeably bulging with the 
effort, the cords in her neck as thick as rope and as taut as violin 
strings. Her quick breath seethed past her gritted teeth, spittle flying 
and dribbling down her chin as she stared defiantly at her opponent, 
less than a foot between their rigid faces; one harbouring untamed fury, 
the opposite a mask of determined calm.

The seconds ticked by with neither Kaede nor Horiuchi gaining the upper 
hand, their swords locked in a stalemate, until by some instinctual 
mutual agreement they broke apart, momentarily darting away from each 
other, before launching themselves headlong across the gap separating 
them to exchange blows yet again.

Horiuchi led his rush with a thrust from his bokken aimed at Kaede&#39;s 
chest, a thrust that was deftly slapped aside and safely clear of its 
target by the sneering woman with a single swipe of her own sword. Kaede 
retaliated immediately afterwards, executing a stabbing thrust herself 
but at her opponent&#39;s throat, aggressively attempting to press home the 
advantage she had gained by smacking his weapon out of the way of his 
body. However, Horiuchi&#39;s reflexes were on par with Kaede&#39;s. Almost as 
soon as his bokken was knocked away, he swung it back obliquely across 
his chest from his lower right to his upper left, intercepting the 
snow-haired woman&#39;s lunge in the nick of time and smashing her weapon up 
over her head.

Kaede managed to hang on to her bokken as it was violently bashed into 
the air above her. The hit had not come anywhere close to endangering 
the death grip she had on it, but she still spat an angry curse through 
her gnashing teeth regardless, aware of how open the parry had left her. 
Yet her sword was not her only defence. Kaede&#39;s unbridled rage was a 
shield; the potent, reckless fervour it lent her body and mind a 
stubborn if crude, brutal, form of protection. But Kaede had no aversion 
to the crude and brutal. Vengeance&#39;s fury coursed hotly through her 
veins, and the cruel ferocity it endowed her with was not meant to ever 
be tempered.

Horiuchi quickly reversed his bokken&#39;s trajectory, his sights set on the 
opening in Kaede&#39;s defences he had wrought. If his blade had been real, 
the ensuing slash would split the woman&#39;s chest from breast to navel. It 
was an obvious move, one that a kenjutsu master or a beginner would have 
struck with, foreseeing the sure end of the duel with them the clear 
victor. But Horiuchi&#39;s discipline would be his downfall. He was too 
strict in his ways, in his technique--devoid of passion. He could not 
compete with Kaede and her pious rage. He would be cut down.

Kaede reversed the arcing path of her own weapon, chopping cleanly and 
keenly downwards a mere fraction of a second after the length of wood 
had been deflected in the opposite direction, having expected her 
grizzled opponent&#39;s uninspired manoeuvre before he had even altered his 
sword&#39;s position to commence the sloping finishing stroke. There wasn&#39;t 
any means to block Horiuchi&#39;s incoming attack, but Kaede wasn&#39;t looking 
to. Her bokken&#39;s swing came behind her confident adversary&#39;s, yet it was 
the one that counted. Kaede heaped all of her strength into the slice, 
all of her avenging power, which equated to thrice what Horiuchi had put 
into his. Consequently, when her slashing bokken linked with the greying 
man&#39;s from the rear and their momentum was pooled, stacked behind the 
latter kenjutsu master&#39;s sword, it was *she* who controlled its stroke.

Horiuchi grunted as wood shoved wood with indomitable brute force, 
whether in shock, alarm, or because of the impact of the hard blow 
itself, Kaede wasn&#39;t sure. In truth she barely registered the grainy 
rumbling emitted from his throat, her mind clouded by the heavy red haze 
of burning anger, the lone parting through the fog a roiling tunnel that 
only channelled thoughts about seizing revenge for past defeats beneath 
Horiuchi&#39;s tutoring sword... a revenge within reach.

Kaede exercised her dominance over Horiuchi&#39;s swing to viciously hobble 
its range, literally cutting the slice short with the deft and 
compelling cleave of her bokken so that his once sure finishing blow 
missed her by a hair&#39;s breadth. But a miss was still a miss by whatever 
distance irrespective of how slim, and thus it was more than enough to 
turn the tables in the snow-haired woman&#39;s favour, enough to transform 
Horiuchi&#39;s certain triumph into certain doom.

Kaede&#39;s sword pressed her opponent&#39;s downward until the latter&#39;s tip was 
scratching the varnish off the floorboards, and then she held his bokken 
steady there beneath her own imitation blade, trapping it. Consequently 
she couldn&#39;t bring her weapon to bear against him and put an end to this 
duel without releasing his, but a kenjutsu master did not rely solely on 
their sword. Or at least a master of Kaede&#39;s calibre did not. If 
separated from her katana she was still very capable at defending 
herself and at neutralising aggressors--permanently. Her katana was just 
an extension of herself; both she and it were weapons, two weapons that 
could forge a partnership together and become one--a combination that 
was devastating. Kaede&#39;s sword had done all it could now. It was left to 
her to finish the task.

Horiuchi&#39;s eyes dropped for a split second to his and Kaede&#39;s crossed 
and wedged bokkens, their depths for once showing a glimmer of 
distress--a glimmer that flared to utter panic once he lifted his 
attention back to his foe and saw the young swordswoman&#39;s snarling face 
converge rapidly on his stunned own. Kaede&#39;s forehead struck like a 
battering ram against Horiuchi&#39;s face as she decisively head-butted him, 
and with an audible crunch of shattering cartilage and an eruption of 
bursting blood vessels, his nose was pulverised into a satisfying red 
and black pulp.

To his credit, Horiuchi did not scream in unchecked anguish as most 
would upon suffering the grievous though essentially superficial injury, 
but he did make a gruff grumble of pain and reel back a step, his 
clearly dazed head bobbing and lolling indolently on his shoulders as if 
attached to his body by a spring. Before he could recover his senses or 
recoil further, Kaede reared back her head--her fringe of formerly pure 
white hair now generously speckled with dark, clotted blood--and 
delivered a second crushing impact with her hard skull against 
Horiuchi&#39;s gore-splattered visage.

This subsequent blow so soon after the first proved too much for the old 
kenjutsu master and he lurched back a few more steps, his arms dangling 
stiffly by his sides with his bokken held limply and seemingly forgotten 
in his left hand. Horiuchi&#39;s ruined nose streamed blood down to his chin 
like a thickly flowing river and coloured his grey moustache and beard 
scarlet. His eyes were scrunched in abject agony, his tortured face a 
web of wrinkles previously unseen. He was aged oak tasting the bite of 
the woodcutter&#39;s axe and on the brink of toppling. Cracks had appeared 
in his spirit and were splintering then spreading like wildfire; just 
one more hit and it would break, one more chop and aged oak would be 
felled.

And chop Kaede did. With splashed blood now streaking the middle of her 
face to be a near match to Horiuchi&#39;s, Kaede hoisted her bokken in her 
two hands up into the air beside her head, adopting the same stance she 
had before at the beginning of this duel&#39;s final round, and then swung 
the length of wood at her swaying adversary&#39;s temple. The faux blade 
struck its target unopposed while Horiuchi floated in his stupor, the 
clean hit punctuated by a dull thud. The grizzled man&#39;s head snapped 
violently to the side before prompting jerking the rest of his body 
along with it, the kenjutsu master spinning around before crumpling 
heavily onto his forearms and knees, subjugated at Kaede&#39;s feet, his 
bokken whirling away from his limp hand across the floor.

Horiuchi moved feebly, crawling on all fours like a whipped, pathetic 
dog with its tail between its legs and its head bowed, the once imposing 
and dignified kenjutsu master brought low to his rightful place 
kneeling, cowed, before an invincible, self-assured Kaede. She towered 
over him in her proven superiority while blood dripped profusely from 
his broken nose and dotted the floor in a quickly amassing puddle, his 
bloodied and bruised face illustrating her victory over him; her 
dominance. But their duel was not done. Horiuchi was bested, yes, but 
his lesson had not been fully learnt yet. Now Kaede was the teacher, and 
Horiuchi&#39;s lesson had to be hammered home so he would not forget it. He 
had to *recognise* that his rightful place was prostrate beneath her, 
that her triumph over him today was a product of her outstanding skill 
and not of mere luck, and that the same result would transpire any other 
day from now on if he ever challenged her to cross swords again, seeking 
to regain his lost honour. He had to accept that Kaede was his better, 
that her blade cut swifter and cut deeper than his--that she was the 
greater sword master. Because she *was*. Because his rightful place 
*was* beneath her, because she *would* triumph over him again in battle. 
So that he would remember those truths, so that they would be imprinted 
permanently on his mind, his defeat had to be devastating. *Crippling*.

Stepping nimbly around her fallen opponent on the balls of two light, 
dancing feet, Kaede threw her bokken out to the side in her right hand, 
and then without hesitation or mercy, brought it crashing down on the 
back of Horiuchi&#39;s head, on the tender spot where the base of his skull 
connected with his vertebrae. She made no effort to moderate her coup de 
grace despite the aged man&#39;s all but conquered condition, concentrating 
all of the ferocity that surged within her turbulent spirit into the 
potentially paralysing blow. Such was the ferocity&#39;s strength that 
Kaede&#39;s bokken exploded on contact with Horiuchi&#39;s drooped head in a 
shower of wooden shards, half of a coarsely splintered carved blade 
spiralling off to clatter in some far corner of the training hall.

The loud crunching snap of Kaede&#39;s bokken fracturing asunder echoing off 
the walls heralded the conclusion of the duel, Horiuchi succumbing to 
the comforts of unconsciousness upon having his head used to split the 
sturdy weapon crudely apart. The kenjutsu master instantly slumped flat 
onto his stomach as if someone had suddenly exchanged the muscles in his 
supporting arms and legs for water, his cheek hitting the hard 
floorboards with a slap and his tortured face settling into the 
expression of an uneasy sleep. A bloody paste of a tint verging on black 
matted his formerly shaggy hair, the thick grey covering seeming to have 
done little if anything to cushion the punishing impact of Kaede&#39;s 
sword. Needles of wood varying in size and shape were knotted in the 
sticky tangle of blood and hair, and more littered the back of 
Horiuchi&#39;s white gi and were scattered haphazardly atop the floorboards 
surrounding him. Horiuchi uttered not a sound, not now in his slumber or 
before when he had been ruthlessly bludgeoned. Whether his neck was 
broken or not, Kaede couldn&#39;t tell. She mused that he might not even be 
sleeping; he could be dead, his body now a vacant husk and his soul 
already on its last and most important journey. His slumber could be the 
sacrosanct one that all women and men must one day yield to, the one 
that wrenched the soul from the earthbound shell and ushered it towards 
final judgement where its ultimate fate was carefully weighed and then 
decided by the Gods--saint or sinner, the Heavens or Hell.

Whatever the case, it was beyond Kaede&#39;s concern now, although she would 
feel no pity if Horiuchi was dead. Honour would be more like it. 
Delivering a soul into Death&#39;s waiting hands to be carried away for 
judgement was something to be venerated, more so if that soul were 
immaculate. Slaying sinners was a duty, but slaying saints was an 
honour. Kaede could not distinguish for certain which Horiuchi was--or 
had been--but she believed she had seen the good in his unblinking 
steely gaze underneath the cloud of discipline that had obscured it. If 
he were dead, then he would be welcomed with open arms in the Heavens.

Kaede stared down at her vanquished sparring partner as she stood over 
him imperiously. Gradually her arms lowered to her sides and her severe 
grip on the remains of her bokken slackened. Her heaving chest softened 
its swells and their frequency diminished, the heart that had once 
thumped maniacally there mellowing to an easier rhythm. In tandem her 
hot blood calmed its crazed gush through her veins, its spur no longer 
quite so adamant. The red haze that pervaded her mind thinned and then 
cleared, taking with it the heat from her temper, cooling it to a low, 
edgy simmer. It felt as though her skin was on fire, that its pallid 
complexion should instead be a bright red, flushed, with rising steam 
hissing from every pore. Her sweat was abruptly chilling to her body and 
she was made very much aware of it trickling down the middle of her back 
and sliding past her temples. The young woman had an urge to shiver and 
even hug herself; such was the loss of warmth.

Kaede&#39;s spirit was receding within her, withdrawing its influence over 
her heart, mind, and body; the beast retreating and becoming caged and 
muzzled once again. With its exodus and restraint Kaede felt weaker, the 
strength fading from her limbs and her body suddenly feeling more 
sluggish and ungainly. Her fiendish, manic grin shrank in intensity too, 
and in width, dwindling from a frenzied rictus to her usual smirk. It 
had been as if Kaede&#39;s feral fighting spirit had possessed her face to 
convey its tempestuous, murderous rage in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the beast 
contorting her visage to mirror its own and spit its vehemence. But it 
was exorcised now, as was the rest of her spirit&#39;s sway over her. The 
duel was done. Vengeance had been dealt.

&quot;There is nothing more you can teach me,&quot; Kaede said to Horiuchi&#39;s prone 
and unresponsive form, undeterred by the latter. &quot;Begone.&quot; She tossed 
the stump of her shattered wooden sword unceremoniously on her former 
tutor&#39;s back, the latest of many who had met similar fates, and then 
crisply turned and walked coolly away.

With Kaede&#39;s dismissal of Horiuchi by word and by sight, the two women 
who had up until then been mutely standing adjacent to the walls at 
relaxed attention opposite each other in the rear half of the training 
hall, abruptly left their posts and advanced on the lifeless kenjutsu 
master, as if new life had been shot into their previously idle bodies. 
The pair was smartly dressed in trendy black business suits that clearly 
once had had expensive price tags attached to them, and both their 
outfits were cut in identical styles, albeit for the difference of 
slacks on one and a straight skirt that ended just above the knees on 
the other. The short thick heels of their black leather shoes clicked on 
the polished floorboards as they walked, their stride and posture 
exuding poise and pride, and the silver pins on the left lapels of their 
jackets flashed under the lights of the room. Up close, those small 
round badges portrayed two kneeling young women swathed in robes, facing 
each other, and bearing double-edged swords of European origin in their 
hands. It was an ancient emblem--or so Dominique had claimed when Kaede 
had pressed her on the subject--and one that was apparently still in use 
today... by the hated enemy, Soldats. However, purportedly that use was 
rare and grudging at best, owing to the shame those of Soldats felt from 
turning away from the true purpose of their secret society, of forsaking 
their true dogma ratified over a thousand years ago when the world was 
tearing itself apart. Now, Dominique had said, she used it as a symbol 
of Soldats&#39; roots, of Soldats&#39; ancestors come back to punish their 
wayward kin. Those who wore the pin were unshakably loyal to the Soldats 
of old, and totally committed to overthrowing the fetid Soldats of 
present day.

But what Kaede saw when she espied a silver pin on a black collar or 
lapel was a lot simpler than what Dominique invested in the insignia. To 
Kaede, those badges and dark suits marked out those of her faction who 
were the most reliable and trustworthy, and the most capable--her elite 
soldiers. They were like Dominique, in that they had all seen the light 
and had defected from Soldats, sharing the same conviction as the French 
woman&#39;s; that Soldats was a sinful organisation needing to be purified 
by fire and sword. Consequently all of Kaede&#39;s elite soldiers lived up 
to the title. They were Soldats trained, making them the equivalent of a 
Special Forces military platoon where each member had diverse 
abilities--some were excellent tacticians and outstanding commanders, 
others flawless snipers and experts at evading notice, several were 
masters of unarmed combat and explosive wizards; the assortments were as 
plentiful as they were varied, skills from every walk of life wielded by 
people just as divergent. There were even a few historians and fencers; 
a couple of the second had invited themselves into Kaede&#39;s training hall 
to watch her practice her kenjutsu forms once, muttering between 
themselves in a foreign tongue while scrutinising her katana&#39;s strokes 
intently.

Strangely, every last person that made up Kaede&#39;s elite detachment was 
female. But when considering that Dominique supervised the division and 
screened every new defector wishing to enlist with the utmost diligence 
to weed out possible Soldats spies trying to infiltrate their ranks, it 
was not that surprising. Dominique did have a low opinion of men that 
was quite widely known, and even though Kaede had never seen her being 
intimate with anybody, the snow-haired woman suspected her personal 
assistant&#39;s taste in romantic companionship ran alike with hers, 
favouring the female persuasion. There was the possibility that 
Dominique was just a complete prude, but Kaede found that notion highly 
dubious with a Parisian woman like Dominique who emanated elegant 
sensuality from every fibre of her being no matter what the 
circumstances. Perhaps she was merely picky, or married to their mission 
of retribution. In any case, Kaede sincerely doubted she would ever see 
a man sporting the illustrious silver pin on his clothes.

While they were elite soldiers, the women converging briskly and 
portentously on Horiuchi also held a mantle that was greater than that. 
They currently belonged to Kaede&#39;s personal bodyguard, a shadowing 
quartet that had been appointed to serve and protect her by a concerned 
Dominique at the commencement of their crusade against the scourge that 
was Soldats. Trusting the young woman&#39;s welfare only to those whose 
loyalty to their cause and whose competency fulfilling the imperative 
task were above question, Dominique had decreed that the elite 
detachment&#39;s primary role was to always safeguard Kaede&#39;s life first and 
foremost beyond any other duty they might additionally be bundled with. 
But to make absolutely certain that she was being continuously looked 
after rather than merely in passing, the French national had ordered 
that at least four members of the elite Soldats renegade branch must 
accompany Kaede at all hours of the day and night regardless of what the 
snow-haired woman was doing, the sole exception being when she retired 
to her quarters where they instead stood vigilant outside her door to 
allow their charge her privacy.

It was all too much in Kaede&#39;s opinion. She was not some delicate damsel 
needing to be coddled; she was a battle-hardened warrior with the spirit 
of vengeance on her side. Even so, Dominique had shooed away her 
protests about being babied, and four was the lowest sum of guards the 
young woman had been able to talk her overprotective assistant down to. 
Kaede reluctantly confessed that despite her objections she was fairly 
fond of Dominique&#39;s doting, but she wished the older woman would give 
her a little more credit. It didn&#39;t help that Big Brother behaved much 
the same, habitually having their old yakuza friends quietly tail her or 
escort her under the guise of keeping her company. Both Dominique and 
Big Brother knew what she was capable of and that she had been chosen to 
be an avenger; why did they persist pampering her? None of the guards 
they allotted to watch over her could even come near to matching her 
power. They were like wolves defending a dragon.

Kaede picked up soft breathy grunts of exertion behind her as her two 
dark clad protectors, unconcerned whether he had spinal damage or not, 
seized Horuichi by the arms and roughly hauled his face from the floor, 
the rest of his rag doll body closely following suit. His sagging, 
floppy bare feet squeaked against the wooden floorboards, skidding along 
in tow behind him like dead weights as the duo dragged him off to the 
training hall&#39;s side door at the back of the room to see him disposed 
of. What that entailed precisely Kaede wasn&#39;t wise to and hadn&#39;t 
bothered enough to remedy that deficiency. Whatever happened to her 
ex-kenjutsu tutors, suffice to say that after they were bodily removed 
from her training hall she never had another opportunity to lay eyes on 
them again.

Not deigning to so much as glance over her shoulder at the activity 
taking place behind her, Kaede continued to stroll towards the front of 
the hall unperturbed. The pitter-patter of lively clapping coincided 
with her approaching footsteps, its source the small group of women 
gathered near the training hall&#39;s front entrance ahead of her. One of 
their number was another of Kaede&#39;s bodyguard, set a little but obvious 
distance apart from the other two women where she leaned casually with 
her back against the wall next to the room&#39;s double doors. Her arms were 
folded below her breasts and her head was lowered, her eyes hidden 
behind the lenses of jet-black sunglasses, giving the erroneous and 
potentially fatal impression that she was asleep on her feet and 
oblivious to her surroundings. She was a foreigner, as were the two 
guards lugging Horiuchi off to the unknown behind Kaede and the fourth 
and final sentry of the quartet standing watch outside the room&#39;s 
entrance. Three quarters of the elite Soldats deserters under Kaede&#39;s 
flag hailed from overseas, representing ethnicities from all across the 
globe. Approximately half that called countries in western Europe home 
like their colleague Dominique; France, Spain, Germany, and Italy 
standing out as the prevailing native lands. Never before had Ishinomori 
Tower been so bustling with foreigners. But Kaede bore no prejudices 
against her non-Japanese allies; they were all comrades-in-arms, united 
for a singular righteous purpose. It was a glorious thing.

The applauding tapered off as Kaede joined the other two women of the 
group; the one responsible for the ovation stepping keenly forwards to 
meet her. Like the members of Kaede&#39;s bodyguard, the woman in question 
was born outside of Japan, yet her distinctly oriental attire certainly 
suggested the contrary. A voluminous yukata complete with obi hung from 
her bare creamy shoulders, scarcely clinging as though just a touch 
would send the garment sliding entirely off her body to puddle about her 
feet clad in white tabi socks and zori sandals. Kaede knew the obi 
wrapped securely around the woman&#39;s midriff would prevent such a 
calamity from happening--indeed, it was probably the only thing barring 
the yukata&#39;s shameless descent to the floor--but without it she would 
have been risking a sudden total exposure of her feminine beauty at any 
moment she so much as breathed too hard. While the brazen arrangement of 
her clothing revealed a wide &#39;V&#39; of beguiling cleavage deep enough to 
swallow anyone&#39;s gaze, what it didn&#39;t reveal was that beyond the woman&#39;s 
shoulders, upper chest, and the narrow valley between her luscious and 
ample twin swells, she was just as naked underneath the yukata&#39;s folds. 
Kaede was one of very few and select people who was privy to the private 
personal detail; after all, Claire regularly dressed and undressed in 
front of her, the latter normally to bare her body and all of its 
exquisite treasures to the snow-haired woman. Kaede was intimately 
familiar with every inch of that alluring form concealed and unconcealed 
by the enveloping yukata, and not only by sight but by touch and taste 
as well. Claire was her whore.

In truth, Claire could really be called Kaede&#39;s concubine instead of 
being labelled a mere common tramp. She diligently tended to all of her 
mistress&#39;s personal needs like washing and drying her, dressing and 
undressing her, and seeing to her general comfort as if she was a body 
servant... although she was more of a servant to Kaede&#39;s body than other 
help typically was. As Claire&#39;s title implied, in addition to ensuring 
that her mistress&#39;s daily needs were catered to, another of her 
responsibilities was to gratify Kaede&#39;s... other, even *more* personal 
needs. To Kaede&#39;s chagrin, the pleasures of the flesh were a vice she 
had considerable trouble denying, a weakness she realised, but one that 
even her indomitable will could not withstand. However, she admitted she 
didn&#39;t really try that hard to resist her desires that frequently led 
her to find succour in the arms of other women. Favoured by the gods she 
was, but Kaede was still human with a few yet to be conquered human 
frailties... some more tolerable than others. Besides, her weakness for 
female bedfellows was innocuous and taken care of by her concubines; it 
wasn&#39;t as though it put Kaede&#39;s campaign against Soldats in jeopardy.

Claire stood a couple of inches taller than Kaede, and her loose-fitting 
yukata couldn&#39;t hide a build that was rather petite, the obi emphasising 
a waist that was even smaller than her mistress&#39;s already slender own. 
Her slightly diminutive physique was hindered by a quite impressive 
muscle tone however, along with curves verging on voluptuous for her 
figure made more so by her tiny waist, her chest in particular 
prominent. Dark red hair akin to the colour of a ripe cherry, red wine, 
or congealed blood, fell in several plump and untidy spiralling ringlets 
to roughly a hand&#39;s breadth past Claire&#39;s shoulders, the two shortest 
framing a cute angelic or impish face--however one wanted to look at 
it--that seemed to never be long without a tickled smile upon it. A few 
stray bangs jutting out from the top of her head where the tapering 
ringlets began their swirls hung over eyes a duller shade of red, almost 
a subdued orangey-brown like a pair of unpolished garnets. Yet despite 
their tint Claire&#39;s eyes had a naughtiness about them to go with her 
mischievous face. And naughty Claire could certainly be if her playful 
antics around Kaede, explicitly whist in her bedroom, were any judge. 
But there was something else Kaede occasionally glimpsed in her eyes... 
something that emphasised the imp in her--the demon inside--her roots as 
a sinner. Depravity of the body was Claire&#39;s obvious sin, but this demon 
espied was of a different variety. Strange... but it could just be a 
figment of Kaede&#39;s imagination. Dominique had done all of the arranging 
of the woman&#39;s &#39;services&#39; and had sworn to her that Claire was of the 
faithful. Kaede&#39;s guardian would not see a snake share her bed.

Her adorable countenance made Claire appear young, and at a casual 
glance one could mistake her for a girl in her late teens. Like her 
perceived innocence, her real age slanted more towards the opposite end 
of the spectrum. Claire was in fact older than Kaede, in her early 
thirties, although her exact age was a mystery to the snow-haired woman. 
Claire had been warming her bed for a couple of months now, yet many 
things about the woman still were to Kaede; her race, her probably 
debauched background, even her family name. They were details she could 
easily find out by talking to Dominique, but she had no interest in 
them. She was not looking to be Claire&#39;s friend, nor did she wish for 
the woman to be hers. Claire&#39;s purpose was to perform as her concubine; 
to fulfil the function she was allotted. So long as her finer points did 
not intrude upon that duty or any of the other personnel&#39;s in Ishinomori 
Tower, they were irrelevant.

In her spare moments spent in Claire&#39;s company, Kaede sometimes did idly 
speculate on where her concubine was from, however. Her facial features 
marked her clearly as a westerner, as did her odd wielding of the 
Japanese language, the pronunciation of numerous words peculiar to 
Kaede&#39;s ears. Kaede sometimes imagined that Claire was European, 
although she had no concrete basis for that presumption besides that 
most of the foreigners packing Ishinomori Tower&#39;s halls came from that 
continent. She did however recall hearing the redhead mutter things 
under her breath in English every so often, too low to actually decipher 
but with recognisable heat, and thus the possibility that Claire 
originated from an English-speaking country had crossed the kenjutsu 
master&#39;s mind. Nonetheless, at the end of the day Kaede&#39;s ponderings 
were moot and remained what they always had been--idle.

Claire&#39;s fat coils of ruby-red hair corkscrewing their way down from her 
head were striking, but it was the garish and graphic yukatas she wore 
that first drew the eye. Apparently having a penchant for traditional 
Japanese culture--or at least for the fashion at any rate--Claire was 
nary seen outside of Kaede&#39;s quarters lacking a yukata on the verge of 
slipping from her shoulders, each one as extravagant and lurid as its 
predecessor. Red was forever a prevalent colour, although the shades did 
change, and the yukatas&#39; rich decorations encompassed every available 
square inch of fabric--often even the obi was involved. Subtle designs 
in the vein of a handful of falling cherry blossoms or a pair of birds 
in flight were notably absent in favour of sprawling hectic scenes 
featuring conflict of some kind; order versus chaos a principal theme. 
Today Claire&#39;s yukata told the tale of a fierce battle waged between 
ancient fully armoured samurai brandishing katanas and the sporadic 
wakizashi, and burly malevolent oni of many sorts and shapes grinning 
wickedly while their fangs and talons put their enemies&#39; defences to the 
test. The yukata depicted a struggle unresolved, neither samurai nor oni 
giving the impression of having the upper hand, or that they would gain 
it anytime soon. It was another customary theme of all of Claire&#39;s 
yukata pictorials; eternal stalemates between two opposing sides, the 
combatants locked in a war without end.

The broad, deep sleeves of Claire&#39;s yukata flapped amid her quick 
movement towards Kaede, a samurai with raised sword bristling and a 
horned oni&#39;s bulging muscles flexing. A cheery smile brightened her 
pretty face and washed a further five years from her youthful veneer, 
the beam for her mistress just as sycophantic as the clapping had been.

&quot;A splendid performance,&quot; Claire praised, adding predictable verbal 
accolades to her ingratiating routine at the same time she intercepted 
Kaede&#39;s march, positioning herself to block the swordswoman&#39;s path. &quot;But 
one to be expected from a warrior of your calibre! Your expertise with a 
blade has been evinced to be unparalleled yet again.&quot;

Kaede, unfazed by the obsequious behaviour, did not slow her stride and 
pressed onwards, Claire swinging her body aside smoothly to make way yet 
not missing a beat with her fawning talk. The head of the Ishinomori 
family expected to be treated with a healthy dose of deference from her 
underlings, but Claire&#39;s toadying every so often bordered on 
patronising, her tone cavorting dangerously close to sarcastic. It was a 
very subtle bordering, but the objectionable trace of rebelliousness was 
there. The conduct was not considered by the kenjutsuka to be befitting 
in a subordinate, and rendered worse when that subordinate satisfied a 
function as intimate as the one Claire did. Kaede contemplated that she 
might have to put her sometimes disrespectful concubine firmly in her 
place someday--strict, defining discipline that the younger woman 
contemplated she possibly should have administered at the very beginning 
of their relationship--teaching her that her mistress was not ignorant 
to her condescending attitude, and that her position in the kenjutsu 
master&#39;s life did not impart her any leniency from her stern and 
punishing hand.

Walking past Claire, Kaede came to a stop a short distance behind the 
redhead, standing in front of the last woman of the little group loosely 
assembled in the vicinity of the training hall&#39;s chrome main entrance. 
The woman was the most subdued of all of the room&#39;s occupants--other 
than Horiuchi, of course--but in a very different manner to the nearby 
guard&#39;s relaxed alertness. Like the guard her head was lowered, but a 
cowed gaze was settled uneasily on the floor, sunken eyes rimmed below 
with dusky shadows numbly staring. The subjugated atmosphere smothering 
her was thick, heavy and oppressive; her bowed head, her hunched 
shoulders, her broken and deadened stare; all contributed to paint a 
bleak portrait of defeat and desolation, human misery at its deepest and 
darkest. She was how a servant was supposed to be: submissive and quiet. 
And a servant she was. Fumiko Morita had been serving Kaede for a long 
time, benefiting from several years of precision sculpting courtesy of 
her mistress that was responsible for shaping her into the painfully shy 
and subservient being she was today.

Fumiko was a young woman around Kaede&#39;s age, comparable enough to have 
potentially been her classmate in high school back in the day, and 
reached about her height as well, standing virtually at eye-level with 
her mistress. But where Kaede&#39;s slender physique had been toned to a 
trim muscular thanks to her life of martial pursuits, Fumiko&#39;s slender 
form was just that--slender. While she was not bony by any means, she 
was quite lean, missing the well-rounded curves and generous bust of 
Claire. But that was not to say she was any less ravishing in her own 
fashion, or that she was bereft of shapely feminine lures, lures that 
Kaede most certainly enjoyed in as many ways as they could be enjoyed.

Fumiko was not second to her counterpart Claire in looks, either. She 
was tremendously pretty, blessed with a wholesome beauty like that of a 
fresh-faced country girl. Her pallid, sickly complexion of a hue that 
rivalled Kaede&#39;s pale own and her worn-out and miserable appearance did 
diminish her splendour somewhat however, and coupled with her spare 
frame gave her an almost ghostly, wraithlike quality. Yet even then 
Kaede still considered Fumiko the most exquisite creature she had ever 
seen. From her light blue eyes as distinct as though they had been cut 
from azure crystal, to her lustrous dark green hair that flowed down in 
thick waves about her slim shoulders like a crimped mane of overlapping 
lush forest leaves, she was quite simply beautiful. Kaede reflected that 
Fumiko might very well have been the woman accountable for her deep 
appreciation of the female form just for simply being the marvellous 
example of feminine majesty she was. After all, Fumiko was the first 
woman--the first *person*--Kaede had ever been intimate with.

Contrasting Claire, Fumiko was not devoted to Kaede voluntarily. While 
Claire could be described as a concubine, the green-haired maiden was 
the closest match to a slave there was. Fumiko had not been recruited; 
she had been *enslaved*. The young downtrodden woman was a relic of 
Kaede&#39;s stint in the Kanagawa Koutetsu, her finest and most cherished 
relic.

To settle an outstanding monetary debt to the yakuza clan&#39;s cutthroat 
loansharks of a sum he could never hope to pay off himself, Fumiko&#39;s 
father had consented to have his eldest daughter, a university student 
at the time, butchered and her organs harvested to later be sold on the 
black market. Kaede&#39;s bosses in the Kanagawa Koutetsu decided not to 
immediately kill Fumiko however, instead electing to have some &#39;fun&#39; 
with their new acquisition first before her trip to the human 
slaughterhouse. As it was, Kaede had stepped in before either foul fates 
could befall Fumiko, exploiting her respectable standing in the yakuza 
group--which had been mainly built on the substantial stack of dead 
bodies she had amassed during her career--to claim the previously damned 
woman as hers.

Make no mistake; Fumiko&#39;s plight had not incited pity in Kaede. It was 
her unblemished beauty inside and out that had captured Kaede&#39;s 
interest--her unspoiled virtue. To see a pure soul, a true saint in a 
world overrun with sinners, was a rarity. Too frequently where they 
consumed by the hateful environment they were forced to co-inhabit with 
their polar opposites in, their decency shining brightly like a star in 
the night&#39;s sky and attracting the darkness that would close in around 
it and one day dim and distort that light, before snuffing it out 
altogether and replacing it with more shadows. Kaede had wanted to 
preserve that light, that beauty, and bottle it in a sense, keeping it 
for herself to admire.

Legally dead attributable to a forged death certificate and with her 
family having forsaken her, doubtless believing that certificate to be 
testifying the truth by now, Fumiko&#39;s life was utterly in Kaede&#39;s hands 
to do with as she desired, at the mercy of her every capricious whim. 
Fumiko was a slave until she truly did die, for only in death would she 
find freedom. Kaede owned her as someone owns a pet, feeding and 
clothing her and providing the living dead woman with shelter and care 
within the walls of her home, walls that were effectively those of a 
kennel.

No collar was visible around Fumiko&#39;s neck, no binds restraining her 
hands and feet; there wasn&#39;t a need. Acute drug addiction made up her 
chains, the finest of Ishinomori Pharmaceuticals&#39; outlawed products 
snorted up her nose or injected into her veins regularly every day. 
While Fumiko may dream of escape, her dependency on Kaede to supply her 
with her desperately craved-for banned substances kept her in line and 
malleable to her owner&#39;s will. The costly drugs she was hooked on she 
could never afford to buy on the street--if she could even find a 
purveyor who sold the quality product she was accustomed to 
imbibing--and so all the prospects of escape presented at best were that 
of a harsher existence where Fumiko would be forced to scrape for a 
meagre income any way that she could to support her expensive habit. Her 
family would not help her; her own father had traded her life for money, 
after all. There was nowhere for Fumiko to go; her home, prison may it 
be, was wherever Kaede&#39;s home was.

All those factors had their part in making Fumiko the perfect concubine 
in Kaede&#39;s eyes, the perfect toy for her to play with, a saint whose 
esteemed purity she could test the endurance of and see for herself what 
the limits were before a saint chaste of heart and innocent in soul 
de-evolved into a sinner vile in heart and twisted in soul. Claire, for 
all her lovely charms, wasn&#39;t really necessary; an extra treat after the 
main course. But Dominique believed she was, declaring that Kaede should 
have a &#39;proper outlet for her lust&#39;. Kaede was not one to ever spurn her 
guardian&#39;s kind gifts, or not gifts that belonged in her bed at any 
rate, so she had graciously accepted Claire and while not quite 
welcoming her, had partaken of her services on many occasions. There was 
no danger of Claire usurping Fumiko&#39;s special status with Kaede however; 
the innocent doll would always be the white-haired woman&#39;s primary means 
in which to vent her primal desires.

Fumiko held out a fluffy white towel in somewhat unsteady hands to 
Kaede, her head staying down and her eyes remaining dropped to the floor 
and turned away from her mistress&#39;s blood sprayed face, deference and 
fear glimmering with parallel uneasiness in their watery blue depths. 
Fumiko&#39;s trembling extended to her whole body; her slim shoulders 
delicately shivering; and escalated ever so slightly as Kaede&#39;s hand 
neared to take the proffered towel, her muscles tensed to such rigidity 
it was as though they were about to shake apart under the strain.

Fumiko clearly relaxed once Kaede took the towel from her without 
incident, her chest collapsing as she released the breath she had been 
holding. Kaede supposed her slave had a right to be petrified of her 
when bearing in mind what ill-treatment she had put the young woman 
through in the name of her experiment, an experiment that had been 
ongoing now for more than a few years with indignity and torture heaped 
upon indignity and torture. And yet underneath her wretched and 
whitewashed veneer Fumiko&#39;s goodness had survived, her heart still pure 
and her soul unsullied. Her body was withering, her mind shattering... 
but her virtuous essence remained unharmed. In Kaede&#39;s eyes, Fumiko was 
strong. She had the spirit of a warrior.

Kaede scrubbed her face clean of Horiuchi&#39;s blood and of her light sheen 
of built up sweat, and then ran the towel down the back of her neck, 
mopping up more droplets of cool perspiration. Before she could do much 
more however, a pair of hands materialised over her shoulders and took 
the white towel now grimy with maroon smudges from her. Kaede felt the 
towel drape about her neck and shoulders, followed by firm hands 
massaging her recently exercised muscles through it, wiping skin as they 
went. It felt good, soothing after giving over her body to her furious 
spirit, the strong kneading fingers penetrating deep and their motions 
loosening muscles in readiness for another bout of training or combat, 
whenever either may come.

&quot;Now that you have soundly trounced Mr. Horiuchi,&quot; Claire intoned from 
behind Kaede, the owner of the hands, &quot;I presume it is time for 
another...?&quot; The warm breath belonging to her words spoken close to 
Kaede titillated the nape of the white-haired woman&#39;s neck, very nearly 
triggering an electric shiver to tickle her spine that would have had 
nothing to do with the sweat chilling her body. Kaede masked the affects 
of Claire&#39;s breath teasing the hairs on the back of her neck to rise and 
of her concubine&#39;s rubbing hands liquefying her muscles well, aloofness 
her cover. She stood there stoically, immobile and with a shrewd smile 
frozen on her features while Claire tended to her, for all intents and 
purposes appearing oblivious to the redhead&#39;s stimulating ministrations.

&quot;No. Enough,&quot; Kaede murmured quietly, partly in reply to Claire and 
partly to herself. There would be no further sparring against any more 
kenjutsu masters in the safe confines of this training hall. A war was 
being waged outside its secure walls; skills would be honed in true 
duels to the death from now on, perfection with the sword found in the 
ordeals of the battlefield; be they blade against blade or blade against 
gun.

Under Kaede&#39;s seemingly eyeless stare owing to her bangs and adopted 
indifference, Fumiko nervously clutched at the front of her sky blue 
sundress while keeping her head down, wrinkling the thin, virtually 
gossamer material in two tight, clammy, and quivering fists. The dress 
was a sky blue that moulded to her trim frame like a glove to a hand, 
accentuating the shape of her willowy curves such that they were all the 
more gratifying to behold in spite of their narrowness. Kaede had picked 
out the dress for Fumiko to wear herself, as she did the captivating 
woman&#39;s entire wardrobe. It was to be expected that she considered the 
dress enriching to her pet&#39;s natural beauty; it was the core purpose of 
all the outfits she chose for Fumiko. Beautiful creatures should be 
wrapped in beautiful things.

Kaede lifted her bandage-swathed hands and presented them before the 
apprehensive Fumiko&#39;s wilted gaze, trusting that having a task to carry 
out would pose as a distraction and put the frightened lamb a little 
more at ease. A tentative blue gaze slid from the floor to consider 
Kaede&#39;s hands, flitting uneasily between both back and forth, as if she 
was scared to let her eyes loiter on her mistress&#39;s death-dealing hands 
overly long. However, Fumiko was implicitly aware of what was required 
of her and that dawdling or refusal to comply would be frowned upon--and 
frowned upon *hard*--thus her dithering persisted for only a couple of 
seconds before her fear of punishment superseded her fear of touching 
her subjugator&#39;s hands, hands that had disciplined her on countless 
occasions through her and Kaede&#39;s years together.

Fumiko&#39;s hands cupped Kaede&#39;s right one as they would cup a ceremonial 
goblet or prized trophy; carefully and with grave veneration. Kaede&#39;s 
left hand fell to her side as Fumiko&#39;s graceful fingers sought out the 
start of the bandages binding its equivalent, light fingertips smoothing 
and pitter-pattering across the white mesh. The green-haired maiden&#39;s 
touch was soft and gentle and yet possessed an oddly warm trait, and 
Kaede could not help but be lulled by it. It was a simple touch in 
comparison to Claire&#39;s hands working her neck and shoulders, but it did 
much more for her than the massage could ever do.

Kaede could feel her hand beating rhythmically within Fumiko&#39;s two, 
throbbing in time with her heart, as if she were somehow deeply aware of 
every drop of blood pumping in every vessel criss-crossing through it. 
She longed for the bandages to be removed, for the numbing buffer to be 
stripped off and the tactile sensation heightened, experienced as it 
should be with no restrictions, skin on skin. Her breathing was sluggish 
and level, held rapt along with her senses, her being concentrated on 
her hand; ensnared. Everything else seemed to become muted, the 
peripheral slowly dimming; Claire&#39;s pompous voice flattering her on her 
decision to discontinue sparring with fellow sword masters, the 
redhead&#39;s kneading fingers, the rasp of the towel on her flesh, the 
chill of her sweat on her body; it all seemed to fade and become part of 
a dispensed with background, overlooked ahead of an infinitely more 
compelling attraction--the caresses of an angel. Fumiko commanded 
divinity at her fingertips, the quintessence of Heaven contained in her 
every touch. It was calming to Kaede, a taste of the tranquil. For the 
time Fumiko touched her Kaede&#39;s personal crusade didn&#39;t seem so 
important any more, her furious war against Soldats all but forgotten 
and her lust for vengeance gone as if it had never been. There was no 
need to fight and kill, no need to roar and rampage, no need sate the 
desire to avenge in her heart. Kaede was at peace with herself and the 
world around her.

But peace never lasts. It was the concept of dreamers and weaklings, 
blinkered idiots who did not see the world for what it during was--a 
constant battlefield where conflicts continually arose, hearts and minds 
and bodies pitted each other. Kaede mused that there was truth in the 
scenes Claire&#39;s yukata&#39;s illustrated. Kaede&#39;s peace was ruined in this 
instance while Fumiko was unwrapping the last of the bandages around her 
left hand and Claire was swabbing her back with the towel pushed up 
inside her tank top. That ruin came by way of a curt succession of raps 
on the reverse side of the room&#39;s front doors, booming thumps inside the 
cavernous training hall. Kaede instantly stirred from her blissful 
torpor, her body jerking stiffly to attention as recollection of exactly 
who she was returned in a deluge of memories and emotions; that old 
bitter vendetta, that old hot-blooded fury, and that old deep-seated 
hatred.

Kaede turned her head towards the double doors just as they swung open, 
a familiarly uniformed Soldats renegade appearing between them with her 
hands resting on the handles. The elite soldier tilted her head in a 
crisp nod upon her entry--a nod respectful for Kaede&#39;s position and 
apologetic for the interruption. The snow-haired warrior accepted the 
gesture through a stony visage, her smile cold now that her sacred duty 
was restored in her mind to consume her every waking thought once more.

&quot;Pardon the intrusion Lady Kaede,&quot; the guard said, standing in the 
fissure between the hall&#39;s open doors and with her hands still on their 
handles. She was another foreigner, and spoke in clipped French. Not all 
of the Soldats defectors who wore the prestigious silver badge knew 
Japanese, thus the many who did not had resorted to drawing on what 
French they were conversant in to communicate with Kaede. It was 
fortunate that Kaede was very articulate in wielding the language, the 
upshot of abundant lessons with Dominique as a young girl and recurrent 
chats with her former teacher using the tongue while growing older. &quot;But 
Mr. Ryosuke has returned from his trip.&quot;

Kaede gave an immediate start at the mention of her sole surviving and 
dearest blood relation, and a moment later a softer, warmer aura overtly 
took nest around her. The incessant smile on her face lit up tenfold, 
icy and sinister no longer but radiant, a smile that was all ingenuous 
joy simply at hearing that a loved one had come home. Gone was the 
seething crusader; that element of Kaede receding from the fore yet 
again, diluted in an instant to expose the adoring little sister 
shrouded deep underneath.

&quot;Big Brother?&quot; Kaede said, very nearly gushing. &quot;R-Really?&quot; She tried to 
keep her tone level, but the excitement quivering just below her words 
was clear, so close to the surface that it caused her voice to quaver 
also. She so wanted to believe the elite guard&#39;s news but needed to be 
totally sure that her elder brother had in fact returned to Yokohama, to 
the sheltering fortifications of Ishinomori Tower, and not to mention 
still with life in his body. Kaede *had* to see him. See him with her 
own two eyes and verify for herself that he was back and all right.

Big Brother had been away for so long--too long. Away on an important 
mission for the pious cause, yes, but still for too long. Kaede had 
missed him terribly, her loneliness compounding as each day went by 
bearing no word from him either good or bad, and her mounting worry had 
fared no better with the lack of reports. Big Brother&#39;s friends who had 
stayed behind in Japan had tried to reassure her that he could look 
after himself, that he was an adept soldier, a battle-hardened warrior 
like her, but it had not done much to lessen her concern. France had 
been a distance place to Kaede where anything could happen to her older 
brother while he was there, in the middle of a notorious bastion of 
Soldats, the land swarming with the enemy. The fretting sister had known 
that her brother was not entirely alone in the hornet&#39;s nest with 
Vincent to watch his back, the Chinese triad associate an accomplished 
soldier in his own right, but they had still been merely two against 
innumerable opposition. The pair had bet on their small number being 
what would let them slip inside France&#39;s borders and roam within them 
undetected, however Kaede had known that there was little that escaped 
Soldats&#39; myriad of ever-vigilant eyes. Kaede and her supporters had 
gouged most of those eyes from the lands encircling their headquarters 
in Yokohama, but Kanagawa prefecture was a place unique in that regard. 
Soldats&#39; eyes remained very wide open in every other locale across the 
globe.

But that was all moot, now. Big Brother and Vincent had been in the 
thick of enemy territory unaided yet had apparently returned with new 
war stories to recount about their exploits there. Kaede didn&#39;t even 
really care if her brother&#39;s assignment had been fruitful or not; she 
just wanted--needed--to see him. No, that was not completely true. 
Dominique had coveted that old French tome quite badly, and had seemed 
to believe it critical to the achievement of their goals. Therefore a 
part of Kaede did hope that Big Brother had been successful, if just to 
please her cherished guardian. Even the prospect that the book would 
somehow assist them in instigating Soldats&#39; fall was secondary to that. 
A very close secondary, but secondary nonetheless.

&quot;Take me too him,&quot; Kaede half demanded and half implored, not waiting 
for confirmation to her earlier inquiries from the guard. The young 
woman took an impulsive step towards the black clad foreigner and the 
training hall&#39;s front doors, forsaking the nurturing of Claire and 
Fumiko. The first concubine shot her mistress an exasperated glower as 
she was forced to hurriedly jerk the towel out from underneath the back 
of Kaede&#39;s tank top. Claire then crossed her arms huffily, the towel 
suspended between a thumb and forefinger, and twisted her lips in 
displeasure at being totally ignored--the equivalent of a sullen but 
adorable pout for her cute face. Fumiko on the other hand slumped to her 
hands and knees, Kaede&#39;s unexpected movement making her drop the 
bandages she had just unravelled from the kenjutsu master&#39;s left hand. 
Her hands scrambled frantically on the wooden floorboards like a pair of 
ashen spiders for the strips of white fabric, her rather wiry fingers 
their skittering legs, while she whispered a deflated apology. When 
Fumiko had finally gathered the bandages she clasped them to her chest 
and sat upright on her knees, lingering there genuflect on the floor 
looking as meek as ever. But Kaede did not pay heed to the differing 
actions of her pets, the two women all but unseen. She had only one 
interest at the moment. &quot;I must see my brother now,&quot; she reiterated, 
this time with a dash more demand bolstering her voice.

&quot;Not in that state you aren&#39;t!&quot;

Dominique&#39;s throaty yet dignified voice sliced through the air of the 
training hall as sharply and finely as Kaede&#39;s katana would, seizing the 
attention of all, in particular the elite guard holding the room&#39;s doors 
open. The guard spared not a second in yielding a path for her 
division&#39;s first lieutenant, releasing the door handles and bowing low 
in a European fashion, right arm across her chest with her palm over her 
heart, as if in reverence to a monarch. She then slinked out of the room 
as the tall and regal woman marched into it at a vigorous stride, 
Dominique&#39;s long legs sheathed in diaphanous black stockings making 
short work of the distance separating her and Kaede. Dominique stopped 
in front of her charge, the younger woman rendered diminutive by her 
superior height, and Kaede was granted a whiff of the stunning French 
beauty&#39;s aromatic perfume as it wafted over her carried by the draft of 
the curt arrival, a piquant bouquet that enriched the air and excited 
the senses. &quot;Look at you,&quot; Dominique tutted, her hands on her 
well-formed hips, &quot;you can&#39;t see your brother like that! You&#39;re a mess!&quot;

Kaede&#39;s mouth screwed up into a disgruntled pout that was a contest for 
Claire&#39;s as she glanced down at herself, noting her scruffy and very 
casual exercise outfit, with her tank top stippled in places by her 
seeped-through sweat; odorous sweat that she felt still clinging to her 
body while it slowly dried. She wondered if Dominique could smell the 
result of her workout above her perfume, very much hoping that the 
fragrance was heady enough to mask her musk and not offend the older 
woman&#39;s delicate nose. Kaede hoped that there wasn&#39;t any blood still 
left crusting in her hair or caked on her face. Yet despite her, she had 
to admit, plainly beleaguered appearance she wasn&#39;t going to give in 
that easily. &quot;Aww.... But Big Brother...&quot; Kaede whined petulantly, the 
only means she could think of to assail her guardian&#39;s sentiments and 
with any luck inspire her sympathy.

&quot;No!&quot; Dominique said with no-nonsense and a dismissing wave of her hand, 
derailing Kaede&#39;s hopes. &quot;You must bathe and dress appropriately this 
instant. You don&#39;t want your brother&#39;s first sight of you in all these 
weeks to be of you dirty and dishevelled, reeking of perspiration, do 
you?&quot;

Kaede sighed softly to herself and inclined her head slightly in tepid 
assent. She knew when she was beat, and defeat came habitually when 
trying to oppose her strict guardian. Dominique also held great stock in 
physical appearance and personal hygiene; picking up on the pungent 
smell emanating from Kaede must have been the clincher. Kaede had just 
known she would notice it. Dominique always noticed *everything*.

&quot;No...&quot; Kaede said resignedly.

&quot;Yes? What was that?&quot; Dominique persisted, her tone dryly expectant, 
wanting certain obedience.

&quot;I said no...&quot; Kaede restated a little louder, but no less 
lackadaisically.

Dominique smiled affably; her wish fulfilled; and then snapped her 
fingers at Claire, the signal turning into a point at Kaede. &quot;Claire, 
attend to her,&quot; she ordered tersely with a voice used to being obeyed.

Claire threw Dominique a withering look, but a split second later the 
redhead was all bright smiles. She unfolded her arms, slinging the towel 
over a forearm, and then clapped her hands together enthusiastically. 
&quot;Yes, come along now Lady Kaede, let&#39;s get you all washed up for your 
big brother,&quot; she said cheerfully, ushering Kaede towards the doors with 
a gentle hand cupping the snow-haired woman&#39;s left elbow.

Fumiko, still kneeling on the floor, gasped in alarm as she realised 
Claire and her mistress were leaving and rushed to her feet, gliding 
warily past Dominique with her typical lowered gaze and after the pair, 
trailing a few timid steps behind them. Kaede&#39;s personal bodyguard filed 
out after Fumiko, the two that had disposed of Horuichi back from their 
errand, and once they had cleared the hall they moved smartly to loosely 
encircle the trio, ever wary of the surroundings and those who dwelled 
within them, irrespective their station.

&quot;But... but what about Big Brother?&quot; Kaede asked, troubled, casting a 
look back over her shoulder at Dominique who had remained in the 
training hall.

&quot;Oh, not to worry. He&#39;ll still be here after you have bathed and 
dressed,&quot; Dominique placated as she watched Kaede and her entourage 
depart. &quot;There is no hurry.&quot;

Kaede nodded, feeling better thanks to her guardian&#39;s sensible 
assurances. Her step lightened as she was led away to the baths, eager 
to be washed and pampered to sweet-smelling perfection before meeting 
her brother.

&quot;No hurry at all...&quot; Dominique murmured quietly to herself, out of 
Kaede&#39;s earshot. &quot;&#39;Big Brother&#39; can wait.&quot;

******

Wait. Ryosuke had finally set foot on his native Japanese soil once 
again, and with that blasted book of Dominique&#39;s in hand no less, and 
she made him wait. He hadn&#39;t been anticipating an open-armed reception 
from his nemesis by any means, but the cold shoulder treatment was 
mystifying and not to mention frustrating in the extreme. However 
patience was one of Ryosuke&#39;s fortes; he had stoically tolerated 
Dominique&#39;s venomous presence corrupting his family and plaguing his 
home for years now after all. He could dance to her tune--or rather sit 
to it, as was the case here--as gracefully as if he actually relished 
it, whatever that tune may be amended as it often was, the rhythm 
altered by the gaijin&#39;s mercurial caprices. But one day this lithe 
dancer would impassively gambol to not another single beat of his 
musician&#39;s drum, one day he would find a way, an opportunity, to safely 
silence his foil&#39;s music decisively; permanently. But today was not that 
day. So Ryosuke sat. And he waited.

Ryosuke had been notified upon his arrival at Ishinomori Tower that 
Kaede was &#39;engaged with a prior commitment&#39; for the time being, and 
&#39;requested that he wait&#39;. Neither his sister&#39;s words nor the truth. 
Knowing Kaede, if she&#39;d had her way she would have come barrelling 
towards him hours ago, delivering the warm and eager welcome Ryosuke 
would have much preferred over the brush off he had received so far. It 
was obvious that Dominique was responsible for the forced wait. Kaede 
was another dancer to the French woman&#39;s melody, but the music affected 
her differently, like that of a Siren&#39;s enrapturing song. Deplorably 
Dominique had relegated Ryosuke&#39;s little sister to her trusting puppet, 
and Kaede didn&#39;t seem to be remotely aware that she was being readily 
led about by the mere crook of her assistant&#39;s finger. Kaede was known 
to suffer from simple-mindedness sometimes however, and her affection 
for Dominique as... as whatever she viewed her as--surrogate parental 
figure, perhaps?--had probably blinded her to the older woman&#39;s arrant 
yet sly manipulation of her. That deep emotional attachment of Kaede&#39;s 
to her devious tyrant made severing the grip Dominique had on her a very 
grim if not hopeless endeavour for Ryosuke, especially when taking his 
sister&#39;s delicate mindset into account.

The compounding traumas of having both her father and mother ripped out 
of her life before their time, and perhaps the violent manner in which 
they were taken as well, had seemed to inflict equally compounding 
psychological damage on Kaede, lucidity decaying away through the 
never-healing mental scar. Kaede wasn&#39;t the same sister Ryosuke had 
known and grown up with as a young boy. In days so long ago that girl 
had existed, and now his memory of what she had been like then--her 
innocent laughs and sunny smiles, gentle touches and gentler 
disposition--had blurred radically to an indistinct smudge of vague 
images and outlines. A terrible loss, and one he mourned, interred deep 
in a hardened heart. However, enough memory persisted within that smudge 
for Ryosuke to recognise that something was very... wrong... with Kaede. 
But it didn&#39;t take a close sibling of hers to discern that unsettling 
fact. It was like some unknown malignant entity had taken up residence 
in his once sweet younger sister, twisting her, pulling apart her 
innocent and kind nature and warping it into something else, something 
vile and wicked, a hideous mockery of the compassionate soul she had 
once been. Call that entity what you will; a monster, an evil spirit, a 
demon, a devil--it was irrelevant. The distortion of Kaede&#39;s heart and 
mind was done, the corruption complete and seemingly irreparable. Now 
Ryosuke&#39;s sister was a sadistic fanatic, prone to excessive outbursts of 
anger and beset with mad delusions. It pained Ryosuke to see her that 
way. But who was he to say anything about Kaede&#39;s transformation, 
really. They had both changed inside, become darker, jaded. All children 
lose their innocence when touched by the outside world. An inevitability 
of growing up.

Regardless of her mounting insanity, her escalating violent eruptions 
and viciousness, Ryosuke still loved Kaede. Kaede was still his little 
sister, the only family he had left. He would *always* care for her and 
protect her. For those reasons and her fragile state of mind, Ryosuke 
had spared her the truth about their mother and Dominique&#39;s illicit 
relationship and consequent betrayal of their father, and of his 
suspicions that they&#39;d had Shinichi Ishinomori murdered, his convenient 
fatal car accident likely a formulation of foul intent. Ryosuke worried 
what affect the revelations would have on her, the stress of them a 
liable threat to her tenuous hold on what measure of sanity she had 
left. That Dominique was the most trusted and closest person in Kaede&#39;s 
life after--or was that before, now...?--Ryosuke himself also quieted 
his tongue; the treachery of his younger sister&#39;s adored personal 
assistant and confidante likely enough to smash her mind beyond repair, 
the third and final trauma a blow to destroy it outright. Kaede had 
borne enough harm for one lifetime; Ryosuke would be the shield saving 
her from any more emotional anguish, as he ought to be being her older 
brother, even if that meant acting as a shield for Dominique as well, 
keeping her past deceitful sins to himself for his sister&#39;s sake. 
Ryosuke would even go so far as to defend Dominique&#39;s life from harm if 
it were threatened; as long as Kaede felt the way she did about the 
traitorous gaijin he would swallow his hate down like so much rising 
bile and see the woman protected.

But this arrangement would last only as long as Kaede&#39;s fondness for 
Dominique did. The instant their rapport waned, soured, Ryosuke would 
set upon Dominique with the alacrity of a goaded dragon snapping at a 
noxious viper slithering insolently in its lair. He just needed a single 
opening. He would see to it that Dominique would have no chance to evade 
his vengeful bite. The start of all of Kaede&#39;s dire ills led back to her 
by some route, roundabout or in a straight line, but every course 
pointing out damning guilt. Kaede&#39;s broken condition was the result of 
Dominique&#39;s poisonous meddling; she was the lone person to be blamed for 
all... *this*. Ryosuke had no love for Soldats, the murderers of his 
mother, but it was Dominique who was primarily accountable for Hikaru 
Ishinomori&#39;s demise and her daughter&#39;s psychosis. It wasn&#39;t much; it 
wouldn&#39;t bring back his light-hearted and happy little sister, it 
wouldn&#39;t bring back their parents, it wouldn&#39;t mend their mother&#39;s 
wrecked image in his eyes, but Ryosuke would see Dominique punished for 
the grievous wounds she had caused his now tattered family, wounds that 
still bled to this day. Sooner or later he would see her dead. Simply 
that--*dead*.

A shifting of clouds in the sky that Ishinomori Tower scraped unveiled 
the formerly blotted sun, light intense to Ryosuke&#39;s eyes sifting 
through the spaces left by the thick grey blinds hanging over the 
far-stretching window that made one complete wall of the aptly named 
waiting area outside Kaede and Dominique&#39;s executive offices; the wall 
facing the couch where the white-haired man sat with apparent aplomb 
despite having been snubbed, leaning forwards in his seat with his 
forearms resting on his knees. Ryosuke&#39;s reaction to the pain suddenly 
aching behind his eyes was robotic, a hand going inside the front of his 
overcoat and pulling out his round blue-tinted sunglasses, putting them 
on before becoming a picture of cool patience once again.

The thick ancient tome that he and Vincent had successfully smuggled out 
of France after a lengthy and trying hunt in Paris was a weighty 
presence inside his black overcoat, pressing against the already heavy 
steel plates sown into the front of the armoured garment. A weighty 
presence in more ways than one. Ryosuke still didn&#39;t know quite what to 
make of the book, this... &#39;Langonel&#39;s Manuscript&#39;. That Dominique hadn&#39;t 
rushed to meet him and claim the book was bemusing, considering how 
adamant she had been concerning its worth. Maybe obtaining the tome had 
truly only been ploy to get him out of her hair for a while. Or perhaps 
Dominique didn&#39;t want to appear too eager to get her hands on the tome, 
adopting a back flip of her previous stance. Or her intentions of having 
Ryosuke wait like a flouted fool could simply be to further annoy him, 
adding just a final little bit of irritation to an irritating 
assignment.

Ryosuke couldn&#39;t say for sure what Langonel&#39;s Manuscript&#39;s importance or 
Dominique&#39;s need for it--if there was a need--was. A thumb-through 
appraisal of the parchment-like pages of the tome on the flight back to 
Japan had unearthed nothing really of interest printed within, merely 
gibberish penned in French. &#39;Les Soldats&#39; had been referred to several 
times, but the prose was in the style of obscure poetry, reading like an 
abstruse yet epic ballad and accompanied by illustrations drawn in the 
European middle-ages format, castles and knights with moats and swords 
abounding, thick dark lines defining their vividly coloured forms as if 
replicas of stained glass windows in a church consecrated to war. If 
there was anything of value in the book, then Dominique alone knew the 
secrets to finding it.

The eruption of a long, loud, and laboured sigh of acute distaste and 
boredom next to Ryosuke signalled that Vin, who was sitting beside him 
suffering Dominique&#39;s rebuff just as he was, was due for another 
aggravated rant of his, one that would likely be a near exact 
duplication of the rant he had just moaned out several minutes prior... 
and a duplication of the rant several minutes prior to that one as well. 
Vin had the trying tendency of repeating himself when irked--which was 
unfortunately frequently--a sort of nagging complaining, a reoccurring 
whine about whatever petty irritations were bothering him. Dominique 
certainly wasn&#39;t the only person who exercised Ryosuke&#39;s stubborn 
patience. But Ryosuke wanted Vin with him, flaws and all, and now 
especially. Dominique truly seemed to despise the triad affiliate, her 
hostility towards Vin merely being in her presence unmistakable in spite 
of her toil to uphold a low-key exterior fa&ccedil;ade, and that was reason 
enough to keep the man by his side. Anything to give Ryosuke an edge 
over his nemesis.

&quot;I still don&#39;t get why *I* have to be here,&quot; Vin griped, kicking his 
left leg that was crossed over his right rather vigorously. His arms 
were folded behind his head where was he slouched on the couch beside 
Ryosuke, and his eyes were dusky and listless from jetlag, though hooded 
with plain disdain. His watery gaze that clouded the amber in it seemed 
to find fault with everything they saw, the disgruntled grimace to his 
lips rising into a sneer every few moments.

Vin&#39;s attire perhaps played a role in his sour mood. Ryosuke had 
demanded they proceed directly to Ishinomori Tower and Kaede after his 
and Vin&#39;s flight from Paris had touched down, giving his partner very 
little time to freshen himself up. Vin still had on his black suit 
pants, shirt, and tie, rumpled and creased now from too much wear. But 
his jacket that had been soaked through and then encrusted with his 
drying blood in one spot courtesy of a bullet graze had been exchanged 
for a bright red substitute, reasonably kempt from spending time in one 
of his suitcases though affected by having to endure the lengthy plane 
journey. His clothes were nowhere near his usual standards of tidiness, 
something that was probably feeding his displeasure further. The 
arrangement of his red and black garments was not so excruciating to 
behold either, the two colours harmonised in actual fact. Perhaps that 
was the genuine cause of Vin&#39;s ill temper; that his outfit was not gaudy 
enough.

&quot;I mean, why do I have to deliver that book along with you? You don&#39;t 
need me for that!&quot; Vin continued to protest. &quot;What am I supposed to do, 
hold it too as you hand it over?&quot; He scoffed, indicating what he thought 
of that idea. &quot;And frankly Ryochan, and don&#39;t take offence or anything, 
but your sister gives me the creeps. There&#39;s something eerily disturbing 
about not ever being able to see someone&#39;s eyes....&quot; His voice turned 
contemplative trailed off, and Ryosuke believed--or maybe just hoped--he 
would remain silent for a while keeping his thoughts to himself. But 
Ryosuke rarely had good luck.

&quot;She sure is hot, though,&quot; Vin suddenly said in a faraway tone that made 
Ryosuke look at him sidelong past his sunglasses--warning violet. &quot;Ah, 
not that I have any designs on her, you understand,&quot; he hurriedly 
clarified, realising what he had blurted. &quot;Like I said, she gives me the 
creeps.&quot; Vin became flustered once again, an abrupt inhalation. &quot;Not 
that that&#39;s really bad either!&quot; he assured in his next breath, before 
sighing and calming when Ryosuke didn&#39;t react beyond turning his gaze 
away from him in apathy. Vin had nothing to fear from Ryosuke. He did 
not take umbrage at his partner&#39;s remarks; Kaede *was* creepy. But it 
wasn&#39;t her fault. It was *hers*.

&quot;Then there&#39;s Dominique,&quot; Vin went on after a moment, his whining 
regaining its lost steam. Dominique, the person where the fault lied 
with. Whatever criticism Vin had to say about her Ryosuke would 
wholeheartedly condone and concur with. &quot;That stuck-up bitch barely even 
acknowledges me! She looks at me as if she&#39;s wondering whether to plunge 
a knife into my guts or not. I can practically feel the point pricking 
between my shoulder blades when I turn my back to her. I wouldn&#39;t put it 
past her to casually backstab me like that, either. Feh!&quot; Vin shook his 
head in disgust, scowling darkly to himself. But he then sighed in 
resignation, his indignation seeming to evaporate with his released 
breath. &quot;I guess she&#39;s no different from most of the women around here, 
though. Look at them over there. Acting so high and mighty.&quot;

Ryosuke let his eyes focus on his surroundings and his mind concentrate 
on what they were seeing, truly registering the room around him and all 
of its details instead of viewing it in vague, hazy contours. It was a 
familiar locale to him, one he could map with his eyes shut. It was a 
room in his home after all; it didn&#39;t matter that his home happened to 
be a multi-storey skyscraper. The waiting area was as austere as the 
hundreds of other rooms that comprised Ishinomori Tower, piled on top of 
one another and making the building live up to its name. Brushed steel 
was the pervasive motif, also widespread throughout the rest of the 
tower, the walls all silvery blocks spaced with narrow horizontal 
recesses between. The floor was night skies streaked with lightning; 
black tiles shot through with white; and hard enough that boot heels 
clicked on it. A large reception desk sat in the first half on the room, 
off to the right side by the entrance with its back to the wide window 
doubling as a wall. It was a gentle arc of pale wood with a chrome top 
surface and polished finish, styled ascetically to match its stern 
environment. Another desk sat in the rear half of the room, the 
reception desk&#39;s smaller brother, adjacent to the double doors barring 
the way to Dominique&#39;s office. That desk was a security checkpoint, with 
an ebon metal locker mounted on the span of wall behind it, the 
container of several heavy-duty armaments that were definitely not 
regular corporate paraphernalia. The remainder of the waiting area was 
occupied with a neat layout of black leather couches and armchairs, and 
squat square coffee tables of the same pale wood as the security and 
reception desk.

In the centre of the room overlooking everything else was a sculpture 
cast in iron and painted slate grey, though with its coarse exterior and 
colour it could be misjudged as dark granite. It stood on a shiny black 
square base edged with dull gold; a shapeless blob on a pedestal 
stretching out at its onlookers. Ryosuke didn&#39;t know what it was 
supposed to be or supposed to represent. It was conceptual art or some 
such; the sort his mother used to think was fascinating and 
aesthetically attractive. He had never learned why. To Ryosuke, his 
mother&#39;s feelings, her thoughts and motivations, would always be just 
like that sculpture--an unfathomable chaotic mass, alien in form and 
feature. Beyond his understanding.

Ryosuke was also instinctively aware of everybody and anybody that 
dwelled in the room with him, regardless of where his eyes or mind may 
be. Even in one&#39;s home one should never relax their guard. But then 
Ryosuke&#39;s home had been infested with unwanted visitors who had taken up 
permanent residence. Anybody else with any sense would remain on their 
strictest guard too.

Ryosuke trailed Vin&#39;s discontented glower across the expanse of the room 
to where a soft hubbub of female voices came from. A gaggle of women 
dressed immaculately in what Vin called &#39;power suits&#39; inhabited the rear 
half of the waiting area, distinctly segregated from where Ryosuke and 
Vin were seated with the abstract sculpture the unofficial border. The 
black-clad women had the gall to treat this room as their own personal 
lounge, a place where they could go to unwind and commune in when they 
did not have any pressing duties to fulfil. It was a popular haunt for 
most of them, perhaps because it was as close as they could get to their 
leader&#39;s office. That leader being Dominique, of course.

Scanning his gaze over the dozens of generally foreign women socialising 
demurely, Ryosuke felt the dull throbbing beginnings of a migraine 
drumming against the inside of his skull. There were so many of them 
now, dozens indeed--dozens upon dozens. Their numbers had started out 
tiny, five or six at most, but as the campaign against Soldats raged on 
they had inflated to more than a hundred, and were still rising. Over a 
hundred invaders in his family&#39;s home, spreading like vermin. They were 
all women; not so odd when considering that man-hater Dominique had done 
the recruiting. They were also somehow related to her, either 
sympathisers of their opposition against Soldats or friends of hers. 
Which exactly didn&#39;t really matter; it was enough to know that they were 
loyal only to their own flock and Dominique who headed it. They did obey 
Kaede&#39;s orders--reiterated through Dominique, unsurprisingly--but 
Ryosuke had an inkling that they complied because it suited them to do 
so, not out of any sense of allegiance. Ryosuke watched them with a 
suspicious eye, wary that they would turn upon his sister if the tide of 
the war against Soldats ever did.

Ryosuke had to admit that the women were frighteningly good at whatever 
assignment they performed, however. Be it manning the security stations 
guarding the most sensitive locations in Ishinomori Tower, coordinating 
strikes against Soldats safehouses and businesses, or participating in 
those strikes themselves, they did their job with cool efficiency and 
superior competency. Garbed in black suits like uniforms as they were 
and with their no-nonsense attitude towards anything they did and 
everyone outside their clique, the women were almost like government 
agents belonging to some war-torn country. Maybe they were for all 
Ryosuke knew.

One would think Ryosuke would be appreciative of the women&#39;s 
effectiveness and skill in matters of combat--especially when a small 
squad of the elite force had been posted as Kaede&#39;s bodyguard, in charge 
of her personal welfare--but his mistrust of them precluded any such 
laudable sentiments. He was in fact opposed to the outsiders being 
assigned to work so closely to his sister and functioning in so 
significant a role as bodyguard--it was grim as it was already, the way 
they spearheaded the majority of their operations to lay low Soldats 
instead of their own household soldiers doing the job. The Ishinomori 
group&#39;s forces had been demoted to menial guard drudgery and worse, 
fodder to bleed and be sacrificed for the benefit of Dominique&#39;s cohorts 
to triumph. It positively *infuriated* Ryosuke for his family&#39;s soldiers 
to be... *used* like that, exploited as if they were nothing more than 
meat shields to soak up bullets and blades, his brothers-in-arms sent 
off to slaughters that were completely unjustified. Losses were heavy 
among his brothers as to be anticipated being mistreated as they were, 
while those of Dominique&#39;s side had suffered less than a handful of 
recorded fatalities. True, her faction had the tools and the talent to 
utilise those tools expertly, their weaponry on par with military 
arsenal and the training to match, but the gap between casualty figures 
was far too wide. Ryosuke was losing his friends, people who had trusted 
Kaede and their family, people who had trusted *him*. Something had to 
be done. Kaede wouldn&#39;t listen; Dominique had her too wrapped around her 
little finger. It was up to Ryosuke. He would do something to stop the 
wasteful bloodshed of his brothers. Just what that something would be 
however, was a question he had yet to find an answer to.

The neatly dressed and primly composed women ignored Ryosuke and Vin in 
the commandeered waiting area for the most part; one or two of them only 
occasionally shooting them unwelcome frowns that suggested they go 
elsewhere... and soon. But the antagonistic vibes radiating from across 
the room at the two men were strong and glaring. Ryosuke&#39;s distinguished 
position in the Ishinomori group was practically meaningless to 
Dominique&#39;s faction; he was granted the barest respect and courtesy, 
with their underlying animosity for him very thinly veiled if at all. 
They took after their charming commander in that regard.

&quot;No matter what I do or what I say, every single one of those women 
either ignore me like I&#39;m not there and I just happen to be talking to 
myself, or they treat me like some mangy stray mutt nuzzling at their 
crotch, with a slap to my snout and kick to my ribs looming,&quot; Vin went 
on. &quot;Not one, not *one* of them has ever expressed even the remotest 
level of interest. At first I thought I was wearing bad cologne or 
something, or that it was some bizarre westerner thing, but even the 
Asians among them behave the same. Prudes, the lot of them. And probably 
all celibate too, I bet. I wouldn&#39;t put it past them.&quot; He sighed once 
again, but it was closer to a growl of frustration. Vin wasn&#39;t 
accustomed to his fine looks and overt but entrancing advances flopping, 
and flopping so awfully at that.

Vin sullenly averted his bleary eyes from Dominique&#39;s black uniformed 
storm troopers, tearing them away with such force one would think they 
had been stuck. &quot;I hate this place,&quot; he muttered to himself under his 
breath.

The gleaming chrome doors that led to the hallway outside the waiting 
area swung open smoothly and silently on their well-lubricated hinges, 
admitting a man and increasing the male population in the room, though 
still leaving them hugely outnumbered. However, Ishinomori Tower&#39;s total 
inhabitants tipped tremendously in favour of the fairer sex lately.

The man&#39;s entry drew the deadened violet eyes of Ryosuke, as well as 
many other eyes he expected, eyes with less than hospitable sheens to 
them. But the man ignored them all and the women they belonged to, 
zeroing in on Ryosuke instead. With a distracted wave of his hand he 
forestalled the receptionist&#39;s approaching inquiry, her mouth that had 
been open with the words on the tip of her tongue snapping closed 
belligerently. The woman staffing the reception desk threw a miffed 
glare in his direction, but all it met was his disinterested back. This 
seemed to anger the receptionist even more, the man leaving her fuming 
wordlessly. She wasn&#39;t a member of Dominique&#39;s faction; dressed instead 
like a typical office lady, but the black swathed militants had that 
sort of affect on a lot of the other women in Ishinomori Tower. Their 
enmity was apparently infectious.

The man was Ryosuke&#39;s age yet seemed older, more worn--rougher around 
the edges. Although he was dressed in a suit and shirt, navy and inky 
blue respectively, he had that certain look about him that betrayed a 
harsh background--he was no cultured gentleman. That his clothes were 
slightly slovenly on his scrawny frame didn&#39;t improve his image; his 
shirt was hanging out over his pants and unbuttoned a little too far 
down from the collar, displaying a gold chain-like necklace looping low 
on his bare chest. More gold jewellery sparkled on his fingers and 
wrists, heavy rings and heavier thick bracelets, gaudy enough to be on 
par with Vin&#39;s fashion sense and the rings bulky enough to lend extra 
power to his punches; knuckleduster equivalents. He looked like a thug 
who would always be a thug, a gangster right down to his bones, and one 
who could talk more fluently with his fists than he could with his 
mouth. A gangster who would probably *prefer* to talk with his fists.

And the people who thought that would be right. Ryosuke knew this 
man--Ken Ushijima. He was old school yakuza, and a comrade from the 
Kanagawa Koutetsu. A brother. A friend.

Ken nodded to Vin in greeting, a greeting ignored by the still surly 
man, and then inclined his head to Ryosuke. &quot;Aniki. I heard you were 
back,&quot; he said, standing before the couch where Ryosuke and Vin sat. &quot;It 
is good you made it home safe.&quot;

Ryosuke looked up at Ken through his sunglasses for a moment, and then 
dropped his eyes again, staring ahead into space. &quot;I see nothing has 
changed here,&quot; he remarked softly, bordering on resigned.

&quot;No, nothing,&quot; Ken said, his voice joining Ryosuke&#39;s in its resignation 
as he cast a look at the women mingling quietly together on the other 
side of the room. He rubbed a hand over his near-bald head, his hair 
buzzed down to a black layer of fuzz. Ken was old school yakuza, but not 
old school enough to sport a punch perm. &quot;More come every day, squeezing 
themselves into our group and squeezing us out. It&#39;s hard to have a say 
in operations when everybody we have is a bloody grunt.&quot;

Ryosuke didn&#39;t reply; nothing really had changed. &quot;How is Kaede? I 
thought you and the rest would be with her.&quot; There was a hint of 
dangerous reproach in his voice.

&quot;Relax, aniki. Kumicho is pretty much the same as usual, as far as I can 
tell,&quot; Ken reported while searching through his pants pockets, finally 
pulling out a torn and crumpled packet of cigarettes. &quot;You know she&#39;s 
tough as... heh, steel.&quot;

&quot;Sister complex....&quot; Vin muttered, eliciting a glance and a smirk from 
Ken. Ryosuke ignored them both. They didn&#39;t have any sisters.

&quot;You being away made her kinda edgier, but that&#39;s all,&quot; Ken continued, 
tapping a cigarette partway out from the packet against his opposite 
hand. &quot;Kumicho hasn&#39;t taken part in any big offensives while you were 
gone either. Gutting the odd prisoner is the closest she&#39;s come to any 
Soldats bastard. Nothing to worry yourself about.&quot; That was debatable. 
Ishinomori Tower wasn&#39;t the impenetrable fortress it used to be. Snakes 
had slithered into their midst, one in particular coiling its scaly hide 
around Kaede and whispering in her ear with its forked tongue. Nowhere 
was totally safe. There was always cause to worry.

Ken brought the packet of cigarettes to his mouth and tugged the 
protruding one free between his lips. The receptionist, who had been 
watching his, Ryosuke&#39;s, and Vin&#39;s every move in the manner of a school 
teacher watching troublemaking students and waiting for them--expecting 
them--to do something &#39;inappropriate&#39;, cleared her throat noisily and 
meaningfully behind him before tapping a fingernail against the 
&#39;no-smoking&#39; sign on window frame by her head with pointed clicks, a 
tight smile on her face as though she enjoyed her preconceptions being 
validated. A couple of Dominique&#39;s supports who stood the closest to 
Ryosuke and his comrades, previously chatting by the sculpture, also 
turned sharp looks at Ken and his cigarette, hands going sternly to hips 
or arms being folded crossly.

Ken, frozen with his cigarette held in his pursed lips, first glanced 
over his shoulder at the intolerant receptionist and then to his right 
at the bad-tempered women, his eyebrows raised and his brown eyes 
bugging out a bit, obviously realising his faux pas but seeming unsure 
what to do about it... or perhaps unsure what his critics would do. A 
diehard gangster he was, but he was in the midst of questionable 
allies--potential enemies more like--on virtually hostile ground. And 
unlike Vin, Ken had great respect for the opposite sex. Too much some 
would say, but it was true he was a gentleman in that respect despite 
his shady life.

Ken reached slowly for his cigarette with his left hand, the hand not 
holding the packet, taking it tentatively out of his mouth as though any 
quicker motion would bring down the women&#39;s devastating wrath upon him. 
The metallic clicks of Ryosuke flipping open his silver lighter and then 
thumbing forth the flame pre-empted anything else, attracting the 
surprised stare of Ken as well as the livid glares of Dominique&#39;s two 
supporters. Ryosuke held out the lighter to his brother; a torch to 
rekindle his spirit and a hand to steady his nerves. Ryosuke would be 
damned if he&#39;d let one of his own show frailty here, for dozens of 
Dominique&#39;s allies to see.

Following a brief instant of hesitation, Ken wisely availed himself of 
Ryosuke&#39;s proffered lighter and lit the end of his cigarette. He took a 
somewhat cautious drag from it, eyeing the women next to the sculpture 
dubiously. Judging by their incensed expressions, the gaijins were 
affronted by the blatant exhibition of insolence yet held their spiteful 
tongues, settling for hurling fiery daggers through their eyes at Ken 
and Ryosuke. They wouldn&#39;t raise an objection or move to enforce the 
violated policy while Ryosuke, a blood relation of the Ishinomori 
family, was in attendance with the infractor. It didn&#39;t matter that he 
had instigated the infringement; his station did permit him some limited 
personal freedom. The respect of Dominique&#39;s followers at least extended 
that much, though it was often just for show. As soon as Ken was 
separated from him the women, including the bold receptionist, would 
likely swoop upon the gangster like a flock of ravenous vultures.

&quot;Ah, thanks aniki,&quot; Ken said in a puff of smoke that wafted above 
Ryosuke and Vin&#39;s heads. The cigarette was held between the fingers and 
thumb of his left hand, but his pinkie finger stayed rigid, sticking 
straight out as if the cigarette was a delicate bone china teacup he was 
elegantly sipping from. Looking intently, one could tell that the skin 
tone of his little finger didn&#39;t quite match the rest of his hand--just 
a tad pinker shade. In addition the finger&#39;s texture looked too smooth, 
lacking the soft and subtle dimples and wrinkles of supple flesh. Ken&#39;s 
left pinkie finger was a prosthetic, a memento of a debt paid to the 
kumicho of the Kanagawa Koutetsu for a weakness of character years ago. 
The failure was unimportant now; amends had been made, the issue 
resolved. The Kanagawa Koutetsu was disbanded anyway, the old bosses 
dead, in prison, or simply gone, nowhere to be found. It was the same 
for most of its members.

A stickler for honour and tradition, Ken hadn&#39;t wanted to attach a false 
finger to the stump that had remained after he had tendered the digit as 
compensation. Ryosuke knew the missing finger had been a reminder of his 
disgrace, the shame something not to be hidden but endured and 
remembered so that the failing may never be repeated. Ken was yakuza 
through and through. But appearing to have all of his fingers intact at 
least at initial inspection improved his ability to blend in; the 
absence of a pinkie--and one that had been so cleanly amputated--was 
normally an accurate indication of an individual&#39;s history being 
intimately entwined with a yakuza clan, a history disreputable in the 
eyes of the general public and those aligned with law and order. 
Sometimes advertising a yakuza affiliation, past or present, plain for 
any eye to see was not desirable.

&quot;Second-hand smoke polluting my lungs,&quot; Vin mumbled petulantly to 
himself as Ken&#39;s cigarette smoke blew over him, his head turned away 
from Ryosuke and his partner&#39;s old friend. &quot;Inconsiderate jerks all 
around me. Cancer&#39;s going to kill me faster than any bullet will. Hmph.&quot; 
Ryosuke supposed Vin was on the women&#39;s side when it came to the 
no-smoking regulation.

&quot;The rest of the guys are around,&quot; Ken said to Ryosuke, either not 
hearing Vin or pointedly taking no notice of his belligerent mutterings. 
&quot;On a break, I guess you could say.&quot; He sighed wearily, smoke clouding 
the air in front of his face. &quot;Can&#39;t get real close to kumicho when 
she&#39;s here in the tower anymore.&quot; Ken tossed his head to the right, 
towards the other half of the room that Dominique&#39;s soldiers occupied. 
&quot;Those women that are always near her have been clamping down, freezing 
us out. I basically just shadow them where I can. But at least a couple 
of us go with kumicho when she leaves the tower, and stick damn close. 
You know we&#39;d never let her out of our sight then. There&#39;s nothing those 
women could do to stop us protecting our kumicho outside the tower short 
of putting a couple dozen bullets in us.&quot;

Ryosuke merely nodded. Not all the ex-members of the defunct Kanagawa 
Koutetsu group where dead, in jail, or missing. Those that had decided 
to throw in their lot with the Ishinomori family following the group&#39;s 
seizure of Yokohama and virtually all of Kanagawa prefecture after it 
had gravitated to Ryosuke, looking at him as their boss, though their 
official leader was Kaede. There weren&#39;t many of that core left now, the 
numbers dwindling as a result of fatal clashes with Soldats operatives 
and suicidal stratagems imposed by Dominique and her lieutenants. The 
scant few that had evaded such a fate thus far were Ryosuke&#39;s closest 
comrades, some of his best friends from his former yakuza clan, and the 
men that he had appointed to guard Kaede with their lives. This put them 
at constant and caustic odds with the squad Dominique had assigned to 
supposedly protect Kaede, the two sides vying to be the chief holders of 
that responsibility. It was a struggle Ryosuke&#39;s men were slowly giving 
ground on, slowly but surely being pushed into the background and away 
from Kaede more and more. Kaede, for her role in the affair, was 
non-partisan, behaving like all the people who comprised her bodyguard 
were trivial annoyances she had to live with. Ryosuke had tried to 
influence her in supporting their old yakuza brothers, citing that they 
were drastically more trustworthy. But Dominique, as always, had his 
sister&#39;s ears first and foremost... and covered them when she wanted to.

Ryosuke cocked his embittered gaze towards the doors of his nemesis&#39;s 
office as one of the two cracked open, another foreign woman in a black 
suit slipping quietly into the waiting room. She took a second to spot 
Ryosuke and his company across on the other side of the room, and then 
immediately proceeded straight towards them, weaving between her fellow 
soldiers that littered her path. The woman came to a halt on Ryosuke&#39;s 
left, next to the black leather couch he and Vin were sitting and 
lounging on respectively, purposely standing an ample distance away from 
Ken. A hand when to her hip and she raised her chin haughtily, literally 
peering down her nose at Ryosuke.

&quot;Lady Kaede will see you now,&quot; she notified him, her scornful tone 
suggesting that she thought it chore to tell him and that his sister was 
being entirely too charitable, as if he was an impertinent lowbrow 
commoner stubbornly seeking audience with a queen. It rolled off 
Ryosuke&#39;s back however, stoicism the only thing he bared. The contempt 
conveyed towards him from Dominique&#39;s supporters wasn&#39;t anything new, 
and his daily exposure to it had numbed him. Let them and their 
commander do their worst.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time!&quot; Vin spat as he sat up on the couch, his arms 
unfolding from behind his head and his legs uncrossing, feet stamping on 
the floor. He was obviously no follower of stoicism. Vin bent forwards 
in his seat while he glowered at &#39;Kaede&#39;s&#39; messenger, his forearms on 
his knees. &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting for fucking ages! I thought you&#39;d left us 
here to rot!&quot; It wouldn&#39;t have shocked Ryosuke if that were actually the 
case.

The woman smiled thinly at Vin and his berating; a falsely--and 
scarcely--civil smile that hid fury behind it and promising vicious 
reprisals later... if she had the nerve. While Vin was seen as an even 
lower form of life in the Ishinomori group than Ryosuke, Dominique&#39;s 
soldiers were presumably wary of his capabilities since they had never 
made a hostile move against him. Yet, at any rate. His partnership with 
Ryosuke probably also benefited his position, though doubtless not very 
much when bearing in mind where the eldest Ishinomori family relative 
ranked in the soldiers&#39; estimations.

The messenger stepped to the side, turning and flourishing an arm out in 
invitation for Ryosuke and Vin to go ahead of her. The light from the 
expanse of window opposite caught something silver on the collar of her 
black suit jacket, a shining star dazzling on the blanket of dark. The 
tiny blades of twin swords flashed, light shimmering down their lengths. 
The star was the badge that Dominique&#39;s co-conspirators had the habit of 
wearing without fail during all the times Ryosuke had seen them, a 
telltale sign of their despicable allegiance; disk-shaped with the 
insignia of two women kneeling in front of one another and brandishing 
upright double-edged swords that knights from the European middle ages 
once plied.

The sight of the emblem jogged Ryosuke&#39;s memory, the flash of worked 
metal a flash in his mind, the silver crest becoming a brown embossment 
on old cracked leather. His right hand reflexively went to his chest, 
over his heart and over the book stowed inside his overcoat. Ryosuke 
should have recognised it sooner; the pins Dominique&#39;s soldiers showed 
off was the same as the design imprinted on the front cover of 
Langonel&#39;s Manuscript. Not for the first time he reconsidered his 
decision to hand over the tome to Dominique. If it weakened Soldats 
somehow that was all well and good, however if it came at the cost of 
Dominique and her faction being strengthened.... But to present himself 
empty handed before Dominique and Kaede would be perilous; the cunning 
gaijin would certainly use his perceived failure to further corrupt his 
image in his little sister&#39;s eyes. Dominique had craftily exploited the 
weight of her word to promote the importance of Langonel&#39;s Manuscript to 
Kaede, meaning that the younger woman now wanted it too. And Ryosuke was 
loath to disappoint his sister. He was trapped and he knew it, his 
choice no choice at all. He couldn&#39;t afford to relinquish any more 
footing in Kaede&#39;s heart to Dominique&#39;s stranglehold; he had to dig his 
heels in and retain every shred of purchase he had. To have any more 
wrenched away from him was to lose his sister&#39;s heart completely to 
Dominique.

Vin hauling himself ungainly to his feet and then curtly shouldering by 
Ken cleared Ryosuke&#39;s mind of the metallic flash and its implications, 
his partner&#39;s morose griping, too low to actually hear, also playing its 
part. With the laid-back way Vin moved one wouldn&#39;t believe he had been 
winged in a gunfight some long hours past, the scathing bullet providing 
basis for the term &#39;close shave&#39;, having ripped by a little too near to 
the gangster&#39;s body and scoring a gash in his flesh. A hasty provisional 
patch-up job in a restroom of Charles de Gaulle International Airport 
had apparently been enough to stanch the wound if not the pain, but Vin 
had not brought up his injury since. Ryosuke had been relieved his 
partner hadn&#39;t been more seriously hurt. It would have been... 
problematic.

Ryosuke got to his feet after Vin, standing slowly up to his full height 
like an awakened behemoth or erected ebon monolith, towering over 
everybody else around him. With pounding strides and a faint chinking of 
steel he traversed the minefield of women ahead of him, his compelling 
presence still sufficient enough to carve a route through otherwise 
immovable beings, Vin trailing dourly at his heels and the messenger 
marching arrogantly after them both, a swagger in her step.

Ryosuke turned an eye over his left shoulder, past Vin and the escorting 
soldier and through the black forest of prospective backstabbers, back 
to where he had left Ken. As he had predicted, the forest had expanded, 
putting out branches in his wake. Three of Dominique&#39;s supporters penned 
Ken, his lit cigarette the flame for these moths. Ken disgustingly 
folded fast under their pitiless frowns and demanding postures, a rueful 
grin on his sheepish face while he stubbed out his crime on his 
prosthetic pinkie and then bent the cigarette with his thumb. Ryosuke 
doubted his old friend would be waiting there, alone in a gathering 
place of their rivals, on his return.

Nearing the doors to Dominique&#39;s office, which would then in turn lead 
to Kaede&#39;s, another black business suit clad woman sitting 
sophisticatedly yet casually on the edge of the security desk flanking 
the office entrance slipped off her perch to bar Ryosuke and Vin&#39;s path. 
&quot;You are familiar with the procedure,&quot; she half-questioned levelly while 
the soldier who had marshalled the two men took up position by her side, 
folding her arms firmly with a conceited smirk on her face, bolstering 
the doors&#39; blockade.

Familiar with the procedure Ryosuke and Vin were; it was a procedure 
that rankled them both, insolent and unwarranted for the likes of them 
with their exalted stations. Moving to one side, over to the security 
desk under the watchful eyes and smug looks of the 
soldiers-turned-sentries, they began relinquishing their arms, each 
dumping the weapons into a waiting tray. Some weapons, at any rate. A 
knowing look passed between Ryosuke and Vin after they were done, the 
trays containing no more than a couple of armaments; the primary weapons 
that they were known to carry. There were no metal detectors to go 
through--or for the special qualities of Ryosuke&#39;s coat to play havoc 
with--here unlike in more travelled areas of the tower, and the guards 
were disinclined to pat the men down. Ordinarily the sloppy security 
measures &#39;safeguarding&#39; Kaede&#39;s place of work would enrage Ryosuke, 
however in this case it permitted him to circumvent Dominique&#39;s 
draconian regulations that unjustly applied to him. His signature 
revolver was gone as was his piano wire, but there were a lot more 
weapons still secreted about his person, stowed away inside his black 
overcoat. He knew for fact it was the same for Vin; his comrade&#39;s pair 
of Beretta elites lay in the tray, except that was a mere tiny fraction 
of the weapons he kept close to his body. As rankling as the &#39;no 
weapons&#39; policy was, it didn&#39;t come near to as rankling as it could have 
been.

Satisfied, the guard who had reminded Ryosuke and Vin of the rules to 
entering their leader&#39;s and Kaede&#39;s offices ushered them onwards with a 
bored dismissing wave before parking herself on the security desk again, 
furrowing her brow at her nails. In the meantime the other woman opened 
one of double doors and held it in place, giving a shepherding wave of 
her own; an impatient wave. Not wanting to wait any longer than they 
already had anyway, Ryosuke and Vin were only too willing to comply, the 
latter man in his foul temperament violently shoving the door that was 
still closed open, sending it flying as he cleared his path.

The two gangsters trudged from one side of Dominique&#39;s empty office to 
Kaede&#39;s office on the opposing side briskly, a somewhat anxious quiet 
around them once the soldier had shut the doors behind them, shutting 
out all but the most animated chatter going on in the waiting room in 
tandem, shrinking it to a soft droning of minimal waxes and wanes. An 
expectant atmosphere saturated the office, the air tingling, electric; 
an atmosphere where breaths were held and hearts quickened. Ryosuke&#39;s 
feet couldn&#39;t get him to Kaede&#39;s office doors fast enough.

Consequently Ryosuke was the one to barge through doors this time, the 
thump of his impetuous hands slapping against them as he flung away the 
obstructions his announcing knock. He knew Kaede would not be by 
herself, and he did not reserve any etiquette for the usurper she would 
be in the company of. He could impart just as little courtesy towards 
Dominique as she and her minions did towards him.

And sure enough Ryosuke&#39;s nemesis was right by Kaede&#39;s side as near as 
could be, all but rubbing his nose in their familiarity as if she had 
arranged it so he would burst in to behold it at that precise moment. 
His sister sat behind a broad desk at the far end of her spacious 
office, papers of all kinds and sizes ranging from report portfolios to 
huge blueprints strewn haphazardly across it with a good number having 
fallen on the floor. Behind the desk beside her, actually leaning over 
her with a hand clapped intimately on her shoulder, whispering full red 
lips by Kaede&#39;s left ear and long dark locks but for a tress of silver 
spilling over the younger woman&#39;s chest, was Dominique.

Upon Ryosuke&#39;s brash entrance Dominique&#39;s turned her attention to the 
office&#39;s doors, and her hushed lips curled upwards into a self-satisfied 
smile at the sight of him. She took her time in straightening, but her 
hand stayed where it was comfortably on Kaede&#39;s shoulder, a 
representation and reminder of the &#39;guidance&#39; she endowed her prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
with. Guidance. What a joke. It was more akin to the puppeteer&#39;s hand 
steadying her puppet. By rights Kaede should be sitting on Dominique&#39;s 
lap, being bounced on the gaijin&#39;s knee.

Ryosuke&#39;s brusque pace had stuttered facing the loathsome scene, but he 
and it recovered swiftly, the man averse to let Dominique see how her 
closeness to Kaede impacted him. Vin traced his step a couple of feet 
behind him, walking into the office with a laboured attempt to act 
nonchalant, an attempt that as a result fell short of passable. His gait 
was too stiff, his footfalls too heavy and feet dragging with 
reluctance, and his eyes darted everywhere except where he was going. 
Vin was clearly uneasy, probably sensing the antagonistic ambiance he 
had to be aware materialised whenever Ryosuke and Dominique came into 
proximity with each other.

Kaede&#39;s office was big, more in common with a living room in size and 
furnishings. There was a bar complete with stools in one corner and a 
lounge set in another, the latter with a gigantic black wood cabinet 
against the wall opposite that was home to a media centre. All of the 
furnishings were in drab shades, be they black like the cabinet or 
chrome like the trimmings of the bar. Yet not everything was dull. 
Paintings hung on the silver walls; vividly coloured though what they 
depicted with their strange groupings of geometric shapes or unruly 
masses of lines and swirls was anybody&#39;s guess. Vases, statuettes and 
other ornaments decorated the room, some of the most attractive curios 
given spots on pedestals or small tables.

As brightening as these decorative endeavours might have been in the 
past, now they were layered with dust and melancholy. The vases that had 
once contained fresh flowers of vibrant yellows and reds, whites and 
pinks, were all empty. The lustre of silverware and gloss of ceramic had 
faded. The knick-knacks and pictures were leftovers from Hikaru 
Ishinomori&#39;s days; this had been her office before her passing. It was 
as though the room was dying slowly, following after its previous owner, 
its lingering beauty decaying a bit more each day. Kaede had done 
nothing to change the d&eacute;cor, adding nothing and removing nothing; 
touching nothing but the desk, and allowed none but those she was close 
to permission to step foot inside. Ryosuke wasn&#39;t sure whether to be 
grateful for her yearning to cling to the past or to lament it. It... 
hurt... seeing their mother&#39;s things placed as they had been while she 
was alive, and it hurt seeing them wither from her absence. And it hurt 
that he didn&#39;t know why she had chosen such items to decorate her office 
with, why she had liked this painting or why she had liked that urn. 
Kaede had ultimately spent more time with their mother than Ryosuke had; 
she knew and understood her better than he. Sometimes he wished... he 
wished.... What did it matter. Most of his wishes were regrets, and the 
sort that could not be reconciled. Just those responsible made to pay.

&quot;Ryosuke, dear boy, you have returned!&quot; Dominique gushed with false 
elation and relief, the smugness in her smile replaced by feigned 
delight. The glanced at Vin and sniffed derisively, the feigned delight 
vanishing for an instant in lieu of disapproval. It had been worth 
bringing Vin along just to provoke such a response from Dominique. For 
his part, Vin, immersed in his charade of casualness, didn&#39;t appear to 
notice her allergic reaction to him.

&quot;Big Brother!&quot; Kaede squealed excitedly, evidently taking no insult at 
Ryosuke&#39;s rude arrival. But then she was forever sweetness to her 
brother, childlike in spirit and demeanour at the mere sight or mention 
of him. While it could be said it was an improvement over fervour and 
fury, seeing Kaede like this brought its own brand of pain. However, for 
the moment at least, the sight of his sister made contentment and relief 
well up in Ryosuke&#39;s chest, drowning the dark thoughts concerning 
perverted innocence and devastated family ties. For now he was simply 
glad to lay eyes on his beloved little sister--glad to be home.

Holding stoicism in his heart and retaining it over his features as 
usual, Ryosuke walked across the ash-coloured carpet, the pile from the 
doors to the desk flattened by countless feet that had treaded there 
before. He stopped a metre or so from the desk--Kaede&#39;s desk now--and 
Vin stood adjacent to him on his right, his partner&#39;s gaze still 
avoidant, the two of them in line with the private elevator on the 
right-hand wall that was used to travel conveniently between the CEO&#39;s 
office and the rest of the tower, specifically the living quarters 
upstairs. Kaede quivered in her high-backed chair at their--or rather, 
Ryosuke&#39;s--approach, smiling gaily, and the tall gangster believed she 
would be bouncing in her seat if not for Dominique&#39;s restraining hand on 
her shoulder. The grip of that hand seemed to tighten as Ryosuke and Vin 
neared, well-manicured nails almost threatening to dig into Kaede&#39;s 
flesh.

&quot;I trust the operation went smoothly?&quot; Dominique probed in her cultured 
tones that persisted even when speaking Japanese, a tinge of menace 
entwined with the civility that warned of reprisals if she didn&#39;t like 
the answer

&quot;No,&quot; Ryosuke deadpanned despite the caution, glaring harshly over the 
rim of his sunglasses at the French woman. &quot;It did not.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it was a fine thing you did telling us to call ourselves Noir!&quot; 
Vin suddenly burst out with, his eyes most definitely on Dominique now. 
The amber in them smouldered, looking like molten syrup. &quot;It nearly got 
our heads blown off when the *real* Noir showed up!&quot;

Ryosuke spared a guarded glance at Kaede, gauging the effect his 
partner&#39;s anger at her close confidante had on her. She was known to 
defend Dominique passionately, with violent retaliations the most common 
method. However in this instance Kaede appeared unperturbed, simply 
sitting there in her chair with that happy smile on her face. Lucky for 
Vin.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Dominique remarked, her eyebrows rising and the hand not laying 
claim to Kaede going to her chest in theatrical surprise. &quot;I was unaware 
that they still existed, let alone were still living in Paris.&quot; She 
smiled, though it was more of a smirk. &quot;But it couldn&#39;t have been that 
bad, now could it? You are both here, standing before Lady Kaede and 
myself looking none the worse for wear, may I say.&quot;

&quot;Hey! I got shot!&quot; Vin exclaimed, one hand heatedly flinging open the 
right side of his suit jacket while the other flailed animatedly. He 
gritted his teeth, growling in his throat as burning eyes shot flames at 
Dominique. Then all of a sudden his ire melted away, his expression 
becoming meditative and his gaze heading skywards, to the ceiling. &quot;But 
it did set up a meeting between me and that blonde woman,&quot; he said much 
more amicably, and seemingly to no one in particular. &quot;Did I ever tell 
you I have a thing for blondes?&quot; Vin&#39;s usefulness in this situation had 
come to an end.

&quot;Your abrupt stroke of insight regarding the whereabouts of the book was 
fortuitous,&quot; Ryosuke said, suspicion paramount. &quot;A pity it hadn&#39;t come 
sooner. It would have expedited the... errand.&quot;

&quot;I have my sources,&quot; Dominique replied, her smirk perhaps a touch 
fuller. &quot;Sometimes they work fast, sometimes they do not.&quot;

Tired of sparring with Dominique, and tired of her deft ripostes at 
every turn, Ryosuke strode forwards a step, pulling out Langonel&#39;s 
Manuscript from inside his coat, and then dumped it unceremoniously on 
the desk with a jarring thud that rattled the writing utensils atop it. 
&quot;There,&quot; he stated coldly, stepping back to his former position. &quot;Your 
book.&quot;

&quot;I knew you would do it, Big Brother!&quot; Kaede commended as if she truly 
never had a doubt in her mind, before leaning out of her seat and across 
the desk to peer at the tome through her bangs.

Dominique bent forward in conjunction with Kaede, her eyes visibly 
growing bigger and lighting up at the sight of the book, emeralds 
polishing to a luminous gleam. She traced the emblem on the front cover 
with her gaze, Ryosuke watching it move along every line. For that brief 
moment until she stood straight once again Dominique&#39;s pretences 
vanished, her expression nearly matching Kaede&#39;s ingenuous face. Ryosuke 
wondered if he had made a terrible mistake giving her Langonel&#39;s 
Manuscript. Too late now, and what was one more regret.

&quot;Good... good,&quot; Dominique said somewhat breathlessly, her left hand 
unconsciously smoothing over her skirt. &quot;Now, I imagine you are weary 
from your trip,&quot; she said, back to her old self. &quot;I suggest you both go 
and rest.&quot; The dismissal was clear. She had what she wanted.

&quot;Awww!&quot; Kaede moaned, turning in her chair to look up at Dominique next 
to her.

&quot;Now, now; we have discussed this,&quot; Dominique retorted to the whining, 
smiling patiently down at Kaede, her hand rubbing the younger woman&#39;s 
shoulder. The easy rapport made Ryosuke&#39;s stomach churn and bile sear 
the back of his throat. &quot;You can see your brother after he rests.&quot;

Kaede pouted, but nodded in half-hearted acceptance. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in 
your suite later, Big Brother,&quot; she said disappointedly.

Vin was already making a beeline for the exit when Ryosuke turned around 
to leave also, Dominique having put a hex on him spending any private 
time with his sister for at least several hours. It was really nothing 
new, but after so long being apart from Kaede the pill was especially 
bitter to swallow, bleeding acid all the way down.

Ryosuke suddenly halted halfway to the doors of the office, his head 
angling slightly back towards his left shoulder. &quot;One more thing. Two 
more, in fact,&quot; he declared grimly. &quot;Noir... they are still alive. And 
they want that book.&quot; He then carried on the remainder of the distance 
to the doors, hoping he had stuck a thorn in Dominique and that the 
wound, however small to begin with, would fester. As for himself, the 
two young ladies who made up Noir were present only in the farthest 
reaches of the back of his mind. Ryosuke had more pressing concerns.
