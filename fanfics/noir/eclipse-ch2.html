<h1>Eclipse (part 2 of 32)</h1>

<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Noir. I&#39;ve almost come to hate the word, hate what it&#39;s done to me, to 
us. I check outside the window again, but don&#39;t see any sign we&#39;re being 
watched. I sigh and go back to cleaning my gun. Is it too much to ask, 
to just be able to live as Kirika? I know it&#39;s wrong, but I want this to 
be Uncle&#39;s problem, not mine.

&quot;Sorry to be so selfish.&quot; I mutter an apology to him under my breath.

I hear a car door slam, and jump up to the window and survey the street 
as Mireille emerges from Anton&#39;s sporty car. Still no sign we&#39;re being 
followed. Maybe my prayers will be answered.

Anton&#39;s laughter drifts upward and I can&#39;t help but smile as it seems to 
break the tension in the air. I hear them climbing the stairs, and go 
hide my gun. I sit down at the computer and turn it on, pretending to 
work.

&quot;Well top of the evening to you, little bit!&quot; Anton bellows cheerily as 
they come through the door. I stand up and open my arms, knowing that 
I&#39;m about to be swallowed up.

&quot;What do you say we all go out to dinner? My treat!&quot; he squashes me 
happily into his chest.

&quot;No!&quot; I cry out, alarmed at the thought of going out again.

&quot;Hey there, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; he lets go of me and pats my head.

&quot;Um, nothing.&quot; I look down at the floor, trying to think of what to say.

&quot;Kirika, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mireille frowns as she comes out of the 
bathroom. &quot;Do you not feel well?&quot;

&quot;My...my stomach.&quot; I hold my stomach for emphasis. &quot;It&#39;s upset.&quot;

Anton makes a clucking sound. &quot;She&#39;s got a sensitive little tummy, that 
one.&quot;

Mireille says nothing, and puts her hands on her hips, staring at me. 
Then she turns back towards Anton.

&quot;Another night then. I&#39;ll walk you to the door.&quot; She motions to him and 
they walk away. I slump back down into the computer chair, ashamed at my 
actions. I&#39;ve never felt fear like this before. What is wrong with me?

I hear her come back into the room, and she comes to me quietly, putting 
her hand on my shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s not your stomach.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Tell me.&quot; Her hands are in my hair, and I feel my head roll back at her 
touch. I want to relax, but I can&#39;t.

&quot;We were followed today. In the park.&quot;

Her hands drop to my shoulders, gripping them.

&quot;I don&#39;t know who.&quot; I answer her silent question. &quot;And they didn&#39;t 
follow me home.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; She says quietly. I hear her sigh, and her hands squeeze my 
shoulders more tightly. &quot;So our actions as Noir may still be following 
us.&quot;

I hang my head down. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be Noir anymore.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I.&quot; she whispers into my ear. &quot;But I&#39;m not so sure we have a 
choice.&quot;</pre>
