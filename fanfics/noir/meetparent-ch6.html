<h1>Meet the Parent (part 6 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The promised time was after lunch. It was just ten o&#39; clock in the 
morning now. Mireille and Kirika simply had to wait until the promised 
time came.

&quot;Mireille..&quot; Kirika said in a soft voice.

Mireille stopped browsing in the internet and glanced at Kirika. 
&quot;Hmm..?&quot;

Kirika walked to where Mireille was. &quot;This is not too serious, isn&#39;t 
it..?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Mireille looked at Kirika, who was now in front of her.

The shorter one of the two looked up to see a pair of blue eyes was 
gazing at her.

As the brunette was about to speak more, Mireille said, &quot;Hope so.&quot; The 
blonde smiled. &quot;Looks like you really like her.&quot;

Kirika replied her smile and whispered something which Mireille couldn&#39;t 
hear clearly. &quot;...&quot;

&quot;What did you say, Kirika..?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; was the brunette&#39;s reply.

Mireille and Kirika waited, as they drank tea, chat and played with the 
sleeping Adeline. Finally it was lunch time. Kirika and Mireille had 
lunch in a small restaurant near the apartment. After that, they went to 
the clinic. Once again they saw the oriental building which painted 
yellow and red. They walked over to the front door. There, Mireille 
knocked a few times.

Just seconds after, Mireille and Kirika could hear someone&#39;s footsteps 
were approaching the door from inside. The door was slowly opened and 
they saw the familiar face greeted them.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Dr. Naomi said as she smiled. Dr. Naomi first looked at 
Mireille, before she glanced at Kirika. Her facial expression changed a 
little when she saw the Japanese girl&#39;s face. The female vet was 
obviously tried to hide her disappointment to see Kirika. &quot;Come in, 
girls.&quot;

It was the second time for both Kirika and Mireille to step into the 
clinic. As expected that they came to visit, they were brought to a 
deeper part of the clinic. It was likely that Dr. Naomi&#39;s house was 
inside the clinic.

&quot;We can talk here.&quot; The female vet finally said, as she stopped walking.

They were standing in an empty and tidy room which has only a big blue 
sofa, a regular TV, and a table. The room was painted white rather than 
yellow or red, which made it different from the rest of the rooms. From 
the furniture above, it was as if the room was designed to receive 
guests. Mireille and Kirika sat on the big sofa, while Dr. Naomi walked 
to another room. When the female doctor showed up, she brought a chair 
with her.

&quot;Doc...&quot;

&quot;I will sit here, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Dr. Naomi cut off Mireille&#39;s line, as she 
placed the chair in front of the two, despite the empty space in the 
sofa. The female vet first made herself comfortable to sit on the chair 
before said &quot;So.. about your parents, Mireille..&quot;

&quot;Huh..?&quot; muttered Mireille, confused.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry that they were already dead.&quot; Dr. Naomi said calmly.

She knows?! What is the real identity of this woman, for god&#39;s sake..!

Mireille felt uncomfortable with the topic. After all, she fully aware 
that it was Kirika who killed her parents, tough Kirika never wish for 
it. The blonde had already forgiven Kirika for sure. But, this topic was 
too sensitive for the brunette, in Mireille&#39;s opinion. The blonde 
remembered the last time the Japanese girl apologized to her, both of 
them almost cried. Mireille glanced at Kirika, and saw that the brunette 
made a slight reaction. A very little one, which could be realize by 
Mireille only.

&quot;Kirika..?&quot; Mireille asked in a worried tone.

Kirika smiled at Mireille, &quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;

&quot;Actually I will talk a lot about Mireille&#39;s parents, Kirika.&quot; Dr. Naomi 
said, smiling.

Kirika said nothing and remained quite.

Mireille stared angrily at Dr. Naomi, tough the vet herself seemed to 
ignore it. &quot;Kirika.. maybe.. maybe you want to wait outside for a 
while..?&quot;

The Japanese girl looked up to see Dr. Naomi. Kirika hesitated first, 
but in the end agreed and whispered, &quot;Okay.&quot; The brunette stood up and 
walked out from the room.

Mireille felt guilty to brought Kirika here, as the brunette in the end 
had to wait outside. Dr. Naomi obviously didn&#39;t want Kirika to hear the 
conversation. Convinced herself that Kirika had left, Mireille said in 
an angry tone, &quot;You bastard. Don&#39;t you have any other ways to make her 
leave this room?!&quot; The blonde&#39;s voice was not firm, as she was really 
angry to the doctor in front of her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for that.&quot; Dr. Naomi apologized. &quot;But I can&#39;t help it. You 
brought her here.&quot;

&quot;Leave that for later.&quot; Mireille said, as she looked at Dr. Naomi. The 
blonde asked sharply in a serious tone, &quot;Who are you..?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m currently a vet.&quot; The older girl said shortly.

Mireille hesitated for a moment, before asking, &quot;Is it Kirika in the 
photo you have?&quot;

Dr. Naomi wore some surprised expression. &quot;Photo..??&quot;

The blonde said lazily, &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me.&quot; Then she added 
coldly, &quot;You were the one who drop your wallet on purpose. Admit it 
yourself.&quot;

The female vet laughed. &quot;It was due for you to recognize me.&quot;

&quot;It is really Kirika..? Mireille&#39;s voice was barely heard.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Mireille had prepared herself to accept any answer. &quot;I don&#39;t trust you 
though. Why do you have it..?&quot;

&quot;Someone gave it to me.&quot;

&quot;What for..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi lowered her head, before a second after she looked and stared 
at Mireille&#39;s blue eyes. Mireille also looked at Dr. Naomi&#39;s eyes. A 
pair of crisp brown eyes met with blue ones.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me.&quot; Dr. Naomi finally said.

&quot;What do you mean..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi answered seriously, &quot;I am Kirika&#39;s mother.&quot;

Tough Mireille had mentally prepared herself, she gasped the moment she 
heard that sentence. Kirika&#39;s mother..

The similarity between Kirika and Dr. Naomi actually was not too 
obvious. But still, Mireille did recognize it as time passed by. For one 
example, both Kirika and Dr. Naomi&#39;s eyes were kind of similar, 
especially the colour part. Mireille observed Dr. Naomi. If Kirika have 
a long hair, with black for its colour, would she be like her..?

After a long silence between them, Mireille said, &quot;I don&#39;t believe you 
completely, tough from physically, you two do resembled each other.&quot;

&quot;I have proof with me.&quot;

&quot;Show me.&quot; Mireille insisted.

Dr. Naomi went to another room of the house, and brought a thick book 
with her when she came back. Inside the book there were a photo album 
and a birth certificate. The birth certificate somehow seemed convincing 
from the old looks, and Kirika&#39;s name was written there. Her name really 
is Kirika, eh..?

The blonde didn&#39;t want to check longer on the birth certificate, so she 
took the photo album out. Mireille saw the photo of the woman who seemed 
to be a younger version of Dr. Naomi with a man who was likely to be 
Kirika&#39;s father from the look, and maybe, Kirika on the age of 2 or 3. 
They were posing in front a small house. The next photo was the photo of 
the three of them laughing cheerfully in a room. The sound of flickered 
pages of the album was the only one heard in the room as no one talked. 
The more pages opened, the wider Mireille&#39;s eyes became. The blonde 
found it hard to not realize the similarity of the girl in the photo 
with Kirika. Finally the last page had been seen by Mireille.

&quot;How do you know that this girl,&quot; Mireille pointed at the little girl 
who resembled Kirika in one of the photos, &quot;is Kirika..?&quot;

&quot;I have checked it when I took a bath with her.&quot;

Mireille exclaimed, &quot;TOOK A BATH?!&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Dr. Naomi said calmly tough the doctor wore a shocked expression 
as to hear the blonde exclaimed loudly. &quot;Why did you exclaim..?&quot;

Mireille felt embarrassed on herself. &quot;Er.. Sorry. I just didn&#39;t hear 
about it from Kirika.&quot; Mireille gathered up her mind. &quot;So, how did you 
convince me..? You just took a bath... with her.&quot;

&quot;I saw the birthmark.&quot;

Mireille raised her eyebrows. &quot;Birthmark..? Where?&quot;

&quot;Behind her left ear. A very small one.&quot;

Such a small birthmark, Mireille herself knew nothing about it. &quot;I see.&quot;

Dr. Naomi smiled, &quot;So, you believe me..?&quot;

&quot;Not really.. &quot;

&quot;Your doubt was already enough for me to prove it.&quot; The female doctor 
said.

Mireille decided to ignore the female vet for a while. Her mind wondered 
to Kirika. Her first meeting with Kirika. She remembered all the story 
the brunette had told her. The Japanese girl&#39;s ambition. Kirika&#39;s 
smiling and sad face. Suddenly Mireille felt some kind of hatred towards 
Dr. Naomi, as Kirika&#39;s mother.

Mireille tried to hold her emotion and asked, &quot;Say, you threw her to 
Soldats, didn&#39;t you..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi nodded weakly.

She said furiously, &quot;Say if I do believe you. Tell me, why did you leave 
Kirika alone..? Thanks to you for throwing her away to Soldats, she 
became a prodigy of an assassin who only knew how to kill..! What have 
you been doing until now..?!!! Are you really a mother..??&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Dr. Naomi smile faded upon heard this. The female vet then shut 
her mouth and became silent.

As Mireille was about to shouted more, she saw Dr. Naomi was slowly 
shaking. Strangely, the doctor was about to cry. Mireille felt a bit 
guilty to say all the things back then, tough the blonde didn&#39;t even 
consider to apologize.

&quot;It&#39;s true. I... I am not qualified... to be a mother. Threw... threw 
her away like that..&quot; Dr. Naomi was sobbing, as she was also shaking 
greatly.

Mireille just kept silent and waited for Dr. Naomi to stop crying. After 
about ten minutes, Dr. Naomi had regained her calmness.

Decided not to argue about Dr. Naomi &quot;un-motherly-like&quot; further more, 
the blonde asked calmly, &quot;Dr. Naomi.. What is your purpose, telling me 
all this..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi took a deep breath and said, &quot;I gave up for Kirika just about 
two weeks ago. But all of the sudden, you and Kirika went to my clinic.&quot; 
The female vet looked up at the ceiling as if she was remembering the 
moment. &quot; Just then I realized that she is my daughter I have been 
searching for. It is all based on my feeling. So I arranged all of this 
to know you and her more.&quot;

Mireille listened to the older woman patiently.

Dr. Naomi looked at Mireille seriously. &quot;Could you please... make her 
acknowledge me..?&quot;

&quot;What..?!&quot; Mireille asked out of confusion. &quot;I can&#39;t just jump in and 
said to Kirika: Hey, you have a mother living near here!&quot; Doesn&#39;t she 
realize that she have made her waited too long..? I thought her parents 
already died..!

Dr. Naomi smiled. &quot;I just had a feeling that you can help me somehow.&quot;

&quot;You yourself must tell her.&quot; Mireille said sharply. &quot;Tough I doubt that 
she will believe you.&quot;

&quot;But still I need your help.&quot;

Mireille kept silent. Help..

As Dr. Naomi could read Mireille&#39;s mind, she smiled and said, &quot;Yes. 
Maybe you can let me visit or invite her more.&quot;

There was actually another question in Mireille&#39;s mind. The blonde 
decided to speak it up. &quot;What would you do when she acknowledges you..?&quot;

The female vet smiled and said matter-of-factly, &quot;Of course I will bring 
her back home.&quot;

With that last sentence, their conversation end. Mireille felt that it 
would be too long for Kirika to wait for her. The blonde knew the best 
that Kirika wasn&#39;t a fool. The brunette surely enough would know that 
something she couldn&#39;t know was happened between Mireille and Dr. Naomi. 
Mireille said goodbye to the female vet and walked out from the clinic. 
She found Kirika was outside the clinic, embracing a wild cat. The cat 
ran away the moment Mireille showed up.

&quot;Sorry to make you wait this long.&quot; said Mireille.

Kirika smiled. &quot;That cat accompanied me, so it&#39;s fine.&quot; The Japanese 
looking girl stood up and said softly, &quot;But I hope I receive an 
apologizing gift.&quot;

Mireille laughed. &quot;I&#39;ll treat you an ice cream, then.&quot;

They went to the park, not far away from Dr. Naomi&#39;s clinic. There they 
bought two ice creams from the ice cream man. Mireille and Kirika then 
walked to sit at the bench. It was evening now, and most people were 
outside at this time. They could see people walking all over, while most 
children happily played in the park. The scenery was comforting and 
peaceful, and the two quietly enjoyed their ice cream.

&quot;Kirika..&quot; Mireille glanced at the younger girl beside her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry 
that Dr. Naomi had made you waited outside.&quot;

The Japanese girl smiled slightly and whispered, &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Kirika 
licked her ice cream and asked in a soft voice, &quot;So.. It&#39;s about your 
parents..?&quot;

&quot;U.. Uh...&quot; stuttered the blonde as she licked her vanilla ice cream.

The Japanese girl had now stopped licking her ice cream and started to 
stare at Mireille, as the brunette&#39;s brown eyes glowing brightly and a 
bit, naughty.

Not again... </pre>
