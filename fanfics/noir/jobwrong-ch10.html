       Three days passed, three days spent in near silence. Not the 
comfortable silence that they sometimes enjoyed, but a tense silence. An 
uncomfortable one that seemed to smother the both of them in it&#39;s grip. 
Three days, and still those fat bastards had not managed to decide on a 
single mission for them!

	Kirika was bored and frustrated. Sure New York was nice, but she 
would have by far preferred their small apartment in Paris. Not least 
because it didn&#39;t have a dead man in the closet who was starting to 
smell, despite their efforts to the contrary. No not least because of 
that. That was just one factor. The food here.... it was awful! Kirika 
didn&#39;t think she had ever been forced to consume so much grease in her 
life!

	But it was neither the smell nor the food that made her so 
frustrated.... It was of course the Corsican blonde who was in the 
shower. Kirika could hear her now, being in the bedroom as she was, the 
blonde was humming to herself, but the simple melody reached her ears 
nonetheless. 

	Kirika was so confused. Sure she had promised to take it slowly 
with Mireille, but not backwards! Three days, and not one thing romantic 
had happened between them. Sure Mireille was a little friendlier, but a 
friend was not what Kirika wanted her to be right now.... well, not just 
as a friend.  Kirika was hungry. And not for grease.

	She had not felt Mireille&#39;s touch for so long, not tasted her warm 
lips for days. It was killing her. To go now.... into the shower and to 
press her body against Mireille&#39;s own, to melt into her love&#39;s back- No! 
Slow, take it slow. Copping a feel in the shower is not considered slow! 
Still, she could have her fantasies. 

	Ughh, I need help!.....Wait! Of course, why had she not considered 
it before?

	&quot;Mireille!?&quot; She called out, raising her voice to reach the blonde 
over the sound of the shower, the humming paused.

	&quot;Yes?&quot; Mireille replied loudly. Kirika was already donning a 
jacket and pushing her small wallet into it. Mireille had made Kirika a 
bank account and put a fair amount of money into it too. They had both 
earned it of course, but Mireille thought it would be prudent if Kirika 
could access some money. Besides it was not as if she was going to 
squander it on unnecessary things.....That was Mireille&#39;s department.

	&quot;I&#39;m going out for a bit. I have no idea when I&#39;ll be back.&quot; She 
called out, leaning her back against the bathroom door so she could 
better hear the blonde, what she didn&#39;t know however was that for once, 
Mireille had forgotten to lock it. 

	Kirika let out a small &quot;Eep!&quot; of surprise as the door swung 
backwards and she fell through. She tried to regain her footing before 
she hit the floor, but the shower had made the tiles treacherous and she 
landed in an undignified heap on the floor. 

	&quot;Oww.&quot; She moaned as she climbed to her feet. Halfway up she saw 
Mireille&#39;s bare foot tapping against the wet floor. Uh-oh. She looked 
up. The blonde was dressed in a light pink gown, slightly damp from her 
quick exit of the shower, her hair was soaking. Kirika couldn&#39;t stop her 
eyes from trailing up her bare, wet legs and up to her face. Her face 
was beautiful. 
       
Her eyes however, were blazing.

	&quot;Look Mireille.... I didn&#39;t mean it,.. was leaning against door... 
open.. slipped-&quot; She blurted out quickly hoping to divert the Corsican&#39;s 
wrath. Mireille let out a suffering sigh, apparently seeing the truth in 
her eyes.

	&quot;Alright, I forgot to lock the door. Where are you going then?&quot; 
Kirika blushed slightly at the last question. Giving the first answer 
that came to her mind. The stupidest answer there was, the answer that 
told everyone that she was going somewhere she wasn&#39;t supposed to go.

	&quot;Nowhere....&quot; .....Nice one.... her mind muttered sarcastically at 
her. Mireille raised an elegant eyebrow.

	&quot;Well, okay. Be back from nowhere by ten at the latest.&quot; Kirika 
nodded, blushing slightly before rushing from the room and into the 
elevator. She hoped Mireille wasn&#39;t planning to follow her, but she was 
rewarded by the sight of an empty street when she left the hotel.  
Alright, now to find where one is.... 

	Kirika was adamant. Kirika was filled with righteous clarity. 
Kirika.... was going to see a Psychiatrist. 

________________________________________________________________________

	&quot;That was strange....&quot; Mireille muttered to herself as she sat on 
the bed and began meticulously brushing her long blonde hair. It wasn&#39;t 
like Kirika to hold things from her, and defenitely not like her, now or 
as she had been, to go out on her own. 

	She wondered if the girl was longing for company... The company of 
another woman? After all, Mireille had been less than forthcoming about 
their &quot;relationship&quot;. After all, Mireille didn&#39;t want to be in a 
relationship with Kirika. You enjoyed it when she kissed you, her mind 
snidely remarked. She pounded the voice down. 

	&quot;Sexual pleasure is made to be pleasurable.&quot; Mireille began to 
herself, &quot;So of course it was pleasurable when she kissed me, it doesn&#39;t 
mean I&#39;m a lesbian, nor that I want Kirika as anything more than a 
friend.&quot; She smiled as she finished what was soon becoming a mantra.

	You found no pleasure when Silvana Kissed you.... Dammit, the 
voice was right. But that didn&#39;t count, since it wasn&#39;t meant to be 
pleasurable. Kisses conveyed messages, that one sent the message that 
she would soon die. 

	And Kirika&#39;s sent the message that she wants to tear off your 
clothes and devour you.... 

	&quot;Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!&quot; She cried out angrily. She was sick 
of this turmoil. &quot;I am NOT in love with her, and that&#39;s final!&quot; There 
was no reply from the voice that was her mind, but the silence was not 
comforting. It had the ring of the words; &quot;We&#39;ll see....&quot; in it.

________________________________________________________________________

	&quot;So then....&quot; The middle aged, dark haired woman began. Her voice 
was supposed to be comforting, but it reminded Kirika of the voice her 
teachers in Japan had used when instructing students. That bored done.

	Kirika was laid back on what she had been told was a Freudian 
style couch necessary for this form of therapy. She felt vulnerable, but 
she had her Beretta, and could move faster than the woman with the 
clipboard and pen. 

	&quot;Tell me about yourself.....&quot; Kirika decided to give her the 
truthful basics. But to keep it quick, she had already found out that 
therapy was expensive! 

	&quot;My name is Kirika, I&#39;m seventeen, I am Asian by birth but lived 
elsewhere for the first part of my life. I have amnesia so can remember 
none of it, but I was trained from an early age to be an assassin-&quot; The 
woman interrupted.

	&quot;An assassin?!&quot; She sounded caught.

	&quot;It&#39;s someone who kills people for money.&quot; Kirika patiently 
explained.

	&quot;I know what an assassin is girl, if this is a joke it&#39;s not 
funny.&quot; Kirika sighed angrily and waved her gun at the woman. Who&#39;s eyes 
were glued to the barrel.

	&quot;I know it&#39;s not funny. Seven hundred dollars an hour is never 
funny.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s state law that I have to report criminals....&quot; She began.

	&quot;It&#39;s assassin&#39;s law that I have to kill those who know who I 
am.....&quot; Kirika countered. &quot;I assume it&#39;s your desire not to adhere to 
either of said laws?&quot; Kirika was feeling evil, in a funny kind of way. 
This was fun. 

	&quot;I suppose we can each make a compromise......&quot; The woman laughed 
nervously before sitting slowly back. Her eyes didn&#39;t leave the gun, 
even when it was tucked back in Kirika&#39;s pocket.

	&quot;Anyway, I now have a partner in the business. She&#39;s a beautiful 
woman and I think I&#39;ve come to depend on her, and now I think I&#39;ve 
fallen in love with her....&quot; The woman laughed genuinely and Kirika 
looked away glumly. Great, now even this woman found her situation 
amusing. 

	&quot;Nice.&quot; She complimented between laughs. &quot;An amnesiac, lesbian 
assassin.&quot; Kirika waited less than patiently for the woman to quiet 
down. &quot;So what&#39;s the problem?&quot;

	&quot;I would have thought that obvious!&quot; Kirika blurted out. &quot;One, I 
don&#39;t think she wants to be a lesbian, two, she asked me to take it slow 
when she found out, and three, I&#39;ve been taking it slow, but now I&#39;m 
F*ing losing my mind!&quot; Her voice was shrill at the last.

	&quot;You want advice on how to maybe speed things up...?&quot; Kirika 
nodded.

	&quot;Yes, without breaking my promise. I don&#39;t want to force her, I 
want her to want to....&quot; She would never force her.... never..... not to 
Mireille....

	&quot;Okaaay. Well, it&#39;s an old method but why don&#39;t you try paying 
more attention to someone else. Find a girlfriend and lavish all your 
attention on the girl and ignore your partner. Before she knows it 
she&#39;ll be driven mad with jealousy. Then she&#39;ll call you to task and 
you&#39;ll have a very mad, but very ready lover.&quot; Kirika&#39;s eyes were wide.

	Pretend to love someone else, make Mireille jealous? It could go 
wrong in soooo many ways. One, Mireille was an assassin, she might kill 
the other, or Kirika. Two, Kirika would have to break the other person&#39;s 
heart. Three, Kirika would have to find someone to go out with her, or 
pretend to. And four, The final result is Mireille angry..... 

	&quot;I&#39;ll give it a go, thanks.&quot; Kirika sighed raising to her feet. 
&quot;And if I even suspect you told anyone about me I&#39;ll kill you.&quot; The 
woman nodded before watching Kirika leave.

	&quot;Damn.&quot; She whispered, &quot;That little girl is so screwed....&quot;


	Lazy me, that&#39;s all I wrote. But it does set the scene for the 
catastrophes that are to happen in the next chapter...heh-heh.
