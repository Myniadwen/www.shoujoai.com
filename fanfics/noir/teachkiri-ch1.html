<h1>Teaching Kirika Yuumura</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bulmafox.html">Bulmafox</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kirika stood in front of Mireille, both of them naked. Her heart raced 
as she thought about what she was about to do. All she had to do was 
take a few steps toward her partner. She could still back out if she 
wanted to. Thing was, she didn&#39;t. She had been preparing for this moment 
for months now; she wasn&#39;t going to back out now that she was about to 
make love to Mireille.

It had started with a kiss. After Kirika recovered from the gunshot 
wound she sustained at the Manor, Mireille told Kirika she read her 
letter, which prompted a long conversation about their relationship; 
among other things, both women told the other that she loved her, and 
promised to stay together. Afterwards, Kirika shyly kissed Mireille; 
just a little peck on the lips, but it was enough to ignite their 
passion. Their kisses deepened and soon kissing wasn&#39;t enough; they both 
felt the need to touch and be touched by the other. They started 
stroking each other everywhere they pleased while kissing passionately 
for long stretches of time; something Mireille called &#39;making out&#39;. 
Eventually Kirika started longing for Mireille&#39;s body in a way she 
hadn&#39;t previously, and she wondered if there was something more to this 
intimacy thing, something she was missing.

It was around that time she learned about something called sex. Kirika 
never asked anybody at school what it was--most people feared her, and 
those who didn&#39;t, the popular ones, looked down on her--so she had 
started eavesdropping on their conversations instead. What she learned 
from the popular girls was that it was the ultimate expression of 
intimacy between two people who wanted each other&#39;s body, which finally 
put a word to what Kirika had been wanting to do with Mireille. She also 
learned that both partners had to be naked. Beyond that, the girls&#39; 
information was useless, seeing as how all their partners were men. She 
tried listening in on the guys to learn how to please a woman, but all 
she heard was them bragging about how many girls they did. Kirika 
considered looking it up on the Net, but she was afraid of Mireille 
looking through her history and finding out where she&#39;d been, so she 
didn&#39;t. So Kirika was on her own.

Meanwhile, Mireille had gradually been leading her there. She had bought 
a couch, so they could make out comfortably without using the bed, and 
to hopefully smooth the transition from making out to making love for 
Kirika. She also started touching Kirika in more intimate places and 
removing her clothes, little by little. Kirika just followed her lead, 
figuring her partner was much more experienced than herself. The younger 
woman grew apprehensive when they began making out in their underwear; 
while she had been reading up in the more obscure gay and lesbian 
bookstores, she still felt her knowledge lacking. She told herself she 
would be ready when she knew exactly how to please her partner.

In fact, Kirika had decided she really was ready only a few minutes ago. 
She had just gotten home from grocery shopping when she heard soft moans 
coming from the bathroom. She immediately dropped the bag and rushed in, 
not caring what she was barging in on. &quot;Mireille...&quot; she choked out, 
trying unsuccessfully to hide the betrayed look on her face, &quot;H-how 
could you? I...mean...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Kirika?&quot; Mireille asked without looking up.

&quot;I thought...I...thought...&quot;

&quot;You thought what?&quot; Mireille turned around. Upon seeing Kirika&#39;s pained 
expression, she hastily shouted, &quot;No! There&#39;s no one else in here! I 
promise.&quot;

Kirika started scouring the bathroom anyway. &quot;Where is she? Where&#39;s your 
lover?&quot;

&quot;Kirika. Kirika.&quot; Mireille stepped out of the bathtub and took the 
younger girl by the shoulders. &quot;Kirika, listen to me.&quot; She made sure 
Kirika was looking right at her before continuing. &quot;Kirika. I would 
never cheat on you. We made a promise to each other and I&#39;m not going to 
break it, not after everything we&#39;ve been through.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but--&quot;

&quot;I was the only one making that noise. Trust me, I wouldn&#39;t lie about 
something like this.&quot;

Kirika started to calm down, and she looked visibly relieved. That was 
when she noticed It. She hadn&#39;t paid attention in her agitated state, 
but now that she&#39;d calmed down, she suddenly noticed how absolutely 
gorgeous Mireille&#39;s naked body was. She impulsively reached up and 
kissed the older woman, who wrapped her arms around the younger one. 
Kirika ran her hand down Mireille&#39;s body and awkwardly fondled her 
breasts. Already she felt herself fumbling, and she tore herself away 
and ran, gripped by insecurity.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Mireille chased her partner into the living area. &quot;Kirika, 
what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She found her standing in front of the window, hugging 
herself, very obviously trying not to cry. She lightly touched her 
shoulder. &quot;Kirika, what&#39;s the matter?&quot;

Kirika sniffled. &quot;I thought I was ready. I really want to do this, 
really...but,&quot; another sniffle, &quot;I don&#39;t know anything. I don&#39;t know how 
to make love to you.&quot;

&quot;Is that all? That&#39;s what was eating you?&quot;

Kirika turned around. &quot;&#39;Is that all&#39;? Mireille, I don&#39;t want to let you 
down.&quot;

&quot;What? You could never let me down, not because of *that*. Besides, 
everyone, even the experts, have to start *somewhere*. Even if you turn 
out to be a total novice at this, it only means you need more 
practice...which I&#39;m totally up for,&quot; she added, trying to lighten the 
mood.

Kirika didn&#39;t look convinced.

&quot;Okay Kirika, I&#39;ll teach you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Kirika asked, not sure if she heard right.

&quot;I&#39;ll teach you the basics, that way you won&#39;t feel as lost. Don&#39;t 
worry, it&#39;s less painful than it sounds.&quot;

&quot;What do I have to do?&quot;

&quot;Well, I would undress first.&quot;

Kirika unceremoniously shed her clothes.

&quot;Next, I&#39;ll tell you this big super-secret formula only the experts 
know.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;The big secret is,&quot; Mireille made sure Kirika was listening intently, 
&quot;...there is no big secret.&quot;

The younger girl&#39;s face faltered, &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you picked up, but there is no secret &#39;ooh ahh&#39; 
formula. The big trick is you think of what you want to do to your 
partner, then do it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Really.&quot;

&quot;Are you teasing me?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Kirika reached out and cupped her partner&#39;s breasts. 
Mireille nodded, and Kirika started kneading them, less crudely this 
time. She kissed one of them and made a trail up Mireille&#39;s chest, up 
her neck, and finally reached her lips.

Mireille pulled her in for a deep kiss and lowered her to the floor. 
Kirika reached up and nipped Mireille&#39;s neck and shoulder, then pulled 
her arm from under and kissed her way down until she reached her hand. 
She licked Mireille&#39;s palm and sucked her fingers and basically did 
anything to her hand that could be done by mouth.

Mireille chuckled. &quot;No wonder you like ice cream so much. You were 
having dirty little fantasies about me while eating it, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Kirika only blushed.

&quot;You were practicing on the ice cream! Don&#39;t try to deny it.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Kirika blushed heavily. &quot;Yes I was.&quot;

&quot;I never knew you had such a dirty mind. Here, let me show you how to 
use your mouth more effectively. Put it right here.&quot; Mireille pointed to 
her neck.

Kirika licked Mireille&#39;s neck, right behind her ears, causing Mireille 
to nearly collapse on her in pleasure. Suddenly Kirika had the strangest 
urge to touch Mireille where she never had before. She moved a hand 
impatiently down Mireille&#39;s body and exhaled slowly as she slipped it 
between her legs. She stroked it broadly, not knowing exactly where to 
touch but knowing it must feel as good to Mireille as it did to her. 
Mireille grabbed Kirika&#39;s hand, put it exactly where she wanted, and 
rode it, sitting up as she did. She rolled her head back and moaned 
loudly as she came.

Kirika&#39;s eyes widened in concern. &quot;Mireille, what happened? Did I hurt 
you?&quot;

Mireille snapped out of her high. &quot;Huh? No you didn&#39;t hurt me.&quot;

&quot;Then what happened?&quot;

&quot;That was a climax. It feels wonderful when it happens.&quot;

Kirika looked confused.

&quot;...Here, let me show you.&quot; Mireille pulled Kirika up and started 
rubbing her between her legs, right where Mireille had put Kirika&#39;s hand 
when she had ridden it. Kirika clung to Mireille and breathed heavily as 
Mireille kept pushing her toward the edge. She felt a wonderful feeling 
not unlike intense arousal spread from below and her mind became cloudy 
as she ground her hips against Mireille&#39;s hand, not wanting her to stop. 
Soon she could no longer think straight and her body went on autopilot. 
She buried her face in her lover&#39;s neck as her intense pleasure 
increased until Kirika felt it being released all at once, and she moved 
uncontrollably until she couldn&#39;t take it anymore. She finally stopped 
and relaxed against Mireille, slightly shaking and out of breath.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; she asked when she caught her breath, &quot;Was that a climax?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Didn&#39;t I tell you it&#39;d feel wonderful?&quot;

Kirika breathed, &quot;Yes it does....Mireille, this isn&#39;t it, is it? We 
don&#39;t have to stop now, do we?&quot;

&quot;Only if you want to.&quot;

&quot;Good. Because I don&#39;t want to.&quot; Kirika kissed Mireille and brushed the 
back of her neck, while Mirelle caressed Kirika&#39;s back. Mireille&#39;s 
hands, then her mouth, found their way to her lover&#39;s chest as the 
blonde lowered her to the floor again. Kirika closed her eyes and sighed 
happily as Mireille continued pleasing her. When Mireille was good and 
ready, she moved further down. She grabbed Kirika&#39;s thighs and went down 
on her. Kirika gasped and tugged on Mireille&#39;s hair as the blonde 
caressed her lower parts with her mouth. She soon started bucking and 
panting as she hit her peak again. She opened her eyes to find she had 
wrapped her legs around Mireille&#39;s back and sat halfway up, effectively 
trapping her partner&#39;s head.

Mirelle looked up at Kirika and said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s getting late&quot;--the sun 
had already started to set--&quot;We should eat soon.&quot; She pulled Kirika off 
her and stood up to get dressed.

&quot;No,&quot; Kirika said, &quot;Please. Let me please you like you did me.&quot; She 
stood up and pulled Mireille back down from behind.

Mireille let herself be pulled down rather easily; after all, dinner was 
the only thing making her stop, and suddenly she didn&#39;t feel all that 
hungry anymore, not with Kirika so eager to continue. She felt whatever 
tension was in her leave as her partner massaged her neck and back. She 
languidly turned over so the younger girl could get to her front.

Kirika slowly kissed her way from Mireille&#39;s neck to her breasts, where 
she lingered for what seemed like an eternity, lavishing them with as 
much attention as she could muster. She moved further down, kissing 
every step of the way, until she arrived between her thighs. She lowered 
her head tentatively. Mireille pushed Kirika&#39;s head toward her, 
prompting her to continue. Kirika shyly lapped at Mireille&#39;s womanhood, 
making the blonde throw her head back and moan. She became bolder and 
started pushing her tongue where Mireille most desired. Mireille tugged 
at Kirika&#39;s hair and started bucking. The younger woman closed her lips 
on the blonde&#39;s favorite spot and started sucking on it. Mireille moaned 
and rapidly bucked higher and higher until she sat up, pushing Kirika&#39;s 
head as close to her as possible when she hit her peak. But Kirika was 
not done yet. She continued until Mireille very quickly achieved a 
second climax. Both women fell back to the floor--Mireille gasping for 
breath--and lay still for a few seconds.

Mireille pulled Kirika up to her eye level and told her, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you 
another big secret.&quot;

Kirika looked at her. &quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;This was my first time, too.&quot;

Kirika&#39;s eyes nearly jumped out. &quot;But---but how--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m well read. I also practice. On myself.&quot;

Kirika looked at her lover, confused.

&quot;Ah..I&#39;ll have you know it&#39;s perfectly possible. In fact, that was what 
I was doing in the bath when you barged in. I was pleasing myself while 
thinking of you.&quot;

&quot;Oh...that&#39;s what those moans were then. You and...you.&quot;

Mireille chuckled. &quot;That&#39;s one way of putting it. You know, you really 
oughta try it sometime.&quot;

&quot;No thanks. I think I&#39;d rather please you.&quot;

&quot;Oh well, more fun for me.&quot; She started stroking Kirika&#39;s hand. &quot;Hey 
Kirika?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;Now you can tell those girls at school you did it with a woman,&quot; she 
said, referring to a group of girls who delighted in rubbing in Kirika&#39;s 
seemingly perpetual virginity; they didn&#39;t know Mireille was Kirika&#39;s 
girlfriend. &quot;Then just watch their faces.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Kirika knew she should feel bad about being so mean, but she 
couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the thought.

Mireille and Kirika just lay there in silence until they heard 
Mireille&#39;s stomach rumble. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Kirika said.

&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t mind. But it *is* getting late and we really must eat. 
What&#39;s say we go out to dinner to celebrate our first time?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Kirika suddenly gasped as she remembered something. &quot;Mireille, 
the groceries--&quot;

&quot;--can wait. It&#39;s not like they&#39;ll spoil or anything.&quot; Mireille finally 
got up and let out the bath water in the bathroom before joining Kirika, 
who was already getting ready to go out.</pre>
