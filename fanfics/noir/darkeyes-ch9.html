<h1>The Darkness in Their Eyes (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rtraverse.html">Rune Traverse</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Kirika turned her key in the lock, wincing as the motion made a loud, 
metallic scrape, then carefully pushed the door open, bag hanging once 
more from her shoulder. She&#39;d managed to get a better grip on herself 
during the walk upstairs, though she was still trembling and a bit 
light-headed. Almost cynically, she realized she&#39;d rather be facing down 
a hundred armed thugs than actually walking into the apartment as if 
nothing was wrong. This wasn&#39;t just scary or frightening, it was 
downright terrifying. &quot;Mirelle?&quot;

&quot;So you finally decided to come home, hmm?&quot; Mirelle&#39;s voice came quiet 
from the other side of the flat, her lean frame poised half-turned 
beside the window. The words echoed in the air, as unaffected and 
mocking as they would have been when the two of them had first met. Her 
sapphire eyes flicked toward the door, absolutely casual, then shifted 
away again like the sight of her partner meant nothing.

Kirika&#39;s heart skipped a beat, stomach tightening with a strange, almost 
warning ache. &quot;I left a note.&quot; She replied, pleased that her voice 
didn&#39;t waver. Closing the door, she dropped her bag against the wall, 
calm as she could be, though her pulse was racing. This didn&#39;t sound 
like it was going to go the way she&#39;d hoped.

&quot;Be back soon?&quot; The retort was sharper than before, laced with a hidden 
heat. Mirelle turned toward her a bit stiffly, jerky, like she was 
having problems keeping her muscles under control. Kirika could hear her 
breathing pick up, the Corsican&#39;s nostrils flaring just a bit, and she 
snorted with sarcasm. &quot;That&#39;s not a note, that&#39;s a brush off.&quot; Her gaze 
flashed fire. &quot;But I guess you were having too much fun with Alex to 
call.&quot;

And there was the opening! Kirika nearly blew the entire operation to 
give a squeal of pure glee. Oh, Alex had been right! Mirelle was 
obviously jealous &#150; so much angrier than she should have been, even 
considering the attack last night. There was something there, the 
younger woman knew it. Her throat tightened, but Kirika forced herself 
to look up with a calm, slightly surprised glance. Only her flushed 
cheeks gave her away. &quot;I &#150; met him at the art store.&quot; She said softly, 
trying as hard as she could to sound contrite. &quot;He just offered me a 
ride home.&quot;

&quot;So you kiss everybody that gives you a ride?&quot; Mirelle bit out, almost a 
growl. She threw up her hands. &quot;God, Kirika, he could be some Soldats&#39; 
punk for all you know! How can you trust him?&quot;

&quot;It was just a ride!&quot; Kirika fought not to sound guilty and failed 
spectacularly. Mirelle couldn&#39;t know she already knew Alexander was a 
member of Soldats, of course, but she still felt bad about lying. 
Straightening, the Japanese assassin moved to the center of the flat, 
keeping her eyes focused on her partner. She managed to sound both 
surprised and almost exasperated &#150; no mean feat when she wanted to just 
grab her partner and hug her. &quot;He&#39;s a friend, Mirelle. You have 
friends!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t kiss Paula or Andre!&quot; The Corsican shot back in a snarl. She 
strode forward a few steps, her boots clacking sharply on the floor 
before she jerked to a stop again. It was like she didn&#39;t dare touch 
Kirika or get too close. &quot;You promised you weren&#39;t going to see him 
again &#150; good grief, Kirika, don&#39;t you get it!&quot;

Kirika blinked. &quot;Get what! It&#39;s not like I have to tell him every piece 
of my life just because I know him.&quot; Somehow, she had a sudden sinking 
feeling the &#39;plan&#39; was about to slip sideways. This didn&#39;t sound right. 
&quot;Besides, can&#39;t I have a little fun once in a while? It&#39;s not a big 
deal!&quot;

&quot;You could get us both killed!&quot; Mirelle was having none of it, entire 
body taut and muscles singing with tension. The very air around her 
seemed ready to explode. &quot;If you want to be partners with someone, you 
can&#39;t keep putting them in danger with stupid, idiot things!&quot;

Just partners? Kirika felt her heart slam into her ribs. Mirelle wasn&#39;t 
confessing feelings &#150; she was talking about their very partnership, 
their core! A flare of rage flooded the younger girl. What the hell gave 
Mirelle the right to dictate everything between them, anyway? Why 
couldn&#39;t the Corsican treat her like an equal, a true partner and 
friend? &quot;I don&#39;t spill my guts to people just because I know them, 
Mirelle!&quot; They were now hardly a foot apart, glaring at each other. &quot;I&#39;m 
smarter than that!&quot;

&quot;You couldn&#39;t prove it by me!&quot; The blonde snapped, not quite yelling. 
&quot;Throwing away everything for some stupid little puppy crush on some 
bastard you don&#39;t know anything about sounds pretty damned stupid!&quot;

Flashpoint. Kirika wasn&#39;t sure what it was, exactly &#150; her own hurt 
feelings, the stress of the last few days, or maybe Mirelle standing 
there like the very image of the &quot;ice-cold people&quot; Alexander had 
mentioned. Fists clenched, she hurled her response straight up into the 
Corsican&#39;s face. &quot;Just because you want to cut yourself off from 
everything and stay cold and alone doesn&#39;t mean I have to!&quot;

Crack!

The sharp slapping sound of flesh meeting flesh was almost as loud as a 
gunshot in the sunlit apartment. Kirika staggered backward, cheek 
stinging viciously and eyes wide, her entire body frozen in total shock. 
The outline of a handprint stood out stark and throbbing on the golden 
skin. Mirelle, too, stood motionless, elbow still bent and right arm 
still partly outstretched, the lingering rage on her face outshone by 
stunned disbelief. For a few more moments, both stood in stunned 
tableau. Had that really just happened?

Then Kirika&#39;s eyes filled with a flood of tears. Mirelle had &#150; Mirelle 
hit &#150; it hurt! Spinning on her heels, the younger woman choked on a 
despairing cry, bolting blindly out the door at the speed only an 
assassin could match. She ignored the soft gasping sound from Mirelle&#39;s 
direction, the instinctive noise that could have been her name or a 
command to stop and wait falling on deaf ears. Her bag lay forgotten on 
the floor, but it didn&#39;t matter.

It had the pieces of her heart to keep it company, after all.



Half an hour later, Kirika slumped against the side of a building, her 
breath a hard, painful rasp that burned fire down her throat and chest. 
It was nothing compared to the whirling of her mind and the ache in her 
heart. Mirelle had hit her! Not just hit, but slapped her, hard!

I deserved it, I should never have said that, I&#39;m an awful, horrible 
partner &#150; Mirelle shouldn&#39;t love me, she couldn&#39;t love me &#150; Tears poured 
down her face. What could she do? How could she fix this horrible, 
horrible mess she&#39;d made? Who could possibly help her?

Alexander!

Straightening up, she dug shakily in her pocket. Alex had given her a 
slip of paper with his cell phone number on it before they&#39;d driven 
home. He hadn&#39;t wanted Mirelle to see it, but he&#39;d wanted to make sure 
she had some way to really get hold of him. She wouldn&#39;t call on her 
cell phone &#150; in spite of Mirelle&#39;s comment, she really wasn&#39;t that 
stupid &#150; but she did have a couple quarters in her pocket. A look around 
showed her a deserted payphone on the nearest corner; Kirika slipped 
over to it, almost a shuffle, mechanically jamming the money through the 
coin slot and holding the receiver to her ear. The seven and eight 
buttons were slightly sticky, like a little kid had touched them with 
tiny, candy-smeared fingers. Kirika didn&#39;t care.

The other end was picked up almost immediately. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;A-Alexander?&quot; Kirika sniffed and tried to control the sobs that wracked 
her lean frame. Her voice was wobbly and weak, but at the moment, she 
didn&#39;t much care about that, either. &quot;It &#150; it&#39;s &#150; &quot;

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Her friend sounded shocked and a bit baffled. &quot;Kirika, what&#39;s 
wrong? What happened?&quot;

She gasped for breath, still choking on tears. &quot;I messed everything up. 
Oh Alex, I&#39;m so stupid &#150; it&#39;s all my fault &#150; Mirelle &#150; &quot; Unable to 
finish through her weeping, she swallowed another trembling cry.

&quot;Shhhh.&quot; Alexander&#39;s soothing was firm. &quot;Where are you?&quot;

Blinking, the dark-haired young woman wiped at her face, clearing her 
gaze to find a street sign. She repeated the names to Alex, who made 
another soft, calming noise. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll be there in ten minutes. Can 
you walk two blocks down and one over? There&#39;s a caf&eacute; there.&quot;

Kirika nodded dully, then remembered Alexander couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll meet you.&quot; Alex&#39;s voice was gentle. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Kirika, we&#39;ll 
sort this out, I promise.&quot;



&quot;So she &#150; &quot; Alexander blinked, looking stunned. &quot;She actually hit you?&quot;

&quot;S-Slapped me.&quot; Kirika corrected. Her words were lifeless, every part of 
her numb. She didn&#39;t want to feel or think &#150; both of them hurt. Just 
explaining the fight to Alex had taken what little energy she&#39;d had left 
after crying her heart out. Tears still welled in her haunted eyes. &quot;I 
deserved it, Alex, I was so stupid &#150; &quot;

&quot;Hey now, stop that.&quot; Gentle hands wiped her face before hugging her 
lightly around the shoulders. &quot;Drink your soda.&quot; Alexander pushed her 
paper cup closer to her, tucking a damp lock of hair behind her ear. 
They&#39;d met at the caf&eacute; about half an hour before, where the young man 
had gotten one look at Kirika and immediately taken charge, ordering 
drinks for the two of them and steering her to a small table away from 
the other patrons. He&#39;d grabbed the sodas and a thick stack of napkins 
to dry her tears, then sat patiently while she&#39;d shakily recounted 
everything that had happened since he left. Now he leaned forward, 
elbows on the table, having dragged his chair over next to hers. His 
gaze was so direct and warm she wanted to cry all over again. &quot;It&#39;s not 
just your fault, Kirika. Mirelle didn&#39;t need to hit you just because you 
said something mean. And &#150; I guess my idea wasn&#39;t exactly the greatest, 
either.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; Kirika sucked at the straw, more because Alex 
had told her to than anything else. It was something to do &#150; motion that 
kept her pain at bay for a few seconds. A corner of Alexander&#39;s mouth 
turned up in a crooked, sheepish smile. &quot;Part of it is. I should have 
guessed she wouldn&#39;t react too well. She&#39;s got more major emotional 
problems than I realized, and they&#39;re not gonna disappear instantly. I 
think she&#39;s just still scared of her own feelings.&quot;

Kirika took a deep breath and let it out slowly. &quot;So &#150; So what do I do?&quot; 
She asked, her voice soft and very, very small. &quot;I&#39;m scared too, 
Alexander. I &#150; I don&#39;t want her to hate me.&quot;

&quot;I doubt that&#39;s possible.&quot; Alexander ruffled her bangs lightly, his gaze 
gentle. &quot;She loves you, Kirika. This proves it, really. That&#39;s the only 
reason it would hurt so much when you fight like this. You just &#150; have 
to sort out all the baggage. Love&#39;s complicated like that. At least, 
that&#39;s what all the song writers say.&quot;

He smiled, looking pleased when she smiled half-heartedly back. &quot;Come 
on.&quot; With a wider grin, he took her hand, bringing her to her feet. 
&quot;We&#39;ll go snag you some chocolate to cheer you up, and then we can grab 
some kind of present for Mirelle on the way back, okay?&quot;

Kirika nodded, following him around the tables and back out to the 
street. After the events of the last hour, she was physically and 
mentally exhausted, so tired it almost hurt to move. Part of her &#150; a 
large part &#150; just wanted to lay down and sleep. She blinked once, then 
twice, forcing herself to focus on Alex&#39;s back. It was almost a dozen 
steps before she realized she had no idea where they were going. &quot;Alex?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; His voice sounded far away, distant, and it didn&#39;t seem like he&#39;d 
slowed down any. Kirika yawned, nearly cracking her jaw as she trotted 
after him. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;I told ya, we&#39;re gonna go shopping.&quot; Alexander turned a corner, calm as 
could be, and Kirika followed obediently. A crack in the concrete 
sidewalk made her stumble; wobbling slightly, she blinked again and 
reached to steady herself on the nearest wall. Brick scraped roughly 
under her fingertips, her hand nearly missing it completely. Was she 
really that far away from the building? It looked so close. &quot;Alex &#150; &quot;

Her brain pulled to a rough halt, body following a few stagger moments 
later. Why did her voice sound so odd? It was slow, almost slurred. She 
leaned against the wall, mind whirling dizzily. &quot;What &#150; what&#39;s going on, 
Alex?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm? Oh, good, you stopped.&quot; Alex&#39;s frame seemed to waver as he turned 
around, arms folded casually across his chest. &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to 
fall and break your nose or something when you pass out. That just never 
really heals properly, you know? Not to mention you could end up 
breathing in blood and drowning.&quot;

Pass &#150; out? Kirika wanted to repeat the words, but her mouth didn&#39;t seem 
to want to work. Alexander&#39;s eyes glittered down at her like solid green 
ice. Now Kirika could feel her muscles weakening, knees and arms turning 
to heavy, shaking blobs of goo. Her brain was fogged over, random images 
and snippets of conversation flashing through her thoughts.

&quot;You really do her justice.&quot; How would Alexander know the drawings 
looked like Mirelle unless he&#39;d seen a real picture of her?

The thugs that attacked &#150; she&#39;d never seen any of them go after Alex, 
only the bodies. She&#39;d assumed they&#39;d attacked him too, but &#150; what if 
they hadn&#39;t? Why would they leave him alone?

How had Alexander made the leap to call her Soldats, even though the 
very existence of the group was secret? Why would he go against all 
training to ask her if she belonged, unless he was sure who she was?

&quot;With you as her partner and family, I can sort of see why.&quot; How could 
Alex possibly know she was Mirelle&#39;s only &#39;family?&#39;

All the plans, all the little nagging doubts and little aside comments &#150; 
how he seemed to know exactly how she felt, how Mirelle felt &#150;

&quot;You.&quot; She breathed, forcing herself to look up at him. It was so hard 
to even speak. &quot;You planned &#150; you set us up.&quot;

Alexander smiled, that Cheshire Cat grin of mischief and glee. &quot;Of 
course.&quot; He chuckled softly as her eyes fell shut again, too heavy to 
stay open. &quot;Took quite a bit of planning, but it was worth it. And of 
course, you and Mirelle helped so very much. It&#39;s so nice to deal with 
emotionally troubled people &#150; you two reacted exactly the way I knew you 
would.&quot;

Kirika gave a breathy groan, slumped against the wall. She could hear 
the odd, echoing scatto of business shoes coming closer, but she 
couldn&#39;t move or even open her eyes to see who it was. Whatever Alex had 
given her was working insanely fast. Distant and far away, she felt 
someone reach into her pocket and draw out her cell phone. &quot;Check it for 
the other&#39;s cell.&quot; A man&#39;s voice ordered. Kirika smiled faintly. He 
wouldn&#39;t find Mirelle&#39;s cell phone number listed anywhere in the 
electronic phonebook; they&#39;d memorized each others&#39; numbers for just 
this reason, as paranoid as they&#39;d thought it might be at the time. 
These bastards wouldn&#39;t get to the Corsican through her.

&quot;It isn&#39;t here.&quot; Answered another voice a few minutes later, as Kirika 
drifted in and out of consciousness. Something grabbed at her, a heavy 
hand yanking her up by a hard grip on her hair. Kirika squeaked, cursing 
her pathetic weakness and trying to bat the attacker away, but she might 
as well have been trying to roll boulders up a mountain for all the good 
it did. The second voice spoke again, even more menacing than it should 
have been due to the mess the drugs were making of her hearing. &quot;What&#39;s 
the bitch&#39;s number?&quot;

Kirika had no answer, and the man shook her like a rag doll, her body 
jerking in ugly little spasms as her twisted limbs tried to compensate 
for the movement. Teeth gritted, the Japanese assassin tried again, 
dredging up every ounce of effort she could. This time, her fingertips 
found the bare skin of an arm, and she dragged her nails across it, 
fierce satisfaction making her woozy all over again as she heard the man 
yelp in pain. The hand in her hair dragged her upright, muscles 
shrieking in nauseous protest, then released the locks to snatch her 
around the throat instead. Fingers squeezed, and Kirika choked, lungs 
wheezing while she fought for air. &quot;I asked you a question, you little 
whore!&quot;

&quot;Derrick, don&#39;t rough up the merchandise.&quot; Alexander&#39;s voice was hardly 
recognizable, calm and uninterested as though he were talking about a 
statue or a piece of furniture. Kirika wanted to spit at him, but she 
couldn&#39;t even breathe, let alone see to aim. The man holding her gave a 
snarl, and Kirika could feel him glowering for a few seconds before he 
tossed her away. Her slender form bounced off the wall to land in a heap 
on the dirty street. &quot;Besides, I know the number for the house phone. 
She&#39;ll be there.&quot;

She didn&#39;t have to see him to know he was smirking. &quot;I&#39;ll just arrange a 
little meeting, and she can get her first assignment.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sure she&#39;ll do it?&quot; The first man asked.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Alex&#39;s tone came as a wicked laugh. &quot;She&#39;d do anything to 
make sure we don&#39;t hurt her partner. Love being a many splendored thing 
and all that. Now give me the phone.&quot;

Kirika lay motionless on the pavement, tears hot enough to scald welling 
in her eyes, unable to move even an inch, and finally began to pray. Not 
for rescue &#150; she didn&#39;t deserve it. She never had, especially not now. 
No, Kirika Yuumura prayed to any god that would listen that Mirelle had 
left the apartment. That after their fight, the beautiful Corsican had 
given up on waiting for her and decided to go out. Walking, shopping, 
even on an impulsive vacation trip out to the country to teach her 
partner a lesson. It didn&#39;t matter, as long as she wasn&#39;t home.

And as the darkness finally reached up to claim her, a single tear slid 
slowly down her cheek. Mirelle, forgive me. Please, please, be gone. Be 
happy without me.



Meanwhile:

How could she have been so effing stupid?

Mirelle sighed, rubbing a tired hand across her face. She&#39;d been pacing 
up and down the length of the apartment for nearly forty-five minutes 
now, and she still couldn&#39;t wrap her mind around what had just happened. 
The kiss, the fight, the shouted words and her instinctive attack and 
Kirika&#39;s running off, all of it was unreal. Like watching something from 
a foreign film, in a language she didn&#39;t know.

She looked down at her hand with bleak, pained eyes. It looked so 
normal, just as it always did; as though it hadn&#39;t been responsible for 
something so horrifying and unforgivable. Appearances were deceiving, 
the Corsican thought morosely. She could still feel Kirika&#39;s cheek 
against her palm, the stinging weight of the slap sitting like an 
accusation on her skin. The haunted, destroyed look in Kirika&#39;s eyes as 
she stared up at her partner &#150; it made Mirelle&#39;s chest tight and her 
whole body ache.

Hell, it had taken her ten minutes to even move after Kirika had fled 
from the flat. She&#39;d managed to gasp her partner&#39;s name, but shock had 
kept her rooted until long after that small, familiar figure had 
vanished from the doorway. Even when she could move again, she hadn&#39;t 
known what to do. Run after Kirika? Then what? Even if she somehow found 
the younger woman, what would she say? What could she possibly say to 
make up for something so terribly stupid?

On autopilot, she picked up the glass she&#39;d left on the window sill and 
returned it to the kitchen, putting it and a few other utensils in the 
dishwasher. Returning to the living room, the Corsican noticed dully 
that Kirika&#39;s backpack still leaned against the wall, zippers glinting 
mockingly in the overhead lights. Crossing to it, she lifted the weight 
carefully, hands almost hesitant to touch this private piece of her 
partner&#39;s life. I&#39;m not worthy of her anymore. I shouldn&#39;t even be near 
this &#150;

Still, her fingers seemed to have a mind of their own, pulling the bag 
open and reverently lifting the stack of sketchbooks free. The one on 
top was achingly familiar, lead smudges taunting the part of her still 
faintly angry. Here was another secret. What else would Kirika have 
hidden from her in these plain pages? Setting the rest of the pads down, 
she cradled the special book to her chest, debating. Curiosity warred 
with instinctual shame. Kirika already had to hate her &#150; what was the 
English saying? In for a penny, in for a pound. She couldn&#39;t get into 
any more trouble looking, could she?

Carefully, slowly, she opened the front of the sketchbook &#150;

&#150; and felt her heart stop, the floor dropping away beneath her.

It was . . . her. The first page was a waist-up sketch in pencil, 
herself apparently standing in front of the dresser and smiling faintly, 
hand raised as though reaching to tuck a wavy lock of hair behind one 
ear. Stunned, Mirelle blinked, awed by the care and attention lavished 
on the drawing. Such complexity &#150; she&#39;d known Kirika was talented, but 
this was so far beyond anything she&#39;d ever seen. It was absolutely 
beautiful.

Turning the pages in a daze, Mirelle&#39;s shock grew. Every sketch was her. 
Mostly mechanical pencil, some inked over, but a vivid few in the 
vibrant hues of marker, colored pencil and pastels. Herself sleeping, 
making breakfast or tea, working on the computer or rolling poolballs 
across the table, laying in a sun lounger &#150; they took her breath away. 
All of them were gorgeous, infinitely detailed, made by someone who had 
obviously spent hours adoringly studying her subject. How long had 
Kirika been drawing these?

The blonde&#39;s hands shook, a fine trembling that swept straight through 
her. Slowly, she closed the sketchpad and set it atop the others, moving 
shakily to the couch. Kirika hadn&#39;t wanted her to see the book &#150; but all 
the pictures were of her &#150; why? Was Kirika afraid she would be angry? 
Was she embarrassed?

She shouldn&#39;t be. Mirelle thought numbly. They&#39;re so beautiful. I love 
them &#150; oh Kirika, you shouldn&#39;t be scared. I should never make you 
scared.

Her throat tightened, eyes stinging suspiciously. Every fiber of her 
being hurt, filled with such pain it was almost a real ache. She wanted 
so badly to have Kirika here, to hug her and hold her, that it felt like 
an absolute physical need. The thought of Kirika being frightened of her 
was a stab to her heart. She knew what it was like to be afraid of the 
person she cared for most.

No, you don&#39;t. Her subconscious broke in unexpectedly. You&#39;ve never been 
afraid of Kirika, not truly. Scared of her actions, of the weapon they 
tried to make her into maybe, but not her. Not even the first time.

The first time? Mirelle didn&#39;t quite understand. The first time she&#39;d 
really met Kirika &#150; it was at the construction site, wasn&#39;t it? What was 
she thinking of? There was something more there, the soft sounds of a 
hauntingly familiar melody teasing her senses into a longer version of 
an old memory . . .

She was a child again, eight years old, standing in the doorway of the 
veranda in a dress and shiny buckle shoes, her hair tied back with a 
ribbon and her teddy bear held in one arm. She&#39;d come looking for her 
family &#150; Mama, Papa and Jean-Claude. They had been out here, Mama and 
Papa talking, Jean-Claude reading his favorite new English book.

What she&#39;d found was a massacre. Papa sprawled on the floor, his head 
tilted funny, white shirt soaked with the crimson spreading in pools 
across the pretty tiles. Mama was on the floor, too, her skirts twisted 
askew like she fell, one blood-spattered hand flung out in front of her; 
Jean-Claude lay half under her, slumped over, his book laying forgotten 
in another of the scarlet puddles. None of them were moving, and a 
sharp, acrid smell hung over everything.

And standing in the middle of it, only a few feet away from her, was a 
little girl in overalls and a T-shirt, her shoes an odd shade of pink. 
Her small hands were wrapped around a heavy-looking gun, metal glinting 
in the light. She had a thick, dark mop of hair and golden tanned skin, 
her features delicate and pretty. And her eyes &#150;

The eyes were beautiful, soft brown with highlights of warm red. Their 
gazes locked, staring into each others&#39; faces, and Mirelle was surprised 
to realize she felt absolutely no fear. She knew, even as a child, that 
this girl had killed her family. After all, she wasn&#39;t stupid; her 
parents and brother were obviously dead, shot by the gun the other child 
held. But caught in those amazing eyes, something deeper than rational 
thought was convinced this girl would never hurt her.

The girl had lowered her hands already while they watched each other. 
Now she stowed the gun in her pocket, its heavy weight dragging at her 
pant leg, and looked up with an odd, solemn, almost shy expression. Her 
voice was quiet, musical as she spoke in English. &quot;You &#150; dropped your 
teddy bear.&quot;

Stepping forward with catlike grace, she stooped and picked up the toy 
where it had tumbled forgotten to the ground, only inches from the 
spreading lake of crimson. She held it out by one plush arm, and a 
slightly surprised Mirelle reached out to take the other, tucking her 
stuffed companion in the crook of her elbow once more. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She 
replied softly in the same language. She didn&#39;t want her bear bloody, 
after all. The fact that it was the blood of her parents and brother &#150; 
almost her entire world &#150; didn&#39;t seem to truly register yet.

Looking up, she saw the child&#39;s gaze track across the floor, focusing on 
the silver pocket watch that had been her Papa&#39;s. It had fallen open 
when it hit the tiles, playing its pretty little melody into the deadly 
quiet. Mirelle leaned forward and scooped it up, the round weight 
cradled in her small free palm. After a few seconds, she held it out 
gravely. Somehow, she knew. &quot;This &#150; it&#39;s yours now, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The girl nodded, as though the question weren&#39;t odd at all. Reaching 
out, she carefully took the open watch, her fingers brushing Mirelle&#39;s 
for a few strangely intense seconds. They stayed like that for a long 
moment, hands touching; then, almost reverently, the dark-haired child 
closed the lid, an audible click cutting off the soft music. &quot;Thank 
you.&quot; She whispered, tucking the metal gently into one of her other 
pockets. Her gaze returned to Mirelle, and there was an edge of warmth 
there now, shy and soft sweetness just beneath the surface. She wasn&#39;t 
smiling, not exactly . . . but she wasn&#39;t not smiling, either. Whatever 
the emotion, her eyes glowed with it.

Mirelle found herself not-smiling back, just a little &#150; then the sound 
of running feet turned her head &#150; her uncle&#39;s face appeared, his curly 
golden hair disheveled, eyes wide with horror and panic &#150; the flash of 
sunlight on a gun barrel, then on a blade, while a strong arm yanked her 
backward &#150; and the young girl spun and leapt away, the undone strap of 
her overalls swinging in a glittering arch &#150;

Back in the present, Mirelle gaped, shocked. She hadn&#39;t remembered all 
of that before &#150; until their trial at the Manor, her memories had ended 
when she opened the door to the veranda and saw the death within. Since 
then, bits and pieces after that moment had flickered back into her 
thoughts, but nothing that clear or vivid. Somehow, the painful stress 
of the last few days &#150; especially the last hour &#150; must have brought it 
crashing back to the surface.

And you still never feared her. You knew she would never hurt you.

Her subconscious, soft and serious for once, was right enough to make 
Mirelle groan as she flopped back on the couch cushions. No, she had 
never feared Kirika, not even when she stood over the bodies of her 
family and stared face to face with their killer. Not even when she&#39;d 
arrived at the Manor and fought the weapon they&#39;d forged her partner 
into, knowing in the back of her mind and deep in her heart that Kirika 
would either return to her or kill her. Somehow, beyond anything 
intelligent or logical, she knew for certain Kirika would never hurt her 
intentionally.

Unintentionally, though, it felt like she tried to drive a spike through 
my heart. The blonde Corsican sighed, her mind and emotions once again 
in a whirl. Seeing Kirika kissing Alexander had made her impossibly 
angry; infuriated, really, unable to think clearly and fighting for 
every ounce of control she managed to salvage. She didn&#39;t quite 
understand why, only that it made her want to scream and rant and throw 
things across the room in a fit like she hadn&#39;t had since she was a very 
small child. Then hearing those sharp, painful words thrown from her 
partner&#39;s beautiful mouth &#150; it had been like pouring gasoline on a 
raging fire.

But she still didn&#39;t understand how she could have been angry enough to 
lash out at Kirika that way.

Boy, you really are emotionally dense. Her inner voice mocked. If it 
could have, Mirelle had a feeling her subconscious would be rolling its 
eyes. The only reason you slapped her was because your pissed-off pride 
was stronger than your passion right then. You had to touch her &#150; how 
you did it was up in the air.

What! The Corsican yelped in surprise, sapphire eyes wide, forgetting 
for a moment she was arguing with herself. I did not want &#150; there was 
nothing passionate about it!

Oh really? The reaction was a sarcastic snort. You don&#39;t think so?

&quot;Just because you want to cut yourself off from everything and stay cold 
and alone doesn&#39;t mean I have to!&quot;

Her hand shot out, aimed at that familiar, furious face. But instead of 
a slap, her fingers curled around a pointed chin, pulling Kirika&#39;s 
slender frame hard against hers. Mirelle kissed her hungrily, almost a 
little desperately, heart thundering and intoxicated with the feel of 
the younger woman&#39;s lips. It wasn&#39;t fair that anyone else would ever 
touch this gorgeous skin, this wonderful body. Kirika was hers! Hers, 
not some idiot from an art store that had no idea how beautiful and 
complex she really was. &quot;Mine.&quot; She breathed, unable to manage a full 
sentence.

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; Kirika half-moaned in agreement, her voice trailing to a soft 
whimper as Mirelle sucked at her lower lip, drawing it into her mouth 
and teasing it with her tongue. The blonde wrapped her arms around the 
smaller girl&#39;s waist, pressing them tighter together. It felt so right, 
so very good &#150;

Mirelle&#39;s eyes fluttered, breath hitching in her chest as the fantasy 
flashed in her mind. It took quite a few minutes for her brain to put 
together a coherent denial. I &#150; I would never &#150; I wouldn&#39;t kiss Kirika! 
That&#39;s insane!

Her subconscious sighed. Dense, opinionated, emotionally-stunted idiot. 
You wouldn&#39;t put up with this shit from anyone else, but you sure 
overlook it when it&#39;s your own faults.

With a growl, the blonde Corsican slumped onto her back, lying across 
the couch and throwing one arm over her eyes. This was all so messed up 
&#150; Kirika, her feelings, Mirelle&#39;s own conflicted feelings. It 
completely, utterly sucked.

Quiet filled the room, a silence that was more uncomfortable than it 
should have been. For a few heartbeats, her pulse was all she heard. 
Then, softly, a familiar chiming noise began ringing through the air. 
Ching, ching ching ching.

Mirelle stayed motionless, forearm still pressed to her eyes. She didn&#39;t 
want to answer the damned cell phone. Hell, she didn&#39;t even want to 
move. The world could just go the hell away for all she cared.

But if it was Kirika calling &#150;

With a glower, the blonde sat up and reached for her cell, not even 
bothering to look at the front screen before flipping it open. Her 
greeting came tired and pained. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;What the fuck did you do to warrant a hitman?&quot; Andre&#39;s slightly 
panicked voice in her ear was loud enough to deafen her. Mirelle 
blinked, angst retreating a bit in confusion. &quot;Andre?&quot;

&quot;Who the hell do you think it is!&quot; The detective demanded. &quot;Never mind, 
I don&#39;t want to know. I really don&#39;t want to know. What the hell did you 
do?&quot;

Surprised in a dull sort of way, Mirelle decided not to point out he&#39;d 
just contradicted himself. Andre very rarely cursed; anything that had 
him this worked up was probably important. &quot;Calm down, Andre. What 
hitman are you talking about?&quot;

She could hear Andre give a low growl on the other end of the line, his 
teeth grinding together before he managed a deep breath to calm himself. 
&quot;I just got a bit more intel on the criminal group Garrison&#39;s gotten 
involved with. They&#39;re bad news, Mirelle, and the rumor is that they&#39;ve 
got some big plans for you and Kirika. One of their people is already 
here in Paris. Are you hearing me?&quot;

&quot;I get it.&quot; Mirelle sighed. The last thing she even wanted to think 
about right now was Garrison and his idiocy. Still, it was &#150; sweet, she 
guessed, that Andre cared enough to warn them. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve actually got a picture. I&#39;m e-mailing it to you now.&quot; The 
detective spoke low and tense, clicking in the background indicating his 
swift typing. Mirelle rolled her eyes in spite of herself, wishing she 
hadn&#39;t picked up at all. &quot;This kid&#39;s supposed to be bad news. Smuggling, 
robbery, armed robbery, assault &#150; a full sheet, as the Americans say.&quot;

The laptop beeped, and Mirelle sighed, standing and moving in front of 
the monitor. Sure enough, her mail icon was blinking. Rolling the mouse, 
she double-clicked the envelope image, waiting patiently for the picture 
to load. &quot;There&#39;s even some unproven extortion and murder charges. I 
still don&#39;t know how the New York cops got this shot &#150; &quot;

Mirelle didn&#39;t answer, glancing up as the color snapshot finally flashed 
onto the screen. The cell phone slipped from her suddenly nerveless 
fingers, falling to the floor with a clattering thump. Andre&#39;s voice, 
distant and strained, blared questioningly from the small earpiece. 
&quot;Mirelle? Mirelle, are you listening to me? Are you still there? 
Mirelle!&quot;

The blonde Corsican didn&#39;t make a move to retrieve it, body frozen in 
shock and stunned, creeping horror. Sapphire eyes stared unblinking at 
the image before her. She knew that lean frame, that brown hair and wood 
green eyes. And that face, especially that aristocratic face. She&#39;d seen 
it only an hour before, tilted down to look at Kirika after the soft 
kiss that had started this mess. &quot;Alexander.&quot; She breathed, the name 
like a low rush of fire. Her heart smoldered, embers fanning with the 
beginnings of all-consuming rage.

Alexander &#150; this was all his fault. He was a murderer, another assassin, 
a killer. And now Kirika was out there somewhere with him.

As if on cue, the house phone rang shrilly. Smooth and strangely calm, 
Mirelle reached out and lifted the cordless handset to her ear. &quot;Hello.&quot;

A younger male voice spoke, only three short sentences. &quot;Barns and Royal 
Warehouses in two hours. We have her. Don&#39;t be late.&quot;

The other end of the line disconnected, and Mirelle pushed the end 
button with her thumb, then carefully set it back in the cradle. Andre 
was still speaking, yelling really, but it didn&#39;t matter. It was far 
away, not part of her reality anymore. Her eyes burned, sapphire flames 
lit from within. They had Kirika. They had taken what was hers.

They were all dead. Every last one of them.

And THIS is why no one should like Alexander. Asshat. (smirk) Though 
trust me when I say everyone will like him even less in the next 
chapter.

Another sidenote: The &#39;memory&#39; Mirelle has of her family&#39;s death and 
Kirika&#39;s coming into possession of the pocketwatch is taken from the 
doujinshi. Yeah, I know, I swore I wouldn&#39;t mix the two, but it&#39;s such 
an awesome memory I wanted to include it anyway.</pre>
