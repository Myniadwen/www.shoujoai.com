<h1>When a Job Goes Wrong (part 14 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cavalyn.html">Cavalyn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/jobwrong-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>As the two of them trudged through the streets of New York Mireille 
could not help her mind wandering to her small partner who silently 
walked next to her. The small Asian girl seemed very subdued, her face 
quiet and yet troubled, as if something was weighing heavily on her. 
Mireille knew what it was.

She too did not want to kill Laura Marcis, despite her earlier jealous 
anger, the woman was not all that bad. Besides, jealousy was never 
something to kill someone over.

But a job was a job. When it came down to the bullet all targets would 
be family to someone, loved ones, mothers, fathers. The assassin 
couldn&#39;t choose his target, only ensure that their passing was a 
painless one.

Perhaps she should have left Kirika behind?

Not that Kirika would have allowed herself to be left behind.

What am I supposed to do? Kill Laura, get the cure and live with an 
apathetic Kirika, or leave Laura and try and fight the cure from that 
company? Why is there never an easy answers?

Laura Marcis lived on the outskirts of New York, in a quaint small house 
bought from her and her husband&#39;s joint earnings. A nice place, with two 
floors and a good view of the land outside the bustling city. A family 
home.

Just to make Mireille and Kirika feel that little bit more guilty.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; Kirika whispered in a hurt voice, her eyes glistening. 
Mireille nodded that she felt the same, but this had to be done.

Why?

To get the antidote for Kirika obviously.

There are other paths to get it. Like you said, just steal it.

Too difficult.

You&#39;d kill a family just to make things easier for yourself?

There is no justice in necessity. But it IS necessary.

... Liar...

----------

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Laura breathed as she opened the door of her house. Kirika 
looked up at her, ashamed at the shock on the woman&#39;s face, and even 
more ashamed at what she was here to do.

&quot;Who is it mummy?&quot; A small feminine voice asked. Kirika swallowed 
uneasily. No, no no. Please don&#39;t let this be happening. Despite her 
wishes a small girl bounded up to them and looked curiously at Kirika 
from behind her mother&#39;s leg. Kirika whimpered.

Cute was the only word. Cute, happy and cute. Behind Kirika, Mireille 
seemed to take a deep breath as well.

&quot;Laura, can we talk? Alone?&quot; The psychiatrist looked down at her 
daughter and then back up at them again. Even though they made no 
threatening move, the woman seemed to sense what they were here for.

&quot;Sophie, go inside with daddy and tell him I&#39;ll be back later.&quot; The 
small girl nodded happily, smiling with a small dimple and rushing off 
to do her mother&#39;s bidding.

&quot;She&#39;s a lovely child.&quot; Laura spoke to them this time, her smile 
somewhat forced.

&quot;I assume my brother sent you?&quot; She asked, this time with a serious and 
grim face. Mireille shrugged.

&quot;I don&#39;t know who gave the contract, it&#39;s from a pharmaceutical company 
in the city.&quot;

Kirika wondered why Mireille was telling all of this to Laura. Although 
he didn&#39;t want her to die, surely it would have been easier, and kinder, 
to grant her a quick and painless death? Instead of allowing her all 
this time to realise how much she would miss her family.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s him alright. He owns it. They make drugs and sell them, 
but they also make illegal drugs to be sold on the black market. I found 
out about their latest drug and told him not to make it or I&#39;d tell the 
cops... I guess... he still wants the power it&#39;d bring him.&quot;

So family was killing off family? Just because one woman was trying to 
obey the law... Kirika felt sicker and sicker. Why was their never any 
justice? Why were they always the bad guys?

&quot;We&#39;re sorry Laura,&quot; Mireille began, her tone regretful, &quot;But if you 
tell us what the drug is, then we can at least inform the authorities. 
At least then you&#39;re brother won&#39;t get away with it.&quot; Not much 
consolation.

&quot;I guess...&quot; Laura answered hesitantly. She had tried to be brave, but 
she was shivering now, and her voice was cracking. Kirika hated herself, 
they had reduced this kind woman to a shivering wreck, and would soon 
kill her. &quot;It&#39;s called Merophoxyll...it...Mireille?&quot; Kirika turned to 
look at the blonde too.

Her face was frozen, not in shock, but purest anger. Kirika&#39;s eyes went 
to the Walther, which was being squeezed in a tight grip as Mireille 
tried to control her anger.

&quot;Mireille..&quot; Kirika began, &quot;What is it?&quot; Why was she so angry?

&quot;Damn them...&quot; Mireille whispered between gritted teeth. &quot;Damn them, 
damn them, DAMN THEM!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Kirika asked again, not liking the way Mireille was going.

&quot;Merophoxyll, as in the lust drug?&quot; Mireille asked Laura dangerously. 
The psychiatrist stood a little taller, apparently sensing that she 
might be spared. Kirika hoped so.

&quot;You know of it?&quot; Laura asked incredulously. Mireille nodded, Kirika had 
no idea what she was on about.

&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot; She spoke, but was ignored.

&quot;How?&quot; Mireille made a strange motion with her eyes then nodded to 
Kirika. Kirika felt her irritation mount. What the hell was she on 
about?

&quot;What? What is it?&quot; She demanded, Laura looked at her with a face full 
of pity.

&quot;Oh you poor girl, that was so cruel of them.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s...&quot; Laura added, Mireille nodded, &quot;For you?&quot; Again Mireille 
nodded. Kirika tried to keep her face from glowering as they excluded 
her from the conversation.

&quot;Will someone tell me what you&#39;re on about?&quot; She asked, again she 
received no answer.

&quot;So... you&#39;re not going to kill me?&quot; The question was asked with a hint 
of dread, but Mireille&#39;s smile soon calmed her.

&quot;No, I guess not. I hope you have a happy life with your family.&quot; 
Laura&#39;s face lit up as she nodded furiously.

&quot;I will, I will. Oh, by the way, my brother&#39;s name is Edwin. Edwin 
Marcis.&quot; Kirika gasped.

&quot;That name! Mireille, that&#39;s the name of the man who talked to you!&quot; The 
blonde&#39;s face was wracked with confusion for a moment before she 
suddenly remembered, her face twisting in dislike.

&quot;I knew something about him didn&#39;t ring true. He kept saying that he was 
not the boss of the organisation, but he arranged our hits.&quot; Kirika 
nodded, knowing that she was smiling foolishly, she didn&#39;t care if they 
now had to fight their way through a criminal organisation, at least 
this time they would be killing people who deserved it.

&quot;Come on Kirika. We&#39;re going to pay Mr Edwin a visit.&quot; Kirika nodded as 
she fell in step with her partner.

&quot;Edwin lives in the building, he has his own quarters there so he 
doesn&#39;t have to leave his business! Good luck, and destroy Merophoxyll!&quot; 
Laura cried out to them as they left.

Laura faintly heard Kirika&#39;s voice as she went back inside to see her 
husband and her daughter again.

&quot;Are you going to tell me what Merophoxyll is then or not?&quot;
