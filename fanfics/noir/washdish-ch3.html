<h1>Washing the Dishes (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakablonde.html">Bakablonde</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/washdish-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Two weeks have passed, possibly the happiest two weeks of my life. I&#39;m 
her partner in the classes, much to Anton&#39;s dismay- I can&#39;t help but 
smile as I watch him look on. And at night- I&#39;ve never looked forward to 
our evening tea as much as I do now. Because afterwards, when Mireille 
does the dishes- I get to hold her. She&#39;s right, it&#39;s silly. But it&#39;s 
the best thing in the world. I don&#39;t drool on her anymore, now that I&#39;m 
off the pain pills and not so tired. It&#39;s funny, now I get this weird 
surge of energy when I hold her, and even though she&#39;s right there, I 
want her to be closer. It doesn&#39;t make sense but I find her on my mind, 
and on my drawing paper, sketch after sketch, as I sit at the park. 
Suddenly I have a thought, a bold thought, dare I ask her?

---------- 

&quot;Pose for you?&quot; her voice is full of disbelief.

I nod, trying to get up my courage for the real question. We&#39;re in the 
kitchen, and I&#39;m almost finished with the tea. I pour out a cup for each 
of us.

&quot;Nude.&quot; I try to say as calmly as possible, handing her the cup.

&quot;What!&quot; she exclaims, mouth open in absolute shock.

&quot;Please.&quot; I choke out, unable to form any sort of logical argument. Her 
open mouth snaps shut and she whirls about, storming out of the kitchen.

I follow her, head down, and sit at the table in uncomfortable silence. 
How dare I- to be so selfish, to ask such a thing? All I know is I want 
to be closer, to know her, and drawing her, drawing her exposed, somehow 
excites me. I suppose I&#39;m so awful to even think it. Maybe she will 
never speak to me again. I feel like crying. I feel her looking at me, 
but can&#39;t face her. I don&#39;t want to see that glare- the one she used to 
give me, that hurt so much. To think that I brought this on myself...I 
put my hands over my face, distraught. Please don&#39;t look at me like 
that, Mireille. I can&#39;t take it. Once again, I am some sort of freak.

She gets up from the table, tea untouched, and goes back into the 
kitchen. She bangs around in the kitchen, and I hear several cupboard 
doors slam.

I try hard not to let the tears out, but a few get by and I wipe them 
off. I hear her coming back out and suddenly a wine bottle slams onto 
the table. Wordless, she pours a glass for herself, and I remove my 
hands, watching her from the corner of my eye. She takes a few sips, 
ignoring me.

&quot;Drink your tea before it gets cold.&quot; she snaps at me.

I gulp and nod. She gets up and brings back a magazine and flips through 
it. We sip in silence. I steal a few looks her way, relieved to see that 
she&#39;s no longer furious. I guess I can live with the cold treatment for 
a while.

I finish my tea sadly, suspecting that I won&#39;t be able to hold her 
tonight. I sigh and push back the chair to get up.

&quot;Are you finished?&quot; she asks coolly.

&quot;Yes. Um, you don&#39;t want your tea?&quot; I venture softly, grateful she&#39;s 
even speaking to me.

&quot;Then go get your sketchbook.&quot; she states quietly, turning another page. 
I freeze in disbelief. Is this real? Did I just hear her say-

&quot;Are you going to draw me or not?&quot; she smacks the magazine shut, looking 
at me.

&quot;Yes!&quot; I squeak out, feeling a nervous wave run over my body.

It&#39;s all I can do to remain calm as I rummage through my stuff, getting 
ready. A pencil stabs my hand, and instead of grimacing, I smile. I&#39;m 
awake. This is real.

----------

&quot;Okay.&quot; I pant out, returning to the table. She&#39;s opened the magazine 
again and is still sitting down. A sudden fear that she&#39;s changed her 
mind shoots through me. I stand behind her, waiting, my anxiety 
building.

&quot;Will anyone see these drawings?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Promise me no one will see them.&quot; she still makes no move to leave the 
table.

&quot;Of course not. I would never do that.&quot; I say softly. I know they will 
be precious to me, like gold. I won&#39;t share them with anyone.

She stands, and puts her hands on the chair, not facing me.

&quot;You know I&#39;ve never done anything like this before.&quot; she almost sounds 
nervous. &quot;So...I&#39;m just going to take my top off and see how it goes.&quot;

She&#39;s more talking to herself than me at this point, so I just grunt in 
agreement. I stand mesmerized behind her, watching her carefully remove 
her shirt, and giving a tug to the back of her bra, loosening it and 
twisting it to her front. She deposits it on the table, and picks up her 
glass of wine.

&quot;Standing by the window ok?&quot; she asks, and walks away before I answer. I 
set my stuff down on the table next to her clothes. All of a sudden I&#39;m 
almost afraid to look at her. I situate myself in the chair, ready my 
pad, and look up.

&quot;Mireille...&quot; I whisper. She&#39;s so beautiful. I find my eyes dropping to 
her bare breasts and I suddenly get a shiver down my spine.

&quot;What is it?&quot; she crosses her arms defensively. She takes another sip 
from her glass. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this for you. What would my 
parents think?&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;re the most beautiful model in the world.&quot; I blurt out, and I 
see a strange look cross her face.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I stammer out again, suddenly not knowing what to say. 
There&#39;s an awkward silence on my part, then she breaks into a smile. 
&quot;I&#39;ll bet you say that to all your models.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the only model for me.&quot; I answer quietly, and I feel the color 
creep into my cheeks.

&quot;Really...I hope no one can see through these shutters.&quot; she murmurs, 
cracking one open and looking out.

&quot;Um, Mireille?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; she closes the shutter and takes another sip, looking at me.

&quot;Can you hold still?&quot;

&quot;Bossy.&quot; she huffs, but is smiling. &quot;Anything else?&quot;

&quot;Put your arms down.&quot; I say softly, and am surprised to see her blush 
slightly. She licks her lips a little, then slowly drops her arms. Her 
eyes close and she clenches her glass.

&quot;I feel so naked.&quot; her whisper is so low I almost don&#39;t hear it. I begin 
to draw, mesmerized by each line of her body.

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful, Mireille.&quot; I whisper back to her. I don&#39;t know 
whether or not she hears me, her eyes stay shut. I take this chance to 
really look at her, to admire her now in a way I never have before. A 
small prayer escapes my lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever let this moment end...&quot;</pre>
