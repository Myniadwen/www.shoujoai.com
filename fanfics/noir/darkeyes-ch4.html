Standing ankle-deep in the springy grass of the canal bank, Kirika 
glanced at the area around her and smiled slightly, pleased. Warm, 
early-morning sun fell all around, gleaming along the shimmering blue 
waters and dancing along the greenery underfoot; the sky was perfectly 
clear, hardly more than a few cottony, puffball clouds floating lazily 
overhead. Aside from a few people lounging and walking along behind her, 
this side of the canal was almost empty. On the other side, a boutique 
mall would provide people for watching and drawing. It was an excellent 
place to do some impromptu sketches.

Only for a few hours, though. Mirelle&#39;s plane was due at the airport in 
the early evening, and it would take her about forty-five minutes to get 
home after that. Kirika had figured it out in detail to make sure her 
plans for the night went right. She&#39;d checked and double-checked each 
recipe in her menu, cleaned the apartment &#150; not that there was much to 
clean, really &#150; and written up a list of everything she could possibly 
need. After a little bit of relaxing time, she would make the rounds of 
the grocery stores, then head home and whip up the welcome-home dinner. 
She&#39;d already baked the pies yesterday.

Of course, she&#39;d also seen Alexander Hollinder yesterday. Her petite 
face took on a thoughtful cast. She had stopped at the new art store to 
get a few extra supplies, and he&#39;d been inside, chatting with one of the 
male employees. It had felt &#150; odd, to see him. As if she were breaking 
some sort of unwritten rule. She&#39;d made sure he hadn&#39;t seen her, paying 
for her things quickly while he was distracted with his conversation, 
but it had made her feel almost guilty. It wasn&#39;t his fault she couldn&#39;t 
get close to anyone.

Besides, Kirika reminded herself, he has a girlfriend, that &#39;Lisa&#39; from 
the day before. All he was doing was making polite conversation with 
another artist who was nice enough to give him his drawing back, and she 
was irritated. He probably wouldn&#39;t want to talk with me again.

Not that she minded, really. It would have just been nice, having 
someone she could talk to, especially about things Mirelle wouldn&#39;t 
understand.

Settling herself in the grass, Kirika opened her backpack and removed 
one of her newer sketchbooks, propping it on her knees and setting her 
small bag of pencils beside her. The backpack itself flopped over just a 
bit, contents fanning slightly out the opening, but that was alright. 
She knew she could stick everything back inside quick enough if it came 
to that. Leaning back against a good-sized rock, she brushed her bangs 
from her eyes, the corners of her lips curving up in a faint smile. So, 
who should I sketch first?

--------

&quot;Kirika!&quot;

The pencil in Kirika&#39;s hand twitched slightly, leaving a hardly 
noticeable squiggle in the dusty red outline of a building that rose 
half-finished from the paper on her lap. Instinctively, she dropped the 
drawing tool, her other hand moving behind her toward the Beretta tucked 
at the small of her back. A half-second later, though, she was startled 
to recognize the male voice. &quot;Alexander?&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; A shadow fell across the grass as the young man came up beside 
her, hands stuffed in the pockets of his oversized sweatshirt and a 
cheerful, faintly sheepish grin on his face. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to scare 
you. I was just surprised &#150; I saw you at the store yesterday, but by the 
time I finished talking with Luke, you were gone. Mind if I sit down?&quot;

Kirika shook her head mutely, too surprised to refuse, and Alex sat down 
in the grass on the opposite side as her backpack, long legs sprawling a 
bit atop the delicate blades. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to miss you again.&quot; He 
grinned at her in a friendly, innocent sort of way. &quot;That picture turned 
out so much better with the pencils you picked. I&#39;d show you, but I 
didn&#39;t bring it with me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright.&quot; Kirika ducked her head, smiling back just slightly in 
spite of herself. Truth be told, Alexander reminded her more than a 
little of Milosh, but in a good way. The young artist was like a happy 
puppy, amusing and playful without any predatory instincts just yet. 
Still, she had to ask. &quot;Was your girlfriend irritated with you?&quot;

&quot;Girlfriend?&quot; When she looked up, Alex was gaping at her, eyes wide and 
stunned. After a few seconds, he appeared to understand, bursting into 
laughter. &quot;You mean Lisa? She&#39;s not my girlfriend, Kirika &#150; she&#39;s my 
cousin.&quot;

Cousin? Kirika immediately felt like an idiot. Alexander grinned, 
patting her elbow &#150; and apparently missing the flash of discomfort on 
her face at the contact. &quot;She and my Aunt moved to England a few years 
back, but we grew up together, and they visit three or four times a 
year. I forget how impatient she can be sometimes.&quot; He shook his head. 
&quot;No wonder you didn&#39;t stop to talk yesterday. If I had that scowl 
pointed at me, I&#39;d be scared, too.&quot;

So that was what he thought, that she&#39;d avoided him to keep from 
angering his cousin. Well, it was as good an explanation as any, really. 
Though why he really cared was a mystery to the Japanese assassin. 
Still, the idea that someone besides Mirelle did care made her feel 
oddly bold, stronger and more confident than usual. A sparrow winged its 
way gracefully down to the grass in front of them, hopping slightly on 
its two thin legs as it searched for seeds and bugs in the dirt. Caught 
by the image, Kirika smiled faintly, flipping to a clean page in her 
sketchbook. &quot;So &#150; so what brought you here?&quot; She asked, voice quiet and 
shy.

&quot;It&#39;s my favorite place to sketch.&quot; The young man admitted, arms folded 
casually. &quot;Actually, sketch and people-watch. It&#39;s a hobby of mine, 
especially in the morning.&quot; He grinned, leaning back against the 
boulder. &quot;So what about you?&quot;

&quot;Just some new sketches.&quot; Kirika blushed slightly, motioning toward her 
backpack and the opposite bank with her free hand. Her right hand, now 
holding a deep brown pencil, was busy sketching out the rounded outlines 
of the sparrow&#39;s sleek, feathered body. &quot;I was looking for someplace 
different today.&quot;

&quot;Really? Can I see?&quot; Alex looked avidly at the fan of sketchpads spread 
on her other side, one eyebrow raised. Kirika hesitated for a moment. It 
couldn&#39;t hurt to let him see her art. There was nothing really he could 
learn about her from it, anyway. Slowly, she nodded. With a gleeful 
grin, her fellow artist snagged the top book and set it in his own lap, 
carefully opening the pages. &quot;Wow &#150; this is incredible. Did you use 
paint here on this shadow, or regular ink? You&#39;re kidding, a calligraphy 
brush? I&#39;d never think of that. Have you ever tried eraser smudging?&quot;

The conversation took off swiftly from there. Alexander was surprisingly 
knowledgeable about different techniques, and he seemed interested and 
impressed by Kirika&#39;s various dabbles. Even better, he didn&#39;t ask 
anything about her personally, although he did volunteer some bits and 
pieces of information on his own life. The sun rose high, burning off 
the faint chill that still clung to the pavement below; people arrived, 
shopped, and left while the two of them chatted, pausing occasionally to 
sketch something that caught their eye. By the time Kirika glanced away 
again, she was startled to realize it was half-past noon. Her face 
filled with dismay. &quot;Oh no!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Alex frowned, one of her sketchbooks still balanced and 
open on his knees as he compared one of her techniques to his own 
attempt. Kirika snapped the pad in her hand shut, hurrying to gather up 
her supplies. &quot;My par &#150; &quot; She managed to catch herself before finishing 
that sentence awkwardly, thank goodness. &quot;My best friend, my roommate. 
She&#39;s coming back today from a business trip, and I&#39;m making a special 
dinner.&quot;

&quot;And I made you late for it.&quot; Looking instantly apologetic, the young 
man closed her book and dropped it into the open pouch of her backpack, 
hopping to his feet. One hand brushed absently at the back of his jeans 
to clear away any dirt. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kirika.&quot; Suddenly he brightened. &quot;I 
know! Have you ever ridden on a moped?&quot;

&quot;Once or twice.&quot; Kirika replied absently, tugging the zippers shut. 
Mirelle did have a scooter, and they&#39;d used it a few times, although not 
recently. Alexander grinned, motioning for her to follow him. &quot;Come on, 
then! I have a spare helmet for Lisa, and she&#39;s about your size. We can 
hit the store and get you home in time to spare!&quot;

Kirika paused for a few seconds, staring at the young man&#39;s lean back as 
he strode toward the street. Trained assassin instinct warred with her 
sharp desire to make things perfect for Mirelle&#39;s homecoming. It was 
absolutely stupid &#150; but would it be more foolish to refuse at this 
point? Slinging her bag over her shoulder, she hurried after him, steps 
light and swift. This really would help, and it was nice of him to 
offer. &quot;Thank you, Alex.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot; He smiled over his shoulder as they reached a gleaming, 
deep blue two-wheeler parked near the curb. The expression was almost 
shy. &quot;It&#39;s my fault anyway. But it&#39;s really sweet of you to make a 
special dinner for her.&quot;

Now Kirika smiled, a soft, gentle tugging of her lips while she pulled 
on the dark helmet. &quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s special, too.&quot;

---------

Thank god that&#39;s over.

Mirelle paused as she stepped from the air-conditioned lobby and into 
the bright early-evening sun, tilting her head back to feel the gentle 
caress of warmth against her face. Around her, straggling travelers 
trickled past, clutching at their tote bags, suitcases, backpacks and 
rolling luggage like anchors to the worlds they left behind; some headed 
inside, ready for parts unknown, while others were moving back out into 
the busy chaos of the Parisian streets. Mirelle could have cared less. 
She was home, back where she belonged.

Never again would she take a job like this last one. It wasn&#39;t 
necessarily that the hit itself had gone wrong. On the contrary, the 
idiots at the &#39;retreat&#39; had been hardly any more challenge than 
children. She&#39;d known it was going to be a piece of cake when she&#39;d been 
able to pass off her bruised arm as the result of a mugging by a black 
assailant in the city. After that, it had been a simple matter of 
gaining the target&#39;s trust, getting him to a place on his own, and 
finishing him off. The whole operation hadn&#39;t taken more than three 
days, all told.

No, the problem hadn&#39;t been anything logistical, but strangely personal. 
Kirika had been on her mind constantly ever since she&#39;d left the 
apartment. In the taxi, on the plane, at the retreat information 
seminar, and especially in her room at night, flashes of her dark-haired 
shadow had flitted through her thoughts. She&#39;d wondered what her partner 
was doing, whether she was alright, whether Soldats had kept their word 
and left her alone. Whether Kirika was missing her as much as she missed 
the little Japanese. Sleeping had been an almost painful chore. The bed 
seemed somehow too large, even though she knew it was smaller than the 
one she shared with Kirika; the sheets had been too cold, rough and 
empty without the usual lean warmth curled safe on the mattress next to 
her.

The first morning, she&#39;d woken with her eyes aching and gritty, body 
curled tight around one of the pillows and hugging it to her chest. 
Mirelle shifted uncomfortably, remembering the faint damp patch beneath 
her cheek, the lingering taste of saltwater on her lips. She&#39;d managed 
to pass off the redness with jet lag, but it had been slightly unnerving 
to think she had been crying in her sleep. It was as if her professional 
cool had been cut in half without her partner at her side.

And the second night? A faint blush blossomed on her pale cheeks. 
Although she didn&#39;t remember much of her dreams, she knew Kirika had 
been in them. The scattered fragments she did recall, though, were 
definitely not normal. Hot, panting breath spilling across her neck, 
well-clipped nails scratching sharply down her bare back, the warm 
weight of a slender, familiar body lying over hers, pressing against 
hers. Her own hands sliding across smooth, golden-tan skin, fingers 
tangled in that thick, silky mane &#150; the close, dizzying scent of her 
partner filling her nose, that heady mix of fresh tea and smoky-sweet 
jasmine that would always mean Kirika in her heart. A flash of that 
delicate face and those rust-colored eyes, vivid and filled with dark 
light, looking down at her in a way she&#39;d never seen before . . . she 
had awakened with a start that morning, breathing hard, her entire body 
flushed and aching. Then the stark, painful emptiness of the room had 
almost been enough to drive her mad.

Shaking herself in the present, Mirelle twitched the strap of her 
carry-on bag on her shoulder, regaining her wavering poise. The jump in 
time zones and altitudes must have messed with her head more than she 
realized, that was all. It was something to note for later jobs, in case 
they ever went somewhere similar again. But she was finished with it for 
now. All she needed was to hail a cab, and she&#39;d finally be back where 
she belonged.

&quot;Pleased to be home, Miss Bouquet?&quot;

She knew that voice. Male, slightly older, with a refined elegance 
regardless of which language it spoke. Her mind automatically readied 
her body for a fight, reminding herself that there were a few potential 
witnesses still close by and that her Walter was tucked in the holster 
at the small of her back. Thank goodness she&#39;d taken care of that in the 
airport bathroom, the minute she&#39;d passed through the security 
checkpoints. Glancing to one side, she raised an elegant, nonchalant 
eyebrow. &quot;Not that it&#39;s any of your business, Mr. Breffort, but yes. 
Going somewhere?&quot; Far, far away, hung the unspoken implication.

&quot;Actually, I came to meet you, my dear.&quot; The silver-haired gentleman 
stood calmly a few feet away, hands resting on the head of his ornate 
cane. Remy Breffort looked immaculate and professional, just as he had 
the last two times they&#39;d met; a dark blue business suit, white dress 
shirt, black tie and well-kept black shoes. The eyes that seemed to echo 
the faint smile on his lips were blue as well, their shrewd intellect 
overlaid with a deceptive serenity. He actually looked pleased to see 
her, as amazingly strange as that seemed. &quot;I thought perhaps you might 
like a ride back to your apartment.&quot;

&quot;Really.&quot; Mirelle managed not to snort in sarcasm, but it was a very 
near thing. A young man &#150; hardly more than twenty-five &#150; stood to one 
side of Breffort and a couple steps behind, dressed like any other 
businessman. The gun under his suit jacket was hardly noticeable, and he 
carried it with an air of someone accustomed to its weight. On the other 
hand, he didn&#39;t seem to be paying as much attention to her as to their 
surroundings, and he stood far enough back that she could have drawn, 
hit Breffort and still gotten out of the crossfire range before he could 
get his weapon free. Not a bodyguard, then, unless he was a very inept 
one. An assistant, perhaps. Did Soldats give their Council members 
personal assistants? &quot;I would have assumed you were a busy man.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; Breffort waved his hand negligently, dismissing her half-scornful 
claim with an air of amusement. &quot;I can&#39;t deny my business takes up quite 
a bit of time, but something such as this, I can make all the time in 
the world.&quot; His mouth twitched, the ghost of an almost impudent grin 
given the circumstances. &quot;Have you any other objections, lady Mirelle?&quot;

Mirelle couldn&#39;t help it &#150; she was tired, achy, irritated, and more than 
ready to be home with her Kirika. Arms folded, she turned and faced 
Breffort directly, using a glare she knew could put terror in the hearts 
of most people. &quot;How about the fact that I just don&#39;t like you?&quot;

The young man behind Breffort took a step backward, eyes wide in fear . 
. . but the Soldats&#39; High Councilman simply laughed, face lighting up as 
if she&#39;d said something amazingly funny. &quot;Oh, my dear, leave it to you 
to be so refreshingly frank.&quot; He smiled, holding up a hand. &quot;Although 
considering the circumstances of our last two meetings, I can certainly 
understand. If I were in your place, I would very likely feel the same. 
Assuming I had survived, which is rather unlikely.&quot;

The grin faded, eyes calm and direct as they focused on her face. &quot;But I 
would like to speak with you, and I would like to help you get home. 
Although I have no right, I would ask that you allow me this privilege.&quot;

For the first time, Mirelle hesitated. If it had been any other Soldat, 
she would have told him to get lost in no uncertain terms, and probably 
threatened him besides. But strangely, there was something about 
Breffort that gave her pause. Perhaps because he had told her about the 
Manor, given her the directions to save the one thing that mattered in 
her life. Or perhaps it was because of something in his eyes, the faint 
spark that seemed almost like caring. Could one of these beasts, who had 
so horribly destroyed their lives time and time again, be able to care? 
She didn&#39;t want to believe it. Still, he didn&#39;t seem to have any reason 
to lie.

Slowly, she nodded. &quot;Fine.&quot; Her voice came out laden with sarcasm as she 
flipped her hair back over one shoulder. &quot;I suppose you know the way?&quot;

Breffort nodded in return, ignoring the faint squeak that came from his 
young companion. &quot;Indeed.&quot; Turning, he led the way to a black limo 
parked a few dozen feet back at the curb, windows just slightly tinted. 
The armed &#39;businessman&#39; hurried past them to open the back door, looking 
rather rattled. Breffort smiled genially, motioning toward him. &quot;I 
almost forgot to introduce my assistant, Duncan Anderson. Say hello, 
Duncan.&quot;

The young man blinked nervously, and Mirelle tried not to laugh as his 
eyes darted from his employer to her. Poor boy, she&#39;d obviously scared 
him. Still, his tenor voice was admirably steady, if not entirely 
sincere. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, m&#39;am.&quot;

She nodded, unable to keep the faint grin from twitching at the corners 
of her mouth. Breffort glanced over his shoulder, and she realized he 
was smiling, too. Damnit, she hadn&#39;t meant for him to find her amusing. 
Brushing by the older man with a silent snarl, she stepped boldly into 
the gorgeous leather-upholstered interior, ignoring a soft snort of 
laughter from the High Councilman. Breffort climbed calmly in after her, 
settling comfortably on the deep brown bench-seat, left leg slightly 
stretched out to ease the ache in his sore knee. Mirelle knew it was the 
reason he carried a cane, knew he limped ever so faintly without 
support, though she hadn&#39;t managed to find a corresponding injury in any 
of her intel. Anderson followed, shutting the door with one hand. And 
sitting next to his master like a good dog. The blonde Corsican was 
surprised to notice the snide thought was just slightly less sarcastic 
than usual. Her mental revelation was startling; could she actually be 
feeling soft for these two? In a blink, her eyes had gone steely and 
cold, and she leaned back against the seat, crossing her legs as she 
waited. &quot;So, now that the niceties are out of the way, what do you 
really want, Mr. Breffort?&quot;

Anderson twitched a bit, no doubt insulted on the Councilman&#39;s behalf, 
but Breffort simply smiled, his own eyes faintly regretful. &quot;I suppose 
it was foolish to hope you accepted my plain answers.&quot; He sighed. Around 
them, the limo started up, merging into the steady stream of airport 
traffic as they headed for the apartment. &quot;Would it bother you if I 
admitted that I wanted to make sure the two of you were well-healed?&quot;

The two of us &#150; Mirelle&#39;s heart tightened with a momentary flash of fear 
for Kirika. If these bastards had laid a hand on her partner, they were 
going to pay dearly . . . strangely, though, there was no veiled threat 
in his tone, nothing more than a deep, carefully hidden flicker of 
concern. It was a bit disconcerting from someone she was used to 
considering solely as an enemy. &quot;Maybe.&quot; The blonde met his gaze with 
her own, answering honestly for a change. &quot;We&#39;re fine, though.&quot;

Honest didn&#39;t necessarily mean detailed.

Breffort&#39;s smile returned, quiet and gentle. &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that.&quot; He 
replied warmly. &quot;I was a bit worried, considering,&quot; a pause, &quot;the last 
time I saw you myself.&quot;

Mirelle could well imagine. The last time he&#39;d seen them with his own 
eyes, they&#39;d been limping out of the Manor, having just defeated Altena 
and survived the final &#39;trial&#39; of Noir. Kirika&#39;s gunshot wound had been 
bleeding freely, her own wounds were either red and inflamed or hastily 
bandaged, both of them spattered with blood and grime, tear tracks down 
their faces; they&#39;d been a right bloody mess, the pair of them. One 
corner of her mouth curled up in an amused smirk. &quot;Looks can be 
deceiving.&quot;

The elder High Councilman tipped his head back and laughed, the sound 
rich and somehow comforting. &quot;That they can.&quot; He agreed. Anderson was 
staring back and forth between the two of them, obviously more than a 
little confused. Both assassin and Soldat ignored him, Breffort leaning 
forward to rest his elbows on his knees. &quot;I was also &#150; pleased, to find 
out the two of you were staying together.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Mirelle raised an eyebrow, unable to think of an adequately snide 
reply for that comment. Breffort nodded. &quot;Presumptuous though it was, I 
worried about you and young Miss Yuumura.&quot; He tilted his head to one 
side. &quot;Emotions can be &#150; more chaotic and frightening than physical 
danger, sometimes. And leave worse scars.&quot;

A faint thread of unease started tickling Mirelle&#39;s spine, though it had 
nothing to do with any physical threat. &quot;She&#39;s my partner.&quot; Her voice 
came out slightly clipped, and she cursed herself for it. &quot;I would never 
just leave her to fend for herself. We&#39;re not like you people.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; Breffort didn&#39;t smile, but something in his eyes said he wanted 
to, as annoying as that was. One elegant silver eyebrow rose in return. 
&quot;Then the two of you &#150; &quot;

&quot;Are partners, family.&quot; Unbidden, her dreams from the night before 
flashed in her head, echoed with a memory of that strange moment three 
days before. The blond Corsican throttled down a sudden strange blush, 
keeping her expression composed with effort. &quot;Nothing else.&quot;

Breffort nodded, face warm and serious without a trace of smirk. Mirelle 
was glad; if he had smiled, she might have had to hurt him. Instead, his 
voice was neutral, no inflection at all. &quot;Very well. As long as the two 
of you are happy, I&#39;m very pleased.&quot;

Mirelle paused, then nodded in return. Somehow, she believed the 
comment, inane as that might have been. For a few minutes, they rode in 
silence, an odd quiet that was both comfortable and faintly tense with 
things unsaid. Outside, the busy traffic gave way to tree-lined streets 
of tall apartment houses, glowing golden-red in the setting sun. Almost 
home &#150; the thought made her heart jump, warmth touching her eyes for no 
more than a moment. Home, with her Kirika.

Breffort folded his hands across his knees, still leaning forward, a 
flash of concern once more in his expression. &quot;I believe you also have a 
right to know, my dear. There has been some talk lately in the 
underworld about the two of you.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Mirelle snorted lightly. This was more what she had 
expected &#150; though in truth, she&#39;d heard a bit of it from Paula and the 
rest of her contacts already. And she&#39;d expected Breffort to be 
threatening her, not warning her. The High Councilman smiled wryly. 
&quot;Indeed. By maintaining your independence, you&#39;ve created &#150; an 
imbalance, I suppose you could call it. Some see you as a potential 
tool, some as a liability, and some have disregarded you entirely. At 
the moment, there are several different factions jockeying for power, 
both within Soldats and outside. It could get rather dangerous to stay 
openly in Paris until things have sorted themselves out.&quot;

&quot;We live in dangerous times.&quot; Mirelle quoted, the usual smirk crossing 
her lips. &quot;So are you one of those factions looking for power, Breffort? 
Are we a potential tool for your games?&quot;

Breffort shook his head, looking slightly amused. &quot;Oh no, my dear. 
Personally, I think anyone fool enough to try and use the two of you 
deserves whatever punishment they get.&quot; His smile was calm and oddly 
genuine. &quot;And in truth, my reasons have nothing to do with power, either 
gaining or keeping it. I only wanted to warn you of your danger. Perhaps 
to suggest a holiday? I hear many people enjoy Hawaii, especially the 
Americans.&quot;

&quot;The Americans enjoy quite a bit that isn&#39;t good for them.&quot; The blonde 
Corsican remarked dryly. Breffort laughed, and she continued in a more 
serious tone, &quot;If these fools want to come after us, let them come. We 
won&#39;t hide from our past or our demons anymore.&quot;

The limo pulled up at the curb, and Breffort nodded. &quot;I thought as much. 
Still, I felt you should know.&quot; He watched with a smile as Anderson 
scrambled to open the back door for her. As she climbed gracefully from 
the back of the auto, though, the silver-haired High Councilman leaned 
forward to touch her forearm lightly. Surprised, Mirelle turned back.

&quot;You may not be hiding from your past, my dear, but you&#39;re still 
running. Be careful you don&#39;t lose something precious by doing it.&quot;

Speechless, Mirelle stared at him with wide eyes. Once again, there was 
no innuendo, no dark ulterior motive that she could see. Instead, his 
gaze was so direct and understanding she could hardly stand to meet it. 
Slowly, she drew her arm back to her side. &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Breffort.&quot;

He smiled and nodded, once again the aristocratic gentleman. &quot;Goodbye, 
Miss Bouquet. Give my regards to Miss Yuumura.&quot;

Anderson shut the door, and the limo pulled away from the curb. Mirelle 
watched until it turned the corner and vanished completely; looking up, 
she realized without surprise that he had dropped her directly in front 
of their apartment building. Pain in the ass. Shifting her bag on her 
shoulder, she slipped inside and started up the steps. Unconsciously, 
her pace quickened as she topped the second staircase, then again at the 
third. By the time she reached the door of the apartment, her keys were 
in her hand. The door unlocked in an instant, swinging open in a cloud 
of mouth-watering scents that, in truth, the blonde Corsican barely 
noticed. Where was &#150;

Inside, Kirika&#39;s sensitive hearing had picked up the swift, scatto steps 
of Mirelle&#39;s boots on the stairs, and a wide smile curved her lips while 
she hurried to make one last check of her preparations. Everything was 
in place. Looking up as the lock clicked open, the young Japanese 
couldn&#39;t help the smiling warmth that swept her face. &quot;Mireyu!&quot;

Kirika. Fierce relief flooded through Mirelle at the familiar sight of 
her partner, only a few feet away, her expression soft and full of joy. 
Two quick strides, and she was through the door, knocking it shut with 
one hand while the other tossed her carry-on bag aside. Kirika was 
not-quite-running now, hurrying to her, and Mirelle found herself 
catching the smaller, hurtling frame with open arms. Holding the 
Japanese young woman against her own body, close and hard, Mirelle 
breathed in the scent of Kirika&#39;s hair, eyes sliding shut by themselves. 
She was home &#150; this was what she&#39;d wanted, what she&#39;d been missing for 
three days.

Kirika snuggled in the warm embrace, surprised and more than a little 
pleased. She hadn&#39;t really meant to hug Mirelle; as much as she&#39;d have 
liked to, it just wasn&#39;t the way they did things, and it might have made 
the Corsican angry. But the sight of her golden-maned partner in the 
doorway, finally back, had nearly undone her completely. She&#39;d managed 
not to sprint down the hall &#150; that would have been horribly embarrassing 
&#150; but she knew she was moving much faster than normal by the time she 
reached her fellow assassin. Then Mirelle&#39;s arms had been flung around 
her, nearly crushing her against that lean elegant frame, one gentle 
hand stroking her short hair for a moment while Mirelle rested her chin 
atop the unruly mane. Kirika almost forgot to breathe, comfort and 
safety welling up through her. &quot;Mireyu.&quot;

&quot;Kirika.&quot; Mirelle sounded relieved and faintly teasing all at once. &quot;So 
you missed me, huh?&quot;

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; Kirika agreed. It was easier to admit with her head tucked 
against Mirelle&#39;s shoulder, hiding her from that probing sapphire gaze. 
The arms around her loosened, pulling back so Mirelle could look at her. 
The blonde was smiling, eyes full of warmth, and gentle fingers tucked a 
wayward lock of dark hair behind Kirika&#39;s ear. One eyebrow rose. &quot;Is 
that &#150; veal I smell?&quot;

Kirika blinked, suddenly reminded of her work. &quot;Oh!&quot; She nodded, 
blushing faintly, and couldn&#39;t help the shy smile of her own. &quot;Yes. 
Breaded veal.&quot; Padding back down the hall, she motioned toward the pool 
table. &quot;And fettuccini alfredo, and steamed cauliflower with butter. 
It&#39;s almost ready.&quot;

Mirelle&#39;s eyes widened, stunned. Now that she was paying attention to 
something besides Kirika, she realized there was a stunning array of 
scents coming from the kitchen. And even from the direction of the 
bathroom. Awed, she realized the entire apartment had been cleaned from 
top to bottom as well. &quot;You did all this in three days?&quot;

&quot;Um-hmm.&quot; Kirika ducked her head shyly. &quot;Did you want to shower first?&quot;

Thinking for a moment, Mirelle couldn&#39;t help the warm, fierce grin that 
seemed to spread from her face through her whole body. &quot;I think I will &#150; 
that plane was a nightmare.&quot; Her stomach grumbled loudly, and she 
winced, making Kirika laugh. &quot;A quick shower. Very quick.&quot;

The Japanese young woman smiled back, the expression glowing. &quot;There&#39;s 
that new violet-kiwi wash you like.&quot; She offered. &quot;And the peach 
lotion.&quot;

Mirelle laughed and shook her head, grinning as she picked up her bag to 
toss it on the bed. &quot;Maybe I should leave more often.&quot; She teased. &quot;I 
get presents!&quot;

Kirika squeaked softly from the kitchen, and Mirelle just laughed again. 
&quot;I&#39;m kidding, Kirika. Never again. And I brought you a few things, too.&quot;

Feeling her partner&#39;s warm, surprised glow in spite of the walls that 
separated them, Mirelle stepped into the bathroom and flicked on the 
fan, smiling as she caught sight of the two bottles placed carefully on 
the sink. Breffort didn&#39;t know what he was talking about, she concluded, 
turning the shower knob before stepping hastily out of her clothes. She 
and Kirika were fine just the way they were. Thinking of his warning, 
she stuffed it firmly into the back of her mind.

I&#39;ll tell her in the morning. After all, tonight is special. What&#39;s the 
worst that could happen?

Poor Mirelle, so sure of herself. And so completely wrong. (smirk)

Next one is an action chapter, and should set the stage for the major 
fun that&#39;ll be starting up. And there&#39;ll be quite a bit of fluff 
building. Pleeeeease R&amp;R?</pre>
