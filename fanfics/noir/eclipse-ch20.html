<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Save me. I feel the heat of fire on my skin, and tears sting my eyes. 
Somebody...

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice startles me, her hands on my shoulders. I 
hear footsteps pounding up the stone steps and Uncle and Georges appear 
behind Mireille, whose face is lined with worry. Uncle bends over, 
grabbing his bad knee.

&quot;What is it? What happened?&quot; Georges kneels next to me. I realize I&#39;m 
sitting on the steps, my legs twisted together.

&quot;A fire.&quot; I whimper, pulling myself into a protective ball.

&quot;Well yes, it was up here too. Perhaps the smoke is too much for the 
young lady.&quot; Georges looks over at Uncle.

&quot;No. Another fire.&quot; I choke out. &quot;The white house... with the green 
roof.&quot;

Georges shakes his head. &quot;Young lady, there&#39;s not a house on this 
property.&quot;

&quot;Just look out the window.&quot; I point upward to the landing. &quot;If you 
tiptoe you can see it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s no such-&quot; Georges starts again, but stops as 
Mireille jumps up.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Mireille brushes past him and goes further up the steps, 
stopping to look out the window. My legs are too weak to allow me to get 
up, so I wait, watching her expression. She turns back and I see the 
disappointed look on her face.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing out there but a large garden with a statue of some 
children in the middle. I&#39;m sorry, Kirika.&quot; she says gently, and I turn 
away, knowing somehow that she is wrong.

&quot;I want to go see. I have to see.&quot; I try to get up, and Georges puts his 
arm under me, lifting me. I see him look at Uncle, who nods his head.

&quot;I&#39;m going to look around a little more up here.&quot; Mireille calls out to 
us. I know what she&#39;s looking for, and I feel a chill run down my back.

&quot;We&#39;ll see you in the garden then.&quot; Uncle limps slowly down the steps 
behind us. I feel badly for him, I know he&#39;s in great pain.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I turn my head to see him, and he smiles at me.

&quot;I will humour you this once, but you really need to go to the car and 
lay down.&quot; His smile fades and I realize he&#39;s just as worried about me 
as I am about him. We make our way outside and I do feel better away 
from the smoke, as if a dream-like fog has lifted from me.

The garden seems familiar, as we walk the circular path leading inwards 
to the statue. I let go of Georges and walk slowly on my own, looking 
around. I hear the clicking of Mireille&#39;s boots and stop, waiting for 
her. She joins me and we walk together.

&quot;I didn&#39;t see it.&quot; She says to me, and I exhale slowly, not sure if I&#39;m 
relieved or disappointed.

&quot;Didn&#39;t see what?&quot; Uncle asks. He and Georges are both looking at us, 
waiting for an answer.

&quot;That white house. I looked out every window for it.&quot; Mireille answers 
smoothly. I see Uncle&#39;s face twist a little, as if he does not believe 
her, but Georges nods his head in agreement.

&quot;It&#39;s just a garden here.&quot; Georges waves at the statue. The statue has 
three children, arms raised in play, with a ball on their fingertips. 
They look happy, yet I feel very sad looking at them.

&quot;It says something on the bottom.&quot; Mireille leans over, brushing her 
hair back to look.

&quot;Can you make it out?&quot; Uncle asks, adjusting his cane and leaning 
forward on it.

&quot;For the little lost souls.&quot; Mireille stands back up and shrugs. &quot;That&#39;s 
all it says.&quot;

&quot;No date or anything?&quot; Uncle taps at it with his cane.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Mireille sighs, and we stand in silence for a moment.

For the little lost souls... I feel a horrible sadness here.

&quot;Hey Chief! We&#39;re ready to pull out and lock up!&quot; A large man in 
overalls makes his way towards us. He reeks of smoke, and I smell him 
long before he joins us.

&quot;What you doing out here in the memorial garden?&quot; he pulls the hat off 
his head, flinging sweat like a wet dog.

&quot;Memorial garden? Empie, what do you know about this place?&quot; Georges 
takes his own hat off his head, and fans himself. &quot;This little girl says 
there was once a white house out back here. Know anything about it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know nothing about a white house, but I do know they once had 
some orphans living out back here, and whatever they was living in, 
burnt to the ground with them in it.&quot; He took his hat and pointed 
towards the statue. &quot;So they razed it all and made this memorial garden. 
That&#39;s what I heard about, anyway.&quot;

&quot;When did this happen?&quot; I blurt out. I feel suddenly dizzy and I reach 
for Mireille.

&quot;Lands, now you&#39;re asking some tough ones.&quot; he puts his hat back on, as 
if it will help him think. &quot;I was a young one like yourself when I heard 
about it. Years ago, fifteen, maybe twenty even. I was living round here 
at the time, so I heard about it. Sad thing, it was. Makes you wonder 
about God, don&#39;t it? To let them all die like that, every last one of 
them.&quot;

All except one...</pre>
