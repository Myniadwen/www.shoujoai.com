<h1>Lost But Not Forgotten, Forgotten But Not Lost (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/zelasm.html">Oo ZelasMetallium oO</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Where is she? Mireille whined silently, I&#39;ve been looking for her for 
over an hour! This house is huge. God, why did she have to go wander off 
like that? And now I really need to talk to her. I am so lost; I don&#39;t 
know this house at all. She&#39;s probably lost, too. Oh, great, here again. 
Mireille leaned against the wall of the foyer, having found that she had 
once again gone in a large circle. What was that now, the fourth time 
she had found herself here since beginning her search? Well, if Kirika 
is having the same luck in navigation I am then she&#39;ll come here 
eventually. I&#39;ll just wait.

As soon as she began making herself as comfortable as possible in an old 
wooden armchair footsteps could be heard coming down a corridor nearby. 
Mireille sat up straight and called for her partner, &quot;Kirika, is that 
you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Chloe&#39;s quiet voice informed her and Mireille wondered if the 
mocking tone was actually to be found in the girl&#39;s voice or if it were 
merely her mind . . . her jealousy, &quot;I don&#39;t know where she is. Isn&#39;t 
she with you?&quot; There it was. That was definitely meant to cut Mireille.

Mireille bit back her words and clenched her fists, this stupid little 
girl&#39;s comments won&#39;t get to me now, and I have more important things to 
do right now. I have to talk to Kirika. Where is she going now? Mireille 
listened to the younger assassin&#39;s footsteps retreat down the corridor a 
ways before calling, &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Pardon me?&quot; Chloe inquired, stopping.

&quot;What is it? What do you mean to her? Why does she look at you like 
she&#39;s never looked at me? Why does she feel so much better when you&#39;re 
around? WHAT IS IT!?&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice cracked, tears streaming down her 
face, &quot;Why is it you?!&quot;

After a long pause Chloe began to leave Mireille again, calling back 
before she was too far away, &quot;Kirika and I are . . . most special.&quot;
Kirika had been silent as she and Althena had walked back to her room 
where Althena had parted to go off to another part of the manor, most 
likely to find Chloe. Now Kirika sat silently on the large bed, the 
moonlight casting a cold light across Kirika&#39;s face. I, I belong here. 
This is where I was raised, where I should be. This is my . . . home. I 
don&#39;t understand. This place, it feels different from anywhere else, 
like there is something that causes me to recognize it as my home, but 
it doesn&#39;t feel like my home. I still feel so out of place . . . There&#39;s 
still something missing.

Instinct caused Kirika to move like lightning, drawing her gun and 
pointing it directly into the face of the intruder. She had been 
sleeping and it was just now, as the light breathing raised her from her 
slumber, that she realized that Chloe had come in and fallen asleep on 
the fainting couch near the large bed. The sun was rising, but Chloe was 
sleeping soundly, wrapped in her cloak, her large boots on the floor. 
Kirika blinked, trying to adjust her eyes to the bit of light flowing in 
through the window. I didn&#39;t even hear her come in. I didn&#39;t even 
realize I had fallen asleep. Have I been crying? She rubbed around her 
eyes, which felt dry and tight, as though they had recently been wet.

She slowly stood up, stretching fully while trying not to wake the 
sleeping girl on the couch. As she turned for the door she realized she 
hadn&#39;t succeeded. &quot;You were crying in your sleep,&quot; came the soft, and 
concerned, voice from behind her, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen someone cry when they 
were asleep before. Are you alright?&quot;

Kirika didn&#39;t turn to face the girl. She was supposed to be &quot;closer than 
any two humans could be&quot; with this girl, but she couldn&#39;t even face her 
old friend. She didn&#39;t remember, and she knew that, had she been in 
Chloe&#39;s position, she would be incredibly hurt to not be remembered. She 
nodded, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Chloe said slowly. In the silence that followed Kirika 
turned a questioning glance toward the girl who had begun putting her 
shoes on, &quot;I only came in here to check on you, and I must have fallen 
asleep.&quot; Chloe rose and pushed past Kirika, stepping into a hall and 
disappearing down a corridor.

Then why weren&#39;t you wearing your shoes, Kirika thought dryly, following 
the girl a few moments later.

Mireille was sitting at the large table laden with several different 
breakfast foods. Althena was there as well and both sat in perfect 
silence, Egh, I couldn&#39;t find Kirika at all last night. I hope she gets 
here soon. Sitting with this woman is so uncomfortable. How can she just 
sit there like that? Just . . . smiling. She&#39;s senile. And where&#39;s 
Chloe? What did she mean &#39;most special?&#39; Was that supposed to be some 
sort of an insult?

The double doors to the dining area opened slightly allowing Kirika 
entrance. The young girl closed the doors behind her and nodded to 
Mireille and Althena, &quot;Good morning,&quot; before taking her seat.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; they both responded.

&quot;Chloe will not be joining us this morning,&quot; Althena explained her 
prot&eacute;g&#39;s absence, &quot;She has left to deliver an important message for me 
and will be arriving home tomorrow evening.&quot;

Good, Mireille thought, relieved, now she won&#39;t get in the way of my 
talking to Kirika. This is my chance.

The breakfast was short and as they finished and rose from the table 
Mireille began to ask Kirika to walk with her but was quickly cut off by 
Kirika, &quot;Do you need any help with these dishes,&quot; the girl asked Althena 
politely, shyly.

Althena smiled and shook her head slightly, &quot;No, thank you, I have a 
small group of servants who handle the cooking and dishes.&quot;

Mireille breathed a sigh of relief, &quot;So, Kirika, could we talk?&quot; she 
motioned toward the door, indicating she wanted privacy.

&quot;Uh . . . oh, yes,&quot; Kirika responded, walking out of the room in front 
of Mireille.

They walked along a wide corridor flooded with morning light in silence, 
merely walking side by side for nearly an hour.

Oh god, how do I say it? Mireille demanded of herself as she walked, how 
do I tell someone how much they mean to me, when they mean this much? 
I&#39;ve never done something like this before. But I have to say something 
. . . but what? I can&#39;t just walk along in silence like this, but what 
do I say to her? Do I just say it? What else would I say?

&quot;Mireille?&quot; Kirika&#39;s inquiring voice brought Mireille out of her 
questioning thoughts. The girl was looking up at the older assassin, her 
face showing no emotion, waiting, &quot;Did you want to talk about 
something?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah . . .&quot; Mireille said slowly, nervously. She stopped walking 
and Kirika followed suit, &quot;I, um, I&#39;m sorry if I was harsh. Last night I 
mean. I guess I just wasn&#39;t thinking straight,&quot; I guess a lot of things 
aren&#39;t straight about me these days, Mireille smirked, &quot;It&#39;s just, since 
we&#39;ve met that Chloe girl you&#39;ve changed a lot and it . . . it bothers 
me.&quot;

&quot;Bothers you?&quot; Kirika repeated, showing no emotion in her voice.

&quot;I, well, you see, I&#39;ve never felt like this before. This is hard for 
me,&quot; Mireille forced out of herself, &quot;I, I feel strongly for you 
Kirika,&quot; Mireille blushed. Finally it was out in the open. She stood a 
moment, lacking the courage to look at her partner, to see the girl&#39;s 
face and what was shown there. She took a deep breath and turned to see 
her partner looking away from her, Oh God, what must she think of me 
now, &quot;Kirika?&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re a very good friend, too, Mireille,&quot; Kirika smiled 
slightly, sincerely at Mireille.

Mireille blanched, what? That&#39;s not what I meant! Ugh, I should have 
known you wouldn&#39;t have understood. Ugh, you infuriate me, Kirika! What 
am I supposed to say now?! Mireille thought angrily. She sighed, Why me? 
I guess I should have seen it coming. Kirika doesn&#39;t seem very 
knowledgeable in the subject of emotion . . . or human interaction in 
general. Mireille let out a slight chuckle and smiled, &quot;Come on, I want 
to explore this house,&quot; she beckoned to her partner, deciding to explain 
a thing or two to her young friend later.

Chloe was glad this mission was only to deliver a message, glad that it 
was so short. She smiled to herself, and when I go home . . . she will 
be waiting for me. Just like I waited for her, she will be there. Her 
friend will be there, too, Chloe&#39;s expression became bland once again, 
and she&#39;s there right now, with her. They&#39;re together. The young 
assassin&#39;s fist tightened, crumpling the letter she had come to this 
dark, deserted courtyard in a Berlin slum to deliver, She does not 
deserve to call herself my partner&#39;s partner. She does not deserve to 
call herself Noir. Her work is shoddy and substandard at best. She 
cannot do her job the way Kirika can, with such grace and&#151;here we go.

A sleek black car rolled up to the curb nearby and two men stepped out. 
One lit up a cigarette and turned to the other, &quot;Nice night, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is, but this cold night air has got my joints aching,&quot; the 
other responded, signaling that he was indeed Chloe&#39;s contact.

She stepped from the shadows and both men attempted to hide their shock 
as she emerged so nearby when they had not known where she was, &quot;From 
the Soldats,&quot; Chloe said softly, handing the letter to the man.

He took the letter and opened it up, scanning it quickly. Satisfied that 
it was indeed the letter his boss had been expecting the man bowed 
slightly and retreated back into the car; handing the letter to the 
remaining man who read it carefully. After a moment he glanced at Chloe, 
&quot;Your mistress seems to think my sect has some sort of a vendetta 
against Noir,&quot; he accused, &quot;You can tell her that I have no intention of 
harming her pets,&quot; He chuckled a bit and lit the letter on fire with his 
cigarette, watching it burn in the black night, &quot;After all, if I really 
wanted to kill any of you . . .&quot; Chloe heard a small click of a gun 
being cocked from inside the car and held the knife in her left hand a 
bit tighter, &quot;I could have done so this evening, could I not have?&quot;

Chloe merely stared . . . glared. She did not have time for a fight, she 
wished to return to her home. To her. The man scoffed and climbed into 
the car which promptly drove away.</pre>
