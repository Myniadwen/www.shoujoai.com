don&#39;t know how anyone can stay still like that for long.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s why they pay them.&quot; I smile. I&#39;ve drawn her down to her 
waistline, with a sketch-out to her knees. It&#39;s good enough for now.

&quot;Can I see?&quot; she comes over, swinging her empty glass. I turn the pad in 
my lap so she can get a look. She leans over and I feel very warm as her 
bare skin is so close to mine.

&quot;Hmmm....not bad. Maybe we can finish it sometime.&quot; she plays with her 
hair, looping it over her ear.

&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; I&#39;m having a hard time breathing, with her so near. I 
want to look at her, but at the same time, am afraid. Afraid of this 
overwhelming feeling in my body, and of not being able to control it. 
What is wrong with me?

&quot;I&#39;ll do the dishes, Miss Artiste.&quot; she straightens up, and turns back 
to the table, reaching for her top.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; somehow my hand is on her wrist. She turns and looks at me, 
frowning. I swallow hard, trying to think of what to say.

&quot;You&#39;re not really going to draw me doing the dishes, are you?&quot;

&quot;Unh.&quot; I grunt, glad she&#39;s found words for me. She rolls her eyes at me 
and shakes her head. Bending over the table, she scoops up our cups, 
carrying them into the kitchen.

In the kitchen I cannot help but stare at her bare back, watching her 
muscles glide from every movement as she fills the sink and sets her 
work area in order. I set my tablet down and move over to her as she 
busily scrubs a pot.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; she gasps out my name as my arms go around her. She freezes 
for a moment, but I hold still with her, barely allowing myself to 
breathe. Slowly she resumes her work. I begin to breathe again. This new 
sensation is almost too much for me to take in. The skin on her belly, 
so soft and smooth under my hands. She&#39;s so soft, everywhere my skin 
touches hers...I lay my cheek on her back, dragging my face slowly 
across her skin. I reach the hollow of her spine and without even 
thinking, turn and press my lips into her.

There&#39;s a loud splash and suddenly I&#39;m stumbling back, water in my eyes, 
as she whirls about. Through the blur in my eyes I see something heading 
for my face but before my hands can go up, a sharp sting cracks across 
my left cheek.

&quot;Get out!&quot; she yells at me. I wipe my eyes, and see her standing in 
front of me, water dripping from her upraised arm. She&#39;s holding a 
spatula. Did she really hit me with that thing?

&quot;Get out now!&quot; she brandishes the spatula at me. I back up, grab my 
tablet and run from the room, my face stinging with pain, my eyes 
stinging with tears. What have I just done?</pre>
