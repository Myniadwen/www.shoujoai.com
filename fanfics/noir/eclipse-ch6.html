<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Rather common place, isn&#39;t it.&quot; Lambert&#39;s voice awakens me. I realize 
we&#39;re in the apartment, and he&#39;s carrying me past the pool table. &quot;You&#39;d 
think the Corsican heiress would want something better than this.&quot;

&quot;Now here&#39;s something interesting.&quot; I hear the woman&#39;s voice call out. 
&quot;There&#39;s only one bed- a very tiny bed.&quot;

&quot;Well she&#39;s going in it.&quot; Lambert turns and takes me to the bed, laying 
me down in the middle of it. The woman stands to the side, staring down 
at me.

&quot;Just all sorts of surprises in here, aren&#39;t there?&quot; she looks at me, 
and I feel myself blushing.

Suddenly I hear my cell phone ringing, from my sweatshirt thrown onto 
the dresser. To my surprise, the woman retrieves it and holds it to my 
ear.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice on the other end sounds nothing short of 
frantic. &quot;Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Mi- Mi-&quot; I choke out, and start coughing. Drool and snot run down my 
chin. The woman sighs and takes the phone away. &quot;Pathetic.&quot; she mutters 
aloud.

&quot;She&#39;s home. She&#39;s fine. You should really be ashamed of yourself. I 
thought you were bred better than this.&quot; She clicks off the phone and 
tosses it onto the bed. She takes my sweatshirt and wipes my face with 
it.

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She motions to Lambert. He straightens his jacket and they 
both look at me for a moment.

&quot;Until next time, my lady.&quot; He nods his head and leaves. She sighs and 
leans over one more time to wipe my face. I try to move my arms, but 
instead my left knee jerks upward.

&quot;I&#39;m sure your Corsican lover will be home soon to tend to you.&quot; Her 
voice sounds full of disgust. &quot;You&#39;re an outright mess.&quot;

She walks away and clicks the light on, looking back at me one more 
time.

&quot;Why?&quot; I manage to whisper.

She gives me a smile that is anything but friendly, and reaches back 
over, clicking off the light.

&quot;Dear me, my lady. Looks like you&#39;ve been left in the dark again.&quot; her 
voice smoothly floats across the room, and then she&#39;s gone.</pre>
