<h1>Pilgrimage to....IKEA! (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kbaron.html">K Baron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/2ikea-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>[Mireille and Kirika are at IKEA]

Instead of going straight to the market section, Mireille drags Kirika 
through the windy demo area because &quot;that&#39;s how my family walked through 
IKEA.&quot;

Kirika is reading one of those demo books on the shelf. It&#39;s a copy of Les 
Soldats! But there should be no more copies left in this world?!

Kirika&#39;s eyes transformed into creepy little dots and Latin chants come from 
nowhere. She&#39;s gonna attack! She jumps onto Mireille and starts giving her 
hickies. Everyone stops to stare. Actually, there&#39;s a poster hanged right 
above our heroines: &quot;IKEA: IT IS THE NAME OF AN ANCIENT WINDY PATH. TWO 
LESBIANS, TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL&#39;S KINKY FIRE WITH THEIR RED HICKIES, LURE 
THE LOST CUSTOMERS.&quot;

Luckily a child&#39;s wailing has pulled away the attention of the onlookers. 
The parents are coaxing the child to choose the lower priced stuffed toy 
like a optometrist: &quot;Now, which one do you see clearer? Right? Or Left?&quot; 
There&#39;s no difference. Both price tags are blurry. &quot;Right or left?&quot; The 
child can&#39;t decide.

Suddenly Kirika&#39;s eyes go back to dreamy Sadllo Kitty big brown circles, 
breaks away from her horny trance, and &quot;Canta per me&quot; stops instantly for 
Kirika, even though Mireille is still in the mood. Kirika jumps in front of 
the child and protects her with her black hands: &quot;Stop brainwashing her! 
Give her back her free will! She&#39;s not destined to play with cheap stuff 
animals!&quot; Mireille: &quot;This is not brainwashing. This is called parenting.&quot; 
Kirika sweetly asks: &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; To others it sounds oddly creepy but for 
Mireille, She turns away with pain. She can&#39;t answer a painful question like 
that. Her difficult expression reminds Kirika of the day she was in the 
cemetery and begged Mireille to shoot. Mireille never explained why she 
couldn&#39;t. Presumably it&#39;s out of love. But the truth is, there&#39;s only 1 
bullet left in the magazine. If she shot Kirika, she&#39;d be screwed when more 
Soldats showed up.

As they walk, Mireille notices some familiar plants her Uncle Claude used to 
grow. Oh no! Here comes another flashback.

************************************************************************

[Episode 14 Uncle Claude]

[Twisted Nerve, the revenge theme from Kill Bill played blatantly, Mireille 
and Uncle Claude had a little staring contest] Uncle Claude tried to shoot 
Mireille from behind a potted plant.

Lousy shooting ensued.

Mireille walked to her dying Uncle and said, &quot;Revenge is dish best served 
cold. Do you find me sadistic?&quot;

Uncle Claude, twitching in pain, warned Mireille that Kirika killed her 
family ---- no, wait, that&#39;s too important to be revealed before the final 
episodes!, So instead, he told her, &quot;Breffort was trying to hit on your dad! 
You blamed on Altena wrong! No, actually, she was hitting on your mom! So 
the killing&#39;s got nothing to do with the third sapling!  You&#39;re just a 
bratty dominatrix wanna-be; you even lack the philosophical awareness of 
Odette!&quot; Mireille could take no more truth from her Uncle...Bang! [music my 
baby shot me down bang bang played]

************************************************************************

BACK TO THE PRESENT --- in IKEA

A young man looking like Yo Hinomura (Crying Freeman) runs by, pursued by a 
group of half naked female assassins. Where did their clothes go?? Anyhow, 
the young man keeps gunning down these shapely assassins with tremendous 
accuracy but can&#39;t control his tears! This strange sight strikes Kirika.

She cries to the man, &quot;Oh! Do you feel you can kill and it makes you sad 
too? I&#39;ve never seen so much blood in my assassin life! The blood is always 
missing when I shoot or stab people. And when I see blood, it&#39;s only in 
blotches of purple shadow...&quot; [Le melodie plays on]

The man turns to her and asks, &quot;You cry too? Have you lost your memory too?&quot; 
(How convenient, you don&#39;t remember who you killed or slept with)

Kirika is sure this man must be her long lost brother! She cries, &quot;Yes! And 
I&#39;m your long lost sister!&quot; She quickly joins the battle by his side with 
her impossible acrobatics.

Mireille tries to cover Kirika and suggests, &quot;Quick! Let&#39;s cover ourselves 
with these stainless steel kitchenware as bullet proof jackets, just like 
that creepy relentless henchwoman of Altena!&quot;

Kirika rolls her eyes, still hits on target, and tells Mireille, &quot;She was 
wearing actual armour, don&#39;t be stupid.&quot;

The man tells Kirika, &quot;You can&#39;t be my little sister. Just look at your 
chest. I&#39;m so well built. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re related.&quot;

Mireille quickly agrees, &quot;That&#39;s right. Kirika. I&#39;m your only family. Forget 
that man!&quot;

But Kirika insists, &quot;But who&#39;s attacking you? Are they from the Soldats?&quot;

The man replies, &quot;No, but if they&#39;re mafia, sure I&#39;ll run into some of their 
naked assassins soon.&quot;

Mireille flatly interrupts, &quot;No, they&#39;re a bunch of men in black with 
sunglasses. They&#39;ve been stalking us by the order of a lesbian control freak 
called Altena to test how well Kirika and I &#39;bond&#39; as &#39;Noir&#39;. Now that you 
know so much about us, I have to kill you!&quot;

Kirika shoots Mireille&#39;s gun off her hand with amazing reflexes and says, 
&quot;He may be my brother! We may have some birth marks in common.&quot;

Mireille snaps back, &quot;You don&#39;t have birth marks. Stop kidding yourself.&quot;

The man prepares to leave, as the number of assassins can&#39;t last an episode. 
He reassures Kirika, &quot;I can&#39;t be you brother. I don&#39;t have birthmarks. I 
only have tattoos. Do you need me to show you?&quot; He starts to strip! What&#39;s 
with these people?

Mireille covers Kirika&#39;s eyes, lest she develops interest in men, and says 
to her, &quot;Dragon tattoos! This guy&#39;s creepy! Let him go!&quot;

The man leaves, Kirika is disappointed and Mireille tries to console her 
with stuff animals and plants (to replace the dead one under which Kirika&#39;s 
goodbye note was hiding).

They walk out without paying, because EVERYONE is DEAD, including the 
sixteen rows of cashiers. Mireille is relieved at the sight, &quot;Good! We only 
use cash, but that means we can&#39;t line up at the faster credit-card only 
lane! And, now no one will ask our postal code! I&#39;m not very good at 
improvising...&quot;

A young Caucasian man stops them at the exit door, and says, &quot;I&#39;ll give you 
DM10,000 if you give me a ride.&quot;

Mireille sneers at him, &quot;We have a swiss bank account. I don&#39;t need your 
money! If you&#39;re trying to pick me up, I&#39;ve come out and I&#39;m not available.&quot;

The man&#39;s eyes widen and whispers to them, &quot;Do you have a bullet in your 
butt too? You know, it reads your bank deposit box number? I don&#39;t remember 
who I am but I have a gun and a bunch of passports from the deposit box.&quot;

Kirika says, &quot;Me-eh-ru, maybe he&#39;s your brother.&quot;

Mireille argues: &quot;Impossible! Who survives your gunshot?&quot;

Kirika, still hopeful, and suggests that even &quot;The Bride&quot; can survive a shot 
in the head and wake from a coma.

So Mireille tests this man&#39;s memory, &quot;Remember, our favourite dinner time 
game was blindfolding ourselves and then use the lobster claws to see who 
clamp whose face first and I always won?&quot; Why would he remember such a 
stupid game especially when he always lost??&quot;

Kirika says, &quot;Don&#39;t you have any meaningful childhood memory?&quot;

Mireille thinks for a moment, and says, &quot;Oh! Yes! We used to play death 
pitch in IKEA ball room? Oh! And, recognize this brunette chick? She blew 
mom and dad&#39;s brains out!&quot;

The pocket watch opens itself, but the A-side &quot;lose yourself&quot; plays first, 
which totally ruins Kirika&#39;s repentant teary moments.

The man replies, &quot;No, I don&#39;t remember having disturbed siblings. If you&#39;d 
excuse me, I&#39;ll just grab a few of these IKEA home magazine to cover my 
wounds, grab one of these dead customers&#39; car keys and go get those people 
whom I already warned to leave me alone.&quot;

Mireille and Kirika head home, a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t find 
any long lost sibling, but they&#39;re glad they still got each other.
