<pre>They finally found a lead. Mireille and Kirika learned that a copy of 
the Langon Manuscript existed in Vienna, Austria. But before they were 
due to take off, they ate at a little, out of the way bistro one last 
time, somehow knowing things would never be the same afterwards.

They took their time, not quite wanting their lunch to end. Kirika, in 
particular, ate extra slowly, observing the couples around her between 
bites.

&quot;See something you like?&quot; Mireille asked lightheartedly.

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;...You know, it&#39;s almost a shame I have to kill you. To think, you 
might&#39;ve found someone nice to settle down with.&quot;

Kirika said to herself, almost inaudibly, blushing ever so slightly, 
&quot;Like you?&quot;

Almost. Mireille did a double take. &quot;What did you say?&quot;

&quot;What? Oh, nothing.&quot;

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t nothing. You jsut said you wanted to settle down with 
me.&quot;

&quot;Mireille, I--&quot;

&quot;Kirika, you know I&#39;m going to kill you when we find out everything, so 
why get your hopes up?&quot;

&quot;I just--&quot;

Mireille stood up suddenly, causing everybody to stare. &quot;And besides, 
you don&#39;t love in our line of work. Remember what happened to the 
painter?&quot;

&quot;Mireille, they&#39;re staring,&quot; Kirika said.

Mireille grabbed Kirika by the wrist and dragged her away from the 
bistro. &quot;Kirika, why? Why did you fall for me? We had a great plan going 
and you botch it all up by falling in love with me!&quot;

Kirika looked away. &quot;I... I couldn&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;How long has this been going on?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;...Since the desert. Since you rescued me. I&#39;m sorry Mireille. I never 
meant for you to find out.&quot;

Mireille turned away. &quot;I can&#39;t handle this. Our promise is over. Get out 
of here, Kirika. I never want to see you again.&quot;

&quot;But Mireille--&quot;

&quot;I said leave. Before I do something I regret,&quot; she whispered harshly.

Tears starting welling up in Kirika&#39;s eyes. &quot;Mireille, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; 
she whispered before she ran off.</pre>
