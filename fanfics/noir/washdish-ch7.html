<a href="../noir/washdish-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>I don&#39;t like rides. After the third one, my stomach feels terrible. I 
stand in misery as I watch Mireille and Anton get on the ride again. I 
can&#39;t stand to twirl like that one more time.

By the time they get off the ride, some of my nausea has passed. 
Mireille&#39;s hair is quite messy, but for once she doesn&#39;t appear to care. 
Anton has a huge grin on his face. I feel my chest tighten as I watch 
him lift her up out of the car and swing her around to the ground. Why 
did she just let him do that?

&quot;You still look miserable, little bit.&quot; Anton smiles as they get closer. 
&quot;Let&#39;s find a vendor to get you a spot of tea, eh?&quot;

&quot;Do you want to go lay down in the car?&quot; Mireille asks me. I shake my 
head. I don&#39;t want to leave her alone with him.

&quot;Righty-o then. Up you go, little bit.&quot; Anton squats and motions for me 
to get on his back. I look at Mireille and she nods, so I climb on. For 
the second time today, I am touched by someone who wants to help me. 
Anton is very warm, it&#39;s like getting a huge hug. My legs go over his 
arms and I lean my head on his shoulder. Even though he annoys me, it&#39;s 
hard to not like him.

&quot;Lead the way, lovely lady.&quot; Anton says to Mireille.

&quot;I think there&#39;s a place down here, on the left.&quot; she starts off, brow 
wrinkled in thought. We follow her, and I feel myself relax as Anton 
lumbers along. He feels very different from holding Mireille. Very 
large, and not soft. The strange urges I get with Mireille, I don&#39;t feel 
right now. It just feels comfortable.

&quot;Ah, what a lovely view.&quot; he whispers conspiratorially to me. I lift my 
head, and follow his gaze to Mireille, walking ahead of us. I plop my 
chin on his shoulder.

&quot;Are you looking at her...her ass again?&quot; I whisper back.

&quot;Of course, little one. One of these days, I&#39;ll do more than just look 
at it.&quot; He winks his eye at me. I resist the urge to strangle my hands 
around his neck. I think I&#39;m jealous, or maybe I&#39;m just crazy. I try to 
think of something else besides Mireille, but curiosity gets the best of 
me.

&quot;Um, have you kissed Mireille?&quot; I ask him. If he says yes, it will be 
easy to kill him now.

&quot;Well I&#39;ve tried, but as you&#39;ve seen, I just get a cracker for it. Kind 
of like the one you&#39;ve got on your face. Did you try it too?&quot;

&quot;Sort of.&quot;

&quot;Same result?&quot;

&quot;Spatula.&quot; I sigh. He makes a small choking sound and I know he&#39;s trying 
not to laugh.

&quot;Jumped her in the galley then? Never thought of trying that one. Maybe 
next time you should catch her in the loo.&quot;

The thought of catching her in the loo makes us both chuckle, and he 
spins in a circle.

&quot;To the loo!&quot; he shouts, grinning.

&quot;Anton! What are you doing to her! She&#39;s sick!&quot; Mireille angrily puts 
her hands on hips, looking at us.

&quot;I feel better.&quot; I do, really, although I could have done without the 
spin we just had.

&quot;Well the drinks are here.&quot; she points to the stand. &quot;I&#39;m going to 
the...&quot; she makes a face at Anton &quot;...to the loo myself, so get one for 
me. I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

We watch her go, then Anton helps me down.

&quot;Little one, I&#39;ve got a plan that might get us a kiss from her. Do you 
want in on it with me?&quot;

I nod my head. He gives me a smile, and we shake hands.</pre>
