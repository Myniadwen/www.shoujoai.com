<pre>&quot;Well I&#39;m glad to know that&#39;s what made you drop off the face of the 
earth for the last two weeks.&quot; Uncle sits down heavily, rubbing his knee 
with his free hand.

I situate myself on our bench, and take a bite out of my cone.

&quot;So that&#39;s what it&#39;s called these days? Doing the dishes?&quot; Uncle leans 
back and shakes his head.

&quot;Washing.&quot; I correct him, feeling myself blush slightly. I can feel 
myself squirming on the bench and try to compose myself.

&quot;Interesting. They certainly never called it that in my time.&quot; He scoops 
up his ice cream and holds it for a moment as if in thought.

&quot;What did they call it?&quot;

He clears his throat, then looks up at the sky. &quot;Well back then we used 
to...&quot; his head starts to go back down, and I see him narrow his eyes 
suddenly.

&quot;Kirika.&quot; His tone changes, and is now very serious. I feel myself 
tensing just at the way he says my name.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Do you still carry your gun?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I never want to touch a gun again. My days as an assassin are 
over, and I no longer worry about Soldats, now that I have Uncle.

&quot;That is unwise.&quot; He scoops into his ice cream again. &quot;As it seems we 
are being watched right now. I would suggest you return to my office 
with me.&quot;

I stare at him in disbelief, until the melting ice cream running over my 
hand gets my attention.

&quot;Finish your cone, then we&#39;ll go.&quot; he says calmly, and returns to 
scooping.

I finish my cone, glancing casually about me in the park. I see there 
are at least two men that appear to be watching us. A sudden fear grips 
my chest.

&quot;Mireille...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing you can do at the moment. Where is she?&quot;

&quot;She went to the range with Anton.&quot;

&quot;Then they are both armed, and in an area of law enforcement. I wouldn&#39;t 
be too concerned for her safety there.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; I feel as if I can breathe again, but this sudden fear will not 
leave my heart.

He motions for us to stand, and I walk over to his limo with him. I 
slide into the back seat, and look out the window once the door is 
closed. It seems the two men watching us are not following us; I breathe 
a sigh of relief, and lean back into the seat.

Uncle is talking on his cell phone, his voice low, almost as if he 
doesn&#39;t want me to overhear his conversation. He clicks the phone off as 
I slide forward in the seat, trying to listen.

&quot;Do you want to come to my office, or go home?&quot;

&quot;Home.&quot; I say immediately. I want to be there to protect Mireille.

&quot;As you wish.&quot; He nods his head to the driver, and I feel the car turn. 
He digs down inside his vest and pulls out a gun. &quot;Here. Use this until 
you have your own again.&quot;

I take the gun, feeling it in my hands, the metal warmed from his body. 
I automatically check the gun and make sure the safety is off, and that 
it&#39;s fully loaded. I lay it down in my lap and sigh. Perhaps I was 
foolish to think I could ever truly leave my past behind me... I rub 
the spot on my belly where I was shot, feeling the knot. My hands go 
back down to the lump of metal in my lap. I look down at the gun and 
wonder if it is another scar I will have to carry with me the rest of 
my life.

&quot;Uncle- do you know who was watching us today?&quot; I ask as we pull up in 
front of the apartment. He turns around in his seat as much as possible 
to face me.

&quot;Both Noir and Soldats have enemies, Kirika. The question is, which one 
of us is the target?&quot;</pre>
