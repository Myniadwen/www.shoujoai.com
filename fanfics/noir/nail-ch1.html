<h1>NAIL</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakablonde.html">Bakablonde</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Scene: Deserted warehouse. Mireille comes up behind Kirika.

Mireille: &quot;Hey you! Seen some handsome stranger wandering about? I&#39;m 
waiting for my hot date to show up.&quot;

Kirika: &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting...for you.&quot;

Mireille: &quot;What? Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;ve been duped again! Last time it was 
some old geezer and now this...some twit of a girl!&quot;

Kirika: &quot;Well I&#39;m flat-chested like a boy, does that count?&quot;

Mireille (pulls out gun): &quot;Why you sneaky little- hey! Come back here!&quot;

They chase around the warehouse, until Mireille breaks a nail.

Mireille: &quot;Now look what you made me do! First my parents, now 
this...will the tragedy of my life never end?&quot;

Kirika (starts to cry): &quot;Why....do I not care if you break a nail?&quot;

Suddenly men in suits with large nail clippers appear.

Kirika: &quot;Naildats! Run, Neo, run!&quot;

The Naildats chase after the girls. They start running until suddenly...

Kirika: &quot;Mireille! Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&quot;

Mireille: &quot;What, that we&#39;ve got guns and they don&#39;t?&quot;

They turn around and blow up the Naildats into little pieces. Mireille 
stares at the dead Naildats, then back at Kirika.

Mireille: &quot;Well, you do sort of look like a cute boy....&quot;

Kirika: &quot;And I&#39;ve got nice nails...wanna see?&quot;

Mireille (looks down and inspects Kirika&#39;s nails): &quot;You do them 
yourself?&quot;

Kirika (blushes a little): &quot;Yes, even though I have no memory of proper 
buffing technique.&quot;

Mireille: &quot;Well it&#39;s crude, but there&#39;s no doubt you have skill. Want to 
move in with me, become my partner and kill all the Naildats?&quot;

Kirka: &quot;Will you promise to trim me once all this is over?&quot;

Mireille: &quot;Oh, down to the quick, baby.&quot;

Kirika (under her breath): &quot;Can&#39;t wait to get home and buff you...&quot;

Mirielle (under her breath): &quot;I&#39;ll bet you can file all night...&quot;

And so goes the story of the two maidens with a fetish...Nail.</pre>
