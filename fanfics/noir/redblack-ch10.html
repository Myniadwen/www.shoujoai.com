&quot;Our primary objective is learning what Millet knows,&quot; Mireille briefed 
Kirika, who was seated sedately across from her in their private booth, 
her eyes lowered to the oily surface of the table in front of them, the 
cracks between each of its wooden panels caked with a build up of 
day&#39;s--or perhaps even month&#39;s--worth of grime. The small, gloomy and 
quite squalid bar Mireille had chosen to pass the daylight hours in was 
not the most sanitary or chic of drinking establishments she was 
accustomed to, but it was quiet with little to no clientele whatsoever, 
in spite of its seamy location deep in Paris&#39; red light district. But it 
was only the afternoon, and Pigalle&#39;s red lights were dimmed or switched 
off completely, the majority awaiting the sun to fall and disappear 
below the horizon before replacing its warm, wholesome glow with a 
seedier sort. And the neon shine of those particular lights would 
attract patrons to the quarter like moths to flame.

But for this hour of the day, Pigalle held little appeal except to only 
the most dedicated aficionados of the erotic arts, or perhaps more 
correctly, the most sleaziest of perverts. Mireille and Kirika were a 
good number of blocks away from the upmarket establishments offering 
tasteful and elegant exhibitions of bare flesh, and instead firmly 
entrenched in the region where the Corsican could have a sordid romp 
between the sheets with several one-time lovers all at once for merely a 
fistful of Euros. However, Millet&#39;s headquarters, a strip club quaintly 
named Slick Chicks--a fact that Mireille had confirmed from her sources 
early this morning--was to be found just a short yet shrewd distance 
along from the peaceful if grubby bar the blonde and her diminutive 
counterpart were in, nominating it as a viable staging point for their 
impending operation against the trifling crime boss and his paltry 
syndicate. Nevertheless, bringing Kirika into such an unsavoury 
environment had given Mireille pause--the girl did still retain some of 
her innocence that was yet to be corrupted or lost during the tortures 
of her harsh young life. But there had been very little choice in the 
matter; Kirika was Mireille&#39;s partner, and where the blonde went, the 
girl followed. They were a team.

&quot;Prior to that, however, we must confirm that he is actually in the 
building before we commit ourselves wholly.&quot; Mireille reached casually 
under her light lavender coat, readjusting her fully loaded Walther P99 
pistol holstered against her left ribs. &quot;But that&#39;s nothing one of his 
minions and a little... encouragement... can&#39;t provide,&quot; the woman went 
on, her hand lingering on her concealed firearm meaningfully for an 
instant while her gaze remained stationary on the table, mirroring 
Kirika&#39;s.

Mireille&#39;s lips moved indiscernibly and she spoke in a low, soft voice, 
as not to arouse undesirable attention even in the virtually deserted 
bar. One never knew who could be eavesdropping, after all, and there was 
no reason why a member of Millet&#39;s gang wouldn&#39;t frequent the place 
despite the time of day. Yet to the idle onlooker, she and Kirika were 
just two young women having a quiet--and rather one-sided--chat, the 
words exchanged between them indistinguishable from formless mumbles. 
But even if the onlooker could make out Mireille and Kirika&#39;s speech, 
unless they were familiar with Japanese the two assassins&#39; topic of 
discussion would continue to be a mystery.

Of course it may be said that Mireille and Kirika could have avoided 
such precautions if the Corsican had opted to inform her partner on the 
mission&#39;s details in the security and privacy of their apartment. 
However, the woman had wanted to scout the exterior of Slick Chicks and 
get a positive visual on possible entrances into the club first before 
formulating a plan to disclose to her. The sole information Mireille had 
bestowed upon Kirika at their home had been the specifics about their 
target, Richard Millet, including a photo of the man so the girl could 
recognise and not mistakenly kill him before they could pump him for 
facts on their chief enemies; Ryosuke Ishinomori and Vincent Hsu.

&quot;We&#39;ll stick together, with our method of entry being via the alley to 
the building&#39;s rear,&quot; Mireille said, recalling the long passageway 
leading behind Slick Chicks from a street to the club&#39;s right flank. 
Entering by the front entrance would be pure foolishness--Millet was 
apparently considerably educated on her and Kirika; the doormen would 
undoubtedly be on the look out for their faces, especially after they 
had shot five of their fellow gangsters to death the previous night.

&quot;The same means will be used for withdrawal as well. That should 
theoretically keep encounters with non-combatants at a minimum.&quot; That 
was another--while albeit lessor--reason why Mireille did not want to 
take a more direct approach to getting inside Slick Chicks; she didn&#39;t 
want her and Kirika bumping into patrons or employees of the 
establishment. The blonde so detested it when bystanders got in the way 
of an assignment; it tended to cause things to become... complicated. If 
the poor unfortunates who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong 
time caught a glimpse of her face, then... well, the less said about 
that the better. Suffice to say that one major tenet of being a contract 
killer her Uncle Claude had taught her was to leave no witnesses to a 
hit.

&quot;As I told you before Millet is strictly small-time, so expect 
resistance to be light,&quot; Mireille continued, banishing her foul-tasting 
memories back to the recesses of her mind. &quot;Still, I&#39;m not certain of 
the exact numbers inside, and don&#39;t want to rouse an overwhelming force 
directly against us if we can prevent it, so I&#39;ve decided it would be 
sensible to go in quiet--in and out without so much as a hint of a 
whisper. I doubt that they will be expecting a reprisal from us so soon, 
either, which will work to our advantage.&quot; The woman paused to take a 
moment to wet her dry throat and refresh her voice with a drink of her 
mineral water, before she set the glass down on the booth&#39;s table again. 
&quot;We&#39;ll move after sunset,&quot; she finished gravely. &quot;There&#39;s a higher 
likelihood that Millet will be present in the club during its opening 
times at night than now during the day--he acts as the manager of the 
&#39;gentleman&#39;s&#39; establishment. It means an increased likelihood of 
stumbling upon civilians, but it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;

Mireille had considered putting off any retaliatory action against 
Millet and his men until a later date rather than tonight, perhaps to 
delve more meticulously into his background and hence into his 
resources--for example the arsenal available to his men--and in turn 
formulate a more comprehensive strategy to locate and grill the crime 
boss. But if the Corsican had selected that path, it would consequently 
give Millet further time to prepare for her and her partner&#39;s eventual 
strike, and the opportunity to catch him and his group unawares would 
fade as the days ticked by. On weighting the pros and cons between the 
two options, Mireille had concluded that surprise compensated for the 
lack of fine detail.

Mireille at last looked up from the table at Kirika, the girl doing 
likewise at the blonde&#39;s movement. &quot;Okay?&quot; the woman asked in a louder, 
clearer voice, her expectant expression openly yet gently prompting for 
a response.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika uttered with a nod, her cute and innocent countenance and 
demeanour causing pangs along Mireille&#39;s normally hardened heartstrings.

The experienced Corsican assassin watched with melancholic eyes as her 
partner picked up her soda and sipped the beverage through a straw, the 
introverted girl&#39;s gaze wandering around the dusty bar with an idle 
curiosity. Mireille then sighed softly and looked away as she retrieved 
her own drink from the table, taking several swallows from it. Such a 
soft-hearted girl like Kirika wasn&#39;t meant for this unforgiving life. 
She should have the lifestyle of a normal girl her age; instead of being 
subjected to cold data for their latest assignment from Mireille, she 
should be listening to educational lectures from teachers in high 
school. Furthermore her daily concerns should be those of an average 
girl too, like exams and boys. Well maybe not boys, Mireille mentally 
amended with a wry smile. But the fact remained Kirika had been pushed 
into the life of an assassin; it had never been her decision to be a 
killer; a contrast to Mireille. The blonde wondered how things would 
have turned out if Altena hadn&#39;t aspired to revive Noir. Would she and 
Kirika have even met? ...Probably not. Mireille and Kirika would most 
likely be leading exceptionally mundane lives in separate countries.

Mireille mused whether she would be willing to trade the existence she 
had now with Kirika for that alternate one. Her family would be alive, 
and she would no doubt be still in Corsica whiling away the lazy days on 
her parents&#39; estate. Kirika would be with her own family, too, perhaps. 
And neither would be assassins; neither would have known the cruel life 
they had to live now.

Still, Mireille would have never partnered up with Kirika, they would 
have never known each other... and they would have never fallen in love. 
If that alternate existence were to become a reality, it could be said 
that it would harbour a tragedy as great as their present existence 
possessed... maybe even a greater one. Perhaps Mireille should be 
thankful to Altena for ruining both her and Kirika&#39;s lives at such a 
young age.

Mireille put down her water and flicked some of her blonde locks over 
her right shoulder in mild irritation. She had never considered herself 
a romantic, and usually would not waste time on such frivolous 
contemplations. But as she was beginning to realise these days, being in 
love had a way of changing a person. It could be a little frightening 
sometimes; certainly, Mireille had been quite shocked at her behaviour 
and thoughts on several occasions... that was, when could discern that 
she *should* be shocked--oft times her mind viewed her uncharacteristic 
actions and feelings as completely natural. However, that fear was 
starting to grow fainter, to a point where Mireille didn&#39;t mind the 
changes that much at all anymore. Indeed, after realising her neglect of 
Kirika, she even welcomed them now--they made her a better person. And 
Mireille wanted to become a better person for Kirika; she wanted to live 
up to the grand image of herself she saw reflected in the brown depths 
of the girl&#39;s lovely eyes. Mireille wanted to truly be the woman she 
knew Kirika looked up to her as... and loved her as.

Suddenly overcome by a rush of affection she desperately needed to 
convey to Kirika, Mireille focused her gaze on the petite girl. 
&quot;Kirika,&quot; she spoke tenderly, attracting her partner&#39;s roaming eyes to 
hers. After seeing that she had gotten her counterpart&#39;s attention, 
Mireille leaned slightly forwards and tentatively extended a hand across 
the table, carefully taking Kirika&#39;s glass of soda from her grasp and 
placing it to one side while the girl watched, bemused. Then, following 
another moment of mild uncertainty, Mireille&#39;s fingertips brushed 
delicately against Kirika&#39;s right palm, before the woman took hold of 
her partner&#39;s dainty hand outright in a gentle grip, covering it with 
her own and eliciting a blink and short peep of surprise from her fellow 
assassin. She lowered their clasped hands to the surface of the table, 
Kirika&#39;s beneath hers as the girl looked on in what appeared to be 
wonder, and then strengthened her grasp, giving her partner&#39;s hand a 
warm squeeze.

&quot;Kirika,&quot; Mireille repeated fondly with a supportive smile, gazing 
solemnly into Kirika&#39;s exquisite eyes, &quot;you know you can talk to me 
about anything, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika replied, nodding slightly with a rather puzzled expression 
on her face, her eyes staring a little vacantly into the blonde&#39;s blue 
ones.

Mireille sighed and her smile faltered some, unsure whether her partner 
truly understood what she meant. She was aware that if Kirika had been 
more open with her they might have averted both of the girl&#39;s breakdowns 
last night... that was, if the inconsiderate Corsican had been willing 
to act on the early warning, of course. However, a ready exchange of 
dialogue was regrettably not a feature that their relationship was high 
on. Mireille wanted to change this facet of their partnership. While she 
knew Kirika better than anyone, she wasn&#39;t a mind reader. Kirika was so 
withdrawn and had a propensity to keep all her thoughts close to her 
chest, leaving Mireille to gauge how she was feeling through other 
means, such as through the girl&#39;s body language and behaviour, which on 
occasion had turned out to be unreliable. The blonde knew that her 
partner would probably always be relatively introverted--it was 
deep-seated in her character, her nature--but she at least wanted Kirika 
to open her heart and mind to *someone*. And obviously that &#39;someone&#39; 
should be Mireille--as if it could be anybody else? Their life as 
assassins may be cruel, but Mireille wanted to help Kirika through it 
any way she could, in one part as her partner in arms who watched her 
back, and in another as her closest--or more accurately, sole--confidant 
who provided emotional support. However, the latter would be better 
served if Kirika permitted Mireille to sometimes glimpse what was behind 
those docile brown eyes of hers. As a result, the woman sought to coax 
her out of her taciturn shell... the sooner the better.

Mireille&#39;s smile reinforced itself, and she stroked her thumb softly 
across the back of Kirika&#39;s hand. &quot;I mean it. You can talk to me about 
anything at all,&quot; she tried again, &quot;your troubles, your thoughts, your 
feelings; *anything*, no matter what it is.&quot;

Kirika looked down at where her hand was being caressed by Mireille&#39;s 
and then returned her gaze to the blonde, a small smile brightening her 
features. It made her appear much like the ordinary girl she deserved to 
be, one who had just been delighted by someone she held in high regard. 
&quot;I know, Mireille,&quot; she intoned quietly, seeming to draw out her 
partner&#39;s name reverently in the Corsican&#39;s ears.

Mireille&#39;s smile became especially affectionate, bolstered by the 
heart-warming vision in front of her eyes. It had been a simple answer, 
but coming from Kirika, it was more than enough.

Before she knew what she was doing, the woman gently interlaced the 
fingers of her left hand with Kirika&#39;s right, locking them smoothly 
together until their palms touched each other&#39;s. Mireille felt Kirika 
tighten her grasp at the same instant she did, their fingers linking 
even more strongly, both young women still gazing deeply into one 
another&#39;s eyes, as if attempting to delve into the other&#39;s very soul. It 
was the first time they shared the intimacy of holding hands--truly 
holding hands--and oddly, despite the relative simplicity of the act, 
Mireille&#39;s heart swelled blissfully in her chest. Looking into Kirika&#39;s 
captivating brown eyes now, she felt closer to her than she had in a 
long while, and she was certain the darkhaired girl felt the same way 
too.

Mireille lifted their clasped hands off the booth&#39;s table and into the 
air above it, their elbows propped on its greasy surface. Looking at 
their coupled hands, the woman saw the genuine reality behind their 
relationship. She and Kirika were joined, tied together. Their lives, 
their hearts--they were one. If the alternate reality she had 
deliberated on earlier were to come about, she was positive that she and 
Kirika would meet one day, somehow and someplace, despite the odds 
against it... and they would eventually grow to feel the same way they 
did now. Mireille didn&#39;t believe in things like fate and soulmates, but 
here and now, she could seriously become a convert. In the past, they 
had been connected by the ancient and feared title of Noir, two killers 
surpassing all others, but Mireille realised what bound them now was 
something far greater than a mere legend. It was love. And it was 
wonderful.

&quot;Great. Back to this dump. Ich,&quot; Vin complained vehemently as he entered 
the room he shared with his partner, Ryosuke, in the small boarding 
house on the outskirts of Paris. He stopped near the centre of the 
cramped two-bedded room, planting his hands on his hips huffily and 
screwing his mouth up in distaste while he looked around their meagre 
lodgings, clearly despising the sights that greeted him. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
which I hate more; wandering the dirty streets of the city fruitlessly, 
or returning to this crap hole!&quot;

Ryosuke walked into the room behind Vin, his expression stony, ignoring 
his fussy companion&#39;s grumbling. He had heard it all before. 
Nevertheless, Vin&#39;s incessant moaning was starting to test even 
Ryosuke&#39;s stoic patience. The triad member was well aware of the reasons 
why they had to endure these premises yet in spite of that he insisted 
on moaning about the quality of their accommodations, nitpicking over 
every little thing again and again, repeating his tired tirade each and 
every time he came into the room. He was becoming entirely too used to a 
pampered existence these days; Vin seemed to be slowly but surely 
forgetting his modest roots... and that was something one ought to never 
forget. One must always hold family--be it one&#39;s blood or adopted 
kin--with the utmost reverence, close to one&#39;s heart where it could not 
be befouled by the corruption of the outside world. But of course, any 
disloyalty amongst family would shatter those sacred bonds and forfeit 
that reverence without the slightest leniency... and kindred who had 
betrayed their own were to be regarded with the purest abhorrence one 
could muster, something Ryosuke was very familiar with.

&quot;God, would you look at this?&quot; Vin whined as he looked down at the 
television set positioned on the table a short distance from the end of 
the two single beds, unwelcomely breaking into Ryosuke&#39;s thoughts. The 
black-haired man raised his head to share his latest annoyance with his 
partner, a frown of irritation plastered on his face. &quot;Look, I just 
noticed that the TV is bolted to the damn table!&quot; Vin revealed, 
gesturing roughly at the offending appliance with his hands. He turned 
back to the television and then shook his head in apparent gall, his 
mouth hanging half open. &quot;What, does that old bat of a landlord think 
we&#39;d swipe this piece of shit hunk of junk?! I don&#39;t even know what 
bloody era it was made in, for god&#39;s sake!&quot; Vin spat out another heated 
curse and banged the side of the TV with his hand, rattling the 
device--but not moving it even a millimetre from its location on the 
table--before thankfully whirling away from the sight. He threw his head 
back and covered his eyes with a forearm, gritting his teeth as if he 
was experiencing an immense discomfort. &quot;I wanna go home,&quot; he sniffled 
pathetically, &quot;this place smells like old people, too. I can&#39;t stand 
it!&quot;

Ryosuke, sensing that Vin was done--for now, at any rate--shut the 
room&#39;s door, wondering if the &#39;old bat&#39; had heard his partner&#39;s rant. 
The white-haired assassin then eased himself down into the only chair 
available; a rickety, unvarnished straight-backed wooden chair by the 
door that would have burrowed some severe splinters under his skin if 
not for the protection of his unique coat. Splinters or bullets, it was 
all the same.

Ryosuke turned his head a fraction to the solitary window in the room, 
noting the dying rays of sunlight filtering through the dust-lined 
blinds while Vin flopped onto his back on his bed with a wretched 
whimper, his arm remaining over his eyes. Deciding that it was safe, he 
pulled off his circular blue-tinted sunglasses, slipping them away 
inside his coat. It had been an exceptionally vibrant, sunny day today, 
the sort that Ryosuke reviled the most. If not for his sunglasses, he 
doubted whether he would have been able to go outside at all; his eyes 
did not take kindly to bright light when his mind was in the throes of 
its throbbing torment--it amplified the pain.

Not that his and Vin&#39;s most recent expedition out into the archaic parts 
of Paris had been worth the bother. Despite the two Soldats operatives&#39; 
focus now being diverted away from them, allowing them improved freedom 
to move around and search, still they had discovered nothing. No item, 
no leads--no trace. Hiring that fool&#39;s men, laying low in a simple room 
for rent in an elderly Parisian&#39;s dilapidated house on the fringes of 
the capitol--it had all been for nothing.

Ryosuke sighed softly. He wanted to go home, too.

&quot;That kid&#39;s back again,&quot; Vin suddenly said in a quiet voice, one far 
different from his previous whining tone, and one that captured 
Ryosuke&#39;s interest.

Ryosuke looked in Vin&#39;s direction and observed that he was still lying 
flat on his back on the bed with his eyes veiled, and then returned his 
gaze to the window, catching a shadow of movement partially obscuring 
the fading beams of dusk on the other side of the grimy horizontal 
blinds. With the silence of the room, the black-clad man could also make 
out the shuffling of feet just outside the window, proving beyond doubt 
that Vin was correct. For all of his juvenile antics, Vin was in fact a 
highly skilled hitman with keenly honed senses--he was at Ryosuke&#39;s side 
for a definite reason.

Ryosuke sharply stood up from his rocky chair, his abrupt movement 
prompting Vin to shift his forearm higher on his head and peer at his 
comrade through half-lidded eyes.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Ryosuke said simply, knowing that his intentions would be 
perfectly clear to Vin. He was weary of scouring Paris for Dominique&#39;s 
benefit and it was clear his partner had been too for a considerable 
length of time; they needed a short, temporary diversion. The young man 
snooping around outside their room had been dropping by the boarding 
house regularly the past couple of days, sometimes even venturing inside 
and surreptitiously asking the aged landlord probing questions, but 
judging by his ineptitude in spying, was indubitably *not* Soldats 
property. And if that wasn&#39;t enough evidence, Ryosuke had in addition 
caught a handful of fleeting looks of his and Vin&#39;s amateur stalker... 
and the accumulation of glimpses had not left the impression of a 
knowledgeable shadow. But whoever he was, he appeared to have an 
interest in Ryosuke and Vin&#39;s activities. And that was more than enough 
for the black-garbed assassin to act on. It was probably nothing, 
however--most likely a nosy teenager prying into their business out of 
boredom or to appease a personal fetish, but at the very least it would 
give Ryosuke and his partner something to take their frazzled minds off 
of their insufferable mission for one or two hours.

Vin merely blinked at his reticent brother-in-arms for a second, and 
then sat up quickly, his surprised countenance saying it all. He started 
to open his mouth to say something, but then seemed to think better of 
it and instead eagerly hopped off the bed and onto his feet.

&quot;Guess I better wear black...&quot; he said with a lopsided grin, his nimble 
fingers undoing the knot in his gaudy orange tie.

******

Mireille ducked deftly and unnoticeably into the murky alley behind 
Slick Chicks from the brightly lit street bordering it, Kirika mirroring 
her quick manoeuvre in a blur of motion. The two assassins then rested 
just inside the alleyway, its deep shadows concealing them and hence any 
of their actions from curious eyes. The sun had set several hours ago, 
and Pigalle was now fully open for business, luring all manner of sleaze 
out from the stones they dwelled under during the daylight hours... and 
also drawing Mireille and Kirika out from their dingy barroom hideaway. 
Slick Chicks had opened, and it was time for the Corsican and her 
partner to make their move.

Mireille pulled out her Walther from its holster under her coat and then 
retrieved its covert counterpart from a pouch on the opposite side of 
her gun harass, affixing the silencer to the weapon&#39;s barrel. Kirika did 
likewise, attaching a silencer to her own pistol too, before nodding to 
the blonde, signalling to the woman that she was all set.

But instead of commencing the next step of the operation, Mireille 
simply looked at Kirika for a few moments, gazing into her eyes and 
wordlessly gauging if she truly was ready--and she wasn&#39;t referring to 
the girl&#39;s hardware. However, Kirika met the blonde&#39;s stare unshakably, 
albeit with a slight tension around her eyes, making them appear a 
little harder than usual. Determined. And not all apprehensive. Kirika 
had apparently honestly settled whatever issues she&#39;d had with their 
line of work on her own. Still, Mireille wished she could have assisted 
her in finding a resolution to her problems.

Mireille at last inclined her head in answer to Kirika&#39;s gesture, and 
then made her way deeper into the alley, towards the light at the far 
end where the rear entrance to Millet&#39;s base resided, her gun remaining 
drawn. She skulked down the passageway with Kirika at her back, their 
many footfalls noiseless despite the pair&#39;s hurried pace. The alley was 
wide, wide enough for three people to traverse abreast in spite of the 
dumpsters and trashcans spilling over with rotting rubbish that piled up 
at the mould-covered bases of the receptacles, lining the edges of the 
passage. It provided the assassins with welcome freedom to pick out and 
utilise the gloom of the darkest spots in the alleyway, the pair of them 
weaving from one pitch-black shadow to another as they moved closer to 
Slick Chicks&#39; backdoor at the end of the left hand wall. Being adept at 
stealthy approaches and other such covert practices was a prime 
requisite to being a professional killer, and both young women were 
exceedingly proficient in all methods of silent death. They were but the 
fleeting shadows of ghosts.

Before long Mireille and Kirika were on the fringes of the corona of 
light that shone feebly from the lone bulb stuck above the battered 
metal door to Millet&#39;s strip club. The duo halted there, crouched low, 
assessing the route ahead... and the obstacles that lurked there. 
Mireille espied two sentries--both male--dressed with similar flair to 
the gangsters that had ambushed her and Kirika in the Metro last night, 
one standing on either side of the door. Getting past them quietly 
wouldn&#39;t be very much bother at all, but unfortunately they had to at 
least keep one alive to tell them whether or not Millet was in the seamy 
establishment tonight. And killing a single guard without his friend 
alerting the rest inside Slick Chicks with shouts for help would be... 
tricky. Mireille and Kirika would need to subdue the surviving sentry a 
mere split second after slaying his companion or their current stealth 
advantage against Millet&#39;s syndicate would be lost.

While Mireille was pondering whether or not to simply shoot both guards 
and find another to interrogate inside the building, even if that meant 
more or less committing her and Kirika to proceeding further in the 
operation, the gangster nearest the assassins exchanged brief and muted 
words too low to hear with his comrade, and then abandoned his post by 
the club&#39;s backdoor. For a moment alarm gripped the Corsican and she 
held her breath anxiously as the guard strolled towards her and her 
partner&#39;s location, but a couple of metres before he was upon them he 
instead turned to face a gap between two rusty and graffiti-vandalised 
dumpsters. The guard then reached down to his crotch and the sharp sound 
of a zipper being undone permeated the alley, before it was traded for 
the pitter-patter of liquid hitting pavement and refuse as the man 
relieved himself.

Mireille looked at Kirika beside her, knowing that precisely the same 
thought was flowing through the girl&#39;s astute mind as was flowing 
through her own--this was an chance they were not likely to get again.

Quickly but quietly, the blonde assassin gestured with a hand signal for 
her partner to move across the alley to the right, which the dutiful 
girl readily obeyed. Mireille&#39;s blue eyes flicked to Kirika for a second 
as she scurried silently and swiftly through the darkness, her purple 
pleated skirt fluttering about her trim, lithe legs. She cleverly 
situated her waif-like body behind the end of a dumpster flush with the 
passageway&#39;s wall and still outside the pool of light. It placed Kirika 
in a position of concealment from the sentries yet allowed her a broad 
view of area and consequently granted her the comforting capability to 
give her partner full defensive coverage when the woman eventually 
ventured out from the shelter of the shadows. Mireille was in safe 
hands.

Mireille returned her attention to the pair of guards, most notably on 
the sentry behind the one obliviously whistling a soft tune as he 
urinated on a now soggy stack of old newspapers. In a lucky break, that 
particular gangster seemed to be taking the opportunity to have a 
cigarette while his friend was absent, his gaze directed downwards and 
away from the Corsican&#39;s location as he searched his pants&#39; pockets for 
something, most probably a light.

Seeing that the coast was as clear as it was ever going to get, Mireille 
very, very cautiously took a step out of the murk she was hiding in and 
into the circle of light cast by the sole bulb over the backdoor, the 
hunched blonde&#39;s edgy blue eyes shifting warily back and forth between 
the two distracted guards as she moved. She chose her footsteps 
extremely carefully as she silently approached the guard closest to her, 
staying out of his peripheral vision and making sure to plant her boot 
soles on clean asphalt or at least not on any of the objects littering 
the ground that would make a sound, such as shards of broken glass. 
Meanwhile the experienced assassin kept her breathing relaxed and 
controlled, lest the whispering wheeze of air passing in and out of her 
lungs gave her away. Despite the heavy stress of the situation, Mireille 
remained perfectly calm, the palm of the hand firmly holding her gun not 
even developing the slightest hint of perspiration. This was what the 
woman did for a living--and she did it well. Mireille had numerous years 
of practice under her belt, years that had contained countless contracts 
she had fulfilled with flying colours. This was a walk in the park for 
her. She was as cool as an artic wind.

Right when Mireille was close enough behind the whistling sentry to 
reach out and tap him on the shoulder if she so desired, a man&#39;s voice 
froze her in her tracks, her eyes snapping instantly to the origin of 
the ominous sound and her trigger finger twitching.

&quot;Hey, you got a ligh--&quot;

The second guard&#39;s voice was rudely cut off as a silenced 9mm bullet 
struck him in the face just as he raised his head to look in Mireille 
and his friend&#39;s direction, the brutal shot bowling him over and sending 
his unlit cigarette flying from his mouth. Blood splattered against the 
light bulb over the back entrance to Slick Chicks, its puddle of 
illumination filling the end of the alley becoming spotted with dim 
patches in places.

The remaining gangster ceased whistling and started to turn his head 
towards where his now dead companion once stood, but the sudden 
threatening pressure of hard metal digging into the back of his skull 
halted the movement, the muscles in his entire body becoming taut.

&quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; Mireille whispered from behind the guard, pressing the 
silenced barrel of her Walther P99 harder into his head to underline her 
command.

&quot;Can I at least zip up...?&quot; the sentry-turned-hostage asked tentatively, 
his hands still down by his groin.

&quot;No,&quot; the Corsican assassin said unemotionally after a short pause, as 
if she had genuinely been considering his appeal--which of course she 
hadn&#39;t been. She had the goon at her mercy, but that didn&#39;t mean he 
still couldn&#39;t somehow gain the upper hand. Even the most 
innocuous-seeming of requests had the potential to switch the roles of 
captor and captive in a blink of an eye. Just because Mireille was the 
one with the gun didn&#39;t mean she was all-powerful... that particular 
reality had led to the downfall of many women and men in similar 
scenarios such as this over the years. No, when one became a prisoner, 
one forfeited all of their rights to do *anything*. And besides, his 
back was to Mireille and Kirika; there was no chance the blonde&#39;s na&iuml;ve 
partner would see anything she shouldn&#39;t.

The guard sighed, his shoulders relaxing a tad. &quot;Damn, you&#39;re better 
than I&#39;d thought,&quot; he commented ruefully. &quot;I guess Rousseau wasn&#39;t 
talking shit after all.&quot;

&quot;We have an appointment with Mr. Millet,&quot; Mireille said with a rather 
menacing timbre in her voice as Kirika emerged from the shadows behind 
her, the sharp girl arranging herself at an angle that covered the 
captured goon and the backdoor of the club in the problematic case 
anybody decided to pay a visit to the alleyway. &quot;Is he in?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; the gangster admitted in a guarded tone, &quot;yeah he is.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mireille said rather breezily, and then sent a round from 
her pistol into the man&#39;s brain. The sentry toppled forwards and landed 
in the space between the two dumpsters he had been relieving himself in, 
his face making a deadened splat as it hit wet garbage.

The mission was a go, much to Mireille&#39;s satisfaction. She hadn&#39;t told 
Kirika, but after grilling Millet for all he was worth she intended to 
kill him. While she usually followed the tenet that stated to always 
strictly view an assignment from a professional slant with religious 
adherence, if the blonde were honest with herself she knew she had a 
personal vendetta she sought to settle with Millet. Mireille was aware 
she should distance herself from feelings of revenge, but she was of 
Corsican blood; the craving for vengeance flowed in her very veins. And 
that said blood had been spilt under Millet&#39;s orders--the woman&#39;s trio 
of scars masked under a layer of foundation burned at the bitter memory.

But her negligible injuries made up merely the smallest part of her 
desire for retribution. Millet&#39;s ambush last night had--although perhaps 
indirectly--caused Kirika to shed precious tears. Make no mistake; 
Mireille was not seeking someone else to pass the blame to for what was 
exclusively her inexcusable failure. Millet and his now dead would-be 
hitmen *had* played a role in upsetting Kirika, even if it was a minor 
one. Still, maybe Mireille was simply looking for a way to alleviate her 
own guilt in regards to neglecting her partner, and Millet and his 
syndicate were easy targets. In any case, the Corsican assassin had to 
make the crime boss pay for the pain he had caused Kirika... for the 
pain they had caused them *both*. Yet this was only the first of 
Mireille&#39;s vendettas to resolve; Ryosuke and Vincent had a great deal to 
answer for themselves.

Mireille turned away from the corpse of the gangster she had slain and 
looked at Kirika, before motioning with her head towards the rear 
entrance of Slick Chicks, her eyes glancing over the girl for a second 
to make sure no one was coming down the opposite end of the alley as 
they had done. Kirika nodded, and then the pair of assassins prowled to 
the dented metal door, each young woman still picking their footsteps 
wisely for maximum stealth.

Kirika positioned herself to the right of the door, favouring the 
unmoving body of the other guard beside it with a dispassionate and 
momentary look as Mireille gripped the handle, preparing to enter the 
headquarters of their target. The blonde pushed the door an inch 
open--mildly surprised to find it unlocked--and then peeked cautiously 
inside. On the other side of the door was a corridor with grey concrete 
walls in a state of disrepair; cracks, and in some places, whole chunks 
of stone missing. Closed doors painted in a sickening dark brown were 
dotted along the right hand wall, while the left hand wall was broken in 
its centre by an adjoining hallway. The corridor was lit weakly by a 
series of light bulbs dangling from the ceiling--which was in the same 
if not worse condition as the walls--but the soft illumination was 
enough for Mireille to see that the passage concluded with a dead end. 
Meanwhile flickering light came from the intersecting hallway, and an 
electrical discharge could be heard periodically crackling in sync with 
it. The blonde assassin could make out no telltale shadows of people 
standing guard in the corridors, however, nor could she hear any 
suspicious noises bar the electric sparking and the muffled beat of 
sordid music, the latter no doubt from the area where the main 
attractions of the strip club were currently well underway, to the 
pleasure of its clientele.

Mireille opened the door fully and then flitted inside Slick Chicks, 
Kirika tailing and shutting the door noiselessly behind them without so 
much as a click. She treaded carefully forwards, her shoulder almost 
brushing the left hand wall as she kept her eyes on the hallway 
junction, sometimes sparing a look at the doors on the opposite wall as 
she and her partner passed by.

It was all too easy... worryingly so. Mireille had expected a little 
more security inside Slick Chicks than absolute zero. Still, Millet&#39;s 
gang was relatively petty in size and aptitude, and the Corsican and 
Kirika did have the element of surprise on their side. Plus it was also 
a business night; Millet&#39;s men were probably out where the club&#39;s 
strippers were, watching over them... or perhaps instead like most of 
the punters, enjoying their company.

Mireille stopped by the intersection and discreetly poked her head 
around the corner, checking whether anybody was in the other corridor. 
Finding no one, she prepared to go on, but caught sight of the label 
stuck on the door several metres along from the junction in the first 
hallway: &#39;Manager&#39;.

Deeming that Millet&#39;s office was the best place to start looking for 
him, Mireille darted across the hallway to it with Kirika following her, 
the darkhaired assassin planting her back against the wall next to the 
door, vigilantly keeping an eye out for threats from the neighbouring 
corridor.

Mireille cracked the office door open the tiniest margin as to reduce 
the chance of alerting anybody inside, loose flakes of cracked brown 
paint fluttering to the floor accompanying the prudent action. She then 
peered through the miniscule gap between the doorjamb and the door, 
sighting no clear presence of anybody, Millet or otherwise. Taking a 
risk, she opened the door completely, making sure she did so as slowly 
as possible to prevent forewarning creaks, and then entered the office.

Millet&#39;s office was like any other, albeit a bit cramped and untidy. The 
only thing that attracted Mireille and Kirika&#39;s attention was the 
expensive leather chair behind the large mahogany desk at the end of the 
room. The chair was swivelled around so the back was facing them, its 
occupant apparently oblivious to his dangerous visitors and the pair of 
pistols being brandished in his direction. By all accounts it appeared 
as though Mireille and Kirika had found their target, the manager of 
Slick Chicks; Richard Millet.

Mireille took a silent step forwards, reaching out with her free hand to 
rotate the chair and Millet around to meet her and Kirika, but then 
suddenly froze, her instincts screaming. Kirika turned her head slightly 
to the left as her eyes did likewise, back to the office&#39;s open doorway. 
She felt it too.

Mireille hurled herself at the desk and shoulder-rolled over it, 
scattering its contents of papers, pens and folders everywhere as 
automatic gunfire ripped into the office from behind her and her 
partner. A myriad of bullets traced the woman&#39;s path a second after her, 
pounding holes into the floor and the polished surface of the desk, wood 
chips and carpet fibres being flung haphazardly into the air. Mireille 
hit the floor in a crouch behind the sturdy desk&#39;s set of drawers, and 
then stuck her Walther above it and over her head, firing a series of 
blind shots at her and Kirika&#39;s unseen assailant.

The hail of bullets paused for an instant as the shooter took cover, and 
Mireille quickly took the temporary reprieve to anxiously check on 
Kirika&#39;s whereabouts and condition. She saw that her partner was taking 
shelter behind a silver file cabinet to her right, the petite girl 
sitting with her back against the piece of office furniture, looking 
perfectly composed with her Beretta M1934 at the ready. Kirika&#39;s head 
turned to Mireille and she met the woman&#39;s concerned gaze for a moment, 
silently relaying with her expressive brown eyes that she was all right.

A volley of renewed automatic fire showered the front and side of the 
cabinet and interrupted Mireille and Kirika&#39;s unspoken exchange, bullets 
sparking off its metal casing and the sounds of incalculable ricochets 
flooding the room with their sharp, high-pitched cacophony. But 
Mireille&#39;s heart rested easy in her chest; Kirika was fine. Now the 
Corsican had to worry about the next important matter at hand, that and 
the one presently saturating her and her partner&#39;s position with hot 
lead.

Several rounds from the gunman struck the leather chair next to 
Mireille, spinning it around wildly as stuffing burst from its ruptured 
hide and revealing what the blonde assassin already knew--it was empty. 
Millet had known she and Kirika were coming, in spite of Mireille&#39;s 
decision to attempt a prompt payback. One of his men had to have been 
watching them earlier today in the bar, or perhaps even as far back as 
when they had entered Pigalle--Millet supposedly owed a sizable lump of 
it, after all. Or maybe the false Noir had somehow aided the small-time 
gang; that seemed to be more realistic considering the insignificant 
organisation Mireille and Kirika were dealing with. Ryosuke and Vincent 
were apparently well-informed about the &#39;True Noir&#39;. At least they still 
didn&#39;t appear to know where Mireille and Kirika lived, since the pair 
had yet to be attacked in their apartment.

Thank goodness for small favours, thought Mireille sardonically as more 
bullets riddled the desk she was hiding behind, their dull and heavy 
impacts rocking the piece of furniture. A thick wedge of mahogany was 
suddenly blown off the bottom of the desk and a spray of wood dust 
stained the ruined carpet next to the blonde as she sighed, ejecting the 
clip in her pistol to inspect its level. It was blatantly clear that 
stealth and surprise were out the window and she and Kirika were to face 
a full on fight.

Mireille smiled grimly. But that was acceptable. The vendetta against 
Millet could easily be extended to include his entire syndicate as well.

******

Kirika looked at Mireille as a torrent of bullets tore into a packed 
bookshelf, raining bits of paper from the ravaged books down on the 
woman&#39;s blonde head like snowflakes. This was what Kirika had been 
waiting for, a chance to exercise her purpose in life. A chance to prove 
her loyalty and dedication to her partner and love. A chance to prove 
that her tainted existence had been bestowed a noble function at last, 
after more than a decade of committing grievous wrongs.

&lt;But to protect means to kill....&gt;

Kirika bowed her head. She knew that. But she wouldn&#39;t hesitate, not 
again. Already Mireille was sporting wounds that could have been avoided 
if Kirika had simply acted. Never. Never again. Mireille would escape 
this den of sinners without receiving so much as a scratch. Kirika would 
see to it.

Kirika slowly and resolutely cocked back the hammer of her pistol as a 
barrage of automatic fire surrounded her, the darkhaired girl holding 
her weapon securely in both hands. It felt light and warm, as if it were 
invigorated by its true and worthy purpose... much like its wielder was. 
She would defend her love utterly from all those who opposed the woman, 
and no sinner in this world would sully her celestial purity while her 
guardian lived. After all, who was better suited to protecting an angel 
of the light than a demon of the darkness; part of it, a sinner herself 
who knew that malignant bleakness very intimately.

&lt;Sometimes the most effective weapon against the darkness is the 
darkness itself....&gt;
