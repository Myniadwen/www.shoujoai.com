<a href="../noir/darkeyes-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;And he actually told her Breffort&#39;s little bitch was his cousin?&quot;

Kirika managed &#150; barely &#150; to hold back a pained groan, her assassin&#39;s 
instincts keeping her silent while her body screamed its agony. She&#39;d 
come to a few minutes before as a couple of thugs hauled her out of some 
kind of vehicle. Judging by the sound of the tires crunching, she was 
fairly sure it was a van on some kind of stone-laid driveway. Not that 
she could open her eyes to see; at the moment, even breathing was a 
painful chore, and her head felt like it was splitting down the middle. 
Apparently, whatever they&#39;d given her was designed to make sure she was 
docile and easy to handle. Which mean no more than half conscious, limbs 
twitching and weak as a newborn kitten.

&quot;Yup.&quot; This one&#39;s voice had a British accent. He was the one who&#39;d 
grabbed her from the van, his muscle-bound arms slinging her up and 
across his broad, rock-solid shoulder like a sack of potatoes. Pain like 
jagged glass exploded through Kirika, her head dangling down his back to 
throb in time with her pulse, and she couldn&#39;t help the small, agonized 
gasp that escaped her lips. Luckily, the man didn&#39;t seem to notice, 
striding along as he continued his conversation. &quot;Guess she saw him with 
her, but she didn&#39;t know who this one was.&quot; He added a shake of the 
young woman&#39;s prone form for emphasis. Kirika wondered if she was going 
to throw up. She was fairly certain that would cause problems with her 
pretending to be unconscious. &quot;Thought this was gonna be just another 
notch in his belt.&quot;

&quot;Too bad for them.&quot; His partner cackled. Working to keep her breathing 
slow and even, Kirika felt a fresh stab of anguish to her heart. So Lisa 
wasn&#39;t Alexander&#39;s cousin after all. Not that she should have been 
shocked, he had lied about everything else. No, her pain was more 
because she&#39;d been taken so easily. But of course, Alex was a master 
manipulator. He&#39;d used the blonde girl as a prop, just like his moped. 
An excuse for him to have a helmet in her size and a way to make her 
more at ease. Breffort&#39;s little bitch &#150; she wondered dimly if that meant 
Lisa was related to Remy Breffort. Her mind was going hazy again, 
thoughts going dull and unclear. She almost felt sorry for the poor 
girl. If she ever learned she could have stopped this and didn&#39;t, she 
might feel a bit guilty.

A burst of laughter drew the remains of her attention back to the 
conversation, but they weren&#39;t really speaking, just making fun at her 
and Lisa&#39;s expense. They&#39;d entered a house or building of some kind; she 
could feel the shadows falling over her, the air cooler here than in the 
direct heat of the sun. Judging by the slant of the sunlight, it seemed 
to be a few hours later, the beginnings of sundown. Evening. Darkness. 
How could she escape in darkness, torn up like this? How would Mirelle &#150;

No. She couldn&#39;t think of Mirelle, not now. Her eyes stung suspiciously, 
giving a lie to her stoic attitude. It made her heart hurt to even think 
of the blonde Corsican. She just prayed Mirelle didn&#39;t think any of this 
was her fault. Even if Mirelle hated her now, the blonde might still 
feel guilty, and Kirika couldn&#39;t stand the thought of Mirelle blaming 
herself.

While her mind had been slowly threading through her emotions, they&#39;d 
somehow ended up in a large room, steps echoing. She could hear several 
voices, more than a dozen, a chaos of sounds that made her tenuous grip 
on consciousness fray even further. Dimly, Kirika could feel her body 
being tossed down, a thick hand grabbing at her wrists and hauling her 
upright again. Her wrists were being tied, she was hanging &#150;

The sudden ups and downs were too much for her. Kirika&#39;s thoughts faded 
away once more, falling into the dark place where there was nothing and 
nothing could hurt her.



The warehouse district was deserted in the golden red light, cold and 
almost threatening. Mirelle pulled up slowly, the dark green four-door 
she&#39;d just purchased rumbling like a leashed beast. It suited her mood 
almost perfectly. Parking smoothly by the curb, she shut the engine off 
and slipped from the air-conditioned interior, thumbing the electronic 
lock before stuffing the keys in the pocket of her jacket.

Two hours had been just enough time to change clothes, pack herself some 
firepower and buy the souped-up car. Taking a taxi was out of the 
question. They&#39;d need to be mobile to get out of here, and she didn&#39;t 
want to bring any innocents into this potential firefight. Although 
she&#39;d have preferred to purchase a motorcycle, circumstances dictated 
that a real automobile was the more intelligent way to go. There was no 
way to know what Kirika&#39;s injuries might be, or even if she was 
conscious. A car would give her a place to lay her wounded partner down 
if she needed it, space for first-aid supplies, and it would probably 
protect both of them from any stray bullets better than a bike.

Of course, in keeping with the rest of Mirelle&#39;s usual gear, the auto 
was both stylish and deadly. Painted in dark green, its body had been 
upgraded &#150; siding and glass &#150; with bulletproofing, while the tires were 
reinforced to prevent them being shot out easily. The interior was brown 
leather, the gears automatic, while the engine had been tinkered with to 
near street-racer caliber. It had cost quite a bit of money, but Mirelle 
couldn&#39;t really have cared less. If she and Kirika were going to use it, 
the thing had damned well better be good enough for them.

Tossing her hair back over one shoulder, Mirelle shifted her black 
leather jacket to a more comfortable position, sapphire gaze scanning 
the deserted area coolly. She felt strange, distant, as though whatever 
was happening was far removed from herself. As though her brain had been 
wrapped in layers of cotton, keeping her insulated against everything 
around her. But there was a faint, hidden sharpness buried in those hazy 
clouds, a glint of jagged danger waiting to be called into life.

Mirelle strode across the parking lot, a small leather backpack hanging 
off one shoulder. The outfit she&#39;d chosen was her favorite; black 
leather skirt, black leather belt, dark red sleeveless shirt, and 
knee-high black leather boots. Her coat, bag and shoulder rig matched 
perfectly as well. The Walter was tucked inside its holster, while four 
or five extra clips were tucked in the backpack itself. She didn&#39;t 
expect to keep any of it long &#150; these bastards were well-trained and 
organized, if nothing else &#150; but she refused to go into the situation 
unarmed.

Kirika, Kirika, Kirika &#150; her partner&#39;s name repeated over and over again 
in her head, a mantra that pulsed in time with her sharp footsteps as 
she turned the corner to a wide, box-strewn alley between the two 
massive warehouses. The younger woman&#39;s face hovered like a vision just 
behind her eyes, shifting between the small smile Mirelle so treasured 
and the torn, destroyed look she&#39;d worn before running from the 
apartment. Mirelle&#39;s lips thinned. I&#39;ll save you, Kirika. I swear.

&quot;Wow, someone doesn&#39;t look too happy.&quot; The young man&#39;s voice she already 
loathed came from the other end of the alley. Alexander stood leaning 
against a large metal shipping container, his arms folded and an 
unbearable smirk coming over his lips. As though his presence were a cue 
&#150; and for all she knew, it was &#150; the shapes of more than a dozen thugs 
materialized in the early evening shadows, a semi-circle of menacing 
silhouettes all cocking automatic handguns in her direction. For a 
moment, Mirelle debated pulling the Walter and taking her chances to put 
a bullet through his smug face. It would be so easy &#150;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do it.&quot; Alex smiled easily. &quot;If I don&#39;t report within the 
next two hours, Kirika will be out of the country by nightfall, if not 
simply dead. And it won&#39;t do any good torturing us for the information, 
either &#150; I have no idea where she is, and neither do any of my men.&quot;

Bastard. Mirelle&#39;s teeth gritted. She knew Alexander was telling the 
truth; it made sense, just like the rest of this well-designed plan. He 
had to make sure anyone that came to meet her didn&#39;t simply get killed. 
It was a calculated risk, but an intelligent one. Seeing her realize her 
position, the young man smirked. &quot;Sorry to call you out,&quot; Alex 
continued, not sounding very sorry at all, &quot;but you know the drill. Gun 
and ammo, lose them.&quot;

Mirelle lifted her hands, palm out, then carefully slid the miniature 
backpack from her shoulder and swinging it away from her. The bag landed 
with a muffled thump several feet away, its cargo of clips clicking 
faintly. Reaching slowly into her jacket, she withdrew the Walter and 
dropped the clip from it, then tossed it away, too. That done, she 
returned her hands to their earlier position and waited, the picture of 
casual patience. This was early in the game &#150; she would have all the 
time in the world to play soccer with his head. &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll want 
to search me now, too?&quot;

&quot;You read my mind.&quot; Alexander flashed her a look of mock surprise, eyes 
widening for a moment before he smirked again. &quot;Though I&#39;ll let Aaron do 
the honors. Aaron?&quot;

One of the thugs on her left came forward, eying her cautiously. Mirelle 
stood still and calm as he patted her down. She&#39;d thought briefly about 
bringing some of her other firearms; the Firestar was small enough to go 
in her boot, and she had the holster for it, after all. Not to mention 
the throwing knives she&#39;d taken to learning with. But she&#39;d known she 
would be checked, and it might get Kirika hurt if they thought she 
wasn&#39;t abiding by their orders. No, for this, she would have to play by 
the rules.

The thorough search didn&#39;t take very long, and a few moments later, the 
brute stepped back, nodding once to Alexander. Mirelle clamped down on 
an urge to throttle the insolent bastard as he sauntered closer, 
ignoring the rest of the goons that melted farther into the background. 
It wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad move. They weren&#39;t going to interfere, at 
least not right now, but they were thugs; by their very nature, they 
weren&#39;t going to do anything without orders. They were still near enough 
to put a bullet in her brain if she decided to go after any of them, of 
course. Mirelle kept her attention on Alex, raising a mocking eyebrow. 
&quot;Are we done with this song and dance yet?&quot; She inquired, voice full of 
scorn. &quot;Or do you need me to strip too?&quot;

Alexander&#39;s smirk grew, eyes twinkling coldly. &quot;Not that I wouldn&#39;t 
enjoy it, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be necessary. You came just the way we 
expected.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m predictable.&quot; Mirelle shot back. Lowering her arms, she 
fixed her turned-out pockets, doing her best to keep her professional 
mask in place. It was all she could do to keep the scowl from her lips. 
This absolute sonofa &#150;

She paused, her mental rant halted before it really began, as Alex burst 
into laughter. &quot;Of course you&#39;re predictable. How do you think I got 
Kirika to come with me willingly?&quot;

Mirelle blinked, rage darting through her like a tongue of purest flame. 
&quot;What?&quot; The hostile word came out before she could stop it. What the 
hell did he mean?

&quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Alexander kept chuckling, his handsome face full of cruel 
amusement. &quot;She&#39;s an incredibly intelligent person, and extremely 
perceptive besides.&quot; His eyes flicked to the blonde Corsican with a 
taunting gleam. &quot;Without your help, I could never have snatched her. At 
least, not without losing a few dozen men and causing quite a stir.&quot;

&quot;I would never help you hurt Kirika!&quot; Mirelle snarled, unable to keep 
herself silent at the barbed comments. His mocking voice cut straight 
through her mental cloud, stirring it in the beginnings of a fierce 
storm. She glared, pulse pounding as Alex laughed again and shook his 
head.

&quot;Of course you did. You reacted just like I knew you would.&quot; He sounded 
so unbearably smug, Mirelle longed to pummel him to paste. A bullet 
through his head was too good &#150; he deserved to suffer for taking her 
Kirika. Once again, the primal scream tore straight through her. He hurt 
mine. Mineminemineminemine. She&#39;s mine, and he hurt her!

&quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t hurt her.&quot; Alexander&#39;s dark smirk again caught her 
off-guard. For a moment, she thought she might have actually said that 
last bit out loud before she realized the emotion was probably written 
on her face. &quot;Derrick got a little rough with her to get your number, 
and the drugs aren&#39;t any fun, but she&#39;s still alive and mostly sound.&quot;

Drugs &#150; the word set more fury to smoldering in her chest. The 
indifference was burning away rapidly, leaving her feeling strange and 
slightly dizzy. She had known they would probably drug Kirika, that 
they&#39;d have to drug the younger woman to keep hold of her, but hearing 
it still made her body pulse with rage. Her throat was tight, painful, 
voice a low growl. &quot;You drugged her?&quot;

Alex rested his weight on his back foot and folded his arms over his 
chest, still laughing quietly. Wicked pleasure glowed beneath his casual 
fa&ccedil;ade. Throwing Mirelle off-balance was probably dangerous, but it was 
ever so much fun. &quot;It was rather required.&quot; He commented, lips 
twitching. &quot;How else was I ever going to get her to agree to my little 
kissing scheme? Not that she minded the attention.&quot;

Pay dirt, he thought in amusement, watching the Corsican&#39;s lips tighten 
and her eyes flash. She was so very easy to manipulate. Just as easy as 
Kirika, in her own way. &quot;She would have known if you used the usual 
types of drugs.&quot; The words came tight and strained, part question and 
part statement. Alexander nodded cheerfully. &quot;It&#39;s a special new mix my 
Master&#39;s been refining. Similar to alcohol intoxication &#150; mostly an 
inhibitation blocker, with a few special modifications. Seems to cause 
an excess of emotional outbursts. The second one came later. It&#39;ll keep 
her under for a few hours while we have our little chat.&quot;

Oh, Kirika. Mirelle&#39;s heart contracted, despair making her fury 
helpless. He gave you things, he put things in your body, and I didn&#39;t 
even notice. How stupid am I? She wanted to scream in rage, to tear him 
apart at the seams &#150;

No! Practical training intruded, though she knew the young man saw her 
hands twitch. Find out what he wants. You can kill him once you know 
what this was planned for.

&quot;So what do you want?&quot; An undercurrent of snarling anger growled beneath 
the question, and Alex smiled smugly. &quot;Patience is a virtue, miss 
Mirelle. So is common courtesy, I believe.&quot;

Mirelle just glared at him.

&quot;Fine, fine, if you insist on getting down to business.&quot; With a 
mock-sigh, Alexander shook his head again before fixing her with a 
serious gaze. &quot;My Master knows of your skills as Noir, and he&#39;s decided 
that he requires your services. As long as you complete the jobs I give 
you, Kirika will stay unharmed. If you make a mistake or get caught &#150; &quot; 
He shrugged. &quot;We&#39;ll wash our hands of the whole thing.&quot;

And Kirika dies. The words were unspoken, but Mirelle could hear them 
just fine. Her heart thudded painfully. Forget dizzy &#150; she was starting 
to feel like the entire world was spinning just out of sight. Something 
was shifting in her head, everything shading distant and shadowed. 
Somehow, her words came out sounding completely natural, only laced with 
the fury prickling through her veins. &quot;Noir is a name for two. Kirika 
and I work together.&quot;

Alex nodded once, slowly, as though he had expected the comment. &quot;Yes, 
but both of you have worked alone when the situation requires it. It&#39;s 
possible.&quot; He seemed offhand, abominably casual. &quot;You&#39;re actually quite 
interchangeable, when you get right down to it. Both of you are 
incredibly trained, more than capable, the very best in your field. 
Kirika just doesn&#39;t quite have the &#150; social skills, I suppose you&#39;d call 
it. She doesn&#39;t do as well with situations that require working with 
people.&quot;

&quot;So that &#150; &quot; Mirelle breathed, eyes widening in shock. The revelation 
was surprising enough to pause whatever was going on in her mind. That 
was why he&#39;d taken Kirika instead of her? Because she could do better 
with people?

Seeing the expression on her face, Alexander&#39;s Cheshire Cat grin 
widened, gaze twinkling once more. &quot;Of course. Master needs someone who 
can get close to their targets in a public setting without raising 
suspicion. Though I must admit, your current situation with Kirika made 
everything much easier. Still, we want to make sure this is done right, 
especially the first targets. They&#39;re a bit &#150; delicate, and you have 
unique in with them.&quot;

&quot;Delicate?&quot; Mirelle repeated, faintly questioning. The world was still 
spinning, and now her legs and fingertips were tingling. Vaguely, she 
wondered if she was having a stroke. What the hell was wrong with her?

Alex&#39;s features flickered with an ugly flare of satisfaction. &quot;You know 
them better than most people. Remy Breffort and his niece, Lisa 
Breffort.&quot;

Breffort? She couldn&#39;t help but be stunned. That someone wanted her 
personal pain in the ass dead wasn&#39;t surprising, considering the world 
they both dealt in. Still, to get someone like Noir to kill both Remy 
and Lisa, this had to be big. The earlier conversation with the 
silver-haired Soldat flashed through her slowly-splintering thoughts. 
&quot;So your Master is another bastard Councilman?&quot;

&quot;My Master is a great man!&quot; Alexander&#39;s voice was sharper than usual, 
his eyes flashing with anger. Pale satisfaction touched Mirelle; 
apparently, she&#39;d scratched a nerve. The emotion must have been visible 
on her face, because the glare Alex turned on her could have peeled 
paint. &quot;If it helps to ease your conscience any, Lisa deserves your 
rage. She saw me the day I went after Kirika for the first time. Thought 
your partner was another of my conquests.&quot; He snorted a vicious laugh. 
&quot;Not that I would mind having a try at her. With you turning her down 
like you did, she&#39;d probably be grateful for some attention.&quot;

Mirelle&#39;s heart stopped for a moment, every part of her frozen. He 
couldn&#39;t &#150; he wouldn&#39;t &#150; Kirika couldn&#39;t &#150; what the hell was he talking 
about, turned her down?

From the expression on his features, Alexander knew he&#39;d gotten to her. 
Still slightly stiff, he forced himself to relax backward, almost a 
slouch. His voice was casually cruel. &quot;Oh, come on. You did exactly what 
I knew you would. Poor Kirika loves you so much, but you&#39;re too much of 
a coward to admit you love her.&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Mirelle whispered. Her throat was tight, muscles trembling 
beneath her skin and thoughts reeling. Everything in her body seemed to 
be rebelling, mind poised on the edge of some dark, unknown chasm. It 
was the oddest feeling &#150; as though she&#39;d been to the entrance of this 
shadowed place before, but never entered until now. She would have sworn 
she could taste metal on her tongue, smell the lingering echoes of 
cordite and gunpowder in the air. Something was rising inside her, 
taking over &#150;

Alex didn&#39;t notice, his smirk turning into a low, full-blown laugh. 
&quot;Does it hurt to hear the truth? You were too afraid to tell her you 
loved her, so you hit her. Slapped the one person that cares about you 
more than anything else in the world, and did it hard enough to make her 
cry.&quot; He shook his head, laughing again deliberately. &quot;I should have 
taken advantage of her earlier. Bet I could have gotten at least one 
good rebound fuck before the Master needed her.&quot;

His words were a razor-sharp spike driven through her very core. Her 
thoughts shattered into sparkling, crystalline fragments; her body 
jerked once, then went absolutely still, hardly even breathing. The 
world had shifted, twisted into distant shades beyond anything a normal 
person could ever comprehend. But that was okay. Her head bowed, eyes 
shadowed, welcoming the darkness into her.

That was okay, because she wasn&#39;t normal.

She was Noir.



&quot;You didn&#39;t touch her.&quot;

It was her voice that first alerted Alexander that something was very, 
very wrong. Leaning back, his arms folded across his chest, the young 
man paused to stare searchingly at the tall blonde Corsican before him. 
She stood motionless a few dozen feet away, head down, arms loose at her 
sides, only the soft rise and fall of her chest indicating that she was 
alive. If he hadn&#39;t known for a fact that she was the only female within 
four blocks, he would have doubted the words were even hers.

It wasn&#39;t the fact that she made it a statement rather than a question 
that sent his internal alarms on high alert. He&#39;d expected that, 
actually; Mirelle may have been many things &#150; brash, intense, confident 
bordering on arrogant &#150; but she knew her partner, and she knew Kirika 
would never have sex with him willingly. And it wasn&#39;t the tight, 
leashed rage he knew was smoldering somewhere beneath the words. He&#39;d 
expected to hear something like it, had been hearing and seeing 
something like it since Mirelle had appeared at the mouth of the 
alleyway. That had been the point of putting her off balance, after all. 
Aside from being a dangerous thrill for him, rattling the blonde made it 
harder for her to focus on a decent defense or counterattack of her own.

No, it was the flat, measured calm of her statement that sent a flare of 
fear through him. There was no real emotion at all in the words, nothing 
more than the bare facts. Her stance had somehow become easy and 
assured, shoulders back and breath soft, different than the young woman 
who&#39;d stood there only seconds before. It was as though all the vibrant 
light that made Mirelle so alive had simply disappeared.

No, not disappeared. Shoved aside. Alex frowned, pulse picking up just 
slightly. The bright light was gone, but there was something else in its 
place, a dark coil of smooth, ready tension that was almost superhuman 
in its intensity. She looked regal, feral, a shadow given substance for 
the moment. There was something oddly familiar about it all, like a 
picture he couldn&#39;t quite place.

&quot;Awwww, you don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;m hurt.&quot; He spoke sarcastically to cover 
the sudden flash of nervousness, his voice biting. She wanted to 
unbalance him? Fine, then. He&#39;d stop pulling his punches. &quot;She&#39;s so 
sweet and soft &#150; and with those muscles, I bet she&#39;s a wonderful lay. 
Though you wouldn&#39;t know about that, would you?&quot;

There was no response, not even the twitch of her pale, elegant hands he 
was so looking forward to. Mirelle seemed to simply be waiting for 
whatever random nonsense he felt like spouting to end, calm as if she 
had all the time in the world. Anger made Alexander&#39;s jaw tight. What 
the hell had happened? Where was the fire, the fierce flare he&#39;d seen 
when he studied her for these last few weeks? Mirelle Bouquet wore her 
sharper emotions on her sleeve &#150; except this time, she wasn&#39;t. He didn&#39;t 
understand &#150;

And then she lifted her head, and he saw her eyes for the first time, 
and he understood just where he&#39;d seen that attitude before.

Oh, my God. They were the eyes, the eyes he&#39;d seen in pictures of 
Altena&#39;s bitch Chloe and a few brief shots of Kirika at her most deadly. 
For a moment, Alex&#39;s mind flashed back to the moment he and his Master 
had first put together the plan, to the rush of gratitude he felt that 
he would be kidnapping Kirika. If he was forced to deal with one of them 
as an assassin and unwilling ally, he would rather it be the blonde 
Corsican. Of the two, she was safer &#150; the superhuman abilities that were 
showcased in those terrifyingly intense eyes had always been absent in 
Mirelle. She wasn&#39;t as strong, didn&#39;t have the darkness and death in her 
blood.

Except apparently she did, and now that very same type of eyes were 
staring back at him, merciless blue orbs flat and cold as a sheet of 
glacial ice. With her head held high, golden tresses highlighted a 
bloody crimson in the setting sun, she looked positively inhuman. An 
immortal death goddess come to take vengeance on those who had done her 
wrong. Even the air around her was wound tight, crackling with purpose 
and intent. She was unarmed &#150; at least for the moment &#150; but she needed 
no weapon. Her very body was enough.

A rush of horror and terror made Alexander take a step backward, shocked 
into an instinctive prey-like jerk at the predatory knowledge in those 
eyes. His arms unfolded on their own, half rising with the palms held 
out as though to ward off the inevitable blow; his mouth opened, ready 
to order his men to open fire, shoot her, shoot her now &#150;

The gasped words never got past his half-parted lips. Mirelle was 
suddenly in motion, her movements so swift and fluid Alex could hardly 
track them. Her left hand had hold of the barrel of the gun on that 
side, jerking it farther away from her while her boot heel shattered the 
knee of its owner. Eric, Alexander remembered distractedly. A 
split-second later, her right hand had jammed the cartilage of Eric&#39;s 
nose into his brain, and the body dropped lifelessly to the pavement as 
she darted forward. It had all taken less time than an eyeblink. Alex 
saw her scoop up the unloaded Walter from the ground and turn in a 
smooth spin, fist whipping out to crush the throat of the still shocked 
thug across the circle &#150; Franz, he realized in some far corner of his 
brain. She had just killed Franz, and used his gun to shoot Jean-Michael 
when the other man recovered enough to lunge the few feet towards her. 
Her leg moved forward, toe stomping on just the right spot, and the 
fallen clip flipped upward end over end to land with a smack in her 
waiting palm. Another flash of movement, and Dante&#39;s body joined his 
comrades on the ground while Mirelle reloaded and racked her weapon back 
with practiced ease.

Alexander took another step away, then a third and a fourth, hearing the 
zinging whine of automatic bullets all around him as the men he&#39;d 
stationed on the warehouse rooftops joined in the fray. Mirelle dodged 
the half-stunned shots easily, several more men on the ground falling 
prey to their own comrades as she got them to hit each other. A rapid 
flurry of gunfire from her swift-moving form took only a few more 
minutes to silence the sentry snipers. Alex yanked his own Glock .9 from 
his waistband, startled to see his hands were shaking. She had made 
short work of twenty-four of the twenty-six men he&#39;d brought with him. 
It was insanity. How could anyone do such a thing?

The sudden bang of another blast came as he flicked the safety off his 
piece. His hand rose, and another shot sounded. Alexander blinked, numb 
and shocked, his gun spinning away across the alley while blood 
blossomed from his fingers. Pain shot to his brain and jangled there. 
She had shot through his hand. From more than a dozen feet away, turning 
away from the man she&#39;d just killed, all in the space of ten seconds. It 
was impossible!

Alex gasped for air and jerked to the other side, eyes finding one of 
the many automatics scattered across the pavement. His body dove for it, 
unwounded arm outstretched. He was fast.

This time, he heard the bark of the Walter at the same moment his knee 
exploded in agony, dumping him unceremoniously to the dirty cement since 
his leg could no longer support him. The same distant part of him that 
had named his men as they died noted the absolute perfection of her aim; 
the bullet had gone straight through his kneecap. Desperately, he kept 
reaching for the weapon. If only he could touch it, grab it &#150;

His wrist shattered with a third expertly-placed shot, and Alex&#39;s 
heaving, ragged breaths became a shuddering, tortured moan, body curling 
in to cradle his now useless arm. Blood oozed &#150; no, poured from his 
wounds, spreading on the ground around him. His mind was a haze of 
agonized, creeping horror.

A lean shadow fell over him, and Alexander looked up to see Mirelle 
backlit by the crimson sun, her eyes still that terrifying darkness. He 
tried to leer at her, to smirk, something that would get a reaction.

She was completely expressionless as her foot impacted with his face, 
splitting both lips, cracking teeth and pulping his nose. Alex&#39;s head 
rocked back, gagging and choking on his own blood. Another kick, and a 
new wound opened on his forehead, spilling more scarlet liquid into his 
rapidly-swelling eye. A third strike cracked something in his ribs, 
leaving him even more breathless. After a few moments of hacking and 
gasping, his blurred gaze rolled upward, focusing with difficulty on her 
impassive features. &quot;You&#39;re &#150; a bitch.&quot; He wheezed, coughing up more 
blood.

Without so much as a twitch or flick of her eyes, Mirelle brought her 
heel down again, this time grinding his wounded hand flat against the 
ground. Alexander tried to scream, the noise little more than a loud 
gurgle of blood. Instinctively, he tugged his arm, trying to free his 
injured palm from the pain and howling-gargling in renewed agony as the 
movement tore his bullet wound further. &quot;You won&#39;t get to her from me.&quot; 
His voice was a hoarse rasp. &quot;I don&#39;t know where she is. You&#39;ll never 
find her.&quot;

Mirelle bent slightly, enough that she could look him full in the face, 
and Alex saw the fierce anger and determination raging beneath the flat 
coldness. &quot;I will tear this city apart brick by brick, burn it to the 
ground if I have to.&quot;

Her voice, her narrowed eyes were death itself. &quot;We are Noir. She is 
mine, and I will find her.&quot;

Her gun shifted to point at his head. Staring up at into that terrifying 
gaze, Alex had one second of complete epiphany. No one had ever seen 
Mirelle as the True Noir, and so considered the blonde Corsican as the 
weaker of the partners. But no one had ever threatened anything she 
would not give up. Even trying to take her life was expected in her 
work. A strange, twitching smile, inane as it was, touched his split 
lips. He had finally found the line in Mirelle which could not be 
crossed.

One did not mess with her woman.

The Walter barked once more, and Alexander rolled onto his back, a neat 
hole through the center of his forehead. Mirelle stood silent and 
motionless for a moment, staring down at his battered body, those wide 
open eyes. Then, without even a shrug, she turned away.

She wouldn&#39;t bother to close his eyes. She didn&#39;t care that much.



Meanwhile:

Please, God, let us find them.

Lisa Breffort fidgeted for the possibly the millionth time, jeans 
sliding with a whispered hush across the leather of her uncle&#39;s limo as 
she scanned the streets. She was not prone to praying &#150; her Soldats 
training and the odd church service aside &#150; but as the massive car 
hummed along, the blonde young woman found the plea whispering through 
her thoughts like a mantra. They had to find Mirelle and Kirika, they 
just had to.

Kirika &#150; a flare of shame smeared through her, guilt battling with her 
worry. It was her fault Alexander had managed to get close to the 
younger Noir, her fault that Kirika hadn&#39;t been put on her guard in the 
very beginning. If either of the women died, the blame would be hers. 
She should have realized what he was planning.

If only she had realized it sooner &#150;



She and Alexander were walking away from the art store, his arm casually 
around her waist. Lisa waited until they were far enough down away from 
the shop to be out of sight before pushing him off. &quot;She&#39;s not looking 
at us anymore, you can get off.&quot; Turning, she glared at him, arms folded 
in annoyance. &quot;So what, is she another notch in your belt?&quot;

Alex smirked, amused. &quot;Something like that.&quot; Leaning back, he appeared 
completely at ease, which irritated Lisa to no end. She&#39;d hated that 
about him ever since they were children, his ability to act like nothing 
in the world could bother him. Of course, he&#39;d pissed her off and driven 
her crazy since they were eight &#150; it wasn&#39;t as though the years had 
changed him any. His voice was calm, thoughtful. &quot;So that&#39;s what&#39;s 
bothering you. Poor baby. I thought you were living in England.&quot;

&quot;America. I came home two weeks ago.&quot; She scowled as he grinned. &quot;You 
don&#39;t have to act so pleased. I came to help Uncle, not to see you. 
You&#39;re an unpleasant bonus.&quot;

&quot;And you dragged me away from a nice, stimulating conversation because - 
&quot; His voice trailed off, one eyebrow raised, and Lisa longed to kick 
him. &quot;Because she&#39;s too good for you.&quot; She retorted, still frowning. 
From what she&#39;d managed to see of the young woman, the girl was shy, 
beautiful and sweet &#150; everything Alexander loved to sully, and 
everything Lisa would do her best to keep out of his hands.

Alex burst into laughter, and Lisa socked him in the arm. Still 
chortling, he held up his hands, palm out. &quot;Awwww, how sweet! You want 
to keep the innocent away from the big bad Alex, huh?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re an ass.&quot; Lisa glared, knowing it wouldn&#39;t do a damned bit of 
good. If Alexander had set his sights on the young woman, she wasn&#39;t 
going to be able to stop him. Not short of hiring a hit, anyway, and in 
spite of her hatred, she wouldn&#39;t be starting an inter-organizational 
war because the brunette young man was a jerk. Her upper lip curled 
viciously, and she spun around, stalking off and ignoring his smirking 
chuckles. That self-smug, piece of shit, pain in the ass bastard &#150;



She&#39;d seen them a few days later, sitting on the bank near a small 
boutique mall, sketchbooks spread out on the grass and chattering 
eagerly. It was just like him, she thought angrily. Artist, his ass &#150; 
he&#39;d gone through two years of art school long ago, but his pictures 
were all technical, no heart and no soul. Hell, he had only gone to the 
school in the first place because his &#39;Master&#39; wanted to keep tabs on 
her as Remy Breffort&#39;s niece. It pissed her off to no end that he could 
sit there and pretend to know anything about art. Still, she couldn&#39;t 
help but feel sorry for the young woman seated so unknowing beside him. 
He would break her heart for sure.

&quot;Uncle, you should at least have some tea.&quot;

She pushed open the door to her Uncle&#39;s &quot;war room,&quot; the massive 
wood-paneled study that had been designed for intelligence gathering and 
situations just like this. A large, dark wood table took up most of the 
center of the room, comfortable leather chairs arranged around it while 
smaller countertops and banks of computer equipment lined the walls. On 
the far wall, a giant television-style screen was connected to the 
projector hanging bolted from the ceiling. Her Uncle had been working in 
here for most of the day, taking only enough time to meet with Mirelle. 
The last of his men had left a few hours before, but as usual, Lisa knew 
he hadn&#39;t had anything to eat or drink since then. Typical Uncle. 
Slipping the tray of tea things onto the table beside her uncle, she 
shook her head wryly, glanced up at the images with interest.

And promptly felt the floor drop out from under her, the world freezing 
to a shocked, razor-sharp point.

&quot;Lisa?&quot; Uncle turned, his brow creased with concern, standing as she 
tripped slightly over a chair and grabbed shakily for the arm rest. Lisa 
couldn&#39;t answer, staring riveted at the two headshots situated on the 
screen. One she recognized as Mirelle Bouquet, smiling in the warm 
sunlight, her golden hair spilling down her back and sapphire gaze 
turned to something outside the picture&#39;s borders. And the second? The 
same sweet, dark-haired Asian young woman she&#39;d seen with Alexander, 
turning to look over her shoulder with a soft smile. There was no 
mistaking those incredible eyes. Lisa sank into the chair she&#39;d grasped, 
pulse pounding, gaze never leaving the picture. &quot;Uncle, who &#150; who is 
that?&quot;

&quot;Who &#150; oh.&quot; Still puzzled, her uncle took her hand, stroking it gently. 
&quot;I had forgotten, you&#39;ve never seen her. That&#39;s Kirika Yuumura, 
Mirelle&#39;s partner.&quot;

&quot;The other half of Noir.&quot; Lisa spoke numbly, overwhelmed. Of course &#150; 
Kirika was a Japanese name, but it hadn&#39;t registered that this girl 
might be Japanese. There were so many other possibilities . . .

. . . no, she thought, remembering Alex&#39;s smirk. There was no other 
possibility. She should have known.

&quot;Alexander.&quot; She said softly, seeing her uncle start in shock. He knew 
Alexander &#150; after all, the young man had grown up with her and several 
other of the high-ranking Soldats&#39; children. &quot;Alexander is here in 
Paris, and I&#39;ve seen him with her. If he has Kirika, Mirelle &#150; she would 
do anything he asked.&quot;

Remy Breffort swore under his breath, snatching up his cell phone from 
the table and hurriedly punching in numbers. The phone on the other end 
rang for a few minutes without anyone picking up, and the Soldats High 
Councilman cursed again. &quot;There&#39;s no answer.&quot; A low hum of a call 
interrupting cut through the taut air. Breffort thumbed another button, 
bringing the cell back to his ear. &quot;Yes?&quot;

Listening for a few seconds, he gave a soft, violent exclamation. &quot;Keep 
looking. We need the limo brought around front. That little bastard was 
working on them right under our noses.&quot;

He dropped the phone into his pocket and hurried for the door. &quot;Come, 
Lisa, quickly.&quot;

&quot;Uncle?&quot; She leapt up automatically, falling into step just behind him. 
Outside the door, she could hear the limo&#39;s engine already revving up.

&quot;Mirelle&#39;s left the flat and gone to purchase a car.&quot; Breffort motioned, 
and Anderson leapt to open the manor&#39;s front door before taking up a 
position at Lisa&#39;s side. &quot;Some of the extra troops have been on the move 
as well. It&#39;s likely Alexander&#39;s arranged a meet.&quot;

&quot;We have to find them, now.&quot;

More than an hour later, the limo was still cruising through the 
warehouse district, one of Alex&#39;s favorite old haunts. Lisa wondered if 
they&#39;d run out of prayers. No one had seen Mirelle or her new car, and 
there hadn&#39;t been any reports of firefights breaking out or dead bodies 
popping up. With a sharp sigh, she glared out the window once more. This 
was ridiculous &#150;

&quot;Driver, stop!&quot; Her uncle&#39;s voice suddenly broke through her dark 
reverie, and the limo nearly stood on its grill as the driver slammed on 
the brakes. Lisa&#39;s head whipped around, momentarily too surprised to 
brace for impact; by the time she had stopped bouncing across the back 
seat, Remy Breffort was already out of the car, door left open as he 
limped-ran toward whatever it was he had seen. Lisa took off after her 
uncle, sneakers thudding as she tried to keep up. Closer, she could make 
out what he had seen. The distinctive muzzle flash of a single 
semi-automatic pistol. A Walter PPK, to be exact.

Mirelle&#39;s trademark weapon.

A few minutes more, and she skidded to a stop several steps behind her 
uncle, awed at the carnage littering the alleyway. Counting the bodies 
slung over the warehouse rooftops, there were at least twenty-six dead, 
maybe more. It looked as though they had all died within moments of each 
other, some before they could even get off a single shot.

And standing in the center of the ravaged masses? A tall, lean form in 
black leather and crimson velvet, pale skin and golden tresses 
highlighted bloodily against the bloody sun. The Walter held in one 
hand, a clip in the other as the owner reloaded her weapon with brisk 
efficiency. For a moment, both Soldats froze, unable to move. Lisa was 
shocked. This was Mirelle? The young woman she&#39;d argued with and teased 
only hours ago?

&quot;Mirelle?&quot; Her uncle&#39;s voice was low, hesitant, almost unsure for the 
first time in Lisa&#39;s memory. The goddess-like figure turned slightly, 
her face now visible, and Lisa gasped. Those eyes. There was nothing 
human in those brilliant sapphires &#150; or perhaps, too human. Even as she 
looked at the young woman before her, Lisa had no way to describe the 
awesome, terrifying power radiating from that gaze. It was regal and yet 
primal, almost feral, a supernatural darkness so deep there was no way 
for anyone not connected to it to ever comprehend. Those were the eyes 
of a goddess, an immortal harbinger of death, lovely and deadly as a 
viper. Or perhaps, Lisa thought after a breathless pause, the viper was 
better compared to her.

The blonde Corsican looked at them calmly, and Breffort had the 
momentary impression of a lioness judging whether or not they were worth 
the trouble of killing. It was a slow, almost negligent look, but 
blazingly intense. He spared a moment of regret that he had dragged Lisa 
along on this errand of foolish mercy; if he was about to die, he didn&#39;t 
want his niece to be destroyed with him. Then Mirelle blinked once, 
recognition entering her face, though her eyes stayed the same flat 
coldness. &quot;I want to know where she is.&quot;

&quot;You mean Kirika?&quot; Remy paused. Alexander would not have brought Kirika 
with him, of course, it wasn&#39;t intelligent. But finding out where he had 
put the young woman was going to be difficult. Even if they had all the 
time in the world, which the silver-haired Soldat was very sure they did 
not. &quot;We&#39;re not sure yet &#150; my men are working on it at the moment.&quot;

Mirelle watched him for a moment more, absolutely silent, her face 
impossible to read.

&quot;The old Manor house in the Chez district.&quot; Lisa&#39;s voice was even softer 
than her uncle&#39;s, but it had an unmistakable ring of truth. She really 
didn&#39;t want to call attention to herself; she knew for a fact that if 
Mirelle decided to kill her, she might not even see the attack coming 
before she died. &quot;He used to live there when I knew him, and its where 
most of the guards has been moving. There&#39;s forty or fifty of them by 
now, maybe more.&quot;

The Corsican assassin watched them both for a few more seconds, then 
nodded once, slowly. Silent, she turned toward the street where her car 
must have been parked. Lisa hesitated, then called out again.

&quot;Noir?&quot; Not Mirelle &#150; whoever, whatever this person was, she was not the 
Mirelle that Lisa knew. This was one half of Noir, the deadliest 
assassin in the world.

The taller blonde turned, one eyebrow rising, and caught the two long, 
black rectangles Lisa tossed her way. &quot;It was all the ammo we had for a 
Walter.&quot; Lisa explained, almost shyly.

Something that might have been a faint echo of Mirelle&#39;s trademark smirk 
curled at the corners of the Corsican&#39;s lips, and she nodded again, 
turning back toward the car. Lisa and her uncle watched her go, each 
stalking stride a flowing example of liquid grace. Breathless, the 
Soldats young woman shook her head slightly, overwhelmed with too many 
emotions to name. &quot;I hope she finds Kirika.&quot; She whispered, almost to 
herself.

&quot;If you have to wonder, my dear, you do not know them as I do.&quot; 
Surprised, Lisa looked up at her uncle as he patted her shoulder softly. 
Breffort&#39;s smile was deeply sad. &quot;The two of them belong to each other. 
There is nothing to fear.&quot;

Nothing to fear &#150; Lisa glanced at the lifeless bodies littering the 
ground around them and shuddered, remembering the terrifying power that 
had stared from Mirelle&#39;s eyes. Such pure, bloodsoaked darkness, without 
morals or emotions or any humanity &#150; such a thing was unthinkable. And 
the High Council had deliberately made Mirelle and Kirika into these 
weapons? &quot;How &#150; how could anyone do something like that?&quot; The words 
exploded from her in a low hiss. &quot;How could anyone make another person 
into something so monsterous? A child!&quot;

She met her uncle&#39;s eyes and saw the deep, gentle understanding there. 
&quot;Now you know, my darling. You know why I would do anything I can to 
take care of them.&quot; His voice was quiet, solemn. &quot;Years ago, I was 
relieved that Altena refused to allow your blessing by the High Priest. 
She refused because she feared it would give the Council more power over 
the Saplings.&quot;

&quot;And you?&quot;

Breffort sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t know myself. Not until the day I saw those 
two incredible young women limping from the Manor, and Mirelle herself 
told me that they would always seek the light. If they forged in the 
fires of Hell itself could show kindness or find love, who are we to 
stop them?&quot;

Silence hung heavy for a few more moments before Lisa nodded, slowly. 
&quot;So what do we do, Uncle?&quot;

&quot;For now, we get the cleanup crew here.&quot; Breffort smiled, ruffling her 
bangs affectionately before reaching for his cell phone. &quot;Then we go 
home and get back to work. When the girls are ready, they will need to 
know who was behind Alexander, and we will have that information for 
them.&quot;

Lisa nodded again, wandering through the bodies as her uncle began 
dialing the required numbers. Soldats had their own private clean-up 
detail, of course; by the time any police got here, there wouldn&#39;t even 
be bloodstains to mark the ground. Breffort&#39;s voice murmured quietly in 
the background, and Lisa noticed a familiar body sprawled on the 
pavement, slightly beyond the rest of the corpses. Alexander. He lay on 
his back, dead eyes open and staring sightlessly up at the sky, a mess 
of blood and bruises punctuated sharply by a hole in his forehead. She 
supposed she should close his eyes, show some respect for the dead. It 
was the proper thing to do, after all.

His body made a meaty, shuffling thunk noise as she kicked him in the 
groin. &quot;Bastard.&quot; She muttered, turning away. She strode back to her 
uncle&#39;s side, not even bothering to look back.

They had work to do.

Did I mention I love Lisa too? xD</pre>
