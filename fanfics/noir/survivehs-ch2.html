<h1>Kirika Survives High School (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bulmafox.html">Bulmafox</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/survivehs-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;&#39;Hello, my name&#39;s Yuumura Kirika. What&#39;s your name, birthdate, and 
blood type?&#39;&quot;

&quot;No no no, Kirika,&quot; Mireille corrected. &quot;Don&#39;t be so formal. You&#39;re 
going to a party, not a wake. And we don&#39;t ask people&#39;s blood types in 
France.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Sorry. Hello--&#39;&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t use &#39;hello&#39;. Use &#39;hi&#39;; it&#39;s a lot more casual.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Hi, my name&#39;s Yuumura Kirika. What&#39;s your name?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Use just your first name. We&#39;re not in Japan. The French aren&#39;t nearly 
so formal.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Hi, my name&#39;s Kirika. What&#39;s you name?&#39; Is that good?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a start.&quot;

&quot;Now what? What do I say after that?&quot;

&quot;Tell them a little about yourself.&quot;

&quot;Like what? Am I supposed to just walk up to someone and say &#39;Hello. My 
name&#39;s Kirika. I kill people in my spare time&#39;?&quot;

Mireille chuckled. &quot;No, not quite. How about this: What did you tell 
Milosh when you met him?&quot;

Kirika grimaced for a second before answering. &quot;I told him his painting 
was good.&quot;

&quot;So think up a reason to talk at the party.&quot;

&quot;But what if I say the wrong thing?&quot; 

&quot;This is why you mingle.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Mingle&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yes, mingle. Walk amongst the crowd until you hear something that 
interests you, then butt in.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that...rude?&quot;

&quot;Kirika, you kill people. I think being rude is the least of your 
worries.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;Now let&#39;s review. I&#39;m a total stranger at a party and I&#39;m schmoozing 
with some random people. Make conversation with me.&quot; Mireille moved to 
the opposite side of the room and pretended to talk.

Kirika made her way tentatively across the room. As she got closer, she 
could hear Mireille say. &quot;...and yesterday, my cat totally made me 
spill my soda on my keyboard. I swear, that cat&#39;s such a pain...&quot;

&quot;Um, excuse me. My name&#39;s Kirika. I used to have a cat named Prince 
Myshki...I feel stupid.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t me. I can&#39;t just walk up to people and make small talk.&quot;

Mireille thought for a minute. &quot;...Do you talk to anyone at school yet?&quot;

&quot;That Guy Sans-Visage guy.&quot;

&quot;Good. Get him to scout for you. Make him find someone who likes Japan, 
cats, amnesia, whatever, then have him introduce you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know him that well. Do I tell him &#39;Guy, find out what lesbian 
amnesiac killers like to talk about?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Well you have to start *somewhere*.&quot;

&quot;...Let&#39;s try the small talk thing again.&quot;

*********************************************************************

Kirika walked into class repeating something to herself. She had stayed 
up with Mireille most of the night learning to socialize, and she 
could&#39;ve sworn she went to sleep repeating the same things she was now. 
She stopped long enough to see Vache was in the same seat he was in 
yesterday. She sat in a corner seat in the front row, as far away from 
him as possible. She resumed her recitation.

&quot;Yo, SM, what&#39;cha talking about?&quot; A cheery voice said beside her. She 
turned and saw a playful looking guy wearing a long, blonde bowl cut 
sitting beside her, and inwardly groaned. &quot;Vache, what do you want?&quot;

&quot;Hey now, is that any way to treat your friend?&quot;

&quot;So now we&#39;re friends?&quot;

&quot;My we&#39;re being snarky today. I didn&#39;t mean to be a jerk in gym 
yesterday. Friends?&quot; He held out his hand.

Kirika just looked at it. &quot;You only changed your tune because I won.&quot;

&quot;What can I say? I know when I&#39;m beaten.&quot;

She looked away.

&quot;Fine. You&#39;re strong and you belong in the men&#39;s class. That better?&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot;

&quot;Look, why are you so mad? I goof around like this all the time.&quot;

&quot;I know. Guy told me.&quot;

&quot;Then he must&#39;ve told you I&#39;m not a mean person. I don&#39;t do things to 
hurt people, especially people I like.&quot;

&quot;Well you really loved me yesterday.&quot; *You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re still 
living.*

&quot;Look, can we just drop it? Let&#39;s start again, okay? My name&#39;s Vache. 
Vache Guimauve.&quot; He kept his hand out.

&quot;Yuumura Kirika, and if you ever pull a prank on me again like you did 
yesterday, you might not be able to regret it.&quot;

&quot;Uh...sure...whatever that means. You watch Golgo 13?...Ooh, here&#39;s the 
teach. Gotta go.&quot; Vache scurried back to his desk.

*********************************************************************

Time went way too fast for Kirika&#39;s liking today. Gym class was 
particularly unpleasant. Not because of the three or so boys who jeered 
her when she walked in, or the coach who piled on extra work because he 
heard she won that bet. Kirika didn&#39;t mind that; she needed to keep in 
shape and burn off all that pent-up energy. It was the fact that all 
the work made her lose track of time. By the time class was done, it 
had felt like only ten minutes had passed.

The rest of the school day wasn&#39;t much better. During English and Study 
Hall, she made the mistake of doing her homework, which gave her 
something to focus on, which only sped up time for her. Before she knew 
it, she was back home, preparing for the party.

***********************************************************************

&quot;Well, we&#39;re here,&quot; Mireille said as she looked at the house in front 
of her, then the directions Kirika had gotten from Guy yesterday, then 
up again.

&quot;Yes, we are.&quot;

Mireille squeezed Kirika&#39;s hand. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika said.

&quot;Tell me how it goes.&quot; Mireille kissed Kirika before leaving. &quot;We&#39;ll 
talk over dinner.&quot;

&quot;Bye,&quot; Kirika said softly. She walked up the stairs and into the house, 
feeling as ready as she ever would. She took in her surroundings as she 
entered the back room.

It all looked...overwhelming. There was a large crowd of people 
socialzing then the center of the room, some chairs against a wall and 
a buffet-like table--tub of drinks and all--against the other wall. 
Kirika spotted a garden on the far side of the room, jammed with more 
people socializing and drinking. She could hear strange music--music 
she&#39;d never heard before--playing at full blast, coming from some place 
she couldn&#39;t see.

She looked around at the various groups of people and tried to find one 
to butt into. She edged along the wall, and listened in.

&quot;Hey, I just got this incredibly cute Duvoir shirt..you&#39;ll never 
believe how much it cost!&quot;

&quot;Oh really? Well I just got the latest from Milan...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Mireille&#39;s territory.&quot; Kirika thought as she moved on. *She 
should&#39;ve come.*

&quot;Hey, d&#39;ya know how many grunts I killed?&quot; A guy near her said.

Kirika&#39;s ears perked up.

&quot;Yeah I know. They fall so easily,&quot; his friend added.

&quot;Um...you kill people?&quot; Kirika asked them.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; the first one said, &quot;You play Half-Life 5?&quot;

&quot;Half-Life 5?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s like the programmers put it on Extra Easy mode. It only 
takes one shot to off the targets this time.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s a game?&quot;

&quot;Duh. Where&#39;ve you been hiding, under a rock?&quot;

Kirika heard the boys laugh and call her &quot;Weirdo,&quot; as she slinked away.
 
She sat down in a chair against the wall after a while, having found no 
one to talk to. Worse, everyone seemed to have known each other from 
childhood, which would&#39;ve made it harder to jump in even if they had 
been talking about stuff she knew. She leaned back and observed the 
crowd, wondering why she came at all.

Guy walked up to her holding a can of soda and smiled. &quot;Hey Kirika. 
How&#39;s the party?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have come.&quot;

&quot;Aw, come on, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do just fine.&quot;

&quot;But I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t do just fine. I don&#39;t know how to do this.&quot;

&quot;You mean socialize?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Mireille taught me but it&#39;s still so hard.&quot;

Guy gave her a questioning look for a second when she said Mireille, 
then sat down and said, &quot;Do you want to know something about me? 
Something that may surprise you?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I used to be just like you.....don&#39;t look like that, I really did.&quot;

&quot;You mean socially?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. When we--my parents and I--moved here I was a wreck. I had a 
circle of really good friends in Belgium and I never really had to deal 
with strangers. Then we moved here and my whole life was uprooted. I 
suddenly realized I didn&#39;t know how to make friends; I was so 
introverted. I only had friends in my old home because we&#39;d known each 
other since we were five.&quot;

Kirika looked wistful; she didn&#39;t even have that. &quot;So what did you do?&quot;

&quot;I met Vache. He was so playful and funny and outgoing...everything I 
was not. And he became my best friend. He taught me how to be open, 
sociable, all that good stuff.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So all I need is an outgoing friend.&quot;

&quot;Not necessarily. But that&#39;s what worked for me.&quot; He sighed and got up. 
&quot;And now I have to socialize; after all,that&#39;s what hosts are supposed 
to do. I must remember to pay Vache back for that one.&quot;

&quot;Guy,&quot; Kirika asked tentatively, &quot;Can I come too?&quot;

&quot;What? Sure.&quot; Guy started making his rounds, with Kirika close behind. 
&quot;Anyway, this party was mostly Vache&#39;s idea. I thought of the concept 
and bought the drinks; he dared me to do it and attracted the people,&quot; 
he chuckled, &quot;With free drinks, mostly booze.&quot;    

He approached the first group he saw and asked them things like, &quot;How&#39;s 
the party?&quot; &quot;Hey, you look nice&quot;, and &quot;So, what&#39;s up?&quot; Kirika stood 
right behind Guy, observing their reactions.

As they walked to the next group, he asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you introduce 
yourself?&quot;

&quot;...I didn&#39;t know what to say.&quot;

&quot;Start with your name.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and then?&quot;

&quot;Then say whatever comes to mind. Try it next time.&quot;

*Easy for you to say.* &quot;Okay.&quot;

At the next group of people, after Guy finished his small talk, Kirika 
said tentatively, &quot;Um..my name&#39;s Kirika. How are you?&quot; to all of them.

One of them answered. &quot;I&#39;m Marco. Hey, you like video games?&quot;

&quot;Uh...I haven&#39;t played any.&quot;

&quot;Not even Mario?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Man are you weird. Everyone&#39;s played Mario.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she likes girly stuff,&quot; one of the girls argued.

&quot;But I don&#39;t dress frilly or wear make up,&quot; Kirika said.

&quot;Well then, what do you like?&quot; a third one asked.

&quot;Um....cats?&quot;

&quot;Dog lover here,&quot; he said.

&quot;Iguanas.&quot;

&quot;Snakes.&quot;

&quot;Ooh ooh I like cats!&quot; Another girl shouted. &quot;Don&#39;tcha hate it when 
jump up on your desk and knock down your stuff?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s never happened...that I can remember. I...um...found one in the 
dumpster one time.&quot;

&quot;Oh, the poor thing. What&#39;d you do?&quot;

&quot;I took it with me.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;And....it...ran away.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, see ya later then.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Kirika said as she and Guy walked away.

&quot;I see what you mean. I could see the discomfort on your face,&quot; he 
said. &quot;You&#39;re not mainstream.&quot;

&quot;Not normal, you mean,&quot; she said to herself.

&quot;Hey, I heard that. Ooh, I know. Vache!&quot; he called out as he dragged 
Kirika across the room.

Vache finished his can of beer and said, &quot;Hey, Guillaume! SM!&quot;

Guy flinched upon hearing that name. &quot;You know I hate that name.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know. So what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Kirika&#39;s having trouble mingling.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What&#39;cha need help on? Introductions? Small talk? Taking out the 
enemy and flinging yourself out the nearest escape hatch when it all 
goes horribly wrong?&quot; 

Kirika looked quite puzzled. &quot;Huh?!...I guess everything.&quot;

&quot;Everything what? I need specifics here. Give me specifics.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not mainstream.&quot;

Vache chuckled. &quot;Oh is that it? Well to tell you the truth, normal is 
boring. Now shooting up the enemy on the screen and getting 
brain-breaking anime, that&#39;s exciting. Come this way.&quot;

&quot;Wait, where&#39;re we going?&quot;

&quot;To watch Eva. You seem like the dark, brooding type. Eva&#39;s perfect for 
you. Afterwards we can down a couple of bottles of Prozac and discuss 
the significance of Instrumentality while trying not to slit our 
wrists.&quot;

Kirika looked at Vache like he&#39;d grown three heads.

&quot;Just kidding about the Prozac part. Serious about the rest.&quot;

&quot;Vache,&quot; Guy scolded, &quot;She&#39;s new. We don&#39;t need to traumatize the poor 
girl yet. At least not now.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Kirika said.

Vache made a pouty face. &quot;Oh fine. Hey! .hack//SIGN! You&#39;ll love 
.hack//SIGN! Tsukasa is so dark and broody...you&#39;ll love him!&quot;

Guy slapped his palm to his face. &quot;Why do you have to scare everyone 
away like that?&quot;

&quot;What? You&#39;d rather me show her Sailor Moon? That&#39;s kids&#39; stuff.&quot;

Guy made a flat face. &quot;That didn&#39;t stop *you* from watching it.&quot;

&quot;Hey, sometimes you need a little shoujo in your life.&quot;

&quot;And I thought *I* was not normal,&quot; Kirika commented.

&quot;Hey, you don&#39;t get this trippy by going to bed at eight, ya know.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; She asked.

&quot;You know, going to bed at four a.m. and stuff--&quot; he stopped and turned 
his head when he realized Kirika was looking over his shoulder. He saw 
two girls--on with mid-length blonde hair and glasses, one with long 
brown hair--barreling their way toward her, both wearing purple cat 
hats and carrying purple boxes. They swept Kirika up and took her 
somewhere secluded before she knew what hit her.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; both guys shouted.

&quot;Hey, stop squirming!&quot; the blonde one said. &quot;We&#39;re not gonna hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; the brunette said, holding on tightly to Kirika&#39;s arms while 
the blonde one held her feet, &quot;It&#39;s getting hard to carry you!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the point!&quot; Kirika yelled. &quot;What are you do--oh!&quot; She said as 
they dumped her on the floor. One of then sat on her arms, one sat on 
her legs, and they both took out what looked like cloth and makeup from 
the boxes. The blonde one started messing with Kirika&#39;s face as Kirika 
squirmed violently. &quot;Calm down, I said we weren&#39;t going to hurt you.&quot;

Kirika relaxed on cue. Then she groped the brunette&#39;s butt. She yelped 
and stood up, and Kirika took that chance to free herself.

&quot;Goddess she&#39;s getting loose, Raist! Get her!&quot;

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t,&quot; Raist said. She wrapped her arms around Kirika and 
gave her a bear hug while the blonde girl painted something on Kirika&#39;s 
face. When they got done, they packed their stuff and skipped off, 
yelling, &quot;You have just been glamourbombed! Have a nice day!&quot;

Kirika stopped in her tracks, disarmed by this new word. 
&quot;Glamour...bombed...?&quot;

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Vache shouted as he and Guy found her. &quot;Are you all 
ri..hehe..&quot;

&quot;How adorable,&quot; Guy crooned.

&quot;Can I touch &#39;em?&quot; Vache asked. He reached for Kirika&#39;s hair, and she 
moved away. &quot;...But they&#39;re so cute!&quot;

Guy held up a hand as if it were a cat paw. &quot;Meow meow.&quot;

&quot;What? What happened to me? Why am I so cute?&quot; Kirika asked.

&quot;You need a mirror. This way.&quot; Vache pushed Kirika to the nearest 
mirror, which was, unfortunately, in a small, private alcove on the 
opposite side of the room. Kirika saw everyone making cat paws and 
meowing at her, and she looked down in embarrassment.

When they got there, she looked at her reflection and got what everyone 
was crooning over. The glamourbombers had painted a black cat nose, a 
line from her nose to her mouth, long whiskers, and freckles on her 
cheeks. They had also put a lavender hat with cat ears--exactly like 
the ones they wore--on her head. She blushed heavily and looked down.

&quot;Aw, don&#39;t be embarrassed. You&#39;re the talk of the party now.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be the talk of the party.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re so *kyoot!*&quot; He tried squeezing her cat ears, but she moved 
away again. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get back to the party. At least now you have 
something to talk about.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot; Kirika and Vache left the alcove and everyone started 
meowing again. Kirika bowed her head, then remembered something very 
important. *I stood up to the Soldats, the Knights of Paris, Chloe, and 
Altena. I can stand up to this.* She looked up, plastered on the 
biggest smile she could muster, and waved.

A girl walked up to her and said, &quot;Hey, meow meow.&quot;

&quot;Meow meow,&quot; Kirika replied.

Another girl crooned, &quot;That is so cute! I want one!&quot;

&quot;Um..I didn&#39;t do this. They--&quot; She looked around for her assailants, 
but they were nowhere to be found. &quot;...I didn&#39;t do this.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s still cool. Can I follow you around?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Aw why not? I&#39;ll be good.&quot;

&quot;Because I would feel uncomfortable.&quot;

The girl made a pouty face as Kirika made her way back to her seat, 
where she stayed until the end of the party. Every so often someone 
would approach her and tell her how cute her catwear was or how they 
loved cats. She even got an impromptu proposal, which she rejected on 
the spot, leaving the poor boy running to the restroom, on the verge of 
tears. And every so often Vache and Guy would check up on her, then go 
back to mingling.

Eventually, the music died down and all but a few people left. Guy sat 
down next to Kirika and asked, &quot;So, are you glad you came?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Is this what being Miss Popular is like?&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know, seeing I&#39;m a man, but yeah, that&#39;s being popular 
for ya. I&#39;m not a big fan of popularity, but Vache eats it up like 
candy. Look at him.&quot; Vache was doing some crazy antic or other in front 
of a small group. &quot;Hey Vache,&quot; he called, &quot;You gonna help me clean up 
or what?&quot;

&quot;Yeah I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m coming.&quot; He finished his antic and grabbed a 
trash bag.

&quot;Can I help?&quot; Kirika asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Guy said. &quot;The more the merrier.&quot;

&quot;And then we can plaster ourselves stupid.&quot; Vache pointed to a large 
crate of alcohol.

Kirika just stared at him.

&quot;His idea!&quot; Both men shouted as they pointed at each other.

*******************************************************************  

&quot;So are we having fun yet?&quot; Guy asked as he gulped down another beer. 
They had long since finished cleaning up and were now cleaning off the 
crate of drinks.

&quot;Whoo! This is more fun that seeing people pop to Tang!&quot; Vache slurred.

&quot;What?&quot; Kirika asked as she packed away a fruit mixer; she had tasted 
everything in sight until she found a type of drink she liked.

&quot;End of Eva. It&#39;s really a mind breaker.&quot;

&quot;...Can they turn into soda too?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; one of the other guys, the pudgy one with spiky black hair, said, 
&quot;But it would sure be fun!&quot; He high-fived the man next to him.

&quot;Yeah Marc! Carbonated people!&quot; The man he high-fived, the one with 
long shaggy brown hair and glasses, yelled.

&quot;Claude! Soylent Green!&quot; Guy yelled. &quot;Soylent Green is people!&quot;

&quot;Another Brick in the Wall!&quot; Vache yelled. &quot;These people,&quot; he explained 
to Kirika, &quot;Are led to a meat grinder and turned into meat.&quot; He 
shivered. &quot;Ooh, gruesome!...Mental image! Where&#39;s the bleach?

&quot;Not more gruesome,&quot; Kirika said, &quot;Than gutting a man with a toy bus or 
hanging one with his own tie. Or forking your only friend. With an 
olive fork, no less.&quot;

&quot;Ew, you&#39;re scary. Remind me not to get you mad.&quot; 

&quot;What?! I...uh...picked it up...from...the Net!&quot; Kirika spit out.

&quot;No no no,&quot; Vache corrected, &quot;Not the Net...The Wired. And I&#39;m the 
Lain.&quot; Everyone but Kirika burst into laughter.

&quot;Yo Kirara--&quot; Marc asked.

&quot;Kirara!&quot; Vache howled with laughter. &quot;It so fits!&quot;

Kirika gave him a strange look.

&quot;Kirara&#39;s a cat. On...dog-demon or other. You&#39;re a cat too. Mew-mew.&quot;

Kirika felt her cat ears. &quot;Right. Mew-mew. Mrrow! I&#39;m Princess Myshkin.&quot;

&quot;So you like Doy--Do--aw that Russian guy?&quot;

&quot;You mean Nazarov? That was his kitty; Prince Myshkin.&quot;

&quot;No no no, the author....um...what&#39;s his name?&quot;

&quot;Doystilevski?&quot; Marc asked.

&quot;Duskiyavski?&quot; Claude asked. 

&quot;Dumbeldorff!&quot; Guy yelled.

&quot;Ew ew ew,&quot; Vache yelled. &quot;I need the bleach! Where&#39;s the bleach?! I 
need to clean my brain out!&quot;  

&quot;Here I&#39;ll get it!&quot; Kirika volunteered. She stood up and promptly sat 
back down and held her head. &quot;Or not. Is the room really spinning?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a kaleidyscope! An&#39; it&#39;s all your fault!&quot; Vache yelled at 
Guy.

&quot;It&#39;s not my fault! It&#39;s...it&#39;s...Harry Potter&#39;s!&quot; He pointed to a 
random spot in the room.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t blame it on him. He has enough pr..problems!&quot; He turned 
around and said, &quot;Hey Kirara, look out, &#39;cause Guy&#39;s turning into...the 
Megazord!&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Guy stood up and slammed his beer. He then leaned against 
his chair, holding his head. &quot;You invoked the almighty Megazord! You 
killed this argument! I&#39;m going home! Let&#39;s go Kirika.&quot; He pulled her 
up, and she fell into his arms.

&quot;But you can&#39;t go,&quot; Marc said. &quot;You live here. Or do you?&quot;

&quot;.....Oh....then I&#39;m takin&#39; her home. An&#39; not even the almighty 
Megazord can stop me.&quot; He stomped slowly and deliberately out of the 
room.

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Vache called after him. &quot;Well rawr rawr to you too!&quot;

&quot;Mew mew everyone! Mrrow mrrow!&quot; Kirika called as she slumped out with 
Guy. &quot;Moww!  

****************************************************************

Guy and Kirika slumped up the stairs leading to her apartment. Guy 
knocked on the door weakly and they leaned on the opposite wall. He 
jumped when he saw Mireille&#39;s expression.

&quot;Oh God, Kirika. What have you done to her?!&quot; She demanded of Guy.

&quot;..She got glamourbombed. Isn&#39;t she just cute--oops,&quot; Guy said as
Mireille cut him off with her stare. &quot;Well...I think I better go now.&quot;

Mireille grabbed Kirika and said in a low voice, &quot;Yeah, I think you
better,&quot; before he scampered off.
 
&quot;Mrow!&quot; Kirika yelled after him.
 
She led Kirika inside and slammed the door. &quot;Kirika, what were you 
thinking, drinking that much?&quot;

&quot;Well...everyone else...was doin&#39; it...and there was...nothin&#39; 
else...to do--Mireille, the bathroom!&quot; Mireille rushed her to the 
bathroom, and Kirika clung to the toilet like she was drowning. 
&quot;Mireille, kill me now.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;I said kill me!&quot; Kirika moaned. &quot;I want this to end!&quot;

Mireille stifled a chuckle as she slipped out. &quot;Just let yourself vomit 
and I promise you&#39;ll feel better.&quot;

&quot;I better!&quot; Kirika yelled after her.

After Kirika got done throwing up as much as she felt she would, 
Mireille came back in. &quot;So, how do you feel?&quot;
 
Kirika was still hunched over the toilet. &quot;Dizzy. I think I&#39;m gonna 
faint.&quot; Her head drooped.

&quot;Kirika!&quot;

She lifted her head a second later. &quot;I&#39;m back.&quot;

&quot;Thank god.&quot; Mireille pried Kirika off the toilet and put a damp 
washcloth on her head. &quot;You&#39;re going to bed.&quot; She lifted Kirika up and 
dragged her out.

&quot;With you?&quot; Kirika asked in a hopeful voice.

&quot;What?&quot; She cleared her throat. &quot;Um, sure. You *do* mean for sleeping, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

Kirika giggled. &quot;No, silly. I mean for sex.&quot;

Mireille nearly dropped her. &quot;What?! Where&#39;d you pick that up?&quot;

&quot;Myself. I want your body, silly.&quot;     

&quot;Uh boy,&quot; Mireille said under her breath. &quot;You&#39;re drunk. Let&#39;s get you 
to bed. And by bed I mean sleep.&quot;

&quot;Aw why can&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Because.&quot; Mireille dropped Kirika off, tucked her in, and brought her 
an empty bowl. Then she climbed in next to her and wrapped her arms 
around her. &quot;Now get to sleep.&quot; Right before Kirika drifted off to 
sleep Mireille said, &quot;You know, you really do look cute in that.&quot;

**********************************************************************

Kirika woke up feeling like a bunch of sledgehammers were pounding on 
her head.&quot; She opened one eye and promptly closed it, blinded by the 
sunlight. &quot;Mireille, what...happened? Why am I here?&quot; She turned over. 
&quot;Mireille? Mireille.&quot; She shook the older woman awake. &quot;Mireille, what 
happened?&quot;

Mireille yawned. &quot;You&#39;re up. And I bet you feel horrible.&quot;

&quot;I have this headache...and it hurts to open my eyes...Mireille, what 
time is it?&quot;

Mireille looked at the clock. &quot;Seven thirty. A.M. You slept a long 
time.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Kirika jumped out of bed and instantly regretted doing so. 
&quot;I&#39;m late! I have to go, now!&quot; She picked up her laptop and bolted out 
of the room.

&quot;Kirika!&quot;

She stopped. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;At least take something.&quot; Mireille poked around and produced a bottle 
of pain reliever. She dumped two in Kirika&#39;s hand. &quot;Here.&quot;

Kirika took them both, without water. She got them down--with great 
effort and wincing on her part--as she rushed out the door.

**********************************************************************

Kirika ran in just as the bell rang. A few students &#39;mew-mew&#39;ed at her, 
and she realizes she still had on all her catwear. She slid into the 
desk right in front of Vache shortly beofre the bell rang.

&quot;Yo, Sleeping Beauty,&quot; he greeted. &quot;Get enough sleep?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She lay her head down. &quot;I want to go back to sleep.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You still hung over?&quot;

&quot;Hung over?&quot; Kirika muttered.

&quot;Ya know, killer headache, that I-just-ate-the-school&#39;s-burritos 
nausea, the bright lights--&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that.&quot;

&quot;Well enjoy the ride. It&#39;s a fun one.&quot;

&quot;Not to me.&quot;

&quot;And try to stay awake. Here&#39;s the teach.&quot;

**********************************************************************

By the time Computer class rolled around, Kirika&#39;s headache was mostly 
gone, thanks to the painkillers. Her hypersensitivity to light had 
vanished, too, and she even felt like keeping her head up. She had also 
lost the cat hat and washed off the makeup. Kirika tried to concentrate 
on her latest project when someone hissed at her.

&quot;Hey,&quot; the girl next to her whispered. &quot;Do you have an extra disk?&quot;

Kirika just stared at her, swearing she looked familiar. Dark blonde 
hair, down a little past her shoulders, energetic blue eyes, oval 
glasses--Kirika gasped and backed up. &quot;You&#39;re the glamourbomber! It&#39;s 
you!&quot;

&quot;Ssh! Not so loud. I take it you liked our little surprise?&quot;

&quot;Miss Revenchatte, Miss Yuumura, save the chatting for later. Get back 
to work!&quot; The teacher rapped.

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; They said in unison as they hunched over their computers. 
The rest of the class snickered.

&quot;And that goes for the rest of you too!&quot;

The students quickly fell silent.  

****************************************************************

&quot;Hey, cute girl!&quot; The blonde called out from across the lunchroom as 
she walked toward Kirika. &quot;Hey don&#39;t walk away!&quot; She yelled as Kirika 
stood up.

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Why are you so mad? You *did* like the catwear, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that. You assaulted me.&quot; She started to walk away.

The blonde grabbed her arm. &quot;Assaulted you? Moi? We just added a little 
fun to your life, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Kirika yanked her arm away. &quot;I have touch issues. I&#39;ve had...bad 
experiences.&quot;

She backed away. &quot;Oh. I didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well now you do.&quot;

&quot;Wait, don&#39;t go. Let&#39;s start over. My name&#39;s Sprite. Sprite 
Revenchatte. I&#39;m new here; I just moved from England.&quot;

Kirika looked at her for a moment, then said, &quot;Yuumura Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Come on, sit down. I promise I won&#39;t touch you.&quot;

She sat down slowly, not taking her eyes off Sprite.

&quot;I promise!&quot; She held up her hands. &quot;Look, no touchy. So, touch issues 
notwithstanding, did you like the catwear?&quot;

&quot;It was...embarrassing.&quot;

&quot;But it was so cute! You were the talk of the party!&quot;

&quot;And that made me feel awkward.&quot;

&quot;Well we&#39;ll just have to get you out there, socializing.&quot;

&quot;Guy&#39;s helping me do that.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, your boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;Just my friend.&quot; It felt odd to Kirika, saying &#39;friend&#39;. &quot;I don&#39;t have 
a boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s where you disappeared to!&quot; said a brunette who just
walked up to them. She playfully slapped Sprite&#39;s arm. &quot;Don&#39;t leave me
like that! It&#39;s rude.&quot; She sat down next to Sprite. Kirika scooted away 
from her.

&quot;OH, she didn&#39;t know either,&quot; Sprite said quickly.

&quot;Know what?&quot;

Sprite mock-whispered. &quot;She has touch issues.&quot;

&quot;Well then,&quot; she said as she bowed, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;

Sprite kicked her ankle. &quot;Say it like you mean it.&quot;

The brunette giggled. &quot;I *do* mean it.&quot; She turned to Kirika, who had 
stopped scooting. &quot;Don&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t sound sincere.&quot;

&quot;Aw, that hurt. So what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Yuumura Kirika,&quot; Sprite said.

&quot;I&#39;m Raist,&quot; she told Kirika.

&quot;And?&quot; Kirika asked.

&quot;And nice to meet you. I&#39;m new; I just moved from America.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t believe how long it took her to learn French,&quot; Sprite
added.

&quot;Oh really? I thought *you* were the slow learner.&quot;

&quot;Then why were you calling in the middle of the night? &#39;Sprite tell
me how to say cow in French&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I just missed talking to you, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll...just leave you two...&quot; Kirika spit out.

&quot;No!&quot; They both yelled.

Raist said, &quot;We didn&#39;t mean to exclude you. Stay here. So, what do
you like?&quot;

&quot;Like?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Intrests and all that.&quot;

Kirika recited off the top of her head, &quot;Cats, looking out windows,
painting, and Japan.&quot;

&quot;Ooh,&quot; both of them swooned, &quot;We love Japan!&quot;

&quot;You too?&quot;

&quot;Who else does?&quot; asked Sprite.

&quot;Guy.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s Guy?&quot; Raist asked.

&quot;My friend.&quot;

&quot;So are you from Japan?&quot;

&quot;...Yes.&quot; It was close enough to the truth; she had actually
awakened there.

&quot;Cool!&quot; they both crooned again.

&quot;You said you like cats,&quot; Sprite said. &quot;Did you ever own one?&quot;

&quot;For a short time. Then he went back to his owner.&quot;

&quot;At least he has a home.&quot;

Kirika stayed silent.

&quot;So do you have a boyfriend?&quot; Raist asked.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;How &#39;bout a girlfriend?&quot; Sprite asked. 
 
&quot;Yes. Is that...wrong?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s not wrong at all. I have a girlfriend, too.&quot; She glanced 
at Raist. 

&quot;Who, her?&quot;

&quot;Of course. We met about six months ago and we couldn&#39;t be closer.&quot; 
Sprite glanced around and saw people deserting the cafeteria. &quot;Look, 
tell us about your girlfriend after school, okay? Meet us at Jean 
Luc&#39;s.&quot; She pulled out a piece of paper, scribbled the address down, 
and gave it to Kirika before they parted ways.

Don&#39;t take everything I write about these characters to be gospel
truth about their real selves. While I try to nail them down as much
as possible, there are things I&#39;ll have to make up, such as Sprite and
Raist&#39;s French learning experience. ^_^

There really is a book called &quot;The Idiot&quot; by Dostoevsky, and it stars a 
man named Prince Myshkin.</pre>
