<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>I can sense the activity in the apartment before I even open the door. 
Henry practically opens it for me, beckoning me inside with a nod of his 
head. I walk in, Uncle following me slowly. The steps were hard on him, 
but he insisted on coming in with me.

&quot;Where&#39;s Mireille?&quot; I ask Henry.

&quot;Packing.&quot; He nods his head toward our bedroom.

&quot;Packing?&quot;

&quot;Look at the pool table.&quot; He steps forward, and I follow him. My mouth 
drops open in surprise. I can&#39;t even see the table- it&#39;s covered with 
large bouquets of flowers.

&quot;For her. From him.&quot; Henry shakes his head. &quot;They were on the table when 
we came in.&quot;

&quot;So he&#39;s got the key then.&quot; Uncle rubs his chin with his hand. &quot;They 
must have made a copy when they had Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Lambert.&quot; I swallow the lump of nervousness in my throat. &quot;It had to be 
Lambert.&quot;

&quot;Droger&#39;s as bold as he is arrogant.&quot; Uncle sighs. &quot;Let me see the cards 
on the flowers.&quot;

I turn from the pool table and go into the bedroom. Two bags are open on 
the bed. I see she&#39;s already packed my things, and is rummaging through 
her dresser. I study her, bent over so her long hair hides her face; is 
she as afraid as I am?

&quot;Mireille.&quot; I start, but fall silent. Perhaps it is best not to confess 
my fear.

&quot;We have to go. It&#39;s not safe here.&quot; She turns and busily stuffs her 
bag.

&quot;Where will we hide?&quot; I ask her. I can&#39;t imagine she wants to go with 
Soldats.

&quot;Hide?&quot; she snorts. &quot;We&#39;re not going into hiding.&quot; She picks up the baby 
seal from the dresser and stuffs it into the bag. She zips it shut and 
looks up at me.

&quot;We&#39;re going to the most public place I can find. And I dare him to move 
there.&quot;

----------

I stare out the window at the city below us. The Auberge- I&#39;ve heard of 
it, seen it on the news. A place for the elite, the wealthy, and the 
famous. I never thought that I would be staring out of a penthouse suite 
looking at the lights of Paris.

&quot;How are your eyes? Still seeing spots?&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice is teasing and 
soft. She seems at home already here, staging out areas of the suite for 
her own use.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know there would be paparazzi.&quot; I rub my eyes again.

&quot;They&#39;re crawling all over this place, trying to catch the celebrities. 
Good thing you&#39;re not famous. You&#39;d be blind by now.&quot; She takes my hands 
away and kisses my eyelids. I feel myself relax, and lean into her.

&quot;We&#39;re safe here.&quot; She nuzzles the tops of my head. &quot;Maybe you won&#39;t 
have your nightmares now.&quot;

&quot;That would be nice.&quot; I mumble into her chest. She&#39;s so warm and 
comforting. It&#39;s hard to imagine my life before Mireille.

&quot;Let&#39;s finish unpacking, then we can take a bath together.&quot; She says 
lightly, and I smile. I walk over and get my bag, then stand in front of 
the dresser.

&quot;The dresser is so big.&quot; I say, looking at the shining wood. It towers 
over my head. Everything in the suite is large and expansive; the bed 
here would not even fit into our bedroom at the apartment.

&quot;I&#39;ll navigate that if you want to start the bath.&quot; She taps my shoulder 
and hands me her favorite bubble wash. I nod my head and go into the 
bathroom. It&#39;s huge, big enough to hold our pool table. A giant bathtub 
is elevated on steps in the corner. A quick look at it sends me back to 
the bedroom.

&quot;You better do it.&quot; I hand the bottle back to her.

&quot;Why?&quot; she looks puzzled.

&quot;Because- there&#39;s buttons.&quot; So many of them...this is no ordinary tub, 
and I want nothing to do with it.

&quot;You&#39;ve never seen a jacuzzi?&quot; her voice is incredulous.

I shove the bottle at her, and she begins to laugh. She grabs my face 
and kisses me, still laughing.

&quot;Ok, you unpack, and I&#39;ll start.&quot; She kisses me again, more softly this 
time as she sees the pout on my face. &quot;Silly.&quot;

I ignore her as I hear her walk away, trying not to laugh at me any 
further. I unpack quickly, using only the lower drawers, the ones I can 
reach. We haven&#39;t brought a lot of clothes- I wonder how long we will 
have to stay here.

A strange growling and gurgling sound is now coming from the bathroom. 
It mustn&#39;t be anything dangerous, as I can hear her humming to herself. 
I love when she hums like that; she doesn&#39;t seem to even be aware of it 
at all.

I pull out my sketchbook and the picture of the nightmare room falls 
out, slipping onto the bed. I take it into my hands slowly, turning it 
over, reading the name on the back. Leaving the growling tub sounds 
behind, I exit the bedroom and go into the adjoining office. This suite 
seems to have everything. I find what I&#39;m looking for and go back to the 
bedroom.

I tape the picture to the wall by my side of the bed and then lay 
sideways in the bed, my chin on the edge, staring at my nightmare room.

&quot;Anna.&quot; I whisper, looking at the overturned chair, the open shutters. 
&quot;Where is this place?&quot;

This place....where something terrible happened. I feel it, down to my 
bones.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Mireille&#39;s voice causes me to jump.

&quot;Nothing. Just looking.&quot; I blurt out, rising up to my elbows. I realize 
she&#39;s naked. She stands in front of the picture, blocking it.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you brought that thing with you.&quot; she crosses her arms 
angrily. &quot;Do you want to have more nightmares?&quot;

&quot;No. Of course not.&quot; I frown back at her.

&quot;Good.&quot; she turns and starts to tear it from the wall.

&quot;No!&quot; I lunge forward, grabbing her arm. I slide off the bed, bringing 
her down to the floor with me.

&quot;Kirika- what&#39;s come over you!&quot; her voice is shocked.

I hold the picture up against the wall. A small corner has torn away, 
but I won&#39;t let the picture fall to the ground.

&quot;Let it go, Kirika.&quot; Her voice is softer now, matching the urging look 
in her eyes.

My hand slides back up the wall and I re-fasten the tape. Her eyes 
narrow and she pushes me away from her. She gets up and looks down at 
me.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a bath before it gets cold.&quot; she walks away from me 
and enters the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

&quot;Mireille.&quot; I say to the empty room. I look at the picture again, 
feeling it pulling me in, crushing me.

Let it go.

&quot;I can&#39;t, Mireille.&quot; I whisper. &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;</pre>
