fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;It wasn&#39;t me who suppose to kill her. Rather, it&#39;s you.&quot;

Mireille was sure that those words were meant for her. Yesterday, Chloe 
completely made Mireille felt confused. The blonde was now sitting in 
front her laptop, while gazing at the screen as usual. Why do I have to 
kill Dr. Naomi..? It makes no sense.

The blonde was barely focused though, because she hadn&#39;t slept well last 
night. Sleeping on the sofa was definitely not her type. Plus, Chloe&#39;s 
last words disturbed her goodnight sleep.

Kirika on the other hand, was now busy in the kitchen. She was preparing 
the tea for breakfast. The sound of a door was opened startled Mireille 
a bit. She saw Dr. Naomi in front of her bedroom&#39;s door. The doctor was 
wearing the blue shirt which Mireille put on her last night. Dr. Naomi 
looked tired, tough she was smiling cheerfully.

&quot;Good morning.&quot; The blonde spontaneously said.

Dr. Naomi smiled, &quot;Good morning.&quot;

&quot;Good morning.&quot; A small voice greeted the vet. It was Kirika&#39;s.

&quot;Ah.. Good morning.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s the tea.&quot; Kirika pointed the tea at the table. &quot;Let&#39;s drink it 
together.&quot;

Mireille stood up and walked towards the table. Dr. Naomi followed the 
blonde. A minute after, all of them had sat down and peacefully sipped 
their tea.

Kirika asked softly, &quot;How&#39;s your shoulder?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s better now, thanks to you guys.&quot; answered the vet. She smiled to 
both of them.

&quot;May I ask who injured you last night, doctor..? asked Mireille.

The oldest woman seemed hesitated to answer. &quot;... It was... &quot; She put 
off the cup and said, &quot;I don&#39;t really know myself, actually.&quot;

&quot; I see..&quot; the blonde said.

&quot;It was so dark. I barely saw something, and it turned out that I got 
hit by somebody.&quot; Dr. Naomi said sadly.

Kirika asked softly, &quot;Why were you at that place last night..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi&#39;s eyes grew wider. She seemed surprised by that question, 
tough her expression didn&#39;t show it too much. She looked at Kirika and 
said in a very small voice which barely heard, &quot;I met with someone.&quot;

Mireille and Kirika said nothing after that. Both of them afraid that 
this topic maybe too personal to be asked. They sipped their tea in 
silence after that.

&quot; Ah.. I forgot to thank you girls properly. Thank you for your help. &quot; 
Dr. Naomi smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Mireille said in a tired tone. She felt even more sleepy 
after joining the conversation.

&quot;Mireille.. &quot; a soft voice called out the blonde name.

Mireille almost closed her eyes. &quot;Hmm..?&quot;

&quot;You can use the bed.&quot; Kirika said.

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Mireille stood up while felt sleepy and walked to the 
bed in her room. She slept right away the moment she touched her pillow.

Kirika sipped her tea as Dr. Naomi poured the tea from its pot to her 
cup.

&quot;So, both of you are assassins, right..?&quot; the doctor asked.

Kirika glanced to the female doctor. &quot;.. How do you know..?&quot;

&quot;I just know about it when the two of you rescued me. People always 
compliment my sharp instinct.&quot; The woman smiled cheerfully. &quot;Do you go 
to school, Kirika..?&quot;

&quot;Emm.. No more.&quot; The Japanese girl whispered.

&quot;Oh.. I see.. How about college..? Do you have any intention of 
attending college..?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot;

Actually, Kirika was offered by Mireille to attend high school. But the 
brunette had rejected it right after Mireille asked about it.

Time flew by, and Dr. Naomi and Kirika kept chatting for about an hour, 
until noon.

&quot; I am going to take a bath.&quot; Kirika said, as she stood up.

&quot;Mind if I join you..?&quot; asked Dr. Naomi abruptly as she smiled to 
Kirika.

Kirika was actually surprised to hear this, tough her facial expression 
didn&#39;t show so. She had only bathed with others with Chloe, and once 
with Mireille, while she was badly injured back then.

&quot;Not really.&quot;

Dr. Naomi and Kirika bathed together. They washed each other back, and 
played with water. Despite her age, Dr. Naomi looked like a child while 
she was playing with water. She splashed the water all over to Kirika. 
They chuckled and played in the water for about an hour without 
realizing it. Somehow Kirika was enjoying it.

After a long time bathing, they dressed up. Kirika wore her usual cloth, 
while Dr. Naomi wore a new shirt which was given from Kirika. Done with 
dressing up, Dr. Naomi offered to comb Kirika&#39;s hair. Kirika refused, 
because she felt no need for it. Her hair was short, after all.

&quot;Just let me do it.&quot; Dr. Naome smiled excitedly.

Dr. Naomi combed Kirika&#39;s hair slowly and carefully. It was tiring how 
she took her time to comb Kirika&#39;s hair. Surely enough it was long for 
Kirika. At the time they stepped out of the bathroom, Mireille hadn&#39;t 
woken up yet.

&quot;What about delivering some pizza..?&quot; Dr. Naomi offered Kirika.

&quot;Pizza..?&quot; the Japanese girl whispered softly.

&quot;I will treat both you and Mireille, to reply your kindness.&quot; the doctor 
said, while smiling cheerfully.

In the end, Dr. Naomi ordered some pizza for all of them. While waiting 
for the pizza, Kirika opened up the window and stared at the sky. 
Suddenly she heard the vet&#39;s soft voice, &quot;Actually I suppose to go home, 
don&#39;t you think so..?&quot;

Kirika glanced at Dr. Naomi, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot;

The female doctor smiled slightly, &quot;Thanks. I..&quot;

Just then a knock was heard on the front door. Kirika walked to open the 
door. It was a man with a box of pizza on his hand. Dr. Naomi searched 
for something in her skirt. Just after she found it, she opened it up. 
She gave some money from her wallet to the man. Kirika received the 
pizza from the man, and placed it on the table.

Kirika was about to make some tea. But she heard some strange noise was 
made. She turned her back, and saw that the female doctor was hold by 
the man who delivered the pizza. The noise was basically a failed scream 
from Dr. Naomi. The man used his handkerchief and placed it on Dr. 
Naomi&#39;s nose, which made the doctor become unconscious. When Kirika had 
pulled out her gun, the man had ran away and nowhere to be seen. From 
the sound of the running footsteps after, it was obvious that the man 
didn&#39;t work alone.

Kirika was careless. She didn&#39;t expect this to happen. As she lowered 
her gun, she saw a piece of paper was left by the kidnapper. She put it 
up then read it. After that, she ran to the bedroom, and tried to wake 
Mireille up.

&quot;Mireille..!&quot; Kirika exclaimed as loud as she can.

Mireille, who was still asleep, groaned and looked at the person who 
woke her up, &quot;Kiri..ka?&quot;

Once again, just in the same week, Mireille saw Kirika in little panic. 
It was the second time this week. The blonde tried to clear up her 
sleepy mind. The brunette didn&#39;t say anything to her though, so she 
asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;

Kirika seemed to have calm down a bit as she managed to control her 
voice&#39;s volume. &quot;Dr. Naomi was kidnapped. And the kidnapper left this.&quot; 
She showed the paper to Mireille.

Mireille was shocked to hear that. &quot;Kidnapped??!&quot;

On the center of the paper was written:

If you want this person back, bring fifty billion at 12 p.m tomorrow to 
the address below:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;It wasn&#39;t Soldats. I&#39;m sure about it.&quot; Mireille finally said, after 
read the letter. &quot;They aren&#39;t coward.&quot;

Kirika remained expressionless, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Is it too late to catch them now?&quot; asked the blonde.

&quot;I think so.&quot; Kirika whispered softly. &quot;Sorry.&quot; The brunette lowered her 
head.

Mireille smiled. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault, Kirika.&quot; She placed her hand on 
Kirika&#39;s cheek.

Surprised to receive the contact, Kirika looked up. She found Mireile 
was warmly smiling to her. The blonde then stood up, and walked out of 
the bedroom, while Kirika, whose cheeks turned pink, followed behind. 
The blonde walked to the pool table, and sat on it. Kirika closed the 
door, and once again proceeded to stare at the sky. They acted as if 
nothing happened. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t care about Dr. Naomi, but 
all they could do was stay and wait until the time which was decided 
came. They didn&#39;t have any choice besides. Both Kirika and Mireille knew 
this.

Mireille, whose mind had become rather clear, was now thinking about 
this incident.

As she was thinking the matter, she saw something on the floor. That 
thing was left not too far from the front door. It was a wallet. She 
jumped from the pool table, and walked to put it. Kirika didn&#39;t have a 
wallet, while Mireille&#39;s was in her jacket pocket. It was Dr. Naomi&#39;s, 
no doubt about it.

The wallet was made of leather, with the colour of black. It was a 
woman&#39;s wallet, for sure. Out of curiousity, Mireille opened the wallet. 
She saw credit cards, bills, cash money, and photos. The blonde was 
attracted to the photo. She pulled out all the photos in the wallet. One 
of the photos was a photo of three girls in their high school uniform. 
The other photos were also almost about of Dr. Naomi and her friends. 
When Mireille tried to put it all back to the wallet, she found out one 
more photos was hidden within the papers of bills, in the deepest part 
of the wallet.

It was a photo of a little girl. The girl was on her 3, or maybe more. 
That girl was wearing a blue long dress. The background of the photo was 
somewhere unknown to Mireille. The little girl smiled cheerfully. Her 
big eyes were somehow nostalgic for Mireille. The girl&#39;s hair was a 
curly brown one. This girl really seemed like familiar to her.

&quot;It&#39;s as if I had seen this girl...&quot;

Suddenly there was a tiny sound heard by. It was sound of footsteps. The 
footsteps weren&#39;t the usual footsteps they usually heard. Kirika ran 
towards the left side of the door, while holding her gun. Mireille hold 
her gun on one hand, while the other hand was holding Dr. Naomi&#39;s 
wallet. To their surprise, the door was opened without force. A person 
slowly walked in. The person was a woman with the pair of friendly brown 
eyes. The face was already known for both Mireille and Kirika.

&quot;Doctor Naomi?!&quot; Mireille almost exclaimed when she said this.

Dr. Naomi smiled mysteriously, &quot;Hey, Mireille, Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you knock..?&quot; Mireille lowered her gun and sighed. &quot;I have 
almost shot the gun.&quot;

The oldest woman looked like she felt guilty. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. It was 
quiet here. So I thought no one was here, and come in to check. Sorry.&quot; 
she apologized.

Kirika asked, &quot;What about the kidnappers?&quot;

Dr. Naomi smiled to this question. She raised her eyebrows and said with 
a childish tone, &quot;You wanna know..?&quot;

Dr. Naomi told them that she had a little knowledge of martial arts, so 
when she had woken up, which fortunately was early, she somehow stroke 
down the kidnappers.

&quot;It was just two of them. So it wasn&#39;t difficult.&quot; The female doctor 
explained.

Dr. Naomi also explained how she beat them up. She said that in the car 
she was placed in, there were a lot of things which easily can be used. 
But amongst all those, she chose the rubbish bin.

Mireille laughed after heard the story, &quot;Lucky you.&quot;

&quot;Then, what happened?&quot; asked Kirika, who had finished chuckled.

Dr. Naomi grinned naughtily and continued her story, &quot;Then..&quot;

Time flew by while none of them realized about it. They did the funny 
chit-chat until dusk.

&quot;Ah. It is already this late. I&#39;d better go home.&quot; said Dr. Naomi, as 
she finished told the story.

Mireille suddenly remembered the wallet she found. &quot;This is yours, Dr. 
Naomi.&quot; She gave it to Dr. Naomi.

&quot;Oh.. Thank you very much!&quot; The female vet received it gratefully, as 
she stood up and walked to the door.

Dr. Naomi wasn&#39;t an expected guest, so no other belongings were brought. 
And Dr. Naomi could go home while carried nothing but her wallet.

Mireille and Kirika stood up too, as they would bid farewell to their 
friend. The female doctor refused Kirika and Mireille&#39;s offered to 
accompany her home. So it turned out that Dr. Naomi went home alone.

&quot;Thanks for everything, Kirika, Mireille..!&quot; Dr. Naomi said as she bowed 
to them, then left.

Mireille closed the door after bid the farewell, while Kirika walked to 
the tea table. Mireille also sat there, to drink her tea.

As the blonde drank the tea, her mind was focused on something else. 
Something is bothering my mind...

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Kirika.

Mireille sipped her tea. &quot;Mm.. Nothing.&quot;

The brunette poured the tea from its cup to her empty cup. &quot;Hey, 
Mireille.&quot; Kirika smiled slightly and said, &quot;I like Dr. Naomi. She was 
kind and funny.&quot;

The blonde placed her cup on the table. &quot;Yeah.. Wonder why Chloe wanted 
to kill her.&quot;

&quot;Yes..&quot; Kirika whispered softly.

&quot;She supposed to sleep here tonight..&quot; Mireille smiled, &quot; So you too 
will sleep in the sofa..!&quot; the blonde laughed cheerfully.

Kirika said nothing in return but laughed too. Mireille unconsciously 
gazed at Kirika&#39;s laughing face. She didn&#39;t realize that Kirika had 
stopped laughing. Kirika smiled to the blonde. &quot;Feel sleepy again..?&quot;

Mireille woke up from her gazed. &quot;Eh.. No.&quot;

&quot;I will take a bath first then.&quot; The brunette said as she walked to the 
bathroom.

Mireille watched as Kirika closed the bathroom&#39;s door. She reminded 
herself about the photo she found in Dr. Naomi&#39;s wallet. No wonder she 
felt familiar to the photo. The girl in the last photo resembled someone 
she knew.

Kirika..? </pre>
