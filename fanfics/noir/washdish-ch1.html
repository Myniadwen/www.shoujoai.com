<h1>Washing the Dishes (part 1 of 13)</h1>

<pre>&quot;The new table looks nice.&quot; I say, settling myself in with a sigh. It&#39;s 
so good to be home, after two weeks in the hotel, and the week before 
that in Spain recovering from our wounds. Being on painkillers, the time 
flew by quickly, but in other ways it seems I&#39;ve been gone from here 
forever.

&quot;It&#39;s a lot sturdier than the last one. We don&#39;t have to eat on the pool 
table anymore.&quot; Mireille states proudly. She&#39;s been here every day for 
the last two weeks, getting the place cleaned up, refurnishing. We have 
a new sofa, a new pool table, new plants and bookshelves. It all looks 
good. I wanted to come with her but she was firm in her command that I 
rest.

&quot;After all, I need you in top form to make our first tea there.&quot; she&#39;d 
quipped, looking at me sternly, but her eyes were smiling. So I spent my 
days healing, drawing, and weaning off the pills. I looked forward to 
her nightly reports on the apartment progress. I never heard her talk so 
much before, and it was something I looked forward to every day.

----------

Now here we sit, our first tea together back at home. It&#39;s been a long 
day, getting settled back in, and I&#39;m tired. We sip our tea in grateful 
silence. I wonder if she will become more quiet now that we&#39;re back 
home- I hope not. These last few weeks I&#39;ve felt closer to her than ever 
before. She drains the last of her tea, pushes back her chair and gets 
up from the table.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to change&quot; she tosses back over her shoulder &quot;and then come 
do the dishes.&quot;

&quot;I should do that.&quot; I fight a yawn as I speak. I hate getting tired so 
easily. &quot;You made lunch and dinner.&quot;

&quot;And I made a mess...&quot; she turns, putting her hands on her hips with 
great authority. &quot;...which I am going to clean up, while you get ready 
for bed.&quot;

I sigh, because I am too tired to argue the point. I gather up the 
teacups and place them in the sink with the other dishes. At least our 
teacups survived. I would have hated to get new ones.

I start to leave the kitchen when she appears in her favorite 
nightshirt, the oversized one with the rolled up sleeves. She brushes 
past me and I lean against the door, watching her. I realize how much 
I&#39;ve missed the sight of her, just as she is now, busily filling the 
sink with suds. A few weeks ago, at the Manor, I never would have 
thought this was possible. But here I am. Suddenly I feel tears in my 
eyes, and find myself stumbling towards her. My arms go around her 
waist, and my tears sink into her back.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; she tenses, alarmed.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; I choke out.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Do you need a doctor?&quot; her voice is concerned, and she 
goes to turn off the water. I free a hand and stop her.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; I beg her. &quot;Just stay like this. Please.&quot; I mouth the words 
into her shirt, but she understands me. After a moment, she turns the 
water back on, and my hand returns to her belly. She feels so warm and 
good.

&quot;I&#39;m happy. So happy to be home.&quot; I breathe into her.

&quot;Hmph.&quot; comes a non-committal grunt as she begins to scrub the dishes.

She works silently, and I become aware of her muscles moving as she 
reaches to put each dish in the drainer, and relish each movement. It&#39;s 
all new, this feel of her body moving against mine. I sigh and hold her 
more tightly.

&quot;So this makes you happy, hmmm?&quot; she asks, putting the last dish in the 
drainer.

&quot;Yes.&quot; I answer, wishing we had more dishes.

&quot;Well I hate to make you unhappy, but I need to dry these and put them 
away. Go on to bed, okay?&quot; she says, not bothering to look at me. She 
gives my hands a quick squeeze that makes my heart jump funny. I try to 
squeeze back but she puts my hands down.

&quot;Let go, Kirika.&quot; she says softly.

&quot;Mireille-&quot;

&quot;Go to bed.&quot; she says firmly this time, and I leave, knowing she means 
it.</pre>
