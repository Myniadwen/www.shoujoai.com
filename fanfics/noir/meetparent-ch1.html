<h1>Meet the Parent (part 1 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cozmos.html">Cozmos</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a sunny day. No signs of raining, storm, or any other thing from 
the sky that would make this pleasant peaceful bright day disturbed. 
People did their activities as usual.

A rare peaceful day they had, Mireille and Kirika were in their small, 
comfortable apartment, doing their daily activities by their own. 
Although the apartment was a bit tiny, it seemed that it was enough for 
the two of them as they barely used all spaces.

The Japanese girl was as usual, staring out from the window, gazing to 
the sky. The older one of them was sitting comfortably as her eyes 
staring seriously at the laptop screen, once again checking her e-mail. 
A job e-mail.

&quot;Seems that there is no job for us today,&quot; Mireille said, still paying 
attention of her laptop screen.

Kirika just nodded in silence, not even whisper a word. She was fully 
busy staring at the sky, until a black bird stole her attention. She 
gazed at the bird, no purpose at all. That black bird landed at a tree 
that is not far away from their apartment. Oh well, birds did have their 
own activities. A few second passed and Kirika finally came to realize 
that a bird nest was resting safely at the top of the tree. Two little 
birds, different colours from each other, happily let out their cute 
small noises from their lips, after seeing their father came back.

The father bird brought some worms to the nest. Just as the worms were 
put at the nest, two hungry little birds hastily ate them. Despite how 
normal the condition should be, an unexpected event occurred as the 
oldest bird suddenly fell over from the tree.

No rough sound was made, but Kirika knew that the bird had fallen from 
the tree. Mireille, who unaware of this event, just stay still in front 
of her laptop, sending some email to her friend.

The Japanese girl turned around then walked to the door without looking 
at Mireille, &quot;I&#39;m going for a couple minutes.&quot; Then she went away.

Outside the apartment, Kirika easily found the trees where the black 
bird got a nest. Not too long after that, she found the injured bird and 
spontaneously put the black bird in her palm. Quickly, she ran back to 
the apartment. One step inside the apartment, the Japanese girl found 
Mireille was not checking her mail anymore. The sound of water splashed 
answered the brunette&#39;s questioning mind. Her partner was practically 
taking a bath.

&#145;Where do Mireille always put the first-aid kit..?&#39; Kirika wandered 
around the house, still with the injured black in her hands in order to 
try to remember the last time she had seen the medicine kit. Panic 
filled her head, she unconsciously walked in a circle order.

It was a bit absurd that an expressionless girl who could easily kill 
people (whether barehanded or not), will care for animals small injury. 
But, reality is the fact. Kirika seemed extremely worried about the 
bird&#39;s wound. At first glance though, the bird looked like he was only 
broke one of his black wing ridiculously.

Few minutes later, Mireille stepped out of the bathroom. She has changed 
her clothes as she now wearing a blue tank top with a mini leather 
skirt. She saw Kirika, then smiled.

&quot; It was really just a couple minutes, eh..?&quot;

Still wandering aimlessly, Kirika didn&#39;t answer. Usually she will nod or 
did anything else, unless made a bit reaction toward Mireille&#39;s 
question. But now, her eyes showed some worry. Mireille felt confused at 
her partner&#39;s unusual behaviour.

&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked, still unaware of what the brunette was 
carrying in her palm.

It was when Kirika stopped circling around that the blonde saw a black 
bird in Kirika&#39;s hand. Everything became clear. Mireille had completely 
understood about Kirika&#39;s affection toward animals. And there were no 
other option left when the short brown hair had come to show up some 
animals to her. Took care for it, or cure it. And judging from the 
current situation, Mireille knew that the second option was the right 
one. She had seen the bird&#39;s wound, as its wing was somehow did not look 
like in proper condition.

&quot;Oh my... Let&#39;s go to the vet, then.., Kirika.&quot; Mireille said.

Ten minutes walked in a hurry, Mireille and Kirika finally found a vet 
clinic, not too far from their apartment. The clinic was a small, tiny 
cottage which painted all over in yellow and red. Some Chinese symbols 
were also painted at the wall. It showed some oriental taste from the 
owner. When the two of them stepped in, they found a small room with 
Chinese style, a low ceiling, and a small altar. There was no one there, 
just the two of them. They wait, sitting on a comfortable little coach 
in the room. All stuff in the room seemed to be brand new. It was hardly 
surprising, as there were lots of people recently came to live in this 
area. This vet was surely one of them.

Suddenly, a lady dressed with white showed up from the back of her 
little desk at the end of the room. Both Mireille and Kirika stood up. 
The vet&#39;s mouth was covered with a mask, and her hair with a hat. All 
she wearing was coloured in white. By first glance, the lady is nearly 
in her thirty from the enigmatic look and her mature face which barely 
shown. She was obviously a Chinese, based on her curly long black hair, 
though at the same time she looked like a Spanish. This was just based 
on Mireille&#39;s feeling, though.

&quot; Can I help you, young ladies..?&quot; the female vet smiled at them.

Mireille replied her smile, then said, &quot;We need your help to examine 
this bird.&quot;

Kirika stepped forward and closer to the vet, as she handed over the 
bird to the vet. The woman received it deliberately. Carefully, the 
doctor brought the black bird to a small white table.

After a few minutes waiting in silence, Mireille asked &quot;Sorry, Dr. ...?&quot;

&quot;Just call me Dr. Naomi.&quot; answered the doctor, still busy examining the 
bird.

Did not have such urge to disturb the vet&#39;s concentration, Mireille just 
decided to wait patiently.

Dr. Naomi obviously took her time examining the bird. Mireille and 
Kirika, both helpless, were silently waiting.

Half an hour later, Mireille chose to speak up as she felt full enough 
of waiting. &quot; Well then, Dr. Naomi... &quot;

&quot; How&#39;s her..? &quot; Kirika asked abruptly, cutting Mireille&#39;s line.

Kirika obviously was in panic as her tone was almost audible for anyone 
near her, although most of the physical look of her didn&#39;t change.

&quot;It&#39;s over now, ladies.&quot; Dr. Naomi said facing her customer, smiling.

She then gently removed her mask, so now both Mireille and Kirika could 
see her face a little more.

Dr. Naomi had a pair of crisp brown eyes, that consider quite big for a 
Chinese, or rather Spanish. Yet, Mireille could not judge which one is 
it. The blonde did not know why, but she felt not like meeting a 
stranger at all. The female vet was pretty friendly, that was why. Felt 
a little confused, Mireille remain silent. Pretty friendly, isn&#39;t she..?

&quot;What do you mean..?&quot; Kirika asked, still in panic.

&quot;Well.. She is fine by now, if you ask me.&quot; Dr Naomi said, still 
smiling. She put the unconscious black bird in her palm. Then she 
stepped back, and handed over the bird back to Kirika, who gratefully 
received it.

Awake from her thought, Mireille said, &quot;Thank you very much, Dr. Naomi. 
How much do we have to pay, then..?&quot;

&quot;Ah.., never mind. It is a relief that both of you are satisfied with my 
work.&quot; Dr. Naomi replied.

&quot;Well.. It would be nice if we could pay you for what you&#39;ve done, to 
act out our gratitude towards you, Dr. Naomi.&quot; Mireille insisted to pay.

Dr. Naomi smiled, &quot;No.. No.. It&#39;s really nothing to bother..&quot;

In the end, Mireille and Kirika paid nothing but chat with the doctor. 
Mireille simply wanted to go home after finishing her business with the 
vet, but she knew that her small asian friend beside her did not want to 
go home yet. From the twinkling happy eyes, the blonde could simply 
assume that the Japanese girl was curious to learn more about animals 
with the vet.

They chat until dusk. No need to recall what they were talking about for 
it was just some friendly chat, based on Kirika&#39;s curiosity of animals. 
Simply had a long chit-chat, both Mireille and Kirika finally knew that 
Dr. Naomi had just opened her clinic since last month. She lived in 
America before moved here in order to meet her relatives and 
coincidentally somehow, worked as a vet.

Out of politeness, Mireille and Kirika told a bit of their self, pretty 
careful not to mention the assassin part. As the sky was getting dark, 
they two of them excused their self and walked home after a shrt 
farewell.

&quot;Phew..&quot; the blonde sighed on their way home. &quot;Finally finished.&quot;

Kirika like always, said nothing as her hand cupping the black bird 
tight.

Neither Mireille nor Kirika try to open up a conversation, so they 
remained silent until they reach the apartment.

Mireille unlocked the door, then stepped in.

&quot;Do you want to take a bath first..?&quot; she asked Kirika.

Kirika seemed to hesitate at first, but nodded in return. &quot;Yes.&quot; She 
said.

&quot;Let me take care of him, then.&quot; the blonde said, pointing at the black 
bird wrapped in Kirika&#39;s small hand.

After made sure that Mireille could handle the bird while she was taking 
a bath, she gave the bird to the blonde. Silently, the Japanese girl 
walked to the bathroom.

Mireille gently put the bird in bed as there was no other place she 
thought was appropriate. Living in apartment, they simply did not have 
such thing as a cage. After made sure that the bird would not fly or 
walk or did anything risky, the blonde turned on her computer. She 
checked her mail, but got nothing new as the result. Just when her mind 
started to think whether she should take a bath once more or not, Kirika 
stepped out of the bathroom, revealed her white skin that barely wrapped 
with towel.

She smiled, then whispered softly, &quot;Your turn now, Mireille.&quot;

Awake from her sleepy thought, the blonde stood up. &quot;Yeah..&quot;
