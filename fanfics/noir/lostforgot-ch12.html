<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Her post at the window abandoned, Kirika found herself once again 
wandering aimlessly through the empty halls of the ancient Manor. She 
passed from room to room slowly, hoping that the unfamiliar surroundings 
would become familiar; hoping a memory might make it&#39;s way back to her.

Her efforts seemed vain as she moved throughout the house, through 
long-forgotten dens and never-used guest rooms. The halls yielded no 
information, nor did the studies or lounges. Her hope depleted, she 
found herself in a small library far from the areas of the Manor which 
were commonly used; far from Mireille or Chloe or Althena. Sighing she 
pulled a sheet off of an old sofa in the corner, sitting down and 
stirring a cloud of dust from the ancient upholstery. She&#39;d tried her 
hardest but she couldn&#39;t remember a thing. Then again, how could one 
really will themselves to remember anything? Frustrated, she bent over, 
holding her head in her hands and sighing heavily.

Kirika lifted her head up, sensing she was no longer alone. Chloe was 
standing in the doorway, looking in tentatively. Kirika smiled, sitting 
back on her bed, resting on her elbows, &quot;Come in, it&#39;s your room too.&quot;

Chloe smiled and entered, sure now she&#39;d not interrupted her friend, 
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s eyes opened slowly, a small bit of her memory finding its way 
back to her. It wasn&#39;t a lost cause after all. She stood up, fairly 
certain she&#39;d learned all she could from this place. It looked like this 
room hadn&#39;t been used in decades; she&#39;d probably not been here before. 
Where in the house had she been before? Well, Chloe&#39;s room for certain, 
and the dining room and entry way, but those were all quite mundane. 
Hoping the familiar surroundings would bring more of her past back to 
her she began a slow trek back to the area of the Manor she would have 
actually spent time.

She reached the front entrance without any revelations, and thankfully 
without any interruptions from other occupants of the house. Her mind 
set on the stone arena beyond the hill at which she used to train with 
Chloe she left the manor, squinting her eyes against the sunlight.

It was a short walk, no more than a half kilometer, to the arena Kirika 
could now recall from her days here. It looked no different than what 
she could remember. A rather abused-looking training dummy stood in the 
center, no doubt fresh from a Chloe beating. She sat down on one of the 
huge stone steps, taking in the site of the old training ground.

The clash of steel and the heavy breathing of the two girls was all that 
could be heard within the arena as the adolescents engaged in what would 
appear to the uneducated as a vicious battle to the death. Each strike 
was intended to hit home, each thrust driven with the seeming intent to 
kill.

The pair dodged and parried, darted and lunged as they danced around the 
arena guiding their swords as efficiently as possible towards the metal 
plate that covered the breast of their foe. It seemed an eternity as 
they traded missed and parried blows before Kirika was able to knock the 
sword from the other&#39;s hand, sending it skidding through the dust to the 
other side of the arena. Letting out a grunt in dismay Chloe sprinted 
after the sword, reaching it just as Kirika pounced on her back, 
tackling the younger girl under her. She pressed the flat of her blade 
firmly across Chloe&#39;s neck to prove her point, &quot;You lose.&quot;

Relaxing and letting her forehead rest in the dust Chloe let out a 
slight moan of displeasure, &quot;I thought I could get it in time . . .&quot;

Kirika pushed herself up off of the girl, brushing off her clothes and 
trying to brush dust out of the nicks and cuts that Chloe&#39;d been able to 
inflict. As Chloe rolled over onto her stomach Kirika held out her hand 
to help the girl up, &quot;Come on, we should go back and get these cuts 
cleaned up,&quot; she said, bringing her attention to the numerous small 
gashes she&#39;d been able to inflict in retaliation.

Chloe sighed, picking up her sword, &quot;I guess I wasn&#39;t fast enough.&quot;

&quot;You did fine,&quot; Kirika smiled, bringing a smile to her partner&#39;s face as 
well, &quot;Fine just wasn&#39;t good enough,&quot; she finished jeeringly as she 
started walking back to the house.

&quot;I&#39;ll get you next time,&quot; Chloe claimed as she caught up with her 
partner, falling into step beside her.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Kirika protested as she rested her sword on her 
shoulder.

The young Japanese girl crossed her legs as she sat on the stone steps 
of the mini-coliseum, looking up at the blue, cloudless sky. She had 
indeed trained alongside Chloe here. They&#39;d fought some vicious battles 
no doubt, yet we always left together, as friends.

They&#39;re coming back to me. It&#39;s all coming back. I suppose it will only 
take time, Kirika surmised, standing. It seems that being around things 
from my past helps . . . Chloe . . .

Kirika&#39;d not had to search long before finding Chloe. Covered in dirt 
and sweat from her sparring with the wooden mannequin earlier that 
morning Chloe had sought out the cavernous bathing hall The girl had 
looked up and smiled at Kirika for a moment, a slight pink showing on 
her cheeks before turning back to scrub the dirt from her nails 
vigorously.

Kirika sat on a natural outcropping of rock on the wall, quite suited as 
bench and hugged her knees to her chest, What do I say to her, though? 
She was my friend but now I can&#39;t even talk to her about us.

Kirika&#39;s internal quandary was resolved when Chloe opted to speak first, 
&quot;Althena has almost figured out who ordered the attacks on Noir,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;It should be only a day or so until we&#39;ll know for certain.&quot;

Kirika nodded, &quot;And then we&#39;ll go after whoever it is.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and then this will be over,&quot; Chloe&#39;s voice was sullen.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;When this is over . . . you&#39;re going back to Paris with your friend,&quot; 
Chloe dumped a bucket of water over her head to wash away the soap suds.

A melancholy look played itself across Kirika&#39;s features. Of course 
she&#39;d known that she&#39;d be returning to Paris with Mireille. It was her . 
. . home. But this is too sudden. Two days? I&#39;m beginning to remember 
things . . . and that will stop if I leave here. But I can&#39;t stay. I 
have to go with Mireille. She buried her face in her knees in 
frustration, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to go with Mireille; I want to 
be friends with her . . . but I can&#39;t just abandon this place, these 
people . . . Chloe . . .

Rather than stumble through any further awkward conversation with Chloe 
Kirika rose from her bench, taking her leave of the cavernous bath.</pre>
