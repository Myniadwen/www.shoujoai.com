<a href="../noir/eclipse-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It&#39;s a dark blur but I know I&#39;m in some sort of vehicle that is moving 
and there&#39;s a mask over my face, pumping oxygen into me. My head is 
turned to the side and strapped down. I can feel the drool still oozing 
from my mouth. It&#39;s run into my hair and I feel sticky.

&quot;That was too close.&quot; The woman writes busily onto a clipboard. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know she was this small.&quot;

We turn a corner sharply and she falls over top me, her long ponytail 
tickling my nose. I can&#39;t move to brush it away- my body feels totally 
limp.

&quot;Are you trying to kill all of us?&quot; she yells out to the driver. We hit 
some sort of a bump and she curses under her breath. I feel the blood 
pressure cuff squeezing my arm.

We come to a sudden halt and I hear the doors open. Light streams in, 
blinding me. I close my eyes and I feel the board I&#39;m strapped on being 
lifted up and carried. A sudden cool whoosh of air comes over me, and I 
know we&#39;re inside. Things are still blurry, but there seem to be several 
people in lab coats gathering about me.

&quot;Tiny thing, isn&#39;t she?&quot; the voices float in, as if from a dream. Hands 
are on me now, and some sort of tube goes into my mouth, making a loud 
noise.

&quot;Suction set up.&quot;

&quot;BP eighty-six over fifty and holding. Respirations at fourteen.&quot;

&quot;Give her a few.&quot; A tall man with glasses leans over me. &quot;Then we&#39;ll 
start.&quot;

I want desperately to move, to say something, but my body refuses to 
respond. I hear them talking in low tones, and I know it is about me. 
What do they want with me?

&quot;BP now ninety-four over fifty-six.&quot; A voice calls out. It sounds like 
the man named Lambert, but with my head turned sideways like this, I 
can&#39;t really see anything. And the roaring sound from the suction tube 
in my mouth makes it hard to hear.

&quot;Now then.&quot; The tall man with the glasses leans over me. &quot;Let&#39;s do what 
we need and make sure she&#39;s stabilized.&quot; He takes the tube from my 
mouth, holds it for a moment, and puts it back as the drool starts up 
again. &quot;And don&#39;t forget the type and cross.&quot;

&quot;Got it doc.&quot; Lambert&#39;s voice is behind me. The blood pressure cuff is 
removed, and a tourniquet goes around my arm. Another needle goes into 
me and stays there.

The tall man flashes a penlight across my eyes. &quot;Neuro check is shit, 
since you almost killed her.&quot;

&quot;I told you, I didn&#39;t know she was this small!&quot; the woman from the park 
sounds angry. I feel the tourniquet snapped free from my arm, and my 
blood being drawn. A tape measure is placed at the top of my head and 
rolled downward.

&quot;We&#39;ll need pictures.&quot; The woman is now standing in front of me. &quot;Think 
we can sit her up?&quot;

I feel the needle taken from my arm, and a band-aid applied. The suction 
is taken from my mouth. Straps are being undone, but I&#39;m unable to move, 
even with my new freedom.

&quot;Lambert, help me hold her, she&#39;s dead weight.&quot; The woman groans. &quot;I 
just want her sitting up for the shots.&quot;

I feel myself being pulled upwards; the lights in the ceiling begin to 
spin, and I pass out.</pre>
