<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;And I thought Chloe was trouble,&quot; Mireille mused, sitting on her bed 
and sighing. She and Kirika had retreated to the Corsican&#39;s room where 
the younger girl had taken a position staring out the window at the 
grapes vines stretching into the distance, &quot;That woman, Althena, she&#39;s 
got &#39;suspicious&#39; written all over her. I just wish I knew what on Earth 
was going on. This woman obviously has connections with the Soldats. She 
probably works for them. But what&#39;s her motive? Why not just kill us? 
There&#39;s something especially twisted going on here.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Kirika sighed, not really paying attention.

&quot;K-Kirika, this is a problem! Why aren&#39;t you listening?&quot; Mireille 
demanded.

&quot;Oh, I-I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kirika turned to face Mireille, her expression blank.

&quot;That&#39;s it. Something&#39;s got you acting even odder than usual and you&#39;re 
going to tell me what it is,&quot; Mireille said firmly, sitting at a nearby 
table and beginning to drum her fingers.

&quot;Uh . . . I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kirika said quietly, turning back to the 
window, &quot;Since I lost my memory I&#39;ve always felt out of place, like I 
didn&#39;t belong, but since we&#39;ve come here, I feel a little more . . . I 
don&#39;t know, at home, I guess. Like this is where I should be.&quot;

&quot;Here!?&quot; Mireille&#39;s eye twitched with annoyance, &quot;You feel &#39;at home&#39; 
HERE, of all places? This god-forsaken primitive heap of rubble and two 
women who should be COMMITTED make you feel at home!?&quot;

Kirika stood up, a tear in her eye as she stared at the floor and began 
to march for the door, &quot;I don&#39;t expect you to understand,&quot; she said 
quietly, firmly, &quot;Which is why I didn&#39;t tell you.&quot; With that she closed 
the door behind her and began walking slowly down a hall, not knowing 
where exactly she was going. --- &#39;Why is Kirika acting like this?&#39; 
Mireille demanded to know, as if from deep within her mind she would 
find some sort of an answer. The girl had stormed out; well, not really 
stormed, but the strong and rare emotions emanating from the girl had 
struck Mireille at her soul. She had been gone a good 10 minutes before 
Mireille became aware that the girl had indeed left. &#39;Why does she care 
so much about this place? Why do this place and those freaks make her 
feel more at home than my apartment or I, ever did?&#39;

&quot;WHY DOES THAT BOTHER ME?!&quot; Mireille shouted to her room, dying to know 
the answer; dying to know that the answer was not what she thought.

&#39;Because she means that much to me,&#39; Mireille admitted submissively, 
&#39;Because I love her. I guess I knew already . . . I found her perplexing 
and intriguing when we first met, and as we persevered through so much, 
as I watched her, I became attached. I guess . . . I guess I just never 
wanted to admit it. I&#39;ve never liked a girl before . . . but I&#39;ve never 
met a girl like her before.&#39;

Mireille rose from her seat, shaking a bit with her first few steps, and 
left her room, knocking on Kirika&#39;s door. There was no answer. When 
Mireille opened the door and found it empty she grabbed her gun and went 
to find, and if need be, rescue, her friend . . . her love. --- Kirika 
walked down the dark hall, her only light being cast by the moon falling 
through occasional slats in the wall, throwing a ghostly silver light on 
stone and old portraits of prominent looking people. She had been 
walking for nearly an hour, slowly meandering through the halls, but 
never finding a dead end or closed door. &#39;It&#39;s like I know this place,&#39; 
she thought to herself, and stifled an unwanted sob, &#39;but why? I want to 
know why!&#39;

Kirika looked up. At long last she had come to a closed door. This door 
. . . she knew this door. It was hazy, but she knew this, remembered it. 
The large oak door had appeared once before in her dreams since she had 
been living with the Daughter of Corsica, but she knew . . . she felt 
she knew it from a time before that. With no hesitation the young woman 
reached for the doorknob and twisted it slowly, pushing the door open.

&quot;Kirika, can I help you with something?&quot; Althena smiled up at the girl. 
The room was small; there was a desk at which the older woman sat, 
writing with a quill pen by candlelight. It was both serene and surreal 
to Kirika, who just stood silently. After a moment Althena set her quill 
down, &quot;You can come in if you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Kirika stepped in, shaking her head, and closed the door 
behind her. Althena sat smiling at her for a moment, &quot;I-uh . . . was 
just wandering. I . . . I&#39;m sorry if I interrupted you.&quot;

&quot;Not at all, I was just finishing,&quot; Althena smiled softly, as she folded 
the letter and began dripping red wax onto it for the seal, &quot;This letter 
is very important, so Chloe will be leaving in the morning to deliver it 
for me. I hope that your room is satisfactory.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, it&#39;s very nice.&quot; Kirika nodded, sitting on one of two stools 
near the desk.

&quot;Hmm . . .&quot; Althena pressed a seal into the wax and stood up. &quot;I should 
go give this to Chloe, would you like to walk with me?&quot;

Kirika nodded and after blowing out the candle the two women left and 
began trekking the corridors side-by-side.

&quot;A-Althena?&quot; Kirika ventured quietly after a few moments of walking 
silently beside the older woman. When the woman nodded that she was 
listening she continued, &quot;I, I feel like I&#39;ve . . . like I&#39;ve been here 
before. But I don&#39;t remember anything. Did you . . . I mean, do you . . 
. do you know me?&quot;

The older woman turned to look at the questioning girl and smiled, 
giving a slight nod, &quot;When I was very young I learned of the story of 
Noir. I saw the . . . potential in the legend and strived to become a 
part of it, not as an actual member, as much as a facilitator. Sixteen 
years ago, after I had come to live here, a man brought me two children, 
blessed by a high priest, who had the potential to become Noir. Both, 
apparently, were orphaned. I named one of them Kirika, for her Japanese 
heritage. The other I named Chloe,&quot; Althena sighed and smiled once again 
at the intently listening Kirika, &quot;You could not have been more than 3 
when you arrived here, Chloe couldn&#39;t have been over a year, still in 
infancy. I had no idea how to raise assassins. I tried my best, and that 
seems to have been sufficient, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; She chuckled a bit, 
&quot;You and Chloe were the perfect team, an elite force, always in sync 
with each other, as if you were closer than any two humans could be. 
Which you seemed to be. You grew up together, and became a part of each 
other, in a sense. When you left the Manor for a mission and you never 
returned . . . Chloe was bedridden for a year. She was so stricken with 
depression that at a point it appeared that she would die. But then . . 
. then word came that a girl named Kirika Yuumura had surfaced in 
Japan,&quot; Althena&#39;s voice lifted from its remorseful tone, &quot;Chloe was 
ecstatic. After a quick recovery she immediately left for Japan, only to 
return with news that you no long remembered anything. She vowed that 
she would seek vengeance on whoever did this to you, and one day help 
you to regain your memories . . . it&#39;s been very hard for her.&quot;

After several moments of silence Kirika turned away from Althena, &quot;I, 
I&#39;m sorry to have put her through such pain. I - I still don&#39;t 
remember,&quot; She stifled a sob.

Althena wrapped her arm around Kirika as they walked in silence, &quot;But 
now, now you know. And you can begin rebuilding your life.&quot;</pre>
