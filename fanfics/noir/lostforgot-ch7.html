<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Huh? Oh . . .&quot; Chloe half-leapt out of her bed, startled from her 
oh-so-wonderful dream by a knocking on her door, Damn, and it was just 
getting good, she smiled to herself, hoping she didn&#39;t look to flushed 
as she cracked the door open, seeing the focus of her dream causing her 
blush to deepen, &quot;Kirika. I-uh-what is it?&quot;

&quot;Can I come in?&quot; She asked humbly, &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t interrupt anything . 
. .&quot;

Eh, I must be so red . . . not to mention I think I&#39;m sweating, Chloe 
grimaced, shaking her head, &quot;No, nothing, I was just sleeping. Please, 
uh, come in,&quot; she stepped aside, allowing the other girl entrance before 
closing the oaken door behind her &quot;Was there something wrong?&quot;

Kirika remained silent, scanning Chloe&#39;s room slowly. This seemed very 
familiar to her. The contents were simple enough; a large four-poster 
bed, an armoire, a fainting couch . . .

&quot;When will you be back?&quot; Chloe inquired, sitting on the couch as she 
watched her friend donning her traveling clothes. Her head held in her 
hands she watched Kirika&#39;s every move as the assassin gracefully 
prepared for another task.

&quot;Soon,&quot; Kirika replied plainly as she grabbed a long green cloak from 
the armoire and draped it around her shoulders. Checking her gun she 
smiled at the younger girl, &quot;As soon as I can.&quot;

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Chloe inquired, a bit of worry showing in her voice, &quot;Is 
everything alright?&quot;

&quot;I-uh, yes,&quot; Kirika nodded, What was that? Some sort of . . . memory? No 
matter . . ., &quot;Chloe, I . . . I wanted to apologize.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Chloe sat on her bed, staring inquisitively at the elder 
assassin.

&quot;Because, I don&#39;t remember. I know I know you, but I don&#39;t know how. I 
know we were friends, but I don&#39;t know how we met, what we did together, 
why we stopped being friends. I . . . don&#39;t remember anything,&quot; Kirika 
sighed, sitting down next to Chloe.

Chloe sat silently for several minutes, and then grinned slightly, &quot;I 
would like to tell you. I would like you to know about us . . . but an 
answer is something you must find for yourself. That&#39;s what Althena 
always told us. If someone were to tell you something it&#39;s not memory, 
it&#39;s just a fact you were told. You will regain your memory one day, and 
then you will understand that it&#39;s not something I can just tell you.&quot;

Kirika held her face in her hands, &quot;But . . . what if I never get my 
memory back?&quot;

&quot;You will, Kirika,&quot; Chloe said resolutely, somehow lending her faith to 
Kirika and lifting the older girl&#39;s spirits, &quot;And until then,&quot; Chloe 
smiled happily, &quot;We will be friends again.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we will.&quot; Kirika smiled.

&quot;Kirika, there you are!&quot; Mireille gave a sigh of relief, jogging up to 
Kirika as she shut the door of Chloe&#39;s room, &quot;What were you doing in 
there?&quot; Mireille inquired, suspicion and jealousy rearing its ugly head.

&quot;Talking,&quot; she responded quietly, starting down the corridor towards the 
front door.

&quot;About what?&quot; Mireille pressed, following her partner.

&quot;About my memory.&quot;

&quot;Or lack thereof,&quot; Mireille chuckled to herself, then continued, 
&quot;Listen. This Althena lady has got to have something to do with the 
Soldats. She practically came right out and told me. Apparently there&#39;s 
a group in the Soldats trying to kill Noir but others are trying to stop 
them. Anyways, Althena has to have something to do with it. This place 
is dangerous, but it&#39;s going to lead us to some answers, I think.&quot; 
Mireille paused, waiting for a reply, but as the Japanese girl continued 
walking silently she continued, &quot;But, anyways, just be on your toes, I 
don&#39;t trust these women.&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; the girl responded calmly.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I said I trust them,&quot; Kirika smiled a bit, &quot;I . . . I used to know 
them, before I lost my memory. I&#39;m not sure how, but I know that they&#39;re 
not going to hurt me. I think I&#39;ll go lie down now. Excuse me, 
Mireille,&quot; with that the girl retreated into her room, ending the 
conversation, leaving a perplexed and slightly angry Corsican standing 
in her wake.

What? She&#39;s had connections with these people all along and she didn&#39;t 
even tell me? Mireille thought frantically, She&#39;s been keeping this from 
me the whole time? No, that can&#39;t be it. There&#39;s got to be something 
else. I&#39;m her best friend, dammit! Of course she&#39;d tell me first. They 
must have done something to her. Mind control? Ha! This house must be 
driving me insane. Wonder how long I can stay here until I&#39;m as crazy as 
Althena. I bet this place is getting to Kirika, too. Maybe if we get 
away for a while this will all clear up. After all, it can&#39;t be too 
dangerous to leave if that freak sends Chloe out on &#145;missions.&#39; I&#39;ll 
just see if she has any jobs for Kirika and I to do. Excellent.

&quot;A job?&quot; Althena repeated curiously as the group sat around an 
uncomfortably quiet dinner table.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mireille answered, &quot;Kirika and I have been sitting around this 
house the past few days and I think it&#39;d be good if we went out. I was 
hoping you&#39;d have a task or something that needed doing so that we could 
leave for a while.&quot;

&quot;You know you are welcome to leave at any time but if you&#39;d like to do 
something for me I do have a few things that might be suitable,&quot; Althena 
replied kindly.

&quot;May I go as well, Althena?&quot; Chloe requested happily.

&quot;Yes, can Chloe go as well?&quot; Kirika asked serenely, drawing an elated 
look from Chloe and a not quite so elated look from Mireille.

&quot;Kirika, I don&#39;t think that would be such a good&#151;&quot;

&quot;I think that would be best,&quot; Althena replied, cutting Mireille off, 
&quot;Chloe knows what is to be expected on these missions.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Mireille grumbled, &quot;As long as we can go soon.&quot;</pre>
