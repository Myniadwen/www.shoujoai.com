<pre>Les Noir, ce mot designe depuis une
epoque lointaine le nom du destin.

Les deux vierges regnent sur la mort.

Les mains noires protegent
la paix des nouveaux-nes.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Erroneous thoughts strayed across her mind as she stared down at 
her now cold cup of tea. Paris was painfully bright today, as if the 
sun was amending for years of tempests and storms. Not that she 
noticed, or cared, underneath her baggy straw hat. Every now and then 
she would raise her eyes and take note of her surroundings: The suited 
man sitting three tables away reading a newspaper, the waiter, 
obviously bored at the slow business of the cafe, the stray cat 
partaking of leftovers on the floor. 
	Washed under the sun, everything seemed faded, as if taken from 
a scene in an 8mm film. The light and shadows splashed like waves 
against each other, vague and transluscent in the unhindered sun. The 
mind played tricks on the eyes, the delicate white of the cafe chairs 
glowed brighter than the stars in the sky, blanketing the earth in a 
cold sterile nothingness. The sounds of the city dimmed until only a 
breathless void remained. She could still smell the cofee, as she laid 
her head on the table. Two hours of waiting had taken their toll, and 
patience gave way to the rising tiredness of sleep. To sleep - 
perchance to dream.
	Kirika opened her eyes to grapes. An endless row of grapes 
stretching past the horizon. She stood to get a better view and felt 
cloth rustling against her legs. Examining herself, she was bearfoot 
and wearing a light blue sundress. A basket, half-filled lay next to 
her. She reached into a bushel and plucked a grape, tossing it in her 
mouth. She cringed at the sour taste assaulting her mouth. Not quite 
ripe. Sighing, she gathered the basket and walked west, along the 
endless groves that lay before her. 
	
	...Okaerinasai

	Kirika stopped in her tracks, dropping the basket and sending a 
few grapes to the earth. The Manor lay ahead of her, it&#39;s tall pillars 
and romanesque architecture reduced to a pitiful state of ashes and 
debris. Tendrils of smoke wafted lazily into the air, disappearing 
from sight. Leaving the basket where it was, she quickened her pace 
towards the charred remains, and stood impassive infront of the burnt 
doors, still standing despite the building&#39;s desolation.

					...Tadaima
 
	A gunshot, muffled from the thick wood, erupted from within the 
Manor, the harsh note still ringing in her ear as an encore sounded, 
and another, and finally silence. Her hands unknowingly clenched into 
fists and her body heaved, she stepped forward to open the doors. What 
she did not expect were the strong, forceful arms that held her back 
in a firm embrace pinning her arms uselessly to her sides. She felt a 
short, ticklish breath on her ear then the familiar sound of a 
melodious, childlike giggle. Struggle was useless, and instead of her 
natural response of aggression, she simply melted into the body, hard 
and lean, behind her.
	Chloe&#39;s eyes were closed as she pressed closer into Kirika, 
cheek to cheek, a sad smile on her face. The hunter green cloak 
fluttered in the wind, covering them both and almost mixing with the 
light blue of the sundress. All Kirika could see was the vague outline 
of her face, and the thin wisps of violet hair that rustled in the 
breeze and tickled ever so slightly. She found herself crying, the 
tears slowly rolling down her cheeks, causing strands of Chloe&#39;s hair 
to cling to her face.
	&quot;Chloe...&quot; The words caused the embrace to tighten, and lips to 
press once again in her ear. The wind rose higher, deafening her, 
drowning the world in its cacaphony. All Kirika could see of Chloe was 
her lips, set in a half smirk, hovering close to her ear. She heard 
nothing as Chloe spoke, the flowing of air the only thing audible, and 
the movements of her lips indecipherable. The only recognizable word 
was one she heard all too often, still terrifying in its intensity.
	&quot;...noir&quot;

	Yes, enough people had died for her sake, for Noir&#39;s sake. 
Nameless soldiers and assassins, Mireille&#39;s family, Chloe. This was 
Artena&#39;s legacy, to carry a pure blade to the world. In remembrance 
she had learned regret, regret for the countless dead. The heavy 
burden of guilt almost too much to uphold. But she was Noir...and Noir 
was a name for two.
	Mireille. Yes, Mireille. She did not know when Mireille had 
become her reason for existing. It was Mireille who had saved her, 
begged her to live, pleaded with an unspoken promise. A promise to 
experience life together, to seek light in the darkness of the world, 
and in the darkness of their own hearts. And she had accepted.
	
	Right now that promise was two hours late. Kirika once again 
found herself sitting in the trendy outdoors cafe. Two hours. They had 
agreed to meet here after Mireille had finished her weekly forays into 
the boutiques and shops that littered Paris like a disease. Perhaps 
Kirika should have gone with her, should have conceded to being 
Mireille&#39;s dress-up doll, at least then she would be aware of 
Mireailles position. Despite Kirika&#39;s rather dull response to the 
world of fashion, she did not find it unappealing to be noticed, 
pampered even, by the older woman. Not that she&#39;d actually go out and 
buy all those trendy parisian clothes herself.
	The waft of flowers filled her nose, overpowering the dry still 
air of Paris. Raising her head from out of her arms, Kirika chided 
herself for her absentmindedness. Too close, the smell. Maybe a block 
away. The wind carried the faded smell of roses, lillies, orchids, 
down towards her from some yet unseen person. Tensing slightly, eyes 
straight ahead, yet focused on her right, she awaited the 
flower-bearing messenger. Where was her gun...ah yes, she did not 
carry it around any more. Footsteps now, audible, the heavy click of 
womens shoes on the cobble stones, and from the corner, at last, the 
woman with the flowers, and an obnoxious, loud arrangement of every 
seemingly possible flower in existence. This being carried by a tired, 
yet smiling Mireille Bouquet.
	Mireille. Tension left Kirika&#39;s body, replaced by warmth and 
subdued happiness. She allowed herself a slight smile, imperceptable 
to all but the most observant. Mireille smiled back. And sat down, 
laying the bouquet between them.
	I&#39;m sorry for being late.
	It&#39;s okay.
	Brought flowers for the apartment...and for you.
	Silent they sat, and silent they left, never once uttering a 
word to each other.

end prologue.

Anyway...nothing much has happened. This was written mainly as an 
exercise in writing. I had a few scenes stuck in my head, and I wanted 
to see if I could get them down in words. I&#39;m not too unwholy 
unsatisfied, although it could still use alot of work.

As for the plot (yes, there is a plot) I was planning on making it 
character-centric, focusing on - but not necessarily narrated by - 
Kirika. Action will be few and far between. I dislike placing fight 
scenes for the sake of action, and in this story fights will have 
serious impact on our two heroines. So if you were looking for 
something where Kirika and Mireille shoot an entire army...sorry to 
dissapoint.

Anyway, the rest of the chapters are being done slowly. Veeeeerrrrry 
slowly. I&#39;m graduating highschool and the time I have to spend on 
activities is limited...but you didn&#39;t really need to know that.

fufufufu.
