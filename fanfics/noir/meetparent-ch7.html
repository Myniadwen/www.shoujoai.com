<a href="../noir/meetparent-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Kirika stared coldly at Mireille. The Japanese girl knew that the blonde 
was hiding something from her.

&quot;I can&#39;t tell you, Kirika.&quot; Mireille said in a serious tone.

The Japanese-looking girl asked calmly, &quot;Why..?&quot;

&quot;I just can&#39;t.&quot;

Kirika said nothing and continued staring at Mireille. The younger one 
of the two surely was stubborn.

The blonde tried her best to change the subjects. &quot;Have you fed Adeline 
today..?&quot;

No reply. All Mireille got was the stare.

&quot;Your last tea was delicious, Kirika.&quot;

Silence. Just a stare, once again.

Mireille felt some sweat suddenly dropped. &quot;Uh, you know.. It is my 
business.. So you can&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Kirika calmly stated. She continued stare at 
Mireille, silently.

Her sixth sense sure is something..

Mireille sighed. &quot;I just..&quot;

Kirika said nothing and waited something to be said by Mireille.

&quot;I met one of them.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Your parents.&quot;

&quot;..What.. do you mean..?&quot; the Japanese girl slowly asked.

&quot;One of them is alive.&quot; Mireille said calmly. &quot;I met with your mother.&quot;

&quot;...my.. mo..ther..?&quot; Kirika whispered slowly. &quot;Do I know her..?&quot;

Mireille nodded and said, &quot;Your mother... she seems to be..,&quot; Some sweat 
dropped from the blonde&#39;s forehead. &quot;Doctor Naomi.&quot;

Mireille looked at Kirika, ready to comfort the brunette if she in case 
wasn&#39;t ready yet to accept her mother existence. It was after all too 
sudden in Mireille&#39;s opinion, so the blonde somehow ready to face the 
consequences for what she had said.

But in return, Mireille saw the brunette smiled cheerfully. &quot;Oh.. 
really..?&quot;

The blonde was shocked to see Kirika accept the fact easily. &quot;Ye.. Yes.&quot;

&quot;Can I go and see her..?&quot; asked Kirika.

&quot;Of.. Of course.&quot; Mireille said, still surprised to see Kirika acted 
just as usual.

The brunette stood up. &quot;I&#39;ll go then. By myself.&quot;

And the day was over as Mireille was alone in the apartment. There was 
no the silent, expressionless Kirika there. It was just Mireille and the 
cat, Adeline. The day after that was also the same, because Kirika was 
barely seen in the apartment. The brunette started to meet with her 
mother everyday, from morning to night. It seemed that Dr. Naomi and 
Kirika had both became really closed to each other, as they met 
everyday. When Kirika came to the apartment, Mireille was usually still 
awake. But the brunette always felt sleepy at that time. So, the blonde 
would just let the Japanese-looking girl went to sleep.

One evening, Kirika suddenly came early into the apartment. As Mireille 
was about to greet Kirika for the unusual arrival,

&quot;Mireille.. Mom asked me to ask you about something..&quot; the brunette said 
just after she walked into the apartment and saw the blonde.

&quot;Eh.. What is it..?&quot;

The Japanese girl flushed slightly and asked, &quot;Will you be lonely.. if I 
leave..?&quot;

Surprised, Mireille asked, &quot;What.. do you mean..?&quot; The blonde tried to 
keep her cool, though her body heat seemed to increase a lot.

&quot;Mom will leave Paris and go to Japan.&quot; Kirika said softly. The Japanese 
girl was obviously happy about this, as she smiled cheerfully to 
Mireille. &quot;She asked me if I can leave with her.&quot;

&quot;Uh.. I see.. &quot; Mireille stuttered.

It can&#39;t be happen.. Somebody please tell me it&#39;s a lie..?

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mireille felt all her body heat was increased. She was sweaty and her 
clothes were all wet. Her heart had been pounded even wildly. When she 
looked around, she saw that she was in her own bed. In the apartment. 
She just had a nightmare, and fortunately had woken up from it. It was 
just a dream.. not reality.. When she saw the clock, the blonde realized 
that she had been asleep too long. It was already twelve o&#39;clock.

It was only been two days since Mireille knew that Dr. Naomi was maybe 
Kirika&#39;s mother. The thought of Kirika leaving really bothered Mireille, 
tough the blonde hadn&#39;t came to realize that it was the problem which 
cothering her so far. Mireille couldn&#39;t help but felt worried every time 
she remembered that Dr. Naomi was Kirika&#39;s mother. Why do I feel so 
worried..?

Mireille stood up from the bed and walked outside the bedroom. She saw 
Adeline was sleeping in the cage peacefully, as usual. Mireille observed 
the room. She looked at the window, the table, and the pool table. There 
was no one beside her in this room. Kirika wasn&#39;t here. Her heart beat 
began racing again. Did she leave..?!

Mireille ran at the bathroom, then the kitchen. Not there. She ran back 
to the bedroom in hurry. She felt relieved to see Kirika&#39;s clothes and 
belongings. Those things were still in her apartment. How fool of me. I 
haven&#39;t told her about anything..!

The Corsican girl smiled to herself and walked to the bathroom. She took 
a bath for about ten minutes. When Mireille had dressed up, the brunette 
still hadn&#39;t come back to the apartment. Tough Mireille felt some kind 
of worried, she reminded herself to be calm. She just goes somewhere, 
maybe shopping. Calm yourself.

Mireille looked out from the window. She searched for Kirika. But still, 
there was not a single sign from the brunette. It was getting darker and 
darker as Mireille waited for Kirika to come back. The blonde made some 
tea for herself, checked her laptop, and fed Adeline. Time flew by and 
Mireille finally felt that she couldn&#39;t wait any longer. It was already 
five o&#39;clock now. She changed her clothes and wore her jacket. The 
blonde hastily walked out from the apartment to the street.

Mireille walked in hurry and glanced at everyone she saw. Not a single 
person resembled the familiar oriental face she was searching for. The 
blonde went to the supermarket first, which was the most likely place 
for Kirika to stop by. Unfortunately the Japanese girl wasn&#39;t there. 
Then Mireille went to the pet shop. Not there, too. Mireille stopped by 
at every next shop she saw. Kirika was still nowhere to be found. 
Suddenly, Mireille remembered one place she hadn&#39;t gone to. She moved 
her feet slightly and walked to the park.

It was already night when Mireille arrived at the park. Just after she 
stepped in, she saw Kirika was sitting on the bench in the middle of the 
park. Their usual spot. Mireille took a deep breath and loose out a sigh 
of relief. Then, she ran to the bench. As she got closer, she saw that 
Kirika was not alone. There was somebody beside the brunette. Mireille 
had now been in front of Kirika, so she could see who the other person 
was. It was Dr. Naomi. Mireille completely ignored the female vet and 
looked at Kirika.

&quot;Mireille..&quot; whispered Kirika.

&quot;... Don&#39;t you leave a message for me..?&quot; Mireille asked, tried to be 
calm. The blonde was relieved to see Kirika, but also at the same time 
kind of angry, a little.

Kirika answered calmly, &quot;I did.&quot;

Mireille was confused, &quot;Where..?&quot;

&quot;At our usual place.&quot;

After thinking for a while, Mireille was ashamed of herself. She forgot 
to check that place. The vase.

Mireille felt embarrassed to be worry like she was now. &quot;Uh.. I forgot 
to check it.&quot;

The Japanese girl laughed. Dr. Naomi, who was beside the brunette also 
laughed slightly.

Suddenly Dr. Naomi stood up. &quot;It&#39;s unfortunate that I have to leave.&quot; 
she said, smiling.

&quot;We can talk again tomorrow.&quot; Kirika said as she looked up at the female 
doctor who was standing in front of her.

Dr. Naomi smiled grew wider, &quot;Of course.&quot; The female vet then looked at 
Mireille and said, &quot;I&#39;ll be going then&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot; said Mireille.

&quot;Goodbye, girls.&quot; Dr. Naomi said as she walked forward, leaving the 
park.

Mireille watched as Dr. Naomi left the park. After that, the blonde sat 
herself beside Kirika.

&quot;I went shopping for the kitchen needs.&quot; Kirika whispered.

Mireille muttered, &quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Are you worried..?&quot; the Japanese looking girl asked innocently.

Mireille felt her heart stopped beating for once at the moment she heard 
the question. She felt her face became hotter. She said slowly, &quot;... Not 
really..&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Kirika shortly said, and smiled slightly.

&quot;Did you meet Dr. Naomi coincidentally..?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;May I know what the two of you were talking about..?&quot;

Kirika looked at the blonde. &quot;First she said sorry to me. About 
yesterday.&quot;

&quot;I see..&quot;

&quot;Then, she started talking about family.&quot; said the Japanese girl.

&quot;Looks like she fancy talking about it.&quot;

Kirika laughed. &quot;Seems so.&quot;

&quot;Anything interesting beside it..?&quot; Mireille asked, curious.

&quot;Um.. No.&quot; Kirika simply answered.

&quot;Well then..&quot; Mireille looked at the sky. &quot;It&#39;s getting dark and cold. 
Let&#39;s go home.&quot;

It had started to rain when both Mireille and Kirika arrived at the 
apartment.

&quot;I&#39;ll make tea.&quot; Kirika said as she headed to the kitchen.

Mireille threw herself on the chair, waiting for the tea Kirika was 
making. Not too long after that, the brunette came out from the kitchen 
while carrying a tea pot.

The older of the two stood up and said, &quot;I&#39;ll get the cups.&quot; The blonde 
headed to the kitchen and took two cups and brought it to the table. 
Then, she threw herself on the chair beside Kirika.

Mireille glanced at Kirika. &quot;Um.. Kirika..&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; said the Japanese girl as she poured the tea.

&quot;I never asked this before... Uh..&quot; Mireille tried to arrange the word 
she was going to use. &quot;Do you remember the face of your family..?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kirika stated calmly. The brunette still wore her expressionless 
face as she asked, &quot;Why..?&quot;

&quot;Just wanna know.&quot; The blonde took her tea. &quot;So, you really don&#39;t 
remember anything from the past, even your family..?&quot;

Kirika gazed at her cup, and whispered, &quot;I.. I don&#39;t really know.. 
whether I still have a family or not.&quot;

&quot;Eh..?&quot; Mireille asked, perplexed.

&quot;I have a feeling that they have died.&quot; Kirika whispered slowly. &quot;My 
family.&quot;

Mireille looked at Kirika, didn&#39;t know what to say.

&quot;Maybe we&#39;re the same..&quot; Kirika said softly. The Japanese girl then 
lowered her head. &quot;If just I.. &quot; her voice was even sadder than before. 
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry.. for killed your family, Mireille.&quot;

Mireille eyes grew wider. Again, Kirika apologized to her about this 
matter, tough the blonde had forgiven her. &quot;Kirika..&quot; Mireille took the 
brunette&#39;s hand and hold it.

This sudden contact made Kirika looked up and saw the blonde&#39;s face. 
Mireille placed her other hand on the brunette&#39;s cheek and smiled. &quot;I 
have forgiven you, remember.&quot;

&quot;Yes..&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault either.&quot; said Mireille, as her blue orbs gazed at 
Kirika&#39;s beautiful orbs.

Both Kirika and Mireille were now sitting very close to one another. 
Tough neither of the two realized that they leaned closer to each other.

The Japanese girl startled Mireille by placing one of her little hand on 
the blonde&#39;s too. &quot;It is warm.. Your hand..&quot; she said softly.

At that moment, Mireille got the sudden urge to kiss Kirika. As she 
leaned forward to Kirika...She suddenly stopped herself. No. You can&#39;t.

Mireille took off all her hands on the brunette and looked away, hiding 
her face whose cheeks turned red. Kirika looked at the blonde, confused.

&quot;Sorry.. Uh...&quot; The blonde hesitated to speak up.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Kirika smiled.

Mireille flushed a bit. How come I feel like kissing her..??

&quot;Are you going to tell me something..?&quot; Kirika asked innocently. This 
time it was Kirika who reached the blonde&#39;s hand. The Japanese-looking 
girl held Mireille&#39;s hand within both her hands.

The blonde reacted to this warm contact and looked up to see Kirika 
smiled at her. But still, Mireille hesitated to tell the brunette. She 
shut her mouth.

During her mute, a thought suddenly appeared in Mireille&#39;s mind. What 
will Kirika do when she knows about Dr. Naomi..? Will she... leave me..?

&quot;Mireille..?&quot;

&quot;Kirika.. What if your family were still alive..?&quot; Mireille asked 
quickly.

&quot;Huh..?&quot; A look of confused was on Kirika&#39;s face. The brunette then 
became quiet, as if she was thinking about something.

Mireille waited patiently for Kirika to reply.

&quot;Uh.. I don&#39;t know.&quot; The brunette replied shortly and looked at 
Mireille. &quot;Why..?&quot;

Mireille felt relieved to hear the answer. &quot;I just.. There is a 
possibility, right..&quot; said the blonde.

Kirika gave a look of disbelief on Mireille.

&quot;I just happened to feel that way.&quot;

The brunette asked in a soft voice, &quot;Do you meet with someone..?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Mireille felt that she had said too much for now, as the topic was 
getting more specific. The blonde decided to not speak further. She knew 
Kirika had a sharp instinct.

&quot;No. I just saw a person looked like you passed by.&quot; Mireille lied, and 
tried to say it lightly. &quot;But now that I think of it.. She doesn&#39;t 
really look like you..&quot;

Kirika looked at Mireille silently, as she said nothing. Fortunately 
Mireille stopped herself for telling the Japanese girl about Dr. Naomi. 
Somehow Kirika seemed attracted to the last topic. Dr. Naomi must tell 
Kirika by herself, remember.

&quot;Maybe you will meet that person, one day.&quot; Mireille smiled as she said 
that.

Mireille felt relieved that Kirika didn&#39;t ask something else. Rather, 
the brunette was quietly sipping her tea. Mireille&#39;s mind went to Dr. 
Naomi. What is she going to do..?

&quot;Mireille..&quot; Kirika called the blonde&#39;s name.

Mireille glanced at Kirika, a bit worried about what was Kirika going to 
talk about.

&quot;Tomorrow I will go to Dr. Naomi&#39;s clinic.&quot; the brunette said.

&quot;Oh..? What for..?&quot;

&quot;She said she has something she would like me to help.&quot;

&quot;Okay.. No problem.&quot;

A week was over since Kirika was told to come to help Dr. Naomi&#39;s at the 
clinic. The Japanese girl was offered a job to become an assistant of a 
vet. It was a reasonable job for Kirika who love animals. Kirika asked 
Mireille about this first, before making her decision whether to accept 
it or not. Mireille gladly allowed the brunette to do what she would 
like to do. Now it had been also a week since Kirika started working at 
Dr. Naomi&#39;s clinic.

The thing was, the Japanese girl worked from 9a.m in the morning until 5 
p.m. Kirika would come home and chat for a while with Mireille, then 
went to sleep. The brunette obviously must be tired, helping all day. At 
first, not much different was made. But as time passed by, Mireille 
couldn&#39;t help but felt lonely. The blonde was alone in the apartment 
everyday, waiting for Kirika to come back. It was as if the horrible 
dream Mireille had before came true.

Actually Mireille could just make up some reason and stay in the clinic 
until Kirika had done with her work. But, the blonde had some kind of 
feeling that Dr. Naomi made this opportunity to get close to Kirika. And 
it was also rude. As somebody who knew the true identity of that female 
vet, she couldn&#39;t just disturb them. The blonde let out a sigh.

Mireille herself still didn&#39;t understand why Kirika&#39;s existence bothered 
her so much. It was as if having the Japanese girl less than a half 
daytime in a day had drive her to be a loner.

Mireille knew that she had paid some attention for the Japanese girl 
since a long time ago. She adored the cute and innocent look on the 
brunette&#39;s face, which sometimes would make her blush. She loved to hear 
the words spoken by Kirika, more than a singing angel. She missed 
Kirika&#39;s laughter. Mireille actually loved to see the enigmatic aura the 
Japanese-girl had, and drank the tea the brunette made. She would also 
love to gaze longer at the Japanese girl&#39;s beautiful brown pair of eyes. 
She didn&#39;t expect that she would miss Kirika very much like she was now.

Now that Kirika had no longer spent too much time with her, Mireille had 
come to realize. I miss her.. Does this mean that.. I... love her?

A sound of a door opened startled Mireille. She glanced at the door and 
saw the face of the one she had been longing to embrace.

&quot;Kirika..?&quot; asked Mireille, confused. &quot;You&#39;ve done working today..?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; was all the brunette replied. Kirika then walked to the bedroom 
quietly.

Something&#39;s wrong with her. Mireille decided to head to the bedroom. 
When she stepped in, she saw Kirika was laying on the bed, with her own 
face buried to the pillow.

Mireille said nothing and sat herself beside Kirika. The soft movement 
on the bed must be enough for the brunette to realize Mireille&#39;s 
presence. From the look above, Mireille could tell that the Japanese 
girl was neither sick nor sleep. What happened..? Did Dr. Naomi say 
something to her..?

The blonde decided to lay on the bed too. She faced Kirika, whose face 
wasn&#39;t able to be seen while was buried in the pillows. Mireille 
reluctantly stopped herself to hug Kirika, afraid whether the gesture 
would be refused by the brunette. So Mireille just remained silent 
there, accompanying Kirika. A few minutes passed, and finally the 
younger of the two opened up her mouth.

&quot;I am... confused.&quot; A soft unclear voice came from Kirika. The Japanese 
girl still buried her face into the pillows.

&quot;Why..?&quot; asked Mireille.

&quot;She.. suddenly hugged me so tight.&quot; Kirika&#39;s voice was barely clear, 
but Mireille somehow could understand.

&quot;I see..&quot; She can&#39;t be a little more patient eh, that damn doctor..

&quot;But that&#39;s not the problem. Doctor Naomi..&quot; Kirika turned around and 
now her face was facing Mireille. &quot;She said sorry to me and continued 
telling me her story.&quot; her voice could clearly be heard now.

Both of them were now facing each other, while laying on the bed they 
usually shared.

&quot;Story..?&quot; Mireille asked softly. The blonde quietly enjoyed gazing 
continuously at the brown orbs in front of her. It had been a long time 
since she did so.

&quot;She told me..&quot; Kirika closed her eyes. &quot;She told me about her life.. 
Her family, her dream.. &quot;

Mireille quietly listened to the brunette.

&quot;Dr. Naomi told me an event which happened a long time ago. She told me 
the details, why did she do that, when did she do it.. everything.&quot; 
Kirika opened her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t know why.., but I felt my heart was 
ripped apart as I heard that story even further.&quot; She said in a sad 
tone. &quot;It was as if... I could feel all the pain.&quot;

&quot;What is the story about..?&quot; Mireille asked, curious.

&quot;It was a story when she threw her daughter away.&quot; Kirika simply said.

Mireille was shocked. Dr. Naomi was surprisingly brave and at the same 
time, an idiot to suddenly told Kirika the story. Tough Mireille didn&#39;t 
know how Kirika was thrown away, it definitely must be sad story, for 
Kirika to wear the expression she was now having.

&quot;I kind of... familiar with it.&quot; said Kirika softly.

Mireille gave a look of comforting to Kirika, and took one of Kirika&#39;s 
hand and hold it tight. &quot;Is that what make you feel like now..?&quot;

&quot;That story was somehow give me a bad feeling..&quot; Kirika whispered. &quot;So I 
decided to come back early today.&quot; Kirika grasp at Mireille&#39;s hand. &quot;And 
I have a feeling.. that you know something important realted to me.&quot;

Mireille tried to keep calm. She looked at Kirika and said, &quot;Yes. But I 
can&#39;t tell you.&quot;

&quot;Why..?&quot; Kirika&#39;s eyes reflected some sadness.

&quot;It isn&#39;t me who suppose to tell you, Kirika.&quot; Mireille said seriously.

&quot;Then who..?&quot; Kirika insisted to know.

&quot;... I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;

Mireille and Kirika both gazed to each other, while their hands were 
clutched to one another. Mireille felt guilty, as she hided something 
from the brunette.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind... knowing from you.&quot; Kirika whispered slowly.

&quot;It is not.. appropriate.&quot; said Mireille calmly.

&quot;Can you please.. tell me..?&quot; begged Kirika.

Mireille became speechless at the moment. She was fighting with herself, 
deep inside her mind and heart. If I tell her, I&#39;m afraid that I will 
lose her. But.. she will know, sooner or later..

The blonde made up her mind. &quot;You know..&quot; muttered Mireille. &quot;The 
conversation I had with Dr. Naomi wasn&#39;t about my family, but yours.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean..?&quot; Kirika asked softly.

&quot;She said to me that...&quot; Mireille looked at Kirika and saw the pair of 
brown eyes was focusing on her blue orbs. &quot;She is... your mother.&quot; 
Mireille clutched Kirika&#39;s hand tightly while saying this.

Kirika remained silent for the next minutes. Mireille on the other hand, 
gently looked at the brunette.

&quot;Are you okay, Kirika..?&quot; Mireille broke the silence between them.

&quot;Yeah..&quot; a small voice replied her question. &quot;No wonder... She is very 
kind to me..&quot;

&quot;You believe that she is your mother..?

Kirika sighed. &quot;I.. don&#39;t know..&quot; The brunette looked at Mireille. &quot;What 
do you think..?&quot;

&quot;For me, she somehow seems convincing.&quot; whispered Mireille.

Kirika said nothing in return. She closed her eyes.

Mireille asked softly, &quot;What do you want to do.. now?&quot;

The Japanese girl opened her brilliant brown eyes and said calmly, &quot;I 
want to ask her a lot of things.&quot;

With that answer, Mireille changed her clothes as Kirika waited for her. 
Finished with dressing up, the two of them went to the clinic. It was 
about six when they arrived at the front door of the clinic. They 
knocked, and the door was opened by no one else but Dr. Naomi.

Dr. Naomi smiled as usual with no sign of surprise and greeted them, 
&quot;Welcome.&quot;

Neither Kirika nor Mireille replied her smile. They just stood still and 
said nothing.

Dr. Naomi saw this and asked in a low voice, &quot;A serious talk, I 
assume..?&quot; Her smile faded away. She then made a gesture for the two to 
follow her.

Both Kirika and Mireille silently stepped into the clinic. Once again 
they were led to the room they had been before, the white living room. 
They sat at their exact position as before. Mireille and Kirika on the 
sofa, while the female vet sat on the chair. No one said a word after 
that. Dr. Naomi simply shut her mouth and looked down nervously. The 
blonde realized this and assumed that the female vet must have known the 
reason why they came.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I have already told her.&quot; Mireille finally opened up the 
conversation.

&quot;I see..&quot; Dr. Naomi looked down at her shoes, obviously avoided contact 
with Kirika.

&quot;Kirika..&quot; Mireille said the Japanese girl name softly, as she glanced 
at the brunette. She saw that Kirika still remained her calm and 
expressionless face as ever.

To Mireille surprise, Kirika suddenly looked up and glared at Dr. Naomi. 
&quot;I hate you.&quot; she simply declared.

It was the first time for Mireille to see Kirika behaved this way to 
others. So the blonde decided to have her mouth shut.

&quot;I know. You have the right to be.&quot; Dr. Naomi said in a sad tone, still 
hadn&#39;t dare to look up.

&quot;But..&quot; muttered Kirika. &quot;I&#39;m glad you are alive.&quot; she said softly.

Dr. Naomi looked surprised and shocked at first as she suddenly looked 
at Kirika. &quot;Do you.. believe me that I&#39;m your mother..?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s brown orbs observed Dr. Naomi for a while as she remained 
quiet. Then, she looked up at Dr. Naomi. The female vet spontaneously 
looked at Kirika. Brown orbs met with brown orbs.

Kirika finally nodded very slowly. This soft gesture blew up a relieved 
smile from Dr. Naomi. &quot;Thank you.&quot; she said.

Felt that she wasn&#39;t suppose to be with them at this moment, Mireille 
slowly stood up and walked to the door.

When she was about to open the door, Kirika said softly to her, &quot;Wait 
for me, will you..?&quot;

Mireille smiled and nodded at the Japanese girl, then stepped out of the 
room.</pre>
