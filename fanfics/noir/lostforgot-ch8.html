<h1>Lost But Not Forgotten, Forgotten But Not Lost (part 8 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../noir/index.html">Noir</a>

<a href="../noir/lostforgot-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;So, what, you&#39;re like some highly-trained mail courier?&quot; Mireille 
jested mockingly as the trio of assassins waited in the darkness for the 
contact to which they were to deliver one of a myriad of letters.

Chloe remained silent, instead opting to hug her heavy cloak tighter 
against the cold night air. Russia was not the place to be in 
mid-November. As Mireille shivered against the cold Chloe smirked, &quot;Is 
that miniskirt special enough to die of hypothermia for?&quot;

Mireille scowled, &quot;I should just kill you right now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to see you try,&quot; Chloe shot back.

&quot;Please, stop,&quot; the meager plea from Kirika drew the two out of their 
rivalry as they peered at the young Japanese girl huddled against the 
stonework of an old building, her eyes closed in thought, &quot;Why do you 
always seem to fight?&quot;

Mireille sighed inwardly; Well if Chloe wasn&#39;t such an immature brat . . 
. she wasn&#39;t even invited on this trip, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

The trio raised their eyes as a broken-down old truck rattled up to the 
curb on the opposite side of the street. Two men in long coats stepped 
out, obviously guns for hire, and walked lazily across the cobblestone 
street, approaching the women cautiously.

Chloe pushed herself up off of the wall on which she was leaning, 
meeting the men at the curb, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

The unidentified men grinned, one of them laughing rather hoarsely as 
they each pulled out looming desert eagles and began firing on the 
assassins. Quick to the draw Kirika already had whipped out her berretta 
and taken cover behind a large dumpster. Mireille had done likewise, 
drawing her firearm and taking refuge behind an outcropping in the 
decaying old building beside her. Like lightning Chloe was in the air, 
using a nearby trashcan to vault her into the air as she landed 
gracefully with her knees on the shoulders of one gunman. With a smooth 
twist of her body she brought the man flailing backwards, snapping his 
neck cleanly. She whirled around, prepared to assail the second gunman 
who had turned to face his slain companion when her face and front were 
splattered with crimson blood, the gunman fallen by a bullet from one of 
the assassins behind him.

Kirika and Mireille stepped out from their shelters tentatively, 
assessing the situation while Chloe spit a mouthful of the man&#39;s blood 
onto the street.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Kirika inquired of her, concerned the younger girl 
may have been grazed by the bullet that had killed the gun-for-hire.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Chloe nodded, wiping her face and hands on the shirt of one 
of the dead man she had taken down, &quot;This was a set up, a trap.&quot;

&quot;No shit, Sherlock,&quot; Mireille grumbled, then noticing the assassin 
glaring menacingly, apologized quickly, though not that sincerely.

After a quick examination it was decided that the contact had been the 
source of the hit men and that the next course of action would be to 
retire for the evening to their hotel.

I wish Althena had let me get the room that the Soldats usually provide 
for me. It&#39;s so much bigger and it reminds me of home, Chloe sighed, 
looking at the large suite in one of the more upscale hotels in the 
city, If only that Corsican hadn&#39;t come then Kirika and I could have 
shared that room . . . like we used to do. Oh, damn, not again, Chloe 
kicked herself mentally for such thoughts as she felt her face redden 
slightly, hoping the other women wouldn&#39;t notice.

&quot;Humph, I wouldn&#39;t think Althena would be able to afford something this 
nice,&quot; Mireille scoffed, taking stock of the suite. There were two 
bedrooms, each with an exceptionally large bed, on either side of a 
common room with a fireplace, TV, mini-bar, etc, &quot;I expected some 
thatched roof hut,&quot; she chuckled at her own joke.

&quot;Providers of our accommodations are very generous,&quot; Chloe said stonily, 
careful not to mention the identity of that provider as she shed her 
cloak and folded it carefully.

&quot;I&#39;ll sleep here,&quot; Mireille put her hand on one of the doors leading to 
one of the bedrooms, yawning loudly, &quot;Good night. Coming, Kirika?&quot;

Chloe&#39;s head shot up from her arsenal of knives she had been removing 
from her person, &quot;There are plenty of places to sleep here. She can 
sleep in the other room, I will sleep on the couch,&quot; she said icily, How 
dare she assume that Kirika would sleep with her when there were other 
options. Humph, now I will be able to sleep between them, that way she 
won&#39;t try anything.

Mireille narrowed her eyes, making it obvious to the youngest of the 
trio that she knew her motives, &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she half-growled, &quot;Kirika 
and I are used to it,&quot; she smirked, somehow knowing that for whatever 
reason that would cut the assassin deeply.

&quot;I-I can sleep on the couch,&quot; Kirika offered, turning to Chloe, &quot;You can 
have the other bed; I&#39;ll sleep on the couch.&quot;

Chloe nodded stonily, &quot;If that&#39;s what you would like,&quot; I&#39;ll have to stay 
alert, who knows what that Corsican whore might try.

Ugh, Kirika, you&#39;re falling right into her trap. Who knows what that 
little freak might try? She&#39;ll probably slit your throat while you 
sleep. I&#39;ll have to stay alert; Mireille thought resolutely, nodding to 
herself, &quot;Alright then, it&#39;s settled. I&#39;ll have this room, Chloe will 
have that room, Kirika will sleep on the couch,&quot; she finished her 
sentence by meeting Chloe&#39;s glare as they stood in a sort of staring 
contest, neither willing to leave Kirika alone with the other.

Kirika sprawled out on the couch, the face-off between her friends 
unnoticed as she stretched hugely and drifted quickly to sleep. Seeing 
that the object of their rivalry had fallen to sleep the pair of 
assassins still glaring at each other relinquished their posts, each 
retreating into their rooms.

Mireille sat cross-legged on her bed, cleaning her pistol carefully as 
she strained to listen toward the other room. I still don&#39;t trust that 
girl. Kirika seems at ease around her; she thinks she knows her. But 
Kirika is young and foolish; I won&#39;t fall into their trap so easily. I 
will just have to be on guard for Kirika as well, before she gets in 
over her head.

If only she could have had her little identity crisis somewhere else. 
Why in the middle of all of this Soldats stuff. It would be so much 
easier for Kirika, and for me, if we didn&#39;t have to deal with these 
freaks giving her any ideas. She&#39;s so susceptible right now and they&#39;re 
taking advantage of it. Mireille growled audibly at her frustration, 
however, if I want to get my answers I&#39;ll have to stick with it. With 
any luck they will come soon.

Having finished cleaning her firearm, Mireille pressed her ear to her 
door once more. Satisfied that Chloe wasn&#39;t doing anything at the moment 
the Corsican settled down in her bed for a light sleep, staying alert 
for anything the youngest of the trio might try.</pre>
