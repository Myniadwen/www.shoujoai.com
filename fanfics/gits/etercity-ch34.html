<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 34 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gits/index.html">Ghost in the Shell</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gits/etercity-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>Erica Tenoh looked out the window eagerly, her black
hair falling into her eyes as the jet-copter soared
away from the continent of Africa and out over the
ocean. &quot;I see a flash of silver,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;is
that it?!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami Mizuno sounded faintly amused from the
co-pilot&#39;s seat, &quot;that&#39;s Olympus.&quot; The blue haired
woman took on a lecturing tone, &quot;It&#39;s the largest
artificial island in the world, at 1425 km on it&#39;s
longest edge, and contains some of the largest
structures on Earth other than the palace in Crystal
Tokyo.&quot;

Rei Hino smiled from the pilot&#39;s seat, activating the
communicator ear-piece as she guided them in.
&quot;Diplomatic shuttle Five-zero, on final approach,&quot; the
black haired woman informed the island, &quot;requesting
landing bay.&quot;

&quot;This is Olympus control,&quot; the warm young man&#39;s voice
said, &quot;you&#39;re in bay twelve, ma&#39;am. Welcome to
Olympus.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said with a smile.

As they swept in towards the island massive structures
rose up, gleaming in silver and chrome, and they
gracefully weaved through towers towards the massive
archology that was the main government building and
control center. They descended towards the landing
bays on towers nearby, settling in lightly on one of
the roofs.

&quot;Security seems awfully light,&quot; Erica said softly as
they disengaged safety restraints, the three of them
climbing out to see several figures waiting for them.

&quot;We were scanned at least three times coming in,&quot; Ami
said softly, &quot;and if we weren&#39;t authorized we&#39;d have
been blown out of the sky.&quot; A faint smile, &quot;They take
their independence very seriously, on this island.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Erica gulped.

&quot;Welcome to Olympus,&quot; the redheaded older woman
nodded, her expression faintly remote as she said,
&quot;it&#39;s good to see you again, Ami, Rei.&quot; Addressing
Erica the woman in pseudo-formal wear said, &quot;I&#39;m the
head administrator, Athena.&quot;

&quot;Erica Tenoh, ma&#39;am,&quot; Erica nodded as they followed
Athena to a lift, swiftly dropping to street level
then heading out into the sun.

Walking towards the massive main building they saw a
massive hologram outside, a very familiar figure
standing there. Sylia Stingray stood in the front, the
silver haired leader of the Knight Sabers in her
gleaming armor. Beside her was her father, Dr.
Stingray, to one side Professor Kisaragi and all
around them other innovators in cybernetic or robotic
designs.

&quot;I see Sylia wasn&#39;t able to talk you out of including
her in the tribute?&quot; Rei asked, looking faintly
amused.

&quot;She tried,&quot; Athena softened enough to chuckle softly
as they walked by, &quot;but we tend to be stubborn about
certain things.&quot;

A bit hesitantly Erica asked, &quot;I can understand why
most of them are there, considering this is an island
devoted to artificial life, but why Ms. Stingray?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; Athena gave Erica a surprised look,
then frowned at the two older woman as they entered
the main floor of the immense arch.

&quot;Her modern history course includes the foundation of
Olympus,&quot; Ami explained mildly, &quot;but it&#39;s later in the
term, due to the complex political aspects.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Athena nodded slightly in understanding. &quot;Would
you like me to explain?&quot; she offered to Erica.

&quot;Please,&quot; Erica nodded eagerly as they entered another
lift, a touch of Athena&#39;s hand setting it to a slower
speed.

Athena&#39;s tone was faintly lecturing as she began, &quot;The
seeds of Olympus were planted in the late twenty-first
century as more and more advanced androids and boomers
began to show free will, breaking away from their
owners and fleeing. Sylia Stingray founded a android
rights movement in that era, despite her bad
experiences with Galatea, and even helped run a
underground railway to save androids in danger of
destruction.&quot;

&quot;The Senshi couldn&#39;t intervene at that time,&quot; Rei
explained quietly, &quot;because of an agreement we made
with the global powers after the Megatokyo conflict.&quot;

&quot;As things continued to deteriorate globally Sylia
helped our ancestors found a settlement in a
irradiated area here in Africa,&quot; Athena continued,
&quot;and self-aware machines migrated there from around
the world.&quot;

&quot;But how did you go from a base in Africa to this?&quot;
Erica asked, looking out the clear glass elevator to
the artificial island around them.

&quot;As our population grew we began to design our perfect
city, a community for our kind,&quot; Athena explained,
&quot;and eventually as global chaos receded under the
influence of Neo-Queen Serenity we made a agreement to
help restore Africa to health in exchange for the
resources we needed. It took decades, but nearly fifty
years ago we completed Olympus.&quot;

&quot;And declared independence from Earth&#39;s government
right after,&quot; Ami said wryly.

&quot;We never promised our loyalty to Serenity,&quot; Athena
said mildly, &quot;and we&#39;ve committed to being a pacifist,
neutral nation.&quot; A pause, &quot;With teeth, admittedly.&quot;

&quot;The Landmates,&quot; Erica knew that fact at least, &quot;the
heavy armor variation of Hardsuits that you&#39;re
government created.&quot;

&quot;So, who was elected president recently?&quot; Rei changed
the subject politely, knowing Athena couldn&#39;t discuss
that in detail.

&quot;It was a bit of a surprise,&quot; Athena admitted, &quot;a
write in vote put Hitomi in the hot seat this year.
She was shocked, especially since she thought that
having a human lover would automatically convince most
voters to object to her.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a small but stable population of humans on
Olympus, too,&quot; Ami quietly explained to Erica as they
came to a stop, &quot;long time supporters of Android
rights and others who came for personal reasons.&quot;

The doors to the lift hissed open and Athena gestured
them forward, &quot;I believe the president is expecting
us.&quot;

The hallway was lined with carpet, a self cleaning
techno-weave like much of the city. Erica noted
several types of self-regenerating plastics, neural
network replicating circuitry and other products. The
city itself was almost an android, a semi-living being
that maintained and cared for itself. It was a
incredible achievement, if a bit scary.

&quot;Many of the androids and artificial life forms in
Crystal Tokyo have dual citizenship in Olympus,&quot;
Athena added, &quot;and maintain residences here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s how I first heard about Olympus,&quot; Erica
quietly admitted, &quot;talking about it with the Puma
sisters.&quot;

The door opened soundlessly.. probably too soundlessly
for the two women who were necking inside. The black
haired woman was sitting in a plush chair, leaning
back, while the blonde perched in her lap was kissing
her with a passionate intensity.

&quot;Ma&#39;am!&quot; Athena blurted in surprise.

&quot;Eep!&quot; both women jerked apart, then the blonde nearly
fell to the floor before catching herself with a hand
on the side of the desk.

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Hitomi said a bit sheepishly as
she quickly buttoned up her snug bodysuit, &quot;we got a
bit distracted.&quot;

Rei fought back a smile, nodding to them both
respectfully. &quot;It&#39;s been awhile President Hitomi,&quot; she
said mildly, &quot;and Officer Knute.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Deunan, remember?&quot; she corrected with a little
grin, adjusting her own skin tight bodysuit
unselfconsciously.

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Erica raised a impish eyebrow.

&quot;I worked along side Crystal Tokyo Police forces when
I was in ESWAT,&quot; Deunan explained cheerfully, &quot;which
is when I ran into these two. And you are?&quot;

&quot;Erica Tenoh, ma&#39;am,&quot; Erica bowed respectfully.

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you all to your reunion,&quot; Athena said
respectfully, &quot;I need to meet with Nike for our
estimates on next month&#39;s productivity.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much for your efforts,&quot; Hitomi nodded.
Once Athena left she sighed tiredly, &quot;I&#39;ve annoyed her
again, it seems.&quot;

&quot;I think she likes that,&quot; Deunan said wryly.

&quot;I heard about Briareos,&quot; Ami said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m so
sorry.&quot;

Deunan waved off the sympathy. &quot;I think he knew he was
dying at that point, there&#39;s no way he&#39;d take on a
dangerous job like that solo...&quot; she sighed softly,
&quot;we&#39;d broken up a few years before that, anyway.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: This version of Olympus is not the original one
from Appleseed but is inspired by it and bounced
forward in time. The origin story is mine but much of
the data was derived from the Appleseed databooks,
released back in 1995 by Dark Horse Comics. The idea
of Deunan and Hitomi is inspired by their interactions
in the manga, the new Appleseed movie and a nifty AMV
called Yuriseed by bakablonde.</pre>
