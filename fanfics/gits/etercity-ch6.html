<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 6 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gits/index.html">Ghost in the Shell</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gits/etercity-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>       Ami Mizuno gave a smile and a nod to the young woman guarding 
the door tonight at the Locket. &quot;Cyber Six,&quot; she recognized the 
leather clad woman enough to ask her, &quot;what&#39;s a police detective doing 
on bouncer duty?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s a favor to a friend,&quot; Cyber Six explained in her husky 
voice, pushing her black hair back from her face one-handedly. She 
opened the door for Ami with a sweeping gesture, &quot;Go on in, Prof. 
Mizuno.&quot;

        Ami blushed, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        One of the major advantages of being a Sailor Senshi had been 
the concealment of their previous mortal identities. To most of the 
world &#39;Lady Mercury&#39; was the only identity that she had, so 
re-establishing &#39;Ami Mizuno&#39; in the city&#39;s records hadn&#39;t been all 
that hard to do. Deciding to be safe she created the public image of 
being a reclusive scientific genius, so that the rare appearances of 
&#39;Ami&#39; weren&#39;t too unusual.

        Ruri nodded to her with a smile, &quot;Good to see you again.&quot; The 
captain of the Nadesico didn&#39;t look at all out of place there, her 
calm manner soothing anyone who came in.

        &#39;I wonder if May is going to try to get her to become a 
regular?&#39; she wondered even as Ami asked, &quot;Is Victoria Ceres here 
tonight?&quot;

        Ruri surprised her with a soft chuckle, &quot;Check out the karaoke 
stage.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Ami smiled, moving into the crowds. She had arranged 
to meet Victoria here because the Locket was widely known to be 
neutral territory, and anyone who broke that rule usually faced the 
combined wrath of everyone else there.

        &#39;I know things were hard for her, being a vampire,&#39; Ami 
thought grimly. &#39;I hope that it hasn&#39;t made her a harder woman than 
she was,&#39; she reflected. She made her way to the stage and stopped 
cold, her eyes wide. &#39;Then again,&#39; she thought whimsically, &#39;maybe 
not.&#39;

        Victoria stood up on the stage, an impish smile on her face. 
Right there beside her, a smile looking a bit odd on her normally 
serious face, was Integra Hellsing! Victoria had the mike, and was 
singing to her blushing vampire companion with a charming grin...

        &quot;I died, so many years ago
        And you can make me feel
        Like it isn&#39;t so
        But why you come to be with me
        I think I&#39;ve always known

        Never scared
        Embracing what you feel
        And you can tell the one you love
        You know I always deal
        Go whisper in this dead girl&#39;s ear
        I&#39;ll always make it real

        That&#39;s great
        And I always wanna play
        &#39;Cause being with you touches me
        More than I can say
        And since I&#39;m still the dead to you
        I&#39;m saying come and stay
        And let us rest in peace,&quot;

        The number got a bit more rock and roll, and Victoria took on 
a bit of an flamboyant strut as she continued on singing to her,

        &quot;Let us rest in peace
        Let&#39;s go get some sleep
        Let&#39;s take our love and bury it
        In a hole six foot deep
        We can lay our bodies down there
        And find that sweet release
        So let&#39;s go rest in peace!&quot;

        To the cheering of the crowd the two vampires stepped down 
from the stage, noticing Ami standing nearby almost immediately. 
Victoria smiled, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Mercury.&quot; A raised eyebrow, 
&quot;Would you care to join us at our table?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d be glad to,&quot; Ami smiled back at her, not surprised that 
she recognized her. &#39;When did Integra Hellsing become a vampire?&#39; she 
wondered as she followed them over to a corner table. Victoria 
gentlemanly held out a chair for Integra, who smiled up at her 
gratefully.

        Ami took a seat, wondering quite how she should start the 
conversation. Integra smiled at her slightly, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re 
wondering when I became a vampire?&quot;

        &quot;To be honest, yes,&quot; Ami admitted.

        &quot;Arucard did it,&quot; Integra explained, &quot;at my own request.&quot; She 
took a drink of something thick and red that Ami hoped was just wine, 
&quot;I don&#39;t think he was too surprised at my request to stay with 
Victoria.&quot;

        Victoria looked at Ami calmly, &quot;So why did you want to see 
me?&quot;

        To buy herself some time, Ami flagged down a waitress.

        &quot;Hi!&quot; Excel bounced up and down happily. She took Ami&#39;s order 
and was gone in a flash, returning in a few moments with the glass of 
brandy.

        &quot;I wanted to let you know about something,&quot; Ami took a 
cautious drink. &quot;I, along with a few other experts, have been doing 
research on vampirism, and the biological aspects of the change,&quot; she 
explained.

        &quot;And?&quot; Integra asked leadingly.

        Ami gave her a smile, &quot;We think we may be able to cure some of 
the disabilities that come with vampirism, including the light 
sensitivity.&quot;

        Integra raised an eyebrow, &quot;And the catch is?&quot;

        Ami gave her a respectful nod. &quot;The treatments are still 
experimental,&quot; she explained to them, &quot;and any possible side-effects 
are still unknown.&quot;

        Victoria didn&#39;t need very long to think about it before she 
answered, &quot;I can&#39;t speak for Integra, but for me the answer is no.&quot; A 
slight smile, &quot;I&#39;ve adapted to what I am, and I don&#39;t think that I 
would want to change it.&quot;

        Integra nodded, &quot;I would tend to agree.&quot;

        Ami smiled slightly, &quot;That&#39;s pretty much what I was 
expecting.&quot; She leaned back slightly, &quot;Are you planning to stay in 
Crystal Tokyo?&quot;

        The two vampires exchanged a silent glance and then Victoria 
answered her, &quot;For the near future, at least. Why?&quot;

        Ami quickly reassured them, &quot;The Queen is organizing a meeting 
up at the palace, officially it&#39;s a conference of the immortals.&quot; A 
grin, &quot;But I really think it&#39;s just a chance to get all our old 
friends together. I think she&#39;d love to see you there.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;d be honored,&quot; Integra smiled.

        Ami looked up, noticing a familiar face hovering at the edge 
of the dance floor. &quot;Looks like my lover has arrived,&quot; she chuckled, 
&quot;please excuse me.&quot; She left the table and walked towards her with a 
smile on her face.

        Rei Hino blushed slightly realizing she had been spotted, then 
moved forward to meet Ami. &quot;Sorry love,&quot; Rei murmured as she gently 
took Ami into her arms, &quot;I was getting a bit worried.&quot;

        &quot;My hero,&quot; Ami chuckled softly, as they began to sway together 
to the music. She looked up to meet her eyes, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;For what?&quot; Rei blinked.

        Softly Ami answered, &quot;For caring.&quot;

Characters in this Episode: Ami Mizuno and Rei Hino are from Sailor 
Moon. Cyber Six is from Cyber Six. Ruri is from Martian Successor 
Nadesico. Excel is from Excel Saga. Victoria Ceres and Integra 
Hellsing are from Hellsing.

Author&#39;s Note: the song that Victoria is singing is a bit more 
cheerful re- write of the song &quot;Rest in Peace,&quot; from Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer: Once More With Feeling! My deepest respects goes out to Joss 
Whedon, and I hope he doesn&#39;t mind too much what I did to his song...
