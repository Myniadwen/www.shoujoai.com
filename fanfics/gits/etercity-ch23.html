<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 23 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gits/index.html">Ghost in the Shell</a>

<a href="../gits/etercity-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>&quot;Do we know how badly hurt she was?&quot; Ami Mizuno asked,
running a hand through her short blue hair. She looked
nervous, this woman who dressed in the simple blue
slacks and blouse, standing there with her companion
on the landing platform.

Rei Hino shook her head, her mane of black hair
swirling. &quot;It was a strike fighter accident,&quot; she said
grimly, &quot;but other than that, Minako couldn&#39;t get much
from the Khanite.&quot; Her red dress was tight yet
comfortable, a color that had always suited her. She
scowled, &quot;We don&#39;t even have formal diplomatic
relations with them, yet.&quot;

&quot;We should have gone up to meet her on the station,&quot;
Ami fretted.

&quot;I hate to say this but I think Erica was right,&quot; Rei
said with a sigh, &quot;Ran probably would want a bit of
time before seeing us.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been nearly three years,&quot; Ami said softly, her
eyes dark with pain, &quot;how much more time away from us
does she need?&quot;

&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Rei admitted.

The slim combat shuttle came down smoothly, settling
onto the private landing pad with barely a thump. The
access hatch opened and the pilot descended, waiting
formally by the door for her passengers. Erica Tenoh
came out first, then Princess Usagi and Hotaru then
finally... Ran stepped out into the sunlight.

She moved with a slight limp and Ami fought the urge
to rush over to her daughter&#39;s side. Ran straightened
up, the leather clad woman pointedly ignoring her
injuries as she walked across the landing pad towards
them. As she neared the changes that the girl had gone
through gradually became more apparent, the muscle and
confidence that she had gained.

&quot;She looks good,&quot; Ami whispered.

&quot;That she does,&quot; Rei agreed, smiling wryly at the very
brief little leather outfit their daughter was
wearing. The military honors gleamed on the black, but
her eyes were drawn to the scars visible through holes
in the garb, still a fierce red.

Ran Mizuno walked up to them, standing there
hesitantly, then she offered her hand as she smiled at
them weakly and said, &quot;Mothers.&quot;

Ami reached out to take that hand then quickly drew
her surprised daughter into a quick hug. Careful not
to stress her wounds she hugged Ran close to her
before finally murmuring in her ear, &quot;I&#39;m glad that
you&#39;re home.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot; a fiercely blushing Ran protested once she got
free.

Rei offered the girl a smile, shaking her daughter&#39;s
hand. &quot;She was worried about you,&quot; she said to Ran
before adding, &quot;so was I.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Ran looked away uncomfortably.

&quot;We should get you down to the Palace clinic later,&quot;
Ami said, finally letting her eyes graze over the
scars that now marred Ran&#39;s slim body, &quot;accelerated
healing should be able to clear that up in a few
hours.&quot;

&quot;No, thanks,&quot; Ran shook her head firmly, &quot;not
interested.&quot; She surprised her mother with a slight
smile, &quot;I know I&#39;m a savage about these things, it&#39;s
just my way.&quot;

Erica moved over to Rei&#39;s side as Ami and Ran talked
intently, the whole group starting to move off of the
platform towards the Palace itself. &quot;You should know
that Ran said she isn&#39;t staying at the Palace,&quot; she
said to Rei softly.

Rei visibly winced. &quot;I could have guessed,&quot; she
admitted, looking over at her daughter with an
expression of longing.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Hotaru spoke up, her short black hair
ruffled by the breeze.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Rei shrugged. A ghost of a smile
flickered across her lips, &quot;Did you and Ran end up
fighting again?&quot;

Hotaru actually blushed faintly. &quot;Just like always,&quot;
she admitted.

&quot;Erica managed to break that up pretty quickly,&quot; Usagi
offered with a cheery smile, her long pink hair
flowing down her back in twin streams.

&quot;Tuxedo Erica strikes again?&quot; Rei asked with a smile.

Erica blushed, &quot;Something like that.&quot;

Ami nodded to the young man dressed in a blue hardsuit
standing by the door, part of the Palace&#39;s exterior
guard. &quot;Wonder if any of my old buddies are still in
the Hardsuit corps?&quot; Ran said to herself thoughtfully.

&quot;It&#39;s certainly possible,&quot; Ami admitted. They walked
down the hallway in silence a moment, then Ami asked,
&quot;Did you need any help in finding a hotel to stay in?&quot;

Ran looked down at her mother in surprise, &quot;I almost
thought you were going to try and offer me my old
room.&quot;

Ami laughed, but it wasn&#39;t a terribly pleasant sound.
&quot;I&#39;m not quite that foolish, Ran,&quot; she said as they
reached the lift, pausing to let the others to catch
up.

&quot;So how many of the other Senshi are here in the
palace?&quot; Ran asked.

&quot;Minako and Makoto are both in residence again,&quot; Rei
said, frowning slightly as she felt the tension
between Ami and Ran. She gave Ran a questioning look,
but the girl merely answered her with stony silence.

&quot;Knowing Minako she&#39;s informed everyone you&#39;re
arriving today,&quot; Hotaru quietly noted, &quot;so you&#39;d
better prepare yourself.&quot;

&quot;And the Queen and King of course,&quot; Ran murmured. &quot;I
wonder if I could slip out of the palace without
anyone noticing?&quot; she half joked.

Usagi looked at Ran in surprise, &quot;You really don&#39;t
want to see them?&quot;

&quot;Yes and no,&quot; Ran shrugged uncomfortably, &quot;I like
them, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it was such a mess when
I left home....&quot;

&quot;A mess of your own making,&quot; Hotaru commented dryly.

A muscle jumped in Ran&#39;s jaw as she tightly clenched
it. &quot;I don&#39;t need this,&quot; she said with a scowl,
reaching out for the panel to stop the lift.

&quot;Hotaru, you said you&#39;d behave!&quot; Usagi cried.

Erica gently put her hand on Ran&#39;s, stopping her for a
moment. &quot;Don&#39;t let your temper get the best of you,&quot;
she murmured softly, &quot;this is a second chance. Don&#39;t
waste it.&quot;

Ran felt her mothers&#39; eyes on her, then slowly drew
her hand away from the switch. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she
nodded to Erica as a sigh of relief filled the small
compartment.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Hotaru sighed as they reached their
floor, &quot;that was a cheap shot.&quot;

&quot;Yes it was,&quot; Ran met her eyes, something dangerous
flashing between them as she coldly continued, &quot;and I
won&#39;t forget it.&quot; Hotaru blinked in surprise, clearly
expecting a polite accepting of the apology, not that
sort of challenge.

&quot;Marvelous,&quot; Rei sighed softly, &quot;could we please get
going? I think the Queen and the others would like to
see us eventually.&quot;

Hotaru turned away with a scowl and strode off, the
rest of them following down the hall after her. &quot;You
do know what Saturn is capable of, right?&quot; Erica
hissed to Ran softly, &quot;Are you sure you want to be
picking a fight with her?&quot;

&quot;Never say give up, never again,&quot; Ran quoted one of
her favorite singers with a smile, watching as Usagi
reached Hotaru&#39;s side. Obviously she was scolding
Hotaru from the look on the other girl&#39;s face. More
seriously she continued, &quot;And I&#39;m not quite the same
girl I was when I left three years ago, you know.&quot;

Ami and Rei walked together, watching their child and
the others thoughtfully. &quot;You know,&quot; Ami finally
murmured, &quot;I think Ran takes after you.&quot;

&quot;God, I hope not,&quot; Rei said with a sigh, &quot;I remember
more than one time that my stubbornness got me into
trouble.&quot; She reached out to take Aim&#39;s hand in hers,
squeezing it gently as she added, &quot;Do you think we can
fix things between us?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m hopeful.&quot;

Rei smirked as a thought occurred to her, &quot;You know, I
think I know why she&#39;s so bad tempered. Maybe she
needs to get laid?&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Ami scolded.

&quot;Mom!&quot; Ran protested, having overheard.
