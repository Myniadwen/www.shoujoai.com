<a href="../gits/etercity-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>&quot;Don&#39;t be too angry with her,&quot; Catrine said softly
later as Erica picked her up at the gates of the
training center, &quot;it was my idea.&quot; The blue haired
girl had changed out of her hardsuit underclothes to
standard street wear, a simple set of pants and top,
the blue of her hair shining in the sunlight.

Erica Tenoh smiled back, her black hair falling into
her eyes, &quot;I think I&#39;ve calmed down now.&quot; After a
fairly stiff meeting with the three pilots Tuxedo
Kamen had ducked out, finding a quiet place to revert
to her other form and then returned here.

&quot;Does that mean you forgive Ran?&quot; Catrine asked as
they set out together.

&quot;No. But I&#39;ll punish her later,&quot; Erica joked.

&quot;Erica,&quot; Catrine lightly punched her in the shoulder.
&quot;If you had known it was me in the hardsuit, would you
have gone all out?&quot;

Erica sighed, thinking about it as they walked along
one of the busy streets. &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; she
conceded after a moment.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Catrine took her arm, standing close to
her.

&quot;Remind me not to annoy you, by the way,&quot; Erica
flashed a grin as she said, &quot;you&#39;re positively
dangerous in a hardsuit.&quot;

Catrine blushed with pleasure even as she said, &quot;Well,
we did out number you.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;I bet
you could beat any one of us.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Erica conceded.

Back at the base Ran Mizuno puffed out a sigh of
relief. &#39;I really thought Erica was going to lose it a
minute there.&#39; she mused, the blue haired pilot
leaving her office in a simple black flight suit.

&quot;Hey Ran,&quot; Kyo Yamada called, the black haired young
man nodding to her politely.

&quot;Kyo,&quot; Ran nodded her greetings even as she flashed
him a warmer than usual smile. &quot;Could you do me a
favor?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Kyo asked her a bit warily.

&quot;Nothing too dire,&quot; Ran reassures him, &quot;I just want
you to o over the combat data of Tuxedo Kamen versus
three of our hardsuits.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho,&quot; Kyo grinned, whipping out a set of glasses
and putting them on. Eagerly he asked, &quot;How did they
do?&quot;

&quot;Three against one,&quot; Ran sounded annoyed, &quot;and Tuxedo
Kamen still nearly won.&quot;

Kyo gave her a odd look, &quot;You&#39;re not happy your friend
nearly won?&quot;

Ran rolled her eyes, &quot;I expected to have to call the
fight off, not to see Tuxedo Kamen hold her own until
they managed to pin her down.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Kyo acknowledged. &quot;Trainer suits, or military
models?&quot;

&quot;I told her they were trainer suits, but I lied,&quot; Ran
confessed, &quot;they were full on military models with
stun charges rather than active guns.&quot;

Kyo whistled softly, &quot;Damn.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ran nodded, &quot;and just think, she&#39;s only been
active a few months. Imagine how good she&#39;ll be in a
few years?&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should get a few of our real aces to
practice against her?&quot; Kyo mused thoughtfully, a
dangerous twinkle in his eyes.

Ran grinned back, &quot;Might be something to think about.&quot;
They reached the combat analysis room as she added,
&quot;Once we&#39;re done going over the data, I&#39;ve been asked
to send a copy to Major Motoko Kusanagi.&quot;

Kyo raised a surprised eyebrow, &quot;What does
intelligence want with that data?&quot;

&quot;I assume it&#39;s the Sailor Senshi connection that
interests them,&quot; Ran said mildly.

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll help you out, but I expect a favor in
return,&quot; Kyo said with a sly smile on his handsome
face.

&quot;And what would that be?&quot; Ran asked as the entered the
room, holographic imaging systems and data crystal
matrixes sitting about.

&quot;Dinner tonight?&quot; Kyo asked mildly.

Ran looked up at him, faintly surprised then smiled
slightly. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t have anything planned,&quot; she
admitted, &quot;so why not? Yes, we&#39;ll do dinner.&quot;

Not much later on and up at the palace, Major Motoko
Kusanagi strode down the hall, her uniform hugging her
shapely form. Entering the outer office of Lady Venus
she nodded to the receptionist, &quot;Hello Nuku Nuku.&quot;

Nuku Nuku beamed up at her cheerfully, her wild mane
of red hair flowing around her. &quot;Hello Major,&quot; she
said, &quot;Lady Venus said for you to head right in.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Motoko said, hiding a smile as she headed
by. If she had wanted to she could have snuck in to
maintain the separation between Minako&#39;s diplomatic
and intelligence roles, but now that she and Minako
were in a formal relationship, it provided a good
reason for her to pay a visit.

Minako looked up from her desk, her blonde hair
shining in the sunlight coming through a nearby
window. &quot;That had better not be more bad news,&quot; she
growled, narrowing her blue eyes with annoyance.

&quot;Jun?&quot; Motoko guessed as she walked over to her lover
and hugged her gently.

&quot;Alcard jumped the gun and decided to pay her a
visit,&quot; Minako revealed glumly as she huddled a moment
in the safety of Motoko&#39;s arms, &quot;she transformed and
bodily threw him out of her apartment.&quot;

Motoko frowned, &quot;Alcard didn&#39;t try to kill her
afterward, did he? I&#39;d hate to arrest him, considering
his abilities.&quot;

Minako pulled away as she softly conceded, &quot;Actually,
Alcard showed remarkable restraint.&quot; A frown appeared
on her face, &quot;He said he could sympathize with her,
having been used so often himself.&quot;

Motoko scowled, &quot;Remind me to thrash that vampire.&quot;

&quot;No, he&#39;s got a point,&quot; Minako said quietly. She
walked back towards her desk as she said, &quot;I should
have taken into account that Jun was manipulated by
Asuka Ran and how badly she might react to anyone else
trying it.&quot;

After a moment Motoko asked, &quot;Are we writing her off
as a agent, then?&quot;

&quot;No, not yet,&quot; Minako said. She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m
seriously considering going out to see her with you as
my bodyguard.&quot;

&quot;With another agent, too,&quot; Motoko added, thinking
about how powerful Jun&#39;s Devilman Lady form could be.

&quot;Any suggestions?&quot; Minako smiled teasingly.

&quot;Actually...&quot; Motoko removed a data file from her
jacket and passed it over.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Minako plugged the crystal into a reader on her
desk and quickly scanned the data. &quot;This can&#39;t be
right,&quot; she looked up in surprise.

&quot;I double checked the data myself,&quot; Motoko said with a
half smile, &quot;our new Tuxedo Kamen is actually faster
than any of the Sailor Senshi when they first started
out.&quot;

&quot;Too bad I can&#39;t formally recruit her,&quot; Minako
murmured after a moment.

&quot;There&#39;s a rule saying senshi can&#39;t work for the
crown?&quot; Motoko guessed.

&quot;No,&quot; Minako shook her head, &quot;but her parents would
kill me.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Motoko nodded, &quot;good point.&quot;</pre>
