<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 29 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gits/index.html">Ghost in the Shell</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gits/etercity-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>Jun Fudoh walked away briskly, her long black hair
flowing around her as she weaved through the crowd,
glad that these people respected privacy. It was
obvious that people in the crowd recognized her, but
the customs of Crystal Tokyo kept people from
bothering her too much. Of course privacy was a double
edged sword.. in the weeks since she had arrived here
Jun still lived in seclusion, it was just in a
beautiful suite. She could still hear the disturbance
behind her but she walked on, anger giving her a much
needed spring to her step.

&quot;Fudoh-san,&quot; the young woman worked to catch up, the
slightly shorter women having a harder time keeping
up, her business woman&#39;s garb hugging her slim form.

Jun relented enough to let the other woman catch up
with her, but the elegantly dressed woman&#39;s expression
was stony. &quot;You can tell your vid person that I&#39;m not
interested,&quot; she said in clipped tones, her scarlet
eyes narrowed in anger.

&quot;I&#39;m truly sorry,&quot; she executed a half bow, &quot;I didn&#39;t
know that he was going to suggest that you pose for
nude shots, ma&#39;am.&quot;

A muscle in Jun&#39;s jaw jumped with restrained
irritation. &quot;I never did those sort of shots when I
first was a model,&quot; she answered the girl&#39;s unspoken
question, &quot;I certainly have no intention of doing so
now, Kinomoto-san.&quot;

&quot;Call me Nadesico,&quot; she smiled, her red hair falling
into her eyes, &quot;I regret how this has gone,
considering you did this as a favor to your old
agency.&quot;

&quot;You also happen to be very persuasive,&quot; Jun noted.
Miss Kinomoto had pursued her relentlessly if politely
after she found out Jun was in the city, trying to get
the still famous idol to sign with her agency and
resume her modeling career.

Nadesico politely maneuvered her towards a nearby
cafe, &quot;Would you mind?&quot;

Jun frowned but ultimately agreed, the two of the
entering and quickly being given a private seat.
Coffee was soon delivered and Jun sipped at her cup,
covertly studying Nadesico over the edge of her cup.
The little redhead had a odd energy, coupled with a
focus that could be very impressive. Her parents were
famous too, Sakura and Tomoyo Kinomoto, giving her
some degree of empathy with her many clients.

Nadesico nibbled on a biscuit, obviously considering
what to say. &quot;Would you consider returning to the
shoot if I spell out to the photographer what limits
he must operate under?&quot; she finally asked Jun
tentatively.

&quot;I doubt he would be content with that,&quot; Jun answered,
feeling another flash of anger, &quot;and I didn&#39;t care for
his manner, in all honesty.&quot; The man had treated her
like a piece of meat, instructing her in clipped tones
what to do... she had obeyed at first, her anger
rising, but when he commanded her to strip she just
walked out.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Nadesico asked, looking at Jun with
concern.

Jun quietly spelled out her encounter with the man,
observing the odd look that was quickly appearing on
the pretty young lady&#39;s face. Finally she just had to
ask the younger woman, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I...,&quot; Nadesico shook her head, eyes flashing, &quot;I&#39;m
truly sorry, Fudoh-san, I didn&#39;t realize.&quot; Her eyes
glittered with anger, &quot;He was badly out of line.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Jun said dryly before grimly adding, &quot;I
was a bit worried that was how the business worked
now.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Nadesico shook her head, &quot;the
photographer in question is quite prominent, and used
to getting his way.&quot; Her lips thinned to a angry line
as she added, &quot;Obviously he forgot who he was dealing
with.&quot;

&quot;I remember the type,&quot; Jun noted, &quot;thankfully I don&#39;t
plan on doing this again.&quot;

That comment left Nadesico subdued, the younger woman
looking down at her sack uncomfortably. &quot;I hope you
might reconsider that,&quot; she finally said, &quot;you are
might admired in this era, Fudoh-san.&quot;

&quot;For reason&#39;s I&#39;m not terribly proud of,&quot; Jun bit out.

&quot;Because of the Devilman?&quot; Nadesico said softly,
looking at her sympathetically.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Jun nodded uncomfortably.

Nadesico hesitated, then reached out to put her hand
on Jun&#39;s. &quot;You may not believe it,&quot; she met Jun&#39;s
eyes, &quot;but you are as well known for your modeling and
appearances than your many battles during the beast
progress.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; Jun&#39;s voice came out choked with some
unidentified emotion. She surprised Nadesico by nearly
jumping from the table and rushing from the cafe.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Nadesico blurted, tossing a few credit markers
on the table before running outside after her. Looking
around wildly she saw Jun hurrying down the street and
went after her, calling out, &quot;Fudoh-san!&quot;

Jun shrugged off Nadesico&#39;s hand on her arm, glaring
down at the smaller woman, &quot;I never should have agreed
to this, it was foolish.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t lying Jun,&quot; Nadesico said softly, &quot;I, like
many others, admire you a great deal.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Jun answered, her eyes glowing
bloody red as she barked, &quot;I am a monster, damn it!&quot;

Jun tensed, and then on the sun drenched street began
to change. Her body swelled, fur rapidly growing even
as her fine clothes tore, shredding to fall away from
her muscular form. Her hair swept up into twin wings,
her form stretching to nearly a foot taller than she
had been, towering over the awed Nadesico and the
shocked onlookers.

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; Nadesico murmured.

Not listening, a little panicked by her anger spawned
transformation, Devilman Lady cried out her rage to
the skies. In a single shift massive, batlike wings
stretched from her back, throwing the transformed Jun
into the sky and away from everyone.

&quot;This is all my fault,&quot; Nadesico said, reaching into
her simple jacket. The card shimmered, edged in gold
and designed with complex patterns, and flared
brightly as she raised it above her head and called
out, &quot;Fly!&quot;

Far above the city Devilman Lady scanned the ground,
debating where to go. She hadn&#39;t planned, instinct
carrying her away from what had caused her pain, and
now she wasn&#39;t sure exactly what to do. Beats of her
great leathery wings held her there in the air, the
surprisingly clean air flowing by her.

&quot;Fudoh-san?&quot; the quiet voice asked, &quot;Jun?&quot;

Devilman Lady spun, lips curling back in a snarl...
only to blink in surprise. Nadesico hovered there in
midair, held there by wings of purest white. With some
difficulty she managed to get out, &quot;How...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Nadesico answered. With a gentle
smile she appealed, &quot;Please, Fudoh-san, can we talk?&quot;

They hovered there a moment, then Devilman Lady nodded
just slightly. Leading the way she descended to a
rooftop, landing gracefully on the gleaming crystal
spire. Calm again she began to change, shrinking to
return to her human form.

Kneeling there naked Jun looked up at Nadesico, her
black framing a lovely face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she managed
softly, &quot;it seems that I&#39;m not as ready to deal with
people as I thought I was.&quot;

Nadesico let the wings dissolve to light and return to
it&#39;s card form even as she took her coat off, offering
it to Jun to try to preserve some of the other woman&#39;s
dignity. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be sorry for, I&#39;m the one
who should be apologizing,&quot; she answered. &#39;She&#39;s lived
along for who knows how long,&#39; Nadesico thought
angrily, &#39;and here I am wanting to make her famous
again? No wonder she got angry.&#39;

Jun&#39;s lips twitched, almost as if she would smile.
&quot;Then maybe we should both apologize,&quot; she said, &quot;and
then let it go.&quot;

Nadesico nodded, looking at Jun with clear sympathy.
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have pushed you to try this, Fudoh-san,&quot;
she said softly, &quot;I regret that I have hurt you or
caused you distress.&quot;

&quot;Not something I&#39;m used to,&quot; Jun murmured
thoughtfully. She walked to the edge of the roof and
looked down at the street far below, then looked
questioningly at Nadesico, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could
give me a lift?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Nadesico invoked the Fly Card again,
feeling sad that this probably was going to be a
farewell.

&quot;I have no intention of being in another photo shook,&quot;
Jun said firmly. She hesitated, &quot;But... I wouldn&#39;t
mind hearing how you got these wings, Nadesico.&quot; A
flash of a smile, &quot;It might help me get used to
dealing with people, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Nadesico smiled happily.

To be continued....

Notes: Nadesico is, of course, the daughter of Sakura
and Tomoyo from Cardcaptor Sakura. The cards she uses
are probably magically created replicas of the Clow
cards, not the originals. Jun is of course Devilman
Lady, and this is the third chapter I&#39;ve written on
her so far.</pre>
