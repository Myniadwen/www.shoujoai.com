<h1>Something More (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gatekeep/index.html">Gatekeepers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gatekeep/sumore-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ayane Isuzu quietly left the office building, slinging her computer case 
over her shoulder, the long brown coat that she usually wore blowing in 
the breeze. She stopped and stood there outside for a moment to look it 
over, studying the familiar structure.

It appeared much the same as when she first saw it years ago, despite 
being nearly destroyed by Ghost Girl a few months ago. In the aftermath 
of the activation of the Gate of Restoration it had all been perfectly 
restored but still... it felt a bit odd. It was exactly the same, they 
knew that, but they remembered the destruction that had been unleashed 
here.

&#39;I guess it&#39;s the rest of us that have changed,&#39; Ayane mused, &#39;in so 
many ways.&#39; She shook her head and laughed softly as she said aloud, 
&quot;And I&#39;m wasting time.&quot; With that she walked for awhile until she went 
into a store, taking a moment to pick something out.

&quot;You&#39;re Miu&#39;s friend, aren&#39;t you?&quot; the woman behind the counter noted.

Ayane blinked at her in shock then realized that her steps hjad taken 
her to the shop Miu had worked for a while. &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Ayane found 
herself answering.

She gave Ayane a piercing look. &quot;Miu was very upset after you came by,&quot; 
she said thoughtfully, &quot;did you two make up?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Ayane nodded, feeling herself blushing with pure embarassment. 
She had been a jerk, delivering cutting words to Miu here with the other 
girl unable to even respond. Ayane was just lucky that Miu had a 
forgiving nature.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; the woman smiled as she rang up the purchase, &quot;from how 
often Miu talked about you I think you two would make a lovely couple.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not,&quot; Ayane stammered, &quot;I mean I&#39;ve never...&quot;

She just chuckled warmly, putting Ayane&#39;s purchase into a carry box. 
&quot;Have a nice day,&quot; she waved cheerfully as Ayane left.

Walking out with a small cake Ayane headed over to the bus stop, waiting 
a few moments before climbing aboard. The ride across the city was long, 
Ayane gazing out at all the people and buildings as she tried very hard 
not to think about what she was going to do.

Ayane rang the bell when she hit the right neighborhood, climbing off 
the bus as she looked around at the tightly packed houses. She knew the 
address despite never having visited, her on-line research on her fellow 
gatekeeper having been quite extensive. Ayane walked to the door and 
took a deep breath before ringing the doorbell.

&quot;Coming,&quot; the unfamiliar voice called then a few seconds later the door 
opened. The woman who was standing there had a thoughtful look on her 
face and bore a remarkable resemblance to Miu. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked Ayane 
curiously.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Ayane gulped, instantly knowing this was Miu&#39;s mother. &quot;My name 
is Isuzu Ayane,&quot; she introduced herself with a bow, &quot;I&#39;m a classmate of 
Miu&#39;s. Is she home?&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re Isuzu-san,&quot; Miu&#39;s mother smiled slightly as she stepped aside 
yo let her in, &quot;my daughter talks about you all the time.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Ayane gulped.

&quot;Miu,&quot; her mother called out cheerfully, &quot;your friend is here!&quot;

&quot;Coming,&quot; Miu&#39;s voice lead her descent down the stairs, the taller 
girl&#39;s serious expression breaking into a smile as she saw their guest, 
&quot;Isuzu-san!&quot; With that she slipped, falling forward with a windmilling 
of arms, &quot;Eeep!&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ayane rushed to her side.

Miu sniffled, a few tears in her eyes as she said sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Izusu-san.&quot;

&quot;She always calls you that?&quot; Miu&#39;s mother murmured, having walked over 
to their side. She helped her daughter up with the ease of long 
practice, her smile fond of her clumsy daughter.

&quot;I&#39;m getting used to it,&quot; Ayane answered her softly. With a tentative 
smile she held up the box in offering, &quot;I come bearing cake.&quot;

&quot;You two go on upstairs,&quot; Miu&#39;s mother smiled as she waved them on 
towards the stairs, &quot;I&#39;ve got some cleaning to do.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Miu took Ayane&#39;s hand in hers, gently drawing her friend up 
the stairs. She blushed a bit as she pushed her door open, &quot;It&#39;s a bit 
messy.&quot;

In fact the bedroom they entered was remarkably neat, a little desk 
covered with books and a neatly made bed nearby. The walls were 
decorated with fantasy posters and the occasional starlet, oddly there 
were no male idols up on display. Novels filled up a older bookcase, a 
small TV sitting nearby with a few DVDs to go along with it.

&quot;It looks nice,&quot; Ayane smiled, setting the cake box down on top of the 
desk. She fidgeted under Miu&#39;s warm gaze, wondering what she was 
thinking of, coming here. &#39;How can I tell her what I want to?&#39; she 
thought.

&quot;Sit,&quot; Miu sat down on the bed, patting the cover beside her.

Ayane gulped softly, sitting down beside her friend as she felt her 
cheeks color slightly. It was nice, feeling the gentle warmth that 
radiated from Miu, the unique sensation that the other girl brought out 
in her. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind my just showing up,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;I&#39;ve invited you here before,&quot; Miu reached out to casually put her hand 
over Ayane&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;m just glad that you decided to come by, Isuzu-san.&quot;

Ayane closed her eyes tightly for a moment, just enjoying the feeling of 
Miu&#39;s hand resting on hers. &quot;There was something that I wanted to talk 
to you about,&quot; she said to her quietly, &quot;away from our school work and 
AEGIS.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Miu looked down at her warmly, the gaze from the other girl so 
gentle and kind, so different from Ayane&#39;s.

Ayane took a deep breath and blurted out the words that she had wanted 
to say for weeks or maybe even months, &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Miu said warmly.

&quot;I know this is a shock,&quot; Ayane continued on, obviously not having 
heard, &quot;but....&quot; She stopped, finally registering what Miu had just 
said, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I love you,&quot; Miu squeezed Ayane&#39;s hands gently in hers as she 
continued, &quot;I have for a long time.&quot; Her eyes went grave, &quot;I liked you 
almost as soon as we met, but then we fought and I didn&#39;t think you 
liked me anymore.&quot;

Ayane winced at that memory. Once Miu had understood that the Invaders 
were once fully human she had been shocked, and Ayane hadn&#39;t helped. 
Ayane&#39;s own words had driven Miu away, both of them suffering at the 
parting.

Miu reached out, gently tilting Ayane&#39;s face up so they could look into 
each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;Now that we were friends again I didn&#39;t want to lose 
that,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I thought that I might drive you away by....&quot;

&quot;I was terrified coming here,&quot; Ayane admitted, smiling warmly up at her. 
With a courage she slid her hands up, taking Miu by the shoulders and 
drawing her down gently. Miu closed her eyes, her lips pursed then they 
kissed gently.

Miu sighed happily, her cheeks red. &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that so long,&quot; 
she admitted.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Ayane pulled her into another kiss.

End.

Author&#39;s Notes: The ending for Gatekeepers 21 shows Ayane beginning to 
become a warmer person as well as the friendship growing between her and 
Miu. The six episodes deal with the ups and downs of their relationship, 
including possibly a romantic aspect, but there is no real resolution to 
it. So I decided to write something after the series to tie that aspect 
up. There are some assumptions in here about the characters&#39; 
backgrounds, but not much detail is actually included in the anime 
itself. I&#39;m using name spellings from a GK 21 website, compared with 
subtitles in the anime. If there&#39;s a problem, let me know and I&#39;ll 
correct it.</pre>
