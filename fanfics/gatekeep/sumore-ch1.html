<h1>Something More (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gatekeep/index.html">Gatekeepers</a>

<pre>&quot;Gate Open!&quot; Satoke cried, the red streak in her black hair falling into 
her eyes. She plunged her hand into the shining disk of crimson light 
and drew out a sword, the massive weapon shining. Satoke charged 
forward, ignoring the Invader&#39;s attacks as she lashed out ruthlessly.

&quot;Should we...?&quot; Miu Manazaru asked nervously, the brown haired girl 
looking worriedly towards their comrade.

&quot;No,&quot; Ayane Isuzu shook her head, glasses catching the light, &quot;there&#39;s 
more coming.&quot;

The first Invader appeared suddenly, erupting from the human shell that 
he wore to stand revealed before them, then dozens more materialized 
right beside him. The pitch black clothing, badly scarred gray skin and 
black sunglasses were all exactly the same, the ranks of them looking 
like perfect copies of one another.

&quot;Just lower level entities again,&quot; Ayane Isuzu murmured, the black 
haired girl pushing her round glasses up, &quot;but I guess we&#39;ll just have 
to manage.&quot;

The brown haired girl beside her had a warm smile on her face, nearly 
standing a foot taller than Ayane. &quot;Hai, Isuzu-san,&quot; Miu Manazuru 
agreed.

&quot;Let&#39;s do it like we planned,&quot; Ayane flashed Miu a confident smile that 
was just a bit warmer than what was normal for her.

The Invaders&#39; bodies shifted, long black coats opening up to reveal 
conduits and cables that reshaped into large guns that were pointed 
right at the two schoolgirls standing before them. Ayane&#39;s coat 
fluttered out and open, revealing the cellphones that lined it and she 
swiftly pulled two out, her fingers already tapping in the right codes.

&quot;Gate open!&quot; Miu cried, a swirling disc of rings appearing beneath her 
before she was thrown up into the air by her Gate of Flight.

Ayane tossed her cellphones confidently, flinging them down right in 
front of the Invaders path even as Miu dropped her own two just behind 
the large force. She flipped her laptop open, Ayane&#39;s finger lingering 
over the &#39;enter&#39; key before pressing it.

&quot;Gate open,&quot; Ayane murmured.

The four phones exploded to life, opening up Gates of Fire at every side 
of the Invader force. They were all gone in a few moments, scoured clean 
in the wash of purifying flame, leaving only the shining crystals 
scattered on the ground. It was suddenly eerily silent around the 
street, almost as if the world had been shocked silent by the sudden 
conclusion to the battle. Only Ayane and Miu remained amoungst the 
shadows, taking stock of the battle.

&quot;Guess we&#39;d better start collecting the crystals,&quot; Ayane murmured as she 
walked forward, &quot;looks like a good haul.&quot;

&quot;Look out!&quot; Miu cried out in alarm.

The surviving Invader emerged from the shadows, reaching out for Ayane 
with half of it&#39;s body destroyed by the flames. Suddenly Miu dropped 
down out of the sky right on it, hammering her two feet on top of it&#39;s 
head as her gate flared to life.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ayane rushed to Miu&#39;s side where the girl had 
fallen on her butt, the Invader&#39;s crystal gleaming beside her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Miu smiled up at her from the ground as she cheerfully explained, 
&quot;I reversed the thrust of my gate to push me right down on him.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ayane&#39;s lips twitched up in another smile as she offered the 
girl her hand. Miu took it, Ayane tugging her back to her feet before 
she lost her balance.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Miu squeaked, stumbled and fell forward, she and Ayane both 
thumping down to the street together in a tangle of limbs.

The taller girl lay sprawled above Ayane, looking into each other&#39;s eyes 
as their sweetly scented breath lightly blew across each other&#39;s faces. 
&#39;She&#39;s got the most lovely eyes,&#39; Ayane found herself thinking dazedly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Miu blushed fiercely, scrambling to her feet.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Ayane got up, the blushing girl pushing her round 
glasses up on her face.

&quot;You two done?&quot; Satoke walked up to ask, her girl&#39;s yniform a bit torn 
but otherwise unscathed by her berzerker attack.

Ayane bit back a sarcastic remark, &quot;We&#39;re fine.&quot; She puffed a breath 
out, &quot;We&#39;d better get going or we&#39;ll never get to all our jobs tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Isuzu-san,&quot; Miu beamed as she fell into place beside her.

&quot;You can call me Ayane, you know,&quot; she reminded Miu as they walked down 
the silent street together, the smaller girl clearly in control once 
again..

&quot;But Isuzu-san...&quot; Miu protested and Ayane sighed softly.

&quot;You know, when I said I was looking for something more interesting to 
do,&quot; an amused looking Ayane commented as she looked out the window at 
the city far below them, &quot;I wasn&#39;t really expecting something like 
this.&quot;

&quot;I supose that&#39;s true,&quot; the older man walked over to the coffee table 
and set out the two cups of tea, a slightly amused smile on his face.

Reiji Kagayame moved around smoothly despite all of his implants and 
cybernetics, the dreadful cost that he had paid for using his own 
gatekeeper ability. The black suit and gloves that he usually wore 
almost made him look like an Invader as well, but his flashes of warmth 
and honest humor quickly dispelled that impression.

&quot;What&#39;s the Invader situation right now?&quot; Ayane asked, gazing out at the 
busy city below them. Cars honked, trains ran, the sort of noise and 
clatter that had once annoyed her so greatly, but now... it seemed 
simply the pulse of the living city, a oddly sweet sound.

&quot;Constant or even a bit in decline,&quot; Reiji answered simply, &quot;and don&#39;t 
change the subject.&quot; He smiled, &quot;We were talking about you.&quot;

&quot;So what do I do now?&quot; Ayane asked with a sigh as she left the view 
behind and walked over to join him, sitting down on the couch across 
from his own seat.

&quot;I&#39;m not exactly the best person to ask for romantic advice,&quot; Reiji had 
to admit, his almost gray hair falling down in front of his gleaming 
sunglasses. &quot;Have you thought about talking to either Satoke or Yukino?&quot; 
he offered hopefully.

&quot;I like Yukino,&quot; Ayane admitted as she thought of the ghostly gatekeeper 
of ice, &quot;but advice in the form of obscure poetry isn&#39;t too helpful.&quot;

&quot;And Satoke?&quot; Reiji asked, referring to the gatekeeper of blades. The 
black haired girl was quite bold with her red streaked hair and 
attitude, looking like someone out of some school gang picture, but she 
was a powerful friend and ally.

&quot;I think she&#39;s still a little too focused on being my rival for the best 
Invader hunter,&quot; Ayane said with a wry smile. There was a warmth in her 
face and gentleness in her eyes as she spoke about her fellow 
gatekeepers, one that offset any possible criticism.

&#39;She certainly has changed a great deal,&#39; Reiji thought with a fatherly 
smile. When he had first met Ayane she had been a quietly intense girl 
with no friends and apparently no need for them. When they first 
recruited Miu she had resented the other girl, but with the Ghost Girl 
incident and after she had opened up a great deal.

&quot;And I can&#39;t really go to Miu about it,&quot; Ayane said uncomfortably.

&quot;Because she&#39;s the one you care for,&quot; Reiji noted.

Ayane sat up straight, nearly spitting out her mouthful of tea. &quot;Yes,&quot; 
she said, recovering her poise pretty quickly, &quot;but how did you know?&quot;

Reiji flashed her a smile, &quot;Credit me with some perception, please.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not just that I care for her,&quot; Ayane admitted, the younger woman&#39;s 
cheeks going red, &quot;I think I&#39;m in love with Miu.&quot;

With someone else he might have suggested that she might be 
exaggerating, but Reiji knew Ayane far too well. If she said something 
like that, she probably meant it. &quot;Have you told her about how you 
feel?&quot; he asked.

Ayane gave him a scornful look. &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; she asked him with a 
sigh. She drank more tea, the light catching the beads on her hair tie, 
&quot;I&#39;m too afraid.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s clear that she cares for you a great deal,&quot; Reiji said. He 
hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should mention it then quietly 
said, &quot;When you were in a coma she was in here visiting you every day, 
no matter what.&quot;

&quot;I knew,&quot; Ayane said quietly, swirling the last of her tea around in the 
cup, &quot;I was aware of it, even if I couldn&#39;t respond.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fair to say that she has feelings for you,&quot; Reiji said, &quot;it only 
remains for you to try and discover the depth of those feelings.&quot;

Ayane nodded thoughtfully, &quot;I think you&#39;re right.&quot; She got up, the 
little bell hanging from her backpack jingling as she picked it up, &quot;Do 
you need Miu and I to go on patrol tonight?&quot;

&quot;Satoke can handle things,&quot; Reiji said firmly, &quot;and Yukino and I are 
available if something should go badly wrong.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ayane smiled.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Reiji called out, &quot;and don&#39;t be out too late.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start sounding like my father,&quot; Ayane waved back to him casually 
as she left the suite, &quot;or I&#39;ll never forgive you.&quot;
