<h1>Love is Like a Bullet to the Heart</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../najica/index.html">Najica Blitz Tactics</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There were moments when expert perfumer Najica Hiragi knew a certain 
degree of peace. Working in her lab as her assistant opened scent 
samples, carefully sniffing each one as she narrowed down the 
possibilities had a certain kind of tranquility to it. Similarly on the 
firing range as she aimed and fired her pistol, the scent of gunpowder 
wafting by her nose brought peace to her heart. But sadly the peace 
never lasted, leaving Najica looking for the next hit, the next moment 
of calm in the eye of the storm.

Lila paused as the purple haired android watched Najica stride to the 
door of the apartment they shared. &quot;Najica,&quot; she said in her soft voice, 
&quot;is there a mission?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Najica&#39;s sandy blonde hair fell down over her collar, her usual 
mini-skirt clinging tightly to her hips, &quot;I&#39;m just going out for a bit. 
Watch the house for me.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Lila agreed.

Najica&#39;s boots clicked on the pavement as she walked out to the car, 
popping open the door as she climbed in. The engine of her little sports 
car revved to life like some hungry cat, and with a smile Najica patted 
the dashboard. With a squeal of tires she tore off down the road, 
luxuriating in the wind in her hair and the cool breeze of the night 
winds.

Sometimes, Najica wondered what the Earth had been like before the 
climate changed. She knew from studying history that the world had once 
been much cooler, but it was all abstract data to her. She found it 
difficult to imagine a world where women wore longer skirts or pants and 
men wore heavy weight suits and other clothes, it was all 
incomprehensible.

The Tokyo hotel was one that Najica had used before: it was a well 
maintained place with a reputation for being very discrete. Many people 
for many compoanies went there but the staff and owners never talked 
about what went on or who might have left with was the perfect place to 
meet for both business and pleasure, depending on what it was you were 
looking for that night.

Najica pulled into the garage, letting the young man direct her to 
parking rather than letting a staff member park her car. She got out 
gracefully, nodding to the parking manager as she slipped him a twenty, 
&quot;Keep a eye on my car, please.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; the redheaded boy nodded, freckles dotting his wholesome 
face, &quot;and thank you.&quot;

Najica smiled, amused by the boy&#39;s raw newness as she said gravely, 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; She knew that life would soon wear much of that 
innocence away, and felt a odd pang of regret. &#39;Of course, it doesn&#39;t 
take much to kill innocence,&#39; she mused as she walked to the hotel, 
&#39;just a few years of bitter experience can do it.&#39;

The interior of the hotel was as Najica remembered it, walking past the 
main check in desk she headed to the door to the right, leading to the 
popular bar. IT was set up to be cozy and comfortable, with tables laid 
out to seat two to four people, nearly filled tonight as soft 
conversation washed over Najica. Men talked with women, women talked to 
women and men talked to men in a constant flow of chatter.

She was waiting as arranged in the corner table, the black haired woman 
looking up with a smile as she saw Najica approaching. &quot;Najica,&quot; Natsuko 
Kujo got up and moved close, startling Najica with a hug.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Najica tried to fend her off as the black haired woman tried to 
kiss her, &quot;stop that.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be a spoil sport, Honey,&quot; Natsuko laughed as the bust woman waved 
Najica to sit opposite her then sat down.

Najica sat down, feeling a slight blush teasing her cheeks. Somehow 
Natsuko managed to fluster her every time they met, from the illegal 
gambling ring they busted up to when they fought side by side to save 
the Desert Fox. &quot;A intelligence report from the... agency I work for 
told me you were in town,&quot; she said dryly, &quot;I&#39;m just here to hopefully 
find out what you might be up to this time.&quot;

Natsuko grinned as she sat back, the cut of her dress nearly letting her 
nipples pop out as she winked, &quot;Who says I&#39;m up to anything, Honey?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re up to something,&quot; Najica rolled her eyes as she added a 
bit testily, &quot;and I wish you&#39;d please stop calling me that.&quot;

&quot;Wny?&quot; Natsuko smirked as she leaned forward this time, her dress 
hugging her curvy body in dangerous ways as she asked her, &quot;Are you 
scared it would wreck your tough girl image?&quot;

Najica swallowed, feeling a odd tightness in her throat as she answered, 
&quot;Yes, I suppose so. I sometimes need to command relative strangers, and 
I can&#39;t have them thinking I&#39;m weak.&quot;

Natsuko reached out to squeeze her hand gently as she said, &quot;If anyone 
thinks you&#39;re weak they deserve the ass kicking they&#39;re going to get.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Najica blushed, surprisingly touched by that remark.

Rather surprisingly Natsuko gave her a chance to recover her composure, 
instead waving down a waiter and ordering drinks. &quot;They have a pretty 
good house red,&quot; she noted to Najica as the waiter stood nearby, &quot;is 
that all right?&quot;

Before Najica could respond, she felt a stocking leg stroke along her 
own. &quot;The red should be fine,&quot; she managed to choke out as a foot 
pressed against her leg, rising against the skin of her thigh. A blush 
colored her cheeks as she felt a foot move daringly between her legs!

&quot;Leave the bottle,&quot; Natsuko told the waiter as he left.

&quot;Stop that!&quot; Najica hissed as she closed her legs, catching the 
wandering foot.

Natsuko wiggled her toes as she purred, &quot;I knew I&#39;d have your thighs 
wrapped around me some time.&quot; She smirked, &quot;I think my foot&#39;s happy 
right where it is.&quot;

Najica fought down the urge to shoot the woman, noting that her primary 
gun was at home on a dresser. &#39;Not that I couldn&#39;t shoot her with my 
backup,&#39; she savored the comforting thought. &quot;Remove the foot,&quot; she 
ordered her stiffly, &quot;or suffer the consequences.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Natsuko answered cheerfully as the waiter returned with a 
aged bottle and two glasses.

THe waiter expertly popped the bottle open then poured for then both 
before setting it in the middle of the table. &quot;If you need anything 
else,&quot; he bowed, &quot;just ask for Gusto.&quot;

Waiting till Gusto left them Natsuko smiled, &quot;Unclench your thighs and I 
promise not to misbehave again.&quot;

Najica hesitated a moment then parted her thighs, feeling a moment of 
relief as Natsuko drew her foot back. Then, she daringly ran her toe 
along Najica&#39;s cleft, drawing her foot away before the blushing Najica 
could &#39;catch&#39; her again. &quot;Natsuko!&quot; she growled out.

Natsuko had to grin as she murmured, &quot;You&#39;re adorable when you blush.&quot;

&quot;Stop that!&quot; Najica muttered, blushing fiercely.

Natsuko sipped her wine as she quoted, &quot;Your lips say no, but your eyes 
say yes.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

The morning sun shone through the windows, splashing on the bed as 
Najica grumbled in her sleep. Natsuko watched her sleep, reaching out to 
gently run her fingers through Najica&#39;s hair. Her eyes roamed over 
Najica&#39;s nearly nude body, her memories of pleasuring that body stirring 
her hunger. Part of her wanted to wake Najica, to pounce on her again 
but for now she let her sleep.

&#39;How long have I loved her?&#39; Natsuko wondered. If might have been the 
first time they met, when Najica had helped her avenge her parents 
death, but however long it had been Natsuko had it bad. &#39;And she doen&#39;t 
love me,&#39; Natsuko admitted to herself with a sigh. She knew Najica was 
fond of her, maybe even cared for her, but love? No.

&quot;Natsuko?&quot; Najica blinked, looking up at her, &quot;Why are you frowning?&quot;

&#39;Oh well,&#39; Natsuko thought as she kissed Najica again, &#39;might as well 
seize the day.&#39; She smiled down at Najica, &quot;Just plotting what to do 
with you next. I think we still have some whipped cream left....&quot;

End.

Notes: Yes, that&#39;s Gusto from Agent Aika as a waiter. I keep meaning to 
write a actual Agent Aika and Najica crossover, but I never seem to get 
around to it. This is based on a canon lesbian character from Najica, 
Natsuko, who chases after Najica in the first two books of the manga.</pre>
