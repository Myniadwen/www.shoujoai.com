<h1>Those Obnoxious Ohtori! (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../urusei/index.html">Urusei Yatsura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../urusei/obnox-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Akio Ohtori, the school&#39;s Dean of Students, quickly ran by the outdoor 
table they were sitting at. His normally stylish look was strongly 
singed along the edges, and his clothes were still smoking lightly. 
Lum flew along right behind him, her hands upraised to fire off 
another devastating bolt of lightning at him.

&quot;Akio no Baka!&quot; the clearly furious Lum roared, and then she let loose 
with another massive lightning bolt.

Anthy chased after both of them as quickly as she could manage in her 
rose bride dress. She seemed to be trying to save Akio&#39;s life, or at 
least to calm the nearly bezerk Lum down, and not really succeeding.

&quot;What do you think he did to her?&quot; Kozue asked Utena curiously, as 
they watched them all run into the greenery of the rose garden.

&quot;It looked like he tried to grab her bottom,&quot; Utena said tiredly. She 
sighed and shook her head at the behavior of the Ohtori Dean of 
Students. They shared a nod, then winced at the sound of a lot of 
glass breaking, and more yelling.

&quot;I was wondering how you manage with Anthy?&quot; Kozue asked Utena 
curiously, and then waited attentively for an answer.

&quot;I&#39;m not quite sure what you mean,&quot; Utena said, playing dumb.

&quot;I mean, well, Lum follows me everywhere, she insists we&#39;re engaged, 
and she,&quot; Kozue blushed a bit, &quot;slept with me last night!&quot;

&quot;I try to keep in mind that Anthy didn&#39;t ask to be engaged to me,&quot; 
Utena explained to Kozue gently. &quot;She&#39;s just fulfilling her role as 
rosebride,&quot; Utena said a bit sadly, &quot;there&#39;s nothing personal in it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d like there to be, though,&quot; Kozue said softly, looking across at 
Utena. She blushed a bit, not confirming or denying.

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Utena said hurriedly, &quot;Lum didn&#39;t have much 
choice but to be engaged to you.&quot;

&quot;According to her people&#39;s custom,&quot; Kozue said with a weary sigh. &quot;But 
I never asked for any of this!&quot; she suddenly shouted.

&quot;Did Lum?&quot; Utena pointed out.

Kozue stopped. &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; she admitted. She looked 
thoughtfully over at Utena, &quot;So I should just make the best of it?&quot;

&quot;Basically, yes,&quot; Utena said with a nod. Just then Lum flew from 
behind the rose garden to tackle Kozue.

&quot;Darling, did you miss me?&quot; Lum said cheerfully, planting a kiss on 
Kozue&#39;s cheek. The blue haired girl blushed mightily.

Anthy calmly walked out of the garden and over to where they were 
sitting. &quot;So, how&#39;s Akio?&quot; Utena asked her curiously.

&quot;I think he&#39;ll live,&quot; Anthy answered, an impish little smile teasing 
the corners of her mouth. She looked over at Lum, &quot;It looks like 
things will be much more interesting around here with you around.&quot; </pre>
