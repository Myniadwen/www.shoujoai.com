<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Suguru had been informed of Yumi’s presence, but also  of the way in which she was present. The hands, but more, that  slightly crimson, entirely joyful, color on her face. He was in his  office at the time, working on a proposal to expand several  manufacturing operations to China; in truth, he had a whole drawer  full of these proposals. Some would probably never see the light of  day, like an author’s ubiquitous drawer of unused ideas, but more,  he was confident, would. When the man informed him, he nodded and  pretended to take notes—<em>notes, </em>for  the love of god, on what? On Sachiko finding a good woman? What a  joke, but he was expected to take notes on everything. He was  learning, after all, and observing; he actually drew a rough sketch  of a cat—and then dismissed the man. After the man left, he  examined the sketch of the cat, made a few quick corrections, and  thought he might frame it. Was this a happy event? Certainly for  Sachiko. And hell, maybe for him too.</p>
<p>It was the end of something easy, was what it was. And  the beginning of something fun. And there was a certain sense of  relief about it, as well: He, he knew, would have been just fine  marrying Sachiko, but Satoru wouldn’t have been okay with it, not  for long, and Satoru would have left before long. And Satoru deserved  more than that anyway. Than being his eternal <em>dirty  little secret. </em>He had his own damn life, and  his own goals, and a man had to be settled, have peace in his life,  before he could pursue his goals.</p>
<p>He thought about it for a while, and then called Satoru.</p>
<p>Satoru was very happy about it. He was fine being told  that it would be rough times ahead. That Suguru would be a very busy  man for a while, because he would come out on top. Had to. That,  Satoru said, was fine. He could handle busy. He was busy himself.  Being a teacher was not an easy thing, after all.</p>
<p>In truth, Suguru was happy too.</p>
<p>After all, one of the greatest disadvantages to being  rich, to be simply handed wealth, was that you never got to look back  on how you got it, because really, that was the fun part. That was  why the very rich never stopped making money; not because they felt  they needed it, but because they wanted to see how much they could  make. Because it was fun, because it was a challenge. (But after a  while, the challenge grew weak—after all, vast amounts of money  practically grew themselves.)</p>
<p>They chatted for a while after that. Suguru hung up  eventually, telling him he had a picture of a cat to frame. Satoru  asked him what the hell he was talking about, and Suguru said it  would be his anniversary present. Satoru sputtered, and Suguru told  him he loved him and hung up laughing.</p>
<p>The challenging part would be telling the parents, he  knew. Not his own; they knew and they didn’t give a flying fuck.  They had been relegated to the edge of the family long ago, getting a  generous monthly stipend and basically just living their lives in  more comfort than a manga artist and a journalist could have expected  otherwise. His father had always told him he loved his brother, but  that lifestyle wasn’t really for him, anyway.</p>
<p>That was fine. To each their own. That was what he  believed, and that was what had killed him about having to fetch  Sachiko; but if he was to get in by marriage, he had to appear to be  a strong candidate. Now that he didn’t have to worry about  marriage, he could do things his way.</p>
<p>A while later, he called Sachiko, and congratulated her.  Sachiko was very even with him; if she had any surprise about him  knowing so quickly, she suppressed it. But, there was something …  awkward about the whole thing.</p>
<p><em>Right. The whole </em>rejected  lover <em>bit. </em></p>
<p>“We’ll need to tell your parents,” Suguru said.  “It’s not going to be pretty.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to tell them?”</p>
<p>Suguru frowned. “I mean, about…”</p>
<p>“Is it really their business? We’re not getting  married, I’m going to college, and—” <em>And  if they don’t like it, they can sit on it and shove it up their  ass. </em>Suguru grinned. “If they don’t like  it, it’s their problem. I’m still my own person, and legally,  they cannot take that away from me.”</p>
<p>This was not the careful, restrained Sachiko he had  known at all.</p>
<p>He liked this Sachiko much better.</p>
<p>“Even the wedding will cause trouble. Weddings are an  expensive business even before they’re put on.”</p>
<p>“I think that even with this financial setback the  Ogasawara family will find itself safely in the black this year,”  Sachiko said dryly, and Suguru thought, that if he <em>were </em>capable of being interested in women, he  would very much like this one.</p>
<p>“And…they may well cut you off.”</p>
<p>Sachiko said nothing for a moment, and then, “You  know, I want to be an author. I decided that. I’m going to study  literature in college, graduate, and start writing.”</p>
<p>“That’s…not always a very lucrative profession.”  Not usually, actually, especially with most of the contracts that  young authors and artists were made to sign. Ogasawara, after all,  had its fingers in the publishing pie as well.</p>
<p>“I once read, I don’t remember where, that if  somebody writes something and sells it, and they receive a check,  cash the check, which does not bounce, and use the money to go home  and pay the lighting bill, they can be considered a good author.”  Suguru heard this and he saw all the lessons Sachiko had learned,  with none of the directives they had come with. Smart, coy,  articulate; capable of gently redirecting a conversation into a  lucrative direction without the added directive of <em>but  never do it except for social gain.</em></p>
<p>He laughed. Honestly and heartily. That was beautiful.  Wonderful. He loved it. They were silent for a while, and then he  said, “If you do ever need help, though…not now, but maybe five  years down the road…”</p>
<p>“Then I’m sure I’ll have other friends to turn  to,” Sachiko said sharply, then after a moment, her tone softened.  “I’m sorry. That was harsh.” A bit of the old Sachiko.</p>
<p>“I’m a tough boy,” Suguru said. “And there’s  no need to be a lady around me.”</p>
<p>“If I am really in trouble, I will call you, Suguru.”</p>
<p>“Fair deal. I’m sure I’ll see you again before you  go off to university.”</p>
<p>“You may just.”</p>
<p>They hung up. No goodbyes. No tearful thank-yous. Why  bother? They were a tough lot.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Sachiko’s parents did not take it well at all, or at  least, not publically. Her mother went into something which resembled  hysterics, and her father actually stormed out, slammed the door.  Sachiko was, indeed, cut off.</p>
<p>However, after the door was slammed, Sachiko’s  mother’s hysterics stopped immediately. She smiled at the two of  them, and said, “You know, you two would have made a good couple.”</p>
<p>“No, mother,” Sachiko said. “We really wouldn’t  have.”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” the older woman shrugged. “You really  have made it hard on yourselves, though. Both of you. Suguru, you are  not going to have an easy time if you still plan on advancing through  the company.”</p>
<p>Suguru shrugged. “I’ll be going to university in the  fall. If I apply myself I’m pretty sure I can graduate in three  years, have my masters in four. I would hazard a guess that none of  the other candidates for this job get a degree that fast.”</p>
<p>“Taro is close to his Master’s right now, in  America.”</p>
<p>“How’s his GPA looking?”</p>
<p>Sachiko’s mother grinned then, and Sachiko saw a  glimpse of the fiery woman who had birthed her. “Not great, I’ll  tell you. He seems to have met a very pretty lady who enjoys drinking  and cavorting about a great deal.”</p>
<p><em>A man must have peace in his life before he can  pursue his goals. </em></p>
<p>“I’ll make it, then. I’m the best, and you know it  and so do I.”</p>
<p>Sachiko’s mother smiled. “I do indeed.”</p>
<p>“So then…what?” Sachiko asked. “Shall I  just…pack my things? The semester starts in little over a month,  and I’m sure I can stay with Yumi until then. Or Sei, or someone.”</p>
<p>“I’ll not have you imposing on them like that,”  her mother snapped, and then frowned a second. “I’m sorry. The  point is, I’ll make sure you have a place to live. And frankly,  I’ll make sure you have a little extra.”</p>
<p>“Mother, you—”</p>
<p>“A mother is supposed to put her child through  college. It’s one of our duties, and one I’ll not miss out on.  Your father is not furious either, you know, but he does have to cut  you off.” Her mother had a shaky note in her voice but she said  what she needed to say clearly, and Sachiko understood.</p>
<p>In truth, it was hardly his money anyway. It was tied up  in stocks and investments, half of which had dubious ownership rights  to begin with. If the board decided it, they could make him…not a <em>poor </em>man, but a man  with much less to his name. And that was fine. Appearances, after  all.</p>
<p>People at heart were not bad, not really, not usually.  But there were expectations which hit them from every angle, and the  more public, the more influential they became, the more expectations  they had to deal with. Some of them could do it; some couldn’t.  Sachiko’s mother had been one that couldn’t, and it had done  terrible things to her, but she was still a mother at heart, first  and foremost. The Ogasawara group was a fucking huge conglomerate and  a lot of people depended on it for their livelihood, and a sudden  ousting of such skilled leadership would benefit none of them. Her  father knew that, and he did what he had to. Another woman might have  resented him for it—after all, it was a <em>lot </em>of money she was going to lose, but not  Sachiko. Sachiko had grown up with that money, and nobody had asked  her if she wanted it or not, so she had decided without anybody  asking, and probably he understood that. She wanted to give it a run  without the money. If she was truly talented as an author, she would  make enough to live comfortably with. If not, well…she was smart.  There were other things she could do, more lucrative ones.</p>
<p>But whatever they were, they were hers, and hers alone.</p>
<p>She moved out two days later into a nice apartment in  urban Tokyo. Her father gave her a hug and a wad of 10,000 yen notes,  and told her he loved her and he’d be in touch. Her mother did more  or less the same. Nobody was around to see it. Now that the pressure  of marriage and succession had vanished from their lives, Sachiko’s  parents behaved very much like real people. She wished she’d gotten  to know those people better.</p>
<p>She had a housewarming party, and invited the entire  Rose Council, past and present. Sei and Shimako seemed closer than  they had been, but she might have been just been jumping to  conclusions based on the way they entered holding hands and were  caught at one point tossing each other <em>gazes</em>.  Youko brought her boyfriend, a handsome man with an effeminate, easy  smile who fit in with a large group of girls more easily than might  have made Youko comfortable. Rei and Yoshino looked a little  dejected, because apparently Yoshino had gotten it into her head to  study abroad in America, which meant a year apart. Sachiko, however,  knew they would be more than fine. They were closer than anybody she  had ever met. A lot of laughs traded hands, as did a bit of alcohol,  and Sachiko found that she could laugh more freely. That night she  shared her bed with Yumi, and didn’t have to be sneaky about it in  the least; she simply called cabs for everyone but Yumi, and then  invited her to bed afterwards. Her mother had nothing to say about it  whatsoever; in fact, she hadn’t heard internally from her mother in  a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because, as hard as it was, she was a big  girl now. A woman. And a woman loved her mother, but a woman was not  her mother, and as long as a mother still had a hand in controlling a  woman’s life there would always be that pull, to be who her mother  was. It wasn’t malicious. It was natural. It was just the way  things went.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Sachiko moved into her dorm at Tokyo  University. Yumi didn’t live with her, it was too late to change  her living arrangements (and frankly, not a great idea anyway—Sachiko  felt as though it would have been okay, but wanted to do this  properly) but lived only a few blocks away. They had one class  together, and they walked there holding hands every day.</p>
<p>They made a lot of memories there, ones that made more  imprints in Sachiko than any other time up until that point. She  developed laugh lines. She put on a little weight, lost it, put it  back on again. She learned to cook for herself, and learned to hold  her liquor. She got a part-time job, quit it, got a better one. She  pulled a few all nighters, cursed a few deadlines as sons of bitches,  and got her first short story into the campus literary review her  sophomore year. She and Yumi fought, made up, and made love many  times.</p>
<p>And after that?</p>
<p>That is for nobody but the two themselves.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank my editor, Sumiregawa_Nenene, for  faithfully sticking with me for these past two plus years, editing  this mess into something mildly fit for human consumption, and I’d  like to thank you, dear readers, for sticking with me too, till the  end. It’s been a long haul, and I feel sad to see it go, because it  was my baby, but there will be others, too. Probably.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have done it, though, without all of you.  Thank you, and have a wonderful day.</p>
