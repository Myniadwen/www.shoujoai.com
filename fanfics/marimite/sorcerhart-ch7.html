<h1>The Sorceress's Heart (part 7 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/andwick.html">Andwick</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sorcerhart-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p>Glossary: "Yoshinosuke": Eriko is playing around; -suke is an ending more usually found 
on boys' names. "We have perhaps an hour..." : Two hours to us. The Heian day was divided 
into twelve hours, each one two of our hours long, each named after, naturally, an animal of 
the Chinese zodiac. The "hour of the Boar" is around 10:00pm. "Kannon-sama": Chinese 
Guanyin, the female bodhisattva of compassion; eleven-headed, thousand-handed, Kannon the 
Merciful. "Rei-pochi": Noriko is being fanciful. "Pochi" is a fairly common dog name in 
Japan, roughly equivalent to "Spot" or "Rover." (Though I don't know how often it's used as 
an honorific.) I gather dogs aren't kept as pets in Japan as often as over here, and I'm not 
sure about the history of the practice, but Sei Shonagon does tell a rather sad story about 
a pet dog, so we can be fairly sure the idea wouldn't have been completely strange to her 
contemporaries.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>VI. The Compass Points</p><p>When Sei found Sachiko, she was 
kneeling on the ground near the southern wall of the enclosure and holding one of Yumi's 
shoes. There seemed to be an aura of winter around her; Sei almost felt the temperature drop 
as she came near.</p><p>"Sachiko..." Sei said. She steeled herself. She wondered if she was 
going to get the same treatment as Suguru. Sachiko was certainly in the right mood to dish 
it out. "This, well, this may not be as black as it appears..."</p><p>Sachiko looked up. Her 
face had that blank, expressionless calm which usually boded extremely ill for whomever she 
directed it at. And she directed it at Sei for a very long moment. Sei, who had stared down 
dragons (the sort with actual wings), nevertheless felt a tickle of 
nervousness.</p><p>"Spare me the hollow words of comfort," Sachiko said at last. "You lost 
track of her, Sei."</p><p>Sei looked off toward Mount Hiei in the northeast. "Yes. Shimako 
came up, and I was talking to her. I was going to introduce them. But when I looked for her, 
Yumi was gone. I looked away from her for a minute at most. I understand your being upset, 
but..." Sei didn't know just what to say. "Look --"</p><p>"Never mind about that right 
now."</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"Recriminations are a waste of time. I might have the leisure 
later on --" a stabbing glance -- "but not now. Yumi's missing, and she has to be 
found."</p><p>Sei's mind cleared. Sachiko wasn't made to grant forgiveness easily, but then, 
Sei wasn't made to ask for it. As long as they both understood that -- "You're right, 
Sachiko, my old frozen hedgehog. Look, maybe she's just gone back to the Inn."</p><p>"Please 
do not call me an old frozen hedgehog. And why --" Sachiko held up the shoe, and a corner of 
pale green robe -- "would she leave <i>these</i> behind?"</p><p>"You have me there," Sei 
admitted. "My <i>young</i> frozen hedgehog."</p><p>Sachiko seemed oblivious to this last 
sally. Mystification increased in her brows. "She ran away. <i>Why</i> did she run 
away?"</p><p>"Maybe --"</p><p>"What did I do wrong?" This was spoken low, almost as if 
Sachiko were talking to herself.</p><p>Sei boggled. "Sachiko, I doubt like hell it was 
anything <i>you</i> did."</p><p>Sachiko looked up. "You're sure?"</p><p>Sachiko's blank calm 
was eroding. She was more vulnerable than Sei had ever seen her, and Sei felt a touch of 
pity. And fear. "Come <i>on</i>, my old buttered parsnip. Yumi's mad about you! We've all 
seen... The only reason I can think of that makes sense is, she must have thought it would 
be best for <i>you</i> if she left --"</p><p>"How could <i>that</i> be the best thing for 
me?" Sachiko rose suddenly. She seemed to be on the point of that terrible cold fury 
again.</p><p>"Well, when we find her, you can ask her that. Please don't lose your cool 
again, Sachiko --"</p><p>"I won't," she said curtly. "Fujiwara-dono was right. If I am to 
find her, help her, I have to keep my head. But the idea of her leaving being good for me is 
foolish -- I was <i>balanced</i>, Sei. It's as if an important piece was missing, and I 
didn't know until I found her -- and lost her --"</p><p>They turned at a noise, and there 
were a great many well-known faces approaching, from the garden. Youko. Rei and Yoshino, 
carefully not looking at one another. And Shimako, moving now to Sei's side. And there was 
Eriko, how nice, it had been months since Sei had seen her.</p><p><i>The Gang's all 
here!...</i></p><p>"We're looking for Yumi, Sachiko. No argument," Youko said.</p><p>"But we 
leave on the Questioning tomorrow morning --" Sachiko ran her eyes over them. "You all have 
so much to do --"</p><p>"<i>You</i>, Sachiko, should go back to the Inn and wait. You're 
still supposed to be guarding the egg."</p><p>Youko was looking at Sachiko in a calm, hard 
way. <i>She's furious about what just happened,</i> Sei realized. <i>Everybody is mad at 
everybody else -- there's the devil to pay, and no pitch hot. Lady Mary, pity 
us.</i></p><p>After letting the Look sink in a bit, Youko turned to the others. "Let's 
divide the city into quarters. I'm northwest, Sei is northeast, Rei-chan is southwest, Eriko 
is southeast. Shimako-chan, you can assist Sei of course, and Yoshino-chan --"</p><p>"I'd 
like to come with you, Youko-sama."</p><p>Yoshino's voice, while perfectly audible, was 
still more subdued than anyone was used to hearing it.</p><p>Rei was not looking at anybody. 
She appeared to be glaring at a tree branch to her right.</p><p>Youko didn't let that 
silence go on any longer than she could help. "I have just chosen a new imouto, 
Yoshino-chan, and I think she'll want to assist me. But perhaps Eriko would --"</p><p>"You 
come along with me, Yoshinosuke," said Eriko. "We'll have some laughs, I bet."</p><p>Yoshino 
went to stand by Eriko.</p><p>"I'll trade with Rei, I think," Sei said. "I've a lead I'd 
like to try in the southwest."</p><p>"Of course; the southwest is really your city, isn't 
it, Sei?" Youko gave her a very dear smile. "Very well. Rei-chan?..."</p><p>"I'll take the 
northeast," Rei affirmed. "Noriko-chan can help me."</p><p>When this did not provoke a 
shriek of indignation from Yoshino, Sei was positive that something was desperately wrong, 
and resolved to get a hold of Rei and grill her at the earliest opportunity. Right now, Yumi 
took priority, however.</p><p>Sachiko, for her part, had folded and rolled Yumi's outer 
robes, and now put them through the toes of the sandals, and handed the little bundle to 
Sei. "I suspect you'll be the one to find her. Will you see that she puts these on? The day 
is turning chilly."</p><p>Sei accepted the items gingerly. She was still waiting for an 
explosion, from any of the possible local tinderboxes, and perhaps it was mischief that made 
her say, "You're taking this well, Sachiko," in an offhand manner.</p><p>"I'm not," Sachiko 
answered calmly. She turned to Youko, and her voice remained calm. "I'm furious at you. I 
think you've arranged things high-handedly. I think that as she's <i>my</i> imouto, it's 
<i>my</i> job to find her, not yours, Sei's, or anyone else's. I think that if I don't go 
looking, but send everyone else instead, that tells her I don't care about her enough to 
look myself. I think that the egg could be taken back and temporarily lodged in its usual 
prison at the Guild offices while I search for Yumi. I think a lot of other things, which I 
hold back from saying, because they might hurt people's feelings. But you and everyone else 
seem to think, as with one mind, that I should stay in my room with my nose to the wall 
while the grownups look for Yumi. So I succumb to majority opinion, re-swallow my spleen, 
escort the novices back to the guild dormitories -- which I feel sure you were about to ask 
me to do, with your usual tact and charm -- and then I'll go home, play with my dolls, and 
sulk. But you have not heard the last of this, Mizuno-sama."</p><p>Sachiko turned and walked 
back toward the Pine Grove. A sudden wind whipped up, causing the trees and bushes around 
her to express in involuntary dance the agitation she no doubt felt inside, and whipped the 
hems of her robes about her waist and legs. She continued to walk steadily, however, and 
would no doubt be a model of propriety in fulfilling her duties with the novices.</p><p>The 
others looked sympathetically at Youko, whose left eyebrow was twitching a bit. Even Yoshino 
and Rei seemed to have forgotten their own troubles for the moment.</p><p>"Do you still have 
all your fingers and toes?" Sei asked solicitously. "I can help you look --"</p><p>"Shut up, 
Sei. Come on, everyone. We have perhaps an hour before we start to lose the 
sun."</p><p>"I'll go after Sachiko," Rei said calmly. "I have to pick up Noriko-chan, 
anyway."</p><p>Yoshino moved quickly to Rei's side. "Rei-chan," she hissed, grabbing at 
Rei's arm, "why do you have to be so --"</p><p>And Rei shook her off. "I would rather you 
didn't hang on me," she said quietly, with no particular emphasis. She did not look at 
Yoshino. "I wish to be left alone."</p><p>And she went off after Sachiko, leaving Yoshino 
stunned and silent, and everyone else unable to look at her.</p><p>--</p><p>Youko caught up 
with Fujiwara-dono in the front room of the Jijuden, where she had accompanied the Emperor 
after the scene in the garden. The Emperor was now in retirement with Fujiwara no Yukinaga. 
"It's a bit upsetting for everyone, especially the boy -- an exile being caught in the 
Enclosure," Fujiwara-dono confided in her cheerfully. "Of course, it was known that he had 
gone missing from Kyushu, but it was assumed that he had been murdered by robbers, or eaten 
by beasts in the wilderness. He had no escort, you see."</p><p>"Will he be 
executed?"</p><p>"Probably. Yuki-chan has never liked him, and of course the wretch has no 
influence left apart from Prince Suguru, who has troubles of his own now. But I don't 
know... Toru-chan looks up to Prince Suguru. On the other hand, Yuki-chan has ruled 
Toru-chan since the boy was five... Well, I have my own work to be getting on with. But do 
keep me informed on the Yumi-kun matter. She seems a dear girl. Look for a few hours, and if 
you can't find her, I'll have a go."</p><p>"I just... I beg your pardon," Youko said. "I 
shouldn't bother you with --"</p><p>"Mizuno-san." Fujiwara-dono spoke in a gentler tone now. 
She came forward and put a hand on Youko's shoulder. "You're worried about Ogasawara-kun. Of 
course you are."</p><p>"Not worried about her, so much as furious at her."</p><p>"Well, that 
too."</p><p>"Aren't you, Fujiwara-dono?" Youko looked hard at her teacher. "I mean to say... 
she went <i>mad</i>."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"Miss Perfect Control <i>lost</i> control, 
completely." Youko fumed more, the more she thought about it.</p><p>"I saw."</p><p>"And it 
was mostly only friends of hers who saw it, but even so, I expect it will be all over the 
Guild -- all over the <i>City</i> -- in a matter of days. The <i>Emperor</i> saw it! My 
imouto -- in front of the Emperor --"</p><p>"There, there, my pet," Fujiwara-dono was 
patting Youko's cheek. "You're a bit upset; only natural."</p><p>"If this does get around 
--"</p><p>Fujiwara-dono cut in unexpectedly, in a completely different tone from what she'd 
been using. "It will enhance the Guild's rather fierce reputation with a fresh example, 
without adding to it in any significant way. Pray compose yourself, Mizuno-san. You know 
perfectly well that we are known for overkill and bloodlust. The reputation is not entirely 
deserved, but there have been a few who lived up to it, and some of our more admired members 
as well. Ogasawara-kun looks a right humanitarian next to some of them." This startled 
Youko, and she supposed it showed on her face, as Fujiwara-dono looked at her sadly, and 
sighed. "When a friend counselled mercy and forbearance, she <i>listened</i>. The more 
notorious angry sorceresses often haven't."</p><p>Youko felt some chagrin. Fujiwara-dono had 
tended to treat her more or less as an equal, ever since she had been accorded the dignity 
of a Winging Crane, and only occasionally slipped back into regarding her as a dunderheaded 
junior. "I'm sorry, Fujiwara-dono. I only --" She cut herself off. Best not to qualify the 
apology. "This unworthy one begs forgiveness."</p><p>"Granted. Mizuno-san, I understand your 
concern. But Ogasawara-kun's progress is of particular interest to me, as you know, and part 
of this teaching business is to make sure all parts and passions are in place. A sorceress 
who is an incomplete person may do incomplete work, or may do wickedness without meaning to, 
unpredictably. This is the first time I have ever seen Ogasawara-kun really passionate about 
anything, so much so that she lost her sangfroid, and it's something of a relief to me. No, 
no. I agree that such behavior cannot be countenanced. But, Mizuno-san... try an 
experiment."</p><p>"Fujiwara-dono, perhaps I should --"</p><p>"The search for Yumi-kun, of 
course. Humor me for a moment. Think back a few years, to when you first made Ogasawara-kun 
your soror mystica. A sheltered girl, from a good house. A defenseless girl, not quite 
grown. A difficult girl, sometimes not easy to like perhaps, but nevertheless a girl you 
came to cherish quite quickly. A girl who clung to your sleeve when she didn't understand 
what was happening. I haven't seen her do that in quite a while, but I remember her doing it 
more than once, and I remember wondering what combination of fear and devotion would allow a 
girl like that to show weakness in public. Oh, yes, she and I come from the same 
neighborhood, you know. And I remember how protective you were. An arm around her shoulder, 
whenever she seemed to need it. She always slept in your tent when a-journeying, in your 
bedroll, even --"</p><p>"Fujiwara-dono! Do you suggest that I might have ever done what she 
did, today? Just because I --" Youko stopped. Fujiwara-dono's words had brought back a time 
she remembered without remembering, it might be said; a time she could easily acknowledge 
had indeed passed in her life, though she didn't often recall it in detail. She remembered 
her feelings for her imouto, who had looked up to her so, and who had seemed unable to think 
of any better way of spending her time than to spend it with Youko. And she remembered her 
own fears, back then: <i>Am I the right teacher for her? Will I be able to keep her on the 
straight path? Or am I wronging her by pretending, to both of us and to the world, that I am 
the mistress she needs?</i> Youko's whole disposition, as well as her training, was never to 
show uncertainty, and to always see the best course, and see it clearly, and steer for it. 
Like any human person she was still subject to uncertainty however, and came closer to 
showing it over Sachiko than anything else... because at the time Sachiko had been more 
important than anything else... <i>or</i> almost <i>anything else... but of all the 
important things, Sachiko was closest, and most vulnerable</i>... <i>I need to know I've 
done right by her; that, more than anything, is what upsets me about what happened today, 
the thought that it happened because I left something out of her training... I need to know 
she's going to be all right... I --</i></p><p>"Love her? Yes; you love her. And no, I'm not 
suggesting that you would ever do anything as nasty as what she did today; you've always had 
a bit too much self-control for that. You keep your head, Mizuno-san, even when all about 
you are losing theirs, and blaming it on you. You are known for it. But I strongly suspect 
that, if your difficult, headstrong, sometimes ill-natured little darling had ever been 
molested in any way, and you had happened to catch the molester --"</p><p>"I'm telling you I 
<i>wouldn't</i>, Fujiwara-dono!"</p><p>"No, no, you wouldn't. But, Mizuno-san, you 
<i>would</i> have had to <i>stop</i> yourself from doing it."</p><p>Youko said nothing. 
There was really nothing she could say.</p><p>"I sometimes think that we are very cruel, we 
of the Guild," Fujiwara-dono went on, stepping to a window. "We are a sort of 
socially-sanctioned anti-society bastion. We take girls from their families, and teach them 
skills subversive of reality, of the waking world itself... our work is necessary perhaps 
for the survival of the Empire, but it represents the triumph of dream over waking, shadow 
over substance: the reversal of their positions. People in general are therefore naturally 
suspicious of it, and wise men are always resentful of any power that is not theirs. The 
girls find themselves essentially disowned by their relatives -- oh, until they choose to 
leave the Guild, perform acts of cleansing, pilgrimages, marry, do as they're told, and so 
on. But while they're with us, none of their family or any of the people they grew up with 
want to have anything much to do with them. And in exchange for this sacrifice, we give the 
girls distant, unattainable mothers, like Suga-sama and myself. A bit like having a wolf or 
a bear, or sometimes a demon, for a mother. Is it not so?...</p><p>"Is it any wonder that 
sometimes a sorceress loses her temper?... No matter which way a woman goes, wife, nun, 
sorceress, it seems as if the price is too steep.</p><p>"We <i>do</i> give them sisterhood, 
however. We give them older sisters, and later younger sisters. And their lives in the Guild 
are defined through these relationships, to a startling extent... I talk to old girls 
sometimes, girls who left the Guild, usually around Dragon level, and are now mothers and 
grandmothers. Often girls who served in Koryo, or the Manchurian wars; very ably, some of 
them. Do they remember their great deeds, or the deeds of the great sorceresses they knew? 
Perhaps. But what they mostly talk about is their sisters. The older sisters who protected 
them, and the younger sisters they themselves protected. The girls they lived and served 
with. And they remember every trivial thing about them, as if it was yesterday." 
Fujiwara-dono shook her head. "Sad. All that knowledge of one another, and all that love in 
spite of the knowledge. Days and years of work and love intertwined. All meaningless now, 
except as beautiful memories, to comfort them when they're lonely, when their husbands or 
their children ignore them, when nobody understands them.</p><p>"You're all terribly 
important to each other. But I think... Mizuno-san... that Yumi-kun may be even more 
important to Ogasawara-kun than Ogasawara-kun was to you."</p><p>Youko said 
nothing.</p><p>"You know your own imouto best, so tell me if you really think I'm wrong. 
Yumi-kun had nothing, before Ogasawara-kun found her. And Yumi-kun is much more open with 
her feelings than Ogasawara-kun ever has been or will be. Yumi-kun adores her mistress and 
makes no secret of it. And Ogasawara-kun... has changed. Visibly. In less than two days. 
Extraordinary, is it not?"</p><p>"What does it all mean?" Youko was in a state of groping 
for words and ideas, as was often the case when Fujiwara-dono finally let on what she was 
thinking.</p><p>"I have no idea," Fujiwara-dono answered, without a trace of embarrassment. 
"There is a mystery here. It needs solving. Finding Yumi-kun may of itself necessitate a 
solution, or a partial one."</p><p>"I think that's what Sei has in mind," Youko mused. 
"Something she said when we parted, about retracing Yumi's steps --"</p><p>Fujiwara-dono 
smiled wolfishly. "She's nobody's fool, is Satou-san. I'm hoping she'll show some interest 
in attaining to the Guild leadership one day soon. Somehow I can't see her leaving to get 
married --"</p><p>"No," Youko said, with more abrupt firmness than was really necessary. She 
had a moment of confusion, made heavier by the weight of Fujiwara-dono's gentle, knowing 
smile pressing down on it, then added, "I'm not going anywhere either, Fujiwara-dono." Then 
a moment of greater confusion. Fujiwara-dono had always seemed to be grooming Youko for 
something, but had never said just what, and Youko hadn't been able to push herself to ask 
until this moment. "If it isn't the grossest impertinence to put my unworthy self 
forward..." She looked carefully at the floor, still feeling Fujiwara-dono's gentle, 
undemanding, ponderous gaze, light as wreaths of mountain cloud, heavy as the jungles of the 
south.</p><p>"Yes..." Fujiwara-dono said at last. "Yes. I did put your name forward as Grand 
Mugwump of the Dragons for a reason, of course. I'd have to be a fool, or Suga-san, not to 
see your many strengths. Your weaknesses you know about, and we have been working on them, 
you and I... Yes. With you and Satou-san primed to lead the Guild together, I could rest 
easy about the future. Just give me a little time..."</p><p>Fujiwara-dono was gone. There 
was no real moment of departure, just a brief transitional moment when Youko was not sure 
what, if anything, was in the room with her. The old mage was unaccountable that way; she 
could usually be found in her office and audience chamber on the third story at the northern 
end of the Guild building, but apart from that one never knew when she was going to arrive 
or depart. Youko had found that simply accommodating Fujiwara-dono's ways had helped her get 
on in the Dragon Order more than any other single thing she'd done.</p><p>She walked out of 
the Jijuden, and strolled south to the steps of the Throne Hall, where her new soror mystica 
was waiting under the cherry tree. She was in fact kicking the trunk absently with the toe 
of one sandal, and not caring that she was getting cherry blossoms in her hair. <i>My second 
soror mystica, and probably my last. Just as well.</i> Thinking of anyone other than Sachiko 
as her imouto was going to be strange enough as it was. "Sorry to keep you waiting, 
Touko."</p><p>"You aren't going to call me Touko-san?" the girl said, looking up sulkily 
from the roots.</p><p>"I don't have any plans that way, no."</p><p>"But, 
Youko-sama!..."</p><p>"And you call me 'Mistress,' not 'Youko-sama.' All right?"</p><p>"Oh, 
very well. Mistress."</p><p>"If it seems arbitrary, that's because it is. It's just the way 
we go on, in the Guild... Fujiwara-dono has said her say, and we have to make up for lost 
time. Come along, by my side."</p><p>They walked south, through two gates, and out into the 
City again. Youko felt herself relax. Her family had been servants to various families of 
the Yokibito for several generations, and she always felt centuries of conditioning settle 
like heavy snowdrifts on her shoulders when she went into the Nine-Fold Enclosure. Freedom 
was outside the Enclosure. <i>Real freedom is completely outside the city,</i> she 
reflected, as she had done before, and felt a pleasant quiver of anticipation for the 
morning.</p><p>They turned west on Second Street. The houses to the south became less 
opulent and less attractive as they moved further west, and the influence of the City of the 
Right became stronger. Touko was quiet, pensive for most of the way.</p><p>Then, as they 
were turning south on Nishiomiya Avenue, headed in the general direction of the Guild 
offices, Touko spoke. "Fujiwara-dono examined this Yumi, didn't she? Searched her 
mind?"</p><p>"Why, yes, she did. How did you know about that?"</p><p>"Hikaru-san overheard 
Yoshino-san and the General talking about it."</p><p>"Interesting. Indiscreet, perhaps. Oh, 
not that it's a great secret. But why do you bring it up?"</p><p>"Fujiwara-dono could 
probably find her faster than anybody, couldn't she?"</p><p>"Yes. And if time or the gravest 
danger were a consideration, she would probably do it herself. She prefers to let us manage 
things ourselves as much as possible. She has to know that ours are capable hands to leave 
the Guild in. As it is, we go a-Questioning in the morning, and if we haven't found little 
Yumi by the hour of the Boar, I will have to confess my failure, and Fujiwara-dono will have 
to exert herself."</p><p>"You'll wake an old lady at that hour?"</p><p>Youko smiled. 
"Fujiwara-dono does not actually sleep -- or at least, I've never been able to catch her at 
it. And it's unwise to call her an old lady."</p><p>Touko frowned. "We've put a lot of 
distance between us now. Do you really think she can hear me all the way out 
here?"</p><p>"'Mistress.'"</p><p>"Mistress, sorry."</p><p>"Yes, I do. And there's no way of 
knowing when she'll turn up anyway."</p><p>Pause.</p><p>"She <i>is</i> an old 
lady."</p><p>"She is, or she might be. But she does not care to have any fresh-faced girl 
tell her of it." <i>Especially not one like you, with an extra helping of sauce, and 
ridiculous curls in her hair.</i></p><p>Touko stared for a moment, and then smiled. "I'll 
keep that in mind, Mistress."</p><p>"You do that."</p><p>--</p><p>Eriko-sama and Yoshino 
were moving around the northern fringes of the Great Eastern Market, seeking the large 
pinkish-white mass of the cherry tree at its center. Eriko-sama was going to help Yoshino 
with the search spell. It was a bit more advanced magic than Yoshino was used to performing, 
but as Eriko-sama had not so much as seen Yumi yet, it had to be Yoshino who cast it. Or so 
Eriko-sama said. Yoshino, even as preoccupied as she was, suspected Eriko-sama of wanting to 
give her a difficult time, to teach her some sort of dreary lesson...</p><p>"What's the 
trouble with you and Rei, Yoshino?" Eriko-sama said abruptly, as they approached the 
tree.</p><p>"It's nothing," Yoshino said. Then wished she hadn't said anything, because 
"It's nothing," after the scene in the garden, sounded stupid.</p><p>"It's something. I've 
never seen you two so at odds before. You argue a lot but even then --"</p><p>"I would 
rather not discuss it, Eriko-sama --"</p><p>There was a gentle hand on the back of Yoshino's 
neck, and Eriko-sama was giving her a sweet, motherly look, under which even Yoshino quailed 
a bit. "Would you deny your grandsister, Yoshino? Rei is unhappy. She is still very precious 
to me, and always will be." Eriko-sama's grip on Yoshino's neck tightened ever so slightly. 
"If you have been trifling with her feelings, you little minx --"</p><p>"I tried to talk to 
her and she <i>shoved </i>me," Yoshino burst out. "She wouldn't even look at me. If I matter 
to her so little, then --"</p><p>"You know better, Yoshino. If there is one person in all 
the world who knows Hasekura Rei better than I, that one is you, who else? Level with me, 
you exasperating infant. You've been sniffing around boys again, haven't you?"</p><p>"I 
--"</p><p>"I really wish you'd make up your mind, you know. When I first noted your taste 
for masculine company, I was very happy for you -- 'A normal sister!' I thought. 'It's too 
bad for Rei, but Rei will have to grow up, I suppose. She'll get over it.' Except she 
<i>can't</i> get over it, because you keep going back to her. You keep bouncing back and 
forth: normal boy-hunger, and the floating world of girls together, and back again. You pull 
your cousin about so, twist her between two poles, I'm amazed she's still the same shape. I 
don't know why you don't just stab her in the heart and get it over with 
--"</p><p>"<i>You</i> --"</p><p>"Shshsh," Eriko-sama shshshed.</p><p>"It's not <i>my</i> 
fault," Yoshino said with furious hoarseness. "It's <i>not</i>. Why is she such a 
<i>fool</i>?"</p><p>"She's a fool, is she? A blithering, dunderheaded fool, moron, idiot of 
a Dragon-level sorceress. Hm. And that's why you chase after boys?"</p><p>Yoshino just 
glared, and growled a little. Eriko-sama was a hateful person. Funny she'd never realised it 
until now.</p><p>"You know perfectly well you chase after boys because you like them, not 
because Rei's a fool. Rei is no fool -- or rather, the one thing she's foolish about is you. 
She loves you to distraction. And she really imagines the two of you can make a life 
together. It'll never last, of course. Or it might last just long enough for you to both be 
senior sorceresses of unmarriageable age. But you don't love her, not really, and you won't 
be able to be happy with her, or make her happy in the end, and you might well destroy her 
with your hatred, with your jealousy for the life you might have had, the life you'll think 
she kept you from, when really it'll be <i>you</i> who kept <i>her</i> from a better life, 
purely and simply because you enjoy <i>tormenting</i> her, because deep down you <i>hate</i> 
her -- whoops!" Eriko-sama had to dodge, here, because Yoshinosuke had started swinging at 
her. Yoshinosuke had had about enough of this --</p><p>Then Yoshino was clutching her chest 
and gasping. There were sharp pains, and her chest was lurching and heaving, like her heart 
was trying to batter its way out --</p><p>Eriko-sama's arms were around her in an instant. 
Yoshino felt her chest calm down, the pain fade, a sun of warmth between them, and heard 
Eriko-sama singing in her ear:</p><p>Storms take the heavens<br>Unawares; the fire 
takes<br>The highest treetops.<br>The earth devours Heaven's pain;<br>All the rivers swell 
to flood.</p><p>The storm had passed. Yoshino felt able to stand, but still clutched at 
Eriko-sama, twisting her robes in angry fists. "I <i>love</i> Rei-chan -- I don't want to 
hurt her ever -- that was a cruel, wicked thing to say..."</p><p>"Yes, I know," Eriko-sama 
murmured in the same ear. "It would take a blind fool not to see how you love her. But 
Yoshino, you do hurt her with these little games of yours, and it would take a blind fool 
not to see <i>that</i>. Or a boy-crazy Yoshino, one of the two."</p><p>Yoshino had followed 
her own excitement, which she tended to do anyway. Usually Rei-chan encouraged that, and no 
one else cared. It seemed that this was a different matter, though: Rei-chan was angry, 
Yumi-san was missing, and everyone was worried. Her heart did whisper that she should have 
known quite well how Rei-chan would react. But she had thought she could have a little fun 
without Rei-chan finding out about it.</p><p><i>Oh, Rei-chan... oh, Yumi-san...</i> "What 
should I do?"</p><p>"I don't know. But the two of you have to find a better arrangement than 
the current one. You are a sweet, pretty little girl with the soul of a sweaty, hairy 
warrior, and you have a great and terrible power over Rei-chan. You could destroy her, not 
because you're evil or you hate her, but through simple carelessness. You don't want that to 
happen, do you?"</p><p>"No. No, never. I'll talk to her, Eriko-sama. I will. If she'll 
<i>let</i> me."</p><p>"Just give her a little time to cool down. That's all she needs. She 
loves you too much to stay mad for long."</p><p>"...yes. Eriko-sama, we should be looking 
for Yumi-san."</p><p>"Right. You're recovered?"</p><p>"Feel fine. Nice trick. Wish I could 
do it for myself."</p><p>"By the time you reach that level, you shouldn't need 
to."</p><p>Yoshino hoped not. "But Eriko-sama, why did we come here?"</p><p>"We do it here," 
Eriko-sama answered, "or rather start it here, because the Eastern Market is the center of 
the southeast quarter, and this cherry tree is the center of the Market. We start at the 
center and work our way outwards. That is how these things are done. Now. Make the Eye, as I 
showed you."</p><p>Yoshino scrunched up her face and concentrated -- spongy, slimy -- 
difficult -- until her whole head was one gigantic eye. "Done."</p><p>"Hood! 
Hood!"</p><p>"Ooops --" Yoshino threw the hood of her cloak over her head, or rather over 
her giant eyeball on the slender stalk of her neck.</p><p>"Better. The eye must be lidded, 
to focus on great distances -- and to keep from frightening passers-by out of their wits, of 
course. They might go right into hysterics. A giant eyeball with two cute little braids 
hanging down on either side of it! How macabre! Are you ready?"</p><p>"Don't make fun of my 
braids, Eriko-sama. Not when you've suddenly taken it into your head to dress like death on 
pilgrimage... Say, this isn't easy to keep up..."</p><p>"That is why I am here," Eriko-sama 
chuckled, taking Yoshino's upper arm.</p><p>Yoshino felt strength filling her. The feeling, 
so familiar because Rei-chan did it for her all the time and yet unfamiliar because it was 
Eriko-sama doing it for her now -- a different touch, a different presence within her -- 
made her feel like crying -- an urge she suppressed immediately. If she were to weep in her 
current state, her clothing would be soaked in salt water in short order. She'd seen it 
happen -- embarrassing --</p><p>She clutched at the hem of her hood, adjusting it in the air 
over her enormous pupil. The sun dimmed; the marketeers and shoppers and booths and blankets 
were under shadow, then there were sharp little lights everywhere decorating the shadowy 
people without destroying the shadow. Focus... right across the Market, to its northern 
edge. Focus on that building -- through the building. Room upon room, like a strange box 
puzzle, and little passageways, and little people moving in them, in all directions, toward 
one another, away from one another, in a kind of dance.</p><p>"Ooooo," Yoshino said 
happily.</p><p>Eriko-sama poked Yoshino in the side with one finger. "Don't become 
<i>too</i> entranced," she cautioned. "Try to focus on the particular person we're looking 
for."</p><p>"I would, like <i>that</i>, if she was anywhere in sight," Yoshino said 
irritably.</p><p>"She isn't? Then we change our <i>site</i>!" Eriko-sama grabbed Yoshino 
from behind, under her arms, and lifted her. Eriko-sama's cloak spread out, and resembled 
black leather wings. In a moment they were airborne, and well above the heads of the crowd, 
though still low enough to cause them some consternation. A low-flying bird of indeterminate 
species with a nine-foot wingspread and a giant eyeball on the top of its head, which 
eschews the more standard bird-sounds such as "caw! and "yark!" in favor of "Yoicks! Hark 
for'ard! Tally-ho!" and "Once around the Market, Eriko-sama, then north on Red Bird Avenue, 
and a hard right at Fifth Street! Full speed ahead and damn the pedestrians!" can have that 
effect on people.</p><p>--</p><p>Toshi the Rat leapt almost a whole foot when the hand 
landed on his right shoulder.</p><p>He didn't like being sneaked up on -- as which of us 
does? But as he was usually the one who did the sneaking, he was even more put out than most 
of us would be.</p><p>Especially as it occurred to him -- even before he'd turned around -- 
that the number of people who were actually <i>capable</i> of sneaking up on him was 
remarkably small and, given the general trend of recent events, there was really only one 
person it could be.</p><p>"There is a strange woman with no manners behind me," he said, to 
no one in particular, and turned around.</p><p>And there was that grin.</p><p>"Knew I could 
count on you, Tosh," said Satou Sei-san.</p><p>"And I can always count on <i>you</i>, for 
sure," Toshi said sourly. "What do you want?"</p><p>"The accomplices. Need to know where 
they're holed up."</p><p>"I can lead you to them," Toshi suggested. "It isn't far. Do you 
suppose you could avoid the sneaky-sneaky-aren't-I-clever in future?"</p><p>"'Fraid not, 
Tosh," Sei said gently, as they started out from the Western Market, going south along one 
of the disreputable and incomplete alleyways between Sai and Nishiomiya Avenues. "The main 
reasons being: I <i>am</i> sneaky, and I <i>am</i> clever. What's bred in the bone will not 
out of the flesh. Could you give up being a thief, ever?"</p><p>"Yes, yes, Toshi 
understands, even dim Toshi understands that much. But I nearly tried to stab you, and that 
probably would have been the end of Toshi --"</p><p>"Toshiiii! We've meant so much to each 
other --"</p><p>"Leave off! That's <i>my</i> pouch --"</p><p>"Just checking, seeing if there 
are any <i>billets doux</i> in here. If you've been unfaithful to me, lovebuns, I'll rip 
your nuts off. Ah! What have we here?"</p><p>Toshi finally succeeded in breaking her hold on 
his neck, skipped away, and crouched there in the alleyway, knife at the ready.</p><p>"Very 
nice linen, hmmm? Oh, with some lovely stitching too -- the characters 'Tsuji' and 'Fu.' I 
don't think I need to ask what that stands for. Isn't that nice? The man you were tailing 
gave you a present --"</p><p>Toshi whimpered.</p><p>"-- or, no, people don't ordinarily give 
you presents. Could you have picked his pocket? Or, possibly --"</p><p>She was upon him 
then, like a hawk stooping. She had him by the front of his shirt and was lifting him up, 
and up, and up, until his head struck the cornice of the house they'd been skulking by, with 
a dolorous clonk, followed by blurred vision. Toshi was trying to shout, but in his ears it 
sounded like squeaking. He seemed to hear the mad cries of ravens drawing near.</p><p>And 
this vicious foreign woman, her black cloak flapping about her like a raven's wings, her 
hands at his collar and her toothy smile burning itself into his eyes, trumpeted in his 
face, "Ah, now, could you have been fraternizing with the <i>enemy</i>, ducky? Fabulous! I 
wonder how your liver will taste?!"</p><p>Toshi squealed and beat at her hands, without 
apparent effect.</p><p>"Oh, do you <i>want</i> me to let you go? It's a bit of a drop, me 
dear old corn-fed piglet. Not fatal, necessarily, but you're courting at least a broken 
leg... That's better. Toshi, my lumpkin, I'm doing all the talking here. Considering that 
your chance of continuing your existence in the human form depends on your appeasing me, 
pleasing me with that crooked tongue of yours -- hah! -- well, don't you think you ought to 
be a <i>bit</i> more talkative?"</p><p>And so Toshi talked, in a rather high-pitched 
voice.</p><p>By the time he had finished, Sei had relented a little, and brought him back to 
street level, where he sat on a box, and though still trembling, he was talking in a more 
accustomed register.</p><p>"I see," Sei said, when he had done. "The usual sort of thing. Of 
course, this Shinji would want to avenge his aniki. Only natural." She smiled, and hummed to 
herself, her fingers working. She seemed to be intertwining bits of straw she'd taken out of 
her pocket, a bit of impromptu weaving -- it was the first time he'd seen her do anything 
remotely feminine, and that startled him, a little. She went on: "Though I <i>do</i> 
wonder... Didn't you tell me Shinji and his aniki had an entirely healthy terror of 
sorceresses?"</p><p>"Yes," Toshi said, "but I guess he's angry enough and in enough pain and 
fear that he's willing to take a risk. What's happened to his aniki is making him a little 
crazy. He wants to have <i>your</i> guts, your <i>friends'</i> guts, and even the guts of 
this Tsuji Fu, although --"</p><p>"And so you were going to lead me there and help him 
ambush me?"</p><p>"That's what I agreed with Shinji." An agreement he'd made somewhat 
against his will, but...</p><p>"That's what you <i>agreed</i>, eh? Was your hand even then 
going to be a stranger to your promise?"</p><p>"I know you," he said. "I know that even with 
me coming at you from behind by surprise, the two of us wouldn't be able to take you. It 
would be suicide. So I was going to skip out at the crucial moment --"</p><p>"Leaving Shinji 
to his fate?" Sei sighed. "You don't disappoint, Toshi old son. For sheer cold-blooded 
expediency, you are unparalleled."</p><p>"I am unworthy of your praise, strange foreign 
woman with scary teeth when she's mad. So, shall we?..."</p><p>"I think not." Sei seemed to 
have finished her odd little impromptu weaving job, and now she looked up from it at Toshi, 
unsmiling. The absence of a smile on that face, if anything, chilled him more than the smile 
had before, when she'd been about to drop him from a great height. He had always called her 
mad, a crazy foreigner, but for the first time now it occurred to him that she might really 
<i>be</i> mad, some way. He wondered how many of her friends saw this face she was showing 
him now, even while he began to wonder again whether he was going to survive this meeting. 
"You will take me to Shinji and Ichiki's dwelling place," she went on. "You will point it 
out to me from as far away as possible. I will pay you off. And then you will take a powder. 
I won't be requiring your services again today, or indeed ever."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Please 
lead the way, Toshi."</p><p>"But..." Toshi was at a loss. This madwoman had inconvenienced 
him more than once, he had often regarded her as a pestilence in his life, but the thought 
of never seeing her again was not a happy one, he didn't know why. "You don't believe me, 
that I wasn't going to help him?"</p><p>Sei sighed, and looked away, back toward the Market. 
There was a difference of opinion between a fish vendor and a customer which was on the 
verge of coming to blows; the thief and the sorceress were near enough to hear the music, 
but not the lyrics, of the dispute. The foreign woman watched them without avidity. She 
still wasn't smiling, but her face wasn't quite as dreadful. "Oh, I <i>believe</i> you, 
right enough. It certainly sounds like you. I may be as powerful as you say, Toshi, but I am 
also vulnerable. I have built my armor well, but even the best armor will have a chink in it 
somewhere big enough for a rat to pinch through't."</p><p>She looked back at Toshi, and he 
almost flinched back from <i>this</i> look; it was a frozen look and seemed to come from a 
very long way away. "It is simple folly to travel with such a creature in your pocket," she 
said softly. "And I promised myself long ago I wouldn't die stupid.</p><p>"Daylight's 
a-wasting, Tosh. Lead on."</p><p>Toshi rose, not looking at her, and led 
on.</p><p>--</p><p>Nijo Noriko, walking at the side of Hasekura Rei-sama, was both pleased 
and displeased with where she was. Pleased because the Mountain Lily Gang of Six was a 
notorious group and this was her first time working with them -- she hoped to make it the 
"Gang of Seven," if that wasn't presumptuous of her -- and displeased because Hasekura 
Rei-sama, whom she admired highly, seemed to be in a terrible mood, and Noriko was having to 
step very lightly around her. This was not at all the case, ordinarily. Ordinarily, the 
difficulty was to keep out of Hasekura-sama's lap. Hasekura-sama had a weakness for cute 
things. Noriko had always been cute, or she supposed she must have been, as people had been 
pinching her cheek and stroking her hair uninvited for as long as she could 
remember.</p><p>She had certainly never <i>objected</i> to being in Hasekura-sama's lap -- 
quite the reverse -- except that Shimazu Yoshino-san would split apart at the merest sight 
of it and assume her true form of nine flaming, shrieking harpies. How one little girl could 
contain nine harpies was a bit of a mystery to Nijo Noriko. Shimazu Yoshino-san was 
shockingly jealous over her tall, magnificent cousin. Noriko understood readily enough why 
Yoshino-san valued Hasekura-sama so highly, but didn't think that she -- Noriko! -- was 
really a threat to the Great Romance even from the proximity of Hasekura-sama's 
lap.</p><p>But something else <i>was</i> a threat to it, apparently. Noriko had not been 
privy to recent events, but understood that there had been some trouble and a bit of a scene 
in the palace gardens, and it seemed clear that Yoshino-san had broken faith with 
Hasekura-sama somehow. And here was the result: Hasekura-sama silent, thin-lipped, and 
occasionally having to be reminded of little things like where they were and what they were 
doing. Not that she was utterly useless, she just seemed to lose focus 
occasionally.</p><p>Noriko had briefly met this Yumi-san earlier in the afternoon, and she 
had seemed a likeable person, but Noriko hadn't spent enough time with her to be much help 
in tracing her, which meant that the success of their mission depended entirely upon 
Hasekura-sama, who would be searching these well-kept streets in the wealthiest quarter of 
Heian Kyo like a hawk a-hunting one moment, and pacing in one spot the next, absently biting 
a knuckle.</p><p>At last, Noriko decided that was about the limit. She stood in front of the 
distracted Dragon, hands on hips, glaring up at her, and waiting for her to 
notice.</p><p>Which she did, surprisingly fast. There were actual tears starting in 
Hasekura-sama's eyes as she said, "You... you remind me of Yoshino when you do that 
--"</p><p>"<i>Enough</i>, Hasekura-sama!" Noriko snapped.</p><p>"Enough 
what?..."</p><p>"Aren't you ashamed of all this dithering? This is a friend of yours we're 
looking for, isn't it? Aren't you concerned for her?"</p><p>"Of course I am," Hasekura-sama 
said tiredly. "Yumi-chan's a sweetheart. It's just that..."</p><p>"What happened with you 
and Yoshino-san?"</p><p>"Noriko-chan, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...well, I'd 
rather not discuss that with you..."</p><p>"Really? Oh, <i>goody</i>. Well, I don't want to 
hurt <i>your</i> feelings, but I don't want to discuss it at all, with anybody. Your 
problems with Yoshino-san are none of my business. But it seems you need to talk about it 
with someone, and I'm the only one here. Of course, you <i>could</i> just get yourself under 
control and apply yourself to the task at hand. I much prefer that 
option."</p><p>Hasekura-sama turned away, looking resolutely at the ground. "You can be such 
a pest, Noriko-chan, honestly..."</p><p>"Or, alternately, I could nip over to the northwest 
quarter and tell Mizuno-sama that you're having some unmanageable personal problems, and she 
can send someone over you <i>would</i> trust to help you with them."</p><p>That proud head 
turned slowly and Hasekura-sama was giving off an expressionless yet deadly glare which 
would have daunted a lesser Noriko. "Nijo-san, what are you trying to do, here?"</p><p>"Only 
get your mind onto something other than your cousin," Noriko answered cheerfully. "Is it 
working yet?"</p><p>Hasekura-sama managed to keep up the scary stare a few moments longer. 
Then she strolled over to a nearby bench, and sat on it. "No," she said. "But thank you for 
trying. Maybe you should go get Youko-sama after all --"</p><p>And Hasekura Rei-sama, better 
known as the General for her shining conduct at the Battle of Five Hills... began to 
<i>cry</i>.</p><p>Noriko stood glaring at her for a moment. Then she sighed, and went and 
sat beside her, and put an arm around her shoulders. Hasekura-sama collapsed the rest of the 
way. She buried her face in Noriko's shoulder, and soaked through four robes surprisingly 
quickly. She made very little noise about it. Noriko heard her sob once.</p><p>So, Noriko 
had to comfort her and build her back up. In fact, that made it quite easy, or at least 
known territory. Noriko was the sort of girl who could cope, and she had much experience 
performing this office, for many girls. She'd just never expected to have to perform it for 
the excellent Dragon sorceress and noted swordhand Hasekura Rei-sama. Well, you learned 
something new every day. "Don't cry, don't cry, Rei-sama. It's nothing that can't be fixed, 
is it?... Here, blow your nose. Are you ready to talk about it?..."</p><p>"Nothing to talk 
about," gasped Rei-sama. "She hates me and she's leaving me or I'll have to leave her so she 
can be happy and that's the end of it..."</p><p>"She doesn't hate you, and she's not leaving 
you, and I'd advise you not to break with her. That'll just make a bad situation worse." 
<i>She knows all this deep down,</i> Noriko thought. <i>She just needs to get the grief and 
pain out of her, and then she can be reasonable about it. I hope...</i> Noriko sent a 
fervent prayer to Kannon-sama.</p><p>"Really? You don't think she hates me?" Rei-sama asked, 
in a fragile way.</p><p>"Of course not, don't be silly --"</p><p>Rei-sama's face twisted in 
anger. "Well, what the HELL do you know?" And like that she was on her feet again, striding 
up and down before the bench.</p><p>"Rei-sama...please..."</p><p>"One night -- one blessed, 
blessed spring night -- we're together, clothed only in our room. We're sharing everything. 
<i>Everything</i>, do you understand? Our bodies and our souls. She's all the way in, in the 
center of me, where no one else has ever come. I no longer know where my body ends and hers 
begins, and it no longer matters. We are <i>one</i>. Do you hear? One body, and one 
spirit."</p><p>"If you say so." Noriko was tough, but she almost flinched back from 
Rei-sama's angry, wet, pale face and burning eyes.</p><p>"And it's happening the same for 
her, I'm all the way in the center of her, I <i>know</i> I am. Or I thought I knew... And 
then, the next day, in front of everybody, she runs off with a brace of bloody boys, and 
does goodness only knows what with them where no one can see, a dark place, furtive, groping 
--"</p><p>"Should they have done that in front of everybody too?"</p><p>Rei-sama stopped her 
pacing and stared at Noriko. "What!"</p><p>"Should they have run off when there was no one 
to see, and done their groping in front of everybody?"</p><p>There was a pregnant 
pause.</p><p>Then Rei-sama said, "You're actually a pretty cold person, aren't you, 
Noriko-chan?"</p><p>"You should make up your mind which you want, is all I'm saying. Next 
you'll be demonically furious because they touched each other halfheartedly in front of two 
or three people."</p><p>"I'm not in a humor for these winsome jests just now. Do you have 
anything <i>helpful</i> to say?"'</p><p>"Rei-sama, you are a romantic, and Yoshino-san is 
not."</p><p>"Wh-what?" Rei-sama seemed all off-balance once more.</p><p>"Not particularly 
helpful, but the best I can do right now."</p><p>Rei-sama sat back on the bench, very 
carefully. She was not looking at Noriko, for the moment. "Are you saying... she doesn't 
love me?"</p><p>Noriko rolled her eyes. "A <i>true</i> romantic, to the end. If someone 
doesn't love the way <i>you</i> love, then it isn't really love they're feeling. Rei-sama, 
for all your sternness in battle, and your practicality in Guild matters, you're a dreamer 
at heart, aren't you?... and Yoshino-san is not. You've read too many romances, and believed 
them, is what it amounts to. You believe that two people can dream the same dream. And they 
can, but because they're two different people, they're not going to dream it in the same 
way. Yoshino-san loves you. A person need only speak your name in her presence to know that. 
When you spend time with other girls, she becomes furious. When she spends time with other 
girls, or especially with boys, you sulk, and mope, and consume. Oh, you probably think of 
it as sorrowful ardor, suffering in decorous silence, or some such --"</p><p>"Yes!" Rei-sama 
said, surprised.</p><p>"But it's <i>moping</i>," Noriko finished firmly, with a hard look at 
Rei-sama. "Hard to say which is worse. When you mope, it's bad for you. When she's furious, 
it's bad for everybody else. You love each other, in different ways. So it's wrong of you to 
expect her to share your romanticism, just as it's wrong of her to expect you to share her 
all-embracing practicality. She understands your kind of love, but because she's never 
experienced it herself, she's impatient with it at times, thinks you're being over-dramatic, 
wasting her time with nonsense. But from that to saying she doesn't love you is as much to 
say -- oh -- for example, that because ocean-water isn't sweet like water from the Kamo, it 
isn't really water. It has to be water <i>your way</i>, or not at all. Do you 
see?"</p><p>Rei-sama was looking at Noriko with her mouth slightly open. "Noriko-chan... how 
do you know all this?"</p><p>"I don't. I'm just guessing."</p><p>"Noriko-chan!"</p><p>"No, I 
really am just guessing. It's an informed guess, from knowing the two of you, watching you. 
When two people love and argue with one another so publicly, it's hard not to come to some 
conclusion about them. But you can't ever really <i>know</i> what happens inside another 
person -- not without using magic, and that's cheating, isn't it?... You can make a pretty 
good guess based on her outrageous behavior, and that's about it."</p><p>Rei-sama continued 
to look at Noriko, almost in admiration. Then she said, "Why have I never asked you about 
this before, Noriko-chan?"</p><p>"Because I'm younger than you, and too cute to be really 
bright."</p><p>Rei-sama seemed taken aback. "Oh. Um. Right." She looked around them, taking 
a real interest in their surroundings for what seemed like the first time that afternoon. 
<i>This is promising,</i> Noriko thought. "I want to talk to you more later, Noriko-chan. I 
think you're smarter than I am about things like this, and you might be able to help me. But 
we're wasting time at the moment... How did we get onto East Konoe Street?"</p><p>"I'm not 
sure of that myself, Rei-sama."</p><p>"When last seen, Yumi-chan was heading south from a 
point south and west of where we are now. This neighborhood isn't my best guess for her to 
flee to..." Rei-sama stood.</p><p>"How are we going to look for her?"</p><p>"I was hoping to 
avoid this..." Rei-sama sighed, and took a square of linen out of the pouch at her side. 
"Yumi-chan didn't own this long enough for it to be the most helpful object imaginable, but 
one makes do." She handed it to Noriko.</p><p>"But what are you going to --" Noriko gasped 
and turned away.</p><p>Rei-sama was undressing!...</p><p>Noriko stood there, staring firmly 
away, eastward down the street, her left hand over her mouth, her right hand clutching the 
linen to her breast, which was pounding. She felt herself going pink at the thought of 
Rei-sama gradually becoming naked behind her. Oh, she hoped this didn't get around. <i>If 
Yoshino-san hears about it, I might not live to see the Sun Gorge.</i> "Rei-sama, what are 
you <i>doing</i> --"</p><p>"Sorry to be so abrupt." Rei-sama's voice was firm, if a bit 
strained with the chore of undressing. "But I've wasted too much precious time as it is. 
Thank you for bringing me to my senses, Noriko-chan. Now, we must cast <i>aside</i> these 
trammels of civilization -- these damned useless, pretty bits of nothing we use to conceal 
our true selves --"</p><p>Noriko squeaked.</p><p>"-- and come face to face with our 
<i>animal nature</i>. We are animals, you know, Noriko-chan. Can you doubt 
it?"</p><p>"Rei-sama, <i>please!</i>" Noriko wailed. She was more frightened than she'd ever 
been in her life. She was beginning to cry.</p><p>"Time to shed, like a locust husk, this 
nothing woman, this Hasekura who is so easily wounded, so easily cast down, and EMBRACE THE 
BEAST!"</p><p>Noriko screamed and whirled, fists raised, ready to use the most terrible 
defensive spells she knew, no longer caring what she might see --</p><p>She saw a large 
golden dog, and a small pile of neatly folded clothing.</p><p>"What?" said the 
dog.</p><p>Noriko stared at it. "Rei-sama?" she said warily.</p><p>"Of course. Who 
else?"</p><p>"But you -- I thought you were going to --"</p><p>"Going to <i>what</i>?" 
Rei-sama's, or the dog's, ears were perked, and she, it, was giving Noriko an annoyed, 
impatient look. With a dog's face. Somehow.</p><p>Noriko decided that it would be a bad idea 
to embark on the subject of what she had thought Rei-sama was going to do. So all was -- 
reasonably -- well, after all. Just as well, because now she thought about it, the most 
terrible defensive spells she knew weren't actually that terrible. "Um, never mind. I think 
I just got hysterical for a moment. Probably the heat."</p><p>"<i>What</i> heat? It's early 
spring."</p><p>"I --"</p><p>"Noriko-chan, do we really have <i>more</i> time to waste like 
this? Hold the linen out."</p><p>"What?" Noriko was having difficulty with all this, still. 
She was talking to a dog. The dog was Rei-sama. The dog was like a bristling, golden, 
grinning robe Rei-sama was wearing -- or had she truly <i>become</i> the dog? --</p><p>"The 
linen I <i>gave</i> you. So I can <i>smell</i> it. Unless <i>you</i> want to do the 
tracing." Over-elaborate patience. From a <i>dog</i>... A beautiful, adorable golden 
dog...</p><p>Noriko held out the linen, and Rei-pochi sniffed it a moment. "There, there. 
Sorry if I was short with you, young 'un. Mmm, better than I thought." Rei-pochi wagged her 
tail. "Come on, then. Second Street. All along the southern edge of the Enclosure. We're 
bound to pick up her scent somewhere there! Keep the linen handy in case I need it 
again!"</p><p>"Yes, Rei-pochi," Noriko agreed dreamily.</p><p>"Didn't quite catch that," 
Rei-pochi said distractedly, trotting away.</p><p>"Yes, Rei-sama," Noriko corrected herself. 
She collected Rei-sama's clothing, which Rei-pochi seemed to have forgotten about, and ran 
to catch up. <i>Don't leave me behind, beautiful Rei-pochi!</i></p><p>"Fine, fine. Ruf. An 
excellent day for hunting. Ah, I'll break that damned rabbit's <i>neck</i> when I catch 
her!..."</p><p>"We're not after a rabbit, Rei-sama. We're after Yumi-san."</p><p>"Of course 
we are, of course we are. Didn't I say? Don't distract me, baby darling." Rei-sama nuzzled 
Noriko's hand briefly and kept on trotting.</p><p>"I'll... try not to, Rei-sama. Rei-sama, 
are you still upset about Yoshino-san?"</p><p>The dog looked perplexed. "What's a 
'Yoshino-san'? Is it good eating?"</p><p>"Well, it's someone you love very 
much."</p><p>"Like a puppy?"</p><p>"A little... more like a... mate?"</p><p>"Oh, 
<i>mates</i>? That's all human nonsense. Find 'em and forget 'em, that's my 
motto."</p><p>"Yes... yes, I see," Noriko said, running faster to match the new pace 
Rei-sama was setting. Perhaps dogs had it simpler, after all. Beautiful, beautiful golden 
dogs; short golden hair everywhere except where it grew long over her paws; wonderfully 
alert, expressive ears; a friendly, engaging dog grin... <i>baby darling...</i> In a way, it 
was a pity she would have to change back later...</p><p>--</p><p>Shinji had been busy. 
Perhaps Toshi was more trustworthy than he looked, but in the end, Shinji had decided not to 
count on the little rat. He'd done a setup that didn't exclude a third party, but wasn't 
dependent on one either. It seemed the best way. It had been a lot of work, tearing away the 
planks of the porch and removing the support struts in key places, and making the 
<i>arrangement</i> just under it, an arrangement reminiscent of his poaching days, before 
Aniki had taken him on... no, mustn't cry now...</p><p>Anyway. Beneath the porch, the Mouth 
waited.</p><p>And Shinji waited, in the dark front room of their dwelling. He was sure it 
would be today. He gripped his weapon, but had the sense to wipe it occasionally, so that 
his own sweat wouldn't make him lose his grip. He was in a strange place, a come-to-a-point, 
squeezed-up-tight place. Chances were excellent he'd be dead within five minutes after the 
sorceress turned up. (<i>Unless the sorceress is in a mood to draw things out,</i> he 
thought, and then tried to sponge the thought away, as the phrase "draw things out" gave 
rise to unfortunate mental images. Shinji was cursed with a rather visual imagination.) 
There were a great many things about life he was no longer thinking about, or looking at, 
because they had ceased to be important. All that was left was revenge for his aniki, his 
dying aniki. Ichiki-sama had sunk very low today, and Shinji was quite sure he wouldn't last 
until midnight.</p><p>He had warned all their neighbors away. The intelligence that a 
sorceress was coming to see him had been very effective in emptying out the neighborhood, 
though it had been difficult to have all those final conversations with those he'd counted 
friends as well as neighbors, his and Ichiki-sama's fellows: thieves, grifters, unsuccessful 
publicans, rejects. "Are you <i>mad</i>, Shinji?" "If a sorceress is really coming, then why 
are you <i>staying?</i>" "Flee with us, while there's time!" He'd thanked them all for their 
concern, but had told them, "My course is set, and I can see the end of my path. I owe it to 
my aniki to face his killer." Old Keiko the Witch had called him "a blithering young idiot." 
Well, perhaps he was, but he was a blithering young idiot with a mission. He owed it to his 
poor dying aniki to stick it to his killer just as hard as he could, before she impaled him 
with a tongue of flame and burst him so that his guts spilled out. She would probably eat 
his guts as well, or at least pickle them for later use in her wicked craft. The defilement 
of it was past bearing, but Shinji would just have to bear it somehow. He wiped a tear away 
irritably. He would be dead, after all. Perhaps he would be unaware of --</p><p>"Shinji? Oi! 
Fair Shinji? Step forth, my lovely. The sun is setting, and the evening star sings in the 
glorious deep blue."</p><p>She was here! She was talkative. Shinji would give her some 
talking. Oh indeed he would. She was just a few feet from where he crouched in shadow just 
inside the door, by the sound, still in the dust of the street. He just needed her to 
--</p><p>"-- step forward."</p><p><i>-- a little. Just step forward a little 
--</i></p><p>"-- onto the porch."</p><p><i>-- just step forward a little onto the porch, 
that's all you need to... do...</i></p><p>"Shinji, my devious young architect, I've no wish 
to be rude at all, but your porch is rigged, and I ain't stepping on it."</p><p>"You read my 
<i>mind!</i>" It just burst out of him. He couldn't help it. "It isn't 
<i>fair!</i>"</p><p>"Shinji. I can <i>see</i> there's something wrong with the porch. She 
lists to starboard, and the planks in front of the door have clearly been ripped up and 
hastily reinstalled in the very recent past. I didn't read <i>your</i> mind, I just used my 
own. What did you put under it, Shinji? Spikes? Or possibly it's something that's supposed 
to grab my legs so I can't dodge when you hit me with whatever it is you're holding, a 
simple slip-knot arrangement perhaps, pulled tight by my weight --"</p><p>"You're reading my 
mind <i>again!</i>" Shinji howled. He clutched his hair with his free hand.</p><p>"Now, if I 
were reading your mind, like it was a bloody scroll, don't you think I'd be able to see what 
was in your hand?"</p><p>Shinji squinched his eyes tight shut at that. This was like being 
hit over and over. And he didn't want to pull his hair any more; his scalp hurt. "Then how 
did you <i>know</i> I had something in my hand?!"</p><p>"Well, the odds of your attacking me 
barehanded aren't good. You'd have something, even if it was just a stick. I bet you've got 
something better, though, resourceful young limb of Satan that you are. What has he got, 
Shimako?"</p><p>Shinji was upside down suddenly, and his head smacked against the floor. He 
screamed, and lost his grip on the weapon. Then he felt as if he was a kite being flown in a 
typhoon. Then he was in a tumbled heap in a corner.</p><p>A new voice, another woman, in the 
room with him, said, "He has a sword, Sei. It's a bit rusty, and the balance isn't good. It 
has a large, obviously fake ruby set in its pommel."</p><p>And now, the bitch queen 
murderess's voice, also in the room all of a sudden. "You disappoint me, Shinji. An ordinary 
sword?"</p><p>Shinji struggled out of the tangle of his own limbs -- up to a standing 
position -- if he had to die, he was going to die on his feet -- "How did you get in here 
without stepping on the boards? You <i>cheated!</i>"</p><p>He had half expected monsters, 
inhuman creatures with six breasts each and leading vengeful ghosts on leashes. Instead 
there were two women, one in a rather plain white robe and hakama, and the other, taller one 
in some outlandish skin-tight gear, black legs and padded golden breast, with a sort of 
black half-cloak, and a mop of yellow hair, obviously a foreigner, but not supernatural. 
They were both looking at him in wonder.</p><p>Shinji ran at the taller one. He knew this 
was the end, and he probably wouldn't make it across half the distance between them, but 
this was how he would die, he would die <i>fighting</i>, he owed it to --</p><p>The typhoon 
effect was repeated.</p><p>But he ended up face down on the floor with a hand on his back 
between his shoulderblades, and a bumped nose, instead of on a spike with his own wet guts 
landing on his face, as he had expected.</p><p>"Shinji," said the voice of the taller 
sorceress, "you are relentlessly hostile. Perhaps I have earned it, but I'd like to talk to 
you calmly and quietly, as one professional to another. Will you stand up in a peaceable 
fashion, instead of flying at me like a deranged grasshopper, and can we try to have some 
kind of adult relationship?"</p><p>...Shinji had no idea what was going on. His hopes for 
this encounter were all destroyed, but so were his <i>fears</i>.</p><p>On an experimental 
basis, he said, "All right."</p><p>The hand was removed from his back, and he was being 
helped up.</p><p>He stood there, rubbing his nose and the back of his head, and looking at 
his guests. The taller one still had that smile, which he was beginning to think might be 
friendly rather than sardonic. The smaller one merely had a sweet, relaxed expression. She 
had a calming effect on him; he suddenly felt certain that nothing too terrible could happen 
to him with this one around; she had a face that wouldn't allow anyone to be unjustly 
murdered and boiled, with his own innards, in a bag. "I, er, apologize for my violent 
behavior, which surprisingly turns out to be unwarranted," he said, bowing.</p><p>"Don't 
<i>worry</i> about it, Shinji," said the taller one. "You're upset, naturally. Your aniki is 
wounded. Is he dying? Toshi seemed to think so."</p><p>"I don't think he'll make it through 
the night," Shinji said. And then he did begin to cry. He couldn't stop himself. All the 
desperate stratagems of planning and revenge he had put between himself and the death were 
gone now --</p><p>He turned away from the women and sat on the floor. This was shameful. He 
couldn't speak; he couldn't trust his voice.</p><p>He heard the inner door slide a 
little.</p><p>"This is him in here? On the pallet, sleeping?" the taller voice asked 
him.</p><p>He turned his head just enough so they could see him nod. He wanted to apologise 
and he couldn't even do that right now.</p><p>"Hmmm. Not my <i>forte</i>, really," the 
taller voice said, somewhat muted. "Shimako, I believe you're pretty 
skilled?"</p><p>"Reasonably, for ox-level," the smaller voice answered. "My Mistress is a 
close friend of the best healer in the Guild, after all. I think I could <i>comprehend</i> 
such a wound -- such a degeneration in the tissues, such a depletion of the humours -- but I 
don't know if I have the power to reverse it all."</p><p>"Then we will collaborate. Abide a 
little, Shinji."</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Shinji stood. He turned and went to the inner 
door.</p><p>The two women were kneeling on the floor, to either side of Ichiki-sama. Their 
hands rested gently on his belly, his chest, his forehead. The younger one's eyes were 
closed. Shinji couldn't see the older one's face, her back was to him.</p><p>Shinji waited 
in the doorway. There was a lump in his throat. He was telling himself firmly, over and 
over, not to hope.</p><p>The younger woman spoke:</p><p>The hollow tree holds<br>A letter 
from a loved one.<br>Moonlit paper glows.<br>Warm sad thoughts. When the hole is<br>Closed, 
leave the letter inside.</p><p>Ichiki-sama's hand twitched.</p><p>Shinji found that he had 
bitten his knuckles hard enough to make them bleed. Stifling a curse, he rushed back into 
the front room to dress it.</p><p>When he came back in, Ichiki-sama's eyes were open. He was 
talking to the sorceresses with some hoarseness, but intelligibly. "That was my death blow. 
I was sure of it."</p><p>"I was the one who dealt it to you," the older sorceress answered, 
"so it was only right I help with the healing."</p><p>"<i>Am</i> I healed?"</p><p>"You 
should rest for a few days," the younger sorceress said very seriously. "It was a near 
thing. Healing is best applied to a wound as soon as possible after the wound happens. It 
was late for you, almost too late. You should be all right, though, as long as you don't go 
right back into your routine."</p><p>"Right now, I feel about strong enough to eat some rice 
lees and fall asleep..." Ichiki-sama looked up at Shinji, who was standing over them now, 
holding a bowl of rice lees and a dipper of water. "Just the thing," Ichiki-sama went on. 
"This foolish and incompetent young man is my student. He has not much in the way of charm, 
grace, or talent, but he is devoted enough, and understands his duty. I hope he has not 
disgraced himself in any way?"</p><p>"Not at all," the older sorceress answered him. "We had 
a misunderstanding at first, but cleared it up quickly enough. He <i>is</i> very devoted, 
and I think he's more talented than you give him credit for."</p><p>"He had better be," 
Ichiki-sama growled. "Are you going to feed me that lees, boy, or watch it dry?"</p><p>The 
older sorceress rose, and Shinji knelt in her place. The younger sorceress raised 
Ichiki-sama's head in her lap. Shinji fed and watered his aniki. There were tears in 
Shinji's eyes, but he was barely aware of them. Inside he felt quite calm, and content. The 
world was the right shape again.</p><p>After Ichiki-sama fell asleep, Shinji served the 
sorceresses the last of his sake in the front room. They honored him with their names, and 
he told them a little of his history, and Ichiki-sama's.</p><p>"I am only a simple thief," 
he said. "But you have laid a great obligation upon me, and if there is any service I might 
do you, you need only name it."</p><p>"I wounded Ichiki-san in the first place," Satou-san 
said. "Only right I should help heal him. But there is a favor you can do me, 
Shinji-san."</p><p>"Anything --"</p><p>"Tsujimoto no Fujito."</p><p>Shinji looked down. 
"Perhaps I was over-hasty... Toshi-san said you were looking for that one. I think 
Ichiki-sama wouldn't like me to. Mind, if it were only me, I'd tell you anything you wanted 
to know. I have no use for the high-and-mighty bastard. But..."</p><p>"You and Ichiki-san 
were in some sort of partnership with him? That much seems obvious, from the way we met you 
fellows."</p><p>"Yes. Still <i>are</i> in a partnership..."</p><p>"Not unless you mean to 
join him in exile," Sei said. "Tsujimoto no Fujito is done, like dinner. He was captured in 
the Imperial Enclosure a little while ago."</p><p>"What! Really?"</p><p>"Truly. Actually, I 
don't know what they mean to do with him. I think the punishment for breaking banishment is 
death --" Satou-san looked at Todo-san, who inclined her head once -- "but I don't know what 
sort of favors the pipsqueak can call in. He has at least one friend that I know of, who has 
the ear of the Emperor. But at the very least, I'd guess he's going back into 
exile."</p><p>Shinji was most pleased by this intelligence. He hoped that Tsuji-chan was in 
serious trouble.</p><p>"But he's not so much the one I'm interested in," Satou-san went on. 
"It's the girl, the beggar-girl. The one he sent up into our rooms in the Mountain Lily 
Inn."</p><p>The girl? How was she of any importance?... "Yes?..."</p><p>"How did he happen 
to find her?"</p><p>--</p><p>The young sorceresses had been in chaos, when Sachiko had found 
them in the Banqueting Pine Grove. Shrieking, excitement. A few were still in tears, though 
not many. There were some loud ones saying Satou-san ought to be disciplined, and some 
quieter ones looking miserable and tugging at the sleeves of the loud ones. No one could 
talk for long without being interrupted, but the main subject of discourse seemed to be what 
punishment would be appropriate for such an outrage. Oe Hikaru-san was saying that 
banishment to the frozen north was the only way to go.</p><p>Sachiko had held up her hands 
and spoken to them for a few moments, telling them it was time to return to the dormitories. 
She had touched briefly on the need for the Guild to maintain proper decorum in public 
places, but did not stress the point.</p><p>The girls and young women trooped quietly after 
her in the streets.</p><p>A few citizens bowed as they passed, but the custom was falling 
into disuse. "A sign of the coming collapse, when old ways are so flouted," Suga-sama would 
cry. "Even if you could force people to reverence you," Fujiwara-dono would answer, "would 
it be a kind of reverence worth having?"</p><p>Sachiko didn't know which of them was right. 
She suspected both of them were.</p><p>After she'd turned the junior sorceresses over to the 
Matron of the Day, her progress back to the Mountain Lily Inn was slow. She kept looking 
into every corner, every shadow, for anything Yumi-shaped, however small. She was examining 
beggars and street people much more closely than was her wont.</p><p><i>Where are you, 
Yumi?</i></p><p><i>Come home. Please come home --</i></p><p>She was looking off into an 
alleyway, and she almost bumped into the flower girl.</p><p>"Flowers, your ladyship, only a 
few --"</p><p>Sachiko looked, and saw the face of the flower girl she'd met the day before 
yesterday, and given the rough side of her tongue, almost in this exact spot.</p><p>The 
flower-girl's eyes widened as she recognised the scary lady from the day before yesterday. 
She froze in terror.</p><p>The terror would probably have broken in another moment, and been 
followed by a mad dash for safety. But the scary lady got down on her haunches and said, in 
a non-scary way, "Let me see your flowers."</p><p>Timidly, the flower girl extended one 
bunch. They weren't very <i>good</i> flowers, as she would have admitted if pressed. This 
early in the spring, the pickings weren't good, and these were wilting after a day of being 
held and shown and all. Nobody had bought anything, and she had begun to think of eating the 
flowers.</p><p>The scary lady said, "Oh, these are nice. How much?"</p><p>The flower girl 
thought she might get hit at any moment. The flowers clearly <i>weren't</i> nice. It would 
take a fool to think they were, and the scary lady did not smell like any kind of a fool. 
"J-just one copper, my lady --" The lady would surely think even one copper was overcharging 
for a few wilting wildflowers --</p><p>"I have no coin on me," the lady said. "But what do 
you think of these?"</p><p>The lady was holding out two rice-cakes. They were wrapped in 
leaves, which the lady had pulled back a bit. The cakes smelled of honey and sesame. The 
girl's mouth watered, and she gulped. She couldn't remember ever being offered that much 
food at once. "My lady?..."</p><p>"I had meant these for my dinner," the lady said, "but I 
can get something else at my inn. Go on and take them."</p><p>The girl had frozen in 
disbelief this time. Now there was a screaming in her head, <i>take them, fool!</i>, and she 
took them. Grabbed them, in fact, <i>snatched</i> them out of the lady's hands. The lady 
looked startled.</p><p>"S-sorry," the girl said. "I'm sorry, ladyship. Here's your flowers." 
She thrust the flowers out. It was only later that she thought about how rude she had been, 
to this kind, if mad, lady, and cringed.</p><p>The lady took the flowers very gently. "Thank 
you," she said. She even smelled them, and smiled. It was a very small, not very convincing 
smile. But it was a smile.</p><p>The girl was torn. She wanted to just stand there looking 
at this lady, and she wanted to run away. She thought maybe she ought to stay until she was 
dismissed, and that decided her.</p><p>"You yelled at me, the other day," she said, more or 
less at random, and then wondered if she should have mentioned it.</p><p>The lady looked at 
her, a calm, unreadable look. "I know. I'm sorry about that. I was angry at something 
someone had just told me. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. What's your 
name?"</p><p>"Kikuko," the girl said. She'd given her real name without thinking about it. 
Usually she told anyone who asked that she was Endo the Mad, the Emperor Godaigo, something 
ridiculous. But it seemed dangerous to speak an untruth to this lady.</p><p>"Kikuko-chan, I 
am Sachiko. A pleasure."</p><p>Kikuko bowed.</p><p>"Do you eat to your fill every day, 
Kikuko-chan?"</p><p>"Y -- no," Kikuko said uncomfortably.</p><p>"There isn't a family that 
could take you on, as a servant, a helper?..."</p><p>Kikuko pressed her lips together. She 
could take care of herself. She didn't need anybody. She was tough. Anyway, there was nobody 
to trust.</p><p>"How old are you, Kikuko-chan?"</p><p>"I could be eight... or nine..." 
Kikuko felt embarrassed. She didn't actually know. Neither of her parents was around to be 
asked.</p><p>The lady moved away from the subject. "I suppose that's old enough. Still, it 
is good to have people around you. I mean, if you get sick --"</p><p>"Don't need anybody!" 
Kikuko said too loudly. Then she ducked her head, abashed. She wasn't used to people taking 
an interest.</p><p>"I see," she heard the lady say. She sounded sad. "I see." She was quiet 
for a moment. Then, "Kikuko-chan, I have a friend who lives in the streets as you do. Her 
name is Yumi. She's older than you, but not quite as old as I; she is just reaching 
womanhood. She has brown hair. She's slender. Big brown eyes... almost as big as yours. When 
last seen, she was wearing a simple white tunic. She blushes easily, and if she's startled 
she makes strange sounds of distress like a baby dragon caught in a trap. She 
is..."</p><p>Kikuko, wondering what the sudden silence was about, looked up and saw, to her 
surprise, that there were tears in Lady Sachiko's eyes. "Your ladyship..."</p><p>Her 
ladyship looked away and looked back, and the tears were gone. Kikuko wondered if she'd 
imagined them. "I love her very much," her ladyship went on. Her voice was a little 
unsteady. "She was only with me for about a day, but... she is my joy. I suppose a mistress 
shouldn't love her famula, as Fujiwara-dono suggests, it's bad form, but I do love her and I 
want her to come home. I don't want to be a bore, but..."</p><p>Kikuko didn't know what to 
say.</p><p>"I don't suppose you've seen her anywhere, Kikuko-chan? Or a girl who could be 
her?" The forlorn hopefulness in those blue eyes...</p><p>"No, your ladyship," Kikuko said. 
Oh how she wished she could say yes. "I would tell you right away, if I did," she added 
impulsively.</p><p>"Thank you, Kikuko-chan." Lady Sachiko smiled again, and this time it was 
much more convincing. "If you do see her, could you bring word to me? I'm at the Mountain 
Lily Inn. Do you know where that is?"</p><p>"Between Ii-dono's palace, and the burnt grubbly 
bits over yonder," said Kikuko. "Past the wobbly thing. Yes, ladyship, I know 
it."</p><p>Lady Sachiko hesitated, still smiling, and then said, in a more businesslike 
tone, "Even if you don't see her -- stop by sometimes anyway. I'm on the second floor, 
southwest corner, if you just want to climb up."</p><p>"I don't --" Kikuko growled and 
looked away.</p><p>"You'd rather take care of yourself. I understand that. Look, think of me 
as a fallback. If your usual ways of getting food aren't working, then stop by. I should be 
able to find you something... No?... Well, the offer stays open."</p><p>Kikuko felt a gentle 
touch on her shoulder. The lady Sachiko was standing. "I have to go now, Kikuko-chan," she 
said. "Thank you for talking to me."</p><p>Kikuko remembered her obligation -- the smell of 
it was filling her whole head and making her a bit dizzy. "Thank you for the rice cakes, 
your ladyship. I hope you find your friend, your ladyship." <i>Thank you for talking to me, 
your ladyship. Thank you for...</i></p><p>"I hope so too, Kikuko. I wish you good luck for 
the rest of your day."</p><p>Kikuko watched her ladyship go. Down the street. She thought it 
was just her ladyship's dignity that made her go so slow -- her ladyship was a young woman 
after all -- but then she noticed that her ladyship was constantly glancing away, in this 
direction or that. At the mouth of Hell's Ditch, she stopped and looked away west along that 
stretch of sheds, shacks, skins stretched over sticks, her eyes sad and 
searching.</p><p><i>No one has ever looked for me that way, and no one ever will,</i> Kikuko 
thought. The thought made her feel wild and happy, and then it made her feel like 
crying.</p><p>Making sure her bundle of leaves, and their precious contents, were securely 
tied under her arm, she trotted down to the place where Lady Sachiko had stood, went into 
Hell's Ditch, and began to make for her secret fort. She chose an unconcerned, half-walking, 
half-skipping gait, in case she was spotted by anyone she knew. She was taking the rest of 
the day off. These rice-cakes, one meal to her ladyship, were four meals to Kikuko. Though 
probably one of the cakes would end up being money instead of food. There was something she 
wanted to try...</p><p>Sachiko arrived at the Inn. She went to the kitchen, calmly. She 
calmly requested a simple meal from the innkeeper's daughter, Miyo. Miyo-san seemed to sense 
that something was wrong; her eyes kept searching Sachiko's face. Sachiko ignored this as 
politely as possible. She appreciated Miyo-san's concern, but she didn't want to talk just 
now.</p><p>She climbed the ladder to the suite.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>She 
stood looking at the empty room for a moment. She hadn't expected, but she <i>had</i> 
hoped...</p><p>She got on with the rest of her day:</p><p>She found a nice vase to put the 
wilting, scrawny wildflowers in. <i>These aren't worth half of one of those rice cakes, and 
you are a fool,</i> she seemed to hear her mother's voice saying. Well, perhaps. Perhaps. 
Her high-born parents seemed to want nothing from her but her obedience. If she wanted to 
ignore them as much as possible, and hold an uneducated beggar, two serving-girls, and a 
grinning unreliable hedge-wizard to her heart all the rest of her days, who knew what 
anything was worth? Not Sachiko. She had learned more in the last few years of her life than 
in all the years that had come before them, and she was now, at last, prepared to admit that 
she knew next to nothing after all. She put her head down on the kotatsu. Her hands clasped 
at the vase.</p><p>She wept.</p><p>People of her class generally approved of weeping; it was 
how you demonstrated that you were capable of fine and poetic feeling. To Sachiko, it had 
always seemed like one more contrivance, as well as a waste of energy -- energy that might 
more sensibly be used to alleviate the very cause of the tears, to your own benefit, and 
perhaps the benefit of others. But she had not known she was going to weep before she 
started, it was like a storm that had taken her unawares, and it was the first time she had 
done anything spontaneously, so far as she remembered, since childhood, and so she decided 
to let it run its course. Through her misery, she laughed a little weak laughter at her 
careful self-analysis 'mid such a spontaneous act, but the misery quickly took over 
again.</p><p>In time, her sobs were tearing at her, robbing her of breath, and then, with no 
volition of which she was aware, she screamed:</p><p>"YUMI!..."</p><p>After that, the sobs 
faded, the tears slowed.</p><p>She looked up at the vase she still was clutching and saw, to 
her mild surprise, that the flowers were standing straight, seemed bigger than before, and 
were blooming furiously, almost viciously.</p><p><i>Hm. I didn't tell them to do 
that.</i></p><p>Oh, well. There would be some nice flowers to welcome Yumi and the others 
home, when they came.</p><p>And Yumi <i>would</i> come home.</p><p>Outside, it began to 
rain.</p>
