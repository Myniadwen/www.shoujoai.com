<h1>The Rose That Blooms Alone</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I haven&#39;t watched Marimite in a while, and even if I had I don&#39;t think 
there was much mentioned about Youko&#39;s past or family situation, 
although I could be wrong. Either way, I have never read the manga or 
the novels, and even my recall of the anime isn&#39;t 100% at the moment, so 
I&#39;m just making things up to be the way I want them right now. There, 
I&#39;ve warned you. :D 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mizuno Youko was a meddler by nature. It was not, as some individuals 
that did not know her well might have suspected, a thing born from a 
need to manipulate others, oh no. Youko merely... cared. Too much and 
too compulsively at times, and because she was the kind of sophisticated 
and dignified young woman that she was, her concern for others most 
often found an outlet in her subtle &#150; or sometimes not so subtle, for 
those that were very close to Youko&#39;s heart &#150; machinations to pull other 
people towards what she perceived as their happiness. 

Watching other people achieve some measure of happiness was a source of 
wistful satisfaction for Youko, who knew well that her own chances of 
any real happiness were slim at best... one might even say nonexistent. 
Oh yes, Youko knew this, certainly. 

Born the sole successor of a family of some wealth and note her parents 
had raised her to meet all the expectations of her name, yet remained as 
distant to her as the many teachers and tutors that had moved through 
her life in her younger years. They had raised an heir, not a daughter, 
although Youko did not resent them for it. 

The compulsion to do well and rise to the expectations was deeply rooted 
within Youko by the time she entered school, and for each passing year 
the expectations became greater. She fulfilled them all, and in the 
process became well liked among her peers... yet had no real friends to 
speak of. Youko was simply too grown-up, too poised, and most of all, 
too revered, for her classmates to approach her casually.  

When the Rosa Chinensis en bouton had approached Youko at the beginning 
of her stint as a first year Youko had been flattered and somewhat 
grateful for the attention. When she had been offered the rosary of the 
Chinensis family, Youko had not been surprised... it had been easy to 
see the similarities between the two Chinensis members and herself, and 
she had known she would perform well in Yamayurikai. Youko had been the 
first to join the Yamayurikai that year, her age-mates Eriko and Sei not 
joining them until some time later. 

While Youko respected and liked her oneesama, and of course the Rosa 
Chinensis at the time, there had never been any stronger emotional bond 
between them. It had not mattered; Youko had been grateful and made sure 
to honour her oneesama as was proper, and to fulfil all her Yamayurikai 
duties to the fullest. If it were not for one particular person Youko 
would perhaps not even have realised that she had been missing something 
emotionally, much less lived to experience these things for herself. 

The Rosa Gigantea en bouton at the time had spoken for a while of 
getting a petite soeur of her own, while Youko and Eriko were both 
already members of Yamayurikai, and had decided on a particular, by her 
own description, unruly child for the position. One day the impossibly 
tall woman had just waltzed in, an insolent smirk on her comely 
features, with a tall, scowling and pouting blue-eyed blonde in a firm 
grip. She had introduced the girl as Satou Sei, to which Sei had merely 
grunted in the direction of the rest of the room, then sat down to stare 
at her crossed feet for the rest of the meeting. The newly minted 
oneesama had merely watched her new petite soeur and grinned, leaving 
the rest of them slightly bewildered what to make of the newcomer. 

Well, the rest of the Yamayurikai perhaps, but not Youko. Youko had 
taken one look at the pouting vision of Satou Sei and felt her stomach 
do strange and dizzying flips. It was a reaction that bewildered her at 
the time, and that would accompany every encounter with the lanky Sei 
for quite a while. 

Sei had, when she had been made a petite soeur, been surly and 
distrusting of others, prickly about many things, especially her 
appearance and anything that could even remotely be considered a 
reference to her being half-Japanese. But with the camaraderie of the 
Yamayurikai, the easygoingness of her oneesama, and the acceptance and 
even friendship offered by Eriko and Youko, Sei relaxed her attitude 
over time. Soon enough it was easy to see an almost true familial 
resemblance between Sei and her oneesama, with similar roguish easygoing 
smiles and flirtatious nature. 

The first time Youko had been the recipient of that wide roughish smile 
and a flirtatious wink, it had left her breathless and with a fluttering 
heart. Years later, Youko had still not recovered from the effects of 
Sei&#39;s charming smile. 

By the time Youko had realised the cause for her strange reactions to 
Sei, and self-examination had made her reach the inevitable conclusion 
regarding her feelings for the tall blonde, Youko, Sei and Eriko were 
all already second years. By then it was already too late. 

Encouraged by Eriko, whom had realised the nature of Youko&#39;s feelings 
towards Sei perhaps even before Youko did, Youko prepared how to best 
approach Sei with the matter of her heart. A final pep-talk from Eriko 
had given Youko courage, and she had set out to catch up to Sei in an 
out-of-sight spot beyond the church were she felt sure Sei would be, 
alone. 

Youko had almost reached Sei, already raised her hand in greeting, Sei&#39;s 
name already forming on her lips when... she saw her.  

Long dark hair swaying with some private breeze as she strode gracefully 
directly towards Sei, dark eyes never leaving the blonde. And Sei, 
Sei... saw nothing else, knew nothing else, as Kubo Shiori smiling 
walked right up to her and into her arms with an ease that told Youko it 
was far from the first time. 

Then the two kissed. And Youko&#39;s heart... shattered. 

She made her way back unseen, somehow, not shedding a single tear until 
she fell into the arms of the badly startled Eriko where she sobbed with 
a near-hysterical desperation that would never be repeated. Eriko&#39;s 
first reaction as she awkwardly tried to comfort Youko was to locate her 
other friend and give her a good and unladylike thumping. In the face of 
Eriko&#39;s indignation on her behalf Youko found the words to express the 
attitude towards Sei that she would then follow for the duration of her 
remaining school years at Lillian: Youko would hope for Sei&#39;s happiness, 
and not interfere. 

It took a few days, but eventually Youko regained enough poise not to be 
reduced to tears at the thought of Sei, and fortunately Sei&#39;s presence 
was scarce around the Yamayurikai at this time. Eriko abandoned her stab 
at anger, as well, and during this time chose her petite soeur, Hasekura 
Rei. Encouraged by Eriko once more, Youko focused her attention on 
finding the one first-year student that would fit the Chinensis name one 
day. 

She found her quickly, a simple glance into a classroom was really all 
Youko needed to know that she had found her petite soeur, although she 
did do all the proper research before actually approaching the girl. 
Ogasawara Sachiko was a young swan among the ducklings, and one glance 
at the girl, her regal bearing, her aloof concentration, and the almost 
tangible distance between her and the other girls that even then were 
staring at Sachiko in admiration, and Youko knew this girl would one day 
be a Rosa Chinensis. 

When Sachiko accepted Youko&#39;s rosary she would also bring a treasured 
source of joy to the latter&#39;s life. In Sachiko Youko found a soul 
surprisingly similar to her own in some ways, and someone who needed 
her, someone who not only brought out but also accepted the mothering 
tendencies in Youko, and Youko loved her deeply and dearly. Sachiko 
responded to Youko&#39;s love with her own, and a deep sense of admiration 
and respect that was humbling at first, before Youko learned to just 
accept it. It was not a romantic love between them, in any sense, 
instead it felt as if Youko truly had been gifted with a blood sister 
after all this time. 

Doting on Sachiko in the various ways Youko did to help the girl grow 
more comfortable in her own skin was a source of peace, even if Youko 
was not above challenging Sachiko&#39;s hidden temper for her own good upon 
occasion, something to hold on to in a time when Youko badly needed just 
that. 

Sei was never around, and not even the summons of her oneesama, the Rosa 
Gigantea, would keep Sei&#39;s presence at the Yamayurikai meetings for 
long. The two first-year additions to the group had barely seen Sei in 
her capacity as Rosa Gigantea en bouton, and Sachiko developed a kind of 
instinctive dislike for the tall girl whom appeared to shirk her 
responsibilities completely and, more offensive still, made Sachiko&#39;s 
oneesama have the fleeting sad expression at times. 

The Rosa&#39;s finally made a joint decision to step in once rumours and 
Sei&#39;s negligence had just gone too far. They tried the logic approach, 
they tried arguing. They even tried the impassionate plea from Sei&#39;s 
oneesama, but it was to no avail. 

Sei for some reason simply would not make Shiori her petite soeur, and 
while Shiori was not present at the Yamayurikai meetings, neither would 
Sei. 

The Rosas shook their heads and sighed, Sei&#39;s oneesama voicing their 
fear: this would not end well. It took some while still before Youko 
found out what worried them all so about Kubo Shiori. 

No words could accurately describe the way Youko&#39;s own heart bled to 
walk out on the platform at that train station to see that proud, free 
spirit so utterly and cruelly broken by her faithless lover. To have 
Sei&#39;s love and throw it away... Youko could not understand Shiori&#39;s 
reasoning. Youko herself would have given anything, sacrificed anything 
she had, for Sei&#39;s heart. 

But Sei would never see her. 

Time passed and Sei bounced back, though never entirely the same as 
before, and somewhere during her worry for Sei, her unspoken love, her 
guidance of Sachiko and her efforts to keep Sei and Sachiko civil with 
one another &#150; as Sachiko never quite got over that smidgen of dislike 
she felt towards her senior, and Sei, perhaps sensing Sachiko&#39;s 
aversion, never missed an opportunity to try and tease Sachiko until her 
temper flared &#150; Youko found herself a third year and the Rosa Chinensis. 

The first of the new additions to the Yamayurikai was added already on 
the first day of the school year, although they would not get to 
actually be introduced to Shimazu Yoshino until a few days later, but 
since the subject of her cousin was the one thing Rei would inevitably 
veer off into regardless of the conversation, the rest of the 
Yamayurikai already felt as if they knew the girl somewhat. Rei even 
carried a picture in her wallet, and another in her weekly planner, of 
young Yoshino, it had been the subject of many disbelieving silences as 
it seemed everyone was aware of Rei&#39;s feelings for her cousin besides 
Rei herself. 

Then came the day that Toudou Shimako entered Sei&#39;s life, and from the 
other girl&#39;s attempts to hide her shell-shocked daze from Youko&#39;s 
watching eyes, Youko knew it was a significant encounter. Youko would 
not let history repeat itself for Sei, even if she had to bend a few 
rules to do it. 

Shimako was brought to the Yamayurikai, and in time, when it became 
apparent that despite all the work Youko put into making Shimako present 
and available, yes in fact Sei&#39;s petite soeur in all but name already, 
Sei would still not act, Youko&#39;s plotting took care even of that attempt 
at resistance. The slight but lingering rivalry between Sachiko and Sei 
served the purpose well, and Sei rose to the bait. There would be no 
repeat of the Shiori disaster on Youko&#39;s watch. 

Sei seemed to settle down once Shimako was her petite soeur, to Youko&#39;s 
relief. The free-spirited blonde was not as happy as Youko would have 
wished for, but she was at least healing &#150; Youko knew the healing 
properties having a petite soeur could have quite well &#150; and that was 
enough for now. The three Foetidas were happy and Sei was healing... 
that only left Youko&#39;s own precious little Sachiko to worry about. 

And worry Youko did. Sachiko was buckling under the increasing strain of 
her familial situation, without a petite soeur to ease her burden. Youko 
tried to help but could only do so much, and then things were brought to 
a head with the unfortunate joint school play. 

Youko tried, again, to convince Sachiko that she needed to take a petite 
soeur. Sei, with a bit of backing from Eriko, just did her worst to get 
on Sachiko&#39;s nerves that day, and things evolved into a shouting match 
before Sachiko stormed out of the room. 

Stormed right into the arms of Fukuzawa Yumi, and by rights there should 
have been some kind of cosmic sign, a clap of thunder or at the very 
least the ringing of the church bell, to signify the importance of that 
event. Despite the rocky start, Yumi entered their lives and their 
hearts, whether she meant to or not. 

Sei especially took a liking to the girl, so much so that Youko for a 
while worried that she had done Sei a disservice by pushing her towards 
Shimako. As she watched, astonished, as a deep and sincere &#150; and most of 
all, romantic &#150; love grew between her precious petite soeur and little 
Yumi, though, Youko could not help but feel that things were as they 
should be. Although it was clear that Sei and Yumi had bonded and cared 
greatly for one another, it was not a romantic thing, and no-one could 
possibly doubt how deeply Yumi was in love with Youko&#39;s petite soeur. 
Youko was happy knowing that even when she would leave the school there 
would be someone there for Sachiko, always and whatever happened. 

The only one that would never have any measure of real happiness of that 
kind to cling to was Youko herself. She knew this, and while it hurt to 
watch Sei, to remain by her side for all the tumultuous events of their 
last year at Lillian, yet never have Sei look her way even once, she had 
no objections. On Mizuno Youko&#39;s list of importance she herself had 
never held any prominent placing, ever. Life moved along regardless. 

So, suddenly, came graduation. It almost hit Youko from a blind corner, 
even though the Yamayurikai had prepared for it for so long. After 
graduating Youko would move on to another prestigious school to finish 
the kind of education her parents wanted for her, and the daily lives of 
the Yamayurikai members would be lost to her. Even though Youko would 
keep in touch with Eriko and Sei, and of course her precious Sachiko, 
the distance would become greater and greater... and Youko would no 
longer be able to be there to personally make sure each of the people 
she cared about were happy and safe.  

No longer would Youko look up from whatever she was doing to see Sei 
standing in the light by a familiar window, then turn towards Youko with 
that cheeky grin. 

She had not allowed herself to falter, walked out the school gates with 
her back straight and her head held high, not looking back. She 
considered it her final act as Rosa Chinensis. She, Sei and Eriko had 
said brief goodbyes, as if they were to meet again the next morning, 
then each had gone on in their own direction, Youko home to follow her 
already packaged and transported belongings to the town where she would 
go to school next. 

That night Youko had laid down on her bed and cried like a child, 
exhausted both physically and emotionally, feeling lonelier than ever. 
Her saving grace had been a phone call right before she was about to 
call it a night, from Sachiko whom worried and wanted to know if Youko 
had arrived alright. There had been tears in Sachiko&#39;s voice, but just 
hearing the girl she had feared would no longer be her petite soeur had 
soothed some of the pain in Youko. Although they never said it out loud 
then, Youko knew that she would always be Sachiko&#39;s respected older 
sister, even when the memories of Lillian itself had faded. 

It had made the loneliness a little easier to bear. 

Youko of course excelled at her new school, and she was quickly a name 
to respect and reckon with. It was not the same, however, meddling with 
the lives of strangers instead of meddling with the lives of those that 
been something between friends and family. Youko of course kept close 
contact with Sachiko and her family &#150; and also the rare, spaced-out, 
letter from Eriko - and that meant that when things went so bad, Youko 
packed her belongings and took time off from her school to come back 
home where she could better support Sachiko. 

At the time for Youko&#39;s return, things were not yet so dire and Sachiko 
and her mother still clung to some hope. They spent most of their time 
at the hospital where Youko only rarely joined them, so for the most 
part Youko spent her time at her own home or in town, just feeling 
better when she could be there on a moments notice if she was needed. 

She had hesitated at first to contact Sei, feeling uneasy with the sheer 
need she harboured to see the other woman again, but soon realised that 
she was being silly about it. The only thing that would seem strange to 
Sei was if Youko were in town and did not contact her old friend even 
briefly, so Youko did just that. Having failed to reach Sei on the 
phone, Youko merely appeared at the school gates at about the time when 
Sei would be making her way home for the day. 

The reunion would prove to be surprisingly fulfilling for Youko... and 
just plain surprising. 

Ignoring the many admiring looks sent her way Youko stood by the gate, 
somewhat anxiously scanning the crowds for a tall blonde form as 
familiar to her as anything. She was shocked to realise that her eyes 
swept past Sei&#39;s form twice before it registered somewhere within that 
the tall, short-haired blonde in a white shirt and dark pants that was 
walking along chatting animatedly with a brunette with glasses was not a 
boy but indeed the woman Youko was looking for. Something of her shock 
must have shown on her face for a moment, because as they got closer the 
brunette noticed Youko&#39;s stare and gave Sei a nudge in Youko&#39;s 
direction. 

As Sei&#39;s eyes turned to her Youko briefly amused herself with wondering 
if little Rei knew that Sei had stolen her haircut, then all thoughts 
promptly left her mind all at once as Sei&#39;s face broke out into a wide 
grin and the blonde called out her name. Sei immediately ran up to Youko 
and lifted her into her arms, spinning her around several times before 
engulfing the rather stunned Youko in a bear hug. 

Instinctively Youko had thrown her arms around Sei&#39;s neck when the other 
had started spinning her around, and as Sei did not release her tight 
grip around Youko&#39;s waist even after their hug, Youko decided to let her 
arms remain where they were for the time being. It was a treat she had 
never imagined she would receive, after all. 

The brunette came up to them and said a few greetings before walking off 
with an amused smile on her face, and then Sei and Youko began talking, 
staring at one another completely oblivious to the many stares and 
giggles sent their way by the other students as they walked slowly past 
them on their way to their respective homes. 

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you.&quot; The smile that never failed to leave Youko breathless 
made an appearance. &quot;Have you missed me?&quot; Though spoken in jest, the 
question had a touch of neediness that surprised them both.  

&quot;Yes, yes I have... yes I do.&quot; Youko answered honestly, charmed to see a 
pleased expression on those loved features. 

The hug this time was gentle, and sent a thrill down Youko&#39;s spine when 
she both felt and heard the taller woman briefly put her nose in Youko&#39;s 
black hair and take a deep breath. Youko&#39;s heart was pounding madly in 
her chest, this greeting was almost unreal... Sei holding her, breathing 
her, looking at her like a lover would... it was something Youko only 
occasionally dared to let herself imagine in the dark of night. It was 
not something that could actually happen. 

And yet it had. 

&quot;Youko?&quot; Sei drew back just enough so she could look into Youko&#39;s eyes 
again. &quot;What has happened? I doubt you&#39;re here just because I&#39;ve been 
missing you.&quot; 

So Youko told Sei all about Sachiko&#39;s family and her decision to return 
home for the time being so that she could offer whatever support Sachiko 
might need of her. In return Sei, concerned now that she found out that 
there had been more going on than she suspected, told Youko about the 
recent problems between Yumi and Sachiko. Youko&#39;s heart bled even more 
to hear it, and Sei tried to comfort Youko with the promise that if 
Sachiko and Yumi did not work things out on their own pretty soon, they 
would find a way to offer them a little help along the way. 

By the time the two former members of Lillian&#39;s famed Yamayurikai 
reluctantly disentangled, all other students had long since left the 
area. Somewhat abashed Youko tried to act casual about their long 
embrace as if it was a commonplace occurrence for them, when both women 
were well aware that it was anything but. Sei saved her from the 
embarrassment when she impulsively grabbed Youko&#39;s hand, fetched her 
abandoned things, and set of at a brisk pace towards her home, dragging 
the not unwilling Youko along with her. 

Youko was entranced by the sensation of the large, strong hand engulfing 
her own in its warmth... it felt right, her hand in Sei&#39;s, like it 
belonged there. 

Feeling a tiny bit daring for a moment Youko carefully twisted her hand 
in Sei&#39;s grip until she could entwine their fingers. Sei gave a small 
start and looked at their joined hands, but just as Youko was about to 
let go in fear that she had gone too far, Sei flashed her a huge, 
happily bright smile and firmed her grasp, pulling Youko a little closer 
as she resumed their speedy trek towards Sei&#39;s home. 

They would spend so much time talking that night snuck up on them, and 
Sei convinced Youko to spend the night. The following morning was 
hectic, but as they made their way outside they managed to make plans to 
meet later in the day for dinner, and then something happened as they 
were just about to part. 

In a move too quick for Youko to quite follow, Sei leaned in and pressed 
her lips in a brief but firm kiss to Youko&#39;s cheek. The taller woman 
spun around immediately after to make a mad dash in the direction of her 
school, not looking back, but Youko caught sight of the adorable blush 
on Sei&#39;s cheeks as she moved away.  

Youko was left standing there in a daze, hand to her tingling cheek, for 
a long, long time before she finally mustered up the will to move away 
from Sei&#39;s door. 

Amidst Youko&#39;s visits with Sachiko and the more and more grave situation 
for her precious petite soeur, Youko and Sei began dating. It was a 
subject discreetly approached between them, neither of them saying a 
word to suggest that was what they were doing, but the dinners, the 
movies, the picnics and long walks in the park... finally it seemed 
silly to pretend to be &#39;just friends&#39; when Sei showed up at Youko&#39;s 
doorstep dressed to kill, and took Youko out dancing. 

That night they shared their first real kiss, as Youko grasped her 
courage with both hands and pulled the woman who had just managed to 
steal her heart away all over again in for a sweet goodnight kiss. 

Or that was what it was supposed to be. But Sei and Youko were grown 
women whose emotions and desires had been steadily intensified during 
their period of undefined dating, and in Youko&#39;s case she had loved and 
longed for Sei for so very long. It was not as if they were strangers 
returning from their first date, or so Youko tried to justify events 
afterwards while Sei merely snickered and waggled her eyebrows. 

When Sei responded to Youko&#39;s kiss, all reason and propriety flew out 
the window. By the time they could somehow, with great effort, tear 
themselves away from the other woman&#39;s lips the night air around them 
had turned them both cold as ice and they just could not bear to part. 

It was a Friday night and nothing else mattered for the moment than the 
two of them. Youko invited Sei in, and Sei... stayed the weekend. 

In Sei&#39;s arms Youko discovered to her shock a wanton, passionate side of 
herself that the usually somewhat restrained woman had never imagined. 
In Youko&#39;s arms Sei found a safe place to rest her heart at long last, 
though it was not a process completed that quickly. In Youko Sei found a 
place she felt she belonged, finally, and in Sei Youko found someone 
that did not require Youko to be the strong caretaker all the time, 
someone that would hold her as she wept and take care of her for a 
change. 

Then matters with Sachiko got worse, and Youko was finally forced to act 
on her petite soeur&#39;s behalf, bringing Yumi to Sachiko&#39;s side in her 
hour of need. 

Roughly a week later Youko had to return to her school. 

Parting with Sei now, after waiting for all those years to finally have 
her love, was hard on Youko, as watching the only other woman she had 
dared to love in her young life leave her behind was for Sei, but they 
were old enough and intelligent enough to know that it was inevitable. 
They were also quite determined to make things work despite the 
distance. 

When they had sat down to have the conversation, the first real one 
they&#39;d had regarding their relationship, Youko had come right out and 
told Sei that if she wanted Youko to remain close by she would drop out 
of school and return for good. Sei, humbled and happy about the offer 
but well aware of how important the degree Youko was striving for might 
prove to be, kissed and hugged her lover and suggested instead that they 
try to put up with it, to go visit one another at any and all 
opportunities they would get and call as often as possible. Unbeknownst 
to each other both women began planning how to change their academic 
load in ways that would grant them an extra day off every other weekend, 
allowing for a weekend visit with each other. 

The day Youko were to go, Sei did not follow her to the train station. 
Instead they said their goodbyes at Sei&#39;s home, and Sachiko came by to 
follow Youko to the station. It was something Youko understood well, and 
she had not expected Sei to be able to see her off at that place, in 
fact she would not have wanted Sei to have to see Youko leave her behind 
at that particular spot, even if they both knew they would not be apart 
for all that long. 

Just as Youko was about to board the train a young man in an outfit that 
boasted a floral delivery company came running shouting her name. 
Sachiko, lingering on the platform until the train left the station, 
intercepted him and managed to help him hand over some wrapped flowers 
to Youko before the doors were closing. 

Alone in her seat after waving to her little sister one more time Youko 
carefully opened the slender package with some anxiety. The plain white 
paper came off revealing two long-stemmed roses in a small but 
thankfully sturdy flute, one deep red and one pure white, and a small 
card attached to them with a tiny red ribbon. 

Blinking against the tears that had sprung to her eyes, Youko reached 
for the card... only to have something fall out into her hand with a 
tiny jingling sound. Surprised she focused on the cold and unexpected 
object first... and gasped. 

It was a small silver necklace, the chain tiny and the locket a small, 
stylized heart with a single sparkling little stone set into it. It was 
not an expensive piece of jewellery, but it was tasteful and in a style 
Youko liked, although right then Youko would have loved anything no 
matter how gaudy a bauble had been given her. 

Youko&#39;s hands shook as she opened the card at last, holding the necklace 
reverently in one hand. 

&quot;Be mine&quot; 

It was all the card said and it was unsigned, but Youko would know Sei&#39;s 
sloppy and slightly lopsided handwriting anywhere. Choking down a sob 
Youko lifted first the card and then the necklace gently to her lips, 
then she put the card and the flowers carefully aside, rewrapping them 
in their protective paper, before finally putting the necklace around 
her neck. 

It was a perfect fit. 

Youko smiled, blinking away a few tears that escaped. It was fortunate 
that she never went anywhere without her cell phone, she thought, and 
that she always made sure her phone was state of the art. The sleek 
black shell Youko pushed open with a tiny snap was more like a 
miniaturised computer than anything else... it would make finding a 
local flower shop and a jewellery store so much easier, not to mention 
finding a fitting gift. 

Youko already knew what the card would say. 

Forever yours.</pre>
