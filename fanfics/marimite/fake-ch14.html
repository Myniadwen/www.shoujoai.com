<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My knowledge of pro  soccer is limited, so I apologize if I make a fool of myself when I  talk about it. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you spot something  blatantly ridiculous.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At the  time of this writing, I have just finished watching Marimite OVA 5.  God help me, I giggled like a little girl. I wish I was lying, honest  I do.  Go get it.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In Japan,  there are many hotels whose toilets are western-style. The girls are  staying at one of them.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  you’re ever lost, there’s work to do.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">  Brainstorm<br />
(With the lights out, it’s less dangerous.)</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All of  these years I’ve been wondering around; wondering how come nobody  told me…</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  second, Sachiko wasn’t sure where she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Scratch  that. Sachiko wasn’t quite sure of anything for a second. She felt  as though she might be floating, but rationalized that that ought to  be impossible. She felt as though something was hitting her head, but  heard no impact.  It was entirely possible that she didn’t even  have ears. Her eyes weren’t working, either. She opened them and  saw a thin blackness which seemed to promise light if one could only  move past it, through it; if one could only do the impossible.  Was  that really impossible? Nothing was certain. It made Sachiko feel  considerably less insecure than it ought to have.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The only  thing that was entirely certain was the pain. She had felt as though  somebody was hitting her head because of the thumping, constant pain  underneath her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>The  only certain thing is the pain.” Isn’t that a little  melodramatic? </em>Sachiko thought, sleepily bemused. <em>After all,  I’m quite certain that I’m warm. I’m quite certain that I’m  laying next to a heater, in fact. It’s a hot summer, but it’s  really quite pleasant on top of the air conditioning. It doesn’t  balance out the pain in my head, but it certainly helps.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>See?  Right there, I’ve become certain of two other things. I’m in a  room, because I can feel the air conditioning circulating through the  room, and I’m laying next to a heater. I bet I could even feel it  if I tried. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  was suddenly struck with the strange idea that if she could, in fact,  touch the heater, she might be able to move past the thin blackness  above her.  Presuming anything <em>was</em> above it in whatever room  she was in. Beyond the first, thin blackness could just be another  blackness, thicker this time, more impenetrable.  Maybe beyond this  blackness, her head didn’t even hurt. That would be nice. Unlikely,  but nice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  first thing was to locate her hand. Easy; it was still attached to  her body. That was good. Another thing certain; she was not floating,  ephemerally, above herself. <em>This whole thing, in fact, seems quite  ridiculous. Why don’t I just reach out and touch—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then she stopped thinking and froze, because as she considered this,  she <em>did </em>reach out and touch the heater, which was, in fact,  nothing of the sort, unless the new trend in heaters was to build  them fleshy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  night before came rushing back to her in a broken torrent of  half-convoluted images, like watching an unfocused, muted film that  one kept nodding off in the middle of.  It was hard to track,  especially so since somebody kept knocking what was behind her  forehead around like a soccer ball.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A pass  to midfield.<br />
      <em>Sachiko  begins to drink, and then</em><br />
  a  feint left, dribble forward<br />
  <em>Yumi  points at her nose as though she has something on it, and when she  tries to brush it off her nose goes all crooked and Yumi snorts a  laugh and then</em><br />
  a  steal, suddenly driving the way it came<br />
  <em>Rei  and Sei are ushering them out of the room, telling them something  about partners and problems—boy, if I had a nickel for every one of  those—partners, not problems—somebody says, and it might be  Sachiko but it might not, but Sachiko laughs anyway, it feels so damn  good to just laugh and</em><br />
  a  slide which is very nearly suicidal and very nearly red-carded but in  the end neither, and then it’s going the other way again<br />
  <em>then  Yumi is sliding out of her bra in the moonlight</em><br />
  the  way the ball is dribbled past the defense is nothing short of genius  and<br />
  <em>then  Sachiko is slipping out of her shirt  in the moonlight</em><br />
  suddenly  there’s nobody left between the ball and the goalie who possibly  for the first time in his life feels a trickle of fear in his gut,  wondering if maybe missing this isn’t the worst thing that could  happen to him, but rather catching it is because it may just kill him<br />
  <em>and  Yumi’s lips. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Goal.  And by golly if the goalie’s shorts ain’t wet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had thought she had kissed people before. She had certainly given her  share of theatrical kisses to Suguru when everybody was looking, and  once when<br />
      <em>not  thinking about that</em><br />
  they  weren’t. She thought she had kissed before, <em>really </em>kissed,  but she was wrong, and her throbbing, muddled head still could not  comprehend the scale on which she was wrong. She wasn’t really,  wholly sure how to react to it, therefore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Embarrassment?  If there was one thing a Lady should never show, it was  embarrassment. Embarrassment was an admission of guilt, and while  nobody ought to be accusing a Lady in the first place, if they did,  the last thing that Lady did was admit to it by blushing. Such things  were best saved for private encounters with men who liked their girls  innocent and stupid—and one should only be having such encounters  with one man: The husband.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Happiness?<em>About kissing your petite soeur? Are you out of your mind?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  not?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You</em>are <em>out of your mind.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fear?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That one  seemed appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, that  one seemed likely.  What the hell had she gotten herself into?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  stirred next to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes,  fear seemed entirely likely. The next thing to squirm through her  slushy brain was simple enough to be repeated over and over again  without much pain: <em>Does she remember?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  voice. “<em>Onee-sam—</em>owowowow…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  moment, Sachiko could not speak. And then, much more groggily than  she had intended: “Are you awake then, Yumi?” More groggily, and  sharper. Harsher.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,<em>Onee-sama</em>.”  If Yumi noticed, she didn’t show it.  If Yumi  felt anywhere near like Sachiko did, she was probably too busy  watching a play-by-play of a basketball game in her head to notice.  “My head…hurts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  afraid mine does too. I suppose we must have had too much to drink  last night, and now we’re paying our rightful due.” <em>Amazing.  Even with a hangover the size of Honshu, you can still wax irritable.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should we get out of bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, something strange happened: Sachiko tried to get out of the  bed, which was comfortable and warm; she tried to greet the day the  same way she always did, with a sense of grim determination that she  showed to nobody.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  unlike most days, she failed. That small thing inside of her that  always pushed her, refused to let her flag or rest, even for a  moment; that thing that had failed only once or twice before today,  failed.  She tried to push herself out of bed, moved a couple of  inches, gave up. She tried to roll, made it halfway, found herself on  her face. Gave up. She tried simply willing the bed to roll out from  under her. It mocked her, unmoving. Gave up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi,  are you having trouble getting out of bed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm,”  Yumi replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think we’re stuck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do,  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For some  reason, this was unbearably funny, and they laughed a few moments  before the pain in their heads forced them to squeeze their eyes shut  and hide under the covers. There, they found each other again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though  Sachiko was only able to open her eyes about halfway without  splitting her temples open, she looked at Yumi hard, trying to gauge  whether or not the other girl remembered anything about the night  before. If she did, she was hiding it well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  morning, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” Yumi said half-brightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The most  Sachiko could manage was a half-smile. Perhaps it could be just a  half-day, and the two of them could go back to bed after six hours or  so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then the  door began to thump, and Sachiko had a strange, off-kilter thought: <em>I  wonder if the door is soundproof? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later, the painfully cheerful voice of Satou Sei came through the  door, as unfettered as if she had been standing right next to them.  “Wake up, kids. Can’t sleep all day, can you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I</em> could, if you left us alone,” Yumi called back, and Sei laughed.  The noise hurt Sachiko’s head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’ll  never happen and you know it. You’ve got about ten seconds to get  out of bed or else I’m coming in there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  door’s locked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  pilfered one of your keys last night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  eyes went briefly wide, and Sachiko was sure the shock showed on her  face as well; she wasn’t quite ready to put on her face that day.  Not quite yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  lying,” Yumi called back. “Aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am  I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  looked at Sachiko, asking silently, <em>do you have your key? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had no idea. After a moment, Yumi caught onto this, and whispered,  “The only way to know is if we get out and check.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  would give Sei an unbearable victory,” Sachiko whispered back, and  Yumi nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  be very quiet. She won’t hear,” Yumi assured her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  about this seemed not-quite-right to Sachiko, who acquiesced,  regardless, with a nod. A moment later, Yumi was very clumsily making  for the edge of the sheets. Sachiko closed her eyes again and, for  good measure, covered them with her hand, a move brought on not so  much by fear as by the light let into her sanctuary by Yumi as she  adjusted the covers, trying to escape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later she heard the distinct sound of something sliding, a brief  squeal of surprise, and a thump. Yumi groaned pathetically, and  Sachiko sighed in defeat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later, Sei laughed again. “Got you,” she said. “May as well get  up now, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  voice from outside, very distinctly Rei’s: “Sei, let them be.  Yoshino wanted to lie down, so they can sleep for another hour or  so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  ruining my fun so early, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  nearly ten.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  early enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let  them be, Sei. Remember the first time you got drunk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  and I think that’s the point.” A moment of silence, and then,  “Fine, fine. I’ll be back, you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  sound of retreating footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence.  Blessed silence. A wave of peace washed over Sachiko, relative though  it was. (The soccer match in her head was, after all, far from over;  it seemed the goalie had changed his shorts and was ready for another  round.)  She laid like that, her hands over her eyes, buried in the  covers, for a period of time she was never quite able to track—it  felt like a long time, but the sun, so far as she could tell, had not  changed positions when she finally did get up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  bit of this strange, flexible time had passed, she heard movement in  the room, and a moment later, a gentle hand touched her side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>,”  Yumi’s voice murmured, “we should get up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do…”<em>do we have to? Pretend for a moment that you’re older than  seven, Sachiko. </em>“Yes.  You’re right. Of course.” Sachiko  rolled over, an act which churned her stomach just a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  said, “Don’t be alarmed, <em>Onee-sama</em>. I’m going to pull  the sheet back slowly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Must  you?” Sachiko’s tone sounded more like a whine than she would  have wanted, but she supposed that was the thing about whining; one  could rarely help it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t very well let you take it to the restroom while you brush  your teeth,” Yumi said patiently.  “I imagine it would be rather  difficult to get at your mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  giggled in spite of herself, but a moment later, had a thought which  squashed any urge to smile: <em>Yumi is </em>handling <em>me, isn’t  she? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sometimes,  people must be handled. Didn’t they teach you that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Difficult  people.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  train of thought was interrupted as a small sun rose in her field of  view, going from dark to blindingly white in the span of a second.  Done slowly or not, crossing the threshold of light to dark was  almost unbearable to Sachiko as her head seemed to try to burst from  the inside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  her stomach churned, and then it kicked. Familiar.  Too familiar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko’s  eyes widened and her hand went to cover her mouth, and her mind  blanked except for a single, pervasive command,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>GET OFF OF THE BED YOU’LL RUIN IT</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">which  she was powerless to resist as she scrambled blindly, fumbling over  herself trying to get off of the faux-silk sheets with only one hand  and the kind of white panic that accompanies the sick churn of a  violent stomach.   Somewhere deep in the back of her mind, she was  certain she must look wholly foolish, but that single, undeniable  command</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>GET  OFF THE BED YOU’LL RUIN IT</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">said  nothing about grace.  Only</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>GET  OFF THE BED YOU’LL RUIN IT.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  made it to toilet and threw the seat up, her hair in her face,  smelling of sweat and beer, her eyes stinging, her gullet working  violently, and heaved, dry, once; twice; and then she heaved whatever  was in her stomach—very little, it seemed—into the toilet.  Her stomach settled only just, and then a hand was there, pulling her  hair out of her face, gently as it could, perhaps, but still roughly,  focused on getting all of it.  A moment later, her stomach lurched,  and she vomited stomach acid, and then her stomach was calm.  Her  throat burned, the stench from the toilet was positively vile, and  her head swam, but her stomach settled, and her headache began to  retreat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A small,  pale hand reached from behind her and flushed the toilet.  It left a  residue on the handle that Sachiko had to turn away from, but the  sudden rush of cool water beneath her was relieving all the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  rustle, and then a handkerchief in her peripheral vision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  use this, <em>onee-sama</em>,” Yumi said, and the sound of her voice  brought the world back into focus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  turned to look at the handkerchief for a moment, tentatively. It was  white, with a heart in the corner; nothing overly complicated, but  not bare, either.  It was Yumi’s, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  couldn’t ruin your handkerchief.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  won’t. Promise.”  Sachiko could hear the smile in Yumi’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  took the handkerchief and used it to dab at her mouth.  It came away  a shade of yellow that made Sachiko want to look away. She folded it  neatly and set it on top of the toilet.  “You can let go of my hair  now, Yumi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll  ruin your nightgown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won’t. Promise.”  Sachiko thought that echoing Yumi’s obviously  flawless argument might be enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  will,” Yumi said.  “If I can use a towel, I can cover your hair  long enough to get you out of it and into the shower without ruining  anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A dozen  counter-arguments popped into Sachiko’s head, which was working  just well enough to recognize that none of them made a lick of sense.  She blinked, and the world seemed to flash white as her eyes closed.  She blinked again and the world behaved itself.  A good start.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>…”  Yumi sounded tentative, a little unsure for the first time all  morning. It was almost strange, though it was more her norm. “Do  you think you could…grab the towel? My hands are—er—stuck  here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stuck?”  This made no sense. Did her vomit have some sort of strange adhesive  property? Had she eaten glue?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I  let go, that ruins the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  clever argument. “I’ll stand up slowly.” <em>We’ve seen where</em>slowly <em>gets us already. Just do it, like a band-aid.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  think I might fall if I did that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stood, and walked slowly to the towel rack.  Yumi followed in easy  step with her.  Yumi seemed to be taking to the morning much more  quickly than she was—wasn’t this her first time drinking? It  couldn’t be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  not?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  it was Sachiko’s first time drinking so heavily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  so?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  so…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  would make you a step behind, is that it? </em>The sharp voice of her  manners coach: <em>My dear, that is where you have been your whole  life. That’s where </em>all <em>Ladies walk. It’s nothing to be  ashamed of.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…</em>Was  it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko grabbed the towel, now in reach, and passed it to Yumi,  who used it to wrap Sachiko’s hair. After she had done this,  without warning, she began tugging at Sachiko’s nightgown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko’s  reaction was less startled than it ought to have been.  In fact, the  first thing that came to her mind seemed to make absolutely no sense:<em>If you want to do it here, may I at least clean my hair first?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  Sachiko clumsily moved her arms up, with this one thought in mind  (possibly all her mind could handle at this point) she began to  laugh. Politely, at first—truly a reflex for her at all times but  her most inebriated— quiet and virtually motionless, only a small  smile on her face to show that she was, in fact, amused.  But as she  struggled to keep her hair in the towel as Yumi struggled to move the  nightgown over her head—<em>If you want to do it here, may I at  least clean my hair first?—</em>and past Sachiko’s extended arm,  far too long to make such an operation graceful at a hungover ten  o’clock, she began to laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, <em>onee-sama</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  first, Sachiko wasn’t even sure if she could say it aloud.  When  she opened her mouth to try, though, it was easier than she’d  expected. “If you want to do it here, may I at least clean my hair  first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she  said this, the nightgown dropped.  She began sliding it off her other  arm, letting her hair drop again—certainly disgusting, but she  thought she might be able to handle it for the half-minute before she  got into the shower if it meant letting that arm rest. Yumi was  silent throughout, and as the nightgown finally fell to the floor in  a heap, Sachiko’s smile faded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  turned around to face Yumi, entirely naked in front of the girl for  the second time in less than twelve hours.  Yumi’s face was wholly  serious, a combination of fear and…<em>and what?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose,” Sachiko murmured, “That it was more amusing in my  head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  much of last night does she remember?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, almost thirty seconds late but acting as though the time gap  didn’t exist, Yumi smiled, big and confined to the lower half of  her face, and said, “That’s funny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  looked at Yumi for a moment, and then something basic and  uncontrollable inside of her rebelled and she said, “If you don’t  mind, I think I’ll shower first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  do,” Yumi said, and then, with a look at Sachiko which lasted a  good ten seconds, and went to the sink, washed her hands, and left  the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  think, maybe, quite a bit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Doing  her best to put it out of her mind, Sachiko stepped into the shower  and turned the water on. The water was soothing, but the thought  never left.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Though  it was hard to tell by looking at her, speaking to her, or, perhaps,  doing things with her that might make a nun blush, Sei Satou was  somebody for whom an ideal relationship was both loving and  committed. Her roommate at Lillian University had once asked her why  this was, when it was so much more convenient, and frankly, fun to  steer clear of staunch commitment in favor of casual dating, and  indeed, casual sex, and this is how she responded:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Your  lover walks through the door of the home which one, or perhaps both,  of you have paid for and maintained with your sweat, blood, and  ass-kissing. There is something off in the person’s step, in the  way they open the door and let it close behind them rather than  shutting it quietly like a Lady ought, but you’re not somebody who  likes long-term relationships, so the two of you have only been  dating for about two weeks. Why she’s coming to your house after a  long, hard day at work is maybe beyond you, or maybe it’s not,  because you called her over.  But whatever the case, you don’t  notice that extra </em>thump <em>when she slides off her shoes,  forgetting to tap them clean.  You only notice the way her hips sway  as she walks in, how nice her thighs look in her high-cut skirt. Your  mind follows the sway of her hips and the line of her thighs and  before long, it’s in the gutter, where you’re hoping to be in  about half an hour, and so you rise to greet her, move to give her a  kiss that would make God take a second look, and she pecks you on the  lips and goes to sit down on the couch.  Her face looks normal, maybe  a little more drawn than usual, but you don’t see anything wrong. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>No  sex for you that day, then, is there? In life, we find ourselves  coming home in just that state more often than not, I think, and I  don’t think many girls would want to have sex with somebody who  doesn’t catch the little look that says, </em>my day sucked dirt,  and yours?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As the door to Yumi’s room closed behind her, Sei heard the  distinct sound of the shower running and frowned. She watched Yumi as  the girl let the door shut behind her, rather than shutting it  herself. She noticed that Yumi wasn’t wearing shoes, or even socks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And she  saw the look on Yumi’s face.  Not<em> sad</em>, not quite.  Just…wrong.  Neutral, overly so for somebody whose feelings were  usually on her face, clearer than day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Pensive.  That’s it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  saw this, and knew it was <em>wrong</em>. And that, somehow, seemed to  justify her entire viewpoint on love and relationships in a single  instant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She had  been standing in the hall when Yumi exited her room—waiting outside  her own for Shimako, who had kicked her out while she changed,  something which baffled and bothered Sei at once, but which she  accepted with a sigh and a shrug nonetheless (though she had since  been idly pondering sneaking a glimpse under an inevitably shaky  pretense)—and decided in an instant that she could wait to see just  what her <em>petite soeur </em>had to be shy about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  Yumi,” she said, starting to walk towards the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh.”   Yumi said, and then blinked, and shook her head, as though in a  double-take (though Sei could see that it was most plainly not).  “Oh!” With more feeling this time. “Hi, Sei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I got  you out of bed, did I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  guess you did.” Yumi wrinkled her nose, and Sei grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hangover?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  paused for a minute, and then let her voice slump like her shoulders  undoubtedly wanted to.  “You can tell?” She sounded relieved to  be able to relax.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sort  of. You had a lot to drink—I’d have been surprised if you hadn’t  had one.  You seem remarkably well, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  attempted a smile.  “Well, I’m doing my best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  your head feels like a packed soccer stadium.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She let  her attempt drop.  Again, relief. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  spotted it. <em>That’s what’s wrong. She’s trying to fake a  perky attitude, which she’s not suited for, and usually doesn’t  bother to attempt; that sounds more like Sachiko’s field.  Why is  she doing that? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  all right to let yourself look like you feel,” Sei said with a  grin, and Yumi laughed openly, which made Sei grin wider.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  can’t quite go <em>that </em>far. I think that might make <em>onee-sama</em>scream in terror.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  couldn’t think of what to say to that, so she laughed with Yumi.  When they stopped, they shared a brief silence which Yumi seemed to  savor—probably the noise still hurt her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Why  is she doing that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Why  don’t you ask her? </em>The prospect was, in a way that Sei could  not quite comprehend, frightening. Even thinking about how she might  phrase such a question made her stomach twist just slightly.  Not  enough to really make her feel ill, nor enough to stop her were she  honestly determined, but she wasn’t, and that was the problem: Part  of her honestly didn’t want to ask.  She felt as though the answer  might be something so final that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That  what?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Just…  final.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Coward.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>We  all are. In our own ways, we all are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  hesitated. “I…if I tell you something, can you not tell anybody?  Especially Rei or Yoshino?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why  not them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just…don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  frowned. “Sure.” Her stomach twisted again. That little, tingling  fear. Fear of the final. <em>Maybe that’s one of the ways I’m a  hypocrite. I don’t profess to be afraid of the </em>final, <em>of the  committed, of the permanent, but that’s only when it goes </em>my<em>way. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  didn’t even notice that she was holding her breath, just a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Onee-sama</em>threw up again this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  exhaled and the knot in her stomach untwisted instantly. She wanted  to laugh and say, <em>that’s it? </em>but knew that Yumi might never  speak to her again if she did. The worry was plain on the girl’s  face, in such a real and fundamental way that Sei couldn’t help but  empathize.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  understand why that worries you, but it’s okay. Sometimes hangovers  cause nausea, and for a person with as weak a stomach as Sachiko,  nausea can lead to vomiting. I’ll bet you she felt a whole hell of  a lot better after she did it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  rubbed her hand as though washing it, her face a little unsettled. “I  hope so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  get some on your hand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  jumped slightly and her eyes widened in surprise. It made her look a  little less like a zombie and a little more like Yumi. Sei approved  of the effect. “How could you tell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your  face, same way I know everything else you’re thinking. Also, I’d  have to be an idiot not to think that if Sachiko was throwing up,  you’d be yanking her hair back so fast you probably took a few  hairs with you as souvenirs.”  As she said this, Yumi’s face  brightened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As it  fell to silence again, Sei knew there was precisely one more topic  for them to discuss before they fell into idle banter—which, in  Yumi’s condition, would not last long at all.  A topic she had to  broach, because it, too, was on Yumi’s face, which meant it was on  Yumi’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And even  so, Sei rebelled against it.  Fought it internally, considered  whether or not choking herself to stave off the inevitable for a few  more minutes, or even seconds, would be considered brave or stupid,  wondered, briefly, what Shimako was doing in their room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  finally, gave in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  what else is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  looked away. “I always tell myself that you can’t read my  expressions like you say you can, but I guess I’m just kidding  myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  the burden of being honest. I kind of envy you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi’s  face looked pained, and she looked up at Sei, who bent down slightly  so that she didn’t need to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Silence.   After a minute, Sei said, “You might want to speak up soon.  Another five minutes like this and I’ll probably never stand up  straight again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  looks kind of creepy,” Yumi said sheepishly.  Sei grinned, but did  not move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Another  few seconds passed.  Sei’s back was beginning to ache, but her  stubbornness did not budge an inch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I…”  Yumi said at last. “What do you do with a feeling that you’ve  held onto for so long, long enough that it feels almost the same as a  teddy bear—something like a wish, only so high up in the sky that  even when you’re holding it you get this little feeling, like  you’re fooling yourself, because nobody can hold onto something as  high as the moon, even if it looks like you can squeeze it between  your fingers…what do you do when that just falls into your lap all  of a sudden, without any warning at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  there it was. Finality, so quick and sudden that it was like ripping  a off band-aid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And like  ripping off a band-aid, it stung at first, but afterwards, it wasn’t  too bad.  It left a dull ache where it tore some hairs, a little  sting to her pride, but it was nowhere near as agonizing as she had  been, at some level, hoping for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  stood up straight. Her back gave a little crack as she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She took  a deep breath.  What <em>did </em>somebody do when something like that  just fell into their lap, instead of...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Instead  of what? Working hard for it?  Ambiguity aside, Sei thought that  perhaps nobody had worked harder for that sort of feeling in all  their lives. And really, people might <em>grow </em>to love one  another, but there was still one specific moment when it just <em>fell</em>on the other person: A moment of revelation, perhaps; or perhaps  just a drunken <em>something </em>(for what, precisely, Sei did not  know, and might never know) after a night of fun and beer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  thought that maybe that feeling <em>falling into Yumi’s lap </em>was  the last thing that had happened last night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  think that you should thank God for finally rewarding your hard  work,” Sei said. “Or maybe thank yourself for working so damn  hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  what do I <em>do </em>with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  shrugged. “I think people spend most of their lives trying to  figure that out. Take it slow is all I can say. Or if that’s too  frustrating, take it fast. But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  accept it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“With  open arms and a word of gratitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  looked at Sei for a moment longer than was polite at a social  function, but a minute or two less than was rude the day after  getting drunk in a hotel room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  very scary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tell  me about it, sister,” Sei said.  “My <em>petite soeur </em>actually  kicked me out of the room to change this morning, which is why I was  out here in the first place. She’s been in there so long, though,  that I think she might be dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Does  that scare you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  scared me that she felt the need to kick me out to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Because  I feel like Shimako wouldn’t be shy around me without a reason, and  that reason is just as scary as your feeling. All of our abstract  concepts are biting us in the ass today, I guess. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  thought this, but instead of saying it, she said, “A feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Whether  or not this made sense to Yumi, she did not question Sei further.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">A few  seconds later, Sei’s door opened. A voice drifted out like a light  breeze: <em>Onee-sama?</em> Sei reacted to it like a dog picking up a  new scent: Her head jerked towards her door, and her face screwed up  with concentration.  A second later, she said, “I think I should  go.”  Yumi nodded, projecting <em>sage </em>as best she could, and  Sei turned and walked quickly into her room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  then, the hall was empty, and for a while, Yumi felt that the only  things she had were the vague scent of carpet freshener and the dim  sound of a vacuum somewhere on the floor below them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  maybe, for a while, that was true.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">After  all, what did one do when something that they had held onto like a  teddy bear for so long, holding it tight for solace and for fantasy  alike, suddenly fell from the sky, and all it was was a drunken kiss  and an erotic scene in the dark?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It  was nice, and it was sexy in a way that I never thought it would  be—how could I have imagined the way the moonlight would hit her  skin, or just how closely I felt my clothes drop off— but it didn’t  feel…special at all. It might have meant something, but it seems  just as likely that it meant nothing at all to her. I can barely pick  out two minutes of solid memories from last night. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Is  this…disappointment? Was I expecting something more out of kissing  her; out of </em>realizing <em>that maybe there was something more to  the two of us? A heart-shaped firework, or a bolt of lightning,  maybe? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Maybe  I was.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">If  she had asked this of Sei, Sei might have told her, <em>at the end of  every fantasy is disappointment, because compared to the rich,  dreamlike fantasies that a single mind can create, real life is bland  and colorless. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As  it was, there was one other person in their group who knew that, as  little as Yumi wanted to worry them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Two, if  one were to count that ragged teddy bear that Yumi now knew the true  shape of for the first time in her life.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Three</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Everybody  had a good year.</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Yoshino Shimazu was doing surprisingly well, considering that her  body was still not quite as strong as it should be, and also  considering that she was fairly certain that the previous night, she  had had enough beer to kill a horse. A small horse, perhaps, but  still a horse.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei  still didn’t want her out of bed, but she was about ninety percent  certain that this was more because of the fact that Yoshino didn’t  particularly want herself out of bed, either. She had woken up about  an hour and a half earlier, and about halfway through groggily,  irritably brushing her teeth, had said something to the effect of <em>I  need to lie down before I fall down, </em>and then proceeded to flop  onto the bed and drop off into sleep within seconds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The fact  was, though, that Yoshino would need to get out of bed soon. They had  to check out in another hour or so, and frankly, Rei had a nagging  feeling that if they didn’t make it to Kyoto soon, they might never  make it at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And so,  after making all of her own preparations—which basically consisted  of combing her hair, brushing her teeth, and applying a light base of  makeup, and took a grand sum total of twenty minutes, including time  spent rummaging around the room aimlessly—Rei set to the Herculean  task of rousing Yoshino.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  began cautiously, knowing that Yoshino, when angered by being roused  too quickly or roughly, was a formidable opponent. She touched the  girl’s shoulder lightly, murmuring, “Okay, Yoshino. It’s time  to wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  received a grunt in response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Trouble,  it sounded like.  Rei backed off and tried a different ploy, more  passive-aggressive: She opened the curtains, and for good measure,  the window.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Rei,”  Yoshino mumbled from underneath the covers, “bright.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It <em>is</em>almost half past ten, Yoshino,” Rei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Feels  like five jackhammers past six in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  believe that’s your own fault.  Do you have any idea how much you  had to drink last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yoshino  turned over, and Rei grinned when she was sure she wouldn’t be  seen. The grin was less mischievous than she felt, really, and was  largely due to the fascinating way that Yoshino’s already-wavy hair  seemed to have developed a certain curl to it overnight. It was  probably a kink, and she would probably hear grief over it later, but  for now, it was really very cute.  She sat down on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yoshino,  you need to get up now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  sounds less like something I need to do than something you need to  do,” Yoshino grumbled, and Rei laughed, unable to help herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  very frightening,” Rei said gently. “But if you don’t get up,  you’re going to get left behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  wouldn’t.” It wasn’t even an accusation. It was simple fact,  and they both knew it. “You’re not old enough to be my mother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d  rather not be by the time we get out of here, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was  time to bring in the big guns.  “Yoshino, it’s time. You can  sleep in the car, but if you don’t get up soon, we’ll have to pay  extra for the rooms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Still  have a half hour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  going to take you that long to get your hair straight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  believe you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  would if you looked in the mirror.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was  strange. What they were doing was certainly bickering—there was no  more friendly way to describe it, really—but it didn’t leave any  sort of emotional mark on Rei, and probably didn’t leave any on  Yoshino, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  then, at last, Yoshino sat up and shook her head gently. Rei put a  palm on Yoshino’s forehead, which was warmer than it ought to have  been but not hot enough to be dangerous to her—she would make sure  her <em>petite soeur </em>got some aspirin in her before they went too  far—and Yoshino put her hand over Rei’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your  hand is very cool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei  simply sat there for a minute, savoring the feeling of Yoshino’s  skin but not showing it as Yoshino did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Rei,”  Yoshino said finally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did  we do the right thing last night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  mean, did <em>you </em>do the right thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yoshino  didn’t seem happy with this, but she nodded her acquiesce anyway.  “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t know. I think so, but I don’t think so, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei gave  her a half-grin and sat down next to her.  “I mean, I think you  helped somebody last night, and whether you ask Jesus or your  neighbor, that’s always the right thing to do. If anybody needed a  chance to stop thinking so hard all the time, it was Sachiko. At the  same time….” Rei sighed, and shook her head in the way she often  did when she wanted to say, <em>you’ll learn someday, Yoshino, </em>but  didn’t want to be shouted at. “At the same time, you drank enough  to kill yourself, I think, and if you had had anything more than a  light fever this morning I would probably have strangled you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Out  of worry.” In spite of herself and in spite of being told off—in  a way—by Rei, Yoshino could not help but smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Out  of worry,” Rei agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yoshino  leaned her head against Rei’s shoulder. It was one of the places  she liked best in the world.  “I’m sorry for worrying you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  fine. I brought along plenty of aspirin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wasn’t  this supposed to be a spontaneous trip?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was. I always have plenty of aspirin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yoshino  gave an obligatory sigh and then flopped back onto the bed. To Rei,  the sigh may have sounded <em>don’t-mother-me </em>frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In  truth, Yoshino just didn’t want Rei to see her grin about an  aspirin collection.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Those  were the sorts of things that she held onto by herself. Maybe because  she didn’t want anybody else to see the shape of them.  Maybe  because she thought they would not understand—after all, with a  shape so ragged, how could they understand what it meant?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">That was  okay. She understood.</span></p>

Half an  hour later, all but one of them had gathered in the hallway—Shimako  candidly reported to Yumi, upon questioning, that after Sei had come  back in, they had “spoken” for about ten minutes, and then Sei  had left to go to the front desk. She had not come back yet. Her tone  of voice revealed nothing, as was normal for Shimako, but even so,  something made Yumi worry. She shelved it in the back of her  mind—something she hated doing—promising to return to it when she  had the emotional energy to.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Since speaking with Sei, she certainly felt <em>better</em>, but, for  the first time in a long time, she felt simply…drained. For  somebody whose production of energy was typically in the range of<em>prodigious, </em>this was a mildly unsettling feeling.  She liked  to think that by taking a small break from seeing anybody—as she  had done after Sei left and she opted to hide out in the hall rather  than return to her room and talk to Sachiko as she, presumably, made  herself up for the day—she had done a lot of work towards  recharging herself, but in truth, it had just made her lonely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  first two to filter out into the hall were Rei and Yoshino.  Yoshino  was holding a small, moist handkerchief to her forehead, which didn’t  surprise Yumi in the least—not after she had been to Italy with  Yoshino. If a flight had tired her out enough to make her a bit ill,  Yumi didn’t want to think about the effect a hangover would have on  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako  had come next, and a minute or two later, Sachiko.  She and Yumi had  conversed politely, but it had felt a bit…dead.  Maybe that was the  hangover, but maybe it wasn’t, too. Yumi had allowed herself a  brief moment to become convinced that it was, indeed, the hangover,  before she shoved that, too to the back of her mind.  Trains of  thought which were distinctly and uniquely negative belonged there. <em>Bad roads, </em>her mother had always told her, <em>are marked  clearly enough that anybody who pays attention can see them coming  and avoid walking them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>I  just need time, that’s all. That’s all. Time to get used to this  ragged teddy bear, to understand it, </em>she had thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  then, the worst thing of all: Doubt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Should  you really have to get used to somebody that you love?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  might have told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei,  they found when they entered the lobby, was speaking with Kiyomi and  Satoi at a table in the small coffee shop. Yumi couldn’t see the  proprietors’ faces, but she saw one of them holding a handkerchief  to her mouth.  Sei looked more serious than Yumi had seen her  in…maybe ever.  More serious, and more gentle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was something in that gentleness that called to her. <em>You won’t  need to get used to that, </em>it said. <em>You can just fall down into  it and forget everything.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  did her best to put that away, as well. It was harder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s  wait by the exit,” Rei said quietly, startling Yumi, making her  jump.  “We don’t want to distract them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  are they talking about?” Yoshino asked, and Rei put her head on the  girl’s head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing  you need to concern yourself with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yoshino  frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Call  it laying old demons to rest,” Sachiko said. Her voice was raspier  than Yumi was used to, and raspier than it had been in the  hallway—had something happened, so close under her nose, without  her noticing? Instinctively, she moved slightly closer to Sachiko,  worry niggling in the back of her head as though it was the most  natural thing in the world. “I think that would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei  nodded her agreement.  “In any case, it’s a private matter, so  let’s let them be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>What  could it be, though? It looks like they’re…crying. It looks like  Sei is having a hard time not doing the same, in fact. I don’t  think I’ve ever even seen Sei come close to crying. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Something  heavy set gently on Yumi’s head, and Sachiko murmured in her ear,  “Privacy is something you need for the times when you have to let  your guard down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  understood, and understood more than that, too.  Because even though  that hand of Sachiko’s was heavy, it, too, was gentle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe  that was what being with the people you truly loved was. Maybe that  was friendship in a nutshell. Maybe it was none of the millions of  convoluted metaphors that would-be philosophers had assigned it over  the years; maybe it wasn’t companionship or camaraderie, or the  feeling of <em>belonging. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe it  was just something gentle that knew when to leave you alone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei came  back to them five minutes later, smiling as wide as she dared without  risking exposure of the gentle quiver of her lips. Her face was  bright and perky and, to Yumi, obviously fake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As they  went to the front desk to wait for Kiyomi and Satoi to collect  themselves, Shimako took Sei’s hand, squeezed it once, and then  released it. Sei responded by putting a hand on the girl’s head for  a moment, and then letting it drop again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe,  Yumi thought, that was the form of Sei’s teddy bear.  A simple  touch, and a simple response. <em>I’m here, you know. Yes, and thank  you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was  in this manner that they checked out of the hotel, quiet and  supportive of those who seemed to need it. After they began to move  towards the door, Sachiko lingered for a moment at the desk, and  spoke to Kiyomi and Satoi directly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">For a  moment, they looked at each other in silence, and then Sachiko spoke,  quietly, but without hesitation, as a lady ought to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did  you find what you were looking for?” is what she asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kiyomi  nodded.  “We did. Did you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  think so. I hope so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  smiled, and then bowed and excused herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever  it is, when you do find it,” Satoi said, just loud enough to be  heard by Sachiko, “don’t duck it at the last minute. It becomes  far too comfortable sitting on the floor instead of standing up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  stopped, and turned her entire body, so that she did not appear to be  speaking on an off-note, impolitely.  “I know,” she said with a  smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And that  was that.  And for the first time in many months, the only feeling  that Sachiko could find inside of her was optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Precisely  the feeling that Yumi was struggling to find within herself, for the  first time in years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As they  loaded into the car, Yoshino said, completely out of the blue, as  though acting in Sei’s place, “So, Yumi, did Sachiko talk in her  sleep?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  jerked to a halt, and both Rei and Sei burst into the kind of  laughter one only finds in oneself when one cannot quite believe what  is being heard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  blinked twice, floating to the surface of her mind again, where she  belonged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now  that you mention it,” Yumi said, and then a funny memory came to  her.  “She did.”  Yumi turned to face Sachiko. “<em>Onee-sama,</em>what exactly were you dreaming about, do you remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What…what  was I saying?” Sachiko said hesitantly, almost afraid to hear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was almost frightening,” Yumi said. “You kept rolling around, and  then you said, <em>I can’t hear you, talk to two by four.</em> Do you  know what that means?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  blinked twice, memories of her dream drifting in and out of a place  where she could see them—memories of blood and violence—and then  her phone began to ring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  froze.  There was precisely one person that would be calling her at  this point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  spoke up, life returning to her in an instant. “Don’t answer  that,” she said. “Give it to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  did as she asked. She was, honestly, terrified of answering it  herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  opened the phone. “Hello?” A moment’s pause.  “Nope, she’s  sleeping.” A pause. “In a ditch. In the car, where do you think?”  Sei grinned while the person on the other end said something, and  Yumi and Yoshino held in laughter.  “About halfway to Kyoto…Three  days, if I feel like it. Whups, sorry, looks like this thing’s  running out of batteries.  Sorry, Kashiwagi, we’ll have to chat it  up later.” With that, Sei shut the phone, and, for good measure,  opened the battery case and pulled the battery out, stuffed it in her  pocket, and handed the phone back to Sachiko.  The verbal sparring  with Suguru seemed to have brightened her spirits significantly. “You  can have the battery back when we get past Tokyo’s city limits.”  She considered for a second. “Or if we’re attacked by highway  bandits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  had absolutely no idea what to say to this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And so,  even though it was Sei, and even though the idea was absolutely  preposterous, she simply nodded. “Fair,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  grinned, and the sight of this was refreshing in many ways, to many  of the people in the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then,  shall we get our pretty little selves down to Kyoto? I’m still  driving, and this time you can’t complain, since I’m probably the  only one not hung over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not hung over,” Rei pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  a pansy behind the steering wheel,” Sei countered.  “I’d like  to get to Kyoto this year, thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I am  not!” Rei said. It was as close as Sachiko had ever heard to  indignant out of Rei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Rei,  you <em>are </em>the old lady that deliberately drives on one-lane  highways just to see how long of a snake’s tail she can pick up.  You are seventy-five at the age of nineteen.” And before Rei could  come up with something to say to this, Sei was in the drivers’  seat. She had apparently pilfered the keys from Rei at some point,  though when, nobody could precisely say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe it  was a testament to Sei’s character, or maybe it was simply timing,  that it was at precisely the time when everybody filed into the van  and nobody was watching her that Sei whispered, <em>thank you, </em>her  voice barely a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">After  all, even Sei couldn’t help how she felt sometimes.  Even Sei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Everybody  was like that sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  pulled out of the parking lot and tore off down the highway.  One  hundred and seventy miles to Kyoto, a sign informed them shortly  thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  found herself wishing for a power of ten to multiply that by.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She was  not the only one.</span></p>
