<p><em>You  love him, don’t you? </em>she said. <em>It must be hard to marry the  one you love when you know they don’t love you in return. </em></p>
<p><em>Please  remember that this marriage has been arranged by your parents, and  that any difficulties might upset them greatly, </em>he said. <em>They  are providing us with much to be thankful for, so you would do well  to begin being thankful now. </em></p>
<p><em>If  you’re determined to go to university, then Suguru will, as well,  so that you can be together there, </em>they said.<em> This union will  not wait for some useless scrap of paper displaying your knowledge to  the world like a cheap banner. </em></p>
<p>None of  them really understood.  But of those who did not understand, only  Yumi came within a field’s length of understanding.  Only Yumi.</p>
<p>Suguru  didn’t understand that it wasn’t the word <em>marriage </em>that  had hurt her when he said it.  It was the word <em>arranged. </em>It  was the way he said it like it was something normal, but normal like  a pap smear was normal.  Normal and not spoken of.</p>
<p>Her  relatives, the key members of the Ogasawara group; they didn’t  understand that she wasn’t going to university to escape what they  wanted her to be.  It was to try and merge that with what it was that <em>she </em>wanted to be.</p>
<p><em>And  Yumi...</em></p>
<p>Yumi  didn’t understand how she could be both right and wrong at once.  She didn’t understand the depths of Sachiko Ogasawara’s hatred  for Suguru Kashiwagi, nor the magnitude of her love for him.  Nobody  understood that, least of all Sachiko herself, though certainly not  for lack of trying.  The true issue was not her hatred for men, after  all. It was her hatred for the men she loved.</p>
<p>Her  grandmother had told her before she died that it was a family trait.</p>
<p>If that  was true, Sachiko wasn’t sure she wanted to be a part of her family  anymore.  Not that she could escape it; running away from rich people  was even harder than running away from taxes, because rich people  were allowed to be ruthless, while the government forced itself to  limit its methods to ‘methodical’, only half of the two necessary  ingredients for ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Sachiko  didn’t know what the second ingredient was, but she had been told  that being the trophy wife to a very rich, very powerful man would  soon teach her. She wasn’t sure she wanted to learn. Maybe that was  why she wanted to go to get a degree in Japanese Literature, and then  move on to a Master’s degree in Japanese Language with an emphasis  in creative writing.  So that she could write her own definition of  what <em>ruthless </em>was.</p>
<p>Or maybe  she just wanted to have someplace to retreat to.  The true blessing  of the learned is that they can always retreat to their learning; the  higher pay is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>These  were things that Sachiko Ogasawara contemplated silently over her  tea, every night before bed.  She contemplated them, and other  things, in front of her fiancé, and he never knew, because he  never cared to find out.  He had told her many times that he loved  her, and she thought that maybe he had even meant it once or twice,  but it had never been enough to allow him access to her bed; not that  he would want such a thing, in any case.  She knew that on their  wedding night, they would probably have to do their matrimonial duty  to each other—if only because <em>both </em>families would be  watching them so closely that they might as well be in the room with  them—and, failing some ovarian curse, that would be the only time  that they would even sleep in the same room.</p>
<p>Tonight  was no different from any other summer evening: The sky had melted  into a full, rich hue of dark, dark blue, splattered with myriad  shadows of white clouds which contrasted the moon and the dim stars  with sometimes breathtaking beauty.</p>
<p>It was  breathtaking to Sachiko, anyway.  She didn’t know how her fiancé  felt about it, because she, like him, never cared to find out.</p>
<p>He  sometimes spoke of it, as he did tonight.  “The moon is lovely  tonight, don’t you think?” he said, his deep, rich voice as  soothing to her as it was repulsive. “Although the clouds make it  seem like it will rain soon.”</p>
<p>“Yes,”  she replied, falling back on the training that the Lillian School for  Girls had supplied her.  “It is.”  That one irreplaceable truth,  the ultimate fall-back option: If you have nothing to say, or if you  do not wish to speak to the person who demands that you speak to  them, simply agree pleasantly with whatever it is that they are  talking about.  They will think, <em>ah, what a fine lady, </em>and you  may think whatever it is that you like. Sachiko had many things to  think about, some of which did in fact concern Suguru, of which  very few were particularly flattering.</p>
<p><em>And  what about you? </em>The thought appeared in her head without warning. <em>If he retreats to his...</em>she had often pondered what to call a  male mistress, however, and had yet to come to a conclusion…<em>to  satisfy his …needs—</em></p>
<p>—a  lady does not speak of such things in public—</p>
<p><em>Where  will you satisfy yours?</em></p>
<p>Sachiko  thought first, ironically enough, of Sei Satou. Certainly not due to  any lasting impressions the girl had made on her, either romantically  or sexually; she would be more likely to seek out Youko’s help if  all it was was <em>sex, </em>or even some sweet illusion of love, that  she would be looking for. No, she thought of Sei because of how she  knew Sei would react if she were to simply show up at her doorstep  and beg for Sei’s affections for the night: Sei would simply smile,  invite her inside, and hug her gently for a minute or two, and then  remark, in a way that was not snide but was equally not polite or  coddling, that she should probably go talk to Yumi, and that she, Sei  Satou, would even be so kind as to escort her over to make sure she  got there without angsting all over too many random passer-by.  She  wouldn’t mean any of the hurtful comments; she would just say them,  because that was how she was; but at the same time, Sachiko’s pride  would be satisfied by what would inevitably turn into a form of  repartee, if only because Sachiko would never, ever “angst all  over” anybody.</p>
<p>And  then…just maybe…</p>
<p>“Sa-chan?”  her fiancé said with a note of concern to his voice.  She  looked up at him and smiled politely. <em>Suguru Kashiwagi, 19</em>,  she thought musingly.<em> Very nice to meet you for this business  venture. Please take care of me while I rip your sill-beating heart  from your chest and consume it whole. </em>“I’m going to bed.”  The note was gone.  Maybe it had never been there.</p>
<p><em>Funny, </em>she thought. <em>For a moment, he even sounded concerned. </em></p>
<p>“Good  night,” she said.  “Sleep well.” <em>Simply agree politely…</em></p>
<p><em>Bitterness  is unbecoming of a lady.</em></p>
<p>He  smiled.  “I trust you will as well. Please don’t stay up too  late, or you’ll be tired tomorrow.”</p>
<p>For a  moment, Sachiko recognized something in his voice, something familiar  to her; perhaps they had taught him how to be a proper lady at that  boys’ school of his as well?</p>
<p>She  wasn’t allowed to smile at that thought until he was out of sight.</p>
<p>As soon  as he was gone, she leaned back in her chair, just slightly, allowing  her neck to crane backwards so that she could see the stars more  easily; they really were beautiful tonight.</p>
<p><em>I  want to go for a drive, </em>Sachiko thought without warning. <em>I  want to drive as far away from here as I can, and I want to see the  stars from somewhere outside this</em></p>
<p>compound</p>
<p><em>house. </em></p>
<p>Unfortunately,  Sachiko Ogasawara could not drive.  People drove her places; butlers,  chauffeurs, people like that. <em>On one occasion, even Su…even  Kashiwagi drove me somewhere. </em>An incident she was not likely to  repeat.  Ever.</p>
<p><em>Can  I walk somewhere, instead? </em>She wondered, and then immediately  chastised herself for it. <em>One does not simply walk out of prison. </em>There were limits as to where she could go. Boundaries.  Far  ones, yes; her family owned a large stretch of land, and nobody was  likely to stop her from wandering about, but there were walls  eventually, and security guards.  The Ogasawara family was not known  for its trusting sentiments.  Perhaps earlier, she would have been  allowed to simply leave.  Before she expressed an interest in going  to University, anyway.</p>
<p><em>Or  perhaps simply before they planned the wedding date.</em></p>
<p>That  word forced her stomach into a knot every time it passed through her  mind; <em>wedding.</em></p>
<p>Suguru had said to her, <em>if this is to be a marriage of  convenience, then we can be married without interfering in each  other’s lives. </em>Maybe that didn’t bother him, but then, she  thought privately, in the same part of her brain that nurtured her  devout Catholicism, Suguru also stopped, put his hands together, and  said a brief prayer in front of a statue of Buddha every morning  during his thirteen years of mandatory schooling.</p>
<p><em>But  that’s not the only reason you don’t want to marry him…</em></p>
<p>Maybe it  was pretentious of her to think something like that, or maybe even  something worse than that, but, ironically, it had been one of her  most treasured thoughts ever since her marriage had been announced to  her by her parents.</p>
<p><em>And  maybe…just maybe, it’s a little hypocritical of you, too. </em></p>
<p>Oddly  enough, this had become one of her most treasured thoughts of late,  too.</p>
<p>The  voice that interrupted her thoughts was respectful, yet utterly  disinterested. It was their head butler’s foremost talent. “Miss  Sachiko? There is a phone call for you.”</p>
<p><em>Ah,  yes.  The Ogasawara family’s most recent invention: The phone  servant.</em> They had rerouted all calls to a single phone, which  could then be transferred to any other phone in the house. They paid  a man (or woman, Sachiko had no idea) to answer this phone and  transfer it to the nearest available butler, who would give it to  whoever was asked for. The phone-servant would do this, but their  prime function, Sachiko knew, was to remember the voice and relate it  to a caller-ID. Perhaps her relatives were now concerned that she was  getting illicit phone calls from her…</p>
<p><em>ex-</em></p>
<p>petite  seour?  The thought made her want to smile.</p>
<p><em>A  lady should move slowly and deliberately.  The hem of her skirt  should always be tidy. </em></p>
<p>Indeed,  even now, Sachiko was wearing a skirt, and it was, indeed, tidy, as  she stood from her seat, gently, and walked slowly to the head  butler, who displayed no impatience. He handed her the phone when she  stopped moving, and then bowed and vanished somewhere.</p>
<p>“Ogasawara  residence,” she said politely, even though she knew whoever she was  speaking to had heard it already from the phone-servant.  “This is  Sachiko speaking.”</p>
<p>“Sachiko!”  the voice maintained just the vaguest hint of the kind of formality  that she would have expected of the girl on the other end of the  line, the only girl in existence that could possibly have made her  smile in quite the way that she was suddenly smiling now. She had,  after all, trained her <em>petite seour </em>better than this.</p>
<p>“How  many times,” Sachiko said gently, allowing the grin on her face to  extend to her voice, “must I remind you to call me <em>onee-sama</em>,  Yumi?”</p>
<p>“I—I’m  sorry, <em>onee-sama</em>,” Yumi seemed a bit taken aback, which was  to be expected of the girl.  She had a tendency to react rather  exaggeratedly to most anything.  “I called because I wanted to  ask…ah…” she broke off; her nervousness was practically  radiating off of her voice.  Sachiko could envision just about  exactly what her face looked like right then.</p>
<p>All at  once, Sachiko had about a million things she wanted to say to Yumi.  It had been nearly a month and a half since her graduation, and she  hadn’t had a chance to see Yumi since then, and all of a sudden,  her head was filled with words.</p>
<p>She  spoke none of them.  Rather, she said, “What was it you wanted to  ask me, Yumi?” gently. <em>Prompt, but do not demand. </em>What’s  up <em>and </em>what is it <em>are not acceptable ways to begin a  conversation. </em></p>
<p>At  some point, the line between what her family and what Lillian taught  her about being a lady had blurred in her mind; she could no longer  distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>“Oh!  Yes!” Yumi blurted. Sachiko could hear her forcing her voice to be  something other than a blurt, and after a moment, she continued, more  controlled this time, “I called because I wanted to …to invite  you to come on a picnic with Yoshino, Shimako, Rei, and I. On the,  ah…the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>It was  strange.  Yumi had improved vastly in her discipline in her second  year at Lillian; she would rarely have made this much of a fool of  herself there. Somehow, this warmed Sachiko’s heart just a little.</p>
<p>She  didn’t allow herself to react that way to the invitation, however.  “I would very much like to,” she replied calmly, and from there,  the details were worked out in an unexciting manner; They would all  make their respective ways to the bank of a river not far from  Sachiko’s house—really, the driveway would be the bulk of her  trip—and eat there at one in the afternoon. After that, they would  retire to the house of someone with whom Sachiko was familiar—a  friend of her grandmother’s, who had seen her just before her  passing—and have tea there.</p>
<p>Sachiko  made her promises, and hung up shortly after.  Somehow, the head  butler was there only a moment after the phone <em>beeped </em>off to  take it from her. Perhaps this should have unnerved her, but it  didn’t. Not now.</p>
<p>She was  going to see Yumi, after all.</p>
<p>For the  first time in more than a month, she was going to see Yumi.</p>
<p><em>Yumi.</em></p>
<p>Then  she banished the thought and went back outside to consider the stars  for a moment longer.  They seemed, somehow, even more inviting than  they had before.</p>
<p>Sachiko  slept peacefully that night.  Moreso than she had in weeks, and  though she looked, the next day, precisely the same as she had the  day before, she was utterly different inside.</p>
<p><em>Yumi.</em></p>
