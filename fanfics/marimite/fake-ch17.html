<p align="center">Authors  notes</p>
<p align="center">Sometimes  the Japanese call a dance club a <em>disco</em>. (Literally: Di-su-ko.  Ouch, right?) I have, however, omitted this in favor of the more  accessible <em>club, </em>as for an American reader the word <em>disco </em>is likely to conjure up shades of the seventies or, if one is  moderately well traveled, Central and South America and their  sometimes-infamous <em>discoteca. </em> (I, by the way, am not so  well-traveled. I’m still taking donations.)</p>
<p align="center">Let’s  not forget the fun little dual-meaning of <em>powdering one’s nose</em>.  I mean the one that <em>doesn’t </em>have to do with cocaine.</p>
<p align="center">With  regard to office ladies: What is expected of women in Japan  (moderately recently, anyway) is that they will work until they are  married, at which time they will quit and take care of the house and  kids. This sort of person is called a <em>sengyoushufu. </em>Although  recently (in the last fifteen years), the concept of the <em>kengyoushufu</em> (essentially a working mother)has appeared, this can be a  very stressful lot in life as many Japanese women are still expected  to shoulder the brunt of the housework and child-rearing  responsibilities in a family, as well as the utterly inexplicable <em>otto no seiwa wo suru,</em> or “taking care of the husband.”  This <em>sengyoushufu </em>idea, coupled with some serious undertones  of sexism still in Japanese society, has led to many female workers  being hired as ‘office ladies,’ whose function is to do things  like make tea and take memos. (They are basically glorified –or  perhaps not so glorified—secretaries. It is not a pretty part of  Japanese society.</p>
<p align="center">In  Japanese society, it is not uncommon to make polite small-talk about  the weather. Often times, instead of saying something like, “How  are you?” (The nearest Japanese translation of which is considered  something to say to a friend whom you haven’t seen in a while—a  few days, usually) a person with whom you are friendly will comment  to you on the weather when you see each other for the first time that  day.</p>

<p align="center">How far  we’ve come</p>
<p>Yoshino  flopped down on the bed the moment she entered the room, and Rei  tried not to worry about it; after all, it had been a long trip, and  a long drunk, too. Yoshino had gotten much, much better since her  surgery—she rarely had to skip school anymore, and never because  she was simply too weak to do much more than get out of bed. Rei had,  therefore, tried to tell herself that it was okay to not worry as  much, even if Yoshino had to sit down or nap from time to time to get  rid of a little fever or some dizziness.</p>
<p>Even so,  it was hard. It was sixteen-odd years of experience versus maybe two,  if that. Before, if Yoshino had had to sit down—<em>had to</em>—there  had been a decent chance she wouldn’t be able to get up for a  couple of hours without feeling dizzy or feverish. It had been  stressful and scary, to say the least, and that kind of feeling  leaves an impact on a person. Even now, Rei found herself checking  herself sometimes to make sure she wasn’t handling Yoshino with kid  gloves.</p>
<p><em>She’s  a grown girl now. She’ll be graduating at the end of the year. She  probably won’t even stick around after that. If I were in her  position, I probably wouldn’t, </em>Rei thought this as Yoshino laid  down with a grunt, and her heart sank a little. She had known this  plenty well from the very day Yoshino had had her surgery—that  since she was able to, she would certainly spread her wings, which  meant putting Rei not at arm’s length, but at wing’s length.</p>
<p><em>There’s  no use thinking about it. You can’t do a thing, and if you try,  you’ll only push her away faster.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s  the problem with family. People will stay in town for friends, but if  it’s family, there’s something else there…some extra feeling of </em>well, they have to love me, so it’s okay if I ditch them for a  while.</p>
<p><em>Or forever.</em></p>
<p><em>Stop  thinking about it, Rei.</em></p>
<p>“You  feeling all right?” Rei asked, coming to the bed and sitting down  gently next to Yoshino.</p>
<p>“Yeah,”  Yoshino replied, her voice a little hoarse. “Just hung over.”</p>
<p><em>Was  it worth it? Tsk tsk. </em></p>
<p><em>Don’t  say it. You need to…</em></p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>A moment  of silence, and then, from Yoshino, “That’s it?”</p>
<p>“What’s  it?”</p>
<p>“Mmm?  That’s all I get? No, <em>was it worth it? </em>No, <em>you know your  body can’t handle that kind of thing?</em> Just <em>mm</em>?”</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged. “You’re making your own decisions now, Yoshino. I’m  not your mom.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  scowled and turned over. “What the hell. That doesn’t suit you at  all.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,”  Rei said. “But maybe it ought to.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  sat up. She put a hand over Rei’s, and smiled. “You’re an  idiot, Rei.”</p>
<p>Rei took  a minute to look at Yoshino. Her face was pale and her body was  obviously bitching at her about sitting up so suddenly. Her eyes,  though, were grinning, just as clearly as her mouth. They masked no  falsehood, and were not often able to. And Rei loved that. It wasn’t  always easy being friends with people like Sei and Sachiko, who so  consistently masked their feelings from everybody, so that Rei often  found herself acting the adult in order to get them to discuss their  feelings rationally. Sometimes she felt like a mother not just to  Yoshino, but to everybody, and she knew that that was both arrogant  and self-centered, but she couldn’t help it. Maybe it was in her  nature.</p>
<p>So she  was an idiot. And here was Yoshino, a girl who, despite her surgery,  didn’t have a body strong enough for a night of heavy drinking and  then a day of moderate activity, but who regardless was doing her  best to comfort such an idiot. And that, in itself could not be  anything but stupid.</p>
<p>“And  you’re related to me. That means it runs in the family.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  laughed. “We should probably never have children.”</p>
<p>Rei  thought she was probably right. If Rei was turned out to be as  overbearing a mother as her own parent, she would probably just  produce another one of herself and the cycle of idiocy would  continue.</p>
<p>If she  had said that to Yoshino, she might have received a thump upside the  head.</p>
<p>Yoshino  might have said that the world needed more of Rei.</p>
<p>Something <em>smashed </em>outside their room. A massive, overpowering crack,  like wood snapping over God’s knee, startling them both, but  scaring neither. Thunder. Rei looked out the window, as did Yoshino.</p>
<p>Rain,  again. It must have taken its head start after the hotel and used it  to find a good spot to wait near Kyoto. God was a clever bastard when  he put his mind to it.</p>
<p>“Son  of a bitch,” Yoshino murmured.</p>
<p>“Something  the matter?” Rei asked.</p>
<p>“You  blind <em>and </em>stupid?” Yoshino nudged Rei’s sides. “It’s  raining.”</p>
<p>Rei put  her arms around her cousin and brought her tight to her breast. “And  there’s not a thing in the world wrong with that.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  let herself be held for a moment, and then spoke into Rei’s shirt,  distinctly less soft than the breast underneath, but just as warm.  “You think?”</p>
<p>“I  know. It’s pretty to look at, and it’s not as though it’ll stop  us from going out if we want. Not that I think you ought to be doing  that anyway.”</p>
<p>“No  way I’m going to miss out on a live house tonight.”</p>
<p>Rei  started to say something, and then stopped. Yoshino said, “Go on,  say it. You won’t feel right until you do.”</p>
<p>Rei  smiled, felt her heart warm, and hoped that this was something that  Yoshino could feel in spite of the breast, bra, and shirt between  them. “You’re not going if you don’t feel better. I won’t  have you collapsing in the middle of a club.”</p>
<p>“It’s  not a club, it’s a live house.”</p>
<p>“It’s  got loud music and a balance of people trying to kill one another and  people trying to have sex with one another. It’s close enough.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  smiled again, suppressing the urge to laugh, and then dislodged  herself from Rei and flopped back down on the bed. “You talk like  you’ve got experience.”</p>
<p>“I  have. Every mother has, that’s how they’re allowed to be mothers.  That’s what youth is—doing things you won’t want to tell your  kids about in twenty years.”</p>
<p>Yoshino  smiled. “Rei, the day you turn into my mother I’m dropping out  and joining the military or the circus.”</p>
<p>Rei  blinked, honestly surprised. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You  really think you act like my mother?”</p>
<p>“Don’t <em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>Yoshino  shrugged. “Sometimes you act like everybody’s mother, but mostly  with me, I guess I see you as a caring friend and distant relative.”</p>
<p>“Distant?”  Rei frowned. They were first cousins and <em>neighbors, </em>for God’s  sake. How much closer could they be? <em>Or does she mean something  else? </em>She didn’t want to think about it.</p>
<p>Yoshino  grinned at Rei, a little glint of <em>something </em>in her eye.</p>
<p>“Well,”  she said with an impish smile. “I prefer to think of us as not  being <em>too </em>closely related.”</p>
<p>Rei  smiled and pondered that serenely for a while as Yoshino fell asleep  to the sound of rain outside of their window. Somehow, the occasional  cracks of thunder only made her feel more at peace.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Stubbornness  was generally not considered an attractive trait in a Lady, as it was  often considered to be synonymous with <em>obstinate, </em>which was,  by many standards, simply a more sophisticated way to say <em>annoying. </em></p>
<p>If  there was one thing Sachiko had always struggled with, (and there  was) it was this; Sachiko was a strong-willed woman, and she always  had been. And out of those who were strong of will, even the most  patient had their moments when they would have characterized  themselves as stubborn. If she had been asked, she could have called  up several recent examples of times in which she had had to force  herself (against stubborn resistance, at that) to yield to somebody  whom she was quite certain was in the wrong, simply to prevent  herself from appearing too stubborn. Or perhaps from <em>feeling</em> too stubborn.</p>
<p>And so,  because of this trait which she was adept at suppressing only on days  when she had prepared herself to do so (which, in fairness, was most  days, but not today, having woken up with a hangover and a girl) she  was giving Yumi, as the younger girl would later put it, <em>a hell of  a time getting her to say more than two words in a row.</em></p>
<p>Because  Yumi was stubborn too, in her own way.</p>
<p>She  began in the usual way, when the thunder first struck. It took her  off-guard, and with Sachiko in the bathroom and thus unable to see  her, she flinched and shouted slightly in alarm (she muffled the  sound quite adeptly with one hand) and was not worried about being  chastised for it. After her heart calmed down, she said, “I think  it’s starting to rain again, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” in a voice loud  enough to be heard but not too loud to be irritating or insistent, as  per regulation. She regarded it as a success as she was ordinarily  able to get this right on the first try perhaps once in four tries.</p>
<p>“I  see,” was her answer, her voice flat. Yumi waited for a  moment—perhaps Sachiko was pondering what to say next, or perhaps  she was waiting for Yumi to speak next. These were the difficult  silences—not the painful nor the awkward ones, but the <em>I’m  done, your turn </em>silences that came about when one partner was  speaking tonelessly, as Ladies were expected to do in a situation in  which they should remain calm. Yumi thought that there ought to be  some sort of hand gesture to indicate one was done speaking in these  cases, and the image which immediately came to her mind was of  Sachiko, dressed in a flattering blue dress (because, honestly, what  dress was not flattering on Sachiko?) facing a group of faceless old  men, saying something flatly, and then waving a pair of air-traffic  flags around for a moment in a manner reminiscent of a coordinated  dance. She stifled a giggle.</p>
<p>After  another moment of nothing, Yumi frowned and said, “It seems like it  followed us here, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I  suppose.” Immediate. Toneless. One flag up, one to the left, and  then shift ninety degrees clockwise. Cleared for <em>go. </em></p>
<p><em>What  in the hell.</em></p>
<p>“Are  you excited to go out tonight?”</p>
<p>“I  suppose.”</p>
<p>Silence  again. Yumi felt the first vestiges of frustration creeping up on  her. Not an angry frustration—just frustration.</p>
<p><em>She  was fine two hours ago. What happened so quickly? </em></p>
<p><em>And  what is she doing in there? She has been in there for no less than  ten minutes. Powdering one’s nose does </em>not <em>take that long,  no matter how you use the expression. </em></p>
<p>“Are  you nearly done powdering your nose, <em>Onee-sama?</em>”</p>
<p><em>Answer </em>that <em>with an </em>I suppose.</p>
<p>Silence  for a moment. Then, “No. Do you need to use the restroom?”</p>
<p><em>Eight  words in a row. Success! </em></p>
<p>Yumi  was not a devious girl by anybody’s standards, but this was in part  because her face tended to give her plan away before it was half out  of her mouth. Therefore, with a solid, opaque door between her and  Sachiko, she was able to be sly without being noticed. “Yes,” she  said. “Badly. May I come in?”</p>
<p>“I…”  Sachiko paused. “Just a moment, please.”</p>
<p>Yumi  thought she might be better served to simply barge in, but she  didn’t. She gave Sachiko the requisite moment (equivalent to half a  minute in Lady-speak) and then gripped the doorknob and said, “I’m  entering.” When no fevered objection came from Sachiko, she opened  the door.</p>
<p>What she  found wasn’t what she expected. She had half been expecting to see  Sachiko drying her eyes frantically, trying not to look at Yumi, her  makeup streaked and a mess; she knew, after all, when Sachiko was <em>not  doing so well. </em>What she found instead was completely different:  Sachiko was simply sitting on the toilet lid, staring not at Yumi but  at the wall. Maybe behind the wall. More than this, Yumi noticed that  Sachiko was projecting that aura that she sometimes took, usually  when her mood was dark; it was an interesting thing—though Yumi had  never been the sort of off-kilter spiritualist that claimed to see  auras and spirits leaving the body, she felt she could see this, even  if she acknowledged it as simply a reaction to a set of stimulus that  her mind processed without her permission: The way Sachiko sat, her  back straight as it always was, but with her arms folded underneath  her breasts instead of set gently in her lap, her legs crossed over  one another (almost unthinkable for a proper Lady); the way she  didn’t even look up to acknowledge that Yumi had entered the room.  That, probably, more than anything else; Sachiko was nothing if not  responsive.</p>
<p>Yumi  took a breath and then went to Sachiko. It was easier than she  expected. She smiled, and put her hand on Sachiko’s.</p>
<p>Sachiko  didn’t face her. “What is it?”</p>
<p>Yumi  suddenly found it harder to smile. She didn’t stop. “I thought  I’d come in and talk to you, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“You  don’t need to use the toilet.”</p>
<p>“No.”  Yumi couldn’t help but be a little sheepish.</p>
<p>“Could  you please leave me alone, then?” Her tone was not cold, but her  words were. The opposite of her norm, but no less hurtful.</p>
<p>Yumi  took a step back. “I just thought…you could use somebody to talk  to, or…something.”</p>
<p>Finally,  Sachiko looked at her. Her gaze was not hard, but it was not soft,  either. Yumi was used to Sachiko looking at her gently, and was not  thinking clearly enough to consider that perhaps she had been spoiled  in this respect. “Right now, Yumi, I just want to be by myself a  while.”</p>
<p>This was  something that Yumi could relate to, and certainly it was not a new  sentiment coming from Sachiko. When her grandmother had died,  certainly she had taken <em>some time to herself. </em> During finals,  she had taken plenty of <em>time to herself</em>—Yumi had never seen  so little of her as during finals season at Lillian School for Girls.</p>
<p>All of  this, however, did nothing to explain to her why this time, this <em>specific </em>time, rather than just depressing her, it stung.</p>
<p>Maybe it  was because, for the first time in a long time, and certainly the  first time since they had</p>
<p><em>(oh  just say it you silly girl) </em></p>
<p>kissed,  Yumi had completely and utterly misread Sachiko.</p>
<p>“I’m  very sorry, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” Yumi said as formally as she could,  and then bowed and left as quickly as she could without ruffling her</p>
<p><em>(you’re  not wearing a)</em></p>
<p>skirt,  and shut the door behind her.</p>
<p>She sat  on the bed, and Sachiko sat on the toilet.</p>
<p>Neither  of them was at peace.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Sei  wished she smoked. It would give her an excuse to be outside in the  rain, just leaning against the wall as she was doing now. In spite of  everything, she still could not help but mind a bit when people  stared at her; and they did, because she was out of the ordinary, or  perhaps not so much so: A pretty girl, leaning against the wall of a  cheap hotel which could be rented by the hour, her hips farther  towards the sidewalk than her back, which rested against the cheap  bricking, her hands in her pockets. It was actually a position in  which Sei was able to think very clearly, but for obvious reasons,  she tended not to stand like that outside.</p>
<p><em>Oh,  and the rain doesn’t help people not stare at me. I suppose I’m  getting thoroughly soaked.</em></p>
<p>What  she thought about was simply this:</p>
<p>Suguru  was a cunning opponent. She should probably not have answered  Sachiko’s phone in the first place.</p>
<p>In a  game where you only had to be found to lose, she was probably going  to lose. Suguru wouldn’t let them go, and he had more resources  than she did and more brains than most people gave him credit for. It  wasn’t a big deal for her; she could work through her stuff with  Shimako on her own time. Probably that was for the best anyway, since  only she and Rei seemed to be capable of keeping the group entirely  on their feet (the burden of being the so-called <em>adults</em>), so  she needed to be in top form. So to speak.</p>
<p>But for  Sachiko…</p>
<p>She  didn’t want to be caught for Sachiko’s sake. Sachiko was a girl  who didn’t really get out much (though she technically did, Sei  didn’t count family events). So, when she finally did, Sei wanted  her to enjoy herself, but it was more than that.</p>
<p><em>The one night the quiet girl really cuts loose and you think that  all that time whittling away at her was maybe worth it, it’s a nice  feeling for the person who bought the booze and set the whole thing  up. But more than that, unless you can keep inviting her out, or  stick close to her for a while afterwards, she usually just tightens  up even more after that, like she’s overcompensating. I feel like  if this thing ends prematurely, we might not see the </em>good <em>Sachiko  again after she leaves for University. </em></p>
<p>Sei sighed. <em>I’m involving myself in this a bit too much. Sachiko  can take care of herself; she’s an adult now. Probably moreso than  I am. </em></p>
<p><em>But even so…</em></p>
<p>Even so, she couldn’t avoid the simple fact that she, like  everybody else in their little group, simply wanted happiness for  Sachiko.</p>
<p><em>It seems funny. There are hundreds of millions of people on this  planet who would give their firstborn—and probably any other kids  they may have—for the kind of money she was born into. This whole  thing just seems overblown sometimes. Probably Sachiko would say the  same thing.</em></p>
<p><em>But at the same time…it’s not easy being born into such a  one-track life. She has virtually no options as to where her life  will go, and while it will certainly land her in a better place than  those in poverty, she has no more choices. I don’t even think </em>I <em>could do that; to not be able to leave my house without  permission; to not be able to choose who I spend my time with; to not  be able to flirt or get shitfaced with a pretty girl; to not be able  to feel her up or fuck her depending on how rambunctious I’m  feeling that night; to not be able to tell a man who rests his hand  under your ass at a party to get fucked if he’s got enough money.  She can go to college but she can’t do shit with her degree. Even  if she does do this writing thing she talked about, she probably  won’t be allowed to publish anything, at least not till her parents  bite it and Suguru’s in charge of the company, and who knows what  he’ll say then. Maybe he’ll actually listen to her, or maybe  he’ll be okay just never seeing her at all. I wonder if </em>she’d <em>be all right with that. </em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, would it be any different if she were just an  average, middle-class woman who gets her degree, works as an office  lady making tea for fifteen years, and then retires when she gets  married to stay at home and play tennis and go learn French and  clean? She still doesn’t get to choose where she ends up, just her  man. </em></p>
<p><em>Hell. That’s depressing. Now I </em>really <em>want to take up  smoking. </em></p>
<p>Sei stood up straight, and something moved in the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“You were pondering things you would do better not to worry about,”  Shimako said by way of greeting. “Weren’t you.” It wasn’t a  question.</p>
<p>“And  just what do you mean by that?” Sei asked.</p>
<p>“Just  that you can’t always fix things by thinking hard on them. If that  were the case, the world would be a much better place.”</p>
<p>“I’m  not so sure about that.”</p>
<p>“It  would be better for me, anyway.”</p>
<p>Sei  smiled. “You want to take up smoking together?”</p>
<p>“That’s  bad for you, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“So  they tell me. But certainly it can’t be any worse for you than <em>pondering things you would do better not to worry about</em>.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.  Maybe you should come out of the rain before you catch cold.”</p>
<p><em>I can  never decide if she doesn’t give a shit what I’m thinking, or  just doesn’t think it’ll do me any good.</em></p>
<p><em>Or  maybe she </em>is <em>just concerned that I’ll catch cold. </em></p>
<p>“Maybe  I should. I guess it’s getting kind of chilly, huh.”</p>
<p>“I can  tell,” Shimako said in a musing tone. It took Sei only a moment to  remember that the shirt she was wearing had not been loose-fitting  when it was dry, and therefore left very little to the imagination  now, especially with regards to the temperature. (Though it was not  white, so she still maintained her dignity.)</p>
<p>Sei  grinned, gave a little <em>oops, </em>and, to the credit of every nun  at Lillian who had tried their very best to mold the woman into a  proper Lady, blushed and turned away from the street, folding her  arms over her breasts.</p>
<p>Shimako  smiled, and, a little shyly, took her friend by the arm and led her  inside, both of them shivering and dripping. The boy at the counter  ogled them openly, and while Shimako did her best to ignore him, Sei  flipped him a rude gesture, to the credit of every rock-and-roll  concertgoer she had ever spent more than half an hour with.</p>
<p>“That  was a terrible idea,” Sei said as she stepped into the elevator.</p>
<p>Shimako  didn’t say anything. Sei didn’t ask her to. Shimako let go of  Sei’s arm and Sei didn’t question her. She would do her own  thing.</p>
<p>The  elevator <em>dinged</em>. Shimako walked out ahead of Sei, and folded  her arms underneath her breasts.</p>
<p><em>What  in the hell? Sage advice to cold shoulder in five seconds flat? Is  she just upset about getting ogled? </em></p>
<p>They  entered their room. There was silence for a moment, in which Shimako  looked not at Sei but <em>around </em>her, willing her vision to pass  the girl entirely. After the moment had passed, she said, “Please  use the shower ahead of me, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p><em>Oh.</em></p>
<p><em>Not  this again.</em></p>
<p>Shimako  grinned as best she could. “Don’t worry. I won’t…you know. Do  that again.”</p>
<p>Shimako  was shivering as she said it. Her body was probably weaker than  Sei’s. Sei was colder, but Shimako was more likely to catch cold,  and the odds of her actually agreeing to go in before Sei were slim  to none.</p>
<p><em>And I  don’t think we’re quite ready to be showering together yet.</em></p>
<p><em>This  is going to disappoint the hell out of her.</em></p>
<p>“You  use this one. I’ll go over to…” <em>Not Sachiko’s room. As  tempting as it is with Yumi in there, no. </em>“Rei’s room and use  hers.”</p>
<p>This was  probably the kindest thing she could have done. Shimako nodded, a  little gratefully, and visibly relaxed.</p>
<p>Sei  grinned, patted her on the shoulder in what was quite possibly the  worst gesture she could have made (though she did not understand  this, for all her experience and knowledge) and left the room.</p>
<p>Rei’s  room was just down the hall, and she knocked, hoping she could get a  good reaction out of Rei.</p>
<p>She got  no such luck. Rei opened the door quietly, and whispered, “What  happened to you?”</p>
<p><em>Yoshino  must be asleep. </em>Sei whispered back, “It’s raining outside.”</p>
<p>“I  noticed. What were you doing out there?”</p>
<p>“Getting  wet.” As an afterthought, “To come over here.” By itself, this  was nothing, but Sei gave such a grin with it that Rei broke down and  smiled. “You need to use our shower, is that it?”</p>
<p>“When  did you get psychic powers?” Sei asked as Rei let her in.</p>
<p>“You  and Shimako ought not to be showering in the same room for a while.”</p>
<p>“My  question stands.”</p>
<p>“I pay  attention is all, Sei. You’d be amazed what you can catch if you  keep your eyes and ears open, and don’t look for anything specific.  I think if I wanted to think that you two were having an affair I’d  have no idea what was actually going on.”</p>
<p>Sei  smiled. She liked Rei, and this was why. Rei was probably the  brightest girl this side of the Pacific, except when it came to  Yoshino. And even then, most of the time, she had a leg up on  everyone else, Yoshino herself included.</p>
<p>“I  won’t be long.”</p>
<p>“Take  your time. You look cold.” Rei glanced at exactly the same place  Shimako had.</p>
<p>Again,  Sei blushed only a little. Maybe it was her day to be hit on by her  friends.</p>
<p>She shut  the door behind her, and Rei said, “I’ll hang your clothes up.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Closet.  Normally I’d be worried about the carpeting, but frankly, I think  that’s the last thing to worry about in these rooms.”</p>
<p>“At  least they get hot water.”</p>
<p>“For  about ten minutes.”</p>
<p>“Does  that mean there’s none left?”</p>
<p>“Just  an estimate.”</p>
<p>Sei  began to peel her clothes off—they came off a little like a second  skin. Rei brought her a towel, and Sei did not notice Rei’s eyes  dawdling a little bit. This was probably for the best. As Sei walked  into the bathroom, Rei said, “You know, you’re not going to have  dry clothes for the concert.”</p>
<p>“That’s  fine. Nothing stays entirely dry at a live house anyway.”</p>
<p>“Too  much information, my friend. I’ll dry them off with a hair dryer  after you’re out.”</p>
<p>“That’s  not entirely pleasant.”</p>
<p>“You’ll  get by.”</p>
<p>Sei shut  the door and Rei took her clothes to the small walk-in closet.  Hanging them up, she paused. <em>Hair dryer. </em></p>
<p>She  walked to the bathroom. She didn’t notice that there was no sound  from the shower. She opened the door, not bothering to peek inside  first; maybe it was just that she was too used to living with  Yoshino, around whom she felt no real sense of modesty. Regardless,  entering, she got a very good view of something about which Sei had  only recently begun to feel modest about again.</p>
<p>Rei  froze, for the first time in a long time, her eyes locked on Sei. Sei  looked back, also frozen, not really sure how to react. On the one  hand, there shouldn’t have been much to be embarrassed about; Sei  was Rei’s senior by a year, and while the two hadn’t been close,  precisely, they had been friendly, anyway. But on the other hand,  both of them suddenly felt the urge to look away, though neither  could. Both felt like deer in headlights.</p>
<p>It was  Rei who moved first, pulling the door shut quickly, putting a hand to  her chest, and taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>Sei  remained frozen for a moment.</p>
<p>They  both thought something to the effect of, <em>What in the hell was  that? </em></p>
<p>Yoshino,  who was, in truth, awake, and had been watching, thought something  distinctly different—significantly less pretty, significantly more  bitter.</p>
<p>It was  never, after all, a pretty scene when two women compared attributes  of themselves over which they had no real control.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The sun  was setting, and that was when all the naughty boys and girls came  out of their hotel rooms and flocked to Kyoto’s nightlife like  moths to a blowtorch.</p>
<p>That, at  least, was what Sachiko thought. She looked out the window, and saw  nothing but the bricking of the neighboring building. She strained  her head, and got a peek at the sidewalk—still crowded.</p>
<p>Yumi sat  on the bed, looking at Sachiko—the two had been watching television  up until this point, which had been interesting unto itself, since  Sachiko watched television perhaps once a month. This had only lasted  them so long—Sachiko had found that she was having a hard time  dealing with the awkward silence between the two of them; she had  snapped a little harshly at Yumi in the bathroom, who had simply been  trying to help, but she couldn’t quite bring herself to broach the  topic. She knew that if Yumi would only bring it up, she could  apologize on the spot, but for some reason, she felt a sort of fear  at the prospect of bringing it up herself. As if maybe Yumi would  snap at her.</p>
<p><em>This  sort of timid attitude doesn’t suit you at all. </em></p>
<p><em>But  it should. Isn’t that what the boys all want? </em></p>
<p>A  knock at their door. Sei’s voice: “We’re getting ready to go.  Are you in your Sunday best? Or, failing that, your Saturday night  best?”</p>
<p>Both of  them were dressed only in towels, having both showered after their  little ordeal (Sachiko, it turned out, was still feeling a little  sick from the previous day, as was Yumi). Yumi looked at Sachiko,  Sachiko looked at Yumi, and they both stifled a giggle, and Sachiko  felt a touch of relief. <em>It’s not so bad, maybe. Maybe I can  even, soon…</em></p>
<p>“Not  quite,” Yumi called. “Give us about ten minutes, please.”</p>
<p>“Slowpokes,”  Sei called. “I’m coming in here in ten minutes, so please feel  free to wait another nine to start dressing.”</p>
<p>Sachiko  shook her head.</p>
<p>“What?”  Yumi said, and in her voice was something Sachiko had not  expected—something which was not anger or frustration, but a little  near it.</p>
<p>“I…nothing.”</p>
<p><em>Is  she that angry?</em></p>
<p>“All  right. We should probably get changed. Would you like to use…”  Yumi stopped and shook her head. “No, I’ll use the bathroom.”  She stood up.</p>
<p>“Yumi,  I—” Sachiko paused, and then stood up. “I’m very sorry if I  offe…no, if I hurt your feelings before.” She gave a little bow.  “I really am, so don’t be angry.”</p>
<p>Yumi  shook her head. “I’m not angry, <em>Onee-sama</em>. Sometimes, it’s  just…hard when I just want to help, but get nowhere but shut out.  Please just give me a little time to get over it.”</p>
<p><em>When  you put it that way, it sounds awfully selfish.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe  it is.</em></p>
<p>Sachiko  nodded. “Please feel free to change in the bathroom.”</p>
<p>Yumi  nodded back, picked up her clothes, folded on the bed, and headed  into the bathroom. Sachiko didn’t like the way she shut the door  behind her—it was not ladylike, but that didn’t bother her. What  bothered her was that it felt deliberately so.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Suguru  was relatively sure this would be the place. It was the “big-name”  joint in Kyoto, one of the few that out-of-towners would be able to  find easily, thanks to several road signs that didn’t seem to have  been afforded to any of the other live houses in the city. After all,  with reputation came power.</p>
<p>He knew  this all too well. The problem was, with reputation also came  bitterness, because keeping up a reputation to please others meant  not living within the bounds of one’s own sanity.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“We’ll  be back,” Rei said to the boy at the front desk, who looked half  asleep. He didn’t respond, and Rei supposed that was best, since  she didn’t feel like going out of her way to knock his head around  again. They headed out the door, grateful for the break from the  rain, though not so pleased with the humidity it had brought. Sachiko  and Shimako, in particular, had noticed their hair starting to curl a  bit throughout the day, though both of them had wet heads at this  point, so it wasn’t a big deal. Sei wondered, as she stood a safe  distance from Rei</p>
<p><em>(what  in the hell was that, anyway?)</em></p>
<p><em>(I  haven’t seen anybody react to me naked like that since…maybe Rei  is not so observant as I’d thought)</em></p>
<p>if  Sachiko’s wet head, in particular, might be a blunt-force hazard at  the live house, though in the next moment, she considered that the  girl would have to start bouncing and probably head-banging for this  to be a problem, and the very idea of that made her want to giggle.</p>
<p>“How  are we getting there?” Yoshino asked, from her spot a little <em>too </em>near Rei.</p>
<p>“Walking,”  Sei responded. “You gonna be all right?”</p>
<p>“Of  course I will.” A little obstinate. Yoshino was, indeed, a  territorial beast.</p>
<p>Sei  herself felt a little bit of anxiety. She was probably being stupid,  but she couldn’t shake that phone call with Suguru. That fucker was <em>smart</em> and that fucker was <em>rich, </em>and the two together  did not make for a pleasant opponent in anything but cards, where  Goddess Luck could take a dump on any rich, smart motherfucker at any  time, and, indeed, often did. (Sei liked cards.)</p>
<p>And so  they walked. Sei tried to take Rei’s advice, and simply <em>observed</em>:</p>
<p>Shimako  and Yumi were conversing. Sachiko was walking slightly behind Yumi,  talking to nobody (Sei thought that she should probably fix that, and  indeed, began to drop back a bit in the pack). Rei was walking and  trying not to knock ankles with Yoshino, who didn’t seem to want to  move more than three centimeters away from her cousin.</p>
<p><em>Could  Yoshino have been awake? That</em></p>
<p>(what  the fuck was it)</p>
<p><em>would  certainly trigger her territorial instincts. </em></p>
<p>She  was more concerned about Sachiko, and so, moved back to talk to her.</p>
<p>“Had  another shower, did you?” Sei asked, keeping her voice pleasant.</p>
<p>“I  found I was feeling mildly ill even after breakfast, or perhaps due  to breakfast,” Sachiko responded diplomatically, not wanting,  perhaps, to say outright, <em>that Prairie Oyster was probably the  most disgusting thing I’ve ever had in my life. </em>“A hot shower  felt quite nice.”</p>
<p>“Be  careful with that hair of yours, all right? You go flinging it around  the live house too much, you could hurt somebody.”</p>
<p>Sachiko  simply stared at Sei, and Sei couldn’t help it—she laughed aloud,  quickly covering her mouth with one hand as she attracted the  attention of the rest of them, a move which was the result of years  of training and social indoctrination.</p>
<p>They  rounded a corner and saw a large, neon sign in katakana which read, <em>Taku Taku. </em>Sei said, “Okay, everybody, let’s pair up.  Remember to use the buddy system, and don’t let your partner get  lost, raped, or high, children.” She clapped her hands twice, as  though she were addressing third graders.</p>
<p>They had  advanced about five meters when they realized that Sachiko had  stopped following them. They turned around, looked at her, and found  that she was staring at a black car, parked along the sidewalk they  were taking. They looked back at the car.</p>
<p>The  window rolled down, and Suguru Kashiwagi said, very politely, “Good  evening, everybody. I trust you braved the rain successfully.”</p>
<p>He then  met Sachiko’s gaze, and said, “Sa-chan. I am glad you have had a  good time, but I think it’s time that we went home. Your parents  are very upset with me for…” he appeared to struggle with the  next words, “losing you, and they are worried that this will  translate into an appearance of my weakness before the shareholders.”</p>
<p>To Sei  this sounded remarkably sexist, but Sachiko understood. She  understood all too well.</p>
<p>She  nodded. Suguru got out of the car, and Sachiko passed the group  without a word, giving only a stray glance towards Yumi, who met it  with wide eyes that bordered on fearful.</p>
<p>Sei  moved, fast as a cat, and caught Sachiko’s arm. Sachiko stopped,  but didn’t look up.</p>
<p>“Please,”  Sachiko said, subdued. “I need to go.”</p>
<p>“The  hell you do,” Sei replied.</p>
<p>“Sei,”  Rei said. “What are you going to do? Kidnap her?” She put a hand  on Sei’s shoulder, and Yoshino stepped forward.</p>
<p>“To  hell with that,” she spat angrily, her mouth picking up the Sei’s  vulgarity in a way that ought to have made Rei uncomfortable.  “Sachiko, you’re a grown woman, you can make your own damn  choices.”</p>
<p>“She’s  right, Sei,” Rei said. Yoshino glanced at Yumi, who was looking  away. She didn’t see Yumi biting her lip, hard enough to make it  bleed.</p>
<p>Sei took  her hand off of Sachiko and said, “Okay, fine. You’re a grown  woman. Make your <em>own </em>choice.” As she said this last bit, she  looked not at Sachiko but at Suguru, who did not quite meet her gaze  as he usually did.</p>
<p>Sachiko  hesitated for a minute, a bit like a hanging computer. She took a  look at Yumi, who could not bring herself to look up. Who, in fact,  was struggling just to keep upright, by Sei’s estimate. Then she  looked at Suguru, maybe seeing something in his impassive face that  Sei couldn’t see, or maybe couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>And then  she kept walking. She took a seat in the car.</p>
<p>Suguru  allowed Sachiko to pass, and then sat down next to her. Yoshino wore  a look that was remarkably similar to that of a woman betrayed.</p>
<p>“You’re  a son of a bitch,” Sei said. “Did you know that?”</p>
<p>Suguru  met her gaze, and then, incredibly, dropped it, looking away. “I  look forward to playing cards with you again, Miss Satou.”</p>
<p>Sei did  not know what to say to that.</p>
<p>He  closed the door. The car started.</p>
<p>And in  the span of no more than two minutes, their vacation had ended.</p>
<p>It  looked like rain again.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  Amasegawa, the owner and proprietor of Velvet Rose, had rather been  hoping to act the gentleman and the hero and rescue Sachiko Ogasawara  from the clutches of this man. He had even been willing to brave the  big, scary motherfuckers he had seen come into his restaurant for  this. He had been not twenty meters behind Sachiko when she first saw  Suguru. He had made the decision to come to town after Suguru had  stopped by his place asking after Sachiko—it hadn’t sat quite  right with him. At best, he had thought, he would get to enjoy a show  by <em>Thirty Matchboxes</em>, and at worst…</p>
<p><em>Well,  this </em>is “<em>at worst.”</em></p>
<p>But then  he had seen the way she walked. The way she simply got into the car,  without any objections, save for that one glance at Yumi. And he knew  that any effort on his part would just be rubbing salt in the wound,  because she was going home, one way or another.</p>
<p>So, as  they drove off, it was all he could do to make eye contact with  Sachiko as she drove by. He didn’t smile, he only looked. He hoped  he looked sympathetic, but he couldn’t be sure. He knew, though,  that she had seen him, as well.</p>
<p>So, he,  who had taken such an unusual shine to such unusual girls who had  simply wandered into his shop, could not help Sachiko. He wanted to.  It was in his nature. But he couldn’t.</p>
<p>It was  all he could do, then, to help her friends, gathering them up, paying  special attention to Yumi, who had begun to cry very quietly—even  going so far as to put one arm around her, which she did not  reject—and lead them back to their hotel, which Rei directed them  to.</p>
<p>He spent  most of the rest of the night with Yumi, Shimako, and Sei, the latter  of whom spent most of the time holding the former’s hand while the  former fell asleep, her eyes red from crying. He met also with Rei  and Yoshino, and reinforced Rei’s insistence that there was  absolutely nothing that could be done for Sachiko at this point, in  spite of Yoshino’s fierce urges to <em>go after that motherfucker  and have his head. </em></p>
<p>Other  than that, he knew very well that there was absolutely nothing that  he could do.</p>
<p>Because,  Ryuusuke had seen the look in Suguru’s eyes when he dropped Sei’s  gaze. Rei had seen it too, and they both understood.</p>
<p>There  was nothing Suguru could do, either.</p>
<p>When you  were fucked, sometimes you were just fucked.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Very  early that morning, when everybody else had finally gotten to sleep,  Ryuusuke called Chiharu for the first time in half a year and asked  her if she would like to get a cup of coffee with a man who hadn’t  slept at all. He woke her and, apparently, her man for the night, who  sounded angry.</p>
<p>She  agreed, and they made plans to meet. When he hung up, he told her he  loved her. She paused a moment before hanging up, and he smiled,  satisfied knowing he had gotten to her a little.</p>
