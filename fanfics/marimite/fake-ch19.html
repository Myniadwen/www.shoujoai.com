<p align="center">Yes,  they do do some signal processing at Nintendo. So Ryuusuke’s not  completely stupid. :)</p>

<p align="center"><em>Who  cares who’s there to stare and tell you how to look. I’m not sure  they even know you by name. </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Who  cares who’s there to share what they think of you? Everybody here  plays the same fucking games</em></p>

<p align="center">Energy</p>
<p>Yumi  looked fairly good compared to how she’d looked the day before. Her  eyes were dry, although still red, but she was clearly alert and,  though Ryuusuke hesitated to count it as a victory, not looking as if  she wanted to simply die. Perhaps it was the hot cup of tea in front  of her. Tea had a calming effect on many people, even caffeinated  tea.</p>
<p><em>Like  beer for the soul.</em></p>
<p>The  thought made him smile. Ryuusuke was an avid beer drinker—in a way  which only one who described himself as <em>avid </em>about beer could  be. Sei—who professed a public love of sake and a private love of  very nice red wines and who considered beer, no matter where it came  from, to be little but horse piss and vinegar (and alcohol, which had  become her excuse for drinking it)—might have laughed. Rei would  have understood thoroughly.</p>
<p>They sat  in a small coffee shop on one of Kyoto’s less busy streets (though  when one compared this to the smaller towns outside of the city, one  realized that “less busy” was a truly relative term) clustered  around two tables they’d pulled together. Yoshino looked less  furious, which may have been Rei’s fault. Shimako sat next to Sei.  Yumi sat on Sei’s other side, flanked by Yoshino. Each had one of  her hands.</p>
<p>They  simply…looked better.</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  wasn’t sure how to take that. In a backward part of his mind, he  knew he didn’t like it—he felt like they should still be in  mourning for their friend. She wasn’t dead, but still. And yet,  they looked all right. Not great, but all right.</p>
<p><em>But  why </em>wouldn’t <em>you want them to be all right?</em></p>
<p><em>Because  doesn’t that mean that their affections are…I don’t know. Fake?</em></p>
<p><em>No. </em>Ryuusuke refused to believe that. Though it was his initial  reaction, something he rarely strayed from, he pushed it aside this  time, squishing whatever passed for logic in his oft-cynical brain.</p>
<p>Sei  folded her hands on the table. “So,” she said quietly. “We need  to make a decision, and we need to make it fast.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t really think there’s a decision to be made,” Rei said,  her voice gentle.</p>
<p>“And  I,” Sei replied, “think you’re a very rational, reasonable  person for saying that. I don’t think, personally, that rationality  and reason is what is what this situation begs for, but I guess  that’s what we’re going to be making a decision about.”</p>
<p>“What  are you suggesting?” Shimako asked.</p>
<p>“That  we do something fucking stupid,” Sei said with a grin. “Something  we won’t regret.”</p>
<p>“That  would what kind of stupid we’re talking about,” Shimako said.  “We’re playing a dangerous game, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“I  believe you’re the only one who called it a game.”</p>
<p>Shimako  frowned.</p>
<p>“Sei,  I understand your frustration,” Rei said, “but this is Sachiko’s  life. Not ours.”</p>
<p><em>Oh,  to hell with that shit, </em>Ryuusuke thought.</p>
<p>This was  the problem with reasonability. Because that was certainly a  perfectly reasonable answer—and a correct one, to some end. It was,  indeed, Sachiko’s life, and it was nobody’s place to interfere  with it. Therefore, anybody who did was in the wrong, and that was  the long and the short of it. That was the only conclusion a  reasonable person could arrive at—after all, Sachiko hadn’t been  kidnapped. She had walked into a car with her own two legs. She was  living her own life, and it was her life to live.</p>
<p>But <em>fuck </em>that. “Are you serious?” Ryuusuke said. Rei looked  surprised—she had rather assumed the man would be an observer in  their deliberations; after all, Sachiko wasn’t even his friend. He  barely knew her. Nobody reasonable would put themselves on the line  like that—especially not going after people as powerful as the  Ogasawaras. “You saw the way she looked going into that car. I  wouldn’t call that living <em>her </em>life, would you?”</p>
<p>“It’s  true,” Rei acknowledged, “That she was probably influenced to  some extent by…things she would be better off ignoring if she  could, but she can’t necessarily ignore them. We don’t know the  ins and outs of her life like she does.”</p>
<p>“And  we don’t need to. Hell, we’re better off <em>not </em>knowing. I  don’t want to know what kind of powerful shit I’m poking at when  I poke at it.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t think you’re quite familiar enough with the situation to be  making comments like that,” Rei said coldly. “You sound like  you’re trying to stir up trouble for the sake of looking masculine  and strong. Or perhaps simply feeling that way.”</p>
<p><em>Ouch.  And to some end, hell, she’s probably right. </em></p>
<p>“Kinda  harsh, Rei,” Sei remarked.</p>
<p>“No,”  Ryuusuke said. “She’s right. Probably part of this does go into  my own ego. I’m not sure what in the past ten years hasn’t.  Goddamn thing is like a black hole, has been pretty much all my adult  life. But I stand by what I said; this is something fundamentally  wrong with Sachiko’s life, and it’s not her own fault. It’s not  something she herself can change without understanding something  bigger about the world.”</p>
<p>“And  that is?”</p>
<p>“That  sometimes, it goes your way only if you force it to go that way. And  that you can’t always force it with good ideas. That sometimes, a  bad idea is your best friend.”</p>
<p>“That’s  ridiculous,” Rei said.</p>
<p>“Exactly,”  Ryuusuke responded. “Listen. How many of you kids grew up in  affluent families that always taught you to do the right thing? Come  on, show of hands.”<br />
  Reluctantly, every hand went up.</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  snorted. “I grew up with no father, and a mother who worked every  bit as long and hard as a male salaryman to make up for it. Even so,  we barely had enough money to get by. So what did I do as soon as my  mother died? I sold our old house. Made a good bit of money at it,  and with my grades I might have been able to take an entrance exam  for Kyoto University and pass it. Probably could have been an  engineer; I was good enough with math. I was a pretty decent student,  and I had enough money from the house to pay my way through at least  part of college. So do you know what I did with the money? I opened  up a bar in the only place I could afford land, on the outskirts of  Kyoto, where you actually have to drive to get to.”</p>
<p>“When  you put it that way,” Yumi said quietly, “It sounds like an awful  idea.”</p>
<p>“And  yet, I do a damn decent business. Maybe I don’t make as much money  as I might have if I were working for Nintendo doing signal analysis  or whatever the hell it is that engineers there do, but I make enough  to cover my expenses and have a halfway decent house. And the  difference is, I’m doing something I enjoy, instead of something  I’m good at. Because honestly, while I’m a good bartender, I’m  only a mediocre businessman, so I’m not all that cut out to own my  own place.”</p>
<p>“And  not so great a—” Sei began.</p>
<p>“Saying <em>nothing</em> of my abilities as a chef,” Ryuusuke interrupted,  shooting her a look which was half death-glare and half mental  high-five. The kind a guy gave another guy that said, <em>you got me,  nice one. </em>“But while I’m not as good at keeping my books  balanced as I was at surface integrals, I enjoy myself a lot more  where I am. So logically speaking, it was a bad idea. I’d have done  better for myself if I’d done what was expected of me and gone to  college.”</p>
<p>“And  if Chiba had been making ramen for the rest of his life instead of  singing in Beck, he’d have been doing what was expected of him,  too,” Yoshino chimed in, an impish grin on her face.</p>
<p>“I  thought you only thought they were so-so.”</p>
<p>“I  lied.”</p>
<p>“You’re  a little shit.”</p>
<p>“She  does her best,” Rei said, her icy exterior fading a bit. “So  you’re telling us to…what?”</p>
<p>“To  encourage bad ideas in Sachiko. To do so by way of a terrible idea  yourself. If only because good ideas have insofar not been effective  in the least. I don’t mean bad like, deliberately stupid—not like  finding two tablets apiece of bad acid, downing them, and then  writhing in agony on the floor at her wedding bad. I mean like,  direct in a way which would normally be considered both impolite and  potentially stupid bearing in mind that these people are just a bit  richer than god.”</p>
<p>“Direct,  huh,” Sei said with a grin. “I like it.”</p>
<p>“You  would,” Rei said.</p>
<p>“You  should.”</p>
<p>“You  agree with him?” Rei was incredulous. “Honestly?”</p>
<p>Sei  looked Rei square in the eye. “Yes. Stupid ideas have their place  in our lives. Hell, coming out here was a stupid idea when you think  about it. It was a huge waste of money and we didn’t even get to  see a live show. We just got piss drunk and wound up drinking the  shit that this man,” she jerked her head in Ryuusuke’s direction,  “made us to cure it. We could have had a nice quiet couple of days  hanging out at Sachiko’s house and talking.”</p>
<p>“But  you saw Sachiko there. She wasn’t even sort of able to be hers…”  Rei leaned back in her chair all of a sudden, dropping off in  midword. She ran her hand through her hair once, as though  distressed. “I’m an idiot.”</p>
<p>“No,  you’re not,” Yoshino smiled. “You’re just sensible. That’s  got its place too, doesn’t it.” It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>Rei  looked at Yoshino—regarded her, really—in a way she never had  before: As an adult. Somebody who had, in fact, gotten where she  needed to be not just a few steps ahead of Rei but several miles.  Somebody who understood, maybe, a little of how the world was, not  only how she wanted it to be.</p>
<p><em>Damn.</em></p>
<p>Rei  sighed and leaned back. “You guys all caught on ahead of me, huh.”</p>
<p>Shimako  said, “It was a first. I believe it felt a bit nice.”</p>
<p>“You’re  a shit,” Sei said.</p>
<p>“An  honest one,” Shimako replied with a small smile.</p>
<p>Rei  looked at Yumi. It was really her, after all, who would clinch this.  “Do you agree, Yumi?” she asked. “Do you think this is what we  should do? Something <em>stupid</em>?”</p>
<p>Yumi  said slowly, “I think…it would be very hard to do nothing. And I  also think that everything else that makes sense has already been  tried, because, really, there isn’t much to try that hasn’t  already been tried.”</p>
<p>“What  do you mean?”</p>
<p>Yoshino  grinned and squeezed Yumi’s hand. The two had to have a psychic  connection; of this both Rei and Ryuusuke were quite certain.  Ryuusuke envied it.</p>
<p>Rei did  too, but for a different reason.</p>
<p>“I  mean,” Yumi said, her voice shaking a bit, “I’m really…really  sick of just sitting there and letting <em>Onee-sama…</em>” she  shook her head. “No, that’s not right.”</p>
<p>“Sure  it is,” Yoshino said, her eyes fiery. “What Yumi was going to  say, but is too much of a lady to, is that she’s sick of letting  Sachiko fuck her life up by being such a damn wimp. And, if we’re  going to help her get her life back on track, we’re going to have  to grow an iron pair and just tell her what’s what.”</p>
<p>There  was dead silence for a moment. Nobody was quite certain that they  believed they had just heard Yoshino tell everybody to grow a pair.</p>
<p>Nobody,  that is, except Rei. If anybody was going to tell them that, it would  be Yoshino, who possessed a rock-hard pair herself. She always had.</p>
<p><em>Damn. </em></p>
<p>“I  think that deserves a toast,” Sei said, also grinning. “Anybody  got any booze?”</p>
<p>“Tell  you what,” Ryuusuke said. “You girls go bust up what needs to get  busted up, I’ll buy you all rounds and we can toast to our hearts  content. Besides, it’s not even noon yet.”</p>
<p>“And  yet, in California, it’s almost six in the morning.”</p>
<p>“That…doesn’t  mean anything,” Ryuusuke pointed out.</p>
<p>“It <em>would </em>mean I was just getting warmed up.”</p>
<p>Shimako  snorted. “It would mean you had been passed out on a couch for at  least five hours,<em> Onee-sama</em>,” she said.</p>
<p>Sei  grimaced. Shimako had her number. She always had.</p>
<p>It  didn’t matter. She took Shimako’s hand, and said, “Well, what  the hell are we pissing around here for?”</p>
<p>“We’re  going…right now?” Rei said, frowning a bit.</p>
<p>“Why  the hell not? Can you think of something better to do?”</p>
<p>“We  don’t have any time to waste anyway,” Yumi said. “If we give  Sachiko too much time, she’ll…she won’t go along with it.”</p>
<p>“Too  much time to get set in her ways,” said Rei. “I know the drill.”</p>
<p>As one,  they stood. Ryuusuke grinned at them, said, “I think I can manage  closing the shop up for a day or so.”</p>
<p>Rei  frowned. “I don’t know if that’s a great idea. The Ogasawara  group manages your property, don’t they?”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  blinked. “How’d you know?”</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged. “They manage a lot of land around here. I didn’t, but I  do now.”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  frowned. “Eh. I ran into that Suguru guy already. I’m not  worried.”</p>
<p>Yumi  shook her head. “No, I think you need to stay here.”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  blinked. “Why?”</p>
<p>“This  isn’t…something you can really help with. You’ve done a lot  already, and we’re very grateful, but…do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  shook his head. “Not really.”</p>
<p>Sei  said, “Put it this way. We’re going in to fight, but it’s going  to be a fight mostly comprised of a bunch of girly bullshit. Nothing  personal, but there’s not a lot of shared ground between us, you  know? I think the extent of it would be, ‘hey, remember that one  time I made you a prairie oyster and you almost puked it up?’”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  hated to admit it, but she did have him there. He sighed.</p>
<p>“This  is going to eat at me, you know.”</p>
<p>“Can I  help by telling you we’ll call if we need you?” Sei asked.  “Because, while we’re really grateful for your help…that’s  about all I can do in return.”</p>
<p>Ryuusuke  had been dumped by enough women to know when he was being dumped,  but…something about this felt a little better. Maybe it was the  note of discontent in Sei’s voice when she said it.</p>
<p>Because,  honestly, that was the thing about getting dumped. Usually the person  doing the dumping was, in the long run, right. And it sucked, but…if  it felt like inevitability from the very beginning, rather than like  one person being a bastard, it was easier to take.</p>
<p>A  little, anyway.</p>
<p>Either  way, as the girls filed out, each thanking him with a hug which was  mostly sisterly, but no less sincere or firm, he couldn’t help feel  a little sense of regret; a little tug at his stomach, telling him, <em>You should be with them. </em></p>
<p>Maybe  that was the case.</p>
<p>Or maybe  he needed to let go. Chiharu might also have told him that.</p>
<p>He  decided that maybe that was what he needed—to have Chiharu tell him  to let go. As he paid the bill, (his final act of chivalry towards  those girls, at least in this matter) he dug in his pocket for his  phone. As he dialed Chiharu’s number, he decided that was exactly  what he needed.</p>
<p>She gave  him that, and more.</p>
