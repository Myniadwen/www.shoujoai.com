<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Japanese  has two syllabic alphabets in addition to Kanji (which is not a syllabic alphabet): hiragana and  katakana. Katakana is used to spell out loanwords, typically—words  borrowed from another language. Normally if you saw the words <em>Velvet Rose </em>written in Japan it would be in katakana.</span></p>

Rei had  rather been hoping that the mode of the day would once again be  card-playing, but alas, it was futile—less than halfway into their  first round of Napoleon, Yoshino declared that even hung over,  Sachiko was an invincible opponent, so she would take a nap instead.  Others dropped out rather quickly after that, and while it was  disappointing, Rei couldn’t rightly blame them—trying to take on  a brick wall like Sachiko while battling a hangover seemed to her a  prospect about as pleasant as a pap smear.  Even Sachiko did not seem  displeased with this prospect, and soon enough, leaned her head back  and began to sleep.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact,  within thirty of leaving the hotel, the only three people still awake  in the car were Rei, Sei, and Yumi, who quickly decided to  consolidate and fend off boredom.  Rei was personally surprised that  Yumi wasn’t asleep herself—she seemed as hung over as the rest of  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei, on  the other hand, was not surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  they had clustered around the driver’s seat (they had to relocate  Shimako to the back, which was less of a problem than they had  anticipated) the first thing Sei asked was, “Are you feeling  better, Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still have a hangover,” Yumi mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  pull off soon enough for some breakfast, and I’ll order you a  prairie oyster,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei gave  her a look of disbelief. “You’re not serious. Those things are  terrible, and they don’t work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell they don’t,” Sei said. “You just have to make them right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it?” Yumi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pray  you never find out,” Rei said firmly. “I think it makes you feel  worse than the hangover.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  seems hard to believe,” Yumi grumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw,  come on,” Sei chided. “Where’s my perky Yumi and her  adventurous spirit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think she’s sleeping off a hangover,” Rei pointed out.  “She’ll be sleeping off a stomachache too, if you feed her one of  those.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m already sleeping off a stomachache,” Yumi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See? What harm can it do?” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you actually tasted one before?” Rei asked. “It seems to  me as though you wouldn’t be asking that question if you had.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re just a cynic,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi thought, very privately, that they were both just noisy.  She  and sound were still not quite on speaking terms.  She wouldn’t say  such a thing, of course—if nothing else, the shame it would cause  Sachiko might<br />
      <em>you didn’t change into your own pajamas</em><br />
  Yumi sank a little lower in her seat, feeling heat creep up her face.   Rei noticed, as did Sei, but a look from the latter silenced the  former before she could say anything. Instead, Sei just put her hand  on Yumi’s head and gave her a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cheer up, Yumi,” she said. “You’ll feel better as soon as…”  they passed a road sign which informed them that food was five kilometers  away.  “Five kilometers elapses, apparently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  a little afraid,” Yumi murmured.  At the time, she wasn’t sure  what she was referring to, though Sei had a pretty good idea, and Rei  was starting to develop her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  to be afraid of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  driving with only one hand,” Rei said. “That’s something to be  afraid of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei  driving with both hands is something to be afraid of.” Yumi said,  and laughed, in spite of herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  huffed in mock indignation and put her other hand back on the wheel.  “I feel as though I’m being unfairly persecuted,” she said. “I  am <em>not </em>that bad of a driver.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are if I’m not sugarcoating my words,” Rei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really? I’d love to see what it sounds like when you are,” Sei  said, and then dropped her voice low in a halfway decent imitation of  Rei’s. “Um, excuse me for being rude, but you’re not really a  fan of driving, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  snickered.  “My voice doesn’t sound like that, but I’ll give  you credit for trying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  voice sounds exactly like that,” Sei said, not yielding an inch.  “Doesn’t it, Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Yumi  wasn’t paying attention anymore. They had been driving through a  section of road enclosed entirely by pine trees, but as Sei spoke,  they rounded a curve and the lake came into view again. The sun was  at their backs, and all at once, it looked as though the water was  not really water, but rather a million sparkling diamonds, rocking  back and forth gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though a  logical person might have said that it was all just water, Yumi  suddenly felt as though maybe she understood the difference between a  lake and the ocean. Certainly the ocean was beautiful, vast and  clear, seeming to stretch out to infinity, but the lake held a  certain <em>something </em>that an ocean could not touch; something to  do with its <em>closeness. </em>The way the water reflected the light  onto the trees behind it, causing the forest to appear as though it  had come to life, moving with the sway of the water; the look of the  short beach on one side, flanked by trees, and the way it made the  lake fit in like just another piece of nature, instead of some giant,  independent entity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  could grasp perhaps half of these thoughts coherently in her present  state, and so the best she could muster in appreciation of the beauty  which overwhelmed her all at once was a deep sigh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A sigh,  and, in spite of the confusion that the previous night had brought  her, a single thought:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  someday I can come here with just </em>Onee-sama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  it turned out, Sachiko, who had awoken only a few moments before, had  precisely the same thought as she sleepily glanced out the window,  and one more, though it was more of a vague idea than a coherent  thought.  She thought that maybe, just maybe, it would be nice if she  could share this scene with somebody, somewhere, so that they could  feel the same sense of peace that she felt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Peace,  however, was on nobody’s plate that day.</span></p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  restaurant was called <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Velvet Rose, </span></em>written not in katakana but  in roman letters,and it was apparently a rockin’ joint. As  Sei parked the van and Rei roused the group from their groggy  slumber, they heard a dull thumping. Nobody paid it any mind until  they opened the door and heard the thumping more clearly, accompanied  by a crunchy noise which, while only recognized by Yoshino and Sei as  a distorted guitar, was very obviously musical in one way or another.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s…”  Yoshino blinked. “Rock music.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  glanced at her watch. “But it’s not even noon yet,” she said.  Apparently, rock music was very much like alcohol in that there was a  time of day before which playing it was considered unsavory. Had this  been commented on to Sei, she might have remarked that rock music was  like alcohol in many ways, not the least of which being that it could  serve as a remarkably strong incentive for attractive women to take  their shirts off in public.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  at least we know the joint is going to have prairie oysters,” Sei  said.  “Maybe even on tap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  snickered. Rei looked as though she disapproved, but in reality, she  couldn’t help but agree.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  was not sure how to react to this. On the one hand, she found  immediately that she didn’t mind the crunchy, rhythmic sounds of a  genre of music which she had always been informed promoted only loose  morals and looser talents. On the other hand…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On  the other hand,” Sachiko said, “I believe that all of us may just  die if that music is as loud as it seems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Prairie  oysters on tap,” Sei said again. “I’m telling you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  inside of the building wasn’t really abnormal. It was empty save  for a solitary man behind the counter of a long bar towards the back,  which Sachiko also did not find to be abnormal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the  music was louder inside. Oh, how it was louder. The one saving grace  was that it was coming from a jukebox in the corner, which meant that  it was likely that after the song ended, there would be no more  unless the waiter slash barkeep got free songs off of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As they  entered, the man nodded and gave an obligatory “welcome!” but did  not move to seat them. He felt that the <em>please seat yourself </em>sign  towards the front justified this, as did the music, one of Mongolian  Chop Squad’s best; he did not feel like moving until it was over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rather  than lingering near the door, absentmindedly considering where they  ought to sit until one of them made an arbitrary decision, all of  them immediately went to the bar and sat. A bit annoyed, as it meant  he would be distracted from Ryuuske’s astronomical guitar solo, the  man, whose name was also Ryuuske, approached the bar from his side  and said, “What’ll you have? Do you need a menu?” to the  group—all women, which he did not mind, but most nonplussed by the  music, which he did—as a whole, rather than any one of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of  them spoke up, a tall drink of water with sandy blonde hair and tits  that demanded his attention (though he refused to give it—working  at a joint like this, just far off of Kyoto to attract the  disenfranchised Kyoto rock underground, you got a lot of women with  tits out to here, and you got used to it…sort of) said, “We’ll  have…” she took a second, probably counting, “six prairie  oysters if you’ve got ‘em.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  one, an even taller drink of water who probably could have passed for  a pretty boy if she’d had a mind to, said, “Hey, <em>I </em>don’t  have a hangover.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  first woman said, “No, but if we’re all going to do it, we’re<em>all </em>going to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  blinked in astonishment. He knew what she was talking about—it was  a local folk remedy for hangovers—but he had never been asked to<em>make </em>one. He wasn’t even sure if he should—after all,  serving raw eggs was a liability issue. “Are you serious?” he  asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Completely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  occurred to him that if they were ordering a hangover remedy (which,  he believed, was nothing but a crock of shit) that they probably had  hangovers, and that he should probably turn the music on the juke  down—<em>son of a bitch, I missed the solo—</em>before it killed  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  a minute,” he said. He was the owner of the joint, so he couldn’t  exactly excuse himself to <em>ask a manager, </em>but at the very least  he could take a moment of congress with himself. He went into the  back, and, for some reason that he could not understand, opened the  giant walk-in cooler and checked his egg stock. It was, of course,  full—this had been a slow morning on a day that was usually packed  for breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  a load of shit, but if they think it’ll help, then why not? If  it’ll make them feel better, if only as a placebo, there’s no  reason why not, is there? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well,  except for e-coli. That’s a decent reason why not.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Come  on. When was the last time </em>anybody <em>got sick off eating raw  egg? There are like, twenty cases a year in Japan due to raw eggs. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  just think how your fine establishment would benefit from being party  to one of them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Aw,  fuck it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was nobody else in the restaurant, and, in the end, he was bored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides,  that sandy-blonde girl was pretty attractive. And—he glanced out  the door to the kitchen and took a good, long look at a tall,  classy-looking girl with dark hair speaking quietly with a short,  brown-haired girl—that tall one was a fucking <em>knockout. </em>The  rest of them were cute—the girl with the braids, in particular,  looked like she had some hot sauce in her, just by the way she spoke  with the boyish girl, and besides, it looked like she was absently  tapping her finger to Chiba’s staccato voice—but this girl looked  like she had some honest class to her, even through the only thinly  applied makeup and the wrinkled clothes.  She looked like she didn’t  belong here, and something about that was attractive to Ryuuske.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So why  not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  minutes later, he had turned the music on the speakers down, and he  had a fresh carton of eggs on the bar, a glass in front of each girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  how’ll you take ‘em?” he asked. “You want the tail of the dog  that bit you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  thanks,” the sandy-blonde said. “We’re driving today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  yeah?” he said as he began cracking eggs into glasses, forcing  himself to relax after he broke the yolk of the first one and had to  replace it. “Where to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kyoto,”  the classy girl said, and his heart nearly fell out of his ass. Her  voice, though ragged from a night of what could only have been heavy  drinking, was still smooth as butter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  anything in particular?”  Even though he understood that he had  about as good of a shot at this girl as the egg he was cracking into  her glass, he found himself silently hoping she didn’t say,<em>visiting my boyfriend.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know,” she said a little thoughtfully, “to be honest, I’m not  certain. Sei, what <em>are </em>we going there for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  farther away from Kashiwagi than Tokyo is,” Sei, the sandy-blonde,  apparently <em>Sei,</em> said, immediately, as though she had rehearsed  it. “And it’s pretty there, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  made Ryuuske smile. It looked like Sei had some hot sauce to her too.  Maybe they made ‘em different down in Tokyo. Maybe he should find  out some time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if you’re headed down there, try and catch a show at Taku Taku.  It’s got a lot of big-name crap there, but on weeknights you can  still catch some up-and-comers if you’re lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Taku  Taku?” the classy<br />
      <em>oh  god I think I might be melting</em><br />
  one  asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a live house down in Kyoto. A lot of big bands hop through there, but  a lot of really good underground bands do too, so it’s an  interesting place.” Ryuuske thought that he had indeed chosen the  right profession—to service a restaurant, one needed to be able to  keep his cool even when speaking to somebody who made you want to  stutter just to be thought of as <em>cute. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow,  though, he couldn’t quite envision this<br />
      <em>lady</em><br />
  woman  in a live house.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  live house, huh,” Sei said. “You know, to be honest, I think it  might kill you, Sachiko.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sachiko.  That’s her name. </em><em>I wonder how it’s written.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  you been to one?” Sachiko replied, a touch contritely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei gave  a small grin. “You know, they’re not very ladylike,” she  replied, evading the question. “They’re all smoky, and half of  the people are drinking and the other half are sweating it off. And a  lot of the time, the music is so loud you can’t hear yourself  think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  chewed on this for a moment, and then said, “I think that if it’s  possible to get into one, it would be an interesting experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want…” Ryuuske pitched in, a little hopeful, “I could help  you get in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Sachiko said, and Ryuuske thought privately that he would like to get  her in a room by herself and change the inflection on that <em>oh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  he said. “I get a lot of folks from Taku  Taku in here, so if I  write you a note and sign it, they’ll probably jump you to the head  of the line if there is one. I mean, if there’s not it’s no big  deal, you just buy a ticket, but…” For some reason—<em>no, not</em>some reason<em>, a very specific reason—</em>Ryuuske just wanted  these girls to remember his name. Even if it meant calling in a favor  or two.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  no,” Sachiko began, “we couldn’t ask you to—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  most certainly could,” Yoshino cut in, an excited look on her face.  “And we’ll thank you for it graciously, won’t we?” She gave  Sei a prompting look which she did not need.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  most certainly will,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh.”  Sachiko said, taken aback. “I suppose we will, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ryuuske  smiled and then grabbed a sheet off of his order booklet.  “So how  do you write your name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What he  did not see at this was the shorter girl with pigtails give him a  queer glance, something mixed between concern and an almost animal  territorialism.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The<em>Sachi </em>is from luck, and the <em>ko </em>is from child,”  Sachiko said. “Do you need my last name as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  couldn’t hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The look  given to him by this pigtailed girl was now leaning more towards the  territorial side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ogasawara.  Small umbrella field,” she said this one more quickly, as though  she was trying to brush over it. It took him only a moment to figure  out why—the Ogasawara Group was, after all, the company that had  loaned him this land and had sold him most of his tables. He kept it  to himself, though, and acted as though he didn’t recognize the  name. It was obvious, after all, that she didn’t want him to, and  he understood something of not wanting to be associated with one’s  family, for whatever reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  next few minutes, as he wrote their note out and they all counted to  three and downed their prairie oysters in unison, laughed, and then  sat through a spell in which the pigtailed girl rubbed Sachiko’s  back as she struggled to keep hers down (something that Ryuuske might  have told them might happen) while the tomboyish one slowly mopped  her brow with cool water, he thought privately that maybe she had  done better with distancing herself from her family than he had—after  all, she seemed to have a whole family sitting right here in front of  him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well,  but that’s not true and you know it. Chiharu and Tomitake and the  rest of them would come and drink with me even if they had to do it  in my basement. Maybe it’s because I’m a male, or maybe it’s  because of Chiharu and I, whenever we </em>are <em>Chiharu and I, but  maybe I don’t always associate it with family like that. Maybe just  because we don’t act like that. Maybe it’s just a matter of being  grown up, and having to pick myself up when I fall to pieces. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  that’s what being grown up is, I’d rather skip. How many times  have Chiharu and Tomitake dragged you out of here at three in the  morning?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  that’s why I noticed Sachiko. Sure, she oozes class like Chiharu  does when she tries to, but she acts like Chiharu did before she got  into trouble with booze. Like maybe she’s just a little invincible.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck  it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what’ll you girls have today?” he asked. They were his only  customers, and besides…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>he</em>might have appreciated a nice gesture on a hard hangover,  especially after being force-fed (via peer pressure) something as  disgusting as a prairie oyster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Prairie oysters are on the house.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sachiko  had not noticed the territorial look that Yumi had given Ryuuske, who  she thought was a very nice man, but she did notice something very  nice as they dug into their food: Yumi was sitting next to her, and  had scooted her seat just a little bit closer. That damp mist of  awkwardness still hung over them, but it was weaker here, as though  they had emerged from a dank jungle onto an open plain, the scent of  where they had been still lingering but the feel of the fresh air  driving it away even as they spoke.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>,  are you sure you’ll be all right to go do something as strenuous as  seeing live music tonight?” Yumi asked, and then spooned some egg  onto a piece of toast and took a bite.  How she was able to eat a  fried egg was beyond Sachiko. “It’s very…noisy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  kind of the idea,” Yoshino said. “If your music was quiet  nobody’d hear it and everybody would go home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  I mean…doesn’t your head hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  didn’t know if it was the prairie oyster (it seemed unlikely) or  the food, or maybe just the pleasant conversation, but now that she  thought about it, it did not hurt so bad as it had before. A little  advil, and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>god  damn it wheres my advil<br />
  sachiko  would you just calm down and talk to me<br />
  no my  head hurts just go away</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  gave her head a sharp jerk. There was no reason to start thinking  about that now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Especially  not after she had just done<br />
      <em>that</em><br />
  with  Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What</em>did <em>we do? </em>she asked herself. Surprisingly enough, <em>herself</em>answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Do I  need to draw you a picture? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Did  we have sex?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  or if you did, you were so drunk that I don’t think it can count. I  think you might have if you had been a little more sober.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…Why?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  what?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  did we almost have sex?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  felt almost awkward thinking this. As though if she had spoken it  aloud to anybody, whether or not she knew them, she might feel a bit  stupid just after.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, it’s not that bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  smiled. “That’s good. We really did overdo it las…” she  trailed off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei gave  her a look out of the corner of her eye, and Yumi did her best to  shrink back into her stool.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  had no idea what was going on, though she had a few guesses, but she  did feel the air of awkwardness begin to descend over this, and so  said, “Does anybody else have any ideas of what to do in Kyoto?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  would very much like to see the temples,” Shimako said, her voice a  little raspier than usual. (What they did not see when she spoke was  Ryuuske slumping just a little in his seat as he drank coffee, giving  their obligatory ten minutes before he checked on them.  Sachiko  might have acted like Chiharu, but god damn if this girl did not  sound exactly like Chiharu did after a long night of rum and sex.  What a bunch of girls were these, who had wandered into his store on  this quiet morning.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course you would,” Sei said. “If nobody else wants to be bored  out of their blasphemous boots, I’ll even escort you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  a Catholic as well,” Shimako reminded her. Sei braced herself for  the inevitable stinging follow up, but it didn’t come. Perhaps  Shimako couldn’t think of one. Perhaps she didn’t care enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  maybe she’s not in the mood to banter with you. Could you blame  her?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  know it’s a little too late to be realizing this, but I probably  should not have said that to her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  what the fuck was I supposed to say? </em>No, it was great, let’s do  it again whenever<em> would be nice, but that would be a damned lie  and we’d both know it. Shit on that. Shit on that big time. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  kind of like to see them,” Yumi said. “I think it would be  interesting. In spite of what our teachers say, I’m kind of  interested in other religions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Straight  to hell with her,” Yoshino said. “And don’t forget your bathing  suit, you could get yourself a tan for once.” She cracked a grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will  you come with us?” Yumi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Yoshino said. “The view from the top of some of those  temples is amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  could all just pick a tall temple to hike up to and have a lunch,”  Rei suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  and you can bring your whistle and stopwatch and give us lashings if  we climb slowly,” Yoshino said, and the group laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>,”  Yumi asked, “is there anything you’d like to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Again,  she brings me into the conversation before I even realize that I’ve  excluded myself, </em>Sachiko thought. <em>Without her I would be an  ornament. Without her, everything I did would be akin to a family  function.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…”  Sachiko thought for a moment, but it only took her that moment to  think of something she rather would like to do. “I’d like to see  a castle, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surveying  your domain,” Sei jabbed, and Rei and Yoshino chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,”  was all that Sachiko said.  For some reason, though, this comment  hurt her more than it ought to have, which was not at all. She  wondered if Yumi noticed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As they  all turned back to their meals, Yumi touched Sachiko’s shoulder  gently and murmured, “She was just joking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  very nearly cried. Nobody noticed but Yumi.</span></p>

This was  the dynamic of the group which had wandered into his establishment as  Ryuuske observed it—as a part bartender, part restaurateur, he was,  whether by practice or by talent, very astute at recognizing dynamics  of groups, though this was only useful in the former function:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei and  the girl whose voice could have made pornography in its present  condition were acquaintances, but he had noticed several times this  latter girl looking at Sei for confirmation or unspoken advice—<em>this  is a good idea, isn’t it. Isn’t it? Isn’t it. </em>Sei seemed to  have some affection for her, but she held it back for some reason. He  had counted no less than four separate instances of Sei moving to pat  this girl’s head, only to stop halfway through. Additionally, he  had noticed this girl would sometimes avoid eye contact with Sei—not  uncommon among the Japanese, something he had noticed acutely after  going to America and having people ram their gaze down his throat for  six months, and then coming back to Japan, in which eye contact  wasn’t always considered terribly polite. What was strange was the  way it would happen—Sei would crack a joke, or perhaps this girl  (who was amazing at jabs) would knock at Sei a bit, and then they  would take a glance at one another, obligatory among friends who  joked quite a bit to make sure nothing had gone too far, but the  glance would only be for a moment, and then they would break their  gazes, almost simultaneously. It was almost as though they were  friends who had dated at one point not so terribly recently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tall  drink of water and the French-braided girl who liked Chiba were  friendly as hell. Touch between them was almost constant, be it a  small pat on the arm or a touch of the hands. He had heard them say  that they were Catholic, and if it were not for this, he would have  sworn with his hand on whatever holy text was available that they  were lovers in private and associates in public. It may yet have been  the case. Additionally, the French-braid seemed to be Sei’s  accomplice in many jokes, and a close friend of the pigtailed girl,  as the two of them would occasionally end their sentences with some  obscure reference to something he had never heard of and then crack  up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  this pigtailed girl that interested him the most, though, because of  her relationship to Sachiko. Things between them seemed to be in the<em>weird </em>state that followed many different sorts of events, but  most notably a night of misplaced sex between friends. They avoided  looking at each other altogether save for in sidelong glances, and  conversations between the two of them which had nothing wrong with  them were often cut short midway with a short, awkward <em>cool </em>or<em>interesting. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  could not help being concerned about Sachiko. Misplaced sex was a  huge problem between friends. Lord knew it had not helped him and  Chiharu the first time around. He could do precisely nothing about  it, he knew, but even so…he wished suddenly that it was night and  he was operating a bar instead of a restaurant, so that he could dish  out his own advice to her. Not for her sake, of course—advice was  the easiest thing in the world to give, and consequently the  stupidest thing in the world to take—but for his. Because he was  concerned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Concerned.  Funky word for it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  he struck up a conversation with Sei and the French-braid (whose name  turned out to be Yoshino) about music.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  noticed you grooving to Chiba,” he said to Yoshino as he gave her a  cup of coffee and took her plate. “You a Beck fan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  nodded. “They’re pretty good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  from a girl who likes to listen to choir music, you should be  amazed,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ryuuske  laughed. “Oh yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think it’s a prerequisite for going to a Catholic school,” Sei  said. “You have to like gospel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Absolutely.  Sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ryuuske  laughed, and then took Sei’s plate as well and said, “I’ll be  right back.” He brought the small load of dishes into the back,  rinsed them off quickly—it didn’t take much, since the girls  seemed to be remarkably neat people—and dropped them into his  dishwasher.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When he  got back out, Sachiko was fishing through her purse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ah,  damn it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  much do I owe you, sir?” she asked, and for a moment, their eyes  met. He flashed her a charming smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  like to say <em>nothing, </em>but I don’t think I could afford it.  Your hangover cures are on the house, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t have to do that,” she said, and he held his grin. “But  thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  began fishing around in her purse as well, but as she opened her  mouth to stop Sachiko, presumably, from picking up the entire tab,  Sei took her arm and said, “Now, why would you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no reason for Sachiko to pay the entire bill,” Rei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Except  for that successful conglomerate with her name on it,” Sei said.  “Besides, while none of you were looking, I paid the hotel tab, so  it’s even.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Normally,  Sachiko might have been bothered by this. The mention of the  Ogasawara group; the connection between it and her; the use of it to  separate her in some way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time, it seemed…okay. Because Sei was being funny, in part, but for  some other reason, as well. Maybe because Sei picked up the hotel  tab. Or maybe…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  paid the bill in cash, and after thanking Ryuuske, they left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei was  too devious for that. She had seen the look that Ryuuske was giving  her, and on top of that, she had seen the look that Yumi was giving  Ryuuske.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  too perfect. And Sachiko had left the restaurant in a considerably  better mood for it, even if she probably would never catch onto why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  thought that in spite of the remnants of a headache and the sleepy  faces all around, it might be a very good day.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A black<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">hot-shit </span></em>car pulled into <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Velvet Rose </span></em>three hours after  Sachiko and her group had left. Ryuuske had not forgotten them, but  he had put them in the back of his head as the stored filled up with  a lunch rush large enough to make up for the failed breakfast hour.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  spotted the <em>hot-shit </em>car and frowned. Out of it stepped two  black-suited <em>hot-shit </em>toughs and one beige-suited youth, about  Sachiko’s age, who didn’t look quite like he belonged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked in and stepped up to the counter immediately. He did his best  not to look like he noticed their effort to look like<em> hot-shits. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse  me,” the youth said. “I hate to bother you, but did a group of  six girls about my age pass through here this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking  back on it, Ryuuske could see no reason not to tell the truth, but he  did not. “Dunno. Maybe. It was a pretty busy breakfast hour, I  didn’t have a lot of time to tally faces.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see,” he said. “Well, if you do happen to see them, please give  me a call.” From the inside of his jacket, he produced a piece of  paper. Pictures of each of the six girls from this morning.  Underneath, a phone number.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  turned to leave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,”  Ryuuske called. “Who’s asking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  considered for a moment. “Suguru Kashiwagi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(It’s  farther away from Kashiwagi than Tokyo is)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ryuuske  nodded. “You got it, buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” the man smiled politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suguru  leaned into his seat as the car started in motion again. “He was  lying,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” the man to his left, whose name was Wantabe, said. Wantabe  was a close friend of Suguru’s. “It was coming out of his pores.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suguru  shrugged. “I suppose I can’t blame him. I would have done the  same if Sachiko came in and asked me to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  think she asked him to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  She’s not that kind of a person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wantabe  nodded. “You know, you could probably just let her come back on her  own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. I probably will. But I need to talk to her first.” Even as it  came out of his mouth, Suguru didn’t like the way it sounded. He  hoped it didn’t sound that way when he said it to her.</span></p>
