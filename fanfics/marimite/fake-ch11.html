<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  Notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  chapter gets a little religious. It is, after all, about a Catholic  school. I take a few stances that I think that the characters in  Marimite, given the heavy yuri subtext of the whole thing and the  seeming lack of fundamentalism in the series as a whole, wouldn’t  have trouble taking. </span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In other  news, you might notice a disproportionate amount of references to  alcohol in this chapter. Just so’s we’re clear, this fic takes  place the summer after Sachiko graduates. Sei is 20, but the rest of  them are underage.  However, alcohol is very easy to obtain in Japan,  being available from simple street vending machines, which is why the  brief bit about legality on Sachiko’s part is supposed to be silly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  should know better by now.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"> God Makes  the Rain</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As Rei  led her towards the small café just off of the main lobby with  a loud, honest promise to hurry back, Sachiko thought numbly that  usually when two people <em>ought to have a talk, </em>it was usually  conducted discreetly.  She couldn’t come up with any concrete  reasoning for this, of course; in fact, if prompted, she might have  found that she could not come up with much of anything just then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sat  her down at a small table and told her to stay put. Sachiko, her mind  still in the midst of such a haze that those who did not know her  might have called her melodramatic, needed no telling.  Rei left, and  returned about two minutes later with a pair of steaming cups. She  put one down in front of Sachiko, who looked down and found not tea,  as she had expected, but coffee. Sachiko did not ordinarily drink  coffee. It stained one’s teeth, and it was bitter.  She drank tea.  All ladies drank tea.<br />
      <em>(all  ladies don’t look at their </em>petite soeur’s)<br />
  This  coffee was black, too.  No cream, no sugar. It would be bitter. She  would probably pull a face.  A most unladylike<br />
  <em>(glance)<br />
    (posterior)</em><br />
  face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  Rei said as she sat down across from Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  only looked back at her.<br />
      <em>(The  least you can do is get ahold of yourself you stupid girl)<br />
        (get  yourself under control or you will embarrass me)<br />
        (us)<br />
        (ALL  OF US GET YOURSELF</em><em> UNDER CONTROL)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  shook her head sharply. It was a move Rei knew well, and in an  instant her face became full of concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>More </em>concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” Sachiko said. “I seem to have drifted into a daze for a  moment. I apologize for my rudeness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned. Rei didn’t like Sachiko’s tone one bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  being polite. To me. In what is, essentially, private. </em>She looked  around, and indeed, the only person even in earshot was the barista  from whom she had gotten her coffee, a short, solid woman who was  presently paging through a magazine disinterestedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  isn’t right. Not at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko,”  Rei said. “Stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop?”  Sachiko looked genuinely confused. “Have I done something to offend  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn  it to Hell.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  might have understood immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  Rei, who had since her entrance into the Yamayurikai been fairly  close with Sachiko, a good half minute, and this was not because Rei  did not know Sachiko well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn  it to Hell, </em>in her mind, turned into something far more vulgar.  It was possible that Sachiko genuinely was not following her, but it  was more likely—and frustrating—that she was simply doing as she  had always been taught.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  truth, Rei thought, was that Sachiko was simply an extraordinarily  good actress, because she didn’t truly believe herself to be acting  at all. Some small, untraceable part of Sachiko Ogasawara believed  that she was, in fact, under close watch by some obscure Forces of  Those Wealthier than She at all times, and that any slight mistake  might embarrass and possibly ruin the family entirely. That was the  crux of the matter as Rei knew it, after long, hard thought over the  course of many nights about midway through her first year. Some  people might have thought it unbelievably selfish of Sachiko to  require (even unaware) such deep, concentrated thought and effort in  order to keep her stable and human sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  would have laughed at that accusation. Rei would have said that  anybody who thought that didn’t understand what friendship was, not  even a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  would have been right, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nobody  could do anything about the way Sachiko was, though. Getting the girl  to lighten up was nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Except  for Yumi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah.  Except for Yumi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  that Yumi couldn’t often bring herself to do, though, was play the  game she needed to play by simply stepping around Sachiko and her  manners.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was  something Rei was very good at. She knew Sei was talented in this  area as well, but her methods were too crass for Rei to even attempt  to imitate. It worked, but there were limits to how far outside of  her boundaries Rei wanted to go unless absolutely necessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Rei said. “Not at all. So then, let’s talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Sachiko said pleasantly. “Was there something you needed to speak  to me about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  found herself a little frustrated at this; polite, she could take  patiently. Seeming memory loss, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And so,  she found herself thinking of Sei, of all people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Rei said. “I need to talk to you about how you’ve been staring at  Yumi’s” <em>ass</em>—<em>no, you’ll lose her </em>“butt for the  past ten minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked again and froze up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  sighed and put her hand over Sachiko’s, moved it to the cup of  coffee. “Drink it,” she said. “It’ll help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  terribly sorry,” Sachiko said nearly automatically. “I don’t do  well with coffee. My stomach sometimes becomes upset when I—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drink,”  Rei said more firmly.  She suddenly wished she had something stronger  to lace it with, but according to Sei, all of the good booze was in  the trunk.  (She had spoken very briefly with an uncharacteristically  distracted Sei about this beforehand, and that was the only thing she  had gotten from it. She wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it.)  “Your teeth will be fine. You’ve eaten properly today, so your  stomach will be, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked again. Slowly, she touched the cup, and then her fingers  curled around it almost reflexively. A moment later she brought it to  her lips and sipped, recoiled almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hot?”  Rei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  I’m sorry.”  Sachiko said. For a second, she felt as though she  might simply shriek. Instead, she looked down. “Oh dear. I seem to  have…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spilled.  You got coffee on your brand new swimsuit.” She finished Sachiko’s  sentence so that Sachiko wouldn’t.  “You’ll have to go out into  the rain and clean yourself up, but not before we talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About  Yumi’s…” Sachiko trailed off. The shock seemed to have done her  good, and Rei was glad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  looked at her with a patient, kind smile, and Sachiko couldn’t help  but smile back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A second  later, it came spilling out of her mouth.  It was a surprisingly  brief tale, told with an objectivity which pervaded it from her  description of how fast she normally changed right down to how she  felt that little hit she felt in her gut when she saw the smooth line  of Yumi’s backside.  The objectivity made it almost frightening,  but Rei understood. Sachiko normally had two reactions to things  which genuinely frightened her: She avoided them, or she took the hit  front-on.  When they had gone to Hanadera to participate in the  festival, she had done the latter, at Yumi’s behest, and she had  treated it as objectively as she could, though it had not ended that  way. At Yumi’s behest, she did a lot of things. She dropped her  objectivity at Yumi’s behest, without Yumi even asking for it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t understand,” Sachiko said quietly. “I don’t understand  it at all.  I mean…” She shook her head and tried another sip of  coffee. She didn’t spill any this time, though this certainly did  not mean that it was not hot enough to burn her; it just meant that  she was more under her own control, and less under the control of  whatever she usually kept herself subdued with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  felt all this,” Rei said, “and you fought off the urge to look  back. Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  it’s wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  stared at Rei openly, mouth agape.  “<em>What</em>’s wrong? <em>That! </em>It’s…” Rei would later add <em>at the risk of sounding like  a walking cliché </em>to her memory of that incident, “a  sin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  said, “It’s not a sin to love your <em>petite soeur. </em>That’s  the goal of the whole system, to foster a bond so strong that it  defies all convention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Nothing </em>should defy convention,” Sachiko said so quickly that she  probably hadn’t even thought about it. Rei ignored it and pressed  on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Listen,”  she said. “You and Yumi are…very close.  Yumi is probably the  only person in this universe short of God himself who can get past  your defenses when you’ve got them up strong. I know that and I  accept it, and I’m not ashamed by it. For you to feel a powerful  love for that one person is…so normal that it’s strange to <em>me </em>that you haven’t noticed it until now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that sort of love shouldn’t have anything to do with—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  smiled the genuine smile of a friend who feels like it’s maybe all  she can do, and put her hand back on Sachiko’s.  “Nobody wise  ever put the words <em>love </em>and <em>should </em>in the same  sentence, Sachiko.  Love, no matter what the hard-liners say, is  never a sin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never  isn’t a good word either,” Sachiko said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  you’re right. It’s not. But…I don’t think that love is a sin.  Acting on love can be sinful in the same way that acting on hate can  be sinful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  felt something hit her hard. “So that means that I shouldn’t…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  said that, not me,” Rei said. “I think you should love who you  want without fear of sin, because I think sin is fundamentally  hurtful to somebody, and that doesn’t seem to me to be what  you’re…” She trailed off. “Do you understand what I mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  nodded slowly. “I think I do. I don’t know if I agree, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  because you were raised by strict parents.” Rei smiled at her. “And  you didn’t live next door to Yoshino. It doesn’t matter, though.  You weren’t looking for a valid biblical justification for wanting  to stare at Yumi anyway, were you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  slowly shook her head, and silently wondered at how mature Rei seemed  at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose I’m just…” Sachiko said, not sure what she was  precisely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know you are,” Rei said with a smile. “It’s confusing, you  know? And it’s harder since you are...who you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  almost said, </em>since I'm engaged to Suguru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess all I can really tell you to do is to take your time. There’s  no other way you can think straight about these kinds of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko thought, <em>She  talks about these things as if from experience, </em>and wondered for  the first time with a little jilt how similarly Sei Satou would reply  if Sachiko were to confide in her about Yumi’s posterior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Sachiko said with a genuine smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,”  Rei said. “Thank <em>you</em>. I feel myself as though I understand  things better now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  could not help but wonder what exactly she understood better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe if  she would have known, things would have been easier for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Probably  it was best, then, that she didn’t.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you think was wrong with Sachiko?” Yoshino asked Yumi as they  clustered around the exit, all holding towels and staring at the rain  outside, gathering their nerve and trying to find a nonalcoholic  solution to their increasingly problematic common sense.  “I didn’t  notice anything, but <em>Onee-sama </em>seemed pretty concerned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  did?” Yumi asked, genuinely surprised. To her, Rei had seemed  roughly the same as she always had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  You probably couldn’t see it, since she doesn’t mother you around  all the time, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen Rei that  concerned about somebody.  Probably not since my operation, you  know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really…”  Yumi frowned. <em>Was something that I couldn’t see really wrong  with </em>Onee-sama<em>? How did I miss it that easily?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably  because you were too caught up in thinking about how nice your </em>Onee-sama <em>looks in that swimsuit you picked out for her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  neck flushed red at this and she shook her head furiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yohsino  laughed delightedly. “You look exactly like Shimako!” she  whispered, and at this, Yumi only flushed redder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking  of Shimako, though,” Yumi said quickly, trying to get the subject  off of swimsuits, Sachiko, or any combination of the two.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  was immediately serious again. “Mm. She didn’t even hear me. I  think she’s off in her own world right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  never like that, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  glanced over at the short, beautiful girl and found her, as Yoshino  said, standing—nearly leaning; something unheard of for somebody as  upright and proper as Shimako Toudo—staring at the mysterious space  halfway between eye level and the floor, the realm which only those  utterly lost in thought ever seemed to be able to see clearly. She  raised a single petite finger and touched her lower lip, held it  there for a moment, and then lowered it, not moving her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A hand  on both of their shoulders made them jump and very nearly screech.  When they turned around—neither slowly nor quietly—they saw Sei  standing behind them, not grinning as she normally might have been.  Rather, her face was fairly serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  want to leave Shimako alone about that for a while,” she said  quietly, her voice uncharacteristically raspy. “When we go outside,  talk about anything else, okay?” She attempted a half-hearted  smile, made it about three-quarters of the way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  looked at Sei for a moment, but before she could say anything,  Yoshino said, “All right. I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  smiled. “Tonight ought to be interesting, I think, if that’s the  case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  hadn’t the slightest idea what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  looked a little darker after that.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei and  Sachiko came back a few minutes after that, carrying their towels.  This surprised Yumi—they had been wearing their towels as they  walked out, out of a sheer sense of modesty that only Sei seemed to  have no trouble overcoming.  Yumi, Yoshino, and Shimako were still  wearing them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  first thing that Yumi thought was, <em>she really does look good in  that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  first thing that Sachiko thought was almost exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  did you go?” Yoshino asked. Rei shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What Rei  vocalized was: “We had a cup of coffee,” What Rei said was: <em>I’ll  tell you when I’m ready.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  immediately walked to Sachiko’s side, as quickly as she could.  Immediately, the latter girl felt a matched set of tugs at her: One  told her to move away, as quickly as she could, to look away and tell  everybody that she felt ill and tell Yumi to go with the others and <em>flee, flee as fast as you can before you do something that would  shame you in front of everybody.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other told her to move towards Yumi, and maybe to do something that  might shame her in front of everybody.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt  comfortable meeting the two tugs halfway, and standing still until  Yumi reached her, and then smiling at her <em>petite soeur, </em>who  took Sachiko’s hand as soon as she was in reach and gave her a look  which went far beyond the scope of ordinary concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you all right, <em>Onee-sama?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course I am!” Sachiko said immediately, a smile which surprised her  coming to her face. “Yumi, please don’t be ridiculous. Rei simply  wanted to treat me to a cup of coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  blinked. “<em>Onee-sama, </em>you don’t drink coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For some  reason, this simple knowledge caused a very faint flutter of  Sachiko’s stomach. <em>Didn’t it take me twice that time, back in  the café, to remember that myself?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  does now,” Rei said with a little grin. “I think all of you will  afterwards, too. We can all drink some after we finish catching our  colds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At this,  everybody except Shimako, who was still caught up in her own  thoughts, looked towards the glass door, and a collective sigh seemed  to run through them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whose  idea was this again?” Sei asked with a slight grimace. Simply by  the draft through the door, they could tell it was far chillier  outside than they had anticipated.  There was such a thing as a warm  rain, but it was rare and apparently, they were simply not lucky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  seem to recall you backing it up fairly strongly,” Sachiko said  with a sort of forced sternness.  “And I do think it’s too late  to back out at this point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Says  who?” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  did not point, (ladies did not point) but instead turned her head  towards the front desk, where Satoi Tanaka and Kiyomi Yoshida were  looking at them with raised eyebrows, Kiyomi with a small grin on her  face that Sachiko could not entirely place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  fans await,” Rei said, and the two behind the desk waved.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  can hold your towels for you if you like,” Kiyomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  an excellent idea,” Sachiko said before anybody could object. A  minute later, and the towels were gathered up and safely behind the  wood front desk. Shimako had been unreceptive to any of this until  Yoshino had asked her directly to please hand her the towel around  her chest, which the girl had done almost unconsciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And so,  all that was left was to actually go outside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Easier  said than done, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  getting chilly just looking at it,” Yumi murmured. Sachiko put a  hand on her head, and when the girl looked up, she saw a smile from  Sachiko brighter than any she had seen in almost a year.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  then,” she said, “it doesn’t make sense to simply stand there  looking at it, does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko?”  Sei said, her voice a little incredulous. “Are you…stupid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  smiled at Sei.  “No,” she said.<br />
      <em>What  the hell are you, then?<br />
        I’m  …<br />
        Giddy.<br />
        That’s  the right word exactly.<br />
        Why?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had no idea. She only knew that she felt as though a huge weight had  been lifted off her shoulders, and that she had Rei to thank for  that.  It had been there for less than ten minutes, but already it  had felt as though she might have simply been crushed to death if it  had lasted much longer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled at Rei, who grinned back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  right!” Rei said, projecting her best kendo-instructor voice.  “Everybody, no more messing around! Outside, now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino,  catching a ride on the sudden wave of energy coming from Rei and  Sachiko, opened the door, to small whoops from Kiyomi and an amused  look from Satoi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako  still stood against the wall, studying that strange, intangible  space, and it seemed that she might do that forever, until Yumi left  Sachiko’s side and crept up to Shimako’s with a single backwards  glance at Sachiko, who for possibly the first time in her life felt  not even the slightest regret that Yumi was no longer there.  She  didn’t know what had gone on between Shimako and Sei, but it must  have been bad if Shimako was still reeling like this.  Everybody fell  silent, and Yumi, her face now also shining with that radiant energy  that seemed to be catching like wildfire, turned around to face the  group and held up three fingers silently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three  fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two  fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  glanced at Yumi and wondered momentarily at how lucky Sachiko  Ogasawara truly was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  once, Sachiko and Sei were almost on the save wavelength at that  moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  finger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  looked at Rei, who smiled lovingly back.  Yoshino had the feeling  that one of Rei’s halfway matronly <em>oh I’m so glad you’re  here and okay </em>hugs was in her future. It was a halfway pleasant  thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  hand closed into a fist, and then several things happened at once:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All of  them bolted straight out into the cold, perhaps inspired by some wave  of monstrous stupidity, or perhaps goaded into it by the fact that  Rei Hasekura and Sachiko Ogasawara would be hot on their tails if  they didn’t. Yumi grabbed onto Shimako’s bare arm and yanked her  out; the latter girl gave a small yelp, whether at the shock or the  surprise of  being so suddenly interrupted, Sachiko didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh, yes,  it was cold.  It was cold and wet, but they got used to it fast  enough that when Yumi began to bolt towards the lake, everybody  followed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  Sachiko Ogasawara.  Even the girl who had come close to shrieking at  a simple coffee stain on a cheap swimsuit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They all  dived in, Shimako no longer needing to be led by Yumi.  The lake was  actually a great deal warmer than the air and so they stayed there  for a while. Eventually, Sachiko caught up to Yumi, and Yumi needed  no other provocation to veritably fling herself into her<em> grande  soeur</em>’s arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As they  hugged, Sachiko felt something else prickling the bottom of her  belly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  ignored it. It was for later, she felt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  this, after all, was the present.  It was not to be lived in the  future,<br />
      <em>(o-sake  isn’t that what Sei wanted to bring did she actually bring that?  That’s illegal)</em><br />
  nor  in the past,<br />
  <em>(there  is no way you can get past the fact that you are simply not normal.  You do not belong with them)</em><br />
  but  right there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Yumi  was warm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  Yumi, in what she would later call a moment of unthinking giddiness,  kissed Sachiko as high as she could reach, which wound up being on  the collarbone.  It was a light, quick thing, and Yumi pulled back  almost as soon as she had done it, her face red with embarrassment,  and Sachiko felt herself begin to laugh. It tickled. It was not the  sort of<br />
      <em>(memory.  There is a memory here.<br />
        This  isn’t the past leave me be.)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unpleasant,  unwarranted tickle that Sachiko was used to, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  nice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Yumi finally left to join Yoshino in an epic quest to dunk Shimako,  who, in spite of her head being completely drenched already by the  pouring rain, refused to submerge her head in the water, Sachiko saw  something else:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was  very beautiful.  Her face shone, pale like the moon, even through the  gray haze of the rain.  Her body was slim, the lines which made up  her outline smooth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is it  really okay to think that about your petite…about Yumi?<br />
  (this  is the present)<br />
  I’ll  think about it later.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  turned out to be just fine.</span></p>
