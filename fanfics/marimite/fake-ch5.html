<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This one  is distinctly less disturbing than the rest.  I hope you guys weren’t  too attached to a vision of Sachiko as the world’s biggest mental  case, because, in spite of how frightening I think her head is, she’s  not all-gone.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Let me  be the fire in your head.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beyond the  sun</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In an  ideal relationship between a <em>petite soeur </em>and her <em>grande  soeur, awkward silences </em>were what you shared when you were both  in the lavatory, unable to make conversation. Few relationships were  so ideal; even Rei and Yoshino, as comfortable as they had been as  very small children, back before it became really important to fill  every gap in conversation with inane, meaningless words, shared the  occasional awkward space; sometimes over the phone, sometimes walking  to school on a bad day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The same  held true for Yumi and Sachiko.  And though neither would have  admitted it in a court of law, they spent their first minute  together, alone, in over three months in mildly uncomfortable  silence. It was, at least, uncomfortable on Sachiko’s end; later,  for a while, they would both attribute it to the bad taste left in  their mouths by Sei’s tasteless exit, or to Sachiko’s  embarrassment about what had happened, or…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or  really, anything except for what it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko,  not entirely sure what to say in the wake of…everything, really,  stared intently at the hem of Yumi’s jeans, willing herself not to  think about what was happening so hard; trained social butterfly or  not, anybody who worried themselves excessively froze up eventually,<br />
      <em>and  lost</em><br />
  and  that wasn’t Sachiko.  She hadn’t even frozen up when<br />
  <em>not  thinking about that</em><br />
  her  stomach hurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact,  it hurt quite a bit.  She put a hand protectively over her stomach,  clutching it in just that little bit further, as though if she  huddled herself up as tight as she could, maybe her pain would vanish  completely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  eyes widened and she gave a little gasp; Sachiko imagined it was, for  her, a bit like watching an epileptic wince in pain; unsure as to  whether or not they were about to have an attack, <em>and then what do  you do? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What <em>would </em>Yumi do? If Sachiko were to have some inexplicable  attack right here?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Would  she get fed up? </em>If you’re not going to make an effort to heal,  I’m not going to stick around while you mope around. <em>Is that  what she would say?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pain lanced up through Sachiko’s torso again, and then turned to  something worse, something queasy and sickening. She gasped, clamped  a hand to her mouth as her eyes widened in the kind of terror only  visible on a sober person’s face just before they vomited.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>!”  Yumi cried, and, in a single fearless, graceful motion befitting of  some of the nun-nurses at Lillian, grabbed the (currently empty)  vomit-pan from the table by Sachiko’s bed, stood up, and brought it  underneath Sachiko’s mouth.  With her other hand, cool and dry, she  pulled Sachiko’s hair back gently from where it had been clustering  about her cheeks.  A second later, Sachiko lost the battle with her  gorge, moved her hand, and threw up into the pan, giving a small,  frightened retch with each heave of her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  was empty, <em>(when did I have food in the first place?)</em> she  looked back up at Yumi, slowly, her mind swimming with fear and  shame.  It took her a second to fully comprehend the look on the  girl’s face, but she needn’t have feared; Yumi was looking down  at her, her expression equal parts concern and<br />
      <em>love</em><br />
  affection,  and smiling, her open face hiding nothing.  Her face <em>couldn’t </em>hide anything.  Yumi’s face, Sachiko felt, could not have been  anything but the most honest thing on the planet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her <em>petite soeur </em>didn’t say anything. How could she? She  couldn’t ask if Sachiko was okay, because it was obvious she  wasn’t, head hovering not a foot above a pan full of her own vomit,  still occasionally spilling forth a wet hiccup.  She couldn’t ask  if she could do anything to help, because she knew that Sachiko  couldn’t ask for anything better than this.  She couldn’t talk  about something off-topic, to try and get Sachiko’s mind off of it,  because…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  it wouldn’t have been honest.  It wouldn’t have been Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So she  stood there, her hand on Sachiko’s forehead, cooling it and holding  her long, dark hair back, her other hand holding the vomit-pan under  Sachiko’s head until it was clear that Sachiko was done with  everything but the hiccups. <em>Those </em>battles, Sachiko thought,  she would win.  Before had been…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What had  it been?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setting  the pan down carefully—a lot of what was inside was liquid, which  meant that there hadn’t really been that much in her stomach after  all—Yumi sat down next to Sachiko and put an arm around her a  little protectively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Look  how easily she fills the role you can’t, </em>that small, bitter  thing inside of her pointed out. <em>What kind of mother will you be  if you can’t even act like a decent </em>onee-sama</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  kind of </em>wife <em>will you be…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  pushed the thought out of her mouth, about half a second before Yumi  pulled Sachiko’s head to her shoulder, and for a moment, she felt  her stomach vanish and her head begin a steady ascent towards the  clouds. A smile drifted vaguely onto her face, and her lips parted  slightly as she let out her breath in a small sigh…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, as the air rose from her mouth and passed her nose, the thought  hit her like an alarm, an agonizing, painful sound that gave her the  impression that maybe her brain was a bell, and her skull the little  red casing that made the sound really <em>echo </em>in a person’s  ear, gifting them with that lasting headache that reminds them, <em>hey,  just so you don’t forget, you stood a little too close to that  alarm today. </em> She jerked upwards, away from Yumi, her hand going  to her mouth for the second time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t a bell in her head, though. Her brain vibrated against her  skull and the sound it made was <em>BREATH. </em>Breath. Her breath,  sour with the odor and taste of vomit, still fresh in her mouth.<br />
      <em>BREATHBREATHBREATHBREATHBREATHBREATH</em><br />
  Her  breath.  She had just vomited twice; as her lips parted, this became  fairly apparent from the sour, pungent odor emanating from between  her teeth.  This wasn’t just a little error in etiquette, one which  might cause her mother or old etiquette coach to snap at her harshly;  it was an outrage, like wearing a high-cut skirt to a formal  occasion, or breaking wind at the dinner table.  It wasn’t just  breaching manners; it was taking a shit on them. As far as that bell<br />
  <em>BREATH  YOU DISGUSTING BITCH</em><br />
  was  concerned, she may as well have not brushed her teeth that morning,  or any morning for the past week before an important event.  She may  as well have vomited on Yumi. It was the absolute epitome of<br />
  <em>yumi  must think im<br />
    how  could anyone<br />
    BREATH  how can she stand to be anywhere near me when im this disgusting</em><br />
  Sachiko  felt her gorge rise again, for the second time in less than ten  minutes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Stress?  Maybe that was what brought </em>that <em>attack on…</em> he said. <em>But  peptic ulcers are caused by a disease. </em>Did that mean that her  stomach just rose and fell at intervals, or was there something to  that <em>stress </em>thing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  was <em>gently prompting </em>her head down, back towards where Yumi’s  shoulder<br />
      <em>couldn’t  be</em><br />
  was.   It was soft and warm, and it seemed to possess a queer cooling  ability as well—the burn in her stomach faded nearly as soon as she  touched it, Yumi’s hand still gently cupping her jaw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does  it hurt very much?” Yumi said quietly, her voice laden with  sympathy, but underneath it, Sachiko saw something most<br />
      <em>disgusting</em><br />
  ladylike:  It was Sachiko’s <em>out. </em>All she had to do was lie and say no,  and Yumi would let her go, and that would be the end of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it  wasn’t, that was the unfathomable thing.  It wasn’t, because <em>Yumi, </em>for her training from Sachiko and the whole of Lillian,  for all of her faking it in front of everybody from Sachiko’s  parents to the teachers, wasn’t.  She could be ladylike, but deep  down, she <em>wasn’t; </em>and Sachiko knew, somehow, that that was  what she was seeing right now, was <em>deep-down. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Deep  down, Yumi was just caring. More like one of the older nuns, with  their sly winks and their oddly practical, if oft-outdated, (<em>if a  boy keeps adjusting his </em>jinbei <em>around you, watch out, he’s  down a well without a rope for you</em>) advice, than the Ladies (with  a capital ‘L’) that seemed to spread themselves across Japan,  produced at a steady rate of a few hundred a year by that school; the  ones with perfect posture, cool, calculating speech, and reserved  smiles that never seemed to reach their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had an <em>out, </em>provided free of charge, if unwittingly, by Yumi.  All she had to do was take it, and Yumi would leave her to tend to  her unkempt appearance; and unkempt it was, she knew, with a kind of  preternatural sense that she could never properly explain: Her hair  was tousled, as though she’d just woken from a long sleep, (which  she had) and if she were to look in a mirror, she was almost certain  she would find dark rings about her eyes from where her makeup had  rubbed in.  She looked like something her mother would have actually  deemed to describe with a dirty word, and even thinking about it  brought that familiar queasy bubble back into her stomach.  She  looked <em>awful, </em>and she knew it, and she thought that Yumi knew  it too. Of course she would have wanted Yumi gone—<em>everyone </em>gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  trick to it, though, was that she didn’t want to.  That wasn’t to  say that she wasn’t tempted, even <em>pulled </em>to by her mother’s  voice, still ringing in her head like a fire alarm.  Only that  another part of her—a part fundamentally imbued with what some  might have called a <em>deep courage</em>—refused, flat out.  It was  a part of her that Sachiko had rarely seen, and knew almost nothing  about.  Courage was something that Ladies needed, her mother had  said, but only later; for now, she was best to bury that part of her  and do what needed to be done.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  here it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And here  was Yumi. Maybe Sachiko did look awful; maybe her hair <em>was </em>tousled  and unkempt, maybe flecked with the bits of vomit that Sei wasn’t  able to get out, and yet, Yumi still ran her fingers through it  gently.  Maybe her face <em>did </em>look as though it hadn’t been  made up in weeks, pale and distraught; and yet, Yumi still cupped it  gently in her small, soft hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Sachiko murmured, and the alarms only blew stronger in her head, but  this time, somebody was shielding her from them:  That <em>somebody </em>that she had always known, but had forgotten existed; the part  which her family had so unmercifully crushed every time it had poked  its head out and stood up to their conditioning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Sachiko’s grandmother died, it had fought tooth and nail with the  side of her that refused to be seen crying in public.  It had fought  with every ounce of its courage to do the thing which required the  most bravery of all, and let her guard down around Yumi; it had  almost succeeded, many times, and so Sachiko had called it cowardice,  and had called her cowardice bravery.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>True  strength, </em>it said, its voice clear and true, poking its head out  from its grave for the first time in many months, <em>comes from  trusting others. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  Sachiko knew it was right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So she  let herself be held. And after a while, she took Yumi in her arms and  held her close as well, and<em> then </em>her <em>petite soeur </em>did  what she had been desperately needing to do for so long:  She began  to cry softly, and the pressure about Sachiko’s breasts increased  as Yumi pulled her <em>onee-sama </em>close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  missed you, Yumi,” Sachiko whispered, speaking with honesty so pure  it was relieving.  “I missed you so much. I…” <em>didn’t know  what to do with myself without you, and all those things that </em>you <em>taught </em>me—<em>how to be honest, with others and with myself;  how to let my guard down and vent all of the pressure that never  stops building inside of me…I forgot all of them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  mother’s voice went silent. Of course it did: It wasn’t really  her mother.  It was her; it was her own cowardice, taught to her by  somebody who was afraid of her daughter’s strength, afraid of her  daughter becoming independent of her, of not needing her anymore; by  somebody, maybe, who was just afraid of being truly alone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, <em>onee-sama,</em>”Yumi whispered, her hands trembling  on Sachiko’s jaw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  didn’t miss you; </em>that voice, that horrible, terrible voice,  seemed to have redoubled itself. <em> She doesn’t need you. </em>You’re <em>the one so dependant on</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shut  up.  Shut up, you horrible, horrible woman, and get the hell away  from me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  the voice fell silent again, and this time, Sachiko thought, it was  gone for good. It was a mistake that would, eventually, nearly cost  her everything she held dearly to herself, but perhaps, for now, it  was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  all, if she didn’t relieve her stress, how would she be able to  leave the hospital bed?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  that, right now, she had any intention of moving anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  tracked their doctor down about half an hour later, after she and  Sachiko had stopped crying, and spoken a few choice words to each  other.  Most of them had been words of endearment, but not all—some  had been about more present things.  She was only gone for perhaps  ten minutes, but they were not easy minutes for Sachiko, who felt a  little niggle at the back of her head almost as soon as the girl  left:  A children’s tune, familiar in the way that a man you saw  every day but never spoke to might have been familiar:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All-gone  all-gone cattail fish is all-gone, ne’er seen again</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> where to where to into the sea its so blue; now we start again</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All-gone  all-gone its all-gone. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  gnawed at the back of her sanity for reasons that she couldn’t  explain, but she shut it out.  It was easier this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor, who arrived alongside Yumi, gave Sachiko a final  examination—her eyes, her mouth, her heartbeat, (a little weak, but  that was to be expected, he said, just no more blood-thinners).  He  even gave a quick examination of the foul-smelling pan near Sachiko’s  bed, and then asked Sachiko if she had been under a lot of stress  lately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  knowing what else to say, Sachiko nodded, and he told her to keep  away from whatever it was for a while—stress, he said, caused an  influx of stomach acid, which was what caused that burning feeling  people felt in their stomachs when they were nervous or anxious. He  added, in the sort of undertone usually reserved for talking about  private bodily functions, that if she was fond of the bottle or the  pipe, now would be a good time to give those up as well. She told him  that she did nothing of the sort, and he smiled jovially, as though  he hadn’t said anything at all.  “You’re excused,” he said.  “Just get plenty of rest, take your medication—I gave you your  prescription, didn’t I? Good—and make sure you take it easy for a  while.” He flashed them an easy smile, and Sachiko immediately  understood why Sei had trusted him.  It was the kind of smile that  said, <em>just between us.  All of this is just between us.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor left, and Sachiko got dressed—Yumi had brought her fresh  clothes when they’d left for the hospital—behind a curtain, since  the glass windows into the hall were large enough that a nurse could  see a patient if the door was closed and she was in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  they walked out of the hospital, it was hand-in-hand, Sachiko’s  heart burning as it hadn’t in a long time; not since Lillian, and a  sweeter time than this had been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  seemed a little distant, but she had told Sachiko about that well in  advance: She was thinking.  About what, Sachiko didn’t know, but  she allowed herself to be content in waiting.  Yumi would speak when  she was good and ready.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  always did.</span></p>
