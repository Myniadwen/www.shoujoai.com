<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Sachiko says “Miss Satou,” she means something much like <em>Satou-san. </em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I say  hello / you say hello / we’ll always kiss the sky / spring, summer,  fall, winter / what a wonderful world</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We’ll  walk the unknown path to the sky.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Good for  You</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had a driver’s license, but only on principle—her family had  demanded it of her, almost as soon as she was legally able, just in  case. <em>Just in case what? </em>She had wondered. <em>Just in case my  driver is assassinated by a group of Yakuza, and my cell phone is out  of batteries, and there are no police anywhere nearby, and they leave  me stranded in a bad part of town, and my only other way to get home  is to walk, which means I may as well put on a short skirt and become  a whore, because god damned if a member of the Ogasawara Group is  going to </em>walk <em>along a perfectly good road.  Just in case, that  happens, I should have a driver’s license. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  thought had occurred to her rather wildly at the time—a moment of  annoyance, perhaps, at the hassle of acquiring something she would  never use. Now, however, she was rather happy that she’d gone  through the rigorous months of Driver’s Ed—it made the car she  was riding in seem less like a roller coaster that had derailed  itself approximately as soon as it had acquired enough speed with  which to do so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so,  for the first few minutes of their drive together, Sachiko had a hard  time really believing that she was where she was—perhaps the danger  of the situation had not yet impressed itself upon her, or perhaps it  had simply shocked her into a pleasant, grinning, humming ignorance  common in mental institutions.  She <em>observed</em> the car in which  she was a passenger blazing down the road, weaving between cars with  the speed and skill of a motorcyclist begging for an early grave;  observed just how far the speedometer read over the speed limit; she<em> observed </em>other, angrier drivers than Sei honking and flashing  rude signs at her. She <em>observed</em> her own natural, perfectly  understandable fear, but she did not <em>participate. </em>It was much  the same, one might reflect, as a man whose wife has just died, a man  on whom the gravity and weight of loss has not yet taken its toll.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For such  a man, there is always a point at which it <em>hits </em>him. Where the  full weight of everything he no longer has, a vacuum which threatens  to turn him inside out and render him a useless hunk of blubber,  finds him and does its worst.  People rarely <em>remember </em>this  point; they only remember the transition. One day they were perfectly  alright, <em>coping </em>with their loss, their problem, <em>dealing  with it </em>nicely, and the next day they were a mess, a heap, a  useless shell good only for producing salt water from the eyes and  mucus from the nose at the rate of a toddler with a head cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When Sei  stopped at her first red light, about five minutes into their drive,  two things<em> hit </em>Sachiko. The first was that she was in a life  or death situation; that Sei could easily kill the lot of them at any  moment, and the only thing she could do about it was shriek, which  she had a feeling would go in one of Sei’s ears, possibly echo a  bit in her head, and then slide lifelessly out the other.  If she hit  another car going at this speed, Yumi would fly off her lap, and sail  up, between the seats, and through the windshield, leaving only rags  of Yumi for her to hold tight to her and hug and pat her head when  she was sick and…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the  second thing she realized was that she did not know the half of it.  She did not know one-quarter of the things inside of her; she was  only now just aware of the prospect of losing Yumi, and was only just  now aware of the fear that instilled in her. She was afraid of dying  herself, and she hadn’t known <em>this </em>before, either. Two  overarching fears which had not been there a single instant before;  now threatening to bend her double in pain and anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, a third thing.  A third realization, just a little whisper next  to the buzzing tension already in her head:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Three  months.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not  true.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Can’t  be true.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  yet…something about it made an inexplicable sort of sense; it  appealed to some intuition that all of us have at one level or  another—just as a man who has lost his wallet is calmly certain  that it’s still somewhere in his house and so does not fret,  Sachiko was calmly certain that, whether she liked it or not, she  would be married three months from now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Three  months.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And,  another word as well, one that she could not quite put her finger on;  something which danced on the tip of her tongue and on the edge of  her synapses, but did not come to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that was just stupid intuition. It was just anxiety nagging at  her stomach and her head, and that was all it was, there was nothing  to do with</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  stepped on the gas pedal before the other word could occur to  her—Lead Foot to the rescue—and Sachiko found her head thrown  back against the fabric of the seat, and Yumi’s head thrown into  her breasts, and they rocketed down the road, none of them speaking  but rather conveying their emotions in the most primitive way, by the  tones of the noises they made—from Yoshino, a delighted screech;  from Shimako, a frightened, meek sound, utterly at odds with the  smooth confidence she had displayed entering the car; from Rei, an  exasperated sigh.  From Yumi, a squeal of excitement, a little like  Yoshino’s</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  Yumi, an excited squeal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In spite  of all of the fear and anxiety, Sachiko smiled a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  Sachiko: Barely audible under the sounds of other, louder women, from  under the dull hum of the car’s engine carrying them smoothly (in  all spite of the driver) to their destination, from under the blaring  horns of other drivers, angry and uncertain at how such a pretty  woman could drive such a small car like such a goddamn drunken man, a  small, happy laugh, touched with nervousness and uncertainty, but  displaying nonetheless an unmistakable sense of enjoyment and  happiness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, from Yumi, unbeknownst to Sachiko, whose only view of the girl  was the small, almond curve of her eye, a small grin which had  nothing to do with the car ride, and everything to do with the sound  coming from her <em>onee-sama.</em> <em>Onee-sama</em>, whose hands  tightened around her waist as she made this small noise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  folded her hands overtop Sachiko’s. “How do you like joyriding,<em> onee-sama?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  didn’t answer. She didn’t need to.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
About  midway through the ride, Yoshino and Sei began speaking in hushed  tones, their faces the spitting image of a pair of thieves, thick as  the cliché, who knew they were about to hit it big.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  did.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  pulled into Rei’s alley about ten minutes later, and piled out of  the car in as orderly a fashion as they entered it, which was to say  that they managed a fairly decent single file, but they lost,  momentarily, the image of genteelness to which most were accustomed  to seeing them possess so adequately. First to get out were Sei and  Yoshino, being up front, and by the time the mess of piling out of  the back seat was through, the two of them had vanished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei,”  Sachiko said warily, “Do you know where your <em>petite soeur </em>has  gone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  shook her head, shrugging, and Sachiko saw she was thinking precisely  the same thing she was: <em>It’s not the fact that Yoshino has gone  off somewhere that is troubling.  It is the fact that Sei is there as  well. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, <em>onee-sama?” </em>Yumi asked, shaking her head out as she  closed the car door behind her.  “Is something wrong?” <em>I  probably look as troubled as I ever do in public, so of course she’d  be concerned.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  at all,” Sachiko said mildly.  “Nothing to be concerned about,  just—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  that Yoshino and Sei seem to have gone off somewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  blinked, apparently nonplussed.  “Is that bad?” Sachiko couldn’t  help but find this mildly annoying—Yumi was probably the only one  who didn’t see that Sei could sometimes cause genuine trouble along  with her harmless jokes; if only because she seemed to lack the  restraint which the rest of them—and really, most every other  graduate of Lillian—possessed.  Honestly, Sachiko could not think  of anything more dangerous than a woman who was considered to be a  Lady by the entire world, but did not think of herself as being bound  by any such title. It was like allowing a well-dressed thief into a  roomful of unsuspecting gentry, though Sachiko was sure Yumi would  have told her that she was being overdramatic.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t that Sei wasn’t a good person, or at least Sachiko didn’t  think so. The girl seemed to honestly care about her friends, and  seemed willing to go to great lengths to help them if they were in  need—<em>why else would Sei have done what she had done for  me?</em>—rather, it seemed that Sei simply cared nothing for her  title or status, and so she could lure Ladies who <em>were</em> conscious of title and statusinto doing things which might  damage their reputation, and she could lure them simply because they  were not suspicious of her in the least.<em> Maybe Rei, Yoshino, and  Shimako do not have a reputation to consider, but I do, and so does  Yumi, because Yumi is mine.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  did not seem possessive in the least to Sachiko.  Sei would have  understood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  sighed.  “I believe it may be, Yumi,” she said.  “I believe it  may be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t understand, <em>onee-sama</em>,” Yumi said. “What—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh.  Oh dear.”  This from Shimako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh.  Oh  dear.  Sachiko turned to face where Shimako was looking, towards  Yoshino’s house, where two feminine figures were advancing on them,  their arms laden with…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh dear.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sei had  been surprised to find that Yoshino was stronger than she was.  She  didn’t know the girl very well, since she and Rei had never been  close, but she had heard about the heart surgery, and so had in mind  more of a petite, fragile image of the girl who was now carrying a  heavy box—filled with what Sei called <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">goodies, </span></em>which Yoshino  did not question, but only smiled a little deviously at.  Originally,  Sei had thought they would have to make two trips, since Yoshino’s  small, delicate arms weren’t long enough to carry all of the things  Sei had clasped to her stomach, and Sei had assumed that Yoshino  wouldn’t be able to move that box short of dragging it along the  ground; she herself had had enough trouble getting it out of the  front seat of the car (unnoticed, at that) and into Yoshino’s house  where they could stock up on a few things that Sei had forgotten to  pack.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Pack? </em>Yoshino had asked when Sei had first brought it up in the car.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  bet.  We’re going on a trip, you know? We need to pack for that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  didn’t hear anything about that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is  that a problem?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  don’t remember saying that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t a problem at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or at  least, it wasn’t a problem for them.  Walking towards the group,  their arms laden with what Yoshino (and Sei as well, though for some  reason she didn’t admit it openly) simply called <em>stuff, </em>Sei  wondered briefly if it would be a problem for any of <em>them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably, </em>she decided with a small, predatory grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  all, if one was to take a trip to an unknown place for an unknown  length of time, it was probably best that at least <em>one </em>of the  people found the whole thing inconvenient. Inconvenience, after all,  was a damn good indication that what you were doing was not only  spontaneous, but utterly unusual.  And wasn’t spontaneity the  mother of honesty?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  thought so.  Trips were a good time to be honest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Isn’t  that a little like kidnapping, though?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  again, Sei decided that it probably was, a little grin on her face  that Sachiko would not have entirely trusted if she saw it. Not that  Sachiko trusted her anyway—Sei was fairly certain Sachiko had  precisely zero trust in her, in fact, and it was probably because Sei  sometimes acted as though she was out to steal Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or at  least, that was probably what Sachiko thought.  Really, Sei found the  whole thing to be a sign of almost pervasive insecurity in the tall,  dark-haired girl; maybe that was what she was hoping to get at.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That she  was probably being too nosy never crossed her mind.  Sachiko was  Yumi’s <em>onee-sama, </em>and the insecurity this girl felt led a  lot of people—Yumi included—to a lot of hurt sometimes.  That was  what insecurity did, after all—that was all it did.  It hurt  people.  And the only way to get at such a closely guarded woman was  to get her when she wasn’t guarded—something one could only do  unexpectedly, spontaneously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  really, somebody who wasn’t Sei might have thought, all Sei wanted  to do was help.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody  who wasn’t Sei was Yoshino, who was cleverer than she let on.  She  had picked up on this, not by prying at Sei, but simply by listening  to her, by watching her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All  she wants to do is help. God save them all, but I’m going to help  too.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  decided that and never once looked back.  She decided that she liked  Sei quite a bit.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Five</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sachiko  was the first to react, as was often the case.  “Miss Satou,” she  said, stepping forward, almost as though to shield Yumi from some  unseen, unperceived danger, “What is that?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  now,” Sei said with a big, open smile.  “I’d think that was  obvious to somebody as sharp as you, Sachiko. It’s a bag of  sleeping gear—blankets, pajamas, toothbrushes, and the like. See,  look here; you can even see one of the shirts poking its little arm  out of there. It’s quite large, but it’s not heavy, so please,  don’t fall over yourselves to help me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  and Rei could only gape in open-mouthed astonishment; Yumi was  watching intently, her face denoting something that was not entirely  excitement, but was certainly close; Shimako looked very much like a  death-row inmate who has just been informed that, no, her sentence  has not been overturned, and would she like to be well-done or  extra-crispy. Sei could actually see some of the color drop from her  naturally pale face, and she couldn’t help but feel a little sorry  for the girl, who had probably already caught onto what was going on. <em>She’s sharp. She’s gonna do fine.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sharp,  yes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Good at  dealing with people…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not so  much.  If Shimako were ever to come to her for help—an  impossibility, undoubtedly—that would probably be where she started  and finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Who  the hell are you to offer to help a girl like that anyway?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  shook her head, and Sachiko frowned; not because of the unexpected  movement, but because it was a motion she recognized—it was the  quick toss of the head of somebody who felt that their situation  necessitated a clearer mind but <em>now. </em> Of somebody whose head  was nagging at them, and of somebody who could think of no other, no  better way than to try and rattle it into submission. A twinge of  empathy crossed over her chest, though she kept it from her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what,” Sachiko said, “are you planning on doing with a bag of  sleeping supplies, Miss Satou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  plan on using them to sleep,” Sei said as though it was the most  obvious thing in the world. “I hope you plan on doing the same,  because otherwise you’re probably going to smell quite bad quite  soon, and I’m not sure Yumi or I will particularly appreciate  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  giggled at this, and Sachiko, suddenly redder in the face than she  had expected Sei to be able to make her, stepped back. “I don’t  think I understand, Sei. Please, explain yourself.” Her tone  suggested that she understood perfectly, and Sei knew in an instant  that she was trying to overpower her, trying to get her to back  down—not because she didn’t want to go, necessarily—she hadn’t  had enough time to make up her mind about that yet, and she may not  even be certain that that was precisely what was going on—but  because that was what Sachiko did if she was confronted by one of her  own in a place where nobody was watching: She pushed back.  Yumi  could attest to that. She would never do it in public, nor to anybody  who she was not intimately familiar with.  Sei supposed that she  should take that as flattery unto itself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei took  a deep breath and then grinned widely again, trying to drown out that  little niggle in the back of her head that kept informing her as  loudly as it could that she was making a huge, terrible, unimaginably  large mistake as best she could.  “I mean that we’re going on a  trip. Think of it as an extended joyride in a van instead of a  beetle, only instead of going home after a few hours, we have to try  and find a place to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  indeed what Sachiko was thinking. Her expression did not contort but  her insides did.  She prepared a verbal rebuke, which she thought as  she prepared it to be a milder, more modern equivalent of a feudal  lord demanding the suicide of a vassal for a comment made in ill  company.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what makes you think that I will have anything to do with—” but  she stopped, because in her peripheral vision, she caught a glimpse  of what was near her: a short, pretty, pigtailed girl, with a  delighted expression on her face—one that, Sachiko knew, she could  not have covered up if all of existence depended on it. She saw  Yumi’s face, and she realized something: She wanted this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Aren’t  you just fighting this because it’s absurd?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of  course I am! It’s </em>absurd! <em>It’s beyond absurd, it’s  positively </em>stupid! <em>You can’t just disappear for  god-knows-how-long without telling anybody, and if you tell anybody,  you’ll be forbidden to go.  Your life is not your own and has not  been for as long as </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then  do something about it.</em> The thought forced its way into her head  with a startling speed and power—and what was more interesting was  that it was not in her own voice, but rather in the voice of the girl  who was now staring at her so intently; that short, sweet,  indefatigable girl. <em>If it’s not yours, take it back. Who cares  what they think? Call Suguru and tell him you’ll be out for a few  days, that you’ve decided to take a trip to the summer house.  Tell  the Sawamuras that you’ll be there in a few days.  Suguru can draw  his own conclusions and I’m sure I can…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  sure I can plan this out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I can  do it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  will.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped, deflated, her shoulders relaxed, (though her expression was  not) and, after taking a moment, nodded. To the amazement of  everybody—<em>everybody­</em>—she even smiled a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  will you need from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei was  actually taken aback. She recovered quickly, and said, “Get Rei to  pop her trunk for me, for starters. I’d like to park my car in  place of hers until we get back, so we’ll have to do a neat little  business with her parents. After that, all I need is for you to  promise me that you won’t have a bunch of balls of muscle and  testosterone out looking for you when you disappear for a few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can  do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  nodded at her.  “Alright.  In that case, all I need from you is  your sweet little self.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  frowned. “I would prefer not to be referred to as such in the  future, if you believe you can bring yourself to refrain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei only  laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had a funny, happy feeling that she might be doing that too. She  hoped that feeling wouldn’t fade; she wished this very much.</span></p>
