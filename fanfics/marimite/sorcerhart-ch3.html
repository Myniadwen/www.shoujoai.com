<h1>The Sorceress's Heart (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/andwick.html">Andwick</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sorcerhart-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p>Glossary. Aniki -- older brother, but not necessarily a blood relation. Imouto -- 
younger sister, but in this story at least, not necessarily a blood relation either; mainly 
refers to one's junior in the Sorceress's Guild, and is just what they say instead of 
"petite soeur," because they don't know French. "About five kin" -- You can probably google 
"japanese system weights measures" yourselves, but it does no harm to say that one kin is 
about 601 grams, or roughly 1.3 pounds. So, a fair amount of rice. The Japanese system of 
commerce at the time seems to have been rather different from anything we know. The Eastern 
and Western Markets existed in Heian Kyo more or less as I've described them -- though I've 
done a certain amount of unjustified guessing with regard to the Western Market -- but there 
was also apparently no actual merchant class at the time, and pretty much all buying and 
selling was controlled by the government, also known as the Fujiwara family. So I don't 
really know who the marketeers were. Research continues. But there was no free enterprise 
system as we understand it. Then again, they don't appear to have had a Sorceress's Guild 
either, or indeed any really solid guild-like excrescences until early in the Kamakura 
period.</p><p>If you like, simply suppose that as I was crossing a bridge of dreams, I ran 
across this complete fantod of a world, which you can believe in exactly as much as it 
pleases you to believe in it at any given moment. That's sort of the approach I'm taking. 
And since it's sort of what the Heian courtiers believed about the world they lived in, it's 
oddly appropriate.</p><p>Enough blithering. Forward.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>III. The 
Markets Of the Left And Right</p><p>Sachiko dreamt of a fox. The fox was peering out of a 
hole, just ahead of her. She had been going through the brush, looking for edible plants, 
and was suddenly confronted with this furry, peak-eared, sharp-nosed, laughing-tongued, 
gleaming-eyed face. It looked at her expectantly, as if waiting for her to speak.</p><p>"How 
do you do," she said.</p><p>"As well as I may," said the fox. "What are you up to?"</p><p>"I 
am searching for food."</p><p>"Ah, yes," said the fox. "Naturally. But we all need food, and 
you are a stranger here. Will you take the food that was meant to feed those who live in 
these parts?"</p><p>"If I am not to die in these parts, I am," Sachiko answered.</p><p>"Only 
so much as you need then. Try there, down the bank. In the long grasses, you may find 
onion-weed and meat-foil."</p><p>Sachiko went down the bank on all fours. Mist hung over 
everything, and the grasses were thick. She remembered this ridge, except that the air had a 
morning crispness, and the sun was at the west. Something odd about that.</p><p>The fox's 
voice stayed with her. "To your left. Ah, here is dill a-plenty. Shiso and miso, shiitake 
and rice-flower. Jasmine and tearoot, hahhh..."</p><p>Sachiko stopped. She had come upon a 
hole. It was only a little hole, but it was so dark she was almost sure it would swallow her 
whole if she attempted it. She was aware, somewhere, that she was dreaming, and the hole 
looked like it might lead to another dream, a less peaceful and misty one 
altogether.</p><p>"The Lady sleeps down there," said the voice of the fox.</p><p>"The 
Lady?"</p><p>"The Sun that Shines Underground. The Lady of Mud and Mountain, with Nine Tails 
Shining..." the fox sounded reverent.</p><p>Sachiko put a hand on the edge of the hole. Away 
down in the deeps a little light flared, and an eye half-opened and peered redly up at 
Sachiko.</p><p>"Beware how you wake the Lady," said the voice of the fox, a voice suddenly 
made of gnawed twigs and dead leaves. "Beware."</p><p>Sachiko awoke.</p><p>--</p><p>Yumi was 
awake already, watching her.</p><p>"Well. Good morning," Sachiko said.</p><p>Yumi smiled 
shyly. "Good morning," she said.</p><p>"Bath time," Sachiko said.</p><p>They 
rose.</p><p>Yumi just sat there, scratching her head at first. Sachiko went to the cabinet. 
She was thinking about the dream she'd just had -- the details were fading, but she held 
hard to the general gist of it. She was very much alive to the implications of having such a 
dream, such a vivid and disturbing dream, when she had just met the girl she meant to make 
her imouto, and while she was sleeping with that very girl folded in her robes. In fact, 
however, there were a number of different ways such a dream could be interpreted, and 
looking at her filthy yet appealing charge in the morning light, it was very difficult to 
see her as a danger, especially remembering the remarkably soft smile she had smiled upon 
Sachiko's waking... Well... Smiles didn't prove anything, any more than dreams did. There 
was a lot to do, today. For the moment, watchfulness was all.</p><p>She got out a simple 
grey shift. "This isn't elaborate, but you'll wear it after you've bathed. I'll carry it for 
the time being. All right?"</p><p>"Yes, Mistress. What about these?" She indicated the rags 
she was wearing.</p><p>"You'll have no further use for those. We'll put them on a midden 
after the bath. Then I'll have to get you some proper clothes." She closed the 
cabinet.</p><p>"Mistress...I..."</p><p>"Yumi, if there's something on your mind, please 
speak."</p><p>"You...you shouldn't spend too much money on me, Mistress. I'm not 
worthy..."</p><p>From by the cabinet, Sachiko stared at the girl on her pallet, a reversal 
of their positions last night after the lice announcement. Then she went and knelt by 
her.</p><p>"Do you think you're unworthy to serve me, Yumi?"</p><p>From Yumi's face, this 
question might have been torture.</p><p>"Worthiness is an interesting idea," Sachiko went 
on. "We should talk about it more, when we have time. When I first came to the Guild, the 
only daughter of a wealthy, powerful man, I had the opposite problem you have. I thought I 
was worthy of anything and everything, and certainly worthy of far more and better than 
anyone in the Guild seemed willing to bestow on me. I was soon disabused of this. My teacher 
assured me that I was worthy of decent treatment, the same as anyone else in the Guild, but 
that they had no time to pamper and coddle me. 'In your world,' she said, 'it's all a matter 
of who your parents are. Here it's who <i>you</i> are, what you've done, what you can do. 
And you haven't done anything yet.'"</p><p>Yumi had started staring down at her grimy 
fingers, but was now looking at Sachiko in astonishment. "She spoke to you that way? 
Mistress," she added hastily.</p><p>"Yes, she did. I deserved it. And you're making the same 
mistake I made, but in the opposite direction." Sachiko took those soft, grimy little 
fingers in one of her white hands. "You are entering the Sorceresses' Guild as my famula, 
and my prospective student. You are worthy of anything and everything the other young 
students are worthy of. And anyone who says otherwise will have me to reckon with. Including 
you. Do you understand?"</p><p>"I...just...look at me..." Looking away again, in 
shame.</p><p>"Yes. You're a mess. So let's go and do something about that." She stood, and 
hauled Yumi to her feet as she went. "If you're dirty, what else is there to do but clean 
yourself as best you can?"</p><p>--</p><p>Sei sat on a low stone wall near the great Western 
Market. Maeko sat near her. To the south of them, there was a dilapidated street, partially 
inhabited, partially a long, ill-kept series of large lock-boxes disguised as shuttered 
shops. To the north lay an open field, broken here and there by herds of cattle and by 
uneven, weed-choked, incomplete lines of stone, the ghosts of old streets and alleys. To the 
northwest a group of old houses had burned three nights ago and were still smoldering, and 
the stink of it flavored the air. This was the City of the Right, which had over time become 
no city, or the ghost of a city, or perhaps the dark brother of the City of the Left. 
Between the world of the wastes to the north and the unfriendly street on the south was the 
market, a world unto itself. You could buy many of the same things here that you could buy 
in the better-appointed Eastern Market on the other side of the city, but you could also buy 
goods and services you wouldn't necessarily want anyone to know you'd bought. So you had to 
be cautious, as did the people who sold them to you. It was quieter than the Eastern Market; 
it was not a place for loud noises, or sudden moves.</p><p>Sei and Maeko watched as the 
tamer marketeers set up stalls, unrolled mats, laid goods out on display.</p><p>Sei tore a 
hunk of bread off the loaf she was holding and handed it to Maeko.</p><p>"Have you forgiven 
me yet?" Sei wondered.</p><p>"As if my forgiveness was worth one grain of rice to you," 
Maeko sniffed. Still, she accepted the bread and began chewing on it. "Hmmm. Tough. 
Sour."</p><p>"Maybe it's an acquired taste." Sei didn't look at Maeko. She slouched there on 
the wall, her hands on her knees, her elbows sticking out to either side. She looked a bit 
like a praying mantis with a sense of humor. She continued to examine the proceedings of the 
marketeers with constant interest and just the hint of a laugh in her face.</p><p>"Why are 
you out here anyway?" Maeko wondered.</p><p>"Hoping I see someone I 
know."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>Sei said nothing.</p><p>"Why?" Maeko asked.</p><p>"To ask a 
question I'm hoping to ask... Oi! Oooiii! Toshi!" she called.</p><p>She had directed this 
toward a group of men a little way off. It looked as if some kind of meeting had just broken 
up over there, and the men were still standing around in twos and threes. A slender small 
ratlike man -- much smaller than Sei, not much bigger than Maeko -- looked up from a 
conversation he was having, and went right back to it without so much as a 
nod.</p><p>"That's the man?" Maeko asked.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Doesn't seem eager to talk to 
you."</p><p>"He'll come over as soon as he's done... Won't your parents be wondering where 
you are?"</p><p>Maeko grimaced, and stood. "You're really eager to hold on to me. Will I see 
you soon, Sei?"</p><p>"Questioning's almost upon us, pert-buns. I'll be busy, and then I'll 
be out of town for a little."</p><p>"But you are still coming to my wedding?" Maeko wasn't 
looking at Sei. And she was scuffing a toe in the dirt.</p><p>Sei turned her head at last to 
look at Maeko, and Maeko, catching the movement, looked up. Sei looked her in the eye 
calmly. "I can't think why you'd want me there, but I did promise you. Be well, Maeko." She 
meant this, but sounding as if she meant it wasn't easy. <i>I care for you. As much as I 
can.</i></p><p>There was a silence, which involved more toe-scuffing and absence of eye 
contact. Then Maeko said, "I'll be thinking of you, Sei."</p><p>And then she dashed off, 
towards her home.</p><p>Sei watched her go, a little sadly. She hadn't been attached to 
Maeko -- she was careful about attachments, these days -- but she had allowed herself to 
become just that little bit fond of her. It wouldn't be a wrench, letting her go, but a 
slight pang, no question...</p><p><i>Oh, well. The future lies this way.</i></p><p>Toshi 
came up to her, with a suspicious look on his narrow face. "Hello, strange 
woman."</p><p>"Hello yourself, Tosh. I've a favor to ask of you."</p><p>His eyes shifted a 
bit, but in the end he looked down, with a sigh. "You saved my life, strange woman. I will 
do as you ask."</p><p>"This isn't a dangerous one. And I'll pay you for your 
time."</p><p>Toshi beamed. "Anything you ask!" he said emphatically.</p><p>Sei answered this 
lightning change of attitude with her crookedest grin. "I and my friends had a violent 
meeting last night, Toshi. With ruffians. Wise guys. Thieves, masterless men. Possibly 
friends of yours."</p><p>Toshi shrugged. "Anything is possible."</p><p>"There was a 
conversation among swords. One of them was wounded. The other two carried him off. I'll 
describe them for you." She did so.</p><p>Toshi nodded when she was done. "This one who 
jumped back, with the headband and the pretty robes -- sounds interesting."</p><p>"Yes, 
doesn't he? Not the sort you'd ordinarily meet in a situation like that. The robes, and his 
shyness when it came to swordsmanship, lead me to suspect that he may have come from --" she 
lowered her voice -- "the northernmost ward."</p><p>Toshi definitely looked interested now. 
"Very unusual. Strange woman brings strange news."</p><p>"I'm like that, or so I'm told," 
Sei said. "Here's walk-around money, with an advance." She offered him a smallish necklace 
of coins.</p><p>Toshi grunted with displeasure at the sight of them.</p><p>Sei sighed. "You 
can exchange them for rice at the usual rate and in the usual place, Toshi, you know that," 
she said impatiently. "Really, you Japanese need to get over your aversion to coined 
money."</p><p>"You gaijin need to get over your aversion to good honest rice," Toshi said 
resentfully.</p><p>"Rice is decent fare," Sei said grudgingly, "though I prefer potatoes, 
but even I have never used potatoes as money. Rice doesn't keep indefinitely, and it'd be 
devilish wonky, hauling this much rice with me everywhere I went."</p><p>Toshi gave the 
coins another look. "How much rice is that?"</p><p>"About five kin."</p><p>His lips moved a 
little. "Good enough," he said. He accepted the necklace.</p><p>"I want you to discover what 
you can about these men. And I don't want them to rumble they're being traced at all. I want 
you to be the merest shadow. Less even than a shadow."</p><p>Toshi nodded, and smiled. 
"You've come to the right Toshi for that," he said. "I'm just about invisible." Then he 
looked a bit morose. "Though there was one person who spotted me, once."</p><p>Sei nodded. 
"I know that, Toshi. But don't worry. I promised you I wouldn't tell, 
remember?..."</p><p>--</p><p>Yumi was naked, wet, embarrassed, confused, and in 
love.</p><p>She was finding life no less difficult than she'd found it yesterday, but much 
more complicated.</p><p>The naked and wet part was easy enough to understand; she'd removed 
her clothing and hot water had been poured over her. This, in turn, led to embarrassment. 
The confusion lay in the fact that she couldn't feel just one way about anything that was 
happening to her; she couldn't be only embarrassed or only happy, only wretched or only 
joyful: she was naked, wet, filthy, and vulnerable, in front of many strangers, and in front 
of the object of her love:</p><p>Sachiko-sama.</p><p>Why this great lady wanted Yumi around, 
Yumi still didn't know. Here was another source of confusion: she wanted to know why, and in 
fact she wanted to know everything about her Mistress, the Dark Lady, the most beautiful, 
powerful, clever, mysterious woman in the world. She could not rest until she knew 
everything, until she had cloaked herself in Sachiko-sama, or Sachiko-sama in herself, until 
she had become one with Sachiko-sama, or with all of the world that Sachiko-sama touched or 
cared for. On the other hand, she thought she might never know why, that the divine glory 
that was Sachiko-sama might not be for one such as she to understand, and the wisest course 
might simply be to enjoy her proximity with Sachiko-sama while it lasted, for it couldn't 
last long.</p><p>Sachiko-sama was also naked and wet -- though her wetness was just from the 
air in the bathhouse, as she had not doused herself yet -- and this had added in great 
measure to Yumi's confusion and distraction. Having Sachiko-sama's naked form in her vision 
-- long, long black hair; deep blue eyes; pale, creamy skin -- filled her with vertigo, with 
a strong feeling that there was something she should do, and the strong feeling that if she 
figured out what that something was, and did it, she would be destroyed.</p><p>It was easier 
now that Sachiko-sama was behind Yumi, and Yumi couldn't see her. Sachiko-sama was scrubbing 
Yumi's back. This had confused and upset Yumi at first -- Sachiko-sama's beautiful slender 
white hands and long fingers were surely made for the noblest of deeds -- to call forth fire 
against her enemies, and to heal her friends with their good, bright magic, as Yumi had 
seen: not to scrub Yumi's ordinary back. But when Yumi had hinted at this, Sachiko-sama had 
said she was being silly again. "You can't very well scrub your own back. And I'm certainly 
not going to let anyone else do it. Oh, Rei-san or Yoshino-chan, perhaps, but they're not 
here."</p><p>"Not Satou-sama?"</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous, Yumi." Sharp.</p><p>"Sorry, 
Mistress." Downcast.</p><p>"And don't be sorry either." Brisk, cheerful.</p><p>There was 
another thing. The unanimous opinion of everyone Yumi spoke to, including other tramps, was 
that Yumi was stupid and worthless. So now she was in the presence of this rarefied being, 
the one person she'd met who really made her feel stupid and worthless, and Sachiko-sama 
didn't seem to think of her that way at all. Just told her not to be silly when she raised 
the subject.</p><p>Sachiko-sama was complicated, but she seemed to like Yumi. Heaven might 
know why, but Yumi didn't.</p><p>But it seemed as if Yumi could never open her mouth without 
saying something that sounded foolish to herself, at least. So she had tried to spend this 
morning in a quiet, mortified, bashful state...</p><p>...which Sachiko-sama would not let 
her stay in. Sachiko-sama demanded a response, always.</p><p>Yumi just went on scrubbing all 
the parts of herself she could reach, and tried not to think about Sachiko-sama's hands 
scrubbing her back, and how nice they felt. She looked about her as she scrubbed, at the 
other people scrubbing themselves, and soaking in the two large, squarish stone tubs. The 
floor of the bath house was of earth. On this chilly morning in early spring, the bath house 
was warm, heated as it was by two large iron cauldrons near the far eastern wall in which 
bathwater steamed. High above the cauldrons was the gabled roof, with the morning sun 
peeking between short wooden pillars, catching and making brilliant the moisture in the air, 
and throwing dark shadows behind the bathers, and behind the partitions and alcoves which 
had been placed here and there for modesty's sake.</p><p>It was truly early spring, in 
Yumi's heart. All had been winter before this, and winter had been wearying and terrifying, 
an endless quest for warm places, which were often begrudged her by their warm and well-fed 
owners, and nights when she was sure she wouldn't see the morning, trudging along in search 
of a friendly fire, her rag-wrapped feet kicking now and then at the corpse of a bird, 
frozen in mid-flight. In this moist, life-giving warmth, it was like an ill dream. Now the 
weather was warmer and she'd found this unexpected joy, and almost felt like a child again, 
as she was washed by kind hands...</p><p>...and as she was thinking this, the picture before 
her, of people bathing and sun and the pillars -- especially the pillars, one of them had a 
knot, and big splinters coming off it so that just looking at it made her hand twitch -- was 
all so familiar to her that it seemed to her for a moment that she was in the bathhouse near 
where she'd grown up, in the spring before the long winter. She knew suddenly the truth of 
the old springtime...</p><p>The truth was there in her head. And it was unbearable. And then 
it was gone again, and she was scrubbing harder, her hands instinctively knowing that they 
had to distract her from what had just happened.</p><p>"Is something wrong?" said 
Sachiko-sama's unwontedly gentle, dreamy voice, from very near the nape of Yumi's neck. Yumi 
jumped a little, and scrubbed herself even harder with the loofah. "No! Nothing, Mistress." 
She hunted around for something else to say, fast. "I'm sorry I'm so filthy 
--"</p><p>"Nonsense, Yumi." Sachiko-sama sounded a bit more alert. "Look around you. Some of 
these people have been away from a bath for months. Do you see that old man? I'm sure his 
skin isn't really that color. And he's not the worst I've ever seen. You've nothing to be 
ashamed of."</p><p>"Mmm," Yumi mmmed, not convinced.</p><p>Sachiko-sama chuckled warmly. 
"Starting on your hair now, Yumi."</p><p>Her hair was a horrible, tangled mess, Yumi knew. 
Sachiko-sama slowly and carefully unsnarled it. She was doing her best not to hurt Yumi. The 
occasional whimper escaped between her clamped lips, but Yumi regarded this as a test. She 
had to show Sachiko-sama she could be stern if she needed to. Sachiko-sama was strong. Yumi 
could never be that strong, but she wanted to be as strong as she could.</p><p>And she never 
budged.</p><p>And gradually it ceased to be an ordeal and became, as the back-scrubbing had 
been, pleasant and unnerving all at once. Sachiko-sama's fingers ran through Yumi's hair. 
They stopped, and Sachiko rinsed, and the sheer pleasure of feeling all that muck just fall 
away filled Yumi with a tingling warmth. Yumi turned her face up for the last of it, closing 
her eyes, perhaps reveling a bit. When she opened them, there was Sachiko-sama's face above 
her, upside down, smiling, almost laughing. And then Sachiko-sama began to soap her hair for 
the second time. The suds were thicker now, and her hair squeaked a little under them. Yumi 
felt as if she were floating.</p><p>"The lice," Yumi said, without realizing she was 
speaking.</p><p>"I'm feeling them now," Sachiko-sama said. "They were trying to hide from me 
before." There was that smile in her voice. Yumi could feel Sachiko's hands, and lice 
squirming under the hands, in the soap.</p><p>Sachiko-sama sang:</p><p>The many hells surely 
wait<br>For such vermin as yourselves -<br>Or at least, the cold earth.</p><p>And... against 
the coldness of the last line, the warmth in Yumi's body surged again. There was also the 
strong impression that she could feel everything around her -- the bare wood stool she sat 
on, the packed dirt under her feet, banks and tendrils of steam in the moist air, and 
Sachiko-sama behind her -- especially Sachiko-sama. They were two warmths, almost lost in 
the greater warmth of the bathhouse, they shone with warmth, Sachiko with her own and Yumi 
with the warmth Sachiko had poured into her, and Yumi's limbs felt wonderfully loose and 
easy... The lice had stopped squirming. "The lice, Mistress?..."</p><p>"They're dead. Their 
little bodies tumble off you even now."</p><p>And Sachiko-sama rinsed Yumi's hair 
again.</p><p>At the end of it all, at a touch on her shoulder from Sachiko-sama, Yumi turned 
on the stool to face her, and Sachiko-sama put a hand on each of Yumi's shoulders. "You are 
clean. Is it agreeable to you?"</p><p>"Yes, Mistress," Yumi said.</p><p>"Please wait here. 
My bath won't take as long, but I do need one. But I have to get more water from the 
concierge."</p><p>And Sachiko wrapped herself in her towel again and walked toward the surly 
man who was tending the fires under the cauldrons.</p><p>Yumi stood, and walked around a 
little. The strange feeling she'd had earlier had passed completely, and all she was left 
with was a sense of niggling familiarity, a sense that she'd seen this place before. But 
really, it was just an enormous room, and she supposed that one bathhouse must be very like 
another, and she had seldom been allowed inside any of them, at least as far back 
as...</p><p>...as she could...</p><p>(An eye observed her, to her unknowledge. A careful, 
clever eye which took in her slenderness, her wetness, her sun-browned limbs and head 
against the paleness of the rest of her, her awkward grace, her newly-born quality, and this 
eye much liked what it saw. The owner of the eye winked it at no-one, and moved.)</p><p>None 
of the alcoves was very large, it seemed to Yumi, and yet this one, here, looked 
interesting, as if an altar had been set up in it at one time: an old cracked table, a 
dulled vase with a shiny violet inside showing at the lip, and a place that looked as if an 
image had hung there --</p><p>A dark shadow enveloped her. There was a man between her and 
the sunshiny pillars at the eastern end. A tall man with an earring and a broad, 
shiny-toothed grin. He looked like a river-demon. "Funny, that this alcove interests you," 
he said, taking her elbow. "It has a most curious history! This place in dark times was once 
a shrine to foreign gods -- demons in all sooth -- and I am a demon, from a long line of 
river demons worshipped here. This is my family altar..."</p><p>This silly man was no demon. 
Yumi knew demons. But he was strong. As she was urged along toward the altar, as she and the 
river-demon were both eclipsed by the darker shadow of the bamboo partition, Yumi tried to 
pull her elbow free. The man's grip tightened.</p><p>--</p><p>The concierge, Yukito-san, was 
in a grumpy mood. "You don't usually ask for more water, Ogasawara-san."</p><p>"Well, no. 
But today I have a companion."</p><p>"I saw. Has she paid her temple fee?"</p><p>"No. She is 
my servant, and I've only just engaged her. She has no money."</p><p>"So when will she pay 
her fee?"</p><p>"I will pay it for her, as soon as you tell me what amount the temple will 
charge her, and as soon as I can get my clothing and valuables back from you. For right now, 
may I just have the water? I've bathed her, you see, and there is no water left. My own bath 
is still to do. You would oblige me extremely, Yukito-san."</p><p>Yukito-san stared at her a 
moment longer, his arms still folded over his belly. Then he rose, and held his hand out for 
her bucket.</p><p>When he had filled it, he said, "No charge, this time. But see 
Keita-'nii-san before she bathes here again, please."</p><p>"I certainly will. I am grateful 
for your generosity, Yukito-san."</p><p>Sachiko accepted her water with a small bow, and 
walked back --</p><p>-- and Yumi was not where she'd left her. Her towel lay folded on the 
stool where she'd left it.</p><p>Sachiko set the water down by it, cursing herself for a 
fool. <i>Take my eye off her for five seconds --</i> She looked around --</p><p>Ah, there 
was the alcove there, with the old altar in it, and she could hear familiar sounds of 
distress coming from it. She rounded the corner as quickly as she could.</p><p>There was a 
man. A big man. A big man filthy with mud as if he'd been wading up to the neck in a river. 
One of his arms was covered with blue and pink tattoos. He wore earrings. His thing was 
flopping around as he tried to get Yumi up against the altar. Yumi was struggling, yelping, 
"Wait! Hey, wait! Please, stop! No --" And he was laughing, grabbing her arms, laughing 
again when they slipped out of his grip, getting another grip, he was touching Yumi, and his 
thing was --</p><p>"Let her go," Sachiko said.</p><p>He turned to look at her. "Bite me --" 
he drawled, and stopped. He seemed to recognize her.</p><p>"Let her go. Right away. Or I 
<i>will</i> bite you."</p><p>"Now, wait a minute," he said. "If she comes here -- I mean, 
everyone knows it's mixed bathing, here --"</p><p>He had maintained his grip on one of 
Yumi's shoulders, but somehow Yumi slipped out of it, and as soon as she had, he slipped, as 
though he'd stepped on a piece of rotten fruit, and was flying headlong.</p><p>Yumi 
squeaked, and fitted herself into the corner.</p><p><i>I have to talk her out of her 
obsession with corners,</i> Sachiko thought absently. But her eyes, and most of her 
attention, were on her prey. He looked a rough, dangerous sort of man, but he was currently 
lying prone and trembling, staring at Sachiko. She stared back, considering the rich variety 
of options open to her. <i>"Bite me," did he say? Should I give him something to bite on? 
Hard enough to break his teeth, perhaps?...</i></p><p><i>Yumi is here. Yumi is 
watching.</i></p><p>Sachiko took a deep breath, and spoke slowly, with carefully contrived 
mildness. "For the future: if a sorceress tells you to do something 'right away,' it is 
excellent policy to comply."</p><p>"I didn't --" he said, and stopped. He was grimacing and 
clutching his thing. There was a light smear of blood on one hand. He seemed to have landed 
badly.</p><p>"Is there anything you wish to say?" she asked him.</p><p>He was looking at her 
with his mouth open.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>He cried out and began to scratch 
himself down there.</p><p>"If you don't want anything worse than an itch," she said, "then 
take yourself off. And if you interfere with a sorceress again it'll be the worse for 
you."</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Where there had been no-one a few moments ago, some bathers 
-- a rather attractive young woman, a woman of matriarchal years and weight with some grey 
in her hair, a skinny young man -- were all staring, at Sachiko, and at the towelless Yumi. 
The young man's jaw was hanging free. Sachiko fought back the deep red rage she was feeling, 
and gave them a calm, gentle look. They turned back to what they were doing, almost with one 
motion.</p><p>And she turned at last to Yumi. "Are you all right?" she asked 
anxiously.</p><p>Before the question was all the way out of her mouth, however, Yumi had 
flung herself forward and wrapped herself around her. She was wet, cold, and trembling in 
Sachiko's arms.</p><p>Sachiko might have said that a properly respectful servant did not 
embrace her mistress, certainly not without permission, but Yumi was trembling too badly for 
her to say anything of the kind, and anyway, there was something... nice... about the 
feeling. She felt an urge to fling the girl away -- she was never this close, this intimate 
with anybody -- but there was a more powerful urge she hadn't recognized until now, which, 
looking back on her actions, she supposed must have been with her since she had first looked 
into a pair of large, teary, frightened eyes last night: the deep, dark, primal urge to... 
to hold this girl, and protect her, and, now and then... comb her hair and tell her how cute 
she was. The urge was much more noticeable now that the girl was clean and therefore more 
obviously cute.</p><p>And so, she relaxed, and held Yumi closer. The girl's utter 
vulnerability touched her -- a girl who had until recently lacked any protection whatever. 
How was she possible?</p><p>Yumi's trembling had calmed considerably by the time Sachiko had 
fully accepted this new fact: she had found much, much more than a famula. "Better, now?" 
Sachiko said.</p><p>Yumi reluctantly put herself away from Sachiko, or at least at arm's 
length. She was blushing. "I am sorry, Mistress -- I shouldn't --" she was stopped by one 
Sachiko hand on her cheek, and by a soft Sachiko kiss on her forehead.</p><p>"Please don't 
apologize," Sachiko said. "It was stupid of me to leave you alone. What happened was my 
fault. It is mixed bathing, you see, as that worm said. I have the reputation of being a 
sorceress, so I'm pretty much immune to such attacks, and I didn't stop to think that my 
reputation might not protect you if I left you alone. That shouldn't happen again as long as 
we stay together."</p><p>"All right," Yumi said, looking a little dazed. "But...should I not 
have..."</p><p>Sachiko looked at Yumi, a bit puzzled, then thought: <i>She's worried about 
hugging me without permission.</i> She drew Yumi into her embrace of her own accord, this 
time. "You will learn how to behave properly around me, and not to hug me without warning, 
and to observe other important points of etiquette -- in public," Sachiko said into one pink 
ear. "I will be patient with you. When we are in private, however, I wouldn't have you any 
other way than as you are. All right?"</p><p>"Yes, Mistress," Yumi said. They broke the hug, 
and there was that gaze again: adoration. Sachiko basked in it for a moment, and wondered 
what on earth to do about it.</p><p>"Good. Now, would you do something for 
me?"</p><p>"Anything, Mistress!"</p><p>"Please wash my back?"</p><p>Yumi smiled happily. 
"Yes, Mistress!"</p><p>--</p><p>Tsujimoto no Fujito, while an intelligent man, and skilled 
by now in certain aspects of underworld life, was not very good at following 
people.</p><p>Fortunately, it was a busy day in the Great Eastern Market, and he'd managed 
to pick up his quarry very early, just as they were leaving the Mountain Lily Inn to go to 
the temple baths. There were enough people, and therefore enough noise, movement, 
distraction generally, that he could stay fairly close to them without much chance of their 
noticing.</p><p>His one worry, since this market was often frequented by palace servants, 
was the possibility of being recognised by someone who knew him from his previous existence. 
In situations like this he would take Ichiki-san's advice: "Wear drab clothes, don't powder 
your face, and that sissy little lacquered hat of yours is just about the worst thing 
imaginable; it's like wrapping a banner around your head reading FUGITIVE NOBLEMAN HERE." 
This was difficult advice for Tsujimoto no Fujito to follow; he didn't feel like himself 
when he wasn't properly dressed and coiffed. But Ichiki-san had made him see, with much 
wheedling and coaxing, that his habitual raiment was now an aid to identification and, even 
with the imperial guards and the city constabulary in the sorry state they were in, a danger 
not only to himself but to his compatriots.</p><p>He was tired. He was normally asleep 
around this time, but he'd found it advisable to keep clear of Shinji-kun for the moment. 
Shinji-kun had always looked up to Ichiki-san as an elder brother, and now Ichiki-san lay 
mortally wounded, and it was, after all, after a fashion, as who should say... Tsuji's 
fault. Rather. Shinji-kun had made no open accusation, but since the rumpus several hours 
earlier, he had taken to looking at Tsujimoto with an unnerving light in his eyes, such that 
Tsujimoto thought it might be the gravest folly to sleep in Shinji-kun's presence.</p><p>And 
after all, if he was to have any hope of gaining his prize, he needed intelligence. He had 
thought of attempting a desperate ingress to the Ogasawara's rooms while she was out, but 
was held back by Ichiki and Shinji's former warnings about sorceresses, and the fact that at 
least two of the sorceresses with whom the Ogasawara cohabited had not yet stirred and, 
should he chance to disturb them...</p><p>No. With his lieutenants effectively out of the 
game, he needed someone else to take his risks for him.</p><p>He wouldn't have recognised 
the beggar-girl if she hadn't been clinging to the Ogasawara sorceress's arm when they came 
out of the temple bath. The girl was unwontedly clean and had turned out to be surprisingly 
comely, if a bit scrawny, under all that filth. It astonished him, after hearing that scream 
in the night, that she was alive at all, but what had startled and upset him more than 
anything was that his lucky urchin, his filthy little thief, was on such good terms with the 
woman he had set her on to rob only hours before. She stayed close to the Ogasawara at all 
times, often looking up at her worshipfully -- and the Ogasawara, for her part, though calm 
of visage -- stern, at times -- seemed solicitous and protective of the little thief to a 
startling degree. This was not the behavior of a person who was about to call a constable. 
To Tsujimoto no Fujito, this was both good news and bad rolled into one unpredictable 
package.</p><p>Indeed, as their peregrinations through the noise and confusion of the 
Eastern Market continued, it became clear that the Ogasawara was outfitting the girl, buying 
her clothes and shoes and ladies' necessaries of various description. Had she engaged the 
girl as a servant?... It didn't quite feel that way. Tsujimoto was no expert in these 
matters, but it seemed more... They were currently choosing robes and tunics in a partially 
enclosed stall, dull grey wood on the outside, vibrant passionate color within... He found a 
side of the stall that was close to another stall, and relatively quiet, and a crack between 
two boards to peer through. Just a snatch of overheard conversation might tell him 
much.</p><p>His little between-the-wood slice happened to include his little thief and 
no-one else. She was wearing robes far too grand for her, and seemed to find the floor 
wildly interesting.</p><p>"Mistress, this fits well enough."</p><p>"It does. It is only... I 
am irked, Yumi." That was the Ogasawara, no doubt. A well-modulated, cultured voice. "The 
best greens are not available to you because that is the official colour of the sixth rank 
of the palace hierarchy. This green and this violet together do make a pretty enough show. I 
was just hoping to do better for you, that's all. Have you any other greens, 
friend?"</p><p>Tsujimoto couldn't see the shopkeeper, but heard him grumble a bit. Some 
hanging robes wavered and jounced as if someone had gone behind them.</p><p>Tsujimoto's 
lucky thief hung her head and blushed. She seemed to have a surprisingly delicate complexion 
for a beggar. "Mistress -- plain grey would be good enough for me. Less expensive too. You 
shouldn't..." She seemed unable to finish the thought.</p><p>And then the Ogasawara was 
right in front of her. Her eyes were flashing in an agreeable way. Tsujimoto thought briefly 
what a pity it was that such a magnificent creature -- and with such a pedigree! -- should 
abandon society, tie back her hair, and open herself to such defilement as the sorceresses 
did.</p><p>"Yumi, what did I tell you?..."</p><p>"That I shouldn't hate myself so much for 
being mere filth, Mistress."</p><p>"Those were not the words I used, Yumi."</p><p>"No, 
Mistress. I'm as good as anybody in the Guild, Mistress."</p><p>"Much better, 
Yumi."</p><p>So the Ogasawara was teaching his thief strange and irreligious ideas. Most 
curious. Tsujimoto saw that he would have to move fast if he wanted to reassert his dominion 
over the girl.</p><p>"You must learn to value yourself properly, Yumi," the sorceress went 
on. "I won't have an imouto who doesn't have a proper sense of her own station."</p><p>The 
girl ducked her head as if she'd been slapped.</p><p>The Ogasawara shook her head very 
slightly. "Come, Yumi. This is no way to be. Look! Take these off..." She began undressing 
the girl, who went completely pink and let out a strange squeal a bit like a baby dragon, 
but did not resist. "You'll try on this puce one instead, while we're waiting for the 
onee-san to come back. With perhaps the moss green, with the autumnal 
motif..."</p><p>"Mistress -- please --"</p><p>"Don't squirm so, Yumi. What <i>is</i> the 
matter?"</p><p>"I... I itch, Mistress."</p><p>Those astonishing blue eyes regarded the 
beggar girl. "Was it the bath?"</p><p>"I think so, Mistress." The beggar girl was looking at 
the floor.</p><p>The Ogasawara regarded the beggar girl for another moment, and then wrapped 
her arms around her, pulling her near. The beggar girl made another squeaking sound, but did 
not resist.</p><p>The Ogasawara said:</p><p>Little fox with no fleas,<br>With all filth 
banished:<br>Be at peace with your skin.</p><p><i>Was that supposed to be a poem?</i> Tsuji 
thought, incredulous. <i>She's rubbish.</i></p><p>"Better?" said the Ogasawara.</p><p>"Yes," 
said the beggar girl. She was still blushing, but seemed considerably more relaxed. She just 
stood in her mistress's embrace, looking very comfortable, and looking up at her. "You'll 
use your magic even just to make an itch go away?"</p><p>"If I can give an itch to a river 
demon, I can take one away from my little fox," the Ogasawara said. Fondly.</p><p>"You 
didn't give him a poem, Mistress."</p><p>"He didn't merit one."</p><p>They just stood like 
that a moment longer, and then the Ogasawara released the girl, gently, perhaps a bit 
awkwardly. Then she continued to undress her. Soon the pink-cheeked beggar girl was quite 
unclothed, but the Ogasawara was in the way, and Tsujimoto couldn't quite see -- there was 
something odd about her, aside from the scrawniness, something --</p><p>"Excuse 
me."</p><p>Tsujimoto looked up quickly. There was the shopkeeper, hands on his hips -- oh, 
er, on her hips -- giving him a dispassionate look.</p><p>Caught. In truth, Tsujimoto was an 
old hand at peeping at women while they dressed, since well before he had perforce joined 
the underworld. But the scrawny little tramp in there was not really to his taste, and he 
hadn't thought of what he was doing in those terms at all. "I, er, um," he said 
intelligently, his hands fondling one another in what he hoped was an apologetic 
fashion.</p><p>The woman struck him quite hard over the right ear, and he went 
down.</p><p>He writhed and scrabbled a bit in the dust, clutching his head. She'd cupped her 
hand, and his ear felt as if a whole room had been shoved suddenly inside it, an enormous 
space between him and the world of his right side, with breakers coming up to its terrace, 
and a demented bird singing a single high note in the eaves.</p><p>He heard through the 
waves and the sick-sweet tone the woman saying, "If you're here when I come back, I'll have 
a board with some nails in it." And then he heard her retreating footsteps.</p><p>Tsujimoto 
stood, with some effort. Time to go. Damned women. Women were supposed to be gentle, 
submissive, self-effacing. They weren't supposed to steal your thief from you, they weren't 
supposed to use swords on your henchmen. They certainly weren't supposed to hit you unfairly 
like that. Still, it probably was for the best. If she hadn't dismissed him as a nasty 
little voyeur, she might have thought it necessary to draw the Ogasawara's attention to him, 
and that might well have been fatal. He got back out into the main thoroughfare and managed, 
in spite of the noise, and the people dashing to and fro and stepping on his feet, and the 
vibrating gong in his middle ear, to orient himself as to the compass points. He headed 
west, through the throng.</p><p>Things had become desperate. If the object was to be 
surrounded at all times by sorceresses, and he couldn't even handle unarmed combat with an 
irate clothier, then he definitely needed some help. But his usual help was out of 
commission -- well, one-half out of commission. But Shinji-kun would likely be unwilling to 
accept his leadership while his aniki lay wounded, perhaps dying.</p><p><i>I'm an aniki 
too,</i> he thought to himself, as he hustled along Seventh Street toward Red Bird Avenue. 
<i>Yes.</i> The great willows that lined the avenue waved and rustled in the spring wind. He 
would turn right when he reached them, and go north, and he knew the door to knock upon. He 
had hoped to avoid this necessity, but the situation was desperate. It was time to call in 
some favors.</p><p>--</p><p>The sorceress Mizuno Youko looked critically at her imouto's new 
famula. The girl had curtsied properly and now stood submissive, awaiting approval. Her 
shoulder-length hair, light brown and shiny, was pulled back into a barrette, and she wore a 
white tunic going to mid-thigh, and a violet robe. Her shoes were of black lacquered wood, 
quite new, and her dainty toenails were painted a seashell pink. She appeared to have been 
dressed and shod and coiffed at considerably greater expense than famulae usually were. But, 
unusual as that was, it was really up to Sachiko how she dressed her famula and Youko had 
nothing to say about it. Officially.</p><p>She sneaked a quick glance at Sachiko. Rather 
than looking at Youko, sternly awaiting her judgment (and hopefully approval) as she usually 
did, she was looking at Yumi, with a fond little smile and dreaming eyes.</p><p><i>Oh, 
dear.</i></p><p>Youko quizzed the girl as to her duties.</p><p>"It is my duty to serve my 
Mistress, standing at her side, supporting her silently," Yumi said. "It is my duty to fetch 
things my Mistress asks for, and to serve her tea when she requires it. Mistress says she 
will teach me how to make tea tonight. When my Mistress is abroad, it is my duty to keep her 
camp against intruders, using whatever magics or weapons she has entrusted to me, or my bare 
fists if she has entrusted me nothing. Mistress adds that she would be unlikely to leave me 
alone without a weapon anyway, but says that isn't official doctrine." Yumi stumbled a bit 
over "official doctrine." "When my Mistress is in town, it is my duty to keep her door 
against strangers, and tell them Mistress is not at home, if she does not wish to be home to 
them. This would be a lie, but I would tell it if Mistress asked me to. Mistress adds, 
though this isn't official doctrine either, that it is Mistress's duty to take care of me, 
and teach me skills that will be useful to me and others, and take me into her lap now and 
then, and comb my hair, and tell me stories --"</p><p>"That's fine, Yumi," Sachiko said, 
smiling, apparently unembarrassed.</p><p>"Yes, Mistress," Yumi said, and went silent 
again.</p><p>The girl had been well-catechized in her duties. Somewhat over-catechized, 
perhaps.</p><p>"Well, congratulations, Sachiko," Youko said at last, as she turned to her 
writing-table.</p><p>"Mmm?" Sachiko said. She was still looking at Yumi, who was now looking 
at her. The look that they were sharing was not a mistress-famula look.</p><p><i>Oh, 
dear.</i> "Congratulations on your find," Youko went on. "You have capitalized on it 
quickly. It looks as if you'll be joining us on the Questioning after all, barring any 
unforeseen complications."</p><p>"Will you like to go on a Questioning, Yumi?" Sachiko asked 
gently.</p><p>"Yes, Mistress. What's a Questioning?" Yumi said adorably.</p><p>"I'll tell 
you all about it later," Sachiko said, beaming.</p><p><i>Oh dear oh dear oh dear.</i> Mizuno 
Youko sighed. "Yumi, do you like my garden?"</p><p>Yumi looked out at the lush interior 
garden. "It's beautiful, Mizuno-sama."</p><p>"I should like a private word or two with your 
mistress. Would you mind going out into the garden for a few minutes?"</p><p>"...Leave 
Mistress?" The girl seemed flummoxed, mystified, as if she were being asked to take wing, or 
live underwater with the fish.</p><p>"Only for a few minutes," Youko said with a patient 
smile. "You'll be right out there and your mistress will be able to see you. In case she has 
difficulty breathing."</p><p>Still, the girl was confused. She looked at Sachiko. Sachiko 
smiled happily. "I want you to look at the garden, Yumi. I love the garden. It is the only 
garden of its kind in all Nihon. Later perhaps I can come and look at it with you, and you 
can tell me all about what you've seen."</p><p>Yumi nodded and smiled. "Very well, 
Mistress." She turned back to Youko. "I will go, Mizuno-sama." She looked again at Sachiko, 
seemed about to do something, to start some movement; but, seeming to think better of it, 
made a simple bow, turned, and went out the open panel into the garden.</p><p>"Quite a find, 
Sachiko," Youko said again, giving her imouto a very sharp look.</p><p>"Isn't she?" said 
Sachiko. She looked happier than Youko had ever seen her, the strumpet. She seemed unable to 
take her eyes off the girl who was now walking slowly through the garden, taking care not to 
touch anything, but showing great interest in everything. "This morning, I bathed her, and 
took her shopping for clothes. This afternoon, I taught her basic deportment. Then I brought 
her to you. She learns very quickly, and from no apparent motivation other than to please 
me. She makes a mistake now and then, but one gentle reminder -- often no more than a look 
or a sigh -- and she'll correct it herself. I have not had to be harsh with her once, which 
is just as well, because I couldn't bear it."</p><p>"You are infatuated with your servant, 
Sachiko," Youko said bluntly.</p><p>Sachiko glared at Youko. "Infatuated? Nonsense! I am 
merely very fond of the ground on which she walks."</p><p>"Sachikoooo! Old bean bun! That 
was almost a joke!" said Sei, coming out from behind a screen.</p><p>--</p><p>"Please do not 
call me an old bean bun," said Sachiko sadly. "And good afternoon, Sei-san. And, damn you 
for an infernal pest, what are you doing here?"</p><p>"Never you mind," Sei-san said 
ominously. "I'm just looking after everyone's best interest, as I am wont to do. What do you 
think, Youko?" Sei-san and Youko-sama were facing off. They looked almost adversarial, but 
Sachiko knew they were old friends.</p><p>"I think you were right to discuss the matter with 
me, Sei. Sachiko, Sei worries that you may be being hoodwinked by this girl."</p><p>"Oh, I 
think Sei is wrong about that," Sachiko said, in a gently chiding tone.</p><p>Sei-san shook 
her head. "Love, you see," she said to Youko-sama. "Simple child of nature that she is, 
she's never felt it before, and it's making a complete fool of her." She faced Sachiko 
grimly. "Talking turkey here now, young pestilence. Really. Seriously. What do you know 
about this girl?"</p><p>"Not much," Sachiko said. "She says she has no family name, or 
rather, when I pressed her on that, that she couldn't remember it. She's been living on the 
streets, and Sei-san will tell you, Youko-sama, how filthy she was when she turned up last 
night. Bathed and properly dressed, she's like a different person. Teaching her deportment, 
I seemed not to be teaching her so much as reminding her of things she'd known once, but 
forgotten. Everything about her suggests that she has been gently reared. Her hands are 
soft, which tells of a childhood spent among the gentry, or one of the greater merchant or 
serving families at least. And a filthy horrid disgusting man attempted to rape her at the 
baths, and she seemed utterly defenseless, and upset, and astonished that this was happening 
to her -- and yet, how has she lived on the street as long as she seems to have done, 
without having been thoroughly raped already?"</p><p>Sei-san, for once, was bemused instead 
of bemuser -- Sachiko felt a quick little snake of triumph coiling in her belly. But Sei-san 
recovered quickly. "So...you do see that there is something uncanny about her?"</p><p>"There 
are many things uncanny about her, Sei-san," Sachiko said, in a tone of mindless wonder, 
gazing out at her treasure, who appeared to be attempting conversation with a cat. The cat, 
white with one black paw and with the corner of its right ear missing, seemed to be 
agreeable to her overtures, and started rubbing itself against her leg as she stroked its 
head.</p><p>"And yet...you don't think she's deceiving you?"</p><p>Sachiko looked around, 
with the faintly annoyed air of one importuned out of a pleasant trance. "Mmm? No. No, 
Sei-san, I don't think she has been deceiving me. I don't know just what is going on. I do 
intend to find out."</p><p>"You let her sleep in your room last night," Youko-sama said 
sternly.</p><p>"Yes. And she will sleep in my room tonight, too, and every other 
night."</p><p>"Even though you are meant to be safeguarding a certain important 
object?"</p><p>Sachiko sighed, and opened her pouch. "I thought you would bring this up, and 
so I brought it with me." She withdrew from the pouch a thing that changed the white of her 
hand to gold. "Here it is. If you don't trust me, or Yumi, you may by all means lodge it 
with someone else, and I will bear you no ill-will whatever."</p><p>"Sachiko, please put it 
back. I chose you to bear it for many reasons -- not the least of which is that it looks 
best, with you. I mean for you to present it to her this year, you know."</p><p>Sachiko put 
it back. "I do know. I know that who it is lodged with is an important decision. You did me 
an honor, placing it with me, and entrusted me with a grave responsibility. I knew that at 
the time, and I took that responsibility seriously."</p><p>Youko-sama looked sad. "And yet 
you took such a risk? After Sei warned you?"</p><p>"A calculated risk, perhaps. I had spent 
more time with her than Sei-san had, and felt fairly certain I could trust her. It was 
important to me at any rate not to visibly distrust her, though I took care to place a ward 
around the cabinet before I slept. And I did that, not because I thought there was danger to 
it, but because more than my own needs and wishes were at stake there. I awoke this morning, 
and Yumi still lay beside me. I checked the ward, and it had not been tampered with. Is it 
acceptable?"</p><p>Youko-sama turned slightly away. "I suppose it has to be, Sachiko. I will 
confess that you took all needful precautions. If the girl is what she seems to 
be."</p><p>Sachiko's gaze on her old teacher did not waver. "She is mysterious, yes. But I 
don't think she involves deception. Even if she does involve a deception, I don't think that 
she involves danger. If there is danger, I take full responsibility."</p><p>"But, Sachiko 
--" Youko-sama began.</p><p>"If I may?" Sachiko interrupted -- a remarkable departure from 
etiquette, for her. "What I will not do, under any circumstances, is turn my back on 
her."</p><p>Sei-san and Youko-sama both seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>Sachiko sighed. "I 
will grant you, intellectually, the possibility that she is not the person she seems to be. 
But for myself, I choose to believe in that person. Until she proves herself to be 
otherwise."</p><p>"And if she does?" Youko-sama asked.</p><p>"Then it will break my 
heart."</p><p>Youko-sama sighed. Sei-san seemed strangely upset, almost in 
tears.</p><p>"Talk to her for a few minutes," Sachiko said gently. "Try any trick or trap 
you can think of. See if you don't come to the same conclusion I did: not that she is hiding 
things, but that things are being hidden from her."</p><p>"Do you think she's been 
glamoured?" Youko-sama asked thoughtfully.</p><p>"I don't know. If she has been, I can find 
no trace of it. But you make it clear that you know what my level of expertise is, and what 
my qualifications are to make any such declaration, Mizuno-sama."</p><p>"I will see if 
Fujiwara-dono is available for a brief chat," said Youko-sama.</p><p>"I should hardly like 
to trouble Fujiwara-dono," Sachiko said.</p><p>"I would not, ordinarily," said Youko-sama, 
"and she may think me foolish for disturbing her over a trifle. But she is to lead the 
Questioning this year, and perhaps she would rather be bothered briefly now than seriously 
inconvenienced later."</p><p>Sachiko inclined her head. Youko-sama went out.</p><p>"You 
really are in love with her," Sei-san said.</p><p>--</p><p>Sachiko looked at Sei-san in 
wonder, and then out at Yumi in greater wonder still. Shimazu Yoshino-chan had joined her 
out there at some point, and the two of them were taking turns petting the cat and talking 
to one another. There was a lot of smiling and hands-over-mouths going on. "I hardly know 
what I feel yet, Sei-san. You are the expert on love --"</p><p>"When the wind is northerly 
and the wild geese have flown," Sei-san said. She stood beside Sachiko, looking out at the 
budding friendship in the garden.</p><p>"All I know is that I have met someone very 
important to me. More important than my family."</p><p>"But do you really buy the 
sweet-little-miss-needs-protecting schtick?" Sei-san was looking down a skeptical, Dionysian 
nose now at a calm, Apollonian Sachiko. "If she's really been living on the street for an 
extended period, she'd have to be very good at protecting herself, or at least putting 
herself beyond the reach of things she'd need protecting from."</p><p>"Yes," Sachiko said. 
"Like a minnow in a clear pool. You have an excellent point, Sei-san. But I counter that 
with her tears, last night, when she said she couldn't sleep with me because she had lice. 
Her grief, shame, humiliation, were very real. Those were not the tears of a street urchin 
who had never known a better life. But questions on just what sort of life she has led yield 
nothing substantive. And I'm almost positive she isn't holding back information. She simply 
doesn't remember."</p><p>"Did someone really try to rape her at the baths?"</p><p>"Yes," 
Sachiko said with some brusqueness. That was an unpleasant memory and she had no wish to
