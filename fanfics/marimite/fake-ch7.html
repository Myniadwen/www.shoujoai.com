<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had thought that her daily challenge had been and gone. Dealing with  a peptic ulcer lashing out at her by way of her esophagus had seemed  enough trouble for at least one twenty-four hour period to her,  though she’d never complain about it, and she wasn’t in any mood  to further strain herself in that hot parking lot, where the air was  thick enough to suffocate somebody who wasn’t used to it (though to  those who were, it seemed little more than one of those little  annoyances that never quite goes away—comparable perhaps to unkempt  sidewalks after a snowy day).  She was, in fact, tired. She wanted to  go on a drive, yes, but she wanted to relax, too.  Or at least not  have to strain herself again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That, it  seemed, was not in the cards quite yet, however, for their new  challenge approached them almost as soon as their decision had been  reached: How to fit every member of their group into Sei’s tiny  Volkswagen Beetle? None of them, as far as Sachiko knew, had anywhere  else to be, after all, and Yumi and Yoshino were willing to leave  none of them behind, even if only to wait for a ride. After all, what  good would such careless driving do if you had to confirm your every  turn with the driver behind you? She supposed that originally, none  of them had particularly thought about the size of Sei’s car as  being an issue—they had all expected that a car which was suitable  for joyriding would be able to fit any number of people, in only mild  discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It never  occurred to Sachiko that she was, perhaps, overthinking the entire  thing, the entire endeavor of <em>joyriding. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei was  the first to notice the problem, though it didn’t appear to be, to  her, problematic so much as one more source of amusement, as  everything else seemed to be to her (in Sachiko’s eye, anyway).  She said it in an offhand sort of way, as they all started to make  their way towards the car:  “If Yoshino is getting the front, I  suppose that means that the rest of you ought to be very comfortable  with each other, huh? It almost makes me want to let Rei drive.”  She said it with a lopsided, strangely charming smile.  A moment  later, still walking, she dug into her pocket and produced a small  key ring with a single key and a remote on it.  It was the latter  that she fiddled with for a moment, until something <em>blipped </em>not  far off.  A second time, and Sachiko’s eyes became drawn to the  car, and her mind became drawn to the problem:  Sei’s car was a  bug.  A beetle.  A tiny little car that probably couldn’t suit more  than four, in Sachiko’s mind, let alone seven. None of the others  commented on it for whatever reason—<em>whatever reason </em>being,  unbeknownst to Sachiko, that they had already spent one screaming,  gorge-rising, rubber-burning drive inside of it, cramped together,  and the thought of another didn’t seem too awful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  Sachiko, it seemed a deal-breaker. <em>How could we possibly fit that  many people inside such a small car? </em>It seemed almost like a  physical impossibility, the exclusive property of clowns and midgets  the world over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At this,  Yumi began to flush a bit, and Sachiko wondered a bit at her. Her  face was a bit reminiscent of how it was when she was deep in  thought, but there was something else to it this time—a wideness of  her eyes, an unusual straightness to her posture, so much so that it  seemed for a moment that Yumi might bend backwards.  “How…how do  you think we should double up?” she asked Sei. <em>Double up </em>bounced off of Sachiko’s eardrums in the way that a word in  another language might bounce off of a casual speaker’s ear, so she  didn’t think much on it—had she, she might have been  significantly less surprised that Yumi had asked Sei instead of  Yoshino, or Shimako, or even Sachiko herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  smiled back at Yumi and winked.  “I think that’s up to you kids  to decide. I’m just the chauffeur, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  whole thing was entirely unintelligible to Sachiko, who had grown up  riding in spacious sedans and limousines. <em>But why did she ask </em>Sei? <em>Sei, of all people. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  looked to Shimako, who only smiled, her expression entirely  unreadable; she looked to Rei, who shrugged a mite helplessly, with  an exasperation that only the old should have been able to feel with  the young. Finally, she looked at Sachiko, who smiled at her,  entirely baffled by this point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama,</em>”  she said, nearly tripping over her own tongue, “would you like  to…if it’s okay with you…I mean,” she stopped, and pulled in  a deep breath, drawing her hands towards her stomach, to clasp  directly over her belly-button—a trick Sachiko had taught her one  day before she had had to give a speech for the Yamayurikai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  you feel yourself losing your composure, take in one single deep  breath, </em>she’d said, <em>and stop whatever it was you were  saying.  To cover this, simply give a smile and do not respond to any  questions or murmurs from your audience—</em>and Yumi was, indeed,  smiling, and Sachiko had an idea that Yumi wouldn’t budge that  expression if Sei had declared her intent to marry her in that  instant—<em>and clasp your hands over your stomach. Like this, yes,  as though you were singing an opera.  Let your breath out, and then  begin speaking again, keeping your hands clasped firmly. Whenever you  feel unconfident, after that, simply tug at your hands rather than  engaging in a stutter or nervous habit, and remember: You have  ensnared your audience such that they were unable to budge you even  though you fell silent for a full ten seconds, with no reason.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had taught this to Yumi kindly, but in a voice that had seemed a bit  odd to her—her voice had actually been slightly lower as she spoke.   More like her mother’s. She thought that maybe it had just been a  symptom of a cold or some other such trivial nonsense at the time.  Now, perhaps, she knew better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  exhaled, and Sachiko brought her attention back to the girl, who had  not, it appeared, been fazed by the sudden relative silence.  Even  the background noise—the constant, seemingly inescapable hum of  traffic, of the birds, of the insects—seemed to fade for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she  spoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko-<em>onee-sama</em>,”  she said, her voice now clear and true, “if you like、would  you please consider doubling up with me for our ride?” She kept her  eyes firmly fixed somewhere between Sachiko’s breasts and her  jawbone as she spoke--the only hint she provided as to how nervous  she actually was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  smiled at her, the reality of what she was being asked to do still  not striking home—to her, it was still just an odd foreign word,  some verb that she perhaps had not picked up properly over the course  of her English instruction. “Of course I will,” she said with  that same grin.  Her promise had the same validity as if it’d been  made for her by somebody else entirely—a promise made while  intoxicated, or perhaps while uninformed. She might have thought that  those two were not so dissimilar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  face lit up, and it seemed to Sachiko like the dénouement of a  dreary day, or perhaps the climax of a happy one, her expression a  ray of sunlight unabated by the clouds of the doubt that she would  invariably experience later—as most did. Sei said, “Hurry it up  already, would you? Or announce the wedding, or something. Rain’s  coming back soon, and I’d like not to get my baby dirty so soon  after I gave her a bath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  sound a little like a very old woman who gets very excited over her  cats, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Shimako said quietly and politely. “If  you’ll excuse my interruption.” She had a little grin on her  face, one which Sachiko did not notice, but Sei did—Sei thought it  to be very much a shit-eating grin, one which none of the rest  here—save, perhaps, for Yumi, who Sei thought probably knew her <em>petite soeur </em>best—would have believed in for a moment, like  some strange incarnation of a boogieman hiding just under a young,  pretty girl’s young, pretty nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako,  however light and airy she may have seemed at times, was not without  depth and edge; she was only very reserved and restrained, as Lillian  had taught them all to be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or most  of them anyway, Sei thought with a little shit-eating grin of her  own. <em>Most of them.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Doubling  up.” </em>Sachiko intoned it very carefully, giving each syllable  its own particular emphasis, so as not to botch up an unfamiliar  word—not such a danger in Japanese as in Chinese, which Sachiko  knew a little of, though speaking improperly still bore its own  dangers and consequences. Sachiko didn’t speak so in order to avoid  an embarrassing mistake, however. She said it as though she wanted to  clarify it. <em>You said </em>double up, <em>right? Yes, double up. </em>Double up. <em>Yes, double up. </em>Dou…ble…up.<em> Yes, that’s  it exactly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then,  what precisely is </em>this?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  doubling up, silly. Sitting two to a seat. Most uncomfortable and  dangerous, not to mention illegal.  Doubling up. Fun, isn’t it?  Like a game, only the goal is to stay out of jail and keep all your  teeth.  Doubling up. Some kind of fun. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  could, at first, only see this half of what she had agreed to when  Yumi asked her to please spread her legs as she sat, so that she  wouldn’t lose circulation as they drove.  Sachiko had done so  willingly enough, and then said it, said, “<em>Doubling up.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  said, “Yes, doubling up,” as though it were the most natural  thing in the world, and then she’d begun to crawl over her <em>Onee-sama</em> like a cat or a lover—the two were, according to  the former at least, interchangeable—and Sachiko had caught on at  last, and her mind jumped into its little tirade.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At last,  she managed to say, “Yumi, forgive me for being rude, but isn’t  this illegal?” <em>That’s probably why I never considered it to be  a viable possibility in the first place—everybody has that little  side of them that wants to do wrong, but I don’t think </em>this <em>sort of wrong ever occurred to me.  That must be it. I’m not </em>that <em>out of touch,</em> that <em>naïve.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yes, </em>she thought, <em>that must be it. I’m not stupid. This is a bad  idea, one beyond even my own capacity for bad ideas</em><br />
  self-doubt  must be kept to oneself for a lady who fishes appears as a fisher  long at sea<br />
  <em>but…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know it is, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Yumi said, her voice a little  sheepish, as it usually was when she was called out on something,  “but since we only have this one car, and…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Sachiko’s voice dropped to a whisper, so the rest, still outside,  couldn’t hear her, “but isn’t this something more suited for  Rei and Yoshino? People who,” <em>are comfortable like this arent  they. </em>She stopped. People who what?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>People  who are comfortable like this.  Aren’t they.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Aren’t  you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  stopped moving, chewed on her lip for a moment, considering the  fabric of the seat.  Then, tentatively, “Do you not want to…” <em>do this? You sound like a</em><br />
  lover<br />
  …<em>Like  a what?<br />
  </em><br />
  “I  just…I didn’t expect it, that’s all,” Sachiko said, privately  wondering why she was arguing. It would be nice to hold Yumi as this  would necessitate—she been close to Yumi before like <em>that</em>,  and the girl’s gentle warmth was always comforting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  the feeling of her hands, holding mine to her stomach, asking me to  shelter her. </em>It had only happened once, but…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  word had occurred to her then, as it occurred to her now: <em>Irony. </em>After all, wasn’t this ironic? How lovingly she had embraced  Yumi not an hour before, and how lovingly she had been embraced? And  how she now fought against doing the exact same thing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  it’s illegal.  It’s unsafe. </em>It sounded to her almost like  whining, and the only people who whined were the fearful.  Wasn’t  that one of the important lessons she’d learned?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Learned  from who?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>From  myself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then  who spoke to me before, telling me to silence my doubt?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Wasn’t  that also myself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  supposed that maybe it was. Sachiko wondered briefly if this was some  form of schizophrenia, and then dismissed it.  Insanity was a staple  of the rich sort, but not in a form that could be diagnosed by modern  medicine. <em>Not unless agonizing repression has found its way into  med schools without my noticing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  then, </em>said that voice of <em>me </em>with which Sachiko was so  ill-acquainted, <em>I ask you, what is it that you’re whining about? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  couldn’t answer.  She supposed that was a sign of progress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,”  she said, “I suppose that’s all right. Please have a seat, Yumi.”  She spread her legs a bit and patted the space between them, silently  thankful that she wasn’t wearing a skirt. Yumi smiled brightly, and  crawled over her <em>Onee-sama </em>as gracefully as she could—a  valiant effort to retain some semblance of propriety, but futile  nonetheless: There was simply no way to be proper as you crawled on  somebody, putting parts of yourself in places where they had no  business being outside of a bedroom, trying desperately not to slip  and botch the whole business—and, after a momentary struggle with  gravity and a seemingly frictionless seat fabric which should not  have existed outside of an introductory physics course, Sachiko found  Yumi seated neatly between her legs, the tip of her head just barely  touching Sachiko’s nose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  smiled, allowed herself to lean forward slightly. As gently as she  could, she inhaled deeply, taking in the girl’s scent and letting  it wash over her, bringing her entire body to a sort of peace she  hadn’t known in months.  If Yumi—or Shimako, now beginning her  own graceless clamber into the middle seat (it seemed that small cars  such as this simply had it out for proper Ladies such as  they)—noticed this, they said nothing of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  Shimako seated herself, Sachiko found that she had yet another  dilemma to contend with—where to place her hands. Perhaps the  others knew, having <em>doubled up</em> (it still sounded moderately  foreign to her) before—perhaps they had some otherworldly sense of  how to go about this whole messy business, in fact—but Sachiko was  completely at a loss. She raised her hand, previously resting  precisely where Shimako’s posterior was aimed, and let it hang in  the air for a moment, as though to hail a taxi, or perhaps simply to  ask her, <em>where to, buddy? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  hand darted up, taking Sachiko’s hanging limb with all the quick,  mildly amused grace of a lover wiping a crumb from her partner’s  lip—possibly with something other than a napkin or a  handkerchief—and brought it down, down to<br />
      <em>Warm<br />
        Her  hand is warm</em><br />
  her  stomach, held it there firmly for a moment, as though her shirt were  an odd sort of glue, and she wanted to make sure it stayed just so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  word occurred to Sachiko at this point, completely out of the  blue—odd, for her, but extremely well timed, as the other had been: <em>Opportunism. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is  that what this is? And if so, on whose part? </em>She supposed <em>that </em>was the real kicker, the question worth <em>all </em>the tea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  it was precisely the opposite. Maybe it didn’t matter at all. A  moment later she found her other hand—this one committing no  offenses against anyone’s posterior—in a similar position, a  gentle force pressing it into Yumi’s small belly. She could imagine  Yumi’s face at this point—undoubtedly burning red—innocent,  ready with some sort of excuse for the action, like <em>they weren’t  symmetrical.  It would have driven you crazy, </em>Onee-sama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko,  however, demanded no such excuse.  She only smiled and took another  breath, feeling herself utterly at peace for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a  lovely feeling indeed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It  was only a few minutes later that Sei closed the driver’s side door  and started the engine with a cry of, “Let’s be off, then!” but  it seemed to Sachiko an epoch, a span of time in which an entire era  might have shifted.  It reminded her of how she felt after coming  fully awake from a long, restful doze after a stressful day. (And  really, what day in the life of a Lady <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">wasn’t </span></em>a bit  stressful, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">for care must always be taken).</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  relaxed state lasted all of two minutes after the engine cleared its  throat once, twice, and then started, humming and rumbling underneath  her butt in a way that she wasn’t used to—all of her family’s  cars had top-of-the-line mufflers. In the first minute, Yumi said,  (speaking for the first time since putting Sachiko’s hands on her  belly—probably she was savoring the feeling as much as her <em>Onee-sama </em>was) “<em>Onee-sama</em>, I think you should move  your head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”  Sachiko said, not as surprised as she should have been to find her  voice a little bleary. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because…well.…”  At this, Yumi faltered a little, and Yoshino peered over the seat  ahead of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  Sei drives like a madwoman, and I think Yumi wants to tell you that  if you keep your head there, you’re likely to crack your teeth,”  Yoshino said, a sly little grin on her face that Sachiko didn’t  trust a bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi,  sit down over there,” Sei said, peering over as she set the car to  backing out—a bit too quickly for Sachiko’s liking, but the  parking lot was empty, wasn’t it? That was all. The others had  talked, but Sei couldn’t be <em>that </em>bad of a driver, right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  so, she moved her head, craning it forward a bit so that she could  rest it on Yumi’s shoulder. The sensation was not unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What’s  wrong with you? </em>something small inside of her said, in a voice  she didn’t recognize. <em>You’re like a horny little schoolgirl,  relishing every little chance you get to come in physical contact  with your </em>Petite Soeur<em>. Where is your </em>shame?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What’s  wrong with it? </em>she argued back, something she never would have  done before.<em> What’s wrong with touching somebody if touching  them makes us </em>both <em>happy? I haven’t felt so relaxed in</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  right have you to </em>relax? The voice said, seeming almost angry. <em>Who the hell said you could relax</em> now? <em>You’re to be wed  in less than three months, and—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Three  months?</em> Something sunk out of Sachiko's chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  wasn’t right, was it? It was still years on the horizon, wasn’t  it? Not until her first year of university was out, <em>at least. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  even so, it made a sick sort of sense to Sachiko. It couldn’t have  been true, but it made sense.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then the  car jerked into motion—the two of them, Sachiko and Yumi, were  veritably flattened against the back of the seat, and Shimako  actually let out a small yelp—as Sei forced her way into traffic,  earning Yoshino’s title of <em>lead-foot</em>, and Sachiko forgot  about marriage as she hung on to Yumi’s belly for dear life. Yumi  laughed a little wildly, Rei shouted at Sei to slow down (Sei acted  as though Rei was naught but the wind) and eventually, Sachiko found  herself laughing too. A little from fear, a little from excitement,  but laughing all the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  wonderful. Perverse, perhaps, but all the same. It was wonderful.</span></p>
