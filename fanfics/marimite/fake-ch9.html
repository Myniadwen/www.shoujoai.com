<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The <em>shinkansen </em>is the Japanese bullet train.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kyoto  is a city in Japan which is famous for being a place where you can  “meet old Japan.” It is slightly more rustic than Tokyo, though it is  certainly modern within its inner city; I think it’s the only place in  Japan where there are still a few feudal castles. (Six if I recall).  The views there range from fascinating to absolutely fucking  breathtaking. It is, of course, southeast of Tokyo. Incidentally, who  remembers where Sachiko is going to school?</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wow. I didn’t realize how heavy I had laid the innuendo on until just now.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Napoleon </em>is  a 5-player Japanese card game which is apparently very different from  its European counterpart. It is a game of taking tricks, a little like  Spades, I believe. Essentially, each round, the dealer is “napoleon.”  She calls out a card (usually a good trump card) and the bearer of that  card secretly becomes her “adjutant,” or team. She places a bid for how  many tricks she can take, and play commences. The goal is to take the  correct number of tricks without going under or taking all the tricks.</span></p>

<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All I need is for you to promise me that you won’t have a  bunch of balls of muscle and testosterone out looking for you when you  disappear for a few days, </span></em>she said. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All I need. </span></em>That was “all she needed,” like “all the dying man needed” was a new set of lungs in the middle of a war zone.<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><br />

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>BAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn, these are some lousy roads.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t use such coarse language, Onee-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. You’ve heard worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Muffled laughter. “She kind of has you there, Sei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, I could have had any number of girls as <em>petite soeurs. </em>Can somebody tell me why I picked the disguised smart-ass?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It sounds to me like she simply had a very good disguise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you calling her pretty, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cut off: “<em>Onee-sama!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wasn’t—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cut  off again: “A very curvy disguise, if you will. A pert, firm,  nicely-developed disguise. A very womanly disguise. Maybe even two  disguises.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cut off a third time. Almost giggling: “<em>Onee-sama!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, a voice which was not quite distressed, but getting there: “Come on, Sei! Onee-sama is trying to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, why am <em>I </em>the only one who gets yelled at? Yoshino is practically pounding on Rei’s arm, crying, <em>onee-sama! Onee-sama!</em>” A fairly good impression of Yoshino’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do not sound like that!” <em>Thump thump thump.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are pounding on my arm, though.” Finally able to finish a sentence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll wake <em>Onee-sama </em>up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi.  She sounded anxious, unpleasantly so. That would not do. Not at all. If  only something could be done. Something radical, but contained.  Something decisive, but not unnecessarily brutal. <em>You’re not planning a military strike. I think father did once. No, that was just a rumor. Corporate business isn’t </em>that <em>brutal.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  warm, comforting arm slid around her shoulder. The arm was small and a  little tense; unsure of how much it belonged where it was, like a cat  cautiously creeping its way onto the lap of someone who was mostly  asleep, ready to flee if that someone so much as jerked in the wrong  direction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s not right. I’m not going to lash out at you if I wake up, Yumi. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  thinking did Sachiko open her eyes with a sharp intake of breath, and,  just like the metaphorical cat, Yumi’s arm retreated immediately. She  blinked, bleary-eyed, for a moment, lamenting the loss of the warmth,  and then looked around, finding more or less exactly what she had found  just before she had blinked so heavily about...two hours ago. (Checking  the clock on the radio a row ahead of her). Then, they had been more or  less in the middle of a dense Tokyo roadfuck, trying desperately to get  onto the tollway that would take them more or less anywhere. No longer  crowded, they could spread out two or to a row, grouped by <em>soeurs</em>:  Rei and Yoshino in the back row, Yumi and Sachiko in the middle row,  and Sei and Shimako in the front. Somehow, Sei had wormed her way into  the driver’s seat again, through what trickery, Sachiko knew not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now,  they were on the open road; there were perhaps three other cars in  view, none of which could possibly be driving at legal speeds—Sachiko  knew this because she knew that their van was being passed, and Sei was  driving. Looking out the window, Sachiko could see a currently empty  rice paddy to her left, and a run of <em>shinkansen </em>track that extended as far as she could see off to her right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi.”  Sachiko blinked hard, trying to get rid of a strange glare that seemed  suddenly to invade her sight from all directions. “Where…” she put her  hand to her mouth reflexively and yawned, trying as hard as she could  not to bare her tonsils to the world, or even to her palm. “Where are  we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think we’re headed southeast on the tollway right now, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Yumi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko frowned. “Southeast?” <em>We’re not in Tokyo anymore; not even on the outskirts. What could possibly be southeast any farther? </em>“Where are we going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thought I’d take us down to Kyoto for starters.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kyoto? What could there possibly be in Kyoto? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Castles?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Scenery?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Almost  reflexively, Sachiko turned to face Yumi, who was sitting comfortably  in her own seat, only about half a meter from Sachiko, in spite of the  ample space they had on their bench. Yumi did not seem to have reacted  to the mention of Kyoto. Did that mean she had forgotten? Sachiko could  only hope so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei hadn’t, forgotten, though. Simply from the tone of her voice, Sachiko could see this. It made her cringe, very slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino turned around in her seat and took a quick look at Yumi, who was sitting on her side with her arms pressed a little <em>too </em>close  to herself, and Sachiko who she noted looked a bit overly distressed,  though she could only guess at why. (In reality, she could guess very  well at it, but she did not know that at the time.) “Hey, instead of  sitting there looking awkward, why don’t we do something productive?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi blinked and relaxed without trying to. “Productive?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko frowned, suddenly worried. “You mean…like knitting?” <em>I don’t know how to knit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  this, both Yoshino and Yumi burst out laughing, though Yumi’s was more  of a set of confined giggles, whereas Yoshino laughed outright for a  moment before Rei clapped a hand over her mouth without actually  looking up from whatever it was that she was doing. “Yoshino,” she said  with a touch of amusement that utterly destroyed the disapproving tone  she was going for. Then, to Sachiko, “I’m sorry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s <em>your </em>fault,” Yoshino said when Rei finally removed her hand. “<em>You’re </em>the one that <em>is </em>knitting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll be grateful for it later.” Rei said. “When it gets cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not the point! And besides, when is that going to be? Did you not notice the air conditioning in this car?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  shrugged helplessly, and Sachiko thought privately that she looked more  and more like a mother every time she saw the two of them—Yoshino and  Rei—together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A mother, or something else.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko fought down her blush successfully by reciting that poem that she could not quite get out of her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(All-gone all-gone)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>S</em><em>omething else like you and Yumi?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(Cattail fish is all-gone)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something like that has no business making you blush. What are you doing, idiot girl?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was much harder than it ought to have been, because as she was doing this, Yumi was inching closer again, a little like a</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(scorned lover trying to)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">cat  again. And just like a cat, Sachiko knew that again, if she shifted too  quickly, Yumi would retreat almost soundlessly, unnoticeably. She knew  that there was more than one way to catch (or skin) a cat, however, and  so Sachiko, in a moment of self-indulgence and near superhuman speed,  reached out and caught Yumi around the shoulders. “Yumi,” she said,  intending to say something reassuring so that the girl wouldn’t try and  pull away. Before she could even begin her sentence, however, Sei  shouted from up front with timing that seemed almost precognitive:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall we do something productive?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi jerked in her seat and her face turned a bright shade of red.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oddly  enough, Sachiko did something very nearly the same. Out of habit, she  nearly shouted, (really, her voice only rose a notch or two, but it was  a stretch for the girl) “<em>Rosa Gigantea!” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two voices  responded from the front seat, nearly at the same time with a simple,  “Yes?” One of them was inquisitive. The other was nearly snickering.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ignore her,” Rei said shortly, not looking up from her knitting. “It’s the best way to make her be quiet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the <em>only </em>way,” Shimako said from the front.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two have absolutely no respect for your <em>sempai</em>,” Sei said. “I find that in almost unbearably poor taste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something funny happened. Sachiko opened her mouth to say, <em>You two need to be more respectful of your </em>sempai, <em>even if she is being fairly lewd, </em>with  a scolding tone. It was almost reflexive, the same as how her leg  jumped when the doctor tapped on it just right with a little rubber  hammer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she shut her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What is going on in  this trip? It’s like we left all our manners in Tokyo. What does that  say about our characters? If we, as graduates and students of Lillian,  become raucous as soon as there is nobody around to see us, what does  that make us? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fake?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>My dear, what do you think manners </em>are?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They are signs of good character! </em>This she believed most vehemently. <em>Good breeding and good character are displayed first and foremost by proper manners!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And what about a good life? How do you display to the world that you are capable of enjoying yourself like a normal human being?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko found that she had no acceptable answer to that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi moved under her and her attention left herself. “What is it, Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,” Yumi said in a voice which was entirely relaxed. “I’m just shifting, <em>onee-sama.” </em>And then, a little bit more nervously, “You’re very comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What kind of a sentence is </em>that<em>? Am I a pillow? What would mother think if she heard that? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I think that right now, you kind of are. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  Yumi moved into a more comfortable position just over Sachiko’s breast,  Sachiko felt that denying entirely would be useless, and hypocritical  of her since she was essentially the one who had put Yumi there. <em>Besides…admit  it. It’s comfortable. The gentle pressure over your heart, the small  warmth that seems to seep into your breast; it’s nice. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko would admit to no such thing, of course. Still, it was a nice thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How do you display to the world…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very nice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That you enjoy yourself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I enjoy myself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another compelling argument.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Compelling indeed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Apparently,  “something productive” was playing cards. Sachiko didn’t particularly  mind this; she rather enjoyed it, in fact. Rei had taken a break from  her knitting to sit in on the game, and Shimako had, at Yoshino’s  behest, slid back to take a place in the game as well. Sachiko had  asked Sei if she was all right being left out—an apology of sorts,  probably, for her earlier scolding tone—but Sei only laughed and told  Sachiko to enjoy herself with “the girls.” Sachiko hadn’t the faintest  idea what that meant. Sachiko then proceeded to point out to Sei that  swapping seats so frequently was very dangerous, especially considering  the driver, and Sei told Sachiko very politely to kindly please piss  off and get back in her seat. She said it with a laugh, and oddly  enough, Sachiko laughed too.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How do you show the world?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When they sat back down,  the game became 5-player Napoleon. It was an odd sort of free-for-all,  which was not really a free-for-all at all, since each round, the  dealer formed a secret “alliance” that she did not know until the card  which signified the alliance was played. Yumi was not particularly  useful when she was made the dealer’s “adjutant,” since as soon as the  card was called, her face lit up, revealing itself to be bearing a neon  sign which read, <em>I’m this round’s adjutant! Careful of letting me take anything!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko,  however, more than made up for that. Her intuition was sharp, but more  than that, she was very good at guessing how many tricks she could  take; mostly she did this by estimating conservatively, but she often  was able to entice her opponents into giving up their trumps early.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If only the same could be said about your life.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What </em>trumps, <em>exactly?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Your own.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That makes no sense.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  yet, in a strange sort of way, it did. And when she admitted that to  herself, something funny happened to her: She started to laugh a little  bit more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How indeed.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sachiko  won, and by a long margin. Yoshino accused her of playing “for keeps,”  whatever that meant, and Shimako said quietly, “I don’t think I’ve ever  been beaten quite that badly.” Yoshino told her that she should be  grateful for small favors. After that, Shimako retreated to the front  seat <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(dangerously, </span></em>Sachiko thought) and Yumi settled back on  Sachiko’s stomach and fell almost immediately asleep—she must have been  more exhausted than Sachiko had thought.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of course she was. You were a tremendous burden on her today. You are always a</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shut up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You are always. Always.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shut. Up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  found that she was increasingly gaining control over some of these  thoughts which seemed to swell and pop in her head without warning,  destroying her self-assuredness, and that they influenced her less as a  result. She put her hand on Yumi’s head and let her breath out slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her hair is so soft. It’s nice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not like</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not thinking about that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not thinking about that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko shook her head sharply, violently. She thought nobody noticed, but in reality, not one of them <em>didn’t notice</em>. What she didn’t see could have filled a book:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  nudged Rei, who glanced briefly over to indicate she had noticed too.  Underneath the blanket Yoshino had found (with the air conditioning  that Sei insisted on pumping, it was actually fairly cool in the  car—cool enough for a blanket, anyway) Rei squeezed her cousin’s hand  reassuringly. <em>Don’t worry about it. It’s nothing; she’s more or less under control, and if she’s not, we can deal with it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino squeezed the hand back, and thought, <em>It’s not Sachiko I’m worried about. It’s the girl who passed out in</em> <em>her  lap the second after she lost at Napoleon. Yesterday, Yumi was  energetic and practically frothing at the mouth, she was so excited to  see her </em>onee-sama. <em>She got a good night’s sleep, and had a good  breakfast this morning, and it’s been less than ten hours since she  woke up, but she looks like she hasn’t slept for a week. This is  fucking killing her; maybe faster than it’s killing Sachiko.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  wasn’t entirely fair, and Yoshino knew it, but she didn’t care. She  squeezed Rei’s hand again, looking at Sachiko, and Rei shook her head  sharply.<em> Don’t you dare. You know it’s nothing like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s not fair, </em>Yoshino thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Neither are you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Neither is anything. Get used to it, sister.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the front seat, Sei glanced in the mirror just in time to see Sachiko’s  sharp, violent shake, as though she was trying to wrench her head off  in a single go. Shimako, by the same chance, noticed it in the same  way. They glanced at each other, and Shimako mouthed, <em>“I’m worried  about the both of them back there. Do you think stopping somewhere for  the evening would be a good idea? I think that if we give them a good  chance to rest, it would do them a world of good; giving them some time  alone wouldn’t be a bad idea either; I think the two of them need some  time to work things out in private.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a shit-eating grin, Sei mouthed back, <em>“I can’t read lips.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako  pursed her lips and Sei winked at her, and Shimako knew that Sei had  understood. As they rounded a bend, a sign came into view: <em>Lodging: 13 KM. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sounds good to me, </em>Shimako thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei thought so too, but she said it a different way.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was awakened as Sei raised her voice, not turning around but  not for lack of trying—Shimako was keeping close watch over her to make  sure she kept a close watch on the road. “Alright, everybody. We’ve  been driving for something like 3 hours now, and we’re about an hour  and a half from Kyoto. I think we’ve all gotten to know each other a  little better now, so let’s be honest.” <em>The sound of attention being gathered is so sweet. </em>“Whose bladder is full?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence filled the car in much the same way molten lead might.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, admit it, show of hands.” Sei would not be cowed so easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Grudgingly,  slowly at first, and then quickly towards the end (as though to avoid  being recognized in a small group of close friends) hands went up—in  the end, not a single person had not admitted to at least <em>owning </em>a bladder—Sachiko included, which verily shocked her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As  far as your guests and friends are concerned, you have no bladder, no  stomach, and no sweat glands. You will in no way trouble your guests  nor your hosts for anything so trivial. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking back on it,  Sachiko had received that lesson when she was quite young, and it had  actually been a trick to keep herself from giggling—mostly, the thought  of the hard, unkind slap she would receive if she so much as breathed  hard during something that a normal child might perceive as funny kept  her in line.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I guess I have a bladder, huh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Huh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  a hotel coming up in about five minutes. I vote we stay there the  night, and get a fresh start tomorrow. Who else is in?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds like a wonderful idea, Sei,” Rei said, her voice leaving no room for dissention. Not that there was any.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Staying at a hotel. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  a strange thing—I’ve never even done it once. Not with friends nor with  family. Isn’t it supposed to be a fun thing to do? Certainly that  disqualifies family, then, but what about friends?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How do you show the world you can enjoy yourself like a normal person?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko had the feeling she might find out soon enough.</span></p>
