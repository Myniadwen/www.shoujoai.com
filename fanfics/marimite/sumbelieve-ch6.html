Yumi moaned into her pillow.

&quot;What did you say?&quot; asked Yuuki, frowning at his sister, though his 
eyebrows rose in humorous observation at her complaints. &quot;Because all I 
heard through the pillow was mzmrpouh Touko-channnnn,&quot; Yuuki sing songed 
the younger girl&#39;s name in a disturbing parody of Yumi.

&quot;Not funny, Yuuki,&quot; said Yumi with a definite pout, trying to whap him 
with her pillow.

&quot;But accurate all the same,&quot; Yuuki laughed, dodging the pillow and 
jumping to his feet. Taking sympathy on his sibling as he watched her 
groan and collapse on the bed, he suggested, &quot;Why not ask Sachiko for 
advice?&quot;

Yumi sat up, observing Yuuki with a look of horror. &quot;I can&#39;t ask 
oneesama for help on my date with Touko-chan.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; asked Yuuki with a teasing expression. &quot;Because you&#39;re cheating 
on her?&quot; Instantly, Yumi&#39;s face fell and Yuuki realized his mistake. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, sis, I didn&#39;t mean--&quot;

&quot;But I am, aren&#39;t I?&quot; said Yumi, turning her gaze away from him. &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t be if I chose Kanako-chan for my petite soeur but with 
Touko-chan it isn&#39;t the same.&quot;

&quot;You care for her like you care for Sachiko,&quot; said Yuuki, his tone a bit 
disbelieving. He never thought that he would see the day anyone could 
come close to taking Sachiko&#39;s place in his sister&#39;s heart but the way 
she had been acting lately with Touko&#133; perhaps it was a real 
possibility.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yumi admitted this almost painfully. She lifted her head to look 
at him rather desperately. &quot;I can&#39;t help it though. Touko-chan reminds 
me so much of oneesama but in another way, a really good way. And I want 
to take care of her, make her happy, but it&#39;s different with her, Yuuki. 
She&#133;&quot; Yumi trailed off, her features growing still as she stared at 
something only she could see.

&quot;She what?&quot; questioned Yuuki.

&quot;She wants to be loved and I want to love her,&quot; said Yumi finally, a 
soft but sad smile on her features. &quot;Oneesama doesn&#39;t want that.&quot;

&quot;Sachiko loves you,&quot; said Yuuki, a little in shock at hearing what 
equaled to his sister declaring she was giving up on her love for 
Sachiko. &quot;You know that.&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Yumi agreed, that sad smile remaining on her face. &quot;And I love 
oneesama, I always will, but I know she won&#39;t really let me love her or 
really let herself love me back. Not to the fullest, not when she has to 
live up to the expectations of her family.&quot;

&quot;But she doesn&#39;t have to!&quot; Yuuki cried, suddenly struck by how very 
unfair it was. He knew that Sachiko loved his sister and he knew his 
sister loved Sachiko. Why couldn&#39;t they be together? It was all just so 
stupid.

&quot;Oneesama thinks she does,&quot; said Yumi simply, closing her eyes and 
taking a long breath. &quot;And as long as she thinks that we can&#39;t be 
together.&quot; Opening her eyes, Yumi stared down at her hands, pulling at 
the blanket on her bed. &quot;I could wait for her to change her mind, I&#39;ve 
already tried to change it myself and it didn&#39;t work.&quot; Looking up at 
Yuuki, she said quietly, &quot;But it was oneesama who told me not to wait. 
To find a petite soeur because I would need the support once she went 
away.&quot;

&quot;Yumi,&quot; said Yuuki dejectedly. He stared at her for a moment then formed 
a determined expression. &quot;Wait here,&quot; he commanded and then he went 
running out of the room. Yumi looked after him in confusion but he soon 
returned carrying an armful of magazines. &quot;Dating research!&quot; he 
announced proudly, plopping the magazines onto Yumi&#39;s bed. Grinning 
widely, he winked at his sister. &quot;With all the advice in here we&#39;re 
bound to come up with something Touko-chan should like.&quot;

Watching her brother rift through the pile of magazines, Yumi smiled 
slowly. He truly did want the best for her and somehow, without her 
explaining, he knew right now that was Touko. Kind as this was of him, 
Yumi couldn&#39;t help but tease her brother, just a little, about having an 
extensive collection of magazines with dating information. That was the 
way of being a big sister, after all.

---

In the end, Yumi didn&#39;t take Touko to any of the magazine suggested date 
spots. She did, however, make use of the advice one of them gave her. 
Namely to pick something that appealed to the interests of your date but 
would genuinely hold your own attention as well.

Which is how Yumi came to stand with Touko in front of the Tokyo 
Takarazuka Theatre, her hands flying from their place covering the 
younger girl&#39;s eyes as she exclaimed, &quot;Ta dah!&quot;

The sounds of people milling about, cars honking, music blaring but no 
response from Touko. Biting the inside of her lip, Yumi wondered if 
maybe the magazine had gravely misled her. Then Touko looked at her, 
eyes shining with excitement and Yumi knew that at long last she had 
done the right thing regarding Touko.

Not that she always thought she did the wrong thing but the younger girl 
could be so hard to read that Yumi often second guessed herself. It was 
nice, for once, to not feel that. To simply see Touko smiling happily 
and filled with joy.

&quot;Shall we go inside?&quot; Yumi suggested, lacing her fingers with Touko&#39;s 
and taking a step towards the theatre. Her momentum was soon stopped by 
a subtle tug at her hand. Looking back, she saw Touko&#39;s head was 
lowered. At once, Yumi frowned, wondering if she had been wrong and the 
other girl actually wasn&#39;t happy with her choice. &quot;Touko-chan? Is 
something the matter?&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot; asked Touko quietly, her head still lowered.

Yumi blinked in confusion then she realized that Touko was asking how 
she had known that she would want to come here. Smiling tenderly, Yumi 
stepped closer, reaching out to cup the girl&#39;s cheek, causing Touko&#39;s 
eyes to lift and meet her own. &quot;Because I pay very close attention to 
what Touko-chan likes,&quot; replied Yumi fondly, her thumb moving against 
soft skin in a gentle caress. &quot;In hopes it might help her to like me.&quot;

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; Touko breathed and her lips moved silently as if in an 
unspoken confession. She looked helplessly into Yumi&#39;s kind gaze before 
dropping her eyes to the ground.

Forming an expression of disappointed understanding, Yumi&#39;s hand fell 
down and she laced her fingers with Touko&#39;s once again. Pulling the 
younger girl forward, she said brightly, &quot;Lets go inside! The show is 
about to start.&quot;

In truth, they had thirty minutes before the curtain lifted.

---

Two hours later, the humor of the playwright and skills of the actors 
portraying his words had removed all traces of earlier unease. Smiling 
and exchanging anecdotes about scenes in the play, they stepped out into 
the dimming sunlight of late afternoon.

Reaching for Touko&#39;s hand with a hopeful look in her eyes, Yumi asked, 
&quot;Are you hungry? We have plenty of time for lunch.&quot;

Touko paused, seeming to contemplate seriously and something in Yumi 
just knew this wasn&#39;t good for her. Whenever Touko appeared to think too 
hard about things involving Yumi the older girl inevitably got rejected. 
Thus, Yumi made it her immediate objective to remove any thoughts from 
Touko&#39;s mind.

This meant the tickle monster had to be brought out of retirement.

&quot;Say yes, Touko-chan,&quot; Yumi began, wearing a semi-threatening expression 
as she neared the other girl.

&quot;Yumi-sama?&quot; Touko questioned, instinctively backing away.

With that, Yumi launched her attack. Wearing an almost wicked smile, 
Yumi&#39;s hands curled outwards like frightening claws which attacked 
Touko&#39;s midsection. Digging at her flesh mercilessly until the younger 
girl was doubled over with laughter. &quot;Say yes,&quot; repeated Yumi, not 
letting up in the slightest, even though her antics were drawing quite a 
bit of attention.

&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped Touko through her laughter. &quot;Just stop!&quot;

Instantly, Yumi&#39;s hands stilled and she wore an expression of great 
satisfaction. Spinning on her heel to face forward, she stuck her arm 
backwards, hand outstretched in a silent imitation of the gesture Touko 
had made weeks earlier. A moment passed then Yumi felt the warmth of 
Touko&#39;s hand in hers. A wide smile on her face, she looked to the other 
girl. &quot;Where should we eat?&quot; Yumi questioned.

&quot;Anywhere is fine,&quot; murmured Touko, ears red as she noticed the stares 
that accompanied them as they walked down the street. Exactly how many 
people had seen Yumi&#39;s shameless attack on her anyway?

&quot;Anywhere is not fine when it involves Touko-chan,&quot; Yumi pouted, pulling 
the younger girl forward until she walked at her side. &quot;You have to pick 
something.&quot; She formed an entreating expression and said, &quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;Why does it matter so much that I pick?&quot; asked Touko wearily.

&quot;Because I want to know all of your favorite things,&quot; replied Yumi, 
smiling happily at Touko. &quot;So,&quot; she dipped her head down and brought her 
face close to Touko&#39;s. &quot;Will you tell me?&quot;

There was another long pause and Yumi feared Touko was thinking yet 
again when she released a sigh and said in something of a mumble, 
&quot;Thai.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Yumi asked, honestly unable to hear.

&quot;Thai food,&quot; said Touko reluctantly, averting her gaze. &quot;That&#39;s my 
favorite.&quot;

Another little piece of the wall around Touko&#39;s heart had been chipped 
away and Yumi felt a thrill at this. Giving Touko&#39;s hand a gentle 
squeeze, she looked into ambivalent blue eyes as they lifted to meet her 
own. &quot;Where do we get the best Thai food?&quot; she asked.

For a response, Touko&#39;s eyes glinted and she formed a wicked smile that 
put Yumi&#39;s to shame.</pre>
