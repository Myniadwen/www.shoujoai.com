<h1>Something to Believe (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sumbelieve-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The problem with Yumi was her popularity and the fact she didn&#39;t care 
about it. This made life more than a little difficult for Touko who did 
care about Yumi&#39;s popularity. Mostly because she had to deal with the 
aftermath.

Aftermath being jealous and enraged fangirls. Jealous that Yumi wanted 
Touko for her petite soeur and enraged that Touko had dared to reject 
her. Which made no sense to Touko. If they loved Yumi so much shouldn&#39;t 
they be glad she rejected her? It did leave the petite soeur field wide 
open, after all.

But Touko knew what fueled their rage. Yumi and her damned insistence 
that she wanted only Touko for her petite soeur. Something that 
irritated Touko to no end because she just knew it wasn&#39;t true. What 
Yumi wanted was someone to distract her from Sachiko, to take her mind 
off the upcoming marriage and departure from school. The truth was, it 
didn&#39;t have to be Touko, it could be anyone but it was easier with her.

She was aware of the situation with Sachiko and as such Touko wouldn&#39;t 
press Yumi in ways another petite soeur might. Demanding Yumi spend time 
away from Sachiko and with her, becoming jealous of Sachiko&#39;s importance 
in her life. Yumi thought Touko would never do such things and that made 
her a very appealing petite soeur.

The truth of the matter was, Touko wanted to do all those things. Well, 
no, she didn&#39;t want to do those things because they were so insufferably 
childish and stupid but she did have the natural urge.

Really, Touko couldn&#39;t help it. She, like countless others in her grade, 
instinctively liked Yumi. And another problem with Yumi, particularly 
for Touko, was the more time you spent with her the more likable she 
became. Hell, she transformed into someone downright lovable.

And despite what some might think, Touko wasn&#39;t immune tot Yumi&#39;s 
charms. Sometimes she wished she was. Lately Touko wish for that almost 
all the time. It was getting disgustingly hard to be around Yumi and her 
lovability with the constant exclamations of how she wanted Touko for 
her petite soeur. Because the more she heard this, the more Touko wanted 
it to be true.

She wanted to be the person Yumi cared for, the one she leaned on, the 
one who held the biggest place in her heart. But Touko knew that place 
already belonged to Sachiko and she also knew how much Sachiko needed 
Yumi&#39;s love. No matter how Yumi was hurting at the idea of losing 
Sachiko there was no doubt in Touko&#39;s mind that Sachiko was hurting 
more. Touko saw how empty Sachiko&#39;s life was before she had Yumi. A life 
filled with people admiring her at a distance but never getting close 
and never easing Sachiko&#39;s loneliness. Then Yumi came and smashed down 
all the perceived barriers Sachiko had around her and at last she was 
happy.

How could Touko take that away? Even if Yumi asked it of her it didn&#39;t 
seem right. But, oh, how she was tempted. Just like Yumi had done for 
Sachiko, she easily found her way into Touko&#39;s heart. Worming her way 
in, she slowly began chipping away at the walls Touko had been forming 
since her childhood. And the more Yumi chipped away the more Touko 
longed to let her in completely.

Then she would remind herself of Sachiko and she found herself fighting 
those feelings.

Though it was difficult, desperately so.

Especially with Yumi persistently waiting for her every day at school. 
Waiting at her classroom door to have lunch with her, to walk her to her 
clubs, and to accompany her home. All with the jealous and enraged 
fangirls watching.

&quot;Touko-chan?&quot;

Blinking several times, Touko looked up, finding herself face to face 
with Yumi who was gazing at her with some concern. &quot;Your face is red,&quot; 
Yumi noted worriedly, somehow unaware her proximity was what caused 
this. Before Touko could reply, Yumi leaned forward and rested her 
forehead against the other girl&#39;s and murmured, &quot;You aren&#39;t feverish.&quot; 
Pulling away, she placed her hand gently on Touko&#39;s forehead, tenderly 
pushing her hair aside. Spellbound by the soft and cool feeling of 
Yumi&#39;s hand on her skin, Touko stared blankly up at the older girl who 
frowned slightly. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;

It was the rumblings of the jealous and enraged fangirls that snapped 
Touko out of her Yumi induced trance. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Yumi-sama!&quot; Touko 
exclaimed, jumping to her feet, chair clattering behind her.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Yumi, studying the other girl with genuine care 
and approaching her again.

Gathering her book bag, Touko gave a quick bow and said, &quot;I&#39;m sure, 
thank you for your concern.&quot; Then she turned and walked out the 
classroom, all too aware of the stares and calls of Yumi following her.

She ignored them all and kept walking, quietly cursing in her head the 
entire time. What happened to her loyalty to Sachiko? She promised 
herself that she wouldn&#39;t be the one to take Yumi from Sachiko. Or at 
least be the one to mistakenly believe that was possible. Because Touko 
wasn&#39;t stupid. She knew when people fit together. When they were meant 
to be.

Yumi and Sachiko were the definition of that.

So why didn&#39;t Yumi know that and leave her alone, Touko wondered. 
Closing her eyes in a false prayer before Maria-sama she heard the sound 
of footsteps and breathless gasps of air and knew it was Yumi behind 
her.

Calm, controlled, collected, Touko reminded herself as she opened her 
eyes and faced her sempai. &quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; she greeted, unable to help 
being friendly to Yumi. But hopefully not too friendly, it would go 
against all her work so far.

&quot;Touko-chan,&quot; Yumi began slowly, looking so unsure and vulnerable that 
Touko had to fight the urge to comfort her. Her eyes fell to the ground 
then lifted as she said, &quot;You aren&#39;t avoiding me, are you?&quot;

&quot;Why would I do that, Yumi-sama?&quot; Touko questioned, forming her best 
guileless expression and tilting her head to one side.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why,&quot; said Yumi hesitantly. &quot;You just left so quickly that 
I thought&#133;&quot; She trailed off, looking incredibly lost before she shook 
her head and smiled brightly at Touko. Bouncing forward on her toes, 
Yumi reached for the younger girl&#39;s hands and leaned forward to put 
their faces close together. &quot;I have a very important question for 
Touko-chan,&quot; she proclaimed.

Calm, controlled, collected, Touko repeated in her head as she stepped 
back to leave more space between herself and Yumi. &quot;Oh?&quot; she asked, 
trying to appear bored while attempting to slow her fast heartbeat.

&quot;Will you please go on a half date with me this Saturday?&quot; questioned 
Yumi, holding their hands up as if in a prayer and looking beseechingly 
at Touko.

&quot;A half date?&quot; Touko echoed, her brain suddenly malfunctioning.

&quot;A half date,&quot; enforced Yumi, smiling and nodding her head emphatically. 
She bounced closer to Touko and looked at her with wide and entreating 
eyes. &quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;Just say yes, Touko!&quot;

Jerking her head, Touko turned to see a mischievous looking Noriko in a 
crowd of students which had appeared out of nowhere to surround them. 
Scowling heavily, Touko turned on her heel, walking away from the crowd 
and fully intending on taking Yumi with her. Except the older girl 
refused to budge.

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; said Touko in tones that were very tight but she also hoped 
were controlled. &quot;Lets go.&quot;

&quot;Not until Touko-chan gives me an answer,&quot; said Yumi firmly.

Her scowl returning and her frustration increasing as the crowd moved 
closer, Touko forgot all about being calm, controlled, and collected. 
&quot;Fine,&quot; she said, thoroughly exasperated. &quot;I agree.&quot;

&quot;To what?&quot; asked Yumi playfully, deciding to push her luck.

Immediately Touko&#39;s face darkened and pulling her hands free, she walked 
towards the gates of the school. Yumi pouted at Touko&#39;s departure and 
was soon running right after her. Hooking their arms together, she took 
advantage of Touko&#39;s disarmed state and pressed a kiss to her cheek. 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured against Touko&#39;s skin. &quot;Thank you for saying 
yes.&quot; Then just as fast, she pulled away and ran off into the distance, 
leaving the younger girl to walk home alone for the first time in a 
week.

Uncontrolled, Touko&#39;s hand rose to touch her cheek, her skin warm where 
Yumi had kissed it, as she watched her run away. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she 
whispered.</pre>
