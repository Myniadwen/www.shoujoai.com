<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If you  hadn’t noticed, each of my chapter titles is actually a song name  or lyric.  Point out any of the artists and win a gold star.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Suguru announces the arrival of our first two lovely ladies, you  should take “miss” to mean something like “-sama.”  I have  written them family-name last, in all spite of tradition, for  continuity.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, I  am not going to explain the joke about ‘powdering the nose’  unless people really don’t get it, in which case you’ll see it in  the next set of author’s notes.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  could I believe when this cloud hangs over me/  You’re the part  of me that I don’t want to see.</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I could  live forever here.</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Forget it</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sa-chan?”  Suguru’s voice found its way into Sachiko’s room like so many  unwelcome peeping toms.  She heard it all too clearly, standing in  front of her mirror re-combing her hair for the third time—a lady’s  vanity, one of the many things nobody expected of her, and one of the  many things she would never, ever let onto, as testified to by her  dozens of fans at Lillian who positively swore that she leapt out of  bed each morning with her hair looking like the very symbol of  perfection that it was.  “You have guests.” His voice was  astonishingly curt.  There was no hint of the halfway-upbeat teasing,  nor of the subtle, untraceable note of</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>spite </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">distaste <em>that was only to be expected from a man of his tastes who was  destined to be wed to a woman such as myself, </em>Sachiko quickly  rationalized, not wanting to delve into psycho-analyzing his voice  overly much.  Not now, anyway. “Who is it?” she asked as  pleasantly as possible, forcing herself to ignore Suguru’s obvious  irritability. <em>Getting into character, </em>said that mean, hateful  little voice inside of her head, that voice that, try as she might,  she could not get to stop sounding so much like her mother’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Miss  Rei Hasekura,” he said, intoning their names as formally as they  themselves had probably done as they announced their arrival, “And  Miss Yoshino Shimazu. They await you downstairs. I told them,” he  said ironically, “that you had to finish powdering your nose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In all  spite of her mood and his, Sachiko had to clamp a hand firmly over  her mouth at that to stifle her laugh.  It was a joke her mother  would have never even acknowledged, and one which any woman of good<br />
      <em>sheltering</em><br />
  breeding  would never have expected a man to make. <em>And don’t forget to  wipe, </em>he would have finished, were he a man of worse breeding  than he was.  Even in his irritable mood, however, he would never  openly admit to making a <em>(heaven forbid)</em> dirty joke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wondered about that, in any case—were he truly in so foul a mood,  he would never have bothered to make her laugh like that. <em>He would  simply keep it to himself and laugh at me in his room as he<br />
  A  lady does not brood. Not even about<br />
  Not  thinking about that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  refused to marvel, as she would have liked to, over how spiteful she  herself could be, however.  She had guests waiting for her, and she  supposed her hair would have to do.  “Kashi…” <em>be nice.</em> “Suguru,” she called back suddenly, without entirely knowing why.   Maybe just to see if he was still there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything  for my lady,” he said quietly, his voice still ironic.  “I will  make sure not to intrude upon your meal, and I’ll take your calls  personally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt  a pang of guilt at this, and didn’t entirely know why, but it  didn’t go away as the sound of his footsteps clomped down the hall,  fading quickly into nothingness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  frowned and took one final, almost obligatory glance into the mirror.   She had considered dressing as she usually did for parties and  events—an entirely conservative <em>kimono </em>in her choice of red,  purple, or blue, complete with sash and clunky wooden sandals.  Today, however, was different.  She justified it by telling herself  that she was going outside, and that such unpragmatic dress would  only lead to disaster at some point or another, but what was  important was the result: A simple cream-colored coat with a  light-blue button-up shirt underneath <em>(which you must never undo  even if it becomes so hot that the lakes themselves begin to boil  they’ll see your shoulders) </em>and pants which hugged her form and  hid it all at once, wrought from a black, silken material.  She wore  shoes that weren’t quite dress shoes, but weren’t entirely  sneakers, either.  She wore a silk scarf as well <em>(to hide your  neck from the men) </em>but she would probably remove that <em>(you  slut) </em>if it became too hot <em>(you must never become a slut like  them they never wear scarves and always remove their coats to show  their shoulders). </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  decided it was fine, ignored her mother’s voice, now veritably  screaming at her, and exited her room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  far easier to move in these shoes, she decided, than it was in those  wooden clogs. Easier to stand up straight, to not trip.  Not that she  ever tripped in any event, but walking in these, she felt a huge,  unfathomable burden lifted from her shoulders as she went.  She felt  casual, she felt comfortable. <em>(Dangerous things). </em>She  felt…something very much like happiness flooding through her, in  fact.  For the first time in months, there were friends waiting for  her in her house. <em>And soon, Yumi. </em>At this thought, her house  started immediately to seem less like a<br />
      <em>prison</em><br />
  big,  empty castle and more like …</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  like home.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  able to descend the wide, short stairs almost silently, something she  marveled at, but she did not revel so in walking that she failed to  stop, as she always did, at the door just before the guest room where  Suguru or one of the servants would have undoubtedly directed Rei and  Yoshino to by now. She stopped there because of the mirror which hung  on the door; a small thing, at face level, so that she could see her  expression very clearly in it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>More  important than makeup or hair is your expression, which you must  always check before you greet even your closest friends, because your  expression </em>is <em>makeup.  If incorrectly applied, people will  think worse of you, much like a woman who heaps on too much or  applies none at all; and like makeup, small hints and changes applied  in simply innocuous areas can make all the difference in the world to  that end. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  found her expression needed very little touching up, which pleased  her.  Her mouth was naturally curved up in a polite grin, though it  was a little too open for her<br />
      <em>mother’s</em><br />
  tastes.  She fixed it easily, and then opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next  room was by and far the most plush and cushy in the house—it had to  be, her mother had said when they furnished it, because it was the  room in which you inconvenienced your guests to wait.  The walls were  a gentle, soothing cream color, spotlessly painted, with pictures of  landscapes, both painted and photographed, all along it.  The couches  which lined it were the same color, and the most comfortable in the  house.  There was music coming from hidden speakers in the walls,  gentle and traditional, and the carpet—the only room that was  carpeted—was smooth, not rough and grainy like most rugs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In all,  a perfect room for a deception, if one was needed.  Which it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei and  Yoshino were seated on the center and right edge, respectively, of  the couch facing Sachiko, dressed simply in jeans and  sweaters—Sachiko was used to being silently accused of  overdressing—and both smiled openly and unguardedly as she entered,  and rose to meet her as gentlemen might.  They both bowed deeply and  formally, though Yoshino’s was anxious and frustrated, and then  moved towards her and, before she could protest, threw their arms  around her at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The hug  was brief and sisterly, and the room was empty, but still Sachiko  felt heat rise to her cheeks.  Perhaps it was simply relief.  If they  were offended at her inaction, they didn’t show it.  Likely they  simply knew her well.  “Sachiko,” Rei smiled.  “It’s been a  while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  has,” Sachiko returned pleasantly.  “I hope you’ve been well.” <em>Gently prompt. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have, and so has Yoshino.”  She indicated the girl next to her, who <em>hmphed </em>at being spoken for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I  have indeed </em>been well, as <em>Onee-sama </em>pointed out,” she  interjected.  Rei blushed a little and shrugged, as though to say, <em>there’s no helping it, </em>and for the second time that day,  Sachiko held in a laugh.  It was a most wonderful thing to her,  though if she kept doing this, she would lose her control shortly.  “How have you been?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  even keep it in?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because  she’s not here. </em>Seemed the only valid explanation.  “I’ve  been quite well, thank you.” <em>Now tell them the happy news. Tell  them you’re engaged, and they’ll smile and congratulate me and  ask me when the wedding is and I can get back to acting. </em>“I’ve  …”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  looked at her expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  then I don’t get to see her.  Not really.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Can’t  you enjoy yourself, just this once? Let your hair down, unbutton your </em>(slut) <em>coat, have fun like a real human being? Just this once?  Who’s going to see you, but the silent butlers and Suguru? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  pained her a little to realize that she had come into this endeavor  not even planning to have fun. Not planning to enjoy herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pained  her and disgusted her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  mother would say the outside world had made her soft.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Right  now, she wasn’t sure what she’d have to say to that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  forget it.  If she was doomed to a life of taking lovers in marriage  to Suguru, of forced servitude to the beast called marriage, then why  not forget about it for just a day?  Just one little day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chosen  what I think I want to do with the rest of my life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  both seemed honestly delighted. She had never regarded herself as  directionless, any more than any other high school student, but she  got the feeling that some did, as they questioned her about her  intended major and she, having given it no more thought than was  necessary to get her mother off her back, replied as gracefully as  possible that she was still uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it? Do you know your major, or do you have a career path chosen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Both,”  she said. “I’d like to pursue a degree in Japanese literature and  composition, and become a writer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino  seemed surprised, but Rei clamped her hand over the girl’s mouth  and smiled. It was obvious that she was going to say something  important, but she held it back, only smiling.  “I think it’s  perfect,” she said.  “Absolutely perfect for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  bitter little thing in the back of her head said, <em>Why? Because I’m  the kind of girl who ought to be held in captivity for the rest of  her life? Because if I’m to be confined to a room or two, I’d  best learn how to entertain myself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>These  are my friends, you bitch. How dare you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  last surprised even Sachiko.  She said it in her head, to her  mother’s voice, and the voice abruptly vanished.  It didn’t act  shocked or offended. Simply disappeared at the slightest hint of  resistance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just  like before.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” she said quietly.  “I appreciate that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  smiled.  “It just happens that I’m doing the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This </em>surprised Sachiko.  Rei had never been any great shakes with  words or, really, with art. She was very feminine, but her taste in  books leaned very painfully towards the romantic and very painfully<em> away </em>from the well-respected.  In reality, she wasn’t that  different from Yoshino, whose tastes fell along the lines of Ikenami  Shoutarou, sports, and Akira Kurosawa.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,”  Sachiko said in a pleasant, <em>I have no idea what else to say to  that </em>tone. “Do you know what you plan to do with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“History,”  Rei said at once, as though she’d been rehearsing it.  “Literature  history fascinates me. I think I’ll probably get my doctorate, and  then go back and teach at a university.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That </em>sounded a little more like Rei.  Rei had always been an  impressive teacher—anybody on the Kendo team could have attested to  that.  Even so…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Didn’t  her parents put up a fit?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Didn’t  yours?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  still didn’t know how to deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently,  she didn’t have to.  A moment later, the doorbell rang again.  Without even having to think about it, as though informed by some  sixth sense, Sachiko’s heart leapt<br />
      <em>Yumi.</em><br />
  and  she started for the door, quickly.  She was certain that had she been  entertaining<br />
  <em>real</em><br />
  guests<br />
  <em>not  friends</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">she  would have received funny looks for moving so quickly, or, really, at  all, when she had <em>people </em>to do <em>that sort of thing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">However,  the fact remained that she <em>had </em>people to do that sort of  thing, and sometimes it seemed like they sat at the door <em>(see A/N  below) </em>waiting for people to arrive.  Maybe they did.  Sachiko,  her heart half in her belly and half in her throat, could only freeze  and pretend she hadn’t done anything at all as she heard the door  open, and the pleasant, disinterested voices of her butlers greet  somebody<br />
      <em>Yumi.</em><br />
  in  a pleasant, disinterested way that seemed to stretch on into  infinity, heaping formality after formality after formality after <em>fucking formality<br />
    a  lady is patient.<br />
    don’t  dare explode like that aloud</em><br />
  onto the  new guests.  And they, of course, were required to do the same in  return, and so Sachiko was forced to wait there, staring straight at  the door, nearly choking on her heart.  She was certain that Rei and  Yoshino were staring at her (though, in reality, they were doing  nothing of the sort: They understood how she felt better than she  could have possibly fathomed) but she felt comfortable enough around  them not to care. Or maybe she couldn’t help it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  first, the only voice returning the greetings was the one that  Sachiko most distinctly did not want to hear, the one that she didn’t  ask to attend: Sei.  “Thank you very much for inviting us into your  house,” she said.  The butler returned her pleasantry and she  retaliated, “No, don’t worry about us, we’ll just announce  ourselves. I’m nowhere near rich enough for that.” A polite  chuckle from the butler, and then, something that made her ears alive  again, tingling and electric: A light, high voice, pleasant,  restrained and yet genuine, laughing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yumi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Every  muscle in Sachiko’s body began to tug at her, to force her to move,  to scream, <em>go, go, GO TO HER. </em>Every muscle, every fiber of  her heart, body, soul, and mind.  Every synapse in her head sparked,  all spelling the same thing, except one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That one  little voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That one  little <em>f—<br />
  A  lady does not curse, not even to herself. How many times must I  remind you of that, you stupid girl?</em><br />
  That  one little voice.  The voice she called <em>mother, </em>and that her  mother called <em>breeding, </em>or perhaps <em>training</em>.  The one  that said: <em>Wait here. It won’t be much longer, and think of how  much face you’ll save.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  speaking of face, check your expression. It’s running down your  cheeks.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  on command, Sachiko straightened her face immediately, and turned to  Rei and Yoshino, who were simply waiting politely, hands folded in  their laps, eyes staring at nothing at all, not waiting, simply <em>there. </em>“I apologize for the wait,” she said, “but it  seems two more of our guestshave arrived. If you’d like a  refreshment while we wait for the final one, I would be more than  happy to get you one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door  opened, and Sachiko hadn’t ever cared about refreshments. Rei and  Yoshino didn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  voice was exactly as she remembered it, even as nervous and uncertain  as it was now.  The phone couldn’t even come close to matching it.  It never even occurred to Sachiko that the waiting had made her  half-crazy as she thought about how distorted it all seemed over that  stupid wire.  She wanted to run for Yumi, to sweep her up in her  arms, hug her, tell her how much she missed her.  She wanted to stare  into the eyes of her <em>petite soeur, </em>and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi!”  she said calmly, feigning that her delight was only a polite feint,  as she always did.  “It has been a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It…”  It was obvious, even to an untrained eye as Sachiko’s, that Yumi  was working very hard not to do what Sachiko had<br />
      <em>needed  to</em><br />
  thought  about doing. “It has.  I hope you’ve been well, <em>Onee-sama</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  smiled evenly. <em>Stop it, Yumi. Just come for me. God, I’ve  missed you. Stop it. I know I trained you to do it, but don’t  listen to me, I’m just a stupid</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have.  I’ve…” <em>Missed you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  missed you, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Yumi said as gently as she could.  She <em>was </em>learning—not two months ago, she’d have cried it  out, and dashed for Sachiko.  As of now, she simply walked quickly,  but the result was certainly the same: A moment later, Sachiko felt  Yumi’s warm body pressing up against her, and without thinking  about it, she folded her arms around the girl and <em>squeezed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yumi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  kept smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N from  above: <em>I hate playing against the Butlers. They always camp the  doors. </em></span></p>
