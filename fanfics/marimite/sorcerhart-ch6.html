<h1>The Sorceress's Heart (part 6 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a>

<a href="../marimite/sorcerhart-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p>Glossary: Seiryo Den -- The Emperor's personal residence; the name translates as the Pure 
and Fresh Palace. This is what they called it. Kicho: often translated as "screen of state," 
though there isn't really a western equivalent. The ladies of the Heian court concealed 
themselves from the gaze of men behind these screens, as one of many layers of artifice 
between the sexes, if perhaps the most tangible one. Not sure how they got into the habit in 
the first place. That must have been a weird day. Yogawa: a shrine on Mount Hiei, to the 
northeast of the city. There were many shrines, in the hills and mountains around the city, 
and the Yokibito often made pilgrimages to one or the other of them. The Japanese idea of 
religion seems to be very tied in with mountains, which seems appropriate to me.</p><hr 
size=1 noshade><p>V. A Shining Prince</p><p>The most persistent hate is that which doth 
degenerate from love.<br>-- Walter Map, Courtiers' Trifles, 245</p><p>Sachiko had seen this 
dance before, though the dancers were different each year.</p><p>Four boys and four girls. 
They were sleek and supple, nimble and quick, all of them, and their shining peach and jade 
green robes flapped and the lacquer on their fans flashed in the sun. Sachiko had no wish to 
be rude to the dancers, who had worked hard for this day, and would probably never reach 
such heights again, but she took more pleasure in watching Yumi, who was sitting next to her 
on the dais reserved for the Dragon Order and their sorores. (One of the other sorceresses 
had objected that famulae didn't really belong on the dais, but Sachiko had used her demon 
eyes, and the loud mouth had closed, in some chagrin.) It was all fresh to Yumi, and she was 
enthralled by the dancers, and by the courtyard of the Dairi, this Inner Palace section of 
the Enclosure which contained the Seiryo Den, with its orange tree and cherry tree to either 
side of the steps leading up to the Throne Hall, spreading their branches over the Emperor, 
seated in state at the top of the steps, over the dancers, and over the heads of the 
spectators, the cherry tree in glorious bloom -- it was still a little early for the orange 
tree. The excitement and joy in Yumi's expressive face was more beautiful than any dance 
Sachiko had ever seen. But when Yumi turned her head to smile delightedly at her mistress, 
Sachiko felt her heart might burst with pleasure. She took Yumi's hand surreptitiously, so 
that the clasp was mostly hidden by their robes. Together they watched as the Emperor's 
chosen dancers went around and about...</p><p>...and then were joined by a strangely 
beautiful young man, with a face sculpted of ivory. A nobleman, by his luxurious yet 
tasteful wardrobe -- a dark red silk Chinese robe with a pattern of green wistaria leaves, a 
blue underrobe visible in slender strips below the collar -- he proceeded to lead the 
dancers in the next three measures. Much absurdity is written about dance, about an art that 
so escapes language. A dancer such as this, who outdances other dancers without seeming to 
give it any thought, outdances language with yet greater ease. Let us say that this splendid 
young man was worthy in every way to lead the Emperor's chosen dancers, and leave it at 
that.</p><p>The music finished, with repeated flourishes of the lutes and zithers, and 
strikes upon the wood-blocks, and the dancers finished in gestures of supplication to the 
holiest seat in the land.</p><p>The Emperor -- his pure white robes and black lacquered 
headdress framing the face of a boy just approaching manhood -- raised one hand.</p><p>The 
dancers broke up, and a break in the ceremony was signified thereby. The Emperor turned to 
his First Chancellor, Fujiwara no Yukinaga, who raised a finger and began to pontificate, 
apparently picking up a disquisition where it had been left off.</p><p>The beautiful young 
nobleman, seeming to shine with his own light even under Heaven's sun, began walking toward 
Sachiko's party.</p><p>"He's coming <i>this way</i>!" Yoshino-chan said, with a stifled 
shriek. The shriek was echoed in many birdlike throats.</p><p>"Calm yourself, Yoshino," 
Rei-san said irritably.</p><p>Sachiko regarded the imminent paragon with more weariness than 
anything. He persisted in wanting to speak to her. Words were all he had ever wanted, from 
her. And now, even words alone were torment to her. Most of the young women in the vicinity 
seemed to be following Yoshino-chan's example of going into divine-male-induced panic. 
Sachiko grimaced. She felt tears sting the corners of her eyes. <i>No, not here. Please.</i> 
She bit her lip. And --</p><p>-- and, O Heaven, she heard Yumi gasp at her side. <i>Not her 
too,</i> she thought. <i>Not Yumi.</i> She turned her head, bracing herself for the blow to 
the heart --</p><p>-- and found Yumi looking at her, in some concern.</p><p>"Are you all 
right, Mistress?" Yumi asked. She put her other hand on Sachiko's, thus clasping it alone 
between her two. "You seemed so sad."</p><p>Sachiko was suddenly very happy. It must have 
showed in her face, because Yumi smiled; indeed, she looked about to laugh. Sachiko's other 
hand joined the tangle of feeling between the two of them.</p><p>"I was, for an instant," 
Sachiko answered. "But somehow I can't feel sad when I look at you. Yumi, do you <i>see</i> 
him?"</p><p>"See who, Mistress?"</p><p>"'Whom.' The man coming toward us. The man who 
danced."</p><p>Yumi looked at him, and then back at Sachiko. "Yes, Mistress."</p><p>"Well? 
What do you think?"</p><p>"He's a very handsome man, Mistress," Yumi said 
doubtfully.</p><p>"But you don't feel..." <i>What am I saying? It's obvious she doesn't. Why 
am I pushing? Do I</i> want <i>her to? We have here a girl apparently immune to the Shining 
One's charms. A rare bud, to be preserved against the prevailing weather at all costs.</i> 
"Never mind, Yumi," she finished.</p><p>"Good morning, my dear sir," came a carelessly 
beautiful male voice.</p><p>Squeal, moan, coo. All around her. <i>In Heaven's 
name...</i></p><p>There was Prince Suguru, standing before the little dais occupied by half 
the Dragon Order and their sorores. Sachiko glared at him. She felt oppressed by his 
handsome, smiling, impeccably-raimented person -- he was aware of this, which was doubtless 
why he was looking ostentatiously away -- and she felt oppressed by the cooing and 
fluttering of much of the Dragon Order surrounding her. The only blessed holdouts there were 
Hasekura Rei-san -- who alternated between being unwillingly moved by Suguru's beauty and 
greatly annoyed by the effect he invariably had upon Yoshino -- and Satou Sei-san, who was 
quite unmoved by his preternatural loveliness, and otherwise seemed to find him more amusing 
than anything.</p><p>Until her conversation with Yumi just now, Sachiko had always thought 
that Sei-san was unique. She didn't have to worry about Yumi in connection with Prince 
Suguru, it seemed, and now only had to be worried that Yumi and Sei-san had something in 
common.</p><p>As little as the necessity pleased her, she had to be courteous to Suguru-san. 
They were very public here. "Good morning, your highness," she said. "How pleasant to see 
you."</p><p>"An utter canard," he said lightly, "but, surrounded as we are by elegant 
fictions, it is difficult to avoid uttering fictions ourselves. I <i>am</i> pleased to see 
<i>you</i>, however; there is nothing fictional there." He was looking at her now, smiling 
down at her, all lordly charm and familial affection. "I propose to treat the Dragon Order, 
or as much of it as is here present, to ices. Does this meet with your approval, Master 
Sachiko, and the approval of the Order?" These last words were largely drowned out by a most 
energetic resurgence of cooing and fluttering, an orgiastic "yes! yes!"</p><p><i>May as well 
admit defeat,</i> Sachiko thought, but she did her best not to sound defeated: "I don't 
believe our Grand Mugwump would disapprove," she said. "By all means, let us go." She rose, 
and so did the rest of the Order, in great excitement.</p><p>--</p><p>They had to walk to 
Prince Suguru's tent, which was some distance away -- out through the Dairi gates and west 
to the Banqueting Pine Grove. He had come in full state, as always. But he always stopped 
short of upstaging the Emperor. And the Emperor returned the favor by granting him 
considerable indulgence -- few other noblemen ever had permission to set up a personal 
establishment in the Pine Grove. Well, the Emperor was an impressionable young fellow, and 
probably a bit in awe of the elegant Suguru-san. Sachiko knew the Emperor slightly; they 
were related, though not closely. A nice boy, Sachiko allowed. And awfully pretty. Really, 
the Emperor was beautiful. Almost as beautiful as Suguru-san himself... There he was, 
spearheading the march to his tent, mostly towering over a sea of flushed, upturned faces, 
chatting easily with them... Sachiko strode along, trying not to look anyone in the eye, 
trying not to sulk visibly.</p><p>She felt -- and it cheered her no end to feel them -- a 
pair of affectionate, confiding Yumi hands clasped around her upper arm, and she heard 
Yumi's soft voice in her ear, just loud enough to be heard over the rapture of the Order: 
"Why does that man call you 'sir,' Mistress?"</p><p>"One of the 'elegant fictions' he spoke 
of," Sachiko sighed. "From the beginning, the leaders of our Guild have refused to allow any 
of us to reside behind the screens of state courtly women use. At first this refusal was the 
cause of much contention. Ultimately, the court decided to just address us as men. To 
pretend we <i>were</i> men."</p><p>Yumi had a look on her face Sachiko had never seen there 
before. "But that's..." Yumi said, and stopped.</p><p>From Sachiko's other side, Sei-san 
said, "I think 'crazy' is the word you're searching for, young Yumi."</p><p>Yumi looked 
carefully at Sachiko's feet.</p><p>Sachiko sighed again. On the one hand, she didn't want 
Yumi to absorb Sei-san's disrespectful attitude toward the court, and the Good People 
generally. On the other hand, she happened to agree with Sei-san on this point. This would 
require careful navigation. "Yumi, the court has centuries of tradition behind it. These 
traditions <i>are</i> the court, in a way; the traditions, the court, the Emperor -- it all 
adds up to our national religion. Now, the way to keep ancient traditions going is to 
ignore, as far as possible, any new developments that don't harmonize well with them. So 
women who act like men have to <i>be</i> men. For the sake of tradition."</p><p>"Ah hah!" 
Sei-san cried. "Well done, Sachiko. Yes, it all makes sense now."</p><p>"But you don't act 
like a man, Mistress." Yumi was looking Sachiko in the eye again, in some 
perplexity.</p><p>"No, I don't. I am a sorceress, a woman. I practice a woman's magic. But 
as a group, we do a lot of things men traditionally do, and not 
women."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Truly! Obvious example: you've seen Sei-san and Rei-san 
handle swords. They're quite good at it, and it's not traditionally a woman's art. Not all 
sorceresses are swordhands -- I'm not -- but enough are for it to be significant. Also, and 
this is something you'll see for yourself soon, the gathering of edible plants is 
traditionally men's work. But we sorceresses do a lot of traveling in the terrible wilds -- 
much more than any of the men of the Capital -- and we don't take men along for 
plant-gathering purposes of course, or any other purposes, so we've just got into the habit 
of doing it ourselves.</p><p>"Also, we ride to the wars."</p><p>"W-we do?" Yumi clung 
tighter to Sachiko's arm. Sachiko felt a slight tremor in that arm.</p><p>"We do," Sachiko 
continued. "I've already been to Koryo once myself. I'd much rather not, personally, but 
we're men -- officially -- and we have useful powers, which is more to the point, so we're 
more or less obligated to. If we were to refuse to go, the Emperor might decide we were an 
unrewarding use of Imperial monies, more trouble than we were worth, and withdraw his 
sanction of our Guild. That wouldn't be the end of us, of course, but it <i>would</i> be 
troublesome... Oh, there are other things. It's too much to explain just now, Yumi, but you 
will always hear courtiers address us as 'sir' or 'master' or, for preference, they will 
avoid giving us any gender at all. And it's best for us to play along."</p><p>"If you say 
so, Mistress."</p><p>Yumi had a head-bowed, submissive-famula posture on. Sachiko couldn't 
be sure what Yumi was thinking when she did that. "We can talk about it more later, Yumi. 
It's all right if it sounds... a bit strange... to you --"</p><p>"Barking mad," Sei-san 
murmured.</p><p>Sachiko glowered at Sei-san, then turned back to Yumi with a gentler look. 
"Just don't say so to anyone else. All right?"</p><p>"Probably good advice," said Prince 
Suguru.</p><p>Sachiko managed not to jump. He had surprised her, and she suspected he knew 
it, but if she showed surprise he'd gain points --</p><p>"Who <i>is</i> this charming young 
gentleman?" Suguru-san wondered, gazing benignly down upon Yumi. Yumi looked back up at him 
with deep skepticism.</p><p>"He is Nanashi Yumi-kun, your Imperial Highness," Sei-san said, 
sketching a bow. "Sachiko's brand new soror -- excuse me, 'frater'! -- mystica, or mystico, 
or something. I'll give you fair warning; he's a <i>bit</i> more girly than the sort of 
charming young gentleman you normally consort with, your 
splendiferousness."</p><p>"<i>You</i> still have not learnt to behave yourself, I see." 
Suguru-san spoke to Sei-san without looking at her. He kept his gentle, arresting gaze on 
Yumi, who merely looked back at him and continued to hold onto Sachiko.</p><p>Sei-san chose 
to respond to Suguru-san's snub by walking close to him -- impolitely close, so that her 
robes, indeed her legs, were brushing his. "I choose to work toward the goals I set for 
myself," she said chattily, "rather than the goals other people set for me. For example, if 
I were to suggest that you spend too much money on silk scarves, you would hardly adjust 
your annual budget according to my suggestion, would you?"</p><p>Suguru-san seemed set on 
ignoring Sei-san's determined co-ambulation with him. "Your aspect is most pleasing. Of what 
family are you?" he asked Yumi, as if Sei-san had not spoken.</p><p>"Sachiko-sama's," was 
all Yumi said. She looked him in the eye when she said it, though.</p><p>"Or, to take 
another example, if the head of our Order were to suggest that you ought to donate your 
palace to us for combat exercises, and feed us at the end of the day, you'd be inclined to 
tell her to lump it, wouldn't you?"</p><p>"Indeed?" One of Suguru-san's exquisitely crafted 
eyebrows went up. "Sacchan has a cousin called Touko-chan. I know Sacchan's family quite 
well, being a member of it, and I don't recall hearing of you before now."</p><p>Sachiko had 
told Yumi to say she was an Ogasawara cousin, if anyone asked. The easiest, most sensible 
excuse -- provided it wasn't used on someone who knew Sachiko's family tree from back to 
front. It was time to step in. "And yet, she <i>is</i> my family, in a way," Sachiko said. 
"She is my famula, and will soon be my soror mystica. And I will thank you to stop quizzing 
her in that disrespectful fashion."</p><p>"Sacchan! Sacchan! No disrespect was intended, I 
assure -- urgh!" Suguru-san stumbled, righted himself, and turned quickly. "You damned 
knave, will you quit walking so close to me?"</p><p><i>He used rough language, and he</i> 
nearly <i>raised his voice,</i> Sachiko thought. <i>Well done, Sei-san.</i></p><p>"Oh, sorry 
about that, o shiny one," Sei-san said, looking more gleeful than sorry. "I think your 
perfume made me a bit dizzy. Everyone! Be careful not to walk too close to his Highness! If 
you put a foot wrong he might chip a toenail, and what a sodding nightmare that would 
be!"</p><p>A couple of sorceresses walking nearby gasped. One said "Sei-sama! How 
rude!"</p><p>"Sei-san --" Sachiko began, knowing it was no use.</p><p>"Your concern for my 
accoutrements is entirely charming," Suguru-san said to Sei-san, smiling wickedly, 
"especially given that you seem to have no concern for your own. You dress like a 
highwayman. And you wish to be taken for a woman?"</p><p>"I wish not to be taken at all," 
Sei-san rejoined with an easy grin of her own, "which is why I do things to my own 
specifications rather than yours. And really, if a man of your stamp suggests that I am 
unwomanly, what cause have I to repine?"</p><p>"A man of my 'stamp'?" Suguru-san's tone in 
response was only mildly antagonistic, giving the impression that he was refuting a 
philosophical argument rather than fending off a personal attack. "What do you endeavor to 
suggest by such a remark? I suppose I have the same qualifications for pronouncing on such 
matters as any man. Convince me otherwise!"</p><p>"Oh! Well. You think your qualifications 
<i>that</i> good? Daresay you're right." Sei-san smirked, made an odd stroking motion in 
midair with her curled right hand, and then buffed her nails on the front of her tunic. 
"Pronounce away, if it gives you pleasure. Pronounce yourself raw. Meanwhile, I'll do what 
pleases me."</p><p>They had arrived at the pavilion. Suguru-san said, "What a fascinating 
conversation, my man. We must continue it another day." And he clapped his hands together 
twice, briskly: "Ices!"</p><p>Three beautiful young men wearing servants' tunics with 
striking red sashes leapt to their feet -- they had been sitting on the grass and apparently 
playing an impromptu game of Go with pebbles and twigs -- opened baskets and proceeded to 
serve out ices.</p><p>Yoshino-chan came to Yumi, talking excitedly about liana syrup. Yumi 
gave Sachiko a questioning look, and Sachiko gave Yumi a smile and a gentle shove in 
Yoshino-chan's direction. Deep down, she <i>didn't</i> much like surrendering Yumi to 
someone else, but -- she'd watched Yumi talking to Yoshino-chan. Yoshino-chan's company made 
Yumi happy in a way Sachiko hadn't seen her, otherwise.</p><p>The ultimate sacrifice, for 
Yumi's sake. Now she was stuck with Suguru-san, and a beaming Sei-san just over the horizon. 
Sachiko allowed herself to indulge for a moment in the sweet sorrow of 
renunciation.</p><p>"Sacchan," Suguru-san said, in as close as he got to a complaining tone, 
"whenever I see you these days, it seems to require me to also consort with that 
bounder."</p><p>"Bounder," came an amused murmur from nearby.</p><p>"A female bounder is a 
novel experience without question, but it cannot be called an amiable one. Is it really 
necessary for you to have the creature always about you?"</p><p>"Creature," came the murmur 
again.</p><p>"She is my friend," Sachiko said.</p><p>Those heartbreakingly lovely eyebrows 
of his were arched high. "And you approve of all she does?"</p><p>"No. But I don't have to. 
As long as we're relatively private here, I may as well ask you why you speak to me 
anyway?"</p><p>"Do I have to have a reason? We are bound together, you and I. You know how 
many ties as well as I or better. What reason do I need, beyond these?"</p><p>"You get 
nothing out of it, except your ghastly entertainment," said Sachiko. "And I get nothing at 
all except pain and confusion. I would be immensely gratified if you would stop."</p><p>"You 
don't answer your parents' letters," Suguru-san said.</p><p>A sudden change of subject. As 
it was one of Sachiko's own little vices -- she and Suguru-san had much more in common than 
she liked to think about -- she couldn't really complain. "Nonsense. I answer every letter. 
They wrote me last week, and I sent a reply the next day."</p><p>"You send back cheap paper 
with expensive writing on it, but you don't answer the one question they're really asking 
you: when are you coming home?"</p><p>"You have been talking with my father, I think." 
Sachiko was speaking very calmly, in spite of the rage building within her. "He talks about 
how expensive my writing is. He admittedly paid a fairly large sum three years back to 
establish me at the Guild. He has sent no other money since, but he talks as if I am always 
taking money from him."</p><p>"And you haven't answered <i>me,</i> either," Suguru-san said, 
giving her an admonishing look. "We are your family, your father and I. Sooner or later, you 
have to give us an accounting of yourself."</p><p>"Yes. The Ogasawara family ideal. I have 
always studied to accommodate it. I will give you my answer now, my lord prince. You may 
pass it along to my father, and I pray it will content you both. I do not propose to come 
home any time soon. What I <i>do</i> propose to do, very soon now, is refund my father the 
Guild monies he put up for me."</p><p>"Sacchan!..."</p><p>Suguru-san looked appalled. And it 
wasn't often that Sachiko caught that sort of uncertainty on his face. She felt triumphant. 
"Yes. And then he can stop complaining about how expensive my writing is."</p><p>"Sacchan... 
This is going too far, really." He was controlling himself now, looking carefully anywhere 
but at her. "For you to think that you could buy off your father, as if he were a crude 
extortionist --"</p><p>"He is <i>my</i> father. I find the idea less surprising than you 
seem to."</p><p>"Sacchan..."</p><p>"He really spent very little on me before I came to the 
Guild -- not nearly as much as he spends on entertaining guests, and his women -- but of 
course it is impertinent in a daughter to think that she ought to be as important to a 
father as a guest in his home, or a whore in his bed. We can negotiate, and if I think his 
demands fair, I will work to raise another sum, though 'twill be a lesser one than the 
first. And I will raise it, for as young as I am, my skills are in demand, in some quarters. 
And I will pay, and he and I will be done."</p><p>"Sacchan, this is 
<i>childish</i>."</p><p>"Childish?" came the mocking voice from behind him, and he spun to 
confront the speaker. "She's offering to pay her debts. Sounds pretty grown-up to 
me."</p><p>"How dare you interfere in a private conversation between your betters!" 
Suguru-san was shaking with rage.</p><p>"I am a sorceress," Sei-san said, unfazed. "I have 
no <i>betters</i>. A prince should know what power means." She pointed a finger, but kept 
her voice level. "And it's not for you to say who's allowed to talk, and who isn't. Not your 
job."</p><p>"You seem very sure of all this." Suguru-san had gone all calm again. "Greater 
authorities than either you or I have set different precedents, of course. Is there any way 
I can convince you to at least find out what they had to say, as opposed to spending all 
your time in your own dream world?"</p><p>"If you can beat me two falls out of three, I'll 
consider it," Sei-san said. She was still smiling but her eyes were deadly 
serious.</p><p>Suguru-san looked back at her, motionless for a moment, then said, "You are a 
savage," and turned back to his cousin. "Sachiko, family ties bind too tightly, and blood 
runs too deep. Your connection with your family cannot be erased with money. That <i>is</i> 
childish, a fantasy, and I am shocked that you could think it possible. Please tell me that 
you are overtired, or that your inexplicable antipathy for me has caused you to lose your 
temper, to say too much --"</p><p>Sachiko was unutterably weary, suddenly; weary of 
everything, especially of Sei-san and Suguru-san, and herself. The one person she wasn't 
weary of was off with Yoshino-chan having ices, and Sachiko wished she were with them. She 
wasn't overtired -- she had actually slept quite well last night, with her nice clean little 
fox snuggled against her -- but she <i>had</i> lost her temper, and she <i>had</i> said too 
much. She had blabbed her plans to her mortal enemy, in the hope of making him lose his 
sangfroid, his hideous conviction of his own rightness, and that <i>was</i> childish 
stupidity. The stupidest. "Yes," she said. "Yes, it's true. I lost my temper and I said too 
much. I have no intention of attempting to buy myself from my father, to purchase my freedom 
from his tyranny. It's all lies and fustian, an expression of my inexplicable -- inex --" 
She couldn't go on. Her throat had closed, it seemed. To speak of her hatred was to speak of 
her love, and to speak of her love was to put her death in his hands.</p><p>She had 
natheless said enough to make him angry. His eyes were flashing, and those ravishing slim 
white hands were turning clawlike. "Why do you insist upon --"</p><p>And then, a miracle 
shone through the mists.</p><p>"Master Sachiko, I greet you in the name of the Emperor," 
said a new voice. There was a man bowing at her, a middle-aged man in purple robes. Sachiko 
vaguely recognized him as the current Chief Constable of the City of the Right. As far as 
she knew, the position was hereditary. "His Majesty requests your presence at the main 
pavilion," the man drawled in easy, uninquisitive tones. "He wishes to consult with you and 
your colleagues on a matter of some importance."</p><p>"Thank you for your diligence," 
Sachiko told the man absently, though her heart was singing. Leaving Suguru-san to stew 
while she went to advise the Emperor would be pure pleasure. She debated for a moment about 
bringing Yumi, but...there she was, with Yoshino-chan and some other Ox- and Rat-level 
sorceresses. She was one of the group. They were eating ices, talking and laughing, having 
the time of their lives... No. She turned to Sei-san, who was looking right at her. 
"Sei-san, if Yumi wonders where I am, will you tell her I'll return soon?"</p><p>"Gladly," 
Sei-san said. "I'll keep an eye on her, Sachiko."</p><p>"Thank you," Sachiko said, as 
thankfully as she could manage, and she went.</p><p>--</p><p>Suguru had stalked off 
immediately Sachiko had departed, without a word to Sei. <i>I will bear the desolation 
somehow,</i> Sei thought, and looked about her. The younger ones were having a lovely time 
over there. Yumi seemed to be really popular. Well, she was pretty, and she had a sweet 
disposition, but Sei suspected that her proximity to Sachiko made up a large part of her 
magnetism. Sachiko fascinated everybody -- even Sei, and Sei was usually bored by the 
nobility. But then, Sei lived with Sachiko. Youko had entrusted Sachiko to her three years 
ago, saying "Look after her," and Sei had done her best. She had watched as Sachiko slowly 
moved away from home, in her head, and in her heart; as Miss Hoity-Toity had gradually 
dropped the Hoity and the Toity, and learned more about people. She still had blind spots, 
many of them. But most importantly, she had ceased to be certain of her own rightness, and 
the rightness of her upbringing. Paradoxically, in flight from her upbringing, in rebellion 
against it, she had still clung to it; it was all she had known.</p><p>Sei knew about that. 
Sei knew how difficult it could be to move away from home for good, though she and Sachiko 
had had to move in different directions to wind up in the same place. And Sei, of course, 
had traveled a much greater distance geographically, if not spiritually...</p><p>She thought 
about going over there to join Yumi and Yoshino, and decided that it wouldn't do. Yoshino 
and the others wouldn't mind her being there -- though juniors were always self-conscious 
around seniors, especially a senior with such a reputation as Sei had. (And of course every 
single girl over there had a mistress already, or she wouldn't be here today -- oh yes, and 
Sei had a soror mystica, for certain.) But Yumi was still uneasy around Sei, and suspicious 
of her. And the little darling was having such a good time it would be a sin to destroy it. 
Look at her: no longer clinging to Yoshino as the only familiar face in a sea of strangers, 
she and two girls Sei didn't know were playing at throwing ice in the air and catching it in 
their mouths.</p><p>Yoshino, for her part, was chatting with two of the sleek young men 
who'd served the ices; there was a lot of grinning and foot-shuffling going on. Rei was 
nowhere in sight. That was an old story. It was painful for Rei to watch Yoshino mingling 
with the opposite sex, but she was unwilling to interfere with Yoshino's pleasures, so she 
would take herself off somewhere. A poor policy -- oh, there wasn't much danger <i>here</i>, 
but Rei obviously hadn't ever been lectured by noisy red-faced loving parents about the 
dreadful things that could happen to young women who mingled with men unaccompanied 
--</p><p>"Mistress?"</p><p>Sei turned, but knew from the voice, and of course the form of 
address, who would be there. Her gaze fell upon a face she still, after three months of 
knowing it, regarded as the most beautiful she had ever seen, save one.</p><p>"Oi, Shimako," 
she said cheerfully.</p><p>--</p><p>Sachiko entered the front room of the Jijuden, the 
Emperor's personal lodge just north of the Throne Hall, and came into the Presence warily. 
She saw that Youko-sama and Fujiwara-dono were already there -- oh, and there was Suga-sama 
coming in, in all her splendour; apparently she'd been summoned as well. She was doing her 
very best not to acknowledge Sachiko's presence, or at least no more than was necessary in 
pushing past her to greet the Emperor first.</p><p>Sachiko was more amused than offended by 
this now, though such had not always been the case. Suga-sama's antics were legendary in the 
Guild. She had come of a servant family, but had managed to work her way up not only in the 
Sorceress's Guild, but in courtly circles as well -- not an ordinary achievement, give her 
credit. She had many highly-placed contacts in Government, and was very useful to the Guild 
that way, from all Sachiko heard. She had seemed to resent Sachiko, for some reason, from 
the day Sachiko had first arrived in the Guild, and she had always been Sachiko's least 
pleasant teacher. But Sachiko had long since learned that as long as she was properly 
respectful to Suga-sama, and kept her own nose clean, there was no way Suga-sama could 
really damage her.</p><p>She waited for Suga-sama to finish her greetings, which were 
elaborate and ceremonious to a degree consonant with Suga-sama's notion of her own 
importance.</p><p>When this was over at last, Sachiko advanced the requisite distance, 
knelt, and bowed low.</p><p>"Rise," the Emperor husked, in a voice that was still working 
its way toward manhood.</p><p>"Hullo, Ogasawara-kun," said Fujiwara-dono. "I'm a bit 
surprised you're here without your pet."</p><p>"She's having a good time, Fujiwara-dono," 
Sachiko said evenly. "I didn't want to drag her away." She felt some resentment at hearing 
Yumi referred to as her "pet," but she couldn't resent it publicly, in front of the Emperor. 
Anyway, if she showed yet more insolence to Fujiwara-dono, after yesterday, Youko-sama would 
probably send her to bed without any supper.</p><p>"Your pet?" the Emperor asked, in a tone 
of friendly inquiry.</p><p>Sachiko had always found that, when a subject came up which one 
did not wish to discuss in present company, a fully responsive yet not very exciting answer 
was best. "My servant -- my student, in truth," Sachiko said. "A charming young person, your 
majesty. The young students are currently disporting themselves at Prince Suguru's 
pavilion." She sent Youko-sama an inquiring look. Youko-sama shrugged 
philosophically.</p><p>"Oh! You have an imouto, Sacchan?"</p><p>Sachiko <i>knew</i> that 
voice. She sent an astonished glare in its direction. And there, stepping in through the 
wide entrance to the main chamber, was a very familiar young woman, only a year or two older 
than Sachiko herself. One she had not expected to see again any time 
soon.</p><p>"Eriko-sama!" she breathed.</p><p>"<i>Good</i> to see you again, honey," said 
Torii Eriko-sama happily, walking up to Sachiko. "I understand you've done quite well for 
yourself. Distinguished yourself in southern Honshu over the winter, and promoted to Dragon 
Level. Well done! We expect great things of you, Sacchan. And I'm sure Youko's very proud of 
you!"</p><p>"Eriko-sama, I thought you had married."</p><p>"Do you know, I <i>had</i>?" 
Eriko-sama answered chirpily. "Can we talk about something else, please?"</p><p>Sachiko's 
eyes narrowed, and her mind moved very swiftly. The wedding had been in the autumn of last 
year, to a well-to-do artisan, a maker of umbrellas -- a very odd choice, given Eriko-sama's 
lineage: a warrior family with aspirations to gentility. Eriko-sama was somewhat 
over-fathered and over-brothered, and it was a charming miracle that her intended had 
survived the courtship. Eriko-sama had been blooming at the wedding, dressed in twenty 
robes, all in different bright colors, her hair unbound, freed. Then there had been nothing 
for months, and they had all assumed she was happily married. <i>Now she turns up at the 
Spring Dance without warning, her hair done up under a headband as of old, dressed in 
sorceress's robes once again, but now done entirely in black -- dusty black leather for her 
outer cloak, shiny black silk for her inner robe, deep and opaque. Hm. Not her usual 
rig-out, from what I can remember. And she's smiling a bit over-pleasantly, and doesn't want 
to discuss her marriage.</i> Also, behind Eriko-sama, there was Youko-sama shaking her head 
at Sachiko vigorously, and Fujiwara-dono drawing lots of lines across her throat with her 
fingers and making sharp little whistling noises.</p><p>All this passed through Sachiko's 
mind in a winking.</p><p>"Of course, Eriko-sama," Sachiko said pleasantly. "I'm sure there 
are all sorts of other things to discuss."</p><p>"Indeed!" Eriko-sama said. "It's a big 
world, after all. No end of other things to talk about! Oh, and you've been summoned for a 
particular purpose, haven't you? I'm interrupting! I <i>am</i> sorry, your Imperial 
Majesty," Eriko-sama said, turning to the Emperor.</p><p>"Not at all," he said quickly. "Er, 
just one question, Torii-san -- why black?"</p><p>"Because it is the color of night, and the 
banner of the destructive forces that wage perpetual warfare against all hope and happiness, 
your Imperial Majesty," Eriko-sama said with a sweet, charming smile. "I thought it 
appropriate."</p><p>Fujiwara-dono was now trying to catch the Emperor's eye, her lips moving 
vehemently yet issuing no sound, and the lines across her throat had been abandoned in favor 
of great slashing gestures in midair. Youko-sama had buried her face in her hands.</p><p>"I 
see," the Emperor said, nodding. Then he shook his head, and then he nodded again. Then he 
stared at Fujiwara-dono, and then he cleared his throat. Sachiko felt some sympathy with 
him. Plainly it was proving to be a challenging day. "Er -- well. Well, to business, 
Auntie."</p><p>Suga-sama sent the Emperor a cool look, with one speculative eyebrow raised, 
but of course said nothing.</p><p>"Yes, your Majesty," Fujiwara-dono said, resuming her 
ordinary decorum. "To business, Mizuno-san."</p><p>"Yes, Fujiwara-dono," Youko-sama said. 
"Sachiko, please come closer."</p><p>Sachiko walked toward the throne. She took slow, 
measured steps. She opened her pouch. She met Youko-sama's eye.</p><p>Youko-sama nodded, 
very slightly.</p><p>Sachiko reached into her pouch, and brought out the shining golden 
thing.</p><p>No-one spoke for a few moments.</p><p>"Put it away, Sachiko," Youko said at 
last, and Sachiko complied.</p><p>Although the object was no longer visible, some of the 
golden light it had shed still lingered on the Emperor's face. It shifted, this way and 
that, playing over his whole face -- including his eyes, and yet he seemed unaware of it. He 
was aware, after a few moments, that everyone was staring at him.</p><p>"Have I got 
something on my nose?" he inquired nervously.</p><p>Fujiwara-dono waved a hand. The light 
left the Emperor's face; as it did so, he tried to make a minute examination of it, but 
succeeded only in crossing his eyes.</p><p>It danced sadly for them in midair, for a few 
moments, and was gone.</p><p>"It's never done that before," Sachiko said.</p><p>"Does it 
have some significance?" the Emperor wondered, still staring at the place where the light 
had vanished for good.</p><p>"Difficult to say," Fujiwara-dono said, in a musing tone, 
looking at the same place.</p><p>"No doubt it was a mark of favor," Suga-sama said. "Wishing 
the Emperor a long and prosperous reign."</p><p>Sachiko wondered about that, in the silence 
that followed. That tone of voice from Fujiwara-dono seldom boded well. Youko-sama had once 
described it as the tone she got when there were a number of thoughts running through her 
mind and she didn't like the look of any of them.</p><p>--</p><p>"So are you ready for the 
Questioning?" Sei asked her imouto.</p><p>"As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose," was her 
lugubrious answer.</p><p>"Hath courage run aground, dear heart?"</p><p>Shimako turned those 
sweetly ethereal eyes fully on her, and Sei sighed a little. "It's just -- I've heard you 
and Sachiko-sama and Rei-sama talk about it, and from what you <i>say</i>, it doesn't sound 
too hard -- the actual business of talking to the Divine One is left to the Guild leader 
there present and the Grand Mugwump of the Dragon Order. And the rest of us just have to 
sing, as odd as that sounds. But from the <i>tone</i> of what you say, there's more to it 
than that..."</p><p>"There <i>is</i> more to it than that, especially this year. Trouble is, 
we don't know just what that more will be. Bad, good, indifferent? The high council's out to 
lunch. So we don't talk about it a lot."</p><p>"What exactly is it you're not talking about 
a lot, Sei?"</p><p>"I can't tell you, I'm afraid. You happen to be close to the four dragons 
-- Sachiko, Rei, Youko, myself -- who know anything about it at all, so I guess you've had 
more opportunity to put two and two together than most. But we've all been sworn to secrecy 
by Fujiwara-dono. So we can't discuss it. Understood?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So what will you 
do?" Sei grinned.</p><p>Shimako put a hand on Sei's arm. "Trust you and wait."</p><p>Sei 
loved that about Shimako. If it had been anyone else asking, Sei would have used such verbal 
footwork and legerdemain, such sleights and sophistries as would make a missionary blush. 
Shimako was smart enough not to fall for any of that. But Shimako was also smart enough to 
know that if it was something she really needed to know, for her safety, then Sei would tell 
her and damn secrecy.</p><p>Sei just wished she could have the same certainty about the 
higher-ups... she was pretty sure Fujiwara-dono wouldn't lead them wrong, but was less sure 
of the seldom-visible Shonagon-sama, and with Suga-sama it was almost a joke -- Suga-sama 
might avoid telling <i>herself</i> the truth, if the truth happened to be inconvenient to 
her...</p><p>"How did you find me?" Sei asked, longing for a change of subject. "You just 
got here, didn't you?"</p><p>"Yes. I was sorry to miss the Dance. But I heard a voice, a 
portent ringing out clearly in the morning mists: 'Sei-san! How rude!' I was fairly sure I 
knew which Sei-san was so portented, and so I followed the sound."</p><p>"You know me so 
well!" Sei said happily, draping an affectionate arm around Shimako's shoulders. "Look, the 
Mountain Lily Gang has a new member, and I think you ought to meet her. She's completely new 
to the fancy, and I'm sure she'd benefit from your advice. She's right over there -- " She 
indicated the scrum by the refreshment baskets.</p><p>"Really? Which one is she?" Shimako 
was looking eagerly.</p><p>"She...she's...gone," Sei said.</p><p>"Oh. Oh, dear. Well, 
perhaps another time --"</p><p>"<i>No</i>," Sei said, a little too loudly. "She 
<i>shouldn't</i> be gone. And, damn her hide, <i>Yoshino's</i> gone as well. <i>She</i> 
shouldn't be gone."</p><p>"What, isn't Rei-sama with her?"</p><p>"No, Yoshino was talking to 
boys. You know what that does to Rei. The little alley-cat --" Sei trailed 
off.</p><p>"Suguru," she said a moment later.</p><p>The Shining One had vanished as 
well.</p><p>That was enough. That was about the limit. Sei ran briefly, and then was 
fighting her way through the frolicking juniors, a bit overenthusiastically. One of the ice 
baskets got in her way, and she kicked it vehemently -- "Filthy luxury!" she roared -- and 
thus all three ice baskets capsized and several liana bowls became airborne, spraying cold 
water and bits of ice and sticky, suddenly-no-longer-elegant syrup everywhere. There was 
much shrieking and wailing among the younger sorceresses, who of course had all got dressed 
up in their best for this festive occasion. There was a panicked stampede, and the tent was 
empty in moments except for Shimako, Sei, and one girl Sei had managed to pluck out of the 
mass exodus, recognizing her as one of the girls she'd seen playing at ice-toss with Yumi. 
"Oi! You! Girl!"</p><p>"Crazy!" the girl squealed. "You've gone crazy, 
Sei-sama!"</p><p>"Crazy like a FOX!" Sei said much too loudly, taking the girl gently by the 
collar and lifting her up on tip-toes. "Where is Yumi, damn your eyes?"</p><p>The girl burst 
into tears.</p><p>"Well, what the --" Sei spluttered. "Now as Christ is my witness, I 
--"</p><p>"Sei, she doesn't know from God or Christ; she's a Buddhist," Shimako said calmly. 
"Let me talk to her. Will you let her down, please?"</p><p>"Sure," Sei said, dropping the 
girl. Sei was a bit unnerved.</p><p>Shimako steadied the girl and sat her down on a bench. 
"There, there. My Mistress didn't mean anything by it... Well, I suppose she did mean 
something by it, but she didn't mean to frighten you..."</p><p>There was a brief interval, 
in which Shimako comforted the weeping girl, and Sei paced. <i>Calm, calm. It's not 
Shimako's fault, it's not this girl's fault. Prince Suguru has got the better of you. 
That's</i> your <i>fault...</i></p><p>True. But this was taking too much time. Sei looked at 
the weeping girl. Apart from the fact that her nose was running, she was somewhat fetching. 
And she had a scar on one cheek, so Sei felt some kinship with her. Another approach 
occurred to her. With a glance at Shimako, she sat down on the girl's other side. "I'm 
sorry," she said. "Will you listen, now? I'm sorry."</p><p>The girl looked at her 
reproachfully. Her face was a mess of tears. Sei put an arm around the girl's shoulders. 
"What's your name, little sister?"</p><p>Shimako arched an eyebrow. Sei paid her no 
heed.</p><p>"Sadako," the girl whispered.</p><p>Sei used the edge of one sleeve to dry 
Sadako's face. She was as gentle and tender as she knew how to be. She even sang a little as 
she dried, looking intently into Sadako's eyes. The girl couldn't have understood the words, 
they were in a faraway tongue, but they seemed still to soothe her:</p><p>In the oncoming 
morning I'll be bidding adieu<br>To Leitrim, Drumshanbo and sweet Carrick too;<br>But no 
matter what fortunes I may seek far away,<br>My thoughts will be with you by night and by 
day.</p><p>No more will I ramble round Hartnett's green hills.<br>And the place I love 
dearest is down by the mill;<br>Its great fertile valley where oft times I ran<br>And felt 
the fresh breezes round the shores of Lough Bran.</p><p>"A little better now, sweeting?" Sei 
asked gently.</p><p>The girl nodded. She looked almost sleepy.</p><p>"You were playing with 
a friend of mine, a short while ago. Yumi. I'm sorry I spoke so roughly to you, Sadako-chan, 
but I need to find her. I'm responsible for her, and I'm a little worried that she's just 
disappeared like this. Do you have any notion of where she might have gone?"</p><p>"She went 
with Prince Suguru," Sadako said. She looked a bit woozy.</p><p>"With Suguru?" Sei was on 
the point of exploding again, but controlled herself. "That's what I <i>thought</i> she 
might have done, but I couldn't believe it. Why would she go with Suguru?" <i>What in the 
world would Suguru want with her?</i></p><p>"I'm sorry, Sei-sama, but I didn't know," Sadako 
answered. She was looking fixedly up into Sei's eyes. "I didn't want her to go. I don't have 
many friends, and Yumi-san is very nice. The prince said he had something important to talk 
to her about, and that it concerned Sachiko-sama. She nodded, told me she'd be a few 
minutes, and went with him. They went that way," she added, pointing slightly west of south, 
but still not taking her eyes off Sei. "Toward the gardens."</p><p>"Thank you, sweetheart," 
Sei said. "You've done me a service. I must do you a service some time. Remind me!" Sei 
patted the girls' shoulders, and stood. "Now, where'd <i>Shimako</i> get to? This just gets 
better and better. Never mind --" She began hurrying toward the gardens...</p><p>Sadako 
started to follow her, and stopped. Then she just stood and watched her 
go.</p><p>--</p><p>"The warrior families are a growing problem," Suga-sama was saying. "If 
we in the Sorceress's Guild are to hold any kind of balance, we must have all our awe and 
prestige intact. Our powers are key, and no one might take our powers from us, at all 
events. But also of importance is our connection with Amaterako-sama. And that is in large 
part embodied in the object Ogasawara-kun showed you a few minutes ago."</p><p>"You've been 
presenting it to her every year," the Emperor said. "Correct?"</p><p>"Correct," said 
Fujiwara-dono.</p><p>"And every year she gives it back at the end of the 
Questioning?"</p><p>"Such has always been the case." Suga-sama nodded.</p><p>"Why is it 
necessary for you to go through that rigamarole every spring?" said the Emperor in an almost 
offensively reasonable tone of voice. "I mean to say. If she wants it, let her keep it. If 
she doesn't want it, you can keep it."</p><p>"An interesting point of view, Toru-chan," 
Fujiwara-dono said, in a very similar tone. "Immensely practical. Tell me...that dance we 
all watched a little while ago, with great delight, I'm sure. Is it really necessary? I mean 
some person or persons in your court goes to tremendous trouble every year to scour the 
country for dancers. Heaven forbid you saw the same dancer two years in a row 
--"</p><p>"Yes, yes, Oba-san," the Emperor interrupted hurriedly. "You are quite right, of 
course, and I withdraw the question. So. She has always given it back at the end of the 
Questioning. But last year --"</p><p>"Last year was different," mused Fujiwara-dono. "She 
held it longer, at the last, looked at it longer, and as she handed it back to Amaya-kun, 
she spoke to it, saying "Next year you come home to me."</p><p>"What did she mean by 
that?"</p><p>"Probably exactly what she said. This will be the last year we can carry this 
object as an offering. It may be about to hatch. But just what the outcome or upshot will 
be, I don't know."</p><p>"And you bring this up --"</p><p>"We will need a new object for the 
offering, next year. If we are to preserve our necessary status, as Suga-sama just 
explained. I have my eye on one which ought to meet with Amaterako-sama's approval. But it 
will be expensive --"</p><p>"And that is the reason of the preposterous sum you have 
requested?"</p><p>Suga-sama spoke up. "I assure you, my Emperor, Fujiwara-dono has not 
exaggerated in the slightest. It will be a great expenditure, but quite necessary 
--"</p><p>Fujiwara-dono held a gentle finger up, her eyes narrowing. "It was thy nuncle told 
thee 'twas a preposterous sum, warn't it?"</p><p>"Well --" The Emperor blushed a 
bit.</p><p>"Yuki-chan is good at minding the purse-strings, all right. But tell him this 
from me: if he wants to continue to call upon our services in time of war..."</p><p>"Auntie, 
you would refuse your duty?" The Emperor was looking at her wide-eyed.</p><p>"Not happily, 
Toru-chan. But if we cannot bring her the offering each year, she may well turn her face 
away from us for good. If that happens, it will be difficult for us to --"</p><p>"Pardon -- 
intrusion!" A young sorceress, out of breath, had rushed into the room from the darkening 
day. She was dripping wet and the front of her robes looked slimy, almost as if they had 
taken a direct hit from a big blob of liana syrup.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" the 
Emperor inquired with stern formality, his voice cracking on the first syllable of 
"meaning."</p><p>"I beg your forgiveness, your Imperial Majesty. Fujiwara-dono -- chaos and 
discord at Prince Suguru's tent, in the Pine Grove -- violence -- ice-baskets overturned -- 
newbies in tears -- Satou Sei-sama has run mad --"</p><p>"What!" Youko stepped forward 
quickly.</p><p>"Calmly, calmly, my pet," Fujiwara-dono said, taking the girl's hand. 
"Watanabe-kun, is it not?"</p><p>"Y-yes, Fujiwara-dono --"</p><p>"And what do you say to the 
day, little one? A beautiful Dance, eh? Did you have fun at Prince Suguru's 
tent?"</p><p>"Yes -- a lovely time, Fujiwara-dono -- UNTIL --" Watanabe-kun screwed up her 
face, as if warding off tears.</p><p>"Why has Satou-san run mad, then? Any 
notion?"</p><p>"She said -- she'd lost someone she was supposed to be looking after, and 
--"</p><p>There was a rustle and a flash of azure silk robes, and Sachiko was 
gone.</p><p>"Now -- now what in the tarnation --" the Emperor was very curious to 
know.</p><p>--</p><p>Hasekura Rei had been having a lovely day until <i>he'd</i> shown 
up.</p><p>Truthfully, Prince Suguru had never seemed much of a direct threat. He'd never 
pursued Yoshino, not even in a momentary fashion. Maybe she was too young for him, or not 
sufficiently a lady, or something. This never seemed to discourage Yoshino at all, however. 
Walking to the Prince's tent, she'd been in the cluster of rats and young oxen closest to 
him. Rei had been utterly forgotten, and left to wander the earth alone for the rest of her 
days, trailing along behind, eating her own heart... She <i>would</i> keep telling herself 
not to be overdramatic, of course. Yoshino had done this sort of thing before -- with Prince 
Suguru, and with other beautiful noblemen -- though no other noblemen were quite on the same 
level as Suguru, curse him. Indeed, for a short while, Yoshino had had a crush on Emperor 
Rokutoru, had called him "the adorable Emperor-chan," and so on.</p><p>But she had always 
come back to Rei in the end, so she would this time too. Wouldn't she?...</p><p>Things had 
got worse in Prince Suguru's tent. His serving-boys were nearly as pretty as he was, and not 
nearly as standoffish. Rei actually heard them talking to Yoshino about fishing, of all 
things. About what expert fishermen they were. And Yoshino, who had often fished and caught 
dinner for the whole Gang when they were traveling, had listened to them attentively, 
ooh-ing and aah-ing all the while, the little fraud.</p><p>Rei had almost been able to see 
the boys' thoughts, serving boys unencumbered by the courtly need to see the sorceresses as 
strangely shaped men: <i>Here's a girl who doesn't hide herself behind a screen. An</i> easy 
<i>girl...</i></p><p>It was too much. Rei had gone for a walk.</p><p>The conversation, more 
than an argument, almost a war, which Rei had with herself on this walk, is best not 
recorded. She went around and around in her own head, cursing herself for a fool, and 
pleading with herself not to be so hard-hearted. Let Yoshino have her fun, she had pleaded 
with herself. As long as she comes back to me at the end of the day, I don't mind where she 
goes for lunch, do I?</p><p><i>Don't you?</i> herself had answered.</p><p>...Yes, she did. 
This was too much. Ignoring for once the stateliness imposed by the grandeur of the 
Enclosure, she had run back to Suguru's tent --</p><p>And Yoshino was gone. And so were the 
serving-boys. She thought to ask Suguru where his boys had gone, hoping to get the little 
dastards into trouble at least, but, oddly, Suguru had also disappeared. It wasn't like him 
to leave his guests to their own devices that way.</p><p><i>How long was I gone?</i> she'd 
thought to herself, her self-control slipping away as she looked frantically this way and 
that. <i>One turn around the courtyard at most. Impossible.</i></p><p>She'd dashed out into 
the sunlight once more, only to find a huge cloud going over the sun, a cloud piled high 
with white fluff, and with threatening dark bits on its underbelly. There were shadows 
everywhere, suddenly, and her Yoshino might have been stolen away into any one of them 
--</p><p>In and out between buildings and temples and concubines' palaces, "Yoshino? 
Yoshino!" And nothing, and nothing, and nothing. She kept approaching people to ask them 
questions and they kept running away. Why? What in the world was the matter with them 
all?</p><p>Even in the haze in which she was wandering, she managed to detain the next party 
passing by. A concubine, this woman was. Easy to see. All the courtly points of 
self-decoration, most prominently the long, long free-flying hair obscuring the features, 
the powdered face, the plucked eyebrows, the blackened, scarcely visible teeth. Truly 
splendid robes, much too rich for a servant.</p><p>"Don't run!" Rei shouted. "Don't you dare 
run! I have questions for you!"</p><p>The woman's attendants scattered, and she fell to her 
knees, trembling. "Spare me! I beg of you!"</p><p>Fortunately, Shimako-chan turned up at 
this point. "Rei-sama?" And there she was at Rei's side.</p><p>"Shimako-chan!" Rei said. 
"It's good to see you. I'm, er..."</p><p>"Looking for Yoshino-san."</p><p>"However did you 
know that?"</p><p>"Best not gone into now, I think, Rei-sama. Hadn't you better put away 
your sword? I think you're frightening this lady."</p><p>Rei looked down. She was, in fact, 
holding her sword, positioned for a horizontal, left-to-right slash. She had no recollection 
of having drawn it.</p><p>She sheathed it. This was rather embarrassing.</p><p>Shimako-chan 
knelt so as to be on the same level with the lady. "Please don't judge my friend too 
harshly," she said. "She has lost track of a girl who is her very dearest friend, indeed, 
her cousin. Can you help us to find her?"</p><p>The lady had stopped trembling. "Two braids? 
Beautiful, mysterious eyes? Was she with a couple of boys?"</p><p>"Yes, 
exactly."</p><p>"They went in there," she said, pointing at a nearby shed. "It's a 
storehouse, I think. I've never been in there."</p><p>"Thanks very much for your time, my 
lady," Shimako-chan said, in her most cultured tones, and turned to Rei. "Shall 
we?"</p><p>Rei struggled with herself as they crunched over white gravel. Shimako-chan had 
been so helpful. How to tell her?... "I should do this alone, Shimako-chan."</p><p>"If you 
want me to hide my eyes at an appropriate moment, I will, Rei-sama," Shimako-chan said. "But 
I think I should come with you."</p><p>Shimako-chan spoke Lady more fluently than anyone 
else in the Gang, with the obvious exception of Sachiko. As far as Rei could tell, what 
she'd just said translated as, "I have my own reasons for coming along, and any request that 
I go away will be carefully ignored."</p><p>Oh, well. At least it was Shimako-chan; 
Shimako-chan was discreet, and did not come unstuck in a crisis. Maybe it was for the best 
-- <i>now, up on the porch, slide the door open, and --</i></p><p>Two naked young men jumped 
away from each other, yelping and squealing, and dived behind an old kicho, or screen of 
state.</p><p>The room contained furniture and boxes, in some disorder. It might not have 
been cleaned in years.</p><p>Rei looked at Shimako-chan. Shimako-chan had turned away and 
was facing the courtyard, her face flaming.</p><p><i>She's probably never seen anyone naked 
before. Well, I told her I should do this alone.</i></p><p>"You," Rei said, addressing the 
kicho. "Boys. Young men. Servants of the accursed Suguru. You know who you bloody 
are."</p><p>There were sniveling noises.</p><p>"Your sniveling lacks conviction," Rei said 
coldly. "I can come back there and coach you, if you keep it up. With my 
sword."</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>"Now. Where is Yoshino?"</p><p>"Who's Yoshino?" said one 
puzzled voice.</p><p>Rei drew her sword. There's a way you can do it so it's quiet, and a 
way you can do it so it makes an impressive noise, and in view of the circumstances, Rei 
chose the noisy one. "Here I come, then!" she added.</p><p>The kicho trembled.</p><p>"The 
girl you left Prince Suguru's tent with," Shimako-chan said unexpectedly. "She wore her hair 
in braids."</p><p>"Oh, her!" said one voice. "She was here for a little while."</p><p>"She 
left just a few minutes ago," added the other. "Pity. She was terrific company."</p><p>"I 
think we bored her."</p><p>"Oh, don't be silly. She seemed pleased enough."</p><p>"Well, she 
was an awful lot of work. I was just as glad to see the back of her, myself."</p><p>"Oh, 
you're just as glad to see the back of <i>anybody</i> --"</p><p>Rei, with tears in her eyes 
and her sword raised, was about to charge forward. But she was stopped by Shimako's hand on 
her arm. "You lads shouldn't say anything else," she said, raising her voice only 
slightly.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>"If --" the first voice began, 
tentatively.</p><p>"Believe me," Shimako said firmly. "You should hold your tongues, and not 
discuss the matter. At all. With anyone. That is your safest move."</p><p>The room was 
quiet.</p><p>"Come along, Rei-sama." Shimako tugged at Rei's sleeve.</p><p>"They..." Rei 
croaked, and stopped.</p><p>"They nothing. That's all. Let's just leave. It's the most 
dignified course."</p><p>The door slid shut behind them.</p><p>The silence continued in the 
little storehouse, for a few moments. Then the first of the two voices said, "I forgot to 
mention that the girl is the most awful tease."</p><p>"Maybe it's just as well," said the 
second voice. "They seemed angry enough as it was."</p><p>"Shall we pick up where we left 
off?"</p><p>"...Yes, but not here. People apparently feel quite free to just dash in here 
without so much as knocking."</p><p>"Too true. We live in a fallen age, Keita. Standards are 
not what they used to be. Where are my socks?"</p><p>--</p><p>Yumi was trying to be brave. 
Perhaps it wasn't <i>very</i> dangerous, being here with Sachiko-sama's cousin, but she 
still didn't like or trust him, and none of her new friends were about, so it was 
<i>something</i>. And maybe it was the best she could do right now.</p><p>Curious, though. 
He called this a garden, but it was very different from Mizuno-sama's garden. Where hers had 
been awash with flowers and flowering trees, surprised into blossoming wakefulness by the 
first spring weather, this was mostly rocks, carefully arranged. Rocks, and some sparse long 
grasses, with an arranged air rather than a naturally grown one. And a fountain, ornamental, 
though of stark lines. Was this a more typical garden? Was this what Sachiko-sama had meant 
when she'd said there was no other garden like Mizuno-sama's in this country?</p><p>"What is 
this place?" Yumi asked, looking the tall prince directly in the eye for the first 
time.</p><p>"Beyond that stand of cedars, and past the wall of the Enclosure, is the old 
Ogasawara palace. See the high gables there, over the treetops?" He was smiling, and had a 
hand on her shoulder. She wondered what was really behind this carefully fashioned facade of 
calmness, gentlemanliness, unflappable nobility. Satou-sama had twitched the curtain, enough 
to reveal a very different kind of person.</p><p><i>Sachiko-sama wears a similar curtain 
over her true self.</i> Yes. But Sachiko-sama did let some people inside, people she was 
close to. She had honored Yumi this way, and Yumi could wish herself to have the same kind 
of curtain, so that she could invite Sachiko-sama inside, return the favor. <i>But 
everything about me is on the surface,</i> Yumi thought bitterly. <i>I'm transparent, just 
an ordinary beggar girl, a girl with no home, no past, no secrets. What does Sachiko-sama 
see in me? Why would she choose me?...</i></p><p>"Er... the <i>Ogasawara</i> palace?" Yumi 
asked, catching up at last.</p><p>"Yes," said Prince Suguru, chuckling gently. "Your 
Mistress's family home. We spent a lot of time in this garden when we were children, she and 
I."</p><p>The carefully arranged rocks and brush around her took on a new meaning. This was 
it, then. This was where Sachiko-sama had learned all that careful control, all that poise, 
in this severe aridity, like a poem all of one-syllable words. She seemed to see a little 
girl with long black hair and blue eyes sitting by the ornamental fountain, smarting from 
the latest lesson in good manners, maybe dreaming of dragon-fire in the sky over 
Koryo...</p><p>"Her family --"</p><p>"Her mother no longer attends festivals," said Prince 
Suguru a little sadly. "Oba-san goes visiting shrines instead; she's on a pilgrimage to 
Yogawa even now. She's about halfway to being a nun. A bit disappointed in life, is our 
oba-san." The Prince sighed a little. He sounded really sorry for her. Then he cleared his 
throat and said, in a stronger voice, "And Sacchan's Daddy is in China. Just took ship three 
days ago. He's in partnership with my own father, and with Fujiwara no Ryuusuke; the three 
of them handle much of our overseas business."</p><p>"So no one is living in the 
palace."</p><p>"Correct. I thought you'd like a glimpse of your family home." He laughed 
lightly.</p><p>Yumi looked at him unhappily. She could resent his behavior, but had not the 
power of correcting it.</p><p>"Also, of course, it's a good place for a private talk." He 
lifted his hand from her shoulder and retreated toward the cedars, backing up, still looking 
her in the eye. "There's someone here who wants to speak to you."</p><p>Yumi opened her 
mouth, to ask "Who?" and another hand landed on her shoulder, to replace Prince Suguru's, 
before she could get the word out.</p><p>She turned her head to see a face she'd hoped never 
to see again.</p><p>"Hello, my luck," said Tsujimoto no Fujito. "You can't know how I've 
missed you."</p><p>She jumped away from him. She took a quick look in Prince Suguru's 
direction, but he had vanished.</p><p>She looked back at Tsuji-sama and --</p><p>Grey 
mist.</p><p>--</p><p><i>Tsujimoto no Fujito had no magic of his own, so he'd had to buy 
some.</i></p><p><i>He'd lodged certain cherished movables with Old Keiko in the first place, 
so it was a simple matter, provided she had the necessary: just go to her and see if there 
was anything of his that appealed to her, and which she might be willing to accept in trade. 
And he had many lovely things he was sure would appeal to her, though, as she was blind, he 
had to describe them to her. His old perfume case, with mother-of-pearl inlay. An old koto 
which had belonged to his late mother. A --</i></p><p><i>"The golden box," she'd 
said.</i></p><p><i>He'd been afraid she'd say that. She'd probably had someone look the 
items over and tell her what was there -- unless she could just tell gold by the heft and 
the feel of it. "I don't know if I want --"</i></p><p><i>"A SPELL?" Old Keiko shrieked, 
baring her gums in what Tsujimoto hoped was a smile.</i></p><p><i>"I do, it's only that I 
don't know if I want the spell that badly --"</i></p><p><i>"You WANT A SPELL 
--"</i></p><p><i>"Yeeees," Tsujimoto said. He resented being shrieked at, and he was hanging 
onto his patience by his teeth here as it was.</i></p><p><i>"-- TO SET ALL TO 
RIGHTS!"</i></p><p><i>"Well..."</i></p><p><i>"A SPELL TO PUT YOU BACK WHERE YOU BELONG. THE 
WORLD THAT'S HOME TO YOU."</i></p><p><i>"Well... Yes."</i></p><p><i>"And you don't know if 
you want that as badly as you want a gold box?"</i></p><p><i>Tsujimoto tried 
silence.</i></p><p><i>"This gold box in partic'lar. Which smells like you kept incense in 
it."</i></p><p><i>"Yes. That's true --"</i></p><p><i>"What you really don't know," the witch 
went on with disconcerting helpfulness, "is if you really want to give the gold box to Old 
Keiko. Old Keiko is an ugly, stupid, eyeless, toothless old woman, and gold boxes would be 
wasted on her. Isn't that right?"</i></p><p><i>Tsujimoto growled deep in his throat, but 
said nothing.</i></p><p><i>"ISN'T THAT RIGHT?"</i></p><p><i>"What I really don't know," 
Tsujimoto burst out, "which should be obvious to any child, is whether a spell you sell me 
for a gold box is going to work or not. And if it doesn't work, am I going to be able to 
take you to task for it, and demand my gold box back, or am I going to be roasted on a stick 
by that blasted Ogasawara sorceress?"</i></p><p><i>Old Keiko laughed in rather a 
high-pitched, demented way. She took a bit of old leather out of the front of her robe, put 
it in her mouth, and began gumming it. Tsujimoto turned his gaze to the ceiling, and kept it 
fixed there, as she spoke, barely audibly, through the leather. "You want proof, then. You 
think Old Keiko's a liar and you want.. oh, what's the word?"</i></p><p><i>" A 
'demonstration'?" Tsujimoto said, with heavy patience, still eyeing the 
rafters.</i></p><p><i>"Look at me a moment."</i></p><p><i>As if it pained him to do so, 
which it rather did, Tsujimoto brought his gaze down from the ceiling and rested it on Old 
Keiko's venerable, revolting face.</i></p><p><i>There was a sort of grey mist, and when 
Tsujimoto no Fujito came to himself again, he was outdoors, with the sun hurting his eyes, 
stark naked, and lying in a trough of horse-water. There were several persons of the low 
birth and intelligence and dress sense predictable for this part of town laughing at him on 
the porch of the house across the street.</i></p><p><i>He got out of the trough, with as 
much dignity as he could muster, and, streaming water, walked back into Old Keiko's 
house.</i></p><p><i>She was still sitting where he'd left her, by her chest. "Pretty good, 
eh?" she said, dangling a crystal on a narrow strip of leather.</i></p><p><i>"And that will 
work for me as well?" Tsujimoto said, keeping his voice even with considerable 
effort.</i></p><p><i>"That it will. You can test it on my boy, if you like. Here, 
boy!"</i></p><p>Well... suffice to say, the test had been satisfactory. And seeing how 
quickly the beggar-girl succumbed to the crystal, he knew for certain that he had not been 
cheated.</p><p>"It's time to end this foolishness," he said. "I am Tsujimoto no 
Fujito."</p><p>"You are Tsujimoto no Fujito," the girl answered him. Her eyes had gone from 
brown to a curious black.</p><p>I am your Master," he went on. "My commands you must obey, 
or it will be the end of you. In all things you will obey me!"</p><p>"I will obey you," the 
beggar-girl acknowledged in a whisper.</p><p>"I set you a task, and the task must be 
completed. You have seen where she keeps the golden object?"</p><p>The beggar-girl nodded. 
Her eyes were lidded.</p><p>"Good," he said. "Tonight, while your mistress sleeps, you will 
take the object from its place, and bring it to the great cherry tree in the Western Market. 
I will be waiting there for you."</p><p>"I... will..."</p><p>"You must not fail in this, or 
it will mean your death."</p><p>"I... will... not."</p><p>Tsuji-sama stared. 
"What?!"</p><p>"I will not." The girl was blinking her black eyes, and her hands limply 
slapped at her robes, as if she were trying to awaken herself from a nightmare. "I will not 
betray my Mistress."</p><p>And for a moment, there was only the wind in the 
cedars.</p><p>The last few days had been difficult ones for Tsuji-sama, and to be balked 
now, when the goal was in sight, was too much. "Filth, offal, guttersnipe, sub-human 
sand-crab girl, you will do as you are told! You <i>will!</i> I am your Master! I am 
--"</p><p>There was a sudden dark shape, a cracking sound, and a terrible stinging pain in 
his hand, and he shrieked.</p><p>The crystal was gone, and it was no longer his cornered 
mascot in front of him, but a -- woman, or man? -- with strangely yellow hair. She was 
brandishing a sword in his direction.</p><p>"I think that's enough jiggery-pokery for one 
afternoon, sir," she -- yes, she -- said in a sly, mocking voice. "We in the Guild take it 
in ill part when a suspicious stranger molests our little sisters in this fashion. And then 
we do something ill to <i>his </i>part."</p><p>"Satou-sama --" there was the beggar-girl 
peeping around the swordswoman's shoulder. Her eyes were clear. All to do again!</p><p>"It's 
all right, Yumi-chan," said Satou-sama calmly, not taking her eyes off Tsujimoto. "I won't 
let him touch one hair of your strangely adorable head. En garde, recreant!"</p><p>"What 
does 'en gardu' mean?" Tsuji-sama wanted to know. He clutched at his stinging hand a bit, 
and looked about for possible escape routes.</p><p>"It means 'Draw your sword and let's 
settle this like gentlemen.'"</p><p>"You are not a gentleman, and I haven't got a sword." 
Tsuji-sama was growing more confused by the minute. <i>Like gentlemen?... With</i> 
swords<i>?...</i></p><p>"True, I'm neither a man, nor gentle. But I do have a sword. So, 
since you refuse to give me satisfaction, I shall have to knock you down and give you a 
thumping with the flat."</p><p>"You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>Satou-sama stared a bit. "Why the 
devil wouldn't I?"</p><p>And she did it.</p><p>--</p><p>Yumi watched as Satou-sama feinted 
at Tsuji-sama's head with her blade, took his legs out from under him with a sweeping kick, 
and began to pummel him with the flat as promised. Tsuji-sama let out a series of 
heart-rending shrieks; he was plainly unused to this kind of treatment.</p><p>It was strange 
to see Satou-sama like this. Her clownishness and grinning good humour had vanished in an 
instant, along with her slow, limping shamble. Her hair whipped about, staying out of her 
eyes somehow, and her grey eyes flashed with anger, and her movements were so fast they were 
difficult to track...</p><p>...But then Yumi's mind was taken up with other 
concerns.</p><p>People were trying to use her against Sachiko-sama.</p><p>That was bad 
enough, but the possibility that she might actually be an effective weapon was 
horrifying.</p><p>One hand was over her mouth, and she felt tears running down her cheeks. 
She didn't want to leave Sachiko-sama. She didn't want to die. Life had become so sweet in 
the last couple of days. She wanted to live with Sachiko-sama, and with Rei-sama and 
Yoshino-san. And yes -- with Satou-sama too, as scary as Satou-sama was at the moment. She 
wanted to go on the Questioning, she wanted to see the divine Amaterako-sama, and hear the 
music in the gorge... at Sachiko-sama's side... for always...</p><p>But her head was still 
foggy from what Tsuji-sama had done to her, and she knew that she was anybody's to command. 
She had gone with Prince Suguru because he'd asked her. She had nearly succumbed to 
Tsuji-sama's magic... there were dark forces, demons everywhere, and she was a tool, a 
weapon, waiting for any fiend to pick her up and use her against the one person she loved 
and respected most in all the world.</p><p>She had to go away. Now, while no one was 
looking. It went against the grain, to leave without a word, without seeing Sachiko-sama one 
more time... but if she stayed for one more sight of her, would she be able to 
leave?</p><p>She backed away from the preoccupied Satou-sama and the squealing Tsuji-sama. 
She turned south, and at the turn it was as if something was tearing inside her. She shed 
her robes, kicked away her shoes. Her bare feet remembered the stony earth, and in 
remembering, cast aside the present race, and dreamed another dream 
altogether...</p><p>--</p><p>"HOLD HARD!"</p><p>The voice was husky, and it shot up by an 
octave or two in the middle of "hard," but Sei stopped thumping the man anyway and looked 
up.</p><p>The Emperor was coming, along with two-thirds of the Guild high council and a 
couple of spare Dragons. Sachiko was leading the field, but it was the Emperor who had 
shouted.</p><p>Sei smiled a greeting at Sachiko, who just grimaced and said, "Sei, where's 
Yumi?"</p><p>Sei looked around, suddenly at a loss. She seemed to have got a bit carried 
away. Yumi was gone, and here she was thumping this man for no visible reason. Though it did 
feel good. "I'm sorry, Sachiko. She <i>was</i> here, but she seems to have done a runner 
while I was correcting this oaf."</p><p>"What was he doing?" Youko wanted to 
know.</p><p>"Phew, long story," Sei said. "He was using some kind of tu'penny-ha'penny magic 
to get Yumi in his power. A crystal, as I thought. I knocked it out of his hand." She looked 
around. Nowhere in sight. Probably wouldn't be easy to find. Oh, she was looking worse and 
worse...</p><p>Sachiko had started to dash off, but Fujiwara-dono had put a hand on her 
shoulder, and was telling her, "I know you want to find your young friend, but you should 
probably first get some idea of which way to go."</p><p>Sei was ready to start thumping 
herself. She'd lost Yumi after all. Sachiko had relied on her... <i>Why did Yumi 
run?</i></p><p>Sachiko took a deep breath. "Sei, why would this man want Yumi in his 
control?"</p><p>And then there were hurried footfalls, and Rei and Shimako had come rushing 
up, breathing hard. Well, Sei could score one point, perhaps, little as it would console 
Sachiko for the loss of Yumi. "Rei! Do you know this face?" She stooped, clutched the 
cringing worm's pigtails, and hoisted his head so his face was in view.</p><p>"In Heaven's 
name!" said the Emperor.</p><p>"Unnatural bitch!" whined the prisoner. "Unhand me, or I'll 
have you flayed!"</p><p>"You might want to reassess your position before you try that," Sei 
said with a happy smile.</p><p>"Why, that's one of the three villains we surprised the other 
night, outside our inn," Rei said wonderingly. "The chickenhearted one who wouldn't 
fight."</p><p>"One of the miscreants who sent Yumi up to your room the other night," Sei 
agreed, turning to Sachiko. "Given that he was just now trying to get Yumi under his 
control, and given his imperious manner, I suspect he's the ringleader of the operation." 
Sei looked now at the Emperor. "Do you perchance know this man, your Imperial 
Majesty?"</p><p>"<i>I</i> certainly do," Suga-sama interposed. "That is Tsujimoto no Fujito. 
He was banished from court a year ago. Appropriation of the wrong monies, and sleeping with 
the wrong daughters, as I recall."</p><p>"Oh?" It was like Suga-sama to butt in at this 
point, Sei reflected. "How interesting. So, <i>your Imperial Majesty</i>, he shouldn't be 
here?"</p><p>"He should be in Kyushu," the Emperor agreed. "He shouldn't be in Heian Kyo, 
and he certainly shouldn't be inside the Nine-Fold Enclosure. Tsujimoto-san, what do you 
here?"</p><p>Tsujimoto no Fujito did not speak. He just glared imperiously at the ground, 
which was an inch from his nose.</p><p>"Er," said the Emperor miserably. He rubbed his own 
nose with the back of his hand a bit.</p><p>Fujiwara-dono came forward. "Give me his head, 
Satou-san."</p><p>Sei relinquished the man's head to the wizened sorceress, who bent over 
the recreant with a terrible weight of power. Strange fires seemed to gleam in her 
eyes.</p><p>There was a suffocating atmosphere among all those there in the garden. The 
Emperor put his hands up to his face, ready to shield his vision from the ultimate 
horror.</p><p>Then Fujiwara-dono gave Tsujimoto's eyes a two-fingered poke, and slapped his 
face briskly a few times. Tsujimoto yelped and sniveled. "Your soul to perdition, you 
insolent little shit," Fujiwara-dono excoriated him calmly. "When the Emperor asks you a 
question, you answer him, and hop to it, or I'll get a firm grip on your tongue and YANK it 
heartlessly. Do you hear me?"</p><p>"Enough," he whined.</p><p>Fujiwara-dono dropped his 
head negligently so that his nose bumped in the dust, and she stood over him. "Or maybe I'll 
just give you to Satou-san to play with some more. It looked like she was enjoying herself. 
Would you like that?"</p><p>"What in the world is going on?"</p><p>Everyone looked up. 
Shimazu Yoshino had arrived. She wasn't the sort to be self-conscious, easily embarrassed, 
but she did seem to wilt a little under the annoyed gaze of the Guild leadership, the 
confused one of the Emperor, and the brief glance, the wounded and wounding look, the 
turning-away of Rei.</p><p>"Yumi has disappeared, Yoshino," Sachiko said. She was visibly 
struggling to be calm, gentle. "You didn't happen to see where she went, did 
you?"</p><p>"No. I've been, um, preoccupied," Yoshino answered, glaring at Rei. Then she 
swivelled full-face back to Sachiko. "What, Yumi-san's <i>disappeared</i>? That's awful! Are 
we looking for her?"</p><p>"Yes. I need to know if this person --" Sachiko waved an arm at 
the prone man flinching at the feet of Fujiwara-dono and Satou Sei -- "has any idea of where 
she went."</p><p>"I don't," said Tsujimoto no Fujito, with his newly acquired 
face-down-on-the-ground haughtiness, "and if I did know, I wouldn't tell 
<i>you</i>."</p><p>--</p><p>Sachiko went to him. She reached down. She got him by the hair. 
Looking him fully in the face for the first time, she saw something jumping in his eyes. She 
knew what he was going to do even before his hand disappeared under his robes.</p><p>She 
gave him the credit of not believing it was something he'd ordinarily do. People kept 
grabbing his hair, he'd been beaten and pummeled into a corner, and now he was lashing out, 
dangerously, perhaps because he'd seen something in her eyes that he thought meant his 
doom.</p><p>Someone, Sachiko never found out who, cried "Knife! Knife --" And, before the 
second "knife" had been said, there the knife was, buried halfway to the hilt -- in 
Tsujimoto's left arm.</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>Before he could make up his scattered mind 
what to do about the knife in his arm, the hilt still in his hand, Sachiko's right hand had 
closed over it. Her left hand still gripped his hair.</p><p>He gazed at her in 
terror.</p><p>"Stabbed yourself," she said, calmly. "Clumsy of you. But we sorceresses 
sometimes make people nervous, and they do things like that. I'm sure we don't intend to. 
And now... An unexpected treat! I am in complete control of this arm. What do you suggest I 
do with it?"</p><p>"Please let go," he whispered. "Please let go, please let go, please 
--"</p><p>"What were you doing with Yumi?"</p><p>"Nothing! Nothing! I was only 
--"</p><p>"Only using some magic on her involving a crystal. Only trying to assert control 
over her, for some dark end, it doesn't matter to me so much what you were trying to do -- I 
think I have a suspicion what it was. What matters to me is that you were using Yumi to do 
it. Correct?"</p><p>"I didn't mean her any -- AAAAGH --"</p><p>"It seems to hurt you 
particularly badly when I turn it just so rightwards; it scrapes against something. I shall 
try to avoid doing that in future, though I can promise nothing. <i>Look at me</i>." She 
struck at him with her voice and her eyes, and his shining eyes were locked on her dark ones 
willy nilly. "I have news for you, Tsujimoto-san. Yumi is my imouto now. That means she is 
off-limits to you. You do not spin your filthy crystals at her. You do not come near her, 
speak to her, ever again. If you do I will destroy you so completely there won't even be a 
memory --"</p><p>"-- stop -- please --" The worm was crying. His nose was running. The 
filthy cowardly little --</p><p>Sachiko felt a hand on her shoulder. Tightening her grip on 
Tsujimoto's knife hand -- he keened -- she turned her head to look. It was 
Sei.</p><p>"That's enough, Sachiko," Sei said calmly.</p><p>"Why do you interfere?" Sachiko 
hissed.</p><p>"I've given him a thrashing, and you've scared the crap out of him. It's 
enough."</p><p>"Enough? Yumi is gone! You lost Yumi, Satou-san. This man --"</p><p>"If you 
keep going the way you're going, you'll kill him. He's a prisoner and a wounded man. Do you 
want that on your conscience?"</p><p>Sachiko started. Her grip on the knife hand lessened. 
"I wasn't..." She couldn't finish the sentence. She looked around. Most everybody seemed to 
be very interested in the ground, or the trees. <i>A knife in his arm won't</i> kill <i>him, 
however I twist it.</i> Only Youko and Fujiwara-dono were looking at her, and their faces 
were unreadable.</p><p><i>I wasn't going to kill him. Was I?...</i></p><p>"Sacchan, please 
don't hurt him," came a new voice.</p><p>Sachiko looked up, along with everyone 
else.</p><p>Prince Suguru had joined them. He stood by the fountain. He looked more moved 
than she'd ever seen him. His eyes kept shifting to the prostrate man who was her 
prey.</p><p>"I saw where she went, Sacchan," he went on. "South. Back into the City, I 
suppose." He pointed over the hillock.</p><p>"Where were you hidden to see that, your 
highness?" Fujiwara-dono wondered.</p><p>"In the cedars there," he said calmly, with a small 
gesture.</p><p>Sachiko stood. She stared at him, her inaccessible yet ubiquitous cousin. The 
calm accusation in her look was answered by acquiescence, even a little shame in 
his.</p><p>"This villain is an old friend of yours, isn't he?" she said levelly, prodding 
Tsujimoto gently with her shoe. "I used to hear a lot about the two of you, before he was 
banished."</p><p>"Sacchan, please let me explain --"</p><p>"You are dead to me." Cold. 
Brusque. Final.</p><p>In the stunned silence that followed, Sachiko turned on her heel and 
began to head south. She hoped she was brushing off the dust of the old family garden for 
good. She had always hated this garden.</p>
