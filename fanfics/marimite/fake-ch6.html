<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As the  fire died to ashes, a man came asking for directions / wanted to know  the way to the Promised Land.</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No one  knew the way.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Break of  Dawn</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi and  Sachiko met up with the rest of them just outside of the hospital;  Sei was leaning against a wall, dirtying her coat more than Sachiko  would have thought appropriate.  The rain had stopped, the sun had  come out, at least for the moment, and the humidity was very nearly  staggering—why they were outside, then, was beyond Sachiko, but she  allowed herself to dismiss it.  She was quite certain, if Sei was  involved, that there was probably no reason for it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko!”  Yoshino cried as they caught sight of them.  She began to move  towards them, but was caught about the shoulder by Rei, who smiled at  her gently.  Yoshino looked back at the taller girl, and for a  second, Sachiko was quite certain that they’d had an argument,  right there, in that near-immeasurable timespan.  The next second,  Yoshino relaxed and smiled at the two of them, alongside Rei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  funny, Sachiko thought, noticing this for the first time—though the  two of them were barely alike at all, their smiles were nearly  identical, from the way their lips creased gently at the tip, to the  barest hint of white showing in the center of the grin, to the way  their eyes followed only slightly, a rare display of pure affection.  Sachiko wondered if the two smiled like this in private, at each  other, and if it was perhaps a bit like looking into a mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Miss  Ogasawara,” came a voice from behind Sachiko.  Perhaps a harsher  voice might have startled her, but this voice, soft and flowing, a  bit like a peaceful river, probably couldn’t have done it in the  most nerve-wrackingly frightening situations, let alone on a humid  day outside of a hospital. “You’re all right. I’m very  relieved.” It was quite apparent that she was, as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  turned her whole body to face the newcomer—Shimako—and bowed  slightly to her. Out of all of them, this was the girl that Sachiko  knew the least, and was therefore inclined to be the most exceedingly  polite to.  “Please excuse the trouble I’ve caused you,”  Sachiko said; it was about as humble as she ever was, really.  Humbleness was the only part of being a lady which did not, even now,  come naturally to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  you have to apologize, you have failed in some respect.  You should  never have to apologize, but if you must make a mistake, make a quiet  one, </em>her teachers had said.  Manners coaches. Old, spent women  whose only remaining joy in life was shaping Sachiko’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Horrid  people. </em>It was the first time in many years that Sachiko had  felt comfortable even thinking that. As awful as it was to say about  a person, Sachiko knew it was true.  It was, in fact, one of the few  things that she and Suguru didn’t silently clash about—the two of  them had shared a manner’s coach as children.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako  only smiled, perhaps as though she hadn’t heard Sachiko at all.  Perhaps her smile was a sign that she had. For Shimako, words were  not precisely a common thing to begin with. She wasn’t quiet,  precisely; simply not given to unnecessary conversation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  Sachiko had looked around then, she might have seen Sei, standing  straight now, peering at Shimako with a strange mix of affection and  curiosity. Were Sachiko privy to Yumi’s thoughts at the moment, she  might have known that Shimako’s voice had contained a genuine note  of relief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  if she’d been aware of both of these, she might have put the pieces  together.  It wasn’t important, not really, not to anybody but Yumi  and Sei; but what was important to Yumi was important to Sachiko.  She had decided that a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence  for a moment. Something Sachiko was still not entirely comfortable  with.  She wanted to say something, but wasn’t quite sure what to  say. Her stomach still hurt a little—the doctor they’d spoken to  had told her that this was likely to be the case for quite a  while—and really, she just wanted to get home.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No.  That’s a lie.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t want to go back home. Not back <em>there. </em>Normally, she  could at least relax there when nobody was around—shut herself in  the study and read, or (heaven forbid she fill her head with that  drivel) watch television on occasion.  Their family had a massive  television—it had been mistaken for one of the room’s walls, on  occasion—but it seemed that only the men were allowed to use it. It  was an unspoken rule, and one whose violations would go unpunished,  but it was there nonetheless. Set in place not by the men, but by the  coaches. <em>If you have nothing better to do than fill your head  with that mindless drivel, teach yourself a useful skill. Knit. Cook.  You’ve been gifted with an enormous house; use it. </em>Really,  Sachiko thought, it was very backwards.  Very misogynistic, which was  odd since it had all come from women.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t want to go back there, where all she could do was read, or  teach herself a <em>useful household skill. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can  teach you a <em>really </em>useful household skill, one that’ll  actually get you somewhere, <em>the old man said, brushing up against  her shoulder.  He had been a coach’s husband, a spent old man whose  only remaining joy in life was ruining others’. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  shook her head.  There was no use thinking about<br />
      <em>not  thinking about that</em><br />
  that  now, was there?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled slightly.  “Well,” she said as best she could, “there’s  no purpose left in standing around here, is there? I suppose we  should call someone to come pick us up.” <em>Stupid girl, what are  you doing?  You don’t want to go home. </em>Part of her—most of  her, really—said it with every hope that somebody would contradict  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  funny thing about hope was that it rarely ran parallel with one’s  expectations. Perhaps that was why she was so surprised when Sei  said, “No reason for that, Sachiko.  I’ve got a car right here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  eyes widened, and for a moment, Sachiko thought wildly that her eyes  might very well pop out of their sockets.  The next second, Yumi was  shaking her head violently.  “No!” she said, as seriously as she  could. “Sa…<em>Onee-sama </em>has a very bad stomach right now,  Sei, and the last thing she needs is you driving her around!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  nearly threw her head back as she laughed. Sachiko had to hold  herself in from doing the same, though the rest of them looked more  or less nonplussed.  In fairness, Sachiko had no idea what Yumi was  on about either—it was more the feeling of the thing.  Yumi had no  trouble being serious, but her expressive, endearing face—which  shifted more rapidly than Sachiko could sometimes keep up with—made  it difficult to take her seriously when she was trying so hard to  fight against something. Sachiko felt a little bad thinking this, in  all honesty. “Yumi,” Sei said, very obviously fighting to keep  tears of mirth in her eyes.  “How you wound me! I’m a fine  driver!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Yumi repeated, shaking her head. “You’re frightening, at <em>best!</em>”  Though in truth, Sachiko knew, Suguru was by and far a scarier driver  than Sei could ever possibly be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  cruel,” Sei mock-sighed, “clinging so hard to your harsh judgment  of me, derived from my very first inaugural drive. How harsh do the  small-minded make my existence!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,”  Yoshino said, grinning, “I was in the car driving here too! I don’t  think I’d want you driving me either! You’re <em>scary, Rosa  Gigantea! </em>So reckless!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yoshino,”  Rei murmured. “Please do not offend <em>Rosa Gigantea.</em>” She  paused, and then with a wry grin, added, “though I have to admit,  the thought of taking another run in your car is unpleasant, at  best.”<br />
      <em>What…<br />
        What  is this feeling?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi,  I didn’t hear you complaining when we were on our way here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  may have been because you weren’t listening to us, Miss Satou.”<br />
      <em>Is it  jealousy?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  stood, watching the four of them playfully battle it out.  Simply  stood.  They had not formed some new convex formation, deliberately  blocking all others out with their bulbous, strangely exclusive  shape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is it  loneliness? Sadness at being excluded? They’re talking about you,  without you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  can’t be intentional. They’re your friends. Break in.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  say what? Something harsh and chastising? Something prim and proper?  What would I say at a time like this? They can banter so…naturally.  I don’t think I ever learned the art. I can’t just break in and  stop them from having fun.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was focusing on the road!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think you should focus on the weight of your foot, is what I think,”  Yoshino said. “Stop using your lead heels.”<em><br />
  They  all like Sei. No, that’s not right. They all find her…</em><br />
  fun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody was gently tugging on her sleeve.  She looked, and  it was Shimako.  The girl wasn’t smiling, but there was a strange  sort of grin which seemed to stem from her entire face. Her eyes,  which were not focused on Sachiko but on something in front of them,  held the silent command, <em>look there, quick before you miss it. </em>Sachiko had ever been good at reading silent hints—she had come  to learn that most of the most important hints <em>were </em>silent—and  so followed the trail of the short, pretty girl’s line of sight.  Straight ahead, and then at</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yumi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi,  no longer focused on the half-jolly banter which had come to  encapsulate Sei, Yoshino, and Rei.  Yumi, no longer attempting to  hide her embarrassment—the subtle, amused sort of embarrassment  that comes from well-employed, gentle teasing—but gazing at  Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, that  wasn’t right. <em>Staring </em>at Sachiko.  Staring with worry  etched in each and every line of her face, one hand unconsciously  balled into a fist, clutched with the other hand into her breast.  When Sachiko’s eyes met hers, she jumped with the surprise that was  expected of somebody caught staring, but did not whip her head away,  desperate not to be caught for an extended length of time.  For a  second, they simply locked eyes, and then Sachiko did something she  didn’t expect, and smiled at Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The<br />
      <em>What  was it? Jealousy? Longing? That funny pull at her chest, that little  vacuum at the back of her head.</em><br />
  feelingvanished immediately. That awful feeling of being on the outside,  while the girl<br />
  <em>woman</em><br />
  she<br />
  <em>liked</em><br />
  was  close to was on the inside, being close to somebody else.  By all  means, Sachiko thought, a childish feeling, but who could really help  it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Who  indeed? </em>The new voice inside her head said, bearing its own  half-motherly grin. <em>Time was, you’d have chastised yourself for  days over that. You’ve come far, and  fast, Sachiko. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was quite possibly the first time in her life that Sachiko could  remember that little inner monologue of hers saying something like  that.  Saying <em>good job, </em>instead of <em>next time, do better.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled.  Smiled at herself, and smiled at Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“—bladder!”  Yoshino said, positively upset now, or at least feigning it.  She wasn’t hard to get a rise out of, in any case—she was  probably the only person taking Sei’s antics seriously. “You  think I want to ruin my pants like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think I’d let you in my car if I thought you’d do  something like that,” Sei grinned. “Maybe I just have to make  sure that doesn’t happen.” Her grin was very nearly predatory,  and Rei put a hand on Yoshino’s shoulder, her face mock-protective.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“None  of that, please, <em>Rosa Gigantea.</em>” She said it with the  patience of a longtime nanny chastising her charge—mildly amused,  but virtually endless, so long as her paycheck still came every week.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei,  indefatigable, said, “Maybe I ought to make <em>doubly </em>sure,  then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Time  was also, you’d have made yourself not care about being on the  outside. About not really being a part of what’s going on around  you, because you were too concerned with being </em>Sachiko Ogasawara, <em>upright heir to a powerful company that’s been promised to her  husband, if she’ll have him. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  the three playfully argued, Yumi moved. Slowly, so as not to be  noticed—though, really, nobody would have spoken on it if she had  been, and wasn’t Shimako watching anyway?  She edged closer, first  simply feigning a sort of idle, restless-leg pace, and then shifting  to a gentle shuffle. Before Sachiko could really process it, Yumi was  standing next to her, a small grin on her face, facing the rest of  the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  Sachiko had asked Shimako about it, Shimako might have said, were she  feeling talkative, that she believed that Yumi was blushing a  little—indeed, she might have said, it seemed that there was a bit  of color present in Yumi’s cheeks, color which had nothing to do  with the humidity. Sachiko did not ask Shimako about it, however, and  so the thing went unsaid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If Yumi  had asked Sei about it, (and presented her with an appropriate  offering) Sei might have admitted that she believed that Sachiko, who  she was watching quite intently out of the corner of her eye, had a  small grin on her face. A smile which had nothing to do with Sei’s  attempts to keep Rei and Yoshino occupied for as long as possible, so  that Yumi and Sachiko could decide for themselves what to do, and so  that Shimako could, just maybe, mix with them a little. Yumi did not  ask Sei about it, however, and so this thing went unsaid as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe it  was just as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you think, <em>Onee-sama?</em>” Yumi said quietly. “Would you  like to go back?”<br />
      <em>and  do what</em><br />
  “What  would you like, Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s  small grin widened, and it occurred to Sachiko that perhaps Yumi  wasn’t so deep in thought anymore.  That maybe she’d made up her  mind. Sachiko wasn’t quite sure what to make of that yet, so she  put it aside for now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think I’d like to go for a drive,” she said. “I don’t think  Sei should drive, since I don’t know if your stomach could handle  anything like that—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t believe anybody’s stomach here is entirely up to making  such a drive twice,” Shimako interjected with a sweet smile, and  Yumi clamped a hand over her mouth to keep herself from chortling at  this—Shimako did not have a harsh tongue, not by any means, but she  did have a sharp sort of wit about her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi,”  Sei said with a grin, loud enough to make it clear who her intended  audience was.  “Too far, now.  Besides, don’t think you’re  going anywhere in <em>my </em>car without <em>me.</em>” Rei and Yoshino  seemed far less surprised than they ought to have been at suddenly  being interrupted like this, which led her to believe that perhaps  her intended distraction was nowhere near as useful as she thought it  might have been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  said, “I think that’s all right. I have a car at home that could  fit all of us, anyway, and that way, none of us would have to put up  with Sei driving again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  drive.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Strangely  enough, that sounded wonderful to Sachiko. Sachiko, who had spent her  entire life in spacious limousines. Sachiko, who was used to slow,  courteous drivers, and who positively refused to ride with the one  man who violated that trend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  than that, she wanted to do it with Sei. Sachiko had a strange idea  in her head: She had an idea that if they waited for Sei to drive Rei  back to her house, for Rei to drive Sei back to her house to deposit  her car, for all of them to return back to the hospital to pick up  the rest of the group, and then for them to follow the calm,  unenthusiastic mood with a calm, unenthusiastic discussion of where  to joyride to, it would no longer be a joyride.  It would be a drab,  polite way to spend an afternoon and an evening.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  didn’t want it that way. Yumi wanted Sachiko to be comfortable.  She knew—rightly so—that in the rare cases in which Sachiko was  uncomfortable, things did not become pleasant. Sachiko was not  somebody who lost her composure often, and so she was not experienced  in dealing with it.  Sei was prone to lose people their composure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  also wanted to do something that Sachiko had never really considered.  She wanted to go out, and have fun for its own sake.  Why? Because  why not, that was why.  Something so coordinated could never be  enjoyable like that, because in coordinating it, they would remove  every last ounce of adventure.  Suck it dry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had this odd idea, and, for possibly the first time in her  life—perhaps it was the odd weather, or perhaps it was this  peculiar lightheaded feeling she got as Yumi quietly intertwined  their hands again—she acted on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she said quietly.  “I think we can all squish into Sei’s car long  enough to make it to something more comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  gaped in open-mouthed wonder, as did Yumi.  Shimako grinned a little  at Sei, who winked back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  held her breath, waiting for the verdict.  This was, after all, still  a democracy of sorts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think that’s an excellent idea,” Yoshino said. “Positively  marvelous, although I have to admit, also positively idiotic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  second, Sachiko feared—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  thought that Yoshino was—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  then, all of them would—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then  again, Sachiko didn’t know Yoshino very well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  Yoshino continued, “I suppose your silence means that I’ve staked  my claim on the passenger’s seat without challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  cracked first, smiling and nodding, and then laughing.  The rest of them followed  shortly. Even Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  easily was the course of Sachiko’s life and happiness decided, that  she would later wonder if she did, indeed, have any control over it  at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  it mattered.</span></p>
