<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sa shi  su se so.” is a part of the Japanese alphabet, which is divided  into 46 basic sounds. (plus double-letter sounds which technically  bring it to easily twice that).  The order is used frequently in  memorizational mnemonics, much as the ABC song might be used in  English.</span></p>

Of what  Kunikuda would later tell his friends pertaining to his date with <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">that really hot catholic girl</span></em>, about half would be true. Among  the falsities he would tell would be that the girl “just sort of  froze up” as soon as he touched her—this was not entirely a lie,  but it was certainly not the truth. Sei did indeed stiffen at his  touch, but as they entered the restaurant and the warmth of the  lights and heater washed over the two of them, he let go almost  immediately, and she relaxed.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  restaurant was fairly lavish, considering it boasted itself as a “bar  and grill.” White linen flanked Asawakina’s walls, hanging down  in small half-circles, which seemed to melt into drapes around the  windows.  Immediately to their left, a large gap in the wall gave  them a glimpse of where Sei <em>really </em>wanted to be—the bar. The  halfway-enticing, halfway-repulsive aroma of fresh booze and stale  tobacco brushed over them as they passed this opening, on their way  to the section of the restaurant reserved for nonsmokers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently, Kunikuda had made reservations—Sei hadn’t realized  that this would be a disappointment until she felt it gnaw at her  stomach. He confirmed them with a man with a stiff suit and a stiffer  mustache, who merely nodded and guided them to a table. Sei thought  she probably could have found it by herself, but she didn’t turn  her nose at it, if only because it would have been ungodly rude.  They walked in single file—the maitre’d in front, followed at a  short distance by Kunikuda, followed in turn by Sei, who could  practically see over his head. It was a bit like the ants, marching  one by one, down into whatever a fancy American Bar and Grille had in  lieu of the ground. Kunikuda didn’t try to say anything to her, and  for that, Sei was glad; something inside of her was a little bit  frightened at the place. Nothing she could have put her finger  on—maybe something in the casual glances of the middle-aged women  and the not-so-casual glances from their middle-aged husbands, that  glance that said, <em>what the hell are you doing with </em>that <em>hobbit? Why don’t you come here and sit down, and I’ll tell  this old ball and chain that I work with you. It’ll be fun for  everyone.  Honest. But not fun </em>and <em>honest, no way, not us,  right? Right? Right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(RIGHT?  ISN’T THAT RIGHT? WE’LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN WON’T WE SEI JUST COME  AND SIT DOWN HERE)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  almost hurt. Sei put her index finger and thumb on the bridge  of her nose, massaging, trying to force the pain back down—something  which in and of itself was like trying to burn out the blaze  consuming your house. She wasn’t aware that she’d slowed her pace  until Kunikuda did a quick turn, found her falling behind, and said,  “Sei? Are you all right?” with a genuinely concerned look on his  face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  smiled at him—faked, and obviously so, a fact which was not lost on  him—and nodded. “Of course,” she said, and then hurried towards  the table that the maitre’d had come to stand next to, waiting for  them with all the patience of an apathetic babysitter. <em>Any time  you’re ready, I’m here. Just don’t make too much noise—my  stories are on. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  both sat, and the stiff-mustached man took their orders. Wine for  Kunikuda. Beer for Sei. Another man might have seen this as a test,  or even better, a sign that Sei was trying to relate. Kunikuda,  called an <em>old soul </em>by his mother and a <em>perceptive dumbass </em>by most of his friends, knew better. He thought briefly about  giving up then and there and going home—if he had ever dated a girl  who wanted him around <em>less </em>than this Satou Sei, he would  probably have been jailed for it. The two old excuses immediately  flew into his mind, the easy, oblivious salve to assuage his mildly  bruised ego, the two excuses known to all men who have been, either  inadvertently or otherwise, shot down, burned, or otherwise decimated  in an attempt at romance: <em>Maybe she’s on her period. Or maybe  she’s a lesbian.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  maybe you could stop being a fucking moron. She goes to a Catholic  school—Lillian, that really conservative one where they don’t let  you bring boys on campus. She’d be burned alive, if not by the  teachers than by the other girls. They’d have driven her out as  soon as they scented her if that was the case. </em>He didn’t find  out until later how close to the truth he had come, thinking that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking  himself suddenly brave, Kunikuda said, “So.”  So. An ancient  conversation starter from an ancient conversationalist. <em>What do  you think of the restaurant? What kind of beer do you like? I found  the best wine on the menu at a glance because I did my homework, but  I’m straight, honest.  In case you were nervous about that, and not  about me, like…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like  you are. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  was looking at him semi-anxiously; was she waiting for him to speak  or waiting for an opportunity to bolt? It was hard to tell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sa  shi su se so. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  a fascinating person you are, buddy.  Wanna have a cup of tea  sometime? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  he repeated. <em>Wanna hear about the people in my head mocking me  for not knowing what to say? Are you a lesbian, or am I less suave  than I thought? Shut up. </em>“What…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stared at his neck a little meekly, and he sighed. If there was  somebody on God’s good earth as unapproachable as this girl was,  she probably had a continent to herself. It wasn’t that she was <em>gruff—</em>she just looked…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Scared. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Scared.  That’s what she looked. Why the hell would a girl like her look  scared? She’d probably been on hundreds of dates.  She had to have  experience with guys—even fascist parents couldn’t keep a girl  like her from dating in school when they weren’t paying attention.  (If Sei had heard him say that, she might have said that she had a  very wealthy friend she’d like him to meet).  So what was this,  then? This was practically rape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunikuda  shook his head. <em>Fuck it. Date is blown already. We may as well be  frank about it. </em>“Look,” he said, not angry, but feeling very  tired all at once.  “If you want to go, you can go. I’ll pick up  the tab, since I was planning to anyway. I’ll even drink what you  ordered if you want to leave, since truth be told, I’ll drink beer  just as easily as wine, even if it tastes like horse piss going both  ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t…” Sei frowned at him, and he realized he could see the  gears in her head…standing still. Not frantically churning out an  excuse. Not trying to come up with a way to salvage what was left of  the date, little though it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Here,  Kunikuda would commit what he would later call to his friends his  second, enormous, huge, unforgivable gaffe of the evening; one that,  he would add in quiet, <em>you know </em>tones, prettymuch earned him  that night of cold, lonely masturbation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  did. You’re looking at me like you’re scared I’m going to rape  you. It’s like instead of a suave, well-dressed man eying you with  mild concern, you see sitting across from you a lazy-eyed,  two-hundred pound chain-gangster leering at you over a flask of paint  thinner.”  He liked that.  That was good. “So if you want to  leave, that’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t,” Sei said, pressing her hands into her lap in a fashion  which Kunikuda could not help but find unbearably cute. She even  turned away slightly, blushing.  She hated that—she wasn’t even  doing it on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Truth be  told, he was only half on the mark, she thought.  She certainly  didn’t see a suave, well-dressed man sitting across from her, but  she was confident in her ability to defend herself, or at least to  scream loud enough to wake half the neighborhood should the need  arise. But she wasn’t afraid, either.  Not really. <em>You’re not  afraid of some guy whose only sin is trying to wine you maybe a  little too fast and wearing socks that don’t live up to what his  pants and shoes promise. </em>(A little gaffe she’d noticed on the  way in).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  you are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she was. She wasn’t afraid of men, but truth be told, she was  piss-herself scared of this one, because he wasn’t acting like  she’d expected. He <em>wasn’t </em>leering at her over a flask of  paint thinner, fondling his (unbearably small) erection, burping loud  enough to shake the chairs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  truth is, you know absolutely shit about good men. That’s what your  problem is. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here.   Let me help you get your coat.”  Kunikuda did not let any of his  disappointment, nor his frustration, creep into his voice, instead  keeping it gentle and strong all at once, as he had learned to do  long ago.  (Women, he knew, loved men with good bodies, but would  still fall in love with a good radio personality any day of the  week).  Nonetheless, Sei knew it was there, because how could it not  be?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But at  the same time, this wasn’t what she wanted.  What she <em>needed. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she said, and then with a very brave hand, touched his arm as it  reached for her.  “Please, have a seat. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will  you tell me what it is that’s scaring you so badly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not—” She tried it a second time, and it was no more effective  than the first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are. Your hand is trembling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  ordered a cold beer. The restaurant is heated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stared at each other for a moment, and then Kunikuda sat down with a  grin on his face.  He found that, in spite of his frustration, he  actually liked Sei quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  found she was thinking the same about this man, but not in the way he  would have liked. She liked his directness, and she liked the way he  knew when to quit.  (His friends would have disagreed with  that—perhaps he simply got the <em>no trespassing </em>scent a little  earlier than usual this time around, they would say).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  waiter appeared then, and without looking at either of them, placed  their drinks in front of them.  “Will you be needing any more time  to decide on your food?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dunno,”  Kunikuda said.  “Will you, Sei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  looked at him for a long moment, trying to decide what he meant by  that.  Then, finally, “Yeah—yes.  Please come back in a few  minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  waiter bowed and vanished, and Kunikuda said, “You can be  remarkably gentle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should see the school I went to. If you went there for twelve years,  you’d be a gentle lady by the time you were through too.” She  said it without thinking about it, and then all at once, she burst  into a small fit of laughter, thinking a bit of Yumi—if they could  make a lady out of <em>her, </em>they could make a lady out of anybody.   Even Sei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunikuda  snorted indulgently.  “Where is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  the same school I go to now. Have you heard of the Lillian school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  in rumor and speculation.  It’s an all-girls catholic school is  what I heard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  heard right. What were the rumors?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  worth mentioning, especially not in polite company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  snorted back at him at this, equally indulgently.  “Go on. I’m  the last person you want to think of as polite compa—” she  stopped. <em>What the hell are you doing, woman? You’re getting  sucked into this conversation so fast…you’re starting to let your  guard down. What the hell did you just let yourself say? At this  rate, he’s gonna…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Gonna  know you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunikuda  was looking at her seriously. She tried to smile back at him, but  found it didn’t suit her that time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  me,” he said. “Tell me what’s going on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head. “It’s nothing important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  frequently stop speaking midword?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked away. <em>Why won’t he just stop asking questions and acting  all concerned? It’s annoying and difficult. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He’s  probably thinking the same thing about you. </em>The thought brought  her a deceptive warmth, one which, if depended on for heat, only led to frostbite.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  me. I feel as though I’m being jerked around here and I’ve only  known you for ten minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you <em>care?</em>” she snapped at him, louder than she’d  intended. She could hear the room go a little quieter at that—<em>can  you really hear something like that? Is the absence of noise a sound  unto itself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is  the absence of companionship company unto itself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  question nagged at her more than she would have liked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunikuda  took a moment to unfreeze himself, and then after another moment,  settled back into his seat. “Because,” he said, “heaven help  me, but I like you.” She froze now, and he shrugged as best he  could. “Take that as you want. I liked talking with you for the  twenty seconds we did it, and I think I enjoyed your company the  first time we met, even if you didn’t enjoy mine, which is frankly  why I was shocked when you called me back, and why I was a little  suspicious. Was I wrong to be suspicious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you mean?” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  mean, are you jerking me around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you mean?” she repeated, honestly unsure of what he was saying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  mean,” he said, then took a moment to think.  When he spoke again,  it was slower, his voice quieter and more controlled than it usually  was: “Are you using me for something you could have just asked me  for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t ask you for anything,” she said. “I don’t know you.” <em>If I did, would it matter?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you did,” he said, “would it help?” She nearly choked.  “You’re  tense and nervous and it’s making you irritable, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  right, and she knew it.  What was worse, she hadn’t covered it  up—as though his upfront, disarming mannerisms had taken all of the  Lady out of her, and destroyed all of the many defenses the Lady in  her provided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And, she  knew, that was exactly it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  been upfront and honest with her, even so far as to offer her the  door because he knew she wanted to take it.  He was on the level with  her, and he seemed comfortable with the fact that he wasn’t going  to be getting any off her, or if he wasn’t, he gave no sign of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  had even been a good sport when he figured out he was being used.  That was the worst thing of all, the most horrible thing.  He knew  it, and he’d caught on faster than she could have imagined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This…</em>she  sighed. <em>I suppose this is what a</em> good man <em>looks like.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Here  was where Kunikuda’s friends and Sei would be in complete  agreement. Maybe they thought he was usually too pushy, and maybe she  thought his taste in wine was a little bit odd, because he’d  ordered what she’d spotted as the shittiest drink on the menu, but  neither would have argued with the other over this one central  argument: Endo Kunikuda was a generally good man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Really,  wasn’t that the one thing she wasn’t really expecting, except in  her most bitter, hopeful thoughts?<br />
      <em>(to  admit that you’d have to acknowledge that such a thing exists)<br />
        (don’t  be a narrowminded bitch)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” she said. “You’re right and I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  smiled the smile of a man victorious in his defeat, disappointed and  contented all at once, and leaned back. “Do tell,” he said, and  in that instant, Sei moved even nearer to Endo Kunikuda’s friends,  a group which she would be joining within a couple of weeks, though  she didn’t know it: She thought he was being a bit pushy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nonetheless,  she thought that he was maybe entitled to a little bit of  explanation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">First,  though, the waiter, come like a southern wind, chilling the skin only  just, so that if you complained to your friend about it, he might  call you a pansy. “May I bring you anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  shook her head. “I don’t think so. I’m really not hungry, you  know that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endo  shook his head.  “Uh-uh. I’m paying, so you’re eating.” (<em>He’s  actually kind of pushy, </em>Sei thought.) “Order whatever  you’d like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  couldn’t help but huff a bit.  After a moment, she glanced at her  menu, ignored for most of the time they’d been there, and said,  “One teriyaki burger, well-done, please, with rice instead of  french fries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  waiter nodded, and then looked at Kunikuda, who, after careful  deliberation, ordered the exact same thing. This bought them once again  respite from his icy presence, and she was a little grateful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stared at each other for a long moment then, and Kunikuda said, “So.  You were going to tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  you what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  smiled at her.  “Whatever your little heart desires, I believe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  sighed, knowing what he meant, and then looked back up at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, just as she opened her mouth to tell him, <em>I’m a lesbian  and I’m afraid of what my classmates might do to me, socially or  otherwise, if they find out because half of them are nothing more  than narrow-minded pieces of trash, and so I need to go out on a date  with a guy so that they'll think that I’m straight but just shy, but I’m  fucking it all up because the truth is I’m scared witless of most  men because we all fear what we know nothing about and I’ve been  with nothing but girls since I was five and my dad was a bastard and  so I didn’t know any good men and you’re taking me all off-guard  and I’m really glad you are because I think I like you too but not  in that way because I play for the other team you know I hope you  understand, </em>the restaurant’s doors opened, a motion which her  eyes just happened to catch, and Yumi Fukuzawa walked through them  and went into the bar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  she stopped dead. The bottom dropped out of her stomach, and every  single part of her except her body left the table in that instant,  reaching out for that happy, perky, expressive girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Y…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yumi. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi.</span></p>
