<h1>Something to Believe (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a>

<a href="../marimite/sumbelieve-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>After some wandering and a few strategic questions, Yumi managed to 
locate Touko on the school stage, working on the set for the latest 
drama club production. The doors opened with a loud creak, causing Yumi 
to wince as they announced her presence. Touko looked up from her work, 
curls bouncing and wearing a smile which slowly faded as she 
acknowledged Yumi&#39;s presence.

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; Touko greeted coolly.

Sighing quietly and knowing she should have expected as much, Yumi 
mustered up her courage and offered Touko her brightest smile. &quot;I&#39;ve 
come to speak with Touko-chan about some very important matters,&quot; 
revealed Yumi, bouncing back and forth on her heels and looking up at 
Touko who stood above her on the stage.

&quot;Important matters require an audience, I see,&quot; remarked Touko, nodding 
her head.

&quot;Ehh?&quot; Yumi made a noise of pure confusion and followed Touko&#39;s gaze 
which was focused on a fairly significant crowd of students staring at 
them from the entrance to the stage area. She wearily noted most of them 
were the ones she had stopped to ask questions about Touko&#39;s 
whereabouts. Turning back she noticed that Touko was packing up her 
things and she called out anxiously, &quot;Touko-chan&#133;&quot;

&quot;If you want us to have an audience when we speak then we must get 
closer to them, Yumi-sama,&quot; said Touko, regarding the other students 
with a clinical gaze. Shifting her book bag from one hand to the other, 
her curls bounced as she walked and her lips curled up in a smile that 
held no happiness. &quot;They can&#39;t hear us from that distance. And you must 
prove how much you love your cute and charming Touko-chan, isn&#39;t that 
so?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Yumi firmly and Touko&#39;s smile grew a little more twisted, 
causing Yumi to reflect on her words. Shaking her head fiercely, she 
looked at Touko who stood in front of her wearing a face of blatant 
disinterest. &quot;I want to speak to you alone. I didn&#39;t mean for them to 
follow me. But I just wanted to find you as quickly as I could so I 
began asking whoever I could find where you were.&quot;

Touko&#39;s eyes were lidded in thought then she said quietly, &quot;Why is that, 
Yumi-sama?&quot;

&quot;Not here, I want to speak to you in private,&quot; Yumi replied. Hesitating 
a moment, she reached out and took Touko&#39;s hand in her own, looking 
forward as she did. Unable to see the look of surprise Touko wore at 
this. Yumi calmly led them through the crowd of students then stopped to 
face them. Her expression was kind but resolute as she said, &quot;Thank you 
for helping me find Touko-chan but please don&#39;t follow us.&quot;

Then she turned and walked away with Touko at her side, ignoring the 
calls that met her words. After a minute or so, she peeked over her 
shoulder and gave a sigh of relief on seeing they had no one following 
them and the crowd of students was dispersing. It was then that Touko 
snapped out of her temporary daze and shook her hand free of Yumi&#39;s 
grasp who frowned at this. A light blush covering her features, Touko 
said stiffly, &quot;I&#39;m perfectly capable of following you on my own, 
Yumi-sama. You don&#39;t need to hold my hand to guide me.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Yumi said, her gaze warm and welcoming. Debating it for a 
moment and deciding it was worth the possibility of another rejection, 
Yumi gently took Touko&#39;s hand in her own again. &quot;But I want to hold 
Touko-chan&#39;s hand.&quot; Turning on her heel, she swallowed hard and waited 
for Touko to pull her hand away again. Only it never came and Yumi could 
swear she felt the slightest hint of a squeeze. Not hard and harsh but 
tender and full of care. Sighing happily, Yumi led them to the area 
surrounding Lillian Academy and towards a small grove she had discovered 
in her first year. Not only was it beautiful and peaceful, it was 
wonderfully isolated. Yumi stood in the center circle which was absent 
of trees and the sunlit poured down on her features, highlighting her 
anxiety as she faced Touko. Instinctively reaching for the girl&#39;s other 
hands, she stared down at them as she said, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have spoken to 
Mami-san. That article was an invasion of your privacy.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you do it?&quot; demanded Touko, her voice strangely low and 
even.

Lifting her eyes, Yumi gave a wan smile. &quot;I wanted to prove to 
Touko-chan how much I wanted her as my petite soeur. Although,&quot; Yumi 
released a nervous laugh. &quot;I now think I did a poor job of it.&quot;

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; whispered Touko. Squeezing her eyes shut, she shook her 
head then gazed at the older girl with a disbelieving stare. &quot;Why would 
did you think an article would accomplish that?&quot;

&quot;I thought that it would be like shouting the words out to the entire 
school,&quot; Yumi confessed, keeping her eyes fixed on her hands that 
continued to hold Touko&#39;s. Her fingers lightly caressed the softness of 
the other girl&#39;s skin and she found herself entranced by the sensation. 
Shrugging her shoulders lamely, Yumi continued, &quot;I&#39;d be telling everyone 
how I&#39;ve chosen Touko-chan as my petite soeur and it would prove to you 
how proud I was of that.&quot; Reluctantly tugging her hands from Touko&#39;s, 
she formed a melancholy smile. &quot;I understand now that I was forcing my 
feelings onto you and that wasn&#39;t fair. Just because I want you as my 
petite soeur doesn&#39;t mean you will ever feel the same way.&quot; Touko 
started to speak but Yumi stepped forward, gently pressing her index 
finger against yielding lips. &quot;Let me finish.&quot; When Touko nodded 
silently, Yumi smiled again then continued, &quot;That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m 
giving up. I mean it when I say I want Touko-chan for my petite soeur. 
But I&#39;m going to try and not bother you too much with my pursuits. And,&quot; 
Yumi closed her eyes and seemed to be steeling herself for something 
terrible. &quot;All you need to do is tell me to stop trying and I promise I 
will.&quot;

Silence.

The rustling of leaves, the chirping of birds, the loud beating of her 
heart but no words came from Touko and Yumi felt the tears begin to fall 
before she could help herself. She pulled her hands away from Touko to 
angrily wipe them away but was stopped by a firm grip around her wrist. 
Blinking in confusion, Yumi didn&#39;t dare to move as Touko reached out and 
wiped the tears away with the pads of her thumbs. A wry smile graced her 
features and her hair bounced as she tilted her head to one side.

&quot;Yumi-sama is a delicate creature, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Touko remarked, gently 
teasing.

&quot;Touko-chan?&quot; Yumi breathed, hope shining through.

Lightly tracing her thumbs down until they fell away from the older 
girl&#39;s skin, Touko murmured, &quot;Do as you like. I won&#39;t stop Yumi-sama 
from enjoying her pursuits.&quot;

&quot;Touko-chan!&quot; Yumi&#39;s released a cry of happiness as she swept the other 
girl up in her arms.

Several moments passed and Touko was rigid in Yumi&#39;s embrace but 
eventually something relaxed in her and she loosely returned the hug. 
Yumi tucked her head into the crook of the younger girl&#39;s neck and gave 
a laugh of pure joy, unable to believe this was truly happening. When 
the warmth of her breath struck Touko&#39;s skin, she noticed the visible 
shiver it caused and with it, Yumi realized as much as Touko might 
protest when she showed physical affection she did enjoy it. She had to 
go slowly though, she couldn&#39;t scare Touko off again. Knowing this, Yumi 
pulled back and smiled sweetly at the other girl.

&quot;Thank you for giving me a chance,&quot; said Yumi earnestly.

Reddening a bit, Touko scowled. &quot;I&#39;m just letting Yumi-sama do as she 
likes,&quot; she protested.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Yumi conceded, bending down to pick up their book bags which 
they dropped on the grass. She peered up at Touko and offered a playful 
grin. &quot;But I&#39;m thankful for anything that has to do with Touko-chan.&quot;

Touko stiffly took her bag from Yumi and whirled around to face away 
from the older girl. A few seconds passed then she stuck her hand 
backwards in an awkward offering. &quot;We&#39;ll be late for class,&quot; Touko 
stated, the tips of her ears turning pink. Smiling widely at this, Yumi 
eagerly took Touko&#39;s hand and followed her back to the school.

She was well aware this would cause more gossip and curiosity and she 
simply didn&#39;t care because the only thing that mattered was Touko. That 
and the fact Touko hadn&#39;t outright rejected Yumi as her grande soeur.

Something that made this a very good day indeed.</pre>
