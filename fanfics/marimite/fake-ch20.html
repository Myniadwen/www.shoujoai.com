<p align="center"><em>So I ache.</em></p>
<hr />
<p align="center">Voice</p>
<p>It  was really a lot easier to talk tough than it was to come up with a  plan. Sei knew that from experience (the only way one really came to  understand anything) but Yoshino was still learning, which was perhaps  why she became so utterly disheartened about halfway through their  drive back to Tokyo, when the realization fell over the car that nobody  had even the foggiest as to what they could do to help Sachiko, because  none of them could really quantify what<em> helping </em>her would entail.</p>
<p>In  the end, all they accomplished was putting Yoshino in a state near to  tears. She seemed to have taken Sachiko’s case to heart, and as much as  Rei tried to reassure her that they’d come up with something, the fact  was that she didn’t believe it herself. The prospect of <em>busting into Sachiko’s place and telling her to grow a pair </em>was nice, but it inherently had several major flaws, not the least of which being the fact that <em>busting into Sachiko’s place </em>was breaking and entering, and they couldn’t <em>tell her to grow a pair </em>in  jail. Yoshino, attempting to invoke Occam’s razor, at one point  suggested that they simply ask to be let in, but it was quickly pointed  out that Suguru would almost certainly not allow it, and it seemed to  Sei like he more or less ran the house at this point. Sachiko’s parents  seemed to be generically <em>away, </em>and as annoying as it was, none  of them had the slightest idea where they were. Not that the parents  would be much help in any event—they were the ones who had set up the  marriage in the first place.</p>
<p>Shimako suggested trying to call  Sachiko on the phone, a suggestion which had facilitated what was  probably the most logical, constructive discussion, until Yumi pointed  out that the household had somebody who answered the phone—almost  certainly to screen their calls—and you couldn’t really say difficult  things on the phone anyway. In all honesty, Yumi wasn’t sure if she  could even say them in person. That was why they were difficult.</p>
<p>All  they could really come up with was that Sachiko would need to take some  sort of initiative, and that lead them into the same corner they were  so utterly used to.</p>
<p>And so, Yoshino could not help but become disheartened and frustrated, along with the rest of them, to varying degrees.</p>
<p>All, that is, but Yumi.</p>
<p>Rei  thought it curious—but perhaps a bit promising—that of all of them,  Yumi was the only one who did not have a small drag in their step as  they were let off at their individual houses.</p>
<p>After all, in the  end, for all their scheming, this would probably be something to be  resolved between Yumi and Sachiko themselves. It was hard to admit,  even to herself; certainly she’d never be able to convince Yoshino of  it. But that was how it was. Getting involved in somebody else’s life,  somebody else’s business, only went so far; she’d done her fair share  of it on the Rose Council, who had essentially been the school’s  chartered meddlers, but she felt that that experience had given her a  perspective on the prospect of meddling: That it was more for the  benefit of the meddler than anyone else.</p>
<p><em>But then, how do you justify Sachiko’s case to yourself? </em>She  wondered as she hugged Yoshino goodbye, saw her in the door of her  house, and then headed for her own home—she had moved out not long ago,  into a dormitory on the Tokyo University campus. <em>Here is a girl who  really needs somebody to interfere in her life, who has a hard time  taking control by herself. How can you say that by stepping in and  involving yourself in her business, you’re </em>not <em>doing her a  favor? Certainly if you keep doing that she’ll never learn to walk on  her own two feet, it’s true, but is this really the time to be teaching  her to walk? This is marriage we’re talking about here. It’s not her  first bike ride. </em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, are we really  accomplishing anything? Marriage isn’t the end of the world for her;  God knows Suguru isn’t going to be putting any pressures on her, so to  speak. At the very least, he isn’t going to stop her. I don’t know </em>everything <em>that’s  going on in their lives, but if Suguru is allowed to take lovers,  Sachiko can’t be expected to simply wait in their house for him to come  along and grace her with his attentions. Especially if his attentions  don’t even swing in the general direction of Sachiko. </em></p>
<p><em>Maybe you’re too rational for that, though. Certainly it’s the case that most everybody that </em>you <em>know  wouldn’t object to at least some semblance of fairness in their  relationship, but look at Sachiko’s mother. Unless I’m very blind, she  hasn’t taken a lover in years, if ever; she still thinks the world of  Sachiko’s father. Does that mean she’s not allowed to take one? Or just  that she hasn’t chosen to? </em></p>
<p>Rei stopped at a stoplight,  rolled her window down, and stuck her arm out, grabbing onto the roof  of the car. Not the most ladylike move on the planet, but who was going  to know? Everybody had to relax sometimes, and she enjoyed the feeling  of the wind on her arm, even in the summer heat.</p>
<p>The light turned  a few moments later, and she accelerated gently towards the speed  limit, enjoying the feeling of the wind at her arm.</p>
<p><em>Now, if  Yoshino had been in the car, yes, I might be able to do something like  this, and maybe Sei as well, but nobody else. There’s nothing logically  wrong with sticking one’s arm out the window; it’s simply not what’s  expected of me. Or rather, I’m expected not to do it. Because it’s  polite, right? And somebody like Sachiko might be surprised to see me  like this. Just sticking my arm out the window, like a  nineteen-year-old boy with his first car. It’s not especially rude, and  if she thought about it, she would have to understand that I’m not  always polite and ladylike when nobody else is around. It’s not a  definition of a person, after all. It’s an act around other people. </em></p>
<p><em>To what end?</em></p>
<p><em>If I knew that, I’d be able to fake it. It’s exhausting being a lady. I don’t even </em>like <em>skirts. </em></p>
<p>She  stopped at another light. They were not on her side today. A band was  playing on the street corner, just three boys on instruments and a girl  with a lovely demure voice singing a demure song about a lover whom she  didn’t understand.</p>
<p>She tapped her hand on the hood of her car in  time with the drums. It was a very good song, and as the light changed  again, something occurred to her.</p>
<p><em>…What if she wouldn’t understand it?</em></p>
<p><em>What if she’s like that </em>all <em>the time? Even at home?</em></p>
<p><em>That’s absurd. </em></p>
<p><em>Maybe  she doesn’t even understand that she has options. Maybe even if  somebody tells her that, she doesn’t take it in. Maybe actions don’t  speak any more loudly than words for her. Certainly she’s grown as a  person—she even went so far as to allow herself to ogle Yumi when she  thought nobody was looking—but maybe that’s something that she can’t  quite get. Maybe she thinks it’s something she sees on TV, but only  really exists in the collective imagination, like True Love Which  Conquers Even Death or a pill that can make a man larger. </em></p>
<p><em>After  all, if she grew up with none, how could she learn them? You don’t  learn options. They’re given to you and you learn how to choose between  them, but if they’re never given to you, how can you familiarize  yourself with such a concept without help? Or even </em>with <em>help? </em></p>
<p><em>So  then…what? What does that do for you? Do you just step in and make her  decision for her? That’s not right. Even if I could do it, I wouldn’t. </em></p>
<p><em>Maybe …</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe she needs somebody to present her with a decision like that. To sit her down and tell her, </em>okay, this is your choice now. Make it, <em>with a completely neutral stance. Not acting as anybody’s agent but their own. </em></p>
<p><em>Kind of like asking somebody out.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re  not doing it for anybody but you. You’ve made your choice, and so it’s  up to whoever you’re asking out to make theirs, and that’s that. In the  end, they have to make a selfish choice, and that’s how you know  they’re being honest. </em></p>
<p>The Tokyo University campus was  crowded, but mystically, it was never hard for Rei to get through in a  car. The students obeyed traffic laws, which Rei thought was absolutely  absurd, but nonetheless thanked God for; if they simply meandered about  the streets as they pleased she’d never get anywhere. She pulled into a  parking spot near her dormitory (which was co-ed; something it had  taken her a hell of a long time to get used to) and after a moment,  rolled the window up and got out of the car. Her arm felt a bit funky  from hanging it out of the window for so long, and it was certainly  warmer than the rest of her body from being in the sun. She rubbed it a  bit, then locked her car, and began walking towards her room.</p>
<p>She was halfway there when she simply stopped.</p>
<p><em>And that is why Yumi is not nervous. Or at least, not nervous about the same thing that we are. She understood that already.</em> <em>She understands what it takes to force a selfish decision. </em></p>
<p><em>And we can do precisely nothing.</em></p>
<p><em>For now, anyway. </em></p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Rei needed a nap, badly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sachiko  had no trouble readjusting to having a role—none which could be  perceived without paying attention, anyway. Nearly as soon as she  exited the car and crossed the twenty feet towards the large  double-doors of her house, her morose exterior seemed to melt off like  so much sweat, dripping down her neck, down her side, snaking down her  thighs, and finally being left on the ground behind her. She walked  slowly and purposefully up the stairs, occasionally adjusting the  crease of her jeans in place of a skirt that she did not wear. She  bowed and thanked politely the man who opened the door for her, removed  her shoes at the entryway, and murmured <em>I’m home </em>to a house which was not empty but may as well have been.</p>
<p><em>It echoes.</em></p>
<p><em>It fucking echoes. </em></p>
<p><em>A house should not echo. </em></p>
<p><em>Many people would give their firstborn child and every one after it to be able to afford a house that could echo. </em>It was a line read off a script at this point. <em>Don’t  question your wealth, you’re lucky to have it. That’s what makes a  person lucky is money; never mind the ability to have a normal life or  marry anybody they please or hell even just ogle anybody they please,  or rather anybody who pleases them, it’s MONEY that makes a person  lucky, MONEY and nothing else. Just money, if you have that it’s all  you need then you can have all the male suitors you want so long as you  pick one who won’t love you. No, you’re </em>lucky <em>to have that. Because there’s money mixed in with it. </em></p>
<p><em>They can have it. They can goddamn </em>have <em>it.  I don’t goddamn want it. Who the hell even asked me? Let’s just open up  the damn doors and let every bum who wants a piece take a room. Let’s  wait on them. I’ll find another place to live. I’ll take one of their  names. One of them can be Sachiko Ogasawara, and I’ll be –</em></p>
<p><em>Stop it. </em></p>
<p>Sachiko  found that her hands were clenched together powerfully, her nails  digging painfully into her palms. Her mouth was twitching slightly. She  felt something burning in her chest, and wondered for a moment if she  would have a heart attack, but the feeling passed as she steadied  herself.</p>
<p>Suguru followed her up the stairs and passed her without  a word. None of the doormen moved to help her or even asked her if  anything was wrong. No blood, no report, that was how it was in this  house, just like the damn Self Defense Forces.</p>
<p>It had never bothered her before. She had never really thought of one of the doormen lending a steadying hand, much less Suguru.</p>
<p>And then she thought of Yumi.</p>
<p>And of Sei.</p>
<p>And of goddamn <em>all of them. </em>All  of them who had guided her, who had given her a steadying hand or a  steadying hug or a steadying talk or a steadying glass of beer or a  steadying kiss. People who had lifted the weight of being Sachiko off  of Sachiko’s shoulders, who had all carried it with her.</p>
<p><em>That sounds pathetic. </em></p>
<p><em>Isn’t  that what everybody needs, though? Doesn’t Rei help Yoshino with that  every damn day? Haven’t I helped Yumi with being Yumi in the past? Why  is it so wrong, wanting somebody to help you be you without collapsing?  Parents help you be you. Friends help you to be you. Apparently  doormen, even ones whom you’ve known for years don’t, and apparently  fiancés don’t. Apparently people who talk to you at parties and try to  put their hands up your skirt don’t. </em></p>
<p><em>Fuck all of you.</em></p>
<p><em>Fuck every last one of you. You may all burn in hell.</em></p>
<p>She was clenching her hand again.</p>
<p>This time there <em>was </em>blood,  and a stinging pain. Her fingernails were not entirely clean, and she  did not know why, but she knew she would have to have somebody  disinfect them.</p>
<p>There was blood, but still no report. The doormen closed the door and left with a respectful bow.</p>
<p><em>I’ll do it myself.</em></p>
<p>She  started walking into the house, and made it about twenty yards before  she realized she had no idea where her family kept disinfectant.</p>
<p>It  took her twenty minutes to calm herself down to the point where she  thought she’d be able to ask for help in a tone of voice which was <em>not </em>an angry snarl. It took her ten more to get her voice soft enough to address somebody else.</p>
<p><em>(Calm down, Sachiko.)</em><em><br />
  (There  is no reason to be angry. Even if there is, there is no utility to it.  You’ll get places with your wealth and your face and your gentle  persona, not your anger, remember that. Nobody wants to hear what you  think of the Fukuda’s economic gaffes; they want to hear what you think  of the drapes. Just think of the drapes and the rugs and the night’s  dinner.)</em><em><br />
    (God sometimes I just want to put my fist through a)<br />
    (Calm. Down.)</em></p>
<p>It  took her less than a minute to convince the man she’d asked for help to  let her disinfect her own wounds. She said she’d gotten them falling in  Kyoto, and stuck to her story, even though it was completely absurd—if  nothing else, the small cuts in her palm <em>looked </em>like nail  marks, and her fingernails had blood under them. It was a testament to  how little anybody in this house gave a good goddamn that the man, who  had worked for the Ogasawaras for five years, gave in so quickly and  left Sachiko to her own devices.</p>
<p>Sachiko dumped hydrogen peroxide  over her hand over the sink, and it hurt. A lot. She was not used to  physical pain, and tears welled up in her eyes as she bit her lip.  Small white fuzz bubbled up on the four identical cuts on her palm, and  she rinsed it off and did it again. It hurt a bit less this time. She  repeated the process about four times, and by the last she was used to  the pain. She put the brown, unassuming bottle of peroxide away and  bandaged her hand with bandages the man had given her, and then stood,  clearing her mind. This had been an unpleasant experience and she did  not want to repeat it. She would keep her hands very flat against her  side whenever she could.</p>
<p>And even so, anger burned inside of her.</p>
<p>Her  mother called her later that day and chastised her for “running off  with her friends so irresponsibly when she has a life to consider.”  Sachiko sat quietly and nodded at all the right times, apologizing at  all the right times, even bowing at the wall once. It was another thing  she’d been drilled in, in case anybody was watching—though her friends  often did it inadvertently as well, it would not do for somebody  watching to think she was <em>abnormal.</em></p>
<p><em>God, I’ve got all those </em>in cases<em> down.</em></p>
<p>Afterward, her mother conveniently forgave her and told her she’d be around in an hour to try on dresses with her.</p>
<p>It  was strange, Sachiko thought as she hung up the phone and set herself  gently down on her bed. Her mother surely cared about her; she had been  very supportive and understanding when her grandmother had died. She  had even let Yumi see her in her grief, and comfort her. She had not  asked once for Sachiko to <em>please get up, clean up, and come support the family. </em></p>
<p>In truth, she knew she was cared about by her mother, but she could not help resenting it.<em><br />
  (You are resenting everything that you are handed, you undeserving bitch.)<br />
  Then take it away. Take it.</em><br />
  Why, though? Why resent it?<em><br />
    Because nobody asked you.</em><em><br />
      Nobody ever god damn asks you.</em><em><br />
        Who would? </em></p>
<p>Who would? Nobody really owned their own life, after all, so who would?</p>
<p><em>Then who </em>does <em>own my life? And then, what do I own? </em></p>
<p><em>You own power and wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>But what use is it without my life? And who made that trade?</em></p>
<p>Sachiko decided to stop thinking about it and sleep.</p>
<p>It didn’t go very well. She could not fall asleep, and she very nearly put four more neat cuts into her other palm.</p>
<p>A small muscle in her jaw began twitching and did not stop.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sachiko’s  mother arrived an hour later, on the dot, flanked by four men carrying  bundles of white, flowing dresses. Sachiko had roused herself and was  downstairs, trying to keep her bandaged hand behind her back as best  she could. She had also put on a skirt, reasoning that even if she was  wearing jeans she wouldn’t be allowed to keep that hand in her pocket.  She would have to keep them at her sides, or behind her back.</p>
<p>“I’ve  picked out quite a few for you to try on,” her mother said, brushing  past her, her pace very nearly fast, “so we’ll need to begin right  away. I want to have one chosen before your father gets home so you can  show him.”</p>
<p><em>She </em>had picked out.</p>
<p>Sachiko had not even gotten to look.</p>
<p><em>Of course not.</em></p>
<p>Sachiko  had always looked forward to picking out her wedding dress. She had  thought it would be wonderfully romantic, exciting, to go out with all  of her friends and spend the day choosing one. To not only try them on  herself, but to <em>gently prompt </em>Sei or perhaps Yumi to try one  on, to laugh at how embarrassed it made both of them, and finally to  watch them give. She wondered if she’d have been able to get Youko into  one, or maybe Rei. Yoshino would certainly enjoy seeing that.</p>
<p><em>(I could have seen Yumi in a wedding dress.)<br />
  (You bitch. You fucking bitch.)</em></p>
<p>Her nails dug into her bandaged palm again, extremely painfully.</p>
<p>She very nearly enjoyed it. It was the only thing that kept her jaw from twitching.</p>
<p>She  tried on almost fifteen dresses over the course of the next four hours,  each one done up in its entirety by a team of several women, all with  blank faces. Sachiko’s mother gave her opinion on each one, and, for  politeness’ sake, listened to Sachiko’s opinion and ignored it.</p>
<p>Sachiko  felt that none of them were quite right. To her it sounded silly—after  all, a dress was a dress, wasn’t it? And many of them—including the one  that her mother summarily chose after the last one was loosened and  dropped to the floor, leaving Sachiko standing in her underwear for the  first time in a very long time—looked very flattering on her. She would  look beautiful in them.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t what she wanted.</p>
<p>It was silly; that was what she would be told, anyway, but it wasn’t <em>her </em>wedding dress. And if it wasn’t <em>hers, </em>what was the damn point? Wasn’t she the one getting married?</p>
<p><em>To a man who doesn’t love you.</em></p>
<p><em>To a man who </em>can’t <em>love you.</em></p>
<p><em>Be reasonable, Sachiko, which part of this </em>is <em>your wedding? You didn’t want this. You didn’t choose any of this. What’s the point in complaining about your </em>dress<em>, of all things?</em></p>
<p>It took her not long at all to recognize the voice of her mother, speaking to her once again inside of her head.</p>
<p>And yet, she could not simply accept that.</p>
<p>Not like before.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>But  what could she do? She may have forgotten it for a brief, happy period,  but her life was not her own. It belonged to the Ogasawara Group. The  Ogasawara Group employed a great many people, made her family wealthy  and powerful, and provided a great many necessary services to a great  many people who needed them. And for some reason, all of it seemed  right now to hinge on <em>her </em>marrying Suguru so that their entire  system would continue. Their bizarre, unreasonable system of  lineage-based leadership. Her father ran the Ogasawara Group now, as  his father and grandfather before him had.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn’t a company be run on the basis of ability, not of lineage? </em></p>
<p><em>Doesn’t that make sense?</em></p>
<p>Maybe  she thought so, but obviously the leadership of the Ogasawara Group  disagreed. And why wouldn’t they? Admitting what she admitted would  mean that they might lose their hold on the company. Let the board and  the stockholders elect the next president. Then it would be the  Ogasawara Group only in name, and, horror of all horrors, some later  generation of Ogasawaras might actually have to find legitimate jobs.  An Ogasawara <em>woman </em>might actually hold a job. An Ogasawara man  might turn out not to be the president of a company, but a writer or a  teacher. Their vaunted wealth and power would fade, probably not in the  lifetimes of the men and women who feared it, but in their children’s  lifetimes.</p>
<p>And that would be horrible, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Aren’t </em>I <em>their child?</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t think it’s horrible.</em></p>
<p><em>I could give this house and this wealth up in an instant.</em></p>
<p><em>You  have many cousins who would not mind taking it up in your stead. Isn’t  Suguru one of them? Isn’t this only to secure his place among all of  the other male cousins who might want to control the company? Isn’t  this just preventing a power struggle, then? </em></p>
<p>But if Suguru  was really cut out to lead the company…and he was, there was no  question of that in her mind—whatever else he was, he was smart and he  was shrewd, and he was kind enough that he would not run it  cruelly—shouldn’t emerge in the top of a power struggle anyway?</p>
<p><em>But it would be destructive.</em></p>
<p><em>And mother would never allow it.</em></p>
<p><em>What could she do?</em></p>
<p><em>She  could cut me off. She could kick me out. She could disown me. She  might. If she didn’t, father would. I would be thrown into the world  with nothing at all, and then within years I would become one of those  people who would trade their firstborn for what I used to have. That,  too is an awful fate.</em></p>
<p>Then, what?</p>
<p>She didn’t know.</p>
<p>She just didn’t know.</p>
<p>She  felt tired all at once. She very nearly collapsed, but managed to sit  on the floor instead. Her mother looked up immediately and snapped,  “Sachiko! What are you doing? Are you an animal?”</p>
<p>“I’m tired, mother,” she murmured. “I didn’t feel that I could stand any longer.”</p>
<p>“Then  be tired on a chair,” her mother said. Her mother’s voice masked  irritation, but Sachiko heard an undertone of concern that made her  feel a bit better. One of the women who had helped Sachiko try on  dresses brought a chair over and tried to help Sachiko into it. Sachiko  was expected to take her help, but did not, standing of her own power  instead, and verily flopping into the chair, still dressed in only her  underwear. It was the very picture of laziness, and she was surprised  her mother allowed it.</p>
<p>Her mother went back to what she had been  doing, helping one of the women hang the dress up properly, cover it in  plastic, and store it. The other women gathered up the “rejected” (not  that Sachiko had rejected them) dresses and put them in boxes. Sachiko  doubted her mother was going to attempt to return them. What was the  point?</p>
<p>After they had finished, the women left the room with the  boxes and Sachiko’s mother was alone with her, still fiddling with the  dress, her face all at once a bit wistful. It took Sachiko only a few  moments to realize why her mother had made the selection she did, and  she felt a tug at her heart.</p>
<p><em>Mother has not had it any easier than I have, has she?</em></p>
<p>There  was silence between them for a moment, and then her mother said,  “Sachiko, put some clothes on. You look ridiculous,” very quietly.</p>
<p><em>That is no reason for her to push it on me, damn it.</em></p>
<p>“Mother,” Sachiko murmured, her voice very tired.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p><em>What are you doing?<br />
  </em><em>I want to say it.</em><em><br />
    You can’t say it, you stupid girl. You can not say it.</em><em><br />
      I have to say it.<br />
  </em><em>You can’t. Shut the hell up, right now. Put some clothes on.<br />
  </em><em>I’m going to say it.<br />
  </em><em>You are being ridiculous.</em><em><br />
    Then I’ll be ridiculous. I need to say it. I can’t not even have my voice heard.<br />
    Why the hell not? That’s what your life </em>is.<br />
  <em>I can’t do it. I just … can’t.<br />
</em><em>Like hell you can’t. Shut up.</em></p>
<p>“You what?” Sachiko’s mother turned to face her.<em><br />
  DO NOT</em><br />
  “I don’t want to go through with this.”</p>
<p>Sachiko’s throat felt so tight that she wondered how she was able to breathe.<em><br />
  YOU FUCKING IDIOT TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW.</em><br />
  Her mother sighed. “It’s a big step.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean, and you know it.”</p>
<p>“Watch your tone,” her mother snapped automatically.</p>
<p>“Mother. Please. You know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Her  mother looked around a bit, and then walked over to Sachiko and put a  hand on her bare shoulder. The touch felt good—Sachiko had forgotten  that her mother could be a very gentle woman. After a moment, she put a  hand on Sachiko’s other shoulder, and squeezed a bit.</p>
<p><em>Was that a hug?</em></p>
<p>She much preferred Yumi’s.</p>
<p>“I know,” her mother whispered. “But this is the burden that you, as a woman, must bear.”</p>
<p>It was Sei’s voice that rang in her head this time: <em>That’s a crock of shit, and you know it.</em></p>
<p>“To marry a man who doesn’t love me?”</p>
<p>“Suguru loves you.”</p>
<p>“Not as I need him to.”</p>
<p>“He will come to. He is a man, after all, and has his needs.”</p>
<p><em>So then, does father love his mistresses as well? </em></p>
<p>She held that biting comment back.</p>
<p>“This isn’t right, mother. You know it.”</p>
<p>“Watch your tone,” the older woman snapped again. “You don’t know what I know. Not by quite a bit.”</p>
<p><em>I wish you’d tell me.</em></p>
<p><em>I  wish somebody would GOD DAMN tell me what it is that I don’t know that  justifies this. That justifies taking my mother fucking </em>LIFE <em>away from me. </em></p>
<p>Sachiko nearly cried out in pain as her cut palm reopened under the pressure of her nails.</p>
<p>“There are just things we have to do, is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, something like that,” her mother said vaguely.</p>
<p>Sachiko thought <em>that </em>to be a crock of shit. Certainly everybody had things they had to do.</p>
<p>This was not one of them, though.</p>
<p>She  didn’t give a flying fuck about company leadership. She just didn’t.  The Ogasawaras were richer than God. If they sold their massive house  and lived like every other person in Tokyo, their family would not have  to even <em>work </em>for something like twenty generations before the  money began to run a bit low, barring some massive-scaled economic  collapse. By playing in the stock market, or in the world market, they  could double that number. Money on the scale that they had money on  practically increased itself. Sachiko could, on the spot, think of ten  ways to grow their money each year by a sum large enough to support an  upper-middle class family living in Tokyo. Several, even.</p>
<p>And then a thought that never occurred to Sachiko before occurred to her:</p>
<p>She was <em>smart.</em></p>
<p>This…very nearly floored her.</p>
<p><em>I’m…smart.</em></p>
<p>Certainly she had never thought she was stupid; she had always made excellent grades in school. But <em>this?</em></p>
<p><em>Hell, I could make it on my own. Couldn’t I?</em></p>
<p><em>Could I?</em></p>
<p>“I think we’re done, mother,” she said quietly. “It’s clear to me that I have no say in this matter, nor have I ever.”</p>
<p>It came out harshly. Angrily. Her hand let up a bit on her palm.</p>
<p>“Sachiko, watch your—”</p>
<p>“Tone,  I know. I’m watching my tone, and my face, and every other piece of me,  as always. As you taught me. I’m just pointing out that I have no say  in whom I will marry, so I should probably not have a say in anything  relating to it.”</p>
<p>“You are being childish. When you say it like that, it sounds awful.”</p>
<p>“It does, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Sachiko stood, pulling loose of her mother.</p>
<p>She felt something swelling inside her that she had never felt before.</p>
<p><em>Resolve. </em></p>
<p>She  pulled pants on quickly, savoring the feeling of the denim gliding over  her skin. It felt different than it had before. It felt <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>She pulled a shirt on.</p>
<p>She walked out.</p>
<p>Her mother said not a word of protest. Perhaps she believed Sachiko defeated, or herself defeated instead.</p>
<p>Sachiko  went to the bathroom and once again cleaned her cuts. The pain was less  intense this time. Maybe because her mind was preoccupied. She felt  focused. She saw ideas form in front of her eyes, and then vanish. She  had never felt like this before; school had been mostly rote  memorization, and so it had been easy to simply cram ideas into her  head and spit them back out on tests.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever really been challenged before?</em></p>
<p>She liked it.</p>
<p>God help her, she liked it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Her cell phone rang twenty minutes later. It was Yumi. Apparently, Yumi had<em> something she needed to talk to her about.</em></p>
<p>Sachiko  smiled and asked her to come over. When Yumi protested, Sachiko said,  “This is my house, Yumi. Nobody is going to stop you.”</p>
<p><em>That is not entirely true. </em></p>
<p><em>It’s close, though.</em></p>
<p>Mostly she just needed it resolved quickly. Before she lost this <em>resolve </em>that even filled up the hole of nerves in her stomach when Yumi’s tight, low voice told her that she had to talk about <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Resolve  was like a muscle, and part of her knew it. This was an unexercised  muscle in her body, and she would need to finish before it gave out.  Because it would give out.</p>
<p>It was just a matter of when, and if she could finish first or not.</p>
