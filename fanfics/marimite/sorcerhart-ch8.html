<h1>The Sorceress's Heart (part 8 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/andwick.html">Andwick</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sorcerhart-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p>Glossary: <i>Eiga</i>: splendor; pomp and circumstance; the need to put on an impressive 
show when an important festival rolls around. (The Christmas decorations in Bethlehem, 
Pennsylvania are an excellent example; if your town is called Bethlehem, then your Christmas 
decorations had <i>better</i> be good. And theirs are.) <i>Tanka</i>: a five-line poem, the 
first and third lines consisting of five syllables each, the second, fourth and fifth 
consisting of seven syllables each. Many of the poems the sorceresses have been using to 
direct their energies are <i>tanka, </i>though of course I've been doing them in English, 
and I gather the effect is very different. <i>Bo, ho, cho</i>: measures of distance, 
relevant only in the City -- one bo is the length of a city block, roughly 1/3 of a mile; 
one ho is 1/2 of a bo, and one cho is 1/2 of a ho. Easy-peasy.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>VII. 
The Wind That Shakes The Barley</p><p>The sun was low in the sky. Above, and in the east, a 
canopy of clouds had obscured everything, so that the sinking sun shone in from under a 
vast, impenetrable grey roof. The Western Market was filled with sly faces and nervous 
faces, as well as the occasional blank, unconcerned face. Shadows were long and deep between 
stalls and buildings.</p><p>Yumi set about to hide herself as best she could. She found a 
place between two storehouses where storage had overflowed and many goods were stacked in 
tiers or lying in heaps, with bits of cloth or leaves sticking out between the close ribs of 
rattan baskets. She slunk in the long shadows to avoid notice, and found a little cubby hole 
among the cases, tucked away out of sight. She folded herself up and hid her face in her 
knees.</p><p>Alone again.</p><p>It was worse this time, because the memories of her former 
friends, the friends she'd turned away from, tormented her. They'd all been so kind to her. 
Especially one.</p><p>She didn't know how she was going to live without 
Sachiko-sama.</p><p>That was silly, she knew it was. She wiped her eyes on the elbow-length 
sleeve of her tunic, which was already grimy, both with her many tears and with the dust of 
the city. She'd lived a whole life without even knowing who Sachiko-sama was until the day 
before yesterday. Still, she felt as if she'd torn half of herself off, leaving this new 
version of herself to just limp around the world, confused, and bleeding, and in 
pain.</p><p>But what else could she do?</p><p>She thought about Tsujimoto no Fujito. As much 
as she hated and feared him, she had to admit that it was thanks to him she'd been with 
Sachiko-sama even just for a couple of days, two days in springtime. She'd met Sachiko-sama 
on her own, granted, but had been too terrified by her to say anything. And she'd hurt 
herself on that stone running away from her, too...</p><p><i>Her foot had kept on throbbing 
after that. She'd spent the rest of the day limping from place to place along Red Bird 
Avenue and between the Eastern and Western Markets. She'd had no luck finding anyone who'd 
give her a little food and, after she became desperate, no luck stealing any either. The 
City was even more cold-hearted today than usual.</i></p><p><i>Finally, along about 
mid-evening, in the Western Market, she'd seen an opening, and</i> almost <i>succeeded in 
pinching a strip of fried meat from a vendor. She was weary and dizzy from hunger, and one 
moment she'd had her fingers on the meat, certain that his back was turned, and the next 
she'd been running for her life as he chased her with a cudgel, screaming unintelligibly -- 
mostly unintelligibly -- even fleeing in terror she could pick out the occasional word, such 
as "filth," "rat-farts," and "dog's breakfast," but she couldn't string them together into 
any kind of coherent sentence. Though she suspected she was going to be a "dog's breakfast" 
herself. He'd finally cornered her between two stalls. He'd got so overexcited it seemed 
he'd burst a vessel in his nose, and blood was running down into his sparse mustache and 
beard. His eyes had fairly glowed, he'd reared back with the cudgel screaming, and Yumi had 
darted out between his legs, with a speed and oiliness born of terror, and nudged his right 
leg enough as she went so that he lost his balance as he tried to turn and follow her, and 
she was just aware of him falling among some empty cases, shrieking 
curses.</i></p><p><i>She'd sped nimbly away, hoping to avoid other pursuers. But at the 
bottom of the block, in a little alleyway, leaning against a post and panting, it seemed 
that there was no pursuit -- and also that she had well-nigh exhausted herself. She would 
not have the energy for another such encounter tonight.</i></p><p><i>...but the longer she 
went without food, the less energy she would have for such encounters on any succeeding day. 
Sleep could only do so much --</i></p><p><i>"Good evening."</i></p><p><i>Three men were 
coming toward her, down the alley.</i></p><p><i>She felt like crying as she stood. She was 
tired. All she wanted was a little food, and a little sleep. Her chances of outrunning these 
men in her current state were not good. Well, crying wouldn't help anything either. She 
crouched there by the pillar, looking for an opening. There was only darkness further up the 
alley, and she couldn't be sure of an escape route that way. Her best way out was past these 
men... </i></p><p><i>"I saw that</i> remarkable <i>performance," said the tallest of the 
three men. He wore a headband and white robes. "I was most impressed. I should very much 
like to commission you to undertake a task of some danger and importance."</i></p><p><i>Yumi 
blinked. It wasn't as if the words were completely unfamiliar, but no one talked to her like 
that these days, and her brain was rusty.</i></p><p><i>"Moment, Tsuji-sama," said one of the 
other men. He stepped forward. "Hallo, sweetheart. I'm Ichiki. Ichiki the Twister, as I'm 
known among those in the know. Maybe you've heard of me?"</i></p><p><i>Yumi</i> had <i>heard 
whispers, here and there about the Market, of a notorious thief who went by that name. She 
nodded.</i></p><p><i>"Good! And I'm a little surprised I haven't heard of you, yet. I have 
never seen anyone move that fast, and I have seen some fast movers in my day, I am here to 
tell you. I'm reckoned pretty fast myself, in some quarters, and... Well, never mind. From 
your taking such a risk over a piece of food, I guess you're hungry, eh?"</i></p><p><i>Yumi 
nodded vehemently.</i></p><p><i>"As I thought. Well, Tsuji-sama here is of a mind to feed 
you. Only thing is, you've got to work for your food."</i></p><p><i>Yumi braced herself to 
flee. When men said "work for your food," they usually meant only one thing. This thing had 
never happened to her, but she had seen it happen to someone else once, and it wasn't 
happening to her if she could help it. She really thought she would rather die. Or... could 
these be demons? Thinking it over, they didn't look the sort of men who'd want her to "work 
for her food" in that wet, bloody, disagreeable way -- they weren't wealthy, but they looked 
comfortable enough to be able to afford a cleaner, better-dressed kind of woman.</i> If 
<i>they were men. Demons, now... the ones who would just sneak up on you and go for your 
liver were bad enough, but there were others who looked for some kind of subtle bargain. If 
they were offering her a little food in exchange for her letting them eat a little of her at 
a time -- like she was a lot of pickled fruit in their larder -- well. She was awfully 
hungry. Were there any parts of her body that she didn't particularly 
need?...</i></p><p><i>The Twister-san was laughing. "Girl, I wish I was a painter so's I 
could take all the different expressions that cross your face when you're thinking. 
Thinking</i> horrible <i>things, it looks like. How can you have that much gruesomeness to 
think on when I haven't even told you the offer yet?... Oi, Tsuji-sama, are you sure you 
wouldn't rather keep her as a pet? Hours of entertainment!..."</i></p><p><i>"Quite sure," 
said Tsuji-sama.</i></p><p><i>"Barrel o'laughs," Yumi could have sworn she heard Ichiki-san 
mutter as he turned back toward her. "Long story short, and so your face can relax more, we 
want to send you on an expedition. There's this young lady, lives at an inn not far from 
here. She is in possession of an item we'd like to have in our possession. Now, me and 
Shinji, we're skilled thieves. But this is a pretty particular expedition, and, well, the 
smaller and faster you are, the better your chances. You're small, and we've seen you're 
fast, as well as lucky. So we'd like to engage you for this easy, pleasant little job, and 
we will buy you a meal in exchange. Sound good?"</i></p><p><i>Yumi had tried stealing once 
today, and it hadn't helped anything. She wasn't good at stealing, as this Tsuji-sama seemed 
to think. She was good at running away, but that was different. And she was tired and 
hungry, enough so that she very much doubted that, if the scene of the market just now were 
repeated, she would be able to escape as before. But she was also tired and hungry enough to 
be desperate.</i></p><p><i>"Yes, I'll take the job, Masters, only... Can I have... a</i> 
little <i>food now?" she asked.</i></p><p><i>Ichiki-san looked at 
Tsuji-sama.</i></p><p><i>"Oh, no no no," said Tsuji-sama wisely. "I think not. No paying 
without work. I think that's sensible, don't you , Ich?"</i></p><p><i>"S'pose it is," 
Ichiki-san said.</i></p><p><i>The third man had said nothing and no-one had spoken to him. 
He appeared to be irritable and uninterested in anything much. He was the youngest of the 
three by a good bit, neither plain nor handsome. Yumi quickly saw that it was a matter of 
disinterest to him, whether she got fed or not. But he did occasionally stare at her 
suspiciously.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a bad moment once, later in the evening, when the 
lady's lights had gone out, but they were still waiting, for good measure. She'd been 
curling her toes in the dirt and sand of the alleyway by the porch, across the street from 
the Mountain Lily Inn. She was testing the muscles, the</i> <i>remembering</i> <i>muscles -- 
a reflex, when she was bored -- and she found that the young one was staring at her in 
horror. She stopped it at once, and did her best to pretend that there was nothing 
happening. The moment had passed.</i></p><p><i>The wait had been long, for the lady to go to 
bed so that she could do the theft. During, she did not become</i> less <i>weary and hungry, 
and she felt her chances of success diminish as her force did. She had thought this would 
happen, had thought of trying to explain that to these men, but Tsuji-sama had a cold, 
unapproachable look in spite of his constant smile. Waiting there under the eaves of the 
empty house she'd had a bad feeling about this business, but even if the lady woke up, well, 
all she had to do was run...</i></p><p>They had not mentioned that the lady was a sorceress. 
So possibility of failure and flight had become certainty of death, in that moment when 
dark, bloody light had filled the room and the sorceress had boomed at her, in the voice of 
a demon. And Yumi knew demons' voices, yes she did.</p><p>And then, Sachiko-sama had beheld 
her, in that light -- and Yumi's whole life had changed, right then.</p><p>What had 
Sachiko-sama seen in her face? Yumi still didn't know. The furious, terrifying look on 
Sachiko-sama's face had melted, softened into gentle amazement in the change of her burning 
hand from red to blue.</p><p>Another moment of fear, when Rei-sama had threatened her. But 
Sachiko-sama had protected her.</p><p>From then on, Yumi, tired and hungry and worried as 
she was, had been in a unique state of mind, best summed up in the phrase, <i>what you 
will</i>. Sachiko-sama had had mercy on her and protected her, and Sachiko-sama was the most 
wonderful living creature Yumi had ever seen. <i>What you will. I will do whatever you say, 
as long as I may stay here with you.</i></p><p>She hadn't expected it to be for long. Beyond 
the need to be with Sachiko-sama had been the growing conviction that she was all wrong for 
Sachiko-sama, and would only hold her back, drag her down. Sachiko-sama had to see this, 
sooner or later... probably had seen it by now. When Satou-sama told Sachiko-sama that Yumi 
had allowed herself to be ensorcelled, and then had been so ungrateful as to run away... 
Even if Yumi did go back to Sachiko-sama, she most likely wouldn't be welcome. And it was 
just as well --</p><p>Something slithered, in a nearby alleyway. Something big. The clever, 
oily sound went right to the marrow of Yumi's bones. <i>Not them again... please... not 
now...</i></p><p>She was on her feet. This was an awfully familiar situation. She had been 
running for much of the afternoon, she hadn't had a proper meal since morning (shaved ice 
with liana syrup, while indeed elegant and delicious, is curiously unfilling), and she was 
tired. But it seemed that she was never to be allowed any rest, any peace, for the rest of 
her existence, which was likely to be extremely brief --</p><p>"Yumi?" A low, gentle voice, 
like educated woodsmoke. A voice Yumi would know again anywhere, if even a thousand years 
had passed. Sachiko-sama's voice.</p><p>She nearly fell for it. In spite of the slither 
she'd heard only a moment ago, the voice was so artfully imitated that she had actually 
taken three running steps toward the alley mouth before her mind overruled her body and 
stopped its desperate hurling itself toward comfort, warmth, love, and sudden destruction. 
She almost overbalanced but managed to steady herself, her bare toes clutching at 
dust.</p><p>"Yumiii..."</p><p>The thing came out of the alley.</p><p>It knew it wasn't 
fooling anyone. It kept Sachiko-sama's form, but improvised on it as Yumi watched: the hair 
waving about it in windblown tendrils in spite of the still air; the eyes sunken and 
smoldering -- mostly blind, she knew, it relied on its ears and especially on its nose -- 
and the fingernails long, yellow, and caked with dirt. Its slow, measured, stiff, jerky 
steps were a crude jeering parody of Sachiko-sama's stately walk.</p><p>"Yumi," it crooned 
sweetly, twisting Yumi's heart around its voice, "come to me. I miss you, Yumi." Still 
Sachiko-sama's voice, but with a low growl in it, like a stalking cat.</p><p>Yumi backed 
away from the thing. She was weeping, but furious, and shaking her head. "Don't you dare -- 
use Sachiko-sama that way -- you are not worthy -- wearing her, like a gown -- she could tie 
you in knots, if she was here --"</p><p>"Oh, indeed?" the filthy thing purred happily. "I 
would like to see that... Take me to her."</p><p>Yumi tried to back further -- and felt 
constrained. A line, connecting her to the false goddess before her -- a leash?</p><p>A 
black thread. It shone with a terrible energy.</p><p>"You will take me to her," the beast 
cried, almost singing with joy in a baritone and an alto at the same time.</p><p>"No!" Yumi 
screamed. "No --"</p><p>It laughed, so that a long dog's tongue lolled horribly out of 
Sachiko-sama's mouth. Then it was holding a whip.</p><p>"Lead on," it said, and flicked the 
whip at Yumi's face --</p><p>-- and, with a speed and strength born of desperation, and of 
her terrible fury over the insult of the tongue, Yumi caught the whip, and yanked on it as 
hard as she could.</p><p>The Demon stumbled.</p><p>The constraint was gone.</p><p>And Yumi 
<i>ran</i>.</p><p>She was running west, it occurred to her, as she heard the gobbling rage 
of the thing pursuing her. The setting sun was straight ahead. She collected her thoughts as 
much as she could, with her death pursuing her, and the last sunset of her life staring her 
in the face. It began to rain, which did not help her concentration, and almost pushed her 
to the edge of despair, but she kept running. Maybe she could use the rain to her advantage 
somehow. But as soon as she could, she had to turn south. Then, at the City wall, east. She 
had to get out of the City. She was sure she had a better chance of escape and concealment 
outside the City, though all her chances were fading to nothing. But she had to get as far 
away from the Mountain Lily Inn as she could --</p><p>Her feet remembered, and left the 
ground --</p><p><i>The City was gone. The night was filled with shrieking shapes, some with 
banners stretched behind, all with songs that tried to pluck her head from off its sure 
perch, stabbing shrieks of fire between stars. Something yanked on her neck and she gasped 
for breath --</i></p><p>When her feet touched again, it was in the dust of Ninth Street, one 
bo to the south of where she had been. Just a few steps from the southern wall of the 
City.</p><p>Immediately, she turned eastward.</p><p>Her arm was stinging. From when she'd 
caught the whip, she realized. It might be bleeding, but she had no time to look. She heard 
the Demon howl with rage, away in the north. She seemed to have stretched the black thread 
that bound her to the thing. But unless she could break it somehow, the Demon would be able 
to find her. And as long as she was heading east and it was heading south, it would catch 
her soon. It would catch her soon wherever she went. She sobbed, and then controlled 
herself. If she wept now it would interfere with the measured breathing she needed to run. 
She had been a blind fool, and she had to get it away from Sachiko-sama. <i>One last game, 
then,</i> a voice said.<i> A game to see whether there will be more games, and a life to 
have them in.</i></p><p>--</p><p>In the main audience chamber of the Pure and Fresh Palace, 
a tall oil-lamp flared at either hand of the seated Emperor and the standing Fujiwara no 
Yukinaga. Before them, abased on the floor, was the disgraced and recusant Tsujimoto no 
Fujito. He was waiting to find out what ghastly thing they were going to do to him. There 
were two Imperial guards posted at the door, both in "silent death stance" mode with their 
rattan armor and flat conical hats, and their purple sashes. They were there to quell any 
local insurgency, should one insurge. The Emperor was thinking. Fujiwara no Yukinaga was 
there to help the Emperor to think. The Emperor wished his Uncle wouldn't try to be so 
helpful all the time.</p><p>"Of course, you <i>do</i> know the penalty for breaking your 
banishment," said Fujiwara no Yukinaga to the man on the floor. "It is death. So, in good 
sooth, there is really very little for us to talk about."</p><p>"I beg of you!" said a new 
voice.</p><p>Kashiwagi no Suguru came forward and prostrated himself next to Tsujimoto no 
Fujito. "I beg of you, your Imperial Majesty, do not kill him!..."</p><p>"Prince Suguru, you 
are treading on thin ice yourself," said Fujiwara no Yukinaga. "You knew he was in the 
Capital, and you chose not to notify the Imperial Guard? And how <i>long</i> have you 
known?"</p><p>"There is no defense I can make," Prince Suguru agreed, then hurried on, "Most 
wise and merciful Imperial Majesty, he was my aniki. Do you have an aniki, your 
Majesty?"</p><p>Fujiwara no Yukinaga gave a short, harsh laugh. "The Emperor has no need of 
such things."</p><p>The Emperor said nothing.</p><p>"I beg of you, imagine it, your 
Majesty," Suguru went on. "An older brother. One who gave you guidance and help when you 
most needed it. A friend and a counselor, the dearest, most important friend you ever had. 
To turn him in would be to cut out your own heart --"</p><p>"Turning your head would be one 
thing," said Fujiwara no Yukinaga. "You did more. You <i>colluded</i> with him. What I want 
to hear now is the full story of your collusion: what he was up to, what exactly you were 
helping him to do --"</p><p>"I hardly think that's necessary," mumbled the 
Emperor.</p><p>There was silence like a frozen lake at midwinter. Out of the corner of one 
eye, the Emperor saw that Prince Suguru had risked an upward glance but couldn't tell what 
he was looking at, and it was important that he not break eye contact with Uncle Lord 
Chancellor Fujiwara. This same Uncle glared in incomprehension at the young sovereign, who 
did his best to be nonchalant in spite of those eyes.</p><p>"I beg your pardon?" said the 
Lord Chancellor.</p><p>"I feel no real need to, er, inquire into this matter further, Lord 
Chancellor," said the Emperor, in a slightly stronger voice. "Whatever it was they were up 
to, they have been foiled. And I cannot help but notice that Prince Suguru seems strangely 
relieved about that. Though I don't have an aniki, I do understand the concept. From Prince 
Suguru's behavior, I suspect that Tsujimoto no Fujito laid an obligation upon him, used his 
position to force cooperation from him. That is yet another thing I should feel compelled to 
punish Tsujimoto no Fujito for. But Prince Suguru begs forgiveness for his aniki, and makes 
no cause of how his aniki ill-used him -- and I am minded to grant forgiveness."</p><p>"Your 
Majesty -- you may be unwilling to pass a sentence of... but really, you cannot just 
--"</p><p>"Perhaps not, but I'm doing it anyway," the Emperor said coldly. He stood, in a 
swirl of robes, and when the Lord Chancellor opened his mouth again, the Emperor slashed a 
hand at the air between them... and the Lord Chancellor's mouth closed. In a very tight 
line.</p><p>"Tsujimoto no Fujito," the Emperor said, addressing that wretch in a 
final-judgment tone of voice, "you will go back into exile. If you break it again, the 
punishment will indeed be death. Prince Suguru's intervention is all that has saved you this 
time. It will not save you a second time. Heed this well." The Emperor turned again to his 
chancellor. "Have him placed under house arrest for tonight. Tomorrow a party must be got up 
to escort him back to Kyushu. Make sure they are careful of the Directions --"</p><p>"You 
forget who I am," said Fujiwara no Yukinaga darkly.</p><p>There was another one of those 
silences, but this one seemed to have flame licking at its edges.</p><p>The Emperor steeled 
himself. He was defying the man who had essentially ruled him since he was five years old. 
He tried to speak with the quiet confidence he had often heard in Prince Suguru's voice. "I 
have not forgot, my Lord Chancellor, who you are. I have remembered who <i>I</i> am: 
Rokutoru, Emperor of Nihon by right of descent from Amaterasu. Does your power derive from 
mine, Lord Chancellor, or mine from yours?"</p><p>Fujiwara no Yukinaga simply looked at the 
Emperor. He had gone strangely calm. "You put it in the form of a question, your most 
exalted Imperial Majesty? Well, perhaps you shall receive an answer quite soon. I am sure I 
shall study to please you in all ways. In the meantime, you may rely upon me to look to his 
Lordship's travel arrangements, and we shall be most careful of the Directions. The last 
thing we want is for his Lordship to run into any unmanageable amount of ill 
fortune."</p><p>"Well... well, that's <i>splendid</i>, my Lord Chancellor," the Emperor 
said, feeling much relieved. "I felt sure I could count on you."</p><p>"I will leave you 
with these stout guardsmen, and go and fetch some more to escort Tsujimoto-san to his 
quarters," said Fujiwara no Yukigana with great unctuousness, and slid out of the 
room.</p><p>The Emperor puffed out a breath. "You may both rise," he added.</p><p>They did. 
Prince Suguru looked solemn. Tsujimoto no Fujito looked furious.</p><p>"All, all to do 
again!" Tsujimoto burst out, exasperated. "A whole year of living rough, depending on the 
dregs of the City for my support, a life empty of even the most basic comforts, trying to 
dig my way back into my rightful place with my fingernails, and at the last minute... I 
could <i>strangle</i> you, Suguru!"</p><p>The Emperor's mouth dropped open.</p><p>Prince 
Suguru said nothing. He was looking at the doorway the Lord Chancellor had disappeared 
through. He seemed pensive.</p><p>"Well?" Tsujimoto no Fujito snapped. "What have you to say 
for yourself?"</p><p>"My failure is terrible," said Prince Suguru absently. "The weight of 
it shall hang on my heart forever."</p><p>"Tsujimoto-san!" The Emperor was outraged. "How 
can you speak to Prince Suguru so? When I told you his intervention had saved your life, was 
I not clear enough?"</p><p>Truthfully, the Emperor was put out for more than his spoken 
reasons. He had certainly not stood up to his frightening Uncle Lord Chancellor for the 
first time in his life just for the sake of doing this Tsujimoto animal a favor. And he 
wondered why the particular person he had been hoping to impress was just standing quietly, 
staring at the door.</p><p>"Prince Suguru --" he began.</p><p>Suguru turned his gaze to the 
Emperor then, and the Emperor fell silent. People seldom looked directly at him -- bad 
manners with an ordinary person, possible social suicide with an Emperor -- but Suguru was 
different.</p><p>"Your Majesty," Suguru said, "I am grateful to you for your verdict. I am 
all unworthy. I only pray you have truly struck your opponent and not hit yourself by 
mistake."</p><p>This was balm and bitterness rolled into one. "It <i>is</i> time I began to 
take the reins," the Emperor said. "I was discussing the subject with Koko-sensei only the 
other day."</p><p>"What are you so miserable about, Suguru?" said Tsujimoto no Fujito 
disgustedly, slapping the back of Prince Suguru's head lightly -- a liberty which nearly 
caused the top of the Emperor's head to come off. "I'm the one who's got to go walkabout all 
the way back to bloody Kyushu."</p><p>"Aniki," Suguru said, with enormous patience, "I will 
be clean astonied if you make it as far as Kyushu. Just now, in fact, the chances of your 
living to see the sun rise are something indeterminate."</p><p>"Wh-what do you 
mean?"</p><p>The Emperor didn't know what Prince Suguru meant either, but was pleased to see 
that Tsujimoto had lost a large measure of his overbearing self-esteem.</p><p>Prince Suguru 
was looking at Tsujimoto no Fujito with a disenchantment the Emperor found chilling. "What I 
mean is that Lord Chancellor Fujiwara may have gone to fetch your escort, or your 
executioners, depending."</p><p>"Depending on what, young know-all?" Tsujimoto 
blustered.</p><p>"Depending on whether he plans to reassert his dominion right away, or to 
postpone it a while for reasons of high policy." Prince Suguru's voice sounded as if it had 
run out of patience.</p><p>The Emperor was afraid to speak, and afraid not to. "But, Prince 
Suguru, Uncle wouldn't dare --"</p><p>"Oh, he would dare much, your Majesty," Suguru said 
earnestly, though without anger. His umbrage seemed to be reserved for his aniki, but still 
the Emperor had never heard him sound so serious. "The Fujiwaras are a thing apart, and the 
Lord Chancellor is a thing apart even from most of his kin. If he does not overturn your 
decision, it will certainly not be because he <i>dares not</i>."</p><p>The Emperor didn't 
know what to say. He'd always sensed that Uncle was a dangerous person, but that danger had 
never personally stared him in the face before...</p><p>"You know him as well as I or 
better, Great Emperor of All The Lands."</p><p>"But I am Emperor, as you say..."</p><p>"But 
you are young, my Emperor, and only just come to man's estate. He has grown old in power. I 
have some small reputation in craft and matters politic, as your Majesty knows, but I should 
not care to take on Fujiwara no Yukinaga --"</p><p>"What should I do?" The strength the 
Emperor had felt flowing through him had all trickled out, and he stood cold and afraid, 
though fortunately not alone --</p><p>"Stay calm. And guard yourself for truth. I may be 
overreacting, but Fujiwara no Yukinaga is not used to being crossed. If his retribution does 
not come tonight I am sure it will be soon --"</p><p>"What are you doing to me? Why couldn't 
you have been more diplomatic? -- You <i>fool</i>, Suguru!" Tsujimoto-san seemed to have 
recovered some of his phlegm, though he was obviously upset; there were definite cracks in 
his self-assurance.</p><p>Prince Suguru turned upon Tsujimoto-san then. He was angry, 
angrier than the Emperor had ever seen him. "Fool? I <i>was</i> a fool, yes, Aniki. I was a 
fool to cooperate with you. I was a fool to trust you when you said you had a good plan. 
There is nothing left in you worth trusting. Ill-decision seems to be a mortal malady with 
you, and a contagion as well. Now for your sake, I have committed the serious crime of 
aiding and abetting a known fugitive; I have assisted in your molestation, caused the 
flight, the loss -- I hope no worse! -- of a young woman who never did me any harm that I 
know of, and in so doing, have greatly widened and deepened -- perhaps permanently -- the 
rift between me and my cousin Sachiko. Fujiwara no Yukinaga is angry with me, my cousin is 
angry with me, and what my uncle Ogasawara is going to say about all this, on his return 
from the Middle Kingdom, I can only guess. And, in the face of all this, I have further 
leaned over the precipice that lies before me, by <i>begging for your life</i>."</p><p>"What 
are you saying, Suguru?..." Tsujimoto-san seemed poleaxed.</p><p>"I'm saying that, after 
this catastrophe, you will have to shift for yourself, Aniki. I have incurred enough trouble 
on your behalf, and with nothing to show for it but still more trouble."</p><p>"You think 
you can just cast me aside, as if I were nothing --"</p><p>Prince Suguru brought his hands 
together, <i>clap</i>, very loudly. Tsujimoto-san fell silent, apparently bewildered by 
Prince Suguru's behavior.</p><p>"I have stood in this chamber with you," Prince Suguru went 
on, "waiting for the return of the Lord Chancellor, which may mean both our deaths. And have 
you, my aniki, my older brother, my teacher, my friend, any real understanding of the 
situation? No. You curse everyone and everything but your own wilful foolhardiness, which 
alone is responsible for your position. And you have ignored the Emperor... the 
<i>Emperor</i>... on the two occasions he has spoken to you. The same Emperor who has just 
defied Fujiwara no Yukinaga for your sake.</p><p>"The conclusion I am irresistibly driven 
to, Aniki, is that I am talking to a man who is too stupid to live.</p><p>"Can you make an 
objective assessment of your recent actions, and offer me any <i>rational</i> contradiction 
of my conclusion? Bluster and footless counter-accusations don't count."</p><p>Tsujimoto no 
Fujito was silent. He seemed to have turned in on himself. He was pale, and trembling 
slightly. Beads of sweat on his forehead glistered in the torchlight.</p><p>Three more 
guardsmen came in, these in "search-and-seizure" mode. They surrounded Tsujimoto no Fujito, 
two of them taking his arms, and took him out of the room. As he went out he started and 
stopped a great many sentences -- most of them did not sound promising -- and cast many a 
pleading look at Prince Suguru, who stood like a stone.</p><p>The Lord Chancellor came in as 
they went out. "Well, well," he said. "I apologise for my outburst a few minutes ago, your 
Majesty. Your mercifulness was praiseworthy; I could only wish you possessed of a rock-hard 
practicality in addition to't. Prince Suguru, you get off clean this time, you lucky young 
rogue, because his Majesty is merciful." He chuckled. "But be more careful in future, 
eh?"</p><p>"You are quite right, my Lord Chancellor," Prince Suguru said agreeably. "My 
error was a necessary one, but I do recognise it as an error. Had His Imperial Majesty 
decided against me, I would have no grounds for complaint. And, if this sets your mind at 
rest, I consider any obligation I had to my aniki quite discharged, and I cannot think, 
offhand, of anyone else on whose behalf I would be so foolish and improvident as to defy the 
laws of the land."</p><p>Fujiwara no Yukinaga laughed heartily -- a social laugh, but it 
sounded genuine enough. "I will hold you to that, Prince Suguru."</p><p>They parted, with 
many protestations of good will.</p><p>The Emperor, for his part, walked back to his 
personal residence. His uncle had seemed much pleasanter after returning from fetching 
Tsujimoto-san's escort. Ordinarily, he would have assumed that all was smoothed over, and 
Uncle had decided to be forgiving. But Prince Suguru's words stayed in his head. Prince 
Suguru was a most sagacious man -- he most often spoke in a light, casual voice, the voice 
of a man who might at any moment float away like a dandelion-clock, but his feet were firmly 
planted on the ground. Rokutoru had often gone to him for advice, because he'd begun to be 
suspicious, and perhaps fearful, of Uncle's advice. Prince Suguru, because of his family 
background, and his position as Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Commerce, had in his head a 
good deal of information about the workings of the Government.</p><p>"Most of it, I've had 
to glean where and how I could," he had sighed, during their first conversation on the 
subject two years earlier. "In fact, the Director, Koyei-sama, regards the job as a 
sinecure, and spends most of his time socializing and making trips to Mt. Hiei, so that I 
am, de facto, Acting Chief, and the day-to-day business of running the Bureau is in my 
hands. But I had not been there one month before I found that, even with a tolerably 
complete picture in my head of its workings, who was doing what, and so on, there was a 
great deal of business being done about which I had cause to know from overhearing 
conversations among my father, my uncle Ogasawara, and Fujiwara no Ryuusuke, and which was 
not being so much as <i>monitored</i> by anyone at the Bureau."</p><p>"Really?" Rokutoru 
hated to remember himself as he'd been then. Such a child. Clumsy. Uncouth.</p><p>But Prince 
Suguru had, then and always, paid him the great compliment of taking him seriously. "Truly, 
Your Imperial Majesty. In fact, most of our time is spent on ceremony. Oh, and parties. We 
drink quite a bit of wine, at the Bureau. And exchange poems. Some of the fellows have a 
remarkable grasp of the <i>tanka</i>, and also of various Chinese forms of --"</p><p>"But... 
the business?"</p><p>"Precisely, your majesty. We do some real work, in fact. I would say 
that perhaps a tenth part of all the business I know about through my outside connections 
does pass under my hands at the Bureau. But no more. If we are not monitoring and 
promulgating commerce, who is? There's quite a bit of money being made, as I have good cause 
to know. And mine certainly isn't the only wealthy family in the Capital. The <i>eiga</i> 
seems to spiral us towards divinity at times, but in fact it is earthly, and must be paid 
for. Rice tithes from family estates account for much of it. But not all."</p><p>"Can you 
not get this under control, Prince Suguru?"</p><p>"I don't know. Yet." Prince Suguru had 
smiled then. "You may be sure, your Imperial Majesty, that I will tell you as soon as I do 
know."</p><p>Sighing and shaking his head a little as he entered his chambers from the 
garden door, the Emperor was accosted by three of his four ladies-in-waiting, and by his 
dog. There was much earnest entreaty and barking going on, and his mind had difficulty 
switching gears. "Hold on, hold on!" he cried. "Give a fellow a chance to catch his 
breath!"</p><p>"But, your Majesty!" Kaoru said, shrieking to make herself heard over the 
others, "Naga can stand on his head!"</p><p>"What? You're <i>joking</i>!" The Emperor knelt 
to face his dog. "They're <i>joking</i>, aren't they, Naga?"</p><p>"Ruf!" said Naga, wagging 
his tail in his enthusiastic way that made his whole back end jump around.</p><p>"Not a 
joke," said old Shikibu, his fourth lady-in-waiting, from her cushion in the far corner. 
"They've been making him do it, over and over, for about an hour altogether." She sipped at 
a cup she was holding. "And right entertaining it's been, too."</p><p>The three girls 
grabbed him anew, Taka at his left arm, Mika at his right, and Kaoru at the front of his 
robes. "You'll <i>see</i>!" Kaoru squealed. "My word upon it!"</p><p>"You'll be amazed, your 
Majesty!" said Taka.</p><p>"The Greatest Wonder of the World!" said Mika.</p><p>As it turned 
out, Naga could about <i>halfway</i> stand on his head, the head and the forepaws being 
well-braced, but for the rest of him, no balance; he could never stay upright for very long 
before his hind legs were kicking for purchase in thin air, and then the whole of him was 
flopping down. This part of the exercise was the cause of much merriment. But Naga garnered 
much praise nevertheless, for, as Mika pointed out, though he did not stand on his head very 
<i>well</i>, no one could recall hearing of any dog standing on his head <i>at all</i>, and 
it was therefore the most astonishing feat, deserving the widest possible 
fame.</p><p>Shikibu coughed a bit, and spat into her empty cup.</p><p>--</p><p>"<i>Very</i> 
interesting," Satou-san said. She was smiling in a way that made Shinji a bit 
uncomfortable.</p><p>"I thought it uncanny at the time," Shinji said. "It seems to mean 
something to you, though. May I ask?..."</p><p>"Oh, it just fits so well with my own 
observations," Satou-san said happily. "I'm not used to being right so many times in one 
day... Grains of sand dancing around her <i>feet</i>? And you didn't run screaming like a 
banshee?"</p><p><i>Banshee?</i> Shinji shook his head. "Well, I might have done, but the 
light wasn't good, and I grabbed for Aniki's shoulder, but he'd wandered to the other end of 
the porch, and when I looked again, I didn't see anything. I suppose I preferred to think 
I'd been imagining it, but looking back, I don't think I was. You think -- you think the 
girl's not human, then?"</p><p>"Oh, Yumi's human," Satou-san averred. "Yes, she is. Very 
intensely human, our Yumi. But she's very intensely something else as well."</p><p>"What, 
then?" Todo-san wondered.</p><p>"I don't exactly know, although I suspect," Satou-san said. 
"But this is only an indication, and there's a lot we don't know yet, and I don't want to 
jump to any conclusions -- unless the conclusion I'm standing on is on fire, in course. But 
there <i>is</i> one I might consult."</p><p>She stood, suddenly, and went 
outside.</p><p>Shinji was shocked, but only for a moment. He already knew that Satou-san was 
unconventional.</p><p>"She doesn't mean to be rude," Todo-san said quickly. "Sei -- I mean, 
Mistress -- isn't from around here --"</p><p>"I guessed," Shinji said, trying to reassure 
her. He did not want Todo-san to ever be the least bit uneasy on his behalf; just the idea 
of it seemed like impertinence on <i>his</i> part.</p><p>"Her ways are not ours." She stood. 
"I'm going to follow her. I beg your pardon, and both Mistress and I are grateful to you for 
wine and good talk --"</p><p>"But -- may I not come --" Shinji was upset.</p><p>"Follow into 
the street, if you like, Shinji-san," Todo-san said, puzzled. "It is <i>your</i> street. But 
it would be wisest not to follow further. I don't know just what Mistress is thinking about, 
but I have the feeling it's dangerous..."</p><p>Shinji rose too. They went to the 
door.</p><p>Satou-san was sitting there, in the dust of the street. She seemed to be staring 
at the house across the way, but as they came around her left side, it became obvious that 
she wasn't actually looking at it, or at anything visible to either of them.</p><p>"Is she 
--" Shinji began.</p><p>Todo-san raised a hand, and Shinji fell instantly quiet.</p><p>Time 
passed. It was hard to say how much. The west was blazing with the sun's farewell. The 
street, still deserted until Shinji got around to sending his neighbours the all-clear, was 
an unnatural oasis of quiet in the distant noise of the eternal City. It began to rain, but 
the sun was still visible. Shinji looked hopefully for a rainbow, and couldn't see one, but 
the effect of the setting sun burning behind sheets of rain was striking.</p><p>The 
sorceresses seemed not to notice the rain. Satou-san didn't move, and he thought of offering 
Todo-san his old oilcloth, but she was just looking at Satou-san, her hands clasped at her 
waist, not moving. Waiting.</p><p>Then, from under the porch of the house Satou-san wasn't 
really staring at, a cat stepped out.</p><p>And it became clear that the cat was what 
Satou-san was staring at, and had been staring at all along, even when the cat hadn't been 
there.</p><p>The cat was a grey tabby with a slight limp in its right hind leg, and a 
pleasantly jaunty step in spite of that. The corner of its right ear was missing. It 
strolled right up to Satou-san, making a casually inquisitive chirping noise -- 
<i>prrrt?</i></p><p>Satou-san took her hand out of her cloak, and held it out to the cat. 
Shinji couldn't see what was in her hand, but whatever it was, it seemed to please the cat, 
who buried its face in the hand.</p><p>Then the cat crawled into Satou-san's lap.</p><p>A 
little more time passed. The east darkened, the west deepened towards red.</p><p>The cat 
leapt out of Satou-san's lap, twirled, crouched a bit in the dust, and was gone. It seemed, 
from where Shinji stood, to have gone behind Satou-san, and not come out 
again.</p><p>Satou-san stood abruptly. She turned to them. She had an intent, serious look, 
which surprised Shinji.</p><p>"Shimako, do you feel up to a 
transformation?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I need you to fly. Fly, and find Youko. Fly, and find 
Rei. Fly, and find Eriko. We all need to bear south. Yumi is on Ninth Street, not far from 
the Rasho Mon, and she is in terrible danger. A demon. All of our powers. Do you hear? Fast, 
Shimako. Fast!"</p><p>Todo-san nodded eagerly, her cheeks flushing, and it struck Shinji 
that she was even more beautiful than he'd thought. Then she dissolved suddenly and 
sickeningly into white feathers and nothingness... and a series of low, mournful cries 
fading up the street.</p><p>"Must dash, Shinji-san," Satou-san smiled, patting Shinji's 
shoulder. "Have to see a demon about a girl." And she too had departed, in a swirl of 
flapping black leather and more than a suggestion of raven's feathers in 
disarray.</p><p>Shinji stood in the dust, alone. Cats. Demons. Feathers. Madness. They were 
not evil, as he'd heard, but they reckoned with forces beyond his ken. Two giants had passed 
by, in pursuit of a fugitive volcano, and had healed his aniki in passing, as an 
afterthought.</p><p>He shook his head. It was beyond him, and would remain so. He started to 
run west, splashing through puddles as he went, relishing the wind on his face. It had been 
a dry and dusty few days, tending his aniki. He would go to the leatherworker at the end of 
the street and pass the word that it was safe for his neighbors to come home. <i>Then I've 
got to get home myself, and quickly, in case Ichiki-sama wakes up 
hungry...</i></p><p>--</p><p>Yumi wept as she passed the entrance gate to the temple baths. 
She had been so happy, leaving there with Sachiko-sama only the other morning. They had 
walked along this very street -- on the very part she was running along now, fleeing her 
death. She forced the tears back. She couldn't cry. <i>You can't run and cry at the same 
time. If you cry, you die...</i></p><p>She longed to turn south. But the City wall was in 
the way. She could get over it, but resisting the local flow of energy was not the path to 
survival, and as she remembered the southern wall, there were houses, and farms, and too 
good a chance she'd bring destruction on others --</p><p>The enraged howls of the Demon 
behind her became suddenly louder. Without looking back, she knew that it had come around 
the corner of Sai Avenue and onto Ninth Street, behind her. And, as she had passed the 
corner of Nishiomiya only a few moments ago, she knew it had cut her lead considerably. She 
longed to remember, again, with her feet, sail straight to the Rasho Mon, but it was costly 
in energy, and who knew how much further there was to go?...</p><p>The quality, the 
direction of the sound <i>changed</i>, all at once, and was coming closer much, much too 
quickly.</p><p>She looked behind her as she ran. Ninth Street stretched away behind her 
towards the burning dying sun, which as she turned was eclipsed, as if by a small rogue 
planet moving up from the earth. Yumi was caught in the long demon-shadow preceding its 
owner up the street. Shadow grounded, Demon airborne, and flying toward her much faster than 
she could run.</p><p>In her terror she had covered most of the block, but now she stopped. 
<i>When something is coming toward you that fast, running is a waste of energy. A 
last-moment dash for cover might be efficacious, but if you're running straight away from it 
in a line, and it's chasing faster than you're running, you present no challenge at 
all...</i></p><p>...Someone had taught her that, once. There was even a voice to go with the 
words, a cracked, kindly, sometimes wandering voice. But the voice had no name...</p><p>Yumi 
stood there, weeping, trembling, in completely unfeigned despair, the Rasho Mon at her back, 
about a cho's distance off, the howling triumphant Demon sailing low over the street toward 
her front. It had dropped its borrowed Sachiko-sama shape and was now itself -- or at least, 
Yumi couldn't imagine anyone <i>wanting</i> to look this way. Long legs, elbowed like a 
chicken's, with webbed, scaly feet more like a big lizard's feet; big claws and long, thin, 
floppy toes. Body shaped like a pear stem-end down, with massive shoulders. Arms half as 
long as the legs, but still much too long, and with even worse claws at the end of them. A 
horrible, horrible head almost as wide as its shoulders, big face, wide nose, almond-shaped 
yellow eyes. A few whiskers on its chin, looking shockingly human in all that mess. Wings, 
great wide wings opened from its back. Horrible dark pink feathers like serrated 
blades.</p><p>Her death, Sachiko-sama's death, coming closer, almost here...</p><p>And, at 
the last possible moment, as the wide fanged mouth gaped and the great claws stretched for 
her, her feet <i>remembered</i>, and spun her up and away from earth and air...</p><p><i>Too 
friendly, all of them. Ghosts who lived in this night-time world were pleading with her to 
stay. Some of them, the ghosts of old gods who had had their day and faded, were especially 
importunate. One kept saying,</i> live in my garden, live in my garden<i>, wrapping its arms 
all around her gently, lovingly -- she tore free --</i></p><p>She was back, in the air, in 
the rain, and thudding down, limbs splayed out, in the fresh, glorious mud of Ninth Street. 
She was breathing deeply, harshly, swallowing rainwater clumsily. She started; she was still 
in danger -- what was that crashing? Didn't sound like thunder --</p><p>She looked behind 
her. The Rasho Mon, already in a ruinous state, had taken a direct hit from the speeding, 
overshooting Demon, and had collapsed on top of it. What timbers remained unbroken now 
creaked and cracked, split, burst like bombs as something struggled within the great heaving 
dark heap. Chips and splinters fell in a whizzing, stinging, uneven rain along with Heaven's 
blessing.</p><p>But from the sound of the infuriated shrieks and curses coming from under 
the broken, dull red roof, the Demon was not badly injured, was even angrier than before, 
and would soon be free.</p><p>Yumi's tears mingled with the rain. She was exhausted. Could 
her feet remember again today? She wasn't sure she had the energy; another like that last 
might kill her. But she might be forced to try it. She could no longer escape through the 
Rasho Mon. The city wall was ill-kept in parts, but --</p><p>Nothing else for it. She turned 
and ran north, up Red Bird Avenue. The great willows, beaten by the wind and the rain, moved 
almost like animals, tumbling about on their trunks. She could see people running; the ones 
who hadn't already been driven indoors by the rain seemed to have seen what had hit the 
Rasho Mon and were now scrambling desperately for cover.</p><p>She was doomed, she realized. 
Well, she'd <i>been</i> doomed. But she couldn't hide in or between buildings, for that 
would endanger others. And running down the middle of the great central avenue of the City, 
she presented too easy a target. And she was tired. The best she could manage was a 
shambling lope. Terror, despair, frustration. <i>If I could only have a little nap -- just 
half an hour --</i></p><p>There was a triumphant roar behind her, and a crashing noise which 
was doubtless the roof of the Rasho Mon falling away, giving up the struggle at 
last.</p><p><i>It'll catch me in about a minute.</i></p><p>There was nothing else for it. 
Her feet remembered, and left the ground --</p><p>--</p><p>Lord Oe, Bureau-Chief of the 
Board of Divination, was riding his ox-cart home in the fading light and, as it turned out, 
the sudden rain. <i>Typical bloody weather</i>, he thought, mostly safe under his canopy 
apart from the occasional random splattering and a small leak directly over his headdress, 
which he had removed, letting his hair get wet, rather than risk spoiling the lacquer. His 
lady wife was in the compartment at the back of the carriage, safe from prying eyes, and 
endeavouring to compose a poem to express the wonder of all that her eyes had beheld this 
day in the Dairi. Otherwise he might shout out at her, as it was like him, "Typical bloody 
weather, eh? I suppose we should be thankful it isn't a typhoon or a wildfire. D'you want a 
quince?" But she was already miffed at him, who knew why, she probably didn't know herself, 
seemed like ever since their wedding night she'd been miffed at him for something. It was 
probably something to do with one of his mistresses, or their daughter. Except that they 
didn't have a daughter, and they would, by Heaven, continue to not have a daughter until the 
damned girl came to her senses and not before. The very idea of it, joining the... How was 
he supposed to get her married to some deserving young fellow, specifically Yamada-kun, if 
she was going to go and do a thing like that?</p><p>Talking of the bloody -- thingummy -- 
there was one of them right now. Unnatural, a girl in boys' robes and hakama, and no 
headdress to complete the picture either, just with her hair tied up. Curling everywhere 
like little dripping wet tornadoes. But the <i>main</i> thing about this -- whatsit -- was, 
that she was blocking his way. His driver, without having been asked, was slowing the oxen 
down, from their standard, ambling, slightly-faster-than-melting-snow canter to a trembling, 
almost-not-moving-at-all-but-still-fast-enough-to-trip-over-their-own-feet-if-they-weren't-careful 
walk. Oxen are not particularly careful animals.</p><p>"Damn it all, young... thing, what do 
you mean by it?" Oe-dono roared. If the slip of a girl was going to dress like a man, then, 
damn it, she could get yelled at like a man.</p><p>Disconcertingly, the young... trout... 
smiled at him. Sort of a cheeky, knowing smile.</p><p>"Good evening, my lord," she said, 
nodding to him. "What a nice ox-cart. Be so good as to hold it here just for a moment. There 
is a rather delicate experiment going on just now. Your ox-cart might be the weight that 
drags us all down to perdition."</p><p>Oe-dono drew himself up. The saucy young... shit. He 
would give her a piece of his --</p><p>He heard, through the rain, some distance off, a 
girl's voice. The voice said, "Good evening, my lord. What a nice palanquin. Be so good as 
to hold it here for just a moment. There is a rather delicate experiment going on just now. 
Your lovely palanquin might bollocks up the whole works beyond repair."</p><p>There were a 
number of things that disturbed him about this. The cadences of this speech he was 
overhearing through the rain, at a distance, were so exactly like those in the speech this 
grinning freak had just given him. In fact... well, what with the rain and the distance he 
couldn't swear to't, of course, but it had even sounded as if...</p><p>When he heard, from a 
totally different direction, "Good evening, my lady. What a nice little cabriolet. I'm 
asking your driver to hold it here for just a moment --"</p><p>He glared at the grinning -- 
SORCERESS -- in front of him, and noticed something rather odd and unpleasant about 
her:</p><p>Her eyes were missing.</p><p>Obscenely, she batted her eyelashes at him, and 
smiled wider. "We've come from Hell to pick you up, Oe-chan."</p><p>An unnatural purple 
light filled Sai Avenue ahead. All the houses seemed to his suddenly overactive imagination 
to be made of bones.</p><p>Oe-dono screamed.</p><p>He urged his driver to turn the ox-cart 
around. He did this in a voice he himself did not recognize, and in a language he'd never 
heard before. The driver appeared to be squealing panicked curses in a completely different 
unknown language, but he <i>was</i> turning the cart around, so that was something. The 
oxen, for their part, had as their total lexicon of terror a chorus of long drawn-out mooing 
moans, with a bit of a shriek in the upper registers, and they were moving faster than 
Oe-dono had ever seen them move, which was deeply satisfying on some level where he wasn't 
absolutely insane with terror.</p><p>But soon they were clattering down the street, away 
from terror -- and away from home into the bargain, but let it pass, let it 
pass...</p><p>One full bo north, at the junction of Sai Avenue with Second Street, the real 
Touko opened her eyes and stood up from the bench she'd been sitting on, outside 
Sugawara-dono's mansion and grounds, which was more like a military compound than a house. 
The bench was a nice little hospitable touch completely out of keeping with the rest of the 
concept. Probably an innovation of the previous owner's.</p><p>That was a delicious magic 
Youko-sama had given her, the doppelgangers... Of course, Touko had improvised a 
bit...</p><p>The ghastly purple light in the street folded its whole length of perhaps two 
miles, folded it again, knotted itself furiously, intensified so that it could scarce be 
looked at, and became Touko's new mistress, standing some distance away.</p><p>Youko-sama 
immediately began walking toward Touko. She was one of those annoying people who seemed to 
like being rained on; her eyes were sparkling, and her hair, though dripping, was 
irritatingly resilient. "She doesn't show. Not so much as a bump the whole way. Nishiomiya 
Avenue next. Stops short of the Enclosure, so it's not so long. What was all the 
commotion?"</p><p>"Commotion, Mistress?" Touko said airily.</p><p>"Clacking and clattering 
and clanging. Carts and carriages all tearing away east --" Youko-sama stopped quite 
suddenly and gave Touko a stare.</p><p>"Mistress! Please don't stare so. You'd frighten 
anybody into fits. I won't be able to eat my dinner..." Touko trailed off. The stare wasn't 
becoming any friendlier.</p><p>"Just what have you been telling people?"</p><p>Touko was 
about to throw herself on Mistress's mercy -- chancy; she didn't even know whether Mistress 
had any -- when she was saved by a massive pair of white wings.</p><p>A giant white owl was 
perched on one of the lower branches of the great ginkgo to the left of Sugawara-dono's 
gate. That is, it was a giant white owl from its claws and the tips of its folded wings 
right up to its neck and then, without so much as a by-your-leave, it was Todo Shimako. Her 
golden hair spilled down over white feathers.</p><p>"How nice to see you, Shimako-chan!" 
Youko smiled.</p><p>"Thank you, Youko-sama," Shimako said sweetly but swiftly. "My Mistress 
has found Yumi-san. At the south end of the city, she says, near the Rasho Mon. Yumi-san is 
apparently being pursued by a demon."</p><p>"A <i>demon</i>?! In Heian Kyo?"</p><p>"So my 
Mistress says," Shimako said. "She says that Yumi-san is going to need all of us to make 
rescue. All of our powers."</p><p>Touko bit her nails. She enjoyed playing the terrifying 
apparition to tease self-important noblemen, but the thought of facing a real demon in 
combat sobered her quickly enough. And so she was tremendously relieved when Youko-sama 
said, "Touko, take your fingers out of your mouth. Third floor, north end of the Guild 
offices, just as fast as you can hop. Fujiwara-dono must be informed of this outrage 
immediately. Tell her I'm on my way down there right now."</p><p>"At once, Mistress," Touko 
said, and she hopped.</p><p>Above and behind her as she sped away south, great wings beat 
back the coming night...</p><p>--</p><p>High over Heian Kyo, a cloud of ravens flew 
agitatedly. At its center, an improbable figure hung, a long lanky figure in outlandish 
clothes, soaked through and heavy, but hanging on to the birds somehow, fingers 
outstretched, not touching actual birds, but seeming to fly in their atmosphere, 
almost.</p><p>They didn't like flying in storms, as Sei well knew, and they didn't like 
being dragged suddenly from nesting in a warm spot. Sei understood and appreciated their 
reluctance to serve her selfish needs, and intended to let them go as soon as possible, only 
this was a rather impractical altitude at which to do so.</p><p><i>Further south, further 
south, mates... It must shine forth ere long... Whopping great demon, don't see how we can 
miss it, even at this height --</i></p><p>There was a horrible, horrible noise, a boom and a 
low crackle, like a building collapsing from a giant's fist hitting it. Sei, her heart in 
her mouth, scanned the prospect for unusual -- <i>ah. It appears that a building has 
collapsed, well done. And not just any building!... Mother Mary...</i></p><p>The Rasho Mon. 
It had been rebuilt numerous times over the centuries, and this latest version hadn't been 
in good shape for some years by all accounts, but from the look of it something had hit it 
hard -- <i>closer --</i></p><p>She was treated to the remarkable sight of the huge, 
ponderous wreckage of the Rasho Mon shifting and bouncing around as if an ill-tempered, 
extremely large cat were trapped under it. And she heard shrieks, horribly loud, as if from 
an unnaturally large throat.</p><p>"Located: one demon, fresh and ready for roasting," Sei 
growled, and urged the birds to angle down. They did so, protesting this treatment in no 
uncertain terms, <i>caw, yark, skreeeeek.</i> "Yes, yes," Sei muttered, "I know, you're 
unhappy. Look at it this way: your troubles will be ended in but a moment, and mine will 
just be beginning, ha ha ha -- slow up a bit --"</p><p>She'd spotted Yumi. A nice trick at 
this distance, when people were still about the size of crickets, but Sei was pretty sure it 
was her. She was running away from the Rasho Mon, pelting north. She seemed to be leg-weary; 
Sei could see the shifting set of her shoulders and wagging of her head as she urged herself 
on --</p><p>There was a ghastly rending noise and a joyous rebel yell from that too-large 
throat, and Sei looked at the Rasho Mon.</p><p>The cracked roof and a few beams had fallen 
aside, revealing an unlikely horror standing up in the burning light from the west: a large 
and ungainly set of body parts taken from various giant animals and slapped together by some 
nitwit, ill-supplied Creator, in a forlorn stab at harmony, missing it by a mile, but 
hitting something else with a sickening splat. It was easily three times the height of a 
regular person -- <i>more speed, my lovelies, all the pagan gods and Satou Sei cry to ye 
now</i> -- when standing erect, but at the moment it was hastily trying to clamber its way 
out of the wreckage -- <i>how'd it hit the thing in the first place? Did Yumi fake it out 
somehow?</i> -- and looking around for its prey. Sei looked back to where Yumi had been, 
reoriented to where Yumi had managed to run to in the time, somewhat over a cho 
--</p><p>Just in time to see Yumi rise from the ground a short distance, and 
disappear.</p><p>"Ha-HAH!" Sei crowed. "As I thought! Nice one, my little Clevertoes 
--"</p><p>The demon let out a furious howl that echoed off the clouds -- its immense black 
brows drew down horribly over its nose -- and started north after Yumi Fleet-foot, trying to 
lumber up to full speed right away. It seemed to be able to follow her, somehow, even though 
she had disappeared.</p><p><i>Speed -- distance -- trajectory --</i></p><p><i>I have always 
wanted to do this.</i></p><p><i>The curse of it is, nobody's watching me.</i></p><p>With 
that sad thought, Sei let the birds go. And she plummetted through the rain, towards the 
demon, or hopefully where the demon would be -- oh, the thing about falling was, you did it 
faster and faster as you went on, and it was dashed hard to change course 
--</p><p><i>Calculations -- SUCCESSFUL --</i></p><p>She hit the demon right on top of its 
ugly head.</p><p>It went down in the muddy street with a tremendous slapping noise, 
chin-first. With a little concentration, Sei had managed to collect most of the force that 
would otherwise have broken both her legs and throw it down through her bootsoles instead, 
adding to the force of her blow. It still hurt, though. She rolled clear through the mud. 
She stung all over.</p><p>No sooner had she got to her feet than she was knocked back down. 
She instinctively rolled away from the direction of the blow, three times fast, and was up 
in a crouch. The demon had got up and was running north again. But Sei consoled herself with 
the delightfully nauseating sight of a big crack in the top of the demon's head, through 
which its purple brains could be seen to bubble gently, as well as ripple under the assault 
of the rain. And its left foot was coming down oddly, splaying inward.</p><p>Sei was on her 
feet and running after, to see if she'd slowed it enough so she could catch up to it. If 
not, why, she'd try something else...</p><p>--</p><p>Youko had chosen to fly, and the form 
of a falcon seemed to have chosen her rather than the other way around, not that she was 
fussing about these minor details right now. She went up, up, up, a terrible eagerness 
making her breast sing. She had a chance to prove herself to Fujiwara-dono, and she meant to 
make the most of it. She was also worried about Sei, who was probably already at the scene. 
Sei would be eager to challenge the thing rather than to prove herself -- she seemed to have 
got past the point of wanting to prove herself to anybody years earlier, which both 
impressed and annoyed Youko -- but she might do something reckless; she worried Youko often 
in combat, with her wildness... Once Youko was high enough, she cast out her eye into the 
winds. She had to see far... South, south... to the other end of the City...</p><p>She saw 
the demon -- a nasty piece of patch-and-stitch, part chicken, part lizard, and entirely 
horrible -- running away from the shattered ruin of the Rasho Mon. She looked around for Sei 
-- nowhere visible. As a result of a rather grievous shared experience some years earlier, 
she maintained a tenuous mental bond with Sei -- it could be strengthened with practice, but 
as it was it seemed to be about as strong as Sei was comfortable with. Youko didn't want to 
make Sei uneasy, and just having this much connection with her was nice. One of the nice 
things about it was that it made Sei easier to find in situations like this -- she cast out 
her feelings, dredging the landscape for her unruly friend --</p><p>-- in the air -- there, 
above the demon -- in a cloud of black birds --</p><p>And then Sei let go.</p><p>"SEEIII!" 
Youko was perhaps the first falcon ever to make this particular cry. She was very upset. She 
was flying as fast as she could, but of course there was no way she could possibly get there 
in time, Sei had just jumped, this was all a great distance away, however close it looked in 
her mind. All she could do was watch as Sei shot earthward through the rain, and hit the 
demon on the top of the head. Then she thought Sei was dead, until Sei rose from the mud. 
Then she thought Sei was dead again after the demon, seemingly accidentally, brushed her 
with one arm as it was getting up to continue its run northward. But then Sei got up again 
and ran after the demon.</p><p>Well, it seemed to be a pretty good gamble after all, but Sei 
was still going to get a talking-to later. She had just given Youko the worst moment of her 
recent life.</p><p>Youko flew on. She was going to have to change back to human form before 
she engaged the demon, but she would wait until she was almost on top of it before she did 
that...</p><p>--</p><p>Noriko had found a food-vendor, and had purchased fish balls for 
herself and a bowl of minced chicken for Rei-pochi, which she had set down in front of her. 
Rei-pochi had eaten enthusiastically. She'd become more monosyllabic as the hunt had gone 
on. Noriko wasn't sure if this was a side-effect of the transformation, or of the general 
discouragement that had attended upon their efforts.</p><p>For the hunt had <i>not</i> been 
a success. Rei-pochi had sniffed all along the south wall of the Enclosure, and nothing. Had 
decided to check both the eastern and western walls in case Yumi-san had doubled back, and 
nothing. Ever-increasing circles had they described about that part of the Enclosure wall 
which corresponded to the area in which Yumi-san was last seen. And nothing. Rei-pochi had 
repeatedly referred to the piece of Yumi-san's linen which Noriko still held, but eventually 
said, "All I'm smelling now is my own nose," and gave that up. She hadn't said much after 
that.</p><p>They stood by the vendor on this busy stretch of Third Street, near the junction 
with Mibu Avenue. Rain began to fall. The vendor cursed merrily and hurried to pack up his 
goods. The people strolling by began to hurry by, putting their sleeves over their heads 
though there was still a tunnel through the clouds through which the setting sun boiled in 
the west behind the sheets of rain, creating a peculiar effect. The porch of the inn near 
where the vendor stood had good big eaves stretching out over the street a ways, so Noriko 
took shelter under those, finishing her meal there. Rei-pochi, who had swallowed hers almost 
at a gulp, followed Noriko, but didn't seem to care much that it was raining. She was 
sometimes under the eaves with Noriko, other times running about in the rain, even playing 
with another dog at one point. Rei-pochi seemed to have forgotten all about the hunt for 
Yumi-san, and seemed to be very much a dog, and Noriko adored the dog, but was beginning to 
worry.</p><p>She had pretty much resolved on taking Rei-pochi back to the Guild offices and 
seeing if someone could change her back to Rei-sama, when suddenly there was a dark shape 
moving in the rain above them.</p><p>There was a giant white owl perched on the eaves above 
Noriko's head. Her first instinct was to get out from under it fast before it crapped on 
her, but then she saw that it was looking at her with the face of Todo Shimako. Noriko felt 
a huge wave of relief -- she wasn't alone with her problem any more. She looked up to 
Shimako-san -- Shimako-san could cope, if anything, even better than 
Noriko.</p><p>"Shimako-san! Thank Heaven!"</p><p>"My sentiments exactly!" Shimako-san said. 
"I've been looking everywhere for you, Noriko-chan! I have to get along and find Eriko-sama 
fast, but where in the world is Rei-sama?"</p><p>Noriko pointed. Shimako-san looked and saw 
the frolicking dog, splashing through a puddle, chasing a sudden rat under a house, bumping 
her head on a support strut and falling back, dazed.</p><p>"Oh, my," Shimako-san 
breathed.</p><p>"I didn't know what to do," Noriko confided. "I was just going to take her 
along to the Guild --"</p><p>"No," Shimako-san said. "Or, ordinarily, yes, but there's 
no-one there right now. We have an emergency. There is a demon."</p><p>"Oh, no! I thought 
they couldn't come into the City!"</p><p>"Most of them can't. And the ones who can usually 
don't make trouble, because they know what Fujiwara-dono will do to them. This one seems to 
be chasing Yumi-san; we don't know why."</p><p>Shimako-san blurred then, white feathers and 
golden eyes in a shifting mass tumbled from the roof with an almost musical rustling sound, 
and she stood in her human form once again, in soaked white robes, her golden hair dark with 
rain, tumbling appealingly about her shoulders. She looked magnificent, but then she always 
did, Noriko thought.</p><p>Shimako-san went to Rei-pochi, and knelt next to her in the muddy 
street. She put an arm around Rei-pochi, who was still dizzy from hitting her 
head.</p><p>"Rei-sama, we need you," said Shimako-san.</p><p>The dog looked uncomfortable, 
or perhaps just preoccupied, and tried to pull away, making a "harf!" noise. Shimako-san 
held fast. "Rei-sama. We need you. Yumi-san is in great danger, to the south. There is a 
demon, Rei-sama."</p><p>That got the dog's attention. She swiveled her head fast to stare at 
Shimako-san, her ears flapping wetly.</p><p>"We all need you. Yoshino-san needs you most of 
all. Rei-sama, I cherish you." Shimako-san kissed the wet, doggy head. "I admire you so 
much. Noriko-chan does too."</p><p>Noriko knelt on the dog's other side, and also kissed her 
head. (She'd actually been wanting to do this since the transformation, but had been shy.) 
"Please come back to us, Rei-sama. Shimako-san is right. We need you."</p><p>The dog shook 
herself, spattering the two novices with doggy rain water. They laughed, and covered their 
faces with their hands. When they looked again, Rei-sama knelt between them, drenched, 
filthy, and quite naked.</p><p>They led her quickly over to the eaves of the house. Noriko 
produced Rei-sama's clothes, which she'd taken pretty good care of -- they'd got a 
<i>bit</i> wet, but that was hardly a consideration now. Rei-sama dressed. She couldn't seem 
to quite look at either of them -- shame? -- and she seemed still to be looking inward, at 
something that had gone wrong.</p><p>"You'll be all right?" Shimako-san said worriedly. 
"Only I really ought to go find Eriko-sama --"</p><p>"I'm fine," Rei-sama said, a little too 
loudly. Was she still barking a bit? "Really. Run along, Shimako. We'll get over onto Red 
Bird Avenue and head south, I think, Noriko-chan. Stay behind me, once we sight it. You're 
talented but you may not be up to demons yet." Rei-sama shuddered. "<i>I</i> may not be, 
depending on the demon. We'll see."</p><p>"I really should -- " Shimako-san 
started.</p><p>"Fastest," Rei-sama agreed. Then she stared. "Oh, the nine hells take it -- 
Eriko-sama and Yoshino!"</p><p>"Yes --"</p><p>"They're in the southeast, damn it! What if 
they've fallen foul of the demon already?"</p><p>Shimako-san's concerned look was replaced 
with one of horror. She blurred again, to white, to gold, to air and 
water.</p><p>"<i>Fast</i>, Noriko-chan! Flaming hells -- oh, I shouldn't transform again for 
a while, probably, but --" She was clutching at Noriko's arm and looking around 
wildly.</p><p>An Imperial messenger chose this moment to ride by. He was an excellent 
horseman, and the horse's maneuvers were executed most admirably. But the messenger's broad 
conical hat appeared to have a hole in it, and rain was trickling over his face. One eye was 
closed, and the other was doing a lot of bulging and rolling.</p><p>Rei-sama's eyes widened, 
then narrowed.</p><p>"Rei-sama, please..." Noriko said worriedly.</p><p>Rei-sama released 
Noriko's arm, and strode up to the horseman, waving her arms. "Need to borrow your horse," 
she said, without formality.</p><p>The messenger looked down at her with an incredulous 
one-eyed glare. Then he shook his head -- dribble, dribble -- and pressed on.</p><p>Rei-sama 
caught at his bridle. "There isn't time for this," she said. She was visibly struggling for 
calm, self-mastery. "The City is in danger. My friends are in danger. My Yoshino is in 
danger. I'll pay you if you need paying, but I need your horse <i>now</i>."</p><p>The man 
glared at her this time, took a truncheon from his belt, and swung it at Rei-sama's head, 
roaring, "Clear off, woman!"</p><p>Noriko closed her eyes, wincing. She heard a man's 
scream, a thump, the whinnying of a horse. When she opened them, the truncheon was bouncing 
slightly in the dust and the messenger was sprawling in a rubbish-heap in the mouth of a 
nearby alley. Rei-sama still had the horse by the bridle, now had a hand in its mane as 
well, and was up on tip-toe, whispering into its ear. Its eyes were rolling a bit, but its 
initial frenzy seemed to be dying down.</p><p>"Come on, Noriko-chan," said Rei-sama, 
mounting.</p><p>Noriko didn't care for horses overmuch, but... she walked timidly to its 
left flank. "What do I --"</p><p>"Your hand!"</p><p>Staring down from the saddle, seated 
easily, her hand out, Rei-sama had an air of command to her that brought out the obdurate in 
Noriko, but she supposed there was no more time for such things. She gave Rei-sama her hand 
--</p><p>-- and was yanked up and spun around in the air so that she landed behind Rei-sama, 
on the butt of the saddle, which just had room for the two of them if they squeezed 
up.</p><p>"Arms around me!"</p><p>"Rei-sama --"</p><p>"No time! Arms around 
me!"</p><p>Noriko obeyed.</p><p>"Now we ride," Rei-sama breathed. The anticipation in her 
voice was unmistakable.</p><p>"Rei-sama, you have no <i>spurs</i>," Noriko 
objected.</p><p>Rei-sama chuckled. "You have <i>so</i> much to learn, Noriko-chan," she said 
tolerantly. "Now hold on tight!" She leaned forward and whispered something in the horse's 
left ear.</p><p>The horse screamed, and bolted.</p><p>Noriko's screams echoed those of the 
horse, as she clasped herself desperately to this lunatic's back. The rain pelted her, the 
wind lashed at her. And somewhere, she heard Rei-sama yelling, "HYAH! HYAH!"</p><p>A swoop 
around a corner, long light willow branches slapped at their heads playfully, and they were 
out on Red Bird Avenue, pounding south in the rain.</p>
