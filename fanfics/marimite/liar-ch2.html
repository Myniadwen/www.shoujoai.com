For great justice!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We were halfway to Astrea before finally hitting our first stopping 
point. Due to some good luck we&#39;ve had to take two cars. Sei and Yumi 
were taking Sachiko and Shizuma in the beetle, the other six of us in 
Rei&#39;s van. I think that&#39;s a fitting enough punishment for what Sachiko 
has been trying to put me through.

Really I wonder how Miyuki feels about all this, or if she&#39;s as clueless 
as I was.

&quot;Are you coming?&quot; Rei asks as they all pile out of the van. Though this 
stop is mainly for Shimako and Norkio everyone is happy to show an 
interest in their hobby and get to know the quiet duo a bit better.

&quot;Ah, I&#39;d actually like to talk to Eriko for a bit in private,&quot; I say as 
I get out of the van as well. Eriko looks surprised, but not entierly 
displeased at the idea. &quot;Accompany me for a walk?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be back by the time you&#39;re ready,&quot; Eriko tells Rei who looks as 
stoic as ever. Sometimes I find it amusing how Rei has never once 
questioned the authority of Eriko. If only Sachiko had been that way. 
Though I suppose she wouldn&#39;t be a Chinensis if she wasn&#39;t stubborn.

&quot;Sorry for keeping you from the sights,&quot; I apologize as we walk away 
from the group.

&quot;You know I don&#39;t care. What&#39;s on your mind Youko?&quot;

We walk the temple grounds in silence for a moment while I put my 
thoughts together, finding my situation a bit awkward. This wasn&#39;t 
something I had anticipated confiding in Eriko about. But then, isn&#39;t 
she the only one there is?

&quot;How did you manage to be the only normal one?&quot; I ask finally.

She looks confused for a moment, but finally I see it dawns on her. She 
laughs as she sits on a bench, patting the seat next to her for me to 
sit in. &quot;Are you asking this seriously?&quot;

&quot;I am. It seems odd, does it not? We&#39;re a big group of bumbling lesbians 
and you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s somehow boy crazy.&quot;

&quot;How could I not be? Growing up with my brothers and my father doting on 
me so much. Your not still worried about it are you Youko?&quot;

&quot;No, not really. I know what my future is and I&#39;ve always accepted it. 
Sachiko&#39;s boldness has me wondering though, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Well I trust that your logical enough to not wonder too much,&quot; Eriko 
says seriously. It&#39;s exactly what I expected to hear from her.

I feel better, a bit. Of course I will not wonder too much. I will do 
what I came here to do then go back to school, finish my courses get 
married and live a perfectly meaningless life.

&quot;Shall we go join the others?&quot; I ask finally after a few minutes of 
silence, not wanting to hold her from the group for too long.

After visiting the temple we take back to the road, ready to finish our 
trip to Astrea and despite my talk with Eriko, I can&#39;t help but feel 
excited at the prospect of seeing Miyuki. Who cares if it makes me a bit 
narcissistic?

&quot;I can have a little summer fun, can&#39;t I?&quot; I ask Eriko quietly.

Her grin says it all.

----

Between worrying about graduation tomorrow and Shizuma&#39;s arrival I 
haven&#39;t had any peace today. Everything is finally as it should be and 
now I sit for tea with Tamao and Nagisa, proud of how much they have 
learned in the last month. Sometimes I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t run for 
Etoile.

&quot;Shall we make any special preparations for Shizuma-sama&#39;s return?&quot; 
Tamao asks.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think she would want us to. Ah, just, lets just try to do 
our best to keep her away from her room, in case she tries ok?&quot;

&quot;Her room?&quot; Nagisa asks. I know we should tell her, but somehow I don&#39;t 
have the heart to relieve that time in my life.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later,&quot; Tamao promises. &quot;Shizuma won&#39;t be in the dorms 
though will she? Isn&#39;t it against school rules?&quot;

I can&#39;t help my laugh.

&quot;Since when has she listened to those?&quot;

&quot;Rokujou-sempai! You have a call!&quot;

&quot;Excuse me for a moment,&quot; I say as I stand.

I take the phone from one of the underclassmen who blushes slightly upon 
finding that I remember her name. &quot;Rokujou Miyuki speaking.&quot;

&quot;So formal Miyuki,&quot; Shizuma says.

I&#39;m not quite sure but I think I can almost hear Sachiko whispering 
something along the lines of &quot;Dear God help me.&quot; in the background.

&quot;Is everything okay, Shizuma?&quot;

&quot;Of course. We&#39;re almost there. Care to meet us at the gate in about 
thirty minutes?&quot;

I agree and we get off the phone. Returning to Tamao and Nagisa I ask if 
they would like to accompany me. Nagisa is more than enthusiastic at the 
prospect of meeting the still famous Etoile. Tamao tenses up at the 
idea, no doubt remembering the flirtatious ways of Shizuma.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s with someone now,&quot; I whisper in her ear so Nagisa 
can&#39;t hear. I can&#39;t blame Tamao for her fear, Nagisa would have 
definitely been Shizuma&#39;s type once upon a time.

It only takes about ten minutes after our arrival at the gate before I 
see Shizuma and Sachiko walking towards us. I only catch sight of 
Shizuma&#39;s wild grin for a second before seeing Sei and... Youko?

&quot;Ah Shizuma,&quot; I call out finally, walking to meet her halfway for a hug.

&quot;Greeted by the council presidents, I&#39;m honored,&quot; Shizuma replies as she 
embraces Tamao much to her surprise. &quot;Tamao-chan, I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re 
taking over for Miyuki. Congratulations.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Shizuma-sama. I will do my best to be as good of a president 
as her,&quot; I hear her replying as I am surprised by a hug from Sachiko.

&quot;Hello, Miyuki,&quot; Youko finally says and I can&#39;t help but wonder if this 
is as awkward for her as it is me.

&quot;Good to see you Youko, Sei,&quot; I say as I greet both of them. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
know you were bringing anyone but Sachiko, Shizuma.&quot;

&quot;Ah that&#39;s somewhat my fault. They needed someone to drive them here and 
I thought it would be a good idea for a road trip,&quot; Sei says as she 
laughs, her hand in her hair.

&quot;Everyone else is at the hotel already. Think of it as New Year&#39;s plus 
one,&quot; Shizuma responds.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid she won&#39;t let you out of this one,&quot; Youko says.

I suppose there&#39;s no need to feel awkward if she&#39;s not going to act 
awkward. I watch Youko for a second as Shizuma is distracted by her 
introduction to Nagisa. She notices but I don&#39;t look away as she moves 
closer to me. &quot;Talk later?&quot; she asks.

I give a nod, waiting for someone to explain what&#39;s going on to me.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Shizuma asks, breaking me out of my thoughts. &quot;You&#39;re 
spending the night with us.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t! You know it&#39;s against the rules Shizuma.&quot;

Really where does she come up with these ideas?

&quot;You graduate tomorrow right? There&#39;s nothing they can do about it now,&quot; 
Sei adds.

&quot;I&#39;ll cover for you,&quot; Tamao says. &quot;Think of it as a test of what you&#39;ve 
taught me.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s settled. We did all come all this way for you,&quot; Shizuma lays it 
on thick and I know I can&#39;t win. I take another glance at Youko. What 
the hell is wrong with me for still finding her beautiful?

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll go.&quot;

----

We wait while Miyuki grabs some necessities and then pile back into 
Sei&#39;s small car. Luckily they give me the front seat so that I don&#39;t 
have to be smushed in too close to Miyuki. The ride back to the hotel 
isn&#39;t really bad, Shizuma and Miyuki&#39;s conversation keeping things from 
getting weird.

&quot;Remember to have fun,&quot; Sachiko whispers in my ear as she leans up to 
the front seat. &quot;Look how much better my life is now that I learned how 
to.&quot;

Is it really better? Not yet. But I haven&#39;t had time to speak to her 
about it. About what my present is for her graduation, assuming she is 
willing to accept it.

I glance in the mirror and see Miyuki&#39;s eyes on me as Shizuma tells her 
about the activities she&#39;s planned for them once we return to Lillian. 
She doesn&#39;t back down and look away just the same as she hadn&#39;t earlier. 
She doesn&#39;t look angry with me either. She just looks... content.

Beautifully content.

We arrive at the hotel and return to the row of rooms that have been 
rented. Apparently while we were gone they decided that each couple 
would get a room, leaving Miyuki, Eriko and I to share the last room. 
Everyone is thrilled with this idea but us though they leave us no room 
to argue.

One night. Two beds. Three people.

This wasn&#39;t the sort of summer fun I had in mind.

Eriko is whispering something to Rei, and I can&#39;t help but wonder just 
how much she has heard about our last attempt at getting together for a 
group activity. I look to Sachiko for help, for something, anything. To 
my surprise it&#39;s Sei who approaches me and pulls me aside.

&quot;We&#39;ll meet for dinner downstairs in a half hour, okay?&quot; she says to the 
group just before giving Yumi a quick kiss. &quot;C&#39;mon.&quot;

Though reluctant I follow her knowing that despite it all, Sei probably 
has the biggest heart of us all. She just likes to hide it behind joking 
and flirting. &quot;What do you need?&quot; I ask finally once we are in the 
elevator.

&quot;Just to talk. Nothing harmful. It&#39;s just that I saw the way you were 
looking at her in the car Youko.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with looking at someone? I&#39;m looking at you right now 
aren&#39;t I?&quot; I fix a cold stare on her.

&quot;But you&#39;re not looking at me the way you used to. You&#39;re looking at her 
the way you used to look at me. Damn it Youko look at us, all of us. 
Every one of us is happy but you,&quot; I can hear the desperation in her 
voice and I feel almost as if time hasn&#39;t passed at all since high 
school.

&quot;Not you too. Please Sei. You of all people know better then this. For 
one, I don&#39;t even know the girl. So she&#39;s a good kisser. So I find her 
attractive. It doesn&#39;t mean I have to pick up as if I haven&#39;t been away 
from her for six months. It was fun and now it&#39;s over.&quot;

&quot;You always were good at that Youko,&quot; she shakes her head as she says 
this in a way that has always pissed me off. &quot;Having some fun and 
deciding when it was over.&quot;

Trying my best to keep my cool I take a deep breath and steady my gaze 
on her. &quot;Sei you knew what would happen. If you wanted to make me feel 
guilty for something that happened years ago its not going to work.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not trying to make you feel guilty, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; It&#39;s sincere and I 
know she means it. Why is everyone suddenly so concerned with my life? 
&quot;Look it&#39;s just we all want you to be happy when you&#39;re with us. It&#39;s 
likely this is the last time we&#39;ll all be together, you know as well as 
I do things are about to blow up in our faces.

&quot;Yumi&#39;s parents are starting to figure things out and God only knows if 
she&#39;ll stay with me if they do. Rei and Yoshino are a scandal upon 
themselves. Sachiko is about to be married off. You&#39;ll be married soon 
and who knows if we&#39;ll ever see you...&quot;

Before she can say anymore I find myself hugging her. She returns my 
embrace and for a minute I feel like I&#39;m sixteen all over again. &quot;Would 
you really have me lead her on so that I can have a few days of play?&quot;

&quot;You never had any problems telling me like it is,&quot; she says as we break 
our embrace.

&quot;Okay, how about this? Hey Miyuki I&#39;ll never talk to you after this trip 
unless circumstances force us together again, but what do you say we 
sleep together just for fun?&quot;

&quot;You would never be so crude,&quot; she pauses as smirk settles on her face. 
&quot;Well, I suppose you would, but I&#39;m not supposed to remember that!&quot;

She starts laughing and it&#39;s infectious.

&quot;You&#39;re impossible Sei.&quot;

&quot;I know, but it&#39;s part of my charm.&quot;

I swat her away from me as we head towards the lobby to wait for 
everyone else. We talk about everything and nothing all at once and for 
the first time in a very very long time I feel close to Sei again. I 
listen as she talks about Yumi watching the way her eyes light up and 
she becomes so animated. I&#39;m glad she&#39;s found someone who can love her 
back.

&quot;Looks like someone is in a better mood,&quot; Eriko says as the group 
approaches the table Sei and I had seated ourselves at. &quot;You two ready 
for dinner?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hit it!&quot; Sei stands and embraces Yumi and I see everyone&#39;s 
smiling faces as I look around the room. Maybe I really should do 
something about being the only one with nothing to smile about.

----

Shizuma made reservations at Vue de Monde, a new French restaurant in 
town I had told her I wanted to try. She said this was their present for 
my graduation, which is already more then I could have wanted or 
expected. But who was I to argue? I&#39;ve already learned better with this 
group.

This time it was Youko and I who were chosen, by Sei herself, to ride 
with her and Yumi in the beetle. Sei claimed it was because we made the 
least amount of fuss over her driving but I had a feeling it had more to 
do with whatever it was they had spoken about. Shizuma had tried to save 
me from it but I reassured her that I didn&#39;t mind riding with Youko. She 
seems just as pleasant sober as she had been drunk the last time I saw 
her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she finally says after about fifteen minutes of driving. 
It&#39;s quiet enough so that they don&#39;t hear us up front yet Sei seems to 
find that the right moment to turn the music up as well.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be. We all have reasons for why we do or don&#39;t do 
things.&quot;

I know that better than anyone right now. It&#39;s not as if anything could 
have ever happened anyways. Nothing permanent.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; she says softly.

I look up at her and watch the way she watches me.

&quot;This is such a weird situtation, isn&#39;t it? Being attracted to you.&quot;

&quot;Who cares? We can have fun for a little while, can&#39;t we?&quot;

Did Shizuma tell her?

Youko smiles and puts her hand on mine. I suppose if a little while is 
okay with her, I&#39;m not going to argue. I lace my fingers with hers and 
smile.

Much to my dismay we arive at the restaurant a few minutes later and all 
rush in to get our table. No one seems to notice that Youko is grinning 
as she takes the seat next to me. No one notices that my breath catches 
in my throat as I feel her hand on my thigh under the table. There&#39;s 
nothing wrong with having a simple sexual attraction to someone is 
there?

Dinner is going smoothly as everyone talks about nothing in particular, 
and I can&#39;t help but notice the joy Shizuma has found with them. I&#39;m a 
bit jealous, but am not given much time to think on it as a young man 
walks over to our table.

Shit.

&quot;Miyuki! Imagine my surprise when I saw you sitting here. I couldn&#39;t 
stop myself from coming to say hi,&quot; the man says with a polite, even 
somewhat attractive smile. &quot;You hadn&#39;t told me you had so many people 
that were coming to visit. No wonder you declined my invitation for 
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Michiaki-kun, I&#39;m surprised to see you here. I hope I haven&#39;t offended 
you too terribly by refusing your dinner offer,&quot; I respond as I stand to 
greet him properly. &quot;Please join us,&quot; I add with a bow.

This isn&#39;t fair. I glance to Shizuma to save me, but what can she do? I 
can see Sachiko&#39;s eyes shine in understanding, my sudden behavior very 
familiar to her from what I have heard.

&quot;I would love to my beautiful Miyuki. But I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m out with 
business partners now, so we will have to make up for this another 
night,&quot; he says. &quot;I will see you tomorrow at your ceremony before you 
leave though, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&quot;

&quot;Then please excuse me.&quot;

He kisses my cheek and gives a faint bow to everyone at the table before 
rejoining his own table and guests. I look at everyone staring at me in 
surprise. This isn&#39;t exactly how I had planned on making friends with 
them all. I know I don&#39;t need to say it, but Youko&#39;s lips fall open as 
the unasked question lingers on them.

&quot;Well now that you&#39;ve all met my fiancee, shall we continue with 
dinner?&quot; I ask quietly, forcing the smile back onto my face.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oooh drama. I think I just keep digging my hole even deeper by 
continuing with this story, really.</pre>
