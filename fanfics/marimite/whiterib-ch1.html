~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      On White&#39;s Day, if a boy gave a girl a white ribbon and tied it in 
her hair, they would fall in love.  That was how the legend went, but 
today there would be a few changes.  What if a girl gave another girl a 
white ribbon...? 

      Sachiko really wasn&#39;t a fan of the holidays.  She didn&#39;t dislike 
them; it was more that she didn&#39;t notice them.  She definitely couldn&#39;t 
expect a white ribbon from Suguru, and she was never planning on giving 
him any chocolate for Valentine&#39;s Day.  He would probably be too busy 
passing out chocolate to every boy he knew for him to notice that 
Sachiko had bothered to give him anything. 

      Sachiko almost chuckled aloud at the thought.  Her cousin was an 
okay guy, even if he was more than a little strange.  But now wasn&#39;t the 
time to be thinking of Suguru. 

      The crystalline greenhouse soon came into view.  Yumi was here, 
Sachiko knew.  She really had become that close to her petite soeur.  Of 
course, it wasn&#39;t that strange that Yumi was here.  The greenhouse was a 
beautiful and calming place, filled with flowers like roses and lilies. 

      &quot;Yumi, where are you?&quot; Sachiko called out as she stepped into the 
greenhouse.  She looked around and then spotted her petite soeur sitting 
on the bench while staring at the clear sky through the glass ceiling. 

      Yumi turned her head.  &quot;Oh, hi!&quot; she greeted with a bright smile 
on her face.  The sunlight reflected off of the chain of her rosary.  &quot;I 
was just thinking about you.&quot; 

      Sachiko smiled softly and sat down next to Yumi.  &quot;I have a gift 
for you, Yumi,&quot; she began.  From her skirt pocket she pulled out a pair 
of white, silk ribbons. 

      &quot;They&#39;re beautiful!&quot; Yumi exclaimed.  &quot;But why two?&quot; 

      &quot;If one doubles the ribbons, will the love double?&quot; Sachiko mused.  
&quot;Besides, you always wear two ribbons in your hair.&quot; 

      Very gently, Sachiko removed the plain ribbons from Yumi&#39;s hair.  
She then began tying the beautiful white ribbons firmly around Yumi&#39;s 
pigtails.  The bond between Sachiko and Yumi was special, and no white 
ribbon could change that.  Rather, it was the strength of their feelings 
for each other that went into the knots of the two white ribbons. 

      When Sachiko was finished, Yumi&#39;s hands went up to touch the white 
ribbons in her hair.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she breathed. 

      &quot;They look lovely on you,&quot; Sachiko complimented, placing her hands 
on Yumi&#39;s. 

      Another moment passed, and their lips touched.  White ribbons 
could reveal love.</pre>
