<h1>Rainy Day Reunion</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ghost.html">Ghost</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello, everyone! This is my first fic, so be gentle, and I&#39;d love 
feedback, if anyone has the time. 


The rain pounded steadily against Satou Sei&#39;s windows. It had been 
raining all day, coating the dry ground and parched concrete with small 
droplets; the slow, monotonous kind of rain that could continue for 
days. Sei hadn&#39;t seen the sun all day, and the clouds had put her in a 
reminiscent, melancholy mood that she couldn&#39;t seem to shake, so she 
moped around her small apartment the whole day, half-heartedly reading a 
novel and trying to clean up the mess she had made all week.

She wandered around her apartment, talking to herself out loud from time 
to time (she really ought to get a cat), fiddling with the ends of her 
hair, lost deep in thought as she glanced out her window, in the 
direction of Lillian High School. 

It seemed like ages since Sei had graduated from Lillian, but little 
reminders popped up everywhere. Sei still delighted in seeing innocent, 
blushing little Yumi from time to time, although now in her third year 
she had matured into a Rosa Chinensis that Sachiko would have been proud 
of. She didn&#39;t even wear her cute little pigtails for Sei to pull on, 
they disappeared the day Sachiko had graduated from Lillian. And 
elegant, beautiful Shimako, Sei&#39;s beloved petite soeur, who was already 
being courted by many universities. Sei watched Shimako and Noriko from 
afar, happy with how the two girls became such close soeurs, happy that 
she had allowed Shimako to be her own person. She also made an effort to 
have tea with Yoshino and Rei every once in awhile, but both were so 
busy, especially since Rei went to college away from Lillian. She found 
it odd that she never saw Sachiko, even though they both attended 
Lillian University, but Sei had no doubt that family drama and frequent 
visits to see Yumi kept her preoccupied. 

She even managed to call her onee-sama a few times, who was already 
married (Sei had attended her wedding in a pants suit, much to the 
chagrin of her parents and the amusement of her onee-sama). She had 
exchanged one letter with Eriko, but hadn&#39;t seen or heard from Youko. 
Sei lounged against the counter in her small kitchen, waiting for her 
tea to finish, tapping her fingers impatiently against the again 
linoleum countertop. It was odd, even after this passed time, to not 
have Youko to meddle in her business.

A sharp knocking woke her from her reverie, and Sei jumped, almost 
knocking the small pot of tea over. Cursing softly to herself, Sei 
wandered towards the front door, unable to hide the shock on her face 
when she saw who was on the other side of it.

&quot;Youko&quot;.

The former Rosa Chinensis stood, proud and tall, taller than Sei 
remembered umbrella in hand. Sei was floored, and couldn&#39;t say anything 
else until Youko opened her mouth to politely say,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for the intrusion.&quot;

Sei&#39;s expression perked up considerably and she reached for her former 
classmate automatically. &quot;Youko! You tease, I&#39;m so glad to see you.&quot; Sei 
felt Youko tense up at the small contact of Sei&#39;s arm clutching hers, 
and Sei withdrew the hand. She&#39;d almost forgotten that Youko was never 
really physically affectionate with her, or even with Sachiko. 

&quot;Please, come in!&quot; Sei waved Youko in, closely the door quickly behind 
her. Taking a step back from each other, the friends looked each other 
up and down. Youko was in her black professional suit, Sei with her 
always-disheveled light colored hair and simple jeans-and-tee-shirt 
attire. 

&quot;You&#39;ve grown your hair out since I&#39;ve seen you last,&quot; Youko commented 
as she set her bag, umbrella, and shoes by the door.

Sei laughed. &quot;And you look oh so grown up! My, my, Youko. Look where 
your meddling got you!&quot;

Youko&#39;s lips curled in that small, mischievous smile that Sei loved so 
dearly. &quot;We&#39;re never too old for teasing, are we, Sei?&quot;

Sei smiled widely, placing a hand on her hip. &quot;That&#39;s just cause you&#39;re 
so damn tease-able, dearest Youko.&quot;

A small sound from the kitchen sent Sei yelping to save her tea. Youko 
couldn&#39;t help but chuckle a little. Sei hadn&#39;t changed. Sei never would. 
She would always be unabashedly herself, which Youko missed. &quot;Want some 
tea to warm up?&quot; Sei called from the kitchen, which Youko accepted with 
a small affirmative noise. &quot;Sit at the table, I&#39;ll bring it out.&quot;

The tea was surprisingly good, but Youko didn&#39;t let it show on her face. 
She sipped quietly while Sei rambled for a few minutes about the &#39;damn 
rain&#39; and how it would never end. Sei&#39;s expressive eyes noticed the 
serious look on Youko&#39;s face, and her expression changed to one of 
worry.

&quot;How are you, Youko?&quot;

Youko set down her cup lightly. &quot;I&#39;m doing well. I am studying law, and 
I&#39;m well on my way to getting my degree. I&#39;ve even gotten the chance to 
do a little traveling, and now I&#39;m back home for the break. Sachiko gave 
me quite a scare a little while back, thank goodness Yumi loves her so 
much. How are you, Sei?&quot;

Sei shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m okay. I still don&#39;t know what I want to study, so 
I&#39;ve been trying a little of everything to see what sticks. I really 
love art, and painting, but I suppose it&#39;s unreasonable for a career 
choice.&quot;

Youko smiled slightly. &quot;Why would that stop you?&quot;

Sei laughed lightly, took a sip of her tea. &quot;Good point. You know me so 
well, Youko. You were always able to meddle in all the right ways&quot;. 
Unexpectedly, Youko blushed and smiled. Sei smiled back and changed the 
subject.

&quot;I&#39;ve heard some nasty rumors about Eriko from Yoshino. Want to fill me 
in?&quot;

Youko returned Sei&#39;s laugh. 

&quot;I just heard about that myself, actually, but I called her last week to 
confirm it. Eriko&#39;s engaged, to a nice boy from Osaka.&quot;

Sei&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Really?&quot;

Youko nodded. &quot;Yes, indeed. I&#39;ve even met him, briefly. He is extremely 
kind, and perfect for Eriko.&quot;

Sei sat back in wonder. &quot;Wow. The first one of us. How old is she? 20?&quot;

Youko nodded. &quot;Yes, I think 20 is right. The wedding is going to be next 
fall, so be aware.&quot;

Sei clapped her hands together in delight, then gave Youko her best 
come-hither look. &quot;I think you should wear that sexy suit to the 
wedding, Youko. It&#39;s really quite tempting.&quot;

Youko felt a slight burn in her chest, but ignored it. &quot;Only if you wear 
a dress, Sei&quot;.

&quot;Aww, you&#39;re no fun.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what you have Yumi for. How is she, by the way?&quot;

Sei smiled. &quot;All grown up, little Yumi. She&#39;s so much more like Sachiko 
now; she&#39;s so mature. She ended up taking Sachiko&#39;s little cousin Touko 
as her petite soeur, I think. I don&#39;t see much of her anymore, but I try 
to, it&#39;s just too much fun teasing her. Have you kept in touch with 
Sachiko?&quot;

Youko shook her head. &quot;I try, but we&#39;re both busy. She&#39;s had a really 
tough time with the engagement. She&#39;s afraid of leaving Yumi behind. I 
think Kashiwagi went to study in America, so the wedding was postponed, 
but just for now. I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s killing Sachiko.&quot;

&quot;And Yumi.&quot; Sei responded matter-of-factly. 

&quot;Why would you say that?&quot;

Sei gestured wildly with her hands. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see it? She was head 
over heels for Sachiko since the first day that they met. She probably 
didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but she was already gone. She even said 
several times that she was in love with her.&quot;

But romantically? Sachiko loves her back? I thought she was in love with 
Kashiwagi, but things had changed dramatically that year. But Youko 
realized that she could not possibly doubt how deeply Yumi was in love 
with her petite soeur. Sachiko so guarded with her feelings, even with 
her, as close as they were, and it had overjoyed Youko to know that 
Sachiko was opening up to her, and that Yumi was going to be there to 
care for Sachiko. 

Sei took Youko&#39;s silence as doubt.

&quot;Youko, as a woman who knows about these types of things,&quot; as she lifted 
one eyebrow suggestively, &quot;I know it is romantic love. You have to have 
seen that, too.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know, but, poor Yumi and Sachiko,&quot; was all Youko could say. They 
would hold on to each other as long as they could, but they weren&#39;t sure 
what the future would hold. It was like a dark cloud looming over their 
heads, ready to dump something bad on them at any second. Kashiwagi 
couldn&#39;t stay in America forever, and unless something drastic happened 
Sachiko would become a married woman, and Yumi would have to pick up the 
pieces. Youko could remember Sei&#39;s face when she was parted from Shiori. 
It was heartbreaking. Youko cleared her throat and changed the subject. 
&quot;How are Rei and Yoshino?&quot;

&quot;Rei is fine, back home, I think, like you. Yoshino was mad that she 
left her, but she picked a cute little first year as her petite soeur, 
and I think she&#39;s even dating Yumi&#39;s brother. They make time to see each 
other. When I see the both of them, though, they still act like an old 
married couple. It&#39;s endearing.&quot;

Youko smiled. Rei and Yoshino had the oddest soeur relationship she had 
seen, but they were unwaveringly faithful to each other, even when 
parted. 

&quot;Is my Youko seeing anyone?&quot; Sei winked at Youko, instinctively reaching 
across to tweak her nose, but stopping herself just in time.

&quot;Not anymore. I&#39;ve dated a few people, but nothing serious.&quot; Sei wanted 
to press her friend further, feeling jealously and longing rise in her 
gut, but fought it back. &quot;Oh&quot;, was all she responded.

Youko sipped the last of her tea. &quot;And you?&quot; she asked, trying to sound 
off-handed.

&quot;I dated a girl named Kei for a little while, but were destined to be 
nothing more than good friends. She&#39;s wonderful, you&#39;ll have to meet her 
sometime.&quot;

Youko sighed a little. Her feelings for Sei had always been like a 
smoldering coal in her chest, and when she got too close to the former 
Rosa Gigentea, the coal grew hotter and hotter. Sitting so close to her 
was difficult, but she could manage. Besides, she had more important 
news than her unrequited love for Satou Sei. 

&quot;Sei, I saw Shiori.&quot;

Sei snapped to full attention, eyes wide. For a few seconds she didn&#39;t 
say anything, trying to ask questions with her expressive eyes. Her 
mouth made a few motions, then came one word. &quot;When?&quot;

Youko sighed. &quot;A few months ago when I was traveling. She did become a 
nun like she wanted, and she recognized me. She says that she&#39;s sorry.&quot; 
Youko couldn&#39;t go on, any more words choking in her throat. She felt 
like she was going to cry, and tried desperately to keep the tears from 
falling. 

All the memories came flooding back to Sei, Shiori&#39;s kiss, the 
rejection, and somewhere in the middle of it, was Youko, watching 
nervously, trying to save her.

Youko waited, nervously, for Sei&#39;s reaction as a lump formed in her 
throat, and the coal in her chest grew hotter still. Seconds ticked by, 
as Sei stared off into space. Youko played with the teacup, she felt an 
almost uncontrollable urge to squirm in her seat, even though she firmly 
believed that someone like her shouldn&#39;t. Finally, Sei looked up at her.

&quot;It seems so silly, doesn&#39;t it. When you look back on Lillian. The 
worries that we had, the drama that we caused, that was all nothing 
compared to the real world. But, despite that, I don&#39;t ever regret 
meeting any of the Yamayurikai. We always took care of each other, no 
matter what happened.&quot;

She sighed heavily. &quot;And when Shiori left me, you were the only one who 
really saw how hurt I was, how much trouble I had gotten myself into. 
You were strong, and calm, and you let me cry.&quot;

&quot;And through all these years I remembered what my onee-sama told me: 
&#39;you&#39;ll be glad you met her&#39; and that &#39;time heals all wounds&#39;. And every 
day that passed, it grew a little bit truer. I am glad I met her. 
Because I know I can heal. I know I can love again.&quot; Sei raised her 
eyes, meeting Youko&#39;s sorrowful gaze.

Youko could not respond. Sei reached across the table slowly, grabbed 
Youko&#39;s hand. &quot;I missed you, Youko.&quot;

The tears Youko had been holding back for years began to squeeze through 
her shut eyes, and she let out a little sob. She thought she was going 
to be fine. She thought they could act normal, like old friends do, so 
she wouldn&#39;t feel this lost, wouldn&#39;t feel this heartache...

Sei wordlessly moved around the table, standing on her knees next to the 
sobbing woman, wavering for a minute. She had never seen Youko cry, 
never seen her come close. The warmth in her eyes was flushed away with 
pain. Overcome with feeling, Sei wrapped her arms around Youko&#39;s middle 
and buried her head against her well-toned stomach. She felt something 
in her chest jump, something that hadn&#39;t jumped since she&#39;d last said 
goodbye to Youko.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she whispered desperately to the black haired woman.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

They cried together for a little while, and Youko let Sei hold her. 

After seconds, then minutes, Sei felt the sobs subside, and she raised 
her eyes to meet Youko&#39;s, who finally found her voice.

&quot;I loved you so much. I did. I still do.&quot;

All Sei could do was raise her lips to meet Youko&#39;s. 

Youko returned the kiss immediately, feeling the smoldering coal explode 
into a super nova as new feelings flooded her body. 

As they both parted for air, Sei realized that she hadn&#39;t felt this way 
since Shiori had kissed her. As both women looked into each other&#39;s 
eyes, Sei whispered up to Youko, &quot;I love you too.&quot;

Youko smiled widely, which Sei reflected. After a moment&#39;s silence, Sei 
spoke up.

&quot;Would you like to stay for dinner, Youko?&quot;

Youko kissed Sei on the forehead. &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

They didn&#39;t know what was going to happen in the future. But they did 
know that tonight, they would be together. 

And they could face tomorrow together.

-End
