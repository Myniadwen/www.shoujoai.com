<h1>Something to Believe (part 7 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a>

<a href="../marimite/sumbelieve-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Looking at the large platter of food the waitress placed in front of 
them, Yumi wondered at the wisdom of letting Touko choose for her. 
Although much of her anxiety had to do with the glint that hadn&#39;t left 
Touko&#39;s eyes since she suggested best place to get Thai food.

The restaurant was a charming family owned establishment complete with a 
staff who recognized Touko on sight. Perhaps a fondness for Touko 
explained the exorbitant amount of food they had been given.

Yumi was still eyeing the food as Touko said her thanks and quickly dug 
in. After a few moments, she noticed Yumi&#39;s hesitance and that tell tale 
glint appeared once again.

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; Touko began sweetly and Yumi&#39;s head jerked up. The younger 
girl was smiling warmly at her and proffering a bite of green curry on 
her fork. &quot;Try some?&quot;

Deciding to ignore whatever trepidation she felt, Yumi leaned forward to 
take the food into her mouth. And exactly five seconds after she 
finished eating, her mouth promptly set on fire. Or at least that&#39;s what 
it felt like.

&quot;Water,&quot; Yumi gasped, reaching for her glass of water and finishing it 
off quickly. She gratefully took Touko&#39;s drink from her as the other 
girl offered it. When she was done drinking and the blazing fire in her 
mouth died down to a slow steady burn, Yumi scowled at Touko as she 
said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you warn me?&quot;

&quot;Then you wouldn&#39;t have tried it,&quot; said Touko smoothly, taking a bite of 
the food that had just torched Yumi&#39;s taste buds and chewing happily. 
&quot;And I had to punish Yumi-sama somehow for her frequent manipulations, 
didn&#39;t I?&quot; Touko smiled, innocent and bright, tilting her head to one 
side, curls bouncing as she took another bite of her food. &quot;This seemed 
the most harmless way.&quot;

&quot;Touko-chan,&quot; Yumi reddened, looking guilty.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; said Touko calmly, carefully choosing her food and 
examining it closely. Lifting her eyes to look at Yumi, she said, &quot;I 
might go along with your plans but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve changed my 
mind Yumi-sama. I won&#39;t be your petite soeur.&quot;

&quot;I just want to know you,&quot; Yumi began, her eyes going wide, unsure what 
had brought this on. &quot;And I want you to know me. Really know me, 
Touko-chan. Until we do that how can you say no?&quot;

Taking another bite of her food, Touko looked at Yumi with a blas&eacute; 
expression and said, &quot;I told you I wouldn&#39;t interfere. That you could do 
as you wanted in your pursuit of me. But I never said it would change my 
mind about being your petite soeur.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; said Yumi in a whisper. &quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do to convince 
you? Why would you say that?&quot; Ducking her head and blinking her eyes to 
rid herself of any tears that might fall, she said brokenly, &quot;Do you 
hate me so much?&quot;

Staring at Yumi, a horrible sinking feeling welled in Touko&#39;s stomach 
and she had to picture Sachiko in order to go on. She was the reason for 
all this. Her beloved big sister who cared for her when no one else did. 
Who still loved Yumi, who still needed Yumi, who would never admit it, 
not even if it was for her own good. So Touko would do it for her, she 
would force Yumi to restart her fight for Sachiko by ending the battle 
for herself.

Even if it broke her own heart in the process.

&quot;I&#39;m doing this because I don&#39;t hate Yumi-sama,&quot; said Touko softly, 
causing the older girl to lift her eyes and look at her hopefully. 
Unable to help herself, Touko reached out for Yumi&#39;s hand, stroking the 
silken skin with her thumb. &quot;Sachiko-oneesama loves you and you love 
her. I might agree to be your petite soeur if I didn&#39;t know it meant 
trying to replace her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not--&quot; Yumi protested weakly.

&quot;Yumi-sama,&quot; chided Touko kindly, a smile playing on her lips. She 
gently shook the older girl&#39;s hand and said, &quot;You don&#39;t really want to 
do this. You only got the idea after Sachiko-oneesama told you that you 
needed a petite soeur, isn&#39;t that right?&quot;

Turning dark red, Yumi dropped her head only to look up with 
determination as she said, &quot;No. I know what I feel for you and Oneesama 
didn&#39;t cause that.&quot; Yumi took Touko&#39;s hand in hers and squeezed it 
gently, looking at the other girl earnestly. &quot;I care for you&#133; I want to 
know all of your favorite things, everything about you and that has 
nothing to do with Oneesama! Nothing at all.&quot;

Touko wanted to believe these words, wanted it so very badly but she 
couldn&#39;t. There was no way her mind could fathom Yumi choosing her over 
Sachiko. Not when real and true free will was involved. No, Yumi was 
forced into this by Sachiko&#39;s dull acceptance of her loveless future. 
Touko was simply a consolation prize, a second choice.

That was something Touko couldn&#39;t bear.

&quot;You might like me, Yumi-sama,&quot; said Touko quietly. She tilted her head, 
curls bouncing and she said winsomely, &quot;I am very cute and charming 
apparently.&quot; Her eyes had a serious light to them as she continued, &quot;But 
you love Sachiko-oneesama.&quot; Yumi&#39;s face fell and she smiled tenderly. 
&quot;Don&#39;t be so upset by it, Yumi-sama. I&#39;m not. In fact,&quot; Touko drawled, 
lifting up another piece of food and taking a bite. &quot;I&#39;m going to help 
you.&quot;

&quot;Help me?&quot; asked Yumi, perplexed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Touko easily, burying the terrible feeling of loss as she 
gave Yumi an encouraging look. &quot;Help with Sachiko-oneesama and ridding 
her of the foolish insistence that she has to be miserable with 
Suguru-neechan.&quot; She offered what she hoped with a bright smile. &quot;You do 
want that, don&#39;t you?&quot;

In a daze, lost as to how this conversation had come about, Yumi said 
vaguely, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Unaware that with this single word the wall around Touko&#39;s heart started 
to rebuild.

---

Kanako watched Yumi. Even when she felt betrayed by her, disillusioned 
by her real self, she watched her. There was just something about the 
older girl which captivated her. She wasn&#39;t the perfect innocent flower 
Kanako had first imagined but she was kind and wonderfully generous.

And she was hurting.

The last few weeks had been a rollercoaster for Yumi. She had watched 
her become withdrawn from Touko&#39;s rejection, elated from Touko&#39;s 
permission to pursue her, determined from Touko&#39;s resistance to her 
advances, and now hurting from what Kanako assumed to be Touko&#39;s second 
rejection. While Kanako could stand by and watch Yumi go through many 
things hurting was not one of them. Especially when she might help it to 
end.

She decided the wisest thing to do would be to go to the source of 
Yumi&#39;s problems. Although said source hardly seemed pleased to be in her 
presence. Nor very pleased at her choice of meeting place.

Frowning deeply, Touko inspected the greenhouse with a narrowed gaze 
then turned her attention to Kanako. &quot;Why are we here?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;I want to speak to you about Yumi-sama,&quot; said Kanako, her voice eerily 
clear and calm. &quot;I thought it best to do so in a place she loves.&quot;

Staring at the Rosa Chinensis bush, Touko&#39;s gaze was lidded and 
unbidden, an image of a smiling Yumi came into her mind. Shaking her 
head, wanting the image to leave, Touko looked at Kanako imperiously. 
&quot;Don&#39;t you think you should speak to Yumi-sama about things which 
concern her?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;Yumi-sama can&#39;t answer my question. Unfortunately, you are the only one 
who can do that,&quot; stated Kanako, not bothered in the slightest by 
Touko&#39;s abruptness.

&quot;Fine,&quot; said Touko coolly. &quot;Ask your question.&quot;

&quot;Why do you push Yumi-sama away when you&#39;re in love with her?&quot; asked 
Kanako, watching Touko with a steady gaze that calmly processed her 
reaction.

Her eyes wide, Touko&#39;s heart leapt and she quickly tried to stifle this 
response. Clenching her jaw, she looked away from the taller girl. Play 
the part of casual denial or just admit it and tell the truth? Touko was 
sorely tempted by the first option just because she disliked allowing 
Kanako to be right. Then she saw the small and disgustingly knowing 
smile Kanako wore and realized it was useless. She already knew she was 
right and that was why they were here.

&quot;Because she loves Sachiko-oneesama,&quot; said Touko reluctantly. The 
manners that had been hammered into her were the only thing that kept 
her from grinding her teeth in annoyance. She loathed to speak of her 
feelings, all her life anytime she did it never ended well. A subtle 
mocking or outright ignoring, those were the responses she received from 
her parents. So she learned to bury her feelings deep, far away, where 
it was like they never existed and therefore could never be hurt.

Then she met Sachiko and slowly she learned to trust and love. But just 
one person. Just Sachiko. She was special and Touko vowed it was her 
alone she could trust. Slowly she watched Sachiko change. Become lighter 
and filled with a genuine appreciation for life. She heard the reason 
for this, listened to the name reverently slip from Sachiko&#39;s lips. 
Fukuzawa Yumi. At first, she was jealous, horribly so. Sachiko had 
always been like her, that was why Touko trusted her, loved her, and now 
this Yumi appears and that all changes?

Touko wanted to hate her. Had been planning on hating her, in fact, but 
then Yumi came rushing through the door, gasping for breath and so very 
earnest in her apology to Sachiko. She could see then how much Sachiko 
meant to Yumi and that hatred and jealously slowly left her. Even in the 
beginning, Touko thought she loved her. Trusted her? No. Liked her? Not 
always. Understood her? Certainly not. But Touko loved her for making 
Sachiko happy. She never meant to fall in love herself. Honestly, she 
hadn&#39;t. If anything she had been trying so very hard to prevent it 
because she knew in the end it would bring nothing but pain.

&quot;Having me as a petite soeur is Yumi-sama&#39;s way of trying to replace 
Sachiko-oneesama. But they still love each other,&quot; Touko stared down 
Kanako, her gaze flashing dangerously before she spoke again. &quot;And that 
is why I push her away.&quot;

Quietly taking this in, Kanako dipped her head in a nod of satisfaction. 
Touko was turning to leave when the taller girl said, &quot;Yumi-sama isn&#39;t 
happy though.&quot;

&quot;She will be,&quot; said Touko tightly, looking over her shoulder at Kanako. 
&quot;Once she&#39;s back with Sachiko-oneesama.&quot;

&quot;And what if she doesn&#39;t go back to the Rosa Chinensis?&quot; asked Kanako, 
lifting an eyebrow and observing Touko as if she was some curious 
science experiment. &quot;What will you do then?&quot;

No reply came from Touko other than the final and forceful click of the 
greenhouse door closing.</pre>
