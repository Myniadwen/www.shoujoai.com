<h1>Something to Believe (part 8 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sumbelieve-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>It had taken weeks but after much poking and prodding and the saddest of 
expressions, Touko had gotten Sachiko to agree to come over for a quiet 
dinner at her house. With an equal amount of poking and prodding and a 
playfully pleading expression, Touko had gotten Yumi to agree to the 
same thing. And with a bit of luck and some clever tactics, she arranged 
those quiet dinners to take place on the same day without either girl 
having knowledge of it. While Touko was sure that Yumi hadn&#39;t spoke to 
Sachiko of her plans for their romantic reunion she knew Yumi was 
reluctant to go through with any plotting this might involve.

Which left everything up to Touko. Though she wasn&#39;t alone in her task. 
Mostly because a certain someone refused to let her be. Especially when 
it came to matters involving Yumi. It was really quite annoying but 
somehow charming at the same time. Perhaps because Touko knew their 
worry and constant presence was the true sign of a friend. The first 
real one she ever had.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re doing this,&quot; Noriko remarked, watching as 
Touko opened the boxes of food she ordered for the dinner.

&quot;How many times have I told you?&quot; said Touko with irritation, looking up 
from her task. &quot;Sachiko-oneesama is still in love with Yumi-sama no 
matter how much she denies it. They&#39;re not happy apart so I&#39;m helping to 
bring them back together. Why is that so hard for everyone to 
understand?&quot;

&quot;Everyone?&quot; questioned Noriko, lifting an eyebrow. &quot;I thought I was the 
only one who knew about your plan.&quot;

Forming a scowl as she opened another box of food, Touko said, &quot;Hosokawa 
Kanako cornered me in the greenhouse a week ago. She wanted to know why 
Yumi-sama has been so sad.&quot; Scowling deeply, Touko exclaimed, &quot;Like she 
has the right to ask! The way she treated Yumi-sama before. Just because 
she didn&#39;t live up to whatever warped ideal Hosokawa had in her mind.&quot;

&quot;What did you tell her?&quot; Noriko pursued, amused by how Kanako always 
managed to irritate her friend. Touko was a passionate person but she 
could be extremely closed off with her feelings at times. But whenever 
it came to the taller girl something seemed to make the part of Touko&#39;s 
personality that was controlled with her emotions completely snap. 
Noriko wondered if it had to do animosity over sharing Yumi&#39;s affections 
or it was something deeper.

&quot;I told her about my plan of course,&quot; Touko sniffed, arranging the food 
carefully on a plate. &quot;Not that it was any of her business.&quot;

&quot;And what did she think about the plan?&quot; asked Noriko, genuinely curious 
about the taller girl&#39;s reaction.

Touko&#39;s cheeks grew red at this question and turning to her friend, 
looking as if she was trying to repress an embarrassing memory, she 
tossed her hair carelessly over her shoulder. &quot;Her opinion is hardly 
important,&quot; Touko declared.

&quot;Right,&quot; said Noriko skeptically. Seeing that Touko wasn&#39;t going to tell 
her what really went on with Kanako, she turned her attention to the 
reason for food preparation. &quot;When are they going to be here?&quot;

Looking at the clock, Touko frowned. &quot;Fifteen minutes.&quot; Waving her hands 
at Noriko in a flitting movement, she said, &quot;That means you need to 
leave. I told you when you got here that you had to be gone by the time 
they arrived. If they see you here they&#39;ll know something is going on.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; said Noriko in dry amusement, shaking her head. She 
followed Touko to the door, gathering her book bag up and looking at the 
other girl with a concerned light in her eyes. &quot;Call me tonight, okay? I 
know this isn&#39;t easy for you, no matter how much you deny it.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s hard about putting two people who love one another together 
again?&quot; asked Touko, flashing an arrogant smile.

&quot;Touko,&quot; Noriko murmured her name sadly. She reached out to touch her 
friend&#39;s cheek, her hand falling short when the other girl ducked her 
head to hide from her. Releasing a sigh, she set her book bag down and 
took a step closer, placing a gentle hand on the top of Touko&#39;s head. 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to act strong around me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not an act,&quot; muttered Touko, hands clenching and unclenching, her 
head staying lowered. &quot;If I wasn&#39;t strong I couldn&#39;t do this. I 
couldn&#39;t&#133;&quot; Touko trailed off, her hands balled up into fists and her 
body trembling violently.

&quot;Give Yumi-sama up?&quot; Noriko finished for her. Her hand fell from Touko&#39;s 
head, joining the other to wrap around the other girl&#39;s waist and pull 
her in for a hug. Lowering her head, Noriko murmured in her ear, &quot;I know 
you&#39;re strong. You just don&#39;t have to be that way all the time. 
Especially around me. I know it must be hard for you.&quot;

More trembling and Touko&#39;s arms went around Noriko, clutching to her for 
a long moment before she said shakily, &quot;I can&#39;t do this now. I have to 
get the dinner ready and if they see me like this they&#39;ll know something 
is going on.&quot;

&quot;Call me,&quot; insisted Noriko, reaching down to lift Touko&#39;s chin up. 
Pressing her hand flat against the other girl&#39;s cheek, she offered a 
kind smile. &quot;Promise?&quot;

&quot;I promise,&quot; said Touko softly. She shook her head and formed an 
expression of put upon exasperation and agitatedly waved at the other 
girl. &quot;Now get going! I have to get ready. They&#39;ll be here any minute.&quot;

One last hug and Noriko slipped out the door, leaving Touko to her last 
minute dinner preparations. The hardest thing, Touko realized, was 
making the setting romantic without it being too romantic. It was hard 
enough to arrange it so Sachiko would arrive precisely before Yumi 
without either of them tipping the other off just to have everything 
ruined by candlelight and roses. Though they didn&#39;t really need things 
like that since Yumi and Sachiko already loved each other. It was just 
circumstance and Sachiko&#39;s stubbornness that was keeping them apart. So 
a romantic atmosphere wasn&#39;t really needed in this case. Although it 
would have been nice.

Touko was busy arranging the plates and pitcher of sparkling cider 
perfectly on the table when the doorbell rang. Glancing down at her 
watch, a triumphant smile formed on her face. Right on time, Touko said 
to herself as she walked to the front door, let the plan begin.

&quot;Sachiko-oneesama,&quot; said Touko happily, smiling at the older girl who 
stood at the front door, looking off into the distance. &quot;Come inside.&quot; 
Sachiko stepped inside and removed her coat. &quot;I have all of your 
favorites, including fresh apple cider.&quot;

Eyeing the empty house speculatively, Sachiko murmured, &quot;Are we alone?&quot;

&quot;Mother and Father are at some charity function,&quot; said Touko 
dismissively, hanging Sachiko&#39;s coat in the closet. She turned back to 
the other girl with a bright smile on her face, curls bouncing as she 
neared. &quot;Something very boring that I had no interest in attending. Not 
that they asked me.&quot;

&quot;Touko,&quot; said Sachiko softly, a worried light emerging in her eyes. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to speak with you&#133; I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t do more to 
help with Auntie and Uncle as well as that business with the drama 
club.&quot; Taking a step forward, she clasped the smaller girl&#39;s shoulders, 
her eyes dark in their concern and care. &quot;I know how Yumi helped you 
back then but still, I should have done something. You are my cousin and 
so very dear to me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Touko murmured, shaking her head and forming a 
wavering smile that did its best to take away any worries Sachiko might 
have. &quot;There wasn&#39;t anything you could have done, Sachiko-oneesama, not 
when it comes to my parents. And Yumi-sama resolved things very nicely 
with the drama club if I might say so myself.&quot;

&quot;She did, didn&#39;t she?&quot; said Sachiko fondly. &quot;I was so proud of her.&quot;

&quot;I was grateful for her help,&quot; remarked Touko, hooking her arm through 
Sachiko&#39;s and leading her into the dining room, well aware that Yumi 
would be arriving any minute. &quot;Yumi-sama has been very kind to me. 
You&#39;re very lucky to have found such a wonderful petite soeur, 
Sachiko-oneesama.&quot; Touko paused as they arrived at the dining table and 
looking up into the older girl&#39;s eyes, her gaze was unwavering in its 
strength and knowledge. &quot;She loves you completely.&quot;

&quot;Touko?&quot; Sachiko questioned, a slight frown marring her perfect 
features.

Remaining silent for a long moment, Touko sighed and said, &quot;I apologize 
for speaking out of turn but I must tell you that Yumi-sama is still in 
love with you. Sachiko-oneesama,&quot; Touko spoke softly but almost sternly. 
&quot;She suffers when she&#39;s apart from you. I know why you&#39;re doing this&#133; 
trying to put her together with me but it won&#39;t make her forget you 
because you&#39;re in her heart always.&quot; Sachiko opened her mouth to reply 
when the doorbell rang sharply in the air and looking to the older girl 
with an apologetic expression, Touko said, &quot;That must be the dessert.&quot; 
When Sachiko looked at her in obvious surprise, Touko laughed gaily. 
&quot;Sachiko-oneesama! Surely you didn&#39;t think I made all of this myself? Or 
have you blocked out what happened the last time I attempted to use my 
culinary skills?&quot;

&quot;It was a spectacular fire for only one small souffle,&quot; said Sachiko, 
humor lacing her tones. Touko moved to exit the dining room but Sachiko 
stopped her with a gentle hold to her wrist. When the younger girl 
turned back to look at her with wide questioning eyes, Sachiko said 
quietly, &quot;We will continue our conversation when you return. Whether it 
be considered out of turn or not, Touko.&quot;

Nodding her head in reply, Touko quickly left the dining room and headed 
to the front door. Opening it to reveal Yumi who quickly spun around and 
offered a smile that held as much anxiety as hope in it. &quot;Touko-chan,&quot; 
Yumi breathed, taking a step forward. &quot;Thank you again for inviting me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Yumi-sama,&quot; Touko chided, pulling the older girl into 
her house and closing the front door quietly. All while trying to ignore 
the longing way that Yumi was looking at her. &quot;It&#39;s only dinner. There&#39;s 
nothing to thank me for.&quot;

Silence and Touko half expected for Yumi to exclaim that anytime spent 
with her precious Touko-chan was something to be thankful for but it 
never came. Instead Yumi looked at her with dark brown eyes that were 
solemn and searching but searching for what Touko had no idea. Forming a 
nervous smile, Touko took the older girl&#39;s hand and led her to the 
dining room. Opening the door, she murmured, &quot;Don&#39;t be angry with me, 
Yumi-sama, but I&#39;ve planned a surprise for you. And please,&quot; Touko 
paused, looking long and hard into Yumi&#39;s eyes, a hint of pleading 
present. &quot;Tell her not to be angry with me as well.&quot;

&quot;Touko-chan?&quot; asked Yumi with some confusion, blinking at the younger 
girl as she found herself gently propelled into the dining room with the 
door closing behind her with a quiet click. Facing forward, her eyes 
widened at the sight of Sachiko who looked at her with an identical 
expression of surprise on her features. &quot;Oneesama? What are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;Falling for a clever trick, I would suppose,&quot; murmured Sachiko, eyeing 
the closed doors of the dining room. &quot;And you?&quot;

Following Sachiko&#39;s gaze to the closed doors, Yumi said, &quot;I thought I 
was having dinner with Touko-chan.&quot; Turning back to Sachiko, she moved 
towards the older girl and said, &quot;I don&#39;t think Touko-chan was trying to 
trick us, oneesama. She&#39;s just&#133;&quot; Yumi trailed off, lowering her head, 
unable to meet her grande soeur&#39;s penetrating gaze. &quot;She&#39;s just trying 
to help.&quot;

&quot;Help how?&quot; questioned Sachiko. A moment of hesitation as Yumi looked up 
at her only to quickly lower her head again and Sachiko thought back to 
what Touko had said to her before Yumi&#39;s arrival. Seeing the guilt and 
fear that her petite soeur held in her stance, Sachiko knew immediately 
what this was. Though she wasn&#39;t sure why the younger girl had allowed 
herself to get talked into this. &quot;Yumi,&quot; Sachiko murmured, walking to 
the other girl and gently reaching out to cup her chin in a tender hold. 
&quot;Please look at me.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Yumi, a sob in her voice, shaking her head. &quot;I thought this 
might be what Touko-chan was planning but I didn&#39;t say anything to you, 
oneesama. Because I wanted to be here&#133; having this dinner with you even 
though I know it&#39;s not what you want.&quot;

&quot;Yumi,&quot; Sachiko said her name in surprise, eyes going wide, lifting her 
petite soeur&#39;s chin up so she could look her in the eyes. &quot;Why would you 
say such a thing? I would always welcome a chance to spend time with 
you, no matter the circumstances.&quot;

Shaking her head again, Yumi stepped away from Sachiko and hugging 
herself, she said in a tiny voice, &quot;Not like this. Not like I want and 
not like Touko-chan has planned.&quot;

It was then that Sachiko took note of how the dining room was arranged, 
the mood wasn&#39;t overpowering but it was romantic nonetheless, and it was 
then that she realized exactly what her cousin had been planning for her 
dinner with Yumi this night. Suddenly her final words took a much more 
powerful meaning and swallowing the lump in her throat, Sachiko&#39;s tones 
were almost rough as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve explained this to you&#133; I thought 
you understood.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever really understand, oneesama,&quot; whispered Yumi, 
looking heartbroken. &quot;Not as long as I love you.&quot;

---

Spying was wrong, Touko knew that. But then again, tricking your elders 
is wrong too and she had done that quite effectively with very little 
quibbles from her conscious so what was the difference? Besides, she 
wanted to know so very badly if her plan was working. She was far too 
much of a realist to think Sachiko and Yumi immediately flew into each 
others arms upon being left alone in the dining room but perhaps, at the 
very least, they were talking about their issues and Yumi was making 
Sachiko see what a fool she was for trying to push their love aside.

Feeling something like a peeping tom, Touko positioned herself at porch 
outside of the dining room, pushing the outer door open just a crack so 
she could hear what was going on inside. From her hiding position she 
could perfectly see Sachiko and Yumi who were involved in a deep 
discussion.

&quot;Why won&#39;t you at least think about what I&#39;ve said?&quot; Yumi cried, her 
hands flying out to grasp at Sachiko&#39;s sleeves.

Looking away from her petite soeur, Sachiko murmured, &quot;The wedding date 
has already been set, Yumi. I don&#39;t know what there is to think about.&quot; 
The younger girl released a quiet cry at this and Sachiko wore a 
stricken expression as she turned to her. Holding her face in a gentle 
grasp, she wiped her tears away, wearing a tormented expression as she 
did so. &quot;Please don&#39;t look that way,&quot; Sachiko pleaded softly. &quot;Why do 
you think I told you to forget about me and to be with Touko? I knew I 
would cause you pain&#133; make you cry like this and she never would. She&#39;s 
braver than I am, Yumi, and she won&#39;t hurt you. Not when she realizes 
you truly do love her.&quot;

&quot;You always talk about Touko-chan,&quot; said Yumi in a quiet accusation, 
looking up with eyes that held as much hurt as anger. &quot;But you never 
speak about yourself, oneesama. What about what you feel? You say the 
wedding date has been set but is having a wedding what you really want?&quot; 
Sachiko turned her gaze away from Yumi at this question and the younger 
girl seemed to bristle at this. Reaching up with a determined look on 
her features, she held the taller girl&#39;s face in her hands and focused 
Sachiko&#39;s attention back onto her. &quot;Is it what you want?&quot; Yumi 
reinforced, her voice steely and unwavering.

&quot;What I want,&quot; Sachiko whispered, closing her eyes painfully as her head 
fell to rest on Yumi&#39;s shoulders.

Yumi&#39;s arms instantly wrapped Sachiko up in a loving embrace and Touko 
was struck by the beauty until her vision blurred with so many tears she 
couldn&#39;t look anymore. Hastily wiping her tears away, Touko took a 
shuddering breath and reminded herself this is what she wanted. Sachiko 
admitting that she didn&#39;t want to marry Suguru, that she wanted Yumi, 
now and always. Wiping more of her tears away, wishing they would stop 
falling and that her stupid heart would stop feeling as if it was 
breaking. This was her plan and it had succeeded, she was right all 
along. Sachiko did still love Yumi and Yumi&#133;

Shaking her head furiously, Touko didn&#39;t want to think about what Yumi 
felt. Because if she did then she would have to acknowledge that perhaps 
Yumi never felt anything for her. That she was what she had always 
suspected deep down, merely a poor replacement for Sachiko. Releasing a 
shuddering sob as she walked back into the house, Touko decided she 
wouldn&#39;t wait until later to call Noriko.

That much, at least, she could do for herself.

---

&quot;What I want doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Sachiko whispered sadly, her breath warm 
on Yumi&#39;s skin. &quot;The wedding date is still set.&quot;

&quot;How can you say that?&quot; demanded Yumi angrily, pushing her grande soeur 
back to look up at her with flashing eyes. &quot;It matters to me! It should 
matter you! Oneesama,&quot; Yumi said in a desperate plea. &quot;Do you love 
Suguru? Do you want to marry him?&quot;

Lifting her head slowly, a twisted smile pulling at her lips, Sachiko 
murmured, &quot;My family wants it, so I must.&quot; Looking away from Yumi, she 
continued quietly, &quot;You should go. I&#39;ll remain and speak with Touko. She 
needs to understand she must give up this plan of hers.&quot;

&quot;What about me?&quot; asked Yumi, tears lacing her voice. &quot;Don&#39;t I need to 
give up? Or does what I feel or want not even matter?&quot;

&quot;Yumi,&quot; Sachiko said her name brokenly, reaching out to clasp the 
younger girl&#39;s shoulders. When Yumi shrugged her hands off, Sachiko 
gazed at her sadly then murmured, &quot;I know you must hate me but I&#39;m not a 
brave person. I never have been. All of my life, everything has revolved 
around my family and their desires, their plans for me. I never had the 
strength to go against them. Then oneesama took me for her petite soeur 
and she made me do things for myself for the first time in my life and 
for a time, I loved it, that freedom she gave to me. But it wasn&#39;t 
anything meant to last because they are my family always. I might not 
want to marry Suguru but I do want for them to be happy and they will be 
if I&#133;&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be happy if you marry a man you don&#39;t love?&quot; Yumi said 
incredulously. &quot;Oneesama, you can&#39;t believe that.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Sachiko in desolate tones.

No one understood what it meant to be an Ogasawara, no one except 
perhaps the man she was going to marry. Suguru felt that same stifling 
pressure from his family, that all encompassing need to make them happy, 
to live up to their expectations because if you didn&#39;t there was that 
horrible sinking feeling you could lose them and if that happened who 
would you be then? No one of any importance because all of their lives 
it had been stressed to them it was the family that mattered, the name 
and reputation of the group as a whole was valued, not the individual.

&quot;You&#39;re right I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Yumi with certain frustration. 
&quot;And I&#39;m not sure I ever want to.&quot; She was quiet for a long moment then 
she looked at Sachiko who was staring away from her, out the long 
windows of the dining room, an empty expression on her face. &quot;This is it 
then, isn&#39;t it? I won&#39;t be able to say anything to convince you that 
this isn&#39;t right. That you shouldn&#39;t throw away your wants for theirs.&quot;

Continuing to face away from Yumi, holding herself tight for comfort, 
Sachiko said slowly and softly, &quot;I&#39;ve always relied on my family for so 
very much and the thought of refusing a request they make of me&#133; it 
isn&#39;t something I can do. But Touko is different. She&#39;s part of my 
family, yes, but she doesn&#39;t let them control her. If the reason was 
strong enough, she would go against them.&quot;

&quot;Oneesama?&quot; said Yumi in a whisper.

&quot;Touko won&#39;t be afraid to love you,&quot; Sachiko continued on, as if Yumi 
had never spoken. Looking back at her petite soeur, she gave a wavering 
smile. &quot;I&#39;ve known from the beginning, that&#39;s why I suggested her to 
you. I thought if I couldn&#39;t be with you then she could and I knew that 
she would make you happy. At least, once she believed you returned her 
feelings.&quot;

&quot;Oneesama, I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Yumi frowned, moving towards her grande 
soeur. &quot;What about Touko-chan&#39;s feelings?&quot;

Dark amusement sparked in her eyes only to fade into a bleak melancholy 
and Sachiko said, &quot;She&#39;s in love with you, Yumi.&quot;</pre>
