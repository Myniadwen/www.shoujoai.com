<h1>Never Enough Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/okamiyuri.html">Okami no Yuri</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Some things to know 

Baka - idiot 

Onee-sama - Sister 

Yamiyurikai - The Student Council 

The Roses - The Roses are the three third year students that run the 
Yamiyurikai. They consist of Rosa Gigantea - Shimako, Rosa Foetida - 
Rei, and Rosa Chinesis - Sachiko. 

Rosa en Buton - Basically French for Rose Bud. They are the petite 
Soeurs to the Roses and normally are the ones to take their place next 
year at the Yamiyurikai. 

Rosary - A cross that is given by the school to the students. It is an 
important item in the Soeur system; the older students place the rosary 
around the younger student&#39;s neck and make them their petite soeur. 

The story takes place at the Lillian School for Girls, it is an all 
girls Catholic School and runs on a Soeur system. Soeur is the French 
Word for Sister. The older students take in a younger student to be 
their Petite Soeur. My Story is a fan-fic based off of the main Soeur 
couple from Maria-sama Ga Miteru - Yumi and Sachiko, the anime has some 
Shoujo elements to it and most fan-art is under Yuri due to the extreme 
tension that they push on the girl&#39;s relationships with their Soeurs. 
Although it is still debated on what is what, I wanted to post a story 
based off of Sachiko and Yumi. 

This story is 14 days long and might take some time; I am no good at 
writing, sorry.

~DAY 1~ 


Yumi busted threw the gate quickly breathing heavily, her chest heaving. 
Her short hair was pulled up in pony tails like every day, today wearing 
red ties. ? Sachiko-sama is going to be so mad.? She thought in peril, 
how could she have been so stupid. This was common of the second year 
student; often making a silly mistake and arriving late even to the most 
important event. However she felt she had to, she needed to look perfect 
today and spent allot of her time fixing her hair up, that was very like 
her, over analyzing her decisions afraid of what Sachiko might think if 
she did anything wrong, always walking on a trapeze wire. To Yumi it 
felt so surreal and she tried to ignore the fact that Sachiko would be 
graduating in two weeks. They had been at Lillian for 2 years together 
and to Yumi it felt so unrealistic to find someone like Sachiko, she was 
perfect in everyway so elegant in everything she did and to Yumi she was 
an angel sent from heaven. Her steps slowed down as she saw the figure 
of a tall girl standing in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, the 
woman&#39;s hair was long and blue, her body covered in a dark green 
uniform. 

&quot;Onee-sama?&quot; She asked as she stood a few feet away looking at her feet 
embarrassed for being late, they promised to meet by the statue every 
morning until Sachiko had to leave. Sachiko was in her third year and 
had the title of Rosa Chinesis; she had come from a wealthy family and 
was often very closed up emotionally. She could be so cold and serious 
Yumi would feel shivers, yet would be so kind as to even wipe Yumi&#39;s 
mouth when she had coughed while drinking, times like that were often 
some of Yumi&#39;s most cherished memories. It was not so often the two had 
their differences, like how Sachiko ate everything with a fork and knife 
including her sandwiches, or the face that Yumi would use improper 
edicate while eating. The older girl turned around with a blank mouth 
and cold eyes, but a smile quickly formed on her lips as she took in the 
sight of her petite soeur always doing something to draw attention when 
she normally wanted to stay quiet, it made her giggle a bit 

&quot;Your late Yumi-chan&quot; She said lovingly and Yumi quickly rose her head 
hearing Sachiko&#39;s tone and scurried quickly to her side. Both put their 
hands together and bowed in front of the statue as a quick prayer. 
That&#39;s when Yumi remembered that the meeting at the Rose Mansion was 
cancelled due to the fact that Rei and Yoshino were busy with kendo 
club. 

&quot;Yumi-chan?&quot; Sachiko said as soon as they finished and the 2nd year 
stared at her quizzically. &quot;Yes, Onee-sama?&quot; Sachiko took Yumi&#39;s hand 
and held it tightly. 

&quot;Let me walk you to class&quot; Her cheeks became a deep red as she stared up 
at Sachiko and gulped her heart beating faster 

&quot;O-Ok....&quot; She said and they walked to toward the Math Hall. Yumi was 
trying to keep her breath steady now; Sachiko&#39;s hand was so soft yet 
held hers so firmly, the 2nd Year couldn&#39;t help it as she kept worrying 
about all the little things. Was her hand sweating, would Sachiko be 
disgusted with her if she was? Or maybe she wasn&#39;t holding her hand 
right, was there even a way to hold someone&#39;s hand right? She kept 
pondering all the bad responses. 

&quot;We&#39;re here&quot; Yumi looked around 

&quot;Wha...?&quot; She saw her classroom door and sighed, she spent that whole 
time worrying about things instead of enjoying it. 

&quot;I will see you at lunch&quot; She said and let go of her hand patting her 
shoulder then walking off. Yumi blushed and waved slightly 

&quot;Yes Onee-sama&quot; she replied nodding then walked inside to see the girls 
staring at her. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 

The group seems to stare at her like she was an alien, until a girl with 
two long French braids and slightly pale skin pushed through. She was 
Yoshino another member of the Yamiyurikai and the Rosa en buton to Rosa 
Foetida. Ever since last year Yoshino was much more active after her 
surgery, she was one of the feistiest girls at the school and if you 
told her it was impossible, she would do it anyways even at the cost of 
her own limbs. Yoshino pushed threw and grabbed Yumi&#39;s wrist pulling her 
to the corner of the class 

&quot;Yoshino-san, what&#39;s going on?&quot; She asked seeing some of the others 
still staring 

&quot;Well Tsutako....&quot; she pointed at Tsutako who was showing her camera to 
a group of girls and telling them a story that was obviously attracting 
alot of attention. &#39;Tsutako.....&#39; Yumi whined inside, she was always 
doing this. Taking a picture of something than exploiting it like a 
parasite, if it weren&#39;t for them being friends Yumi might....... no she 
wouldn&#39;t even if they were worst enemies Yumi was way to passive to do 
anything and Tsutako would just end up making a story out of it in the 
end, she sighed. 

&quot;Like I was saying Tsutako was up in the English dorm taking pictures of 
the cherry blossoms and some students when she.... well saw you and Rosa 
Chinesis together and focused in for a picture, she saw you blushing and 
then she claims Rosa Chinesis was holding your hand. Ever since she has 
been at class telling everyone about it.&quot; Yumi blushed, her eyes widened 
as she thought of the newspaper club giving headlines for it in their 
next issue. Touko was going to find her and yell at her, Mami-san and 
Minako would try and get an interview. And when Sachiko is to find 
out..... She buried her face into the desk. She heard someone laugh and 
pat her back. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Yumi-chan?&quot; Yumi jumped and turned 

&quot;Most girls would be glad to get so close to Rosa Chinesis&quot; Yoshino 
interrupted by dropping her book on the table. 

&quot;Tsutako-san, why are you here?&quot; The girl fixed her glasses and grinned 

&quot;First off Yumi is a good friend of mine.&quot; This was true, they had known 
each other since Middle School &quot;Secondly, because I need Yumi&#39;s 
permission for the newspaper club to use this...&quot; She pulled out a photo 
of Sachiko holding Yumi&#39;s hand by the statue of Mary. Immediately she 
tried to grab it only so the photographer would hold it above her head. 

&quot;You know the rules, if you want it you have to give me yours, and 
Sachiko&#39;s permission&quot; 

She smiled &quot;Well just tell me when you do&quot; She grinned and walked off 

&quot;But...&quot; Yumi called only to be silenced by the bell and sat down in her 
seat the rest of the class doing nothing, but worry about her situation. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 

&quot;Oh... ok see you Yoshino-san&quot; Yumi said and waved as Yoshino walked 
off. She had to help Rei train at the Kendo Club again, however she did 
promise this time that her and Rei would be able to go to the meeting, 
which was good news for her and Sachiko since the Yamiyurikai was 
already slightly short-handed. 

&quot;Ah!&quot; She said and finally remembered hurrying off, Sachiko was probably 
in the greenhouse waiting for her, &#39;Oh please don&#39;t be mad Onee-sama&#39; 
she thought pleading with herself to get the image of her Onee-sama&#39;s 
angered face out of her head. She made it outside and turned the corner 
and stopped dead in her tracks &#39;Shimako-chan!&#39; Shimako was another 
second year, only since a former third year of the Yamiyurikai made her 
a petite soeur last year, she was left to take the title of Rosa 
Gigantea, so proper and deep, beautiful with wavy golden brown hair 
looked near heavenly as the petals of the Cherry Blossom trees fell on 
her. The site was one that most students would find awe-inspiring in 
itself as she stood with her flowing in the wind, however there was more 
to this site. A young girl was being held tenderly in her arms, and what 
Yumi saw made her blush. Noriko, Shimako&#39;s petite Soeur short black 
hair, and very temperamental. She was only at Lillian on an accident, 
and has the desire to become a Buddhist, but was never once rejected for 
this fact despite the school being a catholic one. The two were near 
exact opposites, but that is not what was being shown here. Holding each 
other in a tight embrace as the wind passed through there their hairs 
and a tornado of pink petals swirling around them. 

Yumi blushed watching, but not them, at least not after awhile. Two new 
faces seemed to form on Shimako and Noriko... in fact even their bodies 
seemed different, her eyes widened as she saw herself behind held by 
Sachiko. Sachiko&#39;s lips saying inaudible words that made her illusion 
blush and lean upward, so close... why was she thinking about this? 
Almost touching, breathing on each other... Sachiko&#39;s soft hands holding 
her cheeks 

&quot;Onee-sama...... I....&quot; A hand touched her shoulder suddenly and Yumi 
went flying 

&quot;Ah!!!&quot; She screamed and fell into the open on her butt, Shimako and 
Noriko letting each other go and rushing to her side. 

&quot;Sorry Yumi-chan.....&quot; it was a familiar voice from above &quot;Onee-sama!&quot; 
Yumi said and hopped to her feet. 

&quot;Did I scare you?&quot; Sachiko asked looking concerned 

&quot;No.... I was just surprised...&quot; Her head darted to her feet. 

&quot;Yumi-san&quot; Noriko was tapping Yumi&#39;s shoulder until Yumi finally turned 
to look &quot;What were you doing?&quot; Noriko gave a cold stare 

&quot;Sorry... I was going to the green house...and...&quot; She was trying to 
think up an excuse 

&quot;And what!?&quot; Noriko said quickly getting annoyed, Yumi was trying to get 
out words, but she couldn&#39;t how could she say what she was doing.... 

&quot;I was....&quot; Sachiko moved in front of Yumi 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Rosa Gigantea and Noriko&quot; She said referring to Shimako and 
her petite Soeur, 

&quot;Me and Yumi were going to the greenhouse and we didn&#39;t want to disturb 
you two, isn&#39;t that right?&quot; Yumi looked up at Sachiko, she was so calm 
and cool, coming to her rescue like a knight right when she needed her. 
Finally shaken from her dreamy state, the young girl responded. 

&quot;Y-Yes...&quot; She said and bowed &quot;Sorry Noriko-san and Shimako-chan&quot; 
Sachiko held Yumi&#39;s wrist 

&quot;Please don&#39;t let this incident bother you.&quot; Sachiko said and began to 
drag Yumi along, however Yumi didn&#39;t mind it one bit; in fact she 
enjoyed being led along by Sachiko. 

&quot;Umm..... Sachiko-sama...&quot; Shimako interjected with a soft kind voice &quot;I 
have a favor to ask of you and Yumi.&quot; She smiled sweetly and they both 
turned 

&quot;Yes?&quot; The both said in unison and Yumi looked down blushing a bit. 
Shimako smiled at this 

&quot;Me and Noriko have a date planned on Saturday, but.... we have both 
never actually been on a real one, since you and Yumi are so close, I 
was hoping you would accompany us.&quot; Noriko seemed to have something to 
say, but Shimako waved her off. 

&quot;We accept, think of it as an apology for disturbing you&quot; Sachiko 
responded immediately, Yumi blushed, but smiled a bit the way she was so 
smart and assertive made Yumi happy, but she quickly regained composure 
and stood trying not to look stupid in front of Sachiko. 

&quot;It&#39;s getting late and me and Yumi-chan have to eat lunch. See you 
tomorrow Shimako-san and Noriko-san&quot; She said and walked off 

&quot;Ah... See you soon&quot; Yumi said quickly as Sachiko led her down the brick 
path to the green house. 

Noriko sighed once they were gone &quot;We don&#39;t have a date planned 
Shimako-chan...&quot; She said slightly confused. Shimako smiled 

&quot;I&#39;ve only known them for a bit, but Sachiko isn&#39;t as comfortable with 
her feelings and will never do anything romantic without a push, and 
Yumi-san is so disingenuous and keeps things bottled up, so it would be 
impossible for her to reveal how she feels.&quot; Noriko looked at Shimako, 
smiling a bit. &quot;Your very considerate Shimako-chan.&quot; She said and put 
her arms around Shimako again 

&quot;They are our friends so we should do what we need to assure them 
happiness, so on Saturday we have to do everything to nudge them closer 
together.&quot; She pressed against Noriko. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, leave it all to me!&quot; She smiled and cuddled into Shimako. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 

Sachiko smiled and opened the door, the sent of the roses was filling 
the air and both Yumi and Sachiko took in the aromatic fragrance. 

&quot;Ah, Onee-sama it smells so great in here, even better then the last 
time we were in here&quot; She said and giggled to herself. Sachiko sat down 

&quot;The gardening club planted new flowers awhile back and they are coming 
into bloom, I wanted us to see them together.&quot; Yumi turned to see 
Sachiko, she held her hands behind her back, Yumi&#39;s cheeks becoming red 
as she watched, such a beauty surrounded by the red roses the light of 
the sun glimmered around her. Yumi looked at the floor trying to hide 
her face, but she soon after felt her chin being lifted. 

&quot;Yumi-chan, I have something special for you&quot; She said and leaned 
forward, &#39;Onee-sama! Are you really going to-Oh! So sudden, but I....&#39; 
she leaned upward puckering her lips, she felt something in her hair 
fiddling, her pigtails-&#39;Even if it is a bug, it&#39;s Onee-sama and she is 
so much more important!&#39; 

&quot;Done!&quot; Yumi opened her eyes and her whole body went red like a steamed 
lobster as she backed up &quot;Is something wrong Yumi-chan? Don&#39;t you like 
it?&quot; She blushed 

&quot;What is it Onee-sama?&quot; Yumi felt her hair and felt a flower. 

&quot;I bought it earlier; guess what sort of flower it is.&quot; Yumi thought 
then shrugged her shoulders &quot;It&#39;s a Rosa Chinesis, you will be taking 
over the title in a bit and I wanted to-&quot; Yumi immediately cut her off 

&quot;I..... Don&#39;t want to talk about that, just not right now...&quot; Yumi said 
looking down &#39;Onee-sama, your not going to be here long... can&#39;t we just 
be happy and pretend that it isn&#39;t going to happen? I don&#39;t want to say 
your going, so why should we speak about it? I just, want to be with you 
right now. Stop talking about it please, it hurts to much. It hurts to 
much.&#39; She thought what she wanted to say, but no words came out. &#39;I 
want to tell you, why can&#39;t I. I&#39;m being such an idiot, why can&#39;t I 
talk... Am I afraid of what you will think, will you call me selfish?&#39; 
Yumi looked up at Sachiko with big eyes, tearing up as she stared at 
her. Sachiko quickly pulled Yumi close and stood strong 

&quot;I understand, don&#39;t worry Yumi-chan.&quot; She rubbed her back and smiled 
lightly holding the fragile girl close. &#39;Onee-sama..... Your so warm, 
don&#39;t let me go.&#39; Sachiko laughed a bit trying to cheer Yumi up, &quot;For 
now we are here together so don&#39;t worry.&quot; It took awhile, before Yumi 
finally pulled back smiling she saw Sachiko reach into her pocket and 
pulled out a handkerchief. 

&quot;Hold still&quot; She was assertive in tone as she then began to wipe Yumi&#39;s 
eyes, watching as the En Bouton blushed deeply, Sachiko couldn&#39;t help, 
but giggle lightly at this. 

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Yumi said looking up at her, but Sachiko just smiled 
it off. 

&quot;Let&#39;s have lunch.&quot; The two girls sat down in the garden of Red Roses 
and smiled peacefully as they ate their lunch in a quiet bliss as if the 
world would stand still like that, however like a knife threw butter the 
bell rang and their paradise shattered for now. Yumi sighed and got up, 
Sachiko&#39;s hand rested on her shoulder 

&quot;Yumi-chan, don&#39;t bring lunch tomorrow. I have another surprise&quot; She 
said and smiled 

&quot;Yes Onee-sama, we should hurry back to class.&quot; The Blue-haired Red Rose 
nodded and took Yumi&#39;s hand lightly again leading her to the music hall. 

&#39;I can&#39;t even concentrate!&#39; She thought and stared at the music book 
intensely trying to pay attention, but all the thoughts ran through her 
head again and again. &#39;What&#39;s her surprise, what will I do about the 
date, how many times will I think these things!? It&#39;s not solving 
anything!&#39; she finally shut her eyes and sighed resting her head on the 
desk &#39;I give up.....&#39; The young girl thought, after three classes of 
these endless questions she couldn&#39;t stand it and just wanted to fall 
down and give in, but she couldn&#39;t just do that! She sat up at once and 
was about to hit her fists against the table when the bell rang. 

&quot;Class is already over?&quot; She mumbled to herself and got up; she was 
still in some sort of dazed state thinking to herself with a 
dumb-founded stare on her. 

&quot;Yumi-san your supposed to help clean up!&quot; A girl with long red hair 
said, but Yumi was off in another world inside her head and was soon out 
into the hall way. All she could think about was Sachiko and everything 
they had gone threw together, all of it rushing in exact order. Until 
finally she saw Sachiko&#39;s form in front of her smiling happily at her. 

&quot;I love you Yumi-chan&quot; she heard Sachiko&#39;s voice say and a flash of her 
appeared. 

&quot;I love you Yumi-chan. I love you Yumi-chan.....&quot; Again and again and 
again. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you love me Yumi-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Onee-sama, you don&#39;t understand.... I love you too, but..... It&#39;s 
different&quot; She said to the illusion of Sachiko she saw in her mind. 

&quot;Can&#39;t you understand Onee-sama? Can&#39;t you tell....?&quot; She said tearing 
up a bit 

&quot;Don&#39;t cry Yumi-chan... I&#39;m right here; just tell me what you want. What 
do you want Yumi-chan..... what do you want?&quot; The pigtailed girl stared 
out as the images of Sachiko surrounded her asking again and again.... 

&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; She screamed out and heard voices, inaudible to her, but 
they seemed surprised. Most of them were crowding around her and staring 
like she was a ranting lunatic and from their point of view she was. 
Head to head, they were all shadows staring right into her, into her 
mind and soul... she felt herself backing away it seemed like she was 
about to fall of a cliff. She couldn&#39;t do anything, her legs couldn&#39;t 
even move, she was ready to break down and start crying and she didn&#39;t 
know why. 

&quot;Yumi-chan...I see you waited for me.&quot; She felt a hand on her shoulder 
and Sachiko stood over her. 

&quot;Is this another illusion?&quot; She asked quietly and all the blue haired 
woman did was smiled and shake her head. 

&quot;Now, I assume everyone else has somewhere to go as do me and Yumi-chan, 
please excuse us&quot; She said and held her arm pulling her along and past 
the crowd of girls. 

&quot;Thank you... Onee-sama&quot; She said quietly to Sachiko. &#39;I think I know 
what I want....&#39; A slight smile formed on her lips, &#39;I want... to be 
with you, Onee-sama&#39;.
