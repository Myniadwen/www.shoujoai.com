<p align="center">Author’s  notes:</p>
<p align="center">Tokyo  University is considered by many to be among the most prestigious  schools in Japan.</p>
<p align="center">The  research involved in writing this chapter made me want to go to  Kyoto. I’ll be taking donations.</p>
<p align="center">The Meiji  restoration was a period in Japan after the policy of <em>Sakoku </em> ended in which  Japan began to modernize itself. It began with the policy known as<em>Kaikoku</em>, which was the  result of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. It started in 1868.</p>

<p>Sachiko  had never been quite sure about the prospect of a “universal  truth.” She believed devoutly in the Father, the Son, and the Holy  Spirit, but even then, she had trouble reconciling their gospel with  the way the world worked.</p>
<p>Regardless  of this, however, there was one absolutely undeniable truth which  Sachiko acknowledged quite faithfully.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things in this world which are very difficult.  Often times they are thankless things, tasks nobody will notice that  you’ve done. Things we take for granted. Things we try not to  consider as we think and plan for the future.</p>
<p>Out of all of these things, however, the most difficult, thankless  task was often simply <em>starting. </em>Flying was easy; taking off  and landing were the tough parts; one might write a novel if they  could simply have an idea worth writing; if one could diet for one  day, they could diet for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Halfway into their remaining hour of road between the <em>Velvet Rose</em>and Kyoto, Sachiko decided that perhaps she ought to <em>start</em>soon. This decision came from nobody’s wisdom at all, but  rather from a queasy little feeling she got after a queasy little  experience she had. A feeling like if she didn’t start soon, she  might never start at all.</p>
<p>She didn’t even bother to ask herself precisely what she was  starting.</p>
<p>She knew.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  feeling of <em>fitting in</em> was a funny little thing for Shimako  Toudo. She wasn’t really quite sure what it was like, but she  thought that she ought to. She sat next in the front seat again, next  to Sei, who drove, and nursed what remained of her hangover, while  talking with Yumi, in the seat just behind her, and Yoshino, sitting  next to Sachiko, who sat next to Yumi. (Yumi had flat refused to  leave Sachiko’s side after the girl had nearly collapsed in the  parking lot outside of <em>Velvet Rose</em>, clutching her stomach and  grimacing.) The three discussed idle, useless things: Music;
<p><em>Yoshino,  who was the band playing at Velvet Rose?<br />
  You  don’t know, Shimako? That’s Beck! They’re amazing.<br />
  But I  thought you said they were only okay.<br />
  I  said they were </em>pretty good, <em>and that’s only because that guy  was totally making a pass at me.<br />
    I  don’t think that’s quite how it was. It looked more like he was  looking at </em>Onee-sama…<br />
  <em>You  only say that because that’s where </em>you <em>were staring the  whole time.</em><br />
  school;<br />
  <em>Yumi,  are you applying for any schools?<br />
    I was  thinking about applying to Tokyo University.<br />
    Are  you serious?<br />
    Why  are you saying it like that?!<br />
    Saying  it like what?<br />
    You  said that in the same tone of voice you might address Rei had she  just announced her intent to marry the Emperor. Or fly.<br />
    I did  not say it like that! Anyway, that was way too specific!<br />
    You  did kinda say it like that, Yoshino…</em><br />
  even  simple things like plans for Kyoto.<br />
  <em>Do  you think Sachiko will be able to handle something like a live house  after she collapsed like that?<br />
    I  think that if she has her mind set on such a thing, it is in all of  our best interests not to attempt to stop her. The rich have better  hired help, and better insurance.<br />
    You  shouldn’t talk like that. I don’t think she likes it.<br />
    I’m…sorry.<br />
    Settle  down, Yumi, she was just kidding. Nobody’s threatening your young. </em></p>
<p>Even  after this, the thing feared most by those who are unlucky enough to  earn the title <em>socially awkward, </em>the <em>gaffe</em>, it wasn’t  so bad. Shimako felt the embarrassment and, worse, the fear begin to  rise from her gut to her chest.</p>
<p>She  looked over at Sei quickly. Sei was gazing out the side window, a  bored look on the side of her face that Shimako could see in the  reflection of the glass.</p>
<p><em>She’s  not looking at me. </em>A moment, barely visible, of childish intent  in the private voice of her mind. And then, more comfortable. <em>She’s  not looking at me. She’s not looking, so nothing’s wrong. She’ll  only turn her attention here if she needs to or if she wants to, and  she doesn’t need to<br />
  (but  she doesn’t want to either)<br />
  so  everything’s fine. Handle yourself, the same as always.<br />
  (because  she won’t)<br />
  Because  she knows I can. And I can.</em></p>
<p>Shimako felt her heart slow and her skin cool. She leaned back, and  felt two things which were fairly easily separable:</p>
<p>The first was a warm feeling; not exactly comfort, but maybe  something like strength, coming up from the same place in her gut the  fear came from.</p>
<p>The second was a brand new sort of fear. Sei was not looking at the  road.</p>
<p>They didn’t crash, but Shimako felt that it was a matter of  coincidence, as the road was utterly empty.</p>
<p>That was the other piece of her life that made her feel as though  this feeling, that <em>fitting in </em>was something strange and alien,  was unwarranted: She knew these people. She knew them well, and in  ways more intimate than she could have known them as a mere observer.</p>
<p>She knew this very well. Observing was something she was very  practiced at, and while it was nice to stave off loneliness, it very  rarely gave one an accurate image of a person. She had known she was  no longer observing when</p>
<p><em>(that)</em></p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p><em>Because I saw it coming. I saw it coming a mile away, and it was  like some inexplicable leash pulled me towards it anyway.</em></p>
<p>She looked over at Sei.</p>
<p>Sei looked back.</p>
<p>She smiled, and Sei gave a grin back, and then went back to looking  at the road.</p>
<p><em>It’ll be fine.</em></p>
<p>So long as Sei continued looking at the road. Shimako was able to  relax a little. (The rest of the car breathed a collective sigh of  relief along with her.) Sei snuck a glance—though this was probably  too romantic a description for a glimpse out of the corner of one’s  eye, Shimako liked it—a moment later.</p>
<p><em>Checking  on me? Is that what this is? I can think of nothing else. </em></p>
<p><em>Sei  has more layers than I thought. </em></p>
<p><em>This  is why observation is worthless. I may as well have been staring  straight into the sun. </em></p>
<p>The  truth was, Shimako had a steady, meticulous mind. She had long been  able to apply it to her studies with great effect, so she had thought  it natural to apply it to the rest of her life. Her life was by its  own virtue untroubled, and until she met Sei, she had not once paused  to think that this was less because of her methodical approach to  life than it was because she was a pretty middle-class Japanese girl  living in Japan attending a private Catholic school while keeping  other people at arm’s length.</p>
<p><em>Getting  beyond observation is hard. Getting to know people is painful. But  thinking about it, the way I went about life was simply…wrong. I  barely even have any memories of my childhood. It’s not amnesia or  anything, I just…didn’t make any. I stayed away from people and  spent my time studying or just watching the world move around me.  It’s a beautiful world, but I thought that just watching it was  enough. What’s the point, though, if I forget about it a week  later? What was the point of the whole thing? The next thing I know,  I’ll be sitting in a desk at University and have no idea how I got  there. A week later I’ll be getting a promotion at my new job and a  month after that I’ll be getting married to somebody I barely know  because it’s what father would want. </em></p>
<p><em>That’s  what this is for, isn’t it. This road trip. It’s not just for  Sachiko. It’s for all of us. We all need it. </em></p>
<p>“Hey,  wake up. I can see Kyoto,” Yumi said.</p>
<p>Shimako  looked up, and she saw it—the first bit of Kyoto, looming over the  horizon in the form of a sign informing her of Kyoto’s population.</p>
<p>“You  can’t see Kyoto,” Yoshino said.</p>
<p>“But  Kyoto can see you,” Shimako said.</p>
<p>Yumi and  Yoshino stared at the girl for a solid minute before erupting into  giggles.</p>
<p>“We  still have half an hour to go before we hit the bulk of the city,  kids, so just settle down,” Sei said.</p>
<p>Shimako  leaned back in her seat as her brain began moving. Like a computer’s  memory, her mind. Address: <em>Just settle down. </em>Instruction:  Fetch. The processor</p>
<p><em>(this is why moving closer is so …</em>damn <em>painful) </em></p>
<p>that was her brain returns:</p>
<p><em>Shimako, just settle down.</em></p>
<p><em>You were in love with me, weren’t you?</em></p>
<p><em>Shimako,  what the hell are you talking about?</em></p>
<p><em>You  were. That’s what I saw. You loved me, and so isn’t this what we  should do?</em></p>
<p><em>Shimako,  I—knock it off.</em></p>
<p><em>I  love you too. I’ve decided that and it took a long time and I love  you.</em></p>
<p><em>Shimako,  I don’t know how the hell I confused you this badly, but—get </em>off<em>me, damn it!</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>Damn  it, I’m sorry. Just…settle down.</em></p>
<p><em>You  keep the people you love at arm’s length. You love Yumi and you  keep her from seeing you by being very affectionate. You loved  Mizuno-sempai and you kept her at arm’s length by acting  independent. </em></p>
<p><em>What  the hell are you talking about? </em></p>
<p><em>This  is…</em></p>
<p><em>What  you </em>observed?</p>
<p><em>…It  is. </em></p>
<p><em>And  you’ve made conjecture based on your observations.</em></p>
<p><em>…Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re  a fool, Shimako. And the only reason I can’t say anything more than  that is that I’ve been a fool all my life, and I don’t believe in  calling the pot black when my mailbox reads </em>kettle.</p>
<p>“Sei,  if it’s all right,” Shimako spoke in a low voice, but not too low  as to draw attention—nothing perked interest like a whisper—“could  we speak later?”</p>
<p>“We  certainly may,” Sei said like it was nothing at all.</p>
<p><em>We  certainly may. </em>Not <em>sure, but why not here?; </em>not <em>yeah,  is everything okay?; </em>just <em>we certainly may. </em></p>
<p>Sei’s  vision was far-reaching.</p>
<p>Shimako  thought she ought to take that down as a note.</p>

Suguru  was the one who finally figured it out, but that didn’t surprise  either of the two who had been asked to accompany him.  He was  clever; it sort of resonated from him. They had been driving along  the highway away from <em>Velvet Rose </em>rather aimlessly, though  neither of them had wanted to admit it to him, it being generally  inadvisable to admit to one’s boss the fact that one hadn’t a  clue what one was doing. <em>(The trick of it is to look busy while  you’re boning the boss’s daughter, ha-ha).</em>
<p>About  ten minutes into the road, they had encountered a sign which informed  them of their close proximity to Kyoto. A moment later Suguru had  said, “They’re going to Kyoto.” He had then instructed the one  who was not driving to use his phone and come up with a list of all  of the live house venues in Kyoto.</p>
<p>“Live  houses, sir?” that one had asked skeptically. He had seen Sachiko  around the house a few times (she <em>did </em>live there, after  all—just not in the parts he tended to be assigned to) and she  seemed like such a proper lady that the idea of her in a live house  conjured in his mind the image of a woman standing in the middle of a  mosh pit with a summer dress on. It seemed ridiculous. “That  doesn’t seem like Miss Ogasawara.”</p>
<p>Suguru  had smiled, and though the man wasn’t allowed to look back at him,  he could hear it in the boy’s voice. “I think it does. She’s  out here to get away, after all; what’s the use in getting away if  you don’t do something unlike yourself?”</p>
<p>“So  you don’t think she was kidnapped?” he thought himself idiotic  the moment he said it—inside his head and coming from the Boss’s  mouth (the old Boss in Kyoto, not the young Boss-to-be sitting in the  back of his car) were the only places, in fact, that it didn’t  sound stupid.</p>
<p>“Even  though he only said it was a possibility, did you really entertain  the idea for more than a minute?”</p>
<p>Truth  was, he had. He had been told to, after all, and working at  somebody’s beck and call kind of established that mindset inside of  somebody without their knowing—after a while, if the Boss said it  was blue, it was blue, regardless of how much light it reflected.</p>
<p>“I…I  guess I did, sir.”</p>
<p>“Well,  I suppose it does tend to leave an impact on somebody when the claim  is made that a beautiful woman has been kidnapped,” Suguru said,  and for some reason, the man felt better. “I can’t blame you.  Now, please, could you check?”</p>
<p>“Of  course, sir. If I can ask, though…”</p>
<p>“Of  course.”</p>
<p>“How  did you know? That she would come out this way in the first place, I  mean. That the girl on the phone wasn’t lying.”</p>
<p>Suguru  chewed on that for a moment. “I suppose…well, I knew Sei wasn’t  lying. She was daring me to come after her, I think.” He laughed.  “That’s Sei. You’d know if you knew her.”</p>
<p>The man  had seen her once, on her way in. Greeted her, even. She had looked  to him like a man-eater, and not the sort that was good for a night.</p>
<p>“But,  I had thought she might head out here in any case. It’s peaceful  out here.”</p>
<p>The man  supposed Suguru simply knew his fiancé better.</p>
<p>He was  very correct.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Ladies  and gentlemen,” Sei said, “I give you Kyoto.”
<p>Kyoto  began with a bridge, oddly enough, and there the resemblances to  Tokyo began. As they neared the city, the two-lane highway turned  into an eight-lane freeway which they eventually had to stop and pay  to continue using. As they rocketed down the tollway at Satou  kilometers per hour, the three of them who were not clutching onto  the nearest steady handholds for dear life—Rei, Sachiko, and, of  course, Sei herself—saw a skyline which looked remarkably like that  of Tokyo: To their left, a skyscraper which towered up amidst a  labyrinth of round-shingled houses, some with a modern twinge and  some with a design more suited to the Meiji era.  To their right,  that labyrinth extended as far as they could see, eclipsed only by  the shadow of a mountain. To their more immediate right, a man  talking into a small speaker stuck in his ear cut them off angrily  with a honk.</p>
<p>Remarkably  like Tokyo. Remarkably like any god-damned big city on the planet.  You couldn’t help but be a little grumpy sometimes when 1.5 million  other people were sandwiched in around you.</p>
<p><em>Remarkably  like Tokyo. I’ll bet there are Catholic girls’ schools here, too,  ones that teach the girls to walk slowly and keep the hem of their  skirts neat. I’ll bet there are families here that tell the girls  that if they’re not polite they’ll bankrupt the company. </em></p>
<p><em>I’ll  bet there are boys here, too. Ones who have bedrooms with latches  that aren’t quite quiet enough to keep the boys from waking up when<br />
  (not  thinking about that)</em><br />
  This  caused Sachiko’s stomach a familiar lurch.</p>
<p><em>You’ll  never get away from Tokyo. You’ll never get away from anything.</em></p>
<p><em>You’ll  never get away from </em>him</p>
<p>“Damn it, Sei!” Rei shouted. “You could drop twenty KPH and  we’d <em>still </em>be speeding!”</p>
<p>“That’s  the point!” Sei shouted back with a touch of giddiness that Yumi  and Yoshino really wished they would have missed. “It means we’ve  got options!”</p>
<p>Secretly,  Sachiko wished that Sei would speed up. Like maybe, if they drove  fast enough, they might more quickly come to a section of the city  that didn’t look like Tokyo.</p>
<p>She  wondered if Suguru had sent anybody after her yet.</p>
<p>“Let’s  get off,” Sachiko said all of a sudden. “Let’s go into the city  and find a small hotel in a quiet part of town.”</p>
<p><em>Maybe  I can buy it and turn it into a house. Then maybe we can all live  there. Just all live there and never have to worry about anything  ever again, just stay there together with Yumi. Not them. Me. They  can stay with their own<br />
  (their  own what?)<br />
  …their  own…<br />
  Lovers.<br />
  (is  that what you are?)<br />
  I  don’t think I could ask for anything more.<br />
  (remarkably  sudden for a girl who can’t make a simple life decision for  herself)<br />
  I  don’t think it’s sudden at all. I think I’ve just not been  paying attention. </em></p>
<p>Sei  grinned a touch wildly and swerved hard onto an exit ramp that they  had damn near passed by the time she got onto it. Everybody in the  car, herself included, shrieked a bit at this. Sachiko found Yumi’s  hand in the confusion and took it, squeezed it. Yumi looked up,  surprised, but then smiled at Sachiko, who could not help but smile  back.</p>
<p><em>(isn’t  it funny that you decide this, that the two of you ought to be  lovers, only now, when your mind is on Suguru and the way you)</em></p>
<p><em>I am  not fucking thinking about that.</em></p>
<p><em>(I’ll  just bet that </em>he<em> is.)</em></p>
<p>Sachiko  gritted her teeth and tried to shut that nasty little voice out of  her head.</p>
<p><em>(I’m  called the voice of reason, sister.)</em></p>
<p>She  actually owned a set of plastic caps for her teeth. She wore it some  nights when her jaw wouldn’t unclench for more than two minutes to  avoid requiring nasty, expensive dental work.</p>
<p>“Lodging,  half a kilometer,” Sei read off of a sign to her right. “Sounds  good.” She took a left turn that was way too hard and sped off down  the medium-sized street.  About halfway down the street, they saw a  large billboard which advertised, using absolutely no flowery  language, that <em>Taku Taku </em>was two kilometers west of the street  they were currently on. Though none of them had a compass on them,  they safely assumed that this meant <em>close. </em></p>
<p><em>(You  better get your caps ready, because I’m not going away until you  acknowledge the fact that you’re marrying him.)</em></p>
<p><em>I  know that. But he’s not even interested in women.</em></p>
<p><em>(Maybe  not, but that doesn’t mean you’re allowed to be. No other women,  and no other men, no matter what </em>he <em>says. Tell me, when do you  suppose was the last time your mother got any?)</em></p>
<p><em>You  are revolting. Get away from me.</em></p>
<p><em>(No,  tell me. When</em></p>
<p>“Onee-sama.”  A gentle squeeze on her hand. Sachiko looked up, and Yumi was smiling  at her. “You don’t need to worry. We’ll have fun.”</p>
<p><em>When  did you turn psychic, Yumi?</em></p>
<p>Sachiko’s  jaw unclenched, and after a moment, relaxed.</p>
<p>“I  look around the car,” Sachiko said quietly to herself, “and I see  not a single person worrying.”</p>
<p>And as  far as she could see, that was the truth. In a moment, her tensions  had eased significantly, so that even looking in the mirror, she saw  a girl with fewer crinkles on the bridge of her nose, and more smile  lines on her face.</p>
<p>Of  course, she had not gotten a good look at Sei or Shimako.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
On a  scale of one to classy, this second hotel was stuck somewhere between  the red-light district of Tokyo and a cave. The experience at Satoi  and Kiyomi’s hotel only compounded this feeling—whereas that  place had had a cozy feeling not unlike that of a freshly-cleaned  house, this place felt a little like a…well, like a cave in the  red-light district of Tokyo. The air was chilly in the lobby—the  result of overenthusiastic air conditioning, no doubt—and smelled  damp and a bit moldy.
<p>“I  suppose,” Sachiko said a moment after they entered, “that the  primary draw of this establishment is its proximity to the live  houses, and not its quality service and friendly staff.”</p>
<p>Indeed,  the only person working behind the counter—a boy who didn’t look  like he could have been out of middle school—seemed to be unable to  decide whether to look bored or gape at the girls.</p>
<p>Sei  said, “At least we know the rooms will be clean.”</p>
<p>“How  do we know that?” Yumi asked.</p>
<p>Rei  caught on. “The rooms can be rented by the hour. I suppose you want  to clean those up if you don’t want to get shut down.”</p>
<p>Yumi  blinked, nonplussed, for about half a second, and then yelped as her  face turned a deep red. From behind the counter, the boy snickered  audibly, and Yoshino shot him a nasty look. The boy stopped  snickering, also with a little yelp.</p>
<p>“Though, if they’re this close to a live house, I’m not sure if  there will be any rooms left,” Rei said, her tone as even as it  might have been were she <em>not </em>talking about sex.</p>
<p>“It’s  not late yet, so they’ll have a few spots,” Sei said, her voice  just as neutral. “If we’d gotten here at 10 I’m sure all of the  rooms would be gone for at least an hour.”</p>
<p>“Can  we <em>not </em>talk about this right here?” Yumi protested, her face  looking as though it might begin to steam, or perhaps be picked by a  wayward beet farmer. “Or, for that matter, anywhere?”</p>
<p><em>(But  why would you say that, Yumi, when the two of us—oh, I see,  Sachiko, you want to rent a room by the hour here.) </em></p>
<p><em>Be  quiet, you vile woman.</em></p>
<p><em>(Oh  my, I thought we were being more honest with ourselves.)</em></p>
<p>“Anyway,”  Sachiko said, “It can’t be too horrible, especially if it’s  only for a<br />
    <em>(couple  of hours)</em><br />
  day  or so.”</p>
<p>“Your  choice,” Sei said with a shrug, and then approached the counter.  Left unsaid in her wake was, <em>just be careful not to get pregnant  off the toilet seat. </em></p>
<p>They  approached with her. The boy looked ecstatic.</p>
<p>“How  many people can a room sleep here?” Sei asked, her tone none too  polite. She probably figured it was best to be forceful with the  youth from the get-go, and this was not such a bad idea.</p>
<p>“Two,”  the boy said. “Three if you like to squeeze.”</p>
<p>Rei  reached out and knocked the boy on the head a bit. “Please be more  careful with your tongue.” The gentle punch was just strong enough  to rock him a bit, certainly not intended to hurt, but he rubbed the  area anyway, his head a bit low. It seemed, maybe, like something he  was used to.</p>
<p>“All  right, then. Three rooms, please.” And then, before the boy could  ask, “For the night.”</p>
<p>“All  right.” The boy seemed to be doing his best to keep the resentment  out of his voice, but at the same time, the boy was no older than  fourteen, and resentment was what fourteen year-old boys did best.  Sachiko thought that Yumi could have told them that; even from the  few stories Yumi told, Yuuki had certainly had his phases, though he  was more grown-up than most boys his age.</p>
<p><em>(Maybe  that’s why Suguru takes such an interest in him. Maybe you ought to  act more like a fourteen year-old boy.)</em></p>
<p>This  time, Sachiko could not even muster the energy to snap back. She felt  tired all of a sudden; she wanted to rest.</p>
<p>The boy  handed the room keys to Rei, who divvied them up using the same pairs  she had last time around—by soeurs—though something about it  niggled against her better judgment. This time, they were not all  adjacent to each other—not surprising, since this hotel, being in  the middle of a city next to a live concert venue, would logically be  fuller than Kiyomi’s had been. As it was, none of them were on the  same floor: Sachiko and Yumi were on the second floor, Rei and  Yoshino on the third, and Sei and Shimako on the fourth.</p>
<p>“Well,  I suppose this is good-bye,” Sei said as they approached the  elevator. She was met with silence, and so, after a moment, she  whirled around to face Yumi, seizing her hand. She bent down on one  knee so as to make eye contact with the girl, and said, her voice  positively waxing dramatic, “Promise me that if I lose my life in  this, the most dangerous, eerie, and moldy of dungeons, that you  shall never forget me, and that you will scrub the mold from your  room in my honor at least once a week.”</p>
<p>Yumi  blinked, completely taken by surprise. Sei planted a kiss on her  hand, and the girl yelped, which Sei considered to be a much better  reaction. Looking up out of the corner of her eye, she could just  barely see the look that Sachiko was giving her—possessive as  always, yes, and angry at Sei’s inappropriateness, as always. But  also…</p>
<p><em>Do I  sense a hint of jealousy, my dear?</em></p>
<p>Sei  regarded that to be a plus. She had never regarded herself to be much  of a matchmaker, and indeed, at the hotel, she had struggled with the  prospect of losing Yumi so <em>permanently, </em>but Sei was a smart  girl. She knew the difference between being defeated and never having  had a chance.</p>
<p>Besides,  whenever Sei looked at Yumi and Sachiko, a small part of her felt  only impatience.</p>
<p>“<em>Rosa  Gigantea, </em>please control yourself in front of my <em>soeur</em>,”  was what Sachiko might have said in such a situation.</p>
<p>Not this  time, though. Sei waited a moment, and then straightened up, glanced  again at Sachiko out of the corner of her eye. The woman remained  silent and stoic, entirely unreadable.</p>
<p><em>What  the hell?</em></p>
<p>What  the hell, indeed.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
For some  reason, Sei made a comparison between the room she entered with the  key the boy had given her and a hot dog: It looked okay, but she had  a feeling that she might not be able to live with herself if she  subjected it to a close, rigorous inspection. Not the venue she might  have chosen for what she knew would come next.
<p><em>Knew</em>,  though, that was a funny little word. Lots of people <em>knew </em>things,  but few of them could—or should—confidently say that they knew  them for certain. After all, what was really certain, anyway? The  past, and about half of the present, maybe.</p>
<p>“May  we talk now, Sei?” Shimako asked.</p>
<p><em>It still feels funny having her call me </em>Sei <em>instead of</em>Onee-sama.</p>
<p>“Sure,”  Sei replied.</p>
<p>Shimako  sat down on the bed. It made a sound which might have sounded to the  casual observer like a <em>creak, </em>but to Sei—perhaps only  because it was on her mind already—it sounded like a <em>squish. </em></p>
<p>After a  moment, Shimako patted the bed next to her. Sei hesitated a moment,  and then sat as well.</p>
<p>There  was silence for a moment—Sei hoped that Shimako was not waiting for  her to say something, because she wasn’t sure what to say.</p>
<p>Shimako  let out a breath, and then leaned back, resting on her open palms.  Sei, her stomach tightening into a knot of anxiety, chanced a look at  the girl’s face, and saw somebody who looked like they were doing  their very best to make peace with themselves. This did nothing for  her anxiety.</p>
<p>After a  moment, Shimako spoke.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry,” she said. “For pushing myself on you like that. It was a  dumb idea, and I deserved what I got.”</p>
<p>Sei felt  that she could not argue with that. <em>After all, she kissed me. When  I was naked, of all times. And not, like, dancing on a pool table  with a broom-naked. Like, changing-naked. And after that, she just  wouldn’t…</em></p>
<p><em>Settle  down.</em></p>
<p><em>It  felt like an ambush. I can’t say I felt </em>violated, <em>if only  because it was Shimako, but if I had, nobody would have faulted me  for it. </em></p>
<p>And  then, that old, tired cliché: <em>Why don’t you tell </em>her<em>that?</em></p>
<p>Sei  looked at Shimako, who looked as though she was trying very hard to  hold her expression. She didn’t feel anger like she had immediately  after Shimako had pressed their lips together, nor frustration as she  had tried to push the girl off and had been met with depression and  something bordering resentment rather than a sudden snap of clarity  as she had been hoping for. In Shimako, she did not see a scared  schoolgirl confessing to her first crush; not now, not then.</p>
<p>She saw  a girl, now, as she had then, who had simply been afraid of losing  her <em>Onee-sama </em>to feelings that she didn’t fully understand,  and certainly had no tools to deal with.</p>
<p><em>I had  still thought she was straight.</em></p>
<p><em>I  think if I’d said that she might have run into the hall crying,  naked or no.</em></p>
<p><em>How  do you even deal with feelings like that? It’s not like there’s  really many people around to talk about it with, doubly so at a  damned </em>Catholic <em>school. One minute, you’re the same as  nine-tenths of the people around you, and the next, you realize that  you’ve caught yourself in the middle of a fantasy about, of all  people, your </em>Onee-sama. <em>I think I might have been scared  assless too. It’s not one of those things you can deny or brush  over, like finding the newscaster pretty or having fun little  thoughts about the girl who sits next to you in class.</em></p>
<p>“It  was scary, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Shimako  nodded. “It was. It was terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Are  you still scared?”</p>
<p>“A  little.”</p>
<p>“Of  me? Or of yourself?”</p>
<p>Shimako  shook her head. “Neither of those things. Or maybe a little of  both.”</p>
<p>Sei  leaned back, placing herself parallel with Shimako, also resting on  her hands. After a second, she thought, <em>fuck it, I think she got  the idea before, </em>and put one of her hands on Shimako’s,  offering a silent prayer of <em>please, don’t let her get the wrong  idea, </em>and hoping she waxed comforting more than she thought she  did.</p>
<p>“<em>Onee-sama?</em>”</p>
<p><em>She’s  calling me that again. It feels kind of nice.</em></p>
<p>“Mmm?”</p>
<p>“Can  we just start over?”</p>
<p>“From  what point?”</p>
<p>Shimako  hesitated, and while Sei didn’t see her clenching one hand tightly  behind her back, she wouldn’t have been surprised, either. “I was  hoping from just before I went after you naked.”</p>
<p>“So  you’re hoping for…”</p>
<p>“I  guess…I…” Shimako shook her head. “I…my feelings haven’t  changed; I don’t think so anyway. But if I try again, I’d like to  try and avoid all the,” her voice changed a bit here, and it took  Sei a moment to realize she was doing an impersonation of none other  than Sei herself, “melodramatic, girly bullshit. I guess…from  before. Start over from before.”</p>
<p>Sei was  dumbstruck for a moment until she caught the impression, <em>(I said  that very same thing to Kei not two weeks ago; Shimako was in the  room, too)</em> and then she smiled.</p>
<p>“Sure,”  she said, and then squeezed Shimako’s hand. “Start over, then.  From before.”</p>
<p>“Do  I…”</p>
<p>“Have  a shot?” Sei gave up leaning, and flopped back onto the bed  completely, pretending she didn’t hear the <em>squish. </em>Or  telling herself that she imagined it. Maybe she did.</p>
<p><em>Does  she?</em></p>
<p>Sei  took a look at Shimako, catching only the girl’s slender back and  neck, her pale skin, and the gentle outline of her left breast. She  thought, <em>Mind out of the gutter and answer her seriously, please. </em></p>
<p>Really,  there was no thinking involved.</p>
<p>Who, in  all the world, understood her better than Shimako? Understood the  need ingrained deep within her to simply <em>live and let live, </em>an  idea that, sometimes, it felt like the rest of Japan couldn’t catch  onto to save their fucking lives.</p>
<p><em>(Yumi)</em></p>
<p><em>(Maybe  Yumi. But Yumi is not interested, and you have to live and let live.  You have to do your best for Yumi to stay out of her way, just as you  always have, interfering only in small doses to give her a nice,  open-palmed, metaphorical pat on the behind.)</em></p>
<p><em>And  how wonderful a thing it is to simply be </em>understood.</p>
<p>“I  think so.”</p>
<p>Shimako  exhaled, and Sei could hear the relief. “Thank you, <em>Onee-sama.</em>”</p>
<p>Sei sat  up again and grinned. “Hey, no problem. Besides, this way, all the  girly bullshit stays in our heads where it belongs.”</p>
<p>Shimako  smiled a little airily, already seeming more herself. She leaned  back, thought a moment, and then said, “Indeed it does.”</p>
