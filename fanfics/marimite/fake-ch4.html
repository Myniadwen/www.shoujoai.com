<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  last chapter, I put forth a joke about “powdering Sachiko’s  nose,” but did not explain it.  It’s rather my own private joke,  I realize, so this was not entirely fair to you.  Perhaps some of you  caught the Pulp Fiction reference, but this wasn’t my intended  interpretation. Rather, the joke was based on my own observations  about life.  Namely, that “powdering one’s nose” is, in fact,  Lady for “taking a shit.”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…Ba-dum-kchhhhh.  Weak payoff, brother. Don’t quit your day job, I know.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now,  on with the show!</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  higher you are / the farther you fall</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The house  that Jack built #1</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  next few moments were a suture for a long-aching burn inside of  Sachiko. Like a weak, arthritic joint or an old scar that never quite  healed right, something in Sachiko had ached, had <em>been </em>aching  since she left Lillian, to the point where sometimes it physically  burned at her, underneath her breast; a powerful, gnawing pain that  would sometimes last for hours on end.  But like that old proverbial  bullet wound, even if it hurt constantly, it only really <em>burned </em>sometimes, on those odd days when it was about to rain, when she  sat on it wrong, when she saw<br />
      <em>a  happy family</em><br />
  something  sticky-sweet on television.  The old hurt never really gave her cause  for thought, nor pause except in her most private moments, when she  might nurse it for a while, but if she had thought on it long and  hard—which she had not—she might have really taken note of it,  rather than accepting it as something that was simply a part of her  life, and as far as she was concerned, always had been. It had become  something so normal to her that when it suddenly vanished in a single  moment of fluttering stomachs and interlocked bodies, she felt as  though the entire world had suddenly stopped leaning on her shoulders  and found some other new sap to roll on for a while.  All of her pain  evaporated, all of her worry and doubt and<br />
  <em>hate</em><br />
  tension,  and she felt her whole body relax, like that old war veteran after a  small operation finally found that old wood splinter that had lodged  itself in his shoulder that he had been calling a bullet from a Nazi  sniper for so long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  the world didn’t seem quite so bleak after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, all at once, she became aware of everybody else’s gaze.  Not  on her, of course.  That would have been hopelessly impolite.  Rather, the entire room, save for that one blank patch where she and  Yumi stood, had become the target of her guests’ interest, and she  and her <em>petite soeur </em>had become that impossible anti-space,  the blank spot in the universe.  It was polite, but it was<br />
      <em>what  the hell do you think you’re doing in front of all of your guests  your expression is piling at your feet in a sludge</em><br />
  agonizing.<br />
  Sachiko’s  family hosted a lot of gatherings for a lot of very rich, important  men, which meant that they also played host to a lot of very young,<br />
  <em>more</em><br />
  beautiful  trophy wives.  Because of the transient nature of that lifestyle,  there was never a shortage of weddings to gossip on and ooh and aah  over, and there was never a shortage of newlyweds—of horny old men,  desperate to sire a child and prove to themselves that they weren’t  really <em>that </em>old, and of beautiful young women who know that  the size of their alimony check would one day be directly related to  the extent that they put out for their husbands.  So there was always  the <em>one </em>couple. The <em>one<br />
    dingy<br />
    at  least Suguru isn’t</em><br />
  old  man who simply could not keep his paws off of his new wife,  especially after the <em>sake </em>had made a few rounds around the  party. And as soon as his control slipped, people simply found other  places to look, quietly thinking, <em>what a disgusting old man</em> and saying what a lovely couple they were, all the while not really  paying attention to what <em>they </em>had been doing at all.  He  became the center of attention in the room, the heretic you were  forbidden to so much as look at.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now,  suddenly, Sachiko felt that man. That dirty old man, unable to keep  his paws off of the pretty women, simply because he thought he had  the money for it. She released her <em>petite soeur </em>immediately,  bringing her out to shoulder’s length so quickly that it was almost  a shove, and smiled as best she could at her.  All at once, light  ceased to slide around her and she became a living, visible, tangible  entity again.  At the same time, Yumi’s open, ear-to-ear smile  faded a little as she saw something she couldn’t quite interpret in  Sachiko’s expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  good to see you, Yumi,” Sachiko said politely, mustering her  strength, smiling, and forcing herself to forget about that old,  dirty<br />
      <em>Not  thinking about that.<br />
      </em><br />
  “It’s  good to see you, <em>onee-sama</em>,” Yumi replied with equal  politeness, and the kind of emptiness in her voice that signified  that she was becoming a true lady.  Sachiko felt that old hurt start  to return again, and familiarity seemed to return to the world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Painful,  agonizing familiarity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Would  you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Painful,  agonizing familiarity, followed by a painful, agonizing silence as  the rest gazed at the two of them, and Sachiko gazed at Yumi, seeing  nothing else for a second.  She didn’t see Rei’s hand tighten on  the hem of Yoshino’s skirt.  She didn’t see Shimako Toudo walk  in, silent and unannounced, and freeze at the door, perhaps out of  panic, or an uncanny sense of atmosphere and moment.  She didn’t  even see Sei, grimacing, the lines of her pretty face flat and  unemotional but her large, normally clear eyes scrunching up into an  expression of disapproval, bordering anger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She saw  none of this. She only saw the emptiness, and perhaps the first  glimmer of a tear in Yumi’s eye, and she wanted to scream in a  thousand different ways, <em>no, that’s not it, please don’t!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  maybe, inside, she did scream a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  something screamed back at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>YOUR  GUESTS ARE STARING AT YOU! </em>It screamed, its voice less that of  her mother now than that of a screeching, swooping harpy.<em> What in  the hell do you think you’re doing, you stupid girl? Your guests  are sitting there uncomfortably and </em>STARING AT YOU! <em>GET BACK  IN THERE AND TALK TO HIM. </em>The last words were so shrill and  painful in her head that Sachiko had to press her head to her temple  to stem off a small tide of pain that erupted there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  the pain traveled elsewhere. Underneath her breast, where it flared  and burned.  She had felt it before, especially in recent months, but  never this intensely—now it felt like a small sunspot had formed in  her chest.  She drew in a hefty breath once, twice, three times, and  forced the pain down, and it almost came back up through her  esophagus. Yumi’s form began to blur out, and she shook her head,  hard. Her guests were <em>really </em>beginning to stare now.  Sei had  left her spot by the wall, and Yumi, all hurt gone from her eyes,  reached out and touched her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>?”  Yumi’s voice was small and a little frightened.  “Are you all  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>OF  COURSE YOU’RE ALL RIGHT YOU STUPID GIRL GET UP RIGHT NOW BEFORE I  HAVE TAKASHI TAKE YOU IN BACK AND SPANK YOU<br />
  THAT  “DIRTY OLD MAN” IS RICH AND POWERFUL AND YOU SHOULD BE GODDAMN  HONORED TO BE BREATHING THE SAME </em>AIR <em>THAT HE IS</em><br />
  The pain  was starting to concentrate.  In her lungs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Get  up?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  was suddenly staring at the hem of Yumi’s dress, rather than her  pretty, expressive face, and Yumi uttered a small shriek, and then  Sei was there, <em>Sei</em> of all people, moving faster than a thin  waif of a girl like her should have ever been able to move.  She  caught Sachiko on the way down and eased her to the ground, and now  Sachiko was staring at the ceiling and fighting to keep her gorge  down, unable to even <em>think </em>about moving coherently as she  fought inside of her to keep what <em>was </em>inside of her from  spilling out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama?</em>”  Yumi’s face appeared in her vision, blocking the ceiling out.  “What’s wrong, Sachiko? What—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door  opened and a male voice said, “Please move aside.  I’ll take care  of this.”  Powerful hands gripped under her armpits, and yanked her  up so that her torso was almost perpendicular to the ground. The pain  spread down to her stomach now, and then there was something poking  at her mouth.  Something hard and powdery, tasting vaguely of chalky  fruit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aspirin,”  Sachiko rasped, astounded at how bad her voice sounded.  “Give me  some aspirin and I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think,” the voice said, “that you’ve had quite enough aspirin  for one month, Miss Ogasawara.”  The voice was formal and  respectful and a little chastising all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>THERE  NOW TAKASHI WILL TAKE YOU OVER HIS KNEE AND</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  eat these. You will feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  wrong with her?” Rei asked, her voice a little strained with panic.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,”  the voice<br />
      <em>(TAKASHI)</em><br />
  said.  “She is simply feeling ill in her stomach. Miss Ogasawara, please  chew these. You will feel much better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody’s  hand pressed at the edges of her teeth, near her molars and her  cheekbones, and Sachiko tried to clamp her mouth tighter.  What were  they doing? Didn’t they know if she opened her mouth, she’d—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  mouth opened and a great, powerful belch slid out of her throat, wet  and painful and relieving all at once.  Stomach acid dabbled at the  back of her palate, and she swallowed it back down.  Her vision  cleared all at once, and her stomach and breast settled enough that  she could move again.  The man behind her stuffed a pair of antacids  into her mouth, a little forcefully, and gently closed her mouth, but  by that point Sachiko didn’t need it.  She bit down and chewed,  once, twice, three times, and then swallowed. The relief was almost  immediate, and all at once she felt inexpressibly better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  moment, Sachiko turned around to face her savior, and somewhere, her  mother laughed at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  her butler, Takashi. Elderly but certainly not old by anybody’s  standards, least of all his own.  She smiled at him as best she  could, and he grinned back warmly.  “You have had quite enough  aspirin this month, Miss Ogasawara,” he repeated. “I believe  perhaps that you should see a doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  took a quick look around—Sei and Yumi were crouched near her, Sei  supporting her head and Yumi stroking her hand, something she only  now began to feel again.  Rei was nowhere to be found, and Shimako  was speaking quietly with Yoshino.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have guests, Takashi,” she said quietly.  “I’m just feeling a  little tired. I don’t believe there’s any cause for—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain  exploded again in her stomach and chest then, as though out of spite,  and <em>then </em>she threw up. She didn’t get a chance to see what  color it was, nor where it landed, because immediately after her  stomach emptied itself, the world around her went dark and all she  could remember after that was the sound of her mother, shrieking and  shouting.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
At  first, Sachiko wasn’t certain if she was in her own home or  somebody else’s.  Her first thought was, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">did I let myself into  somebody’s house and forget to properly announce myself? </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  she opened her eyes and realized it was neither—Sachiko was in a  large, absurdly comfortable white bed, and her guests were seated  around her, blocking her view of an absurdly small window.  In the  other direction there was a wooden door which gave her a pleasant  view of an absurdly clean, white hallway where men and women in white  and blue coats hustled back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked back at her guests, and Yumi’s eyes lit up. Her mind reeled  for a moment before she steadied it.  She felt groggy</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  lady is </em>never <em>groggy. If a lady makes the mistake of  oversleeping, she will be just as pert and prim as if she had been up  and about for several hours already</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">but not  enough to forget herself.  “I’m very sorry,” she said. Jagged  needles thrust themselves into her throat with each word.  “I  didn’t mean to—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,”  someone male and perky said.  “You’re awake, Miss Ogasawara.  That’s wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a rustling sound as the heads of Sei, Rei, Yoshino, and Shimako  turned as one to face her, and Sachiko turned back towards the door  to find a man in a white coat standing there, holding a clipboard and  smiling brightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What—”  more pain, and this time Sachiko began to cough furiously.  She  reached out with one hand for something, anything, to steady herself  with, and somebody took it with their own hand. <em>Yumi.</em> “What  happened to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  walked towards her now, setting his clipboard down on a small table  near Sachiko’s bed.  “You passed out, Miss Ogasawara, and I’d  say with good reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  watched him expectantly, and he looked back at her, as though waiting  for something out of her.  She realized she was missing something,  and a second later, so did he.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” he apologized.  “I sometimes forget that not everybody  had to memorize hospital policy.” He chuckled, and said, “I’ll  have to ask your guests to leave before I discuss—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  guests,” Sachiko rasped, “are my friends, and are privy to any  information that I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor looked at her for a moment, his smile fading.  “I’ll have  to ask you to sign a consent form stating as much, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” Sachiko said.  “Please, continue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor found his smile again, and did.  “You have been wrestling a  fairly nasty peptic ulcer for quite a long time, Miss Ogasawara. It  has made very significant headway eating the lining out of parts of  your stomach.  It’s a small wonder that this hasn’t happened  already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked. <em>An ulcer? Am I that… </em>She opened her mouth to say  something, anything, but Yumi interjected, very impolitely, at that.  “Could <em>onee…</em>could Sachiko have…” she paused, fumbling  a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor turned politely to Yumi.  “Yes?” he <em>politely prompted, </em>and Sachiko bit back a laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  shook her head once and spoke slowly.  “Could it be possible that  Miss Sachiko suffered from too much…” she glanced at Sachiko, who  actually took a moment to realize what it was that Yumi was doing:  She was being a lady.  She was asking if Sachiko was under a lot of  stress without asking.  She was showing her training.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Do  you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  wasn’t sure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stress?”  the doctor asked, and then laughed.  “Maybe that was what brought  that attack on, and I’d have to ask your <em>onee-sama </em>about  that,” he gave Yumi a small, fatherly wink, “but peptic ulcers  are caused by a disease.  It’s easily curable, and the damage  reversible.  It’s a good thing we got to her when we did, though,”  he leveled a stern gaze at Sachiko, the kind that said, <em>if I was  your doctor, I’d have given you a stern talking-to, and then a  helpful kick in the ass for this, </em>“because if she had continued  the way she was going, we may have had some hemorrhaging on our  hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  was no blood in any of her vomit,” Sei offered helpfully, and then  snorted a laugh.  Sachiko looked at her, and saw that she was wearing  a different outfit than the one that she’d come in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor smiled appreciatively.  “Thank you, Sei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  frowned. <em>How did he know her name? </em>This, unfortunately, was a  piece of information that she could only obtain by sharp inquiry,  which meant that she couldn’t <em>gently prompt </em>it out of  anybody.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  going to write you a prescription for an antibacterial and an  antacid,” the doctor said, turning his firm gaze back onto Sachiko.   “And I want you to start eating properly and stop taking so much  aspirin.  If you’re getting chronic headaches, you should see <em>your </em>doctor about that. <em>That </em>little piece I got from your  fiancée, Mister Kashiwagi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  gasped audibly; whether at the latter piece of information or the  former, Sachiko wasn’t sure of, but she got the feeling that it was  very important nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To tell  the truth, though, Sachiko hadn’t really realized that she <em>wasn’t </em>eating properly or that she <em>was </em>going overboard on  aspirin.  She hadn’t noticed any hunger pangs in her stomach—when  her stomach <em>did </em>hurt, she took an antacid and a nap.  By the  time she awoke, she felt better.  She ate…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When </em>do <em>you eat?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She ate.   She must have been eating.  Otherwise she’d be a lot thinner<br />
      <em>you  fat, stupid girl who will want you if you eat</em><br />
  wouldn’t  she?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honestly,  she wasn’t sure.  But if Suguru had noticed it…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  doctor stood up, bowed slightly, and said, “I’m going to go get  your prescription.  I suggest you rest. If you want, I can arrange  for a cab to pick you up here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  occurred to her that she didn’t even know where <em>here </em>was.  She was at some sort of doctor’s office or hospital, and Sei seemed  to know people here, but beyond that the whole thing was sort of a  mystery to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  need,” Sei said.  “I’ll take them home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” the doctor said, and then bowed once more and left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All  heads turned first to Sachiko, who looked immediately at Sei for an  explanation. Sei merely shrugged.  “He’s my doctor.  He...helped  me out not long ago, so when I found out we were coming here, I  called him and asked him to meet us at the ambulance bay.  He’s  very good.”  She sounded like she meant it, but not like she cared.   Not about the doctor, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  definitely looked as though she cared about Sachiko.  Her gaze was as  worried as Sachiko had ever seen it.  Which, to be fair, was not  saying much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  go get the car,” Sei said.  “Rei, Yoshino, Shimako, you can come  help me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  quite possibly the most transparent fabrication in history, but  Sachiko appreciated it nonetheless.  They stood up, each paid a small  sympathy</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sympathy  is one of your primary weapons as a Lady</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and  left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  it was just Sachiko and Yumi again.</span></p>
