<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Warnings  for this chapter: Adult situations and underage drinking. And cussing.  (I totally pulled it off.) Scary, I know. Don’t let it bug you—it’s  everywhere in Japan, as you can buy beer out of vending machines right  on the street.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For those of you who don’t know, Hokkaido Prefecture is home to Sapporo-shi, the city where the famous beer is brewed.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  you’re curious about the Buddhist thing (how they’re generally  encouraged not to drink), you could start by looking up the principles  of Sila. If you are a Buddhist and you feel that I’ve done a poor job  of representing you (I did my research, but I’m not a Buddhist myself,  so naturally, errors are likely), please PM me and I’ll do my best to  fix the error.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The handkerchief thing is normal. Trust me.</span></p>

Sachiko  had heard a lot of rumors about the taste of beer and its close,  long-standing relationship with equine urine, but had only tasted it  once, so long ago that she could hardly remember the taste at all, only  that the custodian who had given it to her had had a rough, hard face  that she had secretly been in love with. The custodian was long dead  now, and she had a feeling that she was the only one who still  remembered that gentle gleam in his eyes underneath his bitter  expression, passing a twelve year old Sachiko his bottle of Sapporo and  telling her to have a seat if that was what she wanted.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She remembered coughing heavily after her first sip. Her second was  more controlled, but she had remembered thinking it tasted like…what?  It was strange, really, how little what she was drinking mattered to  her. They hadn’t really talked at all, since her mother had forbidden  her to do such a thing not a week before. (Her mother was, after all, a  perceptive woman who really did want what was best for her, or so she  claimed to her friends.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He only said one thing to her, really,  and that was what she really remembered about the whole thing. He gave  a gentle little smile after taking the bottle back from her. “Not your  cup of tea, huh,” he had said. “That’s all right. Beer’s not for  everybody, much as everybody would like you to think it is, you know?”  Sachiko had not spoken back to him, and he didn’t seem offended by that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  spite of the fact that he didn’t even really look at her, let alone  touch her, (and she didn’t actually know what she would have done if he  had) it seemed to her very nearly romantic all the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  quit soon after that. She never heard from him again, and the next time  she saw his face, it was in the newspaper as a neutral writing voice  told her about how he had drunkenly driven his car off of a highway  overpass into the face of oncoming traffic and killed four people. That  had been three years later, and she had nearly forgotten him by that  point, but for the rest of the day, she had felt the claws of a  strange, icy depression dig into her ribs and her chest. That was  really the taste she associated with beer—not a taste at all, but those  cold, icy fingers, stabbing at her heart and at her sides.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  knew that if she told any of the girls in the hotel room about it, they  would probably ask her to see a doctor, but for some reason, when Yumi  passed her her first mug of beer and she put it to her lips (after some  hesitation), the first sensation she felt was not the taste, but those  fingers again, creeping up her pants, moving over her panties without  so much as a hesitant stroke, up past her sides and onto her shoulders,  where they rested and shoved her down, bending her back as best they  could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it all right, <em>Onee-sama?</em>” she asked. She put a  hand on Sachiko’s shoulder, whether by coincidence or some bizarre  cosmic design exactly on top of the invisible hands. “If you want, you  don’t have to—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko straightened her back, and as she put her  hand on top of Yumi’s, the icy, chilly hands vanished back into her  past. “I’m fine, Yumi,” she said with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi smiled back  and then was passed her own mug—it had turned out that, buried  underneath that enormous stack of self-toasting alcohol, there had been  a small stack of six mugs to drink out of.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey Sachiko,” Sei said. “What are you doing? You’ve got to toast with us before you’re allowed to kill your liver.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was such an unbelievably stupid gaffe that Sachiko had to stop from  pinching herself on the spot; normally such a social error would be  cause for scolding by either a parent, or, more likely, her manners  coach, so that she almost expected it to happen here, now, in the  middle of a cool, locked hotel room filled with her closest friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead, everybody laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m very sorry,” Sachiko said as sincerely as she could, and Sei winked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about it. If I had Yumi sitting right next to me like that, I’d  be in a rush to do something out my inhibitions, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako said nothing to this, though a fifth grader could have thought of <em>you have inhibitions? </em>as a decent response.  She did not stare at the ground, but she did not look at anybody, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  began filling mugs and passing them around, but when she filled one to  pass to Shimako, she stopped, blinked, and then sighed. Yoshino looked  at her, and then looked back at Shimako, and a second later, her face  lit up in understanding, and she said, “I’ll take that one, Sei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako’s  voice was very small, very delicate. Sei openly gaped, and it seemed to  Sachiko a little funny that the first thing that Sei said to Shimako  after several hours of painfully awkward silence was, “Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako nodded a little timidly, and Yoshino passed her a glass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  right, then?” Sei said. “Everybody got one? Great.” She raised her mug,  and everybody followed suit, even Shimako, who looked up. At first,  Sachiko thought that she would just clink somebody’s glass, being in a  rush to drink, but instead, Sei took a moment, and then smiled. It  wasn’t a grin, as Sachiko was used to from her, but a genuine smile.  She looked at Shimako, who didn’t look away, though she appeared as  though she wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To friends and whatever else we are,” Sei  said, “for all of our highs and deep, deep lows, I wouldn’t drink with  anybody else in a locked hotel room just off of a largely empty  highway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked as Shimako as she said it. When she was finished, she did not drink.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shimako  took a second, and then said, with some difficulty, smiled back. Her  eyes shone with…something. “Cheers,” she whispered, unable or perhaps  unwilling to raise her voice any higher.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei reached across  Yoshino—which involved essentially setting her chest on the girl’s  lap—and clinked her glass with Shimako’s. She straightened up and  clinked with Yoshino, and said, “Well, you heard the lady. Cheers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as that sentiment echoed across the room, Sachiko echoed it right along with the rest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  felt funny at first, and that had nothing to do with the still mildly  nostalgic taste of the beer; she knew this because the funny feeling  started before she drank (the second time): It started when she clinked  her glass, first with Yumi, and then Rei, and echoed along with the  rest of them, “Cheers.” And as she did, her voice neither stood out nor  faded away; rather, it blended in, a unique ingredient in a common dish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A man might have called this <em>being one of the gang, </em>but Sachiko knew very few men. An average girl might have called it <em>being one of the girls, </em>but  Sachiko knew very few average girls; one of them was sitting next to  her working determinedly on her glass of beer, trying to compensate for  the fact that her glass was almost too large for her mouth with the  fact that her tolerance for alcohol was abysmal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It is always  very difficult for somebody who has a very strong sense of self to let  herself be pleasantly lost in a crowd of friends. Because Sachiko’s  thoughts were very often turned inwards, because she always, always <em>watched herself, </em>in  the least vain sense, and because blending in and being absorbed into a  group of friends required one to look at others first; or rather, to  simply not look inwards, being too absorbed with what was happening  around, it was something which was difficult for Sachiko. It required a  great deal of effort, and at first she was not able to keep it up for  very long. Rei started telling a story about when Yoshino was very  young, and Sachiko was not sure when to laugh. (Sei might have advised, <em>laugh when the story is funny.</em> Yoshino might have advised, <em>never, if you want to wake up in one piece.) </em>She  didn’t want to be rude, however, so when Rei told them about Yoshino  tearing down the block wearing nothing but a pair of training  underpants and a smile the size of Honshu, and Yoshino responded by  turning a deep shade of red, Sachiko didn’t laugh even though everybody  else did, not wanting to offend Yoshino, who was clearly becoming angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then something else funny happened: Instead of being angry, Yoshino  fumed for a second or two and then shouted at Rei, smiling. Rei took it  politely and then said something about Yoshino saying the same thing  when screamed at by her mother that time to come in and put some pants  on. Laughter again, and Yoshino drank another mouthful and turned her  nose up at Rei, and Sei remarked, “I know who’s sleeping on the floor  tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And nobody was angry. Nobody had a fit or smashed a  bottle of wine or threatened to bankrupt a company or smacked anybody  else. And Sachiko thought, <em>what if I laugh at the next joke? Will  it make a fool of me? How will I know when the next joke comes? There’s  no hushed pause at the end of a sentence and then awkward laughter from  the teller to inform me that the punch line has just been told. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What if it’s Yumi telling us? I know when she’s telling a joke.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Yumi didn’t tell a story. Rei told another story, and when she told  them about the bunny rabbits and where precisely they went, Sachiko  thought it funny, and so she laughed, and so did everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had laughed in public before. Often when this happened, people noticed;  the most notable instance of this being Yumi’s performance early on in  their</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(relationship? Is that what we call this?)<br />
  (friendship?)<br />
  (what do you call this?)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time, nobody noticed. It was expected. If it was funny, and it was, you laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, <em>almost </em>nobody.  Yumi noticed, and so she slid back so that she was sitting just next to  Sachiko, and took another small mouthful of beer, and then she put her  hand on Sachiko’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It got easier after that. Part of that was the  alcohol; with each mouthful, Sachiko doubted herself less; trusted  herself more than her training. Sometimes, she followed Yumi’s lead,  and sometimes she was able to do it by herself; mostly, she did it by  looking first at Yumi, and then at those around her, and then maybe  forgetting to look inwards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because that was really what blocked  somebody from having a good time with friends, who usually accepted  other friends for whoever they were, rude or not, funny or not:  Self-consciousness. Sachiko was not so multitalented that she was able  to both watch her own behavior and relax at once, and really, Sei might  have told her, that wasn’t the point anyway. They were getting sloshed  (and rather quickly, Rei thought; lightweights, the lot of them—she  didn’t bother to look at Shimako, who was still politely nursing about  half of her first mug); the goal was to not worry about watching their  behavior. That was what they did professionally, Sachiko moreso than  all of them. It was impossible to do that twenty-four hours a day,  seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So what does that mean? </em>Sachiko  thought as they paused and Sei passed refills along—Shimako took a  refill but did not make to drink it; Sachiko and Yumi as well, though  Rei politely declined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I would have thought that was obvious to somebody as bright as you, </em>a voice in her head that sounded remarkably like herself said. <em>It means you’re more than a Lady. You should have known that all along.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That sounds like a bucket of worms to me. A psychiatrist’s nightmare, or maybe his windfall. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hell if it isn’t.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hell if it wasn’t.</span></p>

Sei Satou had always had a fairly good tolerance for alcohol. It wasn’t legendary like Rei’s was, (<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">legendary </span></em>was  a relative term, since it was, in fact, a closely guarded secret of  hers, and she so rarely drank) but she wasn’t such a lightweight as  Yumi, who was working hard on her second mug.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe that was why it surprised her when, halfway into her own  second, she very nearly did not stop herself from moving off of her  perch onto the bed and next to Shimako. It began with the first of many  trips to the bathroom, which was composed entirely of porcelain so  white it made her head hurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she dried her hands on a  handkerchief, she exited the bathroom and started to make her way  across the haphazard circle of upright girls who were all (with two  exceptions) trying very hard to forget for a night how upright they  really were. (She promised herself she would come up with a decent line  to tease them with tomorrow as she stepped over Yumi, taking care not  to knock her nose into her mug.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(Where are you going? She’s that way.)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(She’s that way. She’s not on the bed, so where are you going?)<br />
  But why would I need to do that?<br />
  (If you sit next to her she’ll let you.)<br />
  But why would I need to do that? She’ll forgive me if she wants to.<br />
  (She’ll hug you if you sit next to her.)<br />
  That’s absurd.<br />
  (She’ll kiss you if you sit next to her.)<br />
  You’re an idiot. I’m an idiot. You’re a product of my booze-addled  brain, and I swear to God, I’m never drinking this much again.<br />
  (She’ll touch you if you sit next to her.)<br />
  Booze addled my libido too, that’s great. You’re hitting close to home, buster, and that’s going to just get you hit.<br />
  (She’ll </em>fuck <em>you if)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  caught Shimako’s eye and held it for a full three-quarters of a  second—much as they had during the toast—before Shimako dropped her  gaze, simultaneously dropping something heavy into Sei’s chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s not speaking to you, remember? </em>Sei thought. <em>A little grin at a toast is nothing to throw up banners over, not after…what was it she said? Something like, </em>until you’re willing to speak to me, I can’t speak to you. <em>What did she expect? She can’t poss<br />
  (go to)<br />
  piss off</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yoshino’s  voice, shaky but not slurred, stopped Sei mid-thought, which was  probably for the best. “You know where you’re going, Sei? I hope you  haven’t forgotten your way around the room already.” Laughter, and Sei  smiled easily, a practiced reflex. She wondered what she was  doing—aside from slowing down, nearly to a stop, in the middle of a  crowd of people. It was unlike her to lose herself that quickly; Sei  did her Catholic best not to be an inward person, since <em>inward people </em>tended  to wind up doing stupid things like freezing in the middle of a crowd  of drunken girls to wax angst about a sisters’ tiff that would resolve  itself like basically every other one in the history of the damn  school. She preferred to think of herself as <em>well-grounded </em>and more or less certain of who she was; though, of course, that was just what she thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei, would you please pass a bottle over to this end?” Yumi asked politely, stumbling a little at the word <em>please. </em>“I think <em>Onee-sama </em>would like some more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she sat down, though—next to Yoshino again, much as her body compelled her to do otherwise—she couldn’t help but think, <em>but if you’ve never thought about it, how the hell do you know who you are, you—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko  isn’t even halfway finished with her glass, you lush,” Sei replied with  that wry grin that had taken her so damn long to get back that now she  couldn’t believe she had to force it. “Now, if you’d like some more  beer, I think you ought to ask me politely, Miss Fukuzawa,” she teased.  “Have you found that you’re not quite brave enough to slip out of those  teddy bears?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laughter. It made something inside of Sei move…not  quite with pride, but with something very near it. She loved making  people grin like she did, even if it did make Yumi go red and say, in a  voice that was slightly too loud, “There are no teddy bears!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We all saw them, Yumi,” Yoshino said. “There’s no use hiding it now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  all right, Yumi,” Sachiko said as gently as she could, putting her hand  on Yumi’s. “Teddy bears are nothing to be ashamed of.” She said it so  innocently that Sei could not resist giving a shit-eating grin, not  even for an instant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On her panties?” Sei asked, and at hearing  this, Sachiko did something that nobody had ever seen her do before,  and gasped, jumped slightly, and went a very, very deep shade of red,  and Sei knew she was spot-on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sachiko, you try far too hard to be innocent, </em>she thought, and then, for some reason, found it very nostalgic.<br />
      <em>But can you really criticize, when—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, but this is your last bottle, and then I’m going to change your diaper and put you to bed, Yumi,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re mean,” Yumi grumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you are oh-so-cute,” Sei replied even as she handed Yumi the bottle. “Or are you too grown-up to sleep in my bed tonight?” <em>You’re going too far. Knock it off; that one was right out there, and you’ll—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being inappropriate, <em>Onee-sama</em>,”  Shimako said. Her voice was probably louder than anybody had ever heard  it, and it was thus rather ironic that most everybody in the room was  intoxicated to the point where it didn’t have an impact on them, since  their voices were all louder too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had an impact on Sei, though. Sei most definitely caught it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  probably didn’t have the impact that it should have had—nobody froze  like Sei did, nor did they all look at Shimako like Sei did. Yoshino  was putting back her third mug by this point, and Yumi and Sachiko both  looked fairly well shot (Sachiko’s low tolerance still surprised Sei,  who wasn’t yet over the idea that the absurdly rich did anything other  than drink and have sex with each others’ wives).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko glanced  up, though. Sei saw it, and then remembered that Sachiko Ogasawara was  a better fake than she herself would ever be. She never, ever, ever  completely lost herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m sorry, Shimako, did you want first dibs on Yumi? No, that sounds bitter.<br />
  I had thought that was the idea? Too smart-assed.<br />
  My bad, Sister Toudou? Hell, I might as well just pop her one in the  nose, and then fling myself out a window while I’m at it.<br />
  Hey, don’t let—</em><br />
  “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dead silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn it to hell, why do I get all the attention? Shimako broke rank first.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a second, Sei locked eyes again with Shimako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What is this?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Holy crap,” Yoshino said. “Who had a tape recorder? Anybody? Historic freaking event right in this little hotel room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laughter unwound the tension, and Sei thought, <em>Thank you, Hokkaido Prefecture. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yoshino,” Rei said. “Your language is as coarse as Sei’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, why <em>Sei’s </em>and not something like sandpaper?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The metaphor only works if you use something infamously coarse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laughter again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I don’t think it’s the booze, though.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  think I just have good friends. God Himself couldn’t get them to keep  their noses out of other peoples’ business, but it’s because they’re  concerned, and they know when to back off and when to just…help. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thanks. </em></span></p>

As  drinks more and more quickly turned the girls into drunks, Rei found  herself increasingly having to nanny people—nobody had thrown up yet,  but at the rate they were going, it was really only a matter of time,  and when you were that drunk, it was high time to stop—into putting  mugs down. Laughter became increasingly easy, though never raucous,  which surprised her. She did have to calm Yoshino down a couple of  times, but that wasn’t hard—the girl seemed to relax utterly at a  simple touch, (<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And all it took was a few mugs of beer, </span></em>Rei thought bemusedly. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">All nannies should be so lucky) </span></em>the  last time, going so far as to simply drop her head into Rei’s lap when  she came near. She didn’t move for a minute or two, and Rei realized  that she was asleep.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Really, that was the last straw. She had no real  problem with the idea of the thing; in fact, it seemed to be doing  wonders for Sachiko, who was laughing—and honestly, just behaving—more  freely than Rei had seen her in years. She hated to take that away from  her, but, while Yoshino roused a minute or two after, it still sent a  terrified chill through Rei’s body when she simply dropped like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Not  bothering to wait for a lull in the conversation, which was only about  two-thirds coherent at this point anyway, Rei put on her best  Kendo-instructor voice and shouted, “Okay, everybody, time to pack it  up and get some sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nobody objected. In fact, when Sei  finally looked at Yoshino in Rei’s lap—now more or less roused, but  with eyes which were not entirely focused—she sobered immediately and  stood up, rousing the crowd along with Rei, pinching and nudging when  necessary. “Up, everybody. If your roommate starts to have problems,  come get me or Rei right away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Rei or I,” Shimako corrected,  her voice slurred slightly. She had apparently chosen the un-Buddhist  path along with the rest of them—or perhaps, simply because of the rest  of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, yes, you’re very good at Japanese,” Sei said,  stumbling slightly as she nudged Sachiko and Yumi, both of whom giggled  as Sei bumped into them, out the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you going to be all right yourself, Sei?” Rei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  fine,” Sei said. “It’s my own damned fault for acting like a  twice-damned idiot, drinking like a thrice-damned fool of a schoolgirl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Something  showed on Sei’s face that Rei didn’t like. “Lay off of it, Sei,” Rei  said. “We all made the same mistake. We wanted to have some fun, and I  think we just went a little overboard, or maybe we’re just a bunch of  lightweights.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You didn’t,” Sei pointed out. “You acted like a grownup.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei  shrugged as she helped Yoshino up from the spot on the floor which she  had decided was a comfortable place to slump. “If I had asked you to be  the grownup tonight, do you think you could have been?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei sat down on the bed with some trouble, looking all the more bitter for it. “I doubt it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve done it before,” Rei said. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Come see me if you need help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll be fine,” Sei said. “And I still think sandpaper is a better metaphor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  telling you, you’ve got to use something people can relate to. If it’s  the first thing that pops into your mind, it’s probably a decent  metaphor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Cute. Get your pile of a cousin out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rei left, half-carrying Yoshino. The door shut, the click seeming to echo off of the walls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  next sound Sei heard echo was the sound of a loud, wet burp;  threatening and alarming, both at once. Sei looked at Shimako, who had  found time to curl herself up into a little ball, her face contorted in  fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(go sit next to)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, shit,” Sei said, all at once forgetting that she and her <em>petite soeur </em>weren’t speaking, much less</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(touch)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">touching.  A weird combination of adrenaline and experience kicked in then, moving  her feet one in front of the other instead of both at the same time,  keeping her upright. She moved quickly, picking Shimako up under the  armpits. When Shimako didn’t move, Sei whispered gently, “Come on,  Shimako. I need you to help, or we’re not going to make it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Even  from behind, Shimako looked green. For somebody who had never before so  much as touched a drop of alcohol, this was probably terrifying, so Sei  could understand where the girl was coming from—so to speak—but  nonetheless, the girl started to move her legs, which were wobbly at  best, but supported her weight, if only because she seemed to weigh  next to nothing. <em>This is not going to do right by her body. What the hell were you thinking? </em>Shimako  started to turn her head to look up at Sei, but Sei used her shoulder  to nudge it away. “Keep your mouth pointed down, kiddo,” she said. “If  you choke, then we’re really in it deep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They made it in about  twenty seconds, with about ten to spare. Both spans of time seemed like  an eternity to Sei. Into the white, white, white bathroom, taking care  not to slip out of their slippers, and then Shimako essentially dropped  to her knees in front of the toilet, flipping the lid up almost as an  afterthought. She leaned into the bowl, and Sei knelt down beside her  and gathered her hair up, holding it away from her mouth with one hand.  With the other hand, she rubbed the girl’s back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako’s eyes  were wide with fear. For half a second, she glanced at Sei, off to her  side, and then a vile, horrid retch racked her body, and she contorted,  bent even further, and heaved into the toilet. Her eyes stayed shut  after that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was over in a few minutes. Shimako heaved three  more times, and in between each, Sei flushed the toilet and used her  handkerchief to wipe Shimako’s brow, which was coated in sweat each  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">After that, it was just Shimako breathing hard—panting,  really—and Sei rubbing her back, still holding her hair back, for some  reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Got it all out of there?” Sei asked after a period that could have been a few minutes or more than an hour.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako  nodded, her eyes still squeezed shut, and Sei moved her head out of the  way and shut the lid, and gave the toilet one last mercy flush. After  the water had stopped circulating, she stood up and took Shimako’s hand  and led her out of the bathroom, back into the main room, and sat her  down on the bed, and then stood in front of her. The girl seemed to  have picked up an unhealthy curve to her spine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you feeling better?” Sei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako nodded, looking subdued, not looking at Sei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  sighed, and then sat down next to her, not close enough to touch.  “Shimako, what were you doing? I don’t think I need to tell you this,  but you’re not even really supposed to be drinking. Sila and all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako shook her head. “Nothing is set in stone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How about this, then,” Sei said. “How much do you weigh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako  looked up this time, though not at Sei. She didn’t look troubled, just  confused. She answered honestly, though: “About forty five.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You weigh about as much as my torso,” Sei said, privately wondering how truthful she was being. “How much did you have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t…really know,” Shimako said honestly, her words not slurred, but  certainly moving out of her mouth more slowly even than usual.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Usually,  that’s bad. If this is your first time at it, a small person like you  shouldn’t be drinking more than they can count.” <em>It’s a wonder she didn’t pass out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not that,” Shimako said. “I just…never really paid attention. I didn’t  mean to. Whenever I thought about…it,” at this, Sei took another little  hit in the gut, “I took another sip, and then somewhere along the line,  somebody gave me a refill, and I wasn’t paying attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you didn’t stop because you never dried up.”<em> Yoshino should have known better. I should have known better than to give Yoshino a damn bottle.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei leaned back on the bed, stared at the ceiling. “Do you want me to tell you I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako shook her head. Sei saw it out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That would be dishonest,” Shimako said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, it wouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then it would be too hard to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re a tough girl. I’m the one who’s not tough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That was cold. What the hell is wrong with you? She’s obviously still shaken.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(if i say anything else shell get the)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>right</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(wrong impression)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Please don’t tell me that. It’s not true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Why? I don’t understand it. Why would she just…do that all of a sudden? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(because you’re as blind as a bat)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(blind as a sei the metaphor only works if you pick somebody everyone can apply it to)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You should get some sleep, Shimako. I can sleep on the floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve  got to be sleepy. Somebody else might not have considered it a lot, but  for you, there’s a lot of alcohol sitting around in your body, even  after that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Please don’t talk about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you feeling sick again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Would you come with me if I was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Silence.  Then, Shimako said, “For a minute, I thought I was going to die. I’ve never felt like that before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei felt something blocking her throat. “Me too. I was…scared.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Were you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey  now,” Sei said in spite of herself. “I really was scared. I hadn’t even  seen how damn much beer you had put away. If I’d had any idea that  Yoshino was doing that to you I’d have lopped her off at the ears.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I did it to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did you want to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes. It felt good. I’m not supposed to do it, but it was better than thinking. My father will scold me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you going to tell him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Which part?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shimako looked at Sei, her face clouded. “Which part should I tell him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It certainly wasn’t what she said, but the look on her face broke Sei’s resistance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(don’t you’ll give her the wrong idea)<br />
  You can take your ideas and shove them up your sorry ass.<br />
  (do you really want to let her in)<br />
  Yes. I don’t know why, and I don’t know if I can handle it, but I  overestimated this girl. Maybe I just didn’t know it about her; that  she was like the rest of us, that she had a limit somewhere. She’s a  tough girl, and nobody doesn’t know that. When I walked with her that  day, hand-in-hand, I had thought that she was just sad because I was  leaving, but it wasn’t just that, was it?<br />
  Damn it all, I’m a lousy sister sometimes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei  stood, moved closer to Shimako, and sat again. This time, they did  touch; Sei pulled her in, and Shimako laid down so that her head rested  on Sei’s lap. From above, Sei could see only her profile, all graceful  lines and thick, rich hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>She really is beautiful, isn’t she.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Huh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You were scared too, weren’t you?” Sei began to gently stroke the girl’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes. I didn’t want…it was hard when you left Lillian.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You got by okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know I did, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t hard. I can deal with it.  With distance between us. But with this…I felt like it put up a wall,  and that was worse than all the distance in the world. I don’t know how  well I would be able to deal with that. I don’t think it was very well  at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve never needed me to help you get through things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve never seen how you help me when you do. Neither have Yumi or any of the others. Nobody can do it by themselves, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>She’s  right, you twit. You give her her space because it’s what she seems to  want and what you’re inherently comfortable with, but you can’t lie and  say that that night, when you offered her chocolate and took her hand  instead, that it didn’t feel nice. She cried because she was going to  miss you, and only Yumi and Shiori did that before her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That feels nice, doesn’t it? To know people care about you. Even if you know it, when they show it, it feels nice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Yeah.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shimako,” Sei said, her throat a little tight. “If you want to, you can try again with…you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t feel like it right now,” Shimako said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sei felt something fade in her. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Please don’t misunderstand, <em>Onee-sama,</em>”  Shimako said, and for the first time in what seemed like an eternity,  that old playfulness, so gentle and subtle that you barely knew it was  there, entered her voice. “My mouth still tastes foul and I’m sure my  breath is the same way, and right now, I’d really just like to sleep.  But maybe…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“After I’ve brushed my teeth several times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know if it’s a good idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  also drunk, and I’m not steady on my feet either, though I’ve sobered  since…you know. Maybe that’s the other reason. Let’s wait. For a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sure,” Sei said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>You’re making a mistake, Sei.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Maybe. Maybe not.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>The real mistake was how quickly you said </em>no, <em>though. As though you hadn’t even thought about it. As though it was the only thing you </em>could <em>say.  Being surprised and skeptical at the sudden, unspoken admission about  her sexuality was a shitty, shitty way to justify it to yourself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thank  you,” Shimako murmured, and then, a second later, she dropped off into  sleep, as though she had just been waiting for that. A minute later,  Sei finally felt the tug of the alcohol and exhaustion at her, and then  she was asleep too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This was probably the first time in many  years that either of them went to sleep without brushing their hair or  their teeth, or putting on some sort of nightgown to avoid wrinkling  their clothes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe that was why doing it together for the first time was all the more special.</span></p>

Sachiko  could not help but snort out a giggle when Yumi knocked into the door  she was supposed to be opening and said, much louder than she needed  to, “Where’d that door come from? It popped into me out of nowhere!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was always there, Yumi,” Sachiko said through a giggle. “The way it is,  you’re too stubborn to face how solid it is, is what it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m pretty sure that’s two too many <em>is</em>’s is what that is, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” Yumi said, fumbling the keycard out of her pocket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m quite certain I know how many <em>is</em>’s  are appropriate,” Sachiko said. “I know how much everything is  appropriate for everywhere…ever…here.” She frowned. “Definitely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re always <em>so </em>appropriate, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Yumi agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Well, you didn’t have to be so honest about it, </em>Sachiko thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Always?”  Sachiko said. A moment later, Yumi realized that she was inserting the  keycard upside down into the slot, flipped it, and started trying to  open the door again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Always,” Yumi said. “Like, even when your  insides are spilling out your appropriates you’re outside. No, hold  on.” A click, and Yumi thrust the door open with a bit too much force,  nearly toppled inside. “Darn,” she murmured as she caught herself. “I  think I had too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Is that your first time doing this? No, hold on,” Sachiko echoed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, I’ve drunk before, but I only did it this much once before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was this much, you know?” Yumi stretched her arms out, showing Sachiko  how tall her glass had apparently been—nearly as tall as Yumi herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But <em>when</em>?” Sachiko giggled. Somewhere deep underneath the haze that encompassed most of her brain, she thought, <em>what are you doing? Get hold of yourself, woman, you’re acting like an idiot.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>No, </em>she argued, you’re <em>acting like an idiot. I’m acting like a Sachiko.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>You’re not acting like an Ogasawara. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>But I’m a Sachiko. So that doesn’t make any sense.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh  boy, it must have been…two years ago? Mostly I drink with my brother or  Yoshino, only a can or something.” The door shut behind Sachiko, and  Yumi flopped down on the bed—there was only one of them, <em>because apparently this hotel is all about being that comfortable with whoever you were rooming with. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That doesn’t make any sense.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Neither do you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">To Sachiko, it seemed a compelling argument.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko sat down next to her—until the little corner of the bed gave out on her and she fell with a small <em>thump </em>to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi  snorted heartily, and Sachiko couldn’t help but erupt in giggles with  her. “This is so stupid,” Sachiko said. “If my mother saw me like this  I think she might die.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’d be glad you’re giggling like a stupid,” Yumi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>That’s </em>a stupid,” Sachiko countered. “I’m not acting like a proper Lady. Lay-dee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But you’re more than that,” Yumi said. “You’re a Sachiko, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Somehow, it all seemed so simple. “If only,” Sachiko said, and then, all at once, she began to sniffle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi dropped down beside her and immediately grabbed her around the shoulders.  “<em>Onee-sama</em>? What’s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  have no idea,” Sachiko admitted as tears began to well in her eyes.  “Just that the thought of you saying that makes me very happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Saying <em>what’s the matter?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No. That other thing. About me being a Sachiko.” Tears began to creep their way down Sachiko’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s silly, though,” Yumi said, hugging her tighter.  “What else would you be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A fake,” Sachiko whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And Yumi was being completely, utterly honest. Even through her drunken haze, Sachiko could see that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Being a Lady isn’t easy,” Sachiko said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,”  Yumi agreed, strangely serious in spite of her earlier playful, tipsy  attitude. “It’s not. You should be a Sachiko instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">That seemed, for some reason, impossibly philosophical to Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>I must have been a monk in my past life.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why is that?” Yumi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You said you must have been…um.” Yumi frowned. “Forgot. Hey, you stopped crying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I said that?” <em>I did?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Mmm.” Yumi laid her head down on Sachiko’s shoulder. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why  did you say that, silly.” Yumi snorted again—had she ever been serious?  Had Sachiko just imagined that? She began stroking the girl’s hair,  finding it almost unbelievably soft, though she realized in the little  rational part of her mind that never left her, even after a long round  of drinking, that she was exaggerating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Normally, she probably  wouldn’t have said anything. She might have wanted to, but her pride  would never allow her to say such an honest, dangerous thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">But now…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I said that because I got a beautiful<em> petite sher…s…souer…sour…”</em> Sachiko frowned, stumbling over the word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Soeur</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That. I got a beautiful <em>petite soeur </em>who can defeat everything my stupid, stupid self throws at her without even breaking a sweat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ladies don’t sweat, <em>Onee-sama. </em>You ought to know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  cracked up. For some reason, that was just too much; not simply  giggling, but out-and-out laughter, hearty and honest, in a way that  she couldn’t remember doing before. Yumi joined her, and after a while,  they just dropped to lay down on the floor, facing each other. Since  they hadn’t turned the lights on when they entered, Sachiko couldn’t  see the girl particularly well, though the moon reflected the light off  of the water into their room fairly well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The bed seems like the  more appropriate choice for laying,” Sachiko said, and then stood—with  some difficulty—and dropped down onto the bed. A few seconds later,  Yumi followed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Now, her face was fully illuminated, slack and unconcerned, her eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shall we go to sleep, Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi nodded, not opening her eyes. “Good night, <em>Onee-sama.</em>” A moment later, she opened her eyes. “Pajamas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was in this way that Sachiko saw Yumi fully nude for the second time. Maybe it was the alcohol, or maybe something<br />
      <em>(the mood)</em><br />
  else, but whatever the case, Yumi changed, only  half-turning away, perhaps too tired or too drunk or too something  else, in front of Sachiko, who did not look away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Who couldn’t help but watch Yumi’s slim, pale body shine in the moonlight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Who couldn’t help but feel.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What did I just do?” Sachiko murmured as Yumi crawled back in bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  didn’t change into your own pajamas,” Yumi said. She opened her eyes  then and looked into Sachiko’s, and her own became a little wider.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">With comprehension, maybe. With understanding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">With <em>(agreement).</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Her voice became lower, throatier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your turn,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko  had never undressed in front of somebody before, but that didn’t make  it hard. In fact, nothing was hard now—she did what she wanted first,  without thinking about it, and it was wonderful in that way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  turned herself away from Yumi only half-way as well, not looking at  anything as she changed, quickly, in about the same way as she always  did. Only the confidence of routine kept her from tripping over her  nightgown as she put it on. She tried not to think about it. Tried hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(the way the moonlight played over her collarbone will it do that for me)<br />
  (I looked at her breasts is that where her eyes are is she even looking)<br />
  (what is she thinking)<br />
  (is she asleep)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re…very beautiful, <em>Onee-sama.</em>”  Yumi’s voice seemed to come out of the dark itself, if only because  Sachiko did not look at her. She could not remember precisely in what  state of dress she was in when the girl said it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe it was when she was fully clothed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe that made it all the sweeter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe it was when she was fully naked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe that made it all the more lustful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko sat down on the bed next to Yumi, who sat up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re very beautiful, Yumi,” Sachiko echoed. She did that often, and she realized this now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And really, there was one important thing you did with beautiful girls, right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Yeah. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Who  started moving first was unclear. Maybe both of them had the same  thought at the same time. It wouldn’t have been the first instance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko’s  hand came up and touched Yumi’s cheek. Yumi’s hand touched the side of  Sachiko’s neck, her palm touching her collarbone, stroking with her  thumb. It felt<br />
      <em>(she did see)</em><br />
  nice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yumi’s breath felt hot on Sachiko’s face.  It smelled of alcohol and nerves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko wondered what her own breath smelled of.  It must have been identical.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(this can’t be proper)<br />
  (can’t be right)<br />
  (can’t be anything)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">At one time, that thought alone would have pervaded Sachiko, stopped her before she had even started.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Now,  it didn’t even slow her. She was drunk, and it seemed like her  inhibitions (and very possibly her common sense) were a distant memory,  an annoying fly at her ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The first thing that Sachiko found was that Yumi’s lips were very soft.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  second thing that she found was that Yumi was nowhere near as shy as  she seemed. Yumi’s other arm curled around Sachiko’s head, her hand on  her hair, drew her near, so that their bodies touched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>(what am I doing)<br />
  (kissing your </em>petite soeur<em>)<br />
    (why)<br />
    (because you love her)<br />
    (not like that I don’t. I can’t. I’m to be married to Suguru I can’t do this this is not right at all)<br />
    (then what are you doing)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko didn’t stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  parted after a time. Yumi looked Sachiko in the eye. Sachiko saw  something like fear, and she smiled and stroked the girl’s face, and  then lay down. Yumi lay down next to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What now?” Yumi whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sachiko drew her close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sleep,” she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I love you,” Yumi whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  I,” Sachiko returned. It seemed like the simplest thing in the world  just then. “Love you. We can sort this out tomorrow morning.” That she  was drunk then never occurred to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">As it was, though, alcohol was a cruel master, with its hand in everything from memory to behavior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nothing was ever that simple.</span></p>
