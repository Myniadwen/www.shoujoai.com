<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  familiar with Japan’s tollway system may find several errors in the  early parts of this story. I hope you’ll forgive me.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  reading this, read White Reflection, one of my other shorts. Find a  link in my profile if you’re having trouble locating it.  This  story follows WR’s canon, and there’s a direct reference to the  events in this story within the text of that story. I’ll explain it  briefly at the end, since fanon is never the most memorable of  things.   That means no skipping ahead and cheating.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This story  will take place in several parts. Probably no more than four, but  unlike WR or 2x4, it’s a multifaceted thing. I’m posting part of  it early because I’m a bastard like that. If Sei’s plight seems  unlikely, please bear with me. All will be explained in time, but  only after you’ve had time to ponder it a while.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The name  of the Barre and Grille in the story is a contraction and my own  little play on words. Fleshed out, it’s <em>Asa wa konai, </em>  Japanese for <em>morning doesn’t come. </em>I think the real humor  to it is that it’s something you’d be likely to see <em>in </em>America, where such an idiotic play might be feasible.  Maybe<em> that’s </em>why it calls itself an American Grille.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This is the first of three or so parts. I think.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This story  was inspired by a Japanese song of the same name (only, you know, in  Japanese).  Whoever figures it out gets a cookie. (Hint: Study your  anime)</span></p>

<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  Satou wore her hair down, and she played her music as loud as she  damn well pleased. A regular rebel, by the Lillian's standards--that was how they all saw her, after all: A  bare-footed, unshaven, easy-loving free spirit.  She was none of  those things, of course, but she knew she probably couldn’t  convince them of it, even were she to show them her calves,  clean-shaven, with her freshly polished shoes just below—because  she <em>did </em>shave, and often, inconvenient as it was. She still  attended Lillian University, and so the hem of her skirt was still  tidy, and she still walked slowly, even when she was sprinting to  make class on time.  Her roommate (who had firsthand experience with  Sei’s slender, hairless legs) asked her why she bothered shaving  when there were no men around, and she never seemed to go out to meet  them—she always smiled and told the pretty, clueless girl that she  enjoyed the atmosphere around the school, and liked looking her best.   The pretty, clueless girl never got it, only received it with a  vacant look, smiled, and went back to her own work.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  Satou also drove fast—very fast, in fact. Most of the time, it was  because she enjoyed it. This time, it was because she was very late,  and very scared. She was not frightened because she was late, though  she had every right to be.  Rather, she was frightened because she  had agreed to go at all. She would never admit it to herself—never  acknowledge that dry little twist of her stomach, never let her hands  clench themselves into fists the way they wanted to every time she  thought about it.  She denied these things, and yet she was still  afraid, because such was the nature of fear. Nobody could deny it, no  matter how hard they tried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As the  needle on her speedometer nudged its way up past the little <em>90 </em>mark, she decided it was probably high time to slow down a little  bit, especially since she’d be off the tollway soon—taking a  tollway to get halfway across town, now <em>that </em>was proof of fear  if ever it existed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  not just stand the whole deal up? </em>This thought had occurred to  her many times since she had started the car. <em>Stay on the tollway  until you get to Nagoya, pick Yumi up, and go have a decent night  with the money you’ve saved to torture yourself with for the next  four hours.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell am I doing?  This isn’t me. This isn’t anybody even  remotely like me.  Was I </em>drunk? <em>Am I now?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  pretty sure she hadn’t been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  didn’t change the fact that what she was doing was royally stupid.  Maybe tomorrow morning, after trying to sleep off the biggest  hangover of her life or anybody else’s, she’d be able to say, <em>at  least now they’ll get off my ass about it, </em>or <em>I guess I </em>was <em>drunk, </em>or maybe even <em>I guess that proves </em>that <em>for  certain. </em>She doubted it, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  trouble of the matter was that Sei Satou knew next to nothing about  men. The one<br />
      <em>other</em><br />
  man  with whom she was acquainted in any way was Suguru Kashiwagi, which  did nothing to color her perspective of “the other half” rosily.  She didn’t really care to know much about them, either. She knew  she didn’t like them in <em>that way, </em>and she had <em>thought </em>she  knew how to deal with them well enough that they’d leave her the  hell alone at bars, (at the ripe old age of twenty, Sei was not  precisely a barfly, but she <em>had </em>sampled the local cuisine,  several times) but apparently she was not entirely correct about  this, because here she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then  again, that wasn’t right, either.  It wasn’t men she didn’t  know how to deal with. It was those women. The ones who called her a<em> tree-hugging jungle-legged hippie, </em>among other things, behind her  back—<em>they </em>were the ones she didn’t know how to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s  not true. You know women like Kashiwagi knows men. </em>She smiled at  that thought. <em>That’s gotta be how it is. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  then, </em>she thought, a bit more morosely, <em>how </em>did <em>you  wind up here? Were you tricked? You may just have been, but it didn’t  seem like a trick at the time. </em>She thought that maybe that was  the best sort of trick—the kind that didn’t seem like a trick at  all.  She had never been particularly skilled at guile herself—she  was able to fool Yumi, but everybody was able to fool Yumi. Yumi was  gullible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  thought of Yumi buoyed her spirits a little bit. <em>It won’t be so  bad, anyway. If you can skip the restaurant entirely, go straight to  the restaurant, you can get yourself shat against the wall in an  hour, tops. You can talk to a guy for that long.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  song on the radio changed—she barely noticed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  after that, all you have to do is make sure you don’t wind up in  his bed with your freshly-shaven legs open wider’n Sister Geyer’s  gut.  That shouldn’t be too hard. Right? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah,  not too hard at all. As long as he doesn’t fuck with your drink.  Just watch your drink, Sei. Just your drink.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Watch  your legs, too. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  his hands. Watch his hands. Don’t Guys have wandering hands?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell are you doing?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell </em>am <em>I doing?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody  was honking at her, and Sei was brought abruptly back to reality as  she realized that she was taking up two lanes in her tiny little  Volkswagen Beetle. She swerved abruptly, a reflexive action—and  nearly into a car riding parallel to her.  Only the other driver’s  quick reflexes saved them both a hell of a way to end an evening.  The driver, a young, drab-looking woman, leaned into her horn and  rested there for a bit, her face the very picture of young, drab  outrage.  Sei smiled as best she could, waved perkily, trying to  figure out how best to pantomime <em>sorry. </em>She was still  thinking on it when the other car pulled ahead of her. It vanished  into all of the scenery which never made it past Sei’s eyes a few  seconds later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The song  changed again. What played now was more upbeat, faster in tempo and  heavier on the guitar.  Sei forced herself to smile, and turned the  volume up, thinking that perhaps it would be the last thing she might  enjoy all night and determined to enjoy it.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei had  originally been determined to wear precisely what she always wore  outside of school property: Jeans and a button-up shirt. She had  thought she could do it, too, but at the last moment she had cracked  and put a skirt on, her stomach doing the loop-de-loop as she did.  Not with nerves, not precisely, but with an odd sort of tension. <em>Goddamnit, what do you think you’re doing? You take that off and  put on a pair of sweatpants right now, young lady! </em>She hadn’t,  of course, in spite of the butterflies and the mental talking-down.  She had put on makeup, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What’s  the point if you’re not going to make it look like you made an  honest effort? </em>She had tried to rationalize it as she did. <em>Nobody’s going to get off your back if you show up wearing  sweatpants, frumpy glasses, and drink straight whiskey for the entire  night. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it  was more than that, and she knew it: She didn’t want to look bad.  Even if it was a complete act, even if the whole thing was just a  thing to be gossiped on the next day so that her life could ease up a  bit. Even if she barely remembered his name, and couldn’t care less  what he thought of her before, during, or after. Even if.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Even </em>if<em>, you still can’t escape what Lillian gave you. </em>She  couldn’t decide if what Lillian had given her was a sense of pride  or a funny little voice in her head which occasionally nagged at her  to straighten her back and slow down as she walked, but neither could  she make it go away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  besides, </em>she thought, <em>you’re going </em>out. <em>How long has  it been? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  realized with a certain despair that she couldn’t answer her own  question. Her mind automatically switched the subject, a sort of  self-defense mechanism she’d always possessed. <em>Besides, what if  there’s some pretty young woman in there just </em>begging <em>to be  rescued from a plight similar to my own? Never heard of a knight in  shining sweatpants, have you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  will do no such thing. Who’s going to get off your back about it </em>then?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  very thought—<em>do it right, or nobody will get off your back—</em>had  occurred to her no less than twelve times in the past twenty minutes;  an iron-clad rebuttal to her every attempt to escape what she was  doing.  What she’d forced herself to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time, though, something new came to mind:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  do you </em>need <em>them off your back? Why do you need to defend  yourself to them?</em> <em>Hide yourself from them?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because  they are many, and you are one, and they are everywhere. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck  them, then. I can go on without them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  not going on without them that is problematic. It’s going on, so  long as they’re still around. They are many, and you are one, Sei.  You’re defenseless if it comes down to it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  are they going to do to me? The hell </em>can <em>they do to </em>me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  sort of naïveté had never suited Sei Satou. She knew  it—as idealistic and pretty as it was to pretend that nobody could  faze you, no one could touch you who you didn’t want to touch you,  it was only that—idealism.  The sort of thing that had no place in  real life. Sei wasn’t a hermit. Sei wasn’t a misanthrope. Sei was  not a sociopath, nor was she invulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei was  just a person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei was  just a person, and Lillian University, the <em>same fucking school </em>which she had come up in all her life, was all of a sudden  kicking her posterior, but good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kei’s  gone now, so that’s really it.  It’s just you, Sei, you and the  world, and the world’s winning by a landslide. So for now…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>For  now, you need to focus on your driving.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  the second time in less than half an hour, Sei narrowly avoided an  accident.  Or rather, the driver in front of her narrowly avoided an  accident.  Sei did nothing to help.  She slammed on the brakes  approximately one second too late to avoid rear-ending the person  waiting at the stoplight ahead, and the person slammed on the gas  pedal (<em>stop </em>was just barely done fading out) and his horn  simultaneously.  Sei didn’t bother to wave this time.  She was  thinking about where she was going now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She knew  where the restaurant was; the last time she had <em>gone out, </em>(though  she couldn’t quite remember when)she had gone there.  It  was attached to the bar where she had met him, after all.  He had  given her his number, and she had not discarded it—she wasn’t  quite sure why. Maybe for just such a reason as this. The thought of  herself gifted with that sort of foresight made her want to laugh a  little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  thought that maybe it was the last time she’d laugh that night, so  she allowed herself the luxury of a chuckle.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tokyo  was not a quiet city by anybody’s standards, but tonight it seemed  to be full to bursting—as though if one more person entered the  city’s bounds, it might just explode, pop like a bubble at the end  of a children’s toy. It was odd, since the tollway had been nearly  deserted—probably the only reason she and her car had made it to  the only parking spot left in a mile’s radius in one piece—she  supposed it was probably because everybody had already <em>gone out, </em>and they were now <em>out. </em>She wasn’t late—not by much,  anyway.  She simply kept odd hours.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  date at ten at night. Shouldn’t I be drunk already?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head at the thought. <em>Not a date. An escape. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides.  Maybe she’d be lucky. Maybe he’d be really nice. Maybe he’d  look at her face and magically understand her plight, and smile and  buy her a drink, and then go home half an hour later and tell lie to  all his guy friends about how he’d boned her so hard she’d begged  for mercy and more, all at once.  His guy friends who would then  spread this to their girl friends, but never to Lillian’s faculty,  and then she’d be…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  be munching on her golden gilded hat was what she’d be doing,  because it would never happen—Sei thought that probably there  wasn’t that much luck in the entire world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  three blocks between she and the passed far too quickly for her  liking. Even if it <em>was </em>cold</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>in  your skirt with your shaved legs and shaved something else why did  you shave </em>that</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">outside.   She’d rather have walked for the rest of the night.  She’d  rather have done <em>anything </em>for the night.  She didn’t want to  do this.  She didn’t want to do this. <em>I don’t want to do this.   I don’t want to goddamn do this what the </em>hell <em>am I doing  here just get back in your car and pull out of your overpriced  parking spot and get the hell out of here.  This is wrong. This is  stupid, and it’s wrong and it’s not goddamn you.  You have </em>never <em>been this much of a weakling before get a hold of yourself and get  back in the car.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  yet, still, her legs moved. One after the other, slowly and  gracefully, in spite of the goosebumps running up her otherwise  smooth thighs and in spite of the hole in her gut which refused to do  anything but chew at her stomach, her legs moved. She supposed that  hole in her gut was something a little like shame.  She wasn’t  surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, there it was.  Asawakina, American-style Bar and Grill. The  place was decent, she remembered—it served teriyaki burgers that  were nothing to spit at, even though she wasn’t quite certain that  there <em>were </em>Teriyaki burgers in America.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And,  if nothing else, it has booze. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was that, too. She wondered briefly how she was planning on getting  home for the night, and realized that it was quite a problem, in  fact—she’d brought money for a hotel, hoping she’d be too  plastered to even think about driving, and she knew of several  hotels, sketchy though they were, in walking distance.  The problem  was, what did she tell <em>him? Sorry, I’m going home now, no, to a  hotel down the street. What? You say you want to come with? No, I’m  actually </em>driving home<em>, though I can’t quite remember which  end of the key goes in where, so don’t worry about me, I’ll be  just fine. Just fine indeed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei?” the strong male voice came from behind her—she didn’t  notice the note of uncertainty in it, probably on account of her  own—but it may as well have come out of nowhere.  She jerked and  clamped her mouth shut reflexively to keep herself from screeching in  alarm, and turned around as quickly as she could, her skirt whirling  underneath her a bit like a parasol as she did.  Her stomach lurched  in anxiety as she came to a stop, now facing the mildly stout,  not-unattractive (she supposed) man who had to have been in his  mid-twenties.  This was it. No turning back now; she was in for <em>all </em>the marbles, whatever they may be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!”  she forced a smile onto her face much in the same way a plumber might  force a stubborn nut into place. “Hey there…” her mind began  working furiously. <em>His name began with a K syllable.  Ka.  Ki. Ke.   Kenichi? </em>“Kenji.” She was taking one plunge already. Another  couldn’t hurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  smiled at her, his face relaxing as he did. “Kunikida,” he said a  little wryly. She tried not to make it obvious that she didn’t give  a shit—or maybe she did, but not in the way he’d like her to.  Instead, she smiled. “You got it wrong when you called me too, but  I didn’t say anything because I was afraid you’d hang up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  right. Sorry,” she said, and then realized she didn’t know what  to say next.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently,  he didn’t either. After a moment of terse silence, though, he  laughed.  It was big and expressive, and she found herself relaxing a  little in spite of herself—a good laugh did that to her. Maybe that  was why she had liked Yumi so much, a couple million years ago.  “Damn,” he said, his face working its way into a big grin that  matched his laugh.  “And here I was, making plans for my smooth  entrance and everything. You’re killing me here, Sei. Really  killing me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled back, this time more genuine. “Sorry,” she repeated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“’S  all right,” he said. “Want to know what’s on the menu tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she admitted, and he laughed again.  She found herself relaxing  more—he reminded her a little of her father, before all of the shit  had hit the fan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  but seriously,” he said. “I’m freezing, and I imagine you can’t  much feel your legs anymore,” he indicated her skirt. She nodded  appreciatively, and he made what he would later call his first of two  gaffes of the evening when excusing himself to his guy friends—he  put his arm around her shoulder—protectively, he would proclaim,  his voice dripping with false affront, because she looked <em>colder’n  a witch’s tit</em>.  After that, he would say, she just sort of  froze up, and before they’d even had a chance to order some  imported beer, she was gone.  They would believe him, and they would  pass what he had said on to their girl friends, with the added note  that Kunikuda was kind of a pushy bastard sometimes.  He would bear  this criticism, which he feared was far truer than he’d admit  easily, because, frankly, he liked the girl. He liked Sei, even if he  had no shot at it, because she didn’t even play for his team,  something he suspected even as he settled his meaty, oft-welcomed arm  about the light-haired girl’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But all  of that was still in the future.  Not far in the future, but in the  future.  For now, there was only what there was—Kunikuda, walking  towards the entrance with Sei on his arm, actually fairly grateful  for (if extremely, unbearably uncomfortable with) the warmth it  provided.</span></p>
