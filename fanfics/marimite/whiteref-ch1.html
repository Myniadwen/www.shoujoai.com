<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inspired  by a song by the same name, by Two-mix.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This isn’t  really a bonus chapter for Fake—in fact, it doesn’t really have  much to do with Fake, other than that it follows the canon I set  forth in that story, with regards to character and events.  It  shouldn’t make much of a difference, though, if you haven’t read  it.  Call it my penance to all of Fake’s wonderful constant readers  for not updating in a long time. This is actually because of my new  SR fic, and my subsequent Mai-HiME writing marathon.  And, you know,  school eating my life.  I wrote this in a couple hours I took off  from writing HiME, because the idea wouldn’t get out of my head,  (you know how fast things like that come out) but I’m glad I did. I  hope you will be too. I promise, more Fake soon. Promise promise.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Words in  italic parenthesis are essentially things that Sachiko has scribbled  in the margins of the notebook she wrote this in. Not precisely  author’s notes, nor things she maybe didn’t think were important  enough to include in the narrative, but things that mattered to her  all the same.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I use  honorifics in this fiction because they become important towards the  end. Remember, the most important honorific in Japanese is the  absence thereof—it denotes an extreme closeness.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also,  remember that in Japanese, “San” is two syllables. That's not a mistake on my part, honest.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two final  notes:  Firstly, The Japan Times <em>is </em>a real publisher in Japan.  Not a newspaper, but a publisher of books.  I didn’t just make it  up because I’m uncreative.  Honest.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Throwing  off the sadness and the pain / in my heart I spread / these wings of  courage you’ve given me</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody  once told me that true courage comes from trusting others.  From  letting your guard down and allowing somebody to fill that void in  your heart that all of us have, in spite of the fact that by doing  this, you allow somebody access to your most important part.  While  they’re in there, they can do anything to you: They can cradle you  tenderly, yes, make you feel loved and warm and whole for a while;  but they can do horrible, horrible things to you, too. I think most  of us have far too much experience with the latter and nowhere near  enough of the former. I’m sure some people would use that to try  and prove that life is, in fact, pain, but I don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think  it means that life is dangerous.  That’s why it takes such true  bravery to open yourself to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I used  to be afraid of life. I used to keep myself closed off from the  world, in a safe capsule that most people would call <em>high society.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My first  book was published recently. I think that proves that I can write  decently well, but I don’t want to write things I don’t care  about. Fiction isn’t my strong point, I think, because I don’t  like the thought of burying myself in a story again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I  write things that are true to <em>my </em>life. That makes them not  fiction, or at least I think so.  You can find my work in the fiction  aisle of a bookstore, yes, but you’ll find <em>me </em>in that book.  Not some character.  Me. I write about my stories, and about the  stories of my friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think,  then, that in light of my recent demi-success as a writer, that this  story merits telling. Everybody has a <em>loss of chastity </em>(most  people call it virginity, because virginity is an unpleasant term,  which makes its loss something to celebrate—my family called it <em>chastity, </em>because it was something to be cherished) story, and  I think a lot of them are interesting.  Hopefully I’ll collect  more. I’d love to write about Sei’s, but I don’t think even  Japan Times publishes things that far “out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  told me that was a joke when she read that. She laughed at it, too,  so I suppose it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  isn’t, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think  this is a story that merits telling.  Or at least, merits writing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  that’s what I’ll do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ll  tell you about the snow.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
We were  in the middle of our walk when the snow first hit us.  Hesitantly at  first, it fluttered to the ground spaced wide, coming to rest where  they’d be noticed:  The grass beside us, the dark brown trunks of  the trees ahead of us, and most notably, (to me anyway) on Yumi’s  nose.  She didn’t notice it at first, and I didn’t point it out  to her.  Something about it was…attractive. Not in a sexual way,  but in a way that was sort of endearing, as you might think of a  close friend as endearing when she made you giggle.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  didn’t make me <em>giggle, </em>precisely.  I don’t think I know  how to <em>giggle</em>, precisely.  It’s always seemed to me to  be…lacking in class.  That’s not the right word. Tasteless. <em>I </em>didn’t really have class anymore, not since I started living in  what, compared to my old dwelling, amounted to little more than a  shack with a fireplace.  Writing doesn’t really pay for much more  than that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What it  did make me do was smile. Yumi says that’s a fairly rare thing on  me, so she noticed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, <em>Onee-sama?</em>” <em>(It’s been almost a year and a half  now, and I only just broke her of that habit.  Considering how hard I  worked to force that habit into her, I suppose that’s a good thing,  but I don’t really think it’s appropriate anymore.  I suppose it  was then.) </em>Yumi asked, eyeing my grin with one of her own growing  on her face.  I tried to look away and squelch the thing, but that  image of the little snowflake resting on Yumi’s nose, the only  thing I could think of that could be paler than her delicate skin,  was too much for me to do so immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  caught me looking at her nose, and realized that she probably had  something on it—she assumed, I’m sure, that it was something like  a clump of makeup, and so tried to glimpse it herself, crossing her  eyes intently, determined to get a look at it before she brushed it  away. It was a very ladylike thing to do, on principle—to always  look before you leap, so to speak—but on Yumi, it only added to the  endearing <em>(I daresay it was even </em>cute<em>, though I don’t  think I can write that in a story without wanting to erase it) </em>expression on her face.  As she concentrated even harder, her  mouth thinned down to a small line, and her tongue began to poke out  just slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was  too much for me. I began to laugh, raising my hand to my mouth as  quickly as I could to cover my teeth. She almost looked like a child  when she did things like that, but that didn’t bother me—Yumi’s  face was the thing about her I loved the most.  It was the polar  opposite of mine in many ways—of me, really, not merely my  face—open and expressive, <em>(and pretty, yes. So very pretty) </em>it  seemed as though it was impossible to hide anything on Yumi’s face.  Or maybe it was just that Yumi wasn’t afraid to hide anything from  her face. <em>(I suppose that’s the habit that </em>she’s <em>been  trying to break </em>me <em>of.)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama</em>!”  Yumi protested, finally brushing her nose off and wiping the  now-melted snowflake away. I struggled to rein in my mirth, for fear  of her almighty wrath, and put my hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry, Yumi-san,” I said as best I could, forcing the corners of my  lips back into a set line as best I could.  It was hard.  “That was  just…,” the image of her squinting crosseyed at her nose, her  face done up in concentration and her tongue just barely sticking out  of the corner of her mouth flashed back in front of my eyes, clear as  day, and I began to laugh again.  It wasn’t loud, nor was it  exuberant, but it was a laugh, and it seemed that in the years  following what happened to me the summer after I graduated,  (overcoming a nasty peptic ulcer being not the least of them—that  took more doing than the doctor had me expecting at first) they were  so rare that it still seemed a wonderful thing to me. Even now, when  we had both graduated from university and were living our lives, more  separately than I’d have liked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  the fact that our lives <em>were </em>separate again was the reason  that my laughter was so rare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>O-nee-sa-ma!</em>”  Again, the attempt at chastising me, drawing out each syllable.  Coupled with that image, now lodged firmly in front of my face, I  suppose I lost it a little. “Please do not laugh at me!” But Yumi  was beginning to feel my own good humor, so what could have been a  fairly harsh rebuke became nothing more than mock indignation coming  from that pretty, pretty face of hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later, something cold and wet touched my nose.  Without even thinking  about it, I opened my eyes and tried to get a better look at what it  was—it felt a little bit like a lick from the tiny tongue of a very  small kitten. <em>(that’s about the best defense I can put up.) </em> Before I knew quite what I was doing, my eyes were completely crossed  as well, and Yumi began to laugh. As soon as she did, I caught myself  and straightened my face, with greater success this time, but the  damage was already done, and though we began walking again, within a  few seconds Yumi was in stitches.  I suppose that’s not hard to do  for her.  She has a lovely sense of humor.  Though she teaches high  school, and I can’t imagine her doing anything else, she would make  a wonderful stand-up comedian.  At least, that’s what I think. She  tells me I’ve just not seen enough stand-up comics, that she could  never compare to their humor. She’s probably right, but I stand by  my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  walked in silence for a few minutes, not feeling the burning urge to  say anything, before the silence began to bother me. <em>(Always me,  never her.  Strange, that.) </em>“Yumi-san,” I said, still proper  then, still walking with a straight back and speaking in proper  Japanese. <em>(Writing a novel fixed that about me quick enough—see?  I just showed it there.) </em>“Tell me about how your first semester  as a teacher went.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!  It was wonderful!” she said brightly—she loved her job, and had  from the moment she set foot in the school she now taught at.  “It’s  a feeling like you wouldn’t believe,<em> Onee-sama. </em>It really  is—I don’t think anything in the world can quite match it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What—”  I stopped as I felt something cold and wet flutter against my hair.  I blinked twice. I had been preparing to ask her what she liked best  about it. Small talk. Sometimes it seemed that was all people could  do—all strangers could do.  Since we’d met up a kilometer or more  back, in the park, all we’d been doing was making small talk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had  been too long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt  like I never had anything to say sometimes, but beyond that, it had  been too long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wasn’t  that why I was writing now? So that I could maybe have something  interesting to say? One of the horrible things about being rich was  that I never seemed to have anything interesting to talk about. What  would I have? I knew nothing of my father’s work.  I knew nothing  of my mother’s life. I knew nothing of the world at large; so what  did that leave me?  The weather.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of  the things they’d taught me at University, though, was this: Irony  is a dish best served unexpectedly.  A wonderful appetizer to a party  nobody knew existed until the very moment you brought out that irony.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Irony,  indeed. “What about snow on your nose? Does that feeling come close  to teaching children?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  reddened a little, and then stopped where she was, and slowly, her  lips curved up again.  That wonderful smile, but this time there was  no trace of humor in it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  become a little braver since I saw you last,” she said quietly,  looking up at me.  I stopped too, and turned full-on to face her. “I  think that’s wonderful.” Something in her voice told me, though,  that she was lying a little. <em>(Can you really lie a little? I  think so.  I think I’ve learned that you can lie in just about any  way your little heart pleases.) </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The snow  was beginning to come down around us in droves now, beginning to  block out more and more of the rest of the world, beginning to soak  the both of us more and more, but I didn’t want to move quite yet.  I walked closer to her and took one of her hands, smiling now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  haven’t,” I said, putting that hand in between both of mine,  rubbing it to warm it up—she’d forgotten gloves, but in fairness,  so had I.  “I think I simply become stupider in cold weather.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think it’s stupid at all, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” she said,  taking my left hand in hers, so that now we warmed each other. “I  just think you….”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  what she meant to say. She meant to say that I didn’t need her as I  used to. I meant to deny it. Neither of us did, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  I let go with the hand that wasn’t being held <em>(maybe you should  just call it your right hand instead of being so ambiguous) </em>and  tipped her chin up towards me.  As I did, a piece of snow landed on  her nose, not small anymore, but thick and fluffy.  I wiped it off  with one finger. “I think we should go home,” I said.  “We can  talk there, if you want, but we’re apt to catch a cold if we  don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded at me.  She looked a little sad, and I think I knew why—it  felt like her old friend, her old sister, was slipping away from her,  and yet, for some reason, I felt no such sadness, which I think was  proof positive that precisely the reverse was true. There would have  been a time when her even thinking this would have brought me down,  forced me into myself, but it was long past, and maybe that’s why  what happened that day hadn’t happened earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And so  we started back down the path we’d come, holding hands. I smiled  the whole way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(I  suppose the reason I’m not going to try to sell this short story is  because nobody would buy it. People want </em>coming-of-age-loss-of-virginity <em>stories that involve lots of  drama, a big buildup to an even bigger climax, stupid things like  that. If I were to sell this, I’d have to change it, to have some  enormous scene in which one or both of us broke down in tears because  she felt abandoned by me, and me realizing simultaneously that I was  a lesbian and that the only way for me to comfort her was to </em>make  mad, passionate love to her<em>. Healing sex, they would call it, to  fix the wounds of separation, and it’s </em>bullshit<em> is what it  is.  That’s not sex. That’s a band-aid, and it never happens  because it never works.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mm. I  never used to swear. My speech has become rougher over the years.  Yumi tells me I still speak like a lady, but I don’t think a lady  would have called it “mad, passionate love,&quot; let alone </em>“fucking,” <em>nor would she have deemed “healing sex” to  be “bullshit.” They would have been, at best, </em>becoming  intimate <em>and </em>a fallacy. <em>I still generally speak like that,  but I kind of like being able to let myself go once and a while.  Besides, I’m never going to publish this, so who’s going to  know?)</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
We ran  the last quarter-kilometer back, because by that time, the snow had  become so thick that we were getting soaked through our jackets.  The  air seemed to glimmer now, the light which still shined through the  clouds seeming to dance off of each individual snowflake.  When we  reached my front door, I fished my key out of my pocket  rapidly—something that had taken some getting used to when I first  moved out of that enormous mansion—and veritably forced the door  open. We both entered as fast as we could, slipped as fast as we  could out of our shoes. Still holding her hand, I led her to the  living room, where I’d left the heater running, and it was only  there that we stopped and my brain turned itself back on for the  first time since we’d started sprinting.  We both immediately  crowded around the small space heater, huddled up in our jackets.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,”  Yumi murmured, whatever she’d felt before seeming to have receded  for now. “I never expected it to start coming down that strong. Is  it even possible for it to snow like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook  my head—actually, I just shook—and looked at her.  “I think if  we’d been a couple minutes later, we might have found the door  blocked by the snow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  she said, smiling at me. We fell into silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  living room has a single window, but the view is spectacular, so it’s  never really bothered me. My house is at the top of a hill that I  don’t have to climb—it comes up from a nearby river—and this  window faces it, and we could see it while still warming ourselves by  the heater.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  a look out the window,” I murmured to Yumi, already knowing what  was there, and not quite done thawing in any event.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  took a tentative look at first, also not prepared to be cold again.  From where we were squatting, we could only see the sky, a vast  panorama of gray, crumbling into white fluff.  But then Yumi stood up  straight, and her face lit up, and she rushed to the window.  I  stayed where I was for a moment, and then I followed her. She moved  aside a bit to give me some space, but I refused it, instead sidling  up next to her and draping an arm around her shoulder protectively,  shielding her from a little bit of the cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If the  sky was a panorama, the hill and river beyond it were an artist’s  masterpiece.  The entire section, mostly forested, was bare and  covered in white, and the sun which had danced off of the individual  snowflakes veritably shone off of the rapidly-growing piles of snow  on the ground, off of the frozen lake, a gentle wall of ice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  beautiful, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” she murmured in awe.  “Absolutely  beautiful.” The name bothered me of a sudden.  Why was she still  calling me <em>Onee-sama?</em> Wasn’t it obvious to her? Obvious  that I wasn’t her sister anymore? That she was grown up, and didn’t  need one of those anymore?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why was  I still calling her <em>Yumi-san</em>?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi-san…”  I paused, stuck in my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wasn’t  it obvious to me that I didn’t want her that far away from me?  Those two syllables seemed to me an impossible distance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  I couldn’t stop using them.  Wasn’t that brave yet.  That little  voice in the back of my head still told me, <em>don’t let her too  near. She’s still dangerous. Everybody is dangerous. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  I murmured.  “Don’t call me that anymore, Yumi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She gasped—a small, frightened noise—and looked  straight at me, her face in that instant the perfect image  of horror. For a moment, silence. Then, tensely, “What do you mean  by that, <em>Onee-sama?</em>” Whether this was a deliberate act of  disobedience—maybe one of Yumi’s first—or simply a slip, I  don’t think I’ll ever know. I don’t think it matters. Her voice  was lower now, more serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What <em>did </em>I mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I meant  that she was grown up. She was my friend. I didn’t want a little  sister. I wanted Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, that  wasn’t right.  I didn’t want her to keep calling me that because  I felt like an insufficient person for her. <em>I </em>was the one who  had gone to a college that her family couldn’t afford. <em>I </em>was  the one who had moved far away, deep into the bowels of Kyoto, to  seclude myself for a living.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I </em>was  the one that had taken her lessons, her invaluable lessons about how  to be…simply a <em>person</em>, rather than a Lady, and run.  Did I  deserve to be her big sister? Her <em>onee-sama</em>?  Absolutely not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Could I  say that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Absolutely  not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I let  it slide into silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  didn’t.  Yumi said, “No, no.  You don’t get to do that, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” more tensely than before.  “You don’t get to  say that and then just stop there. Maybe that worked when we were  eighteen, but we’re not anymore. We’re both adults now, <em>Onee-sama, </em>and I want to know what you meant when you said  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi had  grown up.  I had too, but she had more. She was ahead of me by at  least two steps, as was often the case.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What <em>did </em>I mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  into her eyes. Her big, open eyes, her eyebrows, now creased with  frustration and worry.  Her eyes were as big and deep as the snow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As the  snow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  out the window again. The snow was beginning to pile up already.  If  I went out in it, I’d probably have gotten my ankles wet.  The sun  still shone on it, and yet it didn’t melt. Even when faced with its  worst adversary, the one thing which could so easily destroy it, it  held fast.  Was this a metaphor for something in my life? Probably,  with a little creative interpretation. I didn’t really care to  think on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  Yumi’s eyes, I saw nothing but utter concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reflected  back, I have no idea what she saw. Seeing my reflection in her eyes,  I saw nothing but my face, impassive as ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She,  apparently, saw something else.  Her expression softened and she  smiled at me, and there was something in that smile that hadn’t  been there before, something more adult and less free-going and easy.  Something that made me feel as though the bottom had dropped out of  my stomach, emptying the contents all over the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  reached up with one slender hand and gently took in it a lock of my  hair.  With her other, she creased it, and I saw that it came out of  the ordeal wet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  a snowflake that was too stubborn to melt,” she smiled.  “Kind of  like you, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What did  she mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  what I had meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I didn’t  want her to call me <em>Onee-sama</em>.  I didn’t even want her to  call me Sachiko-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I’d  first seen her that day, I had felt this way, too. I had felt more  complete than I had the hour before. I had run through the snow, held  her hand, walked, talked about things that weren’t the weather  without even thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I had  thought before that Yumi was perhaps my antithesis. The person who  made me whole by being my polar opposite. That was no longer true—the  two of us had mellowed out considerably, admittedly in opposite  directions. I had become more passionate, less restrained. She had  become more restrained, calmer without having to resort to the  training that that school had given her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  even so, I found myself more lost in her eyes, the longer I stared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was that  simple friendship? Did simple friendship go that far?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sisterhood  didn’t, that was certain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still  smiling at me, she reached down with the hand that had cupped my  hair, and put around my shoulders, pulled me close to her. She looked  away from me then, and stared back out the window, the landscape  thick and beautiful, shining.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  beautiful,” she murmured.  “Absolutely wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  she wasn’t just talking about the scene.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  talking about everything.  All of it.  All of it was wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  stayed like that for a long time, in front of that window, watching  what I affectionally called “my backyard” become whiter and  deeper by the minute.  I’d have liked to stay there for longer <em>(I  suppose saying</em> forever <em>here sounds too campy, so I won’t.) </em> but, while the heater was warm, we were very, very cold, and wet on  top of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  sneezed, and that cut it for me.  Broke the camel’s back, as they  say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  taking a shower,” I said. “Right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at me with that same funny, adult look that I still didn’t  understand; <em>(not yet, anyway. I did, after all, still have my </em>chastity <em>virginity) </em>and said, “Please, feel free to  shower first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  blinked. “No, no, you’re a guest in my house. Please use the  shower before me. I’ll start your clothes drying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her face  screwed up as it often did when she was thinking, and after a few  seconds, she consented.  “I’ll leave my clothes outside the  bathroom, <em>O…</em>Sachiko-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not even <em>that </em>was all right with me, but I let it be.  Small steps.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Small  steps, indeed.</span></p>

I worked  idly, my hands doing what my mind should have been doing.  I should  have been thinking about how she was looking at me.  I should have  been thinking a lot of things.  I wasn’t.  I was in a state that a  male friend of mine once described as the <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">doing </span></em>state, the  state right before something you <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">know </span></em>is going to happen, when  that something is extremely important.  He usually cited it as the  thing that happened right before sex—“When my girlfriend is in  the next room, changing out of her clothes after a day at school, and  I know she’s changing into something sexy because of the way she’s  been looking at me all day, that’s when it happens. If you can keep  your hands busy, all thought vanishes from your head. Maybe it’s  anticipation. Maybe it’s some animal instinct—<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">get ready, here  I come</span></em>, that sort of thing. Whatever it is, it’s a nice  feeling. Almost as good as the act itself, for the few minutes of  silence in an otherwise crowded head.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It <em>was </em>a nice feeling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">About  ten minutes after she’d gotten in, the water shut off.  I shouted  to Yumi that there was a towel hanging on the rack, and that I’d  laid out a spare set of pajamas on my bed for her to wear. There was  no answer, but I assume she’d heard me.  You could hear a rat pass  wind from anywhere in the house, it was so small. <em>(And strangely  acoustic. Yumi told me I should say </em>hear a rat fart, <em>but I  don’t think I’ve sunk quite that low yet. Someday soon, maybe,  but not yet.) </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  bathroom door opened. I made a note not to look in the hallway until  I heard my bedroom door close, simply warming my hands over the  heater, allowing my mind to move again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t move fast, though, until I realized that I had waited there  like that almost a minute.  I heard Yumi take a deep breath from the  hall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  up just as she entered the living room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  completely naked. Her white skin shone a little like the snow, and  for a moment, I was rendered nearly breathless by how smooth and  perfect it was. She started walking towards me, and I saw the  gooseflesh standing up on her skin, and then I looked lower, and saw  another sign that it was cold. They were small but they were firm,  and…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes, yes  it was cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stood  up and whispered, “Yumi, what are you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped less than half a meter away from me. I could smell the sweet  scent of the shampoo she’d used—mine—and the soap.  Her cheeks  were bright red, and it certainly was not the fault of the heater.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  said,” she said, her voice still deeper, throatier this time, her  eyes looking at me the same way they had before, “that you didn’t  want me to call you <em>Onee-sama </em>anymore.  Is this…is this  why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  almost sounded subservient to me for a moment, but then I looked at  her face, and read what was on it like a book:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  hope. It was fear. The two tended to go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  doing what I couldn’t do.  She was opening herself up to me and  taking a chance with something so infinitely fragile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  exactly why I didn’t want her to call me that anymore. I knew what  I had meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was  precisely it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(Another  reason I could never sell this story—there’s no coming out drama.   There was none for me. I had never been with a man or a woman  before; I had come close with those evil old men from the parties,  and with Suguru but I had ducked out or they had, always near the  big, important part. I think the fact that I was once in love with  Suguru makes it clear that I am bisexual, but again, I don’t think  it matters, so it doesn’t go in here, even though the thoughts did  occur to me.)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How…do  we do this?” I asked, my voice turning throaty too.  Yumi smiled at  me—she told me later that she’d been with a woman once before, in  college, when she’d been feeling awful—and closed the rest of the  space with me, cupped my jaw in her hand, and—standing on her toes,  no less—brought my head down and kissed me. Her lips were soft,  warm, just as I remembered them; wonderful.  Her tongue darted into  my mouth, and she started to peel the wet clothing off of me. I  shivered as she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that, we made a reflection as white as the snow for a while.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
After we  had finished, I asked Yumi if she would feel okay just calling me <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko. </span></em>She laughed and told me that she would if I would  call her <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi. </span></em>If that was, you know, okay by me.  If I was  comfortable with that, on that comfort zone with her.  It occurred to  me that while she was saying this my head was resting on her left  breast. That made me laugh, and she laughed too, like somebody whose  joke has just been “gotten.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  moved in a few days later. We make a modest living now, between the two of us, but we  haven’t moved out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  all, this place is too beautiful in the winter.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N: I  was considering this to be an alternate ending to Fake in which I  simply wrote, “Okay, you know what? Fuck it. Rocks fall, and  everyone dies. The end.” But I chose to give Sachiko a happy ending  instead.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I jest.  Rocks would be too inelegant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I jest  again. I love writing Fake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The spoiler of this story: Sachiko doesn't die at the end of Fake. Sorry, guys, to ruin that experience for you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  always, thanks for reading!</span></p>
