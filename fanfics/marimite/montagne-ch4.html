<a href="../marimite/montagne-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>--Prochaine station, Sherbrooke.

It wasn&#39;t until I heard the voice of the metro announce the next station 
that I realized I had stepped on the wrong train. It had been the train 
to Henri-Bourassa we had taken to Sei&#39;s place the previous day, and 
without thinking about it this morning I had gotten for the train going 
to Henri-Bourassa, not to C&ocirc;t&eacute;-Vertu.

--Station Sherbrooke.

I got off the train and walked up the steps to cross the crosswalk 
Impossible to miss as I walked down the steps to the C&ocirc;t&eacute;-Vertu platform 
was a large mosaic, in which a man in a loincloth--Christ, I 
supposed--stood before a cross, inspiring artists painting his picture, 
patriots waving a Quebec flag, people dressed in what I recognized as 
college graduation garb from American movies, and what looked like 
surveyors, taking his image as inspiration for what they planned to 
build.

On the wall was a plaque announcing who had been depicted in the mosaic:

PREMIER BANQUET DE LA SOCI&Eacute;T&Eacute; NATIONALE DES CANADIENS FRAN&Ccedil;AIS
LE DEFIL&Eacute; DE LA SAINT-JEAN
SAINT-JEAN LE BAPTISTE PATRON DU CANADA FRAN&Ccedil;AIS
LE MONUMENT NATIONAL LES FEUX DE LA ST-JEAN
L&#39;ENSEIGNEMENT DES ARTS LIB&Eacute;RAUX
LE PRET D&#39;HONNEUR

So it was not Christ, but Saint John the Baptist. Of course. Sei had 
told me he was a patron saint of French Canada. I looked again. The 
cross was rather a walking stick shaped as a cross. For John the Baptist 
had not been crucified, had he? Rather beheaded and his head served to 
Salome on a dish.

I turned around to look again at the mosaic, to find a young Asian woman 
standing there, a tote bag in her hand, looking up at the mosaic 
herself. She was about Sei&#39;s age and height; she dressed well but 
simply, a white blouse under her raincoat and a simple black skirt going 
down to her ankles. Her dark hair was cut short, shorter than Sei&#39;s, in 
spite of the fact she didn&#39;t look like a boy at all; rather her features 
were those of a beautiful noblewoman of the sort one reads about in the 
Tale of Genji. Perhaps one who had already renounced the world.

Before turning away from Saint John the woman made the sign of the 
cross.

--

--H&eacute;, to&eacute;! Ta blonde s&#39;est lev&eacute;e!

--Hein? D&eacute;j&agrave;?

--D&eacute;j&agrave;? C&#39;est huit heures, d&eacute;j&agrave;! Envoye, l&egrave;ve-to&eacute; pis rend-m&oacute;e mon sofa! 
Bouge!

When I came downstairs that morning Sei was still on the couch where 
she&#39;d slept that night. On noticing me coming into the living room 
Madeleine rose from her chair at the kitchen table where she&#39;d been 
having breakfast, and went over to Sei to shake her and cajol her (I 
guessed) to her feet. Sei sat up, greeting me in Japanese with:

--Morning, Shimako. You sleep okay?

--Yes, thank you...how are you feeling this morning?

--Like shit.

In fact Sei didn&#39;t look very well, her eyes bleary and bloodshot. The 
club clothes she had worn the previous night looked like it. I turned to 
Madeleine to ask as best I could in French:

--Sei...elle va bien?

--Of course she&#39;s all right! replied Madeleine in English. She does this 
every weekend. Come on! Get up! she barked at Sei, thumping her lightly 
with the pillow Sei had been using last night. I told you a thousand 
times, don&#39;t sleep on my sofa!

--Shimako was in my bed. I had to sleep somewhere...

--Last week your girlfriend wasn&#39;t here and you slept on the sofa 
anyway. Come on, get up!

--She&#39;s not my girlfriend...

--Move!

Madeleine must have been trying to sound harsh, but she didn&#39;t really 
sound much harsher than a mother trying to get a reluctant, whiny child 
out of bed and ready for school. Certainly Madeleine wasn&#39;t so annoyed 
as to be unable to turn to me and ask with the sort of apologetic smile 
the mother might wear:

--I&#39;m sorry, Shimako. Do you want some breakfast?

In fact I have never liked breakfast, and I rarely eat before noon.

--No, thank you, I replied.

--Are you sure? replied Madeleine, with a conspiratorial smile on her 
lips. I thought Sei wanted to show you the whole of Montreal today!

--Just say yes, all right? put in Sei in Japanese. She wants someone to 
talk to, and I&#39;m not gonna be any use...

--Que c&#39;est que tu lui racontes, to&eacute;? asked Madeleine suspiciously.

--J&#39;ai dit que tu veux jaser pis y te faut une nouvelle victime, said 
Sei, able, weak as she was, to manage one of her evil grins.

--Comment! Envoye, said Madeleine, thumping Sei again, l&egrave;ve-to&eacute;!

--Okay, okay, simonac! answered Sei, rubbing her face with her hands 
before finally getting to her feet.

--Are you sure you&#39;re all right? I asked her.

--I&#39;ll live. Madeleine&#39;s right, I do this all the time. I&#39;m usually fine 
by lunchtime...anyway, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d be heading to McGill much 
before lunchtime. What are you doing up so soon? You got what? Five 
hours of sleep?

--Eight o&#39;clock&#39;s late for me. It&#39;s an hour from Shoguji to Lillian in 
the morning...

--Oh. Right. Yeah, I remember that routine...

Having reclaimed her sofa, Madeleine did not actually sit on it for now, 
but returned to the kitchen to resume her breakfast. Sei sat back down 
on the arm of the sofa.

--So. What do you wanna do? You wanna go to McGill right away? Or...

--Well, I had actually thought this morning would be a good time to go 
to Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours. If that&#39;s all right...

--Oh. Right. Might as well get that out of the way. Mother Superior&#39;ll 
kick your ass if you don&#39;t go, eh?

Sei chuckled at her own joke, then grimaced and rubbed her temples.

--Right. I&#39;ll take some aspirin, splash some water on my face, I should 
be good to go...

--Actually, Sei...

--Hm?

--If you&#39;re really not feeling well, I can go on my own. We could meet 
at lunch, when you&#39;re feeling better. Would that be all right? It&#39;s at 
Champ-de-
Mars station, right?

Sei looked a little surprised, not to say skeptical.

--Well, no, it&#39;s not right there. You&#39;d have to walk a ways...You sure 
you wanna go by yourself? I&#39;ll come with you to Bon-Secours, I&#39;ve 
survived worse than this...

--It&#39;s fine. If I get lost I&#39;ll ask. I&#39;m a big girl, you know, Sei. I 
can look after myself for a couple of hours.

I had said that to tease her, not to mention I had thought too that Sei 
would be relieved at being excused from having to go. As it was, though, 
she hesitated, as if trying to think of some objection. Finally she 
smiled, chuckled and answered:

--Guess you&#39;re better at it than me.

She stood up, adding:

--Okay. We can have lunch in Chinatown. You wanna meet up at 
Champ-de-Mars--I dunno--12:30? We can go to McGill after that. Unless 
you want to meet earlier...

--No, that&#39;s fine. We have all day really, right?

--Yeah. McGill&#39;s not going anywhere, I guess...

--Shimako? Sei? called Madeleine from the kitchen. Do you want breakfast 
or shall I eat it all?

--J&#39;veux pas d&eacute;jeuner, Madeleine. J&#39;vais en haut, all right? Shimako, 
I&#39;ll be upstairs, okay?

Sei did not go directly upstairs, going instead to the bathroom, to 
look, I suspected, for aspirin.

I was a bit intimidated by the sight of the table when I entered the 
kitchen. No wonder Sei had complained about putting on weight. Madeleine 
Cadieux&#39;s table was laid out with bacon, sausage, eggs and buttered 
toast, far more than two people would be wise to regularly eat on their 
own, I was sure. Then again, Madeleine had been eating on her own before 
I came down. It wouldn&#39;t have surprised me if she had been able (and 
willing!) to eat all that without my help.

--Just a cup of coffee, please, I said as well as I could.

--You don&#39;t want to eat? said Madeleine. All you want is coffee?

--Yes, please.

--Not even milk? she said, picking up a bottle.

--No, thank you.

Madeleine shrugged, poured me some coffee and sat back down to her 
breakfast. I found myself saying with a bow before I sat down, as if Sei 
had been my own child:

--Thank you very much for looking after Sei.

I heard the toilet flush, and then the sound of Sei heading upstairs.

--Don&#39;t worry! said Madeleine, dismissing the remark with a wave of her 
hand. She&#39;s the best tenant I&#39;ve ever had. Having her sleep on the 
sofa&#39;s a small price to pay, eh? she added, looking in the sofa&#39;s 
direction. I&#39;m lucky, you know? You don&#39;t want to know what I&#39;ve seen on 
that sofa when I come downstairs in the morning...that&#39;s why I don&#39;t let 
men into this house any more. My husband was bad enough, I should have 
learned my lesson, eh?

--Is it okay? That I am here?

Madeleine looked surprised that I would ask anything of the kind.

--Of course it is. You&#39;re Sei&#39;s friend. Why wouldn&#39;t it be?

--Sei said...you do not like her...bringing people here.

Madeleine&#39;s surprise took on a hint of annoyance.

--Did she say that? I didn&#39;t say that. Girls I don&#39;t mind. I just didn&#39;t 
want her bringing boys here at night. But she doesn&#39;t like boys, 
so...girls are okay.

--Do you like it here?

--Where?

--In the Village?

Madeleine&#39;s expression darkened visibly.

--The gay Village? Listen, this is my mother&#39;s house, and it was her 
house before all those gay people started showing up, all right? She 
left it to me and I&#39;m not leaving it until I die. And there are rich 
tapettes who&#39;d kill for this house, I know that well. You know? Well, 
they&#39;ll have to kill me, because I&#39;m not leaving alive!

--Tapettes?

--Queers. Gay guys. You know?

--But Sei is...

--You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like. You wake up in the night and hear a 
couple of men doing you know what or you come downstairs and two men are 
on your sofa naked like your living room was a...anyway, I don&#39;t want to 
rent to them any more, but I can&#39;t say no just because I know they&#39;re 
gay, they&#39;d take me to court, you know, so I don&#39;t rent to any men at 
all. It doesn&#39;t matter I don&#39;t mind girls. Girls are okay. Sei&#39;s okay. 
She&#39;s quiet. She pays her rent on time, we talk, she helps me with the 
bills...What? You don&#39;t think I make her big breakfasts for nothing, do 
you?

--You speak very good English, I said, trying to change the subject.

I had meant it as a compliment, but Madeleine sniffed, as if I had been 
patronizing her.

--Of course I speak English! Before I got married I had to work for some 
fat English jerk in Westmount who didn&#39;t speak any French, you know. And 
he wasn&#39;t going to learn French so he could speak to me, okay? In those 
days you wanted a job at all, you spoke English. Anyway, you don&#39;t speak 
French in Japan, right?

--No...

--Right!...But this jerk lives in Montreal all his life and won&#39;t speak 
French, you know? Then one day finally the French people in Quebec say, 
that&#39;s it, you have to let people speak French at work. And this guy--I 
didn&#39;t work for him any more, I was married by then, it was in the 
paper--this guy sells his house and moves to Toronto because he said he 
didn&#39;t want to speak French. I said, fine, go to hell, you big 
jerk!...Anyway, Sei&#39;s not like that. Sei&#39;s great, you know? She says to 
me, speak to me in French. I said, I speak English, if you want to learn 
how to speak French, you can take lessons, right? She says no, they&#39;ll 
teach her how to speak like in Paris, she wants to speak the French they 
speak in Quebec. Except she calls it le fran&ccedil;ais royal.

--Le fran&ccedil;ais royal?

--Yes! The French of the kings of France! And she knew that! I thought, 
all right, can&#39;t say no to that, right? So I talk to her in French and 
she learns French (Madeleine snapped her fingers) like that.

--It&#39;s hard...you sound different...they do not sound like you in my 
class...

--What? If it&#39;s fine for King Louis it&#39;s fine for me, its good enough 
for an old Montreal woman, eh? So, anyway...

Or Lady Oscar, I thought.

Madeleine took a bite of her eggs, and went on:

--So...really, are you her girlfriend?

--No, I replied. We were just friends. At school.

--All right.

Madeleine looked rather sceptical. She took a sip of her own coffee, and 
added:

--Could have fooled me, eh. You&#39;re the first person she&#39;s brought here, 
you know...In fact you don&#39;t know, do you? She&#39;s talked about nothing 
but you for weeks and weeks. She said--so you want to be a nun, eh? A 
Catholic nun?

I covered my mouth for a moment, trying to stifle an embarrassed laugh, 
and replied:

--No, not now...She told you I want to be a nun?

--She told me all about you. She really liked it, you wanting to be a 
nun. Maybe that&#39;s the sort of girl she likes, eh?

Madeleine laughed. She had obviously meant it as a joke, but I felt 
myself beginning to blush all the same. Madeleine must have seen, 
because she went on:

--But I guess not, eh?

--Well...when I was very young...I want to be a Catholic nun. I tell my 
father...and he sent me to Sei&#39;s school.

--Just like that? asked Madeleine, looking quite taken aback.

I wasn&#39;t quite sure how to explain in English, so I just said:

--My father is very nice.

--Hm...okay...I just thought you Japanese were all Buddhists, or 
something. You know?

--My father is a Buddhist. I was a child...it was silly...

--No, it&#39;s not silly. When I was little I wanted to be a nun too. Lots 
of little girls did. You know...wear the outfit, teach little kids, pray 
to God all day...you know? Of course I didn&#39;t, either...but your father 
said okay?

--Yes...he knew I was a child, I think. I don&#39;t know...

--Okay...because...let me tell you a story, okay?

Madeleine had finished her food. She took a sip of her coffee and went 
on:

--When I was in high school my class went on--oh, what&#39;s the word?--I 
want to say retraite--my whole class went together with the nuns to 
Sainte-Agathe for a week. In the Laurentides--the mountains, north of 
here. Did Sei tell you about them?

--Yes...

--She should take you. It&#39;s real nice there.

--Okay...maybe I will ask.

--So anyway, it was like a vacation. From reality I think...anyway...I 
was fifteen, I felt like I...something was missing. I wanted to be close 
to God...or nature...or maybe a boy. Probably a boy...

She laughed before going on:

--What? I was a girl like you, right? Younger than you. Anyway, I was in 
Sainte-Agathe with all my friends, it was lovely, I feel good, and one 
day, at the end of the week, one of the nuns comes to me and says, Miss 
Cadieux, did you ever think about wanting to be a nun? Think about it. 
Let me tell you, it was great being asked that, that the nuns thought I 
was good enough for that. When I came home I was in heaven! But then...

--What happened?

--My father thinks I&#39;m sick, because I was so happy I wouldn&#39;t eat! That 
was weird, you know. Because in my family we all liked to eat. I still 
like to eat, you know? You can see that, right?

Madeleine gestured to indicate her plump figure, and went on:

--And he says what happened? And I told him I wanted to be a nun...

--He did not want that?

Madeleine stared at me as if I&#39;d lost my senses.

--Of course not! He didn&#39;t want his only daughter to be a nun!

--But...I thought it was an honour...to be a nun...

Madeleine laughed derisively.

--What, are you joking? He said the only reason they wanted me to be a 
nun because I was pretty and the nuns liked pretty girls. &quot;It&#39;s always 
the smart ones and the pretty ones!&quot; he said. And I was, too! I was a 
bit big even then, but not that big, and some boys like that, right? My 
husband did, in the beginning. Then I got big like this and he ran off, 
the jerk...Anyway, I was smart too. I was the first in my family to go 
to high school, you know that? I could have gone to university too, but 
we didn&#39;t have the money, it cost too much then...see the world, too, 
like you and Sei, maybe even Japan, eh? All those temples. I&#39;ve seen 
them on TV--say, Sei told me, does your family have a temple or 
something?

--Yes...it&#39;s called Shoguji.

--What?

--Sho-gu-ji, I repeated, drawing out each syllable. In the country...

--Must be really pretty out there. Trees, mountains...like 
Sainte-Agathe. You should go, eh? Maybe you&#39;ll think it&#39;s like 
Japan!...Anyway, I wanted to go to college too, but I knew I couldn&#39;t 
because we weren&#39;t rich. Dad said, it&#39;s okay, go to high school and you 
can marry a college boy, right? They don&#39;t want to marry dummies. And I 
did. He was a jerk, but he was smart. Made okay money too. Then I say we 
should go to the Orient, but he wouldn&#39;t go...Anyway, thing was, that 
was Mom&#39;s idea, me going to high school. All her friends said, &quot;Mrs. 
Cadieux, what are you wasting money like that, sending her to high 
school? She&#39;s just going to get married!&quot;

Madeleine rested her forehead on her hands a moment, resuming her story:

--But oh my God...I thought he was going to go look for the nuns and 
kill them all!

--Like Sei?

--What?

--You said the nuns like pretty girls...

Madeleine hesitated a moment before answering:

--Yeah, like Sei. Me, I don&#39;t know, but my father said they like pretty 
girls. Except you don&#39;t want to know what else he said about them, all 
right?...Awful things about what he thought they wanted to do to me. So 
horrible I started crying...anyway, my mother finally told him to shut 
up, he wouldn&#39;t understand! Men are perverts, you know? And Mom comes in 
to my room and holds my hand, and she asked, do you really want to be a 
nun? I didn&#39;t say anything, I just wanted her there. Because...she 
didn&#39;t actually like nuns very much either, but she was a girl. She did 
understand, you know?...

--Do you want to be a nun now?

--Pardon? Said Madeleine, a little surprised by the question. Do you 
mean would I want to be a nun now?

--Yes...

--Hmm...

Madeleine took a long sip of her coffee, suddenly looking a little sad.

--I don&#39;t know...I mean, I never did anything about it. It was just a 
dream. You know? Like a little girl wants to be a ballet-dancer or 
something, because they all wear pretty dresses, right? Then when she 
grows up she doesn&#39;t think about that any more. I don&#39;t know, I think I 
just wanted the pretty dress. Because they still wore their--oh, what&#39;s 
the word?--they still wore those costumes nuns wear in the movies, 
right? Not like now, wearing ugly sweaters they got at the 
St-Vincent-de-Paul, smoking cigarettes...really butch...

--Butch? I asked.

--Yeah, butch! Like a man, you know! Though, Madeleine added, with a 
conspiratorial smirk, I tell Sei that, and she says, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m butch,&quot; 
and I say to her, you&#39;re young and pretty! She looks like a cute boy, 
eh? The nuns they look like ugly old men! Ugh! Who the hell wants to 
look like that?

Madeleine suddenly laughed.

--But anyway, whenever I used to fight with my husband, I&#39;d say, I 
shouldn&#39;t have gotten married at all, I should have been a nun!

--

Madeleine was inexhaustible, it seemed, willingly telling me much more 
of Montreal and how life was there, today and when she was young, 
sometimes sad, sometimes funny too. If I had let her, she probably could 
have continued all day--and would--but I had to be off at some point.

I finally managed to excuse myself from Madeleine&#39;s breakfast table 
after two cups of coffee. I went into Sei&#39;s room to fetch my bag to take 
to the bathroom so I could wash and dress there. Sei was in her bed, her 
back turned to me as I went in. I was as quiet as I could, but still Sei 
turned around to look at me.

--That you, Shimako?

--Yes...did I wake you?

--No...you taking off, then?

--Just as soon as I wash, yes...

--Okay. I&#39;ve got an umbrella downstairs. You can borrow it if you like.

--Thank you.

Sei propped herself up in the bed, smiling apologetically, and added:

--Shimako...thanks for dragging my ass home last night. I appreciate it. 
I&#39;m really sorry about all this...

--Don&#39;t mention it any more, Sei, really. I understand. I&#39;ll see you at 
lunch, okay?

--Say...Shimako? asked Sei, looking suddenly more serious.

--Yes?

--I remember saying some crazy stuff last night...you aren&#39;t mad, are 
you?

--What? Why? Because I said I wanted to go to Bon-Secours on my own? You 
were drunk. Drunk people say all sorts of things. Don&#39;t worry about it 
any more...

--I guess I mean...Shimako, I didn&#39;t do anything stupid last night, did 
I?

--No, why?

Sei smiled again, shook her head and said:

--Never mind...have fun, eh?

--

MERDE
IL PLEUT

It wasn&#39;t until I got outside and opened Sei&#39;s umbrella that I realized 
what it said. I had to laugh. It was just like her to have an umbrella 
like that.

I walked up rue Panet past the memorial and onto rue Sainte-Catherine 
towards Beaudry station. It was a rather drab day, making the Village 
look as worn and tired as Sei, the threatening and absurd names of the 
stores now looking merely absurd. I saw few people on the street on a 
weekday morning. At Beaudry station a man was standing outside the SAQ 
du Village, waiting for it to open. It was the beggar who had accosted 
us the previous night.

I walked into the station and down the stairs, showed the attendant my 
card and stepped on the moving sidewalk. It could not have taken more 
than a minute or so to get to the bottom, but it felt like I was 
descending for an eternity.

--Station Champ-de-Mars.

I had said nothing to the woman at Sherbrooke station, and she had said 
nothing to me. At Champ-de-Mars she got out first, and I followed her up 
the stairs. When I reached the top I thought for a moment I had emerged 
into the chapel.

The south and west walls of Champ-de-Mars station were made entirely of 
stained glass, banners of red and yellow cut by flourishes of purple, 
blue, green and white. It probably would have been dazzling in every 
sense had the weather been a bit better that day; as it was, it was one 
of the most beautiful pieces of stained glasswork I had ever seen. 
Perhaps I wasn&#39;t in a church, after all, but the glass would have done 
any church honour. Even the railing, designed to keep the unwary from 
falling onto the tracks below, couldn&#39;t help but make me think of a pew.

I looked around, admiring the stained glass for a few moments, long 
enough that when I turned around the woman from Sherbrooke station had 
gone.

It occurred to me I didn&#39;t really know where I was going. I approached 
the metro attendant, a large, moustached Canadian man well into middle 
age, sitting in his booth reading the Journal de Montr&eacute;al and looking 
bored.

--Excuse me, sir...I asked him.

--Yes?

--Where is Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours?

The attendant put down his paper, gave a deep sigh, as if he had long 
since tired of answering questions from tourists, and replied in a thick 
Canadian accent, pointing towards the right-hand door:

--Okay, you go out the door then go right, you know, then through the 
tunnel. Then you go up the hill on rue Gosford, you know, to Ch&acirc;teau 
Ramezay, then down the hill to March&eacute; Bonsecours. That&#39;s the big 
building with the dome, you know? The street is rue Saint-Paul. Then you 
turn left. You can&#39;t miss it, okay?

--Thank you.

--You&#39;re welcome, said the attendant, returning to his paper.

I couldn&#39;t help noticing an ATM just by the door. Another OSCAR. This 
one had a picture of a man and woman sharing an apple, with the caption

OSEZ S&Eacute;DUIRE

--

A freeway separates Vieux-Montr&eacute;al from the rest of the city. Crossing 
the bridge to the tunnel felt like crossing a frontier with all the 
nervousness that gave me when I had gone to Italy, and when I had come 
here. The tunnel was dark as the station itself had been bright, and 
neglected; the escalator was out of order and looked like it had been 
for some time. I walked quickly through the tunnel, looking behind me 
every few seconds, only to be greeted at the very end by a beggar, an 
odd-smelling cigarette smouldering by his side. He said nothing to me as 
I passed, not even to ask for change. I opened the door, and stepped out 
into the old city.

I started up the hill. On the hill I saw two fine old buildings, one 
flying a white flag with emblems in each of the quadrants; a rose, a 
thistle, a shamrock, and a fleur-de-lis; public buildings of some kind, 
I supposed. Below them both was a small treeless field, run through by a 
sort of ditch lined with stone.

At the top of the hill was Ch&acirc;teau Ramezay, which turned out to be a 
museum. As I started down it really was impossible to miss March&eacute; 
Bonsecours&#39; silver dome.

At first blush I thought rue Saint-Paul looked as it must have long ago; 
the street was cobbled, with antique street-lamps and trees, now just 
turning yellow, lining the sidewalk, and the March&eacute; itself, built of 
stately grey stone like the buildings on the hill, the fa&ccedil;ade just below 
the dome with classical columns, topped by a coat of arms with the same 
device as the white flag, and a name that looked as it might have in 
Queen Victoria&#39;s day:

MARCH&Eacute; BONSECOURS.

Across the street from the March&eacute; were house fronts in grey stone, long 
since converted to shops, with colourful names like Tant qu&#39;il y aura 
des fleurs and Saveurs de Provence. Just out front of the March&eacute; 
somebody had placed a hot-pink sign with black letters reading GRANDE 
BRADERIE DE MODE QU&Eacute;B&Eacute;COISE. Sei had complained that it was a poor 
imitation of Paris? This was how I had always thought a street in Paris 
would look, as it would have looked in a story book, or perhaps, in 
Rei&#39;s comics. Would Marguerite Bourgeois have recognized this place? 
Perhaps not; her Montr&eacute;al was very primitive. I remembered that much 
from school. But Lady Oscar might, perhaps.

I couldn&#39;t help but think of Rome too, how Yumi would have cheerfully 
dragged me into every clothes store in the city, begging to know if I 
could tell her which dress or hat made her look cuter. It was now I 
started wishing she had been there to drag me into la Grande braderie de 
mode qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise, possibly insisting on trying on ever single beaver cap 
and fur coat in the place. She could not have afforded to buy a single 
one, probably, but that wasn&#39;t the point of course; I had let her drag 
me to drag me out of myself.

As it was, there weren&#39;t many tourists here either that morning braving 
the drizzle on an autumn day. I couldn&#39;t help feel a bit of melancholy. 
I would like to say it was the rain, but I don&#39;t think so--I should have 
been pleased to have Vieux-Montr&eacute;al all to myself as it 
were--but...someone once said God created man because he needed someone 
else to share the beauty of creation.

I shook myself. Perhaps having others around merely helped me shake me 
out of my melancholy.

The attendant had been right. The bell tower of 
Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours, of copper long since turned green with 
patina, was clearly visible on the corner (of course) of Rue Bonsecours. 
As I approached, I could see at the back of the church a large statue of 
Our Lady, also in green patina, her arms outstretched towards the 
Saint-Lawrence River beyond. On the side of the church was hung a large 
sign reading TRAVERSEZ PLUS DE 2000 ANS DE NOTRE HISTOIRE.
MUS&Eacute;E MARGUERITE-BOURGEOYS CHAPELLE NOTRE-DAME-DE-BON-SECOURS

I tried the door. Locked. I had come a bit too early. What to do? Across 
the street from Bon-Secours were a self-styled Artisanat Canadien, and a 
restaurant Filles du Roy.

I stepped into the Artisanat Canadien. It turned out to be a souvenir 
shop of the nicer sort, nice enough I took shelter inside for a few 
minutes. (I had seen plenty of the nastier sort in Rome to want to give 
them a clear berth.) Inuit sculptures, lily flowers (fleurs-de-lis, of a 
sort) made of leather, and cards with American Indian designs. One card, 
depicting a goose with her goslings, was named &quot;Mother and Child.&quot; I 
decided to get it for Father.

I couldn&#39;t help but notice as well a can containing a small toy polar 
bear, reading:

CANNED POLAR BEAR CAUTION: THESE POLAR BEARS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LIE IN 
WAIT UNDER YOUR COVERS AND SNUGGLE YOU TO SLEEP.

I had to giggle. Very well, I thought. Yumi will get her polar bear 
after all!

I paid for the gifts, left the shop and returned to the door of 
Bon-Secours. Just above the door of the chapel were another mother and 
child, Our Lady with the Christ Child in her arms, both gold-plated, and 
the inscription

SI L&#39;AMOUR DE MARIE EN TON COEUR EST GRAV&Eacute; EN PASSANT NE T&#39;OUBLIE DE LUI 
DIRE UN AVE

What could a student of Lillian Academy do, but salute Our Lady wherever 
she saw her, not least when she had been specifically directed to do so? 
I put my hands together, bowed my head and said a Hail Mary as I had 
been taught.

--Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou 
amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, 
mother of God, pray for us sinners...

I was distracted just then by the noise of the wooden doors being 
unbarred. I looked up to see a young man, dressed in the costume of a 
New French colonist of the 17th century, opening the door of the 
sanctuary. He obviously guessed I was a tourist, because he greeted me 
with:

--Bonjour, p&egrave;lerine.

--

The chapel was brightly lit up even on this cloudy day, light-coloured 
pews, perhaps of pine. Before my eyes, dominating the wall behind the 
altar, was a beautiful depiction of her Assumption into heaven. I dipped 
my hand into the font of holy water as I had been taught, made the sign 
of the cross, and walked in.

At the back of the chapel were brochures in English, French, even one in 
Japanese. I took one of the French prayer cards and walked up the aisle, 
looking from side to side as I walked up the aisle. On the right were 
stained glass depictions of scenes from the life of Christ: his birth, 
his presentation at the temple in Jerusalem, the flight of the Holy 
Family into Egypt, his preaching in the Temple as a boy. On the left 
were parallels from the life of his mother: her birth, her presentation 
at the temple by Ste. Anne and St. Joachim, her parents, her marriage to 
St. Joseph, the Annunciation. On the ceiling above the altar was a 
painting of Mary&#39;s being crowned queen of heaven. 
Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours was Our Lady&#39;s house, as much as it was her 
Son&#39;s.

When I saw the chapel at Lillian for the first time in junior high 
school, and ever after, even on happy occasions like the Maria Festival, 
I always found it dark and sombre, only barely lit up by the stained 
glass windows even on a bright summer day. It was bare too: aside from 
the stained glass and the crucifix over the altar, there was nothing, 
save a statue of Our Lady, looking most out of place in her Son&#39;s house. 
I did not find it so odd, once I had been at Lillian Academy a while; 
the school as a whole was just as bare, even the Rose Mansion. It was 
not as dark, but just as bare, with only a few colourless prints in 
frames to brighten the walls. I had once asked Mother Superior why that 
was. &quot;If the girls that come to Lillian Academy can&#39;t escape the 
distractions of this world here, where will they escape them?&quot; she&#39;d 
said, a twinkle in her eye. But I had always wondered why the house of 
Our Lord was so dark and drab when the Garden of Maidens, where Our Lady 
stood, was so brightly decorated by nature. Perhaps that was as each 
wanted it; to Our Lord austerity, to Our Lady beauty.

That was Lillian&#39;s chapel as it was. Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours was how I 
had imagined it would be.

It was, of course, Ste. Marguerite&#39;s as well. Off to the left of the 
altar was a shrine to Ste. Marguerite herself, containing her remains. 
To one side by the wall were candles one could light for intentions, the 
kind one sees in every Catholic church. In the front pew a worshipper 
was praying. I put a coin in the slot, took a candle and lit it. I knew 
I should pray.

But for whom? Or what? I took a closer look at the prayer.

--B&eacute;ni sois-tu, Dieu de toute saintet&eacute;, pour la vie de Marguerite 
Bourgeoys. Donne-nous de vivre comme elle, passion&eacute;ment enracin&eacute;s &agrave; ton 
projet d&#39;amour sur chacune de nos vies. Qu&#39;&agrave; l&#39;exemple de sa vie 
voyag&egrave;re, nous allions l&agrave; ou il y a quelque bien &agrave; faire ou quelque 
oeuvre de charit&eacute; &agrave; exercer, toujours assur&eacute;s du bon secours de Marie.

&quot;May we, following her example, go where there is good to be done or a 
work of charity to be carried out, always assured of the good help of 
Mary.&quot; Of course; this was the church of Our Lady of Good Help. Was it 
she who had made way for me to come here? And why?

For Sei&#39;s sake? It might be for her sake. Sei must be unhappy. She was 
certainly lonely. I was not even sure the friends she had spoken of 
really existed; perhaps she had invented them to put me at ease. She was 
a solitary person by nature. So was I, which is why we had gotten along 
so well. No, that wasn&#39;t quite true. I--she--needed one person, no more, 
no less, to be content. That was why rue Saint-Paul had seemed so 
melancholy; it was beautiful, yes, but I knew I needed at least one 
other person to share it with, Yumi, Noriko...Sei.

I prayed to Our Lady and to Ste. Marguerite, for Sei. And for myself, 
for a sign of what I had been brought here to do, and the courage to do 
it.

--

Mother Superior had asked for a rosary from Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours. I 
thought, in the gift shop next to the church, I might have bought her 
much more than that. Books about Ste. Marguerite and the Congr&eacute;gation de 
Notre Dame de Montr&eacute;al dominated a shelf and a table. Religious articles 
of all kinds, icons, crosses, bells, statues of the Archangel Gabriel, 
the Holy Family, and Ste. Marguerite herself, dominated a wall. Pictures 
and postcards of Popes Benedict and John Paul, Vieux-Montr&eacute;al, 
Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours, and Ste. Marguerite sat by the window.

One caught my eye, a picture of an old woman in a habit, her hands 
holding a rosary, clasped together in prayer. I recognized it, of 
course; Mother Superior had a print of it over her desk at school. It 
was the True Likeness of Ste. Marguerite. I took one, planning to mail 
it later.

The rosaries were on the wall opposite from the statues. I picked out a 
wooden one for Mother Superior.

I remembered the rosary around my own wrist. I had not taken it off in 
bed, and it was still on my wrist. It occurred to me I should get 
something for Noriko. But what? And after all, what could I possibly get 
her at a Catholic church? Would it even be appropriate now? She had 
returned the rosary I had given her to me.

But then, she would need one for her own petite soeur. Noriko had said 
she had returned my rosary for fear she would be unable to let me go 
later. I was afraid she must be lonely too.

In Rome I remembered Yumi and Yoshino staring at rosaries, meaning them 
for their petites soeurs. Which of them had said it was sad to pick out 
a rosary for someone you did not know yet? I did feel a bit sad myself, 
taking down a metal rosary. But I did hope to see Noriko&#39;s petite soeur 
one day.

I brought the rosaries and the postcard to the young woman at the cash 
register.

--Is that all? asked the woman.

--Yes...excuse me...the True Likeness...where is it?

--The True Likeness? said the woman. It&#39;s here, in the museum. Would you 
like to see it?

--

A staircase led me up sixty-nine steps towards the lookout at the top of 
the church. It was a little chilly, and the view would probably have 
been better on a brighter day, but that was all right; looking west I 
could see a good part of the Old City. On the banks of the St. Lawrence 
River was a clock-
tower of white stone; across the river was a large island, dominated to 
the west by some presumably very modern buildings that looked like a 
collection of concrete blocks, and more to its centre, in front of me, 
by a structure that looked like a large spherical molecule. I&#39;d have to 
ask Sei what those were later. To my left the Radio-Canada building, 
marking Sei&#39;s house.

I could not see Our Lady here, but her statue must have been just above 
me, because on each side of the lookout was a green patina angel, acting 
as her guard.

In the chapel I had seen model ships hung from the ceiling as I passed 
through the aisle. A small staircase led down from the lookout to an 
exhibit room describing the terrors of sea travel in the days of Ste. 
Marguerite and long after, and of how the sight of the statue of Our 
Lady at the &quot;Sailor&#39;s Church&quot; would have been the first thing a sailor 
would have seen on arriving at Montreal. There was a list of sayings in 
English and French about the dangers of travel by ship. One caught my 
eye:

SI TU VEUX APPRENDRE &Agrave; PRIER, VA SUR LA MER

--

--Keeping the memory alive. That is the new vocation of 
Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours. Within its walls, each layer of soil and each 
archaeological find evoke the spiritual and material past of the site. 
We are invited to become pilgrims ourselves, to visit the strata of 
history and discover the past. Who knows what we will bring back from 
our journey...

The crypt, in the basement, was the remains of the first church at the 
site of Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours. Kept down there were all manner of 
objects from the church&#39;s history: angels, even a statue of Our Lady 
that had once decorated the chapel upstairs. In a few exhibit cases were 
portraits of Ste. Marguerite, Lord Maisonneuve, priests, bishops, as 
well as of nuns of the Congr&eacute;gation de Notre Dame, as well as some holy 
medals.

In one exhibit case was an old child&#39;s reader, once used in the schools 
of the Congr&eacute;gation, open to the following poem:

Trois petits loups dans un grand bois
--C&#39;est un conte de ma grand-m&egrave;re,
Virent passer avec son p&egrave;re,
Un petit gar&ccedil;on, une fois
Le premier loup dit, Qu&#39;il est rose!
Le second loup dit, Qu&#39;il est blanc!
Le troisi&egrave;me dit une chose
Que je ne redis qu&#39;en tremblant...
Ils voulaient manger l&#39;enfant rose,
Le petit gar&ccedil;on rose et blanc.

--Sit down. I&#39;ll make us some tea.

--No, please...that should be my job.

--I insist.

During an idle moment Rosa Chinensis en bouton had dragged me to the 
Rose Mansion out of the blue on Lillian&#39;s Field day. It had been a day 
like this in autumn when the leaves were turning. Rosa Chinensis en 
bouton looked more than a little odd, making tea in her physical 
education outfit. It wasn&#39;t even that she was fumbling over the effort 
of making the tea herself, as if she had never done it before; I 
suspected she had rarely had to do it on her own. The fact was Sachiko 
Ogasawara was not the sort one would imagine deciding to make someone 
tea out of the blue just out of kindness.

I sat down. At last the tea was drawn, and Rosa Chinensis en bouton put 
a cup in front of me, and took a seat beside me, not in front of me as I 
had expected.

--What was it you wanted to see me about, Rosa Chinensis en bouton?

--I meant to ask you, Shimako...I&#39;d like you to be my petite soeur.

Most first-years, I knew, would have committed murder to hear those 
words from the beautiful Rosa Chinensis en bouton, but when I heard them 
myself my heart froze.

--Me? I managed to get out, trying not to display my shock.

--Is that all right?

--Well...I don&#39;t think...

--Please, please, no false modesty. You know as much about the duties 
and responsibilities of the Yamiyurikai as anyone. You&#39;ve displayed the 
conscientiousness a Yamiyurikai member needs. You get on well with us 
all. Oneesama&#39;s particularly taken with you. You&#39;ll make an excellent 
Rosa Chinensis one day, we&#39;ve both agreed on that. Are you interested?

It sounded like a sales pitch. I had rarely seen Rosa Chinensis en 
bouton smile, and it looked a little forced. I noticed too she was 
sitting a bit too close, looking at me a bit too intently.

--Rosa Chinensis en bouton, I asked at last, did Rosa Chinensis ask you 
to ask me that?

--I wouldn&#39;t have asked you without her permission, she replied, not 
answering the question.

--I mean, I said, looking away, doesn&#39;t it worry you that we barely know 
each other?

Rosa Chinensis en bouton&#39;s smile faded.

--We know each other as well as you know anybody else on the 
Yamiyurikai.

--I&#39;m sorry, Rosa Chinensis en bouton, I said politely, but I&#39;m going to 
have to refuse.

--Hm. Perhaps that&#39;s not well enough. But if you don&#39;t know me well 
enough, you don&#39;t know anybody else on the Yamiyurikai well enough. For 
some there&#39;s more to know than for others. I&#39;m asking to be your grande 
soeur, not your wife. I know whose wife I&#39;m going to be. That was 
decided a long time ago.

Rosa Chinensis en bouton&#39;s smile had turned into a full fledged scowl. 
She rose to go.

--Shimako Todo, one does not choose one&#39;s grande soeur, it is the grande 
soeur who chooses.

She closed the door behind her as she left the room. I finished my tea, 
not wishing to follow her immediately, to save her embarrassment.

When I came back to the sports field, I saw Rosa Chinensis with her 
bouton. Chinensis en bouton was still scowling, but Chinensis herself 
was covering her mouth, stifling laughter. I managed to come close 
enough to hear, but not close enough for them to notice me pass.

--You don&#39;t take rejection very well, do you, Sachiko!

--But just like that!

--Jealous? I would be.

--Oneesama!

--Actually, I thought she might say that. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! 
Whatever will Rosa Gigantea say?

--What! You did this on purpose?

--Is she that stubborn? No wonder I can&#39;t help but like her. The one 
reminds me of the other. I am a little jealous. But they&#39;ll make a good 
match, no?

--She&#39;ll be waiting a long time!

Rosa Gigantea offered me her rosary the very next day, under the turning 
leaves of the cherry tree where I had first met her.

I suddenly found the crypt rather chilly. I headed for the steps 
upstairs.

--

On the ground floor was a wall exhibit, sketching Ste. Marguerite&#39;s 
life. What really caught my eye was a table on which were laid out the 
comic books Sei remembered, telling of Ste. Marguerite&#39;s life. There was 
even one in Japanese, which I was sure I had lying around somewhere.

Another staircase led down to an elevator to take me to the second 
floor. Along the wall were scenes from the life of Ste. Marguerite, 
arriving for the first time at Quebec City, traveling up the St. 
Lawrence, arriving at last at Montreal.

Up the elevator was a pleasant surprise, one that couldn&#39;t help but make 
me smile and laugh when I saw it--the life of Ste. Marguerite, detailed 
in scenes peopled by dolls, made over the years by the nuns. As a child 
might have told it, as Sei probably learnt it. How Marguerite was a 
frivolous girl, the daughter of a rich candle-maker in France, loving 
fine cloth and jewellery. How she had seen a statue of Our Lady on 
Rosary Sunday and been so moved by its beauty she wanted to become a 
nun. At last she became a teacher for the Congregation de Notre Dame de 
Troyes; when she had problems, she went to church to pray. One day, Lord 
Maisonneuve invites her to come teach in Canada.

One scene caught my eye: &quot;The decision to leave for Canada is a 
difficult one, but Marguerite knows that the Blessed Virgin supports her 
choice.&quot; I knew the story behind that scene; Our Lady had appeared to 
Ste. Marguerite, dressed all in dazzling white, saying to Marguerite, 
still wondering whether she should go to Canada: &quot;Go, I will not abandon 
you.&quot;

In the scene were dolls of Ste. Marguerite and Our Lady. I couldn&#39;t help 
but think the doll of Our Lady looked like a bride.

--

Our Lady never had appeared to me.

I can no longer remember where I did get the idea that I wanted to be a 
Catholic nun. Perhaps it was as Madeleine Cadieux had said, that it was 
a childish fancy, of the sort one might get from a child&#39;s comic book; a 
girl might want to be a nun, or a ballerina, or a bride, so she could 
wear a pretty dress. Something frivolous like that. I mightn&#39;t have been 
the only one; heaven knew there were plenty of frivolous rich girls at 
Lillian Academy. It was only when I got there that I saw that not only 
were the nuns rather old, they no longer even dressed as I had imagined; 
the Congregation had not required one for many years. They dressed 
modestly, though well, often better than the lay teachers; but there was 
nothing to distinguish them from the lay teachers, beyond the fact that 
they tended to be by far the oldest at the school. The only one who 
still wore her old habit was Mother Superior. I remember asking her why 
that was; after all, she was not even the oldest nun at Lillian.

--It&#39;s like my skin, child, she had replied. I can&#39;t remove that, can I?

--No, of course not, I answered.

--Besides, she had gone on, a twinkle in her eye, nobody would take me 
seriously without it.

She might have meant it, too. It marked her as a figure of authority. 
But Mother Superior could only say that because she did not actually 
pretend to be anything other than another human being; it helped that 
she liked me, too. Once I realized she was just another human, though, 
though I was baptised at last, with Mother Superior as my 
godmother--something she often did for those occasional students who 
decided to convert--I no longer felt the urge to become a nun.

That was all right with Mother Superior.

What had always struck me as odd was why my father had gone along with 
my fancy so readily. To be sure, Lillian Academy was one of the best 
girl&#39;s schools within a hundred kilometers of Shoguji, Catholic or 
otherwise; I never regretted being sent there. But it wasn&#39;t just that. 
I had asked his permission to go, as I had told Sei, but it had not 
actually been my idea to go to Canada. One day in spring, just after my 
baptism at Easter, he called me into his office at Shoguji.

--Shimako, he asked, have you thought about where you&#39;d like to go to 
university?

--I&#39;m not sure, Father, I replied. Perhaps Lillian.

--Hm.

My father thought a moment, and went on:

--The truth is, Fujiwara called me the other day. He asked about you. 
You remember him, yes?

--Yes I do, I answered.

In fact I only remembered a little. They had been friends when they were 
young men, but that was as much as I really knew. I had only been a 
small child when Mr. Fujiwara had last visited Shoguji.

--He asked if Shimako mightn&#39;t want to come and study there--in Canada I 
mean. You could stay with him if you liked. I wanted to know if you 
thought that was a good idea.

--What?

--Or don&#39;t you?

--Father! I said, laughing nervously. He must have been just being 
polite! I couldn&#39;t impose on him like that!

--No, of course not...but I thought it was a good idea. It wouldn&#39;t even 
have to be Vancouver. I was thinking of your friend Sei too. Where did 
she go again? Toronto?

--No, Father. Montreal.

--Perhaps you could go there, have a look there, as well as Vancouver. I 
remember her being very fond of you. She would be glad to see you, 
surely?

--But Father...Is this really all right?

--Of course it is. Would I have made such a suggestion if it wasn&#39;t in 
my power to follow through on it? We&#39;re not poor, you know.

--I mean...who will look after you?

Father laughed.

--What? I&#39;m not that old yet!

--I mean...isn&#39;t my place here?

On the wall of my father&#39;s office was a wooden Buddha. He rose, walked 
over and touched the Buddha a moment, contemplated it, before going on:

--I&#39;ve always wondered if your place was here.

--Father...I don&#39;t understand.

Father went on, looking at the Buddha, wistfully:

--If one is truly looking for the Way, then it&#39;s a small price to pay to 
walk all the way to the West to find it. When you asked to go to Lillian 
Academy, I thought, very well. All you had to do was take a bus into the 
city.

He looked back at me, adding:

--So, did you find it there?

I did not reply. Who but the most vain person would have said &quot;Yes, I 
have found enlightenment,&quot; even if it were true? And for all I had 
learned at Lillian, I did not think it was true.

My silence must have been answer enough, because he went on:

--Very well. Perhaps you really do need to go to the West. You won&#39;t 
even have to walk. It&#39;s just a short ride on an airplane.

--But Father, I asked, are you sure I&#39;d find it there?

--I wonder...but then...

He turned back to the Buddha, musing:
--But then...if I could have found enlightenment at Shoguji, selling 
charms to tourists and schoolgirls come to pray for boyfriends, I&#39;d have 
found it long ago. Fujiwara asked me to come with him, when he left. Did 
I ever tell you that, Shimako?

He never had. My father did not talk about himself much. I had never 
thought very hard of him as ever having been anything than the priest at 
Shoguji, much less that he had ever had any doubts or that I would ever 
hear them speak them so bluntly.

--No, Father...did you want to?

--Certainly I wanted to.

--Then why didn&#39;t you go?

Father turned back to me, smiling sadly.

--Your grandfather wouldn&#39;t let me. He said my place was here.

--

There was one more room, containing relics of the Congr&eacute;gation and their 
work: photos of the sisters with their pupils through the generations; 
drawings and paintings of their Mother House, now long since removed to 
another part of the city; books on history, chemistry, trigonometry; a 
globe; even cutlery from the refectory of one of their schools in 
Montreal.

In the next room, the very last, was the True Likeness of Marguerite 
Bourgeoys.

The True Likeness was not the only painting in the room. On the 
left-hand wall was another painting of Ste. Marguerite that I had never 
seen before. I looked at it for a few moments. It was more idealized, 
symmetric, Ste. Marguerite&#39;s face looking a good fifteen years younger, 
a smile on her lips.

The True Likeness itself was the centrepiece of the back wall, with 
relics of Ste. Marguerite in a glass case in front of it, and some of 
her sayings written on the wall on each side. Before the True Likeness 
were set a few chairs, on which one might sit, reflect and pray in the 
presence of the True Likeness. One one of the chairs a woman sat in 
prayer.

When I turned to look at her, after looking at the relics, I saw it was 
the woman I had met at Sherbrooke station.

--

--

The woman from Sherbrooke station looked up as I looked towards her.

--Excusez-moi, I said, thinking I had disturbed her prayer.

--Tiens, pourquoi? she responded, with a reassuring smile. Her Japanese 
accent was unmistakable.

--Gomen nasai, I tried again in Japanese.

--Iie, daijobu, she answered. It&#39;s quite all right.

--I should get out of your way, I said.

--Well, then, why don&#39;t you sit? she said, indicating the seat beside 
her.

I sat as she had asked, and we sat in silence for a few moments, looking 
at the True Likeness. It was she who broke the silence, asking me:

--I saw you looking at the other painting a moment ago. You seemed 
rather taken by it. I was afraid it had led you astray.

--Led me astray?

I looked towards her. She was still smiling, now a hint of a tease in 
her eyes.

--You wouldn&#39;t be the first.

--No...I just had never seen it before. How could a painting lead me 
astray?

--What do you think of it, then?

I thought a moment.

--Ste. Marguerite looks much younger. Healthier. In the True Likeness 
she looks like she is in pain...

--No. The woman over there is not Ste. Marguerite.

--What do you mean?

The woman looked back at the True Likeness, and went on to tell a story:

--That is the true face of Ste. Marguerite, as she lay dying. It was 
painted just after her death. Anybody who had known her would have 
recognized the face in the painting as hers. The years passed, and the 
time came when nobody remained who had known Marguerite Bourgeoys or 
seen her face. The sisters were sure Marguerite Bourgeoys could not have 
looked like that, such a frail old woman. So little by little, over the 
generations, they altered the painting to make her look how they thought 
she would have looked. How they were sure Mother Bourgeoys must have 
looked. One day, not long ago, a man who had spent many years studying 
art took a look at the painting, and said at once, &quot;This is not Mother 
Bourgeoys!&quot;

She pointed back to the painting on the wall, going on:

--He was sure the men of her time would not have painted her that way. 
They would have painted her as she was, not as the sisters thought she 
should be. But even so they copied the painting of Mother Bourgeoys--for 
that is how they thought of it--and gave the real painting to the man. 
He carefully removed the paint, and found there was another painting 
underneath. The True Likeness of Ste. Marguerite.

The woman turned back to the True Likeness.

--Her expression is of pain. But of compassion. Like that of Christ on 
the cross...perhaps. You see...nobody in this world now knows what 
Christ looked like. And men in their folly have depicted him as they 
thought he ought to look, with fair hair and blue eyes, perhaps, not as 
he was. Even men of great faith saw him through a glass darkly, at best. 
The darkness being their own folly and pride. We are lucky to see Ste. 
Marguerite as she really was. Only the saints in heaven, being purified 
from sin, are so blessed as to be able to see Christ as he really is...

--I&#39;m sorry, I said at last. You&#39;ve thought about this much more than I 
have.

The woman turned to me, laughing softly, looking a little a hint of 
embarrassment in her expression. It was for all that a beautiful laugh, 
I thought.

--I&#39;m the one who should be sorry. You were the one who was afraid she 
was disturbing me. Now I&#39;m the one disturbing you. Forgive me...it&#39;s not 
often I get to speak Japanese any more...

--No, it&#39;s not that...it&#39;s just...at my school the principal had the 
True Likeness over her desk. I&#39;d never seen it myself until now.

--This is your first time here, then? asked the woman.

--Yes...yes it is.

--I hope it&#39;s not the last. I come here quite often to pray. Not always 
here, more often in the chapel, but I come as often as I can.

--Actually...how did you get here?

--What? To Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours?

--Yes...you probably didn&#39;t notice me, I said. We took the same metro 
car to Champ-de-Mars, but I didn&#39;t see which way you&#39;d gone out. I 
didn&#39;t think you were going the same place as I was...

--Oh!

The woman&#39;s eyes widened a little in recognition.

--I remember you now. I saw you at Sherbrooke station this morning. By 
the mosaic of Saint John...

--Yes...tell me...is one supposed to cross oneself when one sees Saint 
John?

--What?

The woman laughed a little louder, covering her mouth as she did, 
blushing a little.

--Is one indeed? Nobody will think you rude if you don&#39;t, if that&#39;s what 
you mean. People pass it all the time without even looking at it, never 
mind making the sign of the cross. But I always do. You must have found 
it odd!

--No, no...I just wasn&#39;t sure.

--Actually, miss...

--Shimako Todo, I said.

--Oh dear, where are my manners? said the woman, offering her hand. 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Kubo.

--Pleased to meet you, I said, struggling with the name, Tei-re-su...

--Very good! said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Like Ste. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de Lisieux? I said, taking her hand.

--Yes, that&#39;s right.

I squeezed Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#39;s hand gently a moment and let it go. She asked me 
then:

--I meant to ask...how did you get here yourself, Miss Todo?

--Shimako&#39;s fine...

--Is it? Well, then, call me Th&eacute;r&egrave;se!...did you come by the tunnel, 
Shimako?

--Yes.

--That explains it...I should show you the way I come here from the 
metro. It&#39;s rather safer, and much prettier. Would you like that?

--Oh no, I said, I couldn&#39;t impose...

--I&#39;m on my way back anyway. Please.

Obviously I wasn&#39;t in any real hurry to get back to Champ-de-Mars 
station-
Sei wouldn&#39;t be there for quite a while. But knowing a better way to the 
metro was a useful thing to know, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was friendly enough, and 
apparently glad enough of the company herself, that I couldn&#39;t find it 
in myself to turn her down.

Actually, it was more than that. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had captured my interest when I 
had first seen her at Sherbrooke station, and her story about the True 
Likeness was thought-provoking enough that, in spite of my protests, she 
had captured my imagination.

Sei had captured my imagination too, under the cherry blossoms at 
Lillian.

--

We left Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours by the chapel, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se genuflecting at 
one of the pews as we turned to go, I following suit.

Our conversation about Sherbrooke station had reminded me of something.

--Actually, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se...I asked.

--Yes?

--If you come here often...you must know the chapel very well.

--I know a little...

--Well, then...is Saint John the Baptist here? I couldn&#39;t find him.

--Why, of course he is. I&#39;ll show you.

By the door of the chapel were several paintings; on one side was a 
portrait of Ste. Marguerite, beside that a portrait of what I thought 
was the Holy Family, except there was not just one boy--the boy 
Jesus--but another boy with him.

--There. John and Jesus were relatives. There they are together, at 
play.

--

MERDE IL PLEUT

It was, in fact, still drizzling somewhat when we stepped outside the 
church, but I was still a little reluctant to open Sei&#39;s umbrella.

--That&#39;s an interesting umbrella, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--It&#39;s not mine, I replied, trying not to sound too defensive.

--Oh? She replied. Whose is it then?

--It belongs to a friend. I&#39;m staying with her in Montreal.

So we walked together along rue Saint-Paul, back past the March&eacute; and any 
number of shops and restaurants, until we finally came to a square. On 
the corner was a souvenir shop announcing the name of the square:

SOUVENIRS PLACE JACQUES-CARTIER

and a red signpost pointing the way to the Champ-de-Mars metro station.

--Didn&#39;t she want to come with you this morning?

--She wasn&#39;t feeling well. I&#39;m going to meet her for lunch later.

--I see. She lives in Montreal, then?

--Yes. She goes to McGill. We&#39;re supposed to go there after lunch.

--Would you like to go there yourself?

--Perhaps. The truth is, I came here to visit the universities.

--It&#39;s an excellent university. I&#39;m planning to go myself, God willing.

Save for a few sightseers gathered under their own clump of umbrellas, 
perhaps waiting for a guide, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and I had place Jacques-Cartier to 
ourselves as we walked up the hill, past the trees planted here with 
their turning leaves and the souvenir shops and restaurants lining the 
side of the square.

--Haven&#39;t you graduated from high school? I asked. I had been sure she 
was a bit older than I was.

--Actually, yes I have...I go to Marianopolis College. It&#39;s a junior 
college in Montreal. I wanted to go to McGill when I graduated from 
there.

--Do you like it?

--Yes...it&#39;s one of the best in Canada. The campus is beautiful too, 
especially in autumn. And, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se added, turning to me, it was founded 
by the Congr&eacute;gation. How could I not go?

--The Congr&eacute;gation de Notre Dame?

--Yes. The truth is, all I know I learned at the schools of the CND.

From the bottom of the hill I could see a pillar at the top, on which a 
statue stood. It wasn&#39;t until we were near the top that I noticed to my 
right a small park in which another statue stood, a man wearing a modern 
suit and glasses, his hands outstretched.

--Is that Jacques Cartier? I asked Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, as we approached the pillar.

--Oh no! she replied. That&#39;s Admiral Nelson.

--Wasn&#39;t he English?

--Well, yes. The English ruled Montreal for a long time, you know.

--And who is that? I asked, pointing to the statue in the park.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se suddenly got a playful glint in her eye and replied:

--Colonel Sanders.

It was true that the statue&#39;s arms were outstretched exactly as were the 
arms of the statues of Colonel Sanders one might find outside a Kentucky 
Fried Chicken franchise anywhere in Japan. So it took me slightly longer 
than it really should have to realize that of course Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was joking.

--No it isn&#39;t! I said, covering my mouth, trying not to laugh too loud.

--No, of course it isn&#39;t. That&#39;s Jean Drapeau. He was mayor many years 
ago. But I think he looks like Colonel Sanders.

--Really?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se smiled, now looking very playful, and answered:

--That&#39;s why it&#39;s nice to have another Japanese person here. When I tell 
Canadians that they all think I&#39;m mad!

We had reached the top of the hill, a signpost marking the street we had 
to cross as rue Notre-Dame. A man stood by a horse-drawn carriage, 
apparently waiting in vain for a passenger, both horse and man looking 
rather bedraggled.

--Actually, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se...is that really your name?

--What? My Japanese name, you mean? No. But that&#39;s what everyone calls 
me.

--Why is that?

Across rue Notre-Dame was another small square, dominated by a fountain, 
already turned off for the autumn, and a statue of a man called 
Vauquelin. I followed Therese to the end of the square. Below us by way 
of some steps was the field I had seen walking up the hill from 
Champ-de-Mars station, cut through by the stone-lined ditch. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se 
stopped at the top of the steps and sat down, not seeming to mind the 
damp. I gingerly sat down beside her, hoping my skirt wouldn&#39;t get too 
wet.

--The truth is, she said, I&#39;m a novice. With the Congr&eacute;gation de 
Notre-Dame de Montr&eacute;al.

--Oh...!

--Surprised? said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

I shouldn&#39;t have been. When I had seen her first I had thought she 
looked every inch a nun. It made perfect sense. But even Mother Superior 
went by her real name, not the name of a saint.

--Then...did they ask you to take the name of a saint?

--Oh no...they don&#39;t do that any more...the truth is...it happened that 
when I came here to go to school, and I told the sisters at my school I 
wanted to become one of them...

--At Marianopolis?

--Oh no! At my high school. I finished high school in Canada.

--I see.

--Anyway, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se went on, they told me I was the youngest person they&#39;d 
had in a long time, who was seriously interested in becoming a sister. 
They had trouble pronouncing my name, so one of the sisters took to 
calling me Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, after Ste. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, because I was so young. So the 
sisters called me Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and eventually my classmates called me 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se too. And Th&eacute;r&egrave;se became my name.

--But then, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, I asked, what are you doing here?

--I&#39;m studying to become a sister with the CND, she said. Or didn&#39;t I 
just tell you?

--But you could have studied to be a sister in Japan, surely.

--Our Lady wants me here.

I must have looked amazed, because she added:

--Or don&#39;t you believe she does?

--I do...I just wondered how you knew she wanted you to come this far 
away.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se suddenly stood, outstretched her arms and said dramatically:

--One morning, when I was fully awake, a tall woman dressed in a robe as 
of white serge, said to me very clearly: &quot;Go, I will never forsake you.&quot;

She suddenly smiled, to reveal she was teasing, and added:

--Perhaps you expected a story like that?

I admit I felt rather foolish to seem to doubt her vocation so much. She 
dropped her arms, laughed sheepishly as if to apologize for her joke, 
and went on:

--I wish I could tell it to you myself. I have never had Our Lady show 
herself so plainly to me as she did to Ste. Marguerite. I only dream of 
being that worthy. There are some who have seen Our Lady for themselves. 
I&#39;m not one of them...but I have faith in her all the same. That this is 
where she wants me to be.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se sat down beside me again, adding:

--Because, the truth is I owe her my life. To her and Ste. Marguerite.

--Really?

--Yes. The truth is...when I was eight years old my parents and I were 
in a terrible car accident in Tokyo. My parents were killed, and by 
rights I should have been too. As it was I was on life support. The 
doctors had just about given up hope. My mother had gone to one of the 
schools of the CND, and had kept in touch with one of the sisters. 
Sister Saori. When she heard what had happened she came to the hospital 
to pray for the intercession of Ste. Marguerite, and of Our Lady. When 
my uncle and the rest of my father&#39;s family came up from Nagasaki she 
asked them to do the same. And I completely recovered.

--Because of her intercession? Ste. Marguerite&#39;s?

--Yes. And Our Lady&#39;s.

--So...that&#39;s why you wanted to become a sister, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? Out of 
gratitude?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked at me with a surprised, not to say shocked expression.

--Want? Shimako, I didn&#39;t choose Our Lady. She chose me. The first thing 
I was told when I got well enough to understand what had happened was 
that Our Lady and Ste. Marguerite had saved my life. I owed them 
everything. I&#39;ve never forgotten that for a minute. How could I refuse 
them a thing?

--I&#39;m sorry, I said, feeling foolish yet again.

--Don&#39;t be, she said, reassuringly. But you do understand, yes? It is 
the Lord who calls us to him, not the other way around.

--I do, I said.

I found myself wondered just then how old Sachiko Ogasawara might have 
been when she was told she was to marry Suguru Kashiwagi. Eight? Seven? 
Six?

--I&#39;m glad, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. Not everybody does.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked out into the rain towards the new city across the 
freeway, and continued:

--In any case, my uncle took me in, and sent me to the school of the CND 
in Nagasaki. By the time I was ready for high school, it happened Sister 
Saori had become the principal at a school in Musashino, and I went 
there for my first year staying with her at the convent there. 
But...well, it&#39;s a long story, really, but Sister Saori decided that if 
I really wanted to be a sister, that it was best that I complete my 
education here.

--Why?

--Well...I need to be ready to go wherever Our Lady sends me. To the 
missions in Central America, in Cameroon. Or perhaps simply teach school 
in Montreal, as Ste. Marguerite did. To do that...well, they don&#39;t speak 
Japanese in Africa. It&#39;s easier to learn French here than in Japan. 
Spanish and English too. And besides...

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked back at me, a happy look on her face.

--This is the city of Mary.

--The city of Mary?

--Yes. Ville-Marie. That is what Ste. Marguerite herself called it. If 
the Virgin wished me to sojourn a while in her favourite city, able to 
go pray at Bon-Secours whenever I pleased...well...even if I could, why 
would I have refused her? It&#39;s a privilege for me to be here.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se turned back to look towards the city and concluded:

--So I stayed with the sisters here in Montreal and finished high school 
here. Right now the plan is for me to get a teaching degree. I&#39;ll take 
my vows after that. So...

Sister Saori. That was Mother Superior&#39;s name.

--Your school in Musashino, I asked. I don&#39;t suppose it was Lillian 
Academy?

--Why, yes. You&#39;re a student there?

--Yes, I said.

--It is a small world! said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, brightening. Do you like it there?

--Yes, very much. Did you?

--I have many fond memories of the place...it&#39;s an excellent school, 
yes. Is Sister Saori well?

--Mother Superior? Yes, she is...it was she that you stayed with then?

--Yes...

--Shall I tell her you&#39;re well?

--If you like!...Actually, forgive me if this sounds odd, but...?

--Go on.

--I remember a hymn we often sang at Lillian, comparing Our Lady to the 
lily of the mountains...do you know it?

Maria-sama no kokoro
sore wa yamayuri
watashitachi mo hoshii
shiroi yamayuri

Her singing voice was like herself--unadorned, but clear, sincere, and 
oddly beautiful. I picked up the tune, and sang along with her, though 
not as well:

Maria-sama no kokoro
sore wa sapphire
watashitachi wo kazaru
hikaru sapphire

She smiled, and suddenly I couldn&#39;t help giggling, and she joined in. I 
had completely forgotten about the drizzle and cold. It wasn&#39;t just 
because of having company, or even having found yet another girl from 
Lillian Academy here, so far away from home--though that was true as 
well--but Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was somehow able to put me at ease and comfort, enough 
that I could sing together with her, a perfect stranger, without feeling 
at all embarrassed. A feeling I had nothing at all to fear.

Calm.

--Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? I asked.

--Yes?

--If you&#39;re not busy--I&#146;d like you to meet my friend that I&#39;m staying 
with in Montreal. My grande soeur, actually--her name is Sei Sato. Do 
you remember her?

--Ah!

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se seemed to have frozen, looking utterly thunderstruck. She held 
her breath a moment.

--Yes, she said at last. Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

--Is something wrong? I asked at last.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked down at the rosary on my wrist, as if noticing it for the 
first time. She pointed to it, her hand trembling just a little.

--Your rosary...may I look at it for a second?

--What?...of course, I don&#39;t see why not, I answered, moving to take it 
off.

--There&#39;s no need to take it off. Do you mind showing me your hand a 
moment?

I did not refuse, offering her my hand. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se took my wrist in her 
hand. I couldn&#39;t help but notice how amazingly light and soft her touch 
was just then, how perfectly formed and feminine the hand was.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked at my rosary a moment, saying softly, as much to herself 
as to me:

--I thought it looked familiar. But then I thought no, it was 
impossible...

She looked back up at me. I was afraid she would suddenly be jealous, 
but if she was jealous, I could not see it in her eyes at all. Rather a 
look of wonder, perhaps.

--You&#39;re Rosa Gigantea now? she asked at last, her voice shaking just a 
bit.

--Yes.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se let go of my arm. Her hand had begun to tremble just a bit.

--Shimako...when did you say you had to meet Sei for lunch?

--About 12:30. You do want to meet her? She has to know you&#39;re here, I 
added, smiling broadly, trying to reassure her. She&#39;ll be overjoyed to 
see you, I know she...

--I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.

--Why? Do you think she&#39;ll be angry?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se did not answer. She said instead:

--I really would like to talk some more, though, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se went on. With 
you.

About Sei? I wanted to ask. But that would have been an idiotic 
question.

--With me? I asked instead, not much more idiotic, I know.

--I have to run an errand, though. Will you come with me?

--Near here?

--On the metro it&#39;s not far. It won&#39;t take long. I&#39;ll have you back in 
time to meet her. We can talk on the metro, if you&#39;d like. Is it all 
right?

I did not refuse. I could not refuse.

Before me was the true likeness of Shiori Kubo.
