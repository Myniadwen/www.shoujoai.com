<pre>I might be changing the anime story a little in some detail here and 
there to better fit what I&#39;m writing, or just plain because I can&#39;t 
quite remember exactly how it goes &#150; haven&#39;t watched Marimite in a while 
now, and I&#39;ve never read the novels or the manga &#150; please bear with me.

------------------------------------------------

Shimako ran her hand across the rough bark of the old cherry tree with a 
smile of contemplative affection tugging at the corner of her lips. This 
beautiful tree, this lone sakura tree among the ginkgos, was so easily 
overlooked, especially now that no pink flower petals decorated its 
limbs as spring was already over. No, all that the casual passer-by 
would see of this tree now was dark green leaves and tiny buds that 
promised to become desirable fruit in due time. 

It was perhaps now, between seasons, that Shimako most identified with 
this tree she cherished so; singular and solitary it stood in the mass 
of its neighbours, yet so easily overlooked in a place where all trees 
were supposed to be the same. Perhaps she was being morose about it, but 
this tree always did feel like a good symbol for Shimako herself. 

That alone would have drawn Shimako to this tree, certainly, but it was 
not the reason this one cherry tree among many in the vast property that 
belonged to Lillian was so dear to her heart, oh no. It was underneath 
these sheltering branches that she had at long last been made the petite 
soeur of her beloved oneesama, the fickle Rosa Gigantea. 

Shimako had known and loved the rebellious member of the school&#39;s 
much-respected student council for a long time before Sei had ceased to 
keep her at arm&#39;s length to instead take her hand. Despite what others 
might think of her, Shimako had no illusions that Sei would ever have 
taken that step on her own, had not her well-meaning but meddlesome 
friends of the Rosa Chinensis family decided to act. No, as natural as 
her hand had felt in Sei&#39;s that day, Shimako knew well that Satou Sei 
would not have offered her rosary to Shimako, perhaps most of all 
because it felt natural to them both. 

Satou Sei was a complex woman, for all her brash flirtatiousness and 
devil-may-care attitude. How ironic that the woman that was considered 
the playboy of the school &#150; if such a term was appropriate for an 
all-girls&#39; school like Lillian &#150; and conquered hearts by the dozen it 
seemed, was the one whose own heart was the most guarded. Shimako had 
never asked her oneesama about the events that had taken place before 
Shimako&#39;s arrival to the school, with Sei&#39;s passionate and, ultimately, 
profoundly disastrous relationship with Kubo Shiori. Now that Shimako 
knew the gist of what had transpired through other sources &#150; Yumi and 
Yoshino &#150; she had gained a deeper insight into the woman she had loved 
so dearly. 

How doubly ironic, really, the strange way Shimako herself, Yumi and 
their two oneesamas Sei and Sachiko were interlaced after a fashion. 
Shimako knew that while Sei had not intended to make Shimako her petite 
soeur originally, Sachiko had indeed wanted her. Certainly, the proposal 
was undoubtedly performed strictly on Sachiko&#39;s own oneesama&#39;s 
directions, the respectable but ever-meddling Rosa Chinensis Mizuno 
Youko, but Sachiko had her own designs for Shimako. Sachiko had decided 
that Shimako had enough poise, discipline and grace to hold true the 
values of the Chinensis family... and Shimako had secretly been shocked 
at how little her friend knew her. Shimako was no Chinensis and never 
could have been, regardless of whom had held her heart back then. 

Then along came Yumi, sweet, clumsy and most of all kind-hearted 
Fukuzawa Yumi. Sachiko had harboured no intention of making the girl her 
petite soeur beforehand, in fact Shimako felt certain that the current 
Rosa Chinensis had at the time not even known of Yumi&#39;s existence, even 
though Yumi herself had carried quite a crush for the famous Yamayurikai 
member for quite some time. Pure chance and, in Shimako&#39;s eyes at least, 
a touch of selfishness on Sachiko&#39;s part had made Yumi Sachiko&#39;s petite 
soeur, but Sachiko would have propositioned any unattached girl that had 
stepped through that door that day. Sadly, Yumi had been level-headed 
enough to realise this... Shimako felt a stab of sympathy for her good 
friend. 

While Sachiko might have needed time to truly warm up to her unlikely 
petite soeur, Shimako&#39;s oneesama had adored the girl from day one. What 
it was, exactly, that drew the two together was anybody&#39;s guess &#150; 
although Shimako suspected that the way Yumi was absolutely open about 
her emotions for most part and seemed to lack any kind of basic 
duplicity might have appealed to her oneesama &#150; but not only did Sei get 
attached to the newest member of Yamayurikai, but she also quickly 
became irreplaceable in Yumi&#39;s own heart. Not that anyone could accuse 
Yumi of loving anyone other than her treasured oneesama Sachiko, but 
they all knew who Yumi wanted to run to whenever hurt or confused by 
Sachiko&#39;s words or actions. 

Shimako smiled to herself and traced a pattern in the bark of the tree. 

She had never been jealous of Yumi, in fact, Yumi was just too endearing 
a person to inspire any negative feelings for long. Instead Shimako had 
gained a surprisingly strong, and lasting, friendship in both her 
age-mates Yumi and Yoshino, the kind she would treasure for the rest of 
her life. Sometimes it amused Shimako to think of next school year, when 
she would be Rosa Gigantea for the second year in a row and Yumi and 
Yoshino would be Rosa Chinensis and Rosa Foetida, respectively. They 
were such close-knit unit, the three of them, and they would complement 
each other well... Yoshino was stubborn, fierce and hot-headed, while 
Yumi was tender-hearted and compassionate, perhaps also slightly 
traditionalist compared to Shimako and Yoshino. Shimako herself, well... 
she supposed she was something of a silent rebel, quiet, level-headed 
and observing of duty when it served her, but would go her own path 
regardless of opposition and let duty hang if it came to that. 

Then Shimako would feel guilty for thinking of such things. When the 
next school-year came around Yumi and Yoshino would know the pain of 
being parted from their beloved oneesamas, like Shimako herself had 
already been. It was not a pain to wish upon her dear friends, 
especially since she knew both girls loved their oneesamas deeply and 
sincerely. 

Involuntarily one hand reached under the sleeve of her uniform, fingers 
searching for the silver rosary of the Gigantea family that no longer 
rested there. 

Shimako had not been the only one to love Satou Sei, she knew that. If 
nothing else the whole Rosa Kanina fiasco had served to drive that point 
firmly home, made Shimako see the others that were suffering silently 
with unanswered love for her incorrigible oneesama. Briefly Shimako&#39;s 
thoughts touched on the dark eyes of Mizuno Youko and the old pain 
hidden in them. No, Shimako had been far from the only one to love Satou 
Sei. 

Not that it mattered, Sei had gleefully moved on, and although Shimako 
knew her oneesama attended school not far from Lillian itself, neither 
of them had sought the other out since the graduation. Yumi had, of 
course, and brought news to Shimako of her oneesama&#39;s new life, new 
haircut, and new friends. Shimako had accepted that the cut had been 
swift and clean, and tried in her own way to get on with life. What else 
was there for her to do? 

The pain had dulled with the knowledge, in time, that what was lost was 
something that had never been hers in the first place. 

The sombre mood lifted from Shimako&#39;s spirit somewhat, and she smiled 
again. 

Then something had happened that changed everything, right here, beside 
this very tree. Shimako had been standing there underneath the blossoms, 
deep in thought, when she had entered her life, oh so unexpectedly. 

Nijou Noriko. A newly transferred first-year, beautifully proper and 
demure at first glance- if one did not look into her dark eyes &#150; but 
giving her teachers and classmates a hard time with her unwillingness to 
comply with the many rules of Lillian she objected against. Not perhaps 
an open rebellion on her part, but a girl that stubbornly walked her own 
path regardless of what others might say or do. 

Not that Shimako knew all that then, at their first encounter. No, she 
had just looked away from the pink rain of petals to find herself 
suddenly no longer alone, and as she looked into those dark, astonished 
eyes there had been a small but earth-tilting... shift... within 
herself. 

They had met there often after that, beside this tree, during what 
Shimako secretly thought of as their courting phase. For anyone else it 
would have been innocuous enough, but Shimako knew there was 
something... something... going on with the way she would anticipate 
each meeting, and the joy seeing the slightly younger girl would bring. 
Her friends noticed as well, and history repeated itself somewhat: 
Shimako&#39;s hand was forced, and while not executed with as much grace or 
decorum as Shimako might have liked for Noriko, the silver rosary of the 
Gigantea now rested looped around Noriko&#39;s wrist. 

Noriko. The one that took one look at Shimako&#39;s offered heart, climbed 
inside and made herself at home there. The one whom Shimako could trust 
with all her secrets. 

She and Sei had been too much alike, Shimako realised as she felt sure 
Sei had before her. They respected each other so much it was impossible 
to ask, and neither of them whole enough inside to volunteer information 
on their own. Theirs was a silent understanding, but silence can only go 
so far. They both needed someone who would ask, who would see, who would 
reach out and touch when they did not know how. 

Noriko asked the questions, and accepted the answers. She did not speak 
to hear the sound of her own voice, but she was not one to keep silent 
either... and most of all she drew Shimako out, made her want to speak, 
to ask, to know... Shimako blushed slightly. Made her want to touch. 

A tiny gust of wind found its way between the trees to lift Shimako&#39;s 
long blonde curls and make the leaves of the cherry tree rustle above 
her. Shimako closed her eyes and enjoyed the sound with a smile. It was 
time now.  

Inside Shimako said her final goodbyes to Satou Sei and the lingering 
hold Sei had held on a tiny piece of her heart. Shimako had no regrets, 
and it was time... time to release herself to be free to love Noriko 
completely, with all of her heart... and Shimako would. The smile 
widened and the wind twirled around her briefly, and then it was gone. 

Something not quite a sound made Shimako turn around.  

There she was, more beautiful to Shimako&#39;s eyes than ever, dark eyes 
wide and open, plainly revealing admiration, respect, love and even a 
touch of desire, causing a delightful thrill to run down Shimako&#39;s 
spine. Shimako&#39;s own smoke-coloured ones darkened with a sudden and 
somewhat naughty image, and by the tilt of one surprised eyebrow, Noriko 
noticed. 

Shimako suppressed a sudden urge to giggle and beckoned Noriko to her. 
No more holding back, Shimako promised Noriko in her mind. She would 
give her everything, if only the dark-haired girl would have her. 

Then Noriko&#39;s warm, strong hand grasped her own, and they were standing 
close together. Shimako closed even that small distance to put her arms 
around Noriko&#39;s neck, causing the other girl to blush slightly before 
she tentatively put her own arms around Shimako&#39;s waist. Shimako stood a 
long moment merely looking deeply into Noriko&#39;s eyes, enjoying the swirl 
of strong emotions shown there, and the bubbling sense of happiness in 
her own heart. 

The words she had never spoken sprang to her lips oh so easily. 

&quot;I love you Noriko.&quot; 

The dark-haired girl gasped and her eyes brimmed with tears at the 
declaration, Noriko unable for a moment to reply. Shimako waited 
patiently, the smile still on her lips and her fingers idly playing 
through Noriko&#39;s almost shoulder-length hair. Finally she had her 
answer.
 
&quot;I love you too, Shimako.&quot; 

Throwing caution to the wind, not caring in the slightest if anyone 
should catch them kissing on school grounds, Shimako pressed her lips to 
Noriko&#39;s in a tentative first kiss that, amidst gasps and tiny sounds, 
escalated quickly until Shimako was pressed up against the bark of the 
cherry tree with Noriko&#39;s lips and tongue hot and hungry against her 
own. 

Shimako really, really loved that tree.</pre>
