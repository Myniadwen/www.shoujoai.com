<h1>Something to Believe (part 1 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a>

<pre>Although she wasn&#39;t an only child, Yumi was horrible at sharing. Mind 
you, it was just the important things that Yumi loathed to share. If you 
wanted to borrow a shirt, book, or even a little bit of money she was 
more than happy to accommodate you. But if it was something she truly 
loved and treasured? Her head would grow hot and her eyes would burn and 
she would seethe and seethe until what she loved was finally returned to 
her.

Such a thing had already been witnessed when her oneesama had appeared 
to be drifting away from her thanks to the attentions of Touko. She knew 
her behavior was childish and she hated it and herself at the time but 
all the same Yumi couldn&#39;t stop those feelings from rising up in her.

Ridiculous thoughts, honestly. Sachiko was a person, not a possession, 
and Yumi had no ownership rights over her. Particularly because those 
rights belonged to Suguru and the Ogasawara family.

Yumi loved Sachiko.

Yumi was in love with Sachiko.

And Yumi knew without the smallest bit of doubt that Sachiko returned 
those feelings. But it was like Youko had said in her first year when 
Yumi was watching her oneesama dance with awe and a flutter in her 
heart, Sachiko had serious eyes. She would do whatever her family asked 
of her. Even marrying a man who didn&#39;t love her and whom she could never 
really love. She would do it in hopes of pleasing her family, to keep 
their love.

Sachiko would marry Suguru and Yumi dreaded that day. With graduation 
approaching for the two Roses that wedding seemed to loom ever closer. 
She knew her oneesama attending Lillian University was a last minute 
delay tactic. Sachiko&#39;s attempt to give them as much time together as 
she could before she had to take that final inevitable step towards 
Suguru and her future with him.

A future without Yumi.

They couldn&#39;t play this game that Suguru had invented in his head. Where 
Sachiko goes out on his arm during the day and comes home to Yumi at 
night. Living a farce where they said one thing and meant another. It 
would kill them. They had to live honestly together or not at all.

Once the marriage happened they could be nothing more than friends.

It wasn&#39;t fair to her oneesama and Yumi railed against that future time 
and time again. Wanting to smash it with her fists and tear it apart 
limb from limb but that wasn&#39;t something Sachiko would allow Yumi to do. 
So what was left for her? She would be left behind and that precious 
thing she loved the most in the world, the one thing she would rather 
die than share, would be with another. And Yumi would be alone.

Then one day Sachiko mentioned with a sad but encouraging smile that 
Yumi needed a petite soeur and suddenly it became so clear. No one could 
replace her precious oneesama but perhaps, if she was very lucky, she 
could find someone to ease the loneliness she would feel at Sachiko&#39;s 
departure.

Part of her did find it all very ridiculous, these overdramatic feelings 
she was having. It wasn&#39;t as if Sachiko was dying or moving to some far 
off land. She would be right next door at Lillian University but Yumi 
knew despite the proximity of her oneesama things wouldn&#39;t be the same.

They simply couldn&#39;t. Not with the impending marriage hanging over their 
heads and that ever present knowledge that one day Sachiko couldn&#39;t be 
with Yumi as they were now.

The problem was finding a petite soeur was harder than one would 
actually think. After the utter disaster of the tea party and her 
subsequent dealings with Kanako she wondered if there was anyone truly 
meant for her other than Sachiko. That perhaps they were wrong and maybe 
they should play Suguru&#39;s game. After all, twisted and deceptive as it 
was they would still be together and wasn&#39;t that all that really 
mattered?

&quot;We wouldn&#39;t be happy,&quot; Sachiko murmured sadly, pushing stray locks of 
hair from Yumi&#39;s eyes. &quot;Perhaps we might be at first because we would be 
together but that could change over time. You could become resentful of 
the act I would be putting on with Suguru and I would hate myself for 
hurting you.&quot; Pulling her hand away and staring up at the glass ceiling 
to the greenhouse, Sachiko continued, &quot;I thought too much on what was 
ideal in a soeur, what was best for the Yamayurikai, when I chose 
Shimako and you know how that ended.&quot; Dropping her gaze, Sachiko offered 
Yumi a tender smile and caressed her cheek. &quot;When I chose you I thought 
of nothing but myself and what I truly wanted. And what I wanted most 
was you as my petite soeur. Listen to your heart and I promise it won&#39;t 
lead you astray. After all,&quot; Sachiko gave a light chuckle, &quot;it did bring 
you to me.&quot;

&quot;But oneesama,&quot; Yumi pleaded, reaching for Sachiko&#39;s hands. &quot;How will I 
know who is right for me? Who is really meant to be my petite soeur?&quot;

Blue eyes darkened sweetly and Sachiko ducked her head, her lips 
brushing lightly against Yumi&#39;s for a ghost of a kiss as she murmured, 
&quot;You&#39;ll know.&quot; Taking Yumi&#39;s hand in her own, she placed it over her 
heart. &quot;Because you&#39;ll feel it in your heart. How it warms at their 
presence, races at their smile, and grows fierce in your desire to 
protect them.&quot; Sachiko pressed her lips to Yumi&#39;s forehead and softly 
echoed her own words. &quot;You&#39;ll know.&quot;

Weeks went by and somehow Yumi found herself pulled from Sachiko&#39;s world 
and into Touko&#39;s. A world she once jealously thought to be so close to 
her oneesama&#39;s. But that wasn&#39;t true. Despite the difficulties Sachiko 
had at home thanks to the infidelities of her father and grandfather she 
knew her family loved her. Perhaps that was part of the reason she was 
so willing to give them what they wanted in terms of marrying Suguru. 
She wanted to return that love in whatever way she could, even if it had 
the potential to make her miserable in the future. Yes, Sachiko&#39;s family 
loved her and they gave her attention. Almost too much attention, if you 
asked Yumi. Going into every little detail of her oneesama&#39;s life and 
making it their own. Because she was one of them, an Ogasawara. It was a 
dangerous and suffocating sense of belonging. Yumi could well understand 
Sachiko&#39;s longing for both an escape and a desire to bury herself in her 
family&#39;s loving embrace and never leave.

However, Touko could hardly say the same.

Measure the amount of attention Sachiko received from her family and 
multiply by two then you would see how very little Touko mattered to 
those who bore her. She had been wandering when Yuuki found her, 
desperate not to return to the home that always seemed empty, despite 
the people occupying it. Unable to go to her clubs she loved so much 
because of their ability to keep her from that place, to keep her mind 
occupied, and to finally give her that feeling of belonging. Because of 
what? A misunderstanding, a petty argument, a clash of personalities. 
And suddenly Touko found herself sitting on Yumi&#39;s bed, held in Yumi&#39;s 
arms, and crying into the warmth of Yumi&#39;s embrace. It was then that 
Yumi understood what Sachiko meant when she said that she would know in 
her heart who was right for her. Because in that moment there was 
nothing Yumi wanted more than to ease the pain Touko was feeling. 
Nothing was as important to her as Touko and when she felt that, Yumi 
finally knew who her petite soeur was. Realizing this and holding Touko 
close to her, Yumi had been sorely tempted to offer her rosary. After 
all, despite the less than happy circumstances it was so very thrilling 
to finally know who she wanted. The problem was, Yumi wasn&#39;t so sure 
Touko wanted her.

In fact, there were times Yumi doubted Touko liked her very much. There 
had been more than a few instances of Touko saying she needed to work 
harder to live up her role as Rosa Chinesis en bouton. That she wasn&#39;t 
suited to someone as elegant and refined as Sachiko. At the time, Yumi 
had thought the words to be accurate if not a bit jealousy filled. 
Surely if Sachiko was the one that Touko wanted as a grande soeur then 
Yumi would hardly be good enough. While it had hurt so very badly in the 
past when she thought herself unworthy of Sachiko it was nothing 
compared to the thought she wasn&#39;t fit to be Touko&#39;s grande soeur.

There was only thing she could do. She would prove beyond any shadow of 
a doubt to Touko that she was the one meant to be her grande soeur. 
Showing her with not only words but with deeds how she would be not only 
a welcome presence in the other girl&#39;s life but a well desired one. The 
first thing Yumi did to prove this was to mend Touko&#39;s fractured 
relationship with the school drama club. A relatively easy matter once 
she got the members to understand Touko&#39;s caring heart was masked by a 
rather prickly exterior.

And then came the night of the Yamayurikai&#39;s Christmas party. Touko was 
hurting and she seemed so very far from Yumi. She ran after the younger 
girl and before she could stop herself, Yumi offered Touko her rosary. 
The world was absolutely still and Yumi felt a strange sort of peace 
when she took the rosary off, holding it aloft in the air in the small 
space between her and Touko. But then those horrible words came.

No, it wasn&#39;t the words that were horrible but rather the way they were 
said and that twist of Touko&#39;s mouth. The one that told Yumi she didn&#39;t 
believe this was something Yumi truly wanted. That she was offering her 
rosary out of sympathy not out of a genuine desire to have Touko as her 
petite soeur. When in reality it was the one thing Yumi wanted the most. 
She stood there, numb and hurting, watching as Touko ran from her, 
wondering if there was ever going to be anything she could do to get her 
to come back, to welcome her with open arms.

Touko ran from Yumi, so Yumi ran to Sachiko.

She knew she should stop leaning on her oneesama so much and Yumi had 
tried so very hard to keep her feelings of sadness in but Sachiko had 
known something was wrong. Hearing the kindness in her oneesama&#39;s voice, 
Yumi couldn&#39;t stop the story from spilling past her lips. How she 
offered Touko her rosary and with it, her heart, only to have them both 
rejected. Sachiko listened and she comforted and most of all, she had 
supportive but fierce words of wisdom and warfare to share.

There&#39;s no shame being rejected, the only shame comes from not trying. 
If Touko was who she wanted as her petite soeur she shouldn&#39;t give up. 
She should keep trying until Touko was finally hers. These words warmed 
Yumi&#39;s heart and she agreed strongly, then something in her broke and 
she was in Sachiko&#39;s arms. Releasing the pain of Touko&#39;s rejection 
through her tears, knowing that tomorrow she would have to try again.

Because for Yumi it was Touko or no one. There was no runner up, nobody 
waiting in the wings, it was Touko and only Touko. She was the one Yumi 
knew was meant to be her petite soeur. Even if it seemed Touko didn&#39;t 
quite know that herself. But she would soon learn. Especially if Yumi 
had anything to do with it.</pre>
