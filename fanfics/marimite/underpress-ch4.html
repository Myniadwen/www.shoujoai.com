<a href="../marimite/underpress-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Last chapter! Hope you enjoy. This one is for Estrea, jetflightgirl and

I hope it can live up to your expectations. Also, thanks to everyone 
else who has left feedback. I couldn&#39;t say how much it&#39;s appreciated.



The days passed slowly after Sachiko left, knowing that I was anxious 
not only to see her again, but to have Miyuki arrive. Finally today is 
the day, and I&#39;ve just arrived at the station to pick her up. Since 
tomorrow is Sachiko&#39;s party, I&#39;ve decided today would be a good day to 
show her around town and the school campus.

&quot;Shizuma!&quot; she calls out as she gets off her train, tossing her bag over 
her shoulder.

I&#39;m greeted with a firm hug, and return it with ease for the one person 
who has truly seen all sides of me. Formalities are exchanged with ease 
as we walk out of the station, her telling me about the ride up.

Luckily my apartment is not far off, so we head there first to drop off 
her bag and relax for a bit before going sight seeing. As I prepare some 
tea for us I can hear her rustling through my things so that she can 
ensure that I&#39;m &quot;living well&quot; as she puts it. &quot;Shizuma! Is this your new 
uniform? Put it on for me!&quot; she says with way too much excitement.

&quot;Really Miyuki? Why do you want to see me in this?&quot;

&quot;Because you owe me for meddling in your life and reccomending this 
school to you, that&#39;s why.&quot; She knows she has the argument won with 
that. It&#39;s true too. I do owe her, much more then I could ever repay 
her.

&quot;Alright, watch the tea and I&#39;ll go put it on.&quot; She does, so I go back 
to my room and put on my Lillian uniform, making sure to straighten it 
and tie my bow, just so. As soon as I walk out I hear her laughing.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You just look so... wholesome in that Shizuma. It hardly fits for a 
flirt like you,&quot; she manages to say between laughs.

&quot;It&#39;s better then the uniform for Miator! With those big puffy shoulders 
that make you look like an old lady!&quot; I try my best to defend myself, 
knowing that it&#39;s a lost cause. Not that I really want to win anyways.

Miyuki&#39;s smiling face is what I wanted to see after all. I have caused 
such a burden on her the last few years and never had I been able to pay 
her back, until now. I can&#39;t make up for the lack of gratitude I have 
shown her in the past, but I can make sure that from now on I make her 
laugh more then I make her worry.

And so the time passes, suddenly much too quickly, as we spend the day 
together walking around in the cold and catching up. Night comes and 
goes almost as fast, as if forcing me to face the one thing I didn&#39;t 
want to admit I was afraid of.

Meeting Sachiko&#39;s grande soeur.

Miyuki does her best to advise me throughout the day, just as she has 
always done. I wonder if Sachiko feels the same way over meeting Miyuki? 
My thoughts continue on as we get dressed for the party, the time 
ticking away just past six twenty-one.

&quot;Will you stop pacing Shizuma?&quot; she crosses her arms and leans against 
the wall as she gives me a look of warning.

I heed her words, once again, and go make some more tea just to keep my 
hands and mind busy. One of the things I love most about Miyuki is that 
she is the only person I can feel completely at peace with. She is the 
only one who has seen me cry, the only one who has held me as I fell 
apart and the only one who has unfortunately seen my anger.

After the tea is made I call a cab to pick us up, since neither of us 
drive. While we wait for it to arrive I sit down at the table with 
Miyuki and ask her for her reassurance once again. &quot;Do you think she 
would hate me?&quot;

She stares into her cup and thinks for a minute. &quot;I think she would want 
you to be happy,&quot; she says finally.

&quot;I still love her.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;Is it possible to love them both?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Do you hate me?&quot;

&quot;Never.&quot;

Her eyes are honest, and I know that she means it. I&#39;ve never figured 
out how she feels exactly, but sometimes I wish that she would find 
someone of her own. Someone besides me to take care of. Not because I 
don&#39;t want her to take care of me, but it&#39;s obvoious that I don&#39;t 
deserve to take up so much space in her heart.

The cab&#39;s horn starts making it&#39;s unpleasant noise so we drop our dishes 
in the sink before heading out, ready to trade in this year of pain for 
a year of happiness. For both of us. All of us.

----

&quot;Onee-sama what are you doing?&quot; I ask exasperated as I watch Youko 
mixing bottles of unknown alcohol together.

&quot;I&#39;ve always thought this would be fun,&quot; she replies, and I watch Yumi 
grow pale as she remembers the last time Youko thought mixing beverages 
together was fun.

The doorbell rings, stopping me from stealing the bottles away from 
Youko. Really, leave it to Sei to bring alcohol to a high school party. 
&quot;Youko&#39;s special blend!&quot; Sei calls out as I walk out of the room to 
answer the door.

&quot;Shizuma, you made it,&quot; I say as calmly as possible when I see her 
standing there. The urge to hug her is strong, though I fight it off as 
I notice her friend at her side. &quot;You must be Miyuki-san. Please, come 
in.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you, Sachiko-san. I&#39;ve heard a lot about you,&quot; she says as 
she walks into the house. I steal a glance at Shizuma who only gives me 
a helpless shrug as I guide them to the room the party is being held in.

&quot;It&#39;s already a bit crazy,&quot; I warn them. &quot;Youko has ben convinced by Sei 
that as college students they must prepare us for the &#39;parties of the 
future&#39; as she put it.&quot;

&quot;Try it Yumi!&quot; Youko encourages as we walk back into the room. She holds 
up a glass of the mystery punch as it has come to be known.

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll take care of you if you get sick,&quot; Sei adds as 
Yumi looks helplessly at me for aide.

&quot;Everyone please calm down. We have introductions to make. Miyuki-san, 
Shizuma-san, this is Youko onee-sama, and Satou Sei the former Rosa 
Gigantea and her partner, who also happens to be my petite soeur, 
Yumi-san. Onee-sama, Sei, this is Shizuma-san and Miyuki-san.&quot;

&quot;I think I may have picked the wrong person as my petite soeur!&quot; Youko 
exclaims as she notices the resemblance between herself and Miyuki.

I take a moment to catch my breath as they all greet each other, shocked 
as I look at onee-sama talking to Miyuki. &quot;Is it possible for them to 
look so much alike?&quot; I ask Yumi, who is also trying her best not to 
stare.

&quot;I think this calls for a drinking game!&quot; Sei chimes in as she throws 
her arm around Yumi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Who can drink the most and still tell 
them apart?&quot;

&quot;That sounds like it will be very painful in the morning,&quot; Rei&#39;s 
unexpected voice says behind me. I turn to greet her and Yoshino who 
have somehow snuck in without me noticing.

Shizuma thankfully steps up to make this round of introductions as I go 
to greet the last of my guests at the door. Thankfuly Shimako and Noriko 
are as calm as every, quietly joining the group as Miyuki gets an earful 
of names which I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t remember.

Sei of course is the first to turn on music, and I begin my rounds as 
social butterfly host. Everything seems to be going smoothly enough and 
I find that I&#39;m so busy worrying about everyone that watching Sei with 
Yumi isn&#39;t even bothering me. If it gets bad enough I&#39;m sure onee-sama 
will make it better with one of her concoctions.

&quot;Trying to avoid me?&quot; Shizuma asks as she finds my hand and takes it in 
her own.

&quot;Of course not. Just making sure everything is going ok for everyone.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a party. Of course it is. Just because it&#39;s at your house doesn&#39;t 
mean you can&#39;t enjoy it. Relax and have some fun right? I&#39;m sure 
Youko-sama would approve.&quot;

She points to the group and I notice Youko has let Sei start her silly 
drinking contest, against Rei of all people. I&#39;m not entirely sure that 
Youko hasn&#39;t started drinking as well. I suppose I could relax, for just 
tonight. She does have a point. These are friends, not socalites that I 
need to impress.

&quot;Help me collect keys so they don&#39;t do anything stupid and I promise 
I&#39;ll pay attention to you,&quot; I say, and she agrees. Everyone quickly 
hands over their keys, knowing that I have plenty of room for everyone 
to stay comfortably overnight. &quot;Will Miyuki-san be ok with staying the 
night?&quot;

We both glance over at her as she takes directions from Youko, standing 
side by side with her pacing away from Sei and Rei. &quot;I think she&#39;s made 
a new friend,&quot; Shizuma says.

&quot;They look like twins. It&#39;s frightening.&quot;

&quot;Yes. I think we were both shocked when we saw Youko-san. I didn&#39;t want 
to gape though so I tried my best to hide it.&quot;

&quot;Shall we join them?&quot;

&quot;In a minute,&quot; she says as she takes advantage of the distraction they 
are providing to pull me into a hug.

&quot;I missed you,&quot; I say honestly, allowing my guard to drop for just a 
moment.

&quot;Are you holding up ok with Yumi and Sei here?&quot; she asks as she releases 
me from her hug.

&quot;Honestly? I&#39;ve been so anxious for you to arrive it hasn&#39;t really 
bothered me. But now we must go pay attention to our friends before 
things get out of control.&quot;

As expected Rei was the loser of the guessing game, being the first to 
pick Miyuki and think it was Youko. Needless to say they were starting 
to get drunk, save for Shimako and Noriko. Yumi and Yoshino even giggled 
over a shared drink.

Miyuki and Youko hit it off right away, enjoying confusing the masses 
with their shared looks. Youko leads everyone through the night 
flawlessly with her natural ability to do so, making sure to keep us all 
engaged in some game or another.

Midnight comes quickly and I prepare champagne in glasses for everyone 
to toast with, adding non-alcoholic glasses for Shimako and Noriko. Once 
they are passed around I start the toast. &quot;To old and new friends.&quot;

&quot;To look alikes you never knew existed,&quot; Youko adds.

&quot;To love,&quot; Sei contributes.

I feel Shizuma&#39;s hand on my back, as if to comfort me without words. We 
count down to midnight and cheer, stoping in shock as we notice Youko 
bend down and peck Miyuki on the lips. &quot;It&#39;s tradition,&quot; she says smugly 
before sipping on her drink as if she hadn&#39;t just kissed a girl she only 
just met.

Of course everyone cheers, agreeing with the sentiment and kiss their 
partners. I can feel Shizuma watching me as I watch Sei kiss Yumi.

&quot;You ok?&quot; she asks quietly and I turn to face her.

&quot;Actually, yes. I&#39;ve just realized something,&quot; I say as I wrap my arms 
around her waist.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

She returns the embrace and once again I&#39;m lost in her green eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m ready to start the new year together with you.&quot;

&quot;Together?&quot;

I nod and she smiles as it sinks in.

&quot;I think I could handle that.&quot;

Finally, almost agonizingly softly I feel her lips touch mine in a brief 
kiss, too soon interrupted by the cheers of our friends.

&quot;Congatulations, onee-sama,&quot; Yumi offers as Shizuma and I break apart in 
shock.

&quot;For what?&quot; I ask, embarassed that they all just watched.

&quot;Realizing that you&#39;re human like the rest of us,&quot; Youko says, crossing 
across the room to hug me. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you, Sa-chan.&quot;

Shizuma takes my hand in hers as we return to the festivities, 
embarassment forgotten as I heard the words I&#39;ve always wanted to hear 
from Youko. I lean close to Shizuma as she talks to Miyuki who is still 
a shade of red after Youko&#39;s unexpected kiss. Even as she talks I can 
feel her hand holding me close, making sure that I know she is thinking 
of me.

I can&#39;t help but feel that this will finally be my year. No. This will 
be our year.



That&#39;s it! I hope everyone has at least enjoyed the story, even if they 
couple is a little odd. I tried to write it as best as I could, not 
rushing either Shizuma or Sachiko into a whole &quot;love&quot; situation so soon 
after everything they had been through. Nothing wrong with a whole lot 
of &quot;like&quot; is there? Of course the conversation about Sachiko&#39;s marriage 
always leaves room for more... It would be interesting to see Shizuma 
burst in on Sachiko&#39;s wedding and declare her love, but then, we&#39;ve seen 
that before haven&#39;t we?</pre>
