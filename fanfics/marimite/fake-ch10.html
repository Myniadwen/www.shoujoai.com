<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  Notes</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  familiar with Japan’s topography will forgive the fact that I have  altered it slightly to better fit my story. The error is not too  glaring, I think. What I have not changed is this: Suwa Lake is a  lake in Nagano prefecture, which old lore says the Gods used to cross  every year in winter.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  day” should be taken as the nearest translation to <em>Gokigenyou</em>.  (At least in spirit. Taken literally, it’s got quite a strange  translation, which, of course, even the Japanese don’t consider.)</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fifteen  thousand yen is approximately one hundred and fifty U.S. dollars.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With this  chapter, I officially break my White Reflection / It’s So Cowardly  fanon. No disappointments there. It just means I can actually end  this without saying, “And then, 10 years later, Yumi and Sachiko  have sex. The end.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>At this  rate, it can’t end.</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  probably don’t want it to end.</em></span></p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lodging,  13 KM </span></em>was a lot longer than Sachiko expected it to be.  Ordinarily, she would have chastised herself for being  impatient—after all, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">things will happen to you when the people  who decide say they will—</span></em>but the situation had changed  significantly.  After all, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">the people who decide </span></em>were still  back in Tokyo.  And unlike in Tokyo, out here, it seemed she had a  bladder, and a full one at that.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The car  emerged from a solid, two-sided wall of forest and what it emerged  into did not help Sachiko, either, for as soon as the lovely view of  brown and green vanished, she saw pure water, and lots of it.  Those  in the car who were not asleep woke up those who were, and the  general consensus was of a sort of awe which words could express, at  best only awkwardly, though Sachiko felt that she might want to try  in spite of this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was  no surprise, either. Sunset was just starting to extend its pink  claws over the horizon, and so every inch of water seemed to be  veritably lit afire, blazing with a kind of cool power that made  Sachiko feel very much as though one of the gods must have fallen  into this lake as it tried to cross, and so now blazed much like the  sun in its rage and frustration.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  lake is that?” Shimako asked quietly, her breath not quite caught  in her throat.   Sachiko already knew, and she felt the first twinge  of annoyance creep up her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lake  Suwa,” Sachiko said, feeling as breathless as Shimako sounded.  “Nagano Prefecture. Sei, would you like to tell us why we’re in  Nagano?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei only  laughed. “I never said we were going <em>straight </em>to Kyoto, did  I?”  She did not ask Sachiko, <em>is that a problem, </em>and so  Sachiko could not say anything in reply, and that was for the best.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  squeezed Sachiko’s hand. “It’s beautiful,” she said gently,  as though her voice were being held down simply by the raw power of  this lake-god. “I think this will be a wonderful place to spend the  night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  frowned, not allowing herself to be taken in by such a blatant,  inconvenient truth.  Something was niggling at the back of her head,  making her irritable, and she thought it probably had nothing to do  with her bladder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  squeezed her hand again. “Don’t worry,” she said with a little  grin that Sachiko couldn’t see. “It’s not far enough out of our  way to make anything go awry back home.” <em>Any more awry than it  already has.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  saying this was strange to Sachiko: It was as though as she spoke,  the little niggle in the back of her head began to subtitle her  words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as  soon as it spelled itself out in her head, it vanished. It was  absurd, after all. Wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of  course it is. You’re already </em>being bad. <em>What does it matter  if you take a few extra hours at it, or veer off the straight path?  Are they going to scold you twice for wasting gas? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Are  they going to scold me at all?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  gave that sharp little shake of her head again, and Yumi’s eyes  immediately became worried, though, again, Sachiko did not see it,  still staring out the window at the lake as they turned off onto a  road which probably curved all the way around it. <em>I have to not  think about that.  What’s the point of this if I do? What’s the  point of going out and doing something so abstract as just </em>enjoying <em>myself if I do nothing but worry about it the whole time?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  the voice of her mother: <em>That would be something I would expect to  hear from a reckless fifteen year old girl, wearing a short skirt and  showing her bare neck and riding in a flashy car with an eighteen  year old boy who wants nothing more than to get into that skirt and  what’s underneath. Is that you, Sachiko Ogasawara?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  found she had no response to that.  A blind denial would get her  nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re  slipping again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Often,  when Sachiko felt herself slipping, it was Yumi who managed to get  hold of her.  Yumi, who seemed so damn near psychic it was  frightening at times.  This time, it was Sei Satou, of all people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  she said, without preamble, “who thinks they can fit into a  swimsuit that’s measured to fit either myself or Yoshino without  falling out just as fast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”  Yumi said. “Wait, what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,”  Sei said. “There’s a lake, and the way it looks, <em>Lodging, 13  KM </em>is right on it.  Are we going to stay overnight at a hotel and <em>not </em>go swimming in the lake right next to it? Come on, no  chlorine for once!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think that that is what’s worrying Yumi,” Shimako said,  sounding plainly nervous herself, something Sachiko was unused to  from her. “The trouble is what you said about fitting into…a  bathing suit? Somebody else’s?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think,” Rei said from the middle seat, “that you and I, Shimako,  will be the only ones to be troubled. Yumi will probably fit soundly  into whatever Yoshino has, and I’m sure Sachiko and Sei are roughly  the same size.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Care  to enlighten me, Sachiko?” Sei shouted from the front. “What’re  your measurements?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wh—”  Sachiko sputtered. Sachiko never sputtered. Sachiko had also never  been openly asked what her three sizes were. Part of living in an  upscale community was that the horny, stupid boys of her circle  simply paid butlers off to find such things for them.  So while  Sachiko knew that such information might not be entirely private, to  be asked in the open like this, just…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was  scratching something on a spare scrap of paper she had likely found  under the seat with an old pen that looked like it needed to be  tossed.  Sachiko leaned in to look and Yumi turned her body to block  Sachiko’s vision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi,  what are you doing?” Sachiko said, her voice wary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  wait a moment, <em>Onee-sama,</em>” Yumi said.  When she finished  whatever she was doing, she folded the piece of paper in half and  handed it up to Yoshino, who flipped it open immediately after  receiving it and gave a long, slow whistle, the universal note which  meant something only mildly less vulgar than <em>hot damn</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yoshino!”  Yumi groaned. “You’re supposed to <em>pass </em>it! Pass!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am,” Yoshino said. “But can you blame me for looking? After all…”  she whistled again, and then passed the paper up to Shimako, who  watched it with interest as it approached. When it arrived in her  hands, however, she looked at it uncomfortably for a second, her face  working as she decided if she actually wanted to see what was inside.  After a few seconds, though, curiosity got the better of her and she  glanced at the quick scrawl, frowned, and then smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Shimako said, turning around in her seat to face Yumi. “I think  that’s about right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you two on about?” Quick as a pickpocket, Sei snatched the  scrap from Shimako, who went a dim shade of red almost as soon as she  lost it. Sei took a half-second to read it, and then gave a whistle  herself. “Those <em>are </em>pretty nice. Well done, Sachiko. We’ll  be able to fit you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama,</em>”  Shimako said mildly, recovering quickly, “they are almost exactly  the same as yours. I don’t believe that this makes something like <em>well-done </em>entirely appropriate”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  what?” Sachiko said, and then looked at Yumi, who took the  opportunity to go red as a beet.  “Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi,  her hands pressed between her legs hard enough that it seemed that  she was trying to leave her mark on the seat, muttered something that  sounded suspiciously like something Sachiko did <em>not </em>want to  hear Yumi saying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Most <em>definitely </em>not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” Sachiko said, a bit shaken.  “I don’t believe I  understood you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“</em>...<em>sizes…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  looked very closely at Yumi, trying to decide if she was joking;  really, she was just trying to convince herself that she was, though,  since she knew that Yumi wasn’t given to those kinds of jokes like  Sei was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  did she find that out, then? She certainly never asked me directly.  Did </em>she <em>pay off a butler?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  things always made Sachiko irate when the boys did them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Strangely,  though, Sachiko found that if she superimposed Yumi’s face on that  of <em>the boys,</em> instead of making her annoyed, it made her laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Made her <em>want </em>to laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It made  her laugh.  She covered her mouth with one hand and laughed into it,  and soon enough, Yumi was laughing, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  turned the van off into a gravelly parking lot, which was in front of  a fairly large, Japanese-style building. Attached was a small,  western-looking cube-shaped building labeled, <em>gift shop, </em>and  Sei said, “I bet we can all buy swimming suits there. Too bad,  though; I was looking forward to seeing Sachiko in one of mine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Onee-sama,</em>”  Shimako said quietly, “I think that that would be considered <em>perverted </em>in most polite circles” Rei snorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”  Sei mumbled as she stopped the van and they all filed out. (Neatly,  of course.)  “It’s not like I was going to sniff it afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  would believe that,” Shimako said as she walked up next to Sei, a  small smile on her face, “only when I found it in the wash.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  stopped, looked at Shimako completely agape for a second, and Sachiko  wondered at just how much the latter had come out of her shell in  this short time that they’d all been around each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  seemed like such an idyllic lady from across the Yamayurikai table.  How was I to know that she had this kind of side to her?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  speak about it like it’s a bad thing. Somebody who is a Lady all of  the time has no depth to them.  Manners are only one face of a  person. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  saw the wisdom in this, but she couldn’t accept it so easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  can I, when all my life, I have been told that without manners a Lady  is nothing but a bother?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Does  Shimako look like a bother to Sei?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  wound up chasing Shimako into the store.  It wasn’t very lady-like  at all.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
As it  turned out, the only sorts of swimsuits the little gift shop had  available were the sort that Sei would have liked to see Sachiko in.  Sachiko had been less than five seconds away from walking away from  the whole mess, utterly unwilling to expose that much of her body to  anybody, even a solitary cluster of close friends, when Yumi had  approached her, touched her hand, and said, “If you’re worried  about wasting the money, I can pay for it. I don’t mind buying  another.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This, of  course, had been so ridiculous that it had taken Sachiko a moment to  comprehend that this was not what Yumi had meant at all.  In fact,  the only people in the store who had <em>not </em>comprehended this  were the two behind the counter, who looked halfway past baffled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi <em>is  buying one? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I had  thought that…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  was smiling at her brightly. “We can match,” she said with a  grin. If Sei had a comment about Sachiko’s figure, she held it to  herself, pretending to browse around for bottles of suntan lotion  that she had no need for. The others did the same, apparently all on  the same wavelength for once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell kind of grande soeur am I if I have to be coddled like this  into the simplest of tasks by my petite soeur? It’s not as though  I’m going to strip in front of a crowd.<br />
  (fucking  slut that is exactly)<br />
  and  Yumi will be embarrassed beyond belief if she’s by herself.</em><br />
  (“<em>You  can’t do it. Who wants to look at that? You can’t do it. Even if  you </em>could <em>bring yourself to bear yourself in front of all  these people, they couldn’t bring themselves to look at—”)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  shook her head sharply at the memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she said quietly, her eyes downcast. “I’ll pay.”<br />
      <em>Who  the fuck wants to see that?<br />
        Who?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  was smiling up at Sachiko.  The smile said something more than  Sachiko had expected it to.<br />
      <em>Who?</em><br />
  She  didn’t know what it was, and what was worse, she wasn’t sure if  she liked it or not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  bought the swimming suit anyway.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  proprietor of the hotel was a woman in her mid fifties by looking at  her and her early thirties by speaking to her.  She greeted them with  a natural “Good day,” and gave a petite bow, which the girls  reciprocated out of sheer familiar habit. Sachiko thought it a little  unusual, but said nothing of it—there were, after all, polite women  outside of the Lillian School for Girls, no matter what opinion she  held privately.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even if  she <em>had </em>smiled at them as they stopped in front of the statue  of the Virgin Mary just inside of the hotel’s lobby to say a short  prayer. If Sachiko had seen more of the world, she might have thought  it a testament to her upbringing that she found nothing conspicuous  or strange about that statue’s placement in such a public place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  day,” Sei said, taking charge as she seemed oft to do as of late.  “If I asked you if you had three rooms right next to each other,  what would you tell me?” This earned her a disapproving look from  the lady behind the counter, who seemed to be slowly thinking of what  to say when another woman, only a couple years younger than the first  by her looks, walked out of a door behind the counter that was so  well-concealed that it took everybody by surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  would say,” this new woman said with a bright smile, “That our  rooms sleep two and cost fifteen thousand yen a night. And I would  also, as a courtesy, warn you that it is likely to rain in the next  few hours, and that there is a hotel down the road which costs half  of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  has no statue in the lobby,” the first woman added.  “I saw that  you stopped there. Are you all Catholic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  here I had thought that you wanted <em>me </em>to be on my best  behavior,” the second woman said. “That’s hardly a polite  question, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  simply thought—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  stepped forward, smiling inwardly and straight-faced outwardly at  what seemed very obviously to her a case of a sibling squabble. “We  are,” she said diplomatically, earning her the immediate attention  of both of the women. “We attend a Catholic school for girls in  Tokyo, and your statue caught our eye immediately by how beautifully  crafted it was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?”  The second woman nudged the first in the side. “I told you it was a  good investment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  first woman ignored her, giving a smile which Sachiko was certain was  forced, but only because she had seen it in the mirror a thousand  times. She put her own on and said, “In any event,” she winced,  wondering at how easily she had misstepped—<em>never dismiss what  somebody else has said so easily—</em>“we would love to stay here  for the night; this hotel is lovely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait  till you see the rooms to say that,” the second woman said, and  this time the first woman nudged the second in the side with a frown.  The second woman acted indignant.  “Hey now, I’m kidding. These  lovely ladies know that, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Sachiko said with her mirror-smile, and then began sifting  through her neatly-organized purse for her suddenly disorderly  wallet.  For just a moment, she caught the eye of the first woman,  and something funny happened, so fast that it took Sachiko until they  got to their rooms to understand it fully:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other woman’s smile became real.  And she nodded, just the tiniest  bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  they paid, the women introduced themselves as Satoi Tanaka and Kiyomi  Yoshida; Satoi was the more serious of the two, and the older.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  rooms were nicer than they had expected. There were bibles, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  never found time to glance inside of them, though.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It did  indeed begin raining, and much sooner than Kiyomi Yoshida had  predicted. The hotel had three floors (they were on the third) and  while the hallways were painted a beautiful, lavish white kept  utterly spotless, they also had no windows, so that when they all  arrived at their respective rooms—three doubles, all next to each  other—they were taken utterly by surprise as they looked out their  windows, which covered nearly the entirety of the walls which faced  the lake, and saw nothing but a fuzzy, grey image of the beach.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">While  all of them were surprised, none were alarmed, but all of them felt a  strange sense of sadness—they had all been looking forward to  swimming. Sei expressed a special sense of regret, citing that she  had been looking forward to seeing certain parts of Sachiko  emphasized which Sachiko did not think she would be able to name in  polite company.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko,  however, felt this odd sense of loss as well.  Certainly she had not  been looking <em>forward </em>to seeing<br />
      <em>(Yumi)</em><br />
  the  girls in their bathing suits—that sort of thing was<br />
  <em>(wrong)<br />
    (really?)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">not  something that she had ever really thought about—but she had been  looking forward to <em>something, </em>and she felt now a vague sense  of disappointment which, try as she might, she couldn’t place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  voice which came from her side was quiet, and, though Sachiko could  not have proven it, sounded a little bitter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  looked over at Yumi, a little surprised, though not upset as she  might have been had they been in public<br />
      <em>(you  are always in public slap her)<br />
        (slap  her)<br />
        You  may go straight to Hell if you think I’ll do that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and  said, “Were you looking forward to swimming?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  nodded and looked up at Sachiko, and a second later, there was a  small grin on her face. “I think I’ll go anyway, if you don’t  mind, <em>Onee-sama.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked, uncomprehending.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a great idea!” Sei said from behind them.  “Heck, we don’t even  need to swim. We can just stand out there and get soaked if the  lake’s too chilly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  then you can catch a cold,” Rei said disapprovingly, looking down  at Yoshino, whose eyes were already alight with the idea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whassamatter,”  Sei grinned at Rei, “Afraid you’ll get a couple too many points  across?” Her eyes traveled downwards for only the briefest instant,  just so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei went  bright red. Yoshino giggled. Shimako giggled as well, an act which  ruined utterly her attempt to look disapproving.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  am I even allowed in such a group? </em>Sachiko wondered. <em>These  girls…they’re all…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Normal.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yes,  that’s it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Normal.  Where does that leave me?<br />
  (slap  her)<br />
  (slap  them all they are all rude)</em><br />
  fuck<em> you<br />
    Easily  upset? Erratic? Irrational?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  going to change,” Yumi said. “<em>Onee-sama</em>, will you come  swimming with us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll  catch a cold. How can you even think of doing such a thing?”  Sachiko almost said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  she caught herself.  It was a mark of progress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at Rei, probably the one who was nearest to her, if not  closest.  Rei only shrugged</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at Sei, who winked at her and gave her a thumbs up which meant  many things that Sachiko did not entirely understand, and was not  certain she <em>wanted </em>to understand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked down at Yumi, who was smiling up at her with something in her  eyes that Sachiko had never seen before. She didn’t see Sei glance  down at Yumi and give a blink of something which was not quite  surprise, Sei who knew exactly what that <em>something </em>was. Sei  who seemed to know what<em> everything </em>was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  Sachiko nodded the most important nod of her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Soon  after that, everything they had done insofar, every silly little  rebellion, every little discomfort Sachiko had put up with, every  uncertain thought she had had, seemed to pale in Sachiko’s memory.</span></p>

It  happened while Yumi and Sachiko were changing in the hotel room,  neither of them bothering to go into the bathroom.  It happened so  fast that it took Sachiko longer than the incident itself to figure  out what the hell was going on.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  changed more slowly than Sachiko did, which might have been  surprising to somebody who didn’t know how quickly Sachiko had had  to change at<br />
      <em>(o-sake)<br />
        (have  some more)<br />
        (oh  dear ive spilled it down your dress let me clean that up)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">the  social functions hosted by her family.  She was fast enough, in fact,  that she hadn’t had time to think about how slowly some other girls  changed clothes.  She turned around when she finished, and a word was  about halfway out of her mouth when she saw Yumi naked for the first  time. The word might have sounded a little like “Wuh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi did  not see Sachiko see her naked.  Her back was turned (at Sachiko’s  unspoken behest) and so Sachiko saw only the barest outline of the  girl’s small breasts.  Yumi’s skin was very pale and delicate,  and Sachiko thought briefly that she looked a little like a doll.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A doll  with a very</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Beautiful<br />

  back,  her muscles and shoulder blades moving fluidly as the girl stepped  into her swimming suit.<br />
  <em>The  swimming suit that covers her<br />
    (fucking  sick)<br />
    very  small…shapely? Is that the word?<br />
    (god  is watching you filthy)<br />
    post  (disgusting) erior. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turned around again quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  surprised her, and scared her a little, was that she had to fight the  urge to glance back again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All at  once, Sachiko Ogasawara felt sick to her stomach, confused, and  afraid to the point that she began to shake, though she calmed  herself almost immediately thorough a force of will which was almost  routine at this point. She said nothing more to Yumi, whose face  brightened visibly when she turned around and saw Sachiko in her  bathing suit, which she said suited her very well, especially for a  purchase made on the spot. (Saying nothing of the extortion  involved.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  found she had trouble responding to that with anything but a grin  around the enormous lump that seemed to have nested into her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi and  Sachiko waited in the hallway, the first to finish. Rei and Yoshino  came second, and Shimako and Sei last.  Sachiko noticed that Shimako  was walking with a slightly faster gait than was usual, especially  for that girl, and that she looked a little red around her neck—a  less naïve person than Sachiko might not have wondered where on  earth the girl had gotten a sunburn. She might have thought something  more worldly had she seen the mildly shaken look on Sei’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  fell into line with Sachiko as they entered the lobby, earning themselves  looks from owners and travelers alike. Sei only waved, but Shimako,  still determined to walk a little ahead for some incomprehensible  reason, only sunburned further.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  going on?” Rei asked quietly as she pulled Sachiko to the back of  the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you mean?” Sachiko was honestly taken off guard, having been  distracted by the interaction, or lack thereof, between Sei and  Shimako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned. “I think you and I ought to have a talk,” she said, and  then she said something which delivered a hit like a semi truck to  Sachiko’s gut: “Did you even notice that you have looked at  Yumi’s backside no less than four times since we got on the  elevator?”</span></p>
