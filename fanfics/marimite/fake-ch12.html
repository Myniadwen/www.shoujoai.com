<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The<em> kamikaze </em>was  originally the name given to the storm which swept away both of the  Mongolian Kublai Kahn’s invasion fleets, first in 1274, and then in  1281. (In truth, this was largely due to the poor quality of the  seafaring craft they rode—flatbottomed boats meant for river travel and  the like).</span></p>

Fifteen  minutes after they had bolted out into the rain, whooping and yelling  and generally carrying on in a most unladylike manner, six upright  members of the Lillian Catholic School for Girls trouped triumphantly  into the lobby of the small hotel just off the coast of Lake Suwa, to  the applause and general merriment of the two co-owners. Shivering,  dripping, and thoroughly delighted, the girls, moving in pairs which  made sense to them but may not have made sense to the casual observer,  made their way to the counter, where they received their towels, which  had been mysteriously folded in their absence.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And?” Kiyomi asked as they dried themselves off as best they could  while standing in a public lobby and shivering. “How was it? Was it  worth the cold?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She received only a flurry of bright smiles in  response, amidst the furious motion of towels and the sound of water  hitting Satoi’s immaculately clean floor. Satoi winced but took no  action for the moment, though Kiyomi thought privately that she would  probably be at the tile with a rag the instant these lovely young  ladies returned to their rooms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi was watching something  else. Even through the act of drying her hair, an act which really  ought to occupy one’s full attention, the tall one, Sachiko, seemed to  be sneaking glances at the short one with the pigtails, whose name  Kiyomi could not remember for the life of her. It wasn’t something  inconspicuous, either—Kiyomi was observant, but not nosy. (Or, at  least, she didn’t think she was.) It was almost like…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s almost like the two of you, huh. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Huh. I wonder. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t wonder too</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(what the hell are the two of you doing in)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">much, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shaking her head sharply, she plastered a grin back on her face and watched the rest of them towel off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  heads and been dried and towels wrapped around chests, the group bowed  with a unison that was almost creepy and thanked Kiyomi and Satoi  again, their voices and language ever-so-polite. Sachiko excused them,  and they began to make their way towards the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Huh.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
They  sat in Sei’s room in an off-kilter little circle. Not contributing to  their cohesiveness was the early conquest by Sei and Yoshino (who had  become a little thicker since the car ride) of the quarter of the bed  encompassed by their makeshift geometry.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At first, they talked lightly amongst themselves.  Easy, noncommittal opinions on topics like the weather, how Shimako's <em>petite soeur </em>was  faring, and local politics, the most inconsequential of all, danced  back and forth between them and faded as quickly as they’d appeared.  Sometimes they talked in pairs, sometimes as a whole group. Their  voices never became loud enough to be heard in the hallway—this was,  after all, a gathering of Lillian student council members.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a while, Yoshino leaned towards Sei and started to whisper something  into her ear. Sei cut her off when she grabbed her about the belly and  flung her towards the bed. Yoshino shrieked then as Sei began to tickle  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko didn’t look at them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked at Shimako, who looked at the two with eyes that dropped something heavy and remorseful into Sachiko’s belly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a second or two, the tickling abruptly stopped. If Sachiko had been  looking at Sei closely, she might have seen her lock eyes with Shimako  for just a moment, and then look away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi saw that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  touched Sachiko’s hand, and Sachiko took it instinctively. Yumi’s grip  was momentarily painful, but relaxed significantly when Sachiko  returned the pressure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently, somewhere in that tussle,  Yoshino had gotten her message to Sei across, because when they sat up,  Sei looked around the room for a second, looked at the door, and then  at Yumi and Sachiko, spotted their hands clenched tightly together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She grinned. There was something in her grin that Sachiko didn’t like. Something hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko, would you be a dear and grab the cooler from the back of the van for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked. She supposed it would be unbelievably arrogant to be surprised  at being asked to do something as simple as that, but she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why <em>Onee-sama</em>?” Yumi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  closest to the door, of course,” Sei said. “And if we were to go with  the next-nearest, it would be a toss-up between you and Rei, and three  people can’t even fit around that tiny little cooler.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was very obviously a lie.  Sachiko didn’t like it. Yumi seemed to like it even less, but she said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go too,” Rei said. “Sachiko just got out of the hospital, Sei, so there’s no excuse not to send <em>somebody </em>with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can go,” Yumi said quickly, but Rei shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  all right,” Rei said. “You stick around here and try and keep that one  from taking her pants off before we get back, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After that, something happened which should not have happened, and something did not happen which desperately needed to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  object to that on the grounds that I was not wearing pants in the lake  and none of you complained,” was what Sei should have said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s because when you took off your pants to go swimming you were wearing something underneath them, <em>Onee-sama</em>,” is how Shimako ought to have replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Everybody needed to laugh just then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  Sei and Shimako looked away from each other, both having found (again)  that spot between the floor and the chest which is so utterly  engrossing to those who want to look anywhere but at you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, something nice happened: Yoshino intervened, and what might have rapidly degenerated into a very awkward <em>good night </em>became  something agreeable again. For it, all were grateful in their own ways,  for doing what they could not do themselves. And for it, much later,  after the rest of them went to sleep, Rei would hug Yoshino tightly  underneath the covers and whisper to her, <em>you did a good job. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  I count on you two to take your pants off when you return, then?”  Yoshino asked, looking first at Rei, then at Sachiko. “If you do, Yumi  might, and then I can show everybody the teddy bear I was telling you  about before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi jumped and reddened.  “<em>Teddy bear?</em>” she said, her voice terse. “Yoshino, you shouldn’t make things like that—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s true!” Yoshino continued, sitting up and grinning infectiously. “There’s even lace!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re making this up!” Yumi insisted. “How would you even know about something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know a lot of things about you, Yumi,” Yoshino said impishly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei gestured to Sachiko, and the two of them left the room together.</span></p>

“Coming  down for supplies?” Kiyomi asked as Sachiko and Rei entered the lobby.  Satoi was nowhere in sight; Sachiko thought that she might have gone to  bed, though the idea seemed mildly absurd to her. Where would she  sleep, after all?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In her house? They must have a house. They own a hotel; this much alone is enough to tell me that they are not poor. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It still seemed a little absurd to Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is that because Kiyomi is still here?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I think so.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think so,” Sachiko said. “In truth, we’re retrieving a cooler whose contents are a mystery to us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi raised an eyebrow and a grin both. “That sounds very exciting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  dangerous is what it is,” Rei said. The two of them stopped in front of  the desk. “When Sei Satou is involved, everything seems to be either  dangerous or unsavory.” She sounded honestly exasperated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not true, Rei,” Sachiko said, sounding like she only half-believed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi smiled. “She sounds like a woman I used to know during my high school days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  raised a skeptical eyebrow and Kiyomi added with an impish grin, “You  know, just before the Mongolian fleet was swept away by the <em>kamikaze</em>. Somewhere around then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  laughed politely, and Rei shook her head and sighed. Kiyomi laughed a  bit. “Apparently, my comedy routine has become outdated sometime  between then and now, as well,” she said with a smile that was more  infectious than it first seemed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did you end up doing with this friend?” Sachiko asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you wind up stringing her up?” Rei added helpfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heavens,  no. She’d never have permitted that,” Kiyomi said. “We just…sort of  went our separate ways after a while. Honestly, I think most of the  things she said were too honest for…” Kiyomi trailed off. “Whoops. I  said too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too much for a lady?” Sachiko said of a sudden,  and as she did, a preternatural silence seemed to drop over the lobby,  though it was, in truth, not a bit quieter than it had been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe it was because Kiyomi stopped breathing for a second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  have a friend like that, too,” Sachiko said. “Sometimes I wonder what  we would do if she was ever too honest for a lady. I think it might be  something as awful as going our separate ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi smiled a little. “It isn’t awful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Rei said. “I think it might be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  they walked out, Rei held Sachiko’s hand. Sachiko looked upset, but  only to the trained eye. It was the second time Kiyomi had seen her in  such a state that day, even if she had to look very closely to notice  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Such a well-trained lady, </em>Kiyomi thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Poor girl.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sachiko  had been so upset, in fact, that she had not stopped in front of the  statue of the Virgin Mary to pray, walking past it at a calm gait which  did nothing to reveal her tumultuous head.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sei isn’t honest. She’s rude, </em>she thought as she exited. <em>She takes delight in making others uncomfortable.  Whether or not she’s honest has nothing to do with it. Look at her choice of </em>petite soeur.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You promised yourself you would never think bitterly of Sei for that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  slid past the glass doors and into the cold rain, which stung Sachiko’s  skin. She barely felt it. She had barely felt Rei take her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  not being bitter. It’s the truth. Look at her. She chose Shimako, who  obviously has no interest in being anybody’s anything. She keeps  herself at such a distance, I’m amazed even Yumi was able to get close  to her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You</em> are <em>being bitter. If you had said that  out loud, Yumi would have been well in her rights to slap you. Who are  you, anyway, to know what Shimako has interest in?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>After  all, think about how she has looked. Something has happened, and you  know it, and you are an awful person for thinking poorly of her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But Sei is still not honest. She can’t be.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am  I going to have to let you run into the car to make you tell me what’s  on your mind?” Rei’s voice seemed to come out of nowhere, and Sachiko  stopped more out of instinct than anything else, and found that she  was, in fact, only a few steps away from slamming into their van. “Or  will you get in and have a talk with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko looked at Rei. “Is there something to talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  gave a little impish grin. “I should have let you hit the van.” She  pulled a set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the driver’s side  using the key. She pulled the door open, and used the electric lock to  open the driver’s side. “Hop in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are we driving somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  We’re going to get some food. The gift shop is closed, and I imagine  the coffee shop doesn’t sell a great deal of snacks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Snacks?”  Sachiko blinked. They had eaten dinner on the road—packaged food from a  convenience store they had raided on the way out of Tokyo—and she  didn’t feel particularly hungry. “Isn’t that what’s in the cooler?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  smiled again, a little more like an adult this time, and less like a  smart-ass imp, a title which she had soundly passed to Yoshino a long  time ago. “Sei is a clever girl, but she sometimes forgets the little  things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like snacks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you say  that to make a point, Rei?” Sachiko surprised herself in her  directness, but she supposed that she was surprising herself enough on  this trip already that that alone should seem almost normal to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. But from that, I think I’ve made a point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  want to hear something about Sei that will tell you…something. I don’t  know why, but it seems like her tiff with Shimako is having quite an  effect on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  either.” Rei started the car. “Buckle your seatbelt. I don’t drive as  stupidly as Sei does, but I’m in kind of a hurry, and it <em>is </em>pouring rain out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Sachiko nonetheless did as Rei had asked, and a moment later, they had pulled out into the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  delivering vital goods to Sei and Shimako. Sei’s sometimes not entirely  honest with herself, and when she’s like that, she does things that  people around her regret.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…You think that as well?” It took Sachiko a couple of seconds to get it out. A lesser woman might have stuttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  glanced in Sachiko’s direction. “You decided you weren’t going to be  troubled by that anymore.” Her voice was wary but concerned, that of an  old friend who knew of old troubles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what is this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m…not sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then, you shouldn’t let it trouble you, should you? If it’s not about <em>that</em>,  then it’s about matters which are none of your, or anybody else’s,  business. Sei will handle them on her own. She wouldn’t have it any  other way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that what makes her dishonest?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. If it was you, it would make <em>you </em>dishonest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How can she not…</em>want<em>…Shimako? If she’s honest with herself?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe she does. But maybe it’s something she has to take care of without anybody else. Even Shimako. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This seemed to Sachiko an incredibly sad thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  two of you were different people, last time I checked, you and Sei. I  don’t think you should worry about it. She has things that she wants,  and she has her own way of dealing with them. And you…” she smiled a  little. “I think you do, too. Ah, we’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ahead of them, a  small gas station and convenience store seemed to grow off of the  highway like a fungus. They pulled in, and Rei turned the car off.  &quot;Please stay in here. I’ll get soaked enough for the both of us,” she  said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, Sachiko was alone with herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s really none of our business. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That seems like such a strange idea.</em> <em>It  seemed like half of what we did on the student council was get involved  in each other’s lives; the Lord knows that Rei did her fair share of  that herself. And yet, here she is, telling me that we should let it  be, because it’s their business. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few seconds later, the  door opened again, and Rei popped in again, dripping wet, holding  several bags full of peanuts and dried seaweed. She looked down, trying  to find a decent place to stash them so that she didn’t step on them  when she drove, and as she did, Sachiko looked her. Looked at the long,  graceful line of her neck. Looked at the focus on her face—not  plastered on and held only by the utmost force and determination, but  natural. Calm. Confident. Looked at the calm brilliance in her dark  eyes, which in spite of their light no longer shimmered with youth and  energy as they once had—even though Rei had always been a contained  woman, there had been something there which was no longer so…blatant.  Sachiko looked at the way Rei adeptly nudged her hair—short enough not  to be able to tie back, but long enough to get in her face when it was  wet—out of her eyes, and tuck it behind her ear. “Would you hold this  for me, please?” she finally asked. “I don’t think I can put it  anywhere else.” She met Sachiko’s eyes and smiled gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, Sachiko felt something hit her full-on in her stomach, and a  thought occurred to her which she would not have expected from herself  in a million years:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Did Rei…grow up?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was more  mature now, that was certain—that was natural. She was older. But there  was more to it than that: She seemed utterly…comfortable. As though she  knew where the boundaries of ladyship and friendship lay, and how to  easily tread them, and that holding one’s spot rigidly was simply the  quickest path to the mental ward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You say these things, and yet you do not believe them. It is as though somebody has said them to you and then followed up with, </em>you’ll understand when you’re older.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But I </em>am <em>older.  I’m in college now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then you’re old enough to know that anybody who needs to assert that still has growing to do.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It scared her.  But more than that, it saddened her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko?” Rei’s hand was on Sachiko’s cheek, her voice concerned. “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re crying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  felt her mind begin to sink into the blind haze which sometimes  accompanied this strange sort of grief, and in the midst of that said,  for once, exactly what was on her mind. “You’re growing. You…left me  behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei tensed for a minute, and then relaxed and smiled.  “I’m not an adult yet,” she said. “None of us are. I think I’m mature  enough to admit that, but that’s all I can really hold to.” She removed  her hand and instead took Sachiko’s in her own. Sachiko found that  Rei’s hand was wet, and for some reason, this seemed strange to her.  “Nobody’s leaving anybody behind, but we all change, Sachiko. We all  grow. We only leave people behind if we grow into carelessness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t.” Sachiko sniffled a little, doing her best to make it as unnoticeable as possible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei handed her a tissue which she took from a little niche in her door. “You either. The hardest thing is not to leave your <em>petite soeur </em>behind, I think. Eriko told me that, and she was certainly right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hardly ever see Eriko anymore,” Sachiko said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smiled. “I see her plenty. She calls me so often that I wonder if she actually has schoolwork.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This made Sachiko almost unbearably happy, all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad,” she said.</span></p>

When  they returned to the hotel, Rei showed Sachiko what was in the cooler  so that she wouldn’t lose her expression when she saw it in the hotel  room. Sheltered by the trunk of the van, Rei lifted the top of the  cooler and showed Sachiko the single largest collection of beer that  Sachiko had ever seen. (In fairness, the only time she was really  exposed to alcohol was at her family’s parties, and people who attended  those preferred to drink themselves to death out of fancy martini  glasses rather than bottles.) For some reason, the first thing that  came to mind when Sachiko saw this was not, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Will we die if we drink all this? </span></em>but rather, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">there’s no wine. </span></em>Sachiko and beer did not mix well.  Surely it could not be good for her stomach.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s why we brought food,” Rei said, reading her mind. “You’ll be  eating before you touch a drop. I got this while I was in there, too.”  From her jacket pocket, Rei pulled a pair of packages of bread. “Eat  well and you’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko only blinked. “How…what is all of this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  alcohol, and a lot of it. I think Sei and Yoshino both had their minds  set on something like this. It’s mostly for you, but it’s also for Sei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For…me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei  would say that you need to relax some. I agree with that, but I'm not  certain I agree with her methods. I am, however, pretty sure that it  wouldn’t be a good time to argue with her about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is this safe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smiled, and for a spare moment, Sachiko saw a heart-achingly nostalgic impishness in it. <em>(funny, it didn’t make your chest wrench fifteen minutes ago)</em> “I’ll make sure none of you do anything stupid. I might have one or  two, but I don’t like beer that much.&quot; Rei shook her head, sending  water everywhere. &quot;I think Sei would tell you to relax, and that  wouldn’t be too bad of an idea right now. I think we're probably going  to wind up drinking most everything in here, and you don’t slip out of  your shell a little bit, you’ll wind up on the floor sobbing about your  cat or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds like something Sei would say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the truth. Have you ever seen an uptight drunk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko had, and now that she thought about it, Rei was absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so, it seemed wrong to her. The idea of drinking to get drunk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wrong, but familiar. What else did the rich and bored do with their time?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m not bored.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But you are rich.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I won’t be like them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then relax. </em>Oddly enough, not Sei’s voice.  Yumi’s. <em>Part of growing up is learning how to relax and be on your guard at once. It’s called being “careful.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Sachiko said. “I’ll be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And if you can’t, I’ll be careful for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko smiled.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Six</span></strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Satoi  knew something was wrong the moment Sachiko walked in the door. She had  just woken up from her nap, and called the night staffer—whom she had  woken up, but who had promised to be there in ten minutes—and begun to  gather her things from the front desk when Sachiko and Rei walked in.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse me,” Kiyomi said, practically before she had thought about it. “Miss Ogasawara.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi stared at her. She and Rei stopped, and Sachiko said, “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Could I ask for a few minutes of your time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re being absurd, </em>Kiyomi thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Even so. I want to know. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because it feels lonely sometimes?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because it feels lonely sometimes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Sachiko said with an agreeable smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  so easily approachable. Even when a stranger asks for a minute of her  time, she doesn’t seem perturbed in the least; only happy to oblige. So  well-trained. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Poor girl.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi caught the girl’s eye, and a moment later, Sachiko said to Rei, “You can go on ahead of me. I’ll only be a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei met Sachiko’s eye, and then nodded. She privately marveled at how Sachiko could go from being so open and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(human) </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">very nearly unguarded to being so ladylike in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  half minute later, the elevator doors closed and it was just Sachiko,  Kiyomi, and Satoi in the lobby. Sachiko, who had looked at Rei until  she could no longer see her, turned back to the two owners.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  she said pleasantly. “What can I do for you, Miss Tanaka, Miss  Yoshida?” Though her voice was light, her face was ambivalent; she  looked to Kiyomi very much like a girl who knew her way around other  people, and who was prepared in equal parts for confrontation and  conversation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is that being </em>careful? Kiyomi thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Indeed,”  Satoi said, also facing Kiyomi, “What can I do for you, Miss Yoshida?”  Her voice was not annoyed, but it was a near thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Satoi,” Kiyomi said, “Miss Ogasawara, would you join me for a cup of coffee?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi  narrowed her eyes. “You can say what you’re going to say here, or you  can wait for the night staff to arrive. It’s not as if there’s anybody  around to listen in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Satoi, please don’t be so suspicious.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi  sighed. “All right, then,” she said, and then, completely to the  surprise (though not shock) of both of the other women, she took  Satoi’s hand and pulled her close, gently. Satoi allowed herself to be  led, and her face went from near-annoyance to concern in half a second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, Kiyomi?” she asked, immediately putting her hand on Kiyomi’s  cheek and moving the woman’s face to look at her. Kiyomi pulled away  gently, and Sachiko thought that it might be a lover’s kind of pull—the  kind of pull that you had to take great care with, so that you neither  appeared to jerk out of the other’s grasp nor to ask to be let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just let me talk, Satoi,” Kiyomi said, and looked back at Sachiko. “Miss Ogasawara—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko held up a hand. <em>(never interrupt) </em>“Sachiko  is fine,” she said, her own face creasing with a concern that made  Kiyomi’s throat want to constrict. How else could she react to such  immediate kindness from a near stranger?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It reminded Kiyomi of something she had been told long ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just because you are troubled, does not mean anybody has to give a damn.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A </em>real <em>lady  or gentleman will, though; indeed, that is the true mark of such a  person. That’s what they’ll never teach you there, ever, because they  know you can’t teach kindness or</em> true <em>character.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said you were from Tokyo,” Kiyomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s correct. I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going towards Kyoto?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most  people don’t come here bound for anywhere save Kyoto or this very lake,  and you only took out a room for the night, so I thought so. But you’re  traveling with a cadre of girls. At <em>your </em>age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyomi,” Satoi said sharply, “if you’re upset, then by all means, please tell us, but don’t be rude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Sachiko said. “It’s all right. May I ask what you are insinuating, Miss Yoshida?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,”  Kiyomi said. “Please, don’t take this the wrong way. I’m just…” She  shook her head hard. “Sachiko, are you a student of the Lillian School  for Girls?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi blinked. Sachiko did not. “I was, but I have since graduated. How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  stopped to pray at the Virgin Mary statue like it was a part of your  routine. You are very close with a girl who looks younger than you,  rather than the girls who are your age, which suggests to me that she’s  your <em>petite soeur.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean Yumi,” Sachiko said, and  something about the way she said it gave Kiyomi the courage to keep  going, even though she knew without even looking that Satoi was ten  seconds away from simply taking her out back, strangling her, and  dumping her body in the lake at high tide. Kiyomi was being rude to a  customer, of all people. Kiyomi that <em>she </em>taught to be polite, always. “That’s right.” <em>Always always </em>always <em>be unfalteringly polite.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Except when it’s only the two of you, isn’t that right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyomi,” Satoi said with a hint of warning in her voice.  “What are you getting at?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi looked at Satoi. “How did you feel when we left, Satoi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi’s  eyes widened a little, but she covered it well. “That was in the  seventies, Kiyomi,” she said. “I can’t remember something that far  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can,” Kiyomi said. “And you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko said,  “Is there something amiss here that I should be aware of? If the two of  you are having some sort of difficulty, I would be happy to act as—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,” Kiyomi interrupted, holding up a hand. “I apologize for interrupting you, but please let me take this at my own pace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Answer my question, please, Satoi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think this is a discussion best left for—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please.” There was something in Kiyomi’s eyes that resembled a plea, though Kiyomi never pled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi looked at Sachiko, who only looked back, her eyes saying nothing, and Satoi thought, <em>That  girl has been well-trained. Not a hint of curiosity, morbid or  otherwise, shows in her eyes, even though by all rights it should,  since she knows by now that this will pertain to her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Poor girl.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi sighed. “I felt awful,” she said. “And I felt relieved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satoi narrowed her eyes. “Is it necessary to say—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do not interrupt people, Kiyomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry, <em>Onee-sama.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko’s eyes widened, as did Satoi’s.  Satoi’s, however, then turned regretful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you, Kiyomi.” She put her hand on Kiyomi’s head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi smiled back as best she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I felt that there was nobody left in that school who we could trust. I  felt that after the…events occurred at the Yamayurikai, that if anybody  had caught the two of us so much as holding hands, we would have been  driven out, and violently. It was not a good time to be Catholic  and…what we were.” After a moment, “Are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is a good enough time now that you can say it outright, <em>Onee-sama.</em>” Kiyomi’s voice had an edge to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a pause which was half angry and half something which Sachiko could not place, Satoi said, “Homosexual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  blinked this time. The idea certainly was not anything new nor stunning  to her—especially not after today. It simply seemed like too strong of  a coincidence to her to be anything short of a divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi  turned back to Sachiko. “When we left, I was honestly ready to be rid  of that place. I was disgusted with the way they treated us, and with  the way it was so easily overlooked by the administration and by the  other members of the Yamayurikai. The way that hatred and disgust was  so tied up with a place which I loved and cherished for eleven years  is…” she shook her head. “Hard to take sometimes. Sometimes I feel as  though the only good thing to come out of it was meeting Satoi, but  when I do, the memories of the fun I had there, and of the friends I  made, force me to regret, and badly.” Kiyomi was crying—rather, tears  were running down her face, which was utterly impassive as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko thought, <em>She  has been well-trained. This must be incredibly painful for her, and yet  she won’t allow herself to break her expression around somebody she is  not intimate with, even as she tries to cast off Lillian.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Poor girl.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko said, gently, “What did you need from me, Kiyomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi looked her straight in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do they treat you and Miss Fukuzawa well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko’s breath froze in her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Relax.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just be careful. Be Rei.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No, don’t. Be you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  still…working on that particular issue,” she said slowly. “With myself.  There is, though, somebody else in my group who I think could share a  few insights with you. If you like, I can ask her to speak with you  tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kiyomi looked at Satoi, and then at Sachiko, breathless, and then said, “I would like that very much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko smiled and bowed slightly. “I’ll do that, then. But…I can tell you one thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko felt nervous for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, not nervous. Anxious. Scared. This was important, so it was a little scary, even if she'd never admit it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  are the Yamayurikai from the past three years, in bits and pieces,” she  said as warmly as she could. “And Sei is a very important woman to us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though  they hadn’t memorized all of the names of the group yet, Kiyomi knew  exactly what Sachiko was saying, and this time, both she and Satoi  smiled, looking near to tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad,” Kiyomi said. “Thank you very much, Miss Ogasawara.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko is fine,” Sachiko said, and then she bowed excused herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  drink too much,” Satoi called after her, surprising her. Though her  face didn’t show it, Satoi could tell anyway. “Nothing sounds quite  like beer bottles clanking together. It was almost like the cooler was  toasting itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This seemed halfway philosophical, but Sachiko  got the feeling that if she were to present it to a class, she might be  laughed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On the elevator, she caught her breath. Though it  had left her exhausted, it had left her happy, too, to be part of  somebody else’s life and troubles, not because she was trying to look  out for them, but because she was invited.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It felt nice to help, and not simply to interfere, for a change.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe you’ll grow up, too. Maybe you already have a little—maybe that’s why Rei can still talk to you like she does. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In any event, maybe you’ll slip out a little bit. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko found herself looking forward to the night.</span></p>
