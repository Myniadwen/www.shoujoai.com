<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Come into  my lair, said the spider to the fly, and read the third (and final?)  part of It’s So Cowardly, known to me as Fugainaiya (inspired by  the song—one is just a translation of the other).</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Compared  to the others, this one is LONG. Grab yourself a seat and a beer,  because you might be here a while.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As always,  thanks for reading!</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ryukyu is  an old name for a string of islands off of Japan (and belonging to  the Japanese government) including Okinawa and ending with Taiwan.  (Which, of course, does not belong to Japan). Yumi is working on her  History major at this point. Tokyo University is one of the leading  research Universities in Japan (so entrance into the school is no  mean feat) and has five campuses: Hongo, Komaba, Kashiwa, Shirokane,  and Nakano. Those familiar with Japan’s tollway system will, again,  forgive whatever errors I make.</span></p>

Solitude,  Endo Kunikuda thought, could do funny things to a person’s brain.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endo had  met Satou Sei only once before tonight, at a bar not far from here.  She had been half-drunk at the time and well on her way to full-out.  He had been alone then, and he’d put a fair amount of booze into  his system by that point, though nowhere near enough to inebriate  him, a fair wine cellar unto himself—just enough to give him that  little bit of extra bravery that sober people somehow always seemed  to confuse with stupidity and drunken arrogance.  He had, in truth,  been drinking off a nasty breakup, (the next day he would wind up  drinking off a nasty hangover <em>and </em>a nasty breakup, though he  didn’t know it at the time) and she had been hanging out with a  group of women.  They had been laughing with her in the way that good  friends did, but she had been laughing with them in the way <em>he </em>did  when he was going for the proverbial female jugular; he had  recognized it immediately, but he had been “brave” enough to  ignore it entirely. She had seemed to him at that point almost  masculine in the way she treated the two girls with her, and he had  “bravely” ignored that too. Sei’s departure from his table was  the first time he had bothered to go back and carefully examine that  fuzzy memory, and he would later rationalize it by saying that he had  earlier that night watched a refreshing bout of bisexual porn, which  had apparently gone to his head more than the booze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  night, Endo had been isolated.  Alone, the world had seemed a far  scarier place to him, though that could have just as easily been the  alcohol.  The truth was, Endo was frequently isolated; it was simply  a fact of his life.  Endo worked quite a bit to support what he  called his University Habit, and when he wasn’t at class or work,  he was usually sleeping.  He found perhaps one or two nights a week  to have fun with his friends, and then they usually insisted he get  drunk with them.  He did not like alcohol nearly so much as it  seemed, but he liked <em>them, </em>and he thought that in spite of the  fact that they did not think of him as much more than a drinking  buddy, (though one or two of the girls, he thought, might have the  hots for him—but he often thought that about women) if he lost  them, he would be quite poorly off.  Solitude did funny things to a  person’s brain; even solitude in the middle of a crowd of friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  on this last bit that Endo devoted most of his thought.  He had felt  it before, of course, though not often—that funny little feeling  when everybody around you is having fun, and they think you are too,  when in reality you’re miserable.  It could be due to something bad  in your life that you hadn’t told anybody about—a dead cat, a  failed grade, a fresh breakup—or simply because nobody was really  paying any attention to you.  But that kind of solitude, Endo  thought, was nearly maddening.  It created in you a deep, hollow  insecurity: <em>Are these people really my friends? How can they be?  They’re not even seeing me at all.  Doesn’t that mean that  they’re lying to me? </em>After a while, that little thought evolved  into more complex machinations—how many of your “friends” are  actually lying to you? Or even worse, in a way, how many have you  simply misinterpreted? <em>Oh, I’m sorry, </em>they could be saying, <em>did you think that I cared about you? I’m sorry if I sent off  that signal, but in truth you’re really just a drinking buddy—a  good guy, somebody to talk to if I need a perking up or a laugh,  since you’ve got a nice sense of humor.  I like you well enough,  but please keep yourself to yourself, okay? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  sort of solitude did no ambiguous “funny things” to a person’s  head, Endo thought. It simply drove you mad, honest and surely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ten  seconds after Sei stood up and left, the waiter set her beer down at  her spot. He set Endo’s wine down in his.  He vanished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fifteen  seconds after Sei stood up and left, Endo decided that his wine  tasted like shit.  He really did have lousy taste in wines.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Twenty  seconds later, he had taken a deep drought from Sei’s beer, which  tasted a little like horse piss (she had poor taste in beer, he  thought).  He felt a little braver.  Maybe brave enough to do what he  thought he maybe had to do. He took another drought to ensure that  his voice could attain the necessary obnoxious power he would need,  and then he stood up too. He could just barely see Sei’s head  retreating towards the bar attached to the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This, he  thought dimly, was one of those things that he would probably be  embarrassed about later.  He wasn’t drunk enough to forget it—he  was only a little buzzed, in fact, since he could hold his liquor  well enough (though not as well as he thought he could)—but that  was alright.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei!”  he called, and the restaurant mostly lost its dim, humming voice. The  girl turned around and faced him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, Endo?” she said gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those  two friends of yours, the first time I met you,” he said loudly,  intending his voice to match her gentleness but failing unwittingly.  “What happened to them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  left,” she said. He could not interpret her voice, save for the  hesitation before the answer. Maybe that was interpretation enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They  left.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endo  Kunikuda sat down.  Then he stood up again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call  me sometime, will you?” he shouted. “I won’t leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled at him, and for the first time all night, that Sei that he  remembered—the shit-eating, wry, impish girl that he had drunkenly  fallen in love with (and subsequently basically forgotten the next  morning) one night long ago—appeared before him. “Don’t get too  many stupid ideas, sailor,” she said. “You wind up paying for  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scurvy,”  he agreed, mildly aware that he had no idea what the word meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  laughed, mildly aware that Endo had no idea what the word meant, and  said, “Okay. I’ll call you sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she  vanished. He sat back down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Scurvy.   That’s just scurvy. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endo  Kunikuda rather enjoyed being right. He thought that maybe Sei would  be grateful to him for catching on, though he was disappointed to  note that it would not get him any nearer the inside of her pants:  Because he knew that he was right, he knew she played for the other  team.  Too bad. She <em>was </em>pretty hot.  He started thinking up a  few excuses to make to his guy friends about why he did a plain miss  tonight, thinking that if he said it straight-out—<em>She’s a  lesbian, I had no chance—</em>they’d probably just laugh at him,  citing the same counter-argument that he had cited to himself earlier  that night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But he  was right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She did.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Six</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I say  hello / you say hello</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
If Endo  Kunikuda had not caught on, had not stood and shouted, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">hey, Sei, I  understand how you feel, and I’ll be your friend, </span></em>Sei may have  not even approached Yumi Fukuzawa that night.  The instant she saw  the girl’s face, she knew that in the state she had driven here in,  she would not have been strong enough, brave enough to do what <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">she </span></em>had to do.  Feeling shitty for herself, feeling as though the  world were simply a big fat phony, questioning every single damnable  thing that was said to her and keeping it all to her own stupid  fucking self, she would only have made Yumi worse that night.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because,  she thought, that was exactly what Yumi was doing.  Sitting in front  of the counter, the girl nursed a small glass of <em>something, </em>and  that was about all she did—Sei saw none of Yumi’s usual radiance  tonight.  The bar remained dim, lifeless, whereas Sei might have  expected it to suddenly be as bright as a candle with that happy,  expressive girl inside of it. Her hair was down, a state that Sei had  only previously seen her in when she slept. She wore a jacket and  jeans, and sneakers. She was not dressed to go out and have a good  time—she looked like a girl who was dressed such that if she woke  up the next morning naked and uncertain of where she was, her clothes  would have been no great loss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">However,  something about the way Endo had said what he said had perked her up;  she had spent most of the evening miserable; not simply afraid as she  had been telling herself. She had even been happy, a little, when he  had caught onto her. Fear had been part of the equation, of course,  but solitude did funny things to a person’s brain, she knew; the  worst part of it was that solitude, especially solitude in the midst  of a crowd, was devious—it didn’t let you say, <em>hey, you’re  lonely, </em>because there were twenty-odd people around you that  called themselves your friends.  Sei was, after all, not a fearful  person.  She was, however, human, and solitude took its due toll on  her as it did on everybody. She only briefly considered this before  deciding that she did not give a flying batshit.  She could deal with  introspective horsepiss later.  For now…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  gathered up her courage.  She found that she felt herself needing it.   She had not seen Yumi in over a year—not since the young girl had  gone off to University.   They had not parted on bad terms, but Sei  had found that as Yumi aged, she became less and less tolerant of  Sei’s teasing. Save for one odd time when the girl had responded, <em>(and oh, how she had responded), </em>by Yumi’s senior year at  Lillian, Sei had more often than not found herself teasing a brick  wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  wondered now how she should approach Yumi even as she did.  Should  she buy her a drink? Say something to make her smile? Say something  traditional like, <em>may I sit here? </em>(The last one did not at all  seem to fit her, but given the mood of her evening, it didn’t seem  entirely inappropriate).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  considered this so hard that by the time she reached Yumi, who still  had not noticed her, she hadn’t thought of a single thing. So,  following the advice of thousands of dating sages the world over, she  simply sat on the stool next to her, uninvited, and said, “Hi,  Yumi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  jerked in shock and turned her head so fast that Sei thought it might  break clean off. “Y-you!” she sputtered. “You scared me!” Her  face was pulled up in an expression of shock, and, oddly enough, of  relief. Was it possible to be both at once? <em>Apparently.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was easy,” Sei said with a grin, finding her old mannerisms  returning to her seamlessly, in sharp contrast to how she’d been  with Kunikuda earlier in the evening. Even so, she still felt a  strain somewhere near her core—she was still tired, still stressed,  still afraid.  She thought she had probably failed in her original  mission unless she could call Kunikuda and ask him to spread around  that they’d had sex or something equally stupid; that tugged one  way at her.  She thought that Yumi might simply ask her to leave,  that the young, vibrant girl had simply become so tired of her face  that she would send her away; that tugged at her another way.  It  was, all things considered, all Sei could do to keep her expression,  but damned if she couldn’t at least do that. “How are you, Yumi?”  Yumi’s expression clouded briefly but intensely, the look of  somebody who was trying to cry and smile all at once, and Sei, who  would think a millisecond later that she had overreacted and a minute  and a half later that she hadn’t, said,  “Hey,” her voice  serious of a sudden, “are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking  back on it, Sei realized that this was probably the worst thing she  could have said to Yumi, even if she couldn’t have helped it,  couldn’t have known.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Are  you okay </em>is a funny little expression.  With few exceptions, the  people who hear this phrase are largely the people who are, in fact,  visibly not okay. There are varying degrees of <em>visible—</em>just  as a lover of many years may pick out signs of being <em>not okay </em>more  easily than a friend from work, some people might broadcast signs of  being <em>not okay </em>more or more often than others.  For example…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>For  example, if this were Sachiko, I wouldn’t even get a straight  answer. </em>As it was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other funny little thing about <em>are you okay </em>is this, and it is  for the first time now that Sei realizes it: As soon as somebody asks  a distraught person if they are okay, they are not. It is the <em>open  sesame </em>of the proverbial floodgates, and all the person’s  carefully constructed barriers come crashing down, all at once.  It  is a well-meaning reminder that the person is not well, and it is the  utmost of sympathies, because asking this of a distraught person is  an invitation to become a shoulder to cry on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As it  was, Yumi’s floodgates had been nearly broken anyway; it was almost  a mercy to give them that last little kick.  The first tears came  slowly, discreetly, working their not-quite-parallel ways down Yumi’s  cheeks like spies, trying desperately to blend in with her nearly  invisible makeup.  She stared at Sei for a moment through watery  eyes, and Sei thought she saw something like a smile pass over the  girl’s lips, and all at once she understood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yumi  did not lock up because she found me annoying.  Not at all. </em>Sei  did not know why she <em>had </em>become such a brick wall, but it  didn’t matter.  She could guess, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  Yumi broke down.  Tears flooded down her cheeks as her chest heaved  powerfully, in and out, drawing breath just barely fast enough to  keep her going. She hung her head, sobbing powerfully but quietly,  (they were, after all, in public, and a Lady did not sob in public,  Sei thought angrily) and after a moment, Sei put her hand on Yumi’s  head, already moist with sweat from the exertion —crying full-force  was a tiring event. She bent her head down close to Yumi’s, and  whispered, “Come on, Yumi. Let’s get you somewhere less public  and drunken, ‘kay?”  The only place that really came to mind was  the ladies’ room—that bastion of solitude and sisterhood that the  likes of Kunikuda and the obviously perturbed bartender could only  guess at.  Even so, it was better than bawling in public.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And, of  course, it was more private.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seven</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Let’s  take the unknown path to the sky.</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  bathroom fit with the rest of the restaurant, in that it was  western-themed.  It bore six stalls and a short line of sinks in  front of a giant mirror that made Sei think of the interrogation  rooms in some of the crime dramas she’d seen on television; the  stall at the end was larger, for the handicapped, and it was there  that Sei took Yumi, still shaking violently, though no longer  sobbing.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sliding  the lock shut, Sei plopped Yumi down on the toilet seat and squatted  next to her. The girl was so short that even like this, Sei came  easily up to her badly-shaking chest <em>with both hands clutched  against it like a grieving nun or a widow or </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gently,  Sei took one of Yumi’s hands from her chest and pressed it between  her own breasts, squeezing the tiny thing gently.  After a second,  Yumi’s fingers tightened around Sei’s, and for a second, the two  of them stayed there like that, neither moving so much as a muscle.  Even their breathing quieted, and for a moment, there was pure  silence in the bathroom that Sei would later remember so fondly and  bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then Sei  looked up and met Yumi’s eyes, finding the girl already staring  down at her, as though expecting something.  Sei wasn’t really  certain what it was, so she gave to her the first thing that came to  mind: A smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi,  Yumi,” she said for the second time that evening. “How are you?”  Her voice was clean and confident, the Sei that Yumi was used to  (and, though she didn’t know it, the Sei that Yumi needed to hear).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  managed a brave smile—those who can only manage a brave smile are  usually holding on by the skin of their teeth and bravery as it is,  and Yumi was no exception.  “Hi, Sei,” she said, and Sei took a  moment to marvel at the girl’s voice; even trembling as it was, she  could hear how it had grown in the span of only a year, and for a  moment, Sei felt an unforgiving wave of nostalgia wash over her.  “I’ve done better.” Her voice cracked, and Sei saw tears  stinging at the edges of her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei  stood up, and pulled Yumi up with her.  For a moment, neither was  sure what was going on, until Sei pulled the girl into her arms; a  strong,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>loving</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">comforting  grip</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>for  both of us</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and  gave her the shoulder she so desperately needed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  funny thing about shoulders, though, is that by the time we have  them, we rarely need them anymore. Usually, just having one is  enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi  stayed there for a minute anyway; they were warm together, and for  just that one little minute, they were both happy. Sei no longer had  problems at school; was no longer concerned about failing her  upper-level mathematics class, was no longer afraid of the women she  lived with, of their small minds and long reaches.  Was no longer  afraid of Endo Kunikuda, (in a small, then-insignificant part of her  mind, she resolved to call him back within a week or two).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as  for Yumi:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  gone,” Yumi murmured, and Sei had an idea or two what she was  talking about.  “She’s been gone for a year. This is our one-year <em>she’s-gone </em>anniversary.”As she said this, the  strangest little rhyme appeared in Sei’s head, one that she’d  learned as a child</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(all-gone all-gone  cattail fish is all-gone, ne’er seen again / where to where to into  the sea its so blue; now we start again)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and then vanished just  as easily, a stubborn cattail that her mind could not entirely wrap  around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where did she go?”  Sei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kyoto,” she said.  “Away from here. It might as well have been Ryukyu.” <em>The  point is that she left, not where she went. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Sei  asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,”  Yumi said. “I think she was running away from me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt that,”  Sei said, patting Yumi’s head. “I don’t think she would ever do  that, Yumi.” <em>It was probably her family. It was probably Suguru.  I’ll have that motherfucking bastard’s head on a stick. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why…”  Yumi’s voice caught. “Why the hell did she have to leave?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei couldn’t think  of anything to say to that, which was probably bad, because Yumi kept  going, which was definitely bad. Already, she was starting to fumble  words, something Sei hadn’t heard her do in years.  “All I wanted  w-was to go to school with her…so that we wouldn’t have to be  apart. I was going to tell her, Sei, did you know that? I was going  to tell her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell her what?”  Sei asked gently, dreading the answer. She hated herself for it, but  her stomach sank; she thought well of herself, though, for not  allowing any stray thoughts</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>i can be there for  you</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>she wont</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">to pass through  her head. Refusing to let that small little animal in the pit of her  stomach pass to her brain, to niggle at her, to tell her <em>now’s  your chance. All these years, waiting and teasing and now’s your  shot.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi’s voice was  little more than a whisper now; perhaps that was the loudest she  could bear to say it. Sei thought it dreadfully sad that this was the  first time she <em>could </em>say it, and it was not to the one she  meant it for.  She thought she was okay with that, and yet each word  still drilled a hole in her gut:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I was going to tell  her I’m in love with her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>each<br />
  fucking<br />
  word</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei grimaced  and forced her head clear. Refusing to give in; forcing herself to  let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just wanted to be  near her. Even if she would have refused me, I wanted to be near her.  It’s the—” Yumi’s breath caught, and Sei stroked her hair,  waiting for the girl to regain herself.  “It’s the winter now.  I  wanted to just sit with her near a heater and look out at the snow.  We did that once, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Sei  said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So then…” Yumi  let a slow, long, shaky breath out.  “Why was that too much to ask?  Was I too selfish even wanting <em>that?</em> Was I being selfish? Was  I being—” Sei cut her off, pressing her harder into her breast.  At some point, it didn’t help to repeat oneself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh,” she  whispered.  “You weren’t, Yumi. Sometimes, just…” <em>All you  have to say is “sometimes, some things just aren’t meant to be,  and we have to take what’s in front of us.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei opened her mouth  to say this. <em> Sometimes, we just have to let ourselves accept what  we can’t ha</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>look who the fuck  is talking.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This hurt worse  than Yumi’s confession, because it stung deeper than her heart: It  stung her pride.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes,”  she murmured. “We lose things we want for a while.  Sometimes they  just come back a little later on.” <em>What the fuck are you doing?  This isn’t how </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>shut up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did she  leave, Sei?” Yumi said, pulling away from her finally. When Sei got  a look at her, she smiled. She looked awful, as was to be expected of  a girl who had expertly made up her face, only to cry most of what  she’d applied out onto another girl’s blouse. (Which,  incidentally, Sei didn’t give a damn about.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ask her yourself,”  Sei said.  “She has a phone. She has a place of residence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei smiled at her, and  it clicked as fast for her as the truth about Yumi had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko did not  leave town to get away from you, Yumi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi looked up at her  then, and her eyes were almost pleading.  “How do you know?” she  sounded almost agitated. <em>Mm. She looks agitated as well. Excellent  observation, Ryuzaki. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei said, “Why did  you stop responding to me at the end of your last year in school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s…” Yumi  looked away.  “It wasn’t that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That you didn’t  like me. You just had something else you needed to do first, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi nodded mutely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko has  something she needs to do first. If she’s got a little tunnel  vision, you have to respect that, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…she  just…left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So just go find  her. You’re not in school every day. Even Universities have  breaks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi nodded then—the  nod of a person who is done hearing advice, whether she has accepted  it or not. She pressed her face back into Sei’s blouse, and Sei  smiled gently, bringing her own face down to rest on the top of the  girl’s head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She really does  look pretty with her hair down.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stayed  like that for a long time. People entered the restroom, did their  business, and left.  The toilet flushed and people sat and stood,  pulled panties up and down, clattered around in heels and sneakers.  Hands were washed, makeup applied, bad dates avoided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All of this happened  purely <em>around </em>the entity that was Sei and Yumi, embracing  tightly, each needing the other more than they would ever admit. Each  feeling their own little insecurities and fears, each moving past  them in their own way, and yet in the same way: By embracing the  warmth that the other presented. Yumi knew nothing of Sei’s  problems, and yet Sei thought she knew more of them than she let on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s moved on.  She’s grown up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s still here.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s very  lonely,” Sei whispered finally. “Isn’t it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is,” Yumi  whispered.  “It’s hard. It’s painful, and it’s…cowardly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s <em>so </em>cowardly,” Sei agreed. She knew how the girl felt; knew all the  urges, all the impulses, just to be cowardly and stupid and let the  pain sag and wash over her all at once; to shelter herself in it.  Knew how often she let herself wash away.  Knew how often Yumi did  too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Knew how hard Yumi’s  heart beat against her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Knew how hard Yumi  sometimes was to understand.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was<em> so </em>cowardly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If it’s cowardly,  I think it’s the kind of cowardly we can both live with. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei moved away from  Yumi, at once regretting the loss of the girl’s warmth. “Yumi,”  she said, looking straight into the girl’s eyes, whatever the urge  to look away, to blush, to ignore the jackhammer of her own pulse,  the feeling in Yumi’s hands of a similar heartbeat. “Do you think  yourself a coward?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes,” Yumi  admitted. “I don’t think it can be helped, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too,” Sei  said, and then pulled her close and kissed her.  Yumi hesitated only  for a moment, and then kissed her back, using one hand to pull Sei’s  head close. Yumi was clumsy with her mouth—this was not her first  kiss, but it was certainly among them—but Sei, experienced in ways  she would probably never admit to anybody, did not mind.  They kissed  like that for a small while that seemed to Sei to span an indefinite  period of time; tongueless, almost sisterly if not for the passion  radiating from both them and the intimacy of the kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They broke off, and  Sei looked at Yumi, determined to be as straightforward with her as  she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi,” she said.  “I...” Sei never had trouble speaking.  “I really, really like  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know you do,”  Yumi said with a gentle, tender smile. “I really like you too,  but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Sei  said, feeling her poor, abused stomach take yet another hit. “If  you don’t…you know. I can give you a ride home. I’m sober.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi considered for a  moment that seemed like a year in hell to Sei, and then nodded.  “Please, take me home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei refused to let her  gaze drop.  However much she<br />
      <em>wanted</em><br />
  liked<br />
  <em>loved</em><br />
  Yumi, this was  not about sex. This was about getting Yumi what Yumi needed; not  about getting what Sei wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It seemed nearly  impossible.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eight</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s so difficult.  I hate it.</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Endo was actually  still in the restaurant when they left, and Sei actually took a  moment to go to him on their way out. She left Yumi at the door and  nearly ran up to him. When he looked up at her, it was with a mix of  drunken hope and pleasant oblivion.  He had obviously been indulging  himself.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey there, Sei,”  he said as coherently as he could manage.  “Did you find what you  were lookin’ for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did. I just  wanted to say thank you,” Sei said.  She put her hand on his  shoulder, and then, thinking herself extraordinarily affable, patted  it in a manner that Endo would have expected from a guy-friend  consoling him about this very evening.  It made him grimace, an  expression Sei thought to mean that he was about to vomit.  She had  no idea what a gaffe she’d made, though it didn’t particularly  matter, since he wouldn’t remember it come the next day anyway.  “So…thank you.” She patted him again, and then turned and  walked back to Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that  about?” Yumi asked when she returned, a little bewildered. She was  obviously not used to seeing Sei speaking with men pleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He’s a friend.  Call him a buddy, I guess.” Sei found herself unable to be too  disappointed—Yumi was perking up too, and when Yumi was perky, Sei  was perky.  It was simply unavoidable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their walk back to the  car was silent, but it seemed that as soon as they shut the door,  Yumi began to talk.  She talked about airy, oblivious things: The  classes she was taking at the University; how Yuuki was doing, her  roommate’s annoying habit of showing up at three in the morning,  half-naked and all-drunk.  Useless things that made Sei smile  nonetheless. She avoided the subject at hand, and Sei avoided it with  her, and it was cowardly but relieving.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi continued in that  fashion until Sei asked her where she lived, about a block from the  tollway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…” Yumi  frowned a little sheepishly. “I live over on the Tokyo University  campus…the one in Nakano.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei’s eyes widened.  “Woah. Tokyo U? Christ, Yumi. You did well for yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Took the lord’s  name in vain…” Yumi murmured a little more sheepishly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei grinned in spite  of herself. “Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei got back on the  tollway, dropping the small deposit in the little change basin  without much thought.  They were silent for a minute, and Sei  realized all too late that this meant that Yumi was thinking, which  meant that their time speaking airily was through, a passing which  Sei lamented more than she cared to admit. “I’ll just get onto  route 4; that should drop us right—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you ever  consider sleeping with Shimako?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei shut her mouth,  and then sighed, needing no time to consider “No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I loved Shimako,  but differently. I’d sleep with her, but only if she wanted to, or  needed to, and it wouldn’t be for love.  Shimako is a strong girl;  if she wanted something like that, she’d have come to me for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve always  taken that attitude towards her. Did you ever worry…” Yumi’s  breath caught a little.  “Did you ever worry that maybe you judged  her wrong? That she was just shy?” <em>Or worse, cowardly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope,” Sei  smiled. “I didn’t judge her wrong. Besides, I think she’s  straight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too. The two of  us were close, but we weren’t near, Yumi. If you asked me, I  couldn’t name you her favorite color.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Could you name  mine?” Yumi asked this hesitantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time it was Sei’s  turn to be sheepish. “Probably not; it was a bad example.”  Then,  after a moment, “If I had to guess, though, I’d put you as a pink  girl. Or white.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Such a strange  thing, having white as one’s favorite color.  White is none of the  colors at all—it refracts every single one of them. Is that the  ultimate in indecisiveness?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  like that,” Yumi smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The point is that  Shimako and I weren’t…like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were we?” It  sounded like a rebuke, and Sei thought it might have been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Sei  whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be,” Yumi  smiled. “I’m not. I think I’m making a point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Making a point. Did  she ever </em>make a point <em>like this when I knew her last?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,  then,” Sei said wryly. “Don’t hold yourself back on my  account.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi paused, and then  laughed, and Sei was glad to hear it: “You know, I don’t know  entirely what it is.  I guess if I made it, you got it better than I  did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei considered for a  moment, and then decided she had.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nine / fin</span></strong><br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s so cowardly.</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The last thing Yumi  asked Sei before they arrived at her dorm, which was remarkably close  once Sei dropped onto National Route Four, was this:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you tease  me and not Shimako?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei smiled easily at  this.  “You were more fun to tease, Yumi.” And then, before Yumi  could open her mouth to chastise her for spitting bullshit, she  continued: “Besides, I think you wanted to be teased. Shimako  didn’t. Shimako wanted me to support her from somewhere behind her;  I was her stunt net, but she never fell while I was there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei pulled up near the  curb in front of a large, old building. “You’re here, kiddo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi didn’t move, so  Sei seized this one last opportunity, suddenly afraid that she would  never get to ask this if she didn’t do it now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you ask me  so many questions about Shimako?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess…” Yumi  smiled a little. “I guess in a lot of ways, I felt as though I was  your <em>petite soeur, </em>too. I guess I just wanted to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei smiled at her.  “Satisfied?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Satisfied.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi opened the car  door. The chill air stung Sei’s flesh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess…I’ll  see you around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you will,”  Sei said. “If you need anything, call me. You’ve still got my  phone number; it hasn’t changed. Unless, of course, you deleted  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei reached around and  gave Yumi a quick, deep hug, which Yumi gladly returned. Sei made  sure to savor the scent of this girl whom she cared about so deeply,  in her heart thinking that this was perhaps the last time she would  ever smell it so closely, if at all, and wanting it to make a nice,  firm dent in her brain if this was the case.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then Yumi left. She  shut the car door gently but firmly behind her and began to trudge up  the snow. Sei felt the pit in the bottom of her stomach expand,  threatening to suck the car in with it, but she held her face steady  in case Yumi happened to look back. There was a little snow on the  ground, but Yumi didn’t slip on it, and Sei thought this a mark of  how the girl had truly grown for some reason (though she had rarely  slipped before, either—certainly no more than a normal girl, though  Lillian’s graduates were by no means normal girls).   Sei made up  her mind to wait until Yumi was safely in her dorm before she  left—she did not, she reasoned, want her to get locked out and  freeze to death.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was a quarter of  the way up the walk. Sei’s breath became a little harder to draw.  Her head ached very vaguely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was a third of  the way up the walk.  Sei felt her chest tremble a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was a half of the  way up the walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was  three-quarters up. <em>Maybe I should leave now. She’s got to have a  key, so there’s really no point in me st</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi stopped, and in  spite of the way her exit had seemed to drag on into infinity, her  return took no time at all. Sei rolled down the window when she  approached, but Yumi ignored her, walking around to the other side,  opening the door, and taking a seat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I always thought,”  Yumi said quietly, “that Shimako was stupid. For not getting close  to you when she had the chance. Even with <em>Onee-sama </em>around, I  would sometimes think that. I never wished I could be her, but I  always wished she would take advantage of what she had near her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei said nothing. She  could think of nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose…I  suppose I would be stupid for not taking advantage of what I have  near me while it’s here, either.  If it’ll be gone tomorrow, then  I should…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not going  anywhere, Yumi,” Sei said, trying to sound reassuring, and Yumi  laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If your night were  still up to me,” Yumi said, “I think that would have cost you it.  I’ve never known you to…to misstep like that before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei, who had refused  to see, looked, her smile fading.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She saw that Yumi was  breathing hard. Saw that her eyes flickered between Sei’s eyes and  her lips. Saw the little…spark? Was that it?...of adulthood in the  girl’s face. Saw that Yumi was bolder and stronger than Sei was,  and yet just as cowardly. <em>Aren’t we all cowardly at heart, after  all? All of us Ladies and Gentlemen, just (all-gone all-gone cattail  fish is all-gone, ne’er seen again) big fat scaredy-cats? (where to  where to into the sea its so blue; now we start again)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei wanted to  kiss Yumi again desperately—wanted to savor the feeling of the  girl’s soft lips again; wanted to feel the heat (not simply warmth)  radiating off of her again.  Wanted to<br />
      <em>touch<br />
        lick</em><br />
  have her head  drawn back into Yumi’s delicate, insistent arms again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She did not, however.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I Shimako,  then?” Yumi said, and then Sei understood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Sei said,  and then she kissed Yumi a second time.  She savored the feeling of  the girl’s soft lips again; felt the heat radiating off of her face  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She touched. Her hand  was hesitant at first, moving towards Yumi’s breast, touching,  squeezing; it was useless. She felt only the soft padding of a bra.  She slipped her hand under Yumi’s jacket, onto the smooth, soft  skin of her belly, and went upward from there, only encouraged by the  small shiver Yumi gave in reply. When she came upon it, she slid her  hand under Yumi’s bra and caressed her, stroking, savoring the  hardness which mixed so well with the softness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She lifted the shirt  slightly and broke the kiss. She licked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi gently pressed  her hand and head away. Sei refused to allow herself to look hurt,  but didn’t have to try after a moment, when Yumi said simply, “Not  here. My dorm light isn’t on, which means my roommate is either  gone or passed out for the rest of the night, come earthquake or  avalanche. There.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei turned the car  off, taking half a second even in her fervor to make sure she wasn’t  illegally parked. She wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, for the  first time in many years, Sei Satou allowed herself to be led.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was led up that  walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was led up several  flights of stairs. She was led into a small, well-kept dorm room  which was, indeed, empty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was led onto  Yumi’s soft bed. They both huddled slightly under the sheets; it  was cold. When Yumi saw the shape of Sei’s body; the smooth,  well-developed curves, she gave a sharp, flustered intake of breath:  Her own body was nowhere near so well-proportioned. Sei was, by most  standards, very beautiful.  Her breasts were full and her waist was  slim, her hips curved just so.  Yumi’s body was, in many ways,  still young, though it would never grow much more than it already  had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei thought her  gorgeous, and told her so, the honesty apparent in her voice.  It  made Yumi smile, and it made Yumi blush a little, and it made Yumi  kiss her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They didn’t notice  the cold after that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sei later thought that what  they did that night might have been cowardly.<em> Hell, </em>she would  think, <em>most of that whole night was cowardice, through and  through. </em>She would later tell Endo Kunikuda most of the story,  though she skipped over certain, less plot-centric details. (Much to  Endo’s disappointment). What Endo Kunikuda, ever a good man, had to  say about it was this:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Obviously, I don’t  know the whole situation. I don’t know this Shimako girl, and I  don’t know Yumi, either. I don’t know the relationship you two  guys have, nor what relationship Yumi has with her ‘Onee-sama,’  (I hope that is a term you guys use for something other than blood  siblings, too; I really do).  It doesn’t matter, though. What I do  know is that you were lonely that night, and a little scared of  something that wasn’t entirely me and wasn’t entirely the girls at your school.  It  seems to me like you were scared on some fundamental level of  something like being alone.  And it sounds to me like Yumi was  feeling more or less the same way. What you two did had nothing to do  with cowardice and everything to do with love and support. </em>There,  he stopped, and added with a wry grin, <em>Or some girly bullshit like  that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe he was  right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe it all was just  bullshit.  After all, Sei was the kind of girl who wore her hair down  and played her music as loud as she damn well pleased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Yumi…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yumi was the kind of  girl that Sei would love to have along for the ride, whatever that  ride might have been. Even if there wasn’t any sex at the end of  the tunnel; even if it was <em>just friends </em>for them. <em>(It’s  curtains, curtains for you). </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was enough.  Six  weeks later, she was asked out by a pretty girl from her school—one  who had always worn her hair down, even though she kept her head  down; Sei accepted. She told Yumi, and Yumi was delighted. That meant  that it <em>was </em>Just Friends for them.  It hurt, but there was  nothing cowardly about that.  Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was just fine.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A  little end note: I've recieved some criticism at this point that Sei is  uncharacteristically weak in this story. This is a perfectly valid  opinion; indeed, it seemed to me like this too, until I reached the  end, but I'd love it if you considered this before you set your mind  too intently:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cowardice happens to us all; we do strange things when we are  afraid. Those who do not are not truly human. I have deliberately not  described in great detail the events which led up to this story (for  example, what precisely Sei is afraid of, though I'm sure those of us  who have grown up different in a bigoted environment can guess) because  I wanted to leave this up to the reader's imagination. So, imagine, for  a moment, if you will: What would you be afraid of which might cause  you to act out in a way that would make people hesitate to believe that  it was even you? If you were in Sei's shoes, what would you fear? If  you like, I can generate a probable scenario for you--it is certainly  not beyond my realm of talent, however meagre it may be, to do so--but  I think it's fascinating if you, dear reader, consider it unto  yourself. Consider how Sei observed Yumi overcoming her own fear, and  think on how that may have affected Sei, who has always been affected  by Yumi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of course, all of this may simply be the author's  melodramatic attempt to bullshit his way out of a mediocre piece of  work--if that is how you see it, that's your business. I think about  these things after I've written them, and they seem to make sense to  me, but of course they do--I wrote them. However you think of this, I  thank you for reading.</span></p>
