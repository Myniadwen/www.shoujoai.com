<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When Sachiko angrily corrects, “<em>Miss</em> Fukuzawa,” you may liken that to “Fukuzawa-<em>sama</em>,” as though the butler had said, “Fukuzawa-san” or simply, “Fukuzawa.”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Rain, rain, go away / come again another day / all the world is waiting for the sun</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rain</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  had never really formed an opinion about the rain until the day of her  picnic with Yumi. Until that point, rain had meant an umbrella and a  change of socks at the day’s end. Maybe she would have to pay attention  to where exactly her skirt went. Maybe it would be muggy afterwards.  Maybe she’d need a jacket because it was cold.<br />
      <em>maybe yumi will run</em> <em>to</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Simple things. Rain was an inconvenience at worst, and relaxing to listen to at best.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Today,  though. Today rain was something evil, a Satan-spawned plague brought  on by too much pornography and cursing and not enough prayer by the  world at large; rain was something to be hated and feared. Rain was…<em>her in the rain again not me </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rain  was beginning to tickle the cement directly in front of Sachiko,  slowly, steadily changing its color to that strange color, impossible  to label, that was nothing more than a darker, more translucent version  of itself. It was raining.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At first, Sachiko’s mind didn’t  register the consequences of the current weather situation. It listed  through all of the little things automatically; she subconsciously  considered the need for an umbrella if she were to leave the house; how  many changes of socks she had left in her drawer; whether pants or a  skirt would be more acceptable for the day’s wear. Perhaps this  withdrawal into routine was her mind’s way of reeling in shock. Maybe  Sachiko was just a difficult person to really bother.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe not. A few moments later, it hit her, all at once, full in the face: <em>It’s raining.<br />
  </em><em>We can’t have a picnic in the rain.<br />
  </em><em>Our plans are ruined. I’ll have to<br />
  </em>cancel<br />
  <em>call Yumi<br />
  </em>again<br />
  <em>and then there will be all the hassle of rescheduling a date after  the ground has dried and she’ll probably just want to call the whole  thing off and</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sa-chan?” Suguru’s pleasant, cautious voice  didn’t so much startle her out of her halfway-panicked reverie as it  engaged her reflexive politeness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” She turned  automatically, tearing her eyes away from the off-colored pavement with  some difficulty. “What is it?” As she focused on Suguru, the past day’s  argument flooded freshly back into her mind, and she had to fight to  keep her voice level with him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As far as confrontation is  concerned, a lady should have no recollection of any day but the  present. The only thing a lady might carry that is worse than suspicion  is a grudge. Each morning, you should wake feeling refreshed, a freshly  bloomed flower. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Who had told her all of these things? They moved through her mind with a specific voice, but one that she could not place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Suguru said. “Only that you seemed lost deep in thought, and I was curious what it was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Suguru has never been curious a day in his life. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The only thing a lady could carry that is worse than…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  nothing.” Though she showed no outward sign, Sachiko was, in fact,  struggling to come up with an answer to his question that would satiate  his ‘curiosity’ to the point where for once in his life he’d just <em>f--<br />
  </em><em>a lady does not curse<br />
</em>go away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m simply trying to think of a place near the  river that would be suitable for a picnic in this weather.” Their  family had been planning for many years to install a gazebo in that  area, but Sachiko could not for the life of her remember if they had  ever gotten around to it or not. Which probably meant they hadn’t. Her  heart sunk a little further down towards her toes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, are you still doing that? With this weather?” Suguru said in his most <em>blasé </em>tone, something that Sachiko wasn’t used to from him. <em>From his parents, and his siblings, yes. But never him. He’s never been…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The only thing…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Sachiko felt it anyway, the suspicion. Suguru was up to something; had he been asked by somebody<br />
      <em>my parents<br />
    </em>to do something? To stop her, perhaps, from leaving the property?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  reason that suspicion comes so close to topping this list is this; I  will only tell you once, so listen closely: The only enemies a lady  should have should require no suspicion. You should simply assume that  whatever your enemies say and do is gifted with either an ulterior  motive or a frankly malicious intent. A lady who simply flings  suspicion around willy-nilly will be put in her place far more quickly  than you could </em>dream <em>by those who she considers to be above suspicion.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is Suguru my enemy?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The side of her which still reeled from</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>not thinking about that</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">events that had long since been and gone said <em>yes </em>as  immediately and firmly as they could, but the more rational side of her  told her differently. The more rational side of her told her that maybe  Suguru had retained his mood from yesterday, and that whatever had been  plaguing him them was still eating at him now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The more rational  side of her told her, in short, that Suguru was just being moody. She  could empathize with it, even if she would never condone acting on it.  But then, that school that he went to didn’t teach restraint nearly as  adeptly as did hers; his actions regarding Yumi’s little brother,  Yuuki, were enough to prove that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So, with a great effort and a  small intake of breathe, she let go of her nagging suspicion and dealt  with him as she always did: Shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi and I have held these  plans for several days,” she said shortly, her tone dropping a bit to  imply a subtle sort of lecture—the kind she used to reserve for <em>Rosa</em> <em>Gigantea</em> during her moments of indiscretion. “And because they are on <em>our </em>property,  it is my responsibility to ensure that they go smoothly, and since  these plans are not my plans alone, it would be incredibly rude of me  to simply decide that, because of a simple thing like the rain,  everybody, even those who I have not spoken with directly on the  matter, should simply interrupt their plans. That is my responsibility.  You should know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a moment after she said it, she even believed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No,  longer than a moment. As she articulated, carefully, her sentence  chastising Suguru, she felt her worry vanish and her confidence return;  she was not an upbeat person by nature, but she was also not one to  simply give up on something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suguru’s face did not display its  usual cool indifference, but rather a sort of satisfaction. “I see,” he  said calmly. “Forgive my rudeness, then. And…” he waited a moment,  testing the waters carefully, trying to avoid another lecture, “if I  may suggest it, there is a lovely gazebo near the edge of the river  that has gone rather underused since its completion several months ago.  Perhaps you should have your picnic there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko’s mind  cleared immediately at this, and though she didn’t give a smile, she  wanted to. Briefly, she even felt something other than her usual vague  sense of hostility towards Suguru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t show that, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” she said. “I’ll probably do that. Thank you for your suggestion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything for you, milady,” Suguru said with a grin, and then gave a small bow. “I’m glad I could help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  very sorry for the trouble,” Sachiko said by way of a dismissal, a hint  which Suguru, surprisingly, took. He gave her one final grin, and then  turned and left the kitchen quickly, as though retreating to his secret  hideout.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Perhaps that’s not a bad analogy, either. </em>Sachiko still had no idea where he went to for hours at a time. She had even once<br />
      <em>twice<br />
    </em>searched for him, unsuccessfully that firsttime.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That issue  laid to rest, the rain become something friendly again; Sachiko was  very glad of this change in perspective. The more she considered it,  the less she really wanted to make an enemy of something as powerful as  the elements; the true path to being a malcontent lay, she understood,  in finding very obscure things to focus one’s hatred on, rather than  doing as most of the world does and focusing it on one or two people,  typically an ex-lover or a public figure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or a family member.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  wasn’t entirely fair, though, so Sachiko drove it from her head at  roughly the same time that the door to the kitchen slid silently open  and the impassive figure entered without any particular addition to the  room’s noise levels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Miss Sachiko,” the butler said, his voice indicating a question but his words indicating an uninteresting observation. <em>Why, yes, that </em>is <em>a Sachiko sitting in our kitchen. But, Takashi, however did it get there? I could have sworn I set the traps last night. </em>“There is a phone call waiting for you on line two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did  you ask who it was from?” Sachiko asked, suddenly irate. The best  explanation she could come up with this sudden mood swing was that he  probably had asked. She couldn’t explain it any better than that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  believe she mentioned her family name…I believe it was…” he paused for  a moment, and had he been permitted by Sachiko’s family to chew on his  lip, he would have almost certainly been doing so. “Fukuzawa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There. That was it; the butler’s tone was what had pissed her off; or, not precisely his tone. His demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  the same demeanor he’s always held with my family—one of indifference.  That’s why mother likes him so much; she reminds him of father.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko had often wondered where she had left off calling her father &quot;daddy&quot;Maybe she never had. She couldn’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was not so attached to that image of her father. Maybe that was another  reason she didn’t consider Suguru her enemy—one thing that he had never  been was indifferent. He was infuriating, sometimes spiteful, and  often—in her mind—a complete bastard, but he was never indifferent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Miss </em>Fukuzawa,” she said, allowing her voice to carry that same <em>I sign your paychecks, so the next words out of your mouth had goddamn better be an apology </em>tone already possessed by so many millions of dissatisfied retail customers the world over, “is my <em>petite soeur, </em>and is thereby as,”<em> dear to me, </em>“much  of a member of this family as any of its blood relatives. Please treat  her, whether to her face or to mine, with the same respect and  courtesy,” <em>and indifference,</em> “that you would afford to any of your employers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  butler, whose name Sachiko could not remember for the life of her,  bowed humbly and falsely, apologizing as profusely and disingenuously  as was appropriate. He exited a moment later, and a moment after that,  the <em>line </em>button on the kitchen phone began blinking. Sachiko  crossed the kitchen as quickly as her skirt’s hem would allow, but then  paused a moment before she reached the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m not wearing a skirt.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was wearing her nightgown. It had only been half an hour since she had  gotten out of bed, though it had been distinctly longer since she’d  woken.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She paused a moment to ponder what this meant, but  couldn’t come up with anything particularly satisfactory, so she picked  the phone up and spoke into it, though she knew precisely who was on  the line and who they were waiting for, “Sachiko Ogasawara speaking.”  She sometimes wondered why she even bothered saying her family  name—whoever called her house had heard it at least twice before they  ever spoke to the person they were trying to get to; at least once  before they spoke to a real human being.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A lady announces her presence in precisely the same manner no matter where she is. A lady does not </em>slack off<em> simply because she is at home. You should not answer a phone with, </em>yeah, who is it? <em>any more than you should answer your husband calling you in that way.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko-<em>onee-sama?</em>”  Yumi was practically stuttering, and Sachiko had to keep herself from  giggling. Yumi had been caught between her mistakes and her training,  and had spoken like a child calling out in awe to her older sister. It  was really very<br />
      <em>sweet<br />
    </em>poorly trained, but Sachiko thought she could allow her <em>petite seour </em>this one slip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because she brings you such joy. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think <em>onee-sama </em>will suffice, don’t you?” Sachiko said pleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Are you…teasing her?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko supposed she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes,” Yumi said, composing herself as quickly as she could. “Of course. I’m very sorry, <em>onee-sama.</em>”  It was the third time she’d slipped in three days; Sachiko imagined she  must be getting a bit disheartened, and wanted desperately, in some  backwards part of her heart, to comfort her. She didn’t, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, what had you called to talk about, Yumi?” She realized fully  well that this was, nearly word-for-word, the exact same thing that she  had said to Yumi the last time she’d called, but didn’t think much of  it; it was the same thing she said to a lot of people. It was just part  of her<br />
      <em>training<br />
    </em>personality.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a brief silence from Yumi’s end of the  line, and then, slowly and carefully, “I was…ah…wondering if you still  wanted to have the picnic, since it’s raining outside.” She stopped  again, and Sachiko was unsure as to whether she was waiting for an  answer or simply considering what to say next; this was a problem that  Sachiko didn’t have with many people—she was fully capable of reading  most people like books. Bold-faced books, at that. Not Yumi, though; so  while Sachiko paused to consider this, Yumi seemed to grow disheartened  again, or nervous, or both. “If not, I’d be happy to reschedule it for  another day—I can call Yoshino, and Rei lives right next door to her,  and…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko waited for this pause to last a second or two—<em>even  if your husband is spouting sheer nonsense at you, you will wait for  him to finish before speaking your fair part. Interruption is  inexcusable—</em>and then said, “I don’t think that we have to call off  the picnic just yet, Yumi; we have a small gazebo near the river that  would be perfect to take shelter in. If that’s alright with you, that  is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of—of course!” Yumi’s relief was fairly well palpable, even over the phone. “I’d love t—er…I’d be glad to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something small and cruel inside of Sachiko whispered to her, <em>that girl is of ill breeding; she is too easily excitable, and even many more years of training can do nothing to cure that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But that’s not true, </em>Sachiko knew. <em>In front of others, in front of </em>men,<em> Yumi is exemplary. It’s only when she’s...</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Being herself? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful,” Sachiko said. “Will you be making your own way over, or shall I have someone come to pick you up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I—”  there was a noise from Yumi’s end of the phone—a sharp blaring sound,  like a car’s horn. Twice more, and Yumi said, “Excuse me for a moment, <em>onee-sama</em>. I should—” Again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Sachiko said, as curious as Yumi probably was, though it was  harder to gauge now that Yumi had a hold of herself again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment later, Yumi’s voice reappeared, confused. “<em>Onee-sama, </em>did you invite <em>Rosa Gigantea </em>to  this picnic?” In an involuntary moment of panic, Sachiko's mind jumped  someplace she didn't really want it going, so she paused and forced  herself to think rationally. <em>Yumi knows a different </em>Rosa Gigantea <em>than I do. It couldn't be </em>her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought that you had invited Shimako,” Sachiko frowned. <em>But Shimako would never sit outside and blare a horn at somebody.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not…not<em> that Rosa Gigantea.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took Sachiko less than a second to catch onto what Yumi was saying, to  realize that her instinct had been, as it usually was, dead on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Satou Sei?” she said, a little horrified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Yumi sounded too stunned to say anything more articulate. Sachiko couldn’t blame her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is she...,” <em>Shimako wouldn’t have told her. She probably doesn’t even speak to her anymore. So who could have…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  Yumi’s end of the phone: “Yumi? There’s somebody here to see you.” And  a moment later, from a familiar voice, “Yumi! It’s been a while!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sei!  What are you—” Yumi’s voice was muffled, and Sachiko had to fight off  the urge to make a fool of herself by telling Sei off over the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m here to pick you up, of course. Sachiko’s having a picnic, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  crunching sound filled the line, the sound of the receiver being tossed  around slightly, probably in an effort to stabilize it against one’s  ear, and then, “<em>Onee-sama, </em>Sei is—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You may, if you  please, tell her not to be so forward with you,” Sachiko snapped a  little more harshly than she’d intended to. In the next instant, worry  filled her that she’d somehow hurt Yumi’s feelings by snapping at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before she could apologize—<em>that’s not saying much. A lot of things will happen before</em> you <em>apologize to somebody, </em>said that little bitter thing in her head—Sei said, “Don’t worry, Sachiko! I’ll have her to your house pretty quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m really sorry, <em>onee-sama!</em>” Yumi called. “I tried to stop—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, Yumi,” Sei said. “We don’t want to be late!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The line went dead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  stood there for a moment afterwards, the phone still pressed against  her ear, torn between irritation and something very much resembling  jealousy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Don’t worry about it, </em>she told herself forcefully. <em>Sei is…eccentric. She won’t have any adverse affect on Yumi. On the training that you’ve been giving her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  didn’t believe for a moment that this was what was bothering her about  Sei’s visit. It would have been like telling the Prime Minister that  the reason the economy was in a slump was because skyscrapers were  being built too tall and fancy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shaking her head, Sachiko forced  herself to forget about it. She had work to do now—she had to prepare  umbrellas and food, though the food had mostly been prepared by the  cooking staff last night, and she had to change into clothes that were  suitable for public viewing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But nobody could ever forget about something that easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not really.</span></p>
