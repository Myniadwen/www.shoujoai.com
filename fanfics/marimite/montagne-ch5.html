fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pcorrigan.html">Paul Corrigan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/montagne-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>I didn&#146;t immediately ask what errand Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had to run, or where 
exactly we were going. She rose and walked down the steps and onto the 
gravel path, over the ditch and across the grass to the bridge over the 
freeway, and I followed quickly behind.

--What is this ditch? I asked her.

--Oh, that?...That&#146;s the wall of the old city. The field used to be 
outside it. Soldiers would do their drills here. This is the Champ de 
Mars, the field of Mars.

I looked ahead of us. Sei had said Chinatown was not far away. Just 
ahead of us, just over the bridge over the freeway, I could see a 
building with

Chinese features. The H&ocirc;pital chinois de Montr&eacute;al. With the old wall 
gone, it

seemed as if the freeway walled off the new city from encroaching on the 
old.

Separating Sei Sato&#146;s world from Shiori Kubo&#146;s.

We walked into the station and passed by the ticket booth. The attendant 
was still reading his newspaper, and barely looked up at us as we 
passed. It wasn&#146;t until we had walked down the steps to the platform 
that I thought to ask:

--What&#146;s in your bag?

--Oh this?...it&#146;s cloth for making clothes.

--You make your own clothes?

--All of them.

--I&#146;m impressed, I said. I wouldn&#146;t know where to begin! Your work is

beautiful!

--You flatter me. It&#146;s not particularly expensive cloth. And I haven&#146;t 
been

making clothes that long. I never made my own clothes in Japan. I taught

myself how here.

I meant it too. It was simple, but Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked radiant in it, and if 
it

was the work of a beginner, it didn&#146;t show. The skirt seemed almost 
seamless,

like Jesus&#146; robe.

There were plenty of others on the platform&#151;a sign the next train would 
not

be long--but even so we sat down to wait.

--But then is clothing that expensive in Canada?

--Oh no. And if it were I could go to the St-Vincent-de-Paul. I used to 
do

that.

--But then why...?

--Why? Ste. Marguerite didn&#146;t have a St-Vincent to go to in the middle 
of the

Canadian forest, did she? It wasn&#146;t like France, where the convents 
could

live on alms and the nuns could do nothing all day but pray. They would 
have

starved! No. Ste. Marguerite and her sisters had to be completely self-

sufficient. They couldn&#146;t even have traded with the Indians for 
cloth&#151;the

Indians didn&#146;t use it. So they made their own cloth and their own 
clothes.

Even today the sisters are supposed to have full-time jobs.

--And still make their own clothes?

--Well, no. I do that because I want to. Because, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se added, smiling 
a

little apologetically, if I told you I was completely self-sufficient, 
I&#146;d be

lying. Even the sewing machine was given me.

--By whom?

--My cousin. Or I call him cousin, but he&#146;s actually my fathers. I&#146;m 
living

with him at the moment. He owns a Japanese restaurant near Concordia. I 
work

there part time. I won&#146;t live with the sisters for a while yet. To tell 
the

truth, he was rather surprised when I asked for one.

--So why do you do it? To imitate Ste. Marguerite&#146;s example?

As the train entered the station Th&eacute;r&egrave;se replied:

--It&#146;s a way to meditate on her. Yes, if you like. To imitate her as 
best I

can.

--

--Prochaine station, Place-d&#146;Armes.

The metro car was crowded, and we were very lucky that a couple in two

adjacent seats decided to get off at Champ-de-Mars. We grabbed them as

quickly as we could, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se placing her bag by her feet in the aisle.

--Are we going to see your uncle? I asked Th&eacute;r&egrave;se at last.

--No, no. Not yet. I have class this afternoon at Marianopolis.

--Then where...

--Villa-Maria station. It&#146;s named after my high school actually. It&#146;s 
right

there by the entrance. I have a friend--an old classmate actually. She 
works

in a shop nearby. There&#146;s something I have to return to her.

--Villa-Maria...that means &#147;City of Mary&#148; too, right? I asked.

--Yes, it does. It&#146;s a common name in the city. There&#146;s even a 
skyscraper

named for her. Place Ville-Marie. Didn&#146;t I tell you? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se added with 
a

smile. Our Lady watches us everywhere here.

--What about St. John the Baptist?

--Yes, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se said at last. He watches us here too.

--Station Place-d&#146;Armes.

An old Chinese man got up at the station and walked past us to get out 
at the stop, kicking Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s bag by accident as he did so. It was 
enough to knock it over and send a couple of books falling out of the 
bag and towards me. I picked them up. Japanese comic books, of all 
things, by a woman called Yamaji Ebine, translated into French. Artwork 
of tomboyish-looking women on the covers. The name meant nothing to me, 
but the label did: Asuka Yuri.

--Are these yours? I asked, as I tried to hand them to her as if I 
hadn&#146;t

noticed anything out of the ordinary.

--No, they&#146;re not.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was smiling as I looked up at her.

--Disappointed?

The train pulled out of the station as I tried to figure out how to 
answer.

--Prochaine station, Square-Victoria.

--Surprised, I said at last.

--Actually, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se went on, they belong to a friend of mine.

--A Japanese friend?

--Oh no! A Canadian. You&#146;d be surprised. Japanese comics are very 
popular

here. She insisted I borrow them. I was going to return them.

--May I see?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked a bit surprised herself, but answered:

--If you like.

One of the volumes was called Free Soul. I opened a page at random. Two 
women

were standing in a city street, talking.

Niki: On a jou&eacute; ensemble en live, l&agrave;-bas. Nos trompettes se sont 
crois&eacute;es je

ne sais combien de fois. J&#146;ai vecu &ccedil;a comme une exp&eacute;rience &eacute;blouissante 
de

bonheur, extatique. Et puis il m&#146;a tenue plusieurs nuits dans ses bras. 
En

clair, &ccedil;a voulait dire &#147;Voil&agrave;, on s&#146;arr&ecirc;te ici.&#148; Me voici compl&egrave;tement

lib&eacute;r&eacute;e de lui. J&#146;ai fini de le poursuivre. L&#146;envie m&#146;a prise de te

l&#146;annoncer. Souviens-toi de tes paroles: &#147;Un p&egrave;re n&#146;est pas un 
amoureux.&#148; Et

alors je suis venue te dire, &#147;tu as raison.&#148;

Keito: Niki...

Niki: Il n&#146;est pas trop tard?

Keito: Hein?

Niki: Je veux dire: ton coeur bat toujours pour moi? Si c&#146;est oui, je 
suis &agrave;

toi. Je t&#146;aime, tu sais, Keito.

--Station Square-Victoria.

--You see, Niki seduced Keito. For Niki it was just a fling, but she 
broke

Keito&#146;s heart. Keito thought Niki loved her, but Niki&#146;s heart belonged 
to

nobody but her father, a musician who traveled the world. Niki was a 
musician

like him. But she had only rarely seen him. Perhaps that made him easier 
to

love.

I looked up at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--You read it?

--Certainly I read it, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Prochaine station, Bonaventure.

--But you&#146;re right, she added. I&#146;m as surprised as you are.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se settled back in her seat, and went on:

--When I lived in Japan, I as convinced that comics were the lowest, 
trashiest, STUPIDEST books you could possibly read.

She turned to me, smiling sheepishly, and went on:

--But now that I&#146;m here I can&#146;t put the blasted things down!

--Why&#146;s that? Do they remind you of home, then? I asked.

--Yes, she replied. That&#146;s one reason.

Th&eacute;rese looked away again. I still had the books in my hand. During all 
this she had not actually made any effort to take them back. I found 
myself gripping them tightly. There was so much I wanted to ask, and 
perhaps she wanted me to ask, and perhaps Sei had hoped I would ask. But 
if I hadn&#146;t dared ask Sei, whom I knew as well as anyone, about Shiori 
Kubo, I could hardly ask Shiori Kubo herself, a woman I had never met 
before today.

--Sei...at Lillian she knew a Shiori Kubo, I tried at last. Do you 
remember her?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked back at me, a little too quickly.

--What did Sei tell you about her?

--Nothing, I admitted. Nothing at all.

--Then how...?

--From other people.

--Other people say all sorts of things. You didn&#146;t ask Sei yourself?

--I didn&#146;t want to. I knew about her. Everyone did. I didn&#146;t need to 
know more. To ask would only have hurt her.

--What did the others say about Shiori Kubo?

--Station Bonaventure.

I hesitated a moment. How to phrase this?

--They said...Sei and Shiori loved each other. That Shiori had to leave 
Lillian because of Sei. That...it broke Sei&#146;s heart.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se thought about that a moment before replying:

--Yes. Yes, I remember her.

--Prochaine station, Lucien-L&#146;Allier.

We fell silent. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked away from me again, her smile gone, 
replaced with shame. She had not, of course, said, &#147;I&#146;m Shiori Kubo,&#148; 
even though she obviously realized now I knew who she was. She had said 
&#147;I remember her,&#148; the way one speaks of someone long dead.

--Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, I asked, is what they said about Shiori true?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se did not answer. Rather her face turned reflective, and she said:

--I&#146;ve thought a great deal about St. John the Baptist while I&#146;ve been 
here.

I think it&#146;s fitting he be the patron of this place. Don&#146;t you?

--What? I hadn&#146;t thought about it that much, I admitted, not 
understanding.

--You know why he went out into the wilderness, don&#146;t you?

--Yes, of course, I said. He went into the wilderness, living on nothing 
but locusts and honey, to baptize and preach the coming of the Messiah.

--Do you think so?

--That&#146;s what&#146;s written in the Gospel, isn&#146;t it?

--It is...but I asked you why he went into the wilderness. He could have 
baptized and preached the coming of the Messiah in the town. Why didn&#146;t 
he do that, do you suppose?

I thought a moment, the metro stopping as I did.

--Station Lucien-L&#146;Allier.

--Isaiah and other prophets did the same, mortifying themselves in the 
desert.

Didn&#146;t they? I offered at last.

--Yes, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. But what occurred to them to do such a thing?

--I&#146;m not sure, I said as the car pulled out again.

--Why? I asked? What do you think that it was?

--Prochaine station, Georges-Vanier.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se shut her eyes, and was silent a moment. At last she said, or 
rather recited:

--In the days when the Israelites wandered in the desert the Lord gave a 
commandment to Moses. To purge their people of sin, the Israelites were 
to take two goats. One goat was for the Lord. The other was for the 
demon Azazel. The priests would take the goat for the Lord and sacrifice 
it. The other goat the priests were to drive away into the desert, 
taking the sins of Israel with it into some uninhabited land.

--So...the goat for the Lord was Jesus, and John the goat for Azazel?

--It was Our Lord who preached in the town and in the temple, and it was 
he would be the perfect sacrifice. Many thought John was the Saviour, 
but he was not. He knew that quite well. For the Saviour had to be free 
of sin. As it was when He finally came John begged Jesus to baptize him, 
to cleanse him of his sin.

--What sin?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se opened her eyes, seeming to be genuinely surprised.

--You&#146;re sure you don&#146;t know?

--No, I don&#146;t, I said, because I didn&#146;t. I remembered nothing of any sin 
St.

John might have committed from the Bible or from catechism.

--The wife of Herod hated John the Baptist, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and taught her 
daughter Salome to do so. You remember how Herod had Salome dance before 
him and his courtiers, offering her whatever her heart desired if she 
did?

--I do, I said. She asked for the head of John the Baptist on a dish.

--Prochaine station, Georges-Vanier.

--I always wondered how a woman could hate a man so much, whom she had 
never met, that she would have her own daughter dance sinfully before 
her own father, just to do someone harm. How a daughter could willingly 
do such a thing. Until one day I realized how it could be.

--What?

--The man Salome called father was not her father, and the man her 
mother called husband was not her husband. Not in the eyes of God, 
anyway.

--You mean...

--Yes. I don&#146;t know how--but John had sinned with the wife of Herod. 
When he realized what he had done he fled. That is why Herod&#146;s wife 
hated John the

Baptist, and taught Salome to hate her father. He had disgraced her.

--But couldn&#146;t she have said that to...to Herod? That she had been 
disgraced?

--Well, yes, but how? To condemn him would have been to condemn herself. 
She would have been stoned as an adulteress, and she knew it. So she 
waited until the right moment came.

--But...Saint John tried to carry away not just Israel&#146;s sin, but his 
own?

--Yes, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. That&#146;s exactly what I mean.

--Station Georges-Vanier.

--I...I never thought of it that way, I said at last.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se suddenly laughed, and said:

--You&#146;re not the first person to say that to me! I&#146;m sorry. I mustn&#146;t be 
making much sense!

--Prochaine station, Lionel-Groulx.

--No, it&#146;s all right, I said, smiling as best I could to reassure her. I

suppose I thought you might have been a poet.

--What? You mean you think me a poet? You flatter me.

--Well...perhaps you should write down what you told me just now.

--I wonder, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. Composition was my worst subject. I asked 
Mother Superior how to become a better writer once. She said, &#147;If you 
want to become

a good writer, said Aristotle, become a good person. Then write 
naturally.

That&#146;s why the word of the Lord is like poetry. Because God is good.&#148;

I remembered; Mother Superior had said the same thing to us many times 
in class.

--You don&#146;t think you&#146;re good enough to write well? I said.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked away again, towards the door of the metro car.

--Nobody is good but God alone, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Station Lionel-Groulx.

We fell silent again. When the doors opened a larger number of people 
got in and out than normal; we must have been at a hub. I couldn&#146;t help 
noticing a young woman with Middle Eastern features get on, clearly 
pregnant, pushing a stroller onto the car, and sitting in the single 
seat close to the door.

--Or perhaps his mother Mary.

--Prochaine station, Place-Saint-Henri.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se must have noticed me looking. It was only then that I noticed 
the woman&#146;s head-covering was bright blue, like Our Lady&#146;s would have 
been. I looked back to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, a bit too quickly, realizing I&#146;d been 
staring. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was looking over at the woman herself, seemingly more 
at peace, as if she was in fact contemplating Our Lady in the metro car.

--Our Lady might have looked like her. She would have worn a 
head-covering

like that. That&#146;s why nuns wore veils, in imitation of Our Lady. And to 
think

people get angry to see a woman dressed like that...!

--She reminds you of Our Lady? I asked.

--Oh...! Forgive me. A poet, you called me? A madwoman, more likely!

--No, no...I see what you mean, I said. But would it really have been 
blue?

--No. No, you&#146;re right. That&#146;s poetry. And you&#146;re right, it&#146;s not Mary.

--What do you mean?

--Rather one of her daughters, whom Mary watches over.

I wouldn&#146;t have called Th&eacute;r&egrave;se a madwoman either. I would have called 
her otherworldly to a fault, her world reflected through her faith--no, 
seeing in this world another world, the one she had seen in the poetry 
of Scripture, able to see Our Lady effortlessly in a fellow passenger on 
the metro car, or to greet the Baptist whenever she saw him, when any 
other would have see public art and passed on, if they&#146;d noticed it at 
all. The precise opposite of Sei Sato. I could easily see Sei calling 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se mad.

Or was she? I knew Sei had always liked to read. The world of the 
imagination appealed to her. Perhaps it had been Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Kubo&#146;s 
otherworldliness that captured Sei&#146;s heart, bypassing her affected 
cynicism by way of her imagination.

--Station Place-Saint-Henri.

--A daughter of the queen of heaven, and its king, her son. You heard in 
the museum about the filles du roi, didn&#146;t you? said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, as if it 
had reminded her of that very question.

--Yes...women brought to be wives for the settlers in Canada, I said. 
Ste.

Marguerite trained them how to keep house...right?

--Prochaine station, Vend&ocirc;me.

--There was more to it than that. They were women and girls from 
orphanages, institutions, the streets. They would have had no idea how 
to keep house.

They never had anything like a normal life. Ste. Marguerite would have 
had to teach them everything. Who would have had a woman like that? No 
sane man in

France. So the daughters of the king were rounded up and transported to 
Canada to be wives for the settlers, so France would be rid of them. 
France driving its sins into the wilderness...

--Why? Had they led sinful lives?

--Some had. But not all. Not even most. And even those who had...as many 
had been betrayed by those wanting to sin than sinned of their own 
accord.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se sighed, looking sad, and went on.

--Not everyone can tell the difference.

--But then, I offered, Canada must have been their chance for 
redemption, either way. To start again...

--Yes. That&#146;s it exactly.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se seemed to cheer at that thought. She looked back at me, going 
on:

--They lived, at last, much better lives than they could have in France. 
To have a husband, children, a normal life. And they weren&#146;t the last to 
come here for that. Or to be driven out of their own lands, to come here 
as a refuge. Many of my friends as school have parents who did just 
that. Perhaps even our friend over there, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se added, ever so 
slightly indicating the woman in the blue headdress. Mary fleeing with 
the child Jesus into Egypt, Jesus serving as scapegoat for Herod&#146;s sins.

--Station Vend&ocirc;me.

--Is that why you want to be a teacher? I asked. To train young girls in 
the

way they should go? How to survive here?

--Oh?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se seemed surprised at the question, but in the end nodded her 
head.

--Yes. That&#146;s it.

--But...added Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--But what?

--That&#146;s a long way off. First I have to learn it myself. What could I 
teach them right now? The Canadian girls have taught me more than I&#146;ve 
taught them, so far. I haven&#146;t had one-fiftieth the difficulties Ste. 
Marguerite had, and

I haven&#146;t found it easy.

--Prochaine station, Villa-Maria.

--Why not?

--Well, when I got here I had to learn French in record time. Because I 
wasn&#146;t allowed go to an English school, even though I spoke English much 
better than French. I managed it, but I still speak English better than 
French. And...

--And?...

--When I told my classmates I wanted to be a nun, they thought I was 
mad. And this was at a Catholic school!

--Did they reject you?

--Not all...but many.

Clearly I had brought back a bad memory. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se sighed again.

--It&#146;s true. I was lonely here for a long time.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se suddenly smiled, as if to reassure me, and added:

--But I survived, as you can see. Has Sei told you about the winters 
here?

--A little.

--Well...in Nagasaki it&#146;s always warm. I even found Tokyo rather cold, 
when I lived there. I arrived in Montreal just after Christmas. When I 
stepped outside the terminal and felt the wind chill and saw the snow on 
the ground...I thought I had landed in hell. And I had a warm bed 
waiting for me.

How much harder it must have been for the king&#146;s daughters, during their 
first Canadian winter, living in cabins! But they survived too. You&#146;re 
right.

Compared to France what seemed like hell must have seemed in the end 
like heaven.

--Station, Villa-Maria.

--A goat&#146;s a hardy animal, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. It can live a long time in the 
desert.

VILLA-MARIA

As we pulled into the station the first thing I noticed were the 
multi-coloured, I should say candy-striped seats made out of some 
plastic of other, long stripes of red, orange and yellow going up to the 
ceiling.

The Muslim woman with the baby stroller got out just ahead of us. I 
walked with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in silence just behind her until we got to the 
stairs. The woman stopped at the stairs, as if not sure for a moment how 
to negotiate them with the stroller.

--Madame? Voulez-vous que je porte la poussette?

The woman looked back at us, noticing us for the first time. She smiled 
in gratitude.

--Ah! Vraiment? Merci!

The Canadian accent was not as strong as Madeleine&#39;s, but it was still 
unmistakable.

The woman took her child out of the stroller, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se folded it up and 
we walked up the stairs, across the walkway over the tracks and towards 
the escalator. Before us I saw coloured circles-purple, red, orange, 
yellow--in the wall with notches in them, that seemed to be turning 
counter-clockwise, like a key in a lock.

We eventually made it to the top of the escalator to street level, the 
entrance plain metal and glass, much of the glass marked with graffiti I 
couldn&#39;t decipher. Over the door to the street, straight ahead, was a 
sign reading BOULEVARD DECARIE. To the right was another door, leading 
to a bus stop.

While Th&eacute;r&egrave;se helped the woman with her stroller I looked around. A 
middle-aged Asian woman sat on a bench by the front door, a surly 
expression on her face, having a heated argument down her cell phone in 
a language I didn&#39;t understand. Two young black men were standing over 
to the right, joking around in French. They probably didn&#39;t even notice 
me, much less wish me harm--but still I found myself a bit apprehensive. 
I couldn&#39;t help thinking they could easily snap me in half.

--Say a prayer.

--What? I said, looking around.

--If you&#39;re apprehensive, say a prayer, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who was right by 
my side. That&#39;s what I used to do, when I came here first. I was 
overwhelmed. I&#39;d never seen people like that except in pictures.

She smiled and added:

--But really, there&#39;s nothing to fear here.

The Muslim woman walked over to the schedules on the wall right by the 
door.

Another woman in a black veil, a stout African woman, entered just then. 
She

smiled as she saw the woman with the stroller.

--Fatima! said the African woman, in perfect French. &Ccedil;a va bien?

--Oui! replied Fatima, smiling back. Toi?...Ah! Merci! she added, as she 
saw

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and I head for the door.

--De rien...bonjour, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to Fatima as she pushed the door open.

I followed her through. Before us on the street had been posted a city

map, announcing where we were:

ARRONDISEMENT COTE-DES-NEIGES

NOTRE-DAME-DE-GRACE

--Our Lady of Mercy, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. That&#39;s the name of this place.

We turned left and started walking up the street; literally next door to 
the metro station was an iron gate, with a sign announcing what lay 
behind it:

VILLA-MARIA

COLLEGE PRIVE

PRIVATE SCHOOL

I looked through the gate and thought for a moment that someone had 
played a trick on me and that I was somehow back in Japan, because it 
could have been

Lillian Academy; a long path led up to the school, lined with trees--not 
ginkgos, of course, though perhaps it was too cold for them here--many 
still bearing their autumn leaves, just as many on the ground, an array 
of colour that even the drizzle could not prevent from being beautiful.

What was at the end of the path? I wondered. I looked up, but all I saw 
was a building, presumably the school. Where was Our Lady?

--Our Lady is off to the side, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, as if she&#39;d read my mind. I 
used to pray to her every morning. It is a lot like Lillian, isn&#39;t it.

--So everyone had to pray to her as they passed?

--No. I was the only one who did.

--Really?

--I said it was a lot like Lillian. A few things were different, though.

--Did you like it there? It&#39;s beautiful, isn&#39;t it.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had had her teasing smile before, as if she had been making one 
of her jokes, but it faded just then as she added:

--Lillian was beautiful too.

She shook herself and went on:

--Come on. We&#39;re going a bit farther up the street.

So I followed her a bit farther up the street, crossing to the other 
side.

The neighbourhood around Villa-Maria reminded me of that around Lillian, 
too, much less fashionable a place than one would expect a place like it 
to stand.

The side of the house on the end of the row on the right had plenty of 
graffiti as well. On our side of the street was a building that still 
showed the faded lettering announcing what it had been long ago, the 
Institut des Beaux-Arts Villa-Maria.

The unfashionability of it must be what made it hospitable for 
newcomers.

Certainly they had made it their own. On the ground floor were two 
restaurants, one a Quartier Perse, the other a Lesvos Ouest. I must have 
looked at it too long, because Th&eacute;r&egrave;se noticed me looking and glossed, a 
bit too quickly:

--A Greek restaurant.

--That&#39;s what I thought it was.

--Well...not all of Montreal is the Village.

That did strike me as an odd remark.

--Well, of course, I said, not sure how else to respond.

The buildings on the other side of the street had more modestly 
appointed stores. A laundrette, a print shop, a hairdresser. A 
convenience store,

D&eacute;panneur Reine Camel. Above the stores were apartments. Probably the 
owners of the stores lived above them. The humidity from the drizzle 
made it feel a bit warmer than it was, and a middle-aged woman in a 
t-shirt was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigarette and staring off 
into the horizon.

I couldn&#39;t help noticing a sign announcing in English and French:

BAR A SUSHI BAR YAKIMONO

--Tell me, have you eaten there?

--Yes, with my friend, once. Can you believe they have kosher sushi?

--Kosher sushi?...

--Many people in Notre-Dame-de-Grace are Jewish. They consider it a sin 
to eat shellfish. So all the sushi there is salmon, tuna, eel--all bony 
fish that Jewish people can eat. So there are always many Jewish people 
there. It&#39;s the only sushi restaurant like it I&#146;ve ever seen.

--Jewish sushi? That&#39;s marvellous!

--This is Montreal!

--Your friend, I asked then. She lives on this street?

--No. She doesn&#39;t live far away...but she just works here. Don&#39;t worry,

we&#39;re almost there.

--Is she Jewish?

--No. A Catholic. Her mother is from Poland.

--Perhaps she works there then?

I pointed just up the street to where I could see a storefront 
announcing

CHARCUTERIE CHOPIN

PATISSERIE EUROPEEN

DELICATESSEN

Chopin was Polish...it was a romantic idea, but I thought surely that 
was where Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#39;s friend worked? The daughter of hard-working 
immigrants, tending the family store to help keep the family fed?

--Not quite, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, her teasing look returned. Next door.

I looked next door.

SCIFI ANIME

In the windows were advertised

ANIME DVD

MANGA

LOCATION &amp; VENTE

--An animation store? I said.

--What? Disappointed? teased Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Just surprised...but I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be. She did give you the

books, didn&#39;t she? I&#39;ll wait for you here.

--In the rain? You don&#39;t want to meet her? Or are you afraid of manga?

--No, but...is it all right?

--Of course. She&#39;s very nice. She&#39;ll like you, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, slipping 
between two cars parked on the street and starting to cross. Coming?

I quickly followed her across, checking a bit nervously for traffic.

--

te to te o tsunai dara

mukau toko muteki desho

--Hello? said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in English as we entered. Heloise, are you there?

--Hey! Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! was the response. A cheerful greeting, from a woman I 
didn&#146;t see immediately. She pronounced it &#147;Teriisu.&#148;

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se entered, and I followed her in. The first thing I noticed were 
display cases by the door, full of models of giant robots. Just behind 
the desk were boxes of paints and cement, imported from Japan.

A tomboyish young woman about our age and my height--whom I presumed was

Heloise--was behind the counter, looking towards us--or Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, at any 
rate-

-and waving as we came in. As I came closer I saw her T&#150;shirt bore a 
picture of a cute cartoon girl with green hair, holding a leek.

Heloise was rail-thin, and I&#146;d be lying if I called her stunningly 
beautiful; even from the door I noticed skin blemishes. I had to wonder 
too why she seemed to have dyed her page-boy bob an interesting shade of 
orange. Perhaps to look more like an animation character.

Her obvious friendliness made up for it, though; her smile was amazingly 
childlike, and couldn&#146;t help but cheer me too. I couldn&#146;t help thinking 
of

Sei. If I had only seen Sei in a photo, I wouldn&#146;t have called her 
beautiful either. Her looks were honestly a bit mannish, even before she 
had cut her hair. But I knew the photo would have lied.

I hung back a bit as Th&eacute;r&egrave;se went to the desk, to return Heloise&#146;s 
books.

--How are you? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se asked Heloise politely.

--Great! You?

--Fine...here are your books.

--Dude, you could have kept them &#145;til you were done. Didn&#146;t you like 
them?

--I finished them. I read them from cover to cover.

--Really? Wow...you like?

--They were interesting. I&#146;m glad I read them. Thank you...

--Yay! I made Th&eacute;r&egrave;se read yuri! Woohoo!

While Heloise celebrated her &#147;victory,&#148; I wandered around the store. One 
wall

was covered entirely with rental DVDs of animation. I even recognized a 
few: Gundam, Evangelion, Bleach, Inuyasha. Far more I had never heard 
of: Gekiganger III, Schoolgirl Milky Crisis, Testcard Warriors. On the 
back wall and on the right were more models; in the centre of the room 
were shelves of manga that had been translated into English. Nothing in 
French.

I found myself looking up and down for Rose of Versailles, but didn&#146;t 
see it. I turned back to Heloise and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who were talking about 
everything and nothing--or rather it was Heloise who talked excitedly 
and breathlessly about everything and nothing, while Th&eacute;r&egrave;se smiled 
back, adding a comment when she could.

--Excusez-moi...s&#146;il vous plait...ano...est-ce que...

--Oh, said Heloise, seeming to notice me for the first time. Can I help 
you?

--Do you have Rose of Versailles?

--Rose of Versailles?...No. I don&#146;t think you can get it in English.

--I...don&#146;t see...is there manga? In French?

--No, we don&#146;t sell it here. It&#146;s all English...say, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, said 
Heloise to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, aren&#146;t you going to introduce me to your friend?

--Oh! I&#146;m sorry!...Come here, Shimako. Heloise, this is Shimako Todo.

I approached, and bowed politely.

--Enchant&eacute;, I said.

Heloise smiled, still friendly though not quite as energetically, and 
offered her hand to be shaken.

--I&#146;m Erika.

But hadn&#146;t Th&eacute;r&egrave;se called her Heloise?...No matter. I gingerly took her 
hand.

--It&#146;s okay, I don&#146;t bite, said Erika. Much. And you can speak to me in

English too. Honest.

--It&#146;s okay? I said.

--Well, that&#146;s the language I think in, so...yeah. How do you know

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se?

--We went to the same school, in Japan...I started.

--We have a mutual friend who goes to McGill, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, much more 
fluently than I could have. We met by chance in the Old City.

--Whoa. Small world...said Erika. Shimako, right? How do you write that?

She found a pen and a scrap of paper and passed them to me. I wrote down 
my name in Chinese characters and explained what they meant.

--So, said Erika when I&#146;d finished, what are you doing in Montreal?

--Japanese...universities...are not very good. I want to go to 
university in Canada.

--So, McGill, maybe?

--Maybe...I was staying with my friend...

--Cool. You like Montreal?

--Yes. Very much.

--Cool, said Erika, less enthusiastically. Her smile faded for a moment.

Come on, though--it&#146;s no Tokyo.

--You have been to Tokyo? I asked.

--No. I want to visit though. Oh, I wanna go to Japan! added Erika, 
bouncing up and down a bit, like a child impatient for some sort of 
treat.

--Yes...please visit, I said, not sure how to respond. It&#146;s nice...

--Oh I know, Erika replied. My brother went when he was at McGill.

--Did he like it?

--Uh, yeah. He liked it all right. He didn&#146;t want to come home. Had to 
take a semester off school when he came back and see a therapist. 
Reverse culture shock, they said. He still wants to go back now...

--I...see...I replied, a little stunned to hear that.

--So, are you from Nagasaki, like Th&eacute;r&egrave;se?

--No...our school is in Musashino, in Tokyo. I live near there...

--Oh. Okay. What&#146;s cool to see around there? I wanna visit.

--What? Well...

--Why don&#146;t you tell her about your family&#146;s temple? offered Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--WHAT?

Erika looked at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, as if in disbelief, then back at me, overjoyed, 
her eyes almost seeming to sparkle with delight. I found myself noticing 
Erika had very nice eyes, a pretty shade of blue.

--Your family owns a temple? Can I touch you?

Saying that Erika reached out, making as if to do just that. I froze, 
looking up at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se for help. Erika must have noticed my shock, 
because she dropped her hand, and laughed.

--Just kidding!

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se laughed politely, but I couldn&#146;t help noticing a cloud come over 
her expression for just a second.

--So what&#146;s it called? Erika asked. I wanna visit it now.

--Shoguji, I said, writing the Chinese characters out for her, without 
waiting to be asked. My father is the priest there...would you like to 
visit? It&#146;s a small temple. It&#146;s not very famous...

--Heck, I don&#146;t care, Erika replied, shrugging. It&#146;s your temple. It&#146;s 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s friend&#146;s temple. Yeah, I wanna visit. I&#146;ll bring Th&eacute;r&egrave;se with 
me, she said, smiling up at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--I don&#146;t think...started Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, grinning a bit nervously.

--Sure you do. I need someone to come with me and do the talking.

She giggled, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se giggled too, still a bit nervously. I realized 
it must be a standing joke between them.

--Do you...go to Marianopolis too? I asked Erika, taking pity on 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Yeah...we have a lot of the same classes. Not today, though.

--She goes in the morning, and I go in the afternoon, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se added.

--Then you met there...?

--Nah, said Erika. We met at Villa-Maria, when she transferred in. A lot 
of

girls from Villa-Maria go to Marianopolis. God, it&#146;s like high school...

--Do you want to go to McGill?

--Nah. UQO.

--What?

--Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec en Outaouais, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--Yeah, said Erika. It&#146;s in Gatineau. My dad lives in Aylmer. He has an

IT job in Ottawa. Systems support, or something. He doesn&#146;t talk about 
it much. That&#146;s where I get my nerdiness, I think...anyway, yeah--UQO 
lets you major in cartooning. What I really wanna do is be a manga 
artist.

--A manga artist? I asked. Can you do that?

--I know. Crazy, huh? Dad&#146;s like, cool, okay, you can get a job maybe at 
an animation studio. I guess they have some in Ottawa. I can do that, 
maybe... But he&#146;s cool. He says I can live with him while I&#146;m in UQO. 
Whatever makes you happy, he says. I love my daddy...

Erika giggled again, adding, as if to apologize:

--I&#146;m sorry. Always been a daddy&#146;s girl...

--No...it&#146;s all right. I like my father very much too...

--Oh yeah?

She giggled, and I found myself giggling too. I could see why Th&eacute;r&egrave;se 
liked her. It was hard not to--amazingly friendly and cheerful, even 
with strangers.

A bit bubbly, to be sure, but that was all right--Yumi was no worse, 
really.

--He got me the shirt, which is funny, Erika went on, indicating the 
shirt she was wearing. He found it on the Internet. He was the one who 
told me about the OS-tans. And he doesn&#146;t even like anime that much. 
Cute shirt, huh?

--So you can get a job doing animation, in Ottawa?

--Maybe.

Erika&#146;s smile faded at the thought.

--You don&#146;t want that?

--Uh, no. I love my dad, but seriously, Ottawa? Do you have any idea 
what a boring city that is? I don&#146;t want to stay in Canada at all. I 
want to work for a studio in Japan.

--You speak Japanese? I asked.

--No. I&#146;m learning though, said Erika, looking up at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se 
endearingly. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is helping me. Right?

--I wonder if I am...I&#146;m not a very good teacher yet, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--But, I had to ask, you don&#146;t like Ottawa. Do you not like Montreal?

--No. Montreal&#146;s okay. I just don&#146;t wanna live with my mom anymore. 
God...I tell her what I want to do and she&#146;s like...

Erika went on in what I gathered was a thick foreign accent, a parody,

presumably, of her mother&#146;s:

--&#147;You can&#146;t survive, drawing cartoons! You need to find a job doing 
something useful. And you need to find a husband.&#148; God. Mom, this is the 
21st century, and this is Canada, okay? She&#146;s from Poland. More Catholic 
than the pope. My dad&#146;s a Canadian, so he&#146;s actually sort of normal. 
So...yeah. Match made in hell. But she didn&#146;t want a divorce, so when he 
got a job in Ottawa me and Mom just stayed behind. More Catholic than 
the pope...seriously. True story. When the Pope died, she went to the 
memorial mass, and when they showed the funeral on TV from Rome she was 
doing the sign of the cross in the living room along with the priest, 
and genuflecting and...

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s smile faded; she broke in with:

--Heloise, you said you&#146;d done some new drawings?

Erika must have gotten the message, because she answered:

--Um...yeah. I did. Okay, ignore me. Me and my mom just don&#146;t get 
along... Th&eacute;r&egrave;se wants to be a nun, but she&#146;s actually nice...not like 
the nuns at school. Even if she&#146;s way too quiet. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, you need to 
talk more.

--Do I? asked Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had had no trouble talking to me; but around Erika it was true

she had been much quieter. It was different with Erika, perhaps.

--Yeah, you do, said Erika.

--I was listening.

--You need to talk, too. You&#146;re too serious. Shimako! Are all Japanese 
people so serious?

--Are they very serious? I replied, not sure how to answer. I wonder...

--Canadians aren&#146;t serious at all, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--No, we&#146;re not. That&#146;s why you like me.

--Really?

They were looking at each other now, giggling. Another standing joke.

--May I see the drawings? I asked.

--Sure, said Erika, reaching down behind the desk and pulling out a 
large

binder. You can come behind the counter, if you wanna see better.

I did not refuse. I stood to one side of Erika, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to the 
other, as

Erika leafed through her portfolio, telling us a little about each 
drawing and painting. Very willowy art, reminiscent of many girls&#146; manga 
I had read.

She had probably learned to draw by copying them. Prominent in many of 
the drawings she showed us was a character, slender and beautiful with 
short orange hair, often in the arms of a handsome man.

--The girl with orange hair...is that you? I asked.

--Uh, that&#146;s a boy, said Erika.

--Oh...sorry, I said, giggling with embarrassment.

--&#145;Sokay, I get that a lot. I don&#146;t really have orange hair, ya know. 
But it&#146;s his natural colour. He&#146;s orange everywhere.

Erika smirked, and had to cover my mouth not to let my embarrassment 
show to much. She really did remind of Sei just then. Behind her I saw 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se blush, try not to laugh, and furtively make the sign of the 
cross.

--Did Th&eacute;r&egrave;se make the sign of the cross just now? asked Erika.

--Yes, I said. How did you know that?

--She always does when I say something like that.

She turned the page. A young woman with long flowing black hair, dressed 
as a shrine maiden, stood before a path leading towards a torii, holding 
a broom to sweep away the falling autumn leaves.

--This one&#146;s pretty new. I like how the colours turned out. Even if it 
is really the path up to the school. I just took out the school and 
added the torii...say, do you wear something like that?

--No...I said. That dress is Shinto. My temple is Buddhist. When I work 
at festivals...I wear kimono.

--Huh. Okay.

Erika seemed to look me up and down just then, before adding:

--I bet you look cute in a kimono. I wanna see that now...

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se kept quiet. She had clearly seen most of the drawings before; 
she was smiling and nodding a little indulgently, the way Noriko would 
do for her sister when she brought a drawing or a painting home from 
school, less pleased at the artwork itself as the fact that the one she 
loved was so proud of it, happy to see her happy. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was standing 
very close to Erika. Erika did not seem to mind that at all; but 
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s shoulder came only to a hair&#146;s breadth from Erika&#146;s, her hand 
at most a hair&#146;s breadth from Erika&#146;s, never once touching...perhaps 
longing, but not daring to touch her.

Another of Erika&#146;s latest drawings, was of two magical girls, one in a 
yellow uniform, one in red, the one in yellow in the arms of the one in 
red, both looking deeply into each other&#146;s eyes. They both wore 
headdresses that looked like nothing so much as TV antennae.

--That&#146;s Naoko and Reiko from Testcard Warriors, said Erika by way of 
commentary. They&#146;re so delightfully yuri. I&#146;ve been drawing a lot more 
girls lately. Go figure...must be the yuri manga I&#146;ve been reading...you 
know what?

I should sign up for artist&#146;s alley at Otakuthon next year.

--Otakuthon? I asked.

--It&#146;s an anime convention. At Concordia. See if I can&#146;t get some fan 
art commissions...oh!

Erika looked at Th&eacute;r&egrave;se with a knowing smirk, and added:

--Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! You know you want to cosplay Esther!

--What? said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, laughing. No!

--Esther? I asked.

Erika flipped forward to another of her recent drawings, a beautiful,

pale man in a dark cloak and a beautiful young woman with huge,

pleading eyes, dressed in a white, Italian-style habit.

--From Trinity Blood. The guy is Father Abel and the girl is Sister 
Esther.

It&#146;d be perfect.

--I couldn&#146;t do that! laughed Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

--You know you want to. You make your own clothes, right? You could make 
it

no problem.

--No!

--What? Too sacrilegious? You&#146;re a nun! You need to dress like one, 
right?

--I&#146;d look stupid!

--So? I&#146;ll go as Abel if you like.

--NO!

They both were laughing now. Another standing joke. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was 
blushing, clearly enjoying the teasing. I found myself laughing too.

--I love making her squirm, said Erika as if divulging a confidence to 
me. It&#146;s so much fun.

--Really? I said.

--And she&#146;s so cute when she blushes.

--Stop it! said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, trying to contain herself now, but not quite

succeeding.

--Seriously though, said Erika (finally having mercy on Th&eacute;r&egrave;se), it&#146;s 
fun. If you go to McGill you should come, Shimako. To Otakuthon.

--Is it? Do Canadians like manga that much?

--Sure they do. And you&#146;re Japanese. You and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;ll be, like, the 
only Japanese people there. Folks&#146;ll love you...it&#146;ll be an 
experience...you should bring your friend too...what&#146;s your friend&#146;s 
name?

--Sei, I said. Sei Sato.

At the sound of Sei&#146;s name, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se suddenly sobered up, and said:

--That&#146;s right. Weren&#146;t you supposed to meet Sei for lunch?

--Yes, I said. Yes, I was.

--I&#146;m sorry, Heloise, said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, I have to go. I have to get to 
class.

--Already? said Erika.

--Anyway...Shimako doesn&#146;t know this part of town well. I took her well 
out of her way. I was going to take her back to the metro, so she 
doesn&#146;t get lost.

--But it&#146;s like, right there...

--I know...but she doesn&#146;t know the metro that well, so...

--Huh. Okay, said Erika, looking rather dejected.

--Heloise?

--Yes?

--I just had a thought. You will have to wear the dress, but I can make 
it

for you.

--...Seriously? You mean it?

--When I make a promise, I keep it. Give me pictures and I&#146;ll find 
fabric.

--I love you!

Erika grinned and giggled, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se laughed too, then they were both 
quiet

a moment, looking in each other&#146;s eyes. When I made my way out from 
behind

the counter, they seemed barely to notice. I pretended to take great 
interest

in a magazine with a picture of a pretty high school girl wearing yellow

ribbons on the front cover.

--You would make a prettier Esther anyway, I heard Th&eacute;r&egrave;se say.

--Oh, you think so? said Erika, sounding flattered. Do tell...!

--Esther...she&#146;s English. Not Japanese. I really would look silly. You 
look much more like her.

--Hmm...yeah, okay. I&#146;ll give you my measurements. Remind me.

--I have to go.

--Not yet. Come here.

--But...is it all right?

--No buts. Come here.

--All right...

--Mmm...

I looked at them out of the corner of my eye. They were embracing very 
tightly, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s back to me, Erika&#146;s face buried in Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s 
shoulder, her hands moving ever so slowly up and down Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#146;s back.

It was at that moment I realized who the shrine maiden was. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se with 
longer hair.

I looked back in the magazine, pretending I had seen nothing.

--Shimako?

I looked up. They had let go. Erika was looking at me now.

--You want French manga, right?

--Oh. Yes, please, I said (though to be honest I&#146;d forgotten about it).

--Go to March&eacute; du Livre. That&#146;s where I get mine. Hold on, I&#146;ll make

you a map.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se came out from behind the counter, and we waited while Erika drew 
the

map. As she handed it to me she said:

--Go to Berri-UQAM and head for the bus station--Station Centrale. It&#146;s

right next door on our left, on Maisonneuve. You can&#146;t miss it.

--Thank you, I said.

--No problem...if you go to McGill I&#146;ll see you again, maybe?

--I&#146;d like that, I replied.

--Shall we go? said Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to me, in Japanese.

--All right...nice meeting you, Erika, I said, bowing before heading 
behind

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se towards the door.

--Bye...later, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.

Erika waved as we went, smiling again, now a little sadly.

--

As we stepped outside of the store and started walking back towards the 
station, the smile Th&eacute;r&egrave;se kept for Erika faded; replacing it was

apprehension, a shade of guilt. She must have noticed me looking at her, 
because she turned to me and asked, as if trying to distract me:

--Do you want something to drink?

--I&#39;m fine, I said. I&#39;ll wait until lunch.

--Not even water? It&#39;s all right. I&#39;m thirsty too.

--There&#39;s no need.

--I insist.

So Th&eacute;r&egrave;se stepped into D&eacute;panneur Reine Camel, coming out with two 
bottles of cheap bottled water. We didn&#39;t go directly to the station, 
but rather walked onto the bridge over the freeway a little way, and we 
stood there a few minutes, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looking out onto the freeway, 
watching the cars roll by through the drizzle.

--So why do you call her Heloise? I asked.

--That&#39;s her name.

--But isn&#39;t it Erika?

--No. It&#39;s a Japanese name as well as an English one. She wanted a 
Japanese name, so she gave herself one. She hates the name Heloise. Even 
her brother calls her Erika now.

--She doesn&#39;t mind?

--Not really. I told her I liked it, and I meant it. I even told her 
about

Abelard and Heloise.

--The priest and nun who fell in love?

--Yes. She didn&#39;t even know that. She said her mother just liked the 
sound of it. There&#39;s only three people she lets call her Heloise. One&#39;s 
her mother.

The second&#146;s her father. The third is me.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se turned to me, smiling again, but a little sheepishly, adding:

--She teases me about that too.

--She&#146;s right. You are very quiet around her, I replied.

--Am I? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se asked. I suppose I am. You saw though--it&#146;s hard to keep 
up with her. For a long time I didn&#146;t have much choice but to let her do 
the talking. I learned to speak English from her, did I mention that?

--No, you didn&#146;t.

--Yes. That&#146;s why I&#146;m trying to teach her Japanese. I owe her a lot, you 
know.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se turned back to the traffic, sipped her water, and went on:

--Even if I&#146;d been a Canadian, the other girls would have thought me 
odd.

None of them thought for a minute about being a nun. And I didn&#146;t speak

English, not really. It&#146;s no wonder they had no patience with me. Then 
there

was Heloise, who wanted to be friends and wouldn&#146;t take no for an 
answer!

She laughed at the memory, and continued:

--She&#146;s always enthusiastic like that. It&#146;s exhausting sometimes. So 
much so that I&#146;ll spend an hour with her, and after I&#146;ll be sure that 
I&#146;ve had enough of her for at least a month! But it passes. I can&#146;t stay 
angry with her for long. We get on well. She&#146;s a fun person.

Her smile faded just then, though, as she added:

--That&#146;s the odd part about it. I always enjoyed being with her. But she 
didn&#146;t make friends easily with anybody else. She wasn&#146;t that close to 
any of the other girls. And boys she barely seemed to see the use for. I 
sometimes wondered if I was her only friend...

Her voice trailed off. She took another sip of water.

--You think about her quite a lot, don&#146;t you? I asked.

--Do I?...Yes, I suppose I do.

--Does she know about Sei and Shiori?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked back at me, surprised, not to say shocked at the 
question.

--Why should she know about that?

--Th&eacute;r&egrave;se...It&#146;s obvious to anyone. Heloise adores you. I thought 
perhaps that&#146;s why she gave you the books. To tell you it was all 
right...

--It&#146;s not all right!

I found myself jumping back at the sound of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se shouting at the top 
of her lungs. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se herself must have been shocked, because she caught 
herself, hung her head, and said:

--I&#146;m sorry...

--Don&#146;t be.

--Long ago I was promised to the Lord, all of me. When I forget that 
I&#146;ve

regretted it. Of course I know. She wants something from me I can&#146;t give 
her.

--Why not? Don&#146;t you like her?

--Of course I do.

--Then...

--Her innocence. That&#146;s what I came to love about her.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked back up at me, an imploring look in her eyes.

--Shimako--if I led her astray...it wouldn&#146;t be the first time. 
Please... don&#146;t ask me to do that again. I don&#146;t care to make any more 
promises I can&#146;t keep. Our Lady of Mercy...she gave me a second chance, 
in Canada, as if I&#146;d deserved anything of the kind. Heloise--I give her 
what I can. Companionship.

A friendly ear. Now and again I&#146;ll make her a dress--a costume. She 
appreciates that. Beyond that--I pray for her.

--Pray?

--Yes. Every day. That she&#146;ll find someone who can give himself--all of

himself--to her. And forget me once and for all.

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se finished her water, and as if to declared the subject closed, 
said:

--Do the sisters know? I asked.

--What? About Sei and Shiori?

--Yes.

--They might know. Mother Superior wrote my recommendation. They might 
have found it odd that someone would come all this way to their school 
for no reason. I&#146;d be surprised if they didn&#146;t ask.

--I mean...are they sure you belong in the Congr&eacute;gation?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se looked back at me and raised her right hand, pointing to her 
fingers with her left index.

--Shimako. Do you know how many women took vows--what, this year? I 
could count them on the fingers of one hand. Literally. And that&#39;s not 
just the Congr&eacute;gation de Notre Dame, that&#39;s all the orders in Quebec. 
I&#146;m needed, more than ever. That&#146;s not all. After hearing Yes for so 
long--how can it be that Our Lady would want to hear No?

--You don&#146;t have to say no to her. You want to teach children? To spread 
the word of God? You don&#146;t have to be a sister to do that!

--Why don&#146;t you understand? I can&#146;t just say no to my family, or to 
Mother Superior, after all they&#146;ve done for me! My family would turn out 
on the

street, probably, and I&#39;d deserve every bit of it. No home, no job, not 
even

a way back to Japan. Then what? What good would that do anyone?

I found myself answering:

--Th&eacute;r&egrave;se...what sort of horrible people are they that they would do 
that? Sacrificing a little girl to Our Lady for services rendered? 
Sending her halfway across the world to punish her for falling in love? 
And they call themselves Christians? They had no right! And no need! 
When Christ died for us did he send us a bill? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se...listen. You 
have a real family waiting for you. People who love you, really love 
you, miss you. Waiting for you to come to them. The second chance Our 
Lady gave you...did you never think it might be Heloise?

--So...what? Shall I squat at Heloise&#146;s father&#146;s place in Ottawa, 
perhaps? Don&#39;t make me laugh!

--Not just her, I said. Sei&#39;s here too.

--What?

I grabbed her wrist, and tried to pull her with me towards Villa-Maria

station, but after the shock wore off she pulled her arm back.

--Come with me, I said. I&#39;ll take you to her.

--What? NO! Are you mad?

Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was clearly now truly angry. She shook her arm up and down 
trying force me to let her go free, but I resisted as best I could, 
trying to get her to submit, not quite knowing what I was saying:

--I&#39;m not mad. She&#39;ll help you, of course she will. She lives on rue 
Panet. In the Village. She has friends there. They&#39;ll help you. They 
look after her too. I&#39;ll be coming here, I&#39;ll help you if I can. She&#39;ll 
help you too.

--You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! Let me go!

--Sei doesn&#39;t hate you. I know she doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve never known her to hate 
anyone. She never said one bad thing about you, not one. She forgave you 
long ago. Come with me and let her see you again. She&#39;ll be so happy...

--Get behind me, Satan!

The words seemed to work like the spell they were. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se forced her 
arm free so suddenly she was falling backwards, off the sidewalk onto 
the pavement.

The next sound I heard was screeching tires and a blaring horn.
