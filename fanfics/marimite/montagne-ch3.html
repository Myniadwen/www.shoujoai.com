<h1>Les filles du lys de montagne (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pcorrigan.html">Paul Corrigan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/montagne-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>I asked Sei as we stepped into Beaudry station that evening:

--Is the club we&#39;re going to very far away?

--Not really. We&#39;re only going to Berri-UQ&Agrave;M. I just remembered I need 
to get you a metro card.

We walked down the steps to the turnstile, and Sei asked the attendant:

--Une carte de trois jours, s&#39;il vous pla&icirc;t.

--Seize dollars.

Sei passed him a bill, and the attendant passed her back a card which 
she immediately handed to me, which read CARTE TOURISTIQUE.

--Guard that with your life. Show it to the attendant and they&#39;ll let 
you through.

--I could have paid for that on my own, I protested (though I admit not 
too forcefully).

--Pay me back when you&#39;re rich and famous.

Sei ran her pass through the reader and walked through, waiting for me 
to show the pass to the attendant and walk through myself before she 
stepped on the moving sidewalk.

--So...is Berri-UQ&Agrave;M still in the Village?

--Not as such, why?

--I just thought we&#39;d be going to a club you went to often.

--We are. I go to this club all the time...why? You thought I was taking 
you to a lesbian club?

Sei was looking at me as if I&#39;d lost my wits. Sei Sato had never made a 
secret of her attraction to women. However, this was the first time I 
had heard her breathe the word &quot;lesbian,&quot; and now she spat the word as 
if it were an obscenity.

--Why? You want to go to one? she went on. There&#39;s actually not that 
many in the Village. There&#39;s one near Peel station I go to 
sometimes...you want to go there, instead? I don&#39;t mind...

It was perfectly obvious that she did.

--No, it&#39;s all right. I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have jumped to conclusions 
like that...

--No, it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s just...I figured that&#39;d be the last place you&#39;d 
want me to take you. Coming?

So saying, Sei stepped on the moving sidewalk, and after a moment&#39;s 
hesitation I stepped on myself, following her slowly down into the 
station.

I --

--Et pour boire, mam&#39;zelle?

--Une Maudite. Do you know what you want, Shimako?

--I should probably have hot chocolate, I said.

Rue Saint-Denis was lined with old townhouses that had been converted 
into any number of fashionable bars and caf&eacute;s. Juliette et Chocolat, 
which (Sei had assured me) sold the best French cr&ecirc;pes in Montreal and 
the best hot chocolate in the civilized world as far as she knew, was in 
the lower level of one of them.

There were two motifs to the d&eacute;cor. Chocolate, of course, was one of 
them. Framed prints of vintage advertisements for chocolate hung on the 
walls; beside our table was a poster showing a child peering into a 
bird&#39;s nest containing a chocolate bar, the caption reading CHOCOLAT 
NESTL&Eacute;. The other, oddly enough, was roses; the menus had drawings of 
red roses on the front cover, and on the wall behind the counter (just 
above Sei&#39;s head, from my perspective) was a large lamp made of red 
paper suggesting a large red rose.

Juliette et chocolat was obviously popular, metal tables and wicker 
chairs occupied by groups of girlfriends as well as couples, some man 
and woman, some two women. I couldn&#39;t help thinking it should have been 
the Rosas Chinensis here instead of the Rosas Gigantea. Perhaps it was 
somewhere like this that Toko had in mind for her date with Yumi. Sei 
for her part had never been the sort to take her petite soeur out on 
&quot;dates.&quot; I admit her apparent determination to treat me like a princess 
the whole time I was in Montreal was rather flattering.

--You don&#39;t have to have chocolate, said Sei. I&#39;m having a beer. You 
wanna order something stronger?

--I don&#39;t think I should, I replied.

--You&#39;re sure? You&#39;re eighteen, now, right? You&#39;re legal here.

--We don&#39;t drink in my family, I said, a bit too firmly.

--Oh. Right. No meat, then, either, I guess?

--No, thank you.

--Okay. Pour mon amie, une V&eacute;g&eacute;tarienne pis un noir mi-amer &agrave; 
l&#39;ancienne.

--Okay, said the waitress, writing down our orders. Une minute.

She went off to see about our food, and Sei said to me:

--You can take the girl away from the Buddha, but you can&#39;t take the 
Buddha away from the girl.

--Is that bad?

--Not always.

The waitress brought Sei a glass and a bottle of beer, most of which Sei 
poured into the glass and immediately drank down without stopping to 
breathe.

--I ought to warn you, though, Sei went on, you might get pretty warm in 
the club wearing that sweater.

Sei herself had changed her top before we left, exchanging her white 
sweater for a black t-shirt so tight it seemed to be painted on her.

--I was afraid you would be cold, wearing that. This is the lightest top 
I brought with me. And the nicest. Don&#39;t you like it?

--No, I do. Just saying. You don&#39;t have to wear so many clothes all the 
time. It&#39;s cold in Canada, but they do have central heating. I guess you 
wouldn&#39;t do this much at home, eh? Go clubbing, I mean.

--Is that all right?

--Well, yeah. I&#39;d be more worried if you were partying every weekend. 
What, you think I had time to go to clubs in my senior year? You are 
indeed privileged, my dear, Sei added, winking, for tonight&#39;s &quot;Train 
Shimako for College&quot; night.

It was not, I should add, as if I had never had the opportunity to go to 
a club. Rei Hasekura had invited Yoshino Shimazu to a club near her 
university for Yoshino&#39;s eighteenth birthday; Yoshino had invited me and 
Yumi to come with her, but we had both turned her down (we both had a 
mock exam the next day). When we asked her about it the day after, just 
before the Yamiyurikai meeting, Yoshino claimed to have had quite a nice 
time, though it would have been nothing short of heavenly (Yoshino 
claimed) if Rei hadn&#39;t been visibly upset at the idea of Yoshino dancing 
with any of the boys at the club.

--She wanted to spend time with you on your birthday. You didn&#39;t just 
ignore her the whole night, I hope? I&#39;d offered, perfectly sure Yoshino, 
who was nothing if not jealous of Rei, wouldn&#39;t have done anything of 
the kind.

--We could have spent time together at home! Yoshino replied. It wasn&#39;t 
like I was going to leave with some guy I didn&#39;t even know. I&#39;m not 
stupid. I wanted to have fun on my birthday. Rei needs to loosen up. Is 
she really going to treat me like I&#39;m made of glass for the rest of my 
life?

We might never have learned the real reason why Rei had been so upset if 
a hot-headed freshman from the Journalism Club had not barged into the 
Yamiyurikai meeting room a few minutes later. She was not asking for 
permission to publish the photos she had taken of Rosa Foetida letting 
at least three men deep-kiss and fondle her on the dance floor of the 
club; she simply wished to know if Rosa Foetida had any comment that she 
could add to the article that she assured us was going in the 
newspaper&#39;s next issue.

I wonder if the freshman was satisfied when Rosa Foetida was so 
absolutely thunderstruck at the question as to be rendered mute on the 
spot.

Rosa Chinensis, however, merely looked the photos over calmly, then 
folded her hands and coldly asked the young reporter:

--May I ask, miss, what a freshman from Lillian Academy was doing in a 
club for university students in the first place? Do you plan to explain 
that in your article? And may I ask how else you are qualified to write 
about adults?

Sei poured the rest of the beer into her glass, drank it in one gulp, 
and showed me the label on the bottle, which depicted men paddling a 
canoe in the middle of the air.

--Here we go. That&#39;s the magic canoe from the chasse-galerie story, she 
said. They&#39;re flying over Montreal. This is the Basilique Notre-Dame 
over here, and over here&#39;s the Oratoire St-Joseph. Excusez, une autre 
Maudite?

--Bien s&ucirc;r.

If the waitress, who was just then serving me my chocolate in a small 
china pot usually used to serve tea, was surprised to see how quickly 
Sei had drunk her beer, she did not let it show.

The chocolate itself was dark, not too sweet, very thick, and as Sei had 
promised, easily the best I had ever tasted.

--So, said Sei, after taking a long swig of beer, how&#39;s Noriko? She 
still helping out at Shoguji?

I should have expected Sei to ask about Noriko sooner or later, but I 
hadn&#39;t expected it to be the first question out of her mouth. I put down 
my chocolate, suddenly unable to look at her, saying nothing.

--Did I say something wrong? she asked.

--No...it&#39;s just...I started.

--Wait...on your arm. Is that the rosary I gave you?

I really ought to have known better than to leave the rosary on my arm. 
As I&#39;d lifted my arm to drink my chocolate, my sweater had ridden up my 
arm a bit farther than I&#39;d thought it would, revealing the rosary for 
all to see.

--Yes, it is.

--I thought you gave my rosary to Noriko...

--I didn&#39;t.

--You didn&#39;t?

--She borrowed it. That&#39;s how she put it when she asked to be my soeur. 
The other day she gave it back.
--What?

Sei put down her beer and looked at me, clearly in shock.

--She gave you back your rosary? Sweet Jesus, why? She doesn&#39;t want to 
be Rosa Gigantea any more? Or did you guys have a fight?

--It wasn&#39;t like that...

--Oh for...

As if for punctuation Sei drained the rest of her beer. The waitress was 
just then bringing us our cr&ecirc;pes.

--Une autre Maudite, said Sei.

--Oui...bien s&ucirc;r. Un instant.

The waitress put down the cr&ecirc;pes in front of us and went to fetch Sei 
another beer.

--Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re drinking too fast? I had to ask.

--No. Shimako, what&#39;s going on here? Is she angry at you about 
something?

--It wasn&#39;t like that...She seemed almost happy...

--Votre Maudite, mam&#39;zelle, said the waitress, who had come with Sei&#39;s 
beer.

--Merci.

Sei poured out her third beer, drank a large swallow and went on:

--Happy about what? Someone flings your rosary in your face, they&#39;re 
usually pretty damned unhappy...

--She didn&#39;t fling it in my face! Sei...you don&#39;t know Noriko the way I 
do. She&#39;d never do anything like that. She didn&#39;t make a fuss at all. 
She didn&#39;t even want anybody else to know. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve 
told.

--Then what was the point of giving it back?

--Well...I&#39;d told her I was going here to look at universities, 
but...when she found out you were here, she took me aside and gave it 
back to me. I didn&#39;t want to take it, but she insisted...If you don&#39;t 
want it, she said, give it back to Sei Sato when you get to Montreal.

--What? Why? Shimako, I gave you that rosary. I don&#39;t want it back. You 
can tell Noriko that too. If she doesn&#39;t want it, tell her to throw it 
away if she&#39;s...

--I think...I think it was her way of saying I belonged with you.

--Belonged with me? What&#39;s that supposed to...

Sei trailed off, her eyes suddenly going wide. She took another sip of 
beer before going on:

--Does she know about me?

--Yes. Yes, she does.

--Who told her? You?

--No. Toko Matsudaira.

--You could have, you know. I wouldn&#39;t actually have minded.

--I didn&#39;t think it mattered.

--Shimako, are you trying to tell me Noriko thought we were a couple?

--Yes. I think so.

--Shit.

--What?

--I said shit.

Sei took a long sip of her beer, as if for punctuation, before going on:

--What the hell gave her that idea? How often do we even see each other 
any more? And even if we did...

Sei put down her beer, looked me in the eye, and added:

--She&#39;s got to know you&#39;re not like that. You told her that, right?

It was not an accusation. It was not even a question. Sei Sato, the one 
person I was sure would have immediately figured out the truth, could 
not even imagine that I could possibly have done what I did with Noriko 
Nijo, what I was sure was written all over my face in a script Sei, of 
all people, could easily read had she wanted to. She could not--no, she 
would not see.

I hesitated for far too long.

--Right? said Sei.

--I told her we were never like that, but she didn&#39;t listen. There was 
nothing I could do...

--You didn&#39;t have to take the rosary back. You should have said, no, 
that&#39;s yours. You keep that...

--She&#39;s a lot like you, you know, I finally managed to say.

--How&#39;s that? said Sei. She likes hitting on cute girls?

--No, no...I mean she&#39;s her own person. Anything she does, it&#39;s because 
she wants to do it. She has a horror of hierarchy too, even in the 
Yamiyurikai. She never even calls me oneesama. I couldn&#39;t just force her 
to take my rosary back, even if I&#39;d wanted to...it wasn&#39;t that she 
wasn&#39;t jealous of me, like Yumi used to be with Sachiko. You were never 
possessive of me either. She knew I was fond of you. It&#39;s not as if I&#39;d 
forgotten you. She never held it against me before. She must have 
thought she couldn&#39;t ever compare to you...that she wasn&#39;t really worthy 
of me. She was really sweet about it, as if she had done something 
wrong...

--So...what? You think she thinks you became soeurs because she reminded 
you of me? That&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to say?

--Something like that.

--And there was absolutely nothing you could do or say to change her 
mind?

--No. She began our relationship, she ended it. I&#39;m sorry. I should have 
been more assertive, shouldn&#39;t I?
--Cheer up. It&#39;s not your fault, okay?

Sei was smiling at me almost maternally now.

--Eat your crepe before it gets cold, all right? We&#39;re supposed to be 
having fun here, eh? Her loss, anyway...

--Do you find that strange? I asked Sei, as I started to eat.

--What?

--It could be true. She did remind me a lot of you. I must be attracted 
to that kind of person...

Now it was Sei&#39;s smile that faded. She picked up her glass and took 
another sip of beer, the look in her eyes contemplative, faraway, a 
little sad.

--No, I don&#39;t find it strange at all.

--Sei?

--Hm?

--What was the reason you picked me as your soeur?

By way of response Sei leaned in really close until I could smell the 
beer on her breath, and whispered in my ear:

--&#39;Cause I like your face...

--You&#39;re drunk!

Sei laughed out loud at my obvious irritation.

--Good. That means I&#39;m ready for the club. How&#39;s your food?

--Fine, I said. Sei, I&#39;m asking a serious question...

Sei drained her beer and went on, more seriously, playing with the glass 
as she did so:

--That&#39;s what oneesama said to me. When she asked me to be her soeur, I 
mean. I was like, fine, whatever...

--And that&#39;s why she made you her soeur?

--Why, did she need a better reason? She liked me for some reason. I can 
think of worse reasons than that, like--I don&#39;t know. Trying to get out 
of the school play, or because her grande soeur told her to, like 
Sachiko. Maybe I like people like you. That&#39;s not a crime, eh? You&#39;re 
thinking about it too hard, Shimako. I liked you. I didn&#39;t need a reason 
to like having you around, did I? I&#39;ll have another for the road. 
Serveuse? Une autre Maudite pis un verre d&#39;eau. Shimako, you want 
anything else?

--No, I&#39;m fine.

--Vous &ecirc;tes s&ucirc;re, mam&#39;zelle? asked the waitress. &Ccedil;a serait votre 
quatri&egrave;me...

--Ouais, chus s&ucirc;re, Sei answered, a little gruffly. C&#39;est correct?

--Oui, bien s&ucirc;r.

The waitress did not try to argue further, but did look apprehensive as 
she went off to fetch another bottle of beer.

--Do you normally drink this much, Sei? I asked.

--It&#39;s a special occasion. And it makes me hungry for my supper. 
Mmm...cr&ecirc;pe.

Sei had hardly touched her cr&ecirc;pe while we had been talking; now, though, 
she dove into it, polishing it off at breakneck speed.

--Anyway, Sei went on, in between bites, I don&#39;t know why people liked 
my face. I never did.

--Why not?

--People were always thinking my father was white. I mean, I do look 
like my dad, but he&#39;s Japanese. Of course, grandma raised him on her 
own. For all I know my granddad really was a Marine. I don&#39;t know, and 
it&#39;s not like she&#39;s telling. That&#39;s why dad&#39;s a self-made man. Wasn&#39;t 
high class enough for anyone to do him any favours...Anyway, it was a 
real pain in the ass. I hated it. Of course, then I come to Canada, and 
I tell actual white people that, like Madeleine, and they&#39;re like, you 
look Asian to me...I dunno. Guess I should chalk it down to training.

--For being a foreigner?

--Among other things. Fitting in isn&#39;t something I&#39;m good at.

I had in fact always liked Sei Sato&#39;s face: her light-coloured hair, her 
round, grey eyes. I had not been the only one, least of all at Lillian 
Academy. Her exotic good looks were a perfect contrast to that of the 
classically Japanese beauty of the daughters of good families who were 
so common at Lillian, like Yoko Mizuno or Sachiko Ogasawara-
or, when I thought of it, Noriko Nijo. Nobody at Lillian would ever have 
mistaken Noriko for anything but Japanese.

Sei finally finished her cr&ecirc;pe, and picked up her water glass to take a 
drink of water.

--Don&#39;t you fit in here?

--Hm? What you mean? said Sei, looking up.

--I mean...here you&#39;re with people who are like you, right?

Sei gave me a withering look, and replied rather dryly:

--Miss Shimako, what we have here is a failure to communicate. I didn&#39;t 
say I moved out here because I thought Canada was lesbian la-la land, 
did I? If I wanted to hang out with lesbians I could have done it in 
Japan. Not like I didn&#39;t know where to find them, down in Shinjuku. 
Hell, I didn&#39;t even have to go there. I knew where they were at Lillian 
U. I didn&#39;t hang out with you because I thought you were a lesbian, 
right? Listen. In Canada I don&#39;t get treated like some freak of nature. 
Which is great. I can go days, weeks sometimes, without people reminding 
me I&#39;m a lesbian. Without even having to think about it. I can just be 
me. Shimako, this may come as a shock, but the fact is I don&#39;t hang out 
with lesbians very much. That club I told you about? I haven&#39;t been 
there in months.

--You&#39;re right. I&#39;m sorry...

--No need to be sorry, it&#39;s just...if you really want to know, I don&#39;t 
even like a lot of lesbians. I&#39;m even thinking of switching majors.

--From Women&#39;s Studies? Why?

--It&#39;s like--have you ever spent time with some of these people? They 
spend every day of their lives thinking about how they&#39;re lesbians and 
how great the world will be when they can stop men from fucking it 
up...oh, and if you have a moment to yourself that you don&#39;t spent 
fighting for women&#39;s issues you&#39;re not really a lesbian...That&#39;s it! 
They remind me of the nuns. You know how people say the nuns are all 
closeted lesbians? I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s the other way around. You 
know? It&#39;s like a cult or something. That&#39;s the sort of thing I was 
trying to get away from...I don&#39;t want to be a member of the lesbian 
club. I&#39;m not a joiner, never was...

--Neither is Noriko, I said.

--Hm? What makes you say that? Sei asked.

--I was just thinking of Noriko just now. Toko Matsudaira drives her 
crazy, trying to get her to join clubs and be her friend...

--Oh yeah, Sei replied, laughing. Yoko used to want me to do that 
too...I feel for the kid...

--You really are very much alike, you know. You&#39;d like her...

--Yeah, well...

Sei took another sip of water and went on:

--Anyway, most of my friends in Montreal are gay guys, actually. I feel 
a lot more comfortable around them. Don&#39;t take themselves nearly as 
seriously, that&#39;s for sure. They have much more fun. All those clubs 
along rue Sainte-Catherine in the Village? Almost all of them are gay 
clubs. I can relax, have a beer, not worry about the guys in there 
trying to pick me up. Safest place for a woman on God&#39;s green earth. 
Point being if I&#39;m going to hang out with anybody, it&#39;d better be with 
people I actually like...

--Like me?

Sei looked at me a moment, seeming to consider before smiling and 
replying:

--Yeah, like you.

She suddenly laughed and added:

--Maybe I&#39;ll switch to your department instead. We can take all the same 
classes...

--You really don&#39;t have to, I said laughing a little nervously. I wasn&#39;t 
sure if she meant it or not.

--That reminds me, Sei went on, what do you want to major in? I was 
thinking it had to be something environmental...

--What? I said. Like biology? I really don&#39;t know...my math grades 
aren&#39;t that good. I hadn&#39;t really thought about it that carefully...

--You always liked plants, right?

--Oh, I don&#39;t know, Sei...that was always more a hobby. Collecting 
gingko nuts and things...I couldn&#39;t make a living off that!

--Just saying...it might as well be something you like, eh? You&#39;ll 
probably being doing something with it for the rest of your 
life...something you&#39;re devoted to, you know? If you hate it, why 
bother?

Devotion. Sei made it sound like a vocation. Were the lesbians closeted 
nuns, as she&#39;d said? Perhaps it was she, not I, who would have made an 
excellent sister.

--I suppose I&#39;m asking...said Sei, putting down her water glass.

--Yes?

--Shimako...what do you want to do with your life?

--I&#39;m sorry?

--You used to want to be a nun...but you don&#39;t any more. What do you 
want to do?

--I&#39;m not sure I know...why? What do you want to do with your life?

Sei seemed just as ill-prepared as me for the question, finally 
answering with a chuckle:

--Not Women&#39;s Studies that&#39;s for sure.

--Sei?

--Hm?

--I was just thinking...maybe we could go to the Village and see your 
friends? I wouldn&#39;t mind meeting some of them...

--Hm? To a gay club, you mean?...I dunno. I suppose...

The idea did not seem to horrify Sei, as the idea of taking me to a 
lesbian club had done, but for all that she did not seem enthusiastic.

--You don&#39;t want to do that?

--Well...let me put it this way...we&#39;d probably be the only women there. 
They&#39;ll notice you and me, and they know me. If Madeleine thinks we&#39;re a 
couple, you bet your life they will. You sure you want that kind of 
attention? I mean, they&#39;re okay guys, most of them, but...it might be a 
bit awkward, okay? Straight club, we don&#39;t have to worry about people 
getting the wrong idea.

With that Sei finished her water, suddenly grinned and added:
--Besides, if you want me to corrupt you, we&#39;ll have to take it a step 
at a time, eh? Serveuse! La facture!

-
II --

--This all you got?

The bouncer, a heavyset white man not much older than Sei, did not 
bother addressing me in French as I gave him my passport.

--Yes, I said.

After looking at it a little longer than was probably necessary, he 
handed it back to me and said:

--All right, you&#39;re fine.

I had been glad of my sweater while standing in line for half an hour 
just to get in the door of Club Rose Latulippe, though Sei, as we had 
stood out in the cold, had assured me that the queue to get in was quite 
short compared to what one might see on Saturday night. &quot;In winter, no 
less,&quot; she&#39;d added. We&#39;d passed the time in line swapping lighter 
anecdotes about our lives since we&#39;d seen each other last; when the 
conversation dropped, I watched the other clubbers behind me in line, 
the women (I noticed) dressed not much more under their jackets than 
Sei, some even less, shivering even in what Sei assured me wasn&#39;t that 
cold an autumn night.

Through the door of the club was a staircase leading down into the 
basement. It wasn&#39;t until we had checked our coats at the cloakroom at 
the bottom of the stairs and gone through the door to the main dance 
hall that I realized that Sei had been right; the first thing I noticed 
on entering was the heat, the work of human exertion as much as anything 
else. Then again, I was glad at that point just to be inside.

The bar was just a few steps inside the door, a very modern affair, all 
black-paneled wood and glass. Sei stopped there to order a Red Bull and 
vodka for herself and (after another token attempt to get me to take 
something stronger) a glass of water for me, before leading me to the 
dance floor. The d&eacute;cor there was, for the most part, just as modern as 
the bar, a few black leather sofas and glass tables for those sitting 
out any given number, mirrors on the side walls. The back wall, just 
behind the disk jockey, was what struck me, taken up as it was entirely 
by a picture--a reproduction of a painting, perhaps--of a peasant woman 
not so much dancing with as swooning in the arms of a dark, handsome, 
well-dressed man at a long-ago country dance.

Tonight&#39;s dance was in full swing, and with the DJ playing music at full 
blast Sei had to almost shout in my ear to tell me:

--That&#39;s Rose Latulippe. The girl who danced with the devil.

Sei led me to one of the couches, where we both sat for a few minutes, 
drinking our drinks and watching the dancers. The lighting in the club 
was rather dim, the lights on the dance floor dominated by reds and 
oranges, giving the whole place, I had to admit, an infernal air. It 
must have been partly deliberate, but I still felt intimidated, and I 
was rather grateful not to be dragged immediately onto the dance floor 
by Sei.

For all that, I had expected Sei to be eager to hit the dance floor 
quickly. As it was, she sat beside me a long time in silence, sipping 
her drink, watching the dancers, not looking at me. She was not so much 
withdrawn as hesitant, looking as if trying to gather up courage.

--Aren&#39;t you going to go dance? I said (or rather shouted in Sei&#39;s ear) 
at last.

--What? Without you?

--I&#39;m not much of a dancer. Go ahead. I&#39;ll watch.

--Oh come on, Shimako! I brought you here so we could have fun, not so 
you could watch me have fun with a bunch of other people.

--What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t you see anybody here you like?

I had said that to tease her, but Sei looked at me as she said that, an 
apprehensive look suddenly in her eyes. She put down her drink and 
replied:

--I&#39;m going to the washroom. Watch my drink, eh?

I was about to offer to go with her, but suddenly thought better of it 
and watched her stand up and walk towards the sign TOILETTES at the 
corner of the floor and disappear into the adjacent corridor.

I couldn&#39;t help but guess that what was making her apprehensive was me. 
To someone like Sei I suppose it would sound like a proposition, one 
that, for all her teasing, she didn&#39;t dare accept. I couldn&#39;t help but 
remember when she had met me in the Rose Mansion after my date with 
Shizuka Kanina. I had fallen sobbing into her lap, and as she soothed me 
she had offered to give me a kiss herself, or whatever else I pleased. 
Another of her teases.

But what might have happened if I had said yes?

Mostly out of curiosity I took a sip of Sei&#39;s drink. It tasted like a 
mix of liquid gelatine and cough medicine, of no appeal to me at all, 
and I put the glass down and watched the people dance frantically, some 
in groups to amuse each other, some alone to impress the others, some in 
couples to seduce each other. I couldn&#39;t help but notice one couple, who 
were already not so much dancing as making love on the dance floor, 
embracing and deep kissing.

--Please tell me this isn&#39;t you, Yoshino...

The photographer had reluctantly left the meeting room, clearly not 
pleased to be outwitted by Rosa Chinensis, muttering darkly about 
censorship. When we were satisfied she was out of earshot Yumi pushed 
the photos towards Yoshino, a concerned look on her face.

--So what if it was? Yoshino asked.

--Yoshino, please. Don&#39;t worry about the paper. I&#39;ll talk to Tsutako. 
Don&#39;t worry about anything. I just want to know...

--Why? What&#39;s to know? I met some hot guys and got kisses out of them? 
So what? Am I supposed to be satisfied with pretending to be in love 
with some other girl forever like you?

I expected Yumi to get angry at that remark, but instead she was silent 
a moment, before answering, a little sadly:

--Yoshino, I don&#39;t know about you, but I wasn&#39;t pretending. Neither was 
Sachiko. Shall I tell you how I know that?

Toko, who was seated next to Yumi, turned towards her in surprise. 
Yoshino&#39;s eyes went wide in shock. She suddenly turned towards me where 
I sat, Noriko standing beside me, moving at Yoshino&#39;s gaze ever so 
slightly nearer.

--Oh my God. It&#39;s true. I&#39;m the only normal person in this room, aren&#39;t 
I?

--Oneesama?

Yoshino jumped at the sound, turning back to see Nana Arima, Rosa 
Foetida en bouton, just inside the door, arriving just in time for the 
meeting. Yumi quickly turned the photos over.

--How much of that did you hear? Yumi asked.

--Oneesama, is something wrong?

--No, no, nothing&#39;s wrong, said Yoshino. You know what? Today would be a 
great day for some Rosa Foetida quality time. Just you and me.

--But I thought we had a meeting right now...started Nana.

--Sure we do! Us two have a meeting! Let&#39;s go, &#39;kay?

Yoshino walked over to Nana and took her hand, turning back before she 
dragged Nana down the corridor to declare:

--Here&#39;s a headline for the paper! &quot;Yellow Rose Revolution! Final 
Battle!&quot;

C&#39;est l&#39;gros fun noir chez Joe Picard Une veill&eacute;e comme on en voit peu 
&Ccedil;a sonne a la porte, onze heures moins quart C&#39;est un &eacute;tranger, beau 
comme un dieu

--Wanna dance?

It was a man&#39;s voice in my ear. I turned to see who it was. A young man, 
about Sei&#39;s age, wearing a t-shirt saying MONTREAL. A tourist himself, 
presumably. By his expression he must have liked what he saw.

--Well...

--She&#39;s with me.

The man looked up behind me.

--What?

--I said she&#39;s with me.

I turned around to see Sei behind me, just in time to see her glaring 
dangerously at the man before looking down, grinning and grabbing my 
hand.

--I love this one. Come on, let&#39;s dance.

The DJ apparently had decided it was time for a change; he had been 
playing rock songs in English when we had arrived, much of it augmented 
by an electronic beat, but now he had put on a song in French that 
sounded like a rock version of a folk song. Before I knew what was 
happening Sei was dragging me onto the dance floor, leaving the young 
man alone on the couch, mouthing a curse under his breath before rising 
and walking towards the bar.

--I told you I can&#39;t dance, I said. It wasn&#39;t quite true, but I would 
have looked quite odd doing a traditional fan dance here.

--Neither can I.

I felt myself very clumsy at first, doing my best to copy Sei&#39;s 
gyrations, pumping her arms and shaking her hips, grinning devilishly, 
making as if she were having the time of her life. She must have been 
being modest; her dancing attracted a lot of attention, impressing women 
and men, some of whom she favoured with a brief dance, but never for 
long before returning her attention to me.

Being with Sei, though, brought me attention of my own. At one point a 
man stepped in front of me, dancing aggressively; being unsure what to 
do I was going to dance with him out of politeness, but Sei suddenly cut 
between us, dancing just as aggressively in front of him, her grin 
turning nasty, as if to say, You want her, do you? Well, you&#39;ll have to 
go through me.

Pis quand J&eacute;sus danse c&#39;est l&#39;bout de tout Il transpire m&ecirc;me de l&#39;eau 
b&eacute;nite De peur d&#39;en recevoir une goutte Le d&eacute;mon d&eacute;cide de prendre la 
fuite

The man quickly backed off. He could see Sei was determined to defend me 
from all comers.

At length I excused myself so I could go to the bathroom. I tried to ask 
her to come with me, but it was impossible to talk over the din; she 
guessed what I wanted, and mouthed, Go on. As I left the dance floor I 
turned back to look. Even the pretense of a smile had vanished, and now 
Sei&#39;s dancing became even more frenzied, as if she did not dare to stop, 
or could not stop, perhaps possessed.
--

--Crazy bitch!

The first thing I heard as we emerged from the club was a young woman 
screaming at another, who was just then running across rue Saint-Denis 
to a car, having apparently not brought a jacket.

I myself was glad to be back in the cool air of the street. Sei had 
stayed on the dance floor until they had closed, fuelled by Red Bulls 
and vodka. That, of course, meant I had had little chance to rest 
myself.

--Perhaps we should take the metro back? I suggested.

--Can&#39;t. It&#39;s...what? Three a.m.?...Metro shuts down at one...oops!

Sei stumbled near the top of the stairs, grabbing the banister just in 
time.

--Maybe we should get a taxi then...are you all right?

--I&#39;m fine! I&#39;m fine!...Just need some air...it&#39;s not that far 
anyway...I feel like a walk. Clear my head, you know?...Don&#39;t worry, 
I&#39;ve walked home in worse state than this. I remember where I live at 
least. Rue Sainte-Catherine pis rue Panet. I&#39;m good. Darn. Evening ends 
when I&#39;m just getting started...

I slipped an arm under hers as we started walking down rue Saint-Denis, 
holding her up as we slipped through the revelers as the bars and clubs 
disgorged, waiting for taxis, smoking cigarettes, shouting. At the 
corner of rue Saint Denis and boulevard de Maisonneuve, a young woman 
was crying hysterically, obviously drunk herself. She had a couple of 
male companions, talking to her calmly, obviously trying to console her, 
but she pushed them away, screaming what even I could tell was an 
obscenity.

I did not actually mind walking. I am used to walking in the countryside 
around Shoguji, and a walk is never as tiring when one has a companion. 
However, now Sei had stopped dancing, the energy had gone out of her. We 
had only just turned onto rue Sainte-Catherine when Sei said:

--Actually, Shimako? I need to sit down for a bit.

--You sure you&#39;re all right?

--&#39;Course I&#39;m all right! Our Lady&#39;s watching me!

Sei slipped out of my grasp and gestured dramatically upward.

We were standing in front of Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes. Above us 
was, indeed, a metal-plated statue of Our Lady, overlooking the street 
from the roof of the church, wearing the starry crown of the Queen of 
Heaven. I couldn&#39;t help but notice the plaque beside the church door as 
well:

VOUS QUI PASSEZ GENS DE HAUT SAVOIR OU GENS DE LA RUE GENS QUI 
CONTEMPLEZ DIEU OU GENS QUI L&#39;AVEZ OUBLI&Eacute; ENTREZ DANS CETTE MAISON DU 
P&Egrave;RE PROSTERNEZ-VOUS DEVANT LUI ADOREZ SON FILS INCARN&Eacute; ET RAPPELEZ-VOUS 
QUE LE MA&Icirc;TRE D&#39;&#140;UVRE C&#39;EST L&#39;ESPRIT DU P&Egrave;RE ET DU FILS

I said the last phrases aloud:

--Et avant de quitter, regardez tout simplement M&egrave;re Marie.

--Before you go, look upon Mother Mary. Yes kids, said Sei, sitting on 
the church steps, Our Lady is watching all her Son&#39;s children, those who 
contemplate God and those who&#39;ve forgotten him, even those who&#39;ve 
deliberately tried to forget him in the beautiful province of Queerbec. 
Nation of Queerbec. Whatever they&#39;re calling it these days. Go ahead, 
look, I&#39;ve seen her before. I just want to sit down.

I, however, had never seen Our Lady quite like this. She looked very 
different from the Virgin Mary I had known at Lillian, whose arms were 
clasped in prayer to her Son. The arms of Our Lady of Lourdes were 
outstretched as if to bless passers-by, or to invite them into her 
embrace.

Maria-sama no kokoro sore wa aozora watashitachi wo tsutsumu hiroi 
aozora

Sei, while I had been looking at Our Lady, had gone from sitting to 
almost lying across the steps, starting to sing herself drunkenly to 
sleep.

--Mmm...worse places to pass out I suppose, than under Our Lady&#39;s 
gaze...

--Sei, no! I said. You can&#39;t sleep there, come on!

It had been cloudy all evening, and as if to underscore my point, it 
began to drizzle at that precise moment.

--Ah shit, said Sei. Guess not. Help me up?

I offered her a hand and pulled her upright, and we continued to walk 
along the street towards the Village, trying not to pay any mind to the 
drizzle. As we crossed rue Berri Sei muttered:

--She watches, but she doesn&#39;t actually help you out much, eh?

--She doesn&#39;t just hand you things, I replied. That&#39;s not how it works.

--How does it work, then?

--Spare some change?

Outside the door of Archambault at the corner of rue Berri a beggar 
clearly took us for tourists, holding out his hand.

--On a pas d&#39;argent, said Sei in French, walking past, not looking at 
him.

--Crisse de bullshit! shouted the beggar. Vous-autres &ecirc;tes pleins! 
Pleins!

There were caf&eacute;s, bars and clubs on this side of rue Sainte-Catherine as 
well, the Studio and the Circus. They too had just closed, with 
revellers in various stages of inebriation emerging, couples and groups 
trying to shelter from the drizzle under awnings while waiting for a 
free taxi to arrive, the drizzle seeming to have drained their energy as 
much as was Sei&#39;s. Past them rue Sainte-Catherine grew less savoury; 
facing each other were a The&acirc;tre Olympia and a Video Adulte Wega. Was 
the Village the safest place for a woman on earth, as Sei had said? The 
glare of the street lights and the drizzle making the street look that 
much more forbidding. I pulled Sei a little closer to me.

Sei suddenly screamed, out of nowhere:

--OSCAR!

I jumped with fright, turning to Sei to see what she was talking about. 
She grinned back at me and pointed just ahead of us.

--Over there.

Sure enough, just beyond the adult DVD shop was a Banque Laurentienne, 
whose ATM was apparently dubbed OSCAR.

--Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist. You ever read that comic Rose of Versailles?

--No, I replied, a little curtly.

--About a girl in 18th century France whose father calls her Oscar and 
raises her as a boy. I read it in Japan, and then I come to Canada and I 
see Oscar all over Montreal. I find that pretty damn funny...

--Avez-vous de l&#39;argent pour quelque chose &agrave; manger?

I turned to look. A girl was sitting outside a restaurant called La 
Belle Province at the corner of rue Saint-Timoth&eacute;e, begging. She 
couldn&#39;t have been more than sixteen. She wore a thick coat with a hood 
that looked more appropriate for winter. Beside her was what was 
probably once a book-bag, now carrying her meager possessions. She had 
scrawled in cardboard a sign reading

N&#39;IMPORTE QUOI AIDE--MERCI

Sei looked at her for a long moment before finally asking her:

--Ah bon? Si tu veux que&#39;qu&#39;chose &agrave; manger, je l&#39;acheterai pour to&eacute; chez 
La Belle Province...

--J&#39;suis capable de l&#39;acheter mo&eacute;-m&ecirc;me...

--J&#39;donne pas de l&#39;argent aux gens dans la rue. Tu veux-tu que&#39;qu&#39;chose 
&agrave; manger, ou non?

--Oui...okay.

Then Sei turned to me and asked:

--Do you want something to eat?

--Not really. Do you?

--Nah. She wants something to eat. I figured what the heck. It won&#39;t 
take long. Mam&#39;zelle, she said to the girl, motioning her to follow us, 
suis-nous.

I couldn&#39;t find it in my heart to object. We found a table inside, and I 
offered to wait while Sei bought the food.

--Que c&#39;est que tu veux? Sei asked her.

--Hum...une poutine, s&#39;il vous pla&icirc;t, said the girl.

--Je te trouverai une grosse.

Sei went to get in line along with others in need of comfort food after 
a long night, and I sat across from the girl.

--Tu parles-tu fran&ccedil;ais, to&eacute; itou? she asked me.

Sei had been speaking to me in Japanese. I had to reply, &quot;Non;&quot; the girl 
looked unhappy at that answer, and fell silent. She did look hungry, 
tired, and unwashed. What had become of her that had forced her to beg 
on the streets of Montreal, while I spent my days in a garden of 
maidens, I was left to merely guess.

At length Sei came back with a Styrofoam bowl of what looked like French 
fries with melted cheese on top, which she put down before the girl 
before asking her:

--Alors, que c&#39;est qui t&#39;est arriv&eacute;?

The girl, in between wolfish bites of the poutine, animatedly told Sei 
her story, now and again indicating her leg. Perhaps it had been 
injured, but I could only guess, understanding next to nothing of what 
she was saying. I contented myself with watching Sei&#39;s expression as she 
listened, occasionally replying with big-sisterly advice, I presumed 
from her tone, as she so often had at Lillian. She seemed to be offering 
help, too, but the girl shook her head to refuse. At length, the girl 
finished eating and we left, Sei waving to her, saying:

--Garde-to&eacute; bien, hein?

--You know, Sei, you haven&#39;t changed all that much, I said.

--What you mean?

--You like taking care of people.

--Yeah, right, said Sei. I did as much for Goronta as I did for that 
girl just now. I&#39;m not taking too good a care of you, am I? Making you 
drag my ass home in the rain. Is Goronta still hanging around Lillian 
High?

It had in fact stopped drizzling just then; we quickly walked past a 
vacant lot and into the Village proper, passing a bookstore called 
Renaud-Bray across the street (&quot;My second home,&quot; said Sei--she still 
loved books too) before starting to enter the heart of the Village. The 
revelers from the gay clubs had started to move on, the sidewalks had 
thinned. Perhaps I was the one taking care of Sei, but I didn&#39;t mind. 
Having her there was enough to make me feel safer as we walked by clubs 
and shuttered shops with names at turns absurd and threatening: Sauna GI 
Joe, Priape, Aigle Noire.

--You didn&#39;t have to help her.

--Shouldn&#39;t I have? You used to complain when I&#39;d feed Goronta.

--No, it&#39;s all right...I just wondered why her...

--And not the guy at Archambault...? I told you, he&#39;s a pro. She looked 
like she actually needed food. Said she was from Amos--town way up 
north--ran off to Montreal, couldn&#39;t find a job, friends finally threw 
her out...Some guy tried to attack her the other night...hear it all the 
time. Isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve helped someone out. Tried to offer to 
buy her a bus ticket home. Station&#39;s not far from here. I&#39;ve done that 
too. But she was like, no way.

--What&#39;s so horrible in Amos she&#39;d rather sleep on the street in 
Montreal than go home?

--Damn if I know. She wouldn&#39;t tell me. I can guess, though. Felt bad.

Sei suddenly laughed, a little bitterly, adding:

--All right, you win. I thought she was cute.

--What? I said, looking up at her.

--What? You think if she&#39;d been an ugly old guy I&#39;d have been in such a 
hurry to help her? You know, I don&#39;t know how you and Yumi ran off with 
the idea I&#39;m a nice person.

It occurred to me the girl in fact had been quite pretty, or at any rate 
had been once and could be again with aid of little more than somewhere 
to bathe and decent food to eat. Sei Sato, heaven knew, knew a pretty 
girl when she saw one. But it had not been lust I had seen in Sei&#39;s 
expression. A sense of noblesse oblige, perhaps, that made her happy to 
help, or rather upset when she did not. A prince&#39;s need to save a damsel 
in distress. That&#39;s what upset her about me helping her home. The 
princess isn&#39;t supposed to save the prince.

--Horny lesbian with a bad attitude, that&#39;s me. I&#39;m not a nice person at 
all.

Sei&#39;s expression had turned suddenly dark again. She did not say it as 
if to fish for compliments. &quot;A lesbian with a bad attitude&quot;--that was 
her frank self-assessment. I could not simply say that she couldn&#39;t mean 
it, because she obviously did. I could not even tell her she was wrong, 
for it was not just the brighter side of Sei&#39;s personality that I had 
seen. I had seen that darker side in Noriko too; the mirror image of the 
tenderness and complete devotion to me, to the point that she seemed 
able to effortlessly forgive me for leaving her forever to run into the 
arms of another (as far as she knew), was her temper, even violence, 
against those she thought had slighted me.

But then, why the devotion? What did Sei see in me?

Just another damsel? No; she had not looked at the girl as she did me, 
or even Yumi. But Sei seemed to want to keep our relations just as 
superficial. Why go to such lengths to keep the ones she loved at arm&#39;s 
length? Crossing an ocean?

--You were always kind to me, I said at last.

--No I wasn&#39;t. What, you&#39;re going to tell me I was always there for you, 
or some crap like that? You wanted a soeur like that, you wanted Yoko. 
She was always there for me, whether I wanted her there or not, trying 
to be my friend and solve all my problems or some damn thing like that, 
like with Sachiko. I figured, who needs that bullshit? I left you alone. 
I liked you the way you were. Oneesama never tried to run my life 
either...

We walked past the SAQ du Village, under the rainbow flag and Quebec 
flag (the yuri flag, even I couldn&#39;t help but think of it as now). I 
noticed for the first time that someone had painted a cartoon character 
that looked like a hero from a science fiction animation on the mural.

It must have reminded Sei of Oscar, because she went on:

--Hell, even Lady Oscar wouldn&#39;t do that. There&#39;s a bit where Oscar&#39;s 
taking a coach through Paris, and this girl stops the coach and asks her 
to buy her for one night. Oscar just laughs and gives her a gold coin 
and tells her not to do that again...sorry, I&#39;m babbling...

--No, it&#39;s okay...

--Way too good to be true. Fact is, if the girl&#39;d have been ugly Oscar 
wouldn&#39;t have done that...that&#39;s what I thought when I read it.

--Oh yes?

--Thing was...I read it because, well...it was then I began to realize I 
wasn&#39;t quite right, so...I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s wrong with me. 
I heard about it from Rei Hasekura of all people. This great romantic 
classic. I asked could I borrow it, and she&#39;s like, yeah, okay, 
whatever. And I wind up laughing at it. Come on, this chick&#39;s too good 
to be true. Her dad&#39;s raising her to be a boy from day one, she&#39;s got to 
be twice as fucked up as me. And she&#39;s not even like me! The day before 
she dies at the Bastille she finally consummates her one true love. With 
the servant-boy she grew up with. Rosalie I could have handled, but 
Andr&eacute;? She&#39;d be like his brother or something...I learned only one 
useful thing from Lady Oscar.

--What was that?

--That romance novels suck, Sei snickered.

We had reached rue Panet, the Radio-Canada building before us like a 
homing beacon at the other end of the street, its logo looking to me now 
like a chrysanthemum.

--See, what did I tell you? We&#39;re almost home.

Sei gestured towards the Radio-Canada building, crying out mock-
dramatically:

--Encore...un peu...et la Bastille...va tomber...Continuez!

Obviously we must have walked past it before, but it was only now that I 
took a good look at the small park that had been built at the 
intersection, trees planted, benches erected and a memorial built, metal 
poles on which had been tied ribbons of every colour, a metal plaque 
telling all who passed in whose memory it had been erected:

&Agrave; LA M&Eacute;MOIRE DES PERSONNES MORTES DU SIDA AU QU&Eacute;BEC

--Oh shit, said Sei suddenly. Shimako, I don&#39;t feel so good.

Sei ran to a trash-can in the park and began to retch.

I approached her from behind and slowly rubbed her back, fixing my eye 
on the wall in front of us on which somebody had scrawled

VIVE LE QU&Eacute;BEC LIBRE

The house was in darkness. Madeleine clearly had long since gone to bed. 
It took several moments of fumbling before Sei was able to get her house 
key in the door. I helped her out of her wet jacket once we were inside.

--Lie down for me, I told her, once we got to the living room. Where are 
your water glasses?

--I don&#39;t want water, she said. I&#39;m not dying. I do this all the time.

--Drink until you throw up?

--Well, I haven&#39;t actually puked in a while...

--Where are your glasses? I said, helping Sei onto the couch.

--Over the sink.

So Sei lay down on the couch, and I went into the kitchen to find a 
water glass and filled it from the tap. I offered it to Sei, who 
accepted it, making room on the couch so as to invite me to sit with 
her.

--Thanks, Shimako, said Sei. You&#39;re a sweetheart.

Sei quickly drained it, and I took it from her and put it on one of the 
arms of the couch before sitting down.

--God, I&#39;m a pretty crappy host, eh? she said.

--Don&#39;t be silly. I had a very nice time.

--It&#39;s just...I was supposed to be taking care of you tonight, and 
you&#39;re the one winding up taking care of me...

In the glare of the street lights Sei&#39;s drawn, exhausted face had seemed 
harsh, twisted even. Now, in the half-light from the kitchen is seemed 
softer, her beauty ephemeral, like an exotic flower uprooted from the 
earth and put in a pot somewhere by a thoughtless human, left to die of 
neglect.

--Don&#39;t worry about it, really, I said, taking her hand to sooth her.

--Shimako?

--Yes, Sei?

--You still haven&#39;t told me. What do you want to do with your life?

I had not been prepared for that question. I hesitated long enough that 
Sei finally added:

--That you got to come here to do it, I mean. You still haven&#39;t told me 
that. I still don&#39;t understand...I mean...I was the one who didn&#39;t fit 
in. I don&#39;t even fit in here. You want to know why I liked you? You 
actually seemed sort of normal. Happy, even.

--What did you think I was going to do?

--What, the truth? I always thought you&#39;d make someone an excellent 
wife.

--A wife?

--Yeah...living some place with a nice guy...taking care of a house with 
a beautiful flower garden...lots and lots of kids...you know, normal 
happily-ever-after stuff. Stuff that normal girls do when they grow up. 
Maybe it&#39;s just &#39;cause I&#39;m never likely to do any of that. I dunno...I 
just thought you&#39;d be good at that. Better than I&#39;d ever be.

Sei reached up to brush a stray hair out of my eyes, very furtively, as 
if barely daring, to do anything more.

--You&#39;re gentle...You&#39;re kind...you&#39;re drop-dead gorgeous.
--Sei, that&#39;s the alcohol talking. You don&#39;t mean that.

--No really! You ever look at yourself in the mirror? What straight guy 
wouldn&#39;t want you? He&#39;d be the luckiest man on earth...Relax, okay?...I 
know you&#39;re not like me. I don&#39;t want you to be like me. It&#39;s really 
overrated. You&#39;re okay the way you are, Shimako. You&#39;re okay.

The light in Sei&#39;s eyes that I had seen on the train had returned to her 
eyes, more brightly than before, for all that not burning but peaceful, 
warm and still. I had never seen her so at peace, so still, as now, 
smiling at me and looking up at me into my eyes. Just having me here 
seemed to comfort her. As for me, sitting by her, being quiet and 
gentle, as we had so rarely had the chance to do, brought out a 
contentment and stillness in me I had never felt before.

A calm.

--Though...

Sei shut her eyes, chuckling quietly to herself.

--Yes? I said.

--You don&#39;t have to go yet, if you don&#39;t want...

I did not want to leave. I sat with her a few minutes more, waiting 
until I was sure she was asleep, before I let go of Sei&#39;s hand and 
brought the glass into the kitchen to wash it, turning out the light 
behind me as I went to the bathroom to wash.

In bed the first thing I did was to say a decade of the Rosary, but it 
did no good. All I could think of was the sight of that beautiful face 
as she fell asleep. When I am in such a mood there are only a few ways I 
know of put such thoughts out of my mind so I can sleep. Only one is 
completely effective.

I imagined I was back in the Rose Mansion after my date with Shizuka, my 
head in Sei&#39;s lap as she soothed me. She offered to give me a kiss 
herself, or whatever else I pleased. Another of her teases.

In my daydreams, at least, I had no fear. I did not hesitate for a 
moment, rising to meet her gaze, looking deeply into her eyes and 
kissing her, embracing her tightly, letting myself go completely, as I 
had done with Noriko, as I had always longed to do with Sei.</pre>
