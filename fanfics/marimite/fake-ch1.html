<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I hate sticking  Japanese in my fictions, but once again, I find it unavoidable, so  here are your translations:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Onee-sama: </em> Big  sister.  Used by <em>petite soeurs </em>at Lillian to address their <em>grande soeurs. </em>Very formal.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  tired / sleeping through the day / bloodshot eyes and / the sweat  from my body / and I picked my head up yesterday / found no reason or  hope left inside of me.</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But I  still believe in immortal love / and I know there’s someone who’s  up above / and shine down / just give me a chance to feel it</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>--</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shine down</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bulk  of the next day passed largely without incident, and although Sachiko  was so overflowing with excitement that she came very close to  walking quickly when the phone rang around seven in the evening,  overall she did not act much differently than she usually did. In any  case, neither the butlers nor Suguru noticed any change in  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The phone was answered by the phone servant before she  could possibly have reached it, even at an unthinkably fast mild  trot. She managed to slow down before anybody noticed, and it  turned out that the phone wasn’t for her anyway.  It was for her  mother, who was out for the week.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  minutes later, Sachiko retreated to the patio, finding Suguru  strangely absent; typically, they spent this part of the evening  here.  Had he, perhaps, gone out for the evening? Sachiko wondered  briefly how he had managed to sneak past the servants who doubled as  door guards, before finally concluding that he probably hadn’t gone  out so much as locked himself in one of the house’s many rooms.  He  did that sometimes; he did it more when the house was as it was now,  empty save for the servants and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>is he  hiding from </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  shook her head, trying to remind herself of how unconcerned she was.  He  wasn’t here, and that was the important thing. She was  unthreatened.  She could do what<em> she </em>wanted to do, in the kind  of peace and quiet that she privately believed every sane human  should seek; the perfect, dead silence of the night.  That, in fact,  had been why her family had chosen to build their manor so far away  from the main road; it was near-impossible to hear even the noisiest  of cars passing by the front gate from where Sachiko was now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  moment’s consideration, Sachiko stood and switched the patio light  off, bathing her in nearly perfect darkness. As she settled back into  her chair, she felt the silence overwhelm her even further, and not  unpleasantly—she felt her muscles relax, felt her mind untwist  itself; as though the disruption of the patio’s protective light  had allowed the night’s tranquility to extend just that much  further into Sachiko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later, however, the night erupted into noise; a simple, electronic  tone filled the air with its rigid, flat impression of Beethoven’s  8th Symphony, and it took Sachiko a moment to realize that  it was coming from the pocket of her nightgown. She quickly reached  in, wondering why in the world she had placed her cellular phone in  her nightgown for a moment before remembering that it was because she  had been waiting for Yumi to call.  She flipped it open and glanced  momentarily at the Caller-ID.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Youko  Mizuno, </em>it said; if she felt any immediate discontent, she forced  it to the bottom of her throat as she accepted the call and placed  the phone gently to her ear, brushing her hair out of the way with  her unused hand.  “Yes,” she said, <em>Ogasawara residence…no. </em>“Sachiko Ogasawara speaking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sachiko?”  Youko’s voice was as flat and subtly interested as it had always  been.  “This is Youko Mizuno.” <em>Ladyship for the new age: Even  though they can read your name as plain as day off of their screen;  even if they knew exactly who they were calling as they dialed, you  must always introduce yourself as though you were meeting them for  the first time in many years. </em>“It’s been a while.” <em>Youko  doesn’t ask how people are doing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  has. I hope you’re well?” <em>Even if you are as close as the  petals on a rose, you will still speak to your</em> onee-sama <em>as  though she were a priest. Even if it is your first meeting in years,  you will not become overexcited. You will speak as calm and  evenly  as a lady always should. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am.  My summer classes have just let out, and I’m quite enjoying my  newfound freedom, though my fall classes will start soon.” <em>That’s  right. Youko is considering medical school, so she’s taking a lot  of classes right now. She’s—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>—even  if you come upon your best friend, intimate with the man you love,  you will not allow jealousy to touch your lips—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what about you?” Oddly enough, Youko’s voice seemed, to the  well-trained ear, almost slightly miffed. “Have you made plans to  attend a university?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  was strangely grateful to her old friend and <em>grande soeur </em>for  asking the question. “Yes, I have,” she said. “I’m planning  on attending the University of Kyoto in the spring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Youko sounded genuinely interested.  “To study what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  like to study literature.  And after that…” Sachiko hesitated,  toying briefly with the idea of confessing to her <em>grande soeur </em>that she wanted to learn to write. Not that it wasn’t a  desirable profession for a lady; only that it wasn’t a desirable  profession for <em>her. </em>For Sachiko Ogasawara, heir to the  Ogasawara Group and all of its fortune and wealth, trophy wife, and  future recipient of the vaunted <em>quiet life. </em>Youko knew better  than anybody that Sachiko wanted a <em>quiet life,</em> but not quite <em>that </em>quiet of a life.  Youko knew better than anybody that  Sachiko was not a trophy wife.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She knew  it better, perhaps, than even Sachiko herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  did you want to do after that?” Youko gently prompted, but did not  demand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still,  Sachiko hesitated.  This felt to Sachiko strangely like she had felt  when she had first realized that Suguru wasn’t interested in her  not because he was interested in another woman, but because he was  interested in another <em>man. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  also feels strangely like…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  like to pursue my Master’s in Japanese Language with an emphasis on  creative writing. I think I’d like to write for a living.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s  not even remotely true, </em>Sachiko thought as soon as she said it.  The truth was, Sachiko had no idea what she wanted to do for a  living; it was almost universally common in university pre-first  years; very few of them ever really had a grasp on exactly what it  was they wanted to do or be.  Sachiko only knew what she’d be <em>allowed </em>to do, and she knew that out of all of those things,  writing seemed the most enjoyable. <em>To write your own definitions. </em>She had previously tried her hand at it once or twice, and while  the quality of her work had been praised by Suguru, who had</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>been  in my room</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">found  it laying around, thanks to a careless mistake by Sachiko, the  experience had been so emotionally and mentally exhausting, and she  was still not sure that she wanted to have to do something like that  for the rest of her life. She only knew that she <em>could, </em>which  had tipped the scales in her decision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,”  Youko said without the slightest hint of enthusiasm; a clear sign of  disbelief if ever there was one. “That’s wonderful. I must say,  though, that I’m rather surprised that you were able to decide this  all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  of a sudden?” <em>Can a question be a lie?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Youko said. “It’s just that I seem to recall quite clearly how  gracefully you managed to avoid the question every time somebody  asked you about your plans for the future. What was it that you used  to say?” She paused for a moment, and Sachiko sighed, waited for  her to say it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  really not sure where precisely I want to direct my life at this  point, although I plan on going to the University of Kyoto, and I’m  certain that I’ll decide soon, thank you for asking.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sa-chan?”  To say that Suguru’s voice, coming from behind Sachiko, startled  her would be an understatement. At his words, her eyes flew fully  open, and her mind immediately reeled, unable to focus and tell her, <em>it’s just Suguru, calm down </em>as her free hand clenched itself  into a fist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  Youko’s voice that undid the temporary knot of panic that formed in  her head. “Oh my,” she said, “is that Kashiwagi I hear? What  would he be doing there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  lives here now,” Sachiko said quickly. “Please hold on for a  moment.” She allowed herself to relax, and then covered the  mouthpiece on the cellular phone as best she could, turned to Suguru,  and said, “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi  Fukuzawa is on the phone for you,” he said with a small grin that  was contradicted utterly by the small look of concern in his eyes.  “Who is on the phone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Youko  Mizuno. Could you ask Yumi to hold for a moment? I’ll take the  phone shortly.” <em>Why did he come out to tell me himself? Did he  kill the phone-servant? </em>She mused, a bit humored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” he said, and then exited with a grace befitting of a lady’s  stature.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  thought probably caused the mild note of amusement in Sachiko’s  voice when she said, “Pardon me, Youko, but I have a call from Yumi  on the other phone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Youko  seemed disinterested in this, but rather focused on Sachiko’s  voice. “You sound amused,” she pointed out. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  Sachiko desperately wanted to tell Youko about her seemingly running  joke about Suguru.  She wanted Youko to laugh about it with her, and  tell her…tell her <em>something </em>about something related yet  inconsequential that would make Sachiko want to laugh as well.  Sachiko would, of course, hold her own laugh in, but she would feel  it nonetheless, building at the back of her throat, tickling her  lungs pleasantly, but more important than that, comfortingly.  Youko  had an unacknowledged ability to turn a conversation in virtually  whatever direction she wanted it to go in, and to provoke nearly  whatever reaction she desired from her audience. It helped, of  course, that she was an excellent public speaker.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">None of  this happened, of course.  Rather, Sachiko said, quietly, “Nothing.  It’s nothing.  I simply felt the urge to cough; excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course.” It seemed as though statements which asserted nothing, yet  were lies nonetheless were becoming increasingly common. “I suppose  you shouldn’t keep your <em>petite soeur </em>waiting for too long,  should you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  about the way that Youko said <em>petite soeur </em>made Sachiko  uncomfortable, but she couldn’t put her finger on <em>what</em>,  precisely. “No, I shouldn’t. I’m very sorry to cut you short.” <em>When an apology is as common as punctuation, as routine as  formalities, does that make it any less sincere? Was it sincere in  the first place? </em>Sachiko felt that this would be a question that  would haunt her for a long, long time to come, and therefore resolved  not to think on it any longer; at least, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  at all,” Youko said. “I will call back again sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  look forward to it.” <em>That, </em>at least, wasn’t a lie.  As  little as they had done it during her time at school, speaking with  her <em>grande soeur </em>was something Sachiko genuinely enjoyed. It  was like talking with …with a close sibling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like  talking with a big sister.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  that Sachiko would know anything about that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A click,  and Youko was gone. A moment later, the phone servant, alive and  apparently unhurt (though Sachiko still felt a small niggle in the  back of her head tell her to check his wrists for cuff marks  ) was  behind her with a cordless phone in his hand, the mouthpiece covered.   Sachiko nodded her thanks and put the receiver to her ear with a  small burst of excitement that she mercilessly squashed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yumi?”  she said.  “I’m sorry to have made you wait.” <em>When an  apology is as routine as formality…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  can still be sincere. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  no problem,” Yumi said cheerfully.  She was, by Sachiko’s  observation, completely unfazed by her wait, something Sachiko could  only marvel at. “I’m sorry to have called so late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not that late,” Sachiko said a bit too quickly. Yumi said nothing  about the slip. “What was it that you called about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wanted to confirm our plans for the picnic tomorrow; is one in the  afternoon still okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Sachiko said gently. She desperately wanted to add, <em>it’s  not like I’m doing anything else, </em>but couldn’t, left rather  to hope against hope that Yumi would pick up on it without any sort  of hinting from her. In short, she was praying for a sudden wave of  ESP to strike her <em>petite soeur.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  it did. “Are you alright, <em>onee-sama?</em>” Yumi’s concern was  genuine, and because of that it was astoundingly refreshing. Yumi was  typically refreshing in that way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  being refreshing becomes as common as punctuation…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  question that needed no answer.  Sachiko couldn’t help but grin a  little.  “Of course I am, Yumi. Of course I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad.” And she very obviously was.  “So, tomorrow at one, is that  alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  that’s exactly it.  Will you have any trouble with that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“None.   It’s settled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  of silence formed between them, and the niggle started working at the  back of Sachiko’s head again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Say  it, </em>it said. <em>Say it to her this time.  You said something  like it once before. Say it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sachiko  didn’t argue, but she didn’t obey either.  It was harder than it  seemed, and she had no idea where Suguru was, and even though <em>saying  it </em>wouldn’t present any sort of news to him, she was still  loathe to admit <em>anything </em>around the man, much less something  important.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  still act like Suguru is your enemy. He’s not. None of this is his  fault.  He’s as trapped and helpless as you are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  even so…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Say  it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  couldn’t. She knew it. Not on the phone. Not in her home.  She  couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  would have to make do.  “I’m very glad that you called, Yumi,”  she said.  “And I’m glad that you invited me, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry I couldn’t call sooner.” This could have meant many things,  but Sachiko was content to assume it meant all of them.  “I missed  you, Sa--<em>onee-sama</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  beginning to slip like that more frequently, and it made Sachiko  secretly happy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Very </em>secretly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  are you going tomorrow?” Suguru’s voice cut Sachiko like a length  of piano wire.  Sachiko had overcome the urge to be defensive long  ago; more than a decade ago, in fact, so she was able to take this  with the kind of grace and calm that had won her the admiration of a  good portion of her old classmates.  “I didn’t hear anything  about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  surprised you heard about it at all,” Sachiko said evenly,  “considering that I hadn’t told you anything of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suguru  shrugged. “That’s why I’m asking where you’re going; because  you didn’t tell me anything about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  down to the river off the edge of our property. My <em>petite soeur </em>and I are going to have a picnic there, and then have tea with an  old friend.  Is that a problem?” Loosely translated:  Do you think  you can justify having a problem with that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  at all.  I’m simply surprised that you hid this from me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  apologize for not informing you sooner, but I had no intent of hiding  anything from you. I’m sorry.” <em>When apologies are as routine  as formalities…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Suguru said, with a note of spite in his voice that  Sachiko didn’t understand in the least.  “Enjoy yourself  tomorrow.”  And then he was gone, leaving Sachiko fairly well  baffled.  She had never seen him act like that before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> You  did once.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We’re  not thinking about that, though.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately,  Sachiko spent a large portion of the rest of the night thinking about  that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  worst part was, of course, that she could barely gather from the  scattered fragments in her brain what <em>that </em>was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or cuts  from piano wire –Takashi Miike speaking through this author.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/Notes:  Something I’m beginning to realize as I write this is how easy it  is to fall into the trap that formality and politeness presents  within conversation; it’s very easy to find something to say when  you were brought up like Sachiko was, and yet at the same time, when  you find this to say, you’re saying nothing at all. It’s a burden  and a bane, to smack you with the old cliché.</span></p>
