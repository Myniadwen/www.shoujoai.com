<p align="center">Author’s notes:</p>
<p align="center">This is the final chapter of Fake. It’s going to be very long.</p>
<p align="center">Before  you say anything, while it is true that some Japanese universities are  difficult, in general, the Japanese university experience is fairly  easy and laid-back, rather than difficult and competitive like most  western universities. (Japanese high schools tend to give students  their fill of difficult and competitive.)</p>
<p align="center">Bonus points if you can catch where I swiped my definition of a good author from.</p>
<p align="center">I  have taken liberties with the entire Japanese language in this chapter.  Small ones, but if they offend you, please feel free to tell me about  it.</p>
<p align="center">Japanese families are traditionally expected to put their children through university.</p>
<p align="center">I know it’s been a long road and even a long time since an update, but I finally got it done.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p align="center"><em>This  place has begun to cover me; I recall the light but the dark smothers  me / I prefer the feelings I know right now / I don’t worry about  feeling very proud.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Because here I know how it feels to be misunderstood / to reach for the sky, I thought you never would</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Cause there’s not much more that I can fake. </em></p>

<p>Madness.  There were other words for it, but Sei knew the best one. It was  madness. One hundred and ten percent homegrown grade-A madness with a  side of bullshit. This was stupid. Worse, it was unbelievable. If  somebody made it into a movie you couldn’t <em>pay </em>her to see it.</p>
<p><em>Who even </em>does <em>that? Is that some kind of power trip? We were coming back in </em>two goddamn days<em> and he couldn’t wait that long, so he gets in his imposing black car  with a pair of men in imposing black suits and comes and finds us in  Kyoto, fuckall if I know how. Did he stick Sachiko with a homing  device? Was that it? It plays like a really, really, really bad spy  movie and it stinks just as bad. </em></p>
<p><em>And then, what? He just  says, “Okay, vacation’s over. See you later,” and for some utterly  unperceivable reason, instead of kicking him in the nuts and telling  him to go fuck himself, she just </em>gets into the car and leaves. <em>I was getting ready to stick Yumi with a tranquilizer dart to calm her down. How the fuck could she even explain that? </em>Yeah,  sorry about that, babe. I was going to have a great time with you at a  live house, get piss-drunk, and then probably do things to slash with  you that I couldn’t tell the nuns about, but I decided at the last  minute that I was going to get into a car with my fiancé, whom I hate,  instead.</p>
<p>It was just stupid. Madness.</p>
<p>And it pissed Sei right the fuck off.</p>
<p>She  knew she shouldn’t fixate on it. It was none of her damn business if  Sachiko said it was none of her damn business, and by getting  wordlessly into a car with that son of a bitch Suguru, she had  essentially done just that. If she wanted to fuck up her own life, she  could fuck up her own life.</p>
<p><em>(Not many people would call marrying a handsome man and living in wealth and comfort for the rest of your life </em>fucking up<em>.)</em></p>
<p>But  she could not help it. Remember? This was one of the cases they should  get involved. They were going to bust shit up, tell her what’s what.  Kick ass.</p>
<p>And none of it happened.</p>
<p>In the end they were all just motherfucking bluster and smoke.</p>
<p>Sei’s fist hit the wall before she realized what she was doing, and it hurt. “Son of a <em>bitch</em>,” she hissed, more in anger than in pain.</p>
<p><em>Wouldn’t you have wanted somebody to interfere with </em>(her)?<em> To have just stood </em>(her)<em> there and told </em>(her)<em>, </em>why  in the fucking hell would you want to become a nun? You have a damn  good life ahead of you, and people who love you. Why throw that all  away just so you can die a virgin?</p>
<p>Sei supposed she would probably be told that she <em>just didn’t understand.</em> That there was something more to becoming a nun, something that made it  perfectly reasonable for teenage girls whose hormones ought to have  been beating down their hem-hem doors to dream not of being swept away  by some good looking man (or woman) but of taking a vow of chastity for  the sake of an omniscient deity who probably didn’t give a fuck one way  or another who popped whose cherry.</p>
<p><em>Something that makes girls  who are in love give it up. Give up love for God’s sake. Because God  commands it. Because He wants all your love. Because He is  all-powerful, infinitely wise and merciful, and He is also incredibly  insecure. </em></p>
<p><em>It makes sense in some way, then, that man was made in God’s image.</em></p>
<p>And  that, really, was the problem Sei had always had with God, but more  than that, with His self-appointed church: Even though it preached  love—and it really, really did; one could not attend a Catholic  institution without reading the bible extensively—it demanded that one  give it up. <em>And for what? Because loving God is all you should  need? You don’t need to love another man—or another woman? Then why  bother getting married? Why not just fuck once in your life to  procreate—or shit, just skip that step entirely and find a clean turkey  baster—and then raise the kid to love Him as much as you love Him? Why  even love your child if God’s love is all you need? </em></p>
<p><em>Why abandon people who love you? Just because God does?</em></p>
<p><em>And isn’t that the core of it all? </em></p>
<p><em>Isn’t it really just that </em>(she) <em>made  a bad decision, thinking not of herself, nor of others, but of the big  man in the sky who supposedly asks us to love only him? </em></p>
<p><em>Isn’t  that why this pisses you off so bad? Sachiko is doing the same thing.  She’s making a decision not for herself, nor for those whom she cares  about, but for some people who she shouldn’t care about, since they  certainly don’t give a flying fuck about her.</em></p>
<p><em>Why do I blame</em> her <em>for that? </em></p>
<p><em>Why do I blame </em>myself <em>for that? </em></p>
<p><em>How can I blame anybody?</em></p>
<p>Sei felt like crying.</p>
<p>She really did blame herself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her business. It wasn’t her problem. It wasn’t her life.</p>
<p>But  she couldn’t help but feel like maybe it was her business. Maybe it was  her problem. Maybe because she loved Sachiko—and she did, in the same  way she loved</p>
<p><em>(she stares at me and I stare back, stark naked)</em></p>
<p><em>(what the fuck was that)</em></p>
<p>Rei—or maybe just because she was just on a vendetta. Maybe she felt like she needed some form of forgiveness for letting <em>(her) </em>make a mistake.</p>
<p>Maybe she was just trying to prove to herself that<em> (she) </em>had, in fact, made a mistake. Maybe then she could justify her anger. Because on some level, she knew she couldn’t. <em>(She) </em>had  done exactly what she wanted to do with her life, and that was what  everybody had to do, inevitably. Even if it was stupid or silly or  foolish or just motherfucking painful.</p>
<p><em>But the cases…they’re different.</em></p>
<p><em>Sachiko isn’t doing what she wants with her life.</em></p>
<p><em>Is that the truth, though? Or is that just what you want to be true?</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe Sachiko has the same thing that </em>(she)<em> has. Some strange sense of duty that you could never, ever understand. Maybe there’s just something that</em> you’re <em>missing. </em></p>
<p><em>Maybe the world isn’t wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe </em>you’re</p>
<p>Something  vibrated near her crotch. She jerked, torn from her over-reflective  reverie, and dug into her pocket reflexively, grasping onto her phone,  which vibrated in her hand as she pulled it out. Without looking at who  was calling, she flipped it open with a “Hello?” which was more than a  little annoyed.</p>
<p>“<em>Onee-sama?</em>” The voice on the other end was gentle but timid, a nice girl unused to getting snapped at. Her <em>petite soeur </em>was just such a nice girl.</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m sorry.” She shook her head. <em>Idiot. Calm the fuck down or you’ll wind up pissing more people off. </em>“What is it, Shimako?”</p>
<p>“I…was wondering if you could let me into your room,” Shimako said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“You…what?” Sei blinked. <em>I dropped her off less than two hours ago. How would she even get down here? Topping that, why would she bother? </em>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Shimako said. “I tried knocking on your door and ringing your doorbell, but you didn’t answer.”</p>
<p><em>She did?</em></p>
<p>She  stood quickly, hurrying over to the door of her small house. She  unlocked and opened the door, and found Shimako standing there, her  phone still held to her ear in one hand, a small plastic grocery bag in  the other.</p>
<p>They stared at one another for a moment, and then hung up. Sei had to work hard not to say <em>goodbye </em>as she did.</p>
<p>“What is it, Shimako?” Sei asked, and then immediately wished she’d phrased it better.</p>
<p>Shimako did not falter this time. “I thought we might have dinner together tonight, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“I…kind of don’t have much to cook for two.” Sei had more or less just been planning to have ramen.</p>
<p>Shimako held up her bag and smiled gently. “I figured as much. May I come in?”</p>
<p>Sei nodded a bit dumbly.</p>
<p>Shimako  entered. “Are you hungry now, or should I wait?” she asked, as if  utterly dismissing the fact that she had essentially invited herself  over to Sei’s house completely on a whim, something which was as  un-Shimako-like as just about anything Sei could think of.</p>
<p>“I’m…we can eat now.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Shimako said. “I’ve brought fresh tofu, and I wouldn’t want it getting soggy.”</p>
<p><em>She really </em>did <em>plan this out. </em></p>
<p><em>What’s her game?</em></p>
<p>Sei wished she didn’t have to wonder that.</p>
<p>She wondered if she would ever stop.</p>
<p>From  her bag, she produced a small plastic container full of some sort of  liquid, and what was essentially a hunk of tofu. It looked unbearably  delicious; fresh rather than preprocessed. Something you got from a  local store rather than a supermarket or a convenience store. “Do you  have a frying pan?” Shimako asked. “Or, better yet, a wok?”</p>
<p>“I  have a wok,” Sei said, and immediately wished she hadn’t—she remembered  just as she did that she’d left it to soak while she’d been gone. It  was probably unbelievably rank at this point.</p>
<p><em>Sei, what in the hell is wrong with you?</em></p>
<p>What <em>was </em>wrong  with her? She was not a messy person by nature—or if she was, she was  not a messy person by practice. Lillian had beaten it out of her.</p>
<p><em>How have you been living these past few months?</em></p>
<p>It had not been good.</p>
<p>She could barely even remember it.</p>
<p>“<em>Onee-sama</em>…how  long has this been soaking?” came Shimako’s voice from her kitchen. She  sounded almost nervous, and Sei could not blame her. She, too, would be  nervous about tentacles maybe coming from that water, grabbing her by  the wrist, and dragging her down an unnecessarily wide drainage pipe.</p>
<p><em>Son of a bitch. </em></p>
<p>“You maybe … don’t want to touch that.”</p>
<p>“I need to use it, though. I’ll be okay.”</p>
<p><em>I’m not so sure about that.</em></p>
<p><em>What the hell is wrong with you, Sei? You’re not a messy person. How did you let that happen?</em></p>
<p><em>I had just kind of … kept putting it off. I hadn’t really felt like cleaning. </em></p>
<p><em>Before Sachiko invited you over, when was the last time you actually got out? </em></p>
<p>She  could not for the life of her remember. She had to have gotten out at  some point. She was typically a marginally sociable person. Certainly  she was one of those that needed social contact to function properly.  Maybe that was why the time after <em>(she) </em>had left, but before  she had met the Rose Council, had been so hellish for her. So  difficult. Certainly it wasn’t painful anymore, but it wasn’t something  she enjoyed thinking back on.</p>
<p><em>Then why had you been wallowing in it for so long?</em></p>
<p>Was that what she’d been doing?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it is. </em></p>
<p><em>That’s  what you did instead of washing the damn dishes. You let them wallow,  and then you laid in your bed and wallowed yourself. </em></p>
<p>How  long had she spent simply laying there, watching television? Feeling  like she was wasting away, occasionally drifting into sleep. Never  sleeping a full night.</p>
<p>She could not remember.</p>
<p>She heard  dishes clattering in the kitchen, and cursed again, stood up, and went  quickly into the kitchen, to find Shimako drawing new water for her  dishes to soak in. The smell was not pleasant but it was getting better.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it, Shimako.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but I’ll take care of it, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve got it. It’s my mess. You don’t need to get some sort of damn infection off of my grime.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be just fine.”</p>
<p>“Seriously. Thank you for coming over with food, but I can take care of this.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite welcome, but please, allow me to handle it.”</p>
<p>“Shimako. Seriously. Please.”</p>
<p>Shimako gave her a look as hard as steel. “<em>Onee-sama</em>, please go sit down.”</p>
<p>It was about as close to snapping as Shimako had ever gotten, and Sei was actually taken aback. “What’s…” she stopped. <em>Don’t start anything. That’s the last thing you need, you stupid shit. </em>“You know what, forget it. Fine.” <em>That was not how to not start anything. What the hell is the matter with you? </em>“I’ll wait in the other room.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Shimako said, and Sei retreated, finding herself physically shaking from the confrontation.</p>
<p>When she was back in the living room, she collapsed into a heap on the floor.</p>
<p><em>God. Damn it.</em></p>
<p>What was wrong with her?</p>
<p>She  thought about it as Shimako cleaned, and then cooked, and then cleaned  again. All in all, in the better part of the hour Shimako was in the  kitchen, she came up with precisely nothing. More often than not she  just wound up circling around the same point: <em>I just haven’t felt like doing much lately.</em></p>
<p>Shimako  eventually came back carrying two large, steaming bowls which smelled  absolutely heavenly. She had no idea what was in them, and didn’t much  care at this point. As she smelled them, her stomach growled.</p>
<p><em>It’s been a while since I ate.</em></p>
<p>She hadn’t been planning on eating ramen.</p>
<p>She hadn’t been planning on eating at all.</p>
<p>What  was wrong with her? It wasn’t as though she was planning to starve  herself. She had simply made no plans to eat. She didn’t even have any  ramen.</p>
<p>Shimako set the bowl down in front of her, and then sat  down across the table, set her own bowl down. Each bowl, Sei found,  already had a wide spoon in it. They clapped their hands together, said  a brief thanks for the food, and then began to eat.</p>
<p>The flavor of  the soup was absolutely astounding, and the tofu inside was delicious,  neither too rubbery nor too mushy. Before Sei was quite aware of what  she was doing, her bowl was empty.</p>
<p>Her stomach growled again.</p>
<p>Shimako said, “There’s more in the kitchen,” shortly.</p>
<p><em>Is she pissed at me?</em></p>
<p><em>She ought to be.</em></p>
<p>Sei went through the cycle of <em>refill-demolish </em>twice  more before she felt more or less sated. Shimako, during this time went  through only one bowl. When she finished, they set their spoons down,  said a quick thanks for the food (again), and then lapsed into silence.  Shimako began to gather up the dishes after a minute, and Sei made to  stop her, but as she did, she got another tough look from Shimako.</p>
<p>She slumped back.</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with </em>her?</p>
<p>Another ten minutes and Shimako reemerged from the kitchen holding two small prepackaged ice cream cups.</p>
<p>“Dessert,” she said, her voice a bit gentler, less edgy.</p>
<p>Sei nodded, sat up straight, and they went through the same routine they had before—Sei demolished hers, Shimako savored hers.</p>
<p>When they had finished, as before, they lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Sei  took the opportunity to gather up the cups and throw them away. She  found Shimako had taken out her trash for her while she’d been cleaning.</p>
<p><em>God damn it, you’re not my mother. What are you doing?</em></p>
<p>It  irritated her a little. Was Shimako implying that Sei could not take  care of herself? Was she implying that she was simply too messy? What <em>was </em>she saying?</p>
<p><em>Maybe  she was just saying that the trash was getting full. Maybe she’s saying  that it’s burnable trash day. You ever think of that? </em></p>
<p><em>What is wrong with you?</em></p>
<p>She went back into the small living room and sat down next to Shimako.</p>
<p>“You have been worrying again, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>Sei felt like she should wear a tin hat.</p>
<p>“I have not.”</p>
<p>“You are a poor liar.”</p>
<p>“I’m  really not lying. I haven’t really been thinking about anything at  all.” Not a lie, given the proper timeframe. “It’s just been a rough  few months is all, with classes and all.”</p>
<p>“You are a very smart person, <em>Onee-sama</em>. I have a hard time believing classes would trouble you that much.”</p>
<p>“What much? I’m <em>fine</em>.”</p>
<p>“You  are not.” It had been over a year since Sei had heard that sort of  outright defiance from Shimako. It was both refreshing and a bit  troubling. Mostly troubling. “Please. Stop lying.”</p>
<p>Sei leaned  back and sighed. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting out of me,  Shimako. If you think that you’ll push hard enough and eventually I’ll  just break down and start sobbing about how miserable I am, you’re  going to be disappointed, because I’m not. I really am all right. If I  was break-down-sobbing miserable, I would get help. I’m not Sachiko.”</p>
<p>“Were you going to eat tonight? Honestly?”</p>
<p>“Probably,” Sei lied.</p>
<p>“That’s not <em>all right</em>.”</p>
<p>“It’s close enough for government work. I’m serious, drop it.” <em>What is she doing? This is not how </em>we <em>are. Why doesn’t she realize that? </em>“It’s not befitting of either of us.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about that,” Shimako said, her voice almost pleading. “I’m sick of this.”</p>
<p>“Sick  of what?” Sei asked before she thought about it. If she had thought  about it, she might have apologized and asked Shimako politely to  leave. She wasn’t ready for this. Not yet.</p>
<p><em>When, then?</em></p>
<p><em>Not yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Then,  when? Are you waiting for something? Elapsed time? Some level of  maturity to be reached? What the hell does she need to do, say a  fucking password? </em></p>
<p>“I’m sick of not talking about anything at all. I’m sick of keeping you at arm’s length when you’re hurting. I’m sick of being <em>kept </em>at arm’s length when I’m hurting.”</p>
<p>“Shimako<em>, </em>I—”  How did she explain this? That that was how she did best? That not  everybody needed open-heart surgery every time they had a bad day. That  she just … was not the same as her friends, who would come over, strap  on latex gloves, and start opening up every single fucking part of  their friends’ lives whenever they bumped their proverbial ankle. That  she wasn’t…fucking…<em>nosy. </em>She loved her friends, but some days, they were just so. Fucking. Nosy.</p>
<p><em>Didn’t you just spend the last three days being nosy?</em></p>
<p><em>That’s different. </em></p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p><em>Sachiko actually needed help.</em></p>
<p><em>And you don’t? Ha. Ha ha. And boy, what is the deal with airline food?</em></p>
<p>And  then, Shimako said something that surprised her, but shouldn’t have.  “You don’t need somebody to give you an invasive exam every time you  feel a little sniffle coming on? I know that,<em> Onee-sama</em>.” Sei  realized she should be used to this from Shimako. To being surprised.  “You and I are alike, rememeber? But this is different. This isn’t just  being yelled at and sulking for a while. This isn’t getting a poor  grade on an exam. This isn’t even losing a friend.”</p>
<p>“Then what <em>is </em>it?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t know!” Shimako’s voice actually trembled in frustration, and it  was only then that Sei realized just how hard this was on her. “I don’t  know, all I know is that you’re not taking care of yourself, and when  you get to <em>that </em>point, that’s when you need help. And I wish  you would tell me what it is. I wish you would even just let me help  you, but you won’t. Because we <em>don’t interfere with each other’s lives. </em>That’s an awful way to be.”</p>
<p>“It’s the only way we can be.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true, and you know it. You can be caring without being nosy.”</p>
<p>And  Sei knew it was true, and she knew it was important. It was the reason  she had not pursued Yumi in earnest. It was the reason she had not  pursued any of the Rose Council in earnest. Flirting was fine, and  hell, speaking candidly, if any of them had come around for a casual  tussle in bed, Sei probably would have been all right with that. But  she couldn’t <em>really </em>pursue a relationship with any of them,  because they were all just so. Fucking. Nosy. It was fine for  friendship, and in truth, none of it was related to the malicious  gossip that was the property of housewives across the country, but Sei  needed privacy and she knew it. And even Sei occasionally looked thirty  years down the road, when the beast of time inevitably sucked the  passion of love away and left it with a gentle caring, at best, and she  saw anger and bitterness growing quietly, but maliciously, inside of  her.</p>
<p>But not Shimako.</p>
<p>Shimako knew when to keep her hands off of Sei, and when not to.</p>
<p><em>(Well, not quite her hands.)</em></p>
<p>Sei leaned back and sighed. “I’ve just been lonely lately, okay?”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you call any of us?”</p>
<p>“Not that kind of lonely.”</p>
<p>“Oh. You have been thinking about” <em>(her)</em> “again.”</p>
<p><em>Here it comes.</em></p>
<p>Shimako touched Sei’s hand gently and said…nothing.</p>
<p>And  they stayed like that for quite a while. They simply sat next to one  another, Sei’s hand in Shimako’s, and said nothing. And somehow, during  that time, at some point, Sei simply felt the loneliness drain out of  her.</p>
<p>That, after all, was what Shimako understood so well. She didn’t need to <em>talk</em>. She didn’t need anyone to <em>listen</em>. She didn’t want sympathy or reassuring pats on the back or a shoulder to cry on.</p>
<p>She  just needed somebody to understand, and to hold her hand while she  worked through it on her own. And occasionally, somebody to kick her in  the ass, to not accept her excuses.</p>
<p>And that was what Shimako was  best at. She was awful at giving advice, and her reassuring pat was  probably the most awkward thing Sei had ever witnessed on God’s green  earth.</p>
<p>But she was good at being a hand to hold.</p>
<p>Sei looked  at Shimako closely. Studied her calm face, noted the slim lines of her  neck as they curved into the conservative blouse she wore which ended  much too high for Sei’s liking.</p>
<p>And Sei looked again thirty years  into the future. She didn’t see much—she never did. But instead of  seeing herself nursing bitterness and a need to be alone, she saw  something else.</p>
<p>She saw herself saying to Shimako, <em>I love you</em>. And meaning it.</p>
<p><em>Fuck it.</em></p>
<p>She moved towards Shimako, closing her eyes slowly. Shimako pulled away.</p>
<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>
<p>“No, <em>Onee-sama</em>.”</p>
<p>“No?” Not a challenge, but a question.</p>
<p>“No more of that.” What did <em>that </em>mean? “I made a mistake before, and I don’t want you to make the same mistake.”</p>
<p>“What mistake is that?”</p>
<p>“The mistake of not following through, of not doing something properly.”</p>
<p>Truly,  Shimako was a wise girl. And possessed of a willpower that nobody would  expect by simply looking at her calm, oft-fragile demeanor.</p>
<p>Sei grinned a bit. “Properly, huh.”</p>
<p>“Properly.”</p>
<p>Sei  sighed, and the butterflies started flapping around in her stomach,  trying desperately to cause a typhoon on the other side of the world.  Even now, it was hard. When was the last time she had actually asked  somebody out on a date?</p>
<p>When was the last time she had <em>had </em>a date?</p>
<p>“Shimako, would you like to get coffee with me tomorrow night?”</p>
<p>“In what capacity?”</p>
<p><em>No stone unturned, huh. </em></p>
<p>“In the capacity of a date.”</p>
<p>“Now, in a full sentence, if you would.”</p>
<p>Sei nearly sputtered. “Wh…you little…”</p>
<p>“If you please.” That coy grin. That one that said, <em>got you. </em></p>
<p>Sei loved that grin. Loved it dearly.</p>
<p>“Shimako,  would you go out on a date with me tomorrow night, for coffee?” What an  awful sentence. It was like she was making Japanese her second language.</p>
<p>“I  most certainly would,” Shimako said with a grin, and then she stood up  abruptly, a girl no surer of where she was going than the rest of us.</p>
<p>Sei blinked at her.</p>
<p>“If we’re going out on a date tomorrow, we can’t loiter around together today.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
