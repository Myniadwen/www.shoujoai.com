<pre>Author&#146;s note: Dedicated to the people who worked so hard to give us a 
translated version of Maria-sama ga Miteru.  Wonderful job, minna.  We 
are in your debt.

+++++

       &quot;Why Rosa Chinensis, what a nice surprise,&quot; I say, throwing my 
arms around my slightly shorter friend.

       &quot;It&#39;s great to see you!  And you know, you ought to stop calling 
me that.  Touko is Rosa Chinensis now.&quot;

       &quot;True.  What do you want me to call you?&quot;

       She purses her lips cutely.  &quot;Fukuzawa-san, or Yumi-san.  Or 
Yumi-chan.  Whatever you want, Sei-san.&quot;

       &quot;Hm.  How about &#39;Sexy Yumi&#39;?&quot;

       &quot;Oh you!&quot; she says with mock-frustration.  &quot;You&#39;re never 
serious.&quot;

       &quot;That&#39;s how you like me.&quot;  Her eyes sparkle, and I know I&#39;m 
right.

       &quot;Are you doing anything now?&quot; she asks.

       &quot;I&#39;m not busy.&quot;

       &quot;Come with me; let&#39;s get some tea.&quot;

       Yumi is so much more mature, yet still so loveable.  Once Sachiko 
and Rei graduated, she stepped into her position as a Rose without 
missing a beat.  The Yamayurikai looked to her for leadership and she 
provided it.  She was probably the most admired grande soeur that 
Lillian had seen in quite a few years.  And she, Shimako, and Yoshino 
got along better than I and my fellow Roses had.

       Yumi has a lot of confidence now.  She&#39;s also changed physically, 
of course.  She&#39;s about 165 cm tall, and pretty darn voluptuous.  She 
wears her long hair in braids most of the time.  She walks with an 
enticing sway in her hips and even her smallest gestures have elegance.

       So we go to the small nearby apartment she shares with a roommate 
I haven&#39;t met yet.  As we&#39;re sipping our tea, she begins.  &quot;I&#39;m going to 
college, you know.&quot;

       That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been dreading.  I keep my voice carefree though.  
&quot;I guess so.  You&#39;re so smart, it&#39;d be a waste if you didn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t 
want you to leave, but it&#39;s best that you do.&quot;

       &quot;You&#39;re not going to try to stop me?&quot; she asks, challenge rising 
in her voice.  &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you to.  I figured you&#39;d think, &#39;My 
beloved little sister, Yumi, is going away!&#39;&quot;

       I don&#39;t answer as fast as I should, and her joke becomes 
meaningful during the short pause.  I look away, not wanting to meet her 
eyes.  &quot;I didn&#39;t want to consider the possibility.  I&#39;ll miss the sounds 
my kawaii kaiju onee-chan makes.&quot;

       Suddenly, she&#39;s hugging me from behind!  I didn&#39;t see her get up 
from her seat!  I gasp involuntarily.  She giggles at that.  &quot;Now who 
sounds like a little monster?&quot; she teases, her breath warm on my ear.  
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Sei.  I&#39;m going to Lillian University.  We&#39;ll be together 
for a while longer.  I couldn&#39;t leave you, silly!&quot;

       &quot;Kami-sama, arigatou,&quot; I say quietly.

       &quot;I still want a graduation gift from you though,&quot; she announces, 
moving from behind me to beside me.  Her gaze strikes me like a 
lightning bolt.

       &quot;Anything,&quot; I murmur, trapped by the intensity in her beautiful 
eyes.

       &quot;Kiss,&quot; she says simply.

       Her full pink lips, so soft and sweet, touch, embrace, caress 
mine.  She is tender but not timid, and her mouth gradually opens.  
Shudders of excitement and wonder race through my body.  This kiss is 
everything I&#39;ve dreamed--no, more.  My breathing slows to match hers.  
My pulse pounds.  Her strong, gentle arms hold me close.

       At last she releases me.  Her cheeks are pink (mine probably are 
too) and her eyes are glittering.

       &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that forever,&quot; I confess.

       &quot;I know,&quot; she says, laughing softly.  &quot;The way you flirt--I 
wonder who didn&#39;t know?&quot;

       &quot;Too obvious?&quot; I say, trying to look indignant and failing.  
&quot;Your resistance was only token, if that.  You enjoyed it too much, you 
little temptress!&quot;

       &quot;Sei,&quot; she says, becoming serious, &quot;Sachiko needed me; then Touko 
needed me.  Can you forgive me for making you wait so long?&quot;

       &quot;Forever isn&#39;t too long to wait for you,&quot; I answer.

       &quot;But even one second is too long to wait for you,&quot; she replies, 
and leans in to kiss me again.

       When we draw apart, she wipes my tears.  &quot;Is this real?&quot; I 
whisper.

       &quot;Of course,&quot; she answers.  &quot;Aishiteru.  Life happens--no 
guarantees.  But I will do my best for you.&quot;

       &quot;I love you too, Yumi.&quot;
