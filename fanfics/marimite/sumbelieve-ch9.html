<h1>Something to Believe (part 9 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../marimite/sumbelieve-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Sitting on a bus, Yumi pressed her forehead against the cool glass, 
watching as buildings flew past in a blur of lights and motion. When it 
first arrived at the stop, she had been so lost in thought that the 
driver had called out to her, asking if she wanted to board or not. 
Although she had been embarrassed by the incident Yumi found she 
couldn&#39;t help slipping back into that state of mind as she soon as she 
sat down. Sachiko&#39;s words kept echoing in her head, dogging her 
constantly.

&quot;She&#39;s in love with you, Yumi.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t like her oneesama to lie, especially to her, so Yumi knew 
there was truth in her words. But all the same, she couldn&#39;t comprehend 
the idea of Touko being in love with her. If Touko loved her then why 
was she cold at times? Why did she insist in trying to reunite her with 
Sachiko? Why didn&#39;t she act the slightest bit like she was in love?

Before she left, Yumi voiced these questions to Sachiko who smiled sadly 
and said that Yumi knew the answers already. She just had to think about 
Touko and what kind of person she was to realize them. And that&#39;s what 
Yumi had been doing ever since she left the younger girl&#39;s house but the 
answers refused to come. Heaving a sigh and watching as her breath 
fogged up the window, Yumi thought yet again about Touko and what kind 
of girl she was. As she did, Yumi wondered vaguely if coming up with a 
list of Touko&#39;s characteristics would help.

Excited by the idea, Yumi searched through her bag and pulled out a pen 
and paper to begin jotting things down. She decided the best way to go 
about it would be to do it like those free thinking exercises. To simply 
consider Touko in her mind and write down the words that popped into her 
head as she focused on her. Smiling widely at this, Yumi set about 
writing. The list came to her surprisingly fast at first as she quickly 
wrote down the following:

Loyal.

Stubborn.

Feisty.

Intelligent.

Cute but hates it when you tell her so.

Outgoing.

Motivated.

Caring.

Smart Aleck.

Brave.

Grumpy.

Strangely shy.

Curious.

Skeptical.

Guarded.

Yumi paused as an image of Touko came to her, an unreadable but equally 
unbearable emptiness in her eyes and a twisted smile on her features, as 
if she knew far too much about the world and the people in it and hated 
herself for it. Biting her lip at this image, Yumi looked down at her 
list and wrote two more things.

Hurt.

Lonely.

Staring at the words, Yumi found the answers to her questions. Touko was 
cold to her because she was hurt, she had been hurting for so very long 
that maybe she didn&#39;t know any other way of existing. Hurt by how her 
family ignored her, how she was treated like a commodity, not a person, 
and not even a very valuable commodity at that. Growing up like that how 
easy would it be to trust another person? To believe their actions and 
feelings towards you were genuine and not some attempt at manipulation? 
And of course you would distrust anyone you knew was trying to 
manipulate you, no matter their reason.

Loyalty and stubbornness were why Touko was trying her best to reunite 
her with Sachiko. She truly loved Sachiko like a big sister and was 
fiercely loyal to her. From the little she knew, it seemed to Yumi that 
Sachiko was the lone family member who cared for Touko, who gave her 
attention and love when everyone else would not. Because of that, Touko 
valued Sachiko&#39;s happiness more than her own and she believed Yumi to be 
the source of that happiness. Which meant she had to bring them back 
together to make Sachiko happy again, despite her own feelings. Even 
when it was obvious that Sachiko wouldn&#39;t go along with her plans, Touko 
stubbornly refused to accept it, not wanting to contend with the 
possibility of her beloved big sister remaining unhappy when she had 
happiness within her grasp.

Touko rarely dropped her guard and it was this that kept her from 
revealing her feelings. They were hidden away in some deep recess of her 
heart where she knew they would be safe. Where they couldn&#39;t be hurt by 
Yumi&#39;s potential rejection and they stayed in that dark place, alone and 
unappreciated. Perhaps wanting to be released when it seemed as if Yumi 
returned her feelings but loyalty forcing them to remain hidden to help 
ensure Sachiko&#39;s happiness once again. But even though Touko tried so 
very hard to hide her love Yumi could see now how it emerged in the 
smallest but most significant ways. How she was always subtly looking 
out for the older girl&#39;s welfare, how she stalwartly supported her, 
though she did make a big show of complaining as she did. Once again in 
attempt to guard herself, to keep herself safe, maybe from her own 
feelings.

Running her fingers over the list, Yumi looked at it in something akin 
to shock. Touko really was in love with her. She had been for months, 
perhaps longer. The concept was foreign and a little frightening and 
Yumi hated herself for feeling this way. It was what she wanted, wasn&#39;t 
it? For Touko to love her? She had been chasing after that just as much 
as getting Touko to accept her as a grande soeur. So why was it now that 
she knew Touko loved her, was in love with her, she wasn&#39;t ecstatic?

Because she wasn&#39;t sure she returned those feelings.

Yumi loved Touko but she didn&#39;t know if she was in love with her. 
Shutting her eyes tightly, Yumi rested her head against the window with 
a slight thump, not caring in the slightest the pain this caused her. 
How could she have done it? She chased after Touko like she was a brand 
new toy, shouting at the top of her lungs how much she wanted it, only 
to stare at it blankly when it was finally given to her. Opening her 
eyes, Yumi stared out into the darkness and said, &quot;I&#39;m a horrible 
person.&quot;

And really, she was. She had been playing with Touko for so long without 
ever really knowing what she wanted. All the time longing for Sachiko 
and letting Touko see that. Of course the younger girl never let her 
know about her feelings! Touko knew this would be her reaction. Guilt 
and confusion and a sinking feeling of regret. Not exactly the desired 
response when confessing your love.

What did she always say about Touko? That she could fall in love with 
her. And really, Yumi knew she could. It was simply that she never saw 
herself really allowing it because Sachiko was there, lurking in the 
back of her mind. Always present in her thoughts and it seemed to Yumi 
that as long as Sachiko held that place there wasn&#39;t room for Touko. But 
now...

Sachiko was asking Yumi to let her leave that place in her heart and to 
allow Touko in. Because Touko loved her just as much as Sachiko did, 
perhaps more, because unlike Sachiko she wouldn&#39;t let anything come 
between them. Once Yumi accepted her love, she would devote herself to 
the older girl, no matter what anyone might say about them. The opinions 
of the general public didn&#39;t matter in the slightest to Touko, that was 
something Yumi knew first hand, and Sachiko had said Touko wouldn&#39;t 
share her problems with the family. That she couldn&#39;t be swayed by their 
words or wants.

The scary thing was how easily it could happen, to start loving Touko. 
Honestly, Yumi thought she already did because ever since she left the 
house she had been obsessed with thoughts of Touko and her feelings and 
how she had probably hurt her over the past few months and how she could 
possibly make it up to her. Not once had Sachiko&#39;s rejection entered her 
mind, that final and unwavering goodbye that ended their romantic 
relationship for good. Only she found guilt overwhelming her because 
while she thought she had begun to love Touko, to fall in love with her, 
she wasn&#39;t sure she could ever stop loving Sachiko. And would Touko 
really want her when she felt that way?

This thought plagued Yumi for the rest of the night.

---

Pressing her hand flat against the door to Touko&#39;s room, Sachiko 
reminded herself why she was doing this. She loved Yumi but she was also 
painfully aware of her own faults. The opinions of others mattered far 
too much to her, she had been raised to care more about what everyone 
else thought of her than she herself did. Because of that, continuing 
her relationship with Yumi would be impossible. Unless they were to do 
it in secret and Sachiko couldn&#39;t ask that of the younger girl. Though 
she had a feeling if she was to ask Yumi might reluctantly agree and 
that reluctance would slowly kill their love for each other, she was 
sure of it. That was why she was doing this, that and the knowledge 
Touko loved Yumi as she did.

And Touko, unlike her, had very little care about the opinions of 
others. Particularly those of their disapproving family members, 
including her own parents, because they themselves were the very same 
people who had paid her so little care in the past. If they couldn&#39;t 
show her any respect then why should she return it? Sachiko knew all too 
well from various experiences this was the younger girl&#39;s stance on 
their family. Something that made her perfect for Yumi because she would 
never be swayed by their disapproval. In fact, Sachiko wondered if Touko 
would even notice it.

Giving the door a soft knock, Sachiko waited a moment before opening it. 
When she did, she saw Touko looking at her from where she sat on her 
bed, eyes wide with surprise and glistening with unshed tears, her right 
hand holding her mobile phone. &quot;Sachiko-oneesama!&quot; she exclaimed, 
jumping to her feet. Her eyes remained fixed on Sachiko until someone on 
the other end of the phone said something that caused Touko to tear her 
eyes away. Offering Sachiko an apologetic smile, Touko turned around and 
conversed quietly with whoever she was speaking with. A few seconds 
later, she was turning her phone off and looking at Sachiko with an 
expression of definite concern as she placed the phone on her 
nightstand. Looking up from the small table, Touko appeared lost for the 
proper words and finally said a bit hesitantly, &quot;Where is Yumi-sama?&quot;

&quot;Yumi has gone home,&quot; said Sachiko rather solemnly.

&quot;Then...&quot; Touko trailed off, unable to say the words, face turning red 
with embarassment at having been caught.

&quot;Your plan was a good one, Touko,&quot; murmured Sachiko, stepping close to 
her cousin. &quot;And I understand quite well why you did it but I must ask 
you to cease your efforts. I&#39;ve made my decision and Yumi has accepted 
it and so should you.&quot;

&quot;But it isn&#39;t right!&quot; declared Touko fiercely, moving quickly from 
around her bed to stand in front of Sachiko. &quot;Why should you be unhappy 
just because they want to merge the companies? It&#39;s not a marriage, it&#39;s 
a business deal!&quot;

Tilting her head, Sachiko&#39;s eyes traveled about the room, a small smile 
playing on her lips when she saw a picture of herself and Touko aboard 
the family yacht, Sachiko trying her best to keep her hat on her head 
and Touko beaming at her. It was only three short years ago but oh, how 
life was so much simpler then. &quot;You might be right about that, Touko, 
but it hardly matters,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;They want this marriage and 
because of that the reasons behind it are inconsequential.&quot;

&quot;But&#151;&quot; Touko tried again only to be silenced by Sachiko stepping forward 
and placing an index finger over her mouth.

&quot;You mustn&#39;t be so romantically self destructive, Touko,&quot; said Sachiko 
almost playfully, though a quiet sadness shone in her eyes. &quot;I know you 
would rather die than admit it but this is good news for you if you 
would only accept it as such.&quot;

&quot;Sachiko-oneesama?&quot; Touko said her name in a disbelieving whisper.

&quot;I know how you feel about Yumi,&quot; continued Sachiko kindly and Touko 
immediately dropped her head, face turning red again, and she kept her 
gaze as far from Sachiko as she could manage. Sighing at this reaction, 
Sachiko reached down to hold her cousin&#39;s face in her hands, after a 
long moment Touko relented and allowed Sachiko to lift her head, though 
she kept her eyes away from the older girl. &quot;Touko,&quot; she said her name 
with such depth of understanding that the younger girl couldn&#39;t help but 
draw her gaze to Sachiko. &quot;I don&#39;t blame you for how you feel, I never 
have.&quot; Sachiko gave a wry smile. &quot;More than anyone, I can understand how 
easy it is to fall under Yumi&#39;s spell. Especially when you&#39;ve never 
encountered caring such as hers.&quot;

&quot;I never meant for it to happen!&quot; cried Touko in tormented tones, 
clutching at Sachiko&#39;s hands and looking up at her with eyes that begged 
for forgiveness. &quot;Please, believe me!&quot;

&quot;I believe you,&quot; murmured Sachiko gently, pulling her cousin to her in a 
warm embrace. Leaning down, she stroked Touko&#39;s hair and whispered in 
her ear, &quot;I told you I understood how easy it is to fall in love with 
Yumi, didn&#39;t I? I could never blame you for such a thing. I know all to 
well how it&#39;s beyond your own control, no matter how you wish it wasn&#39;t 
so. I also know how your guilt at falling in love with Yumi is what is 
pressing you to get her to return to me, despite the choices I&#39;ve made. 
But Touko,&quot; Sachiko said her name tenderly but firmly, her gaze turning 
fierce. &quot;You must stop. She needs you now.&quot; Pausing for a long moment, 
the older girl closed her eyes and released a shuddering sigh. &quot;If I 
cannot be with Yumi there is no one else I would rather have take care 
of her than you, Touko. I&#39;ve known you since you were a child and I&#39;ve 
watched you grow and I know what kind of person you are. Though you try 
to hide your kindness beneath a prickly exterior I know it&#39;s there. 
Please,&quot; Sachiko pleaded, gripping the younger girl&#39;s hands tightly. 
&quot;Love her and treat her well. Treat her as I should have.&quot;

Before Touko could formulate a reply, Sachiko slipped away, closing the 
door softly behind her, leaving Touko stunned as she stepped backwards 
and sat down on her bed. All the while wondering exactly what she should 
do now.</pre>
