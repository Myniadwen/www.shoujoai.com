<h1>Touko's Adventures in Wonderland</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marimite/index.html">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gaffney.html">Sean Gaffney</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Touko pursed her lips, staring at the note in front of her.

*Touko-chan, please come to the front of the mansion.  We have 
an event that we need you to be a part of.  Fukuzawa Yumi.*

Touko sniffed.  She&#39;s not my soeur, she thought, even though she 
acts like it.  But she feels the need to order me around like 
she is.  Well, okay, she doesn&#39;t order me around.  She just 
suggests things.  And I do them.  Because... I don&#39;t know.  
Because she smiles at me, and talks about how sad she&#39;d be if I 
wasn&#39;t there.  And because I&#39;m a complete and total sheep with 
no will of my own.

Touko was someone who prided herself on her ability to speak her 
mind.  Today she&#39;d walk right up to Yumi-sama and tell her that 
Yumi-sama had no right ordering her around like this when she 
was not part of the Yamayurikai, and from now on would simply 
have to do whatever insipid task she had on hand without Touko&#39;s 
help.

Of course, in order to do this, she&#39;d have to go to the mansion, 
just like Yumi-sama had asked.  Pathetic.  Sheep.

She found herself at the door, and saw another note pinned to 
it.

*Just go on inside and go up to the meeting room... Shimako and 
Noriko are already hard at work.  --Y*

There was a little smiley face next to the Y.  For anyone else 
(including Touko herself), it would have been forced cuteness.  
But Yumi-sama was just sort of naturally cute.  Even Touko 
couldn&#39;t deny that.

Touko sighed as she walked up the stairs.  It wasn&#39;t as if Yumi-
sama wasn&#39;t nice to her, or helpful.  Touko&#39;s recent problems 
with the drama club had been very trying, and Yumi-sama had been 
right there for her.  Some days Touko wondered if she should 
just accept Yumi-sama&#39;s rosary.  At least as her soeur she&#39;d 
have some sort of say in things.

Not that Yumi-sama had actually offered Touko her rosary.  Or, 
for that matter, given any clear indication that she had even 
considered it.  Sachiko-oneesama had been pressuring her to 
choose a soeur, but Touko suspected that if it was left up to 
Yumi-sama, she&#39;d simply leave school with Sachiko-oneesama and 
go become her live-in companion.

Plus there was Kanako, the &#39;other candidate&#39;, according to Mami-
san.  Everyone in the school knew that when Yumi-sama eventually 
picked her petite soeur, there were only two possible candidates 
- her and Kanako.  To Touko that was no choice at all.  Kanako 
was psychotic.  Sure, bad family life, but basically psychotic 
anyway.

Luckily Sachiko-oneesama had been taking more of a hand in 
Kanako&#39;s life lately, meaning the young girl had less time to 
stalk Yumi-sama.

Unluckily, that gave Yumi-sama time to do things like whatever 
it was she wanted Touko to help with.  Touko sighed and opened 
the door.

&quot;GokigenYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!&quot;

Shimako lay back on the table, her blouse askew and her skirt 
missing, her hand tweaking at one of her nipples.  Her breath 
was coming in ragged gasps.  Between her legs was the face of 
Touko&#39;s friend, Nijou Noriko.  Who had her hand gently stroking 
the inside of Shimako&#39;s thighs, and her tongue stroking 
something else even more intimate.

Touko turned beet red.  They hadn&#39;t even noticed her come in.

She knew that this sort of thing went on at the school, though 
it wasn&#39;t nearly as pervasive as new first-years thought.  Some 
petite soeurs were just... very close to their oneesamas.  It 
was the sort of thing no one talked about.  And certainly she 
knew Shimako and Noriko were incredibly close, even for soeurs.  
She really wasn&#39;t all that surprised by them being intimate.

She was surprised by them being intimate on the Rose Council 
table.

Shimako&#39;s cries grew louder and more throaty.  All the first-
years had assumed when they originally met Shimako that she was 
destined to become a nun.  Noriko had once said that she and 
Shimako had had discussions about the topic, where Noriko had 
tried to show her other points of view.  This must have been 
what she meant.

Touko shuffled back, trying to quietly abandon the room (and the 
mansion).  Suddenly Shimako let out a long cry, and sat up.

&quot;Oh.  Noriko, Touko-chan is here.&quot;  Touko stared, as, sitting 
up, it was now apparent that Shimako was wearing a pair of big, 
floppy rabbit ears.

Noriko groaned, and removed herself from between her oneesama&#39;s 
legs, her face still damp.  &quot;Your timing sucks, Touko-chan.&quot;

&quot;And so do you, apparently,&quot; Touko murmured, not really 
cognizant of what she was saying.

Noriko got up and reached under Shimako&#39;s torso, lowering her 
mouth onto her breast to suckle for a few seconds before pulling 
out another card that looked to have Yumi&#39;s writing on it.  
&quot;Congratulations, you&#39;ve hit the first part of the scavenger 
hunt.&quot;

&quot;SCAVENGER hunt!&quot; Touko exclaimed.  &quot;What am I supposed to 
find?&quot;

&quot;That would be telling,&quot; Noriko grinned.  She then moaned 
slightly as Shimako&#39;s hands were beginning to roam around under 
her blouse.  &quot;You can go read that card, or watch some more. 
Whichever makes you happy.&quot;

Touko turned and fled the room, slamming the door behind her.  
She felt herself breathing harder, which she imagined was from 
the added stress and not from seeing her best friend get it on 
with Rosa Gigantea.

She looked down at the card, once again written in Yumi&#39;s sloppy 
lettering.  *Touko-chan.  I hope Noriko-chan was able to get 
this to you.  Can you meet me downstairs?  Yoshino-san is having 
trouble breaking in the gym room we just added.  --Y*

Touko stared.  And then shook her head.  I have an excuse to 
walk out, she thought firmly.  I can say that I was traumatised 
by Noriko having sex.  No, I can&#39;t.  Because if I talk about sex 
in front of Yumi-sama I think Sachiko-oneesama would rise up and 
bury me in an unmarked grave.

In any case, she was getting out of here.  She headed down the 
stairs, her eyes locked on the front door...

...and suddenly the stairs folded up flat, and she found herself 
sliding down into darkness.

***

Touko fell for what seemed like forever.  Certainly it was 
several floors, and she started to wonder whether she was having 
a weird fever dream.  Finally she shot out onto a floor covered 
with gym mats, gasping.

She stood up, still clutching Yumi-sama&#39;s note in her hand, and 
realized this was the gym room that had been mentioned in it.  
She didn&#39;t really get much of a chance to study it, however, as 
her eyes were quickly drawn to the spectacle in the center of 
the room.

Normally, Yoshino-sama would be enough to take in.  She was 
dressed in an old-fashioned British fox-hunting outfit, except 
Touko was fairly certain that those outfits weren&#39;t meant to 
have cut-outs where the breasts were.  She had a fancy yellow 
hat, and a yellow riding crop, both the color of her Rose 
House.  And she had that look that people had learned was 
Yoshino-sama&#39;s &#39;insane&#39; look, the one that caused students to 
flee the immediate vicinity whenever they saw it.

But compared to Rosa Foetida, Yoshino-sama looked positively 
normal.  Rei was dressed in a leather bikini-like outfit, only 
with a few more straps biting into her legs and chest.  Her 
mouth was drawn back by a metal bridle, with blinders.  The... 
well, the panty minimum back of the outfit was enhanced by a 
tail.  Yes, a tail, made from what seemed to be real hair.  
Touko prayed fervently that it was held on merely by glue, 
rather than any of the other, more disturbing options that 
presented themselves.  Finally, she was wearing gloves that 
were shaped like hooves.

She was also, Touko was slightly relieved to note, blushing 
crimson red and looking down at the floor.  At least someone is 
embarrassed about all this, Touko thought, looking at Yoshino-
sama&#39;s proud smirk.

&quot;Hello there, Touko-chan.&quot;

Touko eeped and spun around, looking into the face of a woman 
she had never met, but knew was the former Rosa Foetida from 
photos she&#39;d seen at Sachiko-oneesama&#39;s mansion.  She was 
carrying a clipboard, and wore a headband... and nothing else.

&quot;I want to apologize for the behavior you&#39;re witnessing.&quot;

Touko was beyond bothering to be polite.  &quot;You *think*?&quot; she 
exclaimed in disbelief.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Torii Eriko said primly.  She strode over to where 
the other two were, managing to look graceful and elegant even 
in her nudity.  &quot;Rei-chan should be looking you directly in the 
eye,&quot; and as she said this she grabbed Rei&#39;s short hair and 
yanked it back, eliciting a muffled cry from the young woman.  
&quot;And kneeling tall and proud, as a pony should.&quot;  With this, she 
jammed her knee into Rei&#39;s back, forcing her upright.

Touko just stared, her mouth wide.

Eriko-sama stepped back, and Rei stayed where she was, breasts 
jutting out firmly, her eyes staring directly into Touko&#39;s now.  
They seemed to smolder; Touko guessed it was Eriko-sama who had 
put that there.  Wonderful, she thought, Rosa Foetida&#39;s into 
pain.

Eriko-sama moved over to Yoshino-sama, whose look of pride had 
turned into uncertainty.  She grabbed the crop from Yoshino-
sama&#39;s unresisting hand.  &quot;This is totally unacceptable, 
Yoshino-chan.  I graduated from Lillian with the understanding 
that you would take Rei in hand to make her into the perfect 
pony.  And what do I find when Yumi-chan invites me back?  She 
can&#39;t even look a first-year in the eye.  What do you have to 
say for yourself?&quot;

Yoshino-sama&#39;s eyes were wide and fearful.  &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, 
Eriko-sama...&quot;

Eriko-sama raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Sorry?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do better!  I promise!&quot;  Yoshino-sama sounded panicked, 
but there was also a trace of arousal there.

Shaking her head, Eriko-sama walked over to Yoshino-sama and 
yanked on her riding pants, pulling them to the floor.  Touko 
was utterly unsurprised to find that she wasn&#39;t wearing any 
panties under them.  &quot;I think you need to remember what real 
discipline is, Yoshino-chan...&quot;

She then reached out with her free hand and smacked Yoshino-sama 
hard on the bottom.  Yoshino-sama twitched, but made no noise - 
Touko guessed that silence was part of the punishment.  She 
shifted on her feet, and cleared her throat.

Eriko-sama smacked Yoshino-sama once more, then turned.  &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Touko, you&#39;re right.  We musn&#39;t keep you.&quot;  She walked 
over to Rosa Foetida, bent over, and whispered something in her 
ear.  Rei-sama immediately relaxed and got up, seeming to turn 
back to normal, or as normal as Rosa Foetida ever could be when 
wearing a bridle.  She walked over to a pile of school uniforms 
in the back and retrieved another card, which she then handed 
to Touko.

Touko blushed and looked down, but managed to look back up at 
Rosa Foetida.  Hell, maybe the older woman would start slapping 
her around if she didn&#39;t, who knew?  &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Yoshino-sama had straightened up too, which drew another painful 
swat from Eriko-sama.  &quot;Excuse me, I only gave one of you 
permission to move.  You truly have regressed while I was gone.&quot;

Touko looked at this, then back at Rosa Foetida.  Who winked.

Touko shook her head and headed out the exit, hearing the sharp 
smacks on Yoshino-sama&#39;s bottom fade into the distance.

*Touko-chan - I hope the others managed to have a good workout.  
Did you get sweaty as well?  Come to the baths, they&#39;re towards 
the end of the corridor on the right.  --Y*

Was this really Yumi-sama doing this, Touko wondered.  She knew 
Yumi-sama wasn&#39;t as innocent as she appeared, but this seemed a 
little ridiculous...

***

The baths were as well-laid out as the gymnasium had been, 
looking more like a hot springs than a public bath.  Touko 
peered into the room slowly, not sure who she&#39;d find in there.  
She was rather surprised to see the school newspaper&#39;s two 
reporters, sitting back in deep relaxation, sake cups in their 
hands.

Mami-sama was also gently caressing Minako-sama&#39;s breast, but by 
now Touko wasn&#39;t startled.  She was rather annoyed, though, at 
their presence in the Rose Mansion.  &quot;Do the others know you&#39;re 
here?&quot; she said without preamble.

Minako-sama&#39;s eyes opened and she smiled slyly.  &quot;Of course, 
little Touko-chan.  We&#39;re all part of the master plan!&quot;

Mami-sama sighed, and pinched Minako-sama&#39;s nipple.  &quot;Stop 
that.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not a convincing way to get me to stop,&quot; Minako-sama 
murmured.

&quot;Can we just pretend I watched you two have sex so that you can 
tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;

Mami-sama smiled at Touko, trying to look sympathetic.  &quot;We 
don&#39;t really know the story either, Touko-chan.  Oneesama has 
been trying to figure it out herself.&quot;  She looked askance at 
the sake.  &quot;Unfortunately, as that bottle&#39;s gotten emptier, the 
theories have gotten weirder.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot; Minako-sama shouted, flailing her arms and 
accidentally groping Mami-sama.  Well, Touko assumed it was 
accidental.  &quot;Remember how you said my theory about killing 
Touko-chan, scooping out her insides, then inflating her and 
making a blow up doll for Yumi-chan was ludicrous?&quot;

Touko blanched, and Mami-sama thrust Minako-sama back down into 
the bath.  &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, it must be duplicates!  The real Touko-chan is 
destroyed, and a compliant clone robot is created, programmed to 
worship Yumi-chan.  The robot would think it was real, of 
course, and just assume that Yumi-chan had converted her to 
sapphism by benefit of being really cute and huggable and 
luscious -- ow!&quot;

&quot;Stop dreaming of fucking Yumi-chan and get back to fucking me,&quot; 
Mami-sama growled.  She turned to Touko.  &quot;Never let Oneesama 
near alcohol - she starts plotting how to seduce the entire 
student body.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; said Touko, beginning to feel a lot like a Greek 
chorus.

&quot;Or maybe it&#39;s Satou-san!  She never really left, did she, 
always lurking over there at the University, watching over us 
all with her fingers of doom and sexy breasts.  I bet she&#39;s a 
vampire.  It explains so much.  She must have enthralled Yumi 
right before she graduated, which explains how the girl got a 
backbone so quickly...&quot;

&quot;Good old Red-eyes Satou, they call her...&quot; Mami-sama said, 
smirking.

Minako-sama stood up shakily, and pointed her finger at Touko.  
Touko averted her eyes from the display this created.  &quot;Do you 
feel it, Touko-chan?  Can you feel the Yamayurikai&#39;s fingers 
slowly creeping through your brain?  You&#39;re already beginning to 
feel... CONFUSED, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Touko nodded.  &quot;I think that&#39;s a given.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s how it starts!&quot;  Minako-sama nodded her head, looking 
very smug.  &quot;The confusion starts in the brain, and then 
sloooooowly spreads to the pussy.&quot;

Touko put her face to her hand.  &quot;Oh, for god&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;We know there&#39;s mind control at work here, Touko-chan, we&#39;re 
just not s--&quot;

There was a loud splash, as Minako-sama fell back into the bath.  
Mami-sama was behind her, a bucket in her hand, slightly dented.  
&quot;Sorry about that, but I think she was about to move on to how 
Rosa Chinensis is secretly an Illuminatus, and I can&#39;t tell you 
how bored I am with that theory.&quot;

&quot;Can I just get Yumi-sama&#39;s stupid card?&quot;  Touko was beginning 
to feel a bit dizzy.  She wanted to get the hell out of here.

&quot;Here,&quot; Mami-sama said, moving the sake bottle and handing Touko 
another white card.  &quot;For what it&#39;s worth, Touko-chan, I really 
have no idea what the hell is going on.  We got a phone call 
saying to come to the Mansion, and were taken here and given 
alcohol by Rosa Foetida... um, the former Rosa Foetida.&quot;

&quot;And she said to just get drunk and have sex until I arrive?&quot;

Mami grinned.  &quot;No, but they left sake.  And when oneesama gets 
drunk, she gets paranoid and horny.  I can fix the latter.&quot;

Touko sighed, and turned.  &quot;Bye,&quot; she said curtly.

&quot;Good luck!  If you find out what&#39;s going on, can we get an 
exclusive?&quot;  But Touko was out the door.  She looked at the 
card.

*Touko-chan -- I apologize if Minako-sama was appalling.  The 
alcohol was a necessary evil.  Can you grab some rolls of film 
from the orange utility closet ahead of you and bring them to 
Tsutako-chan at the top of the stairs to the left?  I promise 
things will become clearer.  --Y*

Touko resisted the urge to crumple the card into a ball.  
Instead she moved to the closet, grabbed the film, and took the 
stairs two at a time.  &quot;This can&#39;t end fast enough,&quot; she 
muttered.

***

As Touko reached the top of the stairs, she began to hear a 
rhythmic clicking of a camera shutter.  Presumably Tsutako-sama 
was with someone else, and since Mami-sama was down in the baths 
with Minako-sama, there was really only one other person Touko 
could imagine in there.

Sure enough, as Touko entered the room, there was Naitou Shouko, 
Tsutako-sama&#39;s Number One Fan, lying on a large bed in her 
uniform.  Although her uniform had been &#39;modified&#39; quite a bit.  
Touko was positive that Sachiko-oneesama would never tie Yumi-
sama to the headboard with her cravat.  Or at least would use a 
much better knot.

Tsutako-sama was behind the camera, taking picture after picture 
of Shouko-chan looking tied up and helpless.  Tsutako-sama was 
also topless, but after what Touko had witnessed earler, this 
seemed positively civilized.  The camera sat on a tripod, 
allowing Tsutako-sama the greatest freedom of movement.

Tsutako-sama didn&#39;t even turn to acknowledge Touko&#39;s presence, 
but just reached out a hand in her direction.  Touko made a 
little noise in the back of her throat.  However, she gave the 
film to Tsutako-sama as Yumi-sama had asked.

Tsutako-sama had noticed Touko&#39;s reaction, though, and chuckled.  
&quot;You don&#39;t seem quite as horrified as I thought you&#39;d be.  
Interested, or just bored?&quot;

&quot;I expected this of you,&quot; Touko said truthfully.  &quot;After all, 
you don&#39;t even bother to hide it on campus, skulking around with 
your camera all the time.&quot;  Touko was starting to recover her 
usual brashness, and decided to let loose on Tsutako-sama a bit.  
&quot;You keep talking about finding interesting stories, but isn&#39;t 
it strange that your pictures are always of soeurs in close 
embracing, or looking longingly at each other?  One might almost 
think you were obsessed.&quot;

Tsutako-sama smiled, and moved away from her camera.  &quot;Yes, I 
admit I like to photograph pretty girls.  I don&#39;t exactly make 
that a secret, Touko-chan.&quot;  She moved towards the bed, where 
Shouko-chan was gazing at her breasts with a longing expression.  
This surprised Touko even less, having spoken with the girl 
several times.  Most first-years were rather shocked when they 
heard about the occasional sexual relationship among their 
peers; Shouko-chan was actively seeking it out.

Tsutako-sama continued her speech.  &quot;But don&#39;t you find it
strange that I have no trouble at all finding those pictures?  
People talk about how there are some couples whose love is 
physical, but it&#39;s far more the norm than you&#39;d think.  
Everyone knows the quiet places, the out of the way areas 
where it&#39;s private... and then the inhibitions fall.&quot;

She crept on top of the bed, looking almost feline, and Touko 
noticed that she had a rosary wrapped around her thigh, as if it 
was a garter.  Shouko-chan seemed to notice it for the first 
time as well, and began to struggle with her bonds.  Tsutako-
sama wasn&#39;t paying any attention to her, though or at least not 
outwardly appearing to.

&quot;They could still be caught at any moment, Touko-chan.  The 
sweetest kisses are the ones with a touch of danger about them.  
Forbidden fantasies on a sunny afternoon.  You have to be quick, 
there&#39;s always the danger of getting caught.&quot;

&quot;Am I going to have to sit through another lecture while you 
have sex with Shouko-chan?&quot; Touko said.  She was beginning to 
lose her will to fight.

Much to her surprise, Tsutako-sama yelled back at her.  &quot;If 
that&#39;s what gets through to you, then yes, I will!  Do you have 
any idea what you&#39;re doing to Yumi-chan?  She&#39;s given you every 
kind of opportunity, goodness knows why.  She&#39;s helped you when 
everyone else on campus would be happy to see you fail, and yet 
you don&#39;t give her what she so desperately desires?&quot;

&quot;Yumi-sama&#39;s not like that!  She wouldn&#39;t do anything like 
this!&quot; Touko desperately shouted.  &quot;And you&#39;re one to talk!  I 
notice you still have your own rosary!&quot;

Tsutako-sama grinned.  &quot;I had to buy this one specially - I 
never had an oneesama to get it from.  But you&#39;re right, I have 
been cruel.&quot;  She turned back to Shouko-chan, and bent low, 
placing her forehead against the younger girl&#39;s.  Her voice 
turned serious.  &quot;Shouko-chan, do you want to take my rosary?  I 
can promise you this isn&#39;t because of Touko being here, or any 
bets or dares.  I want this.  I want to take your hand and guide 
you as an oneesama, and I want to see you happy.&quot;  She then bent 
right next to Shouko-chan&#39;s ear and whispered something Touko 
didn&#39;t hear, but considering how Shouko-chan turned a deep shade 
of crimson, she could guess what the gist was.

Tsutako-sama straghtened back up.  &quot;And despite the atmosphere, 
this is a &quot;sacred ritual&quot;, as Rosa Chinensis would say.  Will 
you have my rosary?&quot;

Shouko-chan looked up at Tsutako-sama, sheer adoration in her 
eyes.  &quot;I accept.&quot;

Tsutako-sama smiled, then hiked up her skirt, revealing her 
rosary and a long expanse of thigh.  &quot;Then take it.&quot;

There was a tearing sound, as Shouko-chan&#39;s bonds tore and she 
pounced on Tsutako-sama, who fell backwards laughing.  She then 
noticed that Touko was still in the room.  &quot;Oh, right, Touko-
chan.  Get out.&quot;

Well, at least I don&#39;t have to stay and watch the sex, Touko 
thought.  &quot;Don&#39;t I need a card?&quot;

Tsutako moaned, then focused again.  &quot;Right, Yumi-chan&#39;s card.  
Under the tripod leg.  Don&#39;t move the camera or I will break you 
in two.&quot;

Touko moved over to the tripod and took the card, her movements 
rather robotic.  She left the room and leaned up against the 
wall for a minute, then glanced at the card.

*Touko-chan:  Thank you very much for delivering the film.  
We&#39;re nearly done!  If you could just go over to the gaming room 
(6 doors down on your right), they&#39;ll have what you need.  Keep 
smiling!  --Y*

Touko shook her head - and then stopped in mid-motion.  Her mind 
went back to the argument she&#39;d had with Tsutako-sama.

Touko prided herself on knowing what others were thinking.  
People like Noriko and Shouko were open books to her, and she 
was convinced that the easiest person on the entire campus to 
read was Yumi-sama.  Anything she was thinking was written all 
over her face.

But what if she was wrong?

More slowly than before, Touko made her way towards her next 
destination, a thoughtful expression on her face.

***

&quot;Full house, Kings over fives.&quot;

&quot;Not so fast.  Four Queens.&quot;

&quot;Dammit.  What is it with you people?&quot;

&quot;Just strip, Katou-san.&quot;

Really, by now Touko was beyond being surprised.  She walked 
into the room and noticed it was larger than normal, set up like 
a miniature casino.  At the poker table were two people she 
recognized - the former Rosa Gigantea and Chinensis - and two 
she didn&#39;t.  One girl was wearing thick black frames, white bra 
and panties, and nothing else, having just taken off her shirt.  
The other, a serene looking girl, was wearing a complete outfit, 
and had half the chips in front of her.  The other half were in 
front of the former Chinensis, Mizuno Youko.

This meant that Satou Sei was completely naked, something that 
apparently didn&#39;t faze her at all.  &quot;Ah, it&#39;s the guest of 
honor!  Touko-chaaaaan, get over here!&quot;

Was this how it was going to end?  She&#39;d heard the rumors about 
the former Rosa Gigantea - that students who misbehaved were 
given to her for &#39;discipline&#39; and somehow were never quite the 
same.  Even after graduation, everyone knew that Satou Sei was 
the most sex-mad student to hit the school since the sixties.  
Would it end like this, with Yumi sacrificing Touko to that 
great slavering beast?  She knew she&#39;d been occasionally blunt, 
others might even say cruel, but really, this was too much.

She felt her legs move of their own accord.  Clearly her body 
had its own ideas, and was drawn to Satou Sei like a moth to a 
flame.  A bright, licking flame.

As she stood by the table Sei grabbed her by the shoulder and 
hugged her tightly.  &quot;You must be exhausted!&quot;

Touko twitched but said nothing.

Sei grinned, that dirty old man grin that defined her.  &quot;And 
you&#39;re aroused too, aren&#39;t you?  Just a little bit?  It&#39;s OK, no 
one here cares except Kei-chan, and by the end of the day she
won&#39;t care either.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to bed with you,&quot; the girl with glasses - must be 
Kei - said, chewing her lip.

&quot;Uh huh.  So how do you feel, Touko-chan?&quot;

Touko opened her mouth to tell Sei off, then shut it suddenly, 
turning red.

She was aroused.  No, forget that, she was incredibly horny.

When had that happened?  DAMMIT!  She had been so wrapped up in 
her own thoughts, how the hell had she not noticed this?

Sei grinned.  &quot;Now Touko, I want to ask you something about this 
game we&#39;re having.&quot;

Youko groaned.  &quot;Oh God, why can&#39;t you give it a rest?&quot;  Kei put 
her face in her hands.  The other girl just smiled.

&quot;Now Touko-chan.  You are the protagonist in this little 
performance.  You&#39;ve gone down the rabbit-hole, and run into all 
measure of abnormal things.  And now you come across the four of 
us, playing a game.  It all seems like a dream, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Touko said.

&quot;And keeping that in mind, what&#39;s wrong with what we&#39;re 
playing?&quot;

Touko blinked.  Her forehead started to crinkle, but then Sei 
slapped her cheek slightly, causing her to look up in shock.

&quot;Don&#39;t think about it.  What&#39;s your instinctual answer?&quot;

&quot;You should be playing mahjong,&quot; Touko said.

&quot;A ha!&quot;  Sei leaped into the air, dragging Touko along with her 
for a bit until she was able to stagger back.  &quot;I win!&quot;

&quot;Sei, we&#39;re playing poker because it&#39;s easier to strip.  We&#39;ve 
told you this over and over again.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s strip mahjong too!&quot; Sei insisted.

&quot;Only on your Neo Geo!&quot; Youko growled.  

Had they always been like this, Touko wondered.

Sei grinned, then hopped onto the table, squatting down in front 
of Kei.  &quot;Anyway, she said it.  It&#39;s not just me.  So I win.&quot;  
She closed her eyes and tried to pucker up for a kiss.  &quot;Reward 
me.&quot;

&quot;I never agreed to be your reward,&quot; Kei said, trying to back her 
chair away from the table.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to, Kei-chan.  You are my Penelope, my Juliet.  
You are the goal I strive for, the one above all others.&quot;

&quot;And what does that make me?&quot; Youko pouted.

&quot;Comic relief,&quot; Sei said sharply, before turning back to Kei, 
who was starting to look as dazed as Touko felt.  &quot;Don&#39;t deny 
the burning passion that you feel deep in your soul.&quot;

&quot;And your pants,&quot; said Shizuka, smiling.

&quot;You can go back to Italy any goddamn time,&quot; Sei said.  She was 
then interrupted by Kei reaching out, grabbing Sei&#39;s arm, and 
pulling her roughly to the carpted floor, whereupon she 
straddled her.

&quot;All right, you win.  I&#39;ve tried denying myself long enough.  
Take me, Sei!  Show me what you&#39;ve shown the others already!  
Make me yours!&quot;

Sei blinked, then grinned.  &quot;Well, since you asked...&quot;  She then 
proceeded to give her a kiss that made Touko&#39;s toes curl even 
from back over by the table.

After about a minute, the two of them came up for air.  &quot;You 
were supposed to feel embarrassed and stop,&quot; Kei murmured 
softly.

&quot;So you want me to stop?&quot; Sei said.

&quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; Kei grinned.  They then went back to kissing 
passionately.

Touko started to find Youko gently taking her arm and leading 
her to the door, pressing a card into her hand.  &quot;Knowing Sei&#39;s 
ability to unlock repression like I do, they&#39;re going to be a 
while.  And trust me, it&#39;s firsthand knowledge.  And Shizuka 
and I will be joining them soon.  So best for you to go and 
face your final boss.&quot;

&quot;Youko-san, I&#39;m sorry, but we can&#39;t have sex.&quot;

Youko blinked.  &quot;Are you unattracted to me?  Or... it&#39;s not 
jealousy, is it?  Not with Sei over there playing Kei like a 
grand piano.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing like that.  I have no doubt you&#39;d be a 
wonderful lover.  No, it&#39;s purely aesthetics.&quot;

Youko stared blankly.  Then a lightbulb turned on in her head.

&quot;Hold on one moment, I think there&#39;s something in the other 
room.&quot;  She scampered off, leaving Touko looking at Shizuka, who 
smiled right back at her.

&quot;It won&#39;t be long now.  And I have a feeling this isn&#39;t 
punishment, for what it&#39;s worth.  Though the others all seem to 
think so.  Frankly, if people say about a person that they 
should &#39;know their place&#39;, as some have said of you, I tend to 
support them anyway.  And besides, Fukuzawa&#39;s not like that.&quot;

&quot;Um... she&#39;s not like that, but she&#39;s the sort to organize a 
giant orgy under the Rose Mansion to seduce me into a sexual 
stupor?&quot;

&quot;Precisely.  The word is &#39;seduce&#39;, not force&#39;.&quot;

There was a cough, and both Shizuka and Youko turned to look at 
the unfamiliar girl who stood before them.

Except she wasn&#39;t unfamiliar, it was clearly Mizuno Youko.  She 
was just... blonde.  &quot;There was a wig that Eriko had used for a 
party in the back room.&quot;  She leaned over and gently kissed the 
side of Shizuka&#39;s neck.  &quot;Do I aesthetically please you now?  Or 
do you need me to be naive and submissive as well?  Oh, and call 
me Shimako and I won&#39;t hesitate to break a bone.&quot;

Shizuma inhaled sharply.  &quot;Goodbye, Touko-san.  Sorry we didn&#39;t 
give you tea, but I think you&#39;ll agree that this party is mad.&quot;  
And then she took Youko&#39;s hand and moved towards one of the long 
couches on the side of the wall.

Touko stared at them, then back at Sei and Kei, who were now 
completely naked.  She breathed in, and felt her nostrils flare.

She really hoped that the next room was Yumi.

***

Touko leaned against the wall, breathing heavily, and looked at 
the card.

*Behind the red door.  I&#39;m waiting for you.  Yours, Yumi.*

Touko looked up.  At the end of the corridor was a simple red 
door.  Not in the shape of a heart or anything, or even a 
biscuit like the Council room.

And behind it... what?  Touko had no idea what to think anymore.  
Shizuka said that everyone else was expecting some sort of 
punishment.  Was that what this was?  Yumi-sama, growing weary 
with Touko&#39;s blunt criticism and feigned disinterest, had 
decided to get revenge?  If so, it was a twisted sort of 
revenge.

No, even assuming that her previous views of Yumi-sama were 
wrong, this still seemed like an aberration.  Could there be 
someone else...?

Suddenly, Touko was afraid to open that door.

She knew who was behind it.

She had walked right up to it, and now rested a hand on the 
knob.  Her arousal had not gone away - in fact, it was worse - 
but there was now a healthy aspect of fear involved as well.  
She controlled her breathing, forcing herself not to start 
hyperventilating.

The knob turned, and she jumped.  It was as she&#39;d expected.  
There, on the other side, was Sachiko-oneesama.  Giving her very 
best polite smile.  Touko had based her own on Sachiko&#39;s, but it 
was clear that even as an actress, she still hadn&#39;t mastered it 
the way the older woman had.

She gestured.  &quot;Come in, Touko-chan.&quot;  Touko swallowed and 
walked inside.

The room itself was wallpapered in gold, perhaps to accentuate 
the red velvetey curtains that draped themselves across the 
center of each wall.  Another curtained area was to her right, 
but Touko only noticed it for a moment, because her eyes were 
drawn to the large table and bed on the left.

&#39;Bed&#39; was perhaps the wrong term.  It resembled nothing so much 
as the cushioned bed-table that you got medical examinations on.  
Complete with the thin white easily tearable paper.  And the 
table next to it... well, an examination might be about to take 
place, but it was unlikely to be approved by nine out of ten 
doctors.

Touko was no naive virgin.  Well, OK, she was a virgin, but she 
knew about sex.  She had read a few sexy josei-type magazines.  
And she was no stranger to getting herself off if the need 
arose.

But there, on the table, were a large assortment of instruments, 
half of which Touko did not even vaguely recognize.  She could 
guess they were sexual in nature, though, judging by the other 
half that she did.  Blindfold, gag, collar, and 3 different 
types of vibrators all lay there, clean and lined up.  Along 
with some small metal balls, a long bar with ankle restraints at 
either end, and a cat o&#39; nine tails.

It would appear that Shizuka had been incorrect.  Punishment was 
what this was clearly designed for.

The door closed with an ominous slam.  Touko turned to see that 
Sachiko had now removed her school uniform, and was dressed in a 
blood-red slip that matched the curtains so precisely that they 
looked as though they were cut from the same fabric.

Touko felt oddly disappointed.  She&#39;d expected leather.  She 
almost felt like she was outside of her own body now, watching 
dispassionately as events around her unfolded.  If Yumi&#39;s plan 
had been to desensitize her with all the sex she&#39;d witnessed 
before, it had worked.

Sachiko walked over to the table and picked up the cat, giving 
it a quick flip.  &quot;This has been in the Yamayurikai for 
generations,&quot; she said matter-of-factly.  &quot;When oneesama first 
used it on me, I had to learn its history even as I learned its 
touch.  And so did Yumi, when I introduced her to this room.&quot;  
She smiled, her eyes seeming to be far away.  &quot;That was such a 
wonderful day.&quot;  Shaking her head, she turned back towards 
Touko.

&quot;I have watched your attitude towards my petite soeur.  Your 
cold words and harsh demeanor to someone who has been reaching 
out to you.  You are too stubborn to see what is right in front 
of you!&quot;  Her voice was harsh, and Touko was taken aback.

&quot;How can you not see what Yumi has to give to you,&quot; Sachiko 
whispered.  

Then Touko understood.  Sachiko was deeply in love with Yumi in 
every way.  When someone such as Touko rejected her friendly 
overtures, it was as if they were rejecting her love.

Sachiko gestured towards the bed.  &quot;Matsudaira Touko, are you 
ready to accept the punishment that you deserve?&quot;

Swallowing, Touko stepped forward.  She wasn&#39;t sure if this was 
the right thing to do, and if it backfired, she expected there&#39;s 
be a lot of pain in her future.  But that didn&#39;t matter.  What 
mattered was, if this had to happen, then dammit, it had to 
happen in the right way.

&quot;I accept my punishment,&quot; she said, and Sachiko smiled.

Then Touko continued.  &quot;But not from you.&quot;

She squared her shoulders.  &quot;If this is a tradition that is 
passed down, then Yumi-sama should be the one showing it to me.  
And if this is because of any faults of mine that cause offense, 
then Yumi-sama is the one wronged, and should enact the 
retribution.&quot;  She licked her lips, and finally made her 
decision.

&quot;And if this is to be my first time with another... then I want 
it to be with Yumi-sama.&quot;

Sachiko frowned, not looking so much angry as just... upset.  
She moved towards Touko anyway, and Touko gently bit her lower 
lip.

&quot;Oneesama... you promised.&quot;  The voice came from the other side 
of the room, beyond a curtained four-poster bed that Touko had 
not noticed before, being too distracted by all the bondage 
equipment on the other side.

Touko found her heart beating faster.  So, Yumi-sama was here 
after all.  She found herself sweating a bit.

Sachiko turned towards the bed, looking completely unlike the 
image of the majestic ojousama she normally displayed.  In fact, 
she looked like a small child who&#39;d had their favorite toy taken 
away.  She gestured towards the implements.  &quot;But... torture!&quot;

The curtains parted, and Yumi stepped out.  Wearing nothing but 
her rosary around her neck.

&quot;Oneesama, I love you always, but this isn&#39;t your time.  It&#39;s my 
turn to create a beautiful memory.&quot;  She smiled and walked 
towards Sachiko, who let out with a major, grade-A pout.

&quot;You promised me torture!&quot;

&quot;No, I said that we might have to go that far.  It was a worst-
case scenario.&quot;  She gave Touko a brilliant smile, the sort that 
always made Touko weak in the knees even when Yumi wasn&#39;t naked.  
&quot;But we didn&#39;t, because instead, she was wonderful.  She moved 
towards Touko.  &quot;I was touched.  And I will be honored to be 
your first.&quot;

Sachiko sighed, moving to get her uniform.  &quot;I still say she 
could do with a bit of torture.&quot;

Yumi turned.  &quot;You can use them on me later in the week, if you 
like.  It&#39;s always good to reminisce.&quot;

Sachiko gave Yumi what Touko could only describe as a hungry 
look, and quietly left the room.  Leaving Touko facing her naked 
sempai.

Yumi took her unresisting hand and led her to the large covered 
bed.  Just a bed, Touko noted, not even a cuff on the bedstead 
or anything.  If Yumi was trying to be the good cop, then it was 
working like a charm.

Yumi sat down.  &quot;When I first saw this room, I think I almost 
ran out screaming.  I was terrified.&quot;  She smiled widely at 
Touko, who was still standing by the side of the bed.

Touko gestured at her uniform.  &quot;Um, should I...&quot;

&quot;Let me,&quot; said Yumi, taking a hold of Touko&#39;s cravat.  She then 
proceeded to undress Touko in a way that felt almost like sex 
itself, even though she never touched her inappropriately.  It 
was just the way that Yumi focused on Touko like she was the 
only thing in the entire world.  It made Touko feel incredible, 
and helped her to ignore her discomfort at being naked next to 
Yumi.  She ended up on the bed, almost trembling.

Yumi sat beside her, and took her in her arms, leaning back so 
they were lying facing each other.  &quot;This is a ritual that goes 
back to the founding of the school at the turn of the century.  
It wasn&#39;t always this elaborate, and usually is hidden from 
outsiders.  But the goal has always been the same.  A physical 
and emotional bond between two women, drawing them closer.&quot;

She smiled.  &quot;That&#39;s exactly how Sachiko explained it to me back 
then.  I was totally confused.&quot;

Touko blinked.  &quot;Confused?&quot;

Yumi chuckled.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong.  When Sachiko introduced me 
to the pleasures of the flesh, I was more grateful than you can 
imagine.  Not just because of the ways I found that I could give 
her pleasure, but also because I could show Sei how much she had 
meant to me before her graduation, and I could help Tsutako 
understand just what kind of relationship she could forge with 
Shouko.  Sex is wonderful,&quot; and here she whispered into Touko&#39;s 
ear, &quot;and I&#39;m very good at it.&quot;

Touko let out a small gasp, and pressed her body so that it was 
tight against Yumi&#39;s.

&quot;But we don&#39;t need any of that,&quot; Yumi continued.  &quot;Even the 
Virgin Mary, who I hope to God isn&#39;t watching all this, 
understands.  The school gave us everything we need to show our 
devotion.

Yumi reached down and picked up the cross of her rosary, then 
slipped it gently off her neck.  &quot;This rosary, given to me by 
Sachiko, means more to me than any pleasure she could give me.  
It is our faith.  The faith between two girls that they will 
pledge themselves to one another.&quot;  She breathed a long, shaky 
breath, and Touko realized that she wasn&#39;t the only one who was 
nervous.  Or aroused.

&quot;Touko, will you take this rosary?  Will you be my petite soeur?  
Will you let me guide you, help you to become the gorgeous, 
wonderful, caring woman I know you are?  Let me draw you out 
from behind your walls?  Let me show everybody that you can 
shine?&quot;

Touko had a lump in her throat now, and tears were forming in 
her eyes.  She took a few moments to respond.  Yumi was right, 
this wasn&#39;t about the sex.  It was about letting Yumi see what 
she had been hiding.  The reason for the cold glares, the blunt 
barbs.  She had to let Yumi see her wounds, the ones she so 
carefully hid even from Sachiko.

And seeing Yumi now, with a look of total conviction on her 
face, made Touko admit what she had spent months denying.  That 
Yumi was the one who could truly heal her, more than anyone 
else.

&quot;I accept,&quot; she said, barely breathing the words, &quot;Oneesama.&quot;  
She saw Yumi&#39;s shoulders fall, and knew that she had been 
incredibly tense.  And then, Yumi took the rosary&#39;s cross, put 
it between her lips, and kissed Touko, lightly putting the cross 
into her own mouth.

Touko moaned, and took the cross between her teeth, straining 
her tongue around it to try to reach Yumi&#39;s.  But Yumi had 
already pulled away slightly, and had taken the beads and put 
them over her neck, making the rosary completely hers.

And now the cross dropped down to Touko&#39;s chest, and she was 
able to kiss Yumi properly.  Yumi was the one to moan this time, 
as she took Touko&#39;s shoulders and deepened the kiss.

After a while, they broke apart once more.  &quot;I have so much to 
do, Touko.  So much I need to show you, and tell you, and--&quot;

Touko smiled, amused at Yumi&#39;s need to talk when she was excited 
or nervous.  At least she hadn&#39;t been completely wrong about 
Yumi.  &quot;It&#39;s all right.  I&#39;m not going anywhere tonight.  And 
besides,&quot; and here her glance strayed over to the table on the 
other side of the room, still unused, &quot;you haven&#39;t punished me 
properly.  You wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint your own oneesama, 
would you?&quot;

Yumi laughed.  It was a loud, raucous laugh that Touko thought 
she must have learned from Satou Sei.  &quot;If I used all that 
equipment on you after telling Sachiko it wasn&#39;t needed, she&#39;d 
throw a pout the likes of which you&#39;ve never seen.&quot;  And then 
the Sei grin faded, and it was simply Yumi&#39;s loving smile again.  
&quot;We have plenty of time for that sort of thing.  Months and 
months.  For now, all I need is Touko, unadorned.&quot;

She leaned down and captured a nipple lightly in her teeth, and 
Touko cried out.

She then turned to lie on her back, giving herself to her 
oneesama at last.

***

Sachiko sighed, flouncing up another flight of stairs.  While 
incredibly happy for Yumi, who had achieved her goal at last, 
she was still feeling very... unfulfilled.  She debated joining 
the others, but only Youko would likely make her feel anything 
but the odd one out.  And Youko was, by the sound of it, quite 
busy.

Besides, it wasn&#39;t as if she didn&#39;t have a perfectly willing 
partner.  With the added bonus of legs that went on for miles.

She opened the green baize door on the landing, and walked 
inside.

&quot;Kanako-chan.  On your knees.&quot;

Erica made me finish this.  Thank her.

Also thank the denizens of #otenba for prereading, and the Keep

a bit of an OOC issue here.  :)</pre>
