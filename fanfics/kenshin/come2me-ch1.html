<pre>&quot;Ah, Megumi-san,&quot; Kaoru smiled. She yawned and laid aside her mending.
&quot;What brings you here so late?&quot;

&quot;I was looking for Ken-san,&quot; Megumi replied. &quot;I thought I might find him 
here.&quot;

&quot;Well, he does live here,&quot; Kaoru replied irritably, not liking the 
artless tone in Megumi&#39;s voice that suggested the dojo was the last 
place she would really think to find Kenshin.

&quot;And I&#39;ve never been able to figure out why,&quot; Megumi replied cheerfully, 
sitting down near Kaoru without being invited and stretching a back 
stiff from bending over patients all day. &quot;It can&#39;t be the food; he 
could get better at a poorhouse, and do less chores for it. He&#39;s not 
teaching anyone his Hiten Mitsugiriryuu, so that&#39;s obviously not it...&quot;

Kaoru glared at her. &quot;Maybe he&#39;s just staying here because he likes good
company.&quot;

Megumi shrugged. &quot;I didn&#39;t think Yahiko was his type, but if you say 
so...&quot;

&quot;And what exactly is that supposed to mean!?!?&quot; Kaoru shrieked, sending 
Megumi into a string of oh-ho-hoing laughter.

&quot;Really, he&#39;d be better off living at the clinic,&quot; Megumi continued. 
&quot;With the way you&#39;re always beating him up, it would be healthier for 
him.&quot;

Kaoru steamed. &quot;Ano baka,&quot; she huffed. &quot;If he weren&#39;t so dense, I 
wouldn&#39;t have to beat him up so much.&quot;

&quot;He certainly doesn&#39;t seem to notice your interest in him,&quot; Megumi 
admitted.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen him getting too friendly with you either!&quot; Kaoru 
retorted.

And both young women lapsed into silence.

&quot;Ne, Megumi-san,&quot; Kaoru finally said.

&quot;Ne.&quot;

&quot;You really like Kenshin, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Megumi only nodded.

&quot;So do I.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Megumi&#39;s tone was suddenly totally serious. &quot;I think it&#39;s a 
terrible shame the way he ignores you.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;That too,&quot; Megumi laughed. &quot;He should choose one of us and get over 
with it.&quot;

Kaoru nodded emphatically. &quot;At least spare us of waiting around like 
this.&quot;

They sat silently for a bit longer. &quot;There&#39;s always Sanosuke,&quot; Megumi 
suggested, sending them both into laughter. &quot;But, seriously, 
Kaoru-san...&quot;

&quot;Ne?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you feel like we should do something to get Ken-san to realize 
how we feel?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; Kaoru jumped to her feet and slammed a fist into a palm. 
&quot;We should work together to show him that we&#39;re serious about him!&quot; She 
looked down at Megumi. &quot;But what?&quot;

Megumi stood up as well. &quot;Something that would make the waiting easier, 
and let him know that he&#39;s going to lose his chance if he doesn&#39;t act 
soon.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Make the waiting easier?&#39;&quot; Kaoru repeated.

Megumi laughed. &quot;A woman has needs, you know... and when the man she&#39;s
interested in doesn&#39;t help, she&#39;s got to look elsewhere.&quot;

Kaoru blushed deeply. &quot;You&#39;re suggesting we find prostitutes?&quot;

&quot;Why should we have to pay for it?&quot; Megumi responded after a short 
silence.

&quot;Because we two are the only ones who every have any... wait, what are 
you saying?&quot;

&quot;Kaoru...&quot;

Kaoru&#39;s head snapped around at the totally unexpected tone in Megumi&#39;s 
voice, not to mention the lack of any honorific, and she found her lips 
just centimeters from the other woman&#39;s. &quot;Kaoru,&quot; Megumi said again in 
that same tone, looking down into Kaoru&#39;s eyes with her own fiery, 
narrowed. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever just feel starved?&quot;

A rush of blood swept through the younger girl&#39;s body, and a throbbing 
picked up all of a sudden between her thighs. &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered in 
reply.

Megumi stepped closer, pressing her own taller frame slowly against 
Kaoru&#39;s as she spoke. &quot;Don&#39;t you think this would get Kenshin&#39;s 
attention?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaoru said again, and began to tremble as Megumi&#39;s lips pressed 
down onto hers. It was a soft kiss at first with little movement, but 
soon their mouths began to work as their arms slid around each other and 
the heat between them intensified. Kaoru wondered exactly how this had 
happened, despite the fact that she&#39;d been there for every word of it. 
She wasn&#39;t interested in Megumi as a lover, but everything the doctor 
had said made perfect sense, and Kaoru was quite willing to go through 
with this. She would never have admitted how many sleepless nights she&#39;d 
spent grappling with hormones and wishing Kenshin were there. This might 
prove a blessed release -- and, as Megumi had said, one `slip of the 
tongue&#39; to reveal what they&#39;d been doing, and Kenshin&#39;s attention would
certainly be procured.

Her clothes were beginning to feel cumbersome, and she squirmed in 
Megumi&#39;s strong grasp. In response, Megumi probed at her lips with a hot 
tongue, pushing her mouth farther open and drawing her own tongue out. 
The doctor&#39;s hands, formerly squeezed on her hips, now ran slowly up her 
sides, over her shoulders, and to the neckline of her shirt. Kaoru 
dropped her own arms as Megumi&#39;s hands slid under the hem. Smoothly they 
slid down her chest to cup her wrapped breasts and lift them slightly. 
Thumbs flicked upward at her tightening nipples, and she moaned as the 
throb in her crotch became more insistent. She realized that she was 
fitfully working at stripping the other woman, and was conscious of 
Megumi&#39;s panting as the long kiss finally ended.

She was pulled to the floor, her shirt completely gone. Megumi was 
kissing her shoulders now, halfway-naked herself under Kaoru&#39;s competent 
hands. The kisses moved downward as Megumi tugged insistently at the 
bandage-like wrappings Kaoru used as underwear. Just as these were 
finally dislodged and flung aside, Kaoru succeeded in sending Megumi&#39;s 
kimono to join them. She barely had time to note that Megumi wore 
European-style underwear before a moist suction began on her left nipple 
and she was sent into a spasm of slit-eyed pleasure. Her own fingers 
puzzling over the strange garments on her partner, she moaned as 
Megumi&#39;s lips parted and teeth descended gently to tug at her nipple.

&quot;Megumi...&quot; she moaned. Megumi smiled and traced a path with her mouth 
to the other breast. But her hands moved downward.

Kaoru felt a light grip on her right buttock, felt the other five 
fingers picking their way across her stomach and abdomen to slide gently 
onto her thigh and hover there. She had finally found her way into 
Megumi&#39;s underwear, and she was rewarded by a low moan from her friend 
as her hand went to work on the large breasts pressed against her belly. 
Then she tensed as Megumi&#39;s fingers dove into the curly hair foresting 
her tender area and gave her one swift stroke. &quot;Ohh,&quot; she gasped. The 
probing fingers felt slowly for the opening, and slid inside. &quot;Oohhhh,&quot; 
she gasped.

The other woman hauled herself up to kissing level again, and pushed her 
tongue into Kaoru&#39;s mouth, drawing her fingers out at the same time and 
moving them upwards ever so slightly to that one spot she knew 
instinctively would bring the most pleasure. Kaoru moaned into her mouth 
as she began a slow, rhythmic, small-arced stroking. She moved her legs 
farther apart to enhance the sensation, and scrambled to keep up her end 
of the deal by moving southward with her own attentions.

She felt the hand on her buttock clench as Megumi&#39;s warm, wet flesh 
closed around her searching fingers, and they withdrew from the kiss 
with single accord in order to pay more attention to their efforts. 
Closing the distance between their upper bodies, Megumi laid her head on 
Kaoru&#39;s shoulder and clenched her teeth. Kaoru stroked faster, though a 
strange paralysis seemed to be fighting for control of her hand. She 
clenched muscles somewhere in her lower half, waiting for that moment of 
release. And she stroked Megumi faster.

Suddenly Megumi stiffened, gave a strangled cry, and buried her face in 
the soft flesh beneath Kaoru&#39;s shoulder blade. She began to tremble, all 
tension draining out of her body after that first spinal arch. &quot;Oi,&quot; 
Kaoru protested in annoyance as the stroking stopped. She poked the 
shaking woman in her arms. &quot;Oi! What about me?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Megumi whispered, pulling back up to her knees. Then she 
smiled, the wide-eyed look on her face one of the most interesting 
things Kaoru had ever seen. &quot;But it&#39;ll be better this way.&quot; She pressed 
a hand to each of Kaoru&#39;s thighs, pushing them as far apart as they 
would go. With gentle thumbs she separated the soft flesh between, 
exposing Kaoru&#39;s gem to the cool air of the room.

Kaoru&#39;s eyes widened as Megumi&#39;s head dipped. The sudden wet pressure 
was almost more than she could bear, and when she suction started she 
let out a long, long moan. Then Megumi&#39;s tongue flicked out and pressed 
against her in a long, hard stroke.

A massive, explosive orgasm spread through her like ball lightening, 
breaking from the contact point under Megumi&#39;s tongue and touching 
every part of her body. She arched her back, stretching her legs and 
clenching at Megumi&#39;s hair in convulsive pleasure.

Megumi laid herself down next to her friend and put her arms around her. 
&quot;You wish,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Wish what?&quot; Kaoru moaned faintly.

&quot;You just called out Kenshin&#39;s name,&quot; Megumi replied teasingly.

Kaoru slid her own arms around the other woman&#39;s torso and leaned her 
head onto Megumi&#39;s chest. &quot;Did I?&quot;

Megumi was prevented from answering by a voice from outside. They both
stiffened, expecting the door to open. Instead they only heard the sound 
of something sliding down it and bumping to the ground, as if someone 
had sat abruptly with the shouji as support. &quot;That was the strangest 
thing I have ever seen, de gozaru.&quot;

Neither had noticed his presence, but it seemed he&#39;d entered at some 
point and seen them. They looked at each other, amusement and triumph 
their mutual emotion. Someone else sat down against the door, and 
Kenshin&#39;s voice was joined by another, deeper one.

&quot;Fuck, yeah.&quot;

The two friends hugged each other tighter, exhausted, and started to 
laugh.
