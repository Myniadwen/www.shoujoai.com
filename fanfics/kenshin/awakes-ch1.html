<h1>Awakenings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kenshin/index.html">Rurouni Kenshin</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuri.html">Yuri</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Misao, I brought a yakuta for you, for when you get out of the tub,&quot; 
called Megumi. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you bring it in, and talk to me while I soak, 
Megumi-sensai?&quot; 

Megumi paused in the door of the dimly lit bathroom, momentarily 
startled by her own reaction to the sight of Misao&#39;s lithe young body 
only partially concealed by the shadowy water surrounding her. She was 
surprised at her own response to the girl. After all, she was a grown 
woman now, and a doctor as well. 

[It&#39;s just that she looks so much like Kadiri. I can&#39;t remember how 
many times I saw her relaxing in the tub like this. I can&#39;t remember 
how many times I JOINED her in a cool tub on nights like this one...] 

Ruthlessly she pushed the thought away. She wasn&#39;t sixteen anymore, 
and Misao wasn&#39;t Kadiri. Besides, as a physician, she&#39;d been exposed 
to the human body enough to be in the presence of a naked woman in a 
bathtub without embarrassment. 

[But it&#39;s not exactly embarrassment I&#39;m feeling...] 

Megumi entered the room, and perched on the edge of the tub. Misao had 
been so lost in relaxation that she hadn&#39;t even noticed Megumi&#39;s 
hesitation at her invitation to come and talk. 

&quot;Are you feeling better now, Misao?&quot; she questioned gently. 

Opening her eyes and pushing herself up out of the water enough to 
rest her arms on the side of the tub, Misao nodded in response to 
Megumi&#39;s question. 

&quot;Hai, Megumi-sensai.&quot; 

&quot;Just &#39;Megumi&#39; please, Misao. We are friends now, aren&#39;t we?&quot; 

&quot;Hai, Megumi! I hope that we can be even closer friends. I just want 
to thank you for rescuing me tonight. I love everyone at the Kamiya 
Dojo, but I think I was at the breaking point. If Yahiko had called me 
&#39;Weasel-girl&#39; one more time, he would have been sprouting kunai like 
flowers,&quot; she threatened, losing some of the calm she had just 
attained. 

&quot;Shhh...don&#39;t even think about it. Don&#39;t think of anything at all 
right now. Just lay there and relax. The last few months have been 
very stressful for us all. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all need time to return to 
our normal selves.&quot; 

The thought of Sano intruded, and Megumi wondered if she even knew 
what normal would be. A sudden frown marred her face, and looking up, 
she found Misao wearing exactly the same frown. In a moment of perfect 
understanding both girls were overcome with giggles. 

&quot;Normal?!?&quot; 

&quot;Sano?!?&quot; 

&quot;Aoshi-sama?!?&quot; 

But after only a moment, Misao&#39;s giggles evaporated as suddenly as 
they had come, and her eyes regained the haunted look they&#39;d carried 
for so long. Megumi sighed as she realized where Misao&#39;s thoughts had 
taken her. 

[Damn Shinomori!! Doesn&#39;t he see what he&#39;s doing to this girl? And 
doesn&#39;t he care? I can&#39;t understand why she would want him, but she 
does. When is he going to accept her love?] 

&quot;Megumi, what am I going to do about Aoshi-sama? He doesn&#39;t even see 
me when I&#39;m standing right in front of him!!&quot; 

Megumi tried to control her exasperation, but didn&#39;t quite succeed. 
&quot;Well, first of all, you could quit calling him &#39;-sama.&#39; That should 
get his attention. After that, it depends on what you want from him.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;Well, how do you WANT him to see you? Do you want to be acknowledged 
as the little sister he&#39;s always known, the new Okashira, or simply as 
a woman, instead of a child?&quot; 

&quot;As a woman!! Everyone still treats me like a child! I&#39;m not a child! 
Does a child look like this?&quot; she demanded as she suddenly levered 
herself out of the water to stand before Megumi. 

As the water cascaded from her gleaming body, Megumi swallowed past a 
suddenly dry throat. She studied the girl who stood before her, knee 
deep in water with her hands on her hips, angrily demanding a 
response. Her eyes traveled up the slender yet muscular legs, across 
the flat stomach and lingered for a moment on the full breasts 
displayed before her. A stray draft caused the flame on the lamp to 
shift, before caressing Misao&#39;s skin. As Megumi watched, the girl&#39;s 
nipples tightened in responseto the breeze, and she felt an answering 
tension in her own body. 

Holding Misao&#39;s still-defiant eyes for a moment Megumi rose and 
circled behind her with an intriguing smile on her face. With deft 
hands she loosened Misao&#39;s hair from it&#39;s long braid and gently combed 
her fingers through it. The thought assailed her again. 

[So much like Kadiri.] 

She wistfully recalled the special friend with whom she had explored 
her own blossoming womanhood. Kadiri had possessed this same long 
flowing blue-black hair. Always thicker and livelier than Megumi&#39;s 
own, she&#39;d also had to restrain it for control. The eyes were nearly 
the same, as was the height of the two girls. Kadiri had always loved 
to lay her head on Megumi&#39;s bosom when they had hugged. It had been 
their own secret signal of shared affection. 

Megumi&#39;s thoughts returned to the present, and to the girl standing 
before her. How would Misao react? Better to find out now if she was 
really ready to be a woman, rather than have her panicking one day 
soon in Shinomori&#39;s arms. Returning to the side of the tub, she 
extended a hand to help Misao step from the water. Although a bit 
confused by Megumi&#39;s continued silence, Misao accepted her hand. To 
her surprise, instead of moving away as she stepped out onto the floor 
Megumi moved closer, so that the points of Misao&#39;s breasts were 
brushing just below her own. 

Twining together the fingers of their still joined hands, Megumi 
raised her other hand to Misao&#39;s chin. Lifting hr face, Megumi 
questioned, &quot;Are you really ready to be a woman, or would you rather 
remain a little girl for a while longer?&quot; She brushed her thumb across 
Misao&#39;s lips to stop her next words, then replaced the thumb with her 
warm lips. As she gently kissed the younger girl, Megumi smiled 
inwardly at the shock on Misao&#39;s face. Abruptly releasing her, Megumi 
walked to the other side of the room to pick up the yakuta she had 
come in with. 

&quot;If you say you are ready to be a woman, and to know Shinomori&#39;s body, 
you must first know your own. If you aren&#39;t ready for this, or don&#39;t 
want it, come and take this yakuta, and we will simply go to sleep and 
forget the whole thing. You may remain a child a bit longer, if that 
is your wish.&quot; 

Misao intently studied the figure across the room. Shadowy and strange 
in the uncertain light, Megumi suddenly seemed to be only a beautiful 
stranger. Self-consciously her arms raised to cross before her 
breasts, her earlier bravado suddenly disappearing. Catching the 
derisive smirk on the other girl&#39;s face, she immediately dropped her 
arms, and straightened her body proudly. 

[Damn her!! She&#39;s trying to scare me into remaining a 
child...unknowing... Well, I&#39;ve got news for her!! I feel a lot of 
emotions right now, and maybe I am a little scared, but I AM a woman! 
And maybe it&#39;s time to show it...] 

With an easy grace, she strode across the floor to stand before her 
gentle tormentor. As she took the yakuta from Megumi&#39;s hand, she felt 
a moment&#39;s fierce satisfaction at the disappointment in her eyes. 
Draping the garment over her arm, she met Megumi&#39;s eyes with a wicked 
grin. 

&quot;I think we&#39;d be more comfortable on the futon, ne?&quot; 

Standing alone in the bedroom, Misao felt assurance giving way to 
uncertainty. 

[Where is she? Did I do something wrong? Maybe I&#39;m not ready for 
this...but I think I am. But WHERE is she?] 

Misao&#39;s chaotic thoughts were interrupted by the soft sound of the 
door sliding closed behind her. Spinning around, she was met by the 
sight of Megumi, dressed only in a loosely tied robe, with a wooden 
comb and a small porcelain bottle in her hands. Obeying a wordless 
gesture, she sank gracefully to her knees on the cushion before 
Megumi&#39;s dressing table. As Megumi began to comb Misao&#39;s hair, their 
eyes met in the mirror, and Megumi smiled. 

&quot;Relax, Misao. I&#39;m not going to do anything you don&#39;t want to do, nor 
am I going to ask you to do anything in return. This comb is made of 
sandalwood. It has a wonderful fragrance, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... yes, it&#39;s wonderful,&quot; mummered Misao as the rhythmic stroking 
of the comb in her hair did it&#39;s intended job in relaxing her. 

&quot;Misao,&quot; whispered Megumi. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Come and lay down on the futon.&quot; 

As she led a suddenly tense Misao to the bed, she thought, &quot;It begins 
already...this alteration between tension and release. Soon she&#39;ll 
find out how pleasurable it can be...&quot; 

&quot;Lie down on your stomach, Misao,&quot; she instructed. 

&quot;On my stomach?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. I have some body oil that I would like for you to share with me. 
I&#39;ll start in the back.&quot; Megumi held up the porcelain bottle. 

&quot;Oh. All right.&quot; 

[That doesn&#39;t sound so scary. In fact, it sounds quite nice...] 

&quot;Aahhh...&quot; 

Megumi smiled at the sound of pleasure Misao made as she rubbed the 
light oil into the muscles of her calves. As she worked her way up 
Misao&#39;&#39;s legs she moved from beside her to above her. At first Misao 
tensed as one of Megumi&#39;s knees separated her legs, but she quickly 
relaxed as Megumi simply continued to kneed the muscles on the sides 
and back of her thighs. 

Suddenly she gasped as Megumi reached between her legs to firmly cup 
her sex and give a single gentle swipe of her hand up and back between 
Misao&#39;s buttocks. On the second stroke, Megumi&#39;s fingers gently parted 
her to rub softly across her inner lips, and up again, ending with one 
finger trailing across tightly clenched muscles and continuing up her 
spine. She felt fabric brush across her calves, and then Megumi&#39;s 
breasts crushed firmly against her back. Dimly she realized that 
Megumi had removed her robe and their naked bodies were tightly 
pressed together. 

&quot;That didn&#39;t hurt, did it, Misao?&quot; 

&quot;N....no, Megumi.&quot; 

With a laugh, Megumi raised herself again to her knees and continued 
her massage. As she continued on Misao&#39;s buttocks and back, she felt 
the girl begin to relax again. Moving Misao&#39;s hair to one side, she 
took her time on her back, caressing each muscle into relaxation, 
before continuing down each arm to give it the same treatment. Finally 
she stretched out on top of Misao, exactly mirroring her position. She 
hooked her chin over Misao&#39;s shoulder placing her mouth very close to 
Misao&#39;s ear. 

&quot;All relaxed now,&quot; she breathed softly. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; was the breathless reply. 

&quot;Good. Then turn over, and let&#39;s do the front side...&quot; 

[The FRONT side!?! Oh!! Ahhh....] 

All coherent thought ceased as Megumi began to gently caress Misao&#39;s 
ear with her tongue. As she sucked softly on her earlobe, Misao 
allowed Megumi to shift her position and roll her pliant body over. 
Megumi&#39;s mouth left a trail of kisses across her face, before settling 
her lips firmly on Misao&#39;s. 

As she parted Misao&#39;s lips with the tip of her tongue, she was 
pleasantly surprised at the ardent response she received. Withdrawing 
her tongue, she allowed Misao to take charge of the kiss. As Misao&#39;s 
tongue slid questioningly into Megumi&#39;s mouth, she gasped as Megumi 
stroked it with her own. 

Presently Megumi lifted her head to stare down at the girl, whose 
heavy breathing matched her own. 

[Such passion!! I certainly hope Shinomori appreciates what he&#39;s 
getting!] 

Gently disentangling herself from Misao&#39;s arms, she repositioned 
herself at the girl&#39;s feet to continue the massage. Megumi&#39;s graceful 
fingers trailed up Misao&#39;s legs. As her palms slid up Misao&#39;s thighs, 
she felt the muscles start to tense. Ignoring the obvious invitation 
at the juncture of Misao&#39;s thighs, she pressed a firm hand low on her 
abdomen, just above the soft black hair growing there. 

At Misao&#39;s gasp, she mummered, &quot;You feel it....right there, don&#39;t you, 
Misao?&quot; 

&quot;Megumi....Megumi...!! What??&quot; 

&quot;Shhhh...you&#39;ll see...&quot; 

Using the full palms of her hands, she rubbed up the sides of Misao&#39;s 
body to stop just below her breasts. Leaning forward, she allowed the 
tips of her own breasts to brush teasingly again the taunt nipples 
below her. Misao arched her back to press their bodies more closely 
together, but Megumi straightened away from her. Watching Misao&#39;s 
face, she waited until the blue eyes opened before sliding both hands 
up to cup her breasts and squeeze lightly. With satisfaction, she 
watched those same blue eyes darken with pleasure before bending to 
take an aching nipple in her mouth. Misao moaned with pleasure. Megumi 
rolled the hardened nipple between her lips, before drawing it into 
her mouth. As she suckled deeply, Misao gave a deep groan of pleasure. 
Transferring to the other breast, Megumi gave it the same treatment. 

As Megumi lavished pleasure on the girls breasts, she was startled 
when Misao suddenly pushed her away. With a graceful twitch of her 
hips, Misao scooted lower on the futon, bringing her sex firmly 
against the knee between her legs. Then, wrapping her arms around 
Megumi&#39;s back, she pulled her forward, taking one of the older girl&#39;s 
breasts deeply into her mouth and flicking the nipple with her tongue. 
Megumi leaned into Misao&#39;s body to deepen the contact, and in doing 
so, rubbed her thigh against the sensitive nerve endings between the 
girl&#39;s legs. 

Misao whimpered when Megumi moved her knee to straddle her hips, but 
her mouth never relinquished hold of Megumi&#39;s breasts. As she licked 
and sucked, Megumi ground her sex against Misao&#39;s pubic bone. Megumi 
knew what she needed, and all it took was a few twists of her hips, 
before Megumi cried out her release. 

Throwing her hair back out of her eyes, she smiled down at the 
startled Misao. 

&quot;You don&#39;t even know what just happened, do you, Misao?&quot; 

&quot;No...Megumi...did I hurt you? You cried out...&quot; 

&quot;So will you, in just a few moments. And then you&#39;ll see that it was 
pleasure and not pain that gave voice to my cry.&quot; 

Gently she pushed Misao back onto the futon, and began a hot path of 
kisses down her body. She settled herself between Misao&#39;s updrawn 
knees, and parted her with a careful hand. She ran a questing finger 
over the moist lips displayed before her. From the corner of her eye, 
she saw Misao&#39;s hands clench in the sheets. Placing her thumb on 
Misao&#39;s clitoris, she softly stroked in a circular motion, gradually 
touching the girl more firmly as she became more and more aroused. 
Misao gasped, and reached for Megumi&#39;s hands, before aborting the 
gesture to drop her own back to the sheets. 

&quot;Do you want me to stop?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; was the choked reply, and Misao&#39;s head tossed on the cushion. 

Megumi bent and replaced her thumb with her tongue, eliciting a cry 
from Misao. Making a point of her tongue, she circled Misao&#39;s clitoris 
several times before dipping to plunge deeply into her. Removing her 
tongue, she very carefully inserted one slender finger, stopping just 
short of the barrier she found there. 

[No. Let her come as a virgin to Shinomori&#39;s bed. That way he can 
never question her past...] 

Withdrawing her finger, she returned her mouth to Misao and resumed 
the rhythmic stroking of her tongue that she knew would bring her 
release. Misao&#39;s cries turned to whimpers as she pleaded, although she 
wasn&#39;t sure what she was begging for. 

&quot;Please...please...please...&quot; 

Sudden movement caught Megumi&#39;s eyes and she watched as Misao&#39;s hands 
stroked up her own body to cover her breasts. She ground her hips 
against Megumi&#39;s mouth as she rolled her hardened nipples between her 
fingers. Finally, she came in a great shining rush, screaming Megumi&#39;s 
name. As the shudders passed, she pressed her palms hard against her 
aching nipples, and asked the only coherent question in her mind. 

&quot;Can I do that to you?!?&quot; 

The tinkle of Megumi&#39;s silvery laughter echoed through the night. 

~*~

Shinomori Aoshi arrived from Kyoto early the next morning, finding the 
girls giggling as they combed each other&#39;s hair. Misao quickly 
finished dressing and prepared to leave with her Aoshi-sama. Just 
inside the doorway Misao paused, as Aoshi waited for her outside. 
Impulsively she threw her arms around Megumi in an enthusiastic hug. 
Megumi was touched when Misao laid her head for just a moment on the 
taller girl&#39;s bosom, and cuddled her close. 

As Megumi returned the tight embrace, Misao whispered, &quot;Thank you, 
Megumi. Thank you for everything. I won&#39;t forget what you&#39;ve taught 
me.&quot; 

Looking up, Megumi encountered Aoshi&#39;s inquiring gaze. As she answered 
with only an enigmatic smile, Megumi caught an answering glimmer in 
his eyes. 

[He knows!! But how? I wonder what he&#39;ll do?] 

His words were not what she expected. 

&quot;Thank you, Megumi-sensai.&quot; 

A deep bow was her only acknowledgment of his calm statement. As she 
watched the couple stroll away, Misao chatting up a storm, and Aoshi 
silent as a rock, Megumi had an amusing thought. 

[I&#39;ve delivered babies before, but that was the first time I&#39;ve 
delivered a woman into this world. Not bad, for a first effort.] 

Her foxy laughter rang out through the hot summer morning. It was 
definitely going to be a wonderful day!!
