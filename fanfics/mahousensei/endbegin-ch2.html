<h1>Endings and Beginnings (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/endbegin-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Collet Rallendoll watched with some surprise as the two warriors 
appeared in the transportation gate for the city state of Ariadne, the 
largest independent educational establishment in Mundus Magicus, 
yielding to no outside authority. It&#39;s Mage-Knights were legendary as 
were all the great magicians and scholars they turned out.

&#39;The mercenaries are younger than I was expecting,&#39; Collet noted, the 
brown skinned girl hurrying over to greet them. The taller girl had 
raven black hair and wore light weight armor, a impressive looking 
katana over her shoulder, while the other woman wore more heavier armor, 
chain mail and a heavy armor on her left arm.

&quot;Welcome to Ariadne,&quot; Collet smiled at the two of them, her black and 
white dog&#39;s ears sticking out from her brown hair, &quot;I&#39;m your guide, 
Collet.&quot;

The orange haired girl looked at her in surprise, &quot;Collet... you&#39;re 
Yue&#39;s friend?&quot;

&quot;You know Yue?&quot; Collet looked startled. Yue Ayase after being 
accidentally stranded in their word had landed in Ariadne and enrolled 
in the school, becoming Collet&#39;s room mate and partner for a while. She 
had been faintly astonished at the girl&#39;s hunger for knowledge, not to 
mention her magical abilities.

&quot;She&#39;s a friend of ours,&quot; the serious looking black haired woman said, 
&quot;my name is Setsuna Sakurazaki, and this is Asuna Kagurazaka.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s our classmate,&quot; ASuna agreed, offering her hand to be shaken.

&quot;How is she?&quot; Collet asked eagerly as she escorted the two woman along 
the elevated walkway over the bustling city. Magicians flew back and 
forth and the streets teemed with life, much like Mahora academy did but 
to a even greater extent.

&quot;Still studying whatever interests her,&quot; Asuna chuckled, &quot;especially 
magic. She&#39;s even moved on to become a official apprentice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Collet grinned as they made their way inside, heading down 
the halls towards the headmistress&#39; office.

Naoko Konoe was not quite what Setsuna or Asuna were expecting, Collet 
noted with some amusement. The young seeming woman&#39;s beauty stunned 
Setsuna while Asuna&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.

&quot;Konoka?!&quot; Asuna blurted.

Naoko shook her head, looking amused. &quot;No, but I understand I look like 
my niece,&quot; she said, &quot;my name is Naoko, and I understand that you know 
my father, the headmaster of Mahora academy?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Setsuna stammered as she tried not to stare at the woman 
who looked like an older, somewhat sexier version of Konoka.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Asuna looked sheepish, &quot;you just look so much like...&quot;

Naoko just chuckled slightly. The black haired woman rose from behind 
her desk, her simple blouse and robe like dress swirling around her as 
she said briskly, &quot;Thank you for answering our appeal for help so 
quickly.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re honored to help,&quot; Setsuna managed.

Collet nodded to both as she looked at the headmistress, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I need 
to get back to class. Unless you need me for something more?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Naoko said, &quot;I&#39;ll call you if needed.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for your help,&quot; Asuna added. Looking over at Naoko she asked in 
a businesslike way, &quot;So, what is the situation?&quot;

Naoko smiled wryly, &quot;It&#39;s not that unusual. It seems bandits have been 
preying on students and guests traveling to our city, and we need them 
stopped.&quot;

Setsuna shook off her confused daze and tried to concentrate on 
business. &quot;How is that possible?&quot; she wondered, &quot;I would have expected 
your mage knights to stop them.&quot;

Naoko opened her hands in a helpless gesture as she explained, &quot;The 
problem has been finding them. They&#39;re using a powerful cloaking magic, 
and our best seers have been unable to find them.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Asuna nodded, frowning slightly.

Setsuna frowned as well, then a smile began to appear on her face. She 
looked over at Asuna, &quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;

As the sun began to set later that day, a small band of travelers set 
out from the city of Ariadne, wrapped in cloaks and riding on a lizard 
drawn wagon. Two sat in front, the taller holding the reins, while a 
third woman crouched in the back, apparently ill.

They took a hour to cross the plain around the city, then began to rise 
into the hills as the sun fell behind the trees. Unconcerned with any 
danger they continued along the main road, seemingly unaware they were 
being shadowed. They passed between two rises, the perfect place for a 
ambush, and it was there the bandits struck!

&quot;Stop right where you are,&quot; a tall, dark haired figure emerged from the 
shadows, dressed in battered leather armor. Around him over twenty other 
armed men followed, carrying swords, maces and other weapons.

Another man dressed in mage clothes pulled a slightly ragged cloak 
around him as he addressed their leader, &quot;I&#39;ve got us shielded from 
detection, &#39;Hawke. Take whatever time you need.&quot;

&quot;Ren?&quot; the wagon driver sat up in surprise, her cloak falling away as 
Naoko said, &quot;I knew you were up to no good when you were expelled, but 
this?!&quot;

&quot;You know this woman?&quot; &#39;Hawke demanded, noting his companion had gone 
bone pale.

&quot;Tha... that&#39;s the headmistress of Ariadne!&quot; Ran blurted.

Setsuna stood up from where she sat by Naoko, &quot;She&#39;s not alone, curs.&quot;

Asuna stood up in back, her massive artifact sword swinging free from 
the blanket she had used to hide it. &quot;I&#39;ll go after the mage,&quot; she said 
to Setsuna softly, &quot;while you can start in on the bandits, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Setsuna grinned as she drew her sword and charged in, embracing 
battle as a distraction to her heartbreak.

&quot;Rose rose rose,&quot; Ran rapidly incanted the spell, &quot;five arrows of 
thunder!&quot; With a gesture he sent the five lightning bolts lancing at 
Asuna, only to freeze as she slapped them aside with her massive sword.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Asuna said as she turned her sword and brought the flat of her 
blade down on top of his head, &quot;magic doesn&#39;t work on me.&quot;

&quot;Stone cutting sword!&quot; Setsuna roared as she tore into the stunned 
bandits, sending some flying as the others raced forward to fight or ran 
away.

&quot;My oh my,&quot; Naoko murmured in admiration as she gestured skyward, 
sending a bolt of magic into the night sky.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of here,&quot; &#39;Hawke yelped as Ran dropped 
unconscious.

&quot;Why?&quot; a black clad woman wondered, watching Setsuna eagerly.

&#39;Hawke gave her a disgusted look, &quot;I can bet you the Headmistress just 
called in help. We&#39;ve got to subdue these girls and get away, fast.&quot;

Asuna let go of her sword, the weapon floating in midair as she smirked, 
&quot;Easier said than done. She cupped each hand, &quot;Ki in one hand, magic in 
the other. Bring them together...&quot; As she did so Asuna seemed to explode 
with power, taking up her sword and attacking with inhuman speed.

&quot;The kankaho technique?!&quot; Naoko murmured as Asuna began to tear into the 
bandits with a speed that matched Setsuna&#39;s, &quot;I wonder if she&#39;d agree to 
be studied...&quot;

As the bandits tried to rally the mage knights swept in on their brooms, 
Collet leading the charge. &quot;Surrender now,&quot; she yelled as she and her 
fellow students readied spells, &quot;or prepare for the consequences!&quot;

Pretty quickly things evolved into a rout, the bandits hideously 
outmatched by the schoolgirls and their allies. Once the bandits 
surrendered the mages bound them up and hauled them back to the city, 
leaving Setsuna, Asuna and Naoko to make their leisurely way back.

&quot;Thank you for driving the wagon,&quot; Setsuna said quietly as they rode 
back to town.

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault you two don&#39;t know how,&quot; Naoko said, smiling 
slightly. She winked, &quot;Can I take the wagonering fee out of your 
reward?&quot;

Asuna laughed, &quot;Maybe so.&quot;

&#39;This isn&#39;t my Konoka,&#39; Setsuna had to remind herself as they saw the 
happy students waiting to greet the heroes, &#39;no matter how much she 
looks like her...&#39;

To be continued...

manga. Collet, however, is a character from the later chapters of the 
manga series.
