<h1>Quiet Morning (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sticky.html">Sticky the Dog</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     Setsuna was surprised by the speed with which everyone cleared out 
of the room after Negi and Asuna left. Granted, it was apparent that 
Negi was the reason they&#39;d come to the room in the first place, but 
Setsuna figured that they would want to at least stay and enjoy Konoka&#39;s 
hospitality. It seemed mean that they would leave as soon as the &quot;Guest 
of Honor&quot; was not available to be fondled like some toy. Setsuna walked 
in and looked across the room to see Konoka beginning to clean. Despite 
only staying for a few minutes, the other girls had managed to create 
quite a mess.

       &quot;I&#39;m sorry about everyone else, Ojou-Sama,&quot; Setsuna began, 
nervously as usual, &quot;I&#39;m sure you were looking forward to a quieter 
morning. I&#39;ll leave if you want me to.&quot;

       &quot;Oh no, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Konoka replied in her usual cheery manner, 
&quot;I&#39;ll just finish cleaning up here, and then I&#39;ll make us some 
breakfast. You and I can have a nice, quiet morning.&quot; She smiled happily 
and returned to her tidying up,

       Setsuna sighed. She knew she would enjoy breakfast with Konoka, 
but once again she felt that they were becoming still too close. They 
had already grown together a lot on the school trip, and if things 
continued along in this fashion, she wouldn&#39;t be able to protect Konoka 
from the shadows, as had been her original intention. &quot;But,&quot; Setsuna 
thought to herself, &quot;Would that really be as bad as I keep telling 
myself it would?&quot; She thought back to some of the things Asuna had said 
on the trip to Kyoto, talking about how Konoka really enjoyed spending 
time with her. And, truth be told, Setsuna enjoyed spending time with 
Konoka as well.

       Konoka gathered up a few of Negi&#39;s things that had wound up on 
the lower floor. She climbed up to Negi&#39;s loft and placed them on his 
desk; he would have to sort them later himself. Konoka looked at the 
desk, and noticed a box of small chocolates. &quot;Well, maybe just one,&quot; she 
thought to herself, and popped one into her mouth. It tasted somewhat 
like a mix of chocolate, cherries, and strawberries. &quot;Mmm,&quot; Konoka 
savored it as it melted in her mouth.

       Konoka climbed down the ladder from the loft. &quot;Okay Set-Chan, 
I&#39;ll make us some breakfast now. What would you like?&quot; Konoka turned to 
look at Setsuna. Almost immediately, her face flushed. Somehow, Setsuna 
looked different than she had before. She seemed radiant, almost like 
she was glowing. The light from the &quot;glow&quot; warmed what Konoka could only 
call her heart. She glanced away, still blushing.

       Setsuna, not really noticing the change in Konoka&#39;s demeanor, 
thought to herself for a moment, then replied to Konoka&#39;s inquiry, &quot;I 
think eggs, toast, and some tea will be just fine thanks. If it&#39;s not 
too much trouble,&quot; Setsuna looked away nervously. She disliked asking 
too much of anyone, especially someone like Konoka.

       Konoka walked towards Setsuna. For some reason, she just felt 
that she had to be closer to her. She leaned in, putting her face very 
close to Setsuna&#39;s, and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s no trouble at all! You shouldn&#39;t 
worry so much, Set-Chan!&quot;

       Setsuna blushed as Konoka walked into the kitchen, humming to 
herself. Why had Konoka gotten so close like that? She had almost felt 
the warmth from her face. True, there had been an air of pleasantness to 
it, but it was still uncomfortable, in an unfamiliar way.

       &quot;Oh no!&quot; Konoka cried out from the kitchen. Setsuna&#39;s alarms 
immediately went off, and she ran into the kitchen with her sword, ready 
to do battle with whatever was threatening Konoka. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
Ojou-Sama! I will protect you!&quot;

       Konoka gave Setsuna a puzzled look. &quot;Protect me from what? I was 
just sad because we&#39;re all out of tea.&quot;

       Setsuna turned to look at Konoka, a look of embarrassment and  
confusion on her face. &quot;B-but, you sounded so terrified?&quot;

       Konoka&#39;s face now wore a look of sadness. She looked away and 
poked her fingers together nervously. &quot;Well, I was just worried that 
since I can&#39;t make you a proper breakfast, you might leave!&quot; She 
returned her gaze to Setsuna, who could see tears beginning to well up 
in Konoka&#39;s eyes. Setsuna blushed again, and desperately tried to 
comfort her, her arms hovering nervously around Konoka&#39;s quivering 
frame.

       &quot;Leave? Just because there&#39;s no tea, I wouldn&#39;t leave you here by 
yourself. I...enjoy spending time with you...&quot; Setsuna was quite taken 
aback by what she heard herself say. True, she did enjoy spending time 
with Konoka, but until now, she had refrained from telling her, knowing 
that it could only lead to more uncomfortable closeness. However, in 
this case, there was just something about the look in Konoka&#39;s eyes that 
had made Setsuna tell her how she felt.

       Konoka wiped the now-halted tears out of her eyes, and looked at 
Setsuna with a renewed sense of relief visible on her face. She sighed 
happily, then leapt forward and wrapped her arms around Setsuna, hugging 
her closely.

       Setsuna froze, a look of shock crossing her face, not that Konoka 
could see it. Konoka had always been a very close person, but she had 
never actually hugged Setsuna. Slowly, and nervously, Setsuna lowered 
her hands and placed them gently around Konoka&#39;s back. At this, Konoka 
squeezed Setsuna tightly. This went on for several minutes. As they 
embraced, Setsuna felt a faint kind of electricity flowing around them, 
connecting them more than they even appeared to be. &quot;What is this 
feeling?&quot; Setsuna asked herself. It was similar to the feeling she had 
had when she was flying through the stars, carrying Konoka to safety. It 
was a gentle, familiar feeling.

       Upon Setsuna returning her embrace, Konoka had felt amazingly 
satisfied, as if this was what she had wanted for a long time now. She 
couldn&#39;t understand why it had taken so long for her to make it happen. 
It felt so right to hug Setsuna this way, almost as if they were made 
for each other. She was happy that Setsuna hadn&#39;t left.

       Gradually, Setsuna pulled herself completely out of the embrace, 
holding onto Konoka&#39;s shoulders and looking her in the eye. For the most 
part, anyway. As she spoke, she blushed and looked away momentarily a 
lot. &quot;Well...um, would you like to...er, that is, to have breakfast...or 
we could, you know, just...talk?&quot; Setsuna flushed even more, sweating as 
she spoke. Why was she getting so worked up over a simple hug? &quot;You 
know...we could just...sit and talk...for a while?&quot;

       &quot;Oh Set-Chan!&quot; Konoka cheered happily as she lunged forward 
again, only this time, her head did not go past Setsuna&#39;s as it had for 
the hug.

       Setsuna&#39;s eyes widened. Her heart rate quickened, and fluttered. 
Her mind froze reeling from the shock of being kissed by Konoka. And not 
the shock of a peck on the cheek, nor the shock of a quick open-lipped 
kiss. This was quite a different story.

       Setsuna could feel Konoka&#39;s tongue.

       Setsuna tried to say, &quot;Ojou-Sama, what are you doing?!&quot; but of 
course it only came out, &quot;Mmf-Mmf, mmf mmf mmf?!&quot; Despite her shock, 
however, she did not try to push Konoka away. Instead, she closed her 
eyes and took it in. Konoka&#39;s tongue was not only in Setsuna&#39;s mouth, it 
was moving around. Setsuna allowed her own tongue to move in and join 
it. They stood in the kitchen that way for several minutes, their lips 
locked, kissing like that. As shocking as the situation was, Setsuna 
would not deny that she enjoyed what was happening. It was pleasant, 
doing this with Konoka. It made her feel warm inside, and the 
electricity that had flowed around them when they hugged was even more 
prevalent here.

       Konoka, who had initiated the kiss, was instantly glad that she 
had. Again, this felt amazingly right. She thought back to all the times 
she had desperately asked Setsuna to spend time with her. Konoka knew in 
her heart that this was why she had wanted to be with her; it had all 
led up to this moment. She kept her eyes closed and her tongue moving, 
hoping that this moment would never end.

       It did end, of course. Slowly, reluctantly, their lips parted, 
both of them panting. Her arms still wrapped around Setsuna, Konoka 
gazed into her eyes, and said aloud the one thought that was dominating 
her consciousness.

       &quot;Set-Chan, I love you.&quot; She blushed, and smiled softly. She was 
so happy that she had gotten that thought out. Right now, it was the 
most important thing in the world to her. It had been, ever since she 
had seen Setsuna this morning. By saying it, she felt that she had 
accomplished some monumental goal.

       Setsuna, upon hearing this, gasped lowly. She felt faint. Still 
embracing Konoka, she fell back against a wall of the kitchen and slid 
down slowly. Konoka came with her, their eyes locked together. &quot;Love?&quot; 
Setsuna thought to herself, &quot;Ojou-Sama...loves me?&quot; Setsuna&#39;s mind 
simply couldn&#39;t get past this idea. All that had transpired in the last 
few minutes was obvious proof, as was Konoka&#39;s behavior at other times, 
especially during the trip to Kyoto. Somehow, however, actually hearing 
Konoka say it made it seem so unbelievable.

       Setsuna was now lying against the lower wall, with Konoka sitting 
on her, legs splayed across her lap; they stared into each other&#145;s eyes. 
Konoka moved her face in, and the two kissed again. Their hands came 
together, and their fingers laced themselves together. Setsuna moaned 
softly. Their lips parted, and Setsuna studied Konoka&#39;s face, and the 
look she wore which truly conveyed love, and Setsuna knew what she had 
to say.

       &quot;Ojou-Sama...I...love you too...&quot; It was true. It was the reason 
Setsuna had always so desperately wanted to protect Konoka. It was why 
Setsuna was so nervous around her. And it was why Setsuna had initially 
been so evasive of her. She knew that she had these feelings for Konoka, 
but she had never imagined that that feeling could be returned. Saddened 
by this thought, she had resigned herself to keeping Konoka safe from 
the shadows, her love remaining a secret she would never tell. Until 
now, that is. Now that she knew that Konoka really did share her love.

       Now it was Setsuna&#39;s turn to initiate a kiss. This one lasted the 
longest, both of them pouring all their love into one another. When they 
finally parted, both of them panting heavily, Konoka did not pull away 
completely. She moved slowly downward, and softly pressed her lips to 
Setsuna&#39;s neck. Setsuna closed her eyes and persisted in her heavy 
breathing, her entire body tingling with excitement.

       Konoka released Setsuna&#39;s neck and continued along down her. Now, 
she stopped at the upper part of her chest. Feeling Konoka&#39;s lips on her 
body like this made quiver with pleasure. Her mouth still working its 
way around Setsuna&#39;s upper body, Konoka slid Setsuna&#39;s shirt and bra up 
as far as they would go, revealing her breasts. They were somewhat 
small, but round, well shaped. Konoka placed the tip of her tongue on 
the hardened nipple of Setsuna&#39;s right breast, and began teasing it. 
Setsuna let out a quick, sharp moan. There was a tickling sensation, but 
it was hardly unpleasant. After a few minutes of this, Konoka placed her 
entire mouth on Setsuna&#39;s breast, her tongue still working. Setsuna 
brought her right hand up and began gently stroking Konoka&#39;s head, and 
used her other hand to massage her left breast. She gritted her teeth 
momentarily as her body tensed from all the excitement, then let out a 
loud moan. &quot;Oh...Ojou-Sama...&quot; She panted softly.

       Despite her joy in being with Konoka like this, during all this 
there was a voice in Setsuna&#39;s head, telling her that this was not quite 
right. Konoka was a very affectionate person, true, but she had never 
been this forward. Setsuna tried to explain it away by telling herself 
that it was because Konoka had been waiting for her, but even then 
Setsuna knew that this was quite outside Konoka&#39;s normal realm of 
behavior. Of course, Setsuna did nothing to stop Konoka and question her 
on this matter, but the thought was there, all the same.

       Konoka was actually just as unsure about this as Setsuna. Right 
now, Konoka new that she loved Setsuna, and doing this with her was what 
she wanted. However, it felt like this urge had appeared out of nowhere, 
like an unseen force had given her feelings for Setsuna a push in this 
direction. She disliked this uncertainty, and decided that her feelings 
needed to be solidified even more.

       Konoka removed her mouth from Setsuna&#39;s breast; her tongue 
extended with a thin thread of saliva still connecting it to her nipple. 
She slowly moved back up Setsuna&#39;s body. She took her right hand and 
placed it on Setsuna&#39;s left, which was still rubbing her breast. When 
her head was once again at the same level as Setsuna&#39;s, their lips met. 
&quot;How could I have doubted these feelings?&quot; Konoka thought to herself, 
&quot;This feels too wonderful for me to be uncertain.&quot;

       Her lips still wrapped around Setsuna&#39;s, her right hand still 
partnered with Setsuna&#39;s left, Konoka&#39;s left hand slid down the center 
of Setsuna&#39;s body, slowing as it came to her stomach. It hovered above 
the outside of Setsuna&#39;s skirt for a moment, until she brought it around 
to the inside of it. Konoka placed her hand on the outside of Setsuna&#39;s 
panties and began massaging slowly.

       Setsuna&#39;s body exploded with tension. Still locked with Konoka&#39;s 
lips, a long moan escaped from where their mouths were joined. She 
plunged her tongue deeper into Konoka&#39;s mouth, all of her senses 
drowning in passion.

      After several minutes, Konoka withdrew her face from Setsuna&#39;s. 
Both girls where breathing in short hard puffs. Still petting the 
outside of her panties, Konoka stared at Setsuna&#39;s face, as Setsuna 
stared at hers. Konoka began descending ever so slowly, her eyes still 
transfixed on Setsuna&#39;s blushing, panting face. As she continued 
downward, she withdrew her right hand from Setsuna&#39;s breast, and kept 
moving until she was at eye-level with Setsuna&#39;s panties. Placing her 
hands on the inside of Setsuna&#39;s legs, Konoka softly kissed Setsuna&#39;s 
right thigh. She withdrew after a few moments, then moved her hands 
slowly inward until they were holding the top of Setsuna&#39;s panties. 
Completely focused, she rolled them downward, down her legs until they 
were just above her knees.

       Of all the new feelings Setsuna had experienced today, the 
feeling of Konoka&#39;s hot breath on her slit was the most surprising. A 
warming sensation, concentrated into short, hard puffs; Setsuna could 
not see Konoka&#39;s face clearly, but she could feel her emotions. She 
could feel herself sweating all over as the heat swelled up and over 
her. Droplets appeared across her body, joining the ones that had 
already formed up to this point. She panted faster and faster, holding 
onto this moment, and then Konoka plunged into her.

       It was one of the fastest motions Konoka had made during this 
entire exchange. Before she fully knew what she was doing, her face 
rushed forward, and her tongue extended itself into Setsuna. Konoka 
closed her eyes and began moving her tongue; in and out, up and down. 
Setsuna&#39;s slit was already quite wet from all of the previous 
stimulation, and now it grew more moist by the second. As she did this, 
Konoka brought her right hand down, and began rubbing herself. Setsuna, 
feeling a rush like never before, once again brought her left hand up to 
massage her breast, and placed her right hand on the coursing form of 
Konoka&#39;s head. Small tears welled up in the corners of her eyes, and she 
let out quick, sharp moans, in time with the extensions and retractions 
of Konoka&#39;s tongue.

       The moisture around Konoka&#39;s tongue continued to grow. She moved 
her tongue faster, and did the same with her right hand, which was now 
completely inside her panties. Moving faster, more vigorously, Konoka 
was suddenly stopped, as she felt the inside of Setsuna explode with 
moisture. She felt all of the tension that had been accumulating in 
Setsuna&#39;s body relax away, as she let out one great sigh. Konoka pulled 
away from Setsuna&#39;s crotch, and moved back up to her face, where the two 
girls kissed one more time, Konoka&#39;s mouth filled with Setsuna&#39;s juices. 
As she had rubbed herself, Konoka had finally pulled her pants down, 
panties and all, and now the centers of their legs crossed together. 
Feeling their bare skin on each other, kissing with all this moisture 
between them, and now being as relaxed as they were, the couple wished 
that they could just fall asleep here, and stay like this forever. 
Though of course, it could not last that long, they did fall asleep like 
that, together in the kitchen.

       As they slept, Konoka dreamed of Setsuna, and Setsuna dreamed of 
Konoka. In the back of their dreams, however, the lingering doubt about 
what had just happened remained. Setsuna was ecstatic that she had been 
able to be with Konoka like this, but she still knew that this was far 
removed from Konoka&#39;s usual behavior. She thought about asking Konoka 
what prompted her to do this, but she decided that she might save that 
question for another time. Konoka herself was also aware that this was 
not how she usually acted, despite how right it felt now. It seemed like 
ever since she had first seen Setsuna this morning, all the dormant 
feeling she had harbored for her had decided to come out. She was glad 
that they had, no matter how sudden and forced it may seem. She laid on 
top of Setsuna&#39;s body, her head resting between her breasts, a content 
smile on her face.

       The sound of approaching footsteps caused both girls to awake at 
the same time. Setsuna, still embracing Konoka, slid back up the kitchen 
wall, and they both listened.

       They heard the voice of Negi, &quot;...You feed the chocolates to the 
target, and whoever they first see, they fall in love with.&quot;

       &quot;L-love potion...?&quot; They heard Asuna say.

       &quot;Sorry not to tell you sooner,&quot; Negi replied. A commotion between 
him and Asuna erupted outside the door.

       Their arms still wrapped around each other, Setsuna and Konoka&#39;s 
eyes met. &quot;Love potion?&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;You...so is that why...?&quot;

       Konoka blushed and looked away, &quot;Well, I did eat one of the 
chocolates, but I know that all this wasn&#39;t just because of that.&quot; Now 
she had tears welling up in her eyes, just like earlier in the morning. 
&quot;I do love you, Set-Chan! I always have! I just...got a little help...I 
guess...&quot;

       Setsuna, still reeling somewhat from this truth coming out, 
peered even deeper into Konoka&#39;s eyes. True, maybe some of it was the 
magic talking, but Setsuna could see love, not just in Konoka&#39;s eyes, 
but in the tears she had. &quot;I know,&quot; she reassured, &quot;I love you too, 
Ojou-Sama.&quot;

       They glanced at each other, and the condition that they were in. 
Konoka blushed even more, &quot;If Negi...and Asuna...they will...&quot;

       Setsuna instantly understood, and pulled her shirt back down, and 
her panties back up. Konoka pulled her pants up. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll just, you 
know, be going now,&quot; Setsuna said, rushed and embarrassed. She hated to 
end their meeting in a rush like this. However, she knew that she had to 
be seen as the Setsuna that Negi and Asuna knew, who didn&#39;t like 
spending too much time with Konoka.

       Konoka watched Setsuna walk towards the door, and for the first 
time, felt what she knew to be the love potion&#39;s effect. Her body raced 
towards Setsuna, and tackled her to the ground, just as Negi and Asuna 
walked through the door. Their mouths were agape as they walked in to 
see Setsuna, on the floor, being fondled by Konoka. &quot;I love you, 
Set-Chan!&quot; Konoka cried, &quot;Loooove yooouu!&quot;

       Though she was more or less feigning desperation to get out of 
the situation, Setsuna took comfort in knowing that what Konoka was 
saying was true, and that she felt the same way.

The End? Of this story maybe...

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES: Truth be told, it was only after I wrote this that I 
found out that KonoSetsu was such a popular pairing. I mean, I can see 
why, but I never really suspected that so many people would think along 
the same lines.

       Anyway, basically how this whole thing got started was, I read 
the first chapter of Negima Volume 7, and this whole idea of what 
happened *before* Negi and Asuna walked in just kinda got stuck in my 
head. I would have LOVED to draw it, but alas, my art skills art quite 
up to a snuff of THAT caliber. So I did the next best thing: I wrote a 
lemon.</pre>
