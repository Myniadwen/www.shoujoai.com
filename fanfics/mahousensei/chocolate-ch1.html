<h1>The Chocolate (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hayabusa.html">HayabusaCena</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a good sunny day at the Mahora Academy. To make things better for 
the female students, it was the end of the class. The Class 3-A teacher 
Negi and several of his students had left their classroom. However, 
there were eight students who decided to stay there and clean their 
room. Yue and Nodoka swept the floor while Natsumi and Chizuru wiped the 
glass windows with rags. Asuna, Ayaka, Konoka and Setsuna were standing 
near the teacher&#39;s desk. Konoka and Setsuna were waiting for Ayaka to 
give them their task.

&quot;Konoka, Setsuna, you two will buy some school materials for our class.&quot; 
Ayaka said as she gives them a shopping list.

Konoka takes the list before looking at it. &quot;Hmm..., well this shouldn&#39;t 
be hard. These materials are easy to find.&quot; She accepted with her cute 
smile.

&quot;Good. Here&#39;s the money for your shopping, girls.&quot; Ayaka smiled back at 
her before giving the money to Setsuna. &quot;You girls may leave.&quot;

The lovers left the classroom just as the class representative had said. 
As Ayaka looked around the classroom, she noticed Asuna sleeping on her 
desk, which the orange-haired girl does rarely, and much to the class 
rep&#39;s chagrin.

&quot;Why that little monkey!&quot; She thought angrily, glaring dead at her 
nemesis. It was obvious that she didn&#39;t like to see her doing absolutely 
nothing, especially in this kind of situation. She approached her with 
an exasperated look. &quot;Hey wake up, Sleeping Beauty!&quot; she shouted at her, 
not long before slapping her back.

&quot;Hmm...Oh it&#39;s you class rep.&quot; Asuna muttered drowsily as she slowly 
looks at Ayaka, feeling only a little pain from the slap. Her view was 
blurry, so she blinked several times.

&quot;Well Asuna, instead of just sleeping all day, why don&#39;t you do me 
favor.&quot; Ayaka retorted, not pleased at all.

&quot;What is it? Want me to knock you out?&quot; Asuna taunted before she yawned 
directly at her.

That last statement really got the blonde-haired woman irate. Asuna was 
getting on her nerve. However, Ayaka had a devious plan that would make 
Asuna lose her smirk. &quot;Very funny. Now I want you to buy all of the 
items listed here.&quot;

Asuna reluctantly took the list, obviously didn&#39;t want to do her orders. 
But after looking at it, she had lost her smirk and found the list 
ridiculous. &quot;What the, are you kidding me?! You want me to buy these 
make-ups, dresses, gowns, and other stuffs just for you?&quot; She complained 
as her drowsiness faded quickly. She stood up, then her rival with a 
fuming look.

Ayaka was very happy to see Asuna not wearing her smirk anymore. It was 
her time to smirk. &quot;Ah what&#39;s the matter Asuna? You don&#39;t want to take 
this task?&quot; she said ironically, placing her left hand on the left side 
of her face.

Ayaka was getting on Asuna&#39;s nerve but only a little. &quot;You are dead 
right that I don&#39;t want to take this. Only a pedophilic maniac would 
make this task.&quot; Asuna barked, glaring daggers at the other woman. 
Everyone around them was startled by Asuna as they stopped cleaning for 
few seconds and then continue.

Ayaka was feeling a bit embarrassed since everyone was looking at them. 
&quot;Oh really, so you don&#39;t want to this task?&quot; Regardless of the 
situation, Ayaka smiled deviously at her, and it seemed that everything 
was going the way she wanted.&quot;Yup. I&#39;m not going to do this for you. Why 
don&#39;t you just buy them yourself?&quot; Asuna finalized her words as she 
looked away from her, crossing her arms.

&quot;Um... Ayaka...&quot; Nodoka hesitantly approached Ayaka. She didn&#39;t want to 
get in their conversation but there was something she would like to ask 
to the class rep. &quot;Can we leave the classroom now? We&#39;re done cleaning 
the entire room.&quot;

Before Ayaka could confirm, she looked around the seemingly spotless 
classroom and it was clean enough for her. &quot;Alright, you girls may 
leave.&quot;

Asuna attempted to get out of the room while Ayaka was looking at the 
other girls by jumping out of the window but her stupid senseless plan 
ended quickly. &quot;And just where the heck are you going, you monkey?&quot;

Asuna simply rolled her mind as a reply, not minding her name-calling. 
She went back to her, getting bored. &#39;Thank goodness those girls left. I 
don&#39;t want to ruin our little secret.&#39;

&quot;Now where was I?&quot; Ayaka placed her right hand under her chin and rubbed 
it, trying to recall what Asuna had previously said to her. &quot;Oh yeah. 
You said to me that you wouldn&#39;t do the task I gave to you earlier. Well 
then, I guess I have no choice but to tell something to 
Takahata-sensei.&quot;

That &#39;something&#39; startled Asuna as her head snapped right to Ayaka. She 
was curious to know what it was. &quot;Wait, what do you mean by 
&#39;something&#39;?&quot; She asked with anticipation.

&quot;Ah you want to know. Well do I have to remind you about our little 
secret?&quot; Ayaka uttered sarcastically, couldn&#39;t believe that her friend 
had forgotten it.

As Asuna&#39;s memory surged her correctly, she remembered that little 
secret but as she got deeper, she began to realize what Ayaka was trying 
to say. &quot;Yeah I... No wait a minute. Don&#39;t tell me that...&quot; She 
completely figured out the consequence if she ever refused to do the 
task.

&quot;That&#39;s right Asuna. If you refuse to do this, I will tell 
Takahata-sensei that you broke his most valuable vase!&quot; Ayaka cut 
Asuna&#39;s sentence off, knowing that she realized everything.

The younger woman glared at the older one with great intense anger. 
&quot;Ayaka... Don&#39;t you dare go that far!&quot; She retorted, gritting her teeth.

&quot;Take it easy. I won&#39;t be that far. I know that you didn&#39;t intentionally 
break his vase. But if you reject this, then I guess I have to tell him. 
In fact, he hasn&#39;t found out who broke it. Oh yeah and have you 
forgotten about your promise?&quot;

Asuna recalled it as well, and she didn&#39;t like recalling it again. 
&quot;Yeah, I remember and we made a deal...&quot;

&quot;That if you don&#39;t do everything I say to you, I will let him know.&quot; 
Ayaka completed the sentence for her.

Asuna had no choice. She loved her former teacher but she didn&#39;t have 
the courage to face him and tell everything. She feared that Takahata 
would become upset to her if he found out. She slowly lowered her anger 
and calmed herself down. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll do everything you say. Just please 
don&#39;t tell it to anyone else.&quot; She said unwillingly, looking away from 
Ayaka. Luckily, no one was around them listening. She finally decided to 
obey Ayaka, instead of getting humiliated by her.

&quot;That&#39;s a good girl. You better bring them here at my dorm room before 
sunset or I won&#39;t think twice...&quot; Ayaka added a stipulation before she 
was cut off mid-sentence.

&quot;Okay, okay. I&#39;ll bring them.&quot; As she made her way out of the room, she 
heard her stomach growling. &#39;Oh great. Now I&#39;m hungry. As if being 
forced by that blondie to do everything she says to me isn&#39;t bad enough. 
Better find something to eat first.&#39; She grumbled.

In front of her, she saw a red heart-shaped chocolate box, filled with 
heart-shaped chocolate of course, on Negi&#39;s desk. She picked one of the 
delicious chocolates and ate it. However, after she chewed it, she could 
feel a strange sensation inside her. &#39;What&#39;s...What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; 
She said. She felt a bit dizzy.

Ayaka noticed that Asuna is feeling a bit strange. &quot;Hey Asuna, are you 
alright?&quot; She inquired, starting to get worried about her rival-friend.

The orange-haired girl turned around and looked at the older woman. The 
sensation she was feeling began to build up. After staring at the 
blonde-haired woman for long, her sensation turned into affection. Asuna 
started to realize to how beautiful Ayaka is. However, deep down inside, 
she struggled to fight it off. She always thought that Ayaka was just 
her friend and at the same time, her rival. But something was forcing 
her to be fallen in love with Ayaka. As Asuna kept looking at Ayaka, her 
cheeks turned tomato red. &quot;Hey Asuna, is there something wrong?&quot; Ayaka 
inquired again, comprehending that there was something was not normal 
with Asuna. She approached her a bit, with her mouth and body quivering.

&quot;Oh yes, I&#39;m alright darling.&quot; Asuna replied in an uncharacteristically 
manner, looking at Ayaka lovingly. She gazed her right in her emerald 
eyes and she found them very gorgeous. She couldn&#39;t help but looked at 
her and her eyes. Yet, a part of her self was trying to wrestle this 
unwanted fondness. &#39;Wait... Why am I looking at Ayaka like this? I... I 
can&#39;t control myself!&#39; Asuna was about to lose control of herself.

Asuna&#39;s affectionate words made Ayaka freak out as she backed away from 
her. She blinked twice, not believing what she had heard. &quot;What did you 
just say?&quot; She raised one of her eyebrows, revolted after hearing Asuna 
calling her &#39;darling&#39;.

Asuna continued flirting Ayaka, albeit she still struggled to stop 
yearning Ayaka. &quot;And my! You are sooooo cute!&quot;

&quot;Hey Asuna, are you trying to make a lame excuse just so you can&#39;t do 
your duty?&quot; Ayaka barked, trying to snap Asuna back to her senses.

Asuna managed to snap herself out of her &#39;undesired affection&#39; towards 
Ayaka and shuddered, thanks to Ayaka&#39;s yell. She shook her head before 
looking back at her, her blush dissipated. &quot;Oh! Uhm sorry, Ayaka. I&#39;m 
gonna go now.&quot; Asuna had set her mind on her duty for now and she 
hurriedly left the room.

&quot;What&#39;s with her calling me her darling?! Disgusting!&quot; Ayaka mentally 
said with disgust in her mind as she crossed her arms. However, 
something inside her seemed to like it and appreciated it. &#39;Darling. 
That was so sweet of her.&#39; Ayaka shook her head vigorously, trying to 
forget what she was thinking. It seems that a part of her had affection 
towards Asuna. &quot;Why am I thinking that? I don&#39;t love her. We&#39;re just 
friends and rivals. That&#39;s all.&quot;

As Asuna walked in the hallway, her &#39;undesired affection&#39; came back 
inside her and because of this, she thought about Ayaka. Of course, she 
again struggled to fight it off. &quot;I... I can&#39;t be thinking of Ayaka 
again! I... I...&quot; Suddenly, a realization popped up in her brain. &quot;Could 
it be that darn chocolate? Don&#39;t tell me that chocolate that I had eaten 
had... had a spell!&quot; Indeed, the chocolate had a spell on it; a magical 
spell that would anyone fall in love with the first person they saw 
after eating the spell-contained chocolate. Asuna tried to kick it out 
but the spell was too much to overcome. Therefore, her mind was 
dramatically overcame by it and now, she thought of Ayaka again, only 
this time with great fondness and lost control of herself. She had lost 
the battle. &quot;Ayaka-chan, she is such a wonderful person. I shall do 
everything she tells me, in order to get her... love.&quot;

XXXOOOXXXOOOXXXOOOXXX

Ayaka went to her dorm room at around 2 p.m. After entering into her 
room, she noticed that there was no presence of either Chizuru or 
Natsumi. Apparently, they were outside having fun with the other girls. 
Ayaka placed her bag on her sofa and sat down next to it. She 
contemplated about the quietness of her room. She thought about the 
happenings that transpired earlier. She reminded herself of Asuna. 
&quot;What&#39;s with Asuna earlier? She was acting a bit strange. Calling me her 
darling is so unusual of her. Why the heck did she call me that? Could 
it be that she...&quot; Ayaka immediately stop herself from finishing it by 
shaking her head vigorously again. &quot;Why am I thinking that again? That 
word maybe sweet it&#39;s just simply a word!&quot;

&#39;Oh Ayaka. Why do you reject the fact that Asuna called you darling? 
Don&#39;t you see that she loves you? And have you forgotten that she said 
that you were so cute?&#39; A part of her spoke unexpectedly in her mind, 
trying to make Ayaka think fondly of Asuna.

&quot;What are you talking about? I don&#39;t care what feelings Asuna have for 
me, whether they are sweet or hurtful. I don&#39;t love Asuna! I just...&quot; 
Ayaka tried to protest to herself but she couldn&#39;t able to find the 
words that would defend her.

&#39;I just what? You said yourself that you and Asuna-chan are friends and 
rivals, right? Do you know the old expression that goes &#39;The more you 
hate, the more you love&#39;?&#39;

&quot;What has that something to do?&quot;

&quot;Ah c&#39;mon, class rep. You and Asuna-chan have such a fondly love-hate 
relationship. You two have been on a lot of fights and arguments while 
growing up and as you two were fighting and arguing, you loved every 
second of it. You two have formed a great rivalry but at the same time, 
you two have formed a good friendship as well. As friends, you girls 
started to care for each other and had fun together. Even though you and 
Asuna had been fighting for more than one occasion, you girls managed to 
get along on some difficult situations and always there for one another 
whenever situation calls for it. Oh yeah and what about the time when 
she consoled you when you lost your baby brother? You still remember 
that, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Ayaka brought that time into her mind. &quot;Yeah, I remember that when Asuna 
was there. She was so caring to me and she comforted me when I was on an 
extreme depression.&quot;

She remembered when her father told her that her baby brother died and 
she couldn&#39;t believe it. That horrible tragedy haunted her and she 
couldn&#39;t do anything but kept quiet. That&#39;s when Asuna came to her and 
tried to comfort her, but in an unusual way. Asuna teased her a bit, 
calling her a crybaby. Ayaka got irritated by that name-call and chased 
her around the mansion, which is her home. As she chased her, her smile 
began to form and she had forgotten about her brother&#39;s death. She 
enjoyed chasing Asuna and she felt happiness coming back to her.

&#39;I glad that you still able to recall that. And now, after everything 
you had with Asuna, after having a great relationship with her, you&#39;re 
saying that you don&#39;t love Asuna-chan at all?&#39;

Ayaka had to admit that the voice she was hearing in her head was right. 
She did care about and love Asuna. Everything that the voice had said to 
her was a fact and there was no denying it. &quot;I guess you were right 
about everything. Asuna and I are not just rivals but friends as well. I 
do care about Asuna and I do...&quot; Suddenly, she paused as a thought 
occurred in her mind. She contemplated this for few seconds. &quot;Hey wait a 
minute! Are you trying to make me fall in love with her?&quot;

The voice was surprised to hear that. She just simply smiled. &#39;You can 
say that but you should know that everything I told you is the truth. 
And the reason why I asked you about how you feel about Asuna is not 
because I want you to be in love with her. It&#39;s because that you seem to 
have a crush on her.&#39;

Ayaka was absolutely shocked when she heard that. She would ever imagine 
about herself having a crush on her. &quot;A crush on her?! Are you kidding 
me?! Why would I have a crush on her? We&#39;re both girls you know!&quot; She 
said vehemently, a red tint was formed on each of her cheeks.

The voice thought of this as an excuse, sensing that Ayaka was trying to 
forget all about everything that she had said to her but the voice 
wasn&#39;t going to give up. She thought of Ayaka&#39;s last statement as a very 
lame excuse and it wasn&#39;t enough to make her convince. &#39;So what if you 
two are both girls. Please, your gender isn&#39;t an excuse. I can feel that 
deep down inside your precious heart, not only you love her but you are 
IN love with her.&#39; She disapproved her excuse with a grin, thinking it 
as a lame and dull excuse.

Still Ayaka wasn&#39;t going to give as she brought another excuse and this 
time, she believed that this will make the voice inside of her consider 
without a doubt. &quot;Okay, I admit. I do love Asuna.&quot;

The voice gladly smiled at her, now waiting for her to say that she was 
in love with her.

&quot;But have you forgotten about Negi-sensei? I love him more than Asuna 
and I&#39;m deeply in love with him and not that orange-haired monkey!&quot; 
Ayaka continued and eagerly expected that the voice would be dumbfounded 
enough to give up and accept that fact. No doubt that she got a point 
there.

Unfortunately for Ayaka, the voice wasn&#39;t going to accept her defense 
yet despite what Ayaka had said regarding Negi was a fact. &quot;You are 
absolutely right Ayaka-chan. No doubt about it.&quot; She admitted it but 
wasn&#39;t going to lay it down yet.

&quot;You darn right I&#39;m right. And haven&#39;t you seen my collections of Negi 
merchandise all over my room?&quot; Ayaka sarcastically replied as she 
crossed her arms.

&quot;You&#39;re undoubtedly right again Ayaka-chan. I guess you&#39;re in love 
Negi-sensei and not Asuna-chan.&quot; She was about to admit all of the facts 
the 3-A class representative had said to her but still, not yet. &quot;Well I 
guess I have to accept everything you said. But um...&quot; But before she 
could throw another fact of her own to Ayaka, three knocks on the door 
were heard.

The voice inside of Ayaka&#39;s mind faded away. Ayaka stood up and before 
she could move, she had two expectations: one, there could be two girls 
behind the door who are her roommates Chizuru and Natsumi and two, it 
could be Asuna behind the door who could be carrying all of the items 
she was ordered to buy by her. Ayaka walked towards the door and held 
the door knob. She opened the door and one of her expectations happened 
but she was amazed at the same time. She saw Asuna carrying two shopping 
bags filled with many of the required items inside each of them. Not 
only that, but there were more and numerous shopping bags around her, 
about ten of them. Ayaka was speechless and had a blank expression on 
her face while Asuna took this as a happy expression and just smiled at 
her. Ayaka was anticipating that Asuna would bring all of the listed 
items to her but she wasn&#39;t expecting that she would bring her all 
listed items with a great number on each of them. There was a short 
silence at the moment.

Asuna decided to speak first. &quot;Well, I bought and brought all of the 
things you needed, Ayaka-chan.&quot; She said with a cute smile. Ayaka was 
snapped out of her blank condition when she heard Asuna calling her 
&#39;Ayaka-chan&#39;. &quot;Why thank you Asuna. I appreciate all of this.&quot; That was 
all she could say before she lifted two shopping bags in front of her 
and carried them to her room.

Once all of the bags were in her room, she looked at what was inside one 
of the bags and saw a dress in it. She pulled it out, raised it to her 
shoulder level and when she looked at it, she was astonished, much to 
Asuna&#39;s delight. Asuna was standing near Ayaka and just simply smiled at 
her when she saw her friend&#39;s amazement. In her mind, Ayaka wondered if 
her own jade-colored eyes were deceiving her. She witnessed an 
expensive, very beautiful red ball gown with a very luxurious fabric and 
with golden pearl and sequin trimmings. Ayaka couldn&#39;t find the right 
words for her comment about the dress and she was entirely speechless 
for a moment. She couldn&#39;t help but just stared at it with great 
astonishment.

&quot;Well, what do you have to say about the dress I bought to you?&quot; Asuna 
cheerfully asked, curiously wanting to know Ayaka&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Asuna... I... I... don&#39;t know... what to say. This dress is so lovely.&quot; 
Ayaka finally spoke but couldn&#39;t get her statement straight due to her 
extreme astonishment. It took her few seconds to get herself out of it 
and put the dress down on her sofa. She resumed looking at the bags and 
this time, she was very cautious to pull out everything from the bags. 
She thought that everything Asuna had bought were very precious, 
valuable, and expensive. Every time Ayaka pulled out a bought stuff from 
a bag, she was astonished and amazed. Asuna helped her pull everything 
from the bags and showed them to her. During Ayaka&#39;s inspection, she saw 
everything that was on the list from manicures, make-ups, and cosmetics 
to gowns, dresses, and everything she wanted. After the examination, she 
and Asuna replaced them back to the bags and move them to the side of 
the room. Exhausted and tired from all that, the two sat down on the 
sofa and took a deep breath, Asuna moved Ayaka&#39;s bag to the side of the 
sofa&#39;s arm. She moved closer to the still exhausted Ayaka.</pre>
