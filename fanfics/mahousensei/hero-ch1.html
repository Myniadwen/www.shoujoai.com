<h1>Hero (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ayaka Yukihiro had two kinds on nightmares, neither
pleasant. The one kind involved her little brother,
imagining her parents bringing home the lifeless body
and her childlike attempts to bring him to life. Her
adult self knew it was useless, but she still
continued to try. 

The other kind of bad dream involved running.

Ayaka raced across the nightmare scenery, her long
blonde hair swirling around her as she ran. Lightning
flashed across the night sky, illuminating the
twisted, dying trees and rough, stone covered ground.

&quot;Negi,&quot; Ayaka cried out, hoping that the dream would
follow a familiar pattern as the monsters began to
catch up with her, &quot;Negi-sensei!&quot;

Suddenly a blurred figure raced by her, charging
towards the demons then there was a bright flash of
light. Stopping and spinning around Ayaka breathed a
sigh of relief, the creatures fallen in a pile as the
shadowy figure turned towards her. 

&quot;Oh Negi, I....&quot; Ayaka started only to trail off as
she realized the other person was carrying a massive
sword, NOT the staff Negi did.

Firelight from the battle lit up the figure as it
neared walked up to Ayaka and she soon realized it was
a woman, dressed like some knight in a fairy tale. A
steel breastplate gleamed brightly with the Mahora
crest as a cloak fluttered about, a short skirt
allowing free movement as she strode across the fire
lit landscape. Her red-orange hair swirled around her
gracefully and a small smile teased her lips. Ayaka
knew her well, even in such a strange place, and she
was not pleased to see her.

&quot;Asuna, what are YOU doing in my dream?!&quot; Ayaka
protested irritably, &quot;It&#39;s bad enough I was chased by
monsters but not being saved by Negi-sensei spoils the
whole thing!&quot;

Asuna didn&#39;t answer Ayaka but her blue and green blue
eyes showed warm amusement as she drew close. The
sword, a massive weapon nearly as tall as she was
disappeared once Asuna let it go, much like her armor
also faded away revealing their usual school uniform
underneath.

Still silent Asuna reached out to touch Ayaka&#39;s
cheek, a soft gesture entirely at odds with her usual
brash nature. &quot;What...?&quot; Ayeka began.

A soft finger was pressed to Ayaka&#39;s lips and oddly
she found herself seemingly frozen, gazing at Asuna as
she put her hands on Ayaka&#39;s shoulders. In a single
smooth motion she bent forward, pressing their lips
together in a lingering kiss. Ayaka wanted to fight
but a rush of warmth seemed to sap her strength
away....

&quot;AAAAAH!&quot; Ayaka cried out in alarm as she jerked up
in bed, her heart pounding and eyes wide. 

One of the many servants in her mansion entered,
obviously used to her mistresses&#39; morning cry. &quot;Are
you all right milady?&quot; she asked politely.

&quot;Damn that Asuna,&quot; she angrily muttered as Ayaka
flung back her bedding, &quot;it&#39;s bad enough I have to
deal with her in school, but must she invade my dreams
as well?&quot;

&quot;Would you like breakfast on the patio, madam?&quot; the
maid asked as she laid out a dressing gown for Ayaka.

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Ayaka got up, feeling how sticky with
sweat her nightie was. In a few moments she was
sitting out on the balcony, looking out over the
gardens as she tried to wrestle with the remnants of
the dream&#39;s images in her mind. 

Having Asuna of all people rescue her! It was absurd.
Yes, Asuna was very physically capable and she did
have her harisen, the paper fan which she used in
combat, and she had also heard that it could transform
into a sword but.... 

&quot;Arrgh,&quot; Ayaka made a incoherent noise. 

And that kiss! It was so rude it was nearly
impossible to describe. Yes, it must have been pure
rtevulsion that froze her when Ayaka kissed her, and
horror that made her knees weak. The sweet summery
scent that came from Asuna, reminding her of the
outdoors was so crass and primative, unlike Negi.

Then suddenly, Ayaka felt her indignation collapse
like a house of cards. &#39;I dreamed that Asuna kissed
me,&#39; she realized, &#39;and I liked it!&#39;

&quot;You&#39;re breakfast, madam,&quot; a male servant arrived,
pushing the tray. &quot;Will you be going out later?&quot; he
asked respectfully.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ayaka admitted glumly, then she
groaned as another thought occured to her. &#39;They&#39;re
all coming over today,&#39; she mentally whimpered.

Meanwhile, a tired young women returned to her rooms,
her red-orange hair flowing in twin streams, the bell
designed hair clips ringing softly as she moved.
&quot;Morning Konoka.&quot; she smiled at her sleepy roommates,
&quot;morning Negi.&quot;

&quot;Morning, Asuna-san,&quot; Negi smiled, the young boy as
chipper as always. &quot;Already went to deliver your
papers?&quot; he asked. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Asuna agreed, &quot;all done.&quot; 

&quot;Do you know if we&#39;re all going out to Ayaka&#39;s house
again?&quot; Konoka asked, the black haired women smiling
warmly.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Asuna grinned.

&quot;I&#39;ll go tell Set-chan then,&quot; Konoka positively
bounced up to her feet, &quot;I want her to wear the
swimsuit I bought her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be blushing the whole time we&#39;e there,&quot; Asuna
warned, having SEEN the tiny bikini earlier.

&quot;That&#39;s part of the fun,&quot; Konoka answered as she
headed out the door.

Negi smiled, his hair a slightly darker tone than
Asuna&#39;s. &quot;Do you think Ayaka will mind us coming over?
Things didn&#39;t go so well last time,&quot; he fretted.

Asuna reached out and ruffled Negi&#39;s hair, &quot;Don&#39;t
worry, she&#39;s always glad to see you.&quot;

&quot;She likes seeing you too,&quot; the pajama clad Negi
noted, &quot;even if she doesn&#39;t always want to admit it.&quot;

Asuna smiled slightly, &quot;Yeah, maybe so.&quot;

It didn&#39;t take long for most of the students of their
class to gather, then as a group they headed out to
Ayaka&#39;s family residence. All of them wore baggy
t-shirts, covering the more stylish swimsuits
underneath. 

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to trying her pool again,&quot; Kaede
smiled, the ninja girl&#39;s hair flowing in a long
ponytail.

&quot;I wanna ride the bannisters again,&quot; Fuka laughed,
her twin Fumika right beside her.

Kazumi Asakura smirked as she checked over her
everpresent camera, &quot;I&#39;m hoping for some more candid
shots.&quot;

&quot;For your private collection?&quot; Sayo Aisaka asked
teasingly, the ghost floating along side the infamous
reporter.

Misa smirked, the cheerleader walking with her
friends as she asked, &quot;Have you seen Setsuna&#39;s suit
yet?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s it like?&quot; Madoka asked, her short black hair
falling around her face.

Sakurako whistled, &quot;Pretty hot.&quot;

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Negi said as they reached the front
gate at last.

&quot;Welcome, Negi-sensei,&quot; Asyaka smiled, wearing a
expensive dress. She paused and added with a mock
frown, &quot;And the whole class, again.&quot;

Chisame scowled, &quot;Like I wanna be here, too.&quot;

&quot;You were forced then?&quot; Chachamaru asked mildly.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Chisame growled, glasses gleaming.

&quot;Try not to cause too much trouble for my staff,&quot;
Ayaka yelled as the students hurried off to get into
trouble all around the mansion.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Asuna asked a few moments later,
having accompanied Ayaka and Negi to have tea. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; a visibly flustered Ayaka answered, her
face faintly red and her heart racing as she
remembered the dream. It didn&#39;t help that Asuna had
stripped off her t-shirt to reveal a tight swimsuit
over her powerful body, highlighting her various
curves.

&quot;You look feverish,&quot; Negi noted innocently.

Asuna got up, moving over to Ayaka&#39;s side as she
ordered, &quot;Hold still.&quot;

&quot;What...?&quot; Ayaka started.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna check for a fever,&quot; Asuna informed her as
she swept their hair aside then pushed their foreheads
together.

&#39;Oh god,&#39; Ayaka thought, the clean scent of Asuna&#39;s
body washing over her. &#39;If I didn&#39;t have a fever
before,&#39; she mused, &#39;I certainly do now.&#39;</pre>
