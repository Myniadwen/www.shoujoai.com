<h1>The Chocolate (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hayabusa.html">HayabusaCena</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/chocolate-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The two girls were in their relaxation, exhausted and tired from looking 
at all of the great stuffs Asuna had bought for Ayaka. They could feel a 
few drops of sweat on their forehead. Ayaka contemplated about the whole 
thing that happened just moments ago. She couldn&#39;t imagine that Asuna 
would overly do the task even though that she expected her to normally 
finish the job. And in spite of all of these stuffs, she questioned why 
she would buy so many of them.

&quot;Asuna...&quot; Ayaka asked shyly, not looking at Asuna as she wiped her 
sweat drops with her hand.

&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; Asuna looked at her with her smile.

&quot;Thanks again for the stuffs you had bought to me.&quot; Ayaka slowly turned 
her head to face Asuna&#39;s before nervously smiled back at her.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome Ayaka-chan.&quot; Asuna replied, thanking her for her 
gratefulness. She wiped her own sweat drops with her hand.

&quot;I have to say, Asuna. All of these stuffs you purchased for me are very 
nice and valuable. They are really cool for rich people like me...&quot; The 
blonde-haired woman told her comment about those purchased stuff to her 
orange-haired friend before pausing. She was about to say something that 
could lower her smile and could moderate her feelings a little. &quot;But you 
don&#39;t have to give me so many of them. At least one of everything on the 
list that I gave you is alright. Even if they aren&#39;t great, they are 
alright for me as long as they don&#39;t suck.&quot; She unwillingly said, not 
wanting to see her lose her smile.

Indeed, Asuna&#39;s smile was lowered and her feelings were moderated but 
due to the spell from the chocolate that she ate while she was at their 
classroom, her smile and feelings were quickly back to their 
affectionate states. &quot;I understand that Ayaka-chan. I just want you to 
be happy all the time.&quot;

Ayaka&#39;s cheeks obtain a red tint on each of them. In other words, she 
blushed, only a little. Her eyes, mouth, and hands were quivering. She 
had never thought that Asuna would say something like that; something 
that was so nice, sweet and affectionate to hear. She looked away from 
her as her blush began to glow redder. She was stunned and didn&#39;t have 
anything to say for a moment.

&quot;Hey Ayaka-chan, are you okay?&quot; Asuna kept looking at Ayaka as she 
placed her hand on her arm. She was trying to waken Ayaka from her 
stunned form.

Ayaka was startled by that touch. She looked back at the blue and green 
eyed girl&#39;s cute face. &quot;Ah, yes, I&#39;m okay, Asuna-chan.&quot; She smiled again 
at her. Asuna simply giggled at her. However, she was surprised at 
herself when she unintentionally uttered &#39;Asuna-chan&#39;. &#39;Did... did I 
just call her...Asuna-chan?&#39; She mentally asked to herself, wondering if 
she really said that.

A thought hatched inside Ayaka&#39;s mind. She considered that there could 
be a reason why Asuna had to buy all of these cool-looking stuffs. &quot;Hey, 
um, did you buy all of these just so I would be pleased enough not to 
tell about that secret accident that we had to kept to Takahata-sensei?&quot;

Even though that the spell from the delicious chocolate that Asuna ate 
had made her like a lover to Ayaka, making the Iincho girl please wasn&#39;t 
the only thing in her during those hours. &quot;That accident where I 
accidentally broke Takahata-sensei&#39;s most valuable? I dealt with it 
before I bought your things.&quot;

Ayaka was shocked to hear that. She was inquisitive to know about what 
happened to her and Takahata. &quot;You dealt with it? Did you go to 
Takahata-sensei and apologized for breaking his vase?&quot; She asked with 
inquiry.

&quot;Yes and you&#39;re exactly right.&quot;

&quot;Well how did it go? Was Takahata-sensei mad at you?&quot;

&quot;Actually he wasn&#39;t. After I told him about the accident, he just 
forgave me with a smile. He also told me that the vase wasn&#39;t very 
valuable at all. In fact, it wasn&#39;t his vase as well. He is such a very 
nice man, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, he is.&quot;

Ayaka wanted to know something else. She wanted to know about her 
feelings towards her former teacher and to see if she still had a crush 
on him. &quot;So, do you still have a crush on him?&quot; She asked.

The other girl thought of that for a while. &quot;Well, I still love him 
Ayaka-chan. When I was an orphan, he took care of me. He was like my 
father. He made me happy and I learned a lot from him. When I became 13 
years old, I had a crush on him, after everything he had done for me. 
But when I realized that he was an adult and I&#39;m still a teenager, I had 
to let go of my romantic feelings for him. Yet, I still love him and I 
care about him.&quot;

After hearing that, Ayaka began to fear that she forgot about him so 
that she could get &#39;closer&#39; to her. Both girls looked away from each 
other for a moment, causing a silence. Asuna spoke first but didn&#39;t look 
at Ayaka. &quot;Hey, Ayaka-chan...&quot;

&quot;Oh, what is it, Asuna?&quot; Ayaka eagerly waited for what Asuna would say 
to her. This time, she made sure that the nickname &#39;Asuna-chan&#39;, which 
Ayaka had accidentally called her, didn&#39;t slip through her mouth.

&quot;Can I ...&quot; But before she could finish her offer, another three knocks 
on the door were heard. Both girls turned their attention to the door 
and heard a voice. &quot;Asuna-chan, are you there? It&#39;s me, Konoka-chan.&quot; It 
was Konoka, one of Asuna&#39;s friends.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m here Kono-chan.&quot; Asuna responded. &#39;Kono-chan&#39; was the nickname 
Konoka had always wanted to hear from her lover Setsuna.

&quot;Asuna-chan, you have to help the other girls on the preparations for 
the Teachers&#39; Party. We need your assistance.&quot; Konoka said from behind 
the door.

As much as Asuna would to stay and talk with Ayaka, helping others had 
been one of her top priorities. A frown expression was formed on her 
face but as soon she stood up her smiling expression went back. &quot;Well I 
guess I&#39;ll tell you about my offer later, Ayaka-chan. I&#39;ll see you 
later.&quot; She said before giving her friend a kiss on the cheek. As soon 
as Ayaka felt the soft lips of Asuna, her face glowed red quickly, her 
entire body vigorously burned up as if she was about to blaze. Her heart 
beat so furiously like she was having a Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. 
Asuna pulled her lips away from her cheeks and looked at Ayaka with a 
smile. Meanwhile, Ayaka&#39;s body turned red and was quivering, looking at 
her with a stoned look. Asuna then ran towards the door and left her 
room.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Kono-chan, let&#39;s go!&quot; Asuna said as soon as she met her before 
the two walked together.

Ayaka was completely stunned and didn&#39;t move an inch as if she became a 
stone. She sluggishly cupped her kissed cheek. &quot;Asu-asu-na... Wh-what 
the heck is go-going on w-with you?&quot; She stuttered, couldn&#39;t get her 
wondering question straight.

&#39;You know Ayaka-chan. I kinda like that kiss.&#39; Out of nowhere, the voice 
made her presence known inside her mind.

&quot;You again!&quot; The class rep was absolutely displeased to hear her again. 
Her voice just made things worse for her.

&#39;Ah why are you so mad, my dear? Or maybe it&#39;s just me?&#39; She 
sarcastically replies to her.

&quot;Err... why do you care so much about Asuna? And why do you want me to 
be with her anyway?&quot; Ayaka barked at her but seemingly, she barked at 
herself, to her conscience.

&#39;Haven&#39;t you felt something from her yet? She longs for you. She just 
simply wants you and I&#39;m sure you feel the same. You liked that cheek 
kiss Asuna-chan gave to you and I know that you do.&#39;

&quot;Asuna and I are just friends, plain and simple. And why do you keep 
calling her Asuna-chan?&quot;

&#39;What about you? You called her that as well you know.&#39;

&quot;Look! Why don&#39;t you quit hooking me up with her. She&#39;s up to something 
really bad. She&#39;s just pretending that she loves me.&quot;

Her conscience could feel her stubbornness and she was getting tired of 
it. Ayaka wasn&#39;t showing any indication of letting Asuna romantic 
feelings get into her. &#39;So you don&#39;t love Asuna-chan at all, do you?&#39; 
she sighed.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Ayaka answered, but she felt that wasn&#39;t what she wanted to say. 
&quot;I just respect her.&quot; That wasn&#39;t even enough to make herself feel 
happy.

&#39;Well alright. I will refrain from hooking you up with Asuna-chan. I 
will no longer annoy you about Asuna-chan&#39;s amorous feelings for you.&#39; 
She finally had enough. However, just because she finally had enough 
didn&#39;t mean that she would let her off the hook. She still had something 
else in her scheme. Nevertheless, she faded away again from Ayaka&#39;s 
mind.

XXXOOOXXXOOOXXX

It was a rough day for Ayaka. She had a lot of things to deal with and 
they were all taken care of. One of them was dealing with Asuna and her 
uncharacteristic personality. Her original personality was being mean, 
daffy, violent, short-tempered, and obnoxious towards her and found 
herself into lots of fights with her. However, she was very different 
earlier. While all of the said characteristics were her original ones, 
the way she acted early was being nice, happy, obedient, sweet, kind, 
and loving towards her. She had been wondering many times why Asuna 
acting like that. Such a seemingly &#39;change of heart&#39; made her feel 
worried.

Another one of the things she had to deal with was... well herself; her 
conscience and at the same time the voice. The voice had been pestering 
her about Asuna and her affections for her. After scolding her, Ayaka 
had thought that she finally stopped her intentions, although she was 
unaware that the voice was faking it.

Anyway, it was 10 in the evening and it was the time for Ayaka to have 
her big sleep. She deserved this after all the work (and of course 
dealing with Asuna and her conscience) had been done. However, she would 
have to sleep all alone in her dorm room as her roommates Chizuru and 
Natsumi told her that they would sleep in Negi, Asuna, and Konoka&#39;s dorm 
room. Their reason was to stay there and study with Negi.

She was wearing her red pajamas with numerous chibi-Negi heads printed 
all over them. She slowly lay down on her own bed which had chibi-Negi 
heads also printed all over her bed sheet. She covered herself with her 
sheet before looking up at the ceiling, her head resting on her hands. 
As she looked up at it, an image of Asuna came from out of nowhere in 
her head. She rapidly shook her head, trying to kick the image out of 
her mind. However, that image came back quickly and every time Ayaka 
shook her head, it kept coming back. Feeling the urge to give up, Ayaka 
surrendered and rested her slightly dizzy head. As she looked up at the 
ceiling again, she finally thought about Asuna.

&#39;What&#39;s with Asuna? She was acting so... so different earlier. She was 
so nice to me. I knew that she did do my order but she didn&#39;t have to do 
it excessively as if she wanted to be my servant.&#39; Ayaka contemplated. 
&#39;Is she just pretending or has she changed?&#39;

Ayaka had never seen Asuna acted that way. She always thought that Asuna 
would never act so friendly, nice, and sweet towards her. Even though 
she liked her early uncharacteristic manner, she didn&#39;t seem to find it 
right. She liked the old Asuna better.

However, this wasn&#39;t the time for her to think about it. Right now, it 
was time for her to get to sleep. She needed some rest and she set her 
thoughts aside. &#39;Well I can sort this out tomorrow. Right now, I need my 
puny nap. Asuna is obviously just trying to get into my head.&#39; Ayaka 
mentally said before turning to her left and took a deep nap. After 
that, she had a dream; a dream where it was one of her childhood 
memories with Asuna.

XXXOOOXXXOOOXXX

&quot;Hey Ayaka-chan...&quot; Little Asuna called her little friend and rival 
Ayaka. As Ayaka heard that, she turned around and looked at her. The two 
little girls were at a playground where it was filled with many play 
equipments like swings, seesaw, slides and sandboxes. &quot;Let&#39;s play 
together!&quot; Asuna cheerfully offered, giving her a cute smile.

&quot;Play...?&quot; Ayaka wondered what they would be playing. &quot;What are we going 
to play, Asuna-chan?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s play building a sandcastle together!&quot; Asuna replied, her smile 
was still intact.

Ayaka simply accepted, smiling back at her before responding. &quot;Okay!&quot;

Not wanting to stand for a minute, the two went to a nearby sandbox. 
They picked up their pail and shovel and started the sandcastle 
construction. As they constructed the base of the castle, Asuna had an 
urge to speak to Ayaka. &quot;Hey, Ayaka-chan...&quot; She shyly uttered as the 
base was finished. They proceeded on building the other parts of the 
sandcastle.

Ayaka heard that and looked at her while continuing to construct. &quot;Yes?&quot; 
She was eager to know what she would say next.

&quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;

That was an interesting question for Ayaka. &quot;Well...&quot; She contemplated 
for a good answer as she looked up at the sky, temporarily stopping her 
construction, &quot;I want to grow up to be a kindergarten teacher. I want to 
teach kids about good values and give them a good education. But most of 
all, I want to have fun with them and make good and memorable moments 
with them.&quot;

Asuna liked her answer. She found her ambition amazing and wondering. 
She always thought that her friend would one day be a marvelous and 
successful woman and she would fulfill her dreams. And even though they 
were also rivals, she was proud that Ayaka was her best rival she ever 
had. Before the death of Ayaka&#39;s newly born brother occured, Asuna and 
Ayaka met in a classroom where the teacher introduced Asuna to Ayaka and 
her class. It wasn&#39;t long before they became rivals. But was the only 
rivalry they had during their times as kids? Arguing and fighting, were 
those the only things they do with each other? The answer to those 
questions is simply no. They were more than just rivals; they were also 
friends. Their arguing and fighting were like the ways on how they 
communicate with each other. And of course they talked, had fun, and got 
along together.

&quot;Wow! You have a great ambition, Ayaka-chan.&quot; Asuna cheerfully replied.

&quot;Thanks Asuna-chan!&quot; Ayaka happily appreciated her reply. Suddenly she 
wanted to ask Asuna the same question. &quot;And... Hey, what about you? What 
do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;

Asuna never expected that Ayaka would return that question back to her. 
But anyway, she was glad to reply. &quot;I want to be a kindergarten teacher 
too!&quot;

Ayaka was amazed that Asuna had the same ambition. But when she 
contemplated about that, she believed that it wasn&#39;t her real dream. 
&quot;Really? Are you just saying that or you want to be just like me?&quot; She 
inquired with a smile. Their sandcastle was near to its completion.

&quot;No really Ayaka-chan. I want to be a kindergarten teacher and it&#39;s not 
because that I want to be just like you. It&#39;s because I love kids!&quot;&quot;And 
I too love kids Asuna-chan. I guess we have the same dream and reason.&quot;

The two discussed about their dreams and ambitions for several minutes 
as they built their sandcastle. While at that, the two young girls 
laughed and giggled, talking about something. Finally, they finished 
their sandcastle and then stood in front of it. While it wasn&#39;t 
elaborate, big, and impressive, it looked great for the girls. After 
all, they were too young to create something that is awesome.

&quot;Ayaka-chan...&quot; Asuna spoke to her, staring at the sandcastle they 
built.

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Ayaka turned her head to her.

&quot;I hope that we make the best of friends while growing up.&quot; Asuna said 
with a cheerful smile. Those words and that smile made Ayaka blush a 
little. However, something reminded her that she and Ayaka were more 
than just... friends. &quot;Yeah, well have you forgotten that we&#39;re rivals 
as well?&quot; She said with a mean tone as she looked away at her, crossing 
her arms.

Asuna was surprised that Ayaka would say something like that. Of course, 
she always thought that they were rivals along the way. She turned to 
her own mean side. &quot;Oh I haven&#39;t forgotten that Ayaka-chan. We are 
rivals but do you want to know who wins most of the time? Me!&quot; She said 
with a smirk.

This was no doubt angered Ayaka. Her head shot at Asuna&#39;s face. &quot;Oh 
yeah, well I&#39;m better than you, so I win more times than you!&quot;

&quot;Since when have you been better than me, Ayaka-chan?! I&#39;m stronger and 
I have more skills than you!&quot; Asuna bashed.

&quot;Well I&#39;m more popular and smarter than you. And most of all...&quot; Ayaka 
returned the favor and then paused.

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Asuna impatiently wanted to know what she was about to say.

&quot;I&#39;m simply more beautiful than you!&quot; Those were the words Ayaka spitted 
out, which infuriated Asuna.

The orange-haired girl gritted her teeth with anger, her eyes were 
blazing fire. &quot;OH YEAH?!&quot; Asuna vehemently said.

&quot;YEAH!!!&quot; The blonde-haired girl simply replied with the same angry face 
expression as the other girl was having. They glared intensively and 
furiously at each other, as if their blazing eyes were forming a line of 
lightning. However, their eye-to-eye conflict didn&#39;t last long; a smile 
was slowly formed on each girl&#39;s face and their eyes were reverted from 
their glaring form. Not surprisingly though, their faces went back to 
their happy expression. As they stared at one another, they giggled.

&quot;You know Asuna-chan, you&#39;re cute when you angry.&quot; Ayaka said, still 
staring at her with a smile.

&quot;And you look like an angry teddy bear when you get mad.&quot; Asuna gladly 
replied before laughing at what she had said.

&quot;So um, will you come at my mansion later?&quot; Ayaka shyly, going red.

&quot;Sure thing, Ayaka-chan... Let&#39;s have fun again.&quot; Asuna beamed.

&quot;That&#39;s what I had in mind.&quot; Ayaka beamed back.

And that was the end of Ayaka&#39;s dream, as it faded away. As the Iincho 
slept while dreaming, she smiled. She was apparently happy about that 
dream and she was happy to recall that moment.

XXXOOOXXXOOOXXX

It was half past 7 in the morning and Ayaka was still sleeping 
peacefully like a Sleeping Beauty. She was awaked but her eyes were not 
opened yet. Suddenly, she felt something from her behind. She sluggishly 
turned to her right, not bothering to open her eyes. She touched that 
something with her hands and felt that the figure shaped like a person. 
Strangely, she even smelled it and its scent was so attracting. She 
thought of the person and hoping that it was one of her love ones... 
well, or maybe her most favorite teacher in her life.

&quot;Negi...&quot; She murmured, breathing leisurely at the person she was facing 
and who she was assuming. A smirk appeared on her face as she also felt 
that the person is sleeping. She pulled &quot;Negi&quot; towards her and leaned 
for a big kiss. And just so &quot;Negi&quot; wouldn&#39;t try to break the kiss 
himself prematurely (and sadly), she wrapped her right arm around his 
neck - or maybe &quot;his&quot; neck - then wrapped her other arm around &quot;his&quot; 
waist before hugging &quot;him&quot; extremely tightly. She was basking the 
feeling of her &quot;teacher&#39;s&quot; lips. &quot;Negi-sensei&#39;s lips are so soft and 
smooth...&quot; she contemplated in her mind with pure excitement as she 
consumed &quot;his&quot; lips of tenderness.

&quot;Oh... Negi-sensei... I...&quot; Ayaka muttered, her lips were still 
connected to &quot;his&quot;. She slowly opened her eyes, wanting to see 
&quot;his&quot;closed eyes and cute face being so close to hers. And then, her 
satisfaction of touching &quot;Negi&#39;s&quot; adorable lips... sank. Her happiness 
of being with her inspiring teacher Negi on the same bed... went 
downhill, disappointingly.

She wasn&#39;t kissing her Negi; heck, she wasn&#39;t even kissing a male! 
That&#39;s right! She was in fact kissing another girl! And to make things 
worse (or better for those who are reading this fic right now!), the 
girl she was kissing right now was one of her childhood friends! (You 
get the picture right?) Ayaka was in a world of shock. Her eyes were 
completely shock as she looked upon the closed eyes of her younger 
friend and of course, her rival. Her lovely face heated up so fast that 
it made her face turn crimson red and her heart beat wildly.

&quot;No... It can&#39;t be! Asuna!&quot; she mentally shouted as she jerked herself 
back from her &quot;accident&quot; kiss with Asuna. She heavily panted, her heart 
still beating unusually. Due to the temporarily abnormal beat rate of 
her heart, she tried to calm it down by holding her chest as she looked 
at Asuna, who was now awake.

&quot;Hmm... Oh! Good morning, Ayaka-chan!&quot;
