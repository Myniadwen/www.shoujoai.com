<h1>Quiet Morning (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sticky.html">Sticky the Dog</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/quietmorn-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>       Setsuna tossed and turned in her bed, struggling to get 
comfortable. Despite being billed by Evangeline as a &quot;resort&quot; or an 
&quot;oasis&quot;, Setsuna found the air here to be a bit humid. Perhaps it was 
the influx of magical energy in the air, or the fact that they were all 
much smaller now, but the point was, it wasn&#39;t as cool as she would have 
preferred it. Letting out a frustrated sigh, she gave up on sleeping 
under the covers of the futon, throwing them off of herself. She stood 
up for a moment to put them back down on the mattress, pausing to relish 
in a cool breeze that was passing by. Feeling slightly refreshed, she 
lay back down on the futon, hoping she could get some sleep before it 
was time to wake up.

       This annoying heat wasn&#39;t helped by the fact that she was still 
in her uniform; she had sweated almost all the way through it. She sat 
up and wiped a thick wall of droplets from her brow, taking this 
opportunity to glance around the room. She didn&#39;t see bodies stirring, 
so she decided that she&#39;d be okay. She quickly unbuttoned her dress 
shirt, and slid it off as quietly as she could, leaving her with just 
her bra to cover her top. She closed her eyes and let the air caress 
against her bare skin. The sweat blowing across her body cooled her 
down, and for once she felt like she could fall asleep in this place. 
She had no sooner put her head on her pillow and closed her eyes when 
she heard footsteps close in on her. She quickly sat up, regretting the 
decision to sleep on top of the blankets, as she had nothing to cover 
herself with. She haphazardly arranged her hands in front of herself, 
struggling to make out the form that was crouched down next to her.

       It was Konoka.

       &quot;Kono-Chan,&quot; Setsuna said, half-tired, half-surprised, &quot;Did you 
need something?&quot; Konoka had her usual look on her face: a sort of 
happily air headed expression. It was a look that Setsuna really liked. 
In this case, it put her into a sort of emotionally defenseless state. 
Setsuna adopted one of her usual looks, one of dumbfounded surprise. A 
larger sweat drop joined the group that was already on her forehead, as 
her face reddened.

       Konoka kept smiling as she answered, &quot;I noticed you looked 
uncomfortable, Set-Chan. I thought maybe I could help you.&quot; She brought 
her face closer to Setsuna&#39;s, opening her eyes completely as she did so.

       Setsuna started a slow pant. It always sent her heart into a 
flutter whenever Konoka got close like this, especially after 
their...experience in the dorm room a few weeks earlier. Konoka had 
acted like her usual self since, but she had still sworn that her acts 
had been born out of true love, not just magically-enhanced impulses. 
However, Setsuna had begun to doubt this, as Konoka had not done 
anything out of the ordinary since. Rather, she had acted like the 
entire encounter had never happened, not just to the others, but to 
Setsuna as well.

       &quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry. I haven&#39;t forgotten,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s eyes 
widened as they stared into Konoka&#39;s; it was like Konoka had read her 
mind. &quot;You think I didn&#39;t notice? You were so calm when we were together 
in there. Maybe I could help you relax in here, too,&quot; She took Setsuna&#39;s 
head in her hands, and brought their faces together.

       Setsuna was quivering, her voice shook as she spoke, &quot;Kono-Chan, 
we can&#39;t...the others...&quot; But it was no use, Konoka&#39;s face was locked on 
course. She brought her lips within millimeters of Setsuna&#39;s, softly 
chanting her name.

       &quot;Set-Chan...Set-Chan...&quot;

       Konoka gently moved the sleeping Setsuna&#39;s head back and forth 
with her hand, trying to stir her. &quot;Set-Chan...Set-Chan wake 
up...Set-Chan...&quot;

       Setsuna&#39;s eyes blinked open, and she was instantly transported 
out of the dream. She lifted herself up. She still had her shirt on, and 
she was still under the covers. And she was still hot.

       She rubbed her eyes with her hands, making out the form of a 
decidedly less intending Konoka than the one that had appeared in her 
dream. &quot;Kono-Chan, did you need something?&quot;

       Konoka motioned around the room. &quot;I just woke up, and everyone 
else is gone.&quot;

       Setsuna immediately guessed that it must be something minor, but 
the look on Konoka&#39;s face told Setsuna that she thought it was much more 
serious. &quot;Well, I know Negi was still out training when we went to bed, 
and I think I saw Asuna go out after him,&quot; she answered, &quot;Maybe everyone 
else just found their way out there.&quot; She tried to sound as gentle as 
possible, like a parent trying to console a scared child. Truth be told, 
that&#39;s not how she felt about Konoka, but she got the impression that 
that was how Konoka wanted to be spoken to. &quot;Do you want to go out and 
check?&quot;

       Konoka brightened up a bit, which pleased Setsuna. &quot;No. You&#39;re 
right, they&#39;re probably fine. I&#39;m just being silly; worrying about 
nothing.&quot;

       &quot;It&#39;s okay, there&#39;s nothing wrong with worrying about friends. 
You can always come to me with stuff like this,&quot; Setsuna placed her hand 
on Konoka&#39;s shoulder. She meant what she was saying, and wanted Konoka 
to be sure. &quot;Just remember I&#39;m here. Now, let&#39;s try and get some sleep. 
More than the others will get, anyway.&quot;

       &quot;Good idea,&quot; Konoka said, &quot;Thanks, Set-Chan.&quot; She began to walk 
away, Setsuna watching as she did so. After a time, Setsuna put her head 
back down and closed her eyes, only to once again be stirred by the 
sound of close footsteps.

       This time she opened her eyes to the sight of Konoka cheerily 
putting her bedding down next to Setsuna&#39;s. &quot;Kono-Chan,&quot; She said, ever 
wearily, &quot;What are you doing now?&quot;

       Konoka flashed a smile. &quot;If no one else is here, I don&#39;t want to 
be by myself over there. I&#39;ll sleep next to you, since I know you don&#39;t 
mind.&quot;

       Setsuna&#39;s face flushed. What Konoka said was true, but she wasn&#39;t 
sure if she was comfortable with her knowing it.

       Konoka slipped inside her now arranged bedding, still smiling at 
Setsuna. &quot;There&#39;s no need to be embarrassed, Set-Chan. I think we&#39;re 
close enough that I can know that about you, especially since you know 
the same thing about me.&quot;

       At this point, Setsuna noticed the arrangement of the futons: 
Konoka had purposely put them close together; the sides of the 
mattresses were practically touching. As Konoka lay down, the eyes of 
the girls met, and Konoka took on a slightly more serious expression. 
Her mouth fell agape, and Setsuna felt her hot breath on her face. She 
breathed deep, taking it in. Konoka&#39;s eyes dodged out of Setsuna&#39;s gaze. 
&quot;I know I haven&#39;t said it since, but I want to tell you now: I love you, 
Set-Chan. I just want to make sure you still know that.&quot; Konoka had on 
her face the same look she had had all those weeks ago in the kitchen, 
like she would cry if not for being able to see Setsuna in front of her.

       That look was all the proof of her love that Setsuna needed. She 
moved her left hand to the back of Konoka&#39;s head, and began stroking her 
gently. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry,&quot; she said reassuringly, &quot;I know. I&#39;ve 
always known since. And I love you too. One day, we&#39;ll be able to tell 
everyone else, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be happy for us then.&quot;

       Konoka&#39;s gentle eyes widened. That revelation to everyone had 
been a key thought on Konoka&#39;s mind, and it made her feel better that 
Setsuna had been thinking of the same thing. It was nice to think that 
they were on a similar wavelength. It gave her more confidence in the 
idea of having an actual relationship with Setsuna, which is what she 
wanted more than anything in the world. It&#39;s what she had wanted since 
junior high had started, and she found out that Setsuna was going to be 
in her class. And ever since that morning in the kitchen, the idea of 
her and Setsuna being a couple had been something she dreamed of almost 
constantly.

       Her eyes shimmered, looking into Setsuna&#39;s. What Setsuna had just 
said, it was wonderful; she was speechless. Setsuna noticed this. She 
shifted herself over to Konoka&#39;s futon, lifting her left leg over. She 
righted herself, repositioning incrementally until she was sitting on 
top of Konoka, Setsuna&#39;s legs straddled across either side of Konoka&#39;s 
waist. She continued stroking the back of Konoka&#39;s head with her left 
hand, bringing herself slowly down with her right. She brought her face 
closer and closer until finally, their lips met, as they had far too 
long ago.

       Both of them relished in this moment, every inch of their mouths 
moving instinctively, making up for the lost time. Konoka wrapped her 
arms around Setsuna&#39;s body, squeezing her tightly before they both came 
up for air. Both girls were already panting hard, their breath crossing 
and entering each others&#39; mouths. Setsuna was now hotter than she had 
been earlier, but didn&#39;t feel like complaining. All the energy that had 
been building up between her and Konoka over the past few weeks was now 
being released, and that feeling eclipsed any minor discomfort she would 
have felt otherwise.

       Raising herself up more, she brought her hands down to the top 
button of Konoka&#39;s shirt. She undid it quickly, and moved down through 
the others. She spread the shirt open, revealing Konoka&#39;s bra. It was a 
front-clasp, so she undid it at the same time, and pushed it to the 
sides with the shirt. Last time, Setsuna hadn&#39;t gotten to this point 
with her, Konoka had dominated most of that exchange. Konoka&#39;s breasts 
were a bit bigger than hers, but Setsuna was hardly in a position to be 
jealous. She placed her hands on them and began toying with them, 
leaning in to use her tongue.

       Konoka was surprised by how active about this Setsuna was being. 
She was sweating heavily, hyperventilating. She closed her eyes and 
hugged Setsuna tighter, before releasing. Setsuna withdrew her face from 
Konoka&#39;s chest, pausing on the way up to place a kiss on Konoka&#39;s neck. 
When Setsuna&#39;s body was in full view, Konoka undid her shirt. Setsuna&#39;s 
bra was rear-clasp, so Konoka peeled off Setsuna&#39;s shirt, then undid her 
bra. Once again she pulled Setsuna against her body, both girls 
caressing the other&#39;s neck with their lips. Their breasts pressed 
against each other gently, curving together as if their bodies were made 
for each other.

       They were still under the covers, so they were getting hotter by 
the minute. Sweat poured from every inch of their bodies. They could 
feel each other becoming wetter, not just from sweat, but from the 
anticipation that was building up between each girl&#39;s legs. Setsuna 
slipped through Konoka&#39;s grasp, sitting back up on top of her lower 
legs. Konoka moved her now-free arms down to the futon and squeezed the 
mattress to alleviate the pressure that was building up in every inch of 
her body. Setsuna used her fingers to trace a light line across Konoka&#39;s 
stomach, tickling her lightly as she went. When she reached the bottom, 
she pulled off Konoka&#39;s skirt and panties in one swift motion, then 
quickly did away with her own.

       Now both of them worked together, to intertwine their legs and 
press their slits  together. Setsuna braced her arms against the ground 
around Konoka&#39;s head, while Konoka maintained her grasp around Setsuna&#39;s 
midsection. Both girls shook with this new feeling of their bodies 
touching in this way. It was something neither of them had ever come 
close to feeling. Setsuna gyrated her hips, rubbing against Konoka, who 
hugged her tighter and tighter with every motion, squeezing her eyes 
shut until pressure overcame her and tears began to stream down her 
face. Soon they began kissing deeply, their tongues also moving in time 
with the motions.

       It was this sort of act that they knew they had wanted to do the 
first time. To make love truly, to use it to prove their love to each 
other. They were locked together between their legs, with energy flowing 
between them, electrifying each and every one of their senses, sending 
their bodies into tingling spasms as the coursing motions rippled 
through them. They were covered in fluid of every imaginable sort, 
causing their bodies to stick to each other, making it only more 
desirable that they bring themselves ever closer to one another.

       The girls were passionate about their lovemaking, but they were 
still young and inexperienced. Their tension released early, immense 
satisfaction mixing with disappointment at the fact that it couldn&#39;t 
have lasted longer, similar to the freshly released juices mixing 
between their legs. Setsuna withdrew from their kiss, saliva falling 
from her mouth into Konoka&#39;s. She allowed her head to go to the side of 
Konoka&#39;s, letting their bodies press against each other even more 
tightly. They let out long satisfied sighs nearly in unison. Now, each 
girl felt she would be able to fall asleep without trouble.

       They were startled from their newfound relaxation by footsteps 
approaching from the outside. Setsuna, thinking quickly, slid off of 
Konoka into her own futon and pulled the covers over her naked body. 
Konoka followed suit, and the two of them feigned sleep as the intruder, 
an excited Asakura, entered.

       &quot;Konoka! Setsuna! Wake up, you&#39;ve gotta come see this!&quot; As the 
two poked their heads out from the covers to greet Asakura, they 
struggled to redress themselves under the blankets. Asakura, perceptive 
as she was, noticed that Konoka&#39;s futon had been moved, as well as the 
mysterious motions that were taking place under the covers. She took 
note of this, but decided not to mention anything at this point, as the 
present situation was much more immediate. &quot;Negi&#39;s telling Asuna the 
story of his dad, and we&#39;re all watching! You need to hurry up before 
it&#39;s all over. Come on!&quot; Setsuna and Konoka managed to finish clothing 
themselves, got up, and followed Asakura out to where the others were.

       Once again, they had been forced to hide their actions before 
they could fully enjoy each others&#39; company, but both girls knew that a 
day would come when they could bring their love into the view of their 
classmates and openly pursue a life together.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, I originally planned to have this just be a one-shot, but after I 
posted the first one, several people said they wanted it to continue! 
(There&#39;s not too many KonoSetsu fics on www.adultfanfiction.net, 
surprisingly). Once again, I made a point of trying to keep it in 
continuity, though you can already see me playing around with what 
characters know and the things they feel (Asakura in particular. She&#39;s a 
character I really like).</pre>
