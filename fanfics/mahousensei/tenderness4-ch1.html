This is a sequel to "Tenderness 
3". Like with previous parts, please have patience with any and all 
OOC behaviour, and also beware that I might come to hint at/imply/mention 
other possible female couples of Negima, like for instance Mana/Kaede 
(see Tenderness Sidestory: Things That Go Nin-nin In The Night, for 
their story)<br><br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Looking back one would always 
say that the years had passed by quickly, no matter how slowly time 
passed while you were right in the middle of events, and ironically 
the more chaotic a certain period was, somehow it had passed all the 
more quickly, or so it seemed.<br><br>
These were the things that 
a slightly sentimental Konoe Setsuna pondered while standing on the 
wooden walkway on the backside of her house, looking out at the darkening 
spring sky. Just to think, if she had told the girl she had been only  
four years ago that on this day she would be standing here, be the person 
she was now, well... she wouldn't have believed herself.<br>
<br>
Like the house, for instance. 
To say that it was hers was of course somewhat false, in truth it was 
just a small part of the vast properties of the Konoe family, and it 
was not even as if it was truly a separate house. Here in Kono-chan's 
ancestral home in Kyoto the building complexes were almost a small city 
unto themselves, much like Mahora had been, and one way or another contained 
most of what either of them could need. Master Eishun... her soon-to-be 
father-in-law, had kindly provided Konoka and Setsuna with a small building 
of their own, off one side of the main complex, where the two could 
have some privacy and some illusion of a normal home. <br>
<br>
Konoka could be domestic to 
her heart's content, cook and clean and all those things that for 
some reason she took pleasure in, where in the rest of the vastness 
of her home she had servants that would perform every little task before 
she could even think about it. Setsuna on the other hand more than anything 
appreciated that in this house they were away from everyone else, as 
no-one bothered them there unless it was for something important. Behind 
closed doors they could be like any young couple deeply in love, and 
not concern themselves with the status that they held more here than 
anywhere else in the world.<br><br>
The house had been a gift for 
them shortly after their engagement had been made official, during a 
short trip back to Kyoto for formality's sake, and the young Setsuna 
had shed a few tears in private when it had dawned on her that rather 
than just a place to stay for a while she now had a place to call home. 
They had stayed in it for the few occasional holidays over the following 
years when they had been able to go back to Kyoto, but it was not until 
after they finished school that they could truly move in.<br>
<br>
It was... quiet there, and 
peaceful. Sometimes Setsuna found herself missing the life of the dorms, 
with friends nearby on all sides, but all she needed to do when the 
odd pang of longing came upon her was to walk over to the main building 
and the constant activity there, or walk over to the dojo where the 
young shinmeiryuu warrior was more than welcome, her skills having gotten 
famous among her peers over the years.<br><br>
She imagined that in time they 
would miss the constant presence of their friends, but for now there 
had been no opportunity to do so. After all, they had graduated from 
Mahora only a short while ago, and now, this special spring, she and 
Kono-chan were to get married at long last.<br><br>
The past week friends from 
all over had dropped in, until the last ones to arrive showed up the 
day before, leaving them all back together again. Some friends had complained 
that they had not been given the opportunity to throw Setsuna and Konoka 
bridal showers - or, as someone had joked about Setsuna, a bachelor's 
party - but considering that all of Kono-chan's friends were also 
Setsuna's friends and vice versa, the party bit had proved too awkward 
to arrange. The planned wedding-party would compensate for this to the 
more party-hungry guests, they hoped, as it was going to be a big one.<br>
<br>
Setsuna smiled up at the sky. <i>
She was going to marry Kono-chan.</i><br><br>
As if summoned by Setsuna's 
thoughts a pair of arms appeared to wrap themselves around her waist 
and a warm body pressed up against her back. Setsuna placed a tender 
kiss into the palm of one hand before folding her arms over them, hearing 
Kono-chan's pleased hum against the back of her shoulder.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing out here 
Secchan?"<br><br>
Setsuna turned around so she 
could face her love as she held her close, feeling again that small 
tickle of amusement that still showed up on rare occasion regarding 
the fact that these days she actually had to look <i>down</i> a little 
when she met Kono-chan's eyes. Setsuna's growth spurt had taken 
time in coming, but once it did she had shot up almost as if overnight, 
becoming a tall woman with a strong, lean body and... if Setsuna had 
to acknowledge it herself... somewhat more attributes than her early 
years had to show for her.<br><br>
"Thinking of you, love."<br>
<br>
Konoka was rather tall as well, 
though in a group of unusually tall women she had been one of the shorter 
ones. Few among them would not gladly have given their height and any 
one random appendage of choice to have Konoka's looks however... when 
the lovely Kyoto heiress had filled out she had gotten a body that would 
make any model or movie star weep, and combined with her angelic face, 
sparkling eyes and the long shiny hair, Konoka was simply stunning. 
When they during their latter years at Mahora had been walking in town 
Setsuna had gotten the habit of always looking as intimidating as possible, 
to stave off the talent scouts and the men erroneously thinking that 
a woman without male companionship must be single and therefore free 
game. <br><br>
A soft giggle interrupted further 
admiration of Konoka's alluring curves. "Yes... I think I can see <i>
that</i>, Secchan."<br><br>
Konoka wrapped her arms around 
Setsuna's neck, a heated look in her eyes as she purred, close to 
Setsuna's ear. "See something you like?"<br><br>
"Very." Setsuna rumbled 
and kissed Konoka's neck, leading to the sharing of several toe-curling 
kisses that left them both slightly breathless. Konoka growled and clung 
to the front of Setsuna's shirt, taking a moment to recover while 
Setsuna tenderly kissed her head and lightly ran fingers through Konoka's 
long hair.<br><br>
"Whose idea was it anyway, 
not to make love for a whole week before getting married?" She groused 
slightly, lifting her face enough to give Setsuna an adorably pouty 
look.<br><br>
Setsuna grinned. "That would 
be yours, Kono-chan."<br><br>
Konoka growled again and bumped 
her head playfully against Setsuna's shoulder. "Really? How silly 
of me." She took a step back and began pulling gently at Setsuna's 
hand, smiling widely. "Now why would I do that, Secchan?"<br>
<br>
"Wedding night, love." 
Setsuna said affectionately, amused with her beloved's antics, and 
willingly let herself be led back inside the house.<br>
<br>
"Wedding night, huh? Hmm, 
I suppose so..." Konoka pretended to think it over as she led them 
to the living room. "Oh alright, have it your way." She grinned 
and pulled Setsuna close again. "But you had better be sure you rest 
well until tomorrow, Secchan... because I don't plan on letting you 
have <i>any</i> sleep."<br><br>
"Yes, whatever you want... 
ojousama." Setsuna answered, voice and face as deadpan as she could 
manage.<br><br>
"Mou! Secchan!" Konoka 
laughed and grabbed a small pillow off the couch to hit Setsuna with. 
Setsuna retaliated by tickling, and they fell to the couch, laughing 
and squealing. They squirmed around for a while before settling down 
just holding one another.<br><br>
"Secchan..." Konoka whispered, 
her head leaning of Setsuna's shoulder. "Tomorrow."<br>
<br>
"Yes... <i>tomorrow</i>."<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
So came the day when childhood 
friends turned lovers would wed, with all the paraphernalia as befitting 
the Konoe name. <br><br>
Before the sun had begun to 
rise Mana, Kaede, Evangeline and Chachamaru came to take Setsuna with 
them and aid her with her preparations for the day, while others would 
come to do the same for Konoka. The day ahead of them was long and with 
a somewhat complicated schedule, and so Konoka and Setsuna each had 
a group of helpers to get them through all the necessary preparations 
on time.<br><br>
The actual marriage ceremony 
was a traditional one, held at a famous Shintô shrine where a long 
line of Konoka's ancestors had done the same, in equally full traditional 
gear. Rather than both women wearing wedding kimonos it had been agreed 
upon that Konoka wear one and Setsuna wear the male counterpart, something 
which suited her fine as Setsuna felt far more comfortable in that attire 
anyway. Konoka was calm and solemn as she waited for the ceremony to 
begin, however Setsuna had that morning been caught up by a bout of 
nerves and nearly fainted, twice, as she was led to the shrine by her 
friends. Evangeline rolled her eyes with an air of exasperation, but 
in truth she found the whole thing very amusing.<br><br>
After the ceremony it was time 
for the traditional wedding photos, where Evangeline and Asuna were 
asked to join the family on either side to honour their importance to 
the young couple, which proved a bit tricky to handle before a suitable 
camera could be enchanted that would be able to capture Evangeline's 
image. The rest of the guests headed out to the luxurious hotel that 
the Konoe clan had booked up completely for the grand three days of 
celebration, to change into less traditional festive attire, and some 
of them to put the finishing touches on the prepared second ceremony 
to be held outdoors behind the hotel.<br><br>
The second ceremony was a western 
one and performed mostly due to a specific request on Konoka's part, 
a short exchange of vows, Konoka in a simple white wedding gown and 
Setsuna in a white woman's tuxedo, followed by the exchange of rings. 
It took place in a large white pavilion decorated with flowers that 
Ayaka had personally overseen as a favour to the couple, and then the 
wedding reception was to be held out there as well. Later in the day, 
when the newlyweds took their leave the party was set to move indoors, 
where the hotel had prepared for drinking, dancing and singing for as 
long during the three days as the guests wanted. There were dining and 
swimming and various calmer and quieter forms of entertainment available 
as well, and all the guests were given rooms in the hotel for the duration.<br>
<br>
The vows were exchanged, along 
with the rings, and then sealed with a kiss which had most part of the 
gathered guests cheering and clapping. Then came dinner, with toasts 
and speeches, and the fancy multi-layered wedding cake, which one part 
of the newlywed couple in a few quick movements with a sword had managed 
to cut up in nice, even pieces for all present. A strangely stunned 
applause followed that event, until the expected cake-feeding part was 
started by Konoka. Konoka had her own ideas on how to eat her wedding 
cake, as was evident when Setsuna's dainty attempts to eat were made 
for naught by Konoka smearing her face with the frosting. Setsuna was 
not given the chance to react before her eager wife had attached herself 
to her intended task of cleaning the mess she had created... with her 
lips.<br><br>
When the time for the wedding 
waltz came most of their friends were amused to see that despite a few 
years of practice, Setsuna, though not that bad at dancing by now, still 
had to leave it to Konoka to lead. They danced several dances together, 
eventually joined by the other couples present and several girls whom 
in lieu of dates danced with their friends. <br><br>
The most eye-catching couple 
besides the newlyweds themselves proved to be Kaede and Mana, because 
they were unquestionably the best dancers, and as they swept past on 
the dance floor their matching long, tight and darkly shimmering dresses 
pulled all eyes towards them. Asuna and Ayaka also called for attention, 
though not necessarily in a good way, as Asuna had bounded over to Ayaka 
and asked her for a dance which the other woman accepted with a blush... 
only to discover in short order that they both kept trying to lead.<br>
<br>
Some time later, when the blue 
skies were slowly starting to tint towards grey, the party was still 
going strong and therefore only a small group of people noticed the 
newlywed couple preparing to make their exit. Those that did followed 
Setsuna and Konoka to the hotel doors, adding a few more well-wishes 
and congratulations, as well as a few suggestive remarks that made the 
couple rush their farewells and fairly sprint to the elevators that 
would take them up to the floor they had to themselves with the honeymoon 
suite.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
Konoka giggled as she clung 
to Setsuna's neck in the elevator. "Paru is so funny." Absently 
she fingered the buttons on Setsuna's shirt.<br><br>
Setsuna pointed at the not-so-hidden 
elevator camera and smiled wryly. "Actually I think she has been watching 
too many science-fiction shows. Break a what? And how?"<br>
<br>
"That's just how she is." 
With a content sigh Konoka leaned against her wife. "Secchan, what 
was grandpa saying to you earlier, after the dance? I saw you get all 
red before daddy dragged him off."<br><br>
"Ahh..." Setsuna chuckled 
a little at the memory. "He clapped me on the back and told me that 
I had his permission now to go ahead and work on those great-grandchildren 
he wants." Konoka's laugh echoed pleasantly in the confined space. 
"I'm still not sure what he expects me to do though."<br>
<br>
"Mmmm..." Konoka purred 
and looked mischievous. "Don't worry Secchan, I have plenty of ideas." 
She leaned in to whisper huskily in Setsuna's ear. "You know, I 
had them send up Eva-san's wedding gift earlier." <br>
<br>
That had been another moment 
of unspeakable mortification for Setsuna, as they had gotten to Evangeline's 
gift and the unsuspecting warrior had opened the lid... stared uncomprehendingly... 
and then, her face more red than a traffic light, closed the box with 
a snap. Ever curious, Konoka had grabbed the box to have a look at the 
contents herself as Setsuna helplessly continued blinking. The little 
blonde hellion had waggled her eyebrows and smirked at them, and said 
something about the item being made special just for them and carrying 
an enchantment that Setsuna in particular would come to appreciate. <br>
<br>
With her wife giggling completely 
without any trace of embarrassment Setsuna had thought herself doomed 
to more teasing, until salvation had appeared in the form of Chachamaru 
calmly informing them that the item in question was created with a technique 
that her master had created herself, causing the tiny blonde to blush 
violently as well and start screaming at her servant. Setsuna had snagged 
the box from Konoka before anyone else present decided to see for themselves 
what was in it, and hid it deeply among the other gifts.<br>
<br>
With an almost frightened look 
at her love, Setsuna wondered if she had hidden it well enough.<br>
<br>
Konoka grinned and gave her 
wife a quick kiss. "I'm just joking, Secchan."<br>
<br>
The elevator doors opened and 
Konoka stepped through but stopped to give Setsuna a look over her shoulder. 
"Or <i>am</i> I?"<br><br>
And then she was off laughing 
down the corridor with her wedding dress hiked up and Setsuna blinking 
after her for a moment, dumbfounded, before taking up the chase with 
a grin.<br><br>
"KONO-CHAN!"<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
It took a while after Setsuna 
and Konoka left the party, but eventually those that considered themselves 
in charge of the event got the party to move on over to the interior 
of the hotel. As people moved about the many rooms providing different 
kinds of entertainment there was a kind of natural separation where 
the former Mahora students drifted away from the other guests to party 
by themselves in a smaller room. Considering the sheer number of Mahora 
students present there were more than enough with them alone to keep 
a fairly decent party going, and so they did.<br><br>
Evangeline had monopolized 
a pile of pillows in spot against the wall where she had a good view 
of both ends of the strangely curving room the Mahora gang had relocated 
to, and she lay there leisurely sipping wine that Chachamaru provided 
from her spot next to her Master. Or at least those that noticed <i>
hoped</i> it was wine, since with Evangeline one could never quite be 
sure.<br><br>
As Chizuru claimed control 
over the karaoke machine in the lower end of the room, belting out some 
song or other to the cheers and whistles of Natsumi, the twins and Kuu 
Fei, the cheerleader girls jointly took possession of the self-serve 
bar at the top end and proceeded to make drink combinations which they 
then forced upon unsuspecting classmates with varied results. Evangeline 
amused herself by making quiet comments to Chachamaru regarding whom 
would pass out first from excessive partying, and whom would pay for 
it the most come morning.<br><br>
To her surprise Evangeline 
soon found herself joined by a number of her former classmates, beginning 
with Mana and Kaede that suddenly slid down to recline in a joint heap 
at Evangeline's right, glasses of something much too colourful and 
decorated in their hands. Upon their heels Haruna flopped down to Chachamaru's 
immediate left, armed with a tray filled with snacks and a deck of cards, 
smirking evilly as she arranged her treasure bags around herself.<br>
<br>
"...on my foot!" Ayaka 
and Asuna came carrying more snacks and soda to go around, busy quarrelling 
lightly with one another and not exactly paying much attention to the 
rest of the world, as usual. "Hey! It wasn't <i>my</i> fault that 
you..."<br><br>
Haruna hauled them down, making 
Asuna sit down next to her own seat and Ayaka next to the slightly cuddly 
couple. "There! Now, what do you say we play some cards while we wait 
for Kazumi and Sayo to come back with the book?"<br>
<br>
There were groans and eye-rolling 
- the last one from Evangeline - in reply to Haruna's suggestion. 
It tended to get a bit dangerous to engage the bespectacled girl in 
any game where she could claim penalties as her prize, and card games 
were something she had bamboozled far too many of her classmates into 
far too many times for anyone to take the risk. Several of the girls 
present privately shuddered at the memory of something particularly 
embarrassing or unpleasant that had been their payment to Haruna at 
some point in the past.<br><br>
"If you're waiting for 
Kazumi and Sayo you'll be waiting for a long time." Evangeline chuckled, 
holding her glass out for Chachamaru to refill. "Chachamaru and I 
spotted them dancing on a secluded balcony a while ago."<br>
<br>
Chachamaru turned her head 
to stare into nothing at a slightly odd angle. "My sensors indicate 
that my little sister is still located on the balcony. It is likely 
that Asakura-san is there also."<br><br>
"It's pretty incredible..." 
Asuna shook her head and raised a plastic cup with some orange-coloured 
soda in a salute. "You are the only one that could have come up with 
a way to give Sayo-chan a body by having her haunt a robotic one."<br>
<br>
Evangeline hid a small smile 
behind her glass, affecting an indifferent look. "Yeah, well... let's 
just say that this way paparazzi and ghost-girl owe me."<br>
<br>
Asuna smirked and put her cup 
down. "Eeeevaaa-chaaaaan!" She squealed and charged the small blonde 
to roughly muss up her hair. "Soo cute! You're just soo sweeeet 
Eeevaaa-chaaaan!"<br><br>
"GET OFFA ME, ya moron!" 
Evangeline groused and pushed the playful redhead away. "Honestly, 
no respect at all..." She grumbled some more to herself as Asuna, 
grinning at a mission accomplished, returned to her seat.<br>
<br>
"Dancing alone on a dark 
balcony?" Mana spoke mildly, ignoring the growling vampire struggling 
to get her hair back into order. "How nice to know that Asakura-san 
has a romantic side."<br><br>
"Oh?" The woman Mana was 
using for a partial arm- and backrest leaned forward slightly to catch 
her eye. "This one can find a dark balcony of our very own to dance 
on if you would like de gozaru?" The offer earned Kaede a small kiss 
and a look full of promise for later.<br><br>
"Oho? Let's all just hope 
this hotel has lots of sound-proofing on their rooms, if that look is 
anything to go by." Haruna teased, winking at the reclining couple 
across from her. "Unlike the dorms."<br><br>
Mana gave Haruna a faintly 
amused look. "I'm afraid you must be mistaking us for some <i>other</i> 
couple from our old class. Kaede and I are never... loud."<br>
<br>
"Nin-nin."<br>
<br>
"Oh god! You guys just had 
to remind me, didn't you?" Asuna complained loudly, covering her 
eyes. "Have you any idea what it was like living next-door to those 
two? There's a reason they got an entire floor booked all to themselves, 
let me tell you that!"<br><br>
The other women laughed softly 
and Asuna continued. "I swear it just took a couple of days after 
they moved in together before the ‘oh god Secchan yes yes!' started 
up... I'm scarred for life! Not to mention poor Negi."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I think we've all 
had our share of evidence to Konoka and Setsuna's... friskiness." 
Haruna grinned and stirred her drink with a straw. "But it got better 
once Negi taught them the silencing spell, right?"<br>
<br>
Asuna nodded and flipped herself 
until she lay flat on her pillow, unaware that in doing so she was somewhat 
flashing the blushing blonde sitting directly opposite her.<br>
<br>
Ayaka cleared her throat and 
tried to look away. "Speaking of Negi-san, does anyone know where 
he went? I think I lost track of him somewhere during the dancing."<br>
<br>
"Negi-bozu and his girlfriend 
went for a walk outside de gozaru."<br><br>
"Aa... Negi is so grown up 
now." Asuna sighed forlornly. "Baby brother is all grown up." 
She wiped at her eyes and, after a moment, sat up, walked over to the 
pillow next to Ayaka, pulled it closer and finally flopped herself down 
on it with her head in Ayaka's lap. "Little baby Negi is all grown 
up, Ayaka!"<br><br>
Asuna sniffled into Ayaka's 
lap, and the tall blonde unexpectedly providing the pillow blushed deeply 
but still patted the weepy redhead soothingly. She shared a sheepish 
look with the others.<br><br>
"I guess Asuna is a bit more 
drunk than I thought she was." Evangeline said slowly, a bit surprised 
by the outburst. "Who is sharing their hotel-room with her?"<br>
<br>
"That would be me." Ayaka 
said, looking even more awkward but never ceasing to stroke the head 
in her lap. Concentrating on Asuna she never saw the sympathetic looks 
sent her way.<br><br>
"Ah, alright. We'll help 
you get her to your room later on, then." Mentally Evangeline added 
Asuna to her list of hangover victims. She sighed a little, having hoped 
the redhead would have a bit more sense than getting herself plastered 
like the rest of the children.<br><br>
A movement at the door caught 
the girls' attention, as in came a grinning Kazumi and a shyly smiling 
Sayo holding hands and also waving a white leather-bound volume around.<br>
<br>
"Finally!" Evangeline made 
a gesture of feigned impatience. "What took you two so long?" <br>
<br>
Kazumi smiled and indicated 
the white scrapbook as she and Sayo sat down in Asuna's abandoned 
seat. "We have printed the wedding pictures, Evangeline-san." Sayo 
replied with a soft cheerful voice.<br><br>
"Little sister, you should 
not try to deceive Master." Chachamaru reprimanded mildly, causing 
Sayo to look confused.<br><br>
Evangeline smirked evilly at 
the new arrivals. "Yes, I see... it must have taken so much time to 
print those digital pictures out there on the dark balcony."<br>
<br>
Kazumi grinned sheepishly and 
put a hand behind her head as if to say ‘ah, you found out', but 
otherwise did not care. Sayo however blushed and apologized to Chachamaru 
and Evangeline both.<br><br>
"I am sorry Evangeline-san, 
Chachamaru... -ane." The white-haired girl hesitated, still not used 
to Chachamaru's determination that she was now her younger sister 
due to the nature of her physical form. At least Chachamaru had ceased 
insisting that Sayo address Evangeline as ‘Master' as well. "It 
wasn't my intention to deceive you."<br><br>
Taking Sayo's hand Kazumi 
interrupted, not liking it when anything made Sayo sad or uncomfortable. 
"Hey, did you guys want to see the book or what?"  She held 
it out so the others could crowd around it for a better look.<br>
<br>
The white leather-bound scrapbook 
was a joint wedding gift for Konoka and Setsuna from several of their 
friends, and would be delivered to the newlyweds in the morning as the 
last of the wedding pictures would not be ready until then. It had pictures 
of Konoka and Setsuna together as small children, though pictures of 
Setsuna had been hard to find, more as they were at Mahora, including 
pictures taken at their omiai, before and after their first date - 
Asuna had been sneaky - their engagement and various other pictures, 
up until their wedding. The official wedding picture would go into a 
special compartment at the front, and the pictures Kazumi had taken 
decorated several pages inside the album. A third of the book was empty, 
leaving space, Kazumi explained, for future anniversaries and children.<br>
<br>
There was some fussing over 
the cuteness of Konoka and Setsuna as children and some amused reminiscing 
over the pictures of the school years, both before and after the engagement, 
until finally everyone had their little laughs over both cute and funny 
wedding and wedding-reception pictures.<br><br>
"So..." Haruna looked at 
Mana and Kaede. "When will it be your turn at this?"<br>
<br>
Kaede laughed softly. "We 
are not in quite as much of a hurry as these two." Mana leaned into 
her lover slightly. "Your answer would be: when we feel it should, 
I think."<br><br>
She turned to Evangeline with 
an unreadable look on her face. "When you mention Setsuna and Konoka 
having children, do you mean the usual, like adoption, or have you and 
the others found a viable means for Setsuna and Konoka to conceive?"<br>
<br>
Evangeline smiled somewhat 
evilly and leaned back. "We believe we have. Why, are you interested 
in having a... <i>go</i> at it?"<br><br>
Leaning back into her lover's 
arms, Mana and Kaede shared a look. Then Kaede grinned even wider than 
usual. "Nin-nin! We would, in due time de gozaru."<br>
<br>
The evil grin grew wider. "Oh 
goody, I'll have some time to come up with a... <i>suitable</i>... 
form of payment before then in that case."<br><br>
"You are so kind, Master."<br>
<br>
"Chachamaru!" Evangeline 
sighed deeply as the rest of the girls laughed. <i>She got no respect 
at all these days.</i><br><br>
--- <br><br>
The party carried on for its 
assigned three days of merriment and festivity, complete with a few 
ohmygod-we-did-WHAT-last-night<WBR>?! moments, although the happily married 
couple chose not to join the rest of the world until the third day, 
to much amusement among their friends. It was quite a success, until 
of course the fourth day when there was much crying as first Negi and 
his family had to take their flight back to Wales - with promises 
of return visits of course - and then when many of the girls formerly 
of Mahora had their respective flights or trains to take. <br>
<br>
A core group remained in Kyoto 
for a while longer, consisting of Evangeline, Chachamaru, Sayo, Kazumi, 
Mana, Kaede and Ayaka. In Evangeline's case she was set and determined 
to enjoy her full week of vacation from Mahora, leaving the other women 
that travelled to Kyoto with her to stay the rest of the days as well, 
though no-one was complaining about that. It was never stated, and no-one 
chose to potentially embarrass her by asking, just why Ayaka stayed 
along with the rest of them, but the general assumption was that she 
wanted to spend a little more time with Asuna.<br><br>
Asuna had after finishing school 
found herself without any clear direction to go in or a place to stay, 
but found that her connection to the Konoe family did not end once she 
was supposedly an adult. Konoka and Setsuna considered Asuna family, 
and so when the couple moved to Kyoto Asuna was asked to come with them, 
given her own small residence on the vast estate. It took quite a while 
before Asuna caved in, still having issues about being a burden to anyone, 
and it wasn't until she was taken into the Konoe family's employ 
that she could finally accept the offer and the home that was cleverly 
disguised in her contract as a work-related perk. <br>
<br>
Thus it was that Asuna was 
going to take up residence in Kyoto now that she had come for the wedding, 
and it was generally suspected that Ayaka was somewhat heartbroken by 
the concept of being so far away from her friend. And if anyone thought 
there might be something else besides that behind Ayaka's sadness, 
they at least did not say so to her face.<br><br>
Before they knew it the week 
was over, and the women still living in the Mahora area left for their 
homes, leaving their friends in Kyoto with promises to visit or be visited 
often. Konoka and Setsuna were given another couple of weeks of concentrating 
on nothing else but enjoying their new life as a married couple, then 
it was back to school for both of them.<br><br>
The difference was that this 
kind of school was far more important and serious than their years at 
Mahora. Konoka was to learn her craft and learn it well, just as Setsuna 
was to not only learn to improve herself as the warrior that protected 
Konoka, but as Konoka's permanent pactio partner as well, and beyond 
that they both had a lot to learn that would concern their future as 
the leaders of the united Magical Associations. Asuna was also to some 
degree put in schooling, to improve her skills as a warrior but also 
to subtly train her to become Setsuna and Konoka's aide. It was a 
process that would take many years.<br><br>
Not quite four years later 
saw a different kind of frantic but eagerly awaited activity in Kyoto. 
It was at that time Setsuna and Konoka's first child was to be born.<br>
<br>
For Setsuna the whole event 
was a blur that passed by fairly quickly, since the warrior went almost 
into hysterics from the moment it was clear that Konoka was going into 
labour, and because Chachamaru managed to give the hyper-ventilating 
woman several electric shocks in attempt to calm her down, before Evangeline 
noticed and made her servant stop electrocuting the soon-to-be parent. 
For Konoka the labour was fairly long, though she was told it was a 
normal-length for such a thing, and not without anxiety or pain though 
those in the end were quite negligible.<br><br>
Evangeline, whom had worked 
quite a bit to make it so that she would have a few days of Kyoto vacation 
right when Konoka was expecting to give birth, proved to be quite helpful 
for Konoka as the rest of the family ran around in a panic. The tiny 
blonde was as calm as ever and even managed to shake some semblance 
of self-control back into Konoka's wife, just in time for Setsuna 
to be present and holding her wife as their child was born. It was with 
quite a bit of satisfaction that Evangeline snatched the newborn away 
from the midwife to present her to the stunned parents by herself.<br>
<br>
The method Evangeline and the 
others had devised to make Setsuna and Konoka able to have children 
together was deemed a great success, as the healthy bouncing baby was 
a perfect combination of her two mothers: she had healthy rosy cheeks, 
a cap of midnight black hair, brown eyes, and, something which was discovered 
the first time she was bathed, a pair of tiny going-to-be-wings protrusions 
in her back, smooth and pink as the feathers had yet to grow in. Naturally, 
both parents were instantly smitten by their little miracle, the very 
world revolving around her. What was more surprising was how the small 
and imperious blonde took an instant liking to the new life, though 
of course Evangeline refused to admit it.<br><br>
When the little one was a month 
old it was time to officially give her a name. Of course her parents 
had long since agreed upon Kimiko, but they had a little surprise in 
store for the guest that was summoned there for the day especially.<br>
<br>
Thinking herself left alone 
with the baby for the moment, the otherwise reserved vampire walked 
over to the crib and the bubbling bundle and poked at her slightly. 
The child gurgled happily and focused chocolate brown eyes in Evangeline's 
direction, the blonde tickling chubby cheeks and round feet in hopes 
of seeing one of those toothless grins that she very privately thought 
were adorable but would not admit to under pain of torture.<br>
<br>
Konoka spoke up from the doorway 
where she had stood for a moment, watching while Evangeline was too 
caught up by the baby to notice. "We're so glad you could come, 
Eva-san. Secchan and I couldn't imagine doing this without you here."<br>
<br>
The child-like immortal snatched 
her hand away from the baby and looked away, trying to hide suddenly 
blushing cheeks. "Y-yeah? Well, it's another day's vacation from 
Mahora for me."<br><br>
Konoka grinned and suppressed 
an urge to go over and hug Evangeline, knowing that her diminutive on 
and off teacher would not appreciate the gesture. Instead she walked 
over to stand next to Evangeline, looking down at her baby girl. "I 
had intended to wait until Secchan was here for this, but... Eva-san, 
Secchan and I have talked about this and we intend to do something a 
bit unusual when it comes to Kimiko's name."<br><br>
Mildly interested despite herself 
Evangeline glanced at Konoka. "Oh?"<br><br>
"Secchan and I have decided 
to have a second ceremony here at home later today, in which we would 
like to give Kimiko a western-style middle name." Konoka smiled and 
kept her eyes on Evangeline who subtly shrugged and looked back at the 
infant.<br><br>
"With your permission we 
would like to give our daughter the middle name Angela... in honour 
of her very important aunt."<br><br>
The blonde gave a start, and 
with an for her uncommon wide-eyed look of astonishment stared at the 
child in the crib. She tried to wrap her mind around the other woman's 
words and the meaning behind them. "You... want to... name her... 
after <i>me</i>?"<br><br>
"If you approve, Eva-san, 
then yes... we do." Konoka said gently, detecting a tell-tale gleam 
in Evangeline's eyes, one that she felt fairly sure she had never 
witnessed before.<br><br>
Evangeline felt her eyes sting 
with tears like she hadn't allowed them to for a very long time. Abruptly 
she turned her back on both mother and child and tried to grunt something 
abrasive, as though she couldn't care less, but in reality she only 
managed a slightly broken grunt that Konoka could easily see through.<br>
<br>
"Eva-san, could you please 
keep an eye on Kimichan for a little while? I'll be right back." 
Konoka tried not to let her smile be heard and quickly eased out of 
the room, just around the corner from the door really, discreetly peeking 
at the blonde that had her back towards her.<br><br>
When she thought herself alone 
with the child Evangeline wiped a treacherous tear away and turned back 
to the little bundle that was good-naturedly watching her surroundings 
without complaint. Very, very carefully, with hands that were strong 
and sure but felt like trembling a little, Evangeline lifted the baby 
to take a closer look.<br><br>
"Hello Angela." She whispered, 
blinking another stray tear away as the baby gurgled happily, not objecting 
to be held by the small blonde person.<br><br>
Slowly and equally carefully 
Evangeline angled the baby in her arms until she rested with her cheek 
against the downy top of the little one that was contently chewing her 
hand and drooling. A rare happy smile found its way to Evangeline's 
face.<br><br>
"When you're older..." 
She whispered to the baby as if making a secret promise just between 
them. "I'll teach you how to fly." She rocked the baby a little. 
"Yeah... when you're older, let's fly together... <i>Angela</i>."<br>
