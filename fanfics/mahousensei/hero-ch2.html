<h1>Hero (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/hero-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Take off your T-shirt, Set-chan,&quot; Konoka smiled from
the nearby pool, her long black hair flowing, &quot;I want
to see your swimsuit.&quot;

&quot;My lady, I.....,&quot; Setsuna blushed, tugging down the
over sized shirt she wore.

&quot;Please?&quot; Konoka pouted just a little.

Setsuna met her eyes, her expression visibly
softening. &quot;All right,&quot; she sighed and gracefully
pulled the shirt up and off.

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Negi dropped his cup of tea from where the
three of them were sitting in the shade of a large
umbrella.

There are bikini&#39;s that are chaste and modest,
designed to hide one&#39;s form. There are even bikini&#39;s
that make a woman look dumpy and out of shape. This,
however, wasn&#39;t one of them. The bikini top was two
small squares of cloth and string, barely holding
Setsuna back, and the bottoms were only barely decent.
It looked more like something one would wear for a
bedroom romp rather than out in a pool.

&quot;Oh, Set-chan!&quot; Konoka squealed.

&quot;Konoka,&quot; Setsuna blushed, looking away.

&#39;Thank god for distractions,&#39; Ayaka thought as Asuna
pulled away from her fever-check. Her heart was still
racing wildly, but she hoped with a moment she could
regain her self control. She cleared her throat, &quot;I&#39;m
quite surprised she&#39;d wear that.&quot;

&quot;Never underestimate the power of a girl&#39;s love,&quot;
ASuna said, looking at Ayaka with concern. &quot;You don&#39;t
seem feverish,&quot; she noted.

&quot;Tho she is awfully red,&quot; Negi noted.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Ayaka waved it off as casually as
possible. Clearing her throat she asked, &quot;Negi, would
you like some drinks?&quot;

&quot;That would be nice,&quot; Negi admitted, &quot;it is kind of
hot.&quot;

Akira paused by the diving board, the swimmers black
hair flowing, then gracefully leapt into the water
like a seal. With a simple, efficient motion she cut
through the water, racing across then back with
incredible speed.

&quot;Remind me not to bet against her again,&quot; Chisame
noted, passing the money over.

Sakurako smirked, &quot;Teach you to play with the big
boys.&quot;

Chisame scowled, &quot;Next time I&#39;m voting for
Chachamaru.&quot;

Asuna watched Ayaka walk away, trying not to notice
how good the woman looked in the sexy swimsuit she
wore. Almost as soon as they had arrived she had felt
her heart thump in her chest as she saw the glossy
black cloth that clung to Ayaka&#39;s skin.

&#39;Thank god she&#39;s hung up on Negi,&#39; Asuna silently
noted, &#39;she&#39;ll never notice.&#39;

Negi looked at her worriedly, &quot;Asuna, does Ayaka seem
distracted to you?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; Asuna admitted.

&quot;Do you think I should try to talk to her?&quot; Negi
wondered.

Asuna sighed, knowing that it was probably Ayaka
thinking of doing something indecent to Negi again.
&quot;I&#39;ll try talking to her,&quot; she offered reluctantly,
&quot;it might be better if she talked to a classmate
rather than a teacher.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Asuna,&quot; Negi beamed. 

&#39;Still such a innocent,&#39; Asuna sighed.

Makie pouted as the gymnast sat on the side of the
pool kicking her legs. &quot;I wish they wouldn&#39;t hog
Negi-kun like that.&quot;

&quot;But Makie,&quot; Nodoka blushed charmingly.

Yue nodded firmly, &quot;You need to spend more time with
him, or your romantic chances will be shot.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t we wait till they finish talking,&quot; Kaede
suggested, the taller ninja-girl looking amused, &quot;then
borrow Negi-bozo for a while?&quot;

&quot;Great idea,&quot; Makie beamed.

&quot;Are you sure we should....?&quot; Nodoka asked hopefully.

&quot;No one will mind,&quot; Yue nodded firmly as she silently
continued, &#39;and I&#39;d like to spend some more time with
Negi too.&#39;

Ayaka felt a bit more steady as she returned to the
table carrying a pitcher of juice and cups. &#39;I just
wish Asuna had worn a plain suit,&#39; she thought as she
tried not to look at the girl&#39;s shapely body, &#39;it&#39;s
not making my self control any easier.&#39;

&quot;About time,&quot; Asuna smirked.

&quot;Freshly prepared,&quot; Ayaka sniffed, &quot;unlike some
people I prefer quality.&quot;

Asuna guiltily found herself watching as Ayaka set
the tray down, bending so that she could nearly see
the full curves of her breasts. &#39;What am I doing?&#39;
Asuna made herself look away, even though what she
wanted to do was look closer.

&quot;Thank you, Ayaka-san,&quot; Negi smiled sweetly as Ayaka
poured him a glass.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, sensei,&quot; Ayaka responded. Part of
her wished she was still infatuated with the boy, but
all she felt was the fondness of a surrogate little
brother.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Yue said to them in her usual flat tone,
the smaller girl having marched up to their table.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Asuna and Ayaka turned to look.

&quot;Nin nin,&quot; Kaede, dressed in full ninja gear picked
Negi up and carried him off while the two were
distracted.

&quot;Wha....?&quot; Negi managed.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; mission accomplished Yue turned to go.

&quot;We&#39;ve just been had,&quot; Asuna sounded amused as she
pointed out the girls taking off with Negi to Ayaka.

&quot;Do you think we should rescue him?&quot; Ayaka asked a
bit nervously as Negi was tossed into the water with
the young ladies.

&quot;He&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Asuna laughed as she saw them
beginning a splash fight. &quot;Besides,&quot; she looked back
to catch Ayaka gazing at her, &quot;it&#39;ll give us a chance
to talk.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ayaka asked. She tried to sound casual but
there was something dangerously knowing in Asuna&#39;s
beautiful mismatched eyes. 

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that,&quot; Asuna said firmly, &quot;we&#39;ve known
each other way too long.&quot; Softening her tone she
reached out to take Ayaka&#39;s hand, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Ayaka tried not to groan as she felt Asuna&#39;s gentle
touch on her hand. Part of her wanted to lie, but she
knew Asuna would be able to tell. &quot;It&#39;s complicated,&quot;
she sighed, knowing that anyone could see them sitting
out by the pool side.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Asuna said as she got up, tugging Ayaka to
her feet. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got some new treasure to
boast about,&quot; she noted as they walked into the house.

&quot;I&#39;m certain I can find something,&quot; Ayaka noted.
Several classmates raced by in maid uniforms and she
yelled, &quot;Put those back when you&#39;re done!&quot; 

&quot;Spoil sport,&quot; Fumia pouted.

Her twin Fuka shrugged, &quot;Let&#39;s go change, then we&#39;ll
ride the banisters again.&quot;

&quot;If we want any privacy we&#39;re going to have to your
room,&quot; Asuna noted, trying not to think of where that
could lead.

Ayaka wanted to protest, but she knew Asuna was
right. &quot;Come on, then,&quot; Ayaka said as they walked the
halls, occasionally scolding a classmate or two.

&quot;So,&quot; Asuna said as they walked in the large bedroom,
closing the door behind them, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; 

The door clicked shut and Ayaka gulped. &quot;I....&quot; she
debated lying, but felt certain that Asuna would see
through that. &quot;I dreamed about you last night,&quot; she
confessed.

&quot;Really?&quot; Asuna looked surprised.

Mustering her courage Ayaka stood close to Asuna,
&quot;You rescued my from monsters, walked up to me
and....?&quot;

Asuna gulped, feeling her heart beat faster from
Ayaka being so close, fighting the urge to reach out
and stroke her hair. &quot;Any?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;You did this,&quot; Ayaka leaned forward, threw caution
to the winds and kissed Asuna gently. She drew back
after a moment, Asuna moved forward and continued the
kiss with surprising eagerness. 

&quot;Took you long enough,:&quot; Asuna said breathlessly as
her arms gently circled Ayaka, &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that
for awhile.&quot;

&quot;So why didn&#39;t you, baka?&quot; Ayaka shot back, holding
onto her strong shoulders.

&quot;You were fawning over Negi all the time,&quot; Asuna
reminded her.

&quot;It was a good excuse to see you,&quot; Ayaka admitted.

&quot;Baka,&quot; Ayaka repeated.

&quot;Lolita,&quot; Asuna shot back.

&quot;So, we&#39;re going to continue to fight?&quot; Ayaka asked,
feeling fascinated by the red flush to Asuna&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Asuna shot back, &quot;but first, kiss me
again.&quot;

Never one to deny a reasonable request, Ayaka did.

Notes: I&#39;m not quite sure how credible this is but it
WAS fun to write. Inspired by Ryuchan&#39;s fics over on
mahora-academy.net&#39;s forums, especially the A&amp;A
moments in Tenderness.
