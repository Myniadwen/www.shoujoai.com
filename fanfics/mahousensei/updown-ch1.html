<h1>Upside Down Memories</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors Notes: This is my first attempt at writing a Negima Fic, so 
please, go easy on me ok? 
 
 

&quot;There. I&#39;m finished now Set-chan.&quot; Said Konoka from her bunk, 
signalling that she had finished changing into her Pajama&#39;s. Setsuna, 
who was already in her pajama&#39;s, was on the bunk above Konoka. Negi and 
Asuna having left already for Evangeline&#39;s for some weekend training. 
Konoka decided that it would be a good chance to have her lovely 
Set-chan to herself for a few days, without any distractions. 

&quot;Did you want something to eat Set-chan? You haven&#39;t eaten since lunch, 
and I&#39;m starting to worry about you.&quot; 

&quot;No. I&#39;m fine Ojou-sama.&quot;  

Konoka peered her head over the top bunk as she heard Setsuna&#39;s tummy 
contradict her earlier statement. Her face turned Tomato red as Konoka 
fell back onto her bed and tried in vain to surpress her laughter. 

&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you blush Set-chan!&quot; 

Konoka surpressed a yawn and said she would get right to work on fixing 
a snack. 

&quot;If you&#39;re tired Ojou-sama, I can make us something to eat.&quot; 

&quot;I told you not to call me that Set-chan. Just call me Kono-chan ok?&quot; 

&quot;Sorry Ojo... I mean Ko..Kono... I&#39;m sorry I just can&#39;t do it! It sounds 
too im-proper to me.&quot; 

Konoka let out a sigh before coming up with something to say. 

&quot;If you call me Ojou-sama one more time, you&#39;re going to regret it. 
Understand me?&quot; 

Setsuna&#39;s blush dissapeared as she became as serious as she could. 

&quot;Yes Konoka-san.&quot; She said bowing as low as she could. 

Konoka shrugged her shoulders and sighed again as she got up and headed 
for the kitchen.  

Konoka sat across from Setsuna and kept on looking at her the whole time 
they were eating, which obviously made Setsuna very uncomfortable. 
Konoka picked up a small piece of the cake they were sharing with her 
fork and held it out for Setsuna to eat. Even though Konoka looking at 
her was uncomfortable, she didn&#39;t mind being fed by her. Each time she 
looked at her and took a bite, she felt butterflies in her stomach, even 
though they had been in love for some time now. Konoka put the dishes 
away as Setsuna laid down on Asuna&#39;s bunk and relaxed. When she was 
finished, Konoka sat down on her bed and let out a sad sigh as she 
pulled her knees up to her chest. Setsuna hooked her legs on the 
railings of the top bunk, hung upside down, and was going to ask if she 
was allright. But when she did, her shirt slid down and covered her 
face. 

&quot;Ahh! I can&#39;t see!&quot; She said struggling in vain to lift her shirt from 
her eyes. 

Konoka laughed when she saw this and reached over to help. She undid one 
of the buttons of the shirt so Setsuna could poke her head through. 

&quot;Thank You Ojou-sama.&quot; 

The smile on Konoka&#39;s face dissapeared when she heard that name. She 
smiled sadly at Setsuna and said: 

&quot;I thought I told you not to call me that. You realize now, that I&#39;m 
going to have to give you a punishment.&quot; 

&quot;Ye... yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;  

Konoka stood up and told Setsuna to stay there and that she would be 
right back. While she was waiting, Setsuna&#39;s mind drifted back to some 
rather unpleasant times when she was a child. 

&#39;Flashback&#39; 

She stood up after what had to be about the 10th time she fell to the 
ground in agony after a long day of training. Her feet were raw and 
bloddy from walking on the hard ground all day, she was covered in mud 
and dirt, and her clothes were full of holes and tears. She propped 
herself up on her Kendo stick and slowly made her way back home through 
the relentless downpour that had started only moments earlier. As she 
rounded a corner, she lost her balance and fell hard to the ground. She 
looked up only to see her father angrily looking down at her. He grabbed 
her hand and held her up in the air to look her over. When his eyes came 
to her feet, he became furious and slapped her hard across the face, 
causing her to cry, which resulted in 2 more hard slaps. He dropped her 
to the ground and told her to stand up. With all her stregnth, she 
managed to stand, only to be grabbed roughly by the arm and dragged 
home. That wasn&#39;t the end however. When they got home, her father beat 
her severely with her Kendo stick until she had almost passed out from 
the pain. 

&#39;Flashback End&#39; 

Tears stung her eyes as Setsuna remembered that that was the day she 
realized that she was indeed in love with her beloved Ojou-sama and that 
she loved her back. 

&#39;Flashback&#39; 

&quot;Set-chan... Set-chan? Did you want to come out and play?&quot; Asked Konoka 
as she entered Setsuna&#39;s room. She turned around to see a bloody and 
beaten Setsuna laying on top of her Futon, trying not move as it was far 
too painful. Konoka&#39;s knees grew weak and tears filled her eyes as she 
ran to her best friends side. 

&quot;Set-chan!! Set-chan!! What happened!?&quot; 

Konoka&#39;s eyes moved up and down Setsuna&#39;s body, trying to find each and 
every wound and trying to figure out the best way to treat them. 

&quot;I&#39;ll go get your father. I&#39;ll be right back Set-chan.&quot; 

She was stopped by Setsuna grabbing the back of her skirt. She looked 
back to see a very frightened look on her friends face. Setsuna pulled 
Konoka closer and hoarsely whispered into her ear that it was her father 
that did this to her. Konoka backed away in disbelief and wondered how 
any father could do that to his daughter, let alone Set-chan! Konoka 
steeled her resolve that she would never let him hurt her Set-chan again 
and helped Setsuna to her feet. 

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;To my place, where you&#39;ll be safe.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t! If he catches me there looking like this he&#39;ll kill me!!&quot; 

&quot;No he won&#39;t! I&#39;m never going to let him hurt you again! I promise.&quot; 

Setsuna tried to argue with her, but her body gave out and she slumped 
un-consious in Konoka&#39;s grip. Konoka gathered up all her stregnth and 
walked as quickly as she could to her home to help her dear friend. As 
she neared the top of the stairs, a maid came in and noticed what was 
happening. 

&quot;Princess! Please, let me carry her.&quot; 

&quot;No. I&#39;ll be fine. But could you please get me the First Aid Kit and 
bring it to my room?&quot; 

&quot;Right away Ma&#39;am.&quot; With that, the maid rushed off to do what she was 
asked. 

Konoka opened her bedroom door and made her way over to her bed where 
she gently laid the young Samurai down and started cleaning her facial 
wounds. Setsuna awoke to feel Konoka&#39;s gentle hands on her swollen face. 

&quot;Ojou-sama?&quot; 

&quot;Shhhh. It&#39;s ok Set-chan, just relax. Try not to talk.&quot; 

&quot;Ojou-sama... It hurts so much.&quot; Said Setsuna as tears rolled down her 
fiercely swollen and bruised cheeks. 

Konoka brushed some hair from Setsuna&#39;s eyes and placed a gentle kiss on 
her forehead. She started to undress Setsuna to try and treat any more 
injuries that she might have. She gently removed her shirt, gasping at 
all of the marks and bruises covering her body. She was about to remove 
her shorts when she felt something warm and wet on the bed under her. 
She removed her fingers and saw nothing but red. Konoka gasped and 
slowly turned her onto her stomach to see numerous marks on her back and 
blood seeping through her shorts.  

&quot;Oh no... please no!&quot; Konoka thought the worst when she saw that. She 
grabbed a pillow and placed it under Setsuna&#39;s hips. She reached up and 
was going to remove her shorts when Setsuana begged her to stop. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Set-chan... but I have to. I have to stop the bleeding. I&#39;ll 
be as gentle as I can.&quot; 

Setsuna tensed and moaned in pain as Konoka slowly pulled down her 
shorts, exposing her swollen, raw backside. The blows her father 
inflicted were mostly to her back, but they caused much more damage to 
the soft flesh of her bottom .  

&quot;I begged him and begged him to stop, but he said that I deserved alot 
worse than what he was going to give me.&quot; 

Konoka pulled out a large gauze pad and sprayed it with Antiseptic. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Set-chan, but this is going to hurt.&quot; 

Setsuna nodded and Konoka placed the pad on her bottom. A loud, 
Agonizing scream filled the Mansion and Konoka&#39;s father ran to her 
daughters room to see if she was alright. 

&quot;Konoka? Are you allright?&quot; He said as he burst through the door. Konoka 
was just placing another gauze pad on Setsuna&#39;s lower back, another cry 
of pain coming from the young Samurai. 

&quot;What happened Konoka?&quot; Asked her father as he walked over to his 
daughter. Konoka ran over and hugged his legs tightly, sobbing heavily. 
He crouched down and picked up his daughter in a warm embrace as she 
buried her face in his chest and continued crying. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok sweetie. Please don&#39;t cry.&quot; 

He walked over to the bed to examine her wounds more closely. Konoka 
turned around in her fathers arms to look as well, her eyes filling with 
tears once more at the sight of her friend in so much pain. He put 
Konoka down and she sat on the bed next to Setsuna. She put her hand on 
a small part of her back that had no marks on it and softly rubbed it. 
Setsuna had passed out again, and was now asleep. She stirred, and 
whimpered in pain as she tried to get comfortable. 

&quot;Daddy? I need you to do me a favor.&quot; 

&quot;Anything my Princess.&quot; 

&quot;I want to talk to Set-chan&#39;s father.&quot; 

&quot;But... why? What for?&quot; 

&quot;Please? I NEED to talk to him.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Turning to one of the servants, he asked: &quot;Will you please bring 
this girls father to the house at once.&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir. Shall I have him wait in the living room?&quot; 

&quot;Konoka, darling?&quot; 

&quot;That will be fine. Thank You very much.&quot; 

About half an hour later, Setsuna&#39;s father was nervously standing in the 
spacious living room wondering why he was called there. He heard the 
doors behind him open and turned to see Konoka walking into the room, 
covered in blood. 

&quot;Princess Konoka! Are you alright?&quot; He asked as he hurried towards her. 
She put up her hand to stop him. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine. This isn&#39;t my blood.&quot; 

He looked at her quizically as he asked who&#39;s it was. 

&quot;This blood belongs to your daughter. How could you do such a thing to 
her?&quot; 

&quot;She deserved alot worse than what she got princess.&quot; 

&quot;But you are her father! Father&#39;s are supposed to love and to cherish 
their daughters! Not beat them!&quot; 

He snickered at Konoka&#39;s comments and asked her where Setsuna was. 

&quot;She&#39;s asleep upstairs. But you are not to go anywhere near her. I will 
not allow you to hurt her anymore!&quot; 

Tears flowed down her cheeks as she let out her feelings.  

&quot;You don&#39;t deserve to call yourself a father! You&#39;re Cruel, Un-caring, 
and Heartless! You should&#39;ve never been a father in the first place!&quot; 

&quot;As of this moment, we here at the Konoe Estate are taking full custody 
of Setsuna Sakurazaki.&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t do that!! She is mine!!&quot; 

&quot;You speak as though she is a piece of property, not a human girl.&quot; 

&quot;Ha. She&#39;s nothing but a worthless half-breed piece of garbage.&quot; 

Konoka&#39;s eyes narrowed and she shot him an angry glare as her heart 
nearly broke under his harsh tongue. 

&quot;I will do what is best for her, because I love her with all of my 
heart. I want you to leave this place and never come back. If you 
contact us in any way, shape, or form, you will be handed over to the 
Authorities for Child Abuse, and I&#39;ll see to it personally that you 
recieve the maximum penalty.&quot; 

&quot;Guards!!&quot; 

Four rather large men dressed all in black and carrying automatic 
weapons entered the room and stood at attention in front of Konoka. 

&quot;Yes Princess?&quot; 

&quot;Please escort Sakurazaki-san back to his residence so he can pack his 
personal belongings. After which, you are to drive him to the Airport.&quot; 

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am. Right Away.&quot; They all said and bowed to her respectively. 

&quot;Can you give my daughter a message for me? Tell her that she is a 
worthless half-breed undeserving of human or demon companionship and 
love. She will never amount to anything, she is too weak.&quot; 

With those last hurtful words, he left, leaving a devastated and sobbing 
Konoka standing in the middle of the room. Konoka&#39;s father overheard 
their conversation and came in as soon as Sakurazaki-san had left so he 
could comfort his little girl. He crouched down to her level and hugged 
her tightly.  

&quot;How could a father hate his own daughter like that?&quot; She asked sobbing. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure sweetie. All I know is that you had better get upstairs as 
soon as you can. Sakura... I mean Set-chan is awake and she&#39;s asking for 
you.&quot; 

Konoka looked up in surprise as her father wiped away her tears. She 
gave him another hug and bolted upstairs to be with her dear Set-chan. 
Konoka entered the room just as one of the servants was helping Setsuna 
get dressed. 

&quot;Thank You very much.&quot; Said Setsuna as she did up the last few buttons 
of her shirt. 

Konoka ran to her side and was going to glomp her when she remembered 
how much pain Setsuna was in only a little while ago. 

&quot;Are you ok Set-chan? How are you feeling?&quot; 

&quot;Better. Thank You Ojou-sama.&quot; Said Setsuna as she tried to get out of 
bed. 

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t. You need to rest. Lay back down and relax.&quot; Konoka 
said as she helped her friend back down. She took Setsuna&#39;s hand in both 
of hers and looked into her eyes. 

&quot;Set-chan... I spoke with your father.&quot; 

Setsuna&#39;s eyes grew wide with fear when she heard those words. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve seen to it that he&#39;ll never hurt you again. As of 
today, all of us here have taken full custody of you. You are now part 
of our family Set-chan. I hope that in time you will grow to love us as 
we love you.&quot; 

Setsuna looked up at Konoka with a fierce blush on her face and managed 
to stammer out a Thank You, before taking a few deep breaths to gather 
her thoughts and compose herself. 

&quot;Ojou-sama... I...&quot; 

Not knowing what to say, she leaned forward and kissed Konoka lightly on 
the lips. Konoka made no effort to pull away after a few seconds, so 
Setsuna deepened the kiss even more and gently placed her hand on the 
back of Konoka&#39;s neck. The two girls pulled away and Setsuna looked into 
the eyes of her Princess. 

&quot;Ojou-sama... I love you. I love you with all of my heart. I want to be 
with you for the rest of my life and I want to protect you... even if 
that means giving up my life to do it.&quot; 

&quot;No. I won&#39;t let you. I won&#39;t let you sacrifice yourself for me. I don&#39;t 
ever want to lose you Set-chan.&quot; 

&#39;Flashback End&#39; 

Setsuna was brought back to reality by the sound of Konoka coming out of 
the bathroom. She came out and saw Setsuna still hanging upside down 
where she had left her. With a sigh, Konoka sat back down on her bed and 
looked up at her sweet Set-chan. 

&quot;Now. As for your Punishment young lady.&quot;  

Konoka reached up, and Setsuna closed her eyes to prepare herself for 
any type of pain that she was about to endure. Konoka put her hands on 
Setsuna&#39;s ribs... and started tickling her! 

&quot;Ah-ha, ah-ha, no. Please stop! please! Ha, ha! Ah-ha, ah-ha!&quot; 

&quot;No way! I told you I was going to punish you and that&#39;s exactly what 
I&#39;m doing!&quot;  

&quot;Please. Ah-ha, ah-ha! I&#39;m sorry! Ah-ha! I&#39;m sorry Kono-chan! Please 
stop! Ah-ha!&quot; 

Konoka stopped, much to the relief of Setsuna who thought she was going 
to wet herself if she had to endure anymore of that unbearable torture. 
Konoka leaned over and kissed Setsuna passionately on the lips. 

&quot;I love you Set-chan.&quot; 

&quot;I love you too Kono-chan.&quot; 

&quot;Can I get down now?&quot; 

&quot;Not just yet. I haven&#39;t given you you&#39;re REAL Punishment yet.&quot; Said 
Konoka as she slowly started to take off Setsuna&#39;s shirt. 

Anybody that wants a clean ending: STOP HERE!!

---------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who aren&#39;t offended by these two making love: Please! 
Keep reading!! 

She kissed her passionately again as she slid her hand along her smooth 
stomach and around her back to un-clasp her bra. Once she had it off, 
she suckled like a baby on Setsuna&#39;s left breast, getting a few small 
gasps from her in response. She flicked her tongue across her nipple and 
blew on it, smiling as she watched it harden into a cherry pink nub. 
With her right hand, she gently started massaging Setsuna&#39;s right 
breast, while slowly travelling up her abdomen with her left, ending up 
inside her Pink silken Panties. Setsuna gasped when she felt Konoka&#39;s 
fingers gently rubbing her entrance. She squirmed as she felt the heat 
building up between her legs. 

&quot;Let&#39;s get you down from there. I don&#39;t want you passing out before I&#39;m 
finished Punishing you.&quot; Said Konoka as she stood up and un-tangled 
Setsuna&#39;s legs from the top bunk. Setsuna decided to help by pushing off 
the bed, but instead of helping, she landed right on top of Konoka on 
the floor. 

&quot;Well, I suppose this place is as good as any.&quot;  

This time it was Setsuna&#39;s turn to give her lover a kiss on her sweet, 
soft lips. Konoka broke the kiss and shifted her weight, flipping 
Setsuna onto her back. She gazed lovingly at her before continuing where 
she left off. She slid her left hand back into Setsuna&#39;s Panties and 
carefully slipped two fingers inside of her. Konoka loved teasing 
Setsuna whenever they made love. She would always send to the edge and 
stop just before she came.  

&quot;Kono-chan...&quot;  

Konoka stopped and brought her hand up to her mouth. Setsuna watched in 
excitement as she seductively licked each one of her fingers clean. She 
grabbed both of Setsuna&#39;s breasts and massaged them gently, while 
pinching her nipples now and again for a little extra pleasure. 

&quot;Kono-chan... please.&quot; 

Konoka leaned down and gently kissed her neck and chest. She slowly made 
her way down Setsuna&#39;s lean stomach until she reached her Pajama 
bottoms. 

&quot;Set-chan... Lift your hips a bit.&quot; 

Setsuna did and Konoka slowly slid her P.J&#39;s and her Panties down until 
they were around her ankles. She made sure to kiss every square inch of 
both of her legs as she made her way back up to Setsuna&#39;s lovely 
womanhood. She used her thumbs to spread her petals and took a deep 
breath, relishing the sweet smell of her lover and her already flowing 
juices. Setsuna quickly felt the heat between her legs rising again as 
Konoka&#39;s fingers were sliding up and down in her folds, teasing her 
before penetrating inside. Setsuna gasped in surprise and delight when 
she felt Konoka&#39;s tongue inside her instead, brushing against her pearl 
every now and again which made Setsuna cry out with pleasure. Konoka 
decided that she had teased her long enough and placed her lips around 
the little nub to finally give her lover release. It didn&#39;t take long 
before Setsuna was rocked by one of the best Orgasam&#39;s she&#39;d ever had. 
Konoka slid up so that she was eye level with Setsuna and kissed her on 
the cheek. 

&quot;So? Have you learned your lesson?&quot; 

Out of breath, Setsuna said: &quot;Maaaaaybe.&quot;       
 

                                  THE END. 

A/N: Well? What did you think? I debated for days on whether or not to 
turn it into a lemon at the end. I kind of did and yet I didn&#39;t, so I 
decided to do both. That way, those who wanted a clean ending got what 
they wanted, and those that wanted a Lemon also got what they wanted. 
Please, let me know what you think!! </pre>
