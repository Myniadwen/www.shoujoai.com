<h1>Now and Then</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a>

<pre>Mana Tatsumiya looked down at her, the dusky skinned miko&#39;s expression 
faintly amused as she continued &quot;...not only to guard her body, but her 
heart.&quot;

&quot;Her heart?&quot; Setsuna echoed, the black haired young woman looking up at 
Konoka only to see her nod happily. Then suddenly she felt a falling 
sensation, the images sliding away...

...and Setsuna awoke, blinking as she looked up at the ceiling while the 
morning sound of birds chirping was heard off in the distance. Sitting 
up she blushed her wildly messy black hair back and murmured, &quot;What was 
that all about?&quot;

Not much later that morning she met Asuna and Konoka as they all went to 
school, almost unconsciously slipping her hand into Konoka&#39;s as they 
raced to class. &quot;Good morning, m&#39;lady,&quot; Setsuna smiled shyly as she 
nodded, &quot;Asuna, Negi-sensei.&quot;

&quot;Set-chan,&quot; Konoka scolded the other girl gently, &quot;you don&#39;t need to 
call me that any more.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Setsuna blushed in pleasure.

Studying Konoka covertly Setsuna tried to figure out where the powerful 
vision had come from. She was certain that they hadn&#39;t had a 
conversation like that before, yet the vision had felt incredibly real 
to her. It was almost as if it was something that she had forgotten and 
was now pushing to be remembered.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Setsuna-san?&quot; Negi Springfield asked, the red haired 
little boy keeping pace with them all easily. Despite being only ten he 
was their teacher and also a good friend, someone they had all come to 
trust deeply. Secretly, he was also a magician, though his ability at 
keeping that hidden was rather limited.

&quot;Just,&quot; Setsuna hesitated before saying, &quot;some strange dreams.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Asuna asked, oddly looking just a little guilty. Her long orange 
hair fell in two streams from her head, the bells she wore as hair clips 
ringing softly as they ran.

&quot;It&#39;s probably nothing,&quot; Setsuna said as casually as she could, &quot;but 
Negi, could I talk to you about it later?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Negi nodded promptly, &quot;I&#39;d be glad to help.&quot;

Settling down into class Setsuna tried her best to concentrate on her 
lessons, but she found her mind wandering oddly. At one point she began 
to draw casually, sketching in a image of Konoka and without consciously 
intending to she dressed Konoka in a lovely white robe, graceful fans in 
each of her hands.

During a break Konoka walked over, her eyes widening as she saw the 
drawing. &quot;It&#39;s lovely,&quot; she murmured, &quot;only...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Setsuna asked curiously.

Konoka touched the sheet of paper, her eyes remote as if she was 
remembering something, &quot;You should be there, too, with your sword and... 
angel wings.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s head snapped up to look at Konoka, their eyes wide as they 
look at each other. &quot;You saw it, too?&quot; she asked softly.

Konoka nodded weakly, &quot;Yes, but... how?&quot;

Setsuna frowned down at the paper, straining her mind to find any more 
pieces of the strange visions. &quot;I think,&quot; she finally sighed, &quot;we&#39;d best 
talk to Negi-sensei.&quot;

Later that day the two of them went back to Konoka and Asuna&#39;s dorm 
room, the whole group eventually sitting down around a table drinking 
tea. Setsuna calmly filled them in what she remembered, Konoka listening 
intently to every word. &quot;Does that match what you remember?&quot; Setsuna 
asked her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Konoka promptly replied, &quot;but my memory starts a bit earlier. A 
demon had taken your sword, and I rushed to your side.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Negi murmured, eyes wide behind his glasses.

&quot;I told you I would protect you,&quot; Konoka blushed faintly as she 
continued, &quot;that I wanted us to protect each other.&quot;

Setsuna reached out to take her hand, &quot;That feels right, somehow.&quot;

&quot;So you don&#39;t remember actually having the conversation,&quot; Negi blinked 
thoughtfully, &quot;but both of you dreamed of it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Konoka nodded.

Asuna was studying both of them intently, &quot;And you don&#39;t remember 
anything else?&quot; When both of them shook their heads no she sat back with 
a frown.

&quot;Does this sound familiar, Aniki?&quot; Chamo asked, the white ferret sitting 
up on the table.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Negi admitted, &quot;I may have read about this somewhere.&quot; He 
brightened, &quot;Or I could ask the headmaster or Takamichi!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to do that,&quot; Asuna said with a sigh, &quot;I know why they&#39;re 
having visions.&quot;

&quot;Asuna-chan?&quot; Konoka looked over at her in surprise.

&quot;Stupid headmaster said it wasn&#39;t likely to happen,&quot; Asuna muttered 
under her breath. Taking a deep breath she looked around at them 
searchingly as she explained, &quot;None of you remember it but you all took 
a trip into the past and saved my life... but in the process you changed 
history so you didn&#39;t have to go back in the first place.&quot;

&quot;Dwa?&quot; both Setsuna and Konoka looked at her blankly.

&quot;Time shadows,&quot; Negi blinked, his eyes wide.

&quot;That&#39;s what the headmaster said after I asked him about it,&quot; Asuna 
looked apologetic. She looked mildly headachy, &quot;Basically the memories 
of what your other selves experienced are still out there in some 
potential form... and eventually reached you now, causing the visions.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a quote from headmaster, right Asuna-anesan?&quot; Chamo guessed 
accurately.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Asuna agreed. She frowned suddenly and asked him, &quot;What, were 
you thinking I couldn&#39;t sound that smart?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Chamo said, quickly ducking behind Negi for 
protection.

Konoka and Setsuna exchanged a long look then Setsuna softly asked them, 
&quot;So what happened in the visions really happened?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Negi nodded, &quot;to a alternate version of you, at least.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Negi, Asuna,&quot; Konoka smiled at the two of them then took 
Setsuna&#39;s hand. &quot;Do you want to take a walk?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Setsuna agreed, the two heading out together.

&quot;I wonder what that&#39;s about?&quot; Negi asked innocently, not seeing both 
Asuna and Chamo exchanged amused glances.

&quot;You&#39;ll find out eventually,&quot; Chamo finally chuckled.

Setsuna and Konoka went out from the dorms, eventually standing beneath 
the starry night sky. The breeze stirred the tree branches as they 
hesitated, looking at each other searchingly. &quot;I meant it,&quot; Konoka said 
softly, &quot;I want to be your partner, if you&#39;ll let me.&quot;

&quot;Nothing would make me happier,&quot; Setsuna took her hands in hers.

Konoka squeezed her fingers gently, &quot;And more than partners?&quot;

Setsuna reached out to cup Konoka&#39;s chin, leaning forward to press her 
lips gently to hers in answer. &quot;Together,&quot; she said happily, &quot;and I 
won&#39;t let anything separate us again, m&#39;lady.&quot;

Konoka kissed her again, then slapped her on the shoulder lightly. 
&quot;Kono-chan,&quot; she reminded her, &quot;when am I going to get you trained?&quot;

&quot;It could take a while,&quot; Setsuna hugged Konoka close, &quot;but we have 
time.&quot;

End.

Notes: While I liked the ending of Negima on one hand, the resolution of 
the time travel storyline also erased a very neat romantic moment 
between Konoka and Setsuna. This fic is my attempt to bring that back 
into the plotline, as well as setting up a plot thread I could use 
later. Hopefully I got everyone&#39;s personality right, but if not let me 
know.</pre>
