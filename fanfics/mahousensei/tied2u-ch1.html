<pre>Admin Note: Minor corrections by Nutzoide.

A slight warning: I still haven&#39;t done more than glanced at the manga 
and I haven&#39;t even seen all of the anime (unfortunately), either way I&#39;m 
sure Konoemon is out of character here to say the least. Just... nod and 
smile, nod and smile. XP  
 
----------------------------------------

For an individual born with wings on her person, regardless how hidden 
at the moment, Setsuna suspected it was quite strange how well she could 
sometimes do fish impressions. Like right then and there for example, 
standing in front of her employer in his office, what kind of attitude 
was that for a warrior like herself? The fact that her precious 
Konoka-ojousama was even more visibly surprised was of little comfort, 
after all, Setsuna&#39;s precious ojousama was not only entitled any 
emotional response she darn well pleased, she was also incredibly cute 
while enacting them. 

Shaking her head slightly to disentangle her thoughts from further 
speculations regarding Konoe Konoka and her many virtues, Setsuna got 
her composure back and levelled a narrow-eyed gaze at the old man 
patiently waiting for her response with eyes far too calculating for 
Setsuna&#39;s tastes. 

&quot;You want ojousama and I to cancel our Pactio contracts with Negi-sensei 
effective immediately, is that correct sir?&quot; 

The old man nodded and let his valuating gaze move between both young 
women standing in front of his desk. &quot;Yes that is about what I said, 
Setsuna-kun... although you and my grandchild will have until morning to 
see to it that your Pactio contracts are properly ended.&quot; His smile was 
friendly, if brief, but for some reason it was even less assuring than 
his words to the young Shinmeiryuu warrior. &quot;If you are concerned about 
Negi&#39;s feelings, don&#39;t be. He has already been informed and is quite 
understanding of your situation.&quot; 

&quot;Our situation, grandpa?&quot; Konoka looked every bit as confused as she 
sounded, causing Setsuna to look away from Konoemon to instead attempt 
to gauge her Konoka-ojousama&#39;s feelings. After all, Setsuna knew that 
her ojousama was quite attached to their young teacher, though exactly 
how far that attachment went... Setsuna had willed herself not to 
speculate. 

&quot;Yes, you see Konoka, there are several reasons why you cannot be 
allowed to remain in Pactio with Negi.&quot; The old man stroked his beard 
absently. &quot;For one, now that you are aware of your heritage and power 
your own education in the mystical arts awaits you, and as such you are 
not allowed to form a Pactio with another mage.&quot; A peculiar look passed 
on the wizened face for a moment. &quot;Then of course there is the fact that 
Negi himself has quite a bit of his education left to undergo, 
particularly since the traditions and proprieties surrounding the Pactio 
act, and the inherent dangers of having too many Pactio contracts at one 
time, have somehow failed to be included in his studies so far.&quot; 

Konoemon sighed and brushed a hand over his eyes, muttering something 
indistinctly that to Setsuna&#39;s ears sounded like a comment about Negi 
Pactio-kissing his way through all of Mahora. Grimacing slightly she 
could not help but agree, though her own fondness and respect for the 
child-teacher prevented her from ever saying such a thing out loud. 

&quot;I see...&quot; Konoka spoke up, head tilted to the side in a thoughtful pose 
that pulled at Setsuna&#39;s heart. &quot;But what about Secchan?&quot; 

With a jolt Setsuna&#39;s attention refocused on her employer, meeting that 
shrewd gaze evenly. When no answer was forthcoming a cold sensation 
settled in the pit of her stomach, and the realisation came to her. 

&quot;You question my loyalty...&quot; Setsuna ground out slowly, the words spoken 
with quiet intensity that, although vibrating with strain, held only the 
barest trace of the icy horror Setsuna felt as the knowledge settled 
into her very bones. &quot;You question my loyalty to Konoka-ojousama.&quot; 

Never had her loyalty and devotion to Konoka ever been questioned by 
those that knew her, not by her employer, not by her masters and 
teachers in the Shinmeiryuu, never by anyone that in any way knew the 
person called Sakurazaki Setsuna. Never.  

Her grip on Yuunagi tightened as a cold, detached part of Setsuna&#39;s mind 
decided on a location, a nice spot some distance into the woods of 
Mahora from where she could see the school that housed her precious 
ojousama in the distance. Yes, that would serve well, it would be a good 
place to end things had she failed her ojousama that miserably, and the 
carrion-feeders of the forest would take care of what remained... after. 

&quot;We do not so much question your loyalty, Setsuna-kun, as we are forced 
to acknowledge that there is a... strong conflict of interest if you 
will.&quot; Konoemon appeared to be choosing his words carefully, but his 
countenance was as stern and unforgiving as Setsuna&#39;s whitened features 
were stoic. &quot;The person Eishun and I entrust with Konoka&#39;s wellbeing 
will have to, now more than ever, be bound to her and her alone. To have 
secondary concerns, no matter how much they have not conflicted until 
this point, simply cannot be allowed anymore.&quot; 

As the new direction the conversation was going finally caught up to 
Konoka she glomped onto her Secchan&#39;s arm and turned a furious and 
downright incendiary look towards her elderly grandfather. Whatever 
impassioned protest was about to leave her lips Konoemon simply 
overruled it with a silencing gesture and ignored her in order to 
continue his conversation with the silent warrior. 

&quot;The person who will serve as Konoka&#39;s bodyguard will from now on also 
have to be her companion, her partner and her guide. This person will 
have to devote herself to Konoka&#39;s studies as well as her welfare, and 
of course not have any concerns or distractions outside of Konoka 
herself.&quot; A tiny pause for effect, a cheap trick perhaps, but still a 
good way to drive his words home Konoemon thought. &quot;This person will be 
bound to Konoka in a Pactio.&quot; 

Again ignoring his granddaughter&#39;s attempts at protesting Konoemon 
gentled his appearance and his voice, trying to convey the sincerity of 
what he was about to say. &quot;Truthfully I and Eishun would both prefer 
that you accepted this task, Setsuna-kun. Neither of us can think of 
anyone more qualified, nor better suited.&quot; 

&quot;M-me?&quot; Setsuna&#39;s face went from white to bright red in record time, and 
she would have started flailing her arms in a most un-warrior-like 
fashion had not the now happily squealing Konoe heiress gone from simply 
glomping her arm to enthusiastically glomping all of Setsuna. &quot;B-but...&quot; 

&quot;Please...&quot; Konoemon bestowed a kind look upon the flustered girl. &quot;I 
ask only that you consider your answer very carefully before you give 
it.&quot; A breath. &quot;I am well aware that it is a lot to ask, and no-one will 
think any less of you if you decline, Setsuna-kun.&quot; 

&quot;If you find that what we ask is beyond you, you are free to continue 
attending this school, keeping your contract to Negi if that is your 
wish, although Konoka will no longer be your responsibility. You may 
also choose to return to Kyoto, to continue your Shinmeiryuu studies 
there.&quot; 

&quot;It will be hard, no doubt...&quot; A rather theatrical sigh, but Konoemon&#39;s 
audience was too emotional to give it much thought. &quot;Finding a warrior 
of your strength and calibre... with a good and honourable 
personality... decent magical skills without being a mage... loyal and 
trustworthy enough for Konoka...&quot; 

&quot;Aa, I fear it shall be difficult indeed, Eishun will have to go over 
his best warriors to find a suitable candidate.&quot; The old man turned away 
so the mischievous glint in his eyes would not give him away. &quot;I suppose 
in the interim Tatsumiya Mana could, for a reasonable monetary 
compensation, be persuaded to enter a temporary Pactio with Konoka.&quot;  

Ignoring the horrified gasps that replaced the wordless stuttering 
behind him the old man continued. &quot;If need be we can have Konoka change 
temporary Pactio contracts at any time, should the candidates we find 
prove to be unsuitable, but really, one steady, skilled and reliable 
warrior would be so much better. After all, Konoka will need a solid 
Pactio partner for not only her remaining years at Mahora, but also the 
following years when she will study the mystical arts... that alone will 
take years, easily way into marrying age I should think.&quot;  

&quot;NO! Err, I-I mean...&quot; Setsuna yelped, trying not to - and failing - to 
imagine her precious ojousama forced to kiss not only Mana but a whole 
long line of warriors, warriors that undoubtedly would be of 
questionable character and whom would volunteer merely for the chance at 
stealing a kiss from such divine lips. &quot;NO! I CANNOT ALLOW SUCH LOW ACTS 
TOWARDS OJOUSAMA!&quot; 

&quot;Oh Secchan!&quot; Konoka squealed again, happily bouncing and hugging her 
warrior, all at once. &quot;You will take the Pactio with me then? I&#39;m so 
happy!&quot; 

Seeing that the young warrior blushed fiercely and appeared to be on the 
verge of stuttering out all kinds of protests, most of them no more than 
instinctive attempts at denial rather than her true intentions, Konoemon 
cut in. &quot;Now Konoka, Setsuna-kun has not given her answer yet, and if 
she does not feel up to the sacrifice that devoting a large portion of 
her future solely to you, then that is something you will have to 
respect.&quot; Now if he knew his young employee as well as he thought he 
did, these comments would be the final straw that landed his grandchild 
the only protector he could imagine for the role. &quot;Setsuna-kun might 
wish to pursue her own goals and desires, her own life, and we cannot 
begrudge her that even if she is by far the superior choice as your 
protector.&quot; 

Her own goals and desires? Not being by Konoka&#39;s side? Setsuna&#39;s mind 
raced and, finally, rebelled. Standing by Konoka&#39;s side, in whatever 
form or shape she was allowed, WAS Setsuna&#39;s goal in life! Konoka was 
her reason for living! Perhaps it was time to prove that. 

Looking at Konoka&#39;s smiling face however reminded Setsuna that there was 
something else, something far more important than proving her 
dedication. She nodded imperceptibly to herself. &quot;Ojousama, what do you 
wish to do? The choice is yours.&quot; 

Beaming brightly Konoka wrapped her arms a fraction tighter around 
Setsuna&#39;s neck, leaning in until she was almost close enough to kiss 
right there and making her blushing protector feel inexplicably weak in 
the knees suddenly. &quot;Oh but I want to! Please Secchan...&quot; 

&quot;Be mine!&quot; 

Konoemon coughed into his fist, barely believing his ears. Had his 
grandchild just proposed marriage to her best friend? It had certainly 
sounded like it to him... and as he cast a glance at the entangled pair 
it was easy to see that he was not the only one that found Konoka&#39;s 
words a bit... more than the girl had probably intended. Poor Setsuna 
was blushing so hard he could almost feel the heat hit him from the 
other side of his desk. The only one that apparently found nothing 
strange in her choice of words was Konoka herself, as she was happily 
content to hang tightly onto her warrior, arms wound tight around 
Setsuna&#39;s neck and her body flush with the other girl&#39;s side, making 
Setsuna hold onto her to keep her upright. 

&quot;B-b-but o-ojousama! A-are you s-sure?&quot; 

&quot;Oh yes!&quot; Konoka nodded enthusiastically. &quot;You&#39;re the only one I want, 
Secchan!&quot; 

Merciful heavens! Konoemon groaned quietly, thankful that neither girl 
was paying him the slightest attention right now. Was Konoka doing this 
on purpose? Or was it perhaps his fault, should he had made sure that 
Konoka understood that no matter how lengthy a period they were 
envisioning for Setsuna&#39;s Pactio, it was still a temporary Pactio and 
not a permanent one? 

Silently watching Setsuna stutter and blush while Konoka bounced and 
looked as if she had been given the best present ever, it occurred to 
Konoemon that he had never questioned just why Konoka and Setsuna were 
so very devoted to one another despite being apart for so long. He had 
never given it much thought before, but why exactly was it that Konoka 
had been heartbroken when Setsuna appeared to avoid her... it wasn&#39;t as 
if his grandchild had any lack of friends, good, close friends at that. 
Similarly, why exactly was it that no-one could ever question that 
Setsuna would most willingly tear out her very heart from her chest if 
Konoka asked her to? 

Was it an old man&#39;s imagination? Was he reading things into a deep and 
sincere friendship that wasn&#39;t truly there? Konoemon didn&#39;t know, and 
for right that moment, he wasn&#39;t sure how he felt about that. If nothing 
else it would certainly explain his otherwise so well-behaved... well, 
mostly well-behaved... granddaughter&#39;s behaviour every time he arranged 
for an omiai. 

He narrowed his eyes at the two girls, noting that they were winding 
down and it was about time for him to step in again. This new matter 
would have to wait until he had sent them on their way and he could call 
Eishun about it. 

&quot;Well Setsuna-kun, although I don&#39;t want to rush your decision, do you 
have an answer for us?&quot; 

The young Shinmeiryuu warrior nodded with a shyness that was 
uncharacteristic for her usual behaviour in Konoemon&#39;s office, taking a 
small step forward and away from Konoka although their hands remained 
clasped. &quot;Yes sir! If you and Konoka-ojousama are sure... then I would 
be honoured to be ojousama&#39;s Pactio partner.&quot;  

That said Setsuna bowed deeply, not lifting her head until Konoemon 
chuckled a little, internally congratulating himself on the success of 
his mission. And to think that Eishun had tried to suggest that Konoemon 
lacked in subtlety for such an undertaking! 

&quot;On behalf of myself and Konoka&#39;s father I thank you, Setsuna-kun... we 
will both be relieved to know that Konoka is in good, trustworthy hands. 
Truly, we couldn&#39;t have wished for a better protector for Konoka.&quot; 

Smiling kindly in response to the beaming grin from Konoka and the still 
shy little smile from Setsuna Konoemon made shooing gestures towards the 
doors. &quot;How about you go see Negi about the cancellation of your current 
contracts now, and then relax for tonight. Tomorrow evening we will hold 
your Pactio ritual, and before that I think we will have to go over some 
room arrangements to have the two of you closer together.&quot; He shooed 
them again. &quot;Now go, go!&quot; 

After the doors had closed behind the two girls Konoemon made his way 
back behind his desk, sat down and reached for the ornate phone resting 
on it. Who to call first? While he needed to speak to Eishun about his 
observations there was still much to arrange for tomorrow, so that would 
have to wait. 

With quite the evil smirk on his face, Konoemon dialled the number that 
would get him in contact with Evangeline. 

---------------  

Morning came much too soon for one Shinmeiryuu warrior that was really 
just starting to realize what she had agreed to. Oh the standing by her 
ojousama through whatever may come, devoting her life and her time to 
her, that part was easy and certainly nothing new to Setsuna. That had 
always been her intention, after all. 

No, the part that loomed in Setsuna&#39;s mind and made her movements 
increasingly stiff as the day progressed was the fact that she had 
agreed to kiss Konoka. She, Sakurazaki Setsuna! Not only was it expected 
of her, she was actually encouraged to do so, by everyone... feeling 
somewhat panicky Setsuna could not help but think that there was 
something very wrong about the concept and how lightly everyone else 
seemed to take it. Maybe Setsuna was at heart a hopelessly old-fashioned 
girl, as she rather thought things like kissing was supposed to be a 
private thing, brought about by various romantic reasons... the Pactio 
kiss she was about to share with the girl she so adored would have none 
of these things, in fact they would apparently have quite the audience. 
Not to mention that Setsuna was torn between feeling guilty because she 
secretly very much wanted to kiss Konoka, and a deep sense of fear that 
she would do something wrong and her secret would be out. 

What if her ojousama hated her afterwards? 

Konoka of course showed no sign of any kind of trepidation, rather the 
reverse as she seemed exited and eager. The happy heiress had chatted 
endlessly after the two of them had returned to Konoka&#39;s shared dorm 
room the previous night, mercifully keeping her rattled warrior from 
having to say too much. Setsuna had of course made sure to thank Negi 
properly during the surprisingly simple yet, for all three of them, 
emotional cancellation of their Pactio contracts with him. The four of 
them, Setsuna, Konoka, Negi and Asuna, had made new, personal vows of 
mutual support and protection even without a Pactio, and Setsuna had 
felt humbled by the strength of the friendship and even kinship that had 
grown between them all. 

They had all stayed up talking rather late, in fact it was not until 
Negi fell asleep sitting up that the girls decided to call it a night 
and Setsuna returned to her own room. Konoka&#39;s warm hug goodnight had 
returned the blush to pale cheeks, and in all honesty Setsuna had walked 
to her room and prepared for the night purely on habit, as all her 
thoughts were too occupied with her ojousama to actually take note of 
her surroundings. It wasn&#39;t until she tossed and turned in bed, unable 
to sleep, that she became self-aware enough to use a meditation 
technique to calm herself enough for sleep. 

Even though Setsuna was normally a very early riser, that particular 
morning she was woken up quite rudely by a deviously grinning vampire 
and her typically deadpan companion, and with that Evangeline had simply 
taken over Setsuna&#39;s entire morning. She had been ordered to pack up her 
things and move to another room, and knowing the futility of disobeying 
the imperious blonde Setsuna had done just that, thankful once again 
that she had little in the way of possessions outside of her assorted 
weapons. 

The new room had proved to be a large one, one of those intended for 
three or four occupants although Evangeline had, with a smirk and an 
insinuating quirk of her brow, declared that only Setsuna and Konoka 
would share that room. True to the vampire&#39;s word, as soon as Setsuna 
had put her things away to Evangeline&#39;s satisfaction, she had been 
directed to help her ojousama move all of her belongings to the new room 
as well. Thankfully the room was far closer to Konoka&#39;s old one than 
Setsuna&#39;s, as the Konoe heiress had more than enough possessions tucked 
away to make up for Setsuna&#39;s apparent lack thereof. 

With the exception for the usual breaks for food, most of the day had 
been filled with moving, arranging furniture and decorating, all of 
which left Setsuna at least mostly too preoccupied to give in to her 
increasing sense of panic. All too soon though all three rooms were in 
order, and in the one that was from that point onward supposed to be 
hers and Konoka&#39;s, a large open space had been left to accommodate for 
the Pactio circle. It was only a matter of waiting for Konoka&#39;s father 
and grandfather to arrive with Chamo. 

When Konoka began fluttering around with Asuna doing various strange 
things that, when asked, she called &#39;prettying herself&#39; in preparation 
for the Pactio, Setsuna was ready to either faint or vibrate through the 
floorboards. Fortunately Evangeline and Chachamaru had flanked Setsuna 
earlier, and were able to take care of the suddenly green-faced and 
hyper-ventilating girl until it was time. 

So it was that Setsuna found herself kneeling on the floor, blushing of 
course, in front of a smiling and eager-looking Konoka in the middle of 
a magical circle, while their audience had crammed themselves along the 
wall next to the door. 

Knowing the tingling sensation in her scalp was a fair warning sign that 
she might actually pass out soon, Setsuna did her level best to ignore 
all the people watching. That Eishun and Konoemon were present she could 
almost understand, though the mortification threatened to kill her, but 
why Evangeline, Chachamaru, Negi and Asuna had to be present as well was 
beyond her. 

Trying hard not to hear Asuna get all emotional and wipe a bit at her 
eyes over by the door, Setsuna instead concentrated on her ojousama, 
fighting to keep her demeanour as calm as possible while discreetly 
wiping her suddenly clammy hands on her pants. Aa, but could there ever 
be anything as beautiful and breathtaking as Konoka-ojousama? 

&quot;Ojousama, if I should pass out during the ceremony... please do not be 
offended.&quot; Setsuna whispered nervously, feeling the need to warn Konoka 
just in case. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Secchan...&quot; Konoka smiled lovingly and took Setsuna&#39;s 
hands into her own. &quot;You won&#39;t.&quot; 

Taking the clasped hands as his cue Chamo finished the preparations and 
started up the Pactio circle. The mystical flames ignited, and with them 
Setsuna and Konoka. 

All thoughts of people watching or lingering insecurities were drowned 
out in the loud roar of blood in Setsuna&#39;s ears, and the rapid beating 
of her heart. The universe narrowed down to the girl in front of her, 
and with that, finally, Setsuna leaned in to meet Konoka halfway. 

Their first kiss was soft, gentle, the barest pressing of lips and 
nothing more, yet it meant the world. A soft gasp from Konoka followed 
it, and then they were kissing again, firmer and more animatedly this 
time. 

Although the girls inside the circle did not notice it, the other people 
in the room watched in shock as the eldritch flames that made up the 
Pactio symbols flared up high, completely obscuring the kissing couple 
from view. All that Setsuna and Konoka knew was the mounting need to be 
closer, to kiss even deeper, hold tighter, to touch... amidst this 
feverish need a new sensation called for attention, strong and 
maddening. 

For just a moment Setsuna and Konoka drew back from their kiss, if ever 
so slightly, and Setsuna realized they were floating in the air, Konoka 
straddling Setsuna&#39;s lap and both of them holding onto the other as 
tightly as at all possible. That Konoka&#39;s eyes were glowing was a detail 
Setsuna would not recall until much later, for that moment in time all 
she really knew was that as she looked at her flushed and wide-eyed 
love, Konoka threw her head back and cried out in pleasure. A heartbeat 
later and Setsuna joined her, the pressure inside becoming a blinding 
white light on the inside of her eyelids, and then... 

The world went dark and silent. 

---------------  

The magical flames snuffed out instantly as the two girls sagged back 
down to the floor, no trace of chalk or soot or anything else for that 
matter remaining to indicate the Pactio circle had ever been present. As 
Asuna dashed across the floor to anxiously try to wake her unconscious 
friends, the magic-wielders present remained unmoving and silent for a 
long moment. 

Finally Evangeline stepped forward and with an unreadable expression on 
her face bent down to pick something up from the floor. Absently, as if 
she wasn&#39;t really aware that she was speaking to the girl, she stopped 
Asuna&#39;s mounting panic when the tall redhead could not manage to wake 
her friends. &quot;Easy, let them sleep... they&#39;re not hurt, they just had a 
magical overload to their systems and need to rest for a while. 
Chachamaru, help Asuna put them in bed.&quot; 

&quot;W-what was that?&quot; Negi sounded for once very much like the small child 
he really was, looking to the adults for reassurance. &quot;T-that wasn&#39;t a 
Pactio... was it?&quot; 

Eishun put a calming hand on the boy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;No, Negi-kun... that 
certainly wasn&#39;t a temporary Pactio.&quot; 

Evangeline snorted as she inspected the card she had picked up. &quot;Heh, 
trust those two to find a way to turn a temporary Pactio into a 
permanent one without actually performing the ritual for the latter.&quot; 
Abruptly she handed the card to Konoemon and crossed her arms over her 
chest. &quot;Any ideas on how this happened?&quot; 

After another moment of silence Chamo spoke up from the floor. &quot;I&#39;ve 
heard that if two people that enter a temporary Pactio are one another&#39;s 
true love, then it can become a permanent...&quot; 

A derisive wave cut him off. &quot;I&#39;ve never believed in that stuff, and 
I&#39;ve certainly never seen anything to suggest it could happen.&quot; Belying 
her gruff words there was a tiny, barely visible smile on Evangeline&#39;s 
lips as she glanced over at the sleeping girls. &quot;Could it have something 
to do with Konoka&#39;s massive and untapped power?&quot; 

She couldn&#39;t resist the urge to roll her eyes at Negi&#39;s smitten look 
that told them all quite clearly which theory he would be supporting. 
The boy really was a sucker for all romantic things, no matter how 
inane... and no matter how ignorant he was on the subject. A glance at 
Asuna&#39;s wide, pleased grin and slight blush confirmed that she, too, was 
all for the love-angle. In fact, vampire-enhanced ears easily caught the 
whispered &quot;I knew it!&quot; that accompanied the nod and the continued 
grinning, drawing yet another amused smirk on childlike features. 

This one and that one, everyone were closeted romantics it seemed, and 
all of them favouring a coupling between Setsuna and Konoka. Ah well, 
Evangeline couldn&#39;t say she didn&#39;t do so as well, nor that she wouldn&#39;t 
poke a lot of fun at those two over all of this, eventually. 

&quot;Wow... so this is what a Permanent Pactio card looks like?&quot; The Pactio 
card had passed over to Negi for inspection and Asuna had joined him, 
both of them watching the glowing card in awe. 

&quot;Only if the ones in the Pactio bond are exceptionally strong.&quot; Eishun 
told them, a small smile playing on his lips as well. &quot;Exceptionally 
strong and... exceptionally, ah, strongly connected.&quot; 

Konoemon did not look entirely pleased by his son-in-law&#39;s statement but 
he didn&#39;t contradict him. Instead he nodded slowly to whatever thoughts 
had been going through his mind, and turned towards the door. &quot;We will 
have to investigate this thoroughly, but for right now let us leave the 
children to sleep in peace.&quot; 

With her hands tucked behind her head and a nonchalant air to her 
Evangeline had to get in a few last ribs on the subject. &quot;Aren&#39;t ya 
happy old man? You&#39;ve been trying to marry off your grandkid for some 
time, and now you&#39;ve finally met your future granddaughter-in-law. You 
should be pleased.&quot; They moved out of range before Konoemon&#39;s reply 
could be heard, Chachamaru trailing along dutifully behind her master. 

Eishun took the card from Negi and placed it on the small bedside table, 
took a moment to write a short message to his daughter on a note next to 
it, and then lovingly tucked the edges of the blanket tighter around the 
sleeping girls before walking away. Negi scooped up Chamo and joined 
him, only Asuna lingered a little when everyone had left. 

&quot;I&#39;m happy for you.&quot; She smiled down at her oblivious friends, then 
glanced again at the card. Still feeling a bit in awe Asuna shook her 
head and couldn&#39;t help but voice her thoughts out loud. &quot;That really is 
amazing. All glowing and solid and... real... in a way that makes our 
other Pactio cards look like something cut out of the back of a cereal 
box.&quot; 

With another shake of her head Asuna walked over to turn out the lights 
and close the door behind her. 

In the bed Konoka snuggled just a fraction closer in Setsuna&#39;s arms, 
both of them with sleepy smiles on their lips and with hands clasped in 
a loving hold. On the bedside table the card glowed softly, its image of 
Setsuna as a proud winged and armoured knight patiently waiting for the 
joyful squeals that would follow it being discovered by one of the two 
young women whose bond it symbolized.  

----------------------  

Waking up had never been so sweet. Setsuna wanted to resist 
consciousness for once, to continue resting in this warm and happy place 
she had found, but there was something equally tempting pulling at her 
from the waking world. 

As she stirred she became aware of the warm, solid presence of her 
Konoka-ojousama, head tucked in under Setsuna&#39;s chin and her body 
fitting so well into Setsuna&#39;s arms. Strands of dark brown hair tickled 
at Setsuna&#39;s nose and she breathed in deep... ahh, ojousama smelled 
heavenly as always. A soft giggle against her collarbone revealed what 
Konoka thought of that, and the long hug that followed made it quite 
clear that Setsuna&#39;s little princess was quite awake. 

They drew apart just enough to see one another. 

*Good morning.* 

*Good morning, Konochan.* 

The fact that neither of them had spoken out loud was lost in the 
enjoyment of the mutual smile. Setsuna&#39;s heart was just full to brimming 
with the love she felt for this beautiful girl with her happy smile and 
cute blush. Truly, she felt as if she was about to burst with it all. 

*Kiss me, Secchan.* 

The command was heard and instantly obeyed, the kiss sweet, loving, 
wonderful and lingering, neither girl realizing that this was not 
something that was normal for their interactions before this moment. 

Neither of them could say how long their kiss lasted, but they were 
still blissfully engaged in it when a brief knock was heard and a 
certain redhead poked her head inside the door. &quot;Are you guys awake 
yet?&quot; Asuna called out in that hushed kind of voice that people have 
that don&#39;t really want to be heard, and then she walked in to check on 
them. 

&quot;OHMYGOSH! I&#39;M SORRY!&quot; Asuna spun around so fast in her attempt to leave 
that she instead spun a full circle and tripped on her own feet, falling 
face-first into the floor. 

Konoka&#39;s only reaction was to giggle while Setsuna shot out of bed to 
attend their injured friend. &quot;Careful, Asuna-san... it&#39;s alright, it&#39;s 
ok...&quot;  Aiding the fiercely blushing girl to her feet was a bit more 
difficult than it should have been, but eventually Setsuna managed, 
amidst many an embarrassed apology from Asuna and friendly dismissals 
from Setsuna and Konoka both. 

Eventually they all calmed down, and sitting by the table sharing some 
tea it almost felt like any normal day for them. Except Asuna noticed 
that every so often that one or the other of her two friends would 
appear to reply to something that had not been actually said out loud, 
and also upon occasion their eyes would meet and sort of glaze over, and 
Asuna just knew that if she didn&#39;t remind them that she was there right 
then she would be witness to another makeout session. Who would have 
thought? 

In one of her attempts to dodge possible exposure to things she really 
did not want to see regarding the girl that was almost a sister to her, 
Asuna brought up the subject of the new Pactio card. In the whirlwind of 
activity that followed it soon became apparent to the tall girl that the 
previous day&#39;s events had somehow slipped the minds of her two friends, 
probably because, in Asuna&#39;s opinion, they had been too occupied being 
utterly besotted by one another. After a fair dose of squealing and 
admiring the new Pactio card, Setsuna and Konoka made for Konoemon&#39;s 
office with Asuna in tow, obeying Eishun&#39;s note that they should come 
see him when they had woken up. 

Smiling to herself Asuna wondered if Setsuna and Konoka were even aware 
that they were holding hands the whole way to the principal&#39;s office. 

-------------------- 

Even though Konoka and Setsuna themselves had only walked in somewhere 
in the middle of the ongoing discussion regarding their Pactio and what 
really had happened during it, the part they were present for was quite 
lengthy and exhausting nonetheless. Add to that the general sense of 
confusion and overwhelming embarrassment and awkwardness, at least one 
Shinemeiryuu warrior felt quite frayed around the edges before the night 
was over. 

Konoka on the other hand never seemed to waver much, even when poked and 
prodded and asked to attempt small tasks to determine something or other 
about their newly formed bond, although Setsuna at least knew that all 
the overeager attention was annoying her ojousama as well. Mostly 
because Konoka seemed quite convinced that she and Setsuna should just 
be allowed to be alone together already. 

Setsuna&#39;s true torment began after Asuna happened to reveal a secret 
that Konoka and Setsuna themselves had not realized they were keeping, 
by telling the other magic-wielders present that she had noticed that 
they seemed to be answering things the other had not spoken out loud 
sometimes. A brief examination followed, after which everyone was 
convinced that Setsuna and Konoka had been gifted with a telepathic bond 
thanks to the Pactio - something which apparently could happen upon 
occasion if the mage was particularly strong or the two in the Pactio 
were especially close. 

At first Setsuna had wondered why Evangeline was grinning so 
mischievously at those news, but it did not take long before it was all 
too clear to her. Konoka was delighted with their new &#39;gift&#39; and started 
experimenting using it, occasionally making it somewhat hard for Setsuna 
to know whether something was spoken out loud or just in her mind.  

Then Konoka got a bit naughty, and shortly after that Setsuna discovered 
that not only words but images as well could be transmitted through 
their new link. She spent the rest of the evening blushing in a variety 
of shades, causing the other people in the room to eye the widely 
grinning - yet strangely innocent-looking - Konoka with suspicion. 

Konoka had, Setsuna decided, a surprisingly dirty mind when she wanted 
to, and a very wicked, active and above all graphic imagination. At one 
point Setsuna had been forced to excuse herself, run over to the first 
large source of water she could find, and dunk her head in it. She would 
later apologize profusely for ruining a magical artefact as well as for 
getting water on Konoemon&#39;s expensive rugs. 

Whether he was sensing the futility in keeping them longer or whether it 
was just sympathy for the tormented Setsuna, Konoemon decided to end the 
meeting not long after that point. Asuna and Negi of course left with 
them, and by the time they parted ways for the night Setsuna and Konoka 
were too tired to do anything other than head straight for bed. 

While the experience in her employer&#39;s office had Setsuna dreading the 
new turn of her Pactio with Konoka, she found an unexpected blessing in 
it that quickly lay most of her concerns at rest when Setsuna set to 
climb up to the small upper bunk she&#39;d decided were hers, leaving the 
wider bottom bunk for Konoka. 

Setsuna&#39;s beautiful princess had fiddled with the buttons on her green 
pyjamas while standing next to the bed, glancing up at Setsuna from 
underneath glossy brown bangs. &quot;A-are you going to sleep now, Secchan?&quot; 
The adorable girl had said, sounding surprisingly small and young, 
making Setsuna&#39;s heart constrict. 

Yes? No? Setsuna had experienced one of her familiar small bouts of 
panic then, the kind she got whenever something seemed to upset her 
ojousama and Setsuna couldn&#39;t figure out what she was supposed to do to 
make it better despite desperately wanting to. She ended up grunting in 
a way that could have meant anything. 

&quot;Oh.&quot; It was such a tiny, sad sound, made all the worse because Konoka 
did not say anything else, she merely crawled into her own bed. If not 
for their new ability Setsuna would&#39;ve had no idea what to do to make 
her precious ojousama happy again. 

It came to her in an image what Konoka had wanted, although the other 
girl had probably not intended it for Setsuna&#39;s perusal. The image had 
Setsuna and Konoka sleeping together, Konoka&#39;s head resting on Setsuna&#39;s 
shoulder and the girls comfortably holding one another, much like the 
position they had found themselves in upon waking. 

With a slight blush dusting her cheeks Setsuna acquiesced with the 
unspoken request, knowing she could not deny her ojousama anything, 
especially when the longing that accompanied the image had been a mirror 
of Setsuna&#39;s own. Although it was a little bit awkward at first for the 
young warrior to get into bed with the one she cherished above all else, 
Konoka&#39;s eagerness and wide smile soon made Setsuna feel more 
comfortable and sure of herself. Finally they were snuggled up together 
to satisfaction, and what a wonderful sensation that was. 

*Never let me go, Secchan. I want you to hold me always.* 

Burying her nose into sweet-smelling hair Setsuna&#39;s silent reply was as 
instant as it was felt by every fibre of her being. 

*I&#39;ll hold you forever if you&#39;ll let me. I love you, Konochan.* 

Konoka&#39;s hug was crushing but pleasantly so, and as she buried her face 
in Setsuna&#39;s neck Setsuna could feel the wetness of a few stray tears. 

*I love you too Secchan! I always have.* 

Although there were a few tears of joy between them, mostly the time 
before sleep found them there, cuddled together like they would be from 
now on, was spent on soft words of love and even softer kisses. On the 
bedside table the Pactio card stood once more, a gleaming symbol of ties 
that could not be broken, and the promise of the future. 

--------------------------  

Once the younger - or at least younger-appearing - people had cleared 
the room, Eishun turned towards his father-in-law with a slightly 
evaluating look. After a long moment of silent contemplation he finally 
spoke up. &quot;Well? What are your thoughts?&quot; 

The look that Konoemon threw his way was annoyed but also wryly amused. 
&quot;What do I think? I think I really stepped in it this time, that&#39;s what 
I think.&quot; He pulled a hand over his eyes and sighed. &quot;Evangeline seems 
to be of the opinion that their Pactio can&#39;t be broken.&quot; 

Eishun nodded, a corner of his mouth twitching with the beginnings of a 
smile. &quot;Yes, I heard.&quot; A breath. &quot;I don&#39;t know enough about it to 
speculate whether it could be broken or not, but... I think the real 
question is, should it be broken?&quot; 

&quot;You approve of this situation then?&quot; Konoemon knew his son-in-law well 
enough not to have to ask really, but felt the matter at hand needed 
Eishun to voice his opinion. &quot;I know you are very fond of Setsuna-kun.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed I am.&quot; The smile was a little bit more visible now. &quot;And as we 
discussed and agreed upon before, I could not wish for anyone better for 
Konoka. I stand by that statement.&quot; 

&quot;You do know that this is not an ordinary Pactio, not even an ordinary 
Permanent Pactio, don&#39;t you?&quot; Konoemon asked wryly. &quot;They are as good as 
married already, with this... even if we were to find some nice young 
man for Konoka it would end up in bloodshed, either theirs or his, no 
matter what we tried to do.&quot; 

&quot;As long as they are happy.&quot; Eishun did smile now, and he met Konoemon&#39;s 
eyes evenly. If Konoka&#39;s grandfather disapproved of the young couple 
their lives would be difficult, but Eishun would support them every step 
of the way. Fortunately Eishun knew that the old man, while tough to his 
enemies, was a soft touch at heart, especially when it came to his 
precious grandchild. &quot;And honestly, neither of them will be happy if 
they were separated, we&#39;ve already seen that haven&#39;t we?&quot; 

Konoemon snorted something about foolishness, children and romance, but 
threw up his hands in a gesture of defeat. &quot;Alright, alright. I do like 
and trust Setsuna-kun, and if she had been a male I would have been 
delighted to see Konoka paired up with her, in fact I would have 
arranged for them long ago.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll just have to leave them be and see how things turn out.&quot; Eishun 
suggested, moving over to pour them some tea. &quot;I still think this is how 
it is meant to be.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot; Konoemon agreed and accepted his cup. &quot;I won&#39;t attempt to 
interfere unless something disastrous happens.&quot; 

Eishun nodded silently and placed a few extra sweets from Konoemon&#39;s 
secret hiding place onto a plate for his father-in-law whose facial 
expression immediately brightened at the sight. 

Reaching for the plate Konoemon added &quot;...we could always have 
Setsuna-kun&#39;s gender changed with a spell or a potion...&quot; 

The plate of goodies was suddenly out of reach, causing the old man to 
pout and grumble. &quot;Alright already! No changing Setsuna-kun&#39;s gender...&quot; 
Muttering quietly to himself so that the thankless whelp holding his 
sweets hostage would not hear him he added &quot;Unless of course they get 
married and need a temporary change to give me great-grandchildren...&quot; 

Eishun, relinquishing the plate to the old man, pretended not to hear 
and placidly took a sip of his tea. </pre>
