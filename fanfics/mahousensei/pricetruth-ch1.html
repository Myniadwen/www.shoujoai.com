<h1>The Price of Truth (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/okashira.html">OkashiraShinomori</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Greetings, everyone! Yeah, I know, this isn&#39;t my usual pairing, but this 
ain&#39;t my usual fic either. This story was written as per the 
requirements for a fan fic challenge involving a quote from a different 
series. That quote isn&#39;t used in this chapter, but it will be in the 
next. Anyway, this is my first attempt with this pairing, and I hope you 
enjoy it.

And of course, my usual thank yous. First of all, to ChibiSecchan, 
obviously. One for making the challenge that brought forth this fic, and 
also for general inspiration and such. Next to my beta-readers for this 
one, Spiritmage, Shinmeiryuu, and SilverCat. My grammar appreciates you. 

----------

Kazumi stretched out on her bed, her hands behind her head, eyes trained 
on the ceiling. She heaved a long sigh into the silent dorm room, noting 
the echo unconsciously. &quot;Why does today have to seem so...so...slow?&quot;

The room was silent, for there was no-one else present, seemingly. After 
several seconds, the shadowy figure of a young girl slowly coalesced to 
the point of nearly being opaque at the end of Asakura Kazumi&#39;s bed. The 
incorporeal girl turned, forming the wisp of her lower body into two 
long legs and folded them beneath her, resting her hands on her thighs. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Asakura-san.&quot;

The self-proclaimed &quot;Mahora Paparazzi&quot; sighed again and rolled over onto 
her side, curling up in the process. &quot;It seems like nothing interesting 
happens anymore.&quot;

After a second of consideration, she laughed softly to herself. Nothing 
happening. Yeah, right. The biggest two stories of any journalist&#39;s 
career had been presented to her on a silver platter. But she either 
would not or could not take advantage of them. Her homeroom teacher, one 
Negi Springfield, had shown himself to be a mage before her on several 
occasions. Several of his students, her classmates, assisted him 
regularly in his endeavors to obtain a certain magical rank whose name 
she couldn&#39;t recall, despite her nearly photographic memory. Aside from 
being able to offer the world definitive proof that magic permeated 
nearly every facet of the world, one of the red-head&#39;s closes friends 
had been dead for sixty years. It had taken a while to get used to it, 
but Aisaka Sayo&#39;s habit of suddenly appearing behind her to ask an 
innocent question no longer caused Kazumi&#39;s hair to stand on end any 
more so than it regularly did.

Either of the stories would skyrocket the fifteen year-old to star 
status within an instant of being reported to the more public press. 
Despite her general lust for fame and fortune, she refused to make 
either her teacher or best friend into a proverbial zoo exhibit. Damn my 
morals. She made a face then chuckled to herself, drawing an interested 
look from the quiet girl by her feet.

Without a sound, Aisaka Sayo levitated a few inches above the covers, 
then floated out over the side of the bed to hover beside the red-headed 
girl at eye level. &quot;What was funny, Asakura-san?&quot;

Once again, Kazumi was struck by the innocence in the girl&#39;s voice. 
Since they were, essentially, the same age, Kazumi attributed the now 
rare quality to the time period that Sayo had grown up in. &quot;Nothin&#39;. 
Just thinkin&#39;.&quot;

She seemed to consider this, then nodded, a smile gracing her features. 
The silver-haired girl meandered over the open winder, her attention 
drawn by the chirping of a young bird.

Kazumi&#39;s eyes followed her absently, her thoughts wandering as much as 
her quiet companion&#39;s attention, searching for some topic to 
investigate, some theory to disprove. She had always been thus, 
extremely inquisitive, asking why and not being satisfied with adults&#39; 
vague answers even as a young child.

Sayo giggled and Kazumi focused reflexively on the girl. As usual, one 
mystery surfaced among her thoughts upon thinking of her. How did she 
die? She&#39;d researched it already more than most other topics, yet had 
found only a side-note mentioning her death and a tanka poem by her. 
She&#39;d been meaning to check a bit deeper, do some cross-analyzing, check 
police and hospital records and such, but hadn&#39;t had the time.

With a grunt, she sat up, her hands automatically setting her hair back 
into place. Despite outward appearances, it was actually quite a finite 
arrangement. When she had satisfied her moderate vanity, she pushed 
herself off the top bunk, landing lightly. &quot;Sayo-chan, wanna visit the 
library with me? I think I&#39;ve got time to do some more research on you. 
Maybe we&#39;ll get some results today.&quot; She winked at her. &quot;I feel lucky.&quot;

Sayo perked up immediately even though they&#39;d done the same many times 
previously with only disappointment. If there was one thing death had 
taught her though, it was that there were only so many things you could 
before getting bored. She&#39;s learned that if you&#39;re going to be bored, 
you might as well be doing something useful. &quot;Sure,&quot; she chirped, 
immediately crossing the room effortlessly.

Although not necessary in the least, Kazumi held the dorm&#39;s wooden door 
open for the specter, then stepped outside, closing and locking her room 
securely. She breathed deeply of the somewhat cooler air in the hallway 
and bounded after her free-floating friend. &quot;Hey, wait up, Sayo-chan!&quot; 
She passed a teacher who raised a hand to stop and admonish her for 
running in the hall, but fell silent as she spoke seemingly to no-one.

For reasons that were beyond either of their understandings, only a 
select few could see Sayo, and only Kazumi was able to do so at all 
times. The vast majority was unable to see her at all. Of the faculty, 
Kazumi only knew of Negi-sensei who knew of the girl so removed from 
time.

Sayo spun around in place with a grin, waiting for her friend to catch 
up. She floated out of the way as Kazumi caught up and took the stairs 
two at a time. With a wry grin, Sayo merely allowed gravity to take it&#39;s 
greatly reduced toll on her and she passed slowly through the floor down 
tot he first floor. Kazumi cast her a playful glare as she stepped off 
the last of the steps. &quot;That is so unfair, Sayo-chan.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; she answered simply, drifting towards the door leading to the 
campus grounds, waving for Kazumi to follow. &quot;C&#39;mon.&quot;

Sticking her tongue out at the silver-haired girl, prompting a giggle, 
she turned her camera on out of habit, checking it&#39;s battery and memory 
levels with a cursory glance. Though they rarely came out, she went 
ahead and snapped a picture of her spectral classmate, framed by a tree 
in the courtyard. The camera processed the image with a whir, then 
displayed it on the digital screen on the back. As she&#39;d expected, it 
showed only a tree and something of a blurry wisp before it. &quot;Oh well,&quot; 
she muttered, stepping out the door and into the sunlight as she powered 
down her camera and slipped it into the pocket of her uniform top.

Kazumi squinted around for Sayo. The girl had a tendency to become 
difficult to see in bright sunlight. She shrugged when she couldn&#39;t see 
the girl and trusted Sayo was either following her or already on her way 
to the library. With another sigh, she started on the long walk to the 
floating stronghold of knowledge.

Aisaka Sayo glided through a circular stained glass window, blinking the 
relatively dark interior of the European made building. In her sixty 
years since she had discovered she was no longer alive, she had 
thoroughly explored every square centimeter of the Mahora district. One 
of her favorite haunts, not that she did so, was the several main floors 
of Library Island.

She drifted contentedly down among the towering shelves, breathing 
deeply of the musty scent of books that had been old when she had been 
alive, ancient now. Not for the first time, she wished desperately that 
she could interact physically with the world. She had discovered 
thousands of books who&#39;s titles had drawn her interest, but she was ever 
unable to pull them from their shelves, blow the dust from their leather 
covers, and open them to their first yellowed page. She was used to it 
though, and there were much more important things she&#39;d wanted to 
interact with than books.

The worst part by far was watching her friends grieve over her, then 
slowly move on, eventually forgetting her entirely. Over her time 
incommunicado, she had found hundreds of people she would have loved to 
meet, talk with, and befriend, but each time she tried, ignorance was 
her only response.

Until this year, that is. With the introduction of Negi Springfield, her 
life, or after-life rather, had gotten considerably happier. The class 
he had taken over, middle school group A, had been hers when she still 
breathed out of necessity, and she had developed a tendency of staying 
around and observing that particular set of students. It had been an odd 
group to start with, but the appointment of a mage for a teacher seemed 
to have acted as a catalyst resulting in a select few learning of Aisaka 
Sayo&#39;s ghostly presence. Of all the 31 students, Asakura Kazumi had 
become particularly fond of her, and Sayo had obtained, for the first 
time in six decades, a friend.

The rest of those who could see her rarely interacted with her. Whether 
because they did not wish to have their sanity questioned publicly for 
&quot;talking to themselves,&quot; or because they simply didn&#39;t wish to, Sayo 
knew not. She didn&#39;t let it bother her though. Asakura Kazumi was 
friends enough for her. That she hadn&#39;t already exposed the apparition 
to the world was proof enough that she was true.

As was usual, the young ghost found her class&#39; Miyazaki Nodoka walking 
purposefully through the bookshelves, her arms full of books to be 
restacked. Again, Sayo wished she could help the young librarian, but 
such was, of course, not possible.

With a wistful sigh, she stuck her head through the wall to see where 
Kazumi was in relation to the building. With so many students milling 
around on the bridge connecting the one-building island and the mainland 
below, Sayo couldn&#39;t make out who was who, despite the unique 
configuration of her friend&#39;s hair. She floated back until she was 
completely in the interior once more, slowly drifting down to ground 
level, somewhere in the first-floor fiction section, comprising a 
quarter of the titles who&#39;s author&#39;s names started with &quot;Ka.&quot;

For the next several moments, Sayo floated from one end of the massive 
bookshelves to the other, committing the titles to memory as she had for 
every section before that. By doomsday, she planned most cheerfully on 
having every book&#39;s title memorized.

&quot;There you are!&quot; Sayo looked up to find Kazumi at the end of the row, 
her breathing slightly labored. &quot;I need to get a bike...&quot; she muttered as 
she walked slowly up to the girl, casting a roving eye over the books. 
She stepped politely around Sayo, rather than through her, certain the 
quiet girl was close behind her.

With practiced ease, she slid the hard chair that sat at the computer 
desk out and plopped down into it, her hand brushing the mouse. The fan 
in the CPU whirred anew and the screen flickered to life, casting an odd 
blue glow across both living and un-living faces.

Computers, Sayo found, where absolutely fascinating. She&#39;d marveled over 
calculators and other electronics as they evolved, however she was 
unable to learn how to use them as she could not touch them, thus the 
privilege of seeing them improve over decades was lost upon her. She 
believed strongly that she would enjoy using a computer though. To be 
able to look up anything across the planet from your own computer... she 
sighed wistfully and drifted closer to her friend, peering interestedly 
at the screen.

Several mouse clicks and a few seconds of typing later, the Mahora 
Paparazzi had the campus archives online.

She rapidly typed in Sayo&#39;s name, the correct kanji instantly leaping 
into place due to the number of times the search had been run. Every 
link on the Bagle search engine was displayed in an odd shade of purple 
that indicated that they&#39;d been previously clicked. Both knew from 
experience that the three pages of results were the same way, half of 
which were totally unrelated to the young girl floating behind her 
friend.

With a resigned sigh, Kazumi pulled a small pad of paper and pen from 
the same pocket she&#39;d deposited her camera in. She flipped it open to a 
blank page, sat it by the mouse, and clicked the first link in the list.

With the speed of one used to dissecting a document for only the 
pertinent information, Kazumi scoured the web page, a scan of a school 
newspaper at the time, jotting down phrases and names on the pad. The 
process continued in silence for a long while and Sayo drifted over to 
Kazumi&#39;s side, peering at the pad on which her friend was writing. She 
squinted in an unintentionally comedic manner and cocked her head, 
trying to decipher the journalist&#39;s hurried notes. Numbers she could 
make out, as well as a few location names, but other than that it was 
Greek to the incorporeal girl; a language Mahora hadn&#39;t offered when she 
still took classes.

Kazumi sat back heavily, her chair scraping harshly over the floor. Her 
pen clattered to the desktop and she craned her neck back to look at 
Sayo. &quot;Any of these things look familiar?&quot; She held the pad out to her 
companion who, from her vantage point, floated upside down.

Sayo laughed nervously and shook her head. &quot;It doesn&#39;t even look much 
like Japanese, Asakura-san.&quot;

Kazumi rolled her eyes and sat back up. &quot;Yeah, yeah, everyone&#39;s a 
critic...&quot; Her tone softened the blow of her words, and Sayo laughed 
again, floating behind her once more to watch from over her shoulder, 
sensing Kazumi was ready to do something they&#39;d not done before.

&quot;Moriyama Ichirou was mentioned four times...&quot; the red-head muttered, 
tapping at the keyboard then looking at her notes to confirm the kanji 
for the fellow&#39;s name. 3A&#39;s ghost blinked, recognizing the name but not 
associating it with anything.

As Kazumi hit the &quot;Enter&quot; key, Sayo focused her complete attention on 
the miraculous little screen. From the Mahora archives, ten pages of 
results registered initially. Both girls let out a soft breath of 
surprise, and Kazumi clicked the first link.

A sports report from August of 1939 appeared, a black and white picture 
of a handsome young man in the simply styled soccer uniforms of the day, 
a ball from his choice sport tucked under one arm. His face nagged at 
Sayo&#39;s memory, and she put a hand to her chin, concentrating with all 
her might. It had been years, decades, since anything had sparked a 
memory in her. Ichirou-kun?

&quot;Hmmm...interesting guy...star soccer player during his time at Mahora. 
Won 5 games nearly single-handedly.&quot; She whistled, an odd sound in the 
otherwise silent atmosphere. Kazumi turned back to Sayo and opened her 
mouth, but closed it when she saw Sayo&#39;s face. &quot;You remember him or 
something, Sayo-chan?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; It clearly bothered her that her memory was so 
fallible. That he was enough to make her try to remember something 
indicated he was probably of some importance to her.

Asakura grinned and threw an arm over the chair comfortably. &quot;Was he 
&#145;special&#39; to you, maybe?&quot;

She had meant it as something of a joke, to lighten the mood; solemnity 
didn&#39;t sit very well with the energetic girl. Sayo blushed darkly and 
clasped her hands behind her back, not meeting Kazumi&#39;s gaze. 
&quot;I...um...he might have been...I can&#39;t really remember.&quot;

The living girl raised an eyebrow, her own good mood seeming to 
evaporate without cause. With a shrug, she turned back to the computer, 
jotting down a few notes about Moriyama Ichirou on a clean page of her 
notepad. As Sayo directed half of her attention on the computer and half 
on her own memories, Kazumi was busy reading between the lines. Good 
looking and a valued jock might make him slightly conceited. Winning 
those games no doubt inflated his head at the time. She wrote her 
guesses of his personality on a separate sheet, her face screwed up in 
concentration.

The next several web pages were more of the same, although Kazumi noted 
another connection among her data. The sports editorials had been 
written by Aoki Kana, a girl whose name was listed in Kazumi&#39;s notes to 
have been mentioned three times in relation to Aisaka Sayo. She circled 
her name and continued onto the next link, a newspaper scan of a 
different sort.

After a healthy amount of reading, Kazumi came upon the soccer player, 
now third in a list within an article entitled &quot;Mahora Academy&#39;s 
Students Rated Highest in Prefecture.&quot; Again, Kazumi allowed a low 
whistle to escaper her lips. &quot;Good student as well...&quot;

Once more, she turned back to the ghost, snapping her fingers to draw 
her attention. &quot;Sayo-chan, if you were friends with this guy, you 
must&#39;ve been a pretty good student as well.&quot; At least, that was her 
guess. His high rating in the school only compounded her generalization 
that he was likely egotistical, possible even arrogant. She realized it 
wasn&#39;t fair to categorize him as such based on averages, but part of the 
job of initial investigation was to generalize in order to develop a 
good picture of the possible happenings of a situation.

Sayo sighed heavily and shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t remember, Asakura-san I 
just don&#39;t.&quot; Her eyes held a pleading look. &quot;And I don&#39;t know why I 
don&#39;t remember.&quot; She drifted away a little bit as she spoke, seeming to 
be trying to talk herself through it logically. &quot;I remember 
Ichirou-kun,&quot; Kazumi instantly took note of Sayo&#39;s familiarity with the 
boy, &quot;and I suppose we were friends, but I can&#39;t think of anything we 
did, or any conversation, or even what he sounds like. I just 
remember...I&#39;m missing something.&quot;

Kazumi sighed in response to the girl&#39;s rambling explanation. From most, 
such would have sounded melodramatic, but from Aisaka Sayo, the words 
were pure and genuine. &quot;He does sound important to you...&quot;

The ghost didn&#39;t respond her observation, so Kazumi turned her attention 
back to the computer, a sudden small feeling of despondence making its 
presence felt. I wonder what it&#39;s like to be missing an entire portion 
of your life... it suddenly occurred to the journalist that such a 
condition was not unheard of. Amnesia was a human malady and she had 
always recognized Sayo as having it. However the ramifications of that 
hadn&#39;t occurred her. If a ghost can get amnesia, what else can they get? 
Are they only affected by mental conditions?

As she usually did when she was struck by something particularly 
interesting, Kazumi absently chewed on the back end of her pen. This 
opens an entire new branch of medical study. A long sigh escaped her 
once more. And I can&#39;t do anything with the information. I can&#39;t decide 
if I&#39;m blessed or cursed... Deciding to think more on it later, she made 
a note of it a few pages further in her pad, then flipped to where she 
had been.

The remainder of the links were either unrelated or more articles about 
his exploits in soccer or academic accomplishments. &quot;Why isn&#39;t there 
anything current?&quot; she muttered rhetorically as she browsed another 
article by Aoki Kana, this one rather scathing, about a soccer game he&#39;d 
participated in, winning the game for the team in the latter half.

She bit down hard on the end of her pen, looking determinedly at the 
reporter girl&#39;s name. I wonder why she&#39;s so much harsher now. Kazumi 
chuckled. Maybe they&#39;d been going out, then broke up. It seemed like the 
kind of petty thing most people would do.

Kazumi&#39;s constantly wandering mind was sparked off by the possibility, 
starting down another path. Perhaps they were going out, and Sayo-chan 
was jealous of Aoki...No! He might have broken up with Sayo-chan to be 
with her, and Sayo-chan committed suicide as a result of extreme 
depression! Although the timid spectral girl certainly didn&#39;t seem the 
suicidal sort, she was much too gentle and caring, it was a possibility 
that couldn&#39;t be dismissed.

&quot;Hey Sayo-chan, do you know an Aoki Kana?&quot; The kanji for the name 
replaced the hiragana in the Bagle text box as she said the name.

Sayo turned back around to face Kazumi and nodded ferverently. I do 
remember her!&quot; Her innocent face broke into a broad smile. &quot;She was...in 
the same homeroom as me.&quot; She grinned at Kazumi, her voice rising in the 
excitement of memory. &quot;She worked on the paper, just like you!&quot;

The smile was infectious, and the journalist nodded. &quot;She was indeed. 
Pretty high on the ladder too, by the looks of it.&quot; The number of 
returns for the reporter girl were twice as numerous as Moriyama 
Ichirou&#39;s had been. Kazumi perused the brief description of the web 
sites on the links, comparing dates, and found that Aoki Kana had gone 
on into professional journalism, finally ending up in Kyoto as one of 
their larger newspaper&#39;s highest level reporters.

Kazumi grinned, sharing in the girl&#39;s success. Their ambitions seemed 
much alike. She began methodically clicking the blue highlighted text 
and threw a question over her shoulder to Sayo. &quot;What else do you 
remember about her?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; her voice trailed off in thought, then the ghost of a blush 
swept over her cheeks. &quot;She was very pretty. Everyone was so jealous of 
her.&quot; She giggled at some memory or another, not sharing it aloud, but 
taking pleasure in it nonetheless. &quot;Her dad worked in the military as a 
radio operator, I think.&quot; She went silent, thinking for a bit. &quot;She was 
always really energetic, ready to do just about anything, and always 
tryin&#39; to get me to do stuff.&quot;

She made a face jokingly. &quot;We were roommates and she&#39;d always drag me 
along with her when she went places. &#145;You have to be more social, 
Sayo-chan!&#39; she&#39;d say.&quot; The ghost paused again and smiled contentedly. 
&quot;She was my best friend.&quot;

Mahora&#39;s resident paparazzi nodded, hearing the smile in her voice and 
allowing one to cross her own lips. She opened her mouth to say 
something as she made a note of Aoki&#39;s increasing dislike of Moriyama as 
time seemed to progress, but was stopped short.

&quot;Thank you so much, Asakura-san!&quot; Nearly scaring the living girl off her 
chair, Sayo&#39;s ghostly arms surrounded her in the closest thing to a hug 
manageable, bits of her uniform sleeves disappearing into Kazumi&#39;s arms 
and shoulders as the specter floated to and fro slightly. &quot;Thank you 
thank you thank you!&quot;

Kazumi spun around, a slightly confused grin focused on Sayo. &quot;Uh...what 
for, Sayo-chan?&quot;

The long-deceased girl smiled widely, a tear coalescing in her right 
eye. &quot;For?Aoki. Because of you, I remember my best friend. I remember.&quot; 
She stressed the word happily and the tear rolled down her cheek, then 
fell into the air, seeming to dissolve.

Understanding dawned on the red-head and she grinned cockily at her 
friend. &quot;You ain&#39;t seen nothin&#39; yet.&quot; Cracking her knuckles 
theatrically, she returned to the keyboard with renewed fervor. Sayo 
settled down into the air behind her, already quite satisfied with the 
day.

&quot;What is this...&quot; With a puzzled expression, she opened a link different 
from all the others. Most had been archived scans of the girl&#39;s 
articles, but this one was from a personal web page, not school or 
public records. An image and several following paragraphs of text 
appeared onscreen, and Kazumi immediately enlarged the poor quality 
picture. Like others, it was a newspaper scan, but one that Kazumi had 
seen in no official records anywhere.

It displayed the now familiar visage of Moriyama Ichirou and in bold 
letters &quot;Academy Star Murders Fellow Student!&quot; Directly below the 
headline was &quot;By Aoki Kana.&quot; Kazumi&#39;s eyebrows both shot up in surprise 
and she folded her hands thoughtfully before her. In what was a clearly 
emotional editorial, Aoki Kana made claim that the soccer champ had 
cruelly murdered a mutual friend, although she seemed too caught up in 
her anger and sadness to explain the motive of the alleged killer.

Luckily, she had kept her wits about her enough to explain that the girl 
had been strangled brutally, leaving ugly bruises along her throat, and 
shoved into an empty classroom carelessly. The time of death had been 
proclaimed as eleven thirty five that morning, and Aoki stated that she 
had met with the murdered girl not ten minutes before that.

A gasp drew the attention of the nearby ghost as Kazumi finally found 
mention of the murdered girl&#39;s name. &quot;I thought so!&quot; Kazumi hunched over 
slightly in her seat, browsing the newer text below the scan of the 
paper. The floating girl near her looked excitedly over her shoulder, 
waiting patiently for the reporter girl to fill her in on her findings.

Kazumi was silent as she read, though her heart began to beat with 
progressive speed. When she had finished, she sat back, grinning 
triumphantly despite the nature of what she had discovered.

&quot;What&#39;d you find out, Asakura-san?&quot; Sayo peered closely at the screen in 
a vain attempt to uncover what her friend had.

&quot;Well, in short,&quot; she paused for effect, a bad habit of hers, &quot;I think 
you were murdered by the soccer champ.&quot;

Sayo flicked her gaze from Kazumi to the screen, then back again. 
&quot;Ichirou-kun murdered me?&quot;

The Paparazzi nodded. &quot;Not only did he murder you, but when your friend 
tried to expose it, the school and government covered it up. That&#39;s why 
there are so few references to you online. Most of the stuff must&#39;ve 
alluded to Aoki-san&#39;s incriminating little article here.&quot;

She again raised her pen to lips thoughtfully as Sayo processed the 
girl&#39;s spoken train of thought. &quot;His parents, according to what I found, 
where in the government, but it&#39;s ridiculous to think they&#39;d be able to 
cover up a murder.&quot; She bit down on the pen and focused her sharp eyes 
on Sayo. &quot;Dis bringin&#39; back&#39;ny mem&#39;ries?&quot;

The girl&#39;s mind was working at a furious pace as it was assimilating 
what Kazumi was telling her with her of own fractured memories.

Perhaps she was simply overwhelmed by the already powerful influx of 
memories. Since Kazumi had broken the dam, in the few minutes in which 
she had been reading, Sayo had been slowly piecing things together in 
her mind to form coherent memories. There wasn&#39;t much, but she&#39;d only 
just begun to sort through the flood.

After a little consideration, she hesitantly shook her head, casting an 
apologetic glance at Kazumi. &quot;Some memories, yeah, but nothing bad like 
that.&quot; She raised her hands in a gesture of futility and shrugged.

Kazumi sighed and bit down hard on the pen, turning back to the 
computer. &quot;I&#39;d be&#39; no f&#39;rmal in&#39;estigation was e&#39;er made if dis was 
such&#39;n immediate co&#39;er up.&quot; The observation hung undisputed in the air 
while she typed at the keyboard once again. Before Sayo had a chance to 
look at what she was researching, Kazumi hummed a triumphant noise and 
scribbled a bit more in her pad. &quot;I think,&quot; she began closing her 
various internet windows, &quot;I&#39;d like to meet this Moriyama Ichirou.&quot;

Sayo frowned a little bit, concerned if Kazumi&#39;s evaluation of her once 
friend were correct. &quot;Does he still live nearby?&quot;

&quot;Well, not really close, but not too far by train.&quot;

The ghost chewed her lower lip nervously. &quot;But you said Ichirou-kun was 
dangerous...&quot;

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry &#145;bout me, Sayo-chan.&quot; Kazumi flashed the girl a toothy 
grin as she stood and slid her chair back under the computer desk. She 
ripped the page with what Sayo assumed was the man&#39;s address from her 
notebook, then slipped the pad into her pocket.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go back to the room or somewhere nice and see if you can 
remember anything? You&#39;ve got quite a bit of catching up to do, after 
all.&quot; The red-head nodded knowledgably, although she didn&#39;t&#39; know the 
depth to which she was correct.

Sayo was still hesitant, and her voice reflected that. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re 
sure...&quot;

Mahora&#39;s Paparazzi split her index and middle fingers in a &quot;v&quot; symbol. 
&quot;I&#39;m sure. Besides, if you remember it all without me, I won&#39;t have to 
bother with Moriyama.&quot;

The wispy girl seemed to consider this, then nodded energetically. &quot;I&#39;ll 
try my best then, Asakura-san!&quot;

Kazumi glanced at her watch. &quot;Meet back at the dorm at...5?&quot; Sayo nodded 
in confirmation. &quot;See you in a few hours, Sayo-chan!&quot; Breaking rules 
both with her voice level and the excessive speed with which she moved, 
Kazumi dashed down the rows of books and out the vaulted doorway of the 
library.

Despite all her reassurances, Sayo had an unfounded nagging feeling that 
meeting the man she&#39;d known during her life would ultimately end badly.
Kazumi sighed and grabbed hold of one of the white rings suspended from 
the luggage rack. She&#39;d really hoped for a seat, seeing as how the ride 
would last a little longer than thirty minutes. Out of the corner of her 
eye, she noticed an extremely short man of about fifty, his eyes resting 
intently on her. With a grimace, she tugged the plaid uniform skirt 
required of all Mahora&#39;s female students down a little further, guessing 
that the man had probably seen more than an eyeful from his point of 
view. Damn perverted old man...

The train lurched to motion, causing the reporter to sway abruptly as a 
voice over the inter-train communication system stated what anyone would 
notice: they had departed Mahora Station. She quickly attuned herself to 
the movements of the train and tried to ignore the old man whose 
attempts to veil his efforts to peek beneath her skirt as being mere 
jostling of the train were easily seen through.

I wonder why a guy so prominent in high school would virtually drop out 
of the spotlight after graduation. Most try to at least maintain the 
level of public exposure they had during the school year, but most try 
to get more. It really seemed rather illogical, unless she had evaluated 
his personality wrong. I suppose he could be just the type to shine 
naturally in academics, but whatever he did afterward didn&#39;t go so well.

She sighed. That didn&#39;t seem to fit either. Obviously he knew both her 
classmate, Aisaka Sayo, and the original Mahora Paparazzi, Aoki Kana. 
The connection was undeniable, and likely integral to Sayo&#39;s death, but 
Kazumi was unsure as to how. Aoki definitely believed him to be the 
killer, but had provided no proof and had been easily silenced. If it 
had been provable in the least, the case would&#39;ve been picked up again 
by now. That it hasn&#39;t might mean there&#39;s no support to her accusation.

She was sure such a thing happened normally among detectives and others 
involved in law enforcement, but it seemed rather staggering to one 
about to enter high school. She shook her head in an attempt to clear 
her thoughts. Things shouldn&#39;t be as muddled after I talk to the guy.

Her thoughts occupied her active mind for the entire trip, only becoming 
distracted long enough for her to grab a seat when the perverted old man 
thank god, got off the train. She settled deep into the seat, her blank 
gaze trained out the window.

When the conductor announced her stop, she was immediately on her feet 
and pushing insistently through the rather tight crowd toward the doors, 
slightly surprised at her own deep interest in case she had decided to 
investigate freelance. She stepped off the marginally higher floor of 
the train onto the concrete surface of the station, bringing one hand up 
to her eyes to shade them from the sun that had decided to make its way 
to that height in the sky that was only bothersome to drivers and 
pedestrians alike.

Despite the relative size of the city, the station was small, almost 
quaint with its old wooden benches in the middle. A fair number of 
people milled about, but not nearly what Kazumi had expected. Shrugging 
the inconsistency away, she made her way to the ticket-taking machine, 
then outside onto the more modern looking street.

She pulled the slip of paper bearing Moriyama&#39;s address from her pocket 
and compared it to a map that had been folded up in a compartmentalized 
box at the station&#39;s entrance. &quot;Ooh, great. It&#39;s within walking 
distance.&quot; She breathed a sigh of relief, happy to not have to lighten 
her wallet more than for the train ticket.

Slipping the paper back into her pocket, she set off at a jaunty pace. 
As was normal when she was nearing what she expected to be some crucial 
part of a news story, her heart began to beat slightly faster. The fact 
that the man she was to meet was a potential murdered didn&#39;t seem to 
bother the red-head as much as it would most people.

After the events revolving around Negi-sensei, she felt empowered, 
regardless of the fact that she was not in any way at all. Besides, she 
grinned, he&#39;s old now. If he tried anything, it&#39;d likely be 
strangulation again, and at his age... She managed to mostly contain a 
small chuckle at the prospect.

As Kazumi tapped at her foot at a traffic light, it occurred to her that 
even if she couldn&#39;t expose Sayo-chan to the press, apprehending the 
murderer from a sixty year-old case would certainly earn her some 
prestige, even among the professionals. Thoughts of spots on talk shows, 
interviews with local news channels, and a report about her rather than 
by her in the paper brought a painfully wide grin to her face. As she 
strode down the street, the crowd gave her a wide berth.

Her eyes scanned the buildings, and when they fell upon the apartment 
registered to Moriyama Ichirou, her grin dropped and her demeanor became 
serious once more. She fingered the camera in her pocket unconsciously, 
powering it up for use if necessary.

Kazumi pulled open the thick glass door with a grunt, finding that once 
it began to swing, it was quite easily moved. She stepped inside and 
looked around curiously. The plush carpet seemed relatively new, and the 
smell of fresh paint was evident, although barely, in the air. Replicas 
of famous pieces of artwork tastefully decorated the lobby area&#39;s 
pristine white walls. A single gold chandelier cast a soft light 
throughout the room even during the day. Behind the oak reception desk, 
a middle-aged woman cast her a gaze somewhere between bored and annoyed. 
I don&#39;t imagine it&#39;s very exciting working here...

Mahora&#39;s Paparazzi stepped up to the counter with a cheerful smile, 
resting her hands on the glossy top. &quot;Afternoon, ma&#39;am.&quot;

The woman nodded but refrained from replying.

&quot;I&#39;m here to see Moriyama Ichirou-san, if he&#39;s in.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; The clerk tapped at her computer for a second, then turned 
back. &quot;Moriyama-san is currently in, but I&#39;m afraid he doesn&#39;t have much 
to do with guests.&quot;

This is more like a hotel than any apartment... Kazumi shook her head. 
The rich are so odd. &quot;I&#39;m Mahora Academy Girls&#39; Middle School&#39;s lead 
reporter, and I&#39;m here to do an article on him for a special edition of 
the paper focusing on influential students from Mahora&#39;s past.&quot; The lie 
came easily to the born embellisher, so much so that she hardly had to 
think about it, knowing she wouldn&#39;t slip up on it later.

&quot;In that case...Moriyama-san may see you, miss.&quot;

Kazumi grunted quietly in affirmation. I figured he was the type to like 
media coverage. She waited with feigned patience for the clerk to dial 
Moriyama&#39;s room. The older woman spoke in hushed tones with one Kazumi 
could only assume to be her target, then nodded and hung the phone up 
with a click.

&quot;Moriyama-san says he will see you.&quot; She pointed at the elevator. &quot;His 
room is on the third floor, number 3-2.&quot;

The red-head nodded and grinned appreciatively. &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am.&quot; With 
an excited bounce in her step, Kazumi tapped the &quot;Up&quot; button on the 
wall, and a short moment later, the wood paneled doors before her slid 
open with a quiet &quot;ding.&quot; She walked in and spun on her heel, finding 
and hitting the button for the third floor quickly.

Being in a higher class apartment area, the elevator was slow, as was 
the music gently flowing from its hidden speakers. As soon as it came to 
a rest and it&#39;s doors slid open once more, Kazumi exited into a hallway 
much like the lobby, although it lacked the faux artwork. The door 
directly before her bore a gold plate marking at as 3-5, and a quick 
scan of the hallway pointed her to the wall the elevator was on and to 
her right.

One hand on her camera, she knocked lightly on the door several yards 
down the hall labeled 3-2. The lock clicked after several moments of 
silence, and Kazumi sensed it was up to her to open the door.

She pushed it open and stuck her head in curiously, her gaze swinging 
around the room until it came to rest on the tall figure of Moriyama 
Ichirou. She blinked in some surprise at his appearance. The years had 
been quite good to one of Mahora&#39;s original soccer stars. She knew him 
to be in his mid seventies, but he looked like a man just entering his 
fifties, if even that. His hair was snow white and cropped relatively 
short in the contemporary fashion. He wore a pair of khaki shorts and a 
plain white polo shirt, both of which made it quite clear that he hadn&#39;t 
let his physique slip in old age as so many did.

&quot;Moriyama Ichirou-san?&quot;

He nodded. &quot;Yes indeed. May I ask who you are?&quot; His voice was something 
of a baritone, but not quite, perhaps a decibel or two higher.

Kazumi blinked at the vigor in his voice, then bowed as was customary. 
&quot;My name is Asakura Kazumi. I&#39;m a graduating third year middle schooler 
from Mahora Academy, and the lead journalist for the school paper.&quot; She 
straightened and looked at him, waiting for a comment.

Moriyama smiled cordially at her. &quot;I once knew a person much like 
yourself, Asakura-san. You remind me a lot about her.&quot;

Kazumi returned the smile with practiced ease, slipping seamlessly into 
reporter mode. &quot;Then it should make my interview go all the smoother, 
yes?&quot;

He nodded and motioned at a set of chairs near the picture window on the 
other side of the room. &quot;Indeed. Have a seat, Asakura-san. Would you 
like anything to drink?&quot;

&quot;No thank you,&quot; she declined as she settled into the seat, although she 
didn&#39;t allow herself to relax to the extent that was probably expected. 
After all, he was still a suspected murderer in her eyes.

He looked up from the drink he was mixing. &quot;What, precisely, am I being 
interviewed about, Asakura-san?&quot;

She shrugged and looked out the window. &quot;General things, really. Some of 
it&#39;s indiscriminate, some pertaining particularly to you.&quot;

Kazumi returned her gaze to Moriyama as he sat across from her, his 
knees popping protest as much as the springs squeaked for the same 
reason. He chuckled and sipped at his drink. &quot;Never direct, you 
reporters, eh?&quot;

She grinned and shook her head, drawing her pen and pad from her pocket. 
Time to get the basic happy-crappy out of the way... Kazumi launched 
herself into a host of questions all journalists had as default, simple, 
very general questions over broad topics. They were usually used to help 
the subject relax until they got to the difficult questions, but Kazumi 
was using it merely as a pretense.

A tribute to his age, Moriyama answered with the slow steadiness of one 
choosing words and experiences from a vast store. He was easy enough to 
talk to, and Kazumi surmised that his current charisma was still more 
than that of many, and that in his youth he must have been popular as 
much for his personality as for his academic and physical 
accomplishments.

A small surge of excitement gripped her as she began to tighten the rope 
of questions. &quot;Considering your accomplishments, would it be safe to 
assume you also had an active social life?&quot;

Moriyama seemed to consider the question, falling silent and swirling 
the ice within his glass around. &quot;I...yes, I think you can say that.&quot;

She grinned at him with a faux coy note in her voice, &quot;Popular with the 
ladies, sir?&quot;

He laughed again and a very faint blush colored his cheeks, &quot;That may be 
something of an overstatement, but I had a few girlfriends, yes.&quot; He 
became marginally more serious. &quot;As you can see, I never married 
though.&quot;

Kazumi nodded. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, who were your girlfriends? I may have 
already interviewed one or two of them.&quot;

He smiled and began rattling off a list of names. He stopped, and Kazumi 
thought, rather disappointedly, that he was done, but he continued in a 
somewhat sad voice, &quot;and Aoki Kana.&quot;

Mahora&#39;s Paparazzi underlined the name with a smug grin. Got&#39;cha. She 
looked up at him with a puzzled expression. &quot;Not Aisaka Sayo? Her name 
was mentioned several times in school records near yours. I thought 
maybe...&quot;

Moriyama Ichirou grimaced and tightened his grip on the glass. &quot;Her? 
Gods no, never that...never her.&quot; His eyes were as icy as the cubes in the 
glass he held.

Kazumi blinked in surprise at the energy behind his apparent hatred. She 
hadn&#39;t expected him to be so strongly against her after this many years. 
&quot;Er...why not sir? You seem to have something against her...&quot;

He cast what he hoped was a kind smile at her. &quot;I suppose I do have 
something of a grudge against the girl. You see, she...&quot; he looked about 
the room conspiratorially, &quot;is the one who took Aoki Kana from me.&quot;

Again, the red-head blinked in genuine surprise. &quot;She and Aisaka-san 
were a couple?&quot;

The man seemed to flinch at that. &quot;They were not, but the girl seduced 
Kana-chan away from me. I had asked her to park with me the day before. 
I had a picnic planned for the two of us. I had come to the library to 
pick her up as we were going to take a carriage to the park, and I saw 
her and Aisaka...&quot;

Asakura looked up from the notes she was jotting furiously. &quot;What were 
they doing, sir?&quot;

He remained silent, then smiled at her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I seem to be 
rambling. And it&#39;s most disrespectful for Aisaka-san as well.&quot;

Damn, he&#39;s avoiding it. Kazumi narrowed her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sure she wouldn&#39;t 
mind, nor would Aoki-san for that matter. This is, after all, in the 
pursuit of a good story.&quot;

Moriyama shook his head, his face darkening. &quot;No, I&#39;d rather not. Such 
things are better left forgotten.&quot; He fell silent as Kazumi searched 
around for another question, one that wouldn&#39;t arouse suspicion.

Well, it&#39;s better than nothing, she decided. &quot;What did you mean when you 
said that Aisaka-san seduced Kana-san from you, sir?&quot; Her expression was 
innocent.

He grunted and was silent for a moment longer. &quot;It&#39;s unkind to speak ill 
of the dead.&quot; Kazumi raised a curious eyebrow, obviously wanting him to 
continue. His eyes darted around the room, making sure it was secure as 
if he were about to digress a government secret.

&quot;Aisaka Sayo claimed to be in love with Kana-chan.&quot; His voice retained 
its kind lilt, but it was noticeably harder, and Kazumi saw his hand 
clench around his glass. His gaze flicked up to her and his tone changed 
slightly. &quot;In this day and age, such a thing isn&#39;t exactly unheard of, 
but at the time, Aisaka-san was considered an,&quot; he fell silent, his 
upbringing trying its hardest to make him choose his words with grace, 
&quot;atrocity.&quot;

She...she was in love with Aoki Kana? That would explain why she seemed 
so important to Sayo-chan... Kazumi tried to ignore the slightly 
increased pounding in her chest, and wiped her now slightly sweaty palm 
against her skirt. If both of them were in love with Aoki Kana, her 
heart quickened in agitation at the thought, although she was unsure 
why, then Sayo-chan taking her away would give Moriyama motive to kill 
her... She made a slightly unsteady note to that effect, circling it 
with her pen.

&quot;I...I see, sir.&quot; He seemed to appreciate the unease with which she 
responded, though his reasoning behind it was misinterpreted.

After a steadying breath, Kazumi clicked her pen closed and looked up at 
the clock. With a mock surprised gasp, she smiled her journalist&#39;s smile 
at the man. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Moriyama-san. I&#39;ve taken a lot of your time, and 
uninvited at that.&quot;

She stood and slipped her pan and pen into her pocket. The ex-soccer 
star rose as well, setting his glass on the arm of his chair. &quot;Not at 
all, Asakura-san.&quot; He bowed to her as she did him, then continued when 
he had straightened. &quot;It was a pleasure. It&#39;s not often I get 
interviewed anymore, and by my old school no less.&quot;

Kazumi grinned at him. &quot;I may need to come back if they want a follow up 
article.&quot; She tapped her pocket with the pad. &quot;Would that be okay, sir?&quot;

He nodded in a grandfatherly fashion. &quot;It would be my pleasure.&quot; The 
older man smiled congenially, &quot;but please try to make an appointment 
next time. It was rare that you caught me while I was here.&quot;

The reporter nodded vigorously and scratched the back of her neck in an 
apologetic manner. &quot;Yeah, sorry about that. I kinda missed your name on 
my list this morning when I was making those calls.&quot;

Moriyama waved it off easily. &quot;Have a nice day, Kazumi-san.&quot;

Yup, the interview&#39;s over. &quot;You too, Moriyama-san.&quot; With a final bow, 
she stepped out of the room, closing the door firmly behind her, hearing 
the lock click shortly afterwards.

As she proceeded down the hallway, she chewed thoughtfully on the tip of 
her pen, creating yet more small dents in it. &quot;So far, he&#39;s the only 
suspect, and now he has a motive...But my observations about his 
personality seem off. He didn&#39;t seem egotistical or anything at all...&quot; 
She shook her head. &quot;Damn. It&#39;s gonna be hard to tell Sayo-chan...&quot;</pre>
