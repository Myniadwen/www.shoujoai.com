<h1>The Adventures of Eva and Chachamaru (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a>

<pre>&quot;Goddamnit!&quot;

The front door to the tiny off-campus log cabin slammed back on its 
hinges as the tiny vampiroid shape of Evangeline stormed in through it, 
closely followed by the taller silent form of Chachamaru, seemingly 
oblivious to her mistress&#39; anger.

&quot;Goddamnit!&quot;

Throwing herself down onto her three seater sofa, the hundred plus year 
old vampire sulked like a petulant five year old. Chachamaru disappeared 
into the kitchen and reappeared an impossibly short instant later, 
carrying a tray bearing a steaming teapot and Evangeline&#39;s favourite 
teacup; the one with the humerous phrase about British people on it.

Evangeline continued fuming, arms crossed and eyes shooting lightning 
bolts at Chachamaru as she served the tea without so much as an upward 
glance. She scowled, and went back to watching the steam spiralling up 
from her tea. Actual emotions were lost on clockwork and magically 
powered puppets like Chachamaru.

&quot;Why?&quot; Eva still avoided the other&#39;s gaze. Chachamaru&#39;s movement sensors 
registered a small tremor in her mistress&#39; hands, but chose to ignore it 
as part of her usual temper tantrums, &quot;Why did you let that lying 
bastard&#39;s son save me?&quot; Not half an hour previously, Negi Springfield, 
son of the Thousand master, Eva&#39;s &quot;captor&quot; had saved her from falling 
into the river after the unexpected return of power to the Mahora 
campus. Evangeline gritted her teeth, &quot;Now I owe him a life debt&quot; she 
muttered, absent-mindedly cupping her tea.

&quot;It was unfortunate that mistress lost&quot;, said Chachamaru, simply, and 
moved to return to the kitchen with the empty tray, sensing that the 
worst of the tantrum seemed to have past.

&quot;Come back here, Chachamaru...&quot; Eva made no effort to disguise the 
menace in her voice. Chachamaru stopped and turned round, heading back 
towards the table. Her mistress drained the dregs of her tea in a single 
gulp, and pushed the coffee table away to one side.

&quot;But I was under the impression that Mistress preferred this in bed.&quot; 
The sentence was not an objection, merely a statement, but Eva shot her 
a look anyway.

&quot;I want it now. Get down there you baka robot,&quot; she snapped, as 
Chachamaru knelt down between her legs. &quot;Un&quot;, she grunted, as she felt 
firm hands massage at her sensitive spots and her tension start to ebb 
away. As Chachamaru worked away, Eva&#39;s relaxed, dreamy expression 
suddenly gave way to emo contortion and the robot was pushed away by the 
shoulders.

&quot;OW!&quot; she yelled, &quot;BAKA Robot! Why can&#39;t you even do a simple foot 
massage?&quot; 

Chachamaru&#39;s expression had not changed, but she was definitely in 
apologetic mode.&quot;I&#39;m sorry mistress.&quot; she deadpanned, &quot;it appears that 
during my last service, Hakase seems to have damaged my foot-massage 
subroutines&quot;

Evangeline silently raged on the sofa. &quot;What are you going to do about 
it then, baka-robot?&quot;

Chachamaru ignored the nickname. &quot;I have been researching other human 
relaxation techniques, mistress,&quot; she began.

&quot;Tried all of them,&quot; Eva interrupted, dismissively. &quot;You tried all of 
them on me. Don&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;This is a technique that Mistress has not tried before,&quot; she continued. 
&quot;I was watching an educational documentary on it on British TV.&quot;

Slight interest filtered through Evangeline&#39;s features. She looked up, 
&quot;What&#39;s it called?&quot; she asked. Chachamaru told her. Her eyes grew wide 
as saucers. &quot;That&#39;s...No, Chachamaru, no! You are forbidden to do that 
to me!&quot; She moved to get up from the sofa, but Chachamaru had gotten a 
firm grip on her mistress&#39; flailing arms and pinned them down with 
supernatural strength. &quot;No! Go do it on Sakurazaki! I don&#39;t swing that 
way you baka-robot!&quot; Metal clamps appeared from nowhere and secured 
Eva&#39;s flailing limbs.

&quot;The programme informed me that you would stuggle at first,&quot; 
Chachamaru&#39;s calm features reflected in panicked eyes. &quot;However, the 
after-effects of this particular type of massage seem to be quite 
agreeable, at least, this is what I can gather from the reactions of the 
people involved.&quot; Eva continued to struggle as the android sank down 
until only her long metallic ears were visible.

The lights stayed on in the cabin for much longer than usual that 
evening. Cries of &quot;Ah, ah, that tickles, baka-robot!&quot; and &quot;NO! That&#39;ll 
never fit in there! OAAARG!&quot; could be heard for a good distance around, 
and passers by might overhear a robotic voice apologising for not 
turning on the heating element in her tongue.

Nevertheless, the next morning, a very bemused Negi-sensei was happily 
greeted by a smiling Evangeline McDowell who actually bothered to turn 
up on time for his class. 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re feeling OK after last night, Evangeline-san?&quot; he 
asked.

&quot;Why? Is there something wrong with me being happy?&quot; she grumbled, 
switching back to her usual mood.

&quot;No...no, nothing wrong with that.&quot; protested a still-confused Negi, as 
Chachamaru came up to him and bowed.

&quot;After Mistress&#39; defeat last night, I performed cunnilingus on her from 
2000 hours till 0230 hours this morning,&quot; she explained, in her usual 
deadpan. Evangeline returned to the front and hit her with the largest 
and heaviest English textbook in her desk. &quot;Is there something wrong 
Mistress?&quot;

&quot;BAKA-ROBOT! Don&#39;t say that in front of the class! It&#39;s embarassing!!&quot; 
Evangeline looked round. Most of the girls had gone bright red. Asuna&#39;s 
mouth opened and closed involuntarily but words were somehow beyond her. 
Asakura was furiously scribbling down notes into her journalist&#39;s 
notepad, Negi and Nodoka blankly stared with youthful incomprehension 
and Setsuna and Konoka had quickly excused themselves to &quot;visit the 
bathroom&quot;. Eva stormed out.

Her words echoed down the corridor. &quot;BAKA ROBOT! Stop watching late 
night British TV!&quot;</pre>
