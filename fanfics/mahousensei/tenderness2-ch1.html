This is a sequel to "Tenderness". 
A slight warning: I have never read the manga and know absolutely nothing 
about how Eishun is supposed to be, so please have patience with any 
and all OOC behaviour.<br><br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
When Konoe Eishun arrived unexpectedly 
at the school, his daughter Konoka had been ecstatic to see him. He 
had met with his father-in-law briefly and then snatched both Konoka 
and her constant companion and protector, Setsuna, away from their classes 
for the rest of the day in order to have a pleasant and leisurely dinner 
in the park.<br><br>
Somewhere after the enjoyment 
of the meal and during easy conversation and relaxing in the sun, Eishun 
had dropped the bomb.<br><br>
Suddenly Konoka was not so 
glad to see her dear daddy after all.<br><br>
As things turned out, Eishun 
had not arrived at the school for the sake of his only child, but rather 
for the sake of his student. That part Konoka did not mind, in fact 
it would just have made her happy to know that her father showed that 
he cared for the stoic young warrior that never seemed to realize just 
how deeply she was cherished.<br><br>
Oh no, the problem was <i>why</i> 
Eishun had come to meet Setsuna. Konoka's father had on behalf of 
the Shinmeiryuu come to attend... Setsuna's omiai.<br>
<br>
Setsuna's reaction had been 
to knock herself between the eyes with the hilt of her sword Yuunagi 
and promptly fall off her seat. The dark-haired warrior recovered quickly 
and scrambled back up on her chair, where she proceeded to clutch her 
blade with white fingers and, with a look of wide-eyed horror, stutter 
helplessly in an attempt to speak.<br><br>
As amusing as Eishun found 
the girl's reaction he found his daughter's to be even more so, 
and carefully schooled his face not to betray anything. His daughter, 
having recovered quickly from her moment of open-mouthed disbelief, 
was busy glaring at him dangerously with eyes gone pitch black with 
anger and, Eishun suspected, jealousy. He put an unreadable smile on 
his face, hoping neither girl would notice the amusement glittering 
in his eyes, and pretended not to notice his daughter being hopping 
mad and his young student in a state of shock so severe she could barely 
walk, and ushered them along on the path back to the school.<br>
<br>
Gleefully Eishun spoke of the 
hotel where the meeting was to take place, how he had rented a private 
conference room with a nice view over the ocean, moving on to mentioning 
that it was a pity the meeting could not be held in Kyoto but at least 
it would be a stylish establishment with all the required arrangements. 
His daughter interrupted him in a voice that was pitched noticeably 
darker than usual, and without the easygoing cheer that otherwise was 
Konoka's trademark. <br><br>
"Daddy!" Secretly Eishun 
was waiting for Konoka to stomp her foot as she had done upon the rare 
occasion she as a small child had been very angry. "What do you mean, 
Secchan's omiai? Why would you arrange an omiai for Secchan in the 
first place?"<br><br>
The sound of Konoka's voice 
broke through Setsuna's daze enough for the confused girl to turn 
towards father and daughter with wide eyes, clutching her prized sword 
to her chest as if she had forgotten it was a weapon. Eishun almost 
felt sorry for the confusion he was causing his otherwise so skilled 
and capable student... almost.<br><br>
"Oh Konoka, of course I am! 
You know Setsuna-kun is like a member of the family, and when I was 
approached with this offer for her I realized at once what a splendid 
opportunity it was to ensure for her future prosperity and happiness." 
He beamed at the girls, meaning every word he spoke. He was just not 
revealing all he knew, that was all... and it also did not hurt that 
with that simple statement Eishun had neatly removed any ability Setsuna 
might have had to muster up a protest.<br><br>
Curiously both girls blushed 
at his words, Setsuna with down-turned eyes and a shy if somewhat torn 
expression on her face, and Konoka with a very strange, semi-strangled 
expression that seemed odd indeed for her. Neither girl found their 
voice for a moment, and Eishun took the opportunity to plough on.<br>
<br>
"The meeting will take place 
fairly early tomorrow, so I'm afraid you'll have to come with me 
when we return to your school so we can do our outmost to prepare for 
tomorrow. We are among other things going to go shopping for formal 
attire for you Setsuna-kun, and I have arranged for a tailor to be expecting 
us in roughly an hour's time. Don't worry, you will have some help 
in choosing something suitable for you as one of your friends from class 
has so kindly offered her services for your omiai, to provide that feminine 
touch." Eishun grinned at the girl that stumbled suddenly. "I expect 
we shall be quite busy until the meeting takes place, Setsuna-kun."<br>
<br>
"Daddy!"<br>
<br>
"Erm, M-master?" Setsuna's 
hushed voice gave Eishun the perfect excuse to ignore his glaring and 
adorably pouting offspring for a moment longer. "When you say a friend 
from class, sir, who exactly... ?"<br><br>
"Ah, it is Evangeline-san 
who has so generously offered her aid in your omiai. She is no doubt 
expecting us for the preparations, and of course my honoured father 
does so as well."<br><br>
"DADDY!"<br>
<br>
"Yes princess?" Eishun 
was all pleasant smiles although his daughter was practically gnashing 
her teeth at him. Really, he should not be enjoying her discomfort so 
much, but his sweet-natured child had only thrown temper tantrums at 
very select opportunities, and to witness one now, at this age, especially 
when knowing what he did of the plans his father-in-law had laid out 
for him, it was all going to be a very cherished memory to look back 
at in years to come.<br><br>
"..." Konoka hesitated 
for a moment. "What about me, daddy?"<br><br>
"Hmm? You, my dear daughter?" <br>
<br>
"Yes, me!" Konoka struggled 
with herself internally, on one hand there was a voice screaming that 
if there was any kind of ‘feminine touch' required for <i>her</i> 
Secchan, Konoka would be the one to provide it, and another voice asked 
if it was such a great idea to volunteer to be present when her beloved 
Secchan would be introduced to a potential marriage-partner. "If it 
is alright to bring Eva-san, then why can't I be there too, for Secchan? 
I have been through lots and lots of omiai and I'm pretty sure Eva-san 
hasn't."<br><br>
"Why that is a great idea, 
princess!" Eishun enthused, smirking inside at how well he knew his 
daughter after all. "I am sure Setsuna-kun will be relieved to have 
you by her side through this." Setsuna nodded gratefully although 
she still looked absolutely ready to bolt.<br><br>
"Oh yes, that was true..." 
Eishun feigned having recalled something and put his hand on Konoka's 
shoulder as they walked. "Your grandfather expressed some dissatisfaction 
with your kimono on your latest omiai, I believe, so I brought you a 
bolt of fabric with me from Kyoto to make a new one. I am certain we 
will manage to find a tailor willing and able to fit you and have the 
kimono finished by morning."<br><br>
He smiled down at his daughter, 
for the moment only thinking of how pretty she would be in the pale 
fabric with the cherry blossom pattern that he had selected for her. 
Konoka nodded in acceptance although she was bewildered as to what exactly 
was wrong with the green outfit she had worn for her latest omiai, and 
why her grandfather had never mentioned to her that he disliked it. 
The matter was unimportant anyway, since her sole purpose during one 
of her own omiai was to get out of them as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
"Well, Setsuna-kun... I am 
supposed to tell you a little about the person you are going to meet 
tomorrow. This person is of a prestigious family, is of your own age-group, 
intelligent and does well in school..." Eishun led them up the gravel 
path towards the buildings, pretending not to notice how his daughter's 
scowling glare returned with his words. "...well-liked, popular, has 
a likeable personality... ah, I suppose I said that already."<br>
<br>
Setsuna looked if possible 
even more pale.<br><br>
"Don't worry Secchan." 
Konoka linked her arm with Setsuna's, a determined look on her face. 
"You just have to appear, sit and be bored for a while, and then you 
tell them ‘no'."<br><br>
Their eyes met and Konoka spoke 
softly, her voice and demeanour taking on a protective tone. "I'll 
be right there next to you, I won't let anything strange happen to 
you Secchan."<br><br>
In her father's direction 
she said "Daddy, we'll go along with this meeting tomorrow, but 
that's it. If Secchan doesn't like this guy you've found, you 
have to promise not to set her up on any more omiai... ok daddy?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I only had Setsuna-kun's 
best interests in mind." Eishun feigned some surprise. "But if that 
is what you wish, then once this omiai is over I will not force you 
through another, Setsuna-kun."<br><br>
He turned to face the girls 
for a moment, flashing them the wide and amused smile that he had been 
fighting to keep off his face. "But did I say that the omiai was with 
a man? How careless of me. Naturally the person hoping for a good match 
with Setsuna-kun is a young lady."<br><br>
Both girls gasped, froze in 
place, and turned beet red.<br><br>
"Now now, what kind of teacher 
would I be if I had not realized such an obvious thing about my favourite 
student?" Eishun chided gently and made for the entrance for the building. <br>
<br>
As he opened the door he threw 
a smile over his shoulder "And Setsuna-kun? This young lady has a 
reputation of being quite a beauty."<br><br>
--- <br><br>
It was late in the evening 
when Konoka finally made it back to her dorm room, having since the 
startling revelation regarding her father's purpose there and his 
intentions for her Secchan had found herself in flurry of activities 
that, besides just plain being annoying, kept her from her black-haired 
companion save for a look shared in passing. She had stopped by Secchan's 
room before staggering to her own, but the young warrior had yet to 
return, most likely still being run ragged by Konoka's father and 
grandfather and their crazy ideas.<br><br>
With a deep, heartfelt sigh 
Konoka threw herself face first on her bed, weakly acknowledging her 
roommates surprised greetings with a wave of her hand, still processing 
the day's events internally.<br><br>
Since her grandfather had insisted 
that Konoka wear a new kimono for Setsuna's omiai if she were to attend 
it, Konoka had spent nearly all what remained of her day first in search 
of a tailor able to do the work on such short notice, and then being 
fitted and otherwise involved in the making of her outfit. A rare vain 
streak had surfaced when Konoka realized that the obi she had worn with 
her previous kimono would not be a good match for this new one, and 
with a sudden and desperate need to look her very best Konoka had spent 
a good amount of time purchasing one that would.<br><br>
Making arrangements with the 
hairdresser for early the next morning also took time, and during the 
visit she decided that new hair ornaments were in order to further go 
along with her new outfit, in short Konoka ran through the shopping 
district like a crazy woman until the last stores were closed.<br>
<br>
Once returned to the campus, 
the young heiress was tired to the bone, confused, upset and just a 
bit heartsick. It had been confusing at first, this fierce need to make 
sure she would look nothing short of the very best she could, and her 
impulse to put such effort into her appearance when she never did more 
than absolutely necessary for any of her own omiai. It came to her after 
a while though, a realization accompanied by the echo of her father's 
comment about the girl that was <i>out to steal her Secchan!</i> going 
to be presented as a possible match for Secchan.<br><br>
She had a reputation of being 
a great beauty, daddy had said. And suddenly Konoka just knew she could 
not afford to be anything short of stunning herself, because... there 
was that nagging doubt eating at her heart. What if this person was 
really as pretty <i>what if Secchan thought she was really pretty, what 
if Secchan liked her more</i> and likeable like daddy said?<br>
<br>
A tiny voice in her head, a 
voice that sounded eerily like a certain cigarette-smoking panty thief, 
told Konoka to just run to wherever Secchan was, tackle her to the floor 
and shower her with kisses until no-one else mattered.<br>
<br>
Konoka lifted her head to send 
a brief glare in Chamo's direction. That plan didn't work if she 
didn't know where Secchan was, anyway.<br><br>
The frustrated scream Konoka 
belted out into her pillow had both Asuna and Negi jump and look at 
one another with wide, almost frightened eyes. A small gesture from 
Asuna and Negi dashed off into the tiny kitchen to prepare some tea 
while Konoka's long-time roommate and friend sat down on the bed next 
to the prone girl.<br><br>
"Konoka? What's wrong?" 
The lanky redhead patted Konoka's shoulder, managing to coax the brunette 
to turn around and sit up. The expression on her friend's face only 
managed to turn concern into alarm however. "W-what? What is it?"<br>
<br>
In fits and starts Konoka told 
her friends what had happened, her story gaining momentum as she spoke 
until Asuna had to snatch back the mug Negi had given Konoka before 
they were all wearing the tea that was being sloshed about with Konoka's 
agitated movements.<br><br>
"Oh Asuunaa... what if Secchan 
likes her more!" Konoka wailed at last into a pillow taken hostage 
after the mug had been plucked from her grasp. Soft sobbing and shaking 
shoulders followed, causing the bewildered Asuna to scramble to hug 
her crying friend.<br><br>
Negi on the other hand paled 
and scrambled about putting all the materials for his experiments – 
and other liquids – securely out of immediate sight and reach. Asuna 
spared the boy a half-hearted glare, but couldn't be bothered to argue 
at the moment.<br><br>
"There, there..." She patted 
Konoka on the back awkwardly, trying to sound comforting. "I'm sure 
that's not possible. Setsuna thinks the world of you, you know."<br>
<br>
"...really?" Konoka stopped 
sniffling to give Asuna an intense stare that made the other girl fidget.<br>
<br>
"Y-yeah..." Asuna wondered 
just what she had gotten into. "So, uh, Setsuna's looking to get 
married, then?" <i>Oops, that was very much the wrong thing to say.</i><br>
<br>
"NO!" The wet dark brown 
eyes narrowed dangerously. "This isn't Secchan's idea! She had 
no idea about all of this, someone just approached daddy and he didn't 
know better and..." Konoka trailed off into dark mumbles that Asuna 
was sure she didn't want to hear.<br><br>
"I don't know how daddy 
could do this!" Konoka complained suddenly, clutching her pillow tighter 
while her lower lip trembled pitifully. "Doesn't he know that Secchan 
is... that Secchan is... Secchan..."<br><br>
"Secchan is <i>my</i> Secchan!" <br>
<br>
Silence followed the plaintive 
cry, in which Konoka seemed to finally unwind some, merely sitting there 
hugging the pillow with Asuna scratching her head as she sat beside 
her friend. Negi tried to be as quiet and unnoticeable as possible in 
order not to interrupt their talk, knowing himself to be far out of 
his depth in a conversation that had veered into the dangerous area 
of relationships and emotions.<br><br>
"Well..." Asuna said carefully 
after a while. "I suppose I'm not entirely surprised. The two of 
you always seemed... almost like you were dating, or something."<br>
<br>
Instead of correcting Asuna 
on her assumption Konoka found herself asking instead "Does that... 
bother you?"<br><br>
Asuna flashed a wide lopsided 
grin and leaned the side of her head against Konoka's. "Me? Nah, 
of course not! I... nah. I wouldn't be." She hugged Konoka who smiled 
for the first time since entering the room and hugged back. <br>
<br>
"I always kinda thought the 
two of you made a cute couple." The last bit came with a wink that 
made Konoka's smile widen a bit and gave the girl a rather pleased 
look. "So... you're going to be dressed to knock Setsuna's socks 
off tomorrow, huh?"<br><br>
"I'll try." The usual 
twinkle was returning to dark brown eyes. "And that means I should 
really go to sleep if I don't want to arrive at the meeting with my 
eyes bloodshot and with dark rings around them."<br>
<br>
"Good thinking." Asuna 
chuckled slightly. "Anything I can help with though?"<br>
<br>
And there was. Asuna promised 
to make sure Konoka got out of bed the same time as Asuna herself did 
next morning, no matter what it took. It was a promise she fulfilled 
with little difficulty as the nervous Konoka practically flew out of 
bed on her own accord when the alarm rang, but nonetheless Asuna kept 
Konoka company, full of cheer and pep-talk, on the way into town before 
Asuna had to go deliver her newspapers.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
The morning flew by in a hectic 
flash, and far too soon for her frazzled nerves Konoka found herself 
carefully walking through the lobby of the hotel that, as it turned 
out, was located suspiciously close to campus grounds. An elevator ride 
later and Konoka was performing a last critical survey of her appearance 
in a full-length mirror in the hallway outside of the conference suite 
where the omiai was going to be held.<br><br>
She looked... pretty, Konoka 
decided, the kimono with its hues of pink, pale pink and white was actually 
quite a bit more flattering than its predecessor, her hair had been 
brushed until it shone before being partially done up in an elaborate 
style accentuated by the pink, white, and red wood hair ornaments. Would 
it be enough? <br><br>
Normally Konoka was not a person 
prone to vanity although she was well aware of the fact that she was 
an attractive girl. Enough people had praised her beauty over the years 
for her to be cognisant of this, but until recent events it had not 
been something she had concerned herself with. With her Secchan summoned 
to an omiai however, her appearance was of outmost importance... Konoka 
was going to do whatever she could to ensure that her beautiful black-haired 
warrior's eyes were firmly fixed on her where they belonged.<br>
<br>
The possessive nature of her 
thoughts made Konoka blush slightly for a moment, but she was quickly 
shaken from her contemplation when the doors in front of her opened 
and Chachamaru of all people appeared to escort Konoka inside.<br>
<br>
The main room was empty save 
for being lavished with furniture, the meeting instead being held in 
the somewhat smaller and more traditionally decorated room beyond that 
and facing the glass balcony, and it was there Konoka found the others 
waiting.<br><br>
Five people were seated at 
the low table, and Konoka scanned the faces quickly, unconsciously searching 
for her unknown rival. There was grandpa, Miss Minamoto from school, 
and opposite them daddy, Eva-san and... Secchan.<br><br>
Everything else just faded 
away when the two girls got a good look at one another.<br>
<br>
Secchan was dressed in white 
and blue, her glossy black hair pulled back in a different type of ponytail 
than the one she usually wore and tied with a long narrow blue ribbon. 
Even sitting down she managed to cut an impressive figure in her new 
outfit, and Konoka felt herself blush slightly just looking at her handsome 
Secchan.<br><br>
Whatever concerns Konoka might 
still have held regarding her own appearance were completely dispelled 
with Secchan's more than satisfactory reaction upon seeing her. The 
young warrior's eyes grew wide as saucers, and with a sudden violent 
jerk Secchan grabbed hold of the person nearest her, apparently completely 
without noticing. Evangeline cursed under her breath but otherwise said 
nothing as she discreetly pried the death-grip off her dress jacket 
and, in a tiny gesture of kindness that she was not exactly known for, 
carefully returned the hand to its owner's lap.<br>
<br>
The smile that Konoka gave 
her Secchan as she made her way towards the empty seat in front of the 
other girl was a particularly sweet one, and it made Secchan blurt something 
out in a longing tone of voice that brought a fierce blush to the shy 
girl's cheeks.<br><br>
 "So beautiful..." Secchan 
breathed before catching herself and, deeply embarrassed, avoided facing 
the looks of the people seated at the table by staring intently at her 
hands.<br><br>
Konoka blushed as well, pleased, 
and giggled softly with happiness. "Thanks Secchan." The warmth 
of her tone drew Secchan's gaze back up towards herself as if Secchan 
just couldn't help it. "And you look... <i>gorgeous</i>."<br>
<br>
Evangeline cleared her throat 
and smirked at her blushing classmates. "Now that we're all here, 
shall we get this meeting started?"<br><br>
<i>That</i> caught Konoka's 
attention.<br><br>
"We're all here?" She 
looked around her, noticing for the first time that there were no other 
spaces left by the table now that she had taken her seat. "But... 
what about..." Secchan looked as bewildered as Konoka felt.<br>
<br>
Next to Konoka Minamoto Shizuna 
spoke up. "I hope you do not mind that I am here Konoka-chan. The 
principal asked for my aid in representing you for this omiai, apparently 
the principal felt a woman's perspective was needed."<br>
<br>
"Representing... me?" <br>
<br>
From opposite end of the table 
Eishun cut in, grinning widely as he was speaking to the equally confused 
Setsuna. "So, Setsuna-kun, didn't I promise that the young lady 
would be a beauty?" <br><br>
The two girls stared at one 
another as if the other would provide some clue as to what was going 
on. Then, as if on cue, both sets of dark brown eyes widened in comprehension.<br>
<br>
"<i>Me</i>!" Konoka's 
hands flew to her face in excitement. "Oh daddy, are you saying that 
you want <i>me</i> to marry Secchan?"<br><br>
When Eishun chuckled softly 
and nodded at his practically squealing daughter, Konoka immediately 
turned towards the cheerfully grinning old man that unbeknownst to her 
had orchestrated the whole event. <br><br>
"May I, grandpa? May I really?"<br>
<br>
"Setsuna-kun would make an 
excellent partner for you, and you have my blessing." Konoemon said 
in an attempt at sounding at least somewhat dignified in the face of 
his precious granddaughter's overwhelming happiness. Internally he 
was already patting himself on the back for a job well done.<br>
<br>
Big brown eyes watered up as 
Konoka turned to face Secchan again, biting her lip and subtly beginning 
to bounce in place. Finally with a shriek of joy Konoka could no longer 
hold back and bolted to her feet, rounded the end of the table, and 
launched herself at the seated Secchan. Suddenly flattened against the 
floor the black-haired girl still managed to instinctively catch her 
precious ojousama in her arms as they went down.<br><br>
"YES! Oh YES!" And then 
Konoka enthusiastically pressed her lips to those of her beloved Secchan, 
eagerly demonstrating her love and her joy in a prolonged kiss. <br>
<br>
Eventually the world filtered 
back in, and it was accompanied by giggling and several people clearing 
their throats. The two flew apart, or rather Setsuna flew upright and 
away from Konoka, whom happily scooted after her and attached herself 
to the violently blushing girl's arm.<br><br>
"Alright then, like I said 
before... let's get this started." Evangeline said, smirking slightly 
at her classmates before focusing on the people facing her. Konoemon 
began laying out the usual type of thing, and so the cumbersome process 
of planning Konoka and Setsuna's future began.<br><br>
Except of course that neither 
girl heard a single word.<br><br>
Konoka was leaning heavily 
on the other girl, looking up at her beloved Secchan with such utter 
adoration in her eyes it completely stole Secchan's breath away. Which 
was alright since when Secchan's eyes followed the path one of her 
hands were lightly tracing down Konoka's face until it reached her 
lips, it was as if a magnet had been turned on, irresistibly pulling 
them together... and Secchan breathed in a puff of hot air slipping 
directly from Konoka's lips...<br><br>
"EXCUSE me!" Evangeline 
rapped her hand against the table loudly in order to get Konoka and 
Setsuna's attention. "Are we boring you terribly with planning how 
to get the two of you married?" The small blonde sounded somewhat 
sickly sweet and she was rolling her eyes at them.<br>
<br>
Blushing and apologizing the 
young couple straightened out and faced the table. It seemed they had 
missed quite a lot while being engrossed in each other, as somehow the 
usual details already seemed to have been hammered out – neither girl 
knew that those details had in fact been decided upon beforehand, in 
a lengthy discussion between Konoemon and Eishun in which Evangeline 
had butted in and taken it upon herself to represent Setsuna's interests 
– leaving a curious kind of negotiation procedure performed by Evangeline 
and Minamoto Shizuna that left even the instigator of the omiai watching 
silently in awe.<br><br>
"Evangeline-san, I believe 
we can agree that a wedding, should one occur, will be held in Kyoto 
unless somehow arrangements cannot be made for all involved to be transported 
there, in which case it will take place in Mahora." Shizuna stated, 
apparently finishing a conversation Evangeline had stopped to bring 
Setsuna and Konoka to attention.<br><br>
"If you can assure me that 
this arrangement will include a vampire and a robot, I'll concede." 
Noticing the surprised glances from her two classmates Evangeline added 
gruffly in an aside "Don't get me wrong, I'm just trying to make 
sure I get a vacation to Kyoto again in a couple of years."<br>
<br>
When the two girls nodded obediently 
at her words Evangeline gave them a long, somewhat mischievous look 
before addressing Shizuna again. "What about living arrangements? 
If they get engaged I think the least they can ask is to get to share 
a dorm-room."<br><br>
"I'm sure that is a reasonable 
request, however we must have Konoka-chan's reputation in mind. Living 
with her fiancée years before the marriage is quite... unorthodox. 
Should word come out..."<br><br>
Evangeline snorted. "How 
will anyone know if they just live in the same corridor or if they live 
in the same room? Besides, there will be rumours regardless..."<br>
<br>
Konoka gasped and interrupted 
the bargaining process. "I can get to share a room with Secchan?" 
She immediately turned shimmering large brown eyes on her grandfather. 
"Grandpa, I want to live with Secchan! Can I, please?"<br>
<br>
Shizuna tried to hide her chuckle 
behind a hand, while Evangeline just shook her head and smirked. "You're 
ruining our fun, you know?"<br><br>
"Hmm... unless my son-in-law 
wants to protest it I suppose that can be arranged, although it will 
take a while." Konoemon couldn't help grant his precious granddaughter's 
wish, and besides, he knew her well enough to know that now that the 
idea had been planted Konoka would be living with Setsuna no matter 
what Konoemon allowed or not.<br><br>
When nothing was heard from 
Eishun but an approving and amused mumble, Evangeline volunteered to 
help Konoemon arrange the living situation later on. Shizuna picked 
up the next item on the agenda.<br><br>
"Now that the living situation 
has been seen to I believe you could concede the name issue. It would 
be preferable if Setsuna-kun had her last name changed to Konoe at least 
before the engagement becomes official."<br><br>
Whatever Evangeline was to 
have countered with was interrupted by Konoka.<br><br>
"Secchan, are you ok with 
changing your name?" She turned to take a closer look at her beloved. 
"Se-Secchan!"<br><br>
The black-haired girl had turned 
a shade of deep burgundy which just could not be healthy, especially 
not for someone whose natural complexion was so fair. On top of that 
her eyes, which shone a sickly surreal white against the redness of 
her face, were unfocused and swivelling as if the she had already fainted 
in her seat and just forgotten to fall over.<br><br>
Setsuna and Konoka were quickly 
excused and helped out on the balcony where Konoka could keep Setsuna 
company as the fresh air might help her recover. The rest of the group 
would continue the conversations just fine without them, and it was 
clear that young Setsuna would not be able to take much more.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later, conversation 
inside the room came to a halt once more.<br><br>
"Konoka!" Eishun called 
to his daughter, the open door to the balcony letting his voice reach 
her quite easily. "You realize that you and Setsuna-kun are standing 
in front of a wall-wide <i>window</i>, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"Then don't <i>watch </i>
us, daddy!"<br><br>
