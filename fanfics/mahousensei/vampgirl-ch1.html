<h1>Vampire Girl</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wdv.html">WdV</a><br> </h2>
<p>	Vampire girl, Evangeline A.K. McDowell (Eva) and as always her side kick robot girl 
Chachamaru Rakuso were on their front porch swing looking over a plan to give Negi a little  
more aggressiveness to deal with on his next Magic training lesson from Eva when Chachamaru 
looked over at Eva a little more inquisitive than usual. She ask, “Master, why are you 
always rough with Negi when his father was the one that put his spell on you in the first 
place?</p>

<p>	 Negi is not like his father at all, he wouldn’t even finish me off when he had his 
best chance. He even returned his arrow spell to himself rather than harm me. I think Negi 
is really a nice boy, very kind in fact. I’m sure his father would have shown up here 
earlier but like you’ve already suspected for some time now, he probably isn’t alive now 
anyway. But then maybe Negi could somehow figure out which spell his father used on you back 
then if you go easier with his training here. Then the two of you could talk out removing 
your spell, which would be the best anyway I think now Master.” </p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Eva rose up a little and let go from the papers they held, leaned back to rest a bit 
on the swing back and looked out across the short field in front of her home almost in a 
daze. Finally said “Yes Negi is different from his father, he always tries to find a simple 
solution acceptable to everyone on anything rather than hurt them or their feeling. Not like 
his father, just blurt out his limited number of magic spell command decided usually in his 
pathetic rage at me when I had basically given up already but he didn’t listen to me then or 
ever.” </p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	“Years ago I was in love with him, “Nagi”, Negi’s father but over the years now I 
really questioned my feelings then too. He said he would return some day if I remain a good 
little Vampire to remove his spell on me but I’ve been good and I haven’t seen him in years 
now. Yes in the last couple of years now I really question if he is still alive which means 
that I’ll remain here forever without him to remove his own spell if Negi don‘t have any 
luck figuring it out.” </p>

<p>	</p>
<p>	Chachamaru said, “Of course you could always use Negi’s blood to remove the spells 
too, his next blood kin but Master, I don‘t really think you would risk hurting Negi for 
that now either, would you?” </p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Eva looked at Chachamaru, said, “Robot girl will you please call me Eva, we are much 
closer friends than “Master” you know.” </p>

<p>	Chachamaru said, “Yes Master I will but will you please call me Chachi now as well 
too, please?”  </p>

<p>	Eva looked at Chachamaru a minute, smiled and nodded yes then said, “Sure Chachi, 
and you call me Eva from now on too, deal?”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Eva turned to look at Chachi, said, “you are my best friend and my partner so I hope 
you don’t laugh at me when I say I’m just like all the other girls in class 2-A, When I look 
at Negi I just melt, it’s almost like Negi and his mild sincere calmness just melted away 
all my anger and vengeance to all man for what they’ve done to us girls for years for no 
reason.” </p>

<p>	“When I’m near him I even lose my desire to be Evangeline, the most powerful Vampire 
in the world anymore, the anger is no longer there when I’m near him, and yes Negi is a very 
special person period. I find myself wanting to walk up to him and just kiss him like all 
the other girls now too and that’s not like me at all so yes, maybe I am in love with him 
too in a mild sort of way. Yes I believe I’d rather remain here and as I am now than to hurt 
him by sucking all his blood. Now I believe this life here with you and all the other girls 
isn‘t as bad as I like to make it sometimes seem.” </p>

<p>	Chachi took Eva’s hand in hers and looked into her eyes, said, “But you can suck 
mine Evangeline.”</p>

<p>	Eva kind of pulled her hand back with a surprised look, said, “Eva, just (Eva) and 
you are a metal robot and I don’t think you have any blood anyway.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Chachi pulled Eva’s hand back to her lap again, said, “Just Chachi please.” With a 
slight smile now Chachi said, “Yes I’m a robot but I do have feeling, even emotional feeling 
the Robotics Lab. programmed into me but your own human spell on me did most of my real 
emotions of true love and feelings. Yes I even have feeling for Negi too just like you but 
I’m just a metal robot and would never turn his head to look at me so my feelings are of no 
use to anyone, well other than you, my feeling are for you My Master Eva.”</p>

<p>	Chachi continued, “Just like you now I’ve been here for years too and I feel the 
loneliness just like you Eva but with us two together all the time, I’m not as lonely 
because we are still together. We are lonely but we are partners together, we do have each 
other you remember and what I mint a while ago, you can suck mine. I have no blood but I am 
here for you to do with or to have me do for you whatever you would like my lady. We are 
partners, we are family together too. I have noticed you mellowing out after Negi got here, 
well I have too. Even for a robot, me, Negi looks pretty good to me too but I also know I‘ll 
never have him, I‘ll never have anyone, I‘m just a metal robot and of no good use to anyone 
it seems.”</p>

<p>	Eva put her arm around Chachi’s waste and pulled her a little closer, said, “You’re 
important to me young lady, we’re partners remember. But as much as I hate to say, I 
wouldn’t have much of a chance with Negi either with his number 1 flame Asuna living with 
him anyway, she’s got him wrapped around her little finger and he loves it too but you can 
also see the love for her in his little beady eyes as well.  Then number 2 &amp; 3 flames, 
Nodaka and Yue living right next door too, but as of here lately, I think even they see that 
Negi heart belongs to no one except Asuna. I seen the two of them really close the other 
night and I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t an official couple the way it looked to me 
and why not, they do make a cute couple especially now that they can’t have Negi, either of 
them.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p>	“Even though Konoka and Setsuna have never really showed much interested in Negi as 
a potential boy friend, I’m sure they would still jump at the chance to get him even though 
they are living together now and are even more a cute little loving couple than even Yue and 
Nodaka now, can’t keep their hands off each other anywhere they go. No real chance for 
anyone else to get him period. Even if by some miracle Negi would like or maybe even love me 
somehow, I could never let it continue. I would never suck enough of his blood to remove 
Nagi‘s spell and I couldn‘t hurt him by me watching him grow old and I remain a 13 year old 
high school girl forever, although I would certainly nibble on his ears and cute nose a 
little.”</p>

<p>	 “I felt so sorry for Negi when Asuna died on her 14<sup>th</sup> birthday; she was 
already so much a part of his life. When he said she went out at the stroke of midnight, I 
wanted to tell him then that that could have only happened by a very strong spell more than 
likely by the devil himself but for what reason, why? No matter how it happened though with 
us all working together we got her back for him.”</p>

<p>	Eva gently placed her hand on Chachi’s cheek, said, “Well with both of us going to 
be just like we are now forever it seems, we might as well be real partners in life too, 
right? How do you feel about a girl partner the rest of your life Chachi? I think we‘re 
already stuck together no matter what anyway.”</p>

<p>	Extremely gentle for the metal robot, Chachi placed both hands to Eva’s cheeks and 
eased into those lovely lips of Eva with a kiss as soft as a kittens touch, held there by 
Eva now finally to let go and back away some to breath. </p>

<p>	Chachi with real tears in both lovely blue eyes, said, “You know I’ve wanted to do 
that for many years now Master, I mean Eva. I love you Evangeline, The most Powerful Vampire 
in this world, I do love you my lovely Vampire lady, now and forever.”</p>

<p>	Very unusual for Eva, she even had tears in her sparkling green eyes looking into 
the beautiful bright blue eyes of Chachi, said, “Yes we’ve both been lonely for a number of 
years and I can’t help but believe that Negi even has the power to open hearts and bring 
them together, even ours now finally. Yes I’ll admit to you now that I’ve had my eyes on you 
too my lovely little robot girl, I mean Chachi my love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Chachi smiled, said, “Yes I’ve been in love with you for years too but I just 
couldn’t tell you as a robot but you’ve really changed too. </p>

<p>	Eva smiled to say, “For a metal robot you sure look beautiful to me so what are you 
doing for about the next hundred years or so young lady? How about a few of the romantic 
spells I placed on you, would you like to try a few tonight and every night from now on my 
love?”</p>

<p>	Eva Continues smiling, says, “And Negi, no matter who you’re with tonight or where, 
I love you too my very special (little boy), Thank you love.”
