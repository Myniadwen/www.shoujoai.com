This is a sequel to "Tenderness 
2". A slight warning: Like with previous parts, please have patience 
with any and all OOC behaviour.<br><br>
------------------------------<br><br>
After the end of what had been 
her own omiai Sakurazaki Setsuna still would not have been able to clearly 
describe what had occurred during it. The last twenty-four hours were 
a blur filled with shocking revelations, outrageous events, and of being 
ordered around, and she had still to get her bearings. Two things were 
very clear through it all, however, and that was the image of her beautiful 
ojousama in her new kimono, and the other the sensation of Kono-chan's 
weight and warmth and lips when they kissed.<br><br>
Which proved right there that 
everything must be but a long, elaborate dream. Any moment now Setsuna 
would wake up and the dream, the happiness, would drift away. She would 
be Setsuna the unworthy again, destined to love and watch over her ojousama 
from afar.<br><br>
Pale fingers traced with wistful 
longing over lips where Setsuna imagined she could still feel Kono-chan's 
warmth.<br><br>
The odd thought struck her 
that if this was just a dream, then what perversity in her was it that 
had imagined Evangeline-san as Setsuna's guide and aide? The diminutive 
blonde had been present in the principal's office when Master Eishun 
had guided her there, and after all other aspects of conversation had 
been over with, Evangeline-san had told all present that she had gone 
through Setsuna's things and come to the realization that not even 
the robotic Chachamaru had such an abysmal wardrobe, and that she needed 
to amend that.<br><br>
Chachamaru, naturally present 
wherever her Master was located, interjected that she had quite an extensive 
wardrobe since her Master enjoyed dressing her up, causing the tiny 
vampire to give a flustered rant before calming down enough to issue 
orders. In the end Evangeline and Chachamaru had met up with Setsuna 
and Master Eishun after the two latter had spent an hour or more with 
a tailor that was going to make an outfit for Setsuna to wear by morning, 
and Evangeline had badgered Setsuna into trying on various items and 
clothing in all the stores in town, most of which Setsuna was more than 
happy to forget. The seemingly endless shopping spree under Evangeline's 
control resulted in a mountain of bags and boxes that nearly had Setsuna 
throwing a panic fit, but the vampire had of course insisted that Setsuna 
absolutely needed every single item bought.<br><br>
Evangeline and Chachamaru had, 
when they had returned to campus and Setsuna already felt tired beyond 
belief, then proceeded to supervise Setsuna as she put the clothing 
away, Chachamaru painstakingly instructing Setsuna on proper storage 
and caring for what she was handling, and Evangeline thoroughly explaining 
when and how each thing was to be worn.<br><br>
By the time they were done 
it was thankfully time to be present when the principal was given his 
daily report from the guardians of the school, and after that the principal 
and Master Eishun kept Setsuna with them until rather late at night, 
handling paperwork and other matters, as well as having strange conversations 
with her that Setsuna could not quite grasp the significance of.<br>
<br>
Master Eishun and Chachamaru 
had arrived early the following morning, and after a light breakfast 
and brief - and failed - meditation the three of them had gone to 
collect Setsuna's new outfit from the tailor. Chachamaru had helped 
arrange Setsuna's hair in a fashion that Evangeline apparently had 
decided upon, and then they had gone to meet up with said imperious 
blonde and the principal.<br><br>
The car had taken a detour 
to the hotel where the omiai was to take place, coming to a halt a small 
distance behind the hotel in order for Evangeline and Chachamaru to 
get out. Without asking Setsuna nonetheless was informed that the hotel 
had been built on what was technically speaking still part of the school's 
property, and therefore Evangeline could access the smaller rooms attached 
to balconies in the building without crossing the line of her curse. 
It was the way in to these rooms that was a bit tricky, leaving master 
and robotic servant to sneak in from the back as the rest of the group 
drove up to the main entrance.<br><br>
What followed then, essentially 
from the moment Setsuna's adored ojousama stepped through the door, 
was just too surreal. Somewhere along the line Setsuna stopped resisting, 
listening to the voice inside that said that yes, it might all be but 
a dream... but it was a sweet dream, and there were no harm in allowing 
herself to dream it. And so she tried to go along with it, hoping morning 
would stay far, far away.<br><br>
Before she and Chachamaru left 
the building Evangeline had a brief conversation, or rather an order 
to give, with Setsuna on the balcony. Apparently the dinner reservations 
that Setsuna had been told to make in the Konoe name at a rather well-known 
restaurant in town were not, as Setsuna had believed, for Master Eishun 
and ojousama, for when Evangeline all but commanded Setsuna to take 
Kono-chan out on a date the following day that was the place she was 
told to take her date to. Evangeline then sternly told Setsuna to wear 
a certain outfit that the blonde had picked out for that specific purpose, 
and Setsuna had better remember how Evangeline had told her to wear 
it, <i>or else</i>.<br><br>
Kono-chan had clung to Setsuna's 
arm and sighed happily about their ‘first date' after the child-like 
vampire had left, but they were soon after parted as the principal's 
company and Master Eishun's company took separate cars away from the 
hotel. The car Setsuna travelled with took another detour - complete 
with another threatening reminder about the date - to deliver Evangeline 
and Chachamaru to their cottage before returning to the dorms.<br>
<br>
Thus it was that Setsuna was 
now finally in her own room, lying on her back upon the bed staring 
unseeing up at the darkened ceiling, having not bothered turning on 
the lights. She had also forgotten to change out of the clothes she 
had worn to the omiai, having basically just entered and thrown herself 
at the bed, deep in thought.<br><br>
Setsuna did not know that in 
another part of the building, somewhat earlier, the girl that occupied 
her spinning thoughts had rushed back to the room she shared with her 
friends, thrown the door open, and squealing hurled herself at her friend 
and roommate of several years. After being drawn around the room in 
a bouncing kind of dance Asuna had managed to ask what was going on, 
to which the exuberantly happy brunette had declared that she was going 
to get married. The confused red-head had wondered if her friend had 
somehow hi-jacked Setsuna's omiai, and that had started a long and 
surprisingly squealing, and surprisingly detailed, account for everything 
that had happened. <br><br>
The amount of time telling 
her story and answering her friends questions took meant that it was 
quite some time before Asuna's help could be enlisted in removing 
the kimono and restoring hair and general looks to something resembling 
normal, but once that was done a certain Kyoto-born heiress with a big 
smile on her face and with feet that only barely touched the ground 
was happily making her way towards the room where her beloved lay, obliviously 
staring at a darkening ceiling.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
Konoka bounded up to her precious 
Secchan's door and not so much knocked on it as she declared in a 
loud voice that she was coming in, leaving the startled girl inside 
to just barely manage to scramble to a sitting position before she entered.<br>
<br>
"Secchan!" Konoka blinked 
at the slight dusk in the room, but continued undeterred. "Can I turn 
on the light?"<br><br>
"O-of course, ojousama." 
Setsuna stuttered while trying discreetly to straighten herself out.<br>
<br>
"Mou! Again with the ‘ojousama'..." 
Konoka pouted as she switched on the light, but broke out into a big 
smile as she turned towards Setsuna again. "You know, Secchan, people 
will get the wrong idea if you keep calling your girlfriend ‘ojousama'."<br>
<br>
That said she bounded over 
to the bed to sit down and attach herself to Setsuna's side while 
the other girl blushed furiously.<br><br>
"I-I-I see." Setsuna stuttered 
while glancing shyly at the girl burrowing into her shoulder. "Girlfriend?" 
The last was spoken very softly, Setsuna sounding somewhat unsure of 
herself.<br><br>
Konoka smiled gently up at 
her blushing love. "Yeah, girlfriend or fiancée, whichever you think 
sounds better Secchan." She stroked the fabric at Setsuna's throat. 
"This looks so very good on you Secchan... you are quite handsome."<br>
<br>
While Setsuna mumbled something 
indistinct in reply Konoka eyed the clothing a second time, this time 
with a slight frown. "Shouldn't you have changed by now though, 
Secchan?"<br><br>
A sheepish look. "...I forgot."<br>
<br>
Konoka chuckled softly. "Yeah, 
we've had quite an eventful day, haven't we?" Gently touching 
a pink cheek before standing up she added "I'll help you change."<br>
<br>
As the suddenly wide-eyed warrior 
was about to stutter a panicked refusal the smiling brunette effectively 
silenced her with a single finger to Setsuna's lips. "Silly Secchan, 
you had help putting it on, didn't you?" Konoka was quite amused 
at her Secchan's bashfulness. "You'll need help to take it off, 
and I'm already here. Now come, stand up and turn around."<br>
<br>
Before Setsuna knew it she 
was standing with her back to Konoka and stripped to the waist save 
for the cloth bindings Setsuna wore around her chest in lieu of a bra. 
Dream or no, this day was apparently all about making Setsuna experience 
new levels of embarrassment, she thought, and did her best to resign 
herself to the constant light-headedness that accompanied one of her 
strong blushes. Oh if only she had not been so terribly prone to them 
in the first place.<br><br>
On her part Konoka was slowly 
coming to realise that for some reason seeing Secchan half-naked now 
was quite different from the several times they had already been naked 
in each other's presence before. It seemed strange that after sitting 
next to one another in the bath in the altogether, yes even helping 
each other with washing hair and such things, that the mere act of undressing 
would be so... <i>intimate and awkward.</i> Although, come to think 
of it, Secchan had always been rather awkward in the bath, ever the 
shy one, and it had been Konoka that had pushed onward enough times 
that the other girl had seemed to get used to it. But why was it so 
different now?<br><br>
Perhaps it was the fact that 
this time they were truly alone. There was no safe buffer of noisy classmates 
with them here, no-one at all present that would hold them back if they...<br>
<br>
Blushing rather badly herself 
Konoka snapped her thoughts away from that track, trying to focus instead 
on the slender figure that was standing so stiffly in front of her, 
and not indulge in somewhat... <i>risqué</i>... daydreams. She chuckled 
a little, charmed at the bright pink of Secchan's ears.<br>
<br>
For someone so strong and competent 
it was always something of a shock to see that once those clothes were 
off, Secchan was actually a quite small and slender girl. Although those 
arms were muscular it was in a lean way, not quite revealing that under 
that flawless pale skin hid the strength to hurl an opponent twice Secchan's 
size across the room, or to catch Konoka's fall in open arms without 
the slightest waver. Mesmerized Konoka wondered what it would feel like 
to touch that soft fair skin and feel the hidden strength underneath...<br>
<br>
It was Secchan's gasp and 
the procession of pink down towards pale shoulders that made Konoka 
realize that she wasn't just imagining what it would feel like to 
run her fingers down Secchan's mostly naked back; she was in fact 
slowly running her fingers down the other girl's spine.<br>
<br>
The strong shudder going through 
Secchan's form at her touch brought out Konoka's more mischievous 
side, and she leaned in towards the bared neck until her breath was 
searing hot on the very base of Setsuna's head. "Are you cold, Secchan?" 
She barely noticed that her own voice had gone suspiciously husky as 
Konoka found herself fighting a sudden urge to fasten her lips to the 
spot where her breath, quite intentionally, had just warmed fair skin.<br>
<br>
"YES!" Setsuna yelped, 
startled and shivering.<br><br>
"Then I'll... warm you 
right up." Konoka giggled and pulled her arms around Secchan's waist, 
pressing herself tightly against the almost bare back. If Secchan had 
been stiff before, at the sudden move she turned absolutely rigid.<br>
<br>
Which was exactly what Konoka 
had counted on as her fingers moved around... and jabbed mercilessly 
at some very ticklish spots.<br><br>
"IIIIIIIIIIIYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAA!" 
The secretly very ticklish girl howled and tried to squirm away from 
the one person who knew this particular secret, but Konoka had a good 
grip and a few really good spots in reach. They ended up on the floor, 
Setsuna trying to block or pull Konoka away but were squealing too hard 
to be able to summon up her usual strength.<br><br>
Then the door was flung open. 
"Setsuna, you sleeping?"<br><br>
The couple on the floor froze, 
Setsuna flat on her back and only half-dressed with Konoka straddling 
her waist, one hand trying to pin Setsuna's arms above her head while 
the other suspiciously much looked as if it was in the middle of undoing 
the straps in Setsuna's hakama.<br><br>
In the doorway the slightly 
stunned-looking Tatsumiya Mana froze as well.<br><br>
Both girls on the floor spoke 
up at once, voices squeaking somewhat as they hastened to explain. "Its 
not what it looks like/We're just..."<br><br>
Mana cut them off with a swiftly 
lifted hand. "Setsuna, we are to meet with the principal before going 
on patrol today." A slight pause. "I will wait for you outside his 
office." And then she was gone, the door closed firmly behind her.<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
When Mana left Setsuna had 
leapt to her feet, realizing that for her fighting companion to seek 
her out before a meeting instead of just joining up with her on the 
way there it meant that Setsuna was already late. She apologized and 
explained in a rush to Konoka, who as it turned out was quite understanding 
and offered to help Setsuna by folding and putting away her clothes 
before leaving, allowing Setsuna to quickly change into her school uniform 
and dash out the door.<br><br>
Although Mana was indeed waiting 
for Setsuna in the corridor outside the office and therefore was unlikely 
to have told the principal anything about what she had walked in on, 
Setsuna still found the way the old man smirked and chuckled when he 
asked her if she had been with Konoka as Setsuna apologized for her 
tardiness to be quite... unnerving. She blushed helplessly, looking 
undoubtedly much more guilty of something, whatever that something might 
be, than she really had any reason to.<br><br>
The meeting itself took quite 
some time and dealt with the various aspects of the work that Setsuna 
and Mana performed for the principal. It also pertained to the proposed 
inclusion of Nagase Kaede as an additional member of the school guardians. 
The proposition had in fact been suggested by Setsuna to begin with, 
with Mana's support, and it had been evaluated for some time before 
Kaede had been approached by the principal. Although nothing of the 
sort was mentioned, Setsuna was left with a sneaking suspicion that 
the principal's sudden desire to expand the guardians, beginning with 
Nagase but with the intention of finding a few additional trustworthy 
martial artists to include as well, had something to do with her dating 
his granddaughter.<br><br>
The meeting came to a halt 
when Evangeline informed them of multiple intrusions of the school boundaries, 
and it was with some relief that Setsuna set out alongside of Mana to 
track down and subjugate whatever had crossed into Mahora territory. 
Fighting, at least, was an old familiar friend for the Shinmeiryuu warrior.<br>
<br>
As things turned out, the intruding... 
entities... were not very strong, but they were many and, which proved 
to be the more difficult part, nearly impossible to track by any of 
the many means available. In the end it was a matter of footwork, Setsuna 
and Mana walking the perimeter over and over, hunting for signs, until 
finally they had located and dealt with all the creatures.<br>
<br>
During lulls in the patrolling, 
of which there were many, Setsuna would upon occasion catch a strange 
glance directed her way from Mana, but the taller woman never brought 
up the subject of what exactly she had walked in on. It was terribly 
unnerving and Setsuna did not know what to do or say in such a situation 
- frankly, she was not even sure she would survive the stuttering 
and blushing embarrassment that bringing up the topic would entail on 
her part, especially with Mana. For a long while Mana had been the only 
friend Setsuna could have claimed to have at Mahora, due to her self-imposed 
distance from everyone in general and Konoka in particular of course, 
and while it was probably a strange kind of relationship it was one 
she valued. In short, she particularly did not relish the prospect of 
looking ridiculous in front of Mana.<br><br>
By the time their job was done, 
darkness had already fallen and it was quite late. Setsuna had rather 
given up on coming up with a way to explain to her companion, and it 
seemed Mana was not going to mention anything. They engaged in a brief 
conversation before saying goodnight, heading out in different directions... 
but Setsuna did not get far.<br><br>
"Setsuna?" Mana's voice 
was just loud enough for Setsuna to hear, and when Setsuna stopped and 
turned around to face her she found that Mana was still turned the other 
way. "I am... happy for you." A simple but heartfelt statement, 
only there were something else in Mana's voice as well. The taller 
woman turned her head, presumably to look at Setsuna over her shoulder, 
but her face was in darkness so Setsuna could not tell. "Hold on to 
what you have, and don't let anything ruin it for you... not even 
yourself."<br><br>
"... Thank you." Setsuna 
answered simply to the retreating back. <i>Not even Setsuna herself? 
Yes... she herself was probably the biggest threat to her own happiness.</i><br>
<br>
Setsuna did not set out to 
walk briskly to the dorms as she usually might have when finishing work 
at a late hour, rather, feeling her body demand rest but her heart fearing 
sleep, Setsuna walked around campus somewhat aimlessly.<br>
<br>
Her wandering took her, quite 
without conscious decision, to the patch of grass directly below Konoka's 
dorm-room window. Surprised at how she had found herself there, Setsuna 
nonetheless remained, silently looking up at the dark square and wishing 
somewhat wistfully that she could have seen Konoka's face.<br>
<br>
But it was late, of course 
Konoka had gone to sleep even if the next day was not a school day... 
if nothing else she would undoubtedly be woken early when Asuna set 
out on some job or other, as always, and would therefore had gone to 
bed at a reasonable hour.<br><br>
So why if she knew this was 
Setsuna standing there in the dark, staring at Konoka's window like 
a lovesick puppy?<br><br>
Suddenly there was movement 
by the dark window. Setsuna watched with something akin to wonder how 
the window opened to reveal a pyjama-clad figure gently lit by the light 
of the rising moon. She could not help but smile when Konoka leaned 
out, her long brown hair falling down like a veil to obscure her face 
until a single graceful movement pulled it aside.<br>
<br>
Konoka had waited up for her.<br>
<br>
It had to be a dream after 
all, Setsuna considered after seeing Konoka attempt to mouth something 
to her since speaking loudly enough that they would hear one another 
would undoubtedly wake up the others, and in a dream... could she not 
indulge? Even if it meant using the things she hated being reminded 
of that she had, even if it meant revealing her ugliness to the one 
whose opinion of her mattered most of all.<br><br>
A quick though fairly pointless 
look around, and then... snowy white wings spread in the moonlight, 
a strong stroke of the same, and Setsuna carefully hovered just below 
Konoka's window.<br><br>
"My beautiful angel..." 
Konoka breathed, such delight in her eyes that for just that moment 
Setsuna could lay aside some of her self-consciousness.<br>
<br>
A pale hand reached out to 
gently run fingers through long brown hair. "Why are you still awake?"<br>
<br>
With a sweet smile Konoka captured 
Setsuna's hand and brought it up to her face. "I couldn't sleep 
until I knew you were alright." The smile dimmed slightly with concern 
for a moment. "You're not hurt, are you?"<br><br>
"No, nothing came close enough 
to touch me." Konoka's skin was warm against Setsuna's night-chilled 
fingers. "You... waited for me." Her voice filled with a sense of 
wonder, hovering closer without meaning to.<br><br>
"Of course."<br>
<br>
Emboldened by the darkness 
that cloaked her and by the surrealism of the moment, Setsuna did something 
she would not have thought she possessed the courage for. In one smooth 
movement she closed the distance, took Konoka in her arms, and kissed 
her... <i>deeply</i>.<br><br>
Konoka's tiny gasp of surprise 
quickly turned into a moan as their tongues met, and within a heartbeat 
she responded enthusiastically, arms coming up to grasp at Setsuna's 
neck and shoulders with one hand at the base of Setsuna's skull and 
the other lodged somewhat possessively into white feathers.<br>
<br>
They kissed for some time before 
parting, both of them somewhat out of breath and unsteady. "<i>Oh 
Secchan!</i>" Konoka gasped. "Secchan, I lo..."<br>
<br>
A throat cleared not entirely 
discreetly from further inside the dark room.<br><br>
"I hate to interrupt, but 
before the two of you do anything... <i>more</i>... let me remind you 
that there are minors in the room. Two of them in fact." Asuna whispered 
at her roommate and her girlfriend. "Plus, you know guys, its getting 
pretty chilly in here... come inside and close the window?"<br>
<br>
The young couple flew apart, 
Setsuna loosing her grip on the window in the process. Deadly embarrassed 
at both her own boldness and at being caught yet again, Setsuna decided 
to bolt. "I-I-I-I should g-go. Please go to sleep, Kono-chan...go-" 
A pair of soft lips interrupted her.  <br><br>
Konoka bestowed her with such 
a loving look that Setsuna went breathless once again. "Goodnight 
angel. Sweet dreams."<br><br>
"Goodnight Kono-chan." 
The barest whisper, then Setsuna let her wings take her away.<br>
<br>
Before coming entirely out 
of range of Setsuna's sharp hearing, the following passage was carried 
by the wind. "So, good kisser huh?" "Oh like you wouldn't <i>
believe</i>! <i>Sigh</i>."<br><br>
With a big grin despite her 
burning cheeks Setsuna uncharacteristically allowed herself a big, fast 
loop up high in the air before setting back on a path to her own room 
for the night.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
Morning arrived far later than 
it should have for one bewildered young warrior always firm about her 
training, and, at least on the second attempt, at about the right time 
for one cheerful little future mage that liked to sleep in when she 
could.<br><br>
It was the day for their big 
first official date, and while Konoka had a vague idea that the general 
concept of a date meant that they should probably not spend the day 
together until the time for the actual date <i>itself</i>, she still 
went looking for her Secchan.<br><br>
She did not find her, not in 
any of the places she looked, and after an hour or two this began to 
bother Konoka, as her Secchan had a habit of stopping by before or after 
training or whatever tasks she had to perform just to check on her. 
When another hour passed by without her precious black-haired protector, 
Konoka got really worried. Was Secchan alright? Had something happened? 
Or was Secchan just avoiding Konoka for some reason?<br>
<br>
Fortunately she came upon the 
twins whom explained to Konoka that Setsuna and Mana had gone with Kaede, 
for some mysterious business-related thing that the two sisters had 
fun speculating over and that Konoka realized must involve the kind 
of work that Setsuna did for her grandfather.<br><br>
The rest of the day until the 
much-awaited date went by fairly quickly, until the time came when Konoka 
was a all but emptying her closet in search of the perfect outfit to 
wear with Asuna patiently attempting to steer the girl to pick one outfit 
and stick with it. Although she tried to help Asuna was not above teasing 
her friend, and so she suggested that Konoka should wear her pyjamas, 
since it had gotten such good results the night before. Neither the 
blushing Konoka nor the grinning Asuna were quite willing to explain 
the joke to Negi though, whom had managed to sleep through the previous 
night's heated little visit.<br><br>
Then finally there was a knock 
on the door, and Konoka - having really <i>just</i> gotten the finishing 
touches on her ensemble <i>quite so</i> - rushed to open it.<br>
<br>
One hand immediately flew up 
in the vicinity of her heart, as the shy-looking girl on the other side 
took Konoka's breath away. Setsuna was dressed in a grey pinstripe 
suit, the fit loose enough that it masked certain telling curves and 
appeared to increase her overall size, with her black hair brushed to 
gleaming and worn loose of its usual ponytail. This androgynous slant 
to her appearance worked only so long as one did not take a close look 
at her face, for Setsuna's features were far too feminine to be mistaken.<br>
<br>
Blushing slightly Setsuna bowed 
at the waist and handed Konoka a single long-stemmed red rose. "H-here 
Kono-chan!"<br><br>
Accepting the rose with a big 
smile Konoka gently urged her Secchan to stand up straight and gave 
her a little peck in thanks. As the smitten girl cooed admiringly over 
her rose Setsuna stared, helplessly tongue-tied at the vision before 
her. The short black dress was of a simple cut and innocent enough for 
a girl of Konoka's age, but it left a fair part of her neck and shoulders 
bare, and with the long chocolate-brown hair done up Setsuna's view 
was unrestricted. Setsuna could feel her ears heating up.<br>
<br>
So distracted was she that 
she did not snap out of her stupor until a flash of light obscured her 
vision. Konoka giggled and leaned in close, posing happily for Asuna 
and her camera... it took the love-addled warrior a moment, however, 
to realize that Asuna was not just arbitrarily out to blind her with 
the flash, but actually taking their picture.<br><br>
It helped Setsuna refocus her 
thoughts, so once the pictures were taken she gently took Konoka's 
hand and nodded slightly at Asuna and Negi in goodbye. "Ready to go, 
Kono-chan?"<br><br>
Carefully handing the rose 
over to Asuna Konoka attached herself to Setsuna's arm and beamed 
at her girlfriend. "Yes, Secchan! I'm ready! Bye Asuna, bye Negi... 
don't wait up if I'm late."<br><br>
Asuna snorted to herself, amused, 
as she watched the couple make their way down the hall for a moment. 
"Don't wait up? I thought this was a dinner-date."<br>
<br>
"Asuna?" Negi looked at 
his older roommate with a serious and concerned expression. "Who will 
make <i>our</i> dinner?"<br><br>
"... DARN IT!"<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
The ride to the restaurant 
had been a quiet one, with Konoka and Setsuna not saying much but instead 
shyly holding hands the whole way. Once out of the car Konoka re-attached 
herself to Setsuna's arm, and Setsuna bravely ignored looks sent their 
way and tried to keep her voice from squeaking when she informed the 
man that greeted them that they had reservations for two.<br>
<br>
They were led to a nice, secluded 
table for two, and so far so good. Then they were given the menus, and 
Setsuna found she did not know what half of the foreign-sounding food 
was, much less what to order. Thankfully Konoka naturally took charge 
and ordered food and drink for the both of them. The waiter lit a candle 
on their table and left them alone to wait for their food to arrive.<br>
<br>
After a moment of silence Konoka 
reached out and took Secchan's hand in hers. "You look so handsome 
today Secchan." Her fingers began gently tracing patterns on the skin 
of Setsuna's wrist.<br><br>
"And y-y-you are so very... 
very..." Setsuna had a hard time finding a word that would describe 
just what a wonder Konoka was, and failing she had to settle for one 
that didn't do the vision in front of her justice. "very beautiful, 
Kono-chan."<br><br>
There was a pleased little 
giggle and a happy smile in response to Setsuna's words, so perhaps 
they were alright anyway. Konoka squeezed Setsuna's hand a little 
and played with her fingers, and after a moment struck up a conversation 
between them that though light and filled with small touches and gentle 
looks was still surprisingly commonplace for them. After a while Setsuna 
found Konoka looking at her with such an expression in dark brown eyes 
that it made all the little hairs on Setsuna's neck stand on end, 
and made her ears feel as if they were on fire.<br><br>
Konoka smiled, a slow, mysterious 
and ever so slightly evil smile and leaned back in her chair somewhat... 
a moment later and Setsuna felt a strange bump against the side of her 
foot. The unusual smile on Konoka's face grew wider at Setsuna's 
confusion, and there was a bump against the other foot.<br>
<br>
By the time food arrived Setsuna 
was thoroughly educated in the art of playing footsie, much to her embarrassment 
and Konoka's delight.<br><br>
Dinner was undoubtedly delicious, 
but Setsuna couldn't taste a bite, and worse, could barely take her 
eyes off Konoka long enough to perform the act of eating. Konoka blushed 
slightly and giggled happily at Setsuna's preoccupation with her, 
and generally wished she was bold enough to do something outrageously 
flirty with her food. Not really finding the courage for that, at least 
for the moment, she settled for joking with her Secchan a little, managing 
to get the other girl to relax a little.<br><br>
Dessert saw them both reliving 
shared childhood memories, reminding each other of various funny and 
endearing anecdotes of their early friendship. When Konoka put her spoon 
down she bestowed Setsuna with another one of those breathtakingly adoring 
looks that made Setsuna's heart hammer in her chest.<br>
<br>
"You were always my hero." 
The words were spoken softly, affectionately, as Konoka found Setsuna's 
hand again.<br><br>
Setsuna frowned and looked 
away. "...no. I failed you."<br><br>
Blinking in surprise Konoka 
leaned forward until she could meet Setsuna's eyes again. "Failed? 
When did you ever fail me?"<br><br>
"I... you... the river..." 
Setsuna found she couldn't even bear to say it and closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
"The river? You mean the 
time when you tried so hard to convince me not to go near the creek, 
but I was too stubborn to listen... and when I tripped and fell in, 
like you had warned me I might, you jumped in after me even though neither 
of us could swim." Konoka smiled warmly. "Secchan, you managed to 
keep me mostly above the water until the adults found us even though 
you couldn't swim and you were drowning too."<br>
<br>
She leaned carefully across 
the table until she could touch Setsuna's face. "How can you call 
that failing? If you had been any less brave and selfless I wouldn't 
be here today."<br><br>
"Is there any wonder..." 
Konoka blushed but continued unwaveringly. "...that I never had eyes 
for anyone else?"<br><br>
Wide-eyed and reeling with 
something akin to shock, Setsuna opened her mouth to speak... only to 
be interrupted by the waiter stepping up to their table. Immediately 
the moment was broken and the girls flew apart, blushing strongly. The 
elderly man who was waiting on their table took in their appearances 
and knew he had accidentally interrupted something, and since there 
was nothing else he could do he just did his best to be quick about 
his business.<br><br>
Impulsively Konoka asked "Do 
you want to dance, Secchan?"<br><br>
Big near-black eyes looked 
absolutely panicked in reply. "I can't dance!" A breath, during 
which Setsuna calmed herself slightly. "I am sorry Kono-chan, but 
I don't know how to dance."<br><br>
"Hmm..." Konoka looked 
at her apologetic fiancée. "What do you say then about us leaving 
here, going back, and... going for a walk?"<br><br>
Setsuna looked so relieved 
it was almost comical. "Yes, Kono-chan. We can go for a walk."<br>
<br>
Hiding a smile at her Secchan's 
adorable reactions Konoka turned to the waiter to settle the bill, and 
not long after the two girls were standing outside in the cooling evening 
air waiting for their car to arrive to take them home.<br>
<br>
Blushing slightly for the umpteenth 
time that evening, Setsuna took off her jacket and draped it over Konoka's 
bare shoulders. Konoka just about had time enough to look up in surprised 
gratitude when Setsuna's arm followed, carefully settling around Konoka's 
back.<br><br>
With a happy sigh Konoka put 
her own arms around Setsuna's waist and leaned against her with her 
head on a white-clad shoulder.<br><br>
Setsuna thought to herself 
that she wouldn't mind if that car would take just a little while 
longer...<br><br>
--- <br><br>
The ride back was surprisingly 
quick, which Setsuna figured had more to do with the fact that Konoka 
sat glued to her side with her head on Setsuna's shoulder, rather 
than the driver speeding more than on the ride to the restaurant. In 
hardly any time at all they were standing on the sidewalk watching the 
car disappear down the road.<br><br>
"Its getting dark... do you 
still want to go for a walk, Kono-chan?" Setsuna was concerned, she 
herself wanted very much to prolong the evening in whatever way Kono-chan 
preferred, but what she wanted was of course not important compared 
to Kono-chan's safety. "It might not be safe out without my sword."<br>
<br>
Konoka smiled brightly. "I'm 
always safe with you, Secchan."<br><br>
A gentle yank on Setsuna's 
arm started them both walking slowly on a path away from the paved areas 
and out onto the grassier parts of the school. Setsuna had to make another 
attempt at explaining why Konoka might want to reconsider, feeling it 
was her duty to do so.<br><br>
"But I don't have any weapons 
with me... if we were to get attacked by something..."<br>
<br>
"If we get attacked by something..." 
Konoka pulled a little more. "...you can just scoop me up and we'll 
fly away as fast as we can. Okay?"<br><br>
"Y-yes. I promise." Setsuna 
felt tears sting her eyes a little at Kono-chan's faith and easy acceptance. 
Inside she repeated the old oath of hers to protect her precious one 
no matter what.<br><br>
"Good." The response earned 
Setsuna a tiny kiss on her cheek. "Secchan, are you cold?"<br>
<br>
Realizing that Konoka intended 
to give her back the jacket if she in any way implied that she was Setsuna 
hurried to assure that she was fine, that the evening air was not nearly 
cold enough to bother her. Once convinced her Secchan was not suffering, 
Konoka flashed a playful grin and let go of the hand she was holding. 
"In that case... catch me Secchan!"<br><br>
And off she was, running as 
fast as she could over the grass. Setsuna took a fraction of a second 
before she realized Konoka had dashed away and took up the chase, senses 
suddenly on full alert lest anything dangerous should jump out from 
behind a bush or a tree.<br><br>
But there was nothing there 
but the two of them, and while Setsuna could easily run past her beloved 
Kono-chan she let the other girl remain a step or two ahead of her, 
until Kono-chan slowed down in a nicely secluded glen not that far from 
the school buildings yet still away from prying eyes.<br>
<br>
As soon as Setsuna was close 
enough Konoka spun around and launched herself into Setsuna's arm 
with a bubbling laugh. Impulsively Konoka blurted "Dance with me!"<br>
<br>
"But Kono-chan... I can't 
dance!" Setsuna had something slightly panicked in her voice again.<br>
<br>
"I'll teach you! I'll 
lead, you just have to try to follow me." There was another bright 
smile that Setsuna could not say no to, and in reward, another small 
peck. <br><br>
And dance they did, slowly 
and gingerly with Konoka encouraging Setsuna whom at first was terribly 
self-conscious and somewhat clumsy. Eventually Setsuna managed to relax 
enough to think that this dancing thing was perhaps not so bad at all, 
and as a result they moved a little more gracefully around the grass.<br>
<br>
Finally they came to a stop, 
standing in a loose embrace with Konoka's arms coming up to wrap around 
Setsuna's shoulders. They stood in silence for a while, merely looking 
at one another.<br><br>
"Secchan..." Konoka breathed, 
her expression soft and yearning. "I love you." Gentle fingers caressed 
the side of Setsuna's face. "I always have."<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
Setsuna could not speak, could 
not move, could not <i>breathe</i>. Konoka's tender expression grew 
worried and then distorted and Setsuna could not understand why until 
she heard Konoka's voice, urgent and worried.<br><br>
"Secchan! Secchan, you're 
crying... d-did I say something wrong?" <br><br>
Suddenly she was crushing Konoka 
to her, face buried in the other girl's neck, sobbing helplessly. 
Konoka was somewhat stunned but still tried her best to comfort, quite 
alarmed at her beloved Secchan's reaction to her declaration of love. 
Konoka had imagined many times and many ways in which her Secchan might 
react to the truth of Konoka's feelings for her, but never had she 
imagined her stoic warrior crying like this.<br><br>
"Secchan, please talk to 
me." A trembling breath, after which Konoka's voice also carried 
the faintest trace of tears. "I-is it because... you don't want... 
this... the engagement... m-me?"<br><br>
"NO!" Setsuna pulled back 
enough to face Konoka, still fighting her tears. "No, never that Kono-chan... 
I love you, I love you so much, I... I, I don't have to words for 
how much." The dark eyes might have still been brimming with tears, 
but the honesty and depth of emotion blazed even in the faint light.<br>
<br>
"I-its just that I... I'm 
afraid, afraid of waking up and this, all of this, will just have been 
a dream." Setsuna whispered, unable to meet Konoka's eyes as she 
confessed her fears. "I don't know if I can survive that... even 
if it is just a dream, to have held you, to have had your love, and 
then... <i>not</i>, I..."<br><br>
She could say no more and just 
shook her head helplessly, the emotions too strong for the words she 
had to use to describe them with at the moment. The message had been 
conveyed anyway, and Konoka, gently wiping away Setsuna's tears with 
the sleeves of the jacket, understood.<br><br>
"This is not a dream, Secchan. 
This is real." A brief, tender kiss. "This is happening. I love 
you, you love me..." She wrapped her arms back around Setsuna's 
neck, a slightly shy but happy smile on her lips. "...through some 
stroke of luck, daddy and grandpa approves of us..."<br>
<br>
"And if you'll have me, 
in a few years I would very much like to marry you."<br>
<br>
It was Konoka's turn to blush 
and look away after that statement, looking back up only when Setsuna 
pulled her in to hug her more carefully. <br><br>
"Do you promise?" A soft 
meek whisper against Konoka's neck.<br><br>
"More than promise... I <i>
swear</i>."<br><br>
--- <br><br>
By the time Setsuna escorted 
Konoka back to her dorm-room it was late enough that of Konoka's two 
roommates one was already sleeping and the other was walking around 
in her pyjamas with a toothbrush in her mouth.<br><br>
"Hey, if it isn't the fancy 
date couple." Asuna grinned and waved her toothbrush at them. "Boy, 
Konoka, when you said ‘don't wait up' you weren't kidding."<br>
<br>
The couple by the door both 
looked somewhat bashful but refrained from commenting. Having really 
already said their goodbyes outside the door - knowing there would 
be little privacy to do so once the door was opened - Konoka merely 
handed over the jacket and the two shared a sweet little goodnight kiss.<br>
<br>
Asuna smirked as she watched 
them. "What, no repeat of last night? I've got pen and paper out, 
all ready to take notes."<br><br>
Setsuna fled, grateful to be 
able to do so, and Konoka turned from the door with a happy little sigh, 
giving Asuna's toothbrush a playful tap as she passed her by. "Ha 
ha. Go brush your teeth, funny girl."<br><br>
Asuna instead leaned closer, 
taking a close look at Konoka's somewhat messy hair. "What's this?" 
She plucked a few things from the brown strands. "What's with all 
the grass in your hair, Konoka?"<br><br>
Konoka went beet red.<br>
<br>
"...oh my god!" With a 
gasp the wide-eyed Asuna pointed at Konoka with her toothbrush, making 
Konoka back up a step to avoid the slightly foamy little thing that 
was being waved about. "You didn't! And on the ground!"<br>
<br>
Well, there had been ground 
involved, Konoka reflected, just not perhaps quite in the way Asuna 
was imagining. Or at least not entirely.<br><br>
Konoka and Setsuna had embraced 
for a long time, settling Setsuna's insecurities and upset feelings. 
When they finally let go of each other Setsuna had timidly suggested 
that they should start heading back. They had only managed to walk a 
few steps when Konoka had stopped and impulsively blurted to the girl 
a few steps in front of her "Say it again, Secchan!"<br>
<br>
Setsuna had turned around and 
blinked owlishly, apparently not quite following.<br>
<br>
"I love you!" Konoka's 
declaration was spoken with a strong voice, a hushed voice would not 
do for the powerful need in her heart right then. "I love you Secchan!"<br>
<br>
Setsuna had blushed and smiled. 
"I love you too, Kono-chan."<br><br>
Unable to hold back Konoka 
had jumped at Setsuna in a flying tackle, one that whether due to the 
fact that Setsuna was unprepared or because the grass was slippery, 
had them falling down, kissing.<br><br>
Konoka had wanted this moment 
for so very long, a moment when her Secchan loved her back and wasn't 
afraid to say or show it, that she had no thought of restraint. Setsuna's 
reasons were very much similar, and with no-one there to interrupt them... 
neither of them knew how long they rolled around in the grass, kissing 
deeply, touching heatedly and crossing quite a few boundaries before 
they came back to their senses. It had been nothing short of amazing.<br>
<br>
Still, Konoka thought as she 
watched her roommate draw her own conclusions about events, it was probably 
not quite what Asuna thought they had done.<br><br>
"I'm sure I have no idea 
what you're talking about Asuna. Go finish brushing your teeth already." 
She tried to turn from her far too inquisitive friend as she began changing 
out of her dress.<br><br>
"Ooo! Is that a hickey?"<br>
<br>
<i>Oh boy.</i><br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
The next day the unfortunately 
not-so-well hidden hickeys caused quite the pandemonium as a few of 
Konoka and Setsuna's classmates spotted them and had no compunctions 
about interrogating the two or speculating out loud on their own. A 
few accidentally blurted remarks from Negi added to the buzz, and by 
midday the entire class were well aware that Setsuna and Konoka were 
dating and supposed to get engaged. Even in class the two were to some 
degree the recipients of much joking and teasing for a while, but after 
a particular event involving Asuna and, of all people, Mana, that had 
the class rep getting rather upset and putting her foot firmly down 
on any further misconduct, things calmed down somewhat. <br>
<br>
There were of course still 
the occasional uproar, like the particular morning when Negi read his 
students full names for the attendance list, and when he came to student 
number fifteen he cleared his throat and pronounced with a bit of extra 
care the name "Konoe Setsuna."<br><br>
When the blushing young warrior 
replied to the name, the class of course erupted in various comments 
and questions for some time, especially from the class paparazzi whom 
was working on a school newspaper article about the school's suddenly 
quite popular ‘princess and knight protector' couple. Setsuna groaned 
over her new-won fame but found it all in all to be a terribly small 
price to pay for having Konoka by her side.<br><br>
Besides these occasional bursts 
of embarrassing activity and interest things were calm, or at least 
as calm as they ever were in Mahora. A few other chaotic events that 
were unrelated to Setsuna and Konoka took place, but there was nothing 
that interfered with the pair's continued dating.<br>
<br>
They went to the movies, and 
they went shopping. They went for a boat ride, and for a picnic in the 
park. They went for another, less fancy, dinner date, and they had one 
date at an amusement park. Everything went very well in that department, 
very well indeed.<br><br>
So well in fact that Setsuna, 
nervous and jittery, found herself taking a secret trip into town to 
scour a certain type of shop for that perfect thing. It proved to be 
much harder to choose a specific one than Setsuna had ever thought it 
would be, although to be fair she had not spent much time considering 
such things before she found herself in a relationship with her precious 
Kono-chan.<br><br>
Next on her agenda was something 
somewhat overdue that she had completely forgotten about until just 
that day.<br><br>
So it was that Setsuna found 
herself outside of principal Konoe's office, taking a moment to use 
a few breathing techniques to keep herself from breaking out in an uncalled 
for but still impending terrified sweat. She fell back on every ounce 
of martial arts discipline she knew to keep her features and movements 
calm when she felt anything but, and knocked firmly on the door.<br>
<br>
Setsuna's elderly employer 
had been surprised to see her without a scheduled patrol-related meeting, 
but he had been friendly and welcoming, spending a few moments on pleasantries 
with the girl he had chosen for his granddaughter. Finally though Konoemon 
gently urged the tense warrior to state her purpose.<br>
<br>
"Sir, I have come to ask 
for your permission to p-propose to Konoka-ojousama." Setsuna bowed 
at the waist, as deeply as she could, and waited.<br>
<br>
The old man blinked and scratched 
his beard. "Setsuna-kun? Is my memory deceiving me when I recall you 
being present for the omiai which my son-in-law and I arranged to have 
you children properly engaged?"<br><br>
"N-no sir, I was indeed present." 
Slightly unsure whether or not she was meant to answer the question 
Setsuna still did, fearing to seem impolite, and straightened hesitantly 
to be able to look at her intended's grandfather for what she had 
to say. "It is just that I wanted to personally ask for your approval 
before approaching Konoka-ojousama."<br><br>
Quietly, with some hesitation. 
"You know what I am, sir."<br><br>
Konoemon slowly made his way 
around the desk, speaking as he walked. "Indeed I know who and what 
you are, Setsuna-kun. You are a fine young individual of many good qualities 
that I have looked for in a mate for my only grandchild, and as for 
your... additional abilities, I have come to the conclusion that they 
will only benefit coming generations of the Konoe line."<br>
<br>
Setsuna's eyes went wide 
as saucers as she began to grasp what the principal was saying. "F-future 
line... ?"<br><br>
"Children, Setsuna-kun!" 
A gnarled hand came to rest on Setsuna's shoulder. "I wish to see 
happy, healthy great-grandchildren in due time. And your children are 
likely to inherit your wings, are they not?"<br><br>
Never ever had Setsuna even 
in passing had a thought of children in regards to herself, and certainly 
not in the context of <i>having them</i> with Kono-chan. Although she 
knew well that Kono-chan was required to give birth to an heir, what 
that meant when Kono-chan was set to marry <i>her</i> had somehow passed 
by completely unnoticed.<br><br>
Setsuna blushed a furious red.<br>
<br>
"There there Setsuna-kun." 
Konoemon patted her shoulder and grinned. "You will have years yet 
before you need to work on my great-grandchildren." A pause. "In 
fact, I am counting on there being no need to worry about any surprise 
appearances of great-grandchildren before the wedding, that is one of 
the reasons I do not mind allowing you and my granddaughter to live 
together for the remainder of your time at this school."<br>
<br>
Seeing that his words were 
not exactly helping the violently blushing girl, Konoemon tried to steer 
the conversation away from potentially sensitive areas. "So, Setsuna-kun, 
since you have come to ask for my blessing I assume you have prepared 
a proposal to Konoka. When do you intend to ask her?"<br>
<br>
The girl in front of him almost 
visibly shook herself back to attention. "I haven't planned in any 
detail, but I hope to ask tonight, sir."<br><br>
"Make sure you two drop by 
when you get back, I would like to see my grandchild's happy face 
after you have proposed."<br><br>
"Yes sir!" Setsuna bowed 
deeply again. "By your leave, sir."<br><br>
"One moment, Setsuna-kun." 
Konoemon put a hand on her head in a strangely affectionate gesture. 
"I'll ask you to remember that you are a Konoe now, Setsuna-kun. 
It is an old and respectable name, and you should not be so quick to 
bow so deeply now that you wear it. I would like to see you hold your 
head high, like the honourable person you are."<br>
<br>
"At least there is no reason 
to bow so deeply for your future grandfather." He smiled kindly at 
the surprised girl. "Now go, and remember I'll be expecting you 
later tonight."<br><br>
Setsuna sketched a more brief 
but still polite bow and scrambled for the door.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
It wasn't that the date they 
had planned that particular day was specifically special, or rather, 
that it was any more special than any of the ones leading up to it. 
It wasn't that the day in question had a specific meaning, no anniversary 
of their meeting or particular number of days that they had been dating, 
nothing like that as far as Setsuna knew. It also wasn't as if she 
had planned a special thing, an event or a speech or a particular approach... 
Setsuna just knew that it was time.<br><br>
Her heart demanded that she 
would show Kono-chan her love and commitment, offer herself and whatever 
there might be in her future to her beloved one in the most sincere 
way she could think of.<br><br>
Yes, technically they had already 
agreed to get engaged, and most likely the principal would make it official 
any day now, now that Setsuna's name had been changed as promised. 
But Setsuna still wanted to ask Konoka on her own, so that for both 
their sakes they would know that their engagement was out of love.<br>
<br>
Normally, Setsuna felt sure, 
people would probably be nervous when they intended to propose to their 
girlfriend. That wasn't quite the case with Setsuna, she had been 
more nervous speaking to the principal - and Master Eishun whom she 
had called on the phone after leaving the principal's office - than 
she was about meeting Kono-chan. Certainly, there was some anxiety regarding 
whether or not Setsuna would manage to word things right and not make 
a spectacle out of herself, but she had at least been blissfully spared 
the worry that Kono-chan might not say yes.<br><br>
Kono-chan had after all already <i>
said</i> yes, repeatedly and in many ways.<br><br>
As things turned out it was 
a good thing that Setsuna had made no specific romantic plans for her 
proposal, as the date in question ended up being hijacked by a group 
of their friends, led by Haruna and an apologetic Asuna, turning the 
supposed date into a playful group outing by the beach. It did not matter 
so much to Setsuna as Konoka was having a good time, however she did 
need some time alone with her girlfriend. Taking her chance as the others 
divided up for some ballgame Setsuna quickly grabbed Konoka by the hand 
and asked her to come with her for a walk.<br><br>
She led the smiling Konoka 
away from the beach and the curious gazes of their friends, until she 
found a secluded little patch of grass behind some trees and bushes 
where they had a shot at some privacy. As soon as they stopped Konoka 
grinned mischievously, put her arms around Setsuna, pulled her close 
and proceeded to kiss her in a way very much not suitable for an audience.<br>
<br>
The brunette frowned when far 
too soon her Secchan disentangled herself from the passionate embrace 
and took a step back. When Secchan then took another step back as Konoka 
reached forward to rectify the situation, the frown got company by a 
cute pout.<br><br>
"Secchan, what's wrong?" <i>
Something</i> had to be wrong, because Secchan did not refuse Konoka's 
kisses for no reason.<br><br>
Setsuna cleared her throat 
and fiddled around in an inside pocket of her jacket before finding 
what she was searching for, taking a moment to get the surprisingly 
resisting lid on the small black box to open, and then she went down 
on bended knee so fast that she accidentally ended up on both knees 
instead of one. Quickly realizing her mistake Setsuna shot up again 
and did over, winding up on one knee this time.<br><br>
Taking a moment to check herself 
and nodding in satisfaction at the pose, although the thought did occur 
to her that she did not know if one particular knee was the custom or 
not, Setsuna then looked up to face the stunned Konoka and thrust the 
open box towards her on arms as straight and rigid as rulers.<br>
<br>
"Kono-chan!" The girl in 
question jumped slightly at the somewhat loud exclamation of her name.<br>
<br>
"I love you. You are my life, 
my reason, and my purpose." Setsuna gentled her voice a little. "I 
am not worthy of you, but if you will have me I will spend the rest 
of my life trying my best to make you happy."<br><br>
<i>Oh this proposal thing was 
a snap after all</i>, Setsuna thought somewhat relieved that the words 
had come to her. With renewed determination she bounced the small box 
a little higher towards her Kono-chan who was by now holding both hands 
to her mouth.<br><br>
"Kono-chan, will you ma-HAAaaaAA...!"<br>
<br>
Only Setsuna's quick reflexes 
saved her from getting the falling branch on her head, but try though 
she did she was not quite as able to avoid going down in a tangle of 
arms and legs as the limb suddenly falling out of the tree above also 
brought with it the twins and Makie.<br><br>
"Darnit, now see what you 
did!" Asuna said angrily at the accidental troublemakers, stepping 
out from one of the bushes surrounding the glen. Reluctantly and in 
some cases sheepishly others, like Haruna and Kazumi, stepped out of 
the bushes as well.<br><br>
"Guys, I can explain what 
we're doing here..." Asuna began, looking and sounding very apologetic, 
but neither of the two she was addressing was paying her the slightest 
attention.<br><br>
Setsuna crawled out from the 
human heap and began a frantic search on all fours. "The ring! The 
ring! Where did it go?"<br><br>
Her search was ended by a warm 
voice calling for her attention. "Secchan... Secchan, come here." 
The ring had jumped out of the box almost straight at Konoka when the 
box flew out of Setsuna's hand, and so the happily smiling, almost <i>
glowing</i>, girl stood holding the ring out for her girlfriend to take.<br>
<br>
Holding out her hand, and specifically 
her finger, when her Secchan took back the ring Konoka swallowed hard, 
then almost whispered her answer, voice filled with emotion. "Yes. 
Yes I will, my Secchan."<br><br>
The ring was quickly placed 
on the waiting finger by a widely grinning Setsuna, then they were in 
each others arms, lips coming together...<br><br>
"HOLD IT!" Asuna called 
them back to their surroundings. "Sorry guys, but this is why I'm 
here." She fished out a small box from her own pocket and tossed it 
at Konoka, who caught it surprisingly deftly with one hand. "The principal 
told me to tag along with you guys today even if I had to be sneaky 
about it, so that I could give that to Konoka without ruining Setsuna's 
surprise." She put a hand behind her head and looked sheepish. "The 
others weren't part of the plan, sorry."<br><br>
Konoka opened the box, finding 
a small note from her grandfather as well as a ring. Handing the box 
back to Asuna she said softly "Thank you Asuna." She looked at the 
ring and added. "Thank you grandpa."<br><br>
Then, beaming happily, Konoka 
put the somewhat more plain ring than the one she herself wore on Setsuna's 
hand, and sealed the promise with a kiss. This time the kiss was long 
and deep and enthusiastic, and their company, despite cheering and whistling 
and even clapping, did nothing to stop them.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
Konoka and Setsuna did not 
remain with their friends for long after the somewhat tumultuous proposal, 
instead they made their way back to the school to go see Konoka's 
grandfather before intending to sneak off to a place where they could 
be alone, namely Setsuna's room.<br><br>
It took a good long while, 
visiting Konoemon, as the old man was full of well-wishes, sentimental 
memories, and just generally unusually chatty. They did not mind, of 
course, and both made sure to thank him for his thoughtfulness in providing 
a ring for Setsuna, but they did have an itching to be alone.<br>
<br>
Finally they managed to say 
their goodbyes to Konoemon and set out for the dorms, but once there 
Konoka and Setsuna were met with a surprise. With Konoka clinging amorously 
to her neck Setsuna blindly opened the door and they stumbled inside, 
already kissing.<br><br>
Then a throat cleared none-too-discreetly 
and an amused voice spoke up "Did you lose your way?"<br>
<br>
Jumping apart, startled, Konoka 
and Setsuna stared uncomprehendingly at Haruna, whom apparently was 
just changing out of the clothes she had been wearing when they saw 
her last.<br>
"What... what are you..." 
Setsuna blinked. "Did I get the wrong door?"<br><br>
Haruna chuckled. "Don't 
tell me that with all the sneaking around going on today, nobody thought 
to tell you two that you've had your rooms reassigned?"<br>
<br>
"Reassigned?" Konoka echoed 
with some interest.<br><br>
"Yeah, the two of you got 
the dorm room Yue, Nodoka and I used to have, I got yours" a grin 
and a victory sign directed at Setsuna "and Yue and Nodoka got a double 
a bit further down the hall from our old room."<br>
<br>
She continued unconcerned with 
the dumbfounded expressions she was facing. "Apparently Eva-san spent 
most part of the afternoon overseeing the moving personally, though 
Chachamaru, Kaede and a group of others were involved too."<br>
<br>
"Eva..."<br>
<br>
"...-san?"<br>
<br>
Setsuna and Konoka exchanged 
a look, then they bolted for the door. Belatedly a "Thanks Paru!" 
drifted back to the open door as the bespectacled girl went to close 
it.<br><br>
"Honestly, kids today. Hmm... 
where did I put the box with the rest of my drawing equipment, anyway?"<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
Racing down the corridors Konoka 
and Setsuna travelled the distance from Setsuna's old room to the 
room next to Konoka's old one in something akin to record time. Konoka 
was giggling slightly, excited by the prospect but not knowing just 
what to expect, while Setsuna... Setsuna was chanting in her mind all 
the way there.<br><br>
<i>Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi 
Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi 
Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi Yuunagi...</i><br>
<br>
 Once there she flung the door 
open and shouted "YUUNAGI!"<br><br>
"Oh?" Konoka looked at 
her fiancée curiously. "Can it answer you?"<br><br>
Setsuna blushed instantly and, 
in a belated move to not appear quite so desperate to find her precious 
sword, stepped aside to let Konoka enter the room while Setsuna closed 
the door.<br><br>
Inching slightly sideways Setsuna 
tried not to be terribly obvious as she scanned to room for any sign 
of her prized weapon, not much caring if anything else in her possession 
was there or not. In truth Yuunagi was the only item Setsuna owned that 
had value and meaning, the rest of her Spartan belongings - or Spartan 
until Evangeline had gotten hold of her wardrobe, anyway - Setsuna 
could have or lose should it come to that. All other things she cherished 
were of the kind that could not be put in material objects, like the 
memories in her mind, the feelings in her heart, and the people that 
meant something to her, specifically her beloved Kono-chan.<br>
<br>
<i>Although...</i> Setsuna 
glanced at her finger where the ring rested with an unfamiliar but not 
unpleasant feeling. <i>That was not true anymore, that Yuunagi was the 
only thing she owned that she cherished beyond description.</i> She 
touched the ring and smiled in wonder.<br><br>
Looking up from her admiring 
of the silver band Setsuna spotted her sword at last, securely placed 
on a stand in a small and elegantly decorated fake alcove at the back 
of the room together with other weapons or work-related items in Setsuna's 
possession. Hurriedly Setsuna drew the sword to inspect that no damage 
had befallen the blade in her absence, and only once satisfied that 
Yuunagi was safe did she take a moment to admire the elegantly written 
scroll on the wall and the potted bamboo arrangement below it.<br>
<br>
There was a note on top of 
her calligraphy box that turned out to be from Nagase Kaede. ‘<i>Begging 
your pardon for the rudeness, this one has handled your weapons with 
outmost care de gozaru. /Kaede'</i> it said, making Setsuna smile 
a little over her classmate and new fighting companion's way of phrasing 
herself even in writing, and she felt somewhat relieved. The ninja was 
one of those people that could be trusted to understand the importance 
of a weapon and treat it accordingly, so Setsuna felt no need to examine 
the rest of her equipment.<br><br>
"Secchan, we need to go shopping." 
Konoka walked out of the kitchen, her first point of inspection, tapping 
a finger to her chin. "Asuna has kept my cooking equipment, so I'll 
need to buy a new set." Already she was running a list of things in 
her mind that she would need.<br><br>
For some reason while they 
both moved towards the other, Konoka and Setsuna discovered the bed 
at the same moment.<br><br>
"Oh." Konoka said softly, 
her hand moving up to a slightly pinkish cheek.<br><br>
Setsuna on the other hand turned 
an instant glowing red. "T-t-t-there has been some mistake, surely."<br>
<br>
Instead of the expected two-level 
bunk bed that was the standard for the shared rooms of the dorm there 
was a large, dark-wood four-poster bed tucked into the recessed section 
of the wall otherwise intended for a bunk bed. It was not ornate, but 
it was large and luxurious compared to the standard beds, and... it 
was also the <i>only</i> bed in the room.<br><br>
A red ribbon was tied to one 
of the posts, attached to a small card. Konoka walked over and read 
it, untying the ribbon in the process, then offered it to Setsuna whom 
seemed almost frightened to look at it.<br><br>
The card simply said ‘<i>Enjoy!</i>' 
and had in lieu of a name a small drawing of a grinning chibified Evangeline 
with fangs.<br><br>
Setsuna found her voice with 
a start. "IamdreadfullysorryKono<WBR>-chanIamsureitisjustamistakeorp<WBR>ossiblyajokefromEvangeline<WBR>-sanIwillgotalktotheprincipalan<WBR>dgetthingsstraightenedout..."<br>
<br>
"Ee? You don't want to 
share a bed with me, Secchan?" The disappointment was clear in Konoka's 
voice. She continued in a slightly sad, quieter voice. "And I was 
so looking forward to being able to sleep holding you or being held 
by you tonight, too."<br><br>
Speechless Setsuna stared at 
her beloved as Konoka daintily sat on the edge of the bed, running a 
hand across the bedspread and not meeting Setsuna's eyes. How could 
she even consider refusing any request made by her Kono-chan? With visions 
of a future that held an inhumanly large amount of ice-cold baths running 
through her head, Setsuna walked over to the edge of the bed and crouched 
down in front of Konoka, her hands on Konoka's knees.<br>
<br>
"If that is what you want, 
Kono-chan, then I have no reason to protest it. But are you sure?"<br>
<br>
Konoka smiled and put her hands 
on Setsuna's face. "We love each other and we will get married. 
Sooner or later we are going to share a bed, Secchan, and for the rest 
of our lives too. Yes of course I'm sure." Her expression changed 
to something peculiarly mischievous. "And sooner or later we are going 
to use it for what <i>you</i> were thinking of too, my Secchan."<br>
<br>
Setsuna jerked upright, blushing 
if possible even more than before while gesturing and stuttering desperately. 
"W-w-w-w-what? Kono-chan, I-I-I..."<br><br>
Laughing softly Konoka caught 
the flailing hands, knelt on the bed to give a small and silencing kiss. 
"Relax Secchan, I was only teasing you.... well, maybe not <i>only </i>
teasing, but anyway, take it easy. Why don't you come here and we 
can lie down for a bit." Her words were followed by a gentle tug on 
Setsuna's hands as Konoka moved further in on the bed.<br>
<br>
Still reeling somewhat and 
frankly feeling just a bit worn out, Setsuna acquiesced without further 
protests, and lay down next to Konoka. Konoka immediately wrapped herself 
comfortably around her warrior with her head on Setsuna's shoulder, 
sighing contently as Setsuna's arms hesitantly came up to circle her. 
They lay in silence for a long time.<br><br>
"Remember when we used to 
sleep together as children?" Konoka asked softly, the peace of just 
holding each other slowly settling both girls into a state of semi-dozing.<br>
<br>
Setsuna yawned and squeezed 
Konoka a little tighter. "We never slept like this though."<br>
<br>
A soft giggle. "Not while 
you were aware of it, no."<br><br>
An eye cracked open to peer 
down at Konoka affectionately. "Is that so? What else did you do to 
me while I was defenceless and sleeping?"<br><br>
"Oh, nothing..." A soft 
kiss to Setsuna's shoulder. "I wasn't old enough to want to do 
more than squeeze the stuffing out of you back then, after all."<br>
<br>
The body underneath Konoka's 
shook gently with an amused laugh. "I did tell you that I have loved 
you since we were children, didn't I?" Konoka continued, drawing 
feather-light little patterns on Secchan's chest with one hand.<br>
<br>
Clutching Konoka a little tighter 
Setsuna blinked against a sudden moisture in her eyes. "I remember 
how the day we met I had been told that I might get to see the young 
ojousama if I was lucky, and I had secretly been hoping that I would." 
Setsuna smiled at the memory. "The first time you smiled at me... 
I think that was when it happened."<br><br>
Konoka pushed up on one arm 
just enough to look Setsuna in the eye. "When what happened?"<br>
<br>
"When you claimed my heart." 
Setsuna answered immediately and without a trace of hesitation.<br>
<br>
With a delighted squeal Konoka 
caught Setsuna in a kiss, previous drowsiness forgotten, putting her 
all into it. Moaning Setsuna rolled them over, and soon, being happy, 
in love and alone, things got very heated between them.<br>
<br>
Konoka's legs were locked 
around Setsuna and her hands had yanked Setsuna's shirt out of her 
pants and made an opening through which they were occupied with exploring 
the skin on Setsuna's back. Setsuna on the other hand was dimly aware 
that one hand was squeezing something round and rather soft where it 
lay, pinned underneath their bodies, while hungrily devouring Konoka's 
tongue.<br><br>
That was when the door flung 
open with a thud and a loud voice calling out "Pardon the intrusion!" 
followed by a number of voices calling out even louder "SURPRISE!" 
and the lights turning on and the sound of a group of people moving 
quickly into the room.<br><br>
Setsuna and Konoka froze.<br>
<br>
"Oh... my... god." Asuna 
groaned, beet red as was the larger part of the party group behind her 
when they spotted the entangled couple on the noticeably single bed, 
with the exception of Kazumi who was already taking pictures with a 
delighted gleam in her eyes. "We, err, thought we'd throw you a 
room-warming and engagement-celebration party..." <br>
<br>
The equally embarrassed couple 
raced to disentangle themselves and straighten out clothing that had 
ended up askew, before Konoka turned to their sudden guests with a perfect 
smile and a graceful gesture to come further into the room. "Please, 
come on in then... I'm afraid we don't have anything at all in the 
refrigerator yet, so we can't really offer you anything to eat or 
drink."<br><br>
"Oh that's ok, we brought 
everything with us!" Asuna was ridiculously relieved that Konoka decided 
to act as if the group had not walked in on anything, and she was more 
than happy to do the same. "Right guys?"<br><br>
Belting out a rather shaky 
cry of confirmation the rest of the group hurried in with various foods 
and drinks, arranging the table until it was overflowing and setting 
an assortment of games around the room as well. Someone brought a heap 
of sitting pillows as well, and soon enough Setsuna and Konoka was sitting 
side by side among their friends, some undefined drink in their hands 
while waiting for a slice of chocolate cake.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
In a cottage some distance 
away a diminutive blonde was leisurely sipping the tea made by her robotic 
companion, a small smirk lurking at the edge of her lips.<br>
<br>
"You are very kind, Master." 
Chachamaru observed in her ever calm and mild voice.<br>
<br>
Evangeline snorted and looked 
away. "Nah, don't be fooled... I only did this because I was bored... 
and because it might come in handy to have the future leaders of the 
Kansai and Kantou Magic Associations, not to mention the old goat, be 
indebted to me." She took a sip of her tea. "Nothing else."<br>
<br>
"I see, Master."<br>
<br>
"What! What do you see? What!" 
The suddenly flustered Evangeline began waving her arms in front of 
her servant, scowling. "I haven't <i>told</i> you to see anything!"<br>
<br>
"Acknowledged, Master." 
Only one who was very familiar with the automated young woman could 
have spotted the ghost of a smile on her placid countenance at her master's 
ranting. <br><br>
