<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Chisame Hasegawa scowled as the redhead stomped towards her room, her 
round glasses gleaming. Normally she would have been eagerly going home, 
plotting the further activities of her online persona Chiu, but lately 
she had been feeling strangely dissatisfied with it all.

&#39;It was that damn pactio,&#39; Chisame silently admitted to herself as she 
walked towards her personal computer.

In the middle of the conflict with Chao she had formed a contract with 
Negi, getting a magical artifact that assisted her in fighting the war 
in cyberspace. Using the modified baton Chisame could travel into 
cyberspace in her Chiu persona, even bringing others in with her, and 
there she could program with incredible speed and skill.

&quot;Of course, that&#39;s the problem now,&quot; Chisame murmured as she sat in 
front of the keyboard, not even changing to her Chiu guise. Since 
gaining her artifact she had become so good it wasn&#39;t a challenge to 
manipulate the web, in fact her site was the most popular one among all 
net idols. Literally, there was nothing left for her to do.

The sound of knocking on her door made Chisame frown even more fiercely 
as she got up. &quot;What?&quot; she demanded as she flung open the door, only to 
freeze.

The young woman standing there in the hall looked familiar, but oddly 
different as well. Short green hair fell down to her shoulders, and odd, 
rounded metallic ears stuck out from each side of her head as she 
struggled with a slightly overlarge dress, her blue eyes as open and 
innocent looking as ever.

&quot;Chachamaru?&quot; Chisame blinked.

&quot;Chisame,&quot; Chachamaru nodded, &quot;I was hoping to find you here. I need 
your assistance with something.&quot;

&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Chisame asked as she waved her friend inside. Of 
course, she would never admit to considering her a friend, but the 
android girl had surprisingly become quite close to her.

Chachamaru followed her in, smiling slightly, &quot;Mistress Hakase is 
upgrading my usual body, so she put my core programs into this one.&quot; She 
tugged at her oversized clothes, &quot;However, she forgot to prepare 
clothing for me.&quot;

&quot;I should have something in my cosplay gear that will fit you,&quot; Chisame 
said while trying to hide her amusement at how cute the new Chachamaru 
looked, almost like a child wearing her parent&#39;s clothes.

&quot;Exactly why I came here,&quot; Chachamaru agreed.

Swinging her closet open Chisame was faintly surprised at how nice it 
felt, having Chachamaru needing her help. &quot;What sort of clothes would 
you like?&quot; she asked, turning with several variations on school girl 
uniforms in her hands only to freeze in surprise.

Chachamaru calmly finished stripping, revealing a body far less doll 
like than her old one. &quot;A uniform would be fine,&quot; she said calmly.

&quot;Right,&quot; Chisame managed, gulping. &quot;You&#39;re new body,&quot; she said as she 
picked out a uniform that would be roughly Chachamaru&#39;s new size, &quot;it&#39;s 
much more human looking than your old one.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Chachamaru agreed as she took the clothes from her, &quot;Mistress 
Hakase even designed my new body for sex.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Chisame gazed at Chachamaru in surprise.

Chachamaru calmly got dressed as she said, &quot;Apparently, Mistress feels I 
should be prepared, assuming my relationship with Negi progresses far 
enough.&quot;

Chisame rolled her eyes, &quot;Would all of you idiots get it through your 
heads he&#39;s a ten year old?!&quot; She waved her hands, &quot;There are far more 
appropriate people to be fixating on!&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Chachamaru dressed with simple grace, only having a bit of 
trouble with her newly redesigned ear-antenna.

&quot;Here,&quot; Chisame helped her, getting the shirt over the ear-antenna with 
a certain amount of care, &quot;is that better?&quot;

&quot;Much, thank you,&quot; Chachamaru bowed slightly.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Chisame smiled slightly.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Chachamaru asked curiously, looking around 
Chisame&#39;s room.

With a bit of embarrassment Chisame admitted, &quot;I was going to work on my 
site for awhile, but I don&#39;t really feel like it.&quot;

&quot;I understand Mistress Evangeline is having a informal meeting with 
Negi-sensei and his comrades,&quot; Chachamaru noted, &quot;why don&#39;t you come?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, I don&#39;t want to hang out with those crazies!&quot; Chisame protested.

Chachamaru blushed faintly, &quot;Chisame, this will be the first time 
they&#39;ll see my new body.&quot; She hesitated as she confessed, &quot;I&#39;m nervous.&quot;

&quot;No one would say anything,&quot; Chisame reassured her.

&quot;Maybe, but...&quot; Chachamaru shrugged, &quot;could you please come along?&quot;

Chisame scratched the back of her head and sighed. &quot;All right,&quot; she gave 
in, &quot;I&#39;ll go.&quot;

Chachamaru took her hands and smiled, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Evangeline&#39;s resort made Chisame&#39;s head hurt, honestly. In the basement 
of Evangeline&#39;s home, it looked like a model of a tower in a glass 
globe, but if you stood in the right place you were transported inside. 
Within the tower, it was always summer and sunny, with much more room 
inside than one would have expected. Even better, time ran differently 
within the resort, so that when a hour passed in the real world, a day 
passed inside it.

Making things even crazier, Evangeline had recently expanded it to six 
globes, the original resort and five new enviroments, interconnected. A 
castle, jungle, arctic and desert world, each reachable via warp gates 
in each globe. It completely defied the laws of physics and common 
sense, all of which made Chisane&#39;s head pound.

Thankfully, the arrival of Chachamaru to the party went well, with Negi 
exclaiming how cute she was and the others following up. Ku Fei seemed 
complimented by the similarity in their looks, Nodoka and Yue said she 
was adorable and Kotaru seemed impressed by how tough she was. 
Evangeline herself nodded approvingly before adding, &quot;It&#39;s not bad, but 
I can&#39;t wait till the old you is back.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t that upset you?&quot; Chisame asked later, the two sitting at tables 
in the outdoor caf&eacute; in Evangeline&#39;s castle. Below them a waterfall 
rumbled softly, liquid falling endlessly to the bottom of the globe.

&quot;No,&quot; Chachamaru shook her head, &quot;Evangeline merely prefers I look the 
same.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;I think she is comforted, being a 
immortal and having someone mostly unchanging like me around.&quot;

&quot;Hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; Chisame admitted. &quot;You&#39;re pretty perceptive, 
dealing with Evangeline and the rest of us.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Chachamaru asked.

&quot;You certainly pegged me quickly for being intrigued by magic and our 
teacher, Negi,&quot; Chisame admitted as she stirred then drank from her cup 
of tea. &#39;How can there be birds flying by if this is a closed 
enviroment?&#39; she wondered as she watched them soar by, &#39;There&#39;s nowhere 
for them to fly to.&#39;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you would have joined us after the martial arts 
tournament if you hadn&#39;t been interested,&quot; Chachamaru noted.

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Chisame looked away, blushing.

While watching the martial arts tournament Chisame had found herself 
shocked again and again by the special skills and abilities that the 
fighters had displayed. Not just Negi, but ninjas, shadow users and 
others had appeared, each one making her lose her faith in the ordinary. 
That, along with the spreading virus of magic on the internet lead 
Chisame to begin to believe in magic, along with a few conversations 
with Chachamaru.

Chisame sweatdropped a bit, &quot;Thank you for being so patient with me in 
this.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been my pleasure,&quot; Chachamaru answered calmly. She paused, &quot;It&#39;s 
been nice, making a new friend.&quot;

&#39;Friends, she sees it too?&#39; Chisame sighed mentally, &#39;I guess I&#39;m just 
going to have to accept it.&#39; Aloud she said, &quot;It&#39;s been interesting, I 
have to confess.&quot;

&quot;How is it, dealing with Ayaka and Makie?&quot; Chachamaru asked, a spark of 
amusement in her eyes.

Chisame groaned as Chachamaru actually chuckled. The two ladies had been 
assisted by Chisame in the costume contest, then later had helped Chiu 
battled in cyberspace and as a side effect both girls had become 
determined to bring Chisame out of her shell, so to speak. To say it was 
aggravating was a understatement.

&quot;I&#39;m hoping if I ignore them they&#39;ll just go away,&quot; Chisame sighed.

Chachamaru looked sympathetic, &quot;I could try to put them off you, 
somehow. I know when rumors about Mistress Evangeline and I circulated, 
people left us alone.&quot;

&quot;Rumors about you two...&quot; Chisame blinked, then flushed as she realized 
what she meant. &quot;Well, if you were calling her mistress in class, I can 
see why people were nervous.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t understand the connotations till later,&quot; Chachamaru admitted 
wryly.

&#39;She&#39;s so innocent at times,&#39; Chisame mused, &#39;yet worldly too. It was 
charming, in a odd sort of way.&#39; She paused a moment, &#39;What am I 
thinking, charming?&#39;

&quot;Would you like something to drink?&quot; one of the Chacha robot pototypes 
asked, carrying a tray with various beverages.

&quot;More tea, please,&quot; Chachamaru smiled.

&quot;And some cookies too,&quot; Chisame added. She looked over at Chachamaru, 
watching the graceful girl who sat across from her. Most people, she 
wouldn&#39;t willingly spend ten minutes chatting with, but Chachamaru 
seemed to easily charm her. &#39;Wish I understood why she liked to be 
around me, too,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Because you&#39;re not afraid of me,&quot; Chachamaru answered honestly.

&quot;I said that last bit aloud?&quot; Chisame blinked.

&quot;Afraid so,&quot; Chachamaru gave her a gentle smile.

Chisame reached out to put her hand over Chachamaru&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re one of 
the kindest people I know,&quot; she said.

Chachamaru was a bit surprised by the gesture but smiled. &quot;I&#39;m also the 
one a third of the class saw beat Negi severely,&quot; she noted, &quot;and word 
got around. That&#39;s not the sort of thing people forget.&quot;

&quot;Then they&#39;re fools,&quot; Chisame said fiercely.

&quot;Thank you, Chisame,&quot; Chachamaru smiled brightly.

Once again, Chisame felt a uncomfortable stirring in her chest. &#39;Yeah, 
there&#39;s more appropriate people than a ten year old to be focusing on,&#39; 
she silently mused, &#39;and it looks like I&#39;ve found one.&#39;

End...?

Notes: Chachamaru and Chisame have a very interesting character arc in 
the Negima manga, becoming near friends then adversaries in the whole 
Chao story line. I rather liked how Chisame enjoyed teasing Chachamaru, 
and the odd connection they forged.</pre>
