------------------------------<br>
<br>
Tatsumiya Mana was a loner, 
intimidating and mysterious to her peers, and generally not a woman 
that inspired much in the way of friendship. It hadn't always been 
so, of course, nor was this state of affairs entirely of her own choosing, 
but life had shaped the path intended for her and Mana knew it well.<br>
<br>
Consequently she made no effort 
of befriending anyone, nor did she try to be understood or at least 
found less frightening to those that truly had nothing to fear from 
her. These things were of little importance at the end of the day, when 
she racked up her mental tally of the money earned against the costs 
of keeping her ancestral shrine alive.<br><br>
People, or rather those that 
knew something of what was going on in Mahora and had heard of the work 
Mana did, mistakenly thought Mana to be a callous mercenary that loved 
only two things in life; money and her guns.<br><br>
While it was true that Mana 
had a surprisingly strong bond to her weapons of choice - not an uncommon 
development in her line of work, she had found - money actually had 
no importance on its own for her. Mana was the last of her family, and 
with everyone she had once loved gone, she had nothing but the shrine 
left to care for. And the shrine... was oh so costly, forcing Mana to 
do whatever work she could find just to keep banks and debt collectors 
from tearing the ancient holy ground apart.<br><br>
Fortunately for Mana she was 
more than just a pretty face... what she could do was a rare thing, 
and those that were in need of such assistance were usually willing 
to pay nicely for services rendered. Oh that did not meant that money 
came easily, not at all, until she had gained a steady employment with 
Konoe Konoemon luck had controlled her earnings, and sometimes lady 
luck just wasn't in a charitable mood.<br><br>
It was terribly convenient 
to work for principal Konoe, as not only was the pay nice enough and 
moderately steady, but she was close to home and her shrine duties, 
and left with much spare time to pursue whatever other odds and ends 
that might bring in a bit of extra yen.<br><br>
It was not really until her 
young and innocent classmates had looked at her with something akin 
to the fear they might have shown a wild animal that Mana realized that 
with all the pain, loss and struggling in her life, Mana herself had 
gone cold inside. It was not that she did not have emotions, it was 
just that she hid them so well that it was rare for something, other 
than the joy of a hefty sum of money or a new shiny gun, to move her.<br>
<br>
Then shortly after being employed 
by the principal, Mana was introduced to one Sakurazaki Setsuna. The 
shorter, slender swordswoman was stoic to a fault, much like Mana herself, 
but unlike Mana it was fairly clear that Setsuna felt things very strongly. 
Finding herself slightly intrigued by the girl that was technically 
speaking her immediate boss, since principal Konoe had made clear that 
Mana was first and foremost in Setsuna's employ for her work of guarding 
the Mahora area against mystical intruders, Mana was drawn to her.<br>
<br>
To begin with they were both 
outsiders, standing on the sidelines observing, keeping watch against 
the unknown, and strictly speaking not particularly interested in joining 
in the childish goings-on around them. Additionally, after having fought 
together for a while, a camaraderie grew between them, a particular 
understanding that only those who had to repeatedly put their lives 
in each other's hands could have, until Mana realized that somewhere 
along the line she had gotten... <i>a friend</i>.<br>
<br>
Mana watched in sympathetic 
fascination as it became clear to her what her new friend's ‘holy 
shrine' was... the ever-smiling young girl that Setsuna, and to a 
lesser degree Mana, was employed to protect above all. Konoe Konoka. 
Mana herself was not a stranger to love, despite her age, but thinking 
of that particular loss... the memories echoed empty, the emotions long 
since frozen in a place she could not reach.<br><br>
She did remember the pain she 
had felt though, and although she said nothing she hoped for a better 
ending for her friend.<br><br>
Having a friend, someone to 
relate to even if it was an odd relationship given both their natures, 
did serve to soften some of Mana's abrasive cold over time. Eventually 
other classmates saw her joking with Setsuna and just like that, the 
fear of Mana disappeared. There were still those that were intimidated 
by her, naturally, but there were others still, like the cheerful and 
open-minded children whom saw someone interesting in her. She grew to 
have a fondness for these innocent souls and enjoyed the moments they 
spent with her, a further softening of cold and supposedly impenetrable 
walls.<br><br>
Then Mana and Setsuna were 
placed in another class at the beginning of one school year, the same 
one as the young heiress that held Mana's sword-swinging friend's 
heart. She watched in silent sympathy as Setsuna tried so hard to keep 
her cool and keep her distance, even though young Konoka-ojousama clearly 
wanted nothing more than to be by Setsuna's side. She tried to suggest 
to her friend that perhaps a little closeness with the girl was not 
a bad thing, but found it a subject difficult to broach, much less something 
she felt she had any right to interfere in.<br><br>
Somehow as Mana's attention 
were on other things, Setsuna and Konoka-ojousama found their way back 
to one another. Mana watched in amusement as the two of them clung to 
one another like new lovers, and felt a great deal of gratitude on the 
behalf of her friend that their young ojousama had managed to lift the 
veil of stoic suffering from Setsuna, revealing the shy, pure and innocent 
girl she was underneath the warrior.<br><br>
Yes, Mana had watched Setsuna's 
love for Konoka-ojousama for some time, and even seen signs of the corresponding 
emotion in the heiress. Yet she had been completely unprepared for her 
own reaction the day she had, as so many times before, walked into Setsuna's 
room without preamble... only to find her friend and the ojousama in 
a clearly heated embrace on the floor, undressing one another.<br>
<br>
She was completely unprepared 
for the pang of jealousy that was part of her response to the discovery. 
Setsuna was a treasured friend, and one Mana would feel happy for now 
that things seemed to go her way at last, and Mana had never held any 
feelings for Setsuna beyond their friendship, yet... Yet, once Mana 
took a long hard look into her own reasons, she found that while there 
were no romantic feelings towards Setsuna there was a sense of belonging, 
a sense that while the two of them were doomed to live without such 
things as love, at least they would have each other to turn to. Setsuna 
had found love and happiness after all, and a part of Mana felt left 
behind, the only one remaining destined for a loveless, solitary life.<br>
<br>
<i>Alone</i>.<br>
<br>
Mana stomped hard on that unwanted 
spark of emotion, eradicating it before it could cause trouble with 
the only person she still truly considered a friend. She even managed 
a few words of encouragement and advice to Setsuna, though the subject 
was a difficult one and the statement costly, in terms of the images 
and awful hollowness they brought with them. Still, she hoped her friend 
would take her advice to heart, and not let her own low self-esteem 
get in the way of greater happiness.<br><br>
Another shock had been when 
Mana had found out that not only had her friend scored the little princess 
on high, apparently they were engaged to be married, approved of by 
the ruling kings themselves. This time it was thankfully just the shock 
of her friend's future taking off at rocket speed and not something 
troublesome in her own character.<br><br>
Setsuna's change in status 
from a warrior of the shadow like Mana herself to a prince in the making 
brought changes also to Mana's everyday life. While she met and spoke 
to Setsuna everyday and they still patrolled together, Setsuna's time 
in active combat and patrolling duty was being cut down, though Mana 
was unsure if Setsuna even knew this. It seemed a natural and reasonable 
thing to do, to lessen the likelihood of Konoka-ojousama's future 
wife dying while perimeter-keeping with the rest of the fighters, and 
had she been the principal Mana would have probably done the same thing, 
if not more.<br><br>
So it was that Nagase Kaede, 
the school's resident ninja - that is, ignoring the two sweet little 
girls trying hard to emulate their Kaede-nee - was added to the team, 
and Mana found herself being promoted to Setsuna's second-in-command. 
Considering the team as of yet consisted of three people, that was not 
an overbearing title, but from conversations with their employer Mana 
knew that a larger task-force was in the making. If such a thing were 
to get off the ground Mana felt she would have to ask for a considerate 
raise, all things considered.<br><br>
In regards to the newcomer, 
Mana was left somewhat bewildered. No-one could doubt Nagase Kaede's 
combat skills, she was a one-woman army and Mana was quite impressed. 
The trouble was not the good-natured woman's skill; it was the woman 
herself... for Nagase Kaede besides being a capable warrior was a person 
that was surprisingly kind, open, gentle and caring... qualities all 
that Mana had a hard time understanding, especially in a person on a 
warrior's path in life.<br><br>
Kaede obeyed orders, there 
were no problems there, and she was someone to depend on in a tight 
spot. They worked well together, and exterminating the random creatures 
that crossed Mahora borders became almost too easy with a small army 
of Kaede at her disposal. The ninja was even pleasant to talk to, once 
one got used to the almost permanent smile and her particular style 
of speaking.<br><br>
It was just...<br>
<br>
<i>It was just...</i><br>
<br>
It was just that when walking 
around on patrol with some small conversation going on with Setsuna, 
she and Mana had been friends and warriors, doing their duty. When Mana 
and Kaede walked around while on patrol and held a hushed conversation, 
Kaede was a woman taking off some of her warrior's mask to talk to 
another woman. Mana did not know how to act or react to Kaede, whereas 
with Setsuna they had been of similar ilk and therefore it was easy 
to understand her way of thinking. With the tall ninja Mana was left 
with the unnerving feeling that she truly had no idea how her mind worked.<br>
<br>
Despite her confusion Mana 
knew she was warming up to that persistent smile. Then Kaede had to 
go acting in a way that had Mana uncomfortably unsure of how to react.<br>
<br>
They had been walking along 
from a confrontation-site, the intrusion dealt with quickly and quietly, 
and the mood had been light and somewhat playful. Mana had chuckled 
at something Kaede had said, and the ninja had stopped on the spot.<br>
<br>
Turning to see what happened, 
Mana found herself face to face with Kaede at a considerably closer 
proximity than she felt at all comfortable with. Narrow eyes had peered 
at her with an expression Mana was unfamiliar with, and then Kaede had 
grinned widely.<br><br>
"You have a pretty smile, 
Tatsumiya-san, you should show it more often de gozaru."<br>
<br>
Then the ninja had bounced 
ahead, leaving the stunned and confused Mana to stare after her, wondering 
why in the world her heartbeat had picked up so strangely.<br>
<br>
--- <br><br>
It started with a simple compliment 
about her smile, but it didn't stop there. It was hard to pinpoint, 
being that it all amounted to but small innocuous things, but Mana felt 
she was getting surprising amounts of attention from the other girl. 
Perhaps it was just that Kaede wanted to make friends and Mana was unaccustomed 
to such behaviour, Mana thought and tried to put it out of her mind. 
It turned out to be not so easily done.<br><br>
Kaede's solicitousness of 
her had Mana somewhat jittery, and she did not want to think too closely 
about her own strange reactions to the ninja, oh no, having had an odd 
reaction to Setsuna was quite enough thank you very much. So it was 
with some relief she in class had opportunity to focus on said friend 
and her new and rather public relationship. For some reason her eyes 
kept going back to the tall girl against her will, and often Mana thought 
she could feel the ninja's eyes on her, though of course it was hard 
to tell if she was right or not.<br><br>
So when the opportunity presented 
itself, Mana chose the distraction of her friend's dilemma. Truly, 
the young couple was amusing to watch, adorable really, and their classmates 
weren't exactly making life easy for them with the sudden and immense 
interest. Yes, for shy and introvert Setsuna it must truly be a trial, 
but Mana was somewhat proud that her friend handled the pressure of 
the children's curiosity so well. Occasionally someone would take 
things a bit too far however, and for most of the time to Mana's way 
of seeing things that person seemed to be Asuna.<br><br>
Mana had watched with amusement 
as Asuna had teased and teased about Setsuna's apparent kissing ability, 
wanting to know her secrets and whatnot, and succeeding in making the 
pale warrior blush deeply every time. It was not that the girl was mean-spirited 
or meant any harm, Asuna just seemed the type to get caught up in what 
she was doing to the point she was blinded to her surroundings. Honestly, 
it had been quite fun... to begin with. Now it was somewhat tiresome 
and after seeing a strangely helpless look in her friend's eyes, Mana 
got just a little bit annoyed.<br><br>
"Come on, Ms Fabulous Kisser, 
give some hints to those of us less... experienced in the area." Asuna 
was teasing and Setsuna stuttering and waving her arms. Even Konoka 
for once tried to distract her roommate's attention from her lover, 
but Asuna was leaning over Setsuna's seat by then and just didn't 
notice her friend's subtle motions to cease.<br><br>
Mana rose smoothly from her 
seat, those few standing in the isle between the rows of seats before 
her parting in awe that the dark and silent markswoman was apparently 
participating in class on her own volition for once, nevermind why. 
Mana made not a sound until she walked up behind Asuna and tapped her 
politely on the shoulder.<br><br>
The tall redhead turned slightly 
towards her, and that was when Mana made her move.<br>
<br>
In one smooth and fast motion 
Mana spun the girl, clasped both her hands and put one behind Asuna's 
back as she dipped her low while keeping the girl close. She held the 
position and waited until the different coloured eyes cleared from the 
disorientation before speaking.<br><br>
"It would appear that what 
you are truly asking for is a demonstration of Setsuna's technique." 
The classroom went absolutely quiet while Mana spoke in her even tone, 
her face looking absolutely serious. "Since I doubt Konoka-ojousama 
would approve of such a demonstration, might I offer my own skills as 
a substitute?"<br><br>
Unknown to the suddenly bug-eyed 
spectators Mana's grip on the energetic girl's hands might have 
looked gentle enough, but with Mana's strength it was an easy task 
of holding Asuna completely in place. She was after all accustomed to 
handle the backlash of powerful guns that held nearly Asuna's mass 
and twice the kick.<br><br>
When panic grew in those wide 
eyes and Asuna opened her mouth to voice some sort of protest, Mana 
spoke again and derailed the attempt at resistance. "I take your lack 
of objections as a ‘yes', then." <br><br>
She inched her face dangerously 
close to the beet red girl whose eyes looked as if they were just about 
to pop out of their sockets. Of course Mana had no intention of kissing 
her classmate, annoying or no, but she would give a little scare and 
teach a lesson in her own way.<br><br>
Her focus naturally being on 
the girl in her arms, Mana had not particularly noticed the reactions 
of the rest of the classroom, specifically the no longer smiling ninja 
that was standing up in her seat behind them, and the furious and strangely 
pale blonde quickly coming around from the other direction.<br>
<br>
The book that slammed into 
her head did not particularly hurt, but it did startle Mana enough to 
jump back and lighten her hold on the redhead whom immediately squirmed 
out of her grasp. Looking up at the one that had struck her Mana came 
eye to eye with an infuriated Ayaka, ready to rant to high heavens.<br>
<br>
Honestly speaking Mana did 
not listen to a single word, and could not care less what the high-strung 
young woman was rambling on about this time since she had learned long 
ago that with this particular girl it was always <i>something</i>, however... 
looking into the fuming girl's eyes Mana saw not anger but pain, and 
the green eyes glittered with unshed tears. Still tuning out the voice 
that bellowed on Mana looked to her former captive, now standing on 
the other side of Ayaka and looking very sheepish and repentant. <br>
<br>
<i>Ahh, so that was how it 
was.</i><br><br>
"...IS ENOUGH! YOU HEAR ME? 
NO MORE!" Finally Ayaka wound down, panting slightly. After receiving 
confirming mumbles from a blushing Asuna Ayaka spun around and marched 
over to her own seat while Asuna, looking very much like a scolded little 
girl, apologized awkwardly to Setsuna before she slunk over to her own 
chair.<br><br>
Mana acknowledged Ayaka's 
declarations neither in word or deed, but she did spare the blonde a 
look that had her blushing in her seat as Mana calmly returned to her 
own. As she passed Kaede she found her gaze once again seeking her out, 
but to her surprise Kaede was turned away.<br><br>
It was strange how that simple 
sight of the other woman turned away from her had such a strong impact. 
Mana returned to her seat upset with herself and the situation, and 
very confused.<br><br>
Try though she did for the 
remainder of the school day, Mana never once managed to catch Kaede's 
eye.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
Patrolling with Kaede turned 
awkward in a new way for a few days after that. Although they worked 
as well as ever, the tendency to hold conversations and the curious 
attentiveness was mostly gone from their interactions and Mana found 
herself truly wanting to return to how things had been. About the only 
thing Mana could tell about her now far too silent companion was that 
Kaede's protective streak was as wide and strong as ever.<br>
<br>
That had been blatantly obvious 
as they were all three of them, Mana, Kaede and Setsuna, exterminating 
a small nest of a type of particularly nasty shadow-creatures that had 
quickly turned a section of the Mahora forest into their home. Dispatching 
the creatures were not that difficult despite the location, but for 
a brief moment when Mana was firing her guns at creatures in front of 
her, another one charged from the trees directly above her.<br>
<br>
Mana saw the creature although 
she did not acknowledge it, intent on her targets and secure in the 
knowledge that Setsuna was to her left and more than fast enough to 
clear her own opponent in time to keep the charging one from reaching 
Mana. She did not need time to consider her actions as this work pattern 
was something ingrained from many battles in the past, Mana focusing 
on long-range in such a situation while Setsuna could be counted upon 
to cover Mana's back.<br><br>
What happened instead was a 
small cry from Kaede and Mana instantly found herself tackled and covered 
by a body as large as her own, while the soft sound of cutting air declared 
that Yuunagi had arched above, severing the attacker in two.<br>
<br>
Even though Mana was startled, 
her senses clearly picked out the angry charging roar of the wounded 
creatures she had been firing at before being flattened on the ground, 
and so, grasping the body on top of her own with her legs and securing 
her guns in her hands, Mana flipped them over. As soon as she came into 
angle, flattening Kaede underneath her own body this time, Mana opened 
fire and emptied her magazines into the things.<br><br>
When the sound of her guns 
died out the forest around them was quiet and the creatures destroyed, 
still Mana performed a habit that had saved her life on many an occasion: 
immediately dropping the empty magazines and slapping full ones into 
their place.<br><br>
Setsuna watched them with a 
curious expression on her face as her companions remained lying crushed 
against one another during Mana's reload, and not until that was finished 
did either of them attempt to move. She looked between Mana who picked 
up her discarded magazines and pocketed them, and Kaede who was brushing 
herself off before collecting her weapons, and then Setsuna gave Mana 
a look that for some inexplicable reason had the dark warrior blush 
rather profusely.<br><br>
Setsuna did not question them, 
and neither Mana nor Kaede spoke a word of what had happened. Mana did 
however find herself looking at Kaede a lot when Kaede had her attention 
elsewhere, wondering what that had all been about.<br>
<br>
Then, with things continuing 
to be awkward, Saturday came along.<br><br>
It was a well-known fact that 
Kaede each Saturday set out for the wilder parts of Mahora for her supposedly 
secret ninja training, this time however... she invited the almost dumbfounded 
Mana to come along.<br><br>
Jumping at the chance to somehow 
settle this strangeness going on between them, Mana agreed to come, 
and uncharacteristically called in a few debts to make sure she could. 
Informed of what to bring Mana gathered her items and met up with Kaede 
to take off into the forest for, on Mana's part, parts unknown.<br>
<br>
Being an athlete herself besides 
a warrior, hiking the long distance while carrying a heavy backpack 
was not a problem for Mana, yet for some reason each time Kaede would 
turn to her with a smile something strange happened with Mana's breathing. 
The hike itself should not have caused too much of a strain, and still 
each time Kaede reached out to offer a hand over a particularly gnarled 
root or a treacherous rock, Mana found her heartbeat pick up, or there 
was a foreign kind of tingle in the pit of her stomach. What was going 
on with her?<br><br>
When finally Kaede took Mana's 
hand for some obstacle or other, and just seemed to conveniently forget 
to let go after it was cleared, a small smile found its way to Mana's 
lips. Kaede spoke for most of the trek, in a cheerful but quiet voice, 
regaling Mana with tales of her young roommates or funny things that 
had occurred to Kaede during training trips in the past. Mana found 
that she really, truly liked the sound of Kaede's voice, the warm 
lilt was soothing and the peculiar speech patterns and words charming 
beyond reason.<br><br>
Eventually they made it to 
Kaede's camping spot, a secluded clearing on high ground above the 
rushing river yet buffered from the wind on all sides but one. They 
set about putting up the tent and making camp right away, Mana following 
Kaede's smiling instructions, and soon enough the tent, campfire and 
other items were all in place.<br><br>
After setting camp Kaede declared 
that it was time to procure dinner, and Mana, glad that she had thought 
to add her small wooden arrow gun to her pack, followed her companion 
down to the rivers' edge.<br><br>
Kaede apparently used her throwing 
darts to catch fish among the rushes at that particularly rocky section 
of the river, giving Mana the idea that Kaede had a habit of turning 
everything into ninja training if given half the chance. Well, it was 
an admirable dedication, and she could not exactly fault her since Mana 
herself would spend most of her free time after work and shrine duties 
were done handling guns, performing maintenance, doing target practice 
or just plain breaking in a new one. Besides, the challenge of catching 
her food this way was somewhat... fun.<br><br>
Eagerly Mana stripped out of 
her pants and shirt, wading out into the water wearing only a T-shirt 
and her underwear, checking her gun and eyeing the silver forms darting 
past under the surface for an appropriate target. She was so focused 
on finding targets that she was only dimly aware of Kaede dropping her 
weapons inelegantly as she turned her head to find Mana half-naked in 
the water, and that she remained staring at Mana for a long moment before 
shaking herself and returning her focus to the fish.<br>
<br>
Mana did however notice Kaede's 
strange behaviour while she lay down to let her legs dry in the sun 
as they waited for the newly acquired fish to cook over the fire. The 
other girl was supposed to do some ninja training exercise or other, 
but kept stopping herself to stare at Mana every now and again, until 
Mana drew the conclusion that Kaede was just uncomfortable with her 
semi-undressed state and put her pants back on despite not being completely 
dry.<br><br>
She completely missed the small 
pout that was the ninja girl's immediate reaction before returning 
her focus to her training.<br><br>
After they had eaten their 
fish it was time to go scavenging through the forest for edibles for 
breakfast, though Mana, somewhat amused, thought it was just a convenient 
excuse on Kaede's part to go romping through the woods and generally 
goof off, since that was what the other girl seemed to be doing. The 
ultimate goal for the evening on the ninja's part seemed to be to 
make Mana laugh, and the attention Mana had missed the last couple of 
days she now got back, in spades.<br><br>
Privately Mana came to the 
conclusion that the reason Kaede used her multiplying ninja technique 
as they moved along was so that she could claim to get the job done 
while most of her were horsing around. This goofy playful side of Kaede 
was also utterly endearing, even if it was a strange animal to the world 
of Tatsumiya Mana. Mana found herself laughing, nearly to the point 
of doubling over, at the various antics of the Kaede-litter, and even 
blushing slightly at one point when the head of a Kaede - Mana had 
long since lost track of which one was the original - popped out upside-down 
in a tree directly in front of Mana and offered her a flower.<br>
<br>
Accepting the flower, if somewhat 
awkwardly, Mana carefully attached it to her breastpocket and watched 
the smiling Kaede bound away to join a few others. It was... <i>bewildering</i>.<br>
<br>
She had felt it before around 
Kaede, this strange... stirring... inside, though she had yet to grasp 
what it meant. All Mana knew for certain that it was Kaede alone who 
could move this deeply buried emotion inside her, and whatever it was 
had been locked away for so long that Mana no longer had a name to put 
to it.<br><br>
Finally it seemed the foraging 
and frolicking was done, the extra Kaede disappearing to leave only 
one widely smiling Kaede with an armload of various edible things the 
forest had provided. Sharing the weight between them they set back towards 
the camp at a leisurely pace, Mana pushing the other concerns to the 
back of her head, content instead with the apparent improvement in her 
conversational skills as she seemed able to keep Kaede amused, and genuinely 
glad that they had managed to move past the uneasiness that had coloured 
their interactions of late.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
When the sky began to darken 
Kaede told Mana that they should wash up and prepare for the night so 
that they could enjoy the spectacular view of the sunset that they would 
have from the high vantage point of their camp. Having no real objections 
to this Mana rummaged through her pack and headed down for the river's 
edge while Kaede was busying herself with the fire.<br>
<br>
A while later as Mana did a 
final splash of her face Kaede came searching for her, looking strangely 
stunned. "Tatsumiya-san, you are washing up in the river de gozaru?"<br>
<br>
"Yes... where else should 
I wash myself?" Mana turned towards the voice and smirked slightly 
as Kaede gave a start and turned to face the other way, apparently only 
just then realizing that Mana was nude. "And it is Mana, please." 
A soft chuckle under her breath. "Honestly, I think you might be nearly 
as shy as Setsuna."<br><br>
"Nin-nin." Kaede agreed, 
though to what was up to Mana to decipher. "This one is heating water 
for the barrel though de gozaru."<br><br>
Mana got out of the water and 
reached for her towel. "A barrel? You have dragged a barrel all the 
way out here to have a heated bath?" She laughed again. "I am beginning 
to think that this isn't somewhere you go to train, but rather your 
little resort spot away from it all... Kaede."<br><br>
The ninja managed to look sheepish 
even while turned away from her, one hand coming up to scratch her neck 
somewhat guiltily. "Will you not get... cold... de gozaru?"<br>
<br>
"I am a shrine maiden." 
Mana explained simply as she briskly dried herself off and picked up 
her clothes. "I have been purifying myself in cold water regardless 
of weather or season for... oh, years. I'm used to it."<br>
<br>
She tapped Kaede lightly on 
the shoulder. "You can look, I'm done. ...oh, don't force yourself 
to take a cold bath just because I did, now."<br><br>
And so Mana made her way back 
to the camp, not seeing the frown and small pout as Kaede examined the 
cold water's passage among the rocks.<br><br>
--- <br><br>
The evening had been... pleasant, 
very pleasant in fact, as they had watched the sunset sitting side by 
side, speaking occasionally but also enjoying a comfortable and companionable 
silence. It was peaceful, and Mana could understand why Kaede made this 
trip each week. Out there under the burning sky a lot of the weekly 
stress and agitation surely just dissolved, like steam in the open air.<br>
<br>
Somewhere during the last rays 
of the setting sun Mana found herself studying Kaede's profile, and 
made an impulsive offer that startled even herself a little.<br>
<br>
"Would you like to come to 
my shrine some weekend? It is a beautiful place... and peaceful... and 
I could even offer a hot bath." Here Mana grinned at her companion. 
"Although I understand that it is hard to tear yourself away from 
this view."<br><br>
Kaede smiled widely and nodded. 
"I would like that very much de gozaru."<br><br>
Finding herself mildly excited 
for some reason Mana immediately offered "Next weekend perhaps?"<br>
<br>
"Nin-nin!"<br>
<br>
Finally there had been little 
reason to remain outside as the skies had gone dark and the fire had 
been left to die down, and they decided to call it a night. It wasn't 
until just that moment that Mana fully realized how cramped things were 
in Kaede's little tent, or how intimate the simple double bedding 
that filled the narrow space would be. <br><br>
Still, although it was certainly 
an unusual situation for her it was not something that Mana would let 
herself be bothered with, so she picked a side and got under the cover. 
After a moment she could feel Kaede do the same behind her back, and 
in a hushed voice wished her goodnight. Closing her eyes with a small 
smile at the content and peaceful feeling she had inside, Mana expected 
to fall asleep quickly.<br><br>
She opened her eyes again an 
unknown length of time later, frustrated with herself.<br>
<br>
Forget tranquillity, Mana just 
Could Not Sleep, and she was getting annoyed. Not wanting to wake Kaede 
by moving around Mana decided to try a meditation technique in case 
that might help clear her far too active mind. It was at that moment 
that a warm body pressed against her back and a pair of arms and one 
leg wrapped around her. <br><br>
Again Mana's heartbeat sped 
up and she was left slightly breathless.<br><br>
She told herself it was nothing 
to get so worked up about, Kaede was probably just one of those people 
that tended to sleep wrapped around a pillow at night, and, unused to 
be sleeping with someone, had in her sleep assumed Mana to be that pillow.<br>
<br>
This little theory was instantly 
dashed when a warm voice spoke softly into her ear "Can't sleep 
de gozaru? Neither can this one."<br><br>
"Kaede? What are you doing?" 
When no answer was forthcoming and the body wrapped so nicely around 
hers was utterly unmoving, Mana spun herself to face Kaede in order 
to get her answers.<br><br>
Even in the dark Kaede's 
eyes were shining, and looking into them while pressed up against the 
other woman's warm, soft body, a strong jolt went through Mana.<br>
<br>
<i>Oh... so that was what it 
was.</i><br><br>
<i>Attraction.</i> Listening 
to her body Mana readily found the thrum of desire coursing through 
her. <i>Physical, yes, certainly.</i> Thinking back at her reactions 
to this person, the unusual upheaval where her emotions were concerned 
lately, and the strange urge to be near her. <i>Emotional... a strong 
possibility. </i>She traced a finger along Kaede's jaw, surprised 
at her own reaction to such a simple motion. <i>Perhaps already more 
than just a possibility.</i><br><br>
Mana wouldn't call it love, 
at least not yet. But perhaps... perhaps, with this one special person... 
it could be?<br><br>
Looking back into Kaede's 
eyes brought another, stronger, jolt, and then they were simply kissing, 
sweetly at first but soon hungrily, deeply. Kaede's hot hands against 
her skin lit a fire in Mana that was completely new, and consuming. 
In a few movements that were surprisingly swift, Mana divested herself 
of her clothes, the desire and emotion in Kaede's eyes making her 
shiver. Yes, Mana <i>wanted</i> this.<br><br>
Carefully she grasped the edge 
of Kaede's shirt and waited, not even in her haze of need and want 
about to go further than her hopefully soon-to-be lover would feel comfortable 
with.<br><br>
"Nin-nin."<br>
<br>
Kissing Kaede deeply in order 
to keep herself from bursting out in a girlish giggle at the adorable 
yet throaty and husky confirmation, Mana wasted no time in removing 
the last obstacles to that vast, soft and alluringly hot skin. After 
that point there was no turning back.<br><br>
There would be time for words 
of growing affection later, of promises for the future and the baring 
of wounded souls, as the light of morning slowly crept over the skies 
above. But for right that moment, in the heated and beautiful world 
of Nagase Kaede, Tatsumiya Mana, owner of a heart frozen for far too 
long, allowed herself to <i>burn</i>.<br><br>
