<h1>Quiet Morning (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sticky.html">Sticky the Dog</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/quietmorn-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>       The faintest tip of the sunrise peeked over the horizon, spilling 
the first glimpses of sunlight into all the windows of the dorm rooms in 
Mahora Academy. This light leaked slowly into a certain room: that which 
housed Negi, Asuna, and Konoka. On this particular morning, however, 
there were only two residents sleeping in this dwelling, only one of 
whom actually lived there.

       Konoka drew herself even closer to Setsuna, snuggling up to her 
side. Setsuna pulled Konoka&#39;s head into her chest, gently stroking her 
hair. Both girls were very peaceful, having just been awakened by the 
now-expanding sunlight. They had been sleeping together in this room for 
several nights now, the opportunity presented by the preparations for 
Mahorafest. After the late night sessions of setting up the classroom, 
Negi would go straight to preparing lesson plans or training with 
Evangeline, while Asuna went to deliver newspapers. That left Konoka by 
herself in the wee hours of the morning, so she had been inviting 
Setsuna to spend what was left of the night with her.

       They had yet to tell anyone about their relationship, but this 
provided them with the opportunity to spend a few brief hours with each 
other without the risk of being discovered. Konoka enjoyed doing this, 
it made it feel more like her and Setsuna were a real couple, even if 
they could not tell anyone about it. She would gladly tell her friends 
about the situation, but Setsuna seemed uneasy whenever Konoka brought 
up the subject. Konoka knew that Setsuna was a bit more shy than 
herself, but she worried about what might happen if they were discovered 
before they were ready to tell everyone.

       True to Konoka&#39;s assumption, Setsuna was worried about the 
security of their relationship. However, she was actually more worried 
about Konoka than she was about herself. Konoka&#39;s grandfather, the 
Headmaster, seemed to really be pushing Konoka to marry, what with his 
O-Miai setups, and Setsuna was unsure of how he would react to the truth 
about who his granddaughter really loved. Konoka&#39;s father, Eishun, had 
been aware of Setsuna&#39;s feelings for his daughter for some time now and 
had, on several occasions, urged Setsuna to be honest with her emotions. 
Setsuna wondered how he would react now, to know that Setsuna had 
finally opened herself up to Konoka, and that they were now truly in 
love because of that honesty.

       Noticing that the sun&#39;s gaze was filling the room completely now, 
Setsuna opened her eyes completely to the newly arrived morning. She 
lowered her eyes to look at the lightly sleeping form of Konoka, 
bringing her lips down to kiss her on the forehead. Konoka reacted to 
this touch and awakened, glanced up at Setsuna&#39;s face and smiled, then 
reburied her face affectionately in Setsuna&#39;s chest. Setsuna chuckled, 
then spoke quietly as she stroked Konoka&#39;s hair, &quot;Come on, it&#39;s time to 
get up. We can&#39;t stay here forever.&quot;

       Konoka mumbled back sleepily, &quot;But I wanna...I&#39;m tired...&quot; She 
tightened her arms&#39; grip on Setsuna, snuggling as hard as she could in 
an attempt to coax her back into relaxation.

       Setsuna sighed, still stroking Konoka, &quot;We have to be careful, 
remember. Asuna should be getting back from delivery soon.&quot; She sat up, 
letting Konoka slide down to her lap, though this did little to wake her 
any more. Setsuna smiled warmly, looking down at the content form of the 
girl she loved. &quot;Alright,&quot; she began, a new thought coming to her, &quot;if 
you get up, I&#39;ll buy you breakfast at the diner car.&quot;

       Her body still in a sleeping position, Konoka&#39;s eyes snapped 
open. She slid herself off of Setsuna&#39;s lap and sat up, letting out a 
long, tired yawn. Setsuna regarded her, thinking about how cute she 
looked doing that. She smiled, satisfied, and said, &quot;I thought so. Let&#39;s 
get going.&quot; She swiveled around to sit on the edge of the bed, pausing 
ever so momentarily to make sure that she was as awake as she thought 
she was. Deciding that she was ready, she got up and crossed to the 
dresser. She had been keeping a change of clothes in with Konoka&#39;s 
things since they had started doing this. As she dressed herself, Konoka 
slid out of bed, rubbing her eyes as she struggled to adapt to the 
too-quickly arrived morning. That was one reason that Konoka wanted so 
badly to make their relationship public. They wouldn&#39;t have to worry 
about hiding their love, and so would be able to spend more time just 
being together. Konoka would have traded all of her secrets right then, 
just to spend two more hours in bed with Setsuna.

       Setsuna, at this point, was all business. She dressed herself 
quickly, packed up her clothes from the previous night, and even made 
the bed as Konoka got dressed. Picking up her bag, she turned to face a 
partially dressed Konoka. Setsuna smiled at her brightly, something she 
had not done much before, but had taken to doing since becoming involved 
with Konoka. &quot;Alright,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll go wait outside, while you get 
yourself ready.&quot; She then took Konoka in her arms, peering into the eyes 
of the still half-asleep girl. &quot;Good morning, Kono-Chan,&quot; she greeted, 
then kissed her deeply. This brought Konoka from sleep fully; she closed 
her eyes and returned Setsuna&#39;s embrace, along with her kiss. They 
parted after a few seconds, both gazing into each others&#39; eyes. Even 
after separating from the arms of one another, they walked backwards to 
their separate destinations, keeping their gazes locked on each other.

       Setsuna finally got out the door, and closed it behind her, 
turning around to look like she had been standing there waiting the 
whole time. She fell back against the wall, breathing a sigh of relief. 
This secrecy was getting tiring; she was unsure of how long they could 
keep it up. True, it would be much more pleasant to just sleep in with 
Konoka, rather than rushing out every morning, but would people think? 
Class 3-A was not the quietest bunch of girls in the school, and Setsuna 
shuddered to think of the things they would say to her and Konoka. 
Setsuna was strong, she could withstand the verbal blows they would 
undoubtedly throw their way, but she worried about Konoka, who was much 
more emotional.

       She had walked out the door just in time, as Setsuna opened her 
eyes and looked down the hall to see Asuna coming back from her job, 
looking tired. She caught sight of Setsuna and smiled in greeting. 
&quot;Setsuna! Good morning.&quot;

       Setsuna, still surprised by how friendly Asuna always was towards 
her, blushed quickly, then bowed, &quot;Good morning...Asuna-san.&quot;

       Asuna continued smiling, &quot;Now, now, c&#39;mon. You know you don&#39;t 
have to be so formal with me.&quot;

       Setsuna straightened up, &quot;Right...sorry.&quot;

       Asuna placed a comforting hand on Setsuna&#39;s shoulder, and spoke 
gently, &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be sorry for, Setsuna. You are who you are, 
right?&quot; She gazed calmly at Setsuna&#39;s nervous face, which became 
incrementally less rattled with every passing second. Now Asuna smiled 
to herself. It felt good to know that she was contributing to a more 
sociable Setsuna. &quot;So,&quot; she began after a time, &quot;What are you doing at 
our place, anyway? Picking up Konoka again?&quot;

       For several days, &quot;picking up Konoka&quot; had been Setsuna&#39;s excuse 
for arriving so early. Asuna seemed to buy it, especially since the tow 
of them went off together in the morning anyway. However, Asuna was a 
perceptive person, and Setsuna had to wonder if Konoka had mentioned 
anything to her, as they were best friends.

       &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re going out again,&quot; Setsuna replied, &quot;I&#39;m going to buy 
her something for breakfast at Chao&#39;s diner car.&quot;

       Asuna grinned with purposeful suspicion, &quot;Going out for 
breakfast, huh? Sounds like a fun date.&quot;

       Setsuna quickly blushed again. &quot;No! Nothing like that! It&#39;s 
just...I know she likes food from the car, and, uh, I make a good bit of 
money, you know, what with the headmaster and all, and....uh, why would 
two girls go out on a date?! Everyone knows that that&#39;s some boys and 
girls who are couples do!&quot; She began panting, exasperated.

       Asuna chuckled, &quot;Relax, Setsuna. I was just joking, you know? You 
and Konoka can do whatever you want; it&#39;s none of my business.&quot;

       Setsuna continued with her desperate rambling, &quot;Well, that&#39;s 
okay, &#145;cause, all we&#39;re doing is...you know, friend stuff, like you two 
do...&quot;

       Asuna took her hand off of Setsuna&#39;s shaking shoulder, then 
yawned and stretched as Setsuna carried on. She waited for a break in 
the exposition, then interjected, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not trying 
to say anything. Just relax. I&#39;m going to bed; I&#39;ll tell Konoka you&#39;re 
out here.&quot; She opened the door to their room, and lazily walked in, just 
as Konoka stepped out, dressed and ready to go. She evaluated Setsuna&#39;s 
rattled form.

       &quot;Are you okay, Set-Chan?&quot; She asked with concern.

       Not wanting to worry Konoka, Setsuna regained her composure, then 
looked up at Konoka with all the confidence she could muster. &quot;Yes, 
don&#39;t worry about me, Kono-Chan. I&#39;m fine. Well, shall we go?&quot;

       Konoka smiled and nodded excitedly. &quot;Yeah! Let&#39;s go!&quot;

*       *       *

       The campus was alive with the air of the festival, and this 
excitement permeated the demeanor of every student at Mahora. They 
strode to their classes and clubs with a refreshing vigor, each one 
looking forward to whatever it was they headed towards. In the case of 
Konoka and Setsuna, they headed towards breakfast. Konoka looked forward 
to redeeming the offer that Setsuna had promised her, and Setsuna did 
not mind. Rather, she enjoyed all the mornings they had been spending 
together, and going out with Konoka for breakfast was no exception.

       Her arm wrapped around Setsuna&#39;s shoulder, Konoka pulled her 
towards a particularly set-off table. Still smiling sleepily, she sat 
down, with Setsuna sitting down on her left side. Not trying too hard to 
stay awake at this point, Konoka closed her eyes and let her head fall 
against Setsuna&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Kono-Chan...&quot; Setsuna began, glancing 
around nervously.

       &quot;Don&#39;t worry too much,&quot; Konoka said, her voice trailing off, 
&quot;Just let me stay like this for a minute, while I wake up...&quot; She yawned 
as she finished her sentence, and her consciousness gave way to slumber 
as she rested against the body of her lover.

       In this new dreamland, she brought herself back to where she had 
been only a few minutes before: In bed with Setsuna as the morning 
arrived. However, there was a difference between this vision and 
reality. Here, they slept in as long as they wanted, unworried about 
Asuna&#39;s arrival, as she knew of their relationship and was not surprised 
at all when she walked in and found them like this. The same was true 
for all of Konoka and Setsuna&#39;s classmates. They could freely express 
their love in front of all of them, and be supported in it. The same 
scene continued in Konoka&#39;s subconscious, with only one change occurring 
at the end now: She saw herself with Setsuna several years in the 
future, living together with the blessing of her grandfather, the 
Headmaster. For their love to continue forever, and for it to stop being 
a secret, that is what Konoka wanted now, more than anything.

       A soft rocking motion on her head finally woke her from this 
dream. She opened her weary eyes and looked at the amused face of 
Setsuna. &quot;Wake up now, or you&#39;ll miss the breakfast you were so eager to 
get,&quot; she said lightly. Konoka looked at the meal that Setsuna had 
apparently ordered for them. Among its ingredients was a cup of coffee, 
which Konoka, began sipping eagerly. She did not want to miss another 
moment of this day with Setsuna, even if the secrecy was less ideal than 
the openness she had experienced in her dream.

*       *       *

       Setsuna walked carefully into the room. She was completely unsure 
of what to expect; Asakura was a wild card that way. Why she had called 
Setsuna in was a mystery. Perhaps, with her life being endangered by 
Negi&#39;s enemies so much lately, Asakura wanted to ask Setsuna about what 
else she should watch out for, especially with a volatile event like 
Mahorafest on the horizon.

       The reporter had appeared quite suddenly before Konoka and 
Setsuna; her habit of being a paparazzi type clearly gave her an edge in 
stealth. She had simply asked that Setsuna come to her room for an 
&quot;interview&quot; of some sort, and that she come alone. Setsuna had agreed, 
despite Konoka&#39;s protests. Setsuna reassured the girl, and told her to 
spend some time with Asuna while she waited.

       Calming Konoka&#39;s nerves had done nothing to calm Setsuna&#39;s. It 
wasn&#39;t like she feared for her safety when it came to Asakura. She was 
more worried about being asked to reveal information about the world of 
magic to someone who would undoubtedly publish her findings for all of 
the school to see. Silently, Setsuna promised herself that she would not 
reveal anything to Asakura, unless she felt that she would actually be 
safer for it.

       Distracted by her thoughts, Setsuna was once again taken surprise 
by the sudden appearance of Asakura, who grinned expectantly at Setsuna 
quick jerk of a reaction. She extended her hand in greeting. &quot;Thanks for 
taking me up on this, I know it was kind of short notice,&quot; she said in a 
friendly, relaxed manner.

       Setsuna took her hand and shook it, eyeing Asakura suspiciously, 
but doing so as subtly as possible, &quot;It was no problem,&quot; she said 
carefully, &quot;I haven&#39;t had too much important to do anyway.&quot;

       &quot;Is that so,&quot; Asakura replied, her voice clearly enunciating with 
disbelief. She motioned to her bed, &quot;Have a seat, why don&#39;t you? Let&#39;s 
make this as comfortable as possible.&quot;

       Setsuna walked carefully towards the bed, trying to keep her eyes 
on Asakura at all times. &quot;You still haven&#39;t told me why I&#39;m here,&quot; she 
inquired, her voice reaching a clear crescendo of suspicion.

       Asakura followed Setsuna as she walked, speaking assuredly. &quot;I 
just have a few questions I wanted to ask you. Information is my job, 
after all, and I&#39;m just seeing if there&#39;s any you can provide me with.&quot; 
They finally reached the bed, Setsuna sitting at the foot and Asakura 
sitting at the head.

       Setsuna straightened herself, trying to look as stoic as 
possible. &quot;If it&#39;s about anything magical, there&#39;s a definite limit to 
what I can and can&#39;t say, so don&#39;t expect to get all the &#145;information&#39; 
you may want.

       &quot;It&#39;s nothing about magic,&quot; Asakura countered, leaning in close 
to Setsuna&#39;s face as she spoke, &quot;I have questions about you.&quot;

       Setsuna&#39;s face flushed, becoming embarrassed at the very thought 
of telling Asakura anything about her personal life. Setsuna quickly 
regretted giving into this embarrassment, as she was sure that her 
obvious discomfort would only prompt Asakura to dig deeper for whatever 
it was she was searching for. Asakura wasted no time in acting on 
Setsuna&#39;s fears.

       &quot;Are you dating anyone right now?&quot; she asked plainly.

       Konoka&#39;s face flashed in Setsuna&#39;s mind, and her face grew an 
even deeper shade of red. She concentrated hard, and answered. &quot;No. I&#39;m 
not dating anyone...&quot;

       Asakura feigned surprise. &quot;Really? Why not? There&#39;re plenty of 
good-looking, eligible guys at this school. Maybe someone from the kendo 
club...&quot;

       Setsuna looked downward, focusing on not looking Asakura in the 
eyes, &quot;Well,&quot; she began, becoming more nervous every second, &quot;It&#39;s just 
that I can&#39;t, you know, I can&#39;t find anyone I really like...&quot;

       Though it was blatantly obvious at this point, Asakura continued 
with her charade of shock. &quot;There&#39;s not a single guy at this school that 
interests you?!&quot;

       &quot;Not...not really,&quot; Setsuna replied quietly.

       &quot;Well,&quot; Asakura thought aloud, &quot;Have you ever considered the 
notion that guys may not be your type?&quot;

       Setsuna&#39;s head snapped up in immediate defense. &quot;What?&quot; She said 
desperately, looking all around the room in a frenzied panic. &quot;What do 
you mean by that?&quot;

       &quot;I mean,&quot; Asakura began, the tension rising in her voice as she 
brought her face inches within Setsuna&#39;s, &quot;That maybe you&#39;re the type of 
girl who likes...other girls.&quot;

       Setsuna was about to cry out in shock again, but her incoming cry 
was stifled by Asakura&#39;s lips wrapping themselves around her own.

       There was an overwhelming torrent of thoughts and emotions 
whipping themselves around Setsuna&#39;s mind as this sudden, involuntary 
kiss with Asakura became something she could not stop. The two thoughts 
that stood out in this storm of consciousness were a realization, and a 
question. The realization was that Asakura must know about her 
relationship with Konoka. Setsuna cursed herself for not seeing it 
sooner, as all of Asakura&#39;s actions leading up to this point had made it 
painfully obvious. This led to the question Setsuna had, which was &quot;Why 
hasn&#39;t she told anyone? Why is she doing this instead?&quot;

       Seemingly in response to that inquiry, Asakura released her mouth 
from Setsuna&#39;s, gazing into her eyes dreamily. &quot;How was that?&quot; she asked 
softly. Setsuna reverted to her previous routine of glancing away from 
Asakura, who did not even wait for an answer. She began to slowly slide 
herself around Setsuna, bringing her head to rest on her left shoulder. 
She breathed slow, steady air into Setsuna&#39;s ear.

       Setsuna finally brought herself to reply to Asakura. &quot;I 
think...you might be right.&quot; She said cautiously.

       &quot;I thought so,&quot; Asakura said, her voice swelling with confidence, 
&quot;So I&#39;ll ask you one more time: Are you dating anyone right now?&quot; 
Asakura spoke differently from when she had last posed the question. It 
definitely had a rhetorical sense about it, and this time, Setsuna 
detected its intention. She decided to stand her ground, for the sake of 
her love for Konoka.

       &quot;No,&quot; she said with as much assuredness as she could muster, 
&quot;There isn&#39;t anyone I&#39;m seeing.&quot;

       &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Asakura said back, a reply which surprised 
Setsuna, &quot;That&#39;s lucky for me,&quot; she completed, then wrapped her hands 
around Setsuna&#39;s breasts, and plunged her tongue into her ear.

       This time, Setsuna was able to let loose a yelp of surprise. 
Hundreds of thoughts flashed through her mind, and all of them involved 
Konoka. What would she think? Would she find out? Could Setsuna still 
stop this, or had she already gone far enough to hurt her? &quot;I...&quot; 
Setsuna gasped, tears welling up in her eyes as Asakura undid her shirt, 
allowing her hands to toy with Setsuna&#39;s bare chest, &quot;I can&#39;t...do 
this...please...&quot;

       &quot;What?&quot; Asakura teased, &quot;You said you aren&#39;t seeing anyone, and 
you like girls. What&#39;s the problem? I&#39;m good enough for you, right?&quot; She 
began sliding her right hand down Setsuna&#39;s stomach.

       &quot;I...I might&#39;ve lied...when I said that I...that I wasn&#39;t seeing 
anyone...&quot; Setsuna said, in between hard gasps.

       Asakura&#39;s hand stopped at the top of Setsuna&#39;s skirt. It hovered 
there, ready to pull it down at a moment&#39;s command. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;If 
you are seeing someone, then you shouldn&#39;t be doing this, should you?&quot;

       Setsuna sniffed, tears now fully streaming down her face. &quot;No,&quot; 
She said, sobbing, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

       &quot;But...&quot;Asakura began, her voice giving off a chastising tone, 
&quot;Why should I believe you? You could just be making this up. After all, 
I haven&#39;t heard anyone mention that they were seeing you. Can you give 
me a name, Setsuna?&quot;

       Setsuna, in full blown tears, cried out, &quot;Konoka!&quot; She put her 
head in her hands, turned around, and cried into Asakura&#39;s chest. &quot;I 
love Konoka...&quot; she sobbed.

       Asakura stroked Setsuna&#39;s head comfortingly, allowing her to let 
out all the feelings she had been keeping inside, revealing only to 
Konoka.

*       *       *

       Setsuna finally got out the door, and closed it behind her, 
turning around, and not bothering to look like she had been there the 
whole time. She took notice of Asuna when she appeared at the end of the 
hallway, and walked out to meet her.

       &quot;Setsuna?&quot; Asuna said, honestly surprised. &quot;What is it?&quot;

       &quot;I have something to tell you, before we tell everyone else,&quot; 
Setsuna said, her voice exuding a confidence she had lacked the day 
before, &quot;It&#39;s about me and Kono-Chan...&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, there you go! Chapter 3 complete at last! AS you may have noticed, 
it&#39;s fairly large, accounting for its increased composition time. And 
not much of it was lemony goodness, now was it? *Laughs* Well, I hope 
you enjoyed it anyway, even if it did lack an actual Kono-on-Setsu 
scene. I will continue writing into next month, but I&#39;ll be taking a 
break from this story to write one that *gasp* isn&#39;t a KonoSetsu fic!</pre>
