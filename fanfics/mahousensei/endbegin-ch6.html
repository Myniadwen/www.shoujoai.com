<h1>Endings and Beginnings (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/endbegin-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Collet Rallendoll took a nervous breath, her dog-like ears perking up a 
bit. Her dark skin and brown hair went well with her school uniform, not 
to mention her mage-knight gear, but in times like these she wished she 
could stand out a bit more.

Ever since she had first met the two strangers Collet had found herself 
growing more and more interested. At first she had been drawn to 
Setsuna, but recently she found herself becoming very aware of Asuna 
Kagurazaka. The orange haired girl was surprisingly down to earth for a 
legend, fun to be around and very attractive. In fact it was taking a 
great deal of Collet&#39;s willpower not to do something rash.

Reaching the door Collet knocked briskly then stuck her head in and 
cheerfully called, &quot;Hello!&quot; As Asuna waved her in she walked up to the 
table the three women were sitting at, looking at the third woman 
warily. There was a dangerous aura around the black haired stranger, 
even if she did have a friendly smile.

Setsuna politely introduced them, then she looked at Collet shyly. 
&quot;Could I ask a question?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Collet said as she bounced into a seat, looking over at Setsuna 
curiously.

&quot;Would I,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s cheeks went red, &quot;be breaking any rules if I asked 
the headmistress to join me for dinner?&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Collet said without hesitation, fighting back a smile at 
how obviously smitten Setsuna was, &quot;in fact, as you&#39;re not a student and 
not on staff, you&#39;re one of the few who can.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Setsuna looked like she was digesting that fact as she murmured, 
&quot;thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Collet laughed. She looked over at Asuna, &quot;Speaking of 
dinners....&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Asuna looked at her curiously.

Collet worked to keep herself from blushing as she nervously asked her, 
&quot;Are you doing anything for dinner?&quot;

Asuna looked at her in surprise then she smiled as she answered, &quot;Well, 
I didn&#39;t have anything planned, but Mana....&quot;

Mana shook her head as she murmured, &quot;I was planning to meet with a 
associate at the school tonight, actually. So don&#39;t think you need to 
keep me entertained.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Collet winked, &quot;everyone&#39;s happy. You see your friend, I&#39;ll take 
Asuna and Setsuna can go ask Naoko out.&quot;

&quot;And hopefully jump Naoko&#39;s bones,&quot; Asuna added.

&quot;Asuna!&quot; Setsuna blushed as she protested, &quot;I haven&#39;t even decided to 
ask her out yet, much less....&quot;

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Asuna gently hit her on the shoulder, &quot;I swear, you&#39;re 
more scared of Naoko than you were of a dragon.&quot;

&quot;A dragon can only kill me,&quot; Setsuna said dryly.

&quot;Better to die once,&quot; Mana noted, &quot;then die a thousand times running 
away.&quot; She gave Setsuna a sympathetic look, &quot;You know you want to ask 
her out.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m sure she wants you too,&quot; Collet said firmly. She smiled, 
&quot;Besides, just look at it as repaying the favor of her having dinner 
with you.&quot;

Setsuna took a deep, steadying breath, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; She picked up the 
phone and dialed, &quot;Naoko, it&#39;s Setsuna.&quot; Her face seemed to light up as 
her listened to the other woman talk, &quot;I was wondering... would you like 
to go out with me for dinner.&quot;

Both Asuna and Collet saw Setsuna grin at hearing Naoko&#39;s reply, then 
Mana silently got up. &quot;Shall we go?&quot; she murmured to them quietly. All 
three girls slipped away, giving Setsuna a bit of privacy.

&quot;Thanks for encouraging her,&quot; Asuna told both Mana and Collet. She 
smiled wryly, &quot;If I heard her waffle about Naoko much longer, I was 
going to do something rash.&quot;

&quot;Like?&quot; Collet had to asked.

&quot;Lock then both in a room and keep &#39;em in there using magic cancel until 
they DID something,&quot; Asuna shrugged.

Mana actually smiled slightly, &quot;I think I would have liked to see that.&quot; 
She added quietly, &quot;I was serious about needing to see a associate 
tonight... but I&#39;ll catch up with you later.&quot;

&quot;See you later,&quot; Collet smiled as the other woman strode away.

Asuna and Collet walked along a hallway from the suite then out into a 
garden, the moon shining down upon them and making the paths easily 
navigatable, even with the soft glow of the magic lights. Asuna followed 
Collet curiously, her expression both open to the experience yet also 
understandably wary.

&quot;So,&quot; Asuna finally asked, &quot;is this a friendly dinner or...?&quot;

&quot;Instead of a hostile dinner?&quot; Collet joked.

Asuna laughed, &quot;Is that a dinner where you snip at each other over the 
main course then have a duel for desert?&quot;

Collet shook her head, &quot;As long as the wine isn&#39;t poisoned.&quot; She looked 
over at Asuna shyly, &quot;I&#39;d like to think we&#39;ve become friends.&quot;

&quot;We have,&quot; Asuna agreed with a smile.

Collet smiled back shyly as she explained, &quot;I really like you, Asuna, 
and I&#39;d like to get to know you better.&quot;

Asuna nodded as she said, &quot;I like you, too, but....&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Collet urged her on.

Asuna blushed, &quot;I&#39;m not into girls like Setsuna is.&quot;

Collet chuckled softly, &quot;Oh, really?&quot; As Asuna looked at her 
questioningly Collet winked, &quot;I saw you looking at women at the baths, 
Asuna.&quot;

Asuna went beet red. &quot;Everyone does that,&quot; she protested weakly.

Collet dropped her voice as she teased, &quot;But I bet everyone&#39;s nipples 
don&#39;t get hard while they&#39;re watching.&quot;

Asuna covered her face with her hand as she muttered, &quot;Wow, you really 
were paying attention to me....&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Collet chuckled. She smiled warmly at Asuna, &quot;All I want is for 
you to give me a chance, all right?&quot;

Asuna smiled back, her cheeks still cute and red from the fierce blush. 
&quot;I think I can do that,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;Good,&quot; Collet nodded, &quot;I know a nice caf&eacute; we can go to for dinner too.&quot;

While part of the larger academy complex the Caf&eacute; was near the outer 
edge of the campus, nearby a grove of trees. The peaceful scene was very 
fitting for the large but not sprawling building, the tables scattered 
around the interior to give moderate privacy. Waiters and waitresses 
hurried about, carrying loaded trays of food and drink as well as 
guiding guests to their tables.

&quot;What a nice place,&quot; Asuna admitted as she looked around.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty popular,&quot; Collet agreed as a waiter guided them to a cozy 
corner table.

The waiter smiled as he flipped open his note pad, &quot;The daily special is 
wyvern soup, we also have gryphon roast and a nice wine.&quot;

&quot;Is that the one Setsuna and I stopped?&quot; Asuna asked curiously.

&quot;Miss Kagurazaka?&quot; the waiter looked at her in surprise then he smiled 
at her, &quot;On the house, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to...,&quot; Asuna blushed.

The waiter chuckled, &quot;You helped the city, a free meal or two is a small 
reward.&quot;

&quot;Let it go, okay?&quot; Collet smiled gently. As the waiter hurried off she 
added, &quot;What was that about?&quot;

Asuna looked a bit sheepish. &quot;I&#39;m used to paying my own way,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;ever since I was a young woman. It&#39;s kind of a habit, I 
guess.&quot;

Collet nodded understandingly, &quot;I understand. Why not pay next time, 
then?&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Asuna nodded as they watched people go by the window.

&#39;How does she see us?&#39; Collet wondered as a cat girl, wolf man and many 
other types wandered by. She had heard that Asuna was actually born in 
their world but had spent much of her life in the human world....

&quot;Here we are,&quot; the waiter declared grandly as he delivered their plates. 
&quot;Medium roast for Collet, well done for Asuna as ordered,&quot; he added as 
he set the plates down.

&quot;It smells wonderful,&quot; Asuna beamed.

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Collet added as he left their drinks.

&quot;Enjoy your meal, ladies,&quot; he smirked, &quot;I hope you have a lovely date.&quot;

Asuna blushed as he hurried off, &quot;How did he know...?&quot;

Collet chuckled softly, &quot;He&#39;s a student at the academy with a bit of 
foresight.&quot; Asuna looked at her questioningly and Collet elaborated, &quot;He 
can see the future. It&#39;s how he got our orders right without us having 
to tell him.&quot;

&quot;That must be helpful,&quot; Asuna mused as they dug in.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Collet laughed, &quot;imagine trying to have a conversation 
with siomeone who knows what you&#39;re going to say in advance.&quot;

&quot;Awkward,&quot; Asuna conceded, smiling faintly.

&#39;Though I wish I knew what you&#39;re thinking,&#39; Collet thought wryly as she 
ate, too.
