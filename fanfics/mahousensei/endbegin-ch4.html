<h1>Endings and Beginnings (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a>

<a href="../mahousensei/endbegin-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Naoko Konoe smiled as she worked to clear her desk, the woman&#39;s long 
black hair weld back with simple silver clips. Despite all her efforts 
there was always more paperwork to do, ranging from budget requests to 
student issues.

&#39;And occasionally,&#39; Naoko thought as she smiled at the document she was 
studying, &#39;we get good news.&#39;

Both Setsuna Sakurazaki and Asuna Kagurazaka had formally requested her 
permission to stay in Ariadne, something that Naoko was quite happy to 
grant. She rather expected several professors to ask them if they&#39;d 
either student teach or demonstrate their skills in class. In fact, 
Naoko rather suspected Setsuna could teach a class on swordsmanship 
herself.

&#39;Ah, Setsuna...,&#39; Naoko thought a bit guiltily of the black haired young 
woman.

Naoko had received a letter from Negi Springfield the other day, 
tactfully sketching in the details of Setsuna&#39;s relationship with her 
niece, Konoka. To be honest she hadn&#39;t really needed the letter, just 
talking to Setsuna had made her aware that the young woman&#39;s heart had 
been broken fairly recently. She wanted to reach out to her and try to 
make it all better and she was also aware of a twinge of attraction 
there too.

&#39;Which is a extremely bad idea,&#39; Naoko thought to her self quite 
sternly. It was just her poor luck that her usual type of attraction was 
tall, intense, female and black haired, all of which described Setsuna 
nearly perfectly. With wry humor she cursed that her niece had been the 
first one to meet Setsuna...

Finishing up her filing and writing Naoko rose, chanting a soft spell 
under her breath to put the remaining items away until tomorrow morning. 
Drawing her coat around her she left her office, putting out the lights 
as she strolled through the local section of the academy grounds. 
Students called out greetings as she walked by them to her quarters, 
changing from her scholars robes to more relaxed garb.

Naoko removed her hair clips and tied her hair back in a simple 
ponytail, letting it shimmer down her back in a glossy wave. She picked 
out a slim, tight shirt then hauled on a simply designed set of shorts 
before deciding she was dressed enough. Gazing at her shower a moment 
Naoko made a face, deciding she&#39;d rather go to the public baths a get 
clean, so she gathered up her supplies and headed out.

It wasn&#39;t that busy of a night, and Naoko was thankfully if wasn&#39;t 
Friday or the weekend, where students rushed to bathe before going out. 
Instead the woman&#39;s side was merely filled with women scrubbing 
themselves clean, rinsing then climbing into the water for a good long 
soak in the steaming water.

Following suit Naoko stripped off her clothes and left them in a locker, 
walking over to benches where women were helping each other wash. She 
was just sitting down when a familiar voice called, &quot;Hello, 
Naoko-sensei&quot;

&quot;Hello, Collet-chan,&quot; Naoko politely returned the greeting as her eyes 
settled on the two young women lounging in the steam nearby.

Asuna wore a towel that strained to cover her full breasts but Naoko 
only had eyes for the woman sitting beside her. Setsuna was blushing 
slightly as she sat up, her small, perfectly shaped breasts rising 
against her towel under the water. Her skin was pale, almost shimmering 
in the steam and her dark eyes seemed to capture Naoko&#39;s.

&quot;Sensei,&quot; Setsuna blushed as her eyes almost unwillingly swept over 
Naoko&#39;s barely covered body, lingering here and there at certain 
prominent assets.

&#39;She likes what she sees,&#39; Naoko thought with a tiny shiver of 
satisfaction as she stretched out to scrub at her arm. &quot;Hello Asuna, 
Setsuna,&quot; she smiled at the older girls, &quot;how are you liking our baths?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re very nice,&quot; Asuna answered promptly, &#39;Why, it nearly matches 
the ones back at our old school.&quot;

Letting her towel fall away Naoko scrubbed her breasts, foaming up each 
one thoroughly as she snuck glances at the now furiously blushing 
Setsuna. Taking a basin of warm water she rinsed herself free of any 
remaining soap, picking up her towel and sauntering towards the three 
girls. &quot;Would you mind,&quot; Naoko addressed Collet as she prepared to climb 
in, but keeping an eye on the other two woman too.

&quot;Please join us,&quot; Collet agreed.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Naoko answered as she dipped a toe into the hot water and 
sighed in pleasure from the heat. With no further hesitation she climbed 
in, nearly moaning in pleasure from the sensations.

Setsuna coughed to clear her throat and she still sounded a bit rough as 
she said, &quot;Thank you so much for the rooms Asuna and I are using.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no trouble,&quot; Naoko smiled warmly, &quot;I firmly believe that you two 
will prove to be more valuable than two rooms could be.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Asuna accepted the compliments with a warm smile.

Naoko sat back in the water and closed her eyes, sighing in pleasure as 
the warm heat made her breasts bounce a bit in the water. Covertly she 
took a peek and saw Setsuna still blushing as she gazed at her 
longingly. &#39;You&#39;re a very wicked woman,&#39; Nicole thought to herself 
contentedly, closing her eyes once more.

The heat seemed to take the day&#39;s worries away, as well as providing 
some perspective on the day&#39;s problems. All four relaxed more and more 
under the steam, exchanging pleasant conversation as they each relaxed. 
&#39;Do I really need to worry about the feelings my niece left behind?&#39; 
Naoko mused. Yes, she knew she would need to give SEtsuna time to 
recover, but that didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t get to know the girl 
better...

&quot;This is wonderful,&quot; Collet sighed happily, the smaller girl&#39;s whole 
body nearly soaking in the large heated pool.

Finally and reluctantly Naoko got up, water splashing off her womanly 
body as she stretched. She gracefully twisted a bit as muscles popped 
softly, then let herself relax as she caught a drooping edge of towel 
that nearly revealed a bit too much of her breast. &#39;Setsuna saw that,&#39; 
Naoko noted the girl&#39;s blushing and looking away while hiding a soft 
chuckle.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Asuna murmured scoldingly while a smile twitched on her lips as 
she and the others began to climb out too.

Hearing her stomach grumble complainingly at her Naoko asked them all, 
&quot;Have you had your dinner yet?&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Collet smiled as they walked together to the change rooms, &quot;but 
these two were busy finishing up a demonstration with the Mage Knights.&quot;

&quot;How did it go?&quot; Naoko asked them curiously as she casually undid her 
towel and let it drop to the floor.

&quot;Fairly well,&quot; Setsuna admitted as she looked away modestly, &quot;we took 
all ten Mage Knights down without hurting them.&quot;

Asuna waved that off as they all retrieved their clothes and dried off, 
&quot;We did have magic cancel going for us too.&quot;

&quot;Next session we&#39;ll start working with them on developing anti-swords 
tactics,&quot; Setsuna said, apparently feeling the need to reassure the 
headmistress a bit.

Naoko chuckled as she slipped on her shorts over her lacy black 
underwear, &quot;Trust me, I want the Mage Knights to have the hardest times 
here as possible, rather than facing that out in the real world.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Collet agreed, nodding cheerfully as she pulled on a 
simple shirt and pants.

Naoko found her eyes lingering as Setsuna shyly removed her towel, 
revealing a graceful and muscular body with perky breasts and slim hips. 
She dressed quickly, almost as if she was ashamed of her nudity, 
covering it with clothes resembling the garb of a samurai.

&#39;She&#39;s so beautiful,&#39; Naoko thought as Asuna dressed quickly nearby, 
&#39;but it&#39;s like she doesn&#39;t know it at all.&#39; She fought to contain a 
flash of anger as she mused, &#39;Did Konoka&#39;s rejection do that to her?&#39;

&quot;You were asking about dinner?&quot; Asuna asked with a slight smile.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Naoko nodded to Asuna for the reminder, &quot;I was wondering if 
you&#39;d like to join me for a meal. I was thinking we could talk about how 
you can help the school and how the school can help you...&quot;

Setsuna nodded as she belted her sword to her side, &quot;I&#39;d be honored to 
join you for dinner, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Good, you can tell me all about it,&quot; Asuna said calmly, but a slightly 
impish twinkle was in her eyes.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Setsuna looked at her in surprise.

Asuna shrugged slightly as she explained, &quot;I promised to talk to a 
researcher later tonight about looking into my family.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Setsuna nodded, &quot;right. Collet...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m stuffed,&quot; Collet said quickly, &quot;but don&#39;t let me stop you.&quot;

Naoko fought the urge to chuckle softly at both young woman. &#39;I can&#39;t 
tell if Asuna wants to protect Setsuna from me.&#39; she thought wryly, &#39;or 
encourage me to go after her. Maybe It&#39;s a little bit of both?&#39; Clearing 
her throat she smiled at the clearly nervous Setsuna, &quot;Well, I guess 
it&#39;s just you and me?&quot;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; Setsuna agreed.

&quot;I hope you two have a good time,&quot; Asuna called as she grabbed Collet 
and the two headed off.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Collet waved as she was dragged away.

Naoiko managed to turn her chuckle into a cough, covering up her mouth 
with her cupped hand. Clearing her throat she said gently, &quot;Why don&#39;t we 
go to the academy cafeteria? They serve dinner till late.&quot;

Setsuna smiled back, &quot;Thank you, I&#39;d like that very much.&quot;
