<h1>The Unexpected Guest (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mahousensei/index.html">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mahousensei/unexpected-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Negi-sensei,&quot; Kaede sat at the table with Negi, cups of tea in front of 
them as she explained, &quot;a Oni that my ancestor defeated has come to 
Mahora academy, originally intending to defeat me. However, when we 
fought we discovered a... attraction between us. I wanted to ask you for 
help and advice.&quot;

&quot;Could you repeat that?&quot; Negi Springfield blinked in confusion, the 
brown haired boy looking first at Kaede Nagase then at the redheaded Oni 
standing behind her.

&quot;My name is Uzume,&quot; the redheaded woman smiled, twin horns sticking up 
from her hair as she took a turn, &quot;I intended to take vengeance against 
this ninja for her family&#39;s sins, but I seem to have fallen for her 
instead.&quot; She cuddled close to Kaede, her full breasts barely contained 
by the tiger stripped bikini she wore.

It took Negi a few moments to process that, but he was managing. &quot;So,&quot; 
he continued, &quot;what would you like me to do?&quot;

&quot;Could you let the Headmaster know she&#39;s on campus and that she&#39;s mostly 
harmless?&quot; Kaede scratched the back of her head and smiled at him wryly, 
&quot;I&#39;d rather not have Mana or Setsuna sent after her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Negi promised.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Uzume waved cheerfully as she followed Kaede out of the room, 
her hips swaying with a unconscious sexiness.

&quot;That&#39;s so romantic,&quot; Konoka exclaimed, her long, glossy black hair 
falling in a wave down her back.

Asuna blinked, her orange hair tied back in two ponytails by her bell 
hair ties. &quot;You have a interesting definition of romantic,&quot; she said 
with a smile.

&quot;Actually from what I&#39;ve read that&#39;s pretty typical of Oni courtship,&quot; 
Negi tried to recall, &quot;they only respect those that can defeat them in 
battle.&quot;

&quot;I think they&#39;re a cute couple,&quot; Konoka smiled sweetly.

Walking down the hall Uzume seemed entirely unbothered by the looks she 
drew from the students they passed as she asked Kaede, &quot;Okay, what now?&quot;

&quot;Not sure,&quot; Kaede admitted.

&quot;It&#39;s the weekend and your out of classes,&quot; Uzume grinned as she cooed, 
&quot;do you want to go out somewhere?&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but...&quot; Kaede looked at Uzume thoughtfully, &quot;you&#39;re going to 
draw a lot of attention dressed like that?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Uzume posed for Kaede sexily, the bikini top and 
bottom highlighting her best assets.

&quot;I like it fine,&quot; Kaede grinned back, &quot;I&#39;m just scared you&#39;ll cause a 
riot.&quot;

Uzume laughed heartily at that. &quot;Sounds fun,&quot; she grinned, &quot;so do you 
have a plan to do something about it?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to do what any ninja would,&quot; Kaede said to her cheerfully, 
&quot;we&#39;re going to find you a disguise.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Chizuru Naba smiled merrily as she opened her door, the room that 
she shared with Natsumi and Ayaka.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Uzumi waved, mildly impressed that the young woman&#39;s 
measurements were nearly a match for her own.

&quot;I need to ask a favor,&quot; Kaede admitted as they followed the 
reddish-brown haired young woman inside.

&quot;Clothes for you friend?&quot; Chizuru clapped her hands together eagerly 
once she finished explaining, &quot;Of course you can borrow them.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what you meant?&quot; Uzume looked at Kaede.

&quot;That bikini alone will stop traffic otherwise,&quot; Kaede noted wisely.

&quot;Not to mention the thong,&quot; Chizuru added.

&quot;Hey, wait a minute,&quot; Usume blinked as Chizuru bodily pulled her towards 
the closets on the other side of the room.

&quot;I have just the thing,&quot; Chizuru said to her cheerfully as she rummaged 
around, pulled several bundles of clothes out then dragged Uzume over to 
the bathroom.

&quot;You can change clothes out here too, you know,&quot; Kaede said dryly from 
where she had sat down to wait.

&quot;I want it to be a surprise,&quot; Chizuru said with a impish twinkle in her 
eye.

&quot;I have a bad feeling about this,&quot; Uzume muttered under her breath as 
she was tugged into the smaller room.

Kaede grinned to herself as she listened to Uzume&#39;s various weak 
protests as Chizuru stripped her naked then began getting some clothes 
on her. Chizuru could be a real force of nature when she decided on 
something, it was partially because of that she took Uzume here rather 
than to Mana or another busty student.

&quot;No, I...why the underwear for demon&#39;s sake?&quot; Uzume was heard 
protesting.

&quot;But they&#39;ll look so good on your figure!&quot; Chizuru purred.

Kaede just shook her head and smiled.

&quot;And now,&quot; Chizuru stepped out first, &quot;miniskirt Uzume!&quot;

Uzume followed, the blue miniskirt and matching top hugging her body, 
making her look more sexy than the revealing outfit had. &quot;Not bad,&quot; 
Uzume admitted, &quot;though I don&#39;t know if I like the way this hinders my 
movements.&quot;

&quot;Looks good,&quot; Kaede smiled warmly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Uzume smiled back.

&quot;If you want something with freer movement,&quot; Chizuru led her back to the 
bathroom.

&#145;Wonder what they&#39;re up to this time?&#39; Kaede wondered.

&quot;I have a thing about disliking chains,&quot; Uzume was heard to grumble.

&quot;Oh my oh my,&quot; Chizuru chuckled to herself softly as she stepped out. 
&quot;Punk Uzume,&quot; she gestured grandly.

A ripped top barely hung on Uzume&#39;s shoulders and leather-style pants 
hung to her every curve. Instead of a belt a length of chain had been 
threaded through the belt loops, and cute clip on earrings of handcuffs 
hung on each ear.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Kaede blinked, &quot;where did you get that?&quot;

&quot;Natsumi is an actress,&quot; Chizuru explained, &quot;and she likes me to cosplay 
when we&#39;re...you know...&quot; She blushed prettily.

&quot;Huh, never would have guessed,&quot; Kaede blinked.

&quot;So, do you want to be my biker babe?&quot; Uzume offered, walking over to 
give Kaede a saucy little grin..

&quot;Gladly,&quot; Kaede conceded before adding, &quot;but you&#39;ll cause almost as much 
of a riot in that as your bikini.&quot;

&quot;Come on, then,&quot; Chizuru dragged Uzume away once again.

What followed was a adventure into the sort of things you can find in a 
actresses&#39; closet. The school girl swimsuit nearly gave Kaede a 
nosebleed, the office lady look was off the wall, and she had no idea 
where the dominatrix outfit came from.

Finally Uzume emerged in the last outfit and asked, &quot;How about this, 
then?&quot;

Getting up Kaede hugged Uzume, both of them wearing matching Mahora 
uniforms. &quot;I&#39;d say that&#39;s about right,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Awww,&quot; Chizuru pouted.

&quot;Let&#39;s go eat,&quot; Uzume laughed as she and Kaede left, &quot;I&#39;m starving.&quot;

End

Notes: No, there&#39;s nothing in the Negima manga or anime implying that 
Chizuru and Natsumi are a couple, I made it up. Lol A silly little fic 
with a cosplay theme just in time for Halloween. May or may not do a 
part three.</pre>
