<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>The squeaking of my wet raincoat filled the hallway as I went back and 
forth, making sure the girls were settled. Poor Reticia was almost 
swallowed up in my t-shirt, but I had nothing else for her to wear. 
Margaret fared somewhat better in nightclothes borrowed from her sister. 
I made sure they were showered and fed, then pulled out the sofa and 
tucked them both in. I stopped at the living room entrance and looked 
back.

&quot;Is it okay to turn off the light or do you need it on?&quot; I asked.

&quot;You can turn it off.&quot; Margaret yawned. Reticia was curled into a small 
ball and didn&#39;t even open her eyes.

&quot;Goodnight then.&quot; I switched off the light and went slowly back down the 
hallway, feeling the pain seeping throughout my body. My ankle, my lips, 
my face, all of me- I was in need of those painkillers. I went into the 
bathroom and quickly took two of them. Hearing the door, I went back out 
into the hallway.

&quot;There you are.&quot; I said softly as Madlax appeared. She gave me a tired 
smile. I opened my arms and pulled her to me, holding her as tightly as 
I could. She was soaked, and I felt the water dripping downward over my 
skin. We held onto each other, rocking together in a silent embrace of 
comfort.

&quot;I missed you. I missed you so much.&quot; My confession was whispered.

&quot;Then come wash away this night with me.&quot; she whispered back, and pulled 
me into the bathroom.



&quot;Are you cold?&quot; She asked gently, pulling the covers up over us. She 
wedged one leg comfortably in between mine, then put her other leg over 
me, entwining us together. Her naked body was smooth and muscular, and I 
ran my hands over her, enjoying the sensation.

&quot;No. The trembling will stop soon. It was just...intense.&quot; I had 
honestly never felt like that before in my life, and now my legs 
couldn&#39;t seem to stop shaking. &quot;You- you don&#39;t think they heard me, do 
you?&quot;

Her body shook against mine as she laughed. &quot;They don&#39;t have to hear you 
to know.&quot;

&quot;Oh... that.&quot; I sighed.

Madlax had tried to explain this weird thing about Margaret not really 
being her sister, but I was unable to fully comprehend what she said. 
&quot;Madlax, nothing&#39;s going to happen while we&#39;re in the middle of...you 
know.&quot; My hand slipped down her hip. &quot;I mean, I only want you- it would 
be embarrassing if suddenly you turned into-&quot; I was interrupted by her 
finger on my lips.

&quot;Shhh. Don&#39;t worry about that. I told you before, it only happens when 
you say those two little words.&quot; She kissed me into a silent submission.

&quot;Madlax...I think I have... three little words I want to say to you.&quot; I 
ventured out, suddenly feeling shy. Three little words, words I had not 
said since one night long ago when I had promised myself to marriage.

&quot;I would very much like to hear them.&quot; She put her hands to my face, 
staring intently into my eyes. &quot;Say those three words to me, Vanessa 
Renee.&quot;</pre>
