gun went flying and landed next to me.

&quot;Vanessa! Shoot!&quot; I heard the voice command me. I grabbed the gun and 
tried to hold it steady. Rimelda looked up at me and began to laugh.

&quot;How pathetic.&quot; Her disdain with me was evident. She jumped to her feet 
and I followed her gaze to see...Margaret.

&quot;Margaret! Be careful!&quot; I cried out. The young girl&#39;s face was dark with 
anger and she lunged at Rimelda. I crawled backwards quickly as I was 
almost kicked in the head. Margaret threw another kick and Rimelda 
dodged her, running out of the kitchen. Margaret gave me a look that 
reminded me of Madlax and then ran after Rimelda.

&quot;Margaret! No! Wait!&quot; I struggled to get up to my feet, still holding 
the gun. I heard the door slam into the wall as it was flung open. Using 
the countertop, I pulled myself up and limped down the hall as quickly 
as I could. The thunder rumbled loudly and the lights flashed again. I 
saw a small white ghostly figure and froze, dropping the gun.

&quot;Hurry. Hurry, Vanessa. If one dies, so does the other.&quot; The little girl 
said.

&quot;Reticia! What-&quot; I started, but she ran over to the coat closet and 
opened it.

&quot;Hurry. If Margaret dies, so will Madlax. Hurry, Vanessa. Please. We&#39;re 
in trouble.&quot; She begged. I ran over and grabbed a raincoat, and slid my 
boots over my bare feet.

&quot;The gun- take it.&quot; she handed it to me.

&quot;Where are they? Do you know?&quot; I was practically shaking her small 
shoulders, her ringlets of hair bobbing madly.

&quot;We&#39;re in the garage. Hurry!&quot; she looked up at me, tears in her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m going! I&#39;m going!&quot; I ran out the door.



The nearest parking garage was two blocks away. I ran through the storm, 
the torrential rain pummeling the air around me, making it hard to 
breathe. My ankle was throbbing in pain, keeping the pace with my sharp 
ragged breathing. No one was out in this storm; it was if I was in my 
own personal hell. I reached the garage entrance and ran down the rows 
of cars, wondering how I would find Margaret. The lightning flashed 
again, illuminating the floor in a white glow. I thought I saw a black 
jeep at the end of the row. I ran as fast as I could to get to it.

&quot;Madlax!&quot; I saw her body on the ground next to the jeep. Was I too late?

&quot;Oh please God- no.&quot; I fell to my knees next to her. She was holding her 
hands around her neck, her eyes wide.

&quot;Fourth floor.&quot; She gasped out, her face turning colors. &quot;Ri- Ri..&quot; she 
wheezed. I knew what she was trying to say and got back to my feet, 
looking for the stairs.

Hurry, Vanessa. I ran up the steps two at a time, ignoring the shooting 
pain with each leap. Reaching the fourth floor, I looked out cautiously 
from the door. Next to the elevator was Rimelda, leaning over Margaret. 
I could tell she was strangling her, her shoulders tight with effort. I 
pulled the gun out of my pocket, trembling. I took aim between her 
shoulders, steadying my finger. I could feel the panic in my chest. If I 
pulled the trigger, I was a murderer. And if I didn&#39;t.....

I&#39;m willing to kill for what I want.

I pulled the trigger.

My hand knocked back, and I saw Rimelda&#39;s head snap up as she was hit. 
Without a sound, she fell to her side, leaving Margaret uncovered. I 
dropped the gun and ran to Margaret, dragging her back to the staircase 
with me. I stroked the hair from her face, thinking of how different she 
looked without it braided. The color of her skin was returning to 
normal, and her eyelashes batted a few times as if she was coming 
around.

&quot;We&#39;re going to be okay now. All of us.&quot; I pulled her up into a hug. 
&quot;I&#39;m going to go check on your sister.&quot; I laid her back down gently on 
the pavement, stealing a look out into the garage to make sure Rimelda 
was not moving. It looked like she had moved a little. The sight of all 
the blood made me sick and I looked quickly away.

Margaret opened her eyes and looked solemnly at me. I gave her a 
reassuring smile.

&quot;Did you miss me?&quot; she whispered, her voice husky.

&quot;What? Miss you?&quot; I stammered, confused. She raised herself up and 
leaned forward, taking my face in her hands.

&quot;Ma- Margaret?&quot; I stammered out. The way she was looking at me...it was 
the same way Madlax looked at me. Something was terribly wrong here. I 
grabbed her hands from my face and shook them.

&quot;Margaret Burton! Snap out of it!&quot;

She gave me a quizzical look, then her eyes got wide, and the girlish 
shy smile I knew returned. She ducked her head down.

&quot;Um, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happening.&quot; She confessed, removing her hands 
from mine and folding them in her lap. I heard boots bounding up the 
steps and turned to see Madlax running up to us.

&quot;There you are.&quot; Her arms were around me, pulling me up, pulling me into 
to her. I let out a small sob of relief.

&quot;I shot someone. I had to, I had to do it...&quot; I choked out, holding onto 
her tightly.

&quot;You two go home. I will finish up here.&quot; She said quietly, gently 
disengaging my lock on her. &quot;Go on...I will be there as soon as I can.&quot;

I nodded and reached for Margaret&#39;s hand. Madlax looked at me for a 
moment, then traced her fingertip over my sore lip.

&quot;Your mouth, your beautiful mouth.&quot; her voice was full of sorrow. I 
caught her hand in mine.

&quot;Take care of your business. I&#39;ll be waiting for you, Madlax.&quot;</pre>
