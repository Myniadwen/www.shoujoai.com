<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>&quot;Why couldn&#39;t you just be some postal officer.&quot; I tossed yesterday&#39;s 
paper into the garbage can. I got up and closed my office door, trying 
to block out the everyday sounds of work.

Madlax had refused to elaborate any further on her latest assignment, 
other than to assure me she wasn&#39;t in immediate mortal danger. She&#39;d 
dressed in another suit, a beautiful blue one that made her look even 
lovelier than the day before.

&quot;Not trying to seduce someone, are you?&quot; I&#39;d asked, trying not to sound 
jealous. She had just laughed and then told me it was part of her 
assignment. I&#39;d not gotten an answer; and our ride to the office had 
been quiet, despite her teasing efforts to get me to talk.

I put my head in my hands, elbows on the desk. She was an agent- 
seduction, at some point, was probably required on the job. I&#39;d never 
thought about it- I was so worried that her life was at stake, I never 
thought about anything else.

I sighed. There wasn&#39;t anyone I could really talk to about this. No one 
knew about it, the whole truth, the real story- except ...Margaret. 
Margaret! It seemed silly to talk to the girl, but she seemed to know 
more about Madlax than me. I fished around in my purse, looking for her 
number. Grabbing the office phone, I quickly dialed out.

&quot;Hello?&quot; her shy voice brought a smile to my face.

&quot;Margaret. This is Vanessa. Am I disturbing you?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m at lunch now. I&#39;m glad you called. I miss you.&quot; Her honesty was 
disarming, and I felt myself slump in my chair. How could I have thought 
to interrogate the girl?

&quot;Well- I was just missing you too.&quot; I said quietly, resigning myself to 
not getting any peace of mind.

&quot;Something is bothering you.&quot; She said softly. &quot;Is it about the time 
before?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just...everything. Madlax. My parents.&quot; I hadn&#39;t called them, and 
dreaded the arrival of Saturday. I sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to 
be like this.&quot;

&quot;But this time is better than last time. Now you&#39;ve got Madlax back, and 
your parents are alive again. You shouldn&#39;t think-.&quot;

&quot;My parents! What are you saying about my parents?&quot; I cut her off, 
suddenly feeling anxious. I remembered Madlax picking up a family photo, 
and asking if my parents were alive.

&quot;What happened to my parents?&quot; I tried to keep my voice down. There was 
a silence on the other end, then I heard Margaret heave a large sigh.

&quot;Do you really want to know?&quot; she asked me.

&quot;Tell me. Tell me everything.&quot; I demanded.
