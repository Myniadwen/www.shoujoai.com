<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>She stepped forward, casually taking my other glass, helping herself to 
the wine. Her boots crunched the broken glass on the floor.

&quot;What a thoughtful hostess.&quot; her voice had a sound I didn&#39;t like, and I 
felt fear welling up inside of me.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; I tried to match the tone in her voice, but mine 
trembled as I spoke.

&quot;Amazing. You weren&#39;t worth killing before, and now you&#39;ve troubled me 
twice.&quot; She waved her other hand at me, and I saw a gun. I jumped 
backward quickly, stumbling along the counter. She followed me, sipping 
her wine, twirling her gun casually as it were a baton, not a weapon. My 
back was against the counter corner; unable to escape, I drew myself up 
and tried to stop shaking.

&quot;I killed you. You were dead. But somehow you&#39;ve come back, and ruined 
everything again.&quot; She placed the empty wine glass down on the counter 
with an air of disgust.

&quot;I would like to know how you did it.&quot; The gun stopped twirling and was 
now pointed at me. My mind went back to the conversation in my car. I 
remembered what the man had said: What I&#39;m saying is that you, being 
a..... a special interest of Madlax, should not expect any sort of help 
if you find yourself in trouble. Do you understand?

Help would not be coming. I was alone, I was unarmed, with nothing at my 
disposal except for...words. I made my living using words, my life was 
built around words. Think, Vanessa.

&quot;As if I would tell you.&quot; I honestly couldn&#39;t, so it was easy to look 
her in the eye. Her lip twitched and her eyes narrowed further.

&quot;You&#39;re going from annoying me to making me truly despise you.&quot; her 
voice was low, as if she was trying to control her temper. &quot;Before I 
kill you I want answers.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess you&#39;ll just have to ask me again next time.&quot; I said with 
all the bravado I could muster. I saw her face become puzzled and seized 
my opportunity.

&quot;You can&#39;t kill me. As you see, I just keep coming back. It&#39;s useless.&quot;

She shook her head in disbelief, but said nothing. I could see she was 
thinking.

&quot;But maybe next time you won&#39;t take Madlax from me.&quot; Her voice was edgy 
and unsure now. &quot;Next time- she won&#39;t find you.&quot;

&quot;You know that&#39;s not true.&quot; I countered gently. &quot;This is one you can&#39;t 
win, Rimelda.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she cried out, striking me across the face. I fell forward and she 
grabbed me, throwing me face first into the refrigerator. I hit the door 
and felt the blood fly from my mouth. She grabbed a handful of my hair, 
twisting it so I cried out.

&quot;How dare you pity me! You don&#39;t deserve her. Look at you. All weak 
and...and-&quot; she poked my sides with the gun &quot;and no muscle. No anything 
like me. Nothing like me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just it!&quot; I gasped out, pained tears stinging my eyes. &quot;She 
doesn&#39;t want someone like you! A killer who attacks people in their own 
homes!&quot;

She let go of my hair and turned my face with her hand, so she could 
look at me.

&quot;But you see, Madlax is a killer too. We&#39;re perfect for one another.&quot; 
She looked triumphantly at me.

&quot;No. You&#39;re wrong. Madlax may be a killer, but she&#39;s not cruel. Look at 
you. Look at what you&#39;ve done to me.&quot; The blood had a bitter iron taste 
in my mouth as I spoke, and dripped quietly off my chin. &quot;She doesn&#39;t 
have the heart to love cruelty.&quot;

Her mouth opened in surprise and she stepped back, letting go of me.

&quot;I... I&#39;m not cruel. I&#39;m willing to kill for what I want, which is more 
than I can say for you.&quot; She retorted with a defiant air.

I sank down to the floor, wiping my mouth with my robe. A large crack of 
thunder made us both jump and the lights flickered.

&quot;A nasty storm. I guess that will make her a little late coming home to 
find you.&quot; She arched her eyebrows.

&quot;Madlax is coming home tonight!&quot; I exclaimed, my chest tightening 
sharply so it was hard to breathe.

&quot;Shame you won&#39;t be alive to greet her. I&#39;m finished here.&quot; Rimelda 
pointed the gun down at me. &quot;Any last words? I&#39;ll be sure to relay them 
for you.&quot;

The building seemed to shake with another round of thunder, and there 
was a bright flash and then the lights went out again. I could feel the 
blood pounding loudly in my ears, almost in some sort of thundering 
chant. I could hear it, I could hear it go...

&quot;Elda Taluda.&quot; I said the strange chant out loud. Images flashed before 
me, and I felt dizzy. &quot;Elda...Taluda.&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; I heard her voice, then the lights came back on. I saw 
something move behind her, then a streak of long brown hair flying.

&quot;Madlax!&quot; I cried out.</pre>
