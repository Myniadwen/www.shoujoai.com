<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Zandra had helped me carry my bags to the door, but I could tell she 
didn&#39;t want to come in. Our trip together had been strained. I could 
feel her staring at me often, and the looks on her face as I freely 
spent in the kitchen store, buying Madlax new pots and utensils, almost 
made me laugh. Almost, but the look she had now was painful to see.

&quot;Well, thanks. I&#39;ll call you, okay?&quot; I said, putting the key in the 
door.

&quot;Yea. Sure.&quot; she looked down at the floor, obviously unhappy.

&quot;I &#150; I don&#39;t know what to say, Zandra. I didn&#39;t mean for this to 
happen.&quot; I pushed the door open, and turned back to face her in the 
hallway. &quot;It just happened.&quot;

&quot;That stuff you bought...she&#39;s really going to stay here with you, isn&#39;t 
she?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she is. She...likes to cook.&quot; I bit my lip, unable to think of 
anything else to say.

Zandra was staring at me, but it was hard to tell what she was feeling.

&quot;Please, say something.&quot; I blurted out, unable to take the tension any 
longer. If you hate me, tell me now....

&quot;Well then you&#39;d better learn to cover your neck! You&#39;ve got a huge love 
bite there!&quot; with that, she turned and ran down the hallway. When she 
reached the elevator, she spun about and put her hands on hips, glaring 
at me.

&quot;I can only imagine what your parents will say about this new twist in 
your life!&quot; she yelled as she got onto the elevator.

&quot;My parents...&quot; my hand went up to the sore spot on my neck. &quot;How will I 
explain all this to my parents?&quot; I ran my hand along the welt, feeling a 
mixture of shame and arousal at the same time.

&quot;I&#39;m crazy.&quot; I picked up my numerous bags and limped inside, dropping 
them by the door. The phone rang, and I ran as fast as my ankle would 
let me, huffing my way to the phone.

&quot;Hello!&quot; I barked out impatiently, hoping it was her.

&quot;Vanessa? This is Margaret. Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m fine. Just a little winded from running to the phone.&quot; I tried 
to force some cheer into my voice, to cover my disappointment.

&quot;I was wondering if you would like to come to my birthday party tomorrow 
afternoon.&quot; Margaret&#39;s voice seemed shy, so unlike her sister.

&quot;Oh- well that would be lovely.&quot; I sat down on the edge of the sofa, 
dangling my sore ankle off the floor. &quot;Thank you for asking. Do you want 
me to bring anything?&quot;

&quot;Just yourself. That would be the best present of all.&quot; Margaret&#39;s small 
voice brought a smile to my face. I really did like the girl. I heard 
Margaret clear her throat on the other end of the line.

&quot;You miss her, don&#39;t you?&quot; her voice was surprisingly gentle.

&quot;I do.&quot; I felt myself sliding off the edge, down into the cushions of 
the sofa. &quot;I really do.&quot;

&quot;She misses you too.&quot; her voice was soothing. I hooked my arm around a 
pillow, pulling it to my chest.

&quot;How do you know? Did you talk to her?&quot; I tried not to be jealous, but I 
could feel it in my chest.

&quot;Not on the phone. Not in words- I just know.&quot; Margaret&#39;s voice sounded 
almost sad.

&quot;She&#39;s safe?&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but ask, ignoring the tone in the poor 
girl&#39;s voice.

&quot;She&#39;s safe. Don&#39;t worry, Madlax will come back to you, Vanessa Renee.&quot; 
For a moment, she sounded like Madlax, and I felt my body curl up around 
the pillow.

&quot;Thank you, Margaret Burton.&quot; I sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Goodnight.&quot; She clicked off the phone. I lay still, 
clinging the phone and the pillow to me.

&quot;Goodnight.&quot; I whispered, wishing I could communicate with Madlax like 
Margaret did. &quot;Goodnight, Madlax.&quot;</pre>
