Tony&#39;s smile was very smug, and I resisted the urge to pinch him.

&quot;I told you I was a mess. I fell and hit my lip on the refrigerator 
door.&quot;

Tony shook his head. &quot;And your car? I suppose that fell too?&quot;

&quot;In the shop.&quot; I sighed. &quot;Again.&quot;

&quot;You know, you should just sub-let the space there.&quot; Tony winked at me.

&quot;Very funny. Now get out, I have work to do.&quot;



The normalcy of the office that I had craved so desperately a few days 
ago seemed like an eternal trap. Endless interruptions, phone calls, 
useless conversation. It had been hard to concentrate on my work when my 
thoughts were of her. I stared vacantly at my monitor, the text on it 
seeming to blur into one big line. My phone rang, jarring me back into 
focus.

&quot;This is Vanessa.&quot; I answered.

&quot;This is your lover.&quot; Her voice was soft and low on the other end of the 
line.

&quot;Madlax!&quot; I was both shocked and thrilled to hear her, to hear her speak 
to me in such a fashion. She was my lover; I just... I just wasn&#39;t used 
to this.

&quot;I&#39;m waiting outside for you.&quot; she hung up.

I leaned the chair back, amazed at the effect she had on me. I glanced 
at the clock and decided I could leave a few minutes early. I gathered 
my purse and briefcase, then rushed out to the elevator.

The eleven floors down seemed to take forever. I smiled at my own 
impatience, at my desire to see her. I hadn&#39;t felt this way....since 
Will. I shook my head and stepped out as the doors opened.

&quot;Need a ride?&quot; Tony&#39;s voice startled me.

&quot;Oh! Um, no. I have one.&quot; I couldn&#39;t hide the smile on my face, it was 
coming out again despite my best efforts.

&quot;I see.&quot; He squinted at me and then raised an eyebrow. &quot;I think I&#39;ll 
walk you to the door.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s really not necessary.&quot; I pushed past him. He fell into step with 
me, matching my hurried stride.

&quot;Oh, but I just have to see whose got you treading water.&quot; he smirked 
out.

&quot;Now look here, Tony, it&#39;s really not what you think.&quot; I stopped at the 
glass door as I saw Madlax outside.

&quot;I&#39;d say.&quot; Tony&#39;s voice was full of laughter. &quot;I thought it would be 
another gender.&quot;

&quot;Tony!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, your secret is safe with me.&quot; His eyes were crinkled with 
amusement. He pushed open the door for me.

&quot;Have fun swimming tonight.&quot; He winked at me. I could feel myself 
blushing as I went out the door.



&quot;What is it? Are you shocked to see me in a suit?&quot; she asked as I came 
up to her.

&quot;No. Well, yes, that too.&quot; I felt the blush turn into a heat that spread 
all over my body, making me tingle in certain places. She looked more 
mature in the suit, the grey skirt smoothly hugging her hips. She 
looked...sexy.

&quot;Tony just found out about us.&quot; I mumbled, still staring at her.

&quot;And did the world end?&quot; she gestured to me and I climbed into the jeep.

&quot;No... no.&quot; I fanned myself a little and unzippered the window down. She 
got back into the jeep and I watched her legs as she adjusted her skirt.

&quot;Why are you in that suit? You weren&#39;t wearing it this morning.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t own it this morning.&quot; she said evenly.

&quot;And that briefcase? Did you have some sort of important meeting?&quot; I 
asked, noting the leather case on the backseat. She seemed more like a 
lawyer than an agent today.

&quot;I&#39;d say. A critically important presentation.&quot; She glanced sideways at 
me and smiled.

&quot;I hope it went well.&quot; I stroked her arm, feeling the fine cloth of the 
suit under my hand.

&quot;It did- I got a most intriguing assignment from it. I just hope I can 
meet the challenge.&quot;</pre>
