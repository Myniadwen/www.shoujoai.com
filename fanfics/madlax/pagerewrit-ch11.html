<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>I sat in the car, panting, trying to catch my breath. It was all too 
much, it was all coming at me too fast. I cranked the old window down, 
letting in fresh air. I leaned over and opened the glove compartment, 
taking out my little yellow plastic turtle.

&quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; I sat the turtle on the dash. &quot;Will, how can 
this happen to me?&quot;

I turned and looked at the empty passenger seat next to me. It was in 
this very seat that Will had proposed to me. I had thought the course of 
my life was determined that night. I&#39;d had no doubts when I said yes. 
I&#39;d had no regrets, only excitement, when I&#39;d given up my virginity on 
the spot, reclined in that seat, feeling that my future was sealed. He 
didn&#39;t have a ring, but had given me the turtle until he could afford 
one. It didn&#39;t matter, I knew I had his heart.

&quot;But in the end, all I&#39;ve got is you.&quot; I picked up my turtle and put him 
back into the glove box. In the end, once the screaming and fighting had 
subsided, Will and his family had moved away. I sighed and leaned back 
in the seat, closing my eyes.

There was an odd sound, and I felt something hard press into my head. 
Sensing I was in danger, I froze in mid-breath.

&quot;So sorry to have to get your attention this way.&quot; A man&#39;s voice came 
from the back seat. &quot;But you seem to talk to yourself quite a bit.&quot; His 
voice didn&#39;t sound threatening, but I knew that hard object was a gun.

&quot;I hate to interrupt your train of thought, but I need to talk to you 
about Madlax.&quot;

----------

He refused to give me his name, saying only that Madlax worked for him. 
I&#39;d asked him to take away the gun, and he asked me if I was going to be 
reasonable. Not quite sure what he really meant, I agreed.

&quot;So she&#39;s not hurt then, she&#39;s safe.&quot; I didn&#39;t care what he had to say, 
I needed to know this before anything else.

&quot;Safe. And once she is done, she will return.&quot; he replied smoothly.

&quot;And how much longer is that, exactly?&quot; I thought myself brave to ask.

&quot;When she is done.&quot; he answered again. I realized that he wasn&#39;t going 
to offer me any more information, so I remained quiet.

&quot;First off, I would like to make it clear that I did not approve her 
actions in this matter. To do such a thing as she has done...I do not 
approve. But, seeing as you are now here- I will tell you a few things.&quot;

My mouth had dropped open in surprise, and he took my silence as his cue 
to continue.

&quot;She was late reporting for duty on her last mission. She&#39;s never been 
late before. She also appeared to be somewhat...flustered. Her mind was 
not on her assignment.&quot;

My hand went up to my neck, and I was glad for the darkness, so he 
couldn&#39;t see the red of my cheeks.

&quot;In her line of work, timing is of the essence. Any sort of breakdown is 
crucial and could potentially lead to injury or death. Do you 
understand?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I do.&quot; I felt a mixture of both guilt and anger welling up in me.

&quot;Then it won&#39;t happen again.&quot; This wasn&#39;t a question, so I didn&#39;t answer 
him.

&quot;Good.&quot; There was a small flash of light, and I realized he had lit a 
cigarette.

&quot;Mind rolling down the window if you&#39;re going to do that?&quot; My anger got 
the best of me, and I blurted it out before I could catch myself.

He rolled down the window and then sat back, a dark shadow with a small 
glowing button near his mouth.

&quot;One more thing.&quot; He exhaled slowly. &quot;Do you know how to use a gun?&quot;

&quot;Use one? I&#39;ve never touched a gun in my life.&quot; I frowned. &quot;I never had 
any reason to do such a thing.&quot;

&quot;Well you might want to learn.&quot; He drew a long drag and tossed the 
cigarette out of the window.

&quot;Agents make enemies. Madlax is no exception.&quot; He coughed slightly and 
went on. &quot;And it is not our policy to provide protection to the spouses 
or...special interests of our agents.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot; I thought I knew, and I could feel a chill come 
over me. I hadn&#39;t really thought about all this before, but I knew he 
was right.

&quot;What I&#39;m saying is that you, being a..... a special interest of Madlax, 
should not expect any sort of help if you find yourself in trouble. Do 
you understand?&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; I swallowed hard. &quot;I&#39;m in this alone.&quot;</pre>
