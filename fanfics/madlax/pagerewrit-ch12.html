<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The familiar sounds of the office had never been so comforting. Limping 
through the cubicles, listening to the inane chatter and clacking of 
keyboards, I felt some semblance of sanity. This is normal. These are 
normal people, doing normal things. I just want to be one of them. Being 
a &quot;special interest&quot; for Madlax was turning my life upside down. I&#39;d 
barely slept the night before,and my answering machine had some message 
from my mother, but I couldn&#39;t hear what it was, she was crying so hard.

Even though it was hard to concentrate, I relished the chance to work, 
answering e-mails, listening to my messages. Deleting them as I went, I 
finally got to the last one. Sunday night, eleven PM.

&quot;Strange.&quot; I muttered, and hit the button.

&quot;I miss you.&quot; Madlax&#39;s voice was unmistakable. &quot;Wait for me, Vanessa 
Renee.&quot;

I dropped the phone into my lap. In a rush, all the normalcy of the day 
disappeared. Shaking, I picked the phone up and placed it back onto the 
receiver, fighting the urge to listen to her voice again. I&#39;ll deal with 
all this later. I won&#39;t let her take over my thoughts now.

A knock at the door startled me and I tipped over the trashcan I was 
using to prop up my foot. Tony frowned and gave me a quizzical look as 
he came in the office.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? You seem kind of jumpy today. Is it those pain 
pills?&quot;

&quot;Oh, those- no, I&#39;m not even taking them. The ankle feels better.&quot; I 
ducked under my desk and propped my foot back up. He sat himself down on 
the end of my desk and scooted conspiratorially over to me.

&quot;I have to tell you. You- something&#39;s not right with you, Vanessa. It&#39;s 
like you&#39;re not yourself lately.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say 
it, really- just...you&#39;re different.&quot;

&quot;In a good way or bad way?&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to know, really.

&quot;Just a strange way. Is it- are you in some sort of trouble?&quot; his voice 
and face showed he was truly concerned for me, and suddenly I felt like 
crying. I looked at the phone, still blinking with the message from 
Madlax. I felt so alone in this, and I fought back the lump in my 
throat.

&quot;Tony, have you- have you ever felt like you&#39;ve gotten deep into 
something way over your head?&quot;

Tony sighed and ran his hands through his hair. &quot;Hell yeah. It was a 
nightmare.&quot;

&quot;What do you do, when that happens? What do you do, Tony?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s only two things you can do when you&#39;re in the deep end.&quot; He 
squared himself back up and looked at me. &quot;You can swim like hell and 
hope you make it, or get the hell out.&quot;

I put my hand up to my mouth. Walk away. Just walk away, pretend it 
never happened, and live a normal life.

Tony leaned over and rubbed the top of my head.

&quot;From the looks of you, I&#39;d say you need to get the hell out.&quot;</pre>
