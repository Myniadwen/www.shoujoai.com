<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Morning came too soon, and the annoying alarm was buzzing in my ear. 
Before I could react, Madlax reached an arm over me and hit the button, 
then curled her arm back around me. We&#39;d fallen asleep on top of the 
covers, in our clothes, while talking.

&quot;I really need a shower. I can&#39;t believe I went to bed smelling like 
smoke from that restaurant.&quot; I moved her arm and got up, stretching. She 
rolled back with a grunt and pulled the comforter over her body.

When I came back from my shower, she was still in bed. I wondered how 
much sleep she got when she was on one of her assignments. If all that 
stuff she said was true. I looked at her jacket on the floor, and saw 
the tip of her gun. Maybe it was true. She certainly didn&#39;t act like a 
criminal, or a crazy person.

I dressed as quietly as I could, glancing at the clock to make sure I 
was still on time for work.

&quot;Where are my clothes?&quot; she sat up, rubbing her eyes.

&quot;Top drawer, the dresser by the closet.&quot; I answered, taking a last 
glance myself in the mirror.

&quot;Thanks for putting them away for me.&quot;

I smiled, remembering how I&#39;d almost thrown them out the window after 
she had left.

&quot;I have to go. Are you going to stay here today?&quot; I sat down at the edge 
of the bed, putting on my shoes.

&quot;No. But I will be back in time to take you to dinner. Around seven, I 
think.&quot; she said, rolling onto her elbow to look at me. &quot;You said it&#39;s 
good for you to get out, so I&#39;m taking you out.&quot;

&quot;Um, thanks.&quot; I could feel myself blushing, so I kept my eyes on my 
shoes.

&quot;You do want to go, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Yes I do.&quot;

----------

Tony leaned in the doorway, rubbing his chin.

&quot;What&#39;s with you today? I must have talked to you six times and you just 
floated by me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing really.&quot;

Except that I&#39;ve got some young female special-agent killer living in my 
apartment, who I think I have a date with tonight, and I&#39;m some sort of 
re-incarnation or something like that. No, everything is just normal and 
fine.

&quot;Car problems?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Man trouble?&quot; he grinned.

&quot;I wish.&quot; Maybe that would have been simpler, than whatever this was. He 
came over to my desk and leaned down.

&quot;I could fix that man trouble problem for you.&quot; he offered, arching his 
eyebrows.

&quot;Thanks for the offer, but no thanks.&quot; I pushed a pencil at him, backing 
him away.

&quot;Well if you want to talk about it, I&#39;m here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Tony. But I think I can work this one out myself.&quot; And no one 
would believe me anyway....

----------

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this. This has to be some sort of dream. Ow.&quot; 
I pinched myself, and did it twice, all the while looking in the mirror. 
&quot;I hope this dress isn&#39;t too tight.&quot; I bent over, testing it. The 
doorbell rang, interrupting my self-scrutiny. I went to the door, trying 
to quell the nervousness in my stomach. &quot;She&#39;s an eighteen year old 
girl, for crying out loud, Vanessa Anne Renee, get a grip on reality 
here!&quot; I scolded myself. Feeling more calm, I proceeded to open the 
door.

&quot;Madlax!&quot; I exclaimed at the sight of her, wearing a low-cut white 
dress, with matching shoes. With a grin, she reached out an arm from 
behind her back, and handed me a small bouquet of white roses.

&quot;Trying to make it all match.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m impressed. You look wonderful.&quot; I said, taking the roses into 
the kitchen. &quot;Thank you very much.&quot; I placed them in a vase, and brought 
them out to the coffee table.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome very much. Are you ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Maybe we should take my car instead? I mean, the way we&#39;re 
dressed-&quot; she took my arm and escorted me out the door, shaking her 
head.

&quot;I think I&#39;d rather take the car that will get us there.&quot; she grinned.

&quot;What are you trying to say about my car?&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing you mechanic hasn&#39;t already told you.&quot;

&quot;Madlax!&quot;

----------

It was another gorgeous night out as we pulled into the lot, the jeep 
crackling over the gravel as she looked for a spot to park. I noticed 
her purse laying in the back, a little too large for her outfit.

&quot;Is your gun in there?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; she pulled up the parking brake. &quot;It&#39;s always around 
somewhere.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; I said, stepping out of the jeep. Something gave way under my 
shoe and I twisted to the ground, crying out as I felt a sharp pain 
shoot through my ankle. I fought back tears as I grabbed my left ankle, 
cursing.

&quot;What? What? On no...&quot; Madlax was beside me, her hands going to my ankle 
as well. Suddenly she scooped me up, and stuffed me back into the jeep. 
I couldn&#39;t say anything, the pain was so severe I just concentrated on 
trying to breathe normally, and not cry.

&quot;Hospital.&quot; she muttered, gravel flying as the jeep jerked backwards.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It will be okay.&quot; I hissed out from clenched teeth.

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly.&quot; she growled. I knew she was right, so I leaned back, 
and let her speed on in silence.

----------

I looked down at the green and white air cast on my ankle. &quot;This really 
doesn&#39;t go with my outfit.&quot; I held onto the rail as the parking garage 
elevator jerked upward. &quot;Ow&quot;.

&quot;Well at least it&#39;s just a sprain. Two weeks in that should help.&quot; The 
elevator came to stop with a lurch, and I grimaced again. The doors 
opened and she turned and scooped me up, smiling at my protests.

&quot;You&#39;re a stubborn girl, Madlax.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one who refused the crutches.&quot; she reminded me. I sighed. 
&quot;I guess I was a little difficult in there.&quot; I looked up at her face, so 
strong for someone her age. If it wasn&#39;t for her appearance I would have 
assumed her to be much older. Her eyes- it was her eyes. Eyes that had 
seen the loss of both parents. Eyes that were trained to use a gun to 
kill. She must not have had much pleasure in her life, and now instead 
of enjoying dinner, she was carting me around.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for ruining the evening, Madlax.&quot; I said softly, really 
meaning it. She stopped and looked down at me.

&quot;How could it be ruined? You&#39;re right here.&quot; she replied just as gently, 
and I could feel myself starting to blush as she looked down at me. Her 
intense look made my heart start to beat faster, and I could feel myself 
holding my breath. Suddenly her eyes widened, her body stiffened, and 
she looked up.

&quot;Rimelda.&quot; she said evenly, as if a guest had arrived. I followed her 
line of vision and gasped in surprise at the sight of a young woman who 
looked a lot like me, but dressed like Madlax, in the same military 
garb. She looked distressed, as if she were ready to cry.

&quot;So it&#39;s true.&quot; she said sadly, looking at me.

Madlax nodded. The girl stepped forward, clenching a fist. &quot;I don&#39;t 
understand. She&#39;s weak. Has no right to use a gun. She&#39;s a bother that 
wasn&#39;t worth killing before and here she is again-&quot;

&quot;You killed me?&quot; I blurted out, shocked.

&quot;She was aiming for me.&quot; Madlax said quietly.

&quot;And you got in the way. You were always in the way. Always....&quot; her 
head hung down, in defeat, and she choked out a sob.

&quot;We&#39;re going home now.&quot; Madlax said gently, walking past her, taking me 
to the jeep. Without speaking, she helped me in. I kept glancing back at 
that poor girl, feeling more sorry than afraid. Suddenly she looked up 
at me, eyes narrowed, and I felt a sudden pain in my side. I gasped out 
loud, grabbing my waistline.

Madlax gunned the jeep down the ramp. &quot;Your side hurts?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; I groaned, feeling the pain start to ease.

&quot;That&#39;s where you where shot.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it.&quot; I winced, but the pain was very real.

&quot;It happened. I watched you die, Vanessa Renee.&quot; her voice was so low, 
and full of pain, that I felt like crying for her.

The ride home was silent, quiet tears running down our faces.</pre>
