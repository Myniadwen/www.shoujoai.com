am I.&quot;

I heard Tony laugh and couldn&#39;t help smiling myself.

&quot;Vanessa, whatever you say. Just answer me- are you there alone?&quot; his 
voice had a teasing note to it, and I waited a moment before answering.

&quot;Not exactly.&quot; I replied, feeling Madlax&#39;s soft kisses on my shoulder.

&quot;Didn&#39;t get out of it, did you? Then just what exactly are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Treading water.&quot; I hung up the phone.



The teapot whistled loudly and I turned off the burner. I slowly poured 
two cups, watching the steam rise. I took the empty wine glass that 
Rimelda had put on the counter and threw it into the trash. I glanced at 
the refrigerator and saw the blood on the door. A shiver went down my 
spine. If Margaret hadn&#39;t shown up, I would not have survived. I got a 
paper towel and some bleach spray and began cleaning.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Her voice behind me made me jump. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you suffered 
like that.&quot;

&quot;I- didn&#39;t hear you come in.&quot; I threw the towel in the trash. &quot;So the 
girls are both at school?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re at school, whether or not they learn anything today is another 
question.&quot; She smiled and picked up a cup of the tea, sipping it. &quot;This 
is good.&quot;

&quot;So...do you have to go to work today?&quot; I picked up my cup, but it was 
still too hot for me to drink, so I sat it back down. I saw her cup 
placed down next to mine then her arms were around me, under my shirt, 
gently pulling me back into her.

&quot;I have big plans today.&quot; She nuzzled my ear with her lips.

&quot;Um, really.&quot; I breathed out, amazed at the effect she had on my body.

&quot;Yes, and they start with removing these cumbersome clothes.&quot; Her hands 
slid my shirt upwards, but I stopped her.

&quot;Not here. Not in the kitchen, please.&quot;

&quot;That nightmare is over.&quot; She scooped me up, and I let her carry me down 
the hallway. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be afraid anymore.&quot; She let me down 
gently onto the bed. I wrapped my legs around her, pulling her down on 
top of me.

&quot;Actually, there is one other nightmare that&#39;s not over.&quot; I murmured, 
feeling my shirt being lifted from my body.

&quot;Mmmm...what could be more frightening than last night?&quot; her mouth was 
softly grazing my neck. I took a sharp breath, partly from excitement, 
partly from what I had to say.

&quot;Meeting my parents?&quot;</pre>
