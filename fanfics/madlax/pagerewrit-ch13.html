<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Refreshed from my shower, I paced the living room gingerly, my robe 
swinging freely about me. Unable to concentrate, I&#39;d wound up working 
late. Then the car had died yet again, so I had taken a hot and 
uncomfortable bus ride home. The ride had taken my mind off things, 
briefly- but now, back in the apartment, with her clothes nestled next 
to mine, I couldn&#39;t ignore the situation any longer.

Walk away. I didn&#39;t ask to be resurrected, revived, or anything else. I 
deserved my normal life back. What had she been thinking? What if I had 
been able to marry Will, and have the children and life I had planned? 
Would she have so boldly come knocking at my door, claiming to love me? 
Expecting me to turn my life upside down for her?

&quot;You&#39;re a selfish girl, Madlax.&quot; I muttered, swatting the blinds. &quot;Did 
you ever once think about your actions? No wonder your boss didn&#39;t 
approve.&quot;

I jumped as the phone rang, then stared at it for second. What if it was 
her.....

&quot;Hello.&quot; I gulped out.

&quot;Vanessa?&quot; Margaret&#39;s voice on the other end sounded worried. &quot;I was 
just calling to check on you and see how you are feeling.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine. Look, I have company so I can&#39;t talk now.&quot; I lied, not 
wanting to hear anything else that could upset me. &quot;I really have to go. 
Goodbye.&quot; I hung up the phone with a tinge of guilt- after all, she was 
a nice girl, and this mess wasn&#39;t really her fault. But I didn&#39;t need 
any more of her revelations of my life before, to add to my misery.

----------

I poured the bottle slowly. Just one glass wouldn&#39;t hurt- I would just 
have a glass and go to bed. I wasn&#39;t going to worry about when she would 
come home.

&quot;When she&#39;s done.&quot; I took a sip. I thought I heard the door, and my 
heart did a sudden leap. But I have to get past this. She&#39;ll get past 
it. She&#39;s just a teenager, like I was with Will. She&#39;ll move on.

I took a deep breath and grabbed another glass. She was definitely 
coming down the hallway. A little drink for both of us, that will help.

As I turned with both hands full, I realized my robe was open. It&#39;s not 
like she hasn&#39;t seen me naked before. The thought made me blush a 
little, and I cursed myself as I felt my nipples harden with excitement.

&quot;Welcome back.&quot; My voice quivered, despite my efforts at composure.

I gasped at the figure in the doorway, dropping my glass and grabbing my 
side in pain.

&quot;Rimelda!&quot;</pre>
