surprise.

&quot;Sprained my stupid ankle in a pothole full of gravel. I&#39;ll be back in 
Monday, I&#39;m just missing today.&quot; I said.

&quot;Do you need anything while you&#39;re laid up?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ve got a friend helping me.&quot; I smiled at Madlax, who had just 
entered the bedroom wearing a towel, fresh out of the shower. &quot;And the 
painkillers are just lovely.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re something else, Vanessa.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea.&quot; I sighed, and laid the portable phone back down on 
the nightstand. Madlax went over to her dresser and commenced her 
morning rummaging.

&quot;I&#39;ll get you more ice in a minute.&quot; she called out from the corner of 
the bedroom. &quot;Sorry I can&#39;t stay with you today.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what drugs are for.&quot; I smiled.

&quot;I&#39;ve made some arrangements though- you won&#39;t be alone.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; I asked, feeling alarmed at the prospect of some strange agent 
in my home. Just then the doorbell rang, and Madlax sprinted down the 
hall to answer it.

&quot;This just will not do.&quot; I grunted, getting up and hopping down the 
hall, leaning every few hops into the wall for support. I heard a small 
gasp and looked up. There was a schoolgirl, in a plaid skirt, with 
pigtails on either side of her head, and eyes wide, staring at me.

She dropped her books and ran over to me.

&quot;Vanessa!&quot; she cried out, almost knocking me over with her embrace. I 
felt tears through my nightshirt, and hugged her back with one arm, 
bracing myself against the wall with the other. She seemed to be a very 
sweet girl, and obviously knew me.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; I reassured her. &quot;It&#39;s okay...&quot; I looked at Madlax, needing 
a name for this girl.

&quot;Margaret.&quot; Madlax looked pleased with herself, picking up the fallen 
books.

&quot;Um, Margaret. So pleased to meet you.&quot; I stroked the top of her head.

&quot;Margaret Burton.&quot; her voice was muffled into my chest. &quot;I missed you 
very much, Vanessa.&quot;

&quot;Burton?&quot; I asked. It never occurred to me that Madlax would have any 
brothers or sisters. I just assumed she had no other family. But here 
was a sister, hugging me.

Madlax came down the hall, engulfed us both in a big hug, and declared 
that she was leaving. Scooping me up unceremoniously, she carried me to 
the sofa and sat me down.

&quot;Behave.&quot; she admonished me, as I rolled my eyes at her. &quot;Study hard.&quot; 
she waved at her sister, and slammed the door.

I scooted back on the sofa, making room for Margaret. She sat down, 
looking somewhat shy. Although she resembled Madlax in some respects, 
she was not as tall, and definitely did not possess the brashness of her 
older sister.

&quot;I don&#39;t have classes till the afternoon on Fridays. And I wanted to see 
you.&quot; she shifted uncomfortably, as if needing to explain her presence, 
and embarrassed about her emotional outburst earlier.

&quot;Well I&#39;m glad.&quot; I said, and watched her smile return. &quot;So...you know 
me...from before?&quot; I asked, trying to get a pillow under my ankle. She 
got up and did it for me.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; she looked around the room, then crossed her legs and 
looked at me.

&quot;I knew you before Madlax.&quot;

&quot;Really! How?&quot; I was very curious as to all this, Madlax revealing very 
little to me about the time before.

&quot;You tutored me for school.&quot;

I laughed, as I could not imagine I ever had the patience for such a 
thing.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; she asked, looking a little hurt.

&quot;It&#39;s not you- it&#39;s me. I can&#39;t imagine I would be a good tutor. 
Besides, you look like a very smart girl and I&#39;m sure you do well in 
school.&quot; I added, trying to cheer her back up. &quot;So I met Madlax from 
teaching you?&quot; It sounded like a reasonable way to meet, and I tried to 
imagine our meeting. Maybe she came to check on her sister and I was 
there...

&quot;You went on a trip.&quot; she stared ahead, focused in the past. &quot;You went 
on a trip, away, and you met her there. She was your bodyguard.&quot;

&quot;My bodyguard! What on earth did I need one for?&quot; I asked, not sure if I 
wanted to hear any more.

&quot;You stole some data.&quot; she was so busy staring ahead, she missed my jaw 
dropping in disbelief. That I would do something so criminal!

&quot;She was assigned to protect you. She wanted to protect you...but...&quot;

&quot;But I was killed.&quot; I said softly, trying sort out all this new 
information in my mind. She jumped up, clenching her fists to her side.

&quot;It was an accident! It wasn&#39;t supposed to happen- we didn&#39;t mean for it 
to happen...&quot; the rest of her words were choked, and she started to cry. 
I gestured to her, and she practically flung herself onto my chest, 
sobbing. I wanted to cry too, but tried to remain composed, for her 
sake. I murmured to her softly, telling her it was okay, that everything 
was okay now, stroking her back until I realized that she&#39;d gone to 
sleep. I closed my eyes, seeking the same escape.

----------

I watched the rain pour down outside, then dully poured another glass of 
wine. It not only helped with my ankle pain, it helped blur all the 
emotions I was feeling.

&quot;An accident...&quot; I muttered, hearing Margaret&#39;s voice in my thoughts. So 
we had not even been friends- Madlax had been paid to be with me. I 
shuddered, remembering how Rimelda had said I was weak, and not worth 
killing. I must have been a terrible burden to Madlax back then- maybe 
that&#39;s why she spoke so little of it. I looked at my ankle, propped up 
on the coffee table, and sighed. &quot;Still a burden, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m damn good too. I take pride in my work.&quot; the way in which Madlax 
had said those words....

&quot;But you failed. With me, you failed. So am I just your second chance to 
prove something?&quot; I asked aloud to the storm, then drained the glass and 
lay back on the sofa. &quot;Am I &#150; nothing more than a mistake that has to be 
corrected?&quot;</pre>
