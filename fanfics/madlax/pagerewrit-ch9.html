<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Oh dear God, it&#39;s just as she said!&quot; a hysterical voice jolted me from 
my sleep. The phone tumbled off my chest and hit the floor as I jerked 
upward in surprise.

&quot;Mother!&quot; I blurted out, recognizing the figure above me. &quot;How did you 
get in here?&quot;

She turned and pointed back out the doorway. &quot;The same way anyone could 
have gotten in here- you left your front door wide open all night while 
you were laying here on the sofa getting drunk and carousing with that 
woman! How could you! Oh!&quot; she threw up her hands to her head, shaking 
it. &quot;How could you do this to us?&quot;

&quot;Mother! I&#39;m not drunk! I just fell asleep- ouch.&quot; I grimaced as I 
hastily got to my feet. &quot;I just fell asleep on the sofa!&quot;

&quot;And just where did she fall asleep then?&quot;

&quot;Mother- there&#39;s no one else here.&quot; I huffed a large breath through my 
mouth, trying to calm down. &quot;Just sit down and I&#39;ll tell you, okay?&quot;

&quot;Well, she&#39;s telling the truth. My reconnaissance revealed nothing. 
She&#39;s not harboring anyone, female or male, on the premises.&quot; My 
father&#39;s authorative voice rang out over the room. Mother gave a large 
sigh and sat down in the easy chair, fanning herself. Father came to her 
and put her hand on her shoulder as if to steady her, then looked at me 
sternly.

&quot;Now- please explain yourself.&quot; He commanded me, fully expecting my 
cooperation. A lifetime in the military had made him into an 
intimidating man. My anger was almost enough to quell my fear of my 
father. How dare they just burst in on me like this?

&quot;Well- I do have someone living with me.&quot; I started, not sure exactly 
what to say. &quot;We-&quot;

&quot;Female? Is it a she?&quot; Mother&#39;s voice hurriedly interrupted me.

&quot;Yes, she&#39;s a female.&quot; I nodded, trying to remain composed as I watched 
the look on their faces.

&quot;Oh God, there go the grandchildren!&quot; My mother sobbed. &quot;What about my 
grandchildren?&quot;

&quot;Mother! I can certainly still have children!&quot; I stammered out. &quot;It&#39;s 
not like I&#39;m suddenly infertile or-&quot;

&quot;Enough, both of you!&quot; my father thundered. We were all silent for a 
moment, then father cleared his throat.

&quot;I demand to meet the cause of all this mess. Where is she?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I blurted out, without thinking. Their mouths dropped 
open and I shook my head, trying to explain. &quot;I mean, she&#39;s on 
assignment.&quot;

They looked at each other, then back at me. Father looked ready to 
explode, the veins on his neck bulging.

&quot;Young lady, just what have you gotten yourself into?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I sat down, feeling overwhelmed. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well you have one week to know. I expect to see you, and the cause of 
all this mess, at our house next Saturday. And I expect some answers!&quot;</pre>
