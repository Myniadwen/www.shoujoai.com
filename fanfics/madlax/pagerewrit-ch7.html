<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The banging grew louder, coinciding with the painful pulsing in my head, 
as I slowly became conscious. Groggily I got up from the sofa, limped 
over to the door, and opened it.

&quot;Holy hell, what happened to you?&quot; a shocked voice asked. I squinted 
harder, realizing the voice belonged to my old college roommate, Zandra. 
A vague recollection of having something planned with her entered my 
mind, but the pain in my head prevented me from thinking much further. I 
turned and made my way unsteadily back to the sofa.

&quot;Vanessa?&quot; her voice was now concerned. &quot;Vanessa- what happened to you?&quot;

&quot;Everything.&quot; I sat down heavily, and put my sore ankle up on the table. 
I pulled my robe together as best I could, as I could feel her staring 
at me. She stood in front of me, hands on her hips. The smell of her 
perfume made me sick in my stomach, and I swallowed hard.

&quot;You look like shit. Where&#39;s the tie for your robe? Did you drop it?&quot; 
she looked down around her on the floor.

&quot;She took it.&quot; I said quietly, still trying to believe it myself. I had 
let her take the sash. I had let her...take everything. There was no 
going back, now.

&quot;She?&quot;

&quot;Madlax. The girl...the girl I had sex with last night.&quot;

&quot;What...what...&quot; Zandra backed up, reached for the chair behind her, and 
sat down with a thud. &quot;What did you just say?&quot;

&quot;Against that wall.&quot; I nodded my head slightly, as it hurt to turn it. I 
watched as her mouth dropped open. It was hard to tell which was bigger, 
her eyes or her mouth.

&quot;You- you&#39;re not lying, are you? Oh shit, Vanessa! How could you?&quot;

&quot;It just happened.&quot; I put a hand over my eyes, trying to squeeze the 
pain from my head.

&quot;What do you mean it just happened? Where did you meet this girl?&quot;

That was easy to answer, but so ludicrous that I couldn&#39;t help but start 
to laugh quietly, still holding my head.

&quot;On the street.&quot; I didn&#39;t have to look, her gasp told me everything. She 
jumped up out of the chair.

&quot;You had sex with some girl you met on the street and you think it&#39;s 
funny? Vanessa Anne Renee, what has come over you? Have you any idea 
what this sounds like?&quot; she was pacing now, and suddenly leaned over the 
coffee table, grabbing the empty wine bottle. &quot;You were drunk weren&#39;t 
you? I mean, you&#39;re hungover now- you were drunk, weren&#39;t you?&quot; she 
waved the bottle at me.

&quot;Pretty drunk. I drank that whole bottle.&quot; I admitted with a groan, 
wishing my head could fall off.

&quot;That&#39;s it then. You were drunk, and she took advantage of you being 
such a nice person. There. It won&#39;t happen again.&quot; she slammed the 
bottle down with authority.

&quot;I feel awful.&quot; I really did, my head was one pulsing point of pain.

&quot;Well you should- really now, I&#39;ve known you for six years and you&#39;ve 
never done anything so crazy! Now go get in the shower and I&#39;ll make you 
something for that hangover. God, I hope she didn&#39;t have some sort of 
horrible disease!&quot; she called out, making her way toward the kitchen. 
With a huge groan, I got up and made my way to the bathroom.

----------

&quot;Slut puppy.&quot; Zandra sat on the edge of the bed, watching me grimace as 
I dressed.

&quot;Zandra- it&#39;s not like that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s lesbian slut puppy.&quot;

&quot;Zandra!&quot;

&quot;But you did, didn&#39;t you? Have a one-night stand with some street 
person?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not some street person. She&#39;s living here with me.&quot; I pulled my 
pants over my air cast with a final tug.

&quot;Oh my god.&quot; Zandra whispered at this revelation. Then her eyes widened 
as she looked down at the bed. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; she cried out, jumping up 
and frantically brushing herself off.

&quot;Zandra- I- we-&quot; I didn&#39;t know how to explain anything. I watched her 
put her hands over her ears and violently shake her head.

&quot;No! I don&#39;t want to hear any more. Last weekend you were a normal 
person and this weekend I don&#39;t know who you are!&quot;

&quot;Neither do I, really.&quot; I muttered, putting on my shoes. She dropped her 
hands and looked at me with pleading eyes.

&quot;Please Vanessa, I can&#39;t hear any more of this- let&#39;s just go shopping 
like we&#39;re supposed to do, okay?&quot;

I smiled and nodded, but her smile back was strained. I sighed. What the 
hell was I doing? She was right- a week ago, I was normal. And now....

&quot;Madlax.&quot; I whispered as I went to get my purse. &quot;What have you done to 
my life?&quot;</pre>
