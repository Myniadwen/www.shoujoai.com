<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>I felt excited and nervous as I pulled onto our street. I could see that 
mother was in the garden, leaning over, pulling the hose behind her. I 
pulled the car up into the driveway. She turned and looked at me, then 
dropped the hose.

&quot;Colonel! Colonel!&quot; she called out for my father. The door to the house 
flung open and my father ran out, his pipe hanging from his hand.

&quot;What the-&quot; he stopped as he saw us. I waved meekly, unsure of what to 
do next. Should I get out of the car and hold hands with Madlax? Not 
hold hands? I heard the car door slam and saw that Madlax was walking 
toward them. My father tapped his pipe out on the porch railing and 
walked down the steps towards Madlax. I held my breath.

&quot;Mission accomplished, sir.&quot; Madlax saluted him.

&quot;What?&quot; I got out of the car, thoroughly confused. Instead of tension 
and yelling, my father was standing there, tucking his pipe into his 
pocket with a smile.

&quot;Good job, soldier.&quot; He extended his hand to Madlax. &quot;Welcome to the 
family.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute! What&#39;s going on here!&quot; I ran up to them.

&quot;And were my assumptions correct?&quot; my mother leaned over to Madlax and 
pointed her finger at me.

&quot;Absolutely on target, madam.&quot; Madlax said politely.

&quot;Ahah! I knew it! I knew it all along!&quot; my mother straightened up 
triumphantly. I stood there in shock, as they all grinned at me in a 
conspiratorial fashion.

&quot;Knew what? Just what is going on here?&quot; I had my hands on my hips.

&quot;That you lost your virginity to Williston in that old car.&quot; Madlax said 
calmly, as if it were nothing more than a weather observation. I 
staggered back, hand over my mouth.

&quot;And that you refused to ever move on after that, dear. You would never 
let it go. You kept that car, and Will, like a chain around your neck.&quot; 
My mother stepped forward, her hands out to me. &quot;We never thought 
anything would be able to break it.&quot;

&quot;Until this bold youngster came along yesterday and took a challenge 
from me that I was sure would never be met.&quot; My father nodded his head 
at Madlax.

Stunned, I let my mother lead me towards the house. So the suits, the 
new car- it was for me, for my family. I could hear my father talking to 
Madlax behind me.

&quot;Speechless for once, Vanessa dear?&quot; my mother teased. &quot;I have to say, 
I&#39;m most impressed with this young lady- even if she is female.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; I was still in shock.

&quot;But I still want those grandchildren.&quot; She raised her voice. I felt 
Madlax&#39;s arms go around my waist.

&quot;You&#39;ll get them. I can&#39;t promise overnight delivery like I did with the 
car- can you wait nine months?&quot; she patted my belly with her hands.

&quot;Madlax!&quot;</pre>
