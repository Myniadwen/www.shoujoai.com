<pre>I slammed the phone down in disgust, and sighed. Glancing at my watch, I 
decided I&#39;d better leave now if I was going to get the bus. I looked 
around to see if I really wanted to take any work home, or just forget 
it for the evening. Deciding I needed a break, I gathered only my purse, 
and headed out my office door.

&quot;Still no go with your car, Vanessa?&quot; Tony asked from behind me, making 
me jump.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; I asked, trying to be civil, when I really just felt 
like beating someone.

&quot;Your face.&quot; he smiled. &quot;You look ready to kill someone.&quot;

&quot;Well I just don&#39;t understand how it can take all day just to look at 
it- now they have to order parts, and it&#39;s old so they will be hard to 
find, or so he says- this will be a fortune.&quot; I growled out, continuing 
my walk to the elevator.

&quot;Maybe you need a new car?&quot; he punched the button for me, before I could 
reach it.

&quot;Tell the boss to give me a raise so I can afford one.&quot; I snapped out, 
going into the elevator. Tony stuck his head through the door for a 
moment, that goofy smile still on his face.

&quot;You know I&#39;d give you a ride if Spotty didn&#39;t have to go to the vet 
today.&quot;

&quot;I know- thanks anyway!&quot; I shouted to him as the doors closed.

----------

I walked out onto the street, exhaling deeply into the spring air. 
Spotting a bus coming my way, I started to sprint across the street, 
when I heard my name called. As I turned around, I heard the shriek of 
car brakes and people scream.

&quot;What the hell.&quot; I muttered, running back to where people had gathered.

&quot;That girl was hit!&quot;

&quot;Did you see it?&quot;

I elbowed my way through, curious. There on all fours was a young woman, 
her head bent down to the pavement, blood dripping from her face. 
Dressed in a military jacket and sturdy boots, she looked like a member 
of some rock band.

The driver got out, panicking, and was calling for help on the cell 
phone. I kneeled next to the girl, putting my hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Are you okay-can you hear me?&quot; I called out loudly to her. She turned 
her body slowly, and brought up her head to look at me. Blood spilled 
out from a cut above her eye. Peering at me from one eye, she broke into 
a dazed grin, and to my amazement, suddenly embraced me, burying her 
head into my chest.

&quot;Vanessa Renee. I found you.&quot; her voice sounded like she was crying. &quot;I 
found you.&quot;

----------

&quot;She may have taken a hit on the head.&quot; I told the officer, as I watched 
the medics patch up the girls face. &quot;I think she thinks I&#39;m someone 
else.&quot;

&quot;Well, she&#39;s refused to go to the hospital, and she&#39;s not a minor, so 
there&#39;s nothing more we can do here.&quot; he said, snapping shut his 
notebook. &quot;I would suggest you be the one to drive home, and just watch 
her for tonight.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; I asked, wondering why I had any responsibility in this.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t she live with you?&quot; he asked, scratching his head.

&quot;Pardon me?&quot; I stammered. Live with me? The girl obviously had a 
concussion, poor thing.

&quot;I asked her where her home was, and she said with you.&quot; he looked 
confused. &quot;But you two can sort that out- I&#39;ve got another call.&quot; he 
turned, talking into his two-way. &quot;Roger.&quot; He turned back and waved at 
me, obviously through with the situation.

I stood there, mouth open for a moment, until a tap on my shoulder got 
my attention.

&quot;Here.&quot; the medic shoved a sheaf of papers at me, and a set of car keys. 
&quot;This is your stuff. Don&#39;t let her take any painkillers or aspirin 
tonight, and wake her up occasionally to check her. Got it?&quot;

Taking my stunned silence for an affirmative, he strode back to his 
vehicle, slammed the door, and pulled off slowly, revealing the girl 
sitting on the curb, still holding her head. I looked down at the 
papers.

&quot;Madlax.&quot; An unusual name, I know I would have remembered meeting her 
before...but still it sounded familiar. &quot;Madlax Burton, age eighteen.&quot;

&quot;Almost nineteen.&quot; a voice said, and I turned to see her standing next 
to me, a sad expression on her face. She was every bit as tall as I am, 
and her long legs were muscular, as if she played some sort of sport.

&quot;I can drive.&quot; she reached for the keys, but I clamped my hand shut. She 
took my hand for moment, but I refused to let the keys go, so she 
dropped my hand and smiled at me.

&quot;Still so stubborn, Vanessa Renee.&quot; There was something in the way she 
said my name, that made me feel as if I did know her. I shook my head.

&quot;Look, they said you can&#39;t drive. So I will take you home.&quot;

&quot;The jeep is over there.&quot; she pointed, and we walked in silence. Her 
gait was a little unsteady, so I took her arm, and she leaned lightly 
into me. The silence was comfortable, but my mind had questions. The 
problem was, in her condition, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to get any 
sort of reasonable answer.

We reached a black jeep, and she nodded when I looked at her to make 
sure we were at the right car. We got in, and she sighed, leaned back 
and closed her eyes.

&quot;So- Madlax- where do you live?&quot; I asked, turning the key in the 
ignition.

&quot;With you.&quot; she answered softly, without opening her eyes.

I leaned forward, putting my head on the steering wheel in frustration, 
and looked down at the blood and tears that had stained my shirt. I was 
without my car, I had missed the bus, my blouse was ruined. And why this 
young woman seemed so attached to me, I had no idea.

&quot;You don&#39;t remember me.&quot; her voice was so full of sadness, that I felt 
somehow guilty.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t remember meeting you before.&quot; I sat up and looked at 
her. The way she looked at me, with such intense sorrow, made me want to 
take her in my arms and comfort her. Resisting the urge, I instead dug 
my cell phone out of my purse.

&quot;Look- why don&#39;t you call your family and tell them to come pick you up 
at my place. We can go there for a bit and I&#39;ll clean up.&quot; Plus, since I 
didn&#39;t have a car, the jeep would come in handy for getting home.

She smiled and nodded, but waved away my phone, taking her own out of 
her pocket. I pulled away and started home, but couldn&#39;t help 
overhearing her conversation.

&quot;Hey it&#39;s me. I found her. We&#39;re going home. But....&quot; she sighed, 
tracing a pattern on the window. &quot;She doesn&#39;t know who I am at all.&quot;

She fell silent for some time, occasionally nodding her head, or 
murmuring an affirmative as she listened. Then she let out a big sigh. 
&quot;I know- I guess you&#39;re right. I will. I will. Bye.&quot;

&quot;Madlax.&quot; I was unable to stand not knowing what is going on for another 
minute. &quot;How do you know me? Did I lecture at your school? Or maybe I 
interviewed your parents.&quot; I mused, trying to remember a situation where 
we could have met.

She gave a little snort of amusement, but did not answer me, and I could 
tell she was trying to think of a response. Finally she sighed, closed 
her eyes and leaned back. She seemed tired and I felt bad for pushing 
her for answers.

&quot;I will tell you later, after dinner.&quot; she said, and turned to the 
window.

----------

Refreshed from my shower and in clean clothes again, I went to check on 
my unusual charge, who had been sleeping on the sofa ever since we got 
home. I rolled my eyes upon seeing she had not taken off her boots, and 
went over to her. I took each foot and gently unlaced her boots and took 
them off, trying not to wake her.

&quot;I missed you.&quot; she whispered, causing me to drop the boot to the floor 
in surprise. It made a lump in my throat to hear it, the way she said 
it. I went and sat on the coffee table next to her, staring at her.

&quot;How do I know you?&quot; I asked myself as much as her, surprised by a mix 
of feelings swirling through me.

&quot;Have you ever been to Ga-&quot; she caught herself, shook her head, and 
tried again. &quot;Have you ever been to Sonika?&quot;

&quot;Why would anyone go there? The economy is terrible, and there aren&#39;t 
any tourist attractions, really.&quot; I frowned. &quot;Why would I go there?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a very boring place.&quot; she closed her eyes and smiled 
as if remembering something.

&quot;Why, where you born there? My apologies, I didn&#39;t mean to insult you.&quot; 
I said.

She sat up, looking around the room. Gently she took up a family picture 
from the end table. She studied it for a moment.

&quot;Your parents?&quot;

I nodded.

&quot;They are alive?&quot; she asked cautiously.

&quot;They&#39;re on holiday in Rome. What has this got to do with you?&quot; I asked, 
feeling impatient.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for you.&quot; she put the picture down as if it were gold, 
then got up and headed for the kitchen.

I looked at the picture for a moment, wondering why my parents would 
matter to her, then got up and followed the sounds in the kitchen. She 
was busily chopping tomatoes on the cutting board. More vegetables were 
laid out to follow the same fate, and a box of angel hair pasta sat on 
the counter.

&quot;Making dinner?&quot; I asked, amazed at how she just made herself at home.

&quot;I&#39;m a better cook than you.&quot; she said nonchalantly, scooping them into 
a bowl.

&quot;What!&quot; I exclaimed, unable to believe the nerve of her to say such a 
thing. She paused for a moment, as if in thought. &quot;Of course, that could 
have changed too.&quot;

&quot;Young lady, where are your parents?&quot; my hands were on my hips. I was 
going to speak to them about raising such an ill-mannered girl, and ask 
that they retrieve her immediately.

&quot;Dead.&quot; she cut sharply into the mushrooms so the knife hit the board 
hard. &quot;My life hasn&#39;t changed much.&quot;

&quot;Oh...I&#39;m sorry.&quot; the anger left me as quickly as it came. &quot;Both- both 
parents?&quot;

&quot;Both. Mother was killed in an accident and father was....&quot; her voice 
trailed off to a whisper. &quot;Father was murdered.&quot;

&quot;Murdered!&quot; I exclaimed in shock. &quot;Oh Madlax, how horrible.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it was.&quot; she said softly, and I couldn&#39;t help but go up behind her 
and circle my arms around her. We stayed that way for a moment, and I 
became aware of her breathing, synching to the rhythm of mine. A sense 
of peace settled over me and the trauma of the day seemed to fade away.

&quot;Will you hang up my jacket for me?&quot; she asked quietly. I nodded my 
head, knowing somehow that this meant she would stay. And for some 
reason, I wanted her to.</pre>
