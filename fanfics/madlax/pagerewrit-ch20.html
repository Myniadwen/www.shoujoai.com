<a href="../madlax/pagerewrit-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>It had been torture the rest of the afternoon. Finally the clock struck 
our appointed hour and I went downstairs to meet Madlax. I had one goal 
in mind: as soon as I got home, I was going to call my family. Somehow, 
some way, we had to work this out. Now Saturday seemed too far away- I 
wanted to see them alive, to hear them, no matter how angry they were 
with me.

She was there waiting for me, but the jeep was gone. Instead she leaned 
against a sleek chrome convertible. Her assignment was certainly taking 
on new appearances. She looked sensually daring, raising her sunglasses 
and giving me a wink.

&quot;Care for a ride?&quot; she asked.

&quot;What&#39;s this? Part of your assignment?&quot; I ran my hand along the car. It 
seemed to be brand new.

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; she smiled and opened the driver&#39;s door. &quot;Go on, you 
can try it.&quot; She handed me the keys with a flourish.

&quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t- this is really- oh!&quot; I was pushed into the driver&#39;s 
seat with a laugh and she ran around to the other side and let herself 
in.

&quot;Vanessa Renee, don&#39;t start with excuses. When was the last time you 
drove a new car?&quot;

I started the car up, and it gave a perky growl.

&quot;Never. The only car I&#39;ve ever had is the one I have now.&quot; I pulled away 
from the curb, surprised at how easily the car handled. It zipped down 
the street with ease.

&quot;Then it&#39;s about time you got a new one, and let the old one go.&quot;

&quot;But I love that car! I&#39;ve had it forever!&quot; I exclaimed.

&quot;That old car is broken, Vanessa. Its time has passed. Let it go.&quot;

I looked at her, and she gestured for me to pull over. I did so, looking 
at her warily.

&quot;What is going on?&quot;

&quot;This is your new car. I had the old one towed away.&quot; She looked at me, 
waiting for my response.

I lost my breath. Gone....I felt a great pain in my heart. I wanted to 
cry, and part of me wanted to hit her, to hurt her for hurting me.

&quot;How...how could you?&quot;

She reached inside the glove compartment and pulled out...the yellow 
turtle.

&quot;Were you missing this?&quot; she said softly, handing it to me.

&quot;Yes.&quot; I choked out, trying not to cry.

&quot;One little turtle by itself is very lonely.&quot; She leaned over and 
embraced me. I let the tears go, feeling her hands stroking my hair. She 
moved again and I felt something touch my other hand. She pulled away.

&quot;Look. No more lonely.&quot; she whispered.

In my other hand was a little green turtle, shining and new. She put my 
hands together, taking them in hers.

&quot;Do you think we can start new now, Vanessa Renee? Tell me yes.&quot;

I nodded my head, too choked up to speak.

I let her take the pair of turtles from me, and watched her place them 
carefully back into the glove compartment. She looked up and gave her 
usual strong quiet smile.

&quot;So where would you like to take your new car this evening?&quot;

&quot;Home.&quot; The phone call from earlier in the day came flooding back. &quot;I 
must call my parents.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t we just drive over and see them now?&quot; she suggested, leaning 
over and wiping my eyes with the sleeve of her suit. &quot;You said they 
wanted to meet me.&quot;

&quot;Really? Well...I guess we could.&quot; Whatever was going to happen, would 
happen. And I was desperate to see them, no matter what the 
circumstances.

&quot;They would love to see the car, if nothing else. They&#39;ve been badgering 
me for ages to get a new one.&quot; I started the car again.

&quot;How far a drive is it?&quot; Madlax kicked off her heels and leaned back in 
the seat.

&quot;About forty minutes. Long enough for you to take a nap, if you&#39;re 
tired.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not tired. I want you to talk to me.&quot; She put her hands behind 
her head.

&quot;About what?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Williston Vreinhager.&quot;</pre>
