<h1>Part of Me</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/starofheaven.html">Star of Heaven</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A/N:  This was written for the yuri_challenge community on LiveJournal, 
and the prompt was &quot;weight.&quot;  Enjoy!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      &quot;Are they heavy?&quot; 

      It was an odd question to ask, especially right after sex when 
they were still naked.  But it was a question that was on Ryoko&#39;s mind 
quite often, and since Kureha&#39;s quick movements in bed reminded her of 
Kureha&#39;s agility with her weapons, Ryoko figured this would be the best 
time to ask. 

      &quot;What?&quot; Kureha replied, propping herself up on her elbows.  Her 
pale, lithe body was in full view, and although Ryoko saw it often, she 
didn&#39;t like to have her eyes anywhere else. 

      &quot;Your weapons, I mean,&quot; Ryoko clarified, bringing her eyes up to 
Kureha&#39;s face.  &quot;Are your weapons heavy?&quot; 

      Kureha laughed; that sweet, unusual laugh of hers.  She was 
definitely quirky, but it was a nice compliment to Ryoko&#39;s serious 
nature.  &quot;Not really,&quot; the blonde woman answered.  &quot;They&#39;re like a part 
of myself, like my arms or legs.  They came from within, so they feel 
natural in my hands.&quot; 

      &quot;Huh,&quot; was Ryoko&#39;s reply.  &quot;No wonder you can swing them around 
with ease.&quot; 

      &quot;You make me sound careless,&quot; Kureha said, laughing again.  She 
reached over and cupped one of Ryoko&#39;s breasts.  &quot;Your breasts are 
definitely heavier.&quot; 

      &quot;They&#39;re not that big.&quot; 

      &quot;That doesn&#39;t make them any less nice.&quot; 

      Ryoko smiled; she didn&#39;t smile as much as Kureha, but that didn&#39;t 
mean she was a complete killjoy all the time, but usually only Kureha 
saw that part of her.  Kureha&#39;s hand tightened and she moved so that she 
was on top of Ryoko.  As Ryoko wrapped her arms around Kureha&#39;s slender 
back, their lips met. 

      They were separate entities, but Ryoko couldn&#39;t imagine her life 
without Kureha being a part of it.</pre>
