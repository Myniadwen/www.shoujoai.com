<h1>The Trouble with Understanding (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff10/troubunder-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Tyhlan sung a jaunty tune as she and Elma performed drills. Her Al Bhed 
threaded in with her Spiran, and she stumbled over the words for a 
moment before flowing back into the mainlander&#39;s language. Elma bit the 
fingernail of her ring finger, trying not to think. She asked Tyhlan 
questions about Al Bhed as she tried to figure out a way to get away 
from the main camp, to find Reia. It was a little chilly today; Djose, 
and the area surrounding it, were not often as warm as the islands of 
Besaid and Kilika, and Elma shivered, tugging on her sleeves and moving 
closer to Tyhlan for warmth. She was unused to the odd weather in Djose. 
Occasionally, there were thunderstorms, and Elma glanced up at the dark, 
thick gray clouds overhead. It would rain today. Tyhlan seemed a bit 
more comfortable with the weather, but not much. She bit down hard on 
her bottom lip to keep her teeth from chattering. Save for Tyhlan&#39;s odd, 
disjointed, lyrics threading throughout the air, it was mostly silent. 
Elma frowned, and started to ask questions, unused to the quiet.

&quot;How do you say, &#39;hello&#39; again?&quot;

&quot;Rammu.&quot; The blonde girl responded. &quot;Though, we usually say, Knaadehkc, 
which means, &#39;Greetings.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Oh, and, what about...&quot; she thought for a moment. &quot;How would you say my 
name?&quot;

&quot;Amsy,&quot; Tyhlan said. &quot;Anything else?&quot;

&quot;Thank you is, &#39;Dryhg oui,&#39; right?&quot;

&quot;Oac.&quot; Tyhlan chirped.

&quot;That&#39;s &#39;yes,&#39;&quot; Elma said, without missing a beat. &quot;Wow! I&#39;m learning, 
huh?&quot;

&quot;You are,&quot; Tyhlan agreed warmly. &quot;Your accent is really nice. I bet 
you&#39;ll be a pro within a year.&quot;

&quot;E ruba cu, so vneaht,&quot; Elma responded.

&quot;A little formal...but that can&#39;t be helped for now,&quot; Tyhlan muttered, 
flipping her sword around. It slipped out of her hands, and she hissed a 
sharp curse in Al Bhed before picking it up again. &quot;You&#39;re getting 
really good though. Wow...I haven&#39;t been able to have a conversation in 
Al Bhed since mom...I can&#39;t wait until you&#39;re fluent. Spiran was hard to 
learn. I was lucky though. Most Al Bhed don&#39;t know Spiran at all.&quot;

&quot;Where are the Al Bhed?&quot; Elma asked. &quot;They don&#39;t travel mainland much. I 
never see any of them.&quot;

&quot;Ahh...can&#39;t tell you that, sorry. It&#39;s a secret,&quot; Tyhlan muttered. 
&quot;Vydran Cid...he wouldn&#39;t be happy if a Spiran found out where we 
were...no offense. I wonder how Vydran&#39;c daughter is doing. She was just 
a baby when I saw her last.&quot;

&quot;None taken,&quot; Elma responded. &quot;Vydran? Father? Is that the leader of the 
Al Bhed?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the leader. He&#39;s really gruff, but he&#39;s a nice guy. 
If...mother and I hadn&#39;t traveled so far up mainland, we would have been 
able to return Home, but we were too far off. He would have taken care 
of us...but mom, she thought that Yevon...&quot; Tyhlan trailed off and shook 
her head. &quot;But if we had been with Vydran Cid, I wouldn&#39;t have met you, 
huh?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Elma agreed. &quot;Hey, what about your name?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh...it means &#39;dancer.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Elma bit her lip, raked her fingers through her hair. A sharp 
wind blew past them, and Elma imagined she heard a thunderclap in the 
distance. She shivered. It was time to go. &quot;Tyhlan? Can you cover for 
me?&quot;

&quot;Cover?&quot;

&quot;Yeah! I um, I have to go somewhere! I&#39;ll be back in...five minutes, not 
even that!&quot;

Tyhlan frowned, crossing her arms in front of her chest. &quot;You sure have 
been acting weird lately...geez, you know, you&#39;re weird all the 
time...but, okay, I guess. If I get in trouble though...&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Elma finished dryly, already trotting away from the training 
area. &quot;I owe you one!&quot;

--------------

The Girl was looking for her.

She called her the Girl because that&#39;s what everyone else called her, so 
why shouldn&#39;t she? &#39;That Girl is pretty good with a sword, I heard the 
Girl is doing well in Captain Lucil&#39;s ranks...and who does well with 
Lucil? She&#39;s tough.&#39; The Girl had given her a name, sounded a bit like 
the name of a tree. Willow, was it? Did it matter? She hadn&#39;t watched 
the sphere, which was probably why the kid was lurking around, searching 
for her. She didn&#39;t tell secrets and she wasn&#39;t nosy; she&#39;d tell the 
Girl that when they met up again.

The other one though, that was a bit different. An Al Bhed. She would 
have thought they stayed away from groups like the Chocobo Knights. She 
knew those eyes though. A different color, but the tell-tale swirl 
remained, a symbol of her heritage. Why an Al Bhed would join the 
Knights was still beyond her, but prying wasn&#39;t her thing. Besides, she 
was just a runt anyway, a sand mouse. She waited for the Girl. What was 
taking her so long?

&quot;There you are!&quot; Right on time, Girl.

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you,&quot; Reia remarked. She looked the Girl over, 
trying to remember her name...ahh, Elma. That was it. &quot;Where&#39;s your 
little friend?&quot;

Elma started in surprise, and then frowned, her eyes darkening. &quot;You 
leave her alone. She&#39;s done nothing to you...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t intend to do anything. Do you think I&#39;m malicious? If the 
little mouse fancies herself to be a Knight, let her. It&#39;s none of my 
business who or what she is.&quot;

&quot;Little...mouse?&quot; Elma mumbled in confusion. Reia frowned. What was it 
to her what she called the other one?

&quot;Yes. Now, if you&#39;re done...&quot; she waved her hand irritably. This was the 
Girl? She was hardly fascinating.

&quot;Fine! But you better not mess with Tyhlan!&quot;

A challenge? Very well. &quot;Or what?&quot;

&quot;Or I...&quot; Elma&#39;s eyes flashed dangerously. &quot;I&#39;ll make you pay for it,&quot; 
she whispered.

&quot;I&#39;ll hold you on that promise,&quot; Reia responded coolly. &quot;Now you best go 
back and check on the little mouse. I&#39;m sure she can only lie about your 
whereabouts for so long. That&#39;s what she&#39;s doing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh! I...I have to go! Oh no, I hope she&#39;s not in trouble!&quot; Their 
confrontation forgotten, Elma dashed off in the direction she had come 
from. Reia watched her go, and then walked away, rolling her eyes.

&quot;Silly Girl.&quot; She was loyal then. Good.

----------------

&quot;Oh man, oh man, Elma better hurry up!&quot; Tyhlan muttered worriedly, 
marching back and forth mechanically. What was that doofus doing anyway? 
It wasn&#39;t like she could sit around here forever covering for her. Elma 
was really silly sometimes. Tyhlan had told her she&#39;d be happy if she 
and the captain hooked up, but geez, was that a dream or what? Tyhlan 
knew better; relationships like that never worked out. She had seen them 
crash and burn personally. Traveling alone forced her to experience a 
lot. Elma sure was different. She was totally naive, yeah, and a 
complete idiot when she was within five feet of Captain Lucil, but she 
was one of the best people Tyhlan had met. Spira needed more people like 
her.

The captain, Tyhlan thought, would have to be either blind or completely 
oblivious if she didn&#39;t notice how much Elma cared for her. Or maybe 
both. They were both stupid. Lucil would have to be a total moron, 
captain or no, if she were to turn down Elma because of stupid Yevon or 
because she was older or whatever. Whatever excuse it was going to be, 
it wouldn&#39;t be good enough for Elma. And if it wasn&#39;t good for Elma, it 
was terrible for Tyhlan. She bit her lip and shifted from side to side. 
Poor Elma was going to get her heart broken. Geez. And she was such a 
nice girl too, and pretty, and awesome with a sword, and compassionate, 
and well, Elma was just cool. That was the word. She wasn&#39;t just cool 
though, she was, well...the coolest. There wasn&#39;t anyone better.

&quot;Cadet?&quot;

Aw, geez, Tyhlan thought, glancing up at Captain Lucil. Out loud she 
said, &quot;Why captain, you&#39;re looking much better today! Is your leg 
alright?&quot;

&quot;My leg is quite alright, cadet. Thank you for asking.&quot; Lucil graced her 
with a rare smile, and Tyhlan bit her lip to keep from exploding into 
girlish giggles. She wasn&#39;t completely obsessed with the captain like 
Elma was, but the lady was pretty attractive.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, captain! Uh, what can I do for you?&quot; Geez, where did 
that come from? &#39;What can I do for you?&#39; How lame...

&quot;Well, I was wondering...where is Elma? She seems to be missing.&quot; Lucil 
gave the blonde an odd look. &quot;Have you seen her?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Come on, Tyhlan, think! You can do it! Geez, think of something! 
&quot;No?&quot; Oh yeah, so smart.

&quot;You haven&#39;t?&quot; Lucil frowned. &quot;Cadet, do you know the penalties for 
lying to a superior officer?&quot;

Oh no... &quot;Um, no ma&#39;am? But it doesn&#39;t really apply to me...right, 
captain?&quot;

Lucil&#39;s eyes darkened. &quot;Don&#39;t be cheeky cadet,&quot; she said sharply. &quot;Where 
is Elma?&quot;

&quot;I er, I...really don&#39;t know captain,&quot; Tyhlan admitted, glancing down at 
her feet. &quot;She left a little while ago. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;

&quot;That isn&#39;t the point,&quot; Lucil remarked coolly. &quot;She should not have left 
without permission, and you,&quot; Tyhlan winced, and Lucil continued, 
&quot;should not have allowed her to go wherever she went without telling me 
about it. Come with me.&quot;

&quot;Huh? What? Why? I mean, what did I do?&quot;

&quot;Come with me, cadet. We&#39;re going to find Elma.&quot;

&quot;Uhh...&quot; Tyhlan struggled to find something to waste time. &quot;It&#39;s about 
to rain, captain!&quot;

&quot;Will you melt?&quot; Lucil was already walking ahead. &quot;Consider it a 
training exercise. It will prepare you for whatever punishment I deem 
appropriate later.&quot;

Tyhlan pouted, and a raindrop fell on her nose. Elma was so going to pay 
her back for this.

---------------

Elma walked in the rain quickly, humming under her breath. The sound of 
thunder grew closer; the drizzle would turn into a full-out storm soon 
enough. She wasn&#39;t bothered by it, however. She felt decidedly more 
cheerful than she had been earlier. She was pretty sure Reia wouldn&#39;t do 
anything to bother Tyhlan now. She was pretty weird, granted, but she 
seemed honest enough.

&quot;A little mean though,&quot; Elma admitted to herself, scratching her head. 
She hadn&#39;t been gone long, so Tyhlan had most likely managed to keep the 
captain from getting suspicious. Elma grinned brightly, thinking of the 
older woman. She was so happy she was back! She saw a streak of 
lightning flit across the sky, and was about to break into a run, when 
she bumped into something.

&quot;Hey, huh? Oh...um...&quot; she grinned cheerfully. &quot;Hi?&quot;

Lucil was standing in front of her, with a sullen Tyhlan trailing 
behind. &quot;Hello. Skipping training sessions to take an afternoon stroll?&quot;

As if on cue, the sky burst above them, and rain fell down in thick 
sheets. Elma could only look down and groan. Busted.

--------------

&quot;Captain, please don&#39;t punish Tyhlan! It&#39;s all my fault!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s her fault, captain.&quot;

&quot;Tyhlan!&quot;

Lucil closed her eyes and leaned against a wall, rubbing her temples. 
Although the mages had done a fine job of patching her up, she was still 
rather tired. They were only able to hold off the fiends for a short 
period of time; she would not be surprised if she was made to return to 
the battlefield. Her two cadets had fallen silent when she did not 
speak, and they both alternatively looked at the floor, then at each 
other. They looked quite chastised, and she hadn&#39;t even begun yet.

&quot;I&#39;d like to know, first of all, why you disappeared,&quot; she remarked, 
addressing Elma. The young lady shifted guiltily before responding.

&quot;I was looking for someone,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;A friend.&quot;

A lie, that much was certain. She didn&#39;t even glance up at once, and 
Lucil imagined that, if she had, she would have seen the shame mirrored 
there. A significant other, perhaps? She had dealt with such before, but 
it seemed rather...unlike Elma to shirk duty for an afternoon tryst. The 
thought of it made Lucil a bit uneasy. She was the best cadet, and it 
would be a shame if she ruined her reputation as such.

&quot;A friend?&quot;

Elma&#39;s eyes shifted to Tyhlan for a momement. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot;

Tyhlan however, looked as confused as Lucil felt. She gave Elma an odd 
look, as if to ask, What friend? The girl certainly did look very uneasy 
though...perhaps something had happened that she didn&#39;t want to share 
with them...but she had seemed awfully cheery, until she had bumped into 
them, that is. This was all very strange. She gave Elma a look, but the 
girl merely averted her eyes. Very well. She wouldn&#39;t force it out of 
her.

&quot;Since both of you have forgotten proper protocol, I have an assignment 
for you. You are to both travel through Djose and beyond, to help escort 
Lord Braska and his entourage through Mi&#39;hen, which is still very 
crowded with rogue fiends. You&#39;ll be taking an older cadet with you. I 
expect you to follow her orders without complaint, is that understood? 
You&#39;ll be gone for a couple of days, at most.&quot;

Elma looked less than excited, but Tyhlan visibly brightened. She most 
likely wanted to meet the &#39;fallen&#39; summoner.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; they chorused. Lucil nodded.

&quot;Very well. You are both dismissed.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Elma finally asked. She bit her lip and brushed her hair away 
from her face, only to have it fall again. Lucil bit down a grin. &quot;Might 
I ask who the older cadet is?&quot;

&quot;Her name is Reia. She&#39;s very young, but she&#39;s an excellent fighter. I 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she had her own troops to train in a year or 
so.&quot; Lucil frowned when she saw a shadow fall across Elma&#39;s face. Tyhlan 
just looked a bit frightened. &quot;You two don&#39;t know her, do you?&quot;

&quot;No ma&#39;am!&quot;

&quot;Very well then...&quot; Lucil&#39;s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. &quot;You two are 
dismissed. Be ready early morning; she&#39;ll be coming to pick you up, is 
that understood?&quot;

Both of the girls nodded, saluted, and exited. Lucil closed her eyes 
briefly.

&quot;Odd girls...&quot; Her decision had been just, however. She admitted quietly 
to herself that she most likely would have made them both go if they 
hadn&#39;t broken any rules. A bit of work with unfamiliar faces would do 
them good. Besides, she was almost positive they would be impressed with 
the Aeons Lord Braska had gathered. She doubted they had seen them all.

She was a bit disappointed that she wouldn&#39;t be able to see the excited 
look on Elma&#39;s face when she did see the magnificent Aeons, but that was 
neither here nor there, was it? She coughed into her fist. She was 
thinking oddly; a nap would most likely be beneficial. Nodding to 
herself, she walked off toward her quarters.

--------------

A/N: Yay for four different POVs! If you all like it, or dislike things 
this way, be sure to tell me. This chapter is a little short, I think, 
but that is because I want to save the meeting with Braska and his 
guardians(YAY AURON) for the next chapter. What would you call them? Um. 
ABJ or something? Wait. BAJ. I dunno. How about we just not call them 
anything.

Catch the reference to a Final Fantasy in this chapter, and you get a 
parfait! Everyone loves parfaits! It is not from a previous game this 
time though, so remember that! Also, Chibi Yuna Slave, you are totally 
right! Good thing that mage in the last chapter didn&#39;t get to say his 
name, because it would have made the story a trippy crossover. It was a 
reference to Godo, from Final Fantasy VII. =P Anyway, I&#39;ll see you wacky 
dudes next chapter!</pre>
