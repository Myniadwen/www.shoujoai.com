<h1>Because She Is</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>You love her because....

She&#39;s beautiful? Well, to you she is, but to others she is only pretty, 
attractive. Cute. But you are satisfied with thinking she&#39;s beautiful, 
because you&#39;re the one who sees her before the sun has risen, when her 
vision is hazy with sleep, and her dark eyes are warm with love, and 
perhaps a bit of passion that she managed to keep awake, even when her 
body was at rest. You&#39;re the one who hears, &quot;Good morning,&quot; in a voice 
husky with sleep, the one who sees her tousled hair and her soft, lithe 
body against white sheets, and her, &#39;I&#39;m still very tired but last night 
was wonderful,&#39; smile, and you know that, though the rest of the world 
might not see it, that she is beautiful...

Because...

you observe her, and you have, even when she was younger, much younger, 
and more of a subordinate than she is now. You watched her when it was 
wrong to, and you watch her twice as much, now that it&#39;s right. She is 
warm, and very bright. She is a star, brilliant and iridescent. 
Sometimes, she is too much, a spring of energy, of bright, wonderful 
light, and you feel unworthy, small and insignificant. She tells you 
that she should be the one that feels that way, and you let her light 
and warmth nourish you....

Because...

if you didn&#39;t, you&#39;d be lost. When Mi&#39;hen came, and with it, Sin, and 
everyone and everything was gone, your mind regressed. Basic thoughts. 
Breathe, run, fight. Find. And when you tripped over bodies too damaged 
to recognize, swallowed the bile in your throat because the stench of 
Sin&#39;s toxin was too much to handle...and you saw her there, on the 
shore, so small, and convered in blood. You staggered over to her and 
held her, sobbed into her hair until she whispered in a soft, pitiful 
voice, that she was alright. You told her she wasn&#39;t, and that it was 
your fault, because it was, and she laughed until you were both crying. 
It is hard to laugh, even now, but she makes it a little easier. When 
you wake up screaming and shivering, she holds you, and you whimper like 
a child in her arms. She is safety...

because...

she has always been there, even when you didn&#39;t know it. She has been 
with you when you only spoke to her to bark orders, when you traveled 
together, fighting fiends, when you both questioned your faith, and 
later, with the fall of Sin and Yevon, denounced it. She is with you 
now, your troops have settled down, and she leans against your shoulder 
and sighs. This is what happiness is, you think.

&quot;I love you,&quot; you say. She laughs.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; and you smile, &quot;just because.&quot; </pre>
