<h1>Two Forms, One Mind</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/truedarkhero.html">TrueDarkHero</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors note: 

This is my first fanfic, so I can only hope it is half decent. Please 
comment on it so I can tell where I screwed up. Also, I do not own any 
of these characters, or any of the settings. 



I stared at Yuna; aware of how beautiful she was, standing in the 
moonlight on a night such as this. I sighed. It was at times like these 
that I hated to lie about who I really was. But then, only my mother and 
a few others had ever known. No one had ever managed to guess so far. 

&quot;Tidus?&quot; I heard a voice call my &#39;name&#39;. I turned and saw that it was 
Wakka, I sighed once more, before rising from the comfortable spot which 
I had been sitting in. The group had stopped at an inn, one which we all 
had gratefully collapsed into. We were all exhausted, and I thought 
longingly of the bed that awaited me, but I turned anyway to see what 
Wakka wanted. 

&quot;Ya Wakka?&quot; I said, the necklace around my neck altering my voice to 
sound like that of a male. It had been apart of the elaborate scheme my 
mother had come up with when I was just a baby. 

&quot;Well, Lu told me to give you a bit of a warning. You are to keep your 
hands off of Yuna and you are not to make any encouraging moves toward 
Yuna, understood, ya?&quot; Wakka said, flushing a bit. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; I have no intention of doing anything of the sort. A guy 
can watch a beautiful woman sometimes right?&quot; I said, although I 
privately thought that if Yuna ever found out what I truly was that Yuna 
would hate me forever. So I had decided long ago to love her from afar, 
and protect her when I could. &quot;No crime in watching right?&quot; 

&quot;Well, as long as you keep it to looks alone, and try not to let Lulu 
catch you. I am sorry, bro; I know how much you like her.&quot; Wakka said, 
before he walked over to rejoin Lulu and Yuna by the fire. Before long, 
the three of them were in deep conversation, talking about who knew 
what. 

I sighed again, and made for my room. I had had my own room this time, 
and I decided to take advantage of the rarity and to take a nice long 
bath. Once in my room, I slipped off the necklace, and placed it on the 
night table next to the bed. I filled the bath that was in one corner, 
added some bubble bath, and stripped off my clothes. I removed the 
constricting hologrid off, which gave me the appearance of a male body. 

I slid into the bath, and a small moan escaped from my lips. I could 
barely recognize the voice of myself, so little I had heard of it. 

I hummed softly to myself, and played with the bubbles for awhile. After 
awhile I started to scrub a months worth of grim out of my short blonde 
hair, and it took quite awhile to do so. I had just pulled the plug, and 
stepped out of the bath, when Rikku burst into the room, slamming the 
door behind her, saying &quot;. well, Tidus won&#39;t mind my company!&quot; on the 
other side of the door I could hear Wakka groan in frustration. 

&quot;Rikku!&quot; I shouted, before grabbing the nearby towel. I had no sooner 
said the words when I realized that I wasn&#39;t wearing my necklace and 
that I had emitted my true voice. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Rikku spun sharply at the sound of a female&#39;s voice. Before her stood a 
young blonde woman who had a towel clutched around her midsection. She 
had obviously just stepped out of the bath, and her short blonde hair 
was quite shorter, shorter then even Yunas short hair. Rikku looked 
around carefully, but could see no sign of Tidus anywhere. 

&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; Rikku asked the young woman, &quot;Just what in 
machina&#39;s name are you doing in Tidus&#39;s room? Where is he anyway?&quot; Rikku 
looked around again, as if to make sure that Tidus wasn&#39;t hiding under 
the bed. 

&quot;Please, lower your voice. If you wait a moment, I will get dressed and 
explain it to you.&quot; The blonde woman said in her soft, musical voice. 
She picked up a corset like object, and Rikku turned around. It took 
only a minute or two for the woman to say, &quot;Okay, you can turn around, I 
am decent.&quot; 

Rikku did turn around, and was shocked to see Tidus standing where only 
moments ago had stood the woman. She looked around frantically, and 
could not spot the woman. 

&quot;Where did she go?&quot; Rikku asked in confusion. 

&quot;Rikku.&quot; The woman said her voice coming form Tidus. 

&quot;Where is that coming from?&quot; Rikku said, before she dashed behind Tidus 
to look in the bathtub to make sure the woman wasn&#39;t hiding in there. 

&quot;Rikku, if you will just look at me, I will explain it to you.&quot; Tidus 
said in the musical voice of the woman. 

&quot;That voice is coming from you?!?&quot; Rikku said, her voice escalating to 
an extremely high pitch. Outside the door, Wakka and Auron were knocking 
on the door, asking if everything was alright. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I sighed, before I grabbed the necklace from the table and held it up to 
my chest. 

&quot;Yah, everything is fine, I was bathing when Rikku came in without 
KNOCKING!&quot; I said in my male voice, &quot;We&#39;ll be out in a bit while I 
explain to her the necessity of knocking.&quot; Auron laughed, and presumably 
led a speechless Wakka to where Yuna and Lulu were. 

I put the necklace back down, and sat down on the bed. I motioned for 
Rikku to sit, and she did, although she looked extremely confused and 
wary. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Rikku, it is still just me.&quot; I said, my true voice sounding 
through the room. 

&quot;What... how. when. why?&quot; Rikku asked me. I had known eventually someone 
would find out, but I had hoped to have more time to come up with a good 
explanation. 

&quot;What you saw was the real me, beneath all this clothing. The how is my 
wardrobe. My necklace alters my voice to the voice you hear from me 
usually. When you walked in on me, and saw my body, that is my real 
body. The corset you saw me put on is actually a hologrid, which gives 
me the body of a male where my skin is visible.&quot; I said calmly. I looked 
at her, to see how she was taking it. She seemed to be interested, so I 
continued on, &quot;I have always had to wear these things, as long as I can 
remember. I have had to do this, and I couldn&#39;t just stop, especially as 
you all know me only as Tidus.&quot; I said. 

&quot;But why would you do this to yourself? And if you aren&#39;t the real 
Tidus, then who are you?&quot; 

&quot;I am the real Tidus. Tidus is the name my mother gave my male form. My 
real name is Tidu, the one my mother gave me at birth. And the reason 
why I put myself through this is because my mother had been getting 
threats while she was pregnant with me, saying that they would kill me. 
So she came up with a plan to keep me safe. She thought that if they 
thought I was a big strong male that they would leave me alone. And they 
did, but only because I was male. So I was male to all except to my 
mother, and to a close friend, who died when I was ten. To them, in 
private, I was me, and I could be who I truly am.&quot; I explained to Rikku, 
whose mouth was agape. 

&quot;But didn&#39;t Jeckt know? Why didn&#39;t you tell us?&quot; Rikku asked when she 
regained her wits. 

&quot;No, Jeckt did not know. To him, I was the crybaby little boy that he 
was ashamed of.&quot; I paused, not knowing how to explain to her my fears. 

&quot;But why didn&#39;t you tell us when we first met?&quot; Rikku asked again. 

&quot;Because I couldn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t know your society; I didn&#39;t know anything 
about the strange world I had found myself in. And by the time I had 
gained any useful knowledge, I had already joined up with Wakka, to go 
to Luca, to see if I would recognize anyone. I had also already met 
Lulu, and Yuna, as well as a good many people. I didn&#39;t want to lose 
their friendship, even if it is a grudgingly given.&quot; I smiled weakly, 
and shifted my eyes to the floor, before slipping my necklace over my 
head. 

&quot;You should know better. We are your friends, and we will like you 
however you are.&quot; Rikku said, turning my head to face her. &quot;We wouldn&#39;t 
be good friends if we would turn you out for something like this. I hope 
you know that, Tidu.&quot; She told me softly. 

&quot;I know, but I still prefer to be a guy until I can gauge their 
reactions. Please don&#39;t tell anyone.&quot; I said my voice back to its 
altered version. 

&quot;Okay, I won&#39;t, but now I have a new nickname for you! You are now Ty! 
To me anyway.&quot; Rikku started to slip away, but she paused at the door, 
&quot;You know, you make one hot chick and a very cute guy.&quot; She winked at 
me, and bounced out the room, calling to the others as she went. 

I rubbed my eyes, and turned out the light. I lay there for quite 
awhile, thinking, and the moon was starting to set when I drifted off to 
sleep, an image of Yuna imbedded in my mind. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I woke to feel someone roughly shaking my shoulder. I opened my eyes to 
see Rikku standing there, shaking me awake. 

&quot;I am awake already, what do you want?&quot; I said sleepily. 

&quot;Ty! Yuna is in danger!&quot; Rikku said, her face etched with fear. 

That brought me fully awake. I grabbed Brotherhood, and my curative 
shield, and rushed off, not even listening to Rikku, who shouted 
instructions after me, before going to wake the others up. I rushed 
towards Yuna&#39;s screams. 

&quot;YUNA! I AM COMING!&quot; I shouted as I burst out the inn&#39;s door. I rushed 
to where Yuna was standing; unprotected, trapped by an ogre fiend, 
except it was the largest I had ever seen. 

&quot;Yuna!&quot; I called to her, as I rushed to block a punch that was aimed for 
her head. I caught it on my left arm, and I grimaced as pain lanced 
through my shoulder, before I struck a fighting stance. I could see that 
Yuna had sprained her ankle, so I started to provoke the fiend away from 
Yuna, making it mad enough to follow me away from where Yuna sat with a 
pained expression. 

When I thought it was far enough away from Yuna for the fiend not to see 
Yuna, I started to attack it. I used quick hit to dig a chunk out of the 
creatures side, and it responded by attacking me, punching wildly at my 
moving form. I managed to miss three of its fists, but was struck by the 
fourth. I could see that the others had come out. Lulu, Rikku, and 
Kimari went to Yuna, while Auron and Wakka rushed to my aide. 

Suddenly, I felt fangs dig into my shoulder, and I saw that a Lupine 
fiend had snuck up on me while I had been otherwise engaged. I flung it 
to the ground, but was not able to block the four blows from the ogre, 
and I fell, my vision straying to Yuna, who was leaning against Rikku. I 
could hear her voice screaming my name, but then my vision blackened 
out, and I fell into the void of unconsciousness. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I awoke slowly, my senses slowly absorbing the environment around me. 
The room that I was lying in was quiet, and the lights were on, but not 
shining brightly. I opened my eyes, and looked around, turning my head 
to look at the sleeping figure sitting in the chair beside me. Yuna 
looked strained, even in the depths of sleep. I took note that I was not 
in my room, but in another&#39;s room, whose I did not know, as I hadn&#39;t 
gone to see the others the night before. I sat up slowly, letting the 
wall at the head of the bed support my back. I saw that Rikku was curled 
up next to Yuna, and that Wakka and Lulu were sleeping on the couch at 
the opposite end of the room. Auron stood outside the door, muttering to 
himself. The only one that was awake in the room besides me was Kimari. 

&quot;Little Warrior fought well. You save Yuna. Kimari thank you.&quot; Kimari 
said softly, bowing his head slightly, before he padded out of the room 
to speak with Auron. 

Rikku had woken when Kimari had spoken, and looked at me. She got up, 
and sat on the edge of the bed. She looked worried, and but when she saw 
that I wasn&#39;t about to fall unconscious again, she smiled weakly. 

&quot;You gave us quite a scare, Ty. We were really worried about you. Auron 
and Wakka defeated the Ogre and the Lupine after you fell, and Kimari 
brought you in. That was a brave thing you did, drawing it away. You 
saved Yuna&#39;s life. Yuna felt guilty that you got hurt, so when she talks 
to you, please, try to reassure her.&quot; Rikku said, before she got up to 
wake the others. 

&quot;Hey man, you had us worried there. It&#39;s good to see you awake, so when 
do you. hey Lu! Okay, I&#39;ll get out, just quit smacking me!&quot; Wakka said 
as Lulu smacked him out the door. She shot me a small smile before she 
disappeared out the door. Rikku woke Yuna up, and then shot out of the 
room, mumbling something about food. 

When I turned my attention to my summoner, I was surprised to see that 
tears were spilling out down her cheeks. She looked remorseful that I 
got hurt, and was clearly feeling guilty able it. 

&quot;Hey, Yuna.&quot; I said softly &quot;Come sit with me.&quot; I offered, patting the 
area next to me in invitation. 

She did not accept right away, however, and just sat there, tears 
slipping silently down her cheeks. When she did come to sit next to me, 
she gave me a crushing hug. 

&quot;I am so sorry Tidus, I am so sorry.&quot; She whispered into my ear while 
she cried into my shoulder, gripping my vest so as not to let go. 

&quot;Hey, its okay, I know you didn&#39;t want me to get hurt, it was an 
accident. You are not to blame, and I know I don&#39;t blame you, so you 
have to stop blaming yourself. It wasn&#39;t your fault. I am going to get 
better, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; I said soothingly in reply. 

&quot;I thought I had lost you; please don&#39;t ever leave me, Tidus! Don&#39;t ever 
leave me.&quot; She said to me. 

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t. I won&#39;t leave until you tell me to leave.&quot; I 
promised to her. 

We stayed that way for a long time, and we both fell asleep that way. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I woke with a start, having dreamt the promise I had made to Yuna. We 
were aboard the airship, and were heading toward Bevelle, where Yuna was 
to be married to Seymour. I shuddered at the thought of my beloved Yuna 
marrying that monster, and I went to the bridge. It was still night, but 
we were nearing our destination, and would be there in the morning. Only 
Brother was on the bridge, and he was piloting, so I could just stand 
there in peace. 

&quot;What are you doing here so early, Tidus?&quot; Cid asked me from behind me. 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep. So I decided to come here until we arrived.&quot; I 
replied harshly. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get her back.&quot; He said to me. There was nothing I 
could say to that, so I remained silent. We arrived just before midday, 
and we all rush off the airship, only to meet warrior monks. We rushed 
them, and took down several. We ran through them, and continued to run, 
shoving anyone who got away, and taking down any who were persistent. We 
reached where the wedding was taking place, and I climbed the stairs to 
be with Yuna. The others made sure that no warrior monks would disturb 
us. 

&quot;Yuna!&quot; I called to her as I reached her side. She turned to look at me, 
and her eyes told me of her silent resignation. Seymour, however, was 
not as silent. 

&quot;You again? I thought I had gotten rid of you. Leave, before I kill 
you.&quot; He said in his oily voice. I just ignored him and turned my 
attention on Yuna. She looked beautiful in her gown, and I struggled to 
say the words I had to say. 

&quot;Yuna.&quot; I began softly, but Seymour shoved me roughly back, and I fell 
down several steps before I managed to regain my balance. 

&quot;Boy, leave us to be married in peace. She doesn&#39;t want you, she wants 
me. Now be gone!&quot; Seymour said to me harshly, the voice biting each 
word. 

I looked at Yuna. &quot;You look beautiful, Yuna.&quot; I told her, &quot;Unless you 
tell me to go, I will not go. Unless you can tell me you are marrying 
for love, I will not leave you here to be a wife in a loveless 
marriage.&quot; I told her softly, my voice echoing slightly. 

Yuna just looked at me, and I could almost hear her silent plea. 

&quot;Go Tidus, and do not return.&quot; She told me. I could feel my heart stop, 
and freeze in my chest. I felt as if I had been dealt a blow, and I 
staggered slightly. I looked up at her, and I could see the tears in her 
eyes. I hardened slightly, and gazed at her coolly. 

&quot;Fine, I will.&quot; with that said, I tackled Seymour, and we both plunged 
of the cliff that had been behind them, the building having been built 
out of it. 

We plunged downward, and Seymour smashed into the cliff a few times, 
before falling onto a small ledge, landing with a resounding crack. I 
knew he would not die, but I knew that he would be grievously injured. I 
continued to fall downward, and I could feel the air whipping past me. I 
breathed it all in, and I prayed that my death on the rocks below would 
be swift. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Yuna, I failed you.&quot; I said softly, as I neared the ground 
below me. I thought of her last words to me. 

&#39;Go Tidus, and do not return.&#39; She had said to me. Each word had hurt me 
more then I would like to admit, but could not grieve for her, because I 
had prevented her from doing something she would regret. I would know 
that I had done something useful for her. 

Suddenly, my fall slowed then stopped, and I could feel the claws 
gripping onto the back of my vest. I was slowly lifted, and I looked up 
to see Valefor was gripping me in his talons, Yuna sitting on his 
shoulders. Valefor brought me up to the balcony from which I had fallen, 
and Yuna unsummoned him. Yuna ran up to me and gave me a fierce hug. We 
were surrounded by warrior monks, and we were far too out numbered to 
try to fight them. We were escorted to the labyrinth beneath the city, 
where we were left to die, or find our eventual way out. 

We stayed near the entranceway for a while, and the others discussed a 
plan of action. I stood near the path into the maze, as far as I could 
get from Yuna without actually entering the maze. I could see the 
nervous looks Yuna would shoot me every now and again, but I could not 
face her. After awhile, they seemed to have settled what they were going 
to do, so they separated and went to find a spot to get some sleep. 
Auron came to talk to me. 

&quot;It&#39;s decided. We are going to go into the maze, and try to find our way 
out of here, but we shall mark our trail so that we can find our way 
back here if need be. So, care to tell me why you took both Seymour and 
yourself over the cliff?&quot; Auron said. 

&quot;Simple. She didn&#39;t want me there, but she didn&#39;t really want to marry 
Seymour, so I figured I might as well make both her wishes come true at 
the same time. Didn&#39;t figure she&#39;d save me.&quot; I replied to him, sitting 
down, and bracing my legs so I could lean my arms across them. &quot;You got 
something you want to say?&quot; I asked to Auron, who had continued to stand 
there. 

&quot;Yes, I do. Did it occur to you that she just wanted to protect you? She 
loves you; get it through your thick skull. She didn&#39;t want to hurt 
you.&quot; Auron said gruffly, before going to join Kimari near Yuna. 

&quot;Even if she does, she won&#39;t when she finds out what I am. And some 
things hurt more then some people think.&quot; I muttered to myself, and 
rested my head against my knees, trying to rid myself of her words. I 
eventually fell asleep, but not before a few salty tears fell from my 
eyes. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

*I gaze at him constantly. I had had told him to go, but I could see the 
pain I caused him. I could have sworn someone had stabbed him. When he 
fell. no, I will not think what could have happened. I almost lost him, 
and the last words I would have said to him was that I didn&#39;t want him 
around anymore.* Yuna thought silently, gazing at Tidus&#39;s still form at 
the other end on the room. She could feel the tears trickling down her 
cheeks, and she wiped them hastily away. But although everyone pretended 
not to notice, Rikku did notice, and she came to talk to Yuna quietly. 

&quot;Yuna, can I talk to you?&quot; Rikku asked Yuna in a soft, quiet voice. Yuna 
nodded, and Rikku sat down next to her. &quot;I know you feel sad about what 
Ty did, but you must understand, you hurt her. umm. him badly. He would 
have probably preferred that you had told him the truth. He did what he 
could do to go away, and to get rid of Seymour. She saw your silent 
plea, he saw what you would not say, and he took it in his own hands. He 
did what he could. Don&#39;t be mad at him, or scared of him, he was just 
doing what most people would have done.&quot; 

&quot;I am not mad at him. I just can&#39;t believe what he was willing to give 
up for me. He would have died had I not saved him.&quot; Yuna said softly, 
tears squeezing their way out of the corner of her eyes. 

Rikku gently wiped away the tears. &quot;You know, some people believe there 
are fates worse then death. Like loving someone who you think hates you, 
or you cannot be with, for whatever reason. Just remember, though what 
he did may seem stupid, he may just have wanted you to be happy. Maybe 
he is not all the he seems, and he thinks you and he don&#39;t stand a 
chance together.&quot; Rikku said a bit mysteriously, and before Yuna could 
ask what she meant, Rikku said &quot;Oh, looky, Wakka is getting smacked by 
Auron; I am going to see why.&quot; Before darting off to go see what the 
fuss was about. 

*what could he be hiding?* Yuna wondered silently, *what could be so 
horrible that he could think that I could not accept him anyway? And I 
need to remind Lulu to refresh Rikku&#39;s grammar, she kept getting she and 
he mixed up.* 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I could feel my body convulse, and each convulsion was worse than the 
last. My body shook from the pressure, but I knew they would pass. They 
always have. I just didn&#39;t expect them anymore. I had not had tem since 
I came to this world, so I thought they had stopped. After a while, the 
started to lessen, and I loosened my grip on my pant leg. I felt a 
soothing touch on my back, and I looked up to see Yuna gently rubbing my 
back. 

&quot;Yuna?&quot; I whispered softly, trembling slightly. The convulsions had 
stopped, but the experience had left me weak and shivering. 

&quot;I am sorry I said those words to you Tidus,&quot; It felt like a slap, 
hearing my false name on her lips, &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to see me married. 
I didn&#39;t want to hurt you. I am sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Some fates can be worse then death. And I wanted to do something useful 
before I left your life.&quot; I replied to her softly, my body slowly 
relaxing. &quot;I am the one who should be sorry; I didn&#39;t want to live 
knowing you hated me.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Tidus, I don&#39;t hate you. Far from it. You are my friend Tidus, and 
although I may seem to be a bit, well, childish, I hope you know you can 
tell me anything.&quot; Yuna said to me, grasping me by my shoulders, making 
sure I got the point. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t childish. You are a mature, beautiful woman who deserves 
something I cannot give you.&quot; I said to her softly. 

&quot;What can&#39;t you give me Tidus? I love you, and that is all that 
matters.&quot; She replied to me. 

My heart soared, before plunging back down. &quot;I love you, too, with all 
of my heart, but I am not who I seem to be. You could not love who I 
truly am.&quot; I replied sadly, a single tear falling from my eye. 

&quot;Then show me who you really are. I am sure it is not as bad as you are 
making it out to be.&quot; Yuna asked me. 

&quot;No, I can&#39;t I am sorry, Yuna, I love you with all my heart. Remember 
me.&quot; With that I got up, and ran headlong into the maze, frantic to get 
away. I could hear the others chasing after me, but soon their foot 
steps faded, and I ran on alone. I wandered aimlessly around for awhile, 
before I found a thin crack, which lead outside the maze, I looked at 
the bright sun for a moment, and I looked back at the crack, before I 
returned to the maze to find the others. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Yuna could still see in her mind Tidus running off into the maze. She 
could feel the tears run down her face as she and the others searched 
for him. They had found the fayth a while back, and she could now summon 
Balamut, but she wanted to find Tidus, and to find out what his secret 
was, she had questioned Rikku, but Rikku would not tell her and the 
others could not think of anything that she didn&#39;t already know. 

A long while later, they came across an arrow carved into the wall, 
pointing down one of the paths. It had the letters &#39;ty&#39; carved under it. 
They followed it, and they came across another, and another, and it led 
them to a crack, which led them out of the maze. In the dirt, was a 
message written by Tidus. 

&#39;I hope you found the arrows. I am sorry I ran off. Do not try and find 
me, I will find you when I am ready. Please continue on with out me. 
Tidus&#39; 

Yuna looked at the message sadly, before she and the other continued on 
through to Macalania Woods. They wandered for a while, before setting up 
camp for the night. Yuna went off for a walk to clear her head, and she 
walked aimlessly around. 

Just as she was about to return to camp, she heard a sound coming from 
off the path. It was a human sob. Intrigued, Yuna followed it to its 
owner. It led to young blonde woman, whose hair was short, and clothing 
was strangely familiar. Near her was a strange looking article of 
clothing, but Yuna thought that it was unimportant. The young woman 
sobbed, and Yuna could tell that the woman did not know she was here. 

&quot;Why are you crying?&quot; Yuna asked quietly. 

The woman started, before saying, &quot;go away, I don&#39;t want company.&quot; The 
woman&#39;s voice was soft, and musical, although a bit strained. 

&quot;Will you not tell me why you are crying at the very least?&quot; Yuna urged 
gently. 

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; came the simple reply. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Yuna said as she stepped forward. There was a crunching 
sound, and Yuna looked down to see what see had stepped on. It was a 
necklace. In fact, it was Tidus&#39;s necklace. 

&quot;Did you see a man come by here? He has blonde hair, like yours, and 
clothes just like yours.&quot; Yuna asked the young woman. This only caused 
the woman to cry even harder. 

&quot;Did he hurt you?&quot; Yuna asked softly. 

&quot;No, no, nothing like that.&quot; The woman turned to face Yuna. 

Yuna gasped at what she saw. The woman looked remarkably like Tidus, and 
if it weren&#39;t for the fact that she was a different gender, she would 
have sworn it was Tidus. 

&quot;You look just like Tidus.&quot; Yuna whispered. The woman bent down, and put 
on the article of clothing. When she had put it on fully, slowly, 
muscles, and sinews built up, and strengthened. The woman started to 
gain masculine features, until Yuna swore she was a male. When the woman 
next spoke, Yuna was startled to see Tidus standing there. 

&quot;Pass me my necklace.&quot; The Tidus, woman, whoever it was said. Yuna 
tossed her the necklace, and he/she/it put it around their neck. The 
person now looked identical to Tidus. 

&quot;So now you know why.&quot; Tidus said to Yuna. Yuna just stood there, 
dumbfounded. 

&quot;What are you?&quot; Yuna said in horror. 

Tidus flinched at the tone of Yuna&#39;s voice. &quot;I am Tidus, the one you 
said you loved not two days ago. I am actually female. This necklace 
alters my voice to make it sound male, and the corset you saw me put on 
is actually a hologrid, which allows me to take the form of a male.&quot; 
Tidus explained. 

&quot;Just who are you?&quot; Yuna said softly, her confusion evident in her 
voice. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

&quot;Just who are you?&quot; Yuna asked me. I had hoped that she would 
understand, but I don&#39;t think that she will. 

&quot;My true name is Tidu. My male form is Tidus. I. I understand if you 
hate me. I am sorry I had to lie to you. I never wanted to, but it was 
to protect me in my old world.&quot; I said, my hopes fading quickly as Yuna 
turned, and run back toward where I knew they had made camp. I felt the 
tears leave burning streaks on my face. I took the brotherhood, the 
blade that Wakka had given me, and thrust into the ground. I placed my 
curative shield at the base, and walked away. As I walked away I ripped 
off the hologrid, and threw the necklace in the direction of the 
brotherhood. My heart was breaking, and there was nothing I could do. I 
had told her how I had felt, and I had told, but she could not accept 
it. So I did what I did best: I ran. I ran until I could no longer run, 
and still I ran. I ran until I fell to the ground. I keened my grief 
into the night, and let the tears come, until my eyes dried, and I feel 
into an exhausted sleep.

Yuna ran all the way back to camp. She could not believe it. Tidus was a 
girl named Tidu! She had fallen in love with a girl! What bugged her was 
the fact that she had not seen through the disguise, and she was 
disgusted that she had allowed herself to fall in love with the fraud. 

When she arrived at camp, everyone could tell that something had 
happened. That something was wrong. Yuna sought Rikku out, and started 
to rage at her. 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Yuna shouted at Rikku. 

&quot;Tell you what?&quot; Rikku replied, a confused expression on her face. 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that Tidus was a girl?&quot; Yuna shouted at her. The 
camp went silent. They all focused on Rikku and Yuna. 

&quot;Because she asked me not to tell, for this very reason. For fear that 
you would reject her for doing something she had done to survive in her 
world, and that she had been using when she had been thrown into this 
world. She didn&#39;t reveal herself for what she was because she loved you, 
and didn&#39;t want to have to face rejection. And I thought you would have 
understood. That you loved her enough to not care what gender she was, 
that you would realize that she is still the same old Ty!&quot; Rikku yelled 
at Yuna, fury written across her face, &quot;You know what; apparently I 
don&#39;t know you at all. Love isn&#39;t discriminate, it does not care what 
gender, age, or race a person is, it just happens. And true love can 
survive anything. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I am going to go see if I can 
find Ty.&quot; And Rikku left, muttering to herself, and heading in the 
direction from which Yuna had come. 

&quot;Yuna surprise Kimari.&quot; Kimari said. 

&quot;What?&quot; Yuna said. 

&quot;Kimari thought you love Ty. Kimari always know Tidus female. May look 
male, but smell female. Kimari thought you love Tidus no matter what.&quot; 
Kimari said, before he turned, and sat back down. The others followed 
suit. Yuna stood there, before following Rikku into the darkness. 

Yuna found Rikku kneeling on the ground, holding something in her hand 
and staring at something straight ahead of her. Yuna looked to where 
Rikku was looking, and saw the brotherhood and Tidus&#39;s shield where she 
had stood before. Yuna looked down to see what was in Rikku&#39;s hand. In 
Rikku&#39;s hand shone the necklace that Yuna had held earlier. Yuna 
swallowed a sob, and rushed in the direction that she thought Tidu would 
have take. She found the hologrid, and continued on in that direction. 
She eventually stumbled across Tidu, who slept in a fitful sleep. 

&quot;Tidu?&quot; Yuna asked softly, kneeling down next to the sleeping woman. 
Yuna gently took the sleeping figure and leaned her across her lap, and 
waited for her to wake. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Rikku stood in the shadows, crying softly at the sight that she saw. 
Yuna was holding Tidu&#39;s head, and Tidu was fast asleep. Rikku had hoped 
that now that Yuna had rejected the lovely Tidu that Tidu would turn to 
Rikku to love. She knew now that it wasn&#39;t likely to happen, that she 
would likely have to continue to stand in the shadows, to love Tidu from 
afar. 

Tidu stirred, and opened her beautiful blue eyes, and gaze up into Yunas 
eyes. Tidu sat up, and muttered a hushed apology to Yuna. Yuna shook her 
head, and said something that Rikku did not hear. Rikku moved closer, 
and listened hard to hear them speak. 

&quot;.to be sorry, I came to you. I am sorry I did not react to who you are 
well, it was such a surprise to find out. I never suspected, not once. I 
am sorry that I hurt you, but I realize now, even if you are female, 
that I still love you, and love you all the more for telling me.&quot; Yuna 
said apologetically. 

&quot;I love you, and I always will. I will never leave you, until you 
yourself tell me to leave. I will be at your side to the end.&quot; Tidu 
promised. 

&quot;Tidu.&quot; Yuna said, as they leaned forward and gave each other a hug. 

&quot;Yuna.&quot; was all that was said, before they shared a tender kiss. It 
lasted for only a brief moment, but it was enough of an indication for 
Rikku to leave. She left, and headed for camp. Once there, she climbed a 
nearby tree, and sat on a branch, just looking up at the stars. She 
cried silently for someone she could never have.

&quot;Poor Rikku.&quot; Lulu said, her ruby eyes looking up at the dejected thief. 

&quot;Am I missing something here?&quot; Auron said glancing up at Rikku. He was 
echoed by all the others in the camp. 

&quot;Yes, you are.&quot; Lulu said simply. She had seen the way Rikku had often 
looked at Tidus, and heard how passionately she had spoken to Yuna about 
love. 

*The poor girl is in love with Tidus* Lulu thought. *Sad that such a 
thing had to come to such an end.* 

&quot;Care to let us in on the secret?&quot; Auron said impatiently. 

&quot;Look at how Rikku sits.&quot; Lulu suggested to him. 

He looked and Auron thought for a moment. &quot;She looks. sad. somehow. But 
it is probably just Rikku, and her wild moods.&quot; He shrugged, and sat 
down. 

*Only it is so much more than just Rikku&#39;s wild moods, I can only hope 
Tidus can find it in her heart to love Rikku as well.* Lulu thought, 
before she also sat down, and stared deeply into the fire. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

&quot;Come Yuna, there is someone I need to speak to.&quot; I said. 

&quot;Who do you need to talk to?&quot; Yuna asked me. 

&quot;I had a dream.&quot; I replied, remembering the dream. 

It was a dark plain, where I stood. The ground was barren, and there was 
nothing as far as the eye could see. I heard footsteps approaching me, 
and two people appeared. It was Rikku and Yuna. 

&quot;Yuna! Rikku! What are you doing here?&quot; I called to them, running to 
meet them. Both, however, remained silent. There was something in both 
their eyes, something which I could not define. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked them softly. 

&quot;Sometimes love.&quot; Yuna began. 

&quot;.can come from more then one place.&quot; Rikku finished, &quot;But that does not 
mean...&quot; 

&quot;. That it is any less strong. You have two who love you.&quot; Yuna 
continued. 

&quot;But one you do not see. You love two, yet.&quot; Rikku said with a weak 
smile. 

&quot;.You do not realize it. Tell her.&quot; 

&quot;.Before it is too late.&quot; Rikku said, and with that they both turned and 
walked away. I stood there, speechless, and I closed my eyes to think a 
moment, and when I next opened them. 

I had gazed up into Yuna&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;We must find her.&quot; I said, and Yuna nodded. We both ran back to camp, 
and I searched around for Rikku. I could not find her. 

&quot;Oh, Rikku.&quot; I said, as I slid down the base of the tree which Rikku sat 
on, not realizing that Rikku could hear me, &quot;Where can you be? I need to 
tell you, that I love you, just as I love Yuna. One can love more then 
one person, and I do. Oh, Rikku, Where are you?&quot; I gazed around sadly. 
Yuna wrapped her arms around my waist, and I held her tight, not trying 
not to cry. 

&quot;What!?!&quot; I heard a voice say above me, and I heard something fall out 
of the tree, and fall to the ground behind me. &quot;Oww. stupid tree.&quot; Rikku 
said, rubbing her smarting bottom. 

&quot;Rikku! I need to tell you something.&quot; I began, before Rikku held one 
finger to my lips. 

&quot;That you love me, I heard. I love you too Ty, I have for a long time.&quot; 
With that, she joined Yuna in hugging my midsection, and they both 
sighed contentedly. I kissed Rikku tenderly, savoring the moment. Yuna 
kissed Rikku when we broke apart, and fell asleep that way, locked in 
each others arms. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

*they all stare in such amazement, as if it was such a surprise.* Lulu 
thought, as she shook her head at the dense males. &quot;Come on, it&#39;s not 
that surprising.&quot; 

&quot;I thought it was be Yuna and Tidus, never occurred to me that Rikku 
would join the picture.&quot; Wakka said, his mouth hanging there. 

&quot;Sometimes, the more, the merrier.&quot; Lulu said, a small smile playing 
with the corner of her mouth. *Too bad I can&#39;t join them.* Lulu thought, 
as all the males of the group slowly accepted the idea, and settled down 
into the woods. 

End 

(or is it?) 

*authors note: there finished. I may continue on, depending on comments 
I get, and whether I feel like it. </pre>
