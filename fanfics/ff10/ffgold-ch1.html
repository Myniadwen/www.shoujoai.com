<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/spiralingfaith.html">Spiraling Faith</a><br> </h2>
<pre>         Yuffie neared the entrance of the cave that she found south 
of Wutai.  She grinned widely in optimism of possibly finding 
&#147;Materia&#148; here.  

         She was wearing here usual tight green, shoulder cut, shirt 
that showed her belly.  Over it was the armor she always wore on her 
left arm.  On her legs where tight tan jean shorts which where 
unbuttoned but still fit her tightly.  Threw her short brown hair a 
black ribbon was tied.

         Yuffie had lost a lot of weight, which she didn&#146;t have, since 
traveling with the heroes of the planet.  The only way she had money 
to get food was the few &#147;Materia&#148; she had found and sold for little 
money.  

         Her stomach let out a loud hungry groan. She looked down and 
put her left hand on her stomach and rubbed before entering the cave.  

         After an hour in the cave she had found one &#147;Materia&#148; that 
was small and yellow, which she pocketed instantly.  She walked a 
little further down a passage until she couldn&#146;t see anymore. &#147;Damn&#148; 
she yelled into the darkness.  As the words bounced off the walls she 
kicked the floor.  &#147;Better go back,&#148; she whispered. As she turned she 
heard a noise from below her.  She stopped and listened as the noise 
grew.  Finally it stopped.  She looked around curiously, expecting a 
monster to attack.  Then, suddenly the floor beneath her crumbled 
completely and she fell down into the hole. After a long fall she 
landed on the hard ground and collapsed.  

------------------------------------------------------------

         Rikku walked threw the hot sand.  With every step of her foot 
sand was thrown into the air.  

         She wore her sleeveless orange top that stop right above her 
navel.  A loose belt was wrapped around her tight green short shorts 
with frills at the bottom.  On her left hand she wore a regular tan 
glove that goes up to her elbow and on her right arm she has a claw 
and sleeve that runs up her arm and stops at her triceps.  On her back 
hang down two long blue ribbons that stop at her knees. Around her 
neck hang her customary goggles.   Her neck length blonde hair is 
messily tied up.

         She walked through the desert looking for a sign that would 
lead her to where &#147;Home&#148; used to be, and where the &#147;Al Bhed&#148; are 
currently under construction of the towns renewal.  &#147;Man it sure is 
hot&#148; Rikku whined, well whipping her head free of sweat that was 
moving towards her eyes.  
         
         She slowly trudged on threw the sand.  Leaving footprints 
behind her.  Why did they have to live in a desert?  She toke one more 
step then her legs gave out and she fell to the ground.  &#147;Too hot&#148; she 
whispered tiredly.  After laying on the hot ground for about three 
minutes the sand below her crumbled and she fell into a pit, which led 
directly into water.  Once she hit the water her energy was renewed.  
She went under the water the came back up.  

         &#147;Wow, that was just what I needed,&#148; She said loudly as she 
scanned the area for a way out.  As she looked around nothing stood 
out at first.  It looked like the average cave, only filled with a 
large swimming pool.  Suddenly something reflected the sun&#146;s light 
into her eyes.  &#147;That&#146;s bright,&#148; she said starting to move towards it.

         It was a large metallic ball with strange symbols on it. 
Rikku reached out and touched one of the symbols.  The symbol looked 
like an O with little lines on the sides that are pointing in. 
Suddenly the symbol began to glow with a rainbow color.  The light 
filled the room then she finished into a dark blue world.  

------------------------------------------------------------

         Selphie walked into her room and collapsed onto her bed. She 
slid out of her yellow dress and boots while still staying on the bed.  
After wards she covered her self, and fell into a world of sleep.  

         A loud howl filled the empty corridors of the Garden. Selphie 
crawled out of here bed and quickly put on her seed uniform.  She ran 
out of her bedroom.  

         After she ran out of her room and to the made it to the 
elevator she went down stairs.  The elevator stopped and it&#146;s doors 
moved to the sides and she ran out.  In the middle of the hallway that 
led out of the Garden stood a large wolf with electricity coursing 
from it&#146;s body.  In front of the wolf stood Squall in his black coat 
with the feathers and jeans.  In his right hand he held his gunblade 
and was pointing it at the wolf. 

         &#147;Squall,&#148; Selphie yelled while running to him &#147;, is it a GF?&#148;

         &#147;NO&#148; Squall said simply without turning at all.  The wolf 
howled loudly and lighting shot out from his body.  Selphie jumped 
back quickly while Squall stood with electricity flowing around him.

         &#147;What is it?&#148;

         Squall charge it and struck it pulling the trigger in mid- 
swing.  A large boom fills the halls and smoke flowed from his sword.  
The wolf flew a few feet then landed and slid. &#147;I don&#146;t know!&#148; he said 
reloading his gun blade.  

         The wolf stood and let out a very loud roar, which shot a lot 
of lighting around the room.  &#147;Squall watch out.&#148;  But it was to late 
the wolf had pinned him to the floor.  After another roar the room 
went completely black.  

------------------------------------------------------------

         Yuffie stood up and shook some sand from her hair.  She 
looked around to find out where she was.  Around her were sand, and a 
lot of it.  She turned to observe what was behind her.  A lush forest 
was behind her and around everything else, as far as she could see was 
water.  

         &#147;Hmm, this is strange where is the cave&#148; she said turning 
around.  She stopped and looked back into the forest.  &#147;Guess I can 
find shelter there&#148; she said with her hand on her chin, then began 
walking in.  She walked for a while then came across a body.  The body 
was in a tight orange shirt and green shorts. 

         &#147;What is this,&#148; she said kneeling down and putting her hands 
on her knees &#147;, Hmm, blond hair, loose belt, kinda cute to.&#148; 

         &#147;Hey aren&#146;t you a girl?&#148; a female voice rang from behind her.  
Yuffie turned to find a young looking girl in a black suit and skirt.  

         &#147;W-who are you?&#148;

         &#147;The name is Selphie, and you are.&#148; 

         Yuffie smiled and pointed at her self,&#148; I am the &#147;Great 
Ninja&#148; Yuffie,&#148; she said loudly.  &#147;Hey, I gotta question.&#148;  

         &#147;Hmm?&#148;

         &#147;Why did you ask if I was a girl?&#148; Yuffie asked with pure 
curiosity.

         &#147;Well didn&#146;t you say she was cute?&#148;

         &#147;Yeah, so!?&#148; Questioned Yuffie as she threw her arms around 
in the air.   Selphie just shrugged and walked over to the young 
blond.  She grabbed her left arm and tried to pick her up with very 
little success.  &#147;Need a hand,&#148; Yuffie asked, putting her right hand 
on the back of her head.  Selphie just tried to pick up the girl.  
Yuffie ran over and grabbed the unconscious woman&#146;s other arm.  After 
some work they finally got the girl up in the air. &#147;Where are we going 
to take her?&#148; asked Yuffie attempting not to drop her.  

         &#147;There is a cave a little away&#148; Selphie said pointing what 
she thought was north, &#147;think you can hold her?&#148;

         Yuffie hoisted the girl higher and made the &#147;Humph&#148; sound 
&#147;What is that apposed ta mean?&#148; She yelled as if Selphie had said she 
was ugly or something to the same effect.

         &#147;You are just a little skinny, that&#146;s all.&#148;

         &#147;Lets just go&#148; Yuffie yelled taking a few steps forward, 
dragging Selphie with her.  They walked to the cave in about thirty- 
minutes and only dropped the girl about three times.  She didn&#146;t get 
much damage done from being dropped.  Her face got bruised a little, 
but that&#146;s all.  

         After they had got to the cave they decided to start a fire. 
Yuffie stayed behind to protect the knocked out girl, while Selphie 
went off to get some wood.  

         &#147;I&#146;m back,&#148; said Selphie as she entered the cave with some 
wood.  &#147;Now how are we going to start the fire?&#148; she asked putting the 
wood down.

         &#147;Hmm&#148; Yuffie hummed deep in thought.  &#147;Got it just stack the 
wood next to her&#148; commanded Yuffie while she made her way over to the 
blond girl.  Selphie started stacking the wood, and &#147;The Great Ninja&#148; 
moved the girl over, not to far from where the fire would be, but not 
to close to get burned.  

         &#147;Stacked!&#146; Selphie said jumping up and down.  Yuffie walked 
over and inspected it.  &#147;Not bad huh&#148; asked Selphie, who was still 
jumping and cheering over her amazing stacking skills.

         &#147;Not bad&#148; Yuffie stated with her hand now on her chin &#147; not 
as good as I could doooo, but not bad.&#148;  She reached her hand into her 
small tan pockets.  &#147;Now its my turn&#148; She said pulling a small green 
&#147;marble&#148; out of her pocket.  Yuffie closed it into her hands and 
focused all of her energy on it.  A small spark jumped out of her 
hands and lit the wood on fire.  After a little time the fire grew to 
where it could actually give off heat.  

         &#145;Wow, what was that&#148; Selphie asked with her jaw hang down.

         &#147;Called &#147;Materia&#148;, this is the only one of my original 
stashed I ain&#146;t soled&#148; Yuffie said.  Now remembering where she was 
last she also remembered her hunger and began to hold her stomach.

         &#147;Hey, you okay&#148; Yelled Selphie as she ran over to Yuffie.</pre>
