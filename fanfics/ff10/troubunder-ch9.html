<a href="../ff10/troubunder-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The Silent Beyond

The higher-ups called it &#39;Operation Djose.&#39; Lucil called it an exercise 
in futility. They were supposed to investigate an &#39;influx of fiends&#39; 
near headquarters. The meeting with Kehni still replayed in her mind, 
however, and she seriously doubted that this was a simple fiend 
extermination. The boy had been devastated, and quite obviously 
distressed, but people did not lie about Sin, and any Chocobo Knight 
(especially one previously under her command, she admitted with no small 
amount of pride) would have been able to easily dispatch of any ordinary 
fiend.

Now was not the time to wonder about such things, however, and so Lucil 
focused her attention on the young men and women accompanying her on 
this thus far uneventful boat ride. A few of the other officers sat 
chatting with one another, but most of the soldiers were silent, somber. 
It made an odd little chill go up her spine, so she instead decided to 
check up on Elma. The girl was currently doubled over the railing of the 
ship, more than likely divesting herself of her lunch. Lucil winced. She 
had no idea Elma got seasick. After a moment of thought, Lucil made her 
way to Elma&#39;s side, tapping the girl on the shoulder. Elma hiccupped a 
bit, groaning under her breath as she regarded her Captain blearily.

&quot;...Ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Hello, Elma. Seasick?&quot;

&quot;Yes Captain. Very much so...&quot; Elma&#39;s head dipped back down, as if to 
prove her point. Lucil gave her a sympathetic pat on the shoulder, 
resting her arms on the railing.

&quot;I had a friend once, who had the worst case of motion sickness. The 
poor girl could barely stand up half of the time...she hated traveling 
by sea. She did have a couple of things she did though, that took her 
mind off of it.&quot;

&quot;What did she do, Captain?&quot;

&quot;First, she&#39;d walk around quite a bit, stay in open spaces. The second 
thing she&#39;d do was suck on hard candy. She preferred mints. Ah, and ice 
as well, though ice was something she was only able to get during 
missions to Macalania. We had an...agreement of sorts, that I would be 
able to tease her for being a landlubber, so long as I kept plenty of 
mints at hand. I never really broke the habit, though I can&#39;t stand mint 
myself. Here you are,&quot; she murmured, handing Elma a small piece of 
candy. &quot;Maybe it will help a bit.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Captain!&quot; Elma popped the candy into her mouth, sitting up 
for a moment. Lucil stared up at the sky. They were nearing 
headquarters; she could tell. It was never sunny in Djose, and now 
thick, heavy clouds gathered overhead. It would rain, more than likely, 
and the young Captain frowned as she imagined how difficult it would be 
to traverse the terrain. They had some chocobos, but not nearly enough, 
and fighting on foot would be dangerous. She sighed inwardly. She 
admitted to herself that she had been going through battle plans almost 
obsessively, but she found it difficult to relax. Kehni&#39;s mention of Sin 
still bothered her, and she would not be satiated until she saw proof of 
it herself. She did not fancy herself an optimistic fool, but she 
thought it was best to take caution when dealing with rumors of Sin&#39;s 
return. The Crusaders stationed in Besaid had been able to quell the 
questions which erupted after Reia arrived, dressed in Bevellese garb. 
The girl never seemed to slack when it came to formalities, and for once 
Lucil had been displeased by it. She had stuck out like a sore thumb, 
and it was no wonder the peaceful island village had erupted at her 
visit. They had quieted down when the younger captain made her exit, but 
Lucil could feel the unease coming off the villagers in waves, and had 
eventually told Elma, Clasko, and the Crusaders to pack up and prepare 
to leave for headquarters. It would do no good if people started to 
worry. There were rarely visitors in Besaid, but even one mainlander 
catching wind of Reia&#39;s visit would have all of Spira in an uproar. They 
did not need that, not at all, and Lucil did not want to be responsible 
for such chaos. Though the Chocobo Knights were an elite squadron, they 
were still simply a branch of the Crusaders, and lately, with the 
steadily growing use of machina weapons, Crusaders were hardly 
appreciated. There had even been talk of excommunication, and that 
thought unnerved Lucil even more than Sin. Without Yevon, Crusaders and 
Chocobo Knights alike would have no outside support, and the group would 
dissolve all too quickly, leaving only branded heretics in its wake.

Shaking off the uncomfortable thoughts, she instead turned her attention 
to Elma. Lucil was hardly oblivious; she knew very well that Elma&#39;s 
devotion went a bit further than that of a soldier and her superior, but 
she tried her best to dissuade it. Though same-sex relations were not 
viewed with extreme disgust, they were generally frowned upon, and with 
Elma being her subordinate, that made things even worse. She had done 
her best to distance herself from the younger woman, but she did 
genuinely enjoy the company, and if not for her rank and duty, she would 
be more than happy to pursue a relationship with the girl. Lucil was 
fairly good at distancing herself, however, and this was no exception. 
Elma would eventually move on and find someone more appropriate. It 
would do no good to allow such a thing to continue, and Lucil 
reluctantly admitted that she might have to go about pushing her away, 
perhaps even relocate her. The thought made her uneasy. She had been 
with Elma so long that she could not imagine being without her company, 
her cheerful exuberance. She shook her head. She had become too 
attached. At the end of this battle, she would gently break the news to 
Elma, have her relocated, and her troubles would be over. She spared a 
glance at her subordinate, noting that some of the color had returned to 
her face. She always seemed so very young, and small, even though Lucil 
knew that beneath that childlike naivet&#130; lay a fine soldier, one she had 
trained. She felt an odd, frightening surge of warmth, and cleared her 
throat.

&quot;Would you like to take a walk around the deck, Elma? Perhaps it&#39;ll 
clear your head.&quot;

&quot;Umm...I&#39;d like that very much, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Since Elma would be leaving her soon, she rationalized, it would do 
little harm to spend a bit more time with her while she was around.

----------

Elma had to admit that walking around helped a little bit. The Captain 
was oddly talkative today, and Elma got the odd feeling that she was on 
edge about the mission. Elma couldn&#39;t blame her though, after what they 
had seen. Poor Kehni, he had looked so...broken. Elma had never seen a 
grown man openly sob, and even Reia had been shaken. She hoped more than 
anything that Sin had not returned, but as they neared Djose, 
predictions became far bleaker. Even the sea had been fairly silent, and 
Elma found that it was impossible to search for answers in its murky 
depths. She wondered what would await them on Djose&#39;s shores.

Was Sin really alive? She could not fathom it. Ten years had come and 
gone, and she had stumbled out of adolescence and into womanhood with 
only the memory of sinspawn, of attacks on Kilika, the screams of the 
villagers and the tears that came afterward, the wailing of the 
pyreflies, iridescent and fragile as they began their ascent into the 
Farplane. For the past ten years, she had only worried about the 
occasional fiend attack and whether or not her Captain would catch on, 
if Clasko would be alright traversing the fiend-infested paths in Besaid 
alone with only their chocobos as company. Sin seemed oddly distant to 
her, like a nightmare she had a long time ago. But when she heard 
Lucil&#39;s strained laughter, watched the way her hands made nervous 
gestures in the air, as if to punctuate each word she said, she realized 
that the possibility was very real.

She was a bit disappointed that Tyhlan would not be accompanying them in 
this mission. Macalania was too far away, and when they had spoken 
before, a few weeks back, the Al Bhed had mentioned most of the soldiers 
there had been dispatched to Bevelle, more than likely to escort Maester 
Mika. She had asked the girl how she felt about being in Yevon&#39;s 
capital, and the blonde had simply shrugged it off. She had been far 
more easygoing than before, which was quite a feat, considering Tyhlan&#39;s 
personality. It seemed that her time in Macalania had given her time to 
grow, and Elma was unsure as to how she felt about this oddly mature 
Tyhlan. The girl had always been clever, but she had a new, quiet wisdom 
about herself. It was a little weird, but...she seemed peaceful. All the 
fire of teenage youth had dimmed, and in its place a woman had emerged. 
Elma felt an odd pang of envy; her friend had changed so much! Even her 
speech had become more polished; more than likely a result of her time 
in Macalania with all of those Bevellese soldiers.

&quot;You have to learn how to deal with situations that might not be your 
ideal, Elma. It isn&#39;t so bad, really. No one gives me any trouble; only 
a few people even know I&#39;m half Al-Bhed, in fact. I knew what I was 
getting into when I joined the Knights. Besides,&quot; and then her smile 
turned wistful, &quot;I have someone to keep me company.&quot;

Elma had not heard such warmth in her friend&#39;s voice in a very long 
time, but before she could ask who this &#39;someone&#39; was, Tyhlan had 
quickly skirted over the subject.

Elma still wanted to know how she managed to keep any and all attention 
off her love life. She certainly gave Elma a lot of grief over hers.

Even though she missed her friend, as she watched the shores of Djose 
slowly grow closer, she was a bit happy the girl was relatively safe in 
Spira&#39;s capital. Elma wasn&#39;t sure she could say the same about herself. 
The other ship goers had become oddly silent, and Elma watched the 
warmth in Lucil&#39;s eyes fade away to nothing. Hands checked weaponry and 
armor, people looked over one another. Even the younger soldiers had 
ceased their chatting, instead making sure that their odd machina guns 
were working correctly. An &#39;in and out&#39; mission, they had said, but Elma 
wasn&#39;t so sure anymore. It seemed far too silent, foreboding.

When the ship finally arrived at Djose, the group of soldiers exited as 
if they were a funeral procession, and Elma put a hand on the hilt of 
her sword as she tried to swallow down the nervous beating of fear 
inside of her.

----------

Lucil ordered the soldiers to pan out across the area, directing the 
snipers to stay back and the swordsmen to join her on the front lines. 
There was not a fiend to be found, and she felt confusion become 
replaced by a cold realization.

Sin was here.

Of course, she could not see it, but she knew it lurked deep within the 
sea, waiting for the moment where it would unleash its hellish sinspawn 
on all of them. She would order a retreat, but Djose Temple was too 
close for comfort, and she would rather die than allow a place of 
worship to be destroyed by that hideous beast. Bolstered by this, she 
calmly ordered her troops to wait, ignoring their various looks of 
confusion and impatience. Her chocobo shuffled uneasily beneath her, and 
she had no doubt that the mount more than likely sensed the coming of 
Sin. Elma was at her side as always, and her dark eyes held a steely 
resolve that Lucil had never seen before. She knew Sin was out there as 
well, and Lucil resisted the urge to tell the girl to fall back. No 
doubt her subordinate would cause a ruckus, and arguing with her would 
not serve to improve her troops&#39; morale. A tall young man with pale skin 
and hair as deep auburn as her own moved to her side. His voice was very 
calm, and she realized she recognized him immediately. He was of distant 
relation to her, but she had never really looked too deeply into 
discovering her family history. By the time she had joined the Knights, 
it seemed to be a futile gesture, and she had simply forgotten.

&quot;Lucil,&quot; he murmured softly, staring off into the distance. Lucil caught 
Elma&#39;s look of surprise, as if amazed that the man would refer to her by 
her first name only.

&quot;Luzzu,&quot; she responded frostily. &quot;I assume you have forgotten that I am 
indeed higher in rank than you are.&quot; At his slightly hurt look, her 
voice softened. &quot;I would appreciate it if you referred to me by my title 
in the presence of my lieutenant.&quot; She spared a passing glance to Elma.

&quot;Ah. I apologize then, Captain. Should we perhaps fall back? There seems 
to be nothing to report...&quot; his eyes narrowed suddenly, and Lucil 
followed his gaze, moving her chocobo back a few steps.

Something dark moved beneath the water, and she felt the hair rise on 
the back of her neck as the sky was replaced by a familiar, writhing 
black mass.

&quot;Sin!&quot; she heard someone scream before deluges of water crashed down 
against the shore. Sinspawn squirmed and crawled out of the sea&#39;s murky 
depths, and the snipers wasted no time in pelting them with bullets as 
the soldiers on the front line tore through tentacles and hard shells 
with their swords. Soon the sickly smell of Sin&#39;s toxin and blood filled 
the air, and Lucil watched the first, lone pyrefly wail up into the 
heavens. The sinspawn came in waves, mandibles and sharp teeth clicking 
as they tore into delicate human flesh. She saw one man&#39;s legs literally 
get pulled from under him as he was covered by the writhing beasts.

&quot;Fall back!&quot; she screamed, slashing into whatever sinspawn she could 
see. Her chocobo deftly avoided the creatures, but she could feel that 
the bird was quickly losing strength; soon exhaustion would roll in and 
the beast would be nothing more than a meal for the disgusting spawn 
beneath them. The battlefield was in a state of complete and utter 
chaos, and the sounds of anguished screams sounded faint as blood rushed 
in her ears. She had realized, belatedly, that Elma was no longer by her 
side. Steering her chocobo forward, she resisted the urge to scream as a 
strangled garble escaped the bird&#39;s throat. The sinspawn had gained hold 
of him, and she cringed at the smell of burning feathers and blood as 
one of the spawn scrambled up her chocobo&#39;s body, acrid poison dripping 
from its maws. The chocobo bucked wildly, and she could no longer 
control it, tipping backward and slamming her head against the hard 
ground. Stars dotted her vision as she stood to her feet, watching with 
disgust as her steed was swallowed up by the pulsating bodies of the 
spawn. She had no time to waste, however. She did not know how long she 
fought, but the smell of Sin&#39;s toxin filled her nose and throat, making 
her vision hazy. She slashed through countless Sinspawn, so much so that 
her arms and legs burned from running, from the repetitive movement of 
her sword rising and falling to rip the creatures asunder. She had to 
find Elma before she collapsed. Her armor had been all but torn from her 
body, burned away by spitting poison, and numerous lacerations and cuts 
marred her skin. She realized in an instant that she was about to pass 
out. Her vision weaved in and out unsteadily, and the toxin made her 
dizzy and weak, but she forced herself to stand upright.

I am Lucil of the Chocobo Knights, I am Captain Lucil, I will not be 
felled by simple toxin, I will not die today, I will push forward. I 
will not die...

She felt a rush of air at her back, and realized with a sudden, sick 
clarity that Sin was charging, preparing to shoot some form of energy 
down at the battlefield. There would be nothing left but blackened 
corpses, and she felt panic take over. Where was Elma? She had to find 
her, she had to figure out where she was. She could barely see anything, 
however, only the blurred images of countless soldiers fighting and 
dying. Sin had returned. It was back, and there was no stopping it.

She felt her vision become seared with white at the sides as Sin 
unleashed its deadly attack, and then everything fell into darkness.

----------

She had to be dead. She could hear the moans and wails of the pyreflies 
in the distance, and came to the conclusion that she must be in the 
Farplane.

But if she was in the Farplane, why did everything hurt so much? Elma 
groaned, fighting off a wave of nausea as the smell of blood and toxin 
filled her nostrils. Her vision filled up with painful, blinding white 
before it dimmed, and she felt her jaw drop of its own accord as she 
observed the carnage that lay in front of her eyes.

There were dead bodies everywhere, as far as the eye could see. Some had 
kept all of their limbs; others were not so lucky. Elma turned and 
realized she could not move. She glanced around and realized her body 
was pinned by a dead soldier&#39;s own. Eyes clouded by death glanced down 
blankly at her, and she noted a gruesome, horizontal scar across his 
neck. She could see where the Sinspawn had tore out his throat, and all 
that was left was congealing, brown-red blood and an empty, gaping hole. 
Elma shrieked and pushed the dead man off of her, standing to her feet 
and then immediately falling to her knees as nausea won over. She 
retched violently, gagging as the smell of death snared her senses, the 
cloying scent of blood and toxin creating another wave of nausea. She 
staggered to her feet again, stumbling blindly over dead bodies and 
batting away pyreflies as she searched.

She had no idea what she was searching for, really. It would be a 
miracle if Clasko had lived, she thought regretfully, and the Captain...

Oh no...

Elma scanned the battlefield, searching for Lucil frantically. 
&quot;Captain!&quot; she screamed, cupping her hands around her mouth as she 
called out. &quot;Captain Lucil! Captain!&quot;

&quot;Elma?&quot; she heard a voice call back in response, and she turned to see a 
very pale Clasko running over to her. His face was covered in blood, and 
Elma hoped it was not his own. &quot;Elma!&quot; The man gave his comrade a hug, 
sobbing into her shoulder guard. &quot;Yevon, Elma! I thought you were dead!&quot; 
She patted Clasko on his head, noticing with some dry amusement that he 
was a bit shorter than her. How he had survived this...travesty was 
beyond her, but she was beginning to think that Clasko was either very 
blessed or very clever. She had her gil on the former.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Clasko, don&#39;t worry.&quot; She gave him another pat, as if to 
prove to him that she was indeed alive, and then returned her attention 
to the battlefield, shaking her head sadly. &quot;Clasko...have you seen the 
Captain?&quot;

&quot;No...no! Not at all! Oh no, what if something happened to her? What are 
we gonna do, Elma?&quot;

&quot;Nothing happened to the Captain,&quot; Elma said, more to convince herself 
than Clasko. &quot;We&#39;ll search every body here until we manage to find her.&quot; 
She gulped, shaking down another quell of nausea. &quot;Even if it takes all 
night.&quot;

Clasko paled considerably.

----------

Yevon help her, for she had never been in so much pain. Lucil&#39;s skull 
felt as if it were made of stone, and her chest and legs burned 
painfully. She tried to open her eyes, but even that caused an 
uncomfortable stab of pain to move through her, so she instead remained 
still. She wondered if she had been blinded. How unfortunate that would 
be. Perhaps she was dying, but she doubted that. Her breath came out in 
painful rattles, and she could feel her lungs struggle to gather the 
needed amount of air. Sin&#39;s toxin still burned her nostrils, and the 
throbbing in her head increased tenfold when she realized she could not 
seem to take a breath of fresh air.

She heard sounds near her, and assumed it was the sinspawn coming to 
finish her off. Her body tensed, and then she simply relaxed. What was 
the point of fighting them now? It would do nothing; she was going to 
die anyway. She tried to laugh, but that caused an unbelievable amount 
of pain as well, so instead she satisfied herself with listening to the 
blood pound in her ears and her odd, irregular breathing.

&quot;Captain!&quot; she heard someone cry out. The noise was akin to a thousand 
needles being stabbed into her temples.

&quot;Oh Yevon,&quot; another voice murmured. This one was softer, and she was 
rather grateful that it didn&#39;t have the keening whine of the first. 
&quot;Captain, can you get up?&quot;

She felt a rush of clarity hit her. Elma... She forced herself to speak, 
ignoring the rattling in her chest. &quot;I...cannot...can 
barely...breathe...&quot;

Elma shushed her gently, kneeling down to run slender fingers through 
her hair. Normally, she would not allow Elma to coddle her in such a 
way; it was highly unprofessional, but she could not muster up the 
strength to care. The caress was oddly soothing, and took some of the 
edge off of the white-hot pain that raced through her. &quot;You have to 
relax, Captain...Clasko and I are going to take you to Djose Temple, 
alright? We&#39;ll see if someone can heal you.&quot;

Lucil sighed in relief, remembering why she had Elma as her subordinate. 
The woman was beyond capable. &quot;...Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk.&quot; Elma was helping her to her feet, and Clasko, in an odd 
display of strength, took her from Elma, carrying most of her weight on 
his own. She knew that Elma had told her not to talk, but she felt she 
had to say something before she passed out.

&quot;I...Elma...I am happy you&#39;re...alright.&quot;

She caught a flash of the girl&#39;s smile, then she mercifully slipped into 
unconsciousness. She had a fleeting thought of assigning Elma somewhere 
else, and then decided that the idea was simply idiotic. She was no 
bumbling teenager; she could control her affections toward the girl and 
still be rewarded with her presence.

Besides, she thought drowsily, she has proved her worth in battle 
today...it would simply not do to have an esteemed soldier reassigned in 
the boondocks somewhere...Elma will stay by my side.
