<pre>	&#147;Ahhh!&#148; Rikku screamed into the dead of night as a flash of 
lightning and the dull roar of thunder sounded in the distance. 
Gripping at her bed sheets the blonde Al-Bhed whimpered into the total 
darkness of her room as the noises crept into her bittersweet dreams.
	&#147;Rikku! Rikku wake up you are having a nightmare.&#148; A soft voice 
murmured with sleep still hanging on the edges as the person spoke, 
dancing on the verge of consciousness the blonde girl cried out and 
blindly clung onto anything in arms length. Gently a luminous ivory 
hand carefully stroked the young woman&#146;s tresses behind a small ear. 
The sudden warmth of the touch slowly roused the young Al-Bhed from 
her sleep, looking up with tears hanging on her now paled cheeks Rikku 
tightened her grasp on the person she sought out in the dark.
	&#147;Lulu, syga ed ku yfyo! Syga ed cdub, bmayca! &#148; Rikku sobbed as 
a crack of thunder boomed overhead, with a soft sigh the black mage 
stroked the young girl&#146;s hair and gently sat down on the edge of the 
Al-bhed&#146;s bed. Almost instantly Rikku crawled into Lulu&#146;s lap resting 
her head on the older woman&#146;s thigh, and tightly wrapping her thin 
arms around the sorceress&#146;s waist. 
	&#147;Shush now, everything will be alright, I&#146;m here now so there is 
nothing to worry about.&#148; Lulu murmured tenderly as she comforted the 
girl in her lap, Rikku slowly worked herself into frantic hiccups as 
she tried to stop crying but only succeeded in making herself 
hyperventilate. Shaking long black locks of braided hair Lulu sighed 
as her never ending patience kicked into overdrive, carefully the 
black mage worked Rikku&#146;s grip loose from her waist and slowly slid 
into the bed beside the younger girl. Sniffling lightly the blonde 
Al-Bhed reclaimed Lulu&#146;s waist and tightly drew the older woman close 
to her small body for both comfort and warmth both of which she was 
lacking at the moment, and instinctively interlocked her long legs 
with at Lulu&#146;s. A pleased shocked look fell over the older woman&#146;s 
face for a slip second before she felt Rikku shiver with fear as blast 
of lightning lit up the room with an ominous glow through the window 
shades, cradling the young blonde Lulu slowly felt herself hum the 
Hymn of the Faith, after a few moments Rikku laid still in Lulu&#146;s arms 
every once and a while she rubbed her cheek in the crook of the older 
woman&#146;s neck. Deathlike silence filled the air for long minutes as the 
two just held each other, slowly in a weak voice Rikku spoke out 
timidly.
	&#147;Lulu,&#148; Breathed the Al-Bhed as she looked up and into her 
friend&#146;s deep red eyes. &#147;Why, why do you always come when I cry at 
night? I know I am a big baby because I am still scared of thunder and 
lightning, but why do you always come and help me?&#148; Inquired Rikku as 
she let her eyes lower again; Lulu gave the young girl a reserved 
smile, one that was both soft and unfamiliarly warm to the sorceress. 
	&#147;Its because&#133;&#148; Lulu took a deep breath to calm her own nerves. 
&#147;I have nightmares too and I know that sometimes it is easier if you 
have someone there. Just to hold you and to tell you it&#146;s alright.&#148; 
Stated the black mage in a low voice as she downcast her line of 
vision so she was looking at Rikku&#146;s childlike face, shyly the young 
Al-Bhed smiled as she suddenly felt her cheeks begin to grow flushed. 
	&#147;Um, Lulu, could you&#133;&#148; Rikku stopped herself from going any 
further with what she was going to ask but the mistress of the blacks 
arts wouldn&#146;t have for half asked questions. 
	&#147;Could I what? Go on tell me what it is you wish to know.&#148; Lulu 
encouraged as she gave the smaller guardian a sweet soft half smile, 
Rikku nodded numbly and licked her lips to try and stop her mouth from 
feeling like cotton. 
	&#147;Could you teacher me&#133;how&#133;ya know. To use magic.&#148; Stuttered the 
Al-Bhed as her insides twisted into a knot at the base of her abdomen, 
Lulu gave a small laugh that reminded Rikku of a whispered secrete 
that you over hear but you aren&#146;t supposed to know but since you do 
the only thing you can think of is how guilty it make you feel. The 
black mage brushed a strand of sandy blonde hair away from the young 
girl&#146;s eyes so she could look into them better, a sudden crash of 
thunder made Rikku yelp and tighten her grip on the older woman.
	&#147;Why do you wish to learn the dark arts so suddenly?&#148; Inquired 
the ebony haired witch as she looked at the younger guardian with a 
curious stare; Rikku flinched slightly at the interrogation from the 
older woman but then sighed and leaned in closer to the tall mage&#146;s 
protective embrace. 
	&#147;I want to learn because, I want to be more like you. Mature, 
strong, confident, respected by everyone. And I think if I were to 
learn how to cast lightning spells, maybe then I wouldn&#146;t be so 
scared&#133;maybe.&#148; Rikku&#146;s voice wavered as she finished her sentence and 
Lulu noticed that she sounded like a small child who&#146;s just watched 
their puppy get run over by a Shopuff, for some reason the dark haired 
woman frowned by the way Rikku reacted to the heavens cries. Lulu took 
in a deep breath as her fingers gently stroked its way though the 
younger girl&#146;s blonde mane.
	&#147;Rikku I have to ask you a question, and it maybe a little 
prying but I must know for certain, just to ease my own mind if 
nothing else.&#148; Declared Lulu in a serious tone that could have chilled 
even Shiva to the core, Rikku nodded and she shivered from both the 
storm and the older woman&#146;s sudden change in demeanor. 
	&#147;What do you want to know?&#148; Rikku asked as she raised her 
eyebrows questioningly; with a forced soft look Lulu&#146;s forehead 
crinkled in thought before she spoke in a deep voice that startled the 
young girl in her arms.
	&#147;How to word this&#133;Rikku, I can understand that you were 
traumatized at a young age. But something just doesn&#146;t seem right 
about the way you still act. When Lady Yuna was younger she too had a 
great fear of storms, but as she grew older that fear diminished. I 
can remember how she would cry in the middle of the night when the 
thunder would start to boom outside her window, but it is different 
with you Rikku. I hear you crying in your sleep but it doesn&#146;t sound 
like complete fear for just the storm&#133;I swear it sounds like you&#146;re in 
pain. Maybe I am just assuming too much, but perhaps I&#146;m not, Rikku 
did anything else happen to you that day your brother zapped you with 
that spell?&#148; Lulu inquired while she let her hardened gaze meet the 
young guardian&#146;s cool blue eyes, Rikku shook her head confusedly for a 
moment before she stared past Lulu and into the darkness of the room.
	&#147;I&#133;I don&#146;t really remember much after it happened. Its all 
fuzzy, like a bad dream.&#148; The blonde stated with a far away look in 
her eyes, Lulu could feel the younger girl trembling against her body 
as if she were frozen to the morrow of her bones.
	&#147;Could you tell me anything you do remember about it, start at 
the beginning and just walk through the day like you are reliving it.&#148; 
Uttered Lulu encouragingly, for a split second the blonde Al-Bhed&#146;s 
low lip quivered ever so slightly before she shook her head and 
refocused on the older guardian&#146;s pale face.
	&#147;Well, I remember waking up that morning, it was really hot and 
oddly humid for the desert especially for that time of the year. After 
I took a shower dad told brother to take me to the oasis for a swim 
because he and the other men would be busy working on some sort of 
underwater sea craft. After that brother and me went to the oasis,&#148; 
Rikku gave a small giggle as she remembered the day clearly. &#147;We 
played Red light Green light all the way there, I tripped and fell a 
few times and scrapped up my knees pretty bad. I cried and I didn&#146;t 
want to go into the water after that&#133;I told brother the salt in the 
water would make my cuts burn, but he made me go in anyways because he 
said it was too hot to just sit on the sand and sweat. After I gave 
in, well&#133;more like after I was thrown in. I started to have a good 
time, until the fiend showed up. Brother saw it coming before I had a 
chance to swim away, and he&#133;he raised his hand and lightning struck 
the water fiend but the electricity current traveled and zapped me 
too. It gets hazy after that, I just remember brother pulling me on 
the shore and&#133;.&#148; Rikku&#146;s eyes began to tear up slightly and her throat 
closed up making her give a sort of smothered choke, unsure of what 
the young blonde remembered Lulu pulled the petite girl into her arms 
and held her. 
	&#147;What else do you remember Rikku? There is something else isn&#146;t 
there?&#148; Lulu replied half rhetorically; a stuttering sob welled up in 
the back of the young Al-Bhed&#146;s throat as she buried her now ghostly 
white face into Lulu&#146;s overly adequate chest. 
	&#147;I don&#146;t want to remember! No, it didn&#146;t happen like that, I 
must be remembering wrong! Brother would never&#133;ra fuimth&#146;d ryja tuha 
dryd du sa!&#148; Rikku yelled into the fabric of the older woman&#146;s 
nightgown, Lulu narrowed her wine red eyes and spoke out while holding 
onto the young Al-Bhed tenderly. 
	&#147;What wouldn&#146;t he have done to you? Please tell me Rikku, I want 
to help you.&#148; Lulu stated as she translated what the young blonde had 
just rambled out in her native tongue. More confusion set into Rikku&#146;s 
features as she realized Lulu understood what she had unintentionally 
just said in Al-Bhed. 
	&#147;How&#133;&#148; Rikku shook her head causing tears to roll down her 
cheeks and absorb into the older woman&#146;s sleeping clothes. &#147;Lulu, 
brother wouldn&#146;t have done what I remember him doing. He just 
wouldn&#146;t, I know my brother and I know he isn&#146;t like that.&#148; Rikku 
murmured into Lulu&#146;s chest making her voice barely audible, again the 
black mage found the blonde girl&#146;s hair and stroked it comfortingly.
	&#147;What is it that you think he did? You maybe correct in your 
speculation that you are just filling in the blanks with false 
remembrance.&#148; Whispered the ebony haired magic user as emotion 
threatened to spill into her words, Rikku gripped Lulu tighter around 
the waist causing the mage to almost gasp in half pain. 
	&#147;I remember him pulling my shirt off my body leaving me in my 
bra, then&#133;I remember him looking around nervously and telling me to 
relax because he was just checking my injuries. But, that wasn&#146;t what 
he was doing. He unhooked my bra and pulled it off and started to feel 
my chest, he was hurting me&#133;he kept rubbing harder and harder until I 
started to cry and scream because of the pain. Then when I wouldn&#146;t 
stop yelling he slapped me, and then I was quiet I remember that 
because he stopped hitting me. Er&#133;then brother undid his pants and&#133;he 
pulled me so my face was near his&#133;his&#133;private part and he told me to 
open my mouth. So I did and he made me suck it until he yelled at me 
for not doing it right, that is when he got really mad at me. He 
started to slap me again but this time he did it harder and I fought 
back and that just made him even madder, so he started to punch me in 
my stomach. I screamed really loud and told him if he didn&#146;t stop I 
would tell father, brother then got really silent and he looked like 
he was going to kill me. I remember him grabbing me by the throat and 
cutting off my airway, then he told me if I did he would hurt me even 
more and he would hurt dad too. I stopped fighting him, that is when 
he put his hand in my shorts and slid his fingers into my panties, and 
he started to hurt me again&#133;and I don&#146;t know why it hurt but it did, 
and he wouldn&#146;t stop this time! Brother pulled my clothes around my 
ankles and he got on top of me, and he told me to shut up or he would 
make it hurt more than it was going to, and all I remember next was 
whatever he was doing hurt so bad that I started to scream and cry 
again. That is when brother got up and looked at me and told me I was 
worthless and he raised his hand up again and made lightning start to 
strike all around me, and I curled up into a ball on the sand and he 
let the lightning hit me over and over again until I blacked out.&#148; 
Rikku said softly, she didn&#146;t even realize she was crying until Lulu 
wiped away the tears. Blankly bring her dull glazed over eyes to meet 
the older woman&#146;s the young Al-Bhed barely noticed Lulu was crying 
with her. 
	&#147;Rikku, I didn&#146;t know. I thought it was something like that but 
I didn&#146;t think it would be that bad. I&#146;m so sorry, I didn&#146;t mean to 
make you hurt all over again.&#148; Muttered Lulu as wet streaks stained 
her cheeks, Rikku only nuzzled closer to the older woman and cried 
harder into her chest. 
	&#147;Lulu,&#148; Rikku managed to say in breathy sobs that were close to 
being incoherent. &#147;What did he do to me?&#148; She asked in between gasp 
for air, the black mage held onto the shaking girl for dear life, all 
she wanted was to take away all of Rikku&#146;s pain and make her stop 
hurting. Lulu took in a long breath as a sudden wave of rage began to 
swell inside of her.
	&#147;He raped you Rikku, that is what it is called. When someone 
forces you to have sex with them it is called rape, and it is wrong! 
Your brother should be killed on the very spot he stands, people like 
that shouldn&#146;t be allowed to live.&#148; Lulu said as she gritted her teeth 
together but soon regretted every word she said as Rikku began to cry 
harder than Lulu thought possible.
	&#147;I didn&#146;t mean to do anything wrong! Please don&#146;t hate me Lulu, 
please forgive me for being too weak to make him stop&#133;I didn&#146;t know it 
was wrong!&#148; Yelled Rikku as she pushed the older woman away from her 
like she was a Cactuar. &#147;Get out! Please just leave me alone.&#148; The 
young blonde hissed in a upset dry tone that was almost empty of all 
emotion except sorrow and pain, Lulu reached out into the darkness and 
drew Rikku back into her arms even though she was fighting to pull 
away which made it difficult for the sorceress because she lacked 
physical strength.
	&#147;Rikku that isn&#146;t what I meant, you didn&#146;t do anything wrong. 
You are not to blame for anything that happened you were a little girl 
that was taken advantage of by someone you thought would never hurt 
you, I could never hate you no matter what, do you understand what I 
am saying Rikku?&#148; Inquired Lulu as she held the younger girl in her 
arms protectively.
	&#147;I&#146;m still a little girl.&#148; Uttered the Al-Bhed in a voice that 
sounded far off and laced with self loathing, closing her ruby red 
eyes for a moment to collect her spinning thoughts Lulu placed a 
trembling hand against Rikku&#146;s face and tenderly made the younger girl 
look up at her so she could see everything she felt. 
	&#147;You are not a child anymore Rikku, you are a beautiful young 
woman. And I don&#146;t want you to think otherwise; do you understand me? 
You are a talented woman that can do anything you set your mind to, I 
know, I have been watching you mature into who you are now. When I 
first met you I was only thinking in interest of Lady Yuna, but as 
time carried on, I was glad that I gave you a chance to prove yourself 
as both a guardian and as a person.&#148; Lulu declared in a low voice that 
was both soothing and sincere, silence filled the crisp night air as 
Rikku forced herself to stare into the older woman&#146;s deep crimson 
orbs, she had stopped crying for a few brief moments but the blonde 
Al-Bhed still shook with emotion and pain. 
	&#147;Lulu,&#148; Rikku muttered in a soft voice that could barely be 
heard. &#147;Will you sleep with me tonight, I don&#146;t want to be alone, even 
if the storm is almost over, for me it has just begun.&#148; 
	Lulu nodded numbly and slowly began to sing the hymn in a low 
tone just above a whisper in hopes it would lull Rikku into a sound 
peaceful sleep, slowly the young blonde pulled herself as close as she 
could against the black haired mage and in a voice that was twice as 
quiet as Lulu&#146;s she sang the Hymn of the Faith in Al-Bhed. In the 
darkness the two women laid in each other&#146;s arms singing in unison 
with a perfect harmony joining them together. 
	&#147;Have any of you guys seen Lu, I checked her room but she isn&#146;t 
there ya.&#148; Wakka said as he scratched the back of his head and stifled 
a yawn, Yuna looked up at the Blitz Ball player as she took a sip of 
Shopuff milk.
	&#147;Did you check in Rikku&#146;s room?&#148; Inquired the summoner as she 
set her glass down and smiled softy at the tan guardian that stood 
before her in an archway, Wakka looked at Yuna and raised an eyebrow 
in question.
	&#147;Wha chu mean, are you sayin&#146; Lu and the Al-Bhed are closer than 
just comrades, ya?&#148; Wakka ask as his face paled a few shades of white, 
Yuna looked up and giggled.
	&#147;In the name of Yevon, of course I am not implying that Wakka. 
But last night there was a thunder storm and think I heard Lulu trying 
to calm Rikku down, she might have spent the night in her room. You 
know how scared and over dramatic Rikku can get.&#148; Yuna stated as she 
stood up from her seat and slowly walked over to the man from Besaid, 
she smiled lightly and patted Wakka&#146;s shoulder. Sighing the blitz ball 
player slowly walked towards Rikku&#146;s room in hopes that Yuna was wrong 
about Lulu staying with the young Al-Bhed, he didn&#146;t know why but the 
mere thought of it made his blood pump into his ears with anger. As 
Wakka neared the blonde girl&#146;s room he slowed to a stop in front of 
her door and silently listened to what was going on through the other 
side, a few moments pasted by and all he heard was nothingness 
definitely no moaning or any other signs of unnatural acts taking 
place inside. After a few minutes of just standing in the hallway 
Wakka finally managed the courage to push open the door, the sight 
that greeted his eyes enraged the tan guardian to the point that he 
clenched his teeth and falls his large fist. 
	&#147;Get you filthy hands off her you damn Al-Bhed!&#148; Wakka screamed 
startling both Lulu and Rikku out of a deep slumber, the black mage 
glared at Wakka even though she was still half asleep.
	&#147;Go away, can&#146;t you see we are sleeping?&#148; Lulu rumbled in a 
husky tired voice, the stout man from Besaid growled and marched into 
the blonde girl&#146;s room. 
	&#147;How could you, Lu how could you betray Chappu like this? Didn&#146;t 
you love him, ya?&#148; Wakka yelled in ignorance as he neared the bed and 
caused Rikku to shake with fear, Lulu could feel the young Al-Bhed 
shiver against her warm skin, with a protective look in her eyes the 
ebony haired woman took the small blonde into her arms and held her 
defiantly. 
	&#147;Wakka shut up you&#146;re scaring her, just leave us alone and I 
will explain everything to you.&#148; Lulu said as her voice rose in pitch, 
narrowing his eyes Wakka glared at Rikku and then at Lulu.
	&#147;Never thought I would see the day! But here it is, my lil&#146; 
brother&#146;s fianc&eacute;e screwin&#146; an Al-Bhed, ya know you really are a cold 
hearted bitch Lu. I hope you and your lil&#146; girlfriend will be happy 
together, cause I know I sure as hell won&#146;t. Your kind makes me sick!&#148; 
Spat Wakka as he stared right at Rikku before he turned and left the 
room, sitting in silence for a few moments the two women just held 
onto each other, both seeking comfort. Slowly Rikku brushed a tress of 
blonde hair out of her eyes as she look at Lulu, tears were hanging on 
her long lashes and gently began to run down her cheeks and drip off 
her chin. Without so much as a second thought Lulu wiped the younger 
girl&#146;s face off with the back of her soft pale hand. 
	&#147;Don&#146;t heed him any mind Rikku, he just has a hot temper to go 
with is intolerance to things he can&#146;t understand, Wakka has a good 
heart but a thick head.&#148; Whispered Lulu in a soft reassuring voice 
that seemed to fit her the more she used it to comfort the younger 
female, with a wrinkled brow Rikku suddenly looked deep in thought and 
slowly she spoke in a soft voice that was almost hard to hear.
	&#147;What did he mean by screwin&#146;? I don&#146;t understand.&#148; Murmured the 
blonde Al-Bhed as she looked at Lulu confusedly, blinking the black 
haired woman looked at Rikku and went slightly slag-jawed before she 
recomposed herself and spoke. 
	&#147;He meant, having sex.&#148; Lamely replied Lulu as she felt a 
headache coming on, Rikku&#146;s eyes suddenly grew wide with shock and she 
started to lose colour in her face rapidly. 
	&#147;I didn&#146;t rape you! How could he think I would do that to you?&#148; 
Shrieked the blonde thief as she wrapped her arms around a confused 
Lulu.
	&#147;Rikku, you do know what sex is? Rape doesn&#146;t mean the same 
thing as having sex.&#148; Declared Lulu with genuine shock and admiration 
for Rikku&#146;s childlike innocence, in return the younger guardian looked 
down and blushed deeply while shaking her head no. 
	&#147;Err, umm, no one has ever explained those types of concepts to 
me.&#148; Retorted Rikku shyly as she began to pull away from the older 
woman a bit, Lulu was at a loss of words for a few seconds but 
carefully she continued on with the topic at hand.
	&#147;Have you ever kissed anyone Rikku, or are you that sheltered?&#148; 
Lulu asked sincerely while looking at the young girl squirm under this 
line of questioning, Rikku shook her head again and flushed more.
	&#147;No, and even if I wanted to, I wouldn&#146;t know how. I don&#146;t think 
I will ever understand these things Lulu.&#148; Rikku stated in a low voice 
that was somewhere between embarrassed and frustrated, smiling softly 
the pale magic user moved her head so she was eye level with the young 
Al-Bhed. 
	&#147;You will understand them when it is your time to understand 
them. Don&#146;t rush yourself with learning everything at once, some 
things I still don&#146;t completely comprehend so don&#146;t try and take it 
all in before you have to.&#148; Sighed Lulu as she smiled tenderly at the 
blonde, nervously Rikku moved in closer to Lulu as she looked into her 
wine coloured eyes.
	&#147;Lulu?&#148; She choked out as her voice cracked slightly, raising a 
slender eyebrow the black haired mage looked into Rikku&#146;s soft hues 
that were like a cool whorl pool spinning into eternity. The invisible 
lump in the back of her throat made it difficult for Lulu to reply at 
first but after silently clearing her airway of nothingness she spoke 
in a shallow voice.
	&#147;Yes Rikku?&#148; Lulu inquired as a sudden burst of nervousness 
filled her chest and made her heart pound in her ears, the question 
Rikku asked wasn&#146;t spoken in words but rather a bold action that 
shocked them both equally. Rikku awkwardly pressed her lips gently 
against that of Lulu&#146;s and carefully leaned against the older woman, 
just was quickly as the kiss came as did it quite, the blonde Al-Bhed 
pulled back unsure of what she was doing. 
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry. But&#133;I wanted you to be the first person I kissed. 
Please don&#146;t hate me for that.&#148; Rikku whispered as she moved away from 
the tall mage, Lulu felt warm all over and slightly hollow from the 
action of the young blonde that was so pure about everything she did. 
Lulu touched her lips that were still a dark shade of purple from the 
lipstick she normally wore and she could feel the corners of her mouth 
pull into a full smile, the kind of smile that hadn&#146;t graced her face 
in many years. 
	&#147;Rikku,&#148; She reached out and took the young woman into her thin 
pale arms but she didn&#146;t hug her she just held her at barely arms 
length. &#147;I am glad you wanted me to be your first, but I want to be 
your last as well. I know it is greedy of me, but I can&#146;t help the way 
I feel. You make me happy and you make my nightmares go away when ever 
I hold you in my arms, you make me feel like a person again Rikku.&#148; 
	The young Al-Bhed sat there in silence for a brief second before 
she closed her eyes and made her voice as level as it could at the 
moment.
	&#147;Lulu you never told me what your nightmares are about&#133;.&#148; Rikku 
muttered and looked into the older woman&#146;s face to try and read her 
emotions, Lulu&#146;s brow quivered slightly before she spoke, her heart 
was breaking as each second ticked and Rikku didn&#146;t make a move to 
hold her or tell her she felt the same way.
	&#147;Being alone, that is my nightmare. Being totally alone with no 
one but myself to converse with. I know all of you see me and assume 
that I enjoy the solace that is my dark world of silence and hardened 
emotions, but it is something I completely loath.&#148; Concluded Lulu as 
she looked up at the ceiling to keep her tears from falling down her 
cheeks.
	&#147;Lulu,&#148; Rikku whispered as she cupped the older woman&#146;s face 
with her small palms and eased it down to meet her eyes. &#147;I will 
always be here for you, so you won&#146;t ever be alone again. I know it 
must be hard for you because you always have to be the mature one, the 
one that is both the disciplinarian and the voice of complete reason. 
I don&#146;t want you to feel like that anymore Lulu, I want you to be 
happy and smile.&#148; Rikku leaned in and whispered into the sorceress&#146;s 
ear with hot breath lightly brushing against the fair skin. &#147;Because 
you never know when someone will fall in love with that smile.&#148; Rikku 
declared softly as she placed soft kisses under Lulu&#146;s ear, and across 
her neck until she lightly brushed her lips over the older woman&#146;s 
chin and finally pressed against the mage&#146;s mouth with a sealing kiss 
of her promise. A light blush rose up in both guardians faces as they 
deepened the embrace making silent vows of never ending love, suddenly 
a gasp spun both Lulu and Rikku out of their blissful moment of 
complete union.
	&#147;Oh my.&#148; Yuna rasped out in a shocked tone as she slowly backed 
away from the scene that played before her differently coloured eyes, 
blurting out a rushed apology the young summoner shut the door behind 
her and took off running down the hallway with her cheeks set a flame.
	&#147;Honestly doesn&#146;t anyone knock anymore?&#148; Rikku inquired with a 
reddened face as she slowly turned and gazed at Lulu who was cool and 
calm as normal, the black haired mage shook her head and suddenly let 
out a pent up laugh that threw the younger of the two into a fit of 
giggles. 
	&#147;It appears we should perhaps lock the door from now on,&#148; Lulu 
stated mirthfully with an amused smirk adorning her pale face, Rikku 
nodded with a smile of her own and suddenly bolted out of the bed and 
over to the door and gave the lock a quick flick of the wrist, diving 
back into the bed she crawled over to Lulu and nuzzled the crook of 
the older woman&#146;s neck. &#147;Rikku!&#148; Lulu yelled with a playful air of 
shock to her voice, the blonde Al-Bhed smiled and blushed timidly.
	&#147;What you told me to do it,&#148; Rikku giggled innocently while 
wrapping her arms around the taller woman. &#147;And I am not one to 
disobey my elders.&#148; She teased with a large grin; Lulu narrowed her 
eyes a little before she suddenly spoke in a deep sultry voice. 
	&#147;I will make you pay for that.&#148; Lulu cooed devilishly and gently 
pushed Rikku onto her back and tenderly yet very assertively straddled 
her hips. The young blonde blushed a shade of dark red and gasped in 
half surprise, Lulu&#146;s grin widened as she let her fingertips roam 
freely over the younger girl&#146;s body causing moans and purrs to escape 
from the blonde Al-Bhed beneath her. 
	&#147;You-you can this pay b-b-back?&#148; Rikku murmured softly while 
relishing every moment Lulu made, smiling impishly the black haired 
mage leaned close so she was all but laying on top of the young 
Al-Bhed and whispered in a hushed voice that made Rikku&#146;s stomach get 
butterflies.
	&#147;No, but this is!&#148; Blurted Lulu as she began to tickle the 
unsuspecting thief, Rikku squealed and began to thrash around on the 
bed trying in vane to rid herself of her loving attacker, Lulu laughed 
as a few braided locks of ebony hair cascaded down her face which 
tickled her own nose. Rikku collapsed from exhaustion after only a few 
minutes of frenzied struggling and torture the young blonde panted out 
in a ragged voice. 
	&#147;How did you know I was so ticklish?&#148; 
	Lulu gave Rikku a thoughtful look before she brought back her 
serious demeanor and stated in a matter of factly voice.
	&#147;You look ticklish.&#148; She smiled while she continued to straddle 
the younger girl&#146;s hips, Rikku blushed lightly and suddenly wrapped 
her arms around Lulu&#146;s neck and brought her on top of her own body.
	&#147;And you look gorgeous but that doesn&#146;t give me any advantages 
over you now does it?&#148; Rikku mused playfully as she flicked her tongue 
out and licked Lulu&#146;s lips; the dark haired mage blushed deeply at the 
suddenness of the sexual action her sweet and innocent Rikku just 
showed her. 
	&#147;Don&#146;t tease it isn&#146;t polite.&#148; Lulu scolded mockingly, while 
running her hand through the thin Al-Bhed&#146;s tangled tresses, Rikku 
smirked and leaned in and licked the older woman&#146;s lips again.
	&#147;Maybe I&#146;m not teasing, maybe I want to make love to you right 
here right now.&#148; Stated the blonde girl seriously; Lulu&#146;s red eyes 
widened in complete shock. &#147;Or maybe I am.&#148; Rikku giggled and smiled 
up at Lulu with innocent eyes. 
	&#147;Oh now that&#146;s just plain cruel.&#148; Lulu chimed and brought her 
face down and stopped barely a millimeter away from Rikku&#146;s face and 
licked the younger girl&#146;s lips, Rikku pouted for a second but suddenly 
grinned as she shot her own tongue out to meet that of Lulu&#146;s, 
pleasantly surprised the black mage moved in the final millimeter and 
passionately pressed her mouth over Rikku&#146;s and continued their 
playful duel of sorts. 
	Almost a full minute had passed before the two broke apart of 
air, both were panting and beginning to sweat lightly, very slowly 
Rikku muttered something that made Lulu want to laugh and cry at the 
same time.
	&#147;So how do we make love?&#148; She asked innocently with a smile, 
Lulu bit her own bottom lip and set out to enlighten her young lover 
on how to indeed be a lover.
