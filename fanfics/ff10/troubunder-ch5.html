<h1>The Trouble with Understanding (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff10/troubunder-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Elma stretched taut muscles, feeling joints snap with the effort. She 
glanced up at the early-morning sky, watching as soft orange replaced 
pale, grayish-blue. She hopped out of her cot and moved to wake Tyhlan. 
&quot;Come on, time for work.&quot;

The other girl shifted uneasily in her sleep, legs and arms twitching as 
she moved to get comfortable again. Soft strands of blonde hair 
fluttered on the pillow as she settled back into peaceful slumber. 
&quot;G&#39;way, Elma...&quot; she managed to utter, before her breathing fell back 
into soft snores. Elma shook her head, sending unruly bangs into 
disarray. She grumbled and pushed them back into place. She needed a 
bandanna of some sort; her hair, even cut, still managed to be as 
disagreeable as it had been long.

Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she slipped on her uniform hurriedly, tying 
her boots with quick, careful precision. She brushed invisible wrinkles 
from her dull gray uniform shirt and moved back to Tyhlan&#39;s cot, trying 
to remember the Al Bhed she had picked up from the primers the other 
girl had given her throughout the weeks. She knelt down close and 
brushed away loose strands of hair from the half Al Bhed&#39;s ear. The best 
way to learn was to practice.

&quot;FYGA IB!&quot; She called sharply. Tyhlan screamed in shock and struggled 
out of her cot, falling on an awkward angle.

&quot;Ahh! What?! What?! What...&quot; The blonde glanced up sharply when she 
heard Elma&#39;s giggles. &quot;What was that for?!&quot;

Elma shrugged helplessly, and, still giggling, extended a hand to help 
Tyhlan to her feet. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t wake up,&quot; she said simply. &quot;We have to 
go. Hurry up and get ready. You said it yourself...&quot; she began, waiting 
for Tyhlan to finish the sentence.

&quot;Right, right,&quot; the blonde muttered, rubbing sleep from her bright blue 
eyes. &quot;Slave driver. I think you blew out my eardrum,&quot; she mumbled 
irritably, sticking her index finger in her right ear momentarily. &quot;It&#39;s 
hard to hear on this side,&quot; she whined, moving down to tie her boots.

&quot;Well learn to wake up on time,&quot; Elma said.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to scream...&quot;

Elma rose her hands in the air in defeat. &quot;Well I tried to wake you up 
the nice way! Gosh, people are never satisfied.&quot;

Tyhlan shrugged and hopped to her feet, stretching before trotting 
ahead. &quot;Well next time you get woken up by someone screaming in Al Bhed 
in your ear, you try to be satisfied. Last one to the main camp is a 
shoopuff!&quot; She called out, running ahead. &quot;And oh, your accent&#39;s getting 
better!&quot; she added as she made her way to the camp, running at a pace 
that would rival a chocobo&#39;s.

&quot;W-wait up!&quot; Elma cried out, stumbling over stray rocks in her hurry to 
catch up. &quot;You always get a head start!&quot;

----------------

Elma trotted into the main camp right after Tyhlan, who had already ran 
over to the other cadets to chat before they started the training for 
the day. Elma leaned over and took deep breaths, trying to force oxygen 
back into her lungs.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how she runs so fast sometimes...&quot; she said in-between 
gasps.

&quot;Hey, you! Cadet Elma!&quot; Elma glanced up sharply at the sound of the 
voice. The young trainer was standing over her, holding a recording 
sphere.

&quot;You got some mail,&quot; he said, handing the device to her. She grasped it 
tightly, and stared into it, biting her lip as she thought.

&quot;Can I...look at it now?&quot;

The young man shrugged. &quot;Just hurry up. We&#39;ve got a little bit of time 
left before we start.&quot; She glanced up and noticed he was holding a 
sphere as well. She figured it was from his brother, which was why he 
was giving them the extra time. He probably wanted to watch his sphere 
in peace as well.

&quot;Alright. Thank you sir!&quot;

The boy shrugged again. &quot;No problem, cadet. Just hurry up.&quot;

Elma nodded and trotted off away from the main crowd, slipping behind a 
large tent in the area. She flicked on the sphere and leaned back to 
watch. Captain Lucil&#39;s face appeared on the screen, and besides looking 
a little tired, she appeared no worse for wear. Elma sighed in relief.

&quot;Hello cadet. I&#39;m pleased to hear you and the others are doing well.&quot; 
The older woman sighed, shifted her weight from one foot to the other. 
Elma could hear soft voices in the background, caught the flash of a 
bonfire. &quot;The battle is going...better than I expected. Remember what I 
said about Sinspawn in one lesson?&quot; She seemed to wait for Elma&#39;s nod 
before continuing. &quot;Well, as I said, they must be killed quickly, or Sin 
will come back to gather them up...and we certainly don&#39;t want that. 
We&#39;ve been trying to exterminate them as quickly as possible.&quot; Elma 
frowned, and then giggled softly to herself when she saw the captain 
hold in a yawn. &quot;Well, it seems as if it is time for me to retire for 
the night. Continue your training in earnest while I am gone; you have 
the makings to become a fine warrior. I do...appreciate the fact that 
you sent me a sphere. It served as a great comfort. Feel free to...send 
me any of your reports on your training from now on, if the mood hits 
you. May Yevon be with you.&quot;

The sphere flicked off, and Elma grinned goofily, going back to the main 
group. When she approached Tyhlan, the other girl gave her a confused 
look.

&quot;You&#39;ve got this really funny look on your face, Elma.&quot; Tyhlan&#39;s 
eyebrows furrowed in concern. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;She wants me to keep sending her spheres until she comes back,&quot; Elma 
whispered in a rush. &quot;Isn&#39;t that great?&quot;

Tyhlan looked a little uneasy, but covered it up quickly with a bright 
smile. &quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yep!&quot;

&quot;What else did she say?&quot;

&quot;Well, not much else. She talked about fighting the Sinspawn, and...oh, 
well! What does it matter?&quot; Elma hopped around Tyhlan excitedly. &quot;She 
wants to keep talking to me!&quot;

Tyhlan laughed, but her expression grew solemn soon afterward. &quot;Elma, 
you might not want to get your hopes up too much. She&#39;s probably 
concerned about you from a professional standpoint, is all.&quot;

&quot;Well, I know, but...&quot; she smiled dreamily. &quot;It&#39;s still really nice...&quot;

Tyhlan shook her head. &quot;Well, okay. But...if you&#39;re really serious about 
this...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;...Then, good luck.&quot;

&quot;Well, thanks.&quot; Elma scratched her head. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Tyhlan looked startled for a moment, and then nodded. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m 
fine. We better get to work...&quot;

--------------

Tyhlan sung a song as she darted back and forth, enthusiastically 
throwing stones in Elma&#39;s direction.

&quot;I&#39;m a soldier, whylred oy! E udjadlreg e cit&#39;oy! Oy cduioi hy tijr 
guhdcyr ukhoy! Ukepyoy jenywre, upkuhoyoy csand&#39; e wrewh&#39;! Oy paki 
cnywed&#39;coy c dah&#39;oi mwre...Cgum&#39;gu p hedaz ha bmoum upsyh, bugywrad meg 
cjady ecdehy! Save your tears, for the day, when our pain is far behind! 
On your feet, come with me! We are soldiers, stand or die!&quot;

&quot;That sounds nice!&quot; Elma called out, moving to dodge another stone. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know you could sing!&quot;

&quot;Eh, I er...pfft! I&#39;m okay!&quot; Tyhlan looked a little embarrassed, and 
Elma frowned. It wasn&#39;t like her to be humble about anything.

&quot;&#39;Okay&#39;? What happened to being awesome?&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m that great at it,&quot; Tyhlan grumbled. &quot;I&#39;m tired. 
Let&#39;s stop for today.&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;ve been acting really odd,&quot; Elma murmured. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re 
alright?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing you need to worry about. Really. Don&#39;t ask.&quot;

&quot;I thought...remember what you said about secrets?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...none of your concern, Elma. It&#39;ll just cause problems. You 
should...probably go make another sphere for the captain. I&#39;m sure 
she&#39;ll appreciate it.&quot;

&quot;Fine then!&quot; Elma scoffed. &quot;If you&#39;re going to be a jerk about it, then 
I&#39;ll leave you alone!&quot; She stalked off, leaving the other girl behind.

---------------

&quot;Hello, Captain,&quot; Elma murmured into the new sphere she had gotten from 
the main camp. Tyhlan still hadn&#39;t returned from the training area, but 
Elma didn&#39;t really care. She was still angry with her. She had taken her 
advice however, and sat down on a large rock a little ways away from the 
main camp as she recorded her message to Lucil.

&quot;Today was...pretty uneventful. The stone throwing practice is getting a 
lot easier; do you have anymore suggestions? I also...&quot;

&quot;Elma?&quot;

Elma glanced up from the sphere and frowned. &quot;What?&quot;

Tyhlan took a seat next to her and scratched her head. &quot;I just wanted to 
see if you were okay...I figured you&#39;d be here.&quot;

Elma glanced down at the sphere in her hands. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you telling me 
anything?&quot;

&quot;Do you know why I want to be in the Chocobo Knights, Elma?&quot;

&quot;I...I never...you never told me.&quot;

&quot;My mom told me to join.&quot;

&quot;How come?&quot;

&quot;...Because a Sinspawn tore off my father&#39;s head. There weren&#39;t any 
summoners around, no one. He was out at sea. He died...he died alone.&quot;

&quot;Oh...Tyhlan, I&#39;m so...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not finished. Mom told me that tears wouldn&#39;t help. &#39;Nor songs, 
Tyhlan,&#39; she said. &#39;There won&#39;t be any songs for happiness, no dancing 
for laughter. You&#39;ll learn the way of fighters now.&#39; We traveled a lot, 
after he died. One look in my eyes, and people would send us away. 
She...she was just so tired. And you know, for a while...for a while I 
thought it was me, that it was my fault. But no. It&#39;s Sin, and Yevon, 
Yevon too!&quot;

&quot;Tyhlan! That&#39;s blasphemy! You can&#39;t say that!&quot;

&quot;If Yevon hadn&#39;t been around, then maybe my mom could have found some 
place for us to stay! Then she wouldn&#39;t have died! That&#39;s why I joined! 
Maybe if we stop Sin, we&#39;ll stop Yevon too!&quot; She bit her lip and lowered 
her head. Sphere forgotten, Elma knelt down and pulled the other girl 
into a hug.

&quot;It&#39;s not Yevon&#39;s fault, Tyhlan...it&#39;s not. Those people that turned 
your mother and you away, it&#39;s them. They&#39;re at fault....they should 
have learned to understand. I did, see? I&#39;m sorry, I really am sorry...&quot;

&quot;I...I know.&quot; Tyhlan sniffled. &quot;I got your shirt all wet...&quot;

Elma laughed. &quot;It&#39;s fine! I&#39;m sorry I was being such a baby earlier...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry too. Uh, you mind not...telling anyone about the crying 
thing? I have a reputation to uphold, you know.&quot;

Elma grinned. &quot;Sure.&quot;

Tyhlan bit her lip again, suddenly looking nervous. &quot;Elma?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; she faltered, shook her head. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

----------------

A/N: Woo. I did enjoy writing that chapter, though nothing much in the 
way of training happened. The Al Bhed for this chapter takes a bit of 
explanation, so I&#39;ll get to explaining! The song Tyhlan sings is from 
the Ghost In the Shell soundtrack, called rise, by Origa, composed by 
Yoko Kanno.

Now, here&#39;s the thing. A lot of it goes from Russian to English and back 
pretty abruptly, so here&#39;s the translation:

Al Bhed notes: &quot;FYGA IB!&quot;-WAKE UP!

&quot;Whylred oy! E udjadlreg e cit&#39;oy! Oy cduioi hy tijr guhdcyr ukhoy! 
Ukepyoy jenywre, upkuhoyoy csand&#39; e wrewh&#39;! Oy paki cnywed&#39;coy c dah&#39;oi 
mwre...Cgum&#39;gu p hedaz ha bmoum upsyh, bugywrad meg cjady ecdehy!&quot; 
translates to,

&quot;Znachit ya! I otvetchik i sud&#39;ya! Ya stoyu na dvuh kontsah ognya! 
Ogibaya virazhi, obgonyaya smert&#39; i zhizn&#39;! Ya begu srazit&#39;sya s ten&#39;yu 
lzhi...Skol&#39;ko b nitej ne plyol obman, Pokazhet lik sveta istina!&quot; which 
translates to,

&quot;(I&#39;m a soldier,)and that means! I&#39;m both defendant and judge! I am 
standing on the two ends of fire! Bending over the steep turns, 
overtaking death and life, I&#39;m running to fight the shadow of the 
lies...No matter how much threads deceit weaves, the truth will show the 
face of light!&quot; (Given the eventual ending of X, it&#39;s fitting, huh?) </pre>
