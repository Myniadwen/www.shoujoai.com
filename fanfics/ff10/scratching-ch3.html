&quot;Hey, hurry up! We don&#39;t have all day to wait for you two old grease 
monkeys!&quot; ~ Rikku

second when did you learn to speak Al-Bhed?!&quot; ~Rikku

&quot;Little sister, it is good to see you again.&quot; ~ Brother

&quot;Brother.&quot; ~ Rikku

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;I don&#146;t see why you just don&#146;t go ahead and tell Cid that you two 
are&#133;umm&#133;seeing each other. What could it hurt, ya?&#148; Murmured Wakka as 
he lend against the side of an archway, with an irate grunt the dark 
haired sorceress turned her line of vision on the short muscular blitz 
ball player. 

&quot;Listen Wakka, Rikku and I are not telling Cid for obvious reasons. 
One, he could very well not want me seeing Rikku anymore. Two, he 
might disown her if he finds out. So please, let us tell him on our 
own accord.&quot; Worriedly stated Lulu with a somber tone to her low 
almost husky voice, slowly nodding the spiky-haired Beside guardian 
looked from the fair skinned black mage to Rikku who was sitting on 
the ground with her legs crossed and an expression of foreboding doom 
etched on her pretty face. With an almost shy air around her the young 
thief stood up and carefully padded over to where her ebony haired 
lover was standing, with shaking hands Rikku wrapped her arms around 
Lulu&#39;s slender waist bringing the older woman into a tender embrace. 

&quot;C&#39;mon Lulu cheer up,&quot; Rikku whispered into the mage&#39;s ear as she 
nuzzled her cheek against Lulu&#39;s bare shoulder. &quot;We have to stay 
positive about this and be ob-sta-miss-tic&#133;err&#133;optimistic, yeah that&#39;s 
the word. We have to keep our heads high and not fear what might 
happen, after all this is my dad we are talking about, I really doubt 
he would just up and abandon me because I am in love with you.&quot; 
Giggled Rikku as she leaned back and smiled weakly at the black mage 
with a deep fondness that only a lover could, forcing a grin of her 
own Lulu nodded and gave the blonde girl a quick peak on the cheek 
causing Rikku to blush lightly at the sudden act of affection. 

&quot;Yeah, listen to the kid. She knows what&#39;s what, ya? Anyhow here comes 
the welcome wagon now, so you two better perk up otherwise Cid will 
know something is up, chu know?&quot; Chided Wakka as he made a show of 
overdramatically waving his arms over his head as the Highwind came 
into view. Sighing slightly Lulu brushed a tress of long braided ebony 
hair from her shoulder as she tightened her hold on her Onion Knight, 
the softness of the stuffed creature almost ripping under her fierce 
grip as the large Al-Bhed airship set down a kilometer away causing a 
rush of wind to flow over the mage mussing her long hair. 

&quot;Umm, Lulu.&quot; Rikku&#39;s voice suddenly spoke out as Lulu watched the 
hatch of the Highwind opened up revealing two male figures that were 
still concealed in a vague darkness from the ship&#39;s hull. Coyly 
shifting her red eyes to the side the mistress of the black arts saw 
the blonde Al-Bhed smile sweetly and hold up her gloved hand giving 
her a thumbs up and a small wink, both actions forced Lulu to grin 
widely and shake her head with a playful motion that just seemed to 
scream &#39;why me?&#39; giggling the young guardian threw her fist into the 
air joyfully waving at the two people that had just stepped off the 
ship. &quot;Everything will be okay,&quot; Stated the blonde Al-Bhed just above 
a whisper before she turned her head and shouted at the one man that 
was slowly approaching leaving the other figure standing by the ship&#39;s 
opening. &quot;Rao, rinno ib! Fa tuh&#39;d ryja ymm tyo du fyed vun oui dfu umt 
knayca suhgaoc!&quot; Yelled Rikku in a teasing tone as she bolted towards 
her father in order to meet him halfway, with a deep mock frown Cid 
looked at the young blonde girl with a stern gaze that held a secret 
gentleness to it as she met him after a few moments of running. 

&quot;Cu e ryja paah nyecehk y muitsuidr ymm draca oaync? Teth&#39;d e naylr 
oui nacbald vun ouin amtanc kenmo? Ur clnaf ed! Keja ouin umt syh y 
rik!&quot; Laughed the bald Al-Bhed as he wrapped his arms around Rikku&#39;s 
thin waist giving her a tight embrace as he lifted her off of the 
ground causing the blonde thief to gasp for much needed oxygen. 

&quot;Vydran! Ylg, yc silr yc e seccat oui duu, e secc yen y fruma mud 
suna, bmayca mad sa ku tyt.&quot; Playfully wheezed Rikku as she returned 
the tight hug and giggled lightly, setting the blonde teen down with 
ease Cid looked from his daughter to the rest of the guardians that 
were still standing by the inn waiting patiently. 

&quot;Paah cdyoehk uid uv dnuipma e ruba?&quot; Inquired the pilot of the 
Highwind as if he were trying to make small talk, the tone of Cid&#39;s 
voice was almost flat and seemed to carry a certain note of depression 
to it, shaking her head the blonde guardian looked to the older man 
with a soft smile that was both apologetic and warm. 

&quot;Huba,&quot; Rikku chimed in her normal perky tone that was laced with an 
added bit of cheerfulness to it, smiling wholeheartedly Cid shook his 
head at the blonde girl&#39;s antics. &quot;C&#39;mon dad you should know me by 
now, a feisty young Al-Bhed, I get into so much trouble just being 
what I am, I don&#39;t need to try.&quot; Declared the young thief in a soft 
tone that was almost hurt sounding for a brief moment, shaking his 
head again Cid placed a large hand on Rikku&#39;s shoulder, it was a 
gesture both knew meant more that what it seemed, Cid being too much 
of a man to truly show his soft side off very often; even to his own 
children. With pursed lips Rikku bounced in front of her father 
standing on her tiptoes wiggling her index finger in front of her like 
a scolding teacher, blinking for a split second the older Al-Bhed just 
stared at the thin blonde girl, slowly a loud rumble escaped Cid&#39;s 
mouth as he chuckled at the amusing teen in front of him.      

&quot;Gods Rikku, you never cease to make me smile,&quot; Suddenly Cid took a 
deep tone that startled the young Al-Bhed as he looked at her with 
hardened eyes. &quot;We need to talk about a few things when everyone is on 
board the ship, I am just giving you fair warning, not all of it is 
good news I am gonna be discussing with you.&quot; And with that the bald 
pilot of the Highwind left Rikku standing frozen to the very spot she 
stood on with a look of dread slowly spreading on her now pale face.  

Does he know about me and Lulu&#133;how could he&#133;oh my gods&#133;what is Yunnie 
told him&#133;me and Lulu never told her not to tell&#133;shit! Rikku mentally 
screamed as she all but snapped her neck towards the direction of the 
inn, with a low whine raising up her throat the young Al-Bhed jogged 
after her father although he was already standing with the others and 
chit-chatting with Yuna and Lulu. Even to her own dismay it took Rikku 
a bit longer to reach where everyone was due to the fact she fell on 
her face when she locked eyes with the black mage and received a 
seductive wink barely over Cid&#39;s shoulder, this threw the blonde girl 
mind into a spin causing her knees to quiver and give out, luckily 
Lulu was the only one who saw the young guardian take a literal 
nosedive at her playful action, with a slightly startled expression on 
her pale face the ebony haired woman muffled a gasp with a cupped hand 
and suddenly darted her head back towards the direction of 
conversation. 

&quot;So,&quot; Yuna drawled out as she looked at Cid with a soft smile that lit 
up her differently coloured eyes. &quot;I hear that you are going to 
rebuild the Al-Bhed Home at Lake Macalania&#133;is that true?&quot; Inquired the 
summoner in a diplomatic tone that was instilled in her so many years 
ago, Cid smirked as he crossed his arms over his large chest and 
nodded silently to the question that was asked. Yuna frowned lightly 
at his response but thought it more polite not to question what he 
thought best for his people. 

&quot;Dad,&quot; Rikku blurted from seemingly nowhere as she snuck up behind her 
father causing the older man to jump, seeing as how she caught him off 
guard the thin thief giggled with pride at her accomplishment. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you think that is a bit&#133;dramatic?&quot; Stated Rikku in a serious voice 
that caused Cid to quirk an eyebrow at the girl. 

&quot;Drastic, you mean.&quot; Corrected Lulu in a calm tone that was very 
unlike what Rikku was used to, especially since she knew the softer 
side of the older woman, sticking her tongue out the young Al-Bhed 
blew a raspberry at the black haired woman.

&quot;That too,&quot; Giggled Rikku not missing a beat, with a wide smile she 
turned back to the Highwind pilot. &quot;So, why are you rebuilding in that 
horrible place anyhow&#133;it is really too cold there ya know.&quot; Stated 
Rikku with a nod as she crossed her arms over her still developing 
chest in a mimicking pose of the man she was standing beside, rubbing 
his chin Cid shrugged deeply and shook his head.

&quot;Would you rather we rebuild in the Thunder Plains?&quot; Retorted Cid with 
a gruff laugh that just seemed to rattled Lulu&#39;s cool exterior, 
stiffening slightly at the word &#39;thunder&#39; the blonde Al-Bhed shivered 
slightly and slowly edged closer to the mistress of the dark arts 
suddenly wanting to be held. 

&quot;N-n-n-n-n-n-n-no&#133;why would I want that?!&quot; Shouted Rikku in a deadpan 
voice that made the bald man almost wince. 

&quot;Then you should just be happy we aren&#39;t rebuilding there.&quot; Mirthfully 
mused Cid as he patted his daughter&#39;s shoulder, as he lifted his large 
hand from her petite frame he noticed how she gave a small shiver and 
seemed to pale a bit more by the second, he also took note how the 
black mage named Lulu seemed to almost glare at him for his little 
joke. Damn she is a protective one isn&#39;t she&#133;that witch must see 
herself as Rikku&#39;s surrogate mother or something, it is good to know 
my little girl has good people to take care of her while she is away 
from me. Cid inwardly chuckled to himself suddenly feeling a weight 
lift off his shoulders, the thought of Rikku being protected by a 
frail looking mage seemed to put his worried mind at ease for a brief 
while, but it also caused him to shuttered under the realization his 
little girl was growing up and most likely was the one doing the 
majority of the protecting between the two of the female guardians. 

&quot;Well, shall we be going then? It is getting rather on into the day 
and we need to get settled in to our new a commendations, don&#39;t you 
think Uncle Cid.&quot; Yuna inquired in a low tone as she gazed at the 
elder Al-Bhed man, with a short shrug of his broad shoulders the pilot 
of the Highwind pointed towards the airship with a grin.

&quot;Already and waiting for ya Yuna.&quot; Stated Cid as he turned and looked 
at the large machina ship, his dull eyes lighting up at the very sight 
of his pride and joy. Giggling Rikku looked at the aircraft then to 
her father while shaking her head as if disapprovingly only to receive 
a stern warning look from both the bald Al-Bhed and the young 
summoner, blinking back a half startled look the young blonde 
embarrassedly gawked down at her feet as she suddenly felt the urge to 
kick at the grass sheepishly. 

&quot;Lets get going then, shall we?&quot; Rhetorically declared Yuna as she 
headed towards the Highwind at a leisurely pace closely followed by 
Cid and the others; all except Rikku and Lulu who hung back and walked 
side-by-side passing longing glances to each other. 

&quot;Cu vyn cu kuut.&quot; Whispered the blonde thief to herself as she 
stealthily reached her small hand out and stroked the ebony haired 
sorceress&#39;s arm through her black satiny sleeve, with her red orbs 
narrowed into small slits Lulu removed her long slender fingers from 
her Onion Knight and gently placed her hand onto the young girl&#39;s back 
rubbing comforting circles with her palm. 

&quot;Ajanodrehk femm pa veha, e tuh&#39;d fyhd oui du funno. Ed ibcadc sa du 
hu aht caaehk oui mega drec; e bnuseca ajanodrehk femm pa veha.&quot; 
Breathed Lulu as she delicately pronounced every syllable with added 
care and articulation, bashfully the younger of the two guardians 
nodded slightly causing blonde braids to fall into her eyes giving her 
a look of a shy child for a moment. 

&quot;Lulu, e fuimt gemm zicd du ryja oui rumt sa nekrd huf...rao fyed y 
caluht frah tet oui maynh du cbayg Al-Bhed?!&quot; Rikku choked out in a 
loud gasp of pure astonishment as she gazed into the black mage&#39;s 
crimson eyes, Rikku knew that Lulu could translate her language but 
she had no clue that she could speak it as well, stifling a soft laugh 
with a balled hand Lulu smiled at the younger girl with a bemused 
smirk playing across her porcelain coloured face.

&quot;I borrowed Titus&#39;s Al-Bhed primers for a bit, I wanted to surprise 
you with being able to understand your native tongue. Pleasantly I see 
it worked as I intended, though I wanted to spring my newly aquired 
skill in a more&#133; intimate way. But I suppose now that we will be 
around more Al-Bheds, my ability to understand your people will be 
more practical.&quot; Mirthfully stated Lulu as she watched the shock on 
her lover&#39;s face replace with a mischievous grin that she knew all too 
well. &quot;Uh-uh-uh,&quot; Murmured the older woman as she wiggled her long 
index finger at the blonde girl with a wolfish grin of her own. &quot;There 
will be on of that on this trip young lady, so just get those thoughts 
out of your pretty little head right this moment.&quot; Chortled Lulu in a 
playful tone as her expression betrayed her stoic and self-possessed 
nature that she shelled herself  with to almost everyone but a very 
rare few. Wrinkling her nose Rikku made a face that was somewhere 
between disappointed and vexed, slowly the young Al-Bhed stuck her 
tongue out at the ebony haired witch teasingly.

&quot;You&#39;re no fun at all anymore Lulu, always raining on my party, I 
swear woman what am I gonna do with you. And if you say anything about 
chocolate pudding you&#39;ll be contradicting yourself, so there!&quot; 
Retorted Rikku as she winked and started to dash out in front of Lulu 
running backwards so she could still look at the older woman, flicking 
a long dark braid behind her shoulder the mage closed her eyes and 
seemed to walk with an add bit of swagger to her hips. 

&quot;Rain on your parade you mean,&quot; Wittily corrected Lulu in a low 
seductive tone that made the blonde thief&#39;s cheeks redden. &quot;And I 
would never dream of saying such things about desserts and 
your&#133;equally delicious body. Though it was very enjoyable last time we 
did that.&quot; Mused the dark haired woman with desire raising up her 
whole being at the memory of the petite blonde covered from head to 
toe with rich milk chocolate, unfortunately for the black mage Rikku 
was still dressed under all of the sticky sweetness, how was the 
younger girl to know she was suppose to be naked when she did things 
like that. 

&quot;I think my goggles still have some of that pudding on them,&quot; Giggled 
Rikku as she lifted her red goggles to her eyes and inspected them 
closely. &quot;Yeah, see there still is. Just around the edges though. Next 
time we use banana pudding, and you are the one putting it on, 
err&#133;though I think you will need to take off your dress, I don&#39;t think 
that stuff will come out of fur so easily.&quot; Nodded Rikku sagely as she 
looked Lulu over then smiled impishly, folding her arms over her bust 
the sorceress raised an eyebrow while trying to calm her flushing 
cheeks.

&quot;And you say I am the one with the overactive sex drive,&quot; Lulu sighed 
and shook her head with exuberance. &quot;What am I going to do with you?&quot; 
Muttered the older woman with a slight smile as she looked at Rikku 
then realized that was the wrong thing to say.

&quot;Oh, oh, oh&#133;I know, I know!&quot; Beamed Rikku in a giddy tone that told 
Lulu exactly what the blonde Al-Bhed was going to say.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about voicing that remark young lady.&quot; Declared Lulu 
in a mock stern voice; that made the young blonde fold her arms over 
her chest and pout childishly. 

&quot;Wet blanket.&quot; Grumbled Rikku as she turned around and lightly slapped 
her own backside as a taunt, Lulu&#39;s eyes widened at the use of Provoke 
outside of battle, blinking for a moment the dark haired witch 
narrowed her red orbs at the young girl then pointed towards the 
Highwind causing Rikku to spin around looking for the reason Lulu had 
motioned towards the machina airship. The sudden sting on her left 
cheek caused the young blonde to let out a high-pitched yelp as she 
felt Lulu&#39;s hand smack against her backside, it didn&#39;t really hurt all 
that much just rather startled her that her lover had just slapped her 
ass in clear view of everyone. 

&quot;Serves you right for taunting me, you know how I can&#39;t resist 
touching your cute little&#133;.&quot; Purred Lulu in a husky tone but was 
suddenly cut off by a man shouting at the two.

&quot;WOULD YOU TWO HURRY UP!? I&#39;VE SEEN DEAD THINGS MOVE FASTER THAN THE 
TWO OF YOU!&quot; Screamed Cid as he franticly waved his hands over his 
head in hopes to attract the two female guardians attention, blushing 
fiercely Rikku looked at Lulu who suddenly had her cool and collected 
face on again, sighing lightly the Al-Bhed girl took off towards the 
Highwind at full charge leaving the pale mage in her tracks. After a 
brief moment the young blonde panted as she plopped on the springy 
grass underfoot earning several looks from everyone around her 
including Lulu who was standing against an archway with an unreadable 
expression on her face. 

&quot;That&#133;isn&#39;t fair&#133;&quot; Gasped Rikku as she sucked down air like no 
tomorrow. &quot;She used Haste, and don&#39;t you dare call me out of shape 
dad.&quot; Groaned the blonde Al-Bhed as she stood up on shaky legs and all 
but grunted at the act, with a short chuckle Cid cleared his throat 
and looked at his daughter. 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t gonna call you out of shape, now get in the ship before I 
leave you here.&quot; Declared the bald man with a half smirk on his aged 
face, with a coy grin Rikku nodded in a &#39;yeah right&#39; fashion as she 
walked into the hull of the Highwind closely followed by the others. 

&quot;Meddma cecdan, ed ec kuut du caa oui ykyeh.&quot; A male voice suddenly 
sprang from the shadows causing the blonde girl to shriek back like a 
snake had just struck at her, staggering a few meters to the left the 
blonde guardian instantly pulled her lithe frame into a fighting 
stance, with the slow realization that the speaker was none other than 
her older brother Rikku hesitantly dropped her fist and narrowed her 
cool blue eyes.

&quot;Pnudran.&quot; Lamely stated the youthful blonde as she brushed a sandy 
tress of braided hair behind her small ear and tried to resist the 
urge to break into a run and get as far away from the Mohawk wearing 
Al-Bhed as she could but failed miserably. &quot;Sorry can&#39;t stay, gotta 
get settled in ya know, well later, bye-bye.&quot; Rambled Rikku as she 
suddenly bolted down a corridor and took off towards the bridge of the 
ship, leaving a slightly nervous looking Brother scratching the back 
of his shaved head. 

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Grumbled Cid in a now low almost bitter 
sounding tone, shrugging his shoulders the younger of the two Al-Bhed 
men turned around and started to follow in the direction his little 
sister had so quickly rushed off towards. 

&quot;Whoa, Lu watch it! You are starting to get that weird magic vibe 
going ya!&quot; Wakka exclaimed as he rubbed a spot on his shoulder that 
had suddenly turned red from an extreme drop in temperature, snapping 
her attention to the tan Beside guardian the ebony haired mage gawked 
at him with confusion knitting her brow into a tight wrinkle. With 
raised eyebrows Lulu suddenly saw that her bottled rage was slowly 
escaping her control causing small sparks of magic to fly from her 
plush toy without her notice, lowering her head apologetically the 
dark manned sorceress loosened her grip on her spell casting aid as 
she forced all of her emotions to the back of her mind, even though 
she realized this action would only amplify her anger a million fold 
in the long run. Taking a deep breath Lulu looked up with a certain 
darkness to her red eyes, a darkness Wakka had only seen once before 
and hoped never to see again.

&quot;My sincerely apologies Wakka, I don&#39;t know what has gotten into me. 
If you will, I believe I need to be excused for a moment if I may?&quot; 
Uttered Lulu in a shallow tone as she addressed Yuna without name; 
nodding her head lightly the young summoner motioned for the older 
woman to do whatever she felt necessary, bowing in return the fair 
skinned witch quickly walked off in the direction of the bridge in 
hopes to catch up to her young lover. 

As Lulu felt her teeth unclench and her breathing slowly returned to 
its regular pattern, she could feel the boiling rage subsiding 
momentarily as her feet silently padded along the metal corridors of 
the Highwind, in the back of her mind the black mage knew her anger 
would end up getting the best of her as it always had in the end. 
Shaking her head as she tried to dislodge the thoughts from her 
suddenly burning mind Lulu swiped away a soft lock of braided hair, 
her head pounding at the temples causing her to let out a pent up sigh 
that was ragged and a bit drawl out. 

&quot;Lulu,&quot; A hushed voice whispered from behind the tall woman as a pair 
of thin arms encircled around the mage&#39;s slender waist eliciting a 
short gasp from the woman. &quot;I don&#146;t want to be here, lets run away.&quot; 
Cooed Rikku in a half serious voice as she all but pulled the pale 
guardian into a barely lit room, with a low thud the automatic door 
slid closed behind the two as they entered. With a relieved smirk Lulu 
turned her head at an odd angle as she stroked the sides of Rikku&#39;s 
face with the back of her ivory coloured hand, the sight that greeted 
her wine red hues caused her light smile to faultier and replace with 
a deep frown that seemed suddenly pained. 

&quot;You aren&#146;t serious are you, Rikku, sweetie you know we can&#39;t just go 
and leave. It is our mission as guardians to protect Lady Yuna to the 
end.&quot; Declared Lulu as she turned around fully and gazed into the 
blonde thief&#39;s childlike face wishing they could just run away and 
never come back, shyly biting her lower lip the younger of the two 
guardians slowly cleared her throat as she brought her body against 
that of the older woman&#39;s.

&quot;What&#133;what if that is all it is&#133;just an end&#133;what if we can&#39;t beat Sin? 
Lulu, I don&#39;t want Yunnie to die for nothing&#133;I don&#39;t want Yunnie to 
die at all&#133;we are so close to the end&#133;and no one has thought of a way 
to keep from sacrificing Yuna&#133;we are all just sitting back and staling 
for borrowed time, Lulu what if we can&#39;t save Yunnie, what if we can&#39;t 
beat Sin, I&#39;m scared&#133;and this waiting isn&#39;t helping that any. You know 
what they say, it is always calmest before the storm, and right now 
everything is calm, too calm for its own good, Lulu&#133;the storm is 
coming I can feel it&#133;and I don&#39;t know if&#133;if&#133;we are ready for it.&quot; 
Stuttered Rikku as she laid her head onto the taller woman&#39;s shoulder 
relishing the warmth of her skin on her cool cheek, tenderly the pale 
sorceress stroked the younger girl&#39;s tangled tresses lovingly 
smoothing soft braids of sandy hair away from Rikku&#39;s blue eyes.

&quot;They also say, it is always darkest before the dawn. Love, I want you 
to promise me something, if I ever ask you for anything this is that 
one thing.&quot; Whispered Lulu in a low hushed voice as she pulled the 
petite blonde into a tight embrace that was both soothing and 
protective. 

&quot;Anything. Just ask me.&quot; Mumbled Rikku as she buried her face into the 
crook of Lulu&#39;s neck seeking shelter from her lover&#39;s piercing red 
eyes for fear she would cry if she stared into their depths for too 
much longer, taking a step back Lulu placed the palms of her hands on 
either side of Rikku&#39;s face forcing her to meet her soft gaze. 

&quot;Promise me, promise me that you won&#39;t talk like that ever again. Sin 
feeds on sorrow and despair, if you give up hope now, you won&#39;t make 
it to see the everlasting calm, please Rikku don&#39;t give up hope, we 
will find a way to save Lady Yuna, we just have to ride this out until 
we can find that way. Do you understand me? I want you to stop 
worrying about what awaits us tomorrow and enjoy what you have today. 
Promise me that?&quot; Hoarsely pleaded Lulu as her voice cracked causing 
her eyes to swell with unshed tears that she barely had the strength 
to hold back anymore, nodding her head slightly the young Al-Bhed 
gently leaned in kisses trails down the fair skinned woman&#39;s ivory 
cheeks before she tenderly placed a soft comforting kiss on the mage&#39;s 
mouth. 

&quot;I promise,&quot; Whispered Rikku as she continued to let her lips roam 
over the older guardian&#39;s face. &quot;But you have to promise me something 
too.&quot; Stated the young blonde as she stopped her tender assault, the 
act of speech long forgotten Lulu merely nodded her head as she 
helpless stared into Rikku&#39;s spiraling blue hues that she never seemed 
to fully get enough of. &quot;You have to promise me, that you will 
remember it is okay to need to cry, I told you once I don&#39;t want you 
to hide in that dark shell of yours&#133;Lulu, you don&#39;t have t hide who 
you are from me, I know that you are strong but even the strongest of 
us need to cry sometimes. So please stop trying to protect me so much 
and let me start to protect you too.&quot; Cooed the blonde Al-Bhed in a 
deep voice that didn&#39;t seem to fit her youthful demeanor in the 
slightest, with a sluggish nod the black mage tilted her head downward 
as she reached up and cupped both of Rikku&#39;s cheeks with the palms of 
her hands again.

&quot;I promise.&quot; Lulu retorted in a somber tone that was low and slightly 
quivering, gazing at the fair skinned woman the young blonde inwardly 
smiled as she saw tears trickled down Lulu&#39;s face and collect at the 
underside of her chin. Leaning in the younger of the two woman gently 
kisses the glistening path of tears until the skin under her lips was 
dry again, pulling the petite guardian back with shaking hands the 
ebony haired sorceress smiled weakly taking in the sight of the 
younger girl in front of her, the passion filled gaze that locked onto 
Rikku caused her to flush a neon pink and take a sudden childlike 
expression that was nothing short of innocent.

&quot;What are you thinking about Lulu?&quot; Inquired the blonde Al-Bhed as she 
felt her heart start to race in her chest as the fire shimmering in 
her lover&#39;s red orbs held an intensity that could have melted the sun 
itself, a low rumble of a laugh escaped Lulu&#39;s barely parted lips as 
she heard the younger girl&#39;s voice squeak with what sounded like 
nervousness. 

&quot;I am pondering what heavenly deity created such perfection in one 
being and would bless a creature like myself with being able to bask 
in the warm glow of that perfection. I am so incredibly lucky to have 
you here with me, I love you so much Rikku.&quot; Murmured Lulu as she 
stroked the younger woman&#39;s cheek with her thumb feeling the heat 
radiating from her flushing face. 

&quot;Oh shush you&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot; Gigged Rikku as she tilted her head 
and playfully bit the older woman&#39;s fragile looking hands, lightly 
grazing her eyeteeth over the tender flesh of the pale mage&#39;s slender 
digits the young thief carefully pushed the black manned sorceress 
against the flat of a nearby wall smiling wolfishly as she pulled her 
mouth away from Lulu&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you to get those thoughts out of your head? Do you even 
take into consideration the types of repercussions there will be if we 
get caught?&quot; Inquired Lulu in a strict tone that cause Rikku to pull 
away lightly with an expression of guilt on her pretty youthful face, 
with a light frown the ebony haired witch took a step forward closing 
the distance between her body and that of the younger guardian; 
quickly wrapping her arms around the blonde girl&#39;s thin waist pulling 
her lithe frame with her as she leaned back against the wall behind 
her.

 A shocked gasp filled Lulu&#39;s ears as she grabbed Rikku&#39;s rear and 
gave it a firm squeeze before she lifted the blonde Al-Bhed a few 
millimeters off the ground, a suave smirk inched itself across the 
ivory skinned mage&#39;s face as she felt the petite blonde drape her 
slender arms around her neck pulling her closer. Keeping one hand 
firmly gripping Rikku&#39;s backside Lulu tenderly slid her other hand up 
the girl&#39;s back eliciting a small shiver from the blonde thief, 
moaning in response from the movement Rikku bowed her head as she 
vigorously began to lapped at the hallow of Lulu&#39;s neck causing the 
ebony haired woman to arch forward as she tilted her head back 
whimpering in pleasure. 

&quot;Can you two not keep your hands off each for longer than ten 
minutes!?&quot; Snapped a sudden voice as the electric door clicked open 
revealing a highly enraged Yuna, waving her staff around madly the 
young summoner approached the two lovers who were detangling 
themselves from each other at a speed never before seen.

&quot;Lady Yuna please it isn&#39;t what it looks like,&quot; Lulu declared in a low 
calm tone as she looked at Yuna with a pleading expression gracing her 
colour lacking face, crossing her arms over her small chest the 
daughter of High Summoner Braska raised an eyebrow at the black mage 
very doubtfully.

&quot;Look down.&quot; Commanded Yuna as she closed her blue and green hues as 
if suddenly hit with a surge of pain, doing as instructed Lulu&#39;s 
cheeks reddened as she saw her own unclad breasts in view for everyone 
to see, pulling her fur trimmed dress over her bust the ebony 
sorceress glanced over to an equally flushing Rikku who looked at the 
ground embarrassedly.

&quot;Lady Yuna, please hear me out for a moment&#133;.&quot; Began Lulu as her heart 
throbbed in her throat making it tighten to the point swallowing was 
difficult, cutting the black haired woman off with a glare and a 
high-pitch voice the young aeon summoner turned her back to the two 
women.

&quot;I will expect the both of you to be presentable in five minutes, 
Rikku your father wishes to speak to you and as for you Lulu&#133;come see 
me on the bridge.&quot; With that Yuna stepped out of the room leaving Lulu 
and Rikku standing with looks of doom on their faces.

&quot;Tell me one thing.&quot; Choked out the mage as she cleared her throat 
feeling a sudden wave of almost nausea hit her head on.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Whispered the blonde Al-Bhed as she straitened her 
braids and goggles nervously.

&quot;How did you get my top down?&quot; Inquired Lulu with sincere curiosity 
glinting in her red eyes, flashing an impish grin Rikku cantered her 
head to the left as she looked at her baffled lover.

&quot;My teeth.&quot; Simply replied the young Al-Bhed as she marched passed 
Lulu giving her a sly wink, sighing heavily the black mage touch her 
fingertips to her forehead and gently rubbed between her eyes as she 
tried to ward off the on coming headache.

&quot;I should have known.&quot; Lamely retorted Lulu; as she let out a soft 
giggle that caused Rikku to whip around grinning wildly. 

&quot;Yup, you should have.&quot; Teased the younger of the two guardians in a 
mirthful tone that suddenly lacked nervousness of any kind, with a 
smile of her own Lulu moved her hand in a light waving motion as if to 
say &#39;what can I say to that&#39;. 

&quot;Just one more thing though,&quot; Stated Lulu in a suddenly humourless 
voice, nodding Rikku leaned in as if expecting her girlfriend to 
whisper the question. &quot;Your pants are unzipped, just thought you ought 
to know before you go see Cid.&quot; Calmly declared the ebony haired witch 
as she smiled warmly and gently kissed the young girl&#39;s cheek before 
she coolly strolled off towards the automatic door.

&quot;Wha&#133;How the&#133;Lulu!&quot; Screeched Rikku in a high-pitched voice as she 
quickly fastened her pants and gawked at the fair complexioned mage, 
turning her head over her shoulder Lulu gave the young blonde a sultry 
wink.

&quot;Some secrets are best never reviled.&quot; Stated Lulu in a husky voice 
that dripped with playfulness and a subtle mysterious nature to it, 
blinking Rikku slapped her forehead overdramatically and gave an 
exasperated sigh. 

&quot;I should have known,&quot; Groaned the petite thief as she mimicked the 
black mage&#39;s earlier statement. &quot;Though I still have one up on you.&quot; 
Grinned Rikku as she started to laugh, raising a slender eyebrow Lulu 
turned to the Al-Bhed girl confusedly. 

&quot;Have you now? And prey tell how is that?&quot; Inquired the dark haired 
woman as she brushed a tress of hair out of her face, laughing harder 
Rikku shook her head and gripped her sides lightly.

&quot;If you remember clearly, you did  have a bra on.&quot; Rikku declared as 
she stopped herself from laughing long enough to look at the 
expression on Lulu&#39;s face, bursting out into hysterics as the black 
mage&#39;s mouth sudden hung agape the blonde Al-Bhed pointed to the 
corner where she had thrown the undergarment. 

&quot;You never cease to amaze me Rikku.&quot; Uttered Lulu as she walked over 
to her article of clothing and shook her head, picking her bra off the 
floor the sorceress looked it over with a scanning red eye, pulling on 
the undergarment as she seductively walked back to where Rikku was 
standing Lulu clasped the last hook of her bra and gave the teenager a 
look of complete astonishment. With a laugh Rikku threw her head back 
and bellowed out in a fake accent as she struck a very familiar pose.

&quot;I&#39;m good, ya?&quot; Giggled the Al-Bhed as she copied Wakka&#39;s winning pose 
with perfection, unable to take the humour of the situation Lulu 
covered her eyes with her hands trying to keep from cracking up at the 
sight of her girlfriend mimicking the tan Beside guardian.

&quot;We better go, and promise me you will never do that again, ever.&quot; 
Chuckled Lulu as she tried to breath in even strides but failed 
miserably, nodding lightly Rikku pounced on the black mage hugging her 
tightly and kissing her lips before she let go and rushed from the 
room like a bolt. 

&quot;About time girly, I&#39;ve been waiting for you for an hour now!&quot; Yelled 
Cid as he looked at his young daughter with a disapproving glint in 
his eyes, bowing her head with guile Rikku stared at her feet for a 
moment.

&quot;Sorry dad, but I didn&#39;t know where you were and I sort of was talking 
to Lulu earlier&#133;I kind of forgot that you wanted to talk to me about 
something. Sorry.&quot; Whispered Rikku as she scuffed at the floor 
sheepishly, shaking his head at the young blonde&#39;s actions the pilot 
of the Highwind slowly sighed as he lowered his manly frame into a 
chair. Just by the look on his face Rikku could tell that whatever he 
was about to tell her was serious, the young Al-Bhed had only seen 
that expression curse her father&#39;s facial features twice before and 
that was when her mother died and Home was destroyed. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I am just a bit on edge, take a seat, we are 
gonna be here for a while.&quot; Muttered Cid as he patted the chair next 
to his, silently nodding the blonde guardian walked over to where her 
father was and took the offered seat without question. 

&quot;So,&quot; Rikku breathed as she tried to keep her head from spinning. 
&quot;What is it you wanted to talk to me about?&quot; 

Looking up at a metal pipe running across the ceiling Cid touched his 
hand to the back of his neck as if trying to figure out what he indeed 
was trying to say to the younger Al-Bhed.

&quot;Rikku, you know, this isn&#39;t easy to say. But&#133;Yuna and I have been 
discussing a few things, and she has agreed to release you from your 
guardian duties.&quot; Muttered Cid in a shallow voice that was gruffer 
than anything Rikku had ever heard before.

&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Confusedly inquired the blonde as she 
suddenly felt like someone had knocked the air out of her; shutting 
his tired eyes Cid leaned back in his chair making it squeak in 
apposition, taking a long breath the bald man leveled his rattled and 
frayed nerves.

&quot;I mean, Yuna and I have decided that it is best for you to stay here, 
on the airship where it is safer. I know that I told you to take care 
of Yuna and make sure nothing happens to her, but I don&#39;t want to lose 
you too, like I did your mother. Yuna knew what she was getting into 
when she started her pilgrimage, she knew that to beat Sin she would 
have to sacrifice herself; it isn&#39;t fair to have to drag you into that 
sort of situation too.&quot; Grumbled the older Al-Bhed in a deep voice as 
he cracked open an orb to look at his daughter, the sight that greeted 
his eyes wasn&#39;t has he had expected, she wasn&#39;t throwing a temper 
tantrum or yelling in the least Rikku just started ahead of her with a 
bleak expression on her face. 

&quot;No,&quot; Rasped out the pretty thief as she looked to her father with a 
certain fire burning in her cool blue eyes. &quot;Dad, this isn&#39;t all about 
us. We have to think about Spira, and if saving the planet means that 
we have to make sacrifices than so be it! I don&#39;t want to see Yunnie 
die, I don&#39;t want to see anyone die, but if me and the others don&#39;t 
stop Sin that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen. The world will end and the only 
calm that will come is the one of death, I refuse to give up now 
because that is what Sin wants us to do. If we give up hope then we 
have already lost the fight before it has even begun, and I sure as 
Godhand am not going to give in to what that monster wants!&quot; 
Definitely shouted Rikku as she stood up and glared at Cid, taking to 
his own feet the bald man stared at the sandy manned girl with a 
strict expression on his aged face.

&quot;You are still my child and you will obey my wishes! Do you understand 
me? I don&#39;t want to have to force you to stay here but if that is what 
it boils down to then I have no choice in the matter!&quot; Yelled Cid as 
he loomed over the petite teenager in order to gain dominance over 
her, taking a step back Rikku placed her hands on her hips and sized 
her father up with a scanning gaze.

&quot;I am my own woman, I don&#39;t have to take orders from you just because 
I am your daughter. You have no right to try and force me to stay here 
against my will, I love you dad but you can&#39;t keep me away from my 
destiny. And if you have to disown me so that I may complete my 
mission then go ahead, because no matter what you do I am going to 
continued being Yunnie&#39;s guardian and you can&#39;t stop me from doing 
that.&quot; Retorted the blonde girl as she gave Cid a warning look before 
she turned and walked towards the exit, with a rough slap the Highwind 
pilot reached out and clamped his large hand around Rikku&#39;s thin wrist 
pulling her to a sudden halt.

&quot;You&#39;re not a baby anymore, but you will always be my little girl, no 
matter how old you get. But, you are right, I have no say so whether 
or not you go off and fight Sin or stay here. I just want what is best 
for you, and so does Yuna that is why she agreed to dismiss you as her 
guardian. But you are an adult now, capable of making your own choices 
in life, and if wanting to help destroy Sin is one of those decisions 
than I will just have to stand by it. Even if I don&#39;t fully agree with 
it.&quot; Declared Cid as he loosened his grip on his daughter&#39;s wrist and 
slowly sauntered backwards.

&quot;Oh dad.&quot; Mumbled Rikku in a low voice as she looked at the older 
Al-Bhed with a soft gaze that was laced with unshed tears, taking a 
step forward the energetic thief wrapped her thin arms around her 
father&#39;s waist and hugged him tightly. 

&quot;Yeah, yeah, enough of this mushy stuff.&quot; Chuckled Cid in a dry tone 
that was almost humourless, letting the older man go Rikku pulled back 
and looked at the older man with her brow furrowing feverously in deep 
thought.

&quot;Dad&#133;did you really mean that you will stand by any choices that I 
make?&quot; Shyly inquired the blonde guardian as she bit her bottom lip 
nervously.

&quot;Yeah&#133;I did. Why do you ask?&quot; Questionably stated Cid as he raised an 
eyebrow at his daughter&#39;s demeanor, taking in a deep breath Rikku 
placed her hands behind her back.

&quot;Well, um it is like this, ya see, um, me and&#133;ah&#133;the thing is&#133;it is 
kind of like this&#133;ugh! Dad I am involved with someone, and this 
someone is also a guardian and I just want you to&#133;ah&#133;I really love 
them&#133;and please don&#39;t get mad at me!&quot; Rambled the young Al-Bhed in a 
fast shaking jumble of words, blinking back a shocked look Cid 
clutched his fist together as the thought of some man pawing at his 
only daughter.

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Asked the bald man in a subtle yell causing Rikku to 
slowly edge her way backwards.

&quot;Um, guess.&quot; Nervously declared the blonde girl, seeing her father 
blow a gasket Rikku made a throaty squeak.

&quot;I am not playing games Rikku, tell me how the hell that bastard is 
and I will chop off his&#133;.&quot; Raved Cid as he grabbed his daughter by her 
shoulders and held her from running away, squirming the young thief 
paled and began to cry slightly.

&quot;I am not telling you unless you promise me that you will not 
hurt&#133;whoever it is.&quot; Stuttered Rikku in a firm tone that caused Cid to 
narrow his tired eyes at the girl he was all but pinning to the very 
spot she stood on.

&quot;FINE!!! I PROMISE, NOW TELL ME FOR THE LOVE OF MECHINA!!!&quot; Roared Cid 
with rage infused in each word he screamed, flinching Rikku looked 
down causing tears to roll down her cheeks.

&quot;Well the good news is I will never get pregnant,&quot; Whispered the pale 
blonde half jokingly, which earned her a harsh glare. &quot;Lulu.&quot; Murmured 
Rikku in a voice that was so soft that Cid almost didn&#39;t believe his 
ears.

&quot;Wha&#133;?&quot; Stuttered Cid as he suddenly found himself unable to speak. 

&quot;Dad, I&#39;m a lesbian.&quot;        

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s notes: Okay I know I promised some Brother bashing in this 
chapter, but I decided the drag the series on for a few more chapters. 
I want to give everyone closure when Lulu finally does beat the snot 
out of Rikku&#39;s brother&#133;I want a full chapter dedicated to nothing but 
beating the boy into pulp then humiliating him in front of everyone. 
And I think this way I can fully utilize the next chapter, not only 
that but everything will tie in better than if I just continued the 
third part. Thank you all for your replies to my story&#133;it really means 
the world to me. Thanks!
