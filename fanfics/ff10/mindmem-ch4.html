<h1>Mindful of Memories (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/imogene.html">Imogene</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff10/mindmem-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Zidane carried the limp child toward the room where the mirror stood 
with silent determination. Under the grimace, however, was a nervous 
heart. He was going against the wishes of his own wife to do this. &#39;Even 
if it succeeds,&#39; he thought, &#39;It will still have been the wrong thing to 
do.&#39;

Yet something else urged him forward, his entourage of guards following 
close behind. The two girls whispered to each other as the group 
approached the storeroom. The big guard stood by the door just as Zidane 
reached for the handle.

&quot;Are you quite sure you want to do this?&quot;

Zidane looked back over his shoulder. He lowered his head, turned to the 
door opened it. The guards stepped inside took a place either side of 
the mirror. One drew his sword.

&quot;What&#39;s going on do you reckon?&quot; Yuffie whispered as Zidane carried the 
child inside.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t look good.&quot; Rikku whispered back. They watched 
from the doorway. Zidane knelt down in front of the mirror; its surface 
was pitch black and not reflective. He cradled Eiko in his arms and 
waited.

&quot;Are you there?&quot; Zindane asked with a calm, quiet voice. The mirror 
remained black but a whisper drifted from it, too soft to hear.

&quot;Are you there?&quot; Zidane asked again. He shifted his weight a little.

&quot;Let me see her.&quot; The mirror whispered. The voice was quiet and 
indistinct.

Zidane held the child toward the mirror as best he could. She remained 
draped across his arms like wet laundry.

&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; The mirror whispered. Zidane closed his eyes, they 
remained closed for many seconds, when he opened them again he said,

&quot;I do. I trust you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, please don&#39;t move. This might not be pleasant.&quot; The mirror 
spoke louder this time, images of a light haired boy flickered across 
the surface. Zidane watched, frozen. The guards were poised to strike.

&quot;I won&#39;t move, no-one will move.&quot; Zidane watched the mirror&#39;s image as 
it revealed the image of his brother, who stared back out at him, his 
face calm and sullen. The image looked out at the room and at the child 
for a moment.

At once the boy in the mirror reached through the mirror&#39;s surface, his 
translucent arm dived right into Eiko&#39;s head and returned holding and 
pulling at streaks of red firey rope.

&quot;Kuja!&quot; Zidane yelled as his balance wavered, Eiko jolted awake, Kuja 
reached his other arm out and pulled on the twisting, tangled web of 
fire that was emerging from the child&#39;s head. The fire whipped around, 
trying to escape Kuja&#39;s grip as he pulled it into the mirror. As he 
pulled one handful into the mirror, he let it go and it flailed against 
the inner surface, trapped inside. He reached out again, pulling more 
and more of... whatever it was... from the girl. The guards stood, 
mouths open, silent and still.

Eiko let out a scream as the one last, coiled tendril of fire was 
dragged from her mind and pulled back into the mirror. She collapsed 
onto Zidane&#39;s lap, awake and sobbing. Kuja&#39;s image flickered in the 
mirror. The coils of fire lashed at the surface as though they were 
trying to get back. Kuja had a firm grip of one part that writhed around 
in his hand.

&quot;What ... did you just do?&quot; the guard yelled. Zidane picked the crying 
child up and wiped a hand across her cheek. She looked up at him. She 
sniffed. Her little arm reached up and rubbed at her head.

&quot;It was living inside her mind.&quot; Kuja stated. &quot;It was her fear come to 
life.&quot;

Zidane looked up at the mirror. He opened his mouth and just stared at 
the writhing mess that lashed out against the glass from the inside.

&quot;Wh... how?&quot; Zidane felt his chest aching as his heart steadied itself.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. There is something ... some kind of force... it brought 
me to life also. I can&#39;t say how, I can only say...&quot; Kuja&#39;s image faded 
as he wrestled with the tangled mess he held in his arms and faded into 
black, dark silence. The mirror whispered one last statement, &quot;It is 
born from your memories.&quot;

&quot;What is born?&quot; Zidane asked. He reached forward and touched the icy 
cold glass. The mirror only reflected his hand back at him. Eiko sobbed 
and sniffed against his chest.

&quot;Are you feeling okay kid?&quot; Zidane looked down into her eyes. She opened 
them wide as she looked up at him, then past him and up at the ceiling. 
She smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s gone.&quot; She stated as she sniffed again. The little smile widened.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Rikku stepped into the room a little way. She was 
shaking from the ordeal as much as Zidane.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Some kind of ghost. Something about ... a memory of hers 
that came to life.&quot; Zidane mused, almost to himself. &quot;But I don&#39;t have 
memories of Kuja being nice. In fact ... I don&#39;t have many memories of 
him at all.&quot;

&quot;She was afraid of fire?&quot; Rikku looked down at Eiko, who continued to 
stare up at the ceiling with happy, teary eyes.

&quot;Well who knows what it was to start with. Something in the air I 
guess... something big and firey up in the ... oh... the Invincible...&quot; 
Zidane looked down at Eiko. &quot;We dismantled it Eiko. It can&#39;t hurt you.&quot; 
He wondered if she even knew what it was herself. All that time they 
thought she was just having some kind of breakdown from the stress of 
being around other humans again. The doctors had told them she needed to 
&#39;have a childhood&#39; and so on, then they assumed it was Cid&#39;s sleaziness 
causing her stress and she&#39;d come to live with Zidane and Garnet. &#39;All 
that time it was just... a ghost in her head.&#39; Zidane hugged Eiko to his 
chest and closed his eyes.

She hugged him back. &quot;It&#39;s gone!&quot;

Zidane was deep in thought as he carried the tired child back to their 
room. He thought about how he was going to explain this to Garnet for 
one thing. How was he going to stop this... thing from coming back. 
Perhaps he needed to explain to Eiko, what she was afraid of and why she 
shouldn&#39;t be afraid any more. No fear, no ghosts. He sighed. It didn&#39;t 
explain why Kuja, or at least his &#39;ghost&#39;, was acting like that. Though, 
he could feel the answer on the tip of his mind, waiting for a quiet 
moment to present itself to him. Rikku and Yuffie trailed behind, lost 
and confused.

&quot;That was pretty freaky right?&quot; Rikku asked, wanting only to break the 
silence with conversation.

&quot;Yep. But I thought ghosts were like... someone&#39;s ... spirit or 
something. Not just a memory.&quot; Yuffie mused.

&quot;I don&#39;t know either. Its all so confusing, you know, I mean, for one 
thing... why are we here?&quot; Rikku asked.

&quot;Hey you know, I wondered that... I reckon we&#39;re here to save the day. 
Like hero&#39;s and stuff!&quot; Yuffie grinned. Any adventure was good. 
Adventure meant life could wait for a while. That was also good. Life 
was getting complicated, adventures were easy.

&quot;But what brought us here? Didn&#39;t he say the mirror showed him where we 
were? I wonder if that ghost man brought us here?&quot; Rikku continued.

&quot;I dunno. Maybe. You know what? It doesn&#39;t matter why, we just are!&quot; 
Yuffie cheered up more and more.

&quot;But... it doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot; Rikku felt glad that Yuffie was 
reclaiming that spark she&#39;d seen in her eyes when they&#39;d met. It was 
enough to keep her going as well.

----------

Garnet slept on through the afternoon. Zidane took the three girls 
outside by the fountain to get some fresh air. Eiko watched the clouds 
and commented on the birds, the blueness of the sky, how warm the 
sunlight was. As though she&#39;d missed it.

&quot;It&#39;s as though that ghost, in her head, was ... there... wherever she 
looked it was there. No wonder she was so scared... but only sometimes. 
So sometimes it must have left her alone. She was getting worse 
though...so... so the ghost was growing? Maybe because once she&#39;d seen 
it... she believed in it.&quot; Zidane mumbled to himself. It seemed so wrong 
to have to just make up answers as he went along.

Rikku sat on the side of the fountain while Yuffie watched the water 
shooting into the air, falling as sparkling rain.

&quot;We&#39;ll find out who it is and kick their butts right?&quot; Yuffie said, she 
smiled at Rikku.

&quot;Sure. Yeh.&quot; Rikku felt the skin on her neck prickle up. &#39;Yeh so I can 
fall in love again and get crushed again.&#39; She sighed.

Yuffie noticed and watched her for a moment. &quot;You okay? Hey you don&#39;t 
have to worry, you have no idea how much butt I can kick. Aint nothing 
gunna stand in my way. Ba-boom, you&#39;ll see!&quot; Yuffie punched at the air.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Rikku grinned. Somehow, that spark, it lit fires inside Rikku 
that she could do nothing about. There they burned away, hot fire in her 
heart. Rikku could feel the start of the wildfire. &#39;I don&#39;t think I can 
cope with that again.&#39; She stood up and walked away.

&quot;Hey, where&#39;re you going?&quot; Yuffie called out, she flicked water at 
Rikku&#39;s legs.

&quot;Is she your friend?&quot; Eiko asked.

&quot;Yeh. She&#39;s kinda wimpy though. I&#39;m gunna have to teach her a lot of 
stuff.&quot; Yuffie watched Rikku wander back inside.

&quot;Oh... You&#39;re going to go find out what was going on? I&#39;m going too.&quot;

&quot;Yeh right brat! As if!!&quot; Yuffie laughed.

Eiko was visibly annoyed. &quot;I&#39;m not useless ya know!&quot;

&quot;Sure kid. Hey. Your dad&#39;s calling you.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s n... oh okay.&quot; Eiko ran to Zidane as he walked to Yuffie.

&quot;Hey. Where&#39;s Rikku?&quot; Zidane asked.

&quot;Dunno.&quot; Yuffie shrugged.

&quot;Well. She&#39;s awake now; I should go explain to her what happened. I 
might just get out of this alive hehe.&quot; Zidane laughed his nerves away.

----------

Yuffie returned to their bedroom. Rikku wasn&#39;t there. For a few moments 
she sat on Rikku&#39;s bed and imagined the great adventure ahead. There was 
something else, a little hint of something she&#39;d never thought about 
much before. Her heart seemed to jump a little when she thought of 
Rikku. Curious. It jumped a lot when she saw Rikku smile.

&quot;This is gunna be cool,&quot; she mumbled and wondered where Rikku had gone. 
As she left the room, one of the nurses pointed to a door, &quot;She&#39;s out on 
the balcony.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; Yuffie almost had to stop herself from skipping toward the door. 
Her smile widened when she opened it to reveal Rikku, sat in the corner 
of the balcony overlooking the courtyard below, her legs dangling down 
through the balustrade.

&quot;Hey there you are!&quot; Yuffie sat cross-legged down beside Rikku. Her 
smile vanished into her stomach when Rikku turned to face her, red 
faced, tears catching the sun. Rikku turned away again and stared out 
over the little rooftops.

&quot;Hey... are you scared?&quot; Yuffie asked. Rikku shook her head. She sniffed 
and shook her head again.

&quot;It&#39;s not... its nothing.&quot; Her voice was strained, broken, dissolving 
into sobs.

&quot;My arse it&#39;s nothing... what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Yuffie said, Rikku&#39;s tears 
seemed to be appearing inside her own eyes.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Rikku cried.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be scared.&quot;

Rikku turned to Yuffie with such a look of pain in her eyes that Yuffie 
found herself suddenly overwhelmed. Life had gone and got confusing 
again. When Rikku looked away again, Yuffie felt compelled to say, or 
do, something. She could only watch. Rikku cried to herself while Yuffie 
sat beside her and looked out over the rooftops.

&quot;I&#39;m cursed.&quot; Rikku coughed out.

&quot;Cursed? Well we&#39;ll just cure it eh?&quot; Yuffie smiled again.

&quot;You ... have no idea.&quot; Rikku sniffed and turned her attention back to 
the rooftops.

&quot;What kind of curse?&quot; Yuffie asked after the silence elongated longer 
than her curiosity could hold out.

&quot;Cursed. There&#39;s no cure. Just cursed. Doomed.&quot; Rikku&#39;s head slumped 
forward and collided with one of the balustrades.

&quot;How?&quot; Yuffie&#39;s mind raced. She&#39;d find a cure. Cant be doomed, not 
Rikku!

&quot;I fa... I ... I fall in love.&quot; Rikku stuttered out. Yuffie waited.

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;I fall in love.&quot; Rikku repeated.

&quot;How is that a curse?&quot;

&quot;With girls.&quot; Rikku forced the words out against their wishes. They hung 
in the air for a while.

Yuffie considered the statement. Tasting it on her lips. &#39;With girls eh? 
Well.&#39;

&quot;Oh. Weird curse. Where&#39;d you get a curse like that?!&quot; She blurted.

&quot;Well... I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s just who I am. I was born like this, I&#39;ll die 
like it.&quot; Rikku dissolved once more into sobbing.

&quot;You won&#39;t die! Seriously... hang on a minute. You were born with a 
curse?&quot; Yuffie asked.

&quot;No! It&#39;s not a curse. It just feels like a curse.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Yuffie tasted the flavour of the curse again. She shrugged.

&quot;I dunno, I reckon that would be kinda cool. Girls are way hotter than 
guys. Guys are gross anyway. How come it makes you so miserable?&quot; Yuffie 
mused.

&quot;Imagine falling in love with someone who doesn&#39;t love you back. Then 
watching them... fall in ... love ... with someone else!&quot; Rikku sobbed.

&quot;Oh. Well. I&#39;ve never been in love. Love&#39;s not my thing ya know. Icky. 
So were you in love with someone and they loved someone else?&quot; Yuffie 
asked, then she added, &quot;A friend of mine had that happen to her.&quot;

Rikku barely heard anything Yuffie said, so deep into her own misery. 
Familiar territory, down there in the dark.

Yuffie watched over her as she sobbed to herself. All the time, 
wondering, imagining, tasting something new. Imagine falling in love 
with a girl. A new thought. Strange new thought. Yuffie had never 
bothered to consider. Why would she? Love was icky... wasn&#39;t it?

&#39;I wonder why it&#39;s made her cry all of a sudden. I reckon she likes a 
girl... oh wow. I wonder if she likes me.&#39; Yuffie considered it for a 
moment. She had nowhere in her mind to store such an idea. It floated 
away.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been in love.&quot; Yuffie&#39;s voice floated out into the silence.

&quot;It hurts.&quot; Rikku whispered.

&quot;Then why does anyone bother?&quot; Yuffie asked.

&quot;They can&#39;t help it, it just happens.&quot; Rikku sniffed and turned to 
Yuffie. Yuffie tilted her head and smiled. It was enough to send a fresh 
wave of tears to Rikku&#39;s eyes.

Yuffie found the strange new thought so electric that it frightened her 
and she found herself ignoring it. She then decided to assume that 
stress was the cause of Rikku&#39;s distress.

&quot;There you are... are you okay?&quot; Zidane stepped out onto the balcony.

&quot;It&#39;s private.&quot; Yuffie snapped. Rikku sniffed and wiped at her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;

&quot;I just came to ... are you sure? It&#39;ll be okay. We&#39;ll get to the bottom 
of this for sure.&quot;

Rikku nodded. It was easier to just go along with it.

&quot;Did you talk to Garnet? Did she chuck one?&quot; Yuffie asked, avoiding any 
hint at decorum.

&quot;Yeh... she was... kinda hurt more than anything. But Eiko&#39;s so much 
better. So I think she&#39;ll forgive me. She knows I wouldn&#39;t do anything 
to hurt either of them. But still.&quot; Zidane rubbed at his head. One bit 
of the puzzle had been solved at least.

&quot;So now what do we do?&quot; Yuffie asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I think I&#39;ll go back and try and talk to Kuja. I wondered 
if you could come along.&quot; Zidane watched Rikku, she nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, rest first. When you&#39;re feeling better. We&#39;ll have dinner 
together maybe, talk about it some more?&quot; Zidane gave the girls a grin 
and walked back inside.

&quot;Cool. See Rikku? It&#39;ll take your mind off things, we&#39;ll kick butt. Then 
you can take out all your worries on some... thing.&quot; Yuffie slapped 
Rikku&#39;s back and ... her hand stayed there just a fraction longer, of 
it&#39;s own accord. For that fraction of a second, Yuffie froze solid while 
her world filled with the feeling of her hand against Rikku&#39;s warm body.

&quot;I&#39;ll teach you everything there is to know about kicking butt.&quot; Yuffie 
said, her voice was a little shakier than before.

&quot;I kick butt pretty good already.&quot; Rikku said, taking a deep breath. It 
felt good to have cried. She was lighter. But. Yuffie&#39;s smile made her 
chest ache.

----------

For the first time since their arrival, Yuffie and Rikku ate at the 
dining table with Zidane and Garnet. They were also joined by close 
friends of the family. The large guard with the tired face was 
introduced as Aldebert Steiner. His wife, Beatrix, sat beside him with a 
look of stern concentration.

&quot;The are others... if we need help.&quot; Beatrix mumbled to herself.

&#39;Help with what though? They don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re trying to 
fight!&#39;, Rikku considered the situation as she picked at her food. It 
kept her mind off... other things. She wondered if Yuffie might be 
right, that they&#39;d been picked to fight whatever it was... but who by?

&quot;We should go back to the tree, that&#39;s where all this started.&quot; Eiko 
stated.

&quot;Eiko.&quot; Garnet spoke without looking up.

&quot;I&#39;m going, I&#39;m not sick any more! We fought it before and... &quot; Eiko 
demanded.

&quot;No-ones going near it until we know what&#39;s going on.&quot; Zidane 
interrupted.

Garnet looked up,  &quot;But it&#39;s all dead. There&#39;s nothing left but rubble.&quot;

&quot;What tree?&quot; Yuffie asked through a mouthful of food.

&quot;Where you were found, there was once... a tree. Of sorts.&quot; Zidane began 
to explain.

&quot;Oh yeh! There was all bits of dead tree all over the place - all these 
roots and stuff under the ground... and that glowing pool of ... 
whatever it was. It all caved in anyway.&quot; Yuffie said through more food.

&quot;Glowing pool?&quot; Zidane glared at Yuffie. He looked back at Garnet with 
the same wide unblinking stare.

&quot;I dunno what it was.&quot; Yuffie mumbled.

&quot;It looked like it was ... as deep as...like it went on forever.&quot; Rikku 
added.

&quot;But that&#39;s impossible.&quot; Garnet said.

&quot;Well it only looked like it went forever I mean it could of just...&quot;

Zidane interrupted Yuffie&#39;s mumbling, &quot;No, that&#39;s not what she meant.&quot;

&quot;Yeh! It&#39;s dead! Isn&#39;t it?&quot; Eiko yelled.

&quot;Yes Eiko, it is.&quot; Zidane said.

&quot;Then what is going on?&quot; Steiner demanded. The room fell silent once 
more.

Rikku stared at her plate as she thought. She rubbed her temple as the 
aching worsened.

&#39;You&#39;re going to fall in love with her, and she won&#39;t love you back!&#39; 
Rikku felt herself think.
