<h1>The Trouble with Understanding (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff10/troubunder-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The boisterous laughter and conversation of her fellow cadets was giving 
Elma a headache. She leaned into the closest thing she could find, which 
was Tyhlan&#39;s shoulder. The blonde girl started in surprise for a moment 
before relaxing, gazing contemplatively at the bright bonfire in front 
of them. The stars and moon shone down on the camp, and smoke from the 
fire unfurled, dissipating into the night sky. The training for the day 
was over, and Lucil&#39;s trainees sat around lazily, swapping stories and 
jokes.

&quot;I wonder how the captain is doing,&quot; Clasko murmured quietly, tugging at 
his bootlaces. Kehni scoffed at his side and shrugged, chuckling under 
his breath.

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry! A bunch of stupid Sinspawn aren&#39;t gonna take the 
captain down! Isn&#39;t that right, everyone?&quot;

The other cadets cheered in agreement, and Elma rubbed her temples, 
frowning in frustration. There was something she had forgotten the night 
before, but she couldn&#39;t think of it. Tyhlan glanced down at her, her 
wide blue eyes flickering worriedly.

&quot;You okay, Elma? Maybe you should head to bed, you know?&quot;

Elma glanced up into the other girl&#39;s swirled irises, and suddenly 
remembered what she had forgotten. She shot up abruptly, and ran off, 
mumbling an apology to the others under her breath. Tyhlan blinked in 
surprise, and Kehni shook his head in confusion, running his fingers 
through his hair.

&quot;What&#39;s up with her?&quot;

--------------

Elma searched around the area she and Tyhlan had been in the night 
before, to no avail. The sphere was no where to be found. She had no 
idea how her superiors would treat Tyhlan if they knew she was half Al 
Bhed, and after hearing the story the blonde girl had told her 
yesterday, she had no desire to find out. She sat down on a rock and 
slumped her shoulders. Some friend she was. At worst, Elma herself would 
probably be kicked out of the Knighthood for keeping the secret, and who 
knew what they would do to poor Tyhlan?

&quot;What am I gonna do?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; another voice quietly asked. Elma glanced up quickly 
and noticed a tall, pale, dark-haired young woman standing a short 
distance away from her. By the look of her uniform, she was a rank above 
Elma, and she held the small sphere in one of her slender hands. &quot;Do you 
mean this?&quot; she remarked absently. She moved to flick the device on, but 
Elma lunged for it, trying in vain to wrench it from the woman&#39;s 
surprisingly strong grip.

&quot;Give it back!&quot;

The other girl pushed Elma away, straightening out her uniform shirt. 
&quot;Don&#39;t be so pushy,&quot; she said. &quot;All you have to do is ask.&quot;

Elma bit the inside of her mouth, suddenly embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Can 
I have it back?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s on it?&quot; the girl asked, glancing at it quizzically. &quot;I mean, you 
seem to want it back very much; there has to be something important on 
it.&quot;

Elma resisted the urge to tell the girl it was none of her business. 
&quot;It&#39;s just something personal.&quot;

&quot;I see. Alright then.&quot; The girl threw the sphere to Elma, who caught it 
easily. &quot;See you around then.&quot;

&quot;Elma!&quot; Tyhlan and Clasko made their way to her, both out of breath. 
Tyhlan scuttled over to Elma&#39;s side first, barely sparing the newcomer a 
passing glance. &quot;We were worried about you. Why&#39;d you take off like 
that?&quot;

Clasko nodded in agreement. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t run off like that, Elma,&quot; he 
admonished gently. &quot;Remember what the captain said about fiends, that 
they can attack anywhere. And you don&#39;t have your sword either!&quot;

Elma nodded her head, trying not to laugh at Clasko&#39;s over 
protectiveness, and hid the sphere behind her back, moving to follow her 
fellow cadets back to the main camp. Clasko glanced over at the strange 
girl, and stopped in his tracks, nudging Elma&#39;s shoulder gently to get 
her attention.

&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh...I...didn&#39;t ask her name.&quot; Elma frowned and turned toward the 
older girl. &quot;Um, I&#39;m Elma,&quot; she waved a hand to Clasko and Tyhlan in 
turn, &quot;And these are my friends, Clasko and Tyhlan. What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Reia.&quot; The girl muttered. Her gaze settled on Tyhlan. &quot;A pleasure to 
meet you.&quot; She didn&#39;t move to glance at the others however, and stared 
intently at Tyhlan, until the blonde girl started to fidget.

&quot;Is there, um....something wrong?&quot; Tyhlan asked, grinning warily.

&quot;You&#39;re just...very pretty,&quot; Reia remarked offhandedly. Her cool, light 
gray eyes flickered strangely for a moment. &quot;You have unusual eyes. I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anything like it before.&quot;

&quot;Oh, er, um...thank you, I guess?&quot; Tyhlan stammered, flushing in 
embarrassment. She grabbed Clasko and Elma and started to tug them along 
with her. &quot;Nice meeting you! But we have to go and, uh, yeah...&quot; When 
she was sure the girl was out of earshot, she pulled Elma close and 
whispered, &quot;Where&#39;d you find that one? She&#39;s creepy...&quot;

&quot;I think so too,&quot; Clasko mumbled.

Elma shrugged helplessly, but couldn&#39;t help but feel a small flicker of 
panic. The girl had mentioned Tyhlan&#39;s eyes...what if she told? &quot;I guess 
she was kinda weird, huh?&quot; she asked, hoping the other two couldn&#39;t hear 
the frantic edge in her voice. She would have to find that girl again 
tomorrow. There was...no way she could let anything bad happen, not 
after Tyhlan had confided in her. She would feel betrayed, all because 
of Elma&#39;s own carelessness. She wondered what the captain would say 
about the situation she had gotten herself into, and imagined her 
frowning at her in disapproval, just as she had at the beginning of her 
training when she had fallen behind to assist Clasko. She winced.

&quot;You alright, Elma?&quot; Tyhlan asked. Elma bit her lip and forced a smile.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just fine!&quot;

----------------

The next day was a flurry of activity, and Elma was finding it difficult 
to slip away. Word had come in that the fighting at Mi&#39;hen had ceased, 
and everyone was working hard to prepare for the wounded. White mages 
and alchemists had been called in to assist, and Elma had been scolded 
by a mage when she had tried to leave.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have work to do, girl?&quot; he had said to her. &quot;If you don&#39;t, go 
get supplies for me, understand?&quot;

She was now stuck getting medicinal supplies, and she groaned in 
frustration, angrily organizing the miscellaneous items.

&quot;What&#39;s that now girl? Calm down! No need to rush!&quot; the mage said 
sharply. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Elma,&quot; she responded, trying not to scream when a roll of gauze 
loosened. She set to work rolling it back up, grumbling under her 
breath.

&quot;So impatient,&quot; the man said, sighing. &quot;You remind me of my daughter. 
She&#39;s quite the hellion. I bet you&#39;ve got a good head on your shoulders 
though, not like mine. Doesn&#39;t want to study in the temples to follow 
the family line. Probably stealing, I know that&#39;s what she&#39;s doing. 
Doesn&#39;t even write anymore...&quot; he frowned in disgust. &quot;Stupid girl.&quot; He 
paused for a moment, and then finally introduced himself. &quot;Where are my 
manners, I&#39;m--&quot;

&quot;Hey! Elma!&quot; Tyhlan rushed into the tent, her face flushed from running. 
&quot;Guess what?&quot;

Elma glanced up, startled. &quot;W-what? What is it?&quot; Tyhlan trotted over to 
her and helped her to her feet, dragging her to the tent&#39;s exit.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you! Come on!&quot;

The mage cleared his throat. &quot;Young lady,&quot; he began, giving Elma a 
pointed look. Elma sighed and slumped her shoulders.

&quot;Sorry Tyhlan, but whatever it is has to wait. I have...work to do.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, come on, old man! This is really important! Can you please let 
Elma come with me? We&#39;ll be back...hey, I&#39;ll even help if you let us 
go!&quot;

The man frowned, glancing at the two young women. &quot;...Alright then,&quot; he 
said, after some hesitation, &quot;but you better keep good on your promise, 
girl.&quot;

&quot;Right, sure! Come on, Elma!&quot;

---------------

After Tyhlan had dragged her back to the main camp, Elma finally decided 
to ask what the rush was all about.

&quot;What&#39;s the big deal, Tyhlan? Why are you pulling me around so fast?&quot;

Tyhlan grabbed Elma&#39;s shoulders and pointed her straight ahead. &quot;Look 
who&#39;s back.&quot;

Elma stared ahead, and her eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Captain...&quot; she 
whispered.

Lucil was standing a short distance away, near a group of soldiers and 
chocobos, issuing orders and directing the wounded to mages. She looked 
exhausted however, her armor was splattered with dry blood, and 
scratches were etched across her face. When she noticed her two cadets, 
she smiled weakly and walked toward them, and Elma winced when she 
noticed she was limping.

&quot;Cadets,&quot; Lucil greeted evenly. The two girls saluted, but Elma couldn&#39;t 
help but ask about Lucil&#39;s injuries.

&quot;Are you alright, Captain?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m quite alright, cadet,&quot; Lucil muttered, closing her eyes for a 
moment. &quot;I could be a lot worse. Nothing a potion won&#39;t fix,&quot; she added, 
when she noticed Tyhlan glancing at her wounded leg. &quot;And you two? Have 
you been faring well? The trainer, has he taught you anything?&quot;

&quot;Uh, we&#39;re fine captain,&quot; Tyhlan answered, &quot;but...with all due respect 
ma&#39;am, you probably should go get your leg looked at. My mom told me 
once that you can lose limbs from Sinspawn poison. Err, we can help you 
to a tent, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You , I suppose. I am rather tired,&quot; Lucil admitted, glancing from one 
girl to the other. Elma nodded quickly and turned.

&quot;You can follow me, captain. I was assisting a mage earlier; he can 
probably fix you up, good as new!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tyhlan agreed, and then groaned, shaking her head. &quot;Ah, geez, we 
still have to help that guy, don&#39;t we? Me and my big mouth...&quot;

Elma shrugged helplessly. &quot;It&#39;s no big deal. He&#39;s not really that bad.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess...&quot;

Lucil glanced from one girl to the other in slight confusion. &quot;I beg 
your pardon?&quot;

&quot;Uh, nothing captain,&quot; Tyhlan said quickly. &quot;We should get you to that 
mage!&quot;

-----------------

The two girls, Lucil realized, got along quite well. That girl, 
Tyhlan...she had only seen blonde hair on occasion, but the young lady&#39;s 
eyes were off...no matter. Not many mainlanders had that particular hair 
color. She was most likely an Al Bhed. She seemed to be the more 
aggressive of the two, weaving through battle formations with a 
seamless, sharp power. She&#39;d be a good warrior soon enough, a fine 
Knight, Al Bhed or no. Her name meant dancer; Lucil pushed that 
information in the back of her head. It had to account for something, 
but she wouldn&#39;t pry. She knew better than anyone how deeply people held 
their secrets.

The other...Elma, was a bit different. Dark where Tyhlan was fair, and 
quieter, a bit more serious. Their closeness had, for a moment, led 
Lucil to believe that their relationship was a bit more personal than 
she first thought, but watching them now, Tyhlan whispering something 
while Elma cast nervous, uneasy smiles over her shoulder, made Lucil 
think differently. She had never been one for companionship herself, 
preferring instead to find her comfort in solitude, but the two girls 
moved with each other well, they complimented each other in a way that 
made Lucil a bit envious. She would have to put them together in 
training procedure from now on. They worked off one another, one would 
start a conversation, and the other would move into it seamlessly, until 
they were either both laughing or smiling. Elma was different, something 
unusual in the ranks. Young, for a Knight. The shorter haircut framed 
her face well, and she was a good fighter, an excellent student. Her 
eyes were bright, but solemn, at times, serious. She recalled the sphere 
the girl had sent her with warmth. She was so uneasy, and innocent, 
and...

&quot;Are you alright, captain?&quot; Tyhlan&#39;s voice broke her reverie. Both of 
the young women stared at her, Tyhlan curiously, Elma worriedly. She 
nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m quite alright, cadet,&quot; she murmured. &quot;No need to worry. Carry on.&quot;

Tyhlan seemed satisfied with that, but Elma still glanced over her 
shoulder from time to time. The girl was so intent on checking on Lucil, 
that she tripped over her feet. Lucil moved, ready to grab her, but 
Tyhlan was already there, gripping her arm tightly, and helping her back 
up.

&quot;Geez, watch where you&#39;re going, Elma!&quot; the blonde joked good-naturedly, 
grinning brightly and shaking her head. Elma flushed and glanced down, 
mumbling under her breath. Lucil frowned, noticing her hand was still 
caught grasping in mid-air, and dropped it quickly, hoping neither girl 
noticed. They reached the mage without any trouble, and Elma performed 
the prayer, but Tyhlan only turned her head away. Elma whispered 
something in a low hiss to the other girl, but she did not budge. Her 
eyes were cold, and dark with anger. Lucil took this all in, and did not 
ask any questions. She performed the prayer to Elma, even as her sore 
arms protested, and saluted Tyhlan. The girl&#39;s eyes flickered curiously, 
but she gave Lucil a watery grin and returned the salute.

They were good girls, Lucil thought. She was lucky to have them both in 
her squad. Before she entered the tent, she noted the way Tyhlan&#39;s 
posture slowly relaxed, saw Elma murmur comforting words, and smiled, 
weakly. They were good for each other too. She hoped Yevon would be with 
them both, for as long as they traversed the realm of the living.

-------------------

A/N: I&#39;d like to give thanks to the absolutely beautiful song, Valse De 
La Lune, from Wolf&#39;s Rain for helping me finish this chapter. I thought 
I had hit a wall. God bless Yoko Kanno. We&#39;ll be back to Elma and her 
worrying next chapter. Elma&#39;s so cute. Lucil returns! Lucil&#39;s my 
favorite; I enjoy writing her lines. Chapters come easier with her 
around. She should have been gone longer, but this IS an Elma/Lucil fic. 
=P

Catch the reference to a previous Final Fantasy in this chapter, and you 
get a chocobo plushie. On a humorous note, a friend of mine noted that 
Elma has a &#39;slight Southern accent&#39; in the American version of X, and I 
immediately got a mental image of Elma and Lucil fighting those &quot;damn 
Yankees&quot; in the Civil War. I&#39;m weird, I know.</pre>
