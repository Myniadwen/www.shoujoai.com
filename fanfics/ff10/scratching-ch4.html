<h1>Scratching the Surface (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff10/index.html">Final Fantasy 10</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupiterchan.html">JupiterChan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff10/scratching-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>In dedication to Si-kun, without him I don&#39;t think I would have 
finished the third chapter. You are truly my biggest fan, thank you so 
much for all of the ego boosting that you have done! 

 
&quot;You can not do this, you have no right to dismiss Rikku from her 
guardianship!&quot; Screamed Lulu as she slammed her hands against a metal 
panel, sighing heavily Yuna kept her blue and green eyes focused onto 
the dark sorceress&#39;s red hues.

&quot;Do you think that I want this either? Of course not, but I cannot 
defy my uncle&#39;s request in dismissing Rikku. I have no choice in the 
matter, Lulu I am sorry but this is the way it has to be.&quot; Breathed 
the young summoner as she brushed a lock of bead adorned hair from her 
cheek, gritting her teeth the fair skinned mage slammed her fist 
against the same metal paneling as she did before, tears streaked down 
her ivory coloured face as her chest began to heave up and down with a 
heavy sob.

&quot;If, if you release Rikku, then I will resign from my status as 
guardian as well. Don&#39;t push me to do that Yuna.&quot; Lulu spat with venom 
in her tone causing the young brunette to blink back a shocked look, 
both from the sudden lack of formality and the sincerely rage that was 
lashing out with each syllable she spoke. Calming folding her arms 
over her small chest Yuna closed her eyes and clinched her jaw muscle 
before she tried to give voice to her thoughts.

&quot;Lulu, you know very good and well that you cannot just resign. You 
know the only way to be able to relieve yourself from your duties is 
if I were to release you or one of the two of us die. I know you love 
Rikku, but so do I, and that is my reasoning for letting her go. There 
is no use putting her endanger, you should be happy that she will be 
safe here with her family and friends, Lulu just let her go. I promise 
that the two of you will be together again, as soon as we defeat Sin. 
&quot; Murmured Yuna as she slowly opened her eyes and concentrated on the 
ebony haired witch&#39;s face, with an almost snarl Lulu pulled back a 
sore hand and swung towards the aeon summoner just barely missing her 
face.

&quot;You can&#39;t do this! You just can&#39;t!&quot; Sobbed the mistress of the black 
arts as her fragile looking frame slid to the floor shaking violently, 
bending down Yuna gently took the older woman in her arms and held her 
comfortingly.

&quot;I am so sorry, but I just can&#39;t help it. Cid wishes for Rikku to stay 
here, it is out of my hands now, but perhaps you could persuade him to 
change his mind in the matter.&quot; Whispered the young summoner as she 
forced a warm smile and stood up then exited the room before Lulu 
could even reclaim her voice.

The day dragged on painfully slow for the black mage as she 
contemplated discussing her feelings towards Rikku with Cid, though in 
her mind the act seemed futile and useless. The soft mattress under 
her slender body squeaked slightly as she turned to lay on her 
stomach, Lulu didn&#39;t want to see Rikku in her condition nor did she 
wish to come out of her room, all the ebony haired guardian wanted at 
the moment was to sulk in privacy. Lazily shutting her wine red eyes 
Lulu could feel sleep slowly creeping up on her conscience mind, 
momentarily burying all of the raw emotions that were filling her 
whole being. 

&quot;Lulu, are you awake?&quot; Squeaked a shaking sounding voice as the mage&#39;s 
bedroom door snapped open with an automated click.

&quot;Against better judgment, yes I am. What is it Rikku?&quot; Lulu murmured 
with a hazy scratching noise to her deep tone, not even bothering to 
turn around from her position on the large overstuff mattress the 
older woman folded her arms in front of her and gently placed her head 
onto the makeshift pillow she had created. With soft steps the young 
Al-Bhed padded over to the large bed and claimed the edge as a seat 
before she crawled over to Lulu on her hands and knees.

&quot;I have something to tell you.&quot; Stated Rikku in a low skittish tone 
that seemed to be masking something of great importance, with a 
furrowed brow the ebony haired witch slowly began to turn to face her 
young lover but was stopped as the blonde thief straddled her backside 
and tenderly lowered her own body on top of that of Lulu&#39;s. 

&quot;Rikku, are you alright? Something seems off, is anything the matter?&quot; 
Inquired the dark haired sorceress as she felt the young blonde shiver 
against her back and tenderly wrap her thin arms around her sides in 
an awkward embrace, laying her pale cheek against the older woman&#39;s 
shoulder Rikku nuzzled her body closer to the ebony haired mage.

&quot;Lulu,&quot; Breathed the Al-Bhed in a meek tone that was laced with traces 
of anxiety and pure panic. &quot;I told Cid, about us. H-h-h-he took 
it&#133;r-r-r-rather well, I think.&quot; Rikku stuttered as she clung onto the 
older guardian for dear life, with a raised brow Lulu cranked her head 
around towards the short thief; her red orbs widened as the fact 
suddenly hit her head on.

&quot;You did what,&quot; Choked out the pale witch as Rikku loosened her grip 
and slid onto the bed shaking as if frozen to the very marrow of her 
bones. &quot;Rikku, sweetie, what in Spira possessed you to tell your 
father about us?&quot; Blathered Lulu as she placed a quaking hand on her 
ivory coloured cheek blinking off the shear shock of what the young 
blonde just told her. Rolling onto her back Rikku looked up at the 
ceiling raising her hand into the air as she stared at her thin digits 
twitching involuntarily, taking a deep breath Lulu gathered her 
thoughts as she reached out and took hold of the young Al-Bhed&#39;s 
outstretched hand and intertwined their fingers.

&quot;Lulu, I didn&#39;t mean to tell him! Honest I didn&#39;t! It&#39;s just, we were 
talking and he said that I could tell him anything and he wouldn&#39;t get 
upset&#133;and I got caught up in the moments and I told him about us! He 
took the news really wonderfully&#133;well&#133;after he um&#133;regained conciseness 
that is.&quot; Murmured the younger woman with a barely visible smile that 
lightened the whole mood of the room, gently brushing a loose tress of 
sandy blonde hair behind Rikku&#39;s dainty ear the ebony manned sorceress 
forced a small smirk of her own.

&quot;Please tell me you are just joking.&quot; Declared Lulu in a soft voice as 
she felt the young Al-Bhed gently squeezed the hand she had used to 
straighten her disorderly hair, lightly snuzzling the palm of the 
mage&#39;s hand Rikku coyly moved closer to the older woman until her nose 
lightly rubbed against that of Lulu&#39;s. 

&quot;No, I&#39;m being serious, Cid fainted when I told him&#133;I guess I should 
have been more discrete when I told him. Err, then again I did just 
blurt out &#39;Dad I&#39;m a lesbian&#39;&#133;anything would have been more discrete, 
huh?&quot; Rhetorically inquired the short blonde thief as the pale mage 
wrapped her frail arms around her and brought her into a tight 
embrace. 

&quot;Cid fainting? Yes I do believe that comment would practically make 
any grown man pass out from shock.&quot; Smirked Lulu as she stared into 
Rikku&#39;s clear blue orbs relishing the sight in itself, with a smile of 
her own the younger guardian almost hesitantly leaned in and gently 
pressed her lips against the ebony haired woman&#39;s lightly purple 
coloured mouth giving her a small kiss before she pulled back 
slightly.

&quot;Lulu, umm&#133;there&#133;is something else I need to tell you.&quot; Whispered 
Rikku in a shallow tone as she traced the curves of the older woman 
face with her fingertips, narrowing her wine red hues the mistress of 
the dark arts looked at the blonde Al-Bhed as a wave of un-subdued 
seriousness took over her features. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Lulu inquired with a wavering frown as she felt her 
lover teasingly trail her hands down her neck and just above her 
cleavage line, playfully Rikku stuck out the tip of her tongue and bit 
it lightly in a manner that Lulu knew very well. 

&quot;It&#39;s good news, very good news.&quot; Giggled the blonde girl as her 
cheeks slowly began to flush a pale shade of pink causing Lulu to 
raise a slender eyebrow questioningly. 

&quot;So, tell me then, I could uses some good news.&quot; Chided the mage in a 
low tone as she slowly reached out and stroked small soothing circles 
against the younger woman&#39;s reddening cheeks with her thumb, with an 
innocent smile Rikku gently pushed against Lulu&#39;s hand as she let a 
soft throaty purr escape her barely parted lips.

&quot;I don&#39;t have to give up my guardianship. I can stay here with you!&quot; 
Squealed the blonde teenager as she lunged forward and tightly hugged 
the ebony haired woman. 

&quot;&#133;You don&#39;t?!&quot; Exclaimed Lulu in a high-pitched voice that slightly 
startled Rikku, both from being so amazingly girlish and from the 
loudness of being so close. 

&quot;Nope, I talked my dad into letting me stay on the team!&quot; Gleefully 
announced the small-built Al-Bhed girl as she began to plant kisses 
all over the black mage&#39;s face and neck, skillfully Rikku placed a 
guiding hand onto Lulu&#39;s bare shoulder rolling her onto her back. 
Grinning wolfishly the young Al-Bhed sat up on her hands and knees so 
her lithe frame hovered above that of Lulu&#39;s, playfully biting her 
tongue again Rikku straddled the ebony manned witch&#39;s hips as she 
slowly leaned over the older woman and smiled sweetly. 

&quot;And I suppose the little &#39;I am so scared and sad&#39; act earlier was 
just for shear shock value?&quot; Mumbled Lulu as she reached up and 
loosened a buckle on Rikku&#39;s outfit, with a nod the Al-Bhed beamed a 
wide grin.

&quot;Yah-huh, I could barely keep from laughing the whole time. But 
luckily I am a wonderful actress.&quot; Mused Rikku in a giddy voice as 
another buckle was undone without her notice.

&quot;I will store that little bit of information away for future use,&quot; 
Chuckled the dark haired mistress of the black arts as she slid open 
the leather like shirt her girlfriend wore revealing her collarbone 
and soft pale flesh.    

&quot;And what do you think you are doing?&quot; Inquired Rikku as she stared at 
Lulu with raised eyebrows watching her unclasp a third buckle, coyly 
smiling the mage lifted her vision from the younger girl&#39;s chest to 
her face.

&quot;Well, I was trying to seduce you, but apparently I failed.&quot; Retorted 
Lulu in a low tone as she began to tap Rikku&#39;s goggles with a slightly 
vexed expression on her pale face, frowning lightly the young Al-Bhed 
slowly pressed her body against lulu&#39;s slender form. 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that, and anyhow, you can&#39;t seduce someone that is 
willing.&quot; Replied Rikku as she slowly began to lap at the base of 
Lulu&#39;s neck causing the ebony haired mage to let out a soft moan, 
arching her back slightly Lulu wrapped her legs around that of the 
younger woman&#39;s waist locking her feet together securing the fair 
blonde on top of her.  

&quot;Hmm, you are so very licentious, do you know that?&quot; Cooed Lulu as she 
ran her fingers through the younger girl&#39;s blonde tresses while 
savouring the feel of Rikku&#39;s hot breath beating down on her flesh, 
giggling lightly the half clothed thief tenderly bit down onto the 
mage&#39;s gorgeously exposed neck again.

&quot;Stop with the big words, my poor brain can&#39;t take it,&quot; Chided Rikku 
as she groped along the edges of Lulu&#39;s silken black dress, causing 
agues of pleasure to gently take hold of the tall ebony haired witch. 
&quot;Anyhow, Lulu, I have something else to tell you.&quot; Whispered the 
blonde Al-Bhed as her face suddenly blanched and the intimacy in her 
pale hues lessened, pursing her lips Lulu examined Rikku&#39;s soft facial 
features finding it arduous to read clearly.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Gruffly inquired the mistress of the dark arts as her 
stomach knotted up tightly threatening to spill the contents she 
consumed earlier.

&quot;It&#39;s,&quot; Breathed the blonde girl as she all but quailed away from her 
lover&#39;s firm grip. &quot;Cid, he wants to&#133;talk&#133;to you about&#133;us. I know 
there isn&#39;t anything to worry about, it is just that&#133;you see, there 
are some&#133;Al-Bhed customs&#133;that&#133;sort of frighten me.&quot; Rikku hoarsely 
stated as her throat caught on an unshed sob, gently reaching out with 
a comforting hand Lulu slowly stroked calming circles into the small 
of the young thief&#39;s back; the tension giving way under her long 
slender digits.

&quot;I am sure, whatever the customs are, we can handle it. After all, 
what is a simple Al-Bhed dating ritual in comparison to fighting Sin? 
See, it is relatively minuscule.&quot; Lulu muttered in a consoling tone 
that caused Rikku to feverishly nuzzle the crook of her neck as a sign 
of thanks.

&quot;You always know what to say,&quot; Chimed the blonde as she sat up and 
gazed down at the black haired beauty underneath her slim frame, a 
small trace of anxiety still remaining in her cool blue orbs. &quot;But, 
sweetie, er&#133;the thing is, Sin and my family are two totally different 
things. You really can&#39;t compare them. Lulu, the thing is&#133;you have to 
be judged by my family. Yunnie, dad, even brother, they all have to 
make sure you are&#133;the right one for me.&quot; Meekly stated Rikku as her 
heart started to beat in her chest, she could see the way Lulu&#39;s red 
eyes had widened at the old fashion ways of the Al-Bheds courting 
traditions. 

&quot;Well,&quot; Lulu allowed herself to swallow rather hard before she went 
on. &quot;I think I can handle that easily. After all we both know that 
lady Yuna is completely in favour of our relationship.&quot; Stated the 
ebony haired witch in a low tone as she looked into Rikku&#39;s eyes 
scanning for any further hidden information. 

&quot;Neutral, Yunnie is more neutral than anything else,&quot; The young 
Al-Bhed corrected as looked deeply into Lulu&#39;s crimson hues with a 
soft frown etched on her childlike face. &quot;But don&#39;t worry about it, 
you will do fine, just be yourself and everything will go fine, I 
promise.&quot; Whispered the blonde guardian in a serious tone that caused 
Lulu to flinch. 

&quot;I know, and besides, you are the one that seems to be worrying. Just 
calm down a bit.&quot; Murmured Lulu as she sat up bringing the smaller 
girl into a tight embrace. Nodding slightly the blonde thief hugged 
her lover more before she released her and quickly pounced to her feet 
so that she stood up on the bed; causing the black manned mistress of 
the dark arts to sigh lightly at the juvenal antics her girlfriend 
displayed. 

&quot;I am calm! Er, well, I am not worried that is for sure. I am just so 
anxious I can barely wait! Then again, dad wants to have the Judging 
Ceremony tonight at dinner.&quot; Squealed Rikku as she began to jump up 
and down on the soft mattress with glee. Grunting slightly Lulu rose 
up from her sitting position on the bed and stood on the metal floor 
causing her heels to clink on its hard surface, stifling a large yawn 
with the back of her hand the black mage slowly strolled towards the 
automated door. 

&quot;Rikku I am going to go take a shower, promise me you won&#39;t break my 
bed before I get back.&quot; Coolly declared Lulu as she looked over her 
shoulder giving the short blonde girl a sultry wink, giggling lightly 
the young Al-Bhed smiled and leapt from the overstuffed mattress 
landing with a loud thud. 

&quot;M-m-m-maybe I s-s-should j-j-join you? So, I will keep out of 
trouble.&quot; Lamely inquired Rikku as she kicked at the flood meekly, 
pursing her purple coloured lips the ebony manned witch gave the 
younger girl a look of deep thought before she bit her bottom lip as 
her mind filled with a plethora of dirty thoughts. 

&quot;How long do we have before dinner anyhow?&quot; Lulu asked as she smirked 
wickedly at the younger guardian, tapping her forehead Rikku shrugged.

&quot;Three hours, maybe less, it all depends on if they are making 
something fancy or just some quick meal. But seeing as how there is 
gonna be a ceremony tonight I am guessing something really elegant and 
time consuming. Why?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, I was just wondering if we will have time to&#133;er&#133;spare.&quot; Smirked 
Lulu as she continued to stroll off towards the exit swaggering her 
hips seductively as she went, slag-jawed and slightly blushing her 
young lover followed her lead; with every step her cheeks turned a 
darker hue of red. 

&quot;So you think this is the way to go about handling the situation with 
those two?&quot; Inquired a soft voice that belonged to the young Summoner, 
nodding lightly Cid crossed his arms over his broad chest giving Yuna 
a look of pure determination. 

&quot;Yuna, you should know those two better than anyone, and you still 
seem uneasy about the whole idea of them being together. Ya know, that 
leaves me feeling pretty unsure, so I have to see for myself if this 
Lulu person is right for my little girl.&quot; Commented the bald Al-Bhed 
pilot as his gaze shifted from his niece to the far wall of the room. 

&quot;It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t feel they aren&#39;t right for each other, it is 
just that I am&#133;uncomfortable with them seeing each other. I&#39;ve know 
Lulu all of my life, and Rikku a good majority of the time as well, 
but to see them together is odd for me. It is like&#133;for me at 
least&#133;almost incest in a way. I see Lulu as my older sister, and Rikku 
is my cousin after all&#133;I know I am just being selfish and 
closed-minded but, I can&#39;t get over it for some reason.&quot; Murmured Yuna 
as she ran a shaking hand over her cheek in effort to calm herself but 
only succeeded in realizing how nervous she was, warding off the young 
Summoner&#39;s awkward demeanor Cid turned to face the large control 
sphere in the center of the cockpit.

&quot;Your jealous.&quot; Stated the owner of the Highwind as he spun around on 
his heels facing the daughter of lord Braska causing her blue and 
green orbs to harden with guile.

&quot;Maybe, maybe I am, I know I should be happy for them. But, why can&#39;t 
I be loved without the feeling of it being a burden to my duties as a 
Summoner? I have the right to be in love too! It just isn&#39;t fair!&quot; 
Shouted Yuna as she looked at her uncle with pain glinting deeply in 
her eyes.

&quot;I understand sweetie, I really do. But life isn&#39;t fair, and we all 
have to deal with that. Just, just enjoy the time you have with him; I 
know that is what Tidus wants you to do. Screw em&#39; all and write your 
story the way you want it to be not the way everyone else wants it! 
It&#39;s your life&#133;live it.&quot; Grumbled the older man as he gave the young 
aeon summoner a weak smile, bowing her head Yuna sighed.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Uttered the daughter of High Summoner Braska as she cast 
her line of vision upward just as the sudden sound of Lulu murmuring a 
hushed conversation to her lover echoed up from the hallway outside of 
the cockpit. 

&quot;Well, there they are, we had better go out and tell them dinner is 
ready, eh?&quot; Rhetorically inquired Cid as he walked over to the 
automatic door and stepped out surprising both Rikku and Lulu. 

&quot;Ugh dad, don&#39;t sneak up on people!&quot; Yelped the petite blonde as she 
brushed a damp braid away from her face with an expression of 
embarrassment set on her facial features. Smirking broadly the bald 
Al-Bhed rubbed the back of his head semi-apologetically.

&quot;Just the two girls I needed to see,&quot; Mused Cid as he dropped his 
voice to sound a bit more serious. &quot;Dinner should be done in a few 
minutes so I think we all should head towards the dinning hall before 
supper gets cold eh?&quot; Stated the Bald Al-Bhed as he slowly motioned 
towards the direction that the galley was in, Rikku smiled broadly as 
she wrapped her arms around Lulu&#39;s waist not caring if it made anyone 
uncomfortable.

&quot;Sounds great to me!&quot; Squealed the blonde thief with a shiver of glee 
running up and down her spine, her excitement didn&#39;t go unnoticed by 
the ebony haired mage who lightly cuddled her thin frame against that 
of the younger girl&#39;s. 

&quot;Then shall we venture off?&quot; Inquired Lulu in a low tone as she slowly 
guided the young bouncy girl beside her towards the dinning hall, 
nuzzling the ebony manned woman&#39;s arm the young Al-Bhed half dragged 
the older woman with her as she finally decided to move towards the 
galley; leaving Cid in the hallway chuckling.

&quot;Hurry up Lulu,&quot; Whined Rikku as she rushed inside of a large room and 
hopped up and down trying to lure the pale mage into the area faster.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so impatient Rikku, they will wait a few more moments if 
need be. I don&#39;t have to break a sweat just trying to get to dinner 
ahead of everyone.&quot; Lulu calmly proclaimed as she strolled down the 
hallway at a leisurely pace, folding her petite arms over her small 
chest the blonde Al-Bhed pouted silently before she turned her back on 
the black mage and stared at the long table with plates and other 
eatery ware laid out on it.   

&quot;Whoa&#133;just look at this place, I haven&#39;t seen it like this in years. 
In fact the last time I saw it looking like this was when someone got 
married.&quot; Breathed Rikku in a shallow voice as her face began to 
redden at the thought of the Al-Bheds going to such lengths just for 
her and Lulu&#39;s Judging Ceremony. 

&quot;What was that, Rikku?&quot; Lulu asked as she wrapped her arms around the 
thin thief&#39;s waist from behind bring her body against the older 
woman&#39;s silken dress clad frame, purring lightly the blonde haired 
Al-Bhed slowly turned around with a soft smile etched on her pretty 
face.

&quot;Can they not keep their hands off each other for longer than five 
minutes?&quot; Gruffly chortled Cid as he stepped into the galley, his 
hardened gaze piercing into the two female guardians as he stared at 
them half loathing the fact his child was now a woman in love and the 
other half of him still in shock that his daughter was a woman in love 
with another woman. Stepping up behind the bald Al-Bhed giggling Yuna 
shook her head.

&quot;Thus far their record is about four and three fourth minutes without 
any physical contact whatsoever.&quot; Stated the young aeon summoner with 
a light smile on her face, taken a step closer to the two lovers Cid 
cleared his throat to gather their attention.

&quot;Well, well, well, if we all are ready to get started.&quot; Declared the 
pilot of the Highwind as he clasped his meaty hands together causing a 
loud smack to echo through out the room, looking up at the older man 
Lulu loosened her grip on Rikku but suddenly found herself being 
latched onto as if the floor were going to give way and she was the 
only stable object in arms reach. Turning her head slowly in the 
direction into which the younger girl was staring the black haired 
witch suddenly saw why her girlfriend seemed so scared, standing in 
the doorway of the dinning hall stood Brother with a look of pure 
disgust upon his face. 

&quot;Humph, cecdan E druikrd dryd oui fuimt ryja paddan dycda dryh du tyda 
cusa cmid uv y syka. Oui naymmo tecybbuehd sa. Ur famm yd maycd fa kad 
du ayd famm duhekrd.&quot; Brother stated as he lazily walked into the 
galley shrugging off the looks that everyone gave him, narrowing her 
red eyes at the Mohawk haired Al-Bhed Lulu protectively held the 
younger girl that clung to her tightly, the silken rolls of her dress 
slowly became damp as Rikku buried her face in a loose fold of the 
fabric letting the material dry her cool blue eyes as tears trickled 
down her cheeks. 

&quot;Seht ouin duhkia, puo. E ryja aync yht E lyh ihtancdyht ajano funt 
oui cyo. Tu hud ehjuga sa, ed fuimt pa nydran ayco yd drec susahd eh 
desa.&quot; Gruffly snapped Lulu in a overbearing tone as a thin hand shot 
out in front of her with a single long digit pointing warningly at the 
young male Al-Bhed that stood before her, an expression of shock 
flashed on Brother&#39;s face before he forced a harsh glare at the black 
mage. 

&quot;Mecdah fusyh, oui tuh&#39;d nyeca ouin juela du sa! E ys ypuja oui eh

Mohawk haired Al-Bhed as he slowly pulled out a seat and flopped down 
into it, raising her fist so that they were level with her cheekbones 
Rikku stood on her tiptoes as rage threatened to knock her off 
balance; the only thing keeping her from falling flat on her face as a 
gentle hand placed on her left shoulder. 

&quot;How dare you say that to Lulu, you don&#39;t even know her! She isn&#39;t a 
whore and she is anything but stupid, she is the most articulate and 
eloquent woman in all of Spira! You don&#39;t have any right to call her 
those names you bastard, of all people you, you, dare call the person 
I love such horrible things! I should kick your worthless ass, ya know 
that! But, but I won&#39;t, ya know why? Because I wouldn&#39;t be able to 
stop if I started, not after what you did to me! Not after all these 
years, I forced myself to forget it, I let the whole thing feaster 
into a pulsating rage and if I start to settle things now, I would end 
up killing you!&quot; Screamed the short blonde Al-Bhed as she began to 
shake violently with tears rushing down her pale face, helplessly 
Brother blinked causing his knit brow to soften enough for everyone to 
see beads of sweat running across the wrinkled crease of his forehead. 

&quot;What are you two talking about?&quot; Barked Cid as his hardened eyes 
narrowed into small slits and a vain on his temple began to visibly 
throb as anger rose up his whole body causing his voice to lower an 
octave. Spinning to face her father Rikku clutched her fist together 
wearing an expression of complete malice, her cool whirlpool like eyes 
blazing with both guilt and rage. 

&quot;It&#39;s business between Brother and myself dad, you don&#39;t need to worry 
about it, okay?&quot; The blonde Al-Bhed declared in a meek trembling voice 
that caused the younger of the two males in the room to shiver ever so 
slightly. 

&quot;Um, okay then. Whatever you say Rikku. I&#39;ll let you handle it.&quot; 
Murmured Cid in a deep tone as he pulled out a chair for Yuna then 
seated himself, letting out a swallow sigh the energetic thief brushed 
her unruly bangs from her face in order to calm her rattled nerves. 

Leaning in closely to the young Al-Bhed Lulu placed a gentle kiss 
right below the blonde guardian&#39;s earlobe that was meant to calm her 
down rather than to excite her. Tenderly squeezing Rikku&#39;s right 
shoulder the ebony haired mage ushered the thin girl to a chair at the 
end of the long dinning table, silently Lulu pulled out a cushioned 
chair and without any need for words Rikku took the offered seat. 

In the back of Cid&#39;s mind he noted how his daughter and the older 
woman seemed to act as one at times, how their body movements flowed 
like the finest of silk or how they both seemed to act in manners 
complementary of each other, with a small smile the bald pilot of the 
Highwind nodded approvingly. 

&quot;So,&quot; Calmly began Lulu as she seated herself and sought out the 
younger girl&#39;s hand and reassuringly held it with her own. &quot;Things 
seem to be a bit on the tense side this evening, perhaps it would be 
better if we were to retire for the night and do this some other time, 
when things are less disagreeable.&quot; Muttered the fair skinned witch 
with a stoic expression adorning her pale face, coughing into the palm 
of his hand Cid cleared his throat as if the gesture itself signaled 
for the discussion to be closed immediately. 

&quot;That is impossible,&quot; Grimly stated the aged Al-Bhed as he ran a 
quaking hand over the top of the table smoothening out the nonexistent 
crease in the fabric. &quot;You see Lulu, this is a one shot ordeal, and 
there&#39;s no rescheduling or second chances. That is why this is a 
milestone event with the Al-Bheds, if the&#133;partner&#133;isn&#39;t completely fit 
to be with the family member then that person is forbidden to see that 
family member ever again.&quot; 

&quot;Wha&#133;&quot; Gasped Lulu as the ability to form complete sentences abruptly 
eluded her, tapping a long slender index finger against the middle of 
her forehead the black mage gathered her thoughts before she tried to 
speak again. &quot;Um, so you are saying that, if I don&#39;t &#39;pass&#39; tonight 
then&#133;.&quot;

&quot;You never get to see me again.&quot; Lamely stated Rikku as her gaze 
pieced the long dinning table as she bowed her head and refused to 
look up, sighing deeply the ebony manned sorceress lifted a steady 
hand to her girlfriend&#39;s face and gently tucked one knuckle under her 
chin and tilted the blonde Al-Bhed&#39;s vision upward until their eyes 
locked.

&quot;Well then, I guess I have nothing to worry about. Because we are 
perfect for one another.&quot; Warming whispered Lulu in a hushed voice as 
she rubbed the younger girl&#39;s jaw with her thumb, nuzzling into the 
movement Rikku smiled a lopsided grin and suddenly felt reassured. 

&quot;Ugh! Oui dfu syga sa celg! E&#39;s mayjehk.&quot; Stated Brother as he mock 
gagged and pushed away from the table letting his chair fall over 
behind him adding to the outraged effect he was trying to establish. 
As the Mohawk haired Al-Bhed stamped around the table towards the exit 
he paused for a moment, his shoulders tightening up and his fist 
clutching at his side. With a cocky demeanor Brother leaned over Rikku 
placing a large hand on her petite arm and whispered in her ear, as he 
pulled away a large smile spread across his face as his eyes twinkled 
dangerously. 

&quot;E ihtancdyht,&quot; Choked out the small blonde guardian as if she had 
just watched someone drown in the Moonflow. A sudden anger flared up 
in Lulu&#39;s wine red hues as she outstretched her right hand to smite 
the man beside her lover, a feather light touch abruptly stopped the 
ebony haired mage before she had the chance to even think of a spell 
to summon. &quot;Please don&#39;t Lulu, not here.&quot; 

Nodding lightly the mistress of the dark arts let her hand fall to her 
side as anger swelled to the surface of her emotion pool, taking a 
deep breath the tall black mage ripped her gaze way from the Mohawk 
haired Al-Bhed as he moved away from the youngest of the Al-Bheds in 
the room and slowly strolled out of the galley. 

&quot;I don&#39;t understand what the hell is wrong with you two, but whatever 
it is you and your brother had better settle things up soon or I swear 
I will kick both of you off of my ship!&quot; Roughly bellowed the pilot of 
the Highwind as he rubbed the sides of his pounding head. 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Blankly retorted Rikku as three male Al-Bheds pushed large 
trays of streaming food towards the long dinning table, skillfully 
each man placed the shimmering plates in front of each of the people 
that were seated. Leaning back in his chair Cid let his eyes fall over 
the tall ebony haired mage again, seizing her up, a look of slight 
confusion and irritability etched its way across his face as he tied 
in vain to piece together what was going on between his children. 
Snubbing the side of his nose the bald Al-Bhed closed his tired orbs 
then slowly batted them open again sighing heavily as he did so.

&quot;Anyhow,&quot; Coyly droned Cid in a flat tone as his hands lifted a tray 
top that was placed in front of him that was golden in colour. &quot;Seeing 
as how Brother isn&#39;t here to give his verdict, I, being the head of 
the house, hereby void his opinion in this Judging Ceremony. So, lets 
all continue on with the feast.&quot; Mirthfully announced the bald man as 
he pushed the open gold tray towards Rikku, a sudden high-pitched 
squeal echoed throughout the room as the young blonde thief shot up 
from her chair and clumsily grasped a water pitcher that sat in the 
center of the golden plate. 

&quot;Daddy you&#39;re the best!&quot; Squeaked the thin blonde Al-Bhed as her lithe 
frame glided around the long table, with an impish grin Rikku poured 
Cid a glass of water, then Yuna, and lastly Lulu before she slid back 
into her seat and all but bounced up and down in the cushioned chair. 
With a raised brow the mistress of the dark arts took hold of the 
water pitcher and silently filled her girlfriend&#39;s glass, the crystal 
coloured liquid swirled in a downward column along the inner china 
works until the cup was filled just below the brim. 

Shifting her red eyes forward Lulu took note how Cid seemed pleased 
with her resent action, slowly reaching over the ebony haired witch 
reclaimed Rikku&#39;s small hand and tenderly entwined their fingers 
together. 

&quot;Lets eat.&quot; Bluntly ordered the bald pilot with a hint of humour to 
his voice, with out any further instruction the sandy manned thief 
lifted a handle to a silver tray lightly pulling the metal covering 
off of the Al-Bhed delicacies. 

&quot;Is this&#133;what I think it is?&quot; Groaned Rikku as her face twisted into a 
half shocked look, the expression she wore for a moment was unreadable 
to Lulu but quickly the black mage recognized it as detest.

&quot;Yes Rikku, it&#39;s your favourite, saut&eacute;ed chocobo marinated in pur&eacute;ed 
cactuar juices.&quot; Smugly grinned Cid in a sardonic tone as the younger 
of the two Al-Bheds made an audible &#39;ugh&#39; noise and scooted her plate 
forward. 

&quot;Aw man, dad you know how much I hate this type of food, and think of 
the poor chocobos and cactuars that were killed to make this stuff. 
Ew!&quot; Groaned the blonde Al-Bhed in an almost nasally voice as she 
stuck out her tongue and lightly bit the tip of it, signaling her 
complete dislike in the matter. 

&quot;Oh c&#39;mon Rikku, it isn&#39;t all that bad.&quot; Chimed Lady Yuna in a 
slightly humorous voice, one that seemed to cause the lithe framed 
thief to giggle as if the two just shared an inside joke. 

&quot;Your one to talk Yunnie, which one of us has a phobia of snow peas?&quot; 
Teasingly mused the sandy manned blonde as she grinned wolfishly at 
her cousin, laughing into the palm of her hand the young aeon summoner 
waggled in a mock warningly fashion. 

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t, you aren&#39;t going to bring that up, and if you do, I 
will fully blame your girlfriend for it.&quot; Mirthfully announced Yuna in 
a feather-light tone, upon hearing her name mentioned the ebony haired 
mage looked up with a blank expression adorning her ivory pale face.

&quot;What now?&quot; Inquired Lulu with a raised brow and a hint of confusion 
laced gently in her voice, with a wrinkled nose Rikku turned to her 
lover, her cheeks reddened with laughter.

&quot;Yunnie,&quot; Whined the youngest of the guardians as she reached over and 
cuddled against her lover at an awkward angle. &quot;You can&#39;t blame her, 
you were the one that didn&#39;t eat your dinner, can she help it that she 
was trying to be the disciplinarian?&quot;

Before the young summoner could respond with a definite &#39;yes&#39; to the 
question she had just been asked, the black haired witch tapped her 
chin with a long slender index finger as she searched her mind for 
what the two teenagers were talking about, shaking her head Lulu 
suddenly laughed out loud as she realized what the two were 
reminiscing over. 

&quot;You have to be kidding me, you still remember that time I forced you 
to finish all of your vegetables.&quot; Chortled the older woman as she 
leaned back in her chair with a half smile on her face, placing both 
hands on the table the daughter of Braska made a face that seemed to 
melt away her mature composure.

&quot;Peas, they were snow peas,&quot; Snapped Yuna in a half serious tone as 
her differently coloured orbs narrowed on the black mage. &quot;They&#39;re 
crunchy, I hate that consistency in my mouth, and you made me eat 
every single piece on my plate, for over the course of a week, that 
was traumatizing.&quot; Pouted the young aeon summoner as she tucked a 
loose braid behind her ear and let out a quiet &#39;humph&#39;, rolling her 
red hues Lulu folded her arms over her abundant chest and smiled 
lightly.

&quot;Ya big baby!&quot; Mirthfully taunted Rikku causing her cousin to stick 
out her tongue and blow the blonde Al-Bhed a loud raspberry, shaking 
his head Cid raised his glass signaling for everyone to do the same.

&quot;Here is a toast to my sweet little Rikku, I hope that you and Lulu 
have many years of happiness together,&quot; Bellowed the bald Al-Bhed as 
everyone said &#39;cheers&#39; and took a sip of water. &quot;And the two of you,&quot; 
He turned his gaze on Yuna and Rikku. &quot;Had better eat everything on 
your plates or no banana pudding for either of you!&quot; Gruffly announced 
Cid in a semi-serious tone.

Upon hearing the words &#39;banana pudding&#39; Lulu all but spit out the 
small amount of liquid she was in the process of swallowing, clamping 
her hand around her mouth the ebony haired mage choked down the water 
as the thought of her young lover slowly spreading the thick sticky 
yellow dessert all over her nude form flashed in her mind causing the 
mistress of the black arts to flush a dark hue of red.     

&quot;Banana pudding you say.&quot; Wolfishly smirked the blonde Al-Bhed as she 
reached over and patted Lulu on the back trying to help the older 
woman free her airway, the gentle pounding of her hand slowly turned 
into a slight caressing causing the black manned witch to gradually 
regain her composure even though she knew Rikku was thinking the same 
thing she herself had thought only few moments ago. 

&quot;I don&#39;t even wanna know,&quot; Bellowed Cid as he fought the urge to 
imagine what in the name of Spira the two guardians had in mind with 
the yellow dessert, running a rough hand over the smoothness of his 
scalp the Highwind pilot took a long swallow from his cup before he 
mustered the nerve to speak again. &quot;Well, with all that said and done 
lets dig in.&quot; Cid declared as he clasped a fork from the table and 
feverishly began to devour the lump of food on his plate.

The dinner carried on slowly, every few minutes or so someone would 
try to strike up a light conversation but would slowly retreat back 
into consuming their meal after a simple one-word answer was giving in 
reply, with a gentle nudge of her fork Lulu stirred the thin paste 
around her plate in a small effort to seem as if she were actually 
trying to eat the delicacies placed before her. In the back of her 
mind the ebony haired mage knew she would later regret not forcing 
herself to at least try some of the food but for the red-eyed witch 
the simple act of eating was impossible, the cold knot growing at the 
pit of her stomach was beginning to lurch forward and twist violently 
causing her frail frame to tremble just enough for only one other 
person to notice. 

&quot;Lulu,&quot; Rikku asked in a low voice, her slender hand reaching out 
almost hesitantly beside her until it rest gently on the older woman&#39;s 
arm. &quot;Are you ugyo? Oui look sort of celg.&quot; Stammered the short thief 
as she slipped in and out of her native tongue, concern evident in 
both her voice and facial expression. Lightly almost playfully batting 
away the younger girl&#39;s hand Lulu smiled a weak unsteady grin and 
gently patted Rikku&#39;s knee under the table.

&quot;Yes, I am fine, no need to worry about me, although I am feeling a 
tad unsettled. Perhaps, and only if it is alright with your father, I 
may retire to my sleeping quarters?&quot; Lulu inquired in flat tone that 
in itself told Cid that she was indirectly talking to him, nodding 
lightly the bald Al-Bhed wiped his chin with a damask napkin and 
slightly swallowed what was left in his mouth.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, go on to bed, you look a bit green around the gills. 
Anyhow, we would have to ask you to leave in a few minutes anyway, the 
verdict is only given to the family member and the suitor is told to 
leave until that following morning when the head of the head of the 
house informs that person what the outcome is.&quot; Calmly stated Cid in a 
warm tone one that seemed to almost say &#39;welcome to the family&#39;; Lulu 
could feel the corners of her purple lips tug into a soft smile, 
standing from her chair the black manned mistress of the dark arts 
took a step away from the table but slowly ambulated back to where she 
had been sitting, with one quick movement Lulu bent down and lightly 
kissed the blonde Al-Bhed on the cheek and whispered into her petite 
ear.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Hoarsely breathed the older woman just before she felt 
thin arms encircle her waist and pull her so close it was hard to 
breath because of the sudden tightness around her ribs and abdomen.

&quot;I love you too Lulu!&quot; Yelped Rikku as she buried her face against the 
silken fabric of the black mage&#39;s dress, tears were already starting 
to spill from the young Al-Bhed girl&#39;s cool blue spiraling hues, with 
a gentle hand the taller of the two stroked a sandy tress of braided 
hair from the left side of Rikku&#39;s childlike face.

&quot;I&#39;m just going to bed, not dying. Bed, dying, dying, bed, see not the 
same thing, everything will be fine. I promise you.&quot; Wheezed Lulu in a 
half hallow voice that was low and sounded as if she were about to 
faint, the pain in her stomach suddenly throbbing against the added 
pressure of Rikku&#39;s firm hug. Sniffling lightly the blonde thief 
pulled away from her girlfriend and wiped the corners of her eyes with 
the back of her small gloved hand and nodded with a small smile, 
shaking her head lightly the ebony manned witch casually strolled from 
the galley until she heard the automated door seal behind her.

Clutching her midsection with both hands Lulu squeezed her eyes shut 
causing tears to run down her exceedingly white face, the anger and 
hatred that she had so recently bottled up and stored away was already 
rearing its ugly head. Never before had she felt so completely taken 
over by the emotion, at least not the point it hurt her physically. 
All the mistress of the black arts could hear was the beating of her 
own footsteps down the metal corridor and the erratic pounding of her 
heart in her ears as a searing pain shot to every nerve of her body, 
rounding the nearest corner the black mage all by threw herself into 
her poorly lit sleeping chamber. Gritting her teeth Lulu staggered 
over to her bed and fell onto the mattress face first, her nails 
digging small gashes into the soft fabric of the sheets beneath her 
prone form, the soft sound of her bedroom door opening didn&#39;t even 
registering in the ebony haired woman&#39;s ears as she fought the urge to 
scream until her anger subsided leaving feeling completely useless to 
protect her lover. 

&quot;Fruna,&quot; A sudden voice spat from the darkness with such harshness 
Lulu thought for a split second she was having a nightmare. &quot;Ruf lyh 
oui dyga ran yfyo vnus sa?! Cra fyc seha ihdem oui crufat ib, hu uha 
fyhdat ran aqlabd sa, E lmyesat ran! Oui ryja hu nekrd du zicd dyga so 
meddma cecdan vnus sa!&quot; Brother screamed as he launched his rigid body 
from his hiding place in the shadows and landed on the fair skinned 
woman&#39;s bed pinning her on her face down, his gloved fist slamming 
against the back of Lulu&#39;s head causing the ebony haired mage to let 
out a howl of pain. Laughing bitterly the young male Al-Bhed wrapped 
his large hands around the older woman&#39;s neck cutting off her airway 
instantly, feebly Lulu reached out behind her with a violently shaking 
hand as unconsciousness quickly tried to claim her, her long nails 
ripping and clawing at her attacker&#39;s eyes. Brother boomed with an 
almost insane cackle at the helpless mage&#39;s attempt to rid herself of 
him, tightening his grip around the black haired witch&#39;s neck the 
manic Al-Bhed snarled as he leaned in close to Lulu forcing all of his 
body weight against her hoping it would aid in smothering her. A 
twisted smile inched its way across Brother&#39;s face as he felt the 
guardian beneath him twitch violently then suddenly to limp, the 
sudden bolt of lightening that smashed against his chest took him off 
guard knocking from the prone mage&#39;s weakened frame. Staggering 
quickly to her feet Lulu out stretched her hands and screamed even 
though no words could come out, the fear that glinted in the young 
Al-Bhed&#39;s dark hues was enough to cause her to give him a wicked grin 
of her own. Lightening danced circles around Brother&#39;s body as he 
scurried to his feet to keep from being hit by the white-hot bolts, in 
a low voice Lulu bellowed out just above a whisper.

&quot;Now you know how she felt,&quot; Muttered the ebony haired mage as her 
body slumped forward as wave after wave of pain hit her full force as 
her body pulsated with raw emotion and power. &quot;Rage.&quot; Lulu stated as 
the room lit up as bright as the neon lights of Zanarkand and the 
sounds of screaming and pure electricity flooded the air until the 
only thing that filled the black mage&#39;s senses was the smell of burnt 
flesh and the dim flow of the overhead halogens, barely managing to 
stand Lulu squinted through the oncoming darkness that was fogging her 
vision but the only sight that greeted her blurry eyes was that of 
Brother&#39;s maimed body, his frame still involuntarily jerking as small 
waves of lightening still surged through him. 

Smiling lightly Lulu&#39;s spent form fell to the floor like a disregarded 
toy that no longer was used for play, as unconsciousness took hold of 
her and sent her into a deep troubled sleep.
