&quot;Hello there, little boy.&quot;

The sound of a patronizingly sweet voice, the kind that even a child can 
recognize at age six as being utterly insincere, pulled the boy out of 
his fog of a daydream. Even though it had been a very vivid collage of 
cats, his favorite animal, he still couldn&#39;t piece it all together into 
a coherent whole. Instead he slowly looked up at the person who&#39;d spoken 
to him, the first to actually do so in days. She was a rather old woman, 
and while a week ago he would have made fun of her to her face the 
energy to do so had abandoned him since then. &quot;...Do you have a name? 
Don&#39;t be shy,&quot; the woman continued, occasionally casting an uneasy 
glance at the police officer accompanying the tyke.

&quot;...Kisuke,&quot; he answered finally, earning an even more obnoxious smile 
from the woman that he wasn&#39;t sure was supposed to make him feel good or 
not.

&quot;Here&#39;s his paperwork,&quot; the officer said gruffly as he let go of 
Kisuke&#39;s hand to give the woman a pen. &quot;Full name, Kisuke Urahara. His 
legal guardian disappeared about a week ago, and he was only found 
because he came to a neighbor&#39;s house looking for food.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s terrible,&quot; the woman said dully, not sounding like she thought 
it anything other than ordinary. &quot;...When did...&quot; At this point Kisuke 
tuned out the conversation, playing with the paper clip he&#39;d found on 
the floor of the policeman&#39;s car. He vaguely remembered the 
blue-uniformed man making a few attempts at amiable conversation, but 
he&#39;d gotten bored after the standard-issue small talk questions (&#39;What&#39;s 
your name,&#39; &#39;how old are you?&#39;), finding the little folded piece of wire 
more captivating. Its initial form was nothing special, but the 
possibilities it presented fascinated him, as capable of being a 
masterpiece as a block of marble is of being a statue.

&quot;Oh!&quot; the woman said as she fell out of conversation with the policeman, 
noticing the clip in Kisuke&#39;s hand and snatching it away. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t 
play with that-- you&#39;ll hurt yourself!&quot; The little blonde boy glared at 
the woman, angry at her intervention and at that obnoxious voice, but 
said nothing.

&quot;He&#39;s a, uh...little quiet, if you can tell,&quot; the officer said with a 
shrug as the caretaker grabbed her new charge&#39;s hand. &quot;...You sure he&#39;ll 
be all right here?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry-- I&#39;ll make sure that Kisuke-chan makes plenty of new 
friends. We&#39;ll watch over him much better than his father, at least.&quot;

----------

Even looking back at the place he&#39;d spent so much of his childhood at, 
Urahara still couldn&#39;t remember the name of the orphanage, the name of 
the obnoxious woman who&#39;d run it, the majority of the people he&#39;d lived 
and ate and fought over top bunk with. But then he&#39;d had the rather 
convenient habit of blocking out anything that he found even slightly 
uninteresting, that bored him. Two things he did remember, though. He 
remembered that the woman&#39;s guidance towards acceptance with the others 
wasn&#39;t what he wanted at all-- he&#39;d quickly begun making friends even if 
he&#39;d had to act cheerful and sociable to do so; it was a fairly easy 
mask to wear and he did so for the rest of his life with zeal. The other 
thing that stuck out with clarity even after 13 years was the first time 
he&#39;d met Yoruichi.&quot;Hey new kid! Move it, you&#39;re holding up the line.&quot; 
Kisuke turned from the water fountain to find a dark-skinned, scruffy 
looking girl standing behind him, a little taller than he and with short 
raven hair that stuck out at the sides. Normally the boy had enough good 
grace to treat the girls around him with a bit of chivalry, but after 
having to wake up early and be told by the caretaker that she was 
&#39;worried about his inattentiveness,&#39; not to mention he&#39;d nearly had a 
heart attack playing softball with a few of the guys, he was feeling 
less than willing to cooperate.

&quot;No way, I&#39;m thirsty! Wait your turn.&quot; He was just turning back around 
to take another drink when a strong hand grabbed the scruff of his 
t-shirt, turned him around, and he made eye contact with the girl 
moments before she broke his nose and shoved him to the ground. He 
stared up at her cold yellow eyes for a moment before what had happened 
actually clicked with him and he angrily wiped the blood dripping out of 
his orifice with his arm. &quot;Hey, you cand do dat, you dumb gurl!&quot;

&quot;Screw you!&quot; she growled back, and in spite of his defiance Kisuke felt 
himself flinch. He glanced at the other kids in line that she&#39;d cut in 
front of, hoping they&#39;d be equally indignant but they were all a fair 
distance away, fearful but still acting as if this was as much apart of 
their existence as the horrible food and the nearby jungle gym that had 
long ago rusted over. Once the girl was gone one of them ran over to 
him, a boy with curly dark hair and a rather long face.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Kisuke nodded, then accepted the hand-up as he wiped his 
nose again, frowning to find that it was smeared with fresh blood. &quot;A 
piece of advice-- Don&#39;t get that girl angry at you if you can avoid it. 
She can be a real bitch.&quot; In spite of the seriousness of his situation 
Kisuke giggled at the other boy&#39;s casual swear, then followed him inside 
to the nurse.

&quot;...Wad&#39;s gonna habben ib I ged her agry?&quot; the blonde asked through a 
clogged nose as they walked, and for an answer the boy pointed 
significantly at someone leaning forlornly against the wall of the 
orphanage, arm and leg wrapped in thick casts.

&quot;What&#39;s your name? You&#39;re new, right?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Yeah,&quot; Kisuke answered with a shrug, realizing that he was talking 
more than he had since he&#39;d gotten here a few days ago. &quot;...Id&#39;s 
Kisuke.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m Shusui. And don&#39;t worry, the nurse&#39;ll take good care of 
you--she&#39;s used to fixing broken noses around here.&quot;

----------

For a few weeks Kisuke took his new friend&#39;s advice, building up a bit 
of popularity as he gradually got used to his new home, and his athletic 
capabilities made him a rather good catch for either side of the 
occasional softball game or gateball practice. To counteract this the 
girl from before, who he&#39;d learned was called Yoruichi, started going 
out of her way to bother him-- a fact that only added to his growing 
respect among even the kids who&#39;d been here for their whole lives and 
were dealing with the early throes of puberty. Apparently, Yoruichi 
didn&#39;t take very kindly to people who stood out or made a big impression 
on others here, and the fact that everyone was afraid to so much as 
sneeze in her presence had maintained her status as a force to be 
reckoned with. Sometimes she simply threw his lunch away in front of 
him, or otherwise grabbed a kid in his line of sight (boy or girl didn&#39;t 
matter to her) and began to beat them senseless, as if daring him to 
challenge her.

Kisuke was smart enough to know better, however, and always looked away. 
He did feel bad, but it wasn&#39;t his problem, and he didn&#39;t need to go 
looking for a fight anyway. At least that was what he told himself 
before Yoruichi finally managed to make him snap.

----------

&quot;You&#39;d better be ready to pick that up,&quot; she said coldly as she glanced 
at the fallen bowl of cereal, milk and soggy cornflakes splattered on 
her ragamuffin sandals. Kisuke hesitated, the heat of every pair of eyes 
in the cramped dining room on them. He almost acquiesced, but like that 
day at the water fountain, a strange sort of rebelliousness gripped him.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;...Did you want to repeat that?&quot; Yoruichi asked as she stepped closer, 
venom dripping into her voice with each syllable.

&quot;C...clean up your own damn bowl,&quot; he managed after a swallow. In 
response Yoruichi promptly punched him in the face, glaring at him as if 
she was ready to kill him and was exercising all her self-control to 
avoid doing so.

&quot;I SAID CLEAN IT THE HELL U--&quot; she was silenced as the sound of knuckles 
connecting with bone sounded again, and it took the entire room, 
including Kisuke, a moment to realize that he&#39;d just hit his nemesis, a 
shiner on her right eye leaving incontrovertible evidence that he hadn&#39;t 
just imagined it. Yoruichi stared at him for a moment, but then shock 
boiled over into fury and she pounced on him with a growl, and the two 
started hitting at every inch of each other they could reach until one 
of the adults ran over and broke them up.

----------

&quot;...If you&#39;d just picked up the bowl, none of this would&#39;ve happened.&quot;

Kisuke turned to look at the girl sitting beside him on the bench 
outside the caretaker&#39;s office, his attention diverted from the hypnotic 
rhythm of bubbles caused by the nearby water cooler. Both were much 
worse for the wear now; Kisuke had a few bruises and bumps on his face 
while Yoruichi had a fat lip to accompany her black eye.

&quot;You started it,&quot; he retorted with as much tact and verbal prowess that 
a child can manage.

&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got a problem beating some more sense into you,&quot; she 
hissed at the blonde.

&quot;I managed to hit YOU a few times too, ya know.&quot; Yoruichi opened her 
mouth to continue the argument but only gave a petulant &quot;hmph&quot; and 
looked away.

&quot;...That&#39;s the first time in a while, you know.&quot;

&quot;Huh? I thought you weren&#39;t talking to me,&quot; Kisuke sneered at the girl&#39;s 
sudden declaration. Yoruichi ignored him, however, and continued 
speaking.

&quot;None of the boys have ever hit me since I first got here. I figured 
they were all just too wussy to do it, but you don&#39;t seem that tough at 
all.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; the blonde said while rolling his eyes at the &#39;compliment.&#39; He 
turned to the girl to say something else but somehow it never came out, 
he just glanced at her stoic profile for a moment until the old woman 
came out of the nearby door.

&quot;All right, you two can go back now-- but if I see you causing trouble 
again, Yoru-chan, it&#39;ll be time-out alone, understand?&quot;

&quot;...Fine,&quot; Yoruichi answered darkly as she tossed herself off the bench, 
Kisuke following along behind her. &quot;What are you doing, new kid?&quot; she 
asked after a moment of hearing his footsteps behind her in the hallway. 
&quot;...Don&#39;t you got someone else you can bother?&quot;

&quot;Who cares what I&#39;m doing...Yoru-chan?&quot; Yoruichi turned around at the 
sound of the pet name the caretaker had forced on her three years ago, 
grabbing the boy&#39;s collar and pulling him close with surprising 
strength.

&quot;Don&#39;t you EVER call me that again, you hear me? I HATE that stupid 
name!&quot; He knew that he was in a bad situation all over again, but 
somehow it occured to Kisuke that there was something about pressing 
this girl&#39;s buttons that he actually...enjoyed.

&quot;Oh, come on, Yoru-chan, don&#39;t be mean or you&#39;ll get a time out.&quot; As her 
eyes widened his bravado evaporated, and when her hand recoiled to 
deliver his punishment he was prepared to get on his knees and beg for 
forgiveness. At least he was, until he felt a smack on the top of his 
head that, while softer than her fist, still hurt.

&quot;Hmph. Wuss,&quot; she muttered under her breath as she walked away, leaving 
him in a heap on the floor. Kisuke rubbed his now-bruised crown and 
watched the girl walk away as he stood up, then muttered a curse of his 
own as he headed in the other direction.

----------

&quot;You&#39;re kidding! I don&#39;t remember it like that,&quot; Yoruichi said with a 
grin as she pushed her shoulder-length hair behind her ears.

&quot;Oh, come on...Don&#39;t tell me you really forgot that?&quot; the blonde 
chuckled in response. &quot;It was only a few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Well, I kicked a lot of kid&#39;s asses back then-- you can&#39;t expect me to 
rememeber them all.&quot; She gave Kisuke a teasing smile before jumping off 
the low wall of the public Middle school, landing gracefully on her 
feet. &quot;Come on, we&#39;d better get back inside before the bell rings.&quot; As 
Yoruichi tossed the remains of her lunch into the nearby trash can he 
couldn&#39;t help but feel a little glad, even though he knew she was just 
putting on an act for him.

After their fight at lunch all those years ago Yoruichi&#39;s behavior 
changed again; she suddenly began leaving Kisuke alone, and was actually 
friendly to him to a certain degree, greeting him with a curt nod at 
least, a wave of the hand at most. Even though he didn&#39;t quite know what 
was going on he had innately realized that they had reached an impasse 
of sorts, an unspoken bond of grudging respect that took him off her 
hostile radar. Yoruichi otherwise didn&#39;t change a bit even now; she 
still beat up anyone who happened to be in the vicinity when she was in 
a bad mood and never seemed to smile unless it was a sadistic sneer, but 
around Kisuke she gradually became softer, although he was the only 
beneficiary of this newfound benevolence. He never asked her why she was 
nice to him and she never offered him a reason, but he suspected that 
one of the reasons she lowered her guard with him was because he knew 
better than to bother her about stuff like that.

&quot;Oh, Kisuke!&quot; she said out of the blue as she pulled a small wad of cash 
out of her back pocket. &quot;Here-- in case you wanted to order out for 
dinner tonight.&quot; The teen accepted the money silently, stuffing it into 
his own pocket carelessly.

&quot;Oh, by the way...how&#39;s work going?&quot;

&quot;Ahh, a little slow,&quot; Yoruichi answered with a shrug. &quot;You know how 
people get at the grocery store--all those old ladies and stuff...&quot; Her 
companion nodded in acceptance, knowing the truth even though he was 
afraid to confront her with it. It hadn&#39;t surprised him when he caught 
her coming back to the orphanage late at night once, a handful of silver 
watches in her arms while the sound of other boys filled the street 
outside. But he knew better than to say anything--she&#39;d just say it 
wasn&#39;t his business, then threaten him again. Somehow, in spite of the 
fact that he knew she was a bad seed, especially since she&#39;d started 
hanging out with that Shiba girl and had added theft to her list of 
vices, he still couldn&#39;t bring himself to sever ties with her. Even 
though they were friendlier, they never talked about anything really 
personal. He didn&#39;t understand her any better at age 12 than he had at 
6, but he never complained. If this is what she wanted, than he&#39;d rather 
comply than drive her away.

----------

&quot;...You&#39;re what?&quot;

&quot;Believe it, Kisuke,&quot; Yoruichi said with a grin as she stuffed another 
shirt into her tattered briefcase. It was a few days after Yoruichi&#39;s 
fifteenth birthday, the snow outside the cramped building drifting in 
with the cold through the cracks in the orphanage&#39;s facade. &quot;...I&#39;m 
finally getting out of this hellhole. Just think about it-- I can&#39;t 
believe my worthless parents had that much money! I&#39;ll finally have my 
own place like you, and they had my name put down for Rukongai! I should 
be able to have some fun with the poor bastards out there...&quot; She smiled 
that mischevious grin that he had come to love so much, forcing him to 
turn away quietly.

He would never admit it to her face, but puberty had been kind to 
Yoruichi...TOO kind, in fact. She had blossomed rather early, and thanks 
to the revelation of her newfound power over the opposite sex (and a 
surprisingly great number of her own), she had all but abandoned 
thievery for a different sort of rush, finding people much more 
enjoyable when they were worshipping her body than when they were on the 
ground covered in blood.

&quot;Yoruichi...&quot;

&quot;Hmm? What is it?&quot; she asked gently, putting her briefcase down and 
looking at the young man with concern due to the tone of his voice. She 
was still the same...but with him, her bitterness disappeared, replaced 
by gratitude and even kindness for the only person she could really call 
her friend.

&quot;I...I was just thinking...&quot; he said as he swallowed the words longing 
to escape his throat, &quot;...are you really just going to the high school 
to play around?&quot;

&quot;...Well, what else am I gonna do?&quot; Yoruichi said with a chuckle, her 
carefree attitude reappearing with surprising ease. &quot;...I&#39;m barely 
making failing grades as I am now, just like you, pal.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think...that maybe it&#39;s time you calmed down a bit?&quot;

&quot;...Are you telling me what to do...Kisuke?&quot; she responded in a whisper 
as dangerous as those she had used when they had first met, advancing on 
him with flashing eyes.

&quot;N-no, I just...I just think that...you can do better than being in a 
gang, is all.&quot; Yoruichi stared at him for a moment, her fury evaporating 
as she considered his words. It was the first time he had ever really 
spoken his mind to her, and she turned away in silent consideration as 
he announced that he had to get home before long.

----------

&quot;&#39;Shinshun,&#39; you can&#39;t do this!&quot;

&quot;Come on!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious. I&#39;m through with this shit, and you guys should be too. 
It&#39;s boring.&quot; At the sound of the name &quot;God of Flash&quot; Urahara glanced 
over at Yoruichi from the other side of the street; she was talking to a 
few of the more unscrupulous members of her little gang, and he smiled 
in a small measure of pride as she casually walked away.

&quot;See guys?&quot; one of them said as she retreated. &quot;...I told you she was 
getting sof--&quot; the blonde turned away with a chuckle as the now familiar 
sound of Yoruichi&#39;s shoes meeting an unsuspecting face sounded in the 
distance. Now that he knew Yoruichi wasn&#39;t going to be involved with 
people like that anymore, he had to make sure that she&#39;d be all right 
where she was going. She was too smart, had too much hidden potential to 
spend the rest of her life in jail. Rukongai...her parents must really 
have been something-- it was nearly impossible to get in unless you had 
the smarts or the cash.

Fortunately he had plenty of the former, but he&#39;d kept his intellect 
hidden so that he could stay with Yoruichi-- otherwise he&#39;d easily be a 
college graduate by now. His grades were bad right now, so it looked 
like the only way in would be to pass the entrance test and get a 
scholarship. With that in mind, he promptly decided to get studying that 
evening.

----------

Once he had brought Soi to the present, he looked over to see the girl 
staring blankly into space. He remained silent for a moment, needing a 
moment to recover himself. Just talking about it all had made him 
realize just how long he&#39;d known her, how far they&#39;d come and how little 
she&#39;d really changed since that day at the drinking fountain. In fact, 
he couldn&#39;t remember ever seeing a genuine smile out of her. At least 
not until...

&quot;...You okay?&quot; he finally asked.

&quot;H-huh?&quot; Soi muttered, snapping out of her stunned trance. &quot;Y...Yeah. 
I&#39;m fine. I&#39;d, uh, better get home,&quot; she said quickly as she lifted 
herself off the curb, the slowly sinking sun casting shadows across the 
landscape and bringing a chill that accompanied the one running down the 
freshman&#39;s spine. &quot;...Urahara-san...Did Yoruichi...was she really like 
that?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; he answered. He wanted to say something more comforting to 
Yoruichi&#39;s friend, but either he couldn&#39;t think of anything or he didn&#39;t 
want to as she walked away in a daze. Once Soi had become a dot on the 
horizon he stood up. He knew that even now, he was still in love with 
his best friend, and regardless of whether or not she could ever feel 
that way about him or for anyone he knew what he had to do. It took him 
ten minutes to walk back home, and he resolved to skip classes tomorrow 
so he could get to the hospital. He had quite a task ahead of him now, 
but he wasn&#39;t about to let Yoruichi&#39;s effort go to waste.</pre>
