What am I doing here?

That was all Soi could ask herself as she stood outside the door to the 
gymnasium, debating on whether or not to go in. She had been thinking 
about what Yoruichi had said earlier about her joining the Karate Club-- 
which was strange in and of itself, considering that she didn&#39;t really 
enjoy sports at all and if it had come from anyone else she wouldn&#39;t 
have given it a second thought. But since it HAD come from the only 
person she could really consider a friend, the idea had slowly 
germinated in her mind during classes, growing larger and harder to 
ignore throughout lunch until she finally decided to at least try it. 
And thus she stood here now, after the final bell had rung and she 
normally would have been heading home now so that she could get her 
homework done. The girl with the long braids finally sighed, and turning 
the knob pushed the cool metal door open.

What she saw on the other side made her apprehension multiply tenfold. 
As if on cue just about every head in the room, each one attached to a 
body sitting cross-legged on mats and clothed in simple white gi, turned 
at the click of the door opening and acknowledged Soi Fong with 
questioning stares. Soi instantly felt the desire to run away as her shy 
inclinations threatened to overwhelm her, but before she could even 
begin to move the instructor noticed the girl.

&quot;Hello, young lady. Come sit down, don&#39;t be shy.&quot; Realizing that there 
really was no turning back now, Soi Fong walked to an open space among 
her fellow students, quite a few of whom seemed to be female, to her 
surprise.

&quot;Well,&quot; the instructor said once Soi had taken a place, looking 
distinctly outlandish in her uniform amongst the sea of pure white. 
&quot;...As you can see, we have an addition to our club as of today.&quot; He 
turned to the new girl and indicated that she should stand and introduce 
herself. Fighting down a blush, Soi jumped onto the balls of her feet 
and bowed low, resulting in a few snickers among the other girls.

&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m Soi Fong, C-Class 1-B.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re glad that you&#39;ve taken an interest in Karate, Miss Fong. My 
name is Byakuya Kuchiki of 4-A, but here you&#39;ll refer to me as 
Kuchiki-sensei,&quot; the stoic, long-haired instructor said as he calmly 
observed the petite girl. Even Soi Fong, who was normally impassive to 
those around her, thought the imposing man to be more than a little 
cold. &quot;...Is that understood?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; the freshman managed in a quiet voice.

&quot;Yes sensei,&quot; Byakuya gently corrected her.

&quot;...Yes, Kuchiki-sensei.&quot; Relieved that the humiliation was over, Soi 
Fong quickly squatted back onto the floor, noticing on her way down that 
Yoruichi (who gave her an encouraging wink) and another guy she didn&#39;t 
recognize with bright red hair and tattoos on his narrow face were 
sitting comfortably on either side of the instructor.

&quot;...As of today, we&#39;re going to be picking up where we left off last 
week,&quot; Byakuya began as if nothing had happened. &quot;Shihouin-san will take 
the advanced student girls (a fact that did not surprise Soi Fong in the 
slightest), while the advanced boys wills study with me and Abarai-san 
takes the intermediates. Rukia-san!&quot; A tiny girl at the front bowed (it 
was almost impossible to tell if she would have been taller standing up 
or not) at the sound of her name. &quot;...Can I trust you to take the 
beginners?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes, onii-san,&quot; Rukia answered, and after a few moments the organized 
rows of students disintegrated into a huddle of babbling teens as they 
headed off in different directions.

&quot;Well, over here, rookies,&quot; the girl who had called Byakuya &#39;brother&#39; 
said to the class as a whole, in order to allow the new kids to weed 
themselves out from the rest. Soi was about to follow Rukia to another 
corner of the room when she felt a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;...You said your name was &#39;Soi Fong, right?&quot; When the girl in question 
turned around, she nearly ran straight into a bosom that, to put mildly, 
simply defied logic. It almost surprised Soi when she looked up and saw 
that the enormous rack was sitting below the neckline of a tall redhead 
with curls-- she&#39;d almost assumed that it was its own lifeform entirely. 
&quot;Umm...I know we&#39;ve never met,&quot; the senior said as she extended her 
hand, &quot;...but I&#39;m--&quot;

&quot;...Rangiku Matsumoto, right?&quot; Soi finished with such ease that the 
upperclassman smiled.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s right! How did you know my name?&quot; The shorter girl declined 
to mention that Matsumoto&#39;s infamous cup size had ensured that she&#39;d 
overheard the name spoken by just about every horny teen in the school.

&quot;...Easy. You&#39;re Ichimaru&#39;s girlfriend, right?&quot; She said it as politely 
as she could, but Soi couldn&#39;t hide just a bit of resentment from 
finding its way into her tone. Rangiku&#39;s face became neutral as she 
picked up on the freshman&#39;s additude and for a moment Soi cringed as she 
waited for the hammer to fall. What the busty redhead did next, however, 
completely surprised her-- she put her hands together in the traditional 
gesture of apology and did a little half-bow.

&quot;...Actually, the reason I wanted to talk to you was about Gin--I&#39;m 
really, really sorry he&#39;s been teasing you!&quot;

...&#39;Teasing?&#39; Soi blanched at how Ichimaru&#39;s incessant torture had been 
whitewashed into something that sounded almost laughable, but she had to 
admit that an apology, even if it wasn&#39;t coming from the bastard 
himself, was better than nothing.

&quot;Oh--Really, it&#39;s no big deal...&quot; She started with a wave of the hand, 
but the other girl shook her head.

&quot;No, it is! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m gonna straighten him out about all this the 
next time I see him!&quot; Noticing the green belt around Matsumoto&#39;s gi, Soi 
felt fairly certain that there would be more exchanged than just &#39;a few 
words.&#39; Before Soi could respond, Rukia called in her direction.

&quot;Hey, newbie! This isn&#39;t a freakin&#39; coffee shop-- You can mince words 
with your girlfriends later!&quot;

&quot;Oh, jeez--I need to get with my group too!&quot; Rangiku said as her eyes 
widened and she dashed to another end of the gym, waving a goodbye to 
Soi, who only responded with a confused look before she walked over to 
her place among the other beginners.

&quot;Now that Miss Congeniality&#39;s decided to join us...&quot; Rukia said with an 
arched eyebrow in Soi&#39;s direction, to which a few chuckled. The youngest 
of the Kuchiki children, however, was not amused. &quot;HEY!&quot; she said in a 
voice of pure authority, which made everyone present shudder 
involuntarily despite Rukia&#39;s small size. She walked up to the one who&#39;d 
laughed, a fairly tall boy with medium-length brown hair and a long 
face. &quot;...I DON&#39;T THINK I SAID YOU COULD LAUGH, DID I!&quot;

...They&#39;re DEFINITELY siblings, Soi considered quietly as she watched 
the boy cower from Rukia&#39;s death glare, almost as intimidating as 
Byakuya&#39;s.

&quot;...what&#39;s your name, Mr. I-Think-Everything&#39;s-Funny?&quot;

&quot;K-Keigo. Keigo Asano,&quot; the boy answered nervously, not wanting to anger 
Rukia further.

&quot;All right, Asano-kun,&quot; Rukia said as her face softened into an 
apparently kindhearted smile, &quot;...I know something that&#39;ll get some 
laughs.&quot; She walked onto a wide plastic gymnastics mat, taking off her 
shoes as she went and setting them neatly together on the floor, 
gesturing for Keigo to do the same. &quot;...Come up here, please,&quot; she said 
in a voice too sweet to not be suspicious. He hesitated for only a 
moment, looking apprehensive, but finally someone behind him gave Keigo 
a push, the momentum of which made him hobble forward and leaving him no 
chance to escape. He sighed as he imitated Rukia, leaving his shoes 
paired beside his sensei&#39;s. &quot;...I want you to attack me,&quot; the 
upperclassman said as she casually stood in front of him.

&quot;W-what?&quot; Keigo managed, uncertain of what the tiny brown-belt had 
planned.

&quot;Don&#39;t be shy, Asano-kun,&quot; Rukia said in a wide, almost Ichimaru-esque 
grin that forced Soi to stifle a chuckle with the back of her hand. The 
brown-haired boy took a gulp as he planted his feet, shaking his head to 
psych himself up.

&quot;...Okay, here goes,&quot; he muttered just before running at his sensei. 
When he was within range, he threw his fist straight out, aiming for her 
face and hoping that he wouldn&#39;t accidentally hurt her. At the last 
second, however, Rukia sidestepped so that she was centered with Kiego 
(who was still running toward her), and in one swift, blinding movement, 
was standing over a very surprised and sore boy. While he was busy 
struggling to understand how he had somehow ended up on the ground, the 
beginners broke into peals of laughter while Rukia bent over him, still 
smiling.

&quot;...There we go. Now wasn&#39;t that funny?&quot; The tiny girl said with feigned 
glee.

&quot;W-what are you talking about!&quot; Keigo managed after a few moments of 
stuttering. &quot;I had no idea you were going to THROW me!&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s okay--I think the rest of us enjoyed it.&quot; Rukia gave a much 
more fearful Keigo a hand up, then waited a few moments for the laughter 
to die down before switching back to her serious demeanor. &quot;Now, that 
move I just performed-- by the time you&#39;re an Orange Belt, you&#39;ll be 
able to start to learn how to defend yourself by using your opponent&#39;s 
weight against you. Despite what many of you may be thinking, that&#39;s 
what Karate is for: self-defense, not for attacking others. Moreover, 
Karate is an art form; it&#39;s a means for one to attain a sense of oneness 
with themselves and the world around them. And since the most important 
part of the martial arts is discipline...&quot; Rukia&#39;s eyes narrowed as she 
could almost feel the disappointment emanating from the impatient 
beginners, &quot;...Today we will spend the period in silent meditation.&quot; 
Sure enough, an almost synchronized groan came from the mass of 
students.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oww...damnit...

Soi rubbed her calf as she tried to pull herself up, but after sitting 
cross-legged for over an hour both her legs had fallen asleep and were 
threatening to cramp if she moved too quickly.

&quot;Hey, are you still here?&quot; Soi looked up to see Yoruichi walking out of 
the women&#39;s locker room, a towel hung around her neck and her gi 
exchanged for a black tank top and navy-blue running pants, the material 
of which crinkled with every step the coffee-toned girl took. 
&quot;Umm...What are you still doing on the ground? Everyone&#39;s already gone 
home...&quot; The freshman&#39;s eyes shifted around nervously before answering 
in a low mutter.

&quot;...My leg&#39;s asleep.&quot; As she had feared, Yoruichi responded with a loud, 
almost cackling laugh. &quot;It&#39;s not funny! I&#39;m not used to sitting like 
this!&quot; the Chinese girl said defensively. After a few minutes, Yoruichi 
calmed down, but still let out a few snickers as she got on her knees 
and grabbed one of Soi&#39;s legs.

&quot;Hey, what are you-- OWW!&quot; Soi began, her face involuntarily turning red 
at the sudden contact, but her protestations were cut short as Yoruichi 
pulled the leg straight, pushing so that the prickling muscles hurt 
worse than before.

&quot;Just relax,&quot; Yoruichi said with a roll of the eyes and a hint of an 
amused smile; Soi could tell that there would be no arguing with her, so 
she simply sighed and allowed the upperclassman to inflict more pain on 
her. After a few minutes in this uncomfortable position, Yoruichi 
released her hold on the appendage. &quot;There--How&#39;s that?&quot; Soi was about 
to complain that it hurt worse now, but after a few seconds she realized 
that her leg wasn&#39;t prickling anymore.

&quot;...It&#39;s...it&#39;s better, actually!&quot; She wiggled her foot around, 
stretching the tendons before standing up with no trouble. &quot;Thanks!&quot; she 
said with a smile.

&quot;Oh, hey--it&#39;s no problem. Once you&#39;ve done it for a few weeks, you&#39;ll 
get used to it. So,&quot; Yoruichi asked as she pulled her long hair back 
into a ponytail and secured it with a strip of biege-colored cloth, 
&quot;...Did you like it? The club, I mean.&quot;

&quot;...Well...&quot; Soi wanted to say that she had hated practically the whole 
experience-- from the so-called &#39;meditation&#39; and her tough-as-nails 
sensei to the smell of sweat that permeated the air, but she didn&#39;t want 
to let Yoruichi think she wasn&#39;t grateful for being considerate of her. 
&quot;You see--&quot;

&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; Before the braided girl could make some form of denial, 
Yoruichi interrupted her with a wry grin. &quot;Ahh, you wouldn&#39;t be the only 
one who hated this group after only one meeting. Most people just don&#39;t 
have the patience to stick with it long enough for it to get good, you 
know?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; Soi began but her voice faded off, her eyes casual and 
uncaring as they walked toward the exit.

&quot;Hey, come over here.&quot; The braided girl looked around to see that 
Yoruichi had somehow stopped walking beside her and was now standing 
atop one of the gym mats, her shoes tossed on the floor haphazardly.

&quot;...Wait, why?&quot; she asked curiously, trying not to look interested but 
unable to prevent it from showing on her face.

&quot;Just come here. And don&#39;t forget to take your shoes off, too.&quot; Soi 
relented and did as Yoruichi asked, standing in a spot that the 
upperclassman indicated with her finger. &quot;Okay--now stand with your feet 
like this.&quot; Yoruichi set her feet parallel with her shoulders, her toes 
pointing straight ahead.

&quot;...Wait...&quot; the freshman said as she realized what Yoruichi was doing, 
&quot;...I thought we weren&#39;t supposed to learn actual techniques yet.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; the tall girl said with an uncharacteristically serious 
expression. &quot;As a beginner, you&#39;re not allowed to learn this stuff yet. 
Or at least--&quot; her face turned back to its normal mischevious grin as 
she finished, &quot;...that&#39;s what Byakuya-kun thinks. I, however, know from 
experience that you&#39;ve definitely got the potential to do well here, so 
I wanna give you a head start.&quot;

&quot;B...but won&#39;t Kuchiki-sensei be angry with you?&quot; Soi asked nervously. 
The black-belt, however, made a little noise that was half-snort, 
half-chuckle.

&quot;Feh. Byakuya-kun may seem tough, but if I had a strawberry for every 
time I&#39;ve beaten him, I&#39;d have a lifetime&#39;s worth of smoothies right 
now.&quot; At that, they both shared a laugh, Soi once again impressed by her 
friend&#39;s strength. &quot;Now,&quot; Yoruichi said as she settled back into her 
stance, &quot;...Let&#39;s try a few basic punches, all right?&quot; Feeling far more 
comfortable with her friend than she had with her peers, Soi smiled as 
she stood next to Yoruichi, planting her feet as the other woman had 
told her.</pre>
