The dim sunlight pouring through shade-covered windows, combined with 
instinctively snapping herself awake pulled Soi back to the land of 
consciousness, if only in the literal sense of the term. As the freshman 
experimentally moved her head, she nearly yelped out loud, the crick in 
her neck painfully advising her against sleeping in this position in the 
future. Knowing that she needed some aspirin, Soi prepared to get up 
before remembering why she had to sleep on the couch in the first place. 
She looked down at the still sleeping Yoruichi, her eyes nearly popping 
out of her skull when they wandered just enough to see that her hand had 
somehow found its way into the older girl&#39;s hair. Before she could give 
herself the opportunity to blush, Soi practically jumped out from under 
Yoruichi, who didn&#39;t wake even when her head thudded against the 
cushions of the couch.

What the...? Soi thought in delayed surprise when she saw that her 
movement had made no effect of her friend&#39;s restfulness. If I&#39;d known 
that she slept like a rock then I would&#39;ve moved! Ultimately deciding 
that she had no one to blame but herself for her current state of 
discomfort, Soi gave a slight huff of annoyance and walked to the nearby 
bathroom.

Well, hopefully she&#39;s at least got some painkillers or something, the 
young girl mused as she rubbed her sore neck. Fortunately, buried behind 
a box of high-end bandages and cotton swabs was a half-bottle of 
aspirin, the lid of which Soi removed with ease and gratefully swallowed 
a pair of the small white pills, washing them down with a palmful of 
water from the tap. Once she had allowed a few moments for the medicine 
to take effect, she glanced up at the clock when she suddenly realized 
how curious she was about the time. She did a double take as her prior 
obligation came back to her attention.

...It can&#39;t be that late... Desperate for a second opinion, Soi lifted 
her watch arm to her face, only to see that the time was in fact 
correct.

Oh, damnit! 8:53! The test!

On pure instinct, Soi dashed out of the bathroom and to Yoruichi&#39;s front 
door, grabbing her bookbag on the way.

Okay, I&#39;ve got my shoes, my homework, my gi...

As her karate uniform entered her mental checklist of things she needed, 
Soi halted a few steps from the threshold.

Wait a minute... Oh God, please let me be wrong...

When it came to having bad feelings, Soi&#39;s gut instincts were usually 
right on the mark, and since she&#39;d been wrong about her early judgement 
of Yoruichi she was long overdue to be correct. With a bit of hurried 
trepidation, Soi unzipped her bookbag, tossing folders and a few 
textbooks out with abandon (had she not been so preoccupied with her 
belongings, she would have noticed that Yoruichi was STILL sleeping 
through the clamor she was raising). Unfortunately, the object of her 
search was nowhere to be found.

Where is it? I thought I packed it...wait... Suddenly she remembered 
that she had left her gi BESIDE her backpack the day before yesterday, 
in preparation of packing it with her things but had forgotten it in the 
rush of a late morning. With no uniform, she couldn&#39;t expect her sensei 
to take her seriously as a student prepared to take a belt test. After a 
few moments spent in disbelieving, frustrated silence, Soi dropped the 
now-empty backpack to the ground, then quietly opened the front door, 
stepping out onto Yoruichi&#39;s front step and being careful to close up 
behind her. Once she was certain that the door was safely closed, she 
took a deep breath and shattered the early morning stillness.

&quot;DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!&quot; Soi was sure she&#39;s seen a flock of birds scatter 
from the nearby trees at her uncharacteristic outburst, but at the 
moment she didn&#39;t care. She continued yelling for a few minutes, cursing 
her own absentmindedness and Yoruichi&#39;s sickness and Kuchiki-sensei&#39;s 
scheduling sensibilities and her alarm clock for failing to wake her up 
properly yesterday. Fortunately for her, the houses in this neighborhood 
were far enough apart that she could yell her heart out free of the fear 
of being reported by the still-sleeping populace. Once she&#39;d vented 
enough to avoid breaking something, Soi suddenly heard her stomach 
growl.

...I&#39;m starving, the freshman thought with a bit of embarrassment, then 
headed back inside. I guess I might as well have a decent breakfast.

Remembering the &#39;medicine&#39; Urahara had left for Yoruichi, Soi pulled the 
eggs out of the fridge, along with a partly finished half-gallon of milk 
and a small block of cheese.

Well, it&#39;s not much, she though with a raised eyebrow, but I&#39;ll probably 
just screw it up anyway-- best if I don&#39;t empty out her entire cupboard 
in the process. After a few minutes of searching in the massive dining 
area, Soi managed to gather a skillet, small bowl, and a sharp kitchen 
knife, all of which she set on the counter as she flipped on the 
front-burner of the stove. She was in the middle of cracking eggs when 
she heard a yawn and the sound of bare feet coming towards her.

&quot;Oh--Good morning, Yoruichi-san!&quot; Soi greeted warmly. It took the 
still-tired upperclassman, in the middle of rubbing her sleep-filled 
eyes, a few moments to answer back.

&quot;M...mornin&#39;.

&quot;How are you feeling? You sound a lot better now.&quot; Indeed, Yoruichi&#39;s 
near-unintelligible congestion of the previous day had diminished to a 
mere sniffle.

&quot;Ahh...Lots better, thanks to you. Hey,&quot; Yoruichi&#39;s eyes opened a little 
wider as she suddenly sniffed at the air, waking up a little more as she 
caught the unmistakable scent of butter on hot metal. &quot;...What are you 
makin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Well, since you&#39;ve got a bunch, I thought I&#39;d make some eggs,&quot; Soi 
answered, holding up the bowlful of four half-mixed yolks. &quot;...I was 
planning to just make scrambled--I hope it&#39;s not a problem.&quot;

&quot;Uh...No, that sounds great,&quot; Yoruichi said with a widening smile at the 
prospect of a hot breakfast. &quot;Is there something I can do to help you 
out?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, you should just relax, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

&quot;Really, if you need an extra pair of hands, it&#39;s no problem. Besides, 
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re sick of taking care of me--&quot;

&quot;N-no, it&#39;s not that!&quot; Soi managed quickly, pouring the mixture of egg 
and milk into the skillet, which let out a gratifying sizzle as it hit 
the pan. &quot;Really, it&#39;s no problem, Yoruichi-san--I like making 
breakfast. Now just sit there and I&#39;ll make you some coffee, okay?&quot; 
Before Yoruichi could protest, Soi held out a container of ground beans 
(which she&#39;d found by chance on her sweep of the kitchen cabinets 
earlier) and started to wander about the kitchen. &quot;So, where&#39;s you&#39;re 
coffee maker?&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, in the corner near the window,&quot; Yoruichi answered pointing away 
from her. When Soi turned around, her jaw dropped straight to the floor. 
Instead of a nice, normal, SIMPLE coffee machine, the Shihouin house was 
equipped with a horribly complicated-looking monstrosity of metal and 
chrome. She stared at the thing bewildered for a few moments until 
Yoruichi spoke up from her seat nearby. &quot;Um, Soi...&quot;

&quot;Uh,&quot; the younger girl began nervously, not wanting to admit defeat 
before she&#39;d even tried using the coffee maker. &quot;D...don&#39;t worry, I, 
uh...know how to use these, I just, um...&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that...&quot; Yoruichi answered casually as Soi suddenly caught 
the acrid scent of something burning. The freshman turned around just in 
time to see her forgotten eggs smoking on the stove, which elicited a 
long string of &quot;oh, crap, oh crap!&quot; from Soi as she hurriedly struggled 
to turn the uncooked side over. &quot;Uh, here,&quot; Yoruichi said, holding back 
an amused grin as she walked past a very disgruntled Soi, &quot;..How about I 
take care of the coffee?&quot; Soi put up no argument this time; she was too 
busy grumbling to herself about the possibly-ruined eggs to notice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;...Well? How is it?&quot; Yoruichi was taking a little too long to answer 
Soi&#39;s question than she knew she should have. The first bite she&#39;d taken 
of Soi&#39;s spirited but failed attempt at making scrambled egg with cheese 
had made a loud &#39;crunch&#39; inside her mouth. She was fairly certain that 
eggs, unless eaten raw straight from the shell, were not supposed to 
make that sound, but she slowly chewed the small chunk of food anyway, 
willing to at least see if it got any better if she continued. It 
didn&#39;t.

&quot;C...can I be honest with you?&quot; Yoruichi asked with a slightly worried 
smile once she&#39;d washed down the culinary abomination with a gulp of 
coffee sweetened to the point that it was more like hot chocolate than 
fermented bean juice.

&quot;...Yeah...&quot;

&quot;...This stuff is terrible!&quot; Yoruichi managed as she broke into 
laughter. To her surprise, Soi was far from offended; in fact she was 
laughing right along with her.

&quot;Oh God, I know! To tell the truth, I can&#39;t cook worth jack!&quot; Once the 
two girls had calmed down, they took turns eating from a plateful of 
buttered toast that Yoruichi had prepared along with the coffee, the 
flavor of which Soi was enjoying greatly. &quot;Man, this is kinda sad--I try 
to make you a nice breakfast and you basically ended up making the only 
stuff that&#39;s actually edible.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Well, don&#39;t get the wrong idea,&quot; Yoruichi smiled wryly as she 
walked over to the coffee machine and poured herself another cup, taking 
a moment to add just a bit of sugar and honey to the dark liquid. 
&quot;...Coffee and toast are about the only things I CAN make on my own. 
Usually Kisuke comes over if I wanna do anything else.&quot; Soi smile 
dropped in spite of herself at the mention of the hat-donning 
upperclassman, but she managed to catch herself before her friend 
noticed.

&quot;...So, then he&#39;s here a lot?&quot; she asked with a nervousness she 
struggled to hide but whose presence made no sense to her.

&quot;Yeah, practically at least once a day. Now that guy-- if there&#39;s one 
thing he can really do right, it&#39;s cook. I probably would&#39;ve starved to 
death a long time ago if it wasn&#39;t for him,&quot; the older girl said with a 
chuckle even though she was only half-joking.

...He comes over that often just to cook? For some reason, the 
information Yoruichi had just imparted to her along with her unanswered 
query of the previous evening made Soi curious.

&quot;But Yoruichi-san...Why do you need him here for that when your parents 
can take care of meals? In fact...&quot; Soi glanced out of the kitchen and 
towards the stairs, &quot;...Why haven&#39;t I seen them yet? Do they get in 
really late or...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have parents.&quot;

As soon as Yoruichi said those words in her normal tone of voice, Soi 
blinked in shock before immediately going into a desperate plea for 
forgiveness.

&quot;...Oh, Jesus...I&#39;m so, SO sorry! I didn&#39;t know--well, that&#39;s no excuse, 
I should&#39;ve been more tactful than th--!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right...Really, it&#39;s okay!&quot; Yoruichi repeated when her initial 
dismissal of her friend&#39;s apology went unheard. &quot;It happened a long time 
ago.&quot; She said this last part with a no-big-deal sort of shrug, but Soi, 
who had only lost her mother and still felt sad about it, couldn&#39;t 
accept that anyone could take the death of their family so casually.

&quot;B...but don&#39;t you miss them? And another thing...&quot; she spread her hands 
out wide to indicate the massive house they were eating in. &quot;How can you 
afford this place on your own?&quot;

&quot;Well, my parents left all their assents to me when they died, and this 
house along with everything in it was part of the will,&quot; Yoruichi 
answered matter-of-factly. &quot;I was only able to move in a few years ago, 
just because I wasn&#39;t of the proper age to inherit it. As for my mom and 
dad...I don&#39;t miss them that much, mainly just because I barely remember 
them at all. It&#39;s just not something that&#39;s worth worrying about for 
me.&quot; Soi looked at her friend curiously, wanting to speak but unable to 
find the right way to put her thoughts into words. There were so many 
more questions she wanted to ask Yoruichi about herself now that she&#39;d 
had the slightest inkling of her friend&#39;s childhood, but part of her was 
still afraid that she might go too far and make her friend angry.

&quot;I...I&#39;m really sorry, Yoruichi-sa--&quot;

&quot;Come on, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi said with a roll of the eyes from across the 
table, &quot;...What did I tell you about apologizing?&quot; Before Soi could give 
a proper answer, a door slammed from the direction of the front door, 
followed by a loud &quot;Yoru-chan!&quot; that echoed in the spacious house. A few 
moments later Urahara walked into the kitchen, his hat absent from being 
tossed onto the living room couch.

&quot;Oh, here you are...And Miss Fong, too! Well, how are you feeling, 
Yor--&quot; He was rendered speechless when Soi walked right up to the blonde 
teen, squaring off with him and sporting a particularly nasty look.

&quot;What the hell were you thinking, bringing that crap to a sick person!&quot; 
Urahara looked at her puzzled, but before he could answer Soi began her 
ranting anew. &quot;All you needed to bring Yoruichi-san was cough medicine 
and some soup, not your quaint little &#39;home remedy!&#39;&quot;

&quot;...Hey, Soi...&quot; Yoruichi called uncertainly, bewildered by the sudden 
change in her friend&#39;s behavior, but the younger girl was so focused on 
chewing out Kisuke that she didn&#39;t notice.

&quot;...And besides, if you knew Yoruichi-san was sick you could&#39;ve taken 
FIVE MINUTES out of your incredibly busy schedule to tell me! I&#39;m her 
friend too, you know! Since you couldn&#39;t be bothered to take care of her 
yourself--&quot;

&quot;Soi, it&#39;s FINE!&quot; Yoruichi said so loudly that the room&#39;s two other 
occupants turned to her, stunned. The oldest female in the room 
continued, but in a much quieter tone. &quot;...I&#39;m doing fine now. It&#39;s no 
big deal, okay?&quot; Soi opened her mouth as if to argue that it WAS a big 
deal, but upon taking a moment to consider that she was yelling at a 
perfectly well-meaning (she assumed) person over a matter that wasn&#39;t 
worth blaming anyone for, her quiet inclinations took over and she sat 
down, looking ashamed of herself.

&quot;Uh...Hey, in my defense,&quot; Urahara said once the shock of Soi Fong 
yelling at him over his oldest friend&#39;s health had subsided, &quot;...Raw 
eggs and sake always worked for ME when I was a kid, and Yoruichi 
doesn&#39;t get sick too much, so...&quot; Kisuke&#39;s statement ended in an 
apologetic, if slightly befuddled look which Yoruichi ignored in favor 
of another bite of toast. &quot;Oh... I&#39;m sorry, did I interrupt breakfast?&quot; 
Urahara had just noticed the blackened eggs sitting in the center of the 
table and couldn&#39;t pass the opportunity to make a little joke, even if 
it did result in another angry glare from Soi.

&quot;For your information, Soi&#39;s been here all night. I can honestly say 
that I&#39;d still be sitting in that bed if she hadn&#39;t gotten me something 
yesterday.&quot; Soi turned back to her toast as Yoruichi finished her 
statement and smiled appreciatively at her, the younger girl only just 
succeeding in hiding a deep blush that didn&#39;t escape the scrutiny of the 
young man standing behind her.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; Kisuke said evenly, deciding that what 
he&#39;d just seen Soi do was more a trick of the eye than anything else, &quot; 
...But you should still be resting. You don&#39;t just get over these things 
in one night, you know.&quot; Yoruichi nodded admissively as she took another 
sip of her coffee, yawning in spite of the drink&#39;s intended effect of 
keeping her alert.

&quot;Ahh...I&#39;ll take a nap in a little while, once the java&#39;s worn off.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...Well, in the meantime,&quot; Kisuke said with a grin as he walked to 
the fridge and pulled out the alcohol he&#39;d sent previously, &quot;...How 
about we celebrate your good health with some sake?&quot;

&quot;So THAT&#39;S why you came here, isn&#39;t it!&quot; Soi yelled in exasperation at 
the audacity of Urahara&#39;s request, while Yoruichi only rolled her eyes 
as if she&#39;d seen this many times before.

&quot;Damn straight it is! I paid good money for this stuff--had to pull 
quite a few strings to get it, too--so if you think I&#39;m gonna let this 
go to waste, then you&#39;re crazy!&quot; Without further ado, Kisuke snapped the 
lid off the bottle, releasing the scent of sweet rice wine into the 
room. &quot;Oh, and by the way, Soi-chan,&quot; he said turning to the 
further-disgruntled girl with braids, &quot;...I&#39;ve got the day off today, so 
I can take care of Yoru-chan. You can go home if you want.&quot; Without 
bothering to wait, Soi&#39;s anger toward the blonde senior was rekindled 
once more.

&quot;Excuse me, Yoruichi-san...NOT &#39;Yoru-chan&#39;... isn&#39;t feeling well, and I 
have no problem with staying here as long as it ta--&quot;

&quot;No, really Soi--I&#39;m feeling a lot better,&quot; Yoruichi spoke up as she 
took a moment to drain her cup of coffee in a single gulp. &quot;...And 
besides, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re tired. Go home and relax a little bit. I 
insist,&quot; she added when she noticed that her dark-haired friend was 
about to protest. Soi hesitated defiantly for a moment, not wanting to 
leave Yoruichi alone with Urahara (though she knew that he wouldn&#39;t be 
foolish enough to do anything to her even if he WAS drunk), but after a 
few moments she nodded admissively.

&quot;...All right, Yoruichi-san. I hope to see you in school on Monday,&quot; she 
said shyly as Yoruichi waved farewell and Urahara made a half-hearted 
wave over his shoulder, as he was currently preoccupied with getting a 
glass for his alcohol from the overhead cabinets. He had poured himself 
a cupfull of the rice wine and was about to down in it one swig when a 
small, pale hand grabbed the glass AND the accompanying bottle out of 
his hand. He blinked himself back to reality just in time to see Soi 
Fong pouring the sake down the nearby sink.

&quot;H-hey! What the hell are y--&quot; Kisuke managed to stutter out as he 
helplessly watched half-a-day&#39;s worth of work banished to the dregs of 
the plumbing. When Soi turned around, there was no sadistic look of 
satisfaction on her face; it was more the strict, no-nonsense expression 
of a schoolteacher who&#39;d found a student breaking the rules.

&quot;You can be drunk on your own time, but I&#39;m not going to let you molest 
Yoruichi-san when YOU offered to take care of her.&quot; Before he even had a 
chance to be upset, Soi marched out of the kitchen. Once the sound of a 
far-off door being shut echoed in the house, signaling Soi Fong&#39;s 
departure, he exploded.

&quot;What the...Jeez! To just toss that out!&quot; he grumbled, more to himself 
than anyone else. &quot;I mean, that was top-quality stuff, too! What kinda 
nerve does she...Hey, what&#39;s so funny?&quot; He turned at the sound of an odd 
little noise coming from Yoruichi&#39;s direction to see his dark-skinned 
confidant covering her mouth with her hand, shivering as if she was 
freezing cold.

&quot;N...nothing,&quot; Yoruichi lied once she&#39;d managed to stop giggling long 
enough to answer.</pre>
