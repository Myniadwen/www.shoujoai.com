&quot;...Wow,&quot; Kuukaku muttered once her friend had finished relating the 
general points of her and Soi&#39;s reconciliation, a smirk finding its way 
to her face as the news sunk in. Yoruichi hadn&#39;t told her about how 
she&#39;d cried into the younger girl&#39;s arms, though-- part of her felt like 
it was a private thing between them, a moment that had cemented a 
foundation on which their relationship could build. &quot;...I&#39;ve gotta say, 
I never thought of you as the &#39;monogamous&#39; type.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. That makes two of us,&quot; the dark upperclassman muttered back as 
she lightly scratched the side of her face. She cast a glance back at 
Soi&#39;s house as she adjusted herself on the front step, then reluctantly 
turned back around.

&quot;...Soi&#39;s a great kid. I&#39;m glad for you,&quot; the Shiba woman said with a 
surprising degree of sincerity. &quot;But... I have to ask what you were 
going to do.&quot;

&quot;Well, not much... I was just planning on spending the evening with 
her--&quot;

&quot;You KNOW what I mean, Yoruichi.&quot; Upon catching the tone in her friend&#39;s 
voice Yoruichi turned to face her, locking eyes with the surprisingly 
sober Kuukaku before her. &quot;Have you talked to Urahara at all since 
then?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll take that as a &#39;no,&#39;&quot; Kuukaku said evenly as she assessed the 
evasive look on Yoruichi&#39;s face.

&quot;I just...I don&#39;t know what to say to him.&quot;

&quot;Well, you apologized, right?&quot; Yoruichi gave a slight nod in response. 
&quot;Well, then I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be able to forgive you. It sounds like he 
understood your situation pretty well. And you guys have known each 
other forever!&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t make what I did to him right.&quot; Kuukaku groaned as she ran 
her fingers restlessly through her hair, then let it rest at her side 
once she&#39;d tired of making herself look even more unruly than normal.

&quot;And what about Soi? What are you going to do about your trip?&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t know,&quot; Yoruichi answered after a few silent moments.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m gonna leave you two alone,&quot; the other girl said suddenly as 
she got herself off the step, brushing off the now-dirty back of her 
jeans. &quot;But you should think about it, Yoruichi. You don&#39;t have very 
long.&quot;

Yoruichi watched her friend go quietly, pondering her final words as she 
disappeared in the distance.

----------

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Yoruichi shook herself out of her reverie at the sound of Soi Fong&#39;s 
voice, smiling at her even as she struggled to keep her hands from 
making the car stray too far in either direction. She felt a hand 
lightly fall on her shoulder, fingertips squeezing slightly in concern. 
The upperclassman&#39;s smile got just a little wider at the contact.

&quot;I&#39;m fine...just thinking, is all.&quot; Soi grinned herself, a slight blush 
creeping onto her cheeks as she leaned over just enough to rest her head 
on the older girl&#39;s arm.

&quot;So...where did you wanna go so badly?&quot;

Yoruichi said nothing, only allowing a mischevious grin to appear on her 
lips as she made a right turn, the sign of Homounka visible from their 
location even without its neon lit. Soi smiled at her, aware of exactly 
what she had in mind.

----------

It was dark by the time they returned, Soi opening the front door of her 
house with an effort as they both struggled to stop laughing, still 
giddy from the lingering exhilaration hanging over them both. On a whim 
Yoruichi reached out for the younger girl, twirling her in an 
exaggerated waltz spin before pulling her back into her arms to dip her 
down, Soi&#39;s face still lit up in a glad smile.

&quot;Well, I guess you&#39;re not COMPLETELY beyond hope--as far as dancing&#39;s 
concerned,&quot; Yoruichi teased as she let Soi back on her feet, eyes 
following the girl&#39;s lithe form as she adjusted her slightly sagging 
jeans.

&quot;well, no thanks to you anyway,&quot; Soi responded with a wicked grin, but 
Yoruichi caught her arm and pulled her close again, this time the snug 
embrace of the tango.

&quot;You know... everyone was looking at you today.&quot;

&quot;...And YOU know how I feel about cheap flattery, Yoruichi.&quot; Soi was 
trying her best to keep up her mask of sexual confidence and grace, but 
the senior&#39;s proximity to her threatened to turn her into putty all over 
again. At least, in this moment it did.

&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; Yoruichi muttered quietly, leaning in close enough that 
Soi could see the slight flush on her dark skin, but whether it was from 
all the exercise or something else Soi couldn&#39;t tell. &quot;Even seeing you 
in street clothes... Let&#39;s just say I was having trouble keeping it in 
my pants.&quot; Yoruichi&#39;s voice was joking but the look in her eyes said 
otherwise, and it made a shiver of anticipation run through the younger 
girl.

In less than a second-- during which an unspoken question was answered 
with equal silence-- their lips were together, Soi&#39;s mouth pressed 
against an equally enthusiastic Yoruichi&#39;s. The younger of the two 
wrapped her arms around Yoruichi&#39;s neck, who was only too happy to pull 
her closer at the waist, savoring the contours of her hips and the smell 
and taste of her that left her in that indescribeable haze of bliss. 
Yoruichi had the strongest urge to whimper but decided that such a 
girlish noise of euphoria would seem strange coming out of her-- though 
the constant massaging of her scalp by those slender fingers made her 
decision a difficult one to keep.

Suddenly Soi withdrew, planting a lighter peck on Yoruichi&#39;s lips like 
it was her trademark, making the senior realize that she was STILL 
blushing-- but at least, so was Soi.

&quot;...I&#39;ll get the movie going, okay?&quot;

Yoruichi felt a stupid sort of ecstacy wash over her as Soi gave her a 
wink and walked into the living room, like the stomachaches she&#39;d had 
before but this time it almost made her want to sing, to run after Soi 
and just smother her with kisses for the rest of her life. The whole 
thing, of being in a relationship with Soi-- it was all so different 
from what she&#39;d known before, and made her FEEL different than she ever 
had. No freedom she&#39;d believed she possessed could ever equal this, the 
warmth and security and the absolute contentment that only Soi seemed to 
give her.

But then her thoughts drifted back to what Kuukaku had said. What was it 
she wanted to do? She wanted to be with Soi, but...somehow, this trip 
just seemed to stay on her mind. She&#39;d wanted this for so long, but 
would Soi understand? Could she leave her after all this? And what about 
Kisuke? She&#39;d tried calling twice already today, but hadn&#39;t recieved an 
answer from anywhere he could be. She at least wanted to be on good 
terms with him when she left.

&quot;Yoruichi, are you ready?&quot; Soi called suddenly from the living room 
couch, where the light of the television had already started blinking 
away.

&quot;Uh,&quot; the senior managed, shaking herself out of a trance, &quot;...Yeah, 
I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;

----------

&quot;So,&quot; Yoruichi asked suddenly as the movie continued, Soi adjusting 
herself slightly in her embrace, &quot;...When did you know?&quot;

&quot;Know what?&quot;

&quot;Well, that you...liked me,&quot; the dark-skinned woman said quietly into 
the back of her neck. Soi was quiet for a moment before answering, 
humming as she searched her memory.

&quot;Um...Well, I guess it was when we all went to the beach over the 
summer. Do you remember the festival at all?&quot;

&quot;Hmph. I remember waking up the day after with a hangover,&quot; Yoruichi 
grumbled.

&quot;well, you WERE drunk... and I was in the woods, don&#39;t ask me why 
though... And then I found you, and you...kissed me.&quot;

&quot;...I WHAT?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Soi responded, holding down a laugh at Yoruichi&#39;s shocked and 
disbelieving reaction. &quot;Pinned me to the nearest tree and just kissed me 
for about a minute. It was getting to the point where I couldn&#39;t 
breathe-- and quite frankly, you&#39;re not a great kisser when you&#39;re 
blitzed.&quot;

&quot;Oh, jeez... I can&#39;t believe I did something so stupid. NOT kissing 
YOU,&quot; Yoruichi corrected when Soi cast a teasing look of accusation at 
her. &quot;I just mean... Ah, nevermind.&quot; Soi smiled as the senior rubbed her 
eyes in embarassment. Though it WAS a mistake, it had ultimately led her 
to this-- to being with her, to a new sense of who she was in relation 
to the world. It had been sloppy and forceful and Yoruichi had reeked of 
sake but she wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything in the world.

&quot;Okay, okay... and what about YOU, Yoruichi? When did you fall for 
little ol&#39; me?&quot; the Chinese girl asked in a sarcastic attempt at 
coyness.

&quot;...Um... I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;...You don&#39;t know?&quot; Soi responded with a bit of indignance in her 
voice.

&quot;Well, I just mean...there wasn&#39;t really a moment when it happened. I 
just... I guess if you NEED an answer, it would have to be the first day 
I met you.&quot;

&quot;R-really? You&#39;re just saying that,&quot; the girl dismissed skeptically.

&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong-- it wasn&#39;t anything like &#39;love at first sight&#39; or 
something that silly... I was just... It was something about your 
additude. Not caring whether you got beat up or not, or if someone 
helped you. I guess... I kinda saw a lot of myself in you. But you were 
a lot sweeter of a kid then I EVER was,&quot; Yoruichi said with a smile as 
she leaned forward to peck her lover on the forehead, her grip on her 
shoulder tightening just a little.

&quot;...Yoruichi?&quot; the Chinese girl said without warning.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; The upperclassman loosened her grip as Soi leaned up and put 
slender lips to her ear, whispering a trio of words that rang in 
Yoruichi&#39;s head, despite the gentleness with which they were conveyed. 
The love with which Soi had muttered her declaration, as well as the 
gentle kiss left on her neck as she curled into her arms, sent Yoruichi 
reeling for about a minute, her heart orbiting the moon and then gliding 
blissfully back again. She felt disarmed, exposed with the freshman, but 
as she squeezed the tiny body in her lap closer she was aware that she 
didn&#39;t feel nervous or guilty at all.

Just happy.

&quot;...I&#39;m going to miss you...when you&#39;re gone, Yoruichi,&quot; Soi said in as 
quiet a tone, but this time her voice quavered slightly as if she was 
holding something back. It only took Yoruichi a moment-- for all her 
earlier indecision and doubt-- to make a decision.

&quot;I&#39;m not going.&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi asked in obvious confusion, pushing up slightly to meet 
Yoruichi&#39;s smoldering gaze.

&quot;Soi...I&#39;m not going anywhere. I want to stay...with you.&quot;</pre>
