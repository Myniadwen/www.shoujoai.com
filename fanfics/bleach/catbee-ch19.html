Soi breathed a sigh of contentment as she climbed out of the shower, 
hanging her brand-new swimsuit (a black one-piece with a yellow stripe 
running down the right side) over the glass door as she wrapped a towel 
around herself. She couldn&#39;t believe how quickly the last few days had 
gone--she&#39;d been enjoying Yoruichi&#39;s company so much that everything 
else seemed almost irrelevant.

I wish we weren&#39;t leaving tomorrow, she thought sadly as she headed to 
her temporary room. But they were going to try to squeeze a couple more 
hours of swimming in before they left-- that meant... The image of 
Yoruichi in her bikini appeared unheeded in Soi&#39;s mind for about the 
hundredth time, but for once she did nothing to reject the memory. It 
had appeared so often over the last week in her mind&#39;s eye that she was 
slowly beginning to feel less adverse to it, almost welcoming it when it 
did happen upon her.

Soi closed her eyes slowly, feeling something strange happening to her 
as the thought lingered-- it was almost like she was wandering through a 
fog, waiting for that little voice that constantly berated her for 
thinking such things to scare some sense into her. She couldn&#39;t hear it 
this time, though-- instead there was a sweeter, gentler, almost 
seductive urging that told her that this was good, that told her not to 
fight, that was making her want to do things to herself that she&#39;d never 
even considered doing before...

She wasn&#39;t aware of just how far her hand had gone down her waist until 
she heard a light knock on the door behind her. Soi snapped back to 
reality as though she&#39;d been waiting for it, then pulled her towel back 
on as Yoruichi let herself in.

&quot;Hey, Soi! What&#39;cha d--&quot;

&quot;C-could I get a little privacy!&quot; Soi yelled rather hysterically as she 
hugged the cloth to herself, the intensity of her actions making 
Yoruichi&#39;s eyes widen slightly in surprise. &quot;...S-sorry,&quot; Soi muttered 
in shame once she realized what she had just done, her face burning 
brighter when the reality of what she had been interrupted from hit her 
full-on.

Oh, Jesus...Was I just...?

&quot;Uh...hey, no problem,&quot; Yoruichi answered, shrugging off her friend&#39;s 
strange temprament as though it was nothing. She then tossed something 
onto Soi&#39;s bed; the freshman looked closer at the folded-up package and 
saw the hem of what looked like a silk robe. &quot;...I just wanted to give 
you this.&quot; Still being careful to hold the towel up with one hand, Soi 
tore off the brown paper packaging and grabbed the neck of the outfit, 
unfolding it to reveal a silver yukata with a gold floral trim. Soi 
stared at the beautiful robe in surprise, speechless for a moment, then 
finally remembered that Yoruichi was standing there and decided to speak 
up.

&quot;W-Why are you giving this to me?&quot; Soi asked uncertainly.

&quot;Well,&quot; Yoruichi began as she stepped further into the room, allowing 
Soi a glimpse of the small stack of similarly-packaged robes in her 
right arm, &quot;...I was in town with Kisuke today (Soi felt herself bristle 
up at the mention that Urahara had been alone with Yoruichi, but it 
disappeared almost as soon as it had happened), and some of the locals 
were talking about a festival that&#39;s planned for tonight!&quot;

&quot;R...Really?&quot; Soi asked as her eyes widened, an uncharacteristic bit of 
childlike glee sneaking through the cracks of her mature facade. &quot;What 
holiday is it for?&quot;

&quot;...Dunno,&quot; Yoruichi shrugged, unabashed in her lack of knowledge on the 
issue. &quot;All I know is that there&#39;ll be plenty of good food there. I 
haven&#39;t had the chance to go to one in a few years, so there&#39;s no way 
we&#39;re missing this!&quot;

&quot;Does everyone else know about this?&quot;

&quot;Heh-- soon enough, they will,&quot; Yoruichi answered with a grin as she 
left the room, leaving a Soi Fong alone with her thoughts again.

&quot;For God&#39;s sake, kid-- just leave the damn obi alone,&quot; Kuukaku said 
irritably as the freshman adjusted the sash of her yukata for the 
eleventh time. The brash upperclassman was situated between Soi and 
Yoruichi (much to Soi&#39;s silent displeasure), dressed in a tight-fitting 
t-shirt and jeans on the basis that she &#39;didn&#39;t wanna wear that flowery 
crap&#39; to the festival. Everyone else was at least willing to get into 
the spirit of the event-- Kisuke and the other boys had found some 
loose-fitting robes of their own with plain designs and simple colors, 
while even Nanao was adorned in a rather elegant golden one offset with 
white-stitched lilies. Soi, however, felt like even more of a sore thumb 
than she had before.

&quot;Sorry, Shiba-san,&quot; the youngest of the group muttered with a 
combination of irritation and embarrassment as she tried to hike up the 
quickly-dirtying hem of her silver yukata. &quot;...It&#39;s not my fault that 
this thing&#39;s too big.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi apologized as she picked up her pace 
just enough to get her friend in sight. &quot;...They were out of your size, 
so I just got the next biggest size. I hope that&#39;s okay...&quot; Soi blinked, 
almost stared as she looked at Yoruichi and remembered why she had put 
distance between herself and the upperclassman. The older girl looked 
even more beautiful than before, adorned in a robe of shimmering 
lavender with overlapping designs of wildflowers stitched into the 
fabric and her hair tied back into a bun held in place with an 
elaborately carved hairpiece of striking topaz, the same color as those 
warm, hypnotic eyes...

&quot;...Soi?&quot; The girl&#39;s eyes widened when she realized she&#39;d been staring, 
then had to think quickly so she wouldn&#39;t be found at a loss for words.

&quot;Oh, uh, no...It&#39;s okay...&quot; Soi breathed a sigh of relief as she looked 
away from the group, grateful that the low light of the nearby lanterns 
was insufficient to make the blush on her face visible. The others began 
talking amongst themselves the deeper in they went among the variety of 
stands and booths, all of them debating where to go and what to do 
first. Soi was only half-listening to their chatter, she was trying to 
pretend that she was interested in the nearby goldfish-catching games 
and not in her sempai&#39;s elegant profile, her mouth curled up in a smile 
as she teased Urahara about something that made everyone else in the 
group laugh as well. Soi wished that she could have heard it, that she 
could have been just a little closer so as to share in Yoruichi&#39;s 
laughter--

&quot;H-hey!&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi muttered as she turned to the voice&#39;s source and found 
Isane doubled over behind her, looking out of breath from running and 
hastily dressed in a kimono that looked almost second-hand, but was 
still a vibrant shade of aquamarine. That was when Soi remembered that 
she hadn&#39;t noticed the short-haired girl leave with them a half-hour 
ago. &quot;Hey, where were you, Kotetsu-san?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, what happened?&quot; Rangiku asked since the group had just noticed 
her and were forming a semi-circle around the girl, worriedly asking her 
if she needed to rest or other such things.

&quot;W...well, I...I was just...shopping for dinner, like Yoruichi-san asked 
me to...and when I got...back, no one was there... I can&#39;t believe I 
almost missed this!&quot; the silver-haired girl finished with a look of 
excitement as she indicated the lively chaos of the festival.

&quot;Wait...&quot; Shunsui began as he absentmindedly ran a thumb over his uneven 
stubble, &quot;...Didn&#39;t Yoruichi call you while you were gone? About what we 
were doing tonight?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Isane answered with a confused shrug. &quot;...I didn&#39;t have any 
messages, either-- I left my cell phone on the whole time I was gone.&quot; 
Soi Fong had a sudden inclination to turn to Yoruichi, who unfortunately 
seemed to be avoiding any eye contact with Isane, almost as though she 
had something to hide. &quot;...Oh,&quot; the Junior said without warning as she 
turned to Yoruichi&#39;s best friend. &quot;...Thanks for that note you left, 
Urahara! I wouldn&#39;t have known about this without you!&quot;

&quot;Oh, REALLY?&quot; Yoruichi said with a wide smile plastered on her face, 
turning to the blonde boy and giving him a congratulatory pat on the 
shoulder. &quot;...Good job, Kisuke...Oh, and I&#39;m sorry I forgot to call you, 
Isane.&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s no problem-- everyone makes mistakes,&quot; the girl said with a 
laugh, not noticing as Soi did the almost rigid undertone of the older 
girl&#39;s &#39;apology.&#39;

That&#39;s weird, the freshman thought quietly as she watched Yoruichi&#39;s 
seemingly earnest request for forgiveness. Why would she not have wanted 
Isane here?

&quot;So,&quot; the Kotetsu girl said as she turned to Soi, seemingly forgetting 
the others in an instant, &quot;...I s-saw you looking over t-there (Isane 
cursed the stutter playing on her lips again), and I w-was wondering...&quot;

&quot;...Wondering WHAT?&quot; Yoruichi interjected even as she wondered where the 
slight hint of bitterness in her voice had come from and why it was 
there at all. She noticed everyone else looking at her a little oddly, 
but the dark girl stood her ground, not wanting to look repentant.

&quot;W-well...S-Soi Fong,&quot; Isane said with a nervous smile, turning as far 
away from Yoruichi&#39;s scrutiny as she could, &quot;...Do you wanna go check 
out the g-games?&quot;

&quot;No-- see, we were going to try to stick together, since it&#39;s crowded 
and all...&quot; Yoruichi began, but she was interrupted by none other than 
Kisuke.

&quot;Yoruichi, come on-- they&#39;re not children, and Isane&#39;s nearly 
eighteen... I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ll be okay on their own.&quot;

&quot;But--&quot;

&quot;Yeah, come on, Yoruichi,&quot; Ukitake smiled at her almost jokingly. 
&quot;...You&#39;re not her mother, you know.&quot;

Yoruichi knew that he was just kidding, that he hadn&#39;t meant anything by 
it and that she would probably have laughed if it were about anyone 
else, but all of a sudden she had the strongest desire to hit the 
platinum-haired boy right in the face and tell him that if he ever made 
any jokes about Soi&#39;s family again she&#39;d beat his brains out, but the 
hearty laughter of everyone around her and shock at the visceral 
brutality of her thoughts stayed her hand. Besides, Ukitake was her 
friend...but it had been so easy to forget that less than a second 
ago...

&quot;Well, how about this,&quot; Rangiku asked as she kept Gin on the short leash 
that was her arm, &quot;...You two go do what you want, and the rest of us&#39;ll 
meet you at the okonomiyaki stand in a hour-and-a-half, okay?&quot; She asked 
the question with an oddly suggestive smile, the significance of her 
implication lost on Soi Fong but not on her dark-skinned sempai.

&quot;O-okay...&quot; Soi answered noncomittally, as she hadn&#39;t really wanted to 
go play games but seemed to be having the choice made for her anyway. 
Before she knew it, Isane had grabbed her by the wrist and was leading 
her away from the group, from Yoruichi, but she simply gave a 
disappointed sigh and went along with the other girl.

...I guess it could be fun, she forced herself to think they came to a 
stop at a turtle-catching booth. She glanced over her shoulder where 
Yoruichi had been just a second ago, hoping to ditch Isane and go back, 
but since the others seemed to want to hang out together she let the 
thought go. She didn&#39;t want Yoruichi to feel like she was a burden, 
after all.

The gaggle of upperclassman waved their farewells before heading off in 
the opposite direction.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that cute?&quot; Matsumoto squealed to her disinterested boyfriend as 
they went by a shooting booth that had stuffed animals for prizes.

&quot;Eh? Y&#39;mean th&#39; lion thing?&quot; he asked vaguely as he pointed to a yellow, 
anthropomorphic stuffed toy with beady black eyes.

&quot;Not THAT,&quot; she said while giving teh slit-eyed boy a teasing roll of 
the eyes. &quot;...I meant Isane-kun and Soi Fong!&quot;

&quot;...Oh. Eh,&quot; Ichimaru shrugged the observation off, as such things 
weren&#39;t really what held his interest.

&quot;I mean, did you see Isane&#39;s face? I haven&#39;t seen her like that in a 
LONG time,&quot; Rangiku said as she wore a mischevious smile on her visage. 
&quot;And Soi&#39;s such a sweet girl...&quot;

&quot;I always knew she was like THAT,&quot; Kuukaku muttered with a raised 
eyebrow and a smirk, &quot;...But I dunno about th&#39; kid...&quot;

&quot;Well, hey,&quot; Ukitake said after a few moments, &quot;...We should encourage 
them! You know, try and give them more time to be...alone together. 
They&#39;d make a really cute couple...&quot;

Suddenly Kisuke cringed as he felt an all-too familiar hand make contact 
with the back of his head, but unlike the teasing slaps Yoruichi would 
normally take at him this one felt like she was trying to decapitate 
him. It was only the fact that he was used to being hit there so many 
times that he was able to keep from screaming out loud in pain. He 
turned around sharply to see Yoruichi within arm&#39;s length, giving him 
the deadliest of glares.

&quot;Hey! What was THAT for?&quot; the blonde boy asked a little more harshly 
then he had meant to. Yoruichi levelled her death glare at him a little 
longer before looking away and muttering &quot;Nothing.&quot;

...He just HAD to leave that note, didn&#39;t he?</pre>
