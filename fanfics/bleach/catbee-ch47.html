Yoruichi didn&#39;t give Soi anytime to think, to process what she&#39;d just 
declared. She simply pulled the girl&#39;s face towards hers, lightning 
running through her veins as she wrapped her lips around the Chinese 
girl&#39;s. Like last time she felt the overwhelming dizziness, the growing 
desire, but this time she made no attempt to subdue it, attribute it to 
something else. She pulled Soi even closer as she felt her lips 
wandering, coming to rest on the curve of that pale neck.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi...&quot;

Soi struggled, her thoughts uncertain. This was all she had ever wanted, 
for Yoruichi to see her and want her like this. She should have been 
happy. She should&#39;ve been savoring this, returning her affection instead 
of just standing rooted in place like a tree. But as the older girl 
continued her fevered, ecstatic exploration of her, Soi felt her 
confusion die down, replaced by anger.

&quot;...YORUICHI, STOP IT!&quot;

It took a moment for the senior to hear the words, since the first thing 
that actually broke Yoruichi&#39;s trance was the sudden jolt of force, of 
hands pushing her back into the door. There was an absolute halt of time 
as they stood frozen, Soi realizing what she&#39;d done and Yoruichi trying 
to comprehend what was going on. It took the older girl a moment to find 
her voice.

&quot;...Soi...Why are--&quot;

&quot;Why am I WHAT, Yoruichi?&quot; The older girl bit her lip, the venom in the 
other&#39;s tone deadlier than she&#39;d expected. Soi had turned to look at the 
wall, no visible anger on her face, as if she was trying to hold it in 
even now. &quot;...What is it that I&#39;m doing...that&#39;s SUCH a shock that you 
can&#39;t even say it out loud?&quot;

Yoruichi opened her mouth, but unlike so many times before no words came 
to her. She had expected perhaps a little resistance, maybe some 
tears...but not this degree of subdued fury.

&quot;Do you really think that little of me? That as soon as you get tired of 
Urahara, I&#39;m supposed to be HAPPY when you decide to show up? That 
because YOU feel this way now that I&#39;m supposed to say, &#39;Oh, 
Yoruichi-san! Of course I&#39;ll take you back! I&#39;m just a stupid little 
girl who doesn&#39;t have a single shred of integrity or... or autonomy or 
anything like that!&#39; IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK I AM, YORUICHI? YOUR LITTLE 
FUCKING PET?!&quot;

Soi wasn&#39;t holding anything back now as she advanced on Yoruichi, save 
for the slight dampness on the brim of her eyelids, which only served to 
make the fire of her steel irises harder to take. Yoruichi knew she 
deserved this, that she&#39;d been foolish to think that Soi would 
capitulate to her so easily, but even so she reached out a hand, running 
her fingers gently along Soi&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Soi, wait...&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T TOUCH ME!&quot; the freshman screamed as she knocked the hand away, a 
look of slight guilt there for a moment before she turned away again, 
though this time her profile was still visible. Yoruichi reluctantly 
pulled back, biting her lip as she struggled to put her thoughts into 
words.

&quot;...I know that I hurt you, Soi. And I&#39;m sorry, but... do you really 
think this is easy for me? Do you think that I just...say this to 
anyone? I wanted to be with you for so long, but... I just got so scared 
that I...&quot;

&quot;Since when are you afraid of anything?&quot; Yoruichi idled, not answering 
the rather dark question.

&quot;...Soi...&quot; she whispered, drawing close to the girl, so close that she 
wanted to hold her again, but her hands didn&#39;t move. She didn&#39;t trust 
them to keep it so simple. &quot;...I really do love you, and... I wanna be 
with you. I&#39;ve never...ever felt this way about anyone. And...you love 
me too, I KNOW you do.&quot;

She felt a little rush of hope at the softening of Soi&#39;s eyes, a brief 
glimpse of the look she&#39;d always given her before. When Soi opened her 
mouth, her voice was hard, but laced with a tremble that betrayed what 
her face did not.

&quot;Of course I do. Yoruichi...I always loved you. But... but you never... 
bothered to...&quot; Soi held back a sniffle, aching to simply burst into 
tears and go back into Yoruichi&#39;s arms, now that she knew she&#39;d be 
welcome there. But she couldn&#39;t let Yoruichi think she&#39;d simply continue 
to be pushed over or used like that. She wanted to hurt Yoruichi, wanted 
to make her understand exactly how she&#39;d felt the moment she&#39;d walked in 
on her with her arms around Kisuke. The Chinese girl let out a sigh as 
she backed away slightly from Yoruichi. &quot;I&#39;m tired, Yoruichi-- tired of 
all this time of lying and hiding and all these bullshit excuses-- that 
we&#39;ve BOTH used, and I--&quot; After a deep breath, Soi shook her head in the 
direction of the front door, her voice little more than a broken 
tremble. &quot;...I want you to leave.&quot;

&quot;Soi...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious, Yoruichi. Go and don&#39;t come back.&quot;

The upperclassman froze, the words tearing into her, giving her the 
strange feeling that this was a dream. It had to be. Soi wouldn&#39;t do 
that to her. Not now.

&quot;...I can&#39;t.&quot; She grabbed Soi, held her again, sliding her hands along 
that small face, the curve of her shoulder, the indescernable dip of her 
stomach. &quot;Soi, I just...&quot; Unable to bear any more, she slid a hand 
behind Soi&#39;s head, pulling her lips close once again, but again Soi 
broke the embrace.

&quot;I&#39;M NOT GOING TO LET YOU LIE TO ME AGAIN!&quot; When Yoruichi didn&#39;t move, 
Soi pushed her back, and when the older girl advanced again Soi did the 
only thing her disheveled senses could consider, and ran. She let her 
feet carry her into the kitchen, Yoruichi close behind, but before the 
senior could catch up Soi threw herself into the bathroom, locking it 
shut behind her.

&quot;Soi, open this door!&quot; Yoruichi yelled as she fought with the brass 
knob, which shuddered defiantly in her hand.

&quot;SOI, I&#39;M SORRY! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!&quot;

When no response came she pulled harder, feeling it creak from her 
strength but retain its shape, refusing to give.

&quot;DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP BEING FRIENDS WITH KISUKE?! DO YOU WANT ME TO 
STAY HERE?! TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT AND I&#39;LL DO IT, JUST PLEASE OPEN THE 
DOOR AND TALK TO ME!&quot; Yoruichi wasn&#39;t aware of how weak her voice had 
become as she abandoned pretense and began pounding on the door, at 
first with violent desperation that quickly dwindled into halfheartedly 
slamming her fist against the wood. She was suddenly aware that it was 
hard to breathe, that she felt like her heart might explode in her 
chest, her voice hoarse and strangled.

&quot;...Please... don&#39;t shut me out.&quot; Finally, the lack of any noise but an 
echo seeping through the crack of the door sunk into Yoruichi&#39;s brain, 
and all at once her strength left her, her body become too heavy for 
her; she felt gravity drag her to the floor, her hands sliding uselessly 
along the woodwork, dipping automatically with the simple design carved 
into the door. She could&#39;ve broken it with a single kick, sent it flying 
into a cloud of splinters. At the moment, it might as well have been 
made of steel.

The sensation that her lungs were working overtime hit Yoruichi again as 
she leaned her head pathetically against the door. Inside her chest, her 
heart felt like it was being ripped out, slowly and torturously. And 
somehow it hit her, in that moment, that it really was over. She 
expected to burst into tears, but all she felt was numb; the place at 
the center of her chest aching but shriveling up, disappearing.

Yoruichi tried to remember why she had done this, why she&#39;d broken 
Kisuke&#39;s heart and her own heart and Soi&#39;s heart for all this.

And then she remembered. For her pride. Because she had wanted to be 
strong. Hadn&#39;t wanted to depend on, or need anyone.

The girl felt herself laugh bitterly, the sound forced. What had her 
pride ever done for her, but get her into trouble? What had her strength 
ever gotten her, save for making her build walls around herself?

She&#39;d hurt the only people she ever loved, ever cared about, because it 
had been too difficult to just be honest with herself.

&quot;...Please...&quot;

Yoruichi was aware, if distantly, of her body sliding to the floor 
completely, lying on the cool linoleum of the kitchen. She vaguely 
remembered promising herself that she&#39;d stay here until Soi came out, 
but the strain of breathing and the dead weight in her chest overwhelmed 
her, and she drifted into a daze. Inside, Soi sat on the floor, her head 
between her knees as she curled up a little tighter, uncertain of what 
to do.

----------

The upperclassman wasn&#39;t sure how many hours had passed, how long her 
mind had been drifting when she suddenly became aware of wood bumping 
into her head. Instinctively Yoruichi forced herself up, an ache 
returning in her heart as she looked to find Soi, half between leaving 
the bathroom and staying, her eyes soft and her face passive. For a 
minute neither of them moved. Yoruichi opened her mouth, wanted to say 
something. Anything. But suddenly she found her face in Soi&#39;s shoulder, 
slender arms wrapped around her neck, the girl&#39;s chin resting on her 
collarbone.

&quot;Soi, I--&quot;

&quot;...I know. I know you do, Yoruichi,&quot; Soi admitted as she squeezed the 
older girl tighter to herself. She had tried so hard to believe that she 
could be rid of Yoruichi, that she no longer maintained that hold on her 
being. But hating Yoruichi-- for real-- was simply something she 
couldn&#39;t do. She&#39;d never stopped loving her, but the hurt had blinded 
her, made her forget. And no matter what Yoruichi did she couldn&#39;t bear 
to hold it against her, not when the look in her eyes now was so far 
from the teasing and condescending twinkle that had been there before.

&quot;Yoruichi...&quot; the girl whispered as she ran a hand gently through the 
long strands of the senior&#39;s hair, a smile barely on her lips as 
familiar words passed from them, &quot;...You don&#39;t have to be so strong all 
the time.&quot;

And then something in Yoruichi snapped. She felt a little startled as 
her voice collapsed into an odd stammering of sobs, tiny wet drops of 
salt water sliding unheeded from topaz eyes and onto Soi&#39;s shirt. Her 
hands grabbed at the cloth, bunching it up between her fingers on the 
girl&#39;s back as Yoruichi wept. Unfamiliar with the act, Yoruichi only 
held Soi tighter as the tears flooded out of her now, refusing to halt 
in the slightest. She felt like a little girl-- small and helpless and 
weak-- as Soi held her and knew that she must look pathetic, pouring her 
soul out as everything she&#39;d kept buried down over the course of her 
life seemed to well up in her at once, but she didn&#39;t care.

Yoruichi felt, finally, like she&#39;d regained a piece of herself, one that 
Soi had stolen away, or rather one that had been absent for her whole 
life but that only this girl had made her aware was missing. And though 
neither of them spoke through Yoruichi&#39;s catharsis she knew that Soi, 
gently continuing to hold her, felt the same.

----------

Zhou sighed as he stumbled into the house, fatigue temporarily rendering 
him unaware of his surroundings. Atleast they&#39;d be ready for court on 
time, he thought grimly as he considered the lazy partner he&#39;d been 
assigned to. He slipped his shoes off at the door, thinking about how 
much carpooling was killing him, then set his coat leisurely on the hook 
by the front door.

&quot;Soi-chan? Are you still awake?&quot; He knew he shouldn&#39;t have expected a 
response this late at night, but he supposed it couldn&#39;t hurt to check. 
Sure enough, he walked into the living room, squinting in the darkness 
to find the TV off, and...

He almost gasped, more from surprise than anything else, as what was 
laying on the couch came into focus. There was Soi, and nestled behind 
her was Yoruichi, arms wrapped around her thin waist, Soi&#39;s back to her 
and the older girl&#39;s head leaning gently on his daughter&#39;s pale neck.

For a moment he stood there; he knew he said he&#39;d been all right with 
this knowledge, of who Soi had decided she was, but somehow, seeing 
this-- and with the girl who&#39;d broken her heart, no less-- made him more 
than a little uncomfortable. It wasn&#39;t as though he&#39;d walked in on them 
naked, but somehow this seemed no less inappropriate, like he was 
standing in on an intimate moment. He wanted to say something, wanted to 
wake them up, wanted to tell Soi that it wasn&#39;t right for her to throw 
herself back to this other girl.

But as he leaned forward the floorboards creaked slightly under him, and 
the sound registered with Yoruichi, who wound her arms a little tighter 
around Soi in her sleep, a few tears escaping her closed eyes. Zhou 
wasn&#39;t sure how long he stayed in place, eyes glued to the dark hands 
gripping Soi, protectively and yet helplessly, and then at his 
daughter&#39;s strange expression of peace, of absolute contentment.

He said nothing as he walked away, coming back a few minutes later to 
drape a thin blanket over the girls, a sad smile crossing his lips as 
Soi snuggled closer to the sleeping form behind her, unable to shake the 
feeling that she was no longer just his little Soi-chan anymore. He laid 
the slightest peck on her cheek, then walked to his room, wiping away 
the single tear that threatened to betray his feelings.</pre>
