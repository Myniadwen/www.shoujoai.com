Soi had to admit to herself that she was a little nervous when they 
arrived at the front doorstep. Yoruichi hadn&#39;t said anything since they 
had turned down her street and the houses were becoming progressively 
more neglected as they walked, almost like watching an animal die 
frame-by-frame. She remained silent as the smaller girl slid her key 
into the lock, turning it until it clicked open, then pushed the door 
inside.

&quot;...Well, like I said, it&#39;s nothing special...&quot; Soi muttered 
apologetically as the upperclassman stepped inside, the floorboards 
creaking slightly underneath her feet. Yoruichi slipped her shoes off 
following Soi Fong&#39;s lead, then turned her face towards the freshman. 
Instead of looking disgusted at the Fong family&#39;s near poverty, Yoruichi 
had a wide smile on.

&quot;Are you kidding! I love it!&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi blinked, this reaction far from what she had anticipated. 
Yoruichi stepped out of the small drop-off where they had left their 
shoes and walked casually to the staircase, running a hand along the 
nicked railing.

&quot;I can&#39;t see why you&#39;re embarrassed about living here-- it&#39;s so...cozy, 
you know? It kinda gives you that warm, nostalgic feeling.&quot; Soi Fong 
turned defensive once she realized what Yoruichi had said.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t feel embarrassed! I-I like it here!&quot;

&quot;...Then why were you so insistent on me not coming? Or even Kisuke for 
that matter?&quot; the older girl countered with a slightly cocked eyebrow. 
The Chinese girl opened her mouth, but quickly shut it again once she 
realized she didn&#39;t really have an answer to the question. &quot;...Did you 
think that it would be &#39;below my dignity?&#39;&quot; Yoruichi added with a wry 
grin, and Soi, embarrassed, turned in the other direction, knowing that 
Yoruichi had once again seen through her like a glass window.

&quot;...I-I&#39;m sor--&quot; she began, but the upperclassman waved the feeble 
apology off.

&quot;Don&#39;t be. It&#39;s only natural for you to have some assumptions about me-- 
we don&#39;t know each other very well yet. Let&#39;s just forget it, all 
right?&quot; Soi Fong stared at the girl quietly for a moment before she 
nodded in agreement. It was rather pleasant to see that instead of just 
being some airheaded tomboy, her savior was in fact wise beyond her 
years. &quot;...Hey, what&#39;s this?&quot; Yoruichi had walked over to a small chest 
of drawers on the wall beside the stairs that was covered in photos and 
homemade crafts. She carefully picked up a little object composed of 
glue and popsicle sticks, painted haphazardly the way only a 
kindergartener can. &quot;Did you make this?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Soi hummed as she waited for memory to provide a decent answer. 
&quot;...Yeah, I made that when I was five-- for my mom.&quot; She blushed 
slightly as she looked at the &#39;sculpture&#39; she had been so proud of those 
many years ago and now in hindsight only looked like an eyesore. &quot;It&#39;s 
pretty crappy, I know, but...&quot; Yoruichi didn&#39;t think there was anything 
wrong with it at all, but decided to say nothing regarding the sculpture 
and changed the subject by picking up a framed picture showing two 
adults and a little girl.

&quot;Is this your mom?&quot; the tall girl asked as she turned the picture so 
that Soi could confirm her suspicion with a nod.

&quot;...Yeah.&quot; she said after a moment. Yoruichi looked at the tiny girl 
struggling to escape the protective embrace of a stunning woman with 
perfectly straight, flowing black hair and a warm smile.

&quot;She&#39;s beautiful,&quot; The dark woman said quietly. &quot;Where is sh--&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go into the living room,&quot; Soi interrupted and led the way into 
the next part of the house, her reaction telling Yoruichi more than 
words could. As such, she never mentioned the photograph, or Soi&#39;s 
mother, again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; a man&#39;s voice rang warmly through the worn corridors of the 
small house to be greeted by Soi Fong&#39;s voice from the kitchen.

&quot;Hi Dad! I&#39;m in here!&quot; Her father smiled to himself as he took off his 
suitcoat and hung it on the closet doorknob and set his shoes beside the 
front door. He turned left in the voice&#39;s direction and was swiftly 
greeted with a hug from a short girl with long braids.

&quot;Hello, honey! How was sch--&quot; He stopped speaking when he caught sight 
of the tall girl sitting casually at the small kitchen table, smiling in 
his direction. &quot;...Soi Fong, who&#39;s this? Are the bill collectors sending 
kids to do their dirty work now?&quot; He chuckled at his own joke, but Soi&#39;s 
eyes narrowed slightly at the mention of a subject that she didn&#39;t find 
even slightly amusing. Her frown faded immediately, however, since she 
couldn&#39;t stay angry at her father for very long even if it was only in 
jest.

&quot;Oh, sorry...Dad, this Yoruichi-san, she goes to my school. 
Yoruichi-san, this is my father.&quot; Yoruichi bowed respectfully to the 
older man, a surprisingly formal action that nearly made Soi giggle, but 
she succeeded in hiding it behind a cough.

&quot;It&#39;s very nice to meet you, Mr. Fong,&quot; she said politely.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s nice to meet you as well, young lady. Are you one of Soi&#39;s 
friends?&quot; Yoruichi was silent for a moment as she considered his query, 
then smiled warmly in the other girl&#39;s direction.

&quot;...Yeah, I guess I am.&quot; Soi Fong&#39;s face turned a very light shade of 
pink at Yoruichi&#39;s statement. The idea that, of all people, a popular 
upperclassman like her would consider Soi as something other than just 
another faceless freshman seemed unreal. &quot;Well,&quot; the tall girl said as 
she brushed a few stray hairs out of her face, &quot;...It&#39;s getting late--I 
better get home.&quot;

As she watched Yoruichi walk to the door, Soi Fong felt a strange desire 
to ask her to stay longer. She&#39;d been here nearly an hour, and they 
weren&#39;t actually doing anything, and Soi didn&#39;t want to inconvenience 
someone who&#39;d be getting ready for college exams soon, but her mouth was 
half open when her father suddenly cut her off.

&quot;Hey, wait! Why not stay for dinner? I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re probably hungry...&quot; 
Yoruichi hesitated, as she was in fact VERY hungry, but she only held up 
a hand in mild protest.

&quot;Oh, no--I couldn&#39;t impose, and I&#39;m sure you guys want a nice quiet 
dinner to yourselves...&quot;

&quot;Come on now,&quot; the middle-aged man protested. &quot;I won&#39;t take &#39;no&#39; for an 
answer. I never get to meet my Soi Fong&#39;s friends and this would be a 
nice opportunity.&quot; The upperclassman was about to refuse again, but 
after a few moments spent in quiet contemplation, she stepped away from 
the front door.

&quot;...You know what? I&#39;d like that...If it&#39;s really not too much trouble.&quot;

Soi Fong managed to fight down the strange urge to jump for joy, and 
contented herself with only a slight smile.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately for Yoruichi, Soi&#39;s father had no idea how to cook, a fact 
that became evident when he somehow succeeded in actually setting the 
noodles he was making on fire. Once the smoke cleared and the 
long-haired upperclassman managed to stop laughing, he reluctantly dug 
in the cabinet and pulled out the phone book, finally stopping at a 
number for local pizza delivery place.

&quot;It&#39;ll probably take about half an hour,&quot; the graying man said with a 
sigh after he put the telephone back on its stand. &quot;So, Yoruichi-chan... 
(the dark girl flinched at being referred to as &#39;chan&#39; but did nothing) 
...How did you meet Soi Fong? She never mentioned you before...&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh... Well, she showed up at the Karate club one week and she&#39;s 
been going ever since.&quot;

Soi blinked at how quickly Yoruichi had fabricated these alternate 
circumstances of their first meeting; it was almost as if she had 
anticipated the question from the start.

&quot;Really? Soi Fong in Karate?&quot; he responded with an impressed look on his 
face, then turned to look at his daughter sitting at the other end of 
the table. &quot;...I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d taken an interest in sports.&quot; Soi 
turned red from the exacting stare her father was giving her, but 
managed a &#39;yes&#39; that satisfied him.

&quot;Oh, she&#39;s great!&quot; Yoruichi continued, eager now that she knew her story 
had been believed. &quot;Most kids her age aren&#39;t as eager to stay with the 
program just because it starts so slow, but she&#39;s been sticking with it 
the whole time!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Soi&#39;s always been the patient type,&quot; her father said with an 
appraising smile. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find she&#39;s a very dedicated person.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure she is,&quot; Yoruichi said with a nod. With that, the conversation 
effectively died, leaving an uncomfortable silence in its wake.

&quot;...You know,&quot; the patriarch said without warning, startling the two 
girls, &quot;...I have to say that I&#39;m glad to have met you, Yoruichi-chan 
(another flinch on Yoruichi&#39;s part). To be honest, I was starting to 
worry that Soi Fong hadn&#39;t made any friends.&quot; The two girls laughed 
uncomfortably at that, and afterwards the conversation degenerated into 
small talk until there was a knock at the door.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Soi said as she got out of her chair, eager for an excuse 
to evade pointless chit-chat.

&quot;Oh, here&#39;s the money,&quot; her father indicated a few bills in his hand. 
&quot;...Be sure to tip him, okay?&quot; The freshman nodded, taking the money and 
walking to the front door just as the visitor began a fresh stream of 
banging.

&quot;...I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m coming...&quot; Soi muttered in annoyance at the delivery 
man&#39;s apparent impatience as she turned the knob. Once she opened the 
door and saw who it was standing there, she did a double take.

...No way...

&quot;Hi, delivery for the Fong famil-- Wait a minute...&quot; the courier lifted 
up the brim of his striped bucket hat to reveal a pair of eyes staring 
out from behind a mess of sandy hair. His expression was indescernible 
for a few moments until his face broke into a smile. &quot;...Hey, I remember 
you! The kid with moxie, right?&quot;

&quot;Uh...Yeah, it&#39;s Soi Fong,&quot; the braided girl said as she gave him a 
slightly irritated glare. &quot;Uh...and you&#39;re Urahara, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me,&quot; he said casually. &quot;...So, this is your place, huh?&quot;</pre>
