&quot;...There she is! Hey, Yoruichi-- don&#39;tcha have any more karaoke CDs?&quot;

The girl in question blinked, suddenly aware that she was no longer 
ankle deep in the snow, watching Soi disappear into the cold night; 
instead Yoruichi had somehow trudged back inside and had shed her damp 
coat on the staircase railing, her feet already halfway up to her 
bedroom.

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Yoruichi half-mumbled, staring at a rather disheveled but 
not-quite-drunk Kuukaku who was trailed by Kisuke, apparently more 
interested in the remaining piece of cheesecake than singing. What were 
they doing here? When had she let them inside?

&quot;You know, CDs! If I don&#39;t find some more quick than Rangiku&#39;s gonna 
beat me to the rest of the sake!&quot;

Sake...present...Oh, right, Yoruichi suddenly realized, still feeling a 
bit numb. They were here for the party. Her party. She was ashamed to 
admit it, but she&#39;d completely forgotten.

&quot;Uh...there should be some more in the...the third drawer on the right 
of the TV cabinet...&quot; she answered slowly, her mind already wandering 
again.

&quot;Ah! I didn&#39;t even think to check there-- thanks!&quot; Kuukaku said with a 
grin, taking off back to the basement at full speed. Yoruichi watched 
her go, or rather stared at a dot on the wall in her direction for a 
moment before continuing her vertical march.

&quot;...Aren&#39;t you gonna come downstairs? You haven&#39;t sung at all yet, and I 
think Shunsui&#39;s about to put us through hell for the fifth time 
tonight,&quot; Kisuke asked in mock horror as he finished the dessert.

&quot;...No, I&#39;m...I&#39;m gonna go to bed...tell everyone they can stay the 
night, okay?&quot; Kisuke caught the strange aura his friend was creating, 
but after a few moments of silence nodded and watched her disappear 
behind a low wall.

----------

Yoruichi ran a finger over her lips again, this time almost hesitantly. 
It didn&#39;t make any sense-- she could easily slip away from even the 
fastest strikes of her Karate opponents, could outrun anybody. Without 
any real vanity she could easily say that there was no one she&#39;d met who 
was faster than her. And yet when Soi had...kissed her...she couldn&#39;t 
move. Not only that, but she had done it so lightly that Yoruichi 
wondered if it had really happened. It was strange for her to recieve 
such a gentle display of affection, especially since every kiss she&#39;d 
ever taken part in was more an act of blind lust than anything else.

&quot;...Soi...&quot; she whispered, surprised at the small bubble of apprehension 
that formed in her stomach at the thought of her friend but that 
disappeared just as quickly. So this explained it, the freshman&#39;s 
behavior for the past few months. Her first instinct was to dismiss it 
as just one of the many crushes she was the subject of, but the more she 
replayed the incident in her mind, the less it felt like something so 
ordinary.

...Why couldn&#39;t I move?

Yoruichi shook her head violently and shifted herself under the covers, 
trying to force herself asleep. Part of her didn&#39;t want to think about 
it now, and after a while she drifted uneasily into slumber.

She woke up three times that night, convinced each time that Soi was 
patiently waiting for her at the foot of her bed.

----------

The freshman groaned aloud as she clutched her forehead, as if doing so 
could erase what she&#39;d done.

&quot;Goddamnit! How could I be so STUPID?!&quot; The drafty room surrounding Soi 
Fong didn&#39;t answer, but she got the impression that if the walls could 
speak they would undoubtedly be taunting her. Giving a sigh of defeat, 
she plopped onto her bed, staring listlessly at the ceiling until her 
restless right hand traveled into her pocket and found her gift. Soi 
held it up, watching the necklace sparkle in the streetlight drifting 
through the window.

She could argue that she should have known better than to lose control 
like that, but...at that moment, just seeing her mother&#39;s necklace 
again, recieving such a wonderful gift from Yoruichi...it had been too 
much.

She must hate me, Soi thought glumly as she set the jewelry on her 
bedstand. She&#39;d never really meant to reveal her feelings to the 
upperclassman at all; her plan had been to just keep it all buried down. 
It would&#39;ve only made her miserable to watch Yoruichi eventually leave 
her, get married, start a life in which she had no part, but at least 
she would&#39;ve been able to share that time with her. Now she&#39;d ruined 
their friendship, even though friendship was the last thing she wanted 
from Yoruichi anymore. Before Soi could continue her train of thought 
she broke the silence of the room with a loud sneeze, and upon 
comprehending its significance cursed herself for staying outside for a 
whole hour.

----------

Sniffles, accompanied by the occasional sneeze, filled Soi&#39;s bedroom the 
next morning, and as the freshman tried to pull the covers closer around 
her neck to seal in the diminishing warmth she listened intently for the 
nearby telephone. Deciding that it was better than getting up and 
running all the way downstairs whenever it rung, she&#39;d grabbed the 
device along with a bowl of hot soup and salt crackers, along with her 
latest book, the only weapon against the encroaching boredom. Since, 
however, the narrative for this one happened to be quite dull as it was, 
her eyes kept wandering to the phone.

She had no reason to think that Yoruichi would call her but wasn&#39;t sure 
if she should initiate the contact herself. She needed to talk to the 
senior, work all this out. With any luck, she might be able to salvage 
their friendship, forget about what had happened yesterday.

...Do I really want to do that, Soi wondered as she reached towards the 
reciever and hesitated halfway. But then, it wasn&#39;t about what SHE 
wanted, Soi thought glumly. In spite of the fact that the older girl had 
such a delinquent nature she was still so much better than her, so much 
more deserving of someone else. With her last ounce of 
self-determination she picked up the phone and dialed her friend&#39;s 
number.

&quot;...Hello?&quot; The cheerful voice on the opposite end of the line nearly 
made Soi hang up right there, reminding her instantly of how strong a 
hold Yoruichi had on her. The freshman said nothing for a moment, and 
when Yoruichi began asking if anyone was there she finally answered.

&quot;H-hi, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

Just as she feared. Silence. For a moment Soi thought the line must have 
been disconnected, but then the other girl responded.

&quot;...Hey, Soi.&quot; The freshman could feel the tension building in the quiet 
that followed, but couldn&#39;t think of anything to say, of a way to break 
the ice.

Then she sneezed. Three times straight, and by the time she recovered 
she caught the slightest of chuckles on Yoruichi&#39;s end of the phone.

&quot;You got sick?&quot; Yoruichi asked, the giddiness returned to her voice and 
Soi unaware of its artificiality.

&quot;Y...Yeah, just a little cold. Probably cause of...all the snow 
lately...&quot;

&quot;...Well, I hope you feel better.&quot; Soi&#39;s breath caught in her chest. She 
didn&#39;t think Yoruichi would end the conversation this quickly, and with 
no real options for the response she had intended.

&quot;Okay...Bye, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

&quot;Later,&quot; the older girl replied moments before hanging up, leaving Soi 
to listen to the dull hum of the dial tone.

----------

About an hour later, Soi was trying to rest, still turning the 
conversation over in her head and wondering what she&#39;d done wrong when 
the doorbell rang far below. She had every intention of just ignoring 
it, especiallys since only salesman and the mailman came around this 
time of day, but when it kept tolling Soi groaned, forcing her tired 
muscles to lift her up out of bed, grabbing her comforter and wrapping 
it around her shoulders like a cape in a flimsy resistance to the cold. 
The chime grew louder as she descended the steps, her impatience growing 
with every step the girl took.

&quot;Look, my father&#39;s not in,&quot; Soi called as she turned the lock and pulled 
the door open, &quot;...so you can just wait until later toni-- 
Yoruichi-san!&quot;

&quot;...Mind if I come in?&quot; Yoruichi asked with a smile, though it was just 
a bit forced. Her younger friend gave a slight nod in the affirmative, 
stepping aside so that the upperclassman could shed her peacoat, 
brushing the snow out of her hair with a shake not unlike a wet cat. Soi 
felt her heart skip a beat when she saw Yoruichi remove the scarf she&#39;d 
given her but quickly looked away, deciding not to risk bringing the 
subject up. Yoruichi glanced in her friend&#39;s direction, stifling a grin 
at seeing her wrapped up in a blanket, aware that her eyes had lingered 
for a bit longer than the humor had lasted.

&quot;...Here,&quot; the older girl said evenly, holding up a bag marked with the 
trademark of a nearby pharmacy. &quot;I thought you could use some things.&quot;

&quot;T-thanks,&quot; Soi answered, catching a brief glimpse of the items in the 
bag, silently grateful as she&#39;d just run out of cold medicine.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it. Just returning the favor, is all.&quot; Something 
about the way she&#39;d said it, so passively as if the act held no real 
meaning to her, stung at Soi a little, but as far as she was concerned 
she was just lucky that Yoruichi was still talking to her. Soi wanted to 
ask her to have a seat, and though Yoruichi looked almost antsy to leave 
she wanted to say too, needed to speak. They stood there for a moment 
until Soi&#39;s instincts got the better of her.

&quot;...Do you want some hot tea, or water or something?&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#39;t stay long. Kisuke&#39;s got the car running outside.&quot; Yoruichi 
paused once she&#39;d spoken, wondering if she could say what was on her 
mind right now. She felt so tense in Soi&#39;s presence all of a sudden, a 
strange sort of weight on her chest that didn&#39;t make her suffer but had 
the discomfort of being unfamiliar, which in turn made her more 
uncomfortable. This wasn&#39;t like her to hesitate, the cocoa-skinned teen 
decided, so she decided to bite the bullet and began to speak.

&quot;...Listen Soi, about yesterday...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry!&quot;

Yoruichi blinked, frozen in mid-sentence by her friend&#39;s words. She 
turned to look at Soi, who was staring at the ground in an apologetic 
half-bow. Before she could process what the freshman had just said, or 
so much as respond, she had continued, never taking her eyes off that 
particular floorboard she was looking at.

&quot;...I...I didn&#39;t mean to do it, I swear! It&#39;s just... when I saw Mom&#39;s 
necklace again, I didn&#39;t know how to say &#39;thank you,&#39; so I just...&quot; Soi 
swallowed, eyes shut tight, hating herself for lying but knowing that it 
was probably the only way to keep Yoruichi&#39;s friendship. Her last words 
came out after a moment, in a barely audible whisper. &quot;...Please don&#39;t 
hate me, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

The older girl just stared at the top of Soi&#39;s head, a mixture of relief 
and disappointment stirring uncomfortably in the back of her mind. This 
was what she had wanted, after all; a chance to keep things the way they 
were, but hearing Soi tell her that kiss had been a mistake made 
something in the pit of her stomach turn, as if it was the insistence 
that something she instinctively knew to be true was not so. This whole 
situation made her feel off-balance, but for all her misgivings she only 
smiled and placed a hand gently on Soi&#39;s shoulder, prompting her to look 
up again. It was the most contact she dared to risk, but why she didn&#39;t 
know.

&quot;...Of course not, Soi! Don&#39;t worry about it-- water under the bridge 
and all that.&quot; It took the freshman&#39;s worried face a moment to light up, 
a relieved smile on her face that held Yoruichi&#39;s gaze in spite of 
herself.

&quot;S-so... We&#39;re still friends, right?&quot; Soi asked eagerly, and though the 
older of the two half-wanted to take back what she&#39;d said she simply 
forced herself to keep smiling.

&quot;Yeah... We&#39;re still friends.&quot;

A/N: Well, I&#39;m back. Don&#39;t worry, more updates to come soon, now that 
I&#39;m back at school.</pre>
