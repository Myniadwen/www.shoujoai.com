&quot;Are you okay? You&#39;re fidgeting.&quot;

It took Soi a moment, glancing down at the hands nervously intertwining 
and disengaging around her coffee cup that Kisuke was right. She looked 
over to the young man, nodding as he stroked the stubble on his chin in 
an air of rather feigned dignity.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; the Chinese woman assured him with a slight grin. 
&quot;Just... a little nervous.&quot; To be honest, she&#39;d forgotten this feeling, 
this growing apprehension that had been so familiar a lifetime ago-- her 
body was just readjusting to it. Urahara seemed to accept her 
declaration, as he leaned back in his seat as far as he could (not much 
considering the rigidness of airport seats) and lowered that damned 
striped hat over his brow, an indicator that he was done trying to stay 
awake for now. Waiting here for over an hour could do that even to him, 
Soi considered with a chuckle, taking another drink as she glanced 
around the terminal.

Soi wondered if they hadn&#39;t somehow ended up in a mall, considering the 
array of fast-food stands and stores-- actual clothing and music stores, 
for God&#39;s sake. Part of her actually wanted to get up and wander around, 
but what if the plane arrived and she wasn&#39;t ready? Soi was just about 
to take another sip of her coffee, the scent of french-vanilla creamer 
wafting up to her nose, when the P.A. spoke, nearly making her spill the 
hot drink.

&quot;Attention-- Flight 215 from Sydney will be touching down at Gate 12-B. 
Please prepare your luggage and boarding passes and wait until all 
passengers have departed before...&quot;

Soi didn&#39;t hear the rest as Kisuke stirred beside her; instead the girl 
glanced around until she found a reflection, patting down her hair where 
it seemed to stick up. She stared at herself for a moment, absently 
running her fingers through the tress of dark hair that now rested 
freely on her shoulders. She wasn&#39;t sure what had made her break such a 
long-standing habit-- the braids that she&#39;d worn since she was nine-- 
but the feeling that this look was strange had worn off a bit. Maybe at 
the time...she&#39;d just felt like it was time to change.

At the moment, though, Soi just hoped that she&#39;d still recognize her.

----------

Soi bit her lip as she stared at the crowd slowly coming through the 
walkway from the airliner, grimacing as she searched vainly for that 
familiar black hair, held up in a long ponytail.

&quot;See her?&quot; Urahara pondered aloud, as confused as she. He frowned a 
little more as his companion shook her head.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it... She said Flight 215, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;Then why hasn&#39;t she...?&quot; The two nearly jumped as a familiar voice came 
from behind them.

&quot;Long time no see, you two.&quot;

In an instant Soi turned about, her eyes bugging slightly as she felt 
her heart stop, the same rush of weightlessness hitting her just as 
strongly as it had before. It took her a moment to recognize the tall, 
dark-skinned woman, her hair short and cropped now, though in her heart 
she instantly knew who it was.

&quot;...Hi, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi grinned at her as she set her bag down, promptly 
giving the still-speechless girl a friendly hug, which Soi awkwardly 
returned. She&#39;d forgotten just how strong those arms were, the texture 
of the muscles on her back concealed by clothing and an orange 
windbreaker. She&#39;d just gotten used to the feeling of warmth washing 
over her all over again when Yoruichi pulled away, turning to her old 
friend and wrestling him into a headlock he feebly protested.

&quot;OW! N-nice to see you too, Yoru-cha--OWW!&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t act like you didn&#39;t expect this, Kisuke,&quot; Yoruichi grinned as 
she roughly ground her knuckles into his mop of blonde hair, unaware of 
the people casting disapproving looks in their direction. &quot;How have you 
been? Dropped out yet?&quot;

&quot;Actually--OWW! I...I&#39;m graduating next year,&quot; Urahara managed once 
Yoruichi let him go, now casting an approving glance at her friend.

&quot;Wow... in only five years? That&#39;s pretty impressive.&quot;

&quot;Well, trust me,&quot; Kisuke said knowingly as he picked up his fallen hat, 
&quot;...You do NOT want to do three years of advanced Med classes.&quot;

&quot;Well see, Kisuke? I knew you could do it.&quot; Yoruichi smiled at him as 
she picked up her bag again, following behind him to the parking lot, a 
pensive Soi bringing up the rear.

----------

Even sitting in the car, with herself in the back and Yoruichi catching 
up with Kisuke up front, Soi wasn&#39;t sure what she should have expected 
when Yoruichi returned. Not necessarily a big, movie-style embrace, 
running toward her in the middle of a crowd, Yoruichi fawning over her 
and telling her how glad she was to see her again... she hadn&#39;t really 
anticipated any of that, but for Yoruichi to almost brush her off... she 
felt a little hurt to say the least. While Yoruichi HAD been true to her 
word and had written her practically every day, over time their 
correspondence had dwindled to a postcard or two both ways. Soi still 
had all the letters she&#39;d been sent, carefully wrapped and placed in a 
shoe box beneath her bed-- more valuable than treasure-- but somehow 
just reading her handwriting didn&#39;t feel like enough.

She&#39;d heard that long-distance relationships didn&#39;t work out very often, 
and maybe it had happened to them already without her knowledge. But 
before she could think about it anymore she stopped herself. She had to 
trust Yoruichi, trust that she still loved her after all this time and 
distance. And even if it had all just faded away, she could still be 
there for Yoruichi-- no matter what.

&quot;So,&quot; Yoruichi said suddenly, turning around and flashing that 
Cheshire-Cat smile of hers at the freshly graduated Soi, &quot;...How are you 
now, Soi?&quot;

&quot;A-Alright,&quot; the teen managed after tearing her eyes away from 
Yoruichi&#39;s golden ones slightly. &quot;...Dad&#39;s doing okay. I still go there 
every weekend to have dinner with him.&quot;

&quot;...Must be weird living all alone. And are you STILL &#39;undeclared?&#39;&quot;

&quot;I just... I decided that I couldn&#39;t be a burden on Dad like that 
anymore. And besides... I don&#39;t need to hear that from YOU.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Touche,&quot; Yoruichi admitted with a chuckle as she turned back 
around in her seat.

&quot;Well, now that you&#39;re back in town we need to celebrate,&quot; Kisuke 
declared out of nowhere. &quot;How about I get everyone together for dinner 
tonight? I think Shunsui and Jyuushiro are open...&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding? I&#39;ve STILL got jet lag. Let&#39;s go tomorrow. I just need 
to relax,&quot; the dark-skinned woman said with a yawn as she stretched out 
as far as her seat would allow. &quot;Hey Soi-- think you can put me up for 
the night?&quot;

Soi blinked, surprised by the sudden request, and even more so that she 
instantly nodded despite her lousy apartment&#39;s considerable lack of 
room. She&#39;d forgotten just what that smile could do to her.

----------

&quot;Wow... it&#39;s really...&quot; Yoruichi mumbled, drifting off as she glanced 
around Soi&#39;s cramped domicile, from the tiny &#39;living room&#39; and kitchen 
to the single bedroom and bath nearby.

&quot;Tenement-quality?&quot;

&quot;...I was gonna say &#39;cozy,&#39;&quot; Yoruichi said with a cocked eyebrow, amused 
by Soi&#39;s quip despite her attempt to appear otherwise.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t be like that,&quot; Kisuke chimed in as he set Yoruichi&#39;s bag 
down beside the door. &quot;I helped decorate the place, you know.&quot; Yoruichi 
resisted the urge to say that she could tell. &quot;Well, if neither of you 
girls need anything else I&#39;ll get going. I&#39;ll call everyone about dinner 
tomorrow. Oh, and Yoruichi?&quot;

The young woman looked at him as he smiled at her, stepping onto the 
other side of the door as he did so.

&quot;...It&#39;s great to have you back.&quot;

Soi waved goodbye while Yoruichi gave him a small hug, then turned to 
the window to watch Kisuke&#39;s car pull out of the parking lot.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have much to eat, but help yourself to what&#39;s in the 
fridge,&quot; Soi began as she continued to stare out the window. &quot;...Or I 
guess if you&#39;re too tired you could just shower and go to sleep. Now I 
guess I could let you have the bed today, but we&#39;re gonna have to take 
t--&quot;

She stopped short as dark hands slowly wrapped around her waist, 
tightening as the body they were connected to wordlessly pulled her back 
into a warm embrace. It took her a moment to get her body to move again, 
and when she succeeded all Soi could do was turn her head back to find a 
pair of topaz orbs glittering down at her, completely unlike those she&#39;d 
seen just a few hours earlier. It was then that she noticed Yoruichi 
trembling slightly, her bottom lip quavering as if, like her, she had a 
million things to say but no words that captured them.

She felt Yoruichi&#39;s grip tighten as her head lowered to hers, lips 
meeting as patiently as either could muster. It had been so long but all 
of a sudden Soi felt like not a single second had passed between them, 
like these four years had just been a passing dream. Soi felt her hand 
slide up to the back of Yoruichi&#39;s head of its own accord, gently 
forcing her beloved&#39;s kiss to deepen, which Yoruichi made no objection 
to; in fact she almost seemed to sigh into Soi&#39;s mouth, making the girl 
shudder. Yoruichi&#39;s hand was teasing the belly button just under the hem 
of Soi&#39;s shirt when a sudden beeping sounded from Soi&#39;s pocket. Soi 
blinked, then reluctantly reached for her cell phone.

&quot;H-hold on a sec-- I should see who it i--&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

The Chinese girl froze instantly at Yoruichi&#39;s whispered response; it 
was an order, a request and a plea all at once, and before Soi could 
think of an excuse Yoruichi nibbled at her ear, leaving a row of warm 
kisses as she traveled along pale skin to her collarbone. She&#39;d waited 
an eternity for this, for this sense of wholeness, for Soi again, so 
much so that her fatigue had left her the second she&#39;d seen her waiting 
in the terminal, had taken every ounce of self-control she didn&#39;t know 
she had just to avoid ravishing her on the spot. She&#39;d be damned if 
anyone interrupted them now.

Soi wasn&#39;t resisting, but the cell phone was still ringing in her hand, 
as if she reluctant to let it go. With a single movement Yoruichi 
grabbed the clamorous device and tossed it onto the floor, never 
breaking the ravenous kiss she&#39;d initiated with Soi. She deepened it 
even more when she felt Soi melt into her, the want and longing and love 
in those silver eyes making it clear that once again, they were on the 
same page.

----------

&quot;...You kept it.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Soi mumbled groggily as she shifted in Yoruichi&#39;s embrace, 
slightly resenting the way the sheets clung to her skin due to her lack 
of a properly working air conditioner. Today, though, with the body of 
the only one she could ever truly love beside her again, it didn&#39;t seem 
to matter terribly. Without opening her eyes she could feel fingertips 
tickling the skin below her throat, playing idly with the ruby and 
silver necklace that rested there. &quot;...Of course I did. It was from 
you.&quot;

Yoruichi said nothing, but somehow Soi could feel the warmth of her gaze 
radiate through her-- completely unlike the stifling humidity 
surrounding them. She smiled herself as that single hand slid up to her 
face, gently tracing bumps and dips with an almost...adoring caress. Soi 
let her fingers idle through Yoruichi&#39;s short locks, unsure if she could 
get entirely used to how different it felt, the weight and flow of them 
altered from her memories. But then, she thought with a smile, at least 
I&#39;ll never get used to her. Not that she could ever see herself tiring 
of Yoruichi.

&quot;You look different,&quot; Yoruichi said almost sadly.

&quot;...So do you.&quot; Soi was quiet before she spoke again, this time opening 
her eyes to find Yoruichi&#39;s locked onto her, as if she was the only 
person in the world that mattered. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s...a bad 
different?&quot;

Yoruichi didn&#39;t directly answer; instead she curled around Soi, huddling 
close like she was trying to fuse with the teen, to maintain this 
serenity that only existed with her forever. Burying her face into Soi&#39;s 
long, unbound hair, she breathed its comforting scent in gratefully as 
she whispered so quietly that only Soi could, or would, ever hear her.

&quot;...I missed you.&quot;

But even after she&#39;d said it, the words didn&#39;t seem like enough. She 
couldn&#39;t say that she&#39;d stopped writing Soi because it made her ache to 
return to her side, cross the Atlantic and be with Soi for the rest of 
her life, come what may. But she had wanted, also to be strong, to show 
Soi that they could be apart long enough to stand it, that they weren&#39;t 
helpless on their own. Right now, all that just seemed like empty words. 
Soi was hers and she was Soi&#39;s, but the thought somehow didn&#39;t frighten 
her like it would have.

No freedom had ever been worth this, and even when Soi pecked her on the 
forehead and slid out of bed she still felt lighter than she had in her 
whole life.

&quot;Hey, Dad called,&quot; Soi said as she peeked back into the bedroom, her 
nudity concealed by the door. &quot;He says that he wants us all to come for 
dinner.&quot;

&quot;Mnnph...I don&#39;t feel like going out...&quot;

&quot;Oh come on--this is my DAD we&#39;re talking about. And I&#39;m sure you could 
use some pizza.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Yoruichi relented with a chuckle. &quot;...Just give me a minute 
to get dressed.&quot; Soi nodded as she headed into her room, Yoruichi 
passing her to get her bag, stealing a kiss as she went, grinning as Soi 
rewarded her with the slightest of blushes.

----------

Yoruichi pondered, slipping on a pair of slacks as she glanced at the 
door, how being with someone could feel so right, so calming, could 
bring her into the closest thing she&#39;d ever had to a real family. 
Rifling through the folded clothes she paused as her hand came across a 
small jewelry box, the square of leather smooth against her hand. Making 
sure she wasn&#39;t being watched, she looked over her shoulder before 
opening the case, a slender silver band held firmly inside.

She wondered if now was the time to give it to Soi, if she could even 
ask so soon. But the feeling that had been with her when she&#39;d bought 
it-- that there wasn&#39;t a single person in the world she&#39;d rather give 
this to-- hadn&#39;t faded in the slightest. Yoruichi was still looking at 
the ring when she heard the door shut behind her.

&quot;Ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Uhh,&quot; Yoruichi fumbled as she stuffed the box back into the bottom of 
her bag, &quot;...Yeah, let&#39;s go.&quot; She turned to Soi, unable to hide the 
smile that found its way to her lips at Soi&#39;s gentle gaze.

No, Yoruichi decided as she opened the door, beckoning Soi through with 
an exaggerated display of manners, making the younger woman stifle a 
laugh. Soi would never begrudge her the time she needed to think this 
out, to wait, and would probably advise patience until they were both 
ready and certain.

With Soi, she had all the time in the world-- and that, more than 
anything else, comforted Yoruichi as she shut the door behind them.

The End

Acknowledgements and Final Thoughts

Wow... it&#39;s really over.

It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s really been over a year since the first 
chapter of &quot;The Cat and the Bee&quot; debuted to moderate popularity. Now, 
however, it&#39;s grown to a respectable fanbase, and has become the single 
most popular piece I&#39;ve ever written. All I can say, quite frankly, is 
that I&#39;m deeply flattered and more than a little suprised by how it&#39;s 
been embraced by so many people-- especially since it&#39;s one of the 
(sadly) few multichapter yuri fics of the Bleach fandom, which we all 
know is mainly dominated by het and yaoi (not a criticism, just a 
statement of fact).

A few people have told me that I changed Yoruichi and Soi&#39;s characters 
quite a bit in this series, and I&#39;ll be the first to acknowledge that 
it&#39;s true. But as one of the major aspects of C&amp;B is growth and change, 
I think it&#39;s a legitimate alteration. Yes, they&#39;re not entirely true to 
Kubo Tite&#39;s Yoruichi and Soi Fong, but since these two are in a &quot;real&quot; 
world, having them remain with static personalities they have in the 
manga/anime doesn&#39;t really work as a character piece.

As I&#39;m just a simple fanfic writer I cannot claim that this is perfect 
by any means, but I only hope that everyone who&#39;s read &quot;C&amp;B&quot; has enjoyed 
it and been entertained by it, and maybe even gotten something from it. 
And, of course, that I&#39;ve done this woefully underappreciated and 
dismissed pairing a bit of justice.</pre>
