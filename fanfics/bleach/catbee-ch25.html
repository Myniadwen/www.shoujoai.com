Aizen glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands reading that it was a 
quarter to four while it ticked steadily away. He&#39;d tried to get near 
Momo for the last few days, but from teachers to a gaggle of students 
she never seemed to be alone anymore. The gratitude he&#39;d felt at first 
of not losing his job had long since faded, slowly replaced by a 
festering resentment that had led to this meeting he&#39;d requested earlier 
in the day. While he&#39;d blamed himself at first for letting things get so 
out of hand, which had never happened before, the teacher had soon had 
an epiphany as to the real target of his anger.

Yoruichi Shihouin had done this to him, had destroyed the closest thing 
to a relationship he&#39;d had in years with a single utterance. It was her, 
and not himself or even the Principal that deserved his wrath now. He 
already had enough information on her to satisfy even the most 
insatiable of gossipers, but he doubted that the dark-skinned girl was 
the type to be bothered by such things. He&#39;d need to get to her another 
way. A knock at the door interrupted his musings and he straightened in 
his seat slightly.

&quot;...Come in, Ichimaru.&quot;

Gin opened the classroom door with a casual shove, walking into the 
empty room with a saunter even though he was unsure about the whole 
situation. Aizen wasn&#39;t one of his teachers, so what could he want him 
for?

&quot;Hey, teach,&quot; the perpetually grinning boy said as he slid into a nearby 
desk. &quot;...So whaddya want?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; the bespectacled man began nonchalantly, &quot;...I was wondering 
how well you knew Yoruichi Shihouin.&quot; He grinned in spite of himself as 
the boy&#39;s smile faltered for barely a second-- just long enough to tell 
him there was no love lost between the two.

&quot;...Why&#39;d ya wanna know &#39;bout that?&quot;

&quot;Just curious,&quot; Aizen replied with a shrug. &quot;...I suppose you could say 
that she&#39;s in some trouble.&quot; There was a silence as Gin considered the 
significance of the statement, then Aizen continued. &quot;...I&#39;m fully aware 
of your...reputation...and I was curious as to whether or not you&#39;d like 
to assist me.&quot;

Gin blinked, surprised at what he was hearing. Wasn&#39;t Aizen supposedly 
this pillar of upstanding morality, beloved by nearly every 
goody-two-shoes the school had to offer?

&quot;No one would know it was you, of course...but I can assure you that you 
won&#39;t go unrewarded for your efforts.&quot;

&quot;...Eh. Not int&#39;rested.&quot; Aizen stared at the lanky teen, certain he had 
heard wrong.

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t rat ya out, but this kinda thing isn&#39;t my style.&quot; 
He&#39;d seen teachers crack before (having more than once been the root 
cause) and he knew that if one was to ask a petty thug like him for aid 
that it was something big-- too big for him to stick his nose into. 
After a few stunned moments the teacher nodded, accepting the boy&#39;s 
response.

&quot;...Very well. But there&#39;s one more thing...&quot; Aizen dug in the top 
drawer of his desk for only a moment before pulling out a clean sheet of 
paper. &quot;...I&#39;d like to ensure that Miss Shihouin&#39;s friends aren&#39;t 
dragged into all this when I address her behavior to the Principal. Is 
there anyone you know of who&#39;s particularly close to her?&quot; Ichimaru 
doubted greatly that Aizen was gathering this information for the safety 
of Yoruichi&#39;s companions, but deciding that he probably wouldn&#39;t do 
anything terribly malicious the boy consented.

&quot;Hmm...Well, Kisuke Urahara&#39;s around her a lot...&quot;

No good, Aizen thought as he wrote the name down. He knew as well as 
anyone how far back they went, but such an obvious target might draw too 
much attention back to himself. Besides, he doubted that the boy would 
be easily vulnerable to an attack, open or not.

&quot;...Kuukaku Shiba...&quot;

Not much better. She might be even more of a problem than Urahara to 
deal with, not to mention that she bore a great deal of resentment 
toward him anyway and would be the first on her &#39;suspects list.&#39;

&quot;...Oh, yeah...an&#39; Soi Fong.&quot;

&quot;...Who?&quot; Aizen blinked as his pencil stopped, halted at the unfamiliar 
name.

&quot;Ya probably don&#39;t know &#39;er,&quot; Gin answered with a shrug. &quot;...Freshman. 
Been hangin&#39; around Shihouin quite a bit lately.&quot; Something about this 
confused the instructor, and he adjusted his thick glasses as if to 
improve blood flow to his brain.

&quot;...Why would she be in the company of a freshman? Doesn&#39;t she ignore 
people like that?&quot;

&quot;Dunno. Her business, not mine.&quot; When Aizen didn&#39;t answer, Ichimaru gave 
a sigh and headed for the door. &quot;Well, later teach. I got stuff ta do 
anyway.&quot; Sosuke was aware that he might have nodded but he was too 
focused on the last name on his list to care. A freshman...probably not 
too strong... he pulled out another list, one of all the hoodlums and 
punks he&#39;d kept track of over his years as a teacher and ran his fingers 
down the lines of information. With a target in mind, he looked for an 
equally suitable pawn. Once he found one, he was about to circle the 
number when he hesiated. Was he really willing to risk throwing all this 
away-- his job and his reputation-- to get back at Yoruichi? He had only 
to recall the crushed look on Momo&#39;s face in the Principal&#39;s office 
before he regained his resolve and highlighted the contact information 
in yellow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Soi! HEY, SOI! WAKE UP!&quot; The freshman groaned and was about to implore 
the voice for five more minutes when she suddenly realized that it was 
Yoruichi&#39;s calling from the opposite side of the door.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi?...It&#39;s Saturday...what&#39;re you doin&#39; here?&quot;

&quot;...What kind of a question is that? Come on! We were gonna go through 
your clothes for the dance, remember? Oh, mind if I come in?&quot; Soi 
blinked awake instantly as her friend pushed the door open, gathering 
the loose covers around her as quickly as she could. &quot;...You&#39;re just in 
your pajamas, for God&#39;s sake,&quot; the upperclassman quipped with a roll of 
the eyes as she yanked the sheets off Soi&#39;s bed. &quot;Now you go get some 
breakfast real quick, and I&#39;ll look through what you got.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Soi yawned, rubbing her eyes in an effort to force herself to 
cognizance. &quot;Wha&#39; for?&quot;

&quot;Well, if I&#39;m gonna take you shopping then we need to figure out what 
you&#39;re gonna need, right?

&quot;S-Shopping? But you didn&#39;t say anything about that,&quot; Soi exclaimed at 
the rather surprising way this information had been tossed at her. 
&quot;...I&#39;ve gotta get homework done today, and besides th--&quot; Yoruichi 
silenced the girl with a hissing sound as she held her finger over her 
own lips.

&quot;No talking! Now go get somethin&#39; to eat and then get your butt back up 
here!&quot; The freshman&#39;s eyes widened in surprise at the &#39;order&#39; but she 
complied nontheless, bustling out of the room so fast she nearly tripped 
over her own feet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Okay, Yoruichi, I&#39;m r-- What the hell are you doing!&quot; The upperclassman 
blinked as she poked her head out from the tiny closet, tossing an old 
blue sweater out from behind her as she did so.

&quot;...I&#39;m going through your clothes, of course... what does it look 
like?&quot; Soi stared in horror as her immaculately clean room (or as clean 
as it could get, anyway) was now covered with clothing she&#39;d packed away 
or carefully stored, had put in boxes that had balanced precariously in 
the far corner of the space until a few minutes ago.

&quot;...Like a tsunami hit! What&#39;s going on? I thought you were just going 
to look at the stuff that was on hangers!&quot;

&quot;Well, I was GOING to,&quot; Yoruichi said wryly as she held up a t-shirt 
with a Doraemon picture emblazoned across the front, then heaved it over 
her head and onto the floor behind her, &quot;...but all of it was either 
unsuitable or school uniforms.&quot;

&quot;...&#39;Unsuitable?&#39;&quot; the Chinese girl asked indignantly, walking up to her 
friend with a furrowed brow. She knew she wasn&#39;t exactly a Shinjuku 
regular but that didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t have a sense of fashion that 
worked for her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with this?&quot; Soi held up one of her 
favorite dress shirts, a red one that had a slight frill at the hem and 
the ends of the sleeves.

&quot;Come ON, Soi... You really think that anyone goes to these things 
dressed like they&#39;re at a parent&#39;s dinner party?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn WHAT anyone thinks I&#39;m wearing,&quot; Soi said with a 
degree of pride that intrigued Yoruichi, though she didn&#39;t voice it. 
&quot;..I&#39;m not gonna go looking like a slut.&quot; The older girl stared for a 
moment, then broke into laughter at her friend&#39;s statement, giggling so 
hard that she doubled over and plopped onto the floor. Soi would have 
been angry but she ran over instead, worried that Yoruichi had hurt 
herself.

&quot;D...don&#39;t worry,&quot; Yoruichi said through mirthful tears as she managed 
to get back on her feet. &quot;...The clothes broke my fall. Oh God, the way 
you just SAID that...&quot; She started to chuckle again only to hear Soi 
reluctantly join in, and after a few moments Yoruichi got a hold of 
herself and put a hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Seriously, though, you 
should wear something NICE... Trust me, it can feel good to dress up 
once in a while.&quot; Soi knew that if Yoruichi hadn&#39;t made that little bit 
of physical contact she probably could&#39;ve put up more of a fight, but 
instead she found herself giving an acquiescent sigh and minutes later 
waving goodbye to her father while Yoruichi assured him that she&#39;d have 
his daugher home in time for dinner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Soi had to admit that while she hated the act of shopping, she was happy 
with Yoruichi&#39;s choice of location. She preferred the shopping arcade to 
the noisy malls, full of grungy kids who were probably drug dealers and 
obnoxious sales people who were obviously working on commission, always 
cloying and presenting the most expensive piece of attire they had in 
stock. Normally she bought clothing only in the most dire of times when 
her shirts and pants had gotten too small for her and she was forced to 
accept the money her father gave.

&quot;...Hey, let&#39;s go here first,&quot; Yoruichi called over the din of the open 
market as she nudged Soi into what looked like an accesories shop, full 
of second-hand and homemade hairpieces and earrings.

&quot;You sure seem to know your way around here, Yoruichi-san...&quot; Soi said 
with a bit of surprise as she glanced around the shop, having never 
gotten this far into the arcade before; she usually just found the 
closest store and got her business done with minimal fuss.

&quot;What, I can&#39;t shop at a normal place?&quot; the girl asked teasingly, and to 
her delight Soi blushed and hung her head.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean anything by it...&quot;

&quot;Just kidding, Soi! Jeez...&quot; Yoruichi smiled, then headed straight for a 
small table with different colored pieces on it. &quot;Well, let&#39;s start with 
earrings first... You prefer silver over gold or the other way around?&quot;

&quot;Um, silver, I guess...&quot; Soi said with evident unease, shifting her 
weight from foot to foot. Just seeing Yoruichi get so enthusiastic over 
her like this...she wasn&#39;t sure if she should read more into it then 
that, but... &quot;Actually,&quot; the freshman admitted as she shifted her gaze 
to the little girl in the piercing booth screaming out in agony, &quot;...I 
kinda don&#39;t wear earrings.&quot; Yoruichi looked at her friend as though she 
lived in a foreign country, then gave a sigh as she put down a pair of 
hoops that would&#39;ve looked perfect on the freshman.

&quot;Well, I guess that leaves that out earrings...&quot; the senior admitted 
with a groan as she headed for another table, this one covered with 
bands and necklaces. &quot;You don&#39;t have any reasonable objections to 
wearing anything like this, do you?&quot;

&quot;I, uh, guess not...&quot;

&quot;Good, &#39;cause you&#39;re getting some,&quot; Yoruichi said with a grin as she 
started digging throught the bracelets. &quot;Let&#39;s see...no, too big...these 
are a little too gaudy...&quot;

&quot;Hey, what about this?&quot; Soi asked as she held up a bracelet set, each 
one bearing a swirling pattern on its wide face in alternating silver 
and copper. Her older companion looked at it for a minute before raising 
an eyebrow in slight disgust.

&quot;Ehh...&quot; she intoned as she guided Soi&#39;s hand down, placing the jewelry 
back, &quot;...I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really for you. Tell you what, just let 
me see what I can find, okay?&quot;

&quot;...Okay...&quot; Soi grudgingly admitted as she let go of the bracelet and 
allowed Yoruichi to return to her searching.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Well, only one thing left to get,&quot; Yoruichi said with a significance 
that implied it was the most important thing of all as they headed into 
a small shop near the end of the district. Soi felt the bile in her 
throat rise as she walked through the door, into territory both unknown 
and unwelcome.

&quot;...I still don&#39;t see why I have to wear a dress,&quot; the freshman grumbled 
as she shifted the bag in her right hand to her left. &quot;Can&#39;t I just wear 
a nice suit or something?&quot;

&quot;What, and have people thinking you&#39;re a boy?&quot; Yoruichi teased as they 
started to wander past the racks of multicolored cloth, through forests 
of skirts ranging in length from puritan to scandalous.

&quot;Seriously, Yoruichi! I&#39;m just gonna look and feel stupid if I&#39;m primped 
up like that,&quot; Soi replied with a slight edge to her voice. &quot;...I 
haven&#39;t worn one of those things since I was at my grandma&#39;s funeral, 
for crying out loud.&quot; Yoruichi managed to resist the desire to ask how 
long ago that was since by the younger girl&#39;s tone it couldn&#39;t have been 
recent.

&quot;Oh, come on, Soi...&quot; Yoruichi said as she turned around, making the 
younger girl stop just before running into her. &quot;You&#39;re way too critical 
of your appearance. I happen to think that you&#39;re very cute.&quot;

&quot;H-huh?&quot; Soi said dumbly as her eyes went wide, knowing that she was 
being ridiculous but unable to stop herself from reacting. &quot;...Really?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; the upperclassman said with a bit of confusion, as if it 
was no big deal. &quot;...Now come on, I&#39;ll help you find something good.&quot;

&quot;Well, actually,&quot; Soi began as Yoruichi set about examining the nearest 
rack of formal dresses, feeling a strange sort of confidence at the 
older girl&#39;s words, &quot;...I think I wanna pick this one out myself.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s no problem...You just show &#39;em to me and I&#39;ll see how well 
they work for y--&quot; Yoruichi was cut off as Soi interrupted, biting her 
lip nervously as if she was about to say something heretical in the 
presence of a religious zealot.

&quot;No...I mean, I want to do this on my own.&quot; There was a silence as 
Yoruichi stared at the girl, wondering if she was serious.

&quot;Well, you kinda don&#39;t have any fashion s--&quot; As soon as she&#39;d said it 
Yoruichi regretted it; especially when Soi&#39;s eyes turned from dinner 
plates to slivers and her nervous shaking ended.

&quot;...I...I can find a dress! You think I can&#39;t make a decision for 
myself?&quot; When Yoruichi didn&#39;t answer Soi began shoving her friend toward 
the door, even though she didn&#39;t actually succeed in pushing the older 
girl more than a few inches. &quot;That&#39;s it! You...wait out...side...and 
I&#39;ll be out in fifteen minutes!&quot; When she couldn&#39;t push anymore Yoruichi 
shrugged and headed for the door, wearing a condescending grin on her 
face.

&quot;All right...but if you take more than that I&#39;m gonna come back in and 
pick something out.&quot;

&quot;Fine!&quot; Soi growled with an almost childlike petulance, then stormed off 
as the bell on the door jingled behind Yoruichi, dashing straight for 
the formal dresses.

What did I just get myself into, Soi groaned to herself, cursing her 
pride for getting the best of her. She didn&#39;t know the first thing about 
dresses but here she was, with no guidance as she searched through racks 
in her size (she assumed). But for Yoruichi to think she was completely 
helpless... she shoved the thought away as she scrambled, casting aside 
a slinky red dress that ended just at the calves, then ignored one with 
poofy sleeves and too long a hem in lavender with sequins. Soi&#39;s time 
was almost up when she stumbled across the black dresses and stopped. 
She stared at the one that had caught her eye, then took it off its 
stand and held up for a better view. Elegant, but not flashy... 
conservatively designed, but not without an indescribable sensuality... 
not too mention that she rather liked the way the red sash complimented 
the dress... She was certain that it would&#39;ve been out of her price 
range until she glanced at the tag, and finding that it was on clearance 
immediately rushed to the dressing room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoruichi sighed as she leaned against the outer wall of the shop, 
glancing at her watch and smiling victoriously. It had been nearly 
thirteen minutes since she&#39;d left the building and still Soi wasn&#39;t out 
yet. Not that she blamed her; she didn&#39;t know a single girl who could&#39;ve 
found a decent outfit in only a quarter of an hour. Most likely she had 
gone into panic mode and was randomly picking things off the rack, at 
which point she&#39;d have to go in and hel--

&quot;I&#39;m done,&quot; a quiet voice spoke beside her as the door swung shut, and 
it took Yoruichi a few minutes to realize that it was Soi; she didn&#39;t 
seem in the slightest bit perturbed or overstressed, and more than that 
she had a long plastic-covered outfit slung over her shoulder. She 
stared for a minute longer as she tried to recover her mental 
equilibrium.

&quot;Y-you&#39;re finished?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; Soi answered plainly as she began to follow the path back 
through the shopping arcade to home. &quot;It really wasn&#39;t too bad, 
actually.&quot;

&quot;Well, here,&quot; Yoruichi said after a few moments, swallowing her pride as 
she reached in her purse, &quot;...I can give you some money to make up for 
what you spent...&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s no big deal...It was on clearance, anyway.&quot; The older girl 
felt a bit skeptical of anything that she could have found on sale, but 
decided that it wasn&#39;t worth it to get in an argument right now.

&quot;...So, can I see it?&quot; Yoruichi made to lift the bottom of the dress&#39;s 
plastic cover but Soi jerked away from her before she could get a good 
look.

&quot;Hm...I don&#39;t know... you&#39;re the one who thought I had &#39;no fashion 
sense,&#39; remember?&quot; Surprised by the teasing grin on the freshman&#39;s face, 
Yoruichi took a moment to follow suit, then tried in vain to grab the 
article of clothing from her.

&quot;Come on, just a peek...&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; Soi replied, yanking the dress away before Yoruichi nearly 
succeded. &quot;...I&#39;m not gonna take this thing out until the dance-- if I 
see it before then I know I&#39;m gonna want to take it back.&quot; Yoruichi gave 
a disappointed huff as she gave up, then followed her friend with the 
rest of thier purchases.

&quot;All right,&quot; the upperclassman muttered in defeat. &quot;...But I&#39;m gonna see 
you in that dress one way or another.&quot;</pre>
