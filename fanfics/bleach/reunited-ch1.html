<h1>Reunited</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bleach/index.html">Bleach</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Soi Fon remembered that moment well, when Yoruichi
Shihoin smiled in that warm way and told her to use
her first name. At that moment her heart soared as she
looked up at that dusky skinned face, and she knew
that she had found the one she had always been looking
for.

&#39;Even after a hundred years or inactivity,&#39; Soi Fon
thought wryly as she slugged back some sake, &#39;she was
really as good as ever.&#39; She had trained hard,
intensely for the day that Yoruichi would return, but
still...

Twisting and grappling in midair Soi Fon had struggled
to focus on the battle, but a treacherous part of her
mind sang with pure joy over feeling her former
leader&#39;s touch, breathing in her sweet scent once
again. When in her pride she taunted Yoruichi with her
&#39;new&#39; and &#39;ultimate&#39; move... she quickly found out why
her old captain was her master. She had devised the
same move ALREADY.

Silently the waitress set another full cup down, and
Soi Fon looked up at her with a slight frown, &quot;I
didn&#39;t order this.&quot;

&quot;The lady at the bar sent this,&quot; she answered, ger
brown hair shimmering, &quot;with her compliments.&quot;

Soi Fon looked up curiously, then froze as her mouth
dropped open and she gasped out, &quot;Yoruichi-sama?&quot;

From where she sat at the bar, Yoruichi gracefully
rose then strode across the bar, her black hair
shining in the lights. She looked like a goddess
amoung the common denizens of the bar, a warrior queen
among peasants. Soi Fon felt a quiver of anxiety as
she reached her table, studying her a moment...

&quot;Yo,&quot; Yoruichi smiled, sitting down.

Soi Fon nearly fell out of her chair as the brown
haired girl yelped, &quot;Do you have to take things so
casually?!&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Yoruichi smirked, waving for a drink. As the
waitress arrived she cheerfully instructed her, &quot;Keep
&#39;em coming.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; the waitress beamed before hurrying off.

&quot;Arrgh,&quot; Soi Fon sighed, looking up at her wryly. &quot;I
guess I should have expected that remark, coming from
you,&quot; she conceded.

Her smile was remarkably gentle as Yoruichi said,
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you.&quot; A grin, &quot;Especially when we&#39;re
not trying to kill each other.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like I could manage it,&quot; Soi Fon admitted
with a sigh.

Yoruichi took a drink then calmly clouted Soi Fon
across the head.

&quot;Oww!&quot; Soi Fon yelped.

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate yourself,&quot; Yoruichi said firmly,
&quot;I never expected anyone else to successfully figure
out that method... I was literally stunned when I saw
you use it.&quot;

Soi Fon felt herself blush, and silently wished for
better control. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered, smiling.

More drinks arrived, and Yoruichi pushed one to Soi
Fon. Raising her glass she smiled, &quot;To absent
friends.&quot;

Soi Fon tapped her cup to Yoruichi&#39;s and echoed,
&quot;Absent friends.&quot; They both drank, setting their cups
down as Soi Fon puffed out a breath, &quot;I&#39;m not used to
this sort of drinking.&quot;

Yoruichi chuckled, &quot;We&#39;ll have to toughen you up.&quot;

&quot;No thank you,&quot; Soi Fon replied wryly.

There was a moment of silence at the table as more
drinks were delivered. Yoruichi picked up her glass,
studying the clear fluid within. &quot;When we fought,&quot; she
said softly, &quot;you asked why I hadn&#39;t taken you with me
when I left.&quot;

Soi Fon&#39;s eyes widened a bit, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it was
presumptuous of me to ask you that...&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Yoruichi reached out, gently putting a finger
over Soi Fon&#39;s lips, you have every right to ask
that... I&#39;m just not sure how to answer.&quot;

&quot;Captain!&quot; Soi Fon yelped.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t!&quot; Yoruichi growled, slamming down
another drink. Grabbing one of Soi Fon&#39;s she slammed
that down too, &quot;Damn it, maybe being drunk will help.&quot;

Soi Fon looked at her a bit dubiously, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you
prefer a nice glass of milk?&quot;

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; Yoruichi smiled at Soi Fon. She sipped
her drink as her face took on a serious expression,
&quot;When I left Soul Society, I knew what the cost would
be... that I could never come back, and it could cost
me my life.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Soi Fon agreed, taking a bracing drink.

Yoruichi looked off into the distance, &quot;You had your
whole life ahead of you, a chance at a bright
future... I couldn&#39;t ask you to sacrifice that for
me.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have had to ask,&quot; Soi Fon admitted with
a sigh.

&quot;I think I knew that,&quot; Yoruichi conceded as she looked
at her former second in command fondly, &quot;that&#39;s why I
didn&#39;t tell you.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Soi Fon looked at her lingeringly, the drinks
having given her unusual courage, &quot;what do you intend
to do now?&quot;

Yoruichi smiled back as she admitted, &quot;I will be
returning to earth, but...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Soi Fon asked softly.

Yoruichi reached out to stroke her pale cheek gently,
&quot;I&#39;d love to have you visit me some time.&quot;

Soi Fon sighed happily, rubbing her cheek against that
caressing hand. &quot;And I&#39;d love to visit you,&quot; she
agreed, not mentioning what else she wanted to do with
her.

&quot;It&#39;s a date,&quot; Yoruichi agreed, her eyes twinkling
warmly. She stretched, sighing then said, &quot;Now I think
I&#39;d better sleep this off, or I&#39;m going to feel
terrible in the morning.&quot;

As Yoruichi got up Soi Fon got up, grabbing her hand
before she could leave, &quot;Yoruichi-sama?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Yoruichi asked.

Seizing all her courage Soi Fon leaned forward to kiss
her gently. &quot;For later,&quot; she smiled.

With a grin Yoruichi agreed, &quot;Later.&quot;

End

Notes: I confess that I&#39;ve only started seriously
reading Bleach, so I apologize for any mistakes. I did
a marathon reading session of later chapters to get a
feel for Yoruichi and Soi Fon, and I find I rather
like them. Never did find the Soi Fon omakes, so if
anyone knows what chapters they were let me know.
