...Is this really the place?

Soi blinked at the address scribbled onto a tiny slip of paper, hardly 
believing that this could possibly be the location she spent half an 
hour waiting to get from the abrasive school secretary.

I mean, I heard she was rich, but still...!

The freshman wasn&#39;t sure what she had expected of Yoruichi&#39;s home--now 
that she thought about it, the upperclassman had never once brought it 
up in conversation-- but she hadn&#39;t expected it to be nearly this nice. 
Set in one of the town&#39;s more expensive neighborhoods (the house was 
only about a ten-minute&#39;s walk from the school) and with its 
intimidating size and wide lawn, it seemed more like a small castle than 
a place people would actually be allowed to live in. As she slowly 
approached the glossy wooden front door, she silently took in the 
elaborately carved wood trim and the even, trimmed hedges, not feeling 
envious so much as overwhelmed by the upscale life her friend led, or at 
least seemed to lead as opposed to the Yoruichi she knew at school.

Not seeing a doorbell, Soi grabbed the brass knocker attached to the 
front door and pounded on it three times. Soi waited for a few minutes 
as she glanced nervously at her watch, which flashed 4:23 at her in red.

Okay, I&#39;ve just gotta get these papers to her and head out. I should 
still have plenty of time to change into my gi if I hurry...

&quot;Um, Yoruichi-san? Are you here?&quot; When no one answered, Soi 
experimentally pushed on the handle and to her surprise the door gave 
way.

That&#39;s wierd... Did Yoruichi feel secure enough that she didn&#39;t lock her 
door even when she wasn&#39;t home? Ignoring this absurd thought with a 
shake of the head, Soi slipped her shoes off on the concrete front step, 
then walked inside and nearly gasped.

If she had thought the exterior was nice, the inside of the house left 
her speechless. The front door connected to a tile-floored atrium, 
painted a warm shade of peach that led into a living room spacious 
enough to hold at least three-quarters of her house inside it. She 
stepped on the carpeted floor cautiously, but soon began to enjoy how 
comfortable the deep shag felt on her bare feet. She was in the middle 
of admiring the silver-framed art prints arranged along the spackled 
wall when a deep, nasal voice spoke up from behind her.

&quot;Hey, whud are yuh doin&#39; h-- ACHOO!&quot; Soi nearly jumped out of her skin 
at the sudden interruption of her thoughts by what she instantly assumed 
was Yoruichi&#39;s father--it sounded way too deep to be a woman&#39;s voice.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, sir! I was just bringing these to...Yoruichi-san?&quot; Soi 
blinked as she turned around, stopping in the middle of her apology once 
she realized that the person behind her was none other than her friend, 
but she nearly didn&#39;t recognize her. Yoruichi&#39;s hair was pooling around 
her shoulders, looking tangled and ratty like it hadn&#39;t been combed in a 
few days. The upperclassman&#39;s eyes were drooping and slightly puffy, and 
to top it all off she was outfitted in a sleepshirt about three sizes 
too big for her and her hand was clutching a wad of unused tissues. 
&quot;Are...are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Doh,&quot; Yoruichi managed as she straightened one of the crumpled-up 
tissues and blew her nose so loudly it echoed in the cavernous room for 
a few seconds. &quot;I&#39;b sig, ob course. Bud how&#39;d jew ged in, Doi?&quot; It took 
Soi a moment to deduce what Yoruichi was saying through her congested 
voice, but after a few seconds the freshman answered.

&quot;Oh, uh, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Soi responded, pointing to the still-open front 
door. &quot;I tried to knock on your door, but you didn&#39;t answer, and when I 
pushed it opened up, so--&quot;

&quot;Id wad open?&quot; The taller girl answered with a feeble attempt at her 
normal look of annoyance. &quot;Goddabit, Kisuke... I tod hib to log up when 
he lebt.&quot; With a few incoherent mutters, Yoruichi hobbled over to the 
door and locked it, shivering as a cold wind blew through at that 
moment.

&quot;Um...Was Urahara-san here?&quot;

&quot;Ehh, obly for a liddle bid yesterday,&quot; Yoruichi responded as she yawned 
and brought herself to a stop on the staircase railing, leaning against 
it in an effort to fight off a sudden surge of fatigue. &quot;He broudt be 
sub stuff frob da store for by code, bud I habbn&#39;t eben looked ad it 
ye--&quot; Yoruichi stopped as a fresh wave of sneezes assaulted her, making 
her double over and grip the staircase harder to avoid falling onto the 
floor. When she was finally able to breathe, she gave an annoyed 
chuckle. &quot;Dy always ged sig around dis tib of year--maybe I&#39;b allerjig 
do domethig...&quot; Soi felt a pang of guilt at seeing Yoruichi so 
miserable--it told her the older girl&#39;s ailment had nothing to do with 
allergies and everything to do with having to run home in the rain after 
relinquishing a certain red umbrella, but she knew that if she asked 
Yoruichi would just deny it. Instead she reached into her bookbag and 
pulled out the papers Matsumoto had employed her to deliver.

&quot;Oh--here are these, they&#39;re from your homeroom teacher...&quot; Yoruichi 
took them half-heartedly, not even looking at them as she set them on 
the foot of the stairs.

&quot;I&#39;ll do dem lader, sorry you haddo cumb oud her just for dat. Hey,&quot; the 
dark-haired woman said with sudden comprehension and a glance at the 
silver-trimmed clock on the wall, &quot;Dond&#39; you hab your tesd in a liddle 
while?&quot; Soi&#39;s eyes drifted down to her watch and widened when she 
realized Yoruichi was right.

&quot;Oh, geez, I need to get going! Bye, Yoruichi-sa--&quot; she stopped about 
three feet from the exit when she heard the unmistakable sound of a 
stomach growling. She turned around to see a very red faced Yoruichi 
turn around and begin to go upstairs.

&quot;Well, I&#39;d bedder ged some sleeb...&quot; Yoruichi began evasively, but Soi&#39;s 
voice cut her off.

&quot;Yoruichi-san...was that you?&quot; The older girl didn&#39;t answer, she simply 
stayed put halfway up the stairs with her back to the petite freshman. 
&quot;...When was the last time you ate?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Yoruichi admitted with a sniffle, &quot;...I habbn&#39;t eaden since 
Weddsday--&quot; Suddenly she heard Soi answer in a surprisingly agitated 
voice.

&quot;...Are you kidding! You know you need to be eating when you&#39;re sick, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Well, I jus&#39; wad drying do sleeb id doff; I&#39;be been do dired do ady 
cooging.&quot; Without warning, Soi climbed the handful of steps and put her 
hand on Yoruichi&#39;s forehead, deep maternal instincts overwhelming the 
young girl&#39;s normal reaction to ignore the problem and mind her own 
business.

&quot;Jeez... you&#39;re burning up...Yoruichi-san?&quot; The older girl blinked and 
didn&#39;t answer; Soi&#39;s extreme proximity, or rather the deep concern she 
was displaying, seemed to be doing something to her already befuddled 
senses. &quot;Oh, here--come back downstairs,&quot; Soi muttered as she put 
Yoruichi&#39;s arm over her shoulders and supported the lethargic girl with 
a hand around the waist, carefully guiding her to the couch and helping 
her sit down. Before Yoruichi could say anything, Soi had already thrown 
her bookbag beside the front door and was running around the living 
room. &quot;Hey, where do you keep extra blankets? You know, pillows, 
linens...?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Yoruichi slowly answered, the sudden change in Soi&#39;s behavior 
frightening her a little, &quot;...dere&#39;s a liddle closid id da next 
room--doh, de udder wud,&quot; she corrected when Soi began to walk in the 
wrong direction. A few seconds later the freshman ran back in, barely 
visible behind an armful of mismatched quilts and a large down pillow. 
Yoruichi instinctively got off the couch to allow Soi a few minutes to 
arrange the couch, and before she knew it she was sitting back onto the 
now-makeshift bed, feeling considerably warmer than she had before. 
&quot;Lissen...You dodn&#39;t need do worry aboud be...&quot; Yoruichi started, but 
the younger girl didn&#39;t seem to want listen.

&quot;Where&#39;s that stuff Urahara-san brought you? Was there medicine in 
there?&quot;

&quot;He...He sed dat dere was sommum dat wud helb...I dink he sed dat it wad 
in da kidchen.&quot; Soi walked into the tiled eating area, too focused on 
looking for anything that would give Urahara&#39;s package away to notice 
its how well-furnished it was.

Oh, wait...here&#39;s a note... she picked up a small piece of paper with 
his name on it, saying simply that the &#39;medicine was in the fridge&#39; and 
that she needed a tall glass. Confused, Soi opened up the nearby 
refrigerator and understood with a groan what the unshaven wonder had 
meant.

You&#39;ve got to be freakin&#39; kidding...

&quot;Wad id it?&quot; The sick upperclassman called from the living room.

&quot;...Eggs and sake,&quot; Soi answered grimly. Even if it was meant as a joke, 
the freshman was finding Urahara&#39;s sense of humor less than enjoyable at 
the moment. &quot;Hey, Yoruichi-san, do you have a telephone?&quot;

&quot;Yeb, in da libing (ACHOO! ACHOO!)...In da libin roob.&quot; Yoruichi watched 
Soi walk determinedly past her to the cordless phone that sat on a 
nearby counter and pick up the reciever. There was silence for a few 
moments as she waited for the call to go through.

&quot;He should still be at work...&quot; The freshman muttered to herself, and as 
soon as Yoruichi realized what the other girl was doing she threw her 
hand out.

&quot;Wade a middit, Doi (sniffle)...You shud jus&#39; go bag da school. Yur 
gudda miss yur test...&quot; Soi stared at her friend for a moment, the 
earnesty in Yoruichi&#39;s golden eyes making her uncertain. Sure, she had 
been looking forward to this all week, but if it hadn&#39;t been for 
Yoruichi she would never have joined the Karate Club in the first place; 
she&#39;d still be a friendless loner whose only source of happiness had 
been the books she&#39;d buried herself in for so long. And since Yoruichi 
wouldn&#39;t be in this position in the first place if it hadn&#39;t been for 
her, there was only one option as far as her sense of honor was 
concerned.

&quot;Hello?&quot; The familiar voice of her father disrupted Soi&#39;s train of 
thought, and when she spoke it was clear and with certainty.

&quot;Hi, Dad--It&#39;s me. ...No, no, I&#39;m all right. Listen, I was just calling 
to let you know that I&#39;m gonna be staying at Yoruichi-san&#39;s tonight. 
...NO, Dad, we won&#39;t be drinking... Well, I&#39;ve got the Karate test in 
the morning, so I&#39;ll probably be home around 10:30 tomorrow, okay? All 
right, I love you, too...B&#39;bye.&quot; Soi hung the phone up and ran to the 
front door, slipping her shoes on as she went. &quot;Well, since Urahara-san 
didn&#39;t bring you anything decent...&quot; the freshman said with a roll of 
the eyes, &quot;...I&#39;m going to the store to get some medicine, all right? 
Oh, and I&#39;ll get you some soup or something, too. Is that okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; To be honest, Yoruichi didn&#39;t really know what to think. This 
somehow felt strange, almost otherworldly, to be treated like this after 
so long. She&#39;d always been self-sufficient, and Kisuke had respected her 
personality in this regard, never forcing her to do anything but 
offering to help if she requested it (which admittedly was never). Yet 
in the blink of an eye Soi was taking care of her as if they were 
sisters. But instead of frustrating her, Yoruichi simply felt grateful, 
something which didn&#39;t come easily to her at all. &quot;...No, dat&#39;s fine...&quot;

&quot;Okay, well, I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes, okay? I think there&#39;s a drug 
store around here somewhere, right? Up by the main road?&quot; Yoruichi 
nodded as Soi headed out the door with a smile, then fell back onto the 
nearby pillow to relax her tired body.

It didn&#39;t hurt that all the fight seemed to go out of her when Soi 
smiled at her like that.</pre>
