Neither Soi or Kisuke said anything as he drove. That suited her just 
fine, since she was too occupied with recovering from the shock of what 
had just happened to her. The evidence of her assault was fairly clear-- 
the two halves of the bottom of her dress pooled around her on the cloth 
carseat, and along with the bruises on her face and the specks of blood 
on her cut lip there was a purple ring where one of her assailants had 
grabbed her just below the shoulder. And while there was no mark from 
being nearly strangled to death, Soi rubbed her throat anyway, still 
feeling like she couldn&#39;t breathe. After a few minutes they pulled up to 
the front door of her house, and still maintaining the silence between 
them unlocked the door and walked inside.

&quot;Oh, is that you, Soi?&quot; the girl&#39;s father called jovially as he walked 
into the entryway. &quot;...I thought you would be home later tha--&quot; his 
greeting disappeared into a horrified silence as his eyes met his little 
girl&#39;s disheveled appearance, and though it normally took him a few 
seconds to cross from the kitchen to the front door he had his arms 
around Soi in the blink of an eye. &quot;Soi! Oh my God, what happened to 
you?!&quot;

&quot;...She was walking home and she got attacked. I don&#39;t know all the 
details, though,&quot; Urahara said simply, before the girl had a chance to 
even open her mouth.

&quot;Oh, dear God...look at your face! How bad is it?&quot;

&quot;Dad, I&#39;m fine...&quot; Soi answered stoically as she tried to slip out of 
her father&#39;s bearhug but the older man refused to let go.

&quot;Did they touch you? It&#39;s okay if you want to tell me, we can call the 
police and they&#39;ll find them...&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m okay...&quot;

&quot;Look, I let me get an icepack for your eye and then you can tell me 
what happened--&quot;

&quot;DAD, I&#39;M FINE!&quot; Soi&#39;s father froze, blinked at the sudden elevation of 
the quiet freshman&#39;s voice, and after a moment Soi visibly relaxed. 
&quot;...I...I&#39;m sorry...I just...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Urahara said as he placed a hand on Soi&#39;s shoulder and 
pulled out the cellphone he kept in his back jeans pocket. &quot;...I already 
called the police and told them to come here; I&#39;m gonna let Yoruichi 
know what&#39;s going on real quick, all right?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;...And how many of them were there?&quot;

&quot;T-three,&quot; Soi answered calmly, even though the presence of a handful of 
policeman was making her feel rather intimidated all over again. The 
officer seemed nice enough, but he spoke so gruffly and with such an air 
of boredom that she had to wonder if they actually cared enough to do 
anything.

&quot;You said before that you were walking down 25th, correct? Why were you 
alone at night?&quot;

&quot;I...I didn&#39;t think anything like this would happen,&quot; the girl said with 
just a bit of an edge to her voice: it seemed like they were trying to 
make HER look responsible for this. &quot;...I was just leaving the dance at 
Rukongai and after a while this tall one with a crew cut came up behind 
me and asked what time it was--&quot; She was interrupted as the front door 
swung open and every face in the room turned to see Yoruichi standing 
there, cheeks red from the cold but sweat running down her face 
regardless. It would have taken nearly an hour to get here from 
Yoruichi&#39;s house, but the fact that barely twenty minutes had passed 
since Kisuke had called meant that she had run the whole way here.

&quot;Excuse me, Miss,&quot; the officer who&#39;d been questioning Soi said in an 
authoritative tone, &quot;...You can&#39;t just barge in here like th--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Kisuke said as he stepped forward. &quot;She&#39;s a friend.&quot; 
Yoruichi was still silent, staring at Soi as if assessing the damage for 
herself. The policeman nodded, even though he occasionally cast the new 
arrival suspicious glances every once in a while-- as if he&#39;d seen her 
somewhere else but couldn&#39;t think of the time and place.

&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; the officer said after a few more questions, running 
over the list of details Soi had given and the three composite sketches 
his partner had made, &quot;...We&#39;ll be on the lookout for the one who ran 
off. We saw the other two lying in the street on our way here and 
there&#39;s a car taking them to the station right now.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; the patriarch of the Fong home said sincerely, 
but they merely tipped their caps and headed out, casting another 
confused look of recollection at Yoruichi as the door shut behind them.

&quot;...Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Kisuke said once the flashing of police lights had 
backed away from the house and had retreated into the darkness. &quot;...I&#39;m 
sure they&#39;ll be able to find the g--&quot; Before he could finish Yoruichi 
crossed the room and without the slightest bit of hesitation punched 
Kisuke straight in the face. Soi and her father both recoiled in 
surprise at the sudden display of violence from Yoruichi, and while the 
punch had certainly made him stagger Kisuke eventually succeeded in 
regaining his equilibrium.

&quot;WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?!?!&quot; Yoruichi snarled as she grabbed the lapels 
of her friend&#39;s shirt. &quot;YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULDN&#39;T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN 
TO HER!&quot;

&quot;Y-Yoruichi, listen-- it wasn&#39;t my fault she decided to go home when she 
did! I just walked in there and she was gone!&quot;

&quot;YOU THINK THAT&#39;S AN EXCU-- OH, GODDAMNIT, I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED! 
TO THINK I TRUSTED HER SAFETY TO Y--&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi-san...really...I&#39;m fine,&quot; Soi interrupted calmly, and to 
Kisuke&#39;s surprise his friend loosed the death grip she had on his shirt. 
&quot;...I should have just waited for the limo to come back. It&#39;s my fault.&quot; 
At these words Yoruichi looked at the freshman, her topaz eyes taking in 
the bruises and the tattered state of her attire. Without thinking about 
it she slowly placed her hands on Soi&#39;s shoulders, squeezing them gently 
but at the same time, tight enough to suggest that she was afraid to let 
go.

&quot;...Don&#39;t say that. Don&#39;t EVER say that. NO ONE has the right to do what 
they did to you. Do you understand me?&quot; In spite of the situation Soi 
felt her insides flutter from both the contact and the subdued intensity 
of the older girl&#39;s gaze on her. It was so strange to see Yoruichi like 
this... like she was scared out of her mind with worry. Soi nodded and 
Yoruichi finally let go, leaving the indent of her fingernails in the 
skin as she backed away. An uncomfortable silence fell for a moment that 
was punctuated by the clamorous ringing of the phone in the kitchen. 
None of them had any intention of leaving Soi, but after a few rings her 
father acquiesced and headed to the kitchen.

&quot;Soi, it&#39;s Isane-chan,&quot; he called after a moment. &quot;She said she was 
worried when she noticed you left the dance, and she wanted to make sure 
you got home okay...&quot;

&quot;Can you tell her, Dad?&quot; Soi asked stoically as she walked up the 
stairs. &quot;...I&#39;m going to change.&quot;

&quot;But Soi--&quot;

&quot;...Please Dad,&quot; Soi said as evenly as she could. &quot;...I don&#39;t feel like 
talking about it anymore. I&#39;m just tired...okay?&quot; When she heard him 
talking into the phone she continued trudging up the stairs, throwing 
herself on the bed when she reached her drafty room. She sighed after a 
moment, as if letting out a breath she&#39;d been holding for the last hour. 
To be honest, she really did feel exhausted, but at the same time she 
knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep for hours. She HAD been able to 
protect herself, but just the thought of how those men had touched 
her... she couldn&#39;t move, didn&#39;t want to; she just lay against the 
pillow in her torn dress and prayed for sleep to be merciful and 
overtake her.

&quot;Hey...mind if I come in?&quot; Yoruichi&#39;s voice inquired from the other side 
of the door while she rapped the wood lightly with her knuckles. Soi 
half wanted to be left alone right now, but knowing Yoruichi she would 
probably just wait outside for her to eventually come out.

&quot;...Sure.&quot; With a creak Yoruichi pushed the door ajar, walking quietly 
over to the bed and, saying nothing, sat on the edge beside where her 
friend&#39;s face was resting. For a moment they were quiet, Yoruichi 
reluctant to speak and Soi too tired to think of anything to say. She 
had nearly nodded off when she felt Yoruichi&#39;s hand running through her 
hair. Normally she would have gone into panic mode from this sort of 
contact from her crush, but somehow it made her feel calm instead-- at 
peace.

&quot;...Soi...&quot; Yoruichi finally whispered, continuing her gentle show of 
affection especially since it was aiding her own jangled nerves, &quot;...did 
they...&quot; Soi wondered for a moment what Yoruichi was asking before 
comprehension hit her and she gave the simple answer.

&quot;...No. I managed to get them off before... before it happened.&quot; 
Yoruichi gave a small chuckle as she began to make slower, more delicate 
explorations of Soi&#39;s thick short hair with the palm of her hand.

&quot;Well... thank God you decided to come to Karate after all.&quot; To her 
satisfaction Soi gave a quiet laugh at the joke, and Yoruichi had to 
pull her eyes away from that delicate smile to hide the softness 
creeping into her features. Even now, with an ugly purple lump on her 
small face, Soi still captivated her, as if telling Yoruichi that Soi&#39;s 
beauty had nothing to do with the way she had happened to look tonight.

&quot;So...You followed me to the dance?&quot; Yoruichi was about to ask what her 
friend was talking about when she suddenly remembered her slip 
downstairs.

&quot;...Look, Soi-- I&#39;m sorry, I was just--&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Yoruichi-san.&quot; The upperclassman was about to go into a lengthy 
apology when the last words she expected to hear right now came out of 
Soi&#39;s mouth. What Soi couldn&#39;t say was how glad it made her to know that 
Yoruichi would have come to something she abhorred for HER sake. &quot;I just 
wish... I wish I hadn&#39;t lost it.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Lost what?&quot;

&quot;...Mom&#39;s necklace,&quot; Soi whispered remorsefully as she shifted over (not 
enough that Yoruichi&#39;s hand had to leave her head) to reveal bare skin 
where the jewelry had been before. &quot;One of them grabbed me when I tried 
to get away, and then...&quot;

&quot;...Who cares about that?&quot; Yoruichi said seriously even though she knew 
how precious the stone was to Soi. &quot;The important thing is that you&#39;re 
safe. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what your Mom would rather have anyway.&quot;

I know it&#39;s what I&#39;D rather have, she thought idly as she scooted closer 
to Soi. The freshman eventually nodded, resting her head back on the 
mattress and finally slipping into a much more peaceful slumber than she 
would have expected. Yoruichi knew that Soi hadn&#39;t suffered irreperable 
pain, but seeing her friend like that didn&#39;t fail to light a violent 
fire within her. It didn&#39;t matter if the police were searching for the 
guy who&#39;d run; he would probably leave town, maybe the whole prefecture 
before he could be caught up with. Yoruichi didn&#39;t care what had to be 
done, how far she needed to go. No one had the right to treat Soi like 
that, to even lay a finger on her.

She wanted to find whoever was responsible for doing this and make them 
pay for it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

By Monday the swelling on Soi&#39;s face had receded, mainly due to a diet 
of painkillers and icepacks that her father had prescribed. She didn&#39;t 
have to worry about the bruise on her arm since the uniform covered that 
up, and Yoruichi had found some make-up that matched her skin enough to 
serve as camouflage for the marks on her face. Even so, when she walked 
through the doors of the school she was surprised to find that nothing 
was known in detail about the attack. They had heard vague reports from 
the news but since Soi and her father had requested that the police not 
give out any information about them the victim had remained anonymous.

&quot;...Think I should keep an eye on her?&quot; Kisuke asked as he and Yoruichi 
watched Soi wave them goodbye in the hallway. &quot;I mean, odds are someone 
here knows about whoever attacked her...&quot;

&quot;You think I haven&#39;t already tried that?&quot; Yoruichi asked with a light 
scoff, turning to climb the nearby stairs. &quot;...She said she didn&#39;t wanna 
be &#39;shadowed&#39; again today.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. I swear,&quot; the blonde said while he grinned for the first time in 
a few days. &quot;That girl&#39;s somethin&#39; else, for a kid.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yoruichi said quietly. &quot;...She really is.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;...Well, I guess that&#39;s the end of class,&quot; Aizen said with a bit of 
surprise as the bell rang, staring remorsefully at the blackboard full 
of practice equations and still not anywhere near finished on his 
explanation of the process. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll have to cut the homework for 
tonight a little short. I know you&#39;re disappointed--&quot; he grinned as the 
class raised a cheer, then motioned for them to remain in their seats 
for a moment longer, &quot;...But if you just remember to do 11-43 on pages 
211-213 that&#39;ll be enough until tomorrow, okay? Dismissed.&quot; As if they 
were sitting on springs the class instantly got up, talking amongst 
themselves while they headed to lockers to retrieve books in preparation 
for the next class or else to find friends for lunch.

&quot;Man, THAT&#39;S gonna be a load off,&quot; Kuukaku said with relief as they 
filed out slowly. &quot;...I&#39;m already swamped for tonight from my MORNING 
classes, for God&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re gonna do it anyway...&quot; Yoruichi smirked 
at her friend.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s an unfair assumption--&quot;

&quot;Oh, Miss Shihouin,&quot; Aizen interrupted the girls as they passed his 
desk, &quot;...I&#39;d like to see you for a moment, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; Yoruichi 
and Kuukaku gave each other confused looks before the former stepped out 
of line and told Kuukaku she&#39;d see her in the cafeteria. Once the class 
stepped out and Aizen had gone about the task of assembling the papers 
he&#39;d collected from them she spoke up.

&quot;So...What did you want, Aiz-...Aizen-sensei?&quot; she finished grudgingly.

&quot;Oh, not much...a student turned in one of your books earlier today and 
I wanted to get it back to you. Here, let me get it out of the 
closet...&quot; Aizen turned around to the small room behind him full of 
extra textbooks and boxes of chalk, digging through it as if he&#39;d 
forgotten where he&#39;d placed the thing. Yoruichi sighed, lamenting the 
impending absence of decent sandwiches and eager to see if Soi was doing 
all right when the half-folded paper on the math teacher&#39;s desk caught 
her eye. It was in the middle of the Local News section, a minor story 
due to scant details and few pictures but there it was; a brief story 
about the punks who&#39;d attacked Soi over the weekend. She casually 
brought the paper towards her, twisting it rightside up to get a better 
look at the photos of the two who&#39;d been caught. They were pretty much 
as Soi had described, but below them, wedged between a column of text, 
sat another picture; a sketch of what the caption stated was a tattoo 
the two of them had in common, and vaguely suggesting that they were 
part of a small-time gang. Slowly, Yoruichi&#39;s eyes widened, recognition 
hitting her as she stared at that simple design, at the only other 
person she&#39;d seen with that tattoo...

&quot;Here it is! You&#39;re taking Japanese history, correct?&quot; He held the 
textbook out with her name printed along the side, but Yoruichi said 
nothing. &quot;...Miss Shihouin, is something-- oh... you&#39;re reading about 
that attack?&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah...&quot; Yoruichi muttered as she took her lost History book back, 
not even aware of the weight now straining against her unprepared arm.

&quot;Terrible, isn&#39;t it? And they say it was someone at OUR school who did 
it, too...though they don&#39;t look like they&#39;d be smart enough to pull 
something like that off on their own...&quot;

&quot;...No...they don&#39;t...L-listen,&quot; Yoruichi managed, the energy drained 
from her eyes as she reflexively hitched the book up under her arm. 
&quot;Thank you, Aizen-sensei, but...I really need to be going...&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes! I&#39;m sorry about that-- your friends are probably waiting for 
you, aren&#39;t they? Well, go on, I won&#39;t hold you back any longer...&quot; He 
shooed Yoruichi out with a wave and a friendly smile, which melted into 
a more malevolent glare once she turned the corner. The newspaper had 
done the hard part for him, and now all he needed was for Yoruichi to 
dig her own grave.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoruichi&#39;s fist clenched and unclenched as she felt her feet carry her 
to the cafeteria; she felt a bit like she&#39;d been possessed, as if her 
body was acting without her brain&#39;s commands. She couldn&#39;t believe it 
could possibly be so simple, that he would have even tried to pull 
something like this off, and to SOI, who she&#39;d explicitly warned him to 
stay away from. But if it was to be someone, why wouldn&#39;t it have been 
him? Why couldn&#39;t she have known better than to even give him the 
benefit of the doubt? But she had to be sure. If she saw him...she had 
to be certain that she had seen that mark on him before she did 
anything.

&quot;Hey, Yoruichi!&quot; Kisuke called, putting down his bowl of ramen while Soi 
followed suit with her homemade salad. The freshman opened her mouth to 
greet her paramour but was halted when she saw the coldness with which 
Yoruichi greeted them, sitting down with a plop. The two prior occupants 
of the table glanced at Yoruichi curiously, at the pensive look on her 
face, and while Urahara was more than prepared to let this sleeping dog 
lie Soi glanced at her with concern.

&quot;...Yoruichi-san...Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the older girl blinked, forcing herself to relax as she tried to 
keep her friend reassured. &quot;...No, I was just thinking about my 
homework, is all...&quot; She grabbed one of the napkins sitting in the 
table&#39;s center and began to occupy her hands with it, folding it 
absentmindedly and feeling far too queasy to even consider eating at 
this point. They were silent for a while, sensing Yoruichi&#39;s unease, 
until the upperclassman noticed a flash of short gray hair walk into the 
nearby boy&#39;s bathroom.

He&#39;ll be alone, she thought to herself. But... she nearly stopped 
herself before she glanced at Soi, at the slight blotch of purple still 
visible beneath layers of make-up, before logic abandoned her entirely. 
He didn&#39;t deserve even the slightest bit of mercy from her. None.

&quot;...Excuse me,&quot; Yoruichi said hurriedly as she got up. &quot;...Little girl&#39;s 
room, you know...&quot; Soi glanced at her friend for a moment while Kisuke 
nodded, then turned back to her meal just as she walked through the door 
beside her stated destination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gin sighed as he washed his hands off, letting the warm water run over 
his knuckles and converge again when it hit the sink basin. He pulled 
the handle of the paper towel dispenser a few times absentmindedly 
before he noticed it, a pair of dark legs peeking out from beneath a 
pitch-black knee-length skirt.

&quot;Hey, girly, this&#39;s th&#39; guy&#39;s room. Can&#39;t ya r--&quot;

&quot;I told you to leave her ALONE, Ichimaru.&quot;

At that, Gin looked over to actually see who was there; Yoruichi was 
only a few feet away from him, one of her palms coiled into a fist and 
her goldenrod eyes illuminated with fury. He flinched slightly at the 
degree of anger he felt emanating from her, but uncertain as to why he 
merely gave her a disinterested grin.

&quot;What&#39;re ya talkin about, Shihouin?&quot; Without another word Yoruichi 
stomped over to him and grabbed the sleeve of his right arm, pushing it 
back to his elbow. There it sat: the tattoo of an elongated diamond with 
the Japanese character for &#39;3&#39; within its borders. That was also the 
last intelligible thing she registered before she placed her other hand 
on his wrist and broke it brutal efficiency. Gin&#39;s eyes widened, he 
threatened to scream out but Yoruichi smashed her fist into his face, 
breaking his nose with even less effort.

&quot;...You worthless fucking bastard...&quot; Yoruichi whispered, though it bore 
as much power and loathing as if she&#39;d screamed it. Gin looked up, 
hoping that there was some semblance of reason in Yoruichi&#39;s unprovoked 
actions but she seemed well beyond the reaches of human compassion at 
this point. In fact, she almost looked like she was enjoying this; there 
wasn&#39;t even the slightest hint of a smile on her face but her eyes gave 
her satisfaction away.

&quot;What the...hell&#39;re you doin?!&quot; Gin growled, not willing to show 
weakness even though he knew full well what she was capable of. &quot;I don&#39; 
know nothin&#39; abou--&quot; He was silenced by his own scream as Yoruichi, 
who&#39;d by now grasped his other hand, snapped his index finger with her 
thumb. Then another, and immediately afterward his pinky finger was 
hanging limply on his hand.

&quot;I don&#39;t care if you admit it to me or not,&quot; she whispered in a voice 
like ice, sending a chill down her prey&#39;s spine as she clutched his face 
and slammed it into the side of one of the sinks, leaving the stain of 
blood from his broken nose there and sending another spray of the stuff 
onto the immaculate tile floor. &quot;...I don&#39;t even care if I get caught. 
But I will NEVER let ANYONE touch a hair on her head again.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Oh, there you were!&quot; Urahara grinned as Kuukaku waved them a greeting, 
then sat down with her lunch. &quot;We were starting to think you&#39;d gotten 
lost.&quot;

&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; the snarky girl answered with just as much sarcasm. &quot;Just let 
me eat in peace...Hey, where&#39;s Yoruichi?&quot;

&quot;...She went to the bathroom,&quot; Soi answered, setting her fork down in 
the remainders of spinach and carrots.

&quot;Are you sure? I was just there-- didn&#39;t see her at all.&quot; At this 
information Urahara blinked, certain he&#39;d seen her go in one of the 
doors but shrugged his shoulders regardless.

&quot;Oh well. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll come back in a few min--&quot;

&quot;Hey everyone! There&#39;s a fight in the boy&#39;s bathroom!&quot; As fast as 
everyone in the cafeteria headed for the washroom as the anonymous boy 
ran out, Kisuke and Kuukaku were still the first to reach the threshold, 
with a bewildered Soi Fong bringing up the rear.

&quot;Hey! Guys, do you know someth...&quot; Soi yelled while forcing her way 
through the crowd and through the narrow opening, but her voice 
disappeared once her eyes met with the bathroom. Blood was smeared 
across the floors before the sinks, like some macabre take on an 
abstract painting, and Yoruichi herself was there, kneeling over someone 
she eventually realized was Ichimaru, his face unrecognizible due to 
being covered in red and Yoruichi&#39;s continual efforts to smash his face 
into the tile. While all she could do was stand there, horrified by what 
her sempai was doing, Kisuke ran forward, clutching at her waist and 
pulling her back.

&quot;Yoruichi, stop it! You&#39;ll kill him!&quot; Within moments she knocked him off 
her like he was a child three times smaller as opposed to a man twice 
her weight, and began beating Gin anew as if that very ends was what she 
had intended. She seemed utterly beyond reason now, like a demon 
unrestrained, and before he could make a concerted attempt to pull her 
off with Kuukaku the sound of knuckles colliding with bone suddenly 
stopped.

Yoruichi blinked to find Soi leaning against her, holding her arm back 
in midswing with all her might. She turned her angry eyes at Soi, as if 
trying to tell her through them why she was doing this, that she needed 
to punish him further. She could only stare at Soi&#39;s eyes, gentle and 
pleading as she leaned against her, for a moment before her fist relaxed 
and she let it fall to her side. She gasped for breath as she got up, 
her blind rage subsided to the point where she didn&#39;t even feel 
compelled to kick the cringing boy as Soi guided her away from the 
bloodied room.

&quot;Excuse me! What&#39;s the meaning of th-- Miss Shihouin!&quot; Soi blinked to 
find a teacher standing at the edge of the crowd, a man who briefly 
reminded her of Uryuu except that he had platinum hair instead of jet 
black. &quot;...Come with me,&quot; he said as he reached for her and the mass of 
students instantly split, as if afraid that the young woman covered in 
Ichimaru&#39;s blood would turn on them and do the same. He pulled her with 
such force that Yoruichi was extricated from Soi&#39;s grip, and was halfway 
across the empty dining area when he turned around, logic replacing his 
hasteful shock. &quot;...Someone take that boy to Unohana-san. And you two--&quot; 
he indicated Soi and Kisuke with a slight wave of his hand, &quot;...follow 
me. We&#39;ll need you for witnesses when we talk to the Principal.&quot;

&quot;Urahara-san...&quot; Soi whispered as they walked away from the shocked 
people, Kuukaku having taken it upon herself to retrieve Gin, &quot;...What&#39;s 
going to happen to Yoruichi-san? I&#39;ve never seen her like that 
before...&quot;

&quot;I have,&quot; Kisuke answered simply, staring at his friend as she followed 
Ishida-sensei into the north end of the building. &quot;...But it&#39;s been a 
long time since she did something like this.&quot;

Soi tried to ask what he meant by that, but before she could get the 
words out the blonde increased his pace, forcing her to do all that she 
could to keep up with him.</pre>
