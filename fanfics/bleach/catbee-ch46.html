Soi heaved a sigh as she turned her final in, feeling no better about 
her essay section regardless of the fact that she&#39;d triple-checked 
spelling and facts. Most of her classmates had already left for the day, 
making her feel a little more self-conscious about how successful she&#39;d 
been, but after a while the freshman sighed, expelling her anxiety as 
she tried to prepare herself for a whole day of freedom that would 
normally be reserved for school. She heard a few stragglers that she 
passed by talking about summer break already, their plans to work or 
take a family trip or else fretting about the next set of tests 
tomorrow. As she stood at her locker putting books away, she caught a 
hint of dark hair and recently-smoked cigarettes, and gave a smile upon 
turning to find the Shiba girl hovering over her.

&quot;Kuukaku! How are you?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t complain, I guess,&quot; Kuukaku lied, still deciding whether or not 
she wanted to go ahead with this. She hated Yoruichi for putting her in 
this position, but if it ended up making Soi happy then it was probably 
for the best. &quot;Hey, Yoruichi wanted to know if you could come over on 
Friday.&quot; It took Soi a moment to process the request; she hadn&#39;t seen 
Yoruichi since they&#39;d &#39;met&#39; on the stairs a while back, not even in the 
company of Urahara. To be honest, it was easier for her to deal with 
things that way, when Yoruichi was out of sight and out of mind, and 
though she&#39;d never really strayed from her thoughts altogether it had 
helped her to keep up her mask. Soi hoped that she didn&#39;t 
sound...emotional... when she replied.

&quot;Wh-what does she want me for?&quot;

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t tell me,&quot; Kuukaku answered, deciding only to tell the girl 
a half-truth. &quot;Go see her on Friday. She said it was important.&quot;

&quot;...Why couldn&#39;t she tell me herself?&quot; the freshman queried, a bit put 
off at being treated as though she wasn&#39;t worthy of being spoken to 
directly.

&quot;She&#39;s busy helping Kisuke move his stuff into her house. Not like 
THAT,&quot; Kuukaku corrected as she caught the suspicious look on Soi&#39;s face 
at the statement. &quot;...He&#39;s just going to stay there while she&#39;s away. 
You know, keep the house safe.&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; the older girl whispered, leaning in towards her, &quot;...I 
heard that things aren&#39;t working out between them.&quot;

&quot;Wh...What do you mean by--&quot;

&quot;Later,&quot; Kuukaku said with a wave as she walked off, Soi wondering just 
what she&#39;d been implying in that statement. But she shook her head, 
cursing herself for allowing to get even a little optimistic. She 
couldn&#39;t help wondering what Yoruichi could want to talk to her about, 
and though she had a rather hopeful idea she brushed it away with a sad 
sort of laugh, certain that it would never happen.

----------

&quot;Well, it looks like you&#39;ve got a couple days,&quot; Kuukaku muttered as she 
walked alongside the dark-skinned senior, her relatively empty bookcase 
swinging freely back and forth in the slight wind. Yoruichi nodded, deep 
in thought until her friend spoke again. &quot;...I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re not 
just going up to the kid yourself. She DESERVES to know after the way 
you treated her.&quot;

&quot;You think I don&#39;t know that?&quot; Yoruichi grumbled, her eyes flitting 
around to the sidewalk and at the perfect rows of houses they passed. As 
much as it had been difficult to ignore her feelings before, it was 
almost unbearable now that she understood what was going on in her own 
head, that her affection for Soi wasn&#39;t something she needed or even 
should be hiding. But she had to do this right, had to think about what 
she would say, if she should gradually bring this up in a way that would 
make Soi comfortable. She&#39;d already started going over scenarios in her 
head, ways to catch Soi off guard, maybe get her to reveal that she 
still cared about her instead of all the weight being put on her.

It didn&#39;t help that time was running out-- her plane was leaving early 
Tuesday, the day after graduation. To be honest, part of her was still 
wanting to keep this a secret, hoping it would fade eventually when she 
left. But she had been evasive too long. She needed to tell her the 
truth, if only so Soi would know that her feelings weren&#39;t wasted.

----------

There was a knock on her door a few hours after classes, and finals, had 
ended on the day before the weekend. Yoruichi took a breath, steeling 
herself for what she knew was coming, then let it out as she allowed Soi 
entrance. She&#39;d almost forgotten that ache in the pit of her stomach 
until she&#39;d come face-to-face with Soi again, but fortunately she 
recovered before the freshman even noticed.

&quot;Hi, Yoruichi-san!&quot; The older of the two smiled back, not showing the 
slight sting at being called by that formal title again. &quot;Um... Kuukaku 
said you needed to see me?&quot;

&quot;Oh... yeah. Soi, I just...&quot; Yoruichi tried to remain calm but all the 
plans and strategies she&#39;d thought up on how to deal with this flew out 
the window, leaving her like an explorer without a compass. All she was 
aware of was how badly she wanted to hold the girl in front of her, the 
gnawing want in her chest as her heartstrings twinged. She wasn&#39;t ready 
to go into this now-- she felt too disoriented after seeing Soi again to 
put her thoughts together. &quot;...I was wondering if you could help me move 
some things up to the attic? I&#39;m afraid Kisuke won&#39;t have much use for 
them anyway.&quot;

Soi felt a little annoyed now-- that after all this Yoruichi would call 
her just as cheap labor-- but since she was already here, and since she 
had something for Yoruichi anyway, she nodded and followed as the older 
girl lead the way to the living room.

Though she now had a few more hours to think, Yoruichi felt even more 
stifled by the utter silence that filled the house now. Soi was almost 
treating her like a stranger, not speaking unless it was to ask where a 
box would be best suited or offering a hand when she was carrying a 
rather awkward-looking chest of drawers. She felt Soi&#39;s hand brush hers 
and the electric shock that followed, its newfound potency over her 
equalled only by its seeming lack of effect on the freshman.

&quot;Man, that was heavy!&quot; Soi groaned as they sat in the kitchen, drinking 
from a small store-bought carton of lemonade, Yoruichi ignoring the milk 
for once to do the same. &quot;I thought you weren&#39;t the type to keep useless 
crap around the house, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

&quot;Well... most of it belonged to my parents. I just never bothered to 
move it before now.&quot; Soi nodded, and the kitchen again became still. It 
was hard to believe that the space of the table between them was only a 
few feet; to Yoruichi it may as well have been a mile for all her 
hesitance. This small talk-- trying to pretend that she was just trying 
to keep things friendly between her and Soi-- was killing her. She 
wanted to reach across and touch her, wanted to hold Soi in her arms and 
never let go again, to feel the warmth of that small frame pressed 
against her own. It struck her suddenly how cruel this must have been on 
Soi, suffering alone with her presumedly unrequited feelings long before 
they&#39;d come to this.

&quot;Yoruichi-san, could I ask you something?&quot; Soi asked out of the blue.

&quot;Huh? Oh, sure...&quot;

&quot;...Is it true that you and Urahara-san are having...problems?&quot; The 
freshman winced once the question had escaped her lips, aware that it 
was a rather personal inquiry just as she was baffled by WHY she would 
have asked in the first place.

&quot;...Actually... we broke up last week.&quot; Soi felt a strange thrill run 
through her at the news, instantly hating herself for such a feeling of 
ecstacy. Did Yoruichi still have that much of a hold on her that she 
believed... No. Not anymore. She had been a fool, and Yoruichi had 
thrown him away just like her. A Goddess couldn&#39;t love, she thought 
darkly. They only had servants. Toys.

&quot;Oh. ...I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t work out.&quot;

&quot;No. It wasn&#39;t really right for either of us. I had...&quot; Yoruichi glanced 
directly at her before trailing off, the Chinese girl feeling a spark at 
the look; it made her wonder just what Yoruichi &#39;had&#39; that would have 
made her break up with Kisuke so suddenly. She ignored the small flame 
of hope that stubbornly kept flaring up inside her.

&quot;Um... is there anything else we left in the other room?&quot; Soi spoke up, 
eager to change the subject.

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay-- it&#39;s mostly smaller boxes. I can get them myself.&quot;

&quot;Hey, didn&#39;t you want to talk to me about something?&quot; Yoruichi paused, 
glanced into her glass, pretending that she was avoiding Soi&#39;s 
questioning gaze to take interest in the half-melted ice cubes floating 
in her drink.

&quot;Oh, uh... It&#39;s funny, I forgot.&quot; She gave a little chuckle as if it had 
been no big deal, which she was grateful Soi bought, heading for the 
door. As she slipped on her shoes Soi made a little gasp of 
recollection, then began searching through her bookcase until she found 
a sealed envelope.

&quot;Ah, I almost spaced it-- Yoruichi-san, this is for you. I figured it 
was better to give it to you now then to forget later.&quot;

The upperclassman stared at the nondescript envelope, hesitant to take 
it at first. Had she done something recently that warranted a gift, 
especially one from Soi?

&quot;Um... what is it?&quot;

&quot;Well, a few things,&quot; Soi admitted with an embarrassed smile, unaware 
that she&#39;d just made Yoruichi&#39;s pulse race a little faster. &quot;...Sort of 
a &#39;graduation/going away/thank you&#39; present. It&#39;s just... my gratitude 
for you looking out for me this year.&quot; Yoruichi glanced at the gift, 
unsure of what to say or if she should refuse it, when she looked up to 
find Soi already waving goodbye from beyond the doorway.

----------

She wasn&#39;t sure why she waited-- perhaps it was the creeping dread that 
by opening it she was saying goodbye to the freshman forever-- but an 
hour later Yoruichi finally tore a hole along the top, pulling out a 
store-bought card and a smaller square of folded paper, bulging slightly 
at its center and surprisingly heavy. Setting the square aside for the 
time being she read the front of the card. She wasn&#39;t sure what she&#39;d 
been expecting, but a mass-produced message of &#39;congratulations&#39; hadn&#39;t 
been it; it was almost as depressing as the handful of American 20 
dollar bills inside. Had she come to mean so little to Soi now that she 
could give such a... meaningless thing to her? She had no need of money, 
but at least it might pay for a meal out or at the movies between her 
classes once she reached the U.S.

It didn&#39;t mean anything, but what could she expect? She had no right to 
deny that something so superficial suited her. Any hopes that the 
smaller package would make her feel better were instantly obliterated 
the second she unfolded the paper and saw a flash of ruby and silver 
land on the table with a clink. The necklace, the one she&#39;d given Soi to 
replace the destroyed one of her mother&#39;s. It felt like a shot directly 
through her heart, so much so that she didn&#39;t notice at first that on 
the paper was written a note, in Soi&#39;s tiny and meticulous writing.

Yoruichi-san,
I know this may seem strange, but I wanted to return this to you before 
you left. I appreciate the gesture, but the truth is that my mother&#39;s is 
gone. It was silly of me to keep it so long, like I could somehow keep 
her alive while I wore it. But I think now I can let it go, let her find 
peace so that she won&#39;t always be worrying about me. I&#39;m sure that this 
cost you a small fortune, so please don&#39;t hesitate to get it sold once 
you reach America. I&#39;m sure that you could use the cash-- things are 
pretty expensive from what I&#39;ve heard. Please take care of yourself.

-Soi

Yoruichi read the note again and then a third time, unaware of how 
violently her hands were shaking, how deeply those words shook the very 
core of her. It had never been to replace Soi&#39;s mother, Yoruichi 
realized. It had just been for her, because she&#39;d looked so happy when 
she&#39;d seen it again, because it looked so beautiful hanging from her 
neck, because deep down she&#39;d known she&#39;d gladly spend every last Yen 
she had if it made Soi smile. Without another thought she grabbed the 
necklace and ran for the door.

----------

&quot;I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m coming,&quot; the freshman insisted as she set the dishes 
from her microwaved dinner in the sink. She wished her father wasn&#39;t 
working late again tonight-- he knew how to deal with late-afternoon 
salesman better than she did. &quot;I wish you people would just leave us 
alo--&quot;

Yoruichi was on the front step, barely an inch from her, shoulders 
heaving as she struggled to breath after clearly having run the whole 
way. For a while she just stood there, trying to slow the pounding of 
her heart even after she&#39;d lessened her huffing and puffing.

&quot;Yoruichi-san, are you all right?&quot;

No. She&#39;d NEVER been all right-- just believed that it was normal to go 
through life, feeling only the slightest and most obligatory of 
emotions. But never this-- this flood that overwhelmed her, threatened 
to sweep her under and drown her as she held the necklace in her hand 
tighter, like a life preserver. But it wouldn&#39;t hold her forever, didn&#39;t 
offer any real shelter.

&quot;Um... I can get you some water and we can talk if there&#39;s something 
bothering you...&quot;

She&#39;d been so afraid of this-- of surrendering that last inch of herself 
completely to these feelings-- that it seemed so pointless now to fight 
it, to even pretend that there was a wall protecting her that Soi hadn&#39;t 
already shattered.

Soi was getting worried, confused by the look in Yoruichi&#39;s eyes... so 
vulnerable, so passionate and almost helpless that for a minute it 
didn&#39;t seem like her at all.

&quot;Please... tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

With that, Yoruichi let the flood take her away.

The freshman tried to speak again only to find herself crushed against 
Yoruichi, a shocked gasp escaping her lips as strong cocoa arms wrapped 
around her, holding her so tightly that she feared she couldn&#39;t breathe. 
Soi tried to think, to process this sudden change in behavior but only 
felt the older girl&#39;s gasping chest on her own, a cheek pressed hard 
against her hair.

Yoruichi shuddered in spite of herself. She couldn&#39;t believe that she&#39;d 
denied herself this warmth, this utter euphoria for so long. She let her 
fingertips become reacquainted with Soi, the desire to melt into her and 
never be seperate again taking precedence over everything else in her 
mind.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi--&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Soi felt the world stop turning at that moment, her heart pause 
completely. The senior realized what she had said but felt no shame, the 
words she&#39;d been holding back so long now tumbling out with glorious 
abandon. She ran a hand through Soi&#39;s short hair, savoring the silken 
texture against her hand. Finally Soi&#39;s shock became too much, and 
speech escaped her lips.

&quot;...What?&quot;

Yoruichi wanted only to repeat it now, to shout it to the world, to 
herself, to the stars themselves that she worshipped this girl, a girl 
who no one else could see the way she did. But this time, she decided to 
only speak loud enough for Soi to hear.

&quot;...I love you, Soi.&quot;</pre>
