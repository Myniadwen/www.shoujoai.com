&quot;Here--I hope it&#39;s not too bad...&quot; Yoruichi stirred out of her listless 
state of half-sleep at the sound of Soi Fong&#39;s voice and the aroma of 
hot soup. The upperclassman groaned a few times as she pulled herself 
into a sitting position on the couch, then without even bothering to 
make an attempt to open her drooping eyes, accepted the meal with 
outstretched hands and a few incoherent mumbles. &quot;Honestly,&quot; Soi said 
with a roll of the eyes as she watched her friend move as though she was 
making her way through a purple haze, &quot;...You&#39;d think that someone YOUR 
age would be able to know how to deal with a cold.&quot;

&quot;...Well...&quot; the older girl managed once she&#39;d allowed the warmth of the 
soup to wake her up a bit, &quot;...Dy&#39;m surbised dew doh soh buch aboud dis, 
Doi...&quot; The freshman only shrugged her shoulders, as if doing so could 
account for her wealth of knowledge on the subject of minor sicknesses.

&quot;Well, you know...I was sick a lot when I was a kid, and my parents 
would always do the same things whenever I came down with a fever or 
whatever-- make me lay down, stay warm, drink lots of fluids, eat, that 
sort of thing. I guess I just kinda picked it up after a while,&quot; Soi 
finished with a slightly reminiscent chuckle. When she noticed that 
Yoruichi was in danger of nodding off and spilling her soup all over the 
floor, she tapped her friend on the shoulder, making Yoruichi&#39;s sagging 
head jerk up. &quot;Yoruichi-san, you need to eat...&quot; After a few moments, 
Yoruichi scooped up some of the noodle soup with a provided spoon, then 
gulped it down once she had blown on it to the point where it had no 
danger of burning her tongue.

&quot;Hey...&quot; Yoruichi said quietly once she had allowed her first bit of 
food to go down her throat, sounding slightly better already, &quot;...Dat 
stub&#39;s preddy good. Dy&#39;m glad you&#39;re bedder dan your Dad,&quot; she added 
with a spirited attempt at her trademark mischevious smile. Soi grinned 
back nervously, deciding that this probably wasn&#39;t a good time to tell 
Yoruichi that the only reason the soup tasted remotely edible was 
because the instructions on the back of the can were so simple.

&quot;Well, if you&#39;re gonna be okay, then I&#39;ll go eat in the kitchen...&quot; Soi 
began as she headed in that direction, but Yoruichi stopped her with a 
wave of the hand.

&quot;Dey, by do&#39;d you gome dit in here? Dere&#39;s blenny of seeds,&quot; the 
upperclassman said through a sniffle as she pointed out the handful of 
varied chairs scattered around the living room. Soi hesitated for a 
moment, about to contend that she didn&#39;t want to run the risk of getting 
sick from being too near Yoruichi, but then she considered that if she 
hadn&#39;t already caught something by now, then she had nothing to worry 
about for the rest of the night.

&quot;...Okay.&quot; the younger girl gave a slight nod, then headed for the 
kitchen to grab another bowl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A half-hour later, Soi set down her now-empty dish on the carpet, being 
careful to put it somewhere that she wouldn&#39;t knock it over with an 
errant foot. She glanced over at Yoruichi, who was watching the 
television set flickering in the epicenter of the room with only half 
her attention. Occasionally she would let out a slight laugh if she saw 
something particularly amusing, but otherwise she simply focused on her 
soup, taking liberal gulps of water in between spoonfuls. It took Soi a 
moment to realize that she was staring at her friend with surprising 
intensity, but she suceeded in snapping herself out of her trance with a 
shake of the head.

I must be more worried than I thought, Soi considered quietly as, with 
surprising reluctance, she turned her attention to the television. It 
seemed like only a few minutes had passed when Soi heard a loud yawn 
come from the direction of her friend. She turned her head slightly to 
see Yoruichi set down her bowl, lazily sloshing some of the soup onto 
the carpet.

&quot;Hey--are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Doh, yeah...I&#39;b fide,&quot; Yoruichi answered after another yawn 
interrupted her. &quot;Id&#39;s jus dat duh medidine made be dired, is all...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the freshman apologized as she walked over to where 
Yoruichi had set her dish, then stacked it atop her own bowl and walked 
toward the kitchen. &quot;...I should&#39;ve gotten the non-drowsy stuff. I just 
grabbed the first thing I could--&quot; Yoruichi cut off her younger 
companion with a nod of the head.

&quot;Dit&#39;s all ride, Doi. Do be honesd... Dy habben&#39;d been sleebing well dis 
weeg, so...&quot;

&quot;What! I thought you said you&#39;d been sleeping it off!&quot; Soi answered with 
a bit of annoyance from the kitchen, her frustration not visible to the 
sick girl lazily watching TV from the couch. She gave a loud sigh, then 
walked in with a fresh glass of water for Yoruichi, who took it 
gratefully as her current drink was empty. &quot;Jeez, were you just planning 
to stay out of school for as long as you could!&quot; Yoruichi gave a stuffy 
chuckle but no denial as Soi absentmindedly plopped down on the couch 
beside her. &quot;I swear...&quot; the Chinese girl began, but was violently 
knocked off her train of thought when she felt something heavy plop into 
her lap. She blinked when she realized it was Yoruichi&#39;s head, then 
barely succeeded in collecting her thoughts enough to protest.

&quot;W-what the...? Hey! D-don&#39;t lay on top of me!&quot;

&quot;...S...(yawn)...sorry...&quot; Yoruichi tiredly droned to her friend as she 
unconsciously shifted her position on the couch, not noticing that Soi&#39;s 
face was twice as red as hers was, but for an entirely different reason. 
&quot;Dy...Dy&#39;ll mobe in a few middides. I dold dew dy wad dired...&quot;

&quot;Y-you&#39;ve got a perfectly good pillow on the other side of the couch,&quot; 
Soi complained even as something deep in her gut told her not to put up 
a fuss.

&quot;Ahh...Id&#39;s nod berry comfy,&quot; Yoruichi answered with a teasing smile and 
a coy voice that came out sounding more like the mumbling of an elephant 
than a beautiful young woman. The statement itself had the desired 
effect of rendering Soi Fong speechless however, and the younger girl 
sighed in defeat even as she pushed aside a sudden feeling of ecstacy. 
For a while the two girls stayed that way, their eyes on the television 
but neither paying it any attention--Soi was feeling self-conscious 
about having her friend so close, while Yoruichi was just struggling to 
remain cognizant, since her current position was a comfortable one. She 
was so comfortable, in fact, that Yoruichi had slowly become aware of 
the clean, freshly-laundered scent of Soi&#39;s jeans, and in a last ditch 
effort to get her mind off the thoughts spontaneously filling her head 
she looked up and noticed the glitter of a chain on her friend&#39;s neck.

&quot;Hey, Doi...&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi mumbled after a moment, pulling herself back to the 
present. &quot;Do you need something, Yoruichi-san?&quot; It took Yoruichi a 
little longer to answer then she normally would have; she hadn&#39;t been 
close enough before to see the color of Soi Fong&#39;s eyes that was now as 
clear as day-- a blend of silver and gray, something like a sky-full of 
clouds ready to burst into a storm. Her pause was brief enough that Soi 
didn&#39;t notice it, however.

&quot;...Cad dy see dat ding? ...Da wod od yer deck,&quot; she clarified when Soi 
only gave her a perplexed expression in response.

&quot;Oh--sure,&quot; the freshman assented (with a bit of hesitancy) as she 
reached below the collar of her plain white blouse and pulled out the 
jewelry that Yoruichi greeted with a slight sigh of recollection.

&quot;Hey...Dy remebber dis...&quot; she smiled as she recalled Soi&#39;s haymaker 
knockout of Ichimaru, then lifted up a slender hand and placed the 
necklace&#39;s ruby-and-silver pendant between her thumb and forefinger. 
&quot;...Id&#39;s really dice,&quot; Yoruichi admitted as she turned it over a few 
times, the flickering light of the television illuminating the many 
facets of the gem and its metal lining.

&quot;Uh...Thanks,&quot; Soi answered, her tone somewhere between appreciation and 
discomfort. She hoped that at least the older girl wouldn&#39;t ask her what 
everyone else asked her when they saw the thing. But sure enough...

&quot;Where&#39;d dyew ged id?&quot;

&quot;...My mom gave it to me...for my 9th birthday.&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure if she 
had expected Yoruichi to say anything, or to pry further, but when the 
upperclassman spoke a few moments later it was a simple statement, not a 
vague question.

&quot;...You musd miss her a lod.&quot; Soi blinked, surprised at what her friend 
had said. Before she could ask how Yoruichi had found out, she realized 
that the older girl must have simply read between the lines. She wasn&#39;t 
stupid, after all.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Soi answered quietly while Yoruichi relinquished her hold on 
the charm, letting it land softly against the fabric of her friend&#39;s 
blouse. &quot;...She got sick a few years ago, but she didn&#39;t tell me or Dad 
about it. I was angry at her for a while afterwards, but...I know that 
it was just her way of taking care of us. It&#39;s just...sometimes I feel 
like I...I wanna be as strong, like that, but...&quot; Soi blinked once she 
realized what was coming out of her mouth, and she covered it up with a 
free hand to keep herself from contiinuing. &quot;Oh, jeez, I&#39;m sorry-- I&#39;m 
sure you didn&#39;t wanna hear about my problems--&quot;

&quot;...Dit&#39;s all righd,&quot; the half-asleep senior responded as she turned 
herself to the television set again, her long hair laying askew on Soi&#39;s 
abdomen. &quot;Id&#39;s nod a bad thig do tog aboud stub lig this if id&#39;s on your 
mide.&quot; When she heard her younger friend sigh in response, Yoruichi 
spoke again, rubbing her eyes as she did so. &quot;...I thing...dat your Mob 
would be broud ob you, Doi.&quot; Soi Fong said nothing to Yoruichi&#39;s 
statement, but it did make her slightly glad to hear it from someone 
other than her father for once...even if it was barely intelligible. It 
was only after a few minutes of silent comtemplation that the young girl 
suddenly became cognizant of something that she&#39;d forgotten about 
entirely, something she should have noticed hours ago but had ignored in 
her rush to see to Yoruichi&#39;s health.

&quot;Um...Yoruichi-san...Where are YOUR parents? Shouldn&#39;t they be here to 
take care of y--&quot; She stopped once she took another look at her friend 
and saw that Yoruichi was fast asleep, a steady rhythm overtaking her 
breathing pattern.

Oh, crap...I was worried about this.

She tried to slip her legs out from underneath Yoruichi&#39;s head, but was 
surprised and frustrated to find that her position was such that she 
couldn&#39;t move without potentially waking her up. After a moment of 
agitated thought, Soi decided to try and lift Yoruichi up just enough 
that she could move, but the task proved equally impossible.

Damnit...she&#39;s heavy! She&#39;s not that much bigger than me, but geez!

Not sure if the problem lay more in her own weakness or in Yoruichi&#39;s 
relative weight, Soi finally gave up and accepted that she would be 
stuck in this position unitl morning. She took a glance at her sick 
friend&#39;s profile and smiled unconsciously as she turned off the TV, 
letting the room fill with a peaceful silence. It only took a little 
while for Soi to nod off as well.</pre>
