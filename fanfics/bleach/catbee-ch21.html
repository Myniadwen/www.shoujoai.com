Soi yawned as she stepped into the shower, her fatigue so great that not 
even the hot water pouring down on her umprepared skin was enough to 
bring her to cognizance. With memory as the guide her still closed eyes 
could not be, she reached over to the soap ledge and grabbed the small 
opaque bar before rubbing it onto a light-green washcloth. She was in 
the middle of lathering her pale arms when she heard the outer door 
click open. Immediately the girl&#39;s sleepiness vanished and she raised 
her head irritably to see the vague form of someone tall on the other 
side of the frosted glass. Her father knew better than to come in while 
she was showering, so what could he be doing?

&quot;Dad, I told you-- I&#39;ll be out in a min--&quot;

&quot;...Hello.&quot;

In spite of the humidity surrounding her, Soi instantly turned pale. 
That voice, so lyrical and so sensual... It couldn&#39;t be... Before she 
could gather the fortitude to ask who was there, the door slid open to 
reveal a very familiar pair of warm topaz eyes.

&quot;Y-Y-Yoruichi-san!&quot; Soi immediately reached for a towel to cover herself 
with, but contented with using her hands when nothing was found to be 
available. &quot;W-w-w-what are y-you doing here!&quot;

&quot;Hmm?...Oh... My water pressure went out this morning...and I 
just...figured I&#39;d use your shower today.&quot; In spite of her 
embarrassment, Soi narrowed her eyes in confusion. Why would Yoruichi 
have come here for that? Didn&#39;t Kisuke live closer anyway? The slightly 
distracted tone in Yoruichi&#39;s voice, along with the way she was staring 
at her very naked body, didn&#39;t make her feel any more certain about what 
was going on. Suddenly she noticed what Yoruichi was wearing-- or 
rather, what she wasn&#39;t; the only thing between her body and Soi&#39;s very 
wide eyes was a towel that looked like she&#39;d had to make an effort to 
keep on her. &quot;...You don&#39;t mind...right?&quot; Soi felt her brain 
short-circuit when Yoruichi made eye contact with her, the smoldering 
heat of the other girl&#39;s gaze coupled with the rather libidinous smile 
she flashed were almost enough to drive her over the edge.

&quot;N-n-n-n-no,&quot; Soi finally managed to get out, looking away as her face 
began to turn purple.

&quot;...Well? Can I get in?&quot; Yoruichi asked after a moment. It took Soi 
nearly a minute to gather her remaining wits and allow a shocked 
&quot;W-w-w-w-w-what!&quot; to escape her lips.

&quot;I...I-I-I mean, n-no. J-just give me a minute t--to...&quot; Soi began, but 
it drifts off into nothing when Yoruichi&#39;s towel suddenly falls to the 
ground, its knot undone so quickly that the younger girl doesn&#39;t notice.

Oh God.

&quot;...Oops,&quot; the Senior noted with wide eyes and a hand over her mouth in 
a false display of surprise. &quot;So now...there&#39;s no problem, 
right?...Didn&#39;t think so,&quot; she smiled with hungry eyes as she stepped 
in, her skin already flecked with drops of water that would&#39;ve hit where 
the open shower door was. Soi just nods dumbly, trying to ignore the 
flawless body before her but failing so completely that her eyes are 
drawn downward.

&quot;...Do you like what you see, Soi? You naughty girl, you.&quot; Soi 
physically shook herself out of the trance at Yoruichi&#39;s teasing 
comment, then began fumbling for an excuse.

&quot;Uh...I...that is, uh-I-I-um...&quot;

&quot;You know what your problem is?&quot; Yoruichi whispers as she leans even 
closer, taking the opportunity to smell the lingering aroma of soap on 
the freshman even as she makes the blush rise with her predatory gaze. 
&quot;...You talk too much.&quot; Soi is still in the middle of her rebuttal when 
Yoruichi suddenly pounces on her, forcing her against the porcelin wall 
of the shower, then yanks her head back and mashes their lips together.

Soi feels absolutely ecstatic, caught in the grip of a very coherent 
Yoruichi, her only possible handicap being the utter blindness of her 
lust. The freshman gasps into the kiss as Yoruichi&#39;s hand travels down 
the small of her back, which turns into a moan as the older woman takes 
the opportunity and slides her tongue into Soi&#39;s very willing mouth. Soi 
is just growing bold enough to respond in kind when Yoruichi&#39;s mouth 
suddenly withdrawls. Before Soi can protest, she lets out a pleasured 
yelp as she feels Yoruichi nibble along her collarbone.

&quot;Mmm... Much better,&quot; Yoruichi says with a confident smile in between 
kisses. But all of a sudden the cockiness disappears and she&#39;s looking 
at Soi like she can&#39;t see anything else. &quot;...Oh God, I love you, Soi...I 
haven&#39;t stopped thinking about you since the festival...&quot;

&quot;W...What?&quot; Soi manages when Yoruichi lets up just enough to let her 
catch her breath. &quot;...B-but I t-t-thought that you were drunk...&quot; She 
catches a glimpse of a knowing smile that even plays upon Yoruichi&#39;s 
eyes as the older woman goes lower, her lips illiciting louder moans and 
begging from Soi the farther she descends.

&quot;Oh...Lower, Yoruichi...Please...More...&quot;

&quot;...Soi? Everything all right in there?&quot;

The freshman nearly screams upon being brought back to reality so 
harshly, pulling her hand from between her legs once she sees what she&#39;d 
been doing unconsciously.

&quot;D-Dad!&quot; Soi winced at her own tone as she said it; anyone who wasn&#39;t as 
hurried as him would&#39;ve realized she was hiding something.

&quot;...You&#39;ve been in there a while. Come on, you&#39;re going to be late for 
school! Quit lollygagging!&quot;

&quot;O-Okay!&quot; Soi answered distractedly, realizing as she hears her father 
walk away that she&#39;s wasted all her time asleep standing up. She heaved 
a self-annoyed sigh, then turned the water faucet hard to the left to 
make sure that it won&#39;t leak all morning.

The freshman groaned as she took another bite of her hastily prepared 
toast while she walked, though it wasn&#39;t the late-August heat that was 
bothering her right now. She&#39;d been having erotic dreams about Yoruichi 
ever since they&#39;d come back from the beach nearly two weeks ago, but 
that one in the shower was the most graphic fantasy she&#39;d had so far. 
She didn&#39;t mind them at all when they actually happened upon her, in her 
sleep, but for one to just pop out at her like it had was a little 
troubling. She was going to see Yoruichi at school today, the first time 
in nearly a month that they&#39;d talk in person. The idea of one of 
those...things...happening to her while she and Yoruichi were 
together...

Come on, she shook off the troubling insecurity with a shudder. It 
couldn&#39;t be that hard to conceal her feelings from the older girl-- 
hell, she&#39;d been able to keep herself from realizing it for months! But 
then... once she&#39;d understood how she felt, those dreams had started 
happening. It felt so strange...she&#39;d never wanted to touch herself 
before, not with any guy she&#39;d known or any person she&#39;d ever met. But 
with Yoruichi those urges suddenly became powerful, almost 
uncontrollable. Or was it maybe that what she really wanted was for 
Yoruichi to touch her? Soi was contemplating this when she suddenly felt 
people bumping past her, struggling to get into the building before her 
that she suddenly realized was her school. Without bothering to think 
about how her feet had carried her there, the freshman ran inside, 
secretly grateful that she hadn&#39;t seen Yoruichi yet.

Soi was chewing on a piece of her omelette at lunch, glancing around the 
classroom from her desk, torn between feeling glad that she hadn&#39;t 
suffered the awkwardness of having to see Yoruichi again but at the same 
time wishing she was there. It wasn&#39;t as though she was going out of her 
way to avoid the Senior, but it bothered Soi that she hadn&#39;t even 
noticed her today. Was she sick again? Could she, possibly, have 
remembered the kiss and was avoiding her on purpose? Suddenly she felt a 
hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, but not jump, though she 
couldn&#39;t say the same for her heart when she turned around to see that 
face.

HER face, smiling down at her.

&quot;Hey, Soi!&quot;

&quot;H-h-hey,&quot; the freshman answered as calmly as she could, which wasn&#39;t 
much considering that her hands were shaking. Yoruichi either didn&#39;t 
notice Soi&#39;s reaction or didn&#39;t comment on it, because she sat right 
down and plopped her lunchbag on a nearby desk.

&quot;...Mind if I eat?&quot; Soi tried to answer, but Yoruichi&#39;s perpetually 
bright smile seemed to inhibit her thoughts, rendering her incapable of 
anything other than nodding. As Yoruichi hungrily began to remove the 
contents of her bag, Soi couldn&#39;t help but notice the way her 
longsleeved uniform shirt hugged her arms, betraying the slender, 
elegant limbs hidden beneath. &quot;So, what&#39;d you do with the rest of your 
summer break?&quot; The sudden question made Soi blink out of her reverie, 
but she was able to provide a satisfactory answer without too much 
mental fumbling.

&quot;Oh, uh...Not much. Just...just hanging out...&quot; Soi trailed off as she 
followed the movements of Yoruichi&#39;s hands with her eyes, watching them 
beautifully go about the otherwise simple task of popping a straw into a 
container of juice.

&quot;Ah...Well, you should&#39;ve called me! We could&#39;ve done something 
together!&quot;

&quot;Y...Yeah...&quot; Soi muttered as she felt herself begin to drift, began to 
imagine Yoruichi leaning across the desk and kissing her...

&quot;Hey, you all right? You seem kinda out of it,&quot; Yoruichi observed as she 
took a drink, sucking on the straw just enough to coax the liquid within 
out.

&quot;N-no, I&#39;m fine,&quot; the younger girl said casually as she stood up, 
forgetting about her half-finished lunch as she did so. &quot;I&#39;m just...just 
gonna go get something...&quot; Yoruichi made to stand up and accompany Soi, 
but the freshman gave a slight wave and began to walk out of the 
classroom, then broke into a run once the older girl was out of sight. 
Soi careened into the nearest girl&#39;s bathroom, then dashed straight up 
to the first sink she came across and splashed herself with water once 
her cupped hands were full.

She gave a sigh as she stared at her dripping-wet reflection in the 
mirror, hoping that the water would be able to wash away the lustful 
thoughts she was having regarding her sempai. All that she had done, 
however, was get herself and the top part of her uniform wet. She had 
hoped that she&#39;d be able to control her longing for Yoruichi the way she 
had before, but she&#39;d been wrong. It was nothing like before; every last 
one of Yoruichi&#39;s movements kept Soi hypnotized and hungry for her, like 
she was under a powerful spell for which there was no cure. But Soi 
wasn&#39;t one to simply lay down and die, to display emotional weakness. 
She could be strong if she wanted to, and to keep from giving herself 
away she&#39;d need every last ounce of her willpower.

...This is gonna be harder than I thought, Soi groaned as she pulled a 
sheet of paper towels from the nearby dispenser and ran it across her 
damp face.

&quot;Geez, I can&#39;t believe all this crap,&quot; Yoruichi groaned as she rifled 
through her binder. &quot;...I thought Senior year was supposed to be easy, 
but they just keep pilin&#39; on the homework.&quot; Urahara only chuckled 
knowingly as he adjusted his backpack, but he bristled slightly as Soi 
bumped into him for the fifth time.

&quot;Hey, lay off the booze, kiddo-- You can&#39;t even walk a straight line 
anymore.&quot; Soi flinched out of her daze at Kisuke&#39;s teasing, then tore 
her eyes away from Yoruichi, silently cursing herself for looking too 
long.

&quot;S-sorry.&quot;

&quot;Hey, are you SURE you&#39;re all right? You&#39;re acting kinda weird today,&quot; 
the older girl said as she craned her head up to see past Kisuke&#39;s hat. 
&quot;Have you been getting enough sleep?&quot;

&quot;...Y-Yeah. Yeah, I...I&#39;m just kinda tired,&quot; Soi fibbed as she forced 
herself to look at the sidewalk. She let out a sigh as she reminded 
herself that she only had about 5 minutes until they parted ways, 
feeling both relieved and disappointed by the prospect. She was just 
wondering how she would be able to get through another year of this 
awkwardness when Yoruichi suddenly smacked herself on the head and 
turned around.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Kisuke asked as he watched his friend walk back the 
way they came.

&quot;Oh, I forgot my book for AIZEN&#39;s class,&quot; Yoruichi answered with a roll 
of the eyes. &quot;...If I don&#39;t get that shit done for tomorrow he&#39;s gonna 
be on my ass all day.&quot;

&quot;Well, here, I can go back with you...&quot; Soi felt herself tense at 
Kisuke&#39;s offer to the object of her affection , but fortunately Yoruichi 
declined his company with a wave of the hand.

&quot;No thanks. You guys go ahead, okay?&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; the blonde said as he nodded. He turned and continued 
walking with Soi until he noticed an odd expression on Soi&#39;s face.

&quot;...What?&quot; The freshman asked brightly, her disappointment at Yoruichi&#39;s 
early departure disappearing in an instant.

&quot;Nothin,&#39;&quot; Kisuke remarked with a shrug, then waved goodbye a few 
minutes later when he came to his street.

Yoruichi wandered through the dark halls of the school, surprised that 
the building had been cleaned so early in the day. But then, Fall sports 
tryouts were all week, so of course people would make an effort at 
keeping the rooms neat to avoid the shame of being the last one on the 
field. After a few minutes spent straining her eyes in the dark she 
finally came across her locker, and moments later she had the heavy 
textbook in her hand. Just as she was shoving the Mathematics book into 
her bookcase, a loud bang sounded out a little ways down the hall.

...That&#39;s weird, Yoruichi thought with a raised eyebrow. I thought 
everyone was gone?

The recently nurtured side of Yoruichi that advocated responsibility and 
virtue felt inclined to just turn and ignore it, but the much older and 
more indulged persona that lived for trouble wanted to get a closer 
look. It didn&#39;t take the Senior long to decide which one she wanted to 
listen to. Setting her bookcase quietly down as she carefully shut her 
locker, Yoruichi walked over to the source of the noise, being careful 
not to make noise as she did so.

...Aizen&#39;s class?

She was just wondering what that creep could&#39;ve been up to after hours 
at school when she heard his voice on the other side of the door.

&quot;...about that. I guess I should...more careful...&quot;

&quot;Sosuke! I...think you&#39;re taking...seriously...&quot;

Yoruichi blinked at the sudden appearance of the second voice. It 
sounded like a girl&#39;s-- maybe even one from her own grade. She decided 
not to bother with asking herself questions at this point and leaned 
closer to the sliding plastic door, the better to hear the conversation.

&quot;...Listen, we can&#39;t keep doing this HERE anymore. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s 
safe.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. You&#39;re cute when you worry like that.&quot;

The upperclassman nearly did a double-take. Did she just hear Aizen 
being...affectionate? This couldn&#39;t possibly be the same man who 
harrassed Kuukaku and her on a daily basis. She had a sudden urge to 
have her curiousity sated further, but held it down by listening harder.

&quot;Sosuke...&quot; the girl said with a bit of a laugh in her voice, as though 
his joviality had infected her in some way. &quot;...I really should be 
getting home. My parents are gonna chew me out if I&#39;m later than I was 
last time...&quot;

That was all Yoruichi needed to hear to confirm her suspicions. At first 
she&#39;d thought that Aizen must be doing something with an aide or even a 
teacher, but this was definitely a student!

&quot;...Your parents...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious! They&#39;ve noticed how late I&#39;ve been coming home-- they&#39;re 
already asking me if I have a boyfriend!&quot;

The dark-skinned girl blinked as she suddenly found her hand on the door 
handle.

Just a peek... she assured herself as she slowly slid the door just 
enough to see inside.

&quot;Listen, don&#39;t worry. I promise that I&#39;ll try to be more careful from 
now on,&quot; Aizen said to his lover. &quot;...I really do care about you, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;...I know...&quot; the girl responded in a whisper as Yoruichi leaned over 
and nearly cried out in shock at what she saw.

Momo Hinamori, the class representative, was sitting on Aizen&#39;s lap on 
the floor, a coat over her shoulders providing the only shield against 
her obvious nudity. Her hair was out of its normal bun and she had one 
of her tiny arms around the teacher&#39;s neck and one was on his bare 
chest, the better to provide balance as she kissed him deeply on the 
lips. Aizen&#39;s normally slicked-back hair was down and his glasses were 
askew on the floor beside them, and he had a single arm wrapped entirely 
around the girl&#39;s shoulders as he returned the gesture in earnest.

That was all Yoruichi saw before she backed away. It took her a moment 
walking dumbly back down the hall to remember her bookcase, which she 
hastily grabbed and then left the school as quickly as she could.
