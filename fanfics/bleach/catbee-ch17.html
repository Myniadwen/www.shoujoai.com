&quot;Now, then,&quot; Sosuke Aizen adressed his homeroom just before the last 
bell, &quot;...By now most of you have completed the majority of your 
mid-term tests, correct?&quot; There was a general nod of assent among the 
students of Class 4-E, after which the bespectacled teacher continued. 
&quot;I&#39;m sure that many of you are of the impression that the teacher likes 
to &#39;go easy&#39; on students for the last class of the term. I, however, am 
NOT one of them...And Miss Shiba, refrain from showing such disrespect 
or you willl be punished harshly.&quot;

Kuukaku made no response as she ceased her not-too-subtle mockery of 
Aizen, having heard this tirade before twice; she simply slumped back 
into her chair. She doubted Aizen could do anything terribly threatening 
to her, but the girl decided not to test her luck today. After a few 
moments spent giving Kuukaku a stony gaze, Aizen continued.

&quot;...I&#39;m not, however, without mercy. If there&#39;s anything you don&#39;t 
understand about the material, feel free to ask me and I&#39;ll go over it 
with you in detail.&quot; Half-a-minute later the tone sounded, announcing 
the end of the school day, and the class slowly began to file out once 
they&#39;d bowed to their instructor. Yoruichi and Kuukaku walked straight 
to the door, passing a group of slower students who were lining up to 
get help from Aizen. Suddenly Kuukaku groaned as a smaller girl bumped 
into her, coming in from outside the hall.

&quot;OW! Hey, watch i--&quot; She did a double-take when she saw who it was, a 
petite girl with a scared-mouse face and her hair tied up in a bun. 
&quot;Oh... Sorry, Hinamori-chan.&quot;

&quot;I-It&#39;s alright,&quot; the class representative for their homeroom said 
quietly as she accepted a hand up from Yoruichi, bending down to grab 
her fallen notebook once she had her feet firmly planted on the floor 
again. &quot;...It&#39;s my fault anyway for going against the crowd.&quot;

&quot;Did you forget something?&quot; Yoruichi asked curiously.

&quot;N-no,&quot; Momo answered as she glanced down at the tile floor. &quot;...I just, 
um...I needed to talk to Sosuk-- I mean, Aizen-sensei,&quot; she corrected 
before the other two girls had time to let the confused looks they were 
preparing appear on their faces. As if he could hear her thoughts, the 
teacher in question called out to the tiny girl.

&quot;Miss Hinamori!&quot;

&quot;I-I&#39;m coming, Aizen-sensei!&quot; Momo stuttered as she bumped past Kuukaku 
again, as though at the sound of Aizen&#39;s voice she could neither see or 
hear anything else.

&quot;...Man, talk about your crushes,&quot; the taller of the two upperclassman 
muttered dismissively as they walked away from the dreaded classroom. 
&quot;...So, are you gonna ask her?&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Yoruichi blinked, as the weeklong academic gauntlet had been 
occupying her thoughts of late.

&quot;You know,&quot; Kuukaku chided with a roll of the eyes, &quot;...That Soi Fong 
kid, about your summer plans this year! And don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t get 
the place &#39;cause I wanna--&quot;

&quot;No, no, I rented it for a week, just like we decided,&quot; the Shihouin 
girl said with a steadying wave. &quot;...It&#39;s just that...well...she&#39;s not 
really the &#39;partying&#39; type, and I don&#39;t wanna make her uncomfortable.&quot; 
At the sound of a mocking chuckle from her companion, Yoruichi&#39;s brow 
narrowed slightly. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Whatever-- that&#39;s all the more reason TO bring her, I say. That girl&#39;s 
too tight-strung...It&#39;d do her some good to unwind.&quot; Yoruichi had to 
admit that her friend was right, even if the idea of Soi being the only 
freshman in a group of most-likely-drunk seniors didn&#39;t sit well with 
her. Hopefully, she could just forget to ask her, and then there 
wouldn&#39;t be any problem... &quot;Oh hey, speak of the devil,&quot; Kuukaku said 
while pointing further up the hall. Yoruichi blanched slightly as she 
followed her friend&#39;s gaze to see Soi Fong walking towards them, 
oblivious to their presence thanks to the textbook she was trying to 
look over at the last minute. &quot;Hey, kid!&quot;

Soi recognized Kuukaku&#39;s obnoxious voice and noticed her slightly out of 
the corner of her eye, but was preparing to ignore the Shiba when she 
noticed who was accompanying her and the young girl&#39;s heart did a 
backflip. It was getting harder and harder to ignore this thing that 
would happen in Yoruichi&#39;s presence ever since the Karate test.

&quot;H-Hi, Yoruichi-san!&quot; Soi greeted the dark girl, completely oblivious to 
the other girl. Kuukaku was about to &#39;discipline&#39; the freshman for being 
so rude, but decided instead to roll her eyes and ignore what had 
happened.

&quot;Hey, Soi.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s up, kid?&quot; Soi&#39;s smile evaporated the second she was forced to 
acknowledge Kuukaku, which she did with a slight, half-hearted bow. An 
awkward silence passed for a minute before Yoruichi decided to break the 
ice.

&quot;Uh, how was your Lit final?&quot;

&quot;Oh! It...it went pretty well,&quot; Soi said, even as she was trying to talk 
herself into banishing the smile that had reappeared on her face, as she 
feared it made her look like an idiot.

&quot;Hey, look,&quot; Yoruichi began as people continued to file past them, 
heading out the front door. &quot;...Soi, what are you doing next week?&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Not too much, I don&#39;t think,&quot; the Chinese girl said quickly, only 
skimming the short mental list of activities she had planned. Suddenly, 
the significance of Yoruichi&#39;s query hit her, and a thought occurred to 
the girl that threatened to turn her already red face to an unhealthy 
purple.

Is...does she want to do something with...with ME?

&quot;W...Why?&quot; she managed to finish before she popped a blood vessel.

&quot;Well, y&#39;see, since this is our last summer break before college...and 
by &#39;our&#39; I mean Kisuke, Kuukaku and I... We decided to rent a beach 
house out of town this year. And, well, since we&#39;re trying to get a 
bunch of people to come with us, I thought I&#39;d ask if you wanted to 
come.&quot; Soi blinked while the weight of Yoruichi&#39;s request hit her, 
unable to believe that this wasn&#39;t some sort of joke.

&quot;A...A beach house? But...but those are so expensive!&quot; Soi exclaimed, 
forgetting briefly that with Yoruichi&#39;s money, she could easily afford 
to buy an entire beach for herself.

&quot;Hey...it&#39;s no trouble,&quot; Yoruichi said even as she gave Kuukaku a 
significant glare that the other girl chose to ignore blithely.

&quot;W-well, maybe...I&#39;d have to ask my Dad, okay?&quot; Soi said as evenly as 
she could. &quot;...How long would it be?&quot;

&quot;Not long,&quot; Yoruichi answered as she shifted her books from her right 
arm to her left one. &quot;Just a week.&quot;

A whole week...

&quot;O-okay!&quot; Soi said as she hobbled away, nearly forgetting in her 
flustered state which direction her locker was in.

&quot;Be sure to tell me by tomorrow if you&#39;re coming, okay?&quot; Yoruichi smiled 
as Soi headed off. She didn&#39;t have anything to worry about as far as the 
freshman was concerned, though. The idea of a week with Yoruichi, even 
shared with a few other people, was enough to make her certain that she 
NEEDED to go on this trip.

&quot;Okay, do you have your sleeping bag?&quot; Soi brought herself to a halt 
just short of the door at the sound of her father&#39;s voice.

&quot;Yes, Dad,&quot; the girl answered impatiently as she adjusted the duffel bag 
on her shoulder, sliding open the zipper to go through her belongings. 
She was surprised at how easily her father had granted permission when 
Soi had first mentioned the beach house, but after a week of preparation 
the realization of what he had permitted hit him, and he seemed intent 
on worrying about his daughter all the way up to her departure.

&quot;Now you&#39;re sure you have enough clothes, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Dad...&quot;

&quot;Okay, now be sure to say &#39;thank you&#39; to your friends for inviting you, 
and--&quot;

&quot;Dad!&quot; Soi finally exclaimed in frustration, but her eyes widened when 
she became aware of her additude and gave her father an apologetic bow. 
&quot;...I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s all right,&quot; the older man said with a shrug. &quot;...I just want 
you to be safe, okay? But...be sure to have fun, too. These years won&#39;t 
come around again, you know,&quot; he amended with a teasing smile. A few 
moments later there was a knock at the door, to which he called, &quot;The 
door&#39;s open!&quot; and Yoruichi poked her head out from the other side, not 
wanting to take her shoes off and come in.

&quot;Hey, Soi! What&#39;s the hold-up? We gotta get on the road!&quot;

&quot;O-okay!&quot; Soi answered with an excited smile, turning to give her father 
a quick goodbye before running to follow her friend out the door. &quot;Bye, 
Dad!&quot; He followed Soi to the door and waved her off, wondering as the 
group drove off in Kisuke&#39;s car if he&#39;d imagined the blush on his 
daughter&#39;s face.

&quot;WOO-HOO!&quot; Kuukaku yelled once Urahara had maneuvered his two-door sedan 
onto the highway, startling the vehicle&#39;s other occupants. &quot;This is 
gonna kick ass!&quot;

&quot;Oh, hey--thanks for taking my seat, Kuukaku,&quot; Yoruichi groaned from the 
cramped backseat where she and Soi were crammed like sardines.

&quot;Well, hey-- finders keepers,&quot; the rowdy young woman with a grin.

&quot;Jeez, Shiba,&quot; Kisuke responded with a groan from the driver&#39;s seat, 
&quot;...Keep this up and I&#39;ll have you switched with someone from Rangiku&#39;s 
ca--&quot;

He stopped short on the urging of a sudden, dangerous look from his 
dark-skinned friend in the backseat, but Soi Fong had already come to an 
understanding.

&quot;...Matsumoto-san&#39;s coming?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Yoruichi began, worrying when she saw the color fade slightly 
from Soi&#39;s face. &quot;...Yeah. See, SOMEHOW the word got out (at this she 
glared daggers at Kuukaku), and then a bunch of seniors wanted to come, 
so we just...decided to make a party out of it...&quot; she drifted off 
uneasily, wondering if Soi would want to leave after learning about 
this.

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s okay!&quot; Yoruichi and Kisuke blinked in unison at the young 
girl&#39;s suspiciously enthusiastic response, the latter of whom nearly 
missed the exit for the next highway in his shock.

&quot;...Are you sure?&quot; The blonde upperclassman asked, eyeing Soi through 
his rearview mirror and noting that she seemed unable to meet his gaze.

&quot;Y-Yeah. I mean, you guys were nice enough to invite me-- I don&#39;t have 
any right to complain about who you invite. Besides, I like 
Matsumoto-san.&quot; Yoruichi looked at the younger girl uneasily before 
turning to look out the window, and after a few minutes of awkward 
silence Kuukaku complained about the lack of music and promptly turned 
up the radio. Soi hadn&#39;t been lying when she said she didn&#39;t mind 
Rangiku&#39;s attendance-- it was her boyfriend that she was worried about.

4 hours, two pit-stops and a hurried meal curteousy of a greasy 
little-off road burger pit later, the quartet heaved a sigh of relief as 
they stretched their legs upon reaching their destination.

&quot;...So, what do you guys think?&quot; Yoruichi said with a self-satisfied 
grin as she indicated the house she&#39;d managed to acquire-- a spacious, 
yet cozy looking two-story house, sitting less than a stone&#39;s throw from 
the sea. Kuukaku gave an appraising nod (ignoring a struggling Urahara&#39;s 
wordless pleas for help with the mountain of luggage he was swamped 
under), while Soi stared, wide-eyed, until she managed to utter an 
impressed grunt. &quot;Hmph,&quot; Yoruichi grinned at the youngest&#39;s face as she 
gave her hair a light tousle. &quot;You&#39;re so easy to please, Soi-- much 
better than SOMEONE around here.&quot;

&quot;...What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Kuukaku sneered as she took the hint 
from Kisuke and grabbed the red cooler sitting in the back, groaning 
slightly under its weight.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Yoruichi said as she withdrew her hand and Soi felt a slight 
tinge of disappointment, which she was able to hide when the older woman 
looked in her direction. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get unpacked.&quot;

&quot;Anyone here?&quot; Rangiku called out as she pushed the unlocked front door 
to the beach-house ajar, her emerald eyes widening at the grandeur of 
the building.

Wow, the blonde mouthed wordlessly as she picked up the spare bag she&#39;d 
put down to open the door. Way to go, Yoruichi...

&quot;Hey, Rangiku!&quot; Yoruichi said jovially as she came to greet her friend. 
&quot;Did you find the place okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, no problem-- everyone else is getting stuff now...&quot; Rangiku began 
just as a tall, almost tomboyish looking girl with short white hair and 
a braid pushed past her. &quot;Hey! Watch it!&quot; The girl didn&#39;t respond at 
first; she set her heavy bags onto the floor and out of the way before 
she tried to speak through heavy breathing.

&quot;S...Sorry...Rangiku...b...but...I...didn&#39;t really...have time 
to...apologize...&quot; Before Yoruichi had a chance to say hello, a handful 
of other people came in-- a pair of young men, one with platinum blonde 
hair and the other sporting stubble to challenge even Kisuke and a 
ponytail to boot; this man was accompanied closely by a rather severe 
looking woman with glasses and a tight bun for a hairstyle. Yoruichi 
smiled as she looked at the boys, a warm sense of nostalgia that made 
her grab the blonde and give him a rough but playful headlock.

&quot;OW! Not so hard, Yoruichi...&quot; Ukitake said even as he began to laugh. 
He&#39;d forgotten how strong the girl could be when she wanted to 
rough-house.

&quot;You guys made it! Oh man, it&#39;s been way too long!&quot; the dark-skinned 
girl laughed as she smacked the scraggly-looking teen in the back, 
making him double-over when coupled to the weight of his suitcase. &quot;Hey, 
Kisuke! Get away from the damn stove and get out here!&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot; her confidant called as he walked in, wearing a plain white 
apron that he&#39;d doubled up and had tied around his waist. It took him a 
moment to register who was there when he saw them, then he, like 
Yoruichi, ran up and slapped both on the shoulder.

&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t you two! What&#39;s it been-- three years?&quot;

&quot;Somethin&#39; like that,&quot; Ukitake said warmly. &quot;Oh, and by the way, Renji 
called; he and Rukia are driving here on their own and&#39;ll be here 
tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. I can only imagine what THEY&#39;LL be doing,&quot; Rangiku said with a 
suggestive grin, to which the quartet laughed loudly.

&quot;Oh! Rangiku-chan!&quot; the ponytailed boy said with a lecherous grin, as 
he&#39;d just noted her presence. &quot;...I haven&#39;t seen you for awhile! How 
&#39;bout a h--&quot; He was cut off in mid-sentence not by the blonde&#39;s fist, 
but by an elbow to the gut from the stoic young woman beside him.

&quot;Watch it, Shunsui,&quot; she said simply, but it was enough to make her male 
counterpart straighten up immediately.

&quot;Hey, who&#39;s this?&quot; Kisuke asked when he noticed the girl.

&quot;Oh! I&#39;m glad you asked!&quot; Shunsui grinned as he put an arm around her. 
&quot;She&#39;s my girlf--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Nanao Ise,&quot; she finished after slapping Kyoraku&#39;s hand away, then 
extending it in a gesture of greeting.

&quot;Hey, Yoruichi-san!&quot; Soi called as she came down the stairs. &quot;...Have 
you seen my-- Oh...Hello, everyone,&quot; the freshman amended upon seeing 
the crowd gathered there, feeling her enthusiasm for the week evaporate 
as she did so. She hadn&#39;t thought there&#39;d be THIS many people here, all 
of whom were at least two years older than her.

&quot;Oh, good-- You can meet everyone!&quot; the older girl said with a smile, 
not noticing that most of the people behind her had gotten a little 
downcast at having their reunion marred by the presence of an 
underclassman. As one, however, they all seemed to hide their 
disappointment when Yoruichi turned back around. &quot;Everyone, I&#39;d like you 
to meet Soi Fong. Soi, this is Isane (the short-haired girl smiled a 
greeting), Shunsui (he nodded politely at the Chinese girl), Ukitake (he 
waved a kindly &#39;hello&#39; in her direction), and, uh...Shinsui&#39;s 
girlfriend...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s &#39;Nanao,&#39;&quot; the bespectacled girl corrected smoothly.

&quot;Right,&quot; Yoruichi admitted with a roll of the eyes. Soi gave the group 
as a whole a low bow, muttering through a blush that she hoped she 
wouldn&#39;t be a bother. Instead of dejected muttering, however, she was 
surprised at the collective &#39;Aww&#39; that issued from the upperclassmen.

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi managed to get out before Ukitake came up and patted her 
on the head.

&quot;Where&#39;d you find this girl, Yoruichi? She&#39;s so cute!&quot;

...Cute? Soi wondered, uncertain if she should be flattered or offended 
for being thusly patronized. She looked desperately at Yoruichi as the 
seniors crowded her, asking about herself, but the older girl only gave 
Soi a teasing grin.

&quot;Well, then,&quot; Kisuke called to get his friend&#39;s attention, &quot;...There&#39;s 
lunch in the kitchen, an--&quot; He stopped upon noticing an all-too-familiar 
face come in from outside, a silver-haired grinning boy carrying a large 
suitcase behind him. &quot;Oh, uh...Hey, Gin.&quot;

&quot;...Well, now...&quot; Ichimaru said teasingly as he set the luggage down in 
front of him, &quot;...No need ta stop talkin&#39; on my account...&quot; That was 
exactly what they did, however-- Soi and Yoruichi, along with Kisuke, 
stared at the freshman&#39;s nemesis uneasily, while everyone else who was 
unaware of their &#39;history&#39; only stood still, as the negative energy 
passing between the four was beyond palpable.

&quot;Um...Did I miss something?&quot;

The whole room jumped at the sound of Kuukaku&#39;s voice, who appeared out 
of the kitchen with a half-eaten fried-noodle sub in her right hand.

&quot;N...No,&quot; Rangiku said with an uncomfortable smile. &quot;...We were just 
going to go eat.&quot;

&quot;Oh...Uh, yeah. Come on, guys,&quot; Urahara said as he motioned the group 
into the next room. Before Gin could follow, his girlfriend grabbed him 
by the scruff of the neck and pulled his ear to her mouth.

&quot;Not so fast, you,&quot; she whispered dangerously. Gin&#39;s smile faded when 
Rangiku released him, and at the urging of one of the woman&#39;s angry nods 
he turned to Soi Fong.

&quot;...What do you want?&quot; Soi asked through narrowed eyes while Yoruichi 
leveled Ichimaru with an equally cold glare. Gin gave Rangiku an 
exasperated look, as if he was a child being forced to eat a 
much-dejected meal, but she slapped him on the arm and he proceeded.

To the utter surprise of the other two girls, Gin gave Soi a small bow.

&quot;...Wanted ta&#39; apologize.&quot; He said simply, and the buxom girl behind him 
gave a satisfied nod. &quot;...Rangi--(slap)...I...shouldn&#39;ta been pickin&#39; on 
ya...&quot; he muttered as he rubbed the bright red mark on his face where 
his girlfriend had given him a disciplinary hit. No one said anything 
for a moment, during which Yoruichi pulled Soi close and gave her some 
whispered advice.

&quot;...You&#39;re not gonna believe this bastard, are you?&quot; To her surprise, 
Soi ignored her and gave a slight huff.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said with an air of assumed confidence to the silver-haired 
upperclassman, &quot;...I guess it&#39;s fine. But...&quot; she said with a sudden 
severity, &quot;...I&#39;ll let you off the hook if you just leave me alone.&quot; Gin 
stared at her interestedly, surprised that his prey hadn&#39;t used his 
awkward position to bargain for something more humiliating. And he 
wouldn&#39;t admit it, but that punch of hers had definitely been one of the 
worse ones he&#39;d suffered in years...

&quot;...Deal,&quot; he said simply as he turned away from the two girls and 
headed for the kitchen, followed shortly thereafter by his girlfriend.</pre>
