&quot;Hey, you guys made it!&quot; Yoruichi exclaimed as Shunsui walked in with 
Nanao permitting him to lead her by the arm, and Ukitake bringing up the 
rear. &quot;...I thought you weren&#39;t going to come this year!&quot;

&quot;Ha! As if I&#39;d miss out on a free party at your place!&quot; the scruffy teen 
answered jovially. &quot;Now Yoruichi-san, I&#39;ve got some beer in the backseat 
of my car, but if you&#39;ve already got something stron--&quot;

&quot;...We won&#39;t be drinking tonight,&quot; Nanao cut him off severely, 
accompanied by a smack to her companion&#39;s face. Yoruichi gave the two of 
them a teasing look, then pointed in the direction of the kitchen when 
the bespectacled girl held up a pair of brightly-wrapped packages. 
Ukitake gave her a friendly &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; 
before following his friend&#39;s lead, then breaking off to speak to 
Urahara, busy loitering near the door with a cupfull of soda in hand.

The party was fairly small, as it consisted mainly of her and Kisuke&#39;s 
close friends from the beach house, but it was nonetheless quite the 
festive occasion. The couch and chairs had been pushed slightly to the 
side to make room for people to dance (though few were content to do 
more than hum along idly with the Christmas-themed music), and with 
Kisuke&#39;s help over the past few days she&#39;d succeeded in putting up 
absurdly tall Christmas tree she&#39;d insisted on buying, covering it 
liberally with garlands and flashing lights they had purchased on a 
previous holiday. Rangiku was making one-sided &#39;girl talk&#39; with Nanao 
while Gin lazily observed the room over the top of his cup (Yoruichi had 
invited him mainly as a show of good faith after her attack on him, and 
though she didn&#39;t exactly apologize he didn&#39;t seem terribly intent on 
holding it against her). Kyoraku had invited Isane to moderate an 
argument he was having with Kuukaku (something about whether or not &quot;The 
Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; counted more as a Halloween or Christmas 
movie), and Ukitake was doing his best not to sneeze on the table spread 
with sushi, cake slices and curry chicken; he had a handful of tissues 
in his hand at the ready accompanied by a small bottle of cold medicine.

Once Yoruichi had taken another bite of her cheesecake she reluctantly 
set the decadent treat down and, unable to resist the temptation, she 
opened her front door just enough to see the unpopulated street before 
the house, wincing as the rapidly cooling air nearly gave her 
hypothermia on the spot.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Yoruichi realized at the sound of her best 
friend&#39;s voice that she had been looking outside for nearly two minutes, 
and as such promptly shut the elements out and turned to face the 
blonde.

&quot;What? I&#39;m just looking outside, is all,&quot; the girl answered 
dismissively. &quot;...I heard it was supposed to snow tonight, and--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you do that at least four other times since the party 
started, Yoruichi.&quot; The dark woman sighed in defeat at being found out, 
though the what-kind-of-a-fool-do-you-take-me-for grin on Kisuke&#39;s mug 
was a bit of a wear on her good humor. &quot;What are you looking for? You 
haven&#39;t really talked to anyone since they got here.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m just checking for Soi, okay?&quot; she finally admitted, looking 
none-too-happy about it. &quot;She said she was gonna try to drop by once she 
was done having dinner with her Dad, and I wanna make sure she gets her 
present.&quot;

&quot;...Okay...&quot; Urahara muttered with a shrug as he walked back to the 
party. &quot;...But you know, she&#39;s with her FAMILY on Christmas. I&#39;m not 
saying I know any better than you, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be here for 
a while.&quot; Yoruichi said nothing in response to this; she simply gave the 
closed door a sidelong glance before the boy interrupted her musings 
again. &quot;Come enjoy the party, Yoruichi. It IS yours, after all.&quot;

----------

Soi gave her father an appreciative smile as she carefully pushed aside 
the tissue paper lining the flimsy cardboard box to reveal her gift.

&quot;Well, how is it?&quot; her father asked from a few feet away, busy 
unwrapping the CD she had bought him of his favorite music even as he 
looked to her for a sign of her reaction.

&quot;I...I love it!&quot; she said after a moment of awed silence, holding out 
the black-and-yellow longsleeve at shoulder height. &quot;Thanks, Dad!&quot;

&quot;Now, you know that if you don&#39;t like the color or something that you 
can get it exchanged...&quot;

&quot;No, really-- it&#39;s perfect!&quot; Soi pressed enthusiastically. She wasn&#39;t 
sure why, but somehow it felt like black-and-yellow stripes...suited 
her. &quot;...I&#39;m just glad you got the evening off, is all.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re in the middle of a big case; I&#39;m lucky I got more than an 
extended lunchbreak.&quot; The freshman&#39;s smile widened at the joke as she 
set about picking up the few scraps of wrapping paper and tossing them 
into the nearby wastebasket, looking away as her eyes fell onto her 
watch and told her it was 15 minutes past 6:00.

Yoruichi&#39;s party should be starting now...

While part of her wanted to go, if only for Yoruichi&#39;s sake, the other 
half was adamantly opposed to the situation on account of buyer&#39;s 
remorse. The scarf she&#39;d bought for her sempai had looked so nice 
before, but now it only seemed gaudy and ridiculous.

She&#39;s not gonna miss one gift at the party, Soi reasoned. Not to mention 
that as an underclassman, she&#39;d probably only succeed at ruining the 
vibe of the whole event. It was probably better if she didn&#39;t go and 
then could give her the embarrassing gift later on if she HAD to.

&quot;Well then,&quot; the older man called as he headed to the tiny kitchen, 
&quot;...How about we have some dinner? I bought your favorite kind of 
croquettes the other day...&quot; Within moments Soi threw on an excited 
smile, deciding that she could brood over it when she wasn&#39;t spending 
time with her father.

----------

&quot;Hey, thanks Yoruichi!&quot; Rangiku called from the other side of the living 
room, surrounded by her small mountain of unwrapped gifts, the newest 
addition to which was a rather plain but nonetheless expensive chain 
necklace dangling from the Senior&#39;s left hand. &quot;I really like it!&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah, I really like what you got me...too...&quot; Yoruichi managed as she 
forced a smile on her face and set the gift the blonde and Gin had 
purchased for her with the others she&#39;d also recieved.

Three bottles of sake...do they think that I&#39;m a drunk or something, the 
young woman thought with a wry grin. It wasn&#39;t a bad haul this year, 
though-- a gift certificate for her favorite store in the mall (she 
wondered how Ukitake had found out), an orange windbreaker from Kisuke, 
the trio of bottled rice wine from Rangiku, Shunsui and Kuukaku. While 
everyone was busy talking amongst themselves, unwrapping gifts and 
occasionally trading ones they found unsatisfactory, Yoruichi glanced 
out the window, feeling her spirits drop slightly at the sight of 
rapidly falling snow half-visible thanks to the glare of the indoor 
lights against the glass and already piling up beside the windowsill.

She was starting to worry about Soi, wondering if she was going to get 
to the party or not. Part of her felt like calling, just to make sure 
that if she wasn&#39;t coming that she was enjoying herself, but she brushed 
the thought away. She simply didn&#39;t call people if they were late, it 
was their perogative and thus none of her business, but...

The sound of the front door opening made her jump slightly, and she 
looked away from the window only to find Isane slipping her coat on.

&quot;Well, thanks for inviting me, Yoruichi, but I&#39;ve gotta meet someone for 
breakfast tomorrow, so...&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute! Breakfast during the holiday?&quot; Rangiku called out to the 
short-haired girl, dashing away from her boyfriend and drawing so close 
to Isane that she flinched. &quot;...What&#39;s all THAT about, I wonder?&quot;

&quot;N-nothing,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I-I-I&#39;m just meeting a friend!&quot;

&quot;Ooh, not from THAT tone, you&#39;re not,&quot; the well-endowed girl teased as 
she threw on her most predatory grin. &quot;...Is it a special friend? 
Someone from school?&quot;

&quot;N-n-no,&quot; Isane insisted. &quot;She&#39;s just--!&quot; In an instant the girl covered 
her mouth, face burning red from embaressment.

&quot;Oh, so it&#39;s a SHE, eh?&quot; Shunsui called from his sprawled position on 
the floor, suddenly finding an interest in the conversation. &quot;Well that 
definitely proves it! I wonder who it is?&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Kuukaku said with a smirk. &quot;It&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;Kuukaku!&quot;

&quot;Relax, Isane--I&#39;m just kidding,&quot; the gruff woman said with a dismissive 
wave while everyone shared a chuckle at Isane&#39;s expense.

&quot;...Ah, forget it!&quot; Isane grumbled as she headed out, slamming the door 
behind her.

&quot;Geez, I think we were a little hard on the kid,&quot; Kisuke admitted as he 
went back to fiddling with the wooden cane Yoruichi had bought him as a 
gag present.

&quot;Ahh, don&#39;t worry-- I wouldn&#39;t tell you guys who it is anyway,&quot; the 
Shiba girl said with a grin, upon which the room groaned as one in 
disappointment.

&quot;Well,&quot; Yoruichi asked as she glanced at the trash now covering the 
carpet and debating whether or not to clean it up today (she decided to 
wait until tomorrow), &quot;...What do you guys wanna do now? I&#39;ve got a 
karaoke machine downstairs, and--&quot;

&quot;OOH! Karaoke drinking games!&quot; Kuukaku suggested enthusiastically, 
catching the guests by surprise.

&quot;Huh? Why do they have to be drinking games?&quot;

&quot;Alright, everyone downstairs!&quot; Rangiku yelled as she grabbed the three 
bottles of sake along with Kuukaku. &quot;Shunsui, grab some glasses!&quot;

&quot;Will do!&quot; he said as he headed for the kitchen, though his girlfriend 
gave him a look that told him that was going to be the extent of his 
proximity to alcohol tonight. As everyone rushed around the staircase to 
the door that lead to the stereo-equipped lower floor, Yoruichi gave a 
sigh that was equal parts annoyance and comprehension. At least she knew 
now why they&#39;d REALLY bought the sake.

----------

&quot;I&#39;m gonna go to bed, Dad.&quot;

&quot;So early?&quot; Soi&#39;s father asked as he turned from the TV and the 
lighthearted Christmas special that was currently occupying all their 
basic cable stations. &quot;...I guess if you want to, but didn&#39;t you have 
something planned for tonight?&quot;

&quot;...Where&#39;d you hear that?&quot; Soi asked as she froze, midway up the 
stairs.

&quot;Well, your friend Urahara-kun called earlier today-- he said to make 
sure that you were coming to Yoruichi&#39;s party.&quot;

Damnit, Soi cursed to herself as she walked down the steps just enough 
to make eye contact with her father. &quot;...Look, it&#39;s really no big deal. 
I told them earlier that I was going to be spending Christmas here, 
anyway. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re having plenty of fun without me.&quot;

&quot;But it sounded like your friends were expecting you, Soi! I didn&#39;t 
raise you to ignore people like that! Now if I know my daughter, which I 
can only hope I do,&quot; he insisted, not catching the way Soi flinched at 
the coming accusation, &quot;...I&#39;d say that you&#39;re not going because you 
feel guilty about something.&quot;

&quot;N-no...&quot; Soi muttered as she looked at the ground, not wanting to bring 
up her present for Yoruichi.

&quot;...Do you feel guilty about spending time with your father?&quot; At this 
she blinked, surprised, but before she could make a rebuttal the older 
man continued. &quot;You aren&#39;t obligated to spend EVERY Christmas with me, 
Soi. I know that you&#39;re getting older and you&#39;ve got other places you 
want to be at. Now what time&#39;s this party? If you go quickly then you 
might be able to at least apologize--&quot;

&quot;Dad, it&#39;s not that!&quot; Soi insisted, worried that her father might 
actually think, even for a minute, that she didn&#39;t care immensely for 
him. Before Yoruichi, she could&#39;ve easily said that there was no one 
else in her life nearly as important. &quot;I wanna spend time with you, 
and...&quot;

&quot;Soi, this is an order from your father,&quot; he said sternly even as his 
eyes held a bit of the teasing sparkle she&#39;d grown up familiar with, 
&quot;...You&#39;ve given me enough. Now go be with your friends.&quot; The freshman 
opened her mouth, then closed it again knowing it would be futile. In 
spite of herself she gave him a grateful hug before running upstairs to 
grab Yoruichi&#39;s present.

----------

The group was rolling on the ground by the time Kuukaku had slurred her 
way through the second verse of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; (more because it was 
quite the ironic song for the promiscuous teen, though the sake could 
have been partly to blame), and though Yoruichi giggled with all of them 
she was quickly getting bored. She glanced at her watch, feeling her 
good humor vanish as it flashed 8:53 at her in an almost taunting way. 
Feeling her hunger get the best of her she headed upstairs, past a 
surprisingly wasted Kisuke who was struggling to keep from falling 
asleep and mumbling something about cookies.

Yoruichi wasn&#39;t sure why Soi not showing up bothered her so much. It was 
true that she had known about her plans with her father and that getting 
to spend time with her in a situation like this probably wasn&#39;t the 
freshman&#39;s idea of fun, but even so it felt like something was holding 
her back from having a good time at an event that normally made her 
immensely happy. She&#39;d laughed with all of them, had gotten to spend 
time with people she&#39;d known far longer, but it just felt odd without 
the Chinese girl&#39;s fussbudget, almost maternal manner when it came to 
such unbecoming activities. It nearly made her laugh right there, just 
the thought of Soi&#39;s flustered expression, complaining that all of them 
were adults and should behave better.

She&#39;s so much like Kisuke when he was younger, Yoruichi thought fondly. 
But at the same time...

The upperclassman wasn&#39;t sure when she had wandered over to the window, 
breathing idly on the window and watching it fog up. She was in the 
middle of drawing an abstract picture when she noticed a familiar head 
of dark hair hidden below a woolen skullcap, an unmistakably skinny 
frame puffed out by a heavily padded coat, standing indecisively before 
the house in already ankle-deep snow. Something about Soi&#39;s posture 
seemed to say that she was seriously considering turning around, about 
leaving before she even arrived. Without the slightest bit of hesitation 
Yoruichi ran for her closet, grabbed her coat and gloves, then nearly 
headed out before remembering the small package stowed near the trunk of 
the illuminated tree.

----------

Soi shivered in the cold even through her coat, wishing more than 
anything that she&#39;d gotten a new one this year. she held the package in 
her hand, but even though she&#39;d come all this way and was probably 
destined to be sick tomorrow she still couldn&#39;t bring herself to give it 
to Yoruichi. It was such a meager, pathetic excuse for a gift. She 
deserved so much better than this.

She was about to drop the gift in the snow and run home when the last 
and first voice she wanted to hear sounded behind her.

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; The freshman turned around, cautiously, to find Yoruichi 
standing in the snow a few feet away, clad against the weather in a 
heavy peacoat and knee-high boots lined with faux fur, smiling brightly 
as if she really was happy to see her. Her face was already red from the 
chill, but other than that she seemed perfectly normal, the carefree 
girl she had known and silently adored for half a year. &quot;I gotta admit, 
I didn&#39;t think you were coming for a while!&quot;

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Yoruichi-san,&quot; Soi muttered to the snow beneath her feet, 
her face the color of a cherry in less time than normal. &quot;I-I-I was--&quot;

&quot;God, you&#39;re ALWAYS apologizing! I swear, you could&#39;ve at least called 
and TOLD me you&#39;d be late!&quot; Soi cringed in shame on reflex, but to her 
surprise Yoruichi&#39;s tone was far from reprimanding, and she rubbed a 
gloved hand on Soi&#39;s wool-covered head.

It amazed Yoruichi that no matter what Soi did she could never feel 
upset with her, and even though she should have been immensely angry 
with anyone else all she could do was keep smiling.

&quot;H-h-happy Birthday, Yoruichi-san...a-and Merry Christmas!&quot; Soi 
whispered as she instictively thrust the package out in front of her, 
knowing it was too late to back out now.

&quot;Ah, so you&#39;d rather do this out here? I was gonna invite you inside and 
give you some cake...&quot; Yoruichi said wistfully as she accepted the gift, 
taking off the wrapping carefully until she found its contents.

&quot;I...I know it&#39;s bad, but it was all I could afford and I really did try 
to find something ni--&quot;

&quot;Soi, it&#39;s adorable!&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi looked up, more from confusion than actual pride, to find 
Yoruichi holding the scarf covered with interwoven pictures of cats, 
looking at it fondly. &quot;R-really?&quot;

&quot;...Really,&quot; Yoruichi said earnestly as she quickly began wrapping the 
garment around her neck, feeling a warmth flow into her that had nothing 
to do with the scarf. Soi blushed again at the smile she recieved, 
thankful that she could at least blame it against the cold if it came to 
that. &quot;Oh,&quot; Yoruichi said out of the blue as she dug briefly in her 
pocket, pulling out a small box no bigger than her palm. &quot;Merry 
Christmas, Soi. Be careful, you don&#39;t wanna lose this again.&quot; The 
freshman cocked an eyebrow, wondering what she had meant until she 
pulled off the lid and nearly dropped the box in shock.

Inside, glittering like new, was the ruby necklace, as beautiful as it 
had been when Soi had first seen her mother put it on so long ago. It 
was obvious that a few of the diamonds had been lost from the scuffle 
with the would-be rapists, but they had been flawlessly replaced, and 
the silver was almost blinding in the low light of the nearby 
streetlamp.

&quot;H...&quot; Soi gasped, her brain struggling to find words, &quot;...How did 
you...&quot;

&quot;Well...Let&#39;s just say that I was looking for a while,&quot; Yoruichi joked 
as if combing the street at night for a tiny piece of jewelry was no big 
deal. &quot;...I know how much it meant to you and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get it 
back to you sooner, but the jeweler had it forever...and I didn&#39;t think 
you&#39;d wanna see it the way I found it.&quot;

Soi tried again to think of something to say, but words simply couldn&#39;t 
do justice to the wave of relief, of wholeness she felt having the last 
piece of her mother safely back in her hands, or the boundless gratitude 
she felt at this moment for Yoruichi. She couldn&#39;t believe that she&#39;d 
ever thought for a minute that she was bad, that there wasn&#39;t a shred of 
goodness in her. Even if the world turned against her again, Soi knew 
she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to defend her.

&quot;...Well, is it okay? I know it&#39;s not exactly your mom&#39;s anymore, but--&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi-san...&quot; The quiet tone of the petite girl&#39;s voice cut through 
the stillness of the evening, threw off the upperclassman&#39;s carefree 
equilibrium. Yoruichi looked at her friend intently, who was between 
looking her in the eye and glancing off at the nearest house to 
Yoruichi&#39;s.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s nothing,&quot; Soi whispered, her shoulders drooping as she began to 
leave. She couldn&#39;t do it, not even if the feelings she had for Yoruichi 
had suddenly become overwhelming, her heart beating dangerously fast as 
she struggled to maintain the self-control she&#39;d kept all her life and 
was just now threatening to overpower her. &quot;Merry Christmas...&quot;

&quot;Come on, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi insisted with an intrigued grin, grabbing her 
friend by the shoulder and turning her around, though the Chinese girl 
was still looking everywhere but at her. &quot;You can&#39;t just get all serious 
like that and then expect me to--&quot; In that instant Soi&#39;s eyes finally 
met hers, and the intensity of those silver orbs took away her easygoing 
manner as if it had never been there. For a moment both stood still in 
the cold snow, held by the other&#39;s gazes, before Yoruichi opened her 
mouth to speak.

As if afraid she would lose her nerve, Soi grabbed the older girl&#39;s 
shoulders and, rasing herself slightly on her toes, clamped her eyes 
shut and placed her lips on Yoruichi&#39;s.

It felt like an eternity before she slowly retreated, lids reluctantly 
opening as she tried to force herself back to cognizance and out of the 
warmth she&#39;d been dreaming about since a warm summer night months ago 
that only she remembered. All at once it hit her.

She&#39;d kissed Yoruichi. Lost control. It wasn&#39;t anything as simple as a 
slip of the tongue or an admission that she could brush off. There 
wasn&#39;t going to be any turning back. As if hoping against hope she 
slowly looked up.

It was worse than she thought. Yoruichi didn&#39;t appear to be happy, or 
angry, or even annoyed. She was just staring down at her, expression 
perfectly blank, almost like she hadn&#39;t seen Soi properly until just 
now. As if she&#39;d committed an unforgivable act the freshman pulled her 
hands away from their hold on Yoruichi&#39;s shoulders, took a step 
backwards, then stared at the ground as she did the only thing that came 
to mind and ran home at full speed.

She didn&#39;t know that Yoruichi had watched her, paralyzed, until she 
became a speck in the distance, or see the slight deepening of red on 
the upperclassman&#39;s face as she absentmindedly brushed a finger over her 
lips where Soi&#39;s had been just a moment ago.</pre>
