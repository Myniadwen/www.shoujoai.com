<pre>Notes: &#39; are thoughts and &quot; are speech

The midnight moon had just risen to the center of the night time sky, 
crickets played their musical melody to the night, owls hooted, and 
innocent little spiders spun their webs in the branches of the trees 
outside of the Kurosaki clinic. 

All was silent until a piercing shriek sounded through the night. Karin 
Kurosaki, who had been peacefully sleeping until then, was startled 
awake by the shriek. Karin instantly bolted up in bed as she heard 
another shriek. &quot;Yuzu?!&quot; Karin looked to the bed her twin should&#39;ve been 
asleep in, but found it empty. 

Karin was out of bed in a flash and out of her room into the hall, 
looking both ways to determine where she heard the shriek from. &#39;Where&#39;s 
dad when you actually need him?!&#39; Karin thought angrily. She didn&#39;t have 
enough time to assume his whereabouts as she heard Yuzu shriek again.

Karin followed the sound down the hall and down the stairs into the 
kitchen. There was Yuzu, standing on a chair as Karin came skidding into 
the kitchen, ready to bust the jaw of anybody trying to hurt her sister. 
&quot;Karin!&quot; Yuzu cried out, tears flowing down her face as she spotted her 
sister. &quot;What is it, Yuzu?&quot; Karin asked hastily as she surveyed the 
room, but saw no intruders. 

Yuzu said nothing, only shakily pointed to the counter. Karin walked 
over to the counter and peered down at the culprit of Yuzu&#39;s suffering, 
she visibly deflated as she got a closer look. &quot;A spider...&quot; Karin even 
sounded deflated. The spider started to scurry across the counter 
towards a crack in the wall, causing Yuzu to squeal in fright. &quot;Karin! 
Kill it!&quot; Karin was rather annoyed now that she knew what the real 
problem was, but Yuzu was obviously terrified of the spider, so Karin 
smacked it with her hand before it could escape.

As Karin went to the kitchen sink to wash off the dead spider, Yuzu 
literally jumped from the chair and onto Karin, causing both of them to 
fall to the floor in a heap. &quot;Yuzu! What&#39;s wrong with you?!&quot; Karin was 
really annoyed now. &quot;Karin, I was so scared!&quot; Yuzu cried, tears still 
flowing down her face as she buried her face into Karin&#39;s shoulder and 
cried.

Karin&#39;s annoyance vanished as she saw her sister break down crying like 
this, and then Karin realized what was wrong all along. &#39;Yuzu&#39;s 
arachnophobia...&#39; Karin had just remembered that Yuzu had always been 
senselessly afraid of spiders ever since she was young. &quot;Shhhh...&quot; Karin 
tried to calm Yuzu down by rubbing her head. &quot;Don&#39;t cry, Yuzu.&quot; However, 
she kept crying. 

&quot;C&#39;mon, lets get you back to bed,&quot; Karin said as she got up, pulling 
Yuzu up along with her and started back up the stairs towards their 
room. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Karin... I just got up for some water, and the spider 
was on the counter,&quot; Yuzu sniffled as she explained what happened to 
Karin. &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Karin said comfortingly. &quot;I&#39;m just glad nothing 
bad happened to you.&quot; Karin got the now calm Yuzu back to their room and 
tucked her back into bed. &quot;Thank you for getting rid of the spider, 
Karin,&#148; Yuzu said as a small watery smile appeared on her face. &quot;I&#39;ll 
always protect you Yuzu, always,&quot; Karin said as she leaned down and 
kissed Yuzu on the forehead. 

&quot;Goodnight.&quot; Karin then got back into her own bed but stayed on her side 
to keep a vigilant watch over her sister, who had fallen back asleep 
surprisingly fast. Karin smiled a secret smile that she always smiled 
when she watched over her sister. &#39;I&#39;ll always protect you...&#39;</pre>
