&quot;Aw, damnit!&quot;

Soi Fong brought herself back to cognizance at the sudden exclamation 
from Isane, who was busy now trying to shoot down a polar-bear doll from 
the shooting booths. With her ammunition expired, the short-haired girl 
dug in the small purse at her shoulder for more money, but being 
unsatisfied with what she found she simply sighed and handed the toy 
rifle back to the game operator.

&quot;Man... I really thought I&#39;d get that one. Figures, since I&#39;ve got no 
luck with these things anyway,&quot; the girl laughed at herself as she told 
this to Soi, who provided a light chuckle that died as soon as the 
Junior looked away. It wasn&#39;t that Isane was a bad person-- she seemed 
like a very nice girl to Soi, at least-- it was more that she wanted to 
get back to the group, back to Yoruichi... &quot;Hey, you having fun?&quot; Isane 
said loudly so she could be heard over the crowd.

&quot;Huh? ...Oh, yeah-- lots,&quot; Soi answered with a patronizing smile even as 
she continued to fervently wish she was somewhere else. She was a bit 
surprised when she noticed the silver-haired girl look in her direction 
oddly, then away when Soi took notice.

&quot;Y-yeah...me too,&quot; Isane said a bit quietly, feeling herself burn up as 
she inched just slightly closer to the younger girl. &quot;Hey, um... I was 
wondering...&quot; she said without warning after a long silence. 
&quot;...Y-you&#39;re not seeing anyone...are you?&quot; Soi nearly had a bitter laugh 
at that question-- she&#39;d never so much as been on a date in her life, 
let alone in a relationship. Instead, she contented herself with quietly 
shaking her head to the left and right. &quot;Oh really?&quot; Isane brightened 
instantly at the younger girl&#39;s response, her courage growing by the 
moment. &quot;Well, then... I... I know we don&#39;t know each other really well, 
but since we do go to the same school and all--&quot;

&quot;...What is it?&quot; Soi asked, a bit more impatient than she had meant to. 
Isane half wanted to turn tail and run, but at the same time knew that 
if she didn&#39;t do it now then she&#39;d probably never have the courage to 
try again. She took a deep breath, pushing the braid on her right side 
out of the way before continuing.

&quot;W-would you l-like to go out with me sometime?&quot;

Yoruichi stared absentmindedly at the small plate of raw fish wrapped in 
rice and seaweed, taking a small piece and rolling it between her thumb 
and forefinger before popping it casually into her mouth. It would have 
been easier if she knew what she was so upset about, but for some reason 
the answer seemed intent on evading her. Isane was a good girl, Yoruichi 
knew her pretty well, but that didn&#39;t stop her from wondering what she 
was doing with Soi Fong right now. They were all supposed to meet here a 
good ten minutes ago, but it was approaching fifteen when her friends 
got tired of waiting and decided to go ahead and start eating. She&#39;d 
tried to keep her frustration to herself, which was something she could 
very easily do most of the time but today she couldn&#39;t have witheld if 
she&#39;d wanted to-- Kisuke had noticed her rather sullen behavior (or 
rather the way-too-obvious degree of her false happiness) and asked her 
about it, but she had dismissed it as nothing.

&quot;...Doesn&#39;t seem like nothing,&quot; the boy said wisely as he grabbed one of 
his many dumpling skewers and put it on the girl&#39;s plate. Yoruichi 
pulled one of the dumplings off and swallowed it whole while Urahara 
took smaller bites of his. &quot;Are you worried about Soi?&quot; Yoruichi nearly 
choked on the second dumpling she was working on, but managed to ingest 
it before she answered.

&quot;...Well, if you must know, yes-- I am worried. She and Kotetsu 
should&#39;ve been here by now.&quot; Urahara raised an eyebrow slightly. It 
wasn&#39;t like Yoruichi at all to be so concerned about something so 
trivial, but he decided not to mention it to his friend; it was actually 
kind of nice to see that she did have some feelings beyond her 
frustratingly casual demeanor.

&quot;Oh, come on... You don&#39;t really think that they&#39;d--&quot;

&quot;Hey! People do crazy things at places like this,&quot; Yoruichi said as her 
eyes narrowed angrily. The thought of ANYONE doing something like THAT 
to her... she shook the thought away before continuing. &quot;...You come 
here and you get all friendly with someone, then you get slipped some 
drugs in your drink when you&#39;re not looki--&quot;

&quot;Good God, Yoruichi!&quot; the blonde teen said in a disturbed chuckle. 
&quot;...Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re getting a little...paranoid? And come on, 
this is Isane we&#39;re talking about-- she has nightmares about FOOD! She 
wouldn&#39;t try ANYTHING on Soi even if she DID like her.&quot; Yoruichi was 
quiet for a few moments, then let out a frustrated sigh.

&quot;...I guess so...&quot; she admitted even as she rolled her eyes. She was 
getting hysterical over nothing. This wasn&#39;t like her at all to be 
acting this way. Yeah, Isane wouldn&#39;t have the nerve to do anything, but 
even so... &quot;...I just don&#39;t want anyone hurting her--that&#39;s all,&quot; she 
muttered more to herself than Kisuke, although the latter heard her 
easily enough from his place beside her.

&quot;Oh, here you guys are!&quot; Yoruichi felt herself brighten against her will 
at the sound of Soi Fong&#39;s voice, felt her head turn a little too 
quickly to find her among the swarm of people enjoying the festival. The 
others noticed her and greeted her with casual or half-hearted 
salutations, as they were busy with their individual dinners to pay her 
any mind. &quot;Well, nice to see you guys, too...&quot; the freshman muttered as 
she walked past them and straight up to where Kisuke and Yoruichi were 
sitting, the latter of whom tried to hide the smile on her face for fear 
that she looked too happy.

&quot;Hey, kiddo!&quot; Urahara said with a grin as he held out his plate of 
snacks. &quot;...Dumpling?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no thanks, I--&quot;

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; Yoruichi&#39;s grin faded easily enough when Isane showed up 
just a second later, having gotten caught up in the crowd and lost sight 
of the Chinese girl on the way. &quot;...Sorry I lost you back there!&quot;

&quot;Oh...no, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Soi answered with a friendly wave. &quot;...I was 
just going to go over there and get some ramen,&quot; she indicated a small 
noodle stand not far from where they were sitting.

&quot;Well, could I g--&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll go,&quot; Yoruichi said faster than she had meant to, shoving her 
half-eaten plate of sushi near Kisuke. &quot;...I was getting kinda hungry 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;O-okay,&quot; Soi answered hesitantly once she&#39;d had a moment to recover 
from the shock of her sempai&#39;s presence again. &quot;Isane, could you save us 
some space?&quot; Yoruichi was ready to tell the Junior to go sit on her own 
and leave Soi alone, but instead she kept her mouth shut and headed off 
with her younger friend. Isane barely had time to answer before the 
girls were beyond earshot, so she merely gave a disappointed sigh and 
plopped down on the bench next to Urahara.

&quot;I&#39;d like an order of curry ramen, please,&quot; Soi indicated to the man 
behind the counter.

&quot;...Make that two,&quot; the older girl added once she&#39;d looked over the 
menu. She handed the chef money for both orders, then plopped onto the 
stool beside Soi Fong. &quot;So,&quot; she said with a smile as she glanced at her 
friend, &quot;...Sorry we ditched you like that...I didn&#39;t want to, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Oh...That&#39;s okay,&quot; Soi muttered as she felt her face burn up again, and 
not just because of the steam coming from behind the small curtain 
before them. &quot;...It wasn&#39;t too bad with Isane, though. We DID have some 
fun.&quot; Yoruichi felt a little agitated at hearing Soi mention that girl, 
but she decided to ignore it. Why was the idea of Soi with Isane so 
upsetting to her? Maybe she was just jealous of the fact that since the 
freshman had been around her so often that being around another person 
was surprising. &quot;...Actually, Yoruichi-san?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah?&quot; Yoruichi asked as the chef reappeared with their order, 
giving the first bowl to Soi and the second to the upperclassman.

&quot;Well, I wanted to ask...your advice about something.&quot; Yoruichi said 
nothing, she simply nodded at her friend, indicating that she was 
prepared to listen to what she wanted to say. &quot;...See, Isane asked me on 
a...on a date-- Are you okay!&quot; Soi exclaimed in the middle of her 
statement when she saw Yoruichi choking on her ramen. She reached out to 
help, but the upperclassman stopped her with an outstretched palm. Once 
she could breathe again, Soi repeated her question, to which Yoruichi 
put on a wide smile and said she was fine.

&quot;J...just go on with your...with what you were saying,&quot; Yoruichi said 
even as she was trying to recover from her brush with death.

&quot;...Well...What should I do?&quot; Yoruichi again felt something in her gut 
urge her to tell Soi to leave Isane alone, but she was able to silence 
it even though it was harder than before to ignore it. God, what was 
wrong with her?

&quot;Hmm...&quot; The older woman hummed as she resumed her eating. &quot;...I guess 
you should just do what you feel is right, Soi.&quot; The girl felt a little 
bit disappointed by her friend&#39;s answer, by her ambiguity. She had 
almost hoped that Yoruichi would tell her what to do, give her something 
specific to mull over. But then, obviously this wasn&#39;t something 
Yoruichi could instruct her in, like with Karate or how to fend off 
bullies. She&#39;d be flying solo in this decision. She was about to say 
something to the now silent Yoruichi when a tall glass bottle landed on 
the counter between them with a dull smack. The two girls turned to see 
Kuukaku holding the neck of the bottle and about four others like it in 
the crook of her other arm.

&quot;Hey, Yoruichi...Look what I got!&quot; the tactless girl said with a crooked 
smile as she indicated the label, and upon closer inspection Yoruichi 
realized what Kuukaku had acquired.

&quot;...Sake?&quot;

&quot;You bet yer ass it is! Sure, it cost a mint...but it&#39;s for a very 
special occasion...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Yoruichi asked skeptically, knowing the answer even before she 
prepared to ask. &quot;...And what would that be?&quot;

&quot;Drinking. Contest. You and me-- right here and right now!&quot; With that, 
Kuukaku pulled out a pair of small drinking glasses from her pocket and 
slammed them on the counter in succession, then shoved herself between 
Soi and Yoruichi.

&quot;Hey!&quot; the freshman exclaimed as her ramen bowl fell to the grass and 
spilled its contents out with abandon, but Kuukaku took no notice of her 
and Yoruichi hadn&#39;t heard over the din of the surrounding chaos.

&quot;Ahh...I think I&#39;m gonna pass, Kuukaku. I&#39;m not really in the mood to be 
drinking,&quot; Yoruichi said with false regret as she glanced in Soi&#39;s 
direction.

&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Kuukaku chuckled as she popped the top on one of the 
bottles, letting the rice wine air out slightly before she served it. 
&quot;...You said we were all gonna get drunk this week, but I know you 
haven&#39;t had so much as a drop since we&#39;ve been here. Now you and me are 
gonna down shots &#39;til we puke or I&#39;m gonna beat you up!&quot; Yoruichi gave 
her a look that said she didn&#39;t think that was even close to possible, 
but before she could ask Soi if she wanted to leave she heard the voice 
she&#39;d come to abhor over the last five days.

&quot;Hey, Soi Fong!&quot; There was Isane again, looking at Soi with that warm 
glow in her eyes, offset by a rather deep blush that the object of her 
affections didn&#39;t notice. &quot;...Ready to keep going?&quot;

&quot;W-well, actually, I...&quot; Soi began but was surprised when she felt 
Isane&#39;s fingers around her wrist, pulling her so hard that she feared 
her arm might be removed.

&quot;Come on, we can still check out some of the shops before fireworks 
start!&quot; Yoruichi glared as she watched Isane drag Soi off (clearly 
against the girl&#39;s will), then flinched when Kuukaku spoke out of 
nowhere.

&quot;Hmph-- Isane sure wants to get th&#39; kid in the sack, eh?&quot;

&quot;Jeez,&quot; Yoruichi grumbled as she stirred the bowl of noodles before her 
with her chopsticks, &quot;...Why the hell is an upperclassman so interested 
in her, anyway? I don&#39;t like it.&quot;

&quot;...Look who&#39;s talking.&quot;

Yoruichi&#39;s eyes snapped towards Kuukaku, an accusing glint to her hard 
gaze.

&quot;...What the hell is THAT supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Nothin&#39;,&quot; the Shiba girl said casually, but Yoruichi caught the 
taunting grin on her face. Was Kuukaku implying that she was... Of 
course not. There was no way it could be that. She liked Soi a lot, that 
was true, but it was more of a filial sort of affection... the only 
reason she didn&#39;t like Isane was because she just wanted to make sure 
Soi was safe...right? She was interrupted from her musings by her friend 
speaking again, lifting the liter of sake with her as she did so.

&quot;Well, if you&#39;d rather just sit here, I can find someone else willing to 
play--&quot; Before she could finish, Yoruichi yanked her into a stool and 
set the glasses so that one was in front of each of them. She was 
thinking too much about all this-- a few drinks wouldn&#39;t hurt at this 
point.

&quot;Fine-- let&#39;s get started.&quot; Kuukaku grinned as she turned the open 
bottle end-over-end, pouring both half a glassful.

&quot;So...&quot; Isane asked as soon as they were alone (and by &#39;alone&#39; that 
meant away from anyone who knew them), &quot;...You said you&#39;d think about... 
about g-going out... well, what do you wanna do?&quot; Soi hesitated before 
she answered. She had been giving this a lot of thought since Isane had 
asked her, but even so she knew that her answer wasn&#39;t going to change.

&quot;...Kotetsu-san...&quot; Soi began after a steadying breath, &quot;...I really do 
think that you&#39;re a nice person... but I just don&#39;t think I want to go 
on a date.&quot;

&quot;...Oh...&quot; Soi felt guilty as she watched Isane&#39;s cheerful demeanor 
disappear like water turning to steam, but at the same time she felt 
slightly liberated-- like she was glad for being honest with herself.

&quot;I...I&#39;m really sorry...&quot;

&quot;No, t-that&#39;s okay,&quot; the Junior answered with a bit too wide of a smile. 
Even so, she didn&#39;t speak for a little while, and didn&#39;t seem as intent 
on looking at Soi as she had before. The freshman thought for a moment 
that Isane didn&#39;t want to talk to her anymore, but without warning the 
tomboyish-looking girl spoke again. &quot;...Is there someone else? That 
you&#39;re interested in, I mean.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh...&quot; Soi pursed her lips for a moment, not sure what the answer 
to that question was. &quot;...I...I guess so...&quot; she muttered as Yoruichi 
popped into her head.

&quot;...Is it Yorui--&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; It wasn&#39;t the denial that had surprised Soi so much as the volume 
with which she had declared it-- some people passing by stopped what 
they were doing just to look at her, a few of whom were whispering rude 
things about her. &quot;...I mean...&quot; Soi managed as her face burned red, her 
dark eyes darting around in confusion. There were so many thoughts 
running through her mind all of a sudden, some of them troubling while 
others were confusing and still more were strangely pleasant and 
warming.

&quot;...I...I need to be alone for a little while,&quot; Soi said in a 
half-whisper as she rejected Isane&#39;s outstretched hand and headed off 
into the crowd as fast as her feet could move her.

Soi wasn&#39;t sure where she was now, just that she had wandered to the 
outskirts of the festival, where there were a few late families making 
their way to the lawn where the fireworks were going to be and couples 
in their own little worlds, talking in whispered tones barely a few 
inches from each other&#39;s face. She glanced at them dejectedly, annoyed 
with the way they seemed oblivious to everything around them, how they 
wasted their time with feelings that weren&#39;t going to last beyond high 
school anyway. Sure, it was rather spiteful and prejudiced of her to 
think that, but right now she just felt so frustrated, not just with 
herself but with this confusion saturating her consciousness that she 
wanted to take out her venom on anyone who walked by-- they were all 
eligible to be condemned by the jury of her mind right now. She was just 
about to look back at the booths when she saw something that caught her 
eye.

There were two girls walking up the path-- one was taller with her long 
hair in a bun, the other was a bit shorter and had rather cute pigtails 
that hung over her shoulders, but both were clad in matching yukata. Soi 
tried to look away, but there was something about them that made her 
keep watching-- no sort of attraction, she just felt compelled see what 
happened. Suddenly the shorter girl limped and as if she could have seen 
it coming, her tall companion grabbed her by the arm to prevent a fall. 
She bent down and lifted up the hem of her robe for just a moment, but 
Soi saw the violent red burn on her ankle-- almost as if she&#39;d been 
attacked. The tall girl spoke to her friend with concerned eyes, making 
a few gestures in the direction they had come. The shorter one gave a 
brave sort of smile, shaking her head and acting like the injury (or 
whatever it was the tall girl had mentioned) wasn&#39;t a big deal. The tall 
one gave a slight sigh, then put an arm around her companion. Soi smiled 
to herself, the gesture reminding her of Yoruichi. She thought for a 
minute that they must have been sisters until the taller one leaned down 
and planted a kiss right on the other&#39;s lips.

Suddenly Soi knew exactly what they were. She tried to look away, 
pretend she hadn&#39;t noticed, but suddenly they returned her mind&#39;s eye, 
but this time it was different. It was her and Yoruichi instead. In an 
instant Soi remembered why she had run from Isane in the first place, 
why she was now walking about the festival alone. She felt so different 
than she had before she&#39;d left for the trip, and no matter how many 
times she had tried to assure herself otherwise she knew Yoruichi was at 
the center of it. God, this was ridiculous! She couldn&#39;t have feelings 
for Yoruichi... even though she was happier with her than she had ever 
been in her life, even though there was this strange longing deep in the 
pit of her stomach when she looked at her, even though she was feeling 
all these things that usually identified at the very least with the 
symptoms of a crush.

It was just adolescent confusion; she&#39;d heard about stuff like this 
before, where a shy girl would think she was in love with another girl, 
but once they became more outgoing they grew out of it, like it was 
simply a phase. Those two women she&#39;d seen before probably weren&#39;t even 
real-- just a hallucination caused by an overworked and troubled mind. 
She just needed more time to relax, more time away from Yoruichi. That 
would set her straight. But, as destiny seemed intent on proving her 
wrong since the day she&#39;d set foot in high school, she encountered 
something other than peace of mind that night.

Soi jumped as she heard the snapping of a twig out in the trees to her 
right. She almost ignored it, but then she noticed the flash of lantern 
light on a lavender yukata.

Is that...? Sure enough, she followed it a little further to find her 
sempai, strewn out on the grass with her robe askew on her.

&quot;Y...Yoruichi?&quot;

&quot;Hhhhheyyy, Ssssoi Fffonngh!&quot; Yoruichi managed to say after a few 
moments of blank-eyed staring, her face flush and a stupidly happy grin 
on her face. Soi flinched when the overpowering stench of alchol hit her 
from Yoruichi&#39;s breath, but recovered when the older girl tried to stand 
and only ended up tripping over her own leg. Soi was about to ask if she 
was hurt when Yoruichi suddenly began laughing.

&quot;Th...that wassss fuuhnnn!&quot; the dark-skinned girl yelled even as she 
tried half-heartedly to stop giggling. &quot;Ddddid yyya ssshheee 
me...f...fall justtt nnnowwww!&quot; Soi gave out an exasperated sigh as she 
leaned down and picked up one of Yoruichi&#39;s limp arms, grunting as she 
forced it around her neck for support.

&quot;J...just how much d...did you drink, Yoruichi?&quot; Soi growled through her 
teeth, straining to at least get the drunken woman on her feet, which 
she seemed utterly unwilling to do.

&quot;Y...Yeh sssshheeee thhhat, Kkkuuuukakku?&quot; Yoruichi slurred victoriously 
to no one in particular. &quot;I wwwonnn agggaain! Ya ddddumm 
bbbitsssssch...&quot;

&quot;...Just try to...there...&quot; the freshman said with a bit of relief as 
she gave a strong tug and felt some of Yoruichi&#39;s weight disappear as 
she clumsily regained some semblance of balance. To her added relief, 
Yoruichi didn&#39;t speak for a little bit, just mumbling to herself and 
occasionally hiccupping.

Jeez, Soi thought as she continued to support Yoruichi by what barely 
passed as her strength. She didn&#39;t know what had made Yoruichi so 
appealing in her eyes before-- in situations like this one, she could be 
so childish, so careless-- not to mention that she wasn&#39;t terribly 
mature to begin with, always teasing, smiling, treating life like it was 
just a big game to her...

&quot;...Wherrre th&#39; hell&#39;sssss...Issssanne? Aaarrren&#39;t yyyou goin&#39; out 
w...with that lllittle sk...litttle skank?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Soi asked with a cocked eyebrow. Why would she bring that up at a 
time like this? &quot;...I don&#39;t know. I kinda left after I told her &#39;no.&#39;&quot;

&quot;...Ttthhhat&#39;s...ggggoood...&quot; Yoruichi mumbled, but it didn&#39;t surprise 
Soi nearly as much as what she said next.

&quot;Ttthhat&#39;s what tttthe bitssssch gggets for t-trrryin&#39; ta take ya awayyy 
frrrrem me.&quot;

Soi nearly dropped Yoruichi right there, but before she even had a 
chance to be shocked the older girl suddenly shoved her against the 
trunk of a nearby tree. The freshman winced slightly from the impact on 
her back and was about to chew her drunken friend out when Yoruichi 
leaned in, her face barely an inch from the younger girl&#39;s, her hands 
pressed flat on the bark around Soi&#39;s head for support. Soi instantly 
froze up, Yoruichi&#39;s proximity suddenly and inexplicably rendering her 
unable to form a cognizant thought.

&quot;Y...Yoruichi-san...&quot; she managed after a few tense moments staring into 
those unfocused golden eyes before her. She couldn&#39;t remember what she 
had thought wasn&#39;t attractive about Yoruichi just a moment ago, all she 
knew was that all the blood in her body was rushing directly to her 
face. &quot;...L-let me move...&quot; she said weakly even as she knew she didn&#39;t 
want to go anywhere.

&quot;Nnnnnuh-uhhh,&quot; Yoruichi said lazily as her head lolled back and forth, 
a slow smile creeping onto her lips as she said it. &quot;...Y...yyya neeeed 
ta rrrrememmmmber wwwho yyyya...wwwwho&#39;s gggggonnna lllloook afffta&#39; 
yyyeeeww...&quot; The upperclassman stumbled a little bit, bringing face even 
closer to her prisoner&#39;s. Soi felt her pulse race, a sudden desire 
reducing her thoughts to nothing as the memory of the two girls 
reappeared in her mind with her and Yoruichi in their places.

&quot;...Yerrrr...mmmy Ssssoi Fonnng...&quot; the older girl stumbled through the 
words like she was lost in a fog, and Soi could smell the rice wine on 
her breath even more than before but Yoruichi&#39;s closeness was making it 
almost pleasant, like it was an integral part of the woman&#39;s scent.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi-san...l-l-listen...you&#39;re drunk, you&#39;re saying th-things you 
don&#39;t m--...&quot; But she never does get a chance to finish that sentence 
when out of nowhere Yoruichi instantly closes the gap between them.

For a moment Soi can&#39;t think; all she can do is stare wide-eyed at 
nothing in particular as she feels Yoruichi&#39;s lips on hers. She had 
never thought about what her first kiss would feel like, but she hadn&#39;t 
thought for a moment it would happen like this: pinned to a tree by a 
girl three years older than her, that dark mouth pressed so hard on her 
delicate one that she&#39;s almost afraid there&#39;ll be a bruise afterwards. 
Almost. Yoruichi manages, with great difficulty considering her 
intoxication, to move a hand from her support onto Soi&#39;s face, her 
fingertips running down from the cheek in a surprisingly fluid motion. 
The sensation is suddenly more than Soi can handle, she trembles against 
her will, unaware that she still needs to breathe as she weakens, her 
eyelids slowly drooping as she runs out of oxygen. Yoruichi&#39;s lips 
become rather unfocused as the kiss lingers, and she slowly begins to 
drift to the left, her lips no longer fused to her younger friend&#39;s but 
Soi remains petrified as though they were. As quickly as it had happened 
the older girl suddenly withdrawls, pulling her face away from Soi with 
that incoherent grin still on her features.

&quot;...Thhhherrre wwwe gggho...Y-yahh knowwww thtttthat yyya ttthalk ttoooo 
musshsh, Ssssoi.&quot; All the other girl can do is gasp for breath as she 
suddenly remembers her body&#39;s need for air, but whether her 
breathlessness is the result of Yoruichi&#39;s kiss or being deprived of 
oxygen for nearly two minutes is unknown to her. She tries to get her 
now uncooperative brain to work again, to move as she knows she should, 
but the only thing she&#39;s aware of is the taste of Yoruichi&#39;s lips-- the 
sweet flavor of sake mixed with the spicy tang of curry. Suddenly the 
stench of alcohol is far from abhorrent to her; its presence on Yoruichi 
almost makes it intoxicating in and of itself, like she was being bathed 
in pheromones, inhaling the most powerful of love potions. Yoruichi 
slowly makes her way forward once more and all Soi can do is close her 
eyes and part her lips, surrendering to the euphoria that had 
overwhelmed her senses and that wanted to taste Yoruichi again and again 
and again... but instead of that softness on her mouth she feels 
Yoruichi&#39;s forehead collide with hers, then the older girl loses her 
balance and falls in a heap to the ground.

The bump on her head takes another moment to break the spell on Soi, 
who&#39;s brought back to Earth almost painfully as she rubs the sore spot. 
Slowly, as if coming out of a fog, she realizes what just happened and 
her eyes threaten to pop out of her head.

She... Yoruichi just...

The older girl&#39;s most recent act came out in a low whisper, Soi almost 
afraid that if she said it out loud it would be undone. But she wanted 
it to be undone...didn&#39;t she? Yoruichi had been drunk, she reminded 
herself. If she had known what she was doing, she would never have 
kissed her...right? Why would anyone so wonderful and beautiful want to 
be that close to her? But she&#39;d said her name... she&#39;d said her name and 
smiled as she did it. Slowly, almost timidly, Soi glanced at Yoruichi&#39;s 
now unconscious form, heard her throaty snoring as she lay on the grass 
face up. All of a sudden Soi found herself on top of the sleeping woman, 
her heart pounding and eyes glittering with awakened desire. She wanted 
to kiss Yoruichi again, wanted it so badly she didn&#39;t care if the other 
was cognizant enough to feel it or not. Soi knew as she dreamily closed 
her eyes and moved in that this was definitely not a crush, that it 
wasn&#39;t a case of confused sexual identity-- the longing burning within 
her was far too strong to be something as simple as that.

... So perfect... Soi though happily as she felt her bottom lip make 
contact with that flawless mouth, wanting more than anything for 
Yoruichi to wake up and just have her right there...

&quot;Hey, Yoruichi! Are you out here?&quot; Soi jumped away from Yoruichi&#39;s inert 
form as though she had been burned, a sudden sense of shame and fear 
overwhelming her as Urahara&#39;s voice drifted in her direction. She 
stumbled back a few paces, forcing herself to look away even as she 
wants to stare at Yoruichi in all her glory. She heard Kisuke call a 
second time, and once she had regained a bit of her sanity the freshman 
answered him.

&quot;O-over here! Urahara-san!&quot; A few minutes later she saw the blonde teen 
approach her, stumbling through the half-darkness just as the flash of 
fireworks lit up the night, the rumble of the explosions little more 
than pops at this distance.

&quot;Oh, there she is,&quot; Kisuke said in a tone that was both relieved and 
agitated. &quot;...What are you doing out here, kid?&quot; he queried to the 
freshman a few feet from him.

&quot;W-well...&quot; Soi began, uncertain if she wanted to lay out in detail the 
events that had lead her to this point. In the end, she decided against 
it. &quot;...I just kind of noticed her out here, so I tried to get her back. 
What happened?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Kuukaku got her to join in a drinking contest-- she always goes too 
damn far with these things. Well,&quot; the upperclassman said in a grunt as 
he bent down and draped his friend&#39;s limp arms around his neck for 
support, then stood up and held her legs so that she was straddling his 
back, &quot;...I guess we&#39;d better get her home.&quot;

&quot;Well, what about the others...?&quot; Soi asked as they began to trudge 
toward the entrance to the festival.

&quot;Oh, they&#39;ll be fine. They&#39;re probably just gonna head back once the 
fireworks are done, anyway.&quot; A flash of green and blue illuminated the 
woods as he said this, giving the duo just enough light to find their 
way out. &quot;Man, I tell you what, Yoru-chan gets pretty crazy when she&#39;s 
drunk,&quot; the young man said with a chuckle as he hoisted her up a little 
more, to avoid losing his grip.

&quot;Y...yeah...&quot; Soi agreed absentmindedly, the events of the last few 
minutes already playing in her head again.

&quot;Hey, you look a little shaken,&quot; Kisuke noted as he glanced at Soi&#39;s 
rather pale face. &quot;...She didn&#39;t DO anything to you before she conked 
out, did she?&quot; The freshman blushed as the sensation of Yoruichi&#39;s soft 
lips invaded her thoughts, accompanied by the lingering flavor of sake 
on her tongue...

&quot;N-n-no,&quot; Soi muttered, trying not to act guilty even though she was 
staring at the grass, at anything to avoid looking Kisuke straight in 
the eye. The boy sensed that something was wrong, however, but he let 
the matter drop as they headed back to the beach house.

Soi Fong stared at her coffee cup early the next morning, the steam 
slowly rising from its inscrutable dark surface making an unbroken flow 
of erratic white that stained the air. Everyone else was still asleep, 
after having gotten back from the fireworks display long after midnight, 
but the freshman&#39;s mind refused to allow her the same degree of 
restfulness today. She had too much on her mind even after she and 
Kisuke had gotten Yoruichi to bed to even consider sleep an option.

Yoruichi... Soi thought as she glanced at her untouched drink, gazing at 
the dark brown color that was so beautiful, so much like HER skin and 
would probably taste even sweeter than the coffee... she stopped herself 
before the fantasy could continue, but then felt slightly empty instead. 
She&#39;d hoped that some time alone would help her to sort out the 
cluttered space of her mind, but it had been a pipe dream: all she did 
now was think about Yoruichi, the kiss replaying in her mind over and 
over like a broken record. But no matter how many times she relived it 
the feelings refused to fade; in fact if anything they seemed to grow 
more intense with each recollection. It was this perfect mix of desire 
and tenderness and passion and joy that made her completely content but 
at the same time made her long for Yoruichi all the more, just so that 
she could catch another taste of the heaven that was her lips.

&quot;Uhhhgh...&quot; Soi&#39;s heart jumped as she heard Yoruichi behind her, but she 
stopped from turning around, not wanting to look too eager to see her. 
She probably didn&#39;t remember what happened last night, after all.

&quot;H-hi, Yoruichi-san,&quot; the freshman said as casually as she could, given 
that her pulse was running a marathon right now. God, even in the 
morning, hung over with her hair mussed up and dark bags under her 
golden eyes, Yoruichi was still breathtakingly gorgeous, still flawless 
and exacting in her movements.

Still a Goddess.

&quot;M...mornin&#39;...&quot; Yoruichi managed through a yawn as she stumbled over to 
the coffee pot, pouring herself a cup as she grabbed a small bottle of 
aspirin from the counter. Once she had finished with her coffee the 
older girl went about popping the child-proof top, finally sighing 
victoriously as her strength overwhelmed the container. She popped a few 
of the small white tablets, then glanced over to notice Soi gazing at 
her, apparently transfixed. &quot;...What?&quot; the girl asked a little more 
irritably than she had meant to, at which the freshman immediately 
turned away.

&quot;S-sorry,&quot; the younger girl mumbled shyly even though she wasn&#39;t, trying 
to stop herself from wanting to run up to Yoruichi and kiss her and only 
just barely succeeding. She wanted to caress that tired face, wanted to 
lay her on a soft bed and watch her as she drifted into sleep, wanted to 
be content with just being Yoruichi&#39;s friend. But it was too late for 
that, and she realized that it had been too late for that ever since 
she&#39;d first looked at Yoruichi. But at least now the confusion was gone, 
replaced instead with a truth that she was more certain about than 
anything else in her life.

She was in love with Yoruichi. In love with her teasing and her peerless 
beauty and her sly grins and the way her eyes narrowed when she smiled 
and the way she sounded when she was sick and could barely speak, in 
love with how soft her lips were and how right she made her feel when 
they were together. She even loved her when she was tired and cranky 
like this, when she looked like she might slug anyone who got anywhere 
near her bad side. Yoruichi had been absolutely right last night-- Soi 
WAS hers now. She was completely and utterly devoted to this woman, and 
no one in the world could change that in the slightest now.

&quot;...Ah, man...&quot; Yoruichi groaned as she gripped her forehead, rubbing it 
gingerly where less than twelve hours ago she had literally bumped heads 
with Soi, &quot;...What the hell happened to me last night?&quot;

Soi blushed and pretended to be interested in the design on her mug, not 
sure she wanted to answer that question just yet.</pre>
