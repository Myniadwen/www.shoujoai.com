&quot;Wow, look at them!&quot;

&quot;You know, I always thought they looked good together-- &#39;bout time they 
hooked up.&quot;

&quot;Yeah-- weren&#39;t they friends since kindergarten or somethin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Man, she&#39;s all OVER him; maybe they&#39;ll get started right here in the 
hallway...&quot;

&quot;Ha-- we can only hope...Geez, I&#39;d give ANYTHING to be in that Urahara&#39;s 
shoes right now...&quot;

Soi put her lunch down as calmly as she could, walked out of the 
classroom slowly even though she knew no one in the room would notice 
her missing; they were all too busy gossiping about the couple that had 
just walked by. She was grateful that the bathroom was close, almost as 
much as she was that Yoruichi and Kisuke had turned the corner, equally 
unaware of her presence. Even if it was only a few feet away the girl 
ran for the lavatory door, pushing it open and forcing her way into the 
nearest unlocked stall. She sat down on the toilet, cupping her face in 
small hands as if to forcibly tear the words of her classmates out of 
her head but to no avail. The freshman wanted to scream, to punch the 
nearest person as hard as she could, but as strong as those desires were 
she knew that only one person deserved the heartbreak, the wrenching 
pain in her chest she was just barely enduring.

She was.

She couldn&#39;t help wondering why Yoruichi had done it, or rather what SHE 
had done that made Yoruichi lose interest in her so quickly. But then 
she could think of a million reasons why-- not the least of which was 
her utter lack of experience in the world of... adult activities. Had 
she been so terrible that Yoruichi had instantly regretted it? Or maybe 
she had moved too fast afterwards, letting herself believe that there 
was a connection between sex and love-- that Yoruichi&#39;s physical 
affection indicated anything more than just what she presented.

It didn&#39;t make sense-- she&#39;d FELT something connect them that handful of 
days ago, something more than just their year of friendship, something 
real and good. But what did she know about that, about love in general, 
when the only person she&#39;d ever even had a crush on was Yoruichi?

And Urahara... who was she to think that compared to him-- a man who&#39;d 
known her practically all his life-- she ever had any hope of being 
loved by her?

&quot;...Fong?&quot; The freshman snapped out of her meditative state to find 
Kuukaku standing in the threshold of her stall, and before she could 
snap at the older girl for invading her privacy she realized that she&#39;d 
neglected to lock the door.

&quot;S-sorry...I-I&#39;m done if you w-w-wanna u-use it...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re crying.&quot; Soi lifted a hand to her face to find that there were, 
in fact, tears slowly making their way down her cheeks; she hadn&#39;t even 
realized that she was doing it until now. She didn&#39;t notice the normally 
uncouth girl hesitantly reach out a hand for her-- worry etched on her 
impassive face-- as she forced herself past, brushing the saltwater off 
her face with her sleeve hard enough to brush the memories they 
represented away, if they too had been so fragile. &quot;Soi...&quot; The Shiba 
girl called, slightly biting her lip at the unintended use of her first 
name, &quot;...I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a mistake-- Yoruichi wouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Soi whispered as she paused near the door, not wanting 
to show her face if she was still crying. &quot;...It was me.&quot; Without 
another word Soi left, praying she wouldn&#39;t run into Yoruichi and 
her...boyfriend...again anytime soon. She didn&#39;t think she could be 
silent for much longer.

----------

&quot;...Bye, Kisuke. I&#39;ll see you tonight for dinner, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; The blonde muttered as she leaned forward to kiss him, and 
though his heart skipped at the contact it sunk just as much at the 
knowledge of the artificiality of its &#39;affectionate&#39; nature. She let her 
fingers slide along his arm as she broke contact, gave him a suggestive 
wink as she walked off, as if she was deliberately putting on a show for 
whoever happened to be watching. As he turned around he caught a glimpse 
of Soi Fong, walking as fast as she could in the opposite exit, fighting 
against the crowd as her braid-rings clinked together.

He&#39;d had his suspicions fairly early about those two. He&#39;d never seen 
Yoruichi so genuinely friendly with someone before, so honest...well, as 
honest as she was capable of being at any case. He&#39;d always hoped 
Yoruichi would look at him that way one day, and even though it hurt to 
see someone else as the subject of that unspoken affection he&#39;d tried to 
encourage it, the better to help himself let go of the infatuation. But 
this... he knew none of Yoruichi&#39;s love was present in her actions and 
yet he&#39;d wanted this for so long part of him wanted to believe it. It 
was what had kept him from bringing this up with Yoruichi, after all.

----------

The Shihouin girl, too busy rifling through her locker for her books, 
didn&#39;t notice Kuukaku behind her, didn&#39;t have a chance to speak as she 
turned around to suddenly find a fist in her face that sent her tumbling 
backwards into the metal closet with a crash. Instinctively she brushed 
her hand over her face to find no blood had been spilt, only a pulsing 
bruise on her cheek, but before she could do anything else she felt two 
strong hands grab her collar and pull her up, forcing her to look into 
the eyes of a very angry young woman.

&quot;WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!&quot; Yoruichi didn&#39;t answer right away, 
choosing instead to look slightly to the left of her friend so as to 
avoid the full fury of her gaze.

&quot;...I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Kuukaku. Now let go of m--&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that &#39;I-don&#39;t-know&#39; bullshit,&quot; the Shiba daughter growled 
dangerously. &quot;What happened to all that about protecting her, or were 
you just blowing hot air THEN too?!&quot; Yoruichi wanted to push Kuukaku 
back, but at the same time part of her knew she deserved it. She could 
deal with a few minutes of demanding on Soi&#39;s behalf. &quot;Jesus Christ, 
Yoruichi...it&#39;d be just like you to fuck someone and ditch &#39;em, but how 
could you do that to HER?!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s nothing special. She&#39;s just a stupid girl.&quot; Kuukaku flinched at 
Yoruichi&#39;s words, almost as surprised as she was for saying them. But 
she was getting angry now, the reminder of her actions stirring 
something painful in the pit of her frozen heart. She tried to extricate 
herself from Kuukaku&#39;s grip but the girl only held tighter, her eyes 
mere slits as she glared daggers at Yoruichi.

&quot;You expect me to believe that?! She wasn&#39;t just another one of your 
toys and you KNOW it!&quot;

Yoruichi felt her eyes widen at the words, so true they hurt to be said 
aloud. But she couldn&#39;t be weak, couldn&#39;t afford to regret her decision. 
It was over, finished.

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn what you believe,&quot; The dark-skinned girl whispered 
coldly as she put a strong hand on Kuukaku&#39;s, forcing her to relinquish 
her grip. &quot;...When did you ever care who I slept with?&quot;

Kuukaku bit her lip just slightly at the question, burying the small bit 
of compassion for Soi she had, unable to answer. In her remaining fury 
Kuukaku shoved Yoruichi back into the wall of lockers, then shot the 
Shihouin a look that would&#39;ve killed her instantly if such an act was 
possible.

&quot;...You&#39;re a goddamned liar, Yoruichi.&quot; Before the bronze girl could 
protest Kuukaku had gone, leaving a rather bruised senior to deal with 
her injuries, both corporeal and invisible. This had become such a mess, 
but it&#39;d be over soon. Soon she&#39;d be going to the U.S., and she wouldn&#39;t 
have to think about anyone for a long time.

This is for the best, she told herself again, at the same time a little 
bothered by how much the phrase had begun to sound like a lie already.

----------

It ended up being nine days total before Zhou Fong was given permission 
to return home. With his car still in the repair shop, and Soi unable to 
drive in either case they took a cab, him constantly expressing his 
gratitude at finally being free from &#39;that den of butchering leeches&#39; 
and Soi smiling, doing her best to go back into the role of content 
daughter. She didn&#39;t have the heart to bring up what had happened, not 
because she was necessarily ashamed of it but because she herself still 
didn&#39;t know what to think about the whole event. Every night Soi thought 
she&#39;d gotten over it, but she&#39;d wake up the next morning to find her 
pillow just slightly damp. Having her father back, well and in good 
spirits, was enough of a blessing that she didn&#39;t want to waste it with 
him worrying about her.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s good to be back,&quot; Zhou declared as he walked back into the 
house, hobbling slightly on a cane for support until the remaining brace 
on his leg was ready to come off. He stood in the small entryway for 
about a minute until his stomach gurgled so loud that the girl behind 
him smiled in spite of herself. &quot;Uh... I guess I should get started on 
dinner, huh?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Dad,&quot; Soi assured him with a grin. &quot;...You sit down-- I&#39;ll 
call the pizza place.&quot;

----------

With dinner finished and the unfinished half of the vegetarian pizza 
sitting wrapped in the fridge (Zhou, despite his inclination toward 
sausage, had relented when Soi reminded him that a heart attack at this 
point in time would only mean another trip to the hospital), Soi stood 
over the sink, running a warm rag over a particularly stubborn clump of 
dried cheese and tomato sauce that had stuck to her dinner plate. She&#39;d 
been doing it for so long now that it was beginning to become a 
subconscious act, her mind wandering elsewhere while her hands continued 
to work at the same steady pace. She tried her best not to think about 
Yoruichi. But her plate was yellow, so much so like those golden eyes 
that she&#39;d adored so silently that she felt herself drifting off 
completely...

&quot;Little Bee? Everything all right?&quot;

Her father. She snapped out of it almost instantly, almost like a 
musician waiting for her cue to rejoin the orchestra, smiling as she did 
so.

&quot;Hey, Dad. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m just finishing up, okay?&quot; He nodded, but 
instead of leaving walked up a little ways behind her, and almost 
instinctively Soi knew that he had something on his mind. She continued 
scrubbing as he spoke, doing her best to act like she wasn&#39;t worried.

&quot;...So... your friend told me that you stayed at her house while I 
was... you know, &#39;incapacitated.&#39;&quot; He said the last bit with the ghost 
of a chuckle in his voice but it made Soi&#39;s blood run cold; the way he 
said it made him sound almost suspicious.

&quot;Y-yeah. At Yoruichi&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Did you have fun?&quot; Soi recalled the way she&#39;d had to run back to 
Yoruichi&#39;s house to grab her things after seeing her with Kisuke, 
thankful even as she had fought back tears that the senior never 
bothered to lock her front door.

&quot;...Uh-huh. We watched some movies during the weekend...&quot;

&quot;Soi-chan...&quot; the patriarch said quietly, not moving from his position 
while he watched her hands tremble slightly, though why he wasn&#39;t sure. 
&quot;...You never told me about why you were so happy the other day.&quot;

Though she knew it only made her situation look worse Soi remained 
silent, unsure of what to say.

&quot;Do you like her?&quot;

&quot;Well, of course I do,&quot; Soi answered, her mind running nearly as fast as 
her mouth as she tried to think of what her father would do-- if he 
would do anything. &quot;S-she&#39;s my best friend, and she&#39;s a really popular 
person and I--&quot; The girl tried to continue, but the words got stuck in 
her throat, memories crushed at her heart to the point she thought she 
would collapse right there if she wasn&#39;t already doubled over on the 
sink, a hand covering her eyes in an effort to keep herself under 
control. She tried to continue but her father put his free hand on her 
trembling shoulder, squeezing it gently.

&quot;H-how...d-did you...?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Zhou whispered, more to himself than to her, &quot;...I didn&#39;t know 
for sure, but... I guess you could say I had a hunch. To be honest... I 
didn&#39;t want to believe it at first-- that you were... well, like that.&quot;

The freshman&#39;s shoulders shook harder, vain attempts to keep herself 
under control showing. This was it-- he was ashamed of her, he HAD to 
be. But the reassuring hand on her arm didn&#39;t go away.

&quot;But,&quot; Zhou continued after he&#39;d taken a deep breath, &quot;...you ARE my 
little girl, and... to be honest, I just want you to be happy. Even if I 
can&#39;t pretend that I understand completely.&quot; She knew that his words 
were what she&#39;d always needed to hear, but they&#39;d come too late and now 
they only made Soi more miserable. All this time everyone had known-- 
and only when Yoruichi had abandoned her did she now have the support of 
the most important person in her life. She felt stupid, like everyone 
had been in on a joke that she&#39;d just now figured out she was the 
punchline of. Soi would have just stood helplessly over the sink if Zhou 
hadn&#39;t moved forward slightly, cradling his daughter&#39;s bitterly sobbing 
face into his shoulder. Even though she hadn&#39;t so much as shed a tear 
since his wife had died, he still could do this for her, if nothing 
else.

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Soi managed even as her voice cracked, &quot;...I don&#39;t know. I-I just 
th-thought that she really... Oh God, I was so s-stupid...&quot;

&quot;Soi-chan, I know you&#39;re hurting right now. But it&#39;s not your fault. And 
as for her...there&#39;ll be someone else, you&#39;ll see.&quot; Soi shook her head, 
still weeping as she clung to her father a little tighter.

&quot;N-no...I-I-I wanted t--&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Zhou assured her quietly, &quot;...that it feels like she was the 
only person in the world, that your heart&#39;s so broken it won&#39;t fit back 
together. I know EXACTLY how you feel.&quot; The freshman blinked, felt her 
tears slow as she knew instantly who he was talking about, the feeling 
that the world was crashing down around her growing a bit silly as she 
thought about it. &quot;...But you&#39;ll find someone better. I&#39;m an old man, 
there aren&#39;t any more chances for me. But each day it&#39;ll hurt a little 
bit less, and you&#39;ll be able to look her in the eye and know she doesn&#39;t 
have that sort of control over you anymore. It&#39;ll get better. I 
promise.&quot;

The Fong girl didn&#39;t know how much of that she&#39;d believed, if she ever 
had any real hope of getting over something so deeply rooted in her 
heart. But standing here with her father, letting herself cry out 
everything she felt confused and angry and hurt over, did make her feel 
a little better.</pre>
