The weather had gotten warmer over the past few days, and with it the 
restlessness that accompanies high school students so painfully close to 
graduation that each minute in class seems to drag twice as long as it 
normally does. And for Yoruichi, it also meant that her departure from 
Japan was inching steadily nearer. Kuukaku was still angry and refused 
to speak to her face, but Kisuke told Yoruichi after the Shiba girl had 
pulled him aside that she shouldn&#39;t expect too big a going away gift 
from her. Yoruichi had only shrugged, muttering that she didn&#39;t care 
either way as she gave a yawn, fighting to keep her eyelids from 
shutting on her and lulling her to sleep.

Her reluctance of late to go to sleep had begun taking its toll already, 
spurred on by an incessant flood of images of Soi Fong, which never 
seemed to leave her alone unless she lacked the energy to even feign 
coherence. Thus she&#39;d begun running into the early hours of morning, but 
not like the controlled, graceful sort she employed normally. It was 
inefficient, forced movement, just trying to get as far as she could, 
but inevitably ending up in circles, and even then Soi wouldn&#39;t go away 
completely; it served the purpose of numbing her more than anything 
else. She&#39;d been excited before about her impending overseas trip, but 
now all she wanted was for it to get here and take her as far away from 
this place as it could, away from her memories that tortured her without 
cease.

----------

&quot;Hey,&quot; Kisuke pondered aloud, jarring Yoruichi from her meditative task 
of playing with the straw in her juice container. &quot;I was wondering when 
you wanted to have a party-- you know, for your trip.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kisuke flinched at the dark-skinned girl&#39;s rather immediate 
answer. &quot;...I don&#39;t want to.&quot;

&quot;B-but it&#39;s not like you to miss a chance t--&quot;

&quot;I said I don&#39;t want to!&quot; Yoruichi paused once she realized how harshly 
she&#39;d spoken, almost like a tempramental child. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry-- I&#39;ve 
just been tired lately.&quot;

&quot;So I gather,&quot; the blonde muttered under his breath. The early spring 
wind washed over the roof occasionally to balance the warmth of the sun, 
but to Kisuke it only felt cold, reminded him of how distant from 
Yoruichi he really was. The next thing he said was innocuous enough, 
even though he himself knew what it would lead to. &quot;...You&#39;re coming 
over tonight, right? We were gonna try getting through that movie 
again...&quot;

&quot;...Oh. Yeah, of course,&quot; Yoruichi answered listlessly, even thought 
she&#39;d forgotten altogether.

&quot;All right. It&#39;s a date, then.&quot; She hoped Kisuke hadn&#39;t seen her freeze 
at his usage of the term, stare numbly off into the distance as the 
phrase sank in. She hadn&#39;t wanted to refer to her get-togethers with 
Urahara like this, but she supposed that was what they were doing-- 
dating. Exactly like a boy and girl their age should have been doing, 
with exactly the proper sort of person. After all, she wasn&#39;t as though 
she was with anyone else. She hated herself for feeling that way, but 
the very thought made her sick to her stomach.

----------

The TV provided the only light in the room as it flickered like a 
lantern, casting technicolor shapes onto the forms of the two sitting 
before it. Yoruichi knew that it felt all too familiar, lounging on the 
same couch with Soi after they&#39;d...

Stop, she reminded herself. Don&#39;t think about her-- even though it felt 
impossible at the moment. Kisuke glanced at Yoruichi, aware by her 
restlessness of what was on her mind. He gave a sigh as he stopped 
pretending to be interested in the images before him, taking a deep 
breath as he prepared to move forward. He hated himself for doing 
something like this-- especially when he knew that Yoruichi&#39;s heart was 
somewhere else-- but she was too proud to admit her own mistakes. He had 
to force her to see what she&#39;d done, make her do something that would be 
impossible to dismiss or take back. He felt her flinch as he slid a hand 
along the couch and around her shoulders, pulling her close.

The first thing Yoruichi felt as Kisuke&#39;s arm cradled her was the sudden 
impulse to pull away, but before she took action she stopped herself 
short. It would look strange to her... boyfriend... to react negatively 
to his touch, so she swallowed her unease despite the fact that her 
stomach was churning. She hoped that he wouldn&#39;t notice her lack of 
enthusiasm.

&quot;Yoruichi...&quot; He whispered, almost forgetting himself at actually 
holding her this way, the want in his voice helping to make his 
intentions clear. But Yoruichi felt no thrill, no breathlessness at his 
tone. She simply did her best to mirror the look in his eyes as he moved 
forward, a bit faster than she&#39;d expected, firmly planting his lips on 
hers. She felt her mind go blank, but not the way it had with Soi-- 
where it had felt welcoming, peaceful.

No matter how much she wanted to she couldn&#39;t force herself to react the 
way she knew she should; Yoruichi knew he was a good-looking man, that 
any girl would kill to be in her shoes now. He was strong and patient 
and effortlessly charming. Everything a woman could ask for. And yet she 
couldn&#39;t help feeling violated as he touched her, a rough hand sliding 
down her skin as if to force a reaction, couldn&#39;t help wishing that 
another pair of hands were there instead. But this was what she&#39;d 
chosen, to push Soi away. She had to live with it, and the thought of a 
lifetime ahead of herself feeling this miserable only made her stomach 
protest more.

Kisuke slid his lips along Yoruichi&#39;s neck, ignoring her growing signs 
of unrest, of discomfort. At the moment all he felt was anger, at her 
for never looking at him the way he&#39;d wanted her to, for not ONCE making 
an effort to see him as more than a friend. He wanted to hurt her, 
wanted to force this on her, wanted to believe that by doing this there 
was the slightest chance that she could grow to love him.

The young woman cringed as fingers ran along her back, lips on her 
throat.

Just accept it, she tried to assure herself, but it felt hollow, 
meaningless. This wasn&#39;t right. Not what she really wanted at all. Stop, 
she thought desperately. Stop stop stop stop stop--

&quot;Stop.&quot;

At the sound of her own voice-- issued unbeknownst to Yoruichi-- she 
opened her eyes to find that her hands were outstretched, forcing Kisuke 
at arm&#39;s length. Her shirt was bunched up beneath her breasts, the 
outline of her bra barely visible; the blonde seemed to fall out of a 
trance at her sudden whispered command, and the hands that had been busy 
tracing the outline of her body came to an unceremonious rest beside 
him. Yoruichi&#39;s mind raced, the weight of her action coming to force 
itself fully on her mind. Slowly her hands came back to her, as though 
she could take back what she&#39;d done with the simple action; she was 
rapidly searching for words, for some way to allay what she took to be 
Kisuke&#39;s confusion.

&quot;...I-I&#39;m... I... I can&#39;t.&quot; The silence that followed was one of the 
harshest and most tormenting Yoruichi had ever endured. She wanted 
Kisuke to say something, anything that would allow her to keep up the 
illusion. But by now his frustration had subsided, replaced by a 
somewhat tentative measure of serenity. &quot;...I&#39;m just...&quot;

&quot;...Tired? Is that what you were going to tell me this time?&quot; Though his 
voice sounded just a bit hurt, the tone of joviality and understanding 
he seemed to bear whenever he could tell she was lying was there. It 
eased Yoruichi slightly, but the overall air of apprehension hadn&#39;t died 
down, leaving her feeling like a cornered animal. She couldn&#39;t help 
wondering if he knew, or how long he had known if he DID, in fact. 
Urahara sighed, then ran fingers through his long hair, scratching the 
top to give his nervous right hand something to do. No matter how much 
he knew this had to take place, he still had been dreading this moment, 
this talk with his best friend in the world. &quot;...What&#39;s really wrong 
with you, Yoruichi?&quot; After another long pause, he decided to stop 
dancing around the issue, especially since Yoruichi didn&#39;t seem any more 
eager to bring it up.

&quot;...Are you going to tell me it&#39;s about Soi Fong, or are you just going 
to sit there and jerk me around some more?&quot; Yoruichi flinched visibly at 
his casual statement, instantly realizing that to lie further would only 
sink her deeper. But it came out anyway, automatically.

&quot;Nothing&#39;s going on.&quot; She looked him in the eye, hoping that he would 
believe her, but his gaze simply pierced her attempts at deceit. &quot;Well, 
I--...&quot; Yoruichi tried to hold his stare but it overwhelmed her, leaving 
her feeling self-conscious, naked in a crowd of people. Before she knew 
what she was doing it was coming out faster than she could think, faster 
than she could stop it. &quot;Kisuke, I&#39;m sorry, but... But I had to do it.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I... I h-had to protect her. S-she shouldn&#39;t have been around 
me and I shouldn&#39;t have let it happen, but it did and... and I HAD to 
keep her away from me!&quot; She sounded desperate, like she was trying to 
convince even herself that it was the truth. &quot;I...was just t-trying to 
protect her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bullshit me Yoruichi,&quot; Urahara whispered solemnly, more than a 
little bitterly. &quot;You were protecting YOURSELF.&quot;

Yoruichi felt the words sting, bite into her heart knowing they were 
true, but still she couldn&#39;t face it, didn&#39;t want to hear it.

&quot;T-That&#39;s ridiculous-- I don&#39;t have any reason to...&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi...&quot; the blonde whispered, more than a little exasperated, 
&quot;...You&#39;re my best friend. I know you better than... well... almost 
anyone,&quot; he admitted as he shrugged his shoulders. &quot;And not once in the 
entire time I&#39;ve known you have you ever had anything close to a 
relationship. Don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; Kisuke corrected himself, &quot;...of 
course you had your boyfriends and girlfriends and all those people you 
dragged around... but you never once felt anything for any of them. But 
her...&quot; he paused, and Yoruichi instantly knew he meant Soi, &quot;... you 
didn&#39;t treat her like the rest. I&#39;ve never, EVER seen you so happy 
around anyone as you were with her.&quot;

The young woman blinked, stared at her friend. Had she really been so... 
obvious? It didn&#39;t seem right. But then, Soi WAS different. Special, she 
admitted to herself, feeling that strange tug in her chest as she 
connected the word to the freshman.

&quot;You were afraid she&#39;d leave you. So... you left her.&quot; Yoruichi opened 
her mouth to protest again, to say that it was the farthest possible 
thing from the truth, but as she thought about it she realized that he 
was right. She was so used to being strong, to being dominant, to 
controlling and manipulating the feelings of others that meeting a girl 
like Soi-- who was so guileless but so independent-- had felt strange. 
She knew Soi was strong, and her encounter with the freshman on the 
stairs had meant that she COULD get along without her. She didn&#39;t want 
her to be like that-- she had really wanted to see Soi in tears, begging 
for her back into her life, so that she could continue to get what she 
wanted without having to make an emotional investment of her own. She 
had never really WANTED Soi to get over her. So what did she want from 
the girl? As she acknowledged these facts another truth welled up inside 
her, aching to be accepted, but Yoruichi still put up a desperate fight 
with it. Instead, Kisuke spoke it aloud.

&quot;...You love her, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;N-no. I used her, that&#39;s all. I...&quot; Yoruichi tried to continue but her 
heart told her it was a lie, that it was impossible to have simply USED 
Soi because she hadn&#39;t felt nothing, like she always had. She wondered 
what she was trying to say as Kisuke&#39;s words echoed in her head.

&quot;I just...&quot;

But there was Soi, long before she&#39;d really known her, refusing her hand 
as she pulled herself off the ground, wiping a hand over her bloody 
nose, the late afternoon sun casting a haze of orange over her uniform.

An embarassed Soi taking back the lunch she&#39;d had stolen from her, which 
Yoruichi herself had stuck her neck out to get back.

Soi ignoring her, uncomfortable as Yoruichi invited herself inside, 
visibly outside her carefully constructed confort zone.

Soi struggling to capture the precision of a new kata, then doing it 
again with an almost surprising degree of grace and patience.

Soi being led away by Isane into the twinkling lights of the festival, 
triggering the first pang of real jealousy Yoruichi had ever felt.

Her hesitant smiles, so rare that she went out of her way to encourage 
them, to see that blank expression light up with joy that felt all too 
contagious.

Soi&#39;s hand in her hair as she tried to fall asleep, the only thing she 
was aware of beyond her haze of medicine and illness.

Her lips, so startlingly warm and chapped and rough in the chill winter 
air that she hadn&#39;t known what to do, what to say. No-- she HAD known 
what she wanted, how much she had just wanted to hold her back and kiss 
her, how gladly she would have stayed in the snow all night if it meant 
Soi wouldn&#39;t stop, but had been too...well, afraid... to do anything. 
And accompanying each of these memories, so brief but held so deeply in 
her heart despite her denial, was the feeling again, this time growing 
too strong, too powerful to ignore.

&quot;I...&quot; the freshman slipped into her thoughts again, and as she held her 
there every emotion that had been in her way seemed to evaporate in the 
gentle gaze of her eyes. Except for one, and it hit Yoruichi like a ton 
of bricks.

I really do...

&quot;Oh, God...&quot; Yoruichi whispered, a hand finding its way to cover her 
mouth, as though afraid to say such a foreign set of words aloud. But it 
was too late to fight, had been too late for so much longer than she&#39;d 
let herself see. Soi was swimming in her blood now, as much a part of 
herself as breathing, and she felt her heart ache as she did so; Soi&#39;s 
absence tearing at something deep within the upperclassman. Kisuke made 
to put a reassuring hand on her shoulder but hesitated, thought better 
of the gesture as he saw the visibly crushed, vulnerable look on 
Yoruichi&#39;s face, her heart broken before she&#39;d let herself realize how 
far she&#39;d fallen.

&quot;There&#39;s still time, you know.&quot; To her surprise Yoruichi chuckled 
bitterly at him, as if he&#39;d been taunting her on purpose.

&quot;Kisuke... I can&#39;t.&quot; She didn&#39;t deserve it, that happiness Soi had given 
her so freely, the love that she&#39;d poured her whole body and soul into, 
offering it without any hesitation. Yoruichi didn&#39;t know how to do that, 
to suddenly be a girlfriend to someone, to love her the way she deserved 
to be. &quot;...She should have someone better.&quot;

&quot;Who do you think you&#39;re trying to kid? The Yoruichi I know wouldn&#39;t 
just give up like that.&quot; The girl was silent, chin resting morosely on 
her knees as she stared at the now-blank television screen. &quot;You need 
her, Yoruichi. Don&#39;t let her go. You have to show her... how much she 
matters to you.&quot; Yoruichi sighed, took a moment before she spoke again, 
this time her voice small and quiet; afraid to ask what had been on her 
mind all along.

&quot;What if... she says no?&quot;

&quot;...If you really love her, you&#39;ll trust her. And if she feels even half 
of what you do... she&#39;ll find a way to forgive you.&quot; Kisuke got off the 
couch, feeling rather ashamed of himself as he headed toward the front 
door.

&quot;Kisuke.&quot; He paused but didn&#39;t turn at Yoruichi&#39;s sudden exclamation. He 
simply waited for her to speak.

&quot;I...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

She bit her lip, hoping for him to turn and tell her it was all right, 
but he only gave what looked like a nod before opening the door and 
walking out, shutting it behind him. Yoruichi threw her head back, 
sighed bitterly at the ceiling as she was left alone with her feelings, 
so long held back. It hurt to think about her friend now, but he was 
right.

She DID love Soi. But what scared her the most was that she might be 
more in love with Soi than Soi was with her.</pre>
