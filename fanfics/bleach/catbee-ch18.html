While it couldn&#39;t be argued that Gin Ichimaru was a cold bastard, he did 
at least seem to be a man of his word. He didn&#39;t make any attempt to 
bother Soi for the rest of the day-- in fact, it seemed like he was 
going out of his way to ignore her, becoming deaf when she casually 
requested that he pass the salt at lunch or refusing to acknowledge her 
presence when she walked into a room. Soi didn&#39;t mind this treatment at 
all, but Yoruichi was far from satisfied with the bully&#39;s additude and 
voiced it privately to her friend on occasion.

&quot;...Seriously, if you want me to beat him up, I can make it happen REAL 
easy,&quot; the Black-belt said through the side of her mouth after Gin had 
bumped into Soi, acting like she wasn&#39;t there.

&quot;Come on, Yoruichi-san,&quot; Soi rresponded with a bit of exasperation. 
&quot;...It&#39;s no big deal. And besides, I&#39;ll take that over being beaten up 
any day.&quot; Yoruichi wanted to contend that after how Ichimaru had treated 
her he could at least have the decency to be civil, but the likelihood 
of that occuring coupled with Soi&#39;s disinterested contentment finally 
made the older girl drop the issue.

&quot;Hey, why are you guys so glum?&quot; Rangiku asked from atop the stairs, 
where she had just finished brushing her teeth. &quot;Come on-- we&#39;re going 
swimming today!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Soi asked uncomfortably. &quot;I thought that it was supposed to be 
rainy today...&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;d you hear that?&quot; the blonde wondered in disbelief. &quot;No 
way--nothin&#39; but blue skies and clear seas &#39;til Saturday!&quot;

&quot;G-great,&quot; Soi answered with as much false enthusiasm as she could 
muster while Matsumoto headed to her room to change. Soi was about to 
head down the hallway when Yoruichi stopped her.

&quot;...Somethin&#39; wrong?&quot;

&quot;N-no...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Yoruichi asked skeptically. &quot;...You didn&#39;t seem too enthused 
about swimming...You DO know that&#39;s the main reason we came, right?&quot; Soi 
had figured as much, but she was so excited by both the idea of spending 
time with Yoruichi and of coming to the ocean (which she hadn&#39;t seen 
since she was a little girl) that she&#39;d forgotten the most important 
thing.

&quot;I...I forgot to...bring a swimsuit,&quot; Soi muttered as she stared at the 
floor. Yoruichi nodded in understanding, then was silent for a moment as 
she considered the options.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re not...ahem...big enough (Soi wondered if she was burning 
up enough to melt straight through the ground) to wear one of mine... 
Hey, I know! I&#39;ll drive you into town and you can choose one for 
yourself!&quot; Soi&#39;s eyes widened to the size of serving trays. Alone? With 
Yoruichi? Looking at...

Goddamnit, Soi! the girl ordered herself angrily. Get your mind out of 
the gutter!

&quot;Hey, what is it?&quot; Yoruichi queried as she leaned down and caught a 
glimpse of Soi&#39;s look of mixed desire and confusion.

&quot;N-n-nothing,&quot; Soi fibbed, trying to avoid Yoruichi&#39;s gaze as she stood 
rooted to the spot. &quot;You...you don&#39;t have to do t-that, 
Yoruichi-san...I&#39;ll just, um...just read on the beach.&quot; The older woman 
didn&#39;t respond at first, but Soi did notice the look of disappointment 
on her features.

&quot;...Are you sure? You&#39;re really okay with doing THAT?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; Soi said as she threw on a smile and walked past her friend.

&quot;Okay, if that&#39;s what makes you happy...&quot; Yoruichi shrugged as she 
headed off to change.

As the freshman sat on the beach towel, wearing an oversized plain-white 
T-shirt over her underwear, she couldn&#39;t help but regret her decision.

...Why the hell did I say &#39;no?&#39;

No matter how many times she tried to ask herself that question, she 
could never offer herself a straight answer. It was strange that she 
wanted to be around Yoruichi, but lately the comfortable vibe she&#39;d had 
before was being replaced by an unnerving sense of tension. Yoruichi had 
only wanted to take her to the store, for God&#39;s sake, but she&#39;d balked 
for no reason! Soi heaved a sigh as she put her book down briefly, then 
gazed at the nearby shoreline.

Nanao was in a plain, dark-green one-piece, more than able to swim but 
opting to follow in Soi&#39;s footsteps by reading a complicated-looking 
text instead. Rukia and Renji had arrived an hour after breakfast, and 
were busy building an elaborate sandcastle at the water&#39;s edge (Soi 
actually laughed at the sight-- it seemed that Rukia was more interested 
in the innocent pursuit of sand architecture while her other half seemed 
more focused on finding a shady spot that wouldn&#39;t be looked in on too 
quickly). Finally, Soi&#39;s eyes drifted a little further out to sea to 
find Yoruichi and Kuukaku single-handedly challenging Kisuke, Shunsui 
and Ukitake to water-wrestling, a contest that the two were easily 
winning on their own. The freshman smiled to herself as she watched her 
sempai yank Urahara into the surf, grinning victoriously all the while. 
That was her Yoruichi-san-- such a strong, vibrant, exuberant, 
gorgeous...

Soi blinked furiously at her last thought, her face going red even as 
she tried to assure herself that her idle thought hadn&#39;t meant anything. 
Of course she thought Yoruichi was beautiful--she&#39;d have to be blind not 
to notice that! But she only thought that as a girl admiring another 
girl--that was all.

...But then, Soi thought as her eyes drifted back to a very scantily 
clad Yoruichi, her smile almost hypnotically radiant even in her 
decidely unfeminine activity, ...why can&#39;t I stop looking at her?

&quot;...Hey, what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;AAH!&quot; Soi yelped as a quiet voice suddenly brought her back to the 
present, tossing her book into the air in the process. She turned and 
was about to yell when she noticed the short-haired girl standing a few 
feet behind her, clothed in a long tank-top style bikini that seemed 
more like a bodysuit compared to the held-together-by-threads look of 
the lounging Rangiku&#39;s outfit.

&quot;S-sorry,&quot; Isane apologized with a little bow that reminded Soi of 
herself a bit. &quot;...I...I just saw you sitting alone, a-and I wondered 
if...if you wanted some c-company. Oh, here--I&#39;ll go get your book...&quot; 
Soi went from startled to very confused within the course of a few 
seconds. This girl didn&#39;t seem to fit her image of a Junior at all-- she 
was stuttering slightly, had the faintest traces of a blush on her lean 
face. It almost seemed like she was nervous about talking to Soi, but 
for the life of her the Chinese girl couldn&#39;t understand why. Isane 
picked the tome up and was about to hand it back to Soi when she lifted 
the cover to her face.

&quot;...What is it?&quot; Soi asked casually, as she wasn&#39;t really interested in 
what the other girl had to say.

&quot;Oh, n-nothing,&quot; Isane said with a shrug as he returned the book to its 
owner. &quot;I just...well, I&#39;ve read that book, too. Well, &#39;bye,&quot; the girl 
said quickly as she cursed herself for getting so flustered-- why did 
she always have to get that way around people she was...interested in?

&quot;Wait!&quot; Soi called and Isane turned to see the freshman&#39;s eyes narrow 
slightly in intrigue. She wasn&#39;t really doing anything important, so 
what could it hurt to engage in a litte friendly conversation? &quot;...Did 
you like it? The book, I mean.&quot; Isane lit up just a little bit at the 
slight drop in Soi&#39;s autonomous personality.

&quot;Oh, y-yeah! It&#39;s one of my favorites! I&#39;ve actually read it...&quot; at this 
the girl began to tap on her fingers in succession from pinky to thumb, 
&quot;...about 8 times.&quot;

&quot;Really? So have I!&quot; Soi said enthusiastically, happy in spite of 
herself that someone else here had common interests with her. &quot;Well, 
actually I&#39;ve read all the books in the series about 3 times each, but I 
can&#39;t put this one down, no matter how many times I read it!&quot;

&quot;I know! I love this guy&#39;s writing...&quot; Isane began as a Yoruichi made 
her way up to the two girls.

&quot;Hey, Soi!&quot;

&quot;Oh, H--...Hi, Yoruichi-san...&quot; Soi said as her cheerful greeting turned 
into an embarrassed mumble. She&#39;d nearly forgotten that Yoruichi was 
here in her getting acquainted with Isane, but seeing the older girl 
with her dark, elegant hair matted around her face and shoulders (not to 
mention the way her skin shimmered slightly from the seawater&#39;s moisture 
that remained on her) made her presence all but indelible from Soi&#39;s 
mind. Yoruichi smiled at Isane as well, but the Junior didn&#39;t catch the 
less-than-sincere undercurrent to her grin.

&quot;...What are you doing, Kotetsu?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, I was just, uh...talking to Soi Fong.&quot; Isane said as though 
she had nothing to hide. Yoruichi gave the girl an almost accusatory 
look before turning back to her friend.

&quot;So, are you SURE you don&#39;t wanna come in? The water&#39;s great!&quot;

&quot;P-p-pretty sure,&quot; Soi answered as she forced herself to look away, only 
to find that the image of Yoruichi in her bikini was now burned into her 
brain.

&quot;...All right,&quot; Yoruichi said as she ran back, waving at a Kuukaku 
impatient to beat the boys again.

Stupid, Soi thought as she watched the older woman go, not even making 
an attempt to listen as Isane began talking about the book again.

Soi Fong waved goodbye to Isane as she headed up toward the house, 
nodding incoherently as the other girl mentioned through a blush that 
she&#39;d like to visit with her again tomorrow. The freshman wasn&#39;t sure 
how the hours had drifted away so quickly, but it was nearly dusk now 
and everyone was heading up the dune, torn between tired exhileration or 
hunger. Soi assured an intrigued Rangiku that she&#39;d follow after them in 
a minute, then headed down to the shore. Yoruichi was still there, 
swimming against the cresting waves only to let them move her back 
towards the sand, breathing in the taste of the sea air, savoring the 
way the water washed over her skin. The upperclassman opened her eyes 
upon hearing the gentle pitter-patter of bare feet on sand, but instead 
of feeling intruded upon, she was actually rather glad.

&quot;...So...&quot; she asked with a teasing smile once Soi was within earshot, 
pulling herself into a sitting position with her legs still under the 
surface of the water, &quot;...What did Isane want?&quot;

&quot;...Huh?&quot; Soi asked, surprised by the question. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Nothin&#39;,&quot; the older girl answered without looking at her friend. 
&quot;...Just looked like she was getting a little &#39;friendly&#39; is all...&quot; 
Soi&#39;s eyebrow furrowed a little bit at the odd accusation.

&quot;...I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; the freshman answered after 
a moment. &quot;...We were just talking. I really don&#39;t know her at all, 
though.&quot; After a moment, Yoruichi turned around, her smile firmly in 
place, making any apprehension Soi may have had dissipate.

&quot;Well, what did you want, Soi?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Soi began uncertainly, as she didn&#39;t have much experience in 
asking for things. She didn&#39;t like the idea of owing Yoruichi more than 
she did, but if it meant she could be around her more... &quot;I 
was...wondering if y-you could take me to...to get a swimsuit?&quot; She was 
almost afraid Yoruichi would refuse, at least until she saw her friend&#39;s 
face light up.

&quot;Well, now you&#39;re talkin&#39; some sense!&quot; Yoruichi said as she stood up, 
wading toward the petite girl calmly. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll see if I can get the 
car from Kisuke and we&#39;ll go tomorrow, okay?&quot;

&quot;O-okay!&quot; Soi said enthusiasically, not regretting in the slightest now 
that she had come to Yoruichi and asked-- at least, not until the tall 
girl picked her up in one swift motion and tossed her into the water.

&quot;W...(koff)...what was that for!&quot; Soi called in surprised horror as she 
pulled herself back to shore, shivering over Yoruichi&#39;s ecstatic 
chuckling. &quot;G-god, i-i-it&#39;s c-c-cold!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Yoruichi forced herself to speak as she wiped away a 
mirth-induced tear. &quot;...I didn&#39;t do anything...&quot;

&quot;Y-y-you&#39;re m-m-mean!&quot; Soi said as grumpily as she could, which wasn&#39;t 
much considering that she was shivering now to stop herself from 
breaking out into shared laughter.

&quot;What? You look cute wet,&quot; the older girl teased as she indicated the 
now-transparent shirt clinging to Soi&#39;s body, and she gasped once she 
looked down to find her underwear visible, which only made Yoruichi 
double over with renewed giggling.

&quot;S-shut up,&quot; Soi mumbled even as she began to laugh as well, trying to 
calm down enough to wrap herself in Yoruichi&#39;s nearby towel. It took 
them both a few minutes for their breathing to return to normal, at 
which point Yoruichi threw an arm around Soi&#39;s neck and pulled her up 
the beach with her.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get back-- they&#39;ll think something&#39;s up.&quot; Soi caught the 
teasing smile and the wink in Yoruichi&#39;s eye, but she didn&#39;t have the 
slightest idea what the dark-skinned girl was implying. For her part, 
she was just glad she was alone with Yoruichi, even if she still didn&#39;t 
understand what the warmth inside her at her sempai&#39;s presence meant.</pre>
