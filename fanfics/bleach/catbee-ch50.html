&quot;Yoruichi! Yoruichi, are you even awake?!&quot;

&quot;Hnnnnm... jus... five more minutes...&quot; the senior muttered incoherently 
as she wrapped the sheets even tighter about herself, shifting to her 
side on the couch. Soi groaned, rolling her eyes as she pushed harder 
against the dark-skinned girl&#39;s shoulder, barely sparking a reaction 
from the slumbering beauty.

Jeez... you STILL sleep like a rock,&quot; the Chinese girl quipped as she 
tore the sheets away in a single movement. &quot;Yoruichi, come ON! We have 
to get to school!

&quot;Wh...why?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re already late, and if you don&#39;t get there soon you won&#39;t 
be able to graduate!&quot;

She&#39;d never seen anyone snap to awareness that quickly, Soi considered 
minutes later as Yoruichi put on her clothes and rushed out the door, 
followed seconds later by a slightly-better-prepared freshman.

----------

&quot;What about your uniform? You can&#39;t go in there...like that!&quot; Soi 
managed as she ran, already finding it difficult to keep in step with 
Yoruichi&#39;s longer and more controlled strides.

&quot;N-no time! If they don&#39;t like it... well, too bad!&quot; Yoruichi called 
back as she slowed her pace just enough to let the younger girl catch up 
with her. They ran in silence for a few minutes before the upperclassman 
spoke, the strain of extended running finally beginning to make itself 
clear. &quot;H...hey...about...our talk...now that...you&#39;ve thought things 
over...are you s-sure?&quot;

Soi tried to huff a response, but instead ended up clutching the stitch 
in her chest to indicate that she was in no condition to answer.

----------

&quot;Shit,&quot; Yoruichi whispered as the pair walked finally reached Rukongai, 
only to find the first floor deserted. &quot;...How late am I?&quot;

&quot;There might...still...be...time...for you to get to your class,&quot; the 
freshman managed as she leaned against a nearby locker, gasping 
desperately. Soi made to head for her floor but Yoruichi grabbed her arm 
in midstride, pulling the girl&#39;s eyes to her own.

&quot;Just so you know...I&#39;m blaming your Dad for not letting us share the 
bed.&quot;

&quot;If Dad...hadn&#39;t caught you molesting me he might have let us,&quot; Soi 
retorted with as sardonic a smile as she could manage. &quot;...I&#39;ll see you 
in the gym, okay?&quot; Despite their obvious lack of time Yoruichi 
hesitated, holding Soi&#39;s arm a little less urgently.

&quot;...Okay,&quot; she finally muttered as she headed in the opposite direction, 
toward the already packed auditorium. When she came through the doors 
she felt everyone&#39;s eyes turn onto her, and though a sudden fear gripped 
Yoruichi it faded just as quickly when she realized that the ceremony 
had yet to begin. Walking as quickly as she could without being too much 
of a distraction, she quickly found her class and slipped into the 
nearest open seat by the aisle, not noticing who she was seated besides 
until an all-too-familiar voice hit her.

&quot;You&#39;re late.&quot;

Registering her long-time friend instantly, Yoruichi turned around 
slowly, as if expecting him to be angry with her. Instead, the blonde 
had the slightest hint of a smile on his face, his emerald eyes calm and 
almost playfully condescending.

&quot;Kisuke!&quot; For a moment she just stared at him, unsure of what to say 
after so long without speaking to the teen. Biting her lip slightly, she 
opened her mouth, making sure not to cause any more attention to herself 
than she already had. &quot;...I...&quot;

&quot;Here. I didn&#39;t see you at the house this weekend, so I figured...&quot; She 
stopped short as he handed her the parcel she hadn&#39;t noticed was on his 
lap, gasping when she opened it to find a neatly folded uniform inside. 
&quot;We can talk later. But for now, you&#39;d better get dressed.&quot;

Even after all this, all that she&#39;d done-- still the same old Kisuke. 
Yoruichi wanted to hug him, but decided instead to slip out to the 
bathroom while there was still time.

----------

Soi looked around as her class proceeded into the gym, her heart giving 
a jump in her chest as she caught sight of Yoruichi, relieved that she&#39;d 
somehow managed to get her clothing issue taken care of. At the same 
time, it occured to her that she&#39;d never see the senior in that outfit 
again, after only one short year. The whole space of time felt like an 
illusion, impossible for so much to have changed-- for both of them-- in 
only 12 months.

&quot;Fong-chan,&quot; the boy behind her muttered suddenly, &quot;You&#39;re holding up 
the line.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; Soi grimaced as she realized that she&#39;d been staring at 
her...girlfriend, she supposed. &quot;Sorry!&quot; Quickly taking her seat near 
the front of the auditorium, the Chinese girl glanced back, towards 
Yoruichi, contemplating what she&#39;d discussed with the senior.

Before her train of thought could wander too far, Principal Yamamoto 
stepped up to the stage, and once everyone had respectfully stood and 
bowed to the patriarch the graduation finally began.

&quot;Yoruichi?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; the older girl mumbled through a mouthful of corn flakes, making 
Soi supress a chuckle despite her somber tone. &quot;Whad&#39;s wrong? You loog 
ubsed...&quot;

&quot;I was thinking about what you said...you know, last night?&quot; At this 
Yoruichi swallowed, then washed it down with a quick gulp of milk.

&quot;...Yeah...what about it? I know it&#39;s kind of a shock, but I realized 
that I--&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi, listen... I think,&quot; Soi said, pausing to take a steadying 
breath, &quot;...I think that you SHOULD go.&quot;

----------

&quot;And now,&quot; Yamamoto said suddenly, bringing everyone out of the slight 
stupor they&#39;d been in from his undoubtedly fascinating talk about 
&#39;shaping the future citizens of this great nation&#39; and &#39;the pride of 
every teacher who sends an educated student out into the world,&#39; &quot;...I&#39;d 
like to take a moment to honor the student of the graduating class who 
recieved the highest GPA out of all his classmates. Kisuke Urahara, 
please come up to the stage.&quot;

Yoruichi gaped at the anouncement, wondering if she heard wrong while 
her friend nearly fell over in his chair, equally disbelieving.

&quot;Huh. Guess I passed those classes after all,&quot; Kisuke muttered with a 
grin as Yamamoto called his name again, and he slipped past Yoruichi, 
doing his best to ignore the eyes following his every movement up to the 
stage. Yoruichi smiled, clapping as loudly as she could as he recieved a 
certificate from the Principal, the rest of the school nearly 
overpowering her as he came down, trying to hide a rare look of 
embarassment as he passed his long-time friend.

&quot;Congrats. I always knew you were really a nerd,&quot; Yoruichi teased as she 
playfully ruffled his blonde hair. Just like the old days. Now, she 
really DID feel like everything was all right between her and Kisuke.

----------

As the student body stood up as one and sang their Farewell, ushering in 
the end of the ceremony at last, Soi stole a glance behind her, to the 
golden eyes framed by dark skin that would no longer walk these halls 
with her. She smiled-- just a bit-- when Yoruichi locked eyes with her, 
a silent assurance of her presence visible on whispering lips.Yoruichi 
blinked, silent for what felt like an eternity as the freshman&#39;s words 
sunk in. She sighed, setting down her spoon to look Soi in the eye.

&quot;...What do you mean, you want me to go?&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi, it&#39;s not like that...&quot;

&quot;But...I thought you wanted me to stay.&quot;

&quot;I...I do,&quot; Soi admitted sheepishly as she fiddled absentmindedly with 
her spoon. Yoruichi stuttered for a moment in response, confused by the 
other girl&#39;s seemingly contradictory logic.

&quot;Then why?...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to give up an opportunity like this because of me.&quot;

&quot;Soi, I&#39;m not giving up anything that special...&quot; Yoruichi said after a 
moment, but Soi cut her off.

&quot;Do you remember when you first told me about that trip?&quot; The senior 
paused, then nodded when the recollection hit her. &quot;...You looked so 
happy-- like you&#39;d just won the lottery or something. And it was hard 
for me, at the time, to imagine you going away or being out of my life 
for any amount of time. But... I can&#39;t be selfish. I want you to be 
happy too, Yoruichi.&quot;

&quot;But...I AM happy,&quot; Yoruichi insisted, reaching a hand over to squeeze 
the smaller, pale one lying prone on the table.

&quot;Yoruichi,&quot; Soi whispered as she placed her other palm atop that of the 
upperclassman, &quot;...If it was me... would you keep me from going? From 
seeing the world, learning things I couldn&#39;t learn here?&quot;

It took Yoruichi a long while, a long period of silence to shake her 
head &#39;no.&#39;

&quot;...Of course not. I... I couldn&#39;t hold you back like that.&quot;

&quot;I feel the same,&quot; Soi responded, smiling at Yoruichi even as she felt 
her eyes begin to itch. &quot;Yoruichi... you HAVE to go. You&#39;ll regret this 
if you don&#39;t. And I KNOW that you still want to go.&quot;

&quot;...Yes,&quot; the dark-skinned girl said, barely over a whisper. &quot;Soi, I... 
I still do.&quot; The freshman nodded, doing her best to just keep smiling, 
bowing her head in the hopes that Yoruichi wouldn&#39;t see the tears slowly 
beginning to crawl down her cheeks. But she made no protest when 
Yoruichi pulled her close, her warmth allowing a bit of strength to flow 
back into Soi.

&quot;Just...just do o-one thing for me...&quot;

&quot;Anything,&quot; Yoruichi whispered into the younger girl&#39;s hair, wanting to 
do the same but knowing that it wasn&#39;t her who was really being the 
strong one at this moment.

&quot;...Just write me. N-not often, just once or twice a month...o-or 
whenever you get the...time...&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding? I&#39;m gonna send you so many letters you&#39;ll be sick of 
them.&quot;

In spite of herself, Soi laughed, and the sound of her sobs mingled with 
brave chuckling made Yoruichi hold her a little tighter.

----------

The bell rang, and as if on cue every student in Rukongai High School 
let out a holler and rushed out of their homerooms, their summer break 
finally begun. Urahara, if for no other reason than pure nostalgia, 
glanced about the room, lingering as his classmates left, grinning and 
trading congratulatory slaps on the back. He was finally about to leave, 
diploma secured under the crook of his left arm when he looked up, 
finding Yoruichi leaning against the door.

&quot;Hi, Kisuke.&quot;

He found it was a bit harder for him to smile than before, but all the 
same accomplished the task.

&quot;Well... ready to get outta here? Into the &#39;real world?&#39;&quot; The 
cocoa-toned girl cracked a grin.

&quot;Listen, about everything, I--&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi, listen to me,&quot; the blonde interrupted, sobering if only 
slightly. &quot;...You&#39;ve done nothing terrible, or unforgiveable, or 
malicious. So don&#39;t think for a minute that you need to apologize.&quot; The 
girl nodded silently in response, swallowing her words. The room was 
silent as she tried to think of something else to say.

&quot;So... If everything was okay... why didn&#39;t you call me back? I was 
trying to...well, make sure you weren&#39;t still...&quot;

&quot;Oh-- sorry about that,&quot; Kisuke admitted with a grin as he pulled out a 
folded-up piece of paper from his pocket. &quot;I had to take a trip up to 
Tokyo; the Entrance Exam postings were released this weekend.&quot; Eyes 
widening at his offhand revelation, Yoruichi took the paper and unfolded 
it, gasping as she read it over again.

&quot;Th-this is...&quot;

&quot;...I didn&#39;t wanna tell you I took the exam &#39;til I knew for sure, so--!&quot; 
Urahara was interrupted as Yoruichi roughly threw her arms around him, 
embracing her friend in a tight hug.

&quot;Kisuke, this is AMAZING! Tokyo University?!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he quipped, uncertain of what to do with his hands, &quot;...I 
figured with you moving on, it was time for me to go too.&quot; Yoruichi 
chuckled, tightening her hold on her friend, head resting slightly on 
his shoulder.

&quot;...Thank you, Kisuke. For everything.&quot;

The blonde said nothing as Yoruichi continued to hug him, just slid his 
own arms up to return the embrace.

----------

Soi wandered the halls of the Senior floor, glancing around at the 
deserted classrooms, the gaggles of upperclassman hanging around, 
talking, staging mock fights with their diploma holders as weapons. She 
nearly flinched as she caught Ichimaru and his girlfriend Rangiku 
leaning against one of the lockers, but to her surprise Gin only spared 
a glance in her direction, giving the girl the slightest of nods. 
Rangiku glared at her boyfriend before smiling at Soi, giving her a wave 
and promising that they&#39;d hang out one of these days, maybe get drunk 
when she was older.

Soi was polite, as usual, but kept scanning the hallway, not certain of 
where Yoruichi could be. She smiled as she heard that familiar voice, 
friendly and just a bit catty, around the corner, and found the 
no-longer-senior with a gaggle of others, all of them taking pictures 
and laughing and reminiscing on the past like a bunch of old-timers.

She didn&#39;t think it was possible, but Yoruichi&#39;s smile widened even more 
when she caught sight of Soi approaching.

&quot;Hey, Soi-chan!&quot; Kisuke called with an arm draped playfully around 
Yoruichi&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Aren&#39;t you ready to go home? Most of the freshman 
have already left!

&quot;Well, I just...&quot; Soi began, but smiled when she realized she didn&#39;t 
really have a reason. Just to see Yoruichi once more in her uniform 
before she left, to cement in her mind that all this really had 
happened.

&quot;Hey, I know!&quot; Urahara said as he disengaged himself from Yoruichi, the 
friend across from them getting his camera ready for another picture, 
&quot;...You should get one of you with Yoruichi!&quot;

&quot;Oh no, I couldn&#39;t impo--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a great idea,&quot; Yoruichi interrupted as she grabbed Soi&#39;s hand 
squeezing it just slightly as they got into position before Soi could 
process this unexpected turn of events. She didn&#39;t have any pictures of 
Yoruichi, much less of them together, so she supposed that it would be a 
nice keepsake.

She wasn&#39;t certain of what to do with herself, how close she should be 
to the one she loved if she was still self-conscious about their 
relationship. But to her surprise Yoruichi put an arm around her 
shoulder, pulling her close like Kisuke had her, but the constant 
pressure of her embrace-- something protective and gentle and infinitely 
loving-- told Soi that it was nothing like her picture with her friends.

Soi hoped she wasn&#39;t blushing too hard as the flash went off, freezing 
the moment in time for eternity.</pre>
