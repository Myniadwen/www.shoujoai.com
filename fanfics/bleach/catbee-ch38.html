Yoruichi was somewhat grateful (and almost frustrated) that the music 
never dropped below a fever pitch for the rest of the night. Soi 
appeared to have forgotten the awkwardness however, or she was too busy 
having a good time to care. It was nearly 11:00 before they finally 
left, stumbling slightly from mirth and the rapidly fading high of 
dancing.

&quot;God-- You were right, Soi.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the freshman muttered, distracted from moving to the tune running 
on loop in her head. &quot;...What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;...You CAN&#39;T dance at all.&quot; She flashed a teasing grin at the smaller 
girl, surprised when Soi failed to blush in shame and instead fired 
back, deadpan expression making it clear that she wasn&#39;t offended.

&quot;Oh come on, Yoruichi-san-- I thought I did pretty well for my first 
time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess only YOU would think that this--&quot; Yoruichi paused and 
began jerking erratically to an imaginary rhythm in a crude imitation of 
her friend, which nonetheless made Soi struggle to hold back her 
laughter, &quot;...made for good moves.&quot;

&quot;O-okay, okay, give me a break...&quot; Soi replied, wiping a tear away from 
her eyes as she finally broke into a fit of giggling.

&quot;See? Even YOU think you suck!&quot; the senior teased as she automatically 
threw an arm around Soi&#39;s neck, pulling her into a friendly (if still 
painful) headlock. She didn&#39;t realize until a moment later just how 
close she was to the girl, but her first instinct to move was stifled 
when she realized it would look strange for her to recoil without 
warning. She let go soon enough, her friend still smiling happily from 
the afterglow of their outing, not a word spoken until they&#39;d reached 
the car. It occured to Yoruichi as she watched Soi get inside the 
vehicle that SHE was still smiling too, that for all Soi&#39;s ineptitude at 
dancing it didn&#39;t seem like she&#39;d ever been this happy in a social 
setting with another person before. But then, Soi wasn&#39;t like anyone 
else she&#39;d met, and certainly not like anyone she&#39;d dated in her life. 
Being with her felt like something different altogether.

----------

&quot;...So... you&#39;re fifteen now, huh?&quot;

Soi turned from the window, aware of how much the ride back felt like 
the first as she did so. She could tell that Yoruichi was trying to 
start a conversation, anything at all to fill up the silence that 
consumed the small cabin of the sedan, but she responded nonetheless.

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;...Feel any different?&quot;

&quot;Not much,&quot; Soi answered even though she knew it was a lie. Everything 
felt strange, felt new, felt different now. She&#39;d never had any real, 
lasting friends before last year, never had a real birthday party before 
last year. Had never been in love before last year. Had never been so 
close and so far from someone she cared for so deeply that she felt like 
her heart was constantly being squeezed to death.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s how it goes when you get older,&quot; Yoruichi replied 
wistfully. &quot;You just kinda stop looking forward to adding another year 
to the total.&quot; The older girl let out a sigh as the yellow light she was 
trying to beat turned red, forcing her to bring the car to a halt. 
Minutes later she was ready to begin complaining about the unending 
string of traffic ahead of them when Soi spoke up.

&quot;...Thank you, Yoruichi-san.&quot;

Yoruichi said nothing as she made eye contact with Soi, though in truth 
she didn&#39;t trust herself to speak. She cast a glance back at the light 
to make sure it was still red, but her eyes immediately wandered back to 
the girl beside her, refusing to move again. Suddenly she catches a hint 
of movement-- Soi begins to lean towards her, eyes barely discernable in 
the low light but bearing something familiar nontheless. Yoruichi opened 
her mouth in silent protest, felt her knuckles tense as she put the 
steering wheel in a death grip.

Just do it, something in her implored, and as quick as it had come she 
shook it away.

Stop it. You&#39;re stronger than this, she repeated to herself. But even so 
Yoruichi felt her body go numb just like last time, felt her eyes start 
to slide shut as the girl got closer, the screaming voice of protest in 
her head gradually being silenced by a gentle urging forward. In 
reality, Soi had only closed the distance slightly when the car behind 
them let out a string of loud honks, snapping both driver and passenger 
out of their daze. Yoruichi said nothing as she immediately put the car 
back in gear, and Soi continued her silent vigil of the passenger-seat 
window.

&quot;...Happy Birthday, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi said once the awkwardness had worn 
off a bit, and Soi gave a listless sort of affirmation. This was too 
hard for her, just being this close. She was a fool to have thought that 
she could keep this hidden forever. She had to get away from Yoruichi as 
soon as she could.

----------

&quot;...What the..?&quot; Yoruichi queried once the car turned onto Soi&#39;s street, 
met with the flashing of police lights on a solitary car waiting outside 
a darkened home. &quot;Soi, is that YOUR house?&quot; Yoruichi asked in disbelief. 
The freshman only stared, fear immediately taking root in the pit of her 
stomach; she began breathing slowly but quietly in the hopes that her 
paranoia was unfounded. When Yoruichi came to a stop behind the police 
car she knew that she wasn&#39;t just imagining things.

&quot;...Do you live here?&quot; the crew-cut officer asked once Soi stepped out 
of the car, Yoruichi watching silently from the driver&#39;s seat. &quot;If not, 
I&#39;ll have to ask you to leave.&quot;

&quot;Y-yes, I do! What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Am I correct in assuming, then, that you&#39;re Zhou Fong&#39;s daughter?&quot; Soi 
almost wanted to hit the uniformed man for asking such an obvious 
question, but she subdued the urge and nodded. &quot;...In that case, I&#39;ll 
need you to follow me. We&#39;ve been trying to contact next-of-kin for the 
last half-hour and no one&#39;s been answering at your hou--&quot;

&quot;Will you PLEASE just tell me what&#39;s happening?!&quot; The officer didn&#39;t 
show any sign of shock at the girl&#39;s sudden outburst; he simply waited 
for her to calm before he answered.

&quot;Miss Fong, your father was involved in a serious automobile accident a 
little over three hours ago. Now please, I&#39;ll need you to follow me to 
the hospital, ma&#39;am.&quot; He got into his car without a word, not daring to 
look at the recipient of his ill news again.

&quot;...Soi!&quot; Yoruichi called once she&#39;d watched the policeman return to his 
vehicle, then back out of the driveway as if waiting for something. 
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; The girl said nothing, but the ashen tone of her 
already pale skin when she turned around told the upperclassman all she 
needed to know.</pre>
