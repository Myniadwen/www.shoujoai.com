<h1>Chocolate Kiss</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bleach/index.html">Bleach</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbfg.html">Thecrazyrabbidfangirl</a><br> </h2>
<pre>All of Soul Society was in an uproar: cries of &quot;It&#39;s the apocalypse!&quot; 
and &quot;WE&#39;RE ALL DOOMED!&quot; could be heard as a visible cloud of dust seemed 
to be running all over Seireitei. The worst thing that could ever happen 
in all of Soul Society had happened today. Yachiru Kusajishi... was out 
of candy! Yachiru was tearing all of Seireitei apart searching for the 
sweets she desired so badly. She ran through division after division. 
Captain Creepy definitely didn&#39;t have any candy and shooed her out as he 
was busy with his research. Captain Lazy just dumped some scented sakura 
petals on her to get her to leave, and Byakushi was all out of confetti 
candy.

Yachiru slumped to the ground in a huff outside the 6th division 
barracks as she wondered where she could find more candies, particularly 
chocolate - she loved chocolate. Then it hit her. &quot;The 5th division!&quot; 
she cried with glee as she jumped up and sped towards the 5th squad 
barracks. 

&#39;In the past, before captain four-eyes betrayed everybody,&#39; Yachiru 
huffed angrily at the thought, &#39;I always got sweet candies from bun 
head!&#39; Yachiru&#39;s eyes lit up as fantasies of her rolling around in 
mounds of chocolaty candy played through her head. Yachiru ran the 5th 
division&#39;s door down and headed straight for Momo-Fuku-Taichou&#39;s office.

Momo was sitting quietly, thinking of her recently departed captain and 
sullenly looked down at the paper work which still hadn&#39;t gotten done 
due to the depressed-like dazes she kept having as of late. Suddenly her 
office door was very literally and very violently plowed down by a small 
pink object that landed on her desk, scattering her paperwork. 

&quot;Hey bun head!&quot; Yachiru cried happily as her eyes lit up like stars. &quot;Do 
you have any candies for me?!&quot; she asked hurriedly to the still startled 
Momo. &quot;Well...&quot; Momo thought as she recovered from her previous shock. 
&quot;I think I have a couple of chocolate kisses around here somewhere, it&#39;s 
some new human-world candy that Shiro-Chan brought back for me...&quot; She 
trailed off as she opened up her desk drawers, rummaged through them and 
found the aluminum wrapped candies. 

Momo turned back to face Yachiru. &quot;Here you go-&quot; Momo was caught off 
guard as the pink haired girl launched forward and all but glued her 
face to Momo&#39;s in a needy kiss. Momo went scarlet as she felt Yachiru 
slide her tongue out over Momo&#39;s lips and pulled back quickly with a 
disappointed look on her face. &quot;That didn&#39;t taste like chocolate at 
all!&quot; Yachiru huffed, jumped off of Momo&#39;s desk, and like lightning left 
through the battered doorframe. 

Momo, still scarlet in the face, touched her lips as thoughts of her old 
captain were replaced by a pink haired Fuku-Taichou. &quot;Who knew candies 
could lead to that much sweetness...&quot; Momo wondered to herself as she 
recomposed herself and tried to fix her scattered stacks of paperwork.
