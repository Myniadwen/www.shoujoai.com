&quot;Remember, if either of you need something, just call. Okay?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about us, Kisuke,&quot; Yoruichi assured her friend with a grin. 
&quot;I&#39;ll take care of her.&quot; With that the blonde waved goodbye, and once he 
was gone she closed the front door and slid the lock with a click. The 
senior turned to find Soi&#39;s back to her, a duffel bag full of clothes 
still slung over her shoulder.

&quot;Do you have all your stuff?&quot; Soi flinched at the unexpected question, 
then turned to face her friend with her neutral expression still in 
place.

&quot;...I think I&#39;ve got everything.&quot; At once the uncomfortable silence 
saturated the room again, and in an effort to shake it off Yoruichi 
placed a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t look so gloomy! Let&#39;s try to have fun while you&#39;re here, 
okay? We can try to get some movies tomorrow or something...&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Soi began to walk across the deep carpet as she spoke, then was 
about to put her bag down when she hesitated. &quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s an empty bedroom upstairs on the left,&quot; the older girl replied 
to the unspoken question with a bit of a chuckle. &quot;And hey, there&#39;s a 
bathroom in there-- why don&#39;t you take a shower? I&#39;m sure you could use 
one.&quot;

&quot;...Okay,&quot; Soi answered, offering a feeble attempt at a smile that only 
made Yoruichi more worried. &quot;...Thank you.&quot; The upperclassman wanted to 
say something more as she watched her friend ascend the staircase, but 
she decided instead to busy herself with finding a clean set of sheets. 
The upstairs bedroom hadn&#39;t been used in years, after all.

------------------------------------

Soi wrung the last bit of water out of her hair, carrying the silver 
hoops that normally hung at the end of her braids with the rest of her 
used clothing. Over her slightly damp skin was a large sleepshirt, and 
in her listlessness she&#39;d decided to simply remain in her underwear 
instead of her normal attire of baggy flannel pants. She sat on the edge 
of the freshly made bed, comforted slightly by the feel of the cool 
sheets on her legs as she began folding her clothes up, then forming a 
pile on the floor near the bedstand, a small lamp casting warm light in 
the otherwise spartan environment. She didn&#39;t move when a light knock on 
the door announced Yoruichi&#39;s arrival.

&quot;Hey! Are you feeling more comfortable?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot; Soi muttered, placing her spaghetti-strap on top of the dirty 
clothes, which Yoruichi took note of.

&quot;You fold dirty clothes?&quot; she teased, to which Soi did nothing.

&quot;I just thought I&#39;d save you some trouble. You don&#39;t need to worry; I 
can wash them tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;No Soi-- don&#39;t apologize! Hey, are you sure you&#39;ve got everything you 
need in here?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m...I&#39;m just fi...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a little chilly in here...I could turn up the thermostat if you--&quot; 
Yoruichi paused as the unfamiliar sound of subdued hiccuping hit her 
ears. Puzzled, she turned around to find Soi hunched slightly, her 
shoulders quivering and a few flecks of water sliding down the hands 
gripping her skinny knees. As the Chinese girl&#39;s gasps became hoarser 
and her whimpers louder Yoruichi stared; even though she knew the best 
thing for her to do would have been to stay out of Soi&#39;s business she 
sat beside her instead, placing a tentative hand on her shoulder, not 
feeling nearly as comfortable with the simple act as she had before. 
&quot;...Soi? Are...are you okay?&quot;

The freshman looked up at Yoruichi, her formally impassive face lined 
with the streaks of fresh tears, her shoulders heaving with each breath 
in a futile attempt to keep everything she&#39;d been feeling over the last 
few hours subdued. Yoruichi stared, bewildered to see the girl looking 
so delicate, so fragile, so far from the friend she&#39;d known for the 
better part of a year. She was still uncertain of what to do when Soi 
threw herself forward, desperately wrapping her arms around Yoruichi&#39;s 
waist.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Yoruichi-s-san...I...Oh, God...&quot; the girl whispered 
through her weeping, words half-choked in her throat while she clung to 
Yoruichi, face buried into her shoulder. Meanwhile the older of the two 
sat frozen, eyes wide with shock and hands hovering uncertainly near 
Soi&#39;s back. She wanted to comfort Soi, but she didn&#39;t know what to say; 
she was completely foreign to being held by someone in emotional 
turmoil, especially when Soi backed away from all but the most neutral 
contact. She&#39;d only seen Soi in tears once now, but it only took her a 
moment to realize that as she felt Soi&#39;s weight against her and the 
wetness of tears on her shoulder that she hated it.

&quot;I-It&#39;s okay...&quot; Yoruichi responded quietly, putting her arms carefully 
around Soi&#39;s shoulders. Right now she just had to hold her, hold her and 
calm her down. But Soi was so warm, something about having her this 
close was against everything she&#39;d warned herself about but at the same 
time...it almost felt like she fit perfectly in her arms.

&quot;N-no it&#39;s n-not...I-i-it&#39;s my fault he got hurt...It&#39;s all m-m-my 
fault...&quot;

&quot;Soi...you know that&#39;s not true.&quot;

&quot;Y-YES IT IS! I SHOULD&#39;VE B-B-BEEN HOME!! H-HE WOULD&#39;VE B-BEEN ALL RIGHT 
I-IF I&#39;D J-JUST STAYED T-THERE AND WAITED FOR HIM!! I...&quot; Soi choked, 
was quiet as she tried to compose herself again. &quot;...I s-sh-should&#39;ve 
been w-with D-d-dad...&quot;

&quot;Soi, don&#39;t talk like that!&quot; Yoruichi insisted, the sight of the younger 
girl still in tears bothering her more by the second.

&quot;H-he&#39;s all I&#39;ve g-g-got! Wh-what if h-he&#39;d DIED today?! Wh-what would I 
have d-done? I&#39;d be b-better off if I-I&#39;d b-b-been there too... I-I 
can&#39;t do a-anything for myself...I&#39;m j-j-just a dumb, u-ugly girl who 
can&#39;t even c-cook on h-her own--&quot; She went silent, wide-eyed as Yoruichi 
suddenly pulled her into a hug tighter than a vice, making it difficult 
to breathe. In spite of herself, she turned a slightly deeper shade of 
red as she felt Yoruichi whisper softly beside her.

&quot;...You know that&#39;s a bunch of bullshit, Soi. Do you really think your 
Dad would be happy with you beat up in the hospital bed right next to 
him? And &#39;helpless&#39;-- I know middle-aged adults that don&#39;t have it 
together nearly as much as you do.&quot; Yoruichi felt herself breathe a 
little easier as Soi&#39;s tearful gasps came fewer and farther between. 
&quot;...Soi...Don&#39;t ever say that you&#39;d be better off dead again. Don&#39;t EVER 
wish that. And just so you know... you&#39;re not ugly. Not at all.&quot;

&quot;...Y-yeah, right...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; Yoruichi insisted even as the younger girl gave a weak 
snort in disbelief. It was true that the first time she&#39;d seen Soi she&#39;d 
looked right away, hadn&#39;t even noticed. But her beauty wasn&#39;t anything 
like the kind she was used to; it was so much more subtle, something you 
grew to appreciate more as you saw her, as she grew on you. Even now, 
with her long hair matted across her shoulders and her eyes red from 
tears, Yoruichi felt her eyes remained glued to Soi, never shifting 
their focus no matter how much she tried to urge herself to stop.

&quot;I...I&#39;m s-sorry...&quot; the freshman said quietly, loosening her grip on 
the midsection of Yoruichi&#39;s turtleneck. &quot;Y-You&#39;ve been so good to me, 
Yoruichi-s-san, and I just...&quot;

&quot;No...You&#39;re just upset. It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. You don&#39;t have 
to be so strong all the time. Besides,&quot; Yoruichi continued as she leaned 
in with a bit of a smile, &quot;...I&#39;d be pretty bad off if something 
happened to you. I don&#39;t have many friends without SOME kind of rhythm.&quot;

It took Soi a moment for the unexpected joke to take effect, but when it 
did she was shuddering with embarressed laughter, a smile lighting up 
her tearstreaked face. It instantly made Yoruichi&#39;s smile widen, just 
knowing that Soi still had that grin on her face, that was so 
wonderfully and uniquely hers.

Without thinking she bent her head forward, just enough to plant a light 
kiss on Soi&#39;s forehead. It only took the two of them a moment to realize 
what Yoruichi had done, but before either girl could address the subject 
further Soi&#39;s hiccups started up again. Yoruichi gave a light scoff, 
setting the mood back to its relative ease.

&quot;...How about I get you a glass of water?&quot; Soi nodded gratefully as 
Yoruichi released her grip on the younger girl and walked out of the 
room, letting the door shut behind her.

---------------------------------------- ----

It wasn&#39;t until she reached the light of the kitchen that Yoruichi 
realized her hands were trembling slightly. She assured herself that it 
was just anxiety getting to her, but even so she was a little more 
forceful than normal as she grabbed a tall glass from her cupboard, then 
set it in the sink as she turned the water on, letting it fill. She 
watched it disinterestedly for a few seconds, took out the cloth and 
ribbon that held her ponytail up as she sighed, but soon enough her 
thoughts returned to the girl upstairs. She hadn&#39;t meant to do something 
like that to Soi just now-- it was the last thing in the world she 
thought someone as distant and brutal as her was capable of, but even so 
the freshman just seemed to bring it out in her with incredible ease.

Yoruichi knew that she wanted Soi-- she&#39;d been aware of it for a while 
but wasn&#39;t sure when exactly the desire had taken root. But she&#39;d never 
subdued the urge like this-- if she wanted someone she had them, no 
matter what. So why couldn&#39;t she just take her, get this out of her head 
once and for all?

God-- what&#39;s WRONG with me, she wondered quietly. Soi nearly lost her 
father today and I&#39;m...

It didn&#39;t matter how badly she wanted this now, wanted her. Soi wasn&#39;t 
just another &#39;someone&#39;--she was strong but she was also too sweet, too 
kind, too innocent, too beautiful for her own good. She couldn&#39;t let Soi 
just fall for someone like her, someone who treated lovers like dolls, 
tossing them away at a moment&#39;s notice. She needed a FRIEND, not a 
lover, and even though Yoruichi wasn&#39;t the best one suited for the job 
she could still fulfill it as best she could.

But how long could she keep it up? It didn&#39;t help that this whole thing 
with Soi-- it was so different, not because she was a girl (Yoruichi was 
no stranger to her own gender) but because of this strange choking 
feeling she got in her chest whenever she so much as glanced at her, 
whenever she got close. Yoruichi felt her train of thought derail as she 
suddenly looked down and realized the glass had been overflowing for 
quite a while, the faucet never having been turned off. Quickly 
correcting the problem, she heaved a sigh while pouring the excess 
liquid down the sink.

This isn&#39;t me, Yoruichi pondered. This isn&#39;t like me at all. I don&#39;t get 
crushes like a grade-schooler. Not over people like her. I just have to 
deal with it.

She didn&#39;t want to go back in Soi&#39;s room tonight, not with all this in 
her head, but deciding that the freshman probably needed the promised 
beverage, she shook off her uncertainty and climbed the stairs.

-----------------------------------

Yoruichi gave the door another light tap as before, letting Soi know she 
was there just a moment before opening the door. The room hadn&#39;t changed 
at all since she&#39;d been there last: the Chinese girl was still sitting 
on the bed with the covers slightly open, the lamp was still emanating a 
low orange tint. Soi looked up and gave Yoruichi the slightest of smiles 
as she wiped her face with the back of her arm; the older of the two 
tensed imperceptibly but continued forward unabated.

&quot;Hey, sorry I took so long-- you didn&#39;t have to wait up for me.&quot; Soi 
shrugged a little, almost casually. Just like they were friends. She 
held the water out to Soi, who in turn reached for it with her left 
hand.

&quot;...Thank you.&quot; As she reached the cup her fingers grazed Yoruichi&#39;s 
hand, both flinching slightly at the jolt of electricity that flowed 
through them at that moment. Soi tried to displace her hand and Yoruichi 
almost wanted to move from the point of contact, but somehow her palm 
never strayed as Soi set the glass down, appendages remaining just 
barely touching. It felt as though they were both acutely aware of their 
distance, the motion having brought Yoruichi only a few inches away from 
Soi&#39;s face, but neither moved or tried to speak. Yoruichi just sat 
there, staring into Soi&#39;s eyes, the scent of clean linen hanging on her 
only working to further her enchantment. She knew this was too strong, 
that if she stayed another second she wouldn&#39;t be able to hold back, 
that she had to leave NOW.

Neither of them knew who moved first; it was just the gradual closing of 
distance, lips hesitantly meeting in a chaste kiss. Yoruichi recoiled 
slowly, strangely off-balance but the taste she&#39;d only been hinted at 
before took hold of her again, and before she&#39;d backed away even an inch 
she moved forward again, met halfway by an equally hazy-eyed Soi Fong.

For a few minutes they just sat there, Yoruichi trying to push away with 
her right hand only to have it entangled in Soi&#39;s short locks, felt it 
carress her hair with a gentleness the wealthy often showed to the 
finest and most priceless of fabrics; the whole time they were inching 
ever closer to each other, the kiss deepening, Soi&#39;s formally hesitant 
mouth widening to grant Yoruichi entrance, which she hungrily accepted.

Soi&#39;s hands found their way to the taller girl&#39;s shoulders, felt a 
thrill run down her spine as Yoruichi quivered, partly from the 
unexpected contact and bliss from Soi&#39;s fingers dancing across her 
shoulders, the sweater in between skin and hands doing nothing to lessen 
its potency. Meanwhile Yoruichi&#39;s free hand had taken a slow, luxurious 
path down Soi&#39;s shirt, sliding underneath once she reached the garment&#39;s 
hem. Her brain was still putting up a feeble resistance at this point; 
her body was moving of its own volition despite repeated mental 
protests.

After what seemed like forever passed Yoruichi finally gathered the 
resolve to break the kiss, despite the fact that her eyes were shut 
tight, body aching for more, her hands desperate to keep exploring that 
delicate porcelain skin. There was still a chance that she could stop 
this-- break this off right now and just--

&quot;...Yoruichi...&quot;

In an instant she froze, her brain stopped working, Soi&#39;s words ringing 
through her ears. The younger girl pulled herself so close to Yoruichi 
that there was barely any breathing room between them; her stormy eyes 
had darkened to a smoldering grey, her face a deep crimson and her mouth 
open slightly as she visibly struggled to remember how to breathe.

&quot;Yoruichi...&quot;

Never in her life had the dark-skinned girl heard her own name sound 
more beautiful, more hypnotic in her life as Soi whispered it in a voice 
of long-repressed desire, and combined with the intoxicating smell and 
taste and texture of her Yoruichi finally stopped fighting. She 
willfully wrapped her lips around Soi&#39;s again, drowning in the maelstrom 
of blind emotion as she grew drunk on the flavor of her, every breath 
holding Yoruichi in the mind-foging aroma of her hair.

For the time being, the world beyond Soi no longer existed for Yoruichi; 
no longer mattered. She slid the girl carefully beneath her as they fell 
to the bed, and while Yoruichi kissed her neck she heard a moan that 
surpassed that of every lover she&#39;d ever had.</pre>
