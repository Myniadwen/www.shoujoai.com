<h1>Timeless</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bleach/index.html">Bleach</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rekino.html">Rekino</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Music: Music is the premise of inspiration, the birth of thought, what 
moves us, what brings us down. It can sway our minds, move our bodies. 
Music is just and we move to the music of our soul even though not all 
may agree.

Dance: Dance is an act more elegant than life, birth, more elegant than 
death. An act of beauty, a management of limbs, a means of sweet 
seduction, fiery passion, pure friendship, or, perhaps, all of those 
combined. Dance is expression.

Tears: Tears are an outlet, never one to be otherwise. Salty tears of 
anger, hot tears of disappointment, light tears of joy and sorrowful 
tears of sadness, everyone cries every now and then and tears always 
give away whatever mood you may be in at the time.

Breath: Breath is our exhalation of life, proof of existence. A means 
for breathing, a means for truth. We breathe in and out our meaning 
daily, we breathe in and out what we say. We mix breaths with those we 
love, those we adore, even.

Time: Time is never-ending, time is omnipotent and time is past, present 
and the future combined.


Shizuru/Natsuki; music Join me in my music, hear me play. Let it command 
you, let it own you, I&#39;ll catch you when you lose yourself, it&#39;s a 
promise I&#39;ll never break.

The sweeping sounds of a cello elegantly filled the room; one layer of 
sweet melody swept over the room, then one, then another, nothing but a 
calm sea, a calm fluidity about, peaceful, for once. Shizuru&#39;s nimble 
fingers went to work then, strumming the instrument as she continued to 
deftly (and, successfully) extract the right tunes from the chords she 
wished, more fast-paced, more urgent, more commanding than earlier.

A sudden sea of calmness proceeded to follow after the sea itself had 
begun to rock, subtle crashing white waves of music broken only when the 
sea became rough, the music began to climax, when the melody began to 
heighten, began to pick up; faster, desperate, and eager. It continued. 
Its bearings continuous, Shizuru&#39;s normally smiling and enigmatic face 
gone now, replaced with one of thoughtful concentration, brows furrowed 
lightly, eyes fluttered shut, and feeling the music control her, move 
her, sweep over her, feel the music own her.

It was dragging her down, pulling her with it.

Shizuru was moving, hand brushing back and forth through the chords, 
another on the apparatus that pressed down and elicited the exact notes 
she wished, eyes closed, so close, so near finishing, her head almost 
jerking up, but fingers never stopping from their accurate movements 
after hearing a new addition in the form of the ever-so-sultry tunes of 
a violin join in with her cello.

She turned about, hair flicking over her shoulder as she turned to give 
Natsuki a look of bewilderment. Natsuki didn&#39;t speak, letting her music 
speak for her rather, eyes closed, standing, neck tilted as she began to 
sway, playing her violin to her heart&#39;s content, fast, proud and mixing 
beautifully with Shizuru&#39;s own.

And with a small smile, lashes floating shut, Shizuru threw herself more 
into her music, letting the blend of cello and violin fill her heart and 
soul, warming her, especially with Natsuki by her side, Shizuru losing 
herself in the music, knowing Natsuki would be there, right there, to 
catch her, should she ever fall.

Nana/Hachi; dance I promise to take care of you, to never let go of your 
hand, so shall we dance, madam?

Laughter was clear in her eyes, amusement twinkling like a beacon, the 
glow there both inviting and interesting, akin to light in the darkness. 
It was attractive, it was comforting, and it was something Hachi both 
loved and adored. It was purely Nana.

They sat in their living room, parallel to one another on their 
respective seats, some finished drinks about, some littered plates off 
to the side. They talked about dancing, laughing about how dancing with 
a guy could be awkward, strange, fun (depending) and quite painful 
(again, depending) all at the same time; if they (the guy) certainly 
didn&#39;t know where and how to step correctly.

They talked about pacing, talked about timing, talked about how wearing 
dresses could be bothersome and laughing, suddenly struck with an idea, 
Nana ducked to her room quickly, much to Hachi&#39;s initial confusion. She 
returned in a matter of minutes however, gesturing to Hachi with a laugh 
towards her newfound toy, a hand outstretched as she came back with a 
tape player in hand, promptly plugging it into the wall and allowing it 
to whirl into play; the tape already inserted, the song already 
beginning to play.

The sound of the popular song Shall We Dance? floated throughout the 
roam, filling it in sweeping echoes, causing Hachi to burst out in 
instantaneous giggles, trying hard to stifle them by cupping her hands 
over her mouth automatically, eyes smiling as Nana took a deep, manly 
bow, grinning like a child.

Nana offered her hand to Hachi, the encouraging expression on her face 
as she gazed back into Hachi&#39;s amused eyes. And with a laugh, Hachi 
straightening, promptly curtseying to Nana (the guy in this situation) 
she took her hand, matching the grin with her own, following Nana&#39;s lead 
as they danced comfortably, no pain, no awkwardness, no strangeness, 
just fun, just them. Just them alone in the comfort of their own 
apartment, the music still continuing, the dance never-ending.

Just Nana and Hachi.

Sei/Shimako; tears The first time I cried, it wasn&#39;t not because I was 
sad, nor because I was mad but because I was simply happy to be with 
you.

Shimako shuddered under the touches, feeling a hot tongue idly flick at 
her heat eliciting a stifled gasp from her lips, the burning in-between 
her thighs hurting more, normally nonexistent impatience growing. 
Slender fingers managed to hold her steady as her onee-sama continued to 
drive her to become a little more demanding, a little more desperate, a 
little wilder as hips thrust themselves forward, Sei just chuckling in 
amusement as she continued to press her finger in, continued to tease 
her.

A digit sliding in easily and beginning to pump in caused Shimako to 
throw her head back, locks gathering themselves behind her back as hot 
tears began to roll down her cheeks, crying out when more fingers when 
inserted and she was gathered in Sei&#39;s arms, a soft kiss pressed to her 
lips as they continued their love-making in a room where the window was 
left wide open, a night breeze rolling in, moonlight streaming in and 
illuminating Shimako&#39;s clear skin and her tears of passion beautifully, 
the room filled with the sounds of Shimako crying out Sei&#39;s name as she 
came, muffled as Sei covered her mouth over hers to stifle the cry and 
gently kissing away the tears after.

Lisa/Hiyori; breath Breathe for me, live for me and I&#39;ll do the same for 
you. Meet me, hot and hungry and I&#39;ll help you regain your breathing 
too.

Hiyori&#39;s breathing was hitched as she was suddenly shoved up against a 
dirty wall with enough force it caused her to gasp out loud at the 
unexpected feel, mouth parting in soft, unhidden surprise and giving 
Lisa more than ample enough time to sneak her tongue in, press her open 
mouth against Hiyori&#39;s and to snake her tongue inside, plundering her 
entrance without so much as reserve and denial, insistent, ready and 
hungry. Lisa was all of the above. Heat surged through Hiyori&#39;s thighs 
and groaned against those greedy lips, entangling thin hands against 
Lisa&#39;s neck as she thrust hips upwards suggestively, arched her slight 
back to meet those teasing hands, pressing harder and harder, demanding, 
childish, wanton and hungry.

Never one to be left out and always one who caught on quick, and 
impressed those around her with her adaptability, Hiyori suckled hard on 
Lisa&#39;s possessive tongue, slamming her eyes shut in sheer pleasure as 
her crevice was thoroughly explored, her mouth learned and discovered 
before Lisa suddenly pulled away, causing Hiyori to whine in soft demand 
and protest, breathing ragged, her hazel eyes hazed over, a breath 
stolen from her throat.

Only Lisa could do that to her, though Hiyori was certainly never one to 
complain, another breath stolen from her lips when a kiss was planted on 
her forehead, gentle, soft and wispy; a clear sign of love that took her 
breath away.

Yoruichi/Soi Fong; time If I could turn back time, I&#39;d turn it back so I 
could bring you with me.

Broken was her subordinate in front of her, shattered to the point of no 
return. Yoruichi could only hope to bring her back, regain her to what 
she once was, to gathering her back in her arms like she had done many a 
time before, hold her like she had before.

She lowered herself down on one knee, gently coming down on a sweep, 
having watched Soi Fong sink to the ground in tears, her heart breaking 
in the process. Yoruichi extended a hand down on her shoulder, her touch 
heaven-sent for the broken sparrow whose wings had been shot down and 
hurt, her pride wounded, her composure shattered.

This wasn&#39;t the time for repenting, there was hardly any time to regret; 
no time to look back and wish you could have turned back the clock, no 
matter the desire. This was a time for healing, not for otherwise.

Yoruichi spoke then, told Soi Fong of the reasons why she had left; had 
explained to her coolly why bringing Soi would&#39;ve been a dangerous to 
her, something potentially deadly for both women and why she had no 
desire to have (or, see) Soi Fong be hurt in any manner. Even during 
through the soft tears, the complacent sobs, Yoruichi knew Soi Fong was 
listening, was listening intently enough. When her head had perked up 
tentatively like a child and Soi had uttered a low Yoruichi-sama, eyes 
puffy and red, Yoruichi knew everything was going to be okay. She 
wouldn&#39;t abandon this child anymore, would never leave her again, no 
matter what and with a small grin, she stood up, offered her hand and 
said in a voice, the announcement of Aizen&#39;s clear betrayal already 
heard throughout their minds and their new joint objective obvious, Just 
like ol&#39; times, eh?

Soi Fong voiced her agreement with a nostalgic expression.

Just like old times.

Extras:

Lisa/Hiyori; music Sometimes, there is no need for any words. Just the 
sound of our heartbeats, our breathless pants and the heat of our 
bodies.

No words were spoken. There was no need for them. It was only them, no 
one else but them, and there were no need for anyone else. Only ragged 
breathing, subtle gasps, the occasional moans and low grunts were 
noticeable and heard as was the ever-present feeling of heat against 
heat, body against body, skin against skin as fingers continued to dance 
against bare, untouched skin; feathered touches teasing and explorative 
against an arched and slight form that trembled with pleasure, shivering 
as she continued to press down encouragingly on those playful fingers.

Unbound hair came to be entangled against skilled fingers; platinum 
blonde hair toyed with against callous digits, motions suggestive as the 
older woman&#39;s hand shifted and pressed lightly against Hiyori&#39;s wetness, 
the sounds she was rewarded with met with an almost mirthful smile that 
grew on Lisa&#39;s face.

For Lisa, the soft elicited gasp was akin to music to her ears.

Lisa/Hiyori; dance Will you dance with me, dear? To a tune that only we 
know.

The continuous clash of swords was never-ending, the metallic clangs of 
blade against blade was merely an echo and a prelude to their dance; a 
backdrop to their own game, their own way, their own music. A whip 
there, sidestep here, a slash there, pull back, slice, come forward and 
then attack. Like the male lead, Lisa guided Hiyori through each step, 
took her through each one with ease, a satisfied expression dancing and 
quirking about the corners of her mouth and pulling them up for a proud 
smile as Hiyori met her through and through.

Through each step, each slash, each attack. Like the guide Lisa was, she 
prompted Hiyori to respond with equal fervor, to meet her movements one 
by one with as much force as she could extract, and there was a strong 
amount of force behind Hiyori&#39;s attacks. Hiyori faithfully followed, 
never one to disappoint, fighting back gracefully; actions loose, easy 
and simply her. And as twin glimmers of amusement danced in their eyes, 
a twinkle in Lisa&#39;s and a flicker through Hiyori&#39;s, they continued their 
deadly dance, bringing about their swords for, yet another, attack with 
identical smiles on their faces, enjoying the moment, enjoying the 
dance, dancing to a music only they could hear; the music of their 
individual heartbeats and the sounds of their blades roughly making 
contact with one another.

Sei/Shimako; tears I&#39;ll be by your side and do whatever you wish, 
anything you want, anything you desire, I&#39;ll do-- just never let me cry. 
That&#39;s all I ask of you.

The tears fell down her cheek, rolling off the corner of her eye as her 
eyes prickled, burning, insistent, and painful. The wave on wave of 
emotion drove Shimako to tears, the onslaught of sadness inspired from 
watching this move in front of her causing a hand to clutch at her mouth 
in a soft unheard gasp as she continued to watch on, still in disbelief 
that she was affected this much and still entranced with what she was 
watching. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to tear her eyes away from it, no 
matter how much she wished.

The protagonist and his love-interest had broken it off after promises 
of being together forever and much to her (the love interest) belief, 
she&#39;d thoroughly, unmoving, placed her faith within him and he had 
unknowingly shattered her, moving away and leaving her broken; breaking 
their promise in the process. It was heart-breaking and wrenching, this 
movie.

Shimako continued to cry softly, eyes blank, tears just rolling down her 
face as she continued to watch, her eyes hazed over from the bleariness 
of the liquid that she couldn&#39;t bring herself to wipe away. She tried 
her best to blink them into nonexistence after a moment, ashamed and 
blinking in utter surprise when a warm hand covered her own, Sei staring 
straight at the movie with a thoughtful expression.

Fingers clutched at her hand, wrapping and enveloping her cold digits in 
warmth, supportive as Sei made no other sound, Shimako just proceeding 
to cry harder and harder, not as ashamed as before, just hoping, 
praying, wishing that Sei would never her leave her like that. And for 
the moment, that was enough for her, just crying with Sei&#39;s presence by 
her side.
