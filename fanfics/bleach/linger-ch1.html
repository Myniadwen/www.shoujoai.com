<h1>Linger</h1>

<pre>Soi Fong&#39;s eyes fluttered open to find a comforting sight before her. 
She&#39;d fallen asleep with her head on Yoruichi&#39;s heart, her free hand 
laying still on the older woman&#39;s belly. For a moment she just wanted to 
fade back into slumber, wrapped in the cradle of those arms, enveloped 
in the warmth of her Godesses&#39; satiny skin. She smiled dreamily as she 
felt one of Yoruichi&#39;s hands running through her short hair over and 
over again, even as the subconscious intimacy threatened to lay the 
remants of her willpower to ruin. After a few minutes spent in 
half-sleep, savoring the bliss of Yoruichi&#39;s flawless body pressed 
against her own, Soi let out a reluctant sigh then slipped out from the 
former Captain&#39;s embrace. Just as she was about to lift herself from the 
bedsheets, a dark hand gently arrested her wrist.

&quot;Mmm...Where&#39;re you goin&#39;?&quot; The sound of Yoruichi&#39;s voice, slightly 
indescernable in her sleepiness but still hypnotic as ever, made Soi 
hesitate and turn to face her lover. Yoruichi was staring at her from 
behind half-shut eyes, wearing a content smile on her face, and the 
younger girl was too transfixed to notice but the Shihouin was busy 
stroking her thumb along Soi&#39;s wrist in warping, chaotic patterns.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Yoruichi-sama. Did I wake you up?&quot; Soi asked as she 
leaned in to greet her beloved with a kiss, but halfway to her 
destination lost heart and settled with a light peck on the cheek. 
Yoruichi gave a slight chuckle as she shook her head on the pillow, 
feeling both disappointed and amused. Soi had been screaming out her 
name last night, her normally quiet voice overflowing with desire and 
passion, yet the moment the current Second Division Captain could 
maintain any sign of coherence, she went right back to addressing her in 
a formal tone. Yoruichi wanted to say something, but decided that it 
wasn&#39;t worth ruining the moment with bickering right now.

&quot;No, I was just...just getting up myself,&quot; the older woman managed 
through a yawn.

&quot;Hmph. Liar,&quot; Soi answered with a smile as Yoruichi&#39;s hand moved from 
her arm to snake its way around the petite girl&#39;s waist. Wordlessly, but 
wearing a mischevious grin on her face, the Shihouin used her other arm 
to pull herself up, meeting Soi&#39;s lips with her own. For a little while 
Soi just sat there, returning her old master&#39;s passionate kisses with 
equal longing, no sound audible to either of them but the occasional 
moan or gasp for breath. When it felt like hours had passed, Soi gently 
ended the embrace by pulling her tongue out of Yoruichi&#39;s mouth and 
planting a softer kiss on the princess&#39; lower lip. &quot;...I have to go,&quot; 
the Captain said in what came out as a husky whisper, betraying her 
desire to remain in bed with her Goddess.

&quot;Mmm...Oh, come on...&quot; Yoruichi muttered in a daze, the taste of her 
lover&#39;s kiss still fresh in her mouth. Soi almost regretted lingering as 
long as she had-- the look in Yoruichi&#39;s eyes told her that she was 
starving, and not for breakfast. &quot;It&#39;s...not even...morning yet,&quot; the 
dark woman said while she lavished Soi&#39;s face with kisses.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi-sama...the...the sun&#39;s been up for...hours, at least...&quot; 
Soi, meanwhile, was busy trying to gather the resolve to leave, but was 
finding the task near impossible now. &quot;I...I still have to get dressed, 
and the...Correction Corps is...expecting m--!&quot; Her sentence disappeared 
into a gasp as Yoruichi pulled her back down to the bed, using her own 
weight as leverage to pin Soi beneath her. Before she could make any 
form of half-hearted protest, Yoruichi began to lay a row of slow, wet 
kisses along Soi&#39;s throat. &quot;N...no fair...&quot; the Chinese girl whispered 
slowly, even as Yoruichi smiled at the result of her handiwork. It 
wasn&#39;t her fault that she&#39;d figured out where Soi was most...sensitive, 
but she could certainly use the knowledge to her advantage.

&quot;...Just stay...a little longer...&quot;

&quot;I...I can&#39;t...H...have to get back...&quot; Wrong answer, Soi thought even 
as she let it escape her lips. Or the right one, because she trembled 
when she felt Yoruichi&#39;s mouth slide down to her collar bone.

&quot;Five more minutes...&quot;

&quot;Yoruichi-sama...&quot; Soi protested weakly, even as she felt that tongue 
slide lower, along with a pair of fingers gently playing with her 
swollen button. To Yoruichi&#39;s delight, her lover stopped resisting, and 
finally began to arch herself into her fingers, wordlessly urging them 
deeper. As Yoruichi consented, once again making Soi&#39;s mouth issue the 
most beautiful sounds of ecstacy she&#39;d ever heard, she felt an alabaster 
hand run along the side of her face, the tenderness of the act making 
the disgraced princess hesitate. Looking down to see Soi, desperately 
trying to catch her breath and her face red with desire, she heard the 
young girl whisper.

&quot;Well...I guess...I could take...a day off...&quot;

&quot;...That&#39;s more like it,&quot; Yoruichi said with a smile as she leaned in, 
and this time felt Soi&#39;s slender arms wrap around her neck.</pre>
