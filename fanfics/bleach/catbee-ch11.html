It had only started to sprinkle a little, but even so Yoruichi ran for 
the school entrance, leaving behind the much slower Urahara in her wake. 
She could tell just from the sky that it was going to rain today and 
rain hard-- the last few days had been gradually darker and cloudier, 
not to mention the distinct fragrance of lightning on the air was a dead 
giveaway to the athletic upperclassman.

&quot;D...damnit...Yoru-chan...wh...why do you...always have to...do that?&quot; 
Yoruichi turned at the sound of Kisuke&#39;s voice and prepared to punish 
him for using her nickname, but seeing that since he was doubled over 
and clutching a stitch in his chest from trying to keep up with her, 
decided to take mercy on him for once. &quot;I...can&#39;t believe that you STILL 
haven&#39;t gotten over this. How many years has it been, already?&quot;

&quot;Hey, if you&#39;re gonna get bitchy I don&#39;t have a problem with kicking 
your ass,&quot; the tall girl said with a teasing grin, but Urahara recoiled 
all the same.

&quot;H-hi, Yoruichi-san, Urahara-san!&quot; The duo smiled at Soi Fong as she 
walked up, and Yoruichi felt a slight leap that she dismissed as simply 
being glad to see her friend. It had been a few days since the ugliness 
that had transpired in the gym, and by now things had returned to normal 
between them. Even though it had ultimately been little more than a 
misunderstanding, Yoruichi still felt glad that Soi trusted her again.

&quot;Hi, Soi Fong!&quot;

&quot;Hey, shrimp! How&#39;re you doing?&quot; Soi frowned slightly at Urahara&#39;s 
greeting, but shrugged it off when Yoruichi assured her that he was just 
being stupid.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m all right. I&#39;m just glad that it didn&#39;t start raining before I 
got here-- I probably would&#39;ve gotten soaked.&quot;

&quot;Well, I hope you at least brought an umbrella,&quot; Urahara said as he 
looked in Yoruichi&#39;s direction with a wry grin, &quot;...Because it&#39;s 
supposed to pour ALL DAY TODAY.&quot; Soi gave him a curious look before 
turning to Yoruichi to see that she had a very agitated expression on 
her face.

&quot;...Yoruichi-san? Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh...nothing,&quot; Yoruichi answered quickly, haphazardly throwing a 
smile on in the hope of avoiding having to answer. Soi was willing to 
grant her friend the privacy she desired until Urahara spoke up.

&quot;Oh, you mean that Yoruichi hasn&#39;t told y--&quot;

&quot;Shut UP, Kisuke!&quot; the upperclasswoman growled, an uncharacteristic 
amount of urgency in her voice.

&quot;You see, Soi-chan,&quot; Urahara continued, the placing of the freshman 
between him and his female companion giving him confidence to proceed, 
&quot;Yoruichi has a very intriguing phobi--&quot;

&quot;I told you to SHUT UP, DAMNIT!&quot; Yoruichi said in a snarl, trying to get 
at Kisuke to silence him, but he managed to slip through her fingers 
like water.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, Yoruichi--I&#39;m sure that a lot of 
18-year olds are afraid of rainstorms.&quot; The secret out, Yoruichi sighed 
in defeat, her face turning red as she turned away to look at the wall. 
For a moment, Soi could only stare at the back of her friend&#39;s head, 
unable to process that the invincible Yoruichi could possibly have any 
sort of insecurities.

&quot;Um,&quot; the petite girl started cautiously, &quot;...Is that tru--&quot;

&quot;Look, I&#39;m not AFRAID of them,&quot; The upperclassman grumbled as she 
continued walking, too embarrassed to look either of them in the face. 
&quot;...I just don&#39;t like rain, is all.&quot;

&quot;...Don&#39;t forget thunder, too,&quot; Urahara quipped with a smile still on 
his unshaven mug. &quot;I remember that she wouldn&#39;t come on this one class 
trip because she was afraid that the plane would get hit by lightni--&quot;

&quot;THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO, YOU DAMN IDIOT!&quot; Yoruichi shot back, then 
whacked Kisuke so hard on the head that he actually stumbled over, a 
reaction that in turn made Soi suppress a chuckle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Now then,&quot; Rukia called to the rest of the beginners as they finished 
their warm-ups and were seated on the floor, &quot;...Kichiki-sensei has 
decided that the first opportunity you rookies&#39;ll have to test for 
Yellow belt is going to be this Friday at 5:00.&quot; After allowing the 
greenhorns a few moments of excited chatter, the diminuitive Brown-belt 
raised her hand to signal for silence. &quot;Now, I&#39;d like to remind all of 
you that you&#39;ll only have a couple chances to do this in a group 
setting: the time on Friday and then on Saturday at 9:00. After that, 
then you&#39;ll have to ask one of the Black belts to give you a personal 
test. And trust me--they&#39;ll all be much more critical of you if you&#39;re 
being tested one-on-one. In either case, I trust that most of you--&quot; she 
took an opportunity to glare accusingly at Keigo, who was too busy 
daydreaming to notice, &quot;...will do well enough to make me proud. You&#39;ve 
been doing this for a quite a while now, so don&#39;t let your efforts go to 
waste. Is that understood?&quot; The students all gave a nod in the 
affirmative, which satisfied Rukia greatly. &quot;All right-- let&#39;s go over 
the basics, then.&quot;&quot;So...Are you looking forward to Friday?&quot; Yoruichi 
asked Soi as they left the locker room an hour later.

&quot;Oh, uh...well, I guess...&quot; the freshman answered casually, but in truth 
she was literally counting the days until she could take the test. It 
had been a long time since Soi had felt a real sense of accomplishment 
as far as athletics were concerned, and the idea of acquiring something 
to show for her efforts excited the young girl. She&#39;d even been 
practicing a little at home, though in truth she did a lot better when 
Yoruichi went over the routines with her.

&quot;Aw, damnit,&quot; the senior muttered to herself when they opened the gym 
door to see that the rain was still coming down in heavy waves. &quot;I was 
hoping it would&#39;ve let up some, but...&quot; After a few moments of 
indecision, Yoruichi sighed and pulled a collapsible red umbrella out of 
her bookbag, snapping it open with a click as she stepped outside, 
followed quickly by Soi as she opened up a much older one with a plain 
black covering. The freshman nearly yelped as the wind threatened to 
yank the portable shield out of her hands, only succeeding in keeping a 
hold on it thanks to a quick reflex. &quot;Hey, you doin&#39; all right?&quot; 
Yoruichi called back, looking over her shoulder at Soi Fong.

&quot;Y-yeah, I&#39;m fine!&quot; Soi answered as she ran to keep pace with her 
friend. They proceeded quietly to the street corner, speaking only to 
say their goodbyes and turn away from each other. Yoruichi didn&#39;t give 
the freshman a second thought until she heard a snapping sound behind 
her followed by &quot;Oh, damnit!&quot; Upon turning around, she saw Soi running 
in the street, chasing after what looked like the wind-wrecked remains 
of a black umbrella. After a few minutes in which she was completely 
soaked to the bone, Soi gave an angry huff and abandoned the attempt to 
catch her now-useless weather shield, then to Yoruichi&#39;s bewilderment 
continued on her way home. Yoruichi stared at her forlorn companion for 
a few minutes before she started running in Soi&#39;s direction.

Damnit...

Soi walked at a steady pace as the merciless elements continued to beat 
down on her, knowing that her house was too far away to bother with 
running. She silently cursed the wind that had carried her umbrella 
away, but not as much as the cold rain that was making her shiver so 
badly that she clutched her own shoulders in an attempt to keep warm. 
She was so focused on how miserable she was that she barely noticed 
Yoruichi until she felt a strong hand grab her by the shoulder and into 
the shelter of a red umbrella.

&quot;Y-Yoruichi-san?&quot; The freshman asked in surprise to the last person she 
expected to be here right now. &quot;What are you--&quot;

&quot;...Now you didn&#39;t think that I would let you walk all the way home in 
this crappy weather like that, did you?&quot; The older girl asked with a 
smile. &quot;Here, try and stay under the umbrella--you&#39;ll get sick if you 
get any wetter.&quot; Soi began to protest, but when she noticed that 
Yoruichi&#39;s arm was still wrapped around her in an effort to keep her 
from falling outside the the circumference of the umbrella, she felt any 
complaints she could have had leave her. Instead, she quietly allowed 
Yoruichi to shelter her, gradually becoming aware of just how warm the 
other girl was.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; Yoruichi said after a little while (even though it 
had been over 25 minutes, it seemed too short to Soi) when they arrived 
on the freshman&#39;s doorstep.

&quot;Uh...Thanks for walking me home,&quot; Soi blushed, suddenly aware of how 
what she&#39;d just said made it sound like they&#39;d been on a date, a concept 
that she felt oddly confused over.

&quot;Hey, no problem. Won&#39;t do you any good to get sick for your test, would 
you?&quot; The younger girl gave agreed with a nod of her head, then turned 
around to go inside when Yoruichi pulled on her sleeve. &quot;Oh, and here, 
take this--I hear it&#39;s supposed to rain again tomorrow.&quot; Soi blinked at 
Yoruichi&#39;s umbrella, handed out to her and packed into its original 
form. Before she could even refuse to the object, Yoruichi shoved it 
into her hand with a mischevious grin and dashed off, knowing that if 
she lingered then Soi would just try to give it back to her. For a few 
minutes Soi just stood on the somewhat dry step, watching as her friend 
became a very wet speck in the distance, then felt a smile creep onto 
her lips as she turned and went inside. Maybe the rain wasn&#39;t such a bad 
thing after all...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This time it was Soi&#39;s turn to worry. As she sat in class on Friday, she 
couldn&#39;t help but think about where Yoruichi was. She hadn&#39;t seen her 
the day after the big rainstorm, which had been on Tuesday, and had been 
conspicuously absent from classes for the rest of the week. She hadn&#39;t 
had a chance to ask Urahara about it, since he seemed to be either 
working or skipping class these days.

...Did something happen to her?

She knew that Yoruichi was more than capable of taking care of herself, 
but all the same she couldn&#39;t help but feel uneasy. On top of that, she 
would have felt better about the impending Karate test if her friend had 
been there.

Well, I guess I&#39;ll just have to go ahead and try...

Soi was heading for the exit when she heard a voice calling her name.

&quot;Hey, Soi Fong! Wait up!&quot; The Chinese girl looked down the hall to see a 
very recognizable redhead dashing towards her, coming to a stop a few 
feet away.

&quot;...Matsumoto-san?&quot; the freshman asked, unable to conceal the surprise 
in her voice. It was one thing for Yoruichi to look for her, but for 
someone she barely knew like Rangiku to seek the petite girl out seemed 
quite out of the ordinary. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Oh, good, I&#39;m glad I found you! You&#39;re Yoruichi-san&#39;s friend, right?&quot;

&quot;W-well, yeah...&quot; Soi answered uncertainly, her gut telling her that 
Rangiku was looking for a favor.

&quot;Finally!&quot; the well-endowed woman breathed a sigh of relief as she 
handed a two-inch thick stack of papers to Soi Fong, who took them with 
wide eyes. &quot;I was getting really desperate; I&#39;m so glad I ran into you!&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait! What the hell is all thi--&quot; Soi began but Matsumoto 
hurriedly interrupted her.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry to do this, but I&#39;m in Yoruichi&#39;s homeroom class, see, 
and the teacher asked me to give these to her since she&#39;s been absent 
but I don&#39;t know where she lives and I haven&#39;t been able to find anyone 
who knows where her house is and so if you could give these to her then 
I&#39;d really appreciate it!&quot; Soi blinked, uncertain she had understood 
anything the senior had said to her; she was speaking at a mile a minute 
and her brain was struggling to catch up.

&quot;H-hold on a minute! What makes you think that I know where she--&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot; Rangiku said distractedly as she glanced at her watch. 
&quot;...But I really need to get going! Sorry about this; I&#39;ll make it up to 
you I swear!&quot;

&quot;But I--&quot; Soi started to argue, but Matsumoto had already ran down the 
hallway and out the exit, rushing to wherever it was that she needed to 
be so quickly. The freshman stared at the ream of missives and homework 
that had, as of now, been passed down to her.

&quot;...How the hell am I supposed to know where she lives?&quot; Deciding that 
sitting here wasting time would get her nowhere, she gave a sigh and 
decided to start by asking the records office.
