The next few weeks passed without incident. Soi got over her sickness 
fairly quickly even without Yoruichi&#39;s help, though the older girl 
occasionally called to make sure her friend wanted for nothing. 
Conversations passed easily, though they bore an almost forced degree of 
pleasantness, and soon enough school had started again. Soi never 
bothered to ask, but it seemed as though Yoruichi&#39;s schedule for this 
semester seemed even busier, as if she was avoiding her, but decided not 
to bring it up on the rare occasions that they were in each other&#39;s 
company.

February 11th happened to be one of those days. Her morning classes 
over, Soi Fong had taken her lunch to the roof, half-hoping that the 
upperclassman would be there already, even if she was with Kisuke or 
Kuukaku. No one present, the freshman gave the slightest grimace of 
disappointment before sitting on the chill concrete below her feet, 
wishing she&#39;d had the foresight to wear her coat but not cold enough to 
remedy the situation. She smiled as she unwrapped the hastily-made bento 
her father had insisted on packing for her today, taking out small card 
and silently thanking him for never once forgetting no matter how busy 
he was.

&quot;Hey, kid! Wat&#39;cha up to?&quot; At the sound of Kuukaku&#39;s voice Soi 
instinctively stuffed the note back into her lunchbox; since the lid had 
partly concealed it she hoped that the upperclassman hadn&#39;t noticed. 
Looking up to see her accompanied by Yoruichi, who flashed the most 
benign of grins before sitting on her opposite side, made her doubly 
hopeful.

&quot;H-hi Kuukaku...Yoruichi-san...&quot; The dark-skinned woman gave a grunt of 
acknowledgement before immediately digging into her meal; Soi caught the 
slightest flash of seaweed-wrapped sushi before her friend swallowed it 
in a single gulp.

&quot;Geez, how come I never get spoken to with respect like that?&quot; Kuukaku 
complained aloud, seemingly to no one. &quot;...It&#39;s like everyone just 
thinks I don&#39;t deserve it!&quot;

&quot;...You don&#39;t,&quot; Yoruichi quipped out of nowhere; not even the uneasiness 
between her and Soi Fong had damaged her razor-sharp instincts when it 
came to sarcasm.

&quot;Oh, is that it? An&#39; I suppose you&#39;re a regular sain--&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

Soi felt her eyes widen when she realized what Yoruichi had asked about, 
aware that when she&#39;d reopened her lunch she&#39;d forgotten to shift the 
note to the side, out of plain sight where it now sat.

&quot;N-nothing--Hey!&quot; the freshman protested as the curious Yoruichi 
snatched the note with lightening speed, grinning mischeivously as she 
turned the paper over to read it. Her smile dropped in less than a 
second when she realized what it said, written hastily in a rather 
cramped handwriting.

Happy birthday to my &#39;Little Bee.&#39; Sorry to let you know like this, but 
I had to cancel our plans for tonight. Will make it up to you later! - 
Love, Dad

She hadn&#39;t finished a second before Soi grabbed it back from her, 
folding it into her pocket and gathering her things quickly to leave. 
The freshman had nearly reached the door when Yoruichi stopped her with 
another question.

&quot;...Today&#39;s your birthday?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Soi answered quietly, as if ashamed of the fact.

&quot;What?! Why didn&#39;t you tell us?!&quot; the eldest Shiba asked with a 
bewildered expression. &quot;We coulda put together a party for ya or 
somethin&#39;!&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s not that big a deal-- it&#39;s just like any other day.&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Yoruichi finally spoke up, brow furrowed slightly in 
annoyance. &quot;Of course it&#39;s important! I can pretty easily say that you 
wouldn&#39;t be here if it wasn&#39;t for your birthday!&quot; At that Soi&#39;s stoic 
expression cracked slightly, and the faintest of smiles flickered across 
her lips at the jest. Yoruichi felt herself smile back, relieved that 
she&#39;d stopped her friend&#39;s attempt at running out for now. &quot;So...what&#39;s 
this business about &#39;plans with your dad?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Not much. It&#39;s just that he takes me out to dinner on my birthday every 
year, but he&#39;s working late tonight on this case of his and he can&#39;t get 
away, so...&quot; She trailed off and gave a nonchalant shrug, but there was 
something in Soi&#39;s attitude that gave away her disappointment. Before 
she could say anything, Kuukaku beat her to the punch.

&quot;Hey! Why don&#39;t we all go out for your birthday? You know-- make it a 
girl&#39;s night out.&quot;

&quot;...Oh no, it&#39;s no big deal...&quot;

&quot;Come on, Soi,&quot; Yoruichi interjected, enthusiastic at the chance to 
reassert her friendship with the younger girl, &quot;...It&#39;s our treat! I 
think that&#39;s the LEAST you should let us do for acting like we weren&#39;t 
allowed to find out.&quot; Soi didn&#39;t answer right away, but in spite of her 
response the unexpected realization that she&#39;d be having a birthday 
party betrayed itself by the hint of red on her cheeks.

&quot;...I guess if you want to...&quot;

----------

Hours later Yoruichi stood in front of her bathroom mirror, suddenly 
wondering if she was getting overdressed. Her rather limited supply of 
cosmetics lay scattered and open on the finished marble counter, and 
while the upperclassman was heating the ends of her ponytail in a curler 
she considered a pair of outfits she&#39;d narrowed her selection down to. 
At this point it had come down to a casual dress skirt paired with a 
matching black v-neck and denim jacket or a jet-black ribbed turtleneck 
and stone-washed blue jeans. It was a decision she&#39;d have made in less 
than a second any other time she went out, but the fact that it was for 
Soi had made her a bit more careful. She&#39;d made a rule when it came to 
dressing up: anything that revealed cleavage was for a date, anything 
more conservative was for friends. Why she was even struggling with this 
decision made no sense to her, but even so her hand strayed toward the 
more provocative of the two.

What am I doing, Yoruichi wondered as she caught herself again, and 
released the holder of the curler to let her hair fall. It&#39;s not even 
like I&#39;m gonna be alone with Soi. It&#39;s just dinner and dancing at a 
nightclub. Besides, Kuukaku&#39;s gonna be there too.

&quot;I say go with the v-neck.&quot;

Yoruichi jumped, turned at the sound of her best friend&#39;s voice, 
casually drifting through the other side of the wide-open door, surprise 
turning quickly to frustration.

&quot;Goddamnit Kisuke, would it kill you to knock for once?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. Maybe if you made an effort to lock the front door more 
often...&quot; the blonde teased from the other side of the outside wall, 
taking the slightest of glances in before looking away. Yoruichi never 
bothered to wear a bra most of the time and though she didn&#39;t seem to 
care if anyone saw her, it was more of a personal effort of self-control 
on Kisuke&#39;s part to avoid staring. &quot;...Anyway, I put the keys on the 
kitchen table. You just needed the car for tonight, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, thanks. Are you sure you don&#39;t need me to give you a ride back 
home?&quot;

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s no big deal. A guy I know from work lives nearby; he said 
it&#39;d be fine.&quot; Yoruichi gave a slight grunt of comprehension before 
going about brushing her teeth for the third time, and it was moments 
before she finished that Kisuke caught a familiar scent coming from the 
bathroom. &quot;...Rose perfume?&quot; He heard the sound of choking on 
toothpaste, followed by the rapid activation of the faucet and the sound 
of post-gargling gasps for breath.

&quot;S-so what?&quot; Yoruichi growled once she&#39;d recovered. &quot;...I like this 
stuff.&quot;

&quot;We both know the only time you ever wear that is when you go on a 
date.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s NOT a date! Me and KUUKAKU are taking Soi out for her birthday, 
that&#39;s it!&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well if that&#39;s the case, forgive me for making such an assumption,&quot; 
Urahara said simply. While Yoruichi was glad he&#39;d dropped the subject, 
the way he spoke bothered her, as if he knew something she didn&#39;t. She 
put her toothbrush back in the porcelin mug by the mirror just as the 
phone in the next-door bedroom rung. Yoruichi picked it up, smiling when 
she heard Kuukaku on the line.

&quot;Hey! Sorry, I&#39;m just getting dressed and then I&#39;ll pick you up, okay?&quot;

&quot;...Yoruichi, I can&#39;t come.&quot; The bronzed teen felt her face drop at the 
other girl&#39;s words, brain instantly struggling to find a way around the 
situation.

&quot;W-what do you mean? This was your idea-- I thought you were open 
tonight!&quot;

&quot;I was, but...something came up, and I&#39;m busy. You can take her, right? 
I told you the directions, so...&quot;

&quot;...Wait a minute!&quot; Yoruichi hollered, suspicion at her friend&#39;s flimsy 
excuse catching up to her. &quot;Just tell me why you can&#39;t make i--&quot; she 
caught the quickest utterance of &#39;bye&#39; she&#39;d ever heard before Kuukaku 
hung up, leaving the dial tone to hum in Yoruichi&#39;s ear.

&quot;...Who was that?&quot; Urahara called once he heard footsteps moving back 
into the bathroom.

&quot;...Kuukaku ditched on me,&quot; Yoruichi grumbled, biting her lip slightly 
as the realization she&#39;d be alone with Soi for the whole evening hit 
her. She could call the freshman. Tell her they&#39;d reschedule; it wasn&#39;t 
like Soi would verbally protest. But at the same time she knew she 
couldn&#39;t do that-- she could tell Soi was happy at the very notion of 
celebrating with her friends. Well...friend. Just a friend.

&quot;...So is it a date now?&quot;

In a rare instance, Yoruichi had no response to her friend&#39;s incessant 
teasing. Instead she hastily grabbed the turtleneck and jeans, 
unslipping the pants from their hangar.

Definitely this one, she told herself as her field of vision was 
obscured by black cotton.</pre>
