<h1>You Weren't Like the Others</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bleach/index.html">Bleach</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/roxius.html">Roxius</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Nemu wasn&#39;t like other girls. She didn&#39;t fuss over clothes or looks. She 
didn&#39;t drool over boys like the girls she&#39;s read about. Nemu doesn&#39;t 
seem to like or hate anything. What with her abusive father and the fact 
that she&#39;s not really human, Nemu can be considered to barely be a 
human. But that isn&#39;t what Yachiru thinks. 

Yachiru had never really cared if someone was gay or not. In fact, she 
was delighted to hear the news that Soi Fong and Yoruichi were lovers. 
When Yachiru saw Nemu for the first time, the little pink-haired girl 
realized that she was gay. 

She loved how beautiful Nemu always looked, no matter what she was 
wearing. She loved how Nemu had soft shiny hair and cute black eyes. 
Yachiru hated herself for loving Nemu, but she couldn&#39;t help it. 

Nemu was so beautiful...

Yachiru sighed and sat down near the small pond outside Mayuri&#39;s house. 
&#39;I wish I could tell Nemu how I feel...&#39; she thought. Suddenly, a voice 
said, &quot;Yachiru-kun, what are you doing?&quot; Yachiru spun around and saw 
Nemu walking towards her. Yachiru tried to keep herself from blushing 
when she saw Nemu smile. 

Nemu sat down next to Yachiru and asked, &quot;Are you okay? You 
look...hot...&quot; Yachiru&#39;s blushing got even worse when Nemu said that. 
Nemu put her hand on Yachiru&#39;s head and muttered, &quot;Hmm...your 
temperature is normal...&quot; Yachiru took a big gulp and thought, &#39;It&#39;s now 
or never...&#39; Suddenly, just as Yachiru was about to kiss Nemu, a voice 
shouted, &quot;YACHIRU, WAKE UP!&quot; 

Yachiru woke up and found herself in her bed. Zaraki was glared down at 
her. &quot;Come on, Yachiru! We got work today!&quot; Said the spikey-haired man 
as he left the room. Yachiru sighed and thought, &#39;Damn...I was so close 
too...&#39;
