The blonde passed his menu to the waiter, who smiled curtly as he 
scribbled on his notepad, changing Yoruichi&#39;s soup to a salad as she&#39;d 
requested.

&quot;Well... I hope this place is as good as I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Kisuke told his 
date with a valiant attempt at a lighthearted grin.

&quot;Yeah, but most likely there&#39;s just a fry cook from some lousy burger 
pit sittin&#39; in the kitchen.&quot; Urahara chuckled along with Yoruichi at her 
comment, almost convinced that they&#39;d broken the ice at last until she 
immediately went back to surveying their admittedly opulent 
surroundings, her golden eyes focusing on a Van Gogh hanging on the far 
wall as if trying to assess its authenticity.

Kisuke thought it rather ironic that in spite of their new status as a 
&#39;couple&#39; and Yoruichi&#39;s rather forward displays of &#39;affection&#39; when they 
were in school, now that no one they knew was around she had situated 
herself across from him at the table, ignoring his chivalrous attempt to 
pull out her chair, and apart from her recent observation hadn&#39;t really 
spoken for the duration of the evening. She did her best to appear alert 
and interested in the present but every so often her eyes would cloud 
over ever-so-slightly, her fingers fumbling absentmindedly with the 
array of silverware before her or the gold zigzag bracelet dangling from 
her left wrist.

She&#39;d never been so distant before all this, taking a seat beside him 
without thought wherever they happened to be, joking and teasing 
whenever she opened that surprisingly delicate mouth of hers. But then, 
it would have been foolish for him to think that with things being how 
they were Yoruichi would have displayed the same characteristics she 
always had.

&quot;So... I was wondering how you thought the test went today in Current 
Events--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Yoruichi interrupted as she put her cloth napkin 
on the table and slid out of her seat, headed for the restroom. &quot;Don&#39;t 
start if they bring our food, okay?&quot; Kisuke nodded, glancing at his 
lifelong companion as she walked away, the hem of her red dress swaying 
in time with her movements.

Kisuke wondered, as he slid a finger lazily across the rim of his water 
glass, what they were doing here. Not even simply the question of this 
particular restaurant, when he knew they both felt uncomfortable with 
places that expected a formal dress-code, but more what she was doing 
here with HIM, how they&#39;d ended up like this-- so far from the fantasy 
of her happily clinging to him, devoted to him like a little lost puppy 
that he&#39;d harbored somewhere in the back of his mind for the greater 
part of his adolescent life.

By the time Yoruichi returned she looked slightly disappointed to find 
that only the salads had arrived, as though she&#39;d been counting on the 
superstition that your meal appeared faster when you went to the 
bathroom. She slid back into her seat, giving her date a hint of a smile 
as she eyed the twin plates of assorted greenery topped liberally with 
tomato and squash.

&quot;Hey, nice to see you showed some restraint.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Kisuke asked skeptically. &quot;I don&#39;t seem to recall you showing any 
at my birthday last year. Kuukaku was fuming about you the entire next 
day for having to go out and find another cake at the last second.&quot; A 
smile flashed on Yoruichi&#39;s face at the reminiscence, chuckling about 
how little he&#39;d changed in a year while her hands went about cutting the 
lettuce into smaller bites.

&quot;And don&#39;t even get me started on when we all went out and you ate half 
the pizza--&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay! Jeez, you make me sound like some sort of p--&quot; Yoruichi 
stopped as she glanced down at her plate, realizing that she&#39;d cut her 
salad up too small, the leaves and tomato chunks less than a coin&#39;s 
diameter in size. When had she ever done that, the young woman wondered 
quietly to herself. The only person she&#39;d ever met that would eat like 
that, so meticulously and carefully was...

&quot;...You okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Yoruichi managed as she forced the pang of guilt away, smiling a 
bit too wide as she did so, &quot;...Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Kisuke didn&#39;t ask 
anything else as they ate in silence, which suited Yoruichi fine; the 
bubble of apprehension that had welled up in her stomach was making it 
rather difficult to enjoy her meal as it was.

----------

Keep breathing, Soi told herself as she walked up the stairs to get to 
her next set of classes, a small stack of her heavier textbooks cradled 
precariously under her arm. And though it was indeed a challenge for the 
already skinny girl to manage the weight, her efforts to focus herself 
had nothing to do with the task at hand. Yoruichi had often crossed 
paths with her on this staircase, so after the hammer had fallen she&#39;d 
avoided it on purpose. But due to congestion in the other stairwell and 
losing a few of her precious minutes to a forgotten notebook, the 
freshman had been faced with her deepest dread.

But no matter how much she cared about Yoruichi her father was right: 
she wasn&#39;t the only woman in the world, and more than that, there was no 
reason in the world for her to avoid Yoruichi. She&#39;d never shown any 
fear of Ichimaru when he&#39;d tried to control her, make her afraid and 
force her into a little box of terrible routine, and she wouldn&#39;t let 
Yoruichi have that sort of inhibiting influence on her now that it was 
over. She was so lost in her thoughts that she didn&#39;t notice the person 
coming down the stairs on the wrong side until they&#39;d collided, the 
students behind Soi brushing past her or cursing under their breaths as 
they hurried to class.

&quot;Oww... I&#39;m sorry, I-- Oh.&quot; The Chinese girl felt her voice catch as 
Yoruichi pulled herself up, looking equally surprised, as they hadn&#39;t 
spoken since Valentine&#39;s-- a little over two weeks prior, much less made 
an effort for direct contact.

&quot;...Hey,&quot; Yoruichi said quietly, her smile light and pleasant. Neutral. 
The shorter of the two nodded in response, but said nothing. It was 
harder to be focused when her senses were once again being assaulted by 
the girl she&#39;d so long adored, but she was thankful that at least her 
face wasn&#39;t giving anything away, although as a skill she&#39;d practiced 
most of her life this wasn&#39;t much of an accomplishment.

Wordlessly, the senior bent down and helped Soi gather up her things, 
readjusting her hold on her bookcase&#39;s handle when she felt it start to 
slip. The older girl didn&#39;t know why she felt so frustrated all of a 
sudden, or rather she didn&#39;t think that Soi failing to glance over at 
her, her face not burning red had anything to do with it. She was so 
used to being greeted with a nervous, almost-stammer of &#39;Yoruichi-san&#39; 
that to be treated by Soi like just another person felt strange.

&quot;So... how have you been?&quot;

Another surprise. Soi had initiated a conversation with HER, rather than 
the other way around, and though she wanted to believe there was a hint 
of silent longing buried in the younger girl&#39;s tone the fact was that 
she was speaking in a perfectly composed manner. As if they were a 
couple that had broken up long ago, but had somehow managed to get past 
it and be friends. Just friends. Again.

&quot;...I&#39;ve been all right. Kisuke and I spent the weekend together.&quot; 
Yoruichi didn&#39;t know WHY she said the last bit; it implied too much that 
hadn&#39;t actually occured. She hadn&#39;t slept with Kisuke yet, a feat that 
she normally would have done already save for something holding her back 
that she couldn&#39;t-- or wouldn&#39;t-- acknowledge. Even so, Yoruichi felt 
another tiny barb in her chest when Soi didn&#39;t seem affected by her 
rather suggestive insinuation, as if she&#39;d WANTED the girl to react 
negatively. To get jealous.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Soi muttered kindly as Yoruichi handed her the last of the 
books, sliding the whole stack back into the crook of her arm.

&quot;Do you need some help getting to class?&quot; Yoruichi asked, watching the 
freshman already begin to fight back through the crowd that she&#39;d, quite 
honestly, forgotten about.

&quot;No thanks. Bye, Shihouin-san!&quot; Soi smiled as she waved goodbye, 
disappearing into the second floor hallway. Once she knew she was out of 
Yoruichi&#39;s sight she let out the breath she&#39;d been holding, a slight 
feeling of exhileration clutching at her. She couldn&#39;t believe how easy 
that had been-- to just have a normal encounter with Yoruichi, without 
the feeling that the world was crashing down around her or that her 
heart would burst out of her chest. True, she did feel an ache still, 
but soon enough, she assured her self, even that would be gone 
eventually.

----------

&quot;There&#39;s the last of the whites,&quot; Kisuke declared as he put the 
detergent in the washer and hit the start button, closing the lid as 
water filled the base. &quot;...When was the last time you did laundry, 
anyway?&quot; Yoruichi chuckled, giving a shrug at the blonde&#39;s question; she 
honestly had forgotten about it over the last few weeks, as so much had 
been going on in that time. As such, she had accumulated a rather large 
mountain of used clothing, which wasn&#39;t much of a problem due to her 
rather liberal closet space.

&quot;Seriously, I know you don&#39;t like doing it, but I can&#39;t be here to help 
you out all the time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot; Yoruichi muttered, rolling her eyes just slightly at her 
companion&#39;s nagging. &quot;Of all the things you could be anal about, I don&#39;t 
know why it&#39;s this.&quot; Kisuke just smiled as he grabbed a basket full of 
clean clothes, thankful that none of Yoruichi&#39;s underwear was in the 
pile.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back to help you with the rest.&quot;

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Yoruichi insisted. &quot;...I&#39;m just gonna fold what came 
out of the dryer and then I&#39;ll be up, okay?&quot;

&quot;All right. Don&#39;t keep me waiting; the movie&#39;s gonna start in a 
half-hour.&quot; The dark-skinned girl waved him off as she began rifling 
through the dryer-warmed garments, making as little effort to ensuring 
that they were folded properly as she could. She&#39;d gotten halfway down 
the pile, grabbing the next white shirt that she could reach when she 
found it.

Soi&#39;s shirt-- the one she&#39;d worn the night of her father&#39;s accident, the 
white medium that was still too big for her, that had become mingled 
with her discarded turtleneck and the rest of their clothes-- was there 
in her hands, apparently forgotten by the young girl when she&#39;d left 
abruptly and neglected by the owner of the house. Yoruichi just stared 
at it for a moment, overwhelmed at what it reminded her of and 
struggling with the immediate desire to throw it away. She had to get 
rid of it-- it would look too awkward to give it back to Soi, especially 
after their encounter on the stairs. Yoruichi hadn&#39;t wanted to admit it, 
much less say it, but something about the way Soi had acted... like she 
really was over it... had left her feeling strangely empty, confused as 
the girl had walked away, if only slightly.

But this was what she&#39;d wanted, the upperclassman reminded herself. For 
Soi to get over her... wasn&#39;t it? And if it was, why did she get the 
sense that it was HER that had been abandoned, and not content that her 
efforts had succeeded? She didn&#39;t realize that she&#39;d been squeezing the 
shirt so hard until the slight prick of her fingernails registered on 
her palms through the fabric. She hadn&#39;t meant to, but it was still 
warm, so warm that...

Before she&#39;d realized what she was doing Yoruichi had pressed the 
garment to her face, the hem scrunched up in her left hand while she 
gently held it along the collar, her eyes sliding shut as she took in 
the scent of the soap that still clung to it, assaulted immediately by 
the aroma of clean linen. Of her.

It was such a simple, unspectacular scent, one she&#39;d never particularly 
noticed before but now it made Yoruichi tremble, made her breathe it out 
a little slower than she normally would have, as if her whole body had 
linked the aroma so irrevocably with Soi that it was reluctant to let it 
escape her lungs altogether. Yoruichi was beginning to think that Soi 
really was there, could almost swear she felt the contour of her 
shoulders and back between her arms, her warm breath along the back of 
her neck, whispering her name over and over in that voice that said she 
saw no one in the world but her. But it WAS just the shirt, and after a 
few reluctant moments her sanity returned, making her pull the clothing 
away as if she&#39;d been doing something abhorrent.

She immediately held the shirt over the nearby wastebasket, but instead 
of letting go she could swear her fingers simply gripped it tighter. A 
few minutes passed, in which the upperclassman stared at it, willing 
herself to relinquish it, to just let it go, to stop thinking about it 
once and for all. She nearly cursed aloud as she threw it into the 
basket with the clean clothes, burying it as she threw the rest of the 
load on top, doing her absolute best to ignore the fact that all her 
laundry had started to smell like Soi. Yoruichi vowed to at least stuff 
it in the back of her closet, hoping that without a visual cue she 
wouldn&#39;t keep getting this gradually powerful ache in the pit of her 
stomach.

----------

Urahara walked back up the stairs, not needing to be told what had 
caused such a strong reaction in Yoruichi, knowing that it was something 
she&#39;d obviously not wanted anyone to see. He said nothing as Yoruichi 
walked up the stairs with her clothes, pretending to be interested in 
the weather forecast on the TV even as he caught Yoruichi&#39;s surprisingly 
poor attempt to mask her inner turmoil.

This wasn&#39;t right for either of them, for anyone. It killed him to 
acknowledge that he was actually wanting to let Yoruichi go, the girl 
he&#39;d held a torch over for so long, but Kisuke knew that something had 
to be done.</pre>
