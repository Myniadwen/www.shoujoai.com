fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>If this is the first Idol Project fanfic ever to be written, go me! If 
not...well, I hope I can find these other IP fanfic writers and praise 
em! This series needs more love. XD

-

I feel at home on my stage more than anywhere else.

I sing, the words pouring from my lips like wine.

I dance, my body moving to the beat of the music.

I sing about a boy.

But in my heart, it is about a girl.

To a girl.

My pretty girl.

She stands in the audience, her entire body sparkling with awe and 
wonder. But she also looks nervous, as one would in the presence of a 
star.

There are millions in my audience. But as I continue to sing and sway, 
my eyes lock with hers. She blushes, and I smile and wink at her.

It is a routine we have settled into, whether onstage or elsewhere. Our 
eyes lock. She blushes. I flirt with her. She blushes even harder and 
backs away.

Perhaps I come on too strong? A girl like her needs to be handled with 
care, after all.

On the other hand, she is so adorable when she&#39;s being shy!

I finish my song with the usual flourish, blowing kisses to the 
audience. As always, the last one is directed at her.

After the curtain falls, I head backstage, and to my surprise, she is 
waiting there.

&quot;Miss Corvette!&quot;

&quot;Oh! Mimu-chan!&quot; I gasp. &quot;What a pleasant surprise!&quot;

&quot;You were wonderful,&quot; she says. &quot;You always are, though.&quot;

I draw her into my arms. She gives her usual squeak of surprise, and I 
place a fingertip to her lips.

&quot;How can I be anything less when my pretty girl is in the audience?&quot;

She blushes brightly, but does not try to get away this time.

I take advantage of her silence and kiss her.

-End-

Corvette is FUN...I definitely have to write her more often. XD</pre>
