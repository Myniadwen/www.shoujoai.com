<h1>All's Fair in Love and Servbots</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../megaman/index.html">Megaman</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/genro.html">Genro</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Denise sat struggling in the storage area of the Gesselscheft looking 
very worse for ware. Her clothes were singed and she looked beat up in 
general. She felt utterly miserable that not only had she been beaten 
by that stupid space pirate again, she was taken captive! 

Suddenly she heard a voice from outside the storage area. 

&quot;So this is where you brought her hmm?&quot; sounded the first voice. 

&quot;Yes miss Tron!&quot; a second voice sounded. 

Suddenly the door flew open and standing there was Tron and 2 of her 
Servbots. 

&quot;Hey! I&#39;m not a piece of treasure ya know! You can&#39;t just stick in 
here like a box of stolen goods!&quot; she yelled out automatically without 
thinking of the consequences. 

Tron just laughed in reply. 

&quot;Ooooo you got spunk. I guess that was evident by how you constantly 
kept after me even though you knew you couldn&#39;t win against my perfect 
Gustaff.&quot; Tron said with an air of royalty to her voice. 

This just caused Denise to break down crying. 

&quot;Its not fair! Why do bad things keep happening to me! The chief is 
really angry at me! She&#39;ll probably fire me soon! If I can&#39;t keep a 
job how am I ever going to get a boyfriend!&quot; she yelled between 
sobbed. 

Tron just stared at her with an odd look. 

&quot;Hmm you shouldn&#39;t worry......&quot; she said laughing lightly and leaning 
down towards her &quot;A cute girl like you could easily get a boyfriend 
even without a really successful job. I mean not every girl is blessed 
as I am&quot; she said with another laugh. 

&quot;C&#39;mon 8 and 7 we better get out of here before the police come 
looking for her.&quot; 

&quot;Yes miss Tron!&quot; they cried in unison. The door immediately slammed 
shut afterwards. 

This just left Denise sitting there half crying and half blushing. Not 
knowing what the heck had just happened. She knew that Tron wasn&#39;t 
such a bad person when she had encouraged her....but....there seemed 
to be even something more. She couldn&#39;t place her finger on it...but 
there was a funny feeling inside of her chest....... 

She suddenly gripped her fists and decided she would figure out out ot 
get out of here and then worry about her emotions. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Denise struggled a little with her bonds desperately trying to free 
herself of them, when the doors to the storage room suddenly swung 
open again and in walked a Servbot wearing a smok. 

&quot;Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?&quot; she yelled as the Servbot started 
to dust her. 

&quot;Miss Tron told me to make sure everything in the storage area was to 
be kept clean.&quot; he promplty replied. 

Suddenly Denise got a sly look. 

&quot;Ya know....I believed Tron wanted you to let me out of these bonds.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm? I don&#39;t know....I don&#39;t remember Miss Tron asking me that..&quot; 

&quot;Oh c&#39;mon....I remember her saying it. You don&#39;t want to make her mad 
now do you?&quot; 

The servbot seemed to panic for a moment. 

&quot;N..no....!&quot; he exclaimed as he quickly undid her ropes. 

She jumped up suddenly the second she was free, knocking the Servbot 
off its feet. 

&quot;Yes! I did it! Now I can prove to the chief how valuable I am. By 
bringing Tron Bonne into custody!&quot; she exclaimed, then charged out of 
the room. 

The servbot slowly got to its feet and looked out to where she had ran 
to. 

&quot;Uh oh.....I think I made a boo boo. Miss Tron will be mad at me....&quot; 
he said to himself with watery eyes. 

Meanwhile Tron was sitting in her room trying to think of what she 
should attack next for some money. 

&quot;I guess I could....&quot; 

Suddenly from outside her door she heard a THUD followed by someone 
exclaiming &quot;Darn high heels!&quot; 

She got up from her bed to inspect who it was. And when she peeked out 
of the room, she saw Denise lying there looking embarrased. 

&quot;Hey! How did you get out!&quot; she demanded. 

&quot;Well I uh....I uh.....umm....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Tron stood there staring down at Denise looking furious. 

&quot;Well out with it already!&quot; she yelled. 

Denise sat there on the ground looking flustered when suddenly she 
jumped to her feet, feeling a burst of confidence. 

&quot;I escaped so I could put you under arrest Tron Bo....&quot; 

&quot;Me! You came to arrest me?!&quot; she interrupted laughing. 

Denise quickly blushed and looked down, losing her confidence again. 

&quot;Well I uh....yeah sorta.&quot; she looked up again. &quot;So if you&#39;ll come 
along quietly then maybe I...&quot; 

Tron didn&#39;t let her finish as she led her into her room. 

&quot;I think I have to explain a few things to you....Denise.&quot; 

&quot;Explain...well I....ok&quot; she just nodded being led into the room. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Denise felt herself being dragged into Tron&#39;s room, but what surprised 
her when she got inside it was actually quite nice. Actually it looked 
sorta like her bedroom.....minus the servbots....luxurious 
bed....expensive furniture. Well now that she thought of it, it looked 
nothing like her room, but it did give her sorta a deja vu feeling for 
some reason. 

Tron sat her down on the bed and then paced back in forth in front of 
her, giving her occasional glances. Denise just stared at her with 
curious eyes as she tried to determine why Tron was being so nice to 
her. 

&quot;Denise....Denise Marmalade. Right?&quot; Tron said finally speaking up. 

&quot;Y...yes. How did you know my last name?&quot; Denise replied confused. 

&quot;Let me ask you a question first. As a kid had you ever been to a big 
mansion in Golden City?&quot; Tron asked looming over her slightly. 

Denise looked at her strangely, then got a thoughtful look on her 
face. 

&quot;Well actually yes....my uncle worked there as a butler, he used to 
let my family visit him. I used to go there all the time. Hey 
now....how did you know that!?&quot; Denise demanded standing up, sorta 
being freaked out. 

Tron just stood there calmly with her arms crossed. 

&quot;And do you remember anything about the mansion like the people who 
lived there?&quot; Tron retorted, taking no notice to Denise&#39;s surprise. 

&quot;What do you mean? Yeah there was a girl, and I.....&quot; she stopped mid 
sentence as she gasped, pointing at Tron. 

&quot;You...you...you. Its you!!!&quot; she yelled totally surprised. 

&quot;Your hair is even the same. The way you talk, everything. I can&#39;t 
believe I didn&#39;t realize it. Now I understand. I understand why you 
treated me like you knew me during those bank roberies.&quot; Denise 
thougth to herself as she reminised on the past. 

Suddenly Denise stared at Tron angerly. 

&quot;Hey you were rich. Why are you robbing all those banks!&quot; she 
demanded. 

Tron just sighed. 

&quot;Nice to see you again to Denise. Geez.....as for your question. Its a 
loooooong story.&quot; she grumbled. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Denise listened as Tron slowly went through the entire story. How her 
brothers were captured by Loath, and how she was trying to get the 
cash to pay for their bail. 

Denise sat there all the while getting teary eyed as she listend. 

&quot;Thats....sniff.....so noble!&quot; she cried and suddenly clung onto Tron. 

&quot;Gahhh! Get offa me!&quot; she yelled trying to wrench her off, her face 
beat red the entire time. 

Denise let go a few moments later blushing. 

&quot;Oh...I&#39;m sorry, I sorta got carried away with myself.&quot; she said with 
a sweatdrop. Suddenly though Denise got serious. 

&quot;In honor of all you did for me as a kid, I&#39;ll carry out my officer&#39;s 
duty and help you Tron get your brothers back.&quot; she said with a quite 
serious tone. 

Tron blinked for a few moments. 

&quot;You really don&#39;t remember how it was when we were kids.&quot; Tron thought 
as she remembered how she used to always boss Denise around. 

Denise suddenly clamped on Tron again. 

&quot;It will be just like old times right Tron?!&quot; she said through sobs. 

&quot;yeah.....just...like....old........times....eck.....&quot; Tron grumbled 
while she patted Denise on the back. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hey wake up!!&quot; 

Denise fell out of bed with a thump as she heard the voice of none 
other then Tron right in here ear. Denise layed on the ground for 
several seconds as she rubbed her sore back. 

&quot;Ow! Hey what was that for?&quot; she whined standing up and sitting on her 
bed. 

&quot;We have a lot of work to do today. We&#39;ve almost made 1 millions 
zenny. This last mission should send us to our goal!&quot; Tron beamed as 
she stood there with a proud smile. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Denise suddenly remembered all that had happened. She had decided to 
work with Tron to get her brothers back a few weeks ago. The funny 
thing though is that she never questioned what drove her to brake the 
law to gain money....especially for Tron. Suddenly the question seemed 
to be the only thing she could think about at the moment, and she just 
had to ask. 

&quot;Hey Tron, I was...&quot; 

&quot;Denise, why are you helping me?&quot; Tron interrupted her. 

Denise was taken abake by Tron&#39;s sudden question, as well as the fact 
that Tron was now sitting next to her. 

&quot;Uh...well I don&#39;t really know. Actually I&#39;ve never really thought 
about it until now.&quot; she said with a thoughtful look on her face. 

Tron leaned over to Denise a bit. 

&quot;Hey Denise remember when we were kids. That time by the fountain?&quot; 

Denise stared at her for a few moments, then once again got the 
thoughtful look on her face. 

&quot;Oh yeah I remember!&quot; she exclaimed as she thought back. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Tron and Denise were together on the terrace outside of Tron&#39;s 
mansion. They must of been only about 6 at the time. Denise was 
walking unsteadily back and forth along the terrace, the reason being 
she had a blindfold on. 

&quot;Cmon Denise! This is how you play tag, now you better catch me or 
you&#39;ll have to be it forever!&quot; Tron yelled with a smirk. It was always 
easy to fool Denise. 

&quot;Uhhh Tron....I can&#39;t see though. I don&#39;t even know where you are.&quot; 
she whined as she wandered around. 

&quot;Oh c&#39;mon Denise just walk towards the sound of...my....Hey watch 
out!&quot; she suddenly yelled as Denise wandered to close to the railing 
and suddenly fell over. 

Tron screamed as she ran over ot the edge. 

&quot;Oh my gosh! Denise!&quot; she yelled half crying. 

Luckily the terrace was only a few feet above the lawn below. But 
never the less Denise had taken quite a fall and she was lying on the 
ground below crying, a small bump on her head, the blindfold still 
over her eyes. 

Tron quickly ran down and helped Denise up. 

&quot;Oh my gosh, Denise are you alright!&quot; Tron whimpered as she shook her 
gently. 

Denise didn&#39;t even answer between her sobs. 

Tron immediately took off her blindfold and looked into her eyes. 

&quot;Denise! Are you ok? I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; she asked her own eyes filled with 
tears. 

&quot;It hurts Tron....&quot; she whimpered lightly. 

Tron then leaned up and gently kissed her on the forehead where the 
bump was then wiped away a few of her tears. 

&quot;There....does it feel a bit better now?&quot; she asked with a small 
smile. 

Denise whimpered a few more moments, then she lightly smiled. 

&quot;Yes....thank you...Tron. I love you.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Denise was violently shook out of her memory when she remembered that 
last part. She was blushing violently, and felt so embarrased since 
she knew Tron must of remembered that part to. 

&quot;Ack! I&#39;m sorry! We were just kids! I didn&#39;t know what I was saying!&quot; 
she yelled out feeling so embarrased. She realized though at that 
moment that it wasn&#39;t from just the memory that she was 
embarrased...it was that she thought it may still be true today. She 
sat there for a few moments looking down, her face beet red. 

Suddenly Tron pushed her gently. 

&quot;Your so funny Denise!&quot; Tron said happily. 

&quot;Tron...I uhh....I&#39;m so...sorr.....&quot; 

She was broken off as Tron suddenly kissed her. Denise finally noticed 
that postion she was in, Tron had pushed her down on the bed and now 
was partially on top of her kissing her. Her head swam with emotions 
as all over this seemed so right. But just as soon as the kiss had 
started it was over, and Tron was staring at her. Her own face a light 
shade of red. 

&quot;Denise....I didn&#39;t understand why you wanted to help me. But then I 
remembered that moment. And I remembered......do you remember what I 
said on that day?&quot; she softly said. 

Denise shook her head with an &quot;uh uh&quot;. 

&quot;I love you to Denise.&quot; Tron whispered, as she leaned down and kissed 
Denise again. 

------------------------------------------------------------

((Well how do you like it peoples. It seemed rushed because it was. 
This originally wasn&#39;t even supposed to be a fanfic, it was orginally 
just to give someone else who was writing a Denise/Tron fanfic some 
ideas. Though he kept asking for more so I kept on writing. And what 
you see here is the finished product. Now I&#39;m not sure if I should go 
on from this point, cuz everything after this would be a lemon. But I 
guess if I get enough enthusiasm about it, I&#39;ll continue with a lemon 
chapter. Well I hoped you all liked it, this is Genro signing off)
