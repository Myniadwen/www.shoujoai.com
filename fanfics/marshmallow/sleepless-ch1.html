<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  italicized paragraphs represent Ana’s thoughts. I’m sure you could have  figured that out yourselves, but I like to cover all my bases. Anyway,  this is my first fan fiction, and frankly I think it shows, so I more  than welcome any advice and/or criticism you may have to offer. After  all, how can I expect to grow as a writer if I don’t know what to  improve on?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, I should probably wrap this up before I start to ramble. Enjoy!</span></p>

The  nearby alarm clock ticked away the seconds of the late evening as Ana  Coppola lay in her bed, unable to fall asleep. After accepting defeat  in something resembling a vigorous staring contest with the ceiling,  the petite Brit glanced toward her bedside table to check the time. Two  o’clock in the morning. She turned to her side to watch her friend,  Matsuri Sakuragi, sleeping soundly beside her. Slowly breathing in and  out, her chest rising and falling with each calm breath, Matsuri blew  breezes of warm air toward Ana.<br />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><br />
</span></strong><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seems so serene right now. I guess Matsuri is the sort of  person who is most at ease when she’s asleep. Then again, with  everything we did today it really shouldn’t surprise me that she’s  sleeping like this. Matsuri does get worn out fairly easily. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Honestly,  when I invited Matsuri over this afternoon, I wasn’t really planning on  her staying for the night. My original plan was to study a new English  workbook, but then mother asked if we wanted to go shopping. After  that, she took us to a family restaurant for a bite to eat. When we  finally got back, rather than returning to our studies, we decided to  watch a movie instead. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We completely lost track of the  time, so father offered to let Matsuri stay over. That way she wouldn’t  have to walk home. Not that it bothers me or anything. Matsuri is good  company. She’s polite and courteous, plus my parents absolutely adore  her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Placing her arms underneath her pillow, Matsuri sighed  as she blearily repositioned herself. Ana quickly squeezed her eyes  shut and pretended to sleep. After a moment or two, Ana opened her eyes  to see if Matsuri was sleeping. As soon as she did, though, Ana was  forced to bury her face into a pillow to cover up her uncontrollable  giggle-fit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In Matsuri’s nighttime spasm, stray strands of pale  gray hair fell over the young girl’s face, completely covering her  eyes. Giggling to herself, Ana extended her hand across the bed. Slowly  and gently she brushed away the tresses from Matsuri’s face, taking  extra precaution so as to not wake her playmate. Content with every  hair back in its proper place, Ana clasped her hands together and  continued “Matsuri watching”.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If the others were here right  now I bet Miu would probably say, “How could you fritter away these  your precious days of youth by spending an entire day being boring and  unproductive?!” Or something along those lines at least.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  know something, Matsuri; we don’t get into nearly as many shenanigans  when it’s just you and I. In fact, when Miu isn’t around, my life is  much less hectic and episodic altogether. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That is not to  say that I hate Miu. Heavens no! I don’t believe any of us could say  that. But the girl would be much more bearable to be around if she just  learned to sit still once in a while.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I know a fair amount  of the annoying things Miu does are usually unintentional, but that  doesn’t make her actions any less irritating. That’s just the way she  is. Silly girl doesn’t know any better. She’s yet to learn the meaning  of “tact”! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I suppose you understand that all too well,  don’t you Matsuri? You’ve known Miu much longer than I have. Frankly,  I’m surprised you’ve put up with her for as long as you have. Poor  girl! Miu torments you so much! If it weren’t for Chika and Nobue I  can’t even imagine why you would even associate with someone who seems  to make it her life’s goal to see how much she can pester you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rolling  over, Ana checked the time on her alarm clock again. Needless to say,  it was still late and she wasn’t feeling any sleepier. So, she chose to  lie on her back and look up at the ceiling again. Perhaps, if she  stared into the darkness long enough she might succumb to boredom and  finally fall asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Still… once in a while, Miu does show  signs of something which resembles kindness and she’ll try to help  others out. In her own… Miu-ish way. You remember, don’t you Matsuri? A  few months ago Miu made it her mission to rehabilitate you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  not quite sure how it led to this, though. At the time I was trying to  read a book. So when Miu asked me about your daily rituals, (Which  usually consists of you habitually tripping and falling over, as well  as, frequent visits to the infirmary), I was a bit surprised, to say  the least. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I suppose Miu was too, because next thing I  knew she, and even Chika, became awfully concerned for your well being  and decided to “toughen you up,” in a manner of speaking. Miu wanted to  make sure you’d be able to function, even if we were to suddenly leave.  At first, I assumed it was just another of her harebrained schemes to  alleviate her boredom. Then, before I knew it, the whole thing turned  into a big production! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It wasn’t just you they worried  about either. I guess they felt that you might become too dependent on  me and feared that you would cause me unwanted stress. But, I don’t  consider you to be stress inducing at all. You’re my friend. Why should  I be upset because you take things a little slower than most people? In  fact, I like that about you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Frankly, I never felt like  there was anything wrong with you, anyway! True, you are clumsier and  more naive than most people… I never saw any cause for concern, though.  People are usually uncoordinated when they’re younger, aren’t they?  Over time, they grow out of it. You’re just a late bloomer, Matsuri.  That’s what I always believed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Besides, if either of us  should be accused of being dependent of the other, it’s me. After all,  I’m the fool who decided to go to school and pretend to be fluent in a  language I cannot even speak. When you first found out my secret I was  so afraid that you would tell someone or make fun of me, but you  didn’t. Instead, you were too distracted by a grain of rice on my cheek  that it didn’t even occur to you that I spoke fluent Japanese. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Frustrated  as I was back then, thinking about it now, I am extremely fortunate  that I met you that day. Not only did you keep my secret, but you even  went so far as to help me try and relearn English. To say you’re  dependent of me… without you, I wouldn’t even be able to communicate  with anyone at school because of the situation I put myself in. I never  would have gotten to know Chika, Nobue, and, yes, even Miu, had I not  met you, Matsuri. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>People say you’re a wimp, a weakling,  who’d be completely lost if I wasn’t there to hold your hand. Even  Chika and the others think that you’re a burden to me. But I like being  with you. When you fall down I don’t give you my hand out of pity. I  don’t help you swim laps in the pool or sit by your side in the  infirmary because I feel obligated to. I do it because I want to. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Apparently,  you’re school life would completely fall apart if I weren’t there. Then  the same is true of me. I truly don’t know what I would do if one of us  were to leave. If you’re really overly dependent of me, then I’m  equally dependent of you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Matsuri, you are my best friend! When I’m with you I feel warm inside… I feel truly, truly happy. Overjoyed, even!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Without  warning, Ana’s thoughts were abruptly interrupted by noises emanating  from Matsuri’s side of the bed. Sounds of something resembling a  whimpering puppy grew more and more loudly. Using her left arm to prop  herself up, Ana sat up in her bed and leaned over to Matsuri.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  timid child buried her head into her pillow, attempting to hide her  streaming tears from Ana. The concerned blond laid her right hand on  Matsuri’s back. Despite shuddering at the touch of Ana’s small hand,  Matsuri still tried her best to keep quiet. Eventually, Matsuri’s  crying quieted down; though her body continued to furiously tremble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mats… Matsuri?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  Ana could even add to her sentence Matsuri lunged at her. Wrapping her  arms around Ana’s waist, Matsuri buried her head in Ana’s chest. Ana’s  nightshirt started to stain with the rushing waves of Matsuri’s tears.  Even so, she sat completely still in the silence while Matsuri sobbed  into her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A… Ana! I-I had, had a dream…!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ana just  smiled and wrapped her arms around Matsuri. Using her left hand, Ana  tenderly ran her fingers through Matsuri’s hair and stroked the back of  her head. With her right hand, Ana caressed her childish friend’s back,  hoping to stop the incessant trembling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After several moments  Matsuri had calmed down enough that her shaking ceased. Though she was  still sniffling and trying to control her tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry. I woke you up didn’t I? I’m sorry, Ana. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Matsuri… please. Promise me that you won’t leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ana’s  words were weak, as if she was resisting the impulse to cry as well.  Matsuri sniffled and thought for a moment before responding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ana, why would I leave? It’s the middle of the night?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took everything Ana had to resist laughing at her friend’s reply.  Instead, she tightened her grip on Matsuri and proceeded to lovingly  stroke her hair. Matsuri, still bewildered by her friend’s words,  decided to disregard them for the time being, and hugged Ana even  harder. The two girls, still holding one another, lowered themselves  onto the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Time passed and eventually Matsuri fell asleep  again. The nearby alarm clock continued ticking away the seconds of the  late evening. Although Ana Coppola was still wide awake, she did not  care anymore. She was far too busy embracing her closest and dearest  friend, Matsuri Sakuragi, so as to insure that there would be no more  bad dreams.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ana knew that this night would end before long, so  she wanted to cherish every moment while she could. The young Brit  tilted her head down and pressed her lips against Matsuri’s forehead.  After giving her companion one last good night kiss, she whispered into  the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sweet dreams, Matsuri.”</span></p>
