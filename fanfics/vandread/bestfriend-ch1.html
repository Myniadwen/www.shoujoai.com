<h1>The Best of Friends</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vandread/index.html">Vandread</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blackviper.html">Black Viper</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I hardly see any fanfics about Vandread, especially Yuri ones...

Hehehe....

I finally revised this story, I got way too much feed back on this 
story. So I&#39;m giving them what they want! Hope you become gentler with 
this one. But this is basically better than the last one...

But it is definitely more.... ummm.... anyway you know what I mean.

The night is young,

The moon, forever bright.

Love is never how you want it to bet,

Always expect the unexpected...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildings demolished, the stench of death in the air, the cries of the 
innocent as they were massacred. Blood everywhere, nothing but death and 
destruction until the horizon.

&quot;Destruction...&quot;

&quot;Chaos....&quot;

&quot;Death....&quot;

&quot;No one is here...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m all alone...&quot;

&quot;No one to help me...&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;NO!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!&quot;

I found myself waking up from my horrible nightmare, no, my greatest 
fear...

The fear of being alone, having no one to share my life.

Dieing alone, with no one there to comfort me in my final hours.

A dream I wish would never come true.

&quot;Barnette, are you okay?&quot;

It&#39;s Jura, looks like she was pretty worried.

&quot;Barnette, What&#39;s wrong with you? You seem to be always having bad 
dreams these days.&quot;

Of course she wouldn&#39;t know how I feel, after my dread almost crashed, 
I&#39;ve been having more of these dreams than I would like.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Jura, it&#39;s nothing really.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure? *You* were screaming after all.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much Jura, I&#39;m fine anyway. But can you just come with 
me to the bridge for a minute?&quot;

&quot;Sure, but why?&quot;

&quot;I just need to clear my head for awhile.&quot;

==== Soon ====

The halls are empty, no one on the bride except us. Every one must be 
still sleeping. The stars are so beautiful tonight.

&quot;*Yawn*, why did we have to go to the bride anyway?&quot;

&quot;All these dreams I&#39;ve been having recently are really starting to scare 
me. I don&#39;t know how much more I can take&quot;

I try to hold my tears from falling from Jura, but I couldn&#39;t.

She wiped my tears of with her hand and did her best to comfort me.

&quot;I&#39;ll always be here for you Barnette, you have nothing to fear, dear.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

That was all I could mutter, Jura has been a really good friend for me. 
And I don&#39;t think I could ever pay her back for all that she has done 
for me.

&quot;It&#39;s getting late Barnette, we should go back and you should try and go 
back to sleep.&quot;

Just by walking these halls I can still remember my dream, but this time 
Jura&#39;s here to keep me company. As we walked back to our room I was 
starting to feel a whole lot calmer. But still I felt a little bit 
uneasy; I was still scared that the dream would happen again.

After a while I&#39;m still awake, lucky for Jura, she is sleeping like a 
baby. I quietly go into her covers and snuggle close to her. And after 
awhile I am starting to feel more secure, more peaceful and relaxed now. 
I look into Jura&#39;s face and see that she looks so innocent, like an 
angel. What am I saying? Jura? Innocent? An angel? I have got to be 
kidding. But she does look so peaceful. After awhile I fall asleep next 
to her.

==== NEXT DAY====

*ATTENTION!!! ATTENTION!!! *

*ALL PERSONEL REPORT TO THE DOCKING AREA. *

*I REPEAT... *

Shit! Why now of all times? Just when I start to get some rest. Well I 
better go.

&quot;Hahhh! Take this! And this! You will feel my power!&quot;

Oh Great. It&#39;s Hibiki showing off again. Just once I&#39;d wish he&#39;d take 
battles more seriously. So much for that hope.

&quot;Uchuji-san! Unite with Dita!&quot;

&quot;Now&#39;s not the time Dita!&quot;

&quot;But Uchuji-san, you promise me! Besides, Dita can help you!&quot;

Huhhhh.... Great, just great a lovers quarrel right in a middle of a 
battle.

&quot;Dita, Hibiki stop fighting and concentrate!&quot;

I&#39;ll never understand what Dita sees in that man.

&quot;AHHHHHHHHHH! OUCH!&quot;

I&#39;ve been hit. SHIT! My controls froze. The enemy is cornering me. No! I 
don&#39;t want to die alone! Not like in my dream! This can&#39;t happen. 
Someone help me! Someone help me! PLEASE HELP ME!!!!

&gt;Simulation terminated&lt;

&quot;Barnette control yourself! It was just a simulation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m scared Jura! I don&#39;t want to be alone. I feel so scared...&quot;

&quot;Barnette please, you have got to relax! You&#39;re becoming too tense!&quot;

Jura is right. I am too tense. But I can&#39;t help it. My fear of being 
alone is too much to bear. I have to relax or else I will be in no 
condition to fight.

&quot;Barnette, why don&#39;t we go and eat for awhile, maybe that will calm you 
down.&quot;

====================== Meanwhile =============================

&quot;Pai, be sure to be extra careful with this flower, it&#39;s petals and 
pollen has extremely potent results with unknown effects.&quot;

&quot;Kero, kero. Why what could it do?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I want you to put this away for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Kero, kero, sure what ever you say...&quot;

(A few minutes later...)

&quot;Hayyyy.... What was it that I was supposed to do to this weed? I&#39;ll 
leave it on the kitchen counter for a while... Kero, kero, no one will 
miss it anyway...&quot;

&quot;Here Barnette, you&#39;ve got to relax, you&#39;re too tense and you seem to 
panicking a lot lately.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right...*Sigh*&quot;

&quot;Wait here and I&#39;ll get some soothing oils so that you can relax, okay?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, but you don&#39;t have to worry too much.&quot;

Jura worries about me too much... I don&#39;t deserve a friend like her.

&quot;oooh, what a beautiful flower, *sniff* *sniff*, *COUGH* what a weird 
aroma, I&#39;m suddenly feeling dizzy....&quot;

&quot;What kind of flower is that? Huhhhnnn.... (Passes out)&quot;

=== A few minutes later ===

&quot;Uhhh... What happened? I feel strange...&quot;

I was on my way to the infirmary because of the way I felt...

It was like my body was burning and craving for something at the same 
time.

But instead of going to the infirmary I went to my room instead, because 
I don&#39;t want any man touching me. I fall on my bed and fall asleep with 
my clothes still on me. I fell asleep for sometime before coming to. I 
awoke to see Jura changing in the mirror, and could not help myself from 
admiring her elegant figure. The sensation within me started to grow 
only stronger and stronger. Then at that moment I knew what my body was 
telling me. I went closer to Jura and...

&quot;Jura, you were always there when I needed you, you have been more than 
a friend to me. Jura, I love you....&quot;

At that time after speaking those words I kissed her.

Then just realizing what I have done I pushed away, I was terrified. I 
let my emotions get the best of me and because of that I might lose the 
only person that I now know that I care for. Then suddenly the most 
unexpected thing happened...

&quot;Barnette, I love you too...&quot;

As Jura kissed me back passionately. I could feel her tongue penetrating 
my lips, trying to find it&#39;s way into my mouth. We kissed passionately 
for sometime when I decided to break the kiss; I was craving for Jura&#39;s 
luscious body.

&quot;Jura...I want you.&quot;

As I began to undress Jura, my right hand was massaging Jura&#39;s left 
breast through her bra, it was so good to feel and continued to 
completely undress her. Jura pushed us back to the bed as now she was 
completely nude and I was never happier seeing her face. I began to suck 
on Jura&#39;s huge nipples while she was stroking my head as if encouraging 
me to do it more. For sometime we went back to kissing since we were 
each massaging the other&#39;s chest each feeling the joy of the other&#39;s 
touch. Stroking Jura&#39;s leg, my hand started to head upward as if by 
instinct. She started to do the same too. And at that moment we knew 
that soon we would be one. I could feel that her panties were already 
soaking wet.

&quot;Barnette...Barnette...Barnette...&quot;

She kept repeating my name as I was massaging her pink flower. We 
experienced pleasure not like any before, and it was due to our love for 
each other. We could no longer hold our emotions within; we came 
together in each other&#39;s arms our grasp on each other was weakening but 
I never did let go of her. We lay silently in the soaked bed, Jura fell 
asleep due to all the &quot;Love&quot; I gave her. And at that time I realized 
that I was wrong, this was the moment that I could never be happier 
because now I know that she will never leave my side. All my fears have 
seeped away from the void that was my mind. And with my last moments of 
consciousness I whispered into her ear &quot;I love you, and I will never 
leave your side...&quot;

=======Meanwhile==========

&quot;Pai, where is the flower that I told you to put aside?&quot;

&quot;Kero, Kero, do mean that weed?&quot;

&quot;Yes, where did you put it?&quot;

&quot;I forgot, it won&#39;t hurt anyone anyway right?&quot;

&quot;The flower&#39;s pollen contains a special chemical that once inhaled may 
cause a person to things they normally wouldn&#39;t do...&quot;

&quot;Kero, is that all? Kero, kero...&quot;

The End

(But not for Jura and Barnette...)</pre>
