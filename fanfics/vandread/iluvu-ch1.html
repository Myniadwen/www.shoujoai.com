<h2>a <a href="../vandread/index.html">Vandread</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jenbot.html">Jen Bot</a><br> </h2>
<pre>   A young blue-haired woman stands at the deck of the ship...


   As I stare into the vastness of space I could only think of the young 
girl with auburn hair who&#39;d stolen my heart. I was angered by this long 
ago I promised myself to give up all human emotion hate, anger 
jealousy,... LOVE. But it seems all it seems all I think about is her I 
know she doesn&#39;t feel the same. It&#39;s obvious to everyone she loves 
Hibiki Tokai it&#39;s almost as if those two were made for each other, 
though I knew all of this I still fell in love with her. From that smile 
to her laugh and that constant optimism of her&#39;s, I love everything 
about her. A single tear rolled down my cheek she&#39;ll never return the 
love I have for her.

  &quot;Dita.&quot; The word single that escapes my lips.

  &quot;Why do you do this too me.&quot; I whisper softly to myself.

   As I walk down the corridor to my room the only distinct able sound 
that could be heard were my own footsteps. So it surprised me when I 
heard it an all to familiar voice calling me.

  &quot;Meia.&quot; It was her. I turned around quickly to see my beloved standing 
only a few feet away with a slight flush of red staining her perfect 
features.

  &quot;Um... Can I talk to you about something?&quot;

  &quot;Sure.&quot; I say sounding a some-what hesitant.

  &quot;O.K. follow me to my room.&quot; I nodded and followed her in silence the 
whole way. When we arrived she instructed me to sit on her bed while she 
stood. She kept the lights dim so we could really make out each other.

  &quot;There&#39;s um...been something I&#39;ve wanted to talk to you about.&quot; She 
stuttered out nervously.

  &quot;What is it?&quot; I asked sounding a bit nervous myself.

  &quot;Well I...&quot; She sits down next to me my face instantly turns bright 
red, I was suddenly grateful for the dim lighting.

  &quot;I can&#39;t take it anymore Meia I...I love you.&quot; My whole body froze and 
stiffened, I&#39;ve dreamed of her saying those words but never did I think 
I would actually hear them.

  &quot;Meia don&#39;t be me at mad at me.&quot; She says with her head downcast 
sounding to be on the verge of tears. I used my hand to slowly lift her 
head only to see two streams of tears pouring down her cheeks.

  &quot;Dita&quot; I said slowly. &quot;I love you too.&quot; Her eyes light up in 
astonishment at me. &quot;But I thought you loved Hibiki.&quot; Her face becomes 
uncharacteristically hard.

  &quot;Mr. Alien is my friend and nothing more I only love you.&quot; There she 
said it again I&#39;m officially in heaven. When I stared back into Dita&#39;s 
face I realized our lips were separated by mere inches. Slowly we leaned 
in to share what would be our first kiss. She tasted sweet her lips full 
and juicy and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from deepening the kiss. She opened 
her mouth slightly and my tongue happily accepted the invitation. When 
we broke the kiss I was to see how we were both out of breath, I looked 
to her to that famous smile only this time it looked passionate lustful 
even.

  &quot;That was great.&quot; She says sounding quite childish and I couldn&#39;t help 
but laugh she soon joined in only to stop abruptly.

  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I ask innocently.

  &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you smile it&#39;s so beautiful&quot; She said in a low husky 
voice.

  She looked so sincere and loving a wave of passion seemed to descend 
upon me and in the next moment my lips devoured her&#39;s in a deep kiss. My 
hands began slowly pulling off her jacket while she proceeds to unzip my 
full body suit. Desperately I grip at the bottom of her shirt trying to 
lift it above her head, now finished unzipping me she was unbuttoning 
her skirt. I back away to step out my jump suit. I looked up only to see 
how lovely she looked in her lingerie. Her lace pink bra looked as if 
her barely hold her ample bosom and due to the material I could see her 
nipples were hard and erect. When I noticed her matching thong panties 
my lust for her grew ten folds. I now spied her hard gaze sweeping over 
my figure I wore only black bikini style panties, her eyes now stuck on 
my rather pert breast. When she realized I caught her lingering gaze her 
face once again became flushed. Coming closer to her I eased her body 
into a laying down position before getting on top of her and engaging 
into another kiss. This time my hands explored her curves taking a 
moment to squeeze her firm but which made her let out a soft moan. I 
moved slowly from her neck to her collarbone planting soft kisses as I 
went while my hand unclasped the hook of her bra so I could get to her 
real prize.

  Her breast beautiful not to big but yet far from small. I began 
teasing her nipples by licking and nibbling them this caused her to 
release a chorus of moans, I begin suckling her breast harder to give 
her more pleasure. It worked of course and a tight grip was placed round 
my head when she finally released me I returned to planting soft kisses 
but this time to her lower half.. When I reached her belly button I 
traced a path around with my tongue. A loud groan the escaped my lover&#39;s 
lips just hearing it caused my whole body to shudder in pleasure. But 
now tiered of toying with her I moved toward my intended destination. 
Positioning myself between her legs I inhaled in her sweet musky scent I 
licked my lips I couldn&#39;t wait to taste her. Using only my teeth I slid 
off her underwear once off my fingers began to play with the curls of 
her mound. She moaned again this time with a of irritation in it telling 
me she was tiered of waiting. Never being able to refuse her I obeyed 
her wishes my tongue began licking her clitoris.

  &quot;Me...Me...Meia.&quot; She cried out in ecstasy. Hearing this only made me 
want to pleasure her further I now begin to suck on her clit, she 
screamed out in pleasure. My tongue moved from her clit to the entrance 
of her channel. I first took a sampling lick to see how she tasted... 
wonderful just as I thought my tongue now parts the lips of her entrance 
only to be darted in and out in an intoxicating rhythm.

  &quot;Meia... I&#39;m coming.&quot; She whimpered as her legs clamped tightly around 
my head. In the next moment my face and chest were drenched in her 
fluids. Not wanting to waste such a fine delicacy I began licking up 
every sweet drop. When I finished I laid next to Dita as she tried to 
get her breathing down to a slower pace.

  &quot;That... was...wonderful.&quot; She says between breaths.

  &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to be with you for so long.&quot; I said as my fingers traced 
the outline of her jaw.

  &quot;But it&#39;s not over at least not yet.&quot; She said with a mischievous 
smile across her face.

  In an instant I was pinned under her and engaged into another kiss as 
she began fondling my breast like a mad man. It was now my turn to moan 
in pleasure she stopped kissing me and turned her attention to my breast 
She started with a gentle nibbling which soon turned into bitting as I 
screamed in a mixture of pain and yet pleasure. She now licks a path 
down the center of my body till she reaches the one thing that stops 
her... my panties. She stares but only for a moment in the next instant 
with strength I never knew she possessed she rips them off me. She now 
stares my vagina in complete lust as three fingers slowly entered me. 
She pumps slowly at first each one putting me on a new level of 
pleasure. When I was on the verge of an orgasm she stops and removes her 
fingers licking off all my sweet nectar from them. She then sat me up 
and positioned our selves so our two sexes were touching. Then she 
started pumping her&#39;s against I in turn did the same, our breast and 
sexes pressed together it was too much for me.

  &quot;I&#39;m coming.&quot; I half groaned.

  &quot;Me too.&quot; She murmured, in the next moment we both climaxed 
simultaneously our fluids surely staining Dita&#39;s bed we lay holding each 
other tightly .

  &quot;That was great.&quot; I coughed out between breaths as I stared into her 
dazzling blue eyes.

  &quot;I hope no one heard us.&quot; She said with a giggle. At that moment I 
would never love some one the way I did her or could to bare to live in 
a world without her. She broke my train of thoughts with her question.

  &quot;Meia what are you thinking about?&quot;

  &quot;How much I love you.&quot; I said as I planted a soft kiss to her forehead 
she blushed yet again. Hours later we still lay together in a tight 
embrace and Dita had fallen asleep. I whispered one final comment to my 
now sleeping lover before my eye lids betrayed me and I drifted off to 
sleep.

  &quot;Dita I love you.&quot;
