<h1>The Missing Ingredient</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ionosamafanatics/index.html">Iono-sama Fanatics</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<P>Whenever queen Iono Mito Archeline
came to Japan, Eto Hachibe felt a certain chill of alarm run down her
spine. Not that she minded going home to see her family, of course,
and she knew that their cook Arata Tagoto enjoyed seeing her family
and their restaurant once again. But whenever Iono went traveling she
ended up causing trouble and picking up sobane (concubines), quite
often in equal measure.</P><P>Aruje frowned as the silver, white
haired girl bodyguard warily watched traffic, the group of them
having occupied a small cafe. Her mother Fletch pushed up her stylish
sunglasses, sitting across from Arata, her longtime lover. Kyas and 
Aida sat together, Aida gently needling her serious, glasses wearing
lover while Kyas tried to drink her tea.</P><P>“More tea?” Sarasa offered, the
tall, black haired part time student smiling as she reached their
tables, her uniform swirling around her legs.</P><P>“Please,” Iono smiled, wearing a
traditional kimono that still highlighted her curvy form. “You're
very sweet,” she added, “would you be interested in being my
sobane?”</P><P>Sarasa smiled, having been
propositioned by Iono before. “I'm sorry,” she answered firmly,
“but I'm promised to Seriho.”</P><P>Seriho Mugihoshi looked up as if the
smaller woman sensed Sarasa, her smile warm as she made up the tea.
The smaller woman was a expert on making tea, but sadly was rather
inept at the duties of running a business. Sarasa willingly provided
those skills, along with a depth of love she wondered if Seriho would
ever see.</P><P>“Seriho could join you,” Iono
suggested.</P><P>“Thank you,” Sarasa put out the
tea as she added seriously, “but no.”</P><P>“Oh poo,” Iono pouted cutely as
Eto fought back a laugh.</P><P>Iono seemed unable to pass an
attractive woman without at least trying to ask her to be one of her
sobane. She was very charming and good looking, too, which often lead
perfectly innocent young women agreeing to become sobane and
following her home. Of course Iono had good taste and so far the many
young women were contributing to the welfare of the kingdom, but as
Kyas often said a thousand sobane was a bit much.</P><P>“Iono-sama,” Eto reached out to
put her hand on Iono's as she asked, “I know there was business to
attend to in Japan, but Kyas could have easily handled it. Why did we
come to Japan?”</P><P>“She's right,” Kyas agreed, “you
have ulterior motives.”</P><P>Iono looked down shyly then up again
with a impish smile that inspired dread in the serious minded members
of their party. “I have recently determined a serious lack in the
ranks of sobane,” she informed them seriously, “a missing
ingredient to completing my harem!”</P><P>“Really?” Eto asked warily.</P><P>Iono rose 
suddenly and pointed towards
the sky dramatically as she declared, “We have no magical girl
sobane!”</P><P>“Huh?” even Aida looked surprised
as the others looked at Iono in surprise.</P><P>Iono clapped her hands, “I was
shocked to realize we don't have even one magical girl! Since there's
so many in Japan, I thought we should rush here immediately.”</P><P>“Couldn't I just wear a 
costume for
you occasionally?” Kyas offered, feeling mildly exasperated.</P><P>Aida grinned at her 
lover, “Oh, will
you?”</P><P>“Hush!” Kyas scolded her,
blushing.</P><P>“No,” Iono said as she pulled a
large binder from her kimono, “I've already determined a few
candidates. I'm sure I can get at least one!”</P><P>Eto put her head in her hands as the
others gathered around Iono and her binder of magica girl photos and
muttered, “Oh, this is not going to end well.”</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0</P><P>“Honey Flash!” the young police
woman cried, her clothes dissolving away as she shifted to a redhead
in a revealing tight bodysuit.</P><P>“Urk!” Iono made a happy sound at
seeing such a close look at her nudity, her nose fountained blood
then Iono collapsed unconscious.</P><P>“Iono-sama!” Aru yelped as she and
Eto helped catch her.</P><P>“Is she all right” Fletch
demanded, their driver still carrying half the net Iono had
considered using to catch the elusive shape shifting heroine.</P><P>“I think she's fine,” 
Kyas checked
Iono over, “it's just the sudden loss of blood.”</P><P>“Should we still try...?” Aru
gestured to the net.</P><P>“No,” Eto said after a moment,
“first, we should get her to the hotel. Once she's recovered we'll
decide if we want to go after her.” Eto and Kyas shared a serious
look, both of them deciding it might be best not to bring home a
sobane that inspired such a extreme reaction in their queen.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0</P><P>Cure Black and Cure White both looked
a bit bowled over as Iono talked to the two girls. “They look a bit
overwhelmed,” Fletch noted mildly.</P><P>“Uhm,” Cure Black had to ask, she
shorter brown hair flowing around her face,“what is a sobane?”</P><P>“It's a consort,” Iono 
smiled at
her warmly.</P><P>Cure Black's eyes widened a bit, “Uhm,
I'm not really into that.”</P><P>“It sounds...,” Cure White
murmured, her long black hair shimmering, “kind of interesting.”
She looked at Iono, “I wouldn't have to do anything till I'm
older?”</P><P>“Oh, no,” Iono shook her head, “I
have sworn not to take a young woman if she's under aged.”</P><P>“Well...,” Cure White 
looked
thoughtful.</P><P>“White, you can't,” Cure Black
took her hands in hers as she murmured, “I need you.”</P><P>Cure White looked into her eyes 
as she
smiled warmly, “You're right.” She looked over at Iono, “I'm
sorry.”</P><P>Iono shrugged with good humor, “Well,
the offer's always open.” She smiled impishly, “Maybe you both
can come to my kingdom when you're older.”</P><P>By the stunned looks on both their
faces, neither girl had considered that idea!</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0</P><P>Sailor Moon and her allies were in
trouble, but the pretty blonde felt safe in knowing her hero Tuxedo
Kamen would arrive. Any time now. Soon, anyway.</P><P>“Meatball head,” Sailor Mars
demanded as the black haired girl in the red trimmed uniform
struggled with her bonds, “get us out of this!”</P><P>“But Tuxedo Kamen is coming!”
Sailor Moon protested.</P><P>“Do you feel a little guilty about
doing this?” Aru asked as she sat on one end of the masked and
tuxedo clad hero.</P><P>“Nah,” Fletch shrugged as she sat
on his chest.</P><P>“Fear not!” a woman's voice boomed
out of the night, “for I will not allow fair maidens to come to
harm!”</P><P>“A woman?” Sailor Jupiter blinked,
her brown hair flowing down her back.</P><P>“I am Queen Iono Mito Archeline,”
the black haired beauty stood sillouetted by a floodlight provided by
Aida, “and I will save you.”</P><P>“She's beautiful,” Sailor Mercury
murmured then the blue haired girl blushed slightly.</P><P>Leaping down Iono cut them free 
with a
familiar looking sword cane, then pretended to attack the disguised
Kyas, who in true villain form uttered some threats then fled the
scene of the battle. “That was easy,” Sailor Venus blinked, her
long blond hair shimmering.</P><P>“Pretty ladies,” Iono gracefully
offered Sailor Moon a hand up, smiling at the others, “are you all
right?”</P><P>Sailor Jupiter smiled at the tall
young woman, “I am now.”</P><P>Iono smiled back warmly, “I'm glad.”</P><P>“Wow....” Sailor 
Moon murmured,
not even noticing Kyas removing her disguising makeup and the other
sobane hauling Tuxedo Kamen away.</P><P>“Sailor Moon,” Iono said as she
tilted the blond haired girl's face up to gaze into her blue eyes,
“even in far off lands I've heard of you.”</P><P>Sailor Mars frowned even as Sailor
Mercury sighed, “So cool.”</P><P>“I have a important question to ask
you,” Iono said as Sailor Moon nearly swooned.</P><P>“Ask it,” Sailor Moon breathed
out.</P><P>“Will you be my sobane?”</P><P>“HUH?!” all five Sailors blurted.</P>
