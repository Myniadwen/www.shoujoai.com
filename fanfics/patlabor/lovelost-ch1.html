<h1>Love's Lost Labors (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../patlabor/index.html">Patlabor</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The lieutenant finished signing the last document and slapped it onto 
the &quot;finished&#39; pile for her assistant to file in the morning. With 
some surprise, she noted that it was later than she had thought. She&#39;d 
have to hustle to get home and get her journal typed in order to get 
any decent amount of sleep before the conference tomorrow.

She shut the computer down, taking care to lock any sensitive papers 
and disks in her drawer, then glanced around her office, assuring 
herself that there wasn&#39;t anything that needed her attention before 
she left. With a nod of satisfaction, she flicked off the light and 
locked the door behind her.

The night was balmy, a typical New York August night. The sky was 
clear &#150; or would have been, in a place where the light pollution was 
less prominent. She looked upwards, saw that a few stars had managed 
visibility and felt pleased, at herself and the world. She&#39;d traveled 
to many other cities, lived on several other continents; but there was 
nowhere to compare with New York City in Lt. Kanuka Clancy&#39;s mind.

Traffic was light, no taxis appeared immediately available, so Kanuka 
set off for a subway station closer to midtown. It was a longish walk, 
but the evening air felt good, as good as the general buzz of energy 
in the city around her. Even at this late hour, cars, trucks and 
emergency vehicles danced with the taxis that sped by&#133;too fast, she 
noted. It was a long time since she had pulled street duty, much less 
traffic patrol - she wasn&#39;t about to let a few minor infractions 
bother her tonight.

No, she had larger things to worry about. Tomorrow, the conference, 
then the weekend and&#133;what? Her lips pursed, thinking over the 
uncomfortable scene that would likely occur when&#133;Kanuka shook her head 
abruptly as if in answer to a question. 

&quot;I will not let myself get sidetracked this time,&quot; she stated firmly, 
only realizing she had spoken out loud when the woman next to her 
asked her if she had said something. Kanuka blushed slightly, glad for 
the sodium light glow that masked her embarrassment. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she 
said, but the woman had already moved on. No one lingered for long on 
a New York street, not even to speak to a cop. Maybe especially not to 
speak to a potentially crazy cop, Kanuka thought to herself.

The crowds were sporadic and Kanuka found herself alone once again on 
the street approaching the Port Authority. The area was never, had 
never been, the safest in the city, and all pretense at glitz and 
veneer had worn away in the last few decades. She kept her eyes up and 
her awareness on maximum, noting the positions of the other 
pedestrians, the loafers, drug dealers, and the few cops on patrol. 
She nodded slightly to a patrolman who caught her eye. He touched his 
hat brim briefly in acknowledgement and turned away.

Kanuka took a deep breath, immediately regretting it. The ammonia 
smell of urine, exhaust and hot streets made her choke. She stifled a 
cough and laughed out loud &#150; she&#39;d never be able to explain to anyone 
else why she loved this city so much &#150; or why she felt she needed to 
leave it.

The smile on her face faded immediately. That was the crux of the 
problem, wasn&#39;t it? Eventually, soon, she&#39;d have to take the plunge 
and tell Kelly why she was leaving the city &#150; why she was leaving her. 
Kanuka bit her lip in thought. She knew her ex pretty well, and she 
knew that no matter how delicately she approached the subject her news 
would not be received with calm austerity. Kelly O&#39;Toole was Irish 
through and through and her reaction would be&#133;

&quot;Lieutenant Clancy?&quot; A voice called from across the street, faint 
above the traffic noise. &quot;Clancy Kanuka?&quot;

Kanuka looked up, startled. There was something unusual about the way 
her name had been pronounced&#133;she tried to identify the voice, but 
nothing leapt to her mind. However, recognition slid into place as 
soon as she caught site of the figure across the road waving at her. 
She lifted a cautious hand and smiled politely. 

&quot;Hello!&quot; she called, then gestured quickly, &quot;Wait there!&quot; Looking for 
a break in traffic, Kanuka sprinted across the lanes and vaulted a low 
traffic barrier until she found herself standing in front of another 
woman. The woman was about Kanuka&#39;s height, Asian, slightly built and 
with short, dark hair. She looked outwardly calm, but relieved to see 
a familiar face.

&quot;It is Clancy, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the other woman asked in halting English. 
&quot;We only met that 
once&#133;&quot; The look in her face said that she knew very well that her name 
was 
Clancy, but was still, after all this time, embarrassed by her 
behavior at their first 
meeting. 

Kanuka smiled tightly. &quot;And we were very drunk.&quot; She played along with 
the polite 
subterfuge. &quot; Please, call me Kanuka, um, Kumagami-san? What brings 
you to 
America?&quot;

The Japanese police officer smiled apologetically and switched 
languages. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, my English is still not as good as I&#39;d like. I 
understand well enough, but speaking&#133;&quot;

Kanuka nodded understandingly, &quot;I was lucky &#150; I grew up with both 
languages.&quot; She looked down at the luggage by Kumagami&#39;s feet. &quot;Do you 
have a hotel room arranged? I&#39;d be glad to assist you&#133;&quot;

Kumagami bowed slightly but shook her head, &quot;Please there&#39;s no need. 
I&#39;m here for the Patlabor conference and they&#39;ve got me booked into 
the,&quot; she pulled out a piece of paper, scanned it and read out loud, 
&quot;the Omni.&quot;

Kanuka made a face. &quot;That place is not really...acceptable. Here,&quot; she 
reached out and hefted the bag, which was not terribly heavy, &quot;let me 
bring you to a better hotel that costs a little less.&quot; Before the 
other woman could protest, Kanuka had whistled up a taxi and 
instructed the driver with an address.

&quot;Please, Kanuka-san,&quot; Kumagami said hastily as they entered the 
vehicle, &quot;don&#39;t go to any trouble for me&#133;&quot;

Kanuka reassured the other woman, &quot;Really, I&#39;m not, Kumagami-san &#150; I&#39;m 
saving you from a horrible experience.&quot; She gestured at the piece of 
paper still clutched in Kumagami&#39;s hand. &quot;That place is a dive. The 
Eastern is a better hotel and the accounting department will be happy 
that you saved some money. Besides, it&#39;s closer to the conference 
location.&quot;

The Japanese officer looked down at the paper, then at the American. 
&quot;Then thank you,&quot; she said solemnly with a small bow. &quot;And please, 
call me Takeo.&quot;

Kanuka nodded in solemn thanks. &quot;Takeo-san.&quot; She&#39;d forgotten how 
American she&#39;d become. Asking a perfect stranger, practically, to use 
her given name&#133;well, the Japanese woman had recovered quickly, so no 
harm done.

Both women were silent for a moment, then Kanuka asked, &quot;Is this your 
first time in America?&quot;


&quot;Not in America, no,&quot; Kumagami answered. &quot;I&#39;ve only been to 
California, though.&quot; She paused, &quot;And Hawaii,&quot; she said hesitantly, as 
if that might not be considered America in New York City.

Kanuka looked at her with pride, &quot;That&#39;s where I come from. I grew up 
in Hawaii.&quot;

&quot;But you live here in New York? That seems very far away.&quot;

&quot;It is. That&#39;s why I live here,&quot; and for the first time that day, 
Kanuka smiled brightly. 

Lt. Kumagami relaxed slightly. &quot;I know we never really hit it off the 
first time we met,&quot; she smiled back at the other woman, &quot;but I was 
very glad to see a familiar face here.&quot;

Kanuka didn&#39;t respond directly but instead asked, &quot;Are you very tired? 
If you&#39;re not, I can take you somewhere to eat that&#39;s good and not too 
expensive &#150; or we can go get a drink&#133;&quot;

Kumagami waved away the idea frantically, &quot;Oh no! I don&#39;t mean for you 
to disrupt your schedule for me! I&#39;ll be fine once I check in&#133;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Kanuka insisted. &quot;Really, I&#39;d like to show you 
around. I&#39;ve got nothing I need to rush home to.&quot; 

&quot;But won&#39;t you need to get some sleep &#150; you&#39;re one of the presenters 
tomorrow, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but later in the morning. And I can get by on very little 
sleep.&quot; 

Kumagami relented. &quot;Although I know you&#39;re going to too much trouble,&quot; 
she said, &quot;I&#39;d be delighted. I&#39;m not too tired, but I am quite 
hungry.&quot;

&quot;I know just the place,&quot; the American officer said and subsided into a 
pleased silence.
