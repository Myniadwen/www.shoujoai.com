<h1>Rebuilding (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../patlabor/index.html">Patlabor</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;All right,&quot; Shinobu Nagumo, captain of Police Special
Vehicle Section 2, Division 1 addressed her team,
&quot;we&#39;re having a tech team from Shinohara Heavy
Industries in to go over the Labors. I expect full
cooperation from the staff and officers.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; was chorused back, the men and women
saluting.

Shinobu smiled slightly, her black hair neatly tied
back. &quot;The techs will be familiar to some of you,&quot; she
added, &quot;give them a warm welcome.&quot; With that she
headed back to her office, smiling as she noticed her
friend lingering within.

Kiichi Goto smiled slightly, the almost sleepy looking
captain of Division 2 sitting casually at his desk.
&quot;You know,&quot; Goto noted, &quot;I&#39;m almost looking forward to
seeing them.&quot;

&quot;I never thought either of them would leave,&quot; Shinobu
noted.

&quot;For a bird to fly, it must first leave the nest,&quot;
Goto noted. He paused, &quot;I understand they&#39;ve done
pretty well, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad for them,&quot; Shinobu noted as she sat down at
her desk.

&quot;Personally though, they&#39;ve not done so well,&quot; Goto
added.

Shinobu looked at him with barely concealed amusement.
&quot;I still find it surprising how much you keep
informed,&quot; she noted.

&quot;They are my people,&quot; Goto noted, &quot;I keep an eye on
them.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Shinobu murmured, turning to her paperwork once
more. Treacherously, the thought teased the corner of
her mind, &#145;I wonder what it&#39;ll be like, seeing her
again?&#39;

&quot;So, who do you think the techs are?&quot; One of the
maintenance men asked their chief as they worked on
one of the massive Labors, &quot;Officers who moved on to
the technical side?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Shigeo Shiba pushed up his cap, the chief
shrugging as he sat back on the gantry leaning up
against the Labor&#39;s mid-section, &quot;but hopefully
they&#39;ll know what...&quot; He trailed off as a jeep arrived
and a young woman climbed out.

&quot;What?&quot; the young man blinked at his boss.

&quot;Noa!&quot; Shigeo cried out as he clambered down the
ladder and ran across the hanger and over to her side.

Noa Izumi laughed as the taller man hugged her, other
old timers gathering around to exchange greetings.
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; the redish brown haired woman
said, dressed in a simple white and black jump suit.

&quot;Damn, you&#39;re the one working for Shinohara Heavy
Industries?&quot; Shiego asked, looking down at her in
surprise.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m pretty good at this stuff,&quot; Noa said as she
took a offical id badge out of her pocket and clipped
it to her clothes. She dropped her voice, &quot;Heard about
Ohta?&quot;

&quot;Instructor at the police academy,&quot; Shiego nodded,
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be turning out lots of little Ohtas
any day now.&quot;

&quot;And isn&#39;t THAT a scary thought,&quot; Noa agreed. She
smiled, &quot;Hate to cut this short, but I should check
in.&quot;

&quot;Want to bet he knows you&#39;re coming,&quot; Shiego nodded as
he stepped aside.

Noa smiled wryly as she went by, &quot;I&#39;m not that
foolish.&quot;

Noa found herself retracing her steps up to that
office by memory, moving through the buildings with
the ease of old familiarity. She hesitated at the door
a moment then knocked firmly, comforted by the old
wood beneath her knuckles.

&quot;Come,&quot; Goto called and Noa entered, looking around
before fixing her eyes on her old captain. Goto hadn&#39;t
changed much, still a thin man in a orange and white
uniform shirt and blue pants, his eyes half closed and
face largely unmarked by age.

&quot;Noa Izumi, reporting,&quot; Noa smiled slightly as she
threw a picture perfect salute.

Goto chuckled softly, &quot;No need to do that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you, sir,&quot; Noa said with a smile,
hugging the man and actually getting a startled look
from his normally calm face.

Shinobu fought back a chuckle, watching as Noa pulled
back from the taller man. &quot;It&#39;s nice to see you&#39;ve
done so well,&quot; she noted.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Noa nodded to her respectfully, &quot;I&#39;m doing
all right.&quot;

Shinobu felt a surprising quiver within her at meeting
the younger woman&#39;s eyes, a unusual falling sensation.
Deciding it might be safer to stick to business she
said, &quot;So, what can we expect from you?&quot;

&quot;With the rest of my team we&#39;ll be examining the
labors mechanical systems and how they relate to the
new operating system,&quot; Noa said, &quot;as well as
confirming reports from your own pilots and
mechanics.&quot;

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Goto noted blandly.

&quot;I get the fun job,&quot; Noa&#39;s eyes twinkled, &quot;in addition
to supervising many of the tech boys I&#39;ll be test
piloting the Labors.&quot;

&quot;Will Asuma be assisting you?&quot; Shinobu felt compelled
to ask.

&quot;No,&quot; Noa hesitated a moment, &quot;we don&#39;t work together
anymore, not since we broke up.&quot; Her cellphone rang
out into the silence, &quot;Excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Goto murmured so softly only Shinobu
could hear.

Noa closed up her phone, &quot;Looks like my team&#39;s
arrived, I&#39;d better get to work.&quot; She bowed slightly,
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Goto nodded as she headed out.

Shinobu frowned, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear about her and
Asuma.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Goto conceded, &quot;though maybe it&#39;s for the
best.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Shinobu gave him a look but Goto just smiled.

Over the next few days Shinobu found herself working
closely with Noa, possibly more closely than when they
served together as officers and quickly found herself
coming to certain conclusions. Firstly, Noa was as
capable in her own way as Shinobu, she was just less
obvious about it. Secondly, Noa easily commanded the
respect of her crew, despite her informality, rather
unlike Shinobu. Three... well. Three, Noa was even
cuter than she had been when Shinobu first noticed
her, years ago.

Blushing faintly Shinobu made herself confront that
thought. Despite romantically sparring with Goto for
years, not to mention the abortive fling with a
married man years ago, she still found herself feeling
uncomfortably drawn to Noa. In fact, if she was going
to be honest, she had been attracted to the boyish
young woman way back then, too.

&quot;So,&quot; Goto calmly asked her once she was done
confessing to him, &quot;what are you going to do about it
now?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re taking this awfully well,&quot; Shinobu noted.

&quot;I know you pretty well,&quot; Goto noted, &quot;and we&#39;re
friends. I&#39;d like to see you happier, if that&#39;s
possible.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Shinobu smiled slightly.

&quot;So, are you going to ask her out?&quot; Goto asked.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Shinobu blurted.
