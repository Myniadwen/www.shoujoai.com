<h1>Rebuilding (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../patlabor/index.html">Patlabor</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../patlabor/rebuilding-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Noa Izumi smiled as the redish brown haired woman
walked from Labor to Labor, her teams crawling all
over them as they worked away. &quot;Hey,&quot; she raised her
voice a bit as a tech banged a panel by accident with
his wrench, &quot;treat the Labors with respect.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; the boy called back sheepishly.

Shigeo Shiba smiled slightly, peering out from his
ever present cap. &quot;Must be odd,&quot; he said quietly to
Noa, &quot;to be called ma&#39;am now.&quot;

&quot;It does take some getting used to,&quot; Noa conceded. &#39;Of
course,&#39; she silently added, &#39;a lot of things in my
life are taking time to get used to.&#39;

Being back here at Police Special Vehicle Section 2
again after being at Shinohara Heavy Industries was
very odd, especially following her break up with
Asuna. She found herself buried in memories both good
and bad, reminded of old companions and current
friends. Even odder, she found herself paying
attention to one person in particular.

Stealing a glance up to the catwalk circling the
hanger Noa again gazed at Shinobu Nagumo and felt that
odd, nervous feeling in the bottom of her gut. It
wasn&#39;t an entirely comfortable sensation, and it made
her wonder what Shinobu might be thinking about as she
watched them working away.

&quot;Worried about screwing up in front of the captain?&quot;
Shigeo guessed with a frightening degree of
perceptiveness.

Noa scratched the back of her head nervously as she
agreed, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be?&quot; A deep breath, &quot;She&#39;s one
of the best.&quot;

Shigeo looked up with a smile, &quot;And here she comes
now.&quot; Making sure his cap was straight he ambled off,
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;

Noa stiffened a bit, then took a relaxing breath as
Shinobu descended the stairs with a undeniable grace.
She filled out her uniform like a model, the older
woman drawing admiring glances from everyone in the
room, including Noa.

&quot;How are things progressing?&quot; Shinobu asked as she
took up a place by Noa, her subtle flagrance drifting
over to tease Noa&#39;s nose.

&#39;She smells nice,&#39; Noa found herself noting
distractedly. &quot;Fist checks are done,&quot; she reported,
almost like they had in the old days, &quot;and we&#39;re
making a few adjustments based on your pilot&#39;s
reports.&quot;

&quot;Right on schedule,&quot; Shinobu nodded to Noa approvingly
as she added, &quot;good job.&quot;

Noa nearly wiggled in pleasure at the casually given
compliment. &#39;God, I can&#39;t believe she can still do
this to me,&#39; she thought, thinking of how she had
responded to Shinobu&#39;s authority in the old days.
&quot;Next up is piloted tests,&quot; she kept her voice even
with effort, &quot;though we wont be able to start till
tomorrow.&quot;

Shinobu looked down at the shorter Noa, the expression
on her face oddly unreadable. &quot;I&#39;m interested in
hearing the details of the new upgrade,&quot; she calmly
noted, &quot;would you have time to discuss it?&quot;

Noa nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot; She mentally went over her
tasks remaining, &quot;It&#39;d probably have to be later
today, though.&quot;

&quot;How about over dinner?&quot; Shinobu offered, a faint
smile teasing her lips.

Noa blinked, looking up into Shinobu&#39;s eyes and
feeling her heart skip a beat. Yet the taller woman&#39;s
expression was still mostly unreadable as Noa
struggled to form a coherent response. &quot;That&#39;d be
great,&quot; she managed to get out.

&quot;It&#39;ll have to be here as my Division is on call,&quot;
Shinobu frowned slightly, &quot;but I believe I can manage
something nice. Seven o&#39;clock good?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Noa nodded happily.

&#39;Oh my,&#39; Noa though as a rare thought zinged into her
brain, &#39;what am I going to wear?&#39; While she was
certain this wasn&#39;t anything like a date, being asked
to eat with Shinobu was important, and all she had
with her were her work jumpsuit. &#39;I&#39;ll have to ask
around,&#39; she thought, &#39;see what I can borrow, maybe.&#39;

The day passed in a odd combination of agonizing
slowness and busy rushing as Noa did her work, fine
tuning Labors while also beg, borrowing and stealing
items she could possibly make into a outfit. By the
end of the day she had black pants, a matching vest
and white shirt, a passable costume if she did say so
herself.

Walking through the hanger Noa was surprised to hear
her name called, then blinked as her former captain
appeared. &quot;Sir?&quot; Noa asked.

&quot;Shinobu has taken over the office,&quot; Goto said, the
oddly sleepy looking captain of Division 2 smiling
slightly, &quot;you&#39;ll be eating up there.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Noa bowed slightly.

Goto casually waved that off, &quot;Glad to help. You two
have fun now.&quot; With that he wandered off, whistling
softly.

&#39;What was that about?&#39; Noa wondered as she headed for
the stairs up to the office he and Shinobu shared.

Reaching the door Noa knocked, then heard Shinobu
call, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Pushing the door open Noa entered the office, her eyes
widening a bit as she took in the scene. The desk
Shinobu used had been cleared and several covered
dishes awaited, along with two plates. A tablecloth,
candles and subdued lighting made it look almost like
a scene from some romantic movie.

&quot;Ah, hi,&quot; Noa managed, suddenly feeling very glad that
she had scrounged together some nice looking clothes.

Shinobu had changed from her uniform to a simple black
dress, but on her it looked like high fashion. Cut low
in the front it hugged her breasts like a lover, slid
down her fit body and stopped just high enough to be
daring. In short, she looked stunning.

&quot;The takeout the boys got is still hot,&quot; Shinobu said
briskly, but her eyes lingered on the boyishly dressed
Noa, &quot;we&#39;d better get started.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Noa croaked, then cleared her throat. &#39;I
never knew Shinobu could be this sexy,&#39; she thought to
herself weakly.

The food was delicious, and surprisingly the
conversation flowed easily as well. Shinobu guided
them easily from a professional discussion of the
Labor upgrade to entertainment and other topics, all
with suck skill it wasn&#39;t obvious she was going it.

&quot;Here, have some more sake,&quot; Shinobu poured with
obvious skill.

Noa took it while stealing a glance into Shinobu&#39;s
eyes. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said after taking a drink.

&quot;Pardon if I&#39;m prying,&quot; Shinobu met her eyes as she
took a drink, &quot;but what happened between you and
Asuna? I would have thought you&#39;d be a perfect match.&quot;

Noa sighed softly, stirring the food on her plate. &quot;So
did I,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but it turns out we had very
different ideas of the role I&#39;d play in our lives.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Shinobu asked gently.

&quot;He wanted a house wife,&quot; Noa said wryly, &quot;and I had
no intention of giving up my job.&quot; She smiled
slightly, &quot;Still, I think we parted on good terms. I
only punched him once.&quot;

Shinobu had to fight back a snort of laughter even as
Noa grinned. Giving in and laughing she asked,
&quot;Seriously?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Noa smirked. She took another drink, &quot;How about
you? Do you have any romantic follies to talk about?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Shinobu shook her head, &quot;sorry to say.&quot;

Noa hesitated, &quot;I always though you and the captain
might...&quot;

Shinobu chuckled softly at that. &quot;Goto is a very good
friend, but he&#39;s too good of a friend to be a lover,
if you know what I mean,&quot; she explained.

&quot;The Labor team would be shocked to hear that,&quot; Noa
confessed, &quot;they&#39;ve got a betting pool on when you&#39;ll
get together.&quot;</pre>
