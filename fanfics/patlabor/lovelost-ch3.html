<h1>Love's Lost Labors (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../patlabor/index.html">Patlabor</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../patlabor/lovelost-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kanuka&#39;s day began in a swirl of activity. Unlike many people who 
claimed the skill, she was genuinely able to get by on very few hours 
sleep. As a result, by the time her alarm rang she was already dressed 
and at her kitchen table with a cup of tea. She ran a critical eye 
over her notes for the day&#39;s lecture and initialed the page. Her 
presentation would be very straightforward - she couldn&#39;t foresee any 
problem with it, but it paid to be prepared.

When the phone rang, she lifted her head and listened for the message, 
but made no move to pick it up. As she predicted, the girlish voice of 
Kelly came from the speaker.

&quot;Kanuka,&quot; Kelly spoke evenly, making very sure her words carried no 
weight or censure, &quot;I just wanted to wish you luck in your 
presentation today. Don&#39;t call &#150; I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot; There was a 
pause, then, &quot;We need to talk.&quot;

The phone clicked off. Kanuka sighed heavily. Why wasn&#39;t life ever 
simple? Kelly was a fine woman, a spectacular lover, and a fun person 
to be around. But she wanted stability &#150; a house in the country, a 
ring, a marriage and, Kanuka shuddered at the thought, children. 

And all I want is to be a police officer. The police force is my 
family. I want to die in service, and be buried with my comrades. Was 
that so hard to understand?

Her hair fell forward over her shoulders, almost into her tea. 
Standing, Kanuka emptied the cup into the sink and brushed her hair 
back from her face. She looked up into the reflection of her face in 
the window.

&quot;I need space,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;That&#39;s why I took the job 
offer.&quot; It was that simple really. She&#39;d be returning to Japan for the 
next few years, returning to work with a new Patlabor division &#150; a 
diplomatic division specifically to be used for high profile, 
government related jobs. A Labor honor guard, and she&#39;d be captain. 
Surely Kelly would understand that?

Kanuka shook her head and her reflection answered with a mournful 
shake of its own.

 

The conference was, by turns, uninspiring and educational. Kanuka was 
gratified to meet colleagues she had never met before, and more than a 
little glad to think that she wouldn&#39;t have to meet some of them 
again. Many of the presenters had been assigned this job by superiors 
and it showed. They droned their presentations until the audience was 
hard pressed to stay awake in the hot auditorium. On the other hand, a 
few of the speakers were, like Kanuka herself, genuinely enthusiastic 
about the future of Patrol Labors. Many of these people were contacts 
she already knew and it was good to reacquaint herself with them. 
Although she kept one eye out, Kanuka never saw Kumagami the whole 
day.

Kanuka changed out of her police uniform for the cocktail party that 
night, borrowing the room of a colleague who was staying in the hotel. 
She showered quickly, brushed out her hair and changed into silk 
blouse and slacks. She&#39;d have been more comfortable in her leather 
jacket, but the game had to be played properly and she knew it.

By the time she made her appearance at the cocktail party, the 
drinking was in full swing. Kanuka, glass in hand, made her way around 
the room, smiling and greeting potentially useful contacts higher in 
the police hierarchy. She was roped in by her superior and his cronies 
for a five-minute explanation of her new assignment, then excused 
herself to refresh her hardly touched drink. She checked her watch and 
looked towards the door. The next turn around the room netted her ten 
minutes of a senator&#39;s time and a compliment from another presenter 
from that day. Kanuka checked her watch again. Ten after eight. She 
looked around but there was no sign of Kumagami. She dropped her drink 
onto a passing waiter&#39;s tray and headed over to the bar.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so late,&quot; a voice said just behind her. Kanuka started 
and turned to face an apologetic Kumagami. The short-haired woman 
bowed and thanked her for waiting. &quot;I got tied up in a post-lecture 
discussion about Labor use in terrorism.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to attend that session, but I was required to be present at 
one of our local dignitaries&#39; speech on safe labor use in crowded 
areas. How was the speaker?&quot;

&quot;He wasn&#39;t very prepared.&quot; Kumagami said. She looked around the room. 
&quot;It&#39;s very crowded and hot in here. Have you made your presence 
known?&quot;

Kanuka nodded. &quot;Been around the room a few times. Is there anyone you 
need to be seen by?&quot;

Kumagami shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not important enough. Why?&quot;

&quot;I thought we might go somewhere less crowded for a drink. I didn&#39;t 
realize that you were interested in anti-terrorist work.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been involved in several incidents with the Second Division 
&#150; and Captain Goto is convinced it&#39;ll be a growing problem.&quot;

&quot;I agree with him,&quot; Kanuka confirmed. &quot;Let&#39;s go get something to eat 
and we can discuss his, and your views. I think I have some news that 
might interest you.&quot;

Kumagami&#39;s eyebrows lifted, but she only nodded.

The restaurant in the hotel was a tasteful and intimate space. The two 
women took their seats by the open French windows and looked out onto 
a sparkling cityscape.

&quot;It&#39;s a much more orange city than Tokyo is,&quot; Kumagami said. &quot;The 
lights, I mean.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kanuka agreed. &quot;I noticed that the first time I visited Japan. 
It gives each city a different feel.&quot;

&quot;Like Hong Kong &#150; it&#39;s a completely different kind of lighting 
altogether. Like multicolored jewels, or the stars.&quot;

They drank their wine in silence, each lost in their thoughts.

&quot;So,&quot; Kumagami began, &quot;you were saying that you have some news about 
anti-terrorist Labor use?&quot;

Kanuka nodded. &quot;I&#39;m working with a multinational task force right now 
&#150; we&#39;re developing guidelines for anti-terrorist labor teams. In 
fact...&quot; Kanuka turned to thank the waiter who had brought their 
appetizers. &quot;In fact, if all goes well, I&#39;ll be returning to Japan in 
a little while to help develop a new division of Patlabors, for use as 
escorts for diplomats and government officials.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s wonderful.&quot; Kumagami looked a little wistful. &quot;I love working 
with Second Division, but sometimes I wish I had a chance to do a 
little more.&quot;

&quot;Yes, wonderful...&quot; Kanuka said quietly, turning her attention towards 
her plate. The food was as exquisite as the view. 

&quot;Is it not a wonderful opportunity?&quot; Kumagami asked quietly. &quot;Or do 
you not want to go?&quot; She looked out the window and sighed. &quot;I can 
understand wanting to stay here. Everything&#39;s so alive, so vital, it&#39;s 
almost like you can hear the blood running through this city&#39;s veins.&quot;

Kanuka looked at her in surprise. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve 
always felt.&quot; She watched a couple stroll by arm in arm on the 
balcony. &quot;I want to go, though. This kind of work is exactly what I&#39;ve 
always wanted to do. And although I was only there for six months, I 
really loved living and working in Tokyo, it&#39;s just...&quot;

Kumagami sipped her wine. &quot;It&#39;s just that there&#39;s something keeping 
you here.&quot;

Kanuka looked out onto the city then back at her plate. &quot;Yes.&quot; She 
moved a few food remnants around on her plate with her fork. &quot;But you 
didn&#39;t travel halfway across the world to hear about me.&quot; She looked 
up, her face unreadable, and said, &quot;When we&#39;re done here, why don&#39;t we 
visit the Empire State Building &#150; the view is beautiful from the top.&quot;

&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; Kumagami said politely, allowing the change of 
subject to pass by without comment.

 

Kumagami looked like a kid, Kanuka thought. The Japanese policewoman 
craned her neck up to try and see the top of the Empire State 
Building, and looked around at the art deco architecture with wonder. 
Kanuka led the way out of the elevator and around the observation room 
out onto into the open air. A few tourist groups clustered around each 
other, taking pictures and laughing in several languages. Kanuka and 
Kumagami passed around the building to find a corner where there was 
room for them to stand at the railing.

&quot;That way is uptown,&quot; Kanuka gestured, &quot;New Jersey&#39;s to your left.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s very beautiful,&quot; Kumagami breathed. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kanuka agreed, then fell silent. They walked slowly around the 
building&#39;s perimeter, the American woman pointing out landmarks and 
buildings of interest. She and Kumagami spoke of crimes that had 
occurred at those places, or people they knew in common. Kanuka found 
her gaze, once or twice, lingering on Kumagami&#39;s face as she spoke, or 
her hair, as it moved in the wind. She wondered if this had been the 
source of their initial dislike for each other&#133;it wouldn&#39;t be the 
first time attraction and repulsion went hand in hand. Probably not. 
She started as the other woman spoke suddenly.

&quot;And here we are, back where we started &#150; just like life,&quot; Kumagami 
joked. &quot;What about getting something to drink? Do you know anywhere we 
can sit and be comfortable?&quot;

Kanuka smiled. &quot;Comfortable? No, not around here. I know a place that 
serves good sake&#39; though.&quot;

&quot;That sounds perfect &#150; as long as there&#39;s no karaoke involved.&quot; 
Kumagami said with complete seriousness.

&quot;No karaoke,&quot; Kanuka confirmed, equally seriously.
