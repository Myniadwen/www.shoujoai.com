<h1>Love's Lost Labors (part 5 of 6)</h1>

<a href="../patlabor/lovelost-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>They were laughing at something, some joke or other, when they rounded 
a corner and walked right into a small cluster of uniformed policemen. 
Kanuka wiped the smile off her face as she recognized them. The male 
policemen knew her and shot off a quick salute with she returned with 
alacrity, but the tall, redheaded female cop just nodded.

&quot;Kanuka,&quot; her voice was musical and girlish, even when she was on 
duty, and nothing could quite remove Donegal from her vowels. Kanuka 
nodded solemnly to Kelly and gestured at Kumagami as she introduced 
the other woman as her colleague from Japan.

Kelly gestured with her head and asked if she could have a moment of 
Kanuka&#39;s time. Clancy hesitated, but something told her that this was 
as good a time as any.

The two women walked off a short distance. Kanuka could see Kumagami 
smiling politely and attempting to engage the other cop in chitchat. 
She turned back to Kelly, only to blanch away from the accusing stare.

&quot;That was fast work, Kanuka,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;How long have you known 
each other?&quot;

Kanuka shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s not like that Kelly &#150; we&#39;re really just 
colleagues. I met her once before when I went back to Japan for a 
short time. She&#39;s my replacement at the Second Division.&quot;

&quot;Ah, another mech-head, then.&quot; Kelly&#39;s lips pulled back in a knowing 
smile. &quot;Don&#39;t try to pull one over on me, Kanuka. I have the gift of 
truth and you know it.&quot;

Kanuka sighed. One of the many drawbacks of life with Kelly &#150; her 
conviction that she was blessed with some supernatural power to &quot;see.&quot; 
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to do anything. We share an interest, that&#39;s all.&quot; She 
didn&#39;t state the obvious &#150; that it Kelly had never shown any interest 
in Labors, or Kanuka&#39;s work with them. Kanuka took a deep breath. 
Tonight wasn&#39;t the night to&#133;

&quot;You&#39;re leaving, aren&#39;t you?&quot; It was more a statement than a question. 
Kelly&#39;s eyes were full of hurt disappointment, but her tone was 
resigned. &quot;I&#39;ve seen it coming for a while.&quot;

Kanuka stared, her mouth open. How does one even answer something like 
that? She had never believed in Kelly&#39;s &quot;sight,&quot; but&#133;

Kelly looked back over towards Kumagami then shot a dark look at 
Kanuka. &quot;It&#39;s to be Japan, then?&quot;

Kanuka shut her mouth and cleared her throat. Keeping her voice low 
and even she said, &quot;Now&#39;s not the time to talk about it.&quot;

Kelly gave her a sad smile. &quot;Later, then. You can tell me all about 
it.&quot; She reached out a hand and squeezed Kanuka&#39;s arm briefly. &quot;Good 
night, Kanuka.&quot;

The tall redhead turned away, pasting a bright smile on her face and 
rejoined her colleagues. Kanuka took a few breaths, trying to 
determine what Kelly had meant by it all, before she also joined the 
others.

Kumagami held up a picture and waved it in Kanuka&#39;s direction. In 
English she said, &quot;Look what Officer Jamison has given me.&quot; Kanuka 
reached out to take the photo as Kumagami continued. &quot;He was in Tokyo 
last year for the International Labor show. He took this photograph.&quot; 
Kanuka glanced down as Jamison laughed. 

The picture showed two Labors &#150; both Ingram type 98s. One was standing 
at the ready, and the other was dangling by the leg from a 
construction crane. On the ground in front of the Labors stood several 
people, whom Kanuka immediately recognized. Captain Goto stood smoking 
laconically, Asuma was shouting something at the labor &#150; or perhaps 
the crane operator, Noa was visible inside Alphonse&#39;s cockpit and 
Kumagami stood next to a command vehicle. Ota&#39;s form was clearly 
dangling from the arm of his Labor, as he futilely attempted to detach 
it from the crane &#150; an action that would have caused it to crash to 
the ground, probably killing him.

Kanuka laughed suddenly. &quot;What on earth?&quot;

Kumagami shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s Otah. Who can ever understand the whys?&quot;

Jamison, a dark-skinned man of medium build, smiled broadly, &quot;You can 
have it, Lt. Kumagami. I thought it was funny, but I expect you 
probably thought it was funnier &#150; since you work with the man and 
all.&quot;

Kumagami took the photo back and bowed towards Jamison. &quot;Thank you, 
Officer Jamison. You are very kind,&quot; she said in lightly accented 
English. Kanuka thought that the words sounded very pretty the way 
Kumagami had said them.

In a few minutes, Kanuka and Kumagami, with her new treasure tucked 
safely away in her purse, had recommenced their walk uptown. Kumagami 
asked questions about the neighborhoods through which they passed, but 
aside from a polite answer or two, Kanuka was silent.

Kumagami stopped walking. Kanuka took a few steps, then turned with a 
slightly distracted look. As if suddenly aware of the other woman, 
Kanuka&#39;s face cleared, then filled with concern. &quot;Oh! I just realized 
&#150; your feet must be killing you. Would you prefer we get a taxi?&quot;

Kumagami studied Kanuka seriously, then shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m fine, 
thank you. It&#39;s just that&#133;maybe it would be best, though, if you go 
home &#150; you seem upset.&quot;

Thoughts raced around Kanuka&#39;s mind. How much to tell this woman &#150; 
this virtual stranger? What would be polite, appropriate? She was at a 
complete loss for words. Finally, she settled on, &quot;I&#39;m sorry &#150; I have 
some things on my mind.&quot;

&quot;I can see that,&quot; Kumagami said mildly. &quot;Would you prefer to go home? 
I don&#39;t wish to be a burden.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kanuka said quickly, &quot;you&#39;re not a burden and &#133;and I&#39;d prefer to 
have some company.&quot; The admission was not an easy one. Kanuka always 
projected a smoothly competent exterior. It was not easy to admit, to 
herself or to anyone else, that occasionally, she needed help.

Kumagami stepped to the curb and lifted a hand, a piercing whistle 
falling from her lips. &quot;We&#39;ll take a taxi.&quot;
