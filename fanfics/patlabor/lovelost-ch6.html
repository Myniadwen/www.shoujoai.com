<h1>Love's Lost Labors (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../patlabor/index.html">Patlabor</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../patlabor/lovelost-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Kumagami smiling politely and attempting to engage the other cop in 
chitchat. She turned back to Kelly, only to blanch away from the 
accusing stare.

&quot;That was fast work, Kanuka,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;How long have you known 
each other?&quot;

Kanuka shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s not like that Kelly &#150; we&#39;re really just 
colleagues. I met her once before when I went back to Japan for a 
short time. She&#39;s my replacement at the Second Division.&quot;

&quot;Ah, another mech-head, then.&quot; Kelly&#39;s lips pulled back in a knowing 
smile. &quot;Don&#39;t try to pull one over on me, Kanuka. I have the gift of 
truth and you know it.&quot;

Kanuka sighed. One of the many drawbacks of life with Kelly &#150; her 
conviction that she was blessed with some supernatural power to &quot;see.&quot; 
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to do anything. We share an interest, that&#39;s all.&quot; She 
didn&#39;t state the obvious &#150; that it Kelly had never shown any interest 
in Labors, or Kanuka&#39;s work with them. Kanuka took a deep breath. 
Tonight wasn&#39;t the night to&#133;

&quot;You&#39;re leaving, aren&#39;t you?&quot; It was more a statement than a question. 
Kelly&#39;s eyes were full of hurt disappointment, but her tone was 
resigned. &quot;I&#39;ve seen it coming for a while.&quot;

Kanuka stared, her mouth open. How does one even answer something like 
that? She had never believed in Kelly&#39;s &quot;sight,&quot; but&#133;

Kelly looked back over towards Kumagami then shot a dark look at 
Kanuka. &quot;It&#39;s to be Japan, then?&quot;

Kanuka shut her mouth and cleared her throat. Keeping her voice low 
and even she said, &quot;Now&#39;s not the time to talk about it.&quot;

Kelly gave her a sad smile. &quot;Later, then. You can tell me all about 
it.&quot; She reached out a hand and squeezed Kanuka&#39;s arm briefly. &quot;Good 
night, Kanuka.&quot;

The tall redhead turned away, pasting a bright smile on her face and 
rejoined her colleagues. Kanuka took a few breaths, trying to 
determine what Kelly had meant by it all, before she also joined the 
others.

Kumagami held up a picture and waved it in Kanuka&#39;s direction. In 
English she said, &quot;Look what Officer Jamison has given me.&quot; Kanuka 
reached out to take the photo as Kumagami continued. &quot;He was in Tokyo 
last year for the International Labor show. He took this photograph.&quot; 
Kanuka glanced down as Jamison laughed. 

The picture showed two Labors &#150; both Ingram type 98s. One was standing 
at the ready, and the other was dangling by the leg from a 
construction crane. On the ground in front of the Labors stood several 
people, whom Kanuka immediately recognized. Captain Goto stood smoking 
laconically, Asuma was shouting something at the labor &#150; or perhaps 
the crane operator, Noa was visible inside Alphonse&#39;s cockpit and 
Kumagami stood next to a command vehicle. Ota&#39;s form was clearly 
dangling from the arm of his Labor, as he futilely attempted to detach 
it from the crane &#150; an action that would have caused it to crash to 
the ground, probably killing him.

Kanuka laughed suddenly. &quot;What on earth?&quot;

Kumagami shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s Otah. Who can ever understand the whys?&quot;

Jamison, a dark-skinned man of medium build, smiled broadly, &quot;You can 
have it, Lt. Kumagami. I thought it was funny, but I expect you 
probably thought it was funnier &#150; since you work with the man and 
all.&quot;

Kumagami took the photo back and bowed towards Jamison. &quot;Thank you, 
Officer Jamison. You are very kind,&quot; she said in lightly accented 
English. Kanuka thought that the words sounded very pretty the way 
Kumagami had said them.

In a few minutes, Kanuka and Kumagami, with her new treasure tucked 
safely away in her purse, had recommenced their walk uptown. Kumagami 
asked questions about the neighborhoods through which they passed, but 
aside from a polite answer or two, Kanuka was silent.

Kumagami stopped walking. Kanuka took a few steps, then turned with a 
slightly distracted look. As if suddenly aware of the other woman, 
Kanuka&#39;s face cleared, then filled with concern. &quot;Oh! I just realized 
&#150; your feet must be killing you. Would you prefer we get a taxi?&quot;

Kumagami studied Kanuka seriously, then shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m fine, 
thank you. It&#39;s just that&#133;maybe it would be best, though, if you go 
home &#150; you seem upset.&quot;

Thoughts raced around Kanuka&#39;s mind. How much to tell this woman &#150; 
this virtual stranger? What would be polite, appropriate? She was at a 
complete loss for words. Finally, she settled on, &quot;I&#39;m sorry &#150; I have 
some things on my mind.&quot;

&quot;I can see that,&quot; Kumagami said mildly. &quot;Would you prefer to go home? 
I don&#39;t wish to be a burden.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kanuka said quickly, &quot;you&#39;re not a burden and &#133;and I&#39;d prefer to 
have some company.&quot; The admission was not an easy one. Kanuka always 
projected a smoothly competent exterior. It was not easy to admit, to 
herself or to anyone else, that occasionally, she needed help.

Kumagami stepped to the curb and lifted a hand, a piercing whistle 
falling from her lips. &quot;We&#39;ll take a taxi.&quot;

 

 

Chapter 5

Both women were silent for the duration of the cab ride. Kanuka spoke 
up only when Kumagami attempted to pay for the ride. &quot;I&#39;m the host 
here &#150; I&#39;ll pay.&quot;

Kumagami bowed. &quot;Then, when you come back to Japan, it&#39;ll be my 
treat.&quot;

Her mouth shut tightly, Kanuka didn&#39;t reply.

 

In Kumagami&#39;s room, the Japanese woman was finally able to exchange 
shoes for slippers. With an exaggerated sigh she sank into a chair by 
the window. &quot;At least allow me to pour,&quot; she said and filled two 
courtesy coffee mugs with sake&#39;. She watched Kanuka closely as the 
American drank in silence.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me, you know,&quot; Kumagami said.

Kanuka looked up guiltily. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m being rude. I just had a 
small shock back there. Kelly, Officer O&#39;Toole is a friend and&#133;&quot;

&quot;And she broke up with you?&quot; Kumagami&#39;s voice was guileless. &quot;You&#39;re a 
hard woman to read, Kanuka-san, but I&#39;ve been a cop a long time.&quot;

Kanuka flushed. &quot;Our relationship ended some time ago. It&#39;s just 
that,&quot; she inhaled, held it a minute, then exhaled. &quot;I hadn&#39;t told her 
I was taking the job in Japan.&quot;

&quot;It seems like a strange place to tell one&#39;s ex-lover about a life 
change. The street I mean.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought, but I&#39;ve been thinking about it,&quot; Kanuka drank 
her sake&#39;. &quot;I think she wanted to tell me she already knew &#150; and to 
tell me that she understood.&quot;

Kumagami stood and walked across the room in response to a knock on 
the door. Room service entered with a tray. Kumagami signed the 
receipt and closed the door after the young man had left. She lifted 
the tray lid to reveal a selection of small, crustless sandwiches. 

&quot;Please, help yourself,&quot; she gestured to the plate. &quot;I hate to drink 
on an empty stomach.

Kanuka took a sandwich, but did no more than nibble on it.

&quot;So,&quot; Kumagami said pleasantly, &quot;if I may be allowed to indiscreetly 
recap. Your ex-lover used a public situation to say goodbye. Any ideas 
why?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kanuka answered automatically. &quot;Kelly&#39;s, well, Kelly&#39;s a 
passionate person. When we were together it was really good...or 
really bad. I think she preferred this way of saying good-bye so that 
it wasn&#39;t either.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; the Japanese woman wiped her mouth with a napkin, sipped more 
sake&#39; and shot Kanuka a look. &quot;Now you&#39;re free.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; And then the realization of what the other woman had just said 
hit her. Kanuka looked up pointedly. Dark eyes met dark eyes evenly. 
&quot;I&#39;m completely free.&quot; Kanuka echoed. &quot;To go wherever I want, do 
whatever I want&#133;&quot;

Kumagami never took her eyes from Kanuka&#39;s as she said quietly, &quot;Well, 
thank god for that.&quot;

Tension built within Kanuka, but she couldn&#39;t be sure - what if she 
was completely misreading this? &quot;I, uh,&quot; she began, then regrouped. 
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Kumagami set her mug of sake&#39; on the table and smiled apologetically. 
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m already feeling awkward about this &#150; I don&#39;t want to have 
to feel guilty too.&quot;

Kanuka gaped openly at the Japanese woman. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve taken psychology classes, as have I,&quot; Kumagami 
continued. &quot;You and both know that love and hate, attraction and 
repulsion are just opposite sides of the same coin.&quot; She gazed at 
Kanuka frankly. &quot;In the light of that knowledge, doesn&#39;t our previous 
encounter make more sense?&quot; She stood, pushing the short hair back 
from her ears as she paced across the floor. &quot;I snapped at you,&quot; 
Kumagami admitted, &quot;when we first met because...&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Kanuka interrupted. &quot;You don&#39;t have to continue.&quot; 

The Japanese woman leaned against the room door, arms folded across 
her chest. &quot;Well, we&#39;re both intelligent women. What do we do next?&quot;

Kanuka stood. &quot;It depends on how you define intelligence. If you 
define it as a good understand of strategic situations, knowing how to 
get in, find a target, accomplish the objective, then get out with the 
minimal amount of damage; then what we do is say good night, I go home 
to my apartment and we&#39;ll see each other tomorrow at the conference.&quot; 
She gave the other woman a little smile. 

&quot;But...?&quot; Kumagami asked with an answering smile on her face.

&quot;But,&quot; Kanuka said, &quot;not everyone defines &quot;intelligent&quot; the same way.&quot; 
She took a few steps into the center of the room. &quot;Some people might 
say that an intelligent person is one who, when faced with an 
emotionally charged situation will seek to defuse it.&quot; She took 
another step forward, watching Kumagami carefully. &quot;And of course, 
then there&#39;s native intelligence. That kind of intelligence responds 
to certain situations with a intuitive understanding of the broader 
issues between the parties &#150; with common sense, as they say.&quot; Kanuka 
stepped forward again. &quot;In all honesty, Takeo-san, I&#39;m at a loss.&quot;

Kumagami pushed off from the door. &quot;Me too,&quot; she said. &quot;Look at us, 
two intelligent women and we can&#39;t figure out a thing that would be 
obvious to the most uneducated person.&quot; She took two steps into the 
room and within touching distance of Kanuka.

Neither moved nor spoke and the tension, which had been building 
slowly, had now become a palpable presence in the room. Kanuka stared 
openly at Kumagami, noting the dark eyes, the thick, straight, black 
hair &#150; all things she had seen stare back at her from her mirror, but 
so rarely in the face of her peers. Even more, Kanuka saw in Kumagami 
a genuine dedication to the job. This was a woman who, more than 
anything else, wanted to excel as a police officer. Someone whose 
interests and desires mirrored her own &#150; in many ways. Kanuka found 
one hand poised, not quite touching the other woman&#39;s cheek.

With an iron effort of will, Kanuka breached the final inch and 
stroked the back of her hand softly along Takeo&#39;s jaw. She moved 
closer to the other woman as her hand reached Takeo&#39;s hairline, and 
her fingers brushed gently against the short strands. Kanuka could 
feel the heat in her face, and the tingling throughout her body and 
she prayed fervently that she wasn&#39;t being made a fool of.

Takeo&#39;s eyes had never left Kanuka&#39;s. The Japanese officer took 
Kanuka&#39;s shoulders in her hands and leaned forward, her lips parted 
just slightly, her eyes closed. Kanuka met the kiss and felt a wave of 
intense relief, adrenaline and excitement wash over her, leaving her 
almost too weak to stand.

They touched each other tenderly, almost delicately, as if each woman 
was afraid the other might break or, more accurately, break and run. 
What part of Kanuka&#39;s mind was not filled with skin, and tongue and 
lips was afraid, terribly afraid. She was not a promiscuous woman, her 
lovers had been few, and none of them had made her feel quite this 
terrified.

Kanuka broke away, panting, and stared at Takeo. &quot;Part of me can&#39;t 
stop screaming that this is a terrible idea. You&#39;re leaving to return 
to Tokyo in two days.&quot;

&quot;That leaves us two days,&quot; Takeo said, with irritating rationality. 
She buried one hand in Kanuka&#39;s hair and pulled them together. Her 
mouth was cool, tasting of sake&#39;. Kanuka found her arms around Takeo&#39;s 
body, digging into the lithe, muscular form. When she could no longer 
breathe, Kanuka pulled away slightly, but found herself held fast by 
Takeo&#39;s grip. The other woman was looking at her, a slight smile 
quirking the corner of her lips.

&quot;What are you afraid of?&quot; she asked. &quot;This is as much my idea as 
yours...&quot; her eyes grew wide. &quot;Will it make you feel better to know 
that you aren&#39;t the first women I&#39;ve been with?&quot; She put her hands on 
Kanuka&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Or do you need more sake&#39; before you&#39;ll relax?&quot;

Kanuka felt some of the concern drain from her body, replaced 
immediately by a different kind of tension. She threw caution to the 
wind, pressing her mouth hard against Takeo&#39;s, taking possession of 
the other woman. Takeo responded, predictably, by seizing Kanuka 
physically and attempting to assert her authority.

Clothes were literally flung off their bodies, as each struggled to 
gain control. Kanuka found herself, for a brief moment, pinned by the 
surprisingly strong Japanese woman, but slipped out of Takeo&#39;s grasp a 
moment later.

With looks of pure concentration, they wrestled for a moment, each 
seeking to dominate the other, until the Japanese woman gave a little 
half laugh and gave in. &quot;I&#39;m trying to be less competitive,&quot; she 
breathed, as Kanuka buried her face in Takeo&#39;s neck.

The American woman moaned loudly. She had never felt like this with 
anyone before &#150; never wanted to be so much a part of someone else&#39;s 
life.... With this thought, Kanuka stiffened and pulled away. That was 
why she felt fear where she never had before. 

Takeo looked up at her from half-closed eyes. &quot;Why did you stop?&quot;

Kanuka pushed her hair back from her face and shook her head. 

Takeo sat up and faced the other woman. &quot;Why?&quot; she asked simply.

Kanuka lowered her head slightly, then looked hard at Takeo, her dark 
eyes smoldering. &quot;Because I could lose myself in you. I&#39;ve never 
wanted that &#150; I&#39;ve worked hard at not losing myself in anyone. To want 
that as much as I do right now...&quot;

Takeo lifted a hand and stroked Kanuka&#39;s hair, following it down its 
length onto Kanuka&#39;s shoulder. She continued to stroke along the other 
woman&#39;s arm, until her hand met Kanuka&#39;s on the bedspread.

&quot;I could say, &#39;I&#39;m already lost,&#39; &quot; Takeo said quietly. &quot;Or, &#39;we&#39;ll 
get lost together,&#39; but both wouldn&#39;t be true.&quot;

&quot;Takeo,&quot; Kanuka said, &quot;I don&#39;t do one or two-night stands.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I.&quot; 

&quot;But you leave in two days.&quot;

Takeo leaned forward, one strap of her camisole slipping off her 
shoulder as she moved. &quot;And you&#39;ll come home to Japan soon.&quot;

Kanuka stared as the other woman&#39;s mouth moved along her shoulder 
towards her neck. Her eyes closed as Takeo&#39;s lips met her own and she 
sighed, &quot;I&#39;m going home.&quot; Her fear slipped away in sensations of warm 
skin and hands caressing her, and she smiled as she embraced Takeo 
strongly. Sliding her mouth down to Takeo&#39;s, Kanuka muttered, with a 
distinctly amused tone, &quot;I&#39;m home already.&quot;

Kanuka&#39;s thoughts ranged wildly as she stroked and kissed Takeo. It 
*was* as if they had always known each other &#150; each reaching 
unerringly for the most sensitive areas of the other&#39;s body. As Kanuka 
rained tiny kisses on the other woman&#39;s ear, she knew, almost 
instinctively, that slipping her tongue into the corner of that ear 
would drive the other woman mad. Takeo writhed in Kanuka&#39;s arms, 
gasping with the intensity of the sensation. Kanuka smiled at the 
other woman&#39;s tormented moans and turned her attention to Takeo&#39;s 
neck. Something about the skin underneath her ear made Kanuka want to 
sink her teeth into that neck. Takeo&#39;s breath was coming faster and 
faster and her hands gripped Kanuka&#39;s arms so tightly that the 
American was sure she would have dark bruises for days. Takeo&#39;s voice 
came in broken gasps, pleading Kanuka for more, to never stop and 
Kanuka obliged. With a series of whimpers and shudders, Takeo managed 
to convey a sense of urgency that Kanuka could not ignore. Never 
removing one hand from a firm nipple, or her mouth from Takeo&#39;s neck, 
she slipped her other hand lightly under the edge of soft panties, 
only to encounter even softer hair and skin. With a growl, Kanuka 
filled Takeo, biting down on the skin beneath her. As Takeo shook in 
her arms, thrashing strongly, Kanuka flicked one finger across the 
nipple, and heard, tasted and felt Takeo surrender to her.

Takeo relaxed her grip on Kanuka&#39;s arms, going limp in the other 
woman&#39;s embrace, and sighing heavily. &quot;Mmmmm,&quot; she moaned, as she 
leaned her head against the American&#39;s shoulder. &quot;That was nice.&quot;

Kanuka said nothing, but leaned down and kissed the other woman&#39;s 
forehead lightly. The first kiss was followed by a second, on Takeo&#39;s 
nose, which was followed by the lightest possible pressure on her 
lips. Takeo&#39;s eyes opened and she slid her arms around Kanuka&#39;s neck, 
her mouth opening. Kanuka kissed the corners of the other woman&#39;s 
lips, then teased them with the lightest touch of tongue. With a sigh, 
Takeo captured Kanuka&#39;s mouth and drew her in.

Takeo sat up abruptly as they kissed and leaned heavily on Kanuka 
until the other woman was forced to fall backwards onto the bed. 
Pinning Kanuka&#39;s arms lightly above her head, Takeo set out to trace 
every curve of her body with her lips. Kanuka murmured something as 
Takeo brushed her cheek across the skin of her belly.

&quot;What?&quot; Takeo asked, her mouth tasting the skin under one of Kanuka&#39;s 
breasts.

&quot;Touch me,&quot; Kanuka answered, her words becoming a moan, as the lips 
slipped around the curve of the breast, passing over the nipple. Takeo 
removed her hands from the other woman&#39;s arms, sliding down the sides 
of her torso, onto the slight curve of her hips. She sat back, 
stroking her hands softly along the muscles in the other woman&#39;s 
thighs, down past exquisite knees, and along the muscular calves. Each 
foot was held, caressed and released. Takeo looked down at Kanuka, who 
seemed oddly complacent, her eyes closed, and breathing deeply and 
slowly. The Japanese woman laid her hand once again on Kanuka&#39;s thigh. 
She slid her hand along the junction of leg and thigh, running her 
manicured nails through the thick curls of hair.

Leaning forward to whisper in Kanuka&#39;s ear, Takeo ran her fingers 
lightly between Kanuka&#39;s legs, watching her face closely. &quot;Here?&quot; she 
blew the words into Kanuka&#39;s ear, as her finger just barely stroked 
over Kanuka&#39;s clit.

The American&#39;s eyes rolled in her head. &quot;Yes,&quot; she pleaded, as fingers 
slid into her, playing with her. Kanuka began to whimper slightly, as 
Takeo bent over her, fingers playing across lips and clit. A sound 
ripped from Kanuka&#39;s throat as Takeo&#39;s tongue slid between her 
fingers. The Japanese woman laughed, as Kanuka&#39;s hands gripped her 
head, fingers entangling themselves in her short hair. She lowered her 
mouth to Kanuka&#39;s center, conscious of the sensitive body beneath her. 
It wasn&#39;t long before she was aware of a building tension in Kanuka&#39;s 
muscles. Takeo entered Kanuka, never taking her mouth from the other 
woman. Kanuka&#39;s hips lifted, and with muffled scream, came, while 
Takeo stroked her with hands and lips.

Long after Kanuka had relaxed, one hand playing with Takeo&#39;s hair, the 
Japanese woman lay on Kanuka&#39;s stomach, tracing the other woman&#39;s 
ribs.

Kanuka shifted and stretched beneath Takeo. Time and the silence 
stretched, but neither woman seemed to want to be the first to speak.

Kanuka drifted in and out of sleep, aware only of the warm body on her 
stomach, and of the feeling &#150; a feeling she hadn&#146;t known in a long 
time &#150; of pleasant comfort, happiness without reserve. Her eyes opened 
as Takeo shifted, moving to lie by her side.

&quot;When are you leaving?&quot; Kanuka asked quietly, surprised at how little 
concern she felt, how little tension filled her voice.

&quot;I was supposed to leave Monday, but seeing as there is an 
international task force liaison here in New York &#150; and seeing as the 
task force is meant o be working on Second Division&#39;s turf, I&#39;m 
applying for an extension of my trip. I think that the contacts I make 
here will be invaluable for the Patlabor unit.&quot;

Kanuka nodded. &quot;That makes sense. And seeing as my colleague from 
Japan has traveled all this way to learn about Labors as 
anti-terrorist forces, it only makes sense if I ask for some leave to 
work with her on the topic.&quot;

&quot;Mmm. Sounds like important work.&quot;

&quot;Very. Could make a big difference in almost all the major cities 
diplomatic arrangements. It will probably lead to major protocol 
changes...and training, very probably all over the world.&quot;

&quot;How exciting!&quot; Takeo rolled over and smiled. &quot;When will you come back 
to Japan?&quot; She leaned over to brush her lips across Kanuka&#39;s.

&quot;I was supposed to leave in two months, but seeing as my Japanese 
colleague is already here, I might be able to move it up a month.&quot; It 
was Kanuka&#39;s turn to kiss Takeo.

&quot;Can you make a move that quickly?&quot; Takeo asked. &quot;I mean, I have a 
large apartment, you can...you&#39;d better stay with me, but, what about 
your place?&quot;

Kanuka shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ll explain rent control to you later.&quot; She smiled, 
a genuine, happy, unreserved smile. &quot;Right now I have some very 
serious business that only you can help me with.&quot; She held out an arm 
and to her immense delight, pulled a pliable and cooperative Takeo 
into her arms.

They might only have a week together now, but weeks turn into months 
and months into years. 

Kanuka looked into Takeo&#39;s eyes, noticing the firmness, the 
uncompromising standards, the dedication and she nodded. It wasn&#39;t 
without it&#39;s challenges, but like being a cop...in the end, it was 
always worth it.

&quot;It&#39;s a lot of work,&quot; Takeo said, as if reading her mind, &quot;Labor 
units, love, life...&quot; She kissed Kanuka deeply. &quot;But that&#39;s what makes 
it worth doing.&quot;

Kanuka didn&#146;t bother answering with words.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: In Japan, no matter how long you, as a gaijin, live there, you 
will always be &quot;returning&quot; (kaeru) to your country of ethnic 
origin...even if you were born in Japan. For Kumagami to express that 
Kanuka was &quot;coming home&quot; to Japan, was to emphasize that she is a true 
Japanese...although, in fact, she is not. It was, in effect, a 
complement. An empty one, as Kanuka notes, rather wryly.
