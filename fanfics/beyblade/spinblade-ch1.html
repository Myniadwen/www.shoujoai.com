<h1>Spin, Blade, Suffering (The Three Don't Mix)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../beyblade/index.html">Beyblade</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Emily heaved a sigh.

Things had been on a low ebb for her, recently. More than 
expected for someone of such a young age. And things were going 
so well at first. The World BBA Championships had been one of 
the greatest events in recent sports history. So many awesome 
teams had competed in it. The relentless Blitzkrieg Boys, the 
hard-rocking All Starz, the resolute White Tiger X, the 
synchronized duo of F Dynasty, the 
shady-but-ultimately-good-hearted Barthez Battalion; and of 
course, the courageous BBA Revolution. And it equated to a 
tournament that had rocked the Beyblading world to no limits. It 
was quite fitting then, that it was the last major tournament 
that the BBA launched before its untimely demise. 

...Now BEGA was there to fill its shoes. 

It wasn&#39;t exactly a welcomed change-over for everyone. Most of 
the people active in the Beyblade world were generally accepting 
of this new sporting corporation. But the hardcore puritans, the 
Beyblading zealots; could see through all the momentum, glitz 
and glamour.  Those people just happened to be the world champ 
himself, Tyson, and all of his entourage. Most of the friends he 
had made during the tournament had gathered all together for the 
upcoming fight against the BEGA Five. Hence Emily&#39;s presence in 
this quiet, mountainous area. But they had work to do. The 
technically prowess of the BEGA bladers, mostly glaring of 
which; Crusher and Garland, had to be overcome somehow. And 
while Tyson and the others trained themselves to a razor&#39;s edge 
outside; Emily, Kenny and Miguel worked tirelessly to even out 
the playing field with the tech of the Beyblades. Their work had 
been a lot of time and stress. But one look at Tyson&#39;s resolves, 
fearless face pushed all others back into the game. And 
eventually; they had come up with the one trump card that they 
had to play in this match.

The Hard Metal System.

Though it was essentially Kenny&#39;s hypothesis that generated the 
overall outline for it, the HM would not have been possible with 
out Emily&#39;s engineering experience and technical know-how. Not 
to mention Miguel&#39;s added knowledge of the inner workings of the 
Beyblade in addition. The three worked at the small but mildly 
comfortable wooden shack upon the foothills where Tyson and the 
others were training. Kenny sat across from Emily with his 
laptop Dizzi at the ready, tapping into codes and pulling out 
data files to draw from. While Emily did the same at her own 
laptop, and Miguel began adjusting a prototype blade with the 
intention of testing out the Hard Metal System. 

Kenny eased back and sighed, wiping the sweat from his face. 
&quot;Whoa! This is so tiring. I haven&#39;t worked on a Beyblade so hard 
since we created the new Dragoon for battle with the Demolition 
Boys a while back.&quot;

Emily recalled those days well. But she didn&#39;t look up from 
screen of her laptop. &quot;...That was a long time ago, Kenny. And 
we still have a lot of work to do. The HM is powerful... but we 
need to substitute some of the weight we put in for enhanced 
speed. Otherwise it&#39;ll just slow Tyson down when he eventually 
faces the BEGA Bladers in the dish.&quot;

&quot;Got a point there, Emily,&quot; Miguel added, tinkering with the 
prototype, &quot;This thing definitely feels heavier than normal. 
Which might work better for Max, considering that he&#39;s primarily 
a defensive Blader. But that won&#39;t work as well for Tyson, Rei 
and Daichi.&quot;

Kenny eased on his elbows. &quot;Yeah. I guess you guys are right. 
But if we limit the overall weight of Hard Metal... you know 
what that means. It&#39;ll be so powerful that even Tyson will have 
trouble handling it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think we can even that out anymore than we have,&quot; Emily 
replied, &quot;...It&#39;ll be up to them to master Hard Metal before 
their match. And they would need a heck of a lot of time to do 
that. So we have to keep working hard. The sooner we finish all 
this, the sooner they can start practicing.&quot;

To that, Kenny and Miguel nodded. But they couldn&#39;t help notice 
that something was... up with Emily. She was never an overly 
emotional person, but she seemed more... stoic than she normally 
was. And though Miguel hadn&#39;t really known her that long, he 
knew that Emily didn&#39;t look the type to be so focused on 
something. But Kenny was the one who questioned her about it.

&quot;...Emily?&quot; He said questioningly, &quot;Is everything okay?&quot;

Again, she didn&#39;t look up from her laptop. &quot;Of course. I just 
want this done. I&#39;m okay.&quot;

Well Kenny wasn&#39;t completely prepared to believe that. But it 
wasn&#39;t like he could do anything to question her further. 
Sometimes when people were annoyed or down in the dumps, the 
best thing to do was just leave them to get on with it for a 
while. The young technician went back to tapping data in 
preparation for test runs of the Hard Metal. While Miguel soon 
went to work on the attack ring of the prototype. About ten 
minutes after they hit the drawing board, there was a loud and 
unmistakable bang upon the door. 

Kenny turned and stared at it. &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;

Miguel did the same. &quot;...Sounds like...&quot;

&quot;Go! Strata Dragoon!&quot;

The thundering sound of wood being shattered into splinters was 
soon heard. And the Daichi&#39;s amethyst tone Beyblade crashed 
straight through the wooden door of the shack. Kenny and Emily 
gasped; while Miguel ducked for cover. Strata Dragoon sliced 
over his head and smashed into the far wall of the shack, lodged 
into harder wood, still spinning in the small dent it had made. 
Miguel took a breath of relief and took a glance at the doorway. 
The door was open now. And Daichi stood it in with a sheepish 
smile on his fiery, youthful face. 

Kenny&#39;s eyebrow ticked. &quot;Daichi?! Are you out of your mind?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh!&quot; The kid upstart chuckled, &quot;...Eh... sorry &#39;bout 
that!&quot;

Just as Miguel was about to say something in counter to that, he 
caught sight of Tyson and Mariah running up to the doorway with 
urgent, annoyed looks on their faces. They stopped suddenly. 
Mariah crouched down to look at Daichi at eyelevel, with a frown 
on her cute, cat-like face. &quot;Daichi! Do you have to take 
practice matches so seriously?&quot;

&quot;Crazy hothead!&quot; Tyson barked, pressing his hand against his 
hip, &quot;You know the Chief is busy working in here!&quot;

Daichi crossed his arms and scowled, looking up at his partner 
and rival. He could handle being scolded by Mariah, but not by 
Tyson. &quot;Back off, Tyson! I&#39;m a World Champion Blader and me and 
my Strata Dragoon are gonna tear it up! If you can&#39;t keep up 
with me then that&#39;s YOUR problem!&quot;

Both Daichi and Tyson then growled angrily at each other, right 
before Daichi jumped to the far wall of the room and grabbed 
Strata Dragoon from the dent it had made in the far wall. He 
then bounced back and dashed out of wooden shack, pulling his 
brown shell-like launcher out of his pocket. The moment he got 
back out into the hills he stared back and waved his free arm at 
the two Bladers. 

&quot;Tyson! Mariah! C&#39;mon! I&#39;ll take you both on! Right here, right 
now!&quot;

The three-time champion, Tyson, scowled vividly and followed 
after the young kid who had been his partner during the 
tournament. &quot;Oh, brother. I really need to take that kid down a 
peg or two! Slow down, Daichi!&quot;

Mariah giggled gently as the two of them went back out into the 
wilderness to train. &quot;Daichi. He&#39;s so obnoxious, but so cute 
it&#39;s hard to stay angry at him, you know? He and Tyson are so 
similar too. You&#39;d think they were brothers or something.&quot;

Emily shook all that off and turned back to her laptop. &quot;...I 
guess. But we need to work now. The secret we&#39;ve been telling 
you about will be ready soon. If we can get the peace we need to 
finish it.&quot;

Though that comment wasn&#39;t harsh or harshly said, it confused 
Mariah a little bit. Emily seemed a little odd right now. And it 
had been that way ever since they had first met up again. Mariah 
looked over at Kenny and Miguel for some kind of explanation. 
The two of them just shrugged. They had no idea what was eating 
the science girl. But there was definitely something wrong 
there. Seeing this, Mariah couldn&#39;t help but think up something 
to ease her friend&#39;s problems. 

&quot;Well, you know...&quot; She began, &quot;Hilary said that we should 
probably head back into town to get something to eat. All of us. 
And lets face it, it would be nice, wouldn&#39;t it? I know that 
Gary certainly wasn&#39;t turning down the offer, either.&quot;

Miguel ran a hand through his hair. &quot;...It might not be a bad 
idea to take a break and get a fresh start later on. All this 
research and effort isn&#39;t exactly the best way to spend the 
day.&quot;

&quot;It is when you want your team to win,&quot; Kenny offered, standing 
upright, &quot;But a break might just be what we need to get 
everything we have into perspective. And to be perfectly honest, 
I&#39;d be lying if I said that I wasn&#39;t getting hungry.&quot;

Mariah pressed her hands together and giggled. &quot;Great! Then it&#39;s 
settled!&quot;

However, Emily, still staring blankly into the LSD screen of her 
laptop, spoke. And she spoke something that was the exact 
opposite of what Mariah wanted to hear. &quot;...I&#39;ll catch up with 
you guys later. I have a few more things that I want to clear up 
here.&quot; 

Which was just the reaction that Kenny was expecting. But 
neither him nor Miguel said anything to try to change her mind. 
The two young men abandoned their posts. Kenny shut down Dizzi 
then closed it; walking off to the door with Miguel. Emily 
stayed put. But then, so did Mariah. The cerise-haired Beyblader 
watched with a concerned expression, her vacant friend. There 
was something bothering Emily. And being the kind of caring 
person that she was, Mariah was both going to do something about 
it; and get to the bottom of it. She instantly went for one of 
the chairs that surrounded the lengthy table that the American 
girl was at. Then shoved that chair into the small gap next to 
Emily. Emily then looked upwards and saw the cheerful Mariah 
take a seat next to her, brandishing one of her hauntingly 
beautiful smiles.

&quot;So. What are we working on?&quot; The Asian woman asked. 
 
Emily blinked, adjusting her glasses. &quot;...Weren&#39;t you... going 
with them...?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;d rather stay here. With you.&quot;

Though Mariah meant that with the best possible intention, all 
Emily saw of it was another distraction from her work. She 
quickly turned back to her laptop and got back to work, the 
planning for the prototype of a Dragoon that was armed with the 
Hard Metal System. But that was not enough for Mariah. Something 
was most definitely wrong and she was more than sure that she 
was going to figure out what it was.

And sometimes, the best way to do that was try the direct 
approach. &quot;Is something bothering you, Emily?&quot;

&quot;...No.&quot; She replied mechanically. 

Mariah narrowed her eyes. &quot;You could have fooled me.&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not,&quot; The pink-haired girl replied, &quot;...You hardly said 
a word when we all met up again. Rick, Michael and Eddie might 
not be able to see it... but I can. And I&#39;m not going anywhere 
until you tell me what&#39;s worrying you. So did something happen? 
Did you have an argument? Is it about the All Starz or that 
woman you work for? What&#39;s her name... um... Judy?&quot;

Emily&#39;s shoulders jerked with the mention of Max&#39;s mother. And 
suddenly Mariah was aware of the problem. Or at least the source 
of it. &quot;...It&#39;s about Miss Judy, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Emily said nothing.

&quot;...Did you two have an argument?&quot;  Mariah asked, &quot;...I know 
that it might be not be easy if you did, but we White Tigers 
worked everything out with Rei. If we can heal over something 
like THAT, then I&#39;m sure that you could-&quot;

And finally, Emily let loose a worthy blast of emotion. &quot;It&#39;s 
not that simple!&quot; 

In that instant, Mariah was silenced. Finally Emily was 
beginning to open up. But this had uncovered the fact that 
Emily&#39;s problem... was far more serious than Mariah would have 
expected. Whatever was going on, she was using all this work as 
a way of running from it. Just like Mariah, Lee, Gary and Kevin 
had all run away from the realities of Rei&#39;s choice to spread 
his wings. Mariah knew first hand, what it was like to bury your 
head in the sand. And everything it happened... the simple fact 
of the matter was always proven. No matter what you try to run 
away from...

...It always catches up with you in the end.

&quot;...It&#39;s not that simple...&quot; Emily repeated, finally casting her 
eyes away from the laptop, &quot;...And I can&#39;t say anything... more. 
You guys... you guys will... hate me...&quot;

Mariah blinked in confusion. &quot;Hate you? Why would we hate you?&quot;

To be perfectly honest, Mariah and Emily were not the closest of 
friends but the friendship they did have was solid. And enough 
to make it valuable to Emily&#39;s heart. Just as it was with Max, 
Michael, Eddie and (to a lesser extent) Rick. &quot;...I love her...&quot;

&quot;...Who?&quot;

&quot;...Judy,&quot; Emily said, &quot;...I love her. I know you&#39;ll think that 
it&#39;s weird. But it doesn&#39;t feel that way to me. Not in the 
least. To me... it feels as natural as breathing or walking or 
talking. But I won&#39;t blame you if you can&#39;t understand.&quot;

Oh she understood. Mariah understood in a greater depth than 
Emily was giving her credit for. And if she had been paying more 
attention, Emily would have noticed that Mariah&#39;s mood became 
downcast at the mention of those feelings. Feelings  that were 
being cast in an opposite direction to where they were wanted. 
And needed. Mariah pulled a sad smile onto her face and tried to 
speak up a bit. Emily was hurting. That was all that mattered.

&quot;I understand,&quot; She offered, &quot;I really do. I&#39;m sorry, Emily.&quot;

Emily lowered her face. She was through with crying. But not 
through being sad about her plight. &quot;...She told me that she saw 
me as a friend. But that it couldn&#39;t work. She loves Max&#39;s Dad. 
And she made the logical point of stating the age gap between 
the two of us. In her eyes it just wasn&#39;t practical. And I know 
she&#39;s right... but that doesn&#39;t stop it from hurting. I just 
can&#39;t stop thinking about her. How strong and commanding and 
warm she is. Even if she doesn&#39;t love me back... I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ll ever get over her.&quot;

Again, Mariah&#39;s smile fell. &quot;...It... does get easier over 
time... you know...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve spent a whole month telling myself that. And it still 
doesn&#39;t feel any better.&quot;

&quot;...Oh, listen to yourself,&quot; Mariah prodded, &quot;...Are just gonna 
stamp &#39;done&#39; on your forehead and give up? You&#39;re so smart and 
pretty and kind... you could have anybody you want! Just come 
with us and take a break from all this! You&#39;ll feel lots better 
if you do, I promise!&quot;

Emily sighed to herself. &quot;...Look, Mariah. I know you&#39;re trying 
to make me feel better. And I appreciate that. But I&#39;m just not 
in the mood to be out there with everyone right now. Maybe 
later.&quot;

But later was not on Mariah&#39;s agenda. A sharp look of 
determination passed over Mariah&#39;s feline features. There was no 
way she was going to let this one get away. Mariah quickly stood 
upright and grabbed Emily by the arm, dragging her towards the 
door. 

Emily struggled with surprise. &quot;Mariah? What are you doing?!&quot;

The pink-haired teen looked back at her friend. &quot;You&#39;ve got your 
Beyblade on you, right?&quot;
 
Emily nodded to that, but only out of reflex. Then Mariah 
continued dragging Emily to the door. On the way out, she 
grabbed a spare launcher. Then the two of them marched out into 
the beautifully green foothills where everyone had been 
training. By now the others had gone for something to eat like 
Hilary had suggested. Mariah and Emily were alone up her now. 
Free to speak about things. And free to do something that Mariah 
had planned. 

The only female member of the White Tiger X Team released her 
hold on Emily&#39;s arm and then walked away from her. Once a good 
distance of around twenty metres had been put between the two of 
them, Mariah tossed the launcher at her friend with a serious 
expression on her normally cute face. 

Emily caught the launcher and blinked. &quot;...What is this all 
about, Mariah...?&quot;

She was about to find out. Mariah reached into her back pocket 
and yanked out her sleek pink Beyblade, adorned with the chip of 
her own personal Bit Beast, Galux. &quot;A Bey-Battle! Just you and 
me, one-on-one, no Bit Beasts! If I lose, you can sit in that 
shed all day and mope about something you can&#39;t fix. But if I 
win, and you battle like the Emily I remember... then you&#39;ll 
come out with me and the others!&quot;

Emily sweatdropped. &quot;...Are you serious...?&quot;

&quot;...Before we met... I went through something I still regret to 
this day. Rei was a member of my village. And when he earned the 
power of the White Tiger Bit Beast, Driger, he left us to go 
experience more of the world. My team and I hated him from then 
on. We felt like he had betrayed us. And when we faced off with 
the Bladebreakers in the Asian Tournament; I had the greatest 
match of my life with him. I learned that... no matter how much 
I hated Rei for abandoning us... I could never turn my back on 
his friendship. I had to accept that what he did was best for 
him. And know that one day he would come back with all the 
knowledge he gained and lead us to victory. Even though White 
Tiger X didn&#39;t win the last Tournament... we became a true team 
thanks to Rei. He taught us what it meant to know teamwork and 
to strengthen that teamwork with the bonds we share as friends. 
And as your friend, Emily, I won&#39;t let you waste away in there! 
I know it&#39;s hard... but my friends mean too much to me to let 
them stew in their own unhappiness. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m 
challenging you!&quot;

There was absolutely no way Emily could do this. She hadn&#39;t 
actively Bey Battled in months. &quot;...Mariah...&quot;

But the cat-like girl was far beyond talking now. Mariah 
attached Galux to the underside of her launcher and then aimed 
at the centre of space between herself and Emily. She had lots 
of experience Beyblading in the outdoors back at her village. 
Now she&#39;d put that into practice. With one powerful yank, Mariah 
pulled the cord from her launcher. &quot;Let it rip!&quot; 

And a now spinning Galux was shot into the grassy ground below. 
The pink Beyblade spun repeatedly in the spot at which Mariah 
had launched it. It began waking dust as it remained stationary; 
waiting for Mariah&#39;s next action. And Mariah was waiting for 
Emily. 

&quot;Well then?&quot; She prodded sharply, &quot;Are you going to Bey Battle 
or run away?&quot;

Emily knew Mariah too well. There was no way she was going to 
let his drop. And though she didn&#39;t have her normal Squash 
Racquet Launcher on her, the substitute that Mariah and thrown 
at her would have to do for now. Emily sighed and went into the 
pocket of her white scientist smock. Then pulled out her own 
Beyblade, the underrated yet not underpowered Trygator. She 
attached it to the base of the launcher.

The click of metal indicated that it was properly attached. 
&quot;...If I win this... do you promise to just let the issue drop?&quot; 

Mariah nodded with a confident grin. &quot;I will. But you&#39;re not 
going to win!&quot;

Though she really was in no mood for a Bey Battle, if it meant 
letting this whole thing being put to rest then she would have 
to fight... &quot;Let it rip!&quot;

Emily stood her ground and pulled the cord straight out of the 
launcher. Trygator was blasted from the launcher just a quick 
second later, and thrown straight into action with Galux. The 
aqua green Beyblade span right towards the pink one, slicing up 
the blades of grass in its away. Mariah saw this coming a mile 
away. Galux swerved to one side of the blade and avoided the 
flat-out attack without any effort whatsoever. 

Emily&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;...What...?&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;ve gotten slow since our last match, Emily,&quot; Mariah 
claimed, &quot;...that kind of an attack won&#39;t stand a chance against 
my Galux!&quot;

That sudden burst of momentum had its weight on the battle. 
Galux shot forth with great, searing speed. It collided with 
Trygator and knocked the Beyblade off its current spot. Emily 
gasped when her blade was sent straight into the air with the 
force of it. Though she managed to compose herself a little as 
Trygator began descent. It touched upon the grass of the 
foothill a brief few seconds later. Still in the game, but now 
Emily was far more cautious. Her data would have suggested that 
such an attack was normally too powerful to have come from speed 
over strength Beyblader like Mariah. Especially since that was 
NOT her special attack. So then why?

Emily tightened her fist. &quot;...That&#39;s... amazing...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve improved since we last battled each other,&quot; Mariah put 
forth, &quot;Training with hardcore bladers like Lee and Gary is the 
best way to do it. But you haven&#39;t improved... at all. Or have 
you? Have you lost your edge or are you letting your feelings 
for Miss Judy control you?&quot;

&quot;...What&#39;s... that supposed to mean?&quot; Emily questioned.  

&quot;...I remember what happened at the World Championships, all 
that time ago. I remember that Kai left the Bladebreakers and he 
joined with the Demolition Boys. I remember when he stole 
Trygator and all the other Bit Beasts from the All Starz. I&#39;ll 
never forget the tears I saw in your eyes when that happened. 
And when I failed to stop Kai myself, I couldn&#39;t stop blaming 
myself for letting you down. But I won&#39;t let you down this time! 
It&#39;s time to show you everything I&#39;ve learned since then! Galux! 
Attack!&quot;

The pink Beyblade soon moved into action. It zoomed across the 
grass and went right for Emily&#39;s Trygator. The American girl was 
so startled by the speed of this oncoming assault that she 
froze, unable to think of what to do. Galux then smashed against 
the circular blade once more. But rather than knocking it away,  
Galux rebounded off it and launched itself into the air. Once it 
reached a peak in the air, Mariah concentrated and prepared 
for...

&quot;Now, Galux! Aerial Cat Scratch!&quot;

Emily was shocked. &quot;...Aerial...?!&quot;

Streaks of powerful, sleek pink lightning energy surrounded the 
blade. It came careening downwards at one hell of a violent 
trajectory, the attack ring aiming downwards vertically. The 
Aerial Cat Scratch landed straight to the spinning Trygator. If 
that hit her, it was game over. Emily acted on nothing on 
instinct and began evasive actions. A second later; Galux 
slammed directly into the ground. Both girls covered their faces 
as the force of the attack conjured up a cloud of thick dust. 
But Emily was the one most confused by it. Mariah really had 
improved. The Aerial version of the Cat Scratch might not have 
been as forceful as the ordinary one, but to attack from above 
like that was absolutely amazing. Once the dust began to 
settle... two Beyblades were revealed. Both were spinning. But 
they were now spinning in a relatively shallow and circular 
crater. It was around a metre and a half wide and about twenty 
centimetres deep. A reflection of the power that Mariah had at 
her fingertips. She might not have been as strong as Gary or as 
well-rounded as Lee; but her agility more than made up for it. 

A smile finally came to Emily&#39;s face. &quot;...You really have gotten 
better...&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mariah nodded, grinning at the fact that Emily at last 
pulled a smile, &quot;...I&#39;m not just a pretty face, after all.&quot;

Now the Beyblading spirit was beginning to awaken inside of 
Emily. &quot;...Understood. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to roll 
over and let you win this, Mariah! Trygator! Attack now!&quot;

At long last Emily was making a serious, aggressive 
counterattack. The Beyblade with the circular base made a b-line 
for Galux in a straight up attack. Mariah met Emily&#39;s new surge 
of adrenalin with one of her own. Galux rushed towards the now 
attacking Trygator. The two blades crashed into each other and 
held one and other to a stalemate. As they span against each 
other, friction began to burn at the point of collision. 
Trygator&#39;s defences were too strong for Galux to knock it out of 
an attack. And Trygator&#39;s defences weren&#39;t enough to repel Galux 
in the way that Emily would have wanted it to. The two continued 
to hold each other at bay until they both made one last push. 
Trygator and Galux rebounded off each other and were thrown 
outside of the crater. Both Beyblades landed with full spin, and 
circled out of the vicinity of the crater. Finding a separate 
open space to continue things. Or rather, end them.

Emily pulled an even deeper smile and got ready. &quot;...That&#39;s it! 
Lets see how you deal with this! Go Trygator! Attack at Full 
Power!&quot;

The trails of dust beneath Trygator that were generated when it 
span increased. Though there was no Bit Beast action in this 
match, Emily was going all out. Something that Mariah had been 
hoping for since the start. The pink-haired cutie swung one of 
her arms to the side and yelled out;

&quot;Let&#39;s meet &#39;um head-on, Galux! Cat Scratch Attack!&quot;

That streaky, pinkish lightning energy encircled Mariah&#39;s 
Beyblade. Then it shot forth with all the power and speed that 
she could muster. The two Beyblades zeroed in on each other and 
then collided, full force, Emily&#39;s Trygator with Mariah&#39;s Galux. 
Another explosion came about from the clash. A small rumbled 
echoed beneath their feet. Dust was spread outwards from the 
point of impact be the force of the collision. Mariah and Emily 
stepped back to maintain balance and keep an eye on their 
Beyblades at the same time. And when the dust and sliced up 
grass began to settle, a newer crater had been cleaved. But 
larger and deeper than the first one. Two Beyblades were 
revealed again. 

But neither one was spinning.

Emily&#39;s shoulders slumped. &quot;...It&#39;s a... draw...?&quot;

But while Emily was mystified, Mariah was smiling to no end. The 
young woman skipped across the divide of space between herself 
and her friend. On the way there, she picked up her Galux and 
Emily&#39;s Trygator. A few moments later they were face to face 
again. Mariah tilted her head to the side and peered into 
Emily&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re heart&#39;s pounding, right?&quot; She asked, &quot;Whether you admit 
it or not, that was a lot of fun! I bet it was more fun than you 
though you could have ever since that thing with Miss Judy.&quot;

Well that was pretty blunt. But Mariah wasn&#39;t too far off in 
that respect. For a while there, she did forget about her 
troubles. And Emily realized that this was Mariah&#39;s true 
intention all along. To motivate her. 

The Asian girl then pressed Trygator in Emily&#39;s hands. &quot;Here. I 
think this belongs to you. If you keep practicing, you&#39;ll be as 
good as me one day! And to be honest, I love battling with other 
girls. You know what it&#39;s like being on a team full of guys too, 
right?&quot;

After taking one look at Trygator, locked in her palm, she cast 
another look up at Mariah. But this time she was smiling again. 
&quot;...Yeah. Thanks, Mariah.&quot;

The pink-haired woman blushed and dipped the toe of her shoe 
into the ground, almost bashfully. &quot;...Yeah... well... I just 
don&#39;t want you to think that if Miss Judy doesn&#39;t like you 
back... then that&#39;s the end of it. There are... other people out 
there who like you... that way.&quot;

Emily chuckled pessimistically. &quot;...Like who?&quot;

There was a second of silence between the two of them. Though 
that was a rhetorical question in nature, Mariah had an answer 
for it. The slightly shorter girl leaned towards Emily and 
pursed her lips, pressing a sweet little kiss against the 
American girl&#39;s cheek. Emily&#39;s eyes widened with surprise when 
Mariah stepped back from her butterfly kiss, and slotted Galux 
into her back pocket.

Blushing, she spoke. &quot;They&#39;re around, Emily. You just haven&#39;t 
noticed them.&quot;

With that said and done, Mariah stepped back and dashed down the 
hill to catch up with the others. Expecting Emily to follow her. 
Emily blinked once and touched upon her left cheek. The one that 
Mariah had kissed. And after a second of indecision, she smiled 
dreamily and followed after her friend. Heartbreak is never 
easy...

...But it does get better.

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* My first Beyblade fic. I&#39;ve been a fan of this series for a 
while but I&#39;ve never written a fic on it until now. I was 
originally against the idea of a Mariah/Emily fic in the past, 
but I just woke up one morning, watched the match between Kai 
and Tyson in G Revolution and it suddenly seemed like a good 
idea to give it a try. They are strangely cute together; it&#39;s 
more than likely that I&#39;ll take another shot at this pairing in 
the future.

* I commented somewhere that Emily and Mariah had a match during 
the first Beyblade series. I can&#39;t remember if they did or they 
didn&#39;t, but for the purpose of adding an element of familiarity 
in their match, I simply assumed that they did. If it breaks the 
canon then I apologize. But this a fanfiction after all. When it 
comes to fanfics, the canon is meant to be broken!
