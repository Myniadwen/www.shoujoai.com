<h1>Do You Hate Me?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../avatar/index.html">Avatar the Last Airbender</a>

<pre>&quot;Katara?&quot;

Katara looked away from the starry sky and turned to the young 
black-haired girl who called her. &quot;Toph...are you okay?&quot; Toph frowned 
and stared at the sand for while. That was when Katara noticed the red 
mark on her left cheek.

&quot;Oh my god! Toph, how did-&quot; Katara began, but then she immediately 
realized who must have done it. &quot;Did...Aang do this?&quot; Toph broke into 
tears and Katara pulled her into a hug. &quot;It&#39;ll be okay...Aang&#39;s just a 
little pissed right now. I&#39;ll make sure he won&#39;t hurt you...&quot; Katara 
whispered as she stroked Toph&#39;s soft hair.

Toph looked up at Katara with shimmering white eyes and smiled. Katara 
blushed and thought, &#39;She&#39;s beautiful...damn it, why am I thinking these 
sick things?&#39; Toph stopped crying and muttered something too quiet for 
Katara to hear. &quot;W-What was that?&quot; asked Katara as she quickly snapped 
out of her fantasies about the young Earth-Bender.

Toph took a deep breath and whispered, &quot;Do you hate me?&quot; Katara looked 
at Toph in bewilderment and said, &quot;Of course not! 
You&#39;re...you&#39;re...special to me...&quot; Toph suddenly kissed Katara on the 
lips and said, &quot;You&#39;re special to me, too...&quot; Katara snapped out of the 
shock and curled up closer to Toph. &quot;Sleep tight...&quot;

That morning, Sokka woke up and saw Katara and Toph sleeping on top of 
each other: a smile on both their faces. Sokka thought he was dreaming, 
so he went back to sleep. Suddenly, a voice shouted, &quot;Damn it! Damn it! 
Damn it!&quot;

Sokka turned his head and watched in silence as Aang formed small 
tornadoes and sent them in different directions while shouting every 
curse word he knows to the sky. When Aang noticed that Toph and Katara 
were still asleep, he threw a rock at Toph&#39;s face to wake them up. As 
the rock collided with Toph&#39;s face, blood spurt out of her nose. Katara 
screamed and shouted, &quot;TOPH!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s what you get, bitch!&quot; Aang 
exclaimed as he watched Katara wipe Toph&#39;s nose.

&quot;Aang, what the fuck is wrong with you?&quot; Katara shouted. &quot;WHAT&#39;S WRONG 
WITH ME? WHY DON&#39;T YOU ASK THAT DAMN BITCH! THIS IS HER FAULT!&quot; Aang 
cried. He pointed accusingly at Toph and she began to cry again. Sokka 
was ready to wack Aang in the place where the sun don&#39;t shine, but the 
Avatar just sighed and flew off with his glider.

Katara hugged Toph and kissed her on the lips, telling her that it&#39;ll be 
okay... 
 

Toph sighed and looked out into the vast desert. It had been hours since 
they started walking again. Toph&#39;s nose was still clogged up after Aang 
threw a rock at her face. She stared in the direction of Katara&#39;s back 
in silence for a while. &#39;Damn it!&#39; Toph thought, &#39;How could I love a 
girl that I can&#39;t even see! I want to see Katara so badly...&#39; Suddenly, 
something hard and painful knocked her back into reality.

&quot;TOPH!&quot; Katara spun around and saw Aang punch Toph hard on the side of 
her face. &quot;Wake up, bitch!&quot; Aang shouted as he also kicked Toph&#39;s side. 
Toph hugged herself for protection and begged Aang to stop. She would 
have used Earth-Bending, but the sand didn&#39;t work well with her.

Katara quickly opened a small bottle of water she was saving and slapped 
Aang hard using the Water Whip technique. Katara then ran over to help 
Toph. Katara used some water to clean the blood and kissed her again. 
Aang was about to hit Katara when Sokka jumped on him and held his 
Boomerang against Aang&#39;s neck and hissed, &quot;You better cut it out, or 
else...&quot; Aang kicked Sokka aside and walked ahead, telling the others to 
hurry up. Sokka hugged his stomach in pain and glared angrily at Aang. 
&#39;One of these days...&#39;

Toph could feel Katara&#39;s heart beat as the Water-Bender girl hugged her 
tightly. Toph smiled and let the sound of her lover&#39;s heart calm her...

&#39;I want to see you...I want to see you so badly...I love you so much, 
but...I can only feel your soft touch and your wonderful kiss. I want to 
see you so much...I want to see how beautiful you are...&#39; </pre>
