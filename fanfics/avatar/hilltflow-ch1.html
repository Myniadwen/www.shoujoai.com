<pre>&quot;Ty Lee, this is so stupid.&quot;
 
&quot;Come on, you haven&#39;t even given it a chance yet!&quot; Ty Lee happily dragged her reluctant 
friend further up the hill. &quot;Trust me, Azula, this is just what you need.&quot;
 
&quot;I need to be fixing what&#39;s wrong with my firebending!&quot; Azula groaned. &quot;I know what 
everyone&#39;s trying to do and it&#39;s not going to work.&quot;
 
&quot;Now now, you remember what the physician said,&quot; Ty Lee scolded. &quot;No more firebending until 
you&#39;re all better.&quot;
 
&quot;And that&#39;s another thing, I&#39;m sick of everyone treating me like I&#39;m recovering from some 
really terrible sickness,&quot; Azula said.
 
&quot;Well, you kind of are,&quot; Ty Lee said. &quot;Ah, and here we are! Isn&#39;t it beautiful, Azula?&quot;
 
&quot;I guess it&#39;s nice, if you enjoy that sort of thing,&quot; Azula sighed, sitting down on a patch 
of grass that looked dry enough.
 
&quot;How could you not?&quot; Ty Lee plucked a fire lily from the ground. &quot;It&#39;s so peaceful, you can 
see for miles and miles and the flowers are just bursting and alive with color...&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s...it&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Azula said. &quot;So we just sit here and look at the flowers all 
afternoon?&quot;
 
&quot;I was hoping we could, y&#39;know, talk a little.&quot; Ty Lee sat down beside the princess and 
nonchalantly tucked the flower behind her ear. &quot;But if you&#39;d rather sit and look at the 
flowers that&#39;s okay too!&quot;
 
Azula blushed, reaching up to poke her new accessory.
 
&quot;And how is this supposed to help me again?&quot;
 
&quot;The physician said the best cure for your condition is spending time with someone who loves 
you, that&#39;s how!&quot; Ty Lee said, and kissed her before she could make any further protests.
