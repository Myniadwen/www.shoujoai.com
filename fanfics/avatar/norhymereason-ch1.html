<pre>&quot;I hate getting wet,&quot; Mai groaned as she wrung the last of the water from her clothes. Ty 
Lee nodded sympathetically, flipping her still-damp braid back over her shoulder.
 
&quot;We&#39;d better go find Azula,&quot; she said. &quot;She&#39;s probably wondering what&#39;s taking us so long 
to fight off the Waterbender and the cute guy!&quot;
 
&quot;She can handle all four of them with one hand tied behind her back,&quot; Mai said, leaning 
back against a tree. &quot;You can go after her if you like, but I&#39;m tired of chasing those kids 
every which way. We haven&#39;t slept since the night before last.&quot; She yawned as if to 
emphasize her point.
 
&quot;Nah, you&#39;re right. Azula&#39;s more than capable,&quot; Ty Lee said. &quot;I&#39;ll stay here with you!&quot; She 
sat down beside Mai and leaned against her arm. &quot;Hey, Mai?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot;
 
And then Ty Lee was kissing her. Completely out of nowhere, with no provocation or warning. 
Just...kissing her. Mai&#39;s eyes widened and she froze, trying to decide whether she should 
pull away or not. Ty Lee finally pulled back and frowned.
 
&quot;You&#39;re supposed to kiss back,&quot; she scolded.
 
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Mai asked. &quot;I mean...you like boys.&quot;
 
&quot;So?&quot;
 
&quot;So...if you like boys, why-&quot; And then it came to her. &quot;I get it. Your chasing after a 
differeny boy everywhere we go is a coverup for your raging desire for me, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
 
Ty Lee looked at her like a confused animal, then giggled. Apparently that wasn&#39;t it after 
all.
 
&quot;You are so silly, Mai! I kissed you because you&#39;re pretty, you&#39;re my best friend and I 
felt like it.&quot; It was Ty Lee logic in its purest form, and Mai couldn&#39;t help but smile.
 
&quot;So how long before Azula actually gets worried and comes looking for us?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;I think we have a while,&quot; Ty Lee said. &quot;And you owe me, if you know what I mean.&quot; She 
leaned in and pressed her lips against Mai&#39;s, and this time Mai gladly kissed back.
