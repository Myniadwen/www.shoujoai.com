fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;So?&quot; Ty Lee prompted as they walked back to the beach house. &quot;How did it go with Chan? Was 
he totally won over by your incredible charms?&quot;
 
&quot;Why, naturally. He could barely resist me on that balcony...actually, he kissed me,&quot; Azula 
gloated.
 
&quot;Oooh, a kiss!&quot; Ty Lee squealed. &quot;Then what happened?! Did he want to go off alone somewhere 
and that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t come back to the party?&quot;
 
Azula gave a deflated sigh.
 
&quot;No, actually, he kind of freaked out and ran away,&quot; she confessed. Ty Lee frowned.
 
&quot;Aww, but why would he do that?&quot; she asked, Azula blushed and looked at her feet.
 
&quot;I...kinda told him we could dominate the world together. With my hands full of fire,&quot; she 
mumbled.
 
&quot;Well, yeah, that would definitely kill the mood!&quot; Ty Lee said. Azula glared at her.
 
&quot;It&#39;s fine, though. I don&#39;t need some stupid boy&#39;s attention anyway!&quot; she said, just like 
she always had every time a boy she liked or whom her father wanted to betroth her to ran 
away screaming. &quot;Sure, he&#39;s rich and handsome and influential, but I&#39;m the Fire Nation&#39;s 
beloved princess.&quot;
 
Ty Lee only nodded. She was a good, loyal friend, always listening to and agreeing with 
Azula. Not like Mai, who would rather be with Zuko...just like mother.
 
&quot;Azula?&quot; Ty Lee said after a long silence.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d rule the world by your side,&quot; she whispered, bringing a hand up to stroke Azula&#39;s face; 
Azula had never been more grateful for the darkness as it hid the fierce blush spreading 
rapidly across her face. &quot;You&#39;ve always been my queen, anyway...sweet sugar cakes.&quot;
