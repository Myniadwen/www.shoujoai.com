<h1>Warmth in the Winter Chill</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../avatar/index.html">Avatar the Last Airbender</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She didn&#39;t know where her feelings for Mai had come from, or why she would even have them. 
All she knew was that they were stronger than anything she&#39;d felt before.
 
Katara had known Mai since they were children, but they were from two different worlds, Mai 
the daughter of a politician and Katara the daughter of a proud middle-class family. Mai 
went to private school, Katara to a smaller public school. Mai made it into Ba Sing Se 
Academy due to her father&#39;s connections, Katara had gotten there on a scholarship.
 
But such differences meant nothing to Katara. All she saw when she looked at Mai was a 
goddess. Pale skin, raven-black hair that fell past her waist and piercing golden eyes that 
looked at the world with an odd mix of amusement and apathy. Just to walk beside such a 
girl was a privilege...no, an honor in and of itself.
 
And it wasn&#39;t even as though Mai minded. She didn&#39;t seem to understand Katara&#39;s constant 
gestures of friendship, but she clearly appreciated them in her own subdued way. And though 
every day Katara&#39;s feelings for her grew, she doubted her ability to voice them to Mai out 
of concern for what the girl would think.
 
One day as they were walking home from school, she decided to take that risk. After all, 
what was the worst that could happen? Katara cleared her throat, but to her annoyance the 
words wouldn&#39;t form and all that came out was a squeak. Mai stopped in her tracks, a hint 
of amusement in her golden gaze.
 
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course, sempai! I...well, there&#39;s something I want to talk to you about,&quot; Katara said. 
Mai put a hand on her shoulder, and Katara&#39;s heart fluttered.
 
&quot;Squeak up, then,&quot; she teased, and Katara blushed. When Mai did show her more light-hearted 
side it was usually to tease someone.
 
&quot;Well...I know we&#39;ve only been friends since the beginning of the term, but...&quot; She dug her 
hands into the pockets of her school uniform. &quot;I&#39;ve always thought you were...well, 
beautiful! Talented, smart, mysterious, even when we were only children and I only saw you 
in passing from across the street!&quot;
 
A blush spanned Mai&#39;s pale cheeks, and Katara took that as a good sign.
 
&quot;The truth is, I...&quot; She grasped Mai&#39;s hands in her own. &quot;S-sempai...I&#39;ve fallen in love 
with you,&quot; she whispered, then looked away, scared to see the other girl&#39;s reaction.
 
&quot;Katara.&quot; A warm hand caressed her cheek, and Katara felt warm all over despite the cold.
 
&quot;Sempai...?&quot; But Mai&#39;s only answer was the soft press of her lips against Katara&#39;s own. 
They stood there in the middle of the walkway, the chilled winter air and blowing bits of 
dead leaves surrounding them, lost to everything but each other.
