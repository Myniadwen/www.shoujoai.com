<h1>The Past of Today and Hope of the Tomorrow</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fushigi/index.html">Fushigi Yuugi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shangrila.html">Shangri-La</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author Notes: This is a shoujo ai fic I guess. Um...it&#39;s placed right 
after Miaka is captured at Kotou (I forget how to spell it...heh...). 
I guess that would mean Miaka is in the dungeon. Please read and 
review. And I don&#39;t really care if I get flamed. Whatever... 
Shangri-la out for now.

------------------------------------------------------------

Miaka even now I feel the emptiness. The one that came upon me, when I 
heard you say to Tamahome the reason you came back. That it was to be 
with him. Because you were in love with him. 

You know all this time I&#39;ve been trying to get Tamahome to love me, 
it&#39;s really just a game. I want you to hate him. I miss you. . . I 
miss the way things used to be. Me and you, together always. I figured 
out long ago what I feel for Tamahome is not real. It&#39;s just what you 
felt when I was reading the book. The first page said the one who 
reads the books will experience the same things as the priestess.

Just like I felt the cut on your leg, you falling and almost drowning, 
when you got that fever, and also when you stabbed yourself in the 
heart. I felt what you feel towards him. What you felt towards 
everyone of the people you met. I felt the anxiaty when you couldn&#39;t 
find me. I felt everything Miaka.

So this is what became of me, an empty shell. Without you, and the 
possiblity of your love, I don&#39;t care what happens anymore. I don&#39;t 
even care that Nakago manipulates me. The fool is blind, if he can&#39;t 
see I don&#39;t care anymore.

I nearly crumbled, you know? When I caught you in the garden waiting 
for Tamahome so you could save him. I almost crumbled because of the 
sad look on your face. I would do anything for you and only you . . . 
but you love another.

Perhaps if I told you this you may understand. Or pretend you do, then 
rush head first into things you don&#39;t understand, just like always. 

Why not me? Why? I didn&#39;t mind it before, when we were just friends in 
our own world. I could stand just being you friend. I can&#39;t now, 
because of what happened. Of what happened to me here. I needed you, I 
still need you. Yet it is him, you are trying to save. Do you know how 
much that hurts. Well this is to the hurt. *HAHAHAHAA* I can&#39;t FEEL 
anything, anymore. Nothing but the slow throb of pain in that place 
you used to occupy in my heart. Not just that one place, but the 
entire of my heart, it was yours. Probably still is, can&#39;t tell 
anymore. To speak truth, I don&#39;t want to know, because if I am ever 
repaired, if it still belongs to you, I&#39;m afraid I already know what&#39;s 
going to happen.

I&#39;ve looked over my past. I&#39;ve noticed some thing. I&#39;ve noticed that 
life is a vicious circle to be forever repeated. I only wish that 
things did not happen they way they did. I wish . . . I wish I had 
told you the way I felt before this happened. I&#39;ve known for so long.

Miaka. . .

------------------------------------------------------------

Yui . . . Why did you decide to become my enemy? My best friend, 
that&#39;s who you were and still are. My only hope it seems is to find 
the seven stars of Suzaku. So that I can have my wishes come true.

I remember the simple wishes that I had wanted when Hotohori first 
told me about Suzaku, and what it meant to become the priestess. There 
was one wish that I didn&#39;t say out loud. One that I still hold tight, 
hoping beyond hope, will come true. I don&#39;t think it can now. At 
least, not on its own.

Oh why am I so stupid? Why did I have to fall in love with Tamahome? 
But even worse why do you think I betrayed you, that I hate you?

Is it because I told Tamahome that I love him? It&#39;s not my fault that 
I love him. I love him like I love Hotohori, Nuriko, Chichiri, Tasuki, 
and Chiriko. Only I had a crush on him for a while. It&#39;s not my fault 
everyone sees it as true love. And all because I ran into a situation 
with out thinking again. 

Yui-chan I love you, why do you hate me? I wish I could tell you that 
you can have Tamahome if you want. I&#39;m only trying to save him because 
he IS one of the seven stars of Suzaku. I wish I had told you I was in 
love with you when we were younger.

Perhaps you would&#39;ve listened. . . I mean believed me. Most of the 
time it seems as if you think most of what I say is rubbish. Of course 
most of what I said was, most of what I talked about was food.

I hurt in a way I&#39;ve never hurt before. I hurt on the inside at a 
place I can&#39;t seem to reach, and the hurt only gets worse everytime I 
see you in pain or when I think of what it was that hurt you.

I wish I hadn&#39;t taken my uniform off. I wish I hadn&#39;t been in such a 
hurry to get home. I wish I never even saw the book that brought us to 
this incredulous place. This wonderful, lovely, depressing place.

Life just doesn&#39;t seem worth living without your happy face anymore. 
So I&#39;m going to try and make you happy. Somehow.

If I can awaken Suzaku, I&#39;m going to wish to become your friend again. 
I&#39;m going to wish myself the courage to tell you my feelings. I want 
to be together again, even if only as friends.

I will not be defeated.

More Author Notes: *scratches back of head* This is my first piece of 
fanfiction I have every written that I have ever posted. I wrote this 
because my friend was pissing me off by talking constantly of Fushigi 
Yuugi, and then I couldn&#39;t get it off my mind so I wrote this 
*shrugs*....These are just some of my thoughts on what could be going 
through Miaka and Yui&#39;s heads. And I also think I made mention of 
something that shouldn&#39;t have happened yet. Shangri-la out.
