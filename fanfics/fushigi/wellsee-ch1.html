<h2>a <a href="../fushigi/index.html">Fushigi Yuugi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/majean.html">Majean</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Miaka... Ever since I saw you, I can&#39;t stop thinking about you. I was
so worried, and now I know you&#39;re okay, but... I don&#39;t feel relieved.
All this time you were all right. You were being taken care of by
Tamahome. Tamahome who you found soon after your arrival here. Tamahome
who kept you safe. He saved you when you were in danger. And what did I
get...?

But I have Nakago and he took care of me. He&#39;ll protect me. But...

I feel something strange inside; it&#39;s so hollow. Whenever I think about
you Miaka... It makes my hands shake. You told me we&#39;d be enemies if I
became the Seiryuu no Miko. You were trying to keep me away from this
role. We were best friends, why are you betraying me?

Miaka... My childhood friend. My present enemy. Why do I feel this way?
Why do I want so much to hurt you? I wish you could understand my pain!
But you had someone there to protect you!! And it was... him...

But for a simple twist of fate it could have been me. Tamahome would be
in love with me! But it&#39;s you... Why you? I&#39;m the smart one! You&#39;re
just a clutz so easily lured by food.

Ah, my heart is beating so fast... And that strange feeling won&#39;t go
away. Tamahome...? Could I have fallen for Tamahome? That must be it.
He was so heroic, the way he swooped in and saved us from those
bandits. It&#39;s a good thing he came along. You tried to save me, tried
to distract them so I could run away, but how could I leave you there?
I could never leave my best friend to be sold into slavery. I didn&#39;t
understand what was going on at the time, in fact I still don&#39;t, but I
knew that I couldn&#39;t leave you behind...!

And so Tamahome entered the scene and saved us both. The man with the
symbol of ogre etched on his forehead. He walked into your life and
mine, only he stayed with you. Why? Why are the two of you together?
The thought just... But it&#39;s because I care for Tamahome, too, isn&#39;t
it. That has to be it. Well, I won&#39;t stand for you being so easily
happy with him, &lt;him&gt; of all people. I&#39;ll take him away from you, Miaka,
and then...!! And then...

And then we&#39;ll see.
