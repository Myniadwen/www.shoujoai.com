<h1>Until Then</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fushigi/index.html">Fushigi Yuugi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>    Well, this came practically out of nowhere! ^_^ Nothing special,
just your standard &quot;Miaka thinks about Yui&quot; fic. However, Miaka may seem 
a bit different in this one than she does in others; I made her seem a 
bit more angsty and bitter. ^^; Hopefully I did a good job.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yui-chan...

Why did you do this to me? How could you turn against me like this?

You think I abandoned you. That I only came back for Tamahome and didn&#39;t
care about you. That&#39;s not true! Yeah, I was happy to see him, but I 
never stopped thinking about you, even for a minute.

Do you honestly think I&#39;d ever do anything to hurt you?

I ran all the way to Kutou to find you, and what did I get? A slap in 
the face. Harsh words.

You can&#39;t imagine how I felt when I discovered you&#39;d not only turned
against me, but you&#39;d poisoned Tamahome against me as well.

I don&#39;t care that you want to take him away from me. Losing a guy I&#39;ve
only known for a few months is nothing compared to losing you.

You wouldn&#39;t even listen to me when I tried to explain. All you wanted 
was to hurt me in the worst possible way.

Congratulations, Yui-chan. You succeeded.

To be honest I&#39;m even a bit angry with you right now. You&#39;d rather 
believe some smirking jerk than your best friend? Fine. Go ahead.

I don&#39;t care if you steal Tamahome away from me. I don&#39;t care how hard 
you slap me, or how many times you or your so-called knight in shining 
armor call me a stupid bitch. I don&#39;t even care if you try to kill me 
with your own hands.

I still love you.

I always have, and I always will.

No guy could ever replace you in my heart, Yui-chan. No matter how 
dreamy he is.

You&#39;re my best friend, and nothing will ever change that.

And when I finally summon Suzaku, I&#39;ll wish to end the war and to bring
you back.

Until then, I&#39;ll think of you every day, and pray for you every night.

Love always,
Yuuki Miaka.

                    ~

With shaking hands, Yui folded the letter and held it to her chest. 
Tears filled her eyes.

&quot;Miaka...&quot;

She missed her. She felt stupid for believing in Nakago. She felt 
guilty.

Everything Yui had denied ever since she became Seiryuu no Miko finally
overwhelmed her.

&quot;Miaka...&quot; she choked, tears rolling down her cheeks. &quot;If only I could
tell you how sorry I am...&quot;

She glanced out the window. The stars sure were pretty tonight...they
seemed to be brighter than usual.

&quot;We&#39;ll be together again someday...until then, please let her be safe,&quot;
Yui whispered, her eyes focused on the brightest star of them all.

------------------------------------------------------------

    Finished! ^_^ Yui was probably a bit OOC at the end, but even if
she didn&#39;t let it show in the series, I think that deep down, underneath
all the bitterness, she really did miss Miaka and feel bad for what
happened between them.
    Plus, my FY fics always tend to be a bit on the weird side. ^_^;
Oh, well...^_^
