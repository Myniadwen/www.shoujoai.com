<h1>To Hurt You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fushigi/index.html">Fushigi Yuugi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/peachgirldb.html">Peachgirldb</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Let&#39;s get one thing straight. I&#39;m only in this for the pain I can cause
you.  Ahh..you&#39;ve always been so beautiful. So exquisite.
So...oblivious. You&#39;re lying in my bed asleep and I stroke your cheek
gently. Keeping up appearances, you see. It&#39;s not like I care for you
that way. Or any way. You&#39;re a pair of muddy sneakers left to dry on
the back porch, so no one will see. You&#39;re just a toy, played with once
and then forgotten by some careless child.

Or is that how you saw me?

Whatever. It doesn&#39;t matter to me. I was through with you long before
you betrayed me.

You cough slightly in your sleep. How weak you are...I hope you don&#39;t
wake up. I don&#39;t feel like playing the loving girlfriend today. Am I
your girlfriend? Your pretend one, I mean. I don&#39;t know. You&#39;ve never
mentioned anyone else. For once, you&#39;ve acted intelligently and you
haven&#39;t talked about HIM since our last fight. You&#39;re so naive to think
you could just say his name around me casually.

Not that I care about him anymore. You wanted him, you got him, I
wanted him, I got you. I suppose I can&#39;t be too picky, even if you are
the most annoying creature on earth.

But every time I touch you I&#39;m reminded that he touched you first. And
every time you touch me so eagerly I remember it was the same way you
touched him. It&#39;s all I can do just to keep from shoving you out the
door.

And I never do. I can&#39;t refuse you no matter what. I&#39;m starting to
wonder if this is really just for revenge. I think of what happened to
me and I feel...almost as though I could cry.

I don&#39;t cry anymore, though.

I kiss you softly, afraid to rouse you because of the things I&#39;m
feeling. The things I&#39;m always feeling. Your eyelids flutter, though,
and I watch you - watching me. You reach for me, childlike, and pull me
closer to rest against your naked body. Your lips part slowly; your
face displaying your extreme vulnerability at this moment.

&quot;Yui-chan,&quot; you whisper, &quot;what do you feel for me?&quot;

You always asked the worst questions in school. Now you&#39;re asking the
worst one of me.

I hate you, Miaka Yuki. This is of course what I should say to you. I
should hurt you now and get it over with. I hate you with a passion,
which clearly explains my desire for you..right?

Well...maybe.

I kiss you softly, trying not to let my mouth damn me. I hate you,
but...

&quot;...I love you...&quot;
