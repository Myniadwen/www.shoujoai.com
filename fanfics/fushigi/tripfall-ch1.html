<h1>Trip, Fall, Forgive Me</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fushigi/index.html">Fushigi Yuugi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kimmie.html">Kimmie</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sometimes Tamahome makes me wonder if he&#39;s worth it. He&#39;s so dense
sometimes! Not that I can really talk... but, I wish he didn&#39;t have to
be such a *guy*. It&#39;s awful. It really is. I&#39;m fighting against my best
friend, and I think I might be in love with her, and I&#39;m here with
several really cute, wonderful guys, and I can&#39;t control my stupid
hormones! Argh! At least Yui-chan doesn&#39;t stare at my breasts.

But, if she did, would she like them? Iie! I feel like such a pervert
or something. I shouldn&#39;t wonder if Yui-chan likes my breasts. I
shouldn&#39;t wonder what hers look like. However, I can&#39;t help it! As much
as I like guys, there&#39;s just that certain attraction to someone who
knows what kind of stuff you have to go through. Yui-chan knows me
better than anyone else... and she is prettier than I am... much
prettier.

I wonder what would have happened if I&#39;d told her how I felt. Maybe
then we&#39;d still be friends, maybe more. Of course, maybe she&#39;d hate me
more than she does now... not that *that* is possible.

I&#39;m a fool. I really, truly am a fool. I get transported to another
world, and suddenly, I forget all about Yui-chan. What she doesn&#39;t
realize is that I remembered really fast. After the initial shock wore
off, I was actively looking for her. Of course, *then* I get swept up
in all of this Suzaku stuff. It&#39;s all one big distraction!

Right now, all I want is for Yui to forgive me, and let me hug her.
She&#39;ll smell like jasmine and lavender. Her hair will tickle my nose.
My arms will wrap around her tiny waist, and hers will go around my
neck. We&#39;ll whisper secrets in each other&#39;s ears, and smile, and laugh
like it was old times. At least, that&#39;s how it plays out in my mind.

I wish I could convince her that Nakago does not have her best
interests in mind. All he wants is for her to call Seiryuu!

We&#39;ve also got that problem with Tamahome. She wants him, I&#39;ve got him.
I&#39;d give him up if I could have her instead. But, I do love him. She&#39;s
just... even more special to me.

We said we&#39;d never let a guy come between us. What happened, Yui-chan?
We let more than a guy come between us. There&#39;s a war, a world, and a
million bits of misunderstanding in addition to Tamahome.

I&#39;d give anything to have you back. You don&#39;t know how much you mean to
me! It&#39;s everything. You&#39;ve been my world for so long, and now you&#39;re
refusing to be part of it. It hurts, Yui-chan. Nothing has ever hurt
this badly... not my worst fall, not stabbing myself in the heart...
Nothing hurts as much as losing you.

Please, Yui-chan... forgive me. Let me back into your arms so I can let
you know how firmly stuck you are in my heart.

And, then? We&#39;ll go out for Chinese.
