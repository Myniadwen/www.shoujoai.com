<h1>Crime and Punishment</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mouse/index.html">Mouse!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Reiko Moun smiled at her friends as they left the
prestigious academy with her classmates. The black
haired girl wore the same sort of uniform as her
friends, the slim young woman walking with a
unconscious sort of grace.

&quot;It must stink having to live in campus housing,&quot;
Shiori Harada said, her red hair coming down to the
base of her throat. She was cute in a pixieish sort of
way, with a button nose and sparkling eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Reiko shrugged, clearly a bit
uncomfortable with her living here at the school.

&quot;We&#39;d better get going,&quot; Sally Morita said, the older
girl giving Reiko a compassionate look. Ger blue hair
was tied back, the taller athlete giving off a more
mature air. &quot;We&#39;ll see you tomorrow, okay?&quot; she added.

&quot;See you,&quot; Reiko waved as she watched her friends
leave the campus.

Turning Reiko headed towards the west, where a modern
apartment complex waited, built by the school to house
teachers and staff. She entered the bottom floor of
the rounded tower and took the elevator up, swiftly
rising to the penthouse suite.

Reiko sighed, putting her hand on the door knob as she
though, &#39;If only you know how hard it was living here,
my friends.&#39; Once the lock recognized her palm print
she took a deep breath and opened up the door.

&quot;Master!&quot; Sei Momozono squealed, the lovely blonde
crushing Reiko to her full breasts, ones that were
barely contained by her skimpy maids costume. &quot;I&#39;ve
missed you,&quot; she purred, pulling the young woman even
closer.

&quot;Cant... breathe...&quot; Reiko managed. Then she squeaked
as in a single gesture her uniform skirt was yanked
down from behind, revealing her plain cotton panties.

&quot;Aww, you didn&#39;t use the bikini&#39;s I laid out for you,&quot;
the redhead pouted, gently patting that ass. Miyuki
Nasu rose as she snuggled up to Reiko&#39;s back, the
muscular young woman adding, &quot;I like you in that sort
of thing, Master...&quot;

With remarkable agility Reiko slid from both women&#39;s
grip, panting softly as she waved them back, &quot;Give me
a minute, please!&quot;

&quot;Awwww!&quot; both maid clad women pouted.

&#39;How did I get into this mess?&#39; Reiko Moun wondered,
even though she knew the answer: she had inherited it.

For centuries there had been a daring thief called
Mouse, who had created a famous legacy of being able
to steal anything. The identity of Mouse had been
passed down the Moun family for generations, and now
it had landed squarely in Reiko&#39;s lap.

&quot;Dinner&#39;s on, Master,&quot; Miyuki said cheerfully, her
bottom wiggling seductively as she walked to the
suite&#39;s kitchen, &quot;and Sei&#39;s readying your bath.&quot;

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Reiko bolted to the bathroom, hoping she
could head her off. She whipped open the bathroom door
and opened her mouth...only to freeze.

&quot;Your bath&#39;s ready, Master,&quot; Sei purred, the busty
blonde standing in the tub covered in suds and nothing
else, &quot;and I&#39;m ready to wash your back, too.&quot;

&#39;I&#39;m in hell,&#39; Reiko thought as she meekly walked in.

Growing up Reiko hadn&#39;t thought it odd that her father
Sorata had lived with three women, with a child&#39;s
innocence she had thought that all families had people
like mommas Mei, Yayoi and Hazuki. Nor had she
questioned the games they played, climbing buildings,
disabling alarms, opening windows and dozens of other
skills. It wasn&#39;t until her birthday last year that
her father had explained what he was training her
for...that she was the latest Mouse. And now it was
her time to take the job, since he was finally
retiring.

And along with the job Reiko had also inherited Sei, a
cousin of her momma Mei who had been trained to be her
assistant in a family tradition as old as her own.
Privately Reiko often wondered what had gone on in
that training, since much of Sei&#39;s time seemed to be
spent trying to serve Reiko in very intimate ways.

Very clean and blushing faintly Reiko and Sei joined a
smirking Miyuki in the kitchen to a lovely feast.
&quot;Master, do we have a new job coming up?&quot; Miyuki asked
as she and Sei dished up the food then took their
places at the table. Originally both woman had
protested that servants didn&#39;t eat with the Master,
but Reiko put her foot down on that.

&quot;Yes we do,&quot; Reiko confirmed as she ate, &quot;I sent the
warning note to the museum curator and police today.&quot;

&quot;So, we&#39;re going after the Inuit mask..&quot; Sei nodded.
She smiled as she looked at Reiko adoringly, &quot;It&#39;s a
worthy target for Mouse.&quot;

Reiko blushed as she looked down at her food, trying
not to notice how little her companions costumes
covered. &quot;We&#39;ll need to go over the plans after
dinner,&quot; she mused, &quot;I have a rough idea, but we&#39;ll
need to fill it out more...&quot;

Boing! Something bounced at the edge of Reiko&#39;s
vision. Turning she nearly went face first into a full
breast. &quot;That tickles, Master,&quot; Miyuki purred,
wiggling a bit. She smiled impishly as she cooed,
&quot;More soup?&quot;

&#39;I&#39;m in so much trouble,&#39; Reiko sighed as she held out
her bowl obediently.

Later that night, the police had surrounded the Museum
of antiquities, squad cars and foot patrols covering
the whole area. &quot;All right,&quot; Inspector Katrine
Zenigata scowled, &quot;the sewers have been covered?
There&#39;s no ground approaches?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; her lieutenant nodded, &quot;we&#39;re covered.&quot;

&quot;So how does Mouse plan to do this?&quot; Katrine narrowed
her brown eyes. &quot;He or she said they&#39;re going to get
the Inuit mask...&quot; she mused, her trenchcoat
fluttering in the breeze, her old fashioned hat barely
staying on.

&quot;She?&quot; the younger man blinked.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Katrine shrugged, &quot;the few times I&#39;ve seen
this new Mouse I&#39;ve thought there were some extra
curves.&quot;

The wind picked up slightly as the man asked, &quot;Is it
true this Mouse only takes items that were illegally
acquired?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Katrine said to him sourly, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t
mean Mouse isn&#39;t a criminal, too.&quot; She irritably
brushed wind swept hair back from her face as she
complained, &quot;Where is that damned breeze coming from?&quot;

&quot;I..&quot; the younger man started then trailed off in
shock.

Thunk! Clack! Thunk! Clack! Thunk! Clack! Thunk!
Clack! Massive hooks descended from the darkened sky
to latch on to the sides of the building even as the
wind roared up even more, some kind of giant aircraft
hovering overhead. To the sound of straining engines
the building was bodily torn up from it&#39;s foundations,
the massive structure trailing pipes and power lines
from it&#39;s base.

&quot;Get a spot light up there!&quot; Katrine roared.

Mouse grinned as the spotlight landed on her, the
masked figure&#39;s costume tailored to make the slim
woman&#39;s gender as ambiguous as possible. &quot;There&#39;s
nothing Mouse can&#39;t steal,&quot; she declared, pitching her
voice low, &quot;remember that.&quot;

&quot;Damn you Mouse,&quot; Katrine roared as the Museum swiftly
disapeared into the night. She spun to glare at her
subordinate, &quot;Do we have helicopter support? Anything
that we can chase them with?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re gone, ma&#39;an, we wouldn&#39;t even know where to
send the helicopters.&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; Katrine ripped her hat off, tossing it on the
ground then stomping on it in pure frustration.

&quot;We&#39;ll get Mouse next time,&quot; the other officer sighed.

Meanwhile, Mouse looked up from where she stood on top
of the Museum, gazing at the giant flying disk that
they had also stolen earlier that night. Knowing that
there was no ground access had made Mouse look for a
unconventional solution, and that was it.

&quot;So now we just have to fly this back home, Master?&quot;
Sei asked from behind her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mouse turned... then the teenaged girl&#39;s eyes
bugged out. &quot;Get dressed!&quot;

&quot;But master,&quot; Sei pouted, her skin tight uniform
puddled at her feet.

&quot;We&#39;re trying to work here,&quot; Mouse whispered, trying
not to look at the full, bouncy breasts. She took a
breath, &quot;Look, we&#39;ll do it once we get home okay?&quot;

&quot;Oh all right,&quot; Sei pouted and slipped into her racy
ninja wear.

Much later that night a exhausted Reiko plopped into
her bed. She lay there a moment, eyes closed then
stretched out,, only to feel something soft under the
covers. Turning over she peeled down the overs only to
meet Miyuki&#39;s impish gaze.

&quot;Good evening Master,&quot; Miyuki purred.

&quot;What are you...?&quot; Reiko stammered.

&quot;This won;t hurt a bit,&quot; Miyuki smoothly pinned Reiko
down, kissing her lingeringly.

&quot;But I&#39;ve got school tomorrow,&quot; Reiko groaned as she
felt her body respond.

&quot;Buy Master your nipples are So hard,&quot; Miyuki purred,
&quot;...don&#39;t they hurt?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Reiko squeaked, &quot;they&#39;re fine! Really!&quot;

&quot;Let me kiss them all better...&quot; Miyuki eagerly went
to work

&#39;I&#39;m in hell,&quot; Reiko mused then gasped as Miyuki did
something VERY devlish with her tongue.

The End...?

Notes: This is based off the anime series Mouse, a
mildy perverted comedy anime. One of the running gags
in the series is that the character Mouse is
surrounded by three willing sex bombs whom he tries
NOT to take advantage of.</pre>
