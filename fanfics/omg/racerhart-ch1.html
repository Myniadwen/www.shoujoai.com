<h1>Racer's Heart (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Prelude: First meeting.

Chihiro Fujimi looked up in curiosity from where she was sitting at a 
table in the Whirlwind bike shop sharing lunch with friends as she heard 
a bike pull up outside. &quot;Was that..?&quot; the older woman started to ask 
Keiichi and Belldandy.

&quot;Kei-chan!&quot; the black haired young woman yelled as she burst in a moment 
later, leather jacket open and boots gleaming.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Chihiro looked between her and Keiichi, aware of her heart beating 
a bit faster on seeing this new arrival.

&quot;Oops,&quot; the young woman looked remarkably sheepish all of a sudden, it 
was remarkably cute. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m so rude,&quot; she bowed to them all then 
she looked up with a blush as she introduced herself, &quot;I&#39;m Megumi... 
Keiichi&#39;s sister.&quot;

Chihiro felt her lips curl up into a smile of greeting as she studied 
the striking young lady. &quot;Awww,&quot; she purred out, &quot;I just adore polite 
young women.&quot; She gestured gracefully to another chair, &quot;Please, do sit 
down.&quot;

Of course in all the chaos caused by the arrival of Megumi and Keiichi&#39;s 
father Keima Chihiro and Megumi&#39;s dramatic meeting was overshadowed, but 
it still lingered in both of their minds. A seed, once planted, must 
bear it&#39;s fruit.. and in this case that fruit would be most unusual 
indeed.

One: Whirlwind

&quot;Keiichi,&quot; Chihiro asked him some weeks later as she calmly sorted out 
the paperwork, moving all of the paid bills into one pile and unpaid 
ones in the other, &quot;what&#39;s this I hear about your sister being the 
Queen?&quot;

&quot;Of the campus racers, yeah,&quot; Keiichi agreed distractedly, the young man 
tuning the bike carefully. He had been working with Chihiro a while and 
knew his friend was a touch taskmaster... but it was because of that he 
wanted to give her his best.

&quot;And she beat the best on the Inokuradai circuit,&quot; Chihiro murmured 
thoughtfully, referring to the winding road out to the satellite campus 
of Nekomi Tech. The bikers on campus raced there informally, even as 
they hurried to and from campus, and the bikers there were very, very 
good. She herself had been the Queen once, so she knew what it took...

&quot;Yeah, but why the curiosity?&quot; Keiichi asked her, not even looking away 
from his work, his hands smeared with grease.

Chihiro smiled back slightly, her expression thoughtful. &quot;Because,&quot; she 
finally answered him, &quot;I think she&#39;s interesting.&quot; She twisted the 
golden rings that she wore on one finger without thinking about it, &quot;Is 
she seeing anyone?&quot;

Clunk! This time Keiichi dropped his wrench in surprise, banging the 
hand resting on the engine in the process. &quot;Oww,&quot; he sucked at the 
reddish scrape even as he finally looked at his boss, &quot;not that I know 
of.&quot;

Chihiro raised her eyebrows, &quot;That&#39;s surprising.&quot;

Keiichi pulled his injured hand away from his mouth, looking at the 
scrape mournfully. &quot;She&#39;s never been much for dating,&quot; he noted, &quot;just 
concentrates her sports teams and clubs.&quot; He smiled fondly in memory, 
&quot;Baseball is her favorite.&quot;

Chihiro&#39;s face lit up, &quot;Do you think that she&#39;s...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Keiichi said a bit wryly, well aware of his boss&#39; 
interest in shonen-ai and apparently now shoujo-ai, too, &quot;it&#39;s not like 
I&#39;ve ever asked her.&quot;

Chihiro smirked, &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t... you&#39;re too polite.&quot; A smile, &quot;Why, 
you&#39;re not even asking me the obvious question.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Keiichi muttered, blushing.

&quot;Sorry, Keii-chan,&quot; Chihiro softened her voice, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t tease.&quot; She 
sat back, &quot;In case you were wondering.. yes, I am.&quot;

Keiichi dropped the wrench again with a thump. &quot;Most people,&quot; he said 
dryly, &quot;don&#39;t talk about things like that so openly.&quot;

This time Chihiro gave him a full grin as she answered, &quot;I&#39;m not most 
people.&quot; She finished her paperwork, setting up from her seat and 
stretching as she added, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.. my intentions so far are 
completely honorable.&quot;

Keiichi managed a smile, &quot;They&#39;d better be... you&#39;ve met our dad after 
all.&quot;

Chihiro laughed as she nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot; She picked up 
her jacket from where it hung from the wall, &quot;Close up when you&#39;re done, 
I&#39;m going out for a while.&quot;

Two: Nekomi Tech

Megumi Morisato jogged over to where her bike was, her school bag slung 
over her shoulder as she looked her older cycle over carefully. It was 
all stock, with no special modifications and improvements added and she 
always felt a bit of pride knowing she had won against the best equipped 
races on it. She climbed aboard and started the engine, then she was 
off.

As Megumi left the satellite campus the leather and jean clad woman was 
aware of the respectful distance the other bikers gave her and smiled 
wryly. She had refused accepting the title of Queen but the other&#39;s 
still treated her as it, no matter how she protested. She was getting 
used to it, sort of, but she still didn&#39;t like it.

The unfamiliar bike waited by the side of the road until Megumi rode by, 
then she fell into place beside her, her full helmet and leather riding 
gear making her unidentifiable. The gesture was unmistakable, however, a 
challenge for a race.

&#39;Well, well,&#39; Megumi thought with a grin, &#39;this could be fun.&#39;

The word raced up the route as they accelerated, drivers pulling aside 
as the two swept down the road. They stuck close, neither seemingly able 
to break away, and both used all tricks a long time racer on this route 
could do. Both women seemed to know the track with a intimate knowledge, 
taking it&#39;s curves and bends like a lover...

&#39;Damn she&#39;s good,&#39; Megumi thought as she gazed at the unfamiliar rider. 
It wasn&#39;t one of her usual challengers for the Queen title, either, she 
rode with far more experience than that. Holding her off as they raced 
was the most fun Megumi had in weeks, and part of her wanted the race to 
continue forever, but they were running out of road.

Her opponent must have realized it too, for she reluctantly backed off. 
In silent agreement they both coasted to a stop at the bottom of the 
hill, Megumi putting her kickstand down and standing by her bike. She 
could almost feel herself holding her breath as the other rider pushed 
her bike to join Megumi&#39;s then unclipped her racing jacket to undo the 
helmet strap.

&quot;Miss Fujimi!&quot; Megumi blurted in surprise as she saw the older woman 
take her bike helmet off, shaking out her short hair.

&quot;Chihiro, please,&quot; she rolled her eyes, laughing softly. She offered her 
hand to Megumi and warmly said, &quot;Good race.&quot;

Megumi took it, shaking it firmly as she said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;I may have been behind someone all the way down, at least I had a nice 
view,&quot; Chihiro murmured with a wry grin.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Megumi blinked in confusion, feeling almost certain she hadn&#39;t 
heard what she thought she just heard.

Chihiro grinned impishly, glad to see the racer off balance about 
something. &quot;Never mind,&quot; Chihiro waved that off as she said cheerfully, 
&quot;as a former Queen I thought I&#39;d check out the current holder of the 
title.&quot;

Megumi&#39;s own lips pulled up in a smile, &quot;So what did you think?&quot;

&quot;Good as I heard,&quot; Chihiro said. &quot;If you aren&#39;t busy with classes,&quot; 
Chihiro&#39;s voice took on the same sort of purr it had the first time they 
met, &quot;would you care to join me for lunch?&quot;

Megumi hesitated, getting the sense there was something more going on. 
&quot;Well,&quot; she shrugged, &quot;why not?&quot;

&quot;Good, I&#39;ll lead this time,&quot; Chihiro said as she smoothly mounted her 
bike, well aware of how good she looked in the tight racing gear.

Megumi gulped, surprised at a sudden tightness in her throat. &quot;Only if 
you can keep the lead,&quot; Megumi tried to summon some bravado as she 
climbed on her bike and strapped her helmet on.

Chihiro just laughed.
