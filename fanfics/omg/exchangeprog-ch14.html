Hahahahhaha! Lind bought me a ring! My heart skipped not one but five 
beats when she promised me an even more spectacular ring for when we are 
engaged. When we&#39;re engaged! I never thought she would say those words. 
This is too good to be true! Ah I can picture my dream wedding now, 
flowers, doves and one gorgeous dress made by the finest seamstress 
goddess...Calm yourself Peorth, you&#39;re getting to carried away. Oh well 
I&#39;ll allow myself one last squeal YAY Lind wants to marry me in the 
future!

I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s thought that far ahead really, of course, I&#39;ve 
thought about us getting married but this is Lind, she doesn&#39;t think 
about the future. I suppose I&#39;m turning my ice queen into a giant ice 
slushie, it makes her all the more adorable.

&quot;Peorth where are we headed now?&quot; asked Lind which snapped me out of my 
thoughts. I stopped walking abruptly almost making Lind trip by 
accident. That&#39;s a very good point where am I headed? I&#39;m too excited to 
think really. I pondered for a while then glorious inspiration hit my 
head. I quickly started pacing again with Lind behind me. We walked to 
the end of the street and took several turns down winding pathways but 
eventually we made it to Noodle King- a small corner noodle store in the 
middle of nowhere that was a small paradise to all that know its 
whereabouts.

&quot;Ah Peorth-San. Welcome&quot; called out the old man who owned the store. He 
sat behind the counter and waved for us to come in. We walked in and sat 
in front of the counter and he gave us our cups and tea.

&quot;Hello Mr. Satoshi&quot; I said and smiled warmly. He&#39;s a short, slightly 
round man with a personality that attracts all. He wore his signature 
Hawaiian bandana, a memento of his days when he travelled across the 
world on his motorbike, and as usual and his white beard was as rough as 
ever. I always love listening to his stories it always reminds me of my 
past when I curiously explored earth, desperate to know all of its 
secrets.

&quot;So what can I get for you today?&quot; he asked whilst wiping a glass.

&quot;We&#39;ll have two of your specials&quot; Lind will be sure to enjoy this.

&quot;Coming right up&quot; he said and walked into the back to start cooking. I 
turned to look at Lind who gave me a look that meant &#39;what are you up 
to?&#39; Little does she know I just made her walk into her own heaven. Only 
us and another couple were in the small restaurant, probably because it 
was a little early to be having lunch.

&quot;What&#39;s the thing that you love the most?&quot; I asked whilst twirling a 
strand of her hair in my hand.

&quot;If I answer wrongly will you subject me to restricted level magic?&quot;

&quot;...I suppose not.&quot;

&quot;Well, um, you?&quot; she said nervously which is very unlike her I might 
add; I&#39;m not that frightening am I? I&#39;m just little, harmless Peorth.

&quot;Of course me silly. What else?&quot;

&quot;Well I suppose I love...&quot;

&quot;Ramen coming up!&quot; Shouted Mr.Satoshi as he walked out of the kitchen 
perfectly balancing two large bowls on the palms of his hands. &quot;Careful 
now it&#39;s hot&quot; he said and placed it down in front of us. Ramen upon 
ramen served with delicious soup and all the trimmings like fish cakes 
and what not.

How I wish I had a camera on me, Lind&#39;s expression is to die for. She&#39;s 
positively shocked at seeing such a heavenly bowl of ramen before her. 
Her mouth is agape and hers eyes are wide, glimmering even. Also is that 
a bit of drool I see on the side of her mouth? Her reaction is simply 
too funny. Who would have thought the notorious ice queen, famous for 
her monotonous expressions, is brought down, and reduced to a drooling 
speechless person by a bowl of ramen. I placed the chopsticks into her 
hand and it seemed my touch brought her back into the living world.

&quot;This isn&#39;t a dream you know Lind-chan. You can eat it.&quot; She nodded and 
took the first bite of her meal. Her eyes lit up and she hurriedly ate 
the ramen with vigour occasionally chocking from the speed she was 
eating at but she continued happily. Ah I&#39;m such a good girlfriend.

After giving up on several attempts to feed Lind my ramen I gave up and 
just handed the bowl over to her completely; she really eats too fast. 
As she devoured my portion, I headed off to the toilets to freshen up.

&quot;Aw aren&#39;t you the pretty picture.&quot;

&quot;Yes I suppose I am thank you&quot; I replied automatically...Hold on a 
moment I&#39;m the only person in here, unless.

&quot;Urd get out here right now&quot; I commanded and in a small puff of smoke 
appeared mini Urd floating in front of me. &quot;Urd what are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;Well after escaping all the traps and curses you placed around the 
house to prevent me from escaping I thought I&#39;d come and pay you a 
visit,&quot; she said with a devilish grin.

&quot;What how? There&#39;s no way you could have escaped all 500 traps!&quot;

&quot;500 more like 800! It wasn&#39;t easy mind you. All those bombs and giant 
mallets and spikes appearing out of nowhere. You&#39;ve scarred me for life 
I&#39;ll have you know!&quot; she yelled and showed me her pinky finger where she 
had put a mini plaster on.

&quot;Fine you can have you&#39;re revenge later. I&#39;m busy right now on a date so 
I&#39;ll play with you later&quot; I said and patted her on the head.

&quot;Play? Do you think I&#39;m some sort of child that needs entertaining?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Fine, I don&#39;t care. I didn&#39;t even come here for revenge anyway, but I 
suppose you don&#39;t want to know what I found out now.&quot; I curiously raised 
my eyebrow.

&quot;Tell me&quot;

&quot;No&quot; she said and stuck her tongue out at me.

Chance! Finally I have the perfect opportunity to try out my Lind stare! 
No I&#39;m not sad or crazy. The Lind stare is a special ability where Lind 
stares at her opponent and fear is instilled in them, it&#39;s the perfect 
way to get information out of people. I massaged my eyebrows and got 
ready. 3, 2 1 Go! I gazed at Urd with my best impersonation of Lind; 
this has to work!

&quot;Do you have something in your eye?&quot; I face faulted, I suppose my 
impersonation needs some work.

&quot;No I&#39;m fine. Just tell me what you found out.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll cost ya&quot; she said with a wink.

&quot;Fine. Name your price.&quot;

&quot;I get to take pictures of you on your date&quot;

&quot;WHAT!? YOU PERVERT!!&quot; I screamed and threw a fireball at her...by 
accident of course. Once the smoke had cleared a soot covered Urd 
appeared and she didn&#39;t look one bit happy. &quot;woops. Heh heh, sorry, 
impulse&quot; I muttered.

&quot;Right. Next time before your impulse comes into play can you let me 
explain first?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an impulse I can&#39;t guarantee anything, but go on then explain.&quot; 
Urd snapped her fingers and cleaned herself of the soot and summoned 
forth a large screen. Ever the performer Urd took a pair of glasses out 
from her pocket and wore them in an attempt to look smart.

&quot;You see this? This is the latest dating polls&quot;

&quot;The dating polls? You want me to see the dating p...Umph! Umph!&quot; Before 
I could even finish my sentence Urd threw a spell at me and now my mouth 
had a giant red cross on it preventing me from speaking. I tugged at it 
and tried magic but it just wouldn&#39;t budge.

&quot;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted. This is the latest 
dating polls and as you can see you and Lind have dropped down to couple 
number 4 in heaven. Since I am your beloved friend I support you in 
whatever you do, which in turn means I place huge bets on you and Lind 
on the polls. Since your number has dropped this means I am losing...a 
lot. So what I plan to do is release a picture of you guy on a date to 
the daily heaven express and bam you guys are number one again and I win 
loads...which will of course be donated to charity.&quot; She snapped her 
fingers and the red cross disappeared and thankfully it didn&#39;t leave a 
mark. I looked at Urd&#39;s small size and was so tempted just to squash her 
since her plans are always money or betting related.

&quot;What charity?&quot; I asked suspiciously.

&quot;Um the Help a Urd charity?&quot; Honestly how is she related to Belldandy? 
Hmm would it really be that bad to go along with her plan? After all, I 
do like the spotlight and attention.

&quot;Fine I agree but make sure its just the one picture, and nothing to 
explicit or revealing.&quot;

&quot;Got it nothing ecchi&quot; she said and poofed a camera into her hands, I 
sighed again she even wore a hat that said &#39;press&#39; on it.

&quot;Now give me that information you found out.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah that. Well Mist is on earth, she refuses to believe Lind is on 
holiday. She&#39;s come here to drag Lind&#39;s butt back to heaven.&quot;

&quot;WHAT! You can&#39;t be serious! Stall her, trap her, do something Urd!&quot;

&quot;I did, I let loose Skuld. The two of them are having lots of fun right 
now, Skuld is trying out her new weaponry on Mist, and since well 
Valkyries can&#39;t use their powers without permission, it&#39;s just like 
watching Skuld and Keiichi play.&quot;

&quot;Still though I don&#39;t know how long Skuld can keep Mist busy. Why do 
these things always happen to me? I just wanted one nice peaceful date 
without any godly intervention, but noooo&quot; I said and leant against the 
wall and hit my head against it.

&quot;Tell ya what for an extra photo I&#39;ll give you a sign every time Mist is 
near you guys&quot;

&quot;What choice do I have?&quot; I mumbled and left the toilets to see Lind had 
several bowls stacked up in a pile where my seat used to be.

All my worry was washed away the moment Lind turned to me and smiled 
like a child

&quot;Peorth come try this,&quot; she said enthusiastically. I suppose I can relax 
after all Urd is my guardian angel...oh god what have I agreed to?

----------

Time: 1:45pm

Location: La Mode fashion store

Urd status: Floating above the entrance door

Its fine, everything is fine. Lind is looking at some jackets and Urd is 
guarding the store whist I am acting like a paranoid fool. Then again if 
Mist is coming then I have a right to be paranoid.

&quot;Peorth are you ok? You seem on edge&quot; asked Lind with a worried 
expression on her face. Of course I&#39;m on edge, your crazy friend is 
coming to chase you down and take you away!

&quot;Fine, I&#39;m fine&quot; I exclaimed and smiled. She seemed to accept it and 
continued her browsing. I suppose I should tell Lind that Mist is on 
earth to find her, but although Lind doesn&#39;t show it I know she hates it 
when &#39;our&#39; time is interrupted. Be it a fangirl, friend, or superior 
Lind will let her fury be known. So its probably better if I don&#39;t tell 
Lind if I don&#39;t want the earth to be destroyed in a giant catastrophic 
battle of Valkyries. Really by not telling Lind I&#39;m saving our date and 
the earth; I&#39;m such a good goddess, Kami should promote me.

Of course it wasn&#39;t such smooth sailing from then on. In another store I 
proceeded to pay for our items when to my horror the cashier turned 
around and it was Urd in the cashier&#39;s outfit.

&quot;What are you doing here?!&quot; I exclaimed loudly making the people behind 
me raise their eyebrows.

&quot;Why I&#39;m scanning your items miss&quot; she said and took the clothes and 
bagged them. She then leaned in close to me &quot;Mist is close I suggest 
leaving now&quot; she whispered. &quot;Thank you miss, come again.&quot; I don&#39;t know 
what I found more shocking, Urd trying to pose as a 19-year-old cashier 
or the fact Mist was nearing us. I quickly grabbed Lind&#39;s hand and 
rushed to the next store.

----------

Time: 2:35

Location: Street

Urd status: Sitting on a traffic light

Everything is fine, Everything is fine, Everything is fine. Mist isn&#39;t 
here, Mist isn&#39;t here, Mist isn&#39;t here. Nothing will interrupt my time 
with Lind, nothing will interrupt my time with Lind, nothing will 
interrupt my time with Lind.

&quot;Peorth&quot; The date is going well, the date is going well, the date is 
going well.

&quot;Peorth!&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh Lind, sorry was I not paying attention?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine&quot; she replied. I gave her arm an affectionate squeeze and we 
continued walking up the street. I continued my mantra in my head, it 
really did seem to be working, I am somewhat calmer than before.

&quot;LINDDDDDDDDDD!!&quot; Oh you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. I looked around 
frantically; where is Urd?! I saw her sitting atop a pigeon and she was 
riding it up and down the street...DIVINE REVENGE!!...Wait I have more 
pressing matters to attend to right now.

&quot;Did someone call my name?&quot; asked Lind.

&quot;No, no, no. You&#39;re just hearing things dear&quot; I sheapishly answered.

&quot;LINDDDDDDDDDDDD!!&quot;

&quot;There it is again...You really didn&#39;t hear it?&quot;

&quot;HINDDDDDDD...EMBURG!! Learn about Hindemburg!!&quot; shouted out a tour 
guide with white hair. Finally she&#39;s helping out. Thank goodness for 
divine intervention even if it is Urd.

&quot;See Lind it&#39;s only the tour guide.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I could have sworn I heard my name though.&quot;

&quot;Oh well, let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;But&quot;

&quot;Look Ramen!&quot; I shouted and grabbed her hand and we dashed off. Phew 
crisis averted.

Time: 3:20pm

Location: Book store

Urd status: Does it really matter anymore?

I stared out of the window when I felt a pair of hands rest on my 
shoulders, I tensed immediately but relaxed when I saw a strand of blue 
hair out of the corner of my eye. She turned me around to face her, and 
she wore her usual expression except her eyes looked worried. The eyes 
are always the give away to what&#39;s she&#39;s feeling.

&quot;Something is the matter isn&#39;t there?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Nothing, what makes you think that?&quot;

&quot;...You seem distracted, annoyed even...Have I done something wrong?&quot; My 
heart melted when I heard that. Had I really been acting in a way where 
I was ignoring my Lind? It pains me to even think I was ignoring Lind. I 
slowly moved my hands to her waist and held her close and already her 
eyes seemed happier.

&quot;You&#39;ve never done anything wrong to me; I&#39;m the one who&#39;s acting like a 
fool.&quot; My eyes averted behind Lind as I saw Urd write a message on a 
bookshelf &#39;Mist is in the park opposite! Take your Ice cream and go!&#39; I 
knew I never should have told her about my ice queen to ice cream 
metaphor.

You know what? There&#39;s actually no point in running anymore, especially 
when it makes me so preoccupied that I ignore Lind. I might as well go 
and let Lind meet that knucklehead friend of hers and they can both 
battle it out. If the earth gets destroyed well...We&#39;ll continue our 
date in heaven. &quot;The thing I&#39;ve been distracted with is right outside, 
come on&quot; I took her hands and dragged her out of the store. We walked 
towards the park and I saw Mist. Anyone could spot her a mile away, with 
her white hair and Valkyrie uniform on she stuck out like a fruit tea in 
a Japanese tea house. Lind hadn&#39;t noticed anything yet but Mist turned 
in our direction and saw us, she then belted out

&quot;LINDDDDDDDDD!!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; exclaimed Lind as she looked around frantically, she recognised 
the voice and she knew it meant trouble. &quot;Oh great&quot; she murmured.

We walked into the park and Mist ran frantically behind us screaming and 
crying Lind&#39;s name. She ran with her out and tried to hug Lind but Lind 
quickly sidestepped making Mist run into a lamppost.

&quot;Oi! What are you doing here?&quot; Lind half yelled whilst massaging her 
temples.

&quot;I came here because Senya is BORING! She&#39;s making me do all of your 
work! It&#39;s so unfair so I decided to bring you back with me&quot; she whined 
like a child.

&quot;Of course she&#39;s making you do all of my work, I am on vacation.&quot;

&quot;BUT YOU NEVER GO ON VACATION!&quot;

&quot;WELL I AM NOW!&quot;

&quot;No way your just on holiday! Something is up!&quot; said Mist forcefully.

&quot;MIST! NUMBER 83! Unless you want a fight I suggest you leave now and 
drop the subject!&quot; Oh boy Lind&#39;s lost it. I&#39;ve never heard her yell 
ever. Well I&#39;ve never heard her yell when she&#39;s angry, I&#39;ve only ever 
heard her yell when I ...What am I thinking?! FOCUS PEORTH FOCUS!!

&quot;Fine! Let&#39;s sort this out the normal way!&quot;

&quot;Deal!&quot; Mist leapt backwards and Lind protectively put her arm in front 
of me and stepped forwards.

&quot;Lind what are you two doing?&quot; I asked somewhat worriedly.

&quot;Just watch,&quot; she said to me, and then she turned back to Mist &quot;Go on 
then 83 I&#39;ll let you summon your angel first.&quot;

&quot;HAH! I&#39;ve improved since last time. COME FORTH HURRICANE HAZE!!&quot; 
Shouted Mist. Her silver aura surrounded her and the wind blew fiercely, 
the sky even turned dark and a hole opened up in the clouds. She&#39;s 
powerful I admit, but it&#39;s all show. Mist started laughing wildly but 
then a large voice boomed out.

&quot;MIST! Valkyrie 11092831! You are hereby summoned immediately back to 
heaven for the use of magic without permission!&quot; HAHAHAHAHAH! GO LIND, 
GO LIND GO LIND! So that was her plan. Ahhhh my ice slush is so smart.

&quot;WHAT NO!!&quot; shouted Mist as she started evaporating. &quot;Just you wait till 
your vacation is over Lind! I&#39;ll go on vacation then you&#39;ll have to do 
my work!&quot; she yelled just before she disappeared. The sky cleared again 
and pedestrians went about their normal business as if it never 
happened. The people in this town certainly are very laid back.

&quot;Lind you&#39;re so COOL!&quot; I shouted and leapt up to hug her. I couldn&#39;t see 
her face but I knew she was blushing; she always blushes when I call her 
cool.

&quot;Heh well Mist isn&#39;t really that hard to outsmart.&quot; I kissed her on the 
cheek before stepping back.

&quot;Thank goodness she&#39;s gone&quot; I muttered.

&quot;Is she the reason why you&#39;ve been distracted for so long?&quot; Whoops, 
shouldn&#39;t have let that slip.

&quot;Well yes. Urd told me Mist was on earth to take you away, and I suppose 
I was a little worried that if you met Mist you might go back to 
heaven.&quot; I held my head down in shame and she place her hand on my head 
affectionately, then surprisingly flicked my head.

&quot;OWWW! What was that for?!&quot;

&quot;A wake up call.&quot;

&quot;Hmph! It still hurt&quot;

&quot;However it was necessary. Honestly why would I return to heaven with 
Mist. Do you think me that much of a work-aholic?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;Perhaps I am, but actually I&#39;m...enjoying this date,&quot; she said, the 
last part in particular, slightly quieter. I raised my eyebrow, heheh I 
sense a teasing moment.

&quot;what was that I didn&#39;t hear you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing I didn&#39;t say anything&quot;

&quot;Oh so you think I&#39;m boring or dull then?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re having a good time?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;Do you love me?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;HAH! Got you to say it!&quot; I was laughing like a little school kid, since 
Lind always gives me this speech that she only says she loves me in 
important situations, but yet I got her to admit it so easily. Some 
resolve she has. Maybe slowness is a Valkyrie thing; they&#39;ve been hit on 
the head one to many times. Then unexpectedly she kissed me! LIND KISSED 
ME! I usually initiate everything, this, this is unexpected, but, it&#39;s 
nice. It&#39;s a very nice change. My eyes were still closed when she pulled 
back, when I opened them Lind was smirking at me.

&quot;It seems to be the only way to stop your gloating.&quot; My jaw dropped. I 
was about to give her my speech about how I don&#39;t gloat when a picture 
fell from above in front of me. I caught it and I smiled immediately. 
The picture showed the moment Lind moved away from me, my eyes were 
still closed and Lind was smiling lightly. Lind moved behind me to look 
at it

&quot;Who sent the picture?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;Divine intervention&quot;
