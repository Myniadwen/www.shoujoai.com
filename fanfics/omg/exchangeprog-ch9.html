The sun poured in from the window and my eyes opened slowly. I realised 
I wasn&#39;t in my own room seeing as everything in the room from curtains 
to bed linen was either a shade of red or white. I tried to move my arm 
but found I was stuck in a firm grip. Peorth snuggled against me and 
held onto me tightly resting in the crook between my neck and shoulder. 
At first I found myself blushing when I woke up with her in the early 
days of our relationship, but now a month on it was common practice to 
wake up with her. If I woke up without her in my arms the rest of my day 
would be affected by my bad mood.

I felt her stir slightly in her sleep so I did what I could to comfort 
her, I moved my arm and held onto her small waist. Reaching down 
slightly I pulled the blanket up so that it was at least covering her 
lower back, she always kicked the blanket off in the night. I can&#39;t 
complain really she always keeps me warm since she always lies on top of 
me, but I know she gets cold.

It seemed we had slept in, a rarity nowadays since my magic band was 
lifted and I went out on more missions. The fact that I hadn&#39;t been 
contacted yet meant I had been given the day off by Senya. Peorth slowly 
released her grip on me and stretched out before slumping back down 
again.

&quot;Lind-chan you&#39;re awake aren&#39;t you?&quot; She mumbled

&quot;I am but you can go back to sleep for a little bit longer&quot; I said. I 
lazily started to draw circles on her back; I felt her smile into my 
neck.

&quot;Now that would be nice. But I have work to do today&quot; She moved slowly 
upwards along my body making me breathe in deeply in order to control 
myself, until finally our foreheads touched.

&quot;Work?&quot; I asked as I trailed my arms up and down her back.

&quot;Yes work. I&#39;ve had my holiday from operations department but now I need 
to go back to work in the Goddess relief department.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t pout now,&quot; she laughed. I wasn&#39;t pouting; I was just disappointed 
that we could spend the rest of the day together. Everything I thought 
of washed away the moment her lips touched mine in an affectionate kiss. 
I pressed her closer to me, if that were even possible and she caressed 
my face.

&quot;There&quot; She said once she pulled away &quot;That&#39;s to compensate for the fact 
I can&#39;t spend the rest of the day with you.&quot; My brow furrowed, this 
woman, how can she know what I&#39;m thinking all the time. Is it some 
mystical power she&#39;s attained from Kami? Or am I really that relaxed 
around her? She got up and jumped out of bed leaving me cold. I was too 
distracted by her form to even pull the blanket up. She could magic her 
clothes on but no. I stared on as she slowly and antagonising put each 
article of her clothing on. Did it have to be so revealing? I&#39;m 
surprised I haven&#39;t died because of blood loss yet because of all the 
nosebleeds I&#39;ve had dating her. She turned around and winked at me 
knowing full well I was watching. I quickly faced the other way and 
tried to think of boring mundane things like the reports waiting for me 
on my desk. I gasped when I felt her hand trail up my back as she placed 
the blanket on me.

&quot;Just in case you get a chill,&quot; she whispered slowly into my ear. Curse 
this woman and her relentless teasing. I am ice, I don&#39;t get cold.

----------

&quot;This is ridiculous!&quot; yelled Mist as she slammed her fist on her desk. I 
continued my work and let Senya deal with our loud colleague.

&quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;The most powerful goddess results have just been released and it says 
I&#39;m the 83rd most powerful goddess. I should be in the top ten!&quot;

&quot;Hey you&#39;re meant to doing work with your computer not looking at stupid 
polls,&quot; said Senya as she rubbed her temples. I usually never encouraged 
Mist&#39;s eccentrics towards the polls but this interested me

&quot;What number am I?&quot;

&quot;Lind is the third most powerful goddess in heaven! What is this 
ridiculousness? She should be below me!&quot; yelled Mist again as she typed 
away furiously on the keyboard. Third, I suppose that sounds about 
right. Number 2 must be her, and the number 1 goddess I suppose is 
Belldandy. No one can match her power.

&quot;Oh and Lind it seems your other half is number 48.&quot; I think I&#39;ll let 
Peorth find that out herself, god knows how she&#39;ll take it.

&quot;Well where am I then?&quot; Asked Senya. Mist typed again and she burst out 
laughing and hitting the desk wildly. &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re, you&#39;re number 101! HAHA some Head of Valkyrie&#39;s you are!&quot;

&quot;I am Head of the Valkyrie sector not because of power but because of my 
brain! Something you seem to lack most of the time.&quot;

&quot;Do you want a fight 101?&quot;

&quot;I can defeat you anytime 83.&quot; I shook my head; I really can&#39;t get any 
work done with the noise they were making. I already wasn&#39;t having lunch 
with Peorth, can they please not make my day worse.

&quot;Number 4 says be quiet or else&quot; I said without looking up from my 
paper. I heard them both sit back down in their chairs and finally there 
was silence again. I suppose for what little it was worth Mist and Senya 
were still rather powerful seeing as heaven had over a ten-thousand 
first class goddesses. At least they can summon their angels. What use 
is power if I am incomplete?

A ring chime sung, it was Mist&#39;s computer telling her she received a 
message. She playfully pushed her chair away from her desk and jumped 
into the centre of the room.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you whose number 83! Just you wait I&#39;m going to check out 
this disturbance then I&#39;m coming back to check the polls.&quot; I sighed in 
my head I sometimes wonder if she even knows she talking aloud to 
herself. She really does lack in the brain department.

&quot;Ja ne&quot; said Senya as Mist headed out the door.

There are too many disturbances in heaven nowadays, everyday a first 
class Valkyrie needs to go check a sector out but it always turns out to 
be nothing. I had enough paper work as it is, I don&#39;t need to go out on 
field trips. I digress; I&#39;m just in a bad mood today. I was currently 
reading applications for the second-class goddess Valkyrie trials, I 
face faulted when I saw that a girl hadn&#39;t even spell Valkyrie 
correctly...Heaven is doomed.

&quot;Do you think that it&#39;s bad that I&#39;m number 101 and yet I&#39;m the Head of 
the Valkyrie sector?&quot; Asked Senya.

&quot;It is only a number.&quot;

&quot;But still I&#39;m head, I&#39;m meant to be strong and lead. I&#39;m looking at the 
polls now, and some stupid second class that can&#39;t even memorise flight 
patterns is number 100.&quot;

&quot;A leader cannot lead on power alone, they need inner strength, courage, 
intelligence, and you have proven yourself in these areas multiple 
times.&quot; She looked at me disbelieved at first, then a small smile formed 
on her face.

&quot;I suppose I have. But I think you&#39;re a better leader than me. When is 
it your turn to be Head?&quot;

&quot;Another 3 semesters. That would be you, Alen, Mist then me.&quot;

&quot;God. Hard to believe Mist is a Head huh? I&#39;m surprised heaven hasn&#39;t 
blown up yet under her protection.&quot;

It was while ago but heaven was almost overrun by several demons. The 
demons refused to go through with the doublet system and went loose. For 
goddesses I suppose we were all fairly young, Mist, Senya and I, but at 
least Senya and I had common sense. Mist who was starting her first 
semester as Head of Valkyries decided she could tackle the demons alone. 
Suffice to say she was defeated and large sections of heaven were 
destroyed. In the end, she received a warning from Kami to be more 
careful, and a thorough scolding from Senya. I snapped out of my 
thoughts when my computer started its own melodic ring chime. I opened 
the screen to see a goddess from operations

&quot;Call from earth do you wish to accept?&quot; She asked smiling at me.

&quot;I&#39;ll accept.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Please wait a few moments and remember to use your headset.&quot; 
The screen&#39;s earth connection animation ran and I place my head set on. 
I hated wearing the headset it was always so uncomfortable on my ears, 
but it&#39;s the only way to communicate with someone on earth. I drummed my 
fingers as I waited to connect.

&quot;Moshi mosh?&quot;

&quot;First class goddess Lind speaking.&quot; I hear a faint giggling then I 
realised who was calling; my inner Lind smiled.

&quot;Lind-chan so formal.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s called work&quot; I muttered.

&quot;I know, I&#39;m at work right now. In fact that&#39;s why I called, this 
customer is being difficult, and it seems I might have to knock some 
sense into him.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s so difficult about making a wish?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, he&#39;s really dense and doesn&#39;t know what he wants. Don&#39;t 
worry I&#39;ll turn him into a real man.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I exclaimed and raised my eyebrow.

&quot;Not in that sense. Anyway I think I&#39;m going to be on earth for at least 
a month,&quot; she said and sighed loudly into the phone.

&quot;That means you won&#39;t be in heaven for two weeks and three days.&quot;

&quot;I know, but don&#39;t sulk ok?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sulking&quot; I quickly interjected. She giggled lightly again; her 
laughter, it&#39;s so enlightening to listen to.

&quot;Gomen Lind I need to go now...and I love you. Byee&quot; said Peorth then 
the line quickly cut off. I sat in my chair happy and yet shocked at the 
same time. That was the first time she said I love you to me. Of course, 
I always knew of her feelings, but to hear it was, Wow. I just want to 
keep hearing it repeatedly. I love you, such strong words that sway me 
so; I think my day just got a little bit better.

----------

My boots clicked along the white tiled floors as I made my way to the 
Healer&#39;s station. I arrived at the door and it slid open automatically. 
I wasn&#39;t given specifications, just the fact that Mist encountered 
something unexpected. Inside the station was the usual healer dressed in 
his brown robe red beret, he nodded at me and led me into a deeper more 
secluded area. It was a separate room entirely reserved for special 
cases, Mist don&#39;t tell me you did something stupid. I walked through the 
white curtains that kept the two areas separate and was welcome with the 
sight of three unconscious valkyries. I inspected each person, their 
uniforms were not ripped, they had no bruises, and no scratches, what 
was wrong with them?

&quot;Were they found like this?&quot;

&quot;Yes Lind-sama. When operations noticed that their power signals 
decreased by half they alerted us.&quot;

&quot;Do you know what did this to them?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not. All I can tell is that since their power is drained, it 
much have been a Leach. But...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot;

&quot;I gave them a restoration potion, but it was for naught. It had no 
effect&quot; he said and scratched his beard. I walked towards Mist&#39;s bed, I 
was tempted to hit her on the head or suffocate her with a pillow to 
make her wake up, but the healer wouldn&#39;t approve of my methods. How 
odd. Mist and her team are no easy tackle. Whoever or whatever did this 
must have been either very power or very clever.

Suddenly the siren rang loudly and a voice bellowed out from the 
speakers.

&quot;Entering alert state level 5. Intruder in Last block. Requesting 
immediate dispatch of Valkyries.&quot; Has the leach stuck again? Quickly I 
dashed to a computer and connected to Senya.

&quot;I&#39;m going to last block, call Alveir and Est for me.&quot;

&quot;Ok I&#39;ll call off the request good luck Lind.&quot; She logged off and I 
walked out of the room heading for Last block. The intruder wasn&#39;t going 
to escape that easily. Since the last infiltration on Heaven new 
security measures were installed. Immediate magic barriers would block 
the area off to any intruder and trap them in there until a goddess 
declared it safe. I hope this is the thing that rendered Mist 
unconscious, because if it is, my axe will strike hard.

I waited on the bridge outside of Last block. The wind blew calmly and 
the flowers swayed in response. This was the melody of the wind and 
earth spirits, both singing calm, both powerful and both beautiful. The 
spirits play their melodies together as a single unit; there is no 
competition, just playful banter. Just listening to it makes me proud 
that I am a Valkyrie.

&quot;Lind-sama!&quot; Called out two voices. Alveir and Est ran towards me and 
saluted.

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The giant doors to Last block opened, and as soon as we entered the 
tower, the doors slammed behind us. It was dark, with the only light 
illuminating from the giant pillar in the middle. Who would want to 
infiltrate this place? It is only a back up system for the 
communications system. My head snapped upwards when I heard a rustling 
noise. It was trying to move quietly but my heightened sense of hearing 
picked it up. Alveir and Est summoned their weapons and stood in 
position. We couldn&#39;t see anything it was too dark, I could barely make 
out where my team stood. Suddenly I felt a gush of wind come for me. 
Alveir and Est jumped forward into the darkness to attack the being. I 
summoned my axe and slashed what ever was aimed at me. I heard swords 
clash but then I witnessed my two Valkyries fall to the ground with a 
thump. They lay ahead of me near the pillar. This creature is no normal 
leach.

Slowly with my axe gripped tightly I walked forward. I felt another gush 
of wind come at me and again I slashed at it. A portion of the being 
fell into an illuminated area, it was a... tentacle?

The being came at me again, this time it couldn&#39;t care less about being 
quiet. It slithered loudly down the pillar and quickly dashed at me. I 
was actually surprised at its sudden swiftness. I jumped into the air 
and slammed down on its body with my axe. It roared loudly and started 
thrashing its tentacles madly in the air. There were so many, they 
started attacking me so ferociously I found it difficult to keep up. I 
cut and slashed, but more repapered until it seemed I was backed into a 
corner. The creature loomed closer, more of its body entered into the 
light.

Enough of this!

I threw my axe downwards into the pillar with great force then quickly 
raised a barrier up, and a loud massive explosion followed. The 
tentacles fell to the ground one by one, and the creature groaned out. 
That was for Mist I thought. I floated back to the ground and walked 
slowly towards it. I kept my fist infused with a thunder spell, if it 
decided to get up again.

The creature was large, blobby and purple, hardly terrifying at all. I 
stared at its large beady eyes and frowned, this is what defeated five 
warriors? Unbelievable. The creature started blinking frantically and it 
opened its mouth.

Pain shot up my back, never before had I felt pain like this, it was 
like my body was being split in two. I dropped to my knees on the ground 
and clenched my stomach tightly. I couldn&#39;t gasp or yell I was in too 
much pain. My eyes closed as the pain spread to my shoulder blades and 
onto every nerve I possessed. Then I passed out.

----------

My eyes fluttered open and bright lights shone on me. I was covered in a 
blanket and my head rested on a soft pillow. I looked around to see 
other Valkyries in beds; it seems I&#39;m in the Healer station. How did I 
get here? I closed my eyes again, the light was too bright. Then I heard 
light footsteps approach me.

&quot;Healer is nothing working on the Vakyries?&quot;

&quot;No I&#39;m afraid not Senya-sama. However, Lind is a special case. She is 
not in a vegetative state like the others.&quot; Ridiculous of course I am 
not in a vegetative state. Depite the fact my body ached I sat up and 
swung my legs over the bed.

&quot;Lind-sama get back in bed you need to rest.&quot; Said the Healer as he ran 
to my bedside.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, just tired.&quot; I smiled appreciatively at him then looked at 
Senya. She furrowed her brow and stared at all her unconscious warriors, 
then looked at me.

&quot;The creature?&quot; I asked.

&quot;It escaped onto Earth two days ago.&quot;

&quot;Two days? Quick tell me what has happened during my rest?&quot;

&quot;After your team didn&#39;t report in I sent Alen to investigate. He found 
your team unconscious then you all were quickly brought back here. With 
so many high level Valkyries defeated and injured so, I had no choice to 
issue a state of alert.&quot;

&quot;A state of alert? This creature can&#39;t be that powerful.&quot;

&quot;This creature is no powerful, it&#39;s the fact that it is an Angel eater 
that made me issue a state of alert. The labs were keeping it captive 
until it broke out and attacked them, which caused the first disturbance 
that Mist investigated.&quot;

&quot;It also explains the goddess&#39;s power loss. Without an angel, their 
powers are halved and they become unconscious because of the painful 
separation,&quot; said the Healer as he took a blanket and tucked Est in.

An angel eater was it? A large purple blob of a monster is capable of 
such cruelty? I can only imagine the pain they went through. To be 
separated from an angel is to have your entire being split in two, no 
wonder everyone is like that.

&quot;Why did the angel eater not absorb my angel?&quot;

&quot;Truthfully I&#39;m not sure myself. Just consider yourself lucky.&quot;

There is no such thing as luck, only reason and fate. I stepped out of 
bed and took a deep breath. No, I&#39;m not lucky. The reason I&#39;m awake this 
very moment because it is my duty, my fate to destroy the angel eater 
that is what I believe.

&quot;I&#39;m going to earth.&quot;

&quot;What? Don&#39;t be ridiculous! This creature is dangerous. Until we can 
come up with a proper strategy of how to defeat it...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going no matter what you say.&quot; I interrupted. Reaching out to one 
of the medicine cabinets, I grabbed a rejuvenation potion and drank it 
all. The bittersweet taste of iron ran down my throat, but my powers 
were being restored. With my strength back I headed for the door.

&quot;Lind! I cannot let you go! If you disobey my orders then you are 
risking another magic ban, or worse,&quot; yelled Senya.

&quot;I understand and accept full responsibility for my actions. However, 
I&#39;m the only one that can go to earth. The creature rejected me once it 
will do it again, so until I return do not send out teams.&quot;

The earth, the dwelling place of humans and lesser species, why am I 
drawn to it so? I understand that I&#39;m going because I have to, because 
I&#39;m the only one that can, but there&#39;s something else. I feel I need to 
go, I must go, right now that is all I understand. Orders, do not 
matter, just the urge to fulfil this want of mine to go to earth.

----------

So so enjoy? I hope you did. As you may have noticed with this Fic I&#39;m 
trying to keep in the same timeline as the Ah! my goddess manga. So 
finally we&#39;re starting the Angel eater Arc, I just watched the anime 
version Tatakau tsubasa and I loved seeing Lind all animated!! She is 
too cool.

Anyway the clever beans amoung you may have noticed why I made Peorth 
suddenly blurt out i love you on the phone. If you havent dont worry. I 
just had a brain wave whilst reading the manga and thought to include 
that bit.

Review please and the next chapter should be out soon.
