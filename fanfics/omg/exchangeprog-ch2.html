<h1>The Goddess Exchange Program (part 2 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/justjun.html">JustJun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/exchangeprog-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Earth is so quiet, not that Peorth wanted the earth to be in danger. But 
with the lord of terror over everything seemed boring now. The only 
thing that ever seemed exciting was when Chonos called everyone over to 
watch the kiss cam. It alerted everyone the moment Belledandy and Keichi 
came close to kissing but the moment was always interrupted by Skuld. 
She brushed her hair back and leant into her chair stretching out. Then 
an idea popped into her head.

&quot;Everyone, I&#39;m on break now&quot;

&quot;Hai&quot; every shouted back. Jumping out of her chair she made her way over 
to the training room. Deep inside the technological part of heaven past 
the operations, room was the portal room. As it says the room contained 
portals often used to travel to other dimensions or parts of earth when 
everyone needed to travel quickly. It was a metallic room with many 
doors along a long hallway. Peorth arrived at the training portal door, 
most likely where the Valkyrie was. She typed in her access code in the 
keyboard to the side of the door only to have it to blink the words 
&quot;OCCUPIED- ACCESS DENIED&quot; to her. Shrugging her shoulders Peorth typed 
in the override code into the computer and the door unlocked. Being the 
head of Operations really did have its perks Peorth thought as she 
walked through the portal.

She had entered into a dry mountain world, full of boulders and 
mountains, not to mention unbearable heat. Flying high into the sky 
Peorth looked for signs of destruction or explosions. A strong surge of 
energy passed her in the air and caused Peorth to stumble slightly, and 
then she heard angry yelling.

&quot;Continue! I&#39;m not giving up yet!&quot; Peorth&#39;s eyes widened in amusement, 
what could have angered the Valkyrie so much to shout. Landing on top of 
a mountain she saw Lind destroying dangerously large boulders being 
thrown at her by another Valkyrie Mist.

&quot;That&#39;s your 16th battle axe right? You&#39;ll break it.&quot; Said Mist from 
atop another mountain.

&quot;Your mistaken&quot; replied Lind.

&quot;I&#39;m not responsible if you get hurt&quot; Mist got another boulder ready 
under her foot and kicked it hard at Lind. Looking at Lind&#39;s expression, 
something was wrong. Her fighting form was correct and she destroyed the 
boulder perfectly with one swipe, but despite her confidant expression, 
Peorth knew something was wrong.

&quot;Ara, boulders aren&#39;t really a good opponent are they&quot; said Peorth as 
she descended infront of Lind.

&quot;Peorth!&quot; both the Valkyrie&#39;s exclaimed with shock.

&quot;How did you get in here? I locked the door,&quot; said Mist as she joined 
the two other goddesses on the ground.

&quot;She has the override code,&quot; said Lind as she dematerialised her axe.

&quot;Correct Lind-chan&quot;

&quot;Lind-chan?&quot; Mist giggled, &quot;You call the one winged goddess Lind-Chan. 
Haha that&#39;s too cute! Just wait till I tell everyone about this.&quot; A 
bright light shone and before Peorth or Mist had a chance to blink, Lind 
had her axe pointed at Mist&#39;s neck. A vein twitched on her head and she 
looked at Mist evilly.

&quot;Ok ok I&#39;ll keep quiet. Just put that away its not a toy!&quot; said Mist 
with slight fear in her voice.

&quot;Mist run now, I&#39;ll calm her down.&quot; Nodding eagerly Mist flew off 
quickly to the exit portal.

&quot;Lind-chan. What&#39;s the matter?&quot;

&quot;I told you don&#39;t call me Lind-chan so care freely.&quot; The smirk from 
Peorth&#39;s face quickly disappeared

&quot;No, I meant earlier. You hesitated when you destroyed that last 
boulder.&quot; Lind slammed her axe into the ground and turned away from 
Peorth.

&quot;You noticed?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Silence engulfed the two, neither wishing to express their concerns. 
This was how it always was; Peorth would patiently wait however long it 
would take until Lind would finally say what was on her mind. She didn&#39;t 
want to push the Valkyrie, if Lind needed help Peorth wanted her to seek 
it from her, only then would she open up more.

Slowly Lind turned and raised her arm up

&quot;Cool mint!&quot; Behind Lind appeared her angel in a ball of light, she was 
beautiful but only had the left right wing. The angel happily hugged her 
owner

&quot;Look at my angel, it only had one wing.&quot;

&quot;I know this already,&quot; said Peorth. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if she has one 
wing or two wings...&quot;

&quot;It does!&quot; The angel released the hug and looked sadly at Peorth. &quot;She 
has another half, there is another angel.&quot;

&quot;You have two?&quot; said Peorth shocked, even she didn&#39;t expect this.

&quot;Yes, and only when I&#39;m able to summon both of them will they finally 
become one, like a normal angel. But, I&#39;m not powerful enough to summon 
them both.&quot; Cool mint hugged her owner one more time before disappearing 
into her owners back. Lind turned to face Peorth, and for the first time 
in her life Peorth saw Lind look sad. &quot;I&#39;m not strong enough.&quot;

An evil smile formed on Peorth&#39;s face; is this woman really a goddess 
Lind thought. Suddenly Lind somersaulted into the air as Peorth lunged 
her own axe at her. Lind&#39;s eyes opened in shock and disbelief, how did 
she grab my axe so quickly and how can she even carry it? Mist can&#39;t 
even carry it!

&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; yelled Lind

&quot;Like I said before boulders aren&#39;t good opponents&quot; said Peorth, she 
rose into the air and threw the axe to Lind who caught it easily. 
Clapping her hands together, she formed a ball of energy and extended it 
as she opened her hand. The ball, thinned into a long solid form, and as 
the light faded, a grand red naginata was formed. &quot;Fight me, Lind-chan&quot;

It was obvious that Lind was the stronger goddess of the two, but still 
Peorth challenged her. The rose woman wasn&#39;t as frail at fighting as she 
looked, even being in the goddess relief service and operations for so 
long she still hadn&#39;t lost her fighting spirit. Lind chuckled to herself 
as she remembered the times Peorth had actually saved her from demons 
and monsters during their missions on the training program. Lind nodded 
her head and they both floated proudly in the air with their weapons 
held in front of them.

Lind made the first move, charging forward and lunging her axe at Peorth 
with no hesitation. Peorth grinned and blocked the attack and soon the 
two were in a tug of war, seeing who could throw who off first. Lind won 
the bout and which threw Peorth backwards, she lifted her axe to slash 
the woman to only have it blocked. They both slashed, lunged, pushed, 
pulled at each other continuously only to have it blocked every time. 
When they clashed surges of their energy was released into the 
atmosphere, the earth trembled, the sky cleared and the mountains quaked 
at the power of the two goddesses at play. This wasn&#39;t fighting; it was 
too beautiful, this was a sight which would inspire poets, musicians, 
and artists all around the world. It was them at play.

It was difficult to tell who had the upper hand exactly; equal blows had 
been dealt before they both finally flew back. Their weapons had taken 
the full brunt of the fight; both the goddesses were still immaculate.

&quot;That the best you can do?&quot; teased Peorth a smile evident on her face, 
it had been a long time since the too fought together.

&quot;Not bad, vain rose.&quot; Lind lunged forward again and swung her axe at 
Peorth, but the other goddess didn&#39;t move. Dodge! Lind thought, but then 
her axe spun out of control and Lind missed her target completely. She 
back flipped back into a standing form and looked inquisitively at her 
axe. Sure, it had gotten a few nicks and scratches, but that wouldn&#39;t 
cause it to spin. Then she saw it, somehow the handle of her axe had 
been cut short, by at least a few inches.

&quot;Hohohohoho&quot; laughed Peorth proudly &quot;Lind-chan of course if you keep 
using the same part of your axe to block it would eventually break off. 
It&#39;s not my fault your axe needs to be properly balanced in order to 
work.&quot;

&quot;Fine you win congratulations to you&quot; Lind dropped her axe and it fell 
several hundred feet down onto the earth causing a loud tremor when it 
hit.

&quot;EH! Come on! I know you have more fight in you.&quot;

&quot;I admit defeat.&quot; Not believing her, Peorth raised her naginata to 
Lind&#39;s neck

&quot;Show me your Golden eye.&quot; Normally Lind would have scolded Peorth for 
mentioning her Golden eye so casually, it wasn&#39;t something to simply 
talk about, but Peorth was in for a surprise.

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Lind calmly grabbed the sharp naginata blade and pushed it 
aside.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;There is a one day restriction placed by kami-sama.&quot; Scowling Peorth 
dematerialised her naginata, she actually looked after her weapons 
unlike Lind. Then an evil idea formed yet again in her head, her inner 
Peorth laughed maniacally in her head.

&quot;Then in that case, I&#39;ll do this&quot; Peorth slowly flew backwards and 
higher into the sky, becoming a mere dot to Lind. She raised her arms in 
front of her performing various different hand movements causing a large 
green magic circle to appear behind her. The sky suddenly filled with 
black clouds and the world darkened, a storm was brewing. It was only 
when Lind heard the rose woman&#39;s incantation did she grow scared. Peorth 
was going to unleash the wrath of an unlimited spell onto her; she can&#39;t 
its too dangerous for her! Lind thought. There was only one way to stop 
the rose woman and her crazy stunt, intercept her in the middle of the 
incantation. Flying at full speed she dashed towards Peorth.

&quot;Spirits of thunder, who race in the sky and shake the earth and air. 
With your great power become Thor&#39;s rage in my hands. You, the power 
that destroys everything!&quot; Lind was too late, thousands of thunder and 
fire bolts launched from the magic circle towards her. She dodged and 
blocked the bolts that neared her as best she could, but soon Lind was 
hit by the unlimited magic.

What was this feeling? She didn&#39;t feel pain at all despite being hit 
from all directions. She felt the energy surge throughout her reaching 
her fingertips and then she felt it; her heart beat fast, wildly, and 
powerfully. The energy was too much; she couldn&#39;t handle it, even when 
she was granted her first class goddess powers it didn&#39;t feel like this. 
The bolts were relentless continuously striking her, despite her own 
situation all Lind thought of was if Peorth could handle such magic. 
Then suddenly Cool mint appeared and Lind clenched her stomach as pain 
invaded her back. A spiral of light appeared from Lind&#39;s back; it formed 
a mirror image of cool mint but soon disappeared back into Lind. Return, 
was the last thing Lind thought before fainting and crashing to the 
ground.

&quot;Lind! Lind! Wake up!&quot; What is this annoying voice slowly Lind opened 
her eyes again she was granted the sight of someone&#39;s cleavage, Peorth&#39;s 
she soon realised. She quickly flailed her arms

&quot;Yokatta&quot; and despite Lind&#39;s attempts at escape she was embraced in a 
tight hug. At first, the Valkyrie not used to such displays of affection 
tried to push Peorth away, but as soon as she saw that the rose woman 
had teared up she soon returned the hug. Lind definitely wouldn&#39;t have 
done that before she befriended Peorth. She soon pulled back from her 
teary eyed companion

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Lind!&quot; said Peorth as she bowed her head &quot;I thought if we did 
energy transfer you would get more powerful like you wanted, it worked 
but then I saw you fall.&quot;

&quot;Energy transfer? Oh, that explains the situation then&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry was it painful?&quot;

&quot;No. It was an engulfing warmth...I saw them&quot; said Lind with a grand 
smile. &quot;I saw them!&quot;

&quot;It worked?&quot; Exclaimed Peorth with surprise, even she had her doubts 
about her plan. Lind nodded in earnest, and it was then that Peorth 
realised that even without a thanks Lind&#39;s smile was the best reply she 
could ever want.

They rested for several moments more before deciding to have lunch, on 
Lind. Their recovery was surprisingly quick seeing as they used so much 
energy.

&quot;hohohoho am I not a genius?&quot;

&quot;Just a momentary moment.&quot;

&quot;I gave you my energy just now be grateful.&quot;

&quot;Hai, hai arigato vain rose&quot; replied Lind.

&quot;I don&#39;t want your thanks I want presents, massages and my precious 
roses, and stop calling me Vain rose. I am more like humble rose.&quot;

The list went on about how Peorth wanted a reward for her selfless act 
and Lind just kept replying yes without any thought about what the woman 
was actually talking about. All Lind was thinking about was when the 
next battle would be.
