Thank goodness I managed to outsmart Mist when I did. If she started 
talking anymore Peorth might get curious and start asking me questions. 
Of course they both don&#39;t know about my suspension but if curious enough 
they both have their own way of finding out things. I need to remember 
when my suspension is over I&#39;m making Mist suffer for interrupting our 
date and stressing out Peorth. It&#39;s a shame Peorth doesn&#39;t become as 
calm as me after eating ramen, if she did she wouldn&#39;t have stressed as 
much about Mist.

Oh well she&#39;s over it now. After a vigorous round of shopping it seems 
I&#39;ve become a pack mule. Altogether, I believe I&#39;m carrying 29 shopping 
bags, I don&#39;t know how but I am, it seems Peorth is using my Valkyrie 
strength for the wrong reasons. If I was with anyone else I believe I 
wouldn&#39;t be enjoying myself, I would get bored of them, or they would 
get bored of me; but shopping with Peorth is nice. However...I can feel 
a dark presence nearby. At first I suspected it to be Skuld or Urd since 
they&#39;re always so nosey but the energy pattern I sense isn&#39;t that of a 
god. The frequency is like a sharp aura of pure evil, a blackness that 
had enough power to overshadow then sun; it has to be a demon. How odd, 
Demons usually like to make a big scene, but this one is stalking us, as 
if it&#39;s waiting for an opportunity. I&#39;ll see how this turns out.

&quot;Lind I think Belldandy is about to finish her shift at the store why 
don&#39;t we walk home with her?&quot;

&quot;Of course&quot; Safety in numbers I suppose. We walked to the store and the 
doors slid open. I sense it! The demon frequency it&#39;s strong here, the 
demon must be in this very store.

&quot;Peorth&quot; I whispered

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;We are in the presence of an evil being&quot;

&quot;The store? I know the prices are ridiculous but it&#39;s not evil&quot;

&quot;Welcome&quot; said the clerk as she walked up to us. That blond hair, those 
sharp fangs, those demons marks! Mara! On instinct, I dropped the bags 
and assumed my battle position. After what she did last time she&#39;s not 
getting away easily

&quot;COME FORTH GREAT ICE SPEAR! THE LANCE OF.........&quot; I froze immediately; 
I can&#39;t use my magic. Great. The people in the shop stared at me and 
Mara cowered, whilst Peorth just shook her head.

&quot;Eh?! Why am I still alive?!&quot; said Mara frantically as she touched her 
face. I was still frozen in my stance but Peorth brought my hand down 
and closed my mouth so I looked somewhat normal apart from the 
expression on my face.

&quot;Lind I forgot to tell you that Mara works at this store as well. We 
don&#39;t bother each other when we&#39;re off goddess and demon duty,&quot; said 
Peorth as she patted my back.

&quot;Mara!&quot; I yelled authoritatively.

&quot;HAI!&quot; she said and saluted.

&quot;Be grateful I have decided to be merciful. I am off Valkyrie duty right 
now so you will receive your punishment at a later date&quot;

&quot;Thank you Lind-sama!...wait why am I saying thank you for a 
punishment?&quot; she stomped off into the staff room and soon the people in 
the store went about as normal. I picked up the bags as Belldandy 
emerged.

&quot;Oh hello you two&quot; she said happily.

&quot;We thought we&#39;d walk home with you,&quot; said Peorth.

&quot;Wonderful, oh let me invite Mara to dinner.&quot; Mara immediately warped in 
front of the till with a wide smile

&quot;Belldandy&#39;s cooking! I&#39;d love to come,&quot; she said enthusiastically, and 
then she turned to look at me and she face faulted. I&#39;m not particularly 
found of Mara, in fact I&#39;m not fond of any demon; I suppose it&#39;s my 
nature as a Valkyrie. &quot;Perhaps another time Bell-chan&quot; she said.

&quot;Peorth let&#39;s go...oof!&quot; I said as Peorth elbowed me in the ribs.

&quot;Invite Mara to dinner&quot; whispered Peorth

&quot;But she was involved in the plot which stole your angel and she&#39;s a 
demon&quot;

&quot;I know I know; these things happen. I break her CD she breaks mine, she 
steals my angel I steal hers, everything balances out in the end.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to steal her angel? Oof!&quot; She elbowed me again and gave me 
a look that meant I was going to get whip tortured if I didn&#39;t do what 
she wanted.

&quot;Mara...come to dinner&quot; I said gritting my teeth, I didn&#39;t sound 
convincing but then again I never sound convincing.

&quot;Really! Ok I&#39;ll see you all after my shift then&quot; she said happily.

We left the store and made our way back home. I don&#39;t understand how 
Peorth can have no grudge towards Mara, is this Belldandy&#39;s influence? 
No matter, I&#39;m going to keep a close watch on Mara; a demon is a demon. 
One good deed cannot overshadow a lifetime of evil. It is my duty as a 
Valkyrie...I suppose I can&#39;t say that anymore. It is my duty as Peorth&#39;s 
girlfriend to ensure her safety. Mara I&#39;m keeping an eye on you.

----------

Keiichi met us on the road on his motor bike and took Belldandy the rest 
of the way home, he felt guilty for deserting us but we insisted we 
wanted to walk.

&quot;I have to say Lind apart from the ring incident and you almost 
summoning a restricted level spell this date has gone pretty well&quot; said 
Peorth sweetly.

&quot;That man was flirting with you, I had to intervene&quot; I muttered.

&quot;He was flirting with me? Really? I didn&#39;t notice&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot; She laughed loudly like she always does in that refined manner 
of hers and used her magic to teleport all the bags away. The bags 
weren&#39;t heavy but I still stretched my arms out. She held my hand and we 
walked together with out steps in sync. &quot;This is nice.&quot;

&quot;What is?&quot; she asked.

&quot;This&quot; I said as I squeezed her hand lightly &quot;No powers, no 
responsibilities, no rankings or restrictions. It&#39;s just us.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve never actually spent a whole day together have we?&quot;

&quot;No, we only ever have mornings, lunches or nights.&quot;

&quot;You know I love spending my day with you, I can&#39;t remember my life 
without you in it...Do you think we&#39;ll always be like this, so carefree 
and happy?&quot; she said shakily.

&quot;Peorth...&quot;

&quot;I mean I love life here on earth. It&#39;s so peaceful and we&#39;re together 
without any interruptions. But life won&#39;t always be like this will it?&quot;

Sensing something was wrong I stopped walking and pulled her into my 
arms and she held onto me tightly her head resting on my shoulder.

&quot;Do you doubt us?&quot; I said softly.

&quot;I don&#39;t have doubt; we&#39;ll always be together. But I&#39;m scared, I was so 
scared when the angel eater came. I kept thinking what if you&#39;re hurt or 
injured? What if something happened to you? I was so worried; I wouldn&#39;t 
be able to live if something happened to you.&quot; I hadn&#39;t expected this in 
all honesty. I asked her yesterday if she needed to talk about what 
happened, but Peorth as usual brushed it off like it was nothing. I 
thought she was fine; obviously not. I still have much to learn about 
her.

&quot;I was worried about you too,&quot; I whispered. She raised her head and 
looked at me with teary eyes.

&quot;I can&#39;t take it anymore Lind. I hate it when you go on missions; I 
never know if I&#39;m going to see you again. Then when I don&#39;t know where 
you are or if I hear something has gone wrong, I can&#39;t focus and I worry 
so much. Neh can we just stay here on earth and forget our duties? Can 
you just be Lind and I Peorth?&quot; She&#39;s not being serious, this is her 
hysteria and worry talking right now not Peorth.

&quot;We can&#39;t and you know it&quot; I said calmly and stroked her back. &quot;We are 
goddesses; we knew the moment we accepted our first class ranking that 
our jobs wouldn&#39;t be easy. There are tough times and we make tough 
choices, life changing decisions, but look at the end result. So many 
millions of people are safe, happy, and love their lives because of what 
we do. Without us, without goddesses, where would those lost sheep be? 
It is our duty to put other people&#39;s happiness before our own, we must 
be selfless, and make people happy. I know this isn&#39;t my division or 
speciality but I&#39;m going to make you as happy as I can Peorth.&quot; She held 
me tightly once again as she wept softly on my shoulder, I stroked her 
head. It was a soft sort of weeping of acceptance. &quot;I&#39;ll take on less 
dangerous missions and report to you before I leave and when I come back 
to heaven. I&#39;ll even wear my microphone during missions just in case you 
need to contact me. I&#39;ll do everything I can so you don&#39;t worry and are 
happy. How does that sound?&quot;


&quot;It sounds great...Lind, I love you you know?&quot; she said and pulled back 
from me. I could feel the blood rushing to my face and I gulped. Another 
side effect of being in love, you act like a complete fool whenever they 
say I love you. She wiped her tears away and somehow despite the fact 
that her hair was messy and her eyes were slightly puffy, she&#39;s still 
wonderfully beautiful.

&quot;Of course I know&quot; I said and smiled. She tilted her head and closed her 
eyes and I met her in a kiss. Her lips are always so soft; it leaves me 
always wanting more. But despite my urges I take my time to kiss her 
with such gentleness that will convey all of my feelings. From this, she 
will know I love her. We pulled back and smiled at each other, we both 
were blushing lightly. That kiss was passionate, we&#39;ve had kisses full 
of passion, lust, and kisses full of affection, but that that was so 
much more, it was like our very souls were touching. I know I&#39;m not the 
only one that thinks this because she smiling, grinning even.

&quot;Anyhow you don&#39;t have to worry about me. I&#39;m suspended...&quot;

&quot;Until the new semester I know&quot; interjected Peorth.

It took us both a while to register what we said but when we did my 
mouth dropped and she looked extremely guilty.

&quot;I didn&#39;t tell you about being suspended,&quot; I said folding my arms in 
mild anger and irritation. &quot;Did you access the Valkyrie files again?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes? Don&#39;t be mad I was worried&quot;

&quot;Peorth how many times have I told you not to use my password for the 
Valkyrie files? Its top secret only the top ranked Valkrie&#39;s have access 
to it.&quot;

&quot;Ok I&#39;m sorry, but I knew the council wouldn&#39;t let you off easy. Besides 
I know what you&#39;re like, you would bring at least a little bit of work 
with you if you were really on holiday.&quot; She really does know me too 
well; it&#39;s not a bad thing I suppose, its saves a lot of time explaining 
things.

&quot;...Fine I suppose I accept your apology, let&#39;s just go home now.&quot; 
Peorth smiled evilly and flicked her hair and before I knew it all of 
the shopping bags reappeared on my arms. &quot;Oi! What&#39;s the meaning of 
this?&quot; I said impatiently.

&quot;Well Lind-Chan since you can&#39;t use magic I&#39;m essentially the more 
powerful person in the relationship so I can decide what happens&quot;

&quot;Remove these bags at once&quot;

&quot;What the great mighty Valkyrie can&#39;t carry a few shopping bags? Oh my I 
might have to tell Mist-San and Senya-San&quot;

&quot;Of course I can carry a few shopping bags this is nothing...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s settled then.&quot; Damn it she tricked me again! With a great 
determination, I arranged the bags so I could at least see and caught up 
with Peorth.

&quot;You didn&#39;t give my password out did you?&quot;

&quot;No of course not! Honestly what do you think of me?&quot; she said in a 
melodramatic tone. I suppose I&#39;ll have to believe her. I suppose this is 
my life until the new semester starts, I&#39;m a Valkyrie pack mule, but I 
think I&#39;m going to have fun.

----------

Back at home dinner occurred without any threats or mass destruction of 
the world on Mara&#39;s part, so it was a successful dinner I suppose. We 
all sat in the living room, Urd and Skuld arguing over the remote and 
Belldandy and Peorth engaged in conversation. Keiichi was outside, I 
think I heard him crying, I believe Skuld did something to his motorbike 
again...Poor man. Everything seemed to be normal but then I felt a dark 
impulse. Did no one else sense it? Can no one feel that utter surge of 
power? It&#39;s the same power, the same one as before! Damn it was stalking 
us. I quickly stood up and opened the doors to the garden.

&quot;Lind, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; exclaimed Belldandy.

&quot;Shh, it comes.&quot; The power surged and grew stronger as if it was coming 
towards us, then it stopped and remained stationary. Why has it stopped? 
Unless...It&#39;s above us! &quot;Everyone watch out!!&quot; I yelled as a blinding 
powerful light emitted from the sky above the house. Everyone ducked and 
hid as the power descended onto the garden. I tried to open my eyes but 
as I did a great force hit me and threw be back into a wall.

&quot;Lind!&quot; everyone shouted. I couldn&#39;t respond, I was in too much pain. 
Damn I&#39;m weak. They all rushed towards me and helped me stand. Belldandy 
confidently walked directly into the garden and towards the bright 
light.

&quot;Please identify yourself, by order of first class goddess Belldandy.&quot; 
The light dimmed and the person became visible. It was a man, a god; he 
wore the celestial robes of a high-ranking official. A mixture of white 
and blood red material draped over him covering his signel on his chest 
so I couldn&#39;t identify him. His body was adorned in rings, bracelets and 
earrings; all restrictors so his real power won&#39;t be released. He had 
long brown hair tied up loosely with a rough beard; his eyes looked 
menacingly at me. Is he out to kill me?

&quot;High Seraph Ciel of the Valkyries. Unlimited, Unrestricted class.&quot; My 
mind refused to accept such a thing, the High Seraph of the Valkyries in 
front of me, in person? There are only seven Seraphs, and he is one of 
them?! They, they are unknown! Their identities are kept hidden. Not 
even people in their own councils know its Seraph&#39;s identity.

&quot;...Father...what are you doing here?&quot; gasped Peorth.

&quot;WHAT!&quot; screamed Skuld and Urd. Indeed what! Peorth&#39;s father is the high 
seraph! This, this is the man that has decided my fate all those times I 
stepped into the council. Peorth&#39;s father is my boss!!

&quot;I am here to eliminate Valkyrie Lind,&quot; he said viciously.

----------

Dun dun dunnnnnnn!! Oh boy I just had to add drama after happy fluff 
didn&#39;t I?
