<a href="../omg/exchangeprog-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Peorth

Wahhh how am I going to get Keiichi to become brave enough to tell 
Belldandy he loves her? I&#39;ve tried so many methods already, and there 
have been so many distractions. Be it nice distractions like his parents 
visiting. His mother...That woman is the queen of mah-jong, she scares 
me. To defeat myself, Urd and skuld in games that are our forte! What 
amazing power she has. Keiichi&#39;s father was adorable he even gave each 
of us a feather pendant. I&#39;ve kept it in a drawer in my room. Correct I 
have a room; Belldandy thought since I visit for so long I might as well 
have my own Peorth palace. It&#39;s lovely but I do miss Heaven among other 
things.

I wonder what Lind is doing now. Probably teaching a student how to fly 
or stabbing her paperwork with her pen. I miss her, being on holiday, I 
mean work, isn&#39;t as fun without her. This time difference is horrible. 
There is roughly a one to two ratio of Heaven to earth days, give or 
take a few hours. I think the last time I talked to Lind was six earth 
days ago and until Keiichi confesses his feelings, I won&#39;t be leaving 
anytime soon. I love my work and the time I spend here but I envy the 
amount of time Belldandy gets to spend with her loved one.

----------

I walked through the hallways and slid open the doors to the living 
room. There floating in front of the TV was Urd, and Skuld was sitting 
at the table with a screwdriver and a circuit board.

&quot;Did I miss the opening to My husband?&quot; I asked as I sat down at the 
table and poured myself a cup of tea.

&quot;Yes but don&#39;t worry, you didn&#39;t miss much. Yuichiro is just about to 
meet Sakura&#39;s father.&quot; replied Urd as she sat down properly on the floor 
and didn&#39;t float for once. I suppose it&#39;s because she knows I watch 
these shows unlike Skuld and doesn&#39;t mind sharing the TV.

&quot;Bah! I don&#39;t know how you two enjoy this drama&quot; blurted Skuld as she 
put on a large pair of goggles and was now welding things to the circuit 
board. I find it hard to believe that Skuld is a leader of the Operation 
just like Urd and I. Her intelligence does make up for her lack of 
power, but in time she&#39;ll become as amazing as her sisters. She stopped 
welding and now put the circuit board into a small remote, Urd and I 
watched her and we prepared to put up a barrier just in case of an 
explosion, but surprisingly nothing happened. She pointed the remote at 
the TV and pressed several buttons. The TV went static for a few seconds 
then it turned onto a channel. This looks familiar I noted as I took a 
sip of my tea. I almost spat it out at Urd when I realised what Skuld 
had changed the channel too.

&quot;You hacked into the Yggdrasil system?!&quot;

&quot;Good isn&#39;t it?&quot; Said Skuld with pride. &quot;Now we can know what&#39;s going on 
in Heaven without having to go there all the time.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the point Skuld?&quot; asked Urd as she grabbed the remote and 
changed the channel back to the drama.

&quot;Remember that time you and I had to go to heaven and onee-sama was 
sick? I&#39;m not letting that happen again!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t be sick again you don&#39;t need to worry about her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried about onee-sama I&#39;m worried about Keiichi! Who knows 
what he might do to her next time!&quot; Determination was in Skuld&#39;s eyes 
and she stole the remote again then left the room muttering something 
about making Banpei-kunmore protective of her onee-sama against Keiichi. 
The door slid closed and Urd and I looked at each other, then sighed 
loudly.

&quot;I&#39;m happy at times I don&#39;t have a little sister&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just happy she&#39;s not this obsessive about me and my relationships&quot; 
said Urd.

&quot;Well I suppose she was too young to interfere when you were dating 
Troubadour.&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness for that! If she did interfere he would only fight back 
with curses and songs.&quot; We both laughed and I saw outside Belldandy had 
summoned Holybell. I motioned for Urd to get up and we entered the 
garden and summoned our own angels. World of elegance stretched out her 
arms and Gorgeous rose hugged me.

&quot;Hello everyone, I haven&#39;t seen you in a while,&quot; said Belldandy looking 
at our angels. They smiled at her as they started talking to Holybell in 
the own silent angel language.

&quot;Oh hosting a tea party are we?&quot; Asked Urd.

&quot;Yes, I bought some western style tea this morning and thought it would 
be nice to have some out in the garden. Care to join me?&quot;

&quot;Of course&quot; I replied and sat myself down.

What a beautiful day it is. The sun is shining, the wind is blowing 
lightly and the flowers are singing softly. What&#39;s more this western tea 
was rather good, thought nothing can beat my regular Japanese tea.

We all smiled at each other

&quot;Is keiichi not joining us?&quot; I asked.

&quot;No because I requested him not too.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; said Urd in mock surprise.

&quot;It has been a while since us three have had some quality time, so I 
asked him not too.&quot;

&quot;We must let our angels enjoy themselves like this more often,&quot; I said.

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right since their all gathered here like this,&quot; said 
Belldandy happily.

&quot;I&#39;d like to go do some research, but I suppose it can wait.&quot;

&quot;I think if Keiichi joined us he might feel a bit overwhelmed with our 
angels out&quot; said Belldandy. Gorgeous rose and World of elegance giggled 
at the statement, they knew it was true. Our angels love teasing him as 
much as we do at times.

&quot;What a lucky man to be adored by so many goddesses, he probably doesn&#39;t 
even know how lucky he is&quot; said Urd.

&quot;I consider myself lucky to be with him as well,&quot; She elegantly took a 
sip of her tea then smiled widely at me. &quot;What about you Peorth? Do you 
think you are lucky to be Lind?&quot; I blushed slightly at the statement, 
not that I was embarrassed about our relationship but I wasn&#39;t used to 
people asking me about it. I nodded then took a big gulp of tea.

&quot;I have no significant other so I can&#39;t compete with you two,&quot; sighed 
Urd.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Nee-san someone is waiting for you.&quot; Thank goodness the 
conversation has shifted off me.

&quot;Yes someone is waiting for me just like how Peorth is waiting for 
Lind&#39;s call.&quot; I take my statement back.

&quot;I&#39;m not waiting for any call.&quot; She raised her eyebrow at me and 
Belldandy smiled knowingly. Am I that obvious with my emotions? &quot;Fine. I 
am waiting for her call. I just haven&#39;t talked to her in a while.&quot; 
Gorgeous Rose hugged me tightly and smiled, it&#39;s not only me that misses 
Lind a lot.

&quot;It&#39;s Lind, she will call back immediately the moment she can. I&#39;m sure 
of it.&quot; I smiled and noticed World of elegance disappeared back into Urd 
as she walked up to an unsuspecting Skuld. The child was holding her 
angel egg and was staring at it intensely. Belldandy and I both got up 
and our angels disappeared as well.

&quot;Whatcha saying!? I know my power is still too low!&quot; shouted Skuld.

&quot;It&#39;s not that your power is too low. You simply haven&#39;t integrated with 
your angel yet. You must make the decision to always walk with your 
angel&quot; I said to Skuld. If Urd told her this, her temperament would only 
worsen. It seems she listens a bit more to me than Urd.

&quot;And you must feel that you truly want to meet your angel. You should 
not want to meet you angel because you envy others.&quot;

&quot;Onee-sama I...&quot;

A great whirlwind formed above us and caused almost everything in the 
area to tremble. The force was so immense, I could sense that it could 
easily over power myself and Urd, perhaps even Belldandy.

&quot;Something of great power descends&quot;

&quot;Not another demon!&quot; Yelled skuld.

&quot;No, this is a god. But also I fear from the combat division&quot; said 
Belldandy. I know this power. I feel I know it all too well. I closed my 
eyes and tuned into the force closing in on us.

&quot;It&#39;s Lind&quot; I whispered. No doubt about it I know its her.

----------

A great light beamed down from the skies and it exploded upon impact 
with the earth. The light soon disappeared and Lind appeared before us, 
proud and tall as always when on duty. She missed me that much did she?

&quot;First class Goddess, Special duty Limited, Reporting&quot; stated Lind 
clearly with her arms straight by her side like the professional 
Valkyrie she is.

&quot;......Who is that?&quot; Asked Skuld. Urd and I almost fell from shock. I 
suppose Skuld has only met my dear Lind once for a brief moment during 
the Lord of terror incident.

&quot;You don&#39;t know who the Fighting wings are?!&quot; I almost shouted.

&quot;With fighting as her speciality, even amongst the Valkyrie&#39;s she&#39;s a 
goddess of extreme violence. Their training is so intense that there are 
less then fifty first class goddess Valkyries in all of Heaven and Lind 
is one of the most powerful of them all. And her angel only has one wing 
that must mean some abnormal occurrence occurred,&quot; Little Skuld&#39;s mouth 
was agape listening to us. I was in a teasing sort of mood so I bent 
down and whispered into Skuld&#39;s ear

&quot;She&#39;s also my girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;EHHHHHHH!&quot; She yelled her eyes wide with shock. I winked at Lind but 
she pretended not to notice me.

&quot;Anything that got here in the last 24hours or anything suspicious, 
bring it forth now!&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; shouted Urd, Skuld and I. We each dashed back into the house 
then grabbed things from our room then ran back outside to Lind. Why am 
I following her orders so frantically? It must be the influence of 
staying with this family for so long.

&quot;Even this dobon I bought today?&quot; Asked Skuld.

&quot;Yes that&#39;s right.&quot; Skuld sighed loudly then threw it into the pile of 
items, muttering about she hadn&#39;t even read the ending yet.

&quot;Even this rose I just got from a secret admirer?&quot; I asked. Her eye 
twitched slightly then she took the rose from me and threw it onto the 
pile.

&quot;Especially items like that.&quot; I giggled lightly; she&#39;s so easy to tease.

&quot;Even this mandragora I bought at a sale?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t admire you for buying that you know. It&#39;s illegal in this 
dimension, but I will overlook that fact right now.&quot; After all our new 
items were placed in the garden and after Skuld and Urd had most of 
their possessions taken away from them Lind finally alerted us of the 
situation.

&quot;The angel eater has escaped Heaven and is on earth, most likely in this 
location because it is drawn to all of your strong angels.&quot;

&quot;THE ANGEL EATER THE MYTHICAL BEAST THAT EATS ANGELS?!&quot; Yelled Urd.

&quot;Correct&quot; said Lind calmly.

&quot;HOW&#39;D THEY GET PAST THE GUARDS?!&quot;

&quot;Unknown.&quot;

&quot;ARE ANGELS DELICIOUS?!&quot; Yelled Skuld.

&quot;I&#39;m not an angel eater so I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Lind stepped forward and raised her hands in preparation for a spell. 
Her signel lit up on the ground and it glowed a light blue colour.

&quot;I&#39;m going to establish a quarantine area here. Going in and out of the 
Morisato residence is prohibited. Anyone who passes through the boundary 
will be unconditionally sealed&quot; said Lind. In a flash, a giant dome 
appeared over us and as soon as it appeared, it vanished. I&#39;m sometimes 
astounded at her skills, to create such a high level barrier in a manner 
of seconds is no easy feat.

&quot;But what if we were to do a dimensional jump?&quot; Asked Belldandy.

&quot;If there is interference from a dimensional jump then an alarm will 
sound.&quot; With her eyes closed, Lind floated over to the deck and sat 
down, hugging her knees to her chest with her arms.

&quot;Now I shall stand by.&quot;

We all looked at each other with wide eyes. Keichi and Skuld looked 
confused, whilst Belldandy, Urd and I were just worried.

&quot;Your girlfriend is weird Peorth&quot; said Skuld.

----------

Everyone left to do their own things, eventually leaving me alone with 
Lind. I have to say even for Lind her behaviour is a bit weird right 
now. I sat down on the deck next to her, swinging my legs and whistling 
softly. Seconds passes, then minutes, then my eye twitched slightly in 
frustration. Why won&#39;t she pay attention to me?

&quot;Lindddd&quot; I whined, but she didn&#39;t move. &quot;Lind!&quot; I said louder. I turned 
to face her and poked her in the arm. When she didn&#39;t move again I 
prodded her hard on her stomach, but still nothing. I was going to yell 
at her; however, I noticed she was breathing faintly. Oh my, is Lind 
asleep on duty? I leant in closer and listened

&quot;Zzzzz&quot; Yes indeed she is asleep. My inner Peorth started to laugh 
evilly. Lind always wakes me up because she&#39;s such an early riser, the 
times that I do manage to wake up before her I tease her mercilessly. 
Chance! I leant in as close as I could to her head and put my lips next 
to her ear.

&quot;Lind-Koi, w-a-k-e u-p&quot; I whispered emphasising each syllable on 
purpose. Then I slowly trailed my hand up her back, stopping at the base 
of her shoulder blades before trickling back down. Her eyes immediately 
opened and her head shot up.

&quot;Wahh! Angel eater!&quot; she yelled from shock. Success. She eventually 
stopped looking around frantically and realised I was sitting next to 
her.

&quot;Hiiii&quot; I said and smiled angelically. She frowned at me but then 
relaxed and we both started laughing. When she smiled I always feel so 
euphoric because I realise I&#39;m the one that has made her smile. No one 
in the entire universe can do that apart from me.

&quot;I fell asleep.&quot;

&quot;Yes you did, so I thought I should wake you up because you weren&#39;t 
paying any attention to me.&quot;

&quot;Not because I&#39;m meant to be protecting everyone right now?&quot;

&quot;Nope. I&#39;m your number one priority.&quot;

&quot;How selfless of you&quot; she joked.

I looked in her eyes and somehow we both knew what we needed. She 
wrapped her arms around me and I hugged her waist. My head rested on her 
shoulder whilst her head rested on mine. A hug can say a lot for us, it 
can mean forgive me, stay with me, help me, I need you, and I love you. 
Right now, it certainly means the last two. It&#39;s been too long since the 
last time I&#39;ve held onto Lind like this or inhaled her scent of faint 
mint.

Suddenly the door behind us burst open and flew past us at an incredible 
speed. We both jumped up and faced the door. From the smoke all I could 
see we a small figure with an obscure head and what looked like a gun. 
Do angel eaters use guns?

&quot;Keiichi! You&#39;ve really done it this time! No one is touching 
onee-sama!&quot; Oh dear god please tell me this isn&#39;t happening. Hearing the 
voice Lind and I shook our heads and sighed deeply. The smoke cleared 
and out emerged an angry looking Skuld with yes a large gun and an 
obscure helmet with large goggles. She pointed the gun at Lind then 
looked around furiously.

&quot;Where is he you two?&quot;

&quot;Not here&quot; replied Lind.

&quot;Oh I know he&#39;s here somewhere! My kiss-o-meter levels were skyrocketing 
in this area just now.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why...&quot; I muttered as I folded my arms. No wonder nothing 
happens with Keiichi and Belldandy, this child has some super detecting 
affection machine. Note to self- destroy machine.

Behind Skuld walked forward Belldandy and Keiichi who started crying 
about the broken doors. &quot;Skuld what are you doing.&quot;

&quot;Protecting you from this beast onee-sama. And now that I&#39;ve found him&quot; 
she said eagerly. She snapped her goggles into place and pressed a giant 
red button on the gun and pointed at Keiichi. Suffice to say she chased 
him around the entire house. It was all fun and games really until Skuld 
let forth a scream of pure terror. Immediately we ran to her to see her 
bent over Urdwho was lying on the floor. She lay there with an 
expression on her face like she was half alive half dead.

&quot;What happened here?&quot; Asked Keiichi. Lind and Belldandy motioned for 
Keiichi and Skuld to let them inspect Urd. Belldandy placed her hand 
over Urd heads and checked Urd&#39;s vitals.

&quot;Her angel has been pulled out,&quot; said Belldandy.

&quot;This is the work of the angel eater.&quot;

&quot;Will she be alright?&quot; Asked Skuld.

&quot;There is no immediate danger to her life but we cannot leave her like 
this for long. We goddesses and our angels are of one mind and body, if 
we are forcibly pulled apart our bodies will go into shock.&quot;

&quot;To deal with the great loss of power we goddesses go into an emergency 
vegetativestate. This way we can survive for longer without our angel as 
we consume much less energy then if we are awake&quot; said Lind. Skuld and 
Keiichi nodded in understanding; hopefully nothing will happen to those 
two.

&quot;This must be the plot of a demon. Otherwise who else would dare target 
goddesses?&quot; I said.

&quot;I agree&quot; said Belldandy &quot;for harm to come to Urd here...&quot;

&quot;Means either something invaded here just now or...it was already here 
right from the start. In any case we must search for the Angel eater and 
salvage the stolen angels soon otherwise we won&#39;t be able to return 
them.&quot;

The clock chimed loudly, it was already five o&#39;clock. How much time have 
we wasted not searching?

&quot;We must refrain from summoning our angels so we won&#39;t be attacked&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t Urd do something as simple as that then?&quot; Said Skuld. She&#39;s 
right. Urd isn&#39;t so stupid to simply summon her angel when an angel 
eater is on the prowl. She is known to throw thunderbolts at people for 
fun, but she&#39;s not silly as to summon her angel. What&#39;s going on here?

&quot;Keiichi can you get a pillow and futon?&quot; Asked Belldandy. She picked 
Urd up using her magic and lay her down properly on the futon and pillow 
Keiichi quickly laid out. We closed the doors behind us as we left the 
room

&quot;I shall stand by outside. Peorth, Belldandy be careful,&quot; stated Lind 
with a hint of fear in her voice. If Lind sounds scared then this is 
really a dangerous situation. In the corner of my eye I saw Skuld frown 
and she clutched her angel egg pendant in her hand. Skuld if you still 
want your angel even in such a situation we&#39;re in, your getting one-step 
closer to meeting her again.

&quot;Skuld do you want to help me? I&#39;m going to go through the goddess 
database for information about this creature,&quot; I asked and smiled hoping 
it would cheer her up.

&quot;No thanks Peorth, I&#39;m going to go make something that will help!&quot; she 
said as she dashed off towards her room. Well it looks like she needs no 
cheering up from me.

I turned around to see the distancing form of my Lind and sighed 
lightly. Does she even know what danger she&#39;s in just by trying to 
protect us? Does she even know the amount of danger she&#39;s in every day 
when she goes out for missions. Does she think about how much I worry? 
Being a Valkyrie is her life; and all I can sully what she loves to do 
with my silly worries. But sometimes the fact that her mission comes 
before me annoys me slightly.

----------

I shrugged my shoulders and headed into the living room and sat down in 
front of the TV. I opened a portal into the Yggdrasil system using my 
keycode. Ha! Who needs Skuld&#39;s little remote when you have the key code! 
Quickly I opened up all the sources I could find about the Angel eater. 
It seemed I was so immersed in my research that I didn&#39;t hear someone 
enter the room. A strong hand held onto my shoulder and spun me around 
quickly. Blue hair spun in front of me in a swirl.

&quot;Lind what are you...&quot; I tried to say but she quickly kissed me. I 
closed my eyes and returned the kiss; we both need this. What started 
off as gentle touches and caresses soon became strong, demanding, 
powerful kisses of dominance that made my heartbeat 1000miles and hour. 
Her hands trailed through my hair and she pulled me closer to her body. 
I was soaring through a clear blue sky and she was holding my hand and 
leading the way, it was incredible.

I let out a moan of protest when she pulled away but it was probably for 
the best, we can&#39;t continue when there&#39;s an angel eater on the loose. 
She held my hand and slowly stood up.

&quot;Peorth...I won&#39;t let anything happen to you...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine&quot; I quickly interrupted.

&quot;But if anything happens to you...&quot; I quickly tugged on her hand and 
pulled her down slightly, and then I kissed her lips once more, softly, 
reassuring her that I would be fine. I smiled at her contently and she 
headed for the door.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take some time off after this mission to spend more time 
with you,&quot; she said with her back facing me and then she quickly left.

She closed the door behind her and I grinned madly. Did that really 
happen? Did Lind just tell me she was going to take time off work, to 
spend time with me? This is like a dream come true, again. The first 
dream was being with Lind to begin with, but this is a new dream. 
Actually what am I babbling about? Holiday with Lind!!

No Peorth focus! First priority research the angel eater then plan 
holiday with Lind. I shook my head and focused on the screen; I floated 
up into the air and wondered where we should visit. Perhaps earth? Or 
another dimension? The beach! No, Lind wouldn&#39;t wear a swimsuit. 
Suddenly Gorgeous rose appeared from my back.

&quot;What?! Gorgeous rose you can&#39;t come out!&quot;

I heard a sharp shrill cry that pierced my soul. She immediately flew to 
the source of the noise and was engulfed by a monster. Such pain. I&#39;ve 
never felt anything like this before. Feathers scattered through the air 
like raindrops and I collapsed to the ground with a thud.

I realise now, its not that Urd summoned her angel, it&#39;s that she could 
not control her. It&#39;s that noise. My mind faded in and out of 
consciousness, and then I lost all thought suddenly. I&#39;m sorry Lind.

BONUS!!

Omake!!

1)- Resume the door bursting open scene

Peorth: Lind is it the angel eater?

Lind: No its much stronger than an angel eater

The smoke clears and out emerges a figure.

P: FATHER?!

L: Angel eater where are you when I need you?

2)- Resume Peorth Living room scene

Peorth: Hmmm this angel eater is tricky business.

The loud pattering of feat is heard and Peorth is spun around quickly. 
All she can see is a swirl of blue hair.

wig?!

Father: It&#39;s the only way I could get pass that stupid robot guarding

P: Um...Father I already know all about &#39;that&#39;

Father:What you do? PEORTH how could you do such a thing without me?!

P: WHAT?? WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT WITH YOU??

Father: How could you open up a joint bank account without me knowing? I 
have plenty of experience when it comes to bank accounts and interest 
rates

Peorth sweat drops again.

P: oh that heh...We haven&#39;t opened up a joint bank account yet.

Father: Excellent let me talk you through it

3)- Green room

In the corner Mara is crying softly

Urd: Mara what are you doing here?

Mara:Why I&#39;m crying of course! LEave me alone! I havent even made an
