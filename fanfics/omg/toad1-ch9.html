<h2>Hearts on the Line.</h2>
<p>There was definitely something different.<p>
  Ranma couldn’t put his finger on it, but there was  something different.<p>
  Oh, Akane still got mad at him, still called him a baka  when he did something dumb; still walked in on him nude in the bath… She was  still the Akane he knew…<p>
  But different.<p>
  He had watched her for the four days to the match,  trying to figure out what exactly was different. Bit by bit, it came to him.<p>
  She was acting more like Zhu Shu.<p>
  He couldn’t deny it by the fourth day. She was still  getting angry with him when he said something badly, but she’d been much calmer  and more controlled about it.  And when  she had walked in on him, she had been more… deliberate.  And in other subtle ways, she had been…  affectionate.  A small hand touch here,  brushing back his bangs there.  And she  had lost the faint awkwardness of her movements, the feeling that she was  bludgeoning her way through invisible walls, and all traces of tomboyishness  from her form, if not from her attitude. True, she had seemed a trifle  preoccupied and distracted, and claimed that she was feeling kind of out of  touch with everything, but she moved with the same liquid, thoughtless grace  that made Zhu Shu so mesmerizing. He found himself being fascinated with just  watching her walk.<p>
  He finally had to admit, if only to himself, that she  was… cute.<p>
  No, he corrected himself, she went way past cute…  gorgeous wasn’t even close… she was, quite simply…<p>
  …Beautiful.<p>
  As they entered the main hallway of St. Hebereke’s  School for Girls, he had to tear his eyes away from the sway of her hips… the  lithe way she…<p>
  Fortunately, Kodachi interrupted his wandering  thoughts.<p>
  “Well… I see the clumsy cow has arrived. Are you ready  to free my Ranma from your vile clutches?”<p>
  Akane’s eyes narrowed.   “No.  I’m here to use you as a  floor mop.”<p>
  Kodachi laughed in a stilted manner and gazed over  Akane’s shoulder to Zhu Shu and a currently female, due to a small accident  with a little old lady with a water scoop, Ranma.  “And these two?”<p>
  “My coach and my second.”  Akane growled.  Ranma could see that Kodachi was already  making Akane seethe.<p>
  “Ah.”  Kodachi  started to dismiss them, then she took a closer look at Ranma.  “You! The pigtailed girl!  So… we meet again.”  She smiled viciously.  “I still owe you for the other day.  Perhaps I’ll cripple <em>her</em> so I can show <em>you</em> a  proper thanks.”<p>
  “Anytime.”   Ranma replied.<p>
  Kodachi laughed at the ice in her voice.  “I suppose we should be sporting.”  She stuck out her hand.  “May the best girl win!”<p>
  Akane started to reach for it, then grabbed Kodachi’s  wrist and turned it to show her palm. <p>
  Kodachi feigned horror.  “Oh, how<em>ever</em> did these tacks get between my fingers?” she said unapologetically.  “Well, I must be off to my dressing room… I  am <em>so</em> looking forward to this match.”  With another dose of her maniacal laughter,  she skipped away.<p>
  “She has a very black aura.”  Zhu Shu murmured, her voice soft and still  accent free.<p>
  Akane nodded.<p>
  “That’s the color of sickness… the color of  despair.  She’s not as confident as she  acts.”<p>
  Akane turned to raise a quizzical eyebrow.<p>
  “And she’s not quite sane.”  Zhu Shu added.<p>
  Akane harumphed.   “I don’t know about her sanity, but she’s definitely twisted.”  She hefted her bag and began walking towards  their dressing room.  “But what I don’t  understand is why you are spending so much energy showing me peoples auras.”  She waved a vague hand.  “I mean, you’ve been glowing for days.  Isn’t it tiring?”<p>
  Ranma raised an eyebrow.<p>
  “I’m not, Akane-chan.” Zhu Shu protested.  “Somehow, you’ve gained <em>my</em> ability to see auras.”<p>
  Akane stopped.  “What?”<p>
  “<em>You’re</em> seeing auras.  You have been ever since  we blended chi.”<p>
  “Say what!”   Ranma blurted in shock.<p>
  Zhu Shu turned to Ranma.  “When I was teaching her the Dance, something  got out of control. I don’t know how, but we blended chi… entirely.”<p>
  “Th- that’s not supposed to happen, except… except…”  the redhead blanched as he looked at them.   “…to lovers.” he finished in a whisper.   He closed his eyes as it felt like something inside of him was dying and  taking him with it.  He sighed.  “Oh, well. I suppose it was inevitable.”<p>
  He wasn’t looking at them, or he might have seen the  pain his words caused in Zhu Shu’s eyes… or the sheer rage that burned in Akane’s.  Then he was picked up and bodily slammed six  inches into the wall and had to meet Akane’s infuriated gaze.<p>
  “Ranma Saotome.   You… you… BAKA!!!  I’ll have you  know nothing of the sort happened!”  The  fire in her eyes was hotter than Ranma had ever seen.  “I don’t care how little you think of me-”  she snarled, “but I will not stand here and let you insult Zhu Shu’s honor that  way!”<p>
  Ranma tried to say something, but Akane slammed him  back into the wall.  “I <em>asked</em>. I even tried <em>seducing</em> her!  But she wouldn’t.  She thought she would betray <em>you</em> if she did, and she realized <em>I</em> was angry and jealous ... over <em>you!</em>”   She turned and threw Ranma against the opposite wall.  “And you accuse <em>her</em>!?!  If I weren’t engaged  to you, Ranma… I <em>would</em> go to her”  She stood over the smaller girl, who had slumped  to the floor and was  staring in shock at  her.  “But I told you something the other  night, and I told you not to forget it!   But I can see you can’t even do that!”<p>
  Ranma met her eyes and whispered, “You said you love <em>me…</em>”<p>
  Akane’s hands opened and closed in fury as she started  to say something several times, then finally just screamed “MEN!” and stormed  into her dressing room, leaving a speechless Ranma behind looking at Zhu Shu’s  tapping foot.  Down the hallway on either  side, small crowds of girls looked on excitedly.<p>
  Ranma looked at Zhu Shu’s tapping foot.  “I- I suppose that could have gone better.”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s foot continued it’s slow deliberate tapping.<p>
  “You’re mad at me too, aren’t you?”<p>
  The tap continued for a few more beats, then  stopped.  “Do you really think so little  of me?”<p>
  Ranma closed his eyes at the ice in her voice.  “No… I think the world of you Zhu Shu.”<p>
  “But you casually assumed that I seduced your fiancée  behind your back?”<p>
  Ranma curled his knees up against his chest as he sat  against the wall.  “What was I supposed  to think?   I mean-“<p>
  “You were jealous.”<p>
  Ranma shrugged.   “So what.  It’s obvious she wants  you more than me anyway.”<p>
  “Not true.  I  told you the other night on the roof when Kodachi nearly kissed you that Akane  was only mad because she got jealous.   She started thinking why would you want <em>her</em> when Kodachi was rich and pretty and sexy and not clumsy.  Things she felt because of the way you  treated her in the dojo while she was trying to train, and the way you call her  sexless, and a tomboy.  I know your first  impulse in a stress situation is to lash out, but because you do that, you made  Akane feel like you didn’t want her.  And  why <em>would </em>you want <em>her</em> when there was Kodachi?”<p>
  “But I don’t want Kodachi.  I- I wanted Akane.”<p>
  “But have you ever said so to Akane?  No.   Even the next morning when Kodachi was chasing you, You used Akane as an <em>excuse</em>, not as the reason for why you  didn’t want to date Kodachi.  That was  not a great way to make Akane feel like you really <em>wanted</em> to be her fiancé.  Is  it any wonder she felt hurt?  Or  jealous?  With all the insults you’ve made  about her sexuality, you given her a need to feel wanted, and when she saw me  feeling sad, she thought she could cheer me up, and maybe feel like <em>someone</em> really cared about her.  She wanted me to make love to her, to make <em>her</em> feel <em>loved</em>, and she thought sex was the way to accomplish that.  She wasn’t thinking about how badly she could  hurt anyone else, or how badly she could hurt you.  She wasn’t thinking about how it could  destroy our friendship, because <em>I</em> wouldn’t have been able to let her go if I had allowed her to go so far.  I <em>love</em> her, Ranma, and the <em>only </em>reason I  stopped her is because you’re my friend and she’s <em>your</em> fiancée.”  She made the  sullen girl look into her eyes.  “If she  were free, I would give up my family, my honor, everything I am, just to be her  love.  If I could have her by my side  forever… but I will not betray a friend!   Akane knows this.  There wasn’t  anything you could have said to have hurt her more…”<p>
  Ranma looked away, not saying anything for a long  moment.  “Why didn’t you tell me?” he  asked finally.<p>
  “Because <em>nothing</em> happened.  Ranma, she just wanted to feel  loved.  In so many ways she was just as  confused about how she felt as you are, but she needed some sign that someone  cared, that the doubts and fears she had weren’t real.  And even though I refused her, I gave her the  sign she needed.  She wasn’t trying to  hurt you.”<p>
  Ranma put his head between his hands.  “That doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt!”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed and knelt down in front of the  red-head.  “No, it doesn’t.  Anymore than it doesn’t hurt me that I had to  say no.  Ranma… know the fact that she  even <em>tried</em> hurts, but look at it from <em>her</em> side too, please.  You can’t even bring yourself to ask her on a  date, even though you said you were going to.   She’s felt you flash hot and cold, between resenting her because she’s  your fiancée, and actually caring about the fact that she’s your fiancée.  She’s spent years trying to hide the pain she’s  felt from losing her mother, to keep everyone at arms length and not let them  get close enough to cause her that kind of pain again, but you <em>got</em> in… and that’s what scared her so  badly.  The fear of losing <em>you</em> made her a little crazy.”<p>
  “But you heard her!   The only reason she’s with me is because of this stupid fiancée thing  our dads arranged!”<p>
  Zhu Shu reached out and lifted the red-head’s  tear-streaked face and made her meet her gaze.   “If you truly take those words at face value, Ranma, you are a bigger  fool than Kuno.”   <p>
  Ranma sniffed and turned away.  “I don’t know what to think, Zhu Shu.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Then let me ask one last thing.   Do you love her?”<p>
  Ranma’s blue eyes locked on the floor.  “I- I don’t know.”<p>
  “Then why are you crying?  She’s handed you the keys to her heart, given  you her soul for safe keeping.  Which is  more important, Ranma?  Your pride... or  Akane?  She might have started out doing  this for the gymnastics team, but her reason for allowing me to teach her the  Dance was for you, Ranma. She went through all of this for <em>your</em> sake.  Will you deprive  her of the only thing she seeks to win?”<p>
  Ranma pushed himself upright.  “I- I… Tell Akane I’m sorry.  I’ve got to go think.”<p>
  Zhu Shu closed her eyes.  “Very well.   Just… before you do anything, please, if you still trust anything I say,  then believe that Akane loves <em>you</em>.”<p>
  There was the sound of Ranma’s footsteps walking away…  then getting faster and faster until he was running.    An explosion of conversation started up at  the end of the hall, but Zhu Shu ignored it.   She stood and looked after the departed red-head, trying to quell the  storm of emotions  roiling in her breast.  For a long moment she stood and watched the  entrance before wiping her eyes and turning to the dressing room. <p>
  <em>Ranma, you really are a baka…</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane stood by the window, staring blankly while idly  playing with her braid and humming a sing song tune.  At her feet lay a bouquet of black roses  surrounded by a faint haze of white powder.<p>
  Zhu Shu stopped at seeing her.  “Akane?”<p>
  Akane giggled.  “Zhu-sa-ma-I-was-thin-king-of-you.”  she sing-songed as she turned and moved towards the other girl, snagging her  foot on her bag and tripping.  She did a  handstand and flipped, her legs catching Zhu Shu on either shoulder as she bore  her over and down.  Akane landed sitting  on Zhu Shu’s chest and looked around.  “Zhu-sa-ma,  where-are-you?”<p>
  She lifted her skirt at the muffled reply and looked  down at the Chinese girl’s face between her legs, giggling again.  “Silly Zhu Shu.  You’re not supposed to be there.  Ranma is!” She raised a finger to tap her  cheek thoughtfully. “Except I’m mad at him!”   She giggled madly, nearly tumbling over.<p>
  “Are you ok?” Zhu Shu asked, worried.<p>
  “I’m <em>Fiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnneeeeee</em>…”  Akane giggled again and reached down to pull her panties aside to reveal her  bare pubic area.  “See!  I shaved so I’d be just like you.  Just for Ranma.”  She placed a finger on Zhu Shu’s nose.  “And then he had to make me mad at him.”  She trailed her finger down Zhu Shu’s face  and up her pubis.  “So… none for him!”  She let her panties go with a snap as she  giggled and this time did fall over.<p>
  Zhu Shu untangled herself from Akane’s legs and rose  to her knees.  She examined the madly  giggling girl and looked around to see the roses.  She dusted her finger and looked at it.  “Poppy.” she muttered disgustedly.  “With several other ingredients I suspect.”<p>
  She sat the still giggling girl up.  Akane looked at her and smiled. “Zhu-sa-ma!  You were between my legs!  Naughty girl!”  Zhu Shu grimaced.<p>
  “Definitely more than just poppy.”  She reached behind her back and pulled out  her herb case, opening it to withdraw a small vial.  “It’s not a real antidote, but the effects  will offset the worst of this.  But there  are going to be some side effects, especially with what you’re already on.” she  said as she looked at Akane.  “It will  make you capable of fighting, but…” she noted the wide eyed look Akane was  giving the bottle.  “Well… I suppose it  really couldn’t make you <em>less</em> inhibited.”<p>
  Akane snatched the vial out of Zhu Shu’s hand.  “Sake!”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked on in astonishment as she drained the  vial.  She blinked a few times and stole  a quote from Kasumi. “Oh, my.  You weren’t  supposed to drink the whole bottle!”<p>
  Akane sat with her head tilted and blinked a few times  as her pupils un-dilated, then looked around the room as if she’d never seen it  before.  Her gaze came to rest on Zhu Shu  and strange look came to her eyes.  She  stretched, cat-like, then stalked over to the Chinese girl on all fours and  meowed.  Then she batted the confused  girl over and crawled up her until they were nose to nose.<p>
  “Akane?” Zhu Shu asked nervously, staring at the  purring girl in shock.<p>
  “You. Are. Purrrrrrrrr-fectly. Sexy.” Akane said as  she nuzzled Zhu Shu’s face, then her eyes fell upon her bag and the black roses  laying by it and her eyes lit up.  “Oh!  Playtime!”   She giggled and leaped upwards.<p>
  Zhu Shu caught only a glimpse of the blur that hit the  door as a rain of Akane’s clothes began to fall…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma wandered along a canal, and kicked a rock  despondently.  What was he to do?<p>
  Akane said she loved him… but she had asked Zhu Shu to  sleep with her!  And somehow… they had  merged chi.  He believed Zhu Shu that  they hadn’t done anything, but still… the merger had to show that the desire  had been there even if the actions had not, right?<p>
  He sat on the edge of a bridge and stared into the  water.  What was he going to do?<p>
  “You look troubled, young lady.  May I possibly be of some assistance?”<p>
  Ranma started at the quiet and kindly voice and turned  to see a woman giving her a friendly smile.   She was fairly tall, and an obvious foreigner, with long grey hair and  pale skin.  She was very pretty, the  tattoos on her cheeks and forehead seeming to add to her beauty.  She was dressed like a college student, and a  book bag with the words Nikomi Tech hung from her shoulder.  Something about her smile made him feel like  the world was suddenly a much better place to be.  Shyly, he smiled back.  <p>
  “I’m okay, I guess.   Just trying to think things out.”<p>
  “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.  Would you like to talk?  Sometimes, all you need is a different  viewpoint.”<p>
  Ranma shrugged, somehow instinctively knowing he could  trust the other girl.  “I guess.  I mean, if you really want to hear about the  mess I call my life.”<p>
  “Surely it can’t be so bad as that?  Would you like to go over to that ice-cream  parlor?  My treat.” <p>
  Ranma smiled.  “I  never turn down ice cream.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu caught up to Akane at the ring, where she  prowled like a playful tigress.  She had  changed into the black and orange striped tights she’d brought somewhere during  her blur and twin ribbons lashed behind her like tails.  Then she caught sight of Zhu Shu and waved  before bouncing over to plant a kiss on her nose before giggling and bouncing  into the ring again. Zhu Shu sighed.  She  was still as high as a kite… but at least the lethargy the poppy would have  induced seemed to have been fully countered.<p>
  A commotion arose at the door as they opened and the  audience started to filter in, along with Genma and the other two Tendo  girls.  They took seats at the front, the  audience choosing not to argue with a giant panda.  Kasumi looked at Akane and asked, “Is she ok?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “She had a really bad fight  with Ranma, then Kodachi hit her with some kind of weird drug that started to  put her to sleep.  I tried to give her  something to keep her awake, and she took far more than I intended.  Now, I am not really sure what she is going  to do.”<p>
  “Oh, my.” Kasumi looked worried.<p>
  Akane meanwhile had lashed her ribbons to the overhead  beams and was using them as a swing.  She  swung back and forth in lazy arcs, staring off into space dreamily.  The crowd buzzed with whispers as the seats  filled with students from both schools commenting on her odd behavior.<p>
  Finally Kodachi entered, a small frown crossing her  face when she saw Akane had made it to the ring.  She greeted Kuno as she proceeded to the ring  where she threw off her robe to reveal a skintight black leotard with a  stylized rose design in charcoal grey.   She stepped into the ring, a black rose between her teeth.  Akane looked at her curiously and dropped to  the mat, ribbons once again lashing like a cat’s tail.<p>
  The Referee looked at her nervously before proceeding  with her opening. “And now the Champions of the Schools!  In this corner… From St. Hebereke’s School  for Girls… <em>Kodachiiiiii  Kuuuuuuuunnnnoooo!”</em><p>
  Kodachi waved to the cheering crowd and threw her rose  into the audience. The announcer turned to Akane.  “And in this corner… umm… what’s your name?”  she finished in a stage whisper.<p>
  Akane stared at Kodachi intently as she murmured her  name.<p>
  The Referee stepped back and continued.  “And representing Furinkan High… <em>Akaneeee Tennnndoooo!”</em><p>
  The Furinkan students broke into cheers as Kuno threw  roses at the stage.<p>
  “Champions to the center!”  The Announcer called. Akane looked at Kodachi  with her head tilted to one side as she tucked her ribbons behind her back. <p>
  Zhu Shu blinked. <em>Wha-?  I didn’t teach her that!</em><p>
  The two girls approached each other and the Referee  made them shake hands.  Kodachi had to  get another dig in.  “Well cow, are you  ready to lose your claim to <em>my</em> Ranma?”<p>
  Akane gave her a curious look.  “Over <em>your</em> dead body.”  She tilted her head the  other way and reached out and snagged Kodachi’s leotard by the V between her  breasts and pulled her close.  “Or maybe  not, cute and psychotic.”<p>
  Kodachi sprang back as Akane turned and giggled all  the way back to her corner her hips swaying provocatively. Kodachi stared at  her retreating form. “Y-y-you dare!” <p>
  “You betcha!” Akane answered, pulling down one eyelid  as she stuck out her tongue. Then she leaned over the ropes and whispered  conspiratorially at Zhu Shu. “I don’t know why’d she want <em>him</em> though. He’s a bitch! Thinks nothing of ripping out hearts.  Maybe I <em>should</em> let her have him.” She  looked at the stricken Chinese girl and winked. “Or maybe <em>I’ll</em> go to her. I’m already a slut, right! He said so! Wanna bet I  can get her out of that outfit before the end of the fight?” She giggled and  leered at Zhu Shu. “Hot girl-girl action, doncha know.”<p>
  “Akane, please! Don’t be like that.” Zhu Shu pleaded. “You  aren’t yourself right now! It’s what Kodachi drugged you with!”<p>
  “I can’t hear <em>yooou</em>!”  Akane sang as she rolled to look at Zhu Shu upside down. “My head is full of  fluff and my ears are ringing!”<p>
  “That’s the bell! Look out!”<p>
  “Whups!” Akane giggled as she dodged Kodachi’s club  attack. She flipped to the top of a corner pole and shook her finger. “Naughty,  naughty! Attacking while I’m talking about Ranma. Bad girl! Mommy spank!” She  jumped over another blow.<p>
  Kodachi steamed. “How dare you mock the Black Rose!” she  screamed as she launched the club straight at Akane’s head.<p>
  At the top of her leap, Akane’s ribbons reappeared and  intercepted the club, knocking it flying before they quested downwards after  Kodachi.<p>
  Kodachi laughed and knocked them away with her rope,  the cord standing as stiffly as a sword.<p>
  “Just what we’ve come to expect from the Flower of  Martial Gymnastics, Kodachi Kuno! She handles the rope as if it’s a rod!” the  Announcer called.<p>
  Akane landed while dodging another blow, inadvertently  stepping on Kodachi’s discarded club and stumbling. Kodachi took advantage of  her misstep to clobber her with her stiff rope, revealing it wasn’t a rope at  all.<p>
  “Wait a minute, the Announcer cried. “It is a rod!! A  rod disguised as a rope!”<p>
  “Akane!” Zhu Shu screamed as Akane reeled away from  Kodachi, dazed by the blow. She yelled at the Referee “Kodachi’s cheating!”<p>
  The Referee looked at her and shrugged. “So long as it’s  not a bare handed blow.”<p>
  Kodachi laughed and twirled her clubs, then jabbed at  Akane, who just barely dodged as she was recovering. Then she dived against the  ropes as with a pong, spikes sprang from the club and clipped her ear.<p>
  “She’s using spiked clubs!” Zhu Shu yelled at the  Referee. <p>
  The Referee turned to look, but as she did, the spikes  snapped back into the club. “I don’t see any spikes.” she called back.<p>
  “I do all this so that I may date Ranma!” Kodachi  cried to the crowd. “Oh how inspiring the lengths to which I’ll go!!”<p>
  Akane had regained her balance and giggled. “Dream on  cutie!” she cried as a ribbon shot out to snare Kodachi and drag the girl into  the ring. “She’s <em>mine</em>! Lock, stock  and cute little curly red pubic hairs!” She pulled her ribbon and sent Kodachi  spinning like a top to careen into the ropes.<p>
  “An ingenious attack from the crazy girl from Furinkan  High!” <p>
  Kodachi meanwhile had spun into the corner and caught  her leotard top on the turnbuckle.  As  she straightened there was a loud rip, and Kodachi’s entire left sleeve tore  free. <p>
  Kodachi looked down at her torn leotard and screamed. “You  wretched girl! Look what you have done!” She grabbed her clubs and swung repeatedly  as Akane jumped and dodged. <p>
  As Akane jumped over her, a pair of ribbons wrapped  around Kodachi’s waist and spun her to face the mischievously smiling girl. “Now,  now. Temper will get you no-where with me.   But for being really <em>cute</em> when  you’re angry…” she leaned forward and the entire crowd ceased all noise as she  kissed Kodachi on the lips.<p>
  Kodachi stumbled backwards as sounds of disbelief, and  the occasional cheer, echoed through the crowd.<p>
  “This match has… has taken a truly unexpected turn!!  Can a <em>kiss</em> be considered a bare  handed blow? It certainly has set our Champion reeling!”<p>
  The judges consulted in a flurry of voices before  their flags came up. “Valid! No hands or feet involved!”<p>
  Kodachi wiped the back of her hand across her lips, a  lost look in her eyes, then Akane giggled again and Kodachi’s eyes flared. “So!  Now you would toy with my Heart! Such insult cannot be allowed! You dreadful  girl!” <p>
  She launched a furious assault on Akane, but Akane’s  ribbons kept intercepting them.  Akane  skipped backwards as she sing-songed “Dachi and Akane sitting in a tree-whups!”  The rings ropes blocked her as Kodachi grabbed a hoop from her second and  screamed “I shall punish you!”<p>
  The ring flew at Akane’s throat, but she dodged the  hoop, the ring continuing until it sliced through the top of the corner pole  she’d been next to. She stared at the cleanly sliced pole and mumbled “Whoa… Burma shave.”  as Kodachi’s ribbon reached out to snag the hoop and draw it towards Akane’s  back.<p>
  “Watch out!” Kasumi and Zhu Shu screamed in unison as  the crowd drew a breath in horror.<p>
  Akane sensed the ring at the last second,  and did a mid-air cartwheel as she flipped to  balance on the rope on one foot.<p>
  Nabiki blinked. “Since when is she <em>that</em> good?”<p>
  Kodachi angled her hoop at Akane again. Akane frowned  and lashed out with her ribbons. Gold fire flickered along their length as they  slashed Kodachi’s hoop into pieces.<p>
  “And Akane razors Kodachi’s hoop!” The Announcer  screamed as Zhu Shu did a double-blink. That definitely wasn’t part of <em>Shiva’s</em> Dance. <p>
  Akane giggled. “That’s not playing nice! I’ll teach  you to play with sharp things!” She giggled again as her ribbon blurred into a  flicker of golden light that played around Kodachi’s waist and spun the girl  around. She staggered after she stopped spinning and small wisps of thread fell  from the halter top and g-string Akane had left of her leotard. Shreds of black  cloth littered the ring, and only her right sleeve remained intact. Murmurs of  appreciation arose from the male students in the crowd at the sight of how  little Akane had left of Kodachi’s outfit. Akane sat down and bounced on the  ropes as Kodachi took stock and catcalled “Now play nice or I’ll take the rest.”<p>
  Kodachi’s fists clenched as she howled “You BITCH!”  She grabbed her clubs. “I will pay you back for this a hundred fold! Now!  Witness the secret technique of the Black Rose! The Blow of a Thousand Hands at  full frenzy!”<p>
  Akane laughed as she dodged the massive volley of  blows. Air pressure from the misses shattered the first two rows of bleachers  and sent spectators flying. Screams of panic went up from the crowd.<p>
  “My God!” yelled the Announcer. “It looks like she’s  using twenty clubs! There’s no doubt about it! The madwoman from Furinkan has  definitely raised Kodachi’s ire as well as her hemlines!”<p>
  Akane’s ribbons reached down to grab a ball from the  sidelines, and she leaped high, her ribbons forming a tight spiral as she  launched it like a bullet down at Kodachi’s still futile attempts to hit her.  The ball smashed down through the volley of clubs and exploded loudly against  the mat as clubs rained down around Kodachi.<p>
  “And the truth is revealed!” The Announcer called,  still clutching her mike amid the wreckage Kodachi had made of her table. “She <em>was</em> using twenty clubs!”<p>
  Kodachi looked down in disbelief at the clubs  surrounding her, then over to where Akane was casually strolling along the rope  singing a nursery rhyme. Her eyes hardened. “This is only the beginning!” she  cried as she pulled her ribbons from somewhere. “The true essence of Martial  Gymnastics is control of an endless array of weapons!” The ribbon reached out  to snag a bell from the wreckage around the ring and she hurled it at Akane.<p>
  Akane intercepted the bell with her ribbons and it  fell to the mat in four pieces as she laughed. “Oho! Trying to ring my bell and  we haven’t even been on a first date!” Her ribbon slithered around in a spiral  to smack Kodachi on the rear with a loud crack. Kodachi jumped and a blush  spread across her cheeks at the yelp she had let out. Akane stood on a corner  pole and looked at her with her head cocked. “Whaddaya ya know, I think she <em>liked</em> that!”<p>
  Kodachi eeped and grabbed a chair to throw at Akane,  but as she turned, she found Akane right in front of her. The chair clattered  to the floor as her momentum carried her against the other girl and she stared  into the strange expression in Akane’s eyes. Only she heard the words Akane  spoke. “Yep. You need a good fucking.” But the tone made her stagger backwards  a half dozen steps in shock.<p>
  She stared at Akane as her heart hammered. Akane stood  there like a hyper-eager airline hostess. Her feet were together and her hands  were behind her back as she leaned slightly forward while her ribbons danced  behind her back like tails. On her face was a friendly smile…<p>
  Wind whistled through the silent auditorium.<p>
  Like a trapped animal, Kodachi looked around wildly,  finally spying her brother looking at her coldly. In almost terror, she snagged  him and hurled him at Akane.<p>
  Whatever spell had existed for that frozen moment  broke as Kuno yelled and swung his bokken. Akane moved aside and used her  ribbons to hurl Kuno into the crowd.<p>
  “Use of brother valid!” The judges called as Kodachi  began to hurl everything she could at Akane.<p>
  “It’s a battle for the ages!” the Announcer called. “The  Black Rose is in rare form today, but her opponent isn’t giving an inch! What  will happen next! And all our male fans are wondering, I’m sure, will Kodachi  lose any more of her outfit? It’s still anyone’s match!”<p>
  Zhu Shu was still watching slack jawed when the panda,  seemingly uninterested in the match, tapped her on the shoulder and offered her  a cup of tea.<p>
  “Mister Saotome! This is no time to be relaxing! Akane’s  higher than a kite! She could be killed!”<p>
  The panda gave the ring an eye, then shrugged  unconcernedly as he sat down with his kettle and tea cup.<p>
  Kodachi was still desperately attacking an Akane who  seemed to be having more and more fun blocking her attacks and snipping more of  Kodachi’s outfit. The right sleeve was now gone and only a thin band covered  her breasts. She’d also lost the right side of her bottom and only a single  strand kept the cloth covering between her legs. She was despairing because  Akane still only seemed to be half paying attention and hadn’t stopped giggling.  As the rebuff to one last attack severed the cloth between her breasts, her  eyes fell on the kettle next to the panda. Heedless of the loss of her top and  the whistles of appreciation from the crowd, she snagged the kettle and held it  triumphantly.<p>
  “Hah! Even a cockroach will surrender in the face of  the Attack of the Boiling Water!” She leaped to pour steaming water on Akane  but was unsuccessful.<p>
  “And Akane retreats!” the Announcer yelled. “But then  that water does look hot!”<p>
  Akane leaped high to avoid the splashes, but Kodachi  anticipated her. As she descended, the kettle was slashed apart right in front  of her and as a cloud of steam covered her a nonsense yell came from her mouth.<p>
  Nonsense to everyone but Zhu Shu. It was Mandarin  Chinese for Dragon’s Egg Shield. The same technique she used to shield herself.  But that would mean Akane was using the Song School of Sword Dance’s secret  techniques…<p>
  A golden globe of light dropped from the bottom of the  cloud of steam, revealing a completely dry and unharmed Akane. She dropped into  a perfect stance atop a corner pole as the globe faded, her ribbon wands  reversed in her hands as she held them like paired swords, the ribbons around  her lashing like angry serpents. “That was mean!” Akane called as her ribbons  flashed out to wrap the nearly nude Kodachi and hurl her through the air, the  last piece of her leotard fluttering to the mat.<p>
  “Is this it.” The Announcer called. “Has Akane  stripped Kodachi of not only her clothing, but victory as well?”<p>
  A shrill whistle came from the airborne Kodachi and  the ring shuddered into motion towards her.   It crossed the wreckage to intercept her and as she landed smugly, she  struck a pose and cried “Out is an impossibility for me!” She laughed  maniacally. “And the loss of my clothes means nothing! I shall prevail! I shall  win my Ranma from you! I refuse to be beaten by a perverted girl like you!”<p>
  Akane looked at Kodachi’s dramatic pose and giggled. “Ya  know, you’re especially cute when you’re <em>naked</em> and angry.” Her ribbon lashed across Kodachi’s nipples, electing a gasp of  involuntary pleasure from the girl. “But Ran-ma sa-ma is mi-ine! No-ot  your-ors!” She frowned. “Even if he does think his best friend slept with me!”  she added sullenly.<p>
  A shocked hush crossed the auditorium. In the silence  a shocked “Oh, my!” came from Kasumi, and the thud of Nabiki’s soda hitting the  floor was like a rock fall.<p>
  Akane’s eyes hardened as she looked at the still  stunned Kodachi. “And you! <em>It’s all your  fault!</em> If <em>you</em> hadn’t tried to <em>kiss</em> him!” Her ribbon lashed across  Kodachi’s nipples again and made her arch her back. “Then you tried to steal  him!” The ribbon lashed between Kodachi’s legs. “Then you had to come to my  school-” flick “and attack me!” flick “Then chase him!” Akane’s blows came more  and more frequently and Kodachi’s eyes were glazing. “And then you had to be  Kuno’s sister! And cute! And rich!” with every exclamation, Akane’s ribbon  struck again. Kodachi stood frozen, her ribbon falling from nerveless fingers  as her breath came in short gasps. <p>
  “Then you had the nerve-“ Akane yelled, raw fury in  her eyes now. “To try and take him from ME! Take that! And that! And that! And  that!” Akane punctuated each statement with another blow. “WHY! CAN’T! YOU! UNDER!  STAND! THAT! <em>I!</em> <em>LOVE! HIM!</em>”<p>
  As the last blow landed between her legs, Kodachi  could take no more. She screamed as her body convulsed in a massive orgasm and  she fell to her knees. Adoring eyes fell on Akane’s tear streaked face and she  whispered “I’m sorry, Mistress…”<p>
  Then she fainted.<p>
  Akane collapsed to her knees in tears as the shaky  Referee stepped up to her and raised Akane’s hand. “And the winner is…” The  Announcer spoke in a quiet voice. “Is Akane Tendo.”<p>
  Zhu Shu rushed forward to shelter Akane as the crowd  erupted in wild cheers…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“So ya see, I don’t know what to think!” Ranma said as  he finished the last of his ice cream and sighed.  He couldn’t believe he had poured all of this  out on this nice girl,  Belldandy, but  somehow, it really had made him feel better to have it all off his chest.<p>
  Belldandy had been daintily nibbling at her ice cream  as the red-head had told her about  his  problems, listening and commenting only as needed to help Ranma carry on, but  as he finished she laid down her spoon and pushed her remaining ice cream over  to the distraught girl.  She had come by  to check on how her spell had been working, but had decided upon seeing Ranma  that the poor boy needed a shoulder to cry on… so to speak.  After hearing about the fight he had just  had, she felt a least partially responsible for Ranma’s despair, since it had  been <em>her</em> spell that blended Akane’s  chi and psyche with Zhu Shu.  It was  seeming to have the desired result in Akane, but some of the things Keiichi had  said combined with Ranma’s story made her a little worried about the Chinese  girl.  She was going to have to look into  that, but first, she felt compelled to help Ranma.<p>
  “I do hope you won’t think this is intrusive of me,  but <em>everyone</em> makes mistakes.  I think that this Akane must <em>really</em> love you to be so affected by  what you say.”<p>
  Ranma looked up from the new bowl.  “Ya really think so?  So why’d she want to sleep with Zhu-chan?”<p>
  “Well… humans have a very deep need to feel loved and  to love.  It’s one of the most wonderful  things about them.  But those needs  sometimes can cause people to do things in a kind of desperation.  When they have too much of a need to feel  love, they may try to find it wherever they can.  They may not even realize that it’s what they’re  looking for, but sometimes the need is so great that no price seems too great,  no action too extreme.”<p>
  Ranma looked at her curiously.  “Really?   I mean I’ve seen stuff like that on TV and stuff, but real life ain’t  like that.”<p>
  Belldandy smile.   “Whether you believe it or not, it is.   Humans will do anything for love.   Beyond hope, beyond fate, beyond even survival, love is the motivator  that will make a man or woman overcome any hardship, any danger.  Love has changed the fate of the world more  times than anyone will ever know, Ranma.   It has changed the course of more worlds than you could ever even  conceive.  You never know, in some  worlds, perhaps even <em>you</em> have dared  to challenge the gods for love.”<p>
  Ranma chuckled.   “You really believe in love, huh?”<p>
  Belldandy smiled.   “Absolutely.  My Keiichi is the  most wonderful person in the world, and I’d do anything for him, and I think he’d  do anything for me.  But love’s course  isn’t always smooth.  We’ve had many  trials and setbacks, but love makes it all worthwhile, and allows us to forgive  the mistakes we make and concentrate on the successes.”<p>
  “So maybe I’m overreacting, huh?”  Ranma licked the spoon thoughtfully.<p>
  Belldandy gave him a gentle smile.  “That’s for <em>you</em> to decide.  To err is  human, after all.  How many times have  you forgiven your father for what he’s done?   Has Akane truly done anything worse? Didn’t you admit that Miss Zhu Shu  is desirable, that had you not been separated you might have even fallen in  love with her yourself?  With her being  such a good friend to you both, can you truly blame your Akane for turning to  her in a time of need?”<p>
  Ranma put down the spoon in the empty bowl as he put  his head on his hand.   His long red  braid fell over his shoulder and he caught it and played with it as he said, “Love  conquers all and all that, huh.”  He  looked at his hair and recalled why he had grown it out.  “I just wish I really knew if <em>I </em>loved her.”<p>
  Belldandy smiled.   “Your heart will tell you… every day.   You just have to learn how to interpret it.”<p>
  Ranma looked at his hair and blinked, then looked down  at himself.  “Oh man, I forgot.  You must be kinda freaked out hearing a girl  go on like this about another girl.”<p>
  “Hearts don’t have genders, Ranma.  And love knows no boundaries.  It doesn’t matter <em>who</em> the one you love is, or <em>how  many</em> loved ones you have, so long as you <em>truly</em> love them.  “<p>
  Ranma looked at her, a thoughtful expression on his  face.  “Well, thank you.  You’ve been really kind and you’ve really  given me a lot to think about; maybe even a solution.”<p>
  “Think nothing of it, Ranma.  Helping is what I do.”<p>
  He rose and held out his hand to help Belldandy to her  feet.  “I hope I see you again sometime.”<p>
  Belldandy’s eyes sparkled.  “Maybe.”<p>
  Ranma gave her a smile.  “I gotta get back to the dojo.  I think maybe I owe Akane a real apology… for  more than just today.”<p>
  “Best wishes.” Belldandy said as Ranma turned to go.<p>
  Ranma gave her a smile from the ice cream parlor’s  door.  “Somehow, when you say that, I  believe it just might come true.”      <p>
  Belldandy watched him walk down the street with a  smile.  It always felt good to help.  As the red-head jumped to a rooftop, she  reached out to the mirror beside the table, and in a sparkle of light, she was  gone.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The nurse looked over Akane and sighed. “She’ll be ok,  but damned if I’ve ever seen this combination before. Kodachi’s potions usually  result in sleep, paralysis, or some other type of incapacitation in one way or  another. I’d suspect she was on some kind of speed, but that’s not something  Kodachi generally uses.”<p>
  “She took a ginseng potion to counter the sleepiness.”  Zhu Shu said, a worried look on her face.<p>
  The nurse nodded. “Strong potion that. She’s  exhausted. I’d say the potion burned the other drug out of her faster then it  would have gone normally, but it drained her in the process. She’ll likely  sleep till tomorrow. Still, it explains some of the strange behavior she was  exhibiting, but not all of it.<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed.   “It was a nuptial potion.  I was  only going to give her a small dose, but she took the whole bottle.”<p>
  “An aphrodisiac?   Well, that explains that.”  The nurse  smiled.  “She’ll probably not remember  much of anything she did.  Kind of a pity  really.  Kodachi has needed a come down  for awhile.  It’s amusing that she had a  hand in her own downfall.  Still, I’d  tell her to be careful.  Kodachi’s the  type to hold very long grudges and she was utterly humiliated…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The subject of the Nurse’s comments sat in the locker  room staring off into space. She was still nude, the marks of the lashing she  had received a bright red against her skin. The other girls of the gymnastics  team cowered around the room fearing her reaction when she finally moved. She  had never been a kind mistress, and every girl there had felt her ribbon in a  manner similar to what she had received at Akane’s hands. They all feared her.<p>
  But Kodachi had not reacted yet. She was still  contemplating the fight.<p>
  Finally, she moved. She stood and moved over to the  full length mirror and stared at herself. For almost half an hour she stood  there, the team barely daring to breathe lest they spark her wrath, yet she  never moved.<p>
  At the last, she turned and walked to her locker,  apparently not seeing the team.  She  slowly dressed, her motions almost robotic, then she turned, her eyes raising  to look at the most senior girl of the team.<p>
  “I am unable to lead you now. You must be the captain.  My destiny lies elsewhere.”<p>
  To stunned silence, she turned and vanished out the  door.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>A strange procession traipsed home from St Hebereke’s  towards the Tendo dojo.  Kasumi led, with  a depressed Zhu Shu at her side, followed by the panda carrying the unconscious  Akane.  Nabiki followed behind, carrying  Akane’s pack and listening to the conversation her sister was having with the  Chinese girl.<p>
  “So the nurse said she’d be ok?” Kasumi asked Zhu Shu  again. “That all the effects would be gone when she awoke?<p>
  “All the effects of the drugs Kodachi gave her. I’m  not sure about other things.” She gave the unconscious girl a look and  sighed.  “I’m worried about how Ranma took  off.”<p>
  “Oh, I’m sure we can work that out.” Kasumi said. “Once  he’s had a chance to think, I’ll talk to him.   I’m just glad the match is over with.   Your teaching Akane really helped.   I had no idea that you had taught her so much when you taught her the  Dance!  She could never do half the stuff  she did in the ring before. I had no idea there was so much to it.”<p>
  “There is more to it than Akane used, but not  everything she was using were techniques from the Dance.  Somehow, she absorbed the knowledge of the  Song school as well.”<p>
  Kasumi stared. “But- but how could she… I mean… she  was never that good at ki before.  If you  didn’t teach her…” Kasumi blinked in wonder.<p>
  Zhu Shu lowered her head. “I suspect we shared a lot  more than just a few memories and techniques when our chi merged.” She looked  at Akane and the heartbreak in her eyes was plain. “A <em>lot</em> more. I can’t separate out my feelings from Akane’s feelings…”<p>
  Kasumi stopped. “You shared her feelings?” She turned  to Zhu Shu, realization dawning in her eyes.<p>
  “No.” Zhu Shu said. “I <em>have</em> her feelings.”<p>
  “Oh, my. Then that must mean you-” She broke off.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “I’m in love with Ranma too.”<p>
  It was a long silent walk home.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma had arrived home just minutes prior to find  no-one home but the voodoo priest and Soun.   He had taken one look at them playing Go and gone back outside to pace.<p>
  As he wore out the ground in front of the gate, his  braid lashing like a whip at every turn, he went over and over what Belldandy  had told him, trying to think of what he was going to say to Akane.  It was so confusing how he felt.<p>
  He hadn’t wanted to be engaged to Akane, yet somehow,  he’d come to think of her as <em>his</em> fiancée.  He wasn’t really upset that she’d  asked Zhu Shu to bed, but he <em>was</em> upset at both of them for not <em>telling</em> him about it.  He’d realized that the  threat Zhu Shu had delivered the night she’d kissed Kasumi had been just a  bluff, and that Zhu Shu really <em>was</em> trying to help him with Akane, but keeping this from him had been wrong.  <p>
  Hells, he wouldn’t even have cared if Akane <em>had</em> succeeding in seducing Zhu Shu, it  wasn’t <em>that</em> big a deal, especially  with the idea he’d gotten while speaking to Belldandy, but the fact they had  hid it from him showed they didn’t trust him when it came to stuff like this,  and that really hurt, since they had trusted him in so much else.  It made it feel like he’d failed somehow, and  in a worse way than normal.<p>
  Okay, so he didn’t know much about any of that stuff,  and the thought of trying any of the things Hiroshi and Daisuke suggested  scared him silly because it sounded so ridiculous, and he was positive if he  tried any of it, Akane would pound him into the ground, but he wanted to get it  right… to… to…<p>
  <em>Gods!   At least admit it to yourself, you baka!</em>  he  thought.  <em>You </em>want<em> to be her </em>lover<em>.  You  can’t get how nice her body looks out of your mind and you dream about her  every night!  Stop being a fool and tell  her!</em><p>
  He looked down the street to see if she was coming  yet, and he felt his heart stop beating.<p>
  He only saw one face.   Akane’s.  And she looked so  lifeless.  The color drained out of his  face as the returning group drew closer.   Dread froze him in place, the blood in his veins turning to ice.  Zhu Shu was so somber…<p>
  A thousand screaming demons howled every insult he had  said to her in his ears.  A thousand  whips flayed his soul with barbs of ice.   He should have been there.  Should  have protected her.  Should have shielded  her with his body from all harm.<p>
  A hand on his arm startled him and he looked over into  Zhu Shu’s shadowed eyes.  “She’ll be all  right.  Kodachi tried to win by drugging  her.  I had to give her something to  counteract it.  She’s <em>okay</em>.   Kodachi barely laid a finger on her before Akane defeated her.  She just fainted afterwards.”<p>
  The words sounded like they were coming from a great  distance, but they broke the hold the ice had over his soul.  With a shudder, he took a breath, his knees  going weak.  “Thank the gods.”<p>
  “I don’t know when she’s going to wake up, but likely  it’ll be in the next eighteen hours.”<p>
  Ranma shook his head in relief.  “You say she won?”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  Ranma hung his head.   “I’m sorry I wasn’t there to see it.   I- I’m sorry I ran.”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s hand on his arm squeezed him  reassuringly.  “She told the whole school  today that she loves <em>you</em>.  Even Kuno could not have misunderstood.”<p>
  “Yeah… I have it on tape too.”  Nabiki said.   “I figure 10,000 yen a copy is about right.”<p>
  “I’ll - I’ll look at it later.”  He stepped in front of Genma and took Akane  into his arms.  “I’ll take her to her  room.  I want to be there when she wakes.”<p>
  Zhu Shu started to say something, then nodded her head  in agreement.  Ranma sighed<p>
  “I’m not mad at either of you for what happened… I  just wish you had trusted me enough to tell me.”<p>
  The small red head disappeared into the building,  leaving a stricken looking Zhu Shu staring after him. Kasumi put a hand on the  smaller girls shoulder.  “It’ll be all  right Zhu-chan.”<p>
  The Chinese girl shook her head.  “I’ll be okay Kasumi.  Thank you.”   She sighed heavily.  “It’s just,  ever since I picked up Akane’s emotions I feel like I’m caught in a  whirlwind.  I- I think I just want to go  and meditate.”<p>
  Kasumi noted the pleading look in Zhu Shu’s eyes and  gave her a reassuring smile.  “Of  course.  I’ll bring you dinner in the  garden.”<p>
  Zhu Shu attempted a grateful smile.  “Thank you.”<p>
  As the rest of the group re-entered the house and Zhu  Shu walked around to the koi pond, a silent form observed them from atop a  phone pole.  Cloaked in the gathering  twilight, it seemed to fade into the background as it watched the Chinese girl  sit on her favorite rock and begin a meditation trance.  A soft sigh escaped from the figure.  Zhu Shu had done well.  It looked like Ranma might finally have  realized he cared for the Tendo girl, and that boded well for the morrow.<p>
  With a last long look at the figure in the garden, Ke  Lun turned to go.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Time passed slowly… day crawling into night, night  crawling into dawn, dawn crawling into…<p>
  Akane awoke to a bright morning. She had a few faint  traces of a headache, but other than that, she felt wonderful. Still sleep  fogged, she lazed with her eyes closed and cleared her chakra and cleansed her  ki, letting it flow through her body and wipe the lethargy of sleep from her  mind.<p>
  It came to her then exactly what she was doing, and in  the calm clear state of mind she found herself in, she realized it seemed she  had <em>always</em> known how to do it, yet  she could also clearly remember never having done so before.<p>
  Curious, she searched through the rest of her mind,  astonished by what was there. A vast store of skills lay dormant in her mind,  poised on the verge of her consciousness, and as she acknowledged them, it  seemed as if a signal had been given. With an almost audible click, they  settled into her mind and body as if they were her own…<p>
  And with them came memories…<p>
  She knew they were Zhu Shu’s, but the feelings they  evoked were her own. They flowed through her consciousness and settled into  their places in her mind, bringing with them Zhu Shu’s past.<p>
  She understood now, so much that had puzzled her about  the Chinese girl and understanding nearly broke her heart. Zhu Shu had spent  her life training for a role she could never fulfill.  There would never be an Emperor to serve, but  the need to serve had been driven so far into her that it consumed her  life.  Her friends had become her only  release for that need.  Zhu Shu could no  more not serve than she could give up breathing, but she was caught between the  need to serve and her own desires.<p>
  The fullness of that realization nearly made her cry.  She could see the memories Zhu Shu had of Ying-Ying and her feelings for her,  the attraction that had grown over years… and the actions her aunt had taken  when those feelings had been revealed… She could feel the hollowness Zhu Shu  felt when she looked at men… the utter lack of a response on any level beyond  friendship… <p>
  Zhu Shu might have learned to like men, Akane  realized, but her aunt had ground it out of her with her lessons on how to  please them. Zhu Shu knew a thousand ways to arouse men, to seduce men, to  please men, some of which had long ago become unconscious actions, but men  would never be to her more than a rote set of   reflexes.  No matter how ground into  her the role of seductress had been, she would never willingly consummate the  role with a man.<p>
  Men simply were not appealing to her, if not so  strongly as to be an actual dislike. She had no more response to them sexually  than she did to a rock.  Even Ranma, much  as she liked to look at him when he was female, evoked no real interest.  He was like a pretty picture, nothing more.  Zhu Shu had toyed with the idea when she had first met him, but interest had  died as he had proven that even as a girl, he was forever male.  Zhu Shu had become convinced she was doomed  to a loveless marriage and what amounted to giving her consent to being  raped.  She wanted to see her friends  happy because she was convinced she never would be.  Duty wouldn’t allow it.<p>
  Akane mourned for her. She herself had always liked  men, and had never even thought about women until Zhu Shu had arrived. The  thought of liking them sexually had been alien to her, yet Ranma had awoken  strange feelings in her that Zhu Shu had helped her define. She did like men -  Ranma had been right about her taking a long look that first day, and as  frightened as she was, she had also been incredibly aroused. He’d been so good  looking, and his response at the sight of her unclad body had drawn her gaze  like a moth to flame for those long seconds before panic had set in. Then, the  whole Fiancée thing had gotten her riled, and she’d hated him for being <em>forced</em> on her. What she had hated the  most about Kuno and his idiotic challenge had been the forced attentions she’d  had to fight off. If Kuno had just <em>asked</em> for a date, she might have gone out with him.<p>
  It wasn’t until that day she had listened in on the  conversation in the garden that she’d found out Ranma was just as unhappy with  being forced, and that he had been taking it out on her as badly as she had  been taking it out on him. It had robbed her anger over the whole thing of any  justification.  She had tried to find  every reason for not liking Ranma before then, and yet, she <em>had</em> admired him for the way he had stood  up to Kuno. As hard as she had tried to deny it, the attraction had been there  for Zhu Shu to see.<p>
  Zhu Shu had complicated her life enormously, but Akane  had to admit she had simplified it in some ways as well, ways which had  confused her immensely. She would have bungled her relationship with Ranma, she  was sure, and taken who knows how long to recognize or even admit to herself  that she loved him, let alone that she loved him in either form. How long would  she have fought herself over <em>that</em>?  Over admitting that his female side fascinated her?  How long would she have tried to convince  herself it was perverted had she not admired Zhu Shu for being strong enough to  admit she preferred girls?<p>
  Kodachi had brought it all to the fore. She’d liked  Zhu Shu, and had been fascinated with her preferences, but until her jealousy  had prompted her to try and seduce Zhu Shu, she had still seen her as a much  loved friend, too focused on Ranma to realize what she had come to feel for Zhu  Shu as well.<p>
  And Zhu Shu’s refusal to betray Ranma by allowing  Akane to succeed in her seduction had shaken her, had shown her a side of  herself that she would have rather not admitted to; a selfishness that was  willing to hurt even her friends for a pointless revenge over something that  had existed only in her own mind…<p>
  But Zhu Shu had forgiven her… had sent Kasumi to  reassure her. She couldn’t show Akane her love directly, but indirectly, she’d  done all she could to make sure Akane knew she cared. She’d given Akane all she  could and still be honorable.<p>
  Then… had come the Dance.<p>
  Whether she had intended to or not, Zhu Shu had given  Akane the greatest gift she had ever received. Direct knowledge of what it was  like to be <em>in</em> love. The traces of her  memories of Ying-Ying had shown her <em>what</em> she was feeling in a way she couldn’t deny.<p>
  Had the accident not happened, she probably would have  spent several more months of being terribly flirtatious before she’d dared to  admit to her love, even to herself. The mishap had changed that, it had changed  a lot of things… She’d grown up a lot that night. She had realized she loved  him… was <em>in</em> love with him…<p>
  …And with Zhu Shu as well.  That love had grown unnoticed, but it was  there, and it was as real as her love for Ranma.<p>
  What she had gained from Zhu Shu had enabled her to  see how much she had hurt her,  and how  close she had driven her to committing what was for her the ultimate sin…  Betraying a friend.<p>
  In Zhu Shu’s mind, betraying a friend was as bad as  betraying her Emperor… and there was only one sentence for treason.<p>
  Akane had spent that first night following the  accident trying to avoid thinking, wanting only to bask in the wonderful  feeling she had gotten from admitting to Ranma she loved him. There had been  too much to assimilate, so she had pushed most of it aside, but the shame of  what her selfishness had nearly caused had refused to go. She had hated what  life had done to her… had hated it’s unfairness in taking her mother, in  forcing her to be engaged to Ranma, in having Kuno set all the boys at Furinkan  on her. But her shame had burned it all out… all the anger she had over life’s  unfairness. Yes, she had dealt with a lot of disappointments, but her  self-justifications had died with the old rage.<p>
  Then shock had set in over all the alien memories and  she had forgotten all but the strongest impressions. Her mind had simply refused  to deal consciously with everything else she had gained, and she had wandered  through the week distracted, but functional. Only the lingering guilt had  remained as her subconscious processed the alien memories…<p>
  That was what had sparked the rage at Ranma… the guilt  that she nearly had done exactly what he thought she had… guilt and the need to  defend Zhu Shu ... the one who deserved the accusation least…<p>
  She couldn’t remember too clearly what had happened  after that, just vague memories… she knew that somehow, her current hyper-aware  state was an aftereffect of whatever she had been hit with, and it was slowly  fading. Still, it had enabled her to absorb all the knowledge she had gained  from Zhu Shu. It was like she had lived with her all her life and knew her like  she knew her sisters, but the memories weren’t <em>hers</em> anymore. They had faded to the background as her mind had  re-sorted her Self from them. Only the skills had remained as hers, the skills  and a strange new sensation at the back of her head…<p>
  She felt along the strange new sense, finally  realizing it was a link… a connection between her and Zhu Shu… like they were…<p>
  Twins… that’s the only thing she could think of that  matched what she was sensing, the description of the connections between twins.<p>
  That link let her know that Zhu Shu was fighting her  own rampaging emotions as well.<p>
  She wished there was something she could do to help.  She knew she hadn’t been all that easy to get along with, and compared to Zhu  Shu’s, her thoughts and emotions raged like a wildfire. Calm, contemplative Zhu  Shu must be fighting a battle with what she had gained from her.<p>
  One thought came wending its way to the forefront out  of nowhere and made her giggle… Zhu Shu was probably having the hardest time  trying to forget Akane’s lack of skills at cooking.<p>
  Gods, she had been bad at that; her new skills cringed  when they contemplated what she had used to call cooking. She was glad she’d  never had a chance to cook for Ranma.  He  probably would have thought she was trying to poison him.<p>
  The thought prompted her to really take stock of what  she had processed and what she found shocked her. She had trained with her  father and knew a good deal of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts, but  she’d never driven herself as hard as Ranma had… she had never been a <em>master</em>.<p>
  Now.<p>
  She could recall the lessons with Zhu Shu’s  grandfather teaching her the Song School of Sword Dancing… the years of  training… learning how to focus her ki, channel it, use it… learning how to use  the twin broadswords, learning first to dance with the swords, then extending  her control to longer and longer ribbons… how to make them an extension of her  body, alive with her ki… <p>
  And years of learning to cook, to sew, to do all the  duties of an imperial servant, from lowest maid to Chamberlain… and the fun of  using her martial arts training to make the other work easier… the joys gained  by doing things better and quicker than her aunt expected.  The disappointments of discovering that no  matter how she excelled she could never gain approval…<p>
  And the whirlwind night where Zhu Shu had learned the  Dance of Shiva, the massive set of skills passed on in the same way she had  passed them to Akane.<p>
  But Sarhia had only given Zhu Shu the skills… not her  memories or feelings or anything else beyond the Dance. Why had it been so  different with her?<p>
  She had no answers and the clarity was fading… normal  thought was returning and with it, the sensations of her body… <p>
  She was laying in bed, and from the feelings, she was  in her pajamas.  She smiled.  It had probably been Kasumi; she always  thought of those things. She took a long languorous stretch and purred at the  sensations of the cloth on her nipples. Whatever she had taken had left her  very sensitive and… <p>
  She opened her eyes and slowly scanned the room,  seeing an exhausted red-head passed out in a chair next to her bed.  Akane smiled, her gaze slowly wandering over  Ranma’s body, coming at last to rest on where her shirt had fallen aside to  reveal one rosy pink nipple. Akane slipped the sheets back noiselessly and  tip-toed across the room. She knelt, a canary grin on her face, and gently  began to lick at the proffered treat.<p>
  Ranma moaned softly as her nipple hardened, then her  eyes fluttered open sleepily as a small gasp escaped her lips. “Wh- what are  you doing?” she whispered.<p>
  Akane laid a finger against her lips as her teeth  gently nipped and held the nipple and flicked her tongue across it faster.  Ranma’s eyes glazed and another gasp escaped her lips, followed by a moan as  Akane’s hand trailed down her body and slid inside the unresisting red-head’s  shorts. Ranma bit her lips to stifle her moans as Akane brought her to a  climax, her body arching as her breathe came in hard gasps, then she slowly  relaxed with a soft moan. Her eyes opened to see Akane licking her fingers. She  stared, questions huge in her eyes.<p>
  Akane giggled.<p>
  “Oh no… you’re still high as a kite!” Ranma muttered.<p>
  “Nope.” Akane propped herself on the arm of the chair  next to Ranma’s legs and looked up at her. “I’m fine. I’m just a little… well a  lot… horny. I guess in a way, this is to apologize.  You aren’t perfect Ranma Saotome, but then  neither am I.  We’re both going to have  to learn a lot to make this relationship work.   You tend to be thoughtless, and I, well, I do have a temper… but at  least you’re <em>trying</em>.  I love you, Ranma.  I know that for a fact.”<p>
  She laid her head down on Ranma’s breast as her arm  went around her waist.  “Even if our  fathers all of a sudden called off our engagement, I’d still want you to be my  husband.  We will <em>make</em> this work somehow.”  She  hugged Ranma tightly then lifted her head again, a impish smile on her face.<p>
  “This-” her head dropped again and Ranma felt her lips  close around her nipple again for a few seconds before Akane released it. “-is  a promissory note.  When we work out our  difficulties, and we finally get married… on that day, and not before, I will  take you to my bed as a man, and have you be with me as a man should be.   Until then… well… there <em>may</em> be occasions where I will want you to be with me like  this.   I’ve come to realize I like you  as both a man and a woman, Ranma.  I <em>want</em> to <em>be</em> with you, but I can’t risk being pregnant.  I will not dishonor our families that  way.  But I want you to know I want this  to work… I want <em>us</em> to work.”<p>
  “Oh, Akane… I am so very sorry for assuming you…”  Ranma’s voice trembled. “I-I want us to work  too. I’m sorry I can be a- a- a jerk.” She lowered her eyes. “ I-I just want  you to know that-” She stopped as Akane laid a finger against her lips.<p>
  “Before you go and give me permission to go and bury  my head between Zhu Shu’s legs-”Akane told the blushing redhead. “-I will tell  you why that will never happen. Zhu Shu loves me, Ranma, but she loved you  first, as a friend. She could not betray you Ranma, anymore than she could  betray her emperor, because in her heart, they are one and the same thing, with  the same consequences. Even with your permission it would still be a betrayal  because she knows she would have to give me up to you eventually, and she wouldn’t  be able to if we were lovers. She has my love and I have hers, but we will  never be anything more than sisters, because if we become anything else it  could destroy us. She could not bear to give me up and would destroy herself in  guilt, and I… I would not be able to live with her suicide.”<p>
  Ranma stared in dismay at Akane’s words.<p>
  “She was wise enough to know this… and despite her  desires, she resisted me.  I nearly broke  her, Ranma. My jealous fit over Kodachi made me do something I regret now.  I would undo the hurt I did to her if I could…  but I can’t.  I’m just glad she’s  forgiven me.”  Her eyes came up to look  into Ranma’s. “And I have to ask you to forgive me too. I’m sorry.  I love you and I regret what I tried to do  with Zhu Shu.  I- I was jealous. I’m  sorry.”<p>
  “Is that what you meant when you said I didn’t realize  what kind of friend she was to me?” Ranma asked.<p>
  Akane nodded. “In part. Whether you realize it of not,  she’s taught you a lot about how to love as well.”<p>
  “I-I just wish you both had trusted me enough to tell  me.”<p>
  Akane gave him a sad smile.  “I wish I had too.  I’m sorry.   I-I”  She gave the red head a  rueful grin.  “Would you accept that I  was stark raving insane as a defense?”<p>
  Ranma smiled.  “Only  if you can accept my being a blind idiotic jerk for ever calling you a sexless  tomboy.”<p>
  Akane smiled and licked her still hard nipple.  “Still think I’m sexless?”<p>
  Ranma shuddered “No.” she pulled her shirt back over her  breast.  “I must say that sexless was  probably the stupidest name I ever called you.   Though I had no idea you’d ever do any thing like this.” <p>
  “Get over it.   Nabiki was being mean when she said your being half girl was perfect for  me, but she was absolutely correct.  I <em>like</em> you being both.  I can’t do anything with you as a boy until  we get married, but damn it, Ranma, I <em>want</em> you!  And as a girl, I can <em>have </em>you, without the fear of pregnancy  or anything else.  Get used to the  thought, Ranma.  I won’t say I won’t get  mad, or even that we may do anything like this very often, but the possibility  of this happening again is there.  I also  plan to try and teach you a lot more about being female, because I think the  better you understand women, the fewer mistakes you’ll make.”  She gave her a near smirk. “And it’ll make  you a better lover too.  As well as give  me an excuse for stuff like this…” Ranma didn’t react in time to stop Akane  from swiping her shorts and leaving her bare from the waist down.<p>
  “Hey!”  She  stopped when Akane captured first one leg, then the other. She stared down at Akane’s  face over a tangle of red curls. Akane was grinning evilly. “What are you  doing? This is embarrassing. You have me displayed like an oyster! And why are  you grinning like that?”<p>
  Akane looked her over carefully. “Humm… an oyster? You  really don’t look anything like one, but now that you mentioned it; well, what  does one do to oysters?”<p>
  “Well, you-” Ranma couldn’t finish the thought as  Akane’s head lowered, and she had to grab a pillow to smother the moans…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“That was mean…” Ranma said when Akane got back from  the bathroom. “I had no idea girls could come that hard. I mean I’ve certainly  never been able to make myself orgasm like that.” She was still curled up in a  ball and shivering.<p>
  Akane smiled. “Obviously, you have no real idea how to  make yourself climax as a girl.”<p>
  “First time I tried I started bleeding everywhere. I’ve  only tried a few times since.” She whimpered as Akane sat down by her legs and  spread them apart. “Please not again… I couldn’t take that again… not right  now.”<p>
  “Relax, silly. I’m going to clean up the blood and  apply some salve. You probably haven’t noticed the tear yet with the nerve  overload.”<p>
  “You tore me? D-does t-that mean-”<p>
  “You’re not in danger of being hauled off for a virgin  sacrifice? Yes.”<p>
  Ranma blushed crimson down to her toes. She watched  Akane in silence for a few moments before she spoke again. “I don’t get you.  You’ve called me a pervert and slapped me silly for even looking at you cross  eyed, and now you do this…”<p>
  Akane laughed. “Don’t get used to it. I suspect that  whatever Kodachi gave me put me in this playful mood.  It had some weird effects.”<p>
  “I’ll say. You cut off Kodachi’s leotard and whipped  her to an orgasm while yelling at her about trying to steal me. She passed out.”  She gave a sheepish smile at Akane’s raised  eyebrow.  “Nabiki made a tape.”  <p>
  “Humm… really… I’ll have to ask Nabiki for a copy. I  don’t remember much past entering the dressing room.”<p>
  A light knock on the door announced Kasumi’s arrival.  She looked at the two girls and gave an “Oh, my!” before slipping in quickly  and shutting the door. “Zhu Shu said she saw you walking back from the  bathroom, so I came to see how you were doing.”<p>
  Ranma had frantically tried to cover herself until  Akane had smacked her on the rump. She stopped trying to move as a blush  colored her almost down to her feet and she gave Kasumi a sheepish grin. “Ah…  Umm… You’re probably wondering what I’m doing to your sister.” she said lamely.<p>
  “Oh, heaven’s, no.   I’d say rather that it’s what <em>she’s</em> doing to <em>you</em>.  And to that, I’ll say I’m relieved that if  she’s finally decided to play with you, at least she’s playing with you as a  girl.”<p>
  “Kasumi!” Akane rolled her eyes.<p>
  “Well it is sensible, Akane. It would cause ever so  many complications if you got yourself pregnant.” Kasumi chided.<p>
  “I know that!   No boy-girl stuff until I’m married.   Right, Ranma?”<p>
  Ranma looked from one to girl to the other, wide eyed  in shock. “Uh… I guess so.” was all she could say.<p>
  Kasumi laughed. “Poor Ranma. Yes, I am the real  Kasumi. I’m sorry if I embarrassed you, but I happen to agree with Zhu Shu  about treating you as just another girl when you’re female. So you’re like  another little sister. I’ve got quite a collection now, you know.” She went to  sit on Akane’s bed in a swirl of skirts. “And you’re going to be my sister by  marriage too, so get used to me being a big sister. And like I told Akane a few  days ago, big sisters are supposed to guide younger sisters in all kinds of  things… sex among them. I don’t mean to be embarrassing, but I’m not shocked by  any of this either.  You’re both engaged,  and hopefully mature enough to make your own decisions about this.”<p>
  “I hope so.   Took <em>me</em> by surprise though.”  Ranma muttered.<p>
  “And besides…” Kasumi continued. “It wouldn’t hurt you  to try and treat me like a big sister. I know you’ve been raised by your father  to be tough and strong, but you’re not alone anymore. And… well… until you find  a cure, you are going to be my <em>sister</em> half the time.”  She took in the look  that passed between Ranma and Akane at her mention of a cure. “That is… if you  still want one.”<p>
  Ranma looked at Akane’s face, the gentle smile she  had, and thought about what had passed in the last half hour and about what  Belldandy had said about love.  She had  fought this curse tooth and nail, but really, what could she truly say was  different about her?  She was still  Ranma, in either form.  Zhu Shu had told  her that there were times to accept what couldn’t be changed, to save your  strength for fights that can be won.  If  he was truly to believe Akane, this was a fight he might be better off not winning  at all.<p>
  Was it truly so bad to be a girl half the time?  A sudden thought occurred to her that made  her smile softly back at Akane.  Akane’s  happiness seemed to matter more than the curse.   Was that what Belldandy had meant by her heart telling her what she  really felt?<p>
  “I’m starting to think it might not be so bad a curse  after all.” she said quietly.<p>
  Akane’s eyes met hers and for once, no words were  needed. Akane’s eyes said volumes. Ranma smiled as Akane finished applying the  salve and patted her legs as she sat back. Ranma made no further move to cover  herself or uncurl, her eyes never leaving Akane’s. “I’m actually starting to  think that being a girl part time might be a good thing…” Akane smiled shyly. “In  fact… it probably wouldn’t hurt if I maybe learned a little about being female,  since I’m going to be spending at least half my life as one.”<p>
  Some people just have a longwinded way of saying three  little words…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu sat on her rock in the garden, her legs  crossed into the lotus position and her hands resting on her knees.  She hadn’t moved since she’d finished her kata  that morning, even when she had seen that Akane had woken a few hours ago.  She’d told Kasumi that her sister was awake  when she had come to retrieve the breakfast tray she had brought out to Zhu  Shu, listening as she had gone upstairs to check on her.  When Kasumi had come back downstairs twenty  minutes later, she had been humming merrily, pleased about something.  Zhu Shu suspected she knew what.  She had sensed Akane was very pleased about  something too.<p>
  She had to fight the wave of jealousy that the  realization had brought, something she thought she’d never feel, but Akane’s  emotions had made her own hard to control. In fact, Akane’s emotions made  everything hard to control. She had had to struggle for the last five days  against the tidal surges of Akane’s emotional roller coaster.  All of her years of mental discipline had  barely kept her functional amidst the chaos her heart had become.<p>
  It hadn’t been easy… and… Ranma was going to be the  hardest part of it all.  She could tell  he had come to terms with what had happened when he had been waiting for them  to come home.  Only Akane’s condition had  kept him from confronting her yesterday.   And if what she was feeling through her chi link with Akane was what she  thought it was, then he would be coming soon.   Akane was radiating a rather contented feeling that Zhu Shu had learned  to recognize from Sarhia and Ying-Ying: the smug warmness of pleasurable  coitus.<p>
  So… she sat and she waited, praying to the Dragon for  strength, knowing that sooner or later, Ranma was going to think he had found  the perfect solution, hoping that he’d realize it’s impossibility and spare  her, but knowing it was inevitable. <p>
  Ranma sat down in front of her, copying her meditation  pose.<p>
  Zhu Shu opened her eyes, and the sight she saw made  her smile. Ranma sat across from her in nothing but one of Akane’s oversized  sweaters, and from where she was sitting… She raised an eyebrow.<p>
  Ranma followed her gaze and blushed.  “The heart was Akane’s idea… she insisted it  looked ‘cute’.”<p>
  “It does.” Zhu Shu replied.  She closed her eyes again. “Something  significant has happened between you two. Your aura has changed.”  She strained to keep the jealously from  ripping free, danced across a razor’s edge to maintain her calm and be happy  for the two of them.<p>
  Ranma blushed. “Umm…”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a half lidded gaze. “Akane seduced  the right person this time.”<p>
  “Huh? How’d ya know that?”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed and repressed the urge to strangle  him.  “Your aura has changed, you are  wounded, Akane has trimmed your hair to suit her whim, your skin is still  slightly flushed, your chi is jittery, your chakra are disarrayed, you smell of  sex… and perhaps most important – for the first time since I have known you, you  seem to have an air of peace with being female… you finally seem comfortable in  your body.”  <em>Because you have been together, in each others embraces, and I envy you</em> she admitted to herself.  Ice seemed to  creep across her soul.<p>
  “I keep forgetting you don’t miss much.” Ranma said  ruefully. “Yeah, Akane had her way with me while I was too shocked to do more  than enjoy it. We- we had a long talk too. She said a few things that made me  rethink some things.”<p>
  “Like your curse.”   <p>
  “Yeah. I think maybe… well… I think I can live with  it. It just doesn’t seem so bad anymore.” She shrugged. “Maybe I should learn a  little more about how to be a female.”<p>
  “You have picked up a fair amount from observation,  though you should learn to flirt less obviously.”  <em>Because  it makes me  want to show you all the  reasons I can for why I wish you would never change back</em> her mind  added.  Savagely, she repressed the  images her wayward heart fed her. <p>
  “Uh… yeah” Ranma blushed brightly and put her hands  into the sweater, pushing it down to cover her curly red heart. “Anyway, I- I  came down here to apologize… for a lot of stuff.”<p>
  “I have already forgiven you Ranma-chan. There is no  need for further apology.” she said quietly, dread quieting her rampaging  emotions<p>
  “Yes, there is. I need to apologize for being a jerk  and for being afraid you were after Akane… and… well… for not realizing how  much <em>you</em> love me.”  She stood silently for several long moments  as if summoning her courage to speak. “And… I wanted to ask you… to… um… Will  you marry me? I mean if you marry me, you can fulfill your quest and you can be  free to have Akane and…”<p>
  …And there it was.   A tornado tore at her soul as ice wormed it way through her body.  So much worse than it had been when Ke Lun  had offered the same solution. Her heart and Akane’s emotions screamed out  their acceptance, but she knew what her answer had to be.  In agony, she gave it.<p>
  “No.”<p>
  Ranma stopped… and a tear rolled down her cheek. “But-  but why?” she whispered.<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. Now that the answer had been given,  her inner turmoil stilled, leaving her as frozen and alone as a statue on a  mountaintop, despair all that she could feel…   She stood and held out her hand to Ranma. They stood eye to eye for a  second before Zhu Shu stepped forward to embrace Ranma and to lay her head on  her shoulder, Ranma’s warmth not even touching the ice within her.<p>
  “Were you a woman who had fallen into the spring of  drowned man, I would be the happiest woman in the world. But you are Ranma  Saotome… and you are who you are, and all my wishing will not change that, nor  could I truly desire it, because I love you just as you are. You could indeed fulfill  my quest, for I cannot fight you, and I have all the proof of your love I need,  but always, in the back of my mind, you will always be Ranma Saotome, the man.  Even were you to never come to me as a man save for those times needed to  fulfill my duties and produce an heir, it would still prey on me. I cannot make  you pay for a failure within myself. My destiny is unhappiness, Ranma, I cannot  bring that despair on you because I love you too much.” She sobbed until Ranma’s  shoulder was soaked. “I love you and I hate myself for my weakness… for my  failure. Part of me wants to say yes, to let you take me and love me and do  with me as you will; to give myself to you and Akane and surrender for all time  my honor, my duties, my hopeless destiny. Let love conquer all, let passion  rule… but I see the hollowness of the lie and the misery it will bring… Even  so, were you to ask me again… I could not deny you twice.” Her voice broke. “You  could take me and have your way with me as male or female and I would not be  able to resist you. So much of me wants you to do just that...” she whispered.  “…to just take me whatever my protests and claim me as your right by conquest,  as a true Joketsuzoku warrior should be…”<p>
  They stood there for a long eternity while Ranma  stroked her hair and she cried. Zhu Shu clung to Ranma like a drowning victim  as she shook with sobs. Ranma held her till the tears were out, and finally  spoke.<p>
  “I’m sorry Zhu Shu. I- I came to apologize and to try  and make you happy, because… because I finally realized how much you mean to me…  and now all I’ve done is cause you further pain. I’m sorry.” She stroked Zhu  Shu’s hair again. “I- I’d like to argue with you, tell you you’re wrong, that  we could find a way to work it out, but you’ve never been wrong in these  things. You see so much more than anyone I’ve ever known. How could I tell you  you’re wrong this time? I trust you too much to doubt you no matter how much I  want to.”<p>
  “I am sorry, Ranma-sama… I am a failure as a woman…”  Zhu Shu whispered<p>
  “How can you say that? You are not! Not to me, not to  anyone who knows you. You are the nicest woman I know, and none of it’s  artistry!”<p>
  “Yet I am a failure in the most basic thing a woman  can be…”<p>
  “Oh, Zhu Shu. You’re not! Akane told me about what  happened in the dojo, and I know that your emotions are all confused. Akane is  acting like you, you’re acting like Akane. Zhu Shu... you are not a failure in  anything! You are one of the most wonderful people I have ever known.”<p>
  Guilt mixed with the despair and cut through her  soul.  “Don’t say that! You don’t know  the truth! You don’t know what I’ve kept from you!” she sobbed, her fists  clenching as she shivered in Ranma’s embrace.<p>
  “No. And I don’t need to know to know that you care  for me and would do nothing to hurt me or Akane.”<p>
  She pushed out of Ranma’s arms and tried to run from her  then, but blinded by tears, she stumbled and fell. Ranma knelt and placed a  hand on her shoulder. “Zhu Shu, what ever it is, it can’t be as bad as all  that.” Ranma said encouragingly.<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head and whispered “Shan Pu…” she  choked as her throat tightened in despair and self loathing.<p>
  Ranma started, and took a deep breath. “What about  Shan Pu?  Did she hurt you when we left  the Amazon village?”<p>
  Zhu Shu couldn’t look at Ranma. “She- she knows you’re  not a girl…” she whispered, her hair falling over her face and casting it into  deep shadow as she stared down at her hands, her fingers gouging into the soft  grass of the garden..<p>
  Ranma stared. “I don’t get it, if she knows I’m a guy,  why’d she chase me all over China  trying to kill me? I thought the law only applied to females?”<p>
  Zhu Shu whispered something Ranma couldn’t hear. Ranma  took her in her arms and lifted her face to see her eyes. “Whatever it is Zhu  Shu… I’ll understand.”<p>
  “What my great-granddaughter is trying to tell you,  Son-in-law, is that she led Shan Pu on that chase, so that Shan Pu could wed  you as the law requires.”<p>
  Ranma looked up in shock at the new voice, and  scrambled backwards in surprise. An old, old woman with long white hair stood  before them on the path. Beside her stood the only girl Ranma had ever feared,  but beside <em>her</em>…<p>
  Ranma blinked at the woman who stood beside Shan Pu  carrying a long clothed bundle.  She was  staring at him with utter wonder on her face, and a broad smile.  She hoped it wasn’t in anticipation of her  eminent death.<p>
  Zhu Shu collapsed into renewed tears as Shan Pu looked  at Ranma with narrowed eyes.  “Ranma  should not make sister cry!”<p>
  Ranma paled further.   “S-s-sister?!!!” She looked in horror from Shan Pu to Zhu Shu.<p>
  “Yes, son.” the woman with the bundle said  quietly.  “The young lady who has just so  ardently refused to marry you, despite her obvious love for you, is the  Blood-Sister of Shan Pu, your <em>other</em> Fiancée...”<p>
  Ranma blinked.  “Son?”  <p>
  “Yes.  You may  not remember me Ranma, but I’m Nodoka Saotome.   Your <em>mother</em>.”<p>
  Ranma’s knees gave way and she fainted…</p>
