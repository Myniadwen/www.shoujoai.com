<h1>Racer's Heart (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/racerhart-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Megumi Morisato laughed as they rode to the cafe just off campus, the 
two bikes moving almost as one as they weaved through traffic with skill 
and grace. Passerby watched in awe as the woman all called Queen was 
matched by the mystery rider, both poetry in motion. It was a pleasure 
riding with someone like this, a rider who knew her bike&#39;s capabilities 
intimately and rode with her all, much like she and Keiichi did. &#39;I 
wonder where she learned?&#39; she silently mused.

She also found herself feeling uncomfortably distracted by watching 
Chihiro Fujimi herself. The leather pants and jacket she wore clung to 
every delicious curve, and trailing behind her Megumi&#39;s eyes were almost 
hypnotically drawn to her lovely bottom. &#39;Geeze, I&#39;m practically leering 
at her,&#39; Megumi thought, feeling more than a bit flustered.

Chihiro got off her bike almost as soon as they coasted to a stop, 
sliding off the sleek machine with almost catlike grace as she put her 
kickstand down. She unclipped the throat of her jacket and unzipped it a 
bit, pulling her helmet off with a happy sigh, probably unaware of how 
Megumi watched her in fascination.

&#39;At least I hope she doesn&#39;t realize I&#39;m watching,&#39; Megumi thought as 
she hopped off her own bike, wishing she could manage it with that kind 
of style. She found her eyes pulled right to the sweaty flesh made 
visible at the throat of Chihiro&#39;s jacket and gulped. &#39;Get a grip,&#39; she 
scolded herself as she walked to her side.

&quot;You stayed behind me this time,&quot; Chihiro said thoughtfully, her eyes 
merry as she pulled her gloves off, &quot;did you enjoy the view?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Megumi felt her face go red as she guiltily thought of how she had 
been acting just moments ago.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Chihiro&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement as she reached out 
to squeeze Megumi&#39;s arm, &quot;I have the bad habit of teasing the people I 
like.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Megumi croaked, feeling her heart race at that gentle touch. 
Clearing her tight throat she asked, &quot;Do you want to go in?&quot;

&quot;Lets,&quot; Chihiro agreed. She lead the way in and Megumi found herself 
watching the graceful swing of her hips.

The cafe was a popular one, packed by students from the nearby technical 
school as well as local towns people. The tables weren&#39;t packed but it 
was busy, servers rushing about, people talking and men and women 
packing the front counter. Of course Megumi&#39;s status as Queen of the 
racers helped here, too and they were able to cut to the head of the 
line fast.

&quot;You come in pretty handy,&quot; Chihiro chuckled as Megumi blushed again.

They ordered lunches at the counter them moved to a corner table, 
sitting down across from one another as they separated their chopsticks 
with a snap. Trying to get her self control back Megumi asked, &quot;So you 
were once the Queen, too?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I held on to the title for my last few years at Nekomi Tech,&quot; 
Chihiro agreed, scooping up a serving of rice. White teeth flashed as 
she put it in her mouth, tongue running across her lips sexily to clean 
them.

Megumi looked up to meet impish eyes, trying to focus on her own food. 
&quot;I never intended to be Queen,&quot; she quietly confessed, &quot;I just happened 
to be the unlucky sucker the Queen decided to challenge that day.&quot;

&quot;It must have been a shock when you beat her,&quot; Chihiro said as she 
stabbed a bit of meat, munching on it happily.

&quot;She challenged me again the next day,&quot; Megumi agreed, &quot;and couldn&#39;t 
believe I beat her o a stock bike. She was certain there was a secret.&quot;

&quot;Guess she didn&#39;t understand how you put everything you and the bike had 
into the race,&quot; Chihiro said thoughtfully.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Megumi said, impressed that the other woman could put it in 
words. She found herself grinning, &quot;But we made her understand 
eventually.&quot;

&quot;We?&quot; Chihiro quirked a eyebrow.

&quot;Keiichi and Bell raced her in their old sidecar bike,&quot; Megumi quietly 
revealed, &quot;that pretty much did it.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Chihiro agreed.

&quot;Keiichi talks a lot about you,&quot; Megumi said after a few moments of 
quiet eating, &quot;he admires you a great deal.&quot; She looked up to meet 
Chihiro&#39;s eyes and with a blush said, &quot;I just don&#39;t get why you sought 
me out for a race.&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re the best,&quot; Chihiro answered and it was almost like she 
was flirting as she smiled at Megumi.

&quot;If you want the best, race Keiichi,&quot; Megumi said without a trace of 
bitterness.

&quot;I have,&quot; Chihiro answered. She took a drink of her tea, clearly 
considering her words, &quot;I sought you out because I couldn&#39;t get you out 
of my mind and racing you gave me a good reason.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Megumi blurted, blushing. She had embarrassed herself badly at her 
first meting with Chiriro, bursting in rudely, then all the craziness 
that followed with her family. &quot;Why me?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I love a polite girl,&quot; Chihiro dropped her voice to a purr, &quot;but I like 
interesting girls like you even more.&quot;

&quot;I never know when you&#39;re joking,&quot; Megumi said after a moment.

&quot;Who says I&#39;m joking?&quot; Chihiro asked. She leaned back to give Megumi 
some space, &quot;You remember what I thought about your dad at first?&quot;

&quot;That he might be gay...&quot; Megumi trailed off, eyes widening.

Chihiro had to fight back a smile at the look on her face. &quot;Drink your 
tea,&quot; she offered and Megumi realized she was being given a bit of time 
to process.

&quot;You.. I mean, I...&quot; Megumi stammered, feeling more than a bit confused. 
If she had a mental image of a lesbian, Chihiro was the opposite. It was 
taking her a bit of effort to bring the opposing concepts together, in 
all honesty.

&quot;If you want,&quot; Chihiro said with surprising gentleness, &quot;I can go.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Megumi said fast, &quot;please.&quot; She looked away, unable to meet 
Chihiro&#39;s eyes as she softly confessed, &quot;I think I&#39;m like that, too.&quot;

&quot;I hoped so,&quot; Chihiro said gently.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Megumi murmured, careful to keep her voice down in 
the busy cafe.

Chihiro seemed amused by her paranoia but cooperated, keeping her voice 
down. &quot;I fell in love with a classmate,&quot; she admitted, &quot;here at Nekomi, 
actually. Sadly she didn&#39;t go that way. When I left to join the racing 
circuit I met several like minded ladies... and things went on from 
there.&quot;

Megumi tried to imagine that life, racing and loving at the breakneck 
pace she was sure Chihiro was capable of. &quot;So why did you come back 
here?&quot; Megumi asked.

&quot;I was tired of doing something that had almost become meaningless,&quot; 
Chihiro confessed, &quot;I wanted to get back to my first love, building 
bikes.&quot; She paused, &quot;And I have to admit I had a breakup to deal with, 
too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Megumi said quietly.

Chihiro gave Megumi a searching look, &quot;And have you ever...?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Megumi admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve had some crushes but that&#39;s it.&quot;

Chihiro puffed out a breath, studying Megumi with real sympathy. &quot;I was 
intending to ask you out after this,&quot; she revealed.

&quot;But?&quot; Megumi heard the unspoken continuation.

&quot;I really wasn&#39;t expecting a virgin,&quot; Chihiro said after a moment. She 
toyed with her remnant of her food, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m ready to go out with someone too,&quot; Megumi admitted. 
She looked up to search the older woman&#39;s eyes, &quot;What do you want to 
do?&quot;

Chihiro smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s try something simple, like riding together some 
more.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Megumi brightened.

&quot;You&#39;re a great racer and I know well both have fun,&quot; Chihiro said as 
they finished their meals. She grinned suddenly, &quot;And if I continue to 
follow you I&#39;ll have a great view.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot; Megumi blushed again.

End.

Notes: Is Chihiro gay in Oh My Goddess? No, but she is very asexual. Her 
background in mysterious: she had a close female friend in school, she 
was chased by the guys in the motor club and said no, and after being a 
racer for awhile came home. Megumi is similar.. no dating guys, it&#39;s 
assumed a lot of female friends and is interested in &#39;boy&#39; activities. 
Now I originally intended this to end with Chihiro bedding Megumi, 
except that I realized it&#39;d be very morally iffy. Chihiro is a adult 
woman, Megumi a late teen, and the experience difference between them is 
fairly extreme.</pre>
