<h1>The Devil and Miss Urd (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Introduction: This is a sequel to the manga storyline
The Devil in Miss Urd, though I will hopefully cover
enough details in the story to make it understandable.

----------

Mara fought back a shiver as she looked over at the
leather clad evil side of the Goddess Urd, who strode
across the room towards her with the grace of a
hunting cat. Urd paused, gazing into Mara&#39;s eyes with
a unreadable expression, then she suddenly grabbed
Mara by the front of her robes, pulling her in close.

&quot;What...?&quot; Mara squeaked out.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Urd purred then drew her into a fierce kiss!

Mara felt the soft lips press down on hers, the tongue
forcefully seeking entrance into her mouth, and she
wondered why she felt so unaffected by it all.
Separating, she looked up into Urd&#39;s eyes, looking for
something in them but what, she did not know...

The evil Urd suddenly pushed the off-balance Mara away
from her and on to the ground, a furious look on her
beautiful, arrogant face. &#147;You don&#39;t want me,&#148; Urd
said to her harshly, then suddenly began to loudly
laugh as if she had discovered some incredible joke.
&#147;You want what I was, the good and evil sides united!&#148;
Urd said, leaving a stunned Mara laying sprawled on
the floor behind her as she walked away, still
laughing softly and cruelly.

&lt;0o0o0o0o0o&gt;

That memory haunted her some days later as Mara paced
the small room in the temple that was the Morisato
home restlessly, like a tiger in a cage as she waited
for some word, some sign of progress. `What have I
done?&#39; she thought to herself angrily. She was haunted
by the madness and fury she had seen in the demon
Urd&#39;s eyes.

&#147;Was the evil Urd right about me?&#148; Mara asked herself
in a whisper, tears glimmering in her eyes. She didn&#39;t
want to think about it, but...

With a sigh Mara admitted that she had really done it
this time. Using a device she had successfully split
Urd into the two aspects of her nature, one Goddess
pure the other whole Demon, but then things had gone
terribly wrong. Unrestrained by her good half the
demon Urd sought pure destruction, in the process
willing to overload her body to do in.

Desperate to save Urd&#39;s life Mara had brought the
device to the Goddess&#39; two sisters, and together they
had hatched a desperate plan to reunite the two
halves. Bailing the evil half with her hated good self
they had snared Demon Urd, and now Belldandy and Skuld
worked tirelessly to undo the harm she had wrought.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Keiichi said softly, &quot;they&#39;ll do
everything they can to save her.&quot;

&quot;I know that,&quot; Mara scowled at the short, black haired
young man, then softened a bit as she admitted, &quot;I
just wish I was in there to help....&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; Belldandy smiled as she and Skuld finally
stepped out from the next room.

&#147;How is she? Will she be all right?&#148; Mara demanded
fiercely, stepping close to them and grabbing
Belldandy by the shoulders.

Belldandy smiled up at Mara happily, her brown hair
flowing gracefully down her back. &#147;She&#39;ll be fine,&quot;
she said in her usual musical tones, &quot;we reintegrated
the angel and devil sides of herself, in part thanks
to that device you brought back to us.&#148;

&quot;Good,&quot; Keiichi grinned, &quot;Urd may be annoying, but
we&#39;d miss her if she was gone.&quot;

&#147;Of course your device helped, it was what you used to
cause the split in the first place,&#148; Skuld growled out
angrily, the little black haired Goddess obviously not
as willing to forgive Mara as her big sister was. She
glared fiercely at Mara, who actually looked a bit
uncomfortable.

Belldandy gave Skuld a scolding look then turned to
look at Mara. &#147;The important thing is, Urd is going to
be all right.&#148; she said calmly.

&quot;I&#39;m... so glad,&quot; Mara slumped, shocked at how
relieved she felt.

A slightly embarrassed Skuld looked over at Mara
thoughtfully. &#147;Why did you bring the device back here,
anyway?&#148; she asked, frowning as if confronted by a
difficult puzzle. &#147;The devil Urd was really angry with
you,&#148; she added, referring to how Mara had turned up
at their door, smoking faintly from Urd&#39;s lightning
attacks.

Mara shrugged as casually as she could manage. &#147;I told
you, I haven&#39;t beat Urd at Tetris yet.&#148; she answered
them simply. Looking up, she reluctantly met the two
goddess&#39; piercing gaze and felt as if they are trying
to see into her soul.

&#147;And was that the only reason you risked your very
life to try to save hers ?&#148; Belldandy asked her a
little sadly.

Mara stood there in the hallway frozen, almost looked
trapped for a moment. Then, with a clearly frightened
expression on her face, she disappeared.

&quot;Wait, Urd would want to see you,&quot; Keiichi chased
after her only to give up a few moments later,
returning to Belldandy&#39;s side.

Belldandy sighed softly, &quot;I hope she&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

&lt;0o0o0o0o0o&gt;

A few weeks later Mara stalked around her rooms
angrily, dressed in her jeans, T-shirt, black leather
jacket and knee high leather boots. She stopped, then
suddenly yanked open the apartment door and headed out
into the street. The weather looked ominous, black
clouds churning violently overhead and suiting her
black mood perfectly.

`Why are those words and that stupid question
Belldandy asked bothering me so damn much?&#39; Mara
thought to herself angrily, almost seeing red as she
stomped down the street. `It doesn&#39;t matter why I
wanted to save Urd, so why do they care?! Their
precious elder sister is fine, they should be
satisfied with that.&#39;

Mara looked up to the dark sky a moment and saw the
rolling thunder clouds beginning to gather there.
Suddenly an image flashed in her mind, Urd with her
hand stretched up to the sky, calling down her
lightning bolts, and the beauty of that image almost
pierced her heart.

`What is this feeling?&#39; a deeply shaken Mara thought
as her heart pounded in her chest. `I can&#39;t seem to
work or concentrate, I just think about how near I
came to losing her.&#39; She shook her head a moment. `I
know I have to do something,&#39; Mara thought to herself
wearily. She walked a bit farther, and saw a telephone
booth. Without letting herself think about it, she
stepped up and quickly dialed the number she long ago
memorized.

&#147;Morisato residence!&#148; Belldandy&#39;s cheerful voice came
over the line, &#147;Who is calling, please?&#148; Unable to
speak, Mara hung up the phone, softly.

Belldandy put the receiver down, frowning to herself
slightly. &#147;Skuld, did you do something with the
phone?&#148; she yelled down the hallway, receiving a
quickly shouted back, no, in response.

Mara stumbled away from the booth and walked on for a
few moments as the sudden sound of thunder rattled
some of the nearby windows. At last the sky opened up
and the rains finally began, pouring down in a
cleansing wave over the dirty city. Dodging the storm,
she found shelter by crouching in an nearby doorway.

Mara stayed there, curled up in the doorway as the
rain beat down on the city. Her thoughts and memories
chased each other around like cats and dogs, never
giving her any rest. She remembered when she had first
met Urd, a young Goddess and herself, a young Devil
who became such unlikely friends. The good times they
had together down through the years, the wild parties
and even wilder drinking. Even the time she had been
forced to serve Urd in her role as the Queen of
Terror, she let all her memories of Urd wash over her
until she finally understood what she had to do.

She had to go see Urd.</pre>
