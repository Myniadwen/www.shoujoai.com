<h2>Unexpected Meetings</h2>
<p>Ranma was running down the street, being chased by  Genma. Under normal circumstances, this might have drawn some attention: a  raised eyebrow, or perhaps a second look.<p>
  But, since it was raining...<p>
  Needless to say, a cute redhead being chased by a  giant panda drew more than a <em>little</em> notice. People dove out of their way as Ranma skidded to a halt in the middle  of the street.<p>
  He’d been following Genma to a friend’s house just a  few minutes earlier, and had actually been glad to get back to Japan and away  from the backwaters of China.  He’d gotten so tired of having to build fires just to warm water that he’d  given up several weeks ago and spent the rest of his time in China as a female;  it had just become too much effort to try and avoid the constant drenching that  seemed to come with the curse. He’d no sooner turn male than something would  happen to get him wet again. Even dealing with periods was better than being  wet all the time.<p>
  Besides, it had seemed like every time they stopped to  rest, Shan Pu had almost caught them. The Amazon had been nearly impossible to  dodge. Sheer luck, and a convoluted trail, had kept him from having to face any  of the slow agonizing deaths the Guide had painted for him at Shan Pu’s hands.  The Guide had seemed oblivious to the effects his stories had on the pair of  them as he droned on and on to pass the time while traveling. Ranma had no idea  how much of his confusing ramblings were true or due to embellishment, but he  had more than one nightmare about the bloodthirsty girl during the two months  she had chased them around China.  He’d even taken to wearing Chinese clothing and wearing his hair in a queue  just to be inconspicuous and not leave an obvious trail for the Amazon. Genma  had flat out refused to head back to Japan until they were sure they had  lost the girl for good. Then he’d taken a few days in a seaside village on the  west coast of Honshu just to make sure she  hadn’t found them again.<p>
  After all of that, Japan had seemed like a haven. He’d  looked forward to spending most of his time as a male again. Zhu Shu may have  taught him enough about being female that it hadn’t been that bad being one  full time in China,  but he was male and wanted to stay that way for longer than a few hours at a  time.<p>
  He’d even looked forward to meeting the Tendos -  friends of Genma’s that they were going to stay with for a while...<p>
  Then Genma had told him he was going to have to marry  one of them.<p>
  It had been the last straw! A curse, a homicidal  Amazon, and now a betrothal! Enough was enough!<p>
  He faced the panda across the rapidly emptying street,  then Genma lunged and he launched himself over the massive paw. “Yo! Cut that  out!!’<p>
  Ranma’s return kick sent Genma flying. Ranma set  himself as the panda rose in front of the muttering crowd. “Your move!” he  called. Genma responded with a flurry of blows which forced Ranma to duck furiously.<p>
  “Well, I still say,” he dodged a fast moving paw, “this  whole thing sucks!” Ranma snagged the paw before Genma could pull it back. “Picking  my fiancée for me...” Genma flipped and hit the ground with a loud <em>TWHOOOOM</em> as Ranma finished. “...without  even asking!!!”<p>
  The panda lay there like he was unconscious as Ranma  pushed his braid back over his shoulder. Homicidal Amazons were better than  this! And maybe if he could find Zhu Shu again, she could help him search for a  cure. “I’m going back to China!  So suck on that, old man!!!”<p>
  He picked up his pack and shoes, then started trudging  back down the street. Behind him, Genma sat up, casually grabbed a street sign,  and whacked him across the head with it. Ranma’s triumphant thoughts fled  before a tidal wave of darkness.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rain was supposed to be a cleansing, a refreshing of  the Earth as it washed down the dust and fed thirsty crops. All of her life,  Shan Pu had liked rain.<p>
  Until she came to Tokyo.<p>
  Now, it was just another sign of the depression she  had sunk into. She had never thought any place could ever be as huge as Tokyo. Nine days of  searching high and low had revealed not a single clue to Ranma’s whereabouts,  and she had only explored a small part of the city. It was far worse than she  had anticipated, and she had not counted on the problems she had encountered as  a girl alone in Tokyo.  While she had been safe enough from the one mugger she had met, she spoke poor  Japanese, and what little money she possessed had soon been spent. Nothing in  her life as an Amazon warrior had prepared her for a place like this insane  city.<p>
  At present she was setting in the rain on a low  railing, overlooking one of the city’s drainage canals and feeling like she  would never redeem her honor by finding her husband.<p>
  After losing Ranma in China, it had been logical to  suspect he had finally returned home, so they had come to Tokyo by boat. It had seemed like such a  smart suggestion for her and Zhu Shu to split up and search the city for him.  In retrospect, it had been anything but. She had come no closer to finding her  groom, and had not seen her blood-sister in days. Now, to top it all off, she’d  been caught in the sudden rain and was stuck as a cat till she found hot water.<p>
  She growled in aggravation, once more cursing the  arrogant prince who’d...<p>
  “Ya know, you’re feeling schorry for yourself loud ‘nough  to wake the dead,” a slurred voice said from behind her.<p>
  Shan Pu turned, the voice coming from so close behind  nearly making her jump out of her skin. The woman it belonged to was a sight  that made her blink several times in hopes of banishing the vision. It didn’t.<p>
  The white haired woman seemed to be having trouble  standing steady, and stank of rice wine. She was pretty enough, and dressed in  a very revealing outfit, but the tattoos on her face were a trifle odd. She  stumbled to the rail and leaned over, nearly falling into the canal and out of  her dress before righting herself. Shan Pu blinked at her again as she gave a  questioning mew.<p>
  The white-haired women brushed her bangs back from her  face and looked down at her. “Oh, yeah. I’m... I’m... Oh yeah, Urd. Goddesh  schecond class.” She slumped to the ground beside the rail. “An’ on pro...  pro... probation.” She held out a bottle of sake. “Want schome?”<p>
  Sham Pu sniffed the bottle, her whiskers curling at  the smell. Urd laughed. “No... prolly not. Got a cat’s tongue... Cat’s got your  tongue,” she giggled. “Scho anyway... you got nothing to feel schorry for. Now  me... thas ‘nother schory. Try bein’ the host for tha’ Lord a’ Terror. At least <em>you</em> didn’t nearly destroy tha’ world!”<p>
  Shan Pu sighed. A drunk. Just what she needed on top  of every thing else. She started to turn when she felt fingers grasp her by the  neck and lift her in front of the drunken woman’s face. She tried to turn to  bite her, or get her claws into her, but try as she might she couldn’t reach.<p>
  “Schimmer down, Schampoo,” the woman said. The shock  of hearing her name used caused Shan Pu to stare at the self-proclaimed  goddess. “I heard you in the bar, and I schaid to... to myschelf... I schaid,  Urd... now there’s schomeone who could use a little of the old Urd magic...”  She looked Shan Pu in the eye. “Scho I came over... Just for you! Don’t you  feel special?”<p>
  Shan Pu gave her a raised eyebrow. Special? She was being  dangled by the scruff of her neck by a thoroughly drunk woman who was  delusional, and she was supposed to feel <em>special</em>?<p>
  “I am not de... de... delusional!” Urd protested  drunkenly. “I’m a Goddess of Love!”<p>
  If Shan Pu could have crossed her arms, she would  have. If she wasn’t stuck as a cat, she could show this crazy lady this was not  how you treated an Amazon!<p>
  “I... I can prove I’m a goddessh,” Urd slurred, taking  another slug on her bottle. “You betcha!”<p>
  Shan Pu rolled her eyes. She was stuck for the moment,  but when she got free, oh the scratching Urd was going to get!<p>
  “I can!” Urd drained the bottle of sake and tossed it  behind her. She stood, staggering and stumbled to the center of the alley. “Jus’  watch!” She started reaching into various concealed pockets and pulling out  odds and ends: sunglasses, a walkman, a few CDs, but not what she was obviously  looking for. Finally, failing to find the object of her search, Urd grumbled “Dammit!  I left my ID schomewhere!” She blearily looked at Shan Pu, obviously almost  drunk enough to fall unconscious.<p>
  “Well, I guess I got one way left.” She looked around  conspiratorially. “I’m not- not schposed to do this, but hey, whathahell,  right? Not like I can get in more trou- trou- trouble. Scho tell me cat, wha’s  your wish?”<p>
  For Urd to put her down for one thing, so she could  get on with looking for Ranma, and get away from the crazy woman. She struggled  again against the woman’s grip, but it was useless. Urd was hanging on  desperately.<p>
  “No, come on, really! A real wish.” Urd was almost  pleading. “I can schow you I’m a real goddessh. I can! Wha’s your mos’  heartfelt wish? I can do it, I know I can!”<p>
  Fine. She wished that her relationship with Ranma  would work out happily for everyone concerned! But most of all, she wanted to  be let go!!!<p>
  Urd blinked at her twice, seemingly stunned, then her  eyes lost focus as the tattoo on her forehead blazed into light. Shan Pu blinked  repeatedly as Urd’s head tilted back and she stared at the sky, the blaze on  her forehead growing brighter and brighter. A wind kicked up around the alley  as small objects started floating and Urd lifted off the ground.<p>
  Urd’s hand released, and Shan Pu drifted to in front  of the floating woman, scrabbling madly at the air as she tried to crawl to the  ground.  She stopped as wisps of light  swirled around the alley. A feeling like static filled the area as the very air  seemed to hum with power. The faint sound at the very edge of her hearing began  to build, like a bass rumble so low she could only feel it. It built until it  seemed the ground must surely crumble beneath the weight of the sound.<p>
  Then a shaft of argent light shot towards the heavens,  the glow so intense Shan Pu had to put her paws across her eyes. Then, as the  light, and pressure faded, she found herself drifting to the ground again,  looking as Urd collapsed to her knees and stared at her.<p>
  “Well, whaddaya know. Your wish has been approved.”  Urd whispered in shock before her eyes rolled back in her head and she fell  forward.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Zhu Shu had to admit she was lost.<p>
  She hated having to admit it; it was too close to  admitting defeat, that she had failed in her quest to find Ranma as badly as  she had failed in her quest for a husband. In the two months since she and Shan  Pu had left the Amazon village on the husband hunt, they had repeatedly almost  caught up to the pair only to have them slip away in the chaos that seemed to  follow them. They had succeeding in tracking the pair all over China to a  small seaport, only to find they had escaped by swimming to Japan.  Hiring a boat to Japan had taken a few days, but it  had been their first sight of Tokyo  harbor that had raised her first doubts as to whether they would succeed. <p>
  She’d agreed when her blood-sister had suggested they  split up to search, and since had learned how insane the idea had been. She  should have known better. Sighing heavily, she let her mind wander back to the  day she had realized she was in over her head...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It had been a  week previous, and Zhu Shu had been up a tree,  looking out over yet another school.<p>
  She’d learned quickly that Japanese teenagers went to  school longer than she had in her village, and that Ranma, being a year younger  than she, wasn’t even in the highest class grade. That being the case, she had  figured the schools would be a likely place to search for her quarry. She’d  just never thought there could be so many. This was probably the hundredth  school she’d checked in the last four days and they were all beginning to blur  together.<p>
  She rubbed her eyes, glad her year of wandering had  acquainted her with at least a semblance of how to survive in a city, though Tokyo itself had stunned  her with its sheer immensity. In four days, she’d covered a bare fraction of  the sprawl and was realizing it might take months to search the rest. She wasn’t  even sure where she currently was. The city had proven too much a maze for her,  and she’d been reduced to wandering from school to school almost at random.<p>
  A crash of thunder shook the air nearby and flung Zhu  Shu out of her tree. She flipped to catch herself on the wall of the school and  dropped down to the sidewalk near the gate, facing a young man who had just  bolted through it, running from something Zhu Shu couldn’t yet see...<p>
  “Save me! She’s gone crazy!” the boy cried as he  leaped into Zhu Shu’s arms. They both went down in a tangle... She tried to  roll to get free, and finally got her feet under her for a leap away from the  wildly flailing boy, but just as she jumped, his hand caught in her underwear  and she ended up in a heap on top of him when they caught around her ankles.<p>
  She kicked free and scuttled back against the wall as  the boy set up, holding her panties. As he leered, a young girl wearing a  tiger-striped bikini flew out of the gate.<p>
  “Darling! Will you never learn?! Must I always find  you with another girl!?”<p>
  “But... but... but... Lum...” he got no further before  the flying girl let loose with a lightning bolt.<p>
  Zhu Shu tried diving out of the way as the boy jumped  towards her, but with uncanny luck, she tripped and fell, landing on her rear  in a puddle on the sidewalk. Cold water soaked the hem of her dress as she  changed, the boy landing head first between her spread legs. He lifted his head  out of the water and looked up under her dress, a huge grin spreading...<p>
  “Nice view-“ was all he had time for before the hilt  of Zhu Shu’s sword connected with the top of his head.<p>
  “Pervert!!!” she yelled in Chinese at the unconscious  boy.<p>
  “Darling?!” The flying girl looked down in horror,  dropping to land beside Zhu Shu and grabbing the unconscious boy. “Ataru??”<p>
  Up close, Zhu Shu could see that what she had taken to  be hair decorations were actually small horns. “Wahhhhhh!!!! You killed  Darling!!!!” she wailed, revealing long upper and lower canines.<p>
  “Zhu Shu not kill! Just bump on head!” the Chinese  girl said indignantly.<p>
  “He’s not moving!”<p>
  “He knocked out! Of course no move!”<p>
  “Why’d you hit him?!?”<p>
  “He look up dress!” Zhu Shu grabbed her wadded up  panties out of the boy’s clenched fist, “and steal panties! Why you attack?”<p>
  “Darling was chasing the cheerleading squad again!!!”<p>
  “So why angry at Zhu Shu??”<p>
  The other girl looked puzzled for a second then  smiled. “Well... I suppose you couldn’t avoid him...” She sighed. “I suppose I  shouldn’t be mad at you... Of course he’s going to make a beeline right at  you...” She sighed again. “Darling can be so... so... aggravating!” She turned  back to Zhu Shu. “I’m Lum, of the Oni. This is my fiancé, Ataru Moroboshi of  Earth.” She held up his limp hand. “We’re going to get married!”<p>
  Zhu Shu bowed politely. “Song Zhu Shu, of China.”<p>
  The girl looked at her in confusion. “China? You’re a  native of Earth?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, puzzled. Where else could she be from?<p>
  “But you look like a Beast Girl! From a planet near  home!”<p>
  “Lum is not Earth?” Zhu Shu asked in wonder.<p>
  “Oh no. I’m an Oni. We were going to conquer Earth a  few years ago, but Ataru beat me in a game of tag, then asked me to marry him,  so Daddy called it off. I moved here to be with Ataru.” She waved a hand in a  vague direction overhead. “Home’s out that way a couple of hundred light-years,  I think.”<p>
  “Ah. Zhu Shu is of Earth. Has curse.” She smiled,  brushing her blonde hair back over her long ears. She understood now why the  girl had not reacted to her cursed form the way she had come to expect. Water  had proven difficult to avoid since Jusenkyo.<p>
  “A curse? Really?” The girl seemed excited. “I know!  Let’s take Ataru to Nurse Sakura. She’s a witch! Maybe she can help!”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow, then shrugged mentally. She  supposed it couldn’t hurt. She helped Lum pick up the unconscious boy. Between  the two of them, they dragged Ataru back to the main building, Zhu Shu stepping  carefully to keep her too-short skirt from riding up any more. At the Nurse’s  office, a few small bolts from Lum’s fingertips cleared off the small crowd of  boys from before the door, and they entered the small office. A tall gorgeous  woman looked up at their entry and sighed.<p>
  “Again? Lum, that’s the fifth time today! What did you  shock him for this time?”<p>
  “I didn’t!” She pointed at Zhu Shu with her chin. “Darling  stole her panties and she hit him with a sword!”<p>
  Sakura sighed again. “Great! Just what we need.  Another Mendo!” She waved them away towards an examination table.<p>
  Lum dragged Ataru over to the table, not noticing that  Zhu Shu stood riveted to the floor, her eyes locked on Sakura and a strange  expression on her face. Sakura turned from her small hotplate with a cup of tea  and caught the Chinese girl’s intense expression.<p>
  “Something wrong?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shuddered as she suddenly drew in a breath,  then blushed and looked down. “I... I sorry to stare. Please forgive.”<p>
  Sakura tilted her head. “What were you looking at?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked up. “Sakura have very strange aura.  Like nothing Zhu Shu ever see.”<p>
  Sakura’s breath caught. “You can see auras?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  “Are you a witch?”<p>
  “No.”<p>
  “So what do you see?” Sakura asked curiously.<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes narrowed. “Many images. Like spirits  that surround Sakura. Much chaos.”<p>
  “Interesting.” Sakura smiled. “I wish I could see  them.” She turned to check on Ataru. “As a witch, it would make things much  easier.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, still studying Sakura’s aura as the  nurse looked over Ataru, then her attention was distracted by the kettle on the  hotplate. She took advantage of the warm water while Sakura finished her  examination. “As for why my jumbled aura, I’m a priestess as well. I seem to be  a walking magnet for wandering spirits...” Sakura continued. “As for him, he’s  fine. Doesn’t even have a concuss...” She trailed off as she turned and caught  sight of Zhu Shu. “Wha- weren’t you a blonde a second ago?”<p>
  Lum bounced up. “Oh! Yeah! She’s got a curse! That’s  why I brought her to see you!”<p>
  “A curse?” Sakura shook her head. “I thought she was  one of your weird alien friends... A curse... I haven’t worked on a curse for  awhile... Let’s see...”<p>
  In a blink, Sakura had changed out of her nurse’s  uniform into a priestess’s robes. A small wand with long paper streamers folded  into squares dangling from the end appeared in her hand, while a cloth had been  tied around her head and held two lit candles on either side of her head. She  moved around Zhu Shu making passes with the wand and humming to herself. “Hmm...  Yes indeed. A powerful curse of a type I’m completely unfamiliar with...  Wherever did you pick this up at, dear?”<p>
  Zhu Shu stopped staring at the strange garb and  shrugged. “Zhu Shu fall in pool. Jusenkyo spring have curse. Zhu Shu get wet,  Zhu Shu change.”<p>
  “I see. I’m not familiar with Jusenkyo. Where in Japan is that?”<p>
  “Not Japan. China. Qinghai province.”<p>
  “Ah!” Sakura went over to a bookcase against the side  of her desk and searched for a moment, finally picking up a book labeled <em>Great Curses of China and How to Cure Them.</em> She  flipped through its pages for a few moments.<p>
  “Oh! Here we are... Jusenkyo, the ground of accused  springs... That is completely unhelpful! It says the only cure for a Jusenkyo  curse is to not fall in a spring in the first place! Failing that... hmm... It  says one curse can affect another... also it mentions a few items that affect  the curse... something called a <em>Chisuitton</em> that locks a curse... the <em>Kaisufuu</em> that unlocks them... Ah! Here’s an item that would be useful: a bracelet that  would allow you to control the curse and change at will... Let’s see... last  location... Joketsuzoku village... lot of help there... who the hell are the  Joketsuzoku???” She sighed and looked up. “I’m sorry, dear. It looks like I’m  not going to be much help on a Chinese curse. My Japanese magic would likely  cause unpredictable results.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu not mind. Curse livable.” She  really hadn’t held much hope Sakura could have broken the curse, no-one at the  Amazon village had known how either... but it didn’t matter. She hopped up to  sit on the counter. “Maybe can help in other way. Zhu Shu look for boy.”<p>
  Sakura smiled. “I don’t know about setting up a date  for you, dear. I wouldn’t trust most of the boys at this school to behave  themselves on one anyway.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Zhu Shu not look for lover.  Look for friend. Ranma Saotome.”<p>
  “Hmm... we don’t have anyone by that name in Tomobiki.”<p>
  “Ah...” disappointment colored her voice. “Zhu Shu  look elsewhere.”<p>
  “Wait!” an eager Lum called “I got an idea! I can help  you look!”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not know. Not realize Tokyo such big place. How find one boy in  city?!?”<p>
  Lum thought hard for a moment... then brightened... “Mendo!  He always seems to have ways of finding things out! I’m sure he could help!”  She grabbed Zhu Shu by the hand and led her out of the office. “And in the  meantime, you can stay in the saucer!”<p>
  As Zhu Shu was lead out of the office, she noticed a  hand start to climb towards Sakura’s breast. Without even looking down, the  nurse slammed a frying pan against Ataru’s head. Zhu Shu sighed. Hopefully this  “saucer” Lum was talking about would be free from the letches this school  seemed filled with...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As it turned out, the saucer was indeed safe from  Ataru, if for no other reason than his reluctance to allow Lum to drag him into  it, fearing she’d try to kidnap him to her home planet. Zhu Shu mostly stayed  out of sight in Lum’s saucer for the next week, staying out of Ataru’s hands as  the private investigators hired by Lum’s friend Mendo sought out news of Ranma.  She had found out on her first day it was safer avoiding the students of  Tomobiki, since she didn’t have Lum’s ability to shock the lecherous “Hentai  Squad”. All her means of defense would have resulted in visits to the nurse for  broken bones or blood loss.<p>
  Still, the saucer offered security from the roving  hands of Ataru and his friends, as well as Lum’s jealousy; dodging lightning  bolts had lost its appeal the first day. She liked the strange alien girl well  enough, but she was just too temperamental for Zhu Shu to feel comfortable  around her. In the saucer, only Lum or her friends Oyuki or Benten came to  visit, and she didn’t have to threaten to cut Ataru’s hands off every five  minutes. Besides, Zhu Shu had found out she loved to watch anime, and Lum had a  vast collection. She found herself engrossed in the adventures of various young  girls having adventures far more exciting than anything she had ever dreamed  of, and found herself wishing she could be whisked off to be the savior of a  magical world, or prove to be the long-lost princess of a fabulous kingdom.<p>
  Of course, the Hentai Squad knew she was hiding in the  saucer, and when Lum had let slip that Zhu Shu loved all the little cute  animals from the different shows, Zhu Shu had found herself quickly gifted with  a small mountain of stuffed versions in an attempt to get her to date one or  another of the boys.<p>
  That of course had led to problems with the other  girls at Tomobiki, to the point that Zhu Shu had finally just refused to come  out of the saucer for the rest of the week till Mendo’s investigators had found  something.<p>
  She had started to be a little worried about no news  for so long, had wondered if Ranma maybe had gone somewhere else, or back to  China, but the phone call from Mendo earlier today had reassured her. He’d even  graciously offered her the use of his car, Lum’s saucer being far to  high-profile for taking her to Nerima, where the pair had been spotted in the Ginza. Zhu Shu appreciated Mendo’s generosity, though it  had earned her a few muttered words and nasty looks from Shinobu, but it was  worth it if she could indeed finally find Ranma.<p>
  Mendo had carried on a polite and friendly  conversation with her in the car, until they had gotten to the Ginza, where workmen were repairing a broken street sign.  He made her promise to call him for a pickup if her search was unsuccessful,  then departed. A quick question to the workers, two men who were charmed by her  broken Japanese and short Mandarin dress, revealed she was only about an hour  behind the fugitive pair. She had tried searching an ever widening spiral, but  had quickly gotten turned about. Now, after wandering through the mazes the  locals called streets for hours, she had climbed to the top of a shrine in  hopes of seeing a landmark, anything that looked vaguely familiar...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>She surveyed the Tokyo  skyline over the cherry trees that surrounded the hilltop shrine in resignation  and sighed. Nothing. She raised an eye to the lowering clouds overhead, noting  the signs of rain scattered across the city. She needed to find shelter soon,  or she was likely to spend the night soaked.<p>
  Without warning, a beam of light pierced the heavens,  so bright it had made the night seem like a stark black and white drawing. As  it faded, clouds swirled around the hole the beam had made in the sky.<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, trying to clear her eyes from the  blaze of light. She had never felt a surge that strong. It had ripped through  the night like a hurricane, leaving her senses reeling and raw and her  consciousness teetering on the brink of the abyss. She closed her eyes as she  sought her center, slowly regaining her equilibrium as the aftershocks faded.<p>
  A footstep behind her caused her to turn quickly,  swords in hand. Green fire flickered fitfully along the edges, a sign of how  shaky her chi control was following the wild surge, but she forced herself to  focus. She’d heard no sounds of approach, and she’d found that in cities,  stealth usually meant trouble.<p>
  But the fires died as her concentration was shattered  by what greeted her eyes.<p>
  The girl who stood behind her was wearing a variation  of the typical school uniform that Zhu Shu had seen all over Tokyo, yet it looked far different in major  ways. White gloves covered her arms to her elbows, form fitting and trimmed in  red. Her top was fitted so closely to her torso that Zhu Shu figured it couldn’t  just be cloth. Her red pleated skirt was so short that it barely passed her  hips, and a large red bow adorned the back. A ruby heart held the center of a  large blue bow on her breast and a tiara of gold made a V above her blue eyes.  Her long shapely legs ended in a pair of red high-heeled shoes. Her  waist-length black hair framed a pretty face that was currently occupied with a  puzzled look.<p>
  “Well, you don’t look like a Cardian, but what are  you? I felt you the moment you entered the temple’s grounds, and those swords  fairly screamed with energy a second ago, but now you feel like a normal girl.”<p>
  Zhu Shu returned the puzzled look. “Zhu Shu is Zhu  Shu. Is only girl. Not know what other things is.”<p>
  “She doesn’t seem to be radiating any negative energy  right now, but her signature is really weird this close up. Similar to Ail and  Ann’s,” another voice chimed in. Zhu Shu spun to see another girl in a sailor  outfit, similar to the first, but in blue and white, who was looking at her  through a set of lenses.<p>
  “So is she a leftover Cardian? I thought Ail and Ann  took all of them with them,” asked a third, this one with two long blonde  ponytails and round odango.<p>
  “I don’t know,” Blue replied.<p>
  Zhu Shu counted five girls surrounding her and cutting  off any direction of escape. Her senses were still too raw from the  aftereffects of the wild surge for anything remotely resembling clear sight,  but she sensed too much energy for them not to be prepared to attack. Chi began  to flicker along her blades again.<p>
  “She’s spiking again!” Blue cried. “That weird  bio-signature is getting stronger!”<p>
  The red suited girl stepped in front of the orange and  green suited girls as they took defensive stances. “Hold it! Hold it! I really  don’t want to start a fight on top of THIS shrine!”<p>
  The other girls stepped back as Zhu Shu said, “Zhu Shu  want know who girls and why threaten?!”<p>
  All five of the girls looked shocked.<p>
  The blonde with the red bow in her hair recovered  first. “Who- who are we?!” she asked unbelievingly.<p>
  “Yes! Zhu Shu just stands here! No look for fight! Who  girls want fight Zhu Shu?!”<p>
  The twin pony tailed girl stammered “W-w-w-we’re the  S-Sailor Senshi! Don’t you know who we are?!”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.<p>
  “But, we’re famous! We’re in every paper in Japan!” The  red-bowed blonde protested, “I’ve even got a manga!”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not from Japan. Zhu Shu Chinese.”<p>
  The red sailor laughed, “Serves you right, Sailor  Venus. It seems your fame isn’t quite as universal as you thought.” The orange  clad girl looked crestfallen as the odangoed blonde stuck her tongue out at  her. The red suited girl kicked her in the shin, “Sailor Moon!”<p>
  “Wha-“ the blonde started, straightening up.<p>
  “Don’t you think we should introduce ourselves?”<p>
  “Oh... yeah... Right!” The blonde stepped back and  struck a pose. “For Love and Justice, I am the pretty sailor-suited soldier,  Sailor Moon! In the name of the Moon I... um... greet you?”<p>
  Sailor Venus broke out in a mad fit of giggles. Sailor  Moon glared at her, “What?! I’m used to introducing myself to <em>bad guys</em>, right before I blast ‘em. Give  me a break!” At Venus’ continued giggles, she crossed her arms and pouted.<p>
  The blue suited girl went next, “I am the pretty  sailor-suited soldier Sailor Mercury! For the element of water, I greet you!”  She ended with a sweet and friendly smile and added, “And maybe we can figure  out why you keep spiking on my sensors...”<p>
  The orange suited blonde continued, “For the planet of  love, I am the pretty sailor-suited soldier, Sailor Venus! I shall deliver love’s  heavenly vengeance!” She gave Zhu Shu a wink, “Or at least I shall to those who  deserve it,” she finished as an aside, then looked at the red-suited Sailor.<p>
  “For the element of flame, I am the pretty  sailor-suited soldier, Sailor Mars! In the name of Mars, I will destroy evil!”  Mars finished her speech and turned to look at the tall girl in green.<p>
  “By the element of lightning, I am the pretty  sailor-suited soldier, Sailor Jupiter!” She looked around at the other girls, “And  we are the Sailor Senshi.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stifled her laugh at all the posturing, then  bowed, “Song Zhu Shu, of China.”  She looked around at the Senshi, “Still not tell why want to attack.”<p>
  Just then, the still swirling clouds overhead let  loose with a light gust of rain.<p>
  “Energy spike off the scale!” Mercury shouted as the  other Senshi looked on in amazement at the suddenly blonde, animalistic girl.<p>
  “Possession!” Mars cried, “She is a Cardian!” She  began to chant as she pulled out an ofuda. “Rin, pyou, tou, sha-“<p>
  Zhu Shu recognized the scroll as part of a spell even  though it was in Japanese and her swords flared as she moved to stop the girl’s  casting. As she stepped forward, ribbons ready to tangle Mars’ hands, Mercury  cried out “Shabon Spray Freezing!”<p>
  Zhu Shu launched herself straight up over the spray of  bubbles that sprang from Mercury’s hand and coated where she had been standing  in ice. In midair, she crossed her swords and focused, “Dragon Tail Whip!”<p>
  The ribbons of Zhu Shu’s swords streaked down towards  Mercury, and at full extension launched a small ball of green fire at the blue  clad Sailor. It struck the girl in the chest in a small explosion that knocked  her backwards several feet.<p>
  Zhu Shu grimaced. The girl should have been knocked  out at least. She angled for a spot on the roof away from the girls.<p>
  “Crescent Beam Shower!” the blonde called as she  launched a shaft of golden light at Zhu Shu. Zhu Shu’s ribbons flashed into a  spiral dance around her as the beam split into dozens of shafts of light and  arced towards her. Her ribbons disintegrated, deflecting the barrage, but the  impacts threw off her landing and she came down badly on her ankle, twisting it  as she hit the roof. Through the pain, she sensed the ionization of the air and  Lum-born reflexes tried to move her away as Jupiter called, “Supreme Thunder Dragon!”<p>
  Her ankle betrayed her as the lightning dragon’s jaws  closed around her back. Her world went black and white, then only black...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma sat in the Tendo’s bath, listening to the crash  of distant thunder and wondering what his dad had gotten him into now.<p>
  Three Tendo girls, and he was supposed to select one.  How was he supposed to choose?<p>
  Kasumi was nice and all, but she exuded such a  sisterly aura it would be unnerving to actually marry her. He’d feel...  incestuous.<p>
  Nabiki was cute enough, but she seemed far too...  mercenary. He’d constantly fear she’d trade him in for a new car or something.<p>
  Then there was Akane: “Let’s be friends!” Could she  still be friends when she found out he was a boy? She had been so... vehement  about them after their sparring match.<p>
  But, she’d been so nice to him... Like Zhu Shu had. In  the months since he had left the Chinese girl, he’d learned what loneliness  really was. Akane had, for just that little while, made the loneliness go away...<p>
  Would she still treat him that way when she found out?  Finally deciding that there was only one way to find out, he stood up,  muttering, “I may as well go out as I am.”<p>
  In mid-step, the door opened and a fully nude Akane  stared at him, too shocked to even cover herself with her towel.<p>
  Just as shocked, Ranma stood frozen as Akane’s eyes  traveled down his body, then she took a step backwards and slid the door  closed.<p>
  He heard the sound of her putting on a robe... then  her sandals... Finally, he heard the outer door click closed and her leaning on  it to draw a breath...<p>
  “AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!”<p>
  In the dining room, Soun and Genma looked up at the  scream and the sounds of Akane’s approach. Kasumi and Nabiki, just starting to  bring out dinner, stared as a still yelling Akane ran past them to grab a large  stone ornament from the garden.<p>
  “I’ll weigh him down! I’ll drown him in the tub!!!”<p>
  Curious as always, Nabiki was the first to ask, “Akane,  what is it? What’s that for?”<p>
  “There’s a pervert in the bathroom!!!” Akane yelled.<p>
  “Why don’t you just kill him with your bare hands?”  Nabiki asked, ever logical.<p>
  Never logical, Akane could only say, “Because I’m  afraid!!”<p>
  With a worried look, Kasumi added, “That’s odd. Ranma  was in the bath just now.”<p>
  Just then, Ranma appeared at the end of the hall.<p>
  Akane glared as Kasumi started, “Who... who... “<p>
  “Who are you?” Nabiki finished<p>
  Even more embarrassed than the first time, Ranma could  only stare at the floor.<p>
  “I’m... Ranma Saotome.” He scratched the back of his  head. “Sorry about this...”<p>
  All three girls just stared in shock...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu stared at the unconscious woman and wondered  what the hell had just happened. Obviously, the woman really was something more  than human, but exactly what she had no idea. She had barely dodged out of Urd’s  way as the woman had fallen over, and had pushed her face out of a puddle, but  now had no idea what she should do. If the woman really was a goddess, it might  not be a good idea to just leave. It probably wouldn’t do to give her the  scratching she deserved for manhandling her like that, but...<p>
  The sound of a motorcycle pulling up to the end of the  alley interrupted her thoughts, and Shan Pu hastily pulled back her extended  paw and sheathed her claws. She backed into a space between two trashcans where  she could see Urd and evaluate the situation, as the sound of approaching feet  could be heard.<p>
  An absolutely radiant woman stepped into her line of  sight, dressed in a flattering outfit similar to what she had seen on young  adults all around Tokyo,  with a loose skirt and long grey hair tied back in a tail. Next to her,  carrying an umbrella, was another young girl – maybe all of twelve - with long  black hair wearing an oversized jacket and jeans.<p>
  The first woman bent down to touch Urd’s forehead, and  Shan Pu realized she had facial tattoos similar to Urd’s. Was this another  goddess?<p>
  “Is she okay, Belldandy?” asked the younger girl.<p>
  “She’ll be fine, Skuld. But she’s probably going to  have a terrible hangover.”<p>
  “At least we finally found her. When she disappeared  like that, I was afraid Big Sis had flipped or something.”<p>
  “I was too. I know she felt guilty over...” Belldandy  broke off and turned to where Shan Pu was hiding. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what  ever happened to my manners. Please forgive me, but I was so worried about my  sister I didn’t sense you. You must be Shan Pu? I’m Belldandy, and this is my little  sister Skuld. Won’t you please come out? I assure you we mean no harm.”<p>
  Shan Pu raised an eyebrow as she gave a questioning  mew. How could this girl know her name too?<p>
  Belldandy nodded. “I’m sure this must be confusing for  you. I am so sorry. Usually, we meet clients far more formally. I’m sorry my  sister was drunk. She’s had a very hard time recently.”<p>
  Clients? What ever in the world was she talking about?<p>
  “Oh.” Belldandy said as Skuld busied herself rummaging  through a trash can and tossing out odds and ends of metal. “We work for the  Goddess Relief Office. We grant deserving mortals wishes. Odd, though. Urd’s on  probation, and as a goddess second class, she’s not supposed to grant wishes.  But it <em>was</em> accepted by the World  Computer, so Kami-Sama must have assigned her to you.”<p>
  Shan Pu felt her head spinning, and gave up trying to  understand. She just wanted to get dry and find Ranma.<p>
  “You’re more than welcome to stay with us for a while.”  Belldandy offered. “Keiichi won’t mind, and I can get you some fresh cream, or  tea if you’d like to change first. I’m sure we can come up with some clothes to  fit you.”<p>
  Shan Pu looked at the contraption the younger girl had  built to move the unconscious Urd and blinked, then shrugged. It was obvious  that they were more than normal humans, and supposedly, she <em>had</em> been granted her wish.<p>
  She looked up at the sky, and the falling rain. It was  certainly a better offer than just staying wet.<p>
  With a tail twitch, she walked over and allowed  Belldandy to pick her up, and in a fairly short time found herself falling  asleep in the goddess’s lap as Skuld drove them all home...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The five Sailor Senshi stood around Zhu Shu’s  unconscious body as Mars finished her exorcism.<p>
  “That was weird.” Sailor Moon said as Mars carried out  the last few chants. “How could she be able to deflect Venus’s attack like that  and not be able to handle Jupiter’s lightning bolt? And why did my healing have  no effect at all?”<p>
  As her chant concluded, Sailor Mars looked puzzled as  well, “She should have changed back to normal and the Cardian forced out of her  if it was possessing her.”<p>
  Mercury tapped her computer, “That’s not the weirdest  part. Now that she’s unconscious, all traces of that bio-energy are gone, but I’ve  still got massive traces of the other kind. She’s definitely one of the sources  we’ve been tracking all week, but it’s wild. It’s almost impossible to detect  from any kind of distance, except when it spikes, and then it’s too quick to  triangulate. I’ve gotten three other spikes since we got her, but I can’t get a  lock on any of them. And those swords... I can’t make heads or tails out of the  readings on them.” She sounded frustrated.<p>
  “It’s okay, Ami.” Mars said from where she sat with  her hand touching the ofuda on the unconscious girl’s forehead. She looked over  the prostrate form. “Now that I’ve had a chance to get a really good look at  her, I think I know what your readings are. I’m so used to fighting evil  villains that I wasn’t thinking like a priestess,” she sounded upset.<p>
  “Rei? What’s up?” Sailor Moon looked worried. When  Mars was upset, it usually meant that <em>she</em> had screwed up.<p>
  Rei stood, “Usagi, help me get her down to a bed in  the shrine. I’ll explain inside.”<p>
  Sailor Moon nodded and moved to help pick up the  unconscious girl. Venus bent down to pick up the pair of fallen swords and just  for an instant, the faint dragons etched on the blades flared brightly.<p>
  Ami dropped her computer and ripped the visor off her  eyes with a cry of “Ouch!” She rubbed her eyes.<p>
  “What happened?” Venus asked, looking at the swords in  askance.<p>
  Mercury picked up her computer, “Silver Millennium  energy spike... off the scale. It almost overloaded my computer.”<p>
  “Silver Millennium?” Rei looked at her, “From the  swords?”<p>
  “I can’t tell. It was too quick a flash.”<p>
  Jupiter looked from the swords to the unconscious  girl, “What is she, Rei? Is she a Cardian? I’ve never seen one so quick.”<p>
  “She’s not a Cardian, Mako-chan.” Rei said as they  jumped down and entered the shrine. “And as a Shinto priestess, I should have  known,” She looked down at the strangely beautiful face of the changed girl, “It’s  my fault we nearly killed this poor girl. Her only crime was trying to defend  herself against the five of us.”<p>
  “Hey,” Ami called, “The readings on her are much  clearer in here. She almost glows.”<p>
  Rei nodded, “I thought that would be the case.” She  nodded down at Zhu Shu as Minako and Makoto slid back the doors of a spare  room. “This girl is probably perfectly human, and I suspect she’s under a spell  of some sort.” She settled Zhu Shu onto the bed and removed the ofuda, “I  should have known. Close as we were, I felt the spike when she changed, like  that huge bolt that occurred just before we got to the roof. It could only have  been magic.”<p>
  She pulled out her wand and transformed.<p>
  Back in her normal garb, Rei continued, “I’m a  priestess. I should have recognized it immediately. I suspect the surge you  keep reading is the spell which transforms her.”<p>
  Ami nodded and started tapping away at her keyboard.  Minako closed the door to the room and asked, “But what about that weird green  energy she hit Ami with? Or that flash from her swords?”<p>
  Rei closed her eyes and sighed, “I don’t know. Some  other kind of magic, I guess. It almost feels like ki, but on a level I’ve  never heard of.”<p>
  “Just plain old ki?” Makoto asked. “She’d have to be  some kind of super Martial Artist for it to be that. I’ve never seen anyone who  can manifest enough ki to even be visible, much less anything else she did.”<p>
  Rei shrugged, “It’s doesn’t feel ‘magical’ the way that  transformation spell does. Anyway, it’s my fault she’s like this... I’ll take  care of her until she’s awake.” She laid a hand along side the scorched girl’s  cheek. “She’s a hell of a lot tougher than we had any right to expect for a  simple human, even a cursed one. She’ll be okay, but we were lucky this time.”<p>
  Makoto nodded, “Yes. We owe her a big apology when she  wakes up. I’ll cook dinner for her.”<p>
  Usagi suddenly got a big grin. “I know!” she said, her  finger held up to indicate her great idea. “We can take her to that new Okonomiyaki  restaurant in the Ginza! That’ll make a great  apology!” She beamed in happiness at the thought. “And that cook is just so  dreamy looking!”<p>
  Rei nearly kicked her.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma awoke lying face down on a sleeping mat, a wet  cloth over a bump on his head and a memory of having smugly told Akane he was  better built rattling around in his skull.<p>
  “Ah! She’s awake!” Kasumi called out next to him.  Ranma’s head popped up, then pain hit, “Ooooooooooh...” Ranma said.<p>
  Kasumi leaned over, concerned, “Are you okay? Don’t  think badly of Akane,” she pleaded, “She’s really a very sweet girl... She’s  just a violent maniac.”<p>
  “Oh, good Kasumi. That makes lots of sense.” Nabiki  said from her seat next to Kasumi.<p>
  Ranma shrugged. He thought they were all crazy.<p>
  A few minutes later, after assuring Kasumi that he was  alright, Ranma stumbled down the steps towards the bathroom feeling the bump on  the back of his head. It still smarted. What kind of girl was Akane anyway? Zhu  Shu had been much nicer. Hell, even Shampoo had at least been understandable!  What was Akane’s problem?<p>
  Friends, she’d said! So much for friends when she  found out he was a boy!<p>
  He stripped in the outer room and thought again of Zhu  Shu. It would have been nice to have another friend like her, but it didn’t  look like that friend would be Akane.<p>
  He was reaching for the door to the tub room when it  slid aside. A once more completely nude Akane stood there.<p>
  Ranma was taken aback, and tried to think of something  to say as Akane stared at him getting madder and madder.<p>
  “Why... you... you... YOU...” Akane growled, then she  slapped him... Hard.<p>
  “So she’s got spunk,” Genma said after Ranma had  finally gotten his bath, “That just makes a fiancée cuter!”<p>
  “Cute is not the word.” Ranma growled.<p>
  Behind him in the dining room, Nabiki was discussing  the incident as well. “But you were both girls, right? That makes it okay!”<p>
  Akane refused to be mollified. “Okay is not the  word!!!”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Following Usagi’s comment, Rei chased the other Senshi  out of the shrine, and then returned to her patient.<p>
  “Whoever you are, I hope you can forgive us,” she  whispered as she knelt beside the bed with a bowl of warm water and a  washcloth. She looked over the scorched girl, taking careful stock of her  condition. Her clothes were charred and useless, as well as much of her pack,  but surprisingly little damage had been done to her body. Rei thanked her  ancestors for that. Gently, she rolled the unconscious girl over to check her  back, where the lightning bolt had hit.<p>
  Most of the back of the silk dress had been charred to  ash, coating the girls skin with black smudges, but here and there, faint  metallic gleams caught Rei’s eye. Reaching for her small first aid kit, she  took out a pair of bandage scissors. With enormous care, she began to cut away  the rest of the ruined dress. Afterwards, she took the washcloth soaked in warm  water and began to wash away the soot.<p>
  At the first touch of the warm water, Rei jerked her  hand back as the unconscious girl shifted back to her original form. She  watched carefully for a few moments, but there was no other reaction, so she  resumed. Cautiously, she wiped away the ash...<p>
  The first stroke revealed a brilliant pattern of red  and gold scales picked out in metallic ink along a sinuous form. Gently, Rei  washed more of the ash and soot away from the rest of the tattoo, revealing an  elegant Imperial Chinese Dragon. Golden eyes watched her as the girl’s breathing  seemed to make the Dragon writhe. Its long serpentine form crawled across her  back from her right shoulder in spiraling coils down to its tail just above the  joint of her left leg. Enwrapped in those coils was a long golden staff that  Rei found hauntingly familiar, yet could not place. In overall appearance, it  vaguely resembled an old-fashioned key topped by a large ruby.<p>
  In one of its four claws, the Dragon gently held  cupped a pink flower; a cherry blossom, so exquisitely drawn as to almost seem  real. A single dewdrop traced down a petal, almost like a tear. As she touched  it, Rei sensed an enormous sadness, and an almost unbearable sense of loss.<p>
  She looked away, not sure if the feeling was hers. Her  “feelings” were never predictable, or controllable, and she wished she  understood them better.<p>
  Another claw was reaching out towards a tiger as  beautifully drawn as the flower. It seemed as if the Dragon yearned to reach  the tiger, but it was just beyond reach. Rei had a strange sense of connection,  however, as if the Dragon and the Tiger were in some way a part of each other  in a way she could not describe.<p>
  She shook her head and moved on to the next claw. The  symbolism was puzzling to say the least. This claw gripped a sword identical to  those born by the unconscious girl, complete with the long ribbons, but those  ribbons twined about an object that Rei had to look twice at to be sure of. It  appeared to be an oversized spatula. The ribbons twined around the object in a  tight spiral that tied the two together as one.<p>
  The last claw also held a sword, this one’s ribbons  wrapped around a throwing star. The four objects made a complimentary spiral  down the girl’s back, from the flower on her left shoulder opposite the dragon’s  head down to the star on her right cheek; they formed a double spiral around  the golden staff, like a DNA helix. The artistry throughout was a master’s  handiwork, and surely, to have spent such a long time detailing the individual  items, they must possess a significant meaning to the unconscious girl, but Rei  had no clue as to their purpose...<p>
  As she cleaned the last of the soot away, a final  detail emerged. At the base of the long staff, just above her coccyx, a group  of golden symbols circled a gold ring with a dot in its center.<p>
  Rei’s breath caught at the sight of those symbols, and  her hand reached out involuntarily to the uppermost one...<p>
  Her symbol... For Mars...<p>
  As her fingers brushed the sign, a feeling of an  electric shock coursed up her arm and images formed in her mind... A pink  haired girl with sad eyes, waving goodbye, a black haired Japanese girl holding  twin tiger-head pommeled swords, a flash of golden cat-slit eyes glowing in the  darkness, a flare of fire followed by a vision of a girl dressed in a boy’s  outfit, holding out an Okonomiyaki with a heart on it, replaced by a female in  a red ninja’s gi, holding a fan and a spray of darts... A flash of light  illuminated one of the dragon etched swords, a golden fire burning along its  blade as the dragon blazed like the sun... As the light faded, the ring with  the dot burned in the darkness, then drew back to assume its spot in the center  of the ring of nine before darkness covered them all. In the darkness, those  golden eyes opened again, then as the dragon’s face appeared around them, it  drew back to form the heart of a burning mandala. Rei felt a surge of power  throw her backwards, and she lost contact with the tattoo.<p>
  As quickly as it had come, the vision passed, leaving  her no wiser than before. Shaken, Rei dropped her cloth into the basin and  willed her heart to stop racing. She looked at the still form of the Chinese  girl and whispered.<p>
  “You become more of a mystery yet.”<p>
  Finally getting a hold of herself, Rei finished the  sponge bath, then tucked the girl into the bed. Taking the girl’s swords to her  room with her, Rei sat and started to polish the soot off of them, humming a  song that was running in her head, then softly singing the lyrics.<p>
  It never even occurred to her to wonder that they were  all in Chinese.</p>
