I lay stretched out on the roof of the house simply listening to the 
soft melody of the brisk wind. It seemed I had befriended a bird; he 
landed on my outstretched hand and chirped happily. It&#39;s nice to be out 
of my office and out witnessing nature. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve 
been so relaxed and carefree like this.

I arrived yesterday morning and already I&#39;m one of the odd members of 
the family. I&#39;ve taken a shining to young Skuld; she shows great promise 
and strength, of course anyone who has withstood Urd&#39;s thunderbolts all 
their life would have a lot of inner strength. Belldandy is just like 
how I remember her from when we were young. Of the three sisters&#39; I know 
Belldandy the best, probably because as part of my spell training 
Belldandy had to mentor me. I hate to admit it but my magic was just 
like Skuld&#39;s back then, I had potential but I needed someone to teach it 
to me.

Today Peorth and I are going on a date. Peorth made sure Skuld and Urd 
were not to follow us around with a camera, else they suffer her whip 
torture. I swear Peorth likes to torture people sometimes. Peorth was 
getting ready so she could show me around. Of course, I know the area 
and earth customs, but it&#39;s fun to feign ignorance sometimes so long as 
Peorth is teaching me. As much as I&#39;m enjoying my holiday, I can&#39;t help 
but feel guilty for keeping a secret from Peorth.

When I came to earth I did so without an order or permission from Senya. 
And even though I got rid of the angel eater it doesn&#39;t ignore the fact 
I disobeyed orders; from the Head of the Valkyrie sector no less. At 
breakfast yesterday I told everyone I&#39;m on holiday and they all believed 
me, thank goodness Peorth believed me because usually she can tell when 
I&#39;m lying. In reality, the council suspended me from Valkyrie duties 
until the new semester starts. It&#39;s embarrassing I can&#39;t use any powers 
or magic, I can&#39;t even summon my angels, I can&#39;t even fly; I feel so... 
human. My power to protect has been taken away; I don&#39;t even know what 
my purpose is anymore. However, I suppose I&#39;m rather lucky usually the 
sentence for a second offence is demotion to a second class goddess; 
that would have been embarrassing. I guess the council does like me 
then.

&quot;Lind&quot; Peorth called out &quot;Where are you?&quot; I swiftly jumped down from the 
roof and landed right in front of Peorth. Normally I would tell her 
anything, but this I cannot. For one not being able to use my powers 
makes me feel weak and I never want Peorth to see me like that. For two 
I can&#39;t forgive myself. Despite the angel eater having infected me, it 
was I that decided to come to earth and because of that Peorth, Urd and 
Belldandy had their angels stolen. If not for me none of that would have 
happened, I made them experience that pain, I caused Peorth to suffer. 
So many times I promised I would protect her but yet it was I who put 
her in danger, I cannot forgive myself.

Last night I couldn&#39;t sleep. I should have been relaxed with no job or 
worries to occupy my mind, but I found myself waking at random intervals 
in the night. Thank goodness Peorth is a sound sleeper, (I swear she 
wouldn&#39;t wake up even if Heaven was being destroyed,) otherwise she 
would have noticed be continuously getting up. I couldn&#39;t sleep; my 
dreams plagued me with images of their lifeless faces and frail bodies. 
I was shaking when I awoke, I was actually shaking from the pure terror 
of the prospect that I could be the reason that my comrades, and Peorth 
were dead. I remember when I managed to lie back down I stare at 
Peorth&#39;s sleeping face. Her eyes are closed and her hair is splayed 
out...a pain grows in my chest and guilt consumes me as I&#39;m reminded 
that that&#39;s how she looked when her angel was stolen. Suddenly I felt 
sick, ill even and I know this feeling will never go away. The 
suspension, the guilt, I deserve it all, this punishment isn&#39;t enough 
for what I&#39;ve done. I can live through the suspension, but the guilt 
will forever remain in me.

&quot;Look&quot; she said and twirled around &quot;Do you like what I&#39;m wearing?&quot; I 
nodded and gulped, she wore an above knee length light pink dress with a 
red cardigan. She&#39;s not showing her body off as much as usual but 
somehow I find her even more irresistible dressed like this.

&quot;Heh heh the ice queen is blushing&quot;

&quot;...Whatever. Let&#39;s go&quot; I stammered out.

&quot;Wait, you can&#39;t leave in your Valkyrie uniform. We must wear civilian 
clothing.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care much for clothes so you can decide what I wear,&quot; I said. 
Her brow furrowed and her lips pursed together in deep concentration; is 
deciding what to wear really that fun? She quickly gathered a small ball 
of magic in her palm and threw it at me. My Valkyrie uniform glowed and 
morphed into form fitting jeans, a white shirt with a crop black jacket 
with 3/4 length sleeves. I looked at myself and I have to say, I looked 
cool. She even went so far as to have my name written on the sleeve.

&quot;Well?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I like it. Come on let&#39;s go now.&quot; She latched herself onto my arm and 
we walked out. At first she suggested that we warp to the town but I 
suggested it would be nicer to walk, that and that fact I can&#39;t warp 
anymore. Hopefully she won&#39;t catch on any time soon.

----------

The entire way to town Peorth told me of all her earth stories and 
adventures pointing out each of the areas it happened in. A lot of her 
stories and adventures seem to involve torturing, no sorry &quot;helping&quot; 
Keiichi...poor man.

Would you believe that this is actually the 8th date we&#39;ve been on? 
Because of our busy schedules in heaven and the fact that we both have 
to travel to and fro from earth we rarely go on actual dates. We usual 
spend our time during the nights or early evenings in my office, in the 
gardens or in either of our rooms. I personally prefer spending time 
with her inside the house than outside, perhaps because I&#39;m not exactly 
a people person. Even after all this time I think I&#39;m still nervous 
about going on a date with Peorth, silly isn&#39;t it? I the great Valkyrie 
Lind am nervous about going on a date. I suppose this is a symptom of 
being in love isn&#39;t it?

Dating on earth and the whole act of going out is completely different 
than when we&#39;re on Heaven, Peorth and I must be alert. From what I 
understand, some humans do not like the idea of two females dating. Of 
course on heaven there&#39;s no such thing, heaven&#39;s policy is that as long 
as you love a person it&#39;s accepted. Sadly, humans haven&#39;t gained that 
sort of maturity yet, and it may take another millennia for them to 
mature. I&#39;m highly protective of Peorth and I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s 
noticed but already I&#39;ve scared away several gawking men, and I&#39;ll 
continue to do so as long as they look at us weirdly or stare at her.

Peorth first dragged me to the jewellery shop. Inside there were only 
two other couples that were being followed by the workers, so luckily 
that left us to browse alone in peace. Peorth was instantly dragged to 
the necklace section and she stared enthusiastically at each of the 
decorative pieces. Some designs were beautiful and others made me want 
to throw them into the pits of hell, but I have a feeling they would be 
thrown back up.

&quot;Lind what do you think of that necklace&quot; asked Peorth as she pointed at 
a design. With one look I knew I wanted to throw it into the pits of 
hell, but what am I to say to her? I don&#39;t want to lie to her and 
pretend I like it, and yet I don&#39;t want to tell her the hurtful truth. 
&quot;I think it&#39;s hideous don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes it is,&quot; I said and let out the breath I was holding. I forget we 
have similar tastes in things. She held my hand and dragged me over to 
the ring section. I watched as Peorth&#39;s eyes seemed to shine as brightly 
as some of the gems. I can admire the jewellery&#39;s beauty but I don&#39;t 
understand why some women fawn over it like&#39;s its god gift to them.

&quot;Do you two lovely ladies need any help?&quot; I looked up to see a smug 
looking man with a wide grin on his face. His hair was gelled back and 
he stood with his chest out to exaggerate the manager badge he wore.

&quot;Can I see that ring?&quot; asked Peorth. She sat down on the stool in front 
of the counter and held her hand out.

&quot;Anything for a pretty lady&quot; he said and got his keys out. He got the 
ring out and held Peorth&#39;s hand as he put it on her ring finger. Her 
ring finger! Is that really necessary? He then started to talk to Peorth 
about the ring and he still held onto her hand. What a time to be on 
suspension, I swear if I had my powers he would be hanging upside down 
now. Curses if I can&#39;t use my powers I&#39;m going to do the next best thing 
to torture him. Where&#39;s a customer complaint card?!

Peorth was focusing too much on the ring to notice what he was doing, 
but oh I know what he&#39;s up to.

&quot;Miss the ring looks lovely on you, are you interested in looking at the 
matching ring for your husband?&quot;

&quot;Husband? Oh no no I&#39;m not married,&quot; laughed Peorth.

&quot;Really it&#39;s so hard to believe a pretty young woman like yourself isn&#39;t 
getting married. Surely you must have a boyfriend,&quot; he said slimily.

&quot;No I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Oh surely you lie. You&#39;re too pretty not to be dating anyone.&quot; This 
polite banter continued and I think Peorth actually enjoyed the 
attention. I swiftly found a complaint card and started to fill it in 
eagerly.

&quot;Oh Lind what are you doing?&quot; asked Peorth. I quickly hid the customer 
complaint form behind my back stood next to Peorth.

&quot;I&#39;m just looking.&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked and raised her hand up to show me. It was 
actually a nice ring; it was a simple silver band with 2 small diamonds 
surrounding the larger one in the middle.

&quot;It looks nice on you.&quot; The man took another ring on the case and showed 
it to us. It had a slightly thicker silver band with two diamonds 
embedded in the band and not protruding out like the one Peorth was 
wearing.

&quot;This is the matching ring that should go with the one you&#39;re wearing. I 
highly suggest getting both rings even if you don&#39;t have a boyfriend 
simply because they match so well together.&quot; He then took the ring and 
placed it on his own ring finger &quot;See how well we match miss?&quot; I 
couldn&#39;t tell if he was joking or not but either way I was getting 
annoyed.

&quot;Allow me to try that ring on,&quot; I asked as politely as I could muster. 
He was a bit fazed at first but took it off and passed it to me. I put 
it on my ring finger and showed Peorth

&quot;I think we look good together,&quot; she said happily.

&quot;We&#39;ll take them&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes really, you like it don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I do, I mean I like it! Yes I like the ring not I do no&quot; she said 
hastily. I motioned to take off the ring and give it to the man but it 
wouldn&#39;t come off. I turned it, twisted it, and pulled but it wouldn&#39;t 
budge. I looked calm and composed but really, I was panicking and 
cursing the fact that I can&#39;t use my magic. Is this how I&#39;m going to 
meet my end- death by lack of blood circulation?

&quot;Is there a problem miss?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Nothing is wrong. I think I&#39;ll wear it straight away.&quot;

&quot;I will too then&quot; said Peorth as she stood up and kissed me on the 
cheek. He didn&#39;t gawk as I expected but grinned then went to the cashier 
to finalise our bill. I crumpled the complaint form in my hand; he&#39;s not 
that bad I guess just flirtatious. I took out the earth credit card I 
applied for and handed it to him. It took money from my bank account in 
heaven and converted it into the currency of the country I was in. He 
looked at it confused at first but a smiled widely when the card worked.

&quot;Lind you don&#39;t have to pay for mine you know&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. Think of it as a present.&quot;

----------

We walked out of the shop and Peorth held my hand as she linked her arm 
with mine. The ring glittered brightly in the sunlight and blinded me on 
several occasions. I sighed in my head; we probably look like a married 
couple now...It&#39;s not a bad thing I suppose but still. That&#39;s probably 
the reason why she&#39;s enjoying herself so much. I sighed for the 16th 
time that day when suddenly she dragged me into an alleyway.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take this ring off for you. It&#39;s stuck isn&#39;t it?&quot; I nodded 
and turned away from her. Why is it she&#39;s the only one that notices when 
I do something dumb? In reality, I&#39;m rather clumsy and make mistakes but 
no one seems to notice because I always seem so composed. I can&#39;t even 
count how many times I&#39;ve done something stupid only for Peorth to 
notice and make fun of me anyway. She used her magic to take the ring 
off and held it in her hand.

&quot;Is that better?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Much better.&quot; I suppose this is why I love Peorth. She accepts my 
clumsy behaviour as a part of who I am. Somehow she manages to see past 
my exterior and love the real me not the me that the fangirls love. 
There is so much more to me then just my cold stoic exterior, and I&#39;m 
glad Peorth is the only one that sees that.

&quot;Honestly you didn&#39;t have to buy it simply because you couldn&#39;t take it 
off your finger,&quot; she scolded and frowned slightly. Is that the reason 
she thinks I bought it?

&quot;You&#39;re incorrect I was going to buy it for you anyway regardless of the 
current circumstances.&quot; Her eyes widened in surprise and she blushed 
lightly.

&quot;Do you want to wear it now though?&quot; she asked shyly, tucking a 
rebellious strand of hair behind her ear.

&quot;Of course, I bought it didn&#39;t I? I have a request though can we wear it 
on a different finger?&quot; she looked a bit sad like a child that could 
have the toy they wanted. She put the ring on my middle finger and 
replaced her own. I held her chin lightly and made her look up at me.

&quot;I don&#39;t like unofficial things, you know that. I promise you though 
that when we do go get rings for that particular finger they&#39;ll be even 
more spectacular.&quot; She hugged me quickly and whispered an ok into my 
ear. She&#39;s so easy to please.

Dragging me out of the alleyway all I could barely keep up with her 
quick pace. Well I suppose she&#39;s decided on our next destination then.

Enjoy? If you did tell me, as usual i beg you to review. ONEGAI!!

Now i understand this is short...Hell even i don&#39;t like the shortness 
but when i read the entire date through it felt way too long. Plus there 
would be too many events going on in a single chapter and it would give 
me a headache...i hate editting. However you will get the next chapter 
fairly quickly on a regular basis. their date should span 3 more 
chapters full of fluffy goodness so stick around.

Ah it feels good to be back.

Now only if i accidentally connected to the goddess helpline whilst 
dialing for a pizza that would make my day
