The wind lightly blew and the sun glowed above me. I stood over my 
latest kill, a Jotun, a disgusting beast summoned by a mad demon. Blood 
poured from its wounds as it lay for dead, on the ground. Its fangs and 
eyes were stained black, a sign that it was truly dead. With minimal 
effort I pulled my now bloody axe from its stomach and flicked all the 
blood off it with one swipe. The last beast was finally down, and the 
demon who summoned them had been apprehended. Walking away from the 
scene to allow the trainees to perform clean duties I noticed blood on 
my shoes. The strong red contrasted greatly against my immaculate white, 
how odd, I never get dirty in a fight. Then again it seemed in this 
particular fight something overtook me, perhaps sadness or some kind of 
foreign emotion? Usually all it took was one precise strike from my axe, 
but this time I hacked away mindlessly. Curse emotions, how dare they 
affect my performance.

From a distance I saw Senya flying towards me at full speed. She stopped 
hastily; her hair draped over her face as she tried to catch her breath.

&quot;What do you think you were doing!&quot; She managed to yell out.

&quot;Fulfilling the mission objective.&quot;

&quot;Yes but you used 60 of your power! This mission only required 0.2 of 
your power! What were you thinking?&quot; She looked down at me with a large 
frown. &quot;We have humans in the area!&quot; She was right, there were humans in 
the area. I could have endangered them or worse, what kind of out of 
control monster am I? I had even caused a large crater to form in the 
ground, I had done too much.

&quot;I apologise. I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot; I do really. The moment I 
voluntarily kissed Peorth something in my mind snapped. I was no longer 
me.

&quot;Lind.&quot; She swallowed &quot;you&#39;ve been doing this for the past few days. I 
think I have to report t you&quot; she said sadly, I know she didn&#39;t really 
want to, but she respects her duty even more than me.

&quot;It&#39;s ok. To release excessive powers in an unnecessary situation 
especially in a prohibited area with life forms calls for a report made 
by the superior. In the meantime I shall await the council&#39;s decision.&quot; 
With that I flew off into the portal to heaven. I knew the outcome; I 
was probably going to receive a demotion or suspension until further 
notice. It stings for my perfect record to be tarnished just because of 
a few moments carelessness.

----------

In my office I sat for once with my legs on the desk and leant into my 
chair. Who would have thought that I could be affected so much because 
of what happened with Peorth. I mean here I am with my feat up, my paper 
work messy and a pot of cup noodle in my hands, something is definitely 
wrong with me. I sighed out deeply and ran my hand through my hair. My 
actions for the past few days have been inexcusable. I endangered many 
lives and could have potentially killed many humans. I must sort this 
problem of mine out so I can return to normal and perform efficiently 
and correctly during missions.

Damn it how can one person, one action affect me so much? Ever since I 
kissed Peorth and she left the room I started acting this way. What is 
this feeling? Sadness? Regret? Did that kiss really affect her so much 
that she&#39;s now avoiding me? I thought she would understand that I was 
only doing it out of duty; what else was I to do let her stand there 
until she kissed any random person? No, even if she couldn&#39;t control 
herself I would rather she kiss me then any random person, better a 
friend than a stranger. Despite Peorth claiming that she is the goddess 
of love, in reality she&#39;s shy when it comes to signs of intimacy; I can 
understand if she feels weird to be with me. She doesn&#39;t like it when 
people show love for her when they don&#39;t really mean it.

Then something in my mind clicked, I figured out why I had been acting 
so strange. I&#39;m fearful that Peorth hates me because she thinks I simply 
kissed her without emotion. Of course, I did it out of duty, but I&#39;m not 
void of emotion, I have to say I enjoyed kissing her. Of all the people 
in my life only she can evoke such a reaction from me, perhaps this is 
what people mean by the vulnerability of love. That&#39;s right, I love her, 
sometimes in my trained mind I forget about my own feelings.

&quot;I love Peorth&quot; I whispered to myself, and immediately a wide smile 
appeared on my face and I chuckled lightly. It wasn&#39;t that hard to say 
after all, perhaps I could actually tell her. I slammed my pot noodles 
down forcefully when I realised the solution to my problem.

I&#39;m going to tell her!

Yes! Once I tell her my feelings she&#39;ll know I really meant to kiss her. 
Then everything will return to normal, and I shall be my usual stoic, 
powerful self.

&quot;ACHOO!&quot; sneezed someone. I immediately leapt out of my chair and 
resumed a defensive position. Someone sneezed rather loudly and it was 
coming from behind the curtains in the back of the room. Despite the 
curtains being already drawn, the gathered cloth was still enough to 
hide a person. Slowly I made my way towards the curtain and created a 
ball of energy in my palm. I grabbed the cloth and pulled back quickly, 
but no one was there. I could have sworn I heard someone sneeze.

Someone knocked on the door and opened. It seemed my verdict had been 
decided upon. In walked senya looking strict as ever, she was dressed in 
her Valkyrie uniform which was odd as she usually always wore her battle 
uniform, I suppose its because she had to see the council.

&quot;Hello Senya.&quot; I said and sat back down in my seat.

&quot;Lind.&quot; She said and sat down opposite me and crossed her legs neatly. 
&quot;The council has decided. You displayed and used excessive amounts of 
power when dispatching a group of Jotuns today. Humans where in the area 
and could have seen something or could have been hurt, as well as this 
three trainees were also on this mission. That is not the sort of 
behaviour we should display to them.&quot; She said and pushed her glasses 
up.

&quot;I apologise for my actions. The verdict?&quot;

&quot;The council has decided to restrict your powers. You are forbidden to 
use any form of magic for one month. Thus because of your limited 
abilities you will be placed on missions as an assistant, not as the 
leader.&quot; No powers, and I have to do Mist&#39;s bidding for a month, great. 
Lets just say when I get these rights to use magic back, I&#39;m going 
hunting.

&quot;It will be difficult, but I shall adjust.&quot;

&quot;Lind its only a month....&quot; Senya stopped abruptly because suddenly the 
rooms emergency lights turned on and the siren was on. We both looked 
out of the window to see the rest of heavens emergency lights turn on, 
red flashed everywhere. A state of emergency now? What has happened? We 
ran out into the hall and out of the building quickly rushing to the 
entrance of the Valkyrie sector. In the main building all screens had 
changed to the operations room where Urd was stating the crisis. Senya 
as the currentHead of the Valkyrie sectorquickly rushed to respond.

&quot;There is a state of emergency in heaven! Many higher level demons and 
beasts from confinement have escaped into sectors 1 &amp; 5 of heaven.&quot; Said 
Urd calmly, despite the shocked and worried faces the other operations 
goddesses had.

&quot;What happened to Elen&#39;s team? They were on duty how could they let the 
demons escape!&quot; Shouted a shocked Senya.

&quot;One of Elen&#39;s team was scratched by a Jotun claw; under its influence 
she released The Lord of terror from confinement. He has possessed The 
baron and is using his powers to release everyone else.&quot;

&quot;Damn! I&#39;m going to need several first class goddesses to catch him.&quot;

&quot;Elen&#39;s team are back on track and are intercepting a group near sector 
2.&quot; Urd was tapped on the shoulder by a worried Chronos who whispered 
something in her ear. &quot;Correction. Regions 1,2,5 and 9 have now been 
infected. They seem to be making their way to Kami-sama. The situation 
is now urgent and must be dealt with immediatly. You know what to do.&quot; 
Said Urd and quickly the screen disconnected.

Senya grabbed a mike from the main desk and shouted into it

&quot;I want Lawfer&#39;s, Lydia&#39;s and Youso&#39;s team to protect the operations 
room and Kami-sama&#39;s room!&quot; They nodded and quickly flew off with 
weapons in hand, the tales of their uniform spinning in the wind.

&quot;I want 5 teams in each infiltrated area! Chase them down! Lind&#39;s, 
Mist&#39;s and my team to sector 9. Call upon any first class when you see 
them! DISPATCH!&quot; Shouted Senya, she really is a good leader.

In formation with a captain leading the other 3 members of their team we 
all flew off to our area. I summoned my battle axe and everyone else 
followed. I knew what Senya was planning; she wanted to chase The Baron 
down herself. Of all the demons and creatures that ever wanted to 
destroy Kami or the earth, he was the closest to achieving his dream. A 
demon created from the shadows, he possesses immense amounts of power 
and isn&#39;t governed by the demon council. He became Heavens problems the 
moment he tried to overthrow the Daimakaicho but failed. Of all the 
demons The lord of terror could possess, he certainly picked a good one. 
We were definitely in for a tough fight. I grinned slightly, this is 
rather exciting.

----------

Myself, Mist and Senya had arrived in sector 9 of heaven, a usually loud 
shopping area with many gods and goddesses was now empty and quiet. 
Stalls and buildings now were empty, and the destruction and damage 
created a path for us to follow. There were crushed buildings and 
scattered pieces of wood and bricks everywhere. I hope that no one was 
hurt, the gods in this area are especially weak with little powers, but 
they should have evacuated already. Following the wreckage we eventually 
ended up in a giant square surrounded by buildings and greenery. The 
sirens were still on, but even through that the horrid sound of a foul 
beast breathing in deeply could be heard. Our three teams went into a 
triangle formation to intercept the beasts. In the centre of the square 
was a pack of 20 Fenrir like monsters; a trademark of The Baron. They 
snarled at each other and they fought with each other. My team hid 
behind a large statue of a human walking his dog. The inscription read

We are not higher beings, We are equals.

Inspiring words from Kami. As a proud Valkyrie, I promise no harm will 
befall him or anyone! I looked at Senya who was hidden by another set of 
statues and she signalled me an attack formation.

&quot;Team Lind.&quot; they looked up at me straight away &quot;Slice and dice.&quot; How I 
hate these formation names that we come up with, its so embarrassing to 
say them. Mist jumped at them first with her team following behind her, 
they leapt into the enemy&#39;s pack causing havoc. The beasts were thrown 
back and focused on Mist&#39;s team. Senya leapt forward and landed on the 
back of a monster completely impaling it with her lance. Not wanting to 
be left out of the fun I sent my team forward. The three of them, Lance, 
Alveir and Est came at a beast from three different sides and stabbed it 
with their swords. I leapt into the air and aimed carefully then with 
full force threw my axe at the beast. The earth trembled slightly and 
when the dust cleared all that was left of the monster was a black 
feather. I knew it. These beasts were not real; Heaven does not confine 
such a large pack so they must have been created.

&quot;Senya! Mist! They&#39;re only summonings!&quot; I yelled at my other two 
captains. Their eyes widened in fascination and they both grinned a 
menacing smile.

&quot;Forget formations attack at will! Let&#39;s kill these puppies!&quot; Shouted 
Mist and she spun and slashed at an attacking beast. This is training 
now, but when is the real monster going to show. I can feel it, someone 
is watching my every move and I don&#39;t like it one bit.

It didn&#39;t take long for all the beasts to be dispatched. Senya had 
gotten word from Urd, who appeared in the reflection of a water 
fountain, that all demons had been captured and beasts disposed of. But 
the Lord of terror, in The Baron&#39;s body was still free.

&quot;What about operations and Kami-sama?&quot; I heard Senya say.

&quot;We&#39;re all fine. Besides I&#39;m a bit bored up here I might join you once 
we locate our missing baron.&quot;

&quot;I want a first class not an admin worker like you.&quot; Senya wasn&#39;t being 
rude; she was just being Senya, boss of everything.

&quot;Hmph. I sent you a first class goddess already, their locator says 
they&#39;re in sector 8 and travelling fast, so don&#39;t worry. Auntie Urd here 
has your back. Now if you&#39;re nice I might come myself and help you out.&quot; 
In response, Senya simply splashed the water and Urd&#39;s image 
disappeared. Our proud and confidant leader flicked her hair back and 
held her lance beside her and yelled out our orders

&quot;Team Lind wait for the first class. My team and Mist&#39;s will disperse 
and search the area. He couldn&#39;t have gotten far everywhere else is 
quarantined off.&quot;

&quot;HAI!&quot; everyone shouted back. I watched as everyone flew off, whilst I 
waited. I usually was never one to wait up for back up, but I suppose 
Senya was taking into account the fact that I couldn&#39;t use magic. We 
waited, and waited. Still no first class. Where are they?

&quot;Lind look!&quot; Shouted Lance as he pointed up using his sword. I looked up

&quot;Peorth?&quot; I leapt into the air immediately with my axe held tightly in 
my hands. She was being chased by a giant black dragon, too large to be 
anything natural. It was the Lord of terror. Its great wide jaws opened 
and it created a giant fire ball infused with dark magic. She turned 
around quickly and summoned a barrier. Its not enough! Her shield will 
break! Curses, Peoth this isn&#39;t a summoning he&#39;s the real thing. The 
moment the dragon lauched its fireball I spun with full force and 
stabbed its stomach, hard. In pain the dragon&#39;s aim was off and the 
fireball was lauched off course.

&quot;Lind.&quot; Gasped Peorth.

&quot;This is the real thing. The Baron!&quot; I shouted back. Even distressed 
she&#39;s still so beautiful. &quot;Agh!&quot; I grunted as the dragon hit me with its 
large spiked tail. My team caught me in mid air, but my axe was still 
stuck in the belly of the beast.

&quot;The three of you go find the other teams now. Peorth and I will stall 
it.&quot; Despite being Valkyries my team was still all second class, right 
now Peorth is the greater asset. With no magic that meant no angel, and 
with no angel that meant no Golden eye. I&#39;m going to need all the help I 
can get to stall him. They flew off not before I took one of their 
swords. A weapon is a weapon, as long as I can inflict damage it will 
do.

As Peorth flew to my side the dragon morphed into a giant dark cloud. 
The cloud spread out into the shape of a man and eventually a solid form 
appeared. His hair was long and black and his giant cape hid his figure, 
he was literally a shadow. I had never seen The Baron before, not even 
in pictures, he was just that conspicuous. He was so secretive that most 
people in heaven think he&#39;s a myth, if not for Senya&#39;s constant bragging 
about capturing him all those years ago I never would have thought he 
was real. I was astonished when his face appeared, such strong chiselled 
features, and such dark eyes, he looks like my old sensei.

&quot;Lind first class goddess requesting access to demon threat 0 
confinement...That&#39;s what you said isn&#39;t is Lind? HAHAHA I&#39;m more than 
Threat 0 to you now with my new body!&quot; He bellowed out proudly, I forgot 
this isn&#39;t The Baron, this it The lord of terror.

&quot;Lord of Terror! Return to confinement immediately without protest or 
face divine punishment!&quot;

&quot;HAHAHAH! Me return to confinement? I don&#39;t think so little Lind. You 
shall be my first victim in this takeover of heaven nehhh&quot; he yelled and 
did a victory pose. I hit my forehead, this is my enemy?

&quot;Lind-san allow me the use of that weapon&quot; said Peorth. My forehead 
wrinkled in confusion, but I passed her the weapon. I suppose I don&#39;t 
really need it if this buffoon is my opponent.

&quot;Lord of Terror, there is no way you can win. You are in heavens domain 
with a vast number of gods and goddesses willing to defeat you in the 
name of Kami-sama. I shall give you until the count of five to admit 
defeat. 1!...2!...3!...4!...&quot; I gasped deeply as I felt something impale 
me. I looked down at my stomach; I had been stabbed with a sword, my 
sword. Blood, my own blood dirtied my uniform, this is new I thought 
wryly. Pain radiated from my stomach and it caused my entire body to 
ache and as I tried to move. Quickly the sword was pulled out causing me 
to gasp out again and blood spurted out. I staggered backwards and held 
my hands over the area trying desperately to apply pressure. Glancing up 
with wide eyes I saw Peorth smiling with the bloody sword in hand.

&quot;5! Little Lind! HAH!&quot; The lord of terror yelled, but my focus wasn&#39;t on 
him anymore.

Peorth, you wouldn&#39;t really do this. Please tell me you didn&#39;t do this!

&quot;Peorth...&quot; I barely managed to whisper before I fell from the skies. My 
hair, arms, and legs went limp and rose upwards as I destroyed clouds on 
the way down. With little energy and little sky left to fall through, I 
knew I had to do something, anything.

&quot;My angel, Cool Mint, come forth.&quot;
