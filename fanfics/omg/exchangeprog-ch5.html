I opened my eyes to be greeted by the bright light from the sun shining 
through the windows. I looked around, it appeared I was in the Healer&#39;s 
station. Mist probably brought me here when I fainted. I had gotten into 
the habit of overexerting myself during combat and thus kept passing 
out. I slammed my fist against the bed in frustration, I trained for 17 
hours, and I still can&#39;t summon my other angel. What am I doing wrong? 
It&#39;s evident I need power, but do I still not have enough? Rubbing my 
face with my hand to wake up more, I swung my legs over the side of the 
bed. Apart from one person asleep in the far corner of the room, I was 
the only patient; all the other beds were neat and empty. Upon hearing 
my footsteps on the tiled floor the healer in charge, an old grey haired 
man, spun around to face me. As our usual arrangement I anxiously waited 
whilst he looked at me up and down deducing if I was well enough to 
leave. Without a word he spun back to face his computer, this being the 
sign that I could leave, I quickly left.

Curse my weakness, I am a Valkyrie! I should be able to endure 17hours 
of training without fainting, it&#39;s probably those accursed noodles that 
are my downfall. I made a mental note to bring the issue up with Peorth 
the next time I saw her. Rushing into the Battle centre main hall I 
sought out my annoying white haired companion, Mist had my axe. I knew 
she had my axe because I couldn&#39;t summon it, that only ever happens when 
another goddess possesses it. Looking around at the people rushing in 
and out of the hall I realised it was hopeless to find a specific person 
in this chaos. I breathed out deeply to calm myself down so that when I 
found Mist I wouldn&#39;t destroy her, she should know better then to keep 
my axe. Suddenly I felt a surge of energy aimed at me, I quickly spun 
out of the way. The surge of energy hit into a wall with a loud bang. 
Everyone around me froze, and gawked. I calmly walked over to inspect 
the wall; it was a rose and a note. Ripping the note off I quickly 
walked away ignoring the gaping eyes at my back. Some people tried to 
follow me but they eventually gave up when I flew outside and onto a 
roof. Eagerly I took the note out from my sleeve and read it

Lind, meet me on the plat form in the skyway. Mist

Honestly if she wanted to meet me she could have gotten my attention 
using more discreet means. I mean throwing a rose infused with energy at 
me is just a bit much. What on earth is Mist up to? I jumped down from 
the roof and burnt the note in my hand. I swear if this is another one 
of her pranks I&#39;ll ruin her in front of her fanclub. The quickest way to 
the skyway was by means of flying, but although I didn&#39;t show it, I 
really didn&#39;t even have the energy to fly. So a portal it was, walking 
back into the main hall I stood into the queue for the portal. There 
were roughly 10 people in front of me, honestly what is this, 
congestion? Finally it was my turn I inputted my destination into the 
keyboard and stepped in. The portal glowed brightly and I felt myself 
being transported, it was such an odd sensation to be transported. It&#39;s 
like I&#39;m a jigsaw puzzle and I was being disassembled and reassembled 
all at once. I opened my eyes and stepped out, only that, I wasn&#39;t in 
the skyway I was in the operations room. The portal always worked. 
Thoroughly irritated at that point I stomped up the stairs to the upper 
level and straight to the large chair.&quot;

&quot;Oi Peorth What&#39;s with the portal?&quot; I said and spun the chair around 
only to be greeted by urd &quot;Urd? What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Boy you and your other half are really forgetful aren&#39;t you?&quot; She 
replied sarcastically

&quot;Other half?&quot;

&quot;Opps, forget I said anything. Anyway, the portal does work its just 
that I had a request to bring you here.&quot;

&quot;From whom?&quot;

&quot;Anonomous.&quot; She spun back round to face the computer and then pointed 
behind her. &quot;Those are for you.&quot; I followed her finger and saw a 
beautiful white box with a blue ribbon tied on a desk. As if it were a 
diseased object, I apprehensively walked up to it and shook it roughly 
with both hands.

&quot;Don&#39;t manhandle your gift&quot; Urd said without turning around.

A gift for me? This day really is too much; I&#39;m starting to get a 
headache. Carefully I opened it, first pulling the ribbon gently off, 
then I lifted off the lid slowly. My mouth dropped at the sight and I 
started to drool slightly. Individually wrapped in a thin ice casing, it 
was heaven&#39;s best chocolate, called the Glacial drop. To eat just one 
chocolate was as if all your troubles melted away and all you knew was 
the delicious taste on your tongue. Shiftily looking around I carefully 
placed the lid back on and tucked the box under my arm. Whoever had sent 
me these knows I have a sweet tooth, curse them they know my weakness.

&quot;Urd do you really not know who sent me these?&quot;

&quot;Mah I can&#39;t really remember.&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure if I entirely believed her 
after all this was Urd. Making my way to the portal yet again I was 
whisked off, hopefully to my correct destination this time.

I soon arrived at the Skyway, and carefully jumped from pillar to pillar 
making my way to the platform in the centre. I was debating in my mind 
to just have one chocolate there and then, but then my mind was stuck 
back to when I fainted. It was probably because of all these treats that 
I had that I was getting weak. I eventually decided not to eat the 
chocolates decided they were bad for me. Soon I saw Mist on the plat 
form and walked towards her

&quot;Why did you want to meet?&quot; She asked upon seeing me.

&quot;No, you wanted to meet me.&quot;

&quot;But I got a note from you.&quot; That&#39;s odd I thought; something is 
definitely askew. Whilst I pondered about the odd situation Mist hastily 
jumped at the box I was holding knowing what it was. &quot;Lind, how did you 
get these chocolates?&quot;

&quot;It was a gift from someone.&quot; I watched as she too lifted the lid 
carefully and sat down on the platform with the box. She looked at me 
with puppy eyes and I rolled my eyes at her and sighed. Deciding that 
that was a yes from me she popped a chocolate into her mouth. I watched 
annoyed that I denied myself from such delicious pleasure. I can&#39;t take 
it anymore; I just had to have one. Reaching out at the box I grabbed a 
chocolate and just as I was about to eat it Mist did the weirdest thing. 
Her lips pursed together and her whole body went straight, then she 
started to kiss the ground.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; She said and kissed the platform again. &quot;I think someone 
cursed the chocolate!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; I said and quickly dropped it. I placed a barrier around the box 
and analysed it, indeed someone had placed a kissing curse on the 
chocolate, to kiss Mist specifically. I face faulted at the thought of 
what would have happened had I eaten one.

&quot;Do something!&quot; Yelled Mist. Unfortunately curses really are not my 
speciality so I had no idea how to undo it, especially a curse as 
intricate as this one. Without trying to laugh I summoned a mirror for 
her which she accepted gratefully.

I spun around in the large swivel chair I was sitting in, I was in the 
teaching office myself, Senya, and Mist shared. It&#39;s just a large white 
office with three chairs and three desks, simple, how I like it. I&#39;m 
getting really fed of all this, on my desk was another gift. I received 
a box of chocolates everyday now, and it was getting tiresome. I had 
given up opening the chocolates and analyzing them, after all they 
always had the same pattern.

I spun around in my chair again, an old habit of mine which I do when 
I&#39;m agitated. Honestly I thought, who in their right mind would send me, 
the stoic scarily cool Valkyrie gifts of affection? And who in their 
mind would want to set me up with Mist? That is just wrong, I face 
faulted and shook my head.

The only person I want to kiss is Peo...No! I didn&#39;t just think that. I 
really can&#39;t deal with my feelings right now, especially with the bulk 
load of work I have and this stalker. I stopped spinning and faced the 
desk properly, getting a pen out I started to read my first mission 
report. God I hate reading these, the trials of being a higher up 
Valkyrie. It was the same, paragraph after paragraph about useless 
nonsense, honestly why can&#39;t she just say she dispatched of the demon 
already? Finally I reached the end of the document and signed my sigil. 
I hate paperwork, its so repetitive.

I leant back into my chair hoping that it would consume me and I could 
escape my work. The light was dimming and the room darkened slightly 
gaining a reddish hue because of the curtains. Something&#39;s askew, I 
never usually find paperwork so annoying so why now? Then I realised a 
particular someone is missing...Peorth. I miss the endless amount of 
talking she does, and the gifts she brings me every now and again, even 
her teasing god damn it...I miss Peorth. Where is she, hiding in some 
corner because she thinks she&#39;s demoted? She would even help me with my 
work sometimes, but she wasn&#39;t here.

Suddenly the door slammed open and I shot upright, scared that it was 
Senya. I hastily grabbed my pen and pretended to work. I hadn&#39;t looked 
up yet but whoever it was walked up to my desk. They grabbed the box of 
chocolates

&quot;Honestly Lind-chan, at least acknowledge me when I walk in the room.&quot; I 
looked up eagerly recognising the voice.

&quot;Peorth&quot; I exclaimed with wide eyes. She sat on the edge of my desk and 
she opened it slowly. On no! Should I tell her they&#39;re cursed? Wait a 
minute Mist&#39;s not in the room, the curse won&#39;t have effect. Ah, she 
should be fine. Slowly Peorth grabbed a chocolate and raised it to her 
mouth.

&quot;Yo! I found another gift outside&quot; shouted a happy Mist as she walked 
into the room carrying a box. By the time I realised what was happening 
Peorth had already eaten the chocolate.

NO! Peorth is definitely not going to kiss Mist! I won&#39;t allow it. I 
jumped over my desk and stood between the two.

&quot;Oi what&#39;s your problem?&quot; Mist asked confused at my actions. I motioned 
her to look at Peorth, and we both watched as her body straightened like 
a robot and her lips pursed together. She turned to look at us then 
suddenly lunged. I couldn&#39;t believe what happened next.
