<h2>Conflicts of Interest</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>It was a subdued bunch of girls the tiger stripped  saucer let out at the Amazon village.   Zhu Shu led the way, followed by the Senshi.  They looked weary and tired, but no worse for  wear, though the mood was far from jubilant.   Even Lum, when she emerged, looked slightly sad.<p>
  “I’m sorry Xi’an Chi escaped.”  Sailor Moon said for the umpteenth millionth  time to the downcast Chinese girl.<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Project Banshee finished.  That all that matter.  Zhu Shu deal with Xi’an Chi again.  Next time, he not escape.”  She sighed heavily.  “Is not Usagi fault Zhu Shu not catch Xi’an  Chi.  No need apologize.”<p>
  “No indeed, Princess.”   A still young Lo Shen said, coming up to meet them.  “It is an honor for Princess Serenity to  grace our humble village with her presence.   Be welcome, along with your guardians.”   She bowed to the Senshi, then turned to Zhu Shu, “and to you as well  Dragon’s Child.” <p>
  Zhu Shu bowed back, then kicked Usagi in the  shin.  The taller blonde jumped, then  hurriedly bowed as well.  The other girls  had already returned the courtesy.<p>
  “How’d you know I was Princess Serenity?”  Usagi asked.<p>
  “The Amazons are one of the few peoples who were not  silenced by Saturn when she rebirthed the world, Princess.  We still remember what was in truth, not the  history rewritten.”<p>
  “Saturn?”<p>
  Lo Shen raised an eyebrow, then nodded.  “Not all your guardians have been reborn yet,  Princess.”<p>
  Usagi’s eyes got round.  As the blonde girl attempted to absorb that,  Zhu Shu turned to Lum.  “Zhu Shu wish to  thank for bringing back to village.”<p>
  Lum smiled.  “I  had fun here last time.  And you don’t  call enough.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a small smile.  “Zhu Shu’s life is complicated.  Very sorry.   Should make more time for friends.”<p>
  Lum shrugged.  “Oh,  that’s okay.  I know how it is.  I have friends all over the galaxy.”  She smiled.   “Just do me a favor and cheer up.”   She gave Zhu Shu a hug.  “I gotta  get back to Tomobiki.  My little tracker  is showing that Darling is trying to sneak out again.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled.   “Have fun with beloved.”<p>
  Lum waved to all the girls as she flew back to her  saucer and it zipped away.  They all  waved back as the saucer vanished into the distance.<p>
  “So how do we get home from here?”  Usagi asked.   “I had enough difficulty getting Dad convinced we had a way home without  us getting stuck longer than a day.  If  we’re not back home by tomorrow, he’s going to let me have it.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu said there would be a helicopter come to get  us.” Rei said. “So don’t worry about it.”<p>
  “Why couldn’t we just go home?”<p>
  Zhu Shu broke in.   “Ke Lun say come back to village.”   Zhu Shu turned back to Lo Shen.   “Loremistress?” she asked in Chinese<p>
  “Yes, Child?” Lo Shen replied, in Chinese as well.<p>
  “I have spoken with my Grandfather.  He has finally told me who I am.”<p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “If I may be so forward, Empress, it’s about time Shi told you the  truth.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Please Loremistress; I have no desire to be the heir to a throne no-one  even remembers.  I am content to be a  servant.  The titles have done nothing  save make me a target of a madman, and cost Amazons their lives.”<p>
  “Whether you wish it or not Zhu Shu, you are the  Empress.  You <em>are</em> our liege.  The Amazons  swore an oath a millennia ago to be the guardians for Lin Tzu and Clan  Dragon.  We have spent three hundred  years believing we failed our oath.   You’re not going to stop being the Empress just because you wish it, any  more than we can abandon our oath to defend you.  And I do not think Scorpion’s attack on our  village was primarily directed at you.”   Lo Shen said as gently as she could.   “I know you don’t feel comfortable with this, child, but you cannot  escape your heritage.  We will do what we  can to support you, but now that you know the truth, you can no longer be  shielded by ignorance.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, her eyes lowered.  “I understand, Loremistress.  But please, my name is far more comfortable  for me to hear than a title.”<p>
  Lo Shen smiled.   “Very well.  I certainly can  sympathize.  You have no idea how tired I  get of being addressed as Loremistress.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed.   “My apologies, Lo Shen.”<p>
  “None needed, Zhu Shu.   However, did I hear you mention the name Xi’an Chi just now?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “He is the leader of Clan Scorpion.   This much I learned from our travels to Lan Tao.”<p>
  “I see.  We  shall discuss this later, Empress.  For  now, please come to speak with the Elders.   They have been waiting to hear your news since Har Spra advised us of  your coming.”<p>
  “So can we know what you two are talking about?”  Usagi complained.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Zhu Shu and Lo Shen needed settle something.  Will need to advise elders of what occur in Hong Kong.”<p>
  “Yes.  The  report Har Spra sent was… sketchy at best.” Lo Shen said in accent free  Japanese. “She kept bemoaning the fact she’d finally found a male who could  best her, and he was unavailable.  If I  never hear the name Chan again…”  Lo Shen  sighed.  “Of course, living in China, that  shall be unavoidable.”  She turned to  Usagi.  “And, she failed to mention the  Princess.”  She gave the odangoed blonde  an amused look.  “Though I am curious as  to how you felt being at a festival held to mourn the fall of your previous  self and Prince Endymion.”<p>
  Usagi shrugged.   “Kinda sad, I guess.  It was  strange.”  <p>
  The other Senshi nodded.  Rei stepped up next to Zhu Shu.  “Are you okay?  You look like she gave you bad news.” she  asked quietly.<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “No.   Remind Zhu Shu of things she wish not necessary.”<p>
  “Oh.  Pushing  you to find a husband?”<p>
  “Only part.   Usagi not only person stuck with title not want.”<p>
  “Oh.  It was  about you being the empress, huh?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Yes.  Xi’an Chi wishes to capture  because is heir of Lin Tzu.  If Zhu Shu  no empress, she maybe be safer.”  She  shrugged.  “Zhu Shu think curse less  trouble.”<p>
  Rei nodded.  “I  guess.  I can’t say Usagi’s really gotten  much use out of being a princess either, other than it making her a target for  Beryl.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled.   “Zhu Shu not feel alone then.”<p>
  Rei laughed softly as they turned to follow Lo Shen to  the Elders hall.<p>
  Inside the large hut, they found the Amazon elders  waiting.  Zhu Shu bowed to Ke Lun as she  entered then guided the Senshi to seats along the wall.  <p>
  “Zhu Shu must need tell elders what happen.” she  explained to the curious girls.   “Forgive, but will be easier to speak Chinese.”   <p>
  They nodded, watching as she stepped before the  elders’ table.<p>
  “Greetings Zhu Shu,” Ke Lun started.  “Lo Shen informs me that Shi has finally told  you your true heritage.”<p>
  “Yes, Great-Grandmother.  He has told me of the history of Clan Dragon  and his role in the events that led to the fall of our stronghold.  I know about Clove of the Musk, and the  events that led to his hiding.”  She  paused.  “I do not know if you know why  my Grandfather hid himself”<p>
  Ke Lun shook her head.   “Shi has never explained.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “According to my Grandfather, the wizard Xi’an Chi was behind the  aggression the Musk showed.  He promised  Clove she would have Shi following the destruction of our clan.  When my Grandfather escaped, Xi’an Chi  attempted to capture him, and Clove gave her life to allow him to escape,  realizing Xi’an Chi had used her.”  She  paused and looked Ke Lun in the eyes.  “I  am cursed with her form, Great-Grandmother.   I know you could not help but to have known that.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Yes.  I did not know what you  truly knew of your history, Grand-daughter.   I did not wish to burden you if you were unaware of the past.”<p>
  The little Chinese girl nodded.  “I understand, Great-Grandmother.”<p>
  “What of the events in Hong Kong?”<p>
  “There is not much I can say.  Xi’an Chi was working with a group of  Americans to create weapons.  With the  aid of the Senshi and the Heir of Clow Reed, as well as that of an American  archeologist named Chan and his niece Jade, we ended the experiments they were  performing on a young woman named Alice and destroyed the base.  Regretfully, the leaders escaped.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “I see.  That is a far cry from a  ‘scouting mission’, young lady.  I  believe you promised to avoid danger, did you not?”<p>
  Zhu Shu hung her head.   “I did, Warleader.  I did not seek  out danger, but it found me anyway.”<p>
  “I see.  You are  fortunate indeed I have already decided to only bring Lung-Lung and Ling-Ling  with me to Japan.  Were you not as formidable a warrior as you  are, Empress, I would have a full contingent of warriors follow you around.”<p>
  Usagi saw Zhu Shu’s face pale and leaned over to  Rei.  “What are they saying?”<p>
  Rei shrugged.   “I don’t know.  I don’t speak  Chinese.”<p>
  Zhu Shu meanwhile had recovered from the thought of  being surrounded by a horde of Amazons at all times and looked at Ke Lun.  “I thank you for your praise,  Great-Grandmother.  And for your allowing  me the freedom to defend myself.”<p>
  “You have earned it Zhu Shu, at least until such a  time as I deem greater protection is warranted.   I will not allow the heir to the empire to come to harm.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “I understand, Great-Grandmother.   Yet I do ask for as much leniency in this as you are willing to give.”<p>
  Lo Shen laughed.   “She’s already given you far more leniency than some on this council  feel she should, child.  Yet I agree with  her that keeping you on a light leash is best.   For all that you are our Empress, you are still young, and have much of  life to learn about.  Experience is  always the best teacher.  Still, we will  all rest easier knowing that Ke Lun will be near to your hand, as will our  champion.  I will also keep in touch  occasionally.  We do not seek to  interfere in your life Zhu Shu, but we will not allow serious harm to come to  you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu bowed again.   “I understand, revered Elders.  I  will not resist you in this unless I feel it is overly restrictive.”<p>
  “Fair enough, Zhu Shu.   Thank you for not putting us in a position where we would feel a need to  disobey your orders to keep our oaths to your clan.  However, knowing now that Xi’an Chi is the  wizard behind our recent misfortunes, be aware we may have to revise these  measures, My Empress. Xi’an Chi is the brother of Song Lin Tzu, and a most  powerful adversary. While I believe you may one day exceed him in skill and  power, at present he is far beyond you, and ancient in his evil.  We have for most of a millennium believed him  safely dead during the Silencing.  To  know that he was behind Clan Dragon’s fall answers many mysteries behind those  events.”  She turned to Ke Lun.  “Will you approve of my wish to train any of  our new tribe members who show talent as mages now, Ke Lun?”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Very well, Lo Shen.  I withdraw  my objections to your plan.  As badly as  we need warriors, if Xi’an Chi should attack us directly, we will need  magecraft far more.  Let your apprentices  train as many as can be found.”<p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “Xi’an Chi ever was a cautious individual, Ke Lun.  He will never attack in person where he can  manipulate others to attack.  If he has  been defeated in Hong Kong, it will be some time before he can establish a new  base of operations, and with the number of men we eradicated, the Scorpion tong  will take months to rebuild.  We should  have several months to prepare before then.   I will set my students to combing the records, and see what other  evidence of his hand in our past affairs they can find.  We will not be so vulnerable now that we know  he yet lives.” She looked to the other elders and switched to Japanese.  “However, for now Zhu Shu is safe and well  protected, so I believe this matter is settled?”<p>
  The other elders nodded.  Ke Lun cracked an almost imperceptible  smile.  “Good.”  She added, also in Japanese.  “Now, we have other matters to settle,  including welcoming our esteemed…”  She  broke off as her ears twitched.  “Ah… but  first, we have a new arrival.”  She  turned to the Senshi.  “I apologize  Princess Serenity, but I fear we have a tribal matter that must be dealt with  immediately.  I must beg your continued  indulgence and patience.  Once we have  this settled, we will have a dinner to prepare in your honor.  Our esteemed liege neglected to inform us you  were returning with her, or we would have had a feast already prepared.  It has been a millennium since the Moon Kingdom  has been our guests.”<p>
  Usagi blinked until Rei nudged her.  “Tell her thank you, dummy!”<p>
  “Oh, um… Thank you and we don’t mind waiting for you  to finish your… um… tribal business.”   Usagi managed.<p>
  The sounds that Ke Lun’s ears had picked up were  audible now to everyone, proving to be the roar of a plane.  It took several minutes as the tilt-rotor  landed, then Tao-Ching was escorted in by an Amazon bearing a spear with an  enormous blade.  She bowed to the elders.<p>
  “I have returned with my son as you requested, Lo Shen.  He submitted without protest.”<p>
  “Thank you Rin Se.”   Ke Lun said.  She turned to Lo  Shen.  “Before the accused is tried, I  wish to make a statement.”<p>
  “That is your right, Warleader.  It may have no bearing on my decision as  Loremaster.”<p>
  “Of course not.   Your job is to interpret the Law, as mine is to enforce it if need  be.  I wish merely to remind the  Loremistress that Tao-Ching nearly died defending my Great Grand-daughter against  the Musk.  Herb owed a blood-debt to  him.”<p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “I have taken that into consideration, Ke Lun.”  She turned to Tao-Ching.  “So, I’m in a bit of a quandary here,  Tao-Ching.  You disobeyed a direct order  to report Herb’s whereabouts when you found him, choosing instead to take him  on by yourself.  In so doing, you jeopardized  our quest to retrieve the <em>Chisuitton</em>.  While you apparently succeeded in obtaining  the<em> Kaisufuu</em>, you succeeded only by  luck, and we suspect, by ambushing Herb.   Despite your services to the tribe in the past Tao-Ching, your actions  were reckless in the extreme and endangered our entire tribe.  What have you to say?”<p>
  “I have no defense, Loremistress, save that Herb owed  me a debt of honor.  I took what steps I  saw as necessary to ensure the <em>Kaisufuu</em> was returned to the Joketsuzoku, and that Herb was repaid for the debts he owed  to myself and the tribe.”<p>
  “You took this on yourself?  Why?”<p>
  Tao-Ching sighed.   “With all due respect, elder.  I  had no time to do anything else.  Those I  had hired to detain Herb were killed.  I  went armed to deal with Herb, expecting to have him delivered unconscious and  in chains, only to find him the only living person who left the boat.”<p>
  “You should have advised us before making such  arrangements, Tao-Ching.  I could have  advised you that Herb would have overcome any common warriors.”<p>
  “She did not overcome <em>me</em>, elder.  I retrieved the  bucket and ladle, and the kettle.”<p>
  Lo Shen looked at Tao-Ching for a long uncomfortable  moment.  Finally, as the silence grew  oppressive, Lo Shen spoke again.  <p>
  “It is only because you were indeed successful that I  am willing to be lenient in sentencing you, Tao-Ching, but I cannot allow you  to go unpunished.  You were raised an  Amazon, and as such, you are governed by our laws.  I am tolerant of the fact that you are truly  Japanese, Tao-Ching, but I cannot allow you to wholly forget your upbringing.”<p>
  She stood and stepped around the table to look  Tao-Ching in the eyes.  “Your actions  reflect your attitude, Tao-Ching.  You  are arrogant.”  <p>
  She motioned to an Amazon who stood to the side, and  she brought forward a long chest and laid it on the table next to Lo Shen.  The Loremistress placed a hand on the chest.<p>
  “You need to learn that there are some things more  important than simple success.  Winning  at all costs is sometimes worse than losing when victory comes without  honor.  I fear that there may yet be  repercussions to your actions we will all regret, but only time will tell.  You have proven you can be a <em>fighter</em>, Tao-Ching, but the soul of a <em>warrior</em> requires an understanding of  honor that I am not certain you possess.”<p>
  She opened the chest to reveal seven katanas.  “This is your punishment, your quest, your  lesson.  Among the treasures recovered  from the Musk we found these blades.   They are ancient, marked by family crests.  You are charged with their return to the  families they were stolen from.  Return <em>their</em> honor and perhaps you will find  your own.”<p>
  Tao-Ching bowed.   “I understand, Loremaster.  I will  obey.”<p>
  Usagi looked puzzled.   She whispered to Rei.  “That  doesn’t sound like much of a punishment.”<p>
  Rei looked at her in surprise.  “Are you mad?   Don’t you have any idea how impossible that’s going to be?  Finding the families those blades belong  to?  Between the War and the Shogunate,  many samurai families don’t even exist any more!”<p>
  “Oh.”<p>
  “And if those are the family blades, their loss would  have destroyed the family’s honor.  If  any of them survived that disgrace, they’d have been pariah.  The odds he can even finish this test in a  lifetime are slim.”<p>
  “Then why give it to him?”<p>
  “Test remind Tao-Ching of own honor.  Test not intended to be completed.” Zhu Shu  supplied.<p>
  Usagi shrugged.   “Okay, I guess.  Sounds silly to  me.”<p>
  “I think it’s a rather fitting punishment.”  Makoto said.   “Martial Artists have a responsibility to uphold their own honor and  respect the honor of those they fight.   Sounds to me like Tao-Ching didn’t fight fair.”<p>
  Minako shrugged.   “I don’t know.  He seems nice  enough to me, and really cute and muscular.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “No.   Hentai boy already claimed by Nabiki.  No chase.”<p>
  They all blinked.   “Hentai boy?”<p>
  “Tao-Ching very appreciative of females.  Fewer clothes better.”  Zhu Shu sniffed.<p>
  Lo Shen’s ears twitched.  “What was that, Empress?”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked as Tao-Ching looked at Zhu Shu and  paled.  “Empress?”<p>
  Lo Shen smiled.   “Yes.  Empress.  Song Zhu Shu is the heir to the true Song  Dynasty and your liege as an Amazon.  Did  I hear her correctly?  That you have  treated our Empress improperly?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Tao-Ching has only expressed his opinion  that I am attractive, mostly.  While that  opinion has been expressed several times while I have been in a more or less  unclothed state, he’s never done more than comment or look.”  Zhu Shu told Lo Shen in Chinese.  “He has never laid hands on me.”<p>
  That didn’t stop Rin-Se from hitting Tao-Ching in the  head with her guan dao.  “Son!  I taught you better than that!”<p>
  Tao-Ching growled.   “Yes, Mother.  It’s a bad habit I  picked up in the JSDF.  Most male  soldiers are perverts, because they get denied access to females for so  long.”  He gave his mother a look.  “And I grew up in a village where I was  surrounded by beautiful women every day.   I’ve developed a taste for having them around.”<p>
  “Please, I’m fine with him.  He’s crude, but tolerable.”  Zhu Shu said.<p>
  Lo Shen gave the still pale Tao-Ching a look.  “Very well.   Your Empress is magnanimous.”  The  twinkle in her eye told Zhu Shu she was rather amused.<p>
  Turning back to the girls, she bowed.  “That concludes our official business.  We certainly wish to show you proper hospitality,  Princess Serenity.  If I may escort you,  we have a dwelling prepared for you to refresh yourselves as dinner is  prepared.”<p>
  She gathered up the Senshi and gently herded them out  as Ke Lun motioned Zhu Shu to stay.  As  the Loremistress left, Ke Lun gave Zhu Shu a brilliant smile.<p>
  “Lo Shen wanted to be the one to do this, but I  over-ruled her based on our relationship, Grand-Daughter.  We have catalogued the treasures of the Musk  this last week, and we found some things that need to be returned to you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “But I have never met the Musk before.   They have stolen nothing from me.”<p>
  “Three hundred years ago, they stole your heritage,  Zhu Shu.”  She turned to the guard who  had brought Lo Shen the swords.  “Bring  it in, please.”<p>
  Every person in the hall was grinning as Zhu Shu  blinked in confusion.  The guard opened  the large door she had been guarding and stepped inside, reappearing a few  minutes later bearing a long pole with a golden banner on it.  Zhu Shu’s breath caught as the emblem captured  the light and the Imperial Song Dragon glared at her.<p>
  Behind the banner, four more guards walked in bearing  a sedan chair, also carved with Clan Dragon’s crest and covered with gold  inlays.  More guards followed, each  bearing in additional treasures, all adorned with the Dragon.  Then a final package was handed to Ke Lun,  who brought it to Zhu Shu.<p>
  “These are the treasures of the Dragon.  It is our honor to return them to their  rightful place with the Dragon’s Child.”   She unwrapped the silk covering the bundle she was carrying and offered  it to Zhu Shu.  “This, I am especially  proud to return, since it was originally my gift.”<p>
  Zhu Shu unfolded the cloth to find a Mandarin long  dress of an incredibly fine silk.  The  crimson fabric had been woven as a single piece and adorned with small Dragon  mandalas made of tiny jewel beads.  The  hem was pure gold thread so fine it appeared nearly liquid, and the material  was incredibly soft.<p>
  “I crafted this for Mu for her wedding dress.  I had feared it destroyed forever with the  fall of the Clan.  Now, it can serve for  you.  The silk is from a rare species of  silkworm that creates nearly unbreakable thread.  It will stretch to fit regardless of whether  you are in your true form or cursed.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “It’s beautiful.”<p>
  “I look forward to your wearing it on your wedding  day.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed and reached behind her back to pull  out her herb case.  She opened it and  lifted the trays out to reveal a small panel, which she lifted.  Then she folded the dress carefully and laid  it in the secure space.  Re-closing the  case she smiled at Ke Lun.  “I shall keep  it safe for that day, Great Grandmother.”<p>
  Ke Lun then led her on a tour of the items, explaining  their history and leaving Zhu Shu breathless with wonder.  She had never imagined so much opulence.<p>
  “Shouldn’t this all go to Grandfather?” she finally  asked Ke Lun.<p>
  “Shi did not wish to see it.  Too many painful memories.  He said to keep it safe for you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, running her hands over a beautifully crafted  tea set.  “Yes.  Please, Great Grandmother.  I have no idea what to do with any of  this.  Please keep it safe for me.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “There are other treasures as well.   The Musk stole from more than just Clan Dragon.  There is one I especially set aside.  I intend it for Akane, but I think perhaps it  will mean more coming from you.”  She  lifted the cloth over one last item.<p>
  Zhu Shu stared for a long moment before hugging Ke Lun  in joy.  “They’re perfect!  Thank you so much Great Grandmother.  I can’t wait to get home and give them to  her!”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The dinner the Amazons threw for the girls was  entertaining, and was a welcome break from the aggravations of their recent  adventure.  Zhu Shu smiled and danced  along with the girls, glad most of the Amazons seemed unaware of her title, or  at least, uncaring.<p>
  The flight back to Japan in Tao-Ching’s plane was  uneventful, the girls spending most of the flight looking out the windows.  Stepping out of the tilt-rotor at Tokyo airport, Tao-Ching  smiled.  “Good to be home.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Zhu Shu feel same.  Village not  seem home any more.”<p>
  “Your heart’s here.”   Ke Lun said as she hopped over on her stick, once more her normal  self.  “It’s only natural that you feel  more comfortable here.”<p>
  The unloading went uneventfully, and they waved the  girls away in a taxi as Tao-Ching was trying to step into the drivers seat of  the Humvee.  Ke Lun waved him into the  back, making Shan Pu’s father drive instead.   Zhu Shu had just met the small, wiry man, Gel, but she could see where  Shan Pu had inherited her cheerful nature from.<p>
  They pulled up at the Tendos to let Zhu Shu out before  heading off to the restaurant Ke Lun had bought, leaving her at the path with  the single large crate she had brought back.   As she looked up at the Tendo house, she blinked away a tear.  Visiting her home village had illustrated  where she really felt home was any more.<p>
  As she started up the walk to let Kasumi know she was  home, it being a school day, she stopped when a small pink and purple kitten  pounced on her from the roof.  She smiled  as Shan Pu nuzzled her face.  “Zhu Shu  happy see sister too.” she said as Kasumi was opening the door.<p>
  “Oh my.  You  know?”  Kasumi asked.<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “Know?”<p>
  “That that’s Shan Pu.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave the kitten a look, then blinked,  remembering Ke Lun’s statement that Shan Pu was helping Ranma overcome his fear  of cats.<p>
  “Akane and Ranma not know?”<p>
  Shan Pu shook her head.<p>
  “Akane’s calling her China.  She thinks she’s just a smart cat.”<p>
  Zhu Shu rubbed her temples.  “Who tell you do this?” she asked the kitten.<p>
  “Apparently, Ke Lun told her to give this a try.”  Kasumi said.<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Hope Great-Grandmother know what do.   Zhu Shu not sure is best course.   Akane not like be fooled.”<p>
  Shan Pu looked forlorn.<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Let get bath and you tell Zhu Shu what happen so far.”<p>
  Kasumi looked at her crate.  “Are we bringing that in?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled.   “Zhu Shu not.  Cannot lift.  Was hoping Panda man bring in.”<p>
  Kasumi smiled.   “Of course.  I’ll bring you a tea  set.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“I’m doing my best not to spy, Zhu Shu.  I’m just being around her when she’s  here.  And trying to give Ranma lots of  small doses of kitty me.”  Shan Pu said  as they shared the tub.<p>
  “I understand.”   Zhu Shu replied.  “I just am  worried.  Akane is much mellower than she  used to be, but she was extremely upset with me when I didn’t tell her about  you.”<p>
  Shan Pu pouted.   “All I want to do is get her to love me, and Ranma not to run whenever I  come into a room.”<p>
  “I know.  I’m  sorry I wasn’t here to help much.”<p>
  “You had your own life to deal with, Zhu Shu.  You can’t always help me out.  Besides, I’m the Champion of the Joketsuzoku;  I should be able to do this on my own.”   Shan Pu groused.<p>
  Zhu Shu splashed her.   “Silly.  Being a good warrior  doesn’t always make you good at the ways of love.  Particularly with these two.  Give it time.   Akane takes forever to figure out her heart because she so seldom  listens to it.  Ranma ignores his because  he doesn’t understand it.  And you are <em>all</em> way too competitive.  The way of hearts is not a challenge  match.  If you compete with each other,  there are only losers.”<p>
  “Gods, Zhu Shu.   Why won’t you just accept all of our offers of marriage?  You could make this mess work.  It’s so tangled I don’t even think my wish is  going to come true, whatever Urd does.”<p>
  “Humm?”  Zhu Shu  looked at her.  “Wish?”<p>
  Shan Pu laughed.   “Yes.  When I was looking for  Ranma, I ran across a drunk goddess.  She  granted me a wish, and has been trying to fulfill it ever since.  She said she arraigned for the voodoo priest  to seal up the demon master, and called in Great Grandmother to witness  it.  She’s been trying to help out, but  she’s not very good at it, I don’t think.”<p>
  “What did you wish for?”<p>
  “For everything to work out for us.”<p>
  “Were those your exact words?”<p>
  “No.  But I  wanted to make sure that if I wished that my quest for Ranma worked out, I  didn’t want it be at your expense, so I included everybody involved.  Not that I really expected the wish to be  granted, but…”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “Well, that explains some of the coincidences.  I wonder what she’s up to now.”<p>
  The door slid open to admit Kasumi with a tea  tray.  “I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to  listen but I did hear you as I came in.   You said a goddess was involved in giving you a wish?”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded.<p>
  Kasumi looked at Zhu Shu.  “Rei said a demon came to you and told you  where to find Ranma?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, then looked at Shan Pu.  “I wonder if they’re connected?”<p>
  “Urd did come in a few times complaining about someone  named Mara.”  Shan Pu said, then did a  double take at Kasumi.  “You’re speaking  Mandarin?”<p>
  Kasumi blushed.   “Well, Zhu Shu has been learning Japanese.  I did take Mandarin in school, so I went to  the library and got a couple of learning programs and I’ve been teaching  myself.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   Kasumi’s accent was so slight she’d not even realized she wasn’t  speaking Japanese, and in retrospect, she could recall a few times Kasumi had  said something in Mandarin and she’d never noticed.<p>
  She stuck out her tongue. “You make me jealous.  I’m lousy with languages.  I know a lot of vocabulary words, but I’m  lousy with sentence structure in Japanese.   My English is a joke, and my Tibetan is embarrassing.  I’m not even all that good at Cantonese.”<p>
  Kasumi laughed.   “I don’t know what to say, dear.   I’m fluent in English, French and now Mandarin.”<p>
  Shan Pu and Zhu Shu both splashed her.  Kasumi laughed.  “I figured it would be easier for you.  I know you’re both working on your Japanese,  and Akane now understands Mandarin since she got it from Zhu Shu, though Zhu  Shu’s lost the Japanese she learned from Akane…”  Kasumi stopped.  “I wonder if all of this is connected.”<p>
  The two girls in the tub blinked.  “Huh?”<p>
  “Shan Pu made a wish, and suddenly, Zhu Shu is visited  by a demon who tells her where Ranma is.”   Kasumi explained as she set on the side of the tub.  “And you said nothing like the exchange you  had with Akane happened when you learned from Sarhia?”  <p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. <p>
  “I remember Ranma said that Sandal asked about magic  surrounding the dojo during that night.   I wonder if the reason you two merged was due to Shan Pu’s goddess?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “That would explain a lot.”<p>
  Shan Pu blinked at Zhu Shu.  “You merged chi with my Ai Ren?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked abashed.  “Not intentionally.”<p>
  Shan Pu smiled.   “So that’s how Akane knew the Song   School.”<p>
  “And the Dance of Shiva.”  Zhu Shu noted.  “She learned all my <em>skills</em>, and I mainly got her <em>emotions</em>.  After I died, I seem to have lost most of  it.”<p>
  Shan Pu frowned.   “I still wish I had been there.  I  could have kept you from dying.”<p>
  “I had to merge all the power the Senshi could throw  my way and every last bit of my own chi to kill that thing, Shan Pu.  I wasn’t planning on dying, but I couldn’t  control my fall.”<p>
  “I could have caught you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her sister a peck on the cheek.  “Of course you could have.”<p>
  The sound of the front door opening caught their  attentions.  “Kasumi!  We’re home!” Akane’s voice came from the  front of the house.<p>
  Shan Pu looked at the bucket of cold water, then  smiled mischievously.  “Great Grandmother  came with you, right?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  Shan Pu smiled wider and launched herself out of the  tub and out of the room.  Kasumi and Zhu  Shu listened as she bounded down the hall with a cry of “Ai Rens!”<p>
  There was a surprised cry of “Shan Pu!” then a crash.<p>
  Kasumi smiled.   “She’s been pouncing Akane everyday when she comes home.  Sound’s like she just did it as herself.”<p>
  Zhu Shu laughed.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>They found Akane in the foyer drying off after a hug  from a very smug, wet, naked Amazon.   Ranma was snickering from the railing of the stairs, where he’d escaped  a similar fate, but he lost his balance in surprise when Zhu Shu came down the  hall in a towel.<p>
  “Zhu Shu!   You’re back!” Akane exclaimed when she noticed the diminutive Chinese  girl.<p>
  “Yes.  Return  with Tao-Ching and Ke Lun.”<p>
  “Cool.  Nabiki  will be happy to hear her fiancé’s back.”   Akane said with a smile<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “Nabiki engaged?”<p>
  “Yeah. Short story.   Dad caught her trying to make out with him in the front yard, so he  engaged them.”<p>
  “There’s more to it than that, dear.  We were having a bit of a problem with  hyperactive sex drives.  Nabiki was  extremely frustrated.”<p>
  “Ai Ren not bunny girl any more.”  Shan Pu added.<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes widened.  “Being rabbit make want sex?”<p>
  Kasumi smiled.   “Extremely.”<p>
  “AND ZHU SHU NOT HERE?”  <p>
  Everybody laughed at the forlorn note she put into her  voice.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu spent the next hour with Akane, Ranma and Shan  Pu catching up on what had happened.  She  let Ranma and Akane think Shan Pu had arrived with her and Ke Lun, but finally,  Kasumi called to let them know dinner was ready.  <p>
  After dinner, Zhu Shu rose to stand by the big crate  she’d had Genma lug in and waited for everybody’s attention.<p>
  “Zhu Shu brings gifts from China.  Many things discovered in Musk  fortress.”  She unlocked the catches and  opened the lid.<p>
  “First, for aid in defending village, Amazons share  spoils.”  She struggled to pick up a  large chest, finally looking pleadingly at Genma.  He stood and hefted the chest out, grunting  with the weight, and set it down on the floor.   Zhu Shu knelt and unlocked it as well.   As she lifted the lid, everyone gasped.<p>
  The chest was filled with large gold coins.  Nabiki blinked in shock.  “Do you have any idea how much that is?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Did not count.”<p>
  Nabiki blinked several times, her eyes not moving.<p>
  Zhu Shu went back to the crate.  “Zhu Shu also bring several treasures as  gifts.”  She brought out a finely  embroidered silk shirt.  “Clan Dragon  recover many things from Musk.  This for  soldier of high rank.”  <p>
  She handed the shirt to Ranma, who shook out the  midnight blue silk to admire the gold and scarlet dragon.  “It’s beautiful.”  he said.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Ranma need nice clothes wear on date.”   She tossed him a pair of matching pants and shoes, as well as a red sash  belt.  “Now have no excuse.”<p>
  Ranma sighed as everyone gave him a significant  look.  “Alright already!”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled as she handed a package to Kasumi.  “These for you.”<p>
  Kasumi unrolled the bundle to find a set of gold  handled kitchen knives.  “Oh my!”<p>
  “Very sharp.   Amazon smiths say very old too.”<p>
  Kasumi nodded and smiled.  “Thank you, these are wonderful.”<p>
  The next item was an abacus carved from a dark wood  and inlaid with gold and silver dragons.   The beads were various shades of jade.   Zhu Shu handed it to Nabiki.   “This for you.”<p>
  Nabiki took it and smiled as well.  “An antique worth a small fortune.  I shall have to find a safe place for this.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded and handed the next item to Soun.  “For both fathers Zhu Shu has in Japan.”<p>
  Genma peeked over Soun’s shoulder as he lifted the lid  to reveal an ornate antique Go board made of jade, with ivory and jet  stones.  They both looked at her with  tears of joy.  “We will treasure this  forever!”<p>
  The next item she took out was a set of jeweled gold  and silver combs that she handed to Shan Pu.   “For use on dates with Ai Rens.”<p>
  Shan Pu smiled and nodded happily.<p>
  Zhu Shu gave a long slow smile to Akane.  “Zhu Shu not forget Akane.”  She reached into the crate and pulled out a  long case of carved teak.  “Zhu Shu save  for last.”<p>
  She placed the case on the table in front of her and  pointed out two carvings.  “To open must  press here.”  She touched the two  together and there was a faint click.     She lifted the lid towards Akane.<p>
  Akane gasped.   “Oh my.”  she said faintly in  imitation of Kasumi.  Hesitantly, she  reached out, hardly daring to blink lest the vision in the case vanished.  Her touch confirming its reality, she lifted  the twin objects from the case to display them for everyone.<p>
  The twin Song broadswords were nearly as ancient as  Zhu Shu’s; the blades still mirror bright and razor sharp.  Etched into the sides of the blades were  matched tigers in mid spring.  The  circular guards were also carved into tigers curled around the blade.  The hardwood hafts were of an orange and  black wood, ending in carved gold tiger’s head pommels, their roaring mouths  forming the rings to which long orange and black striped ribbons were  attached.  Akane stood and took them to  the small wooden deck just outside the dining room and took a stance, flowing  into a twirling form that caused the swords to sing merrily.  Akane beamed.  <p>
  “How ever can I repay you for this?”  <p>
  Zhu Shu smiled and in Chinese replied.  “There was never a need to repay me,  Akane.  If anyone deserved those swords,  it was you.  I do not know their age or  history, but they were crafted by a master.   And like my blades, they were crafted for a blood bond.”<p>
  Akane blinked.   “You are linked to your swords?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “As you must be to these if you wish to fully use the Song School.  Only by joining with the blade may the full  power of your chi be unleashed.  The  blades will become a conduit that will not resist your will.  Once linked, you will be bound to these  blades for life.”<p>
  Akane looked down at the swords.  “The Dragon and the Tiger.”  she murmured softly.  Looking up she smiled.  “Tell me what to do.”<p>
  You must anoint them with your blood and chi.”  She held up her palm to show the faint  crescent mark in her palm.  “It doesn’t  require much.”<p>
  Akane nodded.   Stepping up to the table, she laid the blades in the box and held out  her palms.  Shan Pu produced a small  throwing dart and looked at Zhu Shu.  At  her nod, she stepped forward and as gently as she could cut two small crescents  on Akane’s palms.  Akane reached down and  grasped the blades, channeling chi into her blood as it touched the hilts.  A slow wave of gold fire burned along the  blades as the tigers seemed to spring to life and roar.  As the fire encompassed the entire blade,  Akane gasped.<p>
  “I can feel them.   Like extensions of my body.”  <p>
  The ribbons unfurled themselves and began to make slow  undulations despite the absence of wind or movement of the blades, lashing  almost like the slow wave of a tiger’s tail.<p>
  Setting the blades back down, Akane looked down at her  hands and the healed crescents.  Shaking  her head, she reached behind her back and pulled out her practice swords,  handing them to Shan Pu, then took her new ones and put them away.<p>
  Looking at Zhu Shu again, she smiled.  “Thank you.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After dinner, Shan Pu “went home” and China put in  her appearance, earning a fuss from Akane as a lazy kitty who’d probably been  sleeping in some warm corner until the sun set.   China  just gave her a cool look, as if to say “I was doing no such thing” before  confiscating Akane’s lap.   Ranma set  behind Akane, doing fine so long as he couldn’t actually see the kitten.<p>
  While Soun and Genma broke in the new Go board, Zhu  Shu filled everybody in on her visit to Hong Kong,  and dragged every last detail about the last week out of the Tendo girls.  She also answered the mystery of where  Kodachi had vanished to, informing them that the obsessive martial gymnast had  tracked her to Hong Kong in an attempt to “defeat  the Chinese demon who had dared lay hands on her goddess.”  This news made Akane wince.<p>
  Zhu Shu also told them of the meeting Tao-Ching had  had with the elders and the quest he’d been put on.  Nabiki sighed in relief when Zhu Shu gave  them the news.<p>
  All in all, the night went quietly, a far cry from  what awaited tomorrow.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The next morning began quietly enough, China sneaking  away after breakfast so that Shan Pu could be waiting outside to join them for  her first day at school.  Even the walk  to school was uneventful, for once no-one splashing anyone, nor was anyone  waiting to attack at the school.<p>
  Indeed, nothing at all unusual, strange or out of the  ordinary occurred until school began.   That was when the handsome new student was escorted into Ranma and  Akane’s homeroom by the vice principal.   Ranma blinked as most of the girls sighed happily.  There was something about the boy that struck  a familiar cord in his memory.<p>
  Then, the teacher announced his name.<p>
  “Let’s all give a big welcome to Ukyo Kuonji.”<p>
  Ranma straightened like a shot.  “Uc-Chan?”<p>
  The new guy looked at Ranma and smiled a rather cold  smile.  “So you do remember me, huh?  I certainly remember you, Ranma.”<p>
  “Yeah, I remember you. Okonomiyaki Uc-chan! We used to  be best friends.”<p>
  “Really?  That’s  why you ran away?”  The smile grew even  colder.  “I’ve spent years hunting you,  all so I could give you this!”<p>
  A small round object flew from his hand towards  Ranma’s face.  He caught it and looked,  noting it was an okonomiyaki.  Spelled out  in sauce on the pizza was a challenge.   He blinked.<p>
  “You’re challenging me?”  He looked at the cold stare Ukyo was giving  him and shrugged.  “Fine.  When and where.”<p>
  “After school, in the athletic field.  I want everyone to have a nice view of me  beating the tar out of you.”<p>
  Ranma shrugged again.   “Okay.”  He ate the  okonomiyaki.  “Heh.  Just as good as I remember.”<p>
  The teacher looked between the two boys.  “That settled?  Good, take your seat.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“You really should have gone to school today, Usagi.”  Mamoru said as the boat pulled up to the  dock.  “Not that I’m not enjoying a day  with you, but you’ve already missed a week.”<p>
  “A week without you.   I just couldn’t stand it.”<p>
  Mamoru smiled.   “Silly.  You called me almost  every day.”  He stepped up to the dock  and offered Usagi his hand, helping her out of the boat.<p>
  “Oh, you’re so gentlemanly.”  Usagi said as she stepped on to the  dock.  <p>
  Mamoru avoided saying it was because Usagi likely  would have fallen into the water otherwise, though she was benefiting some from  these martial arts courses with Zhu Shu.   He simply pulled her close.  “Of  course.  You bring out the gentleman in  me.”<p>
  Usagi smiled and pulled him down for a long kiss.<p>
  Sadly, said kiss was interrupted.<p>
  All Usagi knew was that something heavy landed on her  head, knocking her to the ground.  When  she recovered enough to look up, she saw Mamoru had been knocked down, and a  small, vibrantly pink haired girl was kissing him.<p>
  “HEY.  <em>WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!?!</em>”  she yelled.<p>
  The pink haired girl turned, revealing eyes that were  a sinister shade of magenta.  “Usagi  Tsukino.  Why are you wearing my  trademarked odango?”<p>
  “Hey, odango are my trademark! And I’m Usagi Tsukino!”<p>
  “You are Usagi Tsukino?  Then you know where the Silver Crystal is!”  The small girl hopped over to Usagi and  produced a pistol, placing the barrel between Usagi’s eyes.  “Give it to me.”<p>
  “Now, now.”   Mamoru tried to move towards them.   “Little girls shouldn’t play with guns.”<p>
  “One more step and she gets it!”  The girl warned.  “Now I want the Silver Crystal!”  she said to Usagi.<p>
  “Um… err… um… I don’t know what you’re talking  about?”  Usagi tried.<p>
  “So, you won’t just give it to me, huh.  Too bad.”<p>
  The pink haired girl pulled the trigger as Mamoru  screamed “Nooo!” and dove towards Usagi.   He grabbed her as she fell backwards, then both their eyes went to the  small flower stuck to Usagi’s head by a suction cup.<p>
  “It was a toy?”   Usagi asked.<p>
  Mamoru looked for the girl to tell her it wasn’t a  funny joke…<p>
  But the pink haired girl had vanished.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“She’s going to be fine, Urd.  She’s just still weak.  As far as I can tell, she wasn’t mortally  wounded, just tortured.”  Belldandy said  as she came from the room they’d put Mara in.   “Though I shudder at the fact someone would do that to her.”<p>
  Urd nodded.   “The only one I can think of who could, would be Hild.  You’ve heard the stories.”<p>
  “I know.  I just  hate to think anyone could be that cruel.”   Belldandy said sadly.  She wrung  her hands in her apron.  “And I have no  idea what Legend did to her either.   She’s not a demon anymore.  I  think she’s a goddess.”<p>
  “How is that possible?   How can anyone change what she is?   I’ve never even heard of Kami-Sama doing that!” Urd shook her head.  “And wouldn’t the doublet system stop it?”<p>
  Belldandy raised her hands.  “I don’t know.”<p>
  Urd sighed.  “Is  she awake?”<p>
  Belldandy nodded.<p>
  Urd knocked on the door and opened it to the faint  response.  Mara looked up from her  breakfast.  “Urd!”<p>
  “Um, heya Mara.   Feeling better?”<p>
  “Much.  Belldandy  says I lost a lot of blood, so I have to eat to replace it.  I’m still a little woozy, but I can focus.”<p>
  Urd smiled.   “That’s good.  Do you remember  much?”<p>
  Mara shook her head.   “I was in a funk, I know that.  A  lot of my memories for the last couple of months are foggy.  I… I was angry a lot.  And I remember the pain, knowing that I was  going to be forced to hurt…” her voice faded so that Urd barely caught the  “you.” Mara couldn’t meet her eyes.<p>
  “You didn’t want to hurt me?”  Urd asked.   “You were saying you were going to make me your slave.”<p>
  Mara looked away.   “I’m sorry.  I don’t remember  much.  I know I was a bitch.”<p>
  “You’re always a bitch, Mara.  It’s your job.  You were positively <em>evil</em> for awhile though.”  Urd  laughed.<p>
  Mara sighed.  “I  never wanted to be a demon, Urd.  I  couldn’t help what I was born as.  I was  always jealous that you could choose; that you chose to be a goddess while I  had to be a demon.”<p>
  Urd blinked.  “I  never knew that.”<p>
  Mara gave her a half lidded look.  “No.   You never did.  You never asked  either.  Do you even have any idea how  hard I had to work to get assigned to you all as chief adversary?”<p>
  Urd shook her head.   “I thought it was just luck.”<p>
  Mara laughed.   “You wish.  I had to beat out  Velsper for it.”  She gave Urd another  half lidded look.  “I think it was worth  it.”<p>
  Urd shifted uncomfortably in her seat.  Those looks carried way more meaning than she  was sure she wanted to respond to.  Mara  noted the fidget and looked away.  Urd  sighed.<p>
  “Do you remember when Keiichi and I brought you here?”  she asked finally.<p>
  Mara nodded.   “It’s one of the few things I do remember clearly.  You held me in your arms as we started  leaving the apartment.”<p>
  Do… do you remember what you said?”<p>
  Mara shrugged.   “Do you?”<p>
  “I… I’m not sure.”<p>
  “Then don’t worry about it.”  Mara sighed.   “He did tell me there were no certainties.”<p>
  “The Dragon?”<p>
  Mara nodded.<p>
  “You’re in love with me aren’t you?”  Urd said.   “That’s what you said; ‘I love you’.”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  “For… for how long?”<p>
  Mara laughed bitterly.   “For forever.  Since we were in school  together.”<p>
  “I… I don’t know what to say.”<p>
  “Then don’t say anything.  Let me keep hoping that someday my love won’t  be in vain.”  Mara sighed.  “He gave me a choice, don’t you know, for  killing his daughter.  I could cease to  exist and escape Hild’s wraith, and no longer have to do her bidding, sparing  you from the mischief she wanted me to wreak.”<p>
  “Or?”  Urd  prompted.<p>
  “I could give up everything I was to him in exchange  for a chance.  Only a chance.”<p>
  “A chance at me?”<p>
  Mara nodded.  “I  gave up everything, my life, my job, even my powers as a demon.  I’m nothing anymore, Urd.  Just a mortal in love with a Goddess.  Gods, I can certainly sympathize with Keiichi  now.”<p>
  Urd blinked.   “Mara…”<p>
  “Please, Urd, I don’t need false words of comfort.”<p>
  “Belldandy said she thinks you’re a goddess now.”  Urd finished.<p>
  Mara blinked.   “What?”<p>
  Urd looked around and grabbed a hand mirror, handing  it to Mara.  The former demon looked, and  blinked.  “Yin Yang’s?”  <p>
  Urd raised an eyebrow and looked closely at Mara’s  marks.  It wasn’t obvious unless it was  in shadow, but she was right, the golden marks she had taken to be claws were  one half of the overall symbol.  The Yin  half was such a pale gold, it had blended in with her skin in the light.  In shadow, it contrasted better.<p>
  “We think Legend made you a Goddess…” Urd said  softly.  “…like me.”<p>
  Outside in the hall, the phone rang.  Urd and Mara both looked towards the  sound.  After a second, there was a knock  on the door and Belldandy peeked in.  “Um…  I have a phone call from Licensing… for a Mara, Goddess, third class,  probationary.”<p>
  Mara fainted.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Yes, okay, alright, Shan Pu’s IS my fiancée as well  as Ranma!”  Akane finally yelled to the  pestering girls in her gym class.  “<em>THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME A PERVERT!</em>”<p>
  “But if you’re marrying a girl, you have to be.”  Asuka said, holding her towel up to cover her  breasts.<p>
  Akane growled.   Shan Pu just had to give her a kiss and a swat on the rear in the hall  as they went to classes.  She was going  to kill the Amazon!<p>
  “Look.  I had to  get engaged to her because of the laws of her tribe!  Ranma’s Grandfather arranged some sort of  dual marriage with her as his other fiancée, so I had to get engaged too!”<p>
  “Why Ai Ren not tell truth?  She win Shan Pu in fair combat.”  Shan Pu’s voice came from behind her.<p>
  Akane turned to the dressing room door.  “What are you doing here?  Don’t you have class?”<p>
  “Shan Pu have Home Ec.   She teaches teacher right way make ramen.  Teacher send in hall, so Shan Pu come find Ai  Ren.  Ranma in boy gym, so come see other  Ai Ren.”<p>
  “Oh gods.”   Akane mumbled.  “Shan Pu, you  can’t just wonder the halls.  If the  teacher had you stand outside it was meant to be a punishment.”<p>
  “Punishment?   Teacher only give buckets of water to hold.  Shan Pu learn balance when child.  Put buckets on top of funny thing in yard  outside.”<p>
  Curious, Akane had to go to the door and look.  “That’s a goal post, Shan Pu.  How ever did you get them up there.”<p>
  “Jump.  Not too  high for Shan Pu.”<p>
  A flash of light from across the athletic field caught  Akane’s glance, and she blinked.  “That’s  funny.”<p>
  Shan Pu looked up from admiring Akane’s rear in the  tight fitting gym outfit.  “Humm?”<p>
  “I could have sworn I just saw somebody watching  us.  Someone in a long Chinese robe.”<p>
  Shan Pu looked out.   “No see anybody.”<p>
  “He’s gone now.”<p>
  “So you two want some privacy?”  Sayuri said.<p>
  Akane whirled.   “What?”<p>
  “She shows up and you just forget we’re here,  hummm?  And you say you’re not a  pervert?”<p>
  Shan Pu picked Sayuri up and said, “You no call Ai Ren  pervert!”<p>
  “Please put her down, Shan Pu.  This is my problem.”  Akane said.   As the Amazon set the girl down, Akane stepped forward.<p>
  “Now, I’m only going to say this once.  Yes, I do like girls as well as guys.  In my case this is limited to a very select  few girls.   Namely two: Zhu Shu and Shan  Pu.”<p>
  “Now, knowing I live with Zhu Shu, and her preferences  are well known, it should be obvious where that came from.  Now, Shan Pu is Zhu Shu’s sister, and that  should answer a few other questions.   Now, on top of that, Shan Pu can almost beat Ranma in a fight, and holds  even with me.  In light of all that, do  you really want to aggravate <em>any</em> of  us?”<p>
  Sayuri swallowed hard.   “Geez, Akane, we’re just joking.”<p>
  Akane looked around at the other girls in the  gym.  “Is that true?”<p>
  The other girls nodded, wide eyed.<p>
  “Good.  I will  consider the matter settled.”<p>
  “My Goddess!   There you are.  I’m so sorry I was  away for so long!  I got delayed in Australia, but  now I’m here!”<p>
  Akane cringed.   “Oh gods.  Kodachi’s back.”<p>
  The raven haired gymnast landed at Akane’s feet.  “What may I do to show my adoration for my  goddess?”<p>
  The feeling of a raging battle aura filled the air as  Shan Pu looked at Kodachi.  “Shan Pu  think not like what girl say.  Akane Shan  Pu Ai Ren.”<p>
  Kodachi looked at the Amazon.  “Ai Ren?”   she looked back at Akane.  “Have  you gotten some cheap Chinese whore to be your slave because I was gone,  Mistress?”  She gave Shan Pu a cool  look.  “I’m certain you must have been  desperate to have chosen such a barbarian.”<p>
  It was a good thing the gymnast was quick, as she  barely moved away from the sudden impact crater left by Shan Pu’s bon buri.<p>
  “Shan Pu kill!   Akane is Shan Pu Ai Ren.   Fiancée!”<p>
  “Fiancée?  My  Beloved Goddess?”  Kodachi laughed.  “I see my Mistress has been ensorcelled.  I say never!   I accept your challenge, barbarian!   I will trounce you and free my Goddess!”<p>
  “Idiot girl meet Shan Pu outside!”<p>
  “Pagh!  I shall  meet you in a proper challenge!  In one  week I shall meet you on the field of combat in the school gym!  The Rhythmic Gymnastics tryouts shall  determine which of us my Goddess shall favor!”   With a maniacal laugh, Kodachi started her rose petal blizzard.  “Farewell for now, Barbarian!”<p>
  Shan Pu incinerated the petals as Kodachi bounced away  across the field.  “Shan Pu very angry  now.  Make idiot bouncy girl very dead at  challenge.”<p>
  Akane sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>At lunch time, Ai watched Zhu Shu come out into the  school yard with a smile.  Phase one was  about to start.  She had been patient;  waiting for the Chinese girl to return to school, but now, the time to strike  had come.  She signaled the squad to  stand ready.<p>
  “Now remember, <em>don’t  let her distract you again</em>.  I don’t  want a repeat of last time.”<p>
  “But won’t that drink weaken her?” Kyoko asked.  “You said it was going to weaken her.”<p>
  “Yes, but that would only make losing to her even more  humiliating.  Stay focused!”<p>
  The five girls watched as part one was carried out  flawlessly.  The Hentai Squad, carefully  armed with Super Soaker Bazookas, managed to catch Zhu Shu after little more  than five minutes.  She shook her head  ruefully as she stood dripping in the thin white dress, then bowed to the crowd  of boys who had all fainted from nosebleeds.    <p>
  Ai’s eyes narrowed as Zhu Shu then went to her  customary spot near a tree at the edge of the field and set down to eat,  pulling out her small brazier and bento.   Ai paid special attention to the small thermos Zhu Shu pulled out,  grinning viciously as she sipped.  As Zhu  Shu finished her lunch, Ai gave the signal.<p>
  The blonde dragon girl sighed as the cheerleading  squad tumbled into the open area before her tree and struck poses.  Ai stepped down from the hands of Ayeka and  Megumi and gave Zhu Shu a long look.   “Okay, Zhu Shu.  We never settled  this last time, and I’ve trained my squad better.  I’m the prettiest girl in this school and  it’s time Furinkan re-learned that!”<p>
  “Ai not get argument from Zhu Shu that is pretty.  Has tried to get Hentai not chase.”  She gave the tall cheerleader a long  look.  “But is right.  Zhu Shu lose temper last time, not fight  well.  Is game for rematch.”<p>
  The news spread like it always did, and less than five  minutes later the athletic field was crowded.   Akane and Ranma stood at Zhu Shu’s end of the field looking at the  cheerleaders nervously.  <p>
  “Be careful, Zhu-chan.   Ai’s been training the squad pretty intensely since your last match.”  Akane said.<p>
  “Yeah.  Are you  sure you want to fight her in your cursed form?”  Ranma added.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Lose temper last time when change.   Maybe if already changed not lose control.”<p>
  “Okay.”<p>
  “And no interfere!”<p>
  “Okay, okay.  I  promised last time.  So long as she’s not  trying to outright kill you.”<p>
  “Don’t worry, Zhu-chan.  I’ll keep him out of it.”<p>
  A cheery “Ni hao!”   announced Shan Pu’s arrival.   “Heard Blood-Sister challenged.”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   “Is referee.  Make sure fight  fair.”<p>
  “Not one on one.   Zhu Shu fight squad.”<p>
  Shan Pu grinned.   “Even better.  Shan Pu like  melee.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head, and blinked at the wave of  dizziness. <p>
  “Sister okay?”   Shan Pu asked, noting the surprised look.<p>
  “Zhu Shu fine.” She stepped out onto the field to stop  any further questions.<p>
  Ai led off with a flying kick after being catapulted  by Ayeka and Megumi.  Zhu Shu dodged as  she reached to pull out her ribbons, then blinked in shock as she felt her chi  refuse to respond.  A wave of dizziness  struck as Ai’s heel slammed into the small of her back and hurled her towards  the waiting squad.<p>
  Ranma blinked as Zhu Shu landed in the middle of the  girls.  “Something’s wrong.  She’s moving way too slow.”<p>
  Akane blinked and nodded.  “She’s not glowing.  Her chi’s missing!”  She waved at Shan Pu, trying to get the  Amazon’s attention as she monitored the fight.   “Shan Pu!”<p>
  The Amazon was frowning at where Zhu Shu was blocking  several pom-pom thrusts.  She heard  Akane’s shout and hopped over, keeping her eyes on the fight.  “Why sister not use weapons?  She want lose?”<p>
  “Something’s wrong with her chi!” Akane hissed. “I  can’t see her aura!”  <p>
  Shan Pu raised an eyebrow.  “If sister no have chi, she maybe not win!”<p>
  “Oh man.  I  gotta stop this!”  Ranma said, preparing  to step out on the field.<p>
  “Ai Ren will not!   Is challenge!”  Shan Pu  responded.  “Will keep eye on  sister!  Ai Ren stay!” She jumped back  out into the center of the field towards the fight.<p>
  Zhu Shu for her part had just blocked a high kick from  Kaede when she felt her head spin savagely.   She stumbled to her knees as Ai smiled.   “Feeling a little punch drunk?”<p>
  Zhu Shu warily stood again and gave her a grim and  toothy smile.  “Again, Zhu Shu not fight  best.”  She yanked at the sash to her  dress, and lashed out with it, catching Ai’s leg and tripping her.  “But she still game.”<p>
  Kyoko and Megumi responded with an exploding pom-pom  attack that left Zhu Shu’s dress in tatters.  The dragon girl gave the viciously smiling  Kaede a glare as she stood smoking.  “Not  want make Zhu Shu mad!”<p>
  The glare lasted for a few seconds only as once more  the wave of dizziness hit, leaving her wide open for an air kick.  More cloth flew as Zhu Shu slammed into the  wall around the field.  She braced  herself against the wall as she tried to stand, but the dizziness was  overwhelming. <p>
  “Shan Pu call halt!”   she heard her Blood-Sister announce.   “Sister never fight this poor!   Shan Pu think Ai do something to Sister.”<p>
  “Stay out of this girl!  This is between Zhu Shu and my squad!”<p>
  Zhu Shu fought to her feet and nodded.  “I will fight, Shan Pu.  I’m just dizzy.”  She said in Chinese.  “This is between Ai and I.”  She turned to the blonde cheerleader.  “Zhu Shu not care if Ai cheat.  Still will beat.”<p>
  “Big words, Zhu Shu.   Won’t be so easy without your magic.”<p>
  “Sister no need magic deal with pervert girl.” Shan Pu  said as she handed a pair of wooden practice swords to Zhu Shu.  “She only need sword.”<p>
  Zhu Shu took the swords and smiled.  “When ready.”<p>
  The other cheerleaders looked to Ai for a cue.  Ai smiled.   “I think maybe I like it when you’re naked Zhu Shu.  Maybe after I’ve beaten you, you can be my  pet.”  <p>
  Ayeka’s eyes burned at Zhu Shu as the Chinese girl  nodded.  “You say same last time.  Still no do.”<p>
  Ai’s eyes gave her just enough warning to jump above  the pair of batons that cut across where her ankles had been , but without chi,  her speed wasn’t enough to avoid a second volley of exploding pom-poms.  Barely enough of her dress survived the blast  to keep the Hentai squad from going comatose, but the explosion left her  reeling.  She recovered just in time to  meet a baton attack from Ayeka that would have sent her into  unconsciousness.  Her swords twisted as  she sent the batons flying into Kaede, doubling her over.<p>
  “Y-you bitch!” Kaede choked out.  “I’ll get you for that!”  She launched herself at the dragon girl.<p>
  Zhu Shu met the attack with a parry and a twist that  sent Kaede face first into the ground, but it left her open as Ai once more  planted both feet in her back.  She  staggered forward into a simultaneous Air Kick and pom-pom barrage, the impacts  driving the wind from her as she was hurled into the wall around the field  again.  She slammed into the concrete  with a gasp of pain as within her she felt her hold over her anger fail, and a  sound of a vast beast roaring in triumph filled her ears<p>
  She faintly  heard Akane scream her name as the world turned inside out and fire burned  along every nerve.  She lurched forwards  on her hands and knees as she tilted her head back and screamed.  It felt like her very soul was burning.<p>
  The entire school watched in amazement as a column of  fire shot out of Zhu Shu’s mouth and engulfed the bench by the field. As the  flames died, ash drifted down from where the bench had been.  Zhu Shu shakily stood and stumbled a few  steps clutching her head as her aura returned, glowing a swirling gold streaked  with black.  The cheerleaders stepped  back, wondering what was happening.<p>
  Zhu Shu hit her knees again, her aura growing brighter  and brighter as she moaned softly.  With  a loud tearing noise, the remaining shreds of her dress ripped asunder as a  pair of small wings sprouted from her shoulders and a thick tail sprouted from  her spine, both covered in tiny black scales.   The claws on her fingers grew another inch longer and sturdier as a pair  of horns pushed through her hair and swept back behind her ears, which had also  grown longer.  As the flaring of her aura  died, she coughed, a puff of smoke escaping her mouth.<p>
  Ai was staring transfixed as the entire school  gasped.  Blood gushed in rivers from the  noses of most of the boys as the nearly naked half dragon shook her head to  clear it.  Zhu Shu tried to stand, and  stumbled.  She didn’t seem to notice as  her wings fluttered and set her back upright, her stance none to steady.  Her eyes locked on Ai, the anger in them  nearly incandescent.  “What do!  What do to Zhu Shu!”  She launched herself at the tall cheerleader,  not realizing she was flying as she grabbed her and lifted her effortlessly  thirty feet off the ground.  “<em>WHAT DO TO ZHU SHU!!!!</em>”<p>
  Ai stammered.   “It- it was just Dragon Wine.  It-  it was supposed to make you a little drunk!”   Ai gulped.  “It’s only alcoholic  for dragons!  It wasn’t supposed to do  this!”<p>
  “Zhu Shu!   You’re flying!”  Akane yelled up  at the transformed girl.  “You grew  wings!”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, and looked over her shoulder, to  where her small wings were working overtime to keep her hovering.  “Zhu Shu can fly?”  She turned back to Ai, her eyes wide.  “Zhu Shu can fly?”<p>
  Ai nodded.  “Um?  yeah?”<p>
  She screamed as Zhu Shu let her go, only to be grabbed  a second later in an embrace.  She looked  into the dragon girls eyes fearfully.  <p>
  The anger was gone, replaced by a different  light.  “<em>ZHU SHU CAN FLY!!!!!</em>”<p>
  And there, in mid air, in front of the entire school,  she bussed Ai noisily on the lips with a loud “MMMMMMWAH!” before setting Ai  back down on the ground.  She smiled at  the blonde cheerleader and offered “Zhu Shu can fly,” by way of an explanation.<p>
  “YOU BITCH!”   Ayeka screamed as Ai blinked in confusion.  Zhu Shu turned to the raven haired girl.<p>
  “Zhu Shu can fly!” She said happily, trying to convey  the immensity of that fact to the steaming Ayeka, but the jealous girl would  have none of it.<p>
  “You have kissed my darling Ai!  For this sin, I, Ayeka, can never forgive  you!”  The tall raven haired girls eyes  had gone an almost glowing red as she glared at the dragon girl.  Wielding her baton like a two handed sword  she charged.<p>
  Zhu Shu dodged out of her way and fluttered over to  where Akane and Shan Pu were watching the exchange with dropped jaws.  “Zhu Shu can fly!” she said to them, hoping  against hope she was conveying the importance of this to the stunned  girls.  <p>
  Akane nodded.   “You can fly?”  She blinked  “Watch out!”<p>
  “I’ll kill you with one swing!” Ayeka screamed as her  baton, glowing with the orange light of her angry ki slashed down through the  air where Zhu Shu had been fluttering.  <p>
  Zhu Shu had zipped behind her.  She pursed her lips and let fly with a stream  of fire, engulfing the enraged girl.   “ZHU SHU CAN FLY!”  Why couldn’t  anyone understand?<p>
  The soot covered girl, protected by her chi aura,  coughed a small puff of black smoke.   “Perhaps I have underestimated you.   I will forever regret this.”  Then  she gave a mad grin in which it almost looked like her teeth had become fangs.  “But now the real action begins!  Die!”   She swung her glowing baton at Zhu Shu again in a swing that would have  sliced her in half.<p>
  Zhu Shu had dodged behind her.  “Zhu Shu can fly!”  she tried explaining again.<p>
  “Don’t think you can talk your way out of this  one!  I, Ayeka will not fall for your  charms, you sneaky dragon girl!”  She  swung repeatedly as Zhu Shu dodged.   Backing up across the field she came to the goal post.  Without thinking about it, she bent it  backwards with one hand as Ayeka advanced, then let go to let the post slam  into the cheerleaders face.<p>
  Akane cheered as Ayeka stumbled back several steps,  dazed, but Kaede decided to lend a hand and threw an exploding pom-pom at Zhu  Shu.  Caught unawares, the dragon girl  was knocked to the ground by the explosion.   Ayeka shook herself and recovered enough to start swinging again.<p>
  “DIE!  DIE! DIE!  DIE! DIE!” she screamed as Zhu Shu dodged blow after blow, rolling on the  ground, shedding the final scraps of her dress.   With a last dodge, she leaped up to the cross bar of the goal post.<p>
  “You can’t get away!”   Ayeka yelled.  “I won’t let you  escape!”  She leaped after Zhu Shu, landing  on the cross post.  “I ATTACK!”<p>
  Zhu Shu dodged her downward slice, blinking as the  baton sheared through the post.  Ayeka  blinked as the cross post creaked, then gave way under her.  She crashed to the ground.  Zhu Shu blinked down at the fallen girl.<p>
  “I, Ayeka, shall forever regret this!”  The girl moaned.  Zhu Shu fluttered down to see if she was  okay.<p>
  “Why don’t you just give up?”  Akane yelled at the raven haired girl.  Ayeka’s head popped up.<p>
  “I, Ayeka, will never give up!  MEGUMI!”<p>
  A pair of pom-poms connected by a wire wrapped around  Zhu Shu, entangling her wings and arms and grounding her.  The blonde haired cheerleader looked down  from the goalpost and shrugged.  “She’s  my teammate.  Even if she is currently  insane.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked sadly at the charging  cheerleader.  She’d failed to communicate  the immensity of being able to fly to the girl, and now she wasn’t going to be  able to fly anymore.<p>
  “Oh, for Pete’s sake!” Ranma growled as he jumped  forwards and kicked the baton out of Ayeka’s hands.  It lost its glow as it flew up, watched by  the crowd.  Ayeka stared dumbstruck at  her empty hands.<p>
  Then the baton bounced off her skull and she looked at  Zhu Shu in amazement.<p>
  “One more step… and I could have… avenged the squad…  and earned a reward from Ai… and regained our popularity…  I… Ayeka… shall… forever… regret… this…”<p>
  With the last words, Ayeka collapsed to the ground,  out cold.  Zhu Shu blinked at her, then  looked at Ranma pleadingly.  “Zhu Shu can  fly?”<p>
  Ranma unwrapped the pom-pom bolo from around her.  “Yes.   Zhu Shu can fly.  Maybe we should  have you fly to Doctor Tofu’s?  You’re  acting <em>really</em> strange.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   It seemed like a brilliant suggestion to the happy fog in her brain, and  she told him so.<p>
  “Zhu Shu can FLY!”</p>
