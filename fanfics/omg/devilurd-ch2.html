<h1>The Devil and Miss Urd (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/devilurd-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>A loud knocking on the door jarred Belldandy from her
thoughts of what to make for dinner. &#147;Mara?&#148; Belldandy
said to her questioningly, looking out the opened door
at the leather clad, slightly damp devil who was
standing there on the porch.

Mara gazed back at her steadily, her long hair
plastered down by the storm, a odd look in her eyes
that Belldandy had never seen there before. &#147;Is Urd
here?&#148; Mara finally asked her quietly, but with a
great intensity.

Belldandy blinked at her in astonishment, she had also
never heard that sort of respectful tone in Mara&#146;s
voice before. &#147;Yes, certainly,&#148; Belldandy said once
she recovered from her surprise and directed Mara to
Urd&#146;s room.

&quot;Was that...?&quot; Keiichi asked Belldandy a moment later,
having passed Mara in the hallway.

&quot;She&#39;s here to see Urd,&quot; Belldandy said reassuringly.
She smiled, her expression thoughtful, &quot;Maybe now Urd
will be able to relax.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Keiichi ran a hand through his hair,
&quot;she&#39;s been jumpy ever since Mara disappeared on us.&quot;

&quot;Belldandy, did someone come in?&quot; Skuld asked
curiously.

&quot;Just a guest of Urd&#39;s,&quot; Belldandy answered
diplomatically, well aware of Skuld&#39;s annoyance with
the demon Mara.

Mara cat walked down the hall silently, with every
step forward fighting the increasing urge to turn
around and run right back out of the temple the way
she came. Mara knocked once again, this time more
gently on Urd&#146;s doorway. It suddenly slid open and
Urd&#146;s eyes widened as they took in Mara standing there
at her doorstep.

&#147;Why aren&#146;t the protective charms working?&#148; Urd
finally asked Mara, feeling slightly stunned at the
total failure of those defenses.

Mara smiled and shrugged a bit sheepishly. &#147;I&#146;m not
here in a professional capacity so they probably
aren&#39;t active,&#148; Mara answered her with a smile.
&#147;Are... are you all right?&#148; Mara asks her quietly,
remembering how frail good Urd had looked after the
battle with her evil side.

Urd looked thoughtfully at Mara for a moment, and then
she smiled. &#147;I&#146;m fine, now.&quot; With a wave she gestured
for her guest to go in, &quot;Come in, why don&#146;t you?&#148;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Mara said as she walked in, taking a look
around curiously. The room looked just like a mad
chemist&#146;s laboratory, with beakers, vials and potions
and odd shaped pills scattered around the room. In
other words, it was pure Urd. Mara took a chair, while
Urd just sat on the side of her bed, smiling oddly at
her.

The two looked at each other in silence for long
seconds until Mara couldn&#146;t take it anymore. She
finally burst out with, &#147;I lied!&#148;

Urd blinked a bit, that wasn&#146;t quite what she was
expecting to hear. &#147;Lied about what?&#148; she asked her
with a frown.

Mara quickly got up from the chair and started pacing
the small room restlessly. &#147;When I brought the device
back, I told your sisters,&#148; she said as she gestured
out to where Belldandy and Skuld&#146;s rooms were, &#147;that I
couldn&#146;t let you die because I hadn&#146;t beaten you at
Tetris yet.&#148; She shrugged and smiled a little at Urd&#146;s
quiet laughter. &#147;I guess I thought they&#146;d believe
that, but I really, I... Urd, I really saved you
because I...&#148;

It was obvious to Urd that Mara was struggling with
something, some deep secret or unpleasant truth that
she was unsure about revealing. Urd got up and stood
by Mara, stopping her restless pacing and gently
taking her cold hand. She rubbed the chilled flesh
between her own hands even as she smiled at her
gently.

&#147;Please, Mara, tell me what&#146;s wrong,&#148; Urd urged her
softly, &#147;I&#146;ve known you so long, you know you can tell
me anything.&#148;

&#147;I sure hope so.&#148; Mara said a bit sadly, gazing
longingly into Urd&#146;s eyes. She said it all in one
breath, &#147;IsavedyoubecauseIloveyou!&#148;

Urd looked over at Mara with eyes wide in surprise, as
she felt something stirring in her heart. &#147;What?&#148; Urd
asked Mara softly, wanting to be sure of what she
heard, and to hear her say those words to her once
again.

Mara was crying just a little bit as she repeated it
more slowly, &#147;I saved you because I love you.&#148; She
tried to pull away, to run from Urd, but Urd kept her
hold on Mara&#146;s hand.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; Urd smiled at her gently.

Urd suddenly pulled Mara into her arms and hugged her
fiercely, then she drew Mara in for a kiss. Just then,
the door to Urd&#146;s room slammed open loudly, but
neither one paid any attention, refusing to break
their intense kiss.

&#147;Nobody move, and keep you&#146;re hands where I can see
them...&#148; Skuld shouted before she trailed off in
surprise.

The small battle armored figure standing in the
doorway gaped at them in shock, Skuld&#146;s eyes wide with
astonishment, her suit&#146;s gun arm still pointed a bit
unsteadily at them. Urd and Mara stood frozen in their
romantic clasp. Belldandy wandered by, stopped cold,
and walked back to take another look at the frozen
tableau.

Urd spoke from the side of her mouth, as her lips were
just a bit busy at the moment: &#147;Get out of my room,
now!&#148;

&quot;Come along, Skuld dear...,&quot; Belldandy quickly grabbed
the still very stunned Skuld and quickly dragged her
off as she left.

&quot;But.. they&#39;re doing, I mean...&quot; Skuld stammered.

&quot;Just leave it alone,&quot; Belldandy&#39;s voice faded as they
walked away.

&#147;Well that nearly spoiled the moment,&#148; a broadly
smiling Mara commented, keeping Urd in her arms. &#147;Does
she do that often?&#148;

&#147;Oh, yeah.&#148; Urd answered, laughing. &#147;You should see
poor Keiichi and Belldandy try to have a date. I&#146;d
swear that kid has a sixth sense.&#148;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Mara chuckled. &quot;Did you mean what you
said?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Urd began to gently sway them around the
room, almost as if they were dancing. Another
lingering kiss and, &quot;I&#39;ve loved you for years.&quot;

Mara sighed, &quot;Me, too. Wish one of us had been able to
tell the other earlier.&quot;

Their course made it over to the small bed, and with a
gesture Urd sent them falling to the bed. She smiled
down at Mara wickedly, &quot;Then let&#39;s make up for lost
time...&quot;

Mara slid her arms around Urd&#39;s neck and drew her down
into a kiss, &quot;Lets.&quot;

The End

Author&#39;s Notes: Based around the Oh My Goddess manga
series, rather than the anime series or movie,
including the manga story &#39;The devil in Miss Urd.&#39; The
manga spells out a long and intimate friendship
between Urd and Mara, one having gone on since they
were kids. It does NOT say they are actually a couple,
but I do think it&#39;s quite possible, considering their
personalities and some of the scenes between the two
of them.

Edit: Revised the fic to try and fix the tenses a bit,
and I tossed Keiichi in considering he was totally
absent from my first draft. ^_^;; What can I say, my
usual focus is on the girls. With the release of the
new anime series I thought this was a good time to
reformat this, and I hope you enjoy reading it.</pre>
