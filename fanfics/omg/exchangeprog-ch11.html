<h1>The Goddess Exchange Program (part 11 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/justjun.html">JustJun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/exchangeprog-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>I awoke with a start as my head slid off my arms. Damn I fell asleep 
again. How can I protect everyone if I keep falling asleep? I slapped 
myself lightly and focused. I was dreaming of it again, a complete 
angel. No matter how powerful I am in heaven, what&#39;s the point if I 
can&#39;t even summon both of my angels? I bet it&#39;s the reason why I was 
rejected by the angel eater, it doesn&#39;t want to eat uncompleted angels 
after all. I need more power, only then will I be able to protect 
everyone, only then will I be able to protect Peorth. She is my number 
one priority in life now, she takes place over missions, over my 
Valkyrie duty, over earth and dare I say even Kami-sama. Love is 
powerful. It is a shame I didn&#39;t realise that earlier.

The door behind me slid open and out came Belldandy, happy and graceful 
as always.

&quot;Lind you look as if you&#39;re in pain&quot; she said and sat down beside me.

&quot;I&#39;m fine just contemplating...Belldandy I&#39;m sorry. I have the power to 
fight yet I could be your shield.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true. We appreciate the fact that you&#39;re here with us now 
despite the circumstances.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s only what I&#39;m supposed to do. I am a Valkyrie after all. I feel 
joy from fighting, so even if I&#39;m not appreciated its fine.&quot; She stood 
up and leapt onto the ground stepping lightly and bringing life and 
growth to the area.

&quot;Lind can you feel it? This garden is splendid isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s because 
this world is full of life. Can you feel it? The miracle the wind 
brings. Can you hear it? The sound of light shining down.&quot;

I understand Belldandy. You&#39;re trying to cheer me up aren&#39;t you?

&quot;Even I have an emotional side. My joy doesn&#39;t only come from fighting&quot; 
I said and lifted my hand out to bring forth a flower.

&quot;Yes we feel joy from other things too. For example when someone 
acknowledges you for the things you do. Or the joy felt when someone you 
love is with you.&quot; I feel that joy a lot nowadays.

I see that&#39;s why Belldandy is...

&quot;Peorth!&quot; Screamed Skuld.

&quot;Peorth!&quot; I said and flew to the area instantly.

I arrived at the living room to see Skuld and Keiichi already there. I 
entered and I saw an unconscious Peorth lying on the floor. Her hair was 
spread out and her eyes lifeless. I failed.

I was paralyzed with shock and fear. I couldn&#39;t move, I couldn&#39;t blink I 
didn&#39;t even know if I was breathing. My Peorth is...gone. Damn! What 
kind of protector am I? I clenched my fists and gritted my teeth; I will 
destroy whoever is behind this heinous plot. Peorth promised this 
wouldn&#39;t happen. Damn it she promised me! I felt a hand on my shoulder 
and saw Belldandy looking at me with a soft comforting expression.

&quot;How come she got attacked even though we&#39;ve been so cautious?&quot; Asked 
Keiichi.

&quot;The angel eater must have a special method,&quot; said Belldandy as she 
checked Peorth&#39;s vitals.

&quot;We must change our strategy. In order to salvage all the angels we must 
catch the angel eater. So do not be alone. Whilst one person is being 
attacked the other can catch it,&quot; I said. It was a strategy I didn&#39;t 
want to revert to but what choice did we have?

&quot;What if both of you get attack simultaneously?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very unlikely. It could have attacked us all from the beginning 
but it&#39;s only targeted individuals. I don&#39;t think you two have anything 
to worry about but never the less be careful.&quot; Keiichi nodded 
affirmatively at me and Skuld looked disheartened. Belldandy will 
comfort her, she&#39;ll be ok.

I bent down and picked Peorth up placing one arm under her legs and the 
other under her arms; she&#39;s so light. In all honesty, I could have 
simply carried her with magic, but I need to hold her. To feel her pulse 
and know for sure that she&#39;s still alive.

&quot;You three stay here.&quot;

&quot;But Lind what if you get attacked? You&#39;re alone,&quot; said Keiichi.

&quot;If that happens I am prepared.&quot; He slid the door open for me and I 
carried Peorth to Urd&#39;s room. Urd still lay peacefully with a blanket 
draped over her. I carefully knelt down and placed Peorth beside her. I 
closed my eyes for a second and opened them again, hoping that what I 
saw wasn&#39;t real. It didn&#39;t work. The reality was Peorth had her angel 
stolen and it&#39;s my entire fault, some protector I am. My knees fell to 
ground with a thud, and I slammed the floor with my fist. Why did it 
have to be Peorth? Seeing her in this state is unbearable. I know she&#39;s 
alive but she&#39;s not with me. She&#39;s not talking, not moving just 
breathing. I find solace in the fact that she still is breathing, thank 
goodness.

I bent down and kissed her forehead, my lips lingered there hoping my 
kiss would wake her up. I have the power to grant life yet I can&#39;t awake 
her. I caressed her cheek lightly and moved the hair from her face, she 
takes pride in the neatness of her hair, tidying it is the least I can 
do. I realise I can&#39;t cry, no I cannot seem weak in front of everyone. 
This is a recoverable situation so I refuse to cry until defeat stares 
me in the face...But...even so why does my heart feel so heavy? I stood 
up slowly and closed the door behind me as I left. I swear I&#39;ll fix this 
Peorth.

----------

I watched as Keiichi cut paper and stuck them together, and then he 
started laughing to himself. What a weird human he is. Belldandy was 
comforting Skuld as she checked on Peorth and Urd again. There is no 
change in their condition, I know, I&#39;ve only checked every minute.

&quot;I thought there would be something I could do, so I came up with this 
plan. I call it operation Dummy angel!&quot; Keiichi said proudly and showed 
us his creation. Splendid a cardboard angel...just what I need right 
now.

&quot;What something so simple like that? Haha I already made an angel. 
Tadaa!&quot; said Skuld and she produced a mechanical angel from nowhere. Of 
course Belldandy smiled at the creations but they were useless.

&quot;Your effort is appreciated but its effectiveness is very doubtful&quot; I 
stated folding my arms.

&quot;Wh, Why?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s common between the two who got attacked?&quot;

&quot;THEY BOTH ACT LIKE QUEENS?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;OVERCONFIDENCE?&quot;

&quot;Indeed but...&quot;

&quot;THEY EXPOSE A LOT OF THEMSELVES?&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t comment on that.&quot;

&quot;Both of them knew the angel eater was here but their angels were still 
pulled out,&quot; said Belldandy. At least this house has one reasonable 
voice.

&quot;That&#39;s right. The angel eater is able to attack the angels even if they 
don&#39;t appear. Therefore I reject your operation&quot; I said and looked at 
Skuld and Keiichi. &quot;However you&#39;re mind-set is acknowledged.&quot;

&quot;Are we being praised?&quot; said Keichi.

&quot;I believe the next target will be me since the angel eater I&#39;ve been on 
earth longer than Lind...I&#39;m going to take a bath&quot; said Belldandy. Does 
she enjoy danger? A bath alone with an angel eater on the loose?

&quot;I&#39;ll join you unless you want to be a lure.&quot;

&quot;Onee-sama that&#39;s dangerous!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. Lind is here after all.&quot; I hope what you say is true 
Belldandy. Already two of your comrades and friends have fallen despite 
me being here and yet you still believe in me. I don&#39;t even know if I 
believe in me anymore.

&quot;She came for us last time and protected us. So she can do it again. 
That&#39;s why I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Thank you for your unshakable faith 
Belldandy. Despite my weakness, I will protect you and salvage 
everyone&#39;s angels. everything will return to normal.


----------

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Lind?&quot; Asked Belldandy clad in a towel.

&quot;Was there something wrong with the way I said it? I acknowledged them 
but they didn&#39;t look happy.&quot;

&quot;Lind that&#39;s simple. It&#39;s because you didn&#39;t&#39; smile.&quot;

A smile? Is it really as simple as that? I looked in the mirror and 
stared at myself. I have no reason to smile.

&quot;How are smiles made again without a source of happiness?&quot;

&quot;Smile&#39;s aren&#39;t made, they&#39;re shown. When you feel something it&#39;s shown 
naturally from the bottom of your heart.&quot;

&quot;From the bottom of my heart...&quot;

&quot;Lind you&#39;re driving yourself into a corner over something, because of 
that you&#39;ve forgotten how to smile.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because everything is my fault. I&#39;m not powerful enough so I 
wasn&#39;t able to protect everyone. I might as well not be here I&#39;m...&quot;

A sharp pain struck through my heart and I stumbled and fell to the 
ground. It&#39;s happening again, the swirling of feathers, the intense 
pain. Memories of my own angels flooded my mind, their creation, their 
separation, and memories of constantly only summoning one angel. When I 
awoke feathers fell through the air and an unconscious Belldandy lay 
before me. The realisation hit me like one of Urd&#39;s thunderbolts; I am 
the cause. Everything really is my fault.

&quot;Lind I heard a loud bang it everything alright?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t come!&quot; I yelled and quickly placed a barrier on the door.

&quot;Wahh!&quot; Yelled Skuld as the door closed suddenly. I can&#39;t endanger her 
as well.

&quot;Sorry I can&#39;t let you near me right now!&quot;

&quot;Wait what&#39;s happened&quot; shouted Keiichi through the door. I managed to 
stand up but my body felt stiff.

&quot;I have found the location of the angel eater, it seems to have 
parasitized me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s true no matter what viewpoint you look at.&quot;

&quot;In that case if you hadn&#39;t have come here none of this would have 
happened!&quot; Yelled Skuld.

She&#39;s right. Why did I come here? My destination was earth but this 
specific place where 4 goddesses dwell?

&quot;At the time I thought it was an emergency and since I was the only one 
that survived an angel eater attack I came to earth. However, this 
place? This house? These goddesses? Was it already controlling me back 
then?&quot;

I looked to the ceiling where a demon signel was forming. I summoned my 
axe and waited for it to appear. Just what I need.

&quot;Sorry to have kept you waiting!&quot;

&quot;Wahhh!&quot; I shouted as I slammed my axe into the demon. It was Hild-sama, 
or at least a form of her. The force of my axe was stopped, damn her she 
managed to catch my axe midway.

&quot;Don&#39;t get too cocky&quot; she said in a condescending tone. This is her 
fault! She set the angel eater free. She endangered goddesses. She 
caused Peorth to be like this. I&#39;ll destroy her!

I spun my axe around and slammed her into the wall with my axe trapping 
her. Even she was surprised with my ferocity. I&#39;ll destroy you I thought 
as I summoned an energy ball in my palm and punched it at her. She 
smiled a deathly smile and glared at me. Does she think this is a game. 
My punch was thrown off course as I hit a powerful barrier and I ended 
up destroying a part of the wall.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? No need to be so surprised after all you can&#39;t kill me 
you&#39;ll only be killing yourself.&quot; I had forgotten the doublet system 
actually; I couldn&#39;t care less if I killed her and consequently killed 
myself, as long as the angels are returned.

&quot;Why did you send an angel eater after everyone?!&quot; I yelled directly to 
her face.

&quot;Because you guys are my beloved hosts.&quot;

&quot;Hosts?&quot;

&quot;Yes hosts. Putting Urd-chan aside because of her demon blood. I 
wondered if I took out their angels and putting in a tsukaima would turn 
them into devils.&quot; The axe fell to the ground and she floated forwards 
trying to intimidate me.

&quot;Do you think I would allow that?!&quot; I said and went to punch her.

&quot;Come out my cute kittens.&quot; I fell to the ground immediately. The pain 
again! Not now! I clenched my stomach and yelled out in pain. A light 
emit from the room as my angel came forth. I gripped my stomach even 
tighter when a larger being came forth from my back. I felt like I was 
being ripped in two. When the pain stopped and both beings were out I 
couldn&#39;t move at all, I could only stare up in anger at the devil.

&quot;How does it feel the reality? Do you understand it now? I control the 
angel eater and in turn you. You belong to me Lind. Haha you are the 
perfect vessel for my little kitten. Your own lust for a real angel only 
makes my kitten stronger. Hehehe should I pull out your angel now too 
and get it over with?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a pity you can&#39;t. All devil&#39;s powers will be reflected because of 
the barrier I set up in this room.&quot;

&quot;Oh so I can&#39;t escape?&quot;

&quot;Want to give it a go?&quot; I may be in pain and I may not be as powerful as 
her, but I still can set up a trap.

&quot;Hehe goddesses are fools. You are all fools. Not only are you fighting 
alone but you purposely create weaknesses for yourself. If I take out 
the angel the goddess if rendered useless. Why would you want something 
like that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something a devil would never understand. If you share a common 
weakness, you share a common joy. If you halve the weakness you halve 
the joy and the strength to fight as well.&quot;

&quot;What you&#39;re sharing is your burden right now you realise.&quot; Little does 
she know how much I&#39;m willing to sacrifice to free everyone&#39;s angels and 
sort this crisis out. Cool mint placed her hand onto my shoulder 
comfortingly, you know what I&#39;m going to do don&#39;t you my angel? I 
smirked at Hild

&quot;Then I&#39;ll remove my burden!&quot;

I yelled and with a strength I didn&#39;t know I had. I pulled on cool mint 
and broke the bonds between us. It felt like swords were stabbing my 
back as our binding magic was broken and the angel eaters tentacles 
separated from me. Yelling from pain I threw them sideways and the angel 
eater slammed into the wall. Despit my ragged breathing and tired body I 
glared at Hild with all my energy threatening her with my eyes. Our 
fight has only just begun.

interesting to Mara. listen.

Peorth&#39;s father: So what you do is you insert it in real nice and slow, 
being careful and making sure she&#39;s not hurt. Then you check to see if 
it&#39;s a perfect fit before plunging in fully.

Mara: Uhuh really

Peorth&#39;s father: Then once it fits in really nicely what I like to do is 
just put it in and out a few times really quick before turning 180 
degrees

M: 180? That&#39;s why I can&#39;t do it I always do 360

Lind and Peorth sweetdrop

P: FATHER WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TELLING MARA

away.

Belldandy: Hello Angel eater- san.
