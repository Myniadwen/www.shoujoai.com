<h1>A Goddess Comes to Call (part 8 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/godcall-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Two days later, Sylia, Priss and Nene were in one of the Knight Saber 
headquarters&#39; computer rooms staring at the images Sylia was calling 
up and printing out. &quot;Incredible,&quot; Sylia said softly, intently 
studying the computer screen. On the screen are pictures of several 
different despots and dictators, and standing beside each and every 
one is a woman with a decidedly sinister look on her pretty face.

&quot;Is that who I think it is?&quot; Priss asked Sylia softly.

Sylia shrugged, &quot;The woman seems to be Mara. The other people span the 
twentieth and twenty first centuries.&quot;

&quot;My god,&quot; Nene said softly. &quot;Where did you find this?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t all of it. I&#39;m still doing visual matches through other 
photo archives based on the Goddesses and Mara, but I&#39;ve found several 
matches already, from the 1800&#39;s onward,&quot; Sylia quietly explained. 
&quot;Nene,&quot; Sylia turned to ask her, &quot;could you check the AD Police files 
for me? They&#39;re connected to some databases I have difficulty 
accessing.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Sylia, no problem,&quot; Nene said, taking the disk Sylia handed 
her.

Priss and Sylia left the computer lab shortly after Nene did, and 
walked together to the newly dubbed residential wing. &quot;So how&#39;s the 
situation with Urd?&quot; Sylia asked Priss curiously.

Priss shrugged, an odd look on her handsome face. &quot;She&#39;s not jumping 
me when I go into the room anymore, but...&quot; Priss struggled for words. 
&quot;I think there might be something more serious going on, now.&quot;

&quot;You like her, don&#39;t you?&quot; Sylia asked gently.

&quot;I have to admit, she grows on you,&quot; Priss acknowledged. &quot;But she&#39;s 
also a immortal goddess. I mean, just think of the age gap!&quot; Priss 
joked.

&quot;And the amount of experience?&quot; Sylia teased her with a smile on her 
face.

Priss blushed softly, and didn&#39;t answer. They entered the three suites 
and living room the small group was using. Skuld had a hardsuit 
helmet, and was tinkering with the heads up display. Urd sits on one 
couch, and Linna and Belldandy sat on the other.

Urd saw Priss walk in and her face lit up in a smile. &quot;Hi,&quot; Urd said, 
getting up and walking over to Priss&#39;s side. &quot;You&#39;ve been making 
yourself scarce lately,&quot; she said, gently taking Priss&#39;s arm.

Priss blushed, &quot;Rehearsals with my band. We&#39;ve been trying to work the 
bugs out of some new numbers.&quot;

&quot;You sing as well?&quot; Urd said cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;d look forward to seeing 
you... perform,&quot; Urd said, gently teasing her. Priss blushed brightly.

Sylia watched with a great deal of amusement as Urd maneuvered Priss 
to sit by her on the couch, then she sat across from them, setting a 
file folder in front of her. &quot;I&#39;ve been doing some research, but I 
also have some questions for the three of you. Would you mind?&quot; She 
opened the folder and laid out the photo of Mara.

Urd winced a bit, and Belldandy looked over at her sympathetically. 
&quot;That&#39;s Mara,&quot; Belldandy said softly, &quot;a Demoness First Class.&quot; She 
picked up her tea and sipped a bit, looking uncomfortable. Linna took 
her hand, and Belldandy smiled over at her gratefully. She continued 
&quot;Her job involves making bargains for mortals in exchange for their 
souls, and to thwart the actions of Goddesses on this plane of 
existence.&quot;

Sylia looked serious as she gazed at Urd and said, &quot;There seemed to be 
something almost... personal, about her reaction to you. What was that 
about?&quot;

Urd sighed softly. &quot;We&#39;ve been friends for a very long time,&quot; Urd 
admitted.

Priss looked at her in mild disbelief, &quot;If the two of you are friends, 
I wouldn&#39;t want to see how she treats her enemies!&quot;

Urd shrugs, &quot;Off duty, we&#39;re friends. Get drunk, do karaoke, play 
Tetris, and occasionally sleep together. On duty, on the other hand, 
we have to go at each other all out.&quot;

&quot;Sleep together?&quot; Nene echoed, blushing fiercely.

&quot;Among Goddesses and other higher beings, it&#39;s not that big of a deal. 
But I think Mara may have fallen in love with me,&quot; Urd admitted with a 
sigh. She added &quot;I only began to notice in the last century or so, and 
I&#39;ve been trying to dissuade her, for her sake as well as mine.&quot;

&quot;Why would a relationship between you and her be a problem?&quot; Linna 
asked, avoiding looking over at Belldandy.

Belldandy smiled sadly as she answered for Urd, &quot;The rules are very 
strict in these cases. Demon and God must remain separate, so that we 
can perform the tasks assigned to us by the Almighty. Urd and Mara 
were nearly violating the rules already by being friends, and if they 
became lovers and partners, the punishment would be... unthinkable.&quot;

Skuld nodded, and said seriously, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a case in my 
lifetime, but I understand the punishments were terrible.&quot;

Sylia asked some more questions about Mara&#39;s powers and abilities, but 
got frustratingly imprecise answers. So much depended on if Mara had 
made a deal with someone, and what that deal was. Under the right 
circumstances, she could do almost anything.



A little while later, Urd followed a quickly walking Priss as she 
rushed down the hallway out of the building. &quot;Hold on a minute,&quot; Urd 
said. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Priss stopped suddenly, and Urd ran into her, But Priss grabbed her 
and kept them upright. &quot;Were you after me to be a replacement for 
Mara?&quot; Priss asked Urd suddenly.

Urd looked at her, surprised and a little hurt. &quot;No,&quot; she said 
quietly, &quot;I thought you were good looking and that we could have some 
fun together.&quot; She smiled impishly, &quot;And teasing you was very 
enjoyable.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve stopped teasing me so much,&quot; Priss observed, &quot;after we met 
Mara.&quot;

Urd smiled a bit sadly, &quot;My playing around has already hurt someone I 
care about. I&#39;m not going to do it again.&quot;

Priss looked at her intently, then reached out to gently stroke Urd&#39;s 
cheek, &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be playing, if you don&#39;t want it to be.&quot;

Urd looked at her, eyes wide with something like fear. Then she bolted 
down the hall. Priss moved to follow, then stopped, turned and walked 
away.

Sylia watched the events unfold on her security monitor, then turned 
it off with a sigh. &quot;They&#39;re both idiots,&quot; she said disgustedly.

Belldandy looked over at Linna and asked, &quot;Are you all right, with 
what we were talking about out there?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so, Bell,&quot; Linna said, picking up her men&#39;s pajamas and 
walking over to the bathroom to get changed. She was surprised when 
Belldandy stepped up beside her and put her hand on her arm.

&quot;You can change in here if you like,&quot; Belldandy said, blushing 
fiercely. She continued in a rush &quot;You know that Goddesses don&#39;t mind 
such things, and I wanted to...&quot;

Linna shushed her, a finger to her lips. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Bell,&quot; she 
said, and kissed her chastely on the cheek.

She came back in the room to find a fiercely blushing Belldandy in a 
nearly transparent nightie sitting on the bed. She looked like 
somebody&#39;s dream girl, a fantasy come to life. She looked up at Linna 
and smiled bravely, &quot;Do you like it?&quot;

Linna gulped loudly, in the silence of the room. &quot;It looks good,&quot; 
Linna croaked out.

She got up and stood by Linna, determination in her eyes. &quot;Linna,&quot; 
Belldandy asked, &quot;would you like to help me take it off?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Linna admitted softly, &quot;but I want it to mean something, Bell. 
You&#39;re greatful, and that may be clouding your judgement. And there&#39;s 
that wish, too.&quot;

&quot;Linna, over the past few weeks, I&#39;ve gotten to know you. The you 
underneath the tough exterior, the kind, loving, generous woman that 
you are. And I&#39;ve fallen for that woman, even though I didn&#39;t want 
to,&quot; Belldandy said, and kissed Linna, on the lips this time. Linna&#39;s 
arms went around her, and Belldandy sighed happily.

&quot;I don&#39;t have the strength,&quot; Linna said in a husky whisper, &quot;to say no 
to you again.&quot; She kissed Belldandy, weeks of bottled up passion 
coming to the surface, met by a fire just as strong as hers.

Belldandy pushed her gently back, and they fell together on the bed.

Suddenly, the sound of running metal feet and a loud electronic 
beeping is heard. A voice declared, &quot;Punishment mode one!&quot; and they 
were abruptly seperated. Slap! A large rubber stamp hit Linna on the 
forehead!

&quot;You forgot to shut the robot down, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Linna sighed, and 
began rubbing at the word `Hentai&#39; stamped on her head.
