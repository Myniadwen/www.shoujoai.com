<h2>The Storm</h2>
<p>Akane woke at dawn after a night of sleeplessness. She’d <em>tried</em> to rest, but worry over today’s  events had insured that sleep had eluded her.<p>
  It wasn’t that she particularly <em>dreaded</em> the betrothal, or even Shan Pu, but it was still a step in  her life she wasn’t sure she was ready for. She’d just started to admit to  herself that that she was bi, and now, not a week later, she was to be engaged  to another girl… a real girl, one who stayed female full time.<p>
  The people at school had freaked out enough when they  found out she was engaged to Ranma. Most of them still had no clue that he was  the red-head Kuno kept chasing, or that she wasn’t fighting with Ranma as much  as she used to. But she had no idea how she’d hide her betrothal to Shan Pu. Ke  Lun had already enrolled her in Furinkan, and once this betrothal was finished,  Shan Pu would be moving to Japan  with her.<p>
  All of which meant that the very direct Amazon would  make it impossible for her to hide the betrothal anyway.<p>
  What would Yuka and Sayuri, her best friends at  school, say?<p>
  And if that wasn’t enough, she had the Senshi to deal  with. She was going to have a few words with them when she got back. They  should have known telling Zhu Shu about those sensor readings would get her  curious. Zhu Shu had come home from shopping with the Juuban girls last night  and told her she was going to Hong Kong after  the betrothal, so she had one more thing to worry about… (See Curse of the  Banshee for details)<p>
  Finally, giving up on sleep, she stood and stripped  off her pajamas to do a few warm up kata. She watched herself in the mirror as  she did the forms, noting how much her body had changed since she had started  the exercises. She’d always thought she was nice enough looking, but the  stretches and forms she was now doing every day had started smoothing out some  of her curves. Her hips and stomach were becoming more defined and the muscles  on her arms looked softer somehow, though she knew from her workouts that she  hadn’t gotten weaker. Zhu Shu had told her that the further a muscle could  stretch, the stronger it was, and that she did not have to be bulky to be  strong. It looked like she’d been right.<p>
  She fingered her long braid, making the small bells  chime softly, then sat in front of the mirror and concentrated. A long golden  claw of chi sprang from her finger, and she began the morning ritual Zhu Shu  had told her to do to practice control. She only nicked herself twice, neither  of them in a tender spot, and was proud of the fact that she was getting better  at things which took fine motor control. She was still clumsy at times, but she  was getting better.<p>
  She rubbed a little more salve into the almost faded  bruise she’d picked up in practice yesterday, then stood and put on her robe.  She slipped out of her room quietly and went down stairs to gently knock on  Ranma’s door.<p>
  The door slid open a few seconds later to a yawning  Ranma. “Wassup?” he murmured.<p>
  “I can’t sleep. Will you work out with me?”<p>
  He blinked, then smiled. “Yeah. Sure. Let me get  changed.”<p>
  A minute later, the now red-headed girl came out in  her own robe. “Man, I’ll be glad when the dojo is rebuilt.” she muttered.<p>
  Akane gave her a sidelong glance as they went out the  side door. “What’s this? <em>You</em> being <em>modest?</em>”<p>
  They both laughed softly as they entered the garden.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi looked out the kitchen window at the faint  sound of laughter. She’d gotten up early to make a lunch to take along on the  long ride to China,  and wasn’t expecting anyone up for another hour.<p>
  Surprisingly, it was Akane and Ranma. They waved to  her as Akane put her finger to her lips in a hush. Kasumi waved back and went  back to her packing. When she looked out several minutes later, the two girls  had shed the robes and Akane was showing Ranma one of the forms she’d learned  from Zhu Shu. Kasumi smiled. It was so encouraging to see them both working on  something together, even if it was martial arts.<p>
  A movement behind her caught her eye, and she looked  to see Zhu Shu smiling out at the pair too. It was good to see the Chinese girl  smile like that, though it was a bit wistful.   She handed the girl a cup of tea as Zhu Shu yawned and began making  breakfast.<p>
  Kasumi smiled to herself. This morning was starting  off on such wonderful note!<p>
  Pity, really, she had no way of knowing what the  future held…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Some distance away from the Tendo household, Tatewaki  Kuno was also awake. He paced back and forth as he listened to what the house  ninja, Sasuke was telling him.<p>
  “They are both to go to China today with Tao-Ching Hibiki.  I double checked the airport and the Hibiki pilot has filed a flight plan to  someplace called Joketsuzoku. Listed passengers include...” the small ninja  checked his notes.  “…the both of them,  Akane’s family, and the Saotomes. They leave in just a few hours.”<p>
  “What deviltry is this?” Kuno muttered. “No sooner do  I learn of this sorcerous peril to my forest goddess, then do both she and the  beauteous Akane depart for barbaric lands? And with the foul Saotome as well.”  He turned to the small man. “Have you discovered the reason my loves are  descending into such peril?”<p>
  Sasuke blushed. “Ummm… sir… It seems Akane must attend  a betrothal ceremony.”<p>
  “Ah. Well I suppose family obligations must be met.  Which of her family is to be betrothed?”<p>
  Sasuke had hoped he wouldn’t ask that question. “Um… She  is, Master Kuno.”<p>
  “What! My fair Akane is to be betrothed! Never!”<p>
  Sasuke landed on the far side of the room from the  destroyed wall, making a note to repair it later. “But Master, she is already  betrothed to Ranma Saotome!”<p>
  “That is but some trick, some treachery on the part of  the villainous Saotome. Name to me the wretch she is to be forced by her vile  family to betroth, that I might smite him and free her from this foul bondage.”<p>
  Sasuke mentally despaired over the repairs he was  going to have to make to the room after Tatewaki’s careless swipes of his bokken  and answered. “To an Amazon. One Shan Pu.”<p>
  “To a <em>female?</em>”  Kuno asked, his eyes wide.<p>
  “Yes Master Kuno.”<p>
  Kuno placed his hand dramatically to his forehead. “Oh  the vileness of this unnamed Sorcerer, to have condemned both my sister and my  love to such a hideous curse! But despair not, my divine Akane, I, Tatewaki  Kuno, shall guard thee in this terrible time, and once I have slain this  cowardly wizard, I shall be there to grant thee the Kiss of True Love that will  break this evil spell!” He turned to Sasuke. “Prepare the jet! I must away to  the shrine to retrieve the sacred sword of the Kuno’s!”<p>
  “But Master, the Mistress has already departed in the  jet.”<p>
  “Kodachi has taken the jet?”<p>
  “Yes Master, She has already departed for the  airfield. She is leaving for Hong Kong.”<p>
  “Hong Kong? Why is  she going to Hong Kong?”<p>
  “She said something about hunting a Chinese Demon, to  free her beloved Mistress from a Curse.”<p>
  Kuno laughed. “Ah, what a supreme jest! She seeks to  free Akane from the self same Curse, yet she has departed on a wild goose  chase! The gods have smiled upon me! I shall free Akane, and in her  overwhelming gratitude, she shall date with me!”<p>
  The Kuno   Mansion rang with its  Master’s laughter…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The actual trip to China was pretty uneventful. Nodoka  and Kasumi had most everyone prepared before the vans that took them to the air  field arrived, and Tao-Ching’s executive helicopter turned out to be a tilt  rotor airplane with a comfortable cabin, the six alternating rows of seats  facing each other like those on a train with private cabins. Ranma and Akane  spent most of the trip looking out the windows, too uncomfortable in front of  parental figures to talk.<p>
  Zhu Shu spent most of the trip in meditation,  disliking the shuddering and shaking of the flying machine. She had gradually  become used to the glaring lights and the cars and the constant noise of the  Japanese cities, but she hated not being able to feel the energy flows of the  Earth through the metal walls of the aircraft.<p>
  Still, being cut off from the outside made it easier  to focus within…<p>
  She lost all sense of time as she explored along the  links inside her head. Akane was easy to trace, the connection shining and  strong in the absence of external distractions, and it was easy to tell she was  worried, but most of it didn’t seem to center around Ranma or Shan Pu. Her link  to Shan Pu was also bright, if weaker than the one with Akane. She could feel  her blood sister as she dreamed, and then her happiness when she awoke and knew  Akane and Ranma were on their way.<p>
  But it was still the small remnant of her link to Ying-Ying  that drew her attention back over and over, the way a missing tooth would draw  the tongue.<p>
  The strangest part was that it seemed to be growing  stronger as she toyed with it, and the farther she tried to trace along it, the  stronger the faint sense of Ying-Ying’s presence became.  It was already far less tenuous than it had  been when she had first discovered that it had survived.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here, beloved… Always and  forever… I am here.&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  Their arrival at the village broke her meditations  finally and they all piled out of the tilt-wing into the early afternoon sun on  a field just outside of the Amazon village. Ke Lun stood at the edge of the  field with an escort of two young Amazon warriors, one with red hair, one with  green. They fidgeted as Ke Lun stood completely still on her stick, her hair  blowing wildly in the downdraft from the still turning rotors.<p>
  Soun, carefully coached by Tao-Ching, advanced to give  the ritual greetings and acknowledgement of why they had come. He was still  unsure of exactly how he felt about all this, but Tao-Ching and Nodoka had both  explained to him the advantages to his family if he didn’t object, and Akane  had asked him not to as well. It was what she said she wanted.<p>
  As the greetings concluded, the sound of a second  helicopter rose above the falling sound of the slowing rotors, and they turned  to see a chopper with the Kuno family emblem landing. The wheels touched down  and Kuno stepped forth. He struck a dramatic pose and said something that was  lost in the roar of the rotor wash as he pulled a gleaming silver sword and  lifted it in salute…<p>
  The blade intersected the path of the turning rotor  and there was a flash as the blade sheared through the spinning prop. The end  spun away to embed in a tree as a howl rose from the unbalanced rotor. Sasuke  dove out of the chopper, followed by the pilot as the main shaft snapped and  the still-spinning prop plowed into the cockpit. As Kuno replaced his sword in  its sheath, the chopper exploded, creating a dramatic backdrop as he began to  walk towards them.<p>
  “Well, there goes the idea of sending him home.”  Tao-Ching muttered.<p>
  “Who is this madman?” Ke Lun asked in Chinese. “Should  we slay him and put him out of his misery?”<p>
  “He is harmless, mostly, great-grandmother.” Zhu Shu  replied, also in Chinese. “He is simply a fool who believes he loves every  woman, and that therefore every woman must love him. If he gets annoying,  simply knock him unconscious. He has a marvelous constitution and seems to take  little damage from multiple head blows.”<p>
  Ke Lun watched Kuno get up from were Akane had kicked  him when he’d tried to glomp her and nodded. “So I see.”<p>
  Tao-Ching glowered. “I’d better go make sure he stays  out of trouble.” He headed for Tatewaki at a determined pace.<p>
  Zhu Shu and Ke Lun looked after him and nodded. “That  would be wise.” Ke Lun said, noting the appraising looks her two escorts were  giving the swordsman…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu was waiting at the village gate, and waved  enthusiastically at the party. Ranma and Akane looked a little nervous, but it  was Zhu Shu the kawaii Amazon hugged first as they entered.<p>
  “I’m so happy you came!” She said in Chinese. “I  missed you so much.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “I’ve missed you as well. I’m sorry I  missed your other betrothal. I- I needed to work some things out for myself.”<p>
  Shan Pu searched her eyes. “You are still welcome to  join as a sister wife. I have seen Akane’s feelings and yours. I <em>wish</em> you would accept.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No, Shan Pu. I have a  different destiny. Do not fear for me, sister. I am more at peace than I have  been in years. This happiness is for you, though I fear you still have much to  do before it rests secure.”<p>
  Shan Pu grinned mischievously as she switched to  Japanese. “So go best two for three, Akane is prize?”<p>
  Zhu Shu swatted her on the rump as Akane’s eyes grew  huge. Shan Pu eeped, then giggled. “Is only kidding.” She turned smiling eyes  at Akane and Ranma. “Fiancées win Shan Pu fairly.” She hooked an arm to either  of them. “Now Shan Pu proudest warrior in village. Come! Must show off!”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled as the Amazon dragged the two off to  see her village.<p>
  “You seem different, child.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned to see Ke Lun looking off at the  threesome. “Yes, Great- Grandmother.”<p>
  Ke Lun met her gaze for a long moment, searching. “The  shadows behind your eyes are no longer as heavy, great-granddaughter. Have you  then at last laid aside your grief?”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes widened.<p>
  Ke Lun smiled. “Your Grandfather and I have spoken  about you at great length, child. I know about Fei Ying-Ying. I know you have  mourned her all these years. I understand your grief, Little Mouse, and I  sympathize. I am saddened by what occurred. Perhaps if Clan Dragon had not  secluded itself so well, if we had tried harder to… The Amazons view such  things differently. Had you been allowed to sister-wife Ying-Ying, perhaps your  present quest would not be such a burden.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked away. “I- I cannot say, Great-Grandmother.  I do wish she were still here, and yet… in a strange way, I have begun to feel  as if she still is.”<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am always and forever… Here…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  Ke Lun smiled. “Our loved ones are always with us in  our memories.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “This is different  great-grandmother. As I am linked by blood and chi to Shan Pu and Akane, my  link to Ying-Ying remains as well.”<p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow. “Interesting. We will have  to look into that sometime. For now, we must make ready for the betrothal and  our grand celebration.” She nodded towards where many people bustled around the  central square. Zhu Shu nodded and they walked towards the celebration.<p>
  “Yes. Then I must prepare to depart.”<p>
  “So soon, child?” Ke Lun raised an eyebrow.<p>
  “Yes. I- I need to investigate something.”<p>
  Ke Lun stopped, forcing her to stop and turn. “You are  trying to avoid saying something, child. Tell me.” There was no refusing the  command in her voice.<p>
  “I- I must go to Hong Kong.  It seems that old enemies still lurk for Clan Dragon.”<p>
  “Elaborate, Zhu Shu.” Ke Lun’s eyes bored into her.<p>
  “Assassins from Clan Scorpion sought to slay me in Japan. I have  found they came from Lan Tao. Also, there have been… other signs… that Clan Scorpion  may be there. I must go to learn what I may, and perhaps end this threat.” She  avoided telling Ke Lun about the strange negative energy readings Ami’s  computer had detected, knowing Ke Lun would have wanted answers she wouldn’t  give.<p>
  Ke Lun shook her head. “No, Child. You should not. We  have had reports from a sister in Lan Tao that there are mysterious happenings  there recently, and soon, the festival of the Crying Goddess shall occur. It is  too dangerous.”<p>
  “I must go, Great-grandmother. I have made a promise.”<p>
  Ke Lun sighed. “Very well. I cannot force you to break  a promise. I will inform Har Spra to expect you.” She fixed Zhu Shu with a  glare. “And you will report to her, Zhu Shu. She will give you much information  that will help you on Lan Tao.”<p>
  Zhu Shu knew better than to fight that, she’d won her  point. “Yes, Great-grandmother.”<p>
  Silently, the two continued into the square…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>By the time of the ceremonies a few hours later, the  weather had taken a turn for the worse, clouds building as the afternoon sun  crossed the sky. Zhu Shu brought out one of her umbrellas as it looked more and  more like a shower was inevitable. Luckily, the only part of the celebration  not under shelter was the actual ceremony, which would occur on the ancient  dais in the center of the village.<p>
  Ranma looked at the crowd of witnesses filling the  square from under one of the pavilions and muttered. “Nobody made this much  fuss over <em>my</em> betrothal to Shan Pu.”<p>
  “It’s a small village, son-in-law.” Ke Lun said from  behind him. “We don’t get many excuses to party, so we make up for it when we  can.” She cackled. “Just wait until your double wedding.”<p>
  Ranma scratched his head. “Uh, yeah…” He looked around  the square until he saw his dad, setting under a pavilion on the far side of  the square with the other males. He wandered over to find that Tao-Ching was  keeping him, Soun and Kuno occupied with stories and plenty of the Amazons’  sake. He offered Ranma a cup, but was turned down. Ranma hated anything that  dulled his edge.<p>
  Nodoka was sitting with Kasumi and Nabiki in the row  of the seats the Amazons had reserved for the females in front of the dais. As  Ke Lun joined them, the Loremaster ascended the three steps to the dais and  called the square to attention.<p>
  “For three thousand years, the Amazon tribe has held  to its traditions and laws, and we have survived.” She began in Chinese. “Today  we are met to celebrate the following of the law. Shan Pu, daughter of Par  Fume, Champion of the Joketsuzoku tribe, has been defeated by an outlander. By  the laws of the tribe, she has tracked down the one who defeated her, and  betrothed him. She has also met and been defeated by the other fiancée, and has  chosen Love over Death. Today, we celebrate the betrothal of Shan Pu and her  sister-wife, Akane, of Clan Tendo. Let the brides come forward.”<p>
  From the huts to either side, Shan Pu and Akane  stepped forth. Shan Pu wore an ornate form of the normal Amazon battle dress,  and Akane was dressed in a white Mandarin long dress, a gift from Shan Pu. Both  had flowers in their hair, Shan Pu’s odangos wreathed in small white blossoms,  while Akane’s braid bore delicate lavender blooms. Zhu Shu walked behind them  both in a red Mandarin dress bearing a gold dragon spiraling around the skirt,  also a gift from Shan Pu. The three arrived and knelt at the dais to a rumble  of thunder.<p>
  “For a joining of one heart and one mind, two must  learn to love or all is doomed to misery. Shan Pu, daughter of Par Fume,  Champion of the Joketsuzoku, do you come to join in Sistership or Love?”<p>
  Shan Pu beamed. “Both, Revered Loremaster. I have been  bested honorably, and I have surrendered my heart to my conqueror. I seek this  joining for love, and for sistership with the fiancée of the man who has  conquered me as well. With me is my blood-sister, witness to the surrender of  my heart.”<p>
  The Loremaster turned to Zhu Shu. “Song Zhu Shu,  daughter of Song Fa, Child of the Dragon. You have been called as witness. How  speak you?”<p>
  “I stand as witness to my blood-sister’s love, and her  surrender.” Zhu Shu said formally.<p>
  Finally, the Loremaster turned to Akane. “Akane Tendo,  Child of House Tendo. You come as an outsider. Our Champion surrenders her  heart to you for love, and seeks you as both sister-wife and sister-mate, how  speak you?”<p>
  For a long moment, Akane said nothing, and the silence  grew oppressive, then she spoke. “I accept Shan Pu’s declaration of love. I  cannot say that I love her in return yet, but for the love she bears me, and  the love she bears Ranma, and the love I bear for him as well, I accept. I hope  that time will allow me to learn to love her as she does me.”<p>
  The Loremaster smiled as approval noises came from the  crowd. “Fairly spoken child, and from the heart. Shan Pu, Daughter of Par Fume.  Rise and stand. Akane Tendo. Rise and stand. From this day forward, you are  pledged to one another, as sister-wives and sister-mates. May fortune and  happiness await.” She struck her staff three times against the dais as she  cried. “Heard and witnessed!”<p>
  The Amazons cheered loudly just as the rain began to  fall.<p>
  Zhu Shu’s umbrella snapped open to cover herself and Shan  Pu before the first raindrops hit. She turned to invite Akane under it as well,  but instead froze in horror as, with the first rain droplets touch, Akane  vanished, her gown collapsing inward on vacant air.<p>
  She and Shan Pu screamed Akane’s name simultaneously,  then dodged the Loremaster’s staff as it fell forward. With horrified eyes, Zhu  Shu saw that everyone in the square who had been touched by the rain had  disappeared, leaving only clothes behind…<p>
  The rain ended as abruptly as it had started as from all  around the square horrified cries arose.<p>
  Shan Pu knelt, weeping to touch the dress as Ranma  charged towards the dais from the pavilion. Before Shan Pu’s hand touched the  dress, a movement began, and a pink rabbit emerged from the neck of Akane’s  gown. Large frightened eyes stared at Shan Pu and Zhu Shu.<p>
  “A-Akane?” Shan Pu’s question was a strangled whisper.<p>
  The pink bunny nodded, long ears trembling.<p>
  Ranma arrived to see the bunny and bolted off again.  Genma and Soun sat in the front rows holding small bundles of fur to their  chests and weeping. Amazons stared in wonder as rabbits began climbing out of  piles of clothing.<p>
  Ranma reappeared with a kettle of hot water. “I  thought you had to fall into a spring to get cursed,” he said with a smile  holding up the steaming kettle. “Now you get to learn how it feels too. My  fiancée, the rabbit.” Water poured down on the glaring rabbit.<p>
  But Akane didn’t change.<p>
  An old rabbit hopped next to Akane and scratched out  ideograms in the dirt. Zhu Shu leaned over to read them.<p>
  “The <em>Chisuitton</em>?”  She looked at Ranma. “She say magic rain. Cursed water.” She looked back to the  rabbit. “Why water no change?”<p>
  The rabbit pointed to the first symbol and scratched  out more ideograms.<p>
  “She say <em>Chisuitton</em> lock curse. No can change!” Zhu Shu raised horrified eyes to Shan Pu and Ranma  as a commotion began by the village gates. Warning horns sounded across the  village as warriors dropped the rabbits they had been collecting and ran.<p>
  Shan Pu looked desperately at Zhu Shu and Ranma. “Village  is attacked. Many warriors rabbits. Need help!”<p>
  Ranma looked at all the rabbits scrambling to get out  of the able warrior’s way and nodded. “I’ll get Pop and Mr. Tendo and catch up.  Go!”<p>
  Zhu Shu and Shan Pu ran towards the gate, barely  pausing long enough for Shan Pu to grab up her bon buri. They arrived at the  gates to find dozens of rabbits amid scattered weapons as the defenders tried  to stem the tide of black clad men with wineskins. Shan Pu screamed in rage as  they saw another Amazon warrior sprayed with water and turned into an animal . She  threw a spray of darts as Zhu Shu scurried into the crowd, swords slashing  wineskins. She ignored the rips as her long dress tore in a dozen places as she  weaved through the invaders, leaving a wake of surprised hares.<p>
  Then, she tried to dive out of the way as a cloud of  throwing darts came at her, but the shredded dress got in her way. She found  herself pinned to a wall by the darts as a small boy with a wolf eared hood and  blue hair calmly stepped out of the chaos.<p>
  “Well, you’re fast, but not very smart.” He leered. “Still,  I think I can have lots of fun with you. Not many girls can handle my speed.”  He reached out to fondle a breast.<p>
  “Pig!” Zhu Shu spat. “How dare you!”<p>
  The small boy laughed. “I am Mint, of the Musk  Dynasty! We are the rulers of all!” He traced a knife down the front of Zhu Shu’s  dress, the sharp blade parting the cloth easily as it barely touched her skin. “And  you are a mere woman. You Amazons need to learn your places. You exist only to  serve us.”<p>
  “I am not an Amazon. And I do not serve you!” Zhu Shu  screamed, throwing herself at the boy and trying to break the hold the darts  had on her clothes. The cut down her front tore further as she ripped her arms  out of the shredded sleeves. She staggered forward as the small boy danced to  the side. He leered further at her nude state.<p>
  “So, you have some strength as well. Good. I’m going  to enjoy teaching you how to please me.”<p>
  Zhu Shu took a stance, her eyes narrowing. “I am not  any man’s play toy, pig. Especially not the likes of you.”<p>
  The boy smiled as he drew a saber. “So, you would  challenge one with the speed of the wolf?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled grimly. “I am Clan Dragon, Musk  Warrior. We <em>are</em> speed.”<p>
  The boys smile faltered slightly as Zhu Shu struck. “You  are her…” he said as he blocked her thrust, then reposted.<p>
  Zhu Shu ignored the stares and reactions of the  warriors around her beyond a grim smile that their distraction made them easy  targets for the Amazons as she began pouring her chi into speed and shifted to  combat time. She had hated his type of behavior from Sung Li. There was no way  she’d put up with it from this runt! She’d show him what real speed was!<p>
  Her smile slipped slightly as she realized he was  still matching her thrust for thrust. As the world slowed around them, they  began to duel in earnest…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu threw her last spray of darts as a huge man in  tiger striped armor shoved aside the troops crowding the gate and hiding from  the Amazons’ darts and arrows. “Cowards!” he yelled. “They’re only women! Rush  them! Show them the folly of presuming to be more than our playthings!”<p>
  Shan Pu growled. She remembered that huge shape. She’d  never seen him clearly, but he had been there when Herb had humiliated her, and  he had been the one…<p>
  “Stand aside cousin.” A voice behind her said as a  hand was laid on her shoulder. She turned to see Tao-Ching, hatred burning in  his eyes. “He’s mine.”<p>
  She stepped aside as he stepped out in to the fray  before the gate. “Lime! I warned you what would happen if you ever dared attack  the Joketsuzoku again!” He called.<p>
  The tiger man’s eyes turned to focus on the smaller,  but no less brawny man. “Tao-Ching.” he said as his eyes narrowed. “I see I  didn’t break you sufficiently. What makes you think you have any chance against  me this time?”<p>
  Tao-Ching held up a water skin. “This.” he smiled as  he tensed his arms and the skin shredded, water cascading down…<p>
  Lime lost his sneering grin as a thousand pounds of  snarling smilodon launched itself at him.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The sound of a snarling cat echoed across the battle  field to where Ranma had arrived with his dad and Soun, but he was too engaged  to really notice. He had entered the area in front of the gate and immediately  gotten swirled into the mad melee. Red rage burned across his sight as he  dodged the knives and swords - rage at what the battle field had shown him.<p>
  It had been the first attacker he’d fought - the one  he’d  nearly killed - who’d made him so  angry, who had driven him to this rage. The one who’d been laughing as he  stepped on a rabbit, laughing as he killed the transformed Amazon. It had been  the glee in that laugh that had sparked the fire that burned in him, that made  him wish he could get the image out of his mind, that had made him respond so  violently. When the man had attacked him, Ranma had deflected his sword thrust  into his own leg and left him frantically attempting to stem the flow of  blood.  The thrust wasn’t likely to be  fatal, but a half inch to the inside of his thigh and it would have been.<p>
  Part of him, a part that stood back and observed  everything told him that he hadn’t fatally wounded anyone, though it couldn’t  deny that his mercy wasn’t shared by the Amazons.  He found that as much as that would have  bothered him normally, he just couldn’t bring himself to object. He couldn’t  get the scream the rabbit had made as the man had broken her neck out of his  head, and in his mind images of a pink haired rabbit imposed itself under the  man’s foot. He broke the arm of the man he was fighting in passing.<p>
  It wasn’t fair! Why did this stuff have to happen to  him? Why, when he had just started to learn he loved Akane, did she have to  have this happen? Why had these men come and turned her into a rabbit?<p>
  White fire burned across his shoulder from a sword thrust  and he backed away from a group of fighters into a clear area. A snarl made him  turn, fear chilling him to the core.<p>
  The big Musk Warrior was battered and bloody, but  still on his feet and attempting to strangle the big cat. The observer knew the  smilodon was Tao-Ching, but it made no difference. Black fear skittered across  his consciousness. The sounds of dying rabbits merged with the howls of the  angry cat as the observer retreated away from the rising animal rage. His last  conscious thought as the Neko-ken consumed him was to hope he would remember to  protect the rabbits…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Shan Pu yowled in fury as she clawed at the ankles of  a passing black clad attacker. She had been caught by Tao-Ching’s water shower,  and as a result, she was now worse than useless in the aid of her village. She  darted across the open space to a wall and clawed her way up the side of a hut.  Maybe if she could get higher, she could jump on somebody…<p>
  From the roof, she could see over the village wall,  where hundreds more of the black clad attackers harried the wall’s defenders  and attempted to pour through the gates; Tao-Ching at least was helping there.  His fight with the giant blocked the gate effectively enough that only a few  managed to pass.<p>
  She spied a red clad whirlwind sending people flying  and smiled as Ranma proved his prowess to the Amazons. No-one would question  her loss to him after this.<p>
  She jumped across the space between two huts, narrowly  clearing the wide gap and looked down at a posturing Kuno.<p>
  “Villains! Assassins! Feel the Wrath of Blue Thunder!”<p>
  He was an idiot, but she did have to admire his skill  with the sword, even sheathed as it was. A trail of unconscious bodies lay  behind his push into the gate field.<p>
  She scampered across a line over a group of her  sisters, noting with approval the pathway they were paving in blood. The  villains were paying for the harm they had caused her sisters in the only coin  Amazons accepted.<p>
  She dodged a sword that spun towards her, the hand  gripping it trailing blood, and reached the peak of the tallest roof by the  gate. There, she stopped, her eyes focusing on a rapidly moving blur.<p>
  Zhu Shu was being hard pressed by a small male in a  wolf eared hood. She was unwounded, but Shan Pu could tell she was angry. And  nude. A quick scan of the battlefield revealed her dress pinned to a wall by  several daggers. Shan Pu hissed. She’d spent days embroidering the dragon on  the dress. She headed for the battle between the two.<p>
  She concentrated as she moved, meowing as she shifted  towards the speed with which the two duelists were moving. She watched as Zhu  Shu did a leap that took her nearly thirty feet into the air, her ribbons  lashing down in a move she’d seen from the receiving end a few times, but her  eyes widened as she saw the size of the chi ball Zhu Shu unleashed.<p>
  The small boy sheared the ball in two on his blade,  the energy sliding to either side and destroying the roof he was standing on.  He laughed as he dodged the next few blasts Zhu Shu unleashed from where she  was hovering, not caring that they caught his own troops instead.<p>
  “You’re good, bitch. But you will still pleasure me  before I’m done with you.”<p>
  Shan Pu shook her head. Something wasn’t right about  this. How did the Musk get so powerful? And why was the Musk soldier acting  like that? She remembered how they had acted when she was thirteen. They had  been fascinated that she was a female, and even though Herb had cheated when  they fought, and might have even beaten her if Tao-Ching hadn’t showed up, they  had at least respect for her as a warrior.<p>
  She jumped across to another roof as the Musk warrior  landed on it. “Give it up, girl. Xi’an Chi protected us from Amazon magic, and  I am your better in speed. You can’t win.” His grin made Shan Pu’s skin crawl.<p>
  Zhu Shu landed on a pole top, her ribbons lashing. “Never.”<p>
  The small man laughed. “I like your spirit. I’m going  to have fun breaking you. Maybe I’ll train you to walk on all fours at the end  of my leash.”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes burned with green fire as her ribbons  began to shimmer gold. They danced out in a whirlwind, only to bounce off a  shimmering barrier. The Musk laughed again and held up a small amulet on a  leather thong. “I told you, you can’t touch me. This charm shields me from your  magic.”<p>
  A small bundle of pink and purple fur hurled itself  from the roof peak behind him and four sets of claws dug into his arm as Shan  Pu bit down on the amulet. The boy screamed and threw her violently away. She  yowled as she flew against the roof peak. The short man loomed above her, his sword  raised. “Damn cat!” His sword started to descend.<p>
  A golden ribbon lashed out to impale his wrist,  followed by a second across the back of his knees. He screamed as his legs  collapsed, then gave a low groan as Zhu Shu’s pommel connected with the back of  his head. Shan Pu looked up to see Zhu Shu, glaring down at the unconscious  figure.<p>
  “Arrogant dog.”<p>
  Shan Pu looked down to the amulet she had torn out of  the boy’s hand and nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after tying up the unconscious  boy, they looked out over the village.<p>
  “This is not good.” Zhu Shu muttered. The Amazons were  making a brave fight, but they were sorely outnumbered, and even the aid of the  Nerima crew wasn’t preventing the slow advance of the black clad troops. The  Amazons had lost too many of the best warriors to the cursed water.<p>
  An old rabbit with white fur kicked her in the leg to  get her attention, then hopped down to an alley between huts. She followed the  rabbit down and placed Shan Pu on the ground. The rabbit was scratching  ideograms in the dirt. Zhu Shu read them and looked at the rabbit wide eyed.<p>
  “Jusenkyo is two days away! Great-grandmother, even at  my fastest, I could only make it in a day!”<p>
  The rabbit scratched further symbols. Zhu Shu looked  at them and shook her head. “I have never done that before. I don’t know how to  do that.” She read the symbols Ke Lun continued to write and nodded  uncertainly. “I will try, Great-grandmother.”<p>
  She looked around the corner to the battle. It was  becoming increasingly obvious the Amazons were losing slowly. Ke Lun was right;  there was no other way, and no one else who could have even a hope of  succeeding.<p>
  She debated grabbing one of the outfits littering the  ground, but decided she couldn’t waste the time, so she leaped to the top of  the outer wall as she opened all her chi paths to their fullest.<p>
  The world around her slowed to a crawl as she stepped  past a slow moving arrow. She leaped down onto the head of a black trooper and  stepping stoned her way across the waiting men. At the edge of their group, she  headed off down the path towards Jusenkyo.<p>
  Still, time was passing too quickly. She set herself  to her fastest pace and concentrated on moving faster. Time began moving slower  still and the air took on the feeling of a clinging liquid. She split her chi  into a shield around her as Ke Lun had instructed and began to pour more and  more into making herself move faster and faster.<p>
  She ran across a frozen landscape viewed through  distorted glass. She passed leaves frozen in mid air, crossed streams of solid  water, leaped up the spray of a frozen waterfall. Chi poured through her in  rivers, in oceans, and still she drew it in and poured it into her speed. She  ignored the fire in her legs, the acid each breath became, and concentrated  only on moving faster, every second passing being one too many for someone at  the village.<p>
  The chi within her burned like a star, yet eventually,  it began to falter. As she approached the Jusenkyo springs she felt the  beginnings of it’s exhaustion. She pushed the thought from her mind as she  stopped in front of the Guide’s hut and time slammed back into motion.<p>
  A small girl peeked out of the hut after the gale that  accompanied Zhu Shu had washed over it. She stared at the naked state Zhu Shu  was in and asked wide eyed. “Who are you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu knelt and tried to get enough breath to talk. “I  seek the Guide. I must get water from the spring of drowned girl or the Amazons  are doomed.”<p>
  The girl stared at her.<p>
  “Please,” Zhu Shu begged. “I have no time; every  second I delay may mean more deaths.”<p>
  The girl nodded and seemed to come to a decision. “I  am his daughter, Plum. I can show you the  spring.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stood on wobbly legs. “I thank you. I will  need a couple of water skins if you have them.”<p>
  The girl nodded and vanished into the hut, reappearing  a few seconds later with a pair. “This way.” She led Zhu Shu into the pools.<p>
  Five minutes later, with two skins full of water, she  began her run back, but barely a fourth of the way there, she felt as her chi  finally reached exhaustion. Desperately, she reached out, searching with her  mind for another source, another way of achieving her quest. Somehow, she had  to find a way; she had to get to the Amazon village.<p>
  And something responded to that need…<p>
  In a flash of golden light, Zhu Shu disappeared.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“I can’t believe those girls.” Luna said irritated. “To  go off and leave us here, and break their promise.”<p>
  Artemis looked up from where he was rubbing a sore  spot. “Yeah, and get us stuck by the vet too” He looked around the room. “I  should claw up the sheets or something. Serve Usagi right.”<p>
  “Artemis!” Luna chided.<p>
  “I know, I know. I’m annoyed and in pain. It makes me  catty!”<p>
  Luna groaned at the pun, then gasped. She and Artemis  both turned and stared off in the direction they had felt the surge from.<p>
  “Zhu Shu?” Luna said softly…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Further south, the wizard turned from the young red  haired American he was talking to and stared off to the north. The girl trailed  off when she noticed she had lost his attention and looked at him in  puzzlement.<p>
  “Xi’an  Chi?”<p>
  He focused on her for a second. “We’ll continue this  later, Alice. I  have something I must check on.”<p>
  The girl blinked at the retreating back of the masked  Chinese man. She’d never seen him so distracted…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On an airplane just coming in to land in Hong Kong, a short beep came from Ami’s minicomputer, but  it was lost in the roar of the jet engines.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>With the flash of light, Zhu Shu had felt herself  falling. She had landed just a second later, but it took her eyes a second to  recover from the dazzle. Then her jaw dropped in shock.<p>
  She was standing in the middle of the dais where Shan  Pu and Akane had gotten betrothed.<p>
  An anxious Shan Pu whirled around from where she stood  next to the pink rabbit that was Akane.   Zhu Shu smiled weakly at her surprise, answering her unspoken  question.  “I don’t know. I have the  water. How long?”<p>
  Shan Pu gaped in shock.  “Just over ten minutes. They fired the huts  by the gate, but we still hold.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Then I have not failed?” She fell to  her knees, too weary to stand as the world spun around her.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt; No, my love, you did not fail…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  Then there was only the scent of cherry blossoms…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The fighting by the gate had become bloody. Faced with  odds too great to overcome, they had been forced to stop pulling punches or  sword strokes. Tao-Ching had finally felled the giant Lime and was doing his  best to hold the gate against the invaders, aided by a yowling Ranma. Genma and  Soun, both bloody, worked to save animals from the battlefield.  Kuno, pressed from all sides by attackers  seeking his life had gone into a trance state. Like clockwork, an invader fell  with every stroke he made.<p>
  Then, a volley of arrows from behind the defenders cut  down the first rows of the attackers, and with a howling war cry, a horde of  naked Amazon warriors charged into the fray.<p>
  Every one sporting rabbit ears and tails…<p>
  Kuno stood, his jaw dropped in amazement.<p>
  “It’s the attack of the kawaii bunny girls.” A dryly  amused voice said from beside him. He turned to see an equally naked Nabiki  standing next to him, also with rabbit ears and a bunny tail.<p>
  It was too much; with blood gushing from his nose, he  fainted.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>With the arrival of the fresh warriors, the battle  turned. The savage Amazon warriors took their anger out on the attackers for  daring to turn them into cute sextoys. As the last of the attackers fled, a  cheer arose from the defenders, but attention was quickly diverted to putting  out the fires and recovering their dead.<p>
  As the sun set, twenty one women lay on the dais,  returned at least to partial humanity by the last of the cursed water. A tall,  young looking woman with long black hair and ears stood before the assembled  tribe, clutching the cane she had used to defend her village as it’s Warleader.  She solemnly spoke to the still living as one by one, they were covered.<p>
  Nabiki turned from where she watched to the rest of  the people in the large hut.<p>
  “I don’t see Zhu Shu out there, so she must still be  sleeping.”<p>
  Shan Pu, sitting close to Akane and looking worriedly  at the black haired boy curled up in Akane’s lap purring, nodded.  “She very tired. Faint from exhaustion. She  very big hero. Bring water to turn people back.”<p>
  Nabiki nodded and sat down cross-legged next to where  Kasumi happily tended a fire, cooking them all dinner. She didn’t seem to mind  the long ears poking up through her hair in the slightest. Nabiki squirmed,  trying to get her tail comfortable. “Or at least <em>mostly</em> back.” She grumbled.<p>
  “Great-grandmother tells why still part rabbit.”<p>
  “Yeah, yeah. I know. The curses combined, so we are  all cursed by the spring of drowned bunny girl.” She sighed, then gave a wry  grin. “Well, if nothing else, we’re assured high paying careers as exotic models.”<p>
  “Oh, my.” Kasumi said with a blush.<p>
  The laughter lightened the mood, and drew a “merrrrow”  from Ranma. Nodoka looked at him and turned to Genma. “What <em>I </em>want to know is what has happened to  my son.”<p>
  Genma looked around for a place to hide, but stopped  at the sound of steel being slid out of its sheath. “Um, well, dear, you see.”<p>
  “What have you done to our son, Genma?”<p>
  “Yes, why Ai Ren act like cat?” Shan Pu added.<p>
  Unable to escape, Genma settled down into a cross  legged position and pushed his glasses up his nose. “It began when I sought to  teach him the ‘Neko-ken.’ Ever since the training, he has feared cats, and only  when his fear overwhelms him can he use the secrets of that deadly art.” He  glanced at the purring boy on Akane’s lap. “When his fear destroys his reason,  he becomes a cat, and until now, only a little old lady in the neighborhood we  stayed in before going to China could bring him out.”<p>
  “And why would this training affect him so?” Nodoka  prompted.<p>
  Genma settled into his righteous indignation pose. “As  I told you ten years ago, dear, a mother’s love would interfere with his  training.”<p>
  A sword set its edge against his neck. “And I told you  the jury was still out on you, Genma. Answer my question.”<p>
  Genma eyed the razor sharp steel and gulped. “According  to the training manual, you have to tie fish sausage to a student and drop him  into a pit of hungry cats.”<p>
  A collective gasp of disbelief rose around the room.  Soun muttered, “How rigorous!”<p>
  Genma continued. “Unfortunately, it was a failure. I tried  fish sausage, fish jerky, fish paste, but nothing worked. All that it  accomplished was to give him this phobia of cats.”<p>
  “How <em>could</em> you?” Nodoka asked, looking at her son in pity.<p>
  “Ranma scared <em>all</em> cats?” Shan Pu asked in a small voice.<p>
  “All cats.” Genma confirmed.<p>
  “What if small harmless kitten-type cat?”<p>
  “It makes no difference. From the smallest kitten to  the largest tiger, he fears them equally.”<p>
  “You did to Ai Ren!” Shan Pu screamed shaking Genma by  the collar. “You fix!”<p>
  “I… can’t…” Genma said between shakes. “I… tried… when…  I… found… out… was… a… trick…”<p>
  “Trick!” Shan Pu shrieked, letting him go as she fell  back on her rump in shock.<p>
  “A trick. It wasn’t until I read the next page of the  training manual that I found out that it was given as an example of what <em>not</em> to do. I’ve tried every thing to try  and break him of his fear. I’ve locked him into his room with a bag of them, in  a cage with them; I’ve even thrown him into a lion’s den. Nothing works!”<p>
  “How could you do that to your own son?!” Akane  yelled.<p>
  “Yes, Mr. Tendo, you went too far, even for martial  arts training!” Kasumi chided.<p>
  Everyone stared at her in shock.<p>
  “Shan Pu find way to fix, Ai Ren. No must be afraid of  cat.” Shan Pu told the sleeping Ranma quietly before she exited the hut.<p>
  “Humm.” Nabiki muttered. “Well, one has to wonder as  to why <em>she’s</em> so upset.”<p>
  “Yeah, well I don’t think <em>either</em> of us is really pleased about that.” Akane said, giving  Genma a dark look.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“We must press them now.” Ke Lun told the other elders  meeting in her hut after the gathering in the square. “If we allow them to  regroup, they will only attack again.”<p>
  “We have lost too many warriors, Ke Lun. We have too  few to guard both our walls and send out a force such as you propose.” Lo Shen  said, her ears twitching agitatedly. Like Ke Lun, she had been restored to  youth as a bunny girl. Fully three quarters of the other elders were similarly  afflicted by the initial shower.<p>
  “Yet if we allow Herb time to regroup, he will simply  hire more of these mercenaries. Only the giant and the small one Zhu Shu  defeated are Musk! All the others bore this mark!” Ke Lun tossed a piece of  paper on the table with a drawing of the tattoo all the black clad attackers  had on the left shoulder.<p>
  “I do not believe the <em>Musk</em> hired these men, Revered Warleader.” A weary voice said from  the sleeping loft over Ke Lun’s head. “Forgive my intrusion, elders, but I  could not help but overhear.” Zhu Shu said as she climbed down the ladder.<p>
  The Loremaster nodded. “Clan Dragon is always welcome  at Council, Zhu Shu.” Several other elders nodded.<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow, then bowed shakily. “You  honor me.”<p>
  “You have seen something, child?” Ke Lun asked.<p>
  “I have no gift for visions, Great-grandmother, beyond  my sight for auras. But I know that sign.” She pointed to the piece of paper. “I  fear very much that you have lost warriors today because of me. I know of no  other reason you would have been attacked by warriors of Clan Scorpion, save  that I was here.”<p>
  The Loremaster shook her head. “No, child. We have  skirmished with the Scorpion Tong before. They have tried to acquire herbs, magic,  and lore that we posses. They have not succeeded before, they did not this  time. The only surprise is that they joined with the Musk and that their leader  gave the Musk wards against magic, yet did not grant his own troops the same  protection.”<p>
  “Yet the Scorpion have attempted to assassinate me in  Japan. I fear they traced me to here and-“<p>
  “Nonsense. This attack was too prepared to have been  set up in the last week.” The Loremaster smiled gently. “Be at peace child.  Your actions today saved our village. For that we are grateful. Do not blame  yourself for those you could not save. And fear no more for assassins in Japan.  We shall send two of our finest warriors with Ke Lun and Shan Pu to see to your  safety.”<p>
  Ke Lun held up her hand. “No. I will take Ling-Ling  and Lung-Lung. The Dragon’s Child is equal to any of our best warriors. She can  defend herself from most harm, and I must finish their training anyway, as well  as see to my new son and daughter in law’s training. She will be safe.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, knowing it was useless to argue. She  should have known becoming Shan Pu’s blood-sister had its drawbacks. Plus, the  Amazons seemed to hold Clan Dragon in some esteem, so her being the last of the  Clan meant she had to be protected. At least Ke Lun had prevented the  Loremaster from sending two adult warriors to loom over her all the time. And  Ke Lun had already agreed she had to go to Hong Kong.<p>
  “Anyway, you stated you did not believe the Musk hired  Scorpion. I would agree.” Ke Lun said. “I believe they have taken over the  Musk. The two warriors with the Scorpion troops do not behave as they have in  the past. They have no <em>honor</em> anymore.  We must investigate, and wipe out this infestation if what I suspect is true.  We cannot allow the Scorpion access to the Musk’s legacy, and we must recover  the <em>Kaisufuu</em>!”<p>
  “And again, I would tell you we do not have the  warriors.” The Loremaster stated.<p>
  “Your pardon again, Revered elders.” Zhu Shu said as  she bowed once more. “But you do not stand alone in the need for the <em>Kaisufuu</em>.”<p>
  The Loremaster blinked. “You speak of the Outlanders?”<p>
  “Yes, Revered elder. They have aided in the defense of  Joketsuzoku, and they have shared in this curse. I believe if you but ask, they  will lend their aid.”<p>
  Ke Lun grinned. “Indeed.” She looked to the  Loremaster. “The Dragon has given you a solution. Will you not listen?”<p>
  The Loremaster blushed. “You are correct, Warleader. I  will listen. Will you ask the Outlanders to aid us in this?”<p>
  Ke Lun laughed, a far cry from her usual cackle. “Honestly,  I think we would have a hard time stopping them from coming.”<p>
  The elders nodded as the Loremaster said “If nothing  else, it will be the first test of our marriage alliance.” She stood and bowed  to Zhu Shu. “Our thanks for you wisdom, Child of the Dragon.” She turned to the  others. “If there is nothing else, I suggest we conclude. We have disturbed our  rescuer’s sleep enough, and there is much to prepare for tomorrow. Ke Lun, you  may take twenty warriors with you as well as any of the Outlanders who wish to  accompany you. I will pray to the Ancestors for your success.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded and began putting the tea cups on a tray  as the other elders filed out. As the door closed behind her, she turned to Zhu  Shu. “Thank you. I was afraid I was going to have to argue with her all night.  She had no choice but to listen to you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu bobbed her head. “I apologize for the rudeness  of interrupting the elders meeting, but I still fear the village is in danger  so long as I am here.”<p>
  “Everywhere is in danger from the Scorpion, Zhu Shu. I  don’t know why they tried to assassinate you in Japan, but we are not strangers to  their depredations.”<p>
  “Yet so long as they seek me, those around me are in  danger.”<p>
  “Child, if you say that we would be safer if you left  us all and hid yourself away, I will turn you over my knee and paddle you like  a child. That is a child’s solution, Little Mouse, to run away. It would be a  disservice to your friends, your family and your loved ones. Do they know of  the attempt on your life?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Not all of them.”<p>
  “Do Akane and Ranma know?”<p>
  “Yes. And Kasumi. She was with me when they attacked.  I was forced to kill them to save her life. Nabiki found out later and it was  she who told me where the assassins were from. No-one else of the Tendos or  Saotomes knows.”<p>
  “And Shan Pu?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked away. “I have not told her yet.”<p>
  “Yet you will go to Hong Kong  alone.”<p>
  “I only seek to investigate. I have means to summon  aid if needed.”<p>
  Ke Lun sighed. “I cannot command you not to do this,  Zhu Shu, anymore than I can command you not to accompany us tomorrow. I am  honored to call you great granddaughter, but I do not rule you. But please, for  the love I have for you, be careful. I want to see both yours and Shampoo’s  children’s children some day; I cannot do that if you throw your life away in a  misguided effort not to endanger us.”<p>
  Zhu Shu lowered her head. “I swear I will do my best  to stay out of danger when I may.” she said tiredly<p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “I suppose I must be satisfied with  that.”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s soft snore was the only answer she got.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“So, she has escaped today.” Xi’an Chi noted.<p>
  “Yes, Master. But my spies confirm that they have  taken the secondary bait. They will come here tomorrow. Everything is prepared  for them. She will not escape a second time.” The shadowy figure in his scrying  mirror said.<p>
  Xi’an Chi nodded. “She had better not. She has begun  to access some of those cursed Senshi powers, though she doesn’t know how to  control them. I curse the day Serenity gave her those swords and that wand. Between  them they have more tricks than ten thousand magicians. Do not allow the seals  on the trap to be broken once she has been caught or she may find a way of  slipping free.”<p>
  “I will not fail, Master. No weapon forged by man may  harm me.”<p>
  “Make sure of it, or I will give you to Chaos as a  play toy.”<p>
  “You need not worry, Master. By this time tomorrow,  The Dragon’s Child will be <em>yours.</em>”</p>
