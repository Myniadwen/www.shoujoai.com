<p><em>For too long now, there were secrets in my mind.</em><br />
  <em>For too long now, there were things I should have said.</em><br />
  <em>In the darkness, I was stumbling for the door.</em><br />
  <em>To find a reason, to find the time, the place, the hour.</em><br />
  <em>Waiting for the winter sun, and the cold light of day.</em><br />
  <em>The misty ghosts of childhood fears... </em><br />
  <em>The pressure is building, and I can’t stay away.</em></p>
<p><em>I throw myself, into the sea.  </em><br />
  <em>Release the wave, let it wash over me.  </em><br />
  <em>To face the fear, I once believed.</em><br />
  <em>The tears of the dragon, for you and for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Where I was, I had wings that couldn’t fly.</em><br />
  <em>Where I was, I had tears I couldn’t cry.</em><br />
  <em>My emotions, frozen in an icy lake.</em><br />
  <em>I couldn’t feel them, until the ice began to break.</em></p>
<p><em>I have no power over this, you know I’m afraid.</em><br />
  <em>The walls I built are crumbling.</em><br />
  <em>The water is moving.</em><br />
  <em>I’m slipping away.</em></p>
<p><em>I throw myself, into the sea.</em><br />
  <em>Release the wave, let it wash over me.</em><br />
  <em>To face the fear I once believed.</em><br />
  <em>The tears of the dragon, for you and for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Slowly I awake.</em><br />
  <em>Slowly I rise.</em><br />
  <em>The walls I built are crumbling,</em><br />
  <em>The water is moving,</em><br />
  <em>I’m slipping away.</em></p>
<p><em>I throw myself, into the sea.</em><br />
  <em>Release the wave, let it wash over me.</em><br />
  <em>To face the fear, I once believed.</em><br />
  <em>The tears of the dragon, for you and for me.</em></p>

<h2>Rendezvous with Ranma</h2>
<p>Day broke over the bowl-shaped valley, and turned the  morning fog to gold.</p><p>
  Birds began their morning rituals of greeting the sun  as the warmth began dissipating the mists, revealing a landscape dotted with  numerous small pools. Bamboo poles stood among the pools, like silent sentinels  over the strangely still valley. No animals came to the water to drink; no  birds flew down to bathe, only the wind played over the pools. The wind... and  a lone figure that danced from pole to pole as she flowed through sword forms.<strong> </strong></p><p>
  The figure casually balanced on a pole as the slender,  curved blades of her twin swords flashed through a complicated form before she  effortlessly moved through the air to land on another pole. She stood  motionless in the final stance, a sculpture of leashed energy frozen in time,  radiating an aura of vibrant life even in her stillness.</p><p>
  As the long ribbons attached to her swords settled  around her, the figure gave a soft sigh and opened her eyes, looking around the  still and empty valley.  She had come to  Jusenkyo a week earlier, hoping the training ground would test her skills, yet  she had found none of the monsters, vengeful spirits, or any of the hundred  other dangers the white-haired storyteller had claimed could be found there;  only the silent pools and the wind. Even the guide’s small hut had been empty.</p><p>
  She had set her small camp by a freshwater spring on  the cliffs overlooking the valley and explored the area, but had found nothing  to explain the training ground’s evil reputation. The cliffs her grandfather  had trained her on were far more deadly than the bamboo poles, and they had  nothing as soft as water to land in after a fall. Starting her practice on the  morning of her second day, she had instead found the quiet valley to be a  perfect place to reflect on her failed quest. The solitude and the daily  rituals had been calming as she contemplated what awaited on her return to her  home village.</p><p>
  Finishing yet another form, she vainly tried to think  of a way out. The thought of returning home a failure burned deeply, but there  was nowhere in China  she had not searched. As much as she hated it, the only honorable thing left  was to return to her village and accept her fate. She sighed heavily. If only  she had been male. Maybe her aunt wouldn’t have resented her so much. Maybe Ying-Ying...</p><p>
  She savagely cut off the thought as she started a new  form, leaping to another pole, her hair streaming behind her as she flowed  through the air to land softly on a bamboo perch ten feet away, the sole of her  red shoe making no more noise than the whisper of her swords as she moved  through the Opening Fan and into Summer Raindrops. Her short, tight, sleeveless  cheongsam clung to her like a second skin, leaving no loose folds of cloth to  catch her arms or blades. The short skirt left her legs free to propel her into  a leap that, after a twist in midair, landed her on yet another pole forty feet  deeper into the grounds. The long ribbons trailing from her sword hilts danced  around her like living snakes, their coils never touching or getting in the way  as her swords flew through Hummingbird Kisses the Rose.</p><p>
  Sighing again, she concluded the form and let the  ribbons settle. She’d improved her skills immensely in the last year, but that  was meaningless. She’d failed in her quest for a husband she considered worthy  of giving her an heir to Clan Dragon.</p><p>
  She could already feel her aunt’s eyes on her,  gloating. She’d not been pleased that her niece had begged her grandfather to  be allowed to search for a husband, instead of accepting her aunt’s  arrangements. Sung Li might have the purest bloodline in the village, but she  had no wish to marry the letch. Yet, sadly, he had proved to be no worse than  most of the boys she had found, and better than some. Better the devil you  know.</p><p>
  If only he could have been...</p><p>
  A faint echo from the far end of the valley caught her  attention. A voice. After a week of solitude, someone else had entered the  valley.</p><p>
  Curious as to whom else would travel to such an  out-of-the-way training ground, and eager to escape her thoughts, she moved  towards the sound. Dancing from pole to pole, she crossed the small valley. As  she drew near, she heard a voice speaking a language that took her a few  minutes to place as Japanese. Despite her grandfather’s insistence that she  learn the languages of the countries around China, she’d never had much of a  gift for them. As she drew closer, she could finally make out what was being  said.</p><p>
  “And now we come to Legendary Training Ground of  Accursed Springs...”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The speaker was a chubby Chinese guide in the  standard-issue Communist uniform, leading two Japanese tourists, each wearing  gi.  She noted absently that like so many  people who had allowed their jobs to define them, his chi aura was a grey echo  of his physical self.  That was not the  case with the two who traveled with him, however.  </p><p>
  The taller of the two was rather heavyset, and was  wearing a bandanna over his bald head. Strings behind his ears held a pair of  round glasses in front of his eyes. His gi was rumpled and sweat stained, and  gave every indication of having been slept in frequently.  Similarly, the image in his aura showed a once  noble warrior wearing a suit of armor that was as soiled and stained as his  clothes. She shook her head sadly at the echoes of a fall from grace even as  she noted the small signs that marked him as an accomplished martial artist.  She had encountered many like him on her  travels, and they always made her depressed.   So many warriors’ spirits ground down by the oppression of a world that  no longer valued them. </p><p>
  The young man with him, though...</p><p>
  She stopped on top of a pole to study him more  closely. He moved casually, yet with that same assurance of a master martial  artist. But it was the image in his aura that captured her gaze.</p><p>
  He stood as a simple warrior, garbed in plain clothes  that were worn with use, surrounded by a blaze of untamed chi.  Through the haze of raw power, he shimmered,  seemingly flowing from fire to ice to smoke, but nonetheless projecting a sense  of solidity as strong as a mountain.  She’d  never seen anyone so… chaotic.</p><p>
  Intrigued, she watched as the pair dropped their packs  and jumped to the pole-tops as easily as she could. Over the protests of the  guide, they assumed stances on poles not far from where she stood, seemingly  oblivious to her presence, focused as they were on each other. She hopped a  pole closer as they challenged each other, then watched in approval as they met  in midair and traded a volley of kicks and punches.</p><p>
  She barely heard the guide warn, “Is very bad you fall  in spring!” as she hopped to yet another pole for a better vantage.</p><p>
  The older man went flying with a splash into the pool  at her feet as the young man landed on a nearby pole. He watched with her as  the water settled. Still seeming not to notice her, the young man called, “Hey  Pop! We done already?”</p><p>
  Distantly, she heard the guide moaning. “Oh no! You  fall in Spring of Drowned Panda! Tragic legend, very tragic!” The rest faded as  to her shock, a giant panda erupted from the pool straight at the young man.  Too stunned to move, she watched as it batted the young man right at her.  Instinctively she attempted to move aside, but stepping back, her foot found  only air.</p><p>
  The boy’s flailing foot caught her already off balance  as he flew by to land in a pool about fifteen feet away. She fell towards the  clear surface of a spring, her swords flying away from her hands as she vainly  tried to change her trajectory. Then she hit with a splash, and as the water  closed over her, she heard the guide lament, “You fall in Spring of Drowned  Young Girl!”</p><p>
  The water was far colder than she expected and deeper  than it had looked. She experienced a strange surge of dizziness that made her  lose her bearings for a second, and then her head broke the surface. As she  opened her eyes, she saw the panda run by, being chased by a buxom redheaded  girl, in turn being chased by the guide. She blinked in confusion. They had the  same auras as the older man and the boy, but strangely shifted to show the  altered forms. They disappeared into a swirl of fog, and as she turned to dive  after her swords, she heard a yell and another splash.</p><p>
  It took her nearly five minutes to find her swords  among the rocks at the pool’s bottom. As she came up for the final time, a low  growl from behind made her turn and freeze.</p><p>
  Two large feline eyes looked at her from over a pair  of canines a good nine inches long. She floated frozen for a few seconds until  she realized that the huge cat didn’t look hungry, but wet and disgusted. And  if anything, she would have sworn it was leering.</p><p>
  It looked her up and down, then shook its head and  turned to pad off with a sound suspiciously like a chuckle.</p><p>
  Stranger and stranger. She watched as the enormous  catlike creature disappeared into the fading morning mist before swimming to  the edge of the pool. She grimaced as she realized the knots securing the front  of her dress had come undone and, as she levered herself up onto a rock, she  pulled it closed...</p><p>
  ...Or tried to. It didn’t want to stretch enough to  cover her bosom. Her fingers found torn cloth where the knot-work had ripped  free. She looked down and froze as she caught sight of her hands.</p><p>
  Her nails had grown to nearly an inch and came to  razor sharp points, while her fingers looked to be slimmer. Then she noticed  her raven black hair was now sun gold. Momentary confusion gave way to the  sudden memory of the guide’s voice, “Now, whoever fall in pool take form of panda...”</p><p>
  In shock, she raised one of her swords and looked in  the long, narrow mirror. Her normally oval face was now more heart-shaped, and  her normally jade-green eyes were a luminous emerald, with a more pronounced  tilt. They dominated her face, and the slit pupils recalled the eyes of her  guardian deity. Ebon lashes swept out to frame those dragon eyes, and spun gold  upswept eyebrows gave that face a nearly unearthly exotic beauty that her  pointed, almost animalistic ears only accented. The pointed upper and lower  canines added to the wildness of her appearance. As she stood, she realized she  had gained nearly three quarters of a foot in height and had filled out  enormously. Her expanded bust had ripped the ties free on her dress, and the  skirt had ridden up several inches. Strangely, her shoes were only a little  tight.</p><p>
  Remembering the panda, she figured she was extremely  lucky; beyond the long fingernails and that exotic face, she was still human  looking. She had no idea what she had been cursed to become, but at least it  wasn’t completely an animal like the panda.   That was almost a disappointment though.   As a panda, she might have been able to escape her marriage to Li.</p><p>
  She took off the dress and wrung it out, then did the  same for her underwear; damp was better than soaked. She rigged a way to tie  the dress closed and redressed just as her ears caught the sounds of distant  combat from the cliffs above. She sprang towards a pole to investigate, and  narrowly missed falling into another pool as her altered size threw off her  reflexes. Opting for the safer course of running, she sprinted towards the  distant noise.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Several minutes later, she was on a ledge partway up  the cliff when she caught the sound of a lone hiker above her. The sounds of  the panda and the girl were fast approaching too, and as she was trying to find  a way up, the pair passed by and a large object came over the cliff towards  her.</p><p>
  She dived to the side as the shadowy form plummeted  past, realizing too late it was another poor victim of the duo, a  strong-looking boy with a huge pack. She winced as he landed in a pool below  her with a huge splash.</p><p>
  She hurried back down the path from the ledge, not  trusting her jumping ability. It took several minutes to get back down to the  edge of the pool, which unfortunately meant she was too late. By the time she  reached the pool, the panda had already snagged the small black piglet that had  crawled out of it, half drowned. He skipped away with the piglet as she drew up  to the edge of the spring. She snagged the unfortunate boy’s pack with one of  the ribbons on her swords and dragged the incredibly heavy thing out of the  pool. She left it at the water’s edge and snapped the ribbon dry as she  followed the panda’s trail.</p><p>
  She arrived at the guide’s hut just in time to see him  holding the piglet over a large cooking pot and called out to him, “Don’t cook  that pig!”</p><p>
  It was too late; even as the guide turned towards her,  his eyes widening, his hand had released the piglet and it was falling towards  the boiling water.  She dived to rescue  him from the scalding water, but as her hand and the piglet hit the hot water,  two things happened simultaneously: she lost her balance as she suddenly lost nine  inches of height and about thirty pounds; and a naked boy replaced the piglet.</p><p>
  She couldn’t stop herself as she crashed into him and  they both fell over the stove to the floor, followed by the pot of water. The  boy scrabbled wildly to avoid the water and gallantly tried to push her out of  the way as well, but his hand met the already ripped ties, and with a loud rip,  she and the dress parted ways.</p><p>
  She landed in a sprawl with a bruised rear, clad only  in her panties. The boy on the other side of the puddle of steaming water  looked at the shredded dress in his hand, then up at her bare breasts. A gout  of blood poured from his nose as his eyes rolled up into his head and he  fainted.</p><p>
  For a few seconds, there was only stunned silence,  then the guide spoke. “So sad. Now have no pig to cook nice for lunch.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>She fled the hut only long enough to retrieve a new  dress from her campsite, but found the pig boy had departed while she was gone.  The panda had obviously availed himself of the hot water as well, since the  older man had replaced him. She noted he gave her an appraising look before  bowing, like he was checking her for visible weapons.</p><p>
  “Hello, young lady. I am Genma Saotome of the Saotome school of Anything Goes martial arts, and-“ he  waved over at the table where a once again male teen sat eating ravenously from  a big bowl of noodles, “-this is my son...”</p><p>
  “Ranma,” he said around a mouthful of ramen.</p><p>
  She bowed and assayed her broken Japanese. “Song Zhu  Shu, Song school   of Sword Dance.” She  noted the nod from the boy as well as his appraising look. She glared up at the  father. “Zhu Shu upset with panda man. Knock in spring. Not look where throw  son. Careless!” She put real venom in her look, imitating the tone her aunt  used with her far too often.</p><p>
  “See, Pop! You’ve ruined more than just my life!”  Ranma chimed in.</p><p>
  “Um... er... well...” Genma grinned sheepishly. “I-I  don’t suppose a simple apology would be enough?” he asked hopefully. Zhu Shu  shook her head. Genma eyed his son with a rather mercenary gleam in his eye,  then asked, “Um... Do you think we could discuss this... er... privately?” His  eyes darted towards the door.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu noted his look suspiciously, but curiosity won  and she nodded, wanting to see what he planned.</p><p>
  She followed Genma outside to a stand of trees out of  earshot of the hut and asked him, “What you up to, panda man?”</p><p>
  “Well, as you can see, we are but poor wandering  martial artists, and I possess nothing with which to repay you for the  unfortunate accident you suffered, unless... May I ask you why you are in  Jusenkyo?”</p><p>
  “Why?”</p><p>
  “Perhaps, if I know the nature of your quest, I can  aid you in some manner to repay my debt.”</p><p>
  She knew he was stalling, but she answered anyway. “Zhu  Shu seek husband.”</p><p>
  Genma’s eyes lit up as he saw an apparent easy way  out. “Then nothing could be simpler. My son is nearly finished with his  training and must soon seek a wife, a martial artist of equal skill. You appear  to be such a godsend. I offer you Ranma’s hand in marriage.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked away, at the hut, conflicting desires  fighting in her thoughts. She didn’t trust Genma, and she didn’t know Ranma,  but she remembered the hidden depths in his aura, the indications there was far  more than showed on the surface.</p><p>
  Moreover, his curse was... intriguing. How would he  handle it? He seemed so arrogantly masculine at first glance, yet became such a  beautiful female.  </p><p>
  Honor and familial duty demanded she produce an heir,  whatever her desires. Ranma possibly offered a chance to satisfy both her own  wishes and those of her family… yet she could not commit to a marriage that  might not be suitable. Ranma could prove to be a worse letch than even Sung Li,  and she’d be in just as intolerable a situation. Nevertheless, there was a  chance...</p><p>
  A chance at possible happiness versus a return in  failure to accept a marriage she knew would be misery was no choice at all, yet  she could not commit herself with so little information.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu tells you what do. Panda man visits training  grounds, yes, no?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu travel with. See what kind of husband Ranma  make. If like, will betroth. If not...” In a lightning fast move, she pulled  her swords from behind her back and caught the surprised man against a tree,  her crossed blades just touching Genma’s adam’s apple. “Zhu Shu takes payment  out of panda man’s hide!!!” She grinned at Genma’s uneasy swallow.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu retrieved her small pack from her camp and  returned to the guide’s hut to find the Saotomes sparring again. She took a  moment to look over her potential husband, and contemplated what she was going  to do next.</p><p>
  While she was happy to have found a possible solution  to her quest, she was thoroughly annoyed at the loss of her best practice  dress. It had been the only one she’d had that could stand up to the  contortions of her daily exercises. The rest would survive a sparring session  well enough, but she was out of luck for practice. Early morning kata seemed  her only option considering the looks she had already gotten from the guide and  Genma during her brief toplessness.</p><p>
  She found a good spot to continue watching the pair as  she began to alter her remaining dresses to accommodate a sudden dousing. As  she sewed away the hour, she studied Ranma out of the corner of her eye,  observing his various moves and style. She was definitely intrigued, especially  following his dunking in the small stream near the hut. Ranma was at least a  martial artist of her caliber, or above, and seeing how quickly he adapted to  his altered size and balance was impressive. She had to admit Genma had trained  Ranma well, if oddly. His style was unorthodox, a blend of so many schools that  Zhu Shu could identify barely a dozen moves, and he shifted from one style to  another with unconscious ease. She had sparred with many masters of various  schools in the last year, yet she was unsure she could beat Ranma in a serious challenge;  his very unpredictability would give him an edge. She had at best a fifty-fifty  chance without calling on her clan’s secret techniques, and she wasn’t entirely  certain then.  Who knew what secret  techniques <em>he</em> might have in reserve?</p><p>
  And that wild mélange of schools could account for why  his chi was so changeable.  Every martial  school had it’s own chi techniques that would be taught as a student  progressed, but Ranma had been taught so many schools that she had no doubt  he’d only had a haphazard training in chi control.  Genma had concentrated almost solely on  physical skills.</p><p>
  She smiled as she applied the finishing touches on her  last dress and put it away, returning her gaze to the still ongoing brawl just  as Ranma landed in the pond next to the guide’s hut yet again. Now seemed as  good a time as any to begin feeling Ranma out.</p><p>
  The currently female boy emerged from the pool to find  Zhu Shu standing in front of him with wooden practice swords point downward in  her hands. He flung his long ponytail back over his shoulder. “Whadda you  want?” he grumped.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu be honored with Ranma spar?”</p><p>
  He gave her an appraising look and shrugged  halfheartedly. “Yeah, I guess so. Hey, Pop! I’m gonna spar with Zhu Shu for a  bit!”</p><p>
  The panda gave Zhu Shu long look, then grunted and  wandered back into the hut.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu stood by politely as Ranma stripped off his  shirt and wrung out the water, his rosy-pink nipples erect from the cold pond. “You’ve  been watching me. I saw you while Pops and I fought.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, a slight smile on her face, her cheeks  lightly tinged with rose.</p><p>
  “Studying my moves, right?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “Whatcha think?” He asked, cocking a hand on one hip  jauntily as he slung the shirt over his shoulder.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled, her cheeks growing ever so slightly  redder. “Ranma very good. Unpredictable. Against opponent who never fight  before, Ranma probably win quick.”</p><p>
  “You think you could beat me?” The challenge in the  redhead’s eyes was unmistakable.</p><p>
  The small Chinese girl shrugged.  “Zhu Shu see,” she said as she raised the  twin practice swords, the ribbons tied to their pommels starting to swirl  around her. “Zhu Shu face many in last year. No-one beat.”</p><p>
  “I ain’t just anyone,” Ranma grinned. “And I never  lose.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu tilted her head at the boy-turned-girl as she  gave him a look through half lowered lashes. “Zhu Shu see.” She gave Ranma a  warm smile.</p><p>
  Ranma put his shirt back on and assumed a stance. “Whenever  you’re ready.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>They sparred most of the afternoon, Ranma learning  quickly that Zhu Shu was too fast not to take seriously, even though she had  decided not to use any of her clan’s secret techniques. A few good, hard smacks  had gotten him over trying to hold back, without her having to resort to  anything beyond purely physical skills.</p><p>
  As it was, he’d managed to learn unarmed counters to  almost all of her sword techniques in a few hours. It was almost frightening  how quickly he picked up things her grandfather had spent years teaching  her.  But she’d also learned she’d been  right.  For all his physical skill, he  still lacked training in advanced chi techniques, though from the sheer levels  of barely-disciplined energy she could feel flowing through him, once he  learned them, likely no-one she had ever met would match him. He had even  started matching her un-chi-augmented speed, which no-one she had fought had  done, and he had almost succeeded in getting a blow past her ribbons towards  the end.</p><p>
  It had been a pleasure to actually find a sparring  partner that she didn’t have to hold back on, but who also wasn’t trying to  prove he was her better on general principle. He did have a huge ego, but once  he had established she could hold her own and wasn’t trying to show him up, he’d  relaxed and simply enjoyed their sparring. They’d stopped frequently to explain  to one another how this particular attack was done, or which counter would be  more effective against a particular move. By mid-afternoon, she’d started to  demonstrate for Ranma some of her more advanced moves, as he showed her various  attacks of the Saotome School.  </p><p>
  By dinner time, they had forged a strong respect for  their respective skills, and had begun feeling each other out as friends,  deciding they actually liked each other. He certainly showed that he liked her  cooking.</p><p>
  They talked while they ate, Ranma and his father  polishing off a meal large enough to feed a court outing, and afterwards Ranma  helped her with the dishes. Genma had spilled the dishwater on Ranma as they  were finishing, and Zhu Shu had made the panda clean up the mess, secretly enjoying  the grin on the redhead’s face. It made her feel good to know Ranma had  appreciated the support. All in all, she had to give Ranma credit for being one  of the nicest boys she’d ever known, though he was also one of the least  educated in the social graces.  She found  his utter lack of polish refreshing after the innumerable number of men she had  met in the last year whose civility and grace hid little more than animal lust  and utter distain for her as anything other than a potential bedmate. Ranma hadn’t  even complained too much when Zhu Shu had told him she’d already put away the  kettle and wasn’t going to pull it out again just to heat water. The redhead  had just looked at the panda and shrugged. The slight smile he gave Zhu Shu  just before the lights were doused let her know he thought it was poetic that  Genma would have to sleep in wet fur.</p><p>
  As she meditated before sleep, Zhu Shu thought back  over everything that had changed since that morning, reflecting that the gods  sometimes had a strange sense of humor. She just hoped that this time, they  weren’t pulling a joke at her expense...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Around midnight,  Zhu Shu woke to a scream. A quickly lit lantern revealed a horrified Ranma  standing in the middle of the hut staring at the trickle of blood running down  his legs. Zhu Shu shook her head, her heart going out to the newly female  Ranma. She’d been horrified her first time too, and almost as panicked.</p><p>
  The Panda grunted, holding up a sign that Zhu Shu  couldn’t read. She waved him away. “You go sleep. Zhu Shu deals with. You no  can help.”</p><p>
  “What’s wrong with me? Why am I bleeding?” a plaintive  wail came from the frightened redhead.</p><p>
  “Nothing wrong. Ranma be okay. Is female thing.”</p><p>
  Genma grunted, then went back to his mat. The Guide  turned beet red and dove for his bed as well.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu paid them no mind as she drew her small  brazier out and blew the coals back to life.</p><p>
  “How can I be ok?!! I’m bleeding to death!!!”</p><p>
  “Ranma be silly. Not bleed to death. Is only female  cycle. Happen every month.” Zhu Shu said matter-of-factly.</p><p>
  “Every MONTH!?!?” Ranma whimpered, his eyes huge.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Every month.”</p><p>
  “You mean I’m going to bleed like a stuck pig every  month?!!” He sounded on the verge of hysteria.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu set a kettle on the brazier and looked at  Ranma patronizingly. “Ranma be okay. Zhu Shu knows. Zhu Shu have cycle too.  Stop whining.”</p><p>
  Ranma recoiled, but anger replaced the panic in his  eyes. “I am not whining!” he whined.</p><p>
  “Are too. Cycle fact of life. Accept.”</p><p>
  “I’m a guy!! I don’t have to get used to it!!”</p><p>
  “Ranma is girl now. Must deal with fact of life.”</p><p>
  “Only until that water’s hot!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No. Water not for change.  Ranma stay girl until cycle done.”</p><p>
  “Like hell I will!!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu put her hands on her hips and glared at the  redhead. “Idiot. Many waterfalls near. Much rain. Many ponds. Ranma cannot stay  boy. Will change many times. Cycle be there each time. Blood on clothes unless  use pad. Will use many pad. Zhu Shu not has many. Cannot waste or Zhu Shu has  none for <em>her</em> cycle. Ranma stay  female. Get over cycle. Use fewer pad. Not waste!”</p><p>
  “But this is ridiculous! I’m bleeding everywhere, and  I’m cramping!!!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu rolled her eyes. “So? Zhu Shu does same every  month. Ranma not get sympathy. Stop whining.”</p><p>
  “I’m not whining! I’m in pain!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu folded her arms and nodded sagely. “Ah. Zhu  Shu understands. Zhu Shu stronger than Ranma. Zhu Shu not run from fact of  life. Ranma whine and give up.” She loaded as much sarcasm into her voice as  possible.</p><p>
  “I’ve never given up on anything in my life!” Ranma  hissed.</p><p>
  “Ranma give up now.”</p><p>
  “Like hell! If you can stand this, I can!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow archly. “Ranma think can  match Zhu Shu?”</p><p>
  “Damn right!!!”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu see,” she said as she poured warm water on  the towels she had brought out. “For now, we clean Ranma and brew tea for  cramps.” At the startled look from Ranma, she laughed. “Zhu Shu <em>deal</em> with fact of life, not mean she <em>like</em> cramp.”</p><p>
  Ranma couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The next morning, Zhu Shu rose before the others and  took out her bathing supplies. Through half closed eyes, Ranma watched as she  looked over her dresses and sighed before grabbing one and heading out the  door. After she had left, Ranma opened his eyes fully and sighed as well.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu made him feel so strange. The Chinese girl was  an absolute enigma. She was demure, but at the same time possessed an aura of  complete confidence. She’d cleaned the hut and cooked dinner last night with  competent ease, radiating an aura of contentment and tranquility, but when she’d  made his dad clean up the mess he’d made after dinner, she’d displayed a mettle  that had commanded his father’s swift obedience.</p><p>
  Then there was their sparring match. Zhu Shu had  treated him as neither a competitor nor an incompetent, like his dad did. She  had simply shown him that she respected his style and considered it a match to  her own. She was totally dependant on her weapon forms, which he viewed as her  biggest weakness, but in her specialization, he had been hard pressed to match  her. He had enjoyed the challenge, since it had forced him to push his  endurance for moving at speed, and he found he had enjoyed the way Zhu Shu  treated him. She hadn’t tried to belittle him, or correct him, or treated him  like a fool; she’d simply accepted Ranma as he was. Like Ukyo always had.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu had nothing else in common with Ukyo, the boy  Ranma had been friends with when he was six, but she treated him like Ukyo had.  Like... a friend. Zhu Shu hadn’t put on any airs; she’d just been herself and  let Ranma be himself...</p><p>
  Or herself, as the case may be at the moment.</p><p>
  He sighed as he sat up, mild twinges from his stomach  and the heavy odor of blood reminding him of why he was still a girl. He was  embarrassed about last night. He’d been convinced at first that he had irreparably  damaged himself experimenting, but Zhu Shu had been the calm rock in the storm  he had needed.</p><p>
  And he had yelled at her.</p><p>
  Another sigh escaped his lips. He really owed Zhu Shu  an apology.</p><p>
  He stood to follow the Chinese girl and slipped out of  the hut noiselessly. He followed the path around the hut to the small pool with  the waterfall, then stopped to stare at the vision in the mists before him...</p><p>
  Zhu Shu was standing on one foot on a rock beside the  pond and Ranma drank in the sight of her. Zhu Shu extended one leg and Ranma’s  eyes followed the long graceful arc of her calf up to her thigh and from there  to the joint of her legs, then up the soft flatness of her stomach. From the  swell of her full breasts to the arch of her supporting foot, she was all smooth  curves and shapely muscle. Her smooth, pale skin and utter lack of body hair  gave her the appearance of a finely carved Greek statue, brought to life by  some whimsical god. Ranma had never seen anyone so exquisitely and completely  feminine.</p><p>
  He watched as Zhu Shu completed her warm up stretches,  then reached behind her back to draw forth her swords. Ranma’s eyes widened -  Zhu Shu was just as nude from the rear; he’d confirmed that just seconds ago -  then the question of where Zhu Shu had hidden the swords faded from his mind as  she flowed into her sword forms.</p><p>
  Ranma had speed. He had skill. And until now, he had  thought he had grace - but for all the styles he knew, he had to admit he could  not match Zhu Shu’s sheer elegance of motion. Almost, he could hear music as he  watched her dance through the forms of the Song school, and he could not find  any better term for how Zhu Shu moved. From the intricate weaving of the long  narrow ribbons spiraling around her, to the hypnotic patterns of her twirling  swords, Zhu Shu moved to a rhythm only she could hear, but which called to  something primal within him.</p><p>
  Strange emotions warred within him, causing unfamiliar  hormones to flow as his female body began to feel flushed with warmth and  unaccustomed pressures began to build. A small trickle of blood started to drip  unnoticed down his face from his nose as the sensations grew stronger. He felt  torn as the sight of Zhu Shu made him wish that he could study her, and learn  from her that same aura of desirability.</p><p>
  Ranma’s breath caught when he realized what he’d just  thought. Wanting to be desirable?!! What kind of thing was that to be thinking?  Everyone would laugh at him, and his father would hold him up to ridicule in  shame of a son who had such thoughts! He had to get rid of this curse! He had  to find a way to be a male full-time again before this female body drove him  mad!!!</p><p>
  Zhu Shu apparently knew he was there, though. Ranma  watched as Zhu Shu put away her swords with a flourish, then turned to look at  him standing there limply like a fool. But the sparkles in her eyes made Ranma  realize she wasn’t angry or embarrassed.</p><p>
  “Ah. Ranma. Come join Zhu Shu in bath. Zhu Shu smell  blood from here. Come! You wash her back, she wash yours,” she said with a  laugh.</p><p>
  Ranma stood there in shock as Zhu Shu gracefully did a  back flip to dive with barely a splash into the pool. Then his jaw dropped  further as a pale blonde head broke the surface and green dragon eyes sought  his. “Come! Come! Zhu Shu cannot wash back by self!” the vision sang in a  musical voice that rang in his ears.</p><p>
  Ranma shook himself as he thought, <em>Ah, whathahell; we’re both girls anyway. It’s  not as if the water will reveal my real body. What’s the big deal? She doesn’t  have anything as a girl that I don’t have, right?</em> Justifications firmly in  place, he nodded to himself. Slowly, he approached the pool with its wet dream.  His Dad had told him Zhu Shu had been cursed, but...</p><p>
  “I had no idea you’d look like <em>that </em>in your cursed form,” he finished aloud.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “No big deal. Annoying. Zhu Shu has  enough men try use her already. Only make worse.”</p><p>
  “Use you?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave Ranma a long look as the redhead slipped  off his loose top and shorts before gingerly removing the panties Zhu Shu given  him. Ranma was relieved to see only a little fresh blood. As he slipped into  the water, Zhu Shu finally answered.</p><p>
  “Ranma will find pretty is not always good. Many men  find Zhu Shu pretty. Want to posses her. Think in love only because she pretty.  Try to make Zhu Shu into pet. Now she is more pretty. Make problem worse. Ranma  girl now; will find out.”</p><p>
  Ranma blushed. “Umm...”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a sidelong glance. “Zhu Shu not worry  about Ranma. Is friend. Zhu Shu safe as she want be, yes, no?” She smiled  warmly, showing too-long canines.</p><p>
  Ranma blushed harder. “I-I wanted to apologize for  yelling at you last night...”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu laughed. “No worry. First day hormone very  bad.” She held out a washcloth and a bar of soap. “Now, is Ranma ready for  female lesson?”</p><p>
  “Lesson?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded emphatically. “Lesson. Ranma have  female body now. Have much to learn about. Must take care of.”</p><p>
  Ranma stared at her. “How can you be so calm and  matter-of-fact about this?” He shook his head. “I mean, this must be the worst  thing to ever happen to either of us, and you just shrug it off.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu no can change curse. Ranma no can change  curse. Could be worse,” the dragon girl said philosophically.</p><p>
  “How? I’m a boy who turns into a girl! How could it be  worse?!!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged as she began soaping up her arms. “Easy.  Could be pig.”</p><p>
  Ranma started to say something, then stopped. He shook  his head and laughed. “You’re right. It could be worse. Very well, Zhu-sensei.  Teach me.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>An hour later, after Zhu Shu had finished her lesson,  Ranma realized there was a lot about females he had been ignorant of.  Zhu Shu had taught him everything from the  need for proper hygiene to prevent numerous feminine illnesses to the meaning  of the cycle he was currently suffering from, and even taught him how to braid  his ponytail into a proper queue. He was glad Zhu Shu had been willing to teach  him, and that she had been so patient, and hadn’t laughed, or made him feel  dumb. She’d been completely straightforward and honest with all her answers.  Ranma had blushed till his ears burned asking some of his questions, but Zhu  Shu had never betrayed a trace of embarrassment, nor had she balked answering  any of them.</p><p>
  She’d been such a good teacher that it wasn’t until  Ranma was watching her dry off that he’d realized that he had not even thought  of Zhu Shu as sexy the entire lesson. It surprised him; he had just seen Zhu  Shu in more intimate detail than most husbands saw their wives, and it hadn’t  even occurred to him how weird it all was.</p><p>
  He’d just spent an hour naked with a stunningly beautiful  girl and had just accepted it as natural! He had to get out of this female body  before it drove him crazy!</p><p>
  He looked over to where the Chinese girl was now  leisurely combing out her waist length hair, unconcernedly wrapped in only a  towel, and swallowed hard. He dressed hurriedly and went around to the front of  the hut just as Genma was coming out.</p><p>
  “Ah! There you are, Boy. Prepare yourself! I won’t go  easy on you just because you’re a girl!!!”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Normally, it took two days to travel to the Amazon  village, but the Saotomes sparred so much and meandered so much that the  journey looked like it would take closer to a week. Zhu Shu really didn’t mind,  as it was giving her the opportunity to spend time with Ranma and get to know  him better.</p><p>
  It had been three days since they had left the Guide’s  hut, and Ranma’s period had been blessedly brief. He had stopped bleeding on  the second day, and the poor boy had been overjoyed to return to being male.</p><p>
  At least until the brief shower near morning.</p><p>
  Ranma had gone out looking for breakfast as Zhu Shu  was doing her forms, and while he had returned male, he hadn’t said much about  where he’d found hot water. Genma hadn’t even bothered to ask, just started in  with “training” as they traveled, but Ranma had been giving Zhu Shu furtive  glances since then.</p><p>
  It was dinner time before they really had a chance to  talk. Ranma casually volunteered to help Zhu Shu clean the dishes at the small  stream a little ways from their camp. Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow, but nodded  when Genma just grunted as he lay down to sleep.</p><p>
  At the edge of the stream, Ranma looked over at the  forms of the two men by the fire to make sure they weren’t close enough to hear  before sighing in relief.</p><p>
  “What Ranma want?” Zhu Shu asked. “Been looking Zhu Shu  all day.”</p><p>
  Ranma sat down on a log. “Do you know anything about  Chinese magic?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu perched beside him. “Zhu Shu know herbs. Some  magical. Zhu Shu not know much. Zhu Shu not wizard.” She gave him a raised  eyebrow. “Ranma need spell?”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed. “Maybe. I don’t know. I was hungry this  morning and found an inn. The innkeeper was making porridge, and it smelled so  good...”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “What Ranma do?”</p><p>
  “I was hungry!” He said defensively. “I didn’t know it  was some screwy spell!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded sagely. “Ranma want know if can undo.”</p><p>
  Ranma grinned ruefully. “Yeah, I mean, you’re Chinese  and all.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu rubbed her temples. “Zhu Shu train be servant,  not Court Wizard. What spell?”</p><p>
  Ranma undid his ponytail for a few seconds, and in the  time it took for him to retie it, it had grown six inches. “It’s a hair spell,  and the only way to stop my hair from growing until it’s all gone is if I keep  it tied with a Dragon’s Hair.” He held up a long strand of thick hair. “Do you  think you can fix it?” He asked hopefully.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu took the strand and looked at it dubiously,  then at the desperate hope in Ranma’s eyes. “Zhu Shu not know. Not know the  ingredients of spell.”</p><p>
  Ranma handed her a piece of parchment. She looked the  ancient slip of paper over and sighed. “Zhu Shu try. Not make promise.” </p><p>
  The scroll was very old Han, the ideograms hard to  read due to subtle differences that time had wrought, but she nodded  finally.  “Ah.  Is also recipe for reversal of spell.  Zhu Shu should have ingredients.  Will follow and hope.”</p><p>
  She took out her small brazier and blew the coals to  life, setting a small kettle on it to warm. Then she pulled out her herb kit as  she re-scanned the parchment carefully. Ranma watched her as her hands rifled  through the kit and pulled out various items to toss into the kettle.</p><p>
  “Don’t you need to look for which herbs you’re  grabbing?” He queried.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No. Aunt made sure Zhu Shu  can do blindfolded.”</p><p>
  “Why’d she make you train so hard? I, mean, it’s not  like martial arts or anything.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a long look before sighing and  shaking her head. “Martial arts not all, Ranma. Good servant have many skills.  Zhu Shu must be as good servant as warrior.”</p><p>
  “Why though? I mean, even I know the Communists wiped  out the old Chinese imperial government. There’s no Emperor for you to serve.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu snorted. “Communists only wipe out pretenders.  Zhu Shu family serve real Emperor. Wait for return many centuries. Makes no  difference. Duty is to serve.”</p><p>
  “That’s silly, though. I can understand keeping up the  family school, but why all the other stuff? From some of what you’ve told me,  your aunt was a harder taskmaster than your granddad, and she didn’t even want  you to learn fighting.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded as she finished chopping herbs and  dumped them into the kettle. “Aunt is very traditional. Females learn home  arts, males fight. Had Zhu Shu had a brother, he would be warrior.”</p><p>
  “Oh. Man, that could have been some sparring match,  then.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a raised eyebrow. “What mean? Zhu Shu  not challenge?”</p><p>
  “Nah, you’re a challenge, but, no offense, you’re a  girl. Guys are just better at martial arts.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave him an impenetrable gaze for several long  seconds, then looked down at the kettle. “Ah. Zhu Shu sees.”</p><p>
  Ranma missed the faint disappointment in her voice as  Zhu Shu finished with the small kettle. “Is that it?” he asked.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked down at the pot. “Not know. Scroll hard  to read.  If Zhu Shu do right, maybe fix  Dragon Hair spell.” She looked back up.   “But still need final ingredient.”</p><p>
  Ranma held up a small piece of thick hair.  “I got one long hair I cut into four  pieces.  I hope one of them is enough.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged.   “Scroll call for only piece.  Not  say how big.”  She took the hair and  dropped it into the kettle, provoking a flare of fire as the piece dissolved  into the herbal mix and the concoction glowed momentarily green.</p><p>
  “It supposed to do that?” Ranma asked.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged.   “Zhu Shu not wizard.  She not know.”</p><p>
  Ranma looked down at the mix. “I have to drink this?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Dragon Hair in porridge. Cure is  same.”</p><p>
  Ranma lifted the pot and gulped the potion down. He  wiped his lips. “Hey, that was pretty good! How long does it take to work?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu reached up and tugged the hair holding his  pony tail loose. “Not know. Will see.”</p><p>
  Ranma held his breath.</p><p>
  His hair hung quietly, showing no inclination to grow.</p><p>
  “Yes!” he exclaimed softly as he jumped up. “I’m  cured!”</p><p>
  He didn’t see the branch he stepped on that tipped up  and dumped him in the stream. He stood spluttering in the cold water. “Damn it!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu handed him the hair. “Zhu Shu sorry,” she said  apologetically. “Seem only fix part of spell.”</p><p>
  Ranma looked down to see a long mass of red hair,  growing longer by the second. He quickly wrapped his hair into a ponytail and  tied it off. “It’s not supposed to grow when I’m a girl!”</p><p>
  They looked at each other. “Reversal,” they said  simultaneously.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave Ranma a downcast look. “Zhu Shu is sorry.”</p><p>
  Ranma trudged out of the stream dragging the sodden  mass of his soaked hair. “It’s not your fault, Zhu Shu. I asked you to try.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu tilted her head. “Maybe less likely to lose  hair as girl type Ranma. Still, Zhu Shu wish able to help.”</p><p>
  Ranma smiled at her. “Hey, you tried. That’s what  friends do.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. Yes, that was what <em>friends </em>do.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu looked at the wall of weapons that surrounded  her, remembering Ranma’s words from that night as she sighed mentally. She  should have known, should have paid better attention to the pair when they had  arrived at the Amazon village. She knew about the Amazons, but when she heard  the guide telling the pair about them, she had thought it would be okay. She  had wanted to see the tournament better, thinking the purple-haired warrior was  overmatched by the huge woman she was facing, and had gotten caught in the  crowd, unable to reach Ranma before he made his horrendous challenge. She  should have known she had to watch the pair.</p><p>
  Her mistake.</p><p>
  Green fire rippled down her blades and a faint green  aura flared as she turned to survey the hard faces that had surrounded her  following Ranma and Genma’s hurried departure.  She didn’t believe her clan’s secret  techniques would do more than slow the Amazons down, but, so far, they hadn’t  attacked...</p><p>
  A disturbance in the crowd attracted her eye and she  watched nervously as the ripple moved towards her. The crowd parted, and a  small, wizened figure balancing on a pole hopped into the ring, followed by the  dark purple-haired Champion that Ranma had just bested, her own bright purple  battle aura flaring in response to Zhu Shu’s. Zhu Shu gulped and quickly  grounded the points of her swords as she  allowed her chi to drain back into her body.</p><p>
  “Most Revered Elder, I am at your mercy. I ask  forgiveness for any offense I have given,” she said.</p><p>
  The crone nodded approvingly. “<em>You</em> have manners at least.” Her gaze rested for a moment on the  faint dragons etched on Zhu Shu’s swords, and her eyes widened slightly. “You  are Clan Dragon,” she stated half-questioningly.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.</p><p>
  “Tell me, Child of the Dragon, why do you travel with  such ill-mannered fools?” the elder asked more gently. A murmur of surprise ran  through the crowd at the elder’s change of tone.</p><p>
  “I am on a husband quest, Revered Elder. I wished to  see if Ranma Saotome would prove to be a worthy mate.”</p><p>
  The elder raised an eyebrow, “The girl who defeated  Shan Pu? Do you seek a husband or a sister-wife? Explain yourself, Child.”</p><p>
  Before Zhu Shu could answer, or query what a  sister-wife was, she was interrupted. “I would think the answer obvious,  Loremaster. The child smells of Jusenkyo.” another voice said behind her. She  turned her head slightly, but could see only another staff from her current  position.</p><p>
  “There is no need for forgiveness, Child of the  Dragon.” the second voice ordered, “You have not offended us. Stand proud as  the warrior you are. We will not harm you.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu rose and turned to face another elder who, if  anything, looked even older than the Loremaster.</p><p>
  “I am Ke Lun, Warleader of the Amazons, Child of the  Dragon. Shan Pu is my great-granddaughter.” She glanced over at the  purple-haired Champion and motioned with her hand. The Amazon’s battle aura  blinked out as she stepped meekly behind her elder. The white haired elder  addressed Zhu Shu again. “This Ranma Saotome, he is a Jusenkyo-cursed male?”  she asked sharply.</p><p>
  “He is, Honored Warleader.”</p><p>
  The elder looked her up and down appraisingly. “Have  you a claim on him, Child of the Dragon?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu bowed slightly. “I am his friend, Honored  Warleader.”</p><p>
  “Friend? What kind of friend abandons his companion to  face possible vengeance for actions he has done?” The elder asked, eyebrow  raised. “For all they knew, you too could have received a Kiss.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Ranma is new to friendship, and his  father controls him too often. Ranma Saotome has much in him of honor, yet it  is often overshadowed by his father’s questionable actions. Genma sought to  betroth Ranma to me secretly to repay his debt to me for causing my curse. I  arranged instead to travel with them to observe Ranma’s worth as a husband.”</p><p>
  “Seek you his hand?” The elder asked intently.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu thought about it for a long moment. Ranma  possessed so many of the qualities she wanted, but it had become obvious that  he lacked the one most desired aspect she had hoped for. Their talk that night by  the stream had made that painfully obvious. Without that, making him her  husband would be... too painful.</p><p>
  In the end, she sighed. “My quest has not yet been  fulfilled, Revered Warleader. I am Ranma’s friend. I claim no other ties. I am  aware of Amazon Law, and I seek no challenge for his hand. He is for Shan Pu to  take as husband. And yet...”</p><p>
  “Yes, Child?” Ke Lun asked gently.</p><p>
  “Ranma Saotome is not like other men. I do not believe  he can be tamed to be an Amazon male. To try and make him such may break him.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun gazed at her silently for a long moment, then  waved the ring of warriors away. She addressed Zhu Shu again. “It is said that  Children of the Dragon see much that others do not. Would you join us in my hut  for tea? I feel we have much to discuss before my great-granddaughter sets out  on her hunt...”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ke Lun interrogated Zhu Shu for hours, digging for  every scrap of information she had on Ranma. Shan Pu sat by, listening, at  first jealously, but soon realizing she had no cause. Before long, she was  laughing at Zhu Shu’s descriptions of Ranma reactions to being treated as just  another girl, and the stories of their travels together.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu found her heart going out to the cute Amazon  girl. For Shan Pu, the world was mostly black or white, with very few shades of  gray. She was a warrior, proud of her strength, and for her, losing to Ranma  had been a shame beyond bearing, redeemable only with Ranma’s death. Her Amazon  pride demanded she be the best, and for a non-Amazon woman to prove better was  an insult that could not be borne.</p><p>
  Yet once she had found out that Ranma had been male,  Shan Pu’s shattered world restored itself and her spirit had soared. Amazons  admired strength and skill above all, and for a male to possess enough of both  to defeat any Amazon on a purely physical level, let alone a Champion, made him  a more desirable mate than any amount of wealth or beauty. Even tired as she  was from having fought all of the other opponents, Shan Pu would have  overmatched most of the best martial artists Zhu Shu had fought over the last  year, but Ranma’s speed and power had been too much for the wearied Amazon.  Shan Pu hadn’t even had time to focus her chi. Ranma’s kick had swept her off  more than just the log.</p><p>
  It was obvious. Shan Pu was head-over-heels in love.  The small glances off into nothing whenever she mentioned his name, or the  little sighs of happiness when she thought about him, they all told Zhu Shu the  Amazon had fallen, and fallen hard.</p><p>
  It was even more obvious in her aura. The image Shan  Pu projected was a shy, blushing maiden wearing the armor of a warrior, yet  still radiating a sense of innocence. Zhu Shu was reminded of the looks Ying-Ying  had worn on so many occasions as they grew up, and it made her smile softly at  the memory. Hopefully, that innocence wouldn’t lead to Shan Pu’s downfall too.</p><p>
  Ke Lun wasn’t so simple though. She was far too old to  think in black and white, and she shielded her aura too well for Zhu Shu to see  anything. As she heard more of Zhu Shu’s story, her brow furrowed deeper in  thought.</p><p>
  Finally, she sent Shan Pu off to make dinner and  talked to Zhu Shu alone.</p><p>
  Ke Lun looked at Zhu Shu intently for a long moment,  then asked, “Tell me what you see, Child.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked into her teacup. “It will not be easy  for her, Revered Elder. Ranma has... much to learn. I fear he will break her  heart, and she will have no defense against it. As much as I see the warrior in  her, I see an innocent as well.” She sighed. “What I know of Amazons I know  from tales, yet it seems to me that much of that knowledge is true. As such, I  would say that Ranma shares a warrior’s heart, but his pride makes too many of  his choices. If Shan Pu tries to take him as an Amazon would, to conquer him,  she will only drive him away. His pride would not allow him to capitulate. He  has no knowledge of the Way of Hearts or the Arts of Desire, and he would see  such attempts as an effort to prove her superiority. His pride will never allow  for such submission, any more than hers likely would. I fear they will cause  each other much heartache before achieving a compromise.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “I fear I agree with you. It is the  Amazon way for the woman to rule. We find it produces a much more stable  society. However, I am aware that outlanders suffer from the annoying notion of  male superiority. We will just have to work around it. Ranma is a worthy  warrior in combat, but there is more to a warrior than skill at arms. He is at  least worth cultivating. I know that to be true, else you would not be his  friend. Would you see him happy?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.</p><p>
  “As I would see Shan Pu happy.” Ke Lun looked  thoughtful. “Happy or unhappy, he will be her husband; there is no choice in  Amazon law in this. Shan Pu must marry Ranma, but I fear they shall both  require much cultivation. She must learn not only how to love him, but how to  make him love her. That will not be easy.” Ke Lun looked at Zhu Shu in appeal. “Would  you aid me in achieving this end?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu stood and bowed deeply. “I am honored beyond  words at the request. I will, Revered elder.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun smiled. “Good.” She looked at Shan Pu in the  kitchen and sighed. “At least there is one area where I know they will  understand each other.”</p><p>
  “Honored Warleader?” Zhu Shu asked questioningly.</p><p>
  Ke Lun looked back at her. “You were cursed at  Jusenkyo, were you not?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.</p><p>
  “May I see your form? I have much to consider to  ensure you both are prepared for your journey. It would be helpful to know how  much I need to protect you against your curse.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “I have no major disadvantages,  Honored Warleader. If I may have some water?”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu. Bring water.” Ke Lun commanded. The violet  haired Amazon came in a moment later with a bucket. “Dinner is ready,  Great-grandmother.”</p><p>
  “Thank you.” Ke Lun handed the bucket to Zhu Shu, and  raised an eyebrow after she had changed. She seemed almost about to say  something in surprise, then shook her head and chuckled. “Forgive a foolish old  woman her worries, Child. You are correct. So long as you practice in your  cursed form as well, you should face no great disadvantage if you get wet in a  fight. Alas, Shan Pu is not quite so fortunate.”</p><p>
  A small pink and purple kitten jumped up in Zhu Shu’s  lap and purred. Zhu Shu looked over and saw Shan Pu’s clothes laying next to  the bucket. Then down at the kitten. It had Shan Pu’s aura, and winked at her.  Zhu Shu smiled back and began scratching her head as Ke Lun continued.</p><p>
  “While my great-granddaughter is our village champion,  she unfortunately ran afoul of the leader of some of our enemies when she was  thirteen. I had sent her out to gather herbs, and she was ambushed. She  accounted herself well, and with the aid of her cousin, sent them running, but  alas, as they fled, their last attack knocked them over a cliff above Jusenkyo.  He was wounded grievously while she became as  you see her now.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu growled for a second, then butted Zhu Shu’s  hand with her head in a demand for more scratching. Zhu Shu giggled.</p><p>
  Ke Lun shook her head. “And she’ll let you keep that  up all night. Shan Pu. Go change and serve dinner.”</p><p>
  The pink kitten bounced down and scurried off,  dragging her dress.</p><p>
  Ke Lun watched her go. “I suppose, if she had to be  wed to any outlander, I should thank my ancestors it’s to a cursed one, and a  warrior. With that as a base, maybe we can build a proper marriage.”</p><p>
  She turned back to Zhu Shu. “Having a friend who  understands will help as well. We are aware of Jusenkyo, Child, but we avoid  it. Shan Pu has no shame from the circumstances of her curse, but she still  bears the stigma of it. A childhood friend of hers left several months ago,  vowing he’d find her a cure. He’s a fool, but well-meaning. Having a strong  husband like Ranma will counteract the effects of her curse socially.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “I can understand that. Being the <em>female</em> heir to my Clan has led to my  share of strange looks.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow at her. “You are the last?”  She shook her head a second later. “No, of course you are, else you would not  carry the Dragon’s Fang and Talon.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, surprised Ke Lun knew of her sword’s  names. “I am. My father and mother perished when I was young. Only my aunt and  my grandfather remain.”</p><p>
  “And your aunt has no children?”</p><p>
  “She- she has proven barren and her husband died many  years ago.” Zhu Shu admitted.</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “I see. Your grandfather has trained  you well. How well, we shall see tomorrow.” She smiled as Shan Pu came out of  the kitchen with several bowls. “For now, we get to enjoy my  great-granddaughter’s cooking. And be sure to rest well tonight. You shall  leave after tomorrow’s practice...”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><em>THWACK</em>!!!!</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s bon buri intercepted the lightning-fast  thrust of the practice sword in Zhu Shu’s left hand as she just barely jumped  over the blade sweeping for her feet. She carried the motion into a full  somersault as Zhu Shu quickly turned the sweep into a cut through the bamboo  pole she’d been standing on. She landed on another behind the Mandarin girl,  but just as quickly abandoned it as Zhu Shu’s sword flickered through it as  well. Shan Pu launched her own attack in mid leap, the air pressure wave  shattering the bamboo pole a second after Zhu Shu blurred into motion straight  up. As Shan Pu landed, she had a sudden sense of danger, and barely raised her bon  buri in time to intercept the swords’ descent towards her head.</p><p>
  Green fire flickered along the blades as they sliced  through the shafts of her bon buri like they were air. Shan Pu turned her  crouch into a drop down the side of the pole, catching it just long enough to  halt her momentum and brace her feet for a leap past another pole.</p><p>
  The pole snapped off at its base as she snagged it in  passing, splinters trailing from the ragged end as she landed by a small  boulder. She took two steps and used the pole to vault upwards.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu met her in mid air, her blades blocking every  move of Shan Pu’s staff. Green fire twined around the sphere defined by Shan Pu’s  spinning weapon as she turned Zhu Shu’s ribbons aside, then with a violent  explosion of air pressure, they flew apart.</p><p>
  Shan Pu marveled again at Zhu Shu’s speed and skill as  she angled for a new perch. The Mandarin girl had been no challenge in unarmed  combat, but she was nigh unstoppable with her swords. Ke Lun had even allowed  her to use the Amazon’s secret techniques against the mysterious scion of Clan  Dragon, and she was still just holding her own. Zhu Shu’s style was so fast and  furious it was like fighting an octopus. She’d gone through eight bon buri in  the course of the sparring match, and still wasn’t sure Zhu Shu had been pushed  to her maximum speed yet. She focused as she descended and concentrated on  moving faster.</p><p>
  She used the springiness of a bamboo pole to absorb  her momentum and landed on a nearby rock, scanning for Zhu Shu. A flicker of  green from far overhead gave her a split second warning before a bolt of chi  shattered the rock under her feet. Shan Pu flipped in mid-air and began  grabbing the flying shards, launching them at Zhu Shu in a cloud.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s ribbons flashed around her in a globe and  pebbles flew in all directions. Her descent slowed until she almost seemed to  be floating as she dropped down lightly on a pole top in the middle of the  training ground. Shan Pu waited, catching her breath as Zhu Shu closed her  eyes. Warily, the Amazon prepared to defend.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu inhaled a long breath, then with a shouted, “Revealing  the Mind’s Eye!” She jumped simultaneously in two directions.</p><p>
  Shan Pu did a double take at the twin Zhu Shu’s,  trying to figure out which one was real, but neither sight nor sound gave an  immediate cue. Zhu Shu was too skilled to make any noise when landing. Shan Pu  looked over to where her Great-grandmother watched. How could the Mandarin girl  know the Amazon technique of “Splitting Cat’s Hair”?</p><p>
  No matter, the figure on the pole to the right was too  still. A light breeze rippled the skirt of the real Zhu Shu’s dress. Shan Pu  feinted towards the fake, then launched herself at the real one.</p><p>
  To her horror, at the last second, the illusion faded  away, pole, ground, and Zhu Shu vanishing to reveal the...</p><p>
  Shan Pu rolled through the pile of practice weapons at  the edge of the practice grounds with a clatter, rolling to her feet as Ke Lun  called a halt. She released her chi, the world resuming its normal flow as she  walked forward to meet Zhu Shu at the center of the Amazons’ training ground.  Ke Lun hopped over on her stick.</p><p>
  “Very good. I would say you should balance each other  out nicely.” Ke Lun said approvingly. “I have your supplies packed, and you may  leave on your quest immediately.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded as she turned to the shorter girl. “I  haven’t had that good a match in months. I almost wish you had been in the  tournament.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Almost?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s smile widened. “Almost. You might have won,  and then you’d be marrying Ranma.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s smile seemed to sadden slightly. “No,” she  said simply.</p><p>
  Shan Pu cocked her head. “Why not? I can see you like  him.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Ranma is for you. He is my  friend, nothing more.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu gave her a sidelong look. “You could marry him  with me. I would be honored to have you as a sister-wife.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu raised her eyebrow. “Sister-wife? I heard the  Loremaster ask me about that, but I dared not question what she meant.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun interjected. “Amazon law allows more that one  warrior to share a husband as sister-wives, Child of the Dragon. We have always  out-numbered our men, so long ago, we made... accommodations.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded happily. “And then you could have Ranma  too!”</p><p>
  For a long moment, Zhu Shu considered, and looked  almost as if she was on the verge of accepting, then a shadow crossed behind  her eyes, and she turned away. “I am honored by the offer, Shan Pu, but I  cannot accept as yet. I have not fulfilled my quest to aid you in finding him.  I can make no decision till then.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s eyes narrowed for a second as she thought.  Then she brightened again. “Then, if you will not be my sister-wife, will you  be my blood-sister? I owe you so much for enabling me to redeem my honor, Zhu  Shu. Please let me do something to thank you.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s emerald green eyes met hers. “I have never  had a sister, Shan Pu. I hope I will prove worthy of the honor.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu hugged her and whirled her around. “Wonderful!  There is nothing two sisters together cannot do!”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded. She smiled approvingly at Shan Pu as  she turned to the Mandarin girl. “Our ceremony is simple, but binding. If you  do not truly wish this, it may be refused without shame.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled shyly. “No, Honored Warleader. I will  accept Shan Pu as my blood-sister,” she replied formally.</p><p>
  “As I accept Zhu Shu as mine.” Shan Pu added.</p><p>
  “Then hold forth your weapon hand.” Ke Lun intoned as  she pulled a long throwing dart from her sleeve. The two girls held forth their  right hands, palm up. Ke Lun raised an eyebrow at the faint scar in the palm of  Zhu Shu’s hand, but said nothing as she used the razor sharp tip of the dart to  slice a small cut into each girl’s hand. “By blood you are joined, by blood you  are bound, two families joined as one, true sisters now are found.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu and Zhu Shu joined hands, a flash of green chi  swirling around purple as the link was forged. As they removed their hands,  only small scars remained where the cuts had been.</p><p>
  “Sisters, in so much more than blood,” Shan Pu said  with a happy smile.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Yes.” A fondly distant look came to  her eyes, as if she was recalling some memory. Shan Pu was too excited to  notice, but Ke Lun catalogued it, deciding she would not pry. </p><p>
  Yet.</p><p>
  “Now, let’s go find my husband,” Shan Pu said as she  picked up her pack. “If we hurry, we should catch up to him by nightfall.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s raised eyebrow let Ke Lun know she thought  Shan Pu was being <em>far </em>too optimistic.  She chuckled as she handed Zhu Shu a pack. “Here you are, great-granddaughter.  Some dresses for your travels. I noticed yours were a trifle worn.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, then smiled as she took the present. “I  am honored, Revered Warleader.”</p><p>
  “No. Great-grandmother.” Ke Lun corrected.</p><p>
  The smile on Zhu Shu’s face was enough repayment.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ke Lun stood and watched as the questing girls  vanished into the trees on the Saotome’s trail before turning and going back to  the elders’ hall.</p><p>
  “They are off?” The Loremaster asked as she entered.</p><p>
  “Yes,” Ke Lun answered. “Though from the speed with  which her fiancé ran away yesterday, it may be some time before she catches  him. Still, Shan Pu is our finest young warrior. She will succeed.”</p><p>
  “And what of the Child of the Dragon?”</p><p>
  “She is wise in many ways, but still a child. I’m  hoping her friendship with Shan Pu will temper my great-granddaughter’s  impetuousness.” She sat down. “Primarily, I am relieved to have found that Clan  Dragon yet survives.”</p><p>
  “Are you sure she is truly a Dragon?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “She bears the swords, and the mark of  her blood link to them in her palms. Only the true Heir would be so bonded.”</p><p>
  “She may have found them. It has been three hundred  years since we last heard of the Clan. There has been no sign of them since we  avenged them against the Musk. Perhaps the swords themselves created the bond.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun shook her head, old memories playing behind her  eyes. “No. She is the Heir. Of that, I have no doubt. A scavenger could never  have mastered the Song   School. And she is a  master. With the Talon and the Fang in hand, I am not confident that Shampoo  could truly best her.”</p><p>
  “High praise indeed, Ke Lun, that you would rate her so  well against your own progeny. Strange, then, that she seems so...  unprepossessing.”</p><p>
  “Yes. I will go to her home village and talk to her  grandfather. There are many questions that need answers. For now, she is safest  with her blood sister.”</p><p>
  Murmurs of surprise ran through the assembled elders  before the Loremaster waved them to silence.</p><p>
  “It seems you have decided what you believe already.  Very well, Ke Lun. We will leave this in your hands. Perhaps Fate has given us  a second chance to fulfill our oaths.” The Loremaster looked around at the nods  from the other elders. “It will be interesting to see how things develop.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “Indeed...”
