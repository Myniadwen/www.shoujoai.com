Clouds were torn in two, and a great gale shook the sky. Birds scattered 
and two planes were shaken as a mighty blur passed them in their domain. 
Pedestrian&#39;s pointed at the peculiar blur left in the sky, but none knew 
the answer to it; none but me that is. No one can catch me.

Three days have passed since the High Seraph&#39;s visit, and as he 
proclaimed my ban has been lifted. Since my powers came back roughly 
five hours ago, I haven&#39;t been able to stop flying. To feel the wind 
against my face and the world trail beneath me, there&#39;s nothing I love 
to do more. Once I felt the power return to my body I jumped to the sky 
straightaway; too happy to even say goodbye to everyone. Of course, I 
understand I shouldn&#39;t be flying at such high speeds on earth but this 
was a time for celebration. Rules can be broken, especially when the 
High Seraph might be your father in law someday, heh heh. Hmm it seems 
I&#39;ve adopted some of Peorth&#39;s evil ways...oh well.

Gathering more and more speed, I flew faster and faster. I could fly 
around the world in eight seconds now, nowhere near my best time of 1.23 
seconds, but it was still amazing to fly at such a high speed. I flew so 
fast the air current froze behind me and caused several clouds to freeze 
as well; when they melt it&#39;ll be a snowy day for the lucky country 
beneath. Ah, it feels good to be back.

Finally deciding that I should call it in a day, I started my leisurely 
fly back home. I started to wonder if the others even knew where I was 
and what Belldandy was making for dinner; flying uses up more energy 
than what it seems especially at such high speeds.

As I flew I noticed in the distanced two weak impulses of energy; too 
strong to be humans in a plane and too weak to be a god or demon. 
Slowing down I approached the impulses and realised them to be trainee 
gods under the Earth maintenance department. They were arguing intensely 
but stopped immediately when I flew in front of them. I usually don&#39;t 
interfere in their training but I&#39;m in a good mood and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll 
appreciate the help.

&quot;Lind-Sensei!&quot; exclaimed the trainee god. They both saluted and stood 
upright.

&quot;Where is your sempai? Or leader? Are they not meant to be escorting 
you?&quot; Just because I felt like helping them out doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t 
show my authority as a sensei; if I didn&#39;t Senya would yell at me until 
the demons take over heaven.

&quot;Well um...She&#39;s not your usual leader&quot; he responded

&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s um special&quot; the girl exclaimed. I raised an eyebrow at 
them.

&quot;Special?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you see she can&#39;t really fly yet, so she can&#39;t inspect this 
dimensional rip with us.&quot;

&quot;She can&#39;t fly!&quot; What sort of god is promoted to leader that can&#39;t even 
fly yet? Ridiculous. &quot;What&#39;s her name?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a norn. A second class goddess, limited category, in the 
Operations department&quot; he said. A Norn? There&#39;s only a few of them in 
the operations department. It can&#39;t be...&quot;I remember now! Her name is 
Skuld!&quot; I sighed; I could feel the headache starting in the back of head 
and it was slowly creeping to the rest of my brain.

&quot;I&#39;m not your leader in this operation but I have a solution. Wait here, 
I&#39;ll be back shortly&quot; I exclaimed and they nodded eagerly. I closed my 
eyes and focused of Skuld&#39;s energy pattern. When I located her, I 
instantly teleported there. She was out in the park sitting on a bench 
tinkering with a laptop. There were a few children around but they 
didn&#39;t pay attention to me. I simply walked to her and before she could 
even say hi I picked her up and teleported to where the students were.

Suffice to say, everyone was a little surprised when I returned holding 
Skuld out to them like I would a toddler.

&quot;AHHHHHHH!!!!! Lind you BAKA!!!!!!&quot; she yelled, thrashing about. You 
can&#39;t really blame her for yelling really. I was holding her loosely, 
she can&#39;t fly, and we&#39;re extremely high in the sky; I would be scared 
too if I was in her position.

&quot;Skuld, do you know who these two are?&quot; I asked. She stopped thrashing 
about realising I wouldn&#39;t drop her and stared at them.

&quot;.........OH!!!!! Seiji and Kano right?&quot; she exclaimed cheerfully. They 
nodded with dumbfounded expressions on their faces.

&quot;Do you know that you&#39;re meant to be teaching them about dimensional 
rips right now?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I can&#39;t fly so I told them to sort it out themselves! It&#39;s 
such a simple thing. How can anyone not understand dimensional rips?&quot;

It took a while but I managed to drill into Skuld&#39;s head that since she 
had her angel back certain responsibilities came with it. She did teach 
them about dimensional rips, and her explanation was rather good; I 
didn&#39;t expect it. The students flew off back to heaven and we returned 
home. My arms were too tired to carry her anymore so I made a platform 
for her to sit on that followed me as I flew.

&quot;This is so cool Lind!!!!!&quot; she yelled, swinging her legs off the edge 
and waving her arms around. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh, she wore her 
goggles and a pilot&#39;s hat, and it was adorable. I suppose she still is a 
child.

&quot;I&#39;m glad this experience has proven beneficial to you&quot; I called out.

&quot;Are you kidding me? Flying is so cool!!!!&quot;

&quot;You should be able to do it now that Noble scarlet is with you.&quot;

&quot;You would think that but no. Onee-San is to busy to teach me and Urd 
and Peorth would just laugh at me and torture me if I do it wrong....You 
can teach me Lind!&quot; We paused in the air. She looked at me with an 
adorable expression on her face and clasped her hands together begging 
me. &quot;Please Lind!!!! I&#39;ll never use your password to get into the system 
again!&quot;

&quot;You what?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never give your axe to banpei-kun again!&quot;

&quot;My axe!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never eat the last pot of ramen!!!&quot;

&quot;DEAL!...Ahem, I mean deal.&quot; Honestly, this girl knows what gets to me; 
at least now, I know where my axe has been disappearing off to all this 
time.

&quot;ARIGATO!!!! Lind you&#39;re the best!&quot; she screamed happily and started 
swinging her legs so wildly that she almost fell off the platform.

&quot;This shouldn&#39;t take too long. Jump off the platform.&quot; She face faulted.

&quot;WHAT!! I&#39;ll die!&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, I forgot about the incantation.&quot;

&quot;heh...silly you...baka&quot; she mumbled underneath her breath. I threw her 
my infamous death glare and she sat up straight and smiled guiltily at 
me.

I stretched my arm out to my side and used a small amount of wind and 
ice spirits to gather the clouds beneath Skuld and freeze. At least this 
way is she falls she lands on something.

&quot;Right. Flying is simple. Some people think it is natural for us 
goddesses to fly, however it&#39;s not true. That misconception comes from 
the fact that no one can see the flying incantation going on, since it&#39;s 
a non-verbal spell.&quot;

&quot;So you guys are actually saying a flying spell in your head all the 
time?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It requires so little energy to perform that you don&#39;t even 
realise your doing it. When you get more used to repeating the 
incantation you can fly faster.&quot;

&quot;Cool!!! What&#39;s the incantation then?&quot;

&quot;Go, go, lift off, go.&quot; Her mouth dropped open and she fell off the 
platform and landed on the clouds. Gathering herself from her fall she 
started up at me and yelled

&quot;ARE YOU SERIOUS!!&quot;

&quot;Yes, why would I lie?&quot;

&quot;But it sounds so stupid!!!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t complain to me, I didn&#39;t create the spell. Give it a go&quot; I 
exclaimed flying down to her level. Grumpily she crossed her arms and 
closed her eyes. &quot;Remember non-verbal spell, if you even mumble it, it 
won&#39;t work.&quot;

5 minutes passed but nothing happened. Impatient as ever she yelled and 
blamed me but I encouraged her to continue on. Even I started to get a 
bit bored when I noticed that a cloud was reacting to her. It spun 
around her and soon the rest of the clouds did as well. Then she started 
to float, higher and higher towards the sky until she was flying, 
genuinely flying.

&quot;Lind it&#39;s not working,&quot; she complained.

&quot;Open your eyes.&quot; She did and at first didn&#39;t realise what she was 
doing, but when realisation hit her she screamed excitedly yet again. 
Then she fell down quicker than I could blink and landed in front of me. 
Even though she was in pain she laughed giddily.

&quot;I did it!!! Did you see! I can fly!!!&quot; She leapt towards me in a great 
hug that tackled me to down onto the cloud. I returned the hug and 
patted her on the back.

It&#39;s odd I don&#39;t think I would have done so if I hadn&#39;t have met Peorth 
or this extended family of mine. I give thanks to them for changing me, 
I truly do. &quot;Come on Lind! Let&#39;s fly home.&quot; I felt that headache of mine 
creeping up on me again; I had better gather some more clouds.

Peorth

Hmph. Fly off without telling me eh? Fly off in a giant puff of smoke 
whilst I&#39;m trying to seduce you eh? Fly off whilst we&#39;re in a passionate 
embrace eh?! Well, someone is sleeping on the couch tonight! I slammed 
my cup of tea down onto the table, surprising Keiichi but Belldandy 
remained poised as ever. Urd who was lying in front of the TV watching 
her usual drama yelled out evilly

&quot;Sexual frustration isn&#39;t good for you!&quot; Keiichi and Belldandy both 
blushed furiously at the statement.

&quot;Oh yeah well you try having your lover just disappear in the midst 
of...&quot; I spat back but stopped when I realised Keiichi might pass out if 
I continued. Standing up abruptly, I exclaimed in my dignified manner, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to my room!&quot;

&quot;I hope it&#39;s not for &#39;that!&#39;&quot; yelled Urd then she burst out in a fit of 
giggles. Oh she was going to pay for that...I&#39;ll make sure of it.

Feeling in a western mood, I changed the d&eacute;cor of our room yesterday. 
Our room now looked exactly like mine in heaven. Red drapes, luxurious 
furniture and the all-important bed. I don&#39;t know how Japanese live with 
futon&#39;s all their lives.

I quickly threw myself onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling. I 
grabbed a pillow and covered my face with it, took a deep breath and 
shouted into it

&quot;LIND YOU BAKA!!!&quot; I took the pillow off my face; ah, I feel much better 
now.

Hmph. Cool and stoic my butt, Lind&#39;s really a bundle of a giant bundle 
of emotions and nerves, and she still has the romantic capacity of a 
teenager! Honestly how can she find flying more interesting than me?!

I digress though; I suppose regaining your powers after not having them 
for so long must feel, euphoric. It probably felt like the first time we 
gained our powers when we were still in our mother&#39;s womb. From the 
moment we are conceived, the first cell that creates &#39;you&#39; is blessed 
with power. We gods and goddesses can feel it; even to this day, we can 
remember the bliss of the power bestowed upon us. It matters not that we 
were not even born, or could not even talk or remember anything from the 
womb, all we know is that wondrous feeling of power and warmth creating 
us; Yggdrasil&#39;s blessing. My heart warms at the sheer memory of it.

My phone rang suddenly causing me to jump up in fright. It was the 
special goddess link phone that Skuld installed for me; it had a direct 
contact to heaven in case Admin needed contact with us for missions and 
what not. I reached over and answered it sitting up in bed.

&quot;Peorth speaking.&quot;

&quot;PEORTH-CHANNNN!!!!!&quot; screamed a high pitch voice which destroyed the 
right side of my hearing. Oh you&#39;ve got to be kidding me...

&quot;Mother! Don&#39;t scream like that!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll scream if I want to. After all, I haven&#39;t seen my Peorth-Chan in 
so long. Neh, put your darling on the phone I want to talk to her.&quot;

&quot;My darling?! Oh you mean Lind.&quot;

&quot;Of course I mean Lind, unless you have other darlings around?&quot; I could 
just imagine the smirk on her face.

&quot;Oh course I don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Let me talk to her then. Your father said she&#39;s absolutely adorable, 
but don&#39;t worry I did yell at him for using so much power against her in 
the trial. HA! Some High Seraph he is! The moment I start yelling at 
him, he begs for forgiveness and opts to do the washing up! HOHOHO if 
only the council knew the truth about whom really is the powerhouse in 
this family.&quot; My mother is scary when she&#39;s mad and I mean really scary. 
I mean she is the real creator of the whip punishment technique that I 
use for god&#39;s sake. I&#39;d be scared if I was father!

&quot;Yes, yes I know, father&#39;s really a coward when it comes to you. Anyway 
though Lind&#39;s not here right now. She&#39;s off flying somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Ohhhh&quot; she whined disappointedly &quot;I so wanted to talk to her.&quot;

&quot;You mean interrogate her. I&#39;m not letting you get anywhere near Lind 
without preparing her first&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Lind&#39;s not scared of little old me. I&#39;m harmless. Heh heh heh&quot;

&quot;I heard that!!! I&#39;m scared for Lind&#39;s well being here. I mean when 
Onee-san first brought back Shinji, you disguised yourself as me and 
tried to seduce him!&quot;

&quot;Oh you know I&#39;m harmless, besides I only do it with my children&#39;s best 
interests at heart.&quot;

&quot;Yes well, I&#39;ll bring Lind home sometime soon, so you can meet her 
then.&quot;

&quot;Oh there&#39;s no need for that.&quot; I swear I just heard an announcement in 
the background, and did I just hear someone say Goddess express train?

&quot;Why?&quot; I asked cautiously.

&quot;Why I&#39;m coming to visit you now. I&#39;m on the train, and should be on 
earth in about an hour. I&#39;m on this great tour package where it 
includes, lodging, food, shopping and that all-important destination 
stop on earth. Why I told your father to co...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!!!!!!&quot; I interjected. &quot;You can&#39;t come to earth!!!&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because!!! Lind just got pounded the other day by father. God knows 
what you&#39;re going to do!&quot;

&quot;Well you better get to her first then shouldn&#39;t you?&quot; Then she hung up. 
She hung up!!!!!

Oh crap...For once in my life I&#39;m actually terrified and frozen still. 
My mother is coming to earth to find Lind. I don&#39;t think Lind is ready 
to meet her. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m even ready to let them meet each other. 
God knows what she&#39;ll do to Lind! The woman has no boundaries!!! She 
plays with peoples minds and controls them according to her will.

I can see it now, she&#39;ll disguise herself as some voluptuous blond and 
try to seduce Lind!!! Then she&#39;ll put a spell, literally, on her and 
Lind will be her slave forever. NOOOOOOOOOOO!

No one except my sister&#39;s husband has managed to sway her advances!! She 
is an unstoppable menace that not even my father can stop. For all his 
power in the world, it is nothing compared to the terror my mother can 
inflict. I jumped from the bed and ran to the living room.

&quot;URD!!!&quot; She rolled over lazily to face me.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Mymothersaidshe&#39;scomingtoearth!!!&quot; Urd&#39;s face scrunched in confusion as 
she tried to decipher what I said, then she just turned blank, inflicted 
with the same terror that froze me earlier. Then realisation hit her

&quot;WHATTTTTT!!!!&quot;

&quot;I know!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t have her disguised as me again! Do you know how many stalkers I 
had after that?!&quot; Urd yelled.

&quot;Do you know how many times she&#39;s disguised herself as me?&quot; She shivered 
in disgust

&quot;Then I recall one time your mother disguised herself as you and tried 
to seduce me!&quot; We both shivered. &quot;Quick call in the Valkyries! Call in 
Kami! Someone needs to stop her!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time. Let&#39;s find Lind first.&quot; She nodded in agreement. We 
both ran outside and decided to quickly fly everywhere to find her. Urd 
split into her mini-counterparts to hasten our search. Without a plan or 
second thought to it we quickly flew off into the sky, leaving a cloud 
of dust in our trail.

Lind

How odd. The house has a dust cloud covering it. Oh well no use musing 
about it. I held Skuld&#39;s waist lightly in case she fell, but she was 
flying herself the majority of the journey home. We landed outside and 
Keiichi and Belldandy came out to meet us.

&quot;Onee-san! I flew! I can fly&quot; Skuld shouted as she ran to hug her 
sister.

&quot;That&#39;s wonderful Skuld. Did Lind teach you?&quot; asked Belldandy.

&quot;Yeah!&quot;

&quot;She has more access to her power now so a lot of spells should be much 
easier for her,&quot; I said. Skuld ran up to me enthusiastically

&quot;Neh Lind. Can you teach me the spells then?&quot; I gulped.

&quot;Me? Wouldn&#39;t you rather Belldandy or Ur..&quot;

&quot;No way! Not Urd! Belldandy has work and she always needs to look after 
Keiichi in case he gets himself into trouble. And Peorth is technically 
working, so you&#39;re the only one who really has enough free time.&quot;

&quot;...I see no reason not to.&quot;

&quot;YAY!!!! Lind&#39;s going to teach some spells that will kick butt! Then 
I&#39;ll be the one zapping Urd with spells! HAHAHAHHA we&#39;ll see who will be 
laughing at who!&quot; Skuld laughed triumphantly. Hmmm, that&#39;s not really 
the best reason to learn.

I noticed a figure descending from the sky; I thought it was Urd at 
first but as they approached closer I realised it was the Daimakaicho. I 
prepared myself in case a fight would ensue but Belldandy put a hand on 
my shoulder. Hild landed in front of us in her child form and oddly, 
Mara wasn&#39;t with her, probably at work in the convenience store.

&quot;How are all my cute little kittens?&quot; she asked and grinned showing her 
fang.

&quot;We&#39;re fine. Though I cannot say much for my temperament if you have 
malice intent on this visit,&quot; I replied.

&quot;Oh Lind-Chan, moody as ever. Why I&#39;m here to have a talk with you 
especially.&quot;

Peorth

Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? So much for that 
speech she gave me about telling me where she is at all times.

So far, I had scanned my area and I couldn&#39;t sense Lind at all. I 
suppose I had better see how Urd is faring. I honed in on Urd&#39;s energy 
and teleported to where she was. She must have merged into her normal 
form; her energy level was much higher than if she was split into her 
counter parts.

I saw Urd and...was she with Mara? They were deep in conversation and 
seemed to be arguing over something. I approached them and they both 
acknowledged me but simply continued on with their argument.

&quot;You have to listen to me!&quot; yelled Mara. She threw her arm out in 
frustration and her black cape swished behind her.

&quot;No I don&#39;t. Because the last time I listened to you my angel was stolen 
from me and you tried to make me a devil!&quot; Urd shouted back. She crossed 
her arms over her chest and wore that expression of hers that said she&#39;s 
thunderbolt you without a second thought if you angered her.

&quot;I told you I&#39;m sorry about that. I thought I was doing the right 
thing.&quot;

&quot;What? By turning me into a devil against my own will? I choose to be a 
goddess Mara, and if you still can&#39;t get over that after all these years 
then...then I don&#39;t think I can talk to you anymore.&quot;

&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Mara asked with fear in her voice. Odd I&#39;d 
heard her shout, scream and laugh evilly, but hearing a devil like her 
sound fearful and upset even made me feel their pain.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of this Mara. I&#39;m tired of this push and pull game of ours. I 
mean one of us always does something that really hurts the other, we 
argue, and then somehow get back together but then it happens all over 
again. I don&#39;t want to go through this pain anymore. I&#39;ve had enough.&quot; 
Urd paused and I saw her hands grip onto her arms tightly, probably 
scared to lose herself in her emotions. She was fighting back the tears; 
after all proud Urd would never let anyone see her cry... the stubborn 
fool.

In my head, I was screaming, &quot;Don&#39;t do it Urd!&quot; I was one of the rare 
people that knew of their relationship, if you could call it a 
relationship that is. They loved each other that was certain, ever since 
they were young it&#39;s been that way, perhaps not as lovers when they were 
younger but certainly loved each other as friends. Even I don&#39;t know 
when their secret relationship started, but it didn&#39;t surprise me when 
Urd told me. In fact, entirely the opposite, I was waiting for her to 
realise her feelings for the devil. However, one of them always does 
something really stupid to the other. Their intentions are good, but 
it&#39;s always the wrong way to achieve them. In the end, I suppose this 
was the final straw. God knows I don&#39;t want Urd to really break up with 
Mara, but if this is what she wants I have to stick by her.

&quot;Urd come on, I know I&#39;ve done some stupid things but do you really want 
to call it quits?&quot;

&quot;Mara this is goodbye for real now. We can just be a goddess and demon 
and carry on with our jobs as normal&quot; said Urd with a pained expression. 
Mara was phased; she froze for a moment, too shocked to even move. Then 
it hit her like a speeding train.

&quot;Fine! Have it your way!&quot; Mara yelled trying to conceal her tears; she 
always was the more sensitive of the two. She turned around and said 
almost inaudibly to us &quot;Hild-sama has thought of a new way to make all 
of you into devils. She&#39;s going to try to use Lind, but that&#39;s all I 
know. She didn&#39;t tell me the rest since I refused to be a part of 
it...I&#39;d thought I&#39;d warn you first, that&#39;s why I came to find you.&quot; 
With that, she flew off. Urd watched her leave but she didn&#39;t follow.

Only when Urd was sure Mara had really left she broke down in tears. I 
quickly went to hug her and she cried onto my shoulder. I felt useless 
there was nothing I could do to calm her or stop her tears; all I could 
was lend my shoulder. For all our power as goddesses, we&#39;re still as 
weak as humans when it comes to matters of the heart. She pushed me back 
and wiped her tears using her sleeve

&quot;Come on, Lind&#39;s not out here anymore, she&#39;s probably at home.&quot;

&quot;Urd...&quot;

&quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go, both our mother&#39;s are after Lind.&quot; She exclaimed and 
faked a smile.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be strong in front of me you know.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I&#39;m trying to be strong for me.&quot; With that we both flew off 
back home. I want to help her, but she&#39;s right. Our top priority is Lind 
and the safety of Belldandy and Skuld, things are worse than I thought.

Lind

Never in my life would I have thought that I&#39;d be sitting opposite the 
Daimakaicho drinking tea with her, but yet there we were. Skuld sat with 
Belldandy to my right and Keiichi sat on the left. Belldandy was acting 
like the perfect hostess as usual, offering tea and snacks as such, but 
I knew better, I know not to trust demons.

&quot;Oh Bell-chan your so adorable, and you too Skuld chan&quot; exclaimed Hild 
adoringly and pinched her cheek.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; I asked impatiently. I refuse to listen to anymore 
of her small talk and nonsense. She raised her head slowly and stared at 
me with eyes that would have placed fear in anyone else but me. I am her 
doublet after all; I&#39;m perfectly capable of a death stare as well.

&quot;Oh Lind-chan, so impatient all the time.&quot;

&quot;With good reason.&quot;

&quot;So you say. Well I suppose I better cut to the chase, before you 
attempt to cut me right?&quot; she joked, but oh we both knew that I would do 
it without a second thought. This is the woman that caused havoc and 
pain in this household, that almost killed us, that used us in some sick 
experiment...I would eliminate her if I could. If not for my 
insignificant power in comparison to her, I would show her the same pain 
she inflicted on us. Hild took a sip of her tea and continued, &quot;You see 
I heard from a little birdie, literally, that you are a candidate for 
the High Seraph position. Can I just say congratulations Lind-chan I&#39;m 
so proud of you!&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; I replied monotonously.

&quot;It seems you are worthy or being my doublet after all.&quot; Keiich and 
Skuld gasped hearing this, but Belldandy seemed unfazed, she must have 
known on some level. &quot;So I have an idea, why don&#39;t you join me Lind-Chan 
and have the Seraph position for the Demons? No competitions, no 
examiners, no trials, the position is yours. Of course you&#39;d have to 
become a demon.&quot;

&quot;I refuse.&quot; She grinned upon hearing my answer.

&quot;You see, I&#39;d thought you&#39;d say that. So how about I give you a little 
incentive. What if I give you someone that you&#39;ve wanted to find all 
your life? Someone that is the soul reason for your lust and desire for 
more power, someone that changed your life forever.&quot;

&quot;My desire for power is born from the desire of attaining my complete 
angel, not from the desire of finding someone.&quot;

&quot;Oh how adorable.&quot; She chuckled then glared at me evilly &quot;You&#39;ve been so 
consumed in getting your angels that you forgot why you wanted to have 
them in the first place. Think back child, think back into the deepest 
part of your mind, and find that memory of yours that will make what I&#39;m 
saying clear.&quot;

I listened to her cryptic message and did think back. What&#39;s the reason 
I wanted my angels? Did I need my angels&#39; power to find someone? Then it 
hit me. By kami-sama it hit me. The memories of so long ago flooded my 
mind and suddenly I knew who she was talking about. I remember 
everything now.

I&#39;d forgotten the real reason I needed power. I was so absorbed in 
attaining my angels; I began to believe that my want for power was to 
summon them. But really I wanted power to find a demon, I needed my 
angels for that power, and consequently I thought I needed to be 
stronger to summon them. Everything though is done to find him, he who 
changed me forever, he who I shall exact my revenge on.

I remember the blood spilled, the people killed, the screams and the 
shrill laughter of the demon. It won&#39;t stop. The memory just keeps 
replaying itself in my mind, over and over again until the point where I 
think I&#39;ll just go mad. The murder&#39;s I witnessed keep playing in my 
mind...I want to throw up...I was so young when it happened; my 
subconscious had suppressed it, until now. I wish it had stayed 
suppressed, I wish it had. For everyone&#39;s sake, I wish I didn&#39;t 
remember. Now that I recall everything though, I feel pure grief and 
sorrow and not even a gift from Kami-sama will make it go away. 
Something within me awoke.

My hand was shaking, my whole body trembling; I quickly put my tea down 
in case it spilt. What delicious irony. Do I become a demon to find a 
demon? Do I go against everything I&#39;ve ever know just to keep a promise 
to myself? To exact my revenge? There is only one way to rid myself of 
these feelings and be rid of these memories forever and Hild can give 
him to me.

One would think that being good and not evil would come naturally to a 
goddess, but no, we choose to be good that is why we are. Temptation is 
still as strong for us as it is for humans.

&quot;Can you really give him to me?&quot; I asked, still trembling.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m so happy you remember now! Of course, I can give him to you, 
easy as that. I don&#39;t care what happens to him, so you can do what you 
like with no consequences. All you have to do is join me. What do you 
say?&quot; she said and grinned madly again.

&quot;Of course Lind won&#39;t join you!&quot; exclaimed Skuld looking at me. I 
couldn&#39;t look at her, I couldn&#39;t look into those innocent eyes and tell 
her I wouldn&#39;t join Hild, because really I was considering it...I&#39;m a 
failure of a goddess. If she heard the screams of pain or see the pools 
of blood, she would understand why I&#39;m considering Hild&#39;s offer. 
However, I would never tell anyone of what I remember, it is not their 
burden to bear, it is mine and mine alone.

&quot;Can you feel it Lind? Can you feel the hate welling up inside you till 
you think you&#39;re going to burst? You&#39;ll never be rid of this feeling, 
never, unless you have my help. The particular demon you&#39;re after has 
gone into hiding and only I know his whereabouts. So what do you say?&quot;

&quot;I cannot give you an answer now, I need time to think,&quot; I said 
trembling slightly. Everyone looked at me shocked. I feel so ashamed to 
have disappointed them so, but I cannot focus on them now, I must think 
for me for once.

&quot;No.&quot; Hild replied bluntly, &quot;You will give me an answer now.&quot;

&quot;I told you I need time to think&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately this offer of mine has a time limit, so I need an answer 
now.&quot; She cackled evilly, the sound shrill enough to send shivers up my 
spine. &quot;This is why you&#39;re my favourite Lind! You see I always knew 
there was something special about you when I found out you had two 
angels. Your angels represent you Lind, so having two, that must mean 
you have two personalities. Or you have two sides to you. Think of all 
the possibilities. Perhaps it&#39;s that something caused you to break down 
just enough to reconfigure your angel. And with that new reconfiguration 
a little hate was born in your heart bearing you two angels. You&#39;re a 
goddess yet not entirely good or evil. Given enough incentive and 
encouragement, dare I say you could become evil...a demon. Mah it&#39;s only 
an idea though.&quot;

Is she right? Is that the reason I have two angels? Did that memory 
break me down so much that my angel changed as well? Curses! Curse her 
for making me think like this. She really is the Daimakaicho if she if 
able to make me doubt myself. I...I am a First class goddess! I will not 
be beaten by her mind games. I will not give in to her temptation or 
bribery, no matter how great. I can find that demon myself, now that I 
remember my true motif for power, I will find him myself.

&quot;I refuse Hild-sama.&quot; I said proudly. Skuld smiled and hugged me 
quickly. &quot;I had a weak moment just now, but rest assured that I won&#39;t 
anymore. I will never join the demons.&quot; Hild seemed bored not 
disappointed upon hearing me. She stood up and opened the doors to the 
garden and stepped out. She turned around and grinned then flew off not 
before saying all too clearly &quot;But you considered it though didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Curses. She had opened the floodgates to my memories, and despite acting 
strong and confidant, I&#39;m scared. The memories won&#39;t leave me. Such tear 
jerking, gut-wrenching memories of my childhood won&#39;t leave me. It 
throbs in my mind like a time bomb and won&#39;t leave. No matter how much I 
will it, the thoughts won&#39;t leave me. It won&#39;t go away.

Peorth

We arrived back later than expected. Urd decided to take her anguish out 
on some mountains by performing destructive spell after spell. I think 
Kami-sama decided to overlook the fact that she was doing spells outside 
her ranking, perhaps he knows of her pain as well.

Upon arriving home Urd flew to her room immediately. I landed onto the 
grass and slowly walked inside the house. I prayed that my mother wasn&#39;t 
inside. Making my way to the living room where I knew everyone would be 
I heard Urd. How odd, Urd just flew to her room, I saw her. Oh no...this 
must mean. I slid open the doors.

&quot;Ah Peorth, you&#39;re back already? Urd said you&#39;d be another few hours&quot; 
said Belldandy naively as usual. I looked at the Urd sitting in the 
living room and knew straight away it wasn&#39;t her. Though the image was a 
perfect replication, I knew there was no way she would be so happy after 
such a break up. I summoned Gorgeous rose and muttered the counter 
spell, and slowly fake Urd showed her true form. Light gathered around 
her body and spun until she revealed herself to be my mother. Her hair 
was tied up in a bun and she wore her usual red robes, sleeveless with a 
giant V cut on the front and long gloves. Great everyone&#39;s met my whole 
circus family now.

&quot;Oh Peorth-Chan your no fun&quot; my mother whined. She stood up and bowed 
formally &quot;Sorry for deceiving you everyone, but I am actually Peorth&#39;s 
mother, Sera.&quot; Skuld bombarded her with questions which gave me time to 
scan the room, Lind was sitting away from the group, and she seemed 
upset. Other people wouldn&#39;t be able to tell because she&#39;s always so 
quiet, but I can tell, I can always tell. I went and sat next to her and 
she smiled weakly at her. Oh god, has my mother already attacked Lind?

&quot;Ahem, everyone. If you wouldn&#39;t mind, could you give Peorth, Lind and I 
some private time?&quot; my mother said. They all nodded and left the living 
room closing the door behind them.

&quot;Mother! What did you do to Lind?!&quot;

&quot;Surprisingly enough I did nothing Peorth. You see Lind here had a 
little visit from the Daimakaicho today.&quot;

&quot;What happened? Are you ok?&quot; I asked Lind frantically.

&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; she replied.

&quot;Peorth you see I have an ulterior motive to visiting you today. Because 
of certain abilities I possess I was chosen to examine all the 
candidates for their second trial. I delve into the candidates minds and 
tempt them things they&#39;ve desired all their lives. It is temptation at 
its purest, temptation so great that it would break their resolve as 
goddesses.&quot;

&quot;And? Did Lind pass?&quot;

&quot;No. You see in some rare coincidence the Daimakaicho did my job for me. 
She tempted Lind with something on the condition that she joined the 
demons. Lind considered joining them before rejecting her.&quot;

&quot;You considered?&quot; I exclaimed, shocked that Lind would think such a 
thing.

&quot;Yes, and I am ashamed of my actions.&quot;

&quot;Even though she declined the offer, the very fact she considered it 
means she has failed her second trial. She&#39;s not out of the running just 
yet though so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t even have considered her offer. I am not worthy to be a 
candidate,&quot; Lind said staring at my mother.

&quot;Lind if you weren&#39;t worthy enough do you think my husband would have 
chosen you? Do you think we would even let you date Peorth if you 
weren&#39;t worthy?&quot;

&quot;...no.&quot;

&quot;Exactly. Right now though I&#39;m not worried about the trial, I&#39;m worried 
about your well-being. I&#39;m afraid the Daimakaicho delved a little too 
far into your mind and now your memories haunt you am I right?&quot;

&quot;My memories are now as clear as dawn. I can think of nothing else.&quot;

&quot;The Daimakaicho my have placed a mind block on you. Unfortunately, 
there&#39;s nothing I can do about that, you will have to help yourself, but 
I will give you some advice. Revenge and hate only bears more revenge 
and hate.&quot;

We sat in silence for a while and I held Lind&#39;s hand and squeezed it 
affectionately. Suddenly a big flash of light filled the room blinding 
me for a second. Once I had regained my vision, I saw my mother with a 
camera in hand.

&quot;What was that for?!&quot; I exclaimed at her. Now really isn&#39;t a time to 
take pictures.

&quot;My photo album. You see I&#39;ve made a Peorth x Lind photo album for you 
to have to look back on later in life. Aren&#39;t I a wonderful mother?&quot; 
Sigh, my mother is such a stalker; she did the exact same thing to my 
older sister and her husband.

&quot;Sera-Sama, how many photos of us do you have? You see Peorth and I are 
very private about our lives&quot; said Lind.

&quot;Why my photo album is half full already! You see I buy the pictures off 
the person who uploads the pictures of you two onto the dating polls.&quot;

&quot;Urd&quot; we both muttered.

&quot;You two have made me so much money lately on the polls.&quot;

&quot;I bet that&#39;s why you&#39;re not causing a fuss over us dating,&quot; I muttered.

&quot;What did you say?&quot; My mother exclaimed evilly. Her eyes practically 
turned red and I realised I was about to endure her divine punishment.

&quot;Nothing, nothing!&quot; I quickly said, inching nearer and nearer to the 
door for my escape root.

&quot;WHAT? LYING TO MY FACE?! I SEE YOU STILL NEED TO LEARN SOME MANNERS!&quot; 
She yelled and suddenly she seemed to be standing 10feet tall, towering 
above me. I quickly slid the door opened and ran outside into the 
garden. Oh crap, oh crap oh crap! &quot;VALENTINE!&quot; she yelled summoning 
forth her angel. And in the blink of an eye I was running in circles 
around the garden evading thousands of thorn whips that were trying to 
thrash me. &quot;HOHOHOHOHO&quot; my mother laughed.

Lind

...I don&#39;t believe what I&#39;m watching. Is this for real? Is there 
actually a person scarier than Peorth when she&#39;s mad?...What in 
Kami-sama&#39;s name will I be marrying into? I had better buy some life 
insurance now.

Peorth

After my mother was happy with my new manner&#39;s she bid us adieu and left 
laughing at the sight of my face. I managed to evade all of her attacks 
but stupidly I ran into a tree...hey it could happen to anyone alright?

Everyone had retreated to their rooms for the night. I sat snuggled 
under Lind&#39;s arm as we sat up in bed talking about the day. She seemed 
like her usual self until I brought up Hild into the conversation.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand Lind. What could she tempt you with that would make 
you consider becoming a demon?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Lind?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to say. I&#39;m ashamed to even think about it.&quot;

&quot;I know you&#39;re ashamed about it, but you resisted in the end. So can you 
tell me please?&quot; I lifted her arm off me and straddled her so I could 
face her directly. &quot;Please?&quot; I asked again purposely staring into her 
eyes; she&#39;s a sucker for the eyes.

&quot;Fine&quot; she exclaimed glumly &quot;Hild offered me a demon. Easy as that she 
would give him to me and I would be able to do what I wish to him.&quot;

&quot;What makes this demon so special?&quot;

&quot;He ruined everything I ever came to know. He is even the cause of my 
memories haunting me now.&quot; I leaned forward and kissed her forehead and 
sat down again.

&quot;Will your memories leave you now?&quot;

&quot;No. If a mere kiss would make them leave my mind I would have done so 
long ago.&quot; In pure agony, Lind pressed her head onto my shoulder and 
gripped my waist tightly. &quot;The screams and tears won&#39;t leave my mind. It 
won&#39;t stop,&quot; she cried out. I hugged her and stroked her back lightly.

&quot;Oh Lind. Talk to me about it. I&#39;m here for you.&quot;

&quot;You of all people should not be exposed to the horrors of my past.&quot;

&quot;I am your girlfriend Lind. I love you regardless of your past. So tell 
me, let me share your burden.&quot; Lind loosened her grip on me and looked 
up with glistening eyes. &quot;Tell me what makes the proud Valkyrie Lind 
teary eyed?&quot;

&quot;The burden to bear is mine Peorth. You wouldn&#39;t understand my pain.&quot;

&quot;How can you say that? You&#39;re right I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to 
completely understand, but I&#39;ll be able to support you, to help you. You 
can trust me with this you know?&quot;

&quot;I will tell you Peorth, but not now. Do not make me relive it more than 
I already am,&quot; she pleaded. I nodded my head. I understand her sentiment 
but I&#39;m also disappointed. &quot;Just let me hold you and hopefully I&#39;ll have 
a peaceful dream,&quot; she said almost inaudibly.

We lay down and she help onto me firmly, it was as if she was worried I 
would disappear. I rested my head against her as usual and our legs 
intertwined. Lind fell asleep first, I could tell from the light snoring 
I heard. She must be so tired. Poor soul.

Hild&#39;s words have broken Lind and now her memories terrify her and haunt 
her mind constantly. I feel useless, absolutely useless. Lind is 
suffering and I can do nothing to help her, there is nothing I can do to 
ease her pain. She won&#39;t even tell me what it is that&#39;s bothering her. 
If I could make it so that she would be happy and smile I would, god 
knows I would, but such things can&#39;t happen. Lind needs time, and I&#39;m 
not going to rush her simply because I feel inadequate because I can&#39;t 
help her. I&#39;ll give her time, all the time she needs. Even...Even if 
Lind tries to distance herself from me I&#39;ll still give her time. I will 
always be waiting until she can freely tell me what plagues her mind. 
Because love is endearing...our love is endearing.
