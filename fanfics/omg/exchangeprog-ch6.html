My body went stiff and rigid. My eyes scrunched in the weirdest fashion 
and my lips pressed together. Oh for the love of god of all the traps in 
the world I have to walk into.

Though my body couldn&#39;t move my eyes quickly looked around everywhere 
for the culprit. Those chocolates on Lind&#39;s desk certainly weren&#39;t from 
me which is why I ate one. Then I saw my culprit in her mini form 
floating in the hallway, watching me and grinning madly. URD! I shall 
have my vengeance! She waved at me and I saw she was holding something 
behind her back. My eyes widened in realisation when she brought the 
object forward. A small red beam of light shone at me as she hit the 
record button and started filming.

I unwillingly took a single step forward causing Mist and Lind to 
flinch. Gritting my teeth I used all of my will power to stop moving, I 
wasn&#39;t going to allow Urd to humiliate me like this!

&quot;Peorth we have reason to believe those chocolates I was sent were 
cursed&quot; said Lind in her stoic way.

&quot;Obviously we were right not to eat them!&quot; said Mist as she cowered 
behind the other Valkyrie.

Again I moved a step forward as the curse overwhelmed me.

&quot;Wahh I&#39;m getting outta here!&quot; Yelled Mist as she bolted out of the room 
as fast the wind. Is the thought of kissing me really such a dreadful 
thing to her? She should be honoured but such a prospect! Well I suppose 
now that&#39;s she&#39;s out of the room this curse&#39;s effect should stop. I 
tried to move my leg, but it didn&#39;t budge. Then I tried waving my hand, 
still nothing. I tried to open my mouth but my lips still stuck 
together. Oh crap. This curse wasn&#39;t aimed at Mist, it was aimed at 
Lind! My eyes shifted around madly as I tried to warn Lind.

&quot;As stubborn as you are Peorth, you can&#39;t fight such a powerful curse,&quot; 
Said Lind as she closed the door. Urd snapped her fingers in frustration 
before she disappeared in a puff of smoke.

&quot;I believe I have discovered how to rid you of this curse. Shall I 
administer the cure?&quot; YES!! &quot;I shall proceed. I apologise if it is 
unpleasant.&quot; She stood in front of me and held onto my shoulders. What 
is she going to do? Run a vaccine? Administer an anti virus? Destroy the 
source of the curse? Destroy Urd? I closed my eyes and awaited my cure 
whilst still trying to maintain my hold over the curse. I didn&#39;t feel 
Lind move for a while, but then I felt it.

Soft lips pressed against my own in a gentle kiss. My eyes opened in 
shock and my heart pounded wildly.

Lind, I wish this never stops. I felt my body relaxing and I regained 
control of my limbs, the curse had been removed. Our lips parted and she 
let go of me. I stumbled backwards and held onto a desk to support my 
weight. I could tell there was an evident blush on my face.

&quot;Lind...&quot; I whispered

&quot;I apologise, I shouldn&#39;t have.&quot; My head shot up to see a slight frown; 
did she think I was upset?

&quot;No, no don&#39;t apologise. I would have done the same thing!&quot; I quickly 
blurted out. I mentally slapped myself, but luckily she thought nothing 
of me comment.

&quot;The curses objective was to get you to kiss someone, so the simple 
answer is to give it what it wants. It was only a kiss after all.&quot;

&quot;Oh...yes only a simple kiss&quot; It meant nothing to her. She went back 
down to sit in her chair and threw the box of chocolates into a bin.

&quot;If the curse was a killing curse, well that would have been a different 
story...&quot; she joked.

&quot;Gomen Lind I just remembered I had to be somewhere.&quot; I interrupted and 
quickly dashed off.

&quot;Peorth, Peorth!&quot; she shouted. I ignored her, as much as I loved Lind 
she was such a blockhead at times. She always takes the route which will 
give her results, sometimes not even thinking about who her choice is 
affecting.

----------

I sat in the operations room on what used to be my chair, with Urd 
floating in front of me. I had explained everything that happened after 
she had left, despite placing a curse on me I knew Urd really had the 
best intentions.

&quot;Ohhhh! Why did you bolt out of the room?&quot; I sighed aloud and sunk into 
the chair. &quot;What&#39;s the matter? She kissed you isn&#39;t that what you 
wanted?&quot;

&quot;Yes but... to her it meant nothing. She kissed me out of her sense of 
duty not because she likes me.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s Lind. She cares for her friends deeply yes, and when their 
in a crisis she finds the most efficient way to help them. But sometimes 
she doesn&#39;t realise that the most efficient way is the wrong way. Stupid 
Valkyrie efficiency.&quot; I sighed out loudly again and summoned a pot of 
ice cream and ate if furiously.

&quot;Mah well this didn&#39;t turn out how I planned. Matchmaking is hard&quot; 
complaint Urd. She summoned a spoon and instinctively I passed her the 
pot of ice cream. It seemed sort of a tradition for us to eat ice cream 
whenever the other was upset about love. However, since our love lives 
were pretty much dead it had been a long time since we shared some.

&quot;I&#39;ve given up matchmaking her and Mist. She&#39;s too smart to fall for the 
chocolates.&quot;

&quot;Unlike you&quot; muttered Urd.

&quot;What was that?&quot; I glared but she ignored me. &quot;I just want to know who 
she likes now. Just so I can just get over her.&quot;

&quot;Liar!&quot; she yelled and pointed the spoon at me, accidentally flicking 
ice cream on my face. &quot;You want to know who she likes so you can beat 
them to a pulp&quot; She knows me too well. &quot;Fortunately for you though we 
can find out.&quot;

&quot;What? How?!&quot; I almost screamed. Urd simply grinned at me and summoned 
glasses in an attempt to look smart.

&quot;Now now unlike your little chocolates which made you kiss a specific 
person. My Urd brand chocolates makes the person kiss whoever they like 
the most. Now when you ate them you wanted to kiss Lind, am I right?&quot; I 
nodded. &quot;Well now all we do is wait for the effect to kick in on Lind.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t,&quot; I gasped suddenly realising what she had done. She was 
such a genius at times. Did I just call Urd a genius? What is the world 
coming to?!

&quot;Yes I did, it&#39;s contagious. Meaning since she kissed you, Lind now has 
the curse. So all we have to do is wait until she jumps on someone!&quot;

&quot;HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO&quot; We both triumphantly laughed.

&quot;In return for my excellence you must do my paper work.&quot; She commanded

&quot;Cheh! Do it yourself slacker&quot; I said and stuck my toungue out at her.

&quot;Hmph, better to be a slacker than a rose obsessed stalker&quot; she mumbled.

&quot;What did you say? you potion maniac!&quot; I yelled and stood up, quickly 
summoning Gorgeous Rose.

&quot;You heard me. S-T-A-L-K-E-R!&quot; She yelled back and summoned World of 
elegance.

&quot;Wha! You shall suffer my divine punishment!&quot; I raised my arms and 
prepared a spell to attack.

&quot;Bring it Stalker-chan!&quot; We both launched our spells at each other at 
the same time. Fire and thorns against lightning filled the room. Then 
just as my spell was about to burn her to a crisp some force blocked it.

&quot;Who&#39;s interfering?&quot; Yelled Urd when she realised her spell had been 
blocked as well. Blocking such, high level spells as ours in no easy 
feat, only two people could take us both on at the same time. Belldandy 
was on earth so that left...

&quot;It was me,&quot; bellowed a deep voice from above us. Urd face faulted and 
turned shakily to me and pointed upwards, to which I nodded. We quickly 
knelt down, both of us quivering next to each other. &quot;No fighting in the 
Operations room please.&quot;

&quot;Hai! Kami-sama!&quot; We shouted and stood up to salute.

&quot;You&#39;re still a stalker&quot; Urd whispered and grinned at me menacingly.

&quot;You&#39;re still a potion manic&quot; I replied back.

----------

In Lind&#39;s office Urd and I, in mini form, waited patiently for &quot;the 
moment&quot; as she had dubbed it. So far three people had been struck off 
out list, Mist, Senya and a young trainee. The Valkyries were all 
talking about some boring battle formation, when I noticed an odd smell. 
I turned to look at Urd and face faulted, then sighed out deeply. Using 
a small fire spell and somehow some mini kitchen utensils, she was 
making ramen.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

&quot;Making steak and ramen. What else do you do on a stake out?&quot;

&quot;U-R-D! You&#39;re really trying my patience!&quot; I yelled and dismissed 
everything she had summoned

&quot;MY RAMEN!&quot; She screamed. With tears in her eyes she glared at me

&quot;Hahahaha! The look on your face!&quot; I laughed and clenched my sides. 
Suddenly I felt a surge of energy pass my face, curse her she just threw 
a lightning bolt at me! I summoned Gorgeous rose and prepared my attack. 
We circled each other like predatory animals

&quot;Ouch!&quot; said Senya as she grabbed her arm. Urd and I looked at each 
other and slowly backed off into a corner holding each other in fear of 
being caught.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Asked Mist

&quot;Static electricity I think.&quot;

We both sighed out in relief and made a promise not to attack each 
other. If someone caught us, especially a Valkyrie, well, we would be in 
deep trouble.

We finally stopped for the day when Urd realised she still hadn&#39;t done 
her paper work. I opted to help her but she oddly declined. With nothing 
else to do, I returned to my quarters. I lay on my bed of smooth red 
silk and wrapped my self with the quilt. Day 1 is over but soon I&#39;ll 
find out who you love. Whether it will be good for me to find out I 
don&#39;t know, but I need to know. I need closure and either way closure I 
will get.
