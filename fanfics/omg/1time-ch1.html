<h1>The First Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/justjun.html">JustJun</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The first time I laid eyes upon Peorth, I couldn&#39;t help but be entranced 
by her. Such an amazing woman I thought. She is somewhat evil and 
slightly proud at times, I admit but she&#39;s kind, beautiful, funny, and 
generous, the list could go on for an eternity. We both met when we both 
worked on a mission together, we hit it off straight away, conversing 
about all things known to man. I think I had a crush on her the moment 
we met.

The first time we kissed was when I had a cold. I couldn&#39;t eat nor 
sleep, I couldn&#39;t do anything. And despite me saying I felt fine and 
that I could resume my duties as a Valkyrie no one would believe me. 
Once Peorth realised why I was spending so much time in admin she rushed 
me to her quarters. Why to her quarters I never knew, I suppose it was 
so she could take care of me. She tucked me into her bed and even gave 
me sickeningly cute pyjamas with rose patterns on. Then I closed my eyes 
and rested my head, maybe I was ill I thought. Then I felt her weight 
sit on the bed as well, but thought nothing of it. She shifted slightly 
and soon felt a pair of lips pressed onto mine. I couldn&#39;t believe what 
was happening. When she pulled away, I started coughing feeling the 
newly transmitted vaccine in my throat. She just laughed at me and I 
soon realised I needed the vaccine once every two hours, Kami-sama help 
me I thought.

The first time I told her I loved her was after we both had a huge 
fight. Peorth wanted to go on a dangerous mission to capture a wanted 
demon, of course I wouldn&#39;t allow it. We argued for hours about if she 
should or shouldn&#39;t go on the mission. Until finally we were both tired 
and worn out and she plain out asked me &quot;Why do you care so much 
anyway?&quot; To which I replied because &quot;I love you.&quot; Needless to say, but 
she was shocked. She wasn&#39;t repulsed in any way like I had expected, in 
fact she started crying. I tried to comfort her fearing I may have 
ruined our relationship forever even she tackled me to the ground and 
showered me in kisses.

The first time I cried in her presence was when the Angel eater had 
stolen her angel. I went there for no reason and endangered her; I&#39;ll 
never forgive myself for that. Later that evening I went to check up on 
her so many times, hoping she would awaken even though I knew she 
wouldn&#39;t. I would do anything just to hear the sound of her voice again, 
anything. My knees fell down hard upon the fall, collapsing under the 
weight of my distress. I had failed. Countless times in heaven I told 
her I wouldn&#39;t let anything bad ever happen to her, but yet there she 
was lying unconscious without an angel. Carefully cupping her cheek with 
my hand like she was a frail china doll I cried fast falling tears. I 
swore I would put this right.

The first time we made love was definitely one of the most important 
days I&#39;ll ever remember. Me being me, our relationship was slow, of 
course not as slow as Keichi&#39;s and Belldandy. Peorth said she wanted to 
wait until I was ready, so I set the pace of our relationship. A little 
kiss and hug hear and there was sufficient for me. Then I began to 
notice her more. Its not that I didn&#39;t think Peorth wasn&#39;t pretty but 
for some reason she just glowed everytime I looked at her. I wanted to 
hold her against me and never let her go I wanted to love her in 
everyway possible. So I took her to her favourite place and kissed her, 
held her, caressed her and made love to her, until we finally tired and 
slept. It was amazing. I later found out that the reason she was glowing 
was literally, because she was glowing. Urd had thrown some weird 
medicine into her mouth causing her to be a living light bulb. I made a 
mental note to send Urd some roses later that day.

So there we were in a grand field in a secluded part of heaven. I was 
lying down and she lay down next to me with her head on my chest. I idly 
played with her hair with one hand whilst she traced patterns on my 
stomach. I loved nothing more than just lounging around with Peorth, if 
I could I would do it all the time. But we&#39;re separate people, no matter 
how much we want to we can&#39;t really become one being. We have separate 
lives, separate friends, and separate homes even. Then it hit me, I know 
what to do. Casually I sat up and she moved her head to rest on my lap. 
I held onto her left hand and intertwined our fingers. I leant down 
slightly and my hair trickled against her neck which caused her to 
giggle. Smiling widely I whispered into her ear

&quot;Be mine forever.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question, I knew what her answer would 
be, I could read her mind. Elegantly I created a ring from my magic and 
placed it on that ever so important finger. She sat up quickly and 
gasped, stating at the ring in disbelief. It was made from ever lasting 
Ice; the band shone brightly and sparkled, and of course, there were 
three red heartstring crystals, her birthstone. She seemed incapable to 
form a sentence she just kept smiling and giggling to herself.

Then I found myself being tackled to the ground and being kissed like 
never before. It was tender and sweet yet with a great lust and ferocity 
as she tugged at my bottom lip. God she&#39;s amazing. Eventually due to the 
lack of oxygen she released me from her tender grip. She straddled me 
then leant her head down so our foreheads were touching. Peorth leant 
down slightly and whispered into my ear

&quot;Forever isn&#39;t long enough.&quot; Yes, nothing could be better than this
