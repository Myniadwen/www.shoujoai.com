<h1>The Ladies Retreat (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../omg/index.html">Ah My Goddess</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../omg/ladretreat-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The late afternoon was filled up with Chihiro&#39;s version of club 
activities, mostly consisting of all of them riding their motorcycles 
around the lake in improvised races with Chieko offering snacks and 
refreshments as needed. Urd picked up on riding a cycle remarkably fast, 
and despite a few false starts Sora began to show some real signs of 
improvement. Still, most of the races went to the three aces in the 
group: Chihiro, Megumi and Natsuki.
 
&quot;You know,&quot; Chihiro sounded almost disgusted, &quot;I was a professional 
motorcycle racer at one time, and I still have a hard time keeping ahead 
of you two.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Natsuki flashed her a grin before adding modestly, &quot;but I 
think I still have a lot to learn from Megumi.&quot;
 
Megumi actually blushed, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;
 
Urd chuckled to herself softly. From what she heard from Belldandy, 
Megumi had beaten Natsuki and her customized racing bike twice, all 
while riding her own old, off the lot model. In a final race between 
Belldandy and Keiichi Natsuki had finally come to understand why Megumi 
could beat her, and in the end had surrendered the Queen title to 
Megumi.
 
&quot;I ought to haul you two out onto the racing circuit,&quot; Chihiro plotted 
devilishly, &quot;I bet we&#39;d make a killing.&quot; A impish little grin, &quot;And you 
can all wear the Whirlwind insignia on your uniforms, it&#39;d be great 
advertising.&quot;
 
&quot;You would think of that,&quot; Urd joked.
 
&quot;Let&#39;s wait till we graduate,&quot; Megumi said firmly, Natsuki nodding in 
agreement.
 
It was Sora who gave Urd and Chieko the opening they needed when the 
younger woman said thoughtfully, &quot;I almost wish that Keiichi were here 
with the Brough Superior, it&#39;d make these races even more interesting.&quot;
 
&quot;A Brough Superior?&quot; Chihiro&#39;s eyes lit up with interest, &quot;That&#39;s the 
Rolls Royce of Motorcycles! I couldn&#39;t imagine Keiichi having one.&quot;
 
&quot;I think it belonged to the family here or maybe to a former guest,&quot; Urd 
offered smoothly, &quot;Keiichi fixed it up then took Chieko for a ride.&quot;
 
&quot;Wow,&quot; Natsuki blinked in awe, even the modern young rider having heard 
about the very expensive classic bike.
 
&quot;D&#39;you think we could see it?&quot; Megumi asked Chieko eagerly.
 
Chieko handed out the drinks as she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think it would be a 
problem. Would you like to go first?&quot;
 
Megumi shook her head, surprising them all as she suggested, &quot;Why 
doesn&#39;t Chihiro go first? Then we can all go have a look.&quot;
 
With a bounce in her step Chihiro followed Chieko into the lodge even as 
Urd looked at Megumi curiously, &quot;Why not you?&quot;
 
Megumi shrugged, &quot;Well, Chihiro was so excited by it....&quot;
 
&quot;Occasionally, you really are a bit too much like Keiichi,&quot; a smiling 
Urd noted, &quot;too kind for your own good.&quot;
 
Sora, surprisingly, was giving Megumi a thoughtful look, a faint blush 
on her cheeks as she said, &quot;I think so, too.&quot;
 
Rather surprisingly Chihiro returned a few moment&#39;s later, her 
expression thoughtful. &quot;So what&#39;s it like?&quot; Natsuki asked.
 
&quot;It&#39;s a beauty,&quot; Chihiro nodded, &quot;I was even tempted to take it out for 
a ride.&quot; A pause, &quot;But it so... clearly belonged to someone else, I 
couldn&#39;t do it.&quot;
 
&quot;This I gotta see,&quot; Natsuki smiled, also following Chieko off. She 
returned after a short time, her own expression rueful. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; 
she admitted to Chihiro, &quot;I even tried to climb on it, but it just felt 
too wrong.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s my turn,&quot; Megumi said, smiling over at Chieko as 
they walked to the lodge together. &quot;Thank you for letting us impose like 
this,&quot; she added softly.
 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Chieko felt a prickling of painful emotion as she led 
Megumi through the house to the room that the bike was stored in. &#39;The 
other girls weren&#39;t right,&#39; she thought, &#39;maybe I was wrong about 
Hotaru&#39;s spirit being nearby?&#39; She opened the door and led Megumi down 
the stairs, into the room where the bike had waited so patiently.
 
&quot;Wow,&quot; Megumi breathed out, walking forward to touch the older bike. &quot;An 
SS100AGS,&quot; she murmured, stroking the seat like a lover, &quot;they only 
built 281 of this model with a J.A.P. engine.&quot; She looked up at Chieko, 
&quot;Could I take her out?&quot;
 
Chieko met her eyes and felt all her worries leave her, recognizing the 
look in the young woman&#39;s eyes. &#39;Hotaru&#39;s spirit lives on in her,&#39; she 
felt warmly satisfied, &#39;he has returned to me at last.&#39; Aloud she said, 
&quot;Of course, but could you take me on a ride around the lake?&quot;
 
&quot;I was going to suggest it,&quot; Megumi had the oddest look on her face as 
they took the bike outside, &quot;it&#39;s almost like a promise I needed to 
keep.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Chihiro blinked as Megumi rushed by them on the 
motorcycle, Chieko happily perched behind her, &quot;I guess someone belongs 
on that bike after all.&quot;
 
&quot;Keiichi could ride it too,&quot; Urd quickly supplied the information before 
the three girls could speculate too much, &quot;maybe it&#39;s a family thing.&quot;
 
Chieko smiled in contentment as they rode, her cheek against the warmth 
of Megumi&#39;s back. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured as they drove, swinging 
around the corners gracefully with the engine throbbing happily beneath 
them.
 
&quot;We&#39;re coming back up on the lodge again,&quot; Megumi called back to her 
passenger, &quot;do you want to do another lap?&quot;
 
&quot;This was enough,&quot; Chieko murmured, then she surprised Megumi by leaning 
forward and pressing her soft lips to Megumi&#39;s cheek, &quot;I&#39;ll never forget 
this, ever.&quot; Then, softly and silently, Chieko simply seemed to fade 
away.
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Megumi blinked in surprise and distress as she came to a stop, 
realizing that her passenger had disappeared.
 
&lt;OoOoO&gt;
 
As they were packing up to go home on the last day of their retreat 
Chihiro repeated, &quot;So she really was some kind of ghost?&quot;
 
&quot;Yup,&quot; Urd nodded firmly, &quot;she had been haunting the place until her 
lover returned to give her a ride on that bike. We thought Keiichi doing 
it the last time was enough, but I guess Megumi needed to reinforce it.&quot;
 
&quot;Do you think anyone would mind my taking the Superior?&quot; Megumi asked, 
standing beside the classic bike.
 
&quot;No, it&#39;s clearly yours,&quot; Sora said firmly from where she was 
uncomfortably sitting on Keiichi&#39;s bike. With the sidecar attached to it 
was the easiest of the cycles to ride, so they felt it was safest for 
her to handle.
 
Sensing the other woman&#39;s hesitation Natsuki smiled over at Sora, 
&quot;You&#39;ll be all right.&quot; A bit more hesitantly she offered, &quot;I could even 
give you some more riding lessons when we get home.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; Sora blushed.
 
Chihiro tried to hide her wicked grin, finally understanding why the two 
girls had spent so much time alone over the past week. &quot;All right,&quot; she 
waved after everyone had mounted up on their bikes, &quot;let&#39;s move out!&quot;
 
Megumi lingered a moment, looking back at the lodge. &quot;I just wish I had 
gotten to know Chieko better,&quot; she sighed, &quot;it almost felt like I had 
loved her once, so long ago.&quot; She kick started the bike and was off, 
following the others.
 
Invisibly Chieko smiled and wrapped her insubstantial arms around Megumi 
as they came up alongside Urd and Chihiro. &#39;I didn&#39;t realize that my 
spirit had become bound to the bike.&#39; she thought, exchanging a sly wink 
with Urd. Impishly she smiled, &#39;I wonder how Megumi is going to react 
the first time I manifest in her home?&#39;
 
The End...?
 
Notes: This story is based around the story &quot;The Forgotten Promise&quot; from 
Oh My Goddess Manga #8. I thought that the situation of the spirit 
Chieko Honda was interesting, and I was a bit disappointed by how 
quickly she was dealt with. I&#39;ve been thinking of writing a shoujoai 
story with Megumi Morisato for a while, so I decided to combine them.
 
&quot;The Queen&quot; is another one-shot character who was introduced in The 
Secret of Speed from Oh My Goddess Part 10, when she raced against 
Megumi. I like the obscure characters, huh? Oddly she&#39;s never NAMED, so 
I pretty much had to make something up. I may or may not continue 
this....</pre>
