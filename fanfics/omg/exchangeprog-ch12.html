&quot;Damn angel eater!&quot; shouted Urd as she started pacing around the room. I 
watched her and floated in the air cross legged. In all honesty, we 
didn&#39;t understand why we were still alive, if you could call us alive 
that is. We were currently in an ethereal form similar to a ghost as 
humans call them. Our spirits had manifested as a weak form of energy 
that portrays a transparent version of our physical beings. So as my 
body lay tucked up nicely in a blanket I floated in the same room as did 
Urd since her body lay next to mine. Since we are so weak in power, we 
can&#39;t even be more than 30cm away from our bodies. If we do move far 
away (as Urd kindly demonstrated when I pushed her), our spirit will 
slowly start to vanish. So I&#39;m not going to do much moving.

This weak spirit manifestation is called Goddess emergency mode or at 
least that&#39;s what we think it&#39;s called. There is no real name for this 
occurrence since most people never return to their body so the 
experience is never documented. I can&#39;t say the idea of spending my 
eternity following my body sounds exactly fun, so right now I&#39;m trying 
to stay calm and hope someone will help us.

Again Urd smiled wickedly as another idea popped into her head. She 
floated up to the ceiling and dropped down aiming for her body only to 
be repelled off and hit the wall.

&quot;Urd just sit down and wait patiently.&quot;

&quot;How can I wait patiently when my mother is out there?&quot; she replied 
hastily. Despite the fact we can&#39;t separate from our bodies it doesn&#39;t 
mean we can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside. We heard everything, from 
the moment our own angels were stolen until now. Everyone is in such a 
peril situation and yet there&#39;s nothing we can do to help.

&quot;She can&#39;t kill them. The doublet system is still in place&quot;

&quot;But still I don&#39;t want my sisters to be stuck in this situation. I&#39;m a 
ghost for goodness sake! Skuld is scared of ghosts she&#39;ll become scared 
of herself&quot; I smiled lightly, Urd is such a softy at times. &quot;Oi! What 
are you laughing at? This isn&#39;t a time to be laughing you should be 
worried. Lind is out there too you know.&quot;

&quot;I know. And of course I&#39;m worried but I also know she&#39;s going to do 
everything in her power to rectify the problem.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just giddy because she carried your body into the room bridal 
style&quot; said Urd. She rolled her eyes as I grinned even more. Of course 
I&#39;m giddy, Lind won&#39;t even give me a piggy back ride and yet she carried 
me bridal style into the room and covered me in a blanket. I&#39;m so going 
to tease her after...If there is an after that is. I know she will save 
us, but there&#39;s this lingering feeling of doubt in my head that I can&#39;t 
get rid of. What if we can&#39;t be saved?

Suddenly a large flash of light appeared, blinding us for a few seconds, 
and was that Belldandy I heard screaming? Footsteps grew louder and 
louder as they approached and stood outside the door. I saw the 
silhouette of three figures a short person and two taller people, oh boy 
I know who they are. The door opened with magic and my mouth dropped 
when I saw what the daimakaicho had been reduced to, a puny little 
child! Hardly threatening at all. Of course, I started to laugh, and 
then Urd slammed her hand over my mouth and told me to listen.

&quot;Hild-sama your idea is perfect! Who would have thought we can turn 
goddesses into Demons? Belldandy is proof of our efforts!&quot; exclaimed 
Mara with pride. She bewared her fangs proudly as she laughed 
triumphantly like an evil manga character...I&#39;ve been reading too many 
of Skuld&#39;s manga books.

&quot;Of course all my plans work out. But the question is should we make 
another one?&quot; she asked malevolently.

&quot;Make a demon out of Peorth and Urd? I don&#39;t think Urd would react well 
to it though&quot; we both immediately stared at each other and mentally 
screamed no in our heads.

&quot;You don&#39;t want to?&quot;

&quot;No no no I want to whatever you want Hild-sama!&quot;replied Mara hastily.

&quot;Hmm maybe not now then. I&#39;ll see what Bell-chan can do first. Then I&#39;ll 
come back&quot; said Hild.

Mara nodded and walked on with Belldandy following behind. Poor 
Belldandy, she looks so lifeless like a marionette doll, beautiful but 
lifeless. Hild stood by the door staring at our bodies with a pained 
expression. That isn&#39;t guilt I see on her face now is it? Can she even 
feel guilt?

&quot;Urd do you think she can hear or see us?&quot; I whispered out of curiosity.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Want to give it a try?&quot;

&quot;Ok you shout something out.&quot; She thought for a while then took in a 
deep breath and shouted, &quot;YOU&#39;RE AN OLD WOMAN!&quot; We both immediately 
backed into a corner from fear and held on tightly onto each other. Hild 
looked up and stared around the room, oh might Kami-sama save me! She 
then stared at where we hid in the corner with a sharp death glare.

&quot;Great Urd now we&#39;re both going to die,&quot; I whispered.

&quot;You know what I&#39;m like I need to be controlled!&quot;

&quot;This is all your...&quot;

&quot;ACHOO!&quot; sneezed Hild. She shook her head then closed the door and left. 
We both let out a sigh of relief and I practically pushed Urd off me 
when I realised we were holding onto each other.

&quot;My life flashed before me, and I&#39;ve realised I can&#39;t die without 
watching the last of my drama&quot; said Urd.

&quot;Urd focus. Did you hear what they were talking about? They made 
Belldandy into a demon!&quot;

&quot;I know, I thought it was impossible. She must have reprogrammed 
Belldandy&#39;s goddess program.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not possible. Goddesses and demons don&#39;t have the same base wave; 
you can&#39;t switch one to the other.&quot; This was a tricky puzzle. How can 
one change a goddess to a demon? Many have tried it before but it never 
works, the subject usually reverts back to their normal form. Right now, 
what do Urd and I have in common that could make us into demons? We&#39;re 
both loud, we like sake, we are outspoken and confidant and... we both 
had our angels stolen!

&quot;Urd! Our angels! We had them stolen which means we&#39;re vacant bodies for 
the taking!&quot; I yelled.

&quot;She must have put tsukaima in Belldandy... Amazing, only the 
Daimakaicho could have thought of such a thing,&quot; she said in disbelief.

&quot;Oh no they want to turn us into demons as well!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t particularly want to be one but I would look cool as a demon. I 
would pull of the uniform very well&quot; she said and started to pose. I 
face faulted and grabbed a book from a nearby shelf and threw it at her 
head. Luckily, for her though it phased through her.

----------

Time passed slowly, it seemed every passing second became a fleeting 
long moment of eternity. As Urd continued to toy with ways of how to 
join back with her body all I could do was watch and grow more worried 
by the second. I found I couldn&#39;t focus on anything she was doing no 
matter how destructive. All my mind could think of was what was going on 
outside. Are we winning? Are we losing? Is anyone hurt? Is Lind ok? I 
shook my head lightly, no, I of all people need to believe in Lind. I 
place my hand over my heart; it&#39;s the same feeling of pain I get every 
time she goes out on a mission. My heart aches and my mind won&#39;t rest 
until I see her again. Sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m a silly lovesick puppy 
or if this is genuine worry that comes with loving someone. I prefer the 
latter reason really.

&quot;Wah! Peorth what&#39;s going on?&quot; yelled Urd. I turned to look at her to 
her hand was starting to vanish.

&quot;Urd you&#39;re too far from your body! Move closer quickly&quot; she stepped 
closer but still the vanishing didn&#39;t stop. Her hand broke up into 
little balls of energy which slowly floated in the air before vanishing. 
Bit by bit she was losing herself.

&quot;You&#39;ve been in this state for too long. You don&#39;t have anymore energy 
to keep this form up&quot; I said frantically. I turned to look around the 
room searching for an energy source. Sake, a moonstone, anything will do 
I just need to find an energy source for her. Urd fell and her knees hit 
the floor with a thud, she clenched her stomach in pain and gritted her 
teeth.

&quot;I guess you were right. I should have just stayed put and not have 
flying around the room&quot; she said almost breathlessly.

&quot;Don&#39;t talk like that. Quick tell me where the nearest energy source 
is.&quot;

&quot;A moon rock is in Keichi&#39;s room.&quot;

&quot;Got it&quot;

&quot;Peorth don&#39;t go! You&#39;ll run out of energy faster than me&quot; she pleaded 
but I ignored her. Keiichi&#39;s room is down the hall to the left. I&#39;ll 
definitely run out of energy if I fly, so I guess I&#39;ll have to run.

&quot;You wait here,&quot; I said authoritatively.

&quot;No! Wait. Don&#39;t you feel it? Our angels are returning!&quot; I closed my 
eyes and searched the energy signals around me, I felt the weak signal 
of Gorgeous rose grow stronger by the second. They freed the angels! I 
watched as Urd gasp out in pain again. I can&#39;t just watch her suffer 
like this. I closed my eyes and raised my hands in front of me and 
murmured a spell. Energy drained from me and transferred to her, it 
wasn&#39;t a lot but it would be enough to sustain her until the angels 
arrive. I fell to the floor as well and started panting, but Urd wasn&#39;t 
vanishing anymore.

&quot;Baka! Do you know how dangerous an energy transfer is!&quot; she yelled.

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a thank you.&quot;

In the back of my mind I heard the faint cry of my angel calling out to 
me. Two bright powerful lights approached the room and greeted both of 
us. Gorgeous rose looked elegant as ever with her wide smiled and 
flowing hair. She reached her hand out to me and I grabbed it, and we 
united into one. Again we became a single entity, one being and one 
soul; I never want to be apart from her again.

My world went pitch black, but then I realised my eyes were closed. I 
opened them slowly to see the ceiling above me and the light glaring at 
me. I sat up quickly and looked at my hands. They were real flesh and 
blood and not transparent.

&quot;Welcome back my true self&quot; I whispered. Urd had returned as well and 
now stood proudly and ready for action.

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; she said and flew off outside through the window. I quickly 
followed behind to be greeted by the night cold air. The trees swayed 
unnaturally, as if they were following the wind current of a powerful 
force. A loud bang occurred in front of the house and Urd and I quickly 
slew there. The wind cut through my body as I flew; I now appreciate 
flying on a completely new level.

----------

The angel eater thrashed it tentacles about whilst Lind and Belldandy 
were floating in the sky above it. I felt like crying when I saw Lind 
was alive and well, my heart can relax now.

&quot;Urd! Peorth!&quot; shouted Skuld with Noble Scarlet floating behind her.

&quot;Yo, miss me?&quot; said Urd

&quot;Baka!&quot;

&quot;Nice to see you again Noble scarlet&quot; said Urd and Noble scarlet smiled 
in response.

&quot;Where&#39;s Keiichi?&quot; I asked worriedly.

&quot;He&#39;s resting behind some trees away from danger. Hosting Lind&#39;s angel 
took a lot out of him.&quot; He hosted Lind&#39;s angel? That&#39;s...intimate, 
sharing an angel is like sharing yourself with someone. Wahhhh! Keiichi 
you better not have realised the importance of what you did. Skuld was 
obviously too inexperienced to understand the meaning behind sharing an 
angel, but Urd sniggered at me. I jabbed her in the stomach with my 
elbow. She was about to retaliate when Belldandy held Lind&#39;s head to her 
chest. My eyes bulged out. What&#39;s with this couple! First Keiichi now 
Belldandy! Someone is getting whipped and tortured later, and not in the 
fun way!

&quot;Onee-sama is preparing a spell look,&quot; said Skuld who pointed excitedly 
at her sister.

Belldandy and Lind both took their spell positions and Belldandy started 
the spell off

&quot;The transient one; one who appears together with black wings. One who 
possesses violent powers and bears sharp fangs. Open the gate to your 
world&quot; She flew down and released the spell onto the angel eater. A 
large circle quickly surrounded it and the earth shook and made a trench 
around the beast. A tentacle came out to attack Belldandy but Lind flew 
in to intercept it.

&quot;Lind you concentrate on attacking. Didn&#39;t I tell you I&#39;d be alright?&quot; 
Knowing this to be our que Urd and I summoned our angels and went to aid 
Belldandy along with Skuld.

Lind stared at me and her mouth opened in astonishment. She was 
concentrating so much on the angel eater that she didn&#39;t even know I 
arrived.

&quot;Peorth...&quot; I went out and held her hand lightly with both of mine and 
stared into her golden eyes.

&quot;Let&#39;s finish this mission together,&quot; I said. We would have our reunion 
later, just holding her hand will do for now. Now we need to get rid of 
this monster. She nodded affirmatively. I turned to see Urd and Skuld 
were helping Belldandy&#39;s spell by attacking the monster. Now wanting to 
miss out on the fun either I released my great thorn vines and lashed at 
the beast.

&quot;Lind now is the time,&quot; said Belldandy.

I watched Lind attentively as she closed her eyes and summoned her other 
angel. Can she do it? Does she know the reason why she couldn&#39;t summon 
both angels in the first place? A bright light engulfed the area 
blinding everyone for a few seconds. When I opened my eyes, Lind had two 
twin angels emerging from her back. It was an amazing thing to see. This 
is what&#39;s she wanted for so long, she is now complete. Never before, 
have I seen Lind smile so happily and freely, it&#39;s really wonderful to 
see.

&quot;We finally meet cool mint and spear mint, Let&#39;s go&quot; said Lind. Let&#39;s 
go? What does she mean by that? She crouched down and concentrated her 
energy before jumping up and flew upwards the real power of a first 
class Valkyrie. Her figure became a mere dot in the distance and the 
clouds split apart as she passed through them. I couldn&#39;t see her or 
hear her but I could certainly feel the power and force she was emitting 
as she charged towards the angel eater.

&quot;She&#39;s coming,&quot; said Skuld. We all quickly jumped out of the area. 
Belldandy quickly grabbed Keiichi and flew him away.

With one well-aimed kick, Lind hit the angel eater directly on its head. 
Smoke covered the area. She&#39;s done it! It seems everyone face faulted 
when the smoke cleared and the angel eater was still there.

&quot;It really doesn&#39;t know when to give up&quot; muttered Lind in astonishment.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; I said holding out my whip. Urd and Skuld stood next to 
me holding equally threatening weapons. The angel eater seemed to gulp 
then it willingly jumped into the hole. &quot;What just happened?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your falut Urd! Your hammer is too big!&quot; shouted Skuld.

&quot;Your thorns are crazy!&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re hammer is too violent!&quot; We stopped arguing when Lind 
coughed. Embarrassed I quickly put my thorn whip away.

The sky cleared and the sun started to rise. The blue and purple of the 
night started to vanish bringing forth the orange hues of a new day. 
Belldandy and Lind repaired the house and as a first class goddess as 
well I proceeded to help out along with Skuld and Urd. Individually our 
magic is good, together, not so good. The house now looked like 
something from a manga Skuld was reading and a TV show Urd had been 
watching. Belldandy quickly rectified the problem and the house was as 
good as new. Stepping forward Lind went out to shake Keiichi&#39;s hand.

&quot;Thank you. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to let cool mint and spear mint 
meet each other without you. You were able to control Cool mint so much 
because you truly needed her power and trusted her. You&#39;re the one that 
taught me that I should have thought about letting them meet each other. 
I always thought the power I had wasn&#39;t enough and that they were one 
angel...What I needed wasn&#39;t power. I needed to truly wish for them. 
Gaining power was only a roundabout way&quot; said Lind proudly.

&quot;That isn&#39;t true. It wasn&#39;t a waste. With that power you saved us!&quot; said 
Keiichi enthusiastically.

&quot;You&#39;re right. I don&#39;t think it was a waste. All of my experiences will 
become nourishment for me. I regret nothing&quot;

&quot;Yeah&quot; said Keiichi shyly.

The gateway to heaven opened and a beam of light shone down. It seems 
Lind can&#39;t stay after all since heaven want her back so quickly. I 
sighed as she stepped up to me and held my hand, stroking it lightly. I 
looked up at her and smiled weakly

&quot;Smile, I&#39;ll come round when holiday starts,&quot; she said in her soft 
affectionate voice that she only used with me.

&quot;But that won&#39;t be for a while&quot;

&quot;You only have to wait an hour. My holiday starts today and it lasts 
until the new semester.&quot;

&quot;Today?!&quot; I blurted out.

&quot;Yes. I just need to go back to heaven and report to Senya. Can you wait 
that long?&quot; I nodded eagerly and she smiled. I love that smile. She 
kissed me on the forehead lightly and I blushed knowing four pairs of 
eager eyes were watching us. She leapt into the air and started to fly 
up

&quot;Morisato?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Can I call you a lifelong friend?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be back soon&quot; she said before flying off through the gate.

She&#39;ll be back in an hour. My inner Peorth jumped up and down screamed 
like a giddy schoolgirl. Holiday with Lind! No more annoying missions 
that will drag her away from me! This is too good to be true.

&quot;Ara it&#39;ll be breakfast time by the time Lind gets back. I&#39;ll start 
now,&quot; said Belldandy happily.

&quot;I&#39;ll help out,&quot; said Keiichi who followed behind her.

I stared up at the sky without a care in the world until Urd blurted out

&quot;Neh Skuld should we tell Lind about the time Peorth floated into a 
tree?&quot;

&quot;Or maybe we should tell Lind-san about how Peorth is rubbish at card 
games?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s tell her about the time we put wasabi in her green tea&quot;

&quot;Oh that was funny&quot; laughed skuld; I forget these sisters unite to annoy 
people. I turned around with an evil look and summoned many large thorn 
whips which turned their once laughing expressions into ones of pure 
fear. Hehehehe this going to be fun.

----------

An hour passed and exactly on time the gate opened again and a light 
shone done. My Lind descended down and touched the ground elegantly.

&quot;Holiday starts now,&quot; she said happily.

&quot;So, no missions popping up. No Mist shouting &#39;lovebirds get a room!&#39; 
and no fangirls of yours giving me evil looks?&quot;

&quot;No missions, no Mist, and no fangirls. It&#39;s just you and me.&quot;

&quot;And the extended family of course.&quot; I took her hand and we walked 
together into the house.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&quot;

----------

Omake I

Policeman arrives at the door

Keiichi: Yes, how can I help you?

Policeman: I&#39;ve had several complaints against this residence.

He takes out a note pad and reads

P: Light shows every night, loud noises and bangs, explosions, weird 
periods of glowing every now and again and a robot that attacks the 
postman. Can you explain all of this?

K: well uh...Belldandy help!!

AN:I struggled with this chapter a bit. You see Im very OCD and wanted 
to keep with the Lind Peorth pattern i have going on. So i had to think 
long and hard if i wanted to ruin my pattern or not, but i didnt phew! 
It was fun to write what happened to Peorth during the angel arc plus i 
didnt want to just repeat the anime and retell what happened to Lind. 
Hopefully I&#39;ve succeded in blending my story with the real anime.

Thank goodness the angel arc is over! no more refering to the anime or 
manga. It was hell having to keep pausing the anime to look up speach 
and timeline things! Now its over we can get back to the LindxPeorth 
fun! Their holiday starts now!

MWAHAHAHAHA depending on my mood i may create bliss or havoc for them 
but anyway STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF DESPERATE 
HOUSEWIVES...Sorry I&#39;ve been watching that too much I mean STAY TUNED 
FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF

THE GODDESS EXCHANGE PROGRAMME!
