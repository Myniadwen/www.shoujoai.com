<pre>A bright light engulfed the operation room in heaven, all eyes turned to 
the emerging figure, awaiting her return. Stepping out Lind appeared 
proudly clutching a yelling disk in her hand.

&quot;How dare you do this? I am the lord of terror! I will have rev...&quot;

&quot;Neh Lind why don&#39;t you just erase the contents?&quot; Peorth teased from 
behind her desk.

&quot;EH! You wouldn&#39;t dare!! kami sama!! Have mercy!!&quot; Shaking her head Lind 
walked over to the main admin board and opened a portal

&quot;Lind first class goddess requesting access to demon threat 0 
confinement&quot; The giant screen flickered various different coloured 
lights and turned into a whirling portal. Without another care, Lind 
threw the disk into the portal and it closed immediately. &quot;Mission 
complete&quot; She said facing Peorth, nodding in response Peorth went to 
alert Kami-sama, though he probably knew already.

&quot;YOSH! Lets all celebrate&quot; Yelled Chronos and pulled out sake from under 
her desk. Lind contently left them to their party whilst she walked off 
to another sector.

Within the training arena made of tall stone pillars and draping cloth 
was Lind practicing with her axe. Though double the woman&#39;s weight, Lind 
somehow managed to hold the axe perfectly, never being thrown off 
balance. With every thrust, slash, and stab, the movements somehow 
looked more like art than fighting. Then again, it was Lind; she 
probably had already practiced the moves thousands, no millions of times 
before. At the end of her pattern she slashed the axe downwards into the 
ground, cracking the hard slabs of stone.

&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; she yelled to the nothingness. Turning round somehow 
pulling her axe out of the ground with only one hand she positioned 
herself ready for the impending attacker.

&quot;Ara, isn&#39;t someone feisty today.&quot; From behind the draping cloth emerged 
Peorth as she walked up to her edgy comrade with two pot noodles in 
hand.

&quot;Gomen, I&#39;m a bit edgy,&quot; replied Lind as she dematerialized her axe into 
nothing.

&quot;Come on, you need to eat&quot; Peorth said and waved the pot noodle at Lind. 
Smiling slightly Lind grabbed one of the pots and the two went to their 
usual lunch spot.

Sitting in the gardens of heaven was definitely one of the most peaceful 
spots to have lunch. Slurping on this newly discovered treat which 
Peorth discovered on earth the two were content. Glancing at her hungry 
friend Peorth wondered how their friendship had started, after all at 
times they were complete opposites.

It was probably back then, a long time ago when Peorth and Lind were 
still third class goddess&#39;s. As part of a goddess&#39;s training, they need 
to have an experience in all fields, the goddess relief agency, Admin 
operations, special duties, Demon control, and earth maintenance. It was 
in the final stages of their training where they met, Peorth was to join 
the special duties service where she would be under the guidance of new 
cadet Lind. Even back then Lind was powerful and almost unapproachable.

&quot;Third-class, restricted goddess Peorth, reporting for exchange training 
in special duty services.&quot;

&quot;Third-class special duties goddess Lind, I will be in charge of your 
training. Follow Me,&quot; said Lind stoically. Both disappearing through a 
portal, they arrived on earth. It wasn&#39;t an easy first mission, in 
reality a second-class goddess would be taking care of Peorth&#39;s 
training, but this was Lind. Her superior had much faith in the blue 
haired girl so gave her the task of Peorth. Both flying silently towards 
the area mostly because Lind didn&#39;t talk and Peorth was too in awe of 
the Valkyrie. Stopping abruptly Lind finally talked to Peorth

&quot;A human was recently granted a wish by the demon relief agency and is 
misusing his given powers and terrorizing a local village. Our job is to 
eradicate all summoned creatures and strip the human of his powers. 
Understood?&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot; saluted Peorth, trying to look somewhat professional

&quot;There is no need for you to salute. Besides from your reputation it&#39;s 
hard to believe that you do so for anyone that isn&#39;t your beloved 
onee-sama.&quot; Said Lind, her shimmering blue hair flowing with the gentle 
breezes of the wind.

&quot;I have a reputation?&quot; Asked Peorth, raising her left eyebrow

&quot;The Vain Rose.&quot;

&quot;What? In all of heaven that&#39;s what I&#39;m known as?&quot; A small smile formed 
on Lind&#39;s face as she floated over to the screaming woman

&quot;I&#39;m joking.&quot; Suddenly a loud explosion was heard beneath them &quot;Let&#39;s 
go!&quot; Yelled Lind. Flying at top speed Peorth almost found it difficult 
to keep up with the Valkyrie, but somehow she managed. They arrived in a 
large forest and landed to explore the area.

&quot;There&#39;s the village&quot; said Peorth and pointed towards the edge of the 
forest. They were only several meter&#39;s away from the village entrance, 
&quot;We have to keep a low profile.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; The two goddesses looked around them only noticing trees and 
the faint sound of insects. It seemed perfectly normal, but they both 
knew better. There was a disturbance in the air, some aura, not 
completely demonic, but something. Summoning her axe in her hands, Lind 
was going to warn Peorth only to see she too had summoned her whip. With 
both of their backs pressed together, the two prepared for whatever was 
coming. They couldn&#39;t see or hear anything, but something was circling 
them getting ready to pounce.

Suddenly it appeared. A monster resembling Fenrir slightly but with 
horns and wings protruding from its body leapt out from the bushes.

&quot;It comes!&quot; Yelled Lind. The two flew off into different directions as 
the monster slammed into the ground where they were standing. It roared 
so loudly the ground shook and leaves fell from the trees. From its 
mouth it conjured up dangerous flames spat fireballs at the goddesses. 
Lind dodged it swiftly and readied her battle-axe; she flew full speed 
at the monster passing Peorth in a blur

&quot;Summon a Level three portal! I can&#39;t kill it with a village so close!&quot; 
She yelled only to see Peorth was a few steps ahead of her and was 
already opening the portal. Deep in concentration muttering the 
incantations, large magic symbols and circles appeared. The symbols lit 
up and glowed and the earth crumbled in the centre revealing a portal to 
Nifleheim. If not for the magic circle and symbols the sheer aura of the 
portal would destroy all life nearby.

&quot;A level three wont do! This monster requires a level five; I can only 
keep it open for three minutes though!&quot; Yelled Peorth, Lind had neared 
the monster and swung her axe into its body with full force

&quot;I only need two!&quot; The monster was struck back into the edge of the 
magic area, and Lind chased after it. She raised her axe high and struck 
down again, but it managed to evade her slightly getting its shoulder 
slashed, but it was immobilized for the moment. Lind raised her axe 
again to strike, but the monster extended its neck and caught the handle 
of the axe into its jaws. They both pushed and pulled as each tried to 
push the other into the portal. The monster&#39;s mouth glowed a bright red 
as it summoning another fireball. Quickly Lind let go of the axe and the 
monster flicked its head back, summoning her energy, Lind punched it, 
hard. It yelled in agony and landed exactly over the portal, before it 
knew what was happening the monster was sucked up and disappeared. 
Nearby the other goddess landed and leant against a tree, she wasn&#39;t use 
to keeping portals open for so long, it had tired her greatly.

&quot;That was three minutes. Your getting slow&quot; she joked. Summoning her 
axe, Lind walked over confidently to a tree and cut it down with one 
slash. The tree collapsed slowly and once the dust cleared a quivering 
man was found trembling at the sight of the goddess. It only took so 
much as a glare from Lind before the man knelt and begged for mercy.

&quot;Don&#39;t kill me, don&#39;t kill me! I didn&#39;t know it was dangerous.&quot;

&quot;You knew full well the implications of your wish yet you wanted the 
creature anyway! You have attacked and plundered villages throughout 
this region! You shall not be forgiven!&quot; Lind raised her axe and slashed 
at the man.

&quot;NOOO!&quot; He yelled and knelt into a ball.

&quot;Lind!&quot; screamed Peorth. It was only when the man realised he could 
still hear his heart beating wildly that he realised he was alive. 
Seeing that Lind had only destroyed the summoning crystal the man was 
holding, Peorth let out a sigh of relief. Lind wouldn&#39;t kill anyone. 
Closing her eyes Peorth fell back; only to be held up by strong-arms 
holding her up by the waist. She opened her eyes to see Lind was flying 
them both to their arrival portal to go back up to heaven. Closing her 
eyes once more to the image of Lind flying proudly, Peorth could help 
but think what an amazing person the Valkyrie was.

She was snapped out of her thoughts when Lind stole her pot noodles and 
started eating them.

&quot;Hey! I gave you one already.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s finished&quot; Lind replied slurping hastily

&quot;Fine, I&#39;m watching my diet anyway.&quot; She watched the woman eat happily 
and a smile formed on her face knowing that Lind only ate with Peorth. 
It seemed no one else but her could get the Valkyrie to stop practicing 
in her quest to get stronger. Yet there she was slurping noodles 
happily, getting addicted to msg. Glancing at the woman once more Peorth 
noticed there was a cut on the valkyrie&#39;s neck. Without thinking, the 
rose obsessed woman edged closed and placed her hand on her companion&#39;s 
neck.

&quot;I&#39;m not giving back the noodles,&quot; said Lind defensively.

&quot;I don&#39;t want the noodles.&quot; Replied Peorth, than her hand glowed a 
bright light, and Lind felt her neck warm to the touch. She couldn&#39;t 
help but close her eyes; it was such a nice feeling, so warm, so loving. 
The woman removed her hand once the cut was healed and used one finger 
to stroke up Lind&#39;s neck teasingly, knowing that she was ticklish.

&quot;HEY, no tickling!&quot; snapped Lind knowing what Peorth was up to.

&quot;Honestly is that how you treat your healer?&quot;

&quot;I could have done it myself, but your effort is appreciated.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a thank you,&quot; said Peorth as she leant back on a tree 
behind them, watching the leaves flow in the wind. Finishing her food 
with one final gulp, Lind fell backwards onto the grass and stretched 
out.

&quot;Peorth?&quot; The woman looked down at her lazy companion &quot;Thanks.&quot; They 
both smiled, real smiles, and embraced the comfortable silence.
