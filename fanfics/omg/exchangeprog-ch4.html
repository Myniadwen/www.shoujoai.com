Ah... What a nice dream, I dreamt Lind kissed me, it was amazing. We 
were in a field of flowers with a house behind us, probably our house, I 
blush at the thought. She was leaning on a tree, calling me with her 
blue eyes. I trailed through the long grass which reached past my knee 
and when I was close enough she pulled me into a wonderfully sweet kiss.

But I know that&#39;s all it will ever be, a dream. In reality I don&#39;t think 
the valkyrie even understands love, let alone with me. I&#39;ve accepted 
that this is all I will have of Lind, just random dreams whilst I sleep 
and as a friend when I wake. This unrequited love burns deep in my soul, 
like my love for my roses I just get rid of it. I&#39;ve always thought 
about what would happen if I told Lind I loved her, would she retreat 
from me, keep me at a distance? Would she gently let me down? I really 
don&#39;t know, the only things she really loves are the treats I bring back 
from earth, and her axe.

It&#39;s hard to believe that Lind actually has a crush on someone. Who? I 
wonder.

When she told me about it, I could actually feel my heart breaking into 
a thousand pieces. I tried to conceal my pain by looking away; I 
couldn&#39;t bear to stare into her eyes as she told me she was in love with 
someone other than me. Lind doesn&#39;t love me, I knew that but, there was 
this lingering hope within me that maybe one day she could learn to love 
me. There was this hope that one day I would gather the courage to tell 
her how I felt. All hope is lost now. Even as a friend I want Lind to be 
mine for as long as possible. Who is this person though? I want to know, 
no, I need to know.

Of course it&#39;s all for Lind&#39;s benefit of course.

Hoho! The sooner I find out who it is she likes, the sooner I can scare 
them away....I mean test them, to see if they are worthy enough of Lind. 
They shall endure my wrath! HOHOHOHOHO

&quot;Um, Peorth-san?&quot; I snapped out my thoughts and realised I was spinning 
around maniacally on my chair with my feet up. I quickly stomped my foot 
down to stop spinning only to see the entire Operations team staring at 
me with their mouths wide open.

&quot;Yes, Est-san?&quot; I asked trying to sound as calm as possible.

&quot;Ano, you were laughing very loudly&quot; she said worriedly.

Oh Kami, I thought I was laughing in my head, obviously not. I cleared 
my throat and sat down on the chair properly like a lady of my stature 
should, and placed my hands on the arm rests.

&quot;EVEYRONE GET BACK TO WORK!&quot; I shouted. Most of the team had a heart 
attack from the sudden shock of me shouting. Those that hadn&#39;t fainted 
immediately lowered their heads and returned to their work without 
asking a single question. My inner Peorth laughed confidently at how 
well I had handled the situation, crisis averted.

I extended the keyboard attached onto my chair and placed it in front of 
me. Opening up a data screen I entered in my Admin password and was 
granted access into the Goddess files. I love being in charge. The 
goddess files contained the profiles of every registered Goddess and God 
for the last two millennia, the person Lind likes is in this list 
definitely.

Who does Lind normally spend her time with? Obviously me, I made sure of 
that, but whom else? Someone on Valkyrie squad 1? I snapped my fingers 
and quickly scrolled down the list to my first candidate&#39;s profile. 
Quickly scrolling through down to the Valkyrie section I started my 
search. To everyone else I was simply doing routine work which was 
assigning Valkyrie&#39;s their duties, but little did they know my evil 
plan. HOHOHO...I quickly calmed myself before I started laughing out 
loud again.

A separate smaller screen opened up and displayed a large picture and a 
biography. The picture showed Mist in one of her fighting stances with 
her axe, her green aura prominent around her body. Could it be Mist? I 
glanced through her profile information and read gaining all the more 
knowledge about my competitor. Mist currently was classified as 
&quot;available&quot; meaning she was still in heaven, probably teaching. Good, I 
can go do some reconnaissance and see if she really is the one. I mean 
she has to be the one Lind has a crush on; Lind doesn&#39;t spend her time 
with anyone else. I slammed my right hand into my left palm. I had it! 
Even if Lind didn&#39;t love me, I shouldn&#39;t neglect my duties as a goddess 
of love. I would pair her and Mist up, at least I would gain some 
comfort in knowing that I played some part in her happiness.

My trail of thought was ruined when the earth portal glowed brightly 
engulfing the area with a light blue glow. First a foot emerged from the 
portal and soon the entire being of a goddess was revealed, only one 
person other than me dared to dress like that in heaven, Urd. I was 
expecting her earlier; she was precisely 8 hours 27 minutes and 19 
seconds late. She was here to input her research data about earth&#39;s 
status, though I doubt she did any, she usually made up the figures.

&quot;Yo, Peorth!&quot; she yelled from across the room. She quickly flew up 
towards me on the upper level and landed in front of me, floating in a 
fake sitting position.

&quot;You&#39;re late&quot; I sighed.

&quot;Not really, you said be here at five on the third day of Gemini, and it 
is the third day of Gemini on earth.&quot; She said and stuck her tongue out 
at me.

&quot;Whatever&quot; I stood up from my seat and motioned for her to sit which she 
happily did. &quot;Just input the earth data and be on your way&quot;

&quot;On my way?&quot; She asked

&quot;Yes, on your way. Back to earth as usual.&quot;

&quot;Ara, it seems you&#39;ve forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Forgotten what?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in charge from now on.&quot; She started laughing to herself at my 
expense, damn it her and her mind games. She flicked her white hair 
behind her confidently and crossed her legs, she was getting comfortable 
in my chair! How dare she.

&quot;What are you talking about? I&#39;m in charge. You are here to input data. 
D-A-T-A&quot; I said and slammed my hand down on the chair&#39;s armrest.

&quot;Check again&quot; She winked at me and laughed again &quot;What&#39;s the date 
today?&quot;

&quot;The third day of Gemini in the tenth month of...&quot; I finally realised 
what she was talking about, my mouth dropped open and I froze. How could 
I forget such an important date?

&quot;It&#39;s the changing of the guard, neh? Hahahah! I can&#39;t believe you 
forgot.&quot; She continued laughing for a good while until she got bored and 
started drawing on my face with an ink spell. I was still frozen in 
place, gripping onto the chair. Soon Urd even grew bored of drawing on 
my face and actually left me there to do some of her work.

I was demoted. Technically not demoted more like given a holiday, Urd 
was going to take over Earth operations, whilst I....did nothing. 
Wahhhh! My chair! My files! My different colour paper clips! All Urd&#39;s 
now. Every few weeks there is a &quot;changing of the guards&quot; as Urd puts it. 
Four goddesses take it in turns to be in charge of operations, now it 
was Urd&#39;s turn. I don&#39;t want to leave my post! I&#39;ll be so...carefree.

Matte, is that a bad thing? No more paper work, no more typing, no more 
destruction of the earth to deal with! I loosened my grip on the chair 
and a wide smile appeared on my face, yes finally I would have time to 
plan my master plan of pairing up Mist and Lind. Then finally everything 
from the last ten minutes flooded into my brain. Full of anger I grabbed 
Urd and spun her around to face me

&quot;GET THIS OFF MY FACE!&quot;

After much yelling and a few friendly attack spells Urd finally removed 
the ink from my face.

I quickly flew off towards the Valkrie&#39;s domain, the Battle centre. A 
section within heaven completely dedicated to teachings of a goddesses 
fundamental knowledge. The higher up valkyries always used the 
facilities or taught students in their free time, Mist has to be there. 
The sooner I get there the sooner I can pair them up! I shall be the 
best love goddess ever known! HOHOHOHOHO Just you wait you two. Lind if 
this is all I can do for you then so be it. You shall be with Mist, I 
Love, beauty and elegance goddess Peorth swear it.
