<h2>Beginnings End</h2>
<p>Doctor Tofu looked Zhu Shu over critically. “Well,  well, you’ve certainly managed to pull these muscles good.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded  glumly. “Zhu Shu not do kata this day. Wish could have avoided. Not have  choice.” She winced as Tofu straightened her neck, then sighed in relief. <p>
  Tofu nodded. “You  should be ok. That tea will help you restore your ki, and this salve will help  those strained muscles. But just what style do you fight that would pull <em>those</em> muscles?”<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed.  “Not all pulled in fight. Zhu Shu try show off how flexible is. Not good idea  after fight.”<p>
  Ranma moved over  and dropped his bag down almost on top of the photo. “What happened? Did  someone pick a fight with you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him  a sidelong glance. “Ranma could say that.” A faint hint of sadness tinted her  voice.<p>
  “Must have been  a tough fight to bang you up like this.”<p>
  “They not lay  hands on. Zhu Shu very fast. Not warmed up though. Overextend self.” Zhu Shu  shrugged. Ranma was too distracted to notice the haunted look in her eyes. <p>
  “They? Were you  ganged up on?”<p>
  She nodded. “Deal  with three before chi gone.”<p>
  “Three? I hope  you taught them a lesson.”<p>
  Shadows covered  Zhu Shu’s eyes and she looked away before answering. “They learn lesson. Never  bother again.”<p>
  Ranma nodded,  his eyes darting to the photo. Zhu Shu noticed the furtive look and her eyes  narrowed. He was up to something.<p>
  Doctor Tofu  finished rubbing the salve into Zhu Shu’s lower back, then proceeded to put her  spine back in place as Ranma bent down to pick up his bag...<p>
  And a photo he  was rather covert about picking up. Zhu Shu made a note to ask him about it  later.<p>
  He quickly  palmed it as Doctor Tofu finished with her back. “There you go. All your bones  are back where they should be! You should be more careful though.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded  as she stood, the examination gown she was wearing billowing slightly. She held  the back closed with one hand as she stretched and bowed without pain. “Thank  you.”<p>
  Ranma, too busy  looking over his shoulder to make sure no one had seen him pick up the photo,  put his foot down on the soapy brush Tofu had been cleaning the floor with when  Zhu Shu had arrived. His footing went out from under him and he landed on the  bucket by the brush. Soapy water splashed as books and photo went flying.<p>
  Akane dived for  the photo, and snagged it, but as her foot came down into the soapy water, she  skidded. She slid headlong into Zhu Shu, knocking them both down as the photo  fluttered into the air again.<p>
  “Hmm? What’s  this?” Doctor Tofu asked as his fingers closed on it. He reached to adjust his  glasses to look at it...<p>
  The door slid  open as Kasumi looked in. “Hello Doctor. Is Zhu Shu okay now?”<p>
  The photo  dropped unlooked-at from nerveless fingers, as the Doctors glasses steamed  instantly. Nabiki snatched it from midair as the Doctor stuttered, “K-K-Kasumi?  Imagine meeting you here of all places!”<p>
  Kasumi laughed. “But  Doctor, this is your office.”<p>
  “Oh yes! Imagine  that!”<p>
  Kasumi looked  around the room and uttered a single “Oh, my!”<p>
  Ranma was on her  knees, her white top soaked to near transparency. Zhu Shu was lying on the  floor, her examination gown up around her shoulders. Akane was straddling her,  not noticing her hand was firmly planted on Zhu Shu’s right breast. Nabiki was  holding the photo, looking at Kasumi with a pale and wide-eyed expression on  her face. <p>
  Silence held for  a long second before Doctor Tofu held up his skeleton. “W-well Kasumi! As you  can see, Zhu Shu is back to perfect health!”<p>
  Kasumi looked to  the Mandarin girl, who had a quixotically amused expression, and smiled. “Why,  yes. I can see that.” She beamed at Akane. “I’m so glad to see you all getting  along so well.”<p>
  Zhu Shu giggled.<p>
  Akane looked  down and noticed where her hand was. “I... uh... I tripped!”<p>
  Zhu Shu giggled  harder. “Not mind. Maybe Akane trip like this more often.”<p>
  Akane blushed  all the way down to her shoes. She quickly got up and straightened her school  dress, too embarrassed to say anything. Zhu Shu continued to giggle as she drew  her gown down.<p>
  “Yes!” Doctor  Tofu said. “Akane and Zhu Shu were becoming great friends!” He addressed the  skeleton again. “Weren’t you, Zhu Shu?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu over  here!” The Chinese girl called from her seat on the floor, still giggling.<p>
  “Ah yes!” He  scurried over to Ranma. “Oh! <em>Ahem</em>...  It seems I’ve developed X-ray vision!”<p>
  “That Ranma!”  Zhu Shu laughed. She looked to where Kasumi was hiding a smile.<p>
  Tofu double  blinked. “Oh. My. Ranma? I’m afraid I’m completely out of my depth here. You’ll  need to see a psychologist about this transvestite problem...”<p>
  Ranma rolled his  eyes. “Gee... Thanks...”<p>
  Kasumi finally  herded Tofu away long enough to allow Zhu Shu to go and get changed and Ranma,  Akane and Nabiki to escape outside. As they left the clinic, Akane turned to a  visibly relaxing Nabiki and demanded, “Okay! Now what was so important about  that photo?”<p>
  Nabiki showed  her. <p>
  All Akane  managed was a strangled “Urk!” as extreme shock set in. Ranma’s jaw dropped.<p>
  “Oh my! Someone  took a picture?” Kasumi plucked it out of Nabiki’s hand. “How wonderful! I must  get this framed for Zhu Shu. It will make a wonderful apology for causing her  to pull those muscles this afternoon!”<p>
  Nabiki blinked  as Akane and Ranma stared wide-eyed.<p>
  “I suppose I  should have known better, exhausted as the poor dear was, but I thought she  would enjoy it, and I did want to thank her for saving me from those thugs...  This will make such a lovely memento!” She smiled as she turned back towards  the Dojo, humming happily.<p>
  Staring after  her, Akane murmured, “She... she... Kasumi?!”<p>
  Ranma turned as  Zhu Shu came out of the clinic, back in her usual dress. “Zhu Shu?”<p>
  “Yes,  Ranma-chan?”<p>
  “Y-y-y-you and  Kasumi...?”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised  and eyebrow, then smiled her ‘mouse who got the cheese’ smile. “Why Ranma want  know? Not Zhu Shu place tell.” She sauntered past the trio, and right before  she turned the corner, she threw a look back over her shoulder. “All Zhu Shu  say, shiatsu can be wonderful thing.” She cocked her hip jauntily as she swung  her hair back over her shoulder, then vanished.<p>
  Still frozen in  the pose she had been in when Kasumi took the photo, Nabiki fainted again...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Dinner at the  Tendo house that night was a little quiet. Zhu Shu sat quietly, eating little.  Akane and Nabiki gave sidelong glances at both Zhu Shu and Kasumi. Ranma  watched all of them, but finally started watching Zhu Shu most of all. Despite  her flippant attitude earlier, something was wrong. She was barely touching her  meal and was avoiding looking at anyone directly.<p>
  Kasumi merrily  told about the day she and Zhu Shu had spent, telling her family about meeting  Rei, and their visit to Chinatown. She  described the fight as an attempted mugging, but the way she watched Zhu Shu  carefully while telling about it made Ranma think there was more to it than  either one was saying. By the end of dinner, Nabiki and even Akane had noticed  too. They looked at Kasumi questioningly, but got a shake of the head for their  reply.<p>
  After dinner,  Zhu Shu went out to the garden. She sat under the tree by the bank of the koi  pond and assumed a meditation pose. After a few minutes, Ranma came and sat  beside her. Several minutes passed before he spoke. “I ain’t real good at this,  Zhu Shu, but even I can see there’s something you’re not saying.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sat  motionless for a long moment as Ranma’s eyes searched the shadows that hid her  eyes. Finally, Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  Another long  moment passed before Ranma spoke again. “Something about the fight.”<p>
  Again, Zhu Shu  nodded. A single tear escaped her closed eyes and rolled down her cheek. A  slight tremor was all the sign she gave that inside she was screaming.<p>
  For once, Ranma  saw it. The single tear glimmered in the darkness. At a loss, he struggled to  think about what could bother the unshakable Chinese girl, and when the answer  came he felt himself grow both as cold as a block of ice and a hot as the sun  in rage. His hands curled into fists momentarily as all he wanted to do was  demolish whoever had caused Zhu Shu this pain.<p>
  Then a second  tear fell beside the first and the rage fled before concern for his friend. For  long seconds he stood at a loss, unsure how to comfort her, and then some  instinct told him what she would respond to.<p>
  He moved and  there was the sound of a hand dipping in water, then the wet-haired girl  gathered Zhu Shu in her arms. “You had to kill someone, didn’t you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded  again as more tears fell, but she refused to break. She had been trained to  deal with this! She was a bodyguard as well as a servant! It was a duty like  any other!<p>
  But the images  of death had refused to leave her mind. For all her fights, she had never had  to kill. Memories of the shock that ran along her arm as she cut into the  assassins, of the hot bloody spray that followed the path of her blade... they  haunted her. Kasumi had tried to help, had tried to distract her by getting her  to demonstrate a few dances, but the pulled muscles she had developed had only  served to remind her of why she had them. <p>
  And she damned  herself for feeling this way. She had been trained to kill in defense without  remorse.<p>
  But inside she  was still crying...<p>
  Ranma wasn’t  done turning the tables yet. She held the Mandarin girl to her and spoke. “I  know you’ve been trained all you life to care for others, Zhu-chan, but what  about you? Can’t someone care for you?” She pulled Zhu Shu tighter. “You don’t  have to be steel all the time. You don’t have to hide from me. I know I can be  a jerk, and an idiot, but a very wise person once told me everyone needs  someone for whom there are no masks.” Zhu Shu shook slightly as Ranma quoted  her from one of their fireside talks in China. “You can see beyond my masks  better than I can, but what of you? Why can’t I be the person you allow behind  your masks. The one who is allowed to see the girl instead of the sword?” <p>
  Zhu Shu sobbed  silently, her hands clenched but she still fought the tears. Ranma felt her  throat tighten as she tried to think of ways to help her. Desperately hoping  something would work, she just started talking.<p>
  “Look, you know  I’m no good at this kinda stuff. I mean, I know I can be an idiot, and well,  this bit about you being attracted to girls kinda threw me, but it doesn’t  matter to me anymore. You’re my friend, and I ain’t got so many of those. I  gotta care for the ones I have, right?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  at Ranma, her eyes brimming. She stared into the redhead’s eyes and  understanding dawned. “She send you, yes no?” she whispered.<p>
  “Kasumi? Yes.  She stopped me after dinner and sent me after you. She said sometimes people  need a friend instead of a sister.” She reached out to pull Zhu Shu’s head  against her again. “I want to be that friend, Zhu Shu. I think I’m only just  starting to see how much of a friend you are to me, but you need a friend like  you too. I dunno if I can be that good a friend, but I want to try.” <p>
  The weight of  secrets tore her heart. She tried to pull away, guilt at what she had hidden  driving her to run, but Ranma wouldn’t let her go. “You not even really know  Zhu Shu,” she protested weakly.<p>
  “Your mysteries  don’t matter to me, Zhu Shu. I know enough to treasure you as my best friend.”<p>
  “My mysteries  can kill Ranma!” Zhu Shu sobbed.<p>
  “I don’t care!  Zhu Shu, you’re my friend. That’s all that matters!” Ranma raised Zhu Shu’s  face to look into her eyes. “You’re my friend. You want to see me happy, I want  to see you happy.”<p>
  She wanted to  tell her. She wanted to let her know about Shan Pu, about her quest, her plans,  but as she opened her mouth to tell her everything, Ranma place a finger on her  lips. “Don’t speak. Don’t be Zhu Shu the Sword. Don’t be the Imperial Servant.  Just be Zhu Shu - my friend, and a girl who had to do something more dreadful  than she should ever have had to do to save the life of a friend.”<p>
  She stared into  Ranma’s eyes and saw only concern. Within her, the iron wall broke, and for the  first time since the loss of Ying-Ying, she gave in to the tears…<p>
  Ranma held her  throughout the crying fit, and listened as Zhu Shu told her about the fight.  Zhu Shu had to admit that this was not the first time she had had to fight  these thugs, and that there was someone in China that had sent them, but that  she didn’t know for sure if the attackers had been sent by the same person, or  who that person was, or even if any others would come. All she had known was  that someone in a dark cloak had asked if she was Clan Dragon, then demanded  her swords. When she refused, she had been attacked. Like last time, they had  tried to capture her, and if they had not tried to kill Kasumi, she could have  defeated them again without killing. Ranma nodded.<p>
  “I would have  done the same, Zhu Shu. A challenge is one thing, but they were trying  cold-blooded murder. Why didn’t you ever tell me this?” he asked<p>
  “Zhu Shu not  think be danger outside Peking. Not attacked  by them since. But think they tong. Zhu Shu learn not tell people her clan. Not  want people think she tong.” She brought her knees up and curled her arms  around them. “Thought had escaped danger when leave cities in China. Did not  think would follow to Japan.  Did not think would be danger to friends,” she finished sadly.<p>
  “You’re not Zhu  Shu. There’s no way they would have known where you were if you had stayed out  of Chinatown. And you’re not alone here. I’ll  protect you, too.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded  sadly. “Thank you.”<p>
  Ranma rose. “Will  you be alright now?”<p>
  She assayed a  weak smile. “Is okay. Ranma help.”<p>
  The redhead  nodded. “If you need anything...”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Just  one thing,” she said as she stood, wiping her eyes and giving Ranma a haunted  look.<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  “Try, once,  listen Akane same way.” She smoothed the hem of her skirt. “Zhu Shu want Ranma  and Akane be happy, but not much time be alone as couple.” She disappeared  before her heart betrayed too much, leaving a wide-eyed and very puzzled Ranma  looking at the vacancy she had left behind.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“So why did you  send <em>him</em> to talk to her?” Akane  asked, looking up from her cup of hot chocolate.<p>
  Kasumi finished  up with her preparations for breakfast as she answered. “Because she’s his best  friend. He knows her better than anyone.”<p>
  “But he’s  hopeless! He can’t seem to ever say the right thing!” Akane protested. “He’ll  make a mess of it!”<p>
  “I don’t think  so. He has a good heart, Akane. He may not be all that great at showing it, but  I think that might have to do with the fact that he’s your fiancé.”<p>
  “What would that  have to do with anything?” Akane grumped. “He treats her way better than he  does me!”<p>
  “I think you  make him nervous, Akane.” Kasumi washed her hands and sat down for a cup of  tea. “He’s just more relaxed around her, is all. She’s his friend. You are much  more, at least potentially.”<p>
  “That’s a  wonderful reason to insult me all the time.”<p>
  Kasumi shook her  head. “You intimidate him, Akane. I think you’d be surprised at what he might  be like if he didn’t think he had to prove anything to you.”<p>
  “I don’t want  him to prove anything to me! Except maybe that he’s not a jerk!”<p>
  “Have you told <em>him</em> that?”<p>
  Akane looked at  Kasumi oddly. “Well, no.”<p>
  Kasumi rose and  placed her teacup by the sink to wash up in the morning. She stopped at the  door just before exiting and looked at Akane. “Maybe you should.”<p>
  She turned and  left just as Ranma entered, his shirt still damp from comforting Zhu Shu. He  saw the hot chocolate Akane was drinking and asked, “Is there any more of that?”<p>
  Akane nodded to  a kettle on the stove. “Help yourself.”<p>
  Ranma did so,  and settled into the chair opposite of Akane, a subdued expression on his face.<p>
  “What’s wrong  with Zhu Shu?” she asked.<p>
  Ranma stared  into his cup for a long time before answering. “She... She’ll be okay.”<p>
  Akane glared. “That’s  not what I asked.”<p>
  Ranma looked up.  “I’m not sure I should tell you. I don’t know if she wants you to know.”<p>
  “Oh. I see how  it is. I’m not enough of a friend.” Akane crossed her arms and slumped  sullenly.<p>
  “That’s not-“  Ranma started, then shook his head. “Think what you want,” he said disgustedly.  “You’re only looking for an excuse to fight anyway.”<p>
  “I am not! Just  because you and her have your little secrets means nothing to me!”<p>
  “Why do you have  to be angry all the time?” Ranma asked. “She’s my friend and I just went to  comfort her because I saw she wasn’t feeling happy. I don’t want to fight!”<p>
  “Oh. So you care  more about her feelings than you do mine! Some fiancé <em>you</em> are.”<p>
  “Yes, I care  about her feelings!” Ranma growled, leaning over the table. “She had to kill  three people today to save <em>your</em> sisters life! And she’s feeling bad about it! I think that’s a <em>little</em> more important than your fit of  jealousy!”<p>
  Akane stared in  shock. “What?” she whispered.<p>
  Ranma sat back  down, his fury suddenly spent. “She had to kill those muggers. They were trying  to shoot Kasumi. She had no time to take it easy on them. As it was, she barely  got to the gunman in time.”<p>
  Akane was  speechless.<p>
  “That’s why  Kasumi kissed her on the train. To thank her. For saving her life. I dunno if  they did anything else, but in retrospect, I just don’t care, except to hope  that if they did, they both enjoyed it. I feel like a complete jerk for  reacting the way I did at the doctor’s office. So Zhu Shu likes girls. Big  deal. She’s my friend, and I care about her. Nothing else matters...” He hung  his head between his hands. “And all she wants is for <em>us</em> to be happy with one another. After all the crying and the  tears, her last words to me before going to bed were to ask me to listen to you  the way I listened to her. That’s why I came in here.”<p>
  Akane looked  down into her cup. “I-I’m sorry.”<p>
  Ranma shrugged. “What  does it matter? Whatever I do, it makes you angry.” <p>
  Akane looked up,  stung, and glared. “That’s because you go out of your way to aggravate me!”<p>
  Ranma looked at  her for a second, then lowered his eyes and stood to leave. As he passed  through the door, he stopped and looked back at Akane. “Nabiki fainted because  I asked her where you’d have fun on a date. Now I don’t know why I bothered.”<p>
  Akane sat and  looked out the door after him for a long, long time...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Back in her  room, Zhu Shu shut the door and leaned back against it. She hoped she had not  said too much, but she had lost control of her emotions. Her feelings were a  storm of chaos inside her that raged unchecked, but quixotically, for all the  pain and despair, she felt more alive than she had in years. She didn’t want to  analyze the feelings, to sort them and categorize them and tuck them back in  their niches, not now. They were still too raw for that. Tonight she simply  wanted to forget...<p>
  She drew a deep  breath. Kasumi’s scent was still heavy in the air, a light floral fragrance  that reminded her of spring. She’d been in the room recently. She looked around  the room, her eyes finding a small silver frame placed artfully so a beam of  light from the street outside illuminated it. She stripped out of her dress and  panties, folding them by the door, and moved over to the bed to look at it.<p>
  The photographer  had gotten the best possible angle, showing the kiss Kasumi had given her on  the train. A light outside the train window had been passing as the shot was  snapped, and a trick of the light made it look like a halo...<p>
  She lay down on  the bed and let the happiness of that memory drown out the sadness, her eyes  locked on the photo until they just couldn’t stay open.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On a rooftop  several houses away, a black figure had observed Zhu Shu’s preparations for  bed. As she drifted off to sleep, the figure made its way around the dojo,  occasionally crouching on all fours as it seemed to sniff the ground. After  several circuits, it seemed satisfied and slinked away into the shadows to  report.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Friday dawned  bright and clear over Nerima. Kasumi hummed happily at her work as she prepared  breakfast. Nabiki sat and laid odds on who would go into the koi pond first. As  Ranma once more landed in the pond, Akane came down to breakfast. Kasumi  brought out several trays as Ranma wrung out her shirt, studiously ignoring  Akane. Akane looked at Ranma with a strangely subdued expression as she sat  down at the table, for once not commenting on his toplessness. Nabiki watched  both of them curiously.<p>
  As Kasumi  brought out the last of the breakfast dishes, Zhu Shu came down as well. She  was smiling her usual smile, and only a small hint of sadness behind her eyes  betrayed the last traces of yesterday’s stresses. Akane watched her wide-eyed  as she came and sat down. Zhu Shu’s gaze flickered between Akane and Ranma, and  a small sigh escaped her lips.<p>
  Kasumi noted all  of this and tried to ease the tensions by starting a conversation. “Did you  sleep well last night, Zhu Shu?”<p>
  A real smile  came into Zhu Shu’s eyes as she turned to Kasumi. “Yes, Kasumi-san. Zhu Shu  sleep well. Have pleasant dreams.” The sparkle in her eyes left little doubt  what those dreams had been about. Kasumi blushed slightly.<p>
  Nabiki looked  up, a calculating look in her eye as she glanced between Ranma and Akane, still  studiously avoiding looking at each other. “Zhu Shu, I was wondering when you  would be starting school. You and I can go together. Do you need your  transcripts sent from China?”<p>
  Zhu Shu  considered. Grandfather would need a reason for why she would need to go to a  Japanese school, and an explanation for why she was in Japan. But it  would make guiding Ranma and Akane to a happy relationship easier. She weighed  the advantages and disadvantages, then decided it was worth it. “Yes. Zhu Shu  will need send to home village.”<p>
  Nabiki smiled. “Wonderful.  Now I’ll have someone to walk to school with again. If you will write the  message, I’ll take you to where you can send it.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded,  noting Kasumi’s happy smile. Akane and Ranma both looked surprised, but happy  about it as well. Soun just beamed and cried at how happy he was that his new “Adopted  Daughter” would be starting school.<p>
  So Friday began.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu spent  several hours composing her letter to her grandfather while Akane and Ranma  were in school, then helped Kasumi clean house until they got a visit from a  well-to-do reporter by the name of Tsukino, who spent several hours looking  over the dojo and talking to Soun before deciding that it was okay for his  daughter and her friends to attend martial arts classes. Why his little Usagi  wanted to learn martial arts was beyond him, but he approved of the idea of her  getting some discipline. Soun wept for joy again when the man handed him the  check for the girl’s entire first year... <p>
  Following  school, the five girls showed up for their lessons, and ran to hug Zhu Shu.<p>
  “We’ve missed  you!” they chorused.<p>
  Zhu Shu gave  hugs all around, before leading them inside to be introduced to Ranma and  Akane, whom she had talked into being sparring partners. She frowned at the cat  Usagi was carrying, but Usagi swore Luna would behave herself. Zhu Shu nodded,  but made a note to watch and make sure the cat wasn’t distracting the girls. <p>
  But it wasn’t  the moon-marked feline who caused problems. Ranma took one look at the girls,  screamed, and fell over twitching. Luna jumped down and walked over to the  prostrate boy and meowed worriedly.<p>
  Genma came  running into the dojo following Ranma’s scream, but was quickly pelted out  again when he started yelling about how his son was such a failure and began  calling him names. Zhu Shu and Akane finally took the unfortunate boy to his  room to lie down and recover from whatever it was, before returning to give the  girls their lessons.<p>
  Zhu Shu felt the  cat’s eyes upon her the entire time, making token attempts to appear as if she  was washing whenever she or Akane looked directly at her, but by the end of  class, Zhu Shu had studied her aura enough to know she wasn’t an ordinary cat.  She sent the girls to the shuttered off side room to get dressed, but shut the  door on the cat when she tried to follow them out.<p>
  “Wha- uh- Meow?”  The startled cat said as the door closed in her face. She turned to look at Zhu  Shu, then backed up hastily at the sight of a burning green sword an inch from  her little nose.<p>
  “Not fool Zhu  Shu. Not cat! What?!” the annoyed Mandarin girl asked.<p>
  “Meow?” Luna  tried again.<p>
  “No good. Heard  start to talk! Watch Senshi too close! You spy?” Her eyes narrowed. “Maybe Zhu  Shu should kill!”<p>
  “Me- uh- Oh no!  Wait!” The bemooned cat cried as Zhu Shu’s sword sank into the floor a  whisker’s-width from a paw. Then she jumped as the other blade descended. “I AM  NOT A SPY!” she yelled desperately.<p>
  The blade  stopped a fraction of an inch from Luna’s nose. Zhu Shu looked down the glowing  length. “Why watch Sailor Moon so close? Answer good! Zhu Shu have no patience  with lie.”<p>
  Luna looked at  her wide-eyed. “Y-y-y-you know she’s Sailor Moon?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu ask  questions.” She tapped Luna’s nose with the point of her sword for emphasis.<p>
  Luna clapped  both paws over the sensitive organ. “I’m her Guardian!” she yelped.<p>
  Zhu Shu tilted  her head. Her aura said she was telling the truth. She nodded and put her  swords away. “Humph! Should have said so. Why no have girls trained? Lucky no  one kill yet!”<p>
  “No one’s  supposed to know who they are!” Luna protested. “So they’ll be safe! They  shouldn’t have told you!”<p>
  “They not. Zhu  Shu have good vision. See aura. No matter if in costume.”<p>
  “You can see  their auras?!”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Yes.  See aura. How know cat not lie.”<p>
  “Eeep!”<p>
  “Still no  answer. Why no train?!”<p>
  “They’re <em>Sailor Senshi</em>! Reincarnated warriors of  the Moon Kingdom! They <em>know</em> how to fight!” Luna yelled.<p>
  “That why Zhu  Shu break bones and take wands away?” She tilted her head and sighed. A quick  motion slid the door aside to let the five girls tumble in, Usagi as usual  landing on her chin as the other Senshi fell on top of her. Zhu Shu glared at  Luna. “And now raise voice in dojo with paper wall!”<p>
  Luna stared at  the semi-dressed girls, then raised her eyes to an Akane Tendo who was standing  in only her bra and panties, the shirt she had been about to put on still held  in frozen hands.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.  She’d heard. Zhu Shu was very glad the dojo was so isolated from the main  house, or a major disaster might have ensued. She felt she could trust Akane  and her sisters, and probably Ranma, but Genma would have been a major problem.<p>
  She looked down  at the tangle of fifteen-year-olds and frowned. “Usagi! You leader of Senshi!  Should behave better! Be example! Not first listen at door!”<p>
  Usagi groaned, “My  chin’s broken!”<p>
  “Poor bunny. Now  up! Zhu Shu see girls dressed, in dojo, five minute! Or else!” She raised her  look to Akane. “Akane too! Five minute!” She turned to Luna, a knife and a wok  appearing in her hands.<p>
  “Wh-wh-what are  you doing?” Luna said as she backed up and up.<p>
  “Zhu Shu tries  remember recipe for Cat Tongue!”<p>
  “Eeep!” Luna  cried and looked for a place to run, but there wasn’t one...<p>
  Fortunately, Zhu  Shu wasn’t serious about the recipe. By the time the girls came out four  minutes later, Zhu Shu’s show having been sufficient motivation for speed, she  had laid out a light snack of rice and stir-fried vegetables. She noted their  apprehensive looks, but waited till they were all seated.<p>
  “Usagi. Why keep  Zhu Shu secret from Guardian?”<p>
  “Um-“ Usagi  hemmed.<p>
  “Luna! You be  upset Usagi tell about Zhu Shu?” Zhu Shu’s gaze caught the cat in a driving  glare.<p>
  “Uh- Of course  not!”<p>
  “Not tell all  truth, cat! Now know Zhu Shu. What then?”<p>
  “Well- maybe.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Better.  Zhu Shu meet Senshi on Hikawa Shrine. Mistook Zhu Shu for Cardian. Nearly kill,  but realize mistake. Take care of Zhu Shu. Zhu Shu wake, see Sailor Mars as  Rei. Recognize. Mars decide better off if friends. Zhu Shu have dangerous  knowledge. Good idea, yes no?”<p>
  Luna nodded.<p>
  “Zhu Shu show  why should train. Take wand, break bones. Make point. Senshi listen. Zhu Shu  help in own way to fight evil.”<p>
  “That’s  wonderful!” Luna exclaimed<p>
  “Usagi! Should  have told Guardian. Small mistake. Understandable in young girl.”<p>
  Usagi blushed  shamefacedly.<p>
  “Now must deal  with consequences.” She turned to Akane. “Know of Sailor Senshi?”<p>
  Akane nodded  furiously.<p>
  “Better than Zhu  Shu when first meet, then.” She turned to the others. “Senshi, Make Up and  introduce selves. Is only polite when meet new friend.” She turned her  attention to her bowl of rice. The girls all looked at each other, then at  Luna, who was apparently totally fascinated with her bowl of shrimp in a cream  sauce.<p>
  Finally Rei  nodded. “She’s right, and we really only have ourselves to blame.” She stood. “Rei  Hino.” She brought out her pen. “Mars Power, Make up!”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>A half hour  later, Zhu Shu waved goodbye to the cheerful Senshi. A bemused and still  slightly dazed Akane stood next to her. <em>Still,</em> Akane thought, <em>who wouldn’t be? Next to  that near-invasion of the world by the alien Oni, the Senshi have been the most  popular news item in Japan  for the last few years. And now, I know them personally. What’s next? Space  visitors?</em><p>
  A hum in the air  made her look up as a tiger-striped saucer dropped down to hover over the dojo.  She stared as a hatch opened in the bottom, and Japan’s Number One Famous Alien  poked her horned head out. “Konichiwa, Zhu Shu. Have you seen Darling? He ran  away again!”<p>
  Zhu Shu waved. “Ni  hao, Lum. Zhu Shu not seen Ataru. Found Ranma!”<p>
  “Wonderful!” The  Oni flew down to give Zhu Shu a hug. “Is this where you disappeared to?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Must  come visit. Zhu Shu miss first friend in Japan.”<p>
  “Okay. But I  have to find Darling! He ran away to be with Shinobu again!”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Understand.  Come visit!”<p>
  “I will. Saucer!  Remember this address!” She gave Zhu Shu another quick hug and flew up to her  ship. “Bai-bai! See you soon!” With a further hum, the saucer shot out of  sight.<p>
  Zhu Shu turned  to apologize for her eccentric friend, but a wide-eyed Akane stopped her. “Is  there anyone famous in Japan  you <em>aren’t</em> friends with?”<p>
  Mischievousness  won. She giggled and gave Akane a peck on the cheek. “Zhu Shu not meet Emperor  yet!” She vanished into the house.<p>
  After all the  shocks she had gotten, it was a relief for Akane to beat the tar out of Ranma  when he insulted her figure after Kasumi and Nabiki dressed him in one of Akane’s  outfits because all of his were in the wash. In fact, upon reflection, it was  the most normal thing she’d had happen all afternoon.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Saturday  afternoon found Nabiki going over the school schedule with Zhu Shu.<p>
  “Now, I managed  to get you put into my homeroom, so I can help you get adjusted, and we can  work out a deal for me to help you get up to speed on your schoolwork. However,  it’s only fair to warn you that most of the boys at our school are hentai, and  were rather fixated on my little sister. They may have claimed to have given up  on her since she’s engaged to Ranma, but that just means they’re looking for a  new target.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Zhu  Shu understands. She spend week at Tomobiki. Have deal with Hentai squad.”<p>
  Nabiki shrugged.  “I’d almost suggest letting your preferences be known, but that might cause you  more problems. One, it’d get you labeled as a pervert while not necessarily  keeping the boys from chasing you, and second, it might make you a target for  Ai.”<p>
  “Ai?”<p>
  “The head of our  cheerleading squad. She’s been fuming since Akane’s the only girl in Furinkan  who can beat her, and with Kuno’s proclamation, she lost her place as the focus  of the school’s Hentai Squad. And to top it off, she likes girls as much as she  likes guys. There’s no telling if she’d ask you for a date or a duel.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu see.”  She shrugged. “Zhu Shu no can change. Tomobiki boys not leave alone, even when  Zhu Shu hide. Give her many presents.”<p>
  Nabiki raised an  eyebrow. “Oh? Like what?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Rei  supposed to bring today.”<p>
  The doorbell  rang. Nabiki raised an eyebrow in the general direction of the door. “My, what  coincidental timing.”<p>
  There was the  sound of Kasumi opening the door and starting to say hello, but it was replaced  by a surprised squeal and a rumble, followed by silence.<p>
  Zhu Shu was down  the steps followed almost as quickly by Ranma, then Nabiki and Akane. At the  front door, they found a sheepish Rei helping Kasumi dig herself out of a pile  of stuffed animals. The pile completely filled the doorway to a height of a  couple of feet, and the pile grew larger outside, where a large delivery box  had given way from the pressure of the stuffies within. <p>
  Rei saw Zhu Shu  and gave her an apologetic smile. “I guess I shouldn’t have tried to put them  all in one box.”<p>
  Kasumi finally  regained her feet, a Mokona stuffie poking out of her apron top. “Oh my!  Wherever did you come by such a collection?”<p>
  Zhu Shu lowered  her eyes. “Boys at Tomobiki give as gifts. Try to get Zhu Shu to date with  them.” Zhu Shu grabbed a huge Pikachu and held it against her. “Zhu Shu think  are cute,” she said defensively at the raised eyebrows from the Tendo sisters  and Ranma.<p>
  Ranma surveyed  the massive pile of stuffed animals. “An’ we gotta take these upstairs? Ah man,  that’s going to take all day.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him  big pleading eyes. “But they cute!”<p>
  Nabiki couldn’t  hold in the laughter anymore... </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Monday morning  was a change of pace, as it was Zhu Shu’s first day of school. Her grandfather’s  permission had arrived on Sunday along with paperwork detailing her “schooling”.  She smiled at Sung Po’s signature on the paperwork. At least it seemed the  local magistrate did not hold her choice to try and not have to marry his son  against her. Her Grandfather had also sent her a letter to tell her that Ke Lun  had met with him and advised him of her current quest. She had his blessing and  approval. He also informed her that Pin Ke had showed up in town, looking for  yet another rematch. She had been irate to find Zhu Shu gone. Lin Ke had been,  as always, apologetic for her sister. Zhu Shu had sighed at that. One day, she’d  have to deal with Pin Ke once and for all; only her friendship with Lin Ke had  prevented her from paying Pin Ke back for all she and Ying-Ying had endured  from the bullying girl as they grew up. The girl from the next village had a  lot to answer for, and not just to her. Shan Pu had had stories of Pin Ke to  tell, too.<p>
  Still, she had  what she needed for her current quest, so that morning found her walking to  school with Nabiki. They talked about Ranma and Akane - and other topics -  until they arrived at Furinkan High.<p>
  Kuno was  waiting.<p>
  “Ah, Nabik- Oh!  Can it be? My beautiful Chinese Goddess! Oh! As the Apple tree doth shake off  the snow and lift its branches to the sun of spring, so does my heart throw off  the cold snows of its desolation at the joyous return of your beauty! Yea, my  heart doth rejoice at the happy fates which hath returned you to me, my  goddess!” He lunged to envelop Zhu Shu.<p>
  Zhu Shu had  forgotten about Kuno. She leaped straight up, and as his arms closed around  air, did a back-flip to land on the post by the gate, both swords coming out.<p>
  Nabiki watched  from half-lidded eyes. “Interesting...”<p>
  Kuno’s bokken  had appeared in his hands as tears of gladness streamed from his eyes. “My  goddess, I rejoice at your challenge for my favor! Happily will I allow you to  date with me if I,  Kuno, should lose!”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Zhu  Shu not date Kuno!” He was completely oblivious to her protest as he closed in.  She leaped above his attack as his bokken shattered a three-foot section of the  wall. She landed behind him as he whirled. Green fire flickered along her blade  as she moved to parry him and slice through the wooden blade.<p>
  Thunder rumbled  as the swords connected and Zhu Shu’s sword barely nicked the bokken. Kuno  retaliated with a super-fast blur of thrusts which Zhu Shu bounced away from,  her momentary handstand revealing the pink panties under her short skirt, which  drew a whistle of appreciation from the boys watching the fight. She dodged  another flurry of blows and leaped, her ribbons swirling in a cyclone around  her. Thirty feet above Kuno, her ribbons snapped into a tight spiral as she  cried “Dragon Tail Whip.” A ball of green fire arrowed down to envelop Kuno in  a rumbling explosion.<p>
  The clearing  smoke revealed Kuno, his clothes in tatters, standing in a small crater, the  shattered remains of his bokken in hand. Wind whistled as he blinked twice, and  then, like a toppling tree, he slowly fell over, unconscious.<p>
  Zhu Shu landed  at the edge of the crater and for several seconds, silence reigned. Then a buzz  of conversation broke out all around.<p>
  “Who is she?”<p>
  “Gods, she’s  cute!”<p>
  “Did you see  what she did to Kuno?”<p>
  “Humph! Well,  anyone would look cute to you if they wore a skirt like that!”<p>
  Nabiki stepped  up to Zhu Shu as she put her swords away. “Well, I see you’ve already met Kuno.  Come on. We wouldn’t want you to be late on your first day of school!” She led  the Chinese girl inside by the elbow.<p>
  Ranma and Akane  arrived a few minutes later, and stared at the devastation.<p>
  “Hmm, I have a  feeling that Zhu Shu is already here,” Akane said.<p>
  A drop of sweat  rolled down Ranma’s temple. “Remind me not to get her mad at me. And to get her  to teach me how she does that.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Things went well  that morning for Zhu Shu, even though she was in the same homeroom as Nabiki  and Kuno. After the second eraser, Kuno had been sent into the hall with a  bucket and Zhu Shu had had some peace. Then lunchtime had arrived.<p>
  She had been  walking towards Nabiki when a student tripped because he was watching her  instead of where he was going, and with unerring accuracy, the curse had  brought his glass of ice water down on her thin sleeveless dress.<p>
  The dress pulled  tight as she gained nine inches in height, and a cup size. For a single long  moment, no one moved as the blonde dragon-girl stood motionless, then a riot of  conversation broke out across the lunchroom. <p>
  Nabiki arrived a  second later with a kettle of warm water and a muttered “I should have guessed,”  but the damage had been done. For the rest of lunch, Zhu Shu was stared at, and  finally, one of the Hentai Squad got brave enough to dump another glass of cold  water on her.<p>
  After that, it  was nonstop. Every time she changed back to normal, another “accident” would  happen. She gave up on hot water, at least till every male was gone from the  lunchroom. She was very glad her dress wasn’t white, damp as it was by the end  of lunch. Then, to make a bad situation worse, she ended up having to hold a  bucket of water in the hall for being late to class because she had had to wait  till everyone had left the lunchroom before she could get hot water.<p>
  Then at gym  class, she had to admire the ingenuity of the “accident” that soaked her on the  bench of the softball field, and she hoped the Hentai Squad had enjoyed the wet  tee shirt, because she had sent most of them to the nurse’s office. And then  had to knock out Kuno, now madly in love with his “Sun-Gold Dragon Maiden”...<p>
  And all the  while, she was the subject of intense scrutiny by five sets of eyes.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The tall, busty  blonde watched as Zhu Shu disappeared into the girls changing room and gave a  slight frown. This new girl was formidable, possibly even a match for her, and  the way the Hentai Squad was chasing her irritated her. She was going to have  to teach the fools who the beauties of Furinkan High still were.<p>
  “She’s kind of  cute,” said the blonde next to her, “and she’s got that gymnastic figure you  like. Thinking of asking her out?”<p>
  The blonde  looked over. “Maybe later, Megumi. Once we’ve shown her who’s in charge around  here. I think she needs to be shown what’s acceptable at Furinkan.”<p>
  “Yes,” said the  tall raven haired girl on her other side. “After all, everyone knows only we’re  allowed to dress that sexy. Right, Ai?”<p>
  Ai nodded as the  red head in the group gave a huff from where she was watching the unconscious  boys being hauled off the field. “You’d think from their behavior, they think  she’s prettier than me!”<p>
  “But she is  prettier, Kaede. I saw her up close in the lunchroom. And she has a better  figure,” the last girl spoke up.<p>
  “Shut up, Kyoko!”<p>
  “But it’s only  the truth-“ The short girl with curly chestnut hair broke off as Ai turned.<p>
  “Enough. I’ll  decide who’s prettier later. Maybe I’ll even give her a collar. But first, we’re  going to show Little Miss China  her place.” </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The school day  finally ended, and a still-damp Zhu Shu met Nabiki by her locker. “Zhu Shu  seriously think tell boys she only like girls,” the Chinese girl said in  frustration. “Then maybe Zhu Shu get through day in dry dress.”<p>
  “Well, I could  have prepared you a little better if you’d told me about your curse,” Nabiki  replied. <em>And I could have had a camera  ready at lunch,</em> she thought. Her pocketbook had already gained a pleasant  weight from the few pics she had gotten during lunch and at gym. Kuno had paid  triple for the wet tee shirt pics. Zhu Shu was going to be a gold mine. The  only worrisome part was that Ai had bought one of the wet tee shirt pics too.<p>
  “Zhu Shu has  grown used to. Forgot.” She shrugged. “Zhu Shu just need remember not wear  white dress.”<p>
  Nabiki watched  the students hurrying to the front of the school and sighed. She had figured  this was inevitable, and had told her factors to handle the bets, but for once  a guilty conscience nagged at her. As they approached the front doors, Nabiki  stopped Zhu Shu. “Wait.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  at her. “Yes?”<p>
  “Give me your  books. And... And be prepared to get in a fight when you go out those doors.”<p>
  Zhu Shu tilted  her head curiously. “What Nabiki mean?”<p>
  “The rumor mill’s  been going all afternoon, ever since your gym class. You remember I warned you  about Ai?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  “I think that  she and the rest of the cheerleaders are waiting for you out there.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Challenge.”  she said quietly. Nabiki nodded.<p>
  Zhu Shu handed  her book bag to Nabiki, then reached behind her back and drew her swords. She  detached her ribbons from the pommels and returned the blades, drawing out the  wooden practice swords she used to spar. After tying the ribbons back in place,  she nodded at Nabiki. “Zhu Shu is ready.”<p>
  The large  entrance area had already had the crater left from that morning repaired, and  as Zhu Shu and Nabiki stepped out of the building, they saw a crowd had  gathered to either side. Ranma and Akane stood off to the side of the door,  Ranma’s fists clenching and unclenching as he looked at the blonde girl waiting  in the center of the cleared area, surrounded by the other four girls of her  squad. When he saw Zhu Shu he stepped up and growled, “Those girls said they  were waiting to challenge you.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu knows.”<p>
  “All five of  them.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  “That’s not  right. Five on one isn’t fair, even if they are girls.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised  her eyebrow. “Ranma.”<p>
  “Yeah?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not say  this often, but please to shut up.” She stalked forward, her ribbons lashing.<p>
  “What I’d say?”  Ranma asked, looking in puzzlement at the annoyed Chinese girl.<p>
  Nabiki gave him  an amused look. “Offhand, I’d say you insulted her with that remark.” <p>
  Zhu Shu paid the  spectators no further attention as she approached the blonde girl in the lead,  examining their matching blue tops, yellow skirts, and black shoes with white  socks. The word Furinkan was written in Romanji across their chests, and their  hands were concealed inside fluffy blue and yellow pompoms. Their stances were  not typical martial arts, but she could tell they held themselves ready to move  in any direction. Their leader almost oozed confidence.<p>
  Individually,  Zhu Shu would rate them decent martial artists, though not a challenge to her  skill. Together was something else. She had no way to gauge how well they may  work as a group. She stopped in front of the leader and gave a half bow before  raising and meeting her opponents gaze.<p>
  “Nabiki say you  wish challenge Zhu Shu.”<p>
  The blonde gave  her a nasty smile. “Challenge makes it sound like you have a chance. I’m here  to teach you your place. We’re the only ones allowed to put the boys around  here in the nurse’s office.”<p>
  “And are?” <p>
  The leader  motioned to the blonde by her side, who struck a pose with one pompom raised  and the other at her side as she gave Zhu Shu an appraising look. “Megumi  Ohtama.”<p>
  The second girl  struck a pose the opposite of the one the first girl had taken on the leaders  other side. “Ayeka Hibishi.”<p>
  The red head in  the group knelt before the raven haired girl, her pompoms held out behind her  in a pose that showed off her generous chest. “Kaede Miyaki.”<p>
  The last girl,  with curly chestnut hair, duplicated the red head’s pose on the opposite side. “Kyoko  Onamuri.”<p>
  Then the leader  stepped forward and took a pose that showed her figure off to the point that  Zhu Shu had to sniff. “And I am Ai Konjou. The Captain of Furinkan’s Combat  Cheerleading Squad, and greatest Combat Cheerleader in the world!”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Song  Zhu Shu. Clan Dragon. Heir to Song   School of Sword Dance.”  She took a stance, watching Ai’s eyes to see if Nabiki’s statement was true. Ai’s  eyes roamed over her as a lascivious smile crept across her face. <p>
  “Once we’ve  punished you for the mistreatment of our men, perhaps I’ll allow you to be my  play-toy. You’d look cute in a collar,” Ai said as she finished her mental  stripping of Zhu Shu. Ayeka gave Ai a momentary forlorn look before focusing on  Zhu Shu, hatred burning in her eyes. <p>
  Zhu Shu’s stance  didn’t waver. “Zhu Shu sees.”<p>
  The attack came  without warning, as the two cheerleaders who where kneeling suddenly launched  their pompoms at Zhu Shu. She jumped straight up, the world slowing as she  shifted to combat time, noting in passing the thin wires between the pompoms  that would have entangled her legs.<p>
  However, fast as  she had moved, Ai had matched her, stepping back into a cradle formed by the  hands of Ayeka and Megumi and being launched after the Chinese girl. Zhu Shu’s  ribbons surrounded her as she deflected the half-dozen batons Ai launched at  her, then they reached out towards the cheerleader as Zhu Shu sought to  incapacitate her.<p>
  Ai was too  slippery, though, and managed to dodge the fast moving ribbons. As Zhu Shu  alighted, Ai was caught by the pair who had tossed her. She smiled at Zhu Shu. “Oh,  you are quite the nimble one, aren’t you? This should be fun.”<p>
  Zhu Shu barely  had a hint of a flash of silver before a pair of batons impacted her back and  threw her forward. Ai jumped up as Megumi and Ayeka caught Zhu Shu and tossed  her up to where the Captain was finishing a midair twist that planted her feet  firmly in Zhu Shu’s back and launched her face-first towards the school wall.<p>
  Zhu Shu fought  past the loss of air from the kick and managed to yell “Dragon’s Egg Shield” as  she curled into a ball. A glowing sphere of green energy surrounded her as she  crashed into the wall, shattering the concrete before rolling to her feet on  the other side of the wall.<p>
  Ai was dusting  her hands, and looked disappointed when Zhu Shu reappeared above the wall. The  Chinese girl’s swords burned with a green fire. “Now you make Zhu Shu annoyed.”<p>
  Ai smiled. “Good,  that might make this fight more of a challenge. Exploding Pompom Attack!”<p>
  Zhu Shu vanished  into a green blur as the wall disintegrated in multiple blast clouds from the  small pellets the bouncing girls were launching from their pompoms. A trail of  explosions trailed behind the elusive Chinese girl as she zigzagged across the  field, then through the gathered cheerleaders. There was a cry of surprise as  Kyoko vanished, to reappear tied to a tree a second later. Zhu Shu stood beside  the helpless girl. “One down, four go,” she said with a level look at Ai.<p>
  “Way to go,  Zhu-chan!” Ranma yelled from the sidelines. Zhu Shu spared him a second’s  glance, glad that she hadn’t yet had to yell at him to stay out of a personal  challenge.<p>
  Ai gave Zhu Shu  a look that would maim most people. “That will cost you!”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  over the four remaining cheerleaders. “Zhu Shu not think so. Take out cutest  one.”<p>
  “She is not the  cutest one!” Kaede screamed. “I am!”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook  her head no. “Not to Zhu Shu. Think little red haired girl have too thick  waist.”<p>
  “Why, you witch!  I’ll rip out your eyes for that!” Kaede started forward, surrounded by a pink  aura.<p>
  “Kaede, get back  here! She’s trying to separate us!” Ai yelled, but the other girl was too far  gone in rage to listen. She met Zhu Shu in a furious barrage of batons as they  disappeared in a cloud of dust.<p>
  “Oh, fuck,” Ai  said, then turned to two remaining girls. “Time to pull out the big guns.”<p>
  The dust was  sucked into a whirlwind as a furiously spinning Zhu Shu rose above the cloud,  trailing an ensnared Kaede. At the apex of her arc, the cheerleader managed to  free herself with a triumphant cheer that ended in a pained groan as she  crashed into the branches of a tree. <p>
  Ai whirled  furiously, trying to find the vanished Chinese girl to no avail. Then a voice  whispered in her ear, “If want date, could have asked Zhu Shu.”<p>
  She spun to find  the Chinese girl standing right behind her. “Cheerleader bomb!” Ai screamed.<p>
  Zhu Shu didn’t  quite dodge fast enough to avoid the twin pompoms that landed at her feet and  exploded.<p>
  “Zhu Shu!” Ranma  cried out in anguish as he started forward, but as the smoke cleared, he saw  Zhu Shu was still standing. Her dress was shredded and she was blackened with  soot, but seemed okay. She gave him a warning glance before smiling at Ai.<p>
  “Zhu Shu should  warn Ai. Clan Dragon very strong against fire.”<p>
  The cocky smile  was perfect, but it distracted Zhu Shu long enough for Megumi and Ayeka to do a  synchronized “Air Kick!” Zhu Shu was flung across the yard to land with a  splash in the fountain. She emerged like a wrathful water dragon, her emerald  green eyes burning. The tattered remains of her dress had been unequal to the  stress of her change, though, and nosebleeds broke out across the crowd.<p>
  Ai found herself  staring as the blonde dragon girl launched herself skyward, her jump seeming to  reach nearly impossible heights. Her ribbons swirled around her as she cried “Dragon  Wing Blast!”<p>
  The glow around  her swords brightened as she raised them above her head, then brought them down  like a pair of wings and pointed them at Megumi and Ayeka. A solid blast of chi  slammed into the ground between the pair and a shockwave hurled them from their  feet. <p>
  As the dust  settled Zhu Shu landed between the unconscious girls and knelt, her breath  coming in short gasps as she tried to recover from the massive chi blast. Ai  simply stood watching her, a small trickle of blood running down her upper lip  . Finally, Zhu Shu raised her head, her emerald green eyes fixing on Ai’s blue  ones.<p>
  “Four down. Must  Zhu Shu defeat Ai too?”<p>
  Ai started, and  looked around at the rest of her squad, then at the exhausted Chinese girl. She  wiped the blood away from her lip and gave Zhu Shu an appraising look. “I’m  willing to call it a draw.” <p>
  Zhu Shu’s head  bowed slightly. “Zhu Shu will call draw.”<p>
  Ai crossed her  arms. “Another time, then. Next time, we will beat you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Zhu  Shu sees.”<p>
  Then Ranma was  there with a jacket for Zhu Shu, and while Akane ran interference, he escorted  Zhu Shu away from the cheering crowd.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“Are you okay?”  Ranma asked after they had cleared the school grounds.<p>
  “Zhu Shu fine.  Just had to recover. Lose temper and use too much chi.”<p>
  “What kind of  crazy stunt were you pulling back there. Why’d you take on all five?”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him  a dirty look. “They challenged. Zhu Shu honor to defend.”<p>
  “Yeah, but-“<p>
  “But nothing.  Ranma seem forget that Zhu Shu not flower. Can protect self! Zhu Shu maybe take <em>you</em>, if really tried.”<p>
  “You ain’t that  good, Zhu-chan,” Ranma said. “You may be faster than me, and have a few fancy  techniques, but you don’t have the strength or endurance.”<p>
  “Ranma so sure?  Zhu Shu not show Ranma all knows. Girls challenge, Zhu Shu answer! Could take  Ai maybe, if not lose temper. Her only real threat.”<p>
  “She’s more of a  danger than you might think, Zhu Shu,” Akane said as she caught up to them. “She’s  notorious for making sure she gets her way... and she’s known for carrying  grudges for years.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Will  deal with as comes.”<p>
  “Don’t worry  about her, Zhu-chan. I got your back.”<p>
  Zhu Shu whirled  to confront Ranma, the jacket falling off her shoulders with the speed of her  turn. “Zhu Shu not need watch back! Does Ranma think Zhu Shu not warrior? Zhu  Shu train all life be master of Song school!”<p>
  Ranma held up  his hands. “Hey, hey, why are you so angry? You’re my friend. I just want to  make sure you’re okay. Okay?”<p>
  Zhu Shu pulled  the jacket back around her. “Ranma need learn that just because Zhu Shu female  does not mean is weak.”<p>
  “I didn’t say  that!”<p>
  “I seem to  recall you saying just that before Zhu Shu had her fight,” Akane said  helpfully. “I believe the phrase was “even if they are girls.”<p>
  “Yeah, so? Guys  are stronger than girls.”<p>
  “Oh yeah?” Akane  punched him in the shoulder. There was a startled yelp as Ranma was knocked off  the side of the bridge they were crossing.<p>
  There was a  splash, and then the sputtering redhead pulled himself back on the bridge. “Whaddja  do that for?”<p>
  “I’m strong  enough to knock you off a bridge!”<p>
  “That’s because  you’re an unfeminine tomboy!”<p>
  Zhu Shu pushed  the unprepared redhead off the bridge again. Looking down at the just surfacing  girl, she called down. “Zhu Shu strong enough to push off bridge, too. Make her  tomboy?”<p>
  Ranma growled as  he jumped back up to the bridge. “Okay, okay. So you’re both mad at me. I get  the picture.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook  her head. “Zhu Shu not think do.” She sighed as she snuggled the jacket tighter  around her shoulders. “Does Ranma even know why upset?”<p>
  The sullen  female shrugged. “No.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed  even harder as Akane rolled her eyes and muttered “baka” under her breath. Zhu  Shu turned to her. “You no help. Why insult instead of explain?”<p>
  “Wha-“ Akane  sputtered. “But he’s the idiot!”<p>
  “Who you calling  an idiot, you uncute-“ Zhu Shu’s hand over his mouth muffled the rest of the  insult.<p>
  “Can please have  conversation, not insult? Zhu Shu too tired referee.”<p>
  The pair of them  glared at each other, but were silent. Zhu Shu nodded. “You two on edge since  other night. Zhu Shu want know why.”<p>
  “Because he’s a  baka!” Akane spat.<p>
  “You were the  one looking for a fight!”<p>
  A hand went over  both mouths. They looked at Zhu Shu, once more minus the jacket that had fallen  off when she had reached up with both hands. “Will please stop yell?”<p>
  Grudging nods  followed. Zhu Shu bent over to pick up the jacket again, watching Akane out of  the corner of her eye.<p>
  She was  watching, rather than glaring at Ranma. Settling the jacket around her  shoulders again, Zhu Shu asked, “Does Akane think Zhu Shu friend?”<p>
  “Of course I do!”<p>
  “Why?”<p>
  Akane gaped as  her mouth opened and closed a few times. “Um... um... because you are. I mean,  you’ve listened to me, and... Um... well, you saved Kasumi from those muggers.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu would  have done anyway. Not do out of friendship. Do cause have no choice. Why else?”<p>
  Akane looked  sidelong at Ranma, who was sullenly trudging along beside them. “Because...  because you asked me to be, and you’ve acted like a friend.”<p>
  “Ah. Ranma. Why  you friend with Zhu Shu?”<p>
  “Huh? Because we  made friends in China.  You know that.”<p>
  “Has Akane asked  to be friend?”<p>
  Akane looked  startled, and looked over at Ranma.<p>
  “Yeah, she asked  me. Then she found out I was a guy and started insulting me.”<p>
  “What happen?”<p>
  “She walked in  on me in the bath!”<p>
  “He looked at me  naked!”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  back and forth at the simultaneous answers, blinking. <p>
  “You could have  knocked!”<p>
  “I was expecting  a girl! Why should I knock!”<p>
  “I would have!”<p>
  “It’s my house!”<p>
  Zhu Shu  whistled. When the two of them turned to look at her, she nodded. “So, why that  so bad? Ranma see Zhu Shu naked. Akane see Zhu Shu naked. Zhu Shu mostly naked  now.”<p>
  Akane glared at  Ranma. “Because... because... He’s a pervert!”<p>
  “I am not!”<p>
  “Akane. Why  Ranma pervert for looking at Akane?”<p>
  “Because a guy’s  not supposed to see a girl naked until they’re married!” <p>
  “So why is okay  for Ranma see Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Akane blinked,  nonplussed.<p>
  “Ah, jeez,  Zhu-chan. You’re like my sister. I couldn’t think of you like that!” Ranma  protested<p>
  Akane looked at  Ranma and blinked. Finally Akane shrugged. “You showed me what happened when  you taught Ranma about girls. I- I just-“ she trailed off.<p>
  “No be jealous?”  Zhu Shu supplied.<p>
  Akane was  silent, but Ranma gave her a wide-eyed look and blinked. “Jealous?”<p>
  “Why would I be  jealous over you?” Akane snarled. “It’s not like you’re some prize catch or  anything!”<p>
  “Oh yeah, well  at least I’m not sexless!”<p>
  “Ranma?” Zhu Shu  interrupted before things got any further out of hand. <p>
  “Yeah?”<p>
  “What you think  if Zhu Shu say she wish her in Ranma place. Zhu Shu think Akane very sexy.”<p>
  Akane blushed as  Ranma kicked a stone. “But she’s always acting like a boy!”<p>
  Akane’s blush  turned to fury as her hand balled into a fist, but Zhu Shu stopped her. “What  Ranma judge against?” she asked, a touch of anger in her tone.<p>
  Ranma’s eyes  locked on hers as he realized the trap he had just set for himself, and he  swallowed hard.<p>
  Zhu Shu stepped  up to the redhead and poked her between the breasts. “You make vow on honor  Saotome name! You no have honor?”<p>
  Ranma sighed. “I’m  sorry, Zhu Shu.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not one  should apologize to,” she said as she turned her back on him.<p>
  Ranma stopped  walking as she seemed to deflate. “Akane?”<p>
  Akane had stopped  too, but was studiously not looking at the redhead. “Yes.”<p>
  “I’m sorry for  calling you a tomboy. Zhu Shu’s right. I- I-”<p>
  “I accept your  apology.”<p>
  Ranma nodded. “And  look, I’m sorry I didn’t warn you about my curse right away. I-I just didn’t  think you’d believe me, and I wasn’t really wanting to get engaged. My old man  just kinda sprang it on me, then knocked me unconscious and dragged me there.”<p>
  Akane sighed. “My  dad told us about it right before you got there.”<p>
  “So maybe Ranma  and Akane give each other chance? Zhu Shu know Ranma arrogant, and Zhu Shu must  still break of notion that boys better than girls, but he can be trained.”<p>
  “Hey,” Ranma  protested as Akane giggled.<p>
  “And Akane can  have short temper, but she just want respect.”<p>
  Akane raised an  eyebrow at the Chinese girl, but kept silent.<p>
  “Now, maybe  Ranma and Akane start over? Be friends? Worry about fiancé stuff later?”<p>
  A wind whistled  through the silence as the two stood looking at each other before Ranma stuck  out his hand. “Friends?”<p>
  Akane looked at  the proffered hand for a long moment before nodding as she took his hand. “You’re  still the most aggravating male I know, Ranma Saotome.”<p>
  “Would not be  Ranma if not,” Zhu Shu chimed in. “Is part of Saotome charm.”<p>
  Both girls  giggled as Ranma let out another “hey” in protest. <p>
  “Now, can please  get home? Jacket very drafty.”<p>
  Akane and Ranma  both laughed as they stepped up beside the dragon girl and began walking again,  the tension between them currently fading.<p>
  And on a rooftop  behind them, red eyes watched them from the shadows before a dark figure  slipped over the edge of the roof and vanished.</p>
