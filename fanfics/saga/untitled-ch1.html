<pre>It hurts.

Do you know how much it hurts?

It hurts so much, dying is not enough to free me from this torment.

Oh, my Prince, my Charm Prince, where are you? Are you not coming to 
save me? To free me from this horrid body? To free me from my anger? 
My fear? Have I not served you well? I gave you the clothes you wear. 
I worked so hard in that attic of mine, slaving hour over hour to work 
that difficult fabric, just for you. It fitted perfectly. It matched 
the color of your eyes, your hair. I served the Charm Lord well by 
doing what it is I do best. Making clothing. But he took me away from 
Maria. He knew of my connection to you. My feelings...

Do I not deserve your attention?

Am I not worthy of your love? I have done nothing but dreamed of the 
day you will come for me. And when I thought that day had came, you 
left me. Left me alone with my dreams and hopes all over the floor. I 
had loved you before you were even Born. And when you came to me, for 
me, I had loved you again. My Charm Prince. You were not a Prince nor 
a Lord, but a Princess. A Lady. The legend was right, but it was 
wrong. So very wrong. You were to take me with you. Yet, you left me. 
And when you left me, I were to hate you. And yet I still loved you.

What is this that I&#39;m feeling? Desires. Wants. Needs. I am nothing but 
human; you, on the other hand, are like a god. God. Not Goddess. 
Half-human, half-Mystic. Does it shock you that I would know? I know 
everything about you, my Prince.

I have loved you before you were Born.

I lay here now. Empty. In pain. Incomplete. Without you. And you? 
Where are you? What are you feeling? Are you feeling my pain? My 
lonliness? My desire for your love? Does it burn like my skin does? 
This cursed body which feeds off my soul..it burns. Oh how it burns. 
But it is cold compared for my faith in you. My Lady, my Prince. 
Charming Prince. You, who brings healing with your words. Your gaze. 
Your touch..

Please come and save me. I have waited for so long..

Oh the voices..they sound so familiar. And the cries. Yes, my Prince, 
I have sat here in this cursed place, listening to the cries of my 
people. The cries of the Monsters. The cries. If Iisten closely, I can 
hear the Song of the Asura, that legendary rare sword which only you 
possess. I heard it before, when you left me. You had no other means 
to defend yourself. We all heard its song. I play it over and over 
again, just so I can believe you were only a walk away.

...

What is this? Is that the Song? I must be reliving my memories; you 
yourself said that you would never return to Fascintaru. You wanted so 
badly to leave..And to never return. Not even for me, my Prince.

But..that is it...! The Asura..! I can feel it&#39;s power raditating 
through this body. This..body? It is afraid. I can feel its fear. It 
trembles as your power washes over it. Oh my Prince, how you have 
gotten stronger.. The Song sings straight through my aching heart. It 
is so much closer now.. I can almost taste it&#39;s bloody blade..you, 
after all, sacrificed your own flesh for it. Please, come closer. Let 
me feel that you are here again..

/~Gina?! Where is she? What have you done to her?~/

/~Defeat me and Know..!!~/

..Lady Asellus? My Prince? My Charming Prince? Have you..come back for 
me?

/~Asellus, DON&#39;T!~/

/~What&#39;re you DOING, girl?!~/

/~Wait, Selly!~/

/~We&#39;ll do this TOGETHER!~/

No.

NO.

NO!

Who are all these people?! Why are you not alone here for me? I&#39;m 
so..confused..I can&#39;t...control...Oh my Prince, you have come to save 
me, but I cannot...Oh my Prince! I WISH TO SPEAK!! I WANT TO TELL 
YOU!!

/~KRIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!~/

The pain....oh the pain...why...My Prince..why...

/~Asellus! You can&#39;t do it! What about your..!~/

/~White Rose told you not...!~/

/~No! I need to do this find Gina! She needs me! I need to unlock 
it..! Forgive me, White Rose, for my weakness; I am only 
human...MYSTICAL CHANGE!~/

I could never see before, my Prince..but why did I just see a flash of 
light? Warm, soft green light. It&#39;s soothing my pain..It feels like 
your arms..green light? green? But then..that means...

...

Just for me? You would damn yourself for me?

/~ASURAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!~/

I am not worthy. But being guilty has never felt so good before..Oh my 
Prince do you mean it? Do you dishonor yourself with me to show your 
love? Is this your affection? Your concern? It means so much to 
me..but is it not too late? Won&#39;t I hate you after this? No. I can 
never hate you.

I have loved you before you were Born...

There is a final flood of warm light. It feels sticky though, like 
blood. It&#39;s thick like blood. But is blood supposed to be blue? And 
something..I&#39;m lying on something...And the light..it&#39;s so many colors 
now..wait..I can see? I can touch?

&quot;...Gina? Oh my God..Gina!? You were in the Griffin the entire time?! 
Oh Gina!!&quot; And I can feel a pair of strong arms go around me..shelter 
me..cleanse me...Oh my Prince..you came for me.

&quot;..My Lady? ...My Lady, what has happened....?&quot; I can&#39;t open my eyes. 
No. Because I can&#39;t look upon your gloriousness..

&quot;Oh Gina..Gina please, look at me.. There is nothing glorious about 
me..&quot; I did not know I had spoken out loud. So I look. And I see your 
companions.

There is a purple haired woman.

There is a green, furry boy.

There is a blue haired bard.

There is...Lord...Ildon...? But..What of Princess White Rose..?

And slowly..I turn in your arms to look at you. And I can only look at 
you in shock.

Oh my Lady. Oh my Prince.

You are Beautiful. Oh my Lady, I had never seen those amber eyes 
shining in passion and blazing with strength. I had never seen that 
emerald hair so vibrant and powerfully flowing. I have never seen 
those soft, delicate features hardened into an intensity that burns 
through my soul. You have..Changed. You have Changed. And I...

Your garments..! They are worn and dreary looking. The waistcoat, once 
a proud and violent gold and fuschia color is dull and fraying. The 
breeches torn and stained with blood. Blue blood. Purple blood. Red 
blood. You have worn them hard. They were not the magnificent robes 
that they once were.

I feel pride knowing you wore those clothes like that. Pride, because 
you did not replace them. I can see my expression in your eyes.

And I can feel myself being blown away from bliss as you smile down at 
me. Oh my Prince.

And kiss me gently on the lips.

Your companions say nothing.

And I thank them. I want this moment to last forever. Oh my Prince. 
Thank you. You came for me, even though it wasn&#39;t what you were here 
for. You came for me, even though your quest for humanity was damned. 
Damned from the beginning. They would have taken me away anyway. I can 
do nothing but cling to you and sob. So much to tell you, so little 
time. I can tell you are here to kill. To kill Him. But I still know 
you came for me first.

Oh my Prince, I have loved you before you were Born.</pre>
