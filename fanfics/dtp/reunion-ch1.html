<h1>Reunion: A Dominion Tank Police Adventure</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dtp/index.html">Dominion Tank Police</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Leona sighed happily as she coasted her motorcycle to a stop, the purr 
of the engine easing off beautifully. The black haired young woman 
looked crisp and neat in her tank police uniform, only a bit mussed by 
her wild ride. Slinging her bag over her shoulder she strode inside, 
detouring intentionally to her favorite place.

The tanks waited in their bays for the start of the day&#146;s duties, each 
one of the small but powerful craft carefully tended to the night before 
by the maintenance staff. With unerring instinct she made her way to her 
own tank, laying her hand on the metal shell fondly, &#147;Good morning, 
Bonaparte.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure that she treats the tank better than she does us,&#148; one voice 
complained.

&#147;It&#146;s not like it has soft curves or can be snuggled,&#148; the other added.

&#147;It&#146;s barely even cute,&#148; another mutter.

&#147;Anna, Uni,&#148; Leona turned to glare at them, a dangerous glitter in her 
eyes as she took in the two beautiful blondes who had followed her 
inside from their usual perch in her new sidecar. The twins were nearly 
a foot taller than she was, busty where she was flat chested and 
terribly sexy in a feline sort of way.

&#147;Uh oh, she&#146;s pissed,&#148; Uni blinked.

&#147;It&#146;s not my fault,&#148; Anna ducked behind Uni.

Leona&#146;s eyes glittered dangerously, &#147;I seem to recall Anna having a 
great time firing Bonaparte&#146;s cannons yesterday.&#148; She frowned, &#147;An 
officer&#146;s tank is his closest ally and best friend, you two should know 
that by now.&#148;

&#147;Yes ma&#146;am,&#148; both Anna and Uni chorused.

Leona sighed, feeling a throbbing headache coming on. Before she could 
react Anna slid up to one side of her, Uni on the other as both looked 
down at her fondly. &#147;Hey, I...&#148; Leona started to say.

&#147;We&#146;ll make it up to you later, sempai,&#148; Anna purred seductively, 
rubbing her body up against Leona gracefully.

&#147;We even got new costumes to wear for you, too,&#148; Uni added impishly.

&#147;Back off, you two,&#148; the fiercely blushing Leona managed to say, 
wiggling out from between the two girls. Clearing her throat once she 
was clear she added, &#147;Come on, we&#146;ve got to get to work.&#148;

&#147;Yes,&#148; both Anna and Uni said in singsong voices. Anna and Uni had been 
living with Leona for the past few months, and she was still adapting to 
that, not to mention their both recently becoming her lovers. She could 
feel the eyes of her fellow officers resting on them as they strode 
through headquarters and often found herself wondering what they really 
thought of the situation.

Brenten smiled as they passed, the black haired, muscular man smiling 
slightly to himself. &#147;Think she knows?&#148; he asked the others softly.

Specs shook his head, his trademark round glasses gleaming, &#147;I doubt 
she&#146;s be so unconcerned, otherwise.&#148;

&#147;Know what?&#148; Leona backtracked to look at both of them with dangerous 
intensity. Despite being smaller than the powerfully muscled Brenten she 
stood up to him easily, her confidence making up for the difference 
easily.

&#147;There&#146;s a new inspector,&#148; Specs offered, &#147; who&#146;s looking into 
efficiency of the tank service. I understand he&#146;ll be visiting here.&#148;

&#147;So that&#146;s why you two are worried,&#148; Leona realized.

&#147;Wonder if we should do to this inspector what we did to the last one?&#148; 
Uni asked impishly.

Anna smirked, &#147;She didn&#146;t know what hit her.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t even think about it,&#148; Leona turned on the catgirls and hustled 
them towards where the squad waited. &#147;Besides,&#148; she added irritably, 
&#147;the station was getting love sick phone calls for weeks afterwards.&#148;

&#147;We are good,&#148; Uni nodded with a wicked smile.

&#147;Maybe, but now you&#146;re mine,&#148; Leona said with a much gentler tone.

As they reached their squad&#146;s cluster of desks Habana looked up from his 
paperwork, the wheelchair bound driver nodding his greetings. Shinozaki 
sat stiffly, the tall young man looking like a police recruitment 
poster, while his opposite Shimizu lounged nearby, the university 
graduate calmly waiting out his next rotation. Finally Asada smiled in 
greeting, the light brown haired woman as good natured as usual.

&#147;Habana, report,&#148; Leona said as she dropped into her seat.

&#147;We&#146;re on standby today after last night&#146;s run in with the gangbangers,&#148; 
Habana answered crisply, &#147;and according to office scuttlebutt there&#146;s a 
inspector on his way today.&#148;

&#147;Any trouble from the Osaka police over our nailing them here?&#148;Leona 
asked, remembering the motorcycle cops they had assisted in the bust.

&#147;They&#146;d rather have got them on their territory,&#148; Asada said with a 
shrug, &#147;but I think they were glad to see those punks go down one way or 
the other.&#148;

&#147;Fair enough,&#148; Leona tossed the papers she was flipping through on the 
desk. &#147;I&#146;ll go to inspection, and keep an eye out for the inspector. If 
he&#146;s just a headquarters drone he may not know anything about operating 
a tanks.&#148;

&#147;Oh,&#148; the quiet voice said from nearby, &#147;I think I know my way around a 
tank.&#148;

Cursing her inattention Leona whirled around... then froze in surprise. 
The sandy haired young man was a bit older than she was, a small smile 
curling up his lips, and he wore the uniform of a lieutenant. &#147;Al?&#148; 
Leona breathed out.

&#147;It&#146;s been awhile,&#148; Al smiled back warmly.

Like a shot Leona was out of her chair and quickly had Al in a headlock. 
&#147;Don&#146;t you try being cool with me!&#148; Leona growled, &#147;Wha&#146; the hell were 
you doing, just disappearing like that! Why I ought to...&#148;

&#147;Is she really supposed to be beating up the inspector like that?&#148; 
Shinozaki asked nervously as Leona began to noogie Al.

&#147;Don&#146;t be too worried about it,&#148; Habana offered, &#147;I understand he was 
Leona&#146;s first driver, way back when.&#148;

&#147;How long ago was that?&#148; Asada smirked.

&#147;Don&#146;t let Leona hear you say that,&#148; Shimizu said dryly.

Leona hurried back to the squad with a bounce to her step. &#147;The 
inspector,&#148; she said to them wryly, &#147;needs to talk to me, so Habana, you 
get the fun of inspection. Everyone else, to you jobs!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t like this,&#148; Uni said as Al and Leona walked off.

&#147;Me, either,&#148; Anna frowned.

&#147;Damn it&#146;s been a long time,&#148; Leona said as they walked by the tanks 
then out into the sunlight, the street outside busy with people and 
vehicles.

&#147;I am sorry I didn&#146;t stay in touch,&#148; Al said quietly, &#147;I went back to 
college for a while, then bounced around various units.&#148;

&#147;We have a college guy here, too,&#148; Leona thought wryly of Shimizu, who 
was on a fast track to promotion but didn&#146;t seem to really care much 
about police work. They moved away from the doors towards some greenery, 
the plants struggling to survive under the shadows of several larger 
bushes.

Al looked up to the sky as he confessed, &#147;That, and our last talk kind 
of kept me away.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Al,&#148; Leona reached out to put her hand on his arm. Shortly 
before Al left the tank police he had confessed his love to Leona... who 
had, in all honesty, never noticed it. It had been hideously awkward for 
both of them, so she could understand his staying away.

&#147;Not your fault,&#148; Al sighed, &#147;attraction is a funny thing, especially if 
it&#146;s just one way.&#148;

&#147;Still,&#148; Leona shrugged, &#147;I kind of wish I had been a bit more 
perceptive.&#148;

&#147;Well, if the rumors are right I at least know why,&#148; Al smiled suddenly, 
giving Leona a impish look. &#147;Or are the stories about you and the twins 
false?&#148;

Leona actually blushed, &#147;No, they&#146;re true.&#148;

Al looked over at her fondly. &#147;I guess I just wanted to say that there&#146;s 
no hard feelings,&#148; he said a bit awkwardly, &#147;and I wish you the best.&#148;

&#147;WHAT!&#148; Anna burst out of the bush she was hiding in. &#147;That&#146;s it?&#148;

Uni tumbled out of the bush after her to sprawl at Al and Leona&#146;s feet. 
&#147;Damn, and we were hoping for something really juicy, too,&#148; she 
complained.

&#147;You were spying on us!&#148; Leona growled.

&#147;Uh oh, she&#146;s pissed,&#148; Anna gulped then she and Uni bolted as fast as 
they could, Leona in hot pursuit.

&#147;Get back here you two clockwork ditz!&#148; Leona roared.

&#147;Nice to see this place doesn&#146;t change much,&#148; Al said with a smile as he 
watched Leona pelting them with rubber bullets.

End

Notes: In the original Dominion manga and OVA, Al is a major character 
who spends a LOT of time quietly wishing Leona would notice him, but he 
disappears before the second manga, Dominion: Conflict, begins. This is 
my attempt to explain his absence, more or less, as well as touch on 
what happened to him after the first series.</pre>
