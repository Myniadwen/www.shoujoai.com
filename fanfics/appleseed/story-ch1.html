<pre>My life is good.

I have a good job fighting crime, have an understanding colleagues, 
and most importantly of all, I&#39;m with the one I love.

It just doesn&#39;t get much better than this.

Oh, where are my manners?  I should have introduced myself first.  I&#39;m 
Deunan Knute.  Welcome to my -- excuse me -- OUR place.

This is where we live.  Just the 3 of us.  It&#39;s a sweet arrangement, 
if I do say so myself.

My best friend has a private room.  My beloved and I have a room.

I still find it soo hard to believe.  Just a few years ago, if anyone 
had said that I would be this happy, I would have said that they were 
crazy.  I was still in the &quot;Badlands&quot; at the time.  That was when it 
all began.  That was I met not only my best friend, but the love of my 
life as well.  That was when I met -- 

&quot;Hey, Deunan.  What are you up to?&quot;  Someone asks.

&quot;Oh, nothing.  Just writing in my memoirs.&quot;  I answer.

Then someone enters my room.

I look up from my writing, then sigh quietly.  It was my best friend, 
Briareos Hecatonchries.  I just smile at him.  &quot;So, what&#39;s new?  Are 
we on duty... again?&quot;

He just chuckles.  &quot;When are we ever NOT on duty?  No, I wanted to 
know, what&#39;s for dinner tonight?&quot;

I answer.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Surprise me.&quot;

He replies, &quot;Okay.  Oh, what are you writing about this time?&quot;

I say, &quot;I&#39;ll show you later.&quot;

He says, &quot;Okay, I guess I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;, then he leaves.

I just smile.  Yes, life is good.  Now, where was I?  I look down at 
my memoirs, and resume writing.

That was I met the people who would become my lifesavers.  First, my 
first, and best friend, Briareos.

Together, we managed to survive the nightmare world that was the 
&quot;Badlands&quot;.  To this day, I really don&#39;t know how we stayed alive 
until now.  And, quite frankly, I&#39;m not sure I really want to know.  
But, enough about that.

The other one would eventually become my beloved.  When we first met, 
I thought it was an angel.  How else could someone else have saved us 
from that place, and bring us into the paradise of Olympia?

I was in awe at first sight, and I&#39;m still in awe now.

Right now, you&#39;re probably wondering who my beloved is.  Well, I can&#39;t 
blame you there.

Well, I&#39;ll tell you this.  Despite what you may have heard at the 
police station where we work, it is NOT Briareos.  Besides, I prefer 
women.  It is --

&quot;Hey Deunan.  Where are you?&quot;

I hear it.  The one voice that still captures my heart, even now.

&quot;Deu-chan, where are you?&quot;

I just smile, and keep writing.

&quot;Hey, Briareos-kun.  Have you seen Deu-chan?&quot;  She asks.

&quot;Try your room.  The last time I saw her, she was writing her 
memoirs.&quot;  He replies in a slightly joking tone.

&quot;Okay, thank you.&quot;  She says, then heads for our room.

I&#39;m still writing, when --

&quot;Hey, Deu-chan!  How are you?&quot;

I look up, and close the book I was writing in.  This way, I could 
give her my full attention.

She looks at me, and asks, &quot;May I come in?&quot;

I smile and say, &quot;Of course!&quot;  I walk toward her.

We go into each other&#39;s arms and embrace lovingly.

She looks at me, and says, &quot;My Deu-chan.&quot;

I answer, &quot;My beloved Hitomi-koi.&quot;
