<h1>If I Can't Be Yours (part 9 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rocketbabe.html">RocketBabe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Once her song was finished, Maya made her way back over to their booth 
and in her haste to return she stumbled a little but managed to regain 
her balance with a minimum of embarrassment, though she did get her left 
buttock pinched by a middle aged businessman on her way back but rather 
than blushing, she turned around and winked at him, sashaying her hips a 
little. Unfortunately her slightly staggering gait betrayed her attempt 
at seductiveness. She barely even blushed when she saw Ritsuko.

&quot;That was wonderful Maya, you&#39;re really talented!&quot; That raised a red hue 
in Maya&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Thanks Dr Akagi.&quot; She smiled slightly, almost flirtatiously.

&quot;Please, it&#39;s Ritsuko!&quot; She turned back to Misato upon feeling a nudge 
in the ribs and had to bite her tongue to keep herself from laughing. A 
young man who looked to be barely over the legal drinking age, quite 
obviously drunk and suffering from an over-inflated ego, was trying to 
put the moves on Misato and failing miserably.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you DO have the biggest cock of all the men in here like you 
claim, but I&#39;m afraid I like girls.&quot; She smiled condescendingly at him 
as she placed a hand on Ritsuko&#39;s thigh. &quot;And I don&#39;t think my 
girlfriend here would be very happy with you trying to chat me up whilst 
she&#39;s within earshot.&quot; Still trying not to laugh, Ritsuko placed an arm 
around Misato&#39;s shoulder and kissed her cheek.

&quot;Is this dick giving you trouble, sweetie?&quot; She played with a lock of 
Misato&#39;s hair whilst shooting contemptuous glares at her would-be 
suitor. Unfortunately Misato&#39;s claim of homosexuality hadn&#39;t deterred 
him as much as she had hoped.

&quot;Rug munchers eh? I bet you both just need a good, hard fuck from a guy 
like me to win you back from the dark side.&quot; He raised an eyebrow 
suggestively at Ritsuko. &quot;How about you let me show you both how good 
guys can be.&quot; Misato managed to keep a straight face and reply airily.

&quot;No, we&#39;re perfectly happy with each other thankyou all the same. We 
don&#39;t want or need a man, but hey, if we change our minds.&quot; She winked 
at him. He was beginning to show signs of defeat but still wasn&#39;t 
prepared to go out without a fight.

&quot;So you two really are lovers? Prove it. I wanna see you kiss each 
other.&quot; Ritsuko nuzzled at Misato&#39;s neck, managing to look deadly 
serious.

&quot;Will it make the weird hetero go away?&quot; Misato nodded.

&quot;I think so.&quot; Ritsuko allowed Misato to initiate their kiss. She was 
surprised by how much she enjoyed it and they both got fairly heavily 
into it, caressing each other&#39;s legs and breasts, carrying on for over a 
minute. The young man said nothing more but his gaping mouth and 
suspiciously bulging trousers gave them more than enough information as 
he slowly departed, casting a disbelieving glance back at them every 
couple of seconds. Once he was safely out of range, the pair of them 
burst out laughing.

&quot;Did you see the look on his face? He&#39;s going to be having sweet dreams 
tonight!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s for damn sure, dammit you were good, &#39;will it make the weird 
hetero go away&#39; I thought I was gonna giggle and blow the whole thing! 
Aw, you don&#39;t think I was too hard on him do ya? He was only a kid.&quot; 
Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. &quot;Nah, I didn&#39;t think ya would. Thanks for 
doing that though, it&#39;s been a while since we had to do that to get rid 
of a creep like him.&quot;

&quot;Mmmhmm, if I recall correctly last time we tried that Kaji was just 
more insistent than ever that he was going to win you over. But I guess 
there&#39;s no accounting for taste.&quot; Misato glared at her. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m 
kidding. How about some more margueritas? On me this time, but you can 
go and get them, they always serve the slutty ones first.&quot; They both 
laughed.

&quot;Oh, if I was sober you would be SO dead!&quot; Misato climbed over her to 
get out of the booth with a distinct lack of dignity, giving Hyuga an 
image of fan service he wasn&#39;t going to forget for a long time. Ritsuko 
hoped for Misato&#39;s sake that she was wearing underwear with a skirt that 
short. As she watched Misato go, Maya was made conspicuous by her 
absence.

&quot;Where did Ibuki-chan go?&quot; She hiccupped and Aoba shrugged.

&quot;Said she was going for some air, she only left about a minute ago.&quot; 
Something seemed to occur to Shigeru. He gave Ritsuko a very odd, almost 
searching look as he stood up. &quot;I&#39;m going to go and see how she is.&quot; He 
headed out of the bar. A look of concern played across Ritsuko&#39;s face. 
Hyuga gestured after them with his head/

&quot;Guess some people just can&#39;t hold their liquor like us, huh?&quot; She gave 
him a false smile.

&quot;I guess not.&quot; ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;Maya?&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;I just wanted to see how you are, you left pretty quickly then, just 
checking you&#39;re not throwing up or anything.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, I&#39;ll be back inside in a minute.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re crying.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s just very smoky in there. Leave me, please, I&#39;m fine.&quot; There 
was a pause. The young man sat down on the curb next to her. &quot;I said I&#39;m 
okay, I&#39;ll go back inside in a second.&quot;

&quot;You like her, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Ritsuko.&quot; Maya said nothing. He sighed at her silence. &quot;Look, it&#39;s just 
an educated guess, and I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m wro-&quot;

&quot;What made you think so?&quot; He smiled vaguely.

&quot;I saw you looking at her in there, it&#39;s not hard to recognise adoration 
like that, then when she kissed Misato, that was pure envy in your 
eyes.&quot; Maya seemed to take offence at this but before she could object, 
he continued. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I think we&#39;ve all had it like that for someone 
at some point, but it hurts, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Maya turned her face away from 
him, impressed at his perceptive power but unsettled by the accuracy of 
his observations. They sat in silence for a while, until she turned back 
to him once more.

&quot;Does anyone else know?&quot; He shook his head.

&quot;Hyuga is the only one in with a chance of guessing and he couldn&#39;t pick 
up on something like this after three beers if he had training. I only 
just guessed myself.&quot; He allowed a few seconds to elapse. &quot;So are you 
going to tell her?&quot; Maya stared at him as if he&#39;d just suggested she 
take Ritsuko&#39;s life.

&quot;Are you insane? How the hell would she react to that, do you want me to 
get fired?&quot; Aoba shrugged.

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t fire you for telling her this, what do you have to lose 
after all? It&#39;s not like she&#39;s your best friend or anything.&quot;

&quot;What do I have to lose? What do I have to fucking lose? How about the 
respect of everybody who finds out? How well do you think that would go 
down with her, what it would do to my reputation?&quot;

&quot;Maya, calm down, I&#39;m sorry OK, but this isn-&quot;

&quot;Calm down?&quot; She had now risen to her feet as she yelled at him. &quot;Do you 
have any idea how hard this is for me? I&#39;m living under her roof for 
God&#39;s sake, do you really think she&#39;d keep me as a house guest if she 
found out how disgusting and sick I am?&quot;

&quot;Maya, Dr Akagi wouldn&#39;t judge you for something like this, I&#39;m sure 
she&#39;s not like that, and what if she has feelings like this too?&quot; She 
laughed hysterically at his idealistic suggestion.

&quot;Yes, because life really is that fair, Shigeru. Maybe in your fairytale 
pansy little world everything works out like that and boys love boys and 
girls love girls and everything is fine, but my life isn&#39;t like that, 
God knows that I wish it was, do you know how hard it&#39;s been for me? Do 
you have any idea what I gave up to be with my last girlfriend when I 
found out the way I was, how important that was to me, and how I stayed 
with her, when it all went sour because I didn&#39;t want to lose that 
security, the feeling of loving someone and having a roof over my hea-&quot;

&quot;Maya! Stop this, you&#39;re drunk and you&#39;ll onl-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me to shut up!&quot; She was now sobbing hysterically, though her 
voice was not as loud. &quot;You have no idea what it&#39;s like for me right 
now, how hard it is to see her with another woman. Ritsuko will never 
know what I feel, because it&#39;s wrong, my parents were right to throw me 
out, girls shouldn&#39;t love girls. Yoshimi tried to teach me otherwise and 
what happened? She kicked me out too, I lost that, and I can&#39;t put my 
feelings on the line like that again, I love her too much to risk being 
rejected by her as well and yes it hurts, it can be agony at times but 
we all have crosses to bear. I can hide this, I can keep my feelings at 
bay and I would much rather have to live with that than have Ritsuko 
hate me for being some screwed up dyke who&#39;s bordering on obsessed with 
her. Dammit Aoba, she&#39;s all I can think about and you can&#39;t sit there 
and tell me she&#39;s going to take that well. She doesn&#39;t deserve all my 
bullshit, and she could do so much better than me anyway.&quot; She finished, 
sobbing convulsively, but Aoba was no longer looking at her, he was 
staring at the doorway of the bar behind her with an extremely odd 
expression, almost half wincing, half nauseated. Maya shook her head and 
whispered, almost inaudibly &quot;No, she&#39;s not, please, she can&#39;t be.&quot; She 
turned around, as if she didn&#39;t know what she would see there, and was 
met with a pair of very familiar, very shocked, green eyes. &quot;Shit.&quot;</pre>
