<h1>Altered Destinies (part 8 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Gendo Ikari looked off into the distance, the black
haired man&#39;s expression troubled. &quot;The scrolls
predicted a certain order in the arrival of the
angels,&quot; he murmured softly, &quot;but strangely, that
hasn&#39;t happened.&quot;

Fuyutsuki raised his eyebrows, the older man looking
oddly dignified as he stood by Gendo&#39;s desk, the floor
beneath them covered by odd symbols. &quot;Which means?&quot; he
asked, curious about how the man was analysing the
situation.

Gendo frowned, &quot;It seems that SEELE can no longer rely
on the scrolls to guide mankind&#39;s destiny.&quot; A faint
smile, &quot;It must have come as quite a shock.&quot;

Fuyutsuki nodded agreement, &quot;Will this effect our
plans?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll continue with our efforts to achieve
Instrumentality, of course,&quot; Gendo said confidently,
&quot;but we have to be prepared for the unexpected, too. I
want to move up the arrival of EVA-03 and we need our
allies to work harder to prepare the other Evangelion
Units.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Fuyutsuki made a note. He hesitated, &quot;Do
we know why the Scrolls are no longer accurate?&quot;

Gendo looked off into the distance for a moment, his
glasses gleaming. &quot;I looked at some of the
translations, including the battles against the
Angels,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;they mention a boy who&#39;s
purpose is to battle them.&quot;

&quot;So we need to recruit a male pilot?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Gendo shook his head with a faint smile, &quot;I
think they were talking about Shinji.&quot;

Fuyutsuki looked at him in confusion, &quot;But she&#39;s a...
I mean, that can&#39;t be right.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s the first difference between the
scrolls and reality,&quot; Gendo said frankly, &quot;and I
suspect that it won&#39;t be the last.&quot;

In another part of the complex Shinji Ikari sat in the
simulator, her expression faintly amused as she
squeezed off another round of bullets. The simulated
Angel disappeared and shje moved on even as she said,
&quot;So what&#39;s next?&quot;

Ritsuko Akagio smiled from where she stood I the
control room, her white labcoat swirling around her
legs. The blonde took out a ten hundred yen note and
passed it over to Misato, &quot;Looks like you win our
bet.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Misato smirked as the black haired woman
purred, &quot;I told you she&#39;d do well in the simulator.&quot;

&quot;Keep in mind your rearming points,&quot; Ritsuko reminded
her, &quot;the locations in the city where you can replace
your rifle are also echoed in the simulation.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Shinji nodded as she made her Evangelion
sweep the city, also keeping an eye on her weapon&#39;s
readouts.Another Angel popperd up and she dropped and
rolled, coming up in firing position only to be nearly
struck by a tentacle.

&quot;That was close,&quot; Misato winced as Shinji nimbly
jumped her Evangelion back, spraying the Angel with
simulated bullets.

&quot;Nice to see our prodigy isn&#39;t perfect,&quot; Ritsuki
commented mildly. Talking to Shinji she said, &quot;Also
try to remember that the Angels aren&#39;t limited to a
humanoid form, they could come in all shapes and
sizes.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Shinji said with a flash of irritation, her
eyes narrowed with annoyance as she proceded to kill
the Angel with extra bullets.

Ritsuko grinned as she murmured to Misato, &quot;She does
have a temper.&quot;

Behind Ritsuko and Misato the door swished open and a
figure entered the room, watching the screen with
thoughtful red eyes. Rei Ayanami&#39;s light blue hair
fell into her eyes, her school uniform swirling around
her legs.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Misato looked a bit surprised to see her there
as she asked, &quot;did you have a simulator session
booked?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rei shook her head slightly, her eyes moving to
watch the black haired young woman up on the screen.
&quot;How is Shinji doing?&quot; she asked in her soft way.

Misato and Ritsuko exchanged faintly surprised
glances, knowing that Rei&#39;s interest was unusual to
say the least. &quot;She&#39;s doing quite well,&quot; Ritsuko
answered her mildly, &quot;though Shinji&#39;s not quite at
your level, yet.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Rei nodded slightly then without a word turned
and left the room.

&quot;Well that was odd,&quot; Misato blinked.

Ritsuko shook her head, wondering what was going on
with the enigmatic young woman. Not that understanding
Rei was easy at the best of times, but she seemed even
more mysterious around Shinji. &quot;Think Rei likes her?&quot;
Ritsuko asked as they watched Shinji fight.

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Misato put her hands in the pockets of her
jacket, &quot;she seems more... interested, when Shinji&#39;s
around.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Ritsuko nnodded, having observed that in the
two girl&#39;s interactions. &quot;Oh, you&#39;d better get your
good dress out,&quot; she said to Misato.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Misato looked confused by the change of topic.

&quot;You did remember the wedding we&#39;re going to?&quot; Ritsuko
reminded her. A chuckle, &quot;Yet another of our friends
is getting married.&quot;

&quot;What is it with them?&quot; Misato shook her head with
amusement, &quot;They&#39;re rushing to the altar like lemmigs
to the sea.&quot;

&quot;Now there&#39;s a vivid thought, m&#39;love, &quot; Ritsuko
laughed softly at that. Turning around to see Shinji
in pitched battle with yet another Angel she asked
her, &quot;Do you want to keep going or pack it in for the
rest of the day?&quot;

&quot;Just let me finish this,&quot; and Shinji ducked a blow,
her rifle blazing at nearly point blank range to
destroy her opponent.

A few moments later and Shinji had changed out of her
blue plugsuit into a girl&#39;s school uniform, today.
Oddly she wore both the boy&#39;s and girl&#39;s uniforms to
class, a unique gesture that the staff hadn&#39;t objected
to so far. It fit the girl&#39;s personality in some ways,
being so mild mannered most of the time but fierce
battling the Angels.

&#39;Or dealing with Gendo,&#39; Ritsuko noted. Aloud she
said, &quot;How would you like to join Misato on an
excursion, Shin-chan?&quot;

&quot;What sort of excursion?&quot; Shinji asked, putting her
school bag over her shoulder casually as they walked
to a lift to the surface.

&quot;The Evangelion Unit-02 is on it&#39;s way here,&quot; Misato
explained, &quot;we&#39;re transportig it and it&#39;s pilot here
by sea. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be going out via helecopter to
meet them.&quot;

&quot;The pilot,&quot; Shinji tried to remember, &quot;that&#39;s Asuka,
right?&quot;

Ritsuko nodded, &quot;Asuka Soryu Langley, correct. She&#39;s
something of a prodigy, too, as well as arguably a
genius.&quot;

&quot;Have you met her?&quot; Misato looked curiously towards
Ritsuko, &quot;So far, I&#39;ve only seen a photograph and her
files.&quot;

&quot;Once, I interviewed her for Gendo,&quot; Ritsuko said. She
looked over at Shinji, &quot;So what do you think?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go, as long as I get to miss school,&quot; Shinji
grinned impishly.

Misato laughed at that, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll have to.&quot; She
looked thoughtful, &quot;You could even invite your
classmates along.&quot;

Shinji thought of the crush Aida still had I her and
winced. &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; she said, &quot;this is
Nerv business, after all.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Ritsuko looked amused. She hesitated and
added, &quot;Hmm, I wonder if Rei Ayanami would want to go
along?&quot;

Misato blinked, &quot;Not a bad idea, but Gendo might
disapprove of our having all three pilots away from
here.&quot;

&quot;Still, it can&#39;t hurt to ask,&quot; Ritsuko nodded.

Shinji had a faint blush to her cheeks but she kept
her voice even, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;</pre>
