<h1>A Simple Girl's Silence (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ancientrime.html">Ancient Rime</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/sgsilence-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Ryoji Kaji was known for being a man of his own wishes. There was no 
trappings in the world that could bind his free spirit. When he felt 
that something needed to be done, it was made so. Despite the way that 
many viewed him, he was a good man who would rather die than choose 
the path to wrong. It had to be so, for there was no other 
explaination for his actions, that would so certainly cause him death. 
Yes, Kaji was truly willing to risk it all for the woman that he 
loved. He wanted her to know the real truth, and he was tired of the 
covert ways of the life of a spy. 

One could not tell whether it was day or night at the present. Rooms 
like these were never graced with the light of day, SEELE and the 
Japanese government made absolutely sure of that. Three rooms of this 
sort housed all of SEELE&#39;s main data base. Within the compiled memory 
of these computers sat the real truth of NERV. All secrets seemed to 
stream from the mouths of men in the form of but subtle whispers had 
end up here in this vast ocean of knowledge. Kaji sat there at the 
keyboard, the screen reflecting in his eyes. There was a picture of 
Rei, the first child. The documentation on the research on Lillith sat 
staring him right in the face, NERV was naked before him. 

The cursor blinked in the open window. The the paths that lay before 
him were made clear &quot;save this file to disk? Yes/No.&quot; He withdrew one 
deep breath, which might be his last as he cognizantly moved the 
cursor over the &quot;Yes&quot; option, and right clicked. One more thing was 
left, he had attached a second small file to the CD, typing only a few 
lines. With a soft sigh, he opened the D drive and removed the CD. It 
was done now... This CD contained the entire truth of Rei&#39;s existance, 
and all that the girl ever wanted to know. And now for the woman he 
loved, Misato, she too would share in this discovery.

&quot;Hmph... And now for the final touches.&quot; He pulled a pen from his 
pocket, and clicked the top. It was so silent that the clicking could 
be heard for miles. On a small post-it, he wrote his final words, 
knowing that this would be his last.

Misato,
This is the very last of my existance, I ask that you put me to good 
use. Contained within this CD are the answers to all of your 
questions. It&#39;s going to be OK. And as for Rei, I can only hope that 
she comes to terms with her real truth. If I ever see you again, I 
promise I&#39;ll tell you the three words that I have withheld for so 
long.
Love Eternally,
Kaji

The silence was overwhelming, but Kaji found the strength to leave the 
rolling chair where he had been seated and make his way out the door. 
Most would stop to look over their shoulder after having done as he 
had, but Kaji seemed to walk along as though nothing had happened at 
all. How typical of that man, accepting his fate instead of running 
from it. The sky was an unusual shade of dim gray today, as though God 
himself were in his heaven and pensive with thought. He wasn&#39;t far off 
from his final destination now. After a showrt car ride, he had 
arrived at the apartment complex where Misato was living with Shinji. 
The journey up the stairs seemed to never end, as though that stair 
case was ascending into heaven. But there he was, at Misato&#39;s door. He 
was so sure that she wasn&#39;t home, because that beautiful laughter 
couldn&#39;t be heard anywhere. As a matter of fact, the apartments were 
oddly silent today. She simply smiled, slipping a white square object 
inside the box.

He stood there a moment more, until he felt something cold pressed up 
against the area where the base of his neck met his skull. Kaji didn&#39;t 
say a word, he didn&#39;t even turn around. Before he could do anything, 
that confident gruff voice came the all clear. 

&quot;You thought you could get away with this... Did you Kaji? Did you 
think that I wasn&#39;t watching you?&quot; 

The half light of the hall way concealed the commander&#39;s contempt and 
anger. Fuyutsuki had not trusted Kaji from day one. He had forever 
questioned Commander Ikari as to how wise it was to have him around 
even if it was only for the sole purpose of using him. Fuyutsuki&#39;s 
suspicions had been confirmed as of now, the conviction of his solid 
will was thus burried against Kaji&#39;s neck in the form of a cold steel 
barrel. The noble voice of the professor could be discerned from all 
others, and in the present was unspeakably grim.

&quot;This wasn&#39;t part of NERV&#39;s dealings with you. I regret having to kill 
you, but I must do the correct thing by Commander Ikari. Don&#39;t curse 
him when you end up in hell, dear friend. This was personal.&quot;

There was barely a sound heard as the silenced gun went off, piercing 
through Kaji&#39;s neck. That silence shot, it seemed so final. The only 
other sound heard was the light clank of the CD hitting the floor. He 
didn&#39;t fall to the floor, Fuyutsuki had managed to catch him before a 
sound could be heard. After having taken Kaji up, she smashed the CD 
into small shards. It was only a simple matter of disposing of the 
body now, which Fuyutsuki did quite secretly.

All hope seemed to be lost, but there in Misato&#39;s mail box sat the 
ultimate truth, with Kaji&#39;s last words and very blood upon it. It was 
all in Misato&#39;s hands now, only she could discover the truth. Kaji had 
done it for Misato, but he had also given his life for Rei; may the 
truth be forever known. It wasn&#39;t long at all before Misato got home. 
She stepped inside the appartment and had a drink first and foremost, 
and then went to check her mail. She uncovered several new bills and a 
CD in a white slip case. She decided to save the CD for last, assuming 
that it was Shinji&#39;s grades.

Misato Katsuragi was not the most virtuous of all women; certainly she 
had her own tragic flaws. Tragedy, the dictionary defines it as a 
disasterous event, a misfortune. Misato was still a child in many 
ways, most often in the way that she sometimes found her self placing 
the blame on others rather than falling into self loathing. More so 
than often, however, Misato had begun to realize that the apex of 
human iniquity was not brought about by outside forces, but by the 
will of man himself. 

She felt terribly guily for what had happened to Asuka. She would have 
felt just the same no matter who the pilot had been, unless it had 
been Rei. Misato further investigated her peculiar detachment from 
Rei. Looking back at it, she slowly began to realize that no one 
seemed to be able to form a bond with Rei, except perhaps for 
Commander Ikari. It was assumed that a bond had formed between her and 
Asuka since she was so easily able to sync with Unit 02. But, Misato 
had not seen any solid concrete proof of this. 

Come to think of it, no one really knew anything about Rei to Misato&#39;s 
knowledge. She was bored now, and had begun to wonder why Shinji 
wasn&#39;t already home. In her boredom, her eyes idly wondered over to 
the CD in its case. Whatever could be on it? It was sort of early for 
Class A&#39;s grades to be in already. She got to her feet and took the CD 
in her hand pulling it out of its case. Sitting at the computer desk, 
she ejected the drawer to the CD rom. The disk loaded, and her 
complete shock registered with it as she began to read into the text. 
Kaji&#39;s message was there for her to read at the very end. Unlike the 
decoy, it had been added in a small file on the real CD.

Misato held her head and instantly began to cry. Slowly dropping to 
her kees, weeping bitterly, she covered her eyes, those tears seeping 
through. 

&quot;You S... stupid jerk... How could you... waste it all. HOW COULD 
YOU?! How could you waste your whole life so.. carelessly&quot; 

Misato&#39;s heart had gone and died with the man that she loved, and she 
probably would never recover from the loss. Her words were muffled and 
staggered though her heart felt sobs. But what was there to be done? 
Could she just go and disolve the only hope that mankind had left? 
Misato didn&#39;t want to destroy hope for the futer, but there had to be 
something to do with what she had been given; indeed she had to been 
obligated to it. it was an inalienable fact, the only right thing 
could be for Rei Ayanami to learn the truth.

Rei sat in the corner again for this gym period. Her physics book 
remain opened and spread out on her lap. 

&quot;And because of De Broglie&#39;s extensive research, it was concluded that 
Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity and Planck&#39;s Equation could be 
combined to enable him to predict the wave wavelength of a particle of 
mass and velocity. Heisenberg later concluded that that this was 
impossible. For everything you study, you also run the risk that it 
has changed via experimatation.&quot;

She lifted her head up from the text book. Reflecting on Heisenberg&#39;s 
Principle, Rei began to wonder to herself. Do we really know anything 
at all? She missed Asuka. Rei never thought that she would live to see 
the day, but that day had come. This love that she felt for Asuka, she 
wasn&#39;t going to ignore it. It had been there the whole while; Asuka 
had simply been trying to help her learn who she was in her quest to 
know Rei herself, and yet Rei had closed her mind for so long. 

&quot;Uncertainty&quot; she thought to herself quietly. &quot;This must be what 
breeds such fear in the hearts of human beings. Is this why it hurts 
so much, what I feel for her? It&#39;s because I am uncertain not of these 
feelings, but of who I am myself... There must be a way, a way around 
uncertainty&quot; 

And now, it was probably too late. Asuka was still in the hospital. 
That party that they were to go to, it was only a day away now. Asuka 
had been looking forward to it, but she would probably never be able 
to attend it now. 

Rei&#39;s lips moved almost without her even knowing it. 

&quot;Asuka Langley Soryu. If you die now, the truth will die with you. I 
love ... you.&quot; 

She herself could not believe that she had just said what she had. 
Considering a principle of uncertainty, Rei had certainly said 
something that she was very sure of, and without the aid of evidence. 
Rei was unaware that she was not the only one who was wrecked over the 
grief of tragedy. Lost in her thoughts, she closed her book, and 
tucked it into her book bag. She had begun walking off the school 
grounds when she had run into Misato. 

Misato could not believe that she had run into Rei so easily, as if it 
had been brought about by fate. She tried her best to keep a look on 
her face that would suggest that the pain in her eyes was not present 
at all. A smile spread across her face as Rei stood there still, 
without so much as a word waiting for Misato to speak first. 
&quot;Rei... I have been looking for you.&quot; Rei still looked down, but she 
did answer Misato.

&quot;What for?&quot;

Misato choked back the tears in her throat, and reminded herself that 
she had a prupose in finding Rei.

&quot;There&#39;s something that I need to talk to you about, something that 
you have to see.&quot;

Rei showed no emotion in her eyes, once again retreating behind the 
veil of apathy.

&quot;Why?&quot; 

Her amber eye stared softly down at the pavement beneath her feet, as 
though she felt that if she should take her eyes away from it, that it 
would fail to exist at all, and she would be whisked away into the 
worries of her self-doubt. Misato knelt, so that Rei would be forced 
to look at her in some way shape or form.

&quot;I am asking you as a friend, that you please come with me. There is 
something that I have to share with you, because it&#39;s the only right 
thing left for me to do. Please don&#39;t deny me that. I&#39;m not so blind 
as I pretend to be Rei. I&#39;m old enough to know that you have to 
venture down the path that you can&#39;t see clearly, because that&#39;s the 
only true way. That&#39;s the only true path that leads to self. Please 
come with me...&quot; 

Rei did not reply verbally, she simply nodded, those locks of palest 
sky blue swaying with the gentle motion of her head.
