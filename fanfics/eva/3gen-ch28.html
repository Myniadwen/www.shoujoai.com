<h1>Third Genesis (part 28 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Yui Ikari&#39;s fingers flew across the keyboard of
Misato&#39;s home computer, studying the various websites
even as she clicked on a new window to enlarge it. A
strong breath puffed some of the shaggy hair up and
out of her eyes, her expression intent as she studied,
sorted and wrote out conclusions all at the same time.

&quot;She&#39;s almost as fast as Ritsuko,&quot; Asuka Langley
admitted, her orange hair flowing down over her
shoulders as she watched Yui type away in the body of
her son, Shinji.

&quot;I think that Ritsuko types a bit faster,&quot; Rei noted
that calmly, her dark blue hair falling into her own
eyes.

&quot;We&#39;ll have to arrange a typing contest sometime,&quot; Yui
said, hitting print then pushing away from the
keyboard with a tired sigh. As her document printed
out she smiled at the two women wryly, &quot;It doesn&#39;t
look like any of the Evangelion tech has leaked to the
internet.&quot;

&quot;You almost sound disappointed,&quot; Rei noted as they
picked their way through the trash that covered the
floor of the mini-office that they used.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I expected NERV to keep such a good lid
on all of this,&quot; Yui admitted, the three entering the
living room and stepping over the dozing Pen Pen.

&quot;They were given some pretty extraordinary powers by
the UN and Japan&#39;s government,&quot; Asuka reminded them.

&quot;A point,&quot; Yui conceded as they sat down on the couch.

The front door rattled as the key was used, then a few
moments later Misato walked into the room, a red
jacket slung over the black haired woman&#39;s shoulder.
There was a spring to her step and a gentle smile on
her face, both signs indicating that her date must
have gone pretty well. &quot;Good evening,&quot; she called to
them cheerfully.

Pen Pen gave her a glare for awakening him then he
closed his eyes again, soon snoring away in the center
of the carpet.

&quot;Hey Misato,&quot; Asuka called from where she and Rei had
flopped down on the couch, Yui sitting in a chair
nearby.

&quot;Did you guys get something for dinner?&quot; Misato asked
as she walked by, dropping her coat off then swinging
by the fridge for a can of beer.

&quot;Yui-san ordered the takeout tonight,&quot; Rei smiled
slightly, &quot;there&#39;s leftovers in the fridge if you&#39;re
still hungry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Misato laughed as she took her own seat,
carefully popping her can and taking a drink, &quot;I ate a
pretty good dinner, too.&quot;

&quot;So what did you and your date do?&quot; Asuka leaned
forward eagerly.

&quot;Aoba Kinushima took me out to a nice dinner, we went
for a drive....&quot; Misato then trailed off suggestively.

&quot;And?&quot; Yui found herself asking.

&quot;And then we played a few rounds of paintball,&quot; Misato
finished.

&quot;Paintball?!&quot; all three young people blurted.

Misato chuckled softly, &quot;It&#39;s better than what it
sounds.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;Actually, I had a
pretty good time tonight.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean you two are going out again?&quot; Asuka
asked eagerly.

Misato actually blushed faintly, &quot;Looks like it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Rei flashed a happy smile as she added a
bit hesitantly, &quot;You&#39;ve been working very hard, you
deserve a break.&quot;

Misato casually waved that off, &quot;You two have been
working nearly as hard at training in the simulators
and with the EVA&#39;s.&quot; She seemed to remember something
and looked at Yui, &quot;Any luck with that net search I
asked you to do?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I left a report on your desk,&quot; Yui said calmly,
&quot;but in summary the Evangelion tech doesn&#39;t seem to
have leaked out.&quot;

&quot;Not yet, anyway,&quot; Misato puffed out a breath.

&quot;You think there&#39;s a leak?&quot; Asuka raised her eyebrows
in surprise.

Misato shook her head grimly, &quot;Not that I know of,
it&#39;s just that so many people now have that
information.&quot; She tossed an apologetic look to Yui
before adding, &quot;Whatever else can be said about Gendo
Ikari, he kept the primary Evangelion data limited to
a small group.&quot;

&quot;While now the data is held by the United Nations and
Security Council, many of the new staff that were
hired to help rebuild the EVAs and the crews that are
currently involved with the Archangels,&quot; Rei noted
thoughtfully.

&quot;The odds increase to almost a certainty that in such
a large group there is someone who will release the
data,&quot; Yui agreed. She looked over at Misato
thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say there&#39;s not much you
can do at this point.&quot;

Changing the subject Asuka grinned, &quot;Did you know that
Maya finally brought Ritsuko over to meet her
parents?&quot;

&quot;Who do you think suggested they should do it?&quot; Misato
laughed softly, taking a drink of her beer. A bit more
seriously she continued on, &quot;Especially now that
they&#39;re thinking of doing a old-fashioned wedding.&quot;

Rei laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to that.&quot;

Yui blinked, her smile a little tentative, &quot;The blonde
scientist and that boyish young woman....&quot; She shook
her head wryly, &quot;I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re happy together,
though I have to say I&#39;m still getting used to the
idea.&quot;

&quot;I guess it is a bit of an adjustment to make,&quot; Misato
conceded the point, thinking of how many years the
woman had been trapped within the EVA Unit-01 before
her spirit was accidentally dumped into Shinji&#39;s body.

Yui nodded, &quot;I have a lot to catch up on.&quot; She looked
at Misato, &quot;Has Dr. Mizuno given her report on me,
yet?&quot;

Misato smiled, &quot;You&#39;re cleared to work, if that&#39;s what
you mean.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Yui puffed out a relieved breath as she
said, &quot;I thought I was going to go stir crazy waiting
to hear.&quot;

&quot;I meant to tell you sooner,&quot; Misato confessed, &quot;but
things were hectic today.&quot;

&quot;Getting ready for her first date in months,&quot; Asuka
said impishly.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve dated a few times!&quot; Misato protested.

&quot;This is the first date I&#39;ve seen you go out on since
I arrived here,&quot; Rei noted, exchanging a impish look
with Asuka.

&quot;Oh sure, double team me now,&quot; Misato sighed.

&quot;We could always be triple teaming you,&quot; Asuka tossed
a look to Yui.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Yui quickly held up her hands as she
protested, &quot;don&#39;t get me involved in this.&quot;

&quot;Spoilsport,&quot; Rei murmured.

Misato sighed in relief, &quot;At least I have one ally
here.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Yui added brightly, &quot;I haven&#39;t been here
long enough to see your dateless state.&quot;

&quot;Et tu, Yui?&quot; Misato muttered. She got up with a sigh,
picking up her empty beer can, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to
stage a tactical retreat.&quot; She gave Asuka and Rei a
look, &quot;You&#39;d better get to bed soon, too, you&#39;ve got
school tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yes Misato,&quot; Asuka and Rei said in a singsong voice.

Yui fought back a chuckle, getting up to follow the
others out of the room. &quot;I won&#39;t have to go to school
too?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Thankfully I can use medical causes to keep you out,&quot;
Misato said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you could fake being
Shinji for very long.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Yui sighed.</pre>
