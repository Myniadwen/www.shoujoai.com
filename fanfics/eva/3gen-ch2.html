<a href="../eva/3gen-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The phone rang shrilly once, then rang again. A hand came out from 
under the covers and reached out blindly. A emply glass fell to the 
floor, a book soon joined it but finally, the receiver was grabbed and 
pulled sluggishly under the covers.

&quot;Yes?&quot; the sleepy voice asked. There was a moment&#39;s pause, then &quot;Yes, 
this is Maya Ibiki. Yes, this is she.&quot;

There was a extended period of silence, and a sleepy mind slowly began 
to work. Suddenly Maya sat right up in her bed, her brown eyes wide 
and her short black hair sticking up wildly as the sheets puddled 
around her waist.

&quot;Misato?&quot; Maya blurted out.

Misato&#39;s clearly amused voice came through loud and clear, &quot;I&#39;m glad 
to hear that you&#39;re awake at last.&quot;

&quot;How can I help you?&quot; Maya squeaked nervously.

Misato quietly said, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll come back to work. NERV has been 
reactivated, and we could use your help.&quot;

&quot;I resigned,&quot; Maya reminded her, &quot;after everything that happened with 
sempai.&quot; She thought of Ritsuko and felt a burst of pain that she 
quickly tried to bury.

&quot;I know,&quot; Misato admitted. She paused for a few seconds, and Maya 
wondered what was happening on the other end of the line. &quot;I was just 
thinking that Ritsuko could really use your help,&quot; Misato said 
casually.

&quot;She&#39;s there?&quot; Maya gasped softly.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t get the charges against her dismissed,&quot; and Misato sounded 
quite amused as she said, &quot;but for her punishment I was able to get 
her assigned as a scientific resource here at NERV.&quot; There was a beat 
of silence, &quot;Things are pretty disorganized here right now. So, would 
you be interested in rejoining NERV?&quot;

Maya didn&#39;t even have to think about it, &quot;I&#39;ll be there. When do you 
need me?&quot;

&quot;As soon as possible,&quot; a relieved Misato answered. &quot;Ritsuko will be 
getting here at Tokyo-3 tomorrow, can you make it here by then?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll be there,&quot; Maya answered her firmly. She found out which 
building to go to and was offered an apartment in the city before she 
gently lay the phone back in to its cradle.

Maya looked around her Tokyo apartment, already thinking of the 
details she needed to attend to. First, she called her landlord, 
explaining that she had to move out immediately. Then, packing her 
clothes.

Most of her items she just bundled up as small as she could and packed 
into the cases, then she reached the bottom drawer of her dresser. She 
pulled it open and almost reverently pulled out the plastic wrapped 
bundle that lay there.

It unfolded easily, her NERV uniform. Maya hadn&#39;t been sure why she 
had saved it so carefully when she had resigned, but now she knew. She 
let herself think the thoughts that she had been fighting back since 
Misato called, &#39;I get to see Ritsuko again!&#39;

Early the next morning, and Maya was ready to go. She called up a few 
friends she had made in Tokyo, put the items she couldn&#39;t pack up into 
storage, and prepared to leave. She had come to Tokyo because she 
wanted to get away from Tokyo-2 and it&#39;s sister city Tokyo-3, and 
everything that they represented to her. She wanted a normal life, or 
as normal as she could get.

The train was easy to catch, the first taking her from Tokyo to Tokyo- 
2. It was a popular trip, people from the city wanting to see the 
&#39;city of the future&#39; that was so nearby. Maya looked out at the 
buildings running by, and let herself think.

Maya remembered some of what happened in the end, at least she thought 
she did. The army had invaded NERV, and she had crouched down behind a 
control panel, waiting for rescue. Or if she was honest with herself, 
waiting to die. Then... it happened.

The gunfire, the weapons discharges, they all slowed, then finally 
stopped. She flowed through the ceiling at her, smiling warmly. 
Ritsuko&#39;s ghost.

&#39;But she&#39;s alive, isn&#39;t she?&#39; a frowning Maya thought to herself. &#39;So 
what was it that I saw?&#39; she wondered. The memories got awfully blurry 
after that, and she eventually found herself back where she started 
from, crouched down in the NERV control center as someone announced 
over the communication system that the fighting was all over.

The next few days were pure chaos. Misato in the hospital, near death. 
Ritsuko being held in a military infirmary, pending her trial for the 
attempted murder of Gendo Ikari. Rei gone, Shinji in a coma, all the 
EVA&#39;s in ruins or missing.

Maya had hit her limit, and tendered her resignation to her immediate 
superior. She left NERV, intending never to return.

&#39;So much for that idea,&#39; Maya thought to herself wryly.

Arriving at Tokyo-2, Maya made a little detour before boarding her 
next train. She changed in the ladies bathroom, pulling on that 
familiar, comfortable uniform once again. She felt curious glances as 
she went to the military train, curiosity and a bit of respect. When 
she showed her NERV pass to the officer at the train, he threw her a 
instant salute.

&#39;What on Earth is going on?&#39; Maya wondered.

She settled into a seat beside another young woman, a dark haired 
woman who looked at her wide eyed. &quot;Are you really a NERV officer?&quot; 
she gushed.

Maya blinked in surprise, &quot;Well, yes...&quot;

The woman actually squealed with happiness. &quot;Where you there for the 
battle for NERV headquarters?&quot; she asked eagerly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Maya answered her cautiously.

&quot;What was it like?&quot; the girl looked at her breathlessly.

&quot;Chaotic,&quot; Maya blinked. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;Oh,&quot; the girl blushed, &quot;my name is Nako.&quot; Maya looked at the girl 
push her large, round glasses up higher on her nose and dearly hoped 
that this trip was going to be much faster than she thought it usually 
was.

Maya left the train, feeling a bit guilty that her new friend had to 
continue onward. She looked around to get her bearings, and then made 
her way through the high tech city.

&quot;Fifth floor,&quot; Maya murmured, checking her hastily scribbled 
directions as she exited the elevator on the correct level, &quot;office 
5-C.&quot; She went a short way down the hall, finding a unmarked office 
door. The one on the left said, &#39;5-B&#39;, the one on the right said, 
&#39;5-D.&#39;

&#39;This must be the place,&#39; Maya thought, putting her hand on the door. 
It opened up under her touch, and she heard a familiar voice.

&quot;... found a Rei Ayanami,&quot; Misato finished.

There was a short pause, and Maya heard Ritsuko say, &quot;A Rei Ayanami? 
You mean another clone?&quot;

Maya drew her hand back, knocking loudly on the doorway.

&quot;Come in,&quot; Misato called out.

Maya pushed the door open and moved to stand in front of Misato, &quot;Maya 
Ibiki, reporting for duty, sir.&quot; She paused, &quot;Or ma&#39;am, whichever 
you&#39;d prefer.&quot; Ritsuko sat up almost as soon as she saw her, and Maya 
had to fight a smile.

&quot;Just Misato,&quot; the dark haired woman smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m not too into 
the military style.&quot;

&quot;Maya,&quot; and Ritsuko smiled, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you.&quot; The blonde pushed 
her hair back nervously, revealing how pale she was.

&#39;I forgot, it hasn&#39;t been that long since she got out of the 
hospital,&#39; Maya thought. Before she could stop herself she asked, 
&quot;Have you been getting enough rest, sempai?&quot;

Ritsuko blushed, looking down as she muttered, &quot;Don&#39;t start mother 
henning me, now.&quot;

Misato shifted on the couch, wincing a bit as she grabbed her ribs. &quot;I 
bet we could both use some of that, actually,&quot; she admitted.

Maya smiled at Misato, silently mouthing &#39;Thank you.&#39;

Misato smiled back, &quot;Why don&#39;t the two of you take the rest of the day 
off, get settled in?&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Ritsuko started.

Misato smiled impishly before adding, &quot;It&#39;ll give the two of you a 
chance to catch up with each other, too.&quot;
