<h1>Altered Destinies (part 15 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Mana Kirishima watched the attack on the room&#39;s
monitors, nearly holding her breath as the two
Evangelions swept forward in perfect synch. In a well
coordinated assault they battled the split Angel, each
one moving as if piloted by the same mind, then in a
final move each shattered the core of the Angel and
destroyed it.

&quot;Well,&quot; Mayumi Yamagishi, the pilot liason in the Jet
Alone project said wryly as she shut the recording
off, &quot;that could have gone better for our project.&quot;
The brown haired, glasses wearing scientist sighed as
she turned from the image to meet Mana&#39;s worried
glance.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry,&quot; Mana said quietly.

Mayumi walked over to where Mana sat in a steel chair
and patted her on the shoulder, &quot;It&#39;s not your fault,
Mana.&quot; She knelt by her side as she added, &quot;We at the
project understand that you did your best.&quot;

&quot;I never expected a Angel to be able to spilt like
that,&quot; Mana admitted, hiding a shudder as she
remembered the creature splitting then pounding
ruthlessly on Jet Alone.

Mayumi squeezed her shoulder gently before letting go.
&quot;Neither did we,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and we should
have. The Angels have been very unpredictable so far
and we should expect that to continue.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean I&#39;m not fired as a pilot?&quot; Mana asked
her, looking up at the older woman hopefully.

Mayumi shook her head, &quot;Of course not. In fact, we
were worried you wanted to quit after the beating you
took.&quot;

Ignoring her bruises Mana stood, wincing slightly as
she said forcefully, &quot;No, it makes me even more
committed to stopping the Angels.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Mayumi nodded as she moved away. Taking on
a more business-like tone she saiud, &quot;Continue to
study the footage, we&#39;ll be discussing the material
more later.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Mana nodded. Quietly she asked, &quot;How
soon will Jet Alone be ready for pre-launch testing?&quot;

&quot;A week or two, so rest up while you can,&quot; Mayumi
answered before she left the pilot debriefing room and
walked down the halls of the military facility not far
from Tokyo-3. She reached her office and went inside,
sitting behind her desk as she activated a
communication device that was built within.

The image of a older man quickly appeared in front of
her, his eyes hidden behind a futuristic visor as he
studied her grimly. &quot;Miss Yamagishi,&quot; Keel Lorenz said
flatly, &quot;I hope you have good news for me.&quot;

&quot;Kirishima is willing to continue to be a pilot,&quot;
Mayumi answered a bit nervously, &quot;and Jet Alone should
be repaired within the month.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Keel nodded slightly. His manner serious he
continued, &quot;SEELE has contributed a great deal of
money into this project, we expect results.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Mayumi stiffened nervously.

&quot;We no longer trust that Ikari and NERV fully serve
our needs,&quot; Keel said grimly, &quot;and the Evangelion has
proven a difficult tool to master. We need a
alternative if things go badly, and for now that
alternative is Jet Alone.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do our best, sir,&quot; Mayumi nodded.

&quot;See that you do,&quot; and with that Keel signed off.

Mayumi sat back with a sigh as she picked up her phone
and dialed. &quot;How long can I serve two masters?&quot; she
wondered aloud as she waited for it to connect.

&quot;Kaji,&quot; the man&#39;s smooth voice answered after a
moment.

&quot;Hello, lover,&quot; Mayumi smirked, &quot;I&#39;ve got more news
for you.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;So, are you and Asuka getting along better?&quot; Toji
Susuhara asked as the group of students lounged
together near the windows.

&quot;Having to live together until we fought the Angel was
tough,&quot; Shinji Ikari admitted, the black haired woman
sitting on the window&#39;s ledge.

&quot;I envy you,&quot; Aida Kensuke sighed.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; a thoughtful looking Toji surprised him by
admitting, &quot;sure Asuka is beautiful, but she&#39;s a real
spitfire.&quot;

Rei Ayanami watched them talk, then Shinji looked up
and met her gaze. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Shinji said as she got
up, walking over to Rei&#39;s side.

&quot;Shinji,&quot; Rei nodded, a faint smile teasing her lips.

Shinji sat down in a empty chair, her black hair tied
back neatly. &quot;I almost wish you had been put there
with me,&quot; she admitted softly.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;I flubbed the landing after the fight,&quot; Shinji
confessed a little sheepishly, &quot;and Asuka started
berating me for it.&quot; She sighed as she continued, &quot;Is
it my fault we were too exhausted to practice that
bit?&quot;

Rei actually chuckled softly at that then continued,
&quot;I&#39;m just glad you made it through all right, Shinji.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Shinji agreed.

Outside in the hall Asuka Soryu Langley paused as she
saw the other girl walking up the hall towards the
classroom. &quot;Kirishima,&quot; she nodded tersely.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; Mana nodded.

&quot;I won&#39;t forgive you spoiling my debut,&quot; Asuka said
coldly, &quot;don&#39;t forget that.&quot;

Mana sighed as Asuka shoved by her, heading into the
classroom. &#39;Just what I need,&#39; she thought as she
followed her in, &#39;a vendetta by a mad Evangelion
pilot.&#39;

Entering the classroom Mana took in the scene, quickly
assessing what was going on. Shinji and Rei were
talking, while a visibly stiff Asuka was taking her
seat. Over in another corner Toji, Aida and the class
rep were talking together, too.

&#39;Asuka looks angry,&#39; Mana noted, &#39;is it because Shinji
and Rei are together?&#39;

&quot;Hello, Mana,&quot; Shinji smiled as she passed to her own
seat.&quot;

&quot;Ikari, Ayanami,&quot; Mana nodded, once more struck by how
nice Shinji could be. &#39;Of course,&#39; she mused, &#39;nice
guys finish last.&#39;

Asuka was already in her seat, occasionally tossing a
smoldering glare at Shinji and Rei. &#39;Does she think no
one notices?&#39; Mana wondered as she sat down. Hanging
up her bookbag she got out her books even as they
waited for the home room teacher to arrive.

&quot;All right, class,&quot; the somewhat creaky older man soon
arrived, &quot;we&#39;ll be discussing international history,
both before and after Second Impact. Please turn to
page...&quot;

Shinji found herself tuning out the teacher,
especially as she found herself thinking of what she
had just learned. During her period of enforced
confinement with Asuka the pilot had been astonished
at Shinji&#39;s ignorance, and had spent some time
educating her.

&#39;Like telling me that Second Impact wasn&#39;t a meteor
strike like I thought,&#39; Shinji mused, &#39;but instead
humanity&#39;s first encounter with a Angel.&#39; An
expedition to the arctic had lead to that encounter,
and one of the scientists there had been Misato&#39;s
father. &#39;I wonder what that must have been like?&#39; she
silently questioned.

&quot;Miss Ikari!&quot; the voice demanded.

&quot;Sir!&quot; Shinji jerked, realizing the teacher had asked
her something.

The old man looked amused, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could
answer the question?&quot;

Shinji felt her cheeks burn as Toji, Aida and the
others gave her sympathetic looks. &quot;No sir,&quot; she
sighed.

&quot;Then you get to write a essay tonight on,&quot; he paused
thoughtfully, &quot;reformation of authority after second
impact. Three pages, double spaced.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Shinji sat down with a sigh.

&quot;All right, who wants to answer the question... Miss
Langley?&quot; he offered.

Asuka stood gracefully, despite the bruises she
probably still had from the earlier fight. &quot;In the
aftermath of Second Impact, there was a broad
breakdown in civil order, mostly brought under control
via martial law and United Nations efforts.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; the teacher nodded wisely.

&#39;As expected of a college educated woman,&#39; Shinji
admitted. &#39;In some ways, she&#39;s far ahead of us all...&#39;
she mused. Add to that Asuka&#39;s origins as a elite
sperm and egg and Shinji found herself wondering if
they&#39;d find anything at all in common.

&#39;Bleh!&#39; Asuka stuck her tongue out at Shinji while
their teacher was writing something up on the board.

&#39;On the other hand, it&#39;s nice to see her do something
so normal, too,&#39; Shinji thought to herself wryly.

Mana had to cover her mouth to contain the urge to
giggle as she watched the two pilots. &#39;These people
are nuts,&#39; she chuckled as she pretended to study. Not
to mention nearly laughing at the perplexed look on
Rei&#39;s face...

&quot;Miss Kirishima , what are you giggling about?&quot; the
teacher demanded.

&#39;Busted,&#39; Mana sighed. &quot;Nothing, sir,&quot; she answered
flatly.

&quot;Well, if nothing amuses you, a report should make you
joyous. Same length as Ikari&#39;s,&quot; he said as he turned
back to the board.

&#39;I think school is worse than fighting Angels,&#39; Mana
sighed as she went back to work.</pre>
