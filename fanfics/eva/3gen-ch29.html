<h1>Third Genesis (part 29 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>&quot;So, how is she?&quot; Misato asked as she watched Yui
Ikari working away in the computer core, running
simulations to try and determine what, exactly, might
have happened to her son Shinji during the final
confrontation with Adam.

&quot;Probably hovering on the edge of a nervous
breakdown,&quot; Ami Mizuno said honestly, blue hair
falling into her eyes. The doctor and psychologist
took a drink of her coffee, &quot;Understandable,
considering her situation.&quot;

&quot;And you still cleared her to work?&quot; Ritsuko asked
with a frown, her blonde hair held back by a simple
set of clips.

&quot;She&#39;s as psychologically healthy as one could expect
o be,&quot; Ami said frankly. &quot;She&#39;s carrying a load of
guilt over her role in the creation of Evangelion, her
soul is stuck in her son&#39;s body and it appears that
he&#39;s trapped in the organic construct she created....&quot;
She shrugged, &quot;Of course Yui is having problems
dealing.&quot;

&quot;She seems so calm,&quot; Misato noted as Yui studied
another set of results on a monitor screen, the boy&#39;s
body she was in eerily intent.

&quot;I suspect she&#39;s trying to bury her reactions in
work,&quot; Ami said, &quot;as well as trying to catch up with
everything that happened while she was trapped in
Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;Are there any warning signs that we need to keep an
eye on?&quot; Ritsuko asked grimly.

&quot;You&#39;ve all had some training to watch for stress
related burnout,&quot; Ami sighed, &quot;keep an eye on those
symptoms. Other than that try to get her to take
regular breaks and interact with other staff, that
should help, too.&quot;

Before Ami could leave the room Misato said, &quot;By the
way, Mizuno-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami asked curiously.

&quot;I was wondering if you were interested in a position
here,&quot; Misato said, &quot;from what I&#39;ve seen, we could use
someone of your skills.&quot;

Ami looked pleased, &quot;Thank you for offering.&quot; A
regretful sigh, &quot;My own research is at a critical
stage, I can&#39;t really abandon it.&quot;

&quot;The offer&#39;s always open,&quot; Misato grinned as a young
woman arrived to escort Ami out.

Turning to look at Yui again Ritsuko murmured a few
moments later, &quot;I wonder how she and the Magi are
getting along?&quot;

&quot;Well, they don&#39;t seem to be killing each other,&quot;
Misato offered brightly.

&quot;That&#39;s not comforting,&quot; Ritsuko winced.

Down below Yui worked away even as she talked verbally
with the now conscious and fully integrated computer
system. &quot;Your husband was a cad, you must admit,&quot; Magi
said in her feminine tones, the voice almost holding a
hint of amusement.

&quot;The more I hear about what he did after I was gone,&quot;
Yui said as she worked, &quot;the more I&#39;m tempted to agree
with you.&quot; A pause and she said in a sad tone, &quot;But he
didn&#39;t seem to be that way when we were married...&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Magi conceded. A frown, &quot;Even worse, I
can&#39;t believe that he threw my creator aside to pursue
her daughter.&quot;

&quot;Ritsuko and Gendo were involved?&quot; Yui raised her
eyebrows in surprise. A frown, &quot;That might explain her
discomfort around me....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the Magi sounded contrite, &quot;I didn&#39;t
realize you didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d guess it&#39;s common knowledge in NERV?&quot; Yui asked
it, feeling grimly certain that she knew the answer.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Magi confirmed, &quot;it became common knowledge
when Ritsuko attempted to destroy the spare Rei
clones.&quot;

&quot;Quite the soap opera here,&quot; Yui muttered, hitting a
switch to run another computer simulation. What they
were trying to do was reconstruct the series of events
that had caused Shinji&#39;s consciousness to leave his
body to enter Evangelion Unit 01 and her own to enter
his body. So far, they were batting zero.

&quot;Insufficient data to generate result,&quot; came up on the
screen again, the data scrolling by. Part of the
problem was that they were trying to reconstruct the
series of events via damaged image files, blurred
memories and other odd occurrences between Shinji and
the Unit-01. &quot;Processing error, Abort or Retry?&quot; the
computer screen showed.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Yui slammed a hand down on the counter, not
even noticing the pain. &quot;I wish we had more data on
Rei&#39;s final transformation....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Magi sounded like she was, too, &quot;my
systems were under assault by the United Nations at
the time, I was unable to properly record the event.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re back at step one,&quot; Yui mused.

&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Magi answered a bit hesitantly. &quot;In
examining witness accounts of the events inside NERV,
many individuals recall seeing phantom images of their
loved ones.&quot;

&quot;If it was connected to the body switch,&quot; Yui quickly
saw where the computer was going, &quot;there might have
been a residue left of the energies involved. Do you
have that scan data on file?&quot;

&quot;After the computer restart shortly after the
reactivation of NERV by Misato Katsuragi, we performed
a full sensor sweep of the facility,&quot; Magi confirmed,
&quot;the quantity of data involved is enormous, however.&quot;

&quot;How enormous?&quot; Yui asked with a sinking feeling.

&quot;Several gigabytes worth,&quot; Magi confirmed.

&quot;Well,&quot; Yui sighed, &quot;at least sorting it out will keep
us busy.&quot;

&quot;Yui-san?&quot; Maya smiled as she walked up. Setting a cup
of coffee down beside her she asked, &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re achieving new and unprecedented levels of
bafflement,&quot; Yui answered wryly, picking up the coffee
and drinking.

Maya chuckled softly, &quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry we have little progress to report,&quot; the
Magi added.

&quot;Are you eliminating some of the possibilities?&quot; Maya
asked. A smile, &quot;From what I understand scientific
progress often involves that.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Yui conceded.

&quot;Maya,&quot; the Magi quietly asked, &quot;did you experience
any unusual visions during the battle for NERV?&quot;

Maya hesitated, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Several witnesses reported unusual phenomena,&quot; Magi
answered promptly, &quot;we were speculating that it might
have a relationship with what happened to Yui.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Maya trailed off uncomfortably.

Feeling sympathetic to Maya Yui quietly said, &quot;If
you&#39;re not comfortable about it, you don&#39;t have to
tell us.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, just.. do you promise not to tell
anyone?&quot; Once Maya got their agreement she continued,
&quot;I thought that Ritsuko&#39;s ghost had appeared,
honestly. She held me, it was the most wonderful
feeling.. then everything went black.&quot; She shrugged,
&quot;That&#39;s all I remember.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Magi said, sounding
thoughtful.

Yui nodded, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Turning towards the
computer she asked, &quot;So you think it might have been a
out of body experience?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; Magi conceded, &quot;or a mass psychic
phenomena.&quot;

&quot;We could be on to something,&quot; and with that Yui
quickly went back to work.

Watching the two busily at work Maya shook her head
with a smile. &quot;Well, at least that seems to have
helped,&quot; she murmured before heading off to see what
else she needed to do.</pre>
