<h1>Altered Destinies (part 11 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;Damn it, stop thinking so loud,&quot; Asuka growled as
they lurched, the red Unit 02 fighting to keep it&#146;s
balance on the deck of the ship.

&quot;Trying,&quot; Shinji answrered, holding on to the back of
the seat in the entry plug, the plug suit she had
borrowed from Asuka clinging to her body.

The Angel was a black shape beneath the water racing
with incredible speed as the navy vessels tried
uselessly to destroy it. It had attacked with almost
no warning, leaving them scrambling to prepare any
kind of defense.

&quot;We&#146;ve only got the prog knife as a weapon,&quot; Asuka
said as she scanned the water, &quot;we have to let it get
close.&quot;

&quot;But if we hit the water we&#146;re in trouble,&quot; Shinji
smiled slightly, &quot;I rather doubt a Evangelion can
swim.&quot;

&quot;Obviously,&quot; Asuka answered coldly.

&quot;So, you like Kaji?&quot; Shinji asked casually.

&quot;What?&quot; Asuka blurted, blushing. &quot;Why are you asking
me that now?&quot;

&quot;No time like the present,&quot; Shinji answered even as
she saw a shadow at the corner of her eye.
&quot;Incoming!&quot;she cried, pointing.

&quot;I see it,&quot; Asuka wheeled the Eva around, knife at the
ready and sliced, taking a chunk off the Angel&#146;s side,
a fin dropping away to hit the water. In fact she
hadn&#146;t seen it coming, and was a bit disturbed that
Shinji had. Clearly the pilot was more capable than
Asuka had first thought.

&quot;It&#146;s circling,&quot; Shinji blinked as the dark shape
moved awkwardly in the water. Her eyes widened, &quot;It
can&#146;t maneuver without both fins!&quot;

&quot;The one is regenerating fast,&quot; Asuka murmured as a
dangerous idea began to form.

Obviously, Shinji was thinking similar thoughts as she
said, &quot;But we&#146;ve got a shot. Should we take it?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s a gamble...&quot; Asuka was tempted.

&quot;The longer this thing is active,&quot; Shinji looked sly,
&quot;the better chance it has of taking out the ship with
Kaji on it.&quot;

&quot;You fight dirty.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes it&#146;s the only way to win,&quot; Shinji shrugged.

&quot;Let&#146;s go,&quot; and with that Asuka dove her Evangelion
off the sideof the ship.

&quot;What are they DOING?&quot; Misato squealed, holding the
binoculars to her eyes.

&quot;Damn I need a smoke,&quot; Kaji muttered, the brown haired
man restlessly scratching at the stubble on his chin.

&quot;They&#146;re going after the injured Angel, aren&#146;t they?&quot;
Rei asked flatly, but her red eyes were narrowed in
concern.

&quot;That&#146;s insane,&quot; Maya blurted, her eyes wide.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Misato reluctantly handed the
binoculars to the patiently waiting Rei, &quot;it looked
like they hurt it badly.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the sort of risk Asuka&#146;d take,&quot; Kaji admitted
as they waited for some sign.

&quot;I wouldn&#146;t have expected Shinji to, though,&quot; Maya
noted.

&quot;The girl has unexpected depths,&quot; Misato conceded.

Suddenly water fountained up as the Angel threw itself
out of the water, Unit-02 firmly on it&#146;d back. Seizing
the opportunity the Evangelion struck with the
progressive knife, driving the blade into the Angel&#146;s
core in a flash of light. The creature collapsed after
thrashing around a bit and the Evangelion was hauled
onto the deck of the ship by it&#146;s power cable.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rei cried as they raced from the bridge
down to the deck.

The Evangelion&#146;s entry plug had already been popped
out when they reached the deck and as it popped open
they were greeted by quite a sight. A bitterly
swearing Asuka and Shinji were in a tangle of limbs in
the seat, obviously thrown about by the Angel&#146;s death
struggles.

Taking in the scene Misato smirked, &quot;Well, Shinji, was
it good for you?&quot;

&quot;Misato!&quot; Shinji scolded as she fell out of the entry
plug and onto the deck.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rei asked, the blue haired girl
offering Shinji a hand up.

Shinji took it, &quot;Nothing hurt but my pride.&quot;

&quot;You all right?&quot; Kaji asked Asuka calmly.

&quot;Other than that pervert feeling me up,&quot; Asuka said as
she brushed herself off.

&quot;I fell on you,&quot; Shinji protested.

&quot;Likely story,&quot; Asuka sniffed.

&quot;Was it more difficult piloting the Eva with two
people inside?&quot; Maya asked, organizer out to make
notes in.

&quot;Huh?&quot; they all looked at her in surprise.

&quot;I&#146;m sure Dr. Akagi would be interested,&quot; Maya said
defensively.

&quot;She&#146;s got a point,&quot; Misato admitted.

&quot;The Unit-02 was confused by out thinking in German
and Japanese at first,&quot; Asuka conceded as the two gave
their report.

&quot;You seeing what I&#146;m seeing?&quot; Kaji asked Misato
softly.

&quot;Rei hasn&#146;t let go of Shinji&#146;s hand yet,&quot; Misato
smiled slightly. &quot;In fact, I don&#146;t even think she&#146;s
aware she&#146;s doing it.&quot;

&quot;You want to tell her?&quot; Kaji asked.

&quot;Nah.&quot;

Maya nodded as she finished her notes, &quot;Thank you very
much.&quot;

&quot;So were you worried about me, Kaji?&quot; Asuka asked
charmingly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Kaji grinned disarmingly.

As officers hurried about Rei and Shinji found
themselves sitting off to the side, watching the chaos
unfold. &quot;What was it like piloting with Asuka?&quot; Rei
asked, her thumb moving in circles again&#146;s Shinji&#146;s
skin.

Shinji smiled wryly, &quot;She swears like a sailor.&quot;

A smile actually tugged at Rei&#146;s lips. &quot;I&#146;m not
surprised,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;It was odd,&quot; Shinji admitted after a moment, &quot;there
was a moment when we were on that Angel that I thought
we were going to die.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;It was as if,&quot; Shinji gestured awkwardly, &quot;our wills
became one. We were just not going to let that thing
win.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Rei&#146;s voice took on a flat tone as she
released Shinji&#146;s hand.

&quot;I couldn&#146;t live with myself if you or the others had
been hurt,&quot; Shinji admitted.

Rei&#146;s gaze softened again. &quot;I&#146;m glad,&quot; she said.</pre>
