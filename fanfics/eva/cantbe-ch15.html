<h1>If I Can't Be Yours (part 15 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rocketbabe.html">RocketBabe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Monday marked their first day at work as a couple. They stopped at the 
launderette on their way to work, as they usually did on Monday. Aoba 
didn&#39;t comment on the pair of them arriving together, though Maya 
suspected that he had guessed more than he was letting on.

All of the employees with whom they came into contact noticed the 
difference in them, both were indisputably happier and much more light- 
hearted than they had been previously and their productivity, Maya&#39;s 
especially, had increased dramatically. Misato cornered Ritsuko in her 
office shortly after her arrival, with two mugs of coffee. &quot;Heya Dr 
Akagi, I see you&#39;ve recovered from this weekend.&quot; She winked and flashed 
Ritsuko a grin.

&quot;Yes, thankyou, I had a good time on Friday. As I said, we should go out 
more often.&quot;

&quot;There ya go, that&#39;s the girl I knew in college.&quot; She took a sip from 
her own drink, handing the other to Ritsuko. &quot;So, what&#39;s new? I don&#39;t 
think you need me to tell you how down you seemed last week, but now, 
don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s great to see you happy again, but I kinda 
wondered what you&#39;ve been doing.&quot; A cheeky glint appeared in her eye. 
&quot;Or WHO you&#39;ve been doing!&quot;

Ritsuko almost choked on her coffee but couldn&#39;t help smirking as she 
replied. &quot;That really is none of your concern, CAPTAIN, am I going to 
have to file a complaint about your inappropriate professional conduct?&quot;

&quot;Aww c&#39;mon Ritsu, I&#39;m just showing the interest of a friend. You&#39;ve not 
had a look like this about you since the last time you.that&#39;s it isn&#39;t 
it? You&#39;ve met someone!&quot;

&quot;Again, that information is not pertinent to our current situation. How 
are the children? Are they all suited up and ready for the prolonged 
activation test?&quot;

&quot;Aww, quit trying to change the subject! Won&#39;t you give me a name, if 
nothing else?&quot;

&quot;I can think of plenty of names for you right now.&quot; Ritsuko always 
enjoyed winding Misato up, if only because she was so easily led.

Her dark-haired friend was fuming but at the same time trying to keep 
her voice calm. &quot;Fine. Don&#39;t tell me. I don&#39;t care who you&#39;re screwing 
anyway, I&#39;ll just be happy for you without knowing a damn thing as to 
why.&quot;

Ritsuko grinned, shaking her head. &quot;Feigned indifference as an 
information gathering tactic. Come on Misato, give me SOME credit at 
least, anyone can see through that act.&quot;

Misato replied to the taunt with mock haughtiness. &quot;I don&#39;t have to take 
that crap from you first thing in the morning, it really isn&#39;t worth 
it.&quot; She headed for the door.

&quot;You will probably find out in due course anyway.&quot; She looked Misato in 
the eye for the first time during their whole exchange. &quot;But it&#39;s early 
days for us at the moment, we&#39;re still getting to know each other and I 
don&#39;t want to jinx it.&quot;

Misato stopped just short of jumping up and down on the spot but her 
excitement still showed through. &quot;So I was right! You DO have someone! 
Well, congratulations kid, I hope it all goes well for you, you deserve 
it. And I won&#39;t ask any more questions if you don&#39;t want me to. For 
today at least.&quot;

Ritsuko smiled. &quot;Thanks Misato, you nosy bitch.&quot; She winked. &quot;If it goes 
well maybe I&#39;ll introduce the two of you one day.&quot;

Misato grinned again as she opened the door. &quot;Yeah, It&#39;d be nice to meet 
the person who&#39;s made you so happy all of a sudden, they must be 
something really special.&quot; Misato hadn&#39;t noticed Maya&#39;s appearance at 
the open doorway until the brunette coughed politely. &quot;Oh, hey Maya.&quot; 
She glanced at the steaming mug in Maya&#39;s hands. &quot;Heh, sorry, looks like 
I beat ya to it.&quot; But she winked good-naturedly before breezing away 
down the corridor. Maya glanced to Ritsuko, who beckoned her in. Maya 
allowed the door to close behind her.

&quot;Well, sempai, I guess you won&#39;t be wanting this after all.&quot; She looked 
down at the coffee mug, almost dejectedly, but Ritsuko took it from her, 
pushing the cup Misato had given her to one side.

&quot;No, no, I&#39;ll take that, thankyou Maya.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Captain Katsuragi 
means well but you&#39;d think after 29 years she&#39;d have learnt how to NOT 
make coffee taste of paint thinner.&quot; She took a grateful sip from the 
mug Maya had brought for her and sighed. &quot;That&#39;s heavenly Maya, is there 
anything you can&#39;t do?&quot; Maya blushed and looked down at her feet as 
Ritsuko stood up and moved next to Maya, placing her arms around her in 
a gentle embrace, then kissing her, softly at first but as Maya was 
drawn into it, it became more passionate. Their breathing deepened and 
Maya made a tiny whimpering noise as she allowed one of her hands to 
caress Ritsuko&#39;s back whilst the other unzipped a pathway into her 
shirt, to the black lace bra and the soft, perfect breasts of her lover. 
&quot;Dr Ritsuko Akagi to the Pribnow box to initiate activation tests, Dr 
Ritsuko Akagi to the Pribnow box to initiate activation tests.&quot; 
Ritsuko&#39;s stomach lurched as she pulled away from Maya and found 
herself, not for the first time, wishing that ANY voice except her 
mother&#39;s had been used for the electronic tannoy system co-ordinated by 
the MAGI. She reluctantly pulled away from Maya and rezipped her shirt, 
still panting for breath.

&quot;Dammit&quot; she hurriedly kissed Maya again. &quot;We&#39;d better go.&quot; Another 
kiss. &quot;But I will make this up to you later, I promise.&quot; With that, they 
both hurried out of the office, with nothing but flushed cheeks and 
tousled hair to suggest what they had been up to.

TO BE CONTINUED..

nyaaah hope y&#39;all are enjoying it so far and all that jazz. Perhaps some 
of you are thinking &quot;why are there so many short chapters when you could 
have just done a few long ones?&quot; Good question. It&#39;s personal 
preference.

Anywho, as yet I&#39;ve not exactly finished writing this. I have my plot 
and suchlike all planned out, but nothing is fo&#39; shizzle as yet. But 
there will be more. Just don&#39;t rush me, aiight?</pre>
