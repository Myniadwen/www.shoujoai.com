<h1>If I Can't Be Yours (part 16 of 16)</h1>

<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>She was reaching to press the doorbell for a second time when the door 
opened. Her ex-girlfriend offered a hand, which Maya shook carefully 
without smiling.

&#147;Yoshimi, I can&#146;t stay for long, I just want to get the rest of my stuff 
and go.&#148; By avoiding smalltalk, Maya was hoping to make the whole 
process easier on herself yet she still had that same gnawing, churning 
feeling in the pit of her stomach and her heart was beating ten to the 
dozen. Her ex-lover on the other hand, seemed much calmer, almost 
serene.

&#147;Of course, come on in.&#148; Maya shuddered ever so slightly as she stepped 
into the familiar room. Nothing had changed since she had last been 
there, save the fact that now it was no longer the entrance to her own 
home. Although she didn&#146;t regret leaving, a pang of something akin to 
homesickness hit her, it was only brief but it caught her off-guard and 
reaffirmed her desire to keep this visit short. Maya had also been 
caught out by how attractive she still found Yoshimi, even in the 
scruffy cutoffs and black vest, her usual attire for slobbing at home. 
&#147;Would you like a drink?&#148; Maya couldn&#146;t avoid the thirst that had crept 
upon her making the journey back to her old home in the 95 degree heat.

&#147;Umm, just a glass of water please.&#148; Yoshimi winked at her.

&#147;Sure. Do you want to sit down down for a few minutes before you start 
packing? You look like you&#146;re burning up, a rest might do you good.&#148; 
Against her better judgement, Maya agreed. She sat down at the familiar 
kitchen table and couldn&#146;t avoid the conversations sparked by her 
ex-lover. &#147;So, how are you doing Maya?&#148; Maya accepted the glass handed 
to her with a gracious smile.

&#147;I&#146;m fine, thank you. Work has been somewhat hectic this week, there was 
the citywide power cut I&#146;m sure you know about. Otherwise I&#146;m okay. How 
about you?&#148; Yoshimi pushed a lock of her thick, jet-black hair behind 
her left ear and smiled again.

&#147;Oh I&#146;m good thanks. The massage business is booming at the moment, 
everybody is so stressed with all of these attacks on the city, it&#146;s 
working out great for us at work.&#148; They both smiled awkwardly during the 
ensuing few second&#146;s silence. &#147;Have you found a place to stay yet?&#148; Maya 
cleared her throat and raised a cynical eyebrow.

&#147;Yes, as it happens, though your sudden concern surprises me. Remind me 
again, who exactly kicked who out of this apartment?&#148; Yoshimi sighed and 
looked down at the table.

&#147;I can&#146;t defend what I did, Maya, but I still care about your welfare, 
it&#146;s not like I want you to be on the streets. You could always have 
stayed here until you sorted yourself out.&#148; Maya snorted indignantly.

&#147;And listened to you fucking him in our bed all night? I&#146;d rather sleep 
in a doorway in the goddamn red light district.&#148; Maya could feel the 
anger rising inside her, but didn&#146;t stop. &#147;You&#146;ve got a cheek pretending 
you&#146;re actually bothered about how I&#146;m doing after you told me you never 
wanted to see me in your house again.&#148; Yoshimi sighed.

&#147;I can understand that you&#146;re upset with me Maya, but I was angry then, 
I know that doesn&#146;t excuse what I said or did, but you have to admit 
we&#146;ve both said things we didn&#146;t mean when we fought.&#148;

&#147;When did you suddenly gain this enlightenment? Or is this just how HE 
likes you to talk?&#148; Maya was beign highly unreasonable now and she knew 
it. She hated letting herself get to this stage, so she took a deep 
breath. &#147;Look, I&#146;ve got no intention of having this discussion with you 
right now, or ever in fact. I&#146;m just going to pack my cases and go, then 
you can get on with your life and let me do the same.&#148;

&#147;Maya, I know this can&#146;t be easy for you, but it&#146;s hard for me too!&#148; 
Maya rolled her eyes as she left the kitchen. That remark was so typical 
of Yoshimi, utterly self-centred woman that she was. When they had been 
together, Maya had dealt with it graciously, after all, her ex partner 
had been an overindulged only child so knew no different way to behave. 
She also had the considerable advantages of seemingly boundless charm 
when it was useful to her and outstanding physical beauty. Maya had 
loved her despite the self absorption, it was a result of her 
circumstances and therefore Yoshimi didn&#146;t really have a choice in it 
did she? She had been used to the adoration of others and had never 
wanted for anything her whole life. It had been almost an endearing 
character trait whilst the two of them were together, but now that she 
could view Yoshimi objectively, Maya objected on an almost visceral 
level to the other woman&#146;s blatant histrionics. Without a word in 
response she made her way towards what had once been their bedroom.

It had taken Maya under half an hour to gather all of her belongings 
together and pack them into her two cases. She dragged them to the front 
and shot a disapproving glare at the men&#146;s trainers that now stood in 
the same place her work boots once had. Yoshimi emerged from the kitchen 
to bid her farewell. She smiled benignly and without warning embraced 
Maya tightly. Maya did not reciprocate, simply turned on her heels with 
a curt &#147;Goodbye.&#148;

Ritsuko could tell that Maya wasn&#146;t quite feeling herself as soon as she 
came through the door. Upon questioning she claimed to be fine, thus 
confirming Ritsuko&#146;s suspicions that all was not well, but pressing the 
issue didn&#146;t seem fair on Maya. Besides, it wasn&#146;t as if Ritsuko 
couldn&#146;t guess what had upset her girlfriend. They carried on as usual, 
enjoying their lazy Saturday evening together. They cooked chilli and 
ate together, then snuggled close together on the sofa to watch TV and 
share a bottle of red wine, though their attention was not really on the 
screen in front of them. They had been together for only three weeks, a 
period of time they had spent mostly at work or asleep, so the leisure 
time they had together tended to be spent in physical closeness and the 
satisfaction of basic desires.

Ritsuko lay on her front, allowing Maya to straddle her and massage her 
shoulders as a thank you from Maya for cleaning up after dinner. She 
sighed as she felt her muscles relaxing under Maya&#146;s hands. &#147;Mmmm, 
either I&#146;ve been more stressed than I&#146;ve given myself credit for, or you 
are incredible at that, Maya, this feels absolutely beautiful.&#148;

Maya was grateful that Ritsuko couldn&#146;t see her face, as she blushed 
pink at the compliment. &#147;Well, you are very tense, especially through 
your deltoids. You need to cut down on the amount of stress you get at 
work.&#148; Ritsuko tensed slightly at the mention of work, so Maya pressed 
harder, eliciting a soft moan from her partner. She pulled back her 
hands as if she&#146;d been burned. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, am I hurting you?&#148;

A lazy chuckle escaped Ritsuko&#146;s lips. &#147;Oh God no, that&#146;s divine, you 
really need to teach me how to do this, I feel shitty for not being able 
to reciprocate.&#148; Maya smiled as she eased her grip and places a few 
kisses down Ritsuko&#146;s back.

&#147;Just keep cleaning up after meals, my sempai, and we&#146;ll be even. How do 
you feel?&#148; Ritsuko mumbled something unintelligible and sighed 
blissfully. &#147;OK, you stay there for a second whilst I go and wash my 
hands, take it from me, that oil is not nice anywhere except your skin.&#148;

When Maya returned, Ritsuko had rolled onto her back and was watching 
what had come onto the television, a dubbed late-night show from the 
states about fetish nightclubs. Maya felt a familiar tingling sensation 
between her thighs and was sure she was blushing again. Ritsuko smirked 
cheekily at her. &#147;Not getting any ideas are you, Maya-chan?&#148; Maya 
giggled a little awkwardly as Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. The older woman 
held her eyes out to her partner. &#147;Come and kiss me, you exotic, erotic, 
massage-giving beauty!&#148; Maya laughed as she lay on top of Ritsuko, 
pressing closely against her along the whole length of her body. She 
stifled a yawn, which didn&#146;t go unnoticed by her lover. &#147;Tired?&#148; Maya 
nodded. She was more exhausted emotionally than physically, visiting her 
old flat had taken its toll on her, as if it was the final item of 
closure on her relationship with Yoshimi, the final thing she needed 
before she could move on. As she cuddled Ritsuko, any remaining sorrow 
dissipated. At that point, in the arms of the woman she had pined for 
and adored for so long, Maya could not remember a time when she had been 
happier.
