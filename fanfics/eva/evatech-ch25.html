<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 25 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>&quot;Welcome everyone,&quot; the host smiled charmingly, his
tuxedo hugging a slim form, &quot;my name is Kaworu Nagisa,
and I&#39;ll be your host tonight! This is the night
you&#39;ve all been waiting for, the beginning of the Miss
Macros Pageant!&quot; A wink, &quot;Don&#39;t we all love those
men.. I mean, women in uniform?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s quite flamboyant, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Captain Misato
Katsuragi noted from where she sat in the audience for
the rehearsal. The officer was dressed in a casual
black dress, her uniform coat over top and her black
hair flowing over her shoulders.

&quot;Put him in a dress, he could probably enter,&quot; Kaji
wryly agreed, smoking a cigarette quite illegally in
the theater.

&quot;Oooh, bad mental image,&quot; Misato winced.

&quot;Now, from Macross herself our first entry, Mana
Kirishima!&quot; Kaworu waved as the girl walked out from
the sidelines.

A young lady with short red hair emerged, her dress a
summer style number with light fabric that flowed
around her. &quot;Hello,&quot; she smiled shyly, &quot;my name is
Mana, I&#39;m from Yokohama and transferred to Macross
shortly before we all ended up here.&quot; A smile, &quot;I&#39;m a
military test pilot, love to cook and hope to have
children later in life.&quot;

&quot;Everybody give a big cheer for Mana,&quot; Kaworu waved.
&quot;Mana,&quot; he smiled down at her, &quot;are you seeing
someone?&quot;

&quot;N... no,&quot; Mana blushed.

&quot;Well you can trust me when I say you&#39;ll be snatched
up after this,&quot; Kaworu winked as Mana retreated off
stage..

&quot;Poor kid,&quot; Ritsuko Akagi murmured from where the
blonde officer sat on the other side of Misato.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re not back stage with Maya,&quot;
Misato noted.

&quot;Maya sent me out here,&quot; a blushing Ritsuko admitted,
&quot;she said my fussing around made her nervous.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t blame her for that,&quot; Kaji conceded.

&quot;Next up is the blonde bombshell of stage and screen,&quot;
Kaworu gestured boldly as he cried, &quot;Satsuki Ooi!&quot;

Satsuki strode out confidently, her blonde hair
bouncing down her back as she smiled and waved at the
imaginary audience. &quot;Hello Macross,&quot; Satsuki smiled
sweetly, &quot;I love to sing and dance, and look forward
to entertaining you.&quot;

&quot;Is it really fair to have a ringer like this in the
contest?&quot; Misato wondered.

Kaji shrugged casually, &quot;Contest had to be open to
everybody or there would have been complaints.&quot;

&quot;So, what should we be looking forward to from you?&quot;
Kaworu asked leadingly.

&quot;Just wait for the swimsuit contest,&quot; Satsuki winked,
&quot;I&#39;ll blow you away.&quot;

&quot;She is such a slut,&quot; Ritsuko sighed as Satsuki
scampered off stage.

&quot;Rits-chan,&quot; Misato scolded teasingly.

&quot;Too bad Ayanami couldn&#39;t be in this rehearsal,&quot; Kaji
noted, &quot;I&#39;d love to see how she&#39;d respond to THAT.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a bit busy,&quot; Misato frowned.

On the bridge a remarkably nervous Lieutenant Makoto
Hyuga sat in the captain&#39;s chair, his glasses gleaming
as he watched the busy activity on the bridge. &quot;Why
did I get left in command?&quot; he wondered aloud.

&quot;Cause Misato knows you&#39;re reliable?&quot; Lieutenant
Shigeru Aoba said with a grin, the long brown haired
man standing at the fighter ops station.

&quot;Or she knows she can dump the job on you and won&#39;t
complain,&quot; Kozo Fuyutsuki noted with dry amusement,
the older man sitting in the second in command chair.
While technically outranking both younger men he was a
engineer and scientist, and was therefore not in the
line of command.

&quot;Sir,&quot; Motoko asked tentatively, &quot;what&#39;s it like,
working with Gendo?&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Fuyutsuki answered calmly.

Outside, a wave of Evangelion fighters soared by, the
fighter patrols scouring the skies above the SDF-1.
&quot;Keep up, damn it,&quot; Asuka Langley said coldly as she
radioed a lagging pilot, &quot;dropping out of formation
could get you killed.&quot;

&quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; a pilot stammered back.

&quot;Go easy,&quot; Rei Ayanami said to her quietly on a
private frequency, &quot;he&#39;s barely gotten his wings.&quot;

Asuka sighed, &quot;Right. I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m the sort
of person to help whip into shape these young pilots.&quot;

&quot;Could be worse,&quot; Rei offered as the squads again
preformed the training maneuver.

&quot;How?&quot; Asuka asked as she saw the one pilot fall
behind again.

Rei grinned, &quot;You could have just shot him.&quot;

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Asuka grit her teeth, &quot;I&#39;m thinking about
it.&quot; Raising her voice and switching to a public
channel she roared, &quot;Get in formation or the Zentradi
won&#39;t HAVE to kill you, Ill do it MYSELF!&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; a chorus of terrified voices called back.

&quot;Remind me not to piss her off,&quot; Shinji Ikari noted as
she guided his own team of pilot trainees. He flew
with his usual precision and grace, and even with him
holding back the youngsters were barely keeping up.

&quot;Do you think it&#39;s PMS?&quot; a woman pilot offered
nervously.

&quot;No, she&#39;s like that all the time,&quot; Shinji grinned.

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Asuka growled at him.

&quot;Oops,&quot; Shinji sighed.

To be continued...

Notes: Mana Kirishima is from the Girlfriend of Steel
game and Satsuki Ooi is a &quot;bridge bunny&quot; character
from another Eva game.
