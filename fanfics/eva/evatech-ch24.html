<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 24 of 29)</h1>

<a href="../eva/evatech-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>&quot;Exedore,&quot; Breetai said as the giant Zentradi lounged
in his command chair, &quot;I hope you have good news.
Dolza grows impatient.&quot;

The smaller, deformed Zentradi bowed to him
respectfully. &quot;Indeed Lord Breetai,&quot; Exedore answered,
&quot;I believe that we have successfully cracked the
language barrier between us and the Micronians.&quot;

Breetai stood, smiling slightly. &quot;Good,&quot; he said,
&quot;maybe we can begin to anticipate our enemy&#39;s moves.&quot;

&quot;We are still trying to understand all of their odd
behaviors,&quot; Exedore cautioned, &quot;but studying their
broadcasts we have assembled a partial report.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Breetai nodded.

Activating a monitor Exedore began, &quot;Zor&#39;s ship
crashed to their planet&#39;s surface decades ago, ending
a period of global warfare. They turned from
destroying one another to rebuilding the vessel as
well as preparing for the arrival of someone like us.&quot;

&quot;Those transformable fighting craft,&quot; Breetai
realized, &quot;they were intended to let the Micronians
match us in size and power.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Exedore agreed. He brought up another image
of the SDF-1, &quot;They call this the Super Dimensional
Fortress, I believe in reference to the Fold ability,
and the number indicates their hope of building more,&quot;
he said.

&quot;They can&#39;t... can they?&quot; Breetai asked with some
concern.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Exedore admitted, &quot;we Zentradi would
not have been able to attempt a repair of Zor&#39;s
ship... they clearly have. They have also apparently
either altered the design or unlocked capabilities
within it that we were unaware of.&quot;

&quot;High Command, and especially Dolza, must not learn of
this,&quot; Breetai rumbled after a moment. &quot;If they
believe these Micronians to be capable of that he will
burn their world clean as a threat to our kind... and
the Masters.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be passing the report on,&quot; Exedore agreed. He
activated a viewscreen, &quot;We&#39;ve also stumbled across a
disturbing image.&quot;

&quot;Two Micronians, and one has longer hair and,&quot; Breetai
frowned upon taking a closer look, &quot;chest
deformation?&quot;

&quot;They call that one a female,&quot; Exedore said, &quot;now,
watch this.&quot;

Pressing a button Exedore cued the image to start, and
a oddly disturbing sound filled the chamber as the two
beings on the screen moved closer together. &quot;What is
that horrid sound?&quot; Breetai demanded irritably.

&quot;I believe they call it music, sir,&quot; Exedore
explained.

The two stood remarkably close, the deformed one
looking up at the taller Micronian. Then they pressed
even closer, the tall one brought his face close to
the other then shockingly their lips were smushed
together forcefully.

&quot;Eugggh!&quot; Breetai almost leapt out of his chair in
revulsion, only his steely self control keeping him in
his seat.

&quot;Yes, my technitians reacted the same way,&quot; Exedore
noted as he watched his leader fighting not to be ill.

&quot;What are they DOING?&quot; Breetai choked out.

&quot;It&#39;s something called kissing, according to the data
I accessed,&quot; Exedore said as he shut the images down.

&quot;It&#39;s a devestating psycological weapon,&quot; Breetai
muttered, forcibly getting his reactions under control
once more.

Exedore nodded, &quot;Strangely, according to the
documentation the Micronians seem to find such
activities pleasurable.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Breetai looked skeptical.

&quot;There&#39;s an entire data stream on the SDF-1 devoted to
such things,&quot; Exedore checked his notes, &quot;a 4chan, I
believe.&quot;

&quot;We really are very different,&quot; Breetai admitted,
gazing at the image of Zor&#39;s ship. &#145;What are you
planning?&#39; he mused, &#145;What is going through your mind,
my worthy foe?&#39;

&quot;It&#39;s beer time,&quot; Captain Misato Katsuragi cheered,
getting up from the center seat with a bounce to her
step.

&quot;You&#39;re not setting a good example, Misato,&quot; Commander
Ritsuko Akagi said as the dyed blonde sat in the
captain&#39;s seat.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Misato leaned forward as the black haired
woman said, &quot;You&#39;re not really one to talk,
Rits-chan.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ritsuko raised a eyebrow.

&quot;Another noise complaint from officer&#39;s quarters,&quot; a
smirk grew as Misato continued, &quot;a certain pair of
women being too loud. Ring any bells?&quot;

Ritsuko fought down a blush. &quot;I have no idea what
you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Misato patted her on the shoulder and slipped
out the hatch with a laugh.

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll need to see if we can get better
soundproofing in our suite,&quot; Maya blushed, taking a
break from pageant rehersals to be on the bridge.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Ritsuko agreed with a sigh.

Misato fought back a impish smile as she headed for
the elevator. She had been saving that little zinger
for just the right moment, and today was it. &#145;That
felt good,&#39; she thought as she hit the call button.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Valerie Moreau nodded respectfully amid the
small group of non-coms she was escorting with her
usual skill.

&quot;Any problems with the new batch?&quot; Misato asked
conversationally as they descended.

&quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; Val smiled.

&quot;Good to know,&quot; Misato smiled as they fell. A few
moments later she got off, pretending not to notice
the relieved sighs of several of the younger people.
&#145;Sometimes being captain is a bitch,&#39; she sighed as
she walked to her suite.

The smell of cooking food wafted by as Misato opened
the door and she smiled as she swiftly followed the
scent to the kitchen. &quot;Welcome home,&quot; Kaji smiled from
where he was making them stir fry.

&quot;This makes a iffy day just perfect,&quot; Misato grinned
as she kissed him. &quot;When did you get back aboard?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Snuck on for a visit on a MP chopter,&quot; Kaji admitted.
&quot;Dinner will be ready in a bit and a beer&#39;s on the
table.&quot;

&quot;Sucking up like this won&#39;t make up for you being a
jerk earlier,&quot; Misato warned as she went for her beer.

&quot;I think what I have in mind for desert will, tho,&quot;
Kaji said as he stirred dinner.
