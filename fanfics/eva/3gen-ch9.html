<h1>Third Genesis (part 9 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        They left the hospital quietly, all five considering what they 
had learned up in Shinji&#39;s room. Misato sighed softly, noting the sun 
beginning to fall behind the buildings, &quot;I could use a beer.&quot;

        &quot;How did I know you were going to say that,&quot; Ritsuko smirked.

        &quot;You do know me pretty well,&quot; Misato admitted with a slight 
smile. She noticed a neon sign advertising a bar and blinked, 
wondering how come she hadn&#39;t seen it before. &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that 
interesting,&quot; she murmured, pointing it out to the others.

        Almost as soon as Maya saw the glowing neon sign reading 
&#39;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&#39; she went oddly pale, something Ritsuko quickly 
noticed. She gently put her hand on the girl&#39;s arm and asked, &quot;Are you 
all right?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Maya blushed, looking down.

        &quot;Let&#39;s get a drink in there,&quot; a grinning Misato suggested.

        &quot;No!&quot; Maya blurted out. Everyone looked at her curiously, and 
the fiercely blushing woman said, &quot;It&#39;s a lesbian club. Some friends 
brought me here, right after I moved back to Tokyo.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Misato shrugged. She looked over at Asuka and 
Rei, &quot;Any problems?&quot;

        &quot;I guess not,&quot; Asuka said tentatively, while Rei shrugged.

        &quot;Ritsuko?&quot; Misato asked, a little smile on her face.

        Ritsuko felt Maya&#39;s eyes on her, and turned slightly to see 
Maya looking up at her hopefully. &quot;All right,&quot; she smiled.

        &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Misato lead the way.

        The dark haired door woman and bouncer gave them an quickly 
assessing glance before waving them on inside. They went down a dark 
hallway into a far larger room, probably converted from a warehouse. A 
bustling dance floor, dining tables, a busy bar, karaeoke stage and 
even a library were contained in the massive room.

        &quot;Hello,&quot; the brown haired woman who was oddly dressed in a 
school girl&#39;s uniform smiled up at them, &quot;welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s 
Locket.&quot;

        Misato took charge, &quot;Hi, this is our first time here.&quot;

        Hitomi noticed Maya standing in the background and smiled 
slightly, &quot;I think you&#39;ve visited before, haven&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, once,&quot; a blushing Maya blinked, a bit surprised at the 
girl&#39;s memory.

        &quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t come by again,&quot; Hitomi said teasingly, 
&quot;there were several young ladies asking about you the night after your 
visit.&quot;

        Maya, if it was possible, went an even brighter shade of red.

        &quot;We&#39;d better move on before she faints,&quot; Misato said with a 
laugh, leading the others deeper into the bar itself. &#39;Maya sure looks 
cute when she blushes like that,&#39; Misato thought, wondering if Ritsuko 
had noticed it too.

        &#39;God, Maya&#39;s cute,&#39; Ritsuko thought. It was strange, she had 
just thought that Maya&#39;s crush on her was a younger woman&#39;s 
idolization of her superior. But if Maya really was a lesbian, it shed 
a whole different light on the situation.

        &quot;Interesting,&quot; Rei noted, watching the women dancing together. 
She looked up at Asuka and softly asked her, &quot;Could we try that 
later?&quot;

        Asuka flushed. &#39;She doesn&#39;t understand quite what she&#39;s 
saying,&#39; she mused, watching two of the girls nearly making out there 
on the dance floor. Her voice just a bit strangled Asuka managed to 
get out, &quot;Sure.&quot;

        Misato watched the two of them together, and wondered if they 
were aware of the unconscious cues they were sending out. Even their 
clothes sent a strong message, Rei&#39;s more feminine dress and blouse 
along side Asuka&#39;s boyish long shirt and slacks.

        Pushing their way through the crowd at the bar, one of the two 
bartenders quickly made her way over. Both women were nearly alike, 
sexy blue haired young women, the only really differences being their 
clothing and the scars that one girl carried on each cheek.

        &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Ryouko. What can I get you folks?&quot; the unscarred 
woman asked coolly.

        &quot;Beer in a can,&quot; Misato smiled.

        &quot;Sake,&quot; Ritsuko ordered, quickly echoed by Maya.

        Asuka looked over at Rei thoughtfully, &quot;Two ginger ales, 
please.&quot;

        &quot;Here or at a table?&quot; Ryouko asked, and Ritsuko tentatively 
said table. With both speed and real grace Ryouko prepared a tray, two 
bottles of sake with cups, the can of beer, and two ginger ales in 
shining glasses. &quot;Hey, May! Help these folks get to a table!&quot;

        The tall, busty brown haired woman took up the tray and 
swiftly broke through the crowd, leaving a trail for them to follow. 
She brought them to a table and set the drinks down, never spilling a 
drop. &quot;If you want something to eat later,&quot; May beamed, &quot;just ask.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Maya smiled as the woman rushed off to serve 
someone else.

        Misato pulled out a seat and flopped down, popping her can of 
beer smoothly. She raised it to her lips and chugged before sighing, 
&quot;The nectar of life!&quot;

        Maya stepped up to one of the seats and pulled it out before 
smiling at Ritsuko, &quot;Would you care to sit down?&quot;

        Ritsuko hesitated a moment before smiling, &quot;I&#39;d be glad to.&quot; 
Maya pushed the seat in behind Ritsuko gently before taking her own 
right beside her.

        Asuka watched them with a slight smile before murmuring, &quot;When 
in Rome.&quot; She held a seat out for Rei, and the young woman sat down 
gracefully.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei gave Asuka another one of those gentle 
smiles.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Asuka smiled back before sitting down beside 
her.

        Misato gave them some time for the pouring of sake and sipping 
of drinks before saying, &quot;I hate to bring up business, but what&#39;s the 
status of the EVAs?&quot;

        &quot;EVA 00 is fully operational,&quot; Ritsuko said, &quot;and EVA 02 will 
be ready in a few days.&quot;

        &quot;That fast?&quot; Misato blinked in surprise.

        &quot;The crews have been getting their acts together,&quot; Ritsuko 
smiled slightly, &quot;and my assistant has been a great help getting the 
technical skills we needed.&quot;

        Maya blushed, &quot;It wasn&#39;t that much, sempai.&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes it was,&quot; Ritsuko exchanged a sly smile with Misato, 
&quot;that&#39;s why you&#39;re going to be getting promoted.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Maya squeaked.

        &quot;Congratulations,&quot; Asuka reached across to slap Maya on the 
back.

        Somewhat more hesitantly Rei did the same to her before 
quietly asking Asuka, &quot;Was that the right thing to do?&quot;

        &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Asuka agreed.

        Misato stood up and waved, quickly catching the attention of 
what initially looked like a young man dressed in a suit. It was only 
until she got nearer that the swell of breasts and a face too pretty 
to be a boy&#39;s became obvious. &quot;A round for the table on me,&quot; Misato 
grinned at her, &quot;in celebration of our friend&#39;s promotion!&quot;

        Keiko smiled, &quot;Coming right up!&quot; She was back in moments, 
carrying a tray of fresh drinks for them all and a cupcake with a 
candle in it. At their questioning looks she shrugged, &quot;Sasami sent it 
out, for the celebration.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ritsuko smiled, setting the cupcake in front of 
Maya.

        As Ritsuko encouraged Maya to blow the candle out in the 
background Misato asked Rei and Asuka, &quot;How are things going on the 
simulators?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m wining,&quot; was Rei&#39;s deadpan answer.

        &quot;When we&#39;ve practiced together we work remarkably well,&quot; Asuka 
elaborated, &quot;I think our coordination may even beat what I achieved 
with Shinji.&quot;

        &quot;Good to know,&quot; Misato sat back with a sigh, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
we&#39;ll need to mobilize the EVAs any time soon, but we should be 
ready.&quot;

        &quot;We will be,&quot; Asuka vowed softly.

        A slower song had come on, and Rei gently tugged on Asuka&#39;s 
shirt before nodding to the dance floor, &quot;Do you think we could try?&quot;

        Asuka gulped softly, &quot;All right.&quot;

        The two young women slid out of their chairs and stepped out 
onto the dance floor together. They danced awkwardly to start with, 
but they quickly found their rhythm. Rei was cradled close in Asuka&#39;s 
arms, her stance both protective and romantic, somehow.

        Misato watched Maya and Ritsuko watching the two of them 
enviously, hoping they might take a hint. &quot;Why don&#39;t you to take a 
turn out there?&quot; Misato finally had to suggest quietly, &quot;In honor of 
Maya&#39;s promotion, maybe.&quot;

        Maya rose from her seat, &quot;May I have this dance?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Ritsuko took the hand, letting herself be pulled out 
into the dance.

        Once they were gone Misato had to shake her head at the 
general denseness of all concerned before muttering, &quot;Baka.&quot;.
