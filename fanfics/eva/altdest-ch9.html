<h1>Altered Destinies (part 9 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Ritsuko Akagi&#39;s fingers seemed to fly across the two
terminals as she worked away, the dyed blonde looking
back and forth between the screens with data streaming
by on both. Switching over to one hand she reached out
and grabbed her cup of coffee and took a long drink,
not really noticing that it had gone stone cold.

&quot;Dr. Akagi?&quot; Maya asked softly, the brown haired young
woman walking in to the room to stand respectfully to
one side, carrying in a set of reports.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ritsuko didn&#39;t look away from her work,
but her voice was gentle as she welcomed her in.

&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot; Maya asked
curiously as the boyish young woman set the documents
and disks down.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Ritsuko smiled, &quot;just finishing up some
programming for the Unit 00 reactivation tests. I
shouldn&#39;t be long.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Maya lingered for a moment, then
reluctantly left.

After working a few minutes more Ritsuko finished up,
logging out of the program then removing a disk from
the drive, slipping it into a protective carrier and
putting it in her white labcoat&#39;s pocket. Pressing a
key on the terminal sent another command out, this
time going to the complex&#39;s security system.

&#39;That&#39;ll stop Gendo from seeing the looped images I
recorded of me working away,&#39; a smiling Ritsuko
thought as she stretched tiredly, &#39;rather than what I
was really doing. Thank goodness Maya didn&#39;t insist on
staying.&#39;

Just like every other day Ritsuko made her way over to
the elevators, rising up from the underground facility
of NERV to the surface, then on to the commuter train
out to the apartment that she and Misato lived in. She
went inside, reaching to flip on the lights then
Ritsuko smiled as she felt a familiar presence inside.

&quot;Is that you, love?&quot; Misato called out. She looked up
in greeting from where she sat at the dining room
table, the black haired woman casually sorting their
mail.

&quot;Hi, love,&quot; Ritsuko answered. Gesturing Misato to
silence she crossed to the kitchen and took a small
device from where they had hidden it, activating a
switch and instantly shutting down any bugs within one
hundred feet.

&quot;Is that necessary?&quot; Misato blinked in alarm.

Ritsuko took the disks out of her pocket as she said
to her excitedly, &quot;I think I&#39;ve got it, or at least
some of it.&quot;

Hearing that Misato got up, her eyes narrowed in
thought. &quot;Then we&#39;d better check it out,&quot; she said
seriously.

&quot;Lets,&quot; Ritsuko agreed and both women headed to the
computer they kept in the bedroom. &quot;I downloaded the
entirety of one of Gendo&#39;s private memory archives,&quot;
she revealed, &quot;but other than that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s
in it.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe the man is hiding his secure files on
the Magi,&quot; Misato said as she led the way into their
bedroom.

Ritsuko activated the computer, waiting a moment for
it to start up before sliding the disks in. Mildly she
said, &quot;Considering the pure volume of data in the Magi
he probably figured that no one would be able to find
the archive.&quot;

Antivirus and decryption programs activated, scanning
the content of the disk and going to work. &quot;And he
doesn&#39;t know that we&#39;re trying to find out what&#39;s
really going on,&quot; Misato added quietly. She looked at
Ritsuko fondly, &quot;What convinced you to listen to Kaji,
by the way?&quot;

Ritsuko tapped the keyboard, unleashing a second
series of decryption systems. &quot;Probably getting a look
at the real budget,&quot; she confessed, &quot;and seeing the
sheer amount of money and resources he&#39;s plugging into
black projects with no one overseeing him.&quot;

&quot;I still remember the first time you showed me Adam,&quot;
Misato murmured thoughtfully as they waited for the
computer to finish, &quot;seeing that thing impaled on the
cross beneath NERV... it felt like my blood ran cold.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Ritsuko agreed grimly.

There was a soft chime as the programs finished their
work and both women leaned forward as the archive
opened automatically. A series of pop-up windows
appeared on the screen, each one for a different
section of the archive, and they began to scan them
intently.

&quot;His personal journal,&quot; Misato noted, &quot;a report to or
from something called SEELE and private correspondence
between Gendo and Fuyutsuki.&quot;

&quot;Which do you want to look at first?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;The journal,&quot; Misato said after a moment&#39;s thought,
&quot;if he really thinks it&#39;s private he might spill
something important.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Ritsuko clicked on the journal, the two
quickly scanning it. Much of the entries were things
they already knew, including the development of the
Evangelion Units and the various negotiations involved
with NERV, but there were interesting details imbedded
in there.

Misato blinked as a very personal reference smacked
her between the eyes, &quot;Gendo tried to get you to sleep
with him?&quot;

&quot;I did tell you about it,&quot; Ritsuko said mildly.

&quot;Maybe, but it&#39;s extremely creepy reading it from his
point of view,&quot; Misato growled out. She scowled, &quot;That
slimy little...&quot;

Ritsuko gently put her hand on her lover&#39;s arm, &quot;Trust
me love, you have nothing to worry about.&quot; A smile,
&quot;Even if I wasn&#39;t committed to you, knowing he had
slept with my mom too would have put me off.&quot;

&quot;Creep,&quot; Misato nodded. Her eyes widened as she read a
passage, &quot;Gendo ordered the sabotage of the JA
prototype?&quot;

Ritsuko nodded thoughtfully, &quot;They never could explain
why that robot went out of control during the test...
or why the reactor overloaded.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot; Misato asked, &quot;The machine was clunky, even
if they could have gotten it operational it couldn&#39;t
match Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but I doubt Gendo would take the chance,&quot;
Ritsuko sighed.

&quot;Guess you&#39;re right,&quot; Misato agreed.

Choosing to close the journal for now they scanned the
file on SEELE, but neither could make heads or tails
of the rambling document. &quot;What is the Alternate?&quot;
Ritsuko pointed to one passage where it almost seemed
like Gendo was arguing with the mysterious person or
group, &quot;And why do they need Adam&#39;s DNA for?&quot;

&quot;Do you really expect me to answer that?&quot; Misato
blinked, sitting back and rubbing her eyes.

&quot;We know Rei has Adam&#39;s DNA...&quot; Ritsuko mused. Her
eyes narrowed, &quot;Are they trying to create another
clone?&quot;

&quot;Why,&quot; Misato asked, &quot;we already have Rei?&quot; She
chuckled humorlessly, &quot;Hell, we have a bin full of
them in the basement.&quot;

Ritsuko made a face, &quot;Part of Gendo&#39;s damn dummy plug
project.&quot; She shook her head firmly and got back on
topic, &quot;Maybe creating a clone for a new purpose? They
could be trying to communicate with the Angels.&quot;

&quot;Would be nice to know why they&#39;re attacking,&quot; Misato
conceded.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s see what the professor has to say,&quot;
Ritsuko murmured as she clicked the mouse on the third
window.

Just then they heard the door open and Shinji call
out, &quot;I&#39;m home!&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; Misato quickly closed the windows and popped
out the disk.

Ritsuko quickly concealed the disk then she and Misato
hurried out of the bedroom just as Shinji came around
the corner. A faint blush colored the young woman&#39;s
face, &quot;Uhm, if you want I can go out for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ritsuko blinked.

Misato chuckled faintly as she realized what sort of
assumption Shinji had come to. &quot;Not today,&quot; she
smiled, &quot;but I may ask later.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Shinji headed into her room.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Ritsuko frowned, most of her
mind still occupied with what they had been reading.

Misato laughed, &quot;I think Shinji believes she
interrupted us in the act, so to speak.&quot;</pre>
