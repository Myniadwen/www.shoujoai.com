<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ballad of Fallen Angels (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessierae.html">Jessie-Rae</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/ballad-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Kira sat in her room staring Blankley at the wall; she had nothing to do 
now. She had neatly placed her things in drawers and cupboards and her 
room was tidy already. She had nothing to distract her from the pain 
that lurked just beneath the surface. 

[Flashback]

&#147;Kira, I&#146;ll miss you, you know,&#148; Laura said snuggling closer to her 
blonde companion as they stared blissfully at the stars. Kira sighed.

&#147;Listen, don&#146;t take this the wrong way but I really don&#146;t wanna talk 
about it,&#148; she said flatly Laura frowned and sat up straight staring 
directly into Kira&#146;s emerald eyes.

&#147;You should talk about it. Hiding from the truth won&#146;t get you anywhere. 
Think of it as a learning experience, you&#146;ll meet new people and you&#146;ll 
be in a foreign land. I couldn&#146;t think of anything more exiting,&#148; Laura 
said enthusiastically, doing anything in her power to bring a smile back 
to her lover&#146;s sullen face. 

&#147;But I won&#146;t be able to see you . . . and I don&#146;t want to pilot an Eva, 
I can&#146;t pilot an Eva,&#148; Kira said hotly, tears beginning there decent 
down her face, Laura smiled sympathetically and drew her lover close, 
letting her cry on her shoulder.

&#147;You should be proud Kira, you were the best. You are the best, you have 
to be the pilot,&#148; she said softly, kissing Kira&#146;s head for reassurance. 

&#147;Maybe you could come with me,&#148; Kira suggested hopefully, Laura shook 
her head.

&#147;There&#146;s no way I could afford it . . . and besides, this is your 
battle, you have to face it yourself. I can&#146;t be there to catch you 
every time you fall, no matter how much I would like to,&#148; she said 
slowly, making sure Kira understood everything, &#147;I&#146;m sorry to have 
brought it up,&#148; she finally said Kira raised her head and gently brushed 
her lips against Laura&#146;s, who without hesitation, deepened the kiss, 
holding on to Kira with all her strength. 

&#147;I love you,&#148; Kira whispered and pulled Laura into a gentle embrace. 


&#147;We&#146;re home!&#148; Maya called, Kira was ripped out of her reverie.

&#147;Ok,&#148; she replied and exited her room, how long had she been sitting in 
her room doing nothing she wondered as she padded out into the main living area.      

&#147;Hello again Asuka,&#148; Kira said smiling broadly, flashing her pearly 
whites in such a manner as to make the red head blush. 

&#147;Good evening, so what did you end up doing for the rest of the day?&#148; 
she asked conversationally. Kira looked blank for a few moments.

&#147;I guess I fell asleep,&#148; she said slowly, trying to convince herself 
that the statement was true. Asuka grinned.

&#147;Well it sounds a lot better than what I did,  I can&#146;t believe how much 
of a slave driver you are Maya, I&#146;ve had more work today than I have in 
the past three weeks,&#148; she said folding her arms and making a noise that 
closely resembled *humph*

Maya rolled her eyes.

&#147;Some habits never die,&#148; she grumbled under her breath Asuka turned and 
frowned slightly.

&#147;I head that,&#148; she said, Kira decided that it was time for her to leave; 
the look on Asuka&#146;s face was one of fury. She walked over to the lounge 
room and sat on the floor by the low coffee table. After a remarkably 
short amount of bickering Asuka sat beside Kira and flipped her hair 
behind her back.

&#147;So Kira, what made you decide to pilot an Eva?&#148; Asuka asked enquiringly 
Kira looked down for a moment then looked back up again.

&#147;Well, it wasn&#146;t entirely my choice, I was sitting in my lectures one 
day and a tall man walked in and asked to talk with me, I was taken to 
headquarters where my dad worked. Then one of the scientists sat me down 
and told me that I was a natural candidate to pilot an Evangelion, 
naturally I was shocked, but they put me through training and I sort of 
got used to it I guess,&#148; she said nonchalantly, Asuka smiled, she 
couldn&#146;t get over how much she sounded like Shinji, maybe not quite as 
reluctant though.

&#147;At least you had a say in the matter and you can&#146;t ask for more than 
that,&#148; Asuka said confidently, Maya walked over and sat with the two 
girls. 

&#147;You&#146;re right about that,&#148; Kira said softly. 


Asuka and Maya lay in bed, cuddled up together and staring out the 
window. 

&#147;I like her,&#148; Asuka said, referring to the sixth child, Maya shuffled 
slightly and yawned.

&#147;Yea, she&#146;s quite the character,&#148; she agreed.

&#147;But will she be able to handle the Eva?&#148; Asuka asked Maya gently kissed 
Asuka&#146;s neck, Asuka moaned and turned around, frowning slightly.

&#147;I&#146;m serious,&#148; she said Maya sighed.

&#147;I think she will be fine,&#148; she said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry yourself to much ok, 
now go to seep,&#148; she said giving Asuka a quick kiss on the cheek.

&#147;Alright, I suppose we&#146;ll find out tomorrow,&#148; Asuka said and with that 
she fell asleep.   


Kira couldn&#146;t sleep, no matter how much she wanted to. She felt as 
though she&#146;d slept long enough and now she was wide-awake. 

[Flashback]

&#147;Kira, be careful won&#146;t you?&#148; Laura asked tearfully as Kira was 
preparing to board her flight, Kira smiled gently and stroked a strand 
of hair behind Laura&#146;s ear. 

&#147;I&#146;ll be fine, and you know it,&#148; She said, her voice shaky as tears 
threatened to spill, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small 
velvet box.

&#147;Here,&#148; she said handing it to Laura, &#147;I bought this for you awhile ago, 
I was going to ask but I never found the right way to say it,&#148; Kira said 
hiding her eyes in shame. Laura burst into a fresh bout of tears and 
threw herself into Kira&#146;s arms. 

&#147;I love you so much,&#148; Laura sobbed. 

&#147;Flight 32 to Tokyo-3 Japan will start boarding passengers for first 
class only. I repeat. Flight 32 destined for Tokyo-3 Japan will start 
boarding passengers for first class only.&#148;

Kira sighed and let her girlfriend go.

&#147;I guess this is it . . . I won&#146;t be seeing you for awhile,&#148; Kira said 
sadly, &#147;But I&#146;ll write, and I&#146;ll call you too, I-I, I love you Laura,&#148; 
she whispered Laura smiled through her tears and hugged her love one 
last time. Kira turned and walked towards the door of the gate, she 
turned and waved one last time then she was gone.


[Now]

Kira walked over to her guitar and undid the buckles; she carefully 
pulled it out and sat down, just revelling in the feel of the fine 
wooden instrument in her hands. She gave it a quick tune, and then 
started playing. It was a little song that Aura had composed for Kira 
for their anniversary, and Kira really loved to play it as well as hear 
it. She played the song through a few times before she placed it down 
and went to sleep. Asuka who had woken up to use the bathroom was 
standing outside her door, she had just heard the song and had been 
moved to tears, the song held such depth and emotion that Asuka felt she 
had no part of but none the less found it beautiful, she sighed and 
wiped away her tears before returning to her lovers warm embrace.


Kira woke up to the smell of fresh coffee being brewed and the sound of 
tinkering in the kitchen. She stood slowly and padded out into the 
kitchen.

&#147;Good morning Kira,&#148; Maya said cheerfully, &#147;Are you ready for your big 
debut?&#148; she asked, Kira looked confused.

&#147;Umm, what debut?&#148; she asked confusedly.

&#147;You have your first synch test today, but I have something to show you 
before you go,&#148; Maya said proudly, &#147;You get to see your Eva today,&#148;

&#147;Hey, where&#146;s Asuka?&#148; Kira asked.

&#147;She&#146;s still asleep, she has the morning of today, but she&#146;ll be by to 
see you later on don&#146;t worry,&#148; Maya answered, &#147;How was your sleep?&#148; she 
asked kindly Kira shrugged.

&#147;It took awhile, but it was fine once I got to sleep,&#148; she said, &#147;So, 
what&#146;s for breakfast?&#148;


Later on that day Maya was driving Kira to headquarters.

&#147;Are you nervous?&#148; she asked Kira shrugged.

&#147;I don&#146;t think there&#146;s anything to be worried about, but I guess I&#146;m 
anxious to see the Eva,&#148; Kira said quietly, &#147;Is there anything to be 
worried about?&#148; she asked smirking Maya blushed.

&#147;Of course not, you&#146;re in the best of hands,&#148; she said confidently.

&#147;Ok then,&#148; Kira said softly, she had no intention of continuing the 
conversation, she was quite content to just sit and listen to the 
silence, it was soothing and gave her time to think. When she thought 
about it, she had just been rushed into all of this, but it was better 
than letting it drag out she decided.


They walked into what Maya called the cage and stood before the Eva. It 
truly was a site to behold, it was as large as a tall building and its 
primary colour was black, with red and blue trimmings here and there.

&#147;This is Evangelion Unit 00, the final production model,&#148; Maya said 
proudly, Kira smiled half heartedly, she still did not feel confident 
with her abilities, what if she wasn&#146;t good enough? Would they send her 
home? That wouldn&#146;t be too bad, at least she would be with Laura, and 
her life would feel complete again.

&#147;Head to the change rooms and suite up,&#148; Maya said handing Kira an 
airtight packet, &#147;Then meet me back here when you&#146;re done . . . and 
don&#146;t worry, you&#146;ll be fine,&#148; she said reassuringly, Kira took the 
packet and walked off in the direction Maya had shown her previously.       

The change rooms were large and empty, her footsteps echoed and bounced 
off the walls. Kira sighed and unwrapped her plastic package and out 
came her plug suit. She undressed slowly, putting all her clothes into a 
duffle bag then into a locker, now it was time for the suite, and it 
looked pretty big; maybe it wouldn&#146;t fit her

She stepped inside of it and zipped it up at the front, she was right in 
her assumption, it was too big, and then she noticed a small button on 
her right wrist. Her suit then shrank to her body size. 

It felt . . . agreeable, like a second skin, in fact it was quite 
comfortable if she didn&#146;t know she was wearing it she could have sworn 
she was still naked. She took a deep breath and exited the change rooms 
and back in the direction were Maya would be waiting.

When Kira walked with view of Maya she gulped, all of Kira&#146;s assets were 
set proudly on display; Kira caught Maya&#146;s expression and laughed 
jokingly.

&#147;Stop staring, it&#146;s not polite,&#148; 

&#147;Sorry,&#148; Maya said, her blush spreading. 


Kira sat in the entry plug waiting for something to happen, the plug 
began to fill with LCL she took deep gulps of it until it filled her 
lungs, she could now breath again. 

&#147;Alright Kira, this is Asuka, are you ready?&#148; Asuka asked through 
communications, Kira gave her a cocky smile and winked.

&#147;Bring it on,&#148; she said confidently, her surroundings changed numerous 
amounts of times before she was able to see the room that the entry plug 
was in, it was a large room filled with water. Kira sat back comfortably 
and closed her eyes; this wasn&#146;t as hard as she thought it would be.


&#147;Synch ratio 76%,&#148; Asuka said calmly Maya beamed.

&#147;That&#146;s incredible, are you sure this is her first time in an entry 
plug?&#148; she asked excitedly Asuka turned around and rolled her eyes.

&#147;Of course it is, you read the reports,&#148; she stated flatly Maya 
shrugged.

&#147;Yea, I know . . . lower the depth another .5 metres,&#148; Maya said, all 
business once more. 

&#147;Synch ratio 89% and still rising,&#148; Asuka said, &#147;This is unbelievable, 
she&#146;s a natural,&#148; Asuka said proudly Maya nodded.

&#147;Lower the entry plug until her ratio stops rising,&#148; she said and took a 
seat beside Asuka her hand resting on her shoulder as she leaned forward 
to view the screen.

&#147;How are you feeling Kira?&#148; she asked there was silence for a moment and 
then.

&#147;I don&#146;t think I&#146;ve ever felt more relaxed in my life,&#148; Kira answered 
honestly, Maya smiled.

&#147;Synch ratio has stopped at 93%, that&#146;s incredible Maya, they really 
picked well this time,&#148; Asuka said leaning back in her chair.

&#147;Alright then, that&#146;s enough for today . . . Kira, you&#146;re done now,&#148; 
Maya said softly, &#147;Well done Kira,&#148; 

That&#146;s when the alarms went off.

&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148; Maya shouted.

&#147;An unknown object has made itself present just outside the Tokyo-2 
region,&#148; one of the technicians replied, &#147;Its blood pattern is green 
ma&#146;am, we have no idea what it is,&#148; 

Maya looked at Asuka for any sign of what to do next, Asuka shrugged.

&#147;Hey it&#146;s your call, I&#146;m jut your techie remember,&#148; she said Maya took a 
deep breath.

&#147;Launch the Eva, it&#146;s the only thing we can do.&#148; 


A/N

this chapter was pretty short for two reasons, one: I&#39;m having a bit of 
trouble with the story. and Two: it&#39;s how I thought the story should go, 
just short introductions for charcaters and what not, then the serious 
stuff. 

I hope you enjoyed it!
