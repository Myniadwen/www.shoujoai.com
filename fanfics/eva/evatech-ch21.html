<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 21 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Hikaru Horaki raced through the fireball of a
exploding enemy craft, guns blazing as her wingmen
followed her in. &quot;Aida, cover left,&quot; she ordered them,
&quot;Kyle to the right!&quot;

&quot;Aye aye,&quot; Lynn Kyle answered crisply, Aida silently
obeying as they accelerated towards the waves of enemy
fighters and cruisers. The ships had appeared on
scanners descending from the Zentradi fleet in orbit,
the few space defenses that Earth had barely slowing
them down. In response the SDF-1 had launched all of
the on-duty fighter teams and was holding other
volunteers in reserve, just in case things got nasty.

&#39;I hope this guy is as good as he seems,&#39; Hikaru found
herself thinking as the wings of Evangelion fighters
peeled off to their assigned positions. Kyle had only
just been assigned to the ship yesterday, for gods
sake, but they needed Toji&#39;s spot filled.... Her heart
lurched in her chest as she thought of Toji, then she
ruthlessly pushed it away.

Aida launched missiles, picking off another battlepod
as they raced forward to intercept a group of enemy
forces. &quot;I don&#39;t see the enemy Angels,&quot; he reported,
shifting his fighter to EVA mode, a humanoid robot
with a dangerous looking cannon.

&quot;There are officers pods though,&quot; Kyle warned, the
young man following Aida&#39;s lead, &quot;we&#39;d better be
careful.&quot;

&quot;Those are words to the wise, boys,&quot; Hikari grimly
agreed, the three of them laying down streams of high
velocity fire as they bobbed and weaved through enemy
attacks even as she watched Kyle fighting
thoughtfully.

Kyle battled the enemy with precision rather than
force, pumping out just enough of his precious fire
power into each foe, yet seemingly aware of the whole
battle around him. With just small bursts of thrust he
dodged all enemy attacks without bothering his aim,
cutting down the pods with almost frightening ease.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Aida murmured over the radio to her
privately, &quot;he is good.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;d better be,&quot; Hikari growled as she saw another
wave, &quot;incoming!&quot;

Then, off in the distance they saw a disturbance in
the enemy ranks, a rapidly spreading wave of
fireballing craft as something tore through them
ruthlessly. Then they reached them, three familiar
fighters: Skull One, Asuka&#39;s Red and Shinji&#39;s Blue
trimmed planes, the fighter pilots who had come to be
known as the Angels of Death.

&quot;Holy crap,&quot; Kyle murmured in awe as they swept by
him, only leaving the flaming wrecks of dead
battlepods in their wake.

Across the way, following the fighter wings in his
officer&#39;s pod Khyron the backstabber smiled ferally as
they drove forward towards the enemy. The Micronians
were fierce, worthy foes for the glorious Zentradi
armada, and he was looking forward to the coming
battle.

&quot;Lord Breetai is hailing you,&quot; Khyron heard his
lieutenant repeat it tentatively and the commander
grit his teeth.

Keeping his tone falsely pleasant Khyron smiled as the
familiar face appeared on his viewscreen, &quot;Yes,
m&#39;lord?&quot;

Neither of them were fooled by their good manners, of
course. Khyron knew that Breetai wanted him dead,,
even as Breetai was well aware that the younger man
was ambitious, dreaming of taking his role. Ideally by
striding over his still warm corpse, of course.

&quot;The enemy&#39;s aces have joined combat,&quot; Breetai
informed him, &quot;as we expected. Destroy them, Khyron,
for the glory of the Zentradi.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Khyron smiled, bowing exageratedly in his
seat.

&quot;Follow the plan, Khyron,&quot; Breetai warned him coldly,
the light shining ominously off of his metallic cowl,
&quot;you would not want to see the consequences if you
don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Khyron snarled then cut the connection.

&quot;M&#39;lord?&quot; his lieutenant asked warily from his nearby
battlepod.

&quot;Deploy the pods to screen the cruiser as we
discussed,&quot; Khyron bit out. Connecting to the cruisers
he gave the order, &quot;Best speed to Zor&#39;s fortress,
we&#39;re going to ram them.&quot;

&quot;Aye, lord,&quot; the pilot gave him a mad grin.

&#39;He&#39;s not wound too tight,&#39; Khyron noted with
amusement, though in truth much of his attacking force
was similar. Breetai used his unit for disposing of
those officers that.. shall we say were discipline
problems? Still, Khyron found such rabble useful, for
they feared little even the Angels of Death
themselves.

As their pods raced towards fire and death Khyron
smiled, &quot;Today is a good day to die.&quot;

Maneuvering through the enemy ranks and cutting pods
down left and right Asuka Langley was glad her helmet
kept her orange hair out of her eyes or else the sweat
would have plastered it to her face. &#39;Are they
throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink today?&#39;
she thought irritably, squeezing the trigger to scrag
another battlepod.

Her view screen lit up to reveal Maya Ibuki, staring
out at her calmly from her place at the bridge. &quot;The
two cruisers are moving on a direct collision course
with the SDF-1,&quot; she informed her calmly, &quot;and there&#39;s
too many of our own fighters out there to use the main
gun.&quot;

&quot;What about the Deadelus maneuver?&quot; Asuka asked
tersely, zipping through a exploding pod, shifting to
EVA mode and hovering among them as she mowed down
multiple pods. She was referring to using the ship
mounted as a &#39;arm&#39; of the SDF-1 and ramming it into a
enemy craft before unleashing a wave of missiles.

&quot;We&#39;ll use it if needed,&quot; Maya said, &quot;but stop them if
you can.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Asuka nodded then shifted over to
communication between fighters, &quot;Rei, Shinji, form up
on me.&quot;

The two fighters slid into place beside her, then
Asuka&#39;s view screen lit up. &quot;How do we reach the
cruisers quickly enough through the fighter screen?&quot;
Rei asked calmly, yet her eyes showed tenderness as
she gazed at Asuka.

Shinji came on, the black haired young man smiling
grimly. &quot;I can get some pilots together and plow the
road,&quot; he offered, &quot;I know Hikari and her team are out
here.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s an officer pod out there,&quot; Asuka cautioned
him, &quot;can you handle him while we disable the
cruiser?&quot;

Shinji gave her a look, &quot;Of course.&quot;

Asuka flashed a grin, &quot;Good luck.&quot;

Shinji smoothly peeled off, forming up a wedge with
Hikari and several other wings, the group racing
forward to tear into the screen of battlepods, burning
a hole in their ranks. Asuka and Rei darted forward to
the cruisers, dodging and weaving through tracer fire
till they reached the bumpy green surface of the
vessels.

Sensor ports, weapons, critical vents all fell to the
twin pilots&#39; guns, the skin of the ships dancing with
explosions. They darted away from the vessels then
swung around, flights of missiles soaring in to the
less armored and vulnerable engines, more explosions
blossoming there. Reactors went as energy backlashed,
explosions growing within each vessel, then they each
went up in a blast of light and fire.

&quot;No!&quot; Khyron cried out his fury, racing forward with
the officers&#39; pod heavy arm cannons coming up to blast
at the two of them. He snarled rage as they danced
away from his shots, moving like some phantom across
the blue skies, their own weapons unable to penetrate
his armor. Then, luckily, a shot landed.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Asuka growled as her Evangelion spun,
gyroscopes off line and her stomach heaving. Quickly
she trigged the transformation, the EVA mode
stabilizing the plane&#39;s systems as boot thrusters
slowed her fall.

With an inarticulate cry Rei raced in, the blue haired
girl&#39;s red eyes glowing like some kind of demon as she
attacked. Using a unearthly speed she zipped around
him peppering the pod with fire, dodging in and out as
Khyron helplessly tried to strike back.

Tasting blood in her mouth Asuka followed her in,
using her fellow pilot as a distraction. Slipping
underneath the flying pod she opened up at the
junction where the main pod met the leg units,
emptying a chain of high density slugs there. The pod
jerked wildly, the armor stressed to it&#39;s limits, then
she finally broke through.

BOOM!

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rei demanded as she swiftly flew
to Asuka&#39;s side.

&quot;Banged up and I bit the inside of my mouth,&quot; Asuka
confessed, &quot;but yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;

The remaining pods swiftly broke off, the scattered
survivors racing back to the safety of their fleet.
The Evangelion pilots were too tired to chase after
them, feeling satisfied that they had broken off the
attempt to attack the ship.

&quot;Hey, I thought I was supposed to get the officer&#39;s
pod,&quot; Shinji gently complained as he returned to the
wing.

&quot;We&#39;ll let you have it next time,&quot; Rei said deadpan.</pre>
