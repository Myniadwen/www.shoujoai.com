<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 18 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Minmei carried another serving of food over to the
table, casually setting the trays out as she flashed a
smile at Shinji. &quot;Is there anything else I can get
you?&quot; the black haired young woman asked the table
full of pilots.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hikari murmured, her brown haired tied
back, &quot;we&#39;re fine.&quot;

Over at the other table a female voice growled out,
&quot;Watch the hands!&quot;

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Minmei rushed over to the other table to find
Aida looking stunned as the green haired young woman
pinned him against the wall, her eyes flashing,
&quot;Miriya, let him go,&quot; Minmei said patiently.

Miriya hesitated, then stepped away. &quot;He grabbed me on
the bottom,&quot; she glared at the blonde haired boy
coldly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to,&quot; Aida protested weakly.

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Minmei scolded him.

Shinji Ikari shook his head with a sigh, his black
hair falling into his eyes as he followed her over.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he gave Minmei a wry smile. He dropped his
voice a bit to ask her, &quot;When did Miriya start doing
part time here?&quot;

&quot;She wanted to pay back my aunt,&quot; Minmei answered
quietly. A slight smile teased her lips, &quot;She&#39;s quite
popular because she&#39;s so tough.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Asuka blinked, having been eagerly listening in
to the conversation.

Minmei chuckled, &quot;All the guys seem to have decided
she&#39;s a challenge.&quot;

&quot;Dog,&quot; Miriya growled to a customer up by the front
counter, &quot;sit down and be silent, or you will face my
wrath!&quot; The diner stopped trying to chat her up, sat
down and timidly ate his meal.

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; Minmei shrugged.

&quot;Aida, you all right?&quot; Shinji asked him curiously.

&quot;What a woman,&quot; Aida sighed, rubbing at his throat.

&quot;What a fool,&quot; Rei murmured calmly, eating her food
steadily.

Asuka smiled at Rei impishly. &quot;We&#39;ll stick around for
the wake,&quot; she said softly, &quot;then head back home
together.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still a little surprised that we&#39;re having a
party,&quot; Rei admitted.

&quot;Not exactly a party,&quot; Asuka mused, &quot;more of a
celebration of Toji&#39;s life, I think.&quot; She looked back
at the morose Hikari, &quot;Though I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be
celebrating anything for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Some more sake, please,&quot; Hikari yelled, nodding
approvingly as Miriya brought her another of the small
bottles.

Maya Ibuki sat up by the front counter, sipping sake
and watching the party from a distance. Her black hair
was messier than normal, her uniform more than a
little wrinkled. The eyes that were normally so clear
were now red rimmed from tears.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; the quiet voice came from
behind her. Ritsuko Akagi sat down beside her,
ordering a drink and a small meal. A battered overcoat
was over her uniform, and she too had a tired, almost
exhausted look on her face.

&quot;I should have given the warning sooner,&quot; Maya said
quietly.

&quot;Gendo was still trying to figure out what was
happening with the barrier system,&quot; Ritsuko answered,
&quot;there was no way you could have known.&quot; Her voice
turned bitter, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have agreed to activating
the system in the first place.&quot;

&quot;All of Gendo&#39;s test data was good,&quot; Maya pointed out
tiredly, &quot;there was no way that you could have known.&quot;

&quot;And yet here we are blaming ourselves,&quot; Ritsuko
sighed. She tossed back a saucer of sake, &quot;The burdens
of command, I suppose, hindsight is always
twenty-twenty.&quot;

&quot;So what happens now?&quot; Maya asked.

Ritsuko looked off in the distance, her expression
carefully blank. &quot;I got the heads up from a friend in
Earth HQ,&quot; she finally said, &quot;we&#39;re being exiled.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Maya asked softly.

Ritsuko smiled grimly, an expression entirely without
humor. &quot;We were a political embarrassment already with
our return from space with an island of officially
dead civilians aboard,&quot; she quietly explained.

&quot;And the barrier explosion finished it?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;It&#39;s considered too dangerous to have us on Earth,&quot;
Ritsuko reported bleakly, &quot;I think the Captain will be
getting the official orders in a few days.&quot;

&quot;Misato,&quot; Maya sighed sadly, thinking of their black
haired leader, the intense, driven woman who had
shepherded them home from the edge of the solar system
to here. &quot;Is she going to be all right?&quot; she asked
softly.

&quot;Last time I checked,&quot; Ritsuko sighed, &quot;Misato took a
few beers home, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll let herself
get too drunk.&quot;

In the background several of the pilots had begun to
exchange funny stories about Toji. The young pilot
seemed to have been well loved by his fellows, even
though more often than not he was a bit of a short
tempered screw up.

&quot;How long have you known the captain?&quot; Maya asked
Ritsuko curiously, taking another drink of her sake.

Ritsuko turned, blonde hair falling into her eyes. &quot;We
met in college,&quot; she revealed, &quot;and were even
roommates together.&quot;

Maya felt a surprising flash of jealousy. &quot;Roommates?&quot;
she echoed.

Ritsuko chuckled softly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she reassured
her girlfriend gently, &quot;Misato was way too busy
chasing boys to be worried about me.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Maya blushed cutely under Ritsuko&#39;s warmly
amused gaze. &quot;What was she like, anyway?&quot; she found
herself asking.

&quot;Busy screwing everything with two legs,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s
eyes twinkled. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised how often I came
home to find the &#39;do not disturb&#39; sign on out door...&quot;

Behind them another pilot was regaling the group with
the time in basic training where Toji had taken a bet
to sneak into the girl&#39;s showers and steal panties. Of
course he was caught and the whole squad had pretty
much taken revenge on him.

&quot;So what did you do?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;I usually found a willing lady to let me share her
room,&quot; Ritsuko confessed. &quot;I pretty much used
university to sow my wild oats.&quot;

Maya blushed faintly, &quot;Me, too.&quot; At Ritsuko&#39;s curious
glance she explained, &quot;I had a girlfriend or two and
joined the gaysoc.&quot;

&quot;That was wild?&quot; Ritsuko raised an eyebrow.

&quot;It was for me,&quot; Maya answered honestly.

Ritsuko chuckled softly. They sat there a bit,
listening to the stories and conversation, then she
sighed, &quot;I&#39;m not looking forward to reassigning the
pilots after all this.&quot;

&quot;Hikari won&#39;t be happy about having a new wingman,&quot;
Maya agreed glumly. &quot;Do you think we should break that
wing up?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Ritsuko said forcefully, &quot;not unless they
request it, anyway.&quot;

Maya nodded her agreement. &quot;It would be like breaking
up the Angels of Death,&quot; she nodded to Rei, Asuka and
Shinji.

&quot;Not quite that bad,&quot; Ritsuko smiled faintly.

Hesitantly Maya looked up at Ritsuko, &quot;I don&#39;t...&quot; she
paused, &quot;want to be alone tonight.&quot;

Ritsuko slid her hand over to cover Maya&#39;s, squeezing
it comfortingly. &quot;Me, too,&quot; was all the answer she
needed to give.</pre>
