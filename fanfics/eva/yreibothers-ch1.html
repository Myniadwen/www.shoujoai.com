<h1>Why Rei Bothers Asuka So Much</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/13thknight.html">The 13th Knight</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Grumbling to herself, Asuka prowled the halls in search of her best 
friend, Hikari. The two of them were supposed to eat lunch together, but 
come noon, the other girl had seemingly vanished out of the classroom. 
And so Asuka headed off in hunt. None of the people she asked in class 
said that they saw her, so Asuka was reduced to poking her head into 
various rooms to check.

After disrupting several classes (and injuring poor Shinji by kicking 
him in the back of the head to get his attention; he hadn&#39;t seen Hikari 
either), she headed down a hallway that was usually unpopulated by this 
time, meant for the early classes. Asuka was halfway down the hall then 
she heard an odd noise. &#39;Hmm, is that... someone moaning? HAH! This&#39;ll 
make great gossip!&#39;

Quietly, she crept down the hallway, trying to keep from laughing 
wickedly at the situation. &#39;I can&#39;t wait to tell Hikari about this. 
She&#39;ll probably write them up, too!&#39; That thought, though, quickly faded 
from mind when she got closer. &#39;Is that... Hikari!? I... I knew she 
liked Toji, but this!&#39;

Unable to help herself, Asuka nudged the door open a little and peeked 
inside.

And immediately flattened against the wall, eyes wide and face flushed.

&#39;What!?That... that can&#39;t be right. I must be seeing things. She can&#39;t 
be... with... No way.&#39; A louder moan filtered through the door, making 
the red-head blush even harder. &#39;This is... something this weird could 
only be...&#39; Suddenly, her blushed faded and her bewildered look changed 
to one of determination. &#39;An angel!&#39;

Quickly turning around, Asuka kicked the door in, shouting, &quot;Stop right 
now, Angel! I, Asuka, Second Child, demand you release Hikari at once!&quot;

Shocked, Hikari broke away from her deepening kiss as she gasped out, 
&quot;Asuka! What are you?!&quot;

&quot;Get away from there, Hikari! It&#39;s an angel in disguise!&quot; Springing 
across the room, Asuka grabbed Hikari&#39;s arm and yanked Hikari behind 
her. She glared at the other person in the room.

As usual, Rei Ayanami didn&#39;t show much sign of embarrassment or anger; 
However, if one looked close enough, a faint ringe of red, just enough 
to lighten her pale skin to a more healthy color, could be seen. &quot;Pilot 
Sohryu. What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Seemingly unbothered by her disheveled 
appearance, she didn&#39;t even bother to correct her blouse.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong!? You&#39;re impersonating an Eva pilot and trying to seduce 
my best friend!&quot; Setting into a fighting position, Asuka told Hikari, 
&quot;Go get Shinji and tell him there&#39;s an angel in the school!&quot;

An awkward (At least to Hikari and Asuka) silence fell, as Asuka waited 
expectantly for Hikari to run out of the room, and for Rei to attack 
with some form of AT field.

Neither happened.

&quot;Um, Asuka?&quot;

&quot;What, Hikari?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s... That is Rei. We&#39;ve been, um, dating for awhile now.&quot; 
Blushing, Hikari looked down at the floor. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you because I 
thought you&#39;d overreact.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Stunned, Asuka whipped around to stare at Hikari. &quot;You&#39;ve been 
going out with that, that, that doll!?&quot;

Hikari only flushed further, so, surprisingly, Rei answered instead. 
&quot;Yes, Pilot Sohryu, Hikari and I have been dating for one month and 
three days. The day previous, Hikari approached me to apologize for your 
yelling and tripped on a rock . In the process of catching her, our lips 
connected. Hikari asked me out the next day.&quot; Delivered in Rei&#39;s typical 
deadpan tone, it was the most words Asuka had ever heard her fellow 
pilot say at once, making her even more confused.

&quot;You... and her.. and... what?&quot; Brows knit, Asuka looked between Hikari 
and Rei before settling on Hikari. &quot;Why?&quot;

Looking her best friend in the eyes for the first time since she burst 
into the room, the brown-haired girl squeaked out, &quot;She&#39;s a really good 
kisser.&quot;

&quot;Augh!&quot; Throwing her hands up in the air, Asuka stormed out of the room, 
cursing in an incomprehensible mash of German and Japanese.

The other two left in the room stood in sudden silence before Hikari 
managed to look at her girlfriend. &quot;I should probably go after her and 
explain everything, or else she&#39;s gonna explode on some poor person. 
Probably Shinji.&quot; She turned to go, but was stopped by a hand on her 
shoulder.

Turning Hikari around, Rei pressed her lips to the other girl&#39;s, 
instantly causing the other girl to relax against her slight frame. 
&quot;Good luck.&quot; Flashing a shockingly handsome smile, Rei slipped past the 
slightly entranced Hikari and left the room.

Standing there for a moment, Hikari couldn&#39;t help but to mutter, 
&quot;Really, really good.&quot;


Haha, had to write this due to an LJ thing. The challenge, by 
Shanejayell (An utterly wicked shoujo-ai author), was to write a fanfic 
with the pairing of Rei/Hikari. Since my first idea would&#39;ve taken way 
to long, I went with this.</pre>
