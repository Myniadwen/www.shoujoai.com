<h1>Thanatos</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wakabayashi.html">Joyce K. Wakabayashi</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I can&#146;t be late for my first meeting with Dr. Akagi, thought Maya Ibuki. I&#146;m 
going to look so stupid if I say I&#146;d gotten lost in NERV headquarters. She 
looked at her hand computer. &#147;Hmm, it&#146;s telling me I should go to the poolroom.&#148; 

She opened the door to the room. She stepped inside to see a vast pool and 
Ritsuko swimming in a form fitting one-piece. Ritsuko saw her and swam over to 
her. &quot;Hi,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;You must be Maya Ibuki, my new assistant.&quot; Was her 
smile a little coquettish, thought Maya. 

&quot;Yes, Dr. Akagi.&quot; She turned quickly away; embarrassed by the way her heart was 
beating. I&#39;m being silly, she thought, Dr. Akagi may be the best polymath 
specialist in the world, but you shouldn&#39;t let your excitement take control even 
if it&#39;s a major honor to work with her. She must like cool, logical people. She 
swallowed and turned around. 

&quot;I like to swim every morning. It clears my head before work. You should try 
it,&quot; Ritsuko said as she stepped out of the pool. &quot;Go to the computer room. I&#39;ll 
be there in half an hour.&quot; 

She&#39;s beautiful, thought Maya. Oh, what am I thinking? &quot;Ah, yes, Dr. Akagi!&quot; 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you call me Ritsuko?&quot; 

&quot;That&#146;s too informal!&quot; she protested. How can I just call her by her first name? 
She thought. &quot;How about Sempai?&quot; 

Ritsuko looked amused, she had a wonderful smile. &quot;Sure. I actually like it.&quot; 
She had gone off to the computer room and waited. The woman who came into that 
room seemed an altogether different woman, cool, professional, brilliant, even a 
little mysterious behind those glasses that caught the glare of the lights above 
them. She gave a short overview of the project, then explained what they were 
going to do in terms that stretched her knowledge to its limits. This person, 
Maya thought, was like a well-cut diamond, sharp and clear, but depending on 
what light she&#39;s under, showing new and interesting aspects. 

This first meeting had been several years before the Angels came. It had been in 
the early fall, but that word had lost its meaning in this world of eternal 
summer. She was introduced to the rest of the staff including Hyuuga and 
Shigeru, who were nice men that mother would probably enjoy having over, but she 
had no special feelings for them. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

It had taken weeks of having her heart speed up whenever Ritsuko was in the 
room, a wonderful giddiness and an excited nervousness for her to finally admit 
that she felt more than just simple admiration. Watching Ritsuko work and 
theorize made her feel like she was in the same room as Einstein, Steven 
Hawking, and Enrico Fermi all at the same time. But at the same time, there was 
something else. It had taken an overheard conversation between Ritsuko and Gendo 
to fully realize the depth of her feelings. 

She had forgotten a disk in Ritsuko&#39;s office and had opened the office door to 
get it, when she heard this: 

&#147;You didn&#146;t show up at the bar last night.&#148; 

&#147;I had to take Rei to bathe in LCL.&#148; 

&#147;You didn&#146;t even bother to call. I waited for you for an hour. You&#146;re such a 
pig.&#148; Ritsuko sounded like she was about to cry. 

&#147;I think you&#146;re forgetting who is Commander!&#148; 

She scuttled away from there as quickly as possible, feeling a mixture of 
embarrassment and indignation. How dare he treat Sempai like that, she thought. 
Does that man know whom he&#146;s talking to? She deserves better treatment than 
that. I wouldn&#146;t stomp all over her feelings, I&#146;d . . . Then she stopped right 
in the middle of that statement. I&#146;d . . . love her. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

The Christmas party that year had been at a karaoke bar. Hyuuga, Shigeru, 
Katsuragi, and some of the support staff showed up, but Ritsuko had declined. 
She would&#39;ve declined too, but Ritsuko had told her that she should have fun.. 

Even without Ritsuko, it had been somewhat fun. Amazingly enough, Hyuuga-kun 
tried to rap, which nearly knocked Misato off her chair with laughter, not that 
she needed that much help considering the fact that she&#39;d had drunk a big 
Sapporo bottle. Misato had gone up and sang, &quot;I did it my way,&quot; while most 
people did the obligatory pop ballads. 

When it was her turn, she shook her head out of embarrassment. Shigeru kept 
gently pushing her, saying, &quot;We made fools out of ourselves, not it&#39;s your 
turn.&quot; 

She leafed through the song selection and found the one she wanted. &quot;I want to 
sing &#39;Thanatos.&#39;&quot; 

She got up and began to sing, her voice a little shaky. 

&quot;Now it&#39;s time, I fear to tell 
I&#39;ve been holding it back so long 
But something strange deep inside of me is happening 
I feel unlike I&#39;ve ever felt 
And it&#39;s making me scared 
That I may not be what I think I am.&#148; 

Then she saw Ritsuko walk in the door and nearly gasped, but she couldn&#39;t stop 
singing. Then she decided to sing the song the best she could, with as much 
meaning as she could. 

&quot;What of us, what do I say 
Are we both from a different world 
Cause every breath that I take, I breathe it for you 
I couldn&#39;t face my life without you. 
And I&#39;m so afraid. There&#39;s nothing to comfort us 
What am I, if I can&#39;t be yours?&#148; 

She noticed Ritsuko looking up at her and smile. She felt that tightening in her 
chest. 

&#147;I don&#39;t sleep, don&#39;t feel a thing And my senses have all but gone Can&#39;t even 
cry from the pain, can&#39;t shed a tear now I realize we&#39;re not the same And it&#39;s 
making me sad Cause we can&#39;t fulfill our dreams in this life.&#148; 

She saw the members of the Christmas party looking up at her with something like 
stunned admiration. She felt a tear go down her face. 

&#147;So I must, let us break free I can never be what you need If there was a way 
through the hurt, Then I would find it I&#39;d take the blow; yes I would fight it 
But this is the one, impossible dream to live What am I, if I can&#39;t be yours?&#148; 

The song ended and she jumped off the stage and back to her seat. There was 
applause from the rest of the audience, not just the group from NERV. Shigeru 
turned to her and said, &quot;Maya, you didn&#39;t tell me you could sing.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t really,&quot; she said. 

Ritsuko walked up to her and said, &quot;It&#39;s just like you to do something amazing 
from nowhere. One of these days, you should make me a tape of that song.&quot; 

Hyuuga teased her saying, &quot;Now we&#39;ve got an idol singer in NERV.&quot; 

Maya hid her face behind her hands. 

&quot;Maya,&quot; scolded Ritsuko, &quot;Stop hiding that face, you&#39;ll never get anyone if you 
keep doing that.&quot; 

Maya put her hands down, but flushed instead. &#147;I thought you weren&#146;t coming to 
the Christmas party.&#148; 

Ritsuko took out a cigarette and lit up. One of the habits I wish she&#146;d give up, 
Maya thought. Ritsuko took a puff, then said, &#147;I decided that I should see the 
debut of Maya the idol singer.&#148; 

Maya was the only one who could see the redness in her Sempai&#146;s eyes that 
indicated she&#146;d been crying. &#147;Sempai, stay for a while. &#147; 

&#147;Yeah, Ritsuko,&#148; said Misato. &#147;Sing a song.&#148; 

Ritsuko stubbed out her cigarette. &#147;I can&#146;t sing.&#148; 

&#147;Sempai, just one song.&#148; 

&#147;OK, one.&#148; 

Ritsuko flipped through the songbook then began singing, &#147;Fly Me to the Moon.&#148; 

Maya jerked her head up and heard: 

&#147;Fly me to the moon 
and let me play among the stars 
Let me see what Spring is like 
On Jupiter and Mars 
In other words, hold my hand! 
In other words, darling kiss me&#148; 
&#147;Fill my heart with song 
and let me sing forevermore 
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore 
In other words, please be true! 
In other words, I love you!&#148; 

Tears began to stream down Maya&#146;s face. &#147;Oi,&#148; said Shigeru. &#147;Why are you 
crying?&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m crying?&#148; said Maya. She touched the moisture on her face. &#147;It&#146;s just that. 
. .&#148; Then she realized he would never understand, so she said, &#147;It&#146;s just that 
Sempai is so good at everything, even singing.&#148;
