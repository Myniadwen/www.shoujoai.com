<h1>Mornings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There are some people who wake up bright eyed and
bushy tailed. You see them at the office or in the
bus, at the gym or in the park, bouncing along happily
as they raced off to metaphorically take on the world.

Misato Katsuragi, on the other hand, was not one of
those people.

Misato awoke groggy, laying there as she tried to get
her brain going. Slipping free of the covers she left
the sleeping figure there, padding nude from the hotel
bed and walking over to peek out the window.

&quot;Where...?&quot; Misato murmured, wondering where they
were. Feeling a urgent cal from her bladder, Misato
walked on, passing the paper covered dresser and
nearly tripping over the clothes that were scattered
over the floor.

&quot;Mrrow,&quot; Misato smirked, turning to the bed and seeing
tufts of blonde hair sticking out from the covers,
presumedly belonging to her partner in last night&#39;s
escapade.

Picking up a t-shirt with her foot she slipped it on
as she stumbled into the bathroom. Finishing up Misato
flushed then headed back to bed, cuddling up to the
still sleeping figure laying there. As she relaxed her
brain began to work, processing the papers she had
seen, the landscape and everything else.

Misato&#39;s eyes popped open as she sat up with a gasp,
hurrying over to the dresser to peer at the papers
scattered on top of the dresser. &quot;Marriage licence?!&quot;
Misato blurted.

The figure on the bed sat up, her blonde hair falling
into her eyes. &quot;Misato, you&#39;re too noisy,&quot; Ritsuko
Akagi murmured, blinking.

&#39;This is the last time I suggest we go out drinking
together,&#39; Misato thought weakly.

Notes: This is almost a word for word riff on
Strangers in Paradise #70. Heh. A little present for
