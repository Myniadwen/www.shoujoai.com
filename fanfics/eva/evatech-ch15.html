<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 15 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The sudden whooping of alarms caused both women to
jerk apart, the second lingering kiss rudely
interrupted. Rei cursed softly but inventively, the
blue haired girl&#39;s red eyes narrowing angrily as she
muttered, &quot;I don&#39;t believe this.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you even knew that sort of language,&quot;
Asuka said gently, the two women sitting closely on
her living room couch. The lights were dimmed in the
suite, a soft piece of instrumental music playing in
the background.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rei blushed, &quot;do you think we need to report
in?&quot;

Asuka reached out to put a steadying hand on Rei&#39;s
arm, &quot;Actually, Commander Ritsuko herself insisted
that we get tonight off.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Rei took the lead and bent forward to gently
press her lips to Asuka&#39;s once again. They lingered a
moment, savoring the kiss, then slid apart a bit
breathlessly.

&quot;You&#39;re good at that,&quot; Asuka sighed happily, only then
realizing that she had slipped her arms around the
smaller woman.

&quot;Natural skill,&quot; Rei purred as she snuggled closer,
&quot;and a very vivid imagination.&quot;

&quot;And what else did you imagine?&quot; Asuka looked down at
her curiously, her own dark eyes twinkling with
amusement.

&quot;I think that showing you them on the couch would get
a bit uncomfortable,&quot; Rei said, her breath soft
against the base of Asuka&#39;s throat.

Asuka gently pulled them up off of the couch, standing
there holding Rei&#39;s hands. She gently tugged her
towards the bedroom, &quot;Last chance to back out.&quot;

Rei smoothly walked along beside her as she smiled up
at Asuka, &quot;Considering how long I&#39;ve wanted to do
this....&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s not wait any longer,&quot; Asuka led her into
the bedroom, then firmly closing the door behind them.


&quot;I just hope that Rei and Asuka are having a better
time than we are,&quot; Shinji sighed, the brown haired
young man sitting up against the side of the chamber
they were trapped in.

&quot;They&#39;re probably making out right now,&quot; Minmei
offered, the black haired young woman huddling close
to Shinji&#39;s side for added warmth.

&quot;Minmei,&quot; Shinji scolded, his cheeks reddening. &#39;How
could she know that.&#39; he wondered, &#39;unless she and
Asuka...?&#39;

&quot;No, we didn&#39;t,&quot; Minmei seemed to read his thoughts.

&quot;Make out?&quot; Miriya asked, the green haired young lady
sitting on Shinji&#39;s other side. It felt strange, being
this close to a male, it made her stomach hurt oddly.

&quot;You don&#39;t know...?&quot; Shinji looked at her in
confusion.

&quot;No,&quot; Miriya shook her head.

&quot;Ah, Minmei?&quot; Shinji looked over at her desperately,
hoping that she could explain the delicate subject to
Miriya.

Minmei chuckled softly. &quot;When two people go out on a
date together they do things like kiss and touch,&quot; she
explained, &quot;and we sometimes call that making out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Miriya sighed, &quot;but what is... kiss?&quot;

Deciding that a visual demonstration might be better
than a complex explanation Minmei moved to gently
press her lips to the startled Shinji, kissing the
young man lingeringly. For a few moments they were
lost to the sensations, only separating reluctantly.

&quot;What...?&quot; Shinji blinked in surprise as he saw the
other woman.

Quite involuntarily Miriya had scooted as far away
from the kissing couple as she could manage, the sight
having a unexpected effect on her. Heart racing,
soaked with sweat she almost felt like she was going
to be physically ill. &#39;Is this some mysterious
weapon?&#39; Miriya thought wildly.

&#148;Are you all right?&quot; Minmei asked worriedly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Miriya answered as she did her best to
recover her poise, trying not to show how badly she
had just been shaken.

&quot;Might be some kind of trauma associated with your
memory loss,&quot; Minmei said sympathetically, &quot;we didn&#39;t
know....&quot;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; Miriya smiled weakly even as she noticed
the shrewd glance Shinji was giving her. &#39;Does he
remember our earlier meeting?&#39; she worried, &#39;He did
see my face then.&#39;

There was a sudden rumble and they felt the walls
shift slightly. Gradually segments of the great ship
began to move, smoothly sliding back into their
customary places as the vessel shifted from
battle-mode to it&#39;s cruiser form. Finally they stood
in the street where they started out in, back when the
alarms made them run for shelter in the first place.

&quot;About time,&quot; Shinji puffed out a relieved breath.

&quot;You sure know how to show a girl a good time,&quot; Minmei
grinned at him, then she looked over at Miriya. &quot;Are
you up for more,&quot; she asked, &quot;or do you want to call
it quits for the night?&quot;

&#39;I&#39;ve already learned secrets of this battleship and
kissing tonight,&#39; Miriya thought to herself, &#39;who
knows what else I might learn?&#39; Taking a deep breath
she tried to smile like Minmei had, &quot;Yes, I would like
to continue on.&quot;

&quot;So where to next?&quot; Shinji asked them, his T-shirt
highlighting the thin young man&#39;s muscles. His coat
was still draped around Minmei&#39;s shoulders and by the
contented look on her face she had no intention of
returning it just yet.

&quot;There&#39;s always the movies or an arcade,&quot; Minmei
offered.

&quot;Movies,&quot; Shinji suggested cheerfully, &quot;I usually
can&#39;t find anyone who can give me a challenge at the
arcade, anyway.&quot;

&#39;I would give you a challenge, fool,&#39; Miriya thought
but firmly kept her mouth shut.

&quot;Maybe that martial arts film is still showing, my
cousin Kyle is in it,&quot; Minmei looked sad as she added
softly, &quot;I wish I could see him again.&quot;

Miriya looked over at Minmei sympathetically,
remembering fellow warriors and friends who had been
lost to time, distance or battle. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she
offered gently.

&quot;At least he&#39;s still alive,&quot; Shinji said, his
expression grave, &quot;there&#39;s a lot of people on this
ship who&#39;ve lost family or friends to the war.&quot;

&#39;I hadn&#39;t considered,&#39; Miriya realized. She had been
trained to see the enemy much like themselves,
manufactured warriors serving faceless masters. But
more and more she was beginning to see these
micronians as something... more.

&quot;Enough seriousness,&quot; Minmei laughed, &quot;have you heard
about the Miss Macross contest the city is holding?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re entering, of course,&quot; Shinji grinned as they
walked along together.

&quot;A contest?&quot; Miriya asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Minmei grinned, &quot;it&#39;s a beauty contest with a
talent portion, too.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;I
haven&#39;t decided what to sing yet, though.&quot;

&#39;This could be interesting,&#39; Miriya thought.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; Shinji said as they reached the
theater. He paid their way in, wincing slightly as
Minmei loaded up at the snack bar.

&quot;Yum,&quot; Minmei munched on popcorn, passing some over
for Miriya to try.

&#39;Is this some kind of combat record?&#39; Miriya wondered
as the figures leapt about on the screen, kicking and
punching away at each other with abandon. &#39;I think I&#39;m
impressed,&#39; she crunched on some more popcorn happily.</pre>
