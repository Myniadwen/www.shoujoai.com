<h1>Blood Sisters (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/bloodsis-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        &quot;I liked it.&quot; Ritsuko defended her song, meeting Misato&#39;s 
eyes. She almost felt like she was falling as she looked into her 
old friends eyes, and had to bodily pull herself away.

        &quot;So who&#39;s turn is it now?&quot; Misato asked curiously.

        Rei said deadpan, &quot;Yours.&quot;

        Misato finished off her can of beer, putting it down on the 
table. &quot;You&#39;re going to regret this,&quot; she warned the others 
cheerfully as she got up and she walked to the front. &quot;Brace 
yourselves,&quot; she picked up the mic. with a smile, a bit of red to 
her cheeks.

        &#39;Damn she&#39;s cute,&#39; Ritsuko thought.

        &quot;Go, Misato!&quot; Asuka laughed.

        &quot;Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars,
        Let&#39;s see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars,
        In other words, please by true,
        In other words, I love you,&quot;

        Misato sang out cheerfully, vamping it up a bit up on the 
stage. It might have been Ritsuko&#39;s imagination, but she almost 
thought that Misato was singing to her...

        &quot;Not too bad,&quot; Ritsuko managed, a bit of a blush to her own 
cheeks as Misato wobbled towards her seat.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Asuka asked them curiously as Shinji 
took another turn at kareoke, softly signing a sad song.

        &quot;Well, we haven&#39;t actually visited the hotsprings yet,&quot; Rei 
offered.

        &quot;Good idea,&quot; Misato grinned.

        Ritsuko hesitated before nodding slightly. Privately she 
wasn&#39;t sure if it was a good idea to be naked around Misato, 
especially with the direction her thoughts were going lately. Still, 
she couldn&#39;t stop the others just because she was having problems 
with her imagination.

        &quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Shinji smiled as they left the kareoke box 
and then headed back up the road towards the hotsprings inn. They 
moved in two groups, Shinji, Rei and Asuka in one and Misato and 
Ritsuko paired up in the other.

        &quot;Is it me,&quot; Ritsuko said to Misato softly as they walked, 
feeling a bit of a blush on her cheeks as she studied her 
intently, &quot;or are those three getting along a bit better?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, maybe,&quot; Misato looked back covertly, &quot;though it could 
be all the beer they&#39;ve drank.&quot; She smirked, &quot;Let&#39;s see how they do 
once they sober up.&quot;

        &quot;Point,&quot; Ritsuko admitted. She nearly froze as Misato 
slipped her arm in hers, and she blinked in surprise as the shorter 
woman leaned in to her. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she squeaked.

        &quot;Getting comfortable,&quot; Misato said softly. She looked up at 
Ritsuko, and the blonde felt a blush on her cheeks as Misato 
continued, &quot;I want to talk to you later.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, right,&quot; Ritsuko blinked as they reached the building.

        Shinji headed for they men&#39;s side as the rest of them walked 
into the changing room. Ritsuko quite deliberately kept her eyes 
down as they stripped off their clothes, folding up and storing them 
away in little cubicles. Still, she found herself sneaking glances 
as Misato gracefully undressed.

        Misato looked up to meet her watching eyes, and Ritsuko felt 
her cheeks go bright red. &quot;Oh,&quot; she looked down quickly in 
embarrassment at being caught peeping.

        Misato just smiled, &quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

        &quot;What&#39;s taking you?&quot; Asuka asked, a long towel wrapped 
around her as she stood at the door to the springs themselves.

        &quot;Right,&quot; Misato gave her a cheerful wave. She quickly 
finished, tossing her panties into the box as she wrapped a towel 
around her before giving Ritsuko a nod, &quot;Ready?&quot;

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Ritsuko croaked out.

        &quot;Then come on,&quot; Misato grabbed the blushing Ritsuko&#39;s hand 
and dragged her outside.

        &quot;Ah, this is nice,&quot; Rei sighed as she settled into the hot 
water gracefully, her short blue hair damp in the steam.

        &quot;It&#39;s not bad at all,&quot; Asuka softly agreed from her own spot 
beside her, both leaning up against the stone wall of the pool.

        Misato laughed as she yelled, &quot;Banzai!&quot; With a little hop 
she jumped right in, sending water splashing over the two young 
women.

        Ritsuko chuckled softly as she slipped into the water, 
watching the two girls lecturing Misato who quite cheerfully ignored 
them. Misato shook her head, the water flowing off her body, and 
Ritsuko gulped as she took in the water soaked towel clinging to 
every curve.

        &quot;You&#39;ll never grow up, will you?&quot; Ritsuko managed to get out.

        &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Misato shrugged as she settled down. She 
waved to the spot on the stone seat beside her, &quot;Why don&#39;t you take 
a seat?&quot;

        Not trusting herself to answer, she wadded over and settled 
in beside her. &quot;That does feel good,&quot; Ritsuko admitted with a smile.

        &quot;Poor Shinji,&quot; Asuka smirked, &quot;over on the far side all 
alone.&quot;

        &quot;No, he&#39;s not,&quot; Rei explained to them calmly as she pointed 
to one side, &quot;he&#39;s peeking at us over the wall over there.&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Asuka, Misato and Ritsuko yelled as they jumped up, 
seeing a familiar looking face poking up where Rei pointed.

        &quot;Shinji!&quot; Asuka roared as she charged.

        &quot;Oh, hell,&quot; Shinji&#39;s head disappeared very quickly as he 
tried to get away.

        As Asuka yelled out dire threats at the rapidly fleeing 
Shinji, Ritsuko leaned up against the wall and laughed softly. At 
Rei and Misato&#39;s curious glances she explained, &quot;Well, at least we 
know he&#39;s a normal teenager in that way.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope that Asuka doesn&#39;t get her hands on him,&quot; Misato 
said as she settled in by Ritsuko, &quot;or he&#39;ll be a normal dead 
teenager.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d better go help,&quot; Rei moved through the water, walking 
up the steps and going back into the changing rooms again.

        &quot;Help Shinji or Asuka?&quot; Ritsuko mused.

        &quot;Who knows?&quot; Misato chuckled softly.

        Ritsuko looked over at Misato, the dark haired woman longing 
there so comfortably. A thought struck her, &quot;Didn&#39;t you say you 
wanted to talk to me later?&quot;

        &quot;I guess this is private enough,&quot; Misato agreed.

        &#39;Private?&#39; Ritsuko looked over at her in surprise, &#39;Why do 
we need to be private?&#39;

        &quot;For this,&quot; Misato leaned over, gently pressing her lips to 
the startled Ritsuko&#39;s.

        After a moment of stunned shock Ritsuko leaned into the 
kiss, enjoying the feeling of her friend&#39;s gentle kiss. The tip of 
Misato&#39;s tongue slid past Ritsuko&#39;s parted lips, and with a shudder 
she let it in. A few seconds later they slid apart, breaths coming 
faster.

        &quot;Are you.. I mean, why..&quot; Ritsuko stammered.

        Misato met her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m not drunk, and this isn&#39;t an 
impulse,&quot; she said gravely. A slight smile, &quot;If you don&#39;t want this, 
just tell me and we&#39;ll both try to forget this ever happened.&quot;

        Ritsuko reached out to gently cup Misato&#39;s face, hearing the 
fear in that warm voice. &quot;I don&#39;t think I could forget a kiss like 
that,&quot; she said softly.

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Misato slid a bit closer in the warm water, 
her hands reaching out to gently stroke along Ritsuko&#39;s legs.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Ritsuko gasped softly. She looked up at the blonde and 
smiled weakly, &quot;Do you think we should maybe go somewhere more 
private?&quot;

        Misato tugged gently, pulling Ritsuko up to her feet. &quot;Lets 
go,&quot; she said quietly.
