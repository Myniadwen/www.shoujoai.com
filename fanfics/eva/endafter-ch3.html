<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
led Rei through her small apartment until they reached the bathroom. 
She ran the taps and the bath began to fill.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
assume you know how to work something like a bath, Wonder Girl?&quot; 

she asked. Rei nodded. &quot;Good, then get yourself out of that horrible 
plug suit and use it. I&#39;ll go find you some clothes. If I&#39;m letting 
you stay here, you need better things to wear than that thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
letting me stay?&quot; asked Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well 
I&#39;m not chucking you out on the street,&quot; replied Asuka. &quot;Your 
bandages, do you need a hand?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
shook her head.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;They 
are unnecessary now.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Good, 
well, see you in a bit then.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
left the bathroom, which was now rapidly filling with steam, and closed 
the door behind her. Then she went to her bedroom, opened her drawers 
and began searching through the clothes she had scraped together for 
something she thought might be suitable for Rei. She settled for a white 
shirt and a long dark skirt, with some long socks and pumps. Clothes 
had lost a lot of their importance to her since Third Impact, but now 
that she looked through them, she was a little chagrined to find there 
weren&#39;t any in her collection that she really liked the look of.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
these will have to do for now,&quot; she said aloud, picking up the 
bundle and taking them back to the bathroom. Steam was escaping from 
under the door, to be lost in the cool air of the corridor and there 
was the faint sounds of splashing water coming from within.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei?&quot; 
called Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes,&quot; 
came the reply.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Are 
you okay in there?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
am fine... I have always liked water.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;ve 
got some clothes for you,&quot; said Asuka, &quot;I&#39;ll leave them outside 
the door.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thankyou, 
pilot Soryuu,&quot; replied Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Right! 
That&#39;s something else that&#39;s got to stop,&quot; she said in exasperation. 
&quot;My name is Asuka, not &#39;Pilot Soryuu&#39;!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But 
we are both Eva pilots...&quot; said Rei, confusion in her voice.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Is 
that the only way you define yourself?&quot; asked Asuka, and when she 
was met with silence: &quot;The Evas are gone, Rei, and thank god! We 
have nothing to do with them any more. Besides, I always hated the way 
you called me Pilot Soryuu. Like I was nothing more than that to you.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
was another pause from the bathroom, during which Asuka faintly heard 
splashing water.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
didn&#39;t know,&quot; said Rei, in a voice almost too quiet for her to 
hear. Asuka suddenly felt very guilty.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hey, 
Rei? I treated you pretty badly back then, didn&#39;t I?&quot; No answer. 

&quot;I&#39;ve always felt guilty about it since. Perhaps if I&#39;d been nicer 
to you, things would have turned out differently...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;They 
wouldn&#39;t have,&quot; replied Ayanami.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They 
both lapsed into silence for a while, Asuka with her own thoughts. Eventually, 
she stirred.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
I&#39;ll leave these things for you here then. Take your time in there.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
was about to leave when a sudden thought struck her, making her pause.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei?&quot; 
she called through the closed door. There was a moment of silence, then 
her reply filtered back.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
am here, Pilot So- Asuka.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
um, its just... Don&#39;t think me rude or anything,&quot; <i>too late for 
that, surely,</i> &quot;but I wanted to ask you a... difficult question.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Go 
ahead,&quot; replied Ayanami.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well... 
which Rei are you? I know now there were lots of you. Did I ever even 
meet you personally?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
heard Ayanami inhale deeply before replying.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
think...&quot; she began, &quot;I think I&#39;m all of the Rei&#39;s... and 
none of them. I&#39;m the Rei you knew and I&#39;m a Rei that could have been.&quot; 

There was another pause, then: &quot;Does that answer your question?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not 
really...&quot; replied Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
am me,&quot; said Rei, &quot;that&#39;s all that matters.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Still...&quot; 

said Asuka, &quot;If you aren&#39;t the Rei I used to know –&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
remember... I remember you. I remember the way you hated me. I remember 
you calling me a doll. I remember you hitting me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei, 
I –&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
also remember saving you... and wanting to save you. My hand remembers 
holding longinus. It remembers the weight, the heft. My mind remembers 
how terrible it felt, even as I used it to save you. I am the Rei you 
knew.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
great wave of shame and sorrow welled up in her chest. Partly for the 
way she had treated the Eva pilot, partly for the callousness of her 
question.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; said Asuka, then wondered briefly if that was the first 
time she&#39;d ever used that word with Rei. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you now, I 
didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
did not,&quot; replied Rei. &quot;Please stay. Your presence is... comforting. 
I have rarely found comfort in another before.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fine!&quot; 
said Asuka, in a short tone of voice. But inside she felt warm at Rei&#39;s 
words. It had been a long time since she had felt needed by anyone.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
sat down with her back to the door and wrapped her hands around her 
knees.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
shall we talk about?&quot; she asked. Again she was met by silence. 

&quot;Why do you always do that? Why do you never answer questions?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
was thinking of a suitable response,&quot; replied Rei, &quot;I had 
not found one yet.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Right, 
right,&quot; said Asuka, &quot;well, how about we talk about what you&#39;re 
going to do now?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Okay,&quot; 

said Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
will you do? I mean, you can stay here, but I&#39;m not supporting you or 
anything. You&#39;ll have to find a job and get some money...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
do you do for money?&quot; asked Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
used to work in construction doing manual labour,&quot; replied Asuka. 
&quot;After Third Impact, everyone had to pull together and do whatever 
needed doing, even kids like us.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I 
finally admitted that I&#39;m a kid just then,</i> she thought to herself, <i>
and after years and years of trying to be an adult</i>. <i>Well, maybe 
I accepted that after Third Impact</i>...<i> still, I&#39;m acting 
more like an adult now than I ever did at Nerv</i>...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
do you do now?&quot; asked Rei.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
still work on building sites,&quot; she replied, &quot;though now I 
work with the heavy construction vehicles. I guess the foreman realised 
how good I was with machines.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>So 
perhaps I am still Pilot Soryuu, after all</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
was quiet on the other side of the door, then Rei spoke again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perhaps 
I could do the same.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
doubt the foreman would allow it. We&#39;re not taking just anyone any more. 
Things have got a lot better.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But 
you still work there?&quot; queried Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
a special case. They all know me and know I&#39;m capable, even if I am 
still a kid. Besides, they also know that I really need the job, so 
they just let me get on with it. But, come on Rei, there must be other 
stuff you&#39;d like to do? Jobs are hardly scarce at the moment... What 
do you enjoy doing?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
enjoy... swimming.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hmmm, 
then I suppose you could be a swimming instructor, if there&#39;s any call 
for that at the moment... Then again, with your personality, perhaps 
not. Anything else?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
was a long pause, a very long pause, but Asuka decided not to pressure 
her this time. Still, as the silence grew longer and longer, she began 
to wonder whether the blue haired girl had fallen asleep in the bath.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei?&quot; 
she finally attempted. There was the sound of splashing water, much 
louder than before, then feet were padding across her bathroom floor, 
making the boards creak slightly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She&#39;s 
getting out of the bath</i>, thought Asuka, <i>maybe she&#39;s done</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, 
the door against which she was leaning, opened behind her and Asuka 
found herself falling backwards. A completely naked and dripping Rei 
stood above Asuka, looking down at her as she sprawled, amazed, upon 
the floor.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
cannot think of anything,&quot; said the blue haired girl, and there 
was a look on her face that Asuka had never seen before; frustration. 
And worry...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
she was naked.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">NAKED.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;B-BAKA!!&quot; 
cried Asuka, sitting up quickly and turning her gaze towards the floor. 
&quot;Don&#39;t just wander around without any clothes on!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;The 
water was going cold,&quot; said Rei, as if that was a reason for doing 
so.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;F-Fine, 
fine,&quot; stammered Asuka, &quot;just put some clothes on. They&#39;re 
right there.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
pointed to the small bundle that lay beside her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thankyou 
Pil- Asuka.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
out of the corner of her eye, Asuka saw a pale, slender arm appear as 
Rei bent to pick up the clothes. The arm disappeared from view once 
more and the door closed again. Asuka found herself breathing a big 
sigh of relief.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>That 
was a shock</i>, she thought.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
hope they are warm enough for the season,&quot; she said as her heartbeat 
gradually returned to normal, &quot;I really need to get some proper 
winter clothes soon, we&#39;ll have to go shopping and get you some too.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
door opened again and Asuka stood and turned round. Rei stood before 
her in the clothes she had been given. They didn&#39;t really suit her, 
but they didn&#39;t look terrible either. Asuka also realised that the eye 
bandage had been removed, revealing her left eye. It was bloodshot and 
looked sore, heightening the red impression of her gaze all the more.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Your 
eye, is it okay?&quot; she asked, and without thinking reached out her 
hand to touch Rei&#39;s cheek. Rei did not move, but her eyes shifted to 
the hand as it reached towards her. This caused Asuka to realise what 
she was doing and she dropped it quickly back to her side.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I-I&#39;m 
sorry!&quot; she stuttered.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why?&quot; 
asked Rei. Asuka was lost for an answer. In truth, she didn&#39;t really 
know. Everything seemed to have gone a bit crazy since Rei had turned 
up and Asuka found that she didn&#39;t really understand much any more. 
About Rei, about her past, about herself.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Still, 
being confused is better than being emotionally dead</i>, a dark part 
of her mind spoke up, y<i>ou&#39;re making progress at last</i>. <i>And 
it&#39;s all because Wonder Girl turned up again</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Anyway,&quot; 
said Asuka, blushing and looking away, &quot;those clothes seem to fit 
you fine.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Will 
these clothes help me?&quot; asked Rei, plucking at the sleeve of the 
shirt.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Help 
you what?&quot; said Asuka, frowning.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Understand 
why I chose to live,&quot; replied Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
opened her mouth. Then she closed it again. Then she thought about opening 
it again, decided against it as she had nothing to say, and closed her 
eyes instead. Suddenly she felt light headed, as though she was on the 
verge of a faint.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>What 
do I say?</i> she thought, desperately, <i>I have no answers for her, 
but she came all this way</i>. <i>How do I crush her like that?</i></font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
tried not to think about how, not all that long ago, she would have 
been delighted to have been presented a chance to crush Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, 
perhaps not <i>delighted</i>...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka?&quot; 
asked Rei, &quot;Are you all right.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
fine,&quot; said Asuka, opening her eyes and smiling ruefully, &quot;I&#39;m 
just not sure I&#39;m the one who can give you the answers you want.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Oh, 
get a grip</i>, another part of her mind suddenly shouted, one she hadn&#39;t 
heard from in a while, <i>you always despised Shinji for being so pathetic, 
now you&#39;re being pathetic yourself</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
wasn&#39;t inclined to listen to that part of her mind just yet, though. 
It had been the cause of too much pain in the past...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;There 
is no one else other than you,&quot; said Rei, &quot;if you cannot, 
then no one can.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei...&quot; 
began Asuka, but again found no more words willing to follow.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... 
need you,&quot; said Rei. The distress in her voice was plain. It caused 
Asuka to wilt.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
just not sure I believe in myself that much anymore,&quot; she whispered.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
believe in you,&quot; replied Rei, reaching out her own hand to touch 
Asuka&#39;s cheek, &quot;I always did...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
couldn&#39;t stop a tear slipping from the corner of her eye. She brushed 
it away savagely.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Great!&quot; 
she muttered, &quot;I&#39;m turning into Shinji after all.&quot; She looked 
fiercely at Rei. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll try, but it&#39;ll be a slow business. 
Who knows if you&#39;ll ever get an answer? Right now though, it&#39;s getting 
late and I&#39;m feeling more than a little emotionally shattered. You must 
be too. I suggest we both turn in.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
nodded.</font> <br> <br></p>
