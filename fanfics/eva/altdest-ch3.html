<h1>Altered Destinies (part 3 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Shinji Ikari lay back on the bed, the black haired
young lady&#39;s eyes closed as she tried to collect her
racing thoughts. Just this morning she had been
recovering in a sterile hospital bed and now this
evening she was in a new bedroom living with two other
women.

A smiling Ritsuko had helped Misato and her carry all
of Shinji&#39;s stuff inside, then they had introduced her
to the penguin, Pen Pen. Why two women had a penguin
for a pet she didn&#39;t know, but there it was, resting
in the second fridge. Dinner had been quiet, then as
quickly as possible Shinji had retreated to her new
room.

&#39;What am I doing here?&#39; Shinji wondered, covering up
her eyes with her arm. &#39;I&#39;m just a ordinary kid, why
am I being asked to do something like this?&#39;

A flash of memory, the battle against the Angel... she
remembered it all, no matter what she had told the
doctors at NERV. She touched her arm, recalling the
phantom pain of it being broken, then the searing
agony as the Evangelion&#39;s head was pounded on. She had
been barely able to get EVA-01 moving at first, and
was utterly unable to fight.

She still didn&#39;t know what turned the tide in the
battle, not really at any rate. The last head blow,
maybe, or the anger at the situation she was in,
something changed inside Shinji. Grasping the controls
she had fought back, breaking free of the Angel&#39;s
grip, then began to fight back. Somehow her will
combined with the Evangelion to repair it&#39;s arm, then
she had struck back with an unimagined fury.
Ruthlessly she drove it backwards and when it tried to
protect itself with some kind of force field... she
tore through it like paper.

&#39;How did I do that?&#39; Shinji questioned. Why did she
have such a feeling of... belonging, when she was
inside the Evangelion? It had almost felt like those
long forgotten memories of childhood, cradled in the
safety of her mother&#39;s arms.

And then there was Rei... when her father had wheeled
in the badly injured girl to pilot Evangelion, Shinji
had been horrified. Wrapped in bandages, being hauled
around on a medical bed, the blue haired Rei had met
Shinji&#39;s gaze with her uninjured eye and something
just clicked. Shinji refused to see her hurt any more,
especially by her father.

&quot;I&#39;ll pilot Evangelion&quot; Shinji murmured to herself
softly&quot;if only to protect her.&quot;

In the kitchen of the apartment two women were
cleaning up as they talked together quietly. Ritsuko
finished washing a dish, the blonde passing it to her
partner as she noted&quot;Shinji barely said anything
during dinner.&quot;

A smiling Misato took it carefully&quot;It&#39;s not like we
could sit around talking about work at the dinner
table.&quot; She rinsed off the dish and put it in the rack
as she said&quot;And I doubt she&#39;d want to talk about it,
anyway.&quot;

&quot;True&quot; Ritsuko agreed. She smiled impishly as she
teased&quot;Not to mention Shinji was still getting over
her surprise at us being a couple.&quot;

Misato rolled her eyes&quot;I said I was sorry for not
telling him, love.&quot; A bit more seriously she asked&quot;So
how&#39;s Ayanami&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be a few weeks before she&#39;s fully recovered&quot;
Ritsuko answered frankly&quot;we&#39;ll need to rely on Shinji
alone until then.&quot;

Misato sighed&quot;Then we&#39;d better get her into the
simulator and start training, we can&#39;t rely on luck or
whatever gift she has again.&quot;

Finishing up the dishes Ritsuko remarked&quot;Do you get
the feeling she isn&#39;t telling us everything that
happened while fighting the Angel&quot;

Misato took Ritsuko&#39;s hand as they went through the
apartment&quot;Yes, but can you blame her? I do think she
isn&#39;t holding back information out of malice.&quot;

Ritsuko pushed open their bedroom door&quot;Considering she
seems to loathe the commander, we&#39;re lucky she&#39;s even
piloting Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s an understatement&quot; Misato agreed as she
followed her in&quot;we shared a elevator with the
Commander, not a word from either of them.&quot;

&quot;Marvelous&quot; Ritsuko sighed. They began to undress as
she asked&quot;Is there anything in her personnel file to
explain it&quot;

Misato sat on the side of the bed to slip her shoes
off. &quot;Just that he left Shinji with her Aunt and
Uncle&quot; she answered as she smoothly undressed, dumping
clothes on the floor&quot;oddly they haven&#39;t tried to
contact him despite his being in hospital.&quot;

&quot;Looks like we&#39;re all Shinji has&quot; Ritsuko sighed as
they settled down on the bed together.

Misato snuggled to her side&quot;She could be doing much
worse.&quot;

The next morning Shinji woke up first, venturing into
the kitchen to make some toast. The young woman
blinked as she noticed the penguin looking up at her
expectantly. &quot;Yes&quot; she finally had to ask Pen Pen.

&quot;He just wants his morning fish&quot; Ritsuko yawned as she
wandered into the room dressed in an oversized
nightshirt. She opened the fridge and got out a can of
sardines, spilling them out into Pen Pen&#39;s bowl.

&quot;Good morning Dr. Akagi&quot; Shinji said nervously.

&quot;Coffee, coffee&quot; Ritsuko fumbled about in the shelves
till she found her favorite mug, filling it from the
pre-brewed pot. &quot;You can just call me Ritsuko here&quot;
she took a drink&quot;we are all living in the same house.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try&quot; Shinji said softly.

&#39;For someone who was so tough in Gendo&#39;s presence,&#39;
Ritsuko found herself noting, &#39;she sure can be shy.&#39;
Taking another drink she said&quot;Do you mind going into
NERV with us today, we&#39;re going to have to fit you
with a plugsuit.&quot;

&quot;Plugsuit&quot; Shinji looked up at the blonde scientist
curiously.

&quot;The entry plug can pick up your thoughts and
intentions&quot; Ritsuko explained&quot;but the plugsuit helps
make it work more efficiently.&quot;

Before Shinji could answer Misato stumbled into the
kitchen dressed in a very short T-shirt and panties.
Opening the fridge she pulled out a can of beer,
popped it open and proceeded to slam it back in one
go. &quot;Ahh, that was good&quot; she sighed happily.

&quot;Beer first thing in the morning&quot; Ritsuko frowned&quot;And
in front of Shinji&quot;

&quot;Hey&quot; Misato said defensively&quot;it&#39;s a tradition! I&#39;m
just substituting beer for sake, is all.&quot; Changing the
subject she asked&quot;What were you talking about&quot;

&quot;Plugsuits&quot; Ritsuko said succinctly.

Misato popped open another can of beer. &quot;You&#39;ll need
to pick out a color&quot; she took a more conservative
drink&quot;but not red or white.&quot;

&quot;I saw Rei in the white&quot; Shinji looked thoughtful&quot;is
there another pilot as well&quot;

&quot;Asuka Soryu Langley&quot; Ritsuko crisply offered&quot;who&#39;s
currently involved with the testing of the Unit-02 in
Germany.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll take blue&quot; Shinji dubiously
examined some older bread then stuck it in the
toaster&quot;it&#39;s simpler.&quot;

&quot;Good enough&quot; Ritsuko nodded. She opened up the fridge
then looked inside before closing it with a
sigh&quot;Remind me to go grocery shopping tonight. Who
wants takeout for lunch&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan&quot; Misato agreed. She casually
snagged a piece of Shinji&#39;s toast&quot;We&#39;ll need to get
you registered for school, too.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t the exciting life of a pilot keep me from
going to school&quot; Shinji asked hopefully.

&quot;Sorry&quot; Misato shook her head&quot;Rei and Asuka go to
school, you&#39;ll have to go as well.&quot;

Ritsuko looked amused, &#39;Nice to see she&#39;s got the
normal dislike of school.&#39; Aloud she asked&quot;Do you have
any favorite foods, Shinji&quot;

&quot;Huh&quot; she looked startled.

&quot;We are going shopping for you, too&quot; Misato smiled,
&quot;Shin-chan.&quot;</pre>
