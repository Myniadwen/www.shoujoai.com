<h1>Third Genesis (part 27 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Yui Ikari walked back to the apartment with Rei and
Asuka, conversation halting and hesitant. Her body was
that of a teenaged boy, her mind was that of a grown
woman and the combination wasn&#39;t all that easy to deal
with, honestly.

&quot;So how did the examination go?&quot; Asuka asked her
curiously, thinking of her own interactions with Dr.
Ami Mizuno.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; a faint smile on the boy&#39;s face. Yui tilted
her head back, &quot;I was given a physical, psychological
examination and a pop quiz on synthetic organic
technologies.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Rei noted softly.

Asuka watched the two talk and blinked. The
resemblance between them was subtle but there, and
there was a odd echo of mannerisms too. It wasn&#39;t just
that they shared genetic data, it was as if they were
both different incarnations of the same person,
separated by different experiences.

&quot;I did like Dr. Mizuno,&quot; Rei offered, &quot;when I met
her.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Yui admitted, &quot;she clearly knows what she&#39;s
doing.&quot; A wry smile, &quot;I almost wish I had met her
years ago, we could have used her help on Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;Hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; Asuka admitted as they
reached the apartment that they all now shared with
Misato.

Rei smiled slightly as they went inside, remembering
the look on Yui&#39;s face when she saw the mess in the
suite. Admittedly with school Asuka and Rei hadn&#39;t
been cleaning up after Misato as much as usual, but
Yui&#39;s shock at the mess had been a bit much. &#39;Or we&#39;re
getting used to Misato,&#39; she conceded silently.

&quot;Who wants to order the take-out?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Yui offered quietly, &quot;I could make
something.&quot;

Asuka looked at Yui in surprise, reminding herself
that this boy was not whom he seemed to be. &quot;Well,&quot;
she said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s in the fridge...&quot;

All three opened up the fridge and peered inside.
There was a tray of snacks, soda, cans of beer and
condiments, mostly. &quot;Slim pickings,&quot; after picking up
a furry something Yui had to admit, &quot;guess I&#39;ll have
to try cooking something up next time.&quot;

&quot;You can do the take-out order if you like,&quot; Rei
offered the phone.

Yui looked amused as she took the phone and chuckled,
&quot;You know, I think this is the only house in Megatokyo
with the major restaurants on speed dial.&quot;

&quot;Well, I think Ritsuko and Maya do too,&quot; Asuka
defended Misato automatically.

Not long after a car pulled up outside the apartment
building and Maya and Ritsuko got out, walking towards
the building together. &quot;Well,&quot; Ritsuko said to Maya
cheerfully, &quot;I think your parents took it well.&quot;

Maya looked up at the taller blonde wryly, &quot;Well, I
suppose so.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;At least mom&#39;s happy
I&#39;m marrying a doctor.&quot;

&quot;And I think your dad will talk to me eventually.&quot;

Maya sighed, &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t really hinted to the two
of them about me, you know.&quot;

They walked up to their apartment, Ritsuko unlocking
the door. &quot;I really haven&#39;t asked you about this
stuff,&quot; she admitted as she took her coat off,
revealing a conservative black dress.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Maya blinked, taking her own coat off. She
looked boyishly cute in dark pants and a white shirt,
discrete earrings glinting.

&quot;Coming out and all that,&quot; Ritsuko smiled at her
gently. She settled on the couch, patting the cushion
beside her as she continued, &quot;I know you&#39;re out at
NERV, for instance.&quot;

Maya settled beside her, sighing tiredly. &quot;Considering
how many people noticed me mooning after you,&quot; she
remarked, &quot;it was bound to happen.&quot;

&quot;If it helps the gossip didn&#39;t reach me for awhile,&quot;
Ritsuko said.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Maya smiled slightly. She tilted her head in
thought, &quot;Well, most of my old college friends know, I
was pretty active back then.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ritsuko raised an eyebrow.

Maya blushed as she murmured, &quot;The college gay society
was pretty much a singles club, and I dated quite a
bit.&quot;

&quot;I suppose I should thank those girls for teaching you
so well,&quot; Ritsuko purred, enjoying seeing Maya blush.
She looked at Maya thoughtfully, &quot;And your Tokyo
friends?&quot;

&quot;A few know,&quot; Maya nodded, &quot;but I was a bit more
selective there.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;Sempai, do you tell
anyone...?&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;re my lover and that we&#39;re engaged?&quot; Ritsuko
smiled warmly. &quot;Whenever anyone asks about the ring,&quot;
she said simply.

Maya took Ritsuko&#39;s hand, smiling up at her happily.
&quot;Me too,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I&#39;m so proud that we&#39;re
together.&quot;

Ritsuko stroked a hand through Maya&#39;s hair, &quot;So do you
want to eat in tonight?&quot;

Maya shifted to gently press her lips to Ritsuko&#39;s,
smiling hungrily. &quot;What I want to eat,&quot; she said,
voice husky, &quot;isn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s menu.&quot;

&quot;Bad girl,&quot; Ritsuko laughed as she rose swiftly
picking up the surprised Maya.

&quot;Eep!&#39; Maya squealed as Ritsuko bodily carried her to
the bedroom. Laughing she asked, &quot;I wonder if Misato&#39;s
date is going this well?&quot;

Ritsuko set Maya down on the bed and began to undress.
&quot;We&#39;ll ask her tomorrow,&quot; she promised. Smiling as she
slid her dress to the floor she commanded, &quot;Tell
talking, more kissing.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya agreed, kissing her happily.

ZWING!

In another part of the city Misato ducked with a
curse, the bullet whizzing by above her head. She
hefted the paintball gun and glared at her companion,
&quot;Do you always take girls out to paintball after a
romantic dinner?&quot;

Aoba Kinushima just grinned back, her own goggles
shielding her eyes. &quot;You have to admit, it&#39;s
different,&quot; the black haired woman pointed out.

Misato shook her head, the camouflage costume that she
wore still spotlessly clean. &quot;I&#39;ll give you that,&quot; she
popped up, aiming fast and pinging several of the
young men who were facing them. Ducking down again she
added, &quot;So what&#39;s the objective?&quot;

Aoba studied her thoughtfully, &quot;Capture the flag,
basically.&quot;

Misato popped her clip, counting the pellets then slid
it away. &quot;I&#39;ve always hated to loose,&quot; she narrowed
her eyes dangerously.

&quot;Then follow me,&quot; Aoba agreed. With that the other
woman bolted from her concealment, her speed enough to
startle the nearest foes, splattering them with pain.

Misato was right behind her, taking out foes from a
distance, her hours of target practice at NERV coming
in good steed. Working together they advanced from
pieces of cover to gradually sweep their way through
the paintball forest, eventually reaching the flag and
dropping the younger man waiting there.

&quot;You know,&quot; Misato said later, a slight smile on her
face as they went back to the changing rooms, &quot;that
was kind of fun, actually.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Aoba chuckled softly, putting the pistol she
had used away. She remembered fondly, &quot;I used to play
with a group of construction crazies when I was
younger.. I didn&#39;t think I liked it at first but I
learned to enjoy it.&quot;

&quot;How did you get into this in the first place?&quot; Misato
asked as they reached their lockers, stripping the
safety gear off and changing to regular clothes.

&quot;My big sister&#39;s boyfriend got me involved,&quot; Aoba
admitted. She looked at Misato thoughtfully as they
left, &quot;Well, what do you want to do now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had a good time tonight,&quot; Misato admitted, &quot;but
I think I&#39;d better get back home to the kids.&quot; She
gave Aoba a impish grin, &quot;I&#39;d like to go out with you
again, though.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Aoba nodded agreement.
