<h1>Past, as it will be tomorrow (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Dr. Naoko Akagi paused in the hallway outside the office of the new 
commander of GEHIRN and took a nervous breath. Then the black haired 
woman knocked firmly, waiting until she heard a muffled voice call, 
&quot;Come in.&quot;

Sitting behind her desk Yui Ikari was studying the paperwork on the 
latest test series with a frown, her dark brown hair falling into tired 
looking eyes. Since the disappearance of her husband during the Unit-01 
contact experiment she had been working night and day to find out what 
had happened to him.

&#39;But does she already know, and is just not telling us?&#39; Naoko wondered 
grimly. Even more worrying, did Yui know about her affair with Gendo 
before he disappeared? If she did, it could get... messy.

Yui looked up at last, her mona lisa smile as enigmatic as ever. &quot;How 
goes our attempts to reactivate Unit-01?&quot; she asked calmly as she set 
the papers aside.

&quot;It&#39;s ready, and the pilot candidates for it and Unit-00 are ready,&quot; 
Naoko nodded. She hesitated a moment, &quot;But... why THOSE girls?&quot;

&quot;According to the Marduk Institute, the candidates have the best 
psychological profiles for piloting,&quot; Yui frowned, &quot;though to be honest, 
I have my own doubts. But for now, they&#39;re the ones available, so...&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Naoko said after a moment.

Yui paused a moment then asked, &quot;Do you have any suggestions who should 
supervise the pilot testing?&quot;

Naoko looked thoughtfull a moment, &quot;How about Professor Fuyutsuki? Other 
than you and... well, he know the Evangelion technology best.&quot;

&quot;Other than my husband, yes,&quot; Yui agreed with a sigh.

&quot;Mama?&quot; a soft voice asked, coming from the door leading into the room 
beside the office. The young boy looked nervous standing there, his 
short brown hair falling into eyes that resembled both Gendo&#39;s and 
Yui&#39;s.

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you and Shinji alone,&quot; Naoko said with a wry smile, well 
aware at how traumatized the boy was. Whatever had happened to Gendo had 
occurred with Shinji and Yui there in the lab, the boy visiting with his 
parents. &#39;Poor kid,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Yui smiled. As Naoko was leaving she heard her murmur, 
&quot;2004 hasn&#39;t been a very good year, let&#39;s hope things improve soon.&quot;
Sometime later as a alarm rang through the complex Ritsuko Akagi growled 
under her breath as the black haired girl ran along the hallway. &quot;Mother 
if I find out you nominated me for this, I&#39;ll...&quot; she grumbled as the 
twenty year old girl tried to finish pulling the tight sky blue plugsuit 
top on.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Misato Katsuragi blinked as a partially dressed girl 
ran by. &quot;Ritsuko?&quot; she hurried after her, the nineteen year old&#39;s longer 
black hair flowing.

&quot;Oh thank you,&quot; Ritsuko muttered as Misato caught up with her. &quot;Can you 
give me some cover, please?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Misato asked as she kept pace, using her body 
to preserve the other woman&#39;s privacy a bit.

&quot;They&#39;re running tests on Unit-01,&quot; Ritsuko explained as she finally got 
herself into the top, &quot;and they need a pilot. Also, I&#39;m late.&quot;

They jogged together to one of the elevators, both a bit out of breath. 
&quot;You&#39;re crazy, right?&quot; Misato shook her head, &quot;A guy disappeared into 
that thing.&quot;

They stepped into the elevator and Ritsuko hit the switch to take them 
down into the Geofront itself. &quot;That was a freak accident,&quot; Ritsuko said 
briskly, &quot;it&#39;s not going to happen again.&quot; Despite her brave words 
Ritsuko patted her pants looking for a cigarette, apparently forgetting 
she was dressed in the plugsuit.

Misato found her eyes drawn by the gesture to her friend&#39;s legs, then 
her eyes swept up her sleekly dressed body. Ritsuko was in good shape, 
and had developed enough to fill out the skin tight costume in all the 
right places.

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Ritsuko blushed, seeing where she was gazing.

&quot;In that outfit,&quot; Misato replied with a chuckle, &quot;you really can&#39;t blame 
me for looking.&quot;

Ritsuko blushed but had a hard time denying that point. &quot;One of these 
days I&#39;m going to talk Miss Ikari into putting you into one of these,&quot; 
she growled, crossing her arms over her chest. &#39;Though if the Marduk 
report I saw on mother&#39;s is right, you will be anyway,&#39; she silently 
mused.

&quot;She&#39;s my guardian, remember?&quot; Misato smirked as the elevator dropped 
smoothly beneath the Earth then added wickedly, &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think 
she goes that way.&quot;

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Ritsuko made a face as she answered with a groan, &quot;I really did 
not need that mental image, Misato!&quot;

Yet oddly, Ritsuko found herself feeling more relaxed as the elevator 
finally came to a stop. Misato was good at that, taking her mind off the 
oddness of their lives now and helping her enjoy their days away from 
here. &#39;Even if I do have to help her in school in return,&#39; Ritsuko mused 
with a wry smile.

&quot;Mind if I tag along?&quot; Misato asked as they headed down the brightly lit 
hallway together. The facility housing GEHIRN&#39;s main base was almost 
shiny new, and they could hear their footsteps on the new floors as they 
hurried along.

&quot;Am I going to be able to stop you?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Probably not,&quot; Misato agreed cheekily.

Together they hurried into the observation booth, looking out through 
the glass at the massive being that waited eerily for life. The 
Evangelion was a sleeping giant in the large testing chamber, a series 
of massive restraints and scaffolding surrounding the purple and pink 
colored humanoid.

&quot;Ritsuko,&quot; Naoko turned as the head technician said, &quot;you&#39;re late.&quot;

&#39;Bitch,&#39; Misato thought uncharitably.

Yui Ikari reached out to put a calming hand on Naoko&#39;s arm as she said 
gently, &quot;She&#39;s a student and helping us here, Naoko.&quot;

Naoko relaxed a little, her expression softening a bit, &quot;Sorry.&quot; A faint 
smile teased her lips, &quot;And are you joining us too, Miss Katsuragi?&quot;

Misato calmly met her eyes, &quot;I thought I&#39;d watch, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Of course you can,&quot; Yui smiled at her gently. Looking over at Ritsuko 
she said, &quot;We&#39;re just running entry plug tests today, we won&#39;t be 
plugging you into Unit-01 yet.&quot;

Under her breath Naoko muttered, &quot;I still think we&#39;re wasting valuable 
time.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll discuss it later,&quot; Yui murmured back. More loudly she said, 
&quot;Misato, would you and Ritsuko go down to the entry plug?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Ritsuko took Misato&#39;s hand as they walked to the door in the 
side of the control room, leading down to the waiting entry plug.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Misato asked as they walked down the stairs.

&quot;Yui wants to talk to mom dear alone,&quot; Ritsuko sighed, &quot;wish I knew what 
about.&quot;

Yui waited till the door closed before walking over to the glass and 
saying, &quot;Naoko, there&#39;s no need to rush.&quot;

&quot;Only if you accept the one interpritation of the Dead Sea Scrolls,&quot; 
Naoko crossed her arms in front of her, &quot;that says the Angels will come 
in 2015. The other reading implies they&#39;re coming in 2005.&quot;

&quot;And you want your daughter to fight them?&quot; Yui asked almost 
disbelievingly.

&quot;She&#39;s twenty years old,&quot; Naoko said flatly, &quot;not a child to be 
protected, Yui. I think she can do it.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t even know if someone that age can operate a Evangelion,&quot; Yui 
shook her head, &quot;the best projected age is a teenager. What if it hurts 
her?&quot;

&quot;Then so be it,&quot; Naoko said flatly.

Ritsuko closed her eyes, she and Misato having gone back up the stairs 
outside the door to listen in on their conversation. &quot;Ritsuko...&quot; Misato 
reached out to squeeze her arm gently in silent comfort. Shaking the 
hand off and livid with rage Ritsuko keyed the door open and stormed 
inside, racing towards her mother.

&quot;Wha...&quot; Naoko started.

&quot;You bitch,&quot; Ritsuko slapped Naoko&#39;s face with all her might, sending 
her mother crashing to the floor. Tears in her eyes the young woman ran 
out of the room, Misato hurrying after her.

&quot;Oh hell...&quot; Yui sighed, torn between chasing after the girls and 
helping Naoko. With a resigned sigh she helped the other woman up as she 
said, &quot;Well, I think we have a new problem to deal with.&quot;</pre>
