<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ballad of Fallen Angels (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessierae.html">Jessie-Rae</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kira Matthews, sixth candidate selected in accordance with the Marduke 
institute to pilot the semi organic combat unit known as Evangelion. She 
is the designated pilot of production model Eva unit 00. Personal data 
remains intact. 

Unlike the previous children, she has grown up with a stable family life 
and has no social problems as far as we know of, she is less likely to 
suffer metal instability. 

Asuka sighed and put down the report that had been written up about the 
sixth child.

&quot;She sounds like a miracle Maya, I bet you wish the rest of us could 
have been like that, don&#146;t you?&quot; she asked her friend Maya frowned.

&quot;You don&#146;t really think that do you, you kids did everything that you 
could and we&#146;re all proud of you for that,&quot; she said lightly scolding 
her assistant and partner of two years, Asuka smirked and leaned back in 
her chair.

&quot;Do you really think that another pilot is needed, I mean, do you really 
think there will be more Angels?&quot; she asked looking up at Maya who was 
drinking from a mug of coffee, Maya shrugged.

&quot;We&#146;ll see soon enough.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Kira Matthews sighed and looked out the planes small window. Still 
nothing below them but water she thought dully and closed the shutter, 
she wasn&#146;t in the best mood at the moment, having only been selected as 
an Eva pilot a good six months ago, she wasn&#146;t really prepared to do 
this, no matter how much training she had received. 

She looked down at her lap and the objects that were clasped in her 
hands, one was a photo of herself with an attractive brunette cradled in 
her arms protectively and the other was an envelope with her name 
written on it in cursive handwriting. Ah what the hell she though and 
carefully opened the envelope.

Kira, 

     By the time you read this you&#146;ll obviously be pretty far away from 
me, which sucks cuz I think I miss you already.

Don&#146;t feel discouraged about leaving; you should feel very honoured to 
be selected as a pilot, hell I am. And I&#146;m sure you won&#146;t have any 
trouble in the friends department, you&#146;re just plain talented that way. 

I know I must have said this millions of times already, but I love you

Kira could not read any longer, tears were spilling so fast that she 
couldn&#146;t see. She closed her eyes and drifted into restless sleep.

Maya Ibuki was standing patiently outside gate number 30, awaiting the 
arrival of the sixth child. She had been looking forward to meeting the 
girl, she was the first pilot (with the exception of Suzahara) to have a 
somewhat healthy family life and like the previous children she was an 
accomplished musician excelling in both piano and the guitar. She also 
was a lot older than her predecessors, at a healthy age of nineteen.

With the advance of time, Eva technology had advanced as well, Nerv had 
successfully been able to reconfigure the programming in the Eva&#146;s to 
synch with more mature brainwaves. Maya had been the figure behind that 
little upgrade; she strongly disapproved of the use of pilots at such a 
young age and had complained to the directors of Nerv, who agreed with 
her on the condition that she did it with her own funding, which she 
managed; that clever little move got her promoted to major. 

The gate door was opened and a tall blonde girl stood before her, she 
was lean and well toned and stood with a confidant stance. Her shoulder 
length blonde hair fell in untidy bangs that covered her sparkling green 
eyes. She was a sight to behold. The only luggage she carried with her 
was a small duffel bag, which she clutched rather tightly. 

&quot;Welcome to Tokyo 3 Miss Matthews,&quot; Maya said greeting the young blonde 
with a pleasant smile which was returned with dashing ease.

&quot;Thanks . . .&quot; Kira began, but trailed off Maya laughed uneasily and 
shook her head.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, my name is Major Maya Ibuki,&quot; she said Kira grinned and held 
out her hand Maya took it and they shook hands.

&quot;Nice to meet you Maya,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&#146;t want to stay here to long if 
that&#146;s alright with you . . . I have this thing about airports, they&#146;re 
so dull. Would you mind if we just grabbed my bags and left?&quot; Kira asked 
hesitantly, Maya shook her head and smiled.

&quot;Not a problem.&quot; 

Both women stood waiting for Kira&#146;s luggage to come around. Kira&#146;s 
expression brightened and she waltzed over to the luggage train and 
grabbed a black case covered in stickers. 

&quot;Eh, is that all the luggage?&quot; Maya asked uncertainly Kira shook her 
head jovially.

&quot;No, no, I still have one more bag,&quot; she said, &quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Well it&#146;s just that you only had one bag and a guitar case, that&#146;s not 
very much,&quot; Maya said shyly Kira smiled at her reassuringly Maya 
blushed, that smile stirred something inside her that she hadn&#146;t felt in 
awhile.

&quot;I may not have many possessions, but the ones I do have I treasure 
dearly . . .  I&#146;m not at all a material person Maya Ibuki,&quot; she said, 
satisfied that she had gotten her message across. A black suitcase came 
around the corner and Kira moved over to it and picked it off with 
relative ease. 

&quot;Now I&#146;ve got it all,&quot; she said placing the suitcase down gently. &quot;I 
hope I&#146;m not bothering you with all this, I know you must be busy 
Major,&quot; Kira said softly her expression was soft and caring.

&quot;Not at all, it was my suggestion to come and pick you up, I&#146;ve sort of 
been anxious about meeting you,&quot; Maya said a blush spreading across her 
face.

&quot;Why is that?&quot; Kira asked raising her eyebrows. 

&quot;We&#146;ll talk about it in the car,&quot; Maya said, &quot;C&#146;mon, let&#146;s go,&quot; and they 
both began to walk out of the Tokyo-3 international airport. 

****

Maya&#146;s car was nice, but it was something Kira herself would not have 
picked. It was a black, a 1966 mustang convertible and a very hard car 
for most people to come across. Kira couldn&#146;t help but wonder where she 
got it. 

&quot;So, what was it like living in Australia?&quot; Maya asked conversationally 
Kira smiled sadly.

&quot;It was a nice country, my father was often at work so I had to find 
things to muse myself with. We lived in Melbourne where the fourth 
branch is, it was a lovely city, with flowers everywhere and clean 
streets, I even had a job,&quot; Kira said fondly Maya smiled. 

&quot;It sounds nice,&quot; she said softly, Kira turned her head to face Maya. 

&quot;So why were you anxious for me to start piloting in Japan?&quot; she asked, 
Maya&#146;s brow furrowed slightly.

&quot;Before you started, the children we had piloting were only fourteen, 
that&#146;s a very young age to be dealing with something as traumatic as 
piloting an Eva . . . and you sounded like an interesting person,&quot; she 
said softly Kira smiled.

&quot;I see . . . Maya?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Yes Kira,&quot; 

&quot;What were the other children like?&quot;

&quot;Well, the first child Rei Ayanami, she was very reserved she said about 
two whole words to me the entire time I knew her, she didn&#146;t think much 
of her own existence either, she disappeared last year. Then there was 
the second child Asuka Sohryu, she was stubborn and cocky, but in the 
end she was the most unstable of the children, but she&#146;s fine now, she 
works in my department . . . And Shinji, he was a sweet boy once you got 
him to open up, but her was haunted his whole life by the his father, he 
plays cello in the Japanese symphony orchestra now. The there was Touji 
Suzahara, I never met him. And Kaworu Nagisa, he was the 17th Angel; I 
never spoke to him either,&quot; Maya finished with a sad look on her face, 
&quot;What about you Kira, what are you like?&quot; she asked Kira blushed.

&quot;Oh, I don&#146;t know, you tell me,&quot; she said bashfully. 

&quot;Well, I&#146;d say you were calm and quietly confident . . . so far you&#146;ve 
been honest and I have to admit you&#146;re beautiful,&quot; Maya said shyly Kira 
smiled brilliantly.

&quot;I think you were pretty close . . . you don&#146;t do to bad for yourself 
either,&quot; she said smirking.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Maya said sincerely a small blush gracing her cheeks. 

&quot;You&#146;re welcome,&quot; Kira said, &quot;Umm, I don&#146;t meant to sound rude, but do 
you know were I&#146;ll be living,&quot; she asked curiously Maya blushed. 

&quot;W-well, it has been decided, that you&#146;ll be living with me for now. You 
can change your mind if you like but . . .&quot; she stuttered Kira sighed in 
relief. 

&quot;That&#146;s good, even though I&#146;m old enough, to live by myself at the 
moment would be . . . difficult,&quot;

&quot;I won&#146;t ask,&quot; Maya said understandingly.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;They arrived at Nerv headquarters about half an hour later. The car 
trip was comfortable, even for Kira, who wasn&#146;t a shy person to those 
she knew, but she had a habit of retreating into herself around people 
she&#146;d never met. But she felt open and comfortable with Maya, who was 
friendly and cheerful most of the time. 

&quot;I&#146;ll show you where you can keep your things later, but now I think it 
would be best if you met everyone,&quot; 

They walked down numerous halls; Maya seemed to know her way around the 
facility very well. They entered an elevator which took them straight up 
into the command centre where several technicians and other people 
loosely related to that job were talking and typing at there work 
stations. Maya lead the blonde over to a desk where a Young red head 
sat, the first thing Kira noticed about her was the scar; it ran from 
just above her eyebrow and down to her jaw line. When she heard Maya 
approaching she looked up and smiled.

&quot;Hey Maya,&quot; she said standing, &quot;Looks like you brought a friend,&quot; she 
said and held out her hand to Kira who took it and they shook hands.

&quot;The names Asuka and I can only guess who you are,&quot; she said. Apart from 
her scar, Asuka was a beautiful young girl only a year younger than 
Kira. She had a youthful energy about her that Kira found herself drawn 
to.

&quot;Kira . . . Matthews, the sixth child,&quot; Kira said lamely, the title of 
the sixth was not something Kira was initially proud of. 

&quot;Well, well Maya, the sixth child&#146;s a cutie,&quot; Asuka said winking, Maya 
rolled her eyes at her partner&#146;s playful antics. Kira felt her cheeks 
flame up at the statement but she held her head high. &quot;You have a synch 
test in a few days,&quot; Asuka said, serious again. &quot;We thought you could 
use a break before you started work, it was only fair really, till then 
just try and relax and get to know everyone. Oh and one more thing, it 
helps to know your way around here, sometimes this place can be so damn 
confusing,&quot; Asuka said, and started to walk off. As she walked past Maya 
there fingers lightly brushed and they smiled at each other fondly, Kira 
couldn&#146;t help but smile at the obvious display of affections. 

&quot;I&#146;ll see you later ok,&quot; Asuka said softly and left the control room to 
pursue some unknown task. Maya sighed softly and murmured something 
under her breath then blushed when she saw that Kira was watching. 

&quot;Do you want a quick tour of the place?&quot; Maya asked, hoping that the 
question would change the subject that was open for observation, Kira 
obviously didn&#146;t miss a thing she thought to herself a little 
disappointed. Kira smiled understanding that the Major didn&#146;t want to 
talk about it.

&quot;That&#146;s not necessary, I&#146;ll figure it out alright on my own I think, I&#146;d 
just like to get my stuff home and have a small rest if that&#146;s ok,&quot; 

&quot;That&#146;s fine,&quot; Maya said and they walked out side again. 

Once in the car Maya spoke.

&quot;Asuka lives with me too, I&#146;m sorry I just told you but I didn&#146;t know 
how you&#146;d react,&quot; she said Kira smiled reassuringly.

&quot;No, I haven&#146;t got a problem with that. I was in a relationship too 
before I left,&quot; she admitted sadly.

&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; Maya asked kindly, hoping that the 
blonde women wouldn&#146;t shy away from her.

&quot;I . . . it&#146;s not that bad really. But she is the most beautiful girl in 
the whole world and I know I&#146;m going to miss her terribly,&quot; Kira began 
and reached into her pocked, she fished out her wallet and pulled out a 
picture of the same brunette, except this time she was on her own 
smiling softly for the holder of the photograph. Kira handed it to Maya, 
who glanced at it briefly before returning her sites to the road before 
her. 

&quot;She is beautiful, what&#146;s her name?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;Laura, I met her at Allan&#146;s, that&#146;s where I work, it&#146;s a music shop,&quot; 
Kira said weakly.

&quot;We&#146;re here,&quot; Maya said as they pulled into the driveway of her small 
home. Stepped out of the car and took a little look around. It was a 
small Japanese style house that sat at the end of a white pebble 
driveway; it was a charming house to say the least. 

&quot;It&#146;s so pretty,&quot; Kira said admiring the lovely exterior.

&quot;Well we like it, though Asuka still frequently complains about the 
furniture,&quot; Maya added with a hint of amusement at her lover&#146;s expense.

&quot;Just take your stuff inside, I&#146;ll show you where your room is,&quot; My said 
cheerfully as she picked up Kira&#146;s heavier suitcase, Kira took her 
duffle bag and guitar, Maya unlocked the front door and they dropped her 
things inside. Kira followed Maya down a small hall at the end of the 
hall was a door. Maya opened it and lead Kira inside.

&quot;This will be you room, it&#146;s no bigger or smaller than the main bedroom 
so you were lucky there. The bathroom&#146;s to your right and I think you 
can figure everything else out, I have to go back to work for a while, 
but we&#146;ll be home by seven, make yourself at home till then and welcome 
to your new home I guess,&quot; Maya said happily, Kira looked uncertain for 
a moment, like she was trying to decide what to do next. She threw her 
arms around the brunette and smiled.

&quot;Thank you, Maya.&quot;
