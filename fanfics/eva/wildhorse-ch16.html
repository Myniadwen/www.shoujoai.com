<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 16 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/wildhorse-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&quot;It will be interesting to see how Ranma deals with Asuka&#39;s breakdown,&quot; 
Nabiki commented.

&quot;And this is the episode where Rei s-self-destructs,&quot; Akane said, her 
voice cracking. &quot;She died in the original story, but they activated 
another copy and told everyone she lived. That&#39;s not an option now. If 
she sacrifices herself this time, she really will be gone.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;You mean Ranma might lose one of the girls he 
loves? That&#39;s so sad. I don&#39;t know if I want to watch this episode.&quot;

&quot;He could lose both of them,&quot; Nabiki said somberly. &quot;Asuka went off the 
deep end and retreated from the world after Rei sacrificed herself for 
Shinji. She just disconnected and became catatonic. I hate to see how 
she reacts if Ranma manages to save Rei this time when he didn&#39;t save 
her.&quot;

&quot;But he couldn&#39;t save her,&quot; Ukyo argued. &quot;That bastard Gendo wouldn&#39;t 
let him.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Nabiki explained. &quot;To Asuka it will be just another 
statement that she&#39;s worthless, not important enough to send Ranma out 
to help.&quot;

&quot;Aiya! Is too too sad,&quot; Shampoo said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;How did the sync testing go?&quot; Misato asked Ritsuko as the blonde sat 
down with her coffee.

&quot;Not good, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;All of their scores are down, but 
Asuka&#39;s plunged to the point where I&#39;m not sure she can even get her Eva 
to move. I&#39;ve had to request another pilot. We can&#39;t depend on her 
anymore. She&#39;s allowing herself to be consumed by depression. It&#39;s as if 
the last angel destroyed the barriers in her mind that held all her 
demons at bay.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really sad,&quot; Misato said. &quot;Ranma is trying so hard to reach out to 
her, but the harder he tries the further she just retreats.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Asuka?&quot; Ranma said, stepping out on to the balcony where the girl was 
sitting with her knees pulled up to her chest and her arms wrapped 
around them.

Asuka didn&#39;t respond, just stared out across the skyline. Ranma reached 
out to her, but she flinched away from his touch. A wave of hurt passed 
through Ranma&#39;s eyes but it was quickly suppressed. Ranma took a seat 
beside the girl.

&quot;Asuka, I can&#39;t even begin to understand what that angel did to you,&quot; 
Ranma said softly. &quot;All I know is that you&#39;re hurting real bad right now 
and I want to help. You can push me away all you want but it won&#39;t work. 
I love you and I&#39;m not giving up on you no matter what. Rei and I...we 
need you Asuka-chan.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie,&quot; Asuka said bitterly. &quot;Why would you need someone as 
worthless as I am? I probably can&#39;t even activate Unit 02 anymore.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not worthless, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;Stop thinking you 
are. You&#39;re very important to me and also to Rei.&quot;

&quot;What good am I to either of you if I can&#39;t pilot an Eva?&quot; Asuka asked 
in disgust.

&quot;I know how you&#39;re feeling,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;Back where I came from, 
there was this one time that the perverted old letch that calls himself 
the Grandmaster of our Ryu got pissed at me. He used a Moxibustion point 
on me that removed my strength. I was so weak that my strongest punch 
could barely be felt. I was at the mercy of my rivals and anyone else 
that chose to attack me. I felt as worthless and depressed as you do now 
and I asked one of my fianc&eacute;es that same question you just asked; what 
good was I if I couldn&#39;t be a martial artist? She couldn&#39;t answer, and 
that hurt even worse.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so what happened?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;I guess she felt guilty about not being able to answer,&quot; Ranma sighed, 
&quot;because it was one of the few times that she stepped up and helped me. 
She didn&#39;t let me give up. She told me that we would find a way to get 
my strength back and she reminded me of who I was. I learned a new 
technique that didn&#39;t require strength to perform. To this day it&#39;s one 
of my stronger techniques and I used it to beat the old letch and get 
the scroll that showed us how to counter the Moxibustion point.&quot;

&quot;Well, there is no scroll that will help me,&quot; Asuka said harshly.

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;but I learned the answer to the question you 
asked. What good are you if you can&#39;t pilot an Eva? Asuka, you&#39;re a 
brilliant girl. You&#39;re not even 16 yet but you hold a college degree. 
Even if you never piloted an Eva again, you could do just about anything 
you wanted. And so what if you can&#39;t pilot? That&#39;s not why I love you. 
That&#39;s not why Rei loves you. We love you because of who you are, not 
what you do. You&#39;re just as beautiful, smart, and desirable now as you 
were when I met you; maybe even more so since you let go of the superior 
attitude you had then.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say,&quot; Asuka argued. &quot;How would you take it if 
you could never practice the art again?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d probably be more depressed than you are right now,&quot; Ranma admitted. 
&quot;But you know what? You and Rei wouldn&#39;t let me give up on life and Rei 
and I don&#39;t plan to let you give up either. Asuka-chan, you can get it 
back. Whatever that angel did to your head has knocked you off your 
center. I promise, all you have to do is find your center and you&#39;ll be 
back better than ever. This is just a bump in the road, Koi. It might 
take you some time to get past it, but as long as you never give up, you 
will win.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Asuka repeated somberly.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;It is easy for me to say...because I 
believe in you, Koi. I know you can do it. You just need a little time 
to sort things through. Use the meditation techniques I taught you. 
They&#39;ll help you find your center again.&quot;

Ranma reached out and stroked Asuka&#39;s hair. He was pleased that this 
time she didn&#39;t flinch away.

&quot;And remember, Rei and I love you,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;We need you. Not 
because of what you do, but who you are.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Where have you been?&quot; Ritsuko demanded as Misato burst into the command 
center.

&quot;Sorry, I was detained,&quot; Misato said in an irritated tone. &quot;Report!&quot;

&quot;We have an angel floating in the sky above Tokyo 3,&quot; Hyuga said. &quot;Field 
pattern is alternating between blue and orange.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Misato asked Ritsuko.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ritsuko said, looking at the video image of the glowing, 
double helix-shaped torus hanging in the sky above them. &quot;But I don&#39;t 
think this is its only shape.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Misato said. &quot;I want Rei out there on point. Have Asuka ready to 
back her up.&quot;

&quot;Misato, Asuka will be lucky if she can get her Eva to move, as low as 
her sync rate is,&quot; Ritsuko said.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do about it,&quot; Misato spat. &quot;I don&#39;t have the 
authority to unfreeze Unit 01.&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Gendo said from above them. &quot;Have Unit 01 removed from 
cryo-stasis and deploy it on point. Rei will back up the Third Child. 
Hold Unit 02 in reserve.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat in Unit 01 looking up into the sky at the angel. He gripped 
his progressive katana and waited for it to do something. Unit 00 stood 
some distance away armed with a naginata.

&quot;Damn, what&#39;s it waiting on, Rei?&quot; Ranma complained.

&quot;I do not know,&quot; came Rei&#39;s dispassionate reply. &quot;I do not think we have 
to wait much longer.&quot;

As she said this, the angel began to glow and suddenly the torus was 
broken. The angel, now looking like a long, glowing snake, darted in 
toward Ranma with terrible speed. However, Ranma&#39;s lightning fast 
reflexes and agility bonus, courtesy of the Nekoken, allowed him to 
easily spin out of the way and land a counterstrike with the katana as 
the angel barreled past.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ranma cursed, as he saw the katana pass right through the 
angel&#39;s body as if it were insubstantial.

Unit 01 leaped into the air as the angel tried to hit him in the back. 
When he came down he drove the katana into the ground and began to form 
a Mouko Takabisha. Firing the ki/AT blast, he quickly discovered that he 
wasn&#39;t the only one too agile to hit as the angel easily avoided the 
blast while making another attack run on Ranma. It continued like this 
for several more passes until Ranma deployed his Nekoken claws.

As the angel streaked by, Ranma swiped at it, catching it three-quarters 
of the way down its length. The claws cleanly severed the rear quarter 
of the angel&#39;s body, causing its glow to flicker momentarily. 
Unfortunately, a moment later the segments rejoined each other like it 
had never happened.

Still, the attack had evidently hurt the angel because it paused as if 
rethinking its strategy. Suddenly it attacked again, only this time it 
didn&#39;t attack Ranma. It went after Rei.

Rei was unprepared for the sudden switch in targets and would have been 
unable to avoid the swiftly moving angel anyway. She was an excellent 
pilot, but she just didn&#39;t have the preternatural reflexes and agility 
Ranma possessed, nor did she have the mastery over her Eva that Ranma 
did. All she could do was put up her AT field.

The angel streaked in and slammed into the AT field. Much to everyone&#39;s 
dismay, it passed right through and struck Unit 00 squarely in the lower 
torso. Instead of causing damage though, vein-like ridges looking much 
like filliform corrosion began to spread from the impact site as the 
angel began to infect Unit 00 and its pilot.

Rei writhed in her seat as the ridges began to appear on her as well. 
Suddenly she was somewhere else. She was standing on the bank of a pool. 
In the pool stood someone, or something that looked like her twin.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;I am you,&quot; her mirror image replied.

&quot;You are not me,&quot; Rei disagreed. &quot;Are you one of the beings we call 
angels?&quot;

&quot;Join with me,&quot; her mirror image entreated.

&quot;I will not,&quot; Rei declined.

&quot;I want to give you something,&quot; the mirror image said. &quot;Can you feel 
that? Can you feel the pain?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I have felt this all my life,&quot; Rei said dispassionately.

&quot;It is called loneliness,&quot; the mirror image said.

&quot;I know what it is called,&quot; Rei said. &quot;I don&#39;t have to feel it anymore.&quot;

&quot;You are referring to your relationship with the one called Ranma,&quot; the 
mirror image laughed. &quot;What will happen when he is returned to where he 
came from? You will feel the pain once more.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Rei denied. &quot;If Ranma must return to his reality then I will still 
have Asuka.&quot;

&quot;The one that even now turns away from you?&quot; the mirror image asked. 
&quot;Without Ranma to hold you together do you really believe that the one 
called Asuka will stay with one like you? Join with me.&quot;

&quot;I will not,&quot; Rei negated.

&quot;You will,&quot; the mirror image laughed. &quot;You must.&quot;

Then Rei was back in the entry plug of Unit 00. The ridges now covered 
her body and began to creep onto her face. Rei began to despair. She 
could only think of one solution to destroy the angel and save Ranma and 
Asuka. Tears began to flow from her crimson eyes as she grabbed on to 
the angel to prevent its escape when she activated the self-destruct 
system.

&quot;Goodbye, Ranma,&quot; Rei said softly. &quot;Goodbye, Asuka. I love you both.&quot;

&quot;Rei! Listen to me,&quot; Ranma shouted in alarm. &quot;Don&#39;t you even think about 
triggering that self-destruct! Remember what I taught you! You have the 
angel right where you want it! It&#39;s trying to merge with you. That means 
its defenses are down. Use the technique we came up with! Don&#39;t you dare 
give up!&quot;

&quot;I-I cannot,&quot; Rei said. &quot;The angel is too strong.&quot;

&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Ranma argued. &quot;Concentrate, Rei! Feel the power inside you! 
Reverse what the angel is trying to do!&quot;

Rei closed her eyes and concentrated. She felt her ki, a warmth pooling 
just below her belly. She began to gather it and concentrate her power. 
Suddenly, it was no longer a gentle warmth. It was as if a switch had 
flipped or a match was thrown into a puddle of gasoline. Now her power 
was like a raging inferno inside her, building and intensifying as it 
spread throughout her body. What she didn&#39;t realize was that her efforts 
to gather and concentrate her power had awakened the dormant S2 organ 
within her and it began to amplify her ki many times over.

Regardless of where the power was coming from, Rei seized on to it and 
began to force the corruption from her body. The vein-like ridges 
covering her began to glow then fade. Once her body was purged, Rei 
forced her power out into Unit 00. The ridges that had formed on the Eva 
likewise began to glow and fade.

The angel realized that it was failing in its attack and tried to get 
away. It was too late though. Rei continued to force her power out into 
the angel itself before it could cut off the link it had been using in 
an effort to assimilate the Eva. The vein-like ridges now began to form 
on the angel as it writhed and thrashed to get free. It began to glow 
brighter and brighter until it shone like the sun. When the glow faded, 
it was gone.

&quot;Way to go, Rei!&quot; Ranma cheered. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I am well,&quot; Rei said, smiling at her success, happy that she could 
remain with Ranma.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;What just happened?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Unit 00 just absorbed the angel,&quot; Ritsuko said in shock. &quot;What is the 
status of Unit 00?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no trace of the corruption, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya said. &quot;It&#39;s like Rei 
turned the tables on the angel. Instead of it corrupting her, she 
corrupted it and absorbed it into Unit 00&#39;s body.&quot; She continued to 
study the telemetry and suddenly gasped. &quot;That&#39;s not all, Ma&#39;am! The 
sensors are reporting that Unit 00 now has an S2 organ as well!&quot;

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Ritsuko gasped, completely floored by this development. 
&quot;How is that possible?&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Up on the command balcony, Gendo was scowling behind his steepled hands. 
His plans were falling apart before him. He hadn&#39;t missed Rei&#39;s 
expression of love to the Second and Third Child. That was unacceptable. 
Unfortunately, now there was little he could do about it. Replacing her 
was no longer an option. How could this situation have developed right 
under his nose without him knowing about it?

He looked down into the command center and suddenly he had his answer. 
He glowered at the two women down there. Akagi and Katsuragi were 
responsible for this. There was no way he couldn&#39;t have known about it 
unless they were covering for the teens. The bitches were probably 
encouraging it the whole time. And Fuyutsuki; he was probably in on it 
too. He had been the one to destroy the clones, which left Gendo with no 
options in replacing Rei with another uncorrupted version.

He was surrounded with traitors. They had been working against him the 
whole time. Ever since the Third Child had arrived things hadn&#39;t been in 
his control. The boy had somehow corrupted them all and turned them 
against him. And now there wasn&#39;t a damn thing he could do about it. 
SEELE was now suspicious of him. He didn&#39;t have enough time to develop 
new tools to institute his plan. He would have to play the hand he was 
dealt and pray that events would give him his precious Yui back.

Gendo realized that as much as he wanted to have the boy killed for 
threatening his plans, doing so would only serve to bring everything 
down around his ears. He still needed the boy and he could be used to 
assure Rei&#39;s cooperation. Others, however, had no such protection. Gendo 
scowled down at the two women that had hid this from him. They would pay 
for their disloyalty.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Things are not going according to the scenario,&quot; a monolith stated in a 
German accent.

&quot;Yes, now another Evangelion has acquired an S2 organ,&quot; another monolith 
said angrily.

&quot;Not only that, but the pilot somehow assimilated the angel,&quot; the German 
voice said.

&quot;Gendo Ikari is out of control,&quot; a third monolith spoke up.

&quot;We were unable to turn Fuyutsuki,&quot; said a monolith labeled SEELE 01 in 
the voice of chairman Keil. &quot;We must find another cat&#39;s paw to use 
against Ikari.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey Doc,&quot; Ranma greeted as he entered Doctor Akagi&#39;s office.

&quot;Oh, hello, Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko said in a subdued tone as she stared at her 
monitor.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;You sound sad.&quot;

&quot;I just got off the phone with my Grandmother,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;She told 
me that my cat died.&quot;

&quot;Aw, geez, that sucks,&quot; Ranma said sympathetically. &quot;Is that your mom?&quot;

Ritsuko looked away from her monitor to see Ranma standing behind her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ritsuko answered. &quot;And that&#39;s your father behind her.&quot;

&quot;And you off to the side there,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;You were cute with dark 
hair.&quot;

Ritsuko gave a sharp bitter laugh.

&quot;Dr. Akagi, we have to talk,&quot; Ranma said seriously.

&quot;What do you want to discuss, Ranma?&quot; the blonde asked.

&quot;Not here,&quot; Ranma said his eyes darting to the security camera.

&quot;I&#39;m very busy, Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko pointed out.

&quot;I&#39;m aware of that, Dr. Akagi,&quot; Ranma said formally. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t ask if 
it wasn&#39;t important.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Ritsuko said. She assumed it had something to do with his 
relationship with Rei. &quot;Alright, I can spare a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;Come with me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;We&#39;ll take a little walk.&quot;

Several minutes later, Ranma and Ritsuko were walking along the nature 
path in the geofront. Ranma stopped when they reached the garden that 
Kaji had planted.

&quot;Wait here a minute,&quot; Ranma instructed.

Before she could reply, he vanished from sight. Several minutes later, 
he reappeared next to her startling her.

&quot;Sorry, Doc,&quot; Ranma said apologetically. &quot;I had to take care of some 
watchers. Now we can talk.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s so important that you dragged me out here?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;You remember when I told you to watch your back around Gendo?&quot; Ranma 
asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ritsuko said.

&quot;Well, now you need to be really careful, Ritsuko,&quot; Ranma said grimly. 
&quot;Now that the cat&#39;s out of the bag with Rei and I, things are gonna get 
ugly. Gendo is about to throw you to the wolves when SEELE comes after 
him. SEELE is going to try to turn you by telling you some nasty things 
about the relationship between Gendo and your mother.&quot;

&quot;Oh? And how do you know this?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;I know a lot more than I let on. I know what Gendo is planning,&quot; Ranma 
said. &quot;I also know that he used your mother, much like he used you.&quot;

Ritsuko stiffened. How could Ranma know of her relationship with Gendo?

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ritsuko,&quot; Ranma said sadly. &quot;I know you&#39;ve started to see 
Gendo for the bastard he is and you aren&#39;t especially loyal to him. I&#39;m 
also sorry about what happened to your mother. I intend to make the 
bastard pay for what he&#39;s done, for all the people he&#39;s hurt. Both he 
and SEELE are wrong and I plan to take them both down.&quot;

&quot;Why are you telling me this? How can you know all this?&quot; Ritsuko 
demanded.

&quot;I&#39;m telling you this because I need your help,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;When the 
shit hits the fan, we&#39;ll need all the help we can get.&quot;

&quot;We?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Rei, Asuka, Misato, and I,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m hoping that we&#39;ll have the 
support of the JSDF when the time comes as well. I need your help too. 
I&#39;m taking a big chance here, but I consider you a friend and I think I 
can trust you to help us make the bastard pay for what he did to your 
mother. Am I wrong? Can I trust you?&quot;

&quot;What if I say no?&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;I won&#39;t be leaving here will I?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a cold-blooded killer, Ritsuko,&quot; Ranma said sadly. &quot;I won&#39;t 
hurt you, but if it turns out that I can&#39;t trust you, and I will know no 
matter what you say, I&#39;ll have to turn you over to JSDF Intelligence. I 
understand they are currently hosting Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki as well.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s what happened to him,&quot; Ritsuko smiled ruefully.

&quot;Yeah, it was SEELE that originally abducted him, but Kaji got him out,&quot; 
Ranma explained.

&quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Gendo is going to send you to SEELE when they demand to see Rei,&quot; Ranma 
explained. &quot;They are gonna tell you terrible things in order to make you 
angry and turn on him. They have no idea that you ain&#39;t been especially 
loyal to Gendo for some time. I want you to go along with them. Let them 
think they&#39;ve turned you. But I need you to control your anger. We&#39;re 
gonna get the bastard, but we have to do it right if we wanna stop SEELE 
as well. When you get back, we&#39;ll talk more about what we&#39;re gonna do.&quot;

&quot;Alright, I&#39;m in,&quot; Ritsuko agreed. &quot;I still want to know how you know 
all this.&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Ranma smirked, &quot;is a secret.&quot;

Ritsuko found herself pulling her face out of the dirt after a nasty 
face-fault. Ranma sweat-dropped and scratched the base of his pigtail in 
chagrin.

&quot;Are you okay, Doc?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice, Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko said, spitting out a mouthful of 
dirt.

&quot;Um...sorry,&quot; Ranma said nervously.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Rei, how long has this been going on between you and the Third Child,&quot; 
Gendo interrogated the blue-haired girl standing before his desk.

&quot;Ranma and myself have been dating since before the arrival of the 
Second Child,&quot; Rei said dispassionately.

&quot;I see,&quot; Gendo said, fuming inside. &quot;And why did you not tell me this?&quot;

&quot;It was felt that you would disapprove of our relationship,&quot; Rei 
informed him succinctly.

&quot;So if you knew I would disapprove, then why did you proceed?&quot; Gendo 
asked.

&quot;Because Ranma made me...happy,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;I see,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;And if I ordered you not to see him anymore?&quot;

&quot;I would disregard such orders,&quot; Rei said flatly.

&quot;I could prevent it, you know,&quot; Gendo pointed out.

&quot;I do not believe that is true,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Ranma would not allow it and 
you could not stop him short of killing one or both of us which you will 
not do.&quot;

&quot;Are you so certain?&quot; Gendo asked.

&quot;I am,&quot; Rei said. &quot;We are both necessary to your plans. Without us, you 
cannot achieve your goals.&quot;

Gendo glared at the girl. She, of all people, knew the truth of her 
words. He was impotent to threaten her though she was blatantly defying 
him to do so.

&quot;If that is all, Ranma is waiting for me,&quot; Rei said, turning and walking 
out without bothering to wait for his leave.

Gendo sat silently at his desk for several minutes trying to master his 
anger. In the end, it was a futile effort and he surged to his feet and 
heaved his desk over in rage, scattering the few items that had been 
resting on it.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka was slowly improving. She was still depressed, but she was no 
longer retreating from those she loved. She was very subdued around 
others though.

Currently she was with Ranma and Rei out on a double date with Toji and 
Hikari. Toji had just gotten his casts off and they had all gone out to 
celebrate. They had had no trouble getting into the classy steakhouse 
even without reservations, since Tokyo 3 had become virtually deserted 
of late as more and more people fled the constant attacks.

&quot;I really want to thank you, Asuka,&quot; Toji spoke up. &quot;You saved my life. 
I know we haven&#39;t always been on good terms, but I want you to know, if 
you ever need anything, all you have to do is ask.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, Asuka,&quot; Hikari smiled. &quot;You&#39;re a really great friend and 
if it wasn&#39;t for you, I wouldn&#39;t have my Toji.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka said, flashing a weak smile before going back to staring 
at her plate.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Hikari asked, concerned for her friend.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Asuka replied. &quot;I&#39;m just tired.&quot;

Ranma put his arm around her and gave her an affectionate squeeze.

&quot;She&#39;s been having a hard time lately, but she&#39;s getting better,&quot; Ranma 
said.

&quot;Really? Anything we can help with?&quot; Hikari asked.

&quot;No, I&#39;ll be fine, really. I just have to sort some stuff out, get my 
head on straight, you know,&quot; Asuka said.

&quot;Well, if you need someone to talk to, I&#39;m here,&quot; Hikari offered.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka said, her smile having a bit more warmth in it this 
time.

&quot;So you guys wanna go play miniature golf after this?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Um...Ranma, the miniature golf course was destroyed months ago,&quot; Hikari 
sweat-dropped.

&quot;Oh...um...sorry,&quot; Ranma said sheepishly. &quot;How about we visit the ice 
cream shop?&quot;

&quot;Closed down,&quot; Toji said. &quot;Between the attacks and the money they were 
hemorrhaging due to a certain ice cream scamming trio, the owner decided 
to open up somewhere safer than Tokyo 3.&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; Ranma said in horror. &quot;No more ice cream?&quot;

&quot;Well, you can still buy it at the market, but the shop is gone,&quot; Toji 
said.

&quot;That sucks,&quot; Ranma remarked bitterly. &quot;Isn&#39;t there anything left to do 
around here?&quot;

&quot;Not much,&quot; Hikari said. &quot;I&#39;m sure things will return once the attacks 
stop.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;I think the bowling alley is still running,&quot; Toji suggested.

Ranma looked at him dryly.

&quot;Do you seriously wanna see what I do to a bowling alley?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Let me guess, you bowl a 300 every time,&quot; Toji deadpanned.

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;I tried it once. Wasn&#39;t much of a 
challenge. I had a tougher time not damaging the equipment than I did 
knocking the pins down.&quot;

&quot;Why does this not surprise me?&quot; Asuka asked, smiling for a change.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not my fault they don&#39;t build the stuff to withstand a 16lb 
ball moving at 100 miles an hour,&quot; Ranma said defensively.

Hikari and Toji both sweat-dropped while Rei just sat there like it was 
nothing out of the ordinary.

&quot;I&#39;d hate to see what you&#39;d do with a baseball,&quot; Toji commented.

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t let me play after I threw the ball to the first basemen 
and it broke his hand inside the glove,&quot; Ranma said sheepishly. &quot;I also 
broke a lot of bats until I figured out to infuse them with my ki.&quot;

&quot;Basketball?&quot; Toji asked.

&quot;They let me play that, but it wasn&#39;t much of a challenge,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;Nobody could keep up with my speed and I could slam-dunk from mid 
court. They also let me play soccer too. That was a little more 
challenging.&quot;

&quot;How about rugby?&quot; Toji asked.

&quot;I played that for a while, but it got really boring,&quot; Ranma sighed. 
&quot;They put me in at the beginning until we got a good lead in points and 
then I&#39;d get benched for the rest of the game so the other players could 
have a chance to do something.&quot;

Asuka rolled her eyes at this while Toji slapped his hand to his 
forehead and groaned. Hikari just blinked at him in dismay.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So did you have fun, Asuka-chan?&quot; Ranma asked as they walked home, Rei 
clinging to one arm and Asuka on the other.

&quot;Yeah, you were right,&quot; Asuka said grudgingly. &quot;It was nice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Ranma smiled at her. &quot;How about I give you both a nice, 
relaxing backrub when we get home?&quot;

&quot;That would please me,&quot; Rei agreed.

&quot;You won&#39;t hear me turning that offer down,&quot; Asuka chimed in. &quot;So how 
did the Commander react to the news that our Rei is no longer his little 
play toy?&quot;

&quot;He was displeased,&quot; Rei reported. &quot;However, he will not come between us 
at the present time. I informed him that any attempt to do so would 
result in...unpleasant consequences.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, way to go, Rei-chan,&quot; Asuka said, impressed to hear about Rei 
standing up to someone like that.

&quot;I&#39;m proud of you, Rei-chan,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;But you both know that we 
gotta be extra careful now. We gotta watch out for each other or the 
bastard&#39;ll try to use one of us to control the others. I love you guys 
and I don&#39;t want anything to happen to you.&quot;

The mood was slightly subdued after that. The trio continued home in 
silence, wordlessly enjoying each others company.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So, Ranma talked to you?&quot; Misato asked Ritsuko.

The blonde had just returned from her ordeal at the hands of SEELE. In 
spite of being prepared for it, Ritsuko was still seething and wracked 
with grief over what they had said to her. They had ruthlessly spelled 
out just how badly Gendo had used not only her, but her mother before 
her.

&quot;Yes, he talked to me,&quot; Ritsuko spat bitterly, taking a large swallow of 
her drink. &quot;And he was right, about everything.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it seems that way,&quot; Misato said, sipping her beer. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
where he got his information, but everything he&#39;s told us is true. So 
you&#39;ve decided to join the team?&quot;

&quot;I want to take that bastard down,&quot; Ritsuko snarled. &quot;For what he did to 
my mother, I want to pull the trigger myself.&quot;

&quot;I understand how you feel,&quot; Misato said. &quot;I want them all to go down. 
My father would still be alive if it weren&#39;t for them. You&#39;ll probably 
have to get in line for a shot at Gendo though. I don&#39;t think there will 
be much left of him after Ranma gets through with him.&quot;

&quot;As long as the filthy, manipulating bastard gets what&#39;s coming to him,&quot; 
Ritsuko growled, taking another long pull of booze.

&quot;What you sow, so shall you reap,&quot; Misato said, holding up her beer.

Ritsuko clinked her glass against the beer bottle and the pair drank a 
toast to Gendo and SEELE&#39;s downfall.

(oO\O/Oo)

Nabiki stopped the tape and shook her head in amazement. She couldn&#39;t 
believe this was the same Ranma that vanished from here barely a week 
ago. Not only did he seem to be masterminding a complex plan against 
expert manipulators, his handling of the situation with Asuka showed 
more sensitivity than she would have thought him capable of in her 
wildest dreams.

&quot;Why the hell did he let us treat him like we did if he&#39;s that capable?&quot; 
Nabiki wondered out loud.

&quot;That&#39;s not so hard to figure out,&quot; Cologne grinned. &quot;The simple fact 
is, he was so starved for acceptance, he was willing to forgive huge 
transgressions against him to get it. He never had a chance to have any 
normal friends before and since he came here, the attacks on him or 
those around him have isolated him from anyone but us. Normal people 
simply don&#39;t want to get pulled into the intense martial arts battles we 
experience regularly.&quot;

&quot;If he had treated me as nice as he does Asuka, I wouldn&#39;t have hit him 
so much,&quot; Akane complained.

&quot;Why would he, Akane?&quot; Nabiki drawled. &quot;You never gave him a chance.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Akane demanded.

&quot;You&#39;re the one that offered him friendship, but as soon as you found 
out about the curse, you attacked him, calling him a pervert and a 
freak,&quot; Nabiki explained. &quot;It&#39;s a wonder he came to care about you as 
much as he did. You can&#39;t expect him to be as compassionate toward you 
as he is to Asuka when you constantly go around insulting him and 
questioning his honor.&quot;

&quot;But...but...&quot; Akane tried to argue but then just sighed. &quot;At least he 
appreciated when I helped him with the weakness Moxibustion.&quot;

&quot;I hope you all appreciate the fact that if he returns, he probably 
won&#39;t put up with the shenanigans he ignored before,&quot; Cologne said, 
looking at each person in the room meaningfully, especially the fathers.

&quot;The boy will do as I tell him,&quot; Genma insisted.

&quot;Don&#39;t bet on it, Sugar,&quot; Ukyo snapped. &quot;You&#39;ll probably be the first 
person he goes after.&quot;

&quot;And if he doesn&#39;t, then I will,&quot; Nodoka spoke up with iron in her 
voice. &quot;If my son returns, Husband, you will no longer leave him to fix 
the problems you created. In fact, I intend to repudiate any and all 
engagements made on Ranma&#39;s behalf.&quot;

&quot;Ranma will marry Akane!&quot; Genma bellowed. &quot;It&#39;s a matter of honor!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t try that foolishness with me, Husband,&quot; Nodoka hissed. &quot;What of 
Miss Kuonji&#39;s honor? What of the honor of all the other families you 
engaged Ranma to? You have broken our family honor many times over when 
it suited you. You no longer have a right to claim any.&quot;

&quot;But Nodoka...&quot; Genma started.

&quot;But nothing, Husband,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;Until you fix the mess you made, 
Ranma will not be obligated to marry anyone. I suggest you start 
thinking about how you&#39;re going to fix things.&quot;

Nabiki smirked as she watched Genma begin to sweat under the weight of 
Nodoka&#39;s glare.

&quot;Oh my, I&#39;m so glad that sweet Rei girl managed to survive,&quot; Kasumi 
said, causing everyone to blink as she expertly broke the tension with 
the apparent non sequitur. &quot;Poor Ranma would have been so heartbroken if 
she had died.&quot;</pre>
