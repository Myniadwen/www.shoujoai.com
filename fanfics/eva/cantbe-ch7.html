<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Ritsuko sighed as she slumped down into her chair. That had been a 
complication she hadn&#39;t anticipated. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; Why had she 
so willingly let go just then? And more to the point, what was she so 
upset about anyway? She was in control of her situation wasn&#39;t she? 
Everything that had happened between herself and the commander, it 
wasn&#39;t anything she had any desire to get out of, really. Was it? So why 
did she feel so bad about it this time, almost as if someone had been 
watching her, like her conscience, a reminder that what she was doing 
was morally abhorrent and her heart wasn&#39;t in it at all, that she had 
been wishing somebody else had been there with her, that it had been 
someone else&#39;s body against hers. She could feel the saltwater trailing 
down her face again. Never before had a feeling for someone else 
permeated her consciousness like this, almost to the point of obsession. 
Ritsuko knew that she only felt like this because what she wanted was so 
unattainable, she knew that if anything were to happen between them her 
feelings of confusion and desperation would almost certainly diminish, 
but for now that failed to register as she wept.

&quot;I love her.&quot;

Maya finally arrived back at Ritsuko&#39;s shortly after ten p.m. She placed 
her suitcase inside the door and glanced around. &quot;Sempai?&quot; She noticed 
the note stuck to the fridge door with a magnet.

&quot;Maya, I wasn&#39;t feeling well so I went to bed early. I stocked the 
fridge, so help yourself to dinner if you&#39;re hungry. Sorry I&#39;m not here 
to welcome you back personally, but I&#39;ll see you in the morning, 
Ritsuko.&quot;

Maya pulled the note off the door with a sigh. It looked like she 
wouldn&#39;t be seeing Ritsuko this evening after all. She once again 
glanced around the flat, allowing her eyes to rest for a moment on her 
suitcase. What was this place to her? Home? A stopgap? Just another 
Hotel? None of those names seemed to fit. It was a nice apartment, the 
area of the city it was in wasn&#39;t the most pleasant but it was close to 
Nerv HQ, but something still felt so uncomfortable, almost as if she 
could never really belong here. She suddenly felt a sense of panic; what 
if she couldn&#39;t find anywhere else? What if she ended up staying for any 
extended period of time? The tension she felt due to her unspeakable 
feelings was already gnawing at her inside, twisting her stomach and 
increasing her heart rate every time she looked at Ritsuko now. 
Moreover, was she being presumptuous for imagining that Ritsuko would 
allow her to stay for more than a few nights? Maya was beginning to 
regret ever agreeing to go home with Ritsuko, but last night Dr Akagi 
had shown her kindness and compassion she had so desperately needed. 
Maya barely knew what to think anymore, she curled up on the sofa and 
began to sob once again, each inhalation filling her senses with the 
scent of Ritsuko.

&quot;sempai.&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

The streetlamps outside the window gave the white ceiling a dim orange 
hue. How long had she been staring up at it? Forty minutes? An hour? 
Ritsuko sighed, cursed her insomnia, and listened. She had heard Maya 
come in and walk around, but now what was she doing? The other bedroom 
door hadn&#39;t been closed, or at least, she hadn&#39;t heard it, and years of 
living alone had taught her to recognise each minute sound that happened 
in her apartment. She strained her ears a little more. Was that.? It 
was, undeniably, muffled sobs, Maya was crying. Attempting to ignore the 
growing awkwardness she felt around Maya, she left her bed for the 
living room. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;Maya?&quot; She didn&#39;t look up. Ritsuko sat down next to her and Maya 
whimpered slightly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.you shouldn&#39;t.I don&#39;t want.you to see me like this.I-I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; Ritsuko smiled softly and shook her head.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, cry if you need to, I shan&#39;t think any less of you for it.&quot; 
It hurt the older woman to see Maya like this but she still wasn&#39;t sure 
of how to act. She opted to go with her instinct and moved a little 
closer to Maya, cradling the brunette&#39;s head in her lap. Maya&#39;s tears 
began to soak through the hem of Ritsuko&#39;s silk nightshirt but she 
couldn&#39;t have cared less as she gently began to stroke Maya&#39;s hair. 
&quot;Shhh, it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s alright.&quot; Ritsuko could feel a warmth spreading 
through her being, a feeling of overwhelming compassion and tenderness 
that brought tears to her eyes. There was no suspicion however that Maya 
may have been feeling the same.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Maya&#39;s sobbing calmed after a while before evolving into the deep, slow 
rise and fall of sleep. Ritsuko was more than a little tempted to stay 
there all night, content to listen to the soothing sounds of Maya&#39;s 
peaceful slumber. The feeling of physical contact with one she cared for 
so deeply was treasured but she was more worried about how it may look 
to Maya in the morning, to find herself still being watched over. 
Besides, Ritsuko really wanted a good night&#39;s sleep in her own bed. Very 
slowly and carefully she shifted her knees from under Maya&#39;s head and 
smoothly replaced them with a sofa cushion. She then brought a spare 
blanket from her own bedroom and gently placed it over her dormant 
guest, once again feeling the urge to stay there all night, just 
watching the woman she loved so dearly at peace and it was with regret 
that she began to move back to her room, when Maya whispered a little in 
her sleep.

&quot;Sempai.&quot; The blonde woman&#39;s eyes widened and she pivoted instantly back 
to face the sofa. Had she heard correctly? Was Maya calling for her in 
her sleep? A sudden need to yawn reminded her of how tired she was and 
she guessed that that must be it, her exhausted mind was probably 
playing tricks on her, but she couldn&#39;t shake the slight bit of comfort 
she had drawn from what she thought she had heard.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Thursday moved into Friday and daytime shifted into evening with no 
major occurrences. The only thing that had been significant, at least to 
Ritsuko, was giving Maya her own key to the flat. Ordinarily she 
wouldn&#39;t have entrusted it to someone who had been with her for such a 
short period of time, but it seemed only fair to allow Maya the option 
of coming and going as she pleased. She had surprised herself in how 
apprehensive she had been about handing over the physically 
insignificant piece of metal, but having to ensure that they were both 
either at home or work at the same time was a restriction upon the 
freedom of both of them. Besides, if Maya was only staying for a few 
days it wasn&#39;t exactly the substantial commitment it would have been for 
somebody moving in permanently.

But these thoughts were not foremost in mind as she prepared to go out 
on Friday evening. It turned out that Maya had made plans with Shigeru 
and Makoto that night. Maya had seemed much happier for the past two 
days, although Ritsuko suspected she was hiding a lot of her true 
feelings from her. Still, there was a lot to be said for putting a brave 
face on inner pain, wasn&#39;t there? She knew that, she was living proof of 
that a lot of the time. She smiled as she slipped on her flat blue 
sandals, years of barhopping with Misato had taught her the perils of 
wearing high heels. Besides, it was a hot night and the shoes went well 
with the plain blue shift dress she was wearing. Light enough to keep 
cool but not revealing enough to attract unwanted attention, more 
specifically male attention. Giving herself a once-over in the bedroom 
mirror, she resolved to have a good time that night, no matter what.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Maya came out of her room just as Ritsuko was headed for the front door. 
They each paused to get a look at what the other was wearing. Maya 
looked understatedly cute in a violet halterneck top and cropped indigo 
jeans, with simple black kitten-heeled sandals on her feet. Her fringe 
was casually swept away from her face and held in place with a purple 
barrette.

They both had to fight to keep their jaws from dropping as they surveyed 
each other; both convinced they were looking at one of the most 
beautiful women in the world.

&quot;You look nice, Ritsuko.&quot; The blonde woman suddenly felt self-conscious, 
she even blushed a little as she pushed a few strands of hair behind her 
ear.

&quot;Oh, thankyou, so do you, I wish I could pull off a bare midriff as well 
as you.&quot; Maya laughed awkwardly.

&quot;Um, I might not come back here tonight, just to let you know in 
advance, I usually end up crashing at Aoba&#39;s after we go out, he lives a 
little closer to the city centre.&quot; Ritsuko nodded.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be at Misato&#39;s if I don&#39;t come back here, so it&#39;s best not 
to wait up for me.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Have a good evening!&quot;</pre>
