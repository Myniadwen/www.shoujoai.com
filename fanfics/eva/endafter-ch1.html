<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Third 
Impact. The end of everything and the beginning of the new genesis. 
It was safe to say, it wasn&#39;t quite what Asuka would have expected. 
For a start, it would have been a lot more believable if things hadn&#39;t 
returned to how they had been before the arrival of the angels quite 
so quickly. Not her life, obviously, that had been fundamentally and 
irrevocably changed during the cataclysmic events linked to the coming 
of the angels and to the process of instrumentality itself. Dark memories 
from dark times. When she closed her eyes, she could still see the giant 
limbs and the blank face and eyes of the being that had been Rei (one 
of so many different Rei&#39;s it seemed) but had been reduced to monolithic 
human parts bathed in a red sea straight out of the book of revelations.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Not 
the other&#39;s lives either: Gendo, Ritsuko and Kaji were still dead. Misato, 
while miraculously alive (something for which Asuka believed Shinji 
was responsible), had yet to come to terms with the death of her love, 
let alone her own resurrection. Shinji himself was a wreck even now, 
his mind still recovering from experiences no human should have to go 
through and Asuka thought that he would never be quite the same again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No, 
what was surprising was how the red seas had receded, how the gargantuan 
remains had faded away, how quickly greenery had returned and the cities 
had been rebuilt. The world returned and so did the countless masses 
of ordinary people, each wanting to return to their day to day lives. </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Again, 
Asuka was vaguely aware that Shinji was responsible for this somehow, 
but she was unable to work out why that should be. It didn&#39;t help that 
her former comrade in arms (if never quite her companion in life) had 
taken it upon himself to go into a period of extended exile and had 
seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth, telling her no more 
than &#39;he would be safe&#39; before he did so. Asuka found she didn&#39;t mind 
him taking a sabbatical; there had been a time when she had wanted to 
be with the troubled young man, even if she hadn&#39;t been quite able to 
admit it to herself at the time, but those feelings had been lost amidst 
the horrors she had encountered before and after her death (and for 
some reason, still remembered). Perhaps one day they could be reignited, 
though this time hopefully in a less destructive form and when Shinji 
was better equipped to receive them, but until that time might come 
around, what she really felt now was numb.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
terrible truth about her life post apocalypse was that she was lost. 
Not in the way she had been, when she had been torn apart beneath her 
tough veneer by the pain of her past and of her mother&#39;s suicide, this 
was an entirely new form of lost. She was alone, not as she had been 
before, surrounded by people who didn&#39;t understand her, by people she 
abused and blocked out, but now alone in the true meaning of the word.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
hell of it, as it seemed to her, was that the rest of the world seemed 
to be healing just fine. Sitting in a café filled with smiling, 
grateful people, she reflected on how these humans were so different 
from the ones that had inhabited the lands before. Times were still 
hard, but the collective knowledge of what they had all been through 
seemed to have changed humanity into a more caring and collective kind 
of people, less ready to lash out and more ready to tolerate hardship 
in order to help others as well as themselves. The old flaws and negative 
personality traits still existed, of course, mankind hadn&#39;t been transformed 
into smiling robots. More, they were caught amid the still swelling 
feelings of relief that they had been tested and had come through. That 
mankind had been close to the brink of self wrought annihilation, and 
yet, contrary to all expectations, had turned away and been saved.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Not 
that this held much comfort for Asuka. Every part of her life had been 
stripped away by those events. Her friends and colleagues had all but 
disappeared, her feelings of love – for Shinji, for Kaji – had vanished. 
Even the conflict within her, surrounding her mother, had been quelled; 
her mother had been damaged, she knew that now, partly by Asuka&#39;s father 
leaving her and partly by her own hand. Asuka may have been caught in 
the turbulent wake of that event, but she had finally realised that 
her mother had indeed loved her, in her own way. So, what she was left 
with was emptiness and solitude.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still, 
life had to go on. And go on it did, quite impressively so. The new 
city which had sprung up near to the ruins of Tokyo 3 (and which had 
fittingly been named Kaibyaku) already had several tall buildings and 
plenty of small businesses. In fact, Kaibyaku was already comparatively 
bustling, considering its construction so far had only taken a year 
and a half. Asuka had taken to going to cafés as a means of escaping 
her small and silent apartment, and it was in one of these cafés that 
she now sat, reflecting absently on her life. After Third Impact, she 
had found that she couldn&#39;t face making new acquaintances, a big change 
from the formally brash and outgoing girl she had once been. This was 
just another thing that disturbed her about her new life. In one of 
the cafés she had been going to, the owner had become familiar with 
her and on a couple of occasions had attempted conversation. She stopped 
going there and, after that, attempted to avoid frequenting any cafés 
or bars or even shops and public places, preferring to move around the 
city and keep herself to herself. The cafe she was sitting in right 
now was quite a way from the tenements that had been assigned to her 
by the new &#39;people&#39;s council&#39; that served as government for this city 
during the period of change everyone was going through, but that was 
fine, because there was no one here who might recognise her.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No, 
that was a lie. Everyone recognised her, at least on some level. They 
all had varying degrees of recollection of the events Asuka had a hand 
in shaping and so she was often the recipient of double takes and mistaken 
greetings. They knew her, because Shinji knew her. Asuka didn&#39;t know 
how that was possible, but she felt strongly that it was the case. What 
was different here was that nobody had any real relation to her, so 
she was rarely bothered by them. And that was fine.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Technically 
she wasn&#39;t entirely alone, of course. Maya (whom she had previously 
known solely as Lieutenant Ibuki) was also somewhere in the city and 
had even offered company should Asuka require it. However, Maya didn&#39;t 
seem to have taken her own resurrection quite so calmly as Asuka had; 
she couldn&#39;t understand or accept her own life, when others – in particular 
Doctor Ritsuko – were not similarly blessed. The former administrator 
and technician had taken to drinking a little more heavily than was 
healthy and, although she was making more progress at rebuilding her 
life than Asuka had so far managed, her &#39;company&#39; complete with drunken 
rants and fits of weeping, was often more painful than comforting.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
so she had begun avoiding meeting with Maya. Hikari moved away, as did 
Touji (though she had never really been friends with him, or Kensuke 
who hadn&#39;t returned at all). And of course Shinji had disappeared, and 
shortly after, Misato had followed him. Most likely in the literal sense 
of the word. Asuka got the impression that feelings for the cowardly 
and yet courageous boy had stirred within Misato shortly before the 
events of Third Impact, and what with Kaji&#39;s status remaining firmly 
in the deceased column post apocalypse, she had decided that these feelings 
weren&#39;t necessarily things to be discouraged.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
sipped the sweet black coffee that had gone cold a while ago without 
her noticing and stared, unseeing, at the wooden table top before her. 
Again, there had been a time when knowing these things would have ignited 
passionate responses towards the Major, but those times seemed long 
gone. Now she was alone. Now she was empty, surrounded by happy, relieved 
people and feeling none of it. What she needed, she decided without 
even really thinking about it, was some kind of shock. Something to 
shake her up and make her feel like she was a part of this world again 
and not just some ghostly interloper upon a place that reminded her 
of home.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
thought was there and gone so quickly she never even remembered having 
it afterwards. This, of course, was in part because almost immediately 
after having this thought, she actually did receive a shock that very 
nearly had the desired effect, in itself.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
heard the door to the café open and was aware of a sudden dip 
in the chatter that flew about the room. Looking up to discover the 
reason for the hush, she was faced with a sight that she at once knew 
was utterly impossible. But then, the impossible very often became possible 
around those that had once worked for Nerv, as was being proved here 
once again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Standing 
in the doorway, still and quiet and staring directly at her, was a vision 
straight out of her nightmares; the figure of Rei Ayanami, the first 
child, the aloof and emotionless girl that had so frustrated and enraged 
the fiery redhead during their time at Nerv. She was alive. She was 
standing before her, looking as blank as ever and yet, piercing Asuka 
with her vermillion gaze.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka&#39;s 
eyes widened in horror. Her throat closed up, the lights around her 
suddenly became too bright and the world seemed to white out, the sounds 
of the hushed café drowned by electric silence ringing in her ears.</font> <br>
