&quot;Maya!&quot; Ritsuko sprinted after her. The younger woman was quick and 
agile but the heels of her shoes added to her drunken staggering were no 
small handicap. Ritsuko&#39;s legs were longer and her footwear slightly 
easier to run in. &quot;Maya!&quot; The brunette tried to pay no attention to her 
pursuer and maintained her pace as best she could.

&quot;No.no...no, please, this isn&#39;t happening.&quot; Ritsuko had almost caught up 
to her when a crack in the pavement sent Maya sprawling to the floor 
with a minimum of dignity. She ignored the hot pain exploding in her 
left wrist and tried to pull herself to her feet, about to set off again 
but it was too late, Ritsuko had drawn level with her.

&quot;Maya!&quot;

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; She was sobbing harder than ever before. She stared 
down at the floor, panting heavily. &quot;Get the hell away from me!&quot;

&quot;Maya, look at me.&quot;

&quot;Fuck off!&quot; Tears beginning to fall down her own face, Ritsuko lost more 
than a little of her control and grabbed Maya by the shoulders, holding 
her firmly against a wall.

&quot;Would you just listen to me for five seconds!&quot;

&quot;No! No, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean those things I said, let me go, 
please, oh God I&#39;m sorry, please, I&#39;m so pathetic, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t 
mean it, please, I-&quot; She was cut off in mid speech by Ritsuko&#39;s lips 
pressing tenderly against hers. They stayed there for a few seconds, 
before Ritsuko pulled away. It didn&#39;t calm her completely but the 
gesture managed to restore at least some of her coherence. However, it 
seemed to have angered Maya more than anything. &quot;What the hell did you 
do that for?&quot; Ritsuko tried to place her hands on Maya&#39;s waist but was 
pushed away. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare, your girlfriend might see.&quot;

&quot;Maya, don&#39;t you get it? Misato and I aren&#39;t together, and everything 
you just said.&quot; Her voice was cracking as she tried to speak to her, 
desperate to hold her close. &quot;I understand, Maya.&quot; Maya finally looked 
her in the face, her brown eyes wide and apologetic. She reached out her 
right hand and took one of Ritsuko&#39;s, interlacing her fingers with those 
of her sempai. Ritsuko took a step closer to her. &quot;I love you.&quot;</pre>
