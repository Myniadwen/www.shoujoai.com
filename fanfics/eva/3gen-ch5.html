<h1>Third Genesis (part 5 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        She didn&#39;t know exactly what it was, that woke her up from her 
deep sleep. Something had disturbed her, some unidentified sound, or 
maybe a familiar presence. Her eyes gradually opened up, first 
observing her surroundings, the tank full of liquid that she floated 
in, then looking outward to those who were gathered outside.

        A tall, blonde haired woman in a lab coat stood beside a 
shorter, boyish looking dark haired girl in gray military garb. Not 
too far away from them, a dark haired woman in a bright red jacket 
stood alone watching other two. Finally, a much younger woman looked 
over at the tank itself, standing out with her shocking mane of bright 
red hair. Her two eyes met the girl&#39;s one, and she saw the redhead&#39;s 
eye widen in surprise.

        &quot;She&#39;s awake,&quot; the redhead blurted out.

        The blonde turned, looking first at the redhead then her 
before trailing of in surprise, &quot;Asuka, she can&#39;t be...&quot;

        &#39;Asuka,&#39; she thought, feeling some deep satisfaction rising 
within her, at being able to name the oddly familiar red haired girl 
at last.

        The dark haired older woman grabbed the blonde&#39;s arm and 
asked, &quot;Ritsuko, will she be all right in there?&quot;

        &quot;She should be, Misato,&quot; Ritsuko looked at Rei thoughtfully, 
&quot;it&#39;s the same fluid we used in the entry plugs to protect the 
pilots.&quot;

        It was strange, hearing those three names spoken aloud. She 
recognized them all, somehow, even though she knew that she had never 
seen them before today. She looked over at the smaller girl, trying to 
place her as well. There was a name on the tip of her tongue, but it 
slipped out of her mental grasp like water.

        &quot;Maya,&quot; Ritsuko turned to the shorter girl, &quot;Go grab a uniform 
in her size.&quot;

        &quot;Right, Sempai,&quot; and Maya bolted.

        &quot;You aren&#39;t seriously considering letting her out of there,&quot; a 
frowning Misato said, sounding quite irritable.

        The girl in the tube was a little surprised to hear Asuka 
speak up for her angrily, &quot;We can&#39;t just leave her in there.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Ritsuko said, sounding quite gentle.

        She saw Misato looking at her, and she met the dark haired 
woman&#39;s gaze calmly. Misato was the first one to turn away, sighing, 
&quot;I guess you&#39;re right.&quot;

        &quot;Start pumping the fluid out,&quot; Ritsuko ordered the other 
scientists, &quot;and then replace it with a standard oxygen blend.&quot;

        She felt a moment of panic, as her environment began to 
change, but she quelled it forcefully. She tasted the air, smelling 
the tang of medicine and ozone in it, the scent of a science lab at 
work. She breathed deep, and it strangely felt like home.

        In only a few moments she stood dry in the middle of the 
sealed tank. Ritsuko herself then stepped forward, grasping the 
catches set on the side of the tank. &quot;Opening,&quot; she unsnapped them 
loudly one at a time, &quot;now.&quot;

        The blue haired girl stepped carefully out of the tank into 
the outside world, taking a breath of the air out there. She took 
another step but stumbled, suddenly falling, when strong arms grasped 
her, preventing any injury.

        &#39;Asuka,&#39; she thought dazedly, looking up into the eye not 
covered by the black eye-patch.

        &quot;Who are you?&quot; Asuka asked her softly.

        She paused, and the name came to her much easier than any of 
the other ones had. &quot;Rei,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;Rei Ayanami.&quot;

        Maya arrived a few moments later, carrying another NERV 
uniform. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she handed the pile of clothes to her.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei found herself saying softly before she began 
to pull the uniform on over her naked body. It felt a little strange, 
she noticed, because she was expecting it to be more skin-tight. &#39;Plug 
suit&#39; she thought, unsure of what that name referred to.

        &quot;Rei,&quot; Misato asked her quietly, &quot;what do you remember?&quot;

        Sitting on a bench Rei looked up to meet her dark eyes, 
knowing that the question was very important to the woman. &quot;Nothing,&quot; 
she said softly. At Misato&#39;s confused look Rei quietly explained, &quot;I 
know who you and the others are, I know that I&#39;m in Tokyo-3, but I 
don&#39;t know how or why I know that. The knowledge is just... there.&quot;

        Misato nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rei responded to her automatically.

        Rei looked around, noticing that Ritsuko was leaning over a 
console, one that looked like it was tied into the medical monitoring 
devices. She and several other scientists were talking together quite 
excitably, but Rei could only hear fragments of their conversation: 
&quot;the bio-scans read human norms...&quot; &quot;if she has any of ADAM&#39;s DNA, 
it&#39;s recessive..&quot; &quot;far less anemic than was previously recorded...&quot; 
&quot;certainly looks much more healthy..&quot;

        A figure settled down beside her, and Rei turned to look at 
Asuka. The redhead smiled slightly at her, &quot;You really don&#39;t remember 
anything?&quot;

        Rei shook her head, &quot;No.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe that&#39;s a good thing,&quot; Asuka said to her softly, &quot;I know 
that there are some things that I&#39;d love to forget.&quot; She smiled at Rei 
slightly, &quot;This time, maybe we can be friends.&quot;

        &#39;This time?&#39; Rei thought curiously.

        In an oddly old-fashioned looking gesture Asuka offered her 
hand to be shaken as she said, &quot;My name is Asuka Langley.&quot;

        Rei shook it gently, &quot;I know.&quot; A smile, &quot;My name is Rei 
Ayanami.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; Asuka smiled slightly, a bit of humor in her eyes.

        A brown haired scientist bustled over to them, roughly 
grabbing at Rei&#39;s arm and saying, &quot;We need to get a blood sample.&quot;

        Rei didn&#39;t even see Asuka move, she was up out of her seat 
that fast. She grabbed his wrist and squeezed it hard, making him 
release Rei&#39;s arm with a gasp of pain. Angrily she growled at him, 
&quot;You could at least ask her politely.&quot;

        Rei put her hand gently on Asuka&#39;s, &quot;It&#39;s all right, he&#39;s just 
doing his job.&quot; With obvious reluctance, Asuka let him go.

        &quot;If so, he&#39;s doing it badly,&quot; Asuka glared.

        The man rubbed his sore wrist, keeping an careful eye on Asuka 
even as he asked Rei, &quot;Could I please get a blood sample?&quot; Rei simply 
pushed up her shirt sleeve, revealing the bare arm underneath. He got 
his sample, then all but fled.

        Rei wasn&#39;t quite sure what to say as she looked over at Asuka, 
so she smiled at her and simply said, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;

        Asuka&#39;s cheeks went a bit red, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

        A few moments later Asuka was called away, and Rei watched her 
go with a curious expression on her face. Asuka, Misato, ad Ritsuko 
were talking over to the side, keeping their voices down so that they 
couldn&#39;t be overheard.

        Finally Misato separated from the others, walking over to Rei 
silently. &quot;We were just talking about you,&quot; she smiled, &quot;when I 
realized we should probably ask you, first.&quot;

        &quot;Ask me about what?&quot; Rei asked Misato quietly. She wasn&#39;t used 
to being asked things, given options for her to choose from.

        &quot;I was wondering if you would like to stay in my apartment, 
along with me and Asuka?&quot; Misato asked her simply.

        Rei hesitated, looking over to gaze at Asuka. The redhead 
smiled slightly, and Rei looked back at Misato to say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;d like 
to.&quot;
