<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When 
Asuka came to, mere moments later, the apparition hadn&#39;t moved. She 
still stood in the doorway, looking exactly as she had when Asuka saw 
her last. She wore her white plug suit and had old blood-stained bandages 
on her left hand and over her left eye. There were probably more bandages 
beneath the suit, but Asuka couldn&#39;t see these. Asuka, on the other 
hand, looked completely different from the time she had been at Nerv; 
she wore old clothes and a long and scuffed brown jacket to cover them, 
her red hair was a little longer and much more unkempt than it had once 
been, and her clear blue eyes held none of the fire that had made her 
such a formidable young lady. However, as she sat in shock, staring 
at the old comrade that seemed to have stepped straight out of her nightmares, 
a brief flicker of that old fire returned and then was gone again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Pilot 
Soryuu...&quot; said the girl. And then nothing more. There was no way 
for Asuka to tell whether this was a greeting, a call for help, or the 
knell like accusation of a literary phantom. Rei&#39;s voice was as flat 
and emotionless as it ever had been.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
was a clattering sound as one of the patrons stood abruptly, knocking 
his chair spinning. He pointed a shaking finger at Rei and cried out 
in a voice that bordered on hysteria.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s 
her! The monster from the end!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
collective gasp went around the room.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Is 
it happening again?&quot; asked another, terror evident in his own voice, 
&quot;Is she here to do it all again?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
didn&#39;t even seem to hear the men. She stood silently for another moment 
her eye fixed on Asuka and then repeated,</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Pilot 
Soryuu.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
stood slowly and felt every pair of eyes in the room turn on her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Is 
this real?” she asked, her voice unsteady, “Are you here for me?&quot; 
Rei nodded.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;There 
was no one else... I...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
was different. Asuka had never heard indecision or uncertainty in Ayanami&#39;s 
voice before. A sudden buzz went round the room, that quietened quickly 
as Asuka stepped forward. She looked around her at the thunderstruck 
people, all staring at her, then quickened her pace, reaching Rei&#39;s 
side and seizing her hand. Asuka dragged her swiftly outside, where 
she stopped and fumbled in her pockets for the key that started the 
old Nissan she had managed to scrounge enough money together to buy 
recently. Rei stood by her side, plug suit and all, a vision of the 
hell Asuka thought she had escaped, making any kind of structured thought 
impossible.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Pilot 
Soryuu?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
are you here?&quot; asked Asuka, avoiding looking at her old colleague.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
asked to be,&quot; replied Rei, simply.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Behind 
them, the door to the cafe opened. Asuka grabbed Rei&#39;s hand again, pulling 
her down the street to where she had parked her car. It was battered 
and green, something she wouldn&#39;t have been caught dead getting into 
not so long ago. Slotting the key into the lock, she opened it and held 
the door for Ayanami.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Get 
in,&quot; she instructed. Rei complied and Asuka quickly moved around 
to the other side and climbed in herself. A moment later the car started 
and she pulled out into the sparse traffic.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Twenty 
minutes later they were entering Asuka&#39;s apartment. The car journey 
had been hellish for her; looking at Rei had been extremely difficult 
and questions had continuously tumbled through her mind, questions that 
fear prevented her from asking. She didn&#39;t know why she had taken Rei 
with her, why she hadn&#39;t just run away screaming. That was what her 
mind had most wanted her to do, and now, entering the closed environment 
of her dwelling, the desire to do so was growing ever stronger.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei, 
on the other hand, had remained silent in the car. She never made any 
threatening gesture, nor displayed any of the terrifying magic she had 
demonstrated just prior to and during Third Impact. There was something 
about her manner, though, that was different from before. She didn&#39;t 
quite seem comfortable (if comfortable was the right word for one so 
interminably separate as her) in the car, as if she wanted to say something, 
but couldn&#39;t come close to even beginning to form words.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
held the door open once again as Rei moved into her last refuge, and 
she fought the urge to push her back out and barricade the entrance. 
When Rei had passed inside, Asuka closed the door and then turned to 
face her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
are you here?&quot; she blurted out, all the tension from the car journey 
suddenly spilling free.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
asked to –&quot; started Rei, beginning to repeat what she had said 
on the street.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;NO! 
Why are you here right now!&quot; cried Asuka, &quot;Why have you come 
to me?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;There 
was no one else...&quot; said Rei, &quot;I... the commander is dead...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
know that!&quot; snapped Asuka, &quot;You killed him!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
bowed her head.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
couldn&#39;t go to him because he is dead,&quot; she said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t 
go to Shinji, because he told me not to.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
I&#39;m telling you not to come to me!&quot; yelled Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
nodded. She turned away towards the door, making to open it and leave.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
the hell?!&quot; cried Asuka, incredulously, &quot;You come all this 
way, you come back to life to see me and then you just leave?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
asked me to leave,&quot; replied Rei, looking round, confusion creeping 
into her voice.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Are 
you real?!&quot; said Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
nodded again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Are 
you alive and here right now? This isn&#39;t just a nightmare I&#39;m having, 
is it?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s 
not,&quot; replied Rei.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then 
why are you here? What do you want from me?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
need... help... your help. There wasn&#39;t anyone else.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
again looked uncomfortable, like she was struggling with something she 
didn&#39;t understand.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
not here to start Fourth Impact?&quot; asked Asuka. Rei shook her head. 
&quot;You&#39;re not here to kill me?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
should I do that?&quot; asked Rei, her brow furrowing slightly. She 
took a step forward and Asuka flinched slightly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This 
isn&#39;t like me</i>, she thought, <i>I&#39;m behaving like a frightened kitten 
when it&#39;s obvious she means me no harm</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still, 
the memories she carried, the ones she seemed to have been given by 
Shinji, and in particular the ones about her death and what happened 
shortly after, clamoured in her mind every time she looked at the pilot 
of Unit 00.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Because 
that&#39;s what she still is, even after all 
this time</i>. <i>She looks like she&#39;s just stepped out of her Eva five 
minutes ago</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
had stopped at Asuka&#39;s flinch. There was again a look of uncertainty 
on her face that would never have been there normally.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... 
think I need a coffee,&quot; said Asuka after a long moment in which 
they simply stared at each other. &quot;Would you like a coffee?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
nodded the affirmative, standing irresolutely in Asuka&#39;s entrance hall. 
The red head sighed, some of the tension leaving her body. It was now 
obvious that she wasn&#39;t a danger. In fact, if anything, Rei looked more 
lost than Asuka felt.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
come in then, Wonder Girl.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
led her into the small lounge area that the little apartment afforded 
her and then once Rei was seated at her kotatsu, Asuka went into the 
kitchen to prepare coffee. She found her hands were shaking more than 
a little and she couldn&#39;t help spilling granules over her work surface 
as she made up a cafetière and boiled the water. She also couldn&#39;t 
seem to help herself drinking the first cup she poured in three quick 
gulps, before she poured another for herself and one for Rei. She found 
milk sugar and cream and placed them all on a tray and carried them 
back into the other room. The crockery clinked loudly in her still shaking 
hands as she placed the tray on the kotatsu.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
didn&#39;t know how you liked it... so I brought everything...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
didn&#39;t answer, just as she so often hadn&#39;t when they had been at Nerv 
together. It had used to infuriate Asuka to no end, but right now she 
was too nervous to be annoyed. The blue haired girl sat placidly at 
the kotatsu, her hands resting in her lap, staring at nothing in particular 
as Asuka sat down.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Are... 
you okay?&quot; she asked Rei and the other girl looked at her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
am healthy, I think. My eye hurts. The rest of me has healed since the 
last mission.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Since 
the last mission? Does that mean since the last angel or since we all 
died? </i>wondered Asuka.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Where 
have you been all this time? A year and a half has passed since Third 
Impact.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked at her blankly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think I would understand if I did.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yet 
you turn up now, completely out of the blue?&quot; said Asuka, &quot;You 
scare me half to death and –&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
are different,&quot; said Rei, suddenly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of 
course I&#39;m different!&quot; snapped Asuka, &quot;Anyone would be different 
after the things I&#39;ve been through!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
also the same,&quot; said Rei, her blank expression never faltering. 
To Asuka&#39;s astonishment, she saw that underneath the blankness there 
was actually something there. Something like curiosity. Or wonder, perhaps.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
sighed and sat back, looking at Rei carefully.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
have you come back now?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
came back because I chose to,&quot; replied Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Right, 
right, and you came to me because there was no one else... hang on, 
you said just now that Shinji told you not to go to him?&quot; Rei nodded. 
&quot;You&#39;ve seen Shinji?&quot; pressed Asuka. Rei nodded again.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;He 
said he couldn&#39;t help me. He has his own struggle.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;ve 
seen Shinji...&quot; repeated Asuka, more to herself than Rei, though 
the blue haired girl obediently nodded again. Asuka chewed her lip, 
subconsciously. &quot;How was he?&quot; she asked, after a pause.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;He 
was healthy,&quot; replied Rei, but then, sensing she needed to say 
more: &quot;he looked thin. He is still struggling with his world.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>His 
world</i>, thought Asuka. Rei was probably right, this <i>was</i> his 
world. The world he had recreated after Third Impact. It seemed that 
the experiences he had had were too much to contain himself and he had 
given everyone, all the people on the planet it seemed, Asuka included, 
at least some of the memories of the final few hours of the old world. 
Which was how Asuka knew a little of how Gendo and Ritsuko and even 
Kaji had died. It was also how Asuka knew of events after her own demise 
and prior to her subsequent resurrection.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
suddenly realised that neither of the pair had yet touched their coffees. 
She sat forwards depositing two spoonfuls of sugar into her black coffee 
and stirring it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
should drink that before it gets cold,&quot; she told Rei, &quot;how 
do you like it?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Rei. She reached out her hand to the cup and 
lifted it slowly to her lips, taking a small sip.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Warm,&quot; 
she said, &quot;bitter.&quot; She looked at Asuka. &quot;Is that good?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
flushed, partly with annoyance, partly with embarrassment.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
my coffee should be good,&quot; she snapped, &quot;it always used to 
be, but then, as you say, I&#39;ve changed. Anyway, are you saying you don&#39;t 
know whether you like it?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;ve 
never attached importance to taste before,&quot; replied Rei, quietly. 
She looked at Asuka again, her one good eye wide and red. &quot;Is taste 
important in life?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
kind of question is that?!&quot; cried Asuka, &quot;Of course it&#39;s important. 
What you like and dislike is a fundamental for normal people.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
not a normal person,&quot; said Rei.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
can say that again, Wonder Girl!&quot; agreed Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
are not a normal person, either,&quot; said Rei, &quot;but taste is 
important to you?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
obviously wasn&#39;t intended as an attack, but Asuka chose to take it that 
way because it meant she didn&#39;t have to deal with the uncomfortable 
first half of the statement.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fine!&quot; 

she said, irritably. She stood and made her way to the kitchen again, 
returning with several more coffee cups. &quot;Like is easy,&quot; she 
stated, as she retook her seat and set the cups up before Rei, &quot;try 
that coffee again, then try adding some milk, or some sugar and see 
which way you prefer it.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Prefer?&quot; 
asked Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Which 
one you&#39;d like to keep drinking if you only had one choice.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Choice...&quot; 

said Rei, &quot;yes, I chose to come here, I have choice.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
sipped the coffee again and then picked up the milk jug, carefully pouring 
a small measure into the cup.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Different,&quot; 
she said once she had sampled it, &quot;less bitter... Smoother...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
found herself watching intently, enthralled by this display of methodical 
discovery. She poured another cup and added some sugar then handed it 
to Rei, who tasted it carefully.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sweet, 
but still bitter.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;That&#39;s 
how I take it nowadays,&quot; said Asuka. She poured another cup and 
added cream this time.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thicker,&quot; 
said Rei, &quot;a little cloying...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;There 
you go,&quot; said Asuka, &quot;&#39;cloying&#39; is definitely an emotional 
response, something I never thought I&#39;d get out of you at least. Some 
people like it like that though... You can try any combination, you 
know, with different measurements of each substance.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Measurements 
of each substance?</i> thought Asuka, <i>That sounded like something 
Rei would have said</i>. <i>She&#39;s been back five minutes and already 
her manner is affecting me</i>...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
she marvelled at how, in the space of thirty minutes, she had gone from 
fearing for her life to mere mild annoyance at the one who had caused 
the Third Impact. She&#39;d even slipped back into the old nickname without 
even noticing it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Though 
that was slightly unfair</i>, she thought, <i>Rei may have been the 
catalyst, but it was Gendo that had manipulated her, pushing her towards 
the final cataclysm</i>. <i>It was Gendo&#39;s selfishness in trying to 
bring back his dead wife that had brought about the conditions suitable 
for Third Impact to take place</i>.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, 
that may have been true, but what was also true was that they were each 
partly responsible. From Shinji to Ritsuko and Misato to herself. Even 
Kaji had a hand, through throwing his life away when he could have been 
searching for a way to stop what was going to happen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Five 
minutes passed as Rei experimented and sampled various coffee concoctions, 
seemingly unaware of a now calm (and slightly bemused) Asuka watching 
her intently.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... <i>
prefer</i> this one,&quot; said Rei finally holding up the black coffee 
with one sugar, looking to Asuka for some kind of affirmation. Asuka 
was still watching her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Is 
that why you came here? To find out what kind of coffee you like?&quot; 

she asked. Rei didn&#39;t answer. &quot;Come on, Wonder Girl, you can tell 
me after coming all this way.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
came here because I chose to live,&quot; replied Rei slowly. And again 
she looked like she was struggling with something.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;And 
you want me to show you how to live?&quot; asked Asuka. Rei shook her 
head.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
want you to tell me <i>why</i> I chose to live,&quot; she replied.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
answer quite took her by surprise.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
me?&quot; asked Asuka, &quot;Why not Maya, or Misato, or any of the 
other survivors?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
never talked to Lieutenant Ibuki, or Hikari, or anyone else apart from 
Shinji and you and Major Katsuragi and Commander Ikari. I could not 
go to Major Katsuragi because of her proximity to Shinji –&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Well, 
I was right about that, then,</i> thought Asuka.</font></p>

<p align="justify">            <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;– I could not go 
to Commander 
Ikari because he is dead,&quot; finished Rei. She actually looked a 
little drained at saying so much at once, but sudden indignation was 
flaring in Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;d 
actually go back to that bastard even after what he did to you?&quot; 
she asked. Rei nodded.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;He 
created me, he is the reason I exist at all.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bullshit!&quot; 

cried the young German, &quot;If he were alive, I&#39;d kill the bastard 
before letting you go back to him!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
said nothing, but for once, this didn&#39;t enrage Asuka more. Instead, 
she sat back on her hands and sighed.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
may have changed, but you sure as hell haven&#39;t much,&quot; said Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not 
much time has passed for me since Third Impact,&quot; replied Rei, evenly. 
Asuka regarded her for a moment.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;How 
long have you been... back?&quot; she asked.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Four 
weeks,&quot; the blue haired girl replied, &quot;I found Shinji easily, 
but finding you was harder.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Four 
weeks,&quot; mused Asuka, &quot;and I bet you haven&#39;t changed out of 
that plug suit once, have you? Where are you staying?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
have no residence,&quot; said Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
smacked her forehead.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Geez! 
What am I going to do with you? How long is it since you washed?&quot; 
Again, Rei declined to answer. &quot;Right! The first thing we&#39;re going 
to do is get you out of that suit and into a hot bath.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
stood purposefully and walked round the table to where Rei was sitting.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Come 
on,&quot; she said, holding out her hand. Rei looked at it for a second 
and then joined it with her own.</font> <br> <br></p>
