<h1>Third Genesis (part 25 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>The EVA Unit-00 moved hesitantly, the giant purple
figure slipping from it&#39;s restraints to take one step,
then another. The single eye gazed about intently as
it moved through the underground chamber, jerky
motions eventually being smoothed out.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Yui Ikari murmured, the young boy&#39;s body
she wore dressed in a NERV uniform and a borrowed
labcoat. Brown hair fell into bemused eyes as she
watched the EVA move, standing there slightly apart
from the others.

Maya focused on her job, ignoring their guest for now
as the black haired young woman crisply asked Rei,
&quot;How does it feel, Rei?&quot;

Rei&#39;s red eyed gaze was calm as she looked out at
them, &quot;So far everything feels fine.&quot;

Misato sat on a higher lever, Ritsuko at her side as
they watched the latest in a series of reactivation
tests for Unit-00. &quot;So what else did Prof. Fuyutsuki
say?&quot; Misato asked, the red jacket she wore suiting
her black hair.

&quot;If Shinji is operating under a delusion,&quot; Ritsuko
said wryly, &quot;it&#39;s a remarkably consistent one.&quot; She
pushed blonde hair back from her face, &quot;According to
the Professor, Yui Ikari knows all the details of her
school years, along with information that Shinji would
have a very hard time getting.&quot;

Misato had her hands folded under her chin in a very
familiar looking gesture as she murmured,
&quot;Remarkable.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Ritsuko agreed.

Yui had moved forward slightly, studying the controls
in front of Maya curiously. There was a look of exited
interest on that normally impassive face, eyes
twinkling, and softly talking to Maya. The smile was
probably the oddest thing, a warm, gentle look that
seemed entirely different from the sort of expressions
Shinji would have.

&quot;I&#39;m still surprised that Yui couldn&#39;t even move the
Unit-02,&quot; Misato said thoughtfully, &quot;since Shinji had
used it before.&quot;

&quot;The synch rates were completely different,&quot; Ritsuko
sighed softly, &quot;I can almost believe that there really
is someone different inside that head.&quot;

&quot;And what do the Magi say?&quot; Misato questioned.

&quot;It&#39;s possible for the body switch to have happened,&quot;
Ritsuko answered, &quot;but Mom calculates the odds as
extremely remote.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot; Misato raised her eyebrows and Ritsuko blushed.

Standing not far away Asuka watched, a slight frown on
her face. &#39;Guess she&#39;s still a little concerned for
Rei,&#39; Misato mused, &#39;she hasn&#39;t been in her EVA for
awhile.&#39; Once Rei completed her practice run she
backed into the cage, the entry plug sliding free to
release the young woman.

Asuka reached out, helping the still damp Rei step out
onto the catwalk. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she squeezed Asuka&#39;s
hand warmly, a gentle smile on her face.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Asuka blushed faintly as they began
walking.

&quot;It feels different than being in the simulators,&quot; Rei
noted softly once they reached the lift, &quot;not actually
bad, but... different.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Asuka agreed, pointedly not
mentioning the occasional panic attacks she still had
inside her own EVA. Thankfully continuing to pilot
Unit-02 seemed to help, the frequency of attacks
slowly decreasing.

&quot;So what do you think of Ikari-san?&quot; Rei asked once
they emerged from the elevator and went out into a
hallway.

&quot;Odd,&quot; Asuka made a face, &quot;I keep expecting to hear
her say something more Shinji-like and then she
doesn&#39;t. Not to mention how smart she seems to be.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Rei admitted.

Maya smiled as Rei and Asuka entered, Misato, Ritsuko
and Yui standing nearby. &quot;Both of your synch ratios
are steadily improving,&quot; she revealed, &quot;good work.&quot;

&quot;I think Rei is ready for field work again,&quot; Misato
agreed, &quot;it&#39;s nice to know if there&#39;s an emergency we
have two pilots.&quot;

Yui had the oddest look on her face, her black hair
falling to the base of her neck. &quot;I thought that the
Angels had been defeated,&quot; she frowned.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; Ritsuko said wryly.
Choosing to keep things as general as possible she
said, &quot;The United Nations has designated NERV to be
the first line of defense against a possible alien
invasion.&quot;

&quot;And boy were we thrilled to hear that,&quot; Asuka said
impishly, just ignoring the scolding look that Rei
gave her.

&quot;I was wondering if I could speak to you privately?&quot;
Yui asked Misato quietly.

With a nod the two of them left, the much taller
Misato leading Yui out. &quot;I don&#39;t envy Misato having to
deal with her,&quot; Maya softly said what everyone was
thinking.

Misato looked at Yui as they walked to a small meeting
room, one set aside for conferences relating to NERV
activities. A woman in a young man&#39;s body, the
personality boldly changing expression and stance into
something almost entirely different. Waving Yui to a
seat she took the seat at the head of the table, a
unconscious position of authority. &quot;How can I help
you?&quot; Misato asked crisply, looking into those oddly
familiar eyes.

Yui ran a hand through black hair, her expression
tired. &quot;From what Ritsuko and I can tell my condition
isn&#39;t going to be easily curable,&quot; she said, &quot;so while
we&#39;re working on it I&#39;d like to offer my assistance to
NERV.&quot;

Misato smiled wryly, &quot;And normally I&#39;d leap at the
offer.&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Yui raised an eyebrow in a very un-Shinji like
gesture.

&quot;I have to be certain of your mental state before I
can bring you into NERV,&quot; Misato said frankly, &quot;or
show you confidential materials.&quot;

&quot;You still think I&#39;m operating under a delusion,&quot; Yui
looked angry, &quot;despite what Prof. Fuyutsuki has
said...&quot;

Misato held up a hand to stop her, &quot;I hold Prof.
Fuyutsuki in the highest regard, but he is not a
psychologist.&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;There&#39;s an
outside expert we&#39;ve called on before, one who has the
needed clearance to interview you. Once she checks you
out, you&#39;ll be free to go to work.&quot;

Yui didn&#39;t look very happy with the idea, but she
nodded before asking, &quot;So who is this expert I&#39;ll be
seeing.&quot;

&quot;Ami Mizuno,&quot; Misato said, &quot;she&#39;ll be here tomorrow to
interview you.&quot;

&quot;That was fast,&quot; Yui blinked, &quot;I&#39;ve been awake less
than a day.&quot;

&quot;Once I sketched in the situation she was eager to see
you: Misato answered. She added, &quot;She interviewed Rei
and talked to Asuka, both of whom only say good things
about her.&quot;

&quot;Asuka, yes,&quot; Yui looked oddly guilty as she asked,
&quot;Those scars she has, the eyepatch, those came from
piloting the EVA?&quot;

Misato felt a moment of vertigo, realizing that in a
way she was sitting in front of one of the original
creators of Evangelion, one who apparently felt
responsible for how it was used, She debated lying to
her but Misato decided against it, &quot;Yes, injuries that
she suffered which were compounded by feedback through
the EVA.&quot;

Yui winced visibly as she confessed, &quot;I never thought
that would happen.&quot;

&quot;Once you&#39;re cleared for work we could use your help
with the problem,&quot; Misato said, &quot;of developing a
shield to protect a pilot from similar effects.&quot;
Mentally she added, &#39;Not to mention helping with the
Archangel.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;d be honored to help,&quot; Yui said firmly. She
hesitated a moment, &quot;I&#39;m not comfortable staying in
the hospital, is it possible I could have a suite
assigned/&quot;

Misato really wasn&#39;t sure this was a good idea but she
forged on, &quot;Actually, I have a spare bedroom at my
place you could use.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;It used to be
Shinji&#39;s, however.&quot;

Yui thought about that a moment. &quot;If you wouldn&#39;t
mind?&quot;

Misato shrugged, &quot;You&#39;re welcome to join the crowd.&quot;

&quot;Crowd?&quot; Yui looked confused.

&#39;She really doesn&#39;t seem to know anything Shinji
would,&#39; Misato thought. &quot;My other spare room has Rei
and Asuka in it,&quot; she said, &quot;oh, and there&#39;s a
penguin.&quot;

&quot;Your home sounds like a very interesting place,&quot; Yui
said diplomatically.

Misato just laughed, &quot;Wait until you meet the
neighbors.&quot;
