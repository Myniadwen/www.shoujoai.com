<h1>No Words (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>

<a href="../eva/nowords-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Rei was still sitting in the locker room, still naked, heart still 
beating furiously. Her wet hair ruffled, her skin a little less pale 
than usual. Confusion could be seen in her face, if one knew what 
signs to look for. Her white hands were cupped in front of her, 
holding something. She could still not make heads or tails of the 
recent events. Her life was not as simple as it had been two hours 
ago.

For the first time in her young life, someone had shown her real, 
physical attention. Someone had touched her, not just by accident, but 
willingly. Someone...

A sudden presence in the shower with her. Two hands on her body. A 
glimpse of red hair. A warm breath against her neck. 

At that instant, her mind had frozen up. Rei was used to think before 
reacting, and this was too sudden, too unexpected. She had found 
herself unable to respond to this strange situation. Her breath had 
caught in her throat, her entire body had tensed up. She had wanted to 
speak, but couldn&#39;t form any words.

And then Souryu&#39;s hands had started to move, and all that tension had 
suddenly found a focus.

Rei had no idea of what had happened. Well, of course she did know 
what had been done. She might be introvert, but she wasn&#39;t ignorant. 
She knew what Souryu had done to her. She knew how she had reacted. 
Only...she had no idea what it meant. 

Souryu hadn&#39;t said a single word. Maybe if she had, Rei&#39;s mind could 
have snapped back into action. Regained control of her body. Maybe...

Fingers tracing over her skin. A storm of unfamiliar emotions 
assaulting her mind, drowning out any conscious thought. 

...maybe words wouldn&#39;t have mattered. These emotions had been strong, 
so very strong. Emotions she had never felt before. Emotions, 
something she normally wouldn&#39;t be bothered with. Now she couldn&#39;t 
chase them out of her head.

Rei looked down at her hands. Pale, almost white, with nails cut 
short. Up until now, nothing but a convenient pair of tools. Held 
between them was a single strand of silken red hair. 

A gasp, a shudder. An overwhelming sensation rushing through her. 

The sight of the red hair made her breath tremble and her pulse 
quicken. A strange, tingling feeling in her chest grew a little 
stronger. This feeling had been with her since Souryu left. She felt 
excited and nervous at the same time. There was a yearning somewhere 
inside her. A yearning for...for...

...emotions. 

She blinked twice. For the first time in her life, she felt like she 
needed to think with her heart. And her heart was confused. 

Staring off into a place only she could see, Rei pressed the strand of 
hair against her chest.

Monday, after lunch. Asuka was sitting at her desk, staring at the 
flat, green surface. Hikari was next to her, talking about something, 
but Asuka didn&#39;t really pay attention. It had been the strangest 
weekend of her life. Her mind had been someplace else completely, 
replaying over and over again what had happened. She had even dreamt 
about it. That had been...unnerving.

She had woken up, soaking with sweat and hearing Ayanami&#39;s hurried 
breath in her ears. Then, still groggy and confused, she had grabbed 
the phone with the intent to call Ayanami. Now, afterwards, she had no 
idea what she would have said. Somehow realizing she didn&#39;t know the 
number, she had instead dialled up Hikari and would probably have 
confessed all of it to her, if it hadn&#39;t been her father answering the 
phone and demanding to know what the hell she wanted in the middle of 
the night.

Now she was back in the same classroom as Ayanami, and the albino&#39;s 
presence was like a red-hot needle in her mind. Impossible to ignore. 
And later, after the synch test, they were going to be back in the 
locker room...

Asuka found herself staring at Ayanami, who was in turn staring out 
the windows. Quickly, she jerked her head around and focused once more 
on the top of her desk. This unconscious staring had happened several 
times already. Embarrassing, considering Ayanami was sitting two rows 
behind and to the left of Asuka. 

Asuka felt she wasn&#39;t in control of herself, and it was driving her 
nuts. She had to remain calm. There would be no more staring. Nothing 
had happened. Things were normal. Ayanami was just... She just...

She just might look back. 

Again, Asuka&#39;s eyes involuntarily sought out Ayanami. And found a pair 
of red eyes staring back. 

The rest of the world disappeared. 

That look again, looking at her like she was the only living creature 
in the world. Focusing on her, and her alone. Attention. Complete 
attention.

I need that. 

An eternity passed. Slowly, the world made its way back. Hikari was 
asking her something.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I said, are you alright?&quot; Her friend was watching her with a 
concerned look. &quot;You&#39;ve been zoning out a lot today.&quot;

Chasing strange images from her mind, Asuka pulled a hand through her 
hair and feigned a cool smile.

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

A minute later she glanced back, but Ayanami was once again staring 
out through the windows. 

--- 

Wednesday morning. Not a word had passed between Asuka and Ayanami 
since the previous Thursday. Nothing had happened between them since 
that shared look on Monday. And Asuka was starting to feel like she 
was on the verge of a breakdown. She couldn&#39;t concentrate. She was 
jumpy and irritable. And she was nervous. The wrong kind of nervous. 
Nervous like she was waiting for something to happen. Only it didn&#39;t. 

This inner confusion was hard to hide. Hikari was starting to suspect 
something, and Misato had already noticed. She had seriously asked 
Asuka if she was doing any drugs. Though it didn&#39;t take much to 
convince her otherwise, (after all, anything out of the ordinary was 
bound to show up on all the tests the Children underwent) it was still 
weird to have her ask. Asuka needed to get a grip on herself. It was 
scary to have her guardian think she might be a junkie. Asuka, who 
hadn&#39;t even smoked a cigarette in her entire life. 

I just can&#39;t stop thinking of Ayanami&#39;s eyes. 

She had found herself fantasizing about jumping Ayanami in the 
corridor, in front of everyone. The thought had been hard to let go. 

Now they were having biology, and Asuka was doing her best to stay 
focused on the task at hand, namely putting drops of liquid from 
various vials onto small glass discs. It had something to do with 
bacteria. It was probably terribly interesting. She took a vial, 
unscrewed the cork, carefully withdrew some of its contents with a 
pipette and with equal care placed a drop from it on the tiny 
rectangle of glass on her desk. Then she put a small square of plastic 
on top of the drop, pressed gently, and put the prepared sample to the 
side. Then she repeated the entire procedure. It was comfortably 
mind-numbing.

Suddenly she felt Hikari&#39;s elbow nudging her in the side, and realized 
that the entire classroom was silent. Looking up, she saw the teacher 
watching her intently.

&quot;What?&quot; she snapped.

&quot;I was saying,&quot; the man said, probably repeating himself for the third 
time, &quot;that we need microscopes. They are placed in two white boxes in 
the basement, and I want a volunteer to go and get them for me. You 
have just volunteered, miss Souryu.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Asuka exclaimed once more. This was not what she needed right 
now. &quot;Why me?!&quot;

&quot;It was decided on the democratic principle that you were the only one 
still staring at the table after I called for the class&#39;s attention. 
Now, please?&quot; He held out a key towards Asuka.

Sensing more objections would not help her case, she glanced around 
the classroom. Everyone was looking at her. Ayanami too. Asuka&#39;s eyes 
lingered just a moment longer than appropriate before she snatched the 
offered key and stormed out of the room.

A few seconds later, the albino rose from her seat, said something 
about helping, and left. The teacher, being as surprised as his 
students, made no objections.

--- 

The basement was the school&#39;s storage. Anything that couldn&#39;t be put 
to an immediate use ended up down there. It was therefore crammed with 
all sorts of stuff, from old desks to last year&#39;s Christmas 
decorations. An ancient light bulb spread a yellowish glow from the 
far end of the room.

Souryu was shuffling things around in an angered manner when Rei came 
down the stairs. The white boxes were placed at the bottom of a large 
pile of other, heavy-looking boxes. The Second Child was not being 
gentle in relocating them.

For a moment Rei stood in the doorway, watching the back of the fiery 
girl as she aggressively dug her way through the boxes. She had no 
idea what she was doing down here, only a vague notion that she had to 
talk to Souryu about...about Friday night.

Rei took a few steps forward. The red-head was so concentrated on her 
work that she obviously didn&#39;t hear her approaching. Gathering up her 
courage, the pale girl reached out and put a hand on Souryu&#39;s arm.

The other girl froze up. Her hand hovered an inch above one of the 
boxes, trembling slightly. She was glancing down at the white hand 
resting on her arm. A few, tense seconds passed. Then, she grabbed 
Rei&#39;s hand and spun around, staring at the albino. Rei gasped and took 
a step back, completely at loss to the rage of emotions she saw in 
those blue eyes. For a panicked second she thought Souryu was going to 
hurt her.

Then their lips connected, and Souryu brought them both to the floor.

It took them half an hour to find those microscopes.
