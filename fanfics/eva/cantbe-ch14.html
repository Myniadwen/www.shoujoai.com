<h1>If I Can't Be Yours (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rocketbabe.html">RocketBabe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Neither woman really had a sense of how long they stood there for, 
staring at each other, caught in a stalemate, both at first afraid to 
make a move, before Ritsuko eventually took a cautious step towards the 
brunette.

&quot;Maya.&quot; Having heard her name, the younger woman rushed forwards, 
quickstepping the rest of the distance between them. Tears were already 
falling down her face as she flung her arms around Ritsuko, who 
instinctively began to place fleeting pecks on Maya&#39;s cheeks, before 
drawing her into a long, deep kiss that was gladly reciprocated. 
Whatever reaction each of them had been expecting from the other, it had 
not been anything like this. All of the worries and the stress the two 
women had had over their feelings over the past few days, weeks, even 
months seemed to dissolve in that embrace. Maya gripped Ritsuko tightly, 
not wanting any space to come between them, afraid that letting her go 
may destroy the moment, may wake her up from this most beautiful of 
dreams, alone once again. They eventually broke their kiss and looked 
deep into each other&#39;s eyes. Ritsuko saw Maya&#39;s tears and tenderly 
brushed them away with her thumb, kissing Maya&#39;s cheeks in their wake.

&quot;Oh.oh.&quot; Maya&#39;s voice came in choked sobs of pure joy. &quot;Ritsuko.I love 
you so, so much.&quot; Ritsuko nuzzled at Maya&#39;s neck gently and allowed her 
hands to caress the exposed skin of Maya&#39;s back. The younger woman 
whimpered and felt her legs begin to weaken at the touch of Ritsuko&#39;s 
hands against her skin, as she placed her own arms over the blonde&#39;s 
shoulders. This moment was so much greater than either of them had ever 
dared to dream it might have been, the suppressed longing each had 
harboured for the other only deepening the intensity of sensation caused 
by every breath, every kiss and every caress. Both women were now 
completely aware and objectionable to the restriction imposed upon them 
by their clothing. Almost without thinking, Maya slid the straps of 
Ritsuko&#39;s dress off her shoulders and the garment dropped to the floor. 
Ritsuko slid her hands behind Maya&#39;s neck to untie the halter fastening. 
Leaning in close to Maya&#39;s ear she whispered.

&quot;Are you as sure as me that you want this to happen?&quot; Maya nodded and 
replied, sounding almost in pain.

&quot;I&#39;ve not been this sure of anything in a long, long time, please don&#39;t 
stop, no matter what, promise me you won&#39;t stop.&quot; Maya swallowed hard. 
&quot;I need you.&quot; Ritsuko found the hook and eye fastenings on the back of 
Maya&#39;s top, her skilled fingers quickly unhooking them as she explored 
Maya&#39;s neck with her tongue, before moving her lips back to Maya&#39;s ear.

&quot;I love you.&quot; The lilac material fell to the floor, leaving Maya naked 
from the waist up. Ritsuko unfastened her own bra and discarded it, 
drawing Maya once again into her arms. She moaned softly as Maya&#39;s 
breasts came into contact with her own, a feeling that drove her to new 
heights of arousal. She had been missing this level of desire for 
somebody, physically and emotionally, someone who wanted her in return, 
for too long and she couldn&#39;t help but give in to it. Keeping as close 
as they possibly could, with maximum contact, the two women quickly 
moved into Ritsuko&#39;s bedroom, not bothering to close the door behind 
them.

The early evening sunshine filtered in through the linen curtains, 
bathing the room in a warm, hazy light. There was no noise in the 
apartment, aside from the deep, rhythmic breathing of the lovers, 
creating an atmosphere of total peace. Even the traffic noise from 
outside seemed distant lending an idyllic, dream-like feeling to the 
room. Maya looked little short of angelic as she lay, her head on 
Ritsuko&#39;s chest, one arm draped over her torso. She appeared to be 
sleeping, even though it was just 4pm. Still, the activity that had gone 
before had been physically exhausting for both of them, though at the 
same time it had healed and restored them to some extent emotionally. 
The blonde sighed contentedly and whispered, barely audibly &quot;Thankyou.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Maya&#39;s eyes opened and she looked up at Ritsuko with a 
smile.

&quot;Now that&#39;s a dirty trick, pretending to be asleep.&quot; Maya giggled as 
Ritsuko kissed the top of her head.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She feigned a pout. &quot;Would you like to punish me?&quot; It was 
Ritsuko&#39;s turn to laugh.

&quot;Only if you&#39;re lucky.&quot; She yawned and stretched languidly. Maya seized 
the opportunity to snuggle closer still to Ritsuko, pretending to 
shiver. &quot;Surely you can&#39;t be cold? It&#39;s over ninety degrees outside.&quot; 
Maya replied in tones of fake indignance.

&quot;Air conditioning sempai, brrr!&quot; Ritsuko chuckled softly, but was 
drowned out by the growling of Maya&#39;s stomach.

&quot;Hungry?&quot;

&quot;Hmmmm yes.&quot;

&quot;Feel like cooking?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;Me either.&quot; She paused for a few seconds, mulling over their options. 
Much as she didn&#39;t feel like cooking, she wasn&#39;t sure she could motivate 
herself to actually leave the house in search of food. Besides, leaving 
the house would return them to the real world, a world full of people 
and worry and unpleasantness and she wasn&#39;t quite ready to leave their 
blissful time together as a couple. &quot;We could order something up.&quot;

&quot;Would I have to get dressed?&quot; Ritsuko considered this for a moment.

&quot;No, you could just stay there and be lazy.&quot;

&quot;Very funny.&quot; Maya yawned. &quot;Wait a second.would YOU have to get 
dressed?&quot;

&quot;Well one of us will have to open the door to the delivery person.&quot;

&quot;Aww.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll get up.&quot; Maya lethargically pulled 
herself out of bed, not bothering to cover up her nudity as she went to 
the guest room. Ritsuko reached over to her bedside table and picked up 
the telephone.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Their impromptu dinner of a large Hawaiian pizza arrived whilst Ritsuko 
was showering so Maya, freshly bathed and dressed in short denim cutoffs 
and a plain yellow T-shirt, answered the door and paid for the delivery. 
Ritsuko heard the doorbell and cut her shower short, wrapping a large 
towel around her body for the most informal dinner date she had ever 
had. Maya raised an approving eyebrow. &quot;Do you always dress like this 
around your houseguests?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get your hopes up, I&#39;m not usually this much of a slob I&#39;m just 
starving right now.&quot; She knelt down to the table. &quot;If you want a 
permanently indecently dressed hostess you&#39;d do better to move in with 
Misato.&quot; Maya laughed and grabbed a slice, Ritsuko already tucking in. 
&quot;Well, it may be the lazy option but it sure beats anything I could have 
cooked.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t be that bad.&quot; Said Maya, rushing to contradict 
Ritsuko&#39;s self-deprecation, prompting a snicker from the elder woman.

&quot;Oh you have a lot to learn about living with me Maya. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m 
not domesticated in the slightest.&quot; She reached for another slice of 
pizza. &quot;But I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be able to get by together.&quot; Maya smiled.

&quot;Yes, Ritsuko.&quot;</pre>
