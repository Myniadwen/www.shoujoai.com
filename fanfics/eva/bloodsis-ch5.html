<h1>Blood Sisters (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/bloodsis-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Misato saw Ritsuko looking over at her, and she had to fight 
down her nervousness to continue just longing there, looking so 
comfortable. Ritsuko frowned at her slightly, &quot;Didn&#39;t you say you wanted 
to talk to me later?&quot;

        Misato took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. She checked 
to see if the pilots were still gone before saying, &quot;I guess this is 
private enough.&quot;

        &#39;Private?&#39; Ritsuko looked over at her in surprise, &#39;Why do we 
need to be private?&#39;

        &quot;For this,&quot; Misato leaned over a little before gently pressing 
her lips to the startled Ritsuko&#39;s. After a moment of stunned shock 
Ritsuko leaned into the kiss, clearly enjoying the gentle kiss. Misato 
let the tip of her tongue slip past Ritsuko&#39;s parted lips, and with a 
shudder the other woman let it in. A few seconds later they slid apart, 
their breaths coming faster.

        &quot;Are you.. I mean, why..&quot; Ritsuko stammered out, the blonde 
looking so very beautiful there in the moonlight.

        Misato met her eyes, trying to put all of her sincerity into her 
next few words. &quot;I&#39;m not drunk, and this isn&#39;t just an sudden impulse,&quot; 
she said to her gravely. A slight smile and Misato felt a deep pain as 
she continued on, &quot;If you really don&#39;t want this, just tell me and we&#39;ll 
both try to forget that any of this ever happened.&quot;

        Ritsuko reached out to gently cup Misato&#39;s face, and Misato felt 
herself shudder under that touch. &quot;I don&#39;t think I could forget a kiss 
like that,&quot; Ritsuko said softly.

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Misato smiled devilishly. She slid a bit closer in 
the warm water, her hands reaching out to gently stroke along Ritsuko&#39;s 
legs, savoring the feeling of the silken flesh. Her hands slid up to the 
thighs, and she looked up to meet Ritsuko&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Ritsuko gasped out softly at that touch, the blonde&#39;s 
cheeks glowing bright red in the near darkness. She looked up at Misato 
and smiled at her weakly, &quot;Do you think we should maybe go somewhere 
more private?&quot;

        Misato got out of the water, her towel still firmly wrapped 
around her as she gently tugged, pulling Ritsuko up to her feet. &quot;Let&#39;s 
go,&quot; she said quietly.

        Together they went into the changing room, grabbing at their 
clothes and moving on, still just garbed in their simple towels. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad you&#39;re not getting dressed,&quot; Ritsuko looked over and smiled 
happily, &quot;you look good in just that.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato agreed, squeezing the hand that had been 
slipped into her own. They padded down the hall barefoot, sliding the 
screen door open for their room. Ritsuko went in first, then Misato slid 
the door shut behind her.

        Ritsuko walked over to the two futons, then stopped. She looked 
up, and Misato saw fear and worry in those eyes as she asked, &quot;Are you 
sure?&quot;

        Misato walked over there, reaching out to gently take the 
blonde&#39;s hands in her own. She brought Ritsuko&#39;s hands up to her mouth, 
gently kissing the backs, her hair blowing around her face from the 
slight breeze.

        &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that since university,&quot; Misato admitted, then 
with a little smile she added, &quot;And much more, too.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Ritsuko admitted, and she stepped forward to kiss 
Misato once again.

        This time Ritsuko was a bit more daring, letting her passion 
free, and Misato welcomed it gladly. Their bodies pressed together, the 
kiss deepening as Ritsuko&#39;s hand slid down her back. The ties holding 
the towel up untied easily, and it fell with a wet thump to the floor.

        &quot;Let me look at you,&quot; Ritsuko said softly.

        Misato felt suddenly nervous as her old friend stepped back, 
looking her over frankly. She was suddenly reminded of the pounds she 
needed to loose, the one breast that was a bit larger than the other, 
when she had last shaved her legs, or trimmed somewhere else..

        &quot;What are you smiling at?&quot; Misato finally had to ask.

        &quot;You&#39;re so lovely,&quot; Ritsuko said to her simply, her husky voice 
and eyes clearly showing the depths of her desire.

        Misato felt her cheeks color, but she smiled. &quot;Good,&quot; she 
stepped up to Ritsuko, putting her hands on the towel, &quot;It&#39;s your turn 
to show all.&quot;

        Ritsuko gasped softly as Misato let her head rest on her 
shoulder, her warm breath blowing across her neck. Misato slipped her 
hands across the top of the towel where the ties were, then she let them 
slide down. The ribs and sides were lovingly stroked, then the hands 
reached down to cup the round orbs of the ass.

        &quot;Just getting to know the territory,&quot; Misato said wickedly.

        &quot;Remember this,&quot; Ritsuko gasped out, &quot;I&#39;m going to have you on 
your back, bare naked and completely defenseless.&quot;

        Misato chuckled softly, &quot;Of course.&quot; She slid her hands back up 
to the ties, untying the strands and letting the towel fall to the 
floor.

        &quot;Going to take a look?&quot; Ritsuko asked, letting Misato step back 
a bit. She tilted her head to the side, &quot;I believe you do know I&#39;m not a 
natural blonde.&quot;

        Misato didn&#39;t answer that, letting her eyes openly take in the 
beautiful body standing before her, instead of the furtive glances she 
had taken before. Even in university she hadn&#39;t had such a chance, and 
she savored it. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Misato smiled.

        &quot;Come here,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s voice had dropped to a throaty purr.

        Misato took that outstretched hand, both of them sliding down 
onto the two futons. The blankets were already rumpled, both of their 
bodies laying there side by side. They kissed again, Misato letting her 
fingers tangle in that soft blonde hair, then they separated 
reluctantly.

        &quot;I should let you know,&quot; Misato felt herself blushing slightly 
as she continued, &quot;that I&#39;ve never actually done this before.&quot; A soft, 
warm laugh, &quot;Thought about it a few times, especially with you, but not 
actually done it.&quot;

        Ritsuko chuckled softly. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; she admitted, 
reaching out to gently trace a finger down Misato&#39;s neck towards her 
shoulders, &quot;but I feel it all coming back to me.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m so glad,&quot; Misato murmured.

        With a sudden move Ritsuko rolled them over, putting Misato on 
her back. The blonde smiled down at her, &quot;Got you now.&quot;

        Misato shivered as Ritsuko kissed her throat, then down to the 
curve of her shoulders. She gasped, nipples teased by so expert fingers. 
A wet. raspy tongue stroked along her flesh, tracing those round orbs 
before settling on the nipples to suck gently.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Misato shuddered as the teeth teased a hard nipple.

        &quot;Glad to see that I haven&#39;t lost my touch,&quot; Ritsuko murmured, 
leaving the breasts to slide down even farther.

        Misato squealed, giggling as hands slid along ticklish ribs, a 
gentle kiss landing on the curve of her belly. &quot;I&#39;d say you&#39;re gifted,&quot; 
Misato managed breathlessly.

        &quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet,&quot; Ritsuko smiled wickedly before 
moving down to that dark triangle, soon taking away all of Misato&#39;s 
ability to have rational thought...

        ... it was hours later, the sun rising when they lay there, 
tangled and sweaty on the sheets. &quot;That was incredible,&quot; Misato sighed 
softly. She smiled, reaching out to push blonde hair out of Ritsuko&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t disappoint you.&quot;

        &quot;You were inspired,&quot; Ritsuko chuckled softly.

        Misato felt herself blushing, looking away. She had been an 
eager and dedicated student, practicing all that she had learned through 
the night. They lay there in the silence, Ritsuko reaching over to 
gently run her fingers through her hair, her expression oddly 
contemplative. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Misato asked softly, looking into 
Ritsuko&#39;s eyes.

        Ritsuko smiled at her sadly. &quot;This.. this can&#39;t continue, can 
it?&quot; she asked her softly. Misato was about to speak up when she 
continued on, &quot;I have my obligations, and you know that the pilots all 
depend on you.&quot;

        Misato rolled over on her back, sighing softly. &quot;I guess not,&quot; 
she finally admitted softly, &quot;but I won&#39;t forget about this night, 
either.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Ritsuko agreed. They slipped into another kiss, then 
noises out from the hallway disturbed them. &quot;Guess the pilots are up,&quot; 
she added.

        &quot;We&#39;d better make sure that Asuka and Rei didn&#39;t kill Shinji,&quot; 
Misato sighed, getting to her feet. She grabbed a robe, pulling it on 
tiredly. &quot;Coming?&quot;

        &quot;Always,&quot; Ritsuko rose to follow her with a smile.

The End.

Epilogue

        General Misato Katsuragi watched Maya and Ritsuko leaving from 
the window, a slight smile on her face. It had been nearly a year ago, 
but the memory still stirred something within her. She and Ritsuko 
hadn&#39;t talked about it when they went back to NERV, and when things got 
bad and crazy she had lost sight of that.. tenderness.

        Thankfully, they had all been given a second chance at 
happiness. She looked back into the room, smiling fondly as Rei and 
Asuka talked softly, sharing some of the celebratory cake. Maya had been 
promoted just today, and if her less that subtle hints to Ritsuko did 
the job, the two might be getting together later tonight.

        &#39;You deserve to be happy, Rits-chan,&#39; Misato thought to her old 
friend, &#39;and I know that Maya does that for you.&#39;

        &quot;Misato,&quot; Asuka called out to her, &quot;come have some more cake!&quot;

        &quot;Right, right,&quot; Misato walked over to their side, feeling warm 
at the friendship in both Asuka and Rei&#39;s eyes. &#39;I made a lot of 
mistakes,&#39; she mused, &#39;but at least this is good.&#39;

        &quot;Misato?&quot; Rei looked up at her curiously with those innocent 
reddish eyes.

        Misato smiled, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;Have you ever had a girlfriend, like Ritsuko and Maya?&quot; Rei 
asked innocently.

        Misato blinked down at her, and before Asuka could scold the 
girl she smiled. &quot;Once, yes,&quot; Misato smiled, &quot;maybe one day I&#39;ll tell 
you about it...&quot;

Authors Notes: For those who don&#39;t read my other series, this is a tie 
in with my fic Evangelion: Third Genesis, and the party that Misato is 
attending is around Part Twelve of that fic. The idea for this story 
came from a challenge to do a romance for Misato and Ritsuko, hopefully 
believably. I&#39;m not quite sure if this pulls it off, but I tried. My 
knowledge of EVA is still pretty limited, from seeing a few episodes, 
reading mangas, and watching the two EVA movies, so if I got something 
BADLY wrong, let me know. Review, please! I may also do a more... 
explicit version for www.adultfanfiction.net if I get enough requests.</pre>
