<h1>A Very Friendly Welcum</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lulu312.html">Lulu312</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	It had been a boring day. An Angel had not attacked in ages and 
Asuka was getting tired of waiting. Asuka did many unusal things when she 
was bored. She went down to Nerv just to make sure the employees were 
doing their jobs right. Then she went back to Misato&#39;s house and played
with Pen Pen. 
	&quot;Jeeze, what hell is going on? Where the hell are those Angels? I 
wanna kick sum ass already.&quot; Asuka said outloud. Shinji was eating at
the table.
	&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not coming. We can use this time to brush up 
on our skills or study for school.&quot; Shinji smiled. 
	&quot;You&#39;re such an ass. Study? What the hell. I graduated out of 
college you idiot. And you don&#39;t wanna fight the Angels &#39;cause you suck 
and you know that.&quot; Asuka roared. 
	&quot;Why do I bother?&quot; Shinji mumbled, got up and went to the kitchen.
	&quot;Because you&#39;re an idiot.&quot; Asuka laughed even though Shinji had 
already left. Asuka went to Misato&#39;s Adress book and skimmed through the
numbers.
	&quot;OOO KAJI!! I totally forgot about him. He never calls back though. 
Bastard.&quot; Asuka thought as she glanced at Kaji&#39;s number. She scanned
the other numbers and finally landed on Ayanami Rei&#39;s number.
	&quot;Wonder girl needs some friends. She&#39;s kinda creepy though. But she 
is the First Child so I should befriend her creepy ass. Well, there&#39;s
nothing else to do. I might as well call her over.&quot; Asuka dialed Rei&#39;s 
number.
	&quot;Hello?&quot; Rei picked up the phone immediately. This startled Asuka.
	&quot;The hell? Were you waiting for the phone to ring?&quot;
	&quot;....&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s Asuka. Don&#39;t you recognize my voice?&quot;
	&quot;Asuka. Unit 002. Gendo Ikari told me he&#39;d call if he had time.&quot;
	&quot;Okaaaay. Do you two got sumthing goin on?&quot; Asuka asked.
	&quot;I do not believe so.&quot;
	&quot;Weirdo.&quot; Asuka whispered.
	&quot;...&quot;
	&quot;Um...erm...do you wanna come over? There&#39;s nothing to do.&quot;
	&quot;What? Why?&quot;
	&quot;Jeeze do I hafta write you a book? That&#39;s what people do. They 
socialize and hang out.&quot;
	&quot;Hang out?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah.....&quot; Asuka smacked her head in fustration. Was Wonder girl 
slow or what? 
	&quot;Well, I want to stay here and wait for Mr. Ikari&#39;s call.&quot;
	&quot;Oh my god. You can&#39;t just stay there all day!&quot;
	&quot;Why not?&quot;
	&quot;Um...&#39;cause that&#39;s not human!!&quot; Asuka shouted. 
	&quot;....&quot; Rei was silent. 	
	&quot;Rei?&quot; Asuka called out for Rei. Oh shit! Did I offend her? Jeeze, 
talk about sensitve. I&#39;ve never been one to say sorry but there&#39;s a first 
for everything.
	&quot;Rei? I&#39;m sorry, ok?&quot;
	&quot;....&quot;
	&quot;Oh c&#39;mon Wonder girl. I&#39;m just kidding around.&quot;
	&quot;No, no. It&#39;s not that. I&#39;m ok. Was that supposed to hurt?&quot;
	&quot;What? Well, not really. I&#39;m always dissing people, ya know?&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t feel anything.&quot;
	&quot;Then why were you silent?&quot;
	&quot;&#39;Cause...sometimes I think I&#39;m not human.&quot;
	&quot;Oh my god. Of course you&#39;re human. You&#39;re just one of those loner 
types.&quot; Oh god, is this chick a nut case or what?
	&quot;....&quot;
	&quot;Well, ok. If you&#39;re going to stay there waiting for you&#39;re 
boyfriend to call you go ahead. But I&#39;m coming over to keep you company.&quot;
	&quot;What? Why?&quot;
	&quot;Do I need a reason? Fine, I&#39;m bored as hell. I&#39;m coming over.&quot; 
Asuka hanged up the phone. She went into her room and looked for clothes. 
	&quot;Jeeze, its never enough is it?&quot; Asuka thought to herself as she 
explored her closet. No matter how much clothes she had, she always 
wanted more. She was never satisfied. That&#39;s what being human is all 
about anyway. The hunger of always wanting more. All humans had it. Some 
had it more than others. Greed? No it wasn&#39;t greed. It was just a human 
thing. 
	Asuka put on a mint green dress and wore a mint green flower in her 
hair. The dress was a holster dress. It was very fitted and brought out 
all
her curves. Asuka was dressing as if she was going to see Kaji. 
	&quot;I&#39;m going somewhere. Might as well look great. There might be some 
cute boys around. You never know.&quot; Asuka thought. Who was she kidding?
There were no cute boys in Tokyo-3. She&#39;d rather go out with a cute 
girl like Rei. Wait...what? 
	Asuka had seen Rei&#39;s body countless time and each time she saw it 
she wondered what it would like to make love to that perfect body. Asuka
was straight of course. She always thought Rei was atrractive though. 
But whatever. Rei was a girl and Asuka was girl. They just don&#39;t go 
together. Right?
	&quot;Hello Wonder Girl!&quot; Asuka pushed Rei aside and went into her 
aparment when Rei had answered the door.
	&quot;Hi.....&quot; Rei said. 
	&quot;Whoa. This is your crib? Kinda creepy looking huh? No offense.&quot; 
Asuka laughed.
	&quot;...&quot;
	&quot;For crying out loud. Why don&#39;t you do anything? Fight Back!&quot;
	&quot;...&quot;
	&quot;Oh my god.&quot; Asuka smacked her head.
	&quot;What am I supposed to do?&quot;
	&quot;Whatever you feel!!&quot;
	&quot;But I don&#39;t feel....&quot;
	&quot;Oh c&#39;mon! Do I hafta pretend I&#39;m an Angel so you attack me?&quot;	
	&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei asked. 
	&quot;OO, LOOK AT ME I&#39;M ANGEL. WOOO.&quot; Asuka pretended to be an angel. 
She raised her hands and walked around like that. Rei giggled a little
bit.
	&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei questioned her actions.
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;Why did I do that?&quot;
	&quot;&#39;Cause, it&#39;s funny.&quot; Asuka said in a &#39;as a matter of fact way&#39;.
	&quot;Funny?&quot;
	&quot;Yea, people laugh when things are funny.&quot;
	&quot;I see.&quot;	
	&quot;Weirdo.&quot; Asuka winked. 
	&quot;Asuka?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah?&quot;
	&quot;What do you do when you&#39;re angry at someone but you think you love 
them?&quot;
	&quot;Wow, that&#39;s a complicated feeling. Well, let&#39;s see. Well, I like 
Kaji but he&#39;s being a bastard. So right now I&#39;m just waiting for him to 
call me.&quot;
	&quot;Well, I kinda have that feeling for someone.&quot;
	&quot;Who, Gendo?&quot;
	&quot;No...you.&quot; Rei said softly. Asuka&#39;s eyes widened.
	&quot;W-what?&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re very mean to me and Shinji and everyone. But I think I like 
you.&quot;
	&quot;Huh?&quot; Now Asuka was the confused one.
	&quot;I don&#39;t know what this feeling is. I want to touch you.&quot; Rei stared 
into Asuka&#39;s eyes. 
	&quot;B-b-but you&#39;re a girl. And I&#39;m a girl. You&#39;re supposed to like 
boys!&quot; Asuka protested. 
	&quot;I don&#39;t see gender. I just see Asuka.&quot;
	&quot;Huh?&quot; I&#39;ve never thought about it that way. Maybe being attracted 
to the same sex was a human thing too. Nobody ever gave it a chance 
though.
	&quot;But you&#39;re insulting. I try to ignore your remarks. And it did work 
at first. But the more I was with you the more I wanted to touch you.&quot; 
That&#39;s right. Asuka had learnt about this in pshycology. The more your 
with someone, the more you like them. You see pass their flaws. You see 
their true colors and you like them. 
	&quot;Why do you want to touch me?&quot; Asuka walked closer to Rei. They were 
staring each other in the eye. 
	&quot;I just do....&quot; Asuka leaned in to kiss Rei. Both their lips met. 
Rei didn&#39;t know what to do with her hands. Rei was remembering all those 
crude remarks Asuka made and how conceited Asuka was. Rei pushed Asuka 
against a wall and started kissing her neck. Asuka moaned softly. Wow, 
I&#39;ve never known this side of Wonder girl, Asuka thought. Rei kissed 
Asuka&#39;s chest then went lower. Rei got fustrated kissing Asuka&#39;s stomach 
through her dress so she pulled the dress of violently. There was such a 
fire in Rei&#39;s red eyes. Asuka was loving it. Asuka was in her bra and 
panties though Rei was in her school uniform. Asuka wanted that uniform 
off...now! 
	As Rei continued to go lower, Asuka unbuttoned the uniform and tore 
off Rei&#39;s shirt. Now they both were in their bra and panties, against a 
wall. 
Rei lifted Asuka&#39;s legs up and rolled down Asuka&#39;s panties and snapped 
her bra off. Asuka&#39;s eye&#39;s widened. Wow, Wonder girl doesn&#39;t hesistate. 
Asuka 
returned the favor and removed Rei&#39;s bra. 
	&quot;Ugh, uh uh.&quot; Asuka moaned. Rei had entered her finger into Asuka&#39;s 
womanhood. 
	&quot;Does that feel good?&quot; Rei asked.
	&quot;Uh, uh, uh, uh, don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t stop, uhh.&quot; Asuka closed her 
eyes. Her nipples erected. While Rei fingered Asuka, Rei also started 
licking and teasing Asuka&#39;s nipples. Asuka ran her fingers through Rei&#39;s 
short blue hair. Damn, Wonder girl, you&#39;re not only great at fighting 
Angels, you&#39;re a sex machine.  
	&quot;Uhhhhhhh.&quot; Asuka screamed. Rei smiled. She put her tongue into 
Asuka&#39;s mouth. She stopped leaning on Asuka so they could walk to the 
lonely bed. While they walked to the bed, they stayed locked together. 
Then Rei pushed Asuka onto the bed. Asuka&#39;s eyes were still closed. She 
felt something enter her again. It was Rei&#39;s tongue. Rei licked up and 
down on Asuka&#39;s clitoris. 
	&quot;Uhhh, I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m gonna c-cum!&quot; Asuka cummed but Rei licked it 
all up. Asuka petted Rei as Rei did all the work. While Rei licked up the 
mess, she rubbed Asuka&#39;s nipples. Asuka was in Rei Heaven. She never knew 
Rei had it in her and she never thought she&#39;d end up here.
	&quot;Rei....&quot; Asuka panted.
	&quot;Asuka....&quot; Rei said softly.
	&quot;You are great Wonder girl.&quot; Asuka spoke.
	&quot;Thank You.&quot; Rei smiled. 
	&quot;I hope you&#39;re still not mad at me.&quot; They both lay their on that 
tiny bed. Their beautiful bodies together, sweaty from the passionate 
sex. Rei and Asuka looked into each others eyes.
	&quot;No, I&#39;m not mad anymore.&quot;
	Both of them smiled and fell asleep, tired from the unexpected turn 
of events. </pre>
