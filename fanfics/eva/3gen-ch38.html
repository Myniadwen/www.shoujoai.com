<h1>Third Genesis (part 38 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>

<a href="../eva/3gen-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>The battlefield was raging with sounds, weapons
blazing as the armies fought across the desert
wasteland. Tanks exchanged fire as missiles raced back
and forth, men hunkered down in bunkers as they tried
to survive.

&quot;Is it coming?&quot; the commander asked, his sand colored
clothing providing him some cover in the dry, arid
lands.

His second frowned, the black haired man wearing a
white hood to try to screen out the worst of the sun.
&quot;It&#39;s on the move,&quot; he revealed, &quot;but estimated time
of arrival is unknown.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve paid enough for their assistance,&quot; the
commander grumbled as the first shots of another round
whizzed by, &quot;they could at least tell us...&quot;

THOOOM.

Both men jerked to a stop as their eyes widened.
Turning they looked out to the desert, eyes searching
the haze until a figure seemed to emerge from the
haze. It looked human, but only broadly as it&#39;s arms
and legs were eerily distended. It&#39;s face was entirely
covered by a eerie helm, only the red glowing eyes
visible as it strode across the sands, a massive metal
axe at the ready in it&#39;s one hand.

&quot;Is that...?&quot; the lieutenant asked weakly.

&quot;Evangelion,&quot; the older man nodded grimly.

Without a word it advanced, stepping carefully over
their lines as the massive entity advanced on their
enemy. Panic raced through them as they desperately
opened up with everything they had, sending tank
shells, rockets and bullets out only to see them
stopped instantly by the AT field.

The first swipe of the great axe was pure slaughter as
men were reduced to splatter, then the robot moved in
on the machines. Explosions flared and men screamed as
it relentlessly destroyed, tearing apart defenses and
swiftly reducing the enemy force to rubble. It stood
in the wreckage a moment then moved on, lumbering away
out into the sands until it was consumed by the waves
of heat off the sands.

It took some time for the commander to emerge from
under the jeep, gazing across the way at the
devestation before them. &quot;Do you think...,&quot; he gulped,
&quot;there were any survivors?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the younger man managed to get out.
They looked across at the fire and wreckage, &quot;Should
we... send someone to look?&quot;

Another explosion rang out as a tank&#39;s fuel went up,
sending metal flying but otherwise carrying no more
noise. &quot;I really doubt it,&quot; the commander said
bleakly.

The Evangelion unit walked across the sands, lumbering
a bit as it headed northward until it reached a tall
structure. The building looked strange out in the
sands, like someone had plucked a skyscraper and
dropped it down on the desert, but it stood proud and
firm in the sunlight. The Evangelion walked up and the
front of the building folded out, revealing a
compartment that the massive machine stepped into, the
panels covering it as the whole building disappeared
beneath the shifting sands.

The underground facility was barely a shadow of NERV&#39;s
geofront, but it was still respectably sized as the
Evangelion dropped from the surface down a shaft into
the holding bay. Restraints and walkways swung out to
contain it then the entry plug ejected, the silver
tube moving into place by a ramp. Medical teams raced
forward as the hatch popped free helping the brown
haired woman out.

Mana Kirishima climbed out, easily accepting a hand
from one of the young men. The reddish brown haired
girl patiently waited as a doctor checked her over,
then the green plugsuit clad woman hurried down the
walkway to the lockers. Emerging in a simple military
style uniform in black and silver she walked at a more
calm pace to a elevator, the walls of the shaft lined
with rooms filled with busy people.

The office was about halfway up the shaft, a armed
guard waiting outside the door. He nodded respectfully
to her as he pressed a intercom switch, &quot;Ma&#39;am, Lt.
Mana Kirishima is here to see you.&quot;

&quot;Send her in,&quot; the woman replied.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mana nodded to the guard as the door
swished open and she stepped inside. The office was
simply decorated, with only a few photos on the wall,
the floor inscribed with symbols similar to astrology.
The desk was a older type, a bit battered but still
usable, but Mana found her eyes going to the woman
waiting within.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; the similarly uniformed woman said,
her short black hair framing her face, a simple pair
of round sunglasses covering her eyes.

&quot;Commander Rokubungi,&quot; Mana saluted, &quot;the mission went
well.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Nao Rokubungi replied, &quot;I was monitoring
mission telemetry. I&#39;m sorry you had to become
involved in such a trivial matter, but they were
fighting dangerously close to NERV station Alpha.&quot;

&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; Mana nodded, &quot;quite
understandable.&quot;

Nao returned to her seat, placing her hands in front
of her thoughtfully as she mused, &quot;Any difficulties? I
know Unit-14 is more touchy than earlier designs...&quot;

&quot;So far, we&#39;ve had no difficulties,&quot; Mana replied,
&quot;out tech teams have smoothed out the control
interface, and I&#39;m needing 35 less pain-killers to
operate it.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re working on stealing a original interface from
Tokyo-3,&quot; Nao confessed grimly, &quot;once we do you should
no longer have to deal with painful feedback.&quot;

&quot;Thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Mana replied quietly.

Nao gave her a perceptive look, seeing how tired the
girl actually was. &quot;You&#39;d best rest up,&quot; she ordered
gently, &quot;we&#39;ll have more work for you tomorrow.&quot;

Ignoring the girl&#39;s protests Nao ordered her to her
room, then walked to her window and gazed down at the
Evangelion in it&#39;s restraints. This was the
inheritance from her father Gendo and mother Naoko,
the peak of human creation and her own greatest
achievement. Or it would be, when she proved the
superiority of her work.

&#39;Mother,&#39; Nao thought, &#39;is this enough?&#39;

Naoko Akagi had been chief scientist of GHERIN,
working on the early Evangelion units when she became
pregnant by her lover, Gendo Ikari. Unwilling to stop
her work she had the fertilized egg implanted in a
surrogate, but Naoko died before the child was born.
Raised by allies at GHERIN her daughter Nao developed
her intellect and learned from her mother&#39;s journals,
as well as contacting the computer Magi.

&#39;Which I can&#39;t do now,&#39; Nao thought grimly, her hand
clenching into a fist. Somehow the Magi had become
impervious to outside contact recently, even using the
back doors her mother had installed in the system. Nao
didn&#39;t know why, but she suspected the new commander
of NERV was responsible, Misato Katsuragi.

Restless Nao left her office, walking the halls as she
visited various sections of the underground facility.
Built by NERV as a emergency base it was left
untouched by the war between SEELE and Gendo, and had
continued with it&#39;d development of Evangelion.
However, it had been created secretly by Gendo,
supplied covertly and was therefore without the latest
technology. Worse, they were cut off with the death of
their patron Gendo, and were now attempting to
continue their work entirely without support.

&#39;Just replacement parts alone are hideously
expensive,&#39; Nao mused as she walked through the
technology division, &#39;which is why we needed to sell
our Evangelion&#39;s services as a mercenary.&#39;

Shiro Tokida nodded respectfully to her as she passed,
the older man supervising checks on Unit-14&#39;s limbs.
The former chief of the Jet Alone project Nao had made
him a offer to escape the humiliation of that
project&#39;s failure, instead using his skills to develop
and maintain this new technology.

&quot;How are the system&#39;s holding up?&quot; Nao asked, looking
over his shoulder and studying the readouts knowingly.

&quot;Our cyborg limbs are grafting well on the basic
Evangelion core,&quot; Shiro pointed at the image of the
organic center of Evangelion in blue, the robotic arms
and legs in red, &quot;no signs of rejection yet.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Nao nodded, &quot;and the feedback issue?&quot;

Shiro deflated a bit at that, &quot;No progress yet, ma&#39;am.
In essence we&#39;re using the pilot as the brain of
Evangelion, and the stress is immense.&quot;

&quot;NERV solved the problem,&quot; Nao noted mildly, &quot;we can
too.&quot;

Shiro nodded, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

As Nao left she thought, &#39;Maybe I need to remind him
there are still people looking to charge him for the
near nuclear failure of Jet Alone. He could use
some... motivation.&#39;

Security was next, Nao pausing to run through staff
listings and estimates of their fighting forces. With
the possibility of NERV moving against them as well as
political instabilities in the region they needed a
strong fighting force other than Unit-14, and they
maintained a security force 300 strong.

After that Nao made her way downwards, reaching the
basements and the heart of NERV Alpha... a pulsing,
living piece of the life form found in the geofront
beneath Tokyo-3.

&quot;Lilith,&quot; Nao murmured as she stood on a platform and
watched as LCL fluid pumped from the piece of flesh,
the same material they grew their Evangelion from. Did
it feel pain, she often wondered, or have any
awareness of the world around it? Or was it merely a
piece of flesh, growing mindlessly to try to replicate
it&#39;s &#39;mother?&#39;

&quot;Either way,&quot; Nao murmured to herself, &quot;you are mine.
And I will never surrender you to anyone else.&quot;
