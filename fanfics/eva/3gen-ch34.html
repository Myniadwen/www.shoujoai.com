<h1>Third Genesis (part 34 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>&quot;All right,&quot; Asuka Soryu Langley said flatly as the
orange haired woman tightly gripped the controls of
Archangel, &quot;let&#39;s try this again.&quot; The screen they
were watching showed a split image, Asuka on one side
and the almost eerily human looking Archangel
bio-mechanical construct on the other side.

&quot;Prepare unit Alpha for launch,&quot; Maya Ibuki said
calmly. &quot;Open tertiary connections one through twenty
five.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Makoto Hyuga nodded, his glasses gleaming as
he confidently activated the required systems. He had
only recently returned to NERV but seemed to be
settling in nicely, as well as adapting to his former
co-worker being in charge.

&quot;She&#39;s taken well to command,&quot; Ritsuko noted proudly
from where the blonde scientist stood by Misato on the
upper deck.

&quot;Maya certainly looks more relaxed at it than I
felt,&quot; Misato confessed, the black haired woman
watching the goings on intently.

&quot;You never showed it,&quot; Ritsuko smiled.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato shrugged. Raising her voice she
asked, &quot;How does it feel, Asuka?&quot;

Asuka smiled back slightly, &quot;No headache so far.&quot;

Rei Ayanami gave a relieved smile from where she
waited on the command deck and murmured, &quot;Thank
goodness.&quot;

&quot;Open up the next twenty five for secondary
connection,&quot; Maya ordered.

&quot;Any systems problems?&quot; Yui Ikari asked, looking
strangely out of place as a boy in a lab coat. &quot;The
new virtual barriers for Asuka may generate some
problems.&quot;

&quot;Nothing yet,&quot; Satsuke Ooi answered, her long blonde
hair gleaming as the technician monitored the various
systems. 

&quot;Kaede, Aoi?&quot; Yui asked the other techs, getting
positive results from both women.

&quot;Medical monitors show green,&quot; Maya murmured then
looked up, &quot;Asuka?&quot;

&quot;Itching to go.&quot; Asuka quipped. 

Misato chuckled softly, &quot;Remind me to pout itching
powder in her plug suit.&quot;

Ritsuko gave her a look, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Misato smirked.

&quot;Bad girl,&quot; Ritsuko chided.

&quot;All right,&quot; Maya said firmly, &quot;first stage
connection, go.&quot;

&quot;This is where there were problems last time?&quot; Makoto
asked softly as he pressed the correct set of keys.

&quot;Correct.&quot; Yui answered softly.

&quot;Asuka?&quot; Rei asked, studying her girlfriend intently.

&quot;No headache,&quot; Asuka sounded relieved as she asked,
&quot;did that feedback wobble turn up again, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;No readings on feedback,&quot; Kaede said, pushing up her
own glasses as she checked the readings to be sure.

&quot;Medical monitors also read clear,&quot; the third tech,
Aoi, said crisply.

&quot;Release locks,&quot; Maya commanded, &quot;Unit Alpha, you&#39;re
free to move out.&quot;

&quot;Aye aye.&quot; Makoto grinned as he went to work,
switches releasing the support structure that helped
keep the usually depowered Archangel upright. With a
shudder the massive booms pulled back, then with a
almost inhuman grace the Archangel moved.

Rei moved forward unconsciously as she watched the
Archangel take it&#39;s first few steps. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot;
she murmured.

Yui sweatdropped. &quot;Anyway,:&quot; she said briskly,
&quot;Asuka, you all right in there.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Asuka growled as she made the Archangel pace
around the underground enclosure, &quot;for the third time.
What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Back into the locks for now,&quot; Maya said briskly, &quot;on
the weekend we&#39;ll deploy the Archangel outside the
city so you can really practice maneuvering it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to that,&quot; Misato murmured.

&quot;So we can move forward on operation: Shinji rescue?&quot;
Ritsuko asked teasingly as they watched Asuka
carefully move the Archangel back into place.

&quot;More like recovering Unit 01. Getting Shinji out of
it will be a whole other set of problems,&quot; Misato her
answered grimly. She looked up at Ritsuko and asked,
&quot;Has Yue had any luck researching Gendo&#39;s files?&quot;

&quot;Some preliminary notes relating to the creation of
the Rei clone were found,&quot; Ritsuko revealed, &quot;but not
much else yet. There&#39;s still a massive amount of data
to dig through.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t done much with those files.&quot;
Misato grumbled as Maya supervised the shutdown of
Unit Alpha, &quot;Gendo seemed to be a compulsive notes
taker. His journal was thousands of pages long....&quot;

&quot;We should dump it on mom,&quot; Ritsuko offered.

&quot;The Magi?&quot; Misato blinked, &quot;Yeah, I suppose so. I
just hope she doesn&#39;t hit anything too upsetting in
there.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s accepted Gendo&#39;s a sleeze,&quot; Ritsuko shrugged,
&quot;at least that&#39;s what the conversation Maya overheard
implies.&quot;

&quot;What, between her and Yui?&quot; Misato looked a bit
startled. &quot;Is it me, or is there something disturbing
about their being friends?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not just you,&quot; Ritsuko admitted.

Meanwhile, Asuka smiled as she took a towel from Rei
as she climbed out of the entry plug for the
Archangel. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiled as she toweled the LCL
off.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rei said with a smile before
stepping close and giving the still damp Asuka a firm
hug.

Asuka pulled her close even as she murmured, &quot;What
was that for?&quot;

&quot;I was worried,&quot; Rei explained simply.

Asuka blushed a bit, feeling that odd tingle of
pleasure inside that she got knowing that someone
cared. &quot;So was I,&quot; she conceded as they waked off,
&quot;bleeding from the nose the last two tests was not
fun.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least we know it works,&quot; Rei sighed as she
cuddled close to Asuka&#39;s side.

Asuka slid a arm around Rei as they walked through
NERV headquarters. &quot;Yeah, now on to the next bit,&quot; she
sighed, &quot;training with Aoba. Can we just go home now?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not looking forward to being beaten by our
new hand to hand instructor?&quot; Rei asked her teasingly.

&quot;Hell no,&quot; Asuka sighed.
