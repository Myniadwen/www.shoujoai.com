<h1>Altered Destinies (part 7 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>

<a href="../eva/altdest-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Shinji Ikari grabbed her breakfast quickly, popping up her toast even as 
she dumped out Pen Pen&#39;s can of sardines. &quot;Wonder how long it&#39;ll be 
before they&#39;re up?&quot; she young woman murmured to the penguin with 
amusement.

Pen Pen gave her a scolding look, as if she was asking foolish 
questions, then the penguin went back to scarfing it&#39;s food. The kitchen 
itself was lit up by the rising sun, a rose glow that lit up everything 
with that energy. The room was it&#39;s usual mess, but at least the kitchen 
table was clean enough for her to eat at.

&quot;Urgl,&quot; Ritsuko stumbled towards the coffee machine, her blonde hair 
messy from sleep. Behind her Misato made a beeline for the fridge, 
getting out a can of beer. &quot;Do you really have to do that?&quot; Ritsuko 
muttered.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Misato popped open the top then slammed the beer down, her 
oversized T-shirt and shorts chosen for comfort, not style.

&quot;Dumb question,&quot; Ritsuko sipped with a sigh.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Shinji said to them mildly, watching the two older women 
with mild amusement. Their usual morning routine had been a little 
startling to her at first, but she had gotten used to it over time. It 
helped that whatever bickering Misato and Ritsuko did was balanced out 
by their honest affection.

Ritsuko sat at the table and nursed her cup of coffee, her battered 
house coat wrapped around her. &quot;Please come by NERV after school,&quot; she 
sighed as she sipped, &quot;we need to run through some simulator training.&quot;

Reheating some takeout from last night Misato noted, &quot;If you need a ride 
I&#39;m sure we can ask Misato or Maya to haul you over.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you need to send officers out to get me,&quot; Shinji said, 
sweatdropping as the microwave binged and Misato popped it open, getting 
a fork and then digging in eagerly.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you eat that in the morning,&quot; Ritsuko grumbled as she 
put some more nice, safe toast on, &quot;and with beer, too.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a traditional Japanese breakfast,&quot; Misato defended herself 
cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;m just substituting beer for the sake, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Shinji got up, smiling wryly as she headed out, grabbing her school bag 
from where it waited by the front door. &quot;Have a good day,&quot; she called as 
she slipped her shoes on and went out the door, her uniform skirt 
swirling around her legs.

&quot;Thank god she didn&#39;t comment about last night,&quot; a smiling Ritsuko 
puffed out a sigh, &quot;we were a little loud.&quot;

&quot;Shinji usually wears her MP3 player during the evening,&quot; Misato said 
optimistically, &quot;maybe she didn&#39;t hear anything.&quot;

&#39;It&#39;s odd enough that I&#39;m living with two grown women who just happen to 
be lesbians,&#39; Shinji thought to herself as she reached the sidewalk and 
headed on towards the school, &#39;it&#39;s even stranger realizing that they 
actually have sex.&#39; After a short pause she muttered wryly, &quot;And really 
good sex too, by the sound of it.&quot;

The streets were still almost eerily silent in the early morning, only a 
small amount of traffic moving to work or carrying supplies for the 
city. Most of the people had left Tokyo-3 after the first Angel attack, 
and only a group of diehards and NERV employees were left, populating 
the massive city with such small numbers.

&quot;Ikari-chan,&quot; a girl&#39;s voice called.

Looking up Shinji saw Hikaru waiting at the usual place, the young 
woman&#39;s twin brown ponytails giving her a oddly young look. &quot;Morning,&quot; 
she smiled as she and Hikaru fell into step, a pattern they had 
developed over the past week or two.

&quot;I think Aida wants to talk to you,&quot; Hikaru looked amused as they walked 
on.

A blush colored Shinji&#39;s cheeks, her eyes rolling. The blonde haired boy 
had been pretty obvious in his crush on Shinji, and in all honesty she 
wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do about it. It wasn&#39;t that she disliked him, 
but there wasn&#39;t any spark between them, either.

&quot;Toji does, too,&quot; Hikaru added, giving Shinji a thoughtful look.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Shinji blinked.

Hikaru chuckled, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t think he intends to ask you out.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Shinji sighed. She looked over at Hikaru thoughtfully, 
&quot;Besides, I wouldn&#39;t want to get in your way.&quot;

Hikaru nearly stumbled, the other woman was so surprised. &quot;Is it that 
obvious?&quot; she asked her a bit uncomfortably.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Shinji said quietly, &quot;I guess that despite all your 
scolding of him, it seems that you care about him, too.&quot;

Hikaru chuckled uncomfortably, &quot;I just wish he&#39;d figure it out.&quot;

&quot;Have you tried to tell him?&quot; Shinji asked uncomfortably, glad that they 
were near the school. She was bad at this sort of thing, romance and all 
that, and felt very odd trying to give advice.

Hikaru gave her a amused look, &quot;We&#39;ve been friends forever, Shinji. It&#39;s 
a little hard to suddenly say that you&#39;re in love with him.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Shinji conceded.

The first bell rang out and they hurried through the main gate with the 
other students, rushing to their lockers then on to class. Grabbing her 
seat Shinji scanned the class, noting that Aida and Toji were already 
there, along with most of the others. Her eyes landed on Rei Ayanami, 
gazing forward with a oddly detached expression.

Then Rei turned her head, meeting Shinji&#39;s eyes as what had happened a 
few nights ago ran through her mind. They had been stationed on a rise, 
their Evangelion ready for battle, waiting for the signal to attack the 
latest Angel. Oddly spurred on by Rei&#39;s silence Shinji had found herself 
confessing her own odd hopelessness, the sense that whatever she did was 
all basically meaningless.

Rei&#39;s blue hair had been blown by the breeze as she gazed out at the 
Angel waiting for them. &quot;I fight for the Commander,&quot; she had finally 
said, &quot;that&#39;s enough for me.&quot;

&quot;Not for me,&quot; Shinji shook her head with a flash of anger.

Rei had studied her, &quot;Then find someone or something you want to fight 
for.&quot; The signal came and they climbed in their entry plugs. &quot;No matter 
what happens, I will protect you,&quot; Rei had said just before she climbed 
in, &quot;good bye.&quot;

Shinji shook herself as she pulled herself back to the classroom, 
noticing the quizzical look Rei was giving her. Giving back a sheepish 
smile Shinji focused her attention on the teacher, silently glad that he 
hadn&#39;t called on her while she was zoned out.

Slipping away with her lunch Shinji headed up to the roof, sitting under 
the sun as she unpacked her store bought bento. &#39;Good, I dodged Aida,&#39; 
she thought a bit guiltily as she ate. That was not a conversation she 
was looking forward to...

The door swung open and Shinji tensed, the frowned faintly as Toji 
walked out onto the roof. &quot;Ikari,&quot; he gave her a grim look, &quot;I want to 
talk to you.&quot;

&#39;Uh oh,&#39; Shinji thought then said, &quot;If it&#39;s about Aida, I like him but 
he&#39;s not really my type...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Toji cut her off, &quot;it&#39;s not about that.&quot; A short pause, &quot;It&#39;s 
really true, you are the pilot of that giant robot?&quot;

Shinji visibly winced. On her first day here, under the grilling of 
several students she had found herself blurting out that yes, she was 
the pilot of Evangelion. Not that it was too surprising that they&#39;d 
figure it out, considering she had arrived for school only days after 
it&#39;s first appearance and that they had already deduced Rei was also a 
pilot.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Shinji confessed as he walked over to her.

Toji looked down at her with a utterly unreadable expression on his 
face... then startlingly pulled her into a fierce hug!

&quot;Urk,&quot; Shinji squeaked even as she thought, &#39;God, I hope Hikaru doesn&#39;t 
come up here.&quot;

Releasing her as suddenly as he had hugged her Toji smiled faintly. &quot;You 
stopped the fight short of my family&#39;s apartment,&quot; he explained quietly, 
&quot;my sister was there, and I don&#39;t want to think what might have 
happened...&quot;

Shinji pulled away, walking over to the fence that circled the rooftop. 
&quot;Don&#39;t thank me,&quot; she said grimly, &quot;it was just dumb luck that she was 
saved.&quot; A pause, &quot;There were certainly enough killed that I don&#39;t feel 
very proud of it.&quot;

Joining her there Toji asked mildly, &quot;What do you want me to do, punch 
you?&quot;

Shinji barked laughter, &quot;No thanks, I don&#39;t like pain.&quot;

Toji shrugged slightly, &quot;It may not help, but just think how many people 
that thing might have killed if you hadn&#39;t stopped it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Shinji said softly.</pre>
