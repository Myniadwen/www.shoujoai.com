<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 4 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        &quot;I&#39;m a twentieth century digital boy,&quot; Shinji wailed off tune 
in the kareoke booth, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to live but I&#39;ve got a lot of 
toys!&quot;

        Asuka was laying back in her seat, her long orange hair spread 
out around her, a can of beer sitting beside her. Once Shinji finished 
she smiled cheerfully, &quot;Not bad.&quot;

        Shinji stumbled a bit, then looked at Asuka curiously. He 
pushed his black hair out of his face before offering, &quot;You really are 
drunk, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        Asuka smiled up at him blearily from where she was sitting and 
slurred, &quot;I&#39;m not as think as you drunk I am.&quot;

        Rei had to sweatdrop at that. &quot;I suppose that it&#39;s my turn 
now?&quot; the blue haired girl asked the others warily.

        &quot;Looks like it,&quot; Shinji smiling, picking up his own can of 
beer and drinking cautiously.

        &quot;Go for it!&quot; a cheering Asuka waved a hand excitedly, 
thankfully not the one that was holding her half full can of beer.

        Rei peered down at the selection with a feeling of dread, 
swiftly running through the long list of sweet pop ballads. She 
finally settled on an late twentieth century song and brought it up, a 
slight smile appearing on her pale face as she began to sing,

        &quot;These mist covered mountains are a home now to me.
        But my home is the lowlands, and always will be,
        Someday you&#39;ll return to your valleys and your farms,
        And you&#39;ll no longer yearn to be brothers in arms...&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence as Rei finished, gently 
returning the microphone to it&#39;s holder. She moved a bit 
self-consciously back to her seat and as she passed him Shinji reached 
up to pat her on the shoulder. The two exchanged a short glance, one 
of two soldiers that were growing weary of the war they were trapped 
in.

        Asuka sniffled softly, a few tears glistening on her cheeks. 
&quot;That was so sad,&quot; she looked up at Rei, &quot;but still, so KAWAII!&quot; She 
staggered to her feet and threw her arms around the clearly startled 
Rei, then broke into loud sobs.

        &quot;Help,&quot; Rei looked wide eyed at Shinji.

        Shinji just shrugged, clearly saying that he had no idea what 
to do, either.

        Asuka finally eased off in her crying and disengaged, pulling 
back just a bit to look up at Rei. &quot;You know,&quot; she said muzzily, &quot;you 
really are a wonderful human being, you know that...&quot; she trailed off 
then slumped to the ground, out cold.

        &quot;Thank god,&quot; Rei sweatdropped, trying very hard not to think 
of how it felt to have her boss&#39; body pressed up against her own.

        Shinji looked down at the passed out, and now loudly snoring 
Asuka and sighed, &quot;Guess we&#39;ll have to load her into a taxi and get 
her back to base.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Asuka bent down, getting one arm over her shoulders, 
Shinji getting the other side. &quot;Oof,&quot; she gasped, &quot;she&#39;s pretty heavy 
for a lieutenant.&quot;

        A slight smile from Shinji as they moved out into the hall, 
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s going to be telling her that.&quot;

        It was early the next morning and there was an odd silence on 
the bridge as Misato looked down suspiciously as her second in command 
brought her another cup of coffee without her even asking. &quot;All right, 
what&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked crisply.

        &quot;Going on?&quot; Ritsuko smiled. The tall blonde pushed her hair 
back from her face, &quot;What could possibly be going on?&quot;

        Misato sat up in her chair, her eyes narrowing. &quot;Ever since we 
were roomies together,&quot; the black haired Captain gave her a look, 
&quot;you&#39;ve pulled this &#39;I&#39;ll be especially nice to Misato for awhile&#39; 
trick before you ask me for something.&quot;

        Maya paled, looking down at her controls nervously. &#39;I hope 
that Sempai knows what she&#39;s doing,&#39; she silently fretted.

        Ritsuko smiled slightly, &quot;Well, there was something...&quot;

        Misato had to smile slightly, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        Ritsuko took a steadying breath. &quot;How are you at performing 
marriages, Captain?&quot; she finally asked with a grin.

        Misato&#39;s eyes widened, then slid to the now faintly blushing 
Maya. &quot;You two?&quot; she shook her head, &quot;You sly dog!&quot;

        &quot;Is that a no?&quot; Maya had to ask tentatively.

        Misato grinned, &quot;That&#39;s a firm yes!&quot; She sat back in her 
command chair, &quot;Do you want me to just do it, or do you want a bit of 
ceremony first?&quot;

        Maya and Ritsuko exchanged a surprised look, obviously not 
having even considered that. From his station Makoto chuckled to 
himself softly, getting a glare from both of them. The brown haired 
young man busied himself with his work, but kept on smiling.

        &quot;A ceremony, I think,&quot; Ritsuko finally got her brain going 
again.

        Maya rewarded her with a beaming smile, then the younger woman 
froze as a thought hit her. &quot;What are we going to wear?&quot; she squeaked.

        Makoto nearly laughed aloud, quickly covering it with a cough. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he smiled, &quot;I must be coming down with something.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; Ritsuko had to smile too as she looked 
up at the Captain, &quot;and let you know when we&#39;re ready.&quot;

        &quot;You do that,&quot; Misato smiled.

        In another part of the massive ship Asuka groaned to herself 
softly. It felt like the ship was being hit with giant hammers, or 
maybe it was all just in her head. Keep in her eyes firmly shut she 
tried to focus past the pounding headache to listen if any alarms were 
really going off, and felt relieved that she didn&#39;t hear any.

        &quot;Thank gott,&quot; Asuka muttered softly.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; the soft voice asked her softly.

        Asuka&#39;s eyes popped open in surprise, wincing a bit at the dim 
light. Rei Ayanami lay beside her, her short blue hair messy a bit 
from sleep. She was wearing an oversized T-shirt that covered all of 
her naughty bits, mostly, but gave a good hint of the curves 
underneath.

        &#39;What the hell happened last night?&#39; Asuka thought, running 
through her foggy memories wildly. She remembered eating dinner and 
fending off Minmei, then the three had headed out together. Renting a 
kareoke booth, Shinji singing while the buzz of beer made everything 
tolerable, then Ayanami took her turn...

        Then she drew a blank.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rei repeated a bit worriedly.

        &quot;Shh,&quot; Asuka held up a finger. &quot;I&#39;ve got such a headache,&quot; she 
muttered, realizing that wherever she was, it was not her quarters. 
&#39;I&#39;m in Ayanami&#39;s room? Damn it, what happened last night?&#39; she tried 
not to panic.

        With a little smile on her face Rei got up off the bed and 
softly said, &quot;I&#39;ll go get you some aspirin, then.&quot; She walked away 
from Asuka, clearly revealing that the T-shirt did not conceal her 
panty covered bottom.

        Asuka found herself watching that bottom sway for a few 
moments, then had to shake herself. &#39;What&#39;s up with me this morning?&#39; 
she wondered. It didn&#39;t much help that when Rei brought her the 
aspirin she bent over, giving Asuka a perfect view of round, nicely 
shaped breasts.

        &quot;You really do look pretty pale,&quot; Rei remarked as she passed 
her a glass of orange juice to wash the pills down with.

        After the headache began to die down Asuka tentatively asked, 
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything... too inappropriate last night, did I?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rei answered softly, &quot;how do you define 
inappropriate?&quot;

        &quot;Oh god,&quot; Asuka put her hands over her face.

        Rei smiled gently, &quot;You got a bit drunk, we sang some kareoke, 
and you passed out.&quot;

        &quot;And how did I get here?&quot; Asuka asked softly.

        Rei shrugged, &quot;My suite was closest.&quot;

        With a bit of a blush Asuka asked, &quot;And we.. slept together in 
here?&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Rei reassured her, &quot;I was a perfect gentleman.&quot;
