<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 9 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/wildhorse-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>I just wanted to take a minute to submit my rational behind Asuka&#39;s 
acceptance of Ranma&#39;s curse. Mainly, I wanted to do something different. 
Almost everyone would expect Asuka to react with ridicule, and that&#39;s 
probably accurate. However, there are factors here that I believe would 
mitigate that to some extent. First off, Asuka isn&#39;t the type of girl 
that hides her attraction to a guy. Look at how shamelessly she pursued 
Kaji. She is attracted to Ranma&#39;s guy form and she has also respects him 
as a fellow warrior, especially after the scene with Fuyutsuki. Thus she 
has a choice, alienate someone she respects and is attracted too by 
ridiculing him, or accept it as move on. I had her choose the more 
mature course.

I also would like to apologize to anyone that was offended about Ranma&#39;s 
turn of phrase when he implied that soldiers were ass-kissers. That was 
more a case of Ranma putting his foot in his mouth and it was certainly 
not my personal view. I just didn&#39;t realize how harsh it sounded until I 
posted the chapter.

The last chapter marked a transition for the story. It will become much 
more serious now, darker, but also more WAFFy as the romance factor 
kicks into gear.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That&#39;s Ranma for you,&quot; Nabiki said to Kasumi while the fianc&eacute;e brigade 
ranted to each other about Ranma collecting more girls. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
why it is, but he seems to draw girls in like a homing beacon wherever 
he goes.&quot;

Nodoka hid her grin behind her hand at the comment. She didn&#39;t know why 
there was a shrine to Bastet, the ancient Egyptian Goddess of fertility, 
in Japan, but when she found out about the Goddess&#39;s area of influence, 
she had to go in and pray for a blessing for her then unborn son. She 
wanted lots of grandchildren after all.

Nodoka&#39;s look turned dark as she fixed her husband with a baleful glare. 
Of course, Genma had done everything in his power to counteract the 
blessing, starting with the Nekoken, then telling Ranma that women were 
a distraction from the Art and ensuring that any experience that Ranma 
did have with a woman was an unmitigated disaster.

Nodoka sighed. Ranma so loved cats before her husband took him away on 
that foolish training journey. It indicated Ranma&#39;s affinity to the 
Goddess that blessed him.

Nodoka turned her attention from her battered husband to the TV as 
Nabiki started the next episode of Ranma&#39;s adventure.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;My goodness, this is delicious, Ranma,&quot; Kaji said as he finished 
eating. &quot;You&#39;ll make someone a fine wife someday.&quot;

Asuka, Misato, and Ritsuko all snickered. Rei sat impassively as always. 
Ranma was not amused, as was made clear when a chopstick went sailing 
across the table to smack Kaji across the forehead hard enough to leave 
a bruise.

&quot;Owwie!&quot; Kaji exclaimed, rubbing the reddening line across his forehead.

&quot;Oh gee, sorry about that, Kaji,&quot; Ranma said sweetly. &quot;It seems my 
chopstick got away from me.&quot;

Asuka, Misato, and Ritsuko snickered louder and even Rei&#39;s lips quirked 
into a fleeting smile.

&quot;So when do I get to see this magical transformation of yours?&quot; Kaji 
asked, trying to ignore the fact that he hadn&#39;t even seen Ranma move 
when she hit him with the eating utensil.

Rei, who was sitting beside Ranma, reached over and dumped her tea on 
Ranma&#39;s head.

&quot;I guess now would be as good a time as any,&quot; the now-male Ranma 
deadpanned, shooting a look at Rei.

Rei developed a hint of a smile but it was gone before anyone but Ranma 
saw it. Ranma sighed and turned back to Kaji and began to explain the 
curse. Several minutes and a few demonstrations later, courtesy of 
Asuka, who was sitting on Ranma&#39;s other side, and Rei, Kaji was looking 
at Ranma intrigued.

&quot;Wow,&quot; the older man grinned lecherously. &quot;What I could do if I could do 
that.&quot;

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Misato growled as both she and Ritsuko looked a bit green at 
the prospect.

&quot;You&#39;d probably get your ass kicked a lot,&quot; Ranma commented, causing 
Misato and Ritsuko to laughingly agree.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma stared at the ceiling. She was not a happy camper. It wasn&#39;t 
because she was currently female. Nor was it because she was banished 
into this weird world that appeared to be based on an apocalyptic anime. 
No, she was not happy because she wasn&#39;t going to make it to the end of 
the anime to have to worry about seeing an apocalypse.

She was quite certain her life would be forfeit as soon as the two 
sleeping girls on either side of her awoke. As per Misato&#39;s plan, Ranma 
and Asuka would be sleeping in the same room. Misato would be joining 
them to chaperone, talk about leaving the fox to guard the henhouse, and 
just so she didn&#39;t get left out, Rei had also joined them.

Thus the living room was the current location of four futons containing 
three sleeping women and one wide-awake, sometimes-female, pig-tailed 
martial artist who was currently pursuing a fatalistic train of thought.

A camera flash suddenly illuminated the room. Correction, the room now 
contained two sleeping women, one fatalistic, some-times female, 
wide-awake martial artist, and a &#39;chaperone&#39; wearing a wicked grin and 
holding a camera.

And just what was the reason for said martial artist&#39;s morbid opinion of 
her life expectancy and the &#39;chaperone&#39;s&#39; wicked grin? That would have 
everything to do with the fact that the two sleeping girls were 
currently tightly snuggled up to the martial artist in question. Worse 
yet, one of the girls currently had a handful of a well-developed fleshy 
formation on the martial artist&#39;s chest with a leg thrown over between 
Ranma&#39;s own for good measure. The other girl&#39;s hand was resting on 
Ranma&#39;s lower belly, dangerously close to somewhere that would have 
been...improper, and she too had a leg thrown over both Ranma&#39;s and the 
other girl&#39;s.

Suddenly, Misato appeared in Ranma&#39;s view as the redhead stared at the 
ceiling while contemplating her doom. Misato&#39;s grin had become downright 
evil now. She presented a kettle for Ranma&#39;s inspection. Ranma&#39;s eyes 
widened as she immediately grasped the older woman&#39;s intent. Her eyes 
began to plead as she mouthed silent denials. This only made Misato&#39;s 
eyes sparkle with mirth and her grin to grow larger as she began to 
carefully tip the kettle, dribbling just enough hot water to trigger the 
change, and then courteously toweling off the water.

The girls shifted and mumbled a little in their sleep as Ranma&#39;s greater 
male mass displaced them slightly. The hand on his chest squeezed his 
now hard pectoral muscle a couple of times before relaxing again. The 
other hand that was resting dangerously close to somewhere unmentionable 
was no longer merely close; the matter was firmly in hand, as it were. 
This hand also gave a few experimental squeezes, causing Ranma to stifle 
a gasp and turn beet-red.

Ranma&#39;s eyes tracked his betrayer as she walked around the room and set 
the kettle down, once again picking up her camera. Several flashes 
later, the traitorous woman settled down with a cup of tea to await the 
festivities bound to happen when the girls awoke. Not content to allow 
things to happen at their own pace and thus allowing Ranma a few more 
precious moments of life to live, Misato grinned as she set the alarm 
clock to go off in another five minutes.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka awoke to the sound of her alarm clock. She was feeling very warm 
and comfortable and really didn&#39;t want to get up, but the alarm was 
insistent. Slowly, her brain was banishing the fog of sleep from her 
mind as it brought her systems online. Her internal diagnostics told her 
she was comfortably warm and had a wonderful night&#39;s sleep, a rare thing 
for her since she was almost always plagued with nightmares that would 
leave her feeling drained in the morning.

Internal systems checked, her awareness expanded to her outer condition. 
This revealed she was snuggled up to her nice warm pillow. Her leg was 
thrown over it and a few exploratory squeezes revealed her hand was 
firmly grasping its thick handle. The pillow was inflating and deflating 
slightly in a relaxing, even repetition...wait a minute!

Firstly, her mind told her, pillows don&#39;t inflate and deflate. Secondly, 
they don&#39;t typically have handles either. Thirdly, she couldn&#39;t ever 
remember a pillow being quite this warm and firm. Asuka&#39;s blue eyes 
snapped open and she froze.

(oO\O/Oo)

Meanwhile, Rei was running similar diagnostics as she too was pulled 
from her sleep by the wretched alarm. Her start up sequence was much 
faster than Asuka&#39;s, as was her grasp of her position. Add to this her 
lack of indoctrination to popular social dogma, meant rather than 
panicking, she simply lay there enjoying the warm feeling of being 
cuddled up to her Ranma. Thus, her crimson eyes were open and a content 
smile graced her lips when Asuka&#39;s blue eyes popped open wide and met 
Rei&#39;s as a deep blush colored her cheeks.

Rei winked at the redhead reassuringly and her content smile grew a 
little bigger as her crimson eyes flicked upward suggestively, conveying 
to Asuka to follow her lead.

(oO\O/Oo)

Sweat began to form on Ranma&#39;s brow as he recognized by their breathing 
and investigative groping that the alarm had done its job in waking the 
girls up. Any minute now, he&#39;d be a dead man. He felt the redhead 
pressed to his left side stiffen in alarm. The blue-haired girl, in 
contrast, remained relaxed.

He watched as two pairs of eyes, one set crimson and one set azure, 
slowly looked up to meet his own stormy-ocean blue ones. He gulped and 
waited for the unspeakable violence to begin.

Therefore, he was quite surprised when he felt the blushing redhead 
relax with a little sigh as she smiled at him and gave him a little 
squeeze before removing her hand almost reluctantly from its place on 
his body. His brain completely blew a circuit when they both craned 
upwards and gave him a little kiss on their respective cheeks before 
Asuka spoke.

&quot;Good morning, Handsome,&quot; she said softly, settling back in for another 
momentary snuggle before she sat up.

Rei just gave him a shy smile and little squeeze before she too sat up.

&quot;Morning, Girls,&quot; Misato chirped with a teasing grin. &quot;Did you sleep 
well?&quot;

&quot;That was the best night&#39;s sleep I can ever remember,&quot; Asuka smiled, 
blushing a little darker if that was possible.

&quot;I too feel more rested than is customary,&quot; Rei commented.

&quot;How about you, Ran...ma...&quot; Misato trailed off as she looked at the boy 
who had taken advantage of his freedom when the girls let go of him. He 
was currently curled into a tight fetal ball in the corner of the room 
with his arms held protectively around his head. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s with you?&quot;

The girls looked around and saw Ranma quivering in the corner looking 
like a terrified young child about to be beaten by a drunk, abusive 
stepfather.

Now ordinarily, aside from cats, Ranma wasn&#39;t afraid of anything, as he 
would normally be quick to point out, especially not physical abuse. 
However, there were several factors here that were working against his 
mental state. Among these was the fact that he was in this 
world-not-his-own facing a rather grim demise. There was also Akane&#39;s 
conditioning, which was normally suppressed, where any contact with a 
girl would lead to immediate and brutal consequences. And then, there 
was his confusion at how comfortable he was being snuggled. But the 
biggest factor that led to his current reaction was guilt. Ranma felt an 
enormous amount of guilt that he had been enjoying the feelings of the 
two young girls snuggled tightly against him and the feelings of their 
hands on his body.

Because he liked having the girls snuggled up to him, in his mind, that 
equated to him having taken advantage of them and therefore he lost the 
moral high ground he would normally have clung to when he wound up in a 
compromising situation with a girl. Add to that the girls were only 
fourteen while he was, in reality, seventeen, made him feel like a true 
pervert. Of course, it wasn&#39;t lost on him that a less than three year 
age difference was nothing in terms of adult relationships and there was 
the fact that his father and Mr. Tendo were going to make him marry Mr. 
Tendo if he wasn&#39;t able to get his curse unlocked that time with Herb. 
That thought made him shudder. However, the first thought didn&#39;t really 
help him much, and the second made him feel even dirtier.

So Ranma sat in the corner fully believing that he deserved to be beaten 
to death, or at least into a coma, in a brutal manner and fully expected 
for the beating to commence as soon as the girls found suitable weapons. 
They had each given him the Kiss of Death after all. It was completely 
lost on him that the kisses might have meant something else entirely.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; Rei asked softly as she reached out to touch him.

The boy flinched away with a whimper. Nothing the girls or Misato did 
could coax the boy out of his defensive ball. He just begged them to 
kill him and get it over with. After an hour of coaxing, Misato realized 
that there was something horribly wrong here, so she called in support 
in the form of Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

(oO\O/Oo)

An hour and a half after Ritsuko had arrived and managed to coax Ranma 
into his room, she stepped out and slid the door shut with exaggerated 
care. The blonde doctor then walked down the hallway, past the three 
expectant-looking women gathered at the table, and out onto the patio. 
Misato&#39;s eyes bugged when she saw her normally cool and unflappable 
friend begin to destroy her patio furniture in a fit of rage-fueled 
violence while issuing a string of multi-lingual profanity that would 
have made a gangsta-rapper blush.

Once there was nothing left on the patio bigger then a fist to destroy, 
Ritsuko straightened her clothes and combed her hair back into place 
with her fingers. Taking a few breaths, she turned calmly and reentered 
the condo, seating herself at the table.

&quot;Um...Ritsuko? What the hell was that about?&quot; Misato asked carefully.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ritsuko said, not really sounding sorry at all. &quot;I had to vent 
before I did something...rash.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Misato said, not seeing. &quot;And how is Ranma?&quot;

&quot;Ranma is fine for now,&quot; Ritsuko answered calmly. &quot;I gave him a sedative 
to calm him down.&quot;

&quot;So what happened?&quot; Misato prompted, beginning to get irritated that she 
was having to pry the answers from the blonde who had just laid waste to 
her patio.

&quot;It seems that before being summoned to Tokyo-3 by his father, Ranma was 
forced to live in the same house with a psychotic bitch,&quot; Ritsuko said, 
closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. &quot;It seems that the girl would 
accuse him of being a pervert and beat him with a variety of blunt, 
sometimes makeshift, weapons for so much as speaking to a girl. At the 
time, he was also being pursued by several other violent psychopaths 
that would throw themselves at him. This always resulted in him being 
beaten severely by one or more of them.&quot;

&quot;Daaamn,&quot; Misato said in dismay. Suddenly, a lot of the reactions Ranma 
had to even a hint of flirting made a lot more sense.

&quot;Essentially, Ranma has been conditioned that any affectionate contact 
with girls will result in large amounts of pain immediately thereafter,&quot; 
Ritsuko explained.

&quot;So he&#39;s going to do this every time a girl expresses an interest in 
him?&quot; Misato asked incredulously.

&quot;Well, the reaction this morning was rather extreme because of the added 
component of guilt he felt,&quot; Ritsuko explained. &quot;Unlike the other times, 
where he didn&#39;t welcome the contact nor was even attracted to the girls 
for the most part, he believes he took advantage of Rei and Asuka 
because he&#39;s attracted to them and enjoyed being cuddled with them. 
Because of this, he feels that he deserves to be &#39;beaten to death for 
his crimes&#39;. He even thinks the girls both gave him something called the 
Kiss of Death, which is apparently some sort of declaration of intent to 
hunt you to the ends of the Earth to kill you in some primitive Chinese 
Amazon culture he was exposed to.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding?&quot; Misato asked weakly.

&quot;I wish I was,&quot; Ritsuko said tiredly.

The blonde doctor looked over at the girls and goggled. Asuka was 
staring wide-eyed in shock, which was understandable. It was Rei that 
truly stunned Ritsuko. The girl she had come to think of as being as 
cold and emotionless as a machine sat there with tears streaming down 
her cheeks.

&quot;Rei? Why are you crying?&quot; Ritsuko asked, curious.

&quot;Because it saddens me that Ranma believes I wish to kill him,&quot; Rei 
answered. &quot;It angers me that he was tormented so. And it frustrates me 
that I wish to help him, but my presence will only make him feel worse.&quot;

Asuka looked over at the other girl. After a moment, the redhead pulled 
the other girl into a hug and Rei&#39;s floodgates opened. She began to sob 
into the redhead&#39;s shoulder, which took Ritsuko completely aback.

&quot;So what can we do?&quot; Misato asked.

Ritsuko looked at the two girls appraisingly, then down at the photos 
Misato had taken of the three of them this morning.

&quot;Am I to understand that the two of you are interested in something more 
than friendship with Ranma?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;I-I...g-guess so,&quot; Asuka stammered, blushing deeply.

Rei didn&#39;t answer. She just nodded her head as she cried on Asuka&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Ritsuko remarked. &quot;Typically, conditioning can be broken by 
showing the conditioned person positive responses to the events they 
have been conditioned against. In this case, this can be achieved by 
demonstrating to Ranma that it&#39;s okay to accept the affection of girls 
without being beaten and that the proper response is to return that 
affection.&quot;

&quot;S-so w-we can h-help him by showing him affection?&quot; Rei hiccoughed 
hopefully, pulling herself together and disengaging from Asuka.

&quot;It won&#39;t be easy,&quot; Ritsuko cautioned. &quot;It won&#39;t happen overnight, but 
yes, I think you can help him. He likes both of you so inside he wants 
you to show him affection. He just needs to learn that accepting it 
won&#39;t make him a pervert or get him beaten. I can tell you one thing, if 
I ever see those psychotic little bitches that did this to him, I swear 
I&#39;ll put a bullet in their abusive little heads.&quot;

&quot;Geez, Ritsuko,&quot; Misato said in surprise, glancing at her destroyed 
patio. &quot;You seem awfully emotional about this. It&#39;s not like you.&quot;

&quot;I guess Ranma sort of grew on me,&quot; Ritsuko blushed. &quot;He&#39;s a good kid. 
He&#39;s got his father&#39;s drive, but he actually cares about people. Lord 
knows why with the shit he&#39;s been through. That appeals to me. He also 
reminded me that I am human after all.&quot;

&quot;He is a little charmer,&quot; Misato agreed.

&quot;So will you girls be trying to help Ranma with this problem?&quot; Ritsuko 
asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei said softly, nodding before looking at Asuka.

Asuka blushed and looked down before hesitantly nodding.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka wondered just what the hell she was thinking. Sure, Ranma was cute 
in guy form and all and she thought he was really strong. Look at the 
way he dealt with the Sub-commander. That took some serious guts.

But cowering in terror because a girl snuggled you? That wasn&#39;t very 
strong at all and it was a serious turn-off for Asuka. She hated weak 
men that couldn&#39;t deal with women...like her father.

Yet, she had agreed to this plan. She had in effect agreed to be Ranma&#39;s 
girlfriend. Not only that, she had agreed to share him with Ayanami. And 
what about Ranma&#39;s girl form, her near identical twin? Could she truly 
have a relationship with what in effect would be another girl, maybe 
even two girls counting Ayanami?

Ayanami herself was pretty weird too. The girl came off as cold as ice 
most times. The only time Asuka had seen any warmth come from her it had 
been related to Ranma. Thinking about how the little ice maiden had 
broken down when the Doctor told them what was wrong with Ranma, it was 
clear that she was completely in love with the boy.

Yet she was willing to share him when Asuka had been disappointed that 
they were dating. In retrospect, Ranma probably had no idea they had 
been dating. Still, did Asuka have any right to involve herself with 
Ayanami&#39;s boyfriend, even if Ayanami had offered?

Asuka sighed. For all that she tried to argue herself out of it, there 
was something about Ranma that drew her in, made her want him, made her 
feel complete. He intrigued her and fired her imagination. And she 
couldn&#39;t forget how comfortable she was snuggled up to him.

She blushed as she thought of what else she was touching as well. That 
memory was firing more than her imagination. Oh yes, it would be fun 
breaking Ranma&#39;s conditioning, showering him with affection. After all, 
she had to, for his own good. He was her friend after all and what kind 
of friend would she be if she let him down in this? Nope, Asuka decided, 
she, Asuka Langley Sohryu, was going to snuggle that conditioning right 
out of Ranma&#39;s head. Asuka&#39;s face lit up with a slightly perverted grin.

&quot;Perhaps we should go see if Ranma is prepared for today&#39;s training,&quot; 
Rei asked.

Asuka looked up and saw Rei was also wearing a slightly lecherous grin.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Asuka nodded. &quot;We do only have six days. Time&#39;s awastin&#39;.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Toji and Kensuke were on their way to Misato&#39;s apartment to check on 
Ranma. They hadn&#39;t seen him since they had gotten off the carrier and 
that had been over a week ago. They had become concerned for their 
friend after the battle a few days ago when they still hadn&#39;t seen him. 
So they were going to pay him a visit to make sure he was still in one 
piece.

As they entered the building, they ran into the Class Rep.

&quot;Hey Class Rep, what are you doing here?&quot; Toji asked.

&quot;I&#39;m here to drop off Asuka and Ranma&#39;s class work,&quot; Hikari said. &quot;What 
are you guys doing here?&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t seen Ranma since the trip to the carrier,&quot; Toji answered. 
&quot;We were gonna drop by and make sure the Red Demon didn&#39;t feast on his 
liver or something.&quot;

&quot;Toji! Asuka isn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Hikari protested in exasperation.

&quot;I never said it was Asuka I was talking about,&quot; Toji smirked. &quot;You 
figured that out all by yourself.&quot;

Hikari developed an eye-twitch as the three boarded the elevator. It was 
still twitching when the pushed the door chime for Misato&#39;s apartment.

&quot;Cooooming,&quot; an odd sounding voice said over the intercom.

After a minute the door opened, causing Toji and Kensuke to recoil in 
shock. Hikari blinked. In the door way stood two nearly identical 
pigtailed redheads. They were both wearing a pair of black spandex 
shorts, a leotard, one blue the other red, and a loose half top, blue 
and red respectively.

&quot;Helloooo,&quot; the pair eerily sang in sync with each other.

&quot;GAH!&quot; Toji cried, tears pouring down his cheeks. &quot;It&#39;s worse than I 
thought! She&#39;s begun to assimilate him! He&#39;s turning into her minion!&quot;

&quot;W-what&#39;s going on?&quot; Hikari asked.

&quot;It was Misato&#39;s idea,&quot; the pair explained in exact sync, creeping the 
other three out. &quot;We have to do everything together; eat together, train 
together, sleep together.&quot;

&quot;GAH!&quot; Hikari said, recoiling herself. &quot;T-that&#39;s not proper!&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Misato asked, walking up. &quot;Ranma sleeps in girl form and it&#39;s 
just sleeping. It&#39;s all part of the training.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot; Hikari asked.

Everyone entered the condo. Entering the family room, the trio of 
non-residents saw a strange sight. Rei was seated at the table with Pen 
Pen standing in front of her on top of the book she had evidently been 
trying to read. They were locked in a staring match.

&quot;Do I even wanna know?&quot; Kensuke asked with a huge sweat-drop.

&quot;They&#39;ve been at that since breakfast,&quot; the redheads said in unison.

&quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot; Toji asked out of morbid fascination.

At that point Pen Pen squawked indignantly and stalked off down the 
hallway. The blue haired girl calmly resumed reading her book.

&quot;Rei just won the fifth straight rematch,&quot; the redheads chirped. &quot;He&#39;ll 
be back though.&quot;

&quot;Could you guys like stop that?&quot; Toji asked. &quot;It&#39;s really creepy.&quot;

The redheads looked at each other and shrugged in sync before giggling 
and creeping everyone out.

(oO\O/Oo)

Toji, Kensuke, Rei, Misato, and Hikari sat around the table. Everyone 
but Hikari was watching the redheads practice to The Ride of the 
Valkyries, Ranma&#39;s personal modification to the plan. Hikari had gotten 
drawn into a staring contest with the penguin who figured he would get 
in some confidence training with an easier target before his rematch 
with Rei.

While it was hard to tell which redhead was which at a first or even 
second glance, it readily became apparent when they began the exercise. 
Ranma, in the blue leotard, had the routine down pat, moving through it 
like a kata she had been practicing for years. Asuka, in the red 
leotard, was having problems keeping time as the glowing circles on the 
mat below them lit up.

&quot;ARRRGH!&quot; Asuka finally screamed in frustration and threw her headphones 
against the wall. &quot;This is impossible.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not impossible, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma said gently. She stepped up 
behind the other redhead and began massaging the tension out of her neck 
and shoulders. Asuka melted under Ranma&#39;s ministrations. &quot;You just need 
to relax and don&#39;t get so frustrated.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Asuka moaned as Ranma worked the knots out of her neck muscles. 
&quot;Easy for you to say, Little Miss 
I-get-every-thing-perfect-on-the-first-try.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma smirked, but admitted, &quot;not always. Sometimes it takes me a 
while, but the thing is; I never give up. If you give up and say it&#39;s 
impossible then it will be. Now come on. Let&#39;s try it again. When we get 
it right I&#39;ll take you and Rei out for some ice cream. How&#39;s that 
sound?&quot;

&quot;Variable-chan, you really know how to motivate a girl, dontcha?&quot; Asuka 
smirked, using her pet name for Ranma.

&quot;Heh, I wonder why? Go figure,&quot; Ranma snorted.

(oO\O/Oo)

Two hours later, Asuka was going through the routine without missing a 
beat when Ranma called a break.

&quot;Heh, well I think we&#39;re gonna be ready,&quot; Ranma grinned proudly. &quot;How 
about the Evas, Misato? Are they gonna be ready by the time D-day gets 
here?&quot;

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Misato chirped. &quot;The Evas have been ready for two days 
now.&quot;

Ranma froze, her grin fading as her left eye began to twitch. Slowly, 
with great care, she walked up to Misato and placed her hands on the 
woman&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;So you&#39;re telling me that the Evas have been operational for two whole 
days now?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said,&quot; Misato nodded, Ranma&#39;s behavior confusing her.

&quot;THEN WHY THE HELL HAVEN&#39;T WE GONE OUT THERE AND KILLED THE GODDAM ANGEL 
WHILE IT&#39;S NOT MOVING AND VULNERABLE?&quot; Ranma screamed, a cross shaped 
vein appearing on her temple as the force of her shout blew Misato&#39;s 
hair straight back from her head.

Misato blinked. Everyone else at the table blinked. It was so 
ridiculously obvious. Hikari got it. Kensuke could see it. Toji figured 
even his sister could have seen something that obvious. Even Pen Pen was 
looking at Misato incredulously.

&quot;WHHHAAA!&quot; Misato wailed. &quot;It was all Kaji&#39;s plan! Yell at him not 
meeee!&quot;

&quot;I suggest you get on the phone to NERV and tell them to get Unit&#39;s 01 
and 02 ready to go out,&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;Asuka and I are going out and 
dealing with this thing before it finishes regenerating itself and gets 
back up to full power.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Rei? May I have a word with you?&quot; Ritsuko asked the blue-haired girl as 
Ranma and Asuka got suited up to take the Evas out.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rei said dispassionately.

Ritsuko led them to her office.

&quot;Please sit,&quot; Ritsuko directed as she sat behind her desk. She waited 
for Rei to sit and began. &quot;So how are things with Ranma?&quot;

&quot;Ranma has shown satisfactory progress under our deprogramming efforts,&quot; 
Rei reported. &quot;I am hopeful that he will soon no longer fear intimacy.&quot;

&quot;Excellent,&quot; Ritsuko nodded. &quot;However, there is one word of caution I 
need to impress on you. It would perhaps be best if the Commander was 
kept unaware of your developing relationship with his son. If he finds 
out just how much you care for Ranma, he may take steps to break you two 
apart.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Rei said tonelessly. &quot;Why would the Commander do such a thing?&quot;

&quot;Because he&#39;s an unhappy man, Rei,&quot; Ritsuko sighed. &quot;And he resents it 
when people around him find happiness, particularly Ranma and yourself. 
He sees it as a threat to his control over you.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Rei said, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. &quot;Then he must 
not find out about the status of the relationship between Ranma and 
myself.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Ritsuko nodded.

&quot;Very well, thank you for your assistance, Dr. Akagi,&quot; Rei said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;If these are the kind of goddamn geniuses that are supposed to save the 
planet, we&#39;re doomed,&quot; Ranma griped over the comm as she and Asuka 
walked through the city, naginata in hand to destroy the angel.

The techs in the control center developed a huge sweat-drop.

&quot;No kidding,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;I guess it&#39;s up to us to do the fighting and 
the thinking.&quot;

&quot;I suppose this is what happens when you put a bunch of engineers and 
scientists in charge of a battle,&quot; Ranma grumbled.

Fuyutsuki&#39;s eye began to twitch as Misato slapped her hand over her face 
in exasperation. Kaji stood beside Misato twiddling his thumbs and 
whistling innocently as if he had nothing to do with the plan the 
children were currently deriding.

&quot;Yup, you wave goodbye to elegant simplicity and get something stupidly 
complex with more features than you&#39;ll ever need to use,&quot; Asuka agreed 
as they arrived at the inert angel&#39;s location.

They each moved to one side of the angel and lined their progressive 
naginata up on the twin cores.

&quot;On one,&quot; Ranma announced. &quot;Three, two, one...&quot;

They plunged their naginata into the cores in perfect sync and the angel 
exploded in a massive blast. Two Eva&#39;s, one crimson with orange trim and 
one midnight-blue with bright green trim came striding out of the smoke 
and dust side by side, naginata resting on their shoulders.

&quot;And that, people, is how it should be done,&quot; Asuka declared. &quot;Simple 
and elegant.&quot;

&quot;Morons,&quot; Ranma said again, as Unit 01 shook its head as if in disgust.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Did you guys have to dress alike again?&quot; Toji whined as the six teens 
walked down the street. Ranma still owed Asuka some ice cream for 
getting the exercise right, so they were headed to the ice cream shop to 
celebrate the successful destruction of the angel.

The redheads turned their head in unison to Toji wearing identical 
smirks.

&quot;Of course,&quot; they said in weird stereo. &quot;It&#39;s fun!&quot;

Giggling, they turned back and walked on with a thoroughly creeped-out 
Toji, Hikari, and Kensuke trailing along behind them. After a few steps 
however, Ranma stiffened when both Rei and Asuka each grabbed one of her 
hands. Looking at the encouraging smiles each girl was giving her, she 
forced herself to relax and put a strained smile on her own face.

&quot;So Rei, are you gonna try the technique I taught ya today?&quot; Ranma asked 
the blue-haired girl.

&quot;I do not know,&quot; Rei said, looking down shyly as a cute blush stained 
her cheeks pink.

&quot;What technique?&quot; Asuka asked, curious.

&quot;The Anything Goes Uber-Cute Ice Cream Scamming Attack,&quot; Ranma said 
officiously, causing Asuka to giggle.

&quot;Do tell,&quot; Asuka grinned.

&quot;It&#39;s a most fearsome technique,&quot; Ranma said in a reverent tone. &quot;Its 
true horror is shrouded in mystery. Known only to a select few, it is 
feared by all food merchants who suddenly find their profit margin 
slashed after such an attack being made on them. You appear to be 
someone who could utilize this attack with as devastating an effect as 
myself. Would you like to learn this awesomely powerful technique, 
Student?&quot;

By now Asuka was giggling uncontrollably at the silly, officious tone 
Ranma was using as if she were about to pass on the secret to life, the 
universe, and everything.

&quot;Oh please, oh learned one, do not allow me to languish in ignorance. 
Bestow upon me your great wisdom,&quot; Asuka gasped back through her 
giggles.

Ranma snorted in laughter at Asuka&#39;s unwitting, but nevertheless, near 
perfect Kuno impression. She then proceeded to demonstrate the technique 
for the other redhead, who now had tears rolling down her cheeks from 
laughing so hard.

&quot;So, let me get this straight,&quot; Asuka chortled. &quot;The secret of this 
great all powerful technique is to flirt shamelessly with the counter 
attendant in hopes that he&#39;ll give you extra treats?&quot;

&quot;Harrumph,&quot; Ranma harrumphed imperiously. &quot;Obviously you don&#39;t 
understand the finer points of this technique.&quot;

&quot;I would say that Pilot Sohryu has a firm grasp of the theory behind the 
technique,&quot; Rei commented.

&quot;Etu, Brute?&quot; Ranma asked shooting Rei a look of mock-betrayal.

&quot;Might I presume to improve upon the technique, Sensei Variable-chan?&quot; 
Asuka snickered.

&quot;I&#39;m all ears,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I suggest we use the technique in tandem,&quot; Asuka suggested with a large 
grin. &quot;Using the fearsome twin factor, the effects should be magnified 
exponentially.&quot;

&quot;Ooo, very dangerous,&quot; Ranma cooed. &quot;Do you suppose it might be too much 
for the poor counter attendant?&quot;

&quot;Never know &#39;til we try, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka smirked.

&quot;Then by all means, let&#39;s,&quot; Ranma smirked back with a matching smirk. 
&quot;We&#39;ll try it in the name of the advancement of the art!&quot;

The redheads began to cackle maniacally, while the trailing trio 
developed huge sweat-drops and began to wonder if all Eva pilots were 
insane. Needless to say, it was not a good day to be in the ice cream 
business. The following day, the beleaguered owner of the shop began 
advertising for a gay counter boy in an effort to combat this dreaded 
threat to his profit margin.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma lay on his futon, stiff as a board. Misato was working late to 
take care of the paperwork from the battle and wasn&#39;t planning on coming 
home that night. Thus, the girls had insisted on him being in male form. 
On his right shoulder lay a head of blue hair, on his left a head of red 
hair. Both girls were snuggled tightly against him and Ranma was as 
nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.

Currently he was having an inner debate with himself. Though they had 
gone to sleep on their separate futons, Ranma had woken up sandwiched 
between the two girls every morning. While the aftermath was always 
stressful for him, he had to admit that he felt really nice until his 
conditioning kicked in, telling him to freak out. It had been the third 
morning before he began to believe they weren&#39;t planning on smashing his 
head open and painting abstract art on the walls with his brains.

Still, while he had made progress, he was nevertheless on the verge of 
panicking when he awoke to the girls cuddling him. Tonight they had 
decided to up the ante by going to sleep snuggling him. Ranma had to 
admit it was nice. He could smell the wonderful scent of their shampoo, 
and their soft, warm curves pressed against him made him feel incredibly 
tender towards them. But in the back of his mind, he still expected an 
uncute, man-hating, violent lunatic, wielding a mallet, to come bursting 
in to kill him for daring to feel pleasure in receiving female 
affection.

It would be a long time before he would relax enough to drift off to 
sleep.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;AN UNCUTE, MAN-HATING, VIOLENT, LUNATIC, AM I?&quot; Akane shrieked, 
actually frothing at the mouth. &quot;JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, 
YOU PERVERTED FREAK! HOW DARE YOU SAY I&#39;M VIOLENT!&quot;

It actually took both Shampoo and Ukyo to hold Akane back from smashing 
the TV long enough for Cologne to render her unconscious via a pressure 
point.

&quot;WHAAAAA,&quot; Soun wept. &quot;My baby girl has been pushed over the edge and is 
now a raving lunatic!&quot;

&quot;There, there, Tendo,&quot; Genma attempted to comfort his friend before Soun 
triggered his curse, which wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with casts on his 
limbs. &quot;The foolish, dishonorable boy doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking 
about.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, Uncle Saotome,&quot; Kasumi protested pleasantly. &quot;Akane is a 
violent maniac. I told Ranma that on the first day he was here.&quot;

Nodoka was torn. On the one hand, she was filled with a desire to whip 
out her victory fans and do her happy dance because her son was sleeping 
with two girls. On the other hand, she wanted to visit extreme amounts 
of violence on her husband for forcing Ranma into such an abusive 
relationship with a girl who was obviously undeserving of her manly son. 
Why couldn&#39;t any of the girls present be more like those on the TV, 
willing to share her son since he was obviously far too manly for just 
one woman.

One thing that she found particularly disturbing was Ranma&#39;s evident 
acceptance of his female form. He seemed to genuinely have fun as a girl 
with the other girls. That didn&#39;t seem very manly; especially the way he 
was spending a lot of time going around in female form and dressing like 
a girl. She would have to think on this.

&quot;We&#39;re losing him, Sugar,&quot; Ukyo said to Shampoo somberly.

Shampoo just nodded glumly.

&quot;You brainiacs don&#39;t get it do you?&quot; Nabiki snapped in exasperation. &quot;He 
was never yours to lose. You two and my little sister drove him away 
before he could ever develop any feelings for any of you beyond 
annoyance. Have you not been watching? Look at him. Aside from that 
little blip that you guys caused with him fearing intimacy, I&#39;ve never 
seen him as happy as he is there. Kami-sama, he&#39;s happier in a world 
where he&#39;s fighting for his life than he was here.&quot;

&quot;Hey, you had a hand in making his life miserable too, Sugar,&quot; Ukyo 
challenged.

&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Nabiki agreed. &quot;And I&#39;m now seeing things a little 
differently. I won&#39;t begrudge him what happiness he can get in that 
world. He deserves it.&quot;

In truth, Nabiki was seeing a side to Ranma that she never suspected to 
exist. He was using his head, proving he wasn&#39;t just the stupid jock 
everyone thought he was. Granted, he wasn&#39;t brilliant by any stretch, 
but the fact that he was thinking and planning instead of just reacting 
shocked Nabiki to no end.</pre>
