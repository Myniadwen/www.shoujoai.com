<a href="../eva/altdest-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>As the class prepared for their trip to Okinawa there
was much rejoicing... except for four students, all of
whom watched the giddy students with some annoyance.
Shinji Ikari sighed as the slim, black haired girl sat
back at her desk, &quot;Why do ALL of us have to stay?&quot; She
looked over at Asuka and smiled slyly, &quot;I bet you
could take on a Angel all alone.&quot;

Asuka gave him a look, the orange haired spitfire
clearly aware that agreeing or disagreeing might be a
trap. &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; she tossed her head, &quot;but NERV
has decided to have all it&#39;s pilots ready.&quot;

&quot;In case you need rescuing again?&quot; Rei wondered
softly, her light blue hair falling into her red eyes.

Asuka scowled at the pale girl, &quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;You too?&quot; Mana Kirishima asked, the redhead sitting
nearby as she ate her lunch. She had recovered fairly
quickly from the trouncing the Angel had given her and
Jet Alone, only still bearing a few scrapes and
bruises.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shinji agreed, &quot;we&#39;re all on alert just in
case.&quot;

Mana looked annoyed, &quot;Jet Alone hasn&#39;t even been
repaired and I&#39;m still being kept here.&quot; She pouted,
&quot;I wanna see Okinawa!&quot;

Asuka actually chuckled before recovering her poise.
&quot;Anyway, our duty requires us to stay here,&quot; she said
firmly, &quot;besides, I&#39;m sure Okinawa isn&#39;t THAT good.&quot;

Everyone other than Rei gave her a look. &quot;Sun, sand
and guys or girls in swimwear? Are you out of your
mind?&quot; Mana sighed.

&quot;We could always do it here.&quot; Rei noted mildly.

This time, everyone looked at Rei. &quot;You know,&quot; Mana
sighed, &quot;it&#39;s better if you have someone you want
to... attract there.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Rei nodded.

Later, after class Shinji, Asuka and Rei headed off,
walking together as they talked quietly. &quot;So how&#39;s the
suite NERV set up for you?&quot; Shinji asked Asuka,
curious as she&#39;d been tempted to look into such a
option herself.

&quot;Lousy,&quot; Asuka shrugged, &quot;there&#39;s no view, the
reception is bad, the internet is dial-up and my
nearest neighbor is her.&quot;

&quot;Rei?&quot; Shinji blinked.

&quot;We&#39;re not far from each other,&quot; Rei calmly noted,
&quot;and as the building is owned by NERV it was probably
convenient.&quot;

&quot;Not to me it&#39;s not,&quot; Asuka growled out as she
continued, &quot;as soon as possible I&#39;m looking into a
alternative.&quot;

Shinji looked at Rei and noted the slightest sign of
relief. &#39;Guess Asuka isn&#39;t that good of a neighbor,&#39;
she mused. As they reached her corner she nodded to
them and said, &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll see you at NERV
later.&quot;

Rei nodded as Asuka said, &quot;When we do, try not to get
in my way this time?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Shinji waved as she let Asuka&#39;s miss-aimed
barb slide off harmlessly. If anyone was to blame for
their thrashing at the hands of the latest Angel it
was Jet Alone, and even Asuka would have to concede
the things&#39; ability to split was unprecedented.

&quot;Oh yes, YES!&quot; Shinji heard a familiar voice cry as
she opened the door.

&#39;Oh no,&#39; she thought weakly as Shinji quietly slipped
her shoes off.

&quot;Harder, faster!&quot; Ritsuko shouted from the living
room.

&quot;You&#39;re doing great!&quot; Misato yelped.

Dreading what she was going to see Shinji quietly made
her way up the hall only to pause in surprise. Ritsuko
and Misato were sitting in front of the TV, playing a
older video game system Shinji had noticed was kept
under the television.

As they were about to start yelling again Shinji
calmly noted, &quot;If someone overheard they might get the
wrong idea.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re back Shin-chan,&quot; Misato said, the black
haired woman in a slinky black skirt not turning away
from the screen as she asked, &quot;could you be a dear and
get me a drink?&quot;

&quot;Misato,&quot; Ritsuko scolded, the dyed blonde also not
turning away from her gaming.

Shinji chuckled as she retrieved a beer and a soda and
set them by the correct parental figure. &quot;You two do
this often?&quot; she asked, watching as armored figures
shot at each other and the enemy on the screen.

Misato grinned as she used a rocket launcher, &quot;Every
few weeks we dig this out and blow things up... I
think it helps relieve the tension of working at
NERV.&quot;

&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Shinji conceded. After a
few hours of dealing with her father, she probably
would want to blow things up too.

After a final burst of explosions they finished,
MIsato bumping a fist in the air as she cackled
evilly. &quot;One of these days I&#39;ll get you,&quot; Ritsuko
grumbled.

&quot;Promises, promises,&quot; Misato winked at her lover
impishly.

Shinji cleared her throat as she asked, &quot;So, are we
eating dinner here or getting something up at the
base?&quot;

Reluctantly Ritsuko turned her attention to Shinji,
&quot;It&#39;s up to you, actually. I&#39;ve got Maya monitoring
some unusual readings in the mountains, but it&#39;s not
too urgent...&quot;

ring The phone interrupted Ritsuko midsentence.

&quot;Spoke too soon,&quot; Misato muttered as she picked it up,
&quot;Katsuragi residence. Yes, Maya, she&#39;s here...&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ritsuko muttered under her breath as she took
it then brightly said, &quot;Yes?&quot; She listened, a frown
appearing as she nodded slightly, &quot;All right,continue
to monitor the situation. We&#39;re coming in.&quot;

&quot;Angels?&quot; Shinji wondered as she followed them to the
door and hurriedly slipped her shoes on.

Ritsuko hopped a bit as she yanked her runners on, her
white lab coat fluttering, &quot;It&#39;s possible, but the
readings are... strange.&quot;

&quot;This is the volcano, right?&quot; MIsato asked as she
slung her usual jacket on.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Ritsuko nodded as they headed out to the sports
car Misato preferred, &quot;We picked up odd, almost
biological readings inside the mountain... and our
latest probes imply it may be a Angel.&quot;

&quot;Imply and might doesn&#39;t sound so sure,&quot; Shinji noted
as she climbed into the back seat.

Ritsuko didn&#39;t seem bothered by the question as she
belted in, &quot;The reading we&#39;ve been getting have been
odd, so much so we sent in a remote probe.&quot; She
sounded excited, &quot;I&#39;ll need to go over Maya&#39;s data,
but it could be a Angel egg!&quot;

&quot;So what do we do about it?&quot; Misato asked reasonably
as they peeled out and sped on the way to NERV.

&quot;Crack it before it hatches?&quot; Shinji suggested.

Ritsuko looked shocked, &quot;This could be a invaluable
opportunity for research!&quot;

Shinji shook her head, &quot;And it could try to kill us
all.&quot;

MIsato cleared her throat pointedly. &quot;It isn&#39;t a
decision that&#39;ll be made on our level anyway,&quot; she
reminded them both as they ripped across the city then
down through the tunnel access to NERV.

Not long after they split off, Ritsuko hurrying off to
run through the data as Misato and Shinji ordered
takeout to be delivered to NERV. &quot;It&#39;ll be about
twenty minutes,&quot; Shinji reported, putting down the
phone, &quot;I ordered extra for Rei and Asuka, just in
case.&quot;

&quot;Good thinking,&quot; Misato agreed as they walked to a
unoccupied meeting room Ritsuko had reserved, &quot;I
hadn&#39;t realized you were so fierce about the Angels,
Shinji.&quot;

Shinji paused, her school skirt swirling around her
legs as she looked up at Misato. &quot;Having them try to
kill me a few times,&quot; she said dryly, &quot;has kind of
influenced me a bit.&quot; With that she turned and walked
on.

Misato hurried after as she mused, &#39;I forget sometimes
how different it is for her. All of us are in danger
from the Angels, but Shinji and the other pilots face
a more immediate, personal danger than we do.&#39;

&quot;About time,&quot; Asuka looked up from where she had taken
a seat, her eyes more welcoming than her tone of
voice.

&quot;Welcome, Major,&quot; Rei addressed Misato but her gaze
landed on Shinji and stayed there, lingering
thoughtfully.

&quot;Dinner&#39;s on it&#39;s way thanks to Shinji,&quot; Misato said
briskly, &quot;and once Ritsuko finishes the data analysis
she&#39;ll brief Gendo then us.&quot;

&quot;What did you order?&quot; Asuna asked as Shinji took a
open seat spaced evenly between Rei and Asuka.

&quot;Chinese,&quot; Shinji said, &quot;they usually send extra in
case any of the staff wants some, too.&quot;

Asuna reluctantly said, &quot;I suppose so.&quot;

Misato watched with some amusement as Shinji attempted
to keep the peace between the two polar opposite girls
even as she included Misato. Thankfully Ritsuko
arrived not long after, the set of her shoulders
showing she was in her chief scientist mode.

&quot;We&#39;ve confirmed that the entity is a unborn Angel,&quot;
Ritsuko said briskly as she activated the monitor in
the room to show a cut away simulation of the
mountain&#39;s interior, &quot;and Commander Ikari has ordered
a retrieval mission.&quot;
