<a href="../eva/3gen-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;We&#39;re doing WHAT?&quot; Asuka blinked in surprise as she
and Rei caught up with Misato on another of their busy
days.

&quot;Unarmed combat training,&quot; Misato said cheerfully,
eyeing the orange haiered young woman thoughtfully,
&quot;we&#39;ll have the first session in a few days.&quot;

Asuka shook her head as she admitted, &quot;I&#39;m not quite
sure I get the point of that. The power we have in
Evangelion kind of makes those sort of skills
unnecessary.&quot;

&quot;Rei?&quot; Misato looked over at her curiously, wanting to
see how she would react.

The blue haired girl looked thoughtful, her red eyes
narrowed as she considered it. &quot;There is the
continuing possiblility that we may face one or more
rogue EVAs,&quot; she finally said, &quot;whom match us in
physical power.&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; Misato flashed a smile.

Asuka had a wry smile as she nodded too, &quot;Point.&quot;

Rei actually blushed slightly, looking down. &quot;Thank
you,&quot; she said softly, a slight smile tugging at her
lips.

The NERV complex around them was as busy as usual,
staff rushing about the underground complex beneath
the city. The motorized walkway that they were on was
rapidly carrying them right through the science
division towards personel, many of Ritsuko&#39;s staff
bustling about around them. Even farther below them
the construction of the new prototype Archangel system
was moving ahead, the work seeming to fire up the
place with a new energy.

&quot;So are we bringing someone new in to do the
training?&quot; Asuka asked, her long black pants swishing
slightly as she moved. Beside her Rei was dressed in
her usual girl&#39;s uniform, the two of them making a
unique sort of couple.

&quot;New,&quot; Misato agreed, &quot;she&#39;s already a NERV employee,
but with the defensive corps rather than our staff
here.&quot; She hesitated a few seconds, &quot;Dr. Mizuno is
here today to examine Yui and she also wanted the
chance to look you over, Asuka.&quot;

Asuka had a very wary look in her eye, her black
eyepatch especially bold on her pale face as she
asked, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Your eye,&quot; Misato admitted just a bit sheepishly, &quot;I
was hoping that a second opinion might help. Mizuno&#39;s
worked on neurology as well as general medicne...&quot;

Asuka was faintly surprised to see a faint bit of
guilt in Misato&#39;s eyes and sighed. She had told Misato
that her injuries weren&#39;t the other woman&#39;s
responsibility, but it obviously hadn&#39;t sunk in. &quot;All
right,&quot; she conceded, &quot;I&#39;ll go.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato grinned. They passed through one of
the armor sections that protected the underground base
from any surface attacks as she continued, &quot;I won&#39;t be
home till late, can you order out some dinner?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Rei said mildly.

Asuka looked at Misato curiously, &quot;Working late?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Misato actually reddened slightly, &quot;I
have a date.&quot;

Asuka and Rei both looked up at her in surprise.
Suspiciously Asuka asked, &quot;Ritsuko and Maya didn&#39;t
talk you into a threesome or something, did they?&quot;

Misato blinked at Asuka in shock, &quot;Where did you get
THAT idea?&quot;

Asuka blushed slightly under both Misato and Rei&#39;s
looks, &quot;What, I remember our little trip to the
hotsprings, Misato.&quot; A faint blush, &quot;You two weren&#39;t
exactly silent.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Rei looked at Asuka curiously.

Misato&#39;s face was beet red, literally, at the memories
Asuka&#39;s comment had stirred up. &quot;No, they didn&#39;t,&quot; she
said with as much dignity as possible, &quot;in fact it&#39;s
your new trainer.&quot;

&quot;Is he cute?&quot; Rei asked in a slightly detached way.

Misato was moving off as she answered, &quot;Yes, she is.&quot;

Later on that day Asuka sat rather uncomfortably on a
table as Dr. Ami Mizuno shone a light into her good
eye and then into her nearly blind one. &quot;Do you see
anything?&quot; Ami asked, the blue haired woman&#39;s hand
gentle as she steadied Asuka&#39;s head.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Asuka admitted.

Ami put the light down, sitting by Asuka as she
studied her thoughtfully. The doctor seemed young for
her age, maybe in her twenties, and there was a
gentleness in her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re presenting us with
quite a puzzle,&quot; she finally said.

&quot;As much as Yui?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Nearly,&quot; Ami chuckled softly.

Asuka took a nervous breath, &quot;So what&#39;s the
prognosis?&quot;

Ami picked up a report, her expression grave. &quot;As you
know both catscans and neurological exams were given
after you were found unconscious with Shinji, and when
you began to show signs of blindness,&quot; she said.

&quot;And?&quot; Asuka asked with a touch of impatience.

&quot;We haven&#39;t been able to find a physical cause for
your injury,&quot; Ami finished.

Asuka looked at her blankly a few moments, trying to
think about it a bit before blurting out something.
&quot;So what&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Talking with Ritsuko and Yui we&#39;ve devised a working
theory,&quot; Ami said gently, &quot;your EVA was stabbed
through the same eye in your battle with the mas
production EVAs, correct?&quot;

Asuka winced in memory of the agony she had felt then,
the event that had lead into the swarming and
destruction of her EVA. Voice a bit choked she
answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;It seems that the feedback from the EVA to your brain
was so strong that it literally convinced you that you
were blind in that eye,&quot; Ami explained.

Asuka reached up, fingers gently resting against the
black cloth as she quietly asked, &quot;So how do we fix
this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ami said honestly, &quot;this isn&#39;t a
simple situation. It&#39;s as much psychological as
neurological, and it may not... be treatable.&quot;

Asuka closed her eye, taking a deep breath. &quot;All
right,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I was really
expecting anything else.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass the information on to your staff doctors,&quot;
Ami said, &quot;and Ritsuko seems especially eager to help
tackle the problem.&quot;

&quot;Misplaced guilt it a wonderful motivator,&quot; Asuka
noted as they went out into the hall, Rei looking up
with a happy smile from where she waited.

&quot;That it is,&quot; Ami agreed, noting with some amusement
how Rei simply enfolded the startled Asuka in a hug.
&quot;I&#39;ll inform Misato when I give her the report on
Yui,&quot; she said as she left, deciding to leave the
girls alone.

&quot;How are you?&quot; Rei asked, keeping a firmhold on Asuka.

&quot;They&#39;ree not sure what&#39;s wrong with my eye,&quot; Asuka
was surprised to find herself giving it a hopefull
spin, &quot;but they don&#39;t thik there&#39;s any physical
damage.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Rei hugged her gently.

The two walked by a hospital window, the sun outside
begining to set behind the towers of Megatokyo. &quot;I
wonder if Misato&#39;s date has started yet?&quot; Asuka
wondered.

Across town Misato nervously checked her watch, the
little red dress she was wearing hugging her form. She
couldn&#39;t believe she was out here, honestly, waiting
around for a date to come by and pick her up. Still,
since she had first interviewed the woman a few days
ago Misato hadn&#39;t been able to get that handsome face
out of her mind...

The black european sportscar swung around the corner
gracefully before sliding to a stop. The drivers side
swung open as she got out, her short black hair styled
in a boyish way, the crisp black suit hugging her slim
form. She smiled warmly, brown eyes twinkling as she
said, &quot;I hope you weren&#39;t waiting long, Ms.
Katsuragi.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Misato, please,&quot; she answered, &quot;and can I call
you Aoba?&quot;

Aoba Kinushima chuckled softlly as she opened the door
for Misato, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;

&#39;Gentlemanly, too,&#39; Misato thought in pleasure, &#39;I
think I&#39;m going to enjoy tonight.&#39;

To be continued...

Note: Aoba Kinushima is a character from the manga
Maniac Road, and like most of the other EVA characters
was named after a ship. I&#39;d recomet the manga for the
comedy value, as well ass the running joke involving
Aoba being a bit of a babe magnet.</pre>
