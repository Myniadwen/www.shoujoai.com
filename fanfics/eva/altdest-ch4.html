<h1>Altered Destinies (part 4 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Shinji Ikari stepped out, the black haired young woman
looking visibly nervous as she said, &quot;And pilots
regularly wear this?&quot; The blue and black plugsuit
hugged her slim body from head to toe, making it quite
clear that Shinji was a girl.

Ritsuko Akagi smiled to herself slightly, the blonde
haired scientist looking faintly amused. &quot;If it makes
you feel any better,&quot; she explained, &quot;the plugsuit
needs to be skintight to help conduct your thoughts
and nerve impulses to the EVA.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Shinji was blushing faintly as she walked
around the small changing room, trying to get more
comfortable in the unusual clothes. She reached up to
touch the two blue devices on her head, almost looking
like cat&#39;s ears, and added, &quot;I&#39;m going to look
ridiculous.&quot;

Ritsuko&#39;s lips twitched, but she didn&#39;t let herself
react. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said instead, &quot;I think Misato
wanted to see how you looked.&quot; The white labcoat she
wore over the standard gray NERV uniform looked good
on her, though she didn&#39;t draw as many glances as
Shinji.

&quot;Right,&quot; Shinji sighed softly, the two of them leaving
the lab where Shinji had been fitted with the new set
of clothes.

&#39;Shinji seems less stubborn around me or Misato,&#39;
Ritsuko found herself thinking about what had happened
earlier, &#39;but she&#39;s remarkably stiff necked where
Gendo is concerned.&#39; The two of them had barely talked
during their walk down the hall together, just
ignoring each other while Ritsuko had tried her best
to make conversation.

Misato Katsuragi looked up, her eyes lighting up as
she saw Ritsuko and the blonde scientist smiled back.
The black haired officer shifted her glance to Shinji
and grinned, &quot;Well, at least I won&#39;t be mistaking you
for a boy in that.&quot;

Shinji went beet red at that. &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; she
sighed.

Misato got out of her chair by Ritsuko&#39;s desk to give
Shinji a good look as she said, &quot;You certainly look
batter in one of those things than Ritsuko did.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Shinji blinked.

&quot;Misato!&quot; Ritsuko blurted.

Misato looked like she was fighting back a chuckle as
she explained, &quot;Ritsuko had to wear a plugsuit during
the testing stages, it was pretty funny...&quot;

A blushing Ritsuko walked over and firmly put her hand
over Misato&#39;s mouth. &quot;Love, she does not need to hear
about that,&quot; she said firmly.

Shinji couldn&#39;t help but smile at that comment. There
was a soft sound from the doorway and Shinji looked up
to meet the most startling red eye. Rei Ayanami stood
in the office doorway studying them thoughtfully, her
expression oddly unreadable. Bandages still covered
part of her face, her arm was in a sling, but there
was an odd feeling of strength in her.

&quot;Dr. Akagi,&quot; Rei said in her cool tones, her
schoolgirl&#39;s uniform fluttering slightly from the
air-conditioning, &quot;the Commander asked to see you.&quot;

Ritsuko made a face, &quot;Probably wants Unit-00
reactivated as soon as possible.&quot; She walked over to
the door as she added, &quot;Misato, can you get Shinji
back home? This might take awhile.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Misato nodded.

Rei was about to leave as silently as she came when
Shinji spoke up, &quot;Ayanami-san?&quot;

Turning back to look at Shinji Rei asked, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Shinji hesitated under her gaze then took a breath,
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you feeling better.&quot;

Rei stood there a moment, almost as if she was
surprised by what Shinji said then quietly answered,
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Without another word she was gone.

Shinji blinked a few times once Rei was gone, her
expression mildly confused. &quot;Is Ayanami always like
that?&quot; she finally asked.

Misato smiled from where she was leaning up against
Ritsuko&#39;s desk, &quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot; She pushed off and
ran a hand through her hair, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you
changed back into street clothes, we&#39;ve got other
errands to get done.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Shinji said, clearly relieved to soon be out
of the tight plugsuit.

&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; Misato chuckled. Soon Shinji
was changed and sitting in the passenger side on
Misato&#39;s latest car, another sleek sports model.

Shinji made an odd squeaking noise as she grabbed the
dashboard, the car squealing through a tight turn. &quot;So
where to next?&quot; she asked, keeping her eyes partially
shut.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to finish registering you for school,&quot;
Misato answered her as she casually kept an eye on the
road, &quot;do you want to come along?&quot;

Shinji nodded slightly, body stiff from fear as she
admitted, &quot;I guess it would be a good idea to take a
look around.&quot; Her red shirt and black skirt weren&#39;t
too stylish, but Shinji wasn&#39;t too worried about
making a splash anyway. &#39;Besides, compared to Misato I
couldn&#39;t,&#39; she admitted.

Misato was wearing a little black dress that was just
this side of sinful, high on the thigh and with a
plunging neckline. Along with her red jacket she made
quite a image, an almost deliberate sort of sexiness
that Shinji almost envied.

&quot;What?&quot; Misato looked at her curiously, &quot;I don&#39;t have
something on my face, do I?&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Shinji shook her head, smiling wryly.

Misato turned back to the road, her lips curling up
slightly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said confidently as they
finally reached the school, &quot;you&#39;ll fill out
eventually.&quot;

Shinji felt her face go red again, but decided to keep
her mouth shut as they screeched to a stop in the
parking lot. Misato bounced out confidently as Shinji
was peeling her cramped fingers from the dashboard,
sighing in relief that they were finally there.

&quot;I&#39;ll be inside dealing with paperwork,&quot; Misato said
as she cheerfully waved to the young men and women who
were staring out the windows at them, &quot;take a look
around and see what you think.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Shinji sighed, watching her stride off.

Leaning back from where the brown haired young man had
nearly been hanging out the window watching Misato
Toji shook his head, &quot;God that woman is a babe.&quot;

&quot;Out of our league,&quot; the blonde haired boy sighed.

&quot;Aida, Toji,&quot; Hikari scolded them both, &quot;pay
attention.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that girl is heading towards the building,&quot; Aida
noted, adjusting his glasses.

&quot;Think she&#39;s a new transfer?&quot; Toji asked as they
reluctantly turned away.

&quot;That would be kind of strange,&quot; Hikari conceded,
&quot;most people are moving away after that last attack,
not coming here.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Aida brightened, &quot;maybe she&#39;s the pilot of that
giant robot!&quot;


&quot;There&#39;s no way that they&#39;d ever put a kid into a
giant robot,&quot; Toji loudly scoffed, but he did sound
thoughtful.

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Aida protested, &quot;you know it&#39;s been an
open secret about Ayanami.&quot;

&quot;Ayanami isn&#39;t...,&quot; Hikari hesitated before letting
herself say, &quot;exactly normal. This new girl looks
pretty average.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Toji nodded slightly, &quot;but if she is the
pilot... I owe her.&quot;

Aida smiled to himself slightly, taking another peek
at the girl who was standing out front looking
nervously at the buildings, &quot;You know, she is sort of
cute.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;d better hope that she&#39;s a military otaku,&quot;
Hikari muttered, &quot;or you&#39;re going to have no chance
with her.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Aida protested.

Toji smiled slightly, &quot;She&#39;s got a point.&quot;

&quot;Oh, big help you are,&quot; Aida muttered.

There was a loud clearing of a throat from the front
of the classroom and all three looked up guiltily to
see the teacher regarding them wearily. &quot;Toji and Aida
I can understand,&quot; he said with a dramatic sigh, &quot;but
Hikari too?&quot;

&quot;Busted,&quot; Toji whispered with a smirk.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Hikari hissed back.
