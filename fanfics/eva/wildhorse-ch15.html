<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 15 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/wildhorse-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;Elder, may I have a word with you in private?&quot; Nodoka asked Cologne.

&quot;Of course, Dear,&quot; Cologne agreed.

The two elder women moved to the dojo. Nodoka assumed seiza position and 
Cologne seated herself opposite the maroon-haired woman.

&quot;What is it you wished to speak of, Dear?&quot; Cologne asked.

&quot;Elder, do you think I&#39;m a bad mother because I expect my son to live up 
to my expectations?&quot; Nodoka asked.

Cologne sat thoughtfully for several minutes before answering.

&quot;Do you wish for my honest opinion?&quot; Nodoka nodded so Cologne continued. 
&quot;As mothers, we often have to do things that are hurtful to our 
children. I didn&#39;t like having to give Xian Pu her curse, but the law 
was clear. She failed in her duty as an Amazon warrior and had to be 
penalized. She also needed to learn a lesson about her pride. You see, 
she need not have given Ranma&#39;s girl-form the Kiss of Death.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Nodoka said.

&quot;The match was fairly fought over food Ranma and his father had eaten by 
mistake. Yet her pride wouldn&#39;t let her accept being humbled by an 
outsider in front of the whole village, even though she had just won the 
tournament,&quot; Cologne explained. &quot;She rashly vowed to hunt down and kill 
someone with far more skill than she possessed and not surprisingly, she 
failed. She is just fortunate that Ranma is a kind person. Most people 
would have met lethal force with lethal force, but Ranma just avoided 
her or incapacitated her long enough to get away.&quot;

&quot;What has this to do with me and my son?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;I was merely illustrating that sometimes we must hurt our children so 
that they will learn a lesson,&quot; Cologne said. &quot;Xian Pu knowingly invoked 
the tribal law and she was expected to deal with the consequences.&quot;

&quot;So you feel I am justified in enforcing the contract my son signed?&quot; 
Nodoka asked.

&quot;Not in the least,&quot; Cologne said, a hint of disgust tainting her tone. 
&quot;First of all, Ranma was six years old and couldn&#39;t even write, much 
less read and understand what was in that contract. Nor could he 
appreciate the consequences of failure. The fact is Ranma never even 
signed it. As you heard, his father told him he was finger painting. No 
self-respecting mother would call for their child&#39;s life just because 
they didn&#39;t turn out the way the mother wanted. It is a mother&#39;s duty to 
protect their children, not judge them. You have failed thus far in the 
first and set yourself up for the second.&quot;

&quot;I-I see,&quot; Nodoka said, looking down in shame.

&quot;Forgive my bluntness,&quot; Cologne said, &quot;but you have allowed yourself to 
be manipulated by that miserable waste of a male you call a husband. It 
was his goal to alienate you from Ranma and he succeeded marvelously in 
that.&quot;

&quot;Why would Genma do such a thing?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;You heard him,&quot; Cologne spat. &quot;He considers women to be weak and 
inferior. He wanted to stamp out Ranma&#39;s softer side and getting him 
away from you was the first step. He also thought that you would 
interfere with his plans for Ranma.&quot;

&quot;I always let Genma control Ranma&#39;s training,&quot; Nodoka denied.

&quot;Tell me, had you been there, would you have allowed him to subject 
Ranma to the Nekoken?&quot; Cologne asked.

&quot;Certainly not!&quot; Nodoka said emphatically, then paused. &quot;I see what you 
mean. Then it&#39;s true. I&#39;m a failure as a mother?&quot;

&quot;You made a mistake,&quot; Cologne said. &quot;A mistake you have been paying for, 
for the last eleven years. IF Ranma returns to us, you now have an 
opportunity to be his mother and make things right. Do not think Ranma 
has been hiding from you because he fears for his life like his 
miserable coward of a father. Ranma hides from you because he 
desperately doesn&#39;t want to disappoint you.&quot;

Nodoka sat silently with her eyes closed as a tear squeezed out from 
beneath the tightly closed lids.

&quot;Come, Dear, let&#39;s go watch more of your son&#39;s adventures,&quot; Cologne said 
gently.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma woke up purring as she felt herself being gently stroked. Her eyes 
slowly opened to Rei propped up on one elbow slowly caressing her.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Ranma purred languidly.

&quot;You know of my true nature and my part in the Commander&#39;s plan, don&#39;t 
you?&quot; Rei asked softly.

&quot;I know, and it doesn&#39;t make any difference to me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I love 
you, Rei. And I meant what I said when I said you&#39;re irreplaceable. I 
don&#39;t care if they do have a tank full of copies of you, seeing you die 
would hurt.&quot;

Rei paused in her stroking and blinked her now glistening eyes several 
times.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said softly. &quot;But what of my purpose in the Commander&#39;s 
plan?&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t allow him to use you like that,&quot; Ranma vowed, placing a gentle 
hand on Rei&#39;s cheek. &quot;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to ensure that you and 
Asuka live through this. If I get to stay afterward, then we can be 
happy together. If I&#39;m forced to go back, then at least I&#39;ll know you 
are both alive.&quot;

Rei closed her eyes and nuzzled into Ranma&#39;s hand. Rei&#39;s hand, which was 
resting on Ranma&#39;s smooth, taut belly, was joined by another, fingers 
intertwining with hers.

&quot;Let&#39;s just hope you get to stay, Liebling,&quot; Asuka said groggily from 
where she was cuddled up to Ranma&#39;s other side. &quot;I don&#39;t fancy living 
without either of you.&quot;

The three of them laid there for a while longer, basking in the warmth 
of their mutual affection.

&quot;Ugh,&quot; Asuka commented. &quot;I feel awful.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Koi?&quot; Ranma asked her with concern.

&quot;I just feel sick, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;My back is sore and my 
stomach feels a little queasy.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, well, we have a sync test later today,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;Maybe we 
can get Dr. Akagi to check you out. Speaking of which, we need to get 
going. I hope you both were keeping up on your training while I was 
gone.&quot;

Both girls nodded.

&quot;Good,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;ll go get started on breakfast if you two want 
the furoba first.&quot;

&quot;That would be acceptable,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Let me go brush my teeth and stuff first then,&quot; Ranma said, giving each 
girl a gentle kiss on the forehead before untangling herself and heading 
to the bathroom.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ranma cursed as she lowered herself into the furo and didn&#39;t 
change. &quot;I hate it when this happens.&quot;

Sighing, she settled in to soak in the hot water, closing her eyes and 
relaxing. Suddenly, her eyes popped open wide as something occurred to 
her. A weak smile appeared on her face.

&quot;I guess it had to happen sooner or later,&quot; Ranma said to herself. 
&quot;Things are bound to get ugly though.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Asuka-chan?&quot; Ranma said, entering the room where Asuka was laying on 
the couch looking miserable.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Asuka prompted.

&quot;Here, take these,&quot; Ranma said, handing her a couple of pills and a 
glass of water. &quot;They&#39;ll help you feel better.&quot;

Asuka sat up and accepted the offering. She shot Ranma a weak smile of 
thanks and put the pills in her mouth, washing them down with the water.

&quot;There&#39;s something I need to give you, Koi,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Come with me, 
please.&quot;

Ranma offered her hand to Asuka and pulled her to her feet before 
leading her to the bathroom.

&quot;You&#39;ll want to carry these with you when we leave,&quot; Ranma said, handing 
her a few items.

Asuka blinked at the other redhead in confusion after she saw what the 
items Ranma handed her were.

&quot;This is embarrassing and I&#39;m really sorry, but I have to ask, do you 
know how to use them?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I-I-I,&quot; Asuka stammered, blushing. Ranma sighed.

&quot;Believe me, Koi, this is one discussion that I never thought I&#39;d be on 
either end of,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;If you want, you can have Dr. Akagi explain 
things.&quot;

&quot;N-no,&quot; Asuka said hesitantly. &quot;I&#39;d rather you explained it to me.&quot;

Ranma nodded and steeled herself.

&quot;The flat thin items are panty shields,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I usually use them 
until I start spotting. After that, I switch to the tampons. Those are 
all I have so if you&#39;d rather use sanitary napkins, you&#39;ll have to get 
your own. The tampons work better for me as a martial artist. I don&#39;t 
have to worry about them moving out of position and they&#39;re less obvious 
than the napkins.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Asuka said, blushing madly.

Ranma went on to explain how to insert the tampons, demonstrating on 
herself as Asuka watched closely. After that, Ranma explained how to 
properly dispose of the used items, cautioning Asuka that flushing them 
down the toilet could cause the toilet to become plugged up. The whole 
experience was mortifying for both girls.

When the deeply blushing girls came out of the bathroom, Rei was looking 
at them curiously. Asuka began giggling as a thought popped into her 
head.

&quot;Just think, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka giggled. &quot;You may have to go through 
that whole explanation again with Rei soon.&quot;

Ranma paled causing Asuka to giggle harder.

&quot;By the way,&quot; Asuka asked as she recovered from her giggle fit. &quot;How did 
you know?&quot;

&quot;I...um...didn&#39;t at first, until I got in the furo and didn&#39;t change,&quot; 
Ranma explained. &quot;Kasumi told me that when women live in close proximity 
together their cycles will sync up. It suddenly occurred to me what was 
happening when I remembered the symptoms you were complaining about. And 
there was something else.&quot;

Asuka looked at the madly blushing Ranma in question.

&quot;Well?&quot; the German redhead prompted.

&quot;Well, you remember how I mentioned my sense of smell is much more 
sensitive now?&quot; Ranma said in embarrassment.

&quot;Are you saying you could smell it?&quot; Asuka demanded, mortified.

&quot;Well, at first I thought it was just from last night, but then I could 
still pick it up after you got out of the furo,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;I&#39;m 
not saying ya stink or anything. You just smell a little different from 
normal.&quot;

&quot;You know, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka said darkly, &quot;if you didn&#39;t go through 
this too, that would be so embarrassing.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ranma said apologetically. &quot;Don&#39;t worry though. 
We&#39;ll get you your own bottle of Midol and a nice hot water bottle on 
the way home. Then I&#39;ll show you some utterly divine massage techniques 
that Kasumi taught me that will make you feel almost normal.&quot;

&quot;What are you two discussing?&quot; Rei asked innocently.

&quot;I&#39;m having my first period, Rei-chan,&quot; Asuka said proudly.

&quot;Perhaps, I too can learn the massage techniques so I can be of 
assistance to both of you,&quot; Rei suggested.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I don&#39;t understand it,&quot; Ritsuko said shaking her head.

&quot;Understand what?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Asuka&#39;s sync ratio is still falling,&quot; Ritsuko explained. &quot;It started to 
drop when Ranma was trapped in the Eva, but I thought it would be back 
up now that he&#39;s back.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s her period,&quot; Misato said.

&quot;Ranma&#39;s doesn&#39;t drop that far when she has hers,&quot; Ritsuko argued. 
&quot;She&#39;s having hers at the moment as well and it still hasn&#39;t fallen more 
than 5 points.&quot;

&quot;Well, it is her first period,&quot; Misato said. &quot;You know how stressful 
your first period can be. What&#39;s worse is Ranma had to explain what was 
happening to her and show her what to do. It&#39;s gotta be completely 
embarrassing for your boyfriend to have to explain to you how to use a 
tampon.&quot;

Ritsuko burst out laughing.

&quot;Oh my god, poor Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko laughed. &quot;I bet they were both red as 
lobsters!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; Misato snickered. &quot;Okay, maybe a little funny, but I 
bet that&#39;s why her sync rate is down.&quot;

&quot;So what are the standings?&quot; Asuka demanded over the intercom from her 
entry plug. &quot;Have I caught up to Variable-chan yet?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Asuka,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;You&#39;ve actually fallen behind. Rei is 
nearly up to Ranma&#39;s ratio thanks to Ranma losing a few points due to 
her menses.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Asuka shrieked. &quot;I can&#39;t be in last place! I just can&#39;t!&quot;

The German redhead began cursing in German and pounding her instrument 
panel angrily. Ritsuko looked over at Misato.

&quot;Nice one, Ritsuko,&quot; Misato said dryly. &quot;Way to induce a mood-swing.&quot;

Ritsuko blinked sheepishly.

&quot;Asuka, you&#39;re just under a lot of stress right now,&quot; Ritsuko tried to 
reassure the grouchy girl. &quot;You&#39;ll be better in a few days.&quot;

&quot;But Variable-chan doesn&#39;t drop that far,&quot; Asuka whined. &quot;It&#39;s not 
fair!&quot;

&quot;Ranma has been having hers for a while now,&quot; Ritsuko explained. &quot;The 
first time is always hard. Once you get used to it you won&#39;t drop any 
more than Ranma&#39;s does.&quot;

Asuka seemed mollified but she continued to mutter curses in German.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Dr. Akagi?&quot; Rei asked dispassionately.

&quot;Yes, what is it Rei?&quot; Ritsuko prompted, looking up from her paperwork.

&quot;Will I also begin my menses soon?&quot; the blue-haired girl asked softly.

&quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know, Rei,&quot; Ritsuko answered. &quot;You have all the 
correct equipment so it is possible. Only time will tell.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Will I be able to bear children?&quot;

&quot;Um...as I said, you have all the correct parts to get pregnant, but I 
wouldn&#39;t recommend taking the chance,&quot; Ritsuko said carefully. &quot;It would 
be difficult to explain to Commander Ikari how that happened and...&quot; 
Ritsuko trailed off, not wanting to finish that thought.

&quot;He would most likely have me removed and activate the third,&quot; Rei 
finished for her in the same tone one might use when discussing the 
weather.

Ritsuko just looked away and nodded.

&quot;I understand,&quot; Rei stated.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Where&#39;s Rei-chan?&quot; Asuka said as she moaned in pleasure under Ranma&#39;s 
skilled hands. &quot;I thought she wanted to learn how to do this?&quot;

&quot;She stayed to talk to Ritsuko,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;I guess she should be 
home in a while.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm, that feels good,&quot; Asuka purred.

&quot;Yeah, I always thought so too when Kasumi did it for me,&quot; Ranma agreed. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t get it very often though. If Akane had saw Kasumi doing it, I 
would have got malleted to the moon for being a pervert with her 
sister.&quot;

&quot;Mein gott, how did you put up with her?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Everything is training, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma giggled. &quot;Thanks to Akane 
and that mallet of hers, I&#39;m able to take one heck of a beating without 
it slowing me down. Of course I know now that I shouldn&#39;t have let it 
happen. While I was using it as training, I was also training her that 
it was alright to take her anger out on me by hitting me. Enabling her, 
is what I think Ritsuko called it.&quot;

&quot;And you were also being conditioned to fear affection,&quot; Asuka pointed 
out.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma agreed sadly. &quot;I don&#39;t anymore though.&quot;

Ranma leaned down and kissed Asuka on the back of her neck. Asuka moaned 
happily.

&quot;I love you, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka purred.

&quot;I love you too, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma said tenderly.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei stood before the tanks containing numerous copies of her. The 
blue-haired girl was deep in thought considering what she had come here 
for. On the one hand, if she carried out what she was planning, she 
could be in grave trouble. On the other hand, with numerous copies of 
herself, the Commander could have her removed if he discovered her 
relationship with Ranma and her change of loyalty.

The fact was, after the Commander nearly caused her to lose Ranma with 
his cruel act of inducing the Nekoken, Rei had begun to despise Gendo 
Ikari. She had, she decided, very little choice if she wanted some sort 
of insurance that she wouldn&#39;t be replaced.

Going over to the control panel, she depressed a button.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she whispered to her copies as they began to dissolve in 
the tanks.

Covering her tracks, she quickly left the room and made her way out of 
the facility. When they discovered what she had done, they would find 
that the only person that had been in that room was Sub-commander 
Fuyutsuki. Dr. Akagi might be able to detect her tampering, but Rei was 
now convinced that Dr. Akagi would say nothing.

Rei now truly was irreplaceable, just like her beloved said.

(oO\O/Oo)

As luck would have it, a day later, Kozo Fuyutsuki vanished. The truth 
was he was kidnapped by SEELE so that they could interrogate him, but 
given the fact that the Rei clones had been destroyed and the security 
logins placed him on the scene, the situation looked really bad for him.

It also worked out perfectly for Kaji, who was still playing the part of 
SEELE&#39;s inside man, in spite of the fact that NERV was aware of his 
supposed allegiance to the shadowy cabal. It was the perfect cover for 
his operation to abduct Fuyutsuki. He wouldn&#39;t even be suspected.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei entered the apartment and immediately hugged Ranma tightly, burying 
her face in the part-time redhead&#39;s shoulder. Ranma could tell that the 
blue-haired girl was obviously upset and held her close while giving 
Asuka a confused look.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei-chan?&quot; Ranma asked with concern.

&quot;I destroyed them,&quot; Rei said, sadness tainting her voice. &quot;I truly am 
irreplaceable now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rei-chan,&quot; Ranma said compassionately. &quot;I know that must 
have been terrible for you.&quot;

&quot;I felt...most unpleasant,&quot; Rei said. &quot;I felt as if I were killing 
myself.&quot;

&quot;I understand, Rei-chan,&quot; Ranma said comfortingly. &quot;At least you&#39;re safe 
now. That bastard Gendo can&#39;t just recycle you if he feels the need. Not 
that I&#39;d let him anyway.&quot;

&quot;What are you guys talking about?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Rei-chan, do you want to tell her?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;It&#39;s up to you.&quot;

Rei nodded against Ranma&#39;s shoulder. Ranma sighed and sat down holding 
Rei in her lap. She began to explain Rei&#39;s nature and Gendo&#39;s plan to 
Asuka.

&quot;You mean she&#39;s part angel?&quot; Asuka exclaimed in shock.

&quot;And I&#39;m part girl. So what?&quot; Ranma countered. &quot;She&#39;s still the same 
person that we came to love. And it doesn&#39;t change the fact that she 
loves us and has been there for us when we needed her.&quot;

&quot;I guess that does explain some things about how she was raised,&quot; Asuka 
conceded.

Asuka looked at Rei who was now trembling slightly in Ranma&#39;s embrace. 
Her thoughts spun crazily as she thought about the revelations of the 
past couple of days. They had seriously shaken her worldview. Coupled 
with the fact that her hormones were going nuts from her period, Asuka 
felt desperately off balance.

Suddenly, it hit her as she watched Ranma comforting Rei tenderly. Ranma 
was her pillar. It didn&#39;t matter if she was off balance. She could cling 
to him for support. Thinking back to the two times Ranma had been lost 
to them, she realized that Rei was also a source of support for her. 
Nothing else really mattered.

Asuka slowly stood and moved over to the pair. Hesitantly, she put her 
arms around them and held on to them tightly.

&quot;I-I feel so lost,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;Like I&#39;m in over my head. But I know in 
my heart I can trust both of you. I&#39;m not giving either of you up. You 
can both count on me.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Kozo Fuyutsuki sat in the cell they had thrown him in following his 
interrogation by SEELE, his arms secured behind him to the chair-back he 
was sitting in. SEELE was clearly worried about Gendo Ikari&#39;s loyalty, 
as well they should be, and they had obviously brought him here to try 
and figure out what the man was planning.

Fuyutsuki would hold out giving them anything important for as long as 
he could, but he knew that things would get worse before they got 
better. SEELE wasn&#39;t a group that was bothered by human rights, nor did 
they constrain themselves to human methods. In the end, he knew he would 
break. He just hoped he could buy Ikari enough time to implement his 
plan.

He turned to look over his shoulder when the door to his dark cell 
opened.

&quot;You,&quot; Fuyutsuki said.

&quot;Yes, me,&quot; Kaji drawled. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to have to come with 
me, Sub-commander.&quot;

Kaji squatted down to unfasten Fuyutsuki&#39;s hands.

&quot;You know what you&#39;re doing,&quot; Fuyutsuki stated. &quot;They will kill you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I imagine so,&quot; Kaji said in a causal tone. &quot;But at least I&#39;ll have 
company. Gendo Ikari believes you&#39;ve betrayed him. He has Section 2 out 
hunting you with termination orders. So while SEELE will be hunting me, 
NERV will be hunting you. Fortunately for you, my employers want to meet 
you.&quot;

&quot;Your employers?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked. &quot;I thought you worked for SEELE?&quot;

&quot;All in good time, Sub-Commander, all in good time,&quot; Kaji said 
pleasantly as he completed releasing Fuyutsuki&#39;s bindings.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;It&#39;s just sitting there, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Hyuga reported. &quot;It&#39;s floating in 
orbit just out of our range.&quot;

&quot;What? Is it looking for a nice soft place to land?&quot; Misato asked 
sarcastically as she looked at the glowing object that resembled a stag 
horn fern painted glowing white. &quot;What&#39;s it waiting for?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Hyuga answered.

&quot;Fine, Asuka, I want you to take the point,&quot; Misato ordered. &quot;When the 
angel gets close enough, take the shot. Rei, I want you to back her up.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; the two girls said.

&quot;What about me, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Sorry, Ranma,&quot; Misato said. &quot;You&#39;re sitting this one out. Unit 01 is to 
remain in cryo-stasis until further notice.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma said glumly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka said cheerfully. &quot;We got this one.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka maneuvered Unit 02 off the catapult and awaited the delivery of 
her rifle. It was the most powerful in NERV&#39;s arsenal, firing a 
rocket-assisted, HE (high explosive) penetrator to near-orbital 
altitudes. There was only one weapon that could match it in terms of 
delivering power at extreme ranges and that was the commandeered JSDF 
positron laser rifle. The problem was that at the range they were 
dealing with the laser lost much of its energy, which is why it was 
relegated to a backup role in this case.

Warning klaxons sounded as the lift bringing Asuka&#39;s rifle rose to the 
surface. The red Eva reached out and collected the rifle from its 
carriage. Asuka shouldered the rifle and dropped her targeting hood, 
waiting for the angel to come into range.

Much to Asuka&#39;s frustration, the angel steadfastly refused to cooperate. 
It hovered just out of range, seemingly teasing her as her targeting 
indicators drifted tantalizingly close to achieving a target lock. 
Asuka, not a patient person by nature, found it maddening.

Suddenly, a beam of pure, white light stabbed down from the angel. The 
surprise caused Asuka to jerk the trigger on her controls sending a shot 
downrange to fall miles short of the target. Then the effects of the 
beam illuminating her began to take effect.

Asuka could feel the angel invading her mind and she lost control of her 
Eva. The Eva thrashed about, firing the rifle wildly as it did so, 
sending HE shells raining down on the city before it until the rifle&#39;s 
ammo was depleted. Dropping the useless rifle, Unit 02 clutched at its 
head in a desperate attempt to ward off the effects of the beam.

In the entry plug, Asuka too was fighting to keep the angel out of her 
head.

&quot;NOOOO!&quot; Asuka cried. &quot;Don&#39;t come in my head! Stay out of my mind!&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Back inside the NERV control center, Maya was monitoring Asuka&#39;s brain 
functions.

&quot;We&#39;re showing signs of thought contamination all across her ego 
border!&quot; Maya said urgently.

&quot;It&#39;s attacking her mind!&quot; Ritsuko exclaimed. &quot;How can it know that much 
about us?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got to get her out of there!&quot; Misato shouted. &quot;Asuka! Retreat! 
Get out of the beam!&quot;

&quot;No! I can&#39;t! Can&#39;t retreat...&quot; Asuka wailed. &quot;No! Don&#39;t show me that! I 
don&#39;t want to remember! R-Ranma, where are you?&quot;

&quot;Rei! Take the shot!&quot; Misato ordered.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rei said calmly.

Rei stood behind the massive positron laser, its huge barrel resting on 
the top of a building and lined up her shot. Achieving a target lock, 
she depressed the trigger. Windows blew out of every nearby building as 
the beam of intense energy superheated the air along its path. The beam 
rose up through the atmosphere on target, only to splash uselessly 
against the angel&#39;s AT field.

&quot;It&#39;s no good!&quot; Hyuga announced. &quot;The beam doesn&#39;t have enough energy to 
penetrate the AT field!&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Misato cursed, furiously trying to come up with something, 
anything to take out the angel.

&quot;Vital signs are becoming erratic!&quot; Maya reported. &quot;We&#39;re losing her!&quot;

&quot;Let me go out there!&quot; Ranma yelled.

&quot;Negative,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;We can&#39;t risk Unit 01 at this time.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t be a risk if I take that thing out,&quot; Ranma snarled.

&quot;What if you can&#39;t?&quot; Gendo asked.

&quot;I can, and I will!&quot; Ranma snapped. &quot;Asuka needs my help and I don&#39;t 
lose.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t take that chance,&quot; Gendo said.

&quot;Then what are we going to do?&quot; Misato demanded. &quot;We can&#39;t just leave 
Asuka out there to die!&quot;

&quot;You are right,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;Send Rei to Terminal Dogma to retrieve the 
Lance.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Misato demanded. &quot;We can&#39;t do that! Adam is in there and if Adam 
meets Eva, we&#39;ll trigger the Third Impact.&quot;

&quot;The Lance of Longinous is the only thing we have that can destroy that 
angel,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;Bring her in to get the Lance. Now.&quot;

&quot;So that was just another lie,&quot; Misato muttered as Rei was directed to 
retrieve the weapon.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka found herself running. She was running to catch up to Ranma and 
Rei who were walking away, arm in arm.

&quot;Variable-chan, Rei-chan, wait for me!&quot; she called to them, but they 
didn&#39;t seem to hear her. &quot;Please wait! Please don&#39;t leave me!&quot;

&quot;Why would they wait for someone like you?&quot; a voice asked. &quot;You&#39;re not 
good enough for them. You never were.&quot;

&quot;No! I love them and they love me!&quot; Asuka wailed.

&quot;Why would they possibly love someone as worthless as you?&quot; the voice 
asked. &quot;That&#39;s why your father left, because you weren&#39;t good enough for 
him.&quot;

&quot;Nooo!&quot; Asuka wailed, falling to her knees and covering her ears, but 
still the voice continued.

&quot;Even your mother killed herself because you weren&#39;t good enough. She 
hung herself out of shame, having given birth to a useless piece of 
trash like you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true!&quot; Asuka sobbed.

But still the voice continued, showing her scenes of every time in her 
life she had failed, the death of her mother, every horrible moment she 
had ever experienced. Asuka&#39;s psyche was relentlessly beaten down and 
crushed.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei finally reached the surface, Lance in hand. It had a long shaft that 
split into two halves that coiled around each other before extending out 
into two tines.

&quot;I am in position,&quot; Rei said calmly. &quot;I am preparing to launch the 
Lance.&quot;

Rei drew back and paused to allow the computers to calculate the shot. 
Once they made the adjustments, she initiated the throw. Unit 00 
propelled the lance downrange with mighty heave. As soon as the lance 
left the Eva&#39;s hands it turned into a bolt of energy that stabbed 
through the clouds and streaked toward the target.

The angel brought up its AT field but the lance pierced through it as if 
it were mere rice paper before penetrating the body of the angel causing 
it to disintegrate.

&quot;It worked!&quot; Hyuga reported. &quot;The angel is destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Status of the Lance?&quot; Gendo asked.

&quot;It achieved escape velocity, Sir,&quot; Hyuga answered. &quot;It&#39;s now in lunar 
orbit.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s no way to retrieve it,&quot; Gendo said.

&quot;No, we have no way to retrieve an object of that mass,&quot; Hyuga stated.

&quot;What about Asuka?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Recovery teams are on the scene,&quot; Aoba reported. &quot;She&#39;s alive and 
they&#39;ve managed to get her out of Unit 02. They have her in a 
quarantined area incase of contamination. They&#39;re retrieving the Eva 
now.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma was running toward the area where Asuka was sitting. A guard 
stepped in his path.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry but you can&#39;t go in there,&quot; the guard said. &quot;This area is 
quarantined.&quot;

Ranma ignored him, leaping over the guard&#39;s head and into the area 
marked off with yellow tape.

&quot;Asuka-chan!&quot; Ranma shouted as he sprinted up to the girl as she sat 
dejectedly on the ground. &quot;Asuka-chan, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Asuka shrieked. &quot;No, I&#39;m not alright! Leave me alone. I&#39;m not good 
enough for you anyway. You&#39;ll just leave me behind. Just like my father. 
Just like my mother.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma said in confusion. &quot;Asuka-chan, I love you! I don&#39;t think 
you&#39;re not good enough for me! If anything, I&#39;m not good enough for 
you!&quot;

Ranma scooped the redhead up into his arms and held her close. She began 
to struggle, but he didn&#39;t let her go. Asuka began to sob and pound on 
his chest with her small fists. Eventually she gave in and wept into his 
chest.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma whispered soothingly. &quot;I&#39;m right here and 
I&#39;m not going anywhere. I love you and I think you&#39;re way more than good 
enough for me.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hello,&quot; Kaji said with a pleasant smile as three men with guns drawn 
entered the room. &quot;So at last you&#39;ve found me. I&#39;ve been expecting you. 
My friend really wanted to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Hiya, fellas,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully.

Two of the men whirled around toward the pigtailed martial artist. A 
shot rang out and three men crumpled to the ground. One of them wouldn&#39;t 
be getting back up.

&quot;So I guess now you have to disappear?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Yes, but I wanted to arrange a contact for you before I vanished,&quot; Kaji 
said. &quot;You can trust Misato. She&#39;s been working with me since just after 
the 12th angel. From now on, your contact for JSDF Intelligence will be 
through her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll miss you,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaji said.

&quot;I&#39;ll take care of her for you,&quot; Ranma offered.

&quot;You have my thanks,&quot; Kaji said, offering his hand. Ranma took it and 
they shook. &quot;You had better go. I&#39;ll take care of things here. Best of 
luck to you.&quot;

&quot;My luck ain&#39;t never been good,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;I&#39;ll rely on my skill, 
thanks.&quot;

&quot;And formidable skill it is,&quot; Kaji smiled. &quot;Fare thee well, Ranma 
Ikari.&quot;

&quot;You too, Kaji.&quot; Ranma turned and left.

(oO\O/Oo)

Nabiki stopped the tape and looked around at the others. Nobody looked 
like they had much to say, so she figured she&#39;d put a thought out there.

&quot;Anyone else think it&#39;s hilarious that Ranma, the man among men, 
machoest of the macho, had to explain what to do about a period to 
Asuka?&quot; Nabiki snickered.

Cologne burst out laughing while the fianc&eacute;es looked a bit green.

&quot;Oh what I would have given to be a fly on the wall during that 
demonstration,&quot; Cologne chortled.

&quot;And who knew he could be so comforting?&quot; Nabiki said in amazement. &quot;I 
guess whoever ends up with him is going to be a very lucky girl. I, for 
one, can vouch for Kasumi&#39;s massage techniques. They&#39;re very soothing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad Ranma is finally getting to use them,&quot; Kasumi said 
happily.</pre>
