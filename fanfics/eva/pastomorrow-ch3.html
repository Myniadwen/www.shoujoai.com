<h1>Past, as it will be tomorrow (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/pastomorrow-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Where the hell is my daughter?&quot; Dr. Naoko Akagi
demanded, the black haired woman barging into the
office of the commander of GEHRIN without waiting for
permission. She glared at her superior, &quot;Well?&quot;

Yui Ikari looked up from her paperwork tiredly, the
brown haired woman giving her a cross look. &quot;Do you
seriously believe I&#39;m going to answer that?&quot; she asked
mildly.

Naoko met her gaze defiantly for a moment, then she
finally had to look away. She slumped tiredly in the
guest chair, the side of her face still marked by a
livid bruise. &quot;Is Ritsuko all right?&quot; she asked
instead.

&quot;Do you care?&quot; Yui asked softly.

&quot;Of course I do!&quot; Naoko burst out.

&quot;Misato tells me she&#39;s fine,&quot; Yui answered as she
looked at her guest curiously, &quot;if still quite angry
with you.&quot;

Naoko flushed slightly. While talking with Yui she had
taken a harsh tone with her daughter&#39;s safety, but
unbeknownst to her Ritsuko had been listening in.
Irrationally upset she had slapped her to the ground
then fled before Naoko could explain.

&quot;We need a pilot...&quot; Naoko started.

Yui fixed her with a look, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to
attempt to draft Ritsuko? Because if you do I will
oppose that.&quot;

&quot;No, trying to force a pilot wouldn&#39;t be wise,&quot; Naoko
answered a bit stiffly, &quot;however, I have another pilot
candidate in mind.&quot; With that she pointed to one of
the files already sitting on Yue&#39;s desk.

Yue flipped the folder open, studying the black haired
girl. &quot;She&#39;s kind of young,&quot; she noted, seeing her age
listed as fifteen.

&quot;Maybe, but her youth may actually make her more
compatable,&quot; Naoko countered, &quot;and she&#39;s a volunteer.&quot;

Yui frowned but nodded reluctantly. &quot;All right,&quot; she
said, &quot;let&#39;s call in your prodigy, Miss Maya Ibuki.&quot;

Meanwhile, Ritsuko Akagi and Misato Katsuragi watched
as a very unusual transfer student was introduced to
their university classes. The professor pushed up her
glasses, &quot;Our newest transfer is here on a accelerated
program, having graduated highschool at fourteen.&quot; She
gestured to the girl at her side, &quot;This is Maya Ibuki,
please make her feel welcome.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; The black haired girl bowed, blushing
furiously. Dressed in a another school&#39;s uniform she
looked rather embarrassed to be standing under their
gaze, her short black hair scruffy and unevenly cut.

&quot;She&#39;s a high school graduate?&quot; Ritsuko murmured from
where she sat near Misato.

Misato blinked as she whispered back, &quot;Guess you can&#39;t
tell by looks alone.&quot;

Maya stiffly walked to a open desk, sitting not far
from where they were. She got her books out and seemed
to follow the work easily, despite just jumping into
the class. All in all she seemed like a good addition
to the class, at least so far.

One of their fellow students joined them as they left
class for lunch, the gangly young man looking oddly
out of synch without his usual cigarette. &quot;So what&#39;s
the prodigy like?&quot; Kaji wondered, scratching as his
stubble covered chin.

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Misato answered honestly, &quot;we&#39;ve barely met.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d be more interested,&quot; Kaji gave them
both a sly smile, &quot;or haven&#39;t you heard the rumor she
may be interning at GHERIN?&quot;

Ritsuko looked up at him in surprise, &quot;Seriously?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s from a pretty reliable source,&quot; Kaji winked, not
mentioning that he&#39;d gotten that little tidbit by
sleeping with a older but attractive woman working at
GHERIN.

Misato still looked dubious but Ritsuko was frowning
slightly as she murmured, &quot;Maybe I should look into
this.&quot;

With that Ritsuko strode off and with a smile Kaji
slid closer to Misato. &quot;How about we...?&quot; he purred.

With a elbow to the gut Misato sent him staggering
backwards as she firmly said, &quot;Not a chance.&quot; Leaving
the gasping man to his own devices Misato walked away,
taking care to hang back a bit from Ritsuko.

Ritsuko hurried along, though if someone asked she
couldn&#39;t have explained why she was looking for Maya.
Part of it was curiosity, and maybe Ritsuko also
wanted to warn her about her mother...

&quot;Get back here, you little...&quot; a voice growled.

&quot;Help!&quot; Maya yelped and Ritsuko hurried to race around
a corner. The tall young man menacing Maya was smart
but crude, having used his physical power to dominate
any of the weaker students.

&quot;Let her go,&quot; Ritsuko ordered with a scowl, seeing the
big man clutching Maya&#39;s neck with a large hand.

&quot;Make me,&quot; the bully scoffed.

Without thinking about it Ritsuko drew on the self
defense classes her mother had made her take. Lunging
forward she grabbed the thumb of the gripping hand,
making him yelp in pain and release Maya. As he lunged
at Ritsuko she slipped away and grabbed his arm,
shifting her center of balance and using a simple
throw to send him crashing into a wall.

Maya gaped at Ritsuko, &quot;You...&quot;

Ritsuko grabbed at her hand, &quot;He&#39;s not going to stay
down forever, let&#39;s go!

&quot;Ri... right!&quot; Maya followed, her eyes bright with
surprise and other emotions.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Misato blinked as both women ran by her, then
heard the bully&#39;s rage filled groan. Quickly, she
decided running with Rits and Maya was a good plan.
&quot;What did you do?&quot; she said as soon as she caught up
to Ritsuko.

&quot;Knocked a bully on his ass,&quot; Ritsuko admitted as they
went into a deserted classroom to buy themselves some
time.

&quot;I guessed,&quot; Misato puffed, catching her breath. She
looked at Maya, &quot;You all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Maya answered, looking at Ritsuko with a
expression that could almost be called adoring. Or
maybe enraptured.

&#39;Well, well, well,&#39; Misato thought, hiding a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Ritsuko sighed, &quot;though my poor impulse
control may have just made you a lifelong enemy
today.&quot;

Maya sighed quietly, &quot;It&#39;s nothing new, Miss...?&quot;

Ritsuko looked sheepish, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m Ritsuko Akagi. And
the madly grinning woman over there is Misato
Katsuragi.&quot;

&quot;Madly?&quot; Misato looked amused.

&quot;Wipe that smile off your face, we&#39;re in serious
trouble if he catches us,&quot; Ritsuko pointed out.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Maya looked surprised, &quot;I&#39;m sure you could
handle him again.&quot;

Ritsuko gave her a odd look. &quot;No,&quot; she shook her head,
&quot;I got lucky catching him by surprise. Round two,
we&#39;re in trouble.&quot; Just then they heard the welcome
sounds of the principal, yelling, and security guys
going to work with tasers.

&quot;Should we look?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Can&#39;t hurt,&quot; Ritsuko said as they pushed the door
open.

Outside, the security forces were pulling the now
stunned bully away, who was still grumbling about
girls beating up on him and his rights being violated
somehow. All three women breathed a loud sigh of
relief as he disappeared around a corner, then
silently decided to return to their classroom.

&quot;Who was that guy?&quot; Maya asked tentatively.

&quot;Susuhara,&quot; Misato answered her promptly, &quot;a big lug
who usually thinks better with his fists than his
brains.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Maya nodded. When they reached the classroom
Maya quickly pulled the door open, &quot;Here,
Ritsuko-senpai.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to call me that,&quot; Ritsuko blushed.

&quot;Let her,&quot; Misato smirked, &quot;it&#39;s harmless.&quot;

Ritsuko gave her a frown, but decided it was better
not to argue. &#39;And I never did get the chance to talk
to her about mother or GEHRIN,&#39; she thought glumly.

&quot;Why were you looking for me, Ritsuko-senpai?&quot; Maya
wondered as they all headed back to their desks.

&quot;There was something I wanted to talk to you about,&quot;
Ritsuko admitted.

&quot;REALLY?&quot; Maya&#39;s eyes shone happily.

Ritsuko gulped, &quot;We&#39;ll talk after class.&quot; She looked
over at the chortling Misato, &quot;nd stop laughing.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; Misato chuckled.

To be continued...

Notes: Yes, that&#39;s Toji Susuhara&#39;s dad. Poor kid.
