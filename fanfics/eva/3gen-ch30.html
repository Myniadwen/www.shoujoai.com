<h1>Third Genesis (part 30 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>There was a soft hiss of movement as they descended
the elevator moving gently downward into the depths of
the NERV facility. Misato, Ritsuko, and Maya stood to
one side, talking, even as Asuka, Rei and Yui-shinji
stood together nearby.

&quot;I wonder what they&#39;re being so mysterious about?&quot;
Asuka Soryuu Langley asked irritably, the orange
haired young woman dressed in a NERV uniform. Her eye
patch seemed to darken her face slightly, combining
with her irritation to give her a grim look.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Rei Ayanami answered mildly, her dark
blue hair falling into her eyes.

&quot;Wonder if we&#39;re going all the way down to the Skunk
Works?&quot; Yui mused, brown hair just a bit untidy
looking. She looked casual in her jump suit, wearing a
borrowed lab coat over it and her pockets loaded with
notebook, pens and personal computer.

&quot;Skunk Works?&quot; Asuka looked confused.

&quot;It&#39;s the nickname the research and development wing
has,&quot; Maya Ibuki said faintly apologetically, &quot;taken
from the R&amp;D wing of Lougheed-Martin aircraft.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Rei nodded slightly in understanding.

&quot;Is that where we&#39;re going?&quot; Misato Katsuragi asked
impatiently, her black hair swept back from her face.
Like usual she was out of uniform, wearing a casual
dress and her red jacket, her rank insignia pinned on
the collar. She was less than pleased with her staff
being mysterious, only going along because Ritsuko had
urged her to.

&quot;Just be patient a few more moments,&quot; Maya smiled, her
short brown hair and uniform giving her a decidedly
boyish look.

Ritsuko Akagi looked amused as the blonde remarked,
&quot;You have to admit that Misato&#39;s never been known for
her patience.&quot;

Misato rolled her eyes, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;

Yui shook her head at their interactions, smiling
wryly. &quot;So how&#39;s school been going?&quot; she asked Asuka
and Rei curiously.

Asuka made an ugly face at that while Rei just smiled
mildly. &quot;It was annoying enough going to school here
the first time around,&quot; Asuka complained grumpily, &quot;it
feels like it&#39;s even more of a waste of time, now.&quot;

Rei squeezed her hand gently. &quot;I like it,&quot; she
revealed, &quot;especially spending time with our friends
Hikaru, Toji and Aida.&quot;

Before anyone could comment on that they came to a
stop with a soft thump, the platform resting in a
simple cradle. A motorized walkway came online and
Maya gestured to it as she said, &quot;It&#39;s not far now.&quot;

&quot;It had better be,&quot; Misato grumped as they all stepped
on, &quot;I can&#39;t even use my cell phone to check in with
the office down here.&quot;

&quot;Consider this a break from that,&quot; Asuka offered with
a slight smile.

It only took them a minute or so to reach the doorway,
Maya typing in the access code easily from memory. The
heavy door opened up to reveal an observation platform
and beyond that... a giant. Partially submerged it
looked like an Evangelion at first, but the small
details were slightly off. Muscular and well developed
it looked healthy, much more human than an Evangelion,
an almost human face gazing out from a mask that
concealed the lower face.

&quot;I&#39;d like to present Unit-Alpha,&quot; Maya said to them
with obvious pride in her voice, &quot;the first of the new
Archangels.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Misato breathed out. She had seen it
in various stages of construction, of course, but
seeing it fully functional was an entirely different
experience.

&quot;It&#39;s not entirely ready to go yet,&quot; Ritsuko cautioned
them all, &quot;but we&#39;re nearly there.&quot;

Yui seemed to shake herself out of her stunned
silence, the boy&#39;s body she inhabited looking
surprisingly mature. &quot;I suspect it&#39;s the programming
that&#39;s taking the extra time?&quot; she guessed.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Maya nodded seriously, &quot;we had to throw out
the coding for the original Evangelions and start from
scratch.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Asuka asked, unable to tear her eyes away from
the red painted Archangel.

&quot;After debugging the code we ultimately found it was
incompatible with the Archangel&#39;s systems,&quot; Ritsuko
revealed.

&quot;I&#39;d like to help,&quot; Yui murmured.

&quot;We&#39;ll be glad to have you,&quot; Maya agreed.

Quietly Asuka moved over to Rei&#39;s side, where the dark
blue haired girl gazed out at the giant figure. &quot;Are
you all right?&quot; she asked her.

Rei smiled up at her gratefully and said, &quot;I think
so.&quot; She looked back out at Unit Alpha, &quot;It&#39;s strange,
but when I&#39;m around the Evangelions I can feel a
presence within them... but there&#39;s nothing from the
Archangel.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting?&quot; Ritsuko murmured to Misato.

Misato also kept her voice down, &quot;I guess she still
has enough of Adam&#39;s DNA to maintain that connection.
But why doesn&#39;t she get anything from the Archangel?&quot;

Ritsuko and Misato made their way to one of the
railings, looking out across the pool that the
Archangel stood waiting in. &quot;We&#39;ve known for a while
now that the Evangelions have,&quot; Ritsuko hesitated, &quot;a
consciousness or possibly a soul.&quot;

Tactfully Misato didn&#39;t mention that one of those
souls might be Ritsuko&#39;s mother. &quot;Right,&quot; she prompted
her.

&quot;With the Archangel we think we&#39;ve managed to avoid
that,&quot; Ritsuko continued, &quot;but we&#39;ll need to run final
tests to be sure. It&#39;s also why we needed to throw out
the Evangelion operating system... it took into
account the consciousness of the Unit.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Misato conceded.


Yui moved over to where Asuka and Rei stood. &quot;I
noticed it&#39;s been painted in your colors,&quot; she said to
Asuka, &quot;how do you feel?&quot;

&quot;Excited but nervous,&quot; Asuka admitted. She looked at
the Archangel, &quot;I mean if all goes according to plan I
may be flying that into space after Shinji.&quot;

Rei put a hand on her arm and squeezed, &quot;I know you
can do it.&quot;


&quot;I haven&#39;t seen much of you yet,&quot; Yui murmured, &quot;but
I&#39;m certain you can do it.&quot; She looked thoughtful as
she gazed off into the distance, &quot;I just wish I knew
for sure he wanted to be rescued.&quot;

Asuka blinked at her in surprise, &quot;Do you really think
he&#39;s happier inside the Unit-01?&quot;

Yui puffed out a breath as she admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t
really know. All I&#39;ve got is a nagging feeling I can&#39;t
quite explain.&quot;

Maya joined Ritsuko and Misato, smiling in pride as
they all observed her teams&#39; work. &quot;I noticed it&#39;s
been painted for Asuka,&quot; Misato noted.

&quot;She is our primary pilot so far,&quot; Maya acknowledged.
She looked at Misato curiously, &quot;Are we seriously
considering other pilot candidates?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Misato conceded, &quot;I suppose I&#39;m just
being pessimistic.&quot;

Quietly Ritsuko said, &quot;I know that Shinji&#39;s friend
Aida has wanted to be an Evangelion pilot for awhile,
and we could always approach their classmates.&quot; She
saw the irritated look on Misato&#39;s face and sighed,
&quot;You originally suggested we look into it.&quot;

Maya looked a bit concerned as she saw Misato face
actually get grimmer. &quot;It is possible Asuka won&#39;t
synch with the Unit Alpha,&quot; she cautioned her, &quot;we
need to be prepared.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Misato said, &quot;I just keep thinking of what
happened to Asuka and Toji. I don&#39;t want to see
another child hurt that way.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Ritsuko shrugged, &quot;but our
responsibilities may not leave us with any choice.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, maybe.&quot; Misato shook off her annoyance as she
addressed the group, &quot;All right everyone, let&#39;s get
out of here.&quot;</pre>
