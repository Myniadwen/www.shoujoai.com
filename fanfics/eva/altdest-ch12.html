<h1>Altered Destinies (part 12 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/altdest-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Gendo Ikari read the report in his massive office, his
expression remote as he read about the encounter with
the aquatic angel. The dark brown haired man finally
looked up from the documents at Kaji as he asked him,
&quot;So, do you think the Angel sensed the Evangelion, or
what you were carrying?&quot;

Kaji shrugged as he put the case down on Gendo&#39;s desk,
&quot;Who knows? We still have very little idea of the
Angels&#39; capabilities.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Gendo almost looked like he was ready to grab
at the case in eagerness as he continued bitingly, &quot;at
least you were able to complete your mission, Mr.
Inspector from the United Nations.&quot;

Quite calmly Kaji popped the locks, the case swinging
open to reveal something that looked like a cross
between a sea creature and a developing life form.
&quot;Adam,&quot; Kaji agreed, &quot;direct from SEELE to you, sir.&quot;
A pause then he carefully asked, &quot;Is this part of the
Instrumentality project, sir?&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Gendo closed the case, his expression
carefully remote as he said firmly, &quot;is need to know
only.&quot;

Kaji nodded calmly, &quot;Understood.&quot;

Emerging from the shadows as Kaji left Fuyutsuki said
seriously, &quot;He knows more than he&#39;s letting on.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gendo seemed unsurprised, &quot;her serves
three masters, at least. If you&#39;re playing that sort
of game you&#39;d better be smart.&quot;

&quot;Three?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked, his short grey hair combed
back neatly.

&quot;The UN, SEELE and NERV,&quot; Gendo answered with a shrug.
&quot;It&#39;s a dangerous game he&#39;s playing, one that could
be... fatal.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do what needs to be done,&quot; Fuyutsuki said.

Meanwhile, in another part of the city a door opened
as a woman&#39;s voice called out, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m home!&quot;

Shinji Ikari sighed as she looked at her guardian, &quot;Do
you have to do that?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Misato smirked, the black haired woman leading
Shinji inside. She walked into the kitchen with the
take out bags even as Ritsuko emerged from their
bedroom, &quot;Hi love.&quot;

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Ritsuko paused to kiss Misato hello
then helped her with the bags. A smile tugged her
lips, &quot;I understand you look good in red, Shinji.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Shinji blushed faintly.

With a impish smirk Ritsuko said, &quot;Maya emailed me her
report in before you all got back, I read all the
juicy details.&quot; A bit more apologetic she added, &quot;I
would have come meet you but something came up at the
lab.&quot;

&quot;S&#39;alright,&quot; Misato sat down tiredly.

Shinji and Ritsuko quickly began opening up the
various containers and setting out the food, steaming
plates soon set up in front of all three of them.
&quot;Beer?&quot; Ritsuko asked as she paused in front of the
fridge.

&quot;You have to ask?&quot; Misato smiled.

&quot;Thanks for the food,&quot; Shinji murmured then dug in.

&quot;So,&quot; Ritsuko asked in between mouthfuls of dinner,
&quot;what did you think of Miss Asuka Soryu Langley?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s... unique,&quot; Shinji admitted.

Misato fought back a snort of laughter. &quot;She&#39;s as much
of a spitfire as ever,&quot; she agreed, &quot;and she still
hates Ayanami&#39;s guts.&quot;

&quot;Psychological issues?&quot; Ritsuko raised a eyebrow in
question.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Misato shrugged.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Shinji looked curious.

&quot;I can&#39;t go into much as it&#39;s from her private files,&quot;
Ritsuko sounded faintly apologetic as she continued
on, &quot;let&#39;s just say you aren&#39;t the only one with
family issues.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Shinji nodded as she ate, occasionally dropping
a piece of fried fish for the penguin Pen Pen. &quot;Where
will she be staying?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll get the option of NERV housing or a host
family,&quot; Ritsuko answered.

&quot;Anything interesting happen while we were gone?&quot;
Misato asked, looking over at Ritsuko with undisguised
tenderness.

&quot;Another of our classmates is getting hitched,&quot;
Ritsuko revealed, &quot;we got the invitation in the mail
earlier this week.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with this lemming like rush to wedded bliss?&quot;
Misato bitched. She sighed, &quot;Rits-chan, you&#39;re going
to have to make me a honest women.&quot;

Ritsuko winked, &quot;Just name the time and place.&quot;

&quot;Anything else interesting happen?&quot; Shinji asked with
a blush.

Misato chuckled, &quot;Poor Shinji.&quot;

Taking pity on her Ritsuko said, &quot;Well, it seems we
have a rival.&quot;

&quot;Of?&quot; Shinji looked curious.

&quot;Jet Alone had it&#39;s test run,&quot; Ritsuko revealed, &quot;it
was successful, surprisingly enough. Gendo&#39;s not
happy, as you can imagine.&quot;

&quot;I bet,&quot; Misato nodded with a grin.

&quot;Why would dear old dad,&quot; Shinji&#39;s voice dripped
sarcasm, &quot;be unhappy about us possibly getting help?&quot;

Ritsuko fought back a smile, &#145;Shinji really doesn&#39;t
like Gendo much.&#39; Calmly she said, &quot;I think he&#39;s
concerned that Jet Alone might interfere with our
Anti-Angel efforts.&quot;

&quot;So did Jet Alone go with a piloted or unmanned
model?&quot; Misato pulled the discussion away from Gendo.

&quot;Manned,&quot; Ritsuko answered, &quot;it seems they ALSO want
to copy the AT field, and to have a chance in hell
they need a pilot.&quot;

&quot;Ambitious,&quot; Misato conceded.

&quot;Do you know who they got to be a pilot?&quot; Shinji asked
curiously.

&quot;A young lady about your age,&quot; Ritsuko said calmly,
&quot;at least according to her file. A Miss Mana
Kirishima.&quot;

&quot;Mana?&quot; Shinji blinked.

&quot;You know her?&quot; Misato looked at her curiously.

&quot;If it&#39;s the same girl,&quot; Shinji frowned as she
finished up her soup, &quot;then yeah, I think she&#39;s in my
class.&quot;

&quot;And isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Ritsuko blinked.

&quot;All right Shinji,&quot; Misato said as she scooped up the
last of her rice, &quot;get close to her and learn all her
secrets.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Shinji frowned.

&quot;Kidding,&quot; Misato casually waved a fork, &quot;but...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;I do think we&#39;ll take a look into this Mana,&quot; Misato
washed her food down with her beer, &quot;just in case.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t do anything too embarrassing,&quot; Shinji
sighed.

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Misato asked innocently.

&quot;My classmates are still talking about the time you
went to see my teacher in that mini-skirt,&quot; Shinji
pointed out.

Ritsuko chuckled, &quot;She&#39;s got you there.&quot;

Later that evening, when Shinji had retired with his
MP3 player and Misato and Ritsuko were lounging on the
couch Misato poked Ritsuko in the side and said,
&quot;Okay, spill.&quot;

&quot;You saw me react to Mana being her classmate?&quot;
Ritsuko murmured.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Misato said, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something from Gendo&#39;s private files,&quot; Ritsuko
revealed, &quot;about the children in Shinji&#39;s class.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Misato asked impatiently.

&quot;They&#39;re all on the Marduk lists,&quot; Ritsuko revealed,
&quot;as potential candidates to pilot Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned...&quot;

To be continued...
