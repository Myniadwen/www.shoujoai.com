        &quot;A very good question,&quot; Misato admitted. She looked over at 
Rei, &quot;What sort of clothes would you like?&quot;

        Rei smiled back shyly, &quot;I really don&#39;t know.&quot;

        &quot;Then let&#39;s hit the clothing district,&quot; Asuka suggested, &quot;and 
let Rei try some different things on. That way she can decide for 
herself.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Misato agreed.

        Maya started up the engine, looking over at Ritsuko with a 
little smile as if she was asking her for her opinion. Ritsuko smiled 
back, &quot;Lets go.&quot;

        &quot;Oh my,&quot; Asuka said weakly as Rei stepped out of the change 
room dressed in a school uniform. They had used her old size to start 
with, but obviously that wasn&#39;t going to work.

        Rei tugged at the too short skirt self conciously, while being 
careful not to take too deep of a breath in case she popped open her 
blouse. Misato was killing herself laughing, while Ritsuko and Maya 
were fighting off a similar urge.

        &quot;I think we&#39;ll have to try a size larger,&quot; Asuka finally 
managed to get out.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei puffed out a sigh before going back into the 
change room.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Misato finally was able to get her laughter under 
control.

        Asuka shook her head, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you two are suposed to 
be the adults.&quot; She looked at Maya, &quot;Not that you managed much 
better.&quot;

        Maya nodded meekly, but there was a amused twikle in her eye, 
&quot;I&#39;m just glad we didn&#39;t get a swimsuit for her to try on in that 
size.&quot;

        Asuka suddenly had a mental image of Rei nearly spilling out 
of a swimsuit appear in her head and had to blush furiously.

        &#39;Interesting, very interesting,&#39; Ritsuko noted. Aloud she 
said, &quot;Let&#39;s go grab her another uniform, then. Some slacks and 
shirts, too.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Misato smiled slightly. Turig to the change booth she 
called out, &quot;Rei, what color clothes do you want?&quot;

        Without really thinking about it Rei opened up the door, 
&quot;White and blue.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, god,&quot; Asuka squeaked, turning quickly away from the nude 
Rei.

        Ritsuko stepped forward and shut the door firmly, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 
Quietly to Misato, &quot;We might want to try to explain to her the concept 
of modesty.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a good idea,&quot; Misato agreed, noting the blushes 
on both Asuka and Maya. &quot;You take care of Maya, I&#39;ve got Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Ritsuko nodded. She grabbed Maya&#39;s hand, &quot;Come o, 
let&#39;s go find Rei a few more items to try on.&quot;

        &quot;Right, Sempai,&quot; Maya stammered.

        &quot;You all right?&quot; Misato stepped uip to Asuka.

        &quot;Sorry, she just surprised me,&quot; Asuka said quietly.

        &quot;She&#39;ll probably keep doing that too,&quot; Misato sighed. Asuka 
looked at her curiously so she explained, &quot;It looks like Gendo 
educated her about the EVAs and NERV, but he left out all the usual 
social skills.&quot;

        &quot;Sort of like the first Rei,&quot; Asuka murmured.

        Misato shook her head, &quot;No, even the first Rei had some body 
modesty.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;Though I do remember Rei 
traumatizing Shinji once dressed only in a towel.&quot;

        &quot;Now there&#39;s a interesting mental image,&quot; Asuka mumbled.
