<h1>Third Genesis (part 31 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>The command center was busy as Maya Ibuki stood behind
the central control panel, her eyes intent. &quot;Are you
ready, Asuka?&quot; she asked crisply, her short brown hair
falling gently around her almost boyish face.

&quot;Ready,&quot; Asuka Soryu Langley said from the pilot&#39;s
seat, her orange hair clipped back, the skin tight
plugsuit clinging to every curve of her body. Her
black eyepatch over the left eye was a dark spot in
the liquid filled chamber, the LCL surrounding and
shielding her.

&quot;Then let&#39;s do this,&quot; Misato Katsuragi said from where
she sat up in the command chair, &quot;and test activate
Archangel Unit Alpha.&quot;

&quot;Bringing on tertiary connections now,&quot; Yui Ikari said
from within the body of her son Shinji, fingers flying
across the controls. After a moment she said,
&quot;Tertiary connection green.&quot;

&quot;Asuka?&quot; Ritsuko Akagi asked calmly, the blonde haired
scientist looking up at the image of the pilot before
them.

Asuka sat in the control seat, one modeled after the
one in Evangelion. &quot;A slight headache,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;but other than that I&#39;m fine.&quot; She frowned, &quot;But I
don&#39;t seem to be getting any feedback from the
Archangel.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Ritsuko reassured her, &quot;you wouldn&#39;t at
this point.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s move on,&quot; Asuka shrugged, hands squeezing
each control grip.

&quot;Asuka...&quot; Rei Ayanami murmured, the dark blue haired
younger woman standing over to the side, watching with
concern.

&quot;Secondary connections on-line,&quot; Yui announced after a
nod from Maya, watching the display on her board.
&quot;Some feedback wobble appearing in the synronization
wave-form, but well within acceptable tolerances.&quot;

Maya moved fast, leaning over her shoulder to check
the reading. &quot;Two point five percent,&quot; she murmured
then up to Asuka. &quot;How does it feel?&quot; she asked.

Asuka had her head tilted to the side, a odd
expression on her face. &quot;It feels nice,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;I can sense the Archangel now, though the sensation
is almost like there&#39;s a thick layer of glass between
me and it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the protective buffer we created,&quot; Ritsuko
said, &quot;it should prevent sensory overload from the
Unit to your nervous system.&quot;

&quot;But you can sense the Archangel?&quot; Misato asked
intently.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Asuka nodded then frowned, &quot;but I can&#39;t
move...&quot;

Ritsuko looked up at Misato, &quot;Do we go on?&quot;

Silently Misato tried to get a sense for Asuka&#39;s
readiness and got only confidence from the young
pilot. &quot;All right, bring first stage connection on.&quot;

&quot;First stage, go,&quot; Yui agreed, she and Maya nearly
sitting at the console together as they watched the
readings like a hawk. &quot;Feedback wobble up to three
percent,&quot; Yui added.

&quot;Still have the headache?&quot; Misato asked Asuka quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s a bit worse,&quot; Asuka admitted with a frown, &quot;but
still tolerable. The Archangel feels ready, can I move
to out of the cage?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Maya said, keeping a half eye on the
readings, &quot;but take it slow.&quot;

Outside in the massive chamber the massive locks
released and the Archangel moved forward, the humanoid
fighting machine oddly graceful. Smoothly it brought a
hand up, turning it this way and that, then looked
around the chamber with it&#39;s oddly human looking face.

&quot;What&#39;s moving it like?&quot; Yui asked curiously.

&quot;Harder than an Evangelion,&quot; Asuka confessed, &quot;I have
to concentrate harder and visualize what I&#39;m doing.&quot;
Without her awareness a bit of blood began to flow
from her nose, gradually spreading out into the LCL.

&quot;Asuka, you&#39;re bleeding,&quot; Rei blurted.

&quot;Abort test,&quot; Misato barked, &quot;Asuka, get Unit Alpha
back in place, we&#39;re ejecting the plug as soon as
you&#39;ve parked it.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Asuka nodded quickly, guiding the Unit Alpha
back into place, then the screen going dark as she
ejected from the Archangel.

&quot;Maya, Ritsuko, go over the test data,&quot; Misato said as
she and Rei bolted from the command center, racing out
into the holding pen they were using for the
Archangel.

The metal walkway rang under their steps as they
hurried forward, a medical team already swarming
around Asuka as she got out of the entry plug. &quot;You
should lay down,&quot; one tech said as another held a
cloth to her bloody nose.

&quot;It&#39;s just a nosebleed,&quot; Asuka tried to wave them off.

&quot;We don&#39;t know what it was,&quot; Misato corrected her
firmly.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; Rei took her hand, looking up into her eye
gently as she plead, &quot;please let them examine you...&quot;

Asuka hesitated under Rei&#39;s warm gaze, then finally
nodded reluctantly. &quot;All right,&quot; she finally agreed,
&quot;but make it fast.&quot;

It took nearly a day to find out what happened, a
short time in scientific matters but a long one for
the people involved. Ritsuko, Maya and Yui pulled an
all nighter going over both the test data and the
medical report on Asuka, eventually coming up with a
working theory.

Misato sat behind the desk of her office, the rest of
them scattered around the room. &quot;It was the
Archangel&#39;s sensory data?&quot; Misato repeated
questioningly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ritsuko nodded, &quot;it overloaded Asuka&#39;s system
without her knowing it, triggering the headache first,
then the nosebleed.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s never happened before,&quot; Asuka blinked,
sitting on the couch with Rei holding on protectively
to her hand.

&quot;Because of how the Evangelions were designed they had
multiple layers of defense between the pilot and the
core systems,&quot; Maya explained, &quot;in addition to the
technology designed to restrain the Evangelions from
acting on their own.&quot;

&quot;Those layers also bled out a great deal of sensory
imput from the Eva to the pilot,&quot; Ritsuko sighed,
&quot;much more than we really understood.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to rework the protective sensory
barrier while keeping this event in mind,&quot; Yui
finished grimly, &quot;or possibly consider medicating the
LCL with some kind of drug to try and ease the
effect.&quot;

&quot;No drugs,&quot; Asuka spoke up firmly her eye flashing
angrily, &quot;I had enough of those last time I was in the
hospital.&quot;

&quot;I hate to ask,&quot; Misato gave a apologetic look to
Asuka, &quot;but is this unique to her, or will all pilots
be affected?&quot;

&quot;Any pilot who goes in there will suffer the same
result,&quot; Ritsuko said flatly.

&quot;Understood,&quot; Misato said mildly, &quot;I had to know.&quot; She
looked at Maya, Ritsuko and Yui, &quot;Do we have a idea
how long it&#39;ll take to fix this?&quot;

&quot;No idea,&quot; Maya said promptly, &quot;it&#39;s a whole new
problem.&quot;

&quot;On the bright side,&quot; Yui added, &quot;it gives us more
time to study the transfer effect and what happened
when my son vanished. Even if we use Archangel to get
back Unit-01, we have no idea how to get Shinji out of
there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll work out something,&quot; Misato
said, then dismissed the scientists. Walking to Rei
and Asuka she asked softly, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Asuka pierced her with a intense look. &quot;If it really
was just me having the problem with Unit Alpha, would
you replace me?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;Asuka...&quot; Rei looked startled, looking at her with
concern.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Misato answered promptly, &quot;to protect you from
being hurt again.&quot;

Asuka hesitated then nodded slightly, &quot;All right.&quot;</pre>
