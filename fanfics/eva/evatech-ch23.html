<a href="../eva/evatech-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>&quot;Are you nervous?&quot; Asuka asked softly as she sat in
the dressing room, watching her lover change from her
uniform into a off-white dress. The orange haired
young woman was still in her flight suit, her pose
relaxed but aware as she sat in one of the few chairs.

&quot;A bit,&quot; Rei admitted, adjusting her dress, her red
eyes looking mildly amused, her light blue hair
falling around her face. &quot;I&#39;ve practiced my
preformance,&quot; she added, &quot;but this is my first time
playing in public.&quot;

&quot;One of these days I&#39;m going to get the captain for
insisting a pilot enter,&quot; Asuka growled under her
breath.

&quot;We drew straws, it was as fair as possible,&quot; Rei
noted.

&quot;Since the cap&#39;n was the one holding the straws,&quot;
Asuka drawled, &quot;I wouldn&#39;y be surprised if she did rig
it.&quot;

On the bridge, Captain Misato Katsuragi sneezed
suddenly, jerking up from where she was napping.
Looking around in confusion the dark haired woman
shrugged then pulled her cap down over her eyes again
as she wet back to her nap.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter now,&quot; Rei noted as she pulled on
stockings, very aware of Asuka&#39;s hungry gaze on her
legs.

Asuka looked away, blushing. &quot;At least things have
quieted down after that last big push,&quot; she noted,
&quot;hopefully we won&#39;t see any big enemy action until
after the pageant.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Rei slipped her shoes on and stood.
Spining carefully in her heels she asked, &quot;How do I
look?&quot;

Clearing her throat nervously Asuka answered huskily,
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot;

Eyes twinkling with delight Rei answered, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;
She moved forward and bentv a bit to kiss Asuka
lingeringly a moment. Pulling back she smiled wryly
and murmured, &quot;Glad I didn&#39;t have my makeup on yet.&quot;

Blushing Asuka vowed, &quot;You don&#39;t need it.&quot;

In another section of the stadium in Macross city a
faintly blushing Miriya looked away as Min-Mei briskly
stripped off her waitress outfit, smoothly tossing it
over into a corner. Then she pulled her bra and
panties off and Miriya felt her pulse begin to race as
she tried not to notice the slim body standing before
her.

&#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; Mirya silently mused. She had
seen her fellow warriors naked before, there was
nothing unusual in all of this... yet somehow it was
different with Min-Mei standing there. Maybe it was
the kindness Min-Mei showed Miriya unconsciously,
without thinking about it for every moment of the day.
Whatever it was it made Miriya tingle a little as she
tried to gaze at Min-Mei as covertly as possible.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Min-Mei seemed oblivious to any
effect her nakedness was causing as she took the pale
pink party dress from where it sat by Miriya, &quot;I
thought about asking Shinji to come, but I thought the
poor boy&#39;d have a heart attack.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Miriya tried very hard not to look at Min-Mei&#39;s
small yet bouncy breasts as she grunted her agreement.

Slipping a fresh pair of pink panties on Min-Mei
fumbled with her bra strap before asking softly,
&quot;Miriya?&quot;

Gulping softly Miriya rose, her nose twitched at
Min-Mei&#39;s faint scent. With not too steady hands the
green haired young woman clipped the bra, thankful
that Min-Mei had showed her how to put something like
this on. &quot;Is that all right?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Min-Mei smiled sunnily, turning to pull
the readied party dress on. It seemed to float down
her body to settle into place, swirling around her
body like water. &quot;How did the dress turn out?&#39; she
asled Miriya anxiously.

&quot;You look,&quot; Miriya gulped, &quot;beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; and Min-Mei leaned forward to kiss her
cheek.

&#39;I should be concentrating on my task, defeating the
Micronian who bested me,&#39; Miriya mused dazedly as her
companion quickly returned to her preperations, &#39;so
why am I so caught up in these micronians lives?&#39;

Ritsuko Akagi strode up the hall to the door, the tall
blonde pausing as she heard her lover&#39;s voice raised
slightly. &quot;Yes Mother I know I should have told you,&quot;
Maya Ibuki said tiredly, &quot;but I wasn&#39;t seeing someone
until recently...&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Ritsuko quietly greeted her lover as the dark
haired woman paced the room, taking a seat and
listening curiously.

Maya waved as the younger woman in dress uniform
continued to talk, &quot;No, Mother, this isn&#39;t just a
temporary thing.&quot;

&quot;Telling the parents?&quot; Ritsuko said sympathetically.
When Maya nodded she continued, &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;

Making a undecided hand gesture Maya continued, &quot;This
is a very important relationship to me.&quot; She took a
deep breath and continued, &quot;In fact that&#39;s part of why
I called now... Ritsuko and I are getting married.&quot;

The shriek was loud enough that even Ritsuko could
hear it, and Maya jerked the phone away from her ear.
&quot;Are you...?&quot; Ritsuko moved towards her and waved her
off.

&quot;What was that Mom?&#39; Maya asked, blinking in surprise.
Her cheeks colored, &quot;We haven&#39;t really thought about
that yet... uh huh, uh huh... all right, I&#39;m sure the
Captain can arrange for you to be here. See you soon.&quot;

As Maya hung up Ritsuko asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;That wasn&#39;t quite what I expected,&quot; Maya shook her
head. &quot;Apparently Mom&#39;s known about me for years...&quot;

&quot;I noticed you almost as soon as you came aboard,&quot;
Ritsuko noted with a seductive smile, &quot;So I&#39;m not
surprised.&quot;

Maya blushed. &quot;Anyway,&quot; she said, &quot;she was disapointed
I hadn&#39;t told her sooner, but was pretty happy when I
told her about the wedding.&quot;

&quot;I heard,&quot; Ritsuko said wryly. She looked at Maya
curiously, &quot;What was it she asked that made you blush
that way?&quot;

&quot;I hoped you hadn&#39;t seen that,&quot; Maya muttered. She met
Ritsuko&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;She was wondering when we&#39;d
be giving her grandchildren.&quot;

Ritsuko&#39;s mouth dropped open but not a word came out.

Maya smiled, eyes twinkling merrily as she said,
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I just told her we hadn&#39;t talked about
it yet.&quot;

&quot;No, we haven&#39;t,&quot; Ritsuko admitted as she sat down
with a thump. Looking up at Maya she smiled slightly,
&quot;You know, I think you&#39;d be a good mother.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Maya quickly shook her head, &quot;I heard too
many unpleasant baby stories from Mom.&quot; Her tone
softened, &quot;Besides, I&#39;d rather have a daughter or son
that looked like you.&quot;

&quot;Charmer,&quot; Ritsuko chuckled. She squeezed Maya&#39;s hand,
&quot;We can talk about it later, too.&quot;

Clearly amused Maya continued, &quot;Better get ready for
the parental grilling, myt Mom and Dad have promised
to be here for the wedding.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d better have Misato arrange for a pilot to bring
them in,&quot; Ritsuko muttered, looking faintly worried.

&quot;Nervous?&#39; Maya asked after a moment.

&quot;It&#39;s not often I get asked to meet the parents,&quot;
Ritsuko confessed. &quot;What if I make a bad impression?&quot;
she fretted.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Maya took her hands, &quot;you have nothing to
worry about.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Ritsuko shook herself. &quot;And here I was
intending to support you today...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Maya chuckled.

Hugging Maya comfortingly she quietly asked her, &quot;Have
you decided what to do for the talent portion?&quot;

&quot;Dust off my rusty piano skills,&quot; Maya shrugged, &quot;and
hope I don&#39;t embarass myself too much.&quot;

&quot;You should wear a tuxedo,&quot; Ritsuko smirked, &quot;you look
so handsome in a suit you&#39;d win any female judge&#39;s
point.&quot;

&quot;Sempai!&quot; Maya scolded with a blush.</pre>
