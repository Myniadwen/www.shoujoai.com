<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
birds singing lustily from beyond her curtain-less window weren&#39;t what 
woke Asuka the next morning. Nor was it the fact that the quilt had 
slipped from the bed while they slept, exposing any unclothed parts 
of their bodies to the chill air. No, what woke Asuka was the fact that 
while they had been asleep they had changed positions, until Rei was 
no longer beside her. She was in fact draped partly across her, with 
Asuka on her back, Rei&#39;s head resting on her shoulder and her hand... 
resting on... her... LEFT... BREAST...</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
yelped and sat up quickly, tipping Rei over as she did so. This was 
more than enough to wake her new bedfellow and Rei looked dazedly up 
at Asuka, rubbing her sleepy eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka?&quot; 
she murmured, &quot;Is it time to get up?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ha 
ha ha!&quot; laughed Asuka, nervously, &quot;Yep, rise and shine, Wonder 
Girl. It&#39;s getting late, it&#39;s already gone...&quot; she glanced at her 
clock. &quot;Six o-clock!&quot; she cried, &quot;It&#39;s still the middle 
of the night!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
glance out of her window confirmed that the sky was not yet properly 
light. She flopped back on her pillow, groping around over the side 
of the bed with one hand for the escaped quilt so she could pull it 
back over her. Rei sat looking at her for a moment, then did the same. 
Happily for Asuka, she didn&#39;t resume her previous position, instead 
she retook the place she had originally occupied before they had gone 
to sleep the night before. Asuka pulled the quilt over Rei as well, 
then turned on her side to look at the blue haired girl, who was well 
on her way to falling asleep once again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She 
didn&#39;t do it on purpose, I&#39;m sure,</i> she thought to herself, <i>and 
besides, it&#39;s only natural for someone feeling lost and alone to cling 
to someone else when in close proximity</i>. <i>In fact, she probably 
doesn&#39;t even know she did it</i>...</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, 
that was true enough. But, thinking about it, wasn&#39;t Asuka&#39;s reaction 
stranger? Was she really so unused to physical contact that something 
as little as that had caused her to damn near suffer a panic attack? 
It hadn&#39;t used to have been a problem. When Kaji had been around, she&#39;d 
had no qualms about draping herself over him whenever she could. Shinji 
too, she hadn&#39;t had any difficulty kissing him that one time (though 
that didn&#39;t turn out so well in the end). Of course, since Nerv disappeared, 
she&#39;d been pretty much on her own and had perhaps become a bit of a 
recluse, which might explain the nervousness she&#39;d been encountering 
since Rei had turned up.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>That 
and fearing the end of the world was coming</i>...<i> again</i>, she 
thought. Then she giggled at how ridiculous that seemed now.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
opened her eyes and looked at her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
are you laughing about?&quot; she asked.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Self 
conscious are we, Wonder Girl?</i> thought Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh, 
nothing. I&#39;m laughing at myself, really.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Are 
you funny?&quot; asked Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ha! 
I suppose,&quot; replied Asuka, &quot;You should try laughing sometime. 
It&#39;s good for you.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It 
stimulates blood flow, it increases cell oxidation,&quot; stated Rei, 
as if she was reading from a text book. Then she stopped talking.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To 
Asuka&#39;s astonishment, Rei began forcing her face first into a smile, 
then into uncomfortable laughter.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ha 
ha ha,&quot; said Rei, then she stopped and her face returned to normal. 
&quot;I don&#39;t feel any different.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
of course you don&#39;t, baka! You can&#39;t laugh without feeling it inside. 
Laughing has to be natural.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Natural...&quot; 

echoed Rei and she closed her eyes again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yeah, 
natural,&quot; said Asuka, then she trailed off, thinking about this 
for a while. &quot;It&#39;s funny,&quot; she said, almost without realising 
she had started talking again, &quot;I&#39;d almost forgotten what laughing 
was like. It&#39;s been so long since I did it. Not that I really laughed 
that much at Nerv, I was always too busy trying to be superior and competing 
with you...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
glanced at Rei and saw that she was watching her again. Her red eyes 
looked impossibly deep in the slowly lightening room.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
never needed to compete with me,&quot; she said.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Didn&#39;t 
I?&quot; replied Asuka, heavily, &quot;I&#39;m not so sure. My life would 
have been completely empty without it...&quot; she sighed. &quot;Look, 
Rei, I think you&#39;ve got the wrong person. I can&#39;t tell you about life. 
I don&#39;t know about life, myself. All I know about is pain.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;There 
isn&#39;t anyone else,&quot; said Rei, a small frown on her features.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Isn&#39;t 
there?&quot; replied Asuka, &quot;Maya, Toji, Hikari, hell, some random 
person off the street... Anyone else would know more about life than 
me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
slowly sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees, staring away from 
Asuka at the end of the bed. Asuka lay on her back watching the girl. 
For a while they both remained quiet.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But...&quot; 

said Rei, eventually, &quot;I would not understand them...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Understand</i> 
them...?&quot; replied Asuka, frowning. Rei turned to her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka, 
you are a special person...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;No 
I&#39;m not!&quot; said Asuka, sudden anger growing in her (though not anger 
directed towards Rei), &quot;I spent ages trying to convince myself 
I was, but I&#39;m just not. I never was, everyone at Nerv knew it!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But 
Rei was shaking her head.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
were chosen by Shinji, you were the first to be brought back by him... 
You&#39;re special to Shinji, who created this world.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know if you noticed, Rei, but Shinji isn&#39;t exactly around. He 
can&#39;t love me, otherwise he&#39;d be here with me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
did not mean love...&quot; replied Rei, quietly, &quot;though if love 
exists, I am certain he loves you.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;If 
love exists...?&quot; said Asuka, her frown deepening.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know love...&quot; said Rei, in an even quieter voice.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Baka!&quot; 
Asuka almost shouted, &quot;Everyone loved you! Shinji loved you!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Shinji 
was afraid of me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Don&#39;t 
be stupid, Shinji was afraid of everyone, that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t 
love you. Besides, Misato loved you, too! Hell, even Gendo loved you 
in his own fucked up way!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked at Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
didn&#39;t...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly 
Asuka found herself blushing.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... 
well... I&#39;m not really... I mean...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
just looked sad and alone. Asuka couldn&#39;t help her heart going out to 
the young girl.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Look, 
Rei, I was an idiot back then. I probably still am. You don&#39;t want to 
worry about the things I said or thought.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But 
I did,&quot; replied Rei, &quot;I do. I... You...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
was struggling again, struggling with something larger than her. She 
could see the pain it caused the former pilot, clearly. It was too much 
for her. Asuka leapt forwards on the bed and wrapped her arms around 
the other girl.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh, 
Rei! I really hurt you, didn&#39;t I? I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she mumbled. Tears 
were starting in her eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
felt stiff in her arms. She made no move to stop Asuka, but then she 
also made no attempt to reciprocate the hug.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
is it?&quot; asked Asuka, pulling back a little.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... 
don&#39;t know how I should react in this situation,&quot; replied Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Baka!&quot; 
whispered Asuka, &quot;You&#39;re worse than Shinji.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
released Rei and sat back. She kept her head down, obscuring her face 
with her hair.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sorry,&quot; 

said Rei. And then she did something Asuka was not expecting. She began 
to cry. The tears seemed to astonish Rei as much as they did Asuka, 
for her eyes became wide and she looked down at the salt water that 
splashed onto her pyjamas, spreading gently across the fabric.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
crying again,&quot; she whispered, to herself more than to Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I 
never thought I&#39;d see that</i>...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei?&quot; 
whispered Asuka. The blue haired girl looked up at her with wide, damp 
eyes.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I... 
don&#39;t understand...&quot; said Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
don&#39;t have to,&quot; replied Asuka, and she lifted her arms, inviting 
Ayanami with soft eyes. Rei sat for a moment looking at the outstretched 
arms, then her face bunched and she moved forwards into Asuka&#39;s embrace. 
The red head wrapped her arms around her and lay back, bringing them 
gently back down onto the bed. Then she pulled the quilt back over them 
and simply lay there as Rei hitched and sobbed silently into her chest. 
Though her tears were quiet, they were full of the pent up misery that 
had been Rei&#39;s life, both growing up at Nerv and after Shinji had brought 
about Instrumentality, when she had returned to the world only to find 
herself more alone than ever.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka, 
too, was crying, though her tears did not match the intensity of Rei&#39;s. 
However, for what seemed like the first time, she found that the tears 
were not for herself, but for another. For Rei.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This 
is a time of firsts, it seems,</i> she thought to herself, but then 
decided it was probably a good thing. All of a sudden she found she <i>
wanted</i> to help Rei. It was important that Rei found happiness, if 
not the truth, and if that brought Asuka some kind of enlightenment 
along with it, then so much the better. And if not, well, she wouldn&#39;t 
have lost anything and would no doubt go on as she had been doing since 
coming to Kaibyaku. </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
cried for a long while and Asuka hushed and soothed her, stroking her 
back with her fingertips and smoothing her ruffled hair. At last, the 
sobs lessened, but she clung to Asuka nonetheless for a good deal longer. 
The German had begun to doze lightly when Rei looked up at last, rousing 
her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka, 
I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know... why I did that...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
smiled.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Like 
I said, you don&#39;t have to worry about feeling sad, or even understand 
it. If you need support, you should just ask for it.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;ve 
never asked before...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
you can from now on. Ask me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Should 
I... smile now?&quot; asked Rei. This question again surprised Asuka, 
but before she could come up with a response, Rei carried on. &quot;I 
think this is like the time that Shinji saved me. He told me to smile 
then...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
looked up at Asuka and her face lit up with the simplest, warmest smile 
that Asuka had ever seen on the young girl. As the morning sunlight 
finally spilled into her room, Rei looked nothing short of radiant.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You... 
look wonderful when you smile,&quot; whispered Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked startled, but then the smile returned with even greater strength.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thankyou, 
Asuka,&quot; she replied.</font> <br> <br></p>
