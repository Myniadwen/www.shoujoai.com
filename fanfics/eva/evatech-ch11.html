<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 11 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/evatech-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        The massive chamber stood in the center of the great ship, a 
technological marvel among many in the grand ship. The side of it opened 
and a figure emerged, dwarfed by the Zentradi around her. &quot;Are you well, 
commander?&quot; Breetai asked, his metal faceplate gleaming.

        Miriya looked up, taking a miniaturized garment and quickly 
pulling it on. &quot;As well as can be expected in this tiny form,&quot; the green 
haired woman frowned. She shook her head grimly, &quot;How do Micronians 
possibly stand it?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know,&quot; the attendant said to her 
sympathetically before asking, &quot;Do you feel any lingering ill effects?&quot;

        Miriya snarled, &quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot;

        &quot;Are you clear on your mission?&quot; Breetai asked with a slight 
frown.

        &quot;To infiltrate the Micronian city on board of Zor&#39;s ship,&quot; 
Miriya stood at attention while she said, &quot;and discover the weapons 
capabilities they are hiding.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;And I will find the 
pilot who defeated me in battle and kill him. Slowly....&#39;

        &quot;A Battlepod will carry you in,&quot; Breetai said gruffly, &quot;and 
launch your capsule into the hull of the vessel. From then on, you will 
be on your own.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m an Angel pilot,&quot; Miriya&#39;s voice was mildly chiding as she 
continued on, &quot;I will manage, and emerge from this triumphant.&quot;

        &quot;Understood,&quot; Breetai nodded then turned away, the giant 
striding off into the ship.

        Miriya climbed into the padded capsule, settling down while the 
end was sealed. &#39;I hope this works,&#39; she thought, letting her worry show 
in the privacy of this place. The next few hours were something of a 
blur.... The battle, weapon&#39;s fire outside the chamber, then a massive 
impact.

        &quot;Time to go,&quot; Miriya muttered to herself, picking herself up 
from where she fell. A bit of blood matted her hair, her scalp split by 
the crash.

        The pilot made her way from the ruptured container, emerging 
into the outer levels of Zor&#39;s ship. She looked out through a gap to the 
aerial combat outside, the blossoms of missile and weapons fire, the 
battlepods and Evangelion fighters in a maelstrom of fire and death. 
Turning resolutely she strode forward, seeking a route into the interior 
of the ship.

        The ship rocked occasionally as Miriya weaved her way inside, 
her rough garb pulled around her slim body. She emerged from a section 
of hull and shaded her eyes, the artificial blue sky and simulated sun 
high above them. &#39;A waist of time and technology,&#39; she noted while still 
feeling oddly... comforted by the illusion.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice asked as Miriya stumbled, 
distracted from her steps by the sight of males and females walking so 
closely together.

        Miriya quickly turned around, silently cursing her distraction 
as she took in the girl who had managed to sneak up behind her. Her dark 
hair was pulled up in a complicated looking bun, a long dress hugging 
her slim form as she gazed up at Miriya worriedly. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said 
curtly, &quot;I just had a bit of an accident.&quot;

        &quot;More than a bit,&quot; she reached out to where a slow trickle of 
blood dropped from Miriya&#39;s scalp, &quot;you&#39;ve been hurt.&quot; She grabbed at 
the startled Miriya&#39;s arm and tugged her after her, &quot;Let&#39;s get you some 
help.&quot;

        &quot;Who are you?&quot; Miriya blinked as the woman pulled her forward.

        &quot;Oh,&quot; she beamed up at the slightly taller Miriya, &quot;my name is 
Minmei.&quot;

        &quot;Miriya,&quot; she said, deciding to just let the woman pull her 
along. &#39;This could turn out to be useful,&#39; she thought.

        Not long afterward she was sitting inside a restaurant called 
&#39;Little White Dragon,&#39; an older woman bearing a resemblance to Minmei 
tending to her wound. &quot;Thank you, Auntie,&quot; Minmei said, looking 
worriedly over her shoulder at Miriya.

        The older woman gave Miriya a gentle smile, &quot;It looks like you 
had a rough time.&quot; She finished applying a bandage then gently tugged at 
the arm of Miriya&#39;s rough garment, &quot;Even your clothes are in bad shape.&quot;

        Miriya&#39;s thoughts raced, a story quickly forming in her mind. &quot;I 
don&#39;t remember,&quot; Miriya admitted, &quot;it&#39;s all sort of blurry.&quot;

        &quot;Do you have anywhere to stay?&quot; Minmei asked, looking down at 
her in concern.

        Miriya shrugged helplessly, &quot;I don&#39;t really know.&quot;

        Minmei looked appealingly towards her aunt, the older woman 
smiling back wryly. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve brought another lost kitten 
home,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll get the spare bedroom ready.&quot;

        Miriya looked surprised, &quot;You&#39;re letting me....&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s no trouble,&quot; Minmei beamed. A few moments her aunt came 
down to let them know and Minmei drew her upstairs, &quot;I like having 
people here.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Miriya said, seeing clothes laid out on the bed in the 
upstairs room. She touched the shirt and long pants thoughtfully, 
surprised at how nice they felt on her skin.

        &quot;My old boyfriend&#39;s clothes,&quot; Minmei said a bit apologetically, 
&quot;I told Auntie that you two were pretty close to the same size....&quot;

        Miriya picked up the red shirt thoughtfully before stripping off 
her roughly made Zentradi garb and pulling the clean clothes on. &quot;Is 
this the correct uniform?&quot; she asked Minmei curiously, tugging at the 
loosely fitting shirt.

        &quot;It&#39;s not a uniform,&quot; Minmei laughed, &quot;it&#39;s just clothes.&quot; She 
saw the white pants slip down Miriya&#39;s slim hips, the woman frantically 
grabbing at the waistband. &quot;I&#39;d better lend you a belt,&quot; she said, 
grabbing a black one.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Miriya sighed. With some assistance she threaded 
the belt through the loops, tightening the belt to keep the pants up.

        &quot;You really don&#39;t seem to know anything,&quot; Minmei murmured. She 
smiled sunnily, taking Miriya&#39;s hand, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll help you get 
your memory back.&quot;

        &quot;I hope so,&quot; Miriya smiled back. &#39;That improvisation was 
brilliant,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;it explains away all of my 
confusion.&#39; Minmei left her there to rest and Miriya lay back on the 
bed, a bit surprised at how comfortable it was compared to her usual 
quarters. &#39;Now if I can just find that damn pilot,&#39; Miriya mused.

        In another part of the ship two women walked side by side, 
talking softly. &quot;I can understand your being nervous,&quot; Ritsuko said with 
a gentle smile, &quot;I&#39;m feeling it, too.&quot;

        &quot;Really?&quot; Maya looked up at the tall blonde in surprise.

        Ritsuko laughed softly, reaching out to take her black haired 
lover&#39;s hand. &quot;It&#39;s a big step we&#39;re taking,&quot; she said, &quot;I may be sure 
of you but myself? I&#39;m a mass of confusion.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve always been sure of you, Sempai,&quot; Maya squeezed Ritsuko&#39;s 
hand.

        Ritsuko chuckled softly, looking down at her with a sultry look. 
&quot;You really should be careful about calling me that,&quot; she purred, &quot;you 
never know what might happen.&quot;

        Maya gulped, a bit of a flush appearing on her face. &quot;And what 
might that be?&quot; she managed to squeak out.

        The two women stopped near an intersection, Ritsuko gently 
tilting Maya&#39;s face up with a finger. &quot;I might have to take you back to 
our quarters,&quot; she whispered, &quot;and....&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re on duty,&quot; Maya squealed.

        Rei looked as Ritsuko chased a blushing Maya by them, the two 
women disappearing in the distance. &quot;Thank god they didn&#39;t see us,&quot; 
Shinji noted mildly.

        &quot;That was sort of cute,&quot; Rei noted, a slight blush on her pale 
cheeks.

        Asuka chuckled wickedly, &quot;I almost wish they had gone through 
with whatever they were going to do in the hallway.&quot;

        &quot;Asuka,&quot; Rei scolded, blushing brighter.

        Asuka carried her helmet over her shoulder as the three flight 
suit garbed pilots started off again. &quot;Do you two want to hit the town 
with me for dinner?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Gotta pass,&quot; Shinji looked a bit sheepish, &quot;the last call I got 
from Minmei sounded like she was feeling a bit neglected. I thought I&#39;d 
take her out for dinner.&quot;

        &quot;Bring a present too,&quot; Asuka reminded him, &quot;she likes that sort 
of thing.&quot; She looked over at Rei, &quot;How about it?&quot;

        Rei looked at Asuka a moment, her little tongue poking out to 
moisten suddenly dry lips. &quot;I&#39;d love too,&quot; she smiled.</pre>
