<h1>A Simple Girl's Silence (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ancientrime.html">Ancient Rime</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rei Ayanami did not consider herself beautiful, nor did she believe 
that she was the best at anything. She had spent most of her time in 
silence, saying no more and no less than what was completely 
necessary. She was oblivious at times that she was actually unaware 
that no one could quite relate to her. And, so she stood, staring 
outside the window. Things of nature often calmed her, most 
specifically water. She considered it to be &quot;agreeable.&quot; 

Tugging uncomfortably on her bandages, Rei paid little attention to 
the aging history teacher at the head of the class rambling on about 
the 2nd Impact. No, the thoughts of Rei Ayanami were elsewhere, 
somewhere searching the endless blue sky for answers to her questions. 
She wanted to understand her dreams, but who could she talk to really? 
There was Major Katsuragi, but she was an adult. Could she really 
understand Rei? Her mind wandered to the image of Shinji, who seemed 
caught up in his own inner turmoil, suffering and weak. No, he might 
understand, but he could not help. Rei needed someone strong, someone 
brave. Commander Ikari, he was too busy to be bothered. He could not 
understand his own son, so Rei assumed that there was no hope of him 
understanding her. Indeed, she had abandoned that fantasy long ago. 
She barely knew Dr. Akagi. That left only one person to her knowledge; 
the pilot of Unit 02, Asuka Langley Soryu. 

Rei had shocked herself. How could Asuka, of all people, understand 
her? What had even drawn her attention to her in the first place? Rei 
had always seemed to harbor some sort of affection for Asuka, no 
matter how loud, unkind and cruel the redheaded German was to her. She 
had often taken time to wonder why Asuka insisted upon being as brassy 
as her hair, but she had never made an issue of it and never would. 
She had her own questions to answer, she had no time to consider Asuka 
any longer. At least, that&#39;s what she would have liked to assume. Rei 
needed Asuka now. How in the name of God was she to explain that to 
her? That thought was disturbed. The bell rang, and Class A headed for 
the gym lockers. 

It took Rei little time to change. She paused, looking at her pale 
reflection in the mirror pinned up in her locker. She could faintly 
see the reflection of someone else who was not quite her, and yet was. 
She combed her hand through her light blue hair, and blinked her 
almost red eyes. For a fleeting moment, she found herself possibly 
attractive. Her content gaze was interrupted by the sudden loud 
chattering that deluged the once silent girls locker room. Over all of 
those voice, Rei could hear Asuka&#39;s the loudest. 

&quot;So, Hikari, How about that party next week? Who are ya bring? Hm?&quot; 

&quot;No one. Do I really need to bring anyone, Asuka?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m bringing Kaji!&quot; 

There could be a sweet whimsical sigh heard from Asuka, who was on the 
other side of the lockers with Hikari. Oh boy, here we go again. Rei 
tried her hardest to stare into the mirror and not hear Asuka at all. 
Hearing Asuka ramble on and on into infinity about how incredible Kaji 
was upset Rei, for reasons she couldn&#39;t understand. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m gonna drag Ayanami along. How about it? Is that okay 
Hikari?&quot; 

A long pause ensued. Hikari could not believe her very ears. Had Asuka 
actually said something nice about the alleged &quot;Wonder Girl&quot;? 

&quot;No, not at all! I&#39;d love to have her come with us. She needs to open 
up. I bet she&#39;s very nice! But... Why do you care about her so much 
all of a sudden Asuka?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not so much that I care Hikari...&quot; It was possible to hear Asuka
sigh, and pause before she reluctantly continued. 

&quot;Look, I can&#39;t explain it okay? Can we drop the whole thing?&quot; 

&quot;Yea... I guess so Asuka.&quot; 

The entire gym period went by so slowly that Rei sometimes questioned 
whether she was moving at the speed of light, or time was just 
sluggish these days. Finally, the dismisal bells rang, and Rei went on 
her way. She paid little attention to anything, and was more caught up 
in her thoughts than usual. School troubled her, and not because of 
the work; but because it often forced her to interact with others, 
bring about more questions. Rei was away from the school now. She 
traveled to the most isolated edges of Tokyo 3, those parts of it that 
weren&#39;t scraped by fire. There were no lights, no disturbing noise. 
Rei had time to think now. She watched the sun setting. It painted the 
sky red; the color that she hated.
