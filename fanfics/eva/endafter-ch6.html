<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Progress. 
That was what she was making: progress. Rei was finally opening up and 
it had taken a lot less than Asuka would have ever expected.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Or 
at least that was how it had seemed that morning. By lunch time however, 
Rei was back to her usual monosyllabic self. Not that Asuka minded especially. 
She was sure that what had gone on since their reunion wasn&#39;t washing 
over Rei without effect. Little differences were already creeping into 
her mannerisms. For example, after rising late (it being Sunday and 
there being no work for Asuka to go to) they discovered the coffee utensils 
that had been used and not cleared away the night before. Asuka had 
decided (or rather, her growling stomach had decided) that food was 
more important, as they each hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast on the previous 
day. For some reason, eating had completely slipped her mind...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
had then offered to clear up while Asuka prepared the food. That was 
the first minor difference, but also the way she had offered wasn&#39;t 
normal Rei. Where she would normally ask for mere confirmation of her 
duties, i.e. &quot;should I clear this up?&quot; she had instead sought 
an emotional response from Asuka: &quot;would you like me to clear this 
up?&quot; A small thing, maybe, but something that Asuka picked up on, 
nevertheless.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Of 
course, she remained completely silent whilst completing the task, but 
that wasn&#39;t anything Asuka hadn&#39;t already become accustomed to. In fact, 
in a way it was quite comforting...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
young redhead made sandwiches for each of them, since cooking felt a 
little too involved for the time of day. They ate them, mainly in silence, 
seated at the kotatsu as they had been the night before. Asuka couldn&#39;t 
help watching Rei as she ate, waves of surreal wonder kept rolling over 
her. It was almost unbelievable that the blue haired girl was seated 
before her at all.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>How 
did she come back?</i> wondered the redhead. <i>Did she choose to leave 
the lcl, like I did?</i></font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thinking 
back to the Instrumentality was not something she liked to do. Shinji 
may have allowed the world to continue, but it was Asuka who had chosen 
to leave the sea of souls. Remembering all the human entities crowded 
together, touching every part of her psyche, seeing everyone and being 
seen by everyone, losing the borders of her self... it was an experience 
the German had found horrifying. Had Rei&#39;s experience been the same 
as hers? Was that why she had come back?</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
wanted to ask, but at the same time, she didn&#39;t think she had the strength 
or courage to talk about those things herself. Instead, she remained 
uncharacteristically quiet, even as she collected up their utensils 
and returned them to the kitchen, leaving Rei seated meekly at the Kotatsu.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When 
she passed through the entrance hall once more, Asuka noticed that the 
light on her answering machine was flashing. It must have been flashing 
since the previous day, but what with Rei&#39;s dramatic arrival, it had 
totally failed to register. She strode over to the phone and hit &#39;play 
message&#39;, already knowing who it would be before she depressed the plastic 
button.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka?&quot; 
said the slightly digitalised female voice, &quot;It&#39;s Maya...&quot; 

there was a pause, &quot;I guess you&#39;re out. I hope you&#39;ve not just 
stopped answering your phone... Anyway, I thought we could meet up tomorrow 
or some time this week. I haven&#39;t seen or heard from you for a few weeks 
and I&#39;m starting to get a bit worried. If you&#39;re bothered by how I was 
last time, I&#39;m doing better now, I&#39;ve laid off the alcohol a bit. Are 
you still touring cafés?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
was another pause in which Asuka felt chagrin.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sorry, 
I guess I should have told you I know about that. I&#39;ve seen you on more 
than one occasion, what with being in the delivery business now. Anyway, 
give me a call. I really want to see you, to make sure you&#39;re all right... 
You&#39;re the only one that&#39;s...&quot; a third pause followed, the longest 
yet, then Maya finished. &quot;Well, call me...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
line clicked on the recording and then the answer phone informed her 
that there were no further messages.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Lieutenant 
Ibuki...&quot; said a voice from behind her. Asuka jumped and looked 
round. Rei was standing in the doorway to the living area, her expression 
unreadable.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yeah,&quot; 
replied Asuka, &quot;She&#39;s been having a hard time since... well, you 
know. I think she had a thing for Doctor... for Ritsuko.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
supposed she would probably always remember the people that had died 
in Nerv by their rank or title. It was something that she would never 
get past.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;That 
woman tried to kill me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Maya?!&quot; 
gasped Asuka. Rei shook her head. &quot;Ritsuko...&quot; finished the 
young German, suddenly understanding. And she thought she had vague 
recollections of what Rei was talking about, of red liquid and the edges 
of a white lab coat being tugged at by small currents. Another gift 
from the mind of Shinji... or was this from Rei herself?</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
made her sad. I made her mother sad... Now I&#39;ve made Maya sad...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Don&#39;t 
say that!&quot; cried Asuka. She lunged forward and grabbed the startled 
Rei, pulling her into an embrace. &quot;We&#39;re all partly responsibility 
for what happened, it&#39;s not just your fault!&quot; she whispered fiercely, 
tears stinging the backs of her eyes, &quot;Stop blaming yourself for 
everything, or you&#39;ll get me started, too!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
smiled faintly and relaxed into the hug, putting her own arms around 
Asuka. She rested her cheek on the redhead&#39;s shoulder.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Holding 
you feels nice,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I never –&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
let go of her quickly, leaving Rei looking slightly disappointed.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s 
called hugging,&quot; replied the German, breezily. &quot;If you want 
to know what it is to live, you&#39;re going to have to start using correct 
terms for things like that. Otherwise, you&#39;ll start causing all sorts 
of uncomfortable misunderstandings...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In 
truth, though, they hadn&#39;t just been hugging. Asuka had let go so quickly 
because Rei had been right; it <i>had</i> felt nice... Asuka wasn&#39;t 
used to that yet.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Some 
teacher I&#39;m going to be</i>...</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
turned back to the phone.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
I better give her a call, I suppose,&quot; she said, picking up the 
receiver. She glanced at Rei. &quot;I do have big news, after all...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
punched Maya&#39;s number into the handset without pause. It came quickly 
to her mind; in truth it was one of only a very few telephone numbers 
Asuka had to remember since coming to Kaibyaku: Maya; the foreman at 
work; her landlord; a couple of her colleagues that had tried (and mostly 
failed) to form a friendly relationship with her outside of work... 
And that was it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
line buzzed eight times, a long time for Maya. Asuka was just expecting 
the answering machine to pick up, but then the former lieutenant appeared 
on the line.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hello, 
sorry, hello!&quot; Maya sounded out of breath, &quot;Sorry, I was in 
the bathroom.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Too 
much information, as usual, lieutenant,&quot; said the German.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka? 
I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear from you!&quot; said Maya, sounding surprised.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
told me to call,&quot; replied Asuka, frowning.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ah, 
that&#39;s right,&quot; replied Maya, &quot;but since you hadn&#39;t spoken 
to me for ages, I wasn&#39;t sure... Well, anyway, are you all right? I&#39;ve 
been worried about you, you know? I hope you don&#39;t hate me for the café 
thing, it&#39;s just –&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Maya,&quot; 
Asuka broke in, &quot;it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been so closed off 
recently.&quot; 
She glanced at Rei, who was standing, looking a little awkward, in the 
kitchen doorway. &quot;Look, Maya, can we meet up today... I have to 
talk to you about something...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sure...&quot; 
answered Maya, sounding anything but, &quot;there&#39;s nothing wrong, is 
there?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh, 
no. Nothing like that.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Okay, 
well, where would you like to meet? That café down on –&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
think it would be best if we were somewhere private, rather than somewhere 
with lots of people. How about you come over to mine? I&#39;ve got some 
new coffee which is really good.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
really worrying me now,&quot; said Maya, &quot;this isn&#39;t about that 
time I was drunk and tried to kiss you, is it? I said I was sorry, I 
thought you&#39;d taken that as –&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;B-Baka!&quot; 
stammered Asuka, blushing at that memory, &quot;What are you bringing 
that up for? Maya, would you quit worrying. I said it wasn&#39;t anything 
bad!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Okay...&quot; 
replied Maya, slowly, &quot;You have coffee, you say? Then how about 
I bring some groceries and cook us dinner?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sounds 
good,&quot; smiled Asuka, &quot;but just one thing: bring lots.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Okay,&quot; 
replied Maya, sounding more confused than ever.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;See 
you around seven, say?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sure,&quot; 
said Maya, &quot;see you at seven.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
hung up and heaved a sigh.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Is 
Maya coming?&quot; the voice of Rei sounded from across the hallway. 
Asuka looked up and smiled.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;She 
said she would. But this place is a mess, I haven&#39;t cleaned properly 
in ages. Want to help me straighten everything up before she gets here?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
considered this for a moment, then nodded.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
would... like that.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
smiled at her new room-mate, who still stood a little awkwardly, staring 
back at her with that usual neutral expression. Sudden energy filled 
her.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Right! 
We&#39;ve got a little more than five hours before Ibuki will be here, we&#39;d 
best get started!&quot;</font> <br> <br></p>
