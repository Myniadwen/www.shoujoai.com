<h1>Third Genesis (part 33 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>Ritsuko Akagi&#39;s fingers flew across the keyboard, the
older woman&#39;s eyes flicking from screen to screen as
she typed. &quot;Maya,&quot; she said casually as she typed, &quot;do
you prefer me as a blonde, or should I let my natural
color grow back in?&quot;

&quot;I would like you with blonde or brown hair,&quot; Maya
Ibuki shrugged from where she was working at her own
computer nearby. The dark brown haired woman looked
over at Ritsuko, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

Ritsuko smiled slightly, &quot;I began coloring my hair for
various reasons, and I&#39;m undecided if I should stop.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Maya agreed.

Both women were well aware of why Ritsuko had begun
changing her hair color, as direct result of the
illicit relationship between Ritsuko and Gendo. The
older man had taken advantage of Ritsuko, using her to
his advantage in his schemes and even compelling her
to commit illegal acts. Even worse he had attempted to
reshape her into a copy of Yui, including the coloring
of her hair.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Ritsuko changed the subject, &quot;I&#39;m glad our
pre-wedding talk with your parents went well.&quot;

Maya coughed slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t know about well,&quot; she
laughed.

&quot;But I thought that every girl&#39;s parents wanted her to
marry a successful doctor?&quot; Ritsuko teased Maya
gently.

&quot;I think they&#39;d prefer a male doctor,&quot; Maya laughed.
She looked thoughtful, &quot;Though I noticed my mother
seems to be getting over her surprise quickly.&quot;

&quot;You think they suspected something earlier?&quot; Ritsuko
raised a eyebrow.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Maya admitted, &quot;I did have
a few... strong crusjed on other girls when I was
younger.&quot;

Ritsuko grinned, &quot;Your mom told me about you, you
know.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Maya looked wary.

&quot;Apparently you were very protective of the
neighborhood girls,&quot; Ritsuko looked impish, &quot;they even
called you big brother.&quot;

Maya blushed, &quot;I was just...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Ritsuko squeezed her hand, &quot;I thought
it was cute.&quot;

&quot;Would you two stop that?&#39; Yui sounded amused as she
entered the work area to find the two of them staring
lovingly into each other&#39;s eyes. It was even odder
when considering that the woman&#39;s persona was within
the body of teenaged boy Shinji Ikari.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Maya nearly jumped, blushing sweetly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ritsuko took the papers Yui handed her. &quot;So
how&#39;s the feedback analysis going?&quot; she asked
seriously.

&quot;I think we&#39;ve nailed down the channels in which the
feedback is at it&#39;s worst,&quot; Yui revealed, &quot;but how to
mute the sensor data in the Archangels is still
unknown.&quot;

&quot;Before we got distracted,&quot; Maya blushed again, &quot;Dr.
Akagi and I were programing a series of &#145;virtual
blocks&#39; to instal in the system. They might be enough
to deaden the overloading sensory imput.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; Yui conceded after a moment.

&quot;And have you had any luck with figuring out how
Shinji and you were switched?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Yui flashed a smile, &quot;the Magi and I have
a working theory, based on my recollections on what it
SHOULD have been and how Gendo twisted it.&quot;

&quot;Which is?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;A near miss,&quot; Yui said, &quot;Gendo implemented some kind
of program to get me out of Unit-01 and into a clone
body, maybe based on homing in on my DNA. Sadly I
locked onto Shinji rather than the clone and...&quot;

&quot;You and Shinji switched,&quot; Ritsuko nodded. She tapped
a finger on her desk, &quot;You might want to tell Misato,
as well as ask her about looking into Gendo&#39;s private
files. If it was his program, you might find it
there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Yui smiled as she turned and hurried
out of the room.

&quot;You look disturbed,&quot; Maya noted once Yui had left.

Ritsuko sighed softly. &quot;I&#39;m just praying that my
sabotaging the Magi to try and stop Instrumentality
didn&#39;t accidentally cause this,&quot; she explained.

&quot;Even if you did it&#39;s Gendo&#39;s schemes that caused Yui
to be in Shinji&#39;s body,&quot; Maya insisted, &quot;not you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, love,&quot; Ritsuko smiled.

Meanwhile, Asuka Soryu Langley brough her Evangelion&#39;s
rifle up, the redhead taking aim through her one eye,
a eye patch covering her left eye. &quot;Cover my left,&quot;
she ordered, &quot;and let&#39;s take this thing.&quot;

With a cool but eager voice Rei answered, &quot;Yes,
Asuka.&quot; The blue haired girl advanced with Asuka,
weapons blazing as they destroyed a false Angel, then
moved on through the simulated city of Tokyo-3.

&quot;You really enjoy this, don&#39;t you?&#39; Asuka asked as she
warily peeked around a building, her red plugsuit
hugging her body.

Dressed in a similar plugsuit, but colored in blue
with lighter highlights, Rei was relaxed but steady at
the controls of her Evangelion. &quot;I enjoy working with
you,&quot; Rei answered calmly as they combined their fire
against another Angel.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Asuka smiled.

In the control room Aoba Kinushima watched the ongoing
fight, her short brown hair falling into her eyes in a
rakish sort of way. &quot;Those two are pretty deadly,&quot; the
NERV unarmed combat instructor admitted.

Misato Katsuragi nodded her agreement, her almost
purple-black hair falling in a wabve from her face.
For once she was in a variation of her uniform, the
grey NERV official wear, rather than her usual dress
and jacket with her rank insignia pinned on. &quot;They&#39;re
very good on their own,&quot; she said, &quot;but together
they&#39;re lethal.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Aoba asked with a smile, &quot;what do you need me
for?&quot;

Misato flashed a grin, &quot;There&#39;s always room for
improvement.&quot; As Aoba chuckled softly she added,
&quot;Besides, I&#39;ve noticed Rei tends to lack a... you
could call it a killer instinct, maybe. I&#39;m hoping
teaching her unarmed combat might help with that.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; another smile quirked at Aoba&#39;s lips as she
said, &quot;the first time Rei managed a judo throw, she
stopped to apologize to Asuka.&quot;

Misato snickered, &quot;I could see that.&quot;

They watched as Asuka and Rei progressed through the
virtual city, using simulated reloading points to
stock up their guns as they sustematically mowed down
any opposition. &quot;And the progressive knife?&quot; Aoba
asked.

&quot;I would like to see them get some knife training,&quot;
Misato admitted, &quot;they&#39;re good at it, but as a
fallback weapon the knife&#39;s got disadvantages.&quot;

&quot;Have you ever thought of designing a progressive
sword?&quot; Aoba mused.

Misato smiled wryly, &quot;Maya&#39;s people are working on
something like that for the Archangel, as well as a
chainsaw weapon that looks like a prop from a horror
movie.&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Aoba blinked.

&quot;Twin blades from a oversized base,&quot; Misato described
it with her gestures, &quot;I figure someone on her tech
team saw &#145;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#39; too many times.&quot;

Aoba laughed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want a weapon like
that, you&#39;d hurt yourself.&quot;

&quot;And isn&#39;t THAT a scary image,&quot; Misato gestured,
&quot;whoops, Rei, there goes your arm! Look out!&quot;

Yui blinked as she walking in the control room to kind
two grown women making chainsaw noises and laughing
uncontrollably. &quot;Should I come back later?&quot; she asked
mildly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Aoba wiped at her eyes.

&quot;Got a bit carried away,&quot; Misato said apologetically.
&quot;Have you had lunch yet?&quot; she asked them both
politely.

&quot;No, not yet,&quot; Yui agreed. She nodded to where Rei and
Asuka were double teaming another Angel, &quot;Shall we
take them from their play?&quot;

&quot;Guess we&#39;ll have to interupt,&quot; Aoba smiled slightly.

&quot;We&#39;re heading out for lunch,&quot; Misato used the
intercom to contact the girls, &quot;would you care to join
us?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Asuka said.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Rei agreed.

&quot;Meet you at the locker rooms, then,&quot; Misato nodded
firmly.

To be continued...

Notes: Had a few readers ask why Ritsuko is blonde
while not dating Gendo, so I thought I&#39;d address that.
Also, the chainsaw weapon really DOES exist, and
appears in the official Evangelion PS2 game. See it
and weep.</pre>
