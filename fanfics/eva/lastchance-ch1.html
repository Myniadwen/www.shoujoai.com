<h1>A Last Change for Happiness</h1>

<pre>Ritsuko Akagi finished the last of her drink and quickly ordered 
another. It was shaping up to be that sort of night. As the barman was 
fetching it, Ritsuko took a look around the bar. There was still no sign 
of her. She hoped she had the right place &#150; the other two bridge techs 
were sure that she usually came here. It had taken a bit of subtle 
questioning, but Ritsuko had eventually gotten the information she 
needed without arousing too much suspicion. It was a small bar outside 
Tokyo-3 &#150; it had escaped the widespread destruction of Unit-00, and was 
still open. That wasn&#39;t too surprising, thought Ritsuko. If there was 
one thing people usually did after such events, it was drink.

Her drink arrived and she took a large gulp from it. This was her third 
of the evening so far. If she wasn&#39;t careful, she was going to end up 
just like Misato.

Misato. The name flittered around the inside of her head as the image of 
her long-time friend came up. She had not been herself lately. Ritsuko 
had a heavy suspicion that she knew the reason for that, but she 
couldn&#39;t bring herself to think about that right now. One more thing and 
she really was going to fall apart.

Of course, everyone was falling apart now, it seemed. Asuka&#39;s synch 
ratio was next to nothing now and she was all but useless. Misato was 
keeping up a tough front, but she was clearly suffering inside. Shinji 
had never been very well-adjusted, but now he was retreating even 
further into himself. Rei...

Rei had died. She was dead.

Dead. The word had a sense of finality about it &#150; normally. Of course, 
with Rei, death was anything but. Just take another one from the box and 
you were as right as rain. No need to grieve. No need for anyone to be 
inconvenienced &#150; especially the commander. Just thinking about him made 
Ritsuko sick to her stomach. Of course he would make sure that Rei would 
always be there. If anyone else died, he wouldn&#39;t bat an eyelid. Rei was 
special; Rei was all he cared about.

Ritsuko was starting to think that perhaps she wasn&#39;t quite as important 
to the commander as Rei was, even considering their...relationship. She 
prayed she was wrong, but somehow she doubted it. The thought made her 
shiver and she took another huge gulp of her drink.

Setting it down, she lit a cigarette. That always calmed her. As she did 
so, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. &quot;How,&quot; she asked 
quietly to herself, &quot;did you end up doing everything you said &#150; you 
swore &#150; that you would never do? Tell me that, please.&quot;

Before she could think up an answer (if she even had one), a familiar 
voice cut into her thoughts. &quot;Sempai?&quot;

Ritsuko turned to see Maya Ibuki, out of uniform and dressed in a black 
t-shirt and jeans, was standing beside her chair, a slightly confused 
look on her face. &quot;I thought it was you.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Maya.&quot; Ritsuko smiled. &quot;How are you?&quot;

&quot;Good, thank you, Sempai,&quot; said Maya, frowning a little. &quot;I don&#39;t 
usually see you here.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;Ritsuko paused for a second. &quot;I just needed to get out of NERV 
for a while, especially after today.&quot;

Maya&#39;s face fell. &quot;I know what you mean. It was horrible...I can&#39;t...&quot; 
She tailed off, clearly distressed at the memories. Maya was so gentle 
and fragile. Ritsuko often wondered why she had come to work for NERV in 
the first place. It wasn&#39;t a place for a normal person. It never had 
been.

&quot;I know,&quot; said Ritsuko softly. &quot;I have to be honest...I knew you were 
coming here tonight.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Maya frowned. &quot;I mean, I...&quot; She paused. &quot;Oh. Makoto and Aoba, 
right?&quot;

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind.&quot; Ritsuko took a drag of her cigarette. &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to get you angry &#150; I know you have a terrible temper.&quot;

Maya blushed a little. &quot;You&#39;re teasing me, Sempai. No...I don&#39;t mind. I 
don&#39;t usually see you after work.&quot; Her blush deepened. &quot;It&#39;s...you look 
nice tonight.&quot;

Ritsuko glanced at herself in the mirror. She was simply wearing shorts 
and a blue t-shirt, a white shirt draped over her shoulders. It was what 
she normally wore after work. &quot;It&#39;s nothing special.&quot;

&quot;It...it suits you.&quot; Maya couldn&#39;t meet her gaze fully. Obviously seeing 
Ritsuko in the bar, and knowing that she had maybe come here to see Maya 
especially, was making her unusually bold tonight. However, she was 
still blushing furiously.

Maya&#39;s crush on her Sempai had been obvious for a long time to everyone 
in NERV, Ritsuko especially. It had always made her a little nervous &#150; 
Maya was such a sweet girl, but she was not the most self-confident of 
people. Ritsuko was always afraid that she would inadvertently say 
something and crush the poor girl&#39;s feelings forever. Of course, 
tonight&#39;s plan could do that too, but Ritsuko knew she had to go through 
with it.

Always so selfish, she thought to herself. It doesn&#39;t matter who else 
gets hurt as long as you get what you want. Isn&#39;t that what HE does? No 
wonder you got together. So much like each other.

&quot;Sempai?&quot; It was Maya, the blush gone, a look of concern on her face. 
&quot;You looked like you zoned out there for a moment.&quot;

Ritsuko smiled weakly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Maya. It&#39;s been a rough day.&quot;

Maya&#39;s expression said it all. &quot;I know,&quot; she said quietly. There was a 
brief silence, before: &quot;Sempai?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You...you said that you knew I was coming here tonight. Did 
you...did...?&quot; She was badly stammering. &quot;I mean...&quot;

&quot;Yes, Maya - I came here to see you.&quot;

Maya&#39;s face lit up and she beamed. &quot;Really?&quot;

Ritsuko nodded. &quot;That&#39;s why I asked the other two bridge officers where 
you might be going. I wanted to see you.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; If Maya&#39;s grin could have gotten any wider, it would have 
swallowed the rest of her face. The look of such eager and naked joy 
almost broke Ritsuko&#39;s heart. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking...why?&quot;

Ritsuko finished her cigarette and took another gulp of her drink. &quot;It 
was a rough day today. I needed to see a friendly face. I just needed 
some friendly companionship for a while.&quot; She set her glass down and 
looked at Maya. &quot;So why are you here?&quot;

&quot;I always come here.&quot; Maya shrugged. &quot;After work, it&#39;s usually pretty 
late...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s usually my fault,&quot; deadpanned Ritsuko.

Maya smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t mind. But it&#39;s usually pretty late, and I&#39;m always 
pretty buzzed still, so I usually come here for a drink to relax me 
before I go home.&quot; She looked around at the teeming crowds. &quot;It&#39;s 
usually a lot quieter, though.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t really imagine you in a loud nightclub, no.&quot; Ritsuko lit 
another cigarette, ignoring Maya&#39;s disapproving glance. She knew Maya 
didn&#39;t approve, but she was always too timid to say anything. &quot;So, 
there&#39;s no-one to go home to?&quot;

Maya blushed furiously. &quot;No...you know that.&quot; It was true &#150; Maya had 
always been very upfront about her lack of recent partners. Ritsuko 
suspected that she was doing that to subtly let Ritsuko know that she 
was free. The poor girl was terribly besotted &#150; she obviously had awful 
taste in women.

&quot;That&#39;s a shame,&quot; said Ritsuko lightly. &quot;Still, I suppose NERV takes up 
a lot of your time.&quot;

&quot;Yes. But I don&#39;t mind. Plus, it&#39;s nowhere near as much time as you 
spend there.&quot; Maya paused and looked down nervously. &quot;It&#39;s a...little 
surprising to see you out. You&#39;re usually in much later.&quot;

&quot;They can survive without me for a night. I hope.&quot; Ritsuko took another 
drag of her cigarette and downed the last of her drink. &quot;Can I buy you a 
drink?&quot;

Maya nodded and gave her order to the barman, as did Ritsuko. After a 
minute, he returned with them. Ritsuko stood up. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;To a booth.&quot; Ritsuko indicated one. &quot;I don&#39;t want to sit at the bar. A 
booth is more private.&quot; Naturally, Maya blushed at that, causing Ritsuko 
to sigh to herself. Of course Maya would have taken that the wrong way.

They walked to a nearby booth and sat down, Ritsuko grabbing an ashtray 
from the nearest table before she did so. Noting Maya&#39;s look, she smiled 
a little. &quot;Maya, if you don&#39;t like my smoking, why don&#39;t you ever say 
anything?&quot;

Maya flushed and looked away. &quot;It&#39;s none of my business,&quot; she said 
nervously. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...I...I shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;No, come on. Let&#39;s be honest tonight. Tell me how you really feel.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Maya hesitantly. &quot;I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s bad for you. I 
wouldn&#39;t mind it so much if you only had a few, but you smoke all day 
long! I mean, you have to smoke at least a pack a day and that&#39;s just 
when I&#39;m there!&quot; She realized her voice had gotten a little loud and 
stopped, embarrassed.

&quot;It relaxes me,&quot; said Ritsuko, taking another drag. &quot;God knows I&#39;m under 
enough stress when I&#39;m there.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re killing yourself,&quot; said Maya unhappily. &quot;I mean, I just 
wish...&quot;

&quot;That I&#39;d stop?&quot; Ritsuko looked at her. &quot;Why do you care so much?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Maya was taken aback by the question. &quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so worked up about my health. Why?&quot;

&quot;Sempai...&quot; Maya was at a loss for words.

&quot;I&#39;m your boss, Maya. I doubt you care about the Commander or the Major 
that much.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re different!&quot; interrupted Maya. &quot;You&#39;re more than just my 
boss! You&#39;re my mentor &#150; someone I look up to, someone I admire, 
someone...&quot; She tailed off, clearly embarrassed at her outburst.

Ritsuko looked down at the table. She picked up her drink and took 
another large gulp. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I live up to your inflated opinion of 
me, Maya.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Sempai.&quot;

&quot;Why not? Maya, you know what we do at NERV. You know more than most &#150; 
you know what the dummy plug actually is &#150; you know what we did this 
afternoon with Rei.&quot; The last name stuck in her throat. She felt sick.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t like that,&quot; said Maya slowly, choosing her words carefully. 
&quot;But I know that we&#39;re doing this to save the world. If we didn&#39;t do 
anything, the Angels would destroy us. And we&#39;re ordered to do it &#150; I 
know that sometimes you hate it as much as I do. But we have to do what 
we&#39;re told.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you joined NERV, Maya? To save the world?&quot; Ritsuko tried 
not to let her tone become bitter, but it didn&#39;t really work. 
&quot;Sometimes...sometimes I wonder if it&#39;s worth it.&quot; She took another 
drink and sighed heavily.

&quot;I think it&#39;s worth it!&quot; Maya sounded indignant. &quot;There&#39;s so much in the 
world that&#39;s wonderful, and...&quot; She noticed Ritsuko smiling sadly. &quot;What 
is it?&quot;

&quot;How did you end up at NERV, Maya?&quot; asked Ritsuko quietly. &quot;You&#39;re so 
cheerful and optimistic and delicate. You&#39;re a breath of fresh air from 
everyone else there, myself included.&quot;

Maya blushed again. &quot;You&#39;re teasing me, Sempai.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Ritsuko sincerely, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;m being totally 
honest for a change.&quot; Another pang of guilt shot through her, but she 
shrugged it off.

&quot;Sempai?&quot; asked Maya in a concerned tone. &quot;I know I&#39;m speaking out of 
turn, but...it&#39;s not just today that you&#39;re upset about, is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s that obvious, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Ritsuko finished her cigarette and 
immediately lit another one. &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s everything, Maya. Everything 
in this stupid, cruel, unfair world. The Angels are almost finished, you 
know. There&#39;s only one more. What do you think is going to happen after 
that?&quot;

I...I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Neither do I,&quot; whispered Ritsuko. &quot;I used to think that I did, but now 
I&#39;m not so sure. Everything I&#39;d thought &#150; that I was so sure about &#150; 
that&#39;s not going to happen. Maybe deep down I always knew, but I just 
didn&#39;t want to listen.&quot;

&quot;Sempai...&quot; said Maya tenderly. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;I hope you never do. There&#39;s so much about this...about me...that you 
don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen you like this.&quot; Maya was worried. &quot;You normally seem so 
calm...so collected. I mean, you&#39;re a model of professionalism. I know 
sometimes I get a little emotional, but I&#39;m trying to be more like you 
and not do that...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; said Ritsuko suddenly. &quot;Please &#150; don&#39;t try to be more like me. 
I&#39;m the last role model you should have. You get emotional because 
you&#39;re human, Maya. Haven&#39;t you ever wondered how I can be so blas&eacute;? How 
I can stay calm when any normal person would be an emotional wreck?&quot; She 
took another drink. &quot;You were there when I told you that I hated my 
mother &#150; and I said it in the same tone that someone would use when they 
said they didn&#39;t like the steak. Is that normal, Maya?&quot;

She stopped and looked at Maya, who was looking at her with a mix of 
fear and confusion. It also looked like she was on the verge of tears.

&quot;I know,&quot; Maya said softly, &quot;that you&#39;re not nearly as calm as you 
pretend to be. I know you bottle too much stuff inside. But that doesn&#39;t 
mean anything &#150; a lot of people keep things inside &#150; a lot of people 
hide things from other people because they&#39;re scared, or they can&#39;t 
accept it, or they&#39;re worried about what other people think It doesn&#39;t 
mean you&#39;re not human, or that you&#39;re not normal.&quot; Her voice was 
trembling. She wasn&#39;t nearly so bold normally, but her Sempai seemed to 
be having a minor nervous breakdown and Maya needed to help.

Ritsuko shook her head. &quot;Oh, Maya. It isn&#39;t just that. It&#39;s everything &#150; 
everything that&#39;s happened in my stupid life ever since I went to 
college. The choices I&#39;ve made, the things I&#39;ve done, the lies I tell to 
myself and others. It&#39;s all coming to a head, I can feel it.&quot;

Maya reached out and took Ritsuko&#39;s hand in hers. She was shaking 
slightly. &quot;I...I look up to you more than anyone, Sempai. If...is...can 
I do anything?&quot;

The touch of her hands felt good to Ritsuko &#150; a simple human contact, 
but one she&#39;d had precious little of in the last few years &#150; and she 
squeezed them gratefully, seeing Maya blush as she did so. &quot;Yes,&quot; she 
whispered softly. &quot;There are a few things you can do for me tonight.&quot;

&quot;Anything,&quot; said Maya, her voice shaking. For the past few years, she 
had longed for her Sempai to get closer to her, and now that it was 
happening she could hardly believe it. Of course, the circumstances were 
hardly ideal and certainly not what she&#39;d dreamed of. However, if 
anything happened to Dr. Akaka, Maya didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d do. She 
couldn&#39;t allow her to go on hurting, as she obviously had for so long.

Maya had always suspected that her Sempai was hiding a great deal of 
hurt and pain from the outside world, but apart from brief snippets, 
she&#39;d never opened up. Now Maya was determined to get her to reveal 
everything. Then she could start to help her, and maybe she could start 
being happy again. Of course, it would be wonderful if their 
relationship deepened even further, but for now, Dr. Akagi&#39;s health was 
the only thing she cared about.

Ritsuko leaned back in her chair and took another drag of her cigarette. 
&quot;Would you like another drink?&quot; she asked. Maya shook her head, and 
Ritsuko ignored her and ordered two anyway.

&quot;Sempai,&quot; said Maya hesitantly. &quot;How much have you had to drink 
tonight?&quot;

&quot;Not enough,&quot; murmured Ritsuko. At Maya&#39;s frown, she smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry &#150; I&#39;m not turning into Misato. I just need to get loosened up a 
little. Do you know how long it&#39;s been since I got really relaxed? Not 
long enough.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me what...what I can do,&quot; said Maya soothingly.

&quot;Just listen first, Maya,&quot; said Ritsuko. &quot;Listen to everything I have to 
say, and then we&#39;ll decide what to do next.&quot; The drinks arrived and she 
handed Maya one and took one for herself. Maya started to protest, but 
Ritsuko shot her a look that made her fall silent and take the proffered 
drink. &quot;Now,&quot; said Ritsuko levelly. &quot;Where should I begin?&quot; She paused. 
&quot;I know &#150; let&#39;s start with the first, most important part. I, Ritsuko 
Akagi, am a complete and total failure. All the plans I had for my life, 
everything that I set out to do &#150; I&#39;ve failed at it all.&quot;

&quot;Sempai!&quot; protested Maya, but Ritsuko shot her another look.

&quot;Let me finish, Maya. You know what I always swore to myself &#150; that I&#39;d 
never turn into my mother. I hated her, you know...&quot; She shook her head. 
&quot;Of course you know. I told you. Ever since I was young, I&#39;ve always 
hated her.&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s head sank. &quot;When I was a child, still living at 
home, I never saw her. I had to fend for myself pretty much all of my 
teenage life. She only ever really talked to me when it suited her &#150; and 
she knew! She knew that&#39;s what she was doing, but she didn&#39;t do anything 
to fix it. She just didn&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;What about your father?&quot; asked Maya quietly.

Ritsuko closed her eyes. &quot;Never knew him. I have an almost perfect 
memory, you know. I remember events as far back as my very early 
childhood and I have no memory of him at all. Mother never mentioned him 
&#150; I asked, but she never told me. There were never any pictures of him 
either. She kept no record of him at all. Whoever he was, he managed the 
rare feat of being an even worse parent than Mother. He left before I 
was even aware of him.&quot; Ritsuko laughed hollowly. &quot;Listen to me &#150; 
judging both my parents, pronouncing judgment on them &#150; and I never 
really knew either of them. What the hell gives me the right to do that, 
considering my life?&quot;

Maya reached out and touched her hand again. &quot;Sempai...&quot;

Ritsuko opened her eyes and looked at Maya. &quot;What are your parents like? 
You know, we&#39;ve been working together for two years and I&#39;ve never 
asked.&quot;

&quot;My parents?&quot; Maya was surprised by the question. &quot;Pretty normal, I 
suppose. My Dad was a businessman, my Mom a housewife. I was an only 
child, and we were all pretty close when I was growing up. We...&quot; She 
paused. &quot;We fell out when I went to college over personal matters, but 
we managed to patch things back up recently. I mean, after the Angels 
returned, we both saw that what we were fighting over wasn&#39;t all that 
important.&quot;

Ritsuko wrapped her hand around Maya&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re very lucky,&quot; she said 
softly. She let go of Maya&#39;s hand and sat back again. &quot;Where was I? Oh 
yes &#150; Mother. She killed herself when I was at college. I might have 
hated her before, but after that I despised her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Sempai,&quot; said Maya weakly. You don&#39;t mean that.&quot;

&quot;No. I do, Maya.&quot; Ritsuko felt tears filling her eyes and she angrily 
tried to blink them back. &quot;I hate her as much now as I did then. As 
great of a scientist as she was, she was a terrible woman. Do you know 
why she killed herself? Her lover rejected her for someone else. She 
murdered that someone else, then herself. Everything she&#39;d ever taught 
me about science and its value was gone, forgotten about because a man 
was unkind to her. A man she should have known would reject her, a man 
she knew had only one true wish &#150; and she killed herself because of 
him.&quot; Ritsuko realized she was sobbing now, spitting the words out and 
she stopped, her head sinking into her hands.

Maya moved quickly round to Ritsuko&#39;s side of the table and gingerly put 
her arms around her. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she whispered softly, on the verge of 
tears herself. She&#39;d never seen Dr. Akagi cry before and now she was 
sobbing in her arms. The sight of her mentor in a pathetic heap on the 
table was hard for her, but she had to be strong.

Ritsuko leaned into Maya&#39;s embrace. &quot;I&#39;m just like her, Maya. I tried 
everything I could to distance myself from her, even down to something 
stupid like dyeing my hair, but it didn&#39;t work. After she died, I did it 
too. I got involved with him. I followed in her footsteps exactly - I 
started working in the exact same place where she worked &#150; where she 
killed herself. Every day I step over the spot where they had to clean 
my mother&#39;s blood off the floor. Is that healthy? I&#39;m just like her.I 
made all the same mistakes for him, did anything for him, even loved 
him, but it won&#39;t matter in the end. Just like her &#150; he won&#39;t pick me, 
will he? No-one will pick me...&quot;

Maya held her tightly, tears running down her face. &quot;Don&#39;t say that, 
Sempai,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Please. You&#39;re not going to do any of that. 
You&#39;re not your mother.&quot;

Ritsuko sat up and wiped her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s kind of you to say that, Maya, 
but we both know it isn&#39;t true.&quot;

&quot;You said...&quot; Maya paused, wiping her own tears away. &quot;I don&#39;t 
understand...you said you got involved with him. Do you mean your 
mother&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t ask me about that,&quot; said Ritsuko suddenly. &quot;I&#39;m not telling you 
who it is.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to know that...just...why?&quot; Maya swallowed nervously. 
&quot;For you and this man...who was involved with your mother...&quot;

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; asked Ritsuko, trying to put a humorous tone into her 
voice. &quot;Now tell me I&#39;m not screwed up.&quot; She lit another cigarette. 
&quot;Human beings do funny things for companionship. There are no logical 
reasons for the things we do. I think it&#39;s because we all crave human 
contact, no matter what kind. Take Misato and I. We&#39;re supposed to be 
friends. We have been for almost a decade, but have we ever talked about 
this? No. We didn&#39;t have a real friendship &#150; we were just two people who 
needed someone else to talk to in college. That&#39;s all.&quot;

Maya didn&#39;t know what to say, and said so.

Ritsuko smiled and finished her cigarette. &quot;I think we should leave.&quot;

&quot;Sempai...&quot; Maya frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t think you should be by yourself. I 
mean, I don&#39;t want to seem arrogant, but...&quot;

&quot;I thought we could go back to your place,&quot; said Ritsuko levelly.

Maya blushed and her eyes went as wide as saucers. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You heard me.&quot; Ritsuko downed the last of her drink. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen 
your apartment, and tonight is a night of firsts. Plus, now you know 
exactly what sort of person I am, so it&#39;s up to you if you still want me 
to go there.&quot;

Maya simply stared at her, her mouth gaping. Was she being serious? Maya 
had dreamed of that for years and now it was finally happening. Of 
course, it wasn&#39;t what she had exactly wanted, but that didn&#39;t matter. 
She couldn&#39;t abandon her now. There was an odd tone in her voice, though 
&#150; did she know how Maya felt? There wasn&#39;t an easy way to ask that, 
though. Best to assume she didn&#39;t and simply help her. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said 
firmly. &quot;I&#39;d love for you to come.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; said Ritsuko, and they did.

It was only a short journey to Maya&#39;s apartment. It was out of the main 
area of Tokyo-3, so it had escaped the destruction. They spent most of 
the journey in silence, both of their heads churning with confusion 
about where the evening was going. Ritsuko had a plan, but she still 
wasn&#39;t sure if it was all going to happen. Maya simply had no clue what 
was going on and was just improvising.

They paused before the front door. &quot;Well,&quot; said Maya nervously. &quot;This is 
it. Home sweet home.&quot; She smiled nervously and opened the door, 
gesturing for Ritsuko to enter. She did so and Maya followed. The 
apartment was a fairly small affair, simply a one bedroom, but it was 
nice. It was meticulously tidy &#150; a far cry from Ritsuko&#39;s own place, 
with its empty fridge and tar-stained walls.

It was well furnished, with a small sofa and armchair in the living 
room. The armchair was full of stuffed animals of all shapes and sizes. 
A small bookshelf to one side of the chair was filled with small 
ornaments and trinkets, mainly of anime characters and animals. A TV 
stood beside that. The kitchen was connected to the living room, and two 
other doors led off from the room. Through one, Ritsuko could see the 
bathroom. Through the other, she could vaguely make out a bed.

She walked over and pushed the bedroom door open further. It was just as 
tidy as the rest of the apartment. Apart from the bed, there was a 
computer and a wide variety of bookshelves, filled with a lot of 
computer books and manuals, official NERV reports, and a lot of what 
appeared to be romance novels. Yet more stuffed animals occupied the 
corner of the bedroom, staring up at Ritsuko.

&quot;Nice place,&quot; she said, turning back to Maya, who was clearing the 
armchair.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Maya, clearing the last of the stuffed menagerie from the 
chair. &quot;Sorry it&#39;s a bit of a mess at the moment. I wasn&#39;t expecting 
company.&quot;

&quot;Sorry to put you out.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Maya beamed at Ritsuko. &quot;It&#39;s no problem at all, really.&quot; She 
indicated the chair. &quot;Please have a seat. Would you like a drink?&quot;

Ritsuko sat down. &quot;What do you have?&quot;

Maya wandered over to the kitchen area and started rummaging through 
cupboards and the fridge. &quot;Let me see...some soda, some fruit juice, 
tea, coffee....some cheap wine, I think...&quot;

&quot;A glass of wine would be nice.&quot; Ritsuko reached into her pocket and 
pulled out her cigarettes. She was just about to light one when she 
looked up to see Maya looking at her with a disapproving glance. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Sempai,&quot; said Maya hesitantly. &quot;I know you&#39;re having a rough night and 
everything...but I&#39;d really prefer it if you didn&#39;t smoke in here.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Ritsuko put them away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t thinking.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just that the smell is really hard to get out of the furniture and 
carpet...&quot;

&quot;Maya...&quot; Ritsuko smiled. &quot;It&#39;s okay. This is your apartment, remember. 
Relax &#150; we&#39;re not at NERV at the moment.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Sempai.&quot; Maya smiled apologetically and finished getting the 
drinks. She walked over, handed one to Ritsuko and sat on the couch. 
There was a silence for a moment, neither knowing quite what to say.

Ritsuko broke the silence. &quot;Have you always lived alone?&quot; she asked.

&quot;For over a year,&quot; said Maya sadly. &quot;I was...living with someone, but 
they moved out back then and I&#39;ve been by myself ever since.&quot;

&quot;Roommate?&quot; asked Ritsuko. Maya shook her head. &quot;Ah. So...if you don&#39;t 
mind me asking, why did you and she break up?&quot;

&quot;She said I was spending too much time at work, that I wasn&#39;t paying 
enough attention to her or our relationship,&quot; said Maya unhappily 
without thinking. After a moment, she registered what Ritsuko had just 
said, and what she had just admitted. She glanced at Ritsuko in shock. 
&quot;Sempai...&quot;

Ritsuko simply smiled. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Maya. I know.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Maya didn&#39;t make her sexuality public knowledge &#150; it wasn&#39;t a 
secret, but she didn&#39;t want to be the subject of office gossip. How 
could Dr. Akagi have found out? &quot;How...&quot;

&quot;Maya, it&#39;s fairly obvious to anyone with even a little bit of 
observation skills.&quot; Ritsuko shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not a big deal, anyway. I&#39;m 
sorry to hear about your girlfriend, though. I remember you being very 
upset at work that week, too. It wasn&#39;t too long after you first started 
working with me, was it?&quot;

Maya shook her head. &quot;I was so scared you&#39;d fire me. I was such a wreck 
that week.&quot;

&quot;Fire you? Don&#39;t be silly, you&#39;re the best assistant I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;d 
never find anyone as dedicated and competent as you if I scoured the 
entire of Japan.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sempai!&quot; Maya beamed again, blushing furiously. &quot;It&#39;s been 
such an honor working with you all this time. I&#39;m glad to hear that you 
think so highly of me.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot; Ritsuko paused for a moment. She was as nervous as hell, but it 
was pretty much now or never if she wanted to go through with this. &quot;I 
have to ask, Maya &#150; I hope I didn&#39;t have anything to do with you and 
your girlfriend breaking up.&quot;

Maya suddenly coughed violently. &quot;What? I don&#39;t know what you mean!&quot;

&quot;I mean...&quot; Ritsuko paused nervously. &quot;I hope your feelings for me 
didn&#39;t interfere with your relationship.&quot;

Maya coughed even more violently this time, spraying wine halfway across 
the room. She started to sputter. &quot;Sempai, I don&#39;t...I mean, I don&#39;t 
know how you could have...I&#39;m sorry if I ever gave you that 
impression...&quot; She started to cough again halfway through her rant and 
eventually just dissolved into a full-blown coughing fit.

Ritsuko quickly got up and fetched Maya a glass of water and slapped her 
on the back. &quot;Drink this,&quot; she commanded, continuing to slap her back. 
Maya did so, and after a few minutes she had managed to stop coughing 
and calm down. &quot;That&#39;s better&quot; said Ritsuko with a smile.

Maya was as pale as the dead. &quot;Sempai,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;I think you&#39;ve 
gotten the wrong idea. I mean, just because I&#39;m...gay, it doesn&#39;t mean 
that...&quot;

&quot;Maya,&quot; said Ritsuko soothingly. &quot;It&#39;s all right. Aren&#39;t we both being 
honest tonight? You can be honest with me, can&#39;t you?&quot;

The other woman didn&#39;t meet her gaze. &quot;I should go,&quot; she said quietly. 
&quot;I think we&#39;ve both gotten confused...&quot;

&quot;This is your apartment. Where would you go?&quot; Ritsuko sat back down on 
the armchair. &quot;It doesn&#39;t bother me, Maya. I mean, maybe it did at 
first, but I&#39;ve had a lot of time to get used to the idea.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t!&quot; protested Maya again, but seeing the look in Ritsuko&#39;s eyes 
she slumped back in her seat. &quot;When did you figure it out?&quot; she said 
softly.

&quot;I can&#39;t remember exactly. You used to be a lot better at hiding it, 
though. That much I do remember.&quot; Ritsuko paused. &quot;It wasn&#39;t long after 
you started working for me &#150; one day I looked around, and you were just 
looking at me with such a devoted look in your eyes. I wasn&#39;t used to 
that kind of look, one with so much respect and affection in it. At 
first, I thought you just looked up to me...you know, a kind of hero 
worship thing.&quot;

&quot;Sempai...&quot; said Maya weakly, the blush now threatening to engulf her 
entire face.

Ritsuko sighed softly and continued. &quot;But as things went on, I realized 
it was more than that. I caught you looking at me more, and each time, 
the look in your eyes grew less and less like a simple case of hero 
worship and more like a full-blown crush. Then there was that time you 
got completely drunk at the Christmas party and almost blurted out the 
whole thing in front of everyone.&quot;

&quot;Oh God.&quot; Maya put her head in her hands. &quot;I&#39;d forgotten about that. 
I...I was going to tell you. I was so sure that you were...you 
know...and I was going to tell you how I felt. But I was so scared...I 
don&#39;t normally drink heavily...&quot;

&quot;That night you were giving Misato a real run for her money,&quot; said 
Ritsuko dryly.

&quot;I was so scared, and I kept taking a drink every time I lost my nerve, 
trying to build enough courage to tell you, but I don&#39;t really handle a 
lot of alcohol very well.&quot; Maya groaned. &quot;I must have looked a sight. I 
stumbled in, and I saw you and I walked over to you, didn&#39;t I? I walked 
over and I said loudly that I had something to tell you.&quot; She frowned. 
&quot;But before I could blurt it out in front of everyone, you stopped me. 
Why did you do that?&quot;

Ritsuko smiled sadly. &quot;I already knew, remember? I knew what you were 
going to say, or at least had a very good idea. The look in your eyes 
when you were drunk sealed the whole thing. I didn&#39;t want you 
embarrassing yourself &#150; I knew it would really kill you, so I stopped 
you and made you lie down in the NERV dorms until the next morning. Then 
you seemed to have forgotten the whole thing.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Maya sincerely. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I did that.&quot; She 
looked up at Ritsuko cautiously. &quot;Sempai...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Ritsuko suddenly. &quot;Don&#39;t call me that anymore tonight. Call 
me Ritsuko.&quot;

&quot;Sempai,&quot; said Maya pleadingly, but when she saw the look in Ritsuko&#39;s 
eyes she sighed. &quot;Ritsuko...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve ever said my name,&quot; said Ritsuko 
thoughtfully. &quot;It only took you two years.&quot;

Despite herself, Maya smiled. &quot;Ritsuko, why did you ask to come back to 
my apartment tonight?&quot;

&quot;How do you feel about me, Maya?&quot;

Maya blinked in surprise. &quot;What?&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;You know 
that,&quot; she said quietly.

&quot;I want to hear you say it out loud.&quot; Ritsuko looked at her intently. 
&quot;Please.&quot;

Maya looked at her for a long time. She knew how she felt and she knew 
what she had to say, but now, even though it was all out in the open, 
verbalizing the feelings was still daunting for her. This whole night 
felt very unreal, almost too good to be true. She didn&#39;t want anything 
to ruin it, not now.

But then she looked in Ritsuko&#39;s eyes and saw her pleading look and she 
knew what she had to say. She took a deep breath and said the words to 
Ritsuko Akagi that she had wanted to ever since she had met her.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Ritsuko closed her eyes. &quot;Say my name,&quot; she said weakly.

&quot;I love you, Ritsuko.&quot;

Ritsuko felt tears brimming in her eyes and she squeezed them shut 
tighter. &quot;Why?&quot;

Maya smiled. &quot;Because you&#39;re...well, you&#39;re you. You&#39;re so smart, so 
warm - even if people do think you&#39;re cold, I don&#39;t. They don&#39;t see the 
Ritsuko that I see. You&#39;re so compassionate &#150; you&#39;ve dedicated 
everything to your work with NERV &#150; work that&#39;s going to save the human 
race! You might act like you&#39;re icy and calm all the time, but you 
really do care deeply about people &#150; I&#39;ve seen you like that. And 
because you&#39;re beautiful, you really are &#150; you have this amazing smile 
that no-one ever sees. I&#39;ve only seen it a few times, but it lights up 
your entire face. And there&#39;s this big...sadness about you &#150; like you 
have a lot of pain inside, and I can&#39;t help thinking that if you could 
just let it out, and if you were with someone who could make you happy &#150; 
I mean really happy &#150; then you&#39;d be even more amazing than you already 
are.&quot; Maya paused. &quot;That&#39;s why I love you, Ritsuko.&quot;

Ritsuko opened her now tear stained eyes. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you have a rather 
inflated opinion of me, Maya.&quot;

Gathering all of her courage and strength, Maya stood up, walked over to 
Ritsuko and sat down beside her. She smiled nervously and reached out to 
stroke Ritsuko&#39;s face. Then, taking a deep breath, she leaned over and 
kissed her lightly on the lips. Ritsuko was surprised, but didn&#39;t pull 
away. Emboldened by this, Maya opened her mouth and slipped her tongue 
slowly into Ritsuko&#39;s mouth, Ritsuko offering no resistance. She tasted 
smoky, the alcohol still fresh on her breath.

After a few moments, Maya pulled back and smiled, looking into Ritsuko&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I think my opinion&#39;s pretty accurate,&quot; she said softly.

Ritsuko smiled weakly. &quot;Are you seducing me, Maya?&quot;

Maya&#39;s eyes went wide and she blushed again. &quot;Ritsuko, I&#39;m not...I 
mean...&quot;

&quot;If you are, you&#39;ll notice I&#39;m not stopping you.&quot; Ritsuko met Maya&#39;s 
gaze again and smiled. &quot;I mean, isn&#39;t this what you&#39;ve always wanted?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Maya, &quot;but you&#39;re not yourself tonight. It wouldn&#39;t be 
right &#150; I couldn&#39;t take advantage of you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not taking advantage of me if I&#39;m willing, is it?&quot;

Maya looked at her, not believing what she was hearing. Yes, this had 
been a dream &#150; actually more of a fantasy &#150; for years now, but she had 
never seriously believed that it would come true, and certainly not in 
the form of Ritsuko coming to her apartment and blatantly offering 
herself. There was something wrong here, and Maya didn&#39;t want to take 
advantage of the situation, even as much as she wanted to. &quot;I...can&#39;t,&quot; 
she said finally.

Ritsuko reached out and stroked her face. &quot;I really can&#39;t be alone 
tonight,&quot; she said softly, staring into Maya&#39;s eyes. Then she leaned 
over and softly kissed Maya on the lips again. She had never considered 
being with another woman before, but after all she had seen and all she 
had been through at NERV and in the rest of her life, petty concerns 
over gender seemed irrelevant now. All that mattered was that there was 
someone here who loved her and wanted her, and she needed that right 
now.

The tone of Ritsuko&#39;s voice and the feel of her soft lips on Maya&#39;s 
dissolved any doubts that the younger woman might have had. She leaned 
into the kiss, opening her mouth and wrapping her arms around Ritsuko, 
drawing her close. Their hands wandered, exploring the soft curves of 
their bodies, melding both their bodies into one.

After several wonderful moments, Ritsuko drew back. &quot;I&#39;ve...&quot; She paused 
and swallowed nervously. &quot;I&#39;ve never done anything like this before. Not 
with another woman.&quot;

Maya smiled, her confidence growing by the second. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she 
whispered, punctuating each of her words with soft kisses to the neck. 
&quot;Just follow my lead.&quot; Ritsuko returned the smile and they both 
awkwardly got to their feet, still in each other&#39;s arms. Maya reached 
around and unwrapped the shirt from around the blonde&#39;s neck and let it 
fall to the floor. &quot;If I&#39;m going too fast,&quot; she said softly, &quot;just tell 
me.&quot;

Ritsuko nodded as Maya&#39;s hands began to unbutton her shirt, followed by 
her shorts. Maya slid them both off with expert precision. &quot;You&#39;ve done 
this before.&quot;

Maya grinned. &quot;Quite a bit.&quot; Her hands wandered again, and Ritsuko&#39;s 
underwear soon followed the rest of her clothes onto the floor. When she 
had finished, she took a step back and looked at Ritsuko&#39;s naked body. 
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she said warmly.

The older woman fought the urge to cover herself up in awkwardness. 
She&#39;d never had someone compliment her body in that tone before, and she 
felt very self-conscious. Suddenly, she was aware of every minute flaw 
in her body, but Maya&#39;s tone was not critical in the slightest. &quot;I bet 
you say that to all your girlfriends.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never had one as beautiful as you.&quot; Maya caught her eye again, and 
Ritsuko saw the sincerity in it.

&quot;I had no idea you were such a hit with the ladies.&quot; Ritsuko took Maya&#39;s 
face in her hands and kissed her again, then began pulling off her 
t-shirt, then her jeans, noting the feel of Maya&#39;s soft skin and subtle 
curves. She looked at Maya, now in her underwear. Her body was slim, 
almost boyish, but she was undeniably beautiful. In her own way, Maya 
was a paragon of beauty.

Ritsuko took another deep breath and began to remove Maya&#39;s underwear, 
slowly and deliberately exposing the other woman&#39;s body. In a few 
moments, she was naked as well. Ritsuko stood facing her, a nervous 
smile on her face. &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

Maya smiled and reached a hand out to lightly stroke up Ritsuko&#39;s body. 
Her fingers lightly danced over her stomach, up over her breasts and 
ended up at her face. Then she drew her into another deep kiss. Their 
naked bodies pressed together, their hands exploring every inch of the 
other&#39;s body, pulling tightly together. The feel of Maya&#39;s lips, the 
sensation of her body pressed against hers sent Ritsuko into a flurry of 
arousal. She kissed Maya hungrily, feeling Maya&#39;s love and desire 
through her body, surrendering herself completely to the moment.

She became dimly aware of Maya shuffling them slowly to the bedroom and 
she willingly went along with it. They reached the bedroom, and Maya 
pushed her gently down onto the bed, then with a mischievous smile 
climbed on top.

Ritsuko awoke with a start, suddenly unsure of her surroundings. This 
wasn&#39;t her office at NERV, nor her apartment &#150; the two main places she 
woke up. She was lying on her side facing a window, the moonlight 
shining in. She was naked, and felt another naked body pressed up 
against her, holding her from behind.

Then the memories came back. She was in Maya Ibuki&#39;s apartment, and she 
and the young bridge technician had been making love for the best part 
of the night. A wave of guilt swept over her as the whole memory of the 
previous night flooded into her head. For a moment she tried to blame 
the alcohol, but she hadn&#39;t had that much to drink and she&#39;d known 
exactly what she was doing. She had used Maya and that thought made her 
sick.

Maya shifted in her sleep, her arms wrapping tighter around Ritsuko. 
Maya mumbled something sleepily, and kissed the back of Ritsuko&#39;s neck 
tenderly. The simple and uncomplicated love in that one gesture almost 
made Ritsuko burst into tears there and then. Memories of the lovemaking 
came into her head &#150; it had been wonderful. Maya was a skilled lover, 
and everything she had done had been infused with care and tenderness. 
Ritsuko had never known anything like that before &#150; even something as 
small as being held afterwards was completely alien to her.

Tears ran down Ritsuko&#39;s face and she felt herself sobbing slightly. It 
would be wonderful if this could last, but it couldn&#39;t. She&#39;d known that 
coming in, so there was no point in lamenting that fact now. Even so, 
she couldn&#39;t help wishing &#150; but wishing had never done anything for her.

She composed herself and gently extricated herself from Maya&#39;s embrace. 
She slowly got out of bed, moving gingerly so as not to wake the younger 
woman. Once she was out, she took a final look down at the bed. Maya 
looked so peaceful, so utterly beautiful lying there and it broke 
Ritsuko&#39;s heart all over again. Trying to keep her self control, she 
pulled herself away and left the room in search of her clothes.
Maya awoke from a blissful dream, one in which she had confessed her 
secret love to her Sempai, and it had lead to a night of wonderful, 
passionate lovemaking. Then with a start, she remembered that it hadn&#39;t 
been a dream &#150; it had been real, and she had ended up in bed with 
Ritsuko Akagi. Her eyes flew open and she realized that she was alone in 
bed, Ritsuko having left.

She sat up, wondering if she had simply gone to the bathroom or 
something similar. The unsettling though that Ritsuko might have left in 
shame or embarrassment crept into her mind, and it filled her stomach 
with icy fear. She quickly got out of bed, realized she was still naked, 
and looked around for her clothes. Then she remembered that they had 
stripped in the living room.

The memory of the previous night made a silly grin appear on her face. 
It had been wonderful, everything she had always dreamed about. She 
hoped that Ritsuko hadn&#39;t fled &#150; she didn&#39;t want their working 
relationship (or whatever their new relationship was) to become awkward 
&#150; or more terrible &#150; to sour completely. Quickly, she grabbed a robe and 
walked out to the living room, hoping that Ritsuko was still there.

She was.

Ritsuko was sitting at the kitchen table, smoking. Stupidly, the first 
thing that came into Maya&#39;s mind was to chide her for smoking in her 
apartment, but she suppressed that urge. From the size of the makeshift 
ashtray in front of her, it looked like she had been there for a while. 
Her eyes were badly red-rimmed. She&#39;d obviously been crying heavily.

&quot;Ritsuko?&quot; said Maya softly.

The older woman turned to face her, obviously not having heard her come 
in. &quot;Maya,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to wake you up. I was just 
going to quietly leave, and...&quot;

&quot;You were just going to leave?&quot; Maya&#39;s heart sank. &quot;I...I don&#39;t 
understand.&quot;

Ritsuko&#39;s head sank. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Maya, I really am,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid I&#39;ve hurt you badly.&quot;

&quot;No, no.&quot; Maya shook her head. &quot;You haven&#39;t hurt me. Last night was 
wonderful.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it was.&quot; Ritsuko smiled sadly. She had known that it was going to 
be like this. This was going to hurt both of them very badly. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Maya. I&#39;ve used you.&quot;

&quot;Used me?&quot; Maya felt tears welling up in her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

Ritsuko stubbed out her cigarette, stood up, and forced herself to look 
Maya in the eyes, no matter how much it hurt. &quot;Remember what I said last 
night? I meant it &#150; something is coming, Maya. I just know it. 
Everything is going to come to a head soon, and no-one...&quot; She felt her 
voice catch. &quot;No-one is going to choose me. I&#39;m all alone, don&#39;t you see 
that?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; The tears were running down Maya&#39;s face freely now. &quot;You&#39;re not, 
you know that. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I know. That&#39;s why I came out last night to see you. I just wanted...&quot; 
Her face fell again. She couldn&#39;t look Maya in the eye. &quot;I just wanted 
to spend one night &#150; just one &#150; with someone who actually cared about me 
&#150; who loved me. That was you, Maya. I just used you because I needed 
someone to be with me, and your feelings made you the perfect person.&quot;

Maya&#39;s gut churned. In all of her dreams, she&#39;d never once thought about 
something like this.

&quot;I told you your opinion of me was slightly inflated,&quot; muttered Ritsuko 
darkly.

&quot;What...what are you going to do now?&quot; Maya managed to say.

&quot;Go back to NERV, I suppose. Whatever&#39;s coming, I know I can&#39;t avoid it. 
I&#39;m in too deep already.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Ritsuko looked up, a surprised look on her face. &quot;What?&quot;

Maya took a deep breath and took Ritsuko&#39;s hands. &quot;No. It&#39;s not too late 
for you. You could leave &#150; we could leave. You don&#39;t have to let this 
happen, Ritsuko.&quot;

Ritsuko smiled warmly and stroked Maya&#39;s face gently. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Maya. 
You were right &#150; last night really was wonderful, and if things were 
different, maybe I could do that. But I&#39;ve seen too much, done too much. 
It really is too late for me. But you...you should leave, forget NERV. 
It&#39;s not a good place &#150; not for someone as innocent and good as you. You 
should leave as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving you,&quot; Maya mumbled through tears.

Ritsuko leaned over and gently kissed her on the lips. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, 
Maya,&quot; she whispered tearfully. &quot;If I ever manage to make it through 
this, I only hope that you can forgive me.&quot;

Maya sank into a chair and burst into tears. Ritsuko looked at her for a 
moment, then left, closing the apartment door behind her. The sound of 
Maya&#39;s sobs could be heard through the door and Ritsuko slumped down 
onto the floor, tears running down her cheeks.

Her NERV communicator bleeped, and she pulled it out and listened to the 
message. She closed her eyes, and shut of the communicator. The heads of 
SEELE had requested a meeting &#150; or interrogation &#150; with her.

This was it &#150; the beginning of the end. Wiping the tears from her eyes, 
she got to her feet, gave Maya&#39;s apartment door a last glance, and 
walked off into her future.

The End.

End Notes:

Well, another one finished! I&#39;ve always liked the Maya/Ritsuko pairing, 
though it&#39;s a frustrating relationship, given that you know it will 
never have a happy ending, no matter how badly you want one, or think 
Maya really deserves to get the girl J

This takes place sometime during the events of Episode 23.</pre>
