<h1>Third Genesis (part 22 of 39)</h1>

<a href="../eva/3gen-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>&quot;Hey Pen -pen,&quot; Misato looked amused.

The penguin dashed by, holding a package of beef jerky and heading to 
the bathroom for a hot bath. Shaking her head Misato set her bags down 
on the counter, then she stretched out to try to get the stiffness of 
sitting around an office to go away.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; Misato called out as she heard the front door open. The 
black haired commander of NERV was still wearing her usual red jacket 
and pants, having just gotten home only a few moments before.

&quot;We brought company,&quot; Asuka&#39;s voice called back.

&#39;Wonder if it&#39;s...&#39; Misato walked over to the entrance where she saw 
Toji, Aida and Hikari taking their shoes off. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; 
she offered them a smile.

Toji looked uncomfortable, the tall young man leaning on his cane. 
&quot;Misato,&quot; he smiled slightly as brown hair fell into his eyes, &quot;it&#39;s 
nice to see you again.&quot;

Aida looked at the insignia on her collar and it looked like the blonde 
haired boy&#39;s eyes were going to pop out. &quot;General?&quot; he squeaked.

&quot;It happened awhile ago,&quot; Misato said quickly to head off the boy&#39;s 
likely reaction, &quot;it&#39;s a little too late for a celebration.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Hikari murmured, a slight smile on the brown haired girl&#39;s 
face. &quot;The last celebration here was the first time I was invited over,&quot; 
she said.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Asuka shrugged slightly as the redhead continued, &quot;I hope you 
don&#39;t mind that I invited them over, Misato.&quot;

&quot;It was partially my fault, too,&quot; Rei offered with one of her sudden 
smiles, her blue hair helping to bring out those striking eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Misato quickly reassured them. She grinned, &quot;Maya and 
Ritsuko are stopping over later, we&#39;re having dinner together again.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; and with that Asuka lead the others off down to the bedroom.

&quot;She&#39;s as beautiful as ever,&quot; Aida sighed to himself dreamily.

&quot;And still way out of your league,&quot; Toji offered with a laugh.

&quot;Still, there&#39;s something that&#39;s different about her from when we were 
over here before,&quot; Hikari noted, Asuka and Rei smiling mysteriously.

&quot;Toji,&quot; Misato called before they could get too far, &quot;could I talk to 
you a moment?&quot;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Toji murmured.

&quot;She&#39;s not going to bite you,&quot; Asuka scolded him softly but with 
surprising gentleness, &quot;go on, you can catch up.&quot;

Misato watched Toji enter the kitchen, studying the young man 
thoughtfully. The cane he leaned on was the most obvious sign of his 
injury but there were others. The lines on his face looked odd on such a 
young man, as did the tension in his shoulders.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Misato said to him gently, &quot;you haven&#39;t done anything 
wrong.&quot;

Toji puffed out a breath, &quot;Right.&quot;

Misato reached out to softly put a hand on his shoulder as she said, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Toji looked over at her in surprise as she continued on, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know if anyone at NERV ever apologized for what happened to 
you....&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&#39; Toji shook his head.

&quot;I know the sort of tactics that Ritsuko used to get you into a pilot&#39;s 
seat,&quot; Misato sighed in memory of the bad old days at NERV, &quot;I&#39;d say an 
apology is the least that we can do.&quot; She gave him a gentle smile and 
asked, &quot;How&#39;s your sister?&quot;

&quot;Awake,&quot; Toji flashed her an uncomfortable smile, &quot;and out of the 
hospital finally.&quot; He looked down shyly as he continued, &quot;The 
specialists that NERV provided made the difference, so I think it&#39;s been 
a fair trade.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Misato conceded. She grinned, &quot;You&#39;d better get back to the 
others before Aida decides I&#39;m having my wicked way with you.&quot;

Toji&#39;s face went beet red. &quot;Thanks,&quot; and with that he headed up the 
hallway.

Misato watched him go, glad that things were improving for Toji finally. 
Her actions along with Ritsuko and Gendo Ikari&#39;s had cost this boy his 
leg and very nearly taken his life and no matter how many apologies she 
offered him it could never be enough. Still, it was something and it did 
make her feel a little bit better.

&quot;Now,&quot; Misato shook herself as she walked over to the phone and mused, 
&quot;I wonder what sort of take-out I should order tonight?&quot;

Up the hallway Hikari looked up and smiled in relief as Toji entered. 
The others were sitting around the room or on the beds, both singles 
pushed together. From the challenging look on Asuka&#39;s face she was 
daring anyone to make a comment on it.

&quot;Nice room,&quot; Toji wisely decided not to ask.

&quot;So what happened?&quot; Hikari reached out to take Toji&#39;s hand, smiling up 
at him as she tugged him down to a seat beside her on the bed.

&quot;It was weird,&quot; Toji admitted as he described the scene in the messy 
kitchen.

Aida shook his head mournfully, &quot;She apologized and you didn&#39;t take 
advantage of it?&quot; His eyes sparkled, &quot;I would have asked for a kiss, at 
least.&quot;

Hikari casually whapped him on the back of the head, a easily familiar 
gesture. &quot;Baka,&quot; she sighed, &quot;this was serious, I think.&quot;

Asuka nodded slightly. &quot;I think she&#39;s always felt bad about what 
happened,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;even though they didn&#39;t have much 
choice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve read the files,&quot; Rei agreed gravely, &quot;there were few other options 
than to consider Unit 04 to be an enemy and stop it with all necessarily 
force.&quot;

Toji puffed out a breath, &quot;Could we please not talk about this?&quot;

&quot;Ah, sempai....&quot; Maya squeaked out softly, her brown hair slightly 
mussed.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ritsuko purred, the taller blonde looking down at her hungrily.

Maya gulped, Ritsuko reaching out to make little circles with her finger 
on Maya&#39;s chest. &quot;We,&quot; she shivered slightly, &quot;do have to go over to 
Misato&#39;s to dinner later.&quot;

Ritsuko laughed softly, &quot;What I have in mind won&#39;t take all that long, 
you know.&quot;

Maya blushed charmingly and Ritsuko relented, taking a half step away 
from her lover. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Maya said shyly, &quot;it&#39;s hard to think when you 
do that.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s the idea,&quot; Ritsuko said unashamedly as she sat them both 
down on their spacious living room couch.

&quot;Sempai,&quot; Maya scolded.

Ritsuko sat back, her blonde hair flowing around her shoulders, the lab 
coat she still wore sparkling white. &quot;So what did you want to talk 
about?&quot; she asked curiously.

Maya gulped nervously, running a hand through her brown hair. She put a 
hand in her uniform pocket as she said, &quot;You know we&#39;ve been together 
for awhile....&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ritsuko prompted her after a moment.

&quot;I wanted to give you this,&quot; Maya&#39;s cheeks were red as she drew a small 
box from her pocket, extending it to Ritsuko with a slightly shaking 
hand even as she popped it open.

Ritsuko&#39;s eyes widened as she looked at the simple gold ring then up to 
Maya&#39;s fearful eyes. &quot;Are you,&quot; she croaked before clearing her throat, 
&quot;proposing?&quot;

Maya couldn&#39;t seem to get her mouth to work, so instead she just nodded 
jerkily.

Ritsuko gently took the ring and slid it on her finger as she said, 
&quot;Yes.&quot;</pre>
