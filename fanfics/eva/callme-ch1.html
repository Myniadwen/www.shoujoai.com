<h1>Call Me</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        I stare at the phone for the eighth consecutive hour.
        Eight hours have passed and she still hasn&#39;t called me. When
we reached my apartment and the door slid open with that cold
metallic hiss I can remember her smile. It was soft and it barely lifted
up the edges of her mouth. Smoothly she reached out to cup my
cheek before she pulled me towards her for an all encompassing kiss.
        When we finally parted she smiled again and touched my
cheek with the back of her hand. &quot;I&#39;ll call you,&quot; she said.
        That was last night.
        She still hasn&#39;t called.
        Part of me feels ridiculous for staring at the phone like this. It
isn&#39;t as if my stare is going to magically cause it to ring. And still
another part of me feels enraged at her for promising to call me then
not doing it.
        But perhaps something has happened to her. Maybe she was
delayed on her way home and couldn&#39;t call me. My heart stops as I
imagine her being mugged on that damn subway she insists on always
taking. What if she&#39;s been hurt and that&#39;s why she hasn&#39;t called?
        No... that&#39;s not it. She works for NERV and like me she has
been trained in the ways of self-defense. Nothing has happened to
her.
        Then why hasn&#39;t she called me?
        Could it have been a lie? That she doesn&#39;t really want to call
me and she said that merely as a let down? Panic fills my system and I
run through the scenario again. Her eyes had looked at me in warmth
and in love. Or at least I thought they had. Was she pretending the
entire time?
        No... that&#39;s not it. She couldn&#39;t have been pretending. She&#39;s a
lousy liar. Everyone knows that.
        Besides that we work together. She&#39;s going to have to see me
on Monday and maybe even sooner if an emergency arises. And in
our line of work they always do.
        So why hasn&#39;t she called me?
        I stare at the phone for the eighth consecutive hour and the
twenty second minute.
        This is ridiculous! I shouldn&#39;t be doing this. I&#39;m a highly
respected person of science. I&#39;m a person of value and means. I
shouldn&#39;t be sitting here staring at the phone. I don&#39;t need her to call
me. It doesn&#39;t matter to me!
        I stare at the phone for the eighth consecutive hour and the
twenty third minute.
        A slow scowl forms on my features and I rest my chin on the
tops of my hands. How could she do this to me? No one has ever
kept me waiting like this. It&#39;s an outrage! Who says they&#39;re going to
call you then doesn&#39;t?
        Evil, heartless, and sadistic people. That&#39;s who.
        God dammit! Why hasn&#39;t she called me?
        I force my mind to shift into my logistical state of
contemplation. It could be that she meant she would call me but not
right away. That she would call me tomorrow.
        But it is tomorrow. Our date ended a little past midnight last
night and it is now the next day and she still hasn&#39;t called me.
        It&#39;s now 1:24 p.m. She could be doing other things and when
she finishes with whatever those other things are she&#39;s going to call
me.
        What if she forgot? That&#39;s always a possibility. She may have
a logical mind but she&#39;s hardly flawless. It&#39;s entirely possible she forgot
that she promised to call me.
        I form a grimace at this thought.
        How could she have forgotten?!
        I stare at the phone for the eighth consecutive hour and the
twenty fifth minute.
        Twitching slightly I jerkily rise to my feet and pick up the
phone then begin to shake it wildly.
        &quot;Why haven&#39;t you called me?!&quot; I shout.
        Slamming the phone onto the desk in a harsh gesture I stalk
across the room and sit in my large comfortable recliner as I try to
calm myself.
        I stare at the phone for the eighth consecutive hour and the
twenty seventh minute.
        Just as I feel my eyes growing weak and getting blurry from
staring at the phone for so long a shrill ring fills the air. I jump on
hearing it and hastily rise out of the recliner.
        Quickly I cross the room and wait for the phone to ring again.
When it does I hastily pick up the receiver and say in what I hope to
be calm tones, &quot;Hello?&quot;
        Her warm voice greets my ears and a smile spreads across
my features. She called, just as she promised.
        &quot;Maya,&quot; I say her name quietly. &quot;I missed you.&quot;
        &quot;Ritsuko,&quot; she replies. &quot;I missed you too.&quot;

-End-

Both characters in this fanfiction are from Neon Genesis Evangelion.
This was inspired from, well, just being a girl and having to wait for
that damn phone call you were promised. Why Maya and Ritsuko? I
really don&#39;t know. It just seemed to fit for some reason. This fanfiction
was also inspired by the Blondie song Call Me and some of the lyrics
of the song are provided below.
