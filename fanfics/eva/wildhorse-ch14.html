<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 14 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/wildhorse-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Nabiki was just about to start the video when an unwelcome guest crashed 
in. The bone-chilling laugh immediately allowed them to identify who it 
was.

&quot;So, all of the low-born harridans who futilely pursue my darling Ranma 
have gathered together to gloat of your treachery,&quot; the leotard-clad 
lunatic proclaimed. &quot;I demand to know where you are hiding my Ranma at 
once!&quot;

Nabiki sighed as a four-way battle ensued between the fianc&eacute;es and the 
delusional nut job. They would have to wait for the mentally infirm to 
be run off before continuing.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;Kodachi Kuno,&quot; Nabiki answered. &quot;She&#39;s the sister of Tatewaki Kuno and 
fancies herself in the running for Ranma&#39;s affections. However, she&#39;s as 
delusional as her older brother and wants to kill Ranma&#39;s girl side, 
while wanting to date Ranma&#39;s boy side. Her brother is worse. He wants 
to date Ranma&#39;s girl side and Akane at the same time while accusing 
Ranma&#39;s boy side of being a foul sorcerer that holds his loves in 
thrall. Neither of them realizes that boy-type Ranma and girl-type Ranma 
are the same person in spite of seeing the change happen on several 
occasions. The Kuno family is both filthy rich and certifiably crazy and 
Ranma wants nothing to do with either of them.&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Nodoka asked, shaking her head in dismay.

Shortly afterward, Ukyo, Shampoo, and Akane returned and they began the 
next episode.

(oO\O/Oo)

Alarm klaxons began to sound in the Central Dogma control center. Techs 
immediately began typing furiously on their terminals as they worked to 
determine the situation.

&quot;Report,&quot; Gendo Ikari said calmly from behind his steepled hands in his 
command balcony.

&quot;Sir, we have a pattern blue incoming. It&#39;s already breached the outer 
defenses,&quot; Aoba reported.

Just then, the angel fired a beam of some kind, causing a huge 
cross-shaped explosion.

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Hyuga exclaimed. &quot;It just penetrated 18 layers of armor in 
one shot!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll never get the Eva&#39;s to the surface to engage it in time,&quot; Misato 
declared. &quot;Have Unit&#39;s 01 and 02 deployed inside the geofront.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Hyuga acknowledged.

Behind his hands, Gendo grinned evilly. It was time the boy was taken 
down a few pegs. Glancing down at a button on his terminal, he would 
wait until the time was right to initiate his plan.

&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea, Gendo?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked quietly. 
&quot;What if the boy freezes up? That will leave the Second Child out there 
alone with no backup.&quot;

&quot;Or it could make the boy even more effective,&quot; Gendo pointed out. 
&quot;Anyway, I need to see the effect it has and it may give me more control 
of the boy. God knows we have precious little of that at the moment. 
That fool, Genma, managed to give him a serious disregard for 
authority.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Are you ready for this, Variable-chan?&quot; Asuka asked, taking a few 
practice swipes with her naginata and checking that her spears were 
within easy reach.

&quot;You know it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Asuka...be careful. I got a bad feeling 
about this one.&quot;

&quot;You worry too much, Liebling,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;We can handle it.&quot;

&quot;I know, but this angel feels really strong,&quot; Ranma cautioned. &quot;Please 
just be careful.&quot;

&quot;Okay, if it will make you feel better,&quot; Asuka said.

Any further discussion was cut off by an explosion from the ceiling of 
the geofront, followed by what looked like a cross between a headless 
Pillsbury doughboy and an English bulldog, only three times as ugly, 
floating down through the hole.

&quot;Engaging target,&quot; Asuka announced and let fly with a spear.

The oversized spear flew true towards the angel and looked like it was 
going to score a direct hit. However at the last second, it slammed into 
a really strong AT field and was stopped dead. Ranma and Asuka both 
began launching spears at the angel in an effort to overwhelm its AT 
field as it drifted to the floor of the Geo-front. The effort seemed 
futile as the thing reached the ground unscathed.

Suddenly, Asuka heard Ranma scream over the comm and saw Unit 01 fall to 
the ground in fetal position with its arms over its head.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Asuka yelled urgently. &quot;Ranma what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Asuka was caught up in what was happening to Ranma and failed to notice 
the angel&#39;s arms unfold like accordion paper. The angel lashed out at 
her. Fortunately, Ranma&#39;s training held. Asuka sensed the attack just in 
time to twist her torso, causing the angel&#39;s arms to pass to either side 
of her. Had she not twisted, they would have sliced off her arms.

She wasn&#39;t out of the woods yet though because the flat, paper-like arms 
swiftly curled around her Eva and threw Unit 02 across the geofront, 
crashing through trees and structures as Asuka screamed.

When she finally came to a stop, she heard...a cat?

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Dr. Akagi! Ranma&#39;s sync ratio is fluctuating wildly!&quot; Maya called out 
from her monitor. &quot;His brain waves are completely erratic! Heart rate is 
racing!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s causing it? Is the angel attacking him somehow?&quot; Ritsuko 
demanded.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Ma&#39;am, but his sync ratio appears to be spiking 
incredibly high!&quot; Maya announced.

Up on the command balcony, Gendo removed his finger from the button and 
grinned wickedly.

&quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing,&quot; Fuyutsuki said softly.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma had thrown his last spear as the angel settled to the ground. 
Suddenly, his view was filled with the most terrifying sight imaginable. 
Horrible demons were attacking him, frothing and spitting at him from 
all sides with gleaming fangs and razor sharp claws.

Ranma screamed in terror and curled up into a ball, unable to escape the 
onslaught as the demons tore into his flesh just like they did back in 
the pit. Finally, the terror became too much and Ranma&#39;s world went 
dark.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka struggled to get to her feet just in time to see Ranma&#39;s Eva get 
up on all fours with its back arched unnaturally. It appeared to be 
hissing and growling like a cat as it faced off with the angel. She 
could do nothing but watch in shock as the strange scene unfolded before 
her.

The angel lashed out its arms at the oddly behaving Eva only to have the 
Eva bounce away from the attack with a disturbing nimbleness. The Eva 
then batted a hand at the ribbon-like arm closest to it and a length of 
the arm fell away, sliced off cleanly. Sensing a new level of threat, 
the angel began to flail about wildly as Unit 01 bounced around the area 
like some mad superball.

The Eva&#39;s evasions carried it steadily closer to the flailing angel and 
soon huge gashes began to open up on the angel&#39;s body. It tried to fire 
its energy beam at Unit 01, but the Eva was far too fast to be hit like 
that. The Eva just continued to bounce around and slash at the angel 
with half-seen reddish claws that appeared to be made from its AT field.

It quickly became clear to Asuka that the cat-like Eva was toying with 
the angel, like a cat does with a mouse. Soon the angel was covered in 
shallow gashes and streaked red with its own blood. Its ribbon arms were 
ragged shreds as it struggled to regenerate itself.

It was then that the Eva tired of its game and moved in for the kill. 
The end came swiftly as the AT claws gutted the angel and knocked it to 
the ground. It was an anti-climax compared to what came afterwards.

Asuka felt like vomiting as the Eva began to eat the angel.

(oO\O/Oo)

There were several faces tinged with green in the control center and 
several of the techs turned away from the grisly scene.

&quot;I-it&#39;s eating the angel?&quot; Misato asked in dismay.

&quot;She&#39;s taking the angel&#39;s S2 organ into herself,&quot; Ritsuko said.

&quot;My god,&quot; Maya gasped. &quot;Ranma&#39;s sync ratio is over 400 percent!&quot;

As the various parties looked on, the Eva finished eating and sat back 
on its haunches, roaring its dominance over its domain. Feeling 
restrained, it began clawing at the armor plates covering it, causing 
huge slabs of the stuff to fall away.

&quot;My god, she&#39;s breaking free,&quot; Ritsuko whispered.

&quot;Breaking free? What do you mean?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;That&#39;s not just armor,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;Those are restraints that allow 
us to control the Eva.&quot;

Unit 01 roared once again and then paused as if sniffing the air. 
Looking around it spotted Unit 02 standing some distance away. With a 
roar, it bounded toward the red Eva.

&quot;Oh my god! Asuka!&quot; Misato shouted in panic.

The red Eva stood frozen as Unit 01 barreled into it knocking it on its 
butt. What happened then would have been comical if it hadn&#39;t been so 
bizarre. Unit 01 appeared to nuzzle Unit 02&#39;s face before curling up in 
an impossibly small ball on Unit 02&#39;s legs and settling down like a cat 
in a persons lap.

&quot;Asuka, are you okay?&quot; Misato called.

&quot;I-I think its p-purring,&quot; Asuka reported, obviously shaken and confused 
about what was happening. &quot;I-is Ranma okay?&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Several hours later, Unit 01 was back in its cage, swathed in huge 
bandages that were more necessary to cover the true nature of the Eva 
than for any injury. As yet, they hadn&#39;t been able to get the entry plug 
out and the techs were working hard to reestablish communication with 
the Eva&#39;s systems.

&quot;I&#39;ve got video from the inside of the entry plug, Ma&#39;am,&quot; a tech 
reported to Ritsuko.

&quot;Let&#39;s take a look,&quot; Ritsuko instructed.

A window opened up on the large monitor in front of them. It showed a 
scene that made everyone gasp. In the dim red emergency lighting of the 
entry plug, an empty plug suit floated in the LCL.

&quot;Dr. Akagi, what does it mean?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;I was afraid of something like this,&quot; Ritsuko sighed. &quot;This isn&#39;t the 
first time this has happened when the sync ratio has gone over 400 
percent.&quot;

&quot;You mean this has happened before?&quot; Maya gasped. &quot;How did they get the 
pilot back?&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t,&quot; Ritsuko said softly. &quot;Yui Ikari is still in there 
somewhere, part of Unit 01.&quot;

&quot;You mean, we&#39;ve lost Ranma?&quot; Maya asked, stunned by the revelation.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say that,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;They weren&#39;t able to get the other 
pilot back, but I have all their data to work with and I will get Ranma 
back.&quot;

&quot;O-okay, but I sure don&#39;t envy you having to tell Asuka and Misato about 
this,&quot; Maya said.

Ritsuko put her face in her hands and groaned tiredly.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;WHAT!&quot; Asuka shrieked. &quot;He can&#146;t be missing! He just can&#39;t be! Do you 
hear me? Ranma is not missing!&quot;

Ritsuko sighed. This was going to be as bad as she expected. Then she 
blinked in surprise as two slim hands grabbed hold of the lapels of her 
lab coat and she found herself pulled eye to crimson eye with the last 
person she expected to freak out about this.

&quot;You will get my Ranma back, Dr. Akagi,&quot; Rei said in a glacial voice 
that sent chills down Ritsuko&#39;s spine. &quot;Am I making myself clear? 
Failure is not an option. Is that understood?&quot;

Ritsuko was shocked at the cold certainty in the petite, blue-haired 
girl&#39;s voice. She was amazed at how intimidated she was by the teen. 
Wisely, she nodded emphatically.

&quot;Rei, it&#39;s not Ritsuko&#39;s fault,&quot; Misato said. &quot;Put her down. I&#39;m sure 
she will work as hard as possible to get Ranma back. He was...is her 
friend too. Right, Ritsuko?&quot;

&#39;Geez, even Misato sounds menacing,&#39; Ritsuko thought to herself as Rei 
released her before resuming her position beside Asuka and pulling the 
now crying redhead into a comforting hug.

&quot;That&#39;s right, Misato,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;I know you all care for Ranma. I 
do too. I will get him back. I promise.&quot;

&quot;So how did this happen, Ritsuko? What happened to Ranma that started 
this whole thing?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;What I&#39;m about to tell you goes no further than us,&quot; Ritsuko said 
seriously. &quot;You have to promise me none of you will take any action on 
what you&#39;re about to hear. I mean it. If you do anything out of the 
ordinary, we may never get Ranma back. Understood?&quot;

Ritsuko was clearly very serious and also very angry. The three other 
women nodded in agreement.

&quot;I managed to retrieve the data recorder from the fight,&quot; Ritsuko said. 
&quot;Someone apparently induced the Nekoken during the battle.&quot;

Misato and Asuka gasped.

&quot;Someone?&quot; Rei asked dispassionately.

&quot;I began to dig into the computers,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;He was good at 
covering his tracks, but not as good as I am. Luckily, he trusts me 
enough that he assumed I wouldn&#39;t have an issue with it.&quot;

&quot;Who did it?&quot; Misato growled.

&quot;It was Commander Ikari,&quot; Ritsuko stated. &quot;He sent a signal during the 
battle that activated the program. Ranma&#39;s display was suddenly filled 
with cats acting angry and aggressive. Ranma had no way to escape and 
his mind snapped. He went into the berserker condition the Nekoken 
training induces and his feral mind had no buffer between himself and 
the Eva. I believe it was then that he was absorbed into the Eva and the 
Eva began acting like a cat.&quot;

Ritsuko looked at the girls. It would have been funny had the situation 
not been so serious. They were both beyond angry, but they were still 
like polar opposites. Rei was sitting there, her crimson eyes alight 
with cold fury while Asuka&#39;s blue eyes burned with a fiery rage. Misato 
also looked mad enough to spit nails, but not nearly as angry as the 
girls.

&quot;Ranma was correct,&quot; Rei said. One could almost hear the derision and 
disgust in her tone, but not quite. &quot;The Commander is a terrible man.&quot;

&quot;A terrible man?&quot; Asuka spat. There was no missing her feelings on the 
matter. &quot;He&#39;s a no-good, back-stabbing bastard! He&#39;s a miserable piece 
of filth is what he is. He could have gotten us both killed! As it is he 
got Ranma absorbed into his Eva!&quot;

&quot;No arguments here,&quot; Misato agreed. &quot;So what do we do about this?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ritsuko said emphatically. &quot;If any of you do anything, the 
Commander will have you eliminated, even you Rei, and I may not be 
allowed to try and retrieve Ranma. We&#39;ll just watch him closely and work 
on getting Ranma back. Otherwise, we can&#39;t let on what we know.&quot;

&quot;This SUCKS!&quot; Asuka shouted then visibly calmed herself.

The others agreed silently.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma was sitting on a rock beside a waterfall in an idyllic forest of 
massive, ancient trees. He had been walking for what seemed like hours 
before he found this spot and he decided to pause for rest. He had no 
idea where he was or how he got here.

Suddenly, a woman appeared before him. She sported a familiar dark 
complexion and vertically-slitted eyes, like those of a furry demon from 
hell.

&quot;Bastet-sama? Where am I? What happened?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Greetings, my blessed one,&quot; Bastet smiled kindly. &quot;Currently you are 
absorbed in your Evangelion after Gendo Ikari induced the Nekoken in 
you. Don&#39;t worry, your cat-side defeated the angel and your beloveds are 
safe.&quot;

&quot;So how do I get back?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;As you know, at this point in Shinji&#39;s story, he was tempted to join 
with his Evangelion and escape his reality,&quot; Bastet explained. &quot;However, 
I&#39;ve co-opted this time to present you with an opportunity.&quot;

&quot;What opportunity?&quot; Ranma asked hesitantly. &quot;Are you going to send me 
home?&quot;

Bastet smiled at the obvious reluctance on Ranma&#39;s part to return to his 
own reality.

&quot;Not as yet, Blessed One,&quot; the goddess answered. &quot;Instead, I want to 
give you a chance to overcome your greatest weakness. I want to give you 
the chance to master the Nekoken.&quot;

&quot;B-but how?&quot; Ranma asked fearfully.

&quot;You must overcome your fear and prove your dominance over the cat 
spirit inside you,&quot; Bastet explained. The goddess gestured expansively 
to the forest around them. &quot;Somewhere out there is your cat spirit. You 
must hunt it down and subdue it. If you win, the Nekoken will be yours 
to command and you will be returned to Tokyo 3.&quot;

&quot;Will I still be afraid of c-c-cats?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Cats do not fear other cats,&quot; Bastet laughed in amusement. &quot;Unless the 
other cat is bigger and more dominant than they are. You will be the 
biggest and strongest cat of all so you will have no fear.&quot;

&quot;You mean I&#39;m going to turn into a c-c-cat?&quot; Ranma exclaimed.

&quot;Not per se,&quot; Bastet explained. &quot;You will become more cat-like mentally, 
more territorial and protective of those you consider as belonging to 
your pride. You will likely be a bit more aggressive when threatened and 
more playful and affectionate with those you love. You will also have 
the abilities of the Nekoken, the increased agility and reflexes, all 
the time. You&#39;ll be able to form the claws at will and your senses will 
be heightened greatly. You&#39;ll even find your night vision is far more 
acute.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too bad,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;But how will I overcome the 
fear?&quot;

&quot;That I cannot tell you,&quot; Bastet said. &quot;You must do that on your own. I 
will, however, say this, if you do not overcome it and the cat spirit 
achieves dominance, you will remain trapped in the Nekoken inside the 
Evangelion unable to return. The girls will miss you.&quot;

Bastet winked at him and vanished.

Ranma looked around nervously at the trees surrounding him. Somewhere 
out there was his worst fear personified. All he had to do is find it 
and defeat it. The pigtailed martial artist shuddered at the thought. 
How was he supposed to beat something that the mere sight of sent him 
screaming in abject terror?

Then something Bastet said hit him. If he didn&#39;t win, then Rei and Asuka 
would be hurt. Not only that, they would probably be killed. Ranma 
realized he wasn&#39;t just facing this for himself; he had to succeed for 
the girls he loved. How could he not defeat his fears with the girls&#39; 
lives hanging in the balance?

Resolve filled him as he stood up and made his way into the forest.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Oh, man,&quot; Ranma complained after having wandered around searching for 
some sign of his adversary for what seemed like days. &quot;How the heck am I 
supposed to find the thing?&quot;

As if in answer to his question, a deer suddenly burst from the trees 
and ran past him at top speed. Moments later, the object of Ranma&#39;s 
quest appeared from where the deer had come from. It instantly spotted 
Ranma and froze, looking at him warily.

Ranma also froze, trembling in terror. He wasn&#39;t sure what he was 
expecting, but this certainly wasn&#39;t it. Before him, tail lashing 
agitatedly from side to side, crouched an absolutely gigantic, brown and 
black tabby cat. It regarded him with vertically-slitted blue eyes and 
emitted a low rumbling growl. The furry demon had to weigh every bit as 
much as Ranma did and was sized proportionately.

Ranma gulped, trying desperately to quell his fear by grasping onto 
thoughts of Rei and Asuka, counter-balancing his fear of the cat with 
his fear of them dying because he was too weak to protect them.

&quot;I-I don&#39;t suppose you want to just give up quietly?&quot; Ranma stammered.

Another low growl was his answer.

&quot;I d-didn&#39;t think so,&quot; Ranma said, steeling himself and falling into a 
loose stance.

The cat saw this and laid its ears back against its head. It hissed 
threateningly at him and gathered itself, all the while tail lashing 
from side to side. Ranma quivered in dread at the sight.

&quot;Let&#39;s get this over with,&quot; Ranma said nervously.

Suddenly, the cat sprang. Ranma nearly peed himself but managed to leap 
to the side and land a quick kick to the cat&#39;s ribs. The cat whirled 
around with amazing agility and lashed out at Ranma with wickedly sharp 
claws. Ranma narrowly avoided them and the battle raged on.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;This had better work, Ritsuko,&quot; Misato growled as she stood in the 
control room flanked by Rei and Asuka.

It had been a month since Ranma had been absorbed into the Eva and it 
had taken them that long to prepare for the recovery procedure they were 
about to perform. Now everything was ready and Ritsuko prayed that it 
worked. She was deeply afraid that if they failed, the three females 
behind her would do something stupidly rash like flay the skin from 
Gendo Ikari&#39;s hide.

&quot;Start the procedure,&quot; Ritsuko commanded.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya said. &quot;Starting stage one of the recovery procedure 
now.&quot;

The techs monitoring the various readings began to call out reports. 
Things were going as expected for this stage of the process. Ritsuko 
gave the order to start stage two.

As stage two began to be implemented, things began to go wrong.

&quot;It&#39;s not working,&quot; Maya called out. &quot;His ego border seems to be trapped 
in a loop and is spinning out of control.&quot;

&quot;The radiation bombardment is being trapped. Pressure in the plug is 
rising!&quot; a tech called out.

&quot;Shut it down now!&quot; Ritsuko ordered.

&quot;I can&#39;t! It&#146;s not responding,&quot; Maya said.

&quot;Pressure in the plug is continuing to rise!&quot; the tech said.

&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Misato demanded.

&quot;It means we failed,&quot; Ritsuko said.

&quot;Plug pressure critical! The plug is going to be forced open!&quot; the tech 
reported moments before the main hatch burst open, spilling the LCL 
inside it over the floor.

&quot;NOOOO!&quot; Asuka screamed, running from the room with Rei and Misato just 
behind her.

She reached the Eva cage and fell to her knees before Ranma&#39;s empty plug 
suit. The redhead scooped it up and held it to her, sobbing 
uncontrollably. Misato knelt in front of her, also sobbing as she hugged 
the German girl.

Rei stood before Unit 01 staring at it.

&quot;Why won&#39;t you give him back?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;We need him with us. 
Please give him back.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma stood breathing heavily and dripping blood from various slashes 
that covered his torso. The battle had raged for days but now, at last, 
he stood over his adversary. The cat&#39;s fur was matted with blood, its 
ears notched and torn, claws broken. It had finally surrendered to him 
and was currently stretched out on its back with its throat and belly 
exposed in a posture of submission.

It was then that Ranma realized that the fear was gone. He no longer 
quaked in terror in the presence of the cat. He could even say the word 
without stuttering in dread.

Then, all around him, he heard the sound of women weeping. Amidst this, 
he heard a soft voice pleading.

&quot;Why won&#39;t you give him back?&quot; the voice said. It sounded like Rei. &quot;We 
need him with us. Please give him back.&quot;

Suddenly, Ranma felt a strange tugging sensation and he blacked out.

(oO\O/Oo)

Suddenly, with a wet flop, Ranma&#39;s unconscious naked body fell on the 
gantry in a pool of LCL before Rei.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Rei exclaimed, instantly kneeling and pulling him into her lap.

Misato and Asuka looked up in surprise, hardly daring to hope. They saw 
Rei holding Ranma and practically teleported over to them. Asuka was 
practically lying on top of him as she tried to embrace as much of him 
as she could. Misato claimed a hand and was grinning like a maniac as 
she watched Rei pillow Ranma&#39;s head in her lap and stroke his hair.

Ranma&#39;s eyes flickered open and he looked around.

&quot;Rei? Asuka? Misato? W-what&#39;s going on?&quot; Ranma asked groggily.

&quot;We almost lost you again, Idioten!&quot; Asuka sobbed in relief.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;How is he?&quot; Misato asked Ritsuko.

&quot;It&#146;s the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;Physically, 
he&#39;s more than healthy as always, but he&#39;s different now. Somehow, when 
his body reformed, there were some changes. His canines are slightly 
longer than normal, for instance, and his irises are slightly oval 
shaped, suggestive of a cat&#39;s eye. It gets more prominent when exposed 
to a bright light.&quot;

&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Well, while he was inside the Eva, he claimed he was forced to face his 
fears and master the Nekoken. He believes it&#39;s a manifestation of the 
feline traits that became part of him when he mastered the technique,&quot; 
Ritsuko answered.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;I checked his DNA and it&#39;s the same as before,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;I really 
can&#39;t think of a better explanation than that. I&#39;m not too concerned 
about it. The new features aren&#39;t really noticeable unless you look 
closely. He still looks perfectly human.&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot; Misato inquired.

&quot;His hearing seems to be much more acute and he says his sense of smell 
is much better than before,&quot; Ritsuko explained. &quot;He also claims that his 
personality might become more cat-like.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Misato drawled. &quot;If he starts spraying the furniture, I&#39;m 
having him neutered.&quot;

Ritsuko snickered.

&quot;Asuka and Rei may do very bad things to you if you did,&quot; the blonde 
pointed out. &quot;Anyway, I find the whole thing fascinating. I&#39;m very 
interested to see these cat-like personality traits when they manifest.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Misato said dryly. &quot;Being our resident cat freak 
and all. Just don&#39;t get caught &#39;petting&#39; him or there may be a &#39;cat&#39; 
fight.&quot;

&quot;That was bad, Misato, even for you,&quot; Ritsuko groaned.

Misato snickered.

&quot;When are you releasing him?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;He can go home tonight,&quot; Ritsuko said.

&quot;Good,&quot; Misato nodded. &quot;Good thing I have a date tonight or the yowling 
and purring that happens when the girls get their tomcat home might keep 
me up all night.&quot;

Ritsuko slapped her hand to her face and shook her head in dismay at the 
lame &#39;cat&#39; euphemisms. Apparently, Misato was going to be unbearable to 
be around for a while. She briefly wondered if it would be celebrated as 
a public service if she brained the purple-haired twit before she 
cracked any more goofy cat jokes.

&quot;SEELE won&#39;t be happy to hear about what happened with Unit 01,&quot; Kaji 
drawled. &quot;What will you tell them?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;It&#39;s not as if we could have 
anticipated what happened. It was completely unforeseen and we were in 
no way responsible. We have frozen Unit 01 for the time being and it 
will remain frozen pending further orders from SEELE.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure SEELE will be pleased to hear it,&quot; Kaji said. &quot;You are 
fortunate that Unit 02 only suffered minor damage since Unit 00 is still 
being repaired. At least you&#39;re not completely vulnerable.&quot;

&quot;Unit 00 will be back to operational readiness within a week,&quot; Fuyutsuki 
said. &quot;We will be ready for the next attack.&quot;

&quot;I certainly hope so,&quot; Kaji said as he left.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat on the couch at the Katsuragi asylum sandwiched between two 
affectionate girls. Asuka giggled as Ranma actually began to purr as one 
of them played with his hair and the other rubbed his belly.

&quot;Variable-chan, promise you won&#146;t ever leave us,&quot; Asuka said softly.

The purring stopped and they felt Ranma tense.

&quot;I-I-I promise I won&#146;t ever leave either of you of my own free will,&quot; 
Ranma stammered.

&quot;Ranma, what is wrong?&quot; Rei said, picking up on Ranma&#39;s conflicted 
state.

The pigtailed martial artist was silent for several minutes before 
giving both girls an affectionate squeeze.

&quot;I guess you both deserve to know the truth,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Please 
believe me when I say I love you both more than anything or anyone I 
have ever loved. Hell, I&#39;d give up the art for you two if I had to.&quot;

Both girls looked at him curiously, confused about where this was going 
but thrilled that he would put them before his beloved art.

&quot;The truth is, I am not from this reality,&quot; Ranma said nervously.

&quot;What are you talking about, Variable-chan?&quot; Asuka demanded.

&quot;I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but I was sent here by a goddess to give 
me a break from the pressures I was being put under back where I came 
from,&quot; Ranma explained.

&quot;You were sent here on vacation?&quot; Asuka blinked incredulously. &quot;I know 
you&#39;ve told me about your life before you came here, but coming here 
where you are fighting for your life against angels is supposed to be a 
vacation? What kind of insane life did you have before?&quot;

&quot;Believe me, it has been a vacation,&quot; Ranma said ruefully. &quot;Back where I 
came from I had no real friends, just people that wanted to use me to 
make their own dreams come true. Even my parents were like that. My pop 
was out to live a life of leisure off of my blood and sweat. I had to 
hide from my own mother who hasn&#39;t seen her son in 11 years so she 
wouldn&#39;t find out about my curse and demand I commit seppuku for not 
being a man among men, thanks to a contract my pop made with her when he 
took me on a ten year martial arts training trip. The contract said he 
would make me a man among men or we&#39;d both commit seppuku. He got me to 
sign it by telling me I was finger painting. I was 6 at the time.&quot;

&quot;What kind of idioten would do something like that?&quot; Asuka demanded. 
&quot;And what kind of pathetic excuse for a mother would make her own child 
commit seppuku just because they didn&#39;t live up to her standards?&quot;

&quot;Apparently, mine,&quot; Ranma said sadly. &quot;But that&#39;s not all. Thanks to my 
father&#39;s lack of honor and integrity, he sold my hand in marriage every 
time he got the chance. When I left, I had three girls after me with 
legitimate claims and who knows how many more that just hadn&#39;t found me 
yet. I can&#39;t marry any of them with out someone losing their honor and 
starting a blood feud. I lived with one of them. She was the one that 
was constantly accusing me of being a womanizing pervert and hitting me 
with a mallet.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; Asuka said as Rei listened passively.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; Ranma shook his head. &quot;And it still gets worse. Each of 
the girls actively pursuing me came with her own jealous suitor. None of 
the guys understand that I&#39;m not interested in the girl they want and 
they constantly attack me thinking that if they beat me they will get 
the girl they are after. Some of them are almost as powerful as I am. 
There&#39;s barely a day that goes by that I&#39;m not randomly attacked by a 
jealous suitor, someone my pop ripped off, or just some bizarre martial 
artist that wants to test their skill against the best.&quot;

Asuka and Rei struggled to comprehend what that sort of life would be 
like, but Ranma went on.

&quot;Then where I go to school, there&#39;s a freakin&#39; insane upperclassmen that 
thinks because he comes from a Samurai family and has a ton of money 
that every girl wants him. He firmly believes that the fianc&eacute;e I live 
with and my female side are in love with him and the only thing keeping 
them from running to his arms is that my boy side has them under an evil 
spell that makes them act like they hate him. He has an equally insane 
sister that wants my guy side and hates my girl side. I haven&#39;t been 
able to convince either of them that my girl side and boy side are the 
same person.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just crazy,&quot; Asuka stammered. &quot;Does it get any worse?&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s about it, aside from none of them give a damn about what I want 
or what my dreams might be,&quot; Ranma sighed, &quot;and they all use my honor 
against me. Do you believe me?&quot;

&quot;That story is too crazy for you to have made it up,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;And 
then there&#39;s your curse. I suppose it&#39;s no harder to believe that than 
the curse. But why are you telling us this?&quot;

&quot;Because when this is all over and my job here is done, I might get 
pulled back to my reality,&quot; Ranma said somberly. &quot;I don&#39;t want to. I 
want to stay here with you two, but the choice may not be mine.&quot;

&quot;What is your job here?&quot; Rei asked.

Ranma looked at Rei.

&quot;I was sent here to stop Gendo Ikari and SEELE from wiping out everyone 
on the planet when they try to initiate the Third Impact,&quot; Ranma said. 
He watched as Rei&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;I know what they have planned and I 
need your help to stop it. I never counted on falling in love with you 
both, but you&#39;re the only girls I&#39;ve ever met that wanted me for who I 
am and not because of some stupid obligation.&quot;

Both Rei and Asuka were looking at Ranma with confusion in their eyes. 
They didn&#39;t know how to take what they had just been told. Ranma sighed 
sadly.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I never meant to hurt either of you. 
It&#39;s just that when I came here I didn&#39;t think there was any chance I&#39;d 
be going back. It wasn&#39;t until after we were already involved that the 
goddess responsible for my being here contacted me. It wasn&#39;t until then 
that I even had a clue why I was here. The first time she talked to me 
was when I was trapped inside the 12th angel. Most recently, she 
contacted me again when I was absorbed into Unit 01. She never said if I 
was going to be returned, but I think it could be a possibility.

&quot;Anyway, I really do love you both more than life itself, but I can 
understand if you hate me after what I&#39;ve just told you. I think I need 
to go to bed now. Goodnight.&quot;

Ranma swiftly stood up and headed for his room before they could see the 
tears running down his face. Rei and Asuka looked at each other, stunned 
by what they had been told.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;What have you found out?&quot; the old woman asked as she sat on a park 
bench with her small dog.

&quot;I&#39;ve found a credible source of information that pretty much spelled 
out the whole plan,&quot; Kaji said. &quot;He is working from the inside to stop 
them, but he made contact with me to request our help when the time 
comes. It&#39;s all detailed on the disk.&quot;

&quot;How reliable is your source?&quot; the old woman asked.

&quot;From what I&#39;ve been able to confirm, he&#39;s completely reliable,&quot; Kaji 
said.

&quot;Very well, I will pass the data on to those who will make a decision,&quot; 
the old woman said.

&quot;My source requests a decision on whether help will be rendered be made 
soon as he is unsure of the timetable,&quot; Kaji said. &quot;As soon as they 
decide, contact me and I&#39;ll pass on the information.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the old woman said as she stood and walked off with her 
dog.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma had been laying on his bed for a good fifteen minutes, tears 
flowing down his face from the emotional pain he was in. He knew he had 
lost the two people he loved the most, just as he had lost everything 
else in his life that he really cared about.

Suddenly he was ripped from his self-pity by his door slamming open. 
Asuka stalked in followed less aggressively, but with a similar look of 
resolve, by Rei. Ranma quickly wiped the tears away in a futile effort 
to hide them.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Asuka demanded.

&quot;Um...going to bed?&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Without us?&quot; Asuka demanded.

&quot;I...um...didn&#39;t think you would want me with you after I told you what 
I did,&quot; Ranma answered.

&quot;Idioten!&quot; Asuka snapped. &quot;Do you think we&#39;re so shallow that we&#39;d stop 
loving you because of that?&quot;

&quot;B-but I might get taken from you,&quot; Ranma hedged.

&quot;Then it is important that we have as much time as we can together,&quot; Rei 
said.

Ranma didn&#39;t know what to say. He nearly sobbed in relief that they 
still wanted to be with him. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t need to say anything 
as he was pulled up and dragged to the girls&#39; bedroom where a splash of 
water was applied before the girls got frisky.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;That was so beautiful,&quot; Kasumi said tearfully when Nabiki stopped the 
tape. &quot;I&#39;m so happy for Ranma. I really hope Bastet-sama allows him to 
stay with those two.&quot;

The fianc&eacute;es and Nodoka said nothing as they looked down in shame. 
Nabiki could almost feel sorry for them, but she felt Ranma was spot on 
with his assessment of them.

&quot;Foolish boy,&quot; Genma moaned. &quot;How could he disrespect his father so? And 
crying like a simpering little girl over those stupid girls. It&#39;s 
shameful!&quot;

&quot;Saotome,&quot; Nabiki growled. &quot;You&#39;re about two more words away from having 
a cold-water experience. Those casts will feel awfully tight on your 
panda form I bet.&quot;

Genma paled and snapped his mouth shut.

Cologne just shook her head at the stupid male&#39;s antics. It was males 
like him that validated the Amazon way of life.</pre>
