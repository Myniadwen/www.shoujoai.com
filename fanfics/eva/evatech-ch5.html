<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 5 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>

<a href="../eva/evatech-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Asuka blinked, realizing that she was still laying on the 
bed, Rei sort of laying there right beside her. The blue haired girl 
had a slight smile on her face, and with a feeling of dread she 
wondered what Rei was thinking about.

        &quot;I ran your uniform through the wash,&quot; Rei got up, not 
incidentally giving Asuka a nice view of her breasts again, &quot;I&#39;ll go 
see if they&#39;re dry yet.&quot; Her little T-shirt rose up a bit as she 
walked away, giving Asuka another nice view of white cotton panties.

        &quot;What&#39;s coming over me?&quot; Asuka muttered to herself softly.

        Rei Ayanami closed the bedroom door behind her with a sigh, 
leaning up against the door for a moment. A bit of a flush was on 
her normally pale cheeks, a little smile on her face. When she and 
Shinji had made the decision to drop Asuka off at her apartment, she 
hadn&#39;t really thought too much about it. Asuka was so badly drunk, 
getting to the orange haired lieutenant own quarters was simply out 
of the question.

        Rei sent Shinji on home, then got Asuka over to her bedroom. 
Stripping the uniform off of a limply drunk body was difficult, so 
much so that at first she hadn&#39;t really been paying much attention 
to what was being revealed. But while pulling the undershirt off, 
the bouncing of Asuka&#39;s breasts had suddenly riveted her attention.

        The lacy white bra held those two orbs fully contained, and 
for a moment Rei thought it might be wiser to just leave it on. &#39;It 
wouldn&#39;t be too comfortable to sleep in,&#39; Rei had to admit. She 
reached around Asuka&#39;s body, searching for the clasp of the bra and 
not incidentally pressing their two bodies close together.

        &quot;Mmm,&quot; Asuka&#39;s soft voice said as she stirred slightly, and 
Rei froze. A warm breath brushing her ear, &quot;You smell good.&quot;

        &quot;Asuka?&quot; Rei murmured softly, her heart beating faster with 
fear as Rei sat there frozen, but Asuka didn&#39;t stir once again. 
After a moment of fumbling with the clasp Rei undid the bra, pulling 
the lacy number off a bit clumsily only to stop, blushing. Round, 
healthy orbs, surprisingly stiff nipples thrusting up into the air.

        Blushing furiously Rei had pulled her eyes away from them, 
but the image was still burned into her mind&#39;s eye. She had pulled 
Asuka&#39;s boots off earlier, and with now shaking hands undid the 
snaps for her uniform pants. They easily slid down Asuka&#39;s long, 
smooth legs and off, fluttering to the floor. As Rei looked up from 
her work she saw the delicate panties that matched the now discarded 
bra and blushed even harder.

        &#39;The panties had best stay on,&#39; Rei thought, still blushing 
faintly as she covered Asuka with a sheet. &#39;Guess it&#39;s my turn,&#39; she 
mused..

        Undressing Rei found herself oddly aware of the sensations 
of her own body, feeling the fabrics of her uniform sliding against 
her shin. Jacket, shirt hit the floor, then she paused. Blushing she 
unclipped her own white, frilly bra and set it with her clothes. Her 
pants slid down, then she peeled her socks off before taking a half 
step towards the bed.

        &#39;I can&#39;t do it,&#39; Rei stopped, then she turned around, 
quickly pulling a oversized T-shirt from her dresser drawer. She 
slid it on over her nudity, noting that it at least preserved her 
modesty, mostly. The bed was surprisingly warm as Rei slid into the 
bed beside Asuka, while still carefully maintaining some distance 
between them.

        Rei smiled to herself slightly, pushing off from the door 
and going down the hall to where the small laundry was working away. 
She had slept remarkably soundly last night, only awakening at one 
point to find herself curled up with Asuka holding her close. A few 
terror filled seconds later the still soundly Asuka let her go, 
leaving Rei feeling both relieved and a bit disappointed.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on,&quot; Rei murmured to herself 
softly as she pulled the clothes out of the dryer and into a 
basket, &quot;But I think I like it.&quot;

        Out in Macross city itself a young man winced in the 
artificial sunlight. &quot;That&#39;s the last time I go out drinking with 
Asuka,&quot; Shinji Ikari muttered to himself softly, shielding his eyes.

        &quot;Shinji!&quot; a happy voice cried, and he groaned softly. Dr. 
Gendo Ikari came around the corner at a trot, looking typically 
manic as the scraggly haired man gave his son an intense gaze, &quot;Why 
haven&#39;t you been down to try my newest prototypes?&quot;

        Shinji gave him a look, having long ago developed an 
immunity to his father&#39;s attempts to guilt trip him. &quot;Because they 
blow up far too often,&quot; he answered dryly.

        &quot;A statistical blip,&quot; Gendo waved his hand casually, &quot;I just 
had a run of bad luck.&quot;

        &#39;Five planes is a run of bad luck?&#39; Shinji thought, 
sweatdropping. &quot;I&#39;ll try to make it down to your lab soon,&quot; he 
offered, silently adding, &#39;like next year, maybe.&#39;

        &quot;Then I&#39;ll make sure to have my new Super-Evangelion ready 
for you to test,&quot; Gendo said dramatically, his glasses glinting 
oddly in the sun. With that he was gone, running down the street 
with his while labcoat fluttering behind him like some kind of cape.

        &quot;He&#39;s really freaking me out,&quot; Shinji sighed softly.

        There was a loud gurgle, and Shinji looked down at his 
loudly protesting belly in surprise. &#39;Guess I haven&#39;t eaten yet.&#39; 
Looking about he spotted a familiar looking restaurant and headed 
inside the Little White Dragon.

        &quot;Welcome,&quot; the older woman he had met last night beamed. She 
tilted her head to the side thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;re one of Asuka&#39;s 
friends, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Shinji smiled, his short brown hair falling into 
his eyes.

        &quot;Minmei,&quot; the woman cried, &quot;we have a customer!&quot;

        &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; the black haired Chinese smiled once she saw 
him. She picked up a menu and walked him over to a corner table, 
waving him to a seat. She handed him the menu and bowed, her school 
girl&#39;s uniform rustling, &quot;We&#39;re currently serving breakfast dishes, 
and would you like me to go get you a cup off coffee?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, please,&quot; Shinji smiled, watching with a certain amount 
of admiration as she trotted away. &#39;She sure is cute,&#39; he noted.

        Going into the back room Minmei turned, clearly noticing him 
watching her. Shinji blushed brightly, expecting her to raise some 
kind of fuss, but instead she just gave him a sunny smile before the 
door closed behind her.

        &#39;I though that she and Asuka..&#39; Shinji blinked in surprise. 
Still, Asuka hadn&#39;t seemed too thrilled by the girl&#39;s attentions 
yesterday, so maybe they really weren&#39;t a couple. &#39;Mot that she&#39;d be 
interested in me,&#39; he thought glumly.

        &quot;Here you are,&quot; Minmei poured him the large cup of coffee, 
and Shinji breathed deep in the strong scent happily. Minmei gave 
him a gently sympathetic look before saying, &quot;Asuka took you out for 
drinks and kareoke, right?&quot;

        Shinji looked at her in surprise, &quot;How did you know that?&quot;

        Minmei smiled at him suddenly, &quot;Because I went out with her 
once and tried to keep up with her drinking.&quot; The delicate Chinese 
girl shuddered, &quot;Never again. I like her, but they are limits&quot;

        &#39;Like,&#39; Shinji noted, &#39;she didn&#39;t say love.&#39; Before Minmei 
left he mustered his most charming smile, &quot;Would you like to sit 
with me?&quot;

        Minmei hesitated, looking him up and down thoughtfully. 
Finally she smiled slightly, &quot;Well, all right.&quot; She fixed him with a 
look, &quot;Just don&#39;t get any funny ideas.&quot;

        &quot;Perish the thought,&quot; Shinji smiled.

        On the bridge of the SDF-1 things were smoothly organized 
chaos, as ever. Misato was quietly sleeping off a hangover over in 
the command chair, Ritsuko and Maya had a wedding catalog spread out 
over their consoles, and poor Makoto was sweatdropping slightly.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad things have been quiet lately,&quot; he muttered to 
himself softly.

        &quot;What was that?&quot; Ritsuko fixed the young man with a look.

        &quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; Makoto waved his hands frantically.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Ritsuko turned back to Maya and smiled gently, &quot;So 
what color of dress did you want, darling?&quot;

        &quot;White for both of us, Sempai,&quot; Maya beamed up at her.

        &quot;I thought you had to be a virgin to wear white,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s 
smile turned wicked, &quot;and I know when I was done with you, you were 
no virgin.&quot;

        &quot;Sempai!&quot; Maya blushed furiously, covering the older woman&#39;s 
mouth with a hand.

        &quot;That was too much information,&quot; Misato grumbled from her 
seat before pulling her cap back down over her eyes.
