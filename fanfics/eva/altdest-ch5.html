<h1>Altered Destinies (part 5 of 19)</h1>

<a href="../eva/altdest-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Shinji Ikari bowed slightly as she was quickly
introduced to the school&#39;s principal, then was excused
as the older man discretely oggled Misato in her
slinky dress. Absentmindedly he gave Shinji permission
to look around and the young lady left, smiling wryly
at Misato&#39;s easy ability to manipulate a man like him.

The building, like much of the city was new
construction, and felt oddly deserted as she walked
the halls, occasionally looking into windows. &#39;With
the Angel attack I guess most of the people with good
sense are leaving,&#39; she thought, &#39;unlike myself.&#39;

&quot;What are you doing here, young lady?&quot; a clearly
annoyed voice asked.

Shinji turned to face the older man, recognizing a
teacher as soon as she saw one. She handed him the
pass she had been give as she said respectfully, &quot;Just
looking around, sensei.&quot;

He looked at the paper, clearly wanting something to
be wrong with it. He looked up, light flashing off his
glasses as he handed the sheet over as he reluctantly
said, &quot;All right, but please do not disrupt classes,
young lady.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Shinji nodded.

&quot;Hmph,&quot; he turned and strode away just as the bell
announcing lunch rang, doors sliding open even as
students streamed out of the classrooms.

&#39;Uh oh,&quot; reflexedly Shinji made her way outside, not
wanting to deal with the students just yet. She smiled
wryly noting that Misato wasn&#39;t back at the car yet,
which meant she was still negotiating with the
principal.

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; a boy&#39;s voice called and Shinji turned to
see three figures heading over two her. The tallest
was gangly, with dark brown hair while a smaller,
blonde haired boy followed beside him. Along with the
two boys a lighter brown haired girl paced beside them
reluctantly, giving Shinji a mildly apologetic smile.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Shinji asked, the young lady looking at the
three with mild curiosity.

&quot;You transferring here?&quot; the taller boy asked bluntly.

&quot;Toji!&quot; the girl scolded then looked over at Shinji.
&quot;Don&#39;t mind him, he just has no manners,&quot; she smiled,
&quot;I&#39;m Hikari, this is Toji and Aida.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Aida beamed, offering his hand awkwardly.

Shinji shook it, feeling a bit of amusement in the
whole situation. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she addressed the
three of them as a group. She looked over at Toji,
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m transferring unless my guardian decides
otherwise.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll look forward to you being our classmate,&quot;
Hikari said gently.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Aida sighed, blushing faintly.

Toji rolled his eyes at that. &quot;You heard about the
giant robot that saved the city a few nights back?&quot; he
asked, looking at Shinji thoughtfully.

Shinji played dumb, &quot;What robot?&quot;

Before Toji or anyone else could follow up a voice
called out, &quot;Shin-chan!&quot; Misato strode over, both
young men following her every move. She seemed not to
notice the stares or Hikari&#39;s frown, &quot;Making new
friends?&quot;

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Shinji answered, &quot;these are Hikari, Toji
and Aida.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she smiled, then Misato turned to
Shinji. &quot;All done, you&#39;re starting here tomorrow,&quot; she
beamed.

&quot;Are you going to be driving Shinji to school?&quot; Aida
asked a bit dazedly.

&quot;No, we&#39;re near enough for her to walk,&quot; Misato
shrugged casually.

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Toji murmured only to have Hikari elbow him
in the ribs, &quot;ow!&quot;

&quot;Sorry to cut this short,&quot; Misato shrugged, &quot;but I&#39;ve
got to take Shinji out shopping for school supplies.&quot;
She popped the doors and climbed in, &quot;See you later.&quot;

&quot;It was nice to meet you,&quot; Shinji nodded hesitantly
then climbed in after Misato.

&quot;You didn&#39;t get to ask her if she was the pilot of
that robot,&quot; Aida said as the cherry red sportscar
swept out of the lot with style.

&quot;You two,&quot; Hikari shook her head. &quot;You&#39;ve got to get
to know her a bit, you know.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Toji shrugged, &quot;but either way I have to
know.&quot; He cracked his knuckles, a smile teasing his
lips, &quot;And if she is the pilot I&#39;ll pay her back in
full.&quot;

Unaware that she was the topic of conversation back in
the parking lot Shinji looked over at Misato, &quot;Isn&#39;t
starting classes tomorrow a bit fast?&quot;

&quot;NERV has a lot of pull,&quot; Misato shrugged casually,
&quot;it wasn&#39;t that hard to get you in fast.&quot; She looked
over, apparently unconcerned by oncoming traffic and
smiled, &quot;I think that blonde kid was checking you
out.&quot;

&quot;Aida?&quot; Shinji blinked, then whimpered as they nearly
missed another car. &quot;I think they&#39;d be curious about
any new girl,&quot; she shrugged.

Misato chuckled softly, &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

In NERV headquarters was a shadowy chamber, on the
floor inscribed with patterns and designs as old as
man. Gendo Ikari looked out at the Geofront, taking in
the structures that held the buildings of the city
when they were pulled underground for defensive
purposes.

&quot;Ritsuko,&quot; Gendo turned to the woman who stood in
front of his desk, &quot;how are repairs for the Unit-01
going?&quot;

&quot;Ahead of schedule,&quot; Ritsuko said, &quot;we&#39;ll be ready to
sortie again in only a few days.&quot;

&quot;Unit-00?&quot; Gendo asked.

&quot;We&#39;re thawing it out of cryogenic storage and
attempting to discover what went wrong last time,&quot;
Ritsuko reported crisply. She hesitated, &quot;Normally I&#39;d
assume that there was pilot error involved, but this
is Rei we&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Gendo nodded.

&#39;Ask about her,&#39; Ritsuko silently urged the oddly
impassive man standing in front of her, &#39;you know you
want to, damn it.&#39;

Gruffly, almost unwillingly Gendo asked, &quot;And how is
Shinji?&quot;

&quot;Settling in nicely,&quot; Ritsuko started.

&quot;I meant in relation to NERV,&quot; Gendo cut her off.

Ritsuko fought not to roll her eyes. &quot;Her training
sessions in the simulator are going well,&quot; she
answered crisply, &quot;it seems that Shinji is very nearly
a natural pilot.&quot;

&quot;Unit-02 will soon be arriving from Germany,&quot; Gendo
said seriously, &quot;along with it&#39;s pilot Asuka Langley
Sorryu. I want both EVAs fully operational by the time
she arrives.&quot;

&quot;Expecting another enemy attack?&quot; Ritsuko asked him,
her shoulders tensing up slightly as she wondered if
Gendo has some kind of inside knowledge. &#39;It really
wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&#39; she thought to herself grimly.

Gendo&#39;s expression was nearly unreadable, &quot;It&#39;s always
best to be prepared, doctor.&quot;

&#39;That was helpful,&#39; Ritsuko thought. &quot;Of course, sir,&quot;
she agreed aloud and was soon excused.

Gendo returned to his seat, his expression
contemplative. &quot;Fuyutsuki?&quot; he asked and a slim figure
emerged from the shadowy corners of the room. He
almost looked like a professor despite the NERV
uniform, but his eyes were shrewd.

&quot;Yes Gendo?&quot; Commander Fuyutsuki asked.

&quot;In addition to Misato and Ritsuko&#39;s reports I want
surveillance maintained on Shinji,&quot; Gendo ordered
crisply.

&quot;You think she&#39;ll be targeted?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked.

&quot;As our only active pilot Shinji is too precious to
lose,&quot; Gendo answered.

&quot;And the fact that she resembles your wife Yui has
nothing to do with it.&quot;

&quot;Nothing at all,&quot; Gendo smiled back reluctantly.</pre>
