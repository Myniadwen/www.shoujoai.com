<h1>Third Genesis (part 24 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Misato looked up in surprise as Himiko entered her
office, her black hair falling into her eyes. &quot;Yes?&quot;
the commander of NERV asked her, trying rather weakly
to sort the papers on her desk into some kind of
order.

&quot;There&#39;s been an emergency call from the hospital,&quot;
Himiko Yamato&#39;s ash gray hair fell into her eyes as
she reported breathlessly, &quot;Shinji Ikari is awake.&quot;

Misato looked at her blankly a moment then was out of
her desk like a shot. &quot;You&#39;re with me,&quot; she barked as
she grabbed her red jacket and lead the way out of the
office and down the hallway, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;But someone has to be here to watch the office,&quot;
Himiko followed, her casual blue dress matching the
color of her eyes.

&quot;I need someone on the phone while I drive,&quot; Misato
said as the elevator descended, letting them out in
the underground parking. &quot;Here,&quot; she pulled her
cellphone out of her pocket and smoothly handed it to
Himiko.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Himiko gave in, seeing that Misato was
quite determined. The doors to the little red
sportscar popped open automatically as they neared and
they climbed in. With a squeal of tires Misato was
off, the car swiftly emerging into daylight.

&quot;Get Ritsuko and Maya first,&quot; Misato ordered as she
raced them through the streets of Tokyo-3, &quot;tell them
to meet us at the hospital. If there&#39;s anything odd
going on, Ritsuko is going to be needed to find out
why.&quot;

&quot;Already dialing,&quot; Himiko nodded, &quot;should I yank Rei
and Asuka out of school?&quot;

Whipping them around a corner so sharply that Himiko
squeaked in alarm Misato said, &quot;No, it&#39;s not an
emergency yet, and I want to see what shape Shinji is
before they see him.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am.&quot; Himiko reached Ritsuko as the car hit a bump,
&quot;Shinji Ikari has awakened, Misato and I are already
en-route and she want you to meet us there.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Ritsuko answered crisply, &quot;any news on him
mental state?&quot;

&quot;The doctor said he was acting strangely,&quot; Himiko said
for both Ritsuko and Misato&#39;s benefit, &quot;but other than
that...&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Ritsuko said, &quot;I&#39;ll grab Maya and meet
you there.&quot;

&#39;I wonder how she&#39;ll grab her?&#39; Misato thought with a
little smirk as she dangerously whipped the car around
a corner.

&quot;Eep!&quot; Himiko held on to the dashboard for dear life
as they ran another red light,. sending other cars
squealing aside dangerously.

&quot;Ah ha!&quot; Misato gunned the car one more time before
yanking the wheel and skidding to a stop in one of the
hospital parking spaces. She sprung out onto the
pavement only to look back once she realized Himiko
wasn&#39;t moving, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Carefully Himiko pried her fingers from the car as she
sighed, &quot;Give me a moment to catch my breath, boss,&quot;

&quot;Wuss,&quot; Misato chuckled as they strode inside.

They hit the elevator and rose it upstairs, Misato
tapping her booted foot impatiently as they hurried.
The hallways were mostly clear as they ran towards the
suite, Ritsuko and Maya hurrying up the other hallway
to meet them there.

A young doctor stood there nervously by the door, his
brown hair messy and his lab coat slightly askew.
&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; he saluted nervously.

&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; Misato demanded, looking every
inch the commander as they nearly surrounded the man.

&quot;Uhm,&quot; he looked vaguely uncomfortable, tugging at his
tie nervously. A deep breath and he said, &quot;You might
want to go in, it would be simpler than trying to
explain.&quot;

Ritsuko frowned, &quot;Don&#39;t play games with us, young
man....&quot;

Misato stopped her with a wave of her hand, a similar
frown on her face. &quot;All right,&quot; she said to him
crisply, &quot;but this better be good.&quot; She pushed the
door open, leading into a quite normal looking
hospital room.

The white window curtains blew gently in the breeze,
bright morning sunlight streaming in to light up the
figure who was sitting up there on the bed. Shinji
Ikari&#146;s dark hair was messy and his eyes were round
with alarm. He looked up as they came in, his chin
coming up confidently as he studied the four of them
intently.

&#39;He doesn&#39;t seem to recognize us at all,&#39; Misato
thought worriedly as she studied the boy, &#39;does he
have some kind of amnesia?&#39;

&quot;I thought that I asked for the commander of NERV,&quot;
Shinji finally said to them coldly, &quot;so where is Gendo
Ikari?&quot;

Misato thought about softening the blow a bit but
decided against it. &quot;Gendo Ikari is dead,&quot; she said,
&quot;my name is Misato Katsuragi, and I&#39;m the head of
NERV.&quot;

It took Shinji a moment to digest that piece of
information before quietly saying, &quot;Then I&#39;m sorry,
ma&#39;am.&quot; He looked up at them with a wry smile as he
said, &quot;My name is Yui Ikari, and I think I really need
your help.&quot;

&quot;Yui Ikari?&quot; Maya echoed weakly while the others
looked on in surprise.

Not long after they were holding a hasty meeting
outside of the hospital room while the patient was
being given a lunch that was mostly made up of mushed
food. &quot;So what do you all think?&quot; Misato asked, hands
shoved in her jacket pockets.

&quot;If it is a delusion it&#39;s a remarkably consistent
one,&quot; Ritsuko answered her, &quot;the information I could
quiz him on all matched up.&quot;

&quot;It was a bit eerie when he finally recognized me as
Dr. Katsuragi&#39;s daughter,&quot; Misato murmured to herself
softly.

&quot;Is it possible...&quot; Himiko started tentatively.

&quot;We think that Gendo intended to shift Yui&#39;s
consciousness out of the EVA-01 and into the human Rei
Ayanami clone,&quot; Ritsuko admitted, &quot;it could be that he
missed.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s one hell of a miss,&quot; Maya muttered.

&quot;It would explain why Rei thought that Shinji was in
EVA-01,&quot; Misato shook her head, &quot;along with the Rei
consciousness.&quot;

&quot;We need to get anyone who knew Yui previously in
here, especially Prof. Fuyutsuki,&quot; Ritsuko said
thoughtfully, &quot;it may be the only way to confirm her
identity.&quot;

&quot;Assuming he IS Yui,&quot; Himiko said a bit nervously,
&quot;what do we do about it?&quot;

&quot;Good question,&quot; Misato sighed.

&quot;I&#39;d better start digging through Gendo&#39;s encrypted
files,&quot; Ritsuko said to herself grimly, &quot;maybe he has
more details there.&quot;

&quot;Maybe under &#39;Human Instrumentality Project&#39; files,&quot;
Maya offered, &quot;from what I&#39;ve found in the accounting
data he put a lot of project money in there.&quot;

&quot;Do that,&quot; Misato nodded firmly.

There was the sound of running footsteps in the
hallway and they saw Rei and Asuka hurrying down the
hallway towards them. Both young women were still in
their school uniforms, Asuka looking tough in her
boy&#39;s costume while Rei&#39;s skirt swirled around her
legs.

&quot;Someone at headquarters said that Shinji was awake?&quot;
Asuka asked, her long orange hair falling around her
face. &quot;Why weren&#39;t we called out from school?&quot;

&quot;Is Shinji all right?&quot; Rei asked, the blue haired
young woman looking at them in concern.

&quot;It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that,&quot; Misato said
wryly, &quot;and as it wasn&#39;t an emergency, I thought we
should hold off on getting you out of classes.&quot;

&quot;Shinji either believes he&#39;s Yui Ikari,&quot; Ritsuko
explained to them simply, &quot;or he&#39;s been possessed by
Yui&#39;s consciousness, depending on how you look at it.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Asuka blinked.</pre>
