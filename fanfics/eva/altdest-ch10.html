<h1>Altered Destinies (part 10 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>

<a href="../eva/altdest-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;We&#39;re nearly there,&quot; Misato called back from where
she sat in the copilot&#39;s seat, the black haired woman
dressed in her usual red jacket and black dress.

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya Ibuki answered with stiff
formally, the younger woman holding on to her seat
nervously. She looked almost as boyish as Shinji could
with her short black hair and crisp uniform, something
that she seemed mostly unaware of.

&quot;Thank you for coming, Ms Ibuki,&quot; Shinji Ikari said
quietly from where the girl sat across from Maya, Her
long black hair was tied back neatly in a ponytail,
and in deference to the upcoming first meeting she
wore a comfortable skirt in blue.

&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Maya answered promptly, &quot;when I
heard that Dr. Akagi wanted another officer along I
willingly volunteered.&quot; As she spoke of Ritsuko there
was a gentling in her tone and manner, her eyes nearly
sparking.

Rei Ayanami, as usual, was silent as the white clad
girl gazed out the window at the naval vessels that
grew slowly larger up ahead of them. None of them had
really expected the withdrawn pilot to go when Misato
offered her the chance, but remarkably she had agreed.
Of course that made some problems with Commander
Ikari, but in the end he had been swayed by curiosity
regarding the unusual connection growing between
Shinji and Rei.

Dropping her voice a bit Shinji asked Maya, &quot;Is Misato
really qualified to be up there sitting in the copilot
seat?&quot;

In a quite normal tone of voice Maya answered her,
&quot;Major Katsuragi is qualified to pilot a helicopter.&quot;
Dropping her voice a lot she added, &quot;Now how good she
is at it, I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Misato&#39;s voice carried into the rear
cabin.

Out the window they saw the vessels of the pacific
fleet stretched out below them, many aircraft carriers
and battleships belonging to the various great powers
of the world. Of course in this modern age they were
completely obsolete, but it seemed to comfort the
governments in having such powerful ships available.

&quot;Get ready, we&#39;re going down to the deck in a few
moments,&quot; the pilot called.

&quot;Great,&quot; Shinji muttered as they dropped,
unconsciously reaching out for the nearest hand. Rei
looked a bit startled as her hand was gently but
firmly clasped and Shinji apologetically said, &quot;I
don&#39;t much like landings.&quot;

A slight smile teased Rei&#39;s lips, &quot;Me, too.&quot;

&#39;Well, isn&#39;t that interesting?&#39; Maya watched the two
of them in surprise as they swooped down to the deck
of the aircraft carrier. After a moment there was a
soft thump, the rumble of the engine&#39;s fading away.

&quot;We&#39;re down,&quot; Misato unstrapped herself from the
copilot&#39;s seat first, exiting into the back cabin
before sliding open the side door.

Maya unclipped herself from the seat and left, then
Rei and Shinji followed her out onto the windswept
deck of the massive aircraft carrier &#39;Over the
Rainbow.&#39;. With a surprised cry Shinji fought to force
her skirt down as the stiff sea breeze tried to whip
it up, well aware of the sailors around them looking
on curiously.

&quot;Knew I should have just worn pants,&quot; Shinji murmured
as they hurried forward to where a group of figures
waited.

&quot;Admiral,&quot; Misato nodded to the older man, a group of
lesser officers lined up behind him, all looking at
the newcomers suspiciously.

&quot;Major,&quot; the Admiral nodded, his gray hair controlled
by his uniform cap. &quot;The papers?&quot; he asked flatly.

From under her red jacket Misato handed over a folder,
which the Admiral flipped open to examine the papers
carefully. &quot;Your orders, sir,&quot; Misato said calmly,
&quot;including my formally taking charge of your cargo.&quot;

&quot;You!&quot; a woman&#39;s voice cut off further conversation.
Above them on the command deck a woman looked down,
her red-orange hair blowing around her face even as
her red dress swirled in the breeze. Boldly she
grabbed the railing and vaulted over, dropping to the
deck beside them with surprising ease.

&quot;Young lady...&quot; the Admiral started scoldingly.

&quot;Asuka!&quot; a slightly scruffy looking man called from
the command deck, his face unshaven if somewhat
handsome.

&quot;Kaji!&quot; Misato blurted.

Asuka Sorryu Langley looked around her with a frown,
&quot;So which one of you is the ace?&quot; Her gaze fell on
Maya, &quot;It&#39;s you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, no,&quot; Maya held up her hands defensively.

&quot;Everyone, I&#39;d like you to meet Asuka Soryu Langley,
the designated pilot of Unit Two and the Second
Child,&quot; Misato said with barely hidden amusement,
&quot;Asuka, you already know Rei Ayanami and this is
Shinji Ikari, pilot of Unit 01.&quot;

&quot;Her!&quot; Asuka blinked, looking at Shinji skeptically,
&quot;She&#39;s the one who successfully defeated a Angel in
her first sortie?&quot;

Shinji gave Asuka a wary look as she said, &quot;It&#39;s nice
to meet you, too.&quot;

&quot;I think we should be talking about this in private?&quot;
Maya jumped in quickly.

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Misato noted sheepishly as she
turned to the mildly bemused Admiral and said, &quot;Sorry,
sir.&quot;

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; the Admiral flicked a glance to
Asuka, &quot;she&#39;s been fairly high strung since she came
aboard.&quot; Clearing his throat he said, &quot;I feel certain
that our other guest can escort you to a room you can
all talk in.&quot;

Kaji waved cheerfully from where the taller man
slouched casually against a railing. &quot;What the hell
are you doing here?&quot; Misato asked crossly as they
walked the halls, the metal floor ringing beneath
their feet.

&quot;Why, I&#39;d think you&#39;re not happy to see me,&quot; Kaji
smirked and Misato just growled.

&quot;Ayanami,&quot; Asuka said flatly to her, the three of them
walking a bit apart from the older pair. She tossed a
measuring glance at Shinji, &quot;And I understand your
father is Commander Ikari? That explains a lot.&quot;

A muscle in Shinji&#39;s jaw tightened as she clenched it,
then said to her grimly, &quot;That has nothing to do with
me being a pilot.&quot;

Asuka looked back at her, faintly surprised at the
tone of Shinji&#39;s voice. &quot;Oh really,&quot; she murmured
thoughtfully.

Jumping into the awkward moment Maya said with forced
cheerfulness to Asuka, &quot;We brought the power cable for
your Evangelion, if there&#39;s an emergency you can
deploy.&quot;

Asuka flipped her hair back, &quot;Of course, I&#39;d be
honored to use my superior skills.&quot;

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Kaji said as they reached a door,
opening it to reveal a long table and chairs scattered
around. In a surprisingly intimate gesture Kaji
slipped his arms around Misato from behind and purred,
&quot;Missed me?&quot;

WHACK! Smoothly Misato struck him upside the head,
sending him jumping backwards as she dryly said, &quot;Not
so much, no.&quot;

&quot;Still with Ritsuko, huh?&quot; Kaji said as they all
grabbed their seats.

&quot;And happily so,&quot; Misato nodded. Oddly as she said it
Maya flinched a bit, looking oddly uncomfortable. Not
noting that reaction Misato gave Kaji a wary look and
asked, &quot;So what are you doing here, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Since I was on an errand to NERV anyway I jumped at
the chance to escort Asuka there,&quot; Kaji said with a
grin.

&quot;Lecher,&quot; Misato muttered.

&quot;Uhm,&quot; Shinji ventured, &quot;have you know each other
long?&quot;

&quot;Since university,&quot; Kaji laughed, &quot;back when she and
Ritsuko first met.&quot; He grinned impishly, &quot;Why, one
time I walked in on Ritsuko and Misato when they
were...&quot;

Swiftly Misato slapped a hand over his mouth, &quot;They do
not need to hear that!&quot;</pre>
