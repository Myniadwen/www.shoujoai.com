<h1>Third Genesis (part 36 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>Ritsuko Akagi frowned as the blonde haired woman typed
away on the computer, a unlit cigarette dangling from
her lips. As the doors to the lab swished open she
didn&#39;t even look at her guest as she calmly said,
&quot;It&#39;s not done yet, Misato.&quot;

&quot;How did you know it was me?&quot; Misato asked her as the
black haired commander of NERV walked in.

&quot;Maya knows not to interrupt me when I&#39;m on a roll,&quot;
Ritsuko shrugged calmly, frowning as she adjusted
something on her screen.

Misato walked to ger side then reached out to tap the
unlit smoke. &quot;Having problems quitting?&quot; she asked.

Ritsuko took it out, looking at it with a wry kind of
amusement. &quot;It helps me think,&quot; she admitted, eyes
never leaving the blueprint she was working on.

&quot;Is that...?&quot; Misato looked down at the quickly
forming design.

&quot;The modified carrier design you asked for,&quot; Ritsuko
nodded. &quot;I&#39;m using a modified long-range transport jet
as the base,&quot; she calmly explained, &quot;then retrofitting
the interior to carry a Evangelion, power system and
cables.&quot;

&quot;Or a Archangel?&quot; Misato mused.

&quot;I can design it to be compatable for both,&quot; Ritsuko
agreed. She looked up at Misato, &quot;Are you considering
using Unit Alpha in field operations?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m debating it,&quot; Misato conceded. She put her hands
in her red jacket&#39;s pockets, her black dress hugging
her form, &quot;The tests so far have been good, and
Asuka&#39;s trip outside yesterday went off without a
hitch.&quot;

&quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean a combat run will go as well,&quot;
Ritsuko put her smoke on the edge of a saucer sitting
on the counter.

&quot;That is the risk,&quot; Misato agreed, &quot;but I want to be
prepared either way.&quot;

Ritsuko nodded, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll keep that in mind in
the design.&quot;

Misato grinned slightly, &quot;So how are things going with
you and Maya? From the occassional noises we hear in
our apartment you two seem pretty happy.&quot;

Ritsuko actually blushed faintly, &quot;We&#39;re doing fine,
thank you.&quot;

&quot;When are you having the wedding?&quot; MIsato asked
curiously.

&quot;Not till this current mess is over,&quot; Ritsuko
admitted. &quot;Besides, we&#39;ll need the extra time to bring
Maya&#39;s poor father around.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s having a hard time accepting the situation?&quot;
Misato asked with a frown.

Ritsuko fiddled with her cigarette, &quot;Thankfully, he&#39;s
coming around. I rather suspect Maya&#39;s mother is
having a influence, but it&#39;ll take time.&quot;

Misato patted her on the shoulder, &quot;Well, if you need
any help, call.&quot; She grinned, &quot;I just hope you don&#39;t
dress us all in hideous bridesmaid dresses.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to find something nice,&quot; Ritsuko chuckled.
She made shooing gestures, &quot;Now I&#39;m sorry, but I need
to get back to work.&quot; She winked, &quot;My boss is a real
hard ass, you know.&quot;

&quot;I resemble that remark,&quot; Misato chuckled, heading out
with a smile.

Striding away, Misato made it a point to stop in on
various offices and workers, nodding in a friendly way
and making conversation. It wasn&#39;t her being snoopy,
exactly, it was more a attempt to stay in the loop
with as many people working at NERV as she could.

&quot;Maya,&quot; Misato nodded to the younger woman who was
supervising the work in the weapons lab. In front of
them, robot construction gear manipulated various
metal and alloys, gradually producing a long, thin
weapon that resembled a sword.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya Ibuki smiled with a openness that still
occasionally surprised Misato, considering the things
the girl had seen working here.

&quot;Is that the progressive sword prototype?&quot; Misato
asked curiously, watching as lasers sliced into steel,
shaping it carefully.

Maya nodded, her grey uniform crisp and neat as usual.
&quot;We&#39;re experimenting with the same sort of metal as
used in the armor on the Evangelion,&quot; she revealed,
&quot;we&#39;re hoping that, combined with a Evangelion&#39;s
strength, will be effective.&quot;

&quot;What about the AT field?&quot; Misato mused.

&quot;As usual, the Evangelion will need to pierce the
field before and conventional weapon can be used,&quot;
Maya admitted. She smiled, &quot;We are experimenting with
a means of channeling a AT field through the blade,
but it&#39;s still in the testing stages.&quot;

&quot;Ritsuko&#39;s well along with the design for the new
carrier unit,&quot; Misato mused, &quot;but it&#39;ll be a week, at
least until it&#39;s built. Keep working on this till
then.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya smiled. &quot;Yui has also been a big
help, both here and working with the Magi,&quot; she noted.

&quot;You&#39;re working all right together?&quot; Misato asked
curiously.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Maya agreed, &quot;she&#39;s quite nice, really.
The only tome she gets cranky at all is when she&#39;d
deprived of her coffee.&quot;

&#39;I can understand that, I get that way without my
beer,&#39; Misato admitted silently. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll let you
get back to it,&quot; she said aloud, turning and heading
out once more.

Outside, in the sunlight Asuka Soryu Langley walked
with confidence, her skirt swirling around her legs as
she and her friends went out to the arcade. &quot;So,&quot; the
redhead asked the others, &quot;Rei and I are on alert till
further notice.&quot;

&quot;Sucks,&quot; Toji offered, the taller young man&#39;s short
black hair swept to the side by the breeze. Other than
his slight limp it was impossible to tell he had once
been a pilot, except for the slightly haunted look
that lingered in his eyes.

&quot;Are they expecting an attack on the city itself?&quot;
Hikari asked them, the brown haired girl frowning
slightly.

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Rei admitted, the dark blue haired
young woman staying close to Asuka&#39;s side. She looked
good dressed in white shirt and a light blue skirt,
her hair slightly ruffled by the breeze.

&quot;Really?&quot; Aida looked a little surprised, the brown
haired boy peering around with his portable film
camera.

&quot;Just because we&#39;re pilots,&quot; Asuka looked amused,
&quot;doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re kept entirely in the loop.&quot;
Silently she mentally added, &#39;Besides, I&#39;m not sure
even Misato knows if they&#39;ll actually attack or not.&#39;

Toji lead the way into the dimly lit arcade nearby
their school, &quot;Well, I figure you&#39;ll be able to handle
it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei smiled.

As Aida took his place in front of his favorite robot
fighting game he dropped a coin in and asked them,
&quot;How&#39;s Shinji doing?&quot;

&quot;Aida,&quot; Hikari scolded him, the brown haired girl
giving Asuka a silent look.

&#39;I&#39;m almost glad I told her the truth,&#39; Asuka
admitted. &quot;He&#39;s probably working a bit too hard,&quot; she
answered mildly, &quot;recovering from his breakdown.&quot;

&quot;I suppose if anyone&#39;s earned the right to have one,&quot;
Toji conceded, &quot;it&#39;s Shinji.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Hikari agreed. She watched Aida
demolishing levels on the game an a impish look
appeared in her eyes, &quot;Asuka, why don&#39;t you try this
in vs mode?&quot;

&quot;You can do that?&quot; Asuka looked amused.

&quot;Me, versus Asuka?&quot; Aida&#39;s eyes lit up, &quot;I&#39;d love
that!&quot;

&quot;Maybe all of Aida&#39;s video gaming and war otaku habits
might actually pay off,&quot; Toji noted wryly.

Rei smiled slightly, &quot;It could be fun.&quot;

&#39;It&#39;s surprising what that smile can make me do,&#39;
Asuka admitted to herself as she sat down across from
Aida and put her own coin in. Within a few moments she
mastered the controls, then went looking for Aida.

&quot;Who do you think&#39;ll win?&quot; Hikari asked Toji softly as
the two opponents stalked each other on the view
screen.

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Toji admitted, &quot;Aida knows the game and it&#39;s
rules, but Asuka&#39;s the one with real battle
experience.&quot;

&quot;There you are,&quot; Asuka murmured as her humanoid
fighting robot stalked through the city streets
hunting her prey.

Suddenly Aida smashed a nearby wall, revealing a
power-up he used to boost the cannon he carried,
firing devastating shots at the stunned Asuka. &quot;Yes!&quot;
he crowed as explosions ringed the pilot and sent her
flying backward.

&quot;Why that little...&quot; Asuka growled as she saw her life
gage drop dangerously. While ploting a Evangelion, she
had been trained to avoid property damage, but
aparently here it gave you an advantage. Seizing the
chance she thrashed buildings with glee, soon finding
both life restorers and other power ups.

&quot;He&#39;s in trouble,&quot; Rei predicted calmly.

What followed was a beat down of legendary
proportions, where Aida had almost no chance to
recover and was chased around the simulated Tokyo
relentlessly. Finally she pinned him, then Asuka
struck, claiming his final life points and defeating
him.

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Toji winced, &quot;nice to see the old vicious
Asuka&#39;s still there.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; Asuka gave him a look.

&quot;Nothing, nothing...&quot; Toji tried to look innocent.</pre>
