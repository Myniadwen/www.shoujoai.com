<h1>Blood Sisters (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/bloodsis-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Ritsuko sat there looking at Misato, oddly feeling like 
she&#39;d been hit in the back of the head with a board. &#39;She knew?&#39; she 
thought weakly, &#39;I&#39;ve been feeling guilty about reading her journal, 
and she knew about it all along?&#39;

        &quot;How did you know?&quot; Ritsuko finally managed to ask, looking 
over at the dark haired young woman standing there beside her.

        &quot;I know I&#39;m a slob,&quot; Misato smiled slightly as she walked 
over to one of the futons, sitting herself down in the middle of 
it, &quot;but I usually know where my stuff is. I could tell it had been 
moved, so...&quot; Misato shrugged slightly.

        Ritsuko walked over to her own futon, sitting down so that 
she was facing the smiling Misato. &#39;Well, at least she&#39;s not upset,&#39; 
she mused. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about reading it,&quot; she smiled slightly, &quot;it 
was open when I picked it up.&quot; Misato&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as 
she looked at her, and Ritsuko felt a sudden flutter of nervousness.

        &quot;And what bit did you read?&quot; Misato asked softly.

        Ritsuko hesitated, trying to read her expression. Finally 
she sighed softly, &quot;I don&#39;t remember it all exactly, but you were 
obviously angry. About people calling you a lush, not understanding 
what you were going through. And....&quot; she trailed off.

        Misato sat there, her eyes dark. &quot;And?&quot;

        Ritsuko continued on reluctantly, &quot;That your job was to send 
the kids out to battle, and to watch them die if you weren&#39;t good 
enough.&quot;

        Misato flopped back on the futon, looking up at the old 
fashioned roof of their room. &quot;You set this trip up so that we could 
talk, didn&#39;t you?&quot; she asked.

        Ritsuko smiled wryly, feeling a bit amused at being so 
transparent to her old friend. &quot;Pretty much,&quot; she conceded. With an 
sinking feeling she realized that she had underestimated her friend 
rather badly, both with the journal and after. &#39;I didn&#39;t even credit 
her with that sort of intelligence,&#39; she admitted to herself.

        Misato turned on the futon, leaning on an elbow. She gave 
Ritsuko a little smile, &quot;Thanks for the thought, but it isn&#39;t really 
necessary.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that,&quot; Ritsuko answered softly. Misato 
looked back at her, the younger woman&#39;s eyes dark, almost entirely 
unreadable.

        &quot;Don&#39;t we need to start getting ready for bed?&quot; Misato 
asked, getting up off of the futon once again. She shrugged off her 
red jacket smoothly, the black top that she usually wore underneath 
clinging to her body.

        With a soft sigh Ritsuko accepted the change in topic. &quot;I&#39;m 
not letting it go that easily,&quot; she warned Misato quietly as she got 
up to walk over to her bags. She rummaged around for her night 
clothes, turning around only to stop cold.

        Misato&#39;s top hit the floor, revealing that she wasn&#39;t 
wearing a bra. Her breasts weren&#39;t overly large, but they were perky 
and with out any signs of sag. Misato noticed her gaze and smiled 
slightly, &quot;They aren&#39;t all that different from when we were 
roommates.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t remember you running around our rooms topless that 
often,&quot; Ritsuko replied.

        Misato slid her black pants to the floor, wiggling her hips 
a bit to get free. Thankfully she was wearing panties, though the 
lacy, delicate underwear weren&#39;t all that much of a 
concealment. &quot;That&#39;s because of all the rumors that were going 
around school that you were bisexual,&quot; Misato said casually as she 
slipped into a nightie, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to take any chances.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Ritsuko blurted, feeling the blood rushing from her 
face.

        &quot;You didn&#39;t know?&quot; Misato looked at her in surprise. She 
smiled slightly, &quot;I thought the rumor would have worked it&#39;s way 
back to you eventually.&quot;

        Ritsuko scowled, &quot;No, I did not know!&quot;

        A blush settled across Ritsuko&#39;s cheeks as the blonde 
remembered the house party that she had attended as a junior. The 
beautiful orange haired senior with the knowing hands had gently 
pulled her into a empty bedroom, laying her out onto the bed. 
Ritsuko sighed softly, &#39;Obviously we didn&#39;t slip away unobserved.&#39;

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Misato said quietly. She looked the 
still fully clothed Ritsuko up and down, &quot;Aren&#39;t you getting ready 
for bed?&quot;

        &quot;Uh, right,&quot; Ritsuko stammered. She pulled her own shirt off 
over her head, then her pants hit the floor. She was just a bit 
surprised to feel Misato&#39;s gaze resting on her, and she took her 
time slipping her pajama top and bottom on.

        &quot;Little old fashioned,&quot; Misato noted with a little smile.

        &quot;They&#39;re comfortable,&quot; Ritsuko shrugged slightly. She walked 
over to her futon, kneeling down there as Misato took a seat 
opposite her.

        &quot;So has Maya seen those yet?&quot; Misato teased her as she lay 
down on her futon, just like they had dome back when they were both 
a lot younger. Ritsuko found herself looking over at her blankly and 
Misato shook her head in exasperation, &quot;She&#39;s got such a crush on 
you, Ritsuko! Haven&#39;t you done anything about it yet?&quot;

        Ritsuko felt her cheeks reddening as she thought, &#39;What 
happened to my plan to grill her?&#39; she wondered as she tried to 
regain some of her tattered composure. &quot;Just because she has a crush 
on me,&quot; Ritsuko tried to maintain her dignity from where she was 
laying there on her back, &quot;doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m interested in her.&quot;

        &quot;Probably too butchy for you,&quot; Misato smirked.

        Ritsuko restrained herself, barely, from giving her first 
answer. &quot;Maya&#39;s cute,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but she&#39;s not my type.&quot; 
Silently she added, &#39;And then there&#39;s Gendo.&#39;

        &quot;And I suppose Gendo wouldn&#39;t much approve,&quot; Misato sighed, 
rolling over on her side to look at Ritsuko impishly.

        Ritsuko nearly sat up in surprise, groaning softly. &quot;I&#39;m not 
even going to ask how you know about that,&quot; she sighed.

        &quot;When you&#39;re having a quickie in a control room,&quot; Misato&#39;s 
smirk was obvious in her voice, &quot;make sure ALL the security cameras 
are off.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, god,&quot; Ritsuko muttered, covering her face with a pillow 
while Misato laughed. The two of them finally settled into bed, 
relaxing as they put the lights out.

        The voice came out of the near darkness as Misato 
asked, &quot;What the hell am I going to do if one of them does die?&quot;

        &#39;At last,&#39; Ritsuko thought with some relief. &quot;You&#39;ll know 
that you did your very best to prepare them,&quot; she answered 
softly, &quot;and that it wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;

        A moment of silence, &quot;Shin-chan nearly went home once, you 
know. If I hadn&#39;t gone to see him off, he probably would have left 
this craziness.&quot;

        &quot;His father would have brought him back,&quot; Ritsuko said it 
firmly before quietly adding, &quot;and with you, he&#39;s happier.&quot;

        &quot;Poor kid,&quot; Misato&#39;s voice was sad.

        &quot;If you weren&#39;t here,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s voice was soft, &quot;he, Asuka 
and Rei wouldn&#39;t have anyone in their corner. There&#39;d just be cold 
scientists like me or bastards like Gendo around.&quot;

        Misato actually sounded a bit surprised, &quot;You&#39;re not that 
bad.&quot;

        Ritsuko smiled slightly, noting Misato hadn&#39;t contradicted 
her about Gendo. &#39;If only you knew,&#39; Ritsuko thought about some of 
the things that were going on at Nerv. &quot;Trust me, I am,&quot; she 
answered Misato firmly. Bringing them back on topic she 
said, &quot;You&#39;ve helped these kids a lot, and not just as their 
commander.&quot;

        There was such a long silence that Ritsuko thought that 
Misato had fallen asleep. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Misato finally said softly.

        Ritsuko smiled, even though she knew her friend probably 
couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she said softly, &quot;now let&#39;s get 
some sleep. We&#39;ve got the hotsprings to do tomorrow.&quot;

        &quot;And tomorrow we get to hear Asuka complain about sharing a 
room with Rei,&quot; Misato added dryly. &quot;I can hardly wait.&quot;

        To shared laughter they lay back down to sleep...
