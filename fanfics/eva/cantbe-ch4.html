<h1>If I Can't Be Yours (part 4 of 16)</h1>

<a href="../eva/cantbe-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Maya? Are you OK?&quot; She looked up with a start, wondering where the 
tears on her hands and face had appeared from. She quickly wiped at her 
eyes.

&quot;Umm.sempai, yes, I, I&#39;m fine.&quot; She smiled, and would have been almost 
convincing were it not for the tearstains on her soft cheeks. Seeing her 
like this again was almost unbearable for Ritsuko. The girl may have 
been suffering but dammit she was brave. Ritsuko found herself once 
again torn between the impulse to hold Maya close to her and tell her 
everything was going to be fine, or-

Ritsuko&#39;s arms were around Maya before she even recalled the second 
option. Maya rose to her feet and snaked her arms around the slim waist 
of her sempai, sobbing into her shoulder. It occurred to her that her 
face was only a few inches away from the ear of her taller superior. It 
occurred to Maya how easy it would be to say three words, right now, one 
of the simplest sentences that existed, if only she were brave enough. 
Maya hated herself at that moment for not having the guts to just say &quot;I 
love you&quot;. The opportunity was theer for her and she ignored it. Maya 
nuzzled a little at Ritsuko&#39;s shoulder and let out another small sob.

&quot;If only I could tell her&quot;

Maya was crying again. Ritsuko reminded herself that she needed to 
remain strong, she couldn&#39;t let go too. She blinked furiously to keep 
herself from crying. She managed to overcome her emotions, at least on 
the surface, something she had become very good at over the years. The 
feeling of Maya&#39;s diminutive frame pressed against her own brought 
another wave of tenderness over the taller woman and she sighed 
blissfully. Human contact. Something she had missed a huge amount in 
recent weeks, contact from another person who she really cared for 
anyway. Maya&#39;s face was all but hidden and she felt the shorter woman&#39;s 
head incline slightly into her shoulder. Could she say it now? She had 
often said it to Gendou without difficulty, why was this situation 
proving so much harder than she could have anticipated? In a way it felt 
almost like taking advantage of Maya. She was emotionally fragile and 
almost certainly impressionable, saying it now would be wrong, not to 
mention completely unfair. Besides which there was a substantial chance 
that her words could be misconstrued anyway, as an expression of 
platonic love, or worse, as the love of a workman for his tools because 
to all intents and purposes, in a professional environment, Maya was 
little more than a tool who facilitated Ritsuko&#39;s own duties. At least, 
that was Gendou&#39;s taken on the technician&#39;s job description.

Ritsuko instead settled for kissing the top of Maya&#39;s head so softly the 
other girl barely noticed. &quot;Shh, it&#39;s okay, everything&#39;s going to be 
alright.&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;If only she knew.&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

They arrived at Nerv headquarters shortly after 9.30, Maya straightaway 
settling into her rapid typing at her console, whilst Ritsuko headed for 
her office and was less than surprised by the usual ream&#39;s worth of 
papers that had accumulated in her inbox. She switched on her computer 
and whilst it was warming up she perused the uppermost file of the stack 
of paperwork. A post-it note was stuck to the front of it that simply 
read &quot;Ring me, please&quot; in the commander&#39;s aggressive hand. Ritsuko 
sighed wearily, she knew full well what that message meant, she was 
beginning to lose track of the number of times it had appeared in with 
her day&#39;s work. Ikari never requested that she called him unless he 
wanted to sweet-talk her into another sexual liason. She knew that she 
would buy whatever he said, when he wanted something he could be 
incredibly charming. She decided to bite the bullet and get the call 
over with. This was the only time she ever used his personal extension 
number.

&quot;Dr Akagi.&quot;

&quot;You requested I ring you, sir.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I did, how are you Ritsuko?&quot; She sighed. He was only ever this 
personal with her when he was attempting to coax her to sleep with him. 
She would fall for it, play along with his false sweetness as she always 
did, but she wasn&#39;t most happy with herself when she did.

&quot;To be honest I&#39;m a little tired this morning, but not much different 
from usual, yourself?&quot;

&quot;The old men of the committee, as you may be aware, are looking to 
advance their schedule by a few days, naturally this displeased me but 
of course we are not going to bow to their demands.&quot; She made a vague 
noise of agreement, and they both paused for a few seconds. &quot;I&#39;d like to 
see you again today.&quot; They both knew it was more of an order than a 
request.

&quot;Certainly Commander, what time would you like me to arrive?&quot;

&quot;1 p.m. would be appropriate, I have no meetings until 3 this 
afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

&quot;I look forward to it.&quot; Then, almost as an afterthought; &quot;Thankyou, 
Ritsuko.&quot;

She placed the phone back onto its cradle with a defeated sigh. There 
was something about his manner in those conversations that made her 
uneasy, how he could be relatively pleasant and humane to her solely to 
manipulate her into doing his bidding. What annoyed her more was that 
she allowed him to get away with it, she was more than willing for him 
to use her as.as what? What did she gain from it other than a few 
moments of physical pleasure? She was little more than Gendou&#39;s whore, 
just as mother had been. This had bothered her before, but not to this 
extent. Absent-mindedly, she lit up a cigarette and began to tap some 
code into her computer as she continued her ruminations. So she slept 
with her commander, surely that wasn&#39;t such a big deal. He gave her some 
validation, some meaning to her life other than her work. Aside from 
anything else, her exchanges with Gendou were much less messy than the 
other relationships she saw going on around her. Misato, running to the 
arms of an old flame in desperation every time she realised just how old 
she was getting and trying to fill her own personal void with sex. 
Shinji&#39;s obvious quasi-oedipal attraction to the first child was simply 
unnatural. She shrugged, it seemed that unconventional relationships 
were very much the norm within Nerv, why should her sexual encounters 
with Ikari be a problem?

Without warning, her thoughts darted back to Maya. This complicated 
matters somewhat. Although she had often pondered upon it before, the 
line of questioning in her head seemed all the more strident in the wake 
of last night. She had known of her feelings for Maya for some months 
now, months in which she had continued her affair with Gendou without 
any notable crisis of conscience but now things seemed suddenly 
different. She realised that she had probably learned more about Maya 
last night than in the whole of the rest of the time she had known her. 
It was as if a barrier between them had been removed, not only 
physically in the entrance of Maya into Ritsuko&#39;s home but also 
emotionally, in Maya&#39;s transition from amicable colleague to friend. 
Maya was no longer simply a pleasant younger woman whom she worked with. 
Quite literally overnight she had become a real, three-dimensional 
person whose existence in Ritsuko&#39;s mind now went far beyond the 
talented Lieutenant she had previously known her as. This had in turn 
affected how Ritsuko felt for the other woman, the affection and desire 
previously felt had increased exponentially when she had invited Maya 
into her home and in effect brought their two worlds together. She no 
longer felt simple adoration and respect tinged with lust; she had now 
fallen completely in love with her. She loved every part of Maya she had 
discovered so far and wanted to learn all there was to know about her, 
from her, to take care of her and be taken care of by her. She had 
barely given a second thought to how significant inviting Maya home 
could have been last night and now she realised. And she knew she could 
never go back.</pre>
