<h1>Third Genesis (part 19 of 39)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/3gen-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>        Asuka turned in front of the mirror, checking if her old school 
uniform fit properly. She looked good, even with her left eye obscured 
by the eyepatch, but felt odd. She was used to the NERV uniform she had 
been wearing, not this.

        &quot;How do I look?&quot; Rei asked her tentatively. Asuka turned, her 
face lighting up in a welcoming smile as she took in the blue haired 
young woman. She blushed, smiling in pleasure in her matching girl&#39;s 
school uniform.

        Asuka grinned, &quot;You look great.&quot;

        Rei looked up at Asuka thoughtfully and said, &quot;You know, I&#39;m 
more used to seeing you in the NERV uniform.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Asuka tugged at her skirt.

        &quot;So why not wear it?&quot; Rei offered.

        &quot;I couldn&#39;t do that...,&quot; Asuka trailed off thoughtfully. She 
smiled slightly, &quot;But there is something I could wear instead.&quot;

        The sound of the suite&#39;s front door opening announced Misato&#39;s 
arrival and a few moments the general of NERV arrived. Her black hair 
fell into her eyes and she looked tired. She looked them over and 
smiled, &quot;You look good.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei beamed.

        &quot;Any chance of a last minute reprieve?&quot; Asuka asked with a 
hopeful smile.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Misato shook her head, &quot;what&#39;s really annoying is that 
the decision to pout you back in school is as much politics as anything 
else.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Asuka raised an eyebrow.

        Surprisingly it was Rei that answered. &quot;Japan was heavily under 
the UN and NERV&#39;s influence,&quot; she noted, &quot;this might be a way of trying 
to exert their control over us.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Misato nodded. They trooped into the living room where 
she flopped down onto a couch. &quot;At least your old uniforms still fit,&quot; 
she offered to Asuka.

        &quot;I&#39;m not planning to wear them, though,&quot; Asuka replied firmly. 
She sat forward in her seat, &quot;Would you mind if I went in a boy&#39;s 
uniform?&quot;

        Rei looked a bit surprised while Misato looked curious. &quot;That&#39;s 
going to get people talking,&quot; Misato finally said.

        &quot;I&#39;m already going to be the topic of gossip,&quot; Asuka waved 
towards her eyepatch, &quot;I might as well be bold about it.&quot;

        &quot;I like the idea,&quot; Rei said softly, &quot;Asuka looks good in pants.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Misato flashed a smile, &quot;but we&#39;ll have to get 
you fitted with a new uniform. Do you want me to...?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll go shopping,&quot; Asuka smiled, &quot;though I could use a ride.&quot;

        &quot;I have just the captain in mind,&quot; Misato smirked. Not long 
after Maya was having the errand explained, the black haired young woman 
smiling wryly. &quot;You mind?&quot; Misato finally asked.

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Maya smiled, &quot;it&#39;ll be just like when I used to 
run the errands for Ritsuko.&quot; She nodded to Asuka, &quot;You want to go now?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Asuka grinned.

        Rei tagged along, leaving Misato alone for a bit. She went next 
door, knocking on the door. Ritsuko answered a few moment&#39;s later, 
peering at her over her glasses. Absolutely unintimidated Misato smiled, 
&quot;Can we talk?&quot;

        Ritsuko lead her inside, revealing a much neater version of the 
sort of suite that Misato and the girl&#39;s shared. It was also the home of 
a pair of technophiles, from an advanced personal computer to one of the 
most sophisticated coffeemakers on the market.

        &quot;You have you command face on,&quot; Ritsuko noted, the blonde 
pouring them each a cup of coffee, &quot;but you&#39;re here in on our off hours, 
so you don&#39;t want this to be official.&quot; She lead her to a seat, &quot;What&#39;s 
up?&quot;

        &quot;It something like that, yeah,&quot; Misato agreed. She took a drink 
of her coffee, savoring the smooth taste, &quot;What&#39;s going on with the 
Magi?&quot;

        Ritsuko&#39;s expression was unreadable, &quot;Nothing.&quot;

        Misato flashed a smile, &quot;That&#39;s exactly what I mean.&quot; They sat 
there silently for a few moments before Misato asked, &quot;What is the 
status of the Magi?&quot;

        Ritsuko took a drink, her own expression thoughtful. &quot;I almost 
wish that I was a beer drinker,&quot; she murmured. She smiled at Misato 
wryly, &quot;Whatever happened in the end effected the three Magi computers 
too, it seems.&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Misato sat up, her expression alarmed.

        &quot;To the best of our technician&#39;s knowledge the Magi are nearly 
catatonic,&quot; Ritsuko reported to her commander coolly. She drank some 
more coffee, &quot;They function as basic computers, but the mind seems to be 
gone.&quot;

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Misato murmured, the oddest look on her face. &quot;You said 
the technicians,&quot; she noted, &quot;you haven&#39;t gone down yourself?&quot;

        &quot;My mother and I didn&#39;t get along very well to start with,&quot; 
Ritsuko said mildly, &quot;and my encounters with her virtual incarnation 
haven&#39;t been much better.&quot;

        &quot;I won&#39;t order you,&quot; Misato said, &quot;but it might be worth a try.&quot;

        Ritsuko met her eyes, then looked down at her coffee. &quot;I&#39;ll 
try,&quot; she finally said.

        Misato decided not to push her any farther, changing the subject 
instead. &quot;So how is living with Maya going?&quot; she asked.

        Ritsuko felt herself blushing slightly. &quot;We&#39;re remarkably 
compatible, it seems,&quot; she smiled. There was a wicked tilt to her grin 
as she added, &quot;And she&#39;s remarkably inventive in bed.&quot;

        Misato nearly choked on her coffee. &quot;I didn&#39;t need to know 
that,&quot; she coughed.

        Ritsuko looked more serious as she asked, &quot;Are you dating at 
all?&quot;

        Misato shook her head, &quot;No, not now anyway.&quot; She smiled 
ruefully, &quot;Kaji wasn&#39;t the most trustworthy man, and I don&#39;t really want 
to....&quot;

        &quot;I understand,&quot; Ritsuko nodded, &quot;as you well know.&quot;

        Misato tilted her head to the side curiously, &quot;Do you ever wish 
that we...?&quot;

        &quot;Occasionally,&quot; Ritsuko admitted. She smiled sadly, &quot;But at the 
time I was still far to blinded by Gendo, there was just no way.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Misato nodded. &quot;And I had a we bit of a panic attack 
right after we got back to NERV that time,&quot; she confessed.

        Ritsuko flashed a smile, &quot;Let me guess. You went out, got 
blasted, and then went out with the first available man to prove you 
were straight.&quot;

        &quot;How did you know?&quot; Misato blinked.

        Ritsuko shrugged, &quot;Because it was what I did the first time I 
slept with a woman.&quot;

        They both shared a quiet laugh, talking softly as they drank 
their coffees. &quot;Rei surprises me occasionally,&quot; Misato noted at one 
point, &quot;we were talking about why we had to send her and Asuka back to 
school and she got it instantly.&quot;

        &quot;Rei isn&#39;t stupid,&quot; Ritsuko agreed, &quot;you&#39;ve got to remember that 
most of her DNA comes from Yui Ikari, and she was a genius.&quot;

        &quot;I forget sometimes. Rei is such an innocent,&quot; Misato mused.

        &quot;And don&#39;t think Rei doesn&#39;t occasionally take full advantage of 
it,&quot; Ritsuko said in a half joking way. She smiled, &quot;Though I noticed 
Asuka doesn&#39;t have that problem.&quot;

        &quot;Rei&#39;s got her wrapped around her finger in other ways,&quot; Misato 
agreed with a laugh.

Author&#39;s Notes: Part of what Ritsuko and Misato is talking about is a 
short fling that the two women once had. That event was chronicled in my 
story &#39;Blood Sisters&#39; and is available on fanfiction.net and other 
fiction sites.</pre>
