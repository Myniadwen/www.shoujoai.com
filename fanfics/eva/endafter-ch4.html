<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, 
resting presented a problem Asuka hadn&#39;t counted on. Her apartment was 
a single bedroom affair and she had no sofa. She&#39;d never really expected 
guests, so she didn&#39;t even have spare bedding. When this was pointed 
out, the response she received was typical Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
can sleep on the floor.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;No 
you bloody can&#39;t,&quot; said Asuka, &quot;you&#39;ll freeze to death with 
only those clothes to keep you warm!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
she probably wasn&#39;t exaggerating all that much. Winter hadn&#39;t quite 
crept up on Kaibyaku, but it was unseasonably cold for the time of year 
and the apartment&#39;s heating system wasn&#39;t all that reliable. Asuka chewed 
on her lip as she looked around for a solution.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fine,&quot; 

she said, at last, &quot;It&#39;ll be a bit cramped, but we can both sleep 
in my bed for tonight.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked a little concerned by this.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;ve 
only ever slept alone before,&quot; she said.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;ll 
be fine,&quot; assured Asuka, &quot;as long as you don&#39;t kick me out 
of bed. We&#39;re both girls after all.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
still looked worried, but she nodded anyway.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pyjamas 
were the next order of the day. Asuka rummaged through her drawers again 
and then handed Rei her spare set. They were a cool blue colour that 
matched Ayanami&#39;s hair, while the pair Asuka wore were pale pink. Then 
they each sat on opposite sides of the bed while they changed.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;No 
peeking,&quot; growled Asuka as they did so, and she smiled to herself 
a little. When she had changed, she jumped under the covers to get away 
from the chill air that was getting colder by the minute. The heating 
still hadn&#39;t come on, and perhaps wouldn&#39;t now. Still, there was nothing 
to be done about it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
turned off the light and got into the bed much more carefully than Asuka 
had. Then they both lay on their backs, side by side, their shoulders 
touching. For a while the quiet was a little uncomfortable as Asuka 
stared up at the ceiling, tired and yet wide awake. She glanced across 
at Rei and saw she was doing the same.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hey,&quot; 
she said, returning her eyes to the ceiling, &quot;talk to me?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;About 
what, Asuka?&quot; asked Rei.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Tell 
me how Shinji is doing,&quot; said Asuka, &quot;where is he? What is 
he doing?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;He 
seems to be doing much the same as you are. He has a small house, he 
does jobs, he helps people. Major Katsuragi lives nearby. She helps 
him.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
looked at her again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;She 
loves him, doesn&#39;t she?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Rei, &quot;if you think she does, then 
probably.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
do,&quot; said Asuka, then after a pause: &quot;You have feelings for 
him as well, don&#39;t you.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked at her, mildly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of 
course,&quot; she said, &quot;we are biologically related, after all.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh!&quot; 

exclaimed Asuka, &quot;Well, yes, I&#39;d forgotten about that...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
have feelings for Shinji too, I think,&quot; said Rei, taking her by 
surprise. Then the surprise subsided and Asuka sighed. It wasn&#39;t that 
much of a revelation anyway, even if Rei was the one saying it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
did,&quot; she replied, &quot;I made a mess of it though... we both 
did. Now, I don&#39;t know...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They 
stared into each others eyes for a little while, not needing to speak, 
feeling almost as though their minds were touching in the dark.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei,&quot; 
said Asuka after a while, turning her body towards Rei, &quot;your eyes 
are amazing.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
blue haired girl looked away.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
never liked my eyes... I always hated the colour red.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But 
I wore red all the time...&quot; said Asuka, then her eyes widened. 

&quot;Oh...&quot; she finished, lamely.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It 
wasn&#39;t because of you,&quot; said Rei. &quot;Red was a bad colour. It 
was the colour of the tank in which I was grown. It was the colour of 
the dying sun. It was the colour of blood...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It 
still is as far as I&#39;m aware,&quot; said Asuka, then immediately regretted 
it. To her own ears, she sounded as if she was mocking Rei&#39;s pain. To 
try to cover this up, she went on. &quot;Hey, do you still hate red?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
turned her head towards Asuka, looking at her with wide eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t know,&quot; she said, &quot;I think, partly, it was because I 
hated myself.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
think we all did that,&quot; replied Asuka, then her eyes widened again, 
&quot;hated ourselves I mean, not...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked at her as she trailed off and Asuka saw nothing in her face that 
suggested she had offended her. Asuka felt relieved. Probably it would 
be impossible to hurt Rei with words, even if they were intended maliciously. 
She sighed again and closed her eyes.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Gaah, 
I think everyone at Nerv was screwed up â€“ me especially. It was a 
screwed up place at a screwed up time.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
felt Rei shift next to her then there was silence and stillness, save 
for the motions of their breathing.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Perhaps 
she wants to go to sleep</i>, thought Asuka and decided to keep her 
eyes closed in case slumber would come to her also. In fact, she was 
just drifting when she felt a light touch on her cheek, as fingertips 
brushed her skin.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Her 
eyes snapped open and she saw Rei watching her intently. Her hand withdrew 
as they stared at one another. Asuka was suddenly wide awake once again, 
her heart beating significantly faster than it had been moments before.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
are you doing?&quot; asked the young German, breaking the silence between 
them.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
looked peaceful,&quot; said Rei, her expression and tone neutral.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of 
course I did, I was almost asleep!&quot; replied Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;ve 
never seen someone sleep peacefully before. I wonder, do I look the 
same when I sleep?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Okay, 
okay, she was just investigating, that&#39;s all</i>, thought Asuka, <i>

nothing to worry about</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
why should she be worried? She&#39;d already said that they were both girls, 
what could possibly happen? She tried not to think about how flushed 
she had suddenly become.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;H-How 
should I know?&quot; she replied, &quot;I&#39;ve never slept with you before, 
you could kick and scream for all I know!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
now she was trying not to think of the words &#39;slept with you&#39; in such 
close proximity to the word &#39;scream&#39;.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This 
is stupid!</i> she thought, <i>She&#39;s a girl, you&#39;re a girl, neither 
of you swing that way</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, 
maybe, but even if that was true of herself, how could she be sure of 
Rei? Wait, no, the Rei she had known wouldn&#39;t ever think about those 
kinds of things, surely? Besides, she probably didn&#39;t even <i>know</i> 
about those kinds of things. Sheltered was an understatement when applied 
to the former pilot of Eva Unit 00. But then â€“</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Stop 
thinking about it!</i> her mind screamed, <i>Or you&#39;ll never be able 
to sleep!</i></font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perhaps 
you could tell me sometime,&quot; said Rei. And with that, she closed 
her own eyes and settled against her pillow.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yeah...&quot; 
said Asuka, in an uncertain voice, staring at Rei a little warily. She 
found herself still watching Rei rather too many moments later and forcibly 
shut her eyes.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka?&quot; 
said Rei, making her eyes snap open again. The girl next to her still 
had hers closed, however.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes...?&quot; 
Asuka replied slowly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
have soft skin,&quot; said Rei in a faint voice.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</i> 

said her mind, helpfully.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But 
then she found that she was smiling, in spite of herself. Smiling at 
the way she was behaving.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I 
really am stupid</i>, she thought, <i>Rei is Rei, and I am me</i>. <i>
Something like that could never happen</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
with that, she closed her eyes one final time.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Goodnight 
Rei,&quot; she murmured, as sleep stole over her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No 
answer came.</font> <br> <br></p>
