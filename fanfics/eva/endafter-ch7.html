<h1>The End and After - New Beginnings (part 7 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../eva/index.html">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mel.html">Mel</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../eva/endafter-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They 
cleaned the apartment thoroughly, vacuuming floors, dusting surfaces. 
Asuka scrubbed the bath and beat the floor mats out on her modest balcony, 
while Rei scoured the kitchen of any grease and grime that had accumulated 
since Asuka had last performed that chore (which, she was ashamed to 
recall, wasn&#39;t since she had moved in). Rei had no real experience of 
proper cleaning, Asuka had been to her apartment at Nerv and been appalled 
at a) how dirty it was, and b) how messy Rei could let it get without 
actually having any possessions to cause the clutter. So the young German 
gave her careful instructions about what she was supposed to be doing, 
then left her cleaning the kitchen sink. After an hour, she decided 
to check on Rei&#39;s progress and was more than a little concerned to find 
an absolutely spotless (and veritably glowing) sink, but no other work 
done. When she&#39;d entered the room, Rei had looked up from polishing 
the already gleaming taps, with a look almost of hope in her eyes, as 
if she desperately wanted to be praised for doing a good job.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
had bitten her tongue (with just a <i>little</i> difficulty) and patiently 
explained that Rei should be a little less thorough and a little more 
speedy at getting through the various jobs. After all, she reasoned 
to herself, Rei had never had to clean before. Gendo had obviously never 
thought it necessary to stress the importance of housework towards his 
young creations, and Rei had been absent from school so often that classroom 
cleaning hadn&#39;t ever been an issue for her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This 
is all new to her</i>, thought Asuka, <i>she&#39;s learning as she goes 
along, so getting angry with her wouldn&#39;t be productive in the 
slightest</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, 
Rei seemed to be a fast learner. When she checked again half an hour 
later, the blue haired girl was buried in a cupboard with a duster and 
some polish and had almost finished with the kitchen. And what was more, 
she seemed to have done a fairly decent job of it.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They 
carried on cleaning the rest of the apartment, Rei dusting light fixtures, 
Asuka carrying out the rubbish, Rei cleaning the kotatsu, Asuka rearranging 
the furniture. At last, at half past six, Asuka flopped back on a chair 
and swiped her brow with the back of her hand. Rei stood before her, 
clutching a rag in her hands and looking awkward.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Good 
job, today,&quot; Asuka told her, &quot;you really got into the swing 
of things!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
looked mightily relieved.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thankyou 
Asuka,&quot; she replied and smiled tentatively.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Right,&quot; 
said Asuka standing up again, &quot;I&#39;ll let you have a bath first.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rei 
nodded.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;But 
don&#39;t be taking too long, Maya will be here soon, and I don&#39;t want to 
greet her looking like this!&quot; She indicated her grimy face. Then 
she giggled. &quot;You look like you&#39;ve crawled through a dust making 
factory!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
was right, Rei had smudges of dust all over her cheeks and forehead 
and the clothes she had been given the day before were covered also.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
dirty too...&quot; Rei pointed out to Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
guess you&#39;re right,&quot; replied the German, looking at her grubby 
hands and smiling. &quot;I didn&#39;t realise how dirty I&#39;d let this place 
get.&quot; She sighed happily, feeling cleansed after the work they&#39;d 
done, even though she was so filthy. &quot;Right, you,&quot; she said 
spinning a startled Rei around. &quot;Bath!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While 
Rei occupied the bathroom, Asuka searched for fresh clothes for her 
new companion (washing her hands first, of course). She left them outside 
the bathroom door for Rei to find when she exited, then went and flopped 
back down in the living room, to wait her turn. They had flung open 
all the windows and the air that wafted through the house felt fresh 
and wonderful to breathe in deeply, quite soon Asuka fell into a happy 
doze.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When 
she opened her eyes again, Rei stood over her, holding the fresh clothes 
to her stomach. Other than that, she was completely naked. Her blue 
hair hung in damp strands around her shoulders as she leaned forward 
slightly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka?&quot; 
she said quietly, &quot;I&#39;ve finished in the bath.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
groaned.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
going to have to stop walking around my home naked, you know, Ayanami?&quot; 

she muttered.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Five 
minutes later she was in her own bath, soaking luxuriously. It was unfortunate 
that she had so little time, she could have easily stayed in the bath 
a good hour or so, but as ten-to-seven arrived she reluctantly got out 
and began towelling herself dry. She did so quickly, wanting to be ready 
before Maya arrived at seven, swiftly moving from her body to her long 
red hair.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As 
the towel buffeted the sides of her head, she failed to hear a knock 
at her front door. When she straightened and checked how she looked 
in the mirror, she did hear Rei pad past the bathroom door, but thought 
nothing of it. She had just begun attacking her hair again with the 
towel, when an ear-splitting scream made her freeze.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Oh 
my god!</i> she thought, <i>She&#39;s seen her already!</i></font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
wrapped the towel around her quickly and dashed out of the bathroom. 
This wasn&#39;t how she had planned it. Asuka had wanted time to prepare 
Maya for the return of the first child, to talk to her calmly on her 
doorstep before reintroducing the pair in her living room. Heck, it 
would still have been a shock, but it would surely have been better 
than this was undoubtedly going to be...</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
scene that greeted her in her entrance hall was like a tableau from 
a waxwork museum. Rei stood in the middle of the hall, having retreated 
several steps from the doorway in shock at Maya&#39;s reaction to her. Her 
eyes were wide and her hands were bunched in the front of the dark blue 
T-shirt that Asuka had given to her to wear.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Well, 
what did you expect?</i> Asuka found herself thinking, in exasperation 
of the blue haired girl.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
still stood, frozen, outside the open door. Two bags of groceries lay 
at her feet where she had dropped them, a single tomato had escaped 
and was rolling across Asuka&#39;s doorstep. Maya&#39;s hands were held to her 
mouth, only partially obscuring the look of terror on her features, 
eyes so wide Asuka thought they might drop out of her head. </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
former lieutenant drew a breath, ready to scream again, but Asuka rushed 
past Rei and clapped her hand over Maya&#39;s mouth before she could.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s 
okay!&quot; she cried, &quot;Maya, it&#39;s okay, she&#39;s not here to hurt 
you!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
shook her head violently from side to side, mumbling into the German&#39;s 
hand. Tears were starting in her eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei!&quot; 
said Asuka, sharply, drawing the frightened girl&#39;s attention, &quot;Could 
you go into the living room and wait for us there, please?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
blue haired girl nodded and retreated swiftly. Her disappearance did 
little to ease Maya, however. She turned her terrified gaze on Asuka, 
tears beginning to roll down her cheeks.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka...&quot; 
she breathed.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;m 
not going to hurt you, either. You&#39;re safe Maya, nothing bad is going 
to happen.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
collapsed against her, sobbing into her shoulder. Asuka put her arms 
around her friend and stroked her hair as she wept.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By 
now other people from her apartment block were appearing on the entrance 
gangway, attracted by the scream, each of them looking worried at the 
weeping woman that Asuka held. Even one or two people in the street 
below had stopped what they were doing and were craning their heads 
towards the pair.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s 
okay, she&#39;s just had some bad news,&quot; Asuka told them, &quot;it&#39;s, 
er, a family member, you know?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
pulled Maya into her apartment and closed the door, breathing a sigh 
of relief. Then she sat them both down on the step and held her at arms 
length. The tears did not lessen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You&#39;re 
going to have to get hold of yourself now, Maya,&quot; she said sternly, 

&quot;I know you&#39;ve had a shock, and I&#39;d hoped you wouldn&#39;t have to, 
but weeping like this is not on.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
former lieutenant looked at her with tear-stained, and still slightly 
shocked, eyes. Asuka wasn&#39;t sure quite how compos mentis she was, but 
she didn&#39;t look like she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown any 
more, so that was a small positive. Ibuki drew a shuddering breath.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;R-Rei...&quot; 
she began, &quot;I saw Ayanami-san...&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
know,&quot; replied Asuka, &quot;now don&#39;t go off on one, but... she&#39;s 
here. She&#39;s back.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
drew another frightened breath.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;She&#39;s... 
here?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes,&quot; 
replied Asuka, nodding, &quot;she&#39;s not here to do any harm, she&#39;s not 
here to hurt anybody, May–&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh 
my god – Fourth Impact!&quot; whispered Maya.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;NO!&quot; 
said Asuka, forcefully. Maya looked momentarily taken aback. &quot;No,&quot; 
repeated Asuka, more gently this time, &quot;I don&#39;t think she could 
do that, even if she wanted to. She&#39;s just a girl now, Maya. She&#39;s just 
Rei.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
looked at her ex-colleague and her previously wild eyes gained some 
focus. Then she looked down.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Asuka... 
did you really go outside dressed like that...?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
young German looked down at the towel that was still wrapped around 
her, barely covering her various charms.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With 
the howl she let out, it was a wonder her neighbours didn&#39;t batter her 
apartment door down to save the inhabitants from being murdered.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Twenty 
minutes later (and having apologised profusely to her neighbours for 
the disturbance) a fully clothed, under control Asuka sat uncomfortably 
at her kotatsu. Rei sat at her left and Maya at her right, and while 
the former lieutenant couldn&#39;t seem to take her wide and wary eyes off 
the fourteen year old in front of her, Rei didn&#39;t seem to be able to 
look up from the hands that were clasped in her lap.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;So, 
that&#39;s how it is,&quot; Asuka was saying, her eyes darting from one 
girl to the other, &quot;I&#39;ve decided to have Rei stay here until she 
can get on her feet and fend for herself. We&#39;re intending to look for 
work for her in the next few days. I was hoping you could help with 
that, Maya. Maybe check to see whether anything is going at your 
company...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
glanced back to Maya, who neither indicated that she had heard nor, 
in fact, moved in any way.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Maya...?&quot; 
said Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mmmm? 
What?&quot; replied her friend, more than a little – well, no, really <i>
very – </i>distractedly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;What 
do you think?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;About 
what?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;About 
everything,&quot; sighed Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;So... 
she&#39;s not here to remake the world?&quot; asked Maya, tearing her eyes 
away from Rei&#39;s down-turned face, at last. Asuka sighed again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;We&#39;ve 
been through all that...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, 
if she&#39;s not here to start Fourth Impact, or to get revenge on all of 
us, then what is she here for?&quot; said Maya, almost angrily.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why 
don&#39;t you ask Rei that,&quot; replied Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
supposed that her friend&#39;s reaction was not at all unexpected, or even 
unjustified, but the way Maya was acting still riled Asuka, somewhat.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Can&#39;t 
she see that Rei is no danger to her, or anyone else?</i> she thought 
to herself, <i>She hasn&#39;t made one threatening gesture since she 
arrived!</i></font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Of 
course it was going to take a lot more than that to convince her, Asuka 
knew that. Maya had been through a lot, just as she had. It would be 
only natural for her to focus her feelings of anger and loss upon Rei, 
but Asuka also knew such vitriol would be unfair if vented upon the 
blue haired girl. Rei didn&#39;t pull the trigger that killed Ritsuko and 
she wasn&#39;t solely responsible for the remaking of the world. She might 
have formed the bridge between this world and the LCL, but even that 
wouldn&#39;t have happened without manipulation from Gendo and complicity 
from Shinji. Rei alone could never have caused Third Impact. Asuka had 
long since come to the conclusion that they were all responsible, Maya 
included. After all, her work could have done nothing but hasten Gendo&#39;s 
twisted plans and therefore the arrival of the subsequent terrifying 
events.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still, 
try telling that to someone who&#39;s lost the only person they ever loved 
because of those events.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;She 
killed doctor Ritsuko,&quot; said Maya, her pretty features beginning 
to twist of their own accord into an expression of intense dislike.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;No 
she did not!&quot; cried Asuka, angrily, &quot;Gendo did that, and you 
know it!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
gritted her teeth and looked away. Asuka could see the beginnings of 
tears glistening in her eyes, but at least the hateful look had gone.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
was not a real person,&quot; said Rei, startling Asuka and causing Maya 
to look back, eyes sparkling. The blue haired girl was staring at the 
surface of the kotatsu. &quot;I was a fake soul born into an artificial 
body. One of many and none of them.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rei...&quot; 
began Asuka.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
was created solely for Commander Ikari&#39;s plans; to bring back his dead 
wife.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You 
think that excuses what you did? All the people you killed?&quot; shot 
Maya, bitterly.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Maya!&quot; 
warned Asuka again.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;The 
ones that were taken by third impact are not dead, they are in the sea 
of souls. The ones that are not came back.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not 
all! Not all came back! Doctor Ritsuko didn&#39;t come back, did she? She 
wasn&#39;t in the LCL and she didn&#39;t come back!&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
am sorry for the ones that died, but I am not responsible for that,&quot; 
said Rei, suddenly looking directly at Maya. Her gaze caught the former 
Lieutenant like a trap. &quot;If you wish to hate me even so, you can.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
took Maya by surprise.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Hate</i> 
you?&quot; she flustered, &quot;It&#39;s not a matter of <i>hate</i>... 
I&#39;m just saying... you don&#39;t understand...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
decided to step in.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“She 
doesn&#39;t hate you, Rei, but you have to understand what you represent 
to her. She associates you with the loss of the person she loved.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
opened her mouth in astonishment, but before she could speak, Asuka 
had turned to her.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I 
know it still hurts, Maya, and I know you&#39;ve had a shock, but I won&#39;t 
let you attack Rei because of that. We&#39;re every bit as much to blame 
as she is for Ritsuko&#39;s death.”</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
closed her mouth again. In her eyes, Asuka saw the hurt her last comment 
had caused.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I&#39;m 
sorry,” she muttered, “but it&#39;s the truth.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
gritted her teeth and looked away, but then nodded.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So 
will you help us?” asked Asuka. Maya turned and looked at her directly. 
Her eyes were hard.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Even 
if I did, do you seriously expect to be able to take her out in public?” 
she asked, “If you think my reaction has been bad, it&#39;ll be ten times 
worse for her when there&#39;s lots of people around. They all know who 
she is, Asuka, just like they all know you and they all know me!”</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
groaned internally. How other people would react wasn&#39;t something she&#39;d 
even considered. Maya was right, the collective terror of the patrons 
at the café yesterday was enough to prove that. People were still people, 
after all.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Worst 
case scenario,” continued Maya, “she&#39;ll get lynched. Brave new era 
or not.” She banged the flat of her hand on the table, leaning forward. 
“And you and me would be nowhere <i>near</i> enough to protect her 
from that.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You 
would protect me?” asked Rei, a look of curious surprise filtering 
through the girl&#39;s usual blank expression. Maya was taken unawares and 
disarmed by the question.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well... 
I... I wouldn&#39;t just stand by... it&#39;s not like I&#39;d want you to get 
hurt...”</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
trailed off, looking frustrated. And, despite the gravity of the topic, 
Asuka found herself smothering a smile at the nature of the former lieutenant. 
She was still basically a good person, despite the horrors she had endured.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
reached out a hand, placing it over Maya&#39;s on the table top.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thankyou,” 
she said.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya 
sniffed, avoiding their eyes, but she didn&#39;t take her hand away.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I 
don&#39;t like violence,” she stated quietly.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I 
know,” smiled Asuka.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Their 
grumbling stomachs soon put paid to any more talk and Maya retreated 
to the kitchen with her groceries to cook them some food, leaving Asuka 
and Rei alone at the Kotatsu. They sat in an uncomfortable silence (at 
least it felt uncomfortable to Asuka; Rei, as always, seemed unconcerned 
by the lack of conversation) until Maya returned with three steaming 
bowls full to the brim with delicious looking Ramen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Good 
job I took you at your word when you said bring lots,” Maya stated 
as she set the tray she was carrying down and handed a bowl each to 
the two girls.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
sat in front of her own bowl, but rather than picking up her chopsticks, 
she placed her hands flat on the table on either side of her bowl and 
stared at it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I 
have one question,” she stated. “And before you protest, Asuka –“ 
for Asuka had indeed opened her mouth in preparation for a defensive 
rebuke “– I&#39;m not going to ask why you&#39;re helping her, or how you 
know she&#39;s not lying, or even what you hope to achieve by taking her 
in.” She held up a hand, as angry words bubbled up in Asuka&#39;s throat. 
“I&#39;m <i>not</i> asking you that, Asuka. But I do want to know, why 
did she come to you?”</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She 
looked at Rei. A hard, direct look that brooked no evasion. Evasion 
was not on the blue haired girl&#39;s mind, however. She stared right back 
at Maya with her deep red eyes, not a trace of emotion showing on her 
face.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I 
came to Asuka,” she replied, “because she is special to me.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Asuka 
could feel the flush creeping on to her astonished face. She struggled 
to come up with a reply that didn&#39;t misinterpret the former eva pilot&#39;s 
words – </font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>It </i>
was<i> a misinterpretation, wasn&#39;t it? To take it </i>

that<i> way?</i> </font></p>
<p align="justify">            <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">– or a reply to make 
light of them, 
or simply any kind of response at all. Unbelievably, her mouth could 
only work silently, not a sensible word coming out of it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Maya, 
on the other hand, seemed satisfied. She nodded, curtly, and picked 
up her chopsticks. A moment later, she was attacking her Ramen with 
a will. Rei, for her part, looked down at her food, her face unreadable. 
Asuka couldn&#39;t think what to say.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Eat 
up,” said Maya, making Asuka jump, “before it gets cold.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And 
although she didn&#39;t look up from her food, Asuka thought she saw just 
the hint of a smile and an odd twinkle in Maya&#39;s eye.</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
food finished, Asuka, made them all coffee (Rei&#39;s black with one sugar, 
Asuka&#39;s black with two and Maya&#39;s white without). The mood had eased 
considerably, and a small amount of conversation was managed. No further 
mention was made of Rei&#39;s situation, or of third impact, or of any of 
the hurtful events in their shared past. Eventually, Maya took the dishes 
out to the kitchen to wash, leaving Rei and Asuka alone at the Kotatsu. 
Before another uncomfortable silence could mount, Rei spoke up.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Asuka...?”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
young German looked at her friend.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What 
Maya said...” she stopped, then started again. “What you said...”</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Rei 
–“ began Asuka, but the blue haired girl shook her head, stopping 
further words. She looked distressed, conflicted.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No 
matter what you say, Asuka... Third Impact couldn&#39;t have happened without 
me... why do you... why did you agree to help me?”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Because 
you asked,” replied Asuka, simply.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They 
lapsed into a far more comfortable silence, Asuka sipping at her coffee, 
Rei simply staring at the surface of the Kotatsu. The German studied 
her friend as she drank. Was it her imagination, or was there a look 
of... <i>contentment</i> on Rei&#39;s face.</font></p>

<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Before 
she could decide for sure, Maya&#39;s voice floated in from the kitchen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Asuka? 
Is this a new sink?”</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
redhead choked on her coffee.</font></p>
