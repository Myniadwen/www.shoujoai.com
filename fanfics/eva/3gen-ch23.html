<a href="../eva/3gen-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>&quot;She did what?&quot; Misato blurted, the black haired woman
looking over at Ritsuko in surprise. They carried the
takeout bags from the door to the kitchen table, Pen
Pen looking up at them eagerly, so Misato casually
slipped the penguin a treat before he bolted. Her
black shirt and matching pants suited her, especially
with her red jacket on.

&quot;Shh!&quot; Ritsuko scolded, the blonde scientist putting a
hand on Misato&#39;s arm. &quot;Maya proposed to me earlier
this evening,&quot; she said, holding up a hand where the
engagement ring gleamed on her finger, &quot;but don&#39;t tell
the others, yet.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Misato raised her eyebrows.

&quot;For one,&quot; Ritsuko made a face as she stopped them,
her dress swirling around her legs, &quot;we&#39;re going to
have to gently break this to Maya&#39;s parents.&quot;

Misato snickered softly, the two standing there in the
hallway. &quot;You mean her parents don&#39;t know about you,&quot;
she asked, &quot;or do they not know she&#39;s gay?&quot;

&quot;Both,&quot; Ritsuko sighed.

&quot;You may want to keep this quiet,&quot; Misato said as they
started out again, &quot;but Asuka and Rei are going to
notice that ring.&quot;

Back in the kitchen Asuka calmly took a garbage bad
and swept all the garbage off the table, Rei following
to pick up the beer cans for recycling. &quot;You two do
this often?&quot; Maya asked, watching the two and
sweatdropping slightly.

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; a smiling Asuka agreed, the orange
haired girl&#39;s right eye twinkling merrily. Combined
with her eyepatch it gave her a oddly rebellious look,
almost like some troublesome pirate right out of an
old movie.

&quot;Misato is getting better about cleaning up,&quot; Rei
offered mildly, the simple sundress that she wore
hugging her slim body. She went over to the sink and
wrung out a washcloth then wiped down the dining table
smoothly.

&quot;True,&quot; Asuka agreed, giving Rei a fond look as she
added, &quot;who knows, maybe we&#39;ll have her well
trained... in a few years.&quot;

Maya smiled slightly, watching them standing so close
together. &quot;So how has it been, going back to school?&quot;
she asked the two of them curiously, Maya still
dressed in her NERV uniform pants and a white button
up shirt.

&quot;A little odd,&quot; Asuka acknowledged, getting some juice
from the fridge. &quot;Most of the others are still the
same, but I&#39;m different,&quot; she shrugged.

There was a ghost of a smile on Rei&#39;s lips as she
quietly added, &quot;And I think they have no idea what to
make of me.&quot;

Maya had to admit it, but Rei was right. The
differences between the previous incarnations of Rei
and the current one were extreme, and not just in the
personality. Fully healthy and vibrant. Rei&#39;s body
didn&#39;t look as undernourished and delicate as it once
had. Along with that she smiled more, a gentleness in
her voice and manner so different from the remote
qualities she had once had.

Ritsuko and Misato walked down the hallway into the
brightly lit kitchen, the two of them talking away
cheerfully. &quot;Thanks for clearing off the table,&quot;
Misato said, carrying the cartons over and sitting
them down on the table.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rei smiled. She took a deep breath
as the cartons were opened, sighing happily, &quot;Oh, that
smells good.&quot;

Misato set the containers down in the middle of the
table then she handed out chopsticks and paper plates
for them all. &quot;You really don&#39;t like having to do
dishes, do you?&quot; Maya offered shyly, crisply snapping
apart her chopsticks.

Ritsuko snickered softly as she poured juice into her
cup, &quot;You have no idea.&quot;

Asuka blinked, seeing the gold ring with a classy
diamond on Ritsuko&#39;s finger. &quot;What&#39;s with the ring?&quot;
she asked curiously.

Both Maya and Ritsuko went red while Misato laughed
suddenly. &quot;Told you she&#39;d spot it,&quot; Misato said
cheerfully.

&quot;It&#39;s an engagement ring,&quot; Ritsuko said, trying to end
the conversation right there.

Asuka broke into a grin as she looked over at Maya and
exclaimed, &quot;You popped the question? Good for you!&quot;

Maya was blushing fiercely even as Rei mildly asked,
&quot;What does engagement mean?&quot;

&quot;Ritsuko and Maya are going to have a public
ceremony,&quot; Misato said as she loaded up her plate, &quot;to
declare their bonds of love and pledge to stay
together.&quot;

&quot;That was a very poetic description,&quot; Asuka looked
over at Misato in surprise.

Ritsuko and the others followed Misato&#39;s lead to fill
their own plates. &quot;Considering there was a time Misato
and I were going to weddings every few months,&quot;
Ritsuko remarked, &quot;I guess she&#39;s had a lot of time to
think about it.&quot;

Misato sighed dramatically as she lamented, &quot;I can&#39;t
believe my lesbian best friend is actually getting
married before me.&quot;

&quot;Which reminds me,&quot; Ritsuko said conversationally,
&quot;We&#39;re going to need a best man and some bridesmaids.&quot;
She looked around the table pointedly, &quot;Any
volunteers?&quot;

&quot;Sempai,&quot; Maya scolded then she looked over at the
others apologetically, &quot;Don&#39;t let her pressure you
into anything.&quot;

Misato smiled as she took a drink of her juice, &quot;Well,
I&#39;m in.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to help,&quot; Asuka agreed while Rei also nodded
curiously.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ritsuko said, smiling around the table. She
puffed out a breath, &quot;You know, if a few months ago
someone had told me that I was getting married, I&#39;d
have laughed.&quot;

Maya reached out to put her hand on Ritsuko&#39;s, &quot;Then
I&#39;m glad that things have changed so much, my love.&quot;

Misato smiled as she watched Asuka and Rei talking
together softly, Asuka quietly filling in Rei on some
of the details of weddings. &quot;I hate to bring up
business,&quot; she slurped up some noodles, &quot;but what&#39;s
the status on the Archangel?&quot;

&quot;Ninety percent complete,&quot; Ritsuko answered her
crisply, &quot;though the software side may take us a bit
longer to finish.&quot;

Before Misato could ask Maya cut in, &quot;Ritsuko and the
Magi are the primary programmers for the software, I&#39;m
being kept occupied supervising the construction
teams.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Misato nodded.

Asuka looked curiously over at Ritsuko as she asked
her, &quot;So what&#39;s it like, working so closely with the
Magi?&quot;

&quot;It feels very odd,&quot; Ritsuko admitted as she ate, &quot;she
reminds me so much of my mother at times, but so
different, too.&quot;

Misato nodded gravely as she mused, &quot;I don&#39;t know how
I&#39;d feel, having my father reappear in some other
form.&quot;

&quot;At least Magi seems to be satisfied that I&#39;m all
right for Ritsuko,&quot; Maya offered cheerfully. An odd
look suddenly appeared on her face as she asked, &quot;Are
you going to tell Magi about us being engaged,
sempai?&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ritsuko blinked as the others chuckled.

The hospital room was quiet the next day as the
morning sunlight streamed inside, curtains blowing
inward from a cooling breeze. The room was almost
entirely white, with only a few bits of color
scattered about on cards, in the fresh flowers and a
few other items. The bed itself looked quite
comfortable, the figure on it laying flat on his back
as various pieces of medical equipment beeped softly,
monitoring his condition.

Shinji Ikari lay under the white sheets, his brown
hair grown out a bit from the months that he had lain
there asleep. His expression was oddly peaceful, the
lines of strain that had been developing on his face
erased by the balm of sleep. He was healthy, nutrients
coming in via his IV drip, his breath coming nice and
regular but other than that he showed no signs of
life.

Then, there was the slightest sign of movement.
Beneath an eyelid the eye moved, just slightly, and
after a few moments Shinji opened up his eyes. After
gazing at the ceiling hesitantly he pushed himself up,
arms weakened by how long he had lain there, then
rubbed at his eyes.

&quot;Where am I...?&quot; Shinji rasped out, his voice rough
from lack of sleep. He looked around the white room,
frowning in thought, then looked down at himself at
first sleepily, then with growing alarm. &quot;Oh my
GOD....&quot;
