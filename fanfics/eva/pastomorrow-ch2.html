<a href="../eva/pastomorrow-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ritsuko Akagi gasped as a gentle hand caressed her
tear streaked cheek, then she was drawn into a warm
embrace. &quot;Cry,&quot; Misato Katsuragi said softly as she
let Ritsuko&#39;s head rest on her shoulder, &quot;you&#39;ll feel
better.&quot;

Ritsuko&#39;s chest heaved with exertion and pain as
bitter tears streaked her face, the raw emotion too
great to resist. &#39;Mother doesn&#39;t care,&#39; the blonde
young woman thought harshly, &#39;I&#39;m a tool to her,
nothing more.&#39;

Gently Misato patted her friend&#39;s back and shoulder,
murmuring soft comforting words to her as they stood
together in a empty office not far from the test
center, the room only dimly lit by a overhead lamp.
Even as Misato held her she had to concentrate on not
noticing how good Ritsuko felt to hold, or how tight
the plugsuit was on Ritsuko...

&#39;Think about math tables,&#39; Misato mused, &#39;or where you
stashed Ritsuko&#39;s clothes after she changed. Just try
not to think about it...&#39;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ritsuko finally sighed, the smaller black
haired girl looking up at her greatfuly as she pulled
back a little.

&quot;After what we overheard, I can&#39;t blame you for being
upset,&quot; Misato answered seriously, her own slightly
longer black hair flowing over her shoulders. As usual
she wore a red jacket that once belonged to her
father, with a simple black dress underneath.

Ritsuko nodded, &quot;Not just upset, I&#39;m... furious.&quot;

Misato nodded as she heard her phone chirp. &quot;Do you
want me to...?&quot; she asked Ritsuko. A grim smile, &quot;It&#39;s
probably Yui or your mother.&quot;

Ritsuko smiled grimly, &quot;You&#39;d better answer it, we
can&#39;t hide very long.&quot;

Misato took out her phone and flipped it open, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Yui Ikari felt a burst of relief as Misato answered.
&#39;Not that I expected them to disappear, but...&#39; she
mused. Aloud she asked, &quot;Are you all right? Is Ritsuko
with you?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Misato answered shortly. She hesitated a
moment then had to ask her, &quot;Is Naoko there?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m back in my office and Naoko is off seeing a
nurse,&quot; Yui sighed. &quot;Could you two please come up
here?&quot;

Misato relayed the question to Ritsuko. &quot;Sure,&quot;
Ritsuko sighed, &quot;as long as you don&#39;t ask me to
forgive my mother.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Yui sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;

&quot;Wonder why your mother needed to see a nurse?&quot; Misato
wondered as they went out into the hall and took a
wary look around.

&quot;Hopefully she lost a tooth,&quot; Ritsuko muttered as they
hurried to the elevator, Misato fighting back a soft
chuckle. She looked up at Misato, &quot;Could you take me
to where we stashed my clothes?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Misato agreed.

A few minutes later and Yui heard a knock on her door.
&quot;Come in,&quot; she called, the brown haired woman looking
up from her paperwork.

Both Misato abd Ritsuko entered, both ladies dressed
in regular clothes. &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Misato said a bit
needlessly.

&quot;Dr. Ikari,&quot; Ritsuko stepped forward bravely as she
told her, &quot;I am resigning as a possible Evangelion
pilot.&quot;

Yui set the uniform down on her desk with a sigh.
&quot;Your mother didn&#39;t mean what she said, I think,&quot; Yui
said tiredly, &quot;I&#39;m concerned you&#39;re overreacting a
bit...&quot;

Misato snorted softly in disbelief. &quot;Yui, you really
don&#39;t bullshit well,&quot; she noted bluntly, shaking her
head.

&quot;Misato,&quot; Yui gave her a mildly pained look, &quot;you&#39;re
not helping.&quot;

Misato walked a bit closer, meeting her eyes as she
asked, &quot;Yui, can you really look me in the eye and
tell me Naoko didn&#39;t mean it?&quot;

For a moment Yui looked up to meet the eyes of a girl
she considered a daughter, then had to look away.
&quot;No,&quot; she conceded, &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Your loyalty to my mother does you credit,&quot; Ritsuko
sighed, &quot;but it&#39;s not needed. I&#39;ve always known mother
didn&#39;t like me.&quot;

Without really thinking about it Misato went over to
Ritsuko&#39;s side and slid a arm over her shoulders.
&quot;Yui,&quot; she said as she held Ritsuko gently, &quot;what do
we do know?&quot;

Yui Ikari sat back a moment then quietly asked,
&quot;Ritsuko, I doubt you want to stay with your mother?&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Ritsuko agreed.

Yui smiled slightly, &quot;Then I think we&#39;ll lend you a
room for a bit.&quot; She rubbed at her eyes, &quot;Then we&#39;ll
go over our potential pilot lists...&quot;

Ritsuko suddenly clutched Misato&#39;s hand as she said,
&quot;Not Misato!&quot;

With that Yui chuckled humorlessly. &quot;Trust me,&quot; she
answered wryly, &quot;I have no intention of making that
mistake.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato blushed as she felt Ritsuko&#39;s fingers
entwined with hers. Quietly she asked, &quot;Mom, can you
delay Naoko so we can grab Ritsuko some clothes from
home?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not home to me,&quot; Ritsuko muttered.

&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can,&quot; Yui promised, &quot;but you should
get going soon.&quot; Inder her breath she murmured, &quot;Maybe
I can distract her with the latest Magi updates...&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato called as they hurried off.

Slipping out of GEHIRN was easy, and Misato soon
comandeared a unmarked van, taking the wheel with
confidence. &quot;Are you sure you can drive this?&quot; Ritsuko
wondered as she put on her seat belt.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Misato said as she put it in reverse and
thumped them hard against the wall the bumper was
right up against.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ritsuko hid a smile.

Misato blushed so cutely that Ritsuko had to fight
back a laugh. &quot;Oops,&quot; she admitted as she put the van
into gear and got them moving.

Feeling oddly like a battered wife Ritsuko hurried
into the apartment she shared with her mother. It was
almost eerily clean, like a show home not a place
where people lived out their lives. With a almost
savage pleasure Ritsuko yanked clothes from the
drawers of her dresser, enjoying seeing the normally
tidy room made messy.

Carrying a old backpack full of clothes Ritsuko
hurried out into the hall and announced, &quot;I&#39;m ready to
go.&quot;

Misato nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s get going, I don&#39;t want to see
Naoko&#39;s reaction.&quot;

Squealing out of the building&#39;s parking lot both girls
sounded off with relieved sighs, even more so when
they saw Naoko&#39;s familiar car park not far from where
they had been. Being careful not to draw attention
Misato drove them over to Yui&#39;s house as she quietly
explained the living conditions.

&quot;I&#39;m willing to take the couch,&quot; Ritsuko offered as
Misato slid open the traditional sliding doors of
Yui&#39;s ancestral home.

Misato laughed, &quot;We have a spare futon.&quot; She hesitated
a moment, &quot;There&#39;s plenty of space in my room, if
you&#39;d like.&quot;

A faint blushed colored Ritsuko&#39;s cheeks as she
gruffly answered, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

Misato&#39;s room, unlike the lived in neatness of the
rest of the house, was a pigsty. &quot;Sorry about this,&quot;
Misato said as she scooped up empty food containers
into a black plastic bag.

&quot;God you&#39;re a slob,&quot; Ritsuko chuckled good naturedly
as she helped tidy, &quot;what are you going to do if you
ever move out on your own?&quot;

&quot;Find a wife to take care of me,&quot; Misato shot back
teasingly.

Ritsuko snickered, &quot;I wish her luck.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; Misato protested, &quot;and what do you
mean, her?&quot;

Ritsuko flushed slightly, &quot;Hey, you said wife.&quot;

&quot;Okay, true,&quot; Misato conceded. She smiled slightly,
&quot;And to be honest, it&#39;d probably have to be a woman or
saint to put up with me.&quot;

&quot;You certainly aren&#39;t the saint type,&quot; Ritsuko started
to joke, then sniffled suddenly. It had been a long
few hours, and she was only keeping it at bay with
nervous energy.

&quot;Ritsuko,&quot; Misato stopped her picking up garbage and
looked her in the eye. &quot;It&#39;ll be all right,&quot; she said
softly.

Ritsuko sighed softly, &quot;I don&#39;t see how.&quot; She took a
ragged breath, &quot;I finally know how much I mean to my
mother... no more than a computer.&quot;

&quot;Maybe yes, maybe no,&quot; Misato said gently, &quot;but you
mean a lot more than that to me, Yui and all your
friends.&quot;

Ritsuko managed a smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</pre>
