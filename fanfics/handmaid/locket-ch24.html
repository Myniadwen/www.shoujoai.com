Ami had to fight the urge to smile at the clearly bewildered looking 
young man. Inviting him to attend the meeting was reasonable, what 
they were discussing certainly involved him, too. But the look on his 
face was priceless!

&quot;You&#39;re all gay?&quot; Mamoru echoed, his eyes wide.

&quot;Lesbians,&quot; a smiling Usagi corrected him gently. She laughed, 
grabbing his arm, &quot;And I&#39;m still in love with my Momo-chan!&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;re not too sure about Hotaru and Chibi-Usa,&quot; Minako 
thoughtfully pointed out. The two girls in question were playing 
outside together, pointedly ignoring them.

Mamoru visibly sweatdropped. &quot;And you&#39;ve all been taking Usagi out to 
a lesbian bar?&quot; he asked them all.

&quot;We&#39;ve been keeping an eye on her,&quot; Makoto reassured him with a smile.

Rei came in to the room, smoothly sliding the door shut behind her. 
&quot;So did you break the news to him?&quot; she asked as she settled down to 
sit beside Ami. She smiled happily as Ami gently slid her arm around 
her shoulders.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami smiled at her. She chuckled softly, &quot;Once the shock wears 
off, I think he should be OK.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mamoru appologized sheepishly, &quot;it&#39;s all just kind of sudden, 
for me. I just get back from the states, Usagi tells me there&#39;s a 
meeting, and then...&quot; He shrugged.

A soft knock on the door, and Rei called out, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Setsuna lead the way, Haruka and Michiru right behind her. &quot;I&#39;m still 
not sure this is a good idea,&quot; Setsuna was saying over her shoulder to 
Haruka.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; Haruka smiled, &quot;to decide that.&quot; 
She gave the inners a wave, sitting down by Usagi and getting a most 
unfriendly glance for Mamoru.

Usagi, of course, didn&#39;t notice a thing. &quot;So why did you call a 
meeting?&quot; she directed the question to the Outers cheerfully.

&quot;Haruka wants to tell Arisugawa Juri about all of us being Senshi,&quot; 
Michiru said to them conversationally.

&quot;If she doesn&#39;t already know by now,&quot; Haruka noted, picking up some of 
the snacks Makoto had made and popping them into her mouth.

Mamoru was opening and closing his mouth, silently. Finally, he 
recovered enough to ask, &quot;She might already know?&quot;

&quot;She knows about the Outers already,&quot; Setsuna admitted. &quot;She had 
deduced Haruka and Michiru&#39;s identities, and I transformed in front of 
her,&quot; she said.

Even Ami seemed a bit startled, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;

&quot;To confirm if is she is immortal,&quot; Setsuna answered calmly, drinking 
her cup of tea. &quot;She is,&quot; she added quietly.

Another long silence as they all digested that.

&quot;That explains something,&quot; Rei said quietly, &quot;I had a vision, in front 
of the sacred fire not long ago. I saw all of us in Crystal Tokyo, and 
a group of seven men and women nearby.&quot; Her eyes widened, &quot;One of them 
did look like Juri!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to know we&#39;ll have some company in Crystal Tokyo,&quot; Makoto 
said softly. There was a general round of thoughtful nods.

&quot;For me, there&#39;s only one question to ask,&quot; Mamoru said. He looked 
around the group, finally settling on Usagi as he asked, &quot;Do you trust 
her?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Haruka said without hesitation. The others all spoke up their 
agreement, Usagi finishing with a cheery, &quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;I guess it is that simple,&quot; Setsuna agreed with a little smile.



Juri pulled up to the shrine, looking at the steps with a grim 
expression. &quot;Haruka, this had better not be a joke,&quot; she muttered as 
she began the long climb. Not too long later she reached the top, and 
had to smile as she looked around.

&#39;It&#39;s like an oasis, this green place hidden in the middle of the 
city,&#39; Juri thought. Hotaru looked up to see her and smiled before 
whispering something to a pink hared girl standing beside her. She 
took a few steps forward and noticed a short, bald man sweeping around 
the shrine. &quot;Hello,&quot; she smiled at him.

Grandpa looked up at her and smiled, &quot;You&#39;re Juri, right?&quot;

She blinked, looking a bit surprised, &quot;Ah, yes. You were expecting 
me?&quot;

He smiled, &quot;Rei described you pretty well. Just head on over and 
knock,&quot; he waved at the building, &quot;I&#39;m sure one of them will let you 
in.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; and Juri bowed respectfully. She waved to Hotaru, who 
grabbed her friend&#39;s hand and dragged her on over.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Hotaru smiled, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Chibi-Usa.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Juri said, quite seriously offering the girl her 
hand. Just looking at her, Juri rather suspected most people didn&#39;t 
take the pink hared little girl very seriously, so she decided to try 
and do so.

Chibi-Usa obviously appreciated it, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;The others are waiting inside,&quot; Hotaru smiled, and led Juri over to 
the building.

The door slid open, and Juri felt a bit of flutter of nervousness. 
Areound the table was a small mob of Haruka and Michiru&#39;s friends, 
many of the young ladies having become regulars over at the Locket.

Ami sat with her girlfriend Rei, snuggling together, while Minako and 
Makoto were without their girlfriends, Usagi sat with a handsome young 
man she didn&#39;t recognize, Haruka and Michiru sat close together, there 
was Setsuna, and Chibi-Usa and Hotaru settled in to sit beside Usagi 
and Setsuna, repectively.

Juri smiled at the young man and extended her hand, &quot;I don&#39;t believe 
we&#39;ve met?&quot;

&quot;Mamoru,&quot; he smiled, shaking it firmly.

Looking into his eyes, Juri felt herself relax just a bit. Mamoru&#39;s 
dark eyes seemed to be open and frank, his face quite pleasant. All of 
which didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t really an ass underneath, but it certainly 
helped.

&quot;So what was so urgent that I needed to climb all those steps?&quot; Juri 
asked Haruka with a dangerous smile.

Haruka grinned, &quot;I&#39;m sure the exercise did you good.&quot;

&quot;Grab a seat, Juri,&quot; Ami smiled up at her.

Michiru shifted a bit, and there was a space between her and Setsuna. 
Juri stepped over, sliding down with a smile to Setsuna, &quot;Excuse me.&quot; 
She fought back a blush, as her leg brushed against Setsuna&#39;s.

&quot;That&#39;s quite all right,&quot; Setsuna murmured, her voice a soft purr that 
almost made Juri want to get back up again.

&quot;Would you like a snack?&quot; Makoto offered, passing a tray of cookies 
over.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri sampled a few, and someone poured some tea for her. 
She sipped before asking again, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Everybody looked at Haruka, who rolled her eyes. Taking a breath she 
said simply, &quot;Juri, almost everyone in this room is Sailor Senshi.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Juri answered, eating a cookie.

Another long moment of silence. Setsuna hid a smile, drinking more of 
her tea.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei managed.

&quot;Sailor Mars,&quot; Juri pointed at her, &quot;Sailor Mercury,&quot; at Ami, &quot;Sailor 
Jupiter,&quot; at Makoto, &quot;Sailor Venus,&quot; at Minako, and finally &quot;Sailor 
Moon,&quot; at Usagi. A sip of tea, &quot;I&#39;d guess that Chibi-Usa is 
Chibi-Moon, and Hotaru is Sailor Saturn.&quot; She looked over at Mamoru, 
and a bit more tentatively asked, &quot;Tuxedo Kamen?&quot;

Mamoru nodded, smiling. He shook his head, &quot;All right, I&#39;m impressed.&quot;

&quot;How long have you known?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;I already knew Haruka and you were Uranus and Neptune,&quot; Juri 
shrugged, &quot;it wasn&#39;t that hard to guess that you&#39;re friends were 
probably the other Senshi.&quot;

&quot;And to think I was worried about it,&quot; Ami laughed. She looked at Juri 
thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;re taking this very well, too.&quot;

&quot;I run the &#39;Locket,&quot; Juri smiled at them engagingly, &quot;so wierd is just 
part of the job description.&quot;

General laughter, and the conversation began to flow again. Juri 
leaned back, and tried not to notice the way Setsuna was smiling so 
mysteriously...

Out Cast This Episode: Arisugawa Juri is from Revolutionary Girl Utena 
(and if you don&#39;t know that yet...), and Ami, Chibi-Usa, Haruka, 
Hotaru, Makoto, Michiru, Minako, Rei, Setsuna and Usagi are all from 
Sailor Moon.
