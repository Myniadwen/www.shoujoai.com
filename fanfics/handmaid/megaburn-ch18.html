Sailor Moon shone beautifully as she struck with her
scepter, the weapon unleashing a wave of destructive
energy that cut boomers down by the dozen. But still
the creatures shambled forward, the old subway access
burning behind them as the Sailor Senshi fought.

&quot;Are you sure, Ami?&quot; Sailor Jupiter asked, lighting
blazing as she destroyed another boomer in a splash of
while fluid.

&quot;This is one of the few places that we can access the
old NERV facilities beneath the city,&quot; Sailor Mercury
confirmed, &quot;we need to hold it until the others
arrive.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure the others are coming?&quot; Sailor Uranus
asked, the sandy brown haired woman&#39;s sword cutting a
boomer down easily.

&quot;They are,&quot; Sailor Pluto confirmed, black hair flowing
around her as she used Dead Scream to blast boomers
away from a fleeing mercenary.

&quot;Watch your back, Sailor Moon,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen leapt,
the black haired man&#39;s cane splattering a boomer
easily.

&quot;I knew you were there,&quot; Sailor Moon smiled at him
warmly.

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Sailor Neptune warned, her green hair
shimmering in the firelight.

Four figures emerged from the smoke and flames,
advancing on the Sailor&#39;s position. Mackie Stingray
lead the way, AD Police officer Lisa Valante at his
side. Beside them Mahoro and Minagi were still arguing
with Mackie.

&quot;I thought you were supposed to get to the Locket,
damn it,&quot; Minagi said, her light blue hair flowing in
the breeze.

&quot;No time,&quot; Mackie said, &quot;especially once I saw what
was going on here.&quot;

&quot;Nene&#39;s going to be pissed,&quot; Mahoro predicted glumly.

&quot;It&#39;s been awhile,&quot; Sailor Venus nodded her greetings
as she smiled at the newcomers grimly, &quot;you figured it
out, too?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re going after NERV and the geofront,&quot; Lisa
Valente said, the dusky skinned blonde looking in awe
of the assembled heroes.

Sailor Saturn sliced a boomer into two with a single
swing as the raven haired girl said, &quot;This must be
where most of the Boomers were going.&quot;
&quot;Can you hold them off while we go after Nergal and
who ever else is down there?&quot; Mackie asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sailor Moon nodded confidently.

&quot;We can&#39;t let them go down there alone,&quot; Sailor Mars
pointed out, her gloves nearly as black with soot as
her hair.

&quot;I&#39;m going with them,&quot; Sailor Venus said, her blonde
hair shining like gold.

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Sailor Mercury admitted as she pulled
out her mini-computer. She tapped a few keys,
frowning, &quot;I think you should be able to access the
geofront from here, and there&#39;s a light rail system
connecting to the command center.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s power down there?&quot; Mahoro asked skeptically,
her black hair shiny and clean.

&quot;I suspect our hacker friend can fix that once you&#39;re
down there,&quot; Sailor Pluto said. She gave Mackie a long
look, &quot;Be careful down there.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Mackie said as the five figures moved
forward, picking through the rubble to reach the
underground access.

&quot;You know something, don&#39;t you?&quot; Sailor Uranus asked
Pluto as another wave of misshapen boomers advanced.

The subway below was dark as they advanced, only dim
emergency lights guiding them forward. Mackie walked
up to what looked like a bare wall and slid his hand
along it thoughtfully, expression intent.

&quot;I wonder how much of a lead Nergal and friends have?&quot;
Mohoro murmured.

&quot;Enough that I don&#39;t want it getting any larger,&quot;
Minagi smiled grimly.

&quot;Here,&quot; Mackie announced as a section of wall moved
aside to reveal a large, armored door. &quot;It&#39;s
technically a emergency exit, but it&#39;ll do,&quot; he said
as he pulled out a old key card.

&quot;Where did you get THAT?&quot; Lisa blinked as Mackie
swiped the card, the door sliding open with a groan.

&quot;It belonged to my father,&quot; Mackie said in a flat tone
of voice, clearly NOT wanting to talk about it.

Sailor Venus cupped her hands and concentrated, a
golden light shining forth to cut into the darkness of
the passage. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said and the group moved
on. The air was musty, old, and the dust caught at
their throats as they walked, the small passage
opening up into a mirror image of the subway station,
but much more advanced.

&quot;Emergency power&#39;s still going?&quot; Minagi sounded
surprised.

&quot;Someone else probably started it up when they broke
in elsewhere,&quot; Mackie said as they rushed to the train
cars. Going in he make his way to the front and popped
a access patch off while digging a took kit out of his
jacket&#39;s pocket.

In a few moments Lisa and Mackie got the train going
and with a lurch they were off, the tunnel opening
into a massive underground cavern. The wreckage of a
abandoned past the geofront stretched out around them
abandoned facilities looking as advanced as the modern
city far above them.

&quot;I always wondered why Quincy and the older Genom
corp. never went after this,&quot; Mahoro murmured.

&quot;I suspect he tried,&quot; Lisa looked over at Mackie,
&quot;only to get his hand slapped by the Knight Sabers.&quot;

&quot;No comment,&quot; Mackie smiled mysteriously.

&quot;Is that it?&quot; Minagi pointed to a pyramid like
structure growing larger ahead of them, one of the
only with lights on.

&quot;According to descriptions I&#39;ve heard, yes,&quot; Mackie
confirmed as a spark of light suddenly soared up from
the building towards them.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Minagi yanked Mackie and Lisa back even as the
front of the train exploded under weapons fire. The
power suit swept in, expecting to follow up on it&#39;s
surprise attack but it underestimated it&#39;s foe.

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam Smash!&quot; Sailor Venus cried, her
laser like beam slashing out to send him reeling
backwards.

Pistol in hand Mahoro sighted and fired, two shots
cutting through power connections and crippling the
military suit in a second. &quot;Grab him,&quot; she yelled as
the suit dropped.

&quot;Venus love me chain!&quot; Venus made a tossing motion,
the golden chain wrapping around the armor&#39;s middle as
she grabbed the wall to brace herself. &quot;Ooof!&quot; she
gasped as the full weight nearly dragged her off her
feet, &quot;A little help, please?&quot;

Minagi and Mahoro rushed to help and in a few seconds
they had the crippled armor up on the train with them.
&quot;Notice the logo,&quot; Minagi pointed at the stylized
leaf, &quot;that&#39;s Nergal corporate issue.&quot;

&quot;Oh good,&quot;Lisa smiled.

With a single smooth motion Mahoro grabbed the face
plate and tore, yanking it off with a groan of
protesting metal. The man beneath gazed at them in
shock, his round glasses gleaming. &quot;What... how did
you?!&quot; he stammered.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Venus asked flatly, &quot;and what is Nergal
doing here?&quot;

&quot;My friends want answers,&quot; Mackie said as he squatted
down by where he lay on the ground, &quot;and they&#39;re going
to get them.&quot;</pre>
