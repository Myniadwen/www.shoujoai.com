<a href="../handmaid/locket-ch64.html">Back to Part 64</a><pre>&quot;So why are you so worried about your Grandmother?&quot;
Ryouko asked, light blue hair flowing over her
shoulders as they helped with closing.

Ayeka wiped off the top of a table while Ryouko
stacked up the chairs with ease, &quot;The Devil Princess
of Jurai holds much the same position in our family as
Washu does to you.&quot; As Ryouko visibly paled Ayeka
nodded grimly, her dark purple hair swinging against
her back, &quot;Not even the Emperor defies her.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ryouko murmured, sneaking a glance at Tennyo
Masaki waiting nearby. The white haired youngish
looking woman was dressed in a simple kimono, her eyes
twinkling with a gentle kind of amusement. &quot;So what do
you think Grandma wants?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ayeka shook her head, &quot;but she is
known for matchmaking,&quot;

Ryouko&#39;s eyes narrowed in anger, &quot;I don&#39;t care who she
is, if she tries taking you away from me she&#39;ll see a
fight.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s see what she wants before we panic,&quot; Ayeka said
softly.

&quot;Have a nice day,&quot; Alpha helped usher the last
customers out, then turned to give a weary smile to
Hitomi. &quot;Is it always like this?&quot;

&quot;On some nights we&#39;re actually busy,&quot; Hitomi said
deadpan, the brown haired girl checking the coat check
for anything left behind.

&quot;What?&quot; Alpha blurted, the green haired girl looking
at Hitomi in alarm.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me straight lines like that,&quot; Hitomi
chuckled. She stretched, &quot;Holidays are always a bit
more busy, usually you&#39;ll have an easier night.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Alpha smiled, walking with her over to
the bar.

May was helping count the till with Nabiki, the taller
brown haired woman frowning in concentration. &quot;Alpha,&quot;
May looked up, the bosomy android smiling, &quot;how was
your first full day?&quot;

&quot;Exciting,&quot; Alpha admitted, her simple skirt flowing
around her legs. Having decided her traveling clothes
were a bit too worn the staff had gotten together a
uniform for her, a simple black skirt and blouse with
a white maid&#39;s apron.

&quot;Juri mentioned that we&#39;ve got a upstairs room you can
use,&quot; May produced a key from her usual maid&#39;s
uniform.

&quot;But I can&#39;t...,&quot; Alpha tried to refuse the key.

May took her hand and gently pressed the key into her
grip. &quot;Juri wants to do this,&quot; she reassured her,
&quot;you&#39;re not imposing.&quot;

Alpha gave in as gracefully as possible, &quot;Thank you,
May-sama.&quot;

Keiko chuckled softly as she smoothly reached around
May to hug her from behind. The boyish woman&#39;s short
black hair was tied back, her smile warm as she said,
&quot;It&#39;s nice to see someone appreciates May they way
they should.&quot;

&quot;Keiko,&quot; May scolded gently, but she was smiling
happily.

&quot;They&#39;re adorable, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Minagi chuckled.

&quot;Yes, they are,&quot; Alpha agreed cheerfully. The green
haired girl look at Minagi curiously, &quot;You and your
sister are twins?&quot;

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Minagi answered, her facial scars bending
cutely. &quot;I&#39;m her half-clone, more or less,&quot; she
explained cheerfully.

Alpha blinked, &quot;Long story, I guess?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Minagi agreed. She smiled as a
young woman emerged from the kitchen, her bluish hair
bouncing, &quot;Sasami, have you met Alpha yet?&quot;

&quot;We had one of those hurried introductions when she
was back in the kitchen picking up an order,&quot; Sasami
chuckled.

&quot;I was a little surprised seeing a young girl in the
kitchen,&quot; Alpha admitted, &quot;until someone explained how
old you actually are.&quot;

Minagi laughed as she hugged Sasami, &quot;Yeah, her
appearance can be deceiving.&quot;

Sasami closed her eyes a moment, her form gently
shifting them Alpha&#39;s eyes widened as she became a
full grown adult. &quot;Is this better?&quot; Tsunami asked
curiously.

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Alpha sweatdropped. She softly
murmured to herself, &quot;I see this job is going to take
some getting used to.&quot;

Standing over to the side Tennyo smiled warmly as
Ayeka and Ryouko walked over to her, bowing slightly
to them in greeting and said, &quot;Aunt Ayeka, I&#39;m sorry
if my presence rushed you in any way.&quot;

&quot;Aunt?&quot; Ryouko smirked.

&quot;Let it go,&quot; Ayeka said firmly.

&quot;Sasami looks well, I see,&quot; Tennyo added
conversationally.

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Ayeka murmured distractedly. She
looked at Tennyo piercingly, &quot;So what message does my
Grandmother bring me?&quot;

Quickly Ryouko spoke up, &quot;And if she tries breaking us
up, I&#39;ll...&quot;

Tennyo held up a hand, her smile gentle. &quot;It&#39;s all
right, Lady Ryouko,&quot; she said, &quot;Grandmother merely
sends her greetings to you.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; Ayeka asked suspiciously.

Tennyo lead them towards the door, moving with a
simple sort of grace. &quot;Grandmother is well aware that
your many adventures have kept you two very busy,&quot; she
said, &quot;but there is a urgent manner she feels needs to
be dealt with.&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot; Ryouko blinked, casually nodding
farewell to Juri and the others as they left the bar
together.

&quot;Grandmother told me that she would like you two to
formally announce your engagement,&quot; Tennyo said
simply.

There was a moment of dead silence as Ayeka and Ryouko
processed that statement then both blurted out,
&quot;What!&quot;

Tennyo had a faintly amused look as they left the area
around the Locket and fell into step walking down the
street. Oddly they drew few curious glances, people in
the area having gotten used to the slightly strange
people in the club.

&quot;It is not fitting that a princess of Jurai is living
with another woman,&quot; Tennyo said to them casually,
&quot;without at least the promise of marriage.&quot;

&quot;And if we choose not to get engaged?&quot; Ayeka asked
faintly.

&quot;Then Grandmother would have to consider you available
for matchmaking purposes,&quot; Tennyo replied evenly.

&quot;No way in hell,&quot; Ryouko blurted.

Tennyo looked at Ryouko with a gentle kind of
amusement. &quot;Grandmother isn&#39;t unsympathetic to you,&quot;
she explained, &quot;in her youth she too was fond of the
fairer sex.&quot; Her gaze hardened, &quot;But she also must be
concerned with propriety.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Ayeka started to say only to have Ryouko put a
gentle hand on her arm.

&quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for awhile,&quot; Ryouko
admitted as she knelt down in front of Ayeka, &quot;but
Tennyo&#39;s forced my hand.&quot; Drawing something from herb
pocket Ryouko held out a ornate, Juraian style ring,
&quot;Ayeka Masaki of Jurai, will you marry me?&quot;

Ayeka looked at the ring, then met Ryouko&#39;s golden
eyes filled with nervousness and a bit of fear. &quot;Yes,&quot;
She managed, tears in her eyes as Ryouko slipped the
ring on.

Discretely Tennyo drew out a camera and clicked a few
photos, feeling sympathetic tears in her own eyes.
&#39;They&#39;ll be happy I took these,&#39; she thought, putting
the camera away. Watching as Ryouko pulled Ayeka in a
hug she thought, &#39;I think I may stay on Earth for
awhile...&#39;
