<h1>Unrequited</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../handmaid/index.html">Hand Maid May</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Katsumi lay awake, alternating staring up at the ceiling and looking 
over at her bedside clock. Finally, she sat up in her bed, careful not 
to awaken the little girl sleeping peacefully beside her. She got up 
and quietly paced a bit, restlessly, as she waited for the dawn and 
the time to be right. Finally, she sat down at the nearby desk and 
flipped open her diary.

Katsumi&#39;s pen flew across the pages as she wrote, a hurried but neat 
attempt to try to get her rushing thoughts down on the paper there in 
front of her. She let her thoughts flow free, unrestrained into the 
pages of her diary, a place no one else would ever read them.

Katsumi didn&#39;t know when it had actually started. No, that was a lie, 
she knew exactly when it began: seeing May&#39;s pretty white panties, red 
dress and her pleasant if slightly surprised voice answer Katsumi&#39;s 
&quot;Yo.&quot; She had sat there across from them and just stared at May 
dumbfounded, then she quickly retreated back to her own rooms to 
think.

Life had been very simple for her up to then, going about her day to 
day life, then dressing up sexy to tease the nice but shy science 
student next door. It was a game they both understood, she thought, 
and both of them appreciated. But this feeling she had, it was 
different and she didn&#39;t know what to think about it, or what she 
should do about it.

A few more visits and she still wasn&#39;t sure, but she knew she wanted 
to do something nice for May. Katsumi hadn&#39;t sewed for years, and her 
bandaged fingers certainly regretted it in the morning. It was all 
worth it, though, when that pretty face lit up at the clothes, and she 
saw May&#39;s simple pleasure in trying them on. May had changed right 
there in front of Katsumi, and she had to catch her breath at the 
sight. She was so perfect, Katsumi had thought dazedly.

Rena&#39;s arrival into the situation had complicated things, but it also 
gave her a perfect excuse to go over more often, to spend time with 
May whenever she wanted to. Then Kei came, the tall, pretty girl who 
just moved right in to Kazuya&#39;s life. Kazuya&#39;s, and May&#39;s.

Watching Kei across the way, talking with May and Kazuya, Katsumi had 
felt her own heart drop. It was jealousy she was feeling, she 
realized, it was the very first time she had felt it, and it left a 
bitter taste in her mouth. Katsumi felt so relieved later when she 
understood Kei was just interested in Kazuya, not May

Yeah, Katsumi thought to herself happily, I guess I really have got it 
bad for her. Katsumi gently closed her diary with a broad smile, got 
up from her desk and quickly got dressed. A white pair of panties, 
short shorts, a top that showed her cleavage, and she was ready to go 
over. Step, step, step along the ladder stretched out over the gap 
between the apartments. She stopped at the window and smiled as she 
looked in and saw May cleaning.

May looked up at her and smiled at her happily as Katsumi opened the 
living room window and climbed in quietly. &quot;Good morning, Katsumi,&quot; 
May said to her cheerfully, and Katsumi felt her heart melt yet 
again...

Author&#39;s notes: I&#39;ve only seen the first four episodes of the series, 
so when I read the &#39;fanfiction challange&#39; on the series, I was a bit 
stumped. But after watching the episodes again, it occured to me that 
Katsumi&#39;s various actions could be read as a romantic interest in May. 
It was a bit of a stretch, but do-able. This might become the first 
piece of a larger fiction, depending on how inspired I am. Anyway, let 
me know what you think. </pre>
