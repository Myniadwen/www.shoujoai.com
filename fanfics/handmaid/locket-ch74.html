&quot;All right,&quot; Misaki Saiki said, the white haired young
woman removing her long overcoat to reveal black
leather fetish wear, &quot;what&#39;s the problem?&quot;

Aeisugawa Juri didn&#39;t even blink at the woman&#39;s odd
choice of dress, having seen much stranger things over
the time she had been running this bar. &quot;It seems the
place is haunted,&quot; Juri said with a casual shrug

&quot;Huh,&quot; Misaki murmured as she looked around
thoughtfully, her red eyes narrowed a bit in thought.

Her partner, the blonde haired business type Haruna
Tamura asked, &quot;What sort of things have been
happening?&quot;

Alpha smiled tentatively, the green haired android
looking faintly nervous, &quot;Objects have been moving
around on their own, there&#39;s been writing on the
walls...&quot;

&quot;In what looks like blood,&quot; Ryouko said, the blue
haired former space pirate standing behind the bar.

&quot;And it spoke through my partner Keiko,&quot; May said, the
brown haired cyberdoll looking remarkably annoyed.

&quot;Is that why everyone here is not human?&quot; Misaki asked
perceptively.

&quot;This thing hurt Keiko,&quot; Juri said flatly, &quot;I won&#39;t
risk anyone else being hurt until I know what&#39;s going
on.&quot;

&quot;Yet you&#39;re still here,&quot; Misaki noted.

&quot;I run the place,&quot; Juri shrugged, &quot;it&#39;s my
responsibility.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;d better get this solved,&quot; Misaki said
as she strode to the center of the room. There was a
eerie calm around her, almost as if the air was afraid
to move, then a odd blueish glow sprung up.

&quot;She&#39;s starting,&quot; Haruna said as she gestured for all
of them to stay back.

&quot;Bet Washu&#39;d love to see this,&quot; Ryouko muttered.

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Minagi agreed, the twin
sister of Ryouko cleaning a glass refexedly.

&quot;I hope we don&#39;t hurt it,&quot; Mahoro frowned, her black
hair tied back in a pony tail.

&quot;For a combat android you can be a bit too
compassionate,&quot; Ryouko noted.

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen a ghost before,&quot; Alpha confessed as
she saw the lights swirling around Misaki, &quot;I wonder
if it&#39;s like the Misago?&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Haruna waved them to silence as she saw Misaki
was about to speak.

&quot;Uhm, hello?&quot; the girl&#39;s voice was tentative.

Juri waited a moment, then decided to answer. &quot;My name
is Juri,&quot; she said, feeling fairly foolish, &quot;you&#39;re in
my bar, Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

&quot;You can hear me!&quot; the girl squealed happily, &quot;I tried
talking to all of you before but I never got through!&quot;

&quot;All that oddness was her idea of talking?&quot; May
frowned.

&quot;Let it go,&quot; Ryouko patted her arm.

&quot;And you are?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;Sayo Aisaka,&quot; a short bow, &quot;I came in with my friend,
but...I can&#39;t seem to leave!&quot; With that she began to
sob softly.

&quot;Who was the friend you came in with?&quot;Alpha asked
reasonably.

&quot;Asakura-san,&quot; Sayo sniffled softly, &quot;from Mahora
academy.&quot;

&quot;Mahora.. Mahora..&quot; Juri snapped her fingers, &quot;I
remember!&quot; She turned, &quot;Get me a phone, I&#39;m calling
Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Setsuna answered after a moment, the part time
nurse and full time Sailor Scout of Time sounding
faintly amused.

&quot;The bad news is that we officially have a ghost,&quot;
Juri answered, &quot;the good news is I think I have a way
of solving the problem.&quot; With that she quickly
sketching in her idea to her lover and partner.

&quot;That&#39;ll involve use of the Time Gate,&quot; Setsuna
murmured, &quot;but yes, I can get her there.&quot; A pause,
&quot;You&#39;re going to owe me, love.&quot;

&quot;And I promise to pay you back,&quot; Juri purred sexily.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right there,&quot; Setsuna said and Juri could
almost hear the grin on her lover&#39;s face.

A few moment&#39;s later Setsuna came through the door,
another young woman looking around her curiously.
&quot;Well, that was unusual,&quot; the young lady muttered, her
short hair standing up in spiky clumps.

&quot;Asakura-san!&quot; Sayo exclaimed happily.

The medium jerked, tensing as a bright light rose from
Misaki&#39;s body, then raced towards Kazumi Asakura,
flitting around her happily as it resolved into the
image of a young girl, her image washed out as many of
the dead were.

&quot;I was getting worried about you,&quot; Kazumi admitted as
the ghost settled happily around her once more.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sayo sounded cutely apologetic, &quot;I came
in with you, but for some reason I couldn&#39;t leave with
you.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Haruna asked, rushing over to
Misaki&#39;s side.

&quot;I will be,&quot; Misaki smiled slightly, &quot;communicating
with the dead takes a lot out of me.&quot;

Haruna helped Misaki up to the bar, both taking seats
as they watched the girl and ghost talking happily.
&quot;Coffee?&quot; she asked and Ryouko produced a cup.

&quot;Nice work,&quot; Juri said as she and Setsuna broke free
from a romantic hug.

&quot;I think this was one of my easier jobs,&quot; Misaki
conceded as she sipped her cup of coffee, the strong
brew restoring some energy to her again.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a more capable medium,&quot;
Setsuna smiled, her greenish black hair falling like a
wave around her, &quot;and trust me, I&#39;ve met a few.&quot; Her
simple work dress still looked lovely on her, hugging
her body without revealing too much.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Haruna said, staying protectively close
to Misaki.

Juri gestured with a thumb towards ghost and girl and
asked wryly, &quot;So is this going to happen again?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Misaki said thoughtfully,
&quot;when I came in I felt... there&#39;s a odd field around
your bar. I think hitting that is what dislodged Sayo.
Now that she knows about it, they should be fine.&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Mahoro sighed in relief.

&quot;Is she for real?&quot; Haruna asked dryly.

&quot;Afraid so,&quot; Ryouko teased.

&quot;It&#39;s almost...beautiful,&quot; Alpha admitted, watching
the ghost seemingly dance around Kazumi, the lady
looking at her ghostly companion fondly.

&quot;So,&quot; Minagi leaned over the bar to ask, &quot;do you want
to try opening tonight, boss?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to try,&quot; Juri admitted as she turned to May,
&quot;let&#39;s hit the phones and see if everyone will come
in.&quot;

&quot;Of course they&#39;ll come in,&quot; May scolded gently as she
drew her phone from a pocket in her apron. She dialed
then smiled, &quot;Keiko? The coast is clear, the ghost is
dealt with.&quot; She snapped the phone shut then looked at
Juri, &quot;On her way.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do Excel and Hyatt,&quot; Juri chuckled and a few
moment&#39;s later they were all doing it.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Kazumi approached Setsuna, Sayo still hugging
her firmly, &quot;I kind of need to get back to my dorm.
It&#39;s already past curfew.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Setsuna smiled. Looking at Juri she
kissed her on the cheek then said, &quot;I&#39;ll be right
back.&quot;

&quot;Thanks love,&quot; Juri stopped her a moment to kiss her
again.

&quot;Do you want to stick around a bit?&quot; Misaki asked
thoughtfully. A slight smile, &quot;It&#39;s odd how these
people don&#39;t seem to be bothered I&#39;m a medium.&quot;

&quot;I get the feeling they&#39;re used to the unusual,&quot;
Haruna answered.

&quot;Too bad I didn&#39;t bring along a change of clothes,&quot;
Misaki looked down at her fetish wear clad body wryly.

&quot;Trust me, we&#39;ve seen racier outfits,&quot; Ryouko
chuckled. &quot;Mind you, you&#39;ll be fighting off the girl&#39;s
dressed in that.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s with me,&quot; Haruna said firmly, taking Misaki&#39;s
hand.

&quot;Drinks are on the house, you two,&quot; Juri said as she
rushed by to help push tables back into place.

&quot;Yes, I think I like this place,&quot; Misaki chuckled.

To be continued...

Utena, Alpha is from Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, Ryouko
and Minagi are from Tenchi Muyo, May is from Hand Maid

Notes: I didn&#39;t feel like writing a regular Halloween
episode, so I thought it might be cool to have a ghost
haunting story instead. I introduced &quot;Haruna Tamura&quot;
in my Ghost Talker fic Two Lives...</pre>
