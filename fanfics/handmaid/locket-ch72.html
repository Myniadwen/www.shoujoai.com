Usagi Tsukino sang cheerfully on the kareoke stage,
her blonde hair gleaming in two long streams down her
back, &quot;I wish I was a lesbian, I wish I was a dyke,
I&#39;d hang with KD Lang, Mel Gibson take a hike....&quot;

&quot;Y&#39;know, a few years ago Rei would have killed to hear
that,&quot; Minako Aino looked amused, the lovely blonde
drinking her soda.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Seiya Kou agreed, her long black
hair falling in a ponytail down her back, the slight
bulge of breasts beneath her black suit signifying her
gender. She watched Usagi with caring and a barely
concealed longing, her eyes gentle and caring.

&quot;Ditto,&quot; Haruka Tenoh nodded glumly, the sandy haired
woman drinking from her own bottle of beer. Both she
and Seiya watched each other warily, a subtle sense of
irritation hanging in the air between them

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Usagi asked as she bounced down
to a seat nearby, her shirt a bit sticky with sweat.

&quot;Not bad at all,&quot; Michiru Kaoru laughed happily, green
hair swirling around her pretty face as she cuddled
with Haruka.

Up at the bar Tina took a drink of blood mixed with
wine, the lovely blonde looking faintly amused.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to sound
disbelieving, it&#39;s just that this is the first bar
I&#39;ve bveen in that knowingly serves vampires... at
least, the first that isn&#39;t vampire owned.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Arisugawa Juri nodded, her orange
hair gleaming in the indirect lighting, &quot;that&#39;s
perfectly understandable.&quot; Her tight dress hugged her
body as she gave Tina a thoughtful look and asked,
&quot;Has anyone explained our rules for vampires?&quot;

&quot;No hypnosis,&quot; Tina nodded, her own short dress giving
the occassional flash of creamy thigh, &quot;no unwilling
victims and no permanent harm.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Juri nodded, &quot;follow those rules and
you&#39;re good.&quot; She studied Tina a moment, &quot;I still find
it hard to grasp that you&#39;re over two hundred years
old.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t look it,&quot; Tina acknowledged. In fact she
looked like a teenager, and probably would have been
carded under other circumstances. As it was Cyber Six
had nearly stopped her at the door until Tina was able
to convince her that she was a vampire and therefore
older than she looked.

Ryouko wiped the top of the bar down, nodding to both
of them in a lull of conversation. The blue haired
space pirate offered Tina a refill ever as she quietly
adressed Juri, &quot;We&#39;ve got a problem at the front
door.&quot;

Juri raised her eyebrow then nodded, &quot;Understood.&quot;

Politely excusing herself Juri was off, cutting
through the crowd easily, nodding gretings to friends
and coworkers as she made her way to the front hall of
the bar. As she walked up the short dark corridor Juri
frowned slightly, hearing an loud argument going on
outside as she neared the open front door.

&quot;May I ask why I&#39;m not allowed in?&#39;, she asked. her
tone carrying just a bit of menace in it.

Juri nodded hello to Cyber Six as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll
handle this.&quot; She looked over at the woman who was
waiting along with several scantily clad younger
ladies, &quot;Hello, Goldie. I thought I told you that
you&#39;re banned for life?&quot;

Goldie Muso smiled back, the elegant looking woman
meeting Juri&#39;s furious gaze quite calmly. &quot;I would
have thought you&#39;d reconsider that by now,&quot; she said
to Juri mildly, her dyed black hair falling down her
back.

&quot;You tried to deal your drugs inside the Locket,&quot;
Juri&#39;s voice was flat and cold, &quot;that&#39;s something I
will not tolerate.&quot;

&quot;You might want to reconsider that,&quot; Goldie answered
with a smile. She snapped her fingers, &quot;Mary-Anne?&quot;

The black haired girl smiled sweetly, &quot;Hello, Miss
Arisugawa.&quot; Still smiling, she pulled a pistol and
moved it towards her temple, &quot;If you don&#39;t let
Mistress in, I&#39;ll have to..&quot;.

WHACK!

Before Mary-Anne could finish a wooden practice sword
came out of nowhere, slapping the weapon out of her
hand and bringing on a cry of pain. The slim young
woman scowled, her long blue overcoat swirling around
her as she let the sword rest against her shoulder. &quot;I
don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on,&quot; the dark brown haired
woman said crossly, &quot;but I don&#39;t like it.&quot;

&quot;Ichigo,&quot; the young woman beside her scolded softly,
her beautiful dress covered with ruffles and frills,
&quot;they might be doing cosplay or something....&quot;

&quot;Who...?&quot; Goldie started but Cyber Six was already on
the move. Faster than you could say she swiftly
disarmed the three girls with Goldie, guns and knives
clattering to the ground.

&quot;She doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Juri said flatly, drawing
Goldie&#39;s attention to her again. &quot;If you come here
again,&quot; Juri continued on grimly, &quot;not only will I ban
you, I&#39;ll throw my full resources in shutting you
down.&quot;

Goldie looked amused, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Rally Vincent and Misty would love the sort
of information I can get,&quot; Juri explained, &quot;not to
mention how tenuous your hold on Chicago&#39;s families
is. If I or my allies start mixing in... who knows
what&#39;ll happen.&quot;

There was a long moment of silence as Goldie and Juri
exchanged glances, then Goldie nodded slightly. &quot;This
isn&#39;t over,&quot; she said. collecting her three slave
girls and walking away.

&quot;I wish we could rescue those girls,&quot; Cyber Six
growled softly, her black hair falling into her
narrowed eyes.

&quot;Not here or now,&quot; Juri shook her head firmly, &quot;I
asked Rally about them once.&quot; Bleakly she explained.
&quot;Acording to her Goldie&#39;s got all the girl&#39;s
brainwashed to commit suicide if they&#39;re taken away
from her.&quot;

&quot;I still don&#39;t like it,&quot; Cyber Six answered her
grimly. She hesitated a second, &quot;Sorry she caught me
off guard.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve ran into her before and it surprised me,&quot; Juri
answered honestly as Cyber Six returned to her post at
the door. She turned to the two newcomers and said,
&quot;That was a very brave and foolish thing you did,
Ms...?&quot;

&quot;Ichiko Shirayuri,&quot; the taller one offered her hand in
a remarkably boyish gesture, her long hair tied back
by a simple length of cloth.

&quot;Her real name is Ichigo,&quot; the smaller woman smiled
sweetly, her light brown hair falling over her
shoulders, &quot;and I am Momoko Ryugasaki.&quot; She curtsied
in a old fashioned sort of way, &quot;It&#39;s very nice to
meet you.&quot;

&quot;You know I don&#39;t like to be called Ichigo,&quot; the
taller girl hissed to her girlfriend, &quot;it doesn&#39;t suit
my girl-biker gang image.&quot;

Juri had to fight a smile at the two of them. &quot;Either
way thank you for your help,&quot; Juri said, &quot;and welcome
to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s cool,&quot; Ichiko smiled as they headed ion after
Juri.

&quot;You thik my father is cool,&quot; Momoko rolled her eyes
with some amusement, &quot;still, you could be right.&quot;

&quot;How did you hear about this place?&#39; Ichiko asked as
they entered the main room of the busy club, teeming
with young and oler women.

Momoko looked amused, &quot;Actually Sir Isobe told me.&quot;

&quot;From the Baby shop?&quot; Ichiko looked surprised.

&quot;Yes, aparently one or two of his models frequent
here,&quot; Momoko explained. She drew a bit closer to
Ichiko as she added, &quot;He commented on how close we
were and suggested this.&quot;

&quot;You think he knows...?&quot; Ichiko asked, her blue eyes
narrowing. &quot;If he made any cracks about us I&#39;ll....&quot;
she scowled.

Momoko slapped her arm on the gently. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t,&quot;
she said firly. Her lips curled up in a smile,
&quot;Actually, he congradulated me on finding someone so
well suited to me.&quot;

&quot;Man&#39;s got better eyes than I though,&quot; Ichiko
admitted, gently squeezing Momoko&#39;s hand.

To be continued....
