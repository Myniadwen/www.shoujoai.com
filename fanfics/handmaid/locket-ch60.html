<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 60 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../handmaid/index.html">Hand Maid May</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../handmaid/locket-ch59.html">Back to Part 59</a><pre>Halloween: The Vampire&#39;s Ball Part One

Tendo Nabiki looked stylish as she loosened the thin
black tie, the black haired young woman&#39;s simple suit
hugging her boyish frame. At her side Ayaka held on to
her arm possessively, the taller woman in the slinky
red dress looking oddly depressed even in all of the
white makeup that they both wore.

The bar itself had been remade in a gothic vein for
this Halloween, blood red and midnight black drapes
with eerie lamps set around the intwentionally dim
room. The old, half melted candles up on the bar were
a very nice touch, along with a few fake skulls, bats
from the ceiling, cobwebs and all the other
traditional touches.

&quot;So why did I agree to do a theme night for
halloween?&quot; Juri asked, the orange haired beauty
looking oddly delicate in her tight gown.

Ryouko chuckled, the black leather clad space alien
saying, &quot;Because Setsuna wanted to see you in that
dress?&quot;

&quot;Well, there is that,&quot; Juri admitted.

&quot;And this kind of thing is a great seller,&quot; Nabiki
jumped in. She dropped her voice slightly, &quot;Sorry I
haven&#39;t been around so much lately.&quot;

&quot;Where the two of you been?&quot; Minagi asked, leaning
forward so that the silver collar and leash she wore
clinked on the bar top. Her own outfit was a leather
catsuit, hugging each and every generous curve.

Ayaka gave her a slightly bitter smile, &quot;We haven&#39;t
been romping in a love nest, if that&#39;s what you
think.&quot; Seriously she continued, &quot;I&#39;ve... had some
troubles, recently.&quot;

Juri kept her face carefully blank, not revealing that
she already knew some details of those troubles. In
between financial emails Nabiki had sketched in the
situation: on what looked like a routine exorcism
Ayaka&#39;s Phantom Quest Corp had encountered an elder
demon, one far too powerful for them to handle
unprepared. It defeated them utterly, then to add
insult to injury it killed her business manager, a boy
named Mamoru. In a rage Ayaka had called upon power
she didn&#39;t know she had to obliterate the demon, but
she couldn&#39;t save her friend.

&quot;If there&#39;s anything I can do,&quot; Juri carefully
offered, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll let me know.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Arisugawa-san,&quot; Ayaka answered her
gravely, &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot;

From the kitchen Hitomi called out, &quot;Do I really have
to wear this?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re all in theme outfits tonight,&quot; Juri called back
as Ayaka quietly moved off, &quot;you have to dress up,
too.&quot;

With a sigh Hitomi stepped out, wearing a school
girl&#39;s uniform. Her outfit was pure black, lace at the
collar, sleeve and hem of her skirt, making the brown
haired girl look a little like some darkside porcelin
doll. Her hair was carefully styled, curled just
enough to be cute, the bone white makeup darkening her
grave eyes.

&quot;So how do I look?&quot; Hitomi asked nervously.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Mahoro simply commented, the black haired
former combat android adjusting her maid&#39;s outfit
carefully.

&quot;You&#39;ll make them swoon,&quot; Milerna agreed, her own
black pirate&#39;s clothes artfully ripped.

&quot;The tables are all set up,&quot; Excel reported, Hyatt
following behind her to wave at them weakly, &quot;I think
we&#39;re ready to go.&quot;

Sasami stuck her head out of the kitchen, &quot;The dishes
are all ready to go.&quot; The little girl wore a black
dress that gave her an oddly regal manner, her eyes
sparkling slightly, &quot;And the &#39;blood punch&#39; you asked
for is ready to go, too.&quot;

&quot;Blood?&quot; Bones raised her eyebrows. The muscular
woman&#39;s long leather coat flowed around her, almost
looking like a dark cloak or maybe devil&#39;s wings.

&quot;Fruit juices, mostly,&quot; Sasami explained, &quot;but it
looks thick and red.&quot;

&quot;Sorry! I&#39;m so late,&quot; Keiko rushed inside, the young
woman&#39;s black suit rakishly untidy and her log brown
braid flowing behind her.

Behind her May had a slightly sheepish smile on her
face, her own long black dress slightly askew. &quot;Sorry,
Juri-sama,&quot; May bowed.

&quot;It happens,&quot; Juri smirked, having a pretty good idea
what had held them up. Almost in confirmation both
woman looked at each other, blushing faintly.

Minagi chuckled softly, looking up to check out the
clock. &quot;Looks like it&#39;s time to get going,&quot; she
offered, &quot;everyone ready?&quot;

&quot;Lets go,&quot; Juri seriously agreed.

Almost as soon as the doors were open customers
streamed in, each wearing their own variations on the
evening&#39;s theme. Mixed amid the undead were a few
witches and sorceresses, military officers and other
favorite costumes, the mood purely joyous.

&quot;Somehow, Lina,&quot; the tall black haired woman in simple
clothes and leathers said as she looked around warily,
&quot;I don&#39;t think this is an ordinary bar.&quot;

The fiery redhead nodded slightly, &quot;You&#39;ve got that
right, Naga.&quot; Lina Inverse looked at the shorter girl
beside them, &quot;What do you think, Amelia?&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Amelia&#39;s eyes were wide as she watched two
women in barely there ragged clothes danced together
closely. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she looked back at Lina and Naga, &quot;I
don&#39;t get the feeling of evil around this place,
though.&quot;

Naga nodded thoughtfully, her motion shifting the
sword across her back as she said, &quot;Then it&#39;s probably
all right to grab a meal here, as long as we keep our
guard up.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Lina grinned, eagerly leading the way towards
the bar.

&quot;Lina-san,&quot; May blinked in surprise as she recognized
her. Sternly the brown haired woman said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
but we won&#39;t be running a tab for you.&quot;

Amelia blinked in surprise, &quot;Lina, you&#39;ve been here
before?&quot;

&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; Lina looked honestly confused as
she speculated, &quot;maybe they know me by my reputation?&quot;

May smiled slightly as she led the three women over to
a table, &quot;It&#39;s a bit complicated, but I&#39;m well aware
of all your eating habits.&quot;

Over by the enterance two figures hesitantly entered,
looking around curiously. Hitomi beamed, Welcome to
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket!&quot; A pause, &quot;Those are lovely angel
costumes.&quot;

The tall black haired woman looked at Hitomi
curiouasly even as she put out a cigarette. A halo
glowed above her head, wings the most delicate shade
of ash extending from her back. She smiled wryly,
&quot;It&#39;s not a costume, and we&#39;re Haibane.&quot;

&quot;Reiki,&quot; the brown haired girl murmured, giving her a
frown. She looked over at Hitomi curiously, &quot;Are we
still within the Wall?&quot;

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Hitomi answered, sensing that this was
important to the two of them. Smiling she nodded to
the door outside and said reassuringly, &quot;Once you step
back out that door, you&#39;ll be back in your home once
again.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Reiki nodded. She looked at her
companion, a much gentler expression appearing on her
face as she said, &quot;You want to look around, Rakka?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Rakka beamed and the two women went inside
together.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Hitomi murmured, watching them move off. Rakka
seemed so innocent, looking around in wide eyed wonder
while Reki was harder, more cynical. Yet somehow, the
two women fit together, almost like two halves of one
soul.

&quot;Getting distracted?&quot; Milerna surprised her, swiftly
wrapping her arms around her smaller lover from
behind.

&quot;Always, with you around,&quot; Hitomi agreed with a smile.
