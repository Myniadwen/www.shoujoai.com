Saotome Ranma smiled as the redheaded young woman
leaned up against the wall, watching passerby warily
as the customers lined up to get in the club. As one
of the part-time bouncers she rather enjoyed her work,
though her watching the ladies did sometimes get her
in trouble with her girlfriend.

&quot;Hey, Ranma,&quot; Tendo Nabiki nodded as the black haired
young woman walked up, her lover Ayaka Kisaragi
holding on to her arm. The lovely redheaded exorcist
looked surprisingly content on Nabiki&#39;s arm, a warm
smile on her face.

&quot;Good evening,&quot; Ranma held the door open gentlemanly
as they walked by not to mention taking the
opportunity to get a good look at their bodies.

&quot;Watch it, Saotome,&quot; Nabiki warned under her breath.

Inside the club it was as busy as ever as people
crowded the tables, waiters and waitresses rushing
back and forth to pick up and drop off orders. Tables
were packed, drinks were flowing and friends were
talking happily.

&quot;Here&#39;s the order of beers for Asagiri&#39;s table,&quot;
Ryouko grinned, her blue mane flowing as she passed
the tray over.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; May smiled as she grabbed the tray with one
hand and the food with the other as she hurried
through the mob, her long brown hair bouncing. Dressed
in one of her many maid&#39;s outfits she swept through
the customers, a friendly smile clearing the way.

Priss Asagiri nodded in greeting as May reached the
table, dropping the beers off gracefully. &quot;Thank you,&quot;
Silvie smiled charmingly, the brown haired young woman
helping clear a bit of the table off for her.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; May beamed.

Priss grinned, &quot;We&#39;d like to book an upstairs room
later, too.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; May nodded, &quot;just check with Nabiki or
Alpha for room availability.&quot;

&quot;We will,&quot; Silvie nodded as May was leaving. Silvie
turned to Priss and smiled warmly, &quot;I still would like
to know why you followed me that night.&quot;

Priss shrugged a bit uncomfortably, the dark haired
woman taking a drink of her beer. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she
admitted, &quot;just a feeling I had.&quot; She smiled, &quot;Though
I think you could have handled those Doberman Boomers
on your own.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Silvie reached out to squeeze Priss&#39; hand,
&quot;I&#39;m just glad that I didn&#39;t have to.&quot;

Keiko fought back a smile as she moved between tables
and away from the conversation, her long brown
ponytail bouncing against her back. Tonight she wore a
man&#39;s suit, altered for her thin figure along with the
matching shoes and gloves. She knew the look fit her,
and even better May liked her in it.

&quot;Yo,&quot; the brown haired girl with the ponytails waved.

&quot;Hi there,&quot; Keiko hurried over, &quot;can I take your
order?&quot;

&quot;Juice for me,&quot; the ponytailed girl smiled, &quot;I&#39;m still
in training.&quot; She looked over at the dark purple
haired girl, &quot;Ayuki?&quot;

&quot;A Cola I think,&quot; Ayuki Mori smiled back, &quot;thanks,
Tomari.&quot;

Tomari Kurusu chuckled then looked at the other two
women at the table questioningly, &quot;Hazumu, Yasuna?&quot;

Hazumu Osaragi smiled shyly, the taller redheaded girl
holding onto Yasuna&#39;s hand. &quot;Another soda, I think,&quot;
she said.

Yasuna Kamizumi smiled at Hazumu, &quot;Sounds good to me,
too.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Keiko said, &quot;I&#39;ll be back with your
drinks in a moment.&quot;

&quot;So you heard about this club on-line?&quot; Hazumu asked
Tomari curiously.

&quot;I was doing some research after you two became
officially involved,&quot; Tomari said to them teasingly,
&quot;this club came up on the search.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Yasuna said, looking around her in awe.
Both she and Hazumu were wearing similar dresses,
though Hazumu&#39;s was decorated in a more floral style.
She looked over at Tomari and Ayuki, &quot;And what&#39;s this
I hear about you being involved?&quot;

Tellingly, both Tomari and Ayuki blushed, though Ayuki
recovered first. &quot;Yes, we&#39;re dating,&quot; she conceded,
&quot;but that&#39;s all for now.&quot;

Keiko delivered the drinks then moved off, but staying
nearby wiping off tables to listen in. She like
hearing about first love, it was such a charming thing
really. And it reminded her of how her heart jumped
meeting May the first time...

Hazumu beamed as she said, &quot;I&#39;m so happy for both of
you!&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Tomari managed to say through her blush.

Ayuki looked over at Yasuna thoughtfully, &quot;How did you
find out?&quot;

&quot;Someone saw you down by the river,&quot; a warm smile
curled Yasuna&#39;s lips as she revealed, &quot;when you were
kissing.&quot;

&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Tomari blushed again. She looked over at
Ayuki in silent appeal, clearly unwilling to continue
to discuss this.

Ayuki rose smoothly, her dress swirling around her
legs as she smiled at Tomari, &quot;I think you promised me
a dance?&quot;

With a sigh of relief Tomari got up and smiled, &quot;I&#39;d
love to.&quot;

Upstairs Arisugawa Juri pushed herself away from her
desk and the paperwork, stretching out tiredly. &quot;Poor
baby,&quot; Setsuna Meiou murmured, the tall black haired
woman curled up on the couch nearby.

&quot;I swear this is the one bane of my existence,&quot; Juri
confessed, her orange hair pulled back by a simple set
of hair clips tonight.

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Setsuna agreed warmly,
&quot;paperwork is a pain up at the hospital, too.&quot; She
peered at Juri&#39;s desk, &quot;What are you working on?&quot;

&quot;The accounts,&quot; Juri smiled wryly, &quot;Nabiki&#39;s coming in
to review them, today.&quot;

&quot;How is she and Ayaka doing?&quot; Setsuna looked curious.

Nabiki and Ayaka had been dating somewhat seriously
for several moths now, carrying on through mutual
stresses. Nabiki was working to establish herself as a
freelance accountant while Ayaka&#39;s business was still
getting back on it&#39;s feet, creating stresses on both
of them.

Juri actually grinned, &quot;Nabiki popped the question and
Ayaka said yes.&quot;

Setsuna sat up, smiling, &quot;Seriously?&quot;

&quot;Ring and everything,&quot; Juri confirmed. She sat back,
her woman&#39;s tailored suit wrinkled a bit, &quot;According
to Nabiki she took Ayaka out for a picnic, they ate
lunch then she snuck the ring out and proposed.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so romantic,&quot; Setsuna sighed happily.

Juri slipped from her chair, walking over to Setsuna&#39;s
side, She bent over and kissed the sitting woman
gently, her eyes twinkling. &quot;Do you want to go to bed
early tonight?&quot; she offered impishly once they broke
off the kiss.

Setsuna chuckled softly, a blush coloring her cheeks
as she purred back, &quot;I think so, but you won&#39;t be
getting much sleep.&quot;

&quot;Promises, promises,&quot; Juri grinned just as they heard
a tapping at the door.

&quot;Arisugawa,&quot; Nabiki nodded, a wicked smile teasing her
lips as she saw both women trying to look casual.

&quot;Are we interrupting?&quot; Ayaka purred, her red hair
flowing in a glossy wave.

&quot;No, we&#39;re fine,&quot; Juri said, &quot;nice to see you.&quot;

The ring on Ayaka&#39;s finger glittered, gold and
diamonds in a expensive but stylish design.
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Setsuna said to them both, nodding
towards the ring.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nabiki grinned.
