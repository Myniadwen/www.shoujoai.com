&quot;This is Himiko Tenkawa, reporting from the city of
Megatokyo,&quot; the brown haired woman said, the wreckage
of a city rearing up behind her, &quot;where days of
pitched conflict between Boomers, AD Police and
mercenary forces have finally come to an end.&quot;

The camera panned over refugee camps set up around the
city, then cut to images of AD Police leading captured
forces, some of the captive&#39;s jump suits bearing
company logos of Nergal, Bioware and other firms.
Battered and bloody AD Police officers watched them
warily, accompanied by equally grim mercenary
fighters.

&quot;Details are still sketchy of what went on within the
city over the past few days,&quot; Himiko continued. &quot;As
many of you know corporate forces sealed off the city
in an illegal move three days ago, and the Japanese
government was unable to decide on a course of action,
despite evidence of a armed conflict within the city.&quot;

There was a burst of static and Himiko looked up,
touching her earpiece and listening to a transmission
from her station. A male voice over announced, &quot;We&#39;re
receiving a transmission from within the city, cutting
to it now.&quot;

More static, then the image resolved to a TV studio
within Megatokyo. A blonde haired woman in a sailor
fuku stood, her golden hair falling in twin streams
down her back and a gold tiara on her brow. Despite
her nearly mythic status everyone recognized Sailor
Moon, even those who might have denied her existence.
Beside her stood a silver armored member of the Knight
Sabers, a older woman in AD Police uniform and a red
haired man in a black business suit.

&quot;This broadcast should be reaching all of Japan, as
well as the world,&quot; Sailor Moon said, her blue eyes
grave, &quot;there are things you need to know.&quot;

&quot;Can you confirm that,&quot; Himiko whispered off screen.
An answer and she spoke up, &quot;Yes, this signal appeared
to be pirating frequencies globally!&quot;

&quot;Over the past few days the private armies of several
international firms attempted to take over the city of
Megatokyo, in the process needlessly slaughtering
thousands of citizens. We,&quot; Sailor Moon gestured to
the people standing beside her, &quot;have successfully
stopped the takeover, and will offer whatever
assistance we can in bringing those responsible to
justice.&quot;

Nene Romanova stepped forward, her eyes grim as she
said, &quot;I am formally charging the heads of Nergal,
Bioware and others with multiple counts of murder,
conspiracy to commit murder and corporate espionage. I
expect the local governments involved to cooperate
with extradition of these individuals.&quot;

&quot;And before you start calling frame up,&quot; the silver
Knight Saber spoke up, &quot;we have sworn testimony and
recovered data trails. If needed, we will provide them
directly to the international news media and law
enforcement.&quot;

&quot;Finally,&quot; Touga Kiryuu added, his red hair flowing,
&quot;we have all the details of the financial maneuvers,
including the hiring of mercenary forces to help take
over the city.&quot;

Sailor Moon spoke up again, her stance becoming
somewhat regal, somehow. &quot;Today, we are also putting
the governments of the world on notice,&quot; she said
gravely, &quot;we will not tolerate such a act again. I do
not know who cooperated with this attempted takeover,
or at least I&#39;m not sure enough to name them, but if
something like this happens again we will not only
prevent it, we will personally deal with those
responsible.&quot;

With that the transmission came to an end, leaving
shock and confusion in it&#39;s wake. &quot;An incredible
broadcast,&quot; Himiko managed to recover as she
continued, &quot;we will have to wait and see the world&#39;s
reaction, but...&quot;

Daley Wong pushed open the door to the temporary
office of the new head of the AD Police, the brown
haired officer pausing as he took in the acting chief.
&quot;Reporting for duty, ma&#39;am,&quot; he said quietly, glasses
gleaming.

&quot;Daley,&quot; Nene looked up from her desk, her face lined
with weariness, &quot;you have no idea how good it is to
see you.&quot; The blonde haired woman got up, went over
and hugged him as she murmured, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry about
Leon.&quot;

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Daley said quietly. He followed her
in, taking a seat with a weary sigh, &quot;It&#39;s crazy out
there.&quot;

Nene nodded as she sat down, rubbing at her face with
her hands. &quot;Looting is running rampant, and we&#39;re
asking for any police officers around the country to
help out,&quot; she confessed. She looked up at him, &quot;Any
chance of you taking this job off my hands?&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re stuck,&quot; Daley conceded.

The public reaction to the battle for Megatokyo, not
to mention the AD Police, was immense. And as the
defacto leader of the AD Police Nene had found herself
thrust into the spotlight, as well as acquiring a John
Wayne like glamor. The idea of her becoming the next
chief was spontaneous but nearly irresistible to
politicians and regular folks alike.

Daley dropped his voice a bit, &quot;I heard about Mackie,
I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;

Nene closed her eyes, her face pained. Mackie had
never awakened after he had been shot, and despite the
best efforts of Sylia and Washu, he had quietly passed
on in the night. &quot;He saved us all,&quot; Nene said quietly,
&quot;and most people will never even know it.&quot;

Daley nodded, his own expression sad as he asked, &quot;But
would he have cared?&quot;

&quot;No, I guess not,&quot; Nene conceded.

&quot;Are the others sticking around?&quot; Daley asked
curiously.

&quot;The Kiryuu family is helping, as well as Utena and
her friends,&quot; Nene revealed, &quot;and Sylia&#39;s doing
forensic work for us on the destroyed Boomers. The
rest are all pitching in where they can, I think.&quot;

&quot;I saw the broadcast you all did,&quot; Daley said
thoughtfully, &quot;on the way in here. Who&#39;s idea was
that?&quot;

&quot;Mine and Sailor Moon&#39;s,&quot; Nene said seriously. &quot;I hate
giving the criminals a heads up, but I wanted to make
sure no one in power could try to cover things up
somehow.&quot;

&quot;You think someone in government was involved with
this?&quot; Daley asked grimly.

Nene shrugged slightly, &quot;When the boomer rampage
started we appealed for assistance and no one came.&quot;
She smiled coldly, &quot;Either way, I intend to find out.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Daley agreed. He smiled coldly as he mused,
&quot;And I bet your hackers are already hard at work?&quot;

&quot;Lisa&#39;s leading the effort,&quot; Nene&#39;s eyes looked a bit
haunted, &quot;I think she sees it as doing a kind of
penance.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t blame herself...?&quot; Daley asked.

&quot;A bit,&quot; Nene sighed sadly, &quot;though I&#39;ve told her that
I don&#39;t blame her for what happened to Mackie down
there.&quot;

Meanwhile, a somber gathering of friends came together
at a exclusive club called Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Juri
Arisugawa raised a glass, her orange hair gleaming as
she said, &quot;To Keiko Sonoda, you will not be
forgotten.&quot;

&quot;To Keiko,&quot; the voices rang out.

May smiled sadly as she echoed her lover&#39;s name, her
eyes red from tears.

Sylia Stingray rose, her silvery hair gleaming as she
took a turn, &quot;To Mackie...&quot; She trailed off, reaching
up to wipe at a tear, &quot;Goodbye, little brother. I&#39;ll
miss you.&quot;

Washu raised her cup, others following as they echoed,
&quot;To Mackie.&quot;

Finally Minako Aino rose, her long blonde hair
glittering. &quot;To Natsuna Haruna,&quot; she declared, &quot;who
did her duty to the end.&quot;

&quot;Natsuna,&quot; they echoed, the police among then putting
some extra force behind it.

&quot;Nene isn&#39;t here?&quot; Urd noted as they settled down to
some serious drinking, the dusky skinned goddess
sitting close to Priss.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s up to a wake right now,&quot; Ryouko
said from her usual spot behind the bar. She, Minagi
and Mahoro passed out free drinks, as ordered by Juri
earlier that night.

Utena, Juri, Sailor Moon and Sylia had soon retired to
a quiet corner, the four talking together with grave
looks on their faces. &quot;What do you think&#39;s going on?&quot;
Rei Hino asked, her long black hair shimmering.

Touga took a drink of his beer, &quot;There&#39;s going to be
fall out from our speaking out publically. I suspect
they&#39;re planning on how to deal with it.&quot;

&quot;You going to be all right?&quot; May asked him softly, the
brown haired cyberdoll dressed in mourning black.

&quot;Our family has enough power and influence, we should
be fine,&quot; his sister Nanami noted calmly, her husband
Miki standing nearby.

Miki pushed his slightly messy blue hair back from his
face as he gently asked May, &quot;How are you managing?&quot;

&quot;Day by day,&quot; May shrugged sadly.

&quot;So,&quot; Usagi met the other&#39;s eyes, &quot;we&#39;re agreed?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll stay in closer touch from now on,&quot; Utena
agreed, &quot;if something like this happens again, we&#39;ll
deal with it together.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Sylia nodded.

&quot;The Locket can serve as a ventral meeting place,&quot;
Juri added, &quot;I&#39;ll talk to Washu about setting up some
kind of permanent link for each of us.&quot;

Usagi looked bashful, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I jumped too fast
in being in charge, I&#39;m just used to it with the other
senshi...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Utena smiled at her.

&quot;We needed someone in charge,&quot; Sylia added, &quot;and
you&#39;re quite good at it.&quot;

&quot;Look at that blush,&quot; Juri chuckled as Usagi went red.

Skuld sat on the bar, drinking glumly as she said, &quot;I
wish we could have done more.&quot;

Belldandy put her hand on Skuld&#39;s shoulder as the
light brown haired goddess said, &quot;Some things humanity
must face on it&#39;s own.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not much of a comfort to the dead,&quot; Mara noted
sadly.

Meanwhile, three other women drank quietly in a
corner, having slipped in with the rush. The redhead
took a drink as she said, &quot;What do we report to
Misato?&quot;

&quot;That the old NERV facilities are safe, Asuka,&quot; the
blue haired woman shrugged.

&quot;True enough, Rei,&quot; Asuka Soryu Langley conceded, &quot;but
do we trust these people with the tech there?&quot;

Rei Ayanami nodded, &quot;I think they&#39;ve proven
trustworthy.&quot; She turned to the teen sitting with
them, &quot;What do you think, Aria?&quot;

Aria Langley-Ayanami nodded, her blue hair and facial
structure marking her as both their daughters. &quot;I
think it&#39;s fine,&quot; she said then added, &quot;and we can
always keep an eye out. If things go bad we just
detonate the nuke and destroy the facility.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Asuka agreed.

Afterward, 1000 years or so later.

The city of Crystal Tokyo gleamed, shining towers
reaching towards the sky on the place where once such
fierce battles had been fought. In the heart of the
city a young woman listened as the tale was finished,
her black hair falling into her eyes.

&quot;So,&quot; Erica Tenoh asked, &quot;how did you end up within
the computers here at Crystal Tokyo?&quot;

Nene Romanova smiled wryly, her blonde hair falling
into her eyes. Of course, this wasn&#39;t the real Nene,
but a holographic image projected by the city&#39;s
computers. &quot;After being chief a few years I stepped
aside for Daley, then began to tinker with the old
NERV computers,&quot; she revealed.

&quot;And you downloaded yourself into them,&quot; Erica
guessed.

&quot;For a time I thought Mackie&#39;s consciousness might be
in here,&quot; Nene shrugged, &quot;but I guess I was wrong.&quot;

Deciding changing the subject might be best Erica
asked her, &quot;So what happened afterwards?&quot;

&quot;The heads of the companies faced trial and several
were convicted,&quot; Nene recalled, &quot;and they took Sailor
Moon&#39;s threat seriously, at least for awhile.&quot;

&quot;A while?&quot; Erica looked curious.

&quot;It took a few centuries for the warning to wear off
and the corporate wars to start,&quot; Nene noted, &quot;but
that&#39;s a story for another time.&quot;

&quot;Awww,&quot; Erica pouted.

End

Authors Notes: This fic was both long and complicated
to write, and I thank all my readers who stuck with
it. I knew roughly what would happen but the mechanics
evolved as I worked, creating some interesting
difficulties. This story also ties in to almost all my
fave fandoms, so if you&#39;re confused I apologize most
deeply. Heh.</pre>
