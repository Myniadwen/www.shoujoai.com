Touga Kiryuu got the message almost as soon as the two
men arrived in the city, rushing to the hospital as
soon as he could. The redheaded man drove dangerously,
his sleek sports car cutting through the traffic like
a hot knife through butter, but with an almost
unearthly skill.

&quot;I&#39;d really like to get there alive,&quot; Saionji
remarked, holding on to the dashboard with a white
knuckled grip. The green haired swordsman sounded
light hearted but his handsome face was almost as grim
as Touga&#39;s was.

&quot;Oh ye of little faith,&quot; Touga shot back as they came
around a corner. A few moments later they came to a
stop, Touga vaulting out of the car as he asked,
&quot;Which ward?&quot;

&quot;C ward,&quot; Saionji followed him in, watching with some
amusement as Touga smoothly charmed a nurse for
directions. &#39;Wonder what she&#39;d do if she discovered he
was really nearly 60 years old?&#39; he wondered.

The group of familiar figures stood in front of the
glass window, faces that they hadn&#39;t seen in a long
time. Asrisugawa Juri looked coldly angry, her eyes
glittering as she paced, her orange hair falling
around her shoulders. Miki Kaoru had a gently
sorrowful look on his face, the blue haired young man
looking regretfully through the glass wall. His wife
Nanami stood beside him, a comforting hand on his
shoulder while the brash blonde gazed regretfully at
the focus of the whole room.

&quot;How is she?&quot; Touga asked, slowing a little as he
walked over to their side.

&quot;She&#39;s slipped into a coma,&quot; Nanami answered, Touga&#39;s
little sister giving him a sad smile, &quot;they don&#39;t
think she&#39;s going to make it.&quot;

&quot;God,&quot; Saionji ran a hand through his hair roughly,
the katana he usually wore slung over his shoulders.
Grimly he asked, &quot;What happened to her?&quot;

&quot;Attempted murder,&quot; Juri sounded furious as she
continued, &quot;her own employers shot her for trying to
prove they were engaged in criminal actions.&quot;

Touga cursed softly, his eyes narrowing. &quot;Where&#39;s
Utena?&quot; he asked, knowing that the intense young woman
had to be here somewhere.

&quot;In there,&quot; Miki nodded to Keiko&#39;s room.

Looking inside Touga saw that Utena was bent over the
older woman, her hands carefully resting on Keiko&#39;s
shoulders. There was an aura of power radiating around
her, the ordinarily dressed pink haired young woman
seemingly coexisting with the image of a nobly dressed
prince. Light and strangely the scent of roses even
reached the outer room they waited in, then faded away
as Utena slumped forward, clearly exhausted.

The brown haired young lady who was Keiko&#39;s lover, May
spoke softly to Utena, then Anthy helped Utena leave
the room. The dusky haired woman pushed the door open
while bearing much of the other woman&#39;s weight
herself. Saionji saw them stumble and leapt forward to
help, getting her over to a nearby chair.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Nanami asked, her eyes filled with
worry for her old friend.

&quot;It won&#39;t work,&quot; Utena looked up, eyes filled with
grief, &quot;I called upon the Power of Dios again and
again to save her, but...&quot;

&quot;Utena,&quot; Anthy held her lover close, tears glistening
at the corners of her eyes.

&quot;I remember that Keiko once told me she didn&#39;t want to
be immortal,&quot; Juri finally said into the silence, &quot;it
could be she&#39;s resisting Utena&#39;s attempts to save
her.&quot;

Miki shook his head no, while Nanami closed her eyes
in pain and regret. Touga looked grim, remembering
their shared past, while Saionji had a more gently
regretful look on his face. Both Utena and Anthy
looked weary, body and soul, as they sat nearby each
other there in the white, sterile hospital room

&quot;Who did this?&quot; Touga finally asked, his eyes narrowed
in anger.

Saionji nodded, &quot;And what can we do to help?&quot;

Juri gave them the shadow of her usual smile, &quot;I think
we&#39;re going to have to talk about it, but not here.&quot;
She left them a moment to talk to May in Keiko&#39;s room
then returned to their sides, &quot;May is staying here
with Keiko, she&#39;ll call if anything changes.&quot;

&quot;And where are we going?&quot; Miki asked her as they left,
still tossing anxious glances back towards Keiko&#39;s
room.

&quot;The one place I know where we can talk that&#39;s
completely secure,&quot; Juri answered them all,
&quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

The neon light above the door was out, for the first
time in a long time the bar was closed for the
evening. Juri led them inside, Miki, Saionji and Touga
looking around them bemusedly at the strange
surroundings. Inside much of the staff of the bar
waited, like they had for most of the day for news of
what happened to their friend.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Setsuna Meiou stepped forward to hug her lover
gently, the black haired woman looking at Juri&#39;s face
worriedly.

&quot;Keiko&#39;s still alive,&quot; Juri answered softly.

Minagi looked grim, the former space pirate dressed
for battle in a simple one piece body-suit, her long
blue hair flowing down her back. Tsunami stood beside
her lover, her own expression grave. Cyber Six paced
restlessly, her long black cloak swirling, black hair
falling into her eyes. Nabiki Tendo sat at one of the
tables, a shot of whisky in front of the older woman,
her eyes haunted. Up at the bar Mahoro was taking
apart and cleaning her pistol, from the look on the
black haired woman&#39;s face she intended to be using it
soon.

&quot;I asked the other Sailor Senshi to be here,&quot; Setsuna
added as she nodded to where the other young women
stood, &quot;most of us know Keiko and it seems we&#39;re
involved anyway.&quot;

There was a knock on the door and Sylia Stingray
entered boldly, her long silver hair flowing neatly
down her back. The tawny haired goddess Mara followed
her in, her eyes grave as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about
your friend, Juri, but I&#39;m not sure why you called us
in.&quot;

&quot;I asked you to be called,&quot; Minako Aino, the beautiful
blonde who was also known as Sailor Venus answered,
&quot;you&#39;re involved in this, too.&quot;

Juri took a breath before anyone started asking more
questions. &quot;Keiko was shot last night investigating
her employers at Bioware,&quot; she said crisply, &quot;trying
to find out how they had illegally acquired data from
their primary business rival, Re-genex.&quot;

&quot;Both of which are boomer developers,&quot; Sylia looked
grim.

&quot;It gets worse,&quot; Juri nodded to Minako.

Minako Aino rose, her blonde hair almost a golden cape
as she said, &quot;I was investigating this situation from
another end, corporate espionage, when I broke into
Bioware. Accessing the computers I downloaded data on
the robberies as well as a plan set up between various
companies involving something called Ayanami.&quot;

There was the oddest look on Sylia&#39;s face at the
mention of that name, Mara looking at her lover
worriedly. &quot;You know something,&quot; she prompted Sylia.

&quot;My father&#39;s legacy coming back to bite us on the ass
once again,&quot; Sylia said bleakly. She took a steadying
breath, &quot;Most of you know my father used my DNA in
creating the boomer prototypes, but what is largely
unknown is that there was a second DNA source
involved.&quot;

&quot;Rei Ayanami,&quot; Haruka Tenoh got it almost instantly,
the sandy haired boyish young woman standing with her
lover Michiru.

&quot;So they have something planned using Ayanami&#39;s DNA?&quot;
Miki asked.

&quot;They want to create a second Galatea,&quot; Sylia looked
furious as she growled, &quot;using Ayanami as the template
this time, probably to use the Boomers in the city as
part of a larger scheme.&quot;

&quot;Then we have to stop them,&quot; Usagi Tsukino said
simply, the blonde haired princess of the Moon Kingdom
meeting their eyes with determination.

&quot;It&#39;s too late for that,&quot; Minako sighed, &quot;from the
data I recovered Project Ayanami was already complete.
We have to stop the next step.&quot;

There was a loud click as Mahoro finished reassembling
her pistol. &quot;And what is the next step?&quot; she asked
them crisply.

&quot;The corporate mercenaries,&quot; Sylia said, &quot;we know that
they&#39;re coming into the city in force, they must be
part of the takeover scheme.&quot;

&quot;We need to get the AD Police involved, too,&quot; Ami
Mizuno agreed, &quot;even with everyone in this room we
can&#39;t deal with this on our own.&quot;

The phone rang and Juri moved aside, listening
intently. A few moments later she slipped it away into
her pocket, her voice raspy as she said, &quot;Keiko
slipped away a few minutes ago, she never woke up from
the coma.&quot;</pre>
