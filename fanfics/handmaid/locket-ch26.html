Two girls dressed up in school uniforms are up on the stage, singing 
with Ami Mizuno and Rei Hino backing them up on a pair of keyboards.

&quot;All the things you said, all the things you said, running thorough my 
head, running through my head, running through my head,&quot;

&quot;How did Juri talk them into performing here, anyway?&quot; Minagi asked, 
wiping out a glass smoothly before replacing it in it&#39;s rack.

&quot;Their agent&#39;s trying to boost their credibility,&quot; Nabiki shrugged. A 
slight smile, &quot;And Juri&#39;s Aunt may have owned a substantial amount of 
stock in the record company, too.&quot;

&quot;So where is Juri tonight, anyway?&quot; Ryouko asked Nabiki curiously. It 
was pretty rare for Juri not to be here when the Locket was open.

&quot;Out having dinner with Setsuna,&quot; Nabiki said, keeping an eye on the 
crowd.

&quot;What?&quot; Excel squealed.



Setsuna smiled, meeting Juri at the door. The duelist was dressed in 
one of her long leather jackets, black pants, and a partially 
unbuttoned white shirt. &quot;Right on time,&quot; Setsuna chuckled.

&quot;I never keep a lady waiting,&quot; Juri bowed. Setsuna looked especially 
good tonight, the red dress she had chosen hugging her form nicely. as 
they walked towards Juri&#39;s car she said, &quot;We can do one of two things. 
I&#39;ve made tentative reservations at a restaurant, or we can do 
something a bit more... unusual.&quot;

Juri opened the passenger&#39;s door and Setsuna gracefully sat down. She 
looked at Juri thoughtfully. &quot;How unusual?&quot; she asked.

Juri slid into the driver&#39;s seat, &quot;Very unusual.&quot;

With a little smile Setsuna said, &quot;I eat at restaurants all the time 
anyway.&quot;

They drove to the edge of town, and when they got out Juri opened up 
the trunk and pulled out a large picnic basket with blanket. &quot;Follow 
me,&quot; Juri smiled.

&quot;A picnic isn&#39;t all that unusual,&quot; Setsuna noted.

&quot;It is where we&#39;re going,&quot; Juri said mysteriously. They walked until 
they stood on an open space overlooking the city. Juri smiled and 
said, &quot;Take hold of my arm.&quot;

Setsuna watched as Juri took a large, red stone out of her pocket. It 
glowed faintly, pulsing with the beat of a heart. Juri raised it above 
them, and light began to build up all around them, glowing brighter 
and brighter.

A pathway of light shot into the sky, and they were gone....

... only to reappear, somewhere else. Setsuna had her transformation 
wand in hand, looking around cautiously, when Juri smiled and lay a 
hand gently on her arm.

&quot;Welcome to Gaea,&quot; Juri said.



The two young women were sitting at a table, looking around them 
curiously. &quot;Sempai, do you really think Vash might be a woman?&quot; the 
taller, brown haired girl asked. She wore a feminine dress, and tried 
to look smaller, but it really wasn&#39;t working very well.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Milly,&quot; the shorter, dark hared woman answered. &quot;That 
was one of the rumors we heard but,&quot; Meryl sighed, &quot;I just don&#39;t 
know.&quot;

Hyatt suddenly came up from the floor beside them, and Milly nearly 
jumped out of her seat in surprise. &quot;What can I get you folks?&quot; she 
said faintly.

Both young women looked at her oddly. &quot;Do you have sundaes?&quot; Meryl 
asked.

&quot;Please,&quot; Milly chimed in.

Hyatt took the orders, fell to the floor, and snake crawled her way 
through the crowd. &quot;What kind of place is this?&quot; Meryl said, watching 
this and sweatdropping.



Juri raised her glass of wine, &quot;So what do you think?&quot;

&quot;You certainly take a girl on an interesting date,&quot; Setsuna smiled. 
They ate not far from an abandoned fortress, and nearby there was a 
small village. The residents all seemed to know Juri, keeping a 
respectful distance and offering friendly waves.

Noticing Setsuna&#39;s curious gaze Juri explained, &quot;The last time I was 
here, I helped rescue the village from a monster.&quot; She took a drink, 
&quot;To be honest, I was as bit nervous asking you out.&quot;

Setsuna raised an eyebrow, &quot;I&#39;m surprised.&quot; She raised her own glass, 
&quot;You&#39;ve certainly managed to impress me time and again.&quot;

A faint blush appeared on Juri&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiled. Juri 
paused, looking a bit uncomfortable, &quot;When you scanned me as Sailor 
Pluto, it sort of worked both ways.&quot; Setsuna looked at her oddly, and 
Juri smiled, &quot;Nothing private, but I got a sense of what you are.&quot;

Setsuna actually looked nervous, &quot;And what would that be?&quot;

&quot;The beautiful, timeless warrior of another age,&quot; Juri smiled at her. 
She grinned suddenly, &quot;How am I supposed to try and measure up to 
that?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Setsuna said, gently placing her hand on Juri&#39;s. 
&quot;You&#39;re still growing, still becoming what you&#39;ll one day be,&quot; she 
said, then she suddenly smiled as she added, &quot;Trust me, it will be 
glorious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take you word for it,&quot; Juri said. Sounding almost like a 
schoolboy, &quot;I&#39;d be honored if you&#39;d go out with me again.&quot;

Setsuna made a frustrated noise in the back of her throat, &quot;You are so 
clueless.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Juri looked startled.

Setsuna leaned across the blanket and kissed her, firmly.
