&quot;Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,&quot; a
gaggle of people sang from up on the kareoke stage,
making up for their lack of skill with enthusiasm.

&quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Jeena Malso said as she raised a
full mug with her cybernetic left arm, the muscle
shirt that the reddish brown haired woman wore
revealing rippling muscle and a well developed chest.

&quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Motoko echoed, the purple haired
woman tapped their glasses together. As a full body
cyborg it was largely pointless for her to drink, but
she did enjoy the social aspects of it.

&quot;They seemed to recognize you when we came in,&quot; Jeena
said, remembering the faint smile on the hostess&#39; face
as she welcomed them to the bar.

&quot;Which is strange,&quot; Motoko admitted, &quot;since I&#39;ve never
been here.&quot;

Arisugawa Juri fought back a smile as the orange
haired woman turned back towards the bar. It was oddly
amusing to see a woman who was so normally on the ball
like Motoko being confused, but Juri&#39;d explain the
unique nature of the bar to her eventually.

&quot;It&#39;s &#39;bout time, Juri,&quot; Haruka Tenoh said, the boyish
sandy blonde woman sitting on a stool by the main bar.

&quot;Your regular, boss?&quot; Mahoro asked cheerfully, the
black haired maid standing ready behind the bar.

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Juri nodded as Mahoro popped open a
bottle with cranberry ginger ale and poured Juri a
drink.

&quot;So,&quot; Haruka took a drink of her scotch then asked, &quot;I
understand you&#39;ve finally popped the question?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Juri smiled in a surprisingly goofy manner,
&quot;and Setsuna said yes. We&#39;ll have our ceremony in the
new year.&quot;

Haruka slapped her on the back, &quot;Congradulations.&quot; A
grin, &quot;Michiru is getting involved, and I can bet you
the other senshi are, too. It&#39;s going to be one hell
of a celebration.&quot;

&quot;Now I just have to think of how to break this to the
parents,&quot; Juri said wryly.

&quot;Not going to take it well?&quot; Haruka guessed.

&quot;My father has pretty much disowned me,&quot; Juri
admitted, &quot;but I have started talking to my mother
again.&quot; A sudden smile, &quot;I think she&#39;ll freak.&quot;

&quot;Send them a invitation,&quot; Haruka offered, &quot;if they
want to come, they&#39;ll come.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Juri nodded.

Meanwhile, a pair of new arrivals were entering the
bar. &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Alpha bowed, the
green haired android bowing slightly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the brown haired woman with glasses
smiled, her hair tied back in a bun. She was a bit
shorter than her companion, and both wore stylized
uniform body-suits.

&quot;Yayoi,&quot; her purple haired companion raised a eyebrow,
&quot;you still haven&#39;t asked how this place got ON the
station in the first place.&quot;

&quot;Ayaka,&quot; Yayoi smiled up at her, &quot;does it really
matter? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a new business that the
principal authorized.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Ayaka sounded dubious.

&quot;Would you care to have someone show you to a seat?&quot;
Alpha offered pleasantly.

&quot;Please,&quot; Yayoi took Ayaka by the arm.

&quot;Hyatt!&quot; Alpha called.

&quot;Here,&quot; a weak voice answered as Hyatt wiggled
bonelessly towards them. Both Yayoi and Ayaka
sweatdropped as Hyatt moaned, &quot;Follow me.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Ayaka murmured as they followed Hyatt
to a table.

The room, apparently some kind of converted storage
chamber was large, broken up by several loosely
defined areas. There was the main bar, of course,
where three bartenders busily served drinks, a section
of tables for dining, a library holding a variety of
media, a dance floor and finally a kareoke stage. Over
by the rear their were stairs going up, but what was
there remained a mystery.

As if it was the most normal thing in the world Hyatt
asked from the floor, &quot;Would you like to order now, or
later?&quot;

Both Ayaka and Yayoi exchanged wary looks then Yayoi
asked, &quot;Could we just get some sodas first?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; then Hyatt was off, snaking her way
through the crowds. A few moments later she delived
the drinks without spilling a drop. &quot;Call if you need
anything else,&quot; she said.

&quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Ayaka said, clearly amused.

Yayoi chuckled then leaned forward to kiss her, &quot;Merry
Christmas.&quot;

At a table not too far away, two other striking young
women sat comfortably close. One was white haired,
garbed in a simple red and black bodysuit with a white
star on her chest. Beside her a bald young woman drank
her strawberry mudslide, gold earrings glinting and
garbed in a armor-like green costume.

&quot;Is there anything else I can get you?&quot; May asked, the
buxom brown haired cyberdoll smiling at them in a
friendly way.

&quot;Thank you, we&#39;re fine,&quot; the white haired woman
smiled. As May left she turned to her companion, &quot;So
tell me about Christmas, Heather.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t ask the easy ones, Phylla,&quot; Heather
Douglas, the sometimes adventurer known as Moondragon,
smiled. The bald woman smiled slightly, &quot;It&#39;s a
holiday to exchange gifts on Earth, as well as
carrying religious significance.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like anything we had on Titan,&quot; Phylla
Vell admitted, &quot;but it does seem interesting.&quot; She
smiled fondly, &quot;It reminds me of when my mother first
gave me the Captain Marvel uniform.&quot;

&quot;I mostly just remember it from before I left Earth,&quot;
Heather conceded. She smiled at her faintly, &quot;Battling
against Thanos and adventuring hasn&#39;t given me much
time to carry out those traditions.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have anything to give you,&quot; Phylla admitted,
&quot;but...&quot; She leaned over, gently brushing her lips up
against Heather&#39;s.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Heather gently stroked Phylla&#39;s cheek, leaning
into the kiss.

&quot;You&#39;re not shocked?&quot; Phylla asked as they drew apart.

Heather laughed gently as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve been trying
to decide if I was going to have to make the first
move...&quot;

Phylla&#39;s voice was tender, &quot;I know how much Marlo
meant to you... I wasn&#39;t sure if you were still
longing for her.&quot;

Heather sighed softly, &quot;I do miss Marlo, yes, but she
was in love with someone else.&quot;

Phylla made a face at that, &quot;As much as I may like
Rick Jones, Marlo was a fool to give you up for him.&quot;

Heather managed a smile at that, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; and Phylla kissed her once again.

&quot;Isn&#39;t new love grand?&quot; Ryouko grinned as the blue
haired space pirate made up another eggnog mixture for
a customer.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Mahoro agreed as the black haired combat
android grabbed the drinks. &quot;I&#39;ll deliver these,&quot; she
said, &quot;then check up on Cyber Six.&quot;

&quot;Sasami&#39;s going to send out a rum toddy for her,&quot;
Minagi said, Ryouko&#39;s twin gracefully tossing a bottle
of beer to another customer.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Mahoro grinned, hurrying off to serve a
customer.

The tall, black haired girl looked up with her red
eyes as Mahoro delivered the drinks. &quot;Thank you,&quot;
Maggie said, moving their meal aside to help.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Mahoro grinned as she set the cups down.

Fay smiled slightly, the younger woman sitting close
to Maggie, bith enjoying the other&#39;s presence. &quot;You&#39;re
so kind,&quot; Fay smiled, &quot;I think that was the first
thing I noticed about you.&quot;

Maggie blushed, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Fay sighed happily, &quot;I&#39;m so glad I can see again... if
only to realize how cute you are, too.&quot;

Maggie, if it was possible, blushed even harder.

&quot;You look like you sound, you know,&quot; Fay rested her
head on Maggie&#39;s shoulder, &quot;strong, yet also
sensitive.&quot; A soft laugh, &quot;I just wish you hadn&#39;t
disappeared on me like that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Maggie tentatively put her arm over Fay&#39;s
shoulders, &quot;things just got kind of crazy for awhile.&quot;

Fay smiled up at Maggie blindingly, &quot;I&#39;m just glad
you&#39;re here.&quot;
