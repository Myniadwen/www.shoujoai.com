<a href="../handmaid/megaburn-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Urd scowled as the dusky skinned goddess listened to a
message from the Almighty. &quot;Why can&#39;t we help the
Knight Sabers?&quot; she asked, eyes flashing.

Belldandy put a hand on her half sister&#39;s arm, &quot;Calm
down, please.&quot; Gently the brown haired woman
continued, &quot;There must be a good reason.&quot;

The voiced echoed within them all, &quot;In the past you&#39;ve
assisted the Knight Sabers, but this is a critical
juncture for humanity. The destiny of humanity may be
decided in this test of fire, and the goddesses must
stay out, or risk bringing the demons into the fray.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; Mara conceded, the former demon smiling
grimly, &quot;if you get involved it means that Hilde can
send her forces in, too.&quot;

Urd closed her eyes, her expression pained. &quot;All
right,&quot; she bit the words out, &quot;can Skuld at least
help them? She&#39;s all ready a Knight Saber.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; it answered, then the Almighty was gone.

&quot;So,&quot; Mara sighed to the others after a few seconds,
&quot;who gets to go break the news to Sylia and the
others?&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Belldandy said and rose into the air, the
wings of her Angel Blessed Bell carrying her away from
the roof of the Silky Doll and over the city of
Megatokyo.

Belldandy took in the city, the fires of combat
burning away in parts of the city, the worst of the
damage soon becoming visible at AD Police
headquarters. With a sad sigh she opened her senses,
getting a lock on her little sister, then with a beat
of her wings was off.

The mobile Pit van was near the battlefield, the four
Hardsuits tearing into a band of corporate mercenaries
that were attacking the AD Police. Priss Asagiri
smoothly cut the enemy down with her suit&#39;s railgun,
Linna and Sylia using a more up close and personal
approach to destroy their foes. Behind them Skuld had
the hacker suit operating at peak levels, overriding
and jamming mercenary systems to give the Knight
Sabers the best advantage.

As the final mercenary suit dropped, Belldandy settled
to the ground not far away, watching cautiously as the
besieged AD Police officers emerged from hiding. Nene
Romanova ran a hand through her hair and smiled,
&quot;Thanks guys.&quot;

To a friend Sylia&#39;s voice was still recognizable,
despite the distorting effects in her suit. &quot;Glad to
help,&quot; she said then quietly added, &quot;Is everyone all
right?&quot;

&quot;One fatality and a few injuries,&quot; Nene said softly,
&quot;we lost a new recruit named Harrington, he didn&#39;t
duck fast enough.&quot;

Banishing the wings Belldandy emerged from the shadows
where she had been watching to quietly say to Nene,
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;Belldandy,&quot; Linna started only to have Nene gesture
her to silence.

Nene studied Belldandy intently for a moment before
the older woman said, &quot;You and the others aren&#39;t
allowed to help?&quot;

&quot;How did you...&quot; Belldandy blinked in surprise.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you, Urd, Skuld and Mara,&quot; Nene said
quietly, &quot;there&#39;s no way you could stand by while
people were being hurt, not unless you were forced
to.&quot;

&quot;There are other forces at work here,&quot; Belldandy said
softly, &quot;if the goddesses become involved, the demons
can, too. If so, it could tip the balance in your
enemy&#39;s favor.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Belldandy,&quot; Linna said to her lover
reassuringly, clearly tempted to go to her side but
restraining herself in front of the AD Police.

Skuld quietly asked, &quot;Big sister, does that mean I
can&#39;t help, too?&quot;

&quot;You should be fine as long as you don&#39;t use your
abilities,&quot; Belldandy said gently. Changing the
subject she looked to Nene, &quot;When I was coming here,
it looked like AD Police headquarters had been
attacked...&quot;

Nene looked like she had been gut punched. Turning
away she activated the radio in her AD Police armor,
contacting headquarters and speaking softly. Her mood
quickly leeched to the other officers nearby, the rest
looking at her with no small degree of concern.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Lisa Valente asked her, the dusky skinned
younger woman gazing at her boss with no small degree
of concern.

Nene shut her radio off, her expression grim.
&quot;Mercenary forces hit AD Police headquarters shortly
after we deployed,&quot; she said, &quot;Chief McNicol and most
of the brass are gone.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Lisa whimpered, her legs suddenly wobbly.

Priss reached out to steady the young woman even as
she looked at Nene intently, &quot;Who&#39;s in charge? We need
the AD Police together if we&#39;re going to do this.&quot;

Nene stiffened her spine, her eyes narrowing slightly
in thought. &quot;With Daley still out of town I&#39;d guess
that would be me,&quot; she said. She looked up, &quot;Skuld?&quot;

Skuld stepped up to her side, already deploying
several connector cables from the arm of her hardsuit
as she anticipated Nene&#39;s request. Plugging in to
Nene&#39;s radio and deploying the antennas on the back of
her suit she said, &quot;You want me to boost your radio so
that you can reach every other officer in the city.&quot;

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Nene smiled slightly.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Skuld wished her softly.

All across the city of Megatokyo AD Police officers
heard her voice, sounding confident and calm as she
announced, &quot;This is acting Chief Romanova, AD Police
headquarters has fallen to the mercenary forces,
repeat, headquarters has fallen to mercenaries. All
officers, desist in attempts to apprehend the
corporate suspects and devote yourselves to containing
the mercenaries, protecting civilians must be your
first priority.&quot;

&quot;Leaving us to go after the corporations behind this?&quot;
Linna murmured softly.

&quot;There&#39;s no one I&#39;d trust more to do so,&quot; Belldandy
said to her lover softly. With regret she said, &quot;I
need to go join Urd and Mara, we&#39;ll try to keep an eye
on any demonic forces that might think of
interfering.&quot;

&quot;Do whatever you can,&quot; Sylia nodded slightly then
looked over at Nene. &quot;Do you have anyone in particular
you want us to hit?&quot; she asked.

Nene was grim as she looked at the building nearby,
&quot;Bioware went into a lockdown mode as soon as we got
here, then sent the mercs out after us before we could
even ask for their surrender. Obviously, our arrival
panicked them.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;d say getting into Bioware is our first
priority,&quot; Priss said simply

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Nene sighed then she began to organize
the AD police force to move out.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and with that Sylia led the Knight Sabers
forward, the hardsuits giving them a inhuman level of
speed as they raced towards the building.

From concealed mounts weapons deployed on the surface
of the structure, lasers lashing out but the four were
just too quick. Before a second wave could start Skuld
was already at work, her suit systems jacking into
encrypted broadcasts from the building, hacking into
the computer core then shutting down the defenses.

Not waiting for a cue Priss hammered the front doors,
the reinforced alloy bending under her suit&#39;s powerful
blow. It took three punches to burst through the
durable metal, Linna joining her to pull the bent
doors aside to reveal the lobby within. Boomers looked
up, eyes glowing red, then they began to shuffle
forward towards them.

&quot;Rogue boomers?&quot; Linna looked slightly surprised, &quot;But
I thought that with the new designs they weren&#39;t going
rogue any more?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re not supposed to be,&quot; Sylia said tersely, her
suit&#39;s swords deploying. &quot;Skuld, get into a terminal,
we need to know what&#39;s going on.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Skuld raced towards the main entrance desk as
the other three began to rip into the boomers, the
pseudo-organic flesh tearing easily beneath their
blows. Deploying access cables Skuld connected to the
terminal, scrolling through directories and evading
intrusion defenses. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; she muttered softly.

&quot;What?&quot; Priss demanded, kicking out to crumple one
boomer then bringing up her cannon arm to turn the
head of another to a red mess.

&quot;They&#39;ve already created a hybridized clone, a new
Galatea,&quot; Skuld sounded grim, &quot;using DNA samples taken
from Sylia, Rei Ayanami and the original alien codes
incorporated into first generation boomers.&quot; She
scowled, &quot;I don&#39;t understand all of it, but I think
they intend to use her to trigger another full scale
boomer uprising.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot; Linna asked, the cables from her suit slicing
a boomer to ribbons even as she leapt over another
one.

&quot;As far as I can tell,&quot; Skuld looked at them
worriedly, &quot;now.&quot;</pre>
