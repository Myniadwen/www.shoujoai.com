<h1>The Sword in the Stone (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/swordstone-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Utena warily watched the young woman she, Nanami and Juri had 
carefully carried to Utena&#39;s room in the East Dorm. &#39;Thank goodness 
the old dorm had only just been re-opened,&#39; Utena thought, &#39;so there 
weren&#39;t many people she had to explain the unconscious woman to.&#39; Juri 
and Nanami stood silent nearby, looking back and forth between Utena 
and the girl.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena said quietly to Nanami, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I would 
have done if you hadn&#39;t shown up.&quot;

Nanami smiles back even as she continues to look with disbelief at the 
girl on the bed. &quot;And only in you&#39;re first week here. What are you 
going to do tomorrow, Utena-sama?&quot; Nanami teased.

Utena scowled at Nanami, who just smiled back. Utena grinned suddenly, 
answering &quot;The same thing we do every night, Nanami....&quot;

Utena and Nanami said together: &quot;Try to take over the world!&quot;

Juri looked at the two of them like they were loony, then walked over 
and very carefully, so as not to wake the unconscious girl, checked 
her pulse. &quot;Steady and strong.&quot; Juri noted to herself quietly. She 
looked measuringly at Utena. &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;

Utena shrugged. &quot;I have no idea,&quot; she said with a wry smile. She 
turned back to look at the girl, only to see brown, warm eyes gazing 
at her adoringly.

&quot;My Prince,&quot; the girl murmured as she gracefully sat up in bed. She 
smiled warmly at Utena. &quot;May I know my rescuer&#39;s name?&quot; she asked 
sweetly.

&quot;Tenjou Utena,&quot; Utena answered nervously, offering her hand to shake. 
The strange girl took Utena&#39;s hand in both of hers and smoothly 
brought it to her lips.

&quot;I am Anthy, my prince, and from this day forth I belong to you.&quot; she 
said in loving tones, and clasped Utena&#39;s hand to her chest. Utena 
looked vaguely stunned.

&quot;I think you may have competition,&quot; Nanami whispered quietly to Juri 
as they both watched the exchange of words with a great deal of 
amusement.

&quot;Can I get one?&quot; Juri quipped back to Nanami quietly, mirth in her 
voice.

Utena shot both girls a glare, and turned back to Anthy. &quot;What do you 
mean exactly, belong?&quot; Utena asked, her eyes a bit wild. The princess 
looked at her a bit perplexed.

&quot;By the terms of the spell, I must belong to the noble prince who 
releases me.&quot; Anthy smiled sweetly to a majorly sweatdropping Utena.

------------------------------------------------------------

Utena sat down for her first class of the day, placing her book bag on 
the desk. Anthy gracefully took the desk at her side, the Ohtori 
girl&#39;s uniform bringing out her dark coloring. Several students gazed 
at Anthy with no little awe. Obviously, the story of what had happened 
in the courtyard was already spreading.

Utena attempted to concentrate on her class work, but she found the 
events of the night before lingered in her thoughts. After Juri and 
Nanami had left (stopping only to get a few good quips in before they 
went), Utena had tried to explain to Anthy that she was free to go or 
to do whatever she wished. However, Anthy was simply and sweetly firm 
in that she now belonged to Utena and wasn&#39;t going anywhere. Sleeping 
arrangements were also a problem. Utena had given Anthy the bed and 
taken a sheet to the couch, but awakened in the middle of the night 
with Anthy snuggled up to her. She tried to send Anthy back to her 
bed, only to have her begin to cry softly, weeping that her prince was 
displeased with her. Of course, Utena tried to explain things, but 
finally just gave up and shared the bed with her.

Utena sighed and tried again to focus on her class work. She was 
already behind from skipping out yesterday&#39;s work. From beside her, 
she could hear fragments of several students speaking to Anthy, and 
her own cheery replies. At least she&#39;s making friends, Utena mused, 
when she heard Anthy say:

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have a boyfriend. Utena is my Prince, and I 
belong to her.&quot; Anthy was replying to a question, in what Utena had 
learned was her normally chirpy tones.

The young man gaped at her. &quot;Do you two, uhm, sleep together?&quot; the boy 
asked in very wary tones.

&quot;Of course. I first slept with Utena on the couch, then we moved over 
to the bed.&quot; Anthy explained serenely. The wide eyed young man 
sweatdropped.

From behind him, one of the female students charged him, yelled 
&quot;Hentai!&quot; and clobbered him one on the head. She smiled and nodded 
approvingly to Anthy and Utena.

Utena simply groaned and softly thumped her head on her desk. So much 
for my reputation, Utena thought wearily. I have a whole new one, now. </pre>
