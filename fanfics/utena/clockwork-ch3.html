The carriage rolled across the cobblestone path and under the raised 
caste gates. Around the small party, soldiers gazed on with a hungry 
sort of suspicion. A few rubbed their thumbs across their hilts as they 
waited for an order from their captains. But no one moved, despite the 
unfamiliar coach. Lord Saionji&#39;s men where immediately recognized by 
their insignia, even if the general himself never strayed from his 
saddle. Could they be escorting a dignitary? A prisoner? A 
slight-figured boy, in the garb of a page, rushed to meet the burly 
captain and his charges.

&quot;Ah, Sir Balus! Ah, w-who have we-?&quot;

The mustached captain gave a small huff before his raising his voice to 
be heard by those who were beginning to gather about them. &quot;Get ye off 
and call fer Master Ruka. My charges be a-growin&#39; impatient. Hurry lad!&quot; 
The boy scurried off back towards the archway looming before them, as 
the green striped knights began dismounting at Balus&#39; command. Inside 
the coach, it occupants stirred restlessly. But they didn&#39;t have long to 
wait, as a figure began to calmly stride towards them. The page boy from 
earlier scurried behind him at a respectful distance.

The lord was tall and slim, his pale skin seeming magnified by the deep 
navy tunic trimmed in a resplendent silver, peacock feathers swirling 
across in its surface in silver thread. He wore an exotic looking white 
fur vest over the tunic itself. He was taking off his crushed velvet 
bag-hat, and The White Knight could see now that his hair color was only 
a shade lighter than his dark ensemble. Ruka addressed the captain, who 
fell to one knee with his company.

&quot;Now then Sir Balus. For what reason have I been called? Surely you 
recall that today is the King&#39;s banquet for his vassals.&quot; His words were 
spoken with a charming smile, his face friendly. Balus gave a slight 
grimace knowing full well that the baron could be hard as steel when 
pushed.

&quot;A-ah my lahrd Baron. Forgive me fer disturbin&#39; yeh on this merry 
occasion. Allow me to present to yeh the most esteemed Princess Anthy 
and her knight, sir Tenjou.&quot; Figuring it best if he were to let the 
White Knight handle the negotiations of getting them inside, the men 
moved as one oiled unit to form two lines one either side of the 
carriage doors. Balus opened the door to the coach and kneeled as he 
assisted the dark skinned beauty from within. As her slippered foot 
touched the ground, Ruka blanched slightly before covering his shock 
with a smiling mask. What on earth was Anthy doing dressed like that? 
Where had she gotten such things, that was pure silk and there on the 
embroidery was gold thread! That velvet was of too high a quality to be 
anything but cut from the Tailor Guild&#39;s private stores. What was a 
slave girl doing dressed like a Queen! A &#39;Princess&#39; indeed, when the 
King found out about this there would be dire consequences. Ruka fought 
not to frown in worry. And when the King was upset...those around him 
usually found cause to become upset as well...

But with Anthy looking up at him with a patient guarded expression, so 
familiar on her visage, Ruka found himself a bit baffled. He knew of 
Anthy by sight and by reputation. And she better than anyone knew what 
the King would do. It was an open secret that she was his only sister. A 
filthy stain, the ladies of court caustically remarked, upon the King&#39;s 
lineage. And from the looks of it she was uncomfortable in what she 
wore. Unhappy to be there within the castle grounds. (Of course Ruka was 
only able to pick this out by looking at the tension in her shoulders 
and the slight crease at her eyes. Anthy wore that blank expression she 
always did.) It didn&#39;t make sense. Why all of a sudden was she...

His breath hitched at who stepped from the coach next. Mother of all the 
was Holy...it couldn&#39;t be!

A tall clanking figure bent its body and stepped forth from the coach. 
Men on the battlements raised their weapons immediately, as they trained 
them on the fearsome figure. Nearly over Ruka&#39;s height, wearing massive 
steel boots that thudded onto the powdery dirt, the White Knight 
uncurled to its full height and stared him down. His face grew even 
paler if it was possible. The navy haired man&#39;s lip trembled a touch, 
his pleasant mask crumbling.

&quot;You...y-you...By the gods, it&#39;s you!&quot; Not the most intelligent thing 
he&#39;d ever said. He&#39;d be kicking himself mentally later for sounding like 
such a simpleton. But who wouldn&#39;t stammer in shock and awe as the sun 
gleamed on that shining white armor? Who wouldn&#39;t step back in fear and 
utter admiration as that demonic face guard trained on his face. And 
those glowing blue eyes...how fascinating! His furred long-vest flapped 
heavily as Ruka fell into a low bow.

&quot;M-my lord Guardian! Forgive me, I pray thee, for not acknowledging you 
sooner!&quot; The knight remained silent, as if contemplating him. Just what 
thoughts passed behind those hellish eyes? It was like every nightmare 
and fervent religious dream come true! The Guardian...asleep for two 
thousand years...had awakened! Ruka rose from his deep bow, the soldiers 
still standing stiffly. Those who watched them from afar looked 
shell-shocked to see Ruka lower himself in front of the dangerous 
looking stranger. But crossbows were pointed up and swords resheathed. 
The castle held its breath.

&quot;I am the Baron of the Tsuchiya lands, Most Holy Swordsman. Ruka, vassal 
to the king. I had never thought in all my years to see you standing 
before me...awake!&quot; Utena was completely confused by his tone and words, 
but of course her steel mask gave no indication of this. She would have 
to ask Anthy about it. Answering him, Utena gave a slight bow in return.

&quot;It is good to be awake. But now I have come to meet with the high King 
of these lands.&quot; The man gave a grin of satisfaction at this. &quot;Ah, but 
of course you are! Please, allow me to announce you and lead you to the 
banquet hall. The King is in attendance with his court at the moment.&quot; 
He cocked his head towards Anthy, speaking over her completely in habit. 
&quot;And what of her? Will she be attending you lord?&quot; He barely had time to 
get the words out of his mouth before the massively plated knight 
stepped forward quickly. The voice that rolled from within that suit of 
armor had gone cold and dangerous.

&quot;She will not be attending anyone.&quot; The knight straightened and crossed 
its arms. Ruka hesitantly straightened as well. &quot;Tonight, before the 
king and his nobles and knights, I shall be announcing my allegiance to 
her...as well as introducing her as Princess.&quot;

Ruka&#39;s jaw dropped in shock before he could stop himself. He blinked at 
the dusky girl a minute in surprise before recovering quickly. 
&quot;I..see...&quot; The Baron was nothing if not a skilled politician. And he 
immediately let it be known where he was laying his cards.

&quot;Forgive me your Majesty. My rudeness was unforgivable.&quot; He bowed and 
kissed her hand. She smiled demurely and nodded her head, still looking 
slightly distracted. No wonder, it would seem it had been the Guardian&#39;s 
intent to come, not hers. He silently sympathized. Their meeting with 
the King...who knew what would occur? In any case, he had best get them 
inside and announce them.

Offering his arm gentlemanly to the smaller girl, Ruka smiled. &quot;Come 
then my Princess. I shall introduce you to the glittering throng 
within.&quot; His voice was a touch sarcastic, but his humor seemed restored. 
The Knight followed behind them. &quot;Let us hope our great King is in good 
spirits.&quot;

As the trio moved down the corridor, servants whispering as they passed, 
and a general buzz beginning amongst the pages, Ruka took a moment to 
look down at the woman he escorted. She really was a pretty thing, the 
hues in her skin exotic next to the red of her dress. And with her hair 
styled and cleaned, a far cry from the disheveled thing he normally saw 
lurking in the corridors, it was obvious to see she and Akio were 
related. Her face was at last exposed, and it certainly wasn&#39;t homely. 
In fact, he realized in mild amazement, she really was 
quite...beautiful. Her petite hand on his arm tightened a fraction as 
they neared the large ornate double doors. He released her and moved to 
them.

&quot;I shall enter first, and announce your presence. Good luck to you 
both.&quot; He gave a genuine smile, and replaced his hat. A small wave of 
farewell, the Baron stepped inside.

Anthy shivered as the solid door was closed by its attending guards. 
Beyond....beyond lay her fate. What would Akio do when he saw his sister 
prancing about in a- Her thoughts ceased as the knight stepped behind 
her and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. They 
cannot touch you here. I will not let them.&quot; The unseen voice reminded 
gently, and Anthy let out a small breath. She had no choice but to trust 
her Guardian. Utena was a holy relic after all. So she knew what she was 
doing...right? It took quite an effort to shove down her doubts. From 
beyond she heard Ruka&#39;s clear voice ringing out. She had always liked 
his voice. Today she wasn&#39;t so sure that still stood.

&quot;My lords and ladies. Please allow me to humbly present to you the 
lovely Princess Anthy...and the Guardian of Dios.&quot; The buzzing room fell 
dead silent as those words dropped. The guards at the door pushed them 
open with a flourish, and Anthy was suddenly being steered inside. A 
sick knot of fear twisted in her gut. But she remained outwardly calm, a 
result of practice. As they stepped in side by side, she felt Utena 
shift to walk slightly behind her. All eyes were now on them.

Before them, ranged about an enormous horseshoe table, The gleaming King 
sat with his vassals and court. Dukes, Earls, Ladies of all ranks and 
colors all ranged about in a multitude of places. Silk rustled, leather 
creaked, pearls gleamed from throats and rings as a kingdom&#39;s weight in 
gold encrusted every sitter. But for all their pomp and peacocking, the 
real attention was focused on the very highest place settings on the 
dais. There the King sat with his wife and closest company. An empty 
place setting remained, presumably Saionji&#39;s place. Utena&#39;s blue laser 
eyes rolled across the seated nobles, making them jerk with fright. They 
settled on the King before winking out. The King watched with a charming 
smile. Of all the nobles, he alone remained impassive and at ease. As if 
the two women&#39;s arrival was nothing out of the ordinary.

&quot;Well well, what have we here...&quot; The voice came from a red haired man 
sitting to Akio&#39;s right. His gleaming circlet matched the gleam in his 
eyes. Two seats down from the king, a woman with orange curls looked 
bored. Akio&#39;s lips parted in a welcoming smile as the two came to the 
fore and bowed. His eyes trained on his sister. &quot;Anthy...so you&#39;ve 
returned at last. I was quite upset when I had found you gone.&quot; His 
smile was like the sun shining, his words sweet enough to melt butter. 
Utena paused internally. The king...had not been what she had 
expected... She carefully watched those warm emerald eyes train 
themselves on her, and watched them stiffen coldly. The look quickly 
passed. Perhaps she wasn&#39;t so mistaken about him after all. The king 
inclined his head towards her, in deference.

&quot;And my eyes must misguide me. For surely this is not the deity of 
legends, the Holy Warrior of the Mountain.&quot; The tension in the room was 
suddenly thick to choke on as shock and recognition ran on every face. 
The Guardian? Surely not! Was this truly the enshrined deity standing 
before them. New eyes turned to the pair, as Utena placed a hand on 
Anthy&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;With the aide of this young woman, I have...awakened.&quot; The voice from 
the suit of armor startled many, as if they hadn&#39;t expected the thing to 
be able to speak. Several ringed hands moved to make the holy sign 
across their breasts, as whispering broke out in floods. The king lifted 
his hand and the room quieted. &quot;To what do we owe this great honor, my 
Lord Guardian?&quot;

The room waited in anticipation.

Utena&#39;s back was straight, her cloak thrown back to expose the rose 
sigil on her breastplate. Making her voice go low, to sound more like a 
man&#39;s, she answered without any hesitation.

&quot;I intend to make certain you deserve your crown. And to announce that 
Anthy will be regaining her place as Princess.&quot;

Ruka&#39;s earlier smirk when he had announced them suddenly reverted to a 
look of horror at the bluntness of that statement. The King arched an 
eyebrow but never faltered. &quot;I see...of course it is your prerogative as 
a representative of Dios. And to have my dear sister take her place 
among us...&quot; his eyes fastened onto Anthy, who took a small step towards 
her Guardian. &quot;...such a decision will be honored and respected of 
course. I&#39;m sure Anthy will receive all she is due, very soon.&quot; Those 
words had an ominous ring to them that Utena didn&#39;t like a bit. Turning 
her head slowly to capture all in her gaze, she made a quick decision 
and unsheathed her sword in a smooth movement. The sound was unlike any 
steel ever heard before. A unique ring that rolled over the ears like 
crystal, resonating through the mind. Several soldiers along the walls 
sighed dreamily.

Holding her sword out, before snapping it up in a salute, Utena 
addressed the eyes before her. &quot;I have come here to fulfill my Duty. And 
by law and decree I shall also serve my Charge. &quot; Then she dropped the 
grandstanding and pointed her sword at the table of nobles gazing back 
at her. Her voice had dropped to a deep sarcasm as she dropped the 
formality like a load of bricks. &quot;So let&#39;s all be sure to play nice. 
Anthy is under my protection, and anyone who harms her will be eating 
this sword.&quot; The blue flaming eyes seemed to go even colder, &quot;I&#39;m sure 
your green general will inform you he found that out the hard way.&quot; The 
menace in the words was clear, and Utena would have added more but she 
felt a small hand gripped her own in warning. Straightening and 
reheating her sword she folded her armored arms as the room about her 
shifted uncomfortably. The red haired man was frowning slightly in 
disapproval as he sipped from his goblet. The King&#39;s own lips were in a 
frown. &quot;But of course...Lord Knight. Surely none would dare touch my 
sister.&quot;

The room began to buzz quietly. The king and the knight stared at one 
another, sizing up the other. And Utena felt...something. Something 
nearly indefinable, like the gossamer touch of spider&#39;s silk. Then it 
was gone and the King was smiling charmingly again. His handsome tanned 
face looked carved from the most perfect of marble, smooth and flawless. 
The women below him tittered softly. &quot;Will you join us? Surely you will 
not dismiss such a grand feast, to be held in honor of our Princess?&quot;

His hand swept across the trays and platters ladened with roasted meats, 
delicacies from across the kingdom, colorful fruits coated in syrups and 
sugars, and decorative centerpieces made from platters of cheese and 
warm bread. Personally Utena didn&#39;t feel a need to eat, but thought 
perhaps Anthy would be hungry. But Anthy herself spoke, recapturing the 
attention of the room with her soft voice.

&quot;Thank your Majesty. But I think perhaps it best if we were to retire 
for now.&quot; Akio smiled tenderly at his sister, seeming for all the world 
a doting brother. But they both knew the truth.

&quot;In that case, dear Anthy, I shall have a servant escort you to your new 
apartments, and have a platter sent up later.&quot; He turned to the 
Guardian. &quot;And would you like to-&quot;

&quot;I shall agree with the Princess, and retire for now. Please enjoy your 
feast, your Majesty.&quot; The two bowed and began to leave the room as Akio 
called back to Anthy&#39;s retreating back.

&quot;Welcome home, sister.&quot;

Anthy gazed back as the door was closing behind them, just in time to 
see a wicked smile play across those cherubic lips. The door closed with 
a loud creak.

Sometime later found the emerald eyed princess in a lavish room, looking 
out a window. She was alone, the servant having left, and she felt 
caged. Her brother...there was no mistaking the malice. He hadn&#39;t liked 
seeing her there before everyone, on the arm of a deity. Not one bit. 
But he really hadn&#39;t liked the Guardian herself. Lady Tenjou really made 
an enemy...if only she hadn&#39;t challenged him outright! Anthy sighed and 
fiddled with a string on her dress. Most of all she felt tired. Tired of 
the fear and loneliness. Tired of the burning eyes that glared at her 
from behind painted smiles. The whole kingdom hated her it felt like. 
What was a witch slave doing playing such a cheap game? She half-wished 
she had never ran away in the first place. Things would be worse for her 
now.

I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve lived too long in the shadows. I don&#39;t even know how to act 
like a princess! How am I supposed to do this? Her mind agonized. 

And now Akio... She shuddered, feeling those large phantom hands move 
across her body for a moment. He scared her, not because he would kill 
her outright though. Death rarely bothered her anymore. She&#39;d tried 
enough times to kill herself after all. No...it was...the inability to 
say no around him. If he asked her, she would drop everything to come to 
him. She hated being used by him, but craved it as well. She had been 
his playmate (and the playmate of his council of advisors) for years. 
Would one day in a dress really change that? Could the Guardian really 
change that? She didn&#39;t see how.

Sighing, she rested her forehead against the glass and iron panes. The 
room felt like a cage...and she was the bird in residence. A soft rap 
came at the door, and she went to answer it. Expecting to find Utena, 
she instead stood face to face with the red haired Touga from the 
banquet hall. &quot;Hello my Princess. I wanted to greet you personally and 
welcome you back to the castle. I trust all is well?&quot; His hand slid 
slowly up the doorframe as he watched her. Eyes twinkling seductively. 
Touga was one of her...regular visitors. Anthy tensed, glancing behind 
him for her Guardian, but saw no one. Touga noticed the glance.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. Rather, I&#39;m sorry you feel 
uncomfortable around me. We&#39;ve known each other for such a long time, 
that I should think we would be friends by now.&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes narrowed 
as her blank smile came to her lips automatically. &quot;Forgive me, Lord 
Touga. I was simply curious as to the reason for you visit. Is there 
something I can help you with?&quot; 

Come on Utena...please come out to check on me...

Her secret plea surprised her. Had she come to rely on the swordswoman 
so much in such a short time? Oh if only she were as strong as her... 
Touga gave his sly knowing smile as he replied, shifting his red mane 
back over his shoulder.

&quot;Ah, I&#39;ve actually come to play messenger. King Akio was hoping to 
request a private meal with you, to catch up on this new change in 
status.&quot; His lips brushed the knuckles of her hand as he gently lifted 
it. &quot;Your brother was most concerned for your health these past two 
days-&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d be glad to. Please thank the king for his delightful invitation.&quot; 
Came a voice from the hall. The blue eyed knight was clanking 
mechanically toward them, eyes trained unblinkingly on Touga. He hid his 
small start with a rolling motion of his upper body, turning to face the 
oncoming speaker.

&quot;The Guardian! I&#39;m honored to finally meet you.&quot;

The Guardian snorted and pushed past him. Blinking in surprise he 
stumbled, and had to catch hold of the wall to keep from falling over. 
Utena leaned her armored head out around the corner and gruffly spoke, 
&quot;Well the same cannot be said.&quot; And with that the Guardian shut the door 
in the playboy&#39;s face.

Back inside the room, Utena locked the door and then removed her helm. 
Her pink hair was lightly plastered about her forehead and cheeks, so 
she brushed it away in annoyance. Anthy suddenly felt the urge to giggle 
at the disgruntled look on her face. The knight chucked her helmet into 
a chair as she plopped down into one adjacent from it and crossed her 
arms. &quot;Hmph. I don&#39;t like him.&quot; Came the simple reply as Anthy hid a 
smile. The relief she felt with having him gone was real though, as she 
moved to sit down on the bed across from her knight.

Silence passed for a time, as the knight seemed to be debating 
something. Then she spoke with a look of embarrassment and awkwardness. 
&quot;My Princess-&quot;

&quot;Anthy, Utena.&quot;

A small smile, &quot;Anthy, I was thinking that...I may need your help.&quot; 
Utena stood up, seemingly unable to sit still for long, and began pacing 
lightly. Her boots muffled on the carpeting. &quot;This world...this...this 
kingdom. It&#39;s strange to me. I didn&#39;t grow up in an era like this. 
Everything is so...so old fashioned. And there&#39;s a strict social cast 
here.&quot; The knight ran a hand on the back of her head, gazing out the 
window. She then jutted out her chin slightly and looked directly into 
Anthy&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m good at military things: tactics, fighting, 
espionage...but politics? I&#39;m awful.&quot; Anthy cocked her head to the side, 
wondering where this was going. Utena quickly answered though.

&quot;I need someone to teach me. I&#39;d like for it to be you. As long as I am 
here in this place, I need to do my best to do my job of making things 
right. But I can&#39;t do that if I don&#39;t understand how to address certain 
people the right way, or...or know just who&#39;s the people I should 
concern myself with. Do your people have guns? Have you learned to build 
advanced machinery? How technological are you? What sort of things have 
influenced you? How many kingdoms are here? Who are your allies and 
enemies?&quot;

The pinked haired woman looked frustrated. &quot;I-I just don&#39;t have the 
answers to my questions. I need someone on the inside who I can trust. 
Someone who can explain all of the inner workings of this current 
Ohtori. I don&#39;t want to...fail you in this...&quot; Her shoulders seemed to 
slump a touch, as she rested her gloved hands on the window sill. Anthy 
found herself fascinated, watching the light pouring in stream across 
that strawberry hair, outlining her pale profile. Standing and placing a 
hand on the shoulder of a creature from the greatest legends, Anthy 
found herself offering comfort.

&quot;It will be okay. I will of course help you, so long as you will help 
me.&quot; Utena looked up to find a warm smile and calm green eyes. Her lips 
twitching into a smile of her own, the tension in her back eased. &quot;Thank 
you Anthy...but I doubt you will need any help. You have already handled 
yourself well today.&quot; Utena sighed and stretched. &quot;Being in that stone 
banquet room, all those tapestries and a wooden throne...I couldn&#39;t help 
but feel that I feel asleep one day and the world passed me by.&quot; She 
chuckled, and it was a pleasant sound, &quot;I guess in a way it did.&quot; She 
jerked her head in the direction of her room as she began to head over 
toward her helm.

&quot;And by the way...there&#39;s an odd maid who seems to have an awful habit 
of helping herself into my room. She nearly broke my back jumping onto 
my arm like that.&quot; Utena sounded bemused. Anthy did giggle this time. 
&quot;Ah, I see you&#39;ve met Wakaba. She has a habit of attaching herself to 
new residents in the castle. I&#39;d be careful where I you...she has a 
skeleton key.&quot; Utena looked absolutely horrified at the suggestion, and 
Anthy smiled politely as she picked up the helm. &quot;Not to worry Sir 
Knight. I imagine wearing this to bed will deter most advances.&quot;

Utena muttered something under her breath and took back her helm. As she 
put it on, Anthy spoke. &quot;We have some time before we have to...to see my 
brother. Why don&#39;t I give you a tour of the castle.&quot; Utena nodded in 
approval. &quot;Yes, good idea. And we can dodge the maids as we go.&quot; Anthy 
laughed brightly as the two exited together.

From the corner of on wall, a figure watched them leave and pursed its 
lips. This new development had thrown a major wrench in their plans. But 
they were cunning...they would work this new factor in somehow... Taking 
note of the way the white knight kept cautiously close to its smaller 
companion, the figure slipped away and headed for a more shadowed 
corridor. This would require a bit more observation...

To Be Continued.
