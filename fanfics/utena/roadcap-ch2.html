<h1>The Road to the Capital (part 2 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/roadcap-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba squealed happily, jumping on her almost as soon 
as Utena stepped out of her and Anthy&#39;s tent.

&quot;Oop!&quot; Utena staggered, grabbing at a nearby tree branch to steady 
herself. &quot;Wakaba, you&#39;re heavy as a sack of rocks today,&quot; Utena 
gasped.

Wakaba snickered, bouncing down to stand on the ground. &quot;So is Anthy 
up yet?&quot; she asked her cheerfully.

&quot;Just getting some coffee for both of us,&quot; Utena explained. She and 
Wakaba walked over to the cooking fire, and Utena steadied two mugs as 
Wakaba filled them up. A bit of honey, and Utena returned to the tent.

&quot;No morning hair,&quot; Keiko noted admiringly as Utena walked by her.

&quot;She brushed it before stepping out,&quot; Shiori shrugged. Juri raised her 
eyebrow, and Shiori added &quot;She used to do that back in the 
mercenaries, too.&quot;

&quot;Anthy?&quot; Utena called out.

Anthy rolled over, then after a few moments sat up. Her eyes were 
heavy lidded, and her hair was sticking up randomly. She sniffed the 
air, &quot;Hmm, coffee.&quot;

Utena sat down by her on the blankets, carefully handing over the mug. 
&quot;Good morning,&quot; she smiled, kissing Anthy gently on the cheek.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy smiled, and raised her mug to sip at her coffee.

A few moments later both ladies stumbled out of the tent even as the 
process of breaking camp went on around them. Miki was in charge of 
this step, efficiently organizing the dismantling of the tents and 
making sure the troops had their breakfast.

The sun had barely rose over the hills when the merry band set out. 
The outriders rode on ahead, while Anthy&#39;s carriages and the wagons 
were surrounded by the guards. Utena rode by Anthy&#39;s door, while Juri 
and Shiori rode together on the other side.

Keiko looked oddly uncomfortable, her hawk not waiting on her 
shoulder. Miki frowned, &quot;Where&#39;s your hawk?&quot;

&quot;I sent Artemis with the outriders,&quot; Keiko glumly explained, &quot;if 
there&#39;s trouble they can release him, and he&#39;ll find me.&quot;

Miki fought a smile at the expression on her face. &quot;Thank you for your 
sacrifice,&quot; he said, sounding completely deadpan.

The brown haired young woman made a face, &quot;Thank you so much.&quot; Under 
her breath Keiko muttered, &quot;Tsuwabuki, if you hurt Artemis I&#39;ll so 
kill you.&quot;

Up with the outriders Tsuwabuki sneezed suddenly. The hawk perched on 
his arm shifted a bit, then gave him a strongly disapproving look.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Hiro asked him, his long black hair flowing around 
his head.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tsuwabuki rubbed at his nose, &quot;I guess somebody&#39;s 
talking about me.&quot;

They made good progress throughout the day, stopping for only a short 
while to eat some lunch. &quot;So what was Utena like when you first met 
her?&quot; Juri asked Shiori quietly. They were sitting together under a 
tree, eating, while Utena kept an eye on the guards. Once Juri was 
done, it would be Utena&#39;s turn to eat.

&quot;A pink haired little savage,&quot; Shiori admitted. Juri gave her a 
disbelieving look, and Shiori elaborated, &quot;She was a country girl, 
living pretty far from civilization. She rode well, and had a knack 
for the sword, but when she arrived at the camp she hadn&#39;t bathed in 
days, and all her clothes were clearly home made.&quot;

Juri looked over at the elegant, capable captain of the guard and 
shook her head, unable to imagine her looking like that. &quot;So what 
changed her?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Tarma and Kethry, mostly,&quot; Shiori smiled fondly.

Once they were on the move again, Anthy joined in on the conversation. 
&quot;What are Tarma and Kethry like?&quot; she asked. Utena listened with a 
smile, but decided to keep her mouth shut.

&quot;They were mercenary partners before they joined the Skybolts, and it 
showed,&quot; Shiori smiled. &quot;They&#39;re incredibly close, part of the same 
clan, and many in the camp assumed they were lovers,&quot; she grinned.

&quot;And were they?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;No, though that perception did create some problems for the very 
heterosexual Kethry,&quot; Shiori chuckled softly. &quot;After Utena was 
assigned to Tarma, they sort of took Utena under their wing,&quot; she 
shrugged.

&quot;Kethry taught me to read and write,&quot; Utena spoke up, her voice fond, 
&quot;and Tarma taught me how to survive.&quot; She smiled suddenly, &quot;Tarma 
always said that I was lucky and brave, and that would only take me so 
far. So, she taught me fighting and tactics.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re very fond of them,&quot; Keiko said quietly. The others started a 
bit, surprised at her sudden appearance. &quot;What?&quot; she looked around 
innocently.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Utena smiled. She looked over at Anthy, &quot;They were like 
parents to me, far better than any family I had before.&quot; An odd look 
appeared on her face.

&quot;What?&quot; Anthy looked at her worriedly.

&quot;I haven&#39;t told them about our wedding plans yet,&quot; Utena blushed 
faintly, &quot;I&#39;d better do so as soon as we reach the capital.&quot;

&quot;Get ready for some teasing,&quot; Shiori advised her, and Utena nodded 
glumly.

They hear a hawk&#39;s cry, and Artemis dropped down from the sky onto 
Keiko&#39;s arm. She unwrapped a note from his leg, reading Tsuwabuki&#39;s 
note. &quot;All&#39;s clear,&quot; she reported.

The sun was starting to slip behind the trees when they decided to 
make camp for the night. It was Wakaba&#39;s turn to cook, and the stew 
pot soon spread savory smells across the small clearing. The food was 
dished out to the guards protecting the edge of their camp, then the 
rest of them were fed.

Tsuwabuki took a careful spoon of the stew, then grinned. &quot;It&#39;s good,&quot; 
he said.

&quot;Don&#39;t sound so surprised,&quot; Wakaba suddenly loomed behind him.

Klang! Wakaba smacked him on the side of the head with her scoop.

&quot;Owee,&quot; a teary Tsuwabuki retreated to eat his meal.

Utena joined the others around the campfire, &quot;Since the embarrassing 
stories today and last night were about me, it&#39;s someone else&#39;s turn 
now.&quot;

&quot;I suppose she&#39;s right,&quot; Anthy smiled.

Shiori was about to speak up when Utena gave her a look, &quot;And we&#39;re 
not up to hearing about your sexual exploits tonight.&quot;

Shiori made a face, &quot;Darn.&quot;

Juri and Miki exchanged a glance, and Miki nodded slightly. Juri 
cleared her throat and then she took a small drink, &quot;Back when Miki 
and I were in the guards together, we had a few interesting 
adventures.&quot; Once she saw she had all of their attentions, she 
continued, &quot;It was just after we finished our training...&quot;
