<h1>Just Like Clockwork (part 5 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/clockwork-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Thorns 


Giving a cough, Utena grasped at her throat, gloved fingers moving 
underneath the rim of her helm. The uncomfortable choking sensation 
didn&#39;t go away, as she stared down at the green haired man across from 
her. He too looked discomforted, but not overly so. Forcing herself to 
straighten, Utena stood to her full height. She would not lose to this 
man...

Anthy was watching the two duelists, with mixed feelings of worry and 
anticipation. Lady Utena didn&#39;t know what she was getting into...when 
she had probed her mind earlier, very subtly of course, there had been 
an alien feeling to it. From what surface emotions and thoughts she 
could glean, Utena didn&#39;t even know what magik was!

How can anyone go through life and not know the basics of the primal 
energies that move beneath our physical plane? Even a peasant knows a 
simple charm or two...just what sort of world did she grow up on?

This was not good...especially since a Duel, invoked on the Rose Grounds 
was a magik as old and as bloody as the forming of the world itself...

She and Touga looked at each other across the space between them. They 
shared a thought and looked away. Neither one&#39;s friend understood what 
they were getting into...

Anthy sighed and straightened her spine. She moved to pluck a pair of 
roses from the garden, and handed one to Touga as he came to meet her. 
Separating, they continued the ritual by holding the bloom up to the 
chest of their respective duelist. The rose remained poise above their 
hearts, as Anthy spoke the words to her Guardian.

&quot;With this rose, a solemn vow is struck: Neither of you shall walk away 
from this fight, until a rose has been cut off. To be forsworn is to 
die. May the light of Dios be your guidance.&quot;

Touga carefully held up the rose in his hand to Saionji&#39;s breastplate. 
Thorny tendrils emerged and slowly began to curl down into a point. With 
a quick jab, Touga plunged the rose by its stem into the armored chest, 
making Saionji gasp. The man&#39;s back bowed as if a sword were being 
plunged deeply into him. Utena was shocked. The rose stems had pierced 
the plate mail as easily as if it were made of tissue paper! What was 
this? Some kind of trickery? An illusion? She took a hesitant step back, 
eyes wide.

Saionji took a painful gasp of breath into his lungs and relaxed. Touga 
had been cradling him with one hand, helping him to regain his balance. 
When the general was once more on his feet, he shot a smirk of 
confidence at where Utena stood behind Anthy. His rose was glowing a 
soft pulsating green.

Utena looked down at Anthy, who held a rose before her. Suddenly she was 
beginning to have serious doubts about going along with this... Too many 
weird things were happening.

&quot;Wait...are you....going to do that to me as well?&quot; At Anthy&#39;s nod Utena 
gave a small bewildered shake of her head. &quot;B-But this is...I don&#39;t 
understand! The fight doesn&#39;t end until one of our roses is cut? But 
that means death, right? Another phrase for killing someone?&quot; She looked 
back to see the glowing green rose on Saionji&#39;s chest. It was positioned 
in the middle of his armor, slightly to the left. Exactly where his 
heart would be. But a cut to the rose might be equally solved with a 
stab through the rose. Was this really a fight to the death after all?

Anthy looked up at her protector with obvious worry. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...but 
there&#39;s no real time to explain. You just need to cut off his rose. Then 
the magik circle will be let down around the dueling area, allowing us 
to leave.&quot;

&quot;Magic circle? What circle? Is this some kind of joke? Just a moment 
Anthy, I don&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;What are you two doing whispering over there! Are you having second 
thoughts, knave!&quot;

Utena turned and snarled back in his direction. There was a tightening 
at her throat, making her cough out loud again. She couldn&#39;t breath! 
W-what was this! What was going on, something was choking her! A wave of 
dizziness passed over her, her eye scanners blipped on and off once, her 
vision wavering. It hurt...god it hurt...what the hell was going on with 
her? Falling to her knees, she looked up to see Anthy holding her by the 
shoulders. Her face was deadly serious.

&quot;You must accept the rose! You have been challenged and cannot walk 
away! The arena won&#39;t let you. It will kill you Utena! Please...just 
trust me!&quot;

Utena looked up to see Anthy biting her lip, holding the rose at her 
side limply. Closing her eyes, suddenly lost in confusion within a world 
with things that seemed impossible...Utena gave a small shake of her 
head. &quot;Yes...then please...give me my rose.&quot;

Anthy cradled an arm behind Utena&#39;s back, leaning over the now shorter 
knight. Holding the rose, she whispered a strange prayer under her 
breath. It was an alien tongue, the cyborg&#39;s memory banks couldn&#39;t 
identify. Holding up the rose, the stem began to grow spidery tendrils 
just as Saionji&#39;s had done. Utena&#39;s eyes locked onto the very sharp 
thorns that grew like black teeth all across the curling shoots. They 
twisted into a sort of blade, almost like a knife or a pike. Rearing her 
arm back, Anthy gave Utena a look of sympathy. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...but this 
will hurt...&quot; And with a speed that surprised the mechanical woman, the 
princess plunged down her hand.

Utena watched as her world slowed to a creeping halt. It was as if her 
vision had crystallized watching that falling hand...that rose tight in 
its fist... In slow motion, her glowing blue eyes tracked that spike of 
thorns as it just pierced her chest. In wonder she saw the plate that 
protected her mechanical suit&#39;s core splinter apart and allow access. 
Then the world sped up with a blinding crash.

Clenching her teeth against a howl of pain, Utena let out a mangled 
grunt as the rose stem slammed deeply into her heart. Anthy held her 
tightly, but Utena could see nothing...hear nothing...she was lost in a 
world of pain. She gave a small shiver of agony, as she felt those 
thorns split apart and wrap tightly about her mechanical clicking heart. 
Like a cocoon...or maybe a bug caught in a spider&#39;s web. Those vines 
squeezed ever so slightly, like a warning of things to come if she 
didn&#39;t behave, and Utena&#39;s vision blacked out again. She gasped out a 
breath, feeling her inner motors try to prevent her from 
hyperventilating. At last the pain ebbed away, as the thorns relaxed.

&quot;...ou...jou...Sir Tenjou! Can you hear me!&quot;

Slowly the receptors in her eyes crackled back to life. Her vision 
clicked through several heat and night filters before her world restored 
itself in color again. Anthy was holding both sides of her face guard, 
looking worried. Apparently she had been calling her name for quite some 
time.

Shaking her head to try and clear it, Utena got unsteadily to her feet. 
Saionji had his arms crossed, his face one of cruel amusement.

&quot;My goodness, are you alright, oh holy knight? You don&#39;t look so good!&quot; 
Utena looked over at him, but dismissed the insult. She was far too 
distracted looking at the rose sprouting from her chest. It 
looked...weird. There was no other word for it. Some organic plant thing 
was sticking out of her chest, and putting the Jaws of Life onto her 
heart. Fantastic. This was already off to a wonderful start. Giving an 
experimental poke at it, with one of her gloved fingers, the rose began 
flickering to life. It was glowing white, as if someone had decided to 
stick a battery in it. Yes...weird was one word for it...

&quot;...So Beautiful...&quot;

Well no, that wasn&#39;t what she would-Utena&#39;s staggered thoughts focused. 
That wasn&#39;t her thoughts. She looked down to see Anthy hesitantly 
reaching out as if to touch the glowing blossom. Her face held a soft 
wonderment. Utena was baffled. But before she could think of a thing to 
say, Saionji was already striding across the field.

&quot;Enough of these games, I came to fight! Ready your sword, you stupid 
clunking beast. I&#39;m going to turn you into a scrap heap!&quot;

Utena pushed Anthy back out of the way and smoothly readied her sword. 
&quot;Then come on you grunting pig. I&#39;m tired of waiting to beat you.&quot; Her 
brazen words made his face contort with rage. Picking up speed into a 
run, Saionji raised his sword and charged. Leaping forward into a lunge, 
his sword swung down viciously.

Utena sidestepped, catching the blade with her guard. The two began 
swinging at one another, parrying and attacking with the ringing sound 
of steel on steel. From the balconies and windows, the residents of the 
castle had hurried to come and watch. The news of the progressing duel 
had already swept through the servants like wildfire.

There were other knights watching on the field, forming a semi circle 
well outside of the fighters&#39; way. They were talking in low whispers, 
pointing gloved hands at one or the other. Utena gave a grunt as Saionji 
launched a kick into her gut, but she held onto it, and twisted to knock 
him off balance. He hit the ground and she darted in forward with a 
nasty cut. But the green haired man rolled backwards to avoid it. Coming 
up into a crouch he shot forward again with another slash. Sparks 
exploded alongside her rose, as she twisted her torso to protect it. But 
then she winced as she felt a pain lance through her. Daring a quick 
glance down, she saw that some of the petals had been singed. Her eyes 
widened at the implications as she parried another strike.

She drove her fist into Saionji&#39;s cheek, feeling a grim smile as he gave 
an &#39;oof&#39; of surprised pain. He wasn&#39;t the only one who could play dirty. 
Anthy was calling to her from the sidelines.

&quot;His rose! Go for the rose!&quot;

Utena locked her gaze onto the target, coming to an understanding. If 
her rose hurt...then his would too...it would be best to finish this 
fight as quickly as possible. His speed was no match for hers... she 
thought determinedly as she sent her blade singing through the air 
toward the glowing petals. But it was avoided by a clever twist of his 
hips and a rotation of his sword guard. Dodging, he pressed into the 
attack, driving her back.

Saionji moved with a grace that surprised her, she had to admit. He 
hadn&#39;t been like this when she had first fought him in the cave.

Saionji seemed to read her thoughts, as he spoke between pants. &quot;I-I&#39;m 
not...some amateur... You...you got the drop on me before...b-but I&#39;m 
not going to lose again!&quot;

His brow was slick with sweat that kept pouring down into his eyes. He 
had tied his long foamy hair back into a high ponytail at the start of 
the duel, but strands had come loose and were plastered to his cheeks 
and neck.

The sun was beating down on them, making Utena uncomfortable in her 
ecto-plating. She was starting to feel exertion, which was shocking in 
of itself. This man really was giving her a good fight...when was the 
last time she had actually experienced one? Not since before her 
cryo-sleep...that a mere human could keep up with her enhancements only 
showed how strong the world had become since her time. She was starting 
to grin.

&quot;You&#39;re not bad, green boy. But I&#39;m better...&quot;

Saionji grunted at that and shoved her back. Swinging his sword back, he 
aimed for the rose on her chest as he let lose a howl of anger. Utena 
watched the sword fall, and closed her eyes. Her arm moved of its own 
accord, coming up into a smooth arc, racing for his chest. The world 
fell to silence, as the crowd watched with tension. The blades sped past 
each other, grazing only briefly, each flying towards their mark...

Anthy had her hands clasped tightly in front of her heart, her face 
dissolved in concern and fear. From this angle, she couldn&#39;t see! Who 
would win this duel? Touga was watching from his place, his eyes 
tracking the footfalls of the two duelists like a raptor.

There was a loud shriek as swords bit into metal, and then a silent 
explosion of power blew back the two fighters. Utena landed on her back 
some ten feet away, hard enough to send the wind rushing from her lungs. 
She gave a gasping cry, gloved fingers blindly fumbling about her chest 
for her rose. Saionji landed on his side, curled protectively about his 
dropped sword. He didn&#39;t stir...

Where they had been not moments before...the still glowing petals of 
Saionji&#39;s rose slowly drifted down to the ground. One petal floated 
across to where Utena lay, shimmering as it landed onto her rose. The 
green petal was absorbed, her white rose curling up and around it like a 
Venus flytrap. Utena felt the earth beneath her body quake, and watched 
the sky above her faintly shimmer. Was it her imagination...or had there 
been force field dome of some sort covering them the entire time? But 
her thoughts ground out as she hissed in pain. The thorns that had sunk 
and intertwined with her mechanical gears and wiring uncoiled and 
withdrew. The rose on her chest turned ashen and fell off of her. Her 
chest plate was whole once more.

Lying on her back, staring up at the sky, the castle rose tall above her 
vision. From this angle it was upside down... Something was odd 
though...not just the duel. That would be something she would be 
replying and analyzing for quite awhile that night. No...her thoughts 
felt fuzzy after the recent loss of her adrenaline high...but something 
about her eyes sight was prickling at the back of her mind...

The face of Anthy entered her vision, looming above her. She looked torn 
between relief and worry.

&quot;A-ah...err...Sir Tenjou...&quot;

Utena groaned and closed her eyes. She was feeling a head ache come on. 
She must have knocked a few sensory wires loose some time during the 
duel. The dull pain was throbbing at her temples. &quot;Please help me to 
stand, Princess.&quot; She sighed tiredly.

&quot;A-ah...but...err...&quot; She bit her lip, clearly worried about something. 
But she bit her lip and helped the aching knight to stand. Utena was 
smiling softly to herself. That had actually been....fun. Strange, but 
fun.

Touga had gone to check on his fallen comrade, before a pair of muscular 
servants had come up bearing a stretcher along their shoulders. They 
helped the black knight onto it, before hefting him away. The red haired 
noble stood, and brushed off his hands. Flicking his long hair over his 
shoulder, he turned and began to walk towards the two women. As he 
walked closer, his face flitted from surprise to interest. There was a 
sly smile on his lips as he met them.

&quot;Well it would appear the victor is clear here, Holy Guardian.&quot; Utena 
raised an eyebrow at his smile. What was the fool grinning about now?

&quot;A-ah, Guardian...you&#39;re...&quot;

Utena looked down at Anthy who was staring at her as well. Utena gave an 
exasperated sigh. &quot;What is it? Just say it, Princess!&quot; Utena massaged 
the side of her head, trying to locate the source of the ache.

Wait...

......her head?

Utena felt about her face, realizing her helm was gone. Touga&#39;s grin 
grew even larger as he bent down to pick up something. It was her helm, 
split in two. Saionji&#39;s blade had cleaved it during the last exchange. 
Utena felt the color drain from her face. 

Oh dear...

The excited whispers from the people in the windows and courtyard and 
grown in volume, gaping as the Holy Knight stood for all to see. Her 
long pink hair was hanging loose and free about her shoulders. Touga 
smiled warmly as he handed her her helm.

&quot;Oh my...I must admit I&#39;m quite surprised! That such a powerful deity as 
yourself would be a woman...and an exquisite one at that!... why I 
hardly thought it possible!&quot;

Utena flushed in embarrassment, feeling all eyes on her. 

Damn it! So much for undercover work...Utena you idiot! She berated 
herself mentally.

Glaring at him coolly, she snatched her helmet from his hands and pushed 
past him. Touga didn&#39;t seem put-off by this in the slightest, and he 
chuckled in open amusement as she strode away, Anthy trailing at her 
side.

&quot;Congratulations on your victory, my lady! Surely none will doubt your 
ability to fight now.&quot;

Utena growled and twisted to look back at him as she headed back for the 
castle. &quot;My mission hasn&#39;t changed! I still intend to evaluate your 
kingdom! So you better watch out, Kiryuu!&quot; Servants hastened to push 
open a side door, as her mood darkened in annoyance to the Kiryuu 
clansman&#39;s bright laughter. She quickly ushered Anthy through the 
portal. The two women escaped to safety, heading back to their 
apartments.

Touga bent to pick up the withered white rose, his smile still etched 
across his face. Bringing it to his lips, he stared at the now closed 
door. The spectators were slowly leaving.

&quot;Yes my dear lady knight...and I look forward to it...&quot;

It wasn&#39;t hiding. Not really. It was just...regrouping in private. At 
least that&#39;s what Utena was trying to convince herself, as she opted to 
avoid going to dinner in the great hall yet again. In favor of their 
meal being brought to Anthy&#39;s rooms.

Mentally she berated herself. Anthy should be down there, sitting at her 
brother&#39;s side. Instead, she was here, with her...eating quietly while 
Utena sulked. The cyborg felt badly for it. Anthy was only here, because 
Utena was. The dark skinned woman probably felt obligated to offer her 
company. Utena herself felt guilty, because she felt the better for 
having it. She was supposed to be the big bad Guardian right? A &#39;deity&#39; 
Touga had called her? So why the hell was she hiding out in her 
Princess&#39; rooms! Pathetic.

Utena sighed, and ran fingertips over her split helmet. She wouldn&#39;t be 
able to wear it again, until she had it repaired. But that hardly 
mattered now, right? The whole kingdom was buzzing with the news. She 
had heard the servants whispering in the halls, her improved hearing 
easily picking up the words. News of her gender and appearance was the 
subject of every conversation. And some of the things said 
were...embarrassing.

Really now...she didn&#39;t see why being a woman had to be such a big deal 
here. Back home it didn&#39;t make that much of a difference. Not really...

Utena sighed again, letting the helmet fall softly to the carpet at her 
feet. She was currently sitting in a chair, facing slightly towards the 
window. Her head was buzzing with plans and ways to counter the negative 
reaction the recent duel would bring to her Princesses&#39; reputation, when 
she felt Anthy stir behind her. A hand came to rest along her shoulder 
guard. Utena closed her eyes briefly as Anthy&#39;s low words came from just 
behind her ear.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised. I would have thought you would have asked a million 
questions by now.&quot;

Utena gave a small chuckle and leaned her head back on her chair. She 
spoke without looking. &quot;Well...I haven&#39;t really digested everything 
yet...&quot;

She opened her eyes to find that Anthy had moved to her side. Regarding 
her carefully with intelligent green eyes. Utena looked away. To admit 
she knew nothing about...whatever it was that had been going down there 
on the field of roses...Magic...tricks...whatever... It&#39;d be admitting 
ignorance to a lot of things. And it made her feel stupid. She hated 
that...especially remembering how weak she had felt, as Anthy raised 
that rose above her head to stab her heart.

The cyborg winced in memory, and closed her eyes again. Unconsciously, 
her fingers brushed over her breastplate, where the rose had been hours 
before.

Anthy&#39;s fingers met hers, causing her to open her eyes in surprise. 
Looking up, she found the Princess leaning closer. Utena blinked, seeing 
a play of unknown emotions across that smooth, unlined face. She felt 
her heartbeat quicken as Anthy entwined her smaller fingers among 
Utena&#39;s own. Pulling her hand away from her chest, still watching 
Utena&#39;s face for a reaction, she turned the pale hand over to reveal the 
palm. Utena swallowed slightly, wondering why the air in the room 
suddenly felt so thick.

&quot;Did you cut your hand on the helm, when you took it forcefully from 
Lord Kiryuu?&quot;

Utena felt her cheeks flush slightly, as she huffed. She wished 
desperately for her helm then. For its expressionless face, and its 
shielding mask. It made it harder to lie with a straight face, when she 
didn&#39;t have it. &quot;I...may have gotten careless. It probably came from the 
fight or something though. Er, but it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t hurt 
anyway...&quot;

Anthy arched an eyebrow and raised the palm up a little higher. She 
turned her eyes away to look down at it. &quot;You seem to have a bit of a 
temper, Sir Tenjou...&quot; Utena huffed in defeat and looked away.

The cyborg felt the Princess trace a finger delicately around a gash 
that arced across her palm. She had kept it covered earlier, when they 
had first headed for their rooms. But now the wound had stopped bleeding 
and was exposed. Her glove would need to be sewn up again as well. Utena 
added it to the long list of things she had to do.

&quot;You should get this looked at. You wouldn&#39;t want a scar, now would 
you?&quot;

Feeling the smile behind those words made the pink haired knight smile 
as well. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be my first. And I doubt it would be my last.&quot;

Anthy tsked quietly as she inspected the wound with a trained eye. &quot;You 
can be hasty sometimes. You shouldn&#39;t let Kiryuu get to you so easily.&quot; 
Utena snorted at that as she inspected the other glove she was still 
wearing. &quot;Who cares about that red haired hyena anyway?&quot;

Anthy released her hand and moved near the bed to pull hanging silk 
cord. A bell rang somewhere outside the door, signaling for a servant. 
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I know what a &#39;hyena&#39; is...but I&#39;m certain it would 
describe Lord Kiryuu well. Did you have any questions, now that the duel 
is over?&quot;

Utena looked up at her charge, and frowned in thought. &quot;...I...did have 
a few questions I suppose. Although it will probably make me seem odd or 
stupid...&quot; Utena trailed off uncomfortably. Anthy gave her a reassuring 
smile. &quot;Oh not at all. I would be happy to help the Guardian anyway I 
could.&quot; But a knock interrupted them.

A moment later, a servant girl came in, cheerfully smiling as she 
curtseyed.

A very...familiar servant girl...

With a quickness that was startling, she was already darting across the 
room and slinging arms around one of Utena&#39;s own. Wakaba the servant 
girl was hungrily feasting upon finally seeing the Guardian &#39;unmasked&#39; 
as it were. She moved around this way and that, to openly take in the 
full effect of the pink haired woman seated there. Wakaba clasped her 
hands together in admiration. &quot;So it is true! The great Guardian who 
serves as Dios&#39; avatar...the deity come down to judge us, is female! So 
incredible! And you beat our finest general so easily too...amazing!&quot; 
Batting big brown eyes up at the uncomfortable knight, she pressed her 
body in close.

&quot;Oh my Lord Guardian...or would that be Lady now? I&#39;m so glad to see you 
unharmed! That duel in the gardens was so frightening! All of the 
servants were worried for you! But you of course looked soooo dashing 
fighting against that mean old General Saionji...&quot; Utena&#39;s eye twitched 
as Wakaba leaned in even closer. This woman was so...unsettling...

Anthy was hiding her face behind her hand. But the crinkle of amusement 
at the corners of her eyes gave her away. Utena scowled at her and 
decided to end the foolishness. &quot;Alright, that&#39;s quite enough. Thank 
you. Now please...if you&#39;ll release my arm now?&quot; Wakaba pouted but did 
as she was told. Utena stood up from the chair as Anthy took over. 
&quot;Wakaba? Will you please go and draw a hot bath for the Guardian? And 
see to it she is washed?&quot; Utena looked up at her with shock.

&quot;A bath? B-but why do I need to-&quot;

&quot;Because you smell Utena, dear.&quot;

&quot;I-I do not! I am incapable of emitting any sort of-&quot;

&quot;And besides, you&#39;ve been in that armor since you&#39;ve awoken. Surely you 
would feel much more comfortable out of it.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes! And I&#39;ll help you!&quot; &lt;3

&quot;W-wait now! Stop tugging my wrist, I&#39;m perfectly capable of washing 
myself, thank you!&quot;

&quot;Oh...then I suppose you feel upset about me intruding in your affairs, 
Guardian...&quot; Anthy looked crestfallen, and guilty about having made 
plans without Utena&#39;s consent. Utena felt torn. Anthy&#39;s face when she 
was upset nearly broke her heart. Hastily, she tried to smooth over the 
situation for the sake of her Princess. &quot;Ah, well no...it&#39;s not that. 
I&#39;m touched by your concern. You needn&#39;t worry about one such as I, 
since you are a Princess of high standing...&quot; Utena ran her fingers 
through her hair. &quot;If you will be alright here, I will go then...&quot;

Anthy smiled cheerfully. &quot;Oh no. I&#39;ll be coming along as well!&quot; Utena 
blanched. &quot;W-what! Why on earth would you want to-&quot; She was silenced as 
Anthy patted her hand calmly and the two women each took an arm. Leading 
the unwilling knight out of the doorway and to her quarters, Anthy 
explained calmly.

&quot;Well you said you had questions to ask, and I imagine they are of a 
serious nature. There&#39;s no sense in putting them off, as I&#39;m certain you 
will be very busy later with your duties as a Guardian. Besides, we are 
all women, are we not? It&#39;s not the same as if you were a male. So no 
need to be embarrassed.&quot;

Utena was completely overwhelmed by the domineering attitude of both of 
the women leading her into her room. How did the situation turn out like 
this! Anthy gave a small bashful laugh.

&quot;And I must admit to being curious to seeing what you look like outside 
of that rather imposing suit of armor.&quot;

&quot;Oh my, Princess. You are so comfortable speaking with the Holy 
Guardian! It must be the confidence of the aristocracy.&quot;

&quot;As are you, dear Wakaba. Are not the servants generally superstitious?&quot; 
Utena was being led into the room, where a large inset bathtub had been 
uncovered. Servants were coming in with steaming buckets of water and 
fresh cakes of soap, filling it with clean scented bathwater. The knight 
sighed. &quot;You two are really too much...I don&#39;t need an audience you 
know, its just a bath.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Anthy responded, pulling up a seat to face the side of the 
tub. Utena hung her head in defeat. When the servants had left, Wakaba 
held out her hands to Utena, to remove the red cape from her armor. 
Anthy explained. &quot;All high ranking officials are expected to be tended 
to. It is the luxury of our station. And as someone with so much 
political and religious clout behind you, it is even more expected that 
you be tended to by your servants. It shows a distinction you 
see...although I suppose neither of us are very used to it yet...&quot;

Anthy looked down at her hands in her lap, as Wakaba carefully folded up 
the cape and set it aside on a waiting chair. She had adopted a near 
business-like attitude, Utena noted, now that she was doing her job. 
Wakaba was now trying to find the seams in the suit of armor, in order 
to help remove them. But strangely...the girl could find no seams 
whatsoever...

Moving this way and that, bending over sometimes as she scanned the 
armor, Wakaba could find no place where the armor came apart. It was as 
if it were a decorated cast of the human body...with the Guardian welded 
completely inside! Seeing Wakaba&#39;s confusion, Utena stepped back with a 
gentle smile.

&quot;Please, allow me...only I can remove it.&quot; Turning her back, to face 
away from the two women out of modesty, Utena pressed a series of codes 
into petals of the rose symbol on her chest. A loud whirring sound 
filled the room, startling the other two women. Threads of red light 
began criss-crossing in a complicated web across the mechanical knight&#39;s 
body, interlacing around the rose symbol. With a hiss of steam and 
hydraulics, the suit split open in the front, allowing Utena to climb 
bodily out of it. She was a good head and a half shorter now. The steam 
ghosted out along the floor, obscuring the woman who had climbed out of 
the suit.

To Anthy&#39;s nose it smelled like...lightning...a scent of something like 
ozone, coming from the fog. When the steam had dissipated enough, they 
could clearly see the figure of a slender young woman, garbed in strange 
men&#39;s clothing. It was some sort of uniform...looking very crisp and 
military. She wore a long sleeved buttoned top, with various insignia 
and patches on the front pocket and sleeves. Her pants where a tan with 
a black stripe, tucked into knee-high black leather boots. Her top was 
black as well, with tan trim. On her right shoulder, was the symbol of a 
rose in red embroidery. Clearly, Dios&#39; symbol. It matched the rose on 
her belt, which ran down across her torso at an angle.

Seeing her like that, both women were struck by how commanding and 
confident she looked. With her chin held high, almost defiantly, she 
seemed almost masculine, despite her slender build, and feminine 
qualities. The uniform made her innocent cherubic face look harsher. She 
truly looked the part of a Guardian.

But as Wakaba and Anthy stared in awe, the spell was broken as Utena 
scratched the back of her head in shy discomfort.

&quot;Do I....really smell bad?&quot;

Wakaba shook her head and bounced over to help the woman. Her brown 
poyntail bobbed with her excitement. The suit of armor remained standing 
where it was, like a giant metal egg. &quot;Come come, Lady Guardian! We&#39;ll 
have you relaxed and comfortable in no time. Oh dear! What did you do to 
your hand? Oh this is no good at all, we&#39;ll need to get this sewn. Oh 
hear, let me undo that.&quot;

Having finally figured out how Utena&#39;s uniform was put together, Wakaba 
began undoing the buttons at the top, and tugging off her boots. Outside 
of her suit, Utena seemed a little less sure of herself, Anthy noted. 
Like a horseman who has spent too much time on his steed, and must 
regain his legs.

Utena also looked very cute when she blushed.

&quot;Oh please, you act as if you&#39;ve never had another woman undress you 
before.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Wakaba said, grasping onto Utena&#39;s shoulders. Her eyes looked 
up in sympathy. &quot;Heaven must be very lonely, Holy One...&quot;

&quot;I-I&#39;m not a god! Oh, for the love of the Abraxas Corps, 
please...just...call me Utena, alright? All of this &#39;Holy One&#39; talk and 
&#39;Lord Guardian&#39; business...it&#39;s...not necessary you know.&quot;

Utena was helped out of her jacket, and was standing clad only in her 
undershirt and pants. The blush still tinged her cheeks as Wakaba tugged 
insistently at her pants. Finally the poor knight had had enough.

&quot;Look, I can do this part myself alright? Turn around please.&quot; Wakaba 
crossed her arms defiantly but turned around when Anthy inclined her 
head. With their backs turned, Utena gingerly shed the last of her 
clothes and got into the soapy scented waters of the bath. It was still 
very hot, but her body temperature was quickly adjusted by the machines 
grafted into her very veins. When she was safely in the water up to her 
neck, back turned to the other two, Utena mumbled something under her 
breath that sounded like, &#39;You can turn around now&#39;. Hiding a smile, 
Anthy did so. Wakaba however had already reached for the soap and the 
bowl of shampoo.

In an attempt to keep Utena&#39;s mind off of Wakaba (who was enjoying 
herself rather too much ) Anthy began to question the Guardian.

&quot;So tell me...what would you like to know?&quot;

Utena paused as she scooped some suds from her left eye and called back 
over her shoulder. &quot; At the arena...something....something happened. It 
was strange. My sensors couldn&#39;t pick up anything, but I felt it. And 
that thing with the glowing rose...and that force field over the 
gardens. Was all that....magic?&quot; She sounded a bit skeptical. Anthy gave 
a nod. But then realizing she couldn&#39;t see it, answered aloud.

&quot;Yes. Magik. The force behind all things. What you felt was the contract 
being formed between you and your opponent, and then your contract with 
the dueling arena itself. It&#39;s a power that can come in many forms...and 
there are those who are more proficient in its uses than others...&quot;

&quot;...Huh...I see. Is that how this world works...&quot;

Anthy cocked her head lightly to the side. Wakaba was finally calming 
down, and had begun to carefully scrub at the pale skin of her mistress. 
Utena had relaxed finally, and was resting her head back on the edge of 
the tub. Anthy spoke hesitatingly; concerned she might offend the 
powerful woman.

&quot;You...didn&#39;t have magik in your world.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. Wakaba, 
although she never slowed in her menstruations, had pricked her ears at 
their conversation. Utena paused a moment before speaking.

&quot;...No. We didn&#39;t.&quot; There was silence after that. Only penetrated by the 
sounds of the servant girl scrubbing at Utena&#39;s pale shoulders, and 
rinsing them with the rose scented bath water.

Anthy licked her lips to wet them, before asking softly. &quot;Would...tell 
me a bit more about your world?&quot; Wakaba gave an eager nod, then realized 
what she was doing and stopped. Utena was quiet, staring at her hand. It 
rested on the edge of the bathtub, facing her.

&quot;My world is so different. I simply...couldn&#39;t describe it all in a day, 
Princess.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;I suppose, you are having similar problems 
explaining to me about your world, yes?&quot; Anthy said nothing but smiled, 
waiting for the woman to continue. She liked the way that low smooth 
voice moved up and down in tone as Utena spoke. It was soothing.

&quot;At the time...there was a ruling family in our country. They were very 
upright military, advocating the values of strength and dignity. Under 
their guidance, our country was constantly at war with its neighbors, 
fighting over dwindling resources and shrinking land. There were...just 
too many people... And with all the pollution and disease sprouting up, 
there was no choice but war.&quot;

Utena sighed tiredly. &quot; Over 11 million people died instantly, when one 
of our enemies released a bio weapon over our main capitol.&quot; Turning her 
head to see Anthy&#39;s and Wakaba&#39;s expressions, she explained further. 
&quot;That&#39;s...like...a magik disease I&#39;d guess you&#39;d say...created to target 
a certain type of people. An airborne plague.&quot;

&quot;And people...released such a thing...on purpose!&quot; Anthy was shocked. 
The very idea of someone like her brother or their enemies getting ahold 
of such a thing...and using it...was sickening.

Utena chuckled again, but it was sarcastic. &quot;Yes...amazing what people 
will do, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She leaned her head back again and closed her eyes. 
&quot;When that happened...not only did people die...but it was designed to 
make men infertile. To kill children...before they were even born. It 
was a bold move, and it severely weakened our country. So we had to seek 
other methods of having children. That&#39;s when the Abraxas Corporation 
was born. It handled both medical and military affairs. From it, several 
branches of research and study formed.&quot;

Utena sat up a little straighter as Wakaba switched sides. Her hair now 
hung in damp, dark pink coils along her back and chest, framing her 
face.

&quot;So...what did your country do when this happened? Surely they 
retaliated...&quot; The images that came from the otherworldly being&#39;s words 
were...astounding! Those people two thousand years ago were able to do 
things that would amaze even their best mages! Bearing children without 
a man and a woman...creating suits of armor that could withstand an 
assault from normal steel...and...creating Utena...

Utena herself was lost in thought for a moment, remembering. She felt a 
pang in her chest, somewhere in her heart. She missed her home...it was 
awful and war torn but...he had been there...

&quot;He?&quot;

Utena realized with a start she had said that last part out loud. 
Embarrassed, she found Wakaba looking at her with interest. &quot;Oh ho, 
who&#39;s the lucky man then?&quot;

Utena looked down at her hair floating on the surface of the water. &quot;The 
Prince at the time...Prince Dios.&quot; Anthy and Wakaba gave a start. Wakaba 
hastily made the sign of the God&#39;s Hand over her heart, bowing her head 
reverently while Anthy clasped a hand to her heart to refrain from doing 
the same. Utena gazed at them a moment, before speaking.

&quot;He wasn&#39;t a god. Not then anyway...heck, it&#39;s been two thousand years, 
who knows what he is now. But...at the time he was a Prince. A young 
one. A very kind and noble one.&quot;

Utena&#39;s face took on a wistful look. She could still see it in her mind, 
his proud form as he addressed throngs of soldiers before they went out 
to war in his name. His clear voice as he spoke of the horrors of war, 
and the evil of the enemy. His gentle smile when he had held her hand on 
the operating table...

Wakaba&#39;s hands had stopped. She was looking at something on Utena&#39;s 
back. Utena felt a hesitant fingertip trace along a path that went from 
one shoulder and disappeared below the rim of the bathtub. Her voice was 
slightly shaky as she spoke.

&quot;L-Lady Utena...this...&quot;

Anthy leaned forward in her seat near the door. Unable to see because of 
the steaming bath, she stood and drew closer. Utena was watching water 
droplets on the tip of her finger, a blank expression on her face. 
Feeling the silence in the room drag on, she suddenly stood up in a 
smooth motion. Water cascaded down her nude back, curving along the bend 
of her knees and down her legs. Her face turned away from the both of 
them, so that her expression could not be seen, they watched as she 
pulled aside her long hair.

On her back was a massive scar that nearly dissected her body. It was at 
least two handbreadths wide, tearing cruelly down one shoulder at an 
angle, until it had reached the opposite side of her hip. Anthy was 
mesmerized by the flaw on that nearly perfect skin. Who had...done this 
to her...?

Utena spoke in a tone that Anthy had begun associating with the 
Guardian. It was controlled, empty, dead...a soldier&#39;s voice. It was a 
voice she had...used to have...before she met Utena.

It was a voice so very different from the simple joyous one, which had 
laughed after eating a mallah berry for the first time.

&quot;I died once you know...but Dios saved my life, more than once. He gave 
me a chance to serve, when no one else would. I would have given my life 
for him. Instead I...I will...live for him.&quot;

Anthy looked at the ground feeling sorrow for the lost time traveler. 
How sad it must be to lose everything in one day, and wake up in a new 
world? She felt a new sympathy for the woman. Moving to stand aside by a 
vanity dresser, Anthy leaned against it, watching her new friends. 
Wakaba was clutching the scrubbing cloth, her face reverent at the 
mention of Dios&#39; name. &quot;Kaiathi un Dios...you are truly the Right Hand 
of the God...&quot; Utena turned to look at her, letting her hair plop back 
over the scar. Hiding it. It was then that Anthy&#39;s eyes were draw to 
what little she could see of the warrior woman&#39;s chest.

Burned into the skin over her heart was the sigil of a rose. It was the 
same as the one on her suit of armor.

Utena&#39;s glowing blue eyes met hers for a moment, peering over her 
shoulder. Those eyes were framed by her pink bangs, accentuated by that 
pale creamy skin and perfectly toned back. Anthy felt an electricity 
jump between them, one that went through her heart and straight down 
between her legs. Shocked by the burning intensity of her reaction, she 
worked to keep her face well schooled, as she gripped the edge of the 
vanity. Her whitening knuckles were hidden behind the folds of her 
dress. Utena looked away, unaware of Anthy&#39;s near slip. She sighed and 
began to reach for a robe that had been placed upon a chair. 

&quot;Thank you for your assistance, Wakaba. But I believe it&#39;s time I began 
my patrols...&quot; Hearing the dismissal in those quiet words, Wakaba 
nodded. She helped Utena step from to tub, and readied a change of 
clothes. Utena took little time to change into the elegant doublet and 
men&#39;s pants that had been left for her. They were a bit big on her 
slender frame, but she wouldn&#39;t have to worry once she was back inside 
her suit. Climbing inside, the armor resealed about her body, and she 
headed for the door. Giving a silent bow to the two women, she departed, 
closing it.

When she had left, Anthy sighed. &quot;...It seems her past is...something 
painful.&quot; Her eyes flicked to the servant girl, who was cleaning things 
up and preparing to empty out the bath water. &quot;I trust you will...keep 
in confidence what you have heard here today.&quot;

Wakaba looked up at the Princess, brushing messy brown bangs from her 
eyes. Her brown eyes looked sad, as she gave a nod. &quot;Yeah...of course. I 
won&#39;t say a word. You know...&quot;

She trailed off looking at the brush in her hands, &quot;The servants 
here...really respect the two of you. What the Guardian&#39;s trying to 
do...and you coming back to take back your birthright. We support 
you...&quot;

Anthy was touched. &quot;Thank you Wakaba...&quot;

Wakaba gave her a cheerful smile as she hastily threw herself into her 
work. &quot;Yeah, so um. Don&#39;t worry about things, okay? The Guardian is 
really a nice person...I think that...she&#39;s going to make things better 
for everyone.&quot;

&quot;Yes...I do believe you&#39;re right.&quot; For the first time...Anthy dared to 
hope. She smiled as she looked down at the broken helm resting on the 
chair.

And outside the door, hiding behind the frame, another person was 
smiling. So many new things to learn...and so many games that could be 
played... This Guardian was becoming quite interesting. They would need 
to report these new findings to the King...
