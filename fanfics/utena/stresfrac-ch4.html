<h1>Stress Fractures (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/stresfrac-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Utena dreamed that night. It was almost a relief to do so, for it gave 
her a context for her recent experiences. It was that old dream, the 
one from her childhood, the one that had been so dear to her. Bells 
and lofty towers, the scent of roses, and the flash of swords. And her 
Prince. She could feel herself begin to weep as she stood in the 
deserted castle, while all about her crumbled.

Even as she dreamed, Utena knew this dream. When her Aunt had moved, 
this dream had come to her often, she could practically remember the 
names of those that peopled it. Red hair, then blue, then orange 
tickled at her mind, then silver made her heart stop with fear and 
excitement. She stood on the top of a stair and a rose was placed onto 
her chest - she could not see whose hand placed it there. Blood rushed 
through her veins as she fought. Then her sobs became cries of agony 
and thousands of stab wounds filled her with grief, once again, just 
as it had done, so long ago, when she had been a child. And she woke, 
as she had done, those long years ago, and wept with loss and 
humiliation. 

As the sun lifted it wan head over unforgiving, grey clouds, Utena lay 
in her bed, while streams of tears flowed down her face, but could not 
wash the pain away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Its small, but I&#146;ve always kept it clean. I hope you&#146;ll like it.&quot; The 
landlady was typical of her kind, Anthy thought. Penurious, but not 
overly so, and kindly, in a pinch.

&quot;I&#146;m sure I will.&quot; Anthy put forth a reassuring air. &quot;I don&#146;t need 
much and I&#146;m quiet, usually. I&#146;m a writer and I like quiet.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The landlady was not overly interested in her new tenant&#146;s 
career choice, obviously. &quot;Well, here&#146;s the keys. This one&#146;s for the 
front door, and here&#146;s the key to your apartment. I do have an extra 
for emergencies...&quot; Anthy let her attention slip as she was shown 
around the small apartment, while each facility was lauded and her own 
proper behavior ensured.

They once again reached the front door and the landlady turned to 
refresh her image of the room. &quot;Now,&quot; she began, glancing at Anthy 
sidelong. &quot;How long did you say you&#146;d need the room for?&quot;

Anthy smiled beatifically at the women, who smiled back, without 
really knowing why. &quot;As long as it takes.&quot;

Still smiling, the landlady bustled out and Anthy closed the door 
behind her. Still smiling, she opened the window to let the 
storm-laden air enter the room. 

The hardest part was over.
