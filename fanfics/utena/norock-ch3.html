<a href="../utena/norock-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>That Unusual Sound

The throbbing bass and the colored strobe lights that flashed upon the 
mass of bodies pulsating on the dance floor were things that were a 
customary sight at the Crimson Dream nightclub. The array of elegant 
booths that lined the walls of the club, and the tables on the second 
story of the place, were jammed with enthusiastic youths and classy 
night life. Outside the ornate double doors a massive bouncer had his 
arms crossed at a trailing line of people, all who waited patiently for 
the chance to experience the club&#39;s exotic sensations.

Inside, large silk tapestries extended from a massive centerpiece iron 
work chandelier on the ceiling, to come ghosting down the walls like 
some sort of tent. Scantily clad waitresses dress in black tuxedo 
bathing suits and bow ties, were serving drinks. A well stocked and 
modern looking bar was nestled against the back wall. Steel ladders 
twined upward to form gilded cages where exotic dancers gyrated and 
entertained. The flashing colored lights shined upon a dj&#39;s booth on a 
dais in front of the vast dance floor. Behind it was a young woman with 
a cap pulled low over her eyes and loose baseball shirt. Spinning off 
techno and throbbing dance mixes that sent the mass of bodies moving 
below, she glanced up and gave a small nod to where the club owner 
watched her patiently in the back.

The man in question was an elegant red head, as elegant as everything 
else in his sphere of influence, who was at the moment somewhat occupied 
with three ladies on each arm. Within his booth, he smiled and charmed 
his way among the six cooing and giggling women, who all looked as if 
they were wanting to taste more than the fancy alcoholic drinks they 
held. He gave a nod in return to the young woman who worked on her task 
to keep the club hopping and vibrant. It would seem she would do well 
here...her music selection had been quite adequate so far. The matter of 
her choice of dress was of course was something that needed to be 
discussed. But all in all, Touga Kiryuu was quite pleased with how well 
his chain of clubs had been taking off. It gave him a chance to explore 
his inner creativity through an avenue much to his tastes.

He closed his eyes and leaned back into the nuzzling embrace of the girl 
who called herself &#39;Angel&#39;, and just listened. The music merged into the 
next song, and suddenly the club slowed as it came on. The bass had 
slowed into a steady, strong pulsation and the faint sound of a drum 
keeping beat could be heard. It sounded as though a piano were playing, 
but what had unexpectedly caught the attention of the dancers and 
drinkers was the rolling velvet voice of a woman who began singing.

I can hear it in the rustling curtains

The sound that only shadows have

I&#39;m thinking of you baby

Can you feel me, maybe?

A man shuddered on the dance floor, his eyes closed and his face held in 
rapt wonderment. That sultry voice seemed to slip across the crowd, 
making them sigh in pleasure. Then as they seemed to individually regain 
their senses, they began moving in slow time to the beat, couples 
appeared and wrapped arms about each other. Foreheads leaned against 
shoulders and chests, as men and women began slowly swaying in rhythm.

Touga&#39;s eyes held confusion. What was this song? This...this...purely 
sensual piece that had captivated his nightclub? He could almost feel 
the sexual tension soaking the room. He had never heard anything like 
it! He closed his eyes again and just listened, his recent acquisitions 
had stilled too, snuggling along his arms and the swell of his chest. 
Something so hauntingly familiar yet completely alien...it tugged at his 
mind like nothing ever had before. Timeless...that was what it was...

He leaned down to brush lips across the forehead of the blonde, but 
paused in mid-motion as he looked at her closely. Her eyes were 
unfocused, and they darted ever so slightly...moving as if they were 
seeing a vision before them. Odd. What was...

He looked at his other women, and found they too had that same slack 
gaze...as if they were dreaming with their eyes open. It disconcerted 
him for some reason he couldn&#39;t put his finger on. All around him, it 
was the same. If he had to put a word to it, he&#39;d have to say they were 
bespelled. But...by the strange woman&#39;s voice alone? She was good, 
yes...but other than that... He didn&#39;t see what the strange draw was.

In the back of Kiryuu&#39;s mind, a warning was buzzing. Something was not 
right...He used his hand to turn one of his &#39;friends&#39; to look him in the 
eye, and spoke to her seductively but firmly. &quot;My dear...is something 
the matter?&quot; What is happening to you? She seemed to be pulling herself 
from far away to answer him, a dreamy look on her face, &quot;It&#39;s so 
beautiful...this song...it makes me think of rose-colored bed sheets...&quot; 
Touga smile widened and he was about to remark a bit on this particular 
phrasing, when the woman in his right arm sighed contentedly and chimed 
in, &quot;Yes...and white castles...&quot;

He stopped in surprise. Castles?...why on earth... There was nothing 
even close to such a thing in the lyrics of the song. What on earth made 
her come up with that odd image? That worried alarm in the back of his 
mind was beginning to buzz again more anxiously. He turned his head and 
made to listen more closely to the song again. Was there mention of 
castles? Maybe he had missed it.

Let me pour out my thoughts

One last lullaby...

The moonlight hidden by the gale

A creaking boat without a sail

Softly and coolly I whisper

Calling back to me
Can you hear me baby?

I can nearly touch you, maybe...

There was no mention of castles or bed sheets or any such thing...the 
song itself reminded him of the old clubs in the detective movies with 
the woman in the red dress singing as everyone sipped martinis. In fact, 
he had given one of his clubs that exact feel. But it wasn&#39;t the words 
that struck him, it was the woman&#39;s tone and purring coil in her words. 
If he closed his eyes and rested his head back, he could almost picture 
velvet being rubbed along inside his skull. He shuddered as goosebumps 
ran up his arms and a warm tingle ran down his spine. It was an 
enjoyable voice. So why was it he suddenly didn&#39;t want to listen 
anymore?...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The last couple had just departed, and Touga had sent his beauties away, 
pleading lightly that he had business to conduct and he wouldn&#39;t wish to 
bore them. But honestly he simply didn&#39;t want to deal with their 
presence at the moment. He was beginning to feel ill at ease within his 
own club. Touga was now standing behind his office desk, located in a 
private room on the second floor of the club. Before him stood the young 
woman who had just been taken on to be in charge of the club&#39;s music. 
Her ball cap was pushed up and her brown eyes were visible as they 
steadily waited to hear what her new employer had to say.

&quot;Ah yes, Mari Hozumi...I felt that you were quite exceptional in your 
performance tonight. Remarkable indeed, I would be glad to hire you on 
to work full time. Of course I&#39;m afraid we must have some manner of 
dress code, in order to carry on with the theme of the club. I hope you 
understand...&quot;

Mari gave a smile and a nod of acceptance. &quot;Of course, sir.&quot;

Touga smiled warmly his red silk mane falling gently around his face as 
he moved to come around the desk to hand her a small stack of papers. 
&quot;These further explain what your hours would be, your weekly pay, and 
what all would be required of you. It also lists the benefits that come 
with your position. I&#39;m pleased to have you aboard.&quot; He extended a hand 
and she took it without hesitation to grasp it in a handshake.

He smiled again, &quot;I hope that you will be able to start next week on 
Thursday. As you can see, for my club&#39;s atmosphere I require a competent 
person to handle the music. Will that be alright with you?&quot;

Mari gave a surprised grin, &quot;A-ah yes! That&#39;s be fantastic-err I mean, 
yes sir.&quot;

Touga gave a chuckle that seemed to dance in the space between them. 
&quot;Don&#39;t be concerned with formalities...I&#39;m certain you will do just 
fine. Thank you again.&quot; Mari gave a bow and made to leave when his voice 
halted her.

&quot;Ah, Hozumi-san...what was that one song you played...the slow one with 
the woman singing?&quot;

Mari looked back, instant recognition on her face, &quot;Oh that one...I&#39;m 
sorry if it wasn&#39;t to your tastes Kiryuu-san...it just happens to be a 
favorite of mine. I really like the singer. It&#39;s called &#39;Imagination&#39;.&quot;

Touga&#39;s eyebrow gracefully lifted, &quot;I must say, it was quite 
extraordinary...and who is the artist?&quot;

Mari&#39;s eyes seemed to go unfocused as she replied, &quot;Her name is 
Ten...she&#39;s the lead singer of a group called Crysanthium Ecstasy...such 
a lovely voice too... I absolutely adore her!&quot; Shaking her head a bit 
she came back to herself, looking embarassed. Bowing again, Mari took 
her leave.

Touga sat down behind his desk contemplatively. Ten...an odd stage name 
to be sure...just what sort of group was Crysanthium Ecstasy anyway? It 
didn&#39;t sound like the sort of music he would normally be interested 
in...

He checked the time and realized it was quite late. He&#39;d need to head 
back to his apartment and get some sleep if he was to meet with Saionji 
tomorrow morning. The two of them were supposed to have tea and catch up 
on old times, but if he knew his childhood friend he&#39;d most likely get 
roped into a match with the dojo leader. He smiled in anticipation of 
the thought. Standing and moving to the door, Touga began to make his 
way home.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

It had slowly become the dark hours of the next morning as he dried his 
hair from his shower and listened to the messages on his voice mail, he 
frowned as he kept thinking over the oddness of his club that night. 
Something was niggling him stubbornly...and it probably wouldn&#39;t let him 
sleep until he sated his curiosity. Moving over into the den, where his 
desk and computer were set up in one corner, he sat down in the hardwood 
black chair, and flicked on the monitor.

It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to see what this Ten woman looked like...in his 
own mind he pictured a classic beauty with an aristocratic flair to her 
grace. Typing into the search engine on the internet browser, Touga 
pushed his hair back over his shoulder as he waited momentarily. With 
moments, several hundred sites popped up onto his screen, shrines and 
information places on this musical group...but most of them revolved 
around &#39;Ten&#39;.

Clicking on one name among the lists, he waited as the page loaded onto 
the screen...and stared in absolute shock. A face looked back at him, 
frozen in time...eyes like the clearest skies, but they held disdain and 
cool rejection for whatever they were staring back at. Rose-tinted pink 
hair had been cut short and gelled into spikes, and there were several 
ear piercings to mar that perfect pale skin. She wore a torn sleeveless 
black shirt with a random band name in red letters smeared across its 
front. All in all, a rough and uncivilized looking character...but that 
face...god that face was so damn familiar! He had seen this face before, 
and he knew in his bones that she had not looked like this before.

There was a stabbing sensation behind his eyes...as if something in his 
mind was breaking and cracking apart, but he paid it no heed. He just 
stared at the face of this woman, whom he distantly realized was 
standing in the middle of a group of people...her bandmates he assumed. 
But it was to her that all eyes turned. It was she that drew the 
gazes...even her dress and hair style couldn&#39;t take away from the 
breath-taking beauty she possessed. Poised with a dangerous edge...who 
was this girl?

He suddenly felt dizzy, and didn&#39;t know why. Something was suddenly 
wrong with him...what...what was...

He stumbled back and fell over onto his back, taking the chair down with 
him. The chair leg had accidentally looped underneath the power cord, 
and with an angry zzzzzt the screen blipped out to black. He held his 
head, trying to regain his composure and senses, but couldn&#39;t seem to 
make anything work right. Holding onto the desk edge like a life line, 
he managed to drag himself to his feet, but ended up knocking papers off 
and send them flying like startled white birds.
Have to...get to...the phone...

He took a sudden lurch forward, and like a drunk man, used the back of 
the couch to try and keep him upright as he made his way back toward the 
phone and its answering machine. A crash and a splash of water across 
his bare feet told him he had shattered the vase of flowers as his hands 
fumbled for the phone. He managed to grab a hold of the entire cradle 
and phone, when he pitched forward unexpectedly. His eyes rolled up into 
his head even before he hit the ground, crumpling awkwardly and without 
the grace he normally exhibited. Collapsed, with his wrist and arm 
tangled up in the phone cord, one arm flung outward Touga Kiryuu passed 
out...

...and dreamed...
