Mrs. Ohtori watched Shiori walk away from her and closed her eyes in 
thought.

She had felt the battle between Utena and the vampire princess Miyu, 
sensed the massive energies that had clashed all the way across the 
city from her. It shouldn&#39;t have been possible for such a young 
vampire as Utena being able to survive against Miyu, but she had done 
it. Ever Mrs. Ohtori was cautious around Miyu!

If this battle truly reflected Utena&#39;s powers, then it changed 
everything. Her chasing of Utena stopped being a amusing little game 
of vengeance and the girl became a serious threat to her. Her eyes 
opened wide, &#39;Or an opportunity.&quot;

She walked to the window and looked out at the lights of the city, 
thinking back to what she had learned about this Utena. Back at Ohtori 
academy she had been well on her way to becoming a legend. And the 
first tale of that legend had been her defeat of Akio... Shiori had 
told her about it, when Mrs. Ohtori had asked her. She wasn&#39;t sure if 
she believed the story or not, but after what she had seen lately, it 
seemed more and more possible!

The party at the observatory had begun at sundown, quickly a mad, 
energetic thing. The place was filled with the vampirized members of 
the student council, human slaves, and their willing human allies. 
Akio ruled over these things like a king on his throne, occasionally 
favoring an especially fare lady with a touch of his fangs.

Touga Kiryuu and his dog Saionji stood by their lord&#39;s side. Keeping 
some distance from the three Arisugawa Juri observed the festivities 
coldly, only drinking a bit of blood from the slaves. Other, lesser 
vampires moved through the crowds, trying to curry favor from their 
dark lord.

There was a disturbance at the door, and they looked up to see the 
large outer doors break as a figure was hammered right through them. 
&quot;Who dares,&quot; Touga cried.

The crowd parted to give a clear look at the doors, and for the first 
time they saw... her. Instead of normal girl&#39;s clothes she wore a 
traditional boy&#39;s school uniform, the long black pants and jacket 
highlighting her almost bone pale coloring. Long pink hair flowed down 
her back, and her face had the most shockingly blue eyes.

&quot;Who is she?&quot; Juri asked, her voice showing her admiration.

The pink haired woman raised the wooden practice sword and declared, 
&quot;My name is Tenjou Utena!&quot; Utena pointed with the blade towards where 
Akio sat, &quot;And I&#39;m here to challenge you.&quot;

As he rose from his seat Akio tossed his purple hair back with a 
clearly practiced gesture. &quot;I know that you&#39;re upset over how I 
changed you,&quot; he smiled charmingly, his voice flowing like honey, &quot;but 
that&#39;s no reason to do anything foolish.&quot;

Utena had to grit her teeth as Akio&#39;s power flowed outward from him, a 
willpower that had been enough to easily compel the strongest vampires 
of Ohtori. And with a single gesture Utena shrugged it off, biting 
out, &quot;Face me.&quot;

Akio gazed over at her in surprise. He smoothly stepped down, his 
expression serious as he said, &quot;Pass me a sword.&quot;

Touga tossed him a wooden practice sword, &quot;Here, my lord.&quot;

The sword dropped smoothly into Akio&#39;s hand as he smiled bleakly at 
Utena, &quot;You do know that I am the champion duelist of Ohtori?&quot;

&quot;Shut up and fight,&quot; Utena said as she charged him.

The two swords met with a loud crack, testing muscle and will against 
each other. Utena met his eyes coolly, and Akio&#39;s began to look just a 
bit worried.

Again and again they clashed, each of them searching for any weakness 
in the other&#39;s guard. The wooden swords quickly began to splinter, the 
weapons becoming even more dangerous to the two vampires, not less.

They separated, standing facing each other a moment. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
understand?&quot; Akio demanded angrily, &quot;I am the prince of this school!&quot;

Utena stood there, her body almost glowing in a single beam of 
moonlight. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you are a man or woman,&quot; she murmured 
softly, then adding much more loudly, &quot;one of strength and nobility is 
always a prince!&quot;

They faced each other, looking for some weakness in each others guard, 
even as the crowd watched in awe. Touga made his way to Juri&#39;s side, 
&quot;Do you think out lord might... loose?&quot;

&quot;If you had asked me yesterday, I would have said no,&quot; Juri answered 
quietly.

&quot;Guard yourself,&quot; Utena declared, charging.

Akio raised his sword in reflex, the two wooden blades coming together 
loudly. Utena&#39;s blade shattered, splinters scattering around them, but 
she firmly kept the hilt in her hands. She deflected his strike, 
taking it on her shoulder, then Utena stepped in close and shoved the 
shattered remnant of her blade into his chest!

&quot;Urk,&quot; Akio spat black blood against her chest. His body fell limply 
against Utena, then slowly slid down to the floor. She pushed the body 
off of her, and he lay there in a boneless head.

There was the sound of running, and Utena noted that the vampires had 
fled the room as soon as they realized that Akio was defeated. Only 
Juri lingered there a moment. Utena met the orange haired woman&#39;s 
eyes, who smiled slightly and saluted her gravely. Then she was gone 
as well.

The humans lingered, gazing at her in shock and no little awe. &quot;Get 
out of here,&quot; Utena said, her eyes flashing, and they fled.

Looking out at the darkened city of Tokyo, Mrs. Ohtori shook her head 
ruefully. She had thought that it was just an exaggeration, that Utena 
had somehow caught Akio by surprise. But if as a newly made vampire 
she was that strong, what was Utena capable of now?

&#39;What could she eventually be capable of?&#39; Mrs. Ohtori thought grimly.</pre>
