<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 19 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>        &quot;Damn,&quot; Victoria swore softly, the blonde haired vampire&#39;s eyes 
wide as she felt the presence that was nearing the bar, &quot;if that&#39;s 
Ohtori out there, she&#39;s old.&quot;

        Integra narrowed her eyes in thought. &quot;As old as Arucard is?&quot; 
she asked Victoria, her gray hair flowing down her back.

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Victoria nodded, referring to the vampire who had 
created her, &quot;or even older. I&#39;ve never felt something like this 
before.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s a odd chill to the air,&quot; Anthy agreed softly.

        Utena stood there for a moment, the sword Saya gave her in her 
hand. &quot;Do we go out to meet her,&quot; she mused thoughtfully, &quot;or....&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll follow your lead,&quot; Juri reached out to gently put her 
hand on Utena&#39;s arm, standing there calmly at her lover&#39;s side.

        Utena closed her eyes for a few seconds and there seemed to 
appear an air of utter serenity all around her. There was a firm knock 
on the front door and Utena smiled slightly. &quot;Enter freely,&quot; she called 
out, &quot;and of your own free will.&quot;

        A couple of vampire servants entered the bar first to check for 
a trap, then a few human hangers on. Then she swept inside, the tall, 
pale blue haired woman. There was a feeling of power around her, her 
eyes glowing with an almost unearthly force. She looked around the room, 
her gaze finally settling on where Utena stood defiantly.

        &quot;Is that her?&quot; Utena asked Juri softly, not turning from the 
contest of wills going on, each trying to stare down the other.

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Juri said with a fierce scowl, standing there 
defiantly even against the power that Mrs. Ohtori possessed.

        Mrs. Ohtori turned away first, the oddest expression on her 
face. &quot;Tenjou Utena,&quot; she walked over to say calmly, those scarlet lips 
rising in a odd little smile, &quot;we meet at last.&quot;

        Utena seemed entirely unaffected by the power radiating off the 
elder vampire, meeting her eyes calmly. &quot;I&#39;m glad you could make it,&quot; 
she said as her allies moved into position, &quot;I was worried your 
invitation was lost in the mail.&quot;

        &quot;Not what I expected,&quot; the woman in a slinky red gown said, &quot;not 
what I expected at all.&quot; Mrs. Ohtori looked at Utena thoughtfully, &quot;So 
what do we do now?&quot;

        Utena set the sword down on top of the table, settling down in 
her chair casually. She gestured to an empty seat and said, &quot;Would you 
care for a drink?&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ohtori gave a regal nod. Her followers seemed as 
surprised as Utena&#39;s as she settled into a seat at the table. &quot;Blood and 
wine?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;If you wish,&quot; Utena nodded. She made a summoning gesture and 
Minagi appeared beside the table, formally presenting the elder vampire 
with her drink. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena said with a smile to her before she 
returned to the bar.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Minagi grinned at Utena, clearly enjoying the 
show before the blue haired woman teleported away.

        Mrs. Ohtori took a drink, studying Utena thoughtfully. She 
didn&#39;t look like a monster, instead she was a beautiful if eccentric 
young woman, dressed in the black schoolboy&#39;s uniform. Her most striking 
figure was the robin&#39;s blue eyes that seemed to look right into you.

        Juri took a seat right beside Utena, but it was obviously with 
the greatest reluctance. From the deadly glare the orange haired 
vampiress gave Mrs. Ohtori she clearly remembered the beating she had 
received at the woman&#39;s hands.

        &quot;What is Utena thinking?&quot; Wakaba squeaked out nervously, the 
pretty younger girl holding a stake in a sweaty hand.

        &quot;Wait and see,&quot; Shiori frowned, wondering herself what was going 
on.

        &quot;Should we...?&quot; Victoria Ceres asked softly, looking 
suspiciously towards where the vampire and human followers waited 
patiently.

        &quot;Let Utena play out her hand,&quot; Anthy advised softly.

        &quot;And if she fails,&quot; Integra murmured, &quot;it falls to us.&quot;

        Over at the table Juri&#39;s eyes glinted with restrained anger. 
&quot;It&#39;s been a while,&quot; she said to the older woman coldly.

        &quot;That it has,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori agreed with Juri calmly, drinking 
some her wine. She set the cup down then turned to look at the sword 
Utena had laid across the table, &quot;I rather expected you to attack as 
soon as I met you.&quot;

        &quot;I probably would have once,&quot; Utena said to her simply, &quot;but I 
had an interesting little conversation with Miyu earlier.&quot;

        &quot;The vampire princess,&quot; Ohtori murmured thoughtfully.

        &quot;She suggested I try to settle this without fighting,&quot; Utena 
said softly. She looked at Mrs. Ohtori thoughtfully, &quot;What is it you 
want?&quot;

        &quot;I have what I want,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori actually smirked, raising her 
hand and snapping her fingers dramatically. There was a burst of 
movement from Utena&#39;s allies and Shiori ran over to Ohtori&#39;s side, 
dropping to kneel beside her.

        &quot;Shiori,&quot; Juri rose from her seat but Utena grabbed her arm, 
keeping her from going across the table at Mrs. Ohtori.

        &quot;Mistress,&quot; Shiori murmured, and Juri froze at the sound.

        Even in their most intimate moments together Juri hadn&#39;t heard 
such caring in Shiori&#39;s voice, such honest warmth. &#39;Utena was right,&#39; 
Juri realized, fighting back a surge of rage. Shiori had been turned 
during the time that she had spent in Mrs. Ohtori&#39;s hands and now she 
was following the master vampire willingly. Juri saw the light in 
Shiori&#39;s face and thought despairingly, &#39;Eagerly, even.&#39;

        Utena narrowed her eyes, fighting an urge to lash out. As the 
vampire who had turned Shiori she could exert some control over her, 
but.... She looked at the way Mrs. Ohtori looked at Shiori, and there 
was a gentle love in her gaze.

        &quot;And Kanae?&quot; Utena asked coldly.

        Mrs. Ohtori&#39;s eyes flashed with anger, her power surging up with 
her rage. &quot;Don&#39;t say her name,&quot; she growled out angrily.

        &quot;She didn&#39;t kill Kanae, you know,&quot; Juri spoke up, her voice 
trembling just a bit as she faced the power of the woman, &quot;not really.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Mrs. Ohtori was surprised enough to let go of her rage a 
moment.

        &quot;She committed suicide,&quot; Juri continued on firmly, &quot;she just 
used Utena to do it.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori hissed.

        &quot;You&#39;ve tasted my blood,&quot; Juri said with a flash of anger, 
&quot;you&#39;d be able to tell!&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know if I like the look of this,&quot; Ami murmured, the 
blue haired young woman standing with the other girls.

        Hitomi pushed her short brown hair out of her eyes, watching 
Ohtori&#39;s human and vampire servants warily. Then she turned to gaze at 
Anthy and her two friends and added, &quot;They could be trouble, too.&quot;

        &quot;Whatever happens,&quot; Wakaba said firmly, &quot;we&#39;ll help Utena-sama.&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Excel agreed, blonde hair bouncing. She frowned 
cutely, &quot;I just wish we&#39;d been able to grab Shiori before she took off.&quot;

        &quot;Next time,&quot; Ami flashed a dangerous smile, her blue hair 
shining in the light.</pre>
