<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound (part 2 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Without any warning, they leapt at each other almost at the same time, 
colliding in midair like some twisted aerial ballet. They madly 
scrambled at each other for a moment before returning to the Earth. 
Touga reached up to his shoulder, a surprised expression on his face, 
and his hand came away bloody.

&quot;You are such a fool, Tenjou,&quot; Touga said softly, looking at his blood 
stained palm. He clenches it into a fist, crying out &quot;You fed from 
Lord Akio himself! You could be ruling the student council, not 
fighting us!&quot;

&quot;Not interested,&quot; Utena said calmly in reply, and she charged him 
again.

Touga seemed to change, the normally handsome face fading as the 
monster within him came out to play. Hands like claws, he tore at 
Utena, his fangs snapping as he fought to gain any advantage over her.

Utena cried out as his claws raked across her brow, blood spilling 
down into her eyes. She swept it away with a gesture, but not fast 
enough to save her from his next strike. The blow to her stomach 
staggered her, buying just enough time for him to leap through the 
window and disappear into the night.

She moved to the window to chase him, then she stopped. &#39;Out there in 
the dark, the hunter could easily become the hunted,&#39; she thought 
grimly. She turned and walked out of the room, only to be met by both 
Miki and Kozue.

&quot;You&#39;re all right!&quot; Kozue cried out happily. She ran forward, hugging 
Utena close to her, continuing, &quot;I though I was dead for sure!&quot;

The rich scent of blood was all over the girl, freshly made cuts and 
scrapes the obvious consequences of her fight with Touga. The scent 
seemed to reach a hidden part of Utena, summoning forth a primal 
hunger. For just a moment, her arms tightened around the girl as her 
fangs extended.

Utena quickly pushed the girl away, apologizing softly even as she 
turned and fled down the deserted hallway. Only when she was far 
enough away from that scent did she finally come to a stop. She leaned 
against the wall, her body shaking slightly.

&quot;I nearly,&quot; she gasped out softly, &quot;I nearly hurt her.&quot; A single tear, 
a lone trickle of red blood, coursed down her white cheek.

Juri watched from the shadows, carefully concealing herself from 
Utena&#39;s sharp senses. &#39;Poor little girl,&quot; Juri thought sadly, 
&#39;fighting what you are.&#39; She smiles, a slow, sexy smile, &#39;Let me teach 
you what you can be.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

It was nearly noon when the taxi arrived at Ohtori academy. No one 
travels at night, anymore, at least not in this part of the world. The 
cab driver quickly helped the young lady unpack her bags then he 
climbed back into his cab. With a loud squeal of his tires he was 
gone.

Anthy shook out her short purple hair, hefting her cases as she looked 
around the courtyard thoughtfully. She dressed traditionally, a long 
dark dress and simple white blouse, white socks and black leather 
shoes.

&#39;If the reports are true,&#39; Anthy thought, &#39;I&#39;ll find my brother here.&#39; 
She smiled to herself grimly, thinking of the wooden stakes in her 
bag, &#39;And at last I will end the curse on our family line.&#39;

She quickly arranged for her registration and sleeping quarters, then 
began to check out the school itself. The first thing she did was find 
the temporary head of the student council. Miki Kaoru.

The blue hared young man looked nervous, twitchy, sitting at the head 
of the table in the large meeting room. His school uniform looked 
rumpled, as if he had dressed hurriedly that morning. &quot;How can I help 
you, Mrs. Anthy?&quot; he asked softly.

She smiled slightly as she explained, &quot;I&#39;m here looking for my 
brother.&quot; At Miki&#39;s inquiring look, she elaborated, &quot;Akio Ohtori.&quot;

The blood seemed to drain from the boy&#39;s face, and for a moment Anthy 
feared he might faint. &quot;He&#39;s gone,&quot; Miki said simply, his hands 
visibly shaking.

&quot;Gone,&quot; Anthy echoed. &#39;Has he escaped me again?&#39; she frantically 
wondered. In a fierce tone, &quot;Where did he go? How long has he been 
gone?&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Miki said, shaking his head slightly as he held up a hand. 
&quot;Akio Ohtori is dead,&quot; he said to her softly.

&quot;Dead,&quot; Anthy said softly. She looked lost, somehow, as if she had 
lost something incredibly precious. &quot;Who did it?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t there to see it myself,&quot; Miki said quietly, &quot;but I 
understand that it was Tenjou Utena.&quot; Miki was visibly surprised as 
Anthy suddenly rose from her chair, a thoughtful expression on her 
beautiful face.

&quot;Thank you for your time, Mr. Kaoru,&quot; Anthy said, giving him a small 
bow. She left, frowning and lost in thought.

The rest of the day Anthy pursued her new quarry, this Tenjou Utena. 
She talked to students and teachers, quickly gathering a sense of who 
she had been. But Utena hadn&#39;t been seen for months, shortly after the 
disappearance of most of the old student council. Anthy quickly 
reached certain conclusions.

&#39;It&#39;s likely this Utena is a vampire, one created by Akio himself,&#39; 
she thought. &#39;Somehow, the young vampire had turned the tables on her 
elder, destroying him. But why? To rule the other vampires of Ohtori?&#39; 
she wondered

Anthy shook her head, thinking, &#39;It didn&#39;t matter, really. All that 
mattered was that Utena was a vampire, and she was a vampire slayer.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

Wakaba pushed open the door before Utena could even finish washing. 
&quot;Do you mind?&quot; Utena said with a little frown, standing there naked.

&quot;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen it all before,&quot; Wakaba said with a 
little shrug. She frowned, &quot;There&#39;s a strange lady at the school, 
asking about Akio and you. She says her name&#39;s Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know her,&quot; Utena started to say, when the door was 
slammed open.

&quot;Hold, spawn of darkness!&quot; Anthy declared, holding a cross in one hand 
and a stake in the other. &quot;Step away from the girl!&quot;

Utena and Wakaba stood motionless for a moment. &quot;Would you mind if I 
get dressed first?&quot; Utena asked her mildly, covering her naughty-bits 
with her hands.

&quot;Yeah, you shouldn&#39;t be seeing my Utena-sama naked,&quot; Wakaba said to 
Anthy firmly, stepping up to her and then turning her right around. 
Under her breath she added, &quot;Only I get to do that.&quot;

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Utena shot back, dressing as quickly as possible.

Anthy looked at Wakaba in surprise, &quot;The vampire wasn&#39;t attacking you? 
I guess you must be her servant, then.&quot;

Utena laughed softly at that. &quot;If she is,&quot; Utena said, her voice a 
little muffled as she pulled a shirt over her head, &quot;can I trade her 
in on an more obedient model?&quot;

Wakaba stuck her tongue out, &quot;Bleah!&quot;

Anthy looked back and forth between the two girls. She finally sighed 
softly to herself as she said, &quot;It seems I don&#39;t quite understand 
what&#39;s going on here. Would you two care to explain?&quot;

Finally dressed in her boy&#39;s uniform, Utena lit a small oil lamp, 
bringing some light into the long abandoned dorm room. She sat Anthy 
down in a salvaged chair, a bit rickety but stable. Wakaba took the 
other one, and Utena leaned against the wall, keeping some space 
between her and them.

&quot;You know what Akio was,&quot; Utena said softly to Anthy. The girl nodded, 
and she continued, &quot;I caught his eye, shortly after I transferred 
here. He courted me, tried to win me over, and when charm failed, he 
took by force.&quot;

&quot;He raped me first, then he bit me,&quot; Utena said, tipping her head back 
to reveal the faint fang marks on her neck, &quot;but for some reason he 
decided to turn me. He cut his arm, pressed it to my lips, and his 
foul blood filled my mouth until I had to swallow or choke.&quot;

&quot;She woke up three days later,&quot; Wakaba said, sounding much more 
serious. &quot;We were roommates, and I saw Akio bring her back and leave 
her there. Because of some of the stories about him, I was worried 
about her.&quot;

Utena continued, &quot;I was ravenous. I fought against it, kept myself 
from attacking her, and Wakaba figured out what I had become. She went 
out into the hallway and caught me a rat to feed on.&quot;

&quot;Akio must have thought you&#39;d feed on your friend,&quot; Anthy said softly. 
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a newborn vampire resisting the hunger before,&quot; 
she said wonderingly, shaking her head.

&quot;It&#39;s not easy,&quot; Utena said softly, and Anthy suddenly understood why 
she kept her distance. She looked at the pale face lit by the golden 
lamp light, and was a little in awe of the strength she saw there.

Wakaba took up the story again, &quot;We moved Utena into this abandoned 
dorm that night, and she hunted in the woods for the first time.&quot; She 
looked very passionate as she added, &quot;She only feeds on animals, not 
humans, Ms Anthy.&quot;

&quot;For now,&quot; Anthy said softly.

&quot;For now,&quot; Utena quietly agreed. Her eyes met Anthy&#39;s, &quot;And if I ever 
cross that line to feed on human beings, I hope there&#39;ll be someone 
like you around to stop me.&quot; She took a deep breath, continuing, 
&quot;Eventually, I faced Akio. He underestimated my strength, I think, and 
I was able to stake him.&quot;

Wakaba sighed softly, &quot;But he was a busy little vampire before Utena 
stopped him. He turned most of the student council to vampires.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to stop them ever since,&quot; Utena sighed.

Anthy looked at the two young women thoughtfully. &#39;They didn&#39;t seem to 
be lying,&#39; she mused, and rose to her feet. &quot;I&#39;m going to go check out 
your story,&quot; she said respectfully, &quot;If you&#39;ve told me the truth, I&#39;d 
like to help you.&quot; Slightly grimly, she added, &quot;If you&#39;ve lied to me, 
I&#39;ll stake you.&quot;

&quot;Medium rare, please,&quot; Wakaba quipped, spoiling a serious moment. She 
got a glare from both Utena and Anthy. &quot;Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist,&quot; she 
said with a small shrug. </pre>
