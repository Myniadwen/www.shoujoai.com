<h1>Just Like Clockwork (part 7 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/clockwork-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Anthy rode at a steady gallop, with her servant Wakaba keeping pace at 
her side. The wind was whipping freely through her hair; the princess&#39; 
simple traveling dress comfortable on her dark shoulders as the sun 
warmed her back like a cloak. She could smell the scent of wild flowers 
and heather, crushed underneath the hooves of the large black mare she 
rode. Next to her, Wakaba was jostling about in her saddle, a sour 
expression on her face as she winced with every bump. It wasn&#39;t often 
the brown haired girl went out...and clearly, she wasn&#39;t that skilled of 
a rider. But to Anthy, who had often rode bareback along the winding 
paths of her village as a child, this was freedom...

Slowing their pace once the castle had become little more than a 
shapeless smudge on the horizon, Anthy motioned for Wakaba to do the 
same. Her companion looked only too happy.

&quot;Bless me, but this thing&#39;s a monster! Never before have I ever ridden 
in a more uncomfortable saddle...&quot; Wakaba grumbled as she rubbed her 
posterior. They had been riding for a couple hours without stopping, 
Anthy in a hurry to put as much distance between her and her apartment 
room as possible. Smiling, her spirits light as they rode at a 
comfortable pace through the plodded dirt patches in the tall grass, 
Anthy replied calmly.

&quot;Well...I must admit I can&#39;t recall seeing you on too many saddles.&quot;

Wakaba snorted, &quot;No. I much prefer sitting on laps instead.&quot;

Anthy pretended a shocked look, raising a hand to her mouth scandalized. 
&quot;My goodness! Well don&#39;t let the kitchen staff hear you say that...isn&#39;t 
there a nice young scullery boy you&#39;ve been &#39;accidentally&#39; bumping 
into?&quot;

Wakaba blushed her eyes wide in surprise as she stammered. &quot;W-what? 
T-that&#39;s just silly now. Hmph! As if I would be interested in Tatsuya. 
He&#39;s just a wet-behind-the-ears soap sap.&quot; She flicked her reins taking 
her horse a bit ahead of Anthy&#39;s, her face scrunched up in annoyance as 
she heard the princess giggle behind her.

They rode on in silence. Wakaba scanning the grasslands about them for 
any signs of bandits, while her royal charge contented herself with 
watching the sparrows twittering in their grass nests. On their saddles 
dangled an odd wood ring tied with red and green thread, interlaced with 
a beaded pattern. She had insisted on Wakaba tying a similar one onto 
her own saddle horn stating that &#39;it would keep hostile eyes from 
peering their way&#39;. Wakaba had merely done it out of superstition...but 
didn&#39;t feel that a silly charm would protect them from big men with 
swords. She was starting to feel very antsy, sitting there exposed above 
a sea of swaying grass. Anything could be hiding in it...wild men or 
animals. And there had been rumors of a lot of black cowled thieves and 
brigands frequenting the outer reaches of the castle... Chewing on her 
bottom lip, brow knitted with worry, Wakaba suddenly began to regret her 
plan. Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea after all...

&quot;Say look there! Those broken stone pillars in the distance. See that 
shape on the distant mound, near that stand of trees? That should mark 
the entrance to the underground tombs.&quot; Anthy called to her, touching 
her shoulder. Giving a start, Wakaba looked up as well. Squinting her 
eyes and trying to peer through the harsh sunlight, she could just make 
out a weird shape ahead, peaking just over the field of green. Certainly 
not being any real judge of distance, Wakaba could only tell that&#39;d it 
take another long agonizing trip in the saddle before they&#39;d actually 
reach the place. If that was really the tomb.

&quot;Are you sure? Is that really it?&quot; Wakaba turned to Anthy, one eyebrow 
raised. The dark-skinned woman nodded, her face serene.

&quot;Yes. There can be no doubt. I feel the pulse of oldness about that 
area...an alien sensation rising from the depths of the earth...that 
place was only recently exposed. So it&#39;s quite distinct. Far more fresh 
to my senses than a place that had been unearthed for years.&quot; Anthy&#39;s 
eyes seemed to be looking at something far more distant than their 
destination. The green orbs unfocused and swirling with something other. 
Wakaba just shook her head.

&quot;You&#39;re certainly a strange one, your highness.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...&quot;

They increased their speed, their goal in sight. Anthy for her part was 
ecstatic. She was out free under the open sky, about to explore a tomb 
that was probably filled with mysteries and treasures about a 
civilization long forgotten. Ancients with ways far different than their 
own! People that might be like the ones that Utena came from... Anthy 
frowned slightly, remembering that easy smile glimpse in her divination 
bowl. Smiling at someone like... And not at... The princess&#39; thoughts 
turned pensive, moving away from her immediate surroundings. So it was 
that they were already slowing down outside the mined structure, before 
Anthy realized how much time had passed.

The two women carefully dismounted, Wakaba with far less grace, and tied 
their horses to a broken chunk of stone exposed next to the ruins. 
Leaving the animals to graze they then removed their saddlebags and 
withdrew their packs. Anthy gazed about her with anticipation, taking in 
the scene.

The stood at the mouth of what look liked a narrow cave entrance. Miners 
had hammered in large wooden support beams into the earth, and had 
already begun the process of making a network of lanterns to hang along 
the ceiling of the tunnel that gaped darkly before them. There were a 
series of weathered stone pillars, broken like teeth and jutting out 
from the ground. Their eroded faces were a testament to time, rough and 
bleached by the sun with thin tendrils of plant vines creeping up their 
bases. The miners here had left in a hurry, leaving some of their tools 
behind to weather and ruin. Someone had scrawled a warning symbol on one 
of the wooden beams, the holy symbol of Dios...letting all who gazed on 
it know that they stood on holy ground. The scrawled mark of the 
triangle, dissected by three rings encased by another triangle. They had 
come seeking minerals and ore, and instead had found history.

Anthy supposed it was enough to make anyone afraid.

Sighing, as she prepared to gather her courage and descend into the dark 
tomb below, she stopped suddenly. A sound...she had...just heard a 
sound...like horse hooves. Whirling in surprise Anthy looked up in shock 
as a massive black stallion came bearing straight toward them, cutting 
through the tall stalks of grass outside their clearing like a sword 
blade. And there...running alongside was--

&quot;L-Lord Guardian?!&quot; Wakaba squawked in fear, whirling in a flurry of 
brown skirts. The horse and its rider pulled to an abrupt halt just 
inside of their clearing with Utena coming to a clanking stop a little 
bit past. Anthy squinted and looked up to see Juri smiling down at her 
quietly. The princess gave a small frown of annoyance. Turning to the 
white armored cyborg she noticed Utena was staring at her with intensity 
and a frown as well. Anthy felt a bubble of anxiety build within.

&quot;Princess Anthy...what on earth are you doing out here? It isn&#39;t safe 
you know. You&#39;re supposed to be back at the castle.&quot;

Anthy sighed and straightened her skirts. &quot;Forgive me, Holy Guardian. I 
didn&#39;t mean to concern you with this.&quot;

Utena stood straighter and put a hand on her belt. &quot;Bandits have been 
scouting all over these trails. Two ladies alone on horseback will 
merely draw them more eagerly. My mission is to see to your safety. It 
is my main priority. I can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re gallivanting about the 
countryside for fun!&quot;

Anthy frowned more deeply, feeling hurt. Utena didn&#39;t trust her to even 
look after herself? Utena didn&#39;t even know what she was capable of, and 
here Anthy was being treated like a child. &quot;I wasn&#39;t &#39;gallivanting about 
the countryside&#39;...I was coming here to these ruins. I thought 
that...something inside might prove useful to you.&quot; Utena gave a small 
twitch of her hand, and looked away from Anthy&#39;s gaze. Juri watched the 
exchange quietly, her true thoughts hidden, while Wakaba nervously 
shifted her weight from foot to foot.

&quot;...Ruins. That sounds more than a little risky. You should have still 
informed me first of your intentions my lady.&quot;

Anthy looked over at Juri who now had her eyes trained back on her own. 
Once again, the violent haired woman felt that gnawing stir of jealousy 
rise within.

&quot;Forgive me, my Lord Guardian. But it would seem we couldn&#39;t find 
you...since you were rather busy with other business in the woods.&quot; Juri 
blinked, her expression never changing. But as Anthy continued to watch, 
she could see the faintest lifting of the corners of the council 
member&#39;s lips.

Utena shifted a boot in the dirt and worked to keep the frustration out 
of her voice. For some reason, Anthy was being difficult. What was she 
trying to imply exactly? Tossing her pink ponytail over her shoulder, 
Utena gave a small motion with her hand towards the mineshaft that was 
supposed to be the &#39;ruins&#39;. &quot;So...these are the ruins, then? You wanted 
to take a look around there? Well with Lady Arisugawa and myself 
present, your safety shall be insured. If you still wanted to take a 
peek inside, I ask that you let us go with you first. Who knows what 
sort of poisonous gases or dangerous cave-ins there might be in there. 
What could possibly be so interesting about a hole in a ground?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to go in there. I&#39;d hate to get my 
boots filthy.&quot;

Utena looked to Juri who at the moment seemed bored. Anthy was going 
through her saddlebags and produced a couple of lanterns. &quot;The men who 
discovered these ruins said they saw the marks of Dios within. They left 
in a hurry, afraid of divine punishment. But if one of the divine were 
with us, I&#39;m certain we&#39;d be alright.&quot; She gave Utena a meaningful look. 
Utena caught the look and then, after a moment, understood finally what 
Anthy was getting at. If these ruins were old enough...there might be 
clues as to what happened to her homeland two thousand years ago.

Utena felt her interest rising as she took a step behind Anthy and 
leaned her face into the darkness. The air within smelled stale and 
earthy. It tunneled into the ground at an angle, curving with the slope 
of the man-made path. Running a hand along the wooden beams that kept 
the roof from caving in, the cyborg ran an optics check and judged them 
to be sound. Turning back to the others, she found Juri and Wakaba 
standing somewhat apart and on either side.

&quot;Alright. We&#39;ll just take a short look around. If this really is 
an...err...holy place of Dios, I want to take a look at it. So I&#39;ll go 
in first and Lady Arisugawa can take the rear. I&#39;ll also monitor the air 
quality as we descend.&quot; The others nodded, and the two swordswomen in 
the group checked to make sure their weapons were loose. But as Utena 
moved to head inside the cave, they found themselves with a small 
problem.

CLUNK

Three pairs of eyes widened as Utena found herself stuck in the doorway. 
She wriggled a bit, her massive spiked armor caught in the narrow beams 
of the shaft. Twisting she pulled herself out and tried to turn a 
different way.

CLUNK

And promptly got stuck again.

Anthy blinked as Utena swore colorfully under her breath and pried 
herself out a second time. Juri tapped her chin and gave a small shrug. 
&quot;My. I suppose your armor is too broad to make it through. Shall we head 
back instead?&quot;

&quot;I can get through this door, Lady Arisugawa!&quot;

&quot;Of course of course, holy one.&quot; She sounded amused, much to Utena&#39;s 
chagrin.

&quot;Ummm...can&#39;t you just leave your armor behind?&quot;

&quot;For the bandits to find, Lady Shinohara?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s fine. Her majesty made these little charms that keep away 
bandits.&quot;

&quot;Charms?&quot;

Anthy gave a small start and glared at Wakaba, who chuckled nervously. 
Feeling Utena&#39;s gaze she gave a small shrug and turned her eyes to enjoy 
the scenic view of the tall grass. &quot;More of that...ah, magick I was 
telling you about. Our things shall be safe in this clearing, Guardian.&quot; 
Utena pursed her lips and mulled over this information. Well...as much 
as she didn&#39;t really trust all this magick business, her augmented 
hearing and abilities would inform her if anyone stumbled onto their 
things. And thanks to the sensor chips placed within her ectosuit and 
her spinal cord, no matter where it was she&#39;d always be able to locate 
it. It should be all right for a little while...although being without 
her precious armor made her feel naked.

&quot;Hmm. Very well. Please stand back.&quot; The group of women gave her some 
space as Utena stood to her full height. Punching in the key code on her 
chest plate, the rose symbol gave a glow and the suit split apart in a 
hiss of steam. Juri raised her hands protectively and watched in awe as 
a smaller and more slender figure climbed out of the massive armor. When 
the steam dissipated with the wind, the orange haired woman found 
herself gazing at a vision. A vision in breeches...

Utena dusted herself off and unhooked the sword belt from around her 
armor as it pieced itself together again. It looked like a headless 
statue, shining there in the sunlight. Strapping the belt on her own 
waist, the robotic woman found it to be a little larger and longer. 
Things were different at this height. Turning to the others as she blew 
a loose curl out of her face, Utena gestured to the mineshaft once more. 
&quot;Shall we go?&quot; Anthy smiled and handed her one of the lanterns, as the 
four of them began to move underground.

Several minutes after the four had disappeared, leaving their horses 
tethered safely outside, a crow flapped down from the sky and landed on 
one of the saddles. Blinking its beady eye as its head twisted from side 
to side, it gave a series of hops and flapped its wings at the saddle 
horn. Then it began pecking at the red string that held Anthy&#39;s woven 
charm together. With a snap the thread came apart on the sharp beak, 
scattering tiny glass colored beads to the dust below. The crow flapped 
its wings to the second saddle and did the same. When both protective 
charms had broken and fallen away, the large black crow gave a throaty 
croak and took to the sky again.

&quot;Watch your head, the ceiling dips here.&quot; Utena said as she bent low to 
duck under a crevice. The underground tunnel echoed with the scuffs of 
boot heels. Every now and then, the pink-haired knight of Dios would 
turn back to check on her charges as she led them further and further 
into the underworld. It always gave Anthy shivers when she saw those 
blue eyes in the darkness. Bleeding their electric fire and leaving 
faint motion trails when she turned her head. They seemed...at home in 
such a gloomy place.

Anthy for her part wasn&#39;t idle. Though nothing really showed outwardly, 
she was digging deep within her being and extending her inner witch 
magick out into the stone and earth around them. Like invisible fingers 
poking and sifting about for something...anything... But all she could 
feel around her was...metal? She opened her mouth to comment on it and 
ended up speaking in sync with Utena:

&quot;We&#39;re surrounded by steel.&quot;

They both looked at each other for a moment surprised, while Juri raised 
her lantern to illuminate their faces. Utena went on for them both.

&quot;We are underground...however...my sensors are picking up traces of 
steel all around us. This is not simply a naturally made cavern. This 
cavern was once man-made.&quot;

Wakaba looked confused. &quot;Man-made?&quot;

Utena smiled and nodded at them, her blue eyes flashing brighter before 
dimming. &quot;Yes. Where I am originally from...our buildings and machines 
were all made of steel and glass.&quot; Wakaba&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Everything 
was powered by nuclear energy and electricity even in the poorest 
sectors. And some of our towers and &#39;castles&#39; extended up above the 
clouds themselves.&quot;

Juri looked at her, her head cocking to the side. &quot;You truly 
are...something not of this earth. What you describe sounds simply 
amazing! Why have you been sent to earth though? Why has Dios sent you 
to us now?&quot;

Utena trained her eyes on the swordswoman, pausing in thought for a 
moment before she spoke. Her words were careful...as if hiding 
something, the Arisugawa clanswoman noted.

&quot;My coming here...was not entirely of my will. I wasn&#39;t intended to 
sleep for as long as I did. Something must have happened back...home. 
But my programming is hardwired into my very skull, and I know my 
purpose here. Even though the situation has changed...drastically...on 
my honor I will still obey my Prince&#39;s command.&quot; Utena&#39;s eyes looked 
away, her tone becoming self-mocking. &quot;Dios&#39; will be done.&quot;

The cyborg reached out a hand to halt them as the tunnel opened up into 
a wide chamber. There were many broken stone steps that jutted out of 
the wall and wound down unevenly to a floor down below. Juri cast her 
eyes upward. There were strange railing and beams jutting out above, 
just barely visible by the faint light cast from the lanterns. The walls 
held massive square projections like paintings, but whatever had once 
been on them was now long since gone. There was a rose insignia larger 
than life cast out of rust covered metal, that filled an entire back 
wall. There seemed to be...glyphs...or words underneath it...but she 
couldn&#39;t understand the language, and some of the letters appeared 
missing. Curious she turned her gaze to Utena, who had gone strangely 
still. Anthy turned too and watched the mechanical knight.

Her chest didn&#39;t rise and fall beneath her doublet. Her body didn&#39;t sway 
even lightly from the precarious position she took on the edge of the 
walkway. Juri might have been cautious standing so close to the edge, 
they were really high up apparently. But the other woman didn&#39;t even 
notice. Her eyes were glued onto the rose crest, every muscles still as 
a snake. Anthy stood just behind her, her hair and dressed stuck to her 
from perspiration.

&quot;Lady Guardian?&quot; The pony-tailed woman didn&#39;t respond. Anthy tried again 
a little louder.

&quot;Sir...Tenjou?&quot; Juri noted the name distantly, but was too rapt in 
attention to pay it any real heed. Carefully the princess reached out to 
touch the taller woman on the shoulder, her voice worried.

&quot;Utena? Utena are you alright?&quot;

At the touch, Utena seemed to come back to life. She twitched into more 
of a slouch, and her shoulders moved slightly as she took a breath. 
Blinking she turned to Anthy with a smile. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, did you say 
something? I didn&#39;t hear you, princess.&quot;

&quot;Ah...is everything alright?&quot; Anthy asked, still concerned over the 
behavior of her protector. Utena gave a small wave of her hand in 
dismissal.

&quot;But of course. I am fine. Shall we descend?&quot; There were some backward 
glances and some scuffing of feet. But hesitantly the party slowly moved 
along the stone platform to its edge, and prepared to head down the 
spiraling stairs. They moved slowly and with care, the darkness moist 
from underground humidity. Wakaba was shaking slightly as she reached 
out a foot to feel the ground beneath her. The steps were bumpy, and 
came at odd intervals as if they&#39;d broken off with time. What had this 
place once been? A sacred shrine to Dios? Was it really okay for them to 
be here? Looking ahead of the line, she could make out the severe 
profile of Lady Utena&#39;s face. She seemed focused and intense, her creepy 
blue eyes glowing brighter to provide a pair of beaming lights to help 
them see the steps.

It was strange. At first the Guardian didn&#39;t seem interested in being 
there. Now it was she that seemed to lead the expedition, with Anthy 
trailing behind her. Wakaba supposed that secretly getting a present to 
give the holy knight wasn&#39;t a possibility now. But perhaps the trip 
would do instead? That Arisugawan woman didn&#39;t look to be too at home 
here... Wakaba turned and glanced back at the swordswoman over her 
shoulder. Juri&#39;s eyes were constantly scanning the darkness, and she 
seemed to be staying well away from the edge. Well, it served her right. 
Wakaba didn&#39;t like her sort, so even if it was mean she enjoyed seeing 
the normally impassive aristocrat off her mark.

When they reached the halfway point of the spiral, a loud crack made all 
of them freeze. The stone slab they were standing on gave a lurch, and 
with a cry Anthy and Wakaba began to slide sideways. Utena, on a lower 
step, gave a cry of alarm and reached out to snag them. Juri dropped her 
lantern and made to grab blindly at the girl&#39;s hands, suddenly being 
pulled off balance herself. With a cry the four women fell into the 
darkness below...

Ruka was starting to feel frantic. The stately Baron had gone to see if 
he might commune with the Right Hand of Dios, hoping to catch her some 
time during the noonday meal. However, her holiness was not to be found. 
So Ruka instead decided to see if he might call on Anthy instead. Ah, 
Princess Anthy. Of course. But her majesty did not seem to be in 
residence either. And now he had just received a report from one of his 
men that one of the High Council members was not in attendance. Juri 
Arisugawa was the worrying factor indeed. She was the representative to 
the Arisugawan nation, but was also scheduled to be at a meeting with 
two clan chiefs from the eastern borders later that night! Three of the 
most powerful key players were not here, and Ruka had no idea what to do 
about it.

But he kept level head. Surely the Guardian hadn&#39;t...hadn&#39;t gone back to 
heaven. Surely there would have been some notification first. And 
besides, wasn&#39;t her holiness supposed to bring peace and everlasting 
prosperity to their kingdom? So no. There had to be another reason for 
their absence. And if Anthy was gone, then the Holy Guardian was most 
likely with her. Had the Arisugawan noble taken them somewhere? Ruka 
never did trust those forest mongrels...

&quot;My lord baron, the report you requested is here.&quot; A page left a sealed 
document on the elaborate wooden table where Ruka did his work. The 
blue-haired man waved off the page, who bowed and exited the room. 
Breaking the wax seal, Ruka scanned the page. The soldiers&#39; reports were 
simple. They didn&#39;t have a reason for why they weren&#39;t at their 
posts...only that for some reason they had all found themselves 
wandering away from the main castle gates. A couple of horses were 
missing from the stables, reported the stable master. They had been 
taken by a servant girl, who had had them loaded with supplies for a 
day&#39;s short ride. Juri Arisugawa&#39;s horse was reported missing as well, 
checked out earlier that day.

Ruka mulled his thoughts over a cup of wine, as he continued reading. 
His investigations had at least turned up some good news. Most likely 
the missing women would be back by nightfall. At least he could only 
hope so...the king would not be happy if they weren&#39;t... Ruka sighed and 
massaged his eyes, with a hand that sparkled with rings and jewels. He 
still needed to read over the recent message sent from the outlands. 
Some of the masterless mercenaries and homeless villagers were looking 
for entry to the Tsuchiya lands. Recent attacks by bandits had been 
increasing more and more, leaving razed villages and blood soaked fields 
in their wake.

Sighing, Ruka sat back in his chair, gazing up at the carved ceiling. 
He&#39;d need to try and negotiate land for the survivors, and test the new 
warriors. His lands were getting crowded, with no room to expand...but 
could he leave them to die? As a baron and a leader, it was his duty to 
see to all the needs of his people and think of the greater good. But he 
couldn&#39;t afford to raise the taxes any more than he already had... He 
would need to petition for more of an allowance from the king. Touching 
the thick golden chain around his neck, he lifted up the rose medallion 
to his nose, turning it over to look at the holy mark of Dios on its 
back. The mark always lay over its wearer&#39;s heart, due to its 
construction. Reminding the kingdom&#39;s nobles to remember their faith in 
all that they did. Ruka smiled at it sadly, placing a gentle kiss on it 
before setting it back down.

Hopefully things would get better soon. With the Guardian here at 
Ohtori, it was all he could pray for...

Anthy groaned painfully as she slowly came to. Slowly opening her eyes, 
she found she couldn&#39;t see a thing. She blinked a few more times, and 
lifted a hand to her face to check that they really were open. Nothing. 
It was all blackness... Wincing, Anthy felt a bump on her hairline just 
above her ear. Where were they? Was she still alive? Trying to sit up, 
the dark woman felt about her sightlessly as she tried to determine just 
what had happened. She remembered...falling...Utena reaching out to 
catch her...then being crushed against between bodies as Utena reached 
out to grab Wakaba and Juri as well. Then...nothing...she must have 
fainted.

There was something underneath her that shifted slightly when she 
touched it, making Anthy give a fearful start. Heart hammering, the 
princess felt along it until she felt it connect to something larger. A 
chest breathing in and out. It was someone&#39;s arm. Scared but relieved to 
know she wasn&#39;t alone. Leaning over the person, Anthy tried shaking them 
gently. Hopefully they weren&#39;t seriously hurt. They stirred slightly, 
and gave a low mutter as their arm shifted away into the darkness. Anthy 
leaned closer, helping them to sit up.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Fine..I&#39;m...I&#39;m alright. I just seemed to have bruised my ribs.&quot;

The voice belonged to Juri. Anthy sat back away from her, surprised. 
Where were the others? Juri seemed to echo her thoughts.

&quot;Where are the Guardian and the servant girl? I can&#39;t see a damned 
thing. I lost my lantern.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Anthy replied. She closed her eyes and concentrated a 
moment, willing the amulet around her neck to life. It started to glow 
softly, the faint light softening the shadows and bringing their two 
bodies more into focus. Juri regarded her with a small sneer.

&quot;Glad to see you&#39;re never without your little tricks even with your new 
station, Princess.&quot;

Anthy regarded her coolly. &quot;Of course not. If anything, I&#39;ll need them 
all the more.&quot;

Juri gave a small smile and a nod of acceptance. &quot;Naturally.&quot;

Climbing to her feet, the swordsman checked her belt to find her rapier 
still attached and held out a hand to help Anthy to her feet. Anthy 
ignored the offered hand and got up on her own. The two remained silent, 
ignoring each other as each looked out to try and seek out the two 
missing members of the party. In the distance, the sound of strange 
hissing could be heard. Glancing at one another, Juri drew her blade and 
took a step forward protectively. Something seemed to spark blue in the 
darkness. As it came closer, a pair of eyes could be made out, and 
finally they relaxed as Utena walked to them, cradling Wakaba in her 
arms. Setting the maid down, the cyborg motioned them to follow her.

&quot;I found a power generator that hasn&#39;t corroded all the way yet. We 
should be able to get some lights in here.&quot; Following her, Anthy noticed 
that little blue sparks, similar to lightning, were hissing from her 
right leg. The breeches were torn, she saw in the flickering light, and 
it looked as though Utena had been...wounded!

&quot;Guardian, you&#39;re hurt! Are you alright? What can we do to help?&quot; Anthy 
touched Utena on her arm to get her to pause a moment. Turning to her 
Utena patted her hand to ease her concern.

&quot;Not to worry, its a small thing. I shall be fit in no time, your 
majesty.&quot;

&quot;But your leg...&quot;

&quot;Poor landing on my part. I missed the grate and ended up kicking into a 
wall. It&#39;s already healing, though. Come. Nothing can be done in all 
this darkness. Here, Lady Arisugawa. Kindly hold onto my sword for a 
bit. Wakaba, will you hand me that piece of metal cable over there? The 
one that looks like a brown stick? Yes that. Thank you.&quot;

The pink haired knight picked up the bit of metal and a piece of broken 
stone, and began to scrape off the rust. As she worked, her eyes blazed 
brightly to provide a moving set of blue beams over her work area, 
lighting up the group&#39;s surroundings even more. Anthy gazed about her in 
fascination at the tall marble columns and the weird metal structures. 
They had fallen to the very bottom, and were now underneath the rose on 
the back wall. Its massive size dwarfed them causing a small flutter of 
nervousness in Wakaba, who thought that the metal-wrought giant might 
fall on them at any moment. The sound of stone scraping on metal ceased, 
and Utena stood. Moving behind one of the metal structures, they could 
hear a clatter and a metallic tearing, as the cyborg ripped off the 
faceplate to the generator, and tossed it over her shoulder. Fiddling 
with the insides of the big power source, she concentrated on repairing 
the broken connections.

Everyone jumped, even Utena herself, as a loud grinding sound 
reverberated from the large metal box and echoed along the vast walls of 
the cavern. The box began to hum loudly and vibrate, shaking in its 
steel fastenings. Utena took a step back, waiting as the dying generator 
at last rumbled to life. Overhead a handful of large globular crystals 
began to flicker on, bathing the ground in circles of white fluorescent 
light. The glass was dirty, from years of dust and decay. And over half 
of them were broken. But Utena smiled at the astounded comments of 
&#39;Amazing!&#39; and &#39;Incredible&#39; that came from the other three women. This 
was her kind of magick.

Leading the four of them to a side hall, Utena spoke aloud as they 
walked. &quot;I recognize this place, despite the damage and weathering. We 
stand in one of the media headquarters, where news was broadcasted 
across the country to our citizens. It&#39;s military owned, so it usually 
aired news about the current war and political announcements from Prince 
Dios.&quot; Although she knew she had probably lost them, Utena couldn&#39;t seem 
to stop herself from speaking. Her tone becoming more excited and 
animate. &quot;So if any place would have news about the past, it&#39;d be here. 
I&#39;m sure there are still the old data cubes in the main records 
department, even if I can&#39;t get some of the computers to work. My lady, 
kindly watch your step.&quot; Utena ushered Wakaba past some sparking wires 
that were snaking out of one wall and were lying limp on the ground. &quot;We 
need to move quickly. I&#39;m thankful that the generator is working after 
all of this time, but I am doubtful to how long that will last.&quot;

&quot;So lead on. Let&#39;s head to this...area you spoke of. Let&#39;s find what you 
wish to seek, so that we may begin testing our luck on getting out of 
here.&quot; Juri&#39;s voice sounded strained.

Utena regarded her curiously. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Juri gave a small 
shrug, her voice tight.

&quot;My people...live under the open forest canopy. We do not do so well 
underground in dark places. I find this place unsettling.&quot; Anthy glanced 
over at the swordswoman with a small interest. She hadn&#39;t known the 
details about Juri&#39;s aversion of dark underground places...only knew 
that the Council member rarely went Below to the second castle of 
Ohtori.

&quot;I see...why don&#39;t you tell me a bit about your people while we walk. It 
should help you keep your mind off of things.&quot; Juri paused in her 
footsteps, her face showing some surprise. &quot;My...people?&quot; Utena turned 
and gave a nod.

&quot;Certainly. I know next to nothing about them. And who better to ask?&quot; 
Juri frowned slightly, her expression guarded. &quot;Is that alright?&quot; Utena 
asked quietly. The group came to a halt around the two of them.

&quot;No...it&#39;s quite alright, Lady Guardian. It&#39;s just that...no one has 
ever asked me before. Most of my people don&#39;t follow Dios...or any 
gods...So we&#39;re not usually worth regard.&quot;

Utena gave a shrug and a small smile. &quot;That doesn&#39;t really bother me. 
And I&#39;m sure Dios won&#39;t mind.&quot; Wakaba&#39;s eyes bulged as she looked back 
and forth between the two of them. Was the Guardian allowed to say 
that?! Was she in such close connection to their god?! Maybe Wakaba 
shouldn&#39;t have wore that little black dress the other night when she 
snuck into Utena&#39;s room, after all...

Juri gave a small smile, the corners of her eyes creasing a bit as she 
nodded formally. &quot;Very well then, holy one.&quot; Utena nodded and turned on 
her boot heel, ponytail swishing. And after a short time the four sets 
of footsteps were broken by the sound of Juri&#39;s low voice rising and 
falling as she spoke of rich mountain streams, colorful forest birds, 
hunting game on foot through ancient trails, and the celebrations her 
people had to worship the spirit of the woods. Utena kept half an ear on 
her, the rest of her attention put to navigating the corridors of the 
buried building. After reading the faded signs on the walls, Utena lead 
them to a green door. The paint was peeling off in many places, and the 
hinges had rusted shut. Giving a powerful kick, the knight made door 
shudder in place. Another kick caused it to crash inward, raining a 
cloud of dust from the ceiling.

Taking a step into the room, Utena held up a hand as she went in first. 
&quot;Allow me to check it first.&quot; She was gone a moment, as the others 
waited. They looked about themselves in the dim lighting of the track 
lighting buzzing above them. Then the pink haired woman&#39;s voice from 
within drew them inside.

&quot;It&#39;s safe. This seems to be it. Let&#39;s hurry and see what we can find.&quot; 
As they approached, they could see Utena&#39;s legs sticking out from 
underneath a long metal desk of sorts. Her leg was no longer sparking, 
having repaired a great deal of its own damage. She muttered to herself 
and kept working underneath. Finally, a large...painting of sorts...(or 
was it a window?) began to glow and show a picture of landscape.

It was a vast city, the likes Anthy could only dream about. People were 
walking about in strange clothes, chariots zoomed across the sky on 
bright ribbons of light and air, the towers and houses seemed to climb 
like fingers towards the sky. The image flickered and the face of a 
woman filled the view screen, making Anthy and Wakaba jump and Juri 
tense in fear. Her lips moved silently for a moment, until Utena crawled 
out from underneath the control panel and began pushing down buttons. 
Suddenly sound blared out at them, bouncing off the walls and clanging 
painfully on their ears. The cyborg adjusted the settings and it was 
reduced to a tolerable level.

&quot;--And the new drug will be available at all pharmaceutical stations in 
the Hadron Quarter, lowered at a new affordable rate for citizen 
purchase. The Abraxas Corporation continues to make new strides towards 
helping create a happier, healthier humanoid! And now for the evening 
news, our first story--&quot;

Utena adjusted the information feed request, banging on the top of the 
machine several times to get it to function properly. The woman 
flickered away, and was replaced by a few different faces and images. 
Anthy watched silently, unable to look away. Visions of fighting, or 
dying men, and huge explosions swept across the screen along with grave 
faced generals and important looking people. Strange flying contraptions 
roared across a blood red sky, raining down pellets of fire at armored 
suits down on the ground. At last, the images halt as Utena seemed to 
find the one she wanted. A man in a black and gold suit smiled at the 
camera as his voice carried through the room.

&quot;And now citizens, during this trying time, may I present to you our 
most glorious ruling father. The man who has been protecting you from 
the scourge of the infidel terrorists and intruders, who&#39;ve been 
attacking our borders. His royal highness, Prince Dios.&quot;

The man stepped out of the way, to reveal a composed individual standing 
at a podium. Military insignia dripped from his uniform coat, his darker 
skin striking against the tan and black. Ranged behind him were armored 
figures that somewhat resembled Utena&#39;s armor. Although they looked less 
impressive.

&quot;My beloved citizens...its is grave news that I must bear today...&quot; His 
voice was rolling and smooth, youthful sounding despite his status. But 
as soon as his face came on screen, Wakaba gave a small shriek and fell 
to her hands and knees. Anthy too, hands clasped over her heart, quickly 
ducked down and bowed her head. Even Juri, who had often professed not 
to be a follower of the &#39;ridiculous religion&#39;, was too overwhelmed not 
to kneel reverently. This was the face of their god, his voice touching 
their ears with its tranquility and seriousness. Wakaba&#39;s lips moved in 
silent prayer, her eyes squeezed shut. Anthy couldn&#39;t seem to stop from 
shaking, as Dios kept on speaking. Every now and then his voice would 
become garbled as the lights from the screen and from the hall dimmed 
and flickered.

But finally, as Dios continued speaking, and no bolts of lightning or 
torrents of fire seemed to rain down on them, Anthy gained the courage 
to peek to her left. She saw Juri&#39;s face upturned, glued to the front of 
them. Hesitantly, her breaths loud in her own ears, Anthy turned to look 
as well.

There Utena stood, one hand extended to gently touch the screen. Her 
eyes were locked onto the moving image of Dios, as he spoke of a &#39;weapon 
of great destruction&#39;. Anthy squinted her eyes, and widened them 
when...she saw tears slowly roll down Utena&#39;s cheeks. A painful 
wrenching squeezed the princess&#39; heart as she watched them roll 
unheeded. Dio&#39;s image was flickering badly, jarring Utena out of her 
trance. Frantically she began slapping at the control panel, trying to 
get it to remain. But the limited power that had brought it all to life 
was now fading.

Dio&#39;s final words were haunting, as Anthy found the courage to stand and 
make her way over to Utena. Her steps slow and sluggish as she fought 
her every instinct to flee the room.

&quot;My children...my people...for those who will not evacuate our 
city...for those who--krrrrt--remember this isn&#39;t the--krrrrt--we will 
not die without a figh--krrrrt--this nuclear strike will spark a 
major--krrrrt--in the hearts of our loved ones, we will live 
on--krrrrt--you can forgive me. I have nothing but pride and love for 
our country, and the men and women 
who--krrrrt--don&#39;t&quot;--krrrrrRRRRRRRRRT!!

The screen flickered and a strange video image popped up, making Utena 
tear her blurry eyes away from the controls. It was a poor footage, 
bouncing with the cameraman&#39;s running steps, up marble and carpeted 
steps that were on fire in places. Charred ash and smoke billowed and 
obscured the screen, and when it cleared a host of wounded KITBOTS 
clanked around the corner, swarmed around injured officials. In the 
center, carried on a pair of shoulders, was a wounded and bleeding Dios. 
His face was coated in blood, his lavender hair matted and scorched. A 
killing wound in his side forced him to breath with painful shallow 
breaths. As the camera zoomed in and panned wildly back and forth, Utena 
watched in rage and pain as several R-Tanks blew up several feet away. 
The sky was black with fighter jets, which dropped bombs and gunfire 
from the heavens. A building nearby was hit, and the shell shrapnel took 
out half the robotic guard. The camera whizzed back onto Dios who was 
yelling above the scream of sirens.

&quot;Get those men back to--krrrrt--west side! What?!&quot; Someone was yelling 
in his ear. Angrily he shook the man off. &quot;What do you 
mean--krrrt--is--krrrrrrrt--on lockdown?! On whose 
authority?!--krrrrt--The new--krrrrt--Guardian is still--krrt-- recovery 
from--krrrrrrt--structural surgery!&quot; Dios turned his face and saw the 
camera.

&quot;Get that man out of here!--krrrrrt--You!--krt--Head 
to--krrt--evacuation pod!&quot; Dios gave a cry of pain as he hunched his 
shoulders in pain. The view screen flickered off and on. Finally, with a 
low hum that rumbled down the hall, the lights faded to black once more 
and the view screen died away to nothing. Utena stood there, staring 
blankly at the screen. Her expression had shut down to a blankness that 
tightly hid everything away. She had to be strong. It was how she was 
raised. Weakness was intolerable. To show emotion in the face of 
adversity was to admit failure. This meant nothing. This didn&#39;t mean 
anything to her. This didn&#39;t hurt...

She felt a pair of soft warm arms curl around her shoulders and draw her 
in close. Unable to hold it back anymore, Utena lost it. Sagging into 
Anthy&#39;s embrace, Utena&#39;s shoulders began shaking as she covered her face 
in her hands. The two of them sank to their knees, as Utena sobbed. Even 
now...even now she couldn&#39;t stop herself from trying to hide it. The 
room was pitch black again, but she didn&#39;t care anymore. Dios...Dios was 
lost to her! Her home...her life...her love was all lost to her! She 
would never go back, she would never see people she once knew! She was 
alone and forgotten in a world that was little better than the Stone 
Age...

Anthy shifted a bit as she felt Utena turn into her and hold onto her 
shoulder weakly, tears soaking wetly through the fabric of her traveling 
dress. Anthy smoothed her hair, murmuring comforting words, as Utena 
wept for a world lost centuries before she was born.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Hey! T&#39;ain&#39;t it nice for dem folks to leaves us all dhese goodies?&quot; A 
burly man wielding a double-bladed axe nudged his smaller companion as 
they walked around the suit of armor. The other man grinned toothily, 
most of his mouth full of holes and rot. The party of bandits numbered 
around 10, had finished looting the horses and goods, and were now 
trying to figure out how to unpiece the shining pretty armor standing in 
the clearing. If it seemed odd that someone would leave all their 
precious things sitting out in the open, it didn&#39;t cross their minds.

As one man rubbed his greasy fingers across the silver markings and 
glyphs on its surface, he left a streak of dirt. It was at that moment 
that some of the men felt a shiver of impending doom touch their spines. 
From the mouth of the cave, there came a sound. It was followed by more 
sounds, nearly like something heavy was taking long laborious steps. Or 
maybe something was hopping around. Drawing their swords, they formed a 
tight ring and waited for whatever was heading their way.

A pair of blue pinpricks grew brighter, as a woman with pink hair 
stepped out into the opening. She was closely followed by three more who 
all looked agitated to various degrees. The pony tailed one in the men&#39;s 
clothes however, seemed doll-like. Not pausing in her strides, she drew 
her sword and walked towards the bandits.

The men jeered and began swiping the air with their swords. &quot;Oy girly, 
wut you thinkin&#39; you be--&quot; Began one. But he was cut off by the quiet 
words of the woman who was looking at the smudge on the armor. She also 
seemed to be looking around for the missing horses and gear.

&quot;Stealing is upsetting. Why are you trying to upset me?&quot; Her words were 
a little dazed and distant, as if she wasn&#39;t really focused on her 
surrounding danger. One of the men on foot moved to roughly grab her by 
the arm. In a split second later he was squealing in pain as his severed 
hand arced bloodily through the air. She now had a sword drawn, but no 
one...not even Juri has seen her draw it.

&quot;U-Utena!&quot;

&quot;Princess please stand back. I&#39;m not in a tolerating mood today.&quot; Her 
words were lazy and fuddled. Like a shock victim, Utena would surmise 
later. Without thought, her body moved in among the yelling bandits, 
their blades and arrows slicing the air. Her sword moved like water, 
Anthy saw. In horror she watched as Utena effortlessly cut a horse in 
half, and just barely sidestepped the flood of gore as it tipped over. 
Body parts and heads flew, as blood painted the grass and dirt. In just 
a few breaths it was over. And Utena was standing there dully in a ring 
of death. Her face never changed, her body was barely exerted. Giving a 
quick swipe onto a fallen cowl, Utena detachedly cleaned her blade and 
sheathed it. Without looking back she motioned for the others to get the 
horses.

&quot;...Let&#39;s head back. This is enough adventure for one day...&quot;

Without waiting she got back inside her suit of armor and began clanking 
back in the direction of the castle.

Anthy stood there, motionless watching her retreating back. Looking down 
at her hands she squeezed her eyes shut to hold back her tears. Why had 
she ever thought to come here? All it did was cause more pain...all she 
ever did was cause other people pain... Wakaba silently brought the 
horses over, her head bowed and her mouth silenced for once. Juri 
watched Utena for a moment, before she too mounted up and began the 
journey home.

It was nighttime when the guards nudged one another awake as a small 
party of horses made their way unfaltering towards the castle. Alongside 
them was tall armored figure in white, whose blue flaming eyes seemed 
colder tonight. Behind her was the Princess Anthy and the Lady Juri, 
followed by a servant girl. All seemed moody. When they dismounted 
outside the main entrance, stable boys coming to take their mounts, they 
paused below the steps. Utena looked back at them, her face looking 
tired and conflicted.

&quot;I would thank you all...to keep what happened today a secret between 
only we four. What you saw...where we were. I don&#39;t want it spoken of 
within the castle or town.&quot; Utena looked away, crossing her armored 
arms. Everyone nodded in agreement, Wakaba curtsying and murmuring about 
going to see to their rooms and baths. Anthy looked at Utena sadly for a 
moment, clearly wanting to say something. But instead she bowed her head 
and walked up into the castle steps.

As Utena turned to follow her, Juri grabbed her arm halting her. As 
Utena turned to question, she was quite suddenly tugged downward into a 
kiss. Juri had her eyes closed, standing on tiptoes, with one hand 
cradling Utena&#39;s cheek. As she released the armored woman from the kiss, 
her eyes smoldered. Utena, blushing touched her lips in surprise.

&quot;W-What are...?&quot;

Juri gave a small smirk, and looked down as she tugged off her riding 
gloves. &quot;Everyone here reveres you as a god. Believes you to be 
completely different from any mortal. And you are...however...&quot; Juri 
gave a small wink as she sashayed past, heading up the steps to the 
palace proper. Her last words were called over her shoulder just before 
she disappeared.

&quot;I&#39;m a practicing atheist.&quot;

The moon hung like a sickle in the sky, casting a cool ray of light 
through the window. Reclined on her back, still fully dressed, Utena was 
staring at the ceiling. Visions of Dio&#39;s smiling face played themselves 
out in her mind. His laughter, his words, his cries of pain rang in her 
ears. Over and over she could see him standing there, bleeding out as 
the sky fell atop his capitol. Her lips burned from the kiss of an 
aquamarine eyed swordswoman, whose wits and words were as sharp as her 
sword. She could still feel the ghostly sensation of that calloused hand 
softly caressing her cheek.

God...how long had it been? How long had it been since she&#39;d felt 
another&#39;s touch? Not since that time...she could still remember Dio&#39;s 
gentle touch as they kissed on the rooftop of one of the military 
hangars. Thoughts of Dios made her heart ache. Why was that? Wasn&#39;t her 
heart now a ticking cybernetic core? Made of metal and lifeless? Why did 
it hurt so much to remember the man who had once made up her world?

But oddly...as Utena lay there, counting the dents in the painted murals 
on her ceiling, feeling her lips tingle from a stolen kiss by another 
woman...she began to think of Anthy. Anthy was...her charge. A young 
woman from a time so far removed from her own it was ridiculous. And 
yet...she bore such a strong resemblance to Dios. It went beyond the 
bloodline. It was their very personalities. The way the corners of her 
mouth would lift up first before she smiled...how she held her 
teacup...and that damned stubbornness that was punctuated with 
politeness. It made Utena smile to think about her, made her feel more 
alive and okay when Anthy was around. There was still too much 
instability in her own life. Too much that Utena didn&#39;t yet know or 
understand. But with the smaller woman by her side, her ground felt a 
little more solid.

Unable to continue laying there, feeling restless, Utena sat up and 
swung her legs over the side of the bed. She wasn&#39;t wearing her armor, 
feeling it to be too cumbersome and heavy tonight. Too much of a burden 
to bear right then. So on silent feet, she opened her door and padded 
down the hall to Anthy&#39;s room. Without really thinking about it, Utena 
let herself in and paced by the side of the large four-poster bed. The 
figure of the princess was curled up on her side, holding her pillow 
with one hand and the covers with the other. There were tear stains on 
her cheeks, Utena noticed as her eyes clicked through their lenses until 
her night vision came up. Leaning down to brush a curl away from her 
forehead, Utena watched fondly as Anthy shifted in her fitful sleep.

&quot;Goodnight Princess.&quot;

Leaning down, she placed a small kiss on the girl&#39;s temple, smoothing 
her hair down before exiting the room. When the door had closed, Anthy&#39;s 
eyes opened to stare at the wall across the room.

&quot;Your majesty, the device you requested is finished.&quot; Miki Kaoru, the 
court mage and genius inventor, gave a bow as he presented a small boxed 
object to the king. Akio was sitting sprawled gracefully across a padded 
wooden chair, as he lifted his hands to receive the device.

&quot;Excellent, Miki. Your work never ceases to amaze me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, your majesty.&quot;

&quot;Tell me...&quot; The king set the box on the table at his side and gestured 
kindly to the male twin in his silver and blue trimmed vest. &quot;Have you 
had a chance to meet with the Holy Guardian here at the palace?&quot;

Miki looked up, his eyes shining with honest excitement. &quot;No your 
majesty. But I have heard rumors...I thought that perhaps...I might take 
some time tomorrow to meet her for myself?&quot; The question was asked 
carefully. Akio smiled kindly giving a nod.

&quot;But of course. How could I deny anyone the chance to meet a goddess? 
You and your sister both have my permission to take a break from your 
work in the lower levels...have a day of it tomorrow and get some 
sunshine.&quot;

Miki beamed with pleasure, giving a hasty bow. &quot;Thank you your majesty! 
I certainly will!&quot; When the blue haired young man had left, Akio 
remained sitting in his chair. Presently a crow flew in the window and 
landed on the table. Hopping over to him, Akio stroked its crown of 
feathers fondly.

&quot;Mmmm yes...excellent work my pet. Our plans are beginning to come 
together quite nicely.&quot; The crow gave a loud caw, and then flew back out 
the window. Picking up the box once more, Akio began to laugh.</pre>
