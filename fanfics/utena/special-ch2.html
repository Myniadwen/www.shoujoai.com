<h1>A Special Case (part 2 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/special-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The evening found me wandering the trails near Uruhattan Falls, a 
place that I often came to think, to relax and sometimes just to watch 
people. I liked being asked to take pictures of people with their own 
cameras - it felt like I was part of their family or tour, for a 
minute. The falls were beautiful, especially as the weather had been 
so good, and this night there were few other people around. I sat on a 
bench and listened to the music of the falling water. I didn&#146;t notice 
my eyes were closed until they popped open at a loud noise nearby. 
Yawning, I sat up and stretched, drawing attention from the obatarian 
next me. She scowled and turned away. I mentally stuck my tongue out 
at her, and got up to take a walk and get the blood flowing. It had 
been a long day.

That afternoon, Nikki had handed me a manila envelope, thick with 
papers. She said it had been delivered about ten minutes previously, 
while I had been on the phone. I thanked her and after she had closed 
the office door, opened the envelope. Inside was an accordion folder 
with neatly labeled divisions, and a note folded into a handmade paper 
envelope. Nice local touch, I thought. The note was brief, and neatly 
written. 

Here is all the paperwork I have to date. The missing person&#146;s name is 
Tenjou Utena. Please call me if you have any questions.

Terse, to the point. I found myself liking Himemiya Anshi more and 
more. She certainly didn&#146;t beat around the bush &#150; and there aren&#146;t 
many women like that. She didn&#146;t look any older than I did, but her 
manner was that of a more mature, older woman &#150; one who has seen many 
things and isn&#146;t going to waste too much time on them. I wondered who 
she was and why she hadn&#146;t been able to find this friend of hers. She 
seemed to have considerable resources.

&quot;Tenjou Utena.&quot; The name meant nothing to me. I flipped open the 
portfolio cover and took out the first sheaf of papers. Birth records, 
early school records, athletic awards&#133;no scholarships or other awards 
of that nature. Transfer to private Ohtori Academy at age 14, 
graduation four years later. That completed her school portfolio. 
Everything nice, neat and tidy. It immediately put my hackles up.

The next sheaf was no less informative, no less useless. Tenjou had 
been orphaned at 3, spent some time at an orphanage, ran away once or 
twice. The last time, at the age of 6, she had been gone for nearly a 
week, and had been returned by a businessman named Kiryuu. His son had 
discovered the girl hidden in a local church. Shortly after that, she 
had been given to an aunt, her mother&#146;s sister, a corporate interior 
designer who traveled internationally. At 14, when she had transferred 
to Ohtori Academy, the aunt had moved to Amsterdam. They wrote 
sporadically, the correspondence tapering off after she moved. The 
last letter her aunt had written was in the file.

I am sorry that it has been so long since I last wrote. I haven&#146;t 
heard from you in a while. It&#146;s been so busy here! I had a big job in 
Paris - I told you about that in my last letter, and about Michel. We 
were married last month and as I hadn&#146;t heard from you, I thought I&#146;d 
better let you know &#150; I&#146;ve made arrangements to give you the apartment 
in Japan, as I&#146;ll be living here permanently. When you&#146;ve got yourself 
settled, write. I miss you all the time and want to know what you are 
doing now&#133;it&#146;s been so long since I heard from you.

It went on like that for a while. There was a follow up note appended 
to the aunt&#146;s letter, mentioning that my client had attempted to reach 
the aunt at her last known address and phone number, but was unable to 
do so. The woman had apparently faded away, like an apparition.

The next section was information pertaining to Tenjou&#146;s apartment, 
left to her by the aforementioned aunt. The apartment had never been 
used. Tenjou had never contacted the lawyers and although the rent was 
still being paid, the red tape associated with that payment made it 
impossible to trace the source of income. The trail petered out an 
offshore holding company based in the Cayman Islands. I stared at this 
for a while, wondering who the hell my client was, that she could 
access all these records &#150; and why they all ended so suddenly. I began 
to suspect foul play, but then, if that had been the case, why had 
nothing been reported to the police? Was it a Jane Doe case? Maybe 
Tobei could help me on this.

The final section was a rough collection of personal notes, names of 
contacts, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses. All 
the miscellany that Miss Himemiya had gathered in the course of her 
investigation. Several names popped out at me. Kiryuu came up a few 
times, I noticed. It had been a Kiryuu that found Tenjou when she had 
run away&#133;and had returned her to the orphanage. And that same boy had 
attended Ohtori when Tenjou had been there. Coincidence? I doubted it. 
I paged through the files and found a phone number. The date on the 
paper was less than 6 months ago, so I figured it was as good a place 
to start as any. Nice how my client had kept such meticulous records&#133; 
as I dialed my phone, I wondered again where I was being led.

Now, several hours and one appointment to see Kiryuu Touga tomorrow at 
16:00 later (assuming that my train to Tokyo was not delayed) and I&#146;d 
start putting together the mystery of the disappearance of Tenjou 
Utena. The light was beginning to fade as I left the noise of the 
Falls behind me, while my mind ran on ahead.
