<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 13 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/revolution-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Releena lay there patiently, the brown haired young
woman keeping her eyes shut as she waited for the
noises to gradually come to a halt. She was a bit
surprised to hear the soft murmur of Une and Juri&#39;s
conversation, the voices recognizable but the words
unclear. Finally when things were quiet and still she
slipped from her bed, dressing swiftly.

&#39;I know this is a bad idea,&#39; Releena admitted as she
silently slipped off down the hallway, &#39;but I just had
to get away for awhile, escape all of the secrets.&#39;

Her father had simply refused to explain what was
really going on, even though Releena was sure that he
knew more than he was telling. Colonel Une was simply
unapproachable, and not just because of her allegiance
to the Specials. Une had a cold, almost regal bearing
about her at times, one that prevented attempts at
making small talk. And Juri...

Releena scowled, the back stairs deserted as she took
the slower but safer way down to the street. Juri had
met her eyes then, the slightest of smiles appearing
on her face as they stood together in the hallway by
their rooms. &quot;I&#39;ll answer you&#39;re questions if you
want,&quot; Juri had said seriously, &quot;but be sure you
really want to know.&quot;

&quot;How can I make a decision like that,&quot; Releena
muttered to herself as she finally reached the street
level, &quot;if no one tells me anything?&quot; The light in the
colony had been dimmed for the night cycle and the
nearby road was deserted as Releena took a walk, lost
to her own thoughts until the honk of a horn
distracted her.

Hilde smiled gently, the young woman driving the limo
that she had first picked Releena and the others up
in. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she said as she flipped her
brown hair up out of her eyes, &quot;I have a passenger who
would like to speak with you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Releena asked, readying herself to run.

Seeing Releena&#39;s hesitation Hilde quickly added, &quot;I&#39;ll
guarantee your safety, and you can leave whenever
you&#39;re ready.&quot;

&#39;This is a very stupid idea,&#39; Releena thought as she
climbed inside. The interior was dim, and it took a
moment for her eyes to adjust and make the other
figure sitting there visible. He was an old man, his
hair long and gray with small, round glasses over his
eyes.

&quot;Good evening, Ms. Peacecraft,&quot; he said calmly, the
slightest of smiles on his face, &quot;my name is
unimportant, but you can call me Dr. J.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry sir, but you must have me confused with
someone else,&quot; Releena shook her head in honest
confusion.

Dr. J gestured, revealing that he had a artificial
hand and Hilde started the car up. &quot;You are of course
aware that you were adopted,&quot; he saw the blank look on
her face and sighed wearily before muttering to
himself, &quot;ah, the things we do to protect the young.&quot;

Releena tried to fight the feeling of vertigo she
felt, &#39;Adopted? Mother and father never said...&#39;

Taking a steadying breath she forced herself to speak,
&quot;Even assuming I believe you&#39;re telling the truth,
what does Peacecraft have to do with this?&quot;

He nodded, &quot;You&#39;ve read about the fall of the peace
loving nation of the Sank, and the betrayal that they
suffered.&quot;

&quot;They were supposed to have been colluding with the
colonies,&quot; Releena recalled the official story, &quot;and
the governments of Earth felt that they had to take
action.&quot;

&quot;The Peacecraft monarchy were great friends with our
leader Heero Yui,&quot; he sighed, &quot;but all they sought was
peace.&quot; He saw her surprise at the name Heero and
remarked, &quot;I see you have encountered my young charge,
he took the name in respect to the other man.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Releena murmured then she made them get back
on track by pointing out, &quot;But all the Peacecraft
family is dead.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he shook his head, &quot;the King and Queen died with
their nation, that is true, but the children were
rescued by trusted servants. The fate of the eldest
son remains a mystery, but we have found the
daughter....&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Releena made a face, &quot;it
sounds like something out of a bad drama. And you
expect me to believe that I&#39;m this lost daughter?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot; When she looked at him in surprise he
smiled, &quot;I merely expect you to consider what I&#39;ve
said, ask the right questions and accept the answers.&quot;
He reached into his pocket and drew something forth,
&quot;I also have a gift for you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s...&quot; Releena blinked in surprise as he dropped
the silver ring in her hand, the rose seal gleaming
scarlet in the dim light.

&quot;You are a player in this game,&quot; he said to her
seriously as the car slid to a stop back in front of
the hotel, the side door opening automatically, &quot;but
the role that you will choose is your own to decide.
Just pick it well.&quot;

A moment later Releena found herself standing in the
darkness watching the taillights quickly disappear in
the distance, her hand still firmly clutching the rose
signet she had just been given. &#39;Could it be true?&#39;
she wondered dazedly. She rushed upstairs, grateful
that she could slip into her room unnoticed then fell
into a restless sleep.

Back in the limo Hilde drove on silently for a moment
then she just had to ask him, &quot;Was that really a good
idea, sir?&quot;

&quot;Probably not. The attack on them was a surprise to
me,&quot; he softly admitted, &quot;and to the others in our
loose organization. If she is going to be at the
center of events young Miss Peacecraft needs to
understand the stakes and the role she could play.&quot;

&quot;Understood sir,&quot; Hilde said with a respectful nod as
she pulled over to pick up her replacement, &quot;I just
hope we don&#39;t regret this later.&quot;

&quot;As do I,&quot; he agreed.

Hilde got out of the car and walked back towards the
hotel, mentally preparing to return to her role as a
helpful local guide. &#39;I&#39;d better keep a close eye on
them,&#39; she thought, &#39;especially if whomever planted
that bomb takes another shot. Having a diplomat and OZ
colonel die here would not look good at all...&#39; Hilde
sighed, &#39;Were OZ really so willing to sacrifice their
own soldier, or is there a third party involved in our
little conflict?&#39;



Far away from the young lady&#39;s troubled thoughts fires
raged as explosions blossomed through the refueling
center in North America, flammable liquids quickly
reaching the ignition point. The armored figure
watched a moment, the twin guns mounted on it&#39;s arms
ready, then the lanky red and blue colored mobile suit
moved off.

&quot;Another mission completed,&quot; Trowa Barton murmured,
his brown hair falling oddly towards his remote eyes.
He was oddly expressionless as he moved off through
the wreckage of OZ suits, studying the monitors even
as he trudged on.

Text streamed across the glowing screen, detailing yet
another mission to the cold yet dangerously efficient
young pilot. A prototype mobile suit being tested,
technology that must be destroyed and also reasonably
nearby.

The Gundam called Heavyarms moved silently through the
night, concealing it&#39;s presence with surprising ease.
Trowa had learned well the conditions on Earth in the
past few weeks and knew how to use the features to his
fullest advantage. He had even found a job, as a
performer in a circus, one of the few distractions he
allowed himself from the task at hand.

&#39;Catherine,&#39; Trowa thought as the image of the knife
thrower appeared before his mind&#39;s eye, the beautiful
girl who treated him with such kindness. He made
himself clear his head as he muttered, &quot;There&#39;s work
to be done.&quot;

Concealing the Gundam in the forest he went on ahead
on foot, Trowa easily hiding his presence as he
carefully approached the target. Crawling forward
through damp earth he reached the top of a rise and
brought the binoculars to his eyes only to freeze in
surprise.

&quot;Gundams?!&quot; Trowa blurted softly.

A closer scan revealed all the differences, but Trowa
felt a chill in his bones. There weren&#39;t test models
that were patrolling outside the facility below him,
they were working models. One resembled a Leo, a
armored knight painted in black and red while the
other had a more elegant look, a larger shield unit
and a chain-unit attached to the arm.

&#39;They look like the Tallgeese that&#39;s been operating in
Europe,&#39; Trowa noted. &#39;I doubt they&#39;re built with
Gundanium,&#39; he thought as he recorded all the details
of the suits and the site that he could, &#39;but if their
performance is even close to our Gundams&#39; abilities I
don&#39;t dare rush in there on my own. I&#39;m going to need
help....&#39;

With that disturbing thought in mind Trowa slipped
away, racing to return to his Gundam in case the enemy
discovered it. &quot;Though even with it,&quot; he murmured, &quot;I
could be in trouble.&quot;</pre>
