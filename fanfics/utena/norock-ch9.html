<a href="../utena/norock-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Lost in Concerto

&quot;It&#39;s been over an hour and he still isn&#39;t here.&quot; Saionji was pacing 
anxiously in front of the rough brick wall of the club. Gathered about 
him, leaning against the wall and a parked car, Anthy, Juri, Wakaba and 
Shiori waited for Touga to reappear. One duelist&#39;s presence was 
noticeably absent. &quot;I don&#39;t like it. Miki has always been one for 
punctuality.&quot;

Refusing to look at him, Wakaba was staring down the street. From what 
Anthy had been able to gather, the two had undergone a spat the night 
before. And from their body language and pointed ignoring of each other, 
things were still tense. Shiori was quietly leaning her head against 
Juri&#39;s shoulder staring off into space as the man kept pacing. Finally 
Juri could stand it no more.

&quot;Stop already, you&#39;re making me dizzy. I&#39;m sure Miki is just held up or 
something.&quot; But truthfully she didn&#39;t feel so certain. Since the time of 
their youth, the blue haired young man had never lost his habit of 
regulating his life to time itself. Always arriving precisely on time, 
measuring out the minutes, flicking a glance now and then to a 
timepiece. It was as if he always needed to be reassured that time still 
moved for him, that the world never stopped rotating. Although now with 
their memories returned to them, perhaps his weird fetish made a little 
more sense. Time never moved within that hellish school. It had always 
been a paradox of uncertainty...

But it had been an hour since Touga had went inside to confirm a certain 
deal with his mysterious customer, and Miki was late. Was it a cause for 
concern? Could something have happened? Juri tightened her fingers 
around Shiori&#39;s shoulder, gaining strength and calm reassurance just 
from having her nearby. Saionji in the mean time scowled, looking a 
great deal like his younger self.

&quot;Hmph...it&#39;s been an hour already. What is Touga doing in there? And 
just how does he intend to get us inside...&quot;

&quot;Why not ask me yourself, Kyouichi-san?&quot;

Brushing his long red mane back casually over one shoulder, the 
ex-student council President exited the club behind them. He looked 
serious, as if he had just left a nasty bout of negotiation, but when 
his eyes alighted upon them, the look was gone like a distant dream. His 
face was now its usual seductive calm. Saionji huffed and crossed his 
arms.

&quot;So? How did it go? Is your friend going to be able to get us in there? 
The concert will be starting soon...&quot; His violet eyes lowered as he 
spoke. There was a heavy tension in the air. Touga clapped his shoulder 
warmly and gave him a confident smile.

&quot;It...was difficult. But I was able to get us passage into the back 
stage area of the concert stadium. However my...client wishes to let us 
know that dealing with security and any obstacle after that will have to 
be dealt with on our own. Apparently there&#39;s another band playing, and 
their security can be overzealous.&quot;

Juri cocked her head to the side. &quot;Another band?&quot;

Touga nodded. &quot;Yes...the Steel Razors. A metal band from America, and 
quite popular here in Japan. They will be playing with Crysanthium 
Ecstasy as a collaboration for their Black Cord tour.&quot; Saionji rolled 
his eyes. The things kids listened to these days...

Touga looked about the group, casting for something. &quot;Say...where is 
Miki? He&#39;s not here yet?&quot; Juri and Shiori shook their heads while Wakaba 
bit her lip and edged closer to the rest of the group. Touga frowned 
seriously. &quot;That&#39;s odd...and he knows that we are to head to the concert 
hall today. Could he have gone on ahead?&quot;

Juri hesitated before speaking, &quot;No...Miki was never one to act rashly.&quot;

Touga gave a nod, tossing his hair over his shoulders. &quot;That&#39;s what I 
think as well. This does not bode well...could Ten be moving against us 
individually? If so, none of us are safe alone...he and his sister could 
have been kidnapped or worse. We&#39;ve all seen what that thing is capable 
of.&quot;

His voice sent a shot of ice water through their collective veins. Juri 
was immediately pushing off of the car to head there straight away, 
Shiori tugging on her arm. &quot;W-wait! You&#39;re not just going to head over 
there, are you? What about-&quot;

Juri flashed the other woman an icy glare, &quot;Of course I am! I&#39;m not 
going to stand by while Kaoru and his sister could be-&quot;

&quot;Juri she&#39;s right.&quot;

Juri whirled onto Saionji. &quot;Now see here, you stubborn idiot-&quot;

&quot;Juri.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Touga stared into her aquamarine eyes quietly. &quot;This could be part of a 
ploy to deter us...even separate us. A trap...I want to go to Miki as 
well. So I will head over there while you all go on ahead.&quot;

The group all began to argue vehemently. But Touga raised his hand. &quot;I 
will meet you there. It will not take me long to get the house. And in 
the mean time you can be scoping out the situation and planning our 
attack.&quot; He smiled at them, a hand in one of his jacket pockets. Anthy 
walked over to him.

&quot;I do not like you going alone. Not when you will be in danger.&quot;

Touga smiled down at her tenderly. &quot;Ah, but are you not needed there? It 
is you who must face off against Ten. It is you who are in the most 
danger...&quot; She sighed, her lashes fluttering shut. In that moment, she 
looked to him to be ages old. Tired and weary from a millennia of 
traveling. &quot;Yes...you are right. But I still do not like it.&quot;

&quot;I will go with him!&quot; Saionji strode forward, his arms still crossed. 
Touga gave him a small smile and a shake of his head. &quot;No old friend, 
you will be needed there also. I will go alone. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be 
okay.&quot; He stopped suddenly as a small finger jabbed into his chest. He 
looked down to see Wakaba with her hands on her hips, doing her best to 
stare him down.

&quot;Listen you! There&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna go alone! I&#39;m gonna go with 
you, and that&#39;s final!&quot; She crossed her arms, mirroring Saionji&#39;s scowl 
nearly perfectly. Touga blinked in surprise.

&quot;Ah, well, but I don&#39;t think-&quot;

&quot;Not &#39;but&#39;s Mister! With your snazzy suit and prissy looks, you&#39;ll 
probably break a nail or something. Geez, don&#39;t you know it takes a 
woman to get things done? You boys are practically helpless!&quot; She gave a 
grin and a small wave to the others, careful not to look at a green 
haired individual. &quot;Now come on, I wanna get a ride in that nice limo!&quot; 
She looped an arm around his and began to bodily drag him down the 
sidewalk. Touga looked back helplessly to her fianc&eacute;e who shrugged with 
a small sad smile. The brown haired girl glanced back at Saionji only 
once before looking away.

There were small sounds of protest as the pair disappeared around the 
corner. Juri was chuckling despite herself. Anthy smiled warmly in 
amusement. Then her features schooled themselves to the business at 
hand.

&quot;Let&#39;s go everyone. There&#39;s not much time.&quot;

The crowds were already in a frenzy, cheering and screaming out in 
adoration as they waited for the concert&#39;s start. It was a sea of waving 
arms and signs, some depicting one band or another. Many had donned 
black shirts, spraying their hair into risqu&eacute; hairstyles, smearing on 
vibrant make-up. Their voices were like a roar, and Ten listened to it 
with a dreamy smile. Soon...so many bodies...so many seedlings about to 
sprout forth. Truly glorious! Its restless thoughts were interrupted as 
a trio of musicians headed up the corridor. The pink haired singer 
backed away from the edge of the massive black curtains, to greet the 
newcomers. It was a navy blue haired woman, accompanied by two taller 
men.

&quot;I&#39;m telling you that bracelet looks ridiculous, and I refuse to go on 
stage with you while you&#39;re wearing it.&quot;

&quot;Awwww, but Kiri! Come oooooon! The girls will love it!&quot; The blond 
haired man flaunted a large bracelet that looked like a pink fuzzy 
doughnut. Very at odds with the blue and silver vinyl he wore. The woman 
rolled her eyes in disgust as they reached Ten. She bowed.

&quot;Sorry we didn&#39;t get a chance to meet before. I look forward to working 
with you.&quot; Ten&#39;s lips curled into a smile as she bowed in return. 
&quot;Yes...it shall be quite rewarding to work with such a popular band as 
yours.&quot;

The girl shrugged as her black haired band mate leaned down across her 
shoulder. &quot;Oooo! You&#39;re cute! And you&#39;ve got a great throat...vocally I 
mean.&quot; He winked. Kiri shrugged him off and snatched up his arm.

&quot;Well we have curtain call in five minutes. We&#39;ll leave you to your 
preparations. Come on you dummies.&quot; She dragged the two away along the 
closed curtain. They disappeared down a set of stairs that led to the 
mechanical stage elevator. Alone once more, Ten sent out its thoughts to 
its siblings. Silently, the figures of the reborn swords appeared 
alongside her. Their eyes were as cold and blank as steel. Ten smiled. 
&quot;Well my fellows...are all the preparations complete then?&quot;

The being that had once been known as Jared gave a humorless grin. 
&quot;Yessss...&quot; he rasped. It was a sound of rust scraping along stone. &quot; 
The girrrl isss nearrrrly rrrready. Shall I fetch herrrr?&quot; Ten nodded, 
and he left. Sword Eric sat down alongside Sword Mason&#39;s shoes. Mason 
was swaying upon his feet to music only he could hear. Quickly the Sword 
in Jared returned, dragging Violet by the arm. She was dressed in an 
elaborate gothic gown, similar in design to the one the Rose Bride used 
to wear. There were tear streaks running through her black eye make-up.

&quot;W-why are you doing this?! Please stop! I-I don&#39;t want to do this 
anymore, let m-me go Ten!&quot; The girl sobbed as she tugged futilely at her 
arm. Ten smiled, &quot;Ohhh, my poor girl...surely you must....hate me now, 
no?&quot; The girl sobbed harder in response. Ten frowned slightly. She moved 
forward towards the smaller girl, every step a boneless glide. It was 
like she was moving on water, instead of six-inch boots. She ran her 
pale hand through the space over Violet&#39;s head. She frowned a little 
more.

&quot;Hmmm...still stubbornly in love, eh? That&#39;s something of a problem, you 
see. I need you to hate me.&quot; Violet&#39;s chin was roughly jerked up so that 
she met those silver eyes. Utena&#39;s angelic expression morphed into a 
cruel parody, as she leaned in closer to her face. Violet could feel hot 
breath on her lips. Jerking her head out of that hand, she twisted away 
from her and the man&#39;s arms that still held her. The barest hint of lips 
tickled her ear.

&quot;And you will hate me, Violet...oh yes...I will make you hate me...&quot; 
Violet cried out in agony as teeth savagely bit into her ear. Ten reared 
back, chin dripping with blood. Violet screamed as she held her ear 
cupped in her hand. Jared shoved her to the floor, looking at her with 
disgust. There was a near perfect half moon of teeth marks. Eric rose to 
her feet and hurried over to Ten.

Ten stood backlit by the lights of the scaffolding around them, with her 
fellow sword licking her chin in smooth languorous strokes. Her 
expression never changed, even when Eric finished and wound her arms 
about the slim body of her leader. An overhead sign began blink 
urgently, alerting them it was time to go on stage.

&quot;Let&#39;s go. I have children to bear...&quot;

Anthy gave a start as an explosion of noise greeted them when they 
stepped into the main lobby of the stadium. A security guard had greeted 
them as they had approached the back entrance, and had led them through 
a maze of corridors. He had quickly left them though, pointing them in 
the direction of the backstage area. Music was roaring down the hall, 
reverberating off the walls. It was a physical sensation, it was so 
loud. Her eyes narrowed in fear.

&quot;We need to hurry! They&#39;ve already started!&quot; The company needed no 
further encouragement. In a rush of sprinting heels and moving limbs, 
the men and women of Ohtori&#39;s graduates navigated the narrow doorways 
and stretching marble floors of the concert hall. The stopped up short 
as a pair of muscled men headed their way.

&quot;You there! Who are you?!&quot;

Saionji took the lead and smashed a fist into the nearest man&#39;s face. He 
clotheslined the other man with a solid whack of his forearm. Hustling 
along once more, they slowed as a voice took over the microphone.

&quot;For all of our wonderful fans out there...this song is for you!&quot; A 
thunderous bout of whistles and screams abated only when guitar cords 
sang along the air. Anthy reached the edge of the curtained stage first. 
What she saw made her hesitate.

Utena was cradling a mic stand to her body like a lover. Her costume&#39;s 
fur cape draped about her body like a conforming glove. With her spiked 
pink hair and her gleaming piercings, Utena was a magnet for the eye. 
Dangerous...sleek...desirable. But her silver eyes slid over to the 
right, snatching up Anthy&#39;s own. The creature&#39;s seductive grin widened. 
She now had her true audience at last. Rearing back her head, baring the 
long line of her throat, her lips parted. An unearthly croon crawled 
from the expanse of flesh and muscle.

&quot;As I&#39;m swinging here within the sheltered gloom

I hear your voice

It&#39;s the sound of the creaking seat-&quot; Her head lowered as her words 
became harshly whispered to her captive devotees.

&quot;Of the frost on the chains

Of the fog on my lips
Childrens&#39; echoes laughing at the back of my heels...&quot;

Her eyes were closed, body rocking in time to Jared&#39;s guitar. It was 
silent except for the two of them. The crowd was spellbound. Juri 
reached Anthy&#39;s side, her face taking on a cold scowl. &quot;How are we going 
to...&quot;

Ten seemed to sense the presence of the rest of them gathering, as she 
slowly stalked backwards to come by Violet&#39;s side. The girl was hunched 
over her keyboard, shivering from her nearness. Utena&#39;s eyes flicked 
over to them again as she smirked as she placed a proprietary hand on 
the younger girl&#39;s shoulder. Juri let out a low growl. She was taunting 
them! Using Violet as a hostage! It was unforgivable...she may just have 
to kick Tenjou&#39;s ass on principle.

Anthy placed a hand on her arm to calm her, as Shiori slipped her hand 
into the fencer&#39;s own. The orange curled woman relaxed slightly, leaning 
into her partner&#39;s side.

On stage, Ten was still working the crowd of teenagers and adults below, 
stalking along the stage with the microphone in her gloved hand.

&quot;The shriek of the steel...&quot; her voice had lowered octaves until it had 
become a guttural growl. &quot;...Matches the shriek of my soul...&quot; Bodies 
below her began gyrating and moving as one. Feet stomping, heads thrown 
back, it was a sea of energy!

&quot;The grit of the sand...&quot; The crowd held its breath. &quot;..is the grit in 
my heart!&quot; hissing the last word, a platform lifted from the stage 
revealing the Steel Razors in all of their glory. The girl and the 
blonde were like demons on their guitars, and both band&#39;s drummers 
exploded in a frenzy of beats. The crowd had lost it. Anthy felt the 
hair on her neck stand on end at the electric primal emotion being 
pounded out by the group of young adults. It took her breath away, and 
for a haunting moment she too felt like tossing her head back and 
joining in. The feeling was so strong she had to grip the wall. Why not? 
A voice whispered. Why not lift up your arms in praise, worshiping the 
gods of death and renewal? This was a celebration that was as old as the 
first men in their caves. Pounding on the rock walls with bare fists, to 
sing of the black joy in their inner hearts! This was godly and mighty, 
and the whole world needed to join in as one!

Anthy shook her head and focused her inner sight. Yes...there...she 
could see it in her mind&#39;s eye. There was a storm of silver blades 
boiling with the singer&#39;s voice. Each word she spoke sent another small 
dagger singing through the air to prick the unprotected hearts of her 
followers. Anthy&#39;s eyes flew open. She jerked on Juri&#39;s arm hard. The 
panther had been swaying to the music, her eyes going distant.

&quot;Juri! Saionji! Do not listen to this! That thing speaks lies! Her music 
is the key!&quot; Saionji blinked slowly, trying to bring his attention back 
to her. Why were her lips moving so slowly? All he could hear was that 
lovely black angel&#39;s voice...it spoke of the violence in his blood...of 
the joys of swordsmanship...of the dying warriors of old, noble in their 
bloody quests...this was right...this was holy!...this was-

A ringing slap brought him instantly back to himself. Anthy was rubbing 
the back of her hand. Saionji glowered at her for a minute, and then 
realized he had been stroking his unsheathed sword possesively. Shaking 
his head to clear it, he frowned.

&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes flashed dangerously. &quot;We have to stop her! Now! She can&#39;t 
be allowed to sing!&quot;

Saionji looked back to the stage, gripping his katana tighter. He 
scratched his goatee in thought. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we wait...for Touga? And 
doesn&#39;t she have the girl--?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time! She&#39;s nearly completed the ritual! She&#39;s using the 
adoration of the crowd to fuel the spell! She nearly has all ten swords 
in homes!&quot; Juri squeezed Shiori&#39;s hand and pushed her back slightly. 
&quot;Wait here for us! Come on Kyouichi!&quot; The green haired man nodded and 
the two of them ran out on stage.

The crowd cheered as they appeared with their drawn weapons, Juri with 
her foil and Saionji with his katana. Anthy appeared with a deck of 
cards and a rose in her hand. She began chanting under her breath as 
Saionji lifted his sword against the nearest black haired band member...

And was thrown back by a blue haired figure crashing into him. Saionji 
stared up stupidly as Miki Kaoru, clad in a black dueling uniform, stood 
over him sneering in disgust. Juri stopped short. Ten was paying them no 
attention, focusing on her wailing song.

&quot;M-miki! W-what are you...?&quot; Saionji coughed, trying to get the wind 
back in his lungs. His words strangled away when a needle sharp tip of a 
foil poked under his chin.

&quot;You are not allowed to interfere, Duelist. Leave now before your blood 
paints the stage.&quot;

His voice was absolutely calm and certain of itself, with more than a 
hint of arrogance. Very unlike the young Kaoru. Juri hesitated only a 
second before whiping her blade around towards him. The Sword inside 
neatly parried the move, and jabbed viciously at her torso. Her blouse 
split in a tiny cut over her heart. Saionji leaped up to swing a fist, 
but was yanked by the hair backward. More of the band had given up their 
instruments to join in the fray.

The crowd roared in approval.

*******

&quot;My god...what have they done to you...&quot; Touga knelt before the body of 
Kozue and had to twist his face away. Wakaba was still standing in 
horror of the doorway. It was awful...those ropes and all that blood... 
Touga hesitated only a moment before drawing his sword and carefully 
snapping the cruel bindings. Kozue&#39;s body slumped to the floor 
bonelessly. Tucking his long red hair into his suit collar, to keep it 
out of the way, Touga knelt with a frown. She seemed to have been dead 
for hours...

&quot;Get out of the way!&quot;

Touga was pushed back by Wakaba, who had seemed to have overcome her 
revulsion and shock. She moved swiftly and skillfully, checking the 
body&#39;s vital signs. She looked up, all trace of the normal playfulness 
gone. Her face was deadly serious. He mused that this must be Nurse 
Wakaba showing her face.

&quot;She has a pulse, and she&#39;s breathing on her own. I need hot water, 
clean towels, and the first aide kit. Check the fridge for any sports 
drinks. She&#39;s dehydrated. We need to get her off of the floor.&quot; Touga 
blinked dumbly for a moment, but a swat from her hand had him on his 
feet and moving quickly. He scooped the girl&#39;s body carefully in his 
arms and deposited her gently on the clean side of the bed. Wakaba went 
to work as he fetched the things she needed.

Within moments, they has her cleaned up reasonably well, and had looked 
to her wounds. There were several ugly cuts from straining against the 
ropes for hours. Kozue seemed paler and more delicate than Kiryuu could 
ever remember seeing her. Like a broken china doll. Her body was a mess 
of bruises. What in god&#39;s name had Ten done to her? He feared finding 
out, but had an awful idea...

Wakaba set to cleaning out any infections, and stitching a couple of 
deeper gashes where she found them. Touga was hustled out of the room as 
she worked. He put his hands in his pockets, bemused. Where was Miki 
though...was he somewhere else in the house? Perhaps he&#39;d best 
investigate. He hated surprises.

Unfortunately as he rounded the corner to the kitchen, that&#39;s exactly 
what he got.

Waiting for him, perched up on the dining room table. With her knees up 
provocatively, a blond haired woman smiled at him. Touga&#39;s blood ran 
cold as he stared into those dead eyes.

&quot;...Nanami...&quot;

Nanami Kiryuu smiled at him, wearing the tattered remains of her 
designer suit. There was a cut on her cheek and a sword in her hand. 
&quot;Hello Touga-chan...&quot;

The voice that came from that purring throat was not her own. Touga 
raised his sword in front of him, backing out the doorway as she slipped 
down to the floor...

Anthy raised her arms in the air, summoning a ring of green swirling 
light about her body. The band members of Steel Razors were still 
doggedly trying to keep on playing atop their raised dais, but all of 
them were wide eyed with confusion and fear as a mass fight broke out on 
the stage below them. Ten was still singing, but now there was a 
shimmering in the air around her. Jak looked to Kiri, shaking his blond 
hair out of his face.

&quot;W-what the hell is going on down there?!&quot; He whispered urgently. Kiri 
looked a bit pale as she bit her lower lip and kept on viciously picking 
her guitar. &quot;Don&#39;t know. But we better keep playing.&quot;

Ten crooned throatily into her mic, during the guitar interlude, then 
paused to block the air in front of her face as streams of energy plowed 
at her. Glaring at the witch, she made a throwing motion, and Anthy 
cried out in pain. Blood erupted from a wound to her shoulder, but she 
kept on making signs with her hands. She had to cast the right spell!

Juri had just delivered a fluid kick to the face of a mohawked man, 
sending him down hard, but now was pinned in the arms of a barrel-armed 
skinhead. She growled in anger, and tried to break free. He squeezed his 
arms, and the fencer gave a loud wheeze. The bastard was strong! She 
needed to...needed to...

A cry right next to her ear, and the arms fell away. Shiori stood there, 
holding her saber. It was now stained red. Juri took the shaking girl in 
her arms, holding her tightly. But they quickly separated and stood at 
each other&#39;s backs. Shiori handed Juri back her sword, making the 
panther smile. &quot;Hmmm...remind me to bring yours next time, love.&quot; Shiori 
grinned back at her bravely.

Saionji was battling a monkey-like girl who had leapt onto his back. She 
had her thighs squeezing around his neck, and a dagger in his ear. Try 
as he might, he couldn&#39;t bring his katana around to get at her. An evil 
whisper made him stiffen.

&quot;Mmmm...scream for me baby...&quot;

And then he did. A shrieking pain in his ear made him thrash enough to 
knock her off. He was still shrieking, but the world had gone silent on 
one side of him. He pressed his palm into the side of his head, trying 
to stop the redness pouring from out of his ear canal.

The crowd cheered in macabre joy.

Ten kicked the fallen swordsman out of her way and motioned to Miki. He 
stopped his attack on Juri and quickly trotted over to his mistress. His 
smile was dreamy with pride.

&quot;Command me, Three. What do you require?&quot;

Ten, now only Three, stood from a crouch and wailed religiously into her 
microphone making the hair on everyone&#39;s arms stand up with goosebumps. 
Her ghostly voice faded and she put the mic down to speak to him. &quot;I 
need your help in preparing another one of our siblings.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; He replied, looking over to the Steel Razors. &quot;It shall be 
done.&quot;

He monkey-climbed up the scaffolding, his pale hands slapping up near 
Alex&#39;s boot. He heaved himself over gracefully and gave the three of 
them a disgusted look. His voice affected one of authority.

&quot;Ten says you&#39;re missing chords. You&#39;re blowing this performance.&quot; Jak 
tossed his blond hair angrily. &quot;What was that?! The hell you say! Ya&#39;ll 
are the ones down there goin&#39; off the deep end!!&quot;

Miki shook his head and leaned out of the way as Jak pounding with more 
energy on his bass. Miki peered at them silently a moment, half hidden 
in the shadow of the side of the dais.

&quot;There...you did it again. What&#39;s happening down below was decided by 
the producers as a publicity stunt. Pelican Records didn&#39;t think your 
band could handle it. So Crysanthium Ecstasy was chosen.&quot;

Jak growled looking at him. &quot;Your band asked US to come and play with 
you! You guys are just a bunch of one-hit wonders! Who do you guys think 
you ARE?!&quot;

&quot;Jak! Enough! Calm down! Now you really ARE missing notes!&quot;

&quot;Naw Kiri, this is bullshit! What the hell man?! This is the thanks we 
get?!&quot;

&quot;Jak....please...&quot;

Steel Razors concentrated on playing for a few more minutes. The concert 
was out of control. They were feeling swept up in events that were 
beyond them. What was going on with Pelican Records lately, not 
informing them of stage performances? Kiri decided she&#39;d have a stern 
talk with the guy in charge when this was all over. Jak was calming 
down...and then Miki spoke one last time.

&quot;...Ten says to try a bit less pelvic thrusting on the next interlude. 
It&#39;d be better to go with a forward dip...&quot;

Jak exploded. &quot;Ten can shove her orders up her ass!! I don&#39;t even KNOW 
that bitch, but NOBODY tells Jak-Boy how to perform in his concerts!!&quot;

Kiri was desperate now, &quot;Jak! Not the time! Calm down!!&quot;

&quot;He turned to her, with eyes aflame, &quot;Fuck no! Now you too?! Stop 
bossing me around Kiri, I ain&#39;t yer damn son!!&quot; He gave a roar, and then 
a strangled gasp. Wordlessly his bass dropped from his fingers. Before 
Kiri could react, another hand slapped up on the scaffolding, and Ten&#39;s 
shock of pink spikes came into view. Those perfect cupid bow lips were 
in a smooth coy smile.

&quot;Hello Jak-boy...gives us a kiss...&quot;

She yanked on Jak&#39;s tie, bringing him down in a deep bow. In a creak of 
vinyl, he was yanked hard to meet Ten&#39;s face, as her hand snaked around 
his neck. She kissed him then, deeply. For a second, Kiri was simply 
slack jawed. Then her eyes narrowed at the knot of terror that was 
tangling in her gut. Something was...

Jak convulsed against those soft lips, and he reared back for air. His 
lips parted as he looked up blindly. A rattling breath wheezed into his 
lungs. And then...he began to laugh.

High and grating, the Sword within Jak rang out in youthful pleasure as 
he stretched his arms wide. This body was now his! Finally!

Ten motioned for him to pick up his bass. &quot;One last concerto before our 
rebirth, my brother. Let us play for these foolish mortals the sounds of 
the World&#39;s End.

Jak grinned toothily and picked up his bass. He turned to Kiri with that 
smirk, his eyes glinting bright quicksilver. She flinched in shock. His 
voice came low and threatening. &quot;You heard her...play on mortal...&quot;

Touga ducked another lunge, snapping his wrists to meet the charge. Damn 
it...his sister had never been this skilled. These Swords were an 
entirely new caliber...his foot...

He ducked in a clumsy dodge, and nearly slipped in his boot. There were 
bloody footprints tracked all over the Kaoru&#39;s carpeted hallways, from 
the stab wound he&#39;d suffered straight through his right foot. His jacket 
was severely sliced in places, and his shoulder was aching. This was 
bad...he couldn&#39;t let her get through to Wakaba and Kozue!

&quot;WAKABA!!&quot; He yelled, trying to parry another precise strike from the 
thing in his Nanami&#39;s body. Their swords met in a flash of sparks. 
&quot;WAKABA!! YOU MUST GET OUT OF HERE!! GET KOZUE AND RUN!!&quot; His 
high-pitched voice rang down the walls, greeted only by silence. Had 
they heard him? Had they escaped out the back?

His moment of distraction cost him. With a grunt, a pointy high-heeled 
toed caught him below the sternum. He crashed into the wall behind him 
as if he&#39;d been kicked by an elephant. What power! How on earth were 
they supposed to beat these things? This was madness...

He lifted his sword again as the blond chuckled and stalked toward him 
slowly. There was a loud resounding &#39;CLANG&#39;. Then her eyes rolled up 
into the back of her head as she dropped bonelessly to the floor. Kozue 
stood trembling where Nanami had once stood, holding a badly dented 
metal vase.

&quot;Huh...well...I always hated this thing anyway.&quot; She tried to smirk, but 
had to stop because of the swelling of her lip. Touga hitched his 
breath, and then slowly slid down the wall.

Safe...they were safe... For now anyway.

Touga gave Kozue a warm smile. &quot;Well my dear, it&#39;s good to see you back 
among the land of the living.&quot;

She did grin this time, though it clearly pained her. &quot;Hey, I saved your 
pretty hide, didn&#39;t I? Still feel pretty dead though...&quot; She winced as 
she touched a line of stitches up her arm. Her eyes flared in anger. 
&quot;That damn bitch did this to me...I can&#39;t believe I was duped. Touga, 
what the hell is going on?&quot; Her blue eyes locked firmly onto his, 
smoldering in rage. Touga picked himself off of the floor and came to 
take her by the shoulders. He draped his tattered jacket about her slim 
body, and carefully embraced her.

&quot;I am glad you are safe...your brother will be delighted I think. And 
yes I will tell you everything, but we need to get into the car. We are 
meeting the others.&quot;

She looked up at him in confusion and suspicion. &quot;Others? What others, 
Kiryuu?&quot;

He smiled down at her, looking very tired. &quot;Everyone...from the days of 
Ohtori.&quot;

Her eyes widened a bit then narrowed as she gave a quick nod. &quot;Let&#39;s go 
then. I want to hear everything.&quot; Always direct his Kozue, Touga thought 
with a mental sigh. They located Wakaba wielding a golf club. There was 
a brief discussion before they decided to tie Nanami up using several 
pairs of Kozue&#39;s own handcuffs, and the garden hose. They couldn&#39;t find 
any metal chains. Within minutes the three were as comfortable as they 
could manage in the back of Touga&#39;s limo, speeding towards the concert 
hall.

&quot;You don&#39;t give up, do you witch?!&quot; Hissed Eric, as a flare of green 
light sliced the back of her hand. &quot;We are going to make all of you pay 
for eternity! Your screams will echo forever!!&quot;

Anthy glowered at the girl, before using a large slap of power to send 
her careening away. Once again she tried to get a lock on Utena, but it 
was as if there was a veil about her. With every release of a sword, 
their power grew. She was in trouble...she needed to stop her voice!

The ocean of bodies swayed in time with the still pounding music of the 
stage, singing along as Ten led them in a chorus. Anthy hiked up her 
skirts, and clopped across the stage. She needed to be closer...there! 
She had her in sight. The dark skinned sorceress moved her hands like 
winding serpents working her power into thick ropes.

Ten looked up and snarled as a metaphysical collar constricted around 
it&#39;s throat. Ten, now actually just Two, roared in anger. Her dulcet 
voice cut across the stage like knives, bleeding those standing nearby. 
Shiori winced from where she was cradling Saionji&#39;s shivering body to 
hers. A line of blood ran down her cheek.

&quot;You think to shackle me!? You are too late!&quot; Two reached behind her and 
flung Violet&#39;s keyboard out of the way. It cracked in half on the cement 
lip of the stage. Violet cried out in terror as Two yanked her by her 
chin. Her long pale fingers bruising the sides of her cheeks.

&quot;Well girl, gaze about you! I do this all for you.&quot; Violet sobbed and 
was thrown to the floor. &quot;Now then...perhaps an offering? Something to 
make you feel like a Queen! Hmmm...how about someone you admire?&quot; Miki 
stepped forward and got down on both knees before the lead Sword. He 
smiled back at Violet and then closed his eyes.

&quot;Hmmm...he is a pretty thing, isn&#39;t he Violet?&quot; Two cooed in pleasure. 
She held her hand out at her side. The air shimmered and seemed to 
condense. Suddenly a shining saber of tempered glass was resting in her 
palm neatly. She brought the blade slowly up, watching the gothic girl&#39;s 
eyes follow it. &quot;Let&#39;s make him prettier, shall we?&quot;

She lunged down in a vicious arc, driving the blade in home. Miki 
gasped, his body contorting backward painfully. The tip of the sword 
speared out from behind him, to drip scarlet on his pants leg. Violet 
shrieked, her eyes spilling over with hot tears. &quot;NOOOO!! HOW COULD 
YOU?! I HATE YOU I HATE YOU!! WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO HIM?!&quot;

Two grinned in triumph, pulling the sword back out. Miki smiled as the 
wound re-closed. In two full bounds, the Sword was standing over the 
fallen girl, and pulling her into her own arms. &quot;Perfect, my dear! And 
now, sealed with a kiss!&quot; Two pressed her lips hotly on the wet salty 
lips of the surprised girl, delivering her seed. Violet jerked in her 
arms, but she held onto the girl tightly. When she felt that coil of 
power expand and fill it&#39;s new host, she released the girl to take a 
step back. Everything stopped. Juri and Shiori paused in horror. Anthy 
was shrieking something intelligible, but her spell was slapped away 
like a child&#39;s plaything. Violet wore a cold smile.

&quot;It is done...&quot;

Ten, now only One, crowed in triumph. &quot;Then come my siblings!! From all 
corners of the earth, rise up and be reborn! Lend me your strength 
siblings! It is time we take this world!&quot;

The crowd was boiling over...the time was finally ripe...

FLASH!

Jak leaned back and threw his arms wide to release his power.

FLASH!

In a dusty office, surrounded by the cooling bodies of executives, 
Jared&#39;s father threw his hands up in offering.

FLASH! FLASH!

Eric and Mason shared a calm look as they each raised a hand.

FLASH!

Miki wiped off the cooling blood from his healed chest and grinned at 
the One.

FLASH! FLASH!

Jared and Utena shared a teasing kiss in front of their adoring fans, as 
their power mingled and expelled through their parting lips.

FLASH!

In a silent campus, in disrepair and without its students, a hunched 
figure below a large projector looked up as he felt his siblings call 
upon him. Akio Ohtori, once the most powerful man in the world, now a 
faded shadow in memory, raised a hand and expelled what was left of his 
being as the Sword in him bid him do.

Fl-

But a problem has occurred. Something is not right. No...the One muses 
in alarm. Something has happened to one of her brethren. Where is the 
Sword of Hatred Born of Love?! Why does she not answer the Call?!

But Sword Nanami cannot answer, nor can she add her final component. For 
she is not only bound physically, but a worse thing has happened. Touga, 
before leaving, jokingly had thrown a red rose down upon her unconscious 
chest. There it still lay. And the Sword could not cross the thorns. 
Touga had not known, but he had effectively sealed her in a way that 
simple metal bands could never do. For there is power in symbolism...

And the spell is damaged.

It is twisting.

It is flaring like an angry dragon that cannot spread its wings. But 
still it tries. It pours into the audience, cracking open the seeds of 
hate in their hearts. But it is not enough! Nearly a thousand new swords 
are born, but it is not enough! Not enough! It cannot fly out past the 
spells and web of mysticism that the Witch has carefully splayed all 
around the stadium. It doesn&#39;t have enough power, and the spell weakens.

A moment of triumph is turned to a moment of unbridled anger. The One 
shrieks her hatred and lunges at where the duelists lay. But they are 
gone. The Witch is leading them out the exit in retreat. Anger! Rage! 
Disbelief! The spell, so carefully cultivated and nurtured splinters 
apart and is gone. It cannot be re-raised. It could only have happened 
once.

And the Million Swords do not resurrect. They are numbered now...they 
are only a Thousand, and the One roars her undying oaths.

The sea of pulsating humans is now still. Not a hair twitches or moves. 
They are statues, unreal and alien with their silver eyes and 
unbreathing lungs. Their eyes are on the One.

&quot;Do not let them escape! Find them and rip them apart!!&quot;

The sea moves as one, pouring out of the pit, spilling into the walkways 
and exits. They must slice and carve! They must find the Knights and 
their Witch! They must kill!

But the Witch has been given a small miracle.

&quot;Anthy, w-what? Damn it, get in quickly!!&quot; Touga orders as the shambling 
group nearly falls dead at his feet. He props open the limo door and 
helps take Saionji by the arms. Wakaba gives a small scream and pulls 
him the rest of the way into the limo. Anthy and Juri climb in next, as 
Shiori shuts the door behind them. Touga slaps the window, and the 
driver squeals tires as they peel away. The mob of Swords chases after 
them on the horizon. But gradually they fade away as the limo roars away 
into the night.

Touga is holding Anthy to his body, trying to warm her skin. My god...it 
feels as if her skin is made of ice! Anthy sits, staring unblinkingly 
before her in shock. Juri is holding Shiori, who is sobbing into her 
shoulder quietly. The window rolls down as the driver looks back at the 
occupants.

&quot;Hey Touga...where the hell am I going? I need some kind of directions 
here.&quot; Kozue smiles back at them, her faces still a mess of bruises. 
Anthy jerked back into reality, out of her string of black thoughts.

&quot;Kozue...my god...did she do this to you?&quot;

Kozue&#39;s face darkened in answer. Anthy put her face in her hands. &quot;I&#39;m 
so sorry Kaoru-san...Here...let me heal you...&quot; Kozue cocked an eyebrow 
as her trademark seductive smirk etched across her features. &quot;Why 
certainly...&quot; She drawled, &quot;I always did like it in a limo.&quot; Anthy 
blinked a moment, and then chuckled quietly. She shook her head as she 
placed hands over Saionji&#39;s bleeding head.

The poor man was mumbling incoherently, his brow slick in sweat. His 
rolling eyes saw nothing, but the clouded haze broke away as Anthy 
poured her strength and love down into the palms of her hands. She 
cupped his ear, and he sighed in relief. A warm buzzing sensation eased 
his fatigue, re-knitting tissue, resting deep into his muscles. He fell 
into a quiet slumber, in the arms of his beloved, who still cried into 
his hair. Anthy leaned back into her seat, to catch her breath.

She had expended a great deal of energy at the concert hall...it felt 
like she used up every ounce of power in her bones. And yet there were 
still so many to heal...to help...to ease...was this what Dios had once 
felt like? The weight of those needing him crashing onto his shoulders 
painfully? Being aware of their suffering, even through the blanket of 
weariness that threatened to engulf the senses. Anthy&#39;s head tipped low, 
and she blinked rapidly. She blinked again and gave her head a shake.

She was so tired...but she couldn&#39;t sleep yet...so much to plan, and now 
the Swords were loose, and they were being hunted...

She looked up to see Touga hugging her warmly. Juri and Shiori had each 
placed a hand on her knee to steady her, smiling tiredly. Anthy smiled 
back in mild wonder. Their love...it was too much for someone like her. 
She didn&#39;t deserve it. But she still treasured their friendship deep in 
her heart.

&quot;Anthy, you need to rest. We&#39;ll be alright for a few hours, and you look 
nearly dead.&quot; The orange curled woman remarked reasonably from her seat. 
Kozue was still intently looking at the road ahead, navigating the 
traffic lights.

&quot;Yes...I suppose so...forgive me...&quot;

Juri smiled at her softly. Her words were quiet, &quot;We already have.&quot; The 
double meaning helped to lift some of the weight Anthy felt. Green eyes 
closed, as her head leaned back on the seat. Kozue looked back once 
more, taking in the scene with interest. It had been so long since all 
of them where gathered back together...but...where was her brother? 
There was still a great deal they hadn&#39;t yet learned, such as what 
exactly had happened at the Crysanthium concert. But seeing the 
weariness in that dusky face stilled her impatience. She would ask the 
others perhaps...after they had all rested a bit.

Anthy&#39;s soft melodic voice startled her a bit, as it came from behind 
those closed eyes.

&quot;East...drive east...we are heading to place of power. And perhaps, we 
will be able to gain some assistance for our upcoming battle with the 
Swords of Hatred.&quot;

Kozue blinked. East? That was a bit vague... &quot;Just where East exactly? 
What place of power are you talking about exactly?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes opened and captured hers in the dark. The wild animal, who 
still ruled those about her with seductive words and coy prowling, felt 
her heart flutter involuntarily. Her attention was completely captured 
for a moment, forgetting the road ahead or the wheel in-between her 
hands. Those emerald orbs held hers for a moment before speaking.

&quot;A place you should remember well, Kozue-san....we are going to Nemuro 
Memorial Hall...&quot;
