<h1>A Special Case (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/special-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>My apartment had never looked so good to me. There were several 
messages on the answering machine, but there was no rush to answer 
them. I called Nikki and told her that I was back and to be in the 
office bright and early. She yelled at me for not checking in, but I 
told her that I&#146;d explain the next morning.

I made myself some strong coffee and watched TV until the dinner I 
ordered had arrived. Chinese tonight. Juri and Miiko ate too healthy 
for my taste and I craved fried rice - it tasted better than usual. I 
was feeling satisfied and happy with my place in the world when the 
phone rang. I let the machine pick it up.

&quot;This is Himemiya Anshi. Please call me at your earliest convenience.&quot; 
The noise of a disconnect. Hmmm. I walked over to the machine and hit 
the replay button. The first message was from a friend. Second one was 
from a credit card company offering me a great deal on long distance.

The third was more interesting. There was silence, then a voice 
hissed. &quot;You bastard!&quot; Then a scratchy silence. &quot;Stop looking for 
Tenjou Utena or something much worse than being knocked out will 
happen to you.&quot; The phone was hung up. Well, now, that was 
interesting. Of course, the voice was muffled and unrecognizable. The 
last call was from Nikki, wondering what was up &#150; not panicked, just 
worried.

Not one call from my client. And I was gone three days longer than 
planned. No call until just now. How fascinating. I stared at the 
phone for a long time, debating whether to call her or not. It was 
obvious to me that the only way I was going to get to the bottom of 
this was to find out what secret my client was hiding. I picked up the 
phone.

She picked up on the first ring. &quot;This is Himemiya.&quot;

She recognized my voice and I proceeded to apologize for the 
unexpected delay. She sounded unconcerned and suggested we get 
together yet again to discuss business over a meal.

&quot;My treat this time. Meet me outside the Kyoto National Museum.&quot;

We agreed upon a time and rang off. &quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; was 
what kept going through my mind, over and over.

 

I brought bento boxes I picked up from my favorite street stand and 
met my client in front of the museum. We ate outside in the sun on a 
bench and watched the people streaming into and out of the Museum 
grounds. She was, I noted, not uncomfortable with my choice of 
location &#150; or food. In fact, she was completely at ease, just as she 
had been at Capital Toyotei. A rare woman indeed, and an enigma on 
many levels.

We finished up and wandered into the museum and began to stroll 
through the permanent collection. I gave a concise, somewhat edited 
report on my visits with Saionji and Juri. 

She stopped in front a large piece of calligraphy from the Edo period, 
as I told her of my little brush with discomfort. Her eyes were dark 
with concern. When I had arrived at our assignation, she had noticed 
the now-faded bruises on my cheek and asked about them. I told her 
that we should eat first &#150; that I like to keep business and eating 
separate. She had smiled at that.

Now as I told her of being rescued by Juri, watched all night by Miiko 
and my recovery in their care, she looked genuinely concerned. I was 
touched by it, but unsure what it meant. I finished my report and we 
continued to walk.

&quot;The school records you gave me.&quot; I said conversationally, &quot;They&#146;re 
fake, aren&#146;t they?&quot;

Miss Himemiya said nothing. She stopped in front of a Heian painting &#150; 
a representation of the Buddhist hells. Demons at the various levels 
tortured their victims with their own desires. She stared up at the 
painting, her hands clasped behind her back. She looked young all of a 
sudden. Like a schoolgirl on a field trip. I could see her in that 
photo, embraced by Tenjou, her smile bland but sweet. Her voice 
snapped me out of my reverie.

&quot;Yes, they are. But they are also the &quot;official&quot; records of the 
school. As far as Ohtori Academy knows, Tenjou Utena did all the 
things in those records &#150; one more in an endless succession of 
students.&quot; She sounded distant.

We stood and looked at hell together in silence. As one, we turned 
away and continued into the next gallery.

&quot;Did you change those records?&quot; My voice was softer than I had 
expected it to be.

She looked up at me, her eyes bright with some memory. &quot;Yes. It was 
the last thing I did before&#133;before I left.&quot; That look, the one of 
remembered pain, settled across her face once again. I turned towards 
her, stopping where I stood. I held her by the shoulders and look hard 
into her eyes.

&quot;Anshi &#150; please tell me the truth.&quot; She reacted with surprise to my 
use of her given name, but she didn&#146;t correct me. She turned her head 
away from me and said nothing.

&quot;Please&#133;&quot; I begged.

&quot;I&#133;can&#146;t.&quot; her voice was tortured, broken. I let go of her shoulders 
and she put her hands over her face and began to cry.

I pulled out a handkerchief and she took it, but did not look at me. I 
could feel my heart breaking for her. I was at a loss. I had no more 
leads and my client had lied to me. And all I wanted&#133;all I wanted was 
to take her in my arms and hold her and tell her that it would be 
alright. 

I tentatively reached a hand out for her and when she didn&#146;t flinch at 
my touch, a second hand. Her sobs grew quieter, but did not stop. At 
last I gave in completely and held her tightly to me, stroking her 
hair while she cried. I could feel her tears soaking my shirt and feel 
her body quaking with her grief. 

At last the tears subsided. Anshi pulled herself together, wiped her 
face and with a self-deprecating laugh, suggested we leave. &quot;I believe 
I&#146;ve made a sufficient spectacle of myself for one day.&quot;

As we left, I offered her my arm and when she took it, she gave it a 
slight squeeze in thanks. It made me very happy.

We walked to my office, so she could clean up before she left. I was 
sitting on my desk when she came in. Her face was shiny and a little 
puffy and the sight left me breathless. I stood quickly, but she held 
up a hand to stop me.

&quot;I&#146;ve made up my mind.&quot; She announced. &quot;I can&#146;t tell you everything. 
But there are a few things I can tell you. And so, I will.&quot;

I sat back down on the desk and waited while she gathered herself 
together.

&quot;I hope you aren&#146;t tired of hearing my stories.&quot; She said. I shook my 
head and she gave me a small smile. &quot;Good, because there is another 
one you need to hear. You remember the story I last told you?&quot; I 
nodded. Then she did. &quot;Good.&quot; Deep breath.

&quot;Well, then. The Prince had the sister, you remember &#150; the witch. The 
Prince came up with an idea that he could get his power back, but he 
needed to take it from someone else. So he created a situation in 
which a group of children, who all excelled in many things and were 
strong and capable, would be gathered together. And the finest of them 
would be rewarded with power and prestige. But there was a small price 
to pay &#150; nothing unreasonable. Silly, even. They would have to fight 
duels for the possession of one of the students. Well, one after 
another, students stepped up to take this challenge, but in the end, 
none were truly strong enough. And the Prince at first grew desperate, 
then forgot entirely why he had created this situation in the first 
place. He grew to love the duels for themselves and forgot that he and 
his sister were trapped in their pain-wracked and weakened bodies.

&quot;He. Forgot.&quot; Anshi stared at the floor. She looked like she wanted to 
speak, but some force held her back. Her body was tense with some pain 
I couldn&#146;t identify.

She took another deep breath. &quot;And by the time Tenjou Utena,&quot; her 
voice cracked, &quot;came, neither the Prince nor the Princess believed 
that they would ever be free.&quot; She looked at me, pleading with me to 
understand. 

I cleared my throat. &quot;But Tenjou did believe, didn&#146;t she? And she 
freed the Prince and the Princess?&quot; 

Anshi nodded and swallowed hard. &quot;But the Prince didn&#146;t, couldn&#146;t even 
realize it, so enamored was he with his games.&quot;

&quot;But you did &#150; and you left Ohtori.&quot; My head was pounding with all 
this. It was like a tale from my childhood &#150; something barely 
remembered. &quot;But Tenjou&#133;&quot; my voice was hoarse. &quot;What happened to her?&quot;

Anshi shook her head, tears cascading down her cheeks. &quot;I&#133;please.&quot; She 
swayed where she sat and I leapt to support her. On my knees I held 
her, while she groaned in frustration or pain. It was a long time 
before we moved.

And then the moment was gone. Anshi pulled away and her eyes were dry. 
I felt like my head was on fire, but my thoughts were clear and 
concise.

&quot;Anshi. I have to go to Ohtori.&quot; 

She looked at me, frowning. &quot;I know. I had hoped&#133;but then, if it comes 
to this, then this is what must be.&quot; She stood and smoothed her dress. 
I stood as well and walked her to the door.

She turned to face me, then leaned forward and placed a small kiss on 
my lips. &quot;Please be careful.&quot; After the door closed behind her, I 
touched my lips where she had kissed me. I could feel her in my arms 
the whole way home.
