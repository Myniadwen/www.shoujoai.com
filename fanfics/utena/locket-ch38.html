Mara was up on the karaoke stage, singing in a duet with Urd. The two 
women sang pretty well together, their voices blending quite neatly, 
but there was an undercurrent of sorrow, too. It was almost as if both 
of them knew that what they had, it just couldn&#39;t last.

&quot;What is the world coming to, with a devil kissing an angel?
A kiss that rips open the heart, manipulates gentleness.

But if you can hold on to something,
Go on outside, it&#39;ll be OK!&quot;

Mara sang the first bit on her own, then Urd joined her with singing 
the chorus.

&quot;Scream &#39;Love&#39; to someone in your own way,
Swear &#39;peace&#39; to someone, that is bravery!&quot;

They left the stage together, holding hands. &quot;Interesting choice of 
song,&quot; Mara said, looking admiringly at the white haired goddess who 
walked at her side.

Urd smiled a bit sadly, gesturing Mara to a seat at their table. She 
smiled over at the brown haired demoness, &quot;My... superiors have found 
out about us.&quot;

Mara&#39;s hand hesitated, then she continued to raise her glass to her 
lips. A long pull of her sake, then, &quot;Mine have, as well.&quot;

Softly, Urd said, &quot;I&#39;ll renounce my godhood.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Mara blurted out. Her eyes were dark as she continued, &quot;You&#39;d 
miss your sisters too much, you know that!&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t lose you,&quot; Urd said softly, her voice intense.

&quot;I&#39;m already lost,&quot; Mara said softly back. She squeezed Urd&#39;s hand, 
&quot;You know that, even if you&#39;re not willing to admit it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so damn unfair,&quot; Urd muttered softly, her shoulders slumping.

&quot;I know,&quot; Mara agreed.

They sat there quietly for a few moments. They had known each other 
for years, since they were kids, but it wasn&#39;t until Urd had nearly 
died that they had finally admitted to each other their deeper 
feelings. The rules, however, were absolute: a love affair between an 
Goddess and Demon was absolutely forbidden.

Mara smiled slightly, nodding to the stairs that lead to the suites 
for rent upstairs. &quot;Do you want to, one more time?&quot; she asked.

Urd smiled back, a few tears glittering in her eyes, &quot;All right.&quot;

Juri shook her head sadly, watching the two of them go upstairs. It 
was obvious that something was wrong between them, but what, exactly, 
she didn&#39;t know. She leaned up against the bar, keeping an eye on the 
goings on in the locket.

A redheaded vampire leaned up against the bar, drinking a glass of 
blood and rum. Her eyes were dark, deeply pained somehow, a long black 
leather coat draped over her shoulders and covering a leather fetish 
dress underneath.

Juri&#39;s eyes widened as she recognized the vampire Willow, &quot;Oh hell, 
not her again.&quot;

Ryouko smiled, &quot;Actually, she hasn&#39;t caused any trouble tonight. Why, 
I don&#39;t know, but...&quot; The bartender shrugged eloquently.

Juri hesitated, but the lady seemed almost as if she was in pain. She 
moved over to Willow&#39;s side, &quot;Anything I can do?&quot;

With a surprisingly gentle smile Willow said, &quot;Sorry, not much.&quot; She 
raised her glass and slugged back the rest, adding, &quot;Unless you can 
absolve me of a decade of evil deeds.&quot;

Juri looked at her, and got the feeling she was dead serious. &quot;I can&#39;t 
really do that,&quot; she admitted. She signaled Ryouko, who delivered her 
a colored ginger-ale, then looked at Willow. &quot;Best thing I can suggest 
is try to balance the scales,&quot; she continued.

Willow nodded thoughtfully, &quot;That&#39;s what she tries to tell me, too.&quot;

&quot;She?&quot; Juri asked, trying to change the topic.

Willow actually smiled slightly, &quot;Buffy. I helped her defeat the 
Master a few weeks back, and we&#39;ve been working together ever since.&quot;

&quot;Master,&quot; Juri raised a eyebrow, chuckling as a evil thought occurred 
to her. Willow looked curious so she said, &quot;I suppose his first name 
wasn&#39;t Bator?&quot;

Willow put the two words together and made a face, &quot;That&#39;s bad.&quot;

Over at the entrance to the club itself Hitomi&#39;s eyes widened at the 
woman striding down the hall at her. She had short, boyishly blonde 
hair, blue eyes, and an intense look in her eyes, a look that normally 
meant trouble.

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Hitomi said cautiously, &quot;I&#39;m Hitomi.&quot;

&quot;Buffy,&quot; the young woman answered the girl softly, looking around her 
curiously. She pushed her hand through her hair nervously, looking 
much younger as she said to her, &quot;I&#39;m looking for a friend of mine.&quot;

&#39;Isn&#39;t everyone?&#39; Hitomi thought whimsically, but instead she just 
tried to look helpful.

&quot;She&#39;s a redhead, pale, and likes to wear leather,&quot; Buffy actually 
blushed a bit.

&quot;Willow, right?&quot; Hitomi asked cheerfully. At Buffy&#39;s nod she said, 
&quot;She&#39;s over at the bar, at least she was the last time I saw her.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Buffy moved out into the crowd. The women cleared the way 
for the intense young lady, and she soon saw Willow sitting at the 
bar, talking to another woman there. She was a bit surprise to feel an 
odd flash of emotion, a bit of jealousy.

&#39;I&#39;ve only know her for a few weeks,&#39; Buffy thought, surprised. But 
this was the first time she had really had a partner, someone who 
fought beside her, back to back. She certainly didn&#39;t have any claim 
on the vampiress, so why was she standing here wishing that the orange 
haired lady would just go away?

Juri looked out into the crowd, and smiled slightly. She looked over 
at Willow, &quot;This Buffy, is she a really intense looking, butch 
blonde?&quot;

Willow blinked, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

Juri discretely pointed, &quot;I think she followed you here.&quot; She got up 
and stretched, &quot;I think I&#39;ll go call my girlfriend.&quot; With that, she 
left.

Buffy sighed in relief, settling down in the seat Juri had vacated. 
She smiled at Willow nervously and blurted, &quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot;

Willow looked at her friend, softly answering, &quot;She works here, and 
was making sure I wasn&#39;t going to be trouble.&quot;

Buffy puffed out a breath, looking relieved as she said, &quot;Oh, good.&quot;

Willow raised her eyebrow at that.

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Ryouko is from the series Tenchi Muyo. And finally, Hitomi is 
from Escaflowne, the movie.

Our Cast This Episode: Mara and Urd are from Oh My Goddess. And Willow 
and Buffy are from Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the Alternate Sunnydale).

Authors Notes: There is nothing solid in the Oh My Goddess manga that 
spells out a relationship between Urd and Mara, but boy is it implied 
though several of the storylines. At the very least, they&#39;re a lot 
closer than they should be, considering their jobs.

The song that the two of them sang is &quot;Akuma to Tenshi no Kiss&quot; or 
&quot;Devil and Angel&#39;s Kiss,&quot; from the original Bubblegum Crisis. I copied 
the words from the Hurricane Live 2033: Tinsel City music video, so if 
I got any words wrong, just blame Animego...

Vampire Willow and her Buffy are from Part Six of my Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer fanfic, Itsumo means Forever. I always thought Willow and Buffy 
would make a cute couple. ^_^ </pre>
