<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bshbreload-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The dark night faded to daylight, then night came to
Ohtori Academy once again. In her silent room in the
abandoned dorm Utena smiled to herself dreamily, the
sensation of warmth all around her naked body. She
snuggled down on the battered mattress, luxuriating in
the feeling, until something began to bother her.

&#39;Wait a moment,&#39; Utena found herself thinking as she
gradually came awake, &#39;my body doesn&#39;t hold warmth
like this anymore. What&#39;s keeping me warm?&#39; She opened
her blue eyes just a crack to look out, then Utena&#39;s
eyes suddenly popped open in surprise. She was buried
in the middle of a pile of naked young women!

&quot;Hmm, mistress,&quot; one sighed softly, shifting in her
sleep beside Utena, her perky breasts rubbing up
against Utena&#39;s cold skin.

Utena felt the warmth of the flesh pressed up against
her, and she could feel her fangs extending, hunger
rising even against her will. &#39;I have got to get out
of here before I do something I&#39;ll regret,&#39; she
thought to herself frantically. Thankfully, the moving
girls generated enough room for Utena to slip out
between them. She grabbed a uniform from her closet
then slipped out of the room as quietly as possible.
&quot;I can&#39;t believe they followed me,&quot; Utena sighed
softly. She had even recognized one or two of them,
like Nanami&#39;s friend Keiko.

&quot;You might want to get dressed,&quot; an amused voice
commented.

Utena was so distracted by her unexpected guests that
she hadn&#39;t even noticed that Anthy was waiting for her
out in the hall. &quot;How did they find me?&quot; she
questioned her, even as she quickly pulled her clothes
on.

&quot;The blood bond,&quot; Anthy sighed. &quot;It links you to them
as well, Utena,&quot; she explained, &quot;and it&#39;s unbreakable
except by your death.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll save staking myself as a final alternative,&quot;
Utena shot back, something in her tone showing she
wasn&#39;t entirely joking as she pulled her shirt, then
the jacket. &quot;Are you sure there&#39;s no other way to free
them?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;I&#39;ll look into it,&quot; Anthy said. She noticed the hint
of fang as Utena talked, and felt obligated to ask
her, &quot;Are they all right?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t fed yet, if that&#39;s what you mean,&quot; Utena
said with a bit of anger in her voice, offended that
Anthy might believe she had drank from the girls.
&#39;Though I did that once before,&#39; she thought a bit
guiltily.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice had a hint of apology in
it.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Utena conceded, feeling the need
rising within her. She looked at Anthy, almost able to
hear the blood pumping through the girl&#39;s veins then
shook herself, surprised at how much she wanted to
walk right over and take the dusky skinned girl. &quot;I&#39;m
going out to hunt,&quot; she said, striding towards the
window.

&quot;Wait, you may not be able to... ,&quot; Anthy started to
say, but Utena had disappeared into the night. &quot;Damn,&quot;
she cursed softly.

Utena loped across the campus towards the forest,
towards food. The scents she had learned over may
weeks drew her onward, and nearly silently Utena
stalked through the dark woods, letting her unnatural
senses guide the way. &#39;Here,&#39; she thought, as the rich
scent filled the nostrils. She gently parted the
branches, and nearly gasped in surprise.

Kozue Kaori lay tangled up with a paramour in the
forest clearing, the sweat drying on their slick
bodies. A bit of his blood has spilt on the ground,
raking tears across his bare back from her nails and
that very same scent filled Utena&#39;s nostrils. Kozue
looked up drowsily at Utena then her eyes widened,
seeing Utena standing there in the shadows. Gently
easing the young boy aside she softly whispered,
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Meeting that hungry gaze Utena found herself moving
forward involuntarily, and stopped herself. &quot;Nothing,&quot;
she turned away, disappearing into the shadows.

Kozue lay there, thoughts racing as a fire pulsed
within her slim body. &#39;Somehow I doubt that,&#39; she
though, grabbing at her clothes and roughly waking up
her partner, thoughts racing.

Striding away into the darkness, Utena was deeply
confused. &#39;I was hunting animals, not...&#39; Utena
thought to herself dazedly, &#39;Why did I...&#39; she shook
herself. With fresh determination she stalked the
woods, eventually finding what she really sought: a
deer. The kill was done as mercifully as possible,
then Utena bent to feed, burying the fangs into it&#39;s
flesh.

Only to suddenly choke on the first spurts of blood.
She spat loudly, trying to clear the stuff from her
mouth as quickly as possible. With a shaking hand she
cupped some of the animal blood to drink again, and
discovered the same foul taste. &quot;I can&#39;t drink it,&quot;
Utena murmured, then in a tortured cry into the
darkness, &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot;

Back at the dorm, things were getting interesting.
&quot;Where is the mistress?&quot; the young woman demanded of
Anthy, &quot;I can feel she&#39;s in pain!&quot; The other young
ladies, all milled around restlessly, looking for
their mistress, Utena.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Anthy started to say, when Utena
herself walked down the hallway towards the room. She
looked terrible, her uniform dirty, animal blood
smeared down the front. But it was the despairing look
in Utena&#39;s eyes that most shook Anthy.

&quot;Leave us alone,&quot; Utena coldly ordered the girl
groupies, and they obediently went back into the dorm
room. Anthy took a step towards Utena but she raised a
hand to stop her. &quot;I don&#39;t trust my self control right
now,&quot; Utena said to her with a sigh. She met Anthy&#39;s
eyes, &quot;I couldn&#39;t feed, the deer&#39;s blood tasted foul.
What&#39;s happened to me?&quot;

&quot;I tried to tell you before,&quot; Anthy said softly, her
heart going out to the bedraggled young woman who was
standing there before her. Bedraggled, and strangely
sexy with that feral hunger about her. &quot;You never fed
on human blood before last night,&quot; she said to Utena
softly, &quot;so your body was used to only having the
animal blood. But once you tasted human blood for the
first time, your body chemistry changed.&quot;

Utena was shaking her head, her expression despairing
as she asked, &quot;I can only feed on human blood now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Anthy said softly.

&quot;Stake me,&quot; Utena whispered softly, eyes closed in
pain.

&quot;What?&quot; Anthy asked, unsure of what Utena had just
said.

&quot;Stake me!&quot; Utena loudly demanded of Anthy, as a
single blood red tear ran down her pale face. &quot;I won&#39;t
become a parasite like Akio and the others,&quot; Utena
softly vowed, &quot;and this is the only way to prevent
that!&quot;

&quot;But what about the other vampires that Akio may have
created?&quot; Anthy asked her, trying to reach past the
despair she heard in Utena&#39;s voice, feeling a bit
surprised at how much she was concerned for the lovely
vampire.

The pink haired woman paused, stiffening. &quot;The only
way I can live, now,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;is to feed
off of human beings.&quot; She met Anthy&#39;s eyes again to
ask, &quot;Is destroying Akio&#39;s creations really worth
that?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Anthy said to her honestly. Not letting
herself reconsider she unbuttoned her sleeve before
rolling it back to reveal her arm, &quot;Take what you
need.&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes widened, she saw the fangs gleam
as Utena clenched her jaw, fighting for control.

&quot;Don&#39;t feed from her,&quot; the quiet voice said softly,
&quot;feed from us.&quot; The naked young woman led her five
fellows out, surrounding Utena. &quot;We serve you in all
things, m&#39;lady,&quot; she said to her evenly, then taking a
blade from behind her back she slit the flesh of her
arm.

The blood fountained, and before Utena could even
think about resisting the hunger she was upon her. The
other thralls drew the feeding pair into the dorm
room, leaving Anthy hesitating in the hallway. &quot;She&#39;ll
be fine,&quot; Keiko reassured her, her long brown hair
flowing free before she turned to go in after them.

Utena lapped at the red blood, guilt crushing in as
the tall, dark haired girl drew her backward towards
the waiting bed. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she said as the
nude young woman drew her down, the other girls
helping them climb onto the bed.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Utena managed, her voice coming out
husky.

She drew Utena close, a supple grace to her movements.
&quot;My name is Motoko Aoyama,&quot; she murmured, full breasts
pressing into Utena&#39;s own, &quot;my Mistress.&quot;

Utena moaned, blood still gently flowing into her
mouth as hands began to tug her dirty uniform away,
striping her naked relentlessly. One hunger had eased,
but Utena was shocked as another need rose up in her.
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t....&quot; Utena murmured, gazing into
Motoko&#39;s gentle eyes.

&quot;I want to,&quot; Motoko answered as she drew gently
Utena&#39;s bloody mouth away from her wound as they
slipped into a hungry kiss.

Bare flesh pressed close from all sides as the sweet
scent of female in heat rose up all around. A blue
haired girl smiled a bit sheepishly as the girls drew
close, her glasses gleaming as she explained, &quot;When
Touga fed we would all comfort the chosen one, give
her pleasure.&quot;

Keiko looked at Utena hungrily, &quot;Will you join us,
Mistress?&quot;

Utena let her hand slide down from Motoko&#39;s shoulder,
cupping a full breast as the other girl moaned softly.
&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed, tongue sliding out to stroke across
salty flesh, letting her other hand sliding down to
stroke across delicately wet flesh.

&quot;I think I like her better,&quot; a little blonde sighed
happily as the girls piled on....

Outside in the hallway Anthy nervously waited, a faint
blush coloring her cheeks as she listened to what was
going on in there. &#39;What are they doing?&#39; she
wondered, a particularly loud cry making her blink in
surprise.

There was the sound of footsteps, then a familiar
looking young woman strode down the hallway, her eyes
sultry in the dim light. &quot;Looks like I missed the good
part,&quot; Kozue murmured, her blue hair falling into her
eyes.

&quot;Wakaba said you knew about Utena,&quot; Anthy said
reluctantly, disturbed a little by the girl&#39;s sexual
aura. She didn&#39;t just look sexy, she looked...
seductive.

&quot;I saw Utena out in the woods earlier,&quot; Anthy was a
bit surprised to hear the honest concern in the girl&#39;s
voice as Kozue continued, &quot;she didn&#39;t look good.&quot;

&quot;I think she&#39;ll be fine now,&quot; Anthy answered with a
blush as yet another wanton cry came from behind the
bedroom door.

&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Kozue agreed impishly.

Utena emerged from the dorm room only a few moments
later, dressed in a clean school uniform once again.
She looked a bit better now, her blue eyes were less
wild and dangerous, but a bit of light pink was around
her lips. Along with the peace, though, was a odd
sense of danger, as if something unpredictable had
been fully unleashed.

&quot;The girl&#39;s resting,&quot; Utena said softly, an odd look
on her face. She looked... completely satisfied, maybe
for the first time since Anthy had met her.

&quot;Do you mind if I?&quot; Anthy asked, looking towards the
bedroom door. Utena just gave her a shake of the head
that Anthy took as a permission. She pushed open the
door, then stopped cold at the conversation she heard.

&quot;She&#39;s so much better than Touga,&quot; one girl sighed the
other.

&quot;Hmm, that was wonderful,&quot; Motoko sighed happily,
sprawled in the middle of the bed. &quot;She was firm, but
oh so gentle, too.&quot;

&quot;And she drank much less than Touga did,&quot; another
noted.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m merely tired,&quot; Motoko agreed.

A merry laugh from the blonde, &quot;We&#39;re all tired, but
not for the same reason. I didn&#39;t know Utena could be
such a lover....&quot;

&quot;I wonder when my turn will be?&quot; and a wistful sigh.

Anthy closed the door without going inside, a faint
blush on her cheeks.

&quot;Well isn&#39;t that cute,&quot; Kozue murmured softly, having
heard at least some of the girl&#39;s conversation. Her
eyes lingered on Utena, taking in that slim athletic
figure, and she wondered how she might join in that
lucky group.

Utena saw it, and a slight smile tugged at her lips.
&quot;Thank you for being worried, Kozue,&quot; she finally
said, feeling a uncomfortable stirring within her
sated form, her body responding to the other girl&#39;s
unrestrained sexuality.

&quot;I&#39;d be glad to help,&quot; Kozue answered honestly, a
wicked smile teasing her lips as she thought of the
ways she&#39;d enjoy helping Utena.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena smiled back wryly, something in her
eyes showing she understood that entirely unspoken
message. She became a bit more serious as she gently
drew the two women away, walking with them down the
hallway. &quot;There&#39;s something I&#39;m starting to be a bit
worried about,&quot; Utena said softly.

Anthy fought back a jealous frown at how closely Kozue
stood to Utena, how the girl carefully turned so that
her full figure was so prominent. &quot;There&#39;s something
else?&quot; Anthy said, looking a little bit startled. It
seemed that everything that had been going on over the
past few nights was beginning to catch up with her.

&quot;Someone, actually,&quot; Utena said softly. The trio
reached a window, and paused there for a moment. Anthy
looked up at Utena, her pale body lit by the
moonlight, looking more like a statue than a former
human being. She looked so utterly remote, yet the
faint scent of sexual musk that still clinged to her
showed that she felt those all too human hungers.

&#39;She is beautiful,&#39; Anthy admitted to herself. &#39;Too
beautiful, maybe,&#39; she smiled, thinking of her own
fading resistance to that beauty, feeling a hunger to
be dominated by her barely restrained power. &quot;Who?&quot;
she asked Utena, looking away from her and out into
the night.

&quot;Akio, our not so dearly departed vampire, had a
girlfriend named Kanae,&quot; Utena coldly noted.
&quot;According to Wakaba, nobody&#39;s seen her since before I
slew him,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;You think that he turned her, too?&quot; Anthy asked her,
unconsciously fingering a wooden stake hidden in her
clothes.

&quot;Seems likely,&quot; Utena sighed.

&quot;Kanae&#39;s reclusive, she&#39;ll be hard to find,&quot; Kozue
remarked, leaning forward with a unconscious kind of
sexiness.

&quot;True enough,&quot; Utena conceded. Her eyes widened, and a
smile tugged at her lips as she whispered to Anthy,
&quot;Brace yourself.&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba shrieked happily, and glomped
her. Utena staggered about the hallway a moment, and
Anthy found herself laughing.

&#39;She knew it was coming,&#39; Anthy thought as she
remembered Utena&#39;s warning to her. She smiled as she
watched the two friends play, but it was a bittersweet
moment. Someday soon, Utena might be truly dead, or
maybe in some eternal self exile.

&quot;Kozue!&quot; Wakaba blinked, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Kozue met Wakaba&#39;s eyes, a gentle warmth in them that
seemed so different than the hunger that normally
shone forth, &quot;I did say I wanted to help.&quot;

&#39;She cares for Wakaba,&#39; Anthy noted, &#39;is there no end
to this slut&#39;s surprises?&#39;

&quot;Utena,&quot; Wakaba said in a dangerous tone of voice,
&quot;what are all those naked women doing in your room?&quot;

Utena actually looked kind of stunned at her question.
It obviously wasn&#39;t something that she had even
thought about, trying to explain the new state of
affairs to Wakaba. She threw a desperate glance at
Anthy, silently crying out, &#39;Help!&#39;

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Anthy chuckled softly. &quot;You got yourself
into this, so you get to explain it,&quot; she said to her
firmly.
