<h1>A Special Case (part 16 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/special-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>I could feel the winter chill seep in through the window as I brushed 
my hair. It still seemed strange to me to see it. For ten years it had 
been black and short. I held up a lock of pink hair, as long as my 
shoulder and stared back at the face in the mirror.

&quot;Maybe I should cut it.&quot; I said out loud. 

&quot;I think you will look beautiful no matter what length it is.&quot; Anshi 
came in with a newspaper and handed it and a cup of coffee to me.

&quot;Did you see this?&quot; I asked her, pointing to a small article in the 
business section. She looked over my shoulder. &quot;It says that Kiryuu 
Touga has been sent to a spa in Switzerland for rehabilitation&#133;and 
Nanami has resigned, pending her move to New York.&quot;

Anshi took the brush out of my hand and began to brush my hair. &quot;Poor 
Nanami. I always felt bad for her, you know. She set herself up for 
disappointment all the time.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she&#146;ll finally work it out this time.&quot; I drank the coffee and 
hummed with pleasure as Anshi brushed.

&quot;Juri called.&quot; Anshi said. &quot;She and Miiko will be coming to Kyoto for 
a shoot later this month. She was wondering if they could meet us for 
dinner.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;d like nothing better. Do you think, &quot; I asked a little hesitantly, 
&quot;we should invite Miki?&quot;

Anshi smiled at me in the mirror. &quot;I think that would be a nice idea.&quot;

She brushed my hair a little longer then handed the brush back to me.

&quot;Anshi?&quot; I looked at her reflection and our eyes met. &quot;What do you 
think the next ten years will be like?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know, Utena, but they&#146;ll probably be interesting.&quot; And she 
grinned. An honest-to-goodness mischievous grin. 

&quot;Yes, I said, grinning back. &quot;I guess they will.&quot;

End notes: Wow. That was a lot of fun to write! Probably the most fun 
of all of them so far. I have so many people to thank; I hardly know 
where to start.

First, let me say that this story began germinating at the moment I 
first watched the &quot;poison&quot; conversation in the TV series. I knew there 
was a story there&#133;and I wanted to be the one to write it.

Then I read &quot;Ten Years After,&quot; by Chris Davies and I knew that Juri 
was a lawsuit waiting to happen. So Miiko is for him. I hope he likes 
her.

Finally, I decided that writing a &quot;hardboiled&quot; mystery story would be 
fun &#150; and I was right. I think I may just have to write more of them.

All the places I mention in Kyoto are real. It sounds like a lovely 
city. Moti is real too, and does have a Shinjuku branch. I&#146;ll let you 
know how it is if I ever get to Tokyo.

I want to thank the members of the &quot;Fanfic Revolution&quot; who so 
carefully comb my stories for mistakes and inconsistencies and who 
never get tired of challenging me to defend my interpretations&#133;thank 
you all. I cannot possibly thank you enough, for the help, the support 
and the chitchat.

And I want to thank Pattie, because she means everything in the world 
to me.
