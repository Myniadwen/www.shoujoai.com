<h1>Victory's Spoil</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rukochan.html">Rukochan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Anthy, so quiet and reserved during the day, snored like a buzzsaw at 
night, much to the annoyance of her roommate, Utena Tenjou.

Utena peeked over the edge of the upper bunk down at the girl and gave 
an exasperated sigh. It was bad enough with Anthy, but Anthy&#39;s pet 
monkey Chuchu chimed along, his mouth open and drooling.

Utena flopped back down, staring up at the ceiling. Her life had just 
been too weird over the last few months. Unwittingly she had been 
dragged into the power-games of Ohtori Academy&#39;s student council, and 
had, in a fencing Duel, somehow won the game&#39;s prize pawn, Anthy 
Himemiya, the Rose Bride. Utena still didn&#39;t know the significance of 
the Duels, or Anthy&#39;s role as the Rose Bride, and Anthy wasn&#39;t 
offering any information.

Anthy would just give Utena her patented wide-eyed smile and say 
sweetly, &quot;Why, it means we&#39;re engaged, Miss Utena.&quot;

&quot;Would you stop saying that!&quot; Utena would argue. &quot;Why are you the 
Bride? Why do you have to do everything I say? And what&#39;s with the 
sword?&quot;

&quot;Those are the Mysteries; I cannot tell you.&quot;

And that was that. Utena and Anthy danced around the subject many 
times after that to no avail.

Anthy had also neglected to tell Utena about Akio.

Akio Ohtori was Dean of Students, and Anthy&#39;s older brother. Utena 
finally met him, and had been greatly impressed by his beauty. Like 
Anthy, he was dark-skinned, though his hair was a lighter shade of 
purple. He also exuded the same rose-scent that Anthy did, which 
reminded Utena of her childhood. Utena had been slightly flustered by 
this, and Akio took advantage of the situation and stole a kiss from 
her.

Utena reached under her pajama top, running her hand over her breasts 
and shivering slightly at the memory of Akio&#39;s lips on hers. As a 
child, she had been comforted after her parents&#39; death by a traveling 
Prince, who had enfolded her in a rose-scented embrace and kissed her 
tears away. Was Akio her Prince...? There was something about him that 
made her weak-kneed when she looked at him. She gently pinched her 
nipples, and gave a little gasp.

Well, she was having trouble sleeping anyway; she decided to indulge a 
bit.

She slipped her other hand down her pajama bottoms as well, reaching 
between her legs. She was already wet thinking about Akio; she slipped 
a finger between her folds, seeking her clit. Her fingertip found it, 
sending a little jolt of pleasure through her, and she gasped again, 
louder.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Miss Utena, are you all right?&quot;

She froze, then turned her head to see Anthy&#39;s own night-capped head 
gazing sleepily at her. Utena could feel the blush go to her toes.

Anthy put on her glasses, then looked at Utena again. &quot;Miss Utena, are 
you masturbating?&quot;

Utena wanted to hide; Anthy picked the worst times to be 
straightforward.

Anthy climbed to the upper bunk and knelt at Utena&#39;s feet, and began 
tugging at Utena&#39;s pajama bottoms.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Utena grabbed the waistband just in time. &quot;Anthy, what the hell 
are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Why, I&#39;m going to do my best to relieve you; I&#39;m your Bride after 
all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sick of hearing that!&quot; Utena barked, wrenching her legs out of 
Anthy&#39;s reach. &quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to do everything I say or even imply!&quot;

Anthy gazed at Utena levelly. &quot;Miss Utena, you&#39;re always asking me 
what I want. As the Rose Bride what I want most is to make the person 
I&#39;m engaged to happy,&quot; she said softly, crawling forward. She 
unbuttoned Utena&#39;s pajama top, then took hold of one of Utena&#39;s 
breasts. &quot;Let me pleasure you, Miss Utena.&quot;

Utena gasped as Anthy&#39;s mouth closed on her nipple.

&quot;Anthy, stop...&quot; she quavered, sounding unconvincing even to her own 
ears. &quot;This isn&#39;t right. I can&#39;t make you do this...&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t, Miss Utena,&quot; whispered Anthy. She pulled off Utena&#39;s 
pajama bottoms, and gently stroked Utena&#39;s thighs. &quot;I want to do this 
for you.&quot; She rested Utena&#39;s legs on her shoulders, and began to 
gently kiss along Utena&#39;s labia.

------------------------------------------------------------

Utena lay very still as Anthy&#39;s lips traced across her folds, and gave 
a soft moan as Anthy&#39;s lightly probing tongue came in contact with her 
clit.

Outside the haunted dorm, Kageshoujo Eiko and Kageshoujo Biiko stood 
silhouetted against a wall, Eiko with binoculars in hand and peering 
into the room Utena and Anthy shared.

&quot;Do you know?&quot; began Eiko. &quot;Do you really know? Have you heard the 
news? The Hero is finally tasting the spoils of her victory!&quot; She 
looked closer. &quot;Or rather the Bride is tasting the Hero...&quot;

Biiko grabbed the binoculars from her pigtailed companion to see for 
herself.

&quot;Oh, brave Hero!&quot; she piped, fending off Eiko, who tried desperately 
to get the binoculars back. &quot;Will she prove victor on this battle 
field as well?&quot;

Anthy ceased her lapping for a moment to look up at Utena as best she 
could through her fogged glasses.

&quot;Do you truly think this isn&#39;t right, Miss Utena?&quot;

&quot;Oh god, Anthy,&quot; Utena sighed, reaching down to run her fingers 
through the other girl&#39;s lovely purple hair. &quot;Don&#39;t stop on me now!&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Anthy said in her perkiest manner, then she began to work 
on Utena&#39;s clit; she suckled, nibbled, and licked until Utena was 
gasping and bucking her hips against Anthy&#39;s face.

Utena&#39;s face burned as words poured from her lips, urging Anthy on.

&quot;Oh Anthy, yes! Just like that. Lick me, my Bride, keep licking. Oh my 
sweet Bride!&quot;

Anthy trailed her tongue down over the pink inner lips of Utena&#39;s 
cunt, catching every droplet she could of the other&#39;s arousal. She 
returned to pay homage to Utena&#39;s clit, pressing and flicking her 
tonguetip under the hood, then she applied passionate kisses to it. 
Anthy then moved downward and inserted her tongue as deep into Utena 
as she could.

Utena quivered in Anthy&#39;s embrace, pointing her toes in ecstasy as she 
cried out.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;The Hero is succumbing to the skill of the Bride,&quot; said Biiko, 
shivering as Eiko reached into Biiko&#39;s panties. &quot;Poor brave Hero, to 
have lost!&quot;

&quot;But love is a different type of battle,&quot; remarked Eiko, making 
another grab for the binoculars while Biiko was distracted. She looked 
through them, rubbing her companion&#39;s mount in the meantime. &quot;Can 
there be only one victory in this case?&quot;

Utena sat up suddenly, making Anthy tumble back with a surprised 
squeak.

&quot;Miss Utena?&quot;

Utena said nothing; she gathered Anthy in her arms and covered the 
other girl&#39;s face and neck with kisses.

&quot;Oh Miss Utena...&quot;

&quot;Anthy, lovely as that is, I can&#39;t let you continue,&quot; Utena said 
softly; she laid Anthy down, lifting up Anthy&#39;s nightgown and removing 
her glasses again.

Utena straddled Anthy&#39;s legs, toying with Anthy&#39;s breasts with one 
hand and tugging gently at the nipples, while her other hand ran 
across the girl&#39;s belly.

Now it was Anthy&#39;s turn to gasp.

&quot;Here I am as your Champion, and I&#39;ve been neglecting you, haven&#39;t I?&quot; 
Utena used her knee to part Anthy&#39;s legs, rubbing it against her cunt. 
&quot;You keep this room spotless, you&#39;ve been making lunch for me, and all 
without complaint; let me do something for you, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Miss Utena, I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t let me do this?&quot; Utena grinned down at the dark-skinned girl 
squirming beneath her. &quot;I remember saying that

to you just a few minutes ago, and you blithely ignored me. Now it&#39;s 
my turn.&quot;

She leaned forward to kiss the girl, gently forcing her tongue into 
Anthy&#39;s mouth. Anthy&#39;s eyes widened, then closed as she opened her 
mouth to give Utena her own tongue. They kissed tenderly, Anthy&#39;s arms 
moving upward to shyly embrace Utena.

&quot;That is as it should be,&quot; said Eiko in Biiko&#39;s ear, handing her the 
binoculars to have another look, then turning her attentions to 
Biiko&#39;s breasts. &quot;Both the Hero and her Bride lovely as lilies in 
eachother&#39;s arms.&quot;

&quot;But nothing more than an unfortunate Duel can separate them,&quot; sighed 
Biiko. &quot;Don&#39;t you know? Don&#39;t you really know?&quot;

The smell of roses was almost overpowering as Anthy became more and 
more aroused, making Utena feel pleasantly dizzy as she lightly played 
her fingers along

Anthy&#39;s clit and labia. Utena tucked a random lock of her pink hair 
behind her ear, and pulled her lips away from Anthy&#39;s, flicking her 
tongue against Anthy&#39;s lower lip.

&quot;If you are my Bride, I need to treat you as such, don&#39;t I?&quot; she said, 
sliding a few fingers into Anthy.

&quot;Miss Utena, yes...&quot; breathed Anthy, involuntarily raising her hips.

Utena rubbed herself against Anthy&#39;s leg as she fucked Anthy slowly. 
&quot;I want to make you come, Anthy.&quot;

Anthy moaned, turning her face into the pillow her head rested on. &quot;Oh 
Miss Utena... I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you have to do whatever your Champion says?&quot; whispered Utena.

Anthy bit her lower lip. &quot;Yes, Miss Utena... But...&quot;

&quot;Can you come with me then?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes, Miss Utena,&quot; stammered Anthy, gazing up at Utena with almost 
gratitude in her eyes.

Utena was struck by how pliant Anthy seemed beneath her, yielding and 
fragile, and was seized by the urge to possess her completely. She 
thrust her fingers quicker, slamming her palm against the girl&#39;s clit. 
Utena felt her own orgasm growing in her lower belly and spreading 
outward, ready to unfold like some voluptuous flower; she rode Anthy&#39;s 
thigh furiously, her eyes shut and lips parted.

&quot;Miss Utena,&quot; cried Anthy, clenching Utena&#39;s shoulders tightly and 
arching her back. &quot;I&#39;m... oh..!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Anthy,&quot; hissed Utena. &quot;I&#39;m almost there; come with me.&quot;

They climaxed simultaneously, and so Utena, concentrating on her own 
pleasure for the moment, was unaware that Anthy had cried out her 
brother&#39;s name as she came.

When Utena came back to herself, she slowly removed her fingers and 
licked them clean. She pulled her pajamas back on, then snuggled down 
next to Anthy, kissing Anthy&#39;s neck.

&quot;Stay in my bunk tonight, Anthy,&quot; whispered Utena, drawing

the other girl into an embrace.

&quot;Yes, Miss Utena,&quot; murmured Anthy, yawning delicately as she 
straightened out the hem of her nightgown. &quot;I&#39;m glad I was able to 
please you.&quot;

&quot;Hush.&quot; Utena stroked Anthy&#39;s hair. &quot;Go to sleep, my sweet Bride.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Anthy&#39;s breathing immediately became even as she fell into a deep 
slumber.

Utena wondered for a moment, then chuckled softly. Now if only she 
could somehow &quot;order&quot; Anthy to cease her infernal snoring as well.

Maybe this Duelist Champion thing wasn&#39;t so bad after all.

Sated, she lay listening to the building settle, and fancied she could 
see one of the dorm&#39;s supposed ghosts in a corner. Sighing happily, 
Utena closed her eyes, finally drifting off to dreams of red roses, 
white horses, and true-hearted friends.

Akio stood in the darkness and narrowed his eyes at the sight of Anthy 
curled in Utena&#39;s arms.

This was an unexpected development, and would have to be dealt with...

He took his cellphone out of his pocket and dialed, waited and said 
softly into the mouthpiece, &quot;Kiryuu? You know who this is; you and 
your precious student council need to act quickly, or End Of The World 
will find other Duelists to do its bidding. Yes. You had better.&quot;

Then he hung up, his perfect lips curling into a smirk.

------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, this wasn&#39;t a story so much as a drawn-out sex scene. But did 
you like it? Let me know!</pre>
