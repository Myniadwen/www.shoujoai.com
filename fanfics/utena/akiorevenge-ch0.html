<h1>Akio's Revenge (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ggunsailor.html">Ggunsailor</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I happen to be a big fan of Utena (Utena and Anthy forever!!!!), and 
I&#39;ve always wanted to do a fic about her, and a Lemon on her and Anthy.

A few things before we get started. One, this takes place two years 
after the manga. Utena has left to go to Holland with her aunt, but now 
goes to Tokyo University, and the Council is reformed (meaning they&#39;re a 
real student council).

Two, they still duel,but just for fun, and Anthy isn&#39;t the prize 
anymore. They duel for priveleges like using the private pool and spa 
{that&#39;ll show up in a later chapter ;) }, etc.

And Three, there is a new character I created.
Here are his statistics.
NAME: Ukoji Hakata, senior
AGE: 19
HT: 7&#39;4&quot;
WT: 111
Birth date: 12/28
Hair color: Reddish-black, short-curly
Eyes: Blue-green
Council position: Secretary, 6th officer, technique specialist, and duel 
scribe
Activities: Council, calligraphy, archery, fencing, art, &amp; martial arts

When I say &quot;technique specialist&quot;, he&#39;s the guy who watches the duels 
and draws and writes down the speed, the agility, and the movements of 
the duelists (hence &quot;duel scribe&quot;). He gleans the info to create 
techniques used by the Council.

He is the one who clues Utena in on the Council rituals, and teaches her 
techniques. He becomes best friends with her &amp; Anthy, and lives with 
them in the dorm (his room&#39;s two doors down from theirs). His father and 
Touga&#39;s father helped found the Academy. Akio and Anthy&#39;s father was his 
dad&#39;s brother, so that means Ukoji, Akio, and Anthy are cousins!!!

He writes this story when he becomes the Chairman.

Enjoy!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to write this down, or I&#39;ll forget it. It&#39;s been so long, yet I 
can still remember every detail, everything so well... strange, isn&#39;t 
it? I&#39;m supposed to be the one with all the answers-I mean, I&#39;m the 
Chairman.

One morning ago, after my morning routine of fencing, then breakfast, I 
went to my office, sat at my desk, and did my job as Chairman of Ohtori 
Academy: answering phone calls, talking to to unruly students, etc.

As I finished a letter to the staff, my secretary came in with my mail. 
I&#39;d just thrown away a junkmail for a magazine subscription when I 
found, between a late Christmas card and a phone bill....something I 
hadn&#39;t seen in years.

My hands shook as I picked up the familiar envelope with the rose seal. 
I opened it, and a scent of roses filled the room. How I had missed it! 
How many memories came with it!

&quot;Pretty. What&#39;s that smell? Smells like--&quot; My secretary trailed off when 
she saw my face had turned paper-white.

&quot;Chairman! Are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Leave.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure? Do you want me to call a doctor?&quot;

&quot;Leave!&quot;

As the door closed, I slumped into my chair. Taking out the letter, I 
read the words typed in black ink:

&quot;Never forget what happened.
Always remember the forgotten past.&quot;

For the rest of the day, I could think of nothing else except that 
letter.

When I went back to the old dorm hall-turned Chairman&#39;s mansion(Akio&#39;s 
had been... well, you&#39;ll find that out later), so many memories of 
duel&#39;s, castles, roses, princes and princesses filled my mind so much, I 
couldn&#39;t eat my miso soup, which is my favorite.

Those words...I pondered what they meant well into the night.

Maybe it was a joke...maybe it wasn&#39;t.

I tried to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t. I needed to get some air.

As I walked out onto my balcony, the air was heavy, and the sky&#39;s 
background was dark with clouds, meaning it would be a drencher storm. 
Probably hit tomorrow.

I have no idea how long I stood out there, listening...just listening. 
When a distant rumble of thunder sounded, I smiled.

&quot;All right, all right. I&#39;ll take that as an answer.&quot; I turned and went 
back inside, sliding the glass door shut.

As I finally slept, I knew what I had to do.

The next day, I called in sick, telling them I&#39;d caught the flu, be out 
for a week, assistant Chairman will help, any problems, call me, yes 
I&#39;ll drink lots of fluids, and yes I&#39;ll get plenty of rest. I left a 
note for the postman, then went down to the wine cellar, and chose a 
fine bottle of sake.

I went into my study, locked the door, sat down at my desk, put paper in 
my typewriter, and, after pouring a glass of sake, began to write.

And here is what follows
