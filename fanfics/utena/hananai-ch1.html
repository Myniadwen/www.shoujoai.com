<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 1 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I became an Utena freak after viewing all 39 episodes RAW before it 
was in the states. So...I had to write a fic. I&#146;ve been working on 
this fic since the summer of 1999. Since starting, many projects came 
up and a serious case of writers block and then the unintentional 
disappearance of the drive on my hard drive has kept me from writing 
more. I just recently recovered my lost fic and I am going to complete 
it finally. I look back at it and think it isn&#146;t exactly my BEST work, 
but I am satisfied with it and that I probably could have done more 
with it, creatively and grammar wise, but hey, whatta ya gonna do. I 
just wanted to write!

There are some...&quot;adult&quot; themes involved in this fic, but sorry to 
disappoint all you lemon lovers, but this is not strictly sexual.

I thank Chiho Saito-sensei for creating Utena and inspiring me to 
pursue writing fanfiction after so many years of being away from it.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ohtori Gakuen; the spacious campus and huge buildings of one of the 
most authentic and prestigious schools around. Home of the Seitokai 
and duelists of Revolution. It&#146;s Kettou no Shioushia: Tenjou Utena, 
the young, pink-haired object of worship around the campus. Every 
girl&#146;s dream. Where Utena went, the persistent, female student body 
would follow happily, or at least the ones in her grade and below. A 
cheerful cry, a trademark &#145;Tenjou sigh&#146;, or an all out, loving &#145;glomp&#146; 
would be wherever the tomboyish girl roamed. 

Tomboyish? Yes, tomboyish. The exterior of the tomboy stuck to Tenjou 
Utena like glue, or like Shinohara Wakaba does to Utena&#146;s backside. 

&quot;Utena-sama! Good morning!!&quot; The ecstatic shout followed by an equally 
ecstatic glomp hit the pink-headed tomboy head on, or rather, from 
behind. 

&quot;Ah...! Oh...morning, Wakaba-chan.&quot; 

&quot;You&#146;re getting so strong, Utena-sama! I bet you could hold two of me 
by now!&quot;

&quot;Ahhh...I...I don&#146;t think so. One of you is good enough for me. I 
don&#146;t think my back could take it.&quot; The young princely wannabe laughed 
nervously as she held her best friend up on her back.

&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean!? Are you saying I&#146;m heavy!? 
Mouuu...that&#146;s not very nice, Utena-sama.&quot; Wakaba&#146;s lower lip trembled 
as she gripped tighter to the Oji&#146;s neck. &quot;I&#146;m not heavy! I&#146;m not, I&#146;m 
not, I&#146;m not!&quot; Her chestnut colored ponytail whipped back and forth 
and she shook her head quickly. An occasional &#145;Ack!&#146; escaping her 
blue-eyed friend&#146;s mouth. Before the shouting girl knew it, she was 
slowly going down, or rather, Utena was. 

&quot;Wa...ka...ba...aiiiiir....&quot; The now blue faced prince gasped for 
breath under her hyper friend&#146;s grip. 

&quot;Ah! I&#146;m sorry, Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba quickly got up from her sitting 
position on her friend&#146;s back and allowed Utena to breathe.

&quot;I&#146;m...sorry... &#145;bout that. I didn&#146;t...mean it like that.&quot; The color 
began to return to the glomped prince&#146;s face as she continued to gasp 
for air in the middle of her apology. 

&quot;Hmmmm....okay! I forgive you, Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba was quite amazing. 
The young girl could go from clinically depressed to overly hyper in 
2.3 seconds, flat. 

&quot;Here, Utena-sama. You dropped this.&quot; A thin, tanned, fragile looking 
hand picked up the Victor&#146;s school satchel and politely handed it to 
her.

&quot;Ah...thanks, Himemiya.&quot; 

Himemiya Anthy. Another important part of the strange game of 
revolution. The young, purple haired girl of sweet, chocolate colored 
skin played the role of Bara no Hanayome. This particular girl, 
this...Bride of the Rose...was the Kettou no Shioushia&#146;s &#145;prize&#146; in 
the duel game, instantly becoming &#145;engaged&#146; to him, but in this case, 
her. Throughout their &#145;engagement&#146;, a special relationship developed 
between the Victor and the Bride. One would call it sisterly 
love...another would call it a romance of lovers...Utena and Anthy 
call it a relationship of a prince that would protect and her princess 
that would be protected. A mere storybook romance in the eyes of it&#146;s 
beholders. 

Utena casually tossed her satchel over one shoulder and rested it 
there, another sign of her non-femininity. Her emerald-eyed fianc&eacute; and 
overly ecstatic best friend followed closely behind her.


Ohtori Gakuen was known for it&#146;s incredible architecture and high 
academics, but also for it&#146;s elite student council. It&#146;s Seitokaichou, 
Kiryuu Touga, on this morning, was escorting a younger boy through the 
campus to the office/planetarium of Ohtori Akio; the school&#146;s 
Rijichou. 

&quot;This is as far as I go. I have things I need to tend to. The Rijichou 
Shitsu is on the top floor.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot; The boy walked through the doors of the massive 
structure that housed the school&#146;s Rijichou and approached the 
elevator, a smirk crossing his features. The new boy wasn&#146;t exactly 
angelic in his appearance. He stood about an inch or two shorter than 
Touga, a semi-strong build, with piercing red eyes. His short mop of 
hair was midnight black with several thin strands of bangs colored 
white. Rebellious? Quite. This boy of a non-inviting appearance, came 
to this elite school dressed in a black T-shirt and a maroon, 
collar-less, shirt, only halfway buttoned down. The dress shirt was 
tucked in loosely on one side in his black pants and a pair of black 
and white street shoes graced his feet. With a ding, the elevator 
reached it&#146;s top floor destination, the doors opening to reveal a wide 
hallway lined with various sconces that held lights in them and a red 
carpet that stretched out in two directions: one going to a set of 
white double-doors that bore the school&#146;s rose signet; the other 
leading to another set of double-doors in a plain oak fashion. 

&quot;Well, here we go again...another school to get enrolled in and kicked 
out of. Whatta joke.&quot; The black haired boy laughed softly to himself 
as he raised his clenched fist and softly rapped on the door.

&quot;Come in, it&#146;s open.&quot; A casual and deep voice called. The boy cleared 
his throat and ran his hand through his hair before walking through 
the threshold.

&quot;Ohtori-san? Shintaro Keingo is my name.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know. We&#146;ve been expecting you. Now, don&#146;t think for a minute 
that your innocent act will work with me. I&#146;ve already crossed over 
your records and it seems you are quite the troublemaker. Be as it 
may, I have accepted you into my academy for one reason: the Bara no 
Kokuin that you bear on your left hand. I trust you received a letter 
concerning it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah, I did. How&#146;d you...&quot;

&quot;...know about it? Naturally, I knew. This school is known to bearers 
of that sign all over. Only the elite make it here to be a part of the 
Cache of the Rose. Now, your records are secure here. You&#146;ll be given 
a place in the Seitokai because of your knowledge of the duelists of 
World Revolution and you&#146;ll also be required to duel if need be. That 
is all. You&#146;re dismissed.&quot;

&quot;Uh, okay. Thanks, I guess.&quot; Keingo turned and began to exit out of 
the office.

&quot;Oh, and Shintaro-kun...do change into something more appropriate for 
school. I&#146;d hate for you to be hounded over the rules of our dress 
code.&quot;

&quot;Um...yes, sir.&quot; The elevator ding echoed in the hallway and the doors 
opened for Keingo to enter. On his way down, he couldn&#146;t help but feel 
a little embarrassed. &quot;Hmph. This seems completely pointless. No 
matter, I&#146;ll be outta this school in no time...but first...it&#146;s time 
to &#145;mingle&#146; with the student body...a female body preferably.&quot; A 
slight snicker escaped through his lips as he exited the elevator and 
walked to his assigned dorm to change. Out of the corner of his eye, 
he noticed a large group of girls all swarmed around the main gate. 
Another smirk crossed his disturbing features as he turned toward the 
flock of sighing and blushing girls. 

&quot;Good morning, Utena-sama!!&quot; 

&quot;Ah! Morning, Utena-sama!!&quot; 

&quot;Ahhhh, Tenjou-sama!&quot; Various shouts greeted the one called Tenjou 
Utena. Keingo seemed to go unnoticed to the girls...which only 
succeeded in frustrating the casual young boy. He walked a little 
more, trying to find this boy that the girls must be in love with. 

&quot;Hmph...can&#146;t be better looking than me. Poor boy...about to lose all 
his girlfriends.&quot; Keingo couldn&#146;t help but laugh to himself as he 
looked...but...where was this soon-to-be-single boy? He didn&#146;t see any 
males anywhere in this crowd. He looked to one girl and tapped her 
shoulder. &quot;Um...who are you screaming at?&quot;

&quot;You must be new if you don&#146;t know who Tenjou Utena-sama is.&quot;

&quot;Nope...don&#146;t know him. Can&#146;t be better looking than me, though. Am I 
right?&quot; Keingo&#146;s slick smirk warped drastically as the girl began 
laughing at him. &quot;What the hell are you laughing at!?&quot; 

&quot;You are new! Utena-sama isn&#146;t a boy!&quot;

&quot;Wha...!? You&#146;re hung up on a girl!?&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama isn&#146;t like other girls...she&#146;s...so...&quot; the young admirer 
stopped mid-sentence to release her &quot;Tenjou Sigh&quot; at her thoughts of 
the popular girl in her head. Keingo, on the other hand, felt anger at 
the thought of losing all the girls in school to another girl. 

&quot;No way! I won&#146;t have it! Where is this Tenjou-play &#145;boy&#146; at!?&quot; His 
red eyes flashed about the crowd and stopped instantly on a young, 
pink-haired girl in a boy&#146;s uniform. &quot;That one.&quot; As the other girls 
continued to greet Utena, Keingo pushed through the crowd and stopped 
in the young idol&#146;s path. She continued to casually wave back at the 
hopeless romantics around her, a blush staining her cheeks slightly, 
until she stopped abruptly, colliding with someone in front of her.

&quot;Ah...sorry about that...uhh...&quot;

&quot;Shintaro...Shintaro Keingo...grade ten.&quot;

&quot;Ah! Tenjou Utena...grade eight.&quot;

&quot;I know who you are and I can tell I may have some social competition. 
Stay out of my way, Tenjou. I refuse to lose my reputation to a 
wannabe boy.&quot; With that, he roughly brushed passed the confused 
duelist, pushed Anthy out of the way, and walked off. One of his arms 
went in the air in a parting gesture. &quot;See ya &#145;round, Tenjou-kun.&quot;

&quot;Whatta jerk. You okay, Himemiya?&quot; Utena&#146;s soft hand took her Bride&#146;s 
and raised her to her feet.

&quot;Yes, Utena-sama. Nothing I&#146;ve never had to deal with before.&quot;

&quot;That may be true, but you shouldn&#146;t need to deal with it at all.&quot; The 
young Victor bent over and picked up Anthy&#39;s satchel. &quot;Here. Don&#146;t 
worry about him. He&#146;ll adjust to his surroundings.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sure.&quot; The Victor lead her Bride through the crowd and began to 
walk to class. 

&quot;Ne, ne, Utena-sama!&quot; The familiar calling of Wakaba was heard from 
behind, only Utena wasn&#146;t in the mood for a glomping.

&quot;Yes, Wakaba? Sorry for not waiting. I just wanted out of there.&quot;

&quot;Who was that guy?&quot; 

&quot;Some new guy to the school I guess.&quot; Utena flinched at the thought of 
sharing a school with that jerk.

&quot;He&#146;s kinda cute. Ne, Utena-sama?&quot;

&quot;I think he&#146;s a conceited jerk.&quot;

&quot;Eh...? How come?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t even know him and he comes up and accuses me of being the one 
who&#146;ll ruin his reputation around school. Whatta bunch of crap! Then 
he pushes Himemiya on the ground!&quot; The Oji&#146;s teeth clenched and her 
carnation colored eye brows arched angrily at the thought of seeing a 
total stranger touch Anthy. 

&quot;Don&#146;t worry so much, Utena-sama. You said so yourself he&#146;d adjust, 
ne?&quot; The soft touch of Anthy&#39;s hand on her shoulder calmed the enraged 
prince instantly.

&quot;Yes, hi. Sorry about that.&quot; A sigh escaped her rose pink lips. &quot;Well, 
I guess we better get going. Classes will start soo-OOF!&quot;

&quot;Carry me, Utena-sama!! That&#146;ll take your mind off him!!&quot; Wakaba&#146;s 
weight hurt with the force, but Utena smiled warmly at her goodhearted 
friend.

&quot;Okay okay. Let&#146;s get going, Himemiya.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Fortunately, Wakaba&#146;s weight didn&#146;t slow the prince down and 
they all made it to class on time. An unbelievably good place to be at 
the school for now. A small grin curled the corners of Utena&#146;s lips at 
the thought of knowing that the jerk she met wouldn&#146;t attend the same 
class as hers, even though it meant he was an upperclassman.


The day went by progressively slow for Utena, no doubt, what with all 
the classes, study sessions, and basketball practice, but as soon as 
it was over, Utena met up with her young Bride and returned to their 
dorm with her, the sunset changing their surroundings a deep orange 
color.

&quot;Mouuu, school is too looong.&quot; Utena&#146;s limbs stretched out and yawned 
deeply.

&quot;Perhaps you should sleep more, Utena-sama. If you&#146;re not tired the 
day may not seem so long.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps they should cut the hours back, then the day won&#146;t seem so 
long.&quot; The crimson colored lips of the Bride turned upright at the 
Victor&#146;s comment. Even she, a polite and proper young girl, had her 
traumas and turmoil with school. Himemiya Anthy cared nothing of her 
academic achievements, but rather those of the Victor and her 
well-being. After all, the only thing the Bride is required to do is 
look after her Victor, right? In the chocolate-skinned girl&#146;s eyes, 
only Tenjou Utena mattered. But, is her dedication to her prince more 
than she, herself, can see? Is this the one person she could give her 
heart to and not have it brutally obliterated by the cruel twist of a 
fate that has plagued her for so many, many years? Be as it may, 
Tenjou Utena was a girl. A young, carefree, girl.

&quot;Hey...Himemiya...is everything all right? I lost ya there for a sec.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Utena-sama. I was...just thinking I guess. It&#146;s not important, 
really. Sorry about that.&quot; The emerald green eyes of her beloved Bride 
turned away as they entered the spacious dorm room. Utena dropped her 
satchel and kicked her shoes off, throwing herself lazily onto her 
soft bed. Anthy began idly making preparations for the evening&#146;s 
dinner as she usually did each day, though unusually early.

&quot;Hey, Himemiya, you don&#146;t have to do that right now. It can wait. We 
don&#146;t really need to have dinner for quite some time.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Utena-sama. What should I do for you then? It&#146;s a very 
uneventful day.&quot;

&quot;Himemiya, you know it bothers me when you insist on pleasing me all 
the time. I don&#146;t need to be waited on, ya know.&quot;

&quot;I know what you said, but...but it just doesn&#146;t feel right if I&#146;m not 
doing something to please my Victor. I feel useless.&quot; Utena&#146;s eyes 
stared sadly at the young, troubled individual, her heart feeling for 
her.

&quot;Himemiya, don&#146;t say such things. You&#146;re not useless. I don&#146;t want you 
to spend all of your time trying to please me. I want you to take time 
for yourself, first. That&#146;s one reason I&#146;ve stayed with you for so 
long. Yes, I do have a wonderful friendship with you since we became 
&#145;engaged&#146;, but I want you to be yourself, not a slave.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll try, Utena-sama. I think I have been trying all along. I like 
making you happy.&quot;

&quot;You do that anyway. You don&#146;t need to have me lead you around like a 
puppet on strings to make me happy.&quot; Utena&#146;s interpretation did make 
sense to the Bride, but still, Himemiya Anthy could tell that her 
Victor just didn&#146;t understand.

&quot;All right, Utena-sama, but if I&#146;m going to be myself, you&#146;re going to 
have to allow me to serve you sometimes because doing so makes me 
happy. Okay?&quot;

&quot;Ah...sorry, Himemiya. I never actually thought of it that way. If it 
truly, honestly, makes you happy, then I won&#146;t stop you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Utena-sama.&quot; The sweet, calm, and serene smile that Anthy 
flashed instantly warmed Utena&#146;s heart. Himemiya herself was a warmth 
in the Victor&#146;s heart that stood undeniable over anything else. Was 
this what some people called love? Or was this merely the deep 
friendship that a child may have as she grows-up with someone close? 
Utena&#146;s deep blue eyes stared thoughtfully at the girl who sat across 
the room, her backside turned to her, a kerchief atop her head to hold 
back any loose strands of midnight purple from falling in her eyes, 
and a neatly folded cloth in her delicate hands... nimble 
hands...hands that shouldn&#146;t be strained in such a fashion as 
scrubbing floors for no particular reason. Those tanned colored hands 
should be in those of someone who cares for her...someone who can love 
her. Someone who can fulfill all her deepest dreams as easily as they 
were imagined. At that time, Tenjou Utena found herself kneeling 
behind the fragile form of her beautiful Bride, her own arms reaching 
out to embrace the &#145;lonely child&#146; that stood inside and the &#145;young 
woman&#146; that was outside. Utena knew just with that embrace, what a 
life Anthy must have lived. A blooming red rose in a patch of weeds, a 
single star in a cloudy black sky. This was once Himemiya Anthy...but 
no longer. Himemiya Anthy of now was a red rose in a full bloomed rose 
garden, and a star that accompanied millions of others on a clear, 
moonlit night. This was the Himemiya Anthy that Tenjou Utena wanted to 
see at every passing second for the rest of her life. 

&quot;Utena-sama...what is it...?&quot;

&quot;Shhh...it&#146;s all right now. I told you...it&#146;s okay. You don&#146;t have to 
do that now.&quot; An ivory white hand reached to a deep tanned one and 
took the cloth from it, slowly tossing it aside. &quot;I&#146;ve been thinking 
deeply...and right now...this is how I want to see you always. 
Happy...and in the arms of someone who can love you.&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama...I...don&#146;t know...what...I&#146;m supposed to say to 
this...I...&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s all right...don&#146;t say anything if you don&#146;t want to. Just say 
what you feel. If you feel nothing...it&#146;s all right.&quot;

&quot;Is...it true...Utena-sama? You...want to see me in the arms 
of...someone who... loves me?&quot;

&quot;Yes...that&#146;s all I want to see. That&#146;s all I want to feel.&quot; The 
Bride&#146;s eyes glanced at Utena&#146;s arms and she suddenly heard the words 
again. &#145;...in the arms of someone who can love you...&#146; she heard it 
echo several times over.

&quot;Utena-sama...&quot; The emotion-wracked princess looked to her prince&#146;s 
hands that were folded idly on her flat stomach. &quot;...are you seeing 
what you want to see? I&#146;m in your arms...and that&#146;s all you wanted to 
see and feel...ne?&quot; Utena said nothing. She merely brought a hand 
around to remove the kerchief from her Bride&#146;s head and then release 
the waterfall of gleaming velvet from it&#146;s clasp. The prince moved 
aside for a moment to let the thick strands of hair fall loosely down 
Himemiya&#146;s back, then she moved back. Once again, her black-clad arms 
wrapped around her Bride, hands folding calmly on the girl&#146;s stomach. 

&quot;Are you feeling anything inside, Himemiya? Anything you&#146;ve wanted?&quot; 
The young prince&#146;s face rested in the silky locks of Anthy&#39;s head, 
taking in the exotic scent of Jasmine from the long tresses. 


&quot;I feel...I feel...loved.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s all I wanted to hear.&quot; 


Anthy&#39;s words shocked herself...did she really feel loved? Is this 
what love felt like? Is it different with girls than boys? If it 
was...she wanted only to have this beautiful girl with her and never 
let, even the most handsome boy touch her. Utena&#146;s words left her 
mouth softly as one single hand turned Anthy&#39;s head to her face... 
leaving the beautiful Bride open for her first...heartfelt kiss. Would 
it be right? Could it be wrong? Still hesitant, the soft, rose-pink 
lips met those of Anthy&#39;s crimson-rose ones in, not a mere kiss that 
said &#145;I like you, will you go out with me?&#146; or whatnot, it was a kiss 
shared by lovers who&#146;ve just realized how much in love they were. How 
in love were they? So much that Utena&#146;s small pink tongue penetrated 
the sweet tasting lips of Anthy, only to reach the other girl&#146;s soft 
tongue in a mouth to mouth dance of passion...nothing more...nothing 
less. Himemiya Anthy felt a soothingly warm hand brush lightly over 
her reddened cheek, holding her soft face gently. Another hand held 
hers tightly, their fingers entwined. It seemed no more than a minute 
before the sweet taste of the prince&#146;s lips left her own, both Victor 
and Bride staring at one another lazily, yet lovingly. 

&quot;Himemiya...I...ah...&quot; The prince stuttered nervously. What had she 
just performed? 

&quot;Utena-sama...I...I liked that.&quot;

&quot;You did? You aren&#146;t ashamed? Be honest with me. Please?&quot;

&quot;I did. I liked it a lot. Will...we ever do that...you know...again?&quot;

&quot;If it makes you happy, of course we can.&quot; For a long, silent, moment, 
they said nothing, until Utena inhaled deeply and tightened her hold 
on Anthy&#39;s hands. &quot;Himemiya...ai...ai...aishitteru. I&#146;ve always wanted 
to tell you. I&#146;m sorry it took so long. I always thought...that if I 
ever found the courage to tell you...you&#146;d be angry or ashamed 
because...because...&quot;

&quot;...you&#146;re a girl.&quot;

&quot;Y...yeah.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m all right, Utena-sama. I&#146;ve always had this feeling deep inside 
me that said there was more between you and me than we knew. Somewhere 
though, I regretfully admitted to myself that your gender was the 
reason I couldn&#146;t love you.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Do...you still feel that way? If you do, I&#146;m so sorry for not 
asking first. I didn&#146;t mean to make you angry or ashamed if I did.&quot;

&quot;No, No, Utena-sama. I&#146;m not any of those things. I&#146;m pleased.&quot;

&quot;Then...you aren&#146;t mad?&quot;

&quot;Of course not. I&#146;m very glad you kissed me...or else I would have 
lived in loveless regret over your gender. It doesn&#146;t bother me that 
you&#146;re a girl, it makes me love you just as much.&quot; Anthy&#39;s slender 
fingers traced the outline of Utena&#146;s face slowly, stopping every now 
and then to take in her prince&#146;s enchanting scent of sweet roses. 

&quot;I guess my dream of becoming a prince changed some of my views and I 
learned to love everyone. That makes me thankful for Dios-sama more 
and more. Had he not rescued me...I may have grown to become a sad and 
regretful person.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m thankful too, but I&#146;m more thankful for you. Aishitteru, 
Utena-sama.&quot; Anthy kissed her Prince once more before curling up in 
her embrace and closing her eyes, letting her own peaceful exhaustion 
consume her, placing her in a comforting sleep. Utena waited patiently 
until her Bride was sleeping before pulling a heavy comforter over the 
two and putting her arm back around Anthy, finally succumbing to her 
weariness and drifting to sleep.


&quot;You&#146;re awfully bold, Anthy. I never knew you had that kind of 
independence in you.&quot; From a crack in the door, Ohtori Akio had stood 
by and watched every act the two star-crossed lovers had performed. 
&quot;No matter, dear sister, your independence will soon be cut short. I 
will not allow Utena to free you, for I&#146;ll lose the chance to steal 
Dios from her.&quot; The lavender-headed Rijichou crossed the thresh hold 
of the Planetarium, the large rose crested doors slamming shut behind 
him. &quot;Tomorrow, Tenjou Utena shall be introduced to her new 
challenger.&quot;


Upon the first rays of the morning against her face, the majestic 
indigo-blue of Utena&#146;s eyes appeared. Looking around once, she saw her 
Princess, lying in her arms, basking in the sun streaks that broke 
through the unusually large window by their beds. A smile crossed the 
Oji&#146;s face at first glance. How beautiful the Hanayome looked, even in 
her sleep, the Victor barely had the heart to wake her.

&quot;Ne, Himemiya...wake up. C&#146;mon, open your eyes.&quot; Upon giving the 
slumbering girl a nudge, Anthy&#39;s emerald eyes parted, a tired moan 
escaping her lips. &quot;Morning, Himemiya. Sorry I had to wake you.&quot; The 
Bride sat up, extending an arm and stretching.

&quot;Good morning, Utena-sama.&quot; Anthy sat there, a hand running through 
her slightly tangled sea of velvet. The Prince sat up, taking the 
chance to kiss the Hanayome gently before rising from the bed and 
walking across the room. &quot;Ne, did you sleep well even with me lying 
there?&quot;

&quot;I was just fine. Couldn&#146;t have been better and I mean that, too.&quot; 
Their conversation died down a bit as the two prepared for school that 
morning. How naughty of two lovers being intimate on a school night. 
When they had finished, they walked into another room that had the 
usual pantry and table, where the two sat down to eat. Idle 
conversation was exchanged between them before Ohtori Akio walked into 
the room, looking the same as he always did. Morning person, go 
figure.

&quot;Oh. Morning.&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Onii-sama.&quot;

&quot;Ah, morning, Akio-san.&quot; The Rijichou poured himself a cup of the tea 
that Anthy had previously prepared and strode toward the two.

&quot;I suppose since I&#146;m here I&#146;ll inform you about this morning&#146;s 
gathering.&quot;

&quot;A student gathering?&quot; Utena&#146;s face slightly faltered. How she hated 
student gatherings. It was most difficult to listen to the Seitokai 
drone on and on about absolutely nothing that pertained to her.

&quot;Yes, a student gathering. We&#146;ll be inducting a new member into the 
Seitokai. I trust you&#146;ll be polite and show up, eh, Tenjou?&quot; A blush 
stained the Victor&#146;s cheeks. The last meeting she had skipped out on 
while the student body filed into the arena.

&quot;Ah, y...yeah. I&#146;ll be there.&quot; 

&quot;See that you are. A new councilman probably means a new duelist and 
as Kettou no Shioushia, it does concern you.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Rijichou.&quot; By now, he had finished, so he rose from his 
seat, placing his hand upon Utena&#146;s carnation colored head. 

&quot;Well, then, I&#146;m off. I will see you at the meeting.&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; The two girl&#146;s chided simultaneously as he walked away. The 
Victor suddenly lowered her head into her hand.

&quot;Mouuu...I haven&#146;t had a challenge in quite some time. A new 
councilman usually means trouble for me. They&#146;re all the same! They 
get in and the first thing they&#146;re eager to do is duel with me.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s all right, Utena-sama. I have faith in you and you should, too. 
There&#146;s absolutely nothing that can separate us, now.&quot;

&quot;I suppose you&#146;re right. Thanks, Himemiya.&quot; 


The school day kicked off right away with the announcement of the 
assembly the student body was required to attend. No matter, the 
idol-struck female brood still managed to line up and wait for the 
arrival of Tenjou Utena. Rain, hail, snow, sleet; the Tenjou 
Worshippers always managed to show up in the morning.

&quot;Ah! There she is!! Utena-sama, good morning!!&quot; As usual, a wave of 
schoolgirl cries and &quot;Tenjou Sighs&quot; rang out across the courtyard. It 
was slightly unusual that they were doing this today, though. Didn&#146;t 
any of them even notice how close Anthy was to Utena this morning. 
Why, the mysterious girl was clinging gently to her arm!

&quot;Don&#146;t they ever get bored?&quot; The tomboy asked as waved to the swarm of 
girls.

&quot;Utena-sama, you worry too much.&quot;

&quot;Demo...! I have you, now, so naturally it&#146;s gonna bother me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry about them. I understand, perfectly.&quot; Utena just sighed 
and continued to be crowded until she got to the door of the assembly 
hall. Once the two entered, an almost annoying group of girls followed 
them in, but the start of the announcements silenced them and allowed 
some silence to end the ringing in the Prince&#146;s poor ears. Kiryuu 
Touga stood before a podium and spoke.

&quot;Everyone, Good morning. The Seitokai have requested your attendance 
to announce the induction of our newest student councilman, Shintaro 
Keingo.&quot; Politely, the students applauded, some just ignored the whole 
deal, and some had their eyes parted to the size of saucers.

&quot;Wh...what!? Him!? He&#146;s the new Seitokai member!?&quot; Tenjou Utena wasn&#146;t 
exactly pleased to say the least. Anthy placed a comforting hand on 
Utena&#146;s thigh, silently telling her to calm down. &quot;Sorry, but how did 
that dumb jerk get into the Seitokai? He&#146;s here for one lousy day and 
he&#146;s a councilman? That isn&#146;t right!&quot; 

&quot;Shhh, Utena-sama, don&#146;t start a scene. You&#146;ll give away the Cachet of 
the Rose.&quot; Defeated, Utena sat down, her arms crossed childishly over 
her chest. At that time, Shintaro Keingo stood to accept his Rose 
Signet and make his speech.

&quot;Oh, morning. It&#146;s, well, quite honorable to be accepted this 
suddenly, but I&#146;ll enter the Seitokai, graciously. Everyone, thank you 
very much.&quot; Again, the students politely applauded the boy. Utena, 
though, sat there, her head propped up with one arm, mocking his 
speech by moving her lips silently. Though she was amused, Anthy 
lightly swatted the childish prince on the arm.

&quot;Sorry, but I just can&#146;t stand it.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, but don&#146;t make a fool of yourself in front of him, okay?&quot;

&quot;All right, all right.&quot; Utena sighed and thought to herself. &#145;This is 
gonna be one crappy day, I can tell already.&quot;


To the Shioushia&#146;s expectation, the day progressed incredible slow and 
dull. Typical, considering it was school, but more so than usual. Next 
to her, the Bara no Hanayome could tell her Prince wasn&#146;t thrilled 
with the day&#146;s events. The break period had ended some time ago and 
Utena was still upset. One hour left to go. Anthy sighed softly and 
pulled out a blank sheet of paper. With a tiny grin, she scribbled a 
message and folded it before avoiding the sensei&#146;s attention, then 
gently tossing it onto the bored girl&#146;s desk.

&quot;Eh? What...&quot; Utena looked by her open textbook to see the paper. 
Picking it up, she quietly unfolded it and began to read. 


Ne, Utena-sama,

Don&#146;t look so down. School is almost over and as soon as you come home 
from basketball practice, I&#146;ll make everything all better. Your day 
will end pleasantly.

Good luck, 

Anthy


Utena&#146;s head rose, her face lit up as all the blood rushed to her 
face. &#145;Pleasantly&#146;!? Does that mean...? The Prince looked to Anthy 
quickly, swallowing hard when she noticed the smile on the slender 
face of her &#145;Bride&#146;. It was then, that Anthy looked back, smiling 
softly, to the heart-stopped Oji, and placing a long, tanned finger 
over her, now, smiling lips.
