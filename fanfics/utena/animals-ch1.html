<h1>Wild Animals</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/altheakeaton.html">Althea Keaton</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  I remember the first time we touched. She was standing outside of the 
music room, with her hand on the doorframe... I had been watching Himemiya 
play the piano with Miki-kun and was just leaving to use the bathroom. 
Himemiya called out something to me, maybe asking me to take Chuchu with me, 
and I paused at the doorway to listen, resting my fingers against the frame. 
I think I must have cried out then; I wasn&#39;t expecting to feel the solid 
warmth of her fingers under mine. I blushed and stammered and begged her 
pardon a thousand times, but all she did was smirk at me. There was 
something strange lurking in her eyes, something taunting, almost teasing, 
in the curve of her lips. As I passed by her there should&#39;ve been room 
enough to pass without contact, yet her shoulder brushed firmly against 
mine. I still don&#39;t really know if it was all her doing or if I had some 
part in that unnecessary contact as well.
  The normal course of daily events doesn&#39;t usually lead us to be in the 
same place at the same time, so it was more than a week before I saw her 
again. Earlier I had attributed the embarassing racing of my heart to 
surprise and bewilderment. But this time, laying eyes on her again, I had 
nothing to blame it on. She made some snide comment about the blush that had 
risen to my cheeks that caused it to deepen. Again I fumbled with my words, 
so unsure of everything that it made my stomach shudder and twist. I 
remembered our first meeting, how I had thought I had indigestion, how I had 
gone and made a fool of myself. She really did look strikingly like her 
brother, but I felt like such a child saying it to her. Also, it was an 
exaggeration... I would still be able to tell them apart were they dressed 
the same. Kozue-san&#39;s eyes have a peculiar inner-darkness to them that 
Miki-kun&#39;s lack, a sort of animalistic hunger. Whenever I see her lick her 
lips I think of her separating flesh from bone with her tongue. Sometimes 
when I see her talking to one of her boyfriends I catch her looking at him 
as if she would like to devour him whole. I think someday she might try it. 
She called herself a wild animal once, and I believe her. I think she would 
chew off her limbs to free herself from a trap. I think she would eat 
another alive. I think there&#39;s very little that she wouldn&#39;t do.
  I heard some boys talking about her the other day. They were all comparing 
their relationships with her, bragging about how far they&#39;d gotten, laughing 
at those who hadn&#39;t gotten far. Short-lived relationships, all. The longest 
one was probably about a week and a half. Ridiculous boys. They don&#39;t care 
about her heart, just her body. As long as they can own her body for a short 
time, they are content to forget she has a heart. So like the Duellists. 
They play their own little game, passing her around like some false vision 
of a Rose Bride, not even taking turns, and all for what? There is no 
revolution in their game. There is no goal but to possess their &quot;Bride&quot;, 
even if only for one night. How cruel. Even wild animals have hearts. She&#39;s 
not some soulless creature, some beautiful Frankenstein&#39;s monster for them 
to have their way with. They want to own something that can never truly be 
owned. All she has to do is bare her teeth and them and look at them with 
that bloodlusting cannibalism in her eyes that I&#39;ve noticed there before and 
they&#39;ll be gone. They&#39;ll run off whimpering, fearing that she may bite their 
throats and drain them of their lives as they wish to drain her of hers.
  I think I would let her. I dream of it, sometimes. I dream I&#39;m standing in 
the woods in my pajamas, and she comes to me in a torn Rose Bride dress, her 
hair tangled and her face dirty. She leers at me and devours me with her 
eyes. I try to speak, but before I can, her lips are upon mine. I am 
startled at first, always startled at first, but her touch is so gentle and 
warm that I cannot help but sink into it, to return it. My face begins to 
burn; my heart pounds and I can feel sweat running down the back of my neck. 
She begins to kiss me harder, her hands clamped onto my face so hard it 
hurts. My lips begin to bleed. I whimper and try to pull away, but she holds 
me tightly, pressing our bodies together so fiercly I can&#39;t stand it. Her 
lips dig hungrily into mine, tearing the tender flesh with their every ounce 
of strength. She pulls away from me at last, smiling bloodily, stretching 
the cuts on her own lips so that it hurts just to see it. I hold a hand to 
my ravaged mouth and stare at her with teary eyes. My heart is racing so 
fast, too fast to be natural, more rapid than the beating of a hummingbird&#39;s 
wings. I can hardly breathe, and all I can taste is our hot, hot blood. Then 
her hands are on my shoulders and I don&#39;t care about anything else. Her 
slender fingers trace streaks of searing pain across my flesh with only the 
slightest touch, her breath whispering against my ear so that it tickles 
with fire, and all I can do is tilt back my head and gasp. Blood is sucked 
into my lungs, and her every touch is its own world of unimaginable agony, 
but I stand there almost motionless, my brutalized lips trembling, and love 
every second of it. The lightest touch of her tongue burns away a trace of 
flesh. A little deeper the next time and my neck is bleeding. I&#39;m in hell 
and all I can do is moan. I should scream. I should run, run away and never 
look back. But I don&#39;t. Her teeth press against my wounded neck and the most 
sound I can make is a soft cry, desperate and pathetic. Blood gushes; I can 
feel it pushing through the barriers of her lips sealed so tightly to my 
neck, running down my flesh, soaking into my clothes. I can feel my flesh 
tearing, yielding to her. She&#39;s eating me alive and I hope she never stops.
  I wake up there, sweating and aching and wanting to cry. Shame wells in my 
chest and I can&#39;t bear the look on Himemiya&#39;s face. She stopped asking me 
about it after a while, I&#39;d assume because I always gave her the same sort 
of replies, but the concern still lingers on her face. I suppose it&#39;s 
understandable... She tried to tell me about it once; she said I looked like 
I was trying to scream but couldn&#39;t, that I clawed at the air so helplessly 
and desperately that I looked like a trapped animal. She also mentioned some 
strange sounds I was making, but I could never get her to try to describe 
it. Just as I could never try to describe my dream to her. I think she would 
be appalled... I am appalled. I awaken trembling and ashamed every time. I 
sit up in my bed and pant for air, trying to quiet the shameful throbbing 
the dream always stirs in me.
  I shouldn&#39;t feel this way. I shouldn&#39;t long for her. I shouldn&#39;t have such 
dreams. A noble prince would not feel this way, would not dream this way, 
would not want for a crazed animal that could never want anything but his 
pain. Princes rescue princesses. They slay dragons and save kingdoms. They 
always dash in just in time to set things right. They do not dream of 
delightful tortures. They do not lust after inappropriate creatures. And 
they are not so selfish as to be absorbed by their own wants. I suppose I 
really can&#39;t be a prince. I suppose I really was just a fool to believe in 
such a childish fantasy. Real life is not princes and princesses and 
kingdoms in the sky. Real life is pain and pleasure and guilt and shame.
  I was always sheltered from this sort of thing. I lived in a dream world 
of soft colours and gentle breezes, of heroic deeds and chaste kisses. It 
wasn&#39;t until I touched her, sensed the animal in her blood that made her so 
real, that I woke up. I suppose one could say that I didn&#39;t wake up until my 
dreams changed. When my head touched the pillow and I dreamed such an 
intensely beautiful nightmare that I wept from pain and pleasure, I finally 
awakened from the sweet dream world I had been hiding in. When our hands 
touched, something changed inside me, something powerful, almost 
overwhelming. Finger brushed against finger and shoulder brushed against 
shoulder, and suddenly I found that the world was not as I had thought. I 
finally can grow, no longer confined to my ideal world, cramped into my 
ideal self. She smashed my delicate eggshell of a world with a simple touch 
and I was born, not as a prince, but as an animal, a human, destined to grow 
to match her strange new world.
