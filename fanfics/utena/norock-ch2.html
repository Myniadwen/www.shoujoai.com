It was another sold out show. One of their last few before they moved 
onto the next city. The band had been belting out music all night, 
giving it everything they had. So it was really no surprise that Utena 
wasn&#39;t the only one sweating under the harsh blinding lights of the 
stage. No one in Crysanthium Ecstasy was able to make out individual 
features in the cheering throbbing mass of bodies before and around 
them, but they could feel the energy of the crowd and hear the somewhat 
off-key locals who sang along with them.

Jared struck a sharp resounding cord, and their fans roared in approval. 
His and Utena&#39;s voices blended into the final lines of the song, his 
deeper masculine voice complimenting her slightly higher and smoother 
one nicely.

&quot;Leave me to my swinging...just leave me to my swinging...just leave 
me...just swing!&quot;

At the final slam of the twin sets of drums and the last quick jerk of 
the various strings, the entire group simultaneously collapsed away from 
their instruments. The crowd was in a frenzy. Suddenly the burly guys in 
security shirts had their hands full trying to keep the more zealous 
from climbing up the bars to reach the raised stage. The pink haired 
woman swiped her hand across her forehead, her pink curls damp around 
her ears. Declarations from members of the crowd barely reached her ears 
as she picked up the mike from it&#39;s stand. The slightly husky sound of 
her voice already had immediate effect and the seething mob calmed. The 
concert hall fell silent as she addressed them with her infamous 
half-cocked smile.

&quot;I can&#39;t thank you all enough for comin&#39; out tonight. You made it 
happen!&quot; Cheers erupted and she waited until they finally quieted again. 
&quot;And for being such a kick-ass crowd-&quot;, she was cut off again by mayhem 
and gave a chuckle that electronically rippled across the crowd through 
the massive speakers situated around them. &quot;-we&#39;re going to play one 
last song for you before we end this.&quot; The noise that followed made the 
floor tremble. Utena situated the mic back in its stand and swung her 
guitar around on its strap. Looking back at the grinning faces behind 
her, she called &quot;You all ready?&quot;

Eric gave a nod with a thumbs up and the others acknowledged. Mason 
called back jokingly, &quot;Think you can stay standing long enough for this 
last bit?&quot; Jared laughed away from the mike, even as Mason began 
clicking his drum sticks together over his head, &quot;She&#39;d better...I&#39;d 
hate to see what they&#39;d do to her if she didn&#39;t...&quot;

Utena casually flipped them off and turned back around counting in her 
head. Once Eric had played the first four measures, she and Jared 
exploded into the microphones...

Later, the band walked behind stage. Some moved with limps from having 
leaped, stomped, and crashed about during the last show. All were 
sporting a more costly wardrobe than when they had first signed their 
contracts months ago, although most had stuck with their tastes. As one 
they headed for the lounge that had been prepared for them, knowing 
their instruments would be well taken care of by the staff.

Eric held Mason&#39;s hand loosely, and little Violet was being cuddled by 
Jared (who had easily picked up the smaller gothic girl). She gave a 
rare happy smile as the brotherly gesture swung her to and fro. The 
corner of the lead singer&#39;s lips tugged into a soft smile at the sight. 
She ran a hair through her soggy pink curls tiredly. She squeezed her 
eyes shut as a pain flashed through her brain like fire. Her head was 
buzzing...had been buzzing a lot lately... She ignored it.

As they entered the lounge, where they had been scheduled to meet with 
those who had backstage passes, camera bulbs flashed to life and left 
spots in the pink haired woman&#39;s eyes. She kept her smirk plastered on 
her face due to increasing practice. As the flashes slowed and her eyes 
adjusted to the room, she could make out the shapes of six various young 
people. All who seemed about to burst in their excitement. Utena 
chuckled inward darkly. She still couldn&#39;t fathom why their fans could 
be so obsessed with them. To her, they were still the same measly band 
playing at shifty bars. But to their fans they were idols.

Lance and Mason were flashing their million watt smiles as two punk 
dressed girls clamored over to them with hearts practically in their 
eyes. Jared had slung an arm around one scrawny beaming kid and was 
taking a picture. Eric was in the middle of chatting with a guy who was 
obviously trying to pick her up. And Violet was shyly standing to the 
side, having received a cola from a gentlemanly fellow. She was handed 
an autograph book, which she obliged by signing with her ornate 
signature.

Tenjou was so caught up with watching the others that she was suddenly 
surprised when the kid Jared had been with, along the two girls, 
suddenly rounded on her.

&quot;Oh wow, it&#39;s such an honor to meet you!&quot;

&quot;Ten, I absolutely love your voice! I have all you guys&#39; cds!&quot;

&quot;Can I get a picture and an autograph?&quot;

&quot;Omigosh you&#39;re even hotter in real life!&quot;

&quot;Wow, is that a new tattoo?! It&#39;s awesome!&quot;

Utena tried to keep from stepping back nervously as she gave a small nod 
and a murmured word of thanks. A handmade tablet was shoved eagerly into 
her hands. No sooner had she finished signing that one that she found 
herself the object of a double embrace between the two girls. A sudden 
flash blinded her world. Two more came over for autographs and then she 
was in the midst of a group shot with her fellow band members. Her head 
buzzed harder, and her eyes narrowed in discomfort. Her tense body 
started as she felt a large warm hand on her shoulder. But she quickly 
relaxed as she recognized it as Jared&#39;s. With him there as an anchor, 
she managed to steady her reeling mind. Once the picture was taken, she 
walked away towards the refreshment table, a headache beginning to stab 
between her eyes.

&quot;Would you like a towel?&quot;

The blue eyed singer was leaning tiredly on the table&#39;s edge, her brow 
still slick with sweat from the concert. Without looking over her 
shoulder she gratefully accepted a small white hand towel. Mopping her 
brow and turning around she gave a plastered-on smile.

&quot;Thanks, I really-&quot;, her words died in her throat. Before her stood a 
dark skinned beauty with long trailing violet hair. She was dressed in a 
business woman&#39;s silk blouse top and slacks, gracefully poised on high 
heels. Her good looks were enough to hit anyone like a truck, but it was 
the dark cold chill that ran down her spine that stopped Utena cold. 
With that chill came a dark anger that broiled deeply, somewhere in her 
stomach. Her jaw clenched.

Jared came up beside her and gave her a discreet nudge. Giving herself a 
mental shake, Utena forced a smile back on her face and continued, &quot;I 
really appreciate it.&quot; She was certain the sudden awkwardness had to be 
plain to everyone in the room. &#39;The hell was wrong with her? Pull it 
together!&#39; was the look that came from Lance.

The dark woman smiled, &quot;Hello Utena.&quot; Jared immediately looked up and 
gave a suspicious frown as he turned to his friend. Utena&#39;s fake smile 
had faded into what appeared to him to be cold confusion.

&quot;I go by the name &#39;Ten&#39;. &#39;Utena&#39; is not a name I use.&quot;

The woman&#39;s warm smile never wavered, &quot;But your name was Utena Tenjou 
once...don&#39;t you recall?&quot;

Utena began to frown as well. &quot;Sorry...it&#39;s just &#39;Ten&#39;...now who might 
you be?&quot;

The woman gave a bow and switched to Japanese, which only the pink 
haired girl was able to understand. &quot;I am Himemiya, Anthy. And I&#39;ve 
known you since before you became &#39;Ten&#39;. But it seems as though you 
haven&#39;t remembered yet.&quot;

Utena&#39;s smile returned, but her eyes had gone as cold as winter skies. 
She replied in Japanese as well, astounding Jared who looked completely 
lost with the exchange. &quot;Nope, you must be mistaken. Or you&#39;re just 
another one of these idiots who write and email us about being old 
friends and acquaintances. I don&#39;t know you.&quot;

That feeling that hadtingled down her back and across her skin remained, 
strengthened, but she doggedly refused to let it show. Something else 
was coming to the forefront of her senses: The scent of roses was 
perfuming the air. It was a scent Utena despised more than anything 
else. The woman allowed a glimpse of frustration and impatience to mar 
her features, but then the smile was back in place quick enough. The 
so-called Anthy Himemiya bowed and presented her a vase of a dozen white 
roses along with a business card.

&quot;Well then, will you not at least accept this then, Ms. Ten?&quot;

Utena warily took the vase and card, reading it quickly. It stated 
boldly: Anthy Himemiya- West Shore Catering and Floral Services. The 
woman opposite her smiled, and it lit up her face like that of a divine 
goddess. Utena suddenly felt the urge to take the vase and smash into 
that pretty little head. But Jared on the other hand was blushing 
slightly, and looked like he had been hit between the eyes by a sledge 
hammer.

&quot;Perhaps we&#39;ll be in touch, who knows...maybe you&#39;ll have need of my 
services someday...even if it&#39;s just to talk.&quot; Anthy switched back to 
English with this last statement and Jared grinned at Utena lecherously. 
The woman in question however merely shook her head, her voice coming 
out strangely through her clenched teeth. &quot;I highly doubt that.&quot; And 
with that said, she spun on her booted heel and headed for the door. 
There were noises of disappointment behind her, but her new manager and 
a couple of security guards stepped in to begin ushering people out.

Back in her dressing room, Utena glared at the vase of flowers in her 
hands. She moved to toss them in the trash bin, but stopped and placed 
them on Violet&#39;s table instead. The girl would appreciate them more 
anyway. She did however tear the business card in two and threw the 
pieces away as she took a seat in her chair. A moment later, her 
chattering band mates came in, situating themselves about the room.

Jared came in last, making cow eyes at her reflection in the mirror. 
&#39;Ten&#39; groaned, already knowing what was to come.

&quot;Woo woo! Wow Ten, a total lady killer, eh? So is that the way you swing 
then? She sure was hot enough.&quot;

Eric raised an eyebrow in mild surprise, &quot;What chick was this?&quot; Jared 
grinned mischievously, &quot;The knock-out indian broad. The only one who 
didn&#39;t look like a total groupie.&quot;

Mason gave a burst of laughter, &quot;Woah ho! Some girl checkin&#39; you out, 
huh?&quot; Utena gave a huff of annoyance and crossed her arms.

&quot;Can it already.&quot;

But Mason only grinned wider, &quot;And here I thought you were a man-eater.&quot; 
He made a lewd geature with his face and hands as Eric shoved him off 
the chair he was sitting, &quot;That&#39;s so gross you pig.&quot;

Utena smirked at the two men and batted her eyes, growing quite tired of 
being the butt of their jokes, &quot;Well now, I&#39;d like to consider myself an 
&#39;equal opportunist&#39;...&quot; She made a kissing motion at Jared, &quot;...Just not 
with either of you.&quot;

Jared gave a mock cry of pain, &quot;Ouch chickie, that hurt! Careful with 
that acid tongue of yours, you&#39;ll bring a man on his knees.&quot; Then he 
grinned devilishly, &quot;Which may not be so bad.&quot; The others groaned at 
this lame comeback, except for Violet who was blushing. His gaze became 
serious however as he locked eyes with her reflection&#39;s, since her back 
was turned to the group. &quot;But still...it&#39;s weird how she knew your real 
name...nobody should, &#39;cause we never use it for anything...you know her 
or somethin&#39;? Sounded like she spoke chinese or whatever it is you 
speak...&quot;

&quot;Japanese...&quot; Utena remarked absently, her face one full of brooding. 
She frowned and shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know her.&quot;

The room was quiet a moment, until Lance broke it abruptly, &quot;Could she 
have, ya know...known you from before?&quot; The room became tense as Utena 
said nothing. Eric unable to stand it anymore leaned over and punched 
him hard in the arm, &quot; Ass! Don&#39;t bring that up. It doesn&#39;t matter she&#39;s 
got damn amnesia-&quot; she broke off her statement, looking embarrassed. 
&quot;S-sorry...&quot;

Lance shrugged, &quot;What? I was just sayin&#39;...I mean like, maybe she could 
help or something. Get you into contact with some people. I dunno.&quot; 
Utena stood and gave an amiable shrug. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. No worries... 
I don&#39;t care about the past anymore. &#39;The future is now&#39;, right?&quot; She 
picked up a pack of cigarettes and gave a small wave. &quot;I&#39;m going out 
back for a smoke. I&#39;ll catch up with you guys back at the hotel later.&quot;

The gang gave a nod, and Violet went to collect her roses, &quot;Is it okay? 
I can have these?&quot;

The pale woman gave a smile and tossled her hair, &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m allergic to 
roses.&quot;

After closing the door behind her, she gave a nod to one of the security 
guards standing by the back door. He assured her the area was cleared of 
people. She pushed the bar and stepped out into the cool night, leaning 
against the side of the building tiredly. Her form was shadowed from 
view for a moment until a tiny click was heard and a small flare of 
light lit up her chin and cheeks in its glow. The light went out, but 
the glowing end of her cigarette was still visible. Rings of spicy clove 
smoke drifted upwards as she breathed and then exhaled. She closed her 
eyes, just concentrating on the taste of the slender tube in her mouth. 
It would be quite a while before she would show back up at the hotel. 
Her head was buzzing again...
