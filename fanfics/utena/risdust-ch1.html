<h1>The Rising Cloud of Dust</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lectricity.html">The Ghost of 'lectricity</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The air was cool and the trees were swaying in the 
wind. The melodies of the birds conversing were 
filling the empty spaces between the wind and the 
trees. Under her bare feet the soil felt refreshing 
and she sat down beneath a big old oak tree. There 
was a tinge of salt to be felt in the air and from 
somewhere very far away the sound of waves crashing 
against the cliffs at the horizon was heard.

In the distance dust was rising from the path leading 
up to the hill which wasn&#39;t exactly a hill but just a 
piece of raised land. With each breath, with each 
closing step memories were coming back to her. 
Memories of a big tree under which lunches had been 
shared, memories of a small room with a two story 
bed, memories of roses, of balconies, of classrooms, 
a rose garden and fights. There had been a lot of 
fights but she had never felt weary of protecting her 
princess. Her bride.

The dust cloud was getting nearer and nearer, 
somebody was aproaching her under the lazy seaside 
sun which was dragging itself across the sky. A smile 
formed on her lips as she remembered their clumsy 
stumbling to each other. Their feelings had become 
persistent. They were like two magnets which couldn&#39;t 
decide which pole to be. They were attracting each 
other and in the next moment they inadvertedly 
rejected each other.

It was almost at the tree, the cloud of dust. The 
cloud that rose into a cloudless sky, ruled by the 
fire of creation. Fire always attracts lots of 
people; some want to put it out, some want to enrage 
it into an inferno, some want to hold tree branches 
into it, watching it devour them. There had been a 
fire of emotions between them - or maybe it was just 
a lump of  red-hot charcoal that waited to be put 
into dry firewood. Sometimes she couldn&#39;t tell.

Her smile had become wide, but the old man on the 
shaky rack wagon couldn&#39;t understand. He thought the 
young lady, which wasn&#39;t dressed very ladylike at 
all, was just expecting someone else but he couldn&#39;t 
have known that even after he would pass her, the 
woman will still be smiling. Because she knew. 
Something inside her was burning now and she knew 
that the one she was waiting for would come. She felt 
it, she felt the fire, the warmth and she was willing 
to wait till eternity comes around just to see her 
once again. She knew that her princess, the one she 
tried so hard to protect and make her bloom will come 
down from her throne of thorns. She knew that Anthy 
was coming.

Notes:
I&#39;m not expecting people to actually like it, or 
anything like that... It&#39;s just that I had something 
in myself that I wanted to express in this way. Utena 
is one of my favourite Animes and I just wanted to - 
y&#39;know - add my share. Plus I just watched a nice 
movie and I kinda fell in the mood.  Anyways, drop me 
a line, I&#39;d be happy about it (and I&#39;ll reply too, 
but it could take a while).
