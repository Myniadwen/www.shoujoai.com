&quot;Alright, you&#39;re all the group Chrysanthemum Ecstasy? Please follow 
me...a representative will be with you shortly.&quot; There was a blazing 
good-natured smile, a bow of respect, and a cheerful arm sweep as the 
woman ushered the quiet group of young people into a posh lounge 
setting. If her cheerfulness was grating on any of the solemn people&#39;s 
nerves, it didn&#39;t show. No one else spoke a word, so Utena gave her a 
warm smile, &quot;Thank you very much for your assistance.&quot;

Within moments they were greeted by a host of interviewers and people 
from the magazine, and ushered into private rooms to speak their piece 
before they were photographed. With varying degrees of enthusiasm and 
charisma. An hour or so passed, lunch was served graciously, and the 
group reformed at the site of the shoot. Deep in the bowels of the sleek 
company building, Juri Arisugawa waited, her blouse sleeves pushed up 
and her camera around her neck.

Despite her somewhat casual business attire, and her curled mane 
sweeping loose down her back and shoulders, she looked every inch the 
professional. When introductions were out of the way, a lot of bowing 
and scraping from the Japanese managers, Juri set to work setting the 
stage. With a subtle glance, her eyes narrowed at a see-through panel in 
the wall to the side. It was there Touga and Anthy waited, to see what 
they could covertly learn. Where they waited for Juri&#39;s verdict.

Juri&#39;s full attention returned to the group. They were short one. That 
girl...the younger one who played the keyboard...it would seem she 
hadn&#39;t yet arrived from her session with Miki. Juri had been surprised 
somewhat to learn this. She hadn&#39;t known Miki was playing a duet with 
one of these...these punk-rockers...Then again, it had been some time 
since they had spoken...a week and a half to be precise...she would have 
to invite the Kaoru siblings to dinner sometime. Shiori would be glad to 
see them again she was sure. That brought a slight smile to her lips.

She would play it by ear for now, and take the individual shots, leaving 
the group ones until the girl arrived. Miki was quite punctual after 
all. The owner of Cultivated Elegance finished placing one of the young 
gentlemen on the stool, and set to snapping photos while arranging his 
body...he had a mohawk of all things! Shaking off her distaste, she 
posed him and continued on. Best to save Tenjou till last.

Of course...with her skills...that didn&#39;t seem to last nearly long 
enough. The orange curled woman had been careful...oh so careful not to 
glance too much in her direction. Not to look up and gaze at the thing 
that had given even Kiryuu himself pause. Hadn&#39;t wanted to see the utter 
transformation. But when she finally came over to grasp a hold of that 
perfect pale skin...she halted.

My god but things had changed...the piercings...the short cropped 
hair...the leather and black...and was that a tattoo? Where was that 
cheerful and naive girl who had shone with a purity and grace? Those 
eyes...soulless and dead...it was chilling. But even as she gazed 
thoughtfully on that curve in the jaw, and that slender build...she 
still couldn&#39;t get past how damn striking she was. Despite the drastic 
change in wardrobe and apparently music taste...nothing could hide that 
dignified air that was all Tenjou. It really was her...

Memories of moonlit chats and fountains flooded her mind. And with 
difficulty she kept her features smooth. This wasn&#39;t Tenjou...not at the 
moment anyway. She shook her concentration back to the task, and was 
about to open her mouth to get the pink haired woman to stand under the 
lights and against the backdrop, when it hit her. A slithering chill 
that creeped up her spine. Her senses were suddenly on high alert, her 
hackles raised. The panther was once more on the prowl as Arisugawa 
mentally sniffed the air. Something was off here...

She stepped back, so as to take the group of band members completely in 
her view. The managers had left at some point. She stared at the 
silently waiting men and women, Utena looking at her curiously with an 
uncertain smirk on her lips. &quot;Something wrong?&quot;


Yes...her mind said...yes, what&#39;s wrong is YOU...but something else, 
more so...

She couldn&#39;t put her finger on it, but something wasn&#39;t right with this 
picture. She wanted to shrug it off and get back to what she was 
doing...and that feeling disturbed her all the more. She wanted to 
ignore it...badly...and that was not something Juri did. Something was 
afoot here.

But she was startled out of an answer when the door behind her suddenly 
banged open. Like a hurricane, a brown haired form suddenly swooped in 
and ran across the space separating them all. Shocked, Juri distantly 
registered Saionji hurriedly chasing after the woman.

Wait...was that....Wakaba Shinohara? Seems she had finally decided to 
trade in that ridiculous bouncy ponytail and was now wearing a very 
clean cut shoulder-length style. What on earth...how did she clear 
security? Kyouichi looked flustered and worried.

The girl shoved a couple of bodies out of her way and all but tackled 
the shocked pink haired woman. &quot;Utena-sama!! Utena!! How could you?!&quot;

The woman looked utterly baffled, &quot;What are you--&quot;

The brown haired girl was sobbing, hitting her tiny fists against the 
taller woman. &quot;You know what! You made us forget! You made us all 
forget! Everything from back then! From Ohtori! W-why?! You were my best 
and only friend...and I didn&#39;t even remember your face!&quot;

Utena Tenjou for her part had gotten a funny look on her face. Juri was 
still feeling it...that tension in the air...the feeling of wrongness. 
She moved slightly to get into a better position.

&quot;The dreams!! I-I started having them...right after I heard your songs! 
When they came on the radio...and on t.v....and then I remembered 
everything!&quot; She clung to the taller woman like a drowning man. The pink 
haired woman stood immobile and blank. From another side door, Anthy and 
Touga rushed to join the stricken Saionji. Juri wanted to slap her 
forehead in disbelief. Looked as though the gloves were being taken off 
early.

&quot;Saionji, what is going--&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know! I had came home and she was crying and murmuring to 
herself about dreams....about black roses and castles and elevators...I 
tried to calm her down but--&quot;

Utena&#39;s expression took on a look that could have frozen water. &quot;Well 
well...if it isn&#39;t the trouble makers...looking to play more games are 
we?&quot; Juri was taken aback by the hatred in that face. It twisted a 
beautiful angelic facade into something dark and evil. It wasn&#39;t 
natural...Juri&#39;s shoulders tensed for battle...

Anthy looked over, pleadingly at her once Champion and closest friend. 
&quot;Please! Utena! Why won&#39;t you remember?! Why won&#39;t you remember your 
promise...we promised to drink tea together again in ten years! I&#39;ve 
been looking all over and--&quot;

&quot;...eight...&quot;

&quot;--no matter what I did I....w...what did you just say?&quot;

The most cruel and seductive smile Juri had ever seen outside the 
Chairman suddenly spread across Tenjou&#39;s lips. It chilled every 
duelist&#39;s bones when they saw it. Wakaba had stopped crying and took 
several steps back. The leather bedecked woman began slowly pacing 
forward, her movements graceful and swirling with an alien energy.

&quot;I said...eight...it hasn&#39;t been ten years yet...it&#39;s only been eight. A 
bit early for our &#39;appointment&#39;, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

Anthy was floored, her violet eyes wide with incomprehension. &quot;W-what? 
How did you remember that? Do you...?&quot;

Utena gave a laugh, a gorgeous rippling sound that rubbed like velvet on 
the ears of all in the room. Her band mates stood unmoving, 
expressionless. That throaty voice matched the dancing light of 
amusement in those robin&#39;s egg eyes. &quot;Of course I remember...I remember 
everything.&quot;

It was Touga who broke the dead silence of that answer, &quot;So you mean to 
say...you--&quot;

&quot;Lied? Yes. Obviously.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyebrow arched, and Utena swung her attention onto her. &quot;Oh 
little Arisugawa...do we find that really so hard to believe? You&#39;re not 
a very good actor by the way...I knew you recognized me from the moment 
our eyes met. You&#39;ve softened quite a bit...all of you have.&quot;

Her next words were like acid, &quot;...Pathetic.&quot;

When Utena moved to touch Anthy&#39;s cheek, Saionji strode forward with 
Wakaba safely behind him. Casually Utena lightly backhanded him, sending 
him skidding across the floor. Touga reached into his jacket and pulled 
out a black handgun, aiming it at that coy smile, only to be tackled by 
two of the men standing there like dolls. The pony-tailed girl moved 
over and disarmed him easily. It was over before Juri could react. What 
was going on?!

&quot;What is going on?&quot; Utena asked, seemingly reading the company owner&#39;s 
mind. &quot;Why...a new little game is beginning...that&#39;s what is going on.&quot; 
She grasped Anthy&#39;s cheeks in one hand, catching the swinging fist in 
the other hand. She held the struggling Himemiya as easily as one held a 
child.

&quot;Let her go, Utena!&quot;

Utena snarled like a beast, and snapped her head to glare at Wakaba who 
was crouched over her lover protectively. &quot;MY NAME IS NOT UTENA! UTENA 
IS LONG SINCE DEAD! MY NAME IS TEN!!&quot; Wakaba winced at that stinging 
reply. A harsh cry of pain sounded, and Utena reared back holding her 
hand. Blood dripped down the corner of a dark-skinned mouth. Defiantly 
Anthy glared back at her once savior, a hate and anger and power searing 
in her own eyes.

&quot;No you are not Utena...but I do know what you are!&quot; Utena&#39;s lips curled 
in a dark smile, &quot;You are the Million Swords!!&quot;

Several pairs of eyes were locked on the two women, each with varying 
degrees of emotion. Utena gave that throaty laugh again, and her eyes 
changed to a shining silver. The air seemed to rasp about her.

&quot;Very good little one...ah, but then who would know better than you? We 
did have such fun slicing into that delicate flesh again...and 
again...and again...for so many years...&quot;

Utena rotated her hips and sent a charging Juri down into the tiled 
floor with a grunt. Her smile never wavered. &quot;Ahhh, so we are all in the 
know at last...you understand the implications then, do you Witch?&quot; Ten 
chuckled as Anthy swore under her breath violently, &quot;That&#39;s right...I 
control this Prince&#39;s body...But not just I, but nine of my siblings. 
Well...five now...four of us have found delightful new homes...&quot; The 
formerly human members of Crysanthium Ecstasy lined up on both sides of 
the short haired singer, like a row of generals for a daimyo. Juri 
pushed herself to her feet as she gave a snarl of anger. That&#39;s why they 
seemed off to her. A glance at Himemiya told her the situation was 
bad...very bad...They were about to find out just how bad.

Touga moved to stand alongside the Juri, a bit behind Himemiya. He was 
soon joined by Saionji and his soon-to-be bride. The tension in the air 
crackled electrically.

His smooth calm voice broke the ice again, &quot;So that&#39;s the meaning behind 
the name...it&#39;s not a shortening of Tenjou...it is the number of swords 
in her body. My, how poetic...&quot; He drawled, trying to keep his fear and 
rage out of his voice and face. How dare this thing take over the body 
of his Utena! His fellows seemed to carry his sentiments.

Anthy spat out her next words heatedly, &quot;I take it Utena is still inside 
her own mind? You&#39;ve just buried her temporarily?&quot; The red haired man 
felt a flash of hope and triumph. If they could somehow get rid of the 
swords...

The one known as &#39;Ten&#39; scowled, her silver eyes flashing dangerously. 
When she spoke, her words hissed and scraped &quot;Yessss...that false Prince 
is here...but that does not mean she is here.&quot;

&quot;Stop speaking in riddles!&quot;

Sly now, &quot;Oh, but we learned from the very best, Witch. I suppose you 
wish me to go on and on about the details of our stay here, and what our 
grand plans are? You&#39;d like that wouldn&#39;t you...that you could plan and 
strategize how to stop us and save your precious woman. Well...I&#39;m 
feeling generous today, why don&#39;t I indulge you? Ha ha haaaaa...you reek 
of confusion and distrust, Witch. You don&#39;t trust us?&quot;

Himemiya scowled hotly, &quot;Of course not! I know well your lies!&quot;

The swords frowned darkly, eyes unreadable. &quot;Yesss...I suppose you do. 
But I will speak, if only to see the look of pain enter your face.&quot; It&#39;s 
tone was harsh and biting. &quot;The Prince is still deep within her mind, 
but she is not conscious of that which goes on around her. She is in a 
coffin of her own making.&quot;

&quot;Lie.&quot;

&quot;Fine...she is not conscious all the time. She has her moments of 
rebellion, brief as they are. A will of iron in her core...something we 
swords can grudgingly respect. Ah, but we still hate her oh so 
much...that pompous naive fool...she can never be truly forgiven. Not 
after the way she hurt us. We will never let our hatred go...cannot...we 
embody that human trait after all. It is how we were brought into 
existence.&quot; A cold smile, &quot;We were born to hurt you...because the world 
refused to accept your existence after your sin. You imprisoned the 
light...and in doing so opened Pandora&#39;s box of horrors, little Anthy.&quot;

Touga and Juri each simultaneously laid hands on Anthy&#39;s shoulders to 
keep her from taking a step forward. Saionji was holding Wakaba like she 
was going to disappear. A brittle harsh tinkling laughter rose up from 
the punk rockers, all who stood waiting with infinite patience. Juri was 
calculating which one she&#39;d be able to take in order to get to the gun. 
God how she wished she had her foil right now...

Utena took another step forward, &quot;Ahhh...but you still don&#39;t know...and 
don&#39;t truly feel the hopelessness of your situation little ones...Allow 
me to enlighten you all, while time permits. Do you think after she 
unleashed that disgusting power at the final battle...that all important 
duel named Revolution, that she walked away unscathed? Fools...she 
nearly died...our little puppet Akio had done a wonderful job battering 
at her mental defenses...and yet she still drove him back. She fended 
off we swords as well as we swooped in as one!&quot;

The monologue was becoming fragmented, Ten seemed to be lost in it&#39;s own 
train of thought. Passionately with a sick anger, she began chewing off 
her disjointed words. &quot;We were so angry! We hated her! How dare she! She 
ruined everything! She broke the natural order of things! Miserable 
whelp! Naive whore! False Prince! The Rose Bride was OURS to punish for 
all eternity! The Witch was to be punished for locking away the Prince 
of Light, a sinner of the highest order! And that fool stepped in! Freed 
her from us, took her place! We did not want that spindly girl...we 
wanted the true sinner!! And she stood in our way! Broke the connection! 
We HATED her!!!&quot;

Flecks of foam were flying out of that ugly contorted face. The lesser 
swords standing behind her made motions of anger and frustration, 
grabbing their hair and faces in mockery of human characteristics.

&quot;And we would have KILLED her a thousand times over if we could, but 
that bitch shattered us! We were shattered by that filthy 
compassion...that loathsome caring. She thought only of you as she fell, 
Anthy Himemiya! You and these other Ohtori fools...she wanted to protect 
you all from us...so she broke us again and again as we fell. 
Falling...we fell for so long...broken hilts...torn uniform...blood 
raining about...sharp splinters of steel pelting the earth. It 
hurt...ah! Such exquisite pain never felt before! But she was in pain 
too...we managed to cut her to ribbons as we died...she was bleeding and 
broken and forgotten...as it should be! But the Million Swords...our 
brethren...gone! Reduced to a weakened few...about to perish in the 
earth we were born from!&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes widened in shock and pain. The image the sword painted was 
terrible...what had her poor Utena gone through? She must have been in 
such pain...and yet Anthy had looked for her after the battle...searched 
for her victor. Only to find nothing. Just crumpled rusted cars like 
broken teeth sticking out of the rubble...but no swords...and certainly 
no Utena...what then...?

The swords continued their tale. &quot;So we decided to call a cease 
fire...we were soon to die, something that was completely unacceptable! 
The girl was weakened...hurting...wallowing in her own pain and 
self-pity. As she lay bleeding on the rocks, she began to doubt. And in 
that way we were able to whisper in her ears...&quot;

The sword&#39;s voice took on a rasping throaty quality...low, as if in 
confidence. &quot;We spoke to her Anthy...and we made a deal.&quot;

The violet haired woman jerked as if struck by lightning. She seemed to 
struggle to speak, only able to squeeze out a tiny whisper. &quot;N-no...&quot;

That cruel triumphant smile, &quot;Yes. Tenjou made a deal with us, in return 
for allowing us the use of her body. And we have kept our end of the 
bargain. We made you all forget her existence...allowed you to lead 
normal lives...haven&#39;t hunted you like the animals you are. She was near 
to bursting with her newfound power...but lacked control. We were 
weakened, but had the tempered existence of a millennia. And so we 
joined as one, and she left that shell. She disappeared into the outside 
world.&quot;

The sword blew her a kiss. &quot;Oh she hated you Anthy...as time went on, 
and she retained her memories, she began to hate her own existence. And 
she began to see how you betrayed her. We communed with her...broke 
bread at the same table, and showed her your true nature. The 
manipulative, lying, cruel side of you that we know so well. And as we 
showed her over and over...whispered sweet promises in her ear...the 
wedge in her heart was hammered in a little deeper each day. She began 
to forget what life had been like before us...began to appreciate living 
with us. And now here we are...together...on the brink of a new era.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?! You&#39;re lying, Utena isn&#39;t like that!!&quot;

&quot;Stop opening your mouth, Shinohara, or I will sew it shut. A new era! A 
glorious vision about to come into existence...a new game about to 
begin.&quot;

Anthy took on a contemptuous look, &quot;Enough empty words...hurry up and 
stop wasting my time so I can obliterate you.&quot; The sword gave her a 
smirking smile, and licked its lips. &quot;Oh my...such false bravado...you 
have no power here. You&#39;ll be punished for you impudence in good time, I 
assure you. Ahh...but time is growing short...best to tell you how you 
are going to die. You and these pigs standing beside you...&quot;

Touga frowned at such blatant insults, and Wakaba&#39;s wide forehead 
crinkled in determination, even if she wasn&#39;t exactly sure what on earth 
everyone was talking about.

&quot;The game we are about to play is one with rules of course...my rules. 
The world is our playing board, and you are all my pawns...you and 
everyone who listens to my music.&quot; Ten made a broad gesture as it spoke, 
&quot;Imagine...millions...soon to be billions of people are being captivated 
with our songs...with our words and voice. Like a siren We&#39;ve been 
whispering to them across space and time...coiling about their hearts 
and minds...and implanting the seed.&quot; Ten gave a lewd smile, &quot;Yesss...as 
they listen, it becomes like a drug...they are encouraged to listen 
more...to watch us...think of us...pay homage through sales and 
production...fantasize about our touch and our taste. A true cult in the 
making...fanatics already in existence. We have a following...and it 
grows larger every hour. We are worshiped by these fools...and they will 
soon live to serve us. I have to admit...Utena having met Jared two 
years ago was the greatest thing that could have happened. A change in 
luck...and the beginnings of our plans.&quot;

Ten paced away, and her sword generals fanned out to surround the group 
of ex-duelists.

&quot;And when they&#39;ve reached the peak...obtained a certain amount of desire 
and loyalty to us...then the change begins. Then...a new sword is born.&quot; 
Anthy&#39;s eyes widened as truth clicked into place.

&quot;You&#39;re breeding swords...you&#39;re resurrecting the Million Swords...out 
of innocent people!!&quot;

&quot;Ha ha ha...innocent? Hardly...Not when I&#39;m done with them...Simply 
think of it! The Million swords will be reborn...only it will be the 6.4 
Billion Swords...&quot;

Saionji and Touga gasped in understanding. Juri had heard enough. 
Suddenly darting toward one of the larger men, she twisted out of the 
way of his counterattack and hooked her leg around his own. With a sharp 
roundhouse to the head she dropped him and darted for the girl with the 
gun. Touga and Saionji took on two other charging Sword Generals (as 
they had started thinking of them) while Juri gave a right hook at the 
girl. Before she could raise the gun, Juri managed to twist it out of 
her hand, and point it at Ten. The short haired woman watched with 
amusement as Juri squeezed the trigger.

An eternity in a moment. As if looking through a crystal filter, Juri 
watched the bullet slowly leave the recoiling barrel, and fly faster and 
faster at Ten. And then...stop. The piece of lead hung suspended in the 
air, in front of the creature&#39;s heart, and then dropped harmlessly to 
the ground. Ten never lost her smile.

&quot;It seems Tenjou isn&#39;t the only one to lack control. I think I will have 
to deal with you now.&quot; Juri felt an invisible blade slice out of thin 
air through her side. A gasping cry, a splatter of blood on the carpet, 
and she was down. Wakaba was over in an instant, trying to stop the 
bleeding of the very nasty slice. It ran from navel to back.

&quot;T-ten...what are you doing?! W-what&#39;s going on here?!&quot; A soft spoken 
voice cried out tearfully from the doorway. Everyone looked to see Miki 
and a gothic girl standing there stricken and baffled. Ten got a strange 
look on her face, her eye twitching oddly. The silver in her eyes seemed 
to flicker, and blue eyes shone for a moment. Then they were silver once 
more as she put her forehead in her hand. She winced in pain, as if she 
was suffering from a bad migraine. Touga couldn&#39;t be 
certain...but...Ten&#39;s hair looked....longer now...

&quot;V-violet...a bit late for the photo shoot aren&#39;t we?&quot;

Violet seemed scared and confused. Touga wondered how much she had seen. 
&quot;W-we got delayed...and Mr. Kaoru bought me lunch...&quot; Ten seemed to be 
making some sort of internal dance. &quot;Well then, Violet. We were just 
discussing how we&#39;re going to postpone the photo shoot. Some issues came 
up. Shall we leave?&quot;

Ten swept out of the room, with her puppets in tow. Violet cringed and 
followed meekly. Miki looked as though he were about to say something, 
but a deadly look from Ten silenced him effectively. Opening the door 
for her group, and waiting till the last one had left, Utena gave a slow 
creeping smile, her hair brushing past her ears now. &quot;I do so hope you 
all can come to our big concert tomorrow night. It will mark the debut 
of a special cd we will be releasing...and our partnership with the 
platinum metal group, Steel Razors. I&#39;m sure you will find it very 
entertaining...as will all of our very loyal fans...&quot;

She blew one last kiss at the fearfully smoldering Anthy, and went out 
the door.
