--------------------------------------------------

 Anthy stepped off the train and blinked at the midday 
sun. It wasn&#39;t hot since it was the start of spring. She 
inhaled the fresh air and looked around the station. There 
was a run down hotel right next to the tracks. Those were 
the cheapest ones, the ones where the freaks hung out - 
the ones Utena chose.

 The blue-haired traveler sat down on the bench in front 
of the hotel. The suitcase next to her, she sat there and 
kept looking at the hotel. She didn&#39;t like talking to 
people. In fact she didn&#39;t like people much. That was what 
drove her on for a long time. People hated her, so she had 
the right to hate them back. That was what had been giving 
her strength. Everyone was wearing masks and to Anthy all 
the masks looked the same. She was bad at judging people 
so she hid herself behind the pretense that nobody ever 
liked her. That everyone was full of hate for the witch 
that stole away the prince. So she returned the hate 
tenfold.

 She was in luck. The clerk recognized Utena from the 
picture, said she left about a week ago, even told her 
where she went. But Anthy was too tired to get back on a 
train again. Maybe it would take her to the wrong 
direction again anyway. She rented a room and went to 
sleep since she couldn&#39;t sleep on the train.

 She felt good now. She felt like she had a direction. 
Something she could channel her more delicate feelings 
into. Even though she was on the road for a few months now 
she felt she was getting closer to Utena. She understood 
why Utena had to go, why she had to leave immediately. She 
understood herself. She understood why she kept following 
Utena. She understood that when both are going to be ready 
she&#39;ll reach her.
