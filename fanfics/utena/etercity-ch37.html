<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 37 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/etercity-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><pre>Ran Mizuno yawned, the blue haired woman stretching
out on her bed before getting up reluctantly. Sunlight
shone in through the window even though it was
bitterly cold outside, the cloudy winter months having
eased a moment to let glorious sunlight in. Padding
across the floor in just her panties Ran headed for
the dresser, the arthletic form mostly healed from her
injuries. She&#39;d still bear a few vivid scars, but she
moved with ease and comfort as she pulled out pants,
shirt and bra.

&quot;Wonder what&#39;s on the schedule for today?&quot; Ran
murmured as she dressed, a wry smile on her lovely
face.

Since Ran&#39;s permanent return to Earth she had formally
re-applied for her citizenship and had been granted it
by Serenity herself. Then she had contacted her old
friend Priss, who had eagerly helped make the
arrangements for Ran to rejoin the army of Crystal
Tokyo, signing on as both a mecha and fighter pilot.

&quot;If you sleep in much longer,&quot; Erica Tenoh called
after banging on the door, &quot;you&#39;re going to miss
breakfast!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming, hold on,&quot; Ran called back, finishing
buttoning her shirt as she hurried over to the door.

Since coming back home to Earth for the second time
Ran had moved back into the Crystal Palace, though
pointedly not near to her parent suite. She
understood, now, more about why they had been absent
during much of her childhood, but Ran still found it
hard to let go of the resentment that she had held on
to for so long. Still, they were talking now and that
was a major step forward.

&quot;Looks like something happened with Makoto and Taiki,&quot;
Erica revealed as the black haired girl lead her down
the hall, &quot;seems Taiki stayed overnight.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Ran smiled in delighted surprise, &quot;it&#39;s about
time.&quot;

&quot;I thought so too,&quot; Erica laughed as the entered the
elevator, the light surrounding them as they were
whisked downstairs.

&quot;So did Taiki actually decide to stay for breakfast?&quot;
Ran asked her as they got off a few moments later.

&quot;No,&quot; Erica shook her head, &quot;I think neither one of
them wanted to deal with all the teasing they&#39;d get.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t blame them for that,&quot; Ran chuckled.

Up the hall they could hear a slightly off-key Minako
singing teasingly, &quot;Makoto&#39;s got a girlfriend, a
girlfriend....&quot;

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; Erica laughed.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Queen Serenity called from around a
mouth full of food, the white-blonde monarch in a
dressing gown and eating eagerly.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Ran nodded respectfully to her queen as her
eyes swept the large, informal dining hall where they
usually ate.

A blushing Makoto Kino was carrying in plates from the
kitchen, the brown haired amazon smiling faintly.
Minako Aino smirked, the lovely blonde dressed in a
bodysuit of some exotic design. Kind Endymion was
munching toast beside his wife, the purple-black
haired man&#39;s eyes amused as he watched his friends.

&quot;Ran, slept in again?&quot; her mother Ami Mizuno asked,
her blue hair falling forward in front of her old
fashioned glasses. Beside her Rei Hino sat, Ran&#39;s
other mother with the raven black hair and a temper
Ran inherited, too.

&quot;I don&#39;t have to be up,&quot; Ran smiled as she reached the
table and after a moment&#39;s hesitation sat down across
from them, &quot;unlike some people.&quot;

&quot;Thank god for winter break,&quot; Erica sighed, &quot;no
school.&quot; She bent down to kiss her mothers&#39; cheeks,
&quot;Morning.&quot;

&quot;Hello, sleepy head,&quot; Michiru smiled, the green haired
woman&#39;s eyes twinkling.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Haruka nodded, her sandy blonde hair falling
into her eyes. Of the two women it was Haruka whom
Erica most physically resembled, but her calm manner
owed much to her mother Michiru.

&quot;Is Setsuna around?&quot; Erica asked curiously.

&quot;Sleeping in,&quot; Michiru said, &quot;Juri and her were up
late at the Locket, apparently.&quot;

&quot;Trouble?&quot; Ran asked, frowning slightly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Haruka said, &quot;just the usual.&quot;

Serenity snickered softly, &quot;I know what that&#39;s like.&quot;

Endymion fought back a smile. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said as
Rei passed a muffin over, &quot;there are great, Makoto.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell Taiki that,&quot; Makoto chuckled as
she sat down, &quot;these are her latest experiment in
cooking.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re making progress in teaching her?&quot; Ami asked
curiously.

&quot;Taiki&#39;s a scholar as well as a singer,&quot; Makoto dug
into her own food, &quot;it doesn&#39;t take many explainations
before she gets it.&quot;

Serenity smiled suddenly, &quot;Remember how much of a
disaster it was when we helped Taiki on that cooking
show, Makoto?&quot;

Makoto smiled, thinking of the mess they made, &quot;That
did end up being fun.&quot;

&quot;And mostly your fault, Meatball-head,&quot; Rei teased.

&quot;Rei!&quot; Serenity pouted.

Ran fought back a grin, wondering how the people of
Earth would react to this terribly domestic scene.
Most people were used to seeing Serenity and the
senshi as semi-immortal guardians, not human beings
with flaws and human traits.

&quot;So,&quot; Amy scooped up some rice as she asked Ran,
&quot;what&#39;s on the schedule today?&quot;

&quot;Priss and I are combat testing a group of trainees,&quot;
Ran grinned, &quot;ten of them in hardsuits vs me and Priss
in weaponless models.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that a bit unfair?&quot; Rei sounded a bit
concerned.

&quot;Yeah, but Priss won&#39;t let me fight them without my
hardsuit,&quot; Ran flashed a cocky grin.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t what I meant,&quot; Rei chuckled.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Ran smiled, &quot;they won&#39;t lay a hand on me.&quot;

&quot;Is that Catrine&#39;s class?&quot; Erica asked with a bit of
concern. Her girlfriend Catrine had signed up for the
introductary course on Hardsuit piloting over winter
break, persuing her interest in entering pilot&#39;s
school out of highschool.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ran admitted, &quot;do you want me to check
and let you know?&quot;

&quot;As long as it doesn&#39;t violate any rules,&quot; Erica
nodded.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ran grinned back at her partner in crime.

&quot;So, where are Hotaru and Usagi?&quot; Erica asked
curiously.

&quot;They left early to go to the ice-festival,&quot; Serenity
smiled fondly. A soft sigh and a pout, &quot;I wish I could
go.&quot;

&quot;You could, but...&quot; Endymion trailed off.

Attending such a event would be a logistical nightmare
for Serenity&#39;s security forces, having to guard her
while she mingled with the crowds and played games.
Just setting up the trip would be hours of work, much
less alerting the military and police.

&quot;There&#39;s always the disguise pens,&quot; Ran offered
casually.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Serenity brightened.

&quot;Ran!&quot; Minako said scoldingly

&quot;Actually, it&#39;s not a bad idea,&quot; Makoto noted.

&quot;You too?&quot; Minako looked surprised.

&quot;I was thinking disguise pens for all of you,&quot; Ran
clarified, &quot;take the trip out there together.&quot; She met
Minako&#39;s eyes unflinchingly, &quot;Or are you telling me
that the group of you can&#39;t protect the Queen without
help?&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s fighting dirty,&quot; Rei met her daughter&#39;s
eyes angrily.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ami put her hand on Rei&#39;s arm, &quot;but she&#39;s got
a point. It would literally take an army to get
through all of us.&quot;

Rei softened a bit as she saw the silent appeal in
Serenity&#39;s eyes, &quot;You could be right.&quot;

Minako still looked unhappy, but she gave in to the
inevitable. &quot;Can I at least tell Major Motoko?&quot; she
asked wryly.

&quot;Why not invite her along?&quot; Haruka winked.

&quot;When do you want to go?&quot; Michiru asked Serenity with
a smile.

&quot;As soon as possible,&quot; Serenity said, eyes nearly
twinkling with excitement.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get the pens,&quot; Minako got up with a laugh,
&quot;and Ran?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ran looked curious.

&quot;No other suggestions till I get back,&quot; Minako
ordered.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Ran threw a mocking salute.</pre>
