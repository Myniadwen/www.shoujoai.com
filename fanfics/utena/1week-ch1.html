<h1>One Week Revised</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<pre>Saturday

The door to the chairman&#39;s luxurious bathroom creaked open
widely, hot steam from a well needed shower slowly puffing
out into the open room. With a towel over her head and a
off-key melody playing on her lips, Tenjou Utena pranced
out into what was her seemingly empty bedroom. Her best
friend and roommate, Himemiya Anthy had left to visit her
brother tonight, leaving Utena to her own devices. The
pink-haired girl, therefore, had taken this opportunity to
indulge in a nice hot shower, not coming about with a
better way to spend her time. Saturday nights could get
awfully lonely she knew, so it was better to keep herself
occupied.
Now clad in her silky pastel pajamas, Utena began drying
her hair furiously with an old, huge towel.  The cloth
became draped about her whole face in such a way that she
couldn&#39;t see what would have been right in front of her.
Or under her feet.
Suddenly, to the would-be prince&#39;s total shock, she was
stepping on an unsuspecting monkey-mouse.
SQUISH!
&quot;CHHHHUUUUUU!&quot;
&quot;Ahh! WHAT-THE?? Chu-chu?!&quot;
She stumbled forward.
Utena gritted her teeth, preparing to fall on her face.
Instead, she slammed into another shocked and unsuspecting
person, making both fall over in a complete and utter
confusion; fortunately, there was a large, unmade bed to
break their fall. Utena, engulfed in embarrassment, whipped
the cursed towel off her face to see who the poor victim of
her clumsiness had been.
Embarrassed cobalt eyes met the startled gaze of one dark-
skinned Rose Bride.
She was laying on top of Anthy.
She smelt...Like roses.
&quot;H-Himemiya?&quot; Utena whispered, turning a familiar shade of
burning crimson.
&quot;Utena-sama?&quot; Anthy squeaked.
With unnatural speed, Utena practically leaped off of the
Rose Bride.
&quot;G-gomen Himemiya! I, er, wasn&#39;t watching where I was
going!&quot; She stammered.
Shock quickly leaving Anthy&#39;s face, her features slowly
replaced into her usual placid expression. She smiled
reassuringly at her engaged one.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Utena-sama. I had just come back
from seeing my onii-sama, and you didn&#39;t even know I was
here. I should apologize to you,&quot; she said, leaning down to
aid the nearly-flattened Chu-chu, &quot; My poor Chu-chu must
have startled you half to death...&quot;
The crimson was slowly starting to recede from the Victor&#39;s
cheeks, remembering the squashed pet/friend of Anthy.
&quot;Well, let&#39;s just forget it ever happened, ne?&quot;
&quot;Hai, Utena-sama.&quot; She replied as they both tried to help
the poor, almost crippled Chu-chu.</pre>
