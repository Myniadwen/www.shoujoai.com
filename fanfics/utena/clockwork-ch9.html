Flames

Sunshine poured in through the window to fall across her face as Utena&#39;s 
eyelids opened. Her lens shifted through their various filters, as they 
always did at start up, then she worked through her memory banks. She 
felt...tired today. Of course she was at optimum efficiency her sensors 
told her. It was a ridiculous notion. The only thing that perhaps 
bothered her was the small injury to her leg from the day before, but 
even that was for the most part repaired. Still...she felt tired... Less 
energetic than she usually felt.

Perhaps if she was honest with herself, what she really felt was 
depressed. The memory of killing those bandits had felt...so good! God, 
slicing them apart had been twistedly fantastic...letting her take out 
her pain and sorrows...ripping them apart for daring to touch her suit. 
It had rained blood. Something she understood. Something so 
natural...but the look on the three women&#39;s faces had haunted her 
dreams. Anthy had looked so...horror-struck. Disgusted. Wakaba had been 
sick on the way back, unable to hold it together. Out of them all, 
Juri&#39;s expression had been unreadable. But still...she could feel them 
recoil in her mind. And the frozen faces of the bandits she felled...

Their ruined bodies shifted in her dreams to become the bodies of enemy 
Armaki soldiers, as she fired her PT345 electro-assault rifle in the 
front lines of war. Canons mounted on the back of huge hulking land 
crawlers firing with their stubby mechanical legs, aircraft screaming 
across the skies. She could hear her commander roaring over the 
comlinks, her hard suit battered by shrapnel as she just kept firing. 
Had to keep the waves from advancing towards the palace. Had to cut down 
the numbers before they reached the Prince and--

She had woken in the middle of the night, irregularly in a cold sweat. 
Her network processes had quickly pumped the correct amount of 
pseudo-chemicals, in order to balance her levels and bring her back to a 
state of acceptable calm.

For the first time since waking up in her new environment, Utena dreamed 
of the past. And it disturbed her.

Moody, the clockwork knight went through the ritual of checking her 
surroundings, her body, her inventory, shoving aside the growing piles 
of offerings and unlit ritual candles that had managed to sneak under 
her door, and climb inside of her suit. Everything was fine. Well...it 
wasn&#39;t but...she had a mission. Had a charge. She couldn&#39;t ever go back 
to her world but...or see him again but...

Pink hair fell forward to hide her face as the cyborg choked back a sob. 
But with the release of relaxatives in her system, she lifted her head 
again. Everything was fine. She would get through this...create a new 
home for herself.

Taking a breath, she opened the door and exited.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;And damn it all Touga, if only you could&#39;ve seen her step out from that 
suit of armor. I know you&#39;re enamored with her already, but what lies 
underneath? It was perfection...I&#39;ve never seen men&#39;s breeches hug hips 
like those before!&quot; Juri remarked with a frustrated sigh, as she 
reclined back on the ornate couch. Touga was currently brushing out his 
hair, tying it this way and that before deciding to try and braid it in 
the mirror. Looking at his companion through the reflection he chuckled.

&quot;My my...then you&#39;re quite the lucky one then. I&#39;m jealous! And you even 
kissed her...I shall have to hurry to catch up before you steal another 
one away.&quot;

Juri looked over at him meaningfully. &quot;Yes you will...because I&#39;m not 
sharing this one. Besides, she doesn&#39;t seem to put up with your nonsense 
from what you&#39;ve told me. Did you say something to offend?&quot;

Touga sighed and put down the brush. He was currently wearing a burgundy 
gentleman&#39;s long vest, embroidered with tiny phoenixes in gold thread. A 
gift from the king. Although resplendent with his own flaming red hair, 
Touga looking disappointed. His mind was elsewhere. &quot;No...she seemed not 
to think highly of me from the first, but that of course may be due to 
her proximity to lady Anthy. Ah, excuse me...Princess Anthy.&quot; He 
politely amended, pressing a hand to his breast modestly. Juri snorted 
from her place, rising to stand and walk behind him.

&quot;Hmph. Princess. Of all of the ridiculous...I&#39;m not quite sure what the 
Guardian hopes to accomplish with bringing peace and prosperity to this 
corrupt heap of earth. Not with choosing to side with one of the lowest 
individuals in it.&quot; She threw up her hands. &quot;Do you know? Even the 
peasants can&#39;t stand to look at her, let alone follow her. Everyone 
murmurs about witches befuddling the mind of the king...her presence is 
a hindrance to negotiations.&quot; Juri shook her head negatively.

Touga nodded. &quot;Mmm yes. You&#39;re quite right. And yet here she is. It&#39;s 
certainly thrown affairs of state to the wind. She&#39;s been working to 
slowly make her way into the eyes of the court more favorably...but it&#39;s 
met with little success. She seems to have some support amongst the 
lesser castle staff, but outside of that no one sees her. His majesty 
has handed over small matters of the kingdom to her, in order to test 
her for more. But if we want this to turn out for the best, she needs 
something to make her shine. To overshadow the...disquieting whispers 
about her nature. His majesty has thought of this as well.&quot;

Juri rolled her eyes. &quot;What we need to do is put her back in her place. 
I don&#39;t like that all of a sudden she&#39;s granted all of this supposed 
prestige and power. Especially when she&#39;s been little more than a filthy 
bed warmer for years.&quot;

Touga turned and glared at her disapprovingly. &quot;Despite that, it is our 
god&#39;s will. You would do well not to speak ill of the King&#39;s sister, 
even if you&#39;re jealous of her proximity to the Guardian.&quot; he turned back 
to the mirror.

Juri&#39;s eyes narrowed coldly at the back of his head. &quot;What the Guardian 
sees in her, I do not know. Perhaps she truly is a witch... However. I 
know my place in court. And I shan&#39;t do anything to jeopardize it. If 
Anthy is to be a princess then so be it...but more oft than not, the 
glimmering ladies in that place are far more cruel than I could ever be. 
We&#39;ll see how well she stands on her own.&quot; Forcing herself to breathe 
more easily and calmly, Juri settled down from her low tirade.

Anthy always managed to get under her skin. Even when they had been 
together briefly, while Anthy was still but a slave girl, there had been 
something unsettling about her. Intoxicating and disturbing. Green cat&#39;s 
eyes that seemed to bore right into you. The enigmatic way she&#39;d cock 
her head at you in thought before she properly bowed her head in 
acceptance. As if puzzling you...piecing you together... Juri shook her 
head to clear her thoughts. Touga was currently lifting pieces of his 
hair this way and that as if deciding to go with pigtails. He frowned as 
he tried flipping it about for another style. Then he sighed and began 
swishing it about in a lazy swirl around his head. Irritated Juri made a 
noise in her throat and ceased her pacing, coming up behind him.

&quot;Oh...sit down already! I&#39;ll braid your hair for you. Honestly, you men 
are so thick-fingered with these things.&quot;

Touga smiled, the atmosphere in the room relaxed again. &quot;Oh? But I 
thought you liked thic--&quot; He made a sharp noise of pain as the hairbrush 
whacked him from behind.

&quot;Don&#39;t be uncouth, or I&#39;ll tie your hair in knots.&quot; Juri glowered as she 
began running the brush through it again. Deftly she began weaving the 
long soft hair into an intricate french braid.

&quot;So the kiss, Juri.&quot; Touga reminded her. &quot;What about the kiss? This is 
important you know, inquiring minds wish to learn the details of this 
very scandalous action! It&#39;s not every day a heathen atheist kisses the 
lips of a god. I&#39;m surprised Dios didn&#39;t strike you down for such 
blasphemy!&quot; He smirked at her, his lips pouting with humor.

Juri paused, her hand caressing the brush&#39;s handle a she remembered. 
&quot;Ahhh...wonderful my dear sir. So quick and stolen, but I&#39;ve never 
tasted lips so soft before! And her expression was simply adorable.&quot; 
Juri sighed wistfully, closing her eyes in fond memory.

Touga covered his mouth with a hand, managing to keep his tone level 
despite the amusement tugging at his lips. &quot;Forgive me my dear...but you 
sound like a a young page boy who&#39;s mooning over the new kitchen girl. I 
can&#39;t say as though I can picture that lovely sword goddess as 
&#39;adorable&#39; in the slightest. Beautiful...graceful...magnificently 
deadly...but adorable? Surely you jest.&quot; Touga teased. But Juri&#39;s 
expression became unreadable again.

&quot;Yes...she certainly is deadly.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. So what happened afterward? Was the kiss received well?&quot;

Juri was nearly finished with her braiding, reaching the ends of his 
hair. She gave a frustrated snort. &quot;Nothing in the slightest. I&#39;d hoped 
she&#39;d follow me back to my apartments for some...armor inspection we&#39;ll 
say. Or at least to come patrolling down my corridor sometime in the 
night. But sadly I was left alone to mourn the loss of her company.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m sure you found other company to relieve you of your, ah, stress 
we&#39;ll say.&quot; Touga mocked, using her tone from earlier.

&quot;Naturally. I&#39;ll not suffer the indignity of getting stood up twice in 
one day. But it&#39;s vexing not to hold onto the one you truly want. Make 
no mistake, when an Arisugawan sets her eyes on a potential mate she 
doesn&#39;t give up. I&#39;ll woo the Lady Utena given time...perhaps let her 
see the light as it were, about her Princess.&quot;

Touga adjusted a ring on his finger. &quot;Just remember you&#39;ll be having 
competition...it&#39;s a noble&#39;s duty to insure that the Guardian is 
comfortably taken care of in all things.&quot; He blew Juri a kiss in the 
mirror. And winced as she lightly jerked on his braid, bring his head 
back to look at her. She raised an eyebrow before handing him the end of 
his neatly plaited hair.

&quot;There. Tie a ribbon on it and let&#39;s go. I&#39;d hate to miss breakfast 
again because you can&#39;t stop primping, Touga.&quot;

&quot;Oh poo. You&#39;re such a man, Juri.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Utena was uncharacteristically heading to the main hall for breakfast, 
instead of eating alone in Anthy&#39;s room. She didn&#39;t need to eat, just 
like she didn&#39;t need to bathe. The desire wasn&#39;t even there anymore ever 
since she had her surgical operations two thousand years ago. But it had 
become a habit, Anthy usually ordering some new dish or delicacies and 
them tasting and trying what the castle had to offer. Together they&#39;d 
discovered Utena&#39;s penchant for seasoned quail eggs, cinnamon baked 
apples, and the fruit salads mixed with those wonderfully alien berries. 
Eating was more of a hobby now, and a delightful one at that. And she 
liked spending time with her Princess...but...

Well, she wasn&#39;t really feeling like herself today. And she was also 
rather embarrassed. It had been poor form on her part yesterday, crying 
like some weak cadet on his first training day. She&#39;d shown a great 
weakness...having to rely on Anthy to comfort her when it certainly 
should have been the other way around. Her old squadron would have been 
shamed. No. She couldn&#39;t quite face Anthy yet...Utena decided as she 
passed by the milling awed servants in the hallways and the slow-walking 
nobles. Nodding here and there to the graceful curtsies and elegant 
bows, the stoic knight pushed open the large wooden doors to the great 
hall.

There was a burst of noise, like walking into a transparent wall, and 
suddenly the voices of hundreds of chatting people broke around her. 
Many heads looked up, excited and nervous and predatory, as the Guardian 
strode into the hall. She paused as a servant eagerly rushed to her 
side.

&quot;Great Holy Guardian! Good morn&#39; to you! Allow me to direct you to a 
humble place that has been reserved for your honorable presence! Our 
cleric has blessed it in the hopes it will be of adequate standards to 
your grace.&quot; Utena, fighting off a small tick at the corner of her eye, 
gave a small nod and allowed herself to be led to an opulent table set 
to the side of the two thrones on the dais. Equal with the king&#39;s own, 
she noticed...but not higher? Hmmm...that seemed to speak of subtle 
politics.

The servant bowed and scraped so much it must have hurt, as Utena took 
her place and waited as a cup of wine was filled for her. Several nobles 
had stood and seemed to hover about the lower steps of the dais, waiting 
for a chance to speak with her. They buzzed amongst themselves, 
whispering and plotting as they adjusted capes and jeweled rings. But 
Utena was in no mood to deal with them, so they were ignored. But as 
several servants made to quickly bring up platters and trenchers of 
meats and cheeses for her inspection, one noble strode up behind them 
and wouldn&#39;t be ignored.

Kneeling respectfully on one knee, the green-haired General Saionji rose 
and gave a nod. &quot;Sir Guardian.&quot;

Utena raised a small eyebrow and gave a small nod in return. &quot;General 
Saionji.&quot;

Saionji moved and took his place on the lower portion of the dais, just 
below the thrones at the carved table set aside for members of the 
King&#39;s High Council. He picked off several types of cheeses and 
vegetables onto his plate, before selecting a glass of almond milk from 
a bowing servant. &quot;It&#39;s uncommon to see you here, Guardian. I&#39;m 
surprised that the Princess has let you off of her leash in order to 
attend.&quot;

There was a sudden silence as the room looked over in shock at what 
Saionji had said. All eyes turned to Utena to see what her response 
would be. Her blue eyes narrowed but didn&#39;t glance at him as she resumed 
cutting up a piece of pork.

&quot;Hmm. I wouldn&#39;t say it is the Princess who hold my reins...but I do 
believe I know who holds yours. Did the King have a good laugh at your 
defeat in the arena? It was pretty comical.&quot;

Several jaws dropped. White-faced, many individuals flicked their gazes 
between the two as if sensing the electric crackle of tension between 
them. Saionji looked up at the gaggle of nobles however and with a sharp 
glare and a wave of his hands, he sent them hustling away to other parts 
of the room. Glancing over his shoulder, and resting his arm along the 
back of his chair, Saionji gave her a cool look.

&quot;He wasn&#39;t pleased. But then, as he put it, who can challenge a god? 
Still...a victory need not come from winning. I&#39;d like to think I wasn&#39;t 
the only one to lose something.&quot;

Utena frowned as her voice lowered several chilly degrees. &quot;That 
helmet...was priceless. And I will see it is replaced, even if I have to 
take it from your hide.&quot; Saionji smirked, rising her ire even more. So 
she changed tactics to wipe away that smirk. &quot;But you looked like such a 
pretty sleeping beauty in the arms of your red-haired friend. So 
delicate and lovely...why...it looked like Lord Kiryuu was taking his 
bride away!&quot;

Saionji snarled low, eyes blazing as they locked onto hers. &quot;It did not! 
I looked like nothing of the sort. Hmph.&quot; He fell quiet and went back to 
stabbing at his plate. Utena, now smirking, went back to her own as 
well. The two ate determinedly trying to ignore one another. But after a 
little while, Saionji turned and looked at her again. &quot;Where is your 
Princess? Shouldn&#39;t you be with her as her divine protector and 
guidance?&quot; There was a sarcastic edge to his tone. The sounds of 
clattering plates and murmuring voices and had begun buzzing around them 
at normal levels once more.

Utena snorted. &quot;The Princess is in her room dressing. I&#39;ll join her 
shortly, not that it&#39;s any concern of yours.&quot; She popped a piece of food 
mouth gruffly. Chewing she regarded him with annoyance. &quot;You don&#39;t seem 
to show proper respect to my station. You would do well to remember to 
whom you speak.&quot;

Saionji looked at her with a snobbish disgust. &quot;Hmph. My people never 
served Dios. We accepted his presence in the world only when we became a 
part of the Ohtori kingdom. It was required. But I don&#39;t hold the 
beliefs myself, nor do I care for the meddling works of gods and 
spirits. Besides...you&#39;re rather crude and blunt for a divine spirit, 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Utena&#39;s fist clenched around her carving knife as she gave a tight, 
cold, smile. &quot;Insolent pig.&quot;

&quot;Pink-haired mongrel.&quot;

&quot;Green-scalped buffoon.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Anthy was dressed and powdered to perfection, or so her maids had 
insisted. Her elegantly-long green dress fit her body like a glove, and 
her hair had been woven into a gold hair ornament to rest upswept in a 
sort of bun at the top of her head. She took a steadying breath as she 
walked down the halls, set on speaking with Utena today. Last night had 
sent her mind reeling with all sorts of thoughts and worries...and her 
feelings were getting worse. Every time she saw the pale knight smile, 
it made her heart soar. Her tears had made her heart ache. But her 
kiss...that soft kiss upon her forehead, as if to an upset child...that 
had made her heart harden. Utena, she was convinced, only saw her as an 
object to protect...someone too weak to do anything on her own and who 
knew nothing of the world. She didn&#39;t see her as a real woman...just the 
princess she had rescued. But that wasn&#39;t what Anthy wanted!

Anthy&#39;s elegant eyebrows came together in a small frown. Several 
servants bowed as she passed and she paused to smile and greet them in 
turn.

No...that wasn&#39;t what she wanted. She wanted Utena to look at her as a 
friend. As more than a friend! Someone she could trust and confide in 
without worry. Of course, the Holy Knight had her own private mission 
and Anthy was simply another pawn in that. That was fine, she was happy 
to do whatever she could to help the woman! But...but couldn&#39;t she at 
least mean a little more? Couldn&#39;t she have a place in Utena&#39;s heart 
that went beyond simple friendship?

Oh...why couldn&#39;t Utena have kissed her on the lips instead? She&#39;d have 
given anything to have those strong hands hold her shoulders and to feel 
those soft dry lips on her own mouth...

Blushing lightly on her cheeks,Anthy&#39;s head came up as she heard voices 
and footsteps approach.

&quot;And so then I asked him...oh. Good morning to you, Princess Anthy.&quot; 
Touga bowed to Anthy, the orange-curled woman with him doing the same. 
But as Juri rose up from her bow, her eyes locked with the Princess and 
daggers flew between them. Touga seemingly oblivious, smiled.

&quot;Are you on your way to the banquet hall? Might we have the honor of 
accompanying you milady?&quot;

Anthy, her face a politely pleasant mask of civility, smiled and nodded. 
&quot;I would be most pleased to walk with two members of the High Council. 
My thanks. Shall we?&quot;

Touga offered his arm, and Juri took a step to the side. Anthy moved in 
between them and together they headed for the hall.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Pile of horse dung.&quot;

&quot;Go stick your face in a dog&#39;s butt.&quot;

Oh that was it, &quot;You&#39;re incredibly juvenile for the General of an army. 
I can&#39;t say that I can see how someone like you could ever be given such 
a rank...the King must have certainly been short-staffed to give power 
to someone like you.&quot; She was beginning to rise from her seat, hands 
planted squarely on the table before her as she leaned forward. Saionji 
had turned completely in his chair, facing her. His hand edge near his 
sword.

&quot;I don&#39;t need anyone to hand me power...everything I&#39;ve gained in this 
life I&#39;ve taken with my own two hands! I wouldn&#39;t expect someone like 
you to understand that since I&#39;m but a mere mortal... Besides, is that 
not the pot calling the kettle black as it were? Hypocritical woman.&quot;

The glared at each other coming close to blows. But after a moment they 
both sat down and collected themselves, Saionji tapping his finger on 
his table and Utena cricking her neck.

&quot;Hmph. Perhaps. I&#39;ll admit you&#39;re skilled with a sword, but I won&#39;t 
pretend to like you.&quot; She snorted.

&quot;Hmph. Exactly.&quot; Came a stubborn reply from the back of Saionji&#39;s head.

The doors to the hall opened and Anthy entered, trailed by Touga and 
Juri. Surprised, Utena looked up. Saionji gave a curt nod as Touga 
joined him after giving a courtly bow to the Guardian before taking his 
seat. As Juri bowed as well, Utena couldn&#39;t seem to help but notice that 
her black blouse&#39;s strings were left untied and trailed enticing inside 
and along her collarbone. Noticing the other woman&#39;s glance, Juri gave a 
small wink before sitting down. Anthy gave a very small curtsy, just 
enough to signify respect but not so much that it didn&#39;t suit her 
station. Something she&#39;d been practicing lately. Utena found herself 
smiling at her, as Anthy took her new place in the center of the High 
Council.

It was the first time they wouldn&#39;t be eating together directly. It 
felt...strange...and also a bit awkward being put on display. But Anthy 
had mentioned the necessity and Utena had agreed. They needed to be seen 
in public more.

&quot;My goodness...the two of you seem quite awake this morning.&quot; Touga 
commented cheerfully. Saionji shot him a look. Utena sighed and resumed 
her meal, not commenting.

Saionji turned to his side and looked upon Anthy fully for the first 
time in days.

&quot;...You seem well this morning Princess.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Thank you milord General.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m...pleased to see it.&quot; Saionji fell silent and picked at his plate.

Juri broke bread for the table and passed a piece to the Princess, who 
accepted it politely before taking a bite. Sitting up here amongst those 
who&#39;d been a source of torment and unhappiness for so long was putting 
her on edge. Everyone acted as though nothing was wrong; as if they&#39;d 
never had any ill will towards one another before this. The acting 
ability of the elite...one always had to watch their public appearance, 
she thought bitterly.

After a time of quiet eating and polite small talk, Saionji stood.

&quot;Thank you for the grace of your company lords and ladies. But I must 
return to my post. Much needs to be done with our knights&#39; training.&quot;

Touga gave a nod of acceptance. &quot;Of course, General. We all depend upon 
your expertise to safeguard our kingdom. Shall we expect you for dinner 
this evening?&quot; The green-haired man gave a solemn nod and moved around 
the table. Bowing to the Princess, he opened his mouth slightly as if to 
say something. But then he closed it and simply turned to bow to Utena. 
Rising, he turned to leave but paused a moment.

&quot;In light of our earlier conversation, Holy Guardian...the training 
grounds would be honored to have you visit again. My men have reported 
that you were quite an inspiration that last time you visited. Perhaps 
we can have a friendly sparring match sometime.&quot;

Utena gave a hard smile that matched Saionji&#39;s own. They sized each 
other up. &quot;Very well. Thank you for the invitation...General.&quot; Saionji 
turned on his heel and left. Touga looked from Saionji&#39;s retreating form 
to glance back at her. His eyes were calculating as he spoke.

&quot;I must admit to being impressed, Guardian. Our lord Saionji isn&#39;t one 
to extend an invitation like that easily...especially not to one he&#39;s 
dueled so recently. You must have surely made an impression on him, 
holiness.&quot; He smiled, a long braid of crimson hair had draped along his 
shoulder blades and across his collarbone, catching the light. Gazing at 
it, Utena smirked ever so slightly. &quot;Hmm...nice braid.&quot;

Turning away from the handsome man, Utena set her fork and plate aside 
to be taken. &quot;As for the General, I believe we&#39;ve come to an 
understanding.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Anthy had been summoned by the King, to the small parlor room that acted 
as his private office. Behind her the Guardian moved like a well oiled 
machine, despite her large bulky armor. They hadn&#39;t spoken during 
breakfast, and had been called suddenly by a page with a letter for the 
princess. But she hadn&#39;t given up on her plan quite yet...

&quot;Ah! Anthy my dear, so wonderful to see you. And the Guardian! This is 
indeed an honor. Please, have a seat the both of you.&quot; King Akio 
inclined his head as he rose to greet them. Beside him his wife Kanae 
bowed slightly as well, looking elegant and refined in a resplendent 
gold and black gown. The crowns perched on their brows were thickly 
encrusted with jewels. Every movement from them seemed measured and done 
with care, from the graceful nod the queen gave to her husband to the 
way Akio gestured with his hands as he spoke. Like the flutter of a 
bird&#39;s wing. Utena found herself a little impressed how different the 
two of them seemed from the members of the High Council...like they were 
from another world of nobility entirely.

Utena wondered how much of it was an act...the thick clothing hid the 
King&#39;s body well, but she could see the subtle strength in his hands as 
he lifted a goblet to drink from.

&quot;Princess Anthy...it has come to my attention with some dismay of a 
recent escapade you and a serving maid were involved with in the border 
lands of this kingdom. Your interest in the shrine was of some concern 
to our people...but with the return of our Guardian to this life, it is 
natural that the Guardian would have an interest in such places.&quot; The 
king gave a bow to Utena in deference, holding his hands palms up in 
supplication.

&quot;But since you are of...noble blood, and my only sister, I must require 
that you not go out on such a dangerous outing again. The bandits found 
there would surely have killed you and your serving maid, had not Dio&#39;s 
Right Hand and the skilled Arisugawan ambassador been there. A servant 
could have surely shown the Guardian the ruins, if that was the focus of 
the trip...it is not a lady of your standing&#39;s place to become involved 
in such things.&quot;

Akio&#39;s voice sounded firm and a touch troubled beneath his regal 
bearing. The concern of a monarch and brother. Utena couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder if perhaps he...was genuinely concerned for Anthy. But if she was 
passed around...treated with such...no. She had to remain firm and 
unbiased. She needed to assess Akio and his entire kingdom as 
descendants of Dio&#39;s bloodline. She had to insure the kingdom&#39;s 
prosperity. Her programing could not be disobeyed in this.

Remaining silent, Utena watched as Anthy bowed her head in shame.

&quot;Forgive me, my King. I was foolish...I did not mean to...sully the 
reputation of you and the Queen. It shall not happen again.&quot;

Kanae gave her a small kind smile. &quot;We are pleased to see you 
understand. With time you shall grow in wisdom, and learn the arts of a 
Lady.&quot;

Akio nodded, seriously. &quot;Yes...and as for your public image and current 
reputation...we have given thought to this as well.&quot; Utena looked up in 
interest, Akio catching her gaze while speaking.

&quot;We wish to display you, dear sister...in a ball to highlight your 
return to your birthright. As per the Guardian&#39;s decree, you right as 
Princess has been invoked...yet most do not see you truly as one. My 
beloved Kanae has proposed this marvelous idea that I think shall work 
in your favor. We shall hold a grand ball in honor of the recent 
negotiations and alliance between the eastern lands and ours. With the 
increased tensions to the north and in trying to keep all of our many 
cultures and people banded together in a solid unity, it would do well 
to have the various dignitaries come together and spend an evening of 
pleasure and enjoyment. A grand affair, with invitations sent across the 
kingdoms to all of our country men. But...&quot;

He paused, gesturing to Anthy fondly as he gave her a smile. &quot;Most of 
all, I wish to present you...to show the world you have support behind 
you and to allow the simpletons to open their eyes to the promise you 
show. This would be a good chance for you, my dear...and perhaps we can 
find a suitor to take your hand.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes widened a touch as she bowed her head and demurred, 
&quot;Ah...if my King wishes it, I would surely...&quot;

But interrupting, Kanae gently admonished her husband. &quot;Come now 
Akio...we need not be rushing our dear Anthy into marriage so soon. She 
is just getting used to her new duties.&quot; Neither seemed to notice as 
Anthy breathed a small sigh of relief. But the silent Utena did.

He smiled tenderly at his wife, bowing his head slightly as he raised a 
hand. &quot;Ah, perhaps...I merely am looking out for her interests. So, Holy 
Knight...does this meet with your approval?&quot; he asked, now turning fully 
to her. They locked eyes a moment, before Akio tilted his forehead down 
respectfully. Utena considered, mind working.

&quot;Hmm...I must say the plan has many merits. The chance to interact and 
observe so many high profile individuals, all in one place, would be 
invaluable. As would assessing their country&#39;s relationships in action, 
besides simply hearing about them. The good publicity would do 
excellently for the Princess&#39; reputation...and I would be there to act 
as a measure of security.&quot; Utena reasoned as Akio gave a nod of 
agreement.

&quot;Yes, Great One. Many have expressed wishes to glimpse you and offer 
their respects since your awakening and descent from the Sacred 
Mountain. News of the blessing that has fallen onto this kingdom has 
reached the ears of many...and the surrounding rulers are anxious to 
have your grace fall upon them as well. Might we, the kingdom of Ohtori, 
humbly ask the representative of our holy god Dios to this ball we 
plan?&quot;

Utena nodded and gave a small elegant bow at the waist, causing a few 
strands of strawberry hair to fall forward. &quot;As a representative of 
Dios, I shall attend.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful! We are most honored. This shall be a ball like no other.&quot; 
Akio clasped his jeweled hands together, and a servant appeared. The 
servant brought fresh fruit and refilled the goblets of the King and 
Queen. We he had departed, Akio motioned that Anthy could now rise from 
her waiting position in the adjacent parlor chair.

&quot;Thank you for your time, Holy Guardian. Princess Anthy. Perhaps you 
would like to take this opportunity to enjoy the gardens...our resident 
mage, Miki Kaoru, had expressed a desire to share lunch with you two, if 
you are of a mind. He is one in whom I place a great trust and respect 
in, as his skills are unparalleled in all of the Ohtori lands.&quot;

Taking the signal to go Anthy and Utena rose, bowed, and departed. Akio 
watched them from over the rim of his goblet as he sipped, his 
expression cool.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Oh! This is terribly exciting, to actually meet the legendary 
warrior...the sacred armor that had been sleeping in the Mountain Shrine 
for centuries! Why, I can barely contain myself when I think about all 
of the wondrous knowledge she must possess! Who&#39;d have thought that that 
armor actually...contained such a fantastic Spirit!&quot; Miki Kaoru gushed 
excitedly as his hands waved about.

He was wearing his light blue robes of office, silver spirals and stars 
shining with the light as he walked on silent sheepskin boots. The black 
cloak embroidered with the red rose of Ohtori and the silver cord tied 
at his waist were eye catching as well. His sister was dressed in a gown 
made to match, her short hair just a touch longer than his own.

&quot;I mean...no one dared approach, you understand...for fear of the 
powerful curse that had been laid onto the cave and it&#39;s occupant. Not 
even our ancestor mages, powerful though they were, could quite figure 
out how it worked..so they sealed it off with their own spells. I&#39;m not 
so ready to believe that this being is a goddess...but that she is a 
powerful spirit of some sort is certainly a given! Did you hear? She 
took on an entire fully armed bandit horde...alone! And she possesses a 
powerful essence that made her rose glow white, in the Duel Ritual! 
Astounding...&quot;

Kozue pretended to roll her eyes in exasperation. He had been like this 
since they had awoken, Kozue safely in her own apartments when he came 
to call. He showed no signs of knowing anything of what had occurred the 
night before. But Kozue&#39;s lips still tingled from a stolen reverent 
kiss...

&quot;Aren&#39;t you excited to meet her? I would have thought...well...you of 
all people would be just as excited...&quot; Kozue broke from her treacherous 
thoughts as she gave him a reassuring smile.

&quot;Of course, Miki. I&#39;m just nervous I suppose...&quot; He nodded at that, in 
false understanding. &quot;What does one say to one such as her? I wouldn&#39;t 
want to offend... And I hope that the Princess accepts our invitation to 
lunch. I have yet to see the two subjects of the castle gossip!&quot;

The two siblings walked side by side down the main corridor of the 
castle, heading for the side portal that lead to the expansive gardens. 
There, some waiting kitchen servants dressed in their livery had a large 
basket and several neat blankets between them. They fell into step 
quietly as the siblings walked ahead leading the way.

&quot;I know what you mean, but try not to worry! I have spoken with the 
Princess a few times before this and found her to be of a very kind 
personage. And I have heard a few whispers that the Guardian is 
understanding and sincere to those who she approves of. We shall simply 
have to stay in their good graces!&quot; Miki chuckled, stretching up his 
arms to embrace the rising sun. The sunshine was warm on his face, the 
air fresh with the breezes of summer. So very different from the dank 
underground in which he lived. He&#39;d almost forgotten what it felt like 
to walk above ground.

Enjoying the colorful scenery of the carefully tended plants and flowers 
beds that wove and intertwined with the private gardens of the castle, 
he allowed Kozue to take over in the choosing of a spot and the setting 
up of their lunch. In the distance, tucked away under it&#39;s special 
archways of old stone, was the rose garden. A garden within a garden, 
where the sacred roses bloomed in all of their majesty. Forbidden to 
even look at, except for the High Council, the King and his court, and 
the single gardener blessed and purified by seven priests, it stood 
alone from the rest of the trees and blossoms. But their subtle scent 
still somehow managed to sneak in on the perfumed air. A cloying scent 
like a distant dream...perhaps a magick all on its own.

Kozue released the servants to stand at a small distance from the spot 
she had chosen, sitting down with her legs and skirts carefully arranged 
on the picnic blanket. After a moment, Miki came to join her, his pale 
complexion seeming just a bit healthier to her careful eyes. Good...he 
needed to get out more. The King always kept him stuck in that stupid 
stuffy dungeon making him new toys and weapons for his wars...Why 
couldn&#39;t he leave that stuff to his team of warlocks and mages he had in 
the Lower Castle? Well...of course she knew. Even if he didn&#39;t. Miki&#39;s 
genius was second to none, and only he could craft both the arcane laws 
of magick and the newly discovered mechanics of iron and wood together. 
To create a new sort of creation, the likes of which were a shadowed 
likeness to the Elders.

The King had need for such talent... And it was Kozue&#39;s job to ensure 
that nothing occurred to disrupt that. Her eyes narrowed slightly as 
Miki suddenly waved and hurried down the hill to greet a certain 
dark-skinned princess and a hulking armored deity. Yes...nothing...

Miki chattered excitedly as he led the pair up the hill to where the 
&#39;modest&#39; picnic lunch awaited. Apparently what the young man had meant 
by &#39;modest&#39;, he had meant &#39;not including the banquet table&#39;. Anthy gazed 
in small wonder at the large array of foods laid out carefully on the 
spacious blanket as Miki&#39;s twin sister rose gracefully to curtsy to 
them. Returning Kozue&#39;s curtsy with a smaller one of her own, Anthy 
greeted the other woman warmly.

&quot;My goodness, this certainly is lovely. Thank you for the invitation to 
join you, Lady Kaoru. Surely you and the Seiron-Lord Kaoru have gone to 
much expense and effort.&quot;

Kozue, whose heart-shaped face was tilted slightly to look up at Anthy 
from a lower angle, smiled graciously. &quot;Oh not at all, Princess. We are 
both quite honored to have you accept our invitation. You grace us with 
your presence my lady.&quot; The two women nodded at each other and looked to 
Miki, who came to introduce himself.

&quot;Ah! Princess Anthy...I&#39;m pleased that you would join us on such short 
notice. You&#39;re looking absolutely splendid this morning.&quot; He bent to 
kiss her hand, rising and pushing a lock of pale blue hair from his 
eyes. Miki always seemed to have that sweetly innocent air about him, 
untouched by the dark secrets he no doubt had to know working in the 
lower levels. He was also one of the few people Anthy had ever been able 
to talk to, albeit secretly. It was he who had aided her in originally 
discovering the scrolls about the Guardian...and it was he who was one 
of the few friends she could truly count on in the castle.

Everyone settled down, and Utena found herself resting on her knees 
adjacent to the princess and Miki, with Kozue across from her. There was 
some polite small talk, Miki fidgeting somewhat nervously as his sister 
took charge of the conversation and told a few riddles. A break came 
when Miki finally seemed to be able to stand it no longer.

&quot;My lady, please forgive me...but I simply must ask, and please don&#39;t 
take this badly but...but. Just what are you.&quot; All eyes turned to see 
Miki staring at Utena intently, his forehead leaning towards her 
purposefully. Kozue paused in mid-joke and raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Well now, dear brother...that&#39;s not quite how I would have phrased it. 
But I guess that is because of who you are.&quot;

Utena regarded him with an arched brow as well, returning the stare 
fully. &quot;What am I? How do you mean? I am a Guardian&quot; She said 
cryptically. Was it her imagination, or did there seem to be something 
weird about his eyes? Using her magnifying eye lenses to peer closer 
without moving her head, the mental readout showed that...there was a 
strange &quot;S&quot; shape super-imposed on the iris of his eye. And not only 
that, the slightly brighter blue band of color on his eyes seemed to be 
pulsing slightly...as if someone had lit a dim flashlight behind his 
eyes. Quirking her mouth slightly she cocked her own head to the side. 
&quot;Just what are you?&quot;

Anthy turned from one to the other as Miki cleared his throat. &quot;Ah hem! 
Very well, perhaps I may offer a trade of information Guardian? Forgive 
my frankness...and you as well Princess... But I&#39;m a mage. And we have a 
difficult time believing in gods and whatnot without dissecting the 
intricate web of magiks that lay behind them.&quot; Turning to Utena, &quot;I am a 
man of alchemy, in service to the king. A mage...a user of magick and 
one who bends the very laws of nature to his whims! Err...with practice 
of course.&quot; Miki declared, clarifying a bit as Utena looked at him with 
a blank expression. A &#39;man&#39; of alchemy...he looked like nothing more 
than a young boy though, she thought in amusement. Utena gave a slow 
nod. &quot;Ah...more of this magik then...I see.&quot;

Anthy smiled at her, the smile creasing at the corners of her mouth as 
her eyes danced in merriment. &quot;I&#39;m afraid it is inescapable, Holy 
Guardian...magik is indeed everywhere in this world. You&#39;ll have to get 
used to it.&quot; Kozue leaned slightly towards the Princess as she shifted 
her weight to rest on one planted arm.

&quot;Oh? Does the Guardian not like magick?&quot; She asked, interest piqued. 
Utena shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve had very much exposure to 
it...but where I am from there is little need.&quot;

Miki appeared taken aback, his mouth opening in surprise. &quot;Oh? No magik 
at all? Oh dear then how did you come to possess such a fabulous suit of 
armor? Or move the way you do? Surely there must be some sort of 
artifact of power used as a focus conduit with a movable ritual 
circle... Oh! And you never answered my earlier question. I know it was 
rather rude...but I&#39;m very curious about you. To be honest, I&#39;ve been 
wanting to meet you since your arrival.&quot; Miki&#39;s eyes looked her over as 
if he could look into the depths of her being, where normal eyes 
couldn&#39;t penetrate. His voice took on a hollow ringing tone. &quot;You 
are...not mortal, this is clear. But my mage sight picks up light 
threads all over you, like lightning...your metal moves strangely...and 
there is clockwork mechanisms inside of you so complex I cannot fathom 
it&#39;s creation...you&#39;re so strange...so alien...I wonder what truly 
fashioned you...&quot; he paused with a start as his sister laid a hand on 
his arm.

&quot;Please Miki, you&#39;re being rude. This is no way to behave in front of a 
god and our Princess.&quot; She gave him a stern look.

He smiled sheepishly, ducking his head in embarrassment. &quot;Forgive 
me.&quot;Utena found herself softening a little at that expression. He seemed 
so unsure of himself...one minute he was confident and at ease with a 
wisdom beyond his years, but the next he was nothing more than a little 
boy with his hand caught in the cookie jar. His sister seemed all 
confidence however, never hesitating in her actions or speech. There was 
something about the way her eyes tracked them that bothered Utena 
however... Shaking the feeling she gave Miki a warm smile.

&quot;Ah... &quot;Say-ron&quot;...Lord Kaoru was it?&quot; Utena tried. Anthy nodded her 
head minutely to confirm. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that I cannot go into details for 
you...my story is my own, and I am what I am. There are no longer any 
others like me.&quot; Her words came out a little flat. But they were true. 
&quot;However...I was once human. And Dios changed me, bringing me to his 
home and creating this body as you see it. Now that I am here, I can 
only complete the mission he gave me so long ago: To protect this 
kingdom, its rulers, and people.&quot;

Utena moved a strand of hair from her face, a slight breeze picking up 
over the quiet picnic blanket. A daffodil&#39;s seeds blew off and danced 
about in front of their upturned faces, floating away like summer time 
snowflakes. Anthy reached out to touch one, her voice breaking the quiet 
like a ripple in a still pond.

&quot;And we are very grateful that you are here. This kingdom needs someone 
like you...&quot;

Miki smiled at that, a little sad for a moment. &quot;Yes...we do. I would be 
interested in hearing your tale sometime, Holy Guardian. I hope you will 
tell it to me.&quot;

Why do they look so sad? Is there something happening here within the 
kingdom I&#39;m not aware of, or did something happen in the past? Filing 
her thoughts for later, Utena suddenly remembered something and decided 
to change the topic.

&quot;Lor--&quot;

&quot;Please. I would ask you call me Miki.&quot; The mage lord smiled. Utena 
found herself smiling back.

&quot;Miki. Then please, call me Utena. The &#39;Holy Guardian&#39; business is 
getting tiring.&quot; She grinned, and then folded her hands together. &quot;I had 
heard from Lady Juri that you were quite the skilled engineer. A mage 
who had the genius of a craftsman...&quot;

Miki blushed. &quot;Lady Juri praises me too highly...I am skilled enough to 
make the things the king requires.&quot; He brushed a strand of blue hair 
from his eyes. Kozue, who had been quietly watching them, piped up and 
reached inside her hand bag to produce an object.

&quot;My dear brother is one of the greatest mages on the continent. He has 
consulted older mages far beyond his years and taken the Red Plain of 
Trials earlier than anyone recorded in history! He also can make nearly 
anything. See? Is it not clever?&quot; She held out her hand to show them 
what looked like for all the world to Utena, a small pocket watch. Then, 
she watched mystified as with a whispered touch and a soft word from 
Kozue, numbers glowed on its surface. Gasping Anthy leaned closer and 
clapped her hands together. &quot;Oh how marvelous!&quot;

Utena grinned, shaking her head in surprise. &quot;You were able to create a 
digital watch.&quot;

Miki looked bemused. &quot;Dee-jeh-tal? I&#39;m sorry but...there is a name for 
this? I wasn&#39;t aware someone had already invented it, how embarrassing.&quot; 
Utena felt badly then, seeing him blush a little.

&quot;Well no I--&quot; she picked up the device gingerly feeling a little guilty 
at his hurt feelings. But as she inspected it, she shook her head. &quot;Well 
no it&#39;s not digital I suppose...it&#39;s...not made with anything I&#39;ve ever 
seen. But there are small fluctuations on some of my energy sensors...is 
it...made with magik and not electricity?&quot;

Miki nodded. &quot;Yes! But...you can record the time with electricity? Like 
bottled lightning?Isn&#39;t that rather dangerous? We&#39;ve tried experimenting 
with such things, but last time we lost 4 members of our brotherhood 
when the workshop caught fire and exploded. The notion seems absurd.&quot;

Utena handed the magik watch back to Kozue. &quot;I keep forgetting things 
are different in this world. I really do need a crash course on your 
magick sometime..but, what I had wanted to ask you originally is if you 
could perhaps help me, Miki.&quot;

Anthy cocked her head to the side, thinking. Then her expression cleared 
with understanding as she looked down at a sack tied onto Utena&#39;s 
belt.&quot;Ah! You wish to ask Seiron Miki about your helm.&quot; Utena turned to 
her and nodded in affirmative.

Miki waited with curiosity burning in his eyes again as Utena untied the 
small leather sack and produced several large jagged pieces of metal. 
They were the remains of her helm, cleaved by the Kyouichi General. Miki 
took them in his hands carefully, running his hands over them as he 
explored with gentle fingertips the groves and symbols carved all over 
their surface. Identical to the suit of armor Utena wore. He murmured to 
himself, as his hands began to glow with a neon blue light, leaving 
strange thready trails in the air they passed through as he inspected 
the helm. His strange eyes looked into hers, a warm smile breaking out 
on his face.

&quot;This is truly the most beautiful craftsmanship I have ever seen...the 
smith could not repair this could he?&quot;

Both Anthy and Utena shook their head. Kozue leaned closer to Miki to 
get a better look, but didn&#39;t touch it.

&quot;Ah. And no wonder...there are other forces besides metal that went to 
into this great work. But I believe that with small effort, I can repair 
this.&quot; All at once Miki was badly startled as Utena unexpectedly reached 
over and clapped him hard on the shoulder in excitement.

&quot;Really?! This is wonderful news! If you can fix this for me, I would be 
in your debt...this helm means more to me than my own life.&quot; Her 
expression jubilant she found Anthy smiling as well, appearing happy for 
her. Miki, having gotten over the uncharacteristic display of emotion, 
grinned and rubbed the back of his head. &quot;O-Oh it&#39;s no problem, Lady 
Utena...I&#39;m happy to help you. And please...you owe me nothing. I would 
just like to get to know you better from now on and learn from you. 
Perhaps we can have that...&quot;Crashing Coarse?&quot; on magik some time, in 
exchange for you telling me about the Realm of the Spirits a little bit. 
It would be invaluable.&quot;

Utena smiled and nodded. &quot;A deal then.&quot; They shook hands formally as 
Kozue sighed.&quot;Please forgive me, Hol-...er...Lady Utena? Princess Anthy. 
But the day has grown late and I must depart. I have an appointment I 
cannot miss.&quot; Everyone rose to see her off, Kozue helping Anthy to her 
feet before Utena could and adjusting the Princess long skirts with a 
minute swipe of her hands. Miki kissed his sister&#39;s hand as they briefly 
embraced. &quot;I shall see you at supper later, brother.&quot; Anthy gracefully 
nodding her head in tune with Kozue&#39;s curtsy before the young woman 
departed.

When she had left, Utena smiled a little wistfully. &quot;You and your sister 
seem close.&quot; She could see the twins warm attachment, and remembered the 
fondness with which Akio and Kanae had treated Anthy earlier. Things 
like that...weren&#39;t common back home. It made her feel a twinge of 
regret.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Miki murmured, sitting back down. &quot;We&#39;re all we have. But I 
wonder for how much longer.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The soft sounds of mewling resounded in the large bedroom that belonged 
to the King, as indiscernible shapes shifted and moved beneath the silk 
sheets and furs. A small click and a low creaking was heard as a side 
door opened and Kozue let herself in. There was a pause in the rustling, 
and Akio&#39;s face moved to peer over his naked shoulder. He was barely 
breathing hard, but his skin looked flushed as he smiled seductively at 
his little spy. Kozue had taken a seat on the posh lounge chair facing 
the bed.

&quot;Ah. Back so soon I see? And have you anything interesting to report to 
me, my dear?&quot; He returned his attentions to his Queen lying beneath him, 
too far gone in her own passions to pay Kozue&#39;s presence any mind. 
Kissing his way down her heaving chest as she writhed, he listened as 
Kozue spoke dispassionately.

&quot;The clinking knight isn&#39;t natural, and Miki can attest to that. I don&#39;t 
know what she is and neither does he, but they both agree she isn&#39;t 
human. However, she seems pretty uninformed about how things work. Has 
no real clue or inclination about anything magikal if my observations 
are any proof. There could be a weakness there, her uninformed status. 
Miki intends to meet with her in the future and talk with her. And she 
and the Princess are still as close as ever...but I smell something off 
between them lately. Something happened at those ruins.&quot; She crossed her 
arms and leaned back, watching the royal pair with mild interest. Akio 
paused with his lips just above Kanae&#39;s belly button.

&quot;Allow them to meet, but do not let the Guardian enter the Lower Castle. 
I do not want her sniffing around in places she shouldn&#39;t. Not until 
we&#39;re ready. Besides...if my sources are correct, she&#39;ll have plenty to 
keep her busy rather soon.&quot;

Kozue arched an eyebrow, picking up a goblet from a nearby table and 
sipping from it. Grimacing she put it back. &quot;Oh? Then the Black Thorns 
are on the move?&quot; Her answer came from somewhere in a tangle of limbs 
and bed coverings.

&quot;Mmm...indeed. And sooner than originally anticipated. A small force 
should have already detached to plot a small attack on the city with a 
group of battle mages and rouge knights they&#39;ve enlisted.&quot; He fell quiet 
once more, resuming his work. Kanae gasped and arched her back sharply 
as his hot mouth disappeared between her legs.

Kozue mulled over that, still amazed at the King&#39;s ability to ferret out 
the most secret of information. &quot;I truly do not know how you find out 
these things your Majesty, but I&#39;m impressed. What would you have me do. 
Inform the Order?&quot;

Akio rolled over onto his back, propped up on the numerous pillow. The 
covers pooled around his waist. His green cat eyes regarded her, 
churning with unknown thoughts.

&quot;No. We will inform no one. Let them come and attack as they please, 
with no one the wiser. My people will have already been moved to safety, 
and the Lower Castle will not be penetrated. Rather...this shall work to 
our advantage. Let us see how the pawns will react to this bold message. 
I&#39;m curious to see what the Guardian and my dear sister will do... The 
chaos that will result will be in our favor.&quot;

Kozue grinned, sleek and feral from her place on the couch. A voyeur and 
spy with a heart as cold as ice. &quot;Oooo...How lovely. I do like games. It 
would seem your plans are coming together quite wonderfully, your 
Majesty.&quot;

Akio stroked Kanae&#39;s bare shoulder absently. He paid the shivering woman 
no mind, certain she could never disobey him and hinder his plans. &quot;So 
it would seem. Thank your brother for me again by the way...his work is 
most excellent. Far greater than he shall ever know.&quot; He smirked as 
mention of Kozue&#39;s brother caused her hackles to rise ever so slightly.

&quot;...Thank you your Majesty. And...of course Miki shall be well protected 
in the midst of this upcoming attack.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. But Akio 
answered it anyway.

&quot;But of course my dear little pet. Your precious brother shall be safely 
stowed away in the Lower Castle along with my most trusted. You need not 
be concerned.&quot;

Kozue nodded and rose to leave. Akio smirked as she glanced backward 
once, before smoothing her expression into a more proper ladylike one. 
She disappeared as silent as a shadow back the way she came.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Having departed from the picnic, leaving Miki with her helm and warm 
words of farewell, Utena and Anthy found themselves suddenly quite 
alone. They had retreated to the rose garden, Anthy not having any 
appointments currently with village representatives. She was now 
kneeling in front of the roses, her expression distant as she reached 
out to gently cup a blossom and bring it to her face. Utena was standing 
immobile just to the side of her, some paces away. The armored time 
traveler watched as the dark princess breathed silently before releasing 
it. And for a moment...Utena was unable to think of anything to say. Her 
mental processes seemed to have slowed down as Anthy rose from her 
lowered position and stood upright to turn and face her fully. Their 
eyes caught. The sun was back lit on her shoulders now, throwing shadows 
across her velvet covered form.

Utena froze as the princess strode up to her, eyes noticing hips that 
swayed minutely beneath her long green dress. She was suddenly close, 
the knight feeling odd and hazy, as Anthy twined her arms up around her 
neck. There was a small scratching sensation along her scalp just above 
her right ear. And as the princess brought her arms down again, Utena 
reached up to feel a small rose placed there. When had she picked the 
rose? Or had she held it all along and Utena simply had been a bit too 
distracted to notice.

&quot;It compliments you nicely.&quot; Anthy said, smiling softly up at her as 
Utena&#39;s fingertips lowered.

&quot;Hmm. I shall have to take your word for it. Though I feel that it may 
look more suitable on you.&quot; Utena admitted, feeling that growing 
fondness for the other woman rising again. This was once the dirty 
little slave girl who had rescued her from that cave... Anthy was like a 
rose herself, finally blooming.

&quot;Ah. But on that I may disagree.&quot; Anthy turned once more towards the 
roses, but remained close by as the Guardian joined her in carefully 
admiring them. The two of them fell into comfortable silence once more. 
Utena traced a finger along a tight spiral of petals, soft as skin, and 
let her hand cup it as she had seen Anthy do earlier.

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry if I upset you yesterday.&quot;

Utena froze and retracted her hand a bit quickly. The thorns of the rose 
snagged her skin and left a small scratch along her index finger. The 
scratch slowly filled with blood, but Utena didn&#39;t notice.

&quot;Up..Upset me? I&#39;m not sure what you...&quot;

&quot;Your forgiveness...I did not mean to bring up unpleasantness. But..it 
was my fault what happened at the ruins yesterday. You were injured 
saving us, and we discovered that room where... And then those bandits 
attacked. I know it is much to ask a being like yourself, even with my 
being a-ah, a &#39;princess&#39;. But...what I did was shameful and foolish. I 
am sorry for it.&quot;

Mind reeling, Utena stood and broke her own rules of boundaries by 
gently placed a hand on Anthy&#39;s shoulder to get the young woman to look 
at her. &quot;Anthy...you need not apologize. I am not upset about it. I did 
only what needed to be done to protect you. I was glad to do it.&quot;

&quot;But I monopolized your time...you&#39;re supposed to be looking after an 
entire kingdom and not just some stupid worthless girl--&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Utena&#39;s stern voice interrupted her. But much softer she 
continued, &quot;No. Not stupid. Never worthless. You are not worthless, 
Anthy.&quot; Utena gave her a small gentle smile. &quot;I&#39;m your bodyguard. That 
was what would have been my duties back home, a servant to the throne 
dedicated to protecting it. You and I are bound by a contract...and you 
need not worry about my time or my mission. I know what I must do...and 
there is plenty of time for me to do so. But you are my priority and I 
won&#39;t let any harm come to you.&quot;

Anthy seemed to take heart in this, for she placed her smaller hand over 
the knight&#39;s own on her shoulder.

&quot;Thank you...I was just worried because...well...you seemed to be 
avoiding me since last night. I felt a distance...&quot;

Utena colored a little and removed her hand, looking away. &quot;Well, that 
was more... If I seemed distant, I apologize.&quot; I&#39;m the one who should 
apologize. I&#39;m the one who fell apart. Who frightened you... Bearing 
this in mind, the cyborg gave a small cough into her hand.

&quot;I am glad then.&quot; Anthy seemed to sense her discomfort. &quot;And...I want 
you to know that you may put your trust in me. I would never betray 
you...and I am a willing ear if you ever need to ease your mind.&quot; She 
said carefully, looking once more into the pink-haired woman&#39;s eyes. 
Utena straightened, but then relaxed a little.

&quot;Thank you. I do trust you. It&#39;s just...I...I am still feeling ashamed 
at showing such a weakness yesterday.&quot; Utena sighed and turned slightly 
to cross her arms. &quot;It was poor form.&quot;

Anthy moved to place one hand on the pale woman&#39;s armored bicep, patting 
it lightly. &quot;You said you were mortal once. Perhaps it is blasphemy but 
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve completely lost your humanity. It&#39;s alright to feel 
things, Utena.&quot; Anthy tugged at her arms to get her to uncross them, and 
then took her hands in her own. She looked down and noticed the small 
scratch on Utena&#39;s finger.

&quot;Blasphemy. Gods. Holiness, angels, demons...Dios. I am not a god. And 
every day with people leaving gifts at my door and praying at me it 
feels like a charade. A necessary one surely, but I remember being 
human. Though I&#39;m afraid that still doesn&#39;t allow me to act like one.&quot;

Anthy dabbed at Utena&#39;s finger with a handkerchief she produced, looking 
up as Utena&#39; voice had fallen into a whisper. &quot;Why can&#39;t you?&quot; she asked 
just as softly. They had leaned closer to one another as they spoke. The 
air felt heavy with unspoken history.

&quot;Because it&#39;s a dishonor to what I am, and to his memory. I&#39;m a soldier, 
Anthy.&quot;

Blue eyes were locked onto green. Neither moving...both scarcely 
breathing

&quot;You don&#39;t have to just be such. Not anymore.&quot; There. She had said it. 
Their bodies were hidden by the trellises of the sacred rose gardens and 
safe from prying eyes, and Utena suddenly felt something as Anthy broke 
off and looked down at her breastplate. The knight&#39;s eyes followed her 
eyes to the rose symbol emblazoned there. But those feelings were 
immediately shuffled and pushed aside from training, and buried deep 
under protocol where they could do no harm. That is until--

Anthy raised the pale hands she still held, and bent her head down and 
placed a gentle kiss on the small scratch along her finger. It had 
stopped bleeding some time ago. Utena suddenly forgot to breathe. Bells 
from the towers above the castle rang, signifying the time. But Utena 
barely heard them, all focus on the soft warmth pressed along her digit.

The moment was but an instant and Anthy then released her hands, turning 
from her. Her expression was hidden and her voice steady and serene as 
always.

&quot;It is growing late. I imagine a servant will be looking for us soon. 
Perhaps we can still get in time to visit the map maker&#39;s dwelling like 
you had wanted the other day.&quot;

Utena cleared her throat to speak, making sure to keep any trace of 
conflicted emotion out of it. &quot;Ah, that would be excellent. What I 
really need is a good map of the kingdom and surrounding lands.&quot;

Utena escorted the princess back inside to where servants had indeed 
been sent to see to their needs. They were greeted by nobles as they 
made their way through the castle and what had become the mundane life 
slowly swirled back around them like a protective cloak. For all Utena&#39;s 
advanced technology, she didn&#39;t notice her charge&#39;s hand shaking at her 
side.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The next few days passed in a flurry of activity. The council members 
seemed to have taken quite an interest in the Guardian, Anthy noticed 
with some chagrin. Juri and Touga were often coming to call, sometimes 
together, finding excuses in simple matters of state they wished to 
discuss with the princess and the clockwork knight. Utena pretended not 
to notice the subtle flirting that seemed to accompany these visits, 
though Wakaba would loudly complain about it whenever she and the 
servants would come in later to clean. Sometimes when Anthy was busy 
with her duties, Utena would wander down to the training grounds and 
engage Saionji for a bit of &#39;practice&#39;. Few of these encounters didn&#39;t 
result in broken swords and words harsher than the bruises they both 
received. Which Utena found immensely satisfying afterwards, to Anthy&#39;s 
bafflement. Miki also came by with news that Lady Tenjou&#39;s helm would be 
completed soon.

But for the most part the main portion of the castle&#39;s focus was on 
preparations for the grand ball that had been planned. The King was 
sparing no expense, and already messengers were arriving from around the 
country side with the aide of magick and other means to bring word of 
their masters&#39; pending arrival. Great tapestries and gifts were already 
arriving and being set out to be displayed. The stones were carefully 
scrubbed and the wooden tables polished and laid out with decorative 
cloths. Garlands and candelabras were placed while the kingdom&#39;s best 
gourmands prepared for the featured dishes. The Tailor&#39;s Guild was 
working overtime to produce dresses and formal wear for the noblemen and 
women. Anthy was sure she&#39;d never seen so many dresses in her life, all 
carefully brought out and displayed to her as her measurements were 
retaken and she was outfitted with several pairs of slippers. It was all 
quite exhausting.

Often she longed to steal away and just go for a ride. She&#39;d been tense 
for days about this ball.. Anthy knew her brother too well not to 
constantly be looking over her shoulder as she went about daily 
business. He had to be planning something...he was always planning. But 
strangely he&#39;d been acting kind to her ever since the Guardian had 
arrived. He hadn&#39;t even called her for anything after hours. She was no 
longer a slave to his twisted cruelty and desires, because of the 
Guardian&#39;s protective influence. Anthy was thankful, but nevertheless 
remained suspicious. A viper just doesn&#39;t suddenly forget it&#39;s sting... 
Her &#39;dear brother&#39; would not forget his ambitions and his plans to gain 
them. Not that he had ever included her in his plans, but Anthy had 
overheard and seen enough to know he was preparing for something. And in 
the off time would find amusement at punishing her privately for her 
crimes...

She shook her head free of her musings, nearly upsetting the tiara that 
had been placed upon her brow. No. He&#39;d drawn back. No doubt it was the 
Guardian&#39;s presence that made him cautious. But Anthy couldn&#39;t help but 
feel that being next to the Guardian kept her at arm&#39;s length from 
learning the things that she felt she needed to. She hadn&#39;t dared to go 
to the Lower Castle since her return. Perhaps she should consider it...

A knock came at the door.

&quot;Your majesty? There are some documents here from the king. He requested 
you to go over them for the ball.&quot; A page said from the other side. 
Anthy called him in and quickly accepted the fair-sized stack of 
parchment. In neat handwriting was a long list of names and short 
descriptions for each of them. A list of the guests to 
memorize...lovely.

Sending the page on his way, Anthy sighed and settled down in her chair. 
Her room was empty for the moment, save herself. The maids bustling out 
to prepare the spare rooms for the arriving dignitaries and Utena 
dismissed to take care of some errands in town and to meet with Saionji 
for a final bout before things became too hectic in the next couple of 
days. The ball was set for 3 days time, and she had been mulling over 
security.

Utena... Anthy sighed and leaned back in her chair. She passed a single 
fingertip across her lips, her skin glowing like warm cinnamon in the 
orange light of the setting sun. Her dreams had been filled with long 
rose-colored hair, small hidden smiles and sapphire eyes. Eyes that were 
haunted by a past she didn&#39;t know. That and Anthy&#39;s own guilty conscious 
kept her up at night. She was slowly going mad she knew..and there 
seemed little she could do about it.

Utena...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Alright then you clinking devil. This time you won&#39;t walk away with 
victory!&quot; Saionji declared as he stretched his arms out and rolled his 
practice sword about in his hand. He&#39;d stripped to the waist leaving 
only his black leather gloves. Utena had removed her armor, clad in her 
men&#39;s breeches and short-sleeved cotton top. A headband kept her pink 
pony tail from coming loose into her eyes.

&quot;You say that every time...maybe if you flapped your gums less and swung 
your sword more you&#39;d stand a better chance.&quot;

They squared off in the ring of dirt that was fenced off from the rest 
of the training grounds. Soldiers and knights went about their drills 
and tried not to be caught lingering to watch the two sword masters as 
they circled one another and began their dance. The blunt steel rang as 
they clashed, the force driving their arms into constant motion as they 
parried and sliced. The sun was setting on them and the sky was 
gradually beginning to fade to darkness as they fought on.

Their attacks over their matches had grown less hateful and less aimed 
to permanently maim and kill. Amazingly. Over time it had evolved into 
more of an actual sparring match, with an edge of competition to it. 
Saionji whirled in close for a sweeping cut, and Utena slid to the side 
to defend it. By the time the sun had shrank to a low line on the 
horizon and the sky grown too dark to see anything but the dark 
silhouettes of their bodies, they were covered in sweat. Well...one of 
them anyway.

Their practice at an end, Saionji stumbled for a drink from the barrel 
of water set aside just for that reason. &quot;It is just damn uncanny how 
you don&#39;t even seem to tire. Not natural.&quot;

Utena shrugged, putting up her sword and retrieving her real one. &quot;I can 
tire...it just takes a bit more effort and doesn&#39;t show so easily.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re still unnatural.&quot; And Utena rolled her eyes. Finding herself 
meandering a bit, she moved to take a seat up on the wooden fence as 
Saionji mopped his brow. He took a moment to glance at her before 
sitting up on the fence as well an arm&#39;s length away.

&quot;Not bad today though. But I wonder if you&#39;re beginning to rust in that 
ridiculous armor of yours.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Well of course I would start to rust, if all I have to practice 
on is you.&quot;

Surprisingly, Saionji cracked a small smirk at this and didn&#39;t rise to 
the bait. He seemed to have something on his mind. He glowered at the 
air a moment before giving a huff and coming to a mental decision.

&quot;Listen. You&#39;re the important Guardian and whatnot, and the entire 
castle is orbiting about to your beck and whim. I don&#39;t care about that. 
But...I&#39;ll give you a bit of advice. Payment for giving me something to 
sink my teeth into besides that acidic Arisugawan woman.&quot;

Utena looked over at him and waited, frowning slightly herself in 
anticipation.

&quot;I&#39;d be careful about putting a lot of trust in that princess of yours. 
Anthy isn&#39;t natural either.&quot; Seeing Utena&#39;s face darken and her mouth 
open to retort but he held up a hand, his face strangely serious and 
stoic. &quot;Hear my words...there aren&#39;t many of them. I&#39;ve know 
that...woman...far longer than you have. I imagine you had better things 
to do up there on your cloud. She&#39;s not what she appears to be, and 
she&#39;s certainly not human. Just...be cautious how much stock you put in 
that princess of yours. She&#39;s cursed after all.&quot; Saionji finished, 
hopping up from the fence. Utena got up as well, a scowl on her face.

&quot;Well I can hardly believe anything you have to--&quot; loud bells suddenly 
rang without warning making them both look up in alarm. Men began 
shouting in the distance and suddenly pandemonium broke out on the 
training grounds. Knights everywhere dropped what they were doing and 
took off running for the gates.

Saionji, moving at a sudden flash of speed was already over the fence, 
buckling on his armor over his shirt, and fastening his great sword onto 
his back. He was merely two steps behind Utena in her cryo-suit. The two 
armored figures ran after the crowd of knights that had disappeared as 
shouts from the castle walls rang out.

&quot;Intruders!! Battle mages are attacking the--&quot;

A loud roar shrieked out, and suddenly a huge blast of fire exploded 
from the castle wall to one side sending men to the ground far below in 
a rain of broken stone. Another blast of flame smashed into the wall at 
the other end as men shrieked in death. Utena parted from the green 
general who had gone off shouting into the distance as he gathered his 
men around him, and leapt up onto the smoldering wall itself with a 
single great kick. Her eyes widened at what they saw.

In the distance, her optical lenses magnified the castle town in flames 
as black armored knights with white tabards attacked the villagers. A 
line of figures in white cloaks were waving their hands in strange 
patterns appearing to be chanting at the castle. Suddenly Utena rocketed 
off her feet as a missile made of explosive flames screamed into 
existence in front of them and blasted the portion of the wall she had 
been standing on. She caught herself on a portion of the remaining ledge 
and dragged herself back up. Saionji&#39;s men were on horses and were now 
pouring out the gates to join the small force that had already engaged 
the invaders.

Her eyes narrowed to slits. Anthy! She had to see about those in the 
castle! Shooting into action, the cyborg was a blur of movement as she 
dodge volleys of magic fire and lightning and raced along the wall and 
leapt down to the courtyard below. Servants were rushing about 
frantically as nobles tried to flee in fear to who knew where. Soldiers 
were bolstering the castle defenses and locking things into place as the 
castle&#39;s own mages tried to move into action.

&quot;Stand aside!&quot; Utena declared shoving past a man who knocked into her. 
He skidded back on his rump. Where in the bleeding hells was Anthy.

&quot;Holy Guardian!&quot; Utena turned and saw Baron Tsuchiya shoulder is way to 
her. &quot;Holy Guardian, what is happening?! Who is attacking us?!&quot; he had 
to shout to be heard over the den of noise raised by the sounds of 
combat getting closer.

&quot;Men in black armor and white tabards! They came without warning. Where 
is Princess Anthy?!&quot; They both gave a cry as the ground quacked 
tremendously beneath them. Servants and nobles alike were sent to their 
backs. Ruka and Utena stayed up only with her bracing them both.

&quot;The Black Thorns!&quot; Ruka swore. &quot;I do not know the princess&#39; whereabouts 
but no doubt she is being protected. We must defend the castle. Please, 
for the sake of your followers...please defend us!&quot; Ruka begged, his 
face grim as he held out his wooden medallion and bent his head. Shaking 
her head Utena impatiently made him rise by pushing his shoulders.

&quot;Of course I will, you needn&#39;t ask. This is my duty. I am the Guardian!&quot; 
but it was dangerous how she&#39;s nearly flown off to look for Anthy 
anyway, instead of heading immediately to neutralize the threat. She 
felt a moment of indecision. &quot;Find the Princess and make sure of hers 
and the King and Queen&#39;s safety. I shall deal with these Thorns.&quot;

Her face a hard line, Utena raced out into the burning darkness. Ruka 
saw only the wind of her passing.

Out past the gates it was madness. Just as it had been in the days 
before. Balls of flame continued to smash into the wall and gate and 
bodies littered the ground. Saionji was leading his knights valiantly 
against the invading ones in the town, but the battle mages kept pushing 
them back with spells. Green dragons made of lighting exploded into 
existence, tornadoes sprang to life and roared through the lines, 
boulders ripped up from the ground and suddenly smashed into fragile 
human bodies. There was cries of pain barely heard over the clash of 
steal and the twang of crossbows. A horse screamed in the dark. It was 
like nothing Utena had ever seen before. And yet it was like everything 
she had seen before.

Castle Ohtori had deployed their own battle mages nearly immediately, 
but they had stood no chance against the enemy&#39;s careful tactics. Nearly 
two dozen men in blue robes lay twisted and broken amongst the rubble 
and bodies knights and animals. Utena wondered if young Miki was among 
them.

It was time to end this.

Her face hardening into one of cold finality, Utena raised her sword 
high and shouted. Heads twisted in her direction with surprise as 
quicker than thought she shot forward with a lunging run. A whirl of 
silver was all that could be made of her holy sword as she cut through a 
line of enemy knights blocking her path. Their cries were brief as they 
fell in pieces, and the castle knights filed in right behind her without 
hesitation.

Leaping into the air, she jumped into a broken wagon bed and then onto a 
small platform that had was all that remained of a village guard shack. 
Her blue electric eyes bleeding pale fire, Utena jumped into the middle 
of a skirmish between village survivors and a gaggle of Black Thorns. 
Making quick work of them she didn&#39;t stop moving, heading back towards 
the mages.

But she paused as a wave of blue energy came rushing at her from the 
side. Taking out her sword, she sliced it in half and sent it to either 
side. The wave leveled a few trees. Magick...magick instead of grenades 
and fighter planes and machine guns. That was fine. She could work with 
this. Charging and punching through a large boulder that had been flung 
to meet her, Utena&#39;s face turned into a snarl.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Women shrieked as men hustled to put out fires. The battle in the town 
had come unexpectedly and now people were being evacuated deeper into 
the castle for safety. Anthy was in her room under heavy guard as she 
tried to watch the scene from her window. But she&#39;d been hustled away 
from it for fear of stray arrows and flames. A large explosion from the 
gates signified the battle mages finally breaking through. White-faced, 
the guards grimly tightened ranks.

A large tremor went through the castle as explosions pelted the sides of 
the castle itself. The head guard shouted orders but was cut-off as 
Anthy&#39;s world suddenly flashed white.

She was suddenly looking up at the burning ceiling, not knowing how she 
got there but feeling her entire body aching from an impact. Rolling 
slowly to her side, she came face to face with a charred guard who&#39;d 
been killed by the initial blast. And explosion had torn away a good 
chunk of the wall facing outward, leaving a gaping maw. There was only 
darkness and empty space beyond as Anthy stumbled to her feet. She 
couldn&#39;t seem to stop her ears from ringing. Dimly she felt someone 
shaking her and saw Ruka and Touga each taking an arm. They were 
shouting something but she couldn&#39;t hear them.

There was something hot sliding down the side of her face that she knew 
must be blood. The ceiling above them shivered in warning as they tried 
to move her out of the burning room rescue the remaining guards. There 
weren&#39;t many.

Anthy&#39;s mind began piecing thoughts together in fragments Of 
course...they were on the top-most story with a tower above them...the 
blast probably took out most of the support. As if in answer to her 
thoughts, a section of the ceiling bowed outward. Touga and Ruka dove 
with her out of the way as stone blocks rained down from that part of 
the ceiling, burying two standing guards. The rest would come down soon 
any moment. Anthy closed her eyes and steadied herself as she fought 
nausea in order to concentrate.

She needed to focus...summon a shield or maybe a familiar too--

&quot;--Ncess...Rincess...Princess! There&#39;s no time, please we need to--&quot;

&quot;Ruka! I...I think my leg is caught.&quot;

Ruka looked and sure enough Touga&#39;s leg was pinned. Going pale he set to 
trying to lift up the bits of stone that had pinned the long-haired man 
but was pushed aside by Anthy.

&quot;There&#39;s no time! Please move, Baron!&quot; Her eyes flashing green, Anthy 
dabbed her fingers in the blood that ran stickily down the side of her 
head and began making hand signs in the air. A faint glowing figure of a 
two-headed dog appeared from a magic circle that formed in the air 
before her. Dropping to the ground with a ghostly growl, it began 
picking up huge junks of stone with it&#39;s jaws and soon had Touga free. 
Several more of the demon dogs appeared and with their teeth, began 
dragging the bodies of still breathing soldiers out through the doorway 
and then dissipating to whence they came. Anthy helped Ruka get Touga 
painfully to his feet. But as they were heading to the doorway a loud 
groan came from overhead. Wooden beams splintered and Anthy screamed as 
the two men threw themselves over her in a last bid to protect her, as 
several tons of pure stone came down on top of them.

The last thing Anthy&#39;s eyes saw as the rush of dust and death came down 
over them was the image of Utena smiling at her in the rose garden, a 
flower in her hair...
