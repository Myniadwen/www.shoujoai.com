<h1>Captain of the Guard (part 1 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The carriage bumped, rattled and shook as it sped across the old 
cobblestone streets towards the palace. The princess sitting inside 
was not amused. &#147;I have got to try talking Father into doing some more 
repaving.&#148; Anthy muttered to herself. Then she sighed sadly. Her 
Father&#146;s illness must be getting worse if he had needed to call her 
back from the marriage meetings so soon.

As the carriage rumbled down the lane Anthy put her head out to see 
their progress. &#147;Pouring rain. It figures,&#148; she said. Shaking her 
head, she thought about her destination. The western palace was her 
personal residence, where her most loyal servants and friends resided. 
Anthy was looking forward to seeing most of them again, except one.

&#145;That drunken captain,&#146; Anthy thought with a bit of relief, &#145;I was so 
happy when Miki wrote me he had been finally replaced.&#146; She frowned 
slightly, &#145;But I wonder what he meant when he said he had a surprise 
for me?&#146;

Anthy smiled warmly as the carriage passed through the main gates 
towards the entrance. Standing by the doorway was Miki, her own 
secretary and the head of household, and the new captain, in uniform 
and at attention beside him The shadows kept her from seeing much of 
him, but he looked capable. He was certainly willing to get wet when 
needed, a real improvement over the old one.

As the carriage eased to a stop, Miki stepped forward, opening the 
door, offering his arm and holding a umbrella over Anthy. They made 
their way to the doors, and the captain ducked behind, following them 
respectfully. In the hallway, Anthy smiled and turned, about to ask 
him to walk with them, then the words seemed to die in her throat. She 
saw the clear, robin&#146;s egg blue eyes, the handsome face, and the pink 
hair, all belonging to a striking young woman.

Miki smiled slightly, saying &#147;Princess, meet the new guard captain, 
Tenjou Utena.&#148;

They young woman smiled coolly, making a half salute with her hand to 
her brow. &#147;I&#146;m honored to be in your service, m&#146;lady.

Anthy searched for words under Utena&#146;s steady gaze, when suddenly, 
they heard running feet. Utena lost her composure, her eyes growing 
wide with something like fear.

&#147;Oh, no, not now...&#148; Utena whimpered.

&#147;Utena-sama!&#148; Wakaba yelled in kawaii tones, leapt, and wrapped her 
arms around Utena&#146;s neck and legs around her waist. Anthy couldn&#146;t 
help giggling as Utena staggered about for a moment, fighting for her 
balance. Wakaba peered over Utena&#146;s shoulder and waved cheerfully to 
Anthy.

&#147;What was that all about?&#148; Anthy asked laughing.

Wakaba jumped down, brushing off her maid&#146;s uniform. &#147;Well, when I met 
her a few days ago, I thought, &#145;wow, she&#146;s tall&#146; and I wanted to see, 
so&#148; Wakaba gestured and talked happily a few more moments, Anthy and 
Miki listening with amusement. She stops and bows. &#147;Oh, your rooms 
have already been prepared. See ya!&#148; she said, and galloped off to 
another job.

Miki and Anthy looked at each other and laughed. &#147;Is she always like 
that?&#148; Utena asked, shaking her head and smiling.

&#147;Yes,&#148; Anthy said, and Utena groaned. &#147;And it looks like you&#146;re her 
latest crush.&#148;

Utena sweatdropped. &#147;Don&#146;t worry,&#148; Miki said with a smile, &#147;it usually 
runs its course in a month or so.&#148;

&#147;A month?&#148; Utena echoed softly. She sighed and shook herself. &#147;Let&#146;s 
get you to your rooms, milady.&#148;

They walked up the hallway, and Anthy watched the woman thoughtfully. 
She looked much nicer when she was smiling. Anthy was a bit surprised 
to see a guard outside her room, and a bit more about who it was.

Asugawa Juri stood at attention, her uniform crisp and clean. She had 
a bit of a reputation as a lady-killer, but Anthy didn&#146;t mind. Once 
she had told Juri she wasn&#146;t interested, that was it. The black sheep 
of a noble family, Juri had a lot in common with Anthy, and they had 
become good friends.

&#147;Why a guard at the door?&#148; Anthy asked surprised. Juri smiled and 
saluted when the princess approached.

&#147;An innovation by our new captain,&#148; Juri said in approving tones. Miki 
also nodded agreement.

Anthy sweatdropped. &#145;I&#146;d better agree, because like it or not, the 
guard&#146;s staying if they have anything to say about it,&#146; Anthy thought. 
She moved to open the door, when Utena stopped her. The new captain 
walked in, and checked the parlor, bedroom, bath, and library for any 
intruders, then waved them in. Juri closed the door, and stayed on 
guard outside the room.

&#147;Could I speak with Miki alone?&#148; Anthy asked. Utena frowned a bit, but 
nodded. She began to move, when she saw something. Utena grabbed Anthy 
and dived to the floor, even as the nearby window crashed inward. The 
crossbow bolt hissed through the air, and the sound of tearing cloth 
was heard. Laying beneath her, Anthy looked up into Utena&#146;s face, and 
for a moment, her heart seemed to stop. &#145;She&#146;d so handsome,&#146; Anthy 
thought dazedly.

&#147;Are you all right, Princess?&#148; Utena asked softly, looking down at the 
beautiful younger woman.

&#147;Yes,&#148; Anthy said, smiling. &#147;Thank you,&#148; she said, as Utena pulled her 
to her feet. She watched as Utena barked orders to Miki and Juri, 
before turning back to her.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Princess, but we have to get you out of here.&#148; Utena took 
her arm and all but hustled her out of the room. Anthy noticed the 
tear in the shoulder of Utena&#146;s uniform, and a flash of red.

&#147;Stop, please. Utena, you&#146;re hurt,&#148; Anthy said firmly. Stopping a 
moment, Anthy looked over the wound. &#147;Just a graze, fortunately. Now, 
where are we going?&#148; As she talked, she took a handkerchief and 
carefully wrapped the cut.

&#147;The guard&#146;s wing,&#148; Utena said simply. &#147;It&#146;s a bit rougher than your 
usual quarters, but I can be more certain of your safety while we 
search for the assassin.&#148;

&#147;I understand,&#148; Anthy said with a nod, and followed Utena down the 
hallway. </pre>
