<a href="../utena/special-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>There is nothing as relaxing as a hot bath, and tonight I appreciated 
it more than usual. My meal, a boxed thing I picked up on the street, 
had been good, but I was feeling uneasy. After I had packed my bag for 
tomorrow&#146;s journey (and deposited my client&#146;s check in my account) I 
needed to do something to kill time. I relaxed into the hot water, 
sighing with relief. Several fellow bathers shot me tight smiles and 
returned to their conversations.

My conversation with Tobei had been a surprise, to say the least. When 
he had answered the phone, it seemed like he had been expecting my 
call.

&quot;Yeah, hey.&quot; He was always informal to the point of rudeness. One of 
the things I loved about him when we met.

I told him of Miss Himemiya&#146;s visit, her request, the useless dead end 
in the info she sent me, and my suspicion that something had happened 
to the missing girl. He made a rude noise into the phone.

&quot;Nah, you know, we investigated that angle.&quot; 

They did?

&quot;Yeah &#150; when Miss Himemiya came to town. An executive order was 
received. We were to open a case &#150; missing person&#146;s believed murdered, 
no habeas corpus, or anything, but like a Jane Doe case.&quot; I nodded, 
just what I was thinking.

&quot;Well you know how it is, there&#146;s more pressing things that take up 
your time &#150; we put out the APB, and asked for help from the NPA&#133;of 
course we turned up nothing.&quot;

&quot;No candidates at all?&quot; There had to be *someone* who fit the bill.

&quot;Nope.&quot; I could hear him shrug over the phone. &quot;Houou&#146;s pretty far off 
the beaten path.&quot;

&quot;What about the lure of the big city and all that? Maybe she left 
school and got in trouble in Tokyo.&quot;

&quot;Unh-uh. All the bodies we had were poorer, bad physical condition, 
bad teeth &#150; ya-chan, illegals, foreigners, you know the rap. This girl 
was strong, healthy, athletic. No way they could be her.&quot;

It was my turn to shrug. &quot;So what happened?&quot;

&quot;Well, we sent all that we got to the higher-ups. A week later we get 
an order that we can drop the case. Next day, that robbery on the 
train hits and we&#146;re off to new pastures.&quot;

I made a noncommittal noise.

&quot;You know,&quot; Tobei finished up, &quot;I kept wondering who your Miss 
Himemiya is&#133;someone important enough to get our brass to open a new 
case for her.&quot;

Yeah, I wondered that too. We chatted a bit, reaffirming our next 
night for dinner together, then hung up.

Long after I returned from the bathhouse, I lay there on my bed and 
thought about Himemiya Anshi and her friend, who had disappeared off 
the face of the earth not quite ten years ago.
