The reconstruction of the castle walls and the tower was nearly complete by the time the 
first of the nobles began making their way in the direction of the castle proper. Peasants 
gaped openly as grand horse-pulled caravans, entourages of armored soldiers, and carriages 
of various shapes and refinements made their way through the sprawling castle town of 
Ohtori. Children danced about horse legs begging for coin and shrieking with glee. Peddlers 
and market men shouted out their wares to the rich visitors. Some of the soldiers would 
stop and purchase a flower here or toss a coin to a music player there, and nearly every 
tavern was full to bursting with visitors from various lands. Excitement was brewing in the 
streets, word of the feast had spread far and wide. The King and Queen had recently 
announced a decree that the entire land was to take holiday and celebrate.

Young and old moved about with an energy that had all been lost since the terrible attack 
of the hated Black Thorns. Flower garlands and brightly colored ribbons were hung above the 
cobblestone streets, and mini celebrations were already breaking out here and there as 
night approached. The loss of so many citizens was hardly noticed with the throng of 
unfamiliar faces crowding the streets and stalls, bringing news of distant lands and 
valuable coin to inn keeper pockets. The feast may have been for the nobles, but it had 
drawn plenty of tourists as well. All wanted a glimpse of the dignitaries and kings and 
princes and princesses who would be in attendance.

And a chance to glimpse at true divinity.

Word of the Guardian&#39;s godly defense had spread far and wide. Bards traveled far, carrying 
songs of a sword that blazed of white fire, slaying entire armies with a single swing. Of 
how it could grow to the size of a giant, stamping catapults flat. Of blue eyes that blazed 
like twin suns, and a visage so frightening that many soldiers had seen it and turned to 
flee. Men whispered reverently over their mugs that the Guardian had died...and 
resurrected. Could die a thousand deaths and merely laugh. That Dios himself breathed life 
into its lips and it would never fall. Kaiathi un Dios!Ohtori was blessed!

And...they whispered darkly of Anthy. But it never went far. Merely knowing glances and 
spit on the earth. As if they feared a curse to even speak of their newly returned Rose 
Princess.

But there was enough of that. The last of the coaches had passed through the gate, and with 
it a great cheer rose from the mob of onlookers. Men danced, women sang, musicians played 
drums and flutes, as feet stomped the floor in wild abandon that grew ever fiercer.

At sundown the Great Feast would begin!

Utena paced in her room feeling oddly ill at ease. She&#39;d been besieged with dark thoughts 
since she&#39;d last spoken to Saionji. She&#39;d gone over his note a hundred times but could make 
no sense of it. And though she&#39;d argued hotly, she was now beginning to wonder about her 
Charge... Not that she doubted her. She could never. But it was true that there was a great 
deal about Anthy that she didn&#39;t know. When they spoke, they spoke of the country&#39;s history 
and politics and culture. Of men and war and unrest. Of flowers and sweet sun-ripened 
berries and the scent of roses...soft cloth...the warm scent of her skin...

Utena shook her head to focus once more. Ever since that passionate exchange with Anthy 
atop the altar in the sanctuary, her thoughts would often turn to less than honorable 
things. It was hard to keep her mind on business when she pictured those dark arms twining 
about her body. Of touching her in places she had not been touched in...well ages really. 
Just the memory of petal lips brushing against hers tightened things low in her body and 
had her blushing. True, being with another woman wasn&#39;t alien to her. And Anthy was 
certainly comely. It was all to easy to get caught up in her gaze...but for Utena it simply 
wasn&#39;t allowable for herself to fall under the spell of seduction. No matter how much she 
wanted it.

Absently her gloves reached to stroke the surface of her chest plate. Soft rasps of metal 
on metal, over the place a mechanical rose had sunken into her heart. Where the scar still 
remained... Yes. No matter how much she may want it. Want an intimate connection with the 
person who had awoken her from her sleep, and gave her life again...it wasn&#39;t possible. And 
Anthy had no idea why. Had no idea what was...wrong with her. What Utena herself hadn&#39;t 
realized until the moment Anthy had touched her lips... What was broken the moment Utena 
was &#39;fixed&#39;.

The cyborg felt a moody sadness sweep through her as she gazed out the stone window sill. 
But the neural-chemicals that gently swept through her altered bloodstream soon lost the 
emotion. There was work still. Preparations to be made. Like...convincing herself to just 
go and ask to see Wakaba. She didn&#39;t really trust the other maids or servants to help her 
dress, if Utena was honest with herself. She missed her unlikely friend.

But perhaps she no longer wishes to see me...not after all that has happened. It could be 
that she had scared the girl off. If not at that time outside the old ruins of the news 
station, then surely during her frenzy during the Black Thorn battle. Her memory banks were 
still lapsing over that incident in places. It was as if she&#39;d shorted out and had 
just...run amok. Dangerous. She needed to remain in control of herself at all times. 
Thoughts moved to memories of Anthy&#39;s aroused moans as she exposed the line of her neck. 
Tipping back for easier access as she hiked her thigh...

Utena licked her lips nervously. And let go of the window sill she had been cracking under 
her grip.

Yes. In control. At all times.

Best ring a servant then. Utena suddenly felt the urge for a cold bath.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Anthy sighed dreamily as she stared into her own reflection. Her attendants quietly 
adjusted and laced the gown she was to wear this evening, up-sweeping her hair into her 
small tiara and carefully adorning her with fine jewelry and rings. They never smiled or 
spoke, not cheerful in their duties. As if it were a distasteful chore to even be in her 
presence. Yet their status and position prevented them from voicing such things aloud. So 
they worked silently and quickly, dabbing scented oils behind her ears and on her wrists, 
lacing the sleeves that swept down from her arms and placing her slippers upon her feet. 
Mechanically bringing her a chair to seat her, while they meticulously dressed her. Like 
silent shadows. Like faceless players in a show.

And for once, Anthy didn&#39;t mind. Her thoughts were filled with nothing but Utena, 
anticipation and joy filling her breast at the thought of the rose-haired knight. Tonight&#39;s 
event would be a trial for Anthy she knew. An excuse Akio was using to further his own 
ambitions and privately display her to an array of suitors, no matter what he had said to 
Utena. There were layers and layers of veils hiding the demon that lurked beneath the 
surface. But Anthy knew his true self. And knew his mind. King Akio may have quieted and 
retracted his claws for now, but that was only so his attack would be a silent one later.

Still...knowing that, she felt strength. Utena would be there. And Anthy felt that as long 
as she had the courageous otherworldly soldier at her side, nothing would harm her. Indeed, 
the memory of that firm body next to hers pushed fear and despair far from her mind. 
Leaving her lightweight and warm. What would Utena wear this evening? Would she forgo the 
armor and dress in courtly attire? That of a lady, in a fine gown? Surely not. Dios&#39; right 
hand, despite her very feminine features, held a masculine air. Much like the Lady Juri. So 
she would no doubt dress in clothing more suitable. Ahhh...she could hardly wait! Given 
recent events, perhaps she could sit nearer to her. Be asked for a dance? At the very least 
stand with her beloved protector. Anthy blushed slightly and placed a hand gently on her 
chest, where her heart was beating a bit faster. And perhaps after...they could...

&quot;Anthy my dear, what thoughts have you so far from here?&quot; Anthy jerked to the present and 
turned to face the door with a whirl, her hair swishing behind her against the chair&#39;s 
back. There was Touga, leaning against the frame. Looking the very portrait of coy 
elegance. He was watching her with a small smile on his lips, clearly amused to have caught 
her daydreaming. Schooling her features Anthy greeted him with a polite nod.

&quot;Nothing but the festivities planned for tonight. You are looking well, as always, my 
lord.&quot;

Touga entered the room, his foot falls nearly silent on the plush carpet. His hair flowed 
over his shoulders like water, rich and luxuriant and the color of rose petals. One whose 
thorns were hidden carefully from view by its own beauty. It&#39;s own intoxicating scent.

&quot;Is that so? Thank you for your kind words, Princess. And may I say you look absolutely 
ravishing...I&#39;m certain you will be the delight of the ball this evening.&quot; He regarded her 
stonily silent attendants for a moment, arching an eyebrow. &quot;But what say you and I have a 
private planning session, hmn? Coordinate our attire and pick out matching accessories.&quot; 
With a dismissive wave, and a toss of his head, Touga sent the handmaidens away. They 
departed in a flurry of bows and rustling dresses. Like brown autumn birds startled into 
flight, Anthy noted distantly. They didn&#39;t even look to her for her approval or 
acquiescence, which was a breech of protocol and politeness that was a punishable offense. 
Though she held the rank of Princess in Ohtori once more, Anthy was once again reminded in 
this small display that she was merely regarded as a distasteful figure head. And nothing 
more.

&quot;Amazing is it not? How so much can change in so little time. Yet some things do not change 
at all.&quot; Touga spoke from just behind her seated form, causing her shoulders to tense. He 
placed a hand on the edge of the chair&#39;s ornate back as he leaned forward. His body 
stretching over and past her as he picked up a small brush. Left over from the makeup pot 
that had been used to give her lips a richer tone. He twirled it lazily between his 
fingers, Anthy&#39;s green eyes watching him from the reflection of the glass. His blue eyes 
met hers with another smile.

&quot;For instance...&quot; The brush spun in tiny neat arcs, twirling between pale tapered fingers. 
&quot;Your obvious rise to status again. And allegiance with the Guardian of the Mount. Dios&#39; 
own messenger. A most advantageous windfall that has done much to return to you 
your...color.&quot; The spinning brush stopped. And as Anthy watched, her expression guarded, 
Touga balanced it carefully across the underside of one finger. Bobbing the small tool 
lightly up and down, making it appear as if it were bending. She didn&#39;t move. Her 
expression blank and mood wary as she ignored the childish optical illusion.

Touga beamed at her from the mirror, his eyes twinkling charmingly. &quot;You&#39;re healthier 
certainly. More lively and lovely. I never did like seeing you in rags, m&#39;lady. And was 
never one to endorse the more...darker aspects of your servitude.&quot; His good humor never 
left, but Anthy frowned then. Her guard tightening as she looked away. Reminded of her 
not-so-distant past. And the abuse and humiliation that had made up her world. With 
careless ease, Touga broke through the sunny feelings Anthy had had, like an approaching 
thunderstorm. &quot;Passed around...little more than a plaything for anyone who currently had 
your leash. No, you are far more suited to grand dresses and regal balls! A delicate and 
beautiful vision, free of such torment.&quot;

A heavy and too-warm hand on her shoulder brought back her attention to where he was 
looking down into her face from above her. He held her gaze, smile never faltering. Then 
the forgotten brush in his hands suddenly dipped down to sweep a line across her bottom 
lip. Hitching her breath in surprise. Glaring, Anthy reared back from his hand in a sudden 
flash of anger. Swiping her thumb to remove the ticklish lingering feeling. &quot;And yet my 
lord Kiryuu, you see fit to remind me of such things. Is that why you&#39;ve come? To dredge up 
old history and old shame?&quot;

Touga pursed his lips, looking hurt as he placed a hand on his chest. &quot;Surely not, Princess 
Anthy. I&#39;m no cad, come to enter your private apartments and torment you. That was always 
the favored method of our dear Kyouichi general was it not? Ah. Forgive my offense...I see 
I&#39;ve upset you.&quot; He took a step away from her, turning his back as he took in her room. 
Noting the scattering of feminine decoration. When he turned back, his expression was 
serious. &quot;My apologies, your majesty. For what is past is past. Though perhaps not so 
easily forgotten...surely though, the Council is evolving and changing as you yourself are. 
As this kingdom is.&quot;

Anthy stood and strode to the far dresser, tone cool. &quot;What did you come here for, Lord 
Kiryuu?&quot;

Touga moved to the edge of her bed, taking a seat on it and crossing his legs at the knee. 
When she turned and scowled, he raised an eyebrow but did not move. Anthy sighed and 
arranged, then re-arranged, a vase of flowers on her bedside table.

&quot;I come to talk of many things Anthy. But since you are in ill-tempers, I shall narrow the 
field of our conversation. I come, not on behalf of the King or the Council...but myself. 
And in regards to the Guardian specifically. I&#39;m worried about you Anthy.&quot; Touga casually 
discarded formality like a worn glove, as if rendering them close. And were they not? Could 
you repeatedly give your body to another and not be close in some way? The old turmoil that 
twisted in Anthy&#39;s middle began to writhe again. A feeling of danger. But she struggled to 
keep her voice even.

&quot;And what is it that concerns you? The Guardian is awake and appears to be in fine form. A 
blessing for us all, is it not?&quot;

Touga&#39;s lips quirked in a knowing smirk. &quot;Mmm, fine form indeed. Certainly for a particular 
Princess and her fickle emotions, yes.&quot;

Green eyes flashed in warning. &quot;Watch your words, my lord.&quot; Anthy&#39;s spine went rigid. 
Tense.

Blue eyes hardened and smirk widened. &quot;I speak only truth, my princess. Truth that any fool 
can see. I spoke of changes earlier, dear. Yours. I knew a time when your feelings were 
absent and hidden from casual view. A time when you were a willing partner to whomever your 
royal brother placed before you, heart like stone and temperament as formless as fog. But 
now? You wear your love-sick heart on your sleeve. And people are beginning to talk, fair 
Anthy.&quot; And just like that, Touga&#39;s sweet tone turned frigid. He rose, stalking toward her 
like a graceful predator. Causing the princess to back into the dresser and raise her hands 
to ward him off. He took one hand and bent at the waist to place a kiss on the back of her 
hand. Suddenly playing the gentleman again.

&quot;The Guardian...you aim high Anthy. But like the story of the boy who wished to fly, you 
soar too close to the sun. Your feathers are only held together with wax, love. And that 
wax already melts. You&#39;re coming apart at the seams...&quot;

Anthy gasped as Touga&#39;s hands found their way to the small of her back. Encircling her in 
his arms. Loosely holding her to him as he looked down at her consideringly. His hair 
forming a curtain about them both as his eyes tracked the sway of her earrings. Anthy made 
to push him back weakly. Mentally berating herself for allowing him this close. For not 
sending him from the room the moment he appeared. She should call for her servants. The 
guard stationed outside. Even Utena, not simply stand there like a stupid lamb. Waiting for 
the wolf to bite. Anthy willed herself to move. To speak. Her lips parted but no sound came 
out as she trembled slightly. She needed to...do something...stop from going wherever his 
true intentions lay!

But years of compliance caused the words to die, weakened the muscles of her arms. She 
tried to force herself to be firm, to be rigid and unyielding. But she couldn&#39;t seem to do 
anything other than stand there and be held. Why? Move you stupid sow...you&#39;re not that 
kind of...o-of slave anymore! Anthy felt her chin lifted delicately with a finger. And like 
a puppet she moved with the motions as a part of her began to die.

&quot;Anthy...what do you hope to gain? What sort of future do you honestly see for the two of 
you? I know you better than most, my starling. My lovely witch princess...&quot; He placed a 
chaste kiss on her forehead, expression changing to bemusement. Anthy felt a memory rise, 
of a wet blood seal that had been stamped onto her forehead back at the mountain shrine. Of 
her brother&#39;s lips kissing that same spot fondly, once upon a time...

&quot;You seek her affection. Crave it, as you craved affection in the past. But what do you 
truly know of our holy lady knight?&quot;

Anthy found her voice at this, and a measure of strength came to her. &quot;My feelings, for 
once, are not completely unrequited. Even if they do not match my intensity, Touga...she 
has not yet left my side. Utena, our holy protector, has seen fit to share with me personal 
history, her thoughts. Can anyone else claim the same? Even those on the Council? I trust 
her, Touga. And I care for her deeply. With reverence due a deity. And with the feelings of 
a woman.&quot; She turned slightly smug at this, noting his slight frown. Touga was one of the 
few who she could be completely honest with. For he knew her darkness, and was past the 
boredom on judging her for it.

They had spent years growing together, and she remembered a time when he wasn&#39;t always so 
confident. So self-assured. But more importantly Touga knew that they both knew he reported 
directly to the king. Was his lapdog and confidant. And still she told him, knowing whose 
ear the words would reach. It was almost a game between them. Between Anthy and Akio, with 
Touga acting as their mouthpiece.

But she was surprised as Touga started chuckling. The arms holding her loosened, as his 
belly shook in laughter. A hand coming up to cover his eyes as they closed in amusement. 
Anthy frowned again, confused.

&quot;Oh Anthy...how precious. You know? For a moment I truly did believe your affected naivety. 
But we both know you better than that, princess.&quot; his hand fell away, and his eyes locked 
with hers. A darker shadow seeming to swirl within them. Pinning her with an arrogant 
stare.

&quot;She&#39;s shared &#39;history&#39; with you, has she? Confided in you? Returned some of your feelings? 
Come come now Anthy, let&#39;s dispense with the foolishness and be honest. Shall we?&quot; His tone 
dripped with a sweetness that was pure poison.

Anthy&#39;s jaw tightened, &quot;Yes. She has.&quot;

&quot;...I find that hard to believe.&quot; Touga rocked back on a heel and gestured in the air. His 
hand making lazy sinister patterns. &quot;So you know a bit about her. Know what little she&#39;s 
told you. But one must ask one&#39;s self...how much isn&#39;t she telling you.&quot;

Anthy bit her lip and looked away. &quot;We&#39;re all entitled to our secrets, Touga. It&#39;s not my 
place to pry.&quot;

Touga gave her a knowing look. &quot;Yes. Secrets. You&#39;d know best about that, wouldn&#39;t you. How 
much have you told her, Anthy? How much does our dear Utena-&quot;

&quot;Do not speak her name so familiarly!&quot;

&quot;-Utena know about the real you? About your past? Your failure? Your curse? Did you share 
all of the lovely tidbits concerning your brother?&quot;

&quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;About how you threw away your dignity for pure selfishness?&quot;

&quot;I said stop it!&quot;

&quot;About what really is going on in the mind of our adulterer, newly restored princess, and 
her conniving machinations to coerce a deity yet again?&quot;

&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Anthy&#39;s shrill voice cut the air like a knife, effectively silencing her 
conscience and the red-haired man. For a moment, Touga fixed her with a disgusted look. But 
in a flash the look was gone, hidden beneath the surface of a coy smile.

&quot;Well. There&#39;s no need to shout.&quot;

&quot;Get out. I want you out, Touga Kiryuu. Leave!&quot; She gave him a rough shove, as he spread 
his hands wide. Looking hurt and confused by her sudden loss of control.

&quot;Well certainly...if that is the way you feel. I&#39;m only concerned about your well-being, 
Princess Anthy.&quot; He moved toward the door, but turned back on his shoulder as he tapped his 
chin. Making a show of coming to a thought. &quot;Before I leave though...a suggestion, my 
lady.&quot;

Anthy moved to her chair once more, back rigid in simmering anger and embarrassment. &quot;What, 
Lord Kiryuu.&quot;

Touga smirked. &quot;If your bond is as strong as you intimate...then surely you have knowledge 
of the noble lady&#39;s past love. And would have no trouble asking her about how she got that 
vicious scar across her back.&quot;

Anthy gave a start, eyes wide as she twisted in her chair. &quot;How is it you-?&quot;

&quot;I have my ways. Getting to what lies beneath a lady&#39;s clothing is surely a talent I&#39;ve 
shown more than once, Anthy darling.&quot;

Anthy spat angrily, her hands tightly clenched into fists. &quot;Yes. I know of her past love 
for Dios. Her scar came no doubt from the holy war in heaven, during her time when she was 
in service to him.&quot;

Touga gave a soft clap of his hands, as if praising a child. &quot;Very good! Clever clever 
girl. Your details are a bit vague...but it&#39;s really not my place to fill them in. Of that 
special time for our holy knight.&quot; He smirked at Anthy&#39;s obvious irritation and desire for 
him to leave. &quot;Then you are fully aware no doubt that Utena&#39;s service to him went beyond 
the heart and body and soul. That she has with him a...what&#39;s the phrase your people use? A 
miur de la ahtlahk?&quot; Anthy&#39;s fists unclenched as her brow furrowed in confusion. He started 
to pass through the door way, speaking over his shoulder. &quot;Hard to get over something like 
that, after dying for the one you love.&quot;

&quot;Wait. What are you-?&quot;

But the door closed with his cryptic statement and Touga was gone. Leaving Anthy to sit 
there, trapped in a noose of self-doubt and worry. A miur de la ahtlahk? That was a phrase 
she hadn&#39;t heard spoken since...goodness, since she was a child. Since she&#39;d lost her 
village and her people, and left with her brother to travel the countryside. It meant 
something to the effect of...a bond of the inner being. One born through a great enduring 
and one that tied like a two-way rope. A bond of not the heart or the soul, but a destiny. 
A love and a closeness that went beyond words and that without one of the two, the other 
died. Meaning it was not a term used easily, and it was taken from the word miurae which 
was a type of knot climbers tied to prevent other knots and the loose end from untying. 
There wasn&#39;t a term for it in the common language she now spoke. But distantly it meant a 
sort of...of...

&quot;Never-ending devotion...an inescapable love.&quot; Anthy whispered, and felt her heart lurch. 
All of a sudden she felt her throat close as a wave of dizziness passed over her. Leaning 
down she placed a hand to her breast similar to what Touga had done earlier. Steading 
herself as she leaned onto the chair and vanity. What was she doing? This was foolish. 
Utena...Utena cared for her. She did, she said as much. Touga was merely trying to drive a 
wedge between them. Acting on behalf of the king. Make her doubt her protector.

Well no matter, she wouldn&#39;t listen. Tonight she would meet Utena at the ball. Anthty brave 
the glittering throng and the golden cruel courtiers to spend time with her and muster the 
courage to ask for a dance. And perhaps afterward they could steal away somewhere and she 
could...be by her side. Share some of her own past in the hopes Utena would continue to 
open up to her. They cared for each other. So why did it feel like the world was about to 
slip away from under her feet?

Sadly she tapped the handle of the hairbrush that rested on the vanity. How did Utena get 
that scar? That horrible scar that looked to have been fatal? Did it matter so very much, 
or was she just being paranoid? Her reflection looking lost in more than just thought as 
her eyes squeezed shut to close out the whispers that tugged at her crumbling confidence...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Utena had clanked down the corridors searching for a certain maid with a bouncing ponytail. 
But had come up empty-handed. Wakaba was nowhere to be found, and asking the other servants 
only brought furtive gazes and noncommittal answers. Either they were too shy to speak, or 
they didn&#39;t wish to tell Utena what she feared to be true. That Wakaba was either avoiding 
her, or had left because of her. Both thoughts which caused her shoulders to droop from 
within her armor. Her visor was down, and few dared look up into the frightening faceplate 
with its glowing eyes. So she stood untroubled at a window in the eastern corridor of the 
castle, lost in her inner thoughts. Perhaps it was best this way...she was a killer and now 
becoming embroiled in an unseen plot. Wakaba was safer being far away from her. And her odd 
emotional response was no doubt due to recent damage and trauma. Her body and mind would 
soon be healed and such weakness would be...

But her own forced assertions died away as she sighed. Who was she trying to fool? Though 
she&#39;d not admit it out loud she often felt...lonely. Detached from everything around her. 
This wasn&#39;t her world. Nor were these truly her people. Gone was her city and her brothers 
in arms. Gone was Dios and the complex that had been her home since birth. She was out of 
place and living a lie. Doing little more than follow a directive for orders that no longer 
mattered. Protect the king? From what? And why? What did it matter? If she so chose, she 
could single-handedly raze a path of destruction across the countryside, nearly 
indestructible to their primitive weapons and technology. It was all foolishness...and 
there! Even her own mind was not her own. She spoke and acted differently from what she 
remembered...not by much, but enough to bother her.

Utena sighed again and rubbed at her neck plate, metal gauntlets scrapping softly as she 
unconsciously sought her neck in habit. Her memories were dimming too...but she still 
recalled that promise. That now broken promise, the one that forced her to obey whether she 
wanted to or not. She treasured Anthy, the young woman who&#39;s pitiable situation had forced 
her hand early on. But who managed to shine with her own kind of light. Saionji was 
irritating and a pig, but his stoic dedication to the sword and his adopted people 
resonated with her. Juri was an enigma and seductive...Touga a cad and a fop. Brainless and 
preening. Miki and his sister were interesting in their own way...and the king in his wife 
were...nobility. With the negative and reservations that title held for politicians in 
Utena&#39;s book. But they all treated her differently in some way. Either deference or with 
some hidden intention. Wakaba had been different. She&#39;d been more real in some way. More 
like a true friend, to not just Anthy but in that brief time to Utena herself. She&#39;d been 
able to relax a part of herself that she couldn&#39;t seem to with anyone but Anthy. Without 
that awkward mess of emotions clouding things.

A bird twittered outside from its nest in the castle stone. A long winding procession of 
nobles and their entourages were making their way one at a time through the castle check 
point. Being ushered to various places by bowing and scraping figures below. To her they 
seemed like insects. Not just from her vantage point, but from their movements and silly 
skittering about. The sun was sinking down into the horizon and was bathing everything in a 
warm orange glow. But she didn&#39;t need it to gauge that she had little time to dress and get 
ready, her inner clock did that well enough. Mentally beeping at her to leave and change. 
Something she&#39;d been putting off since her hunt for the absent servant girl. The royal ball 
was a formality Utena would undergo, but not something she actually looked forward to. And 
Utena planned to leave as soon as possible...

&quot;You know Holy Guardian, if you keep sighing like that you&#39;ll deflate and blow away in the 
wind.&quot; Utena turned her head in surprise to find Wakaba standing there with a smile and her 
hands on her hips. The maid&#39;s brown dress was slightly smudge in ash and cobwebs, and her 
ponytail in a bit of disarray. Seeing the demonic visor, Wakaba flinched slightly and 
tutted with a wagging finger.

&quot;What on earth are you doing wearing that fearsome thing indoors? I thought we had moved 
past this, Lady Utena. Goodness gracious, you&#39;re not planning to actually wear that to the 
ball,are you?&quot;

Utena straightened and smiled behind her mask. The smile leaking into her voice as she 
politely inclined her head in private gratitude. &quot;Apologies, Lady Shinohara. I had 
considered it. I find it comfortable and in good sense should we be attacked during the 
festivities.&quot;

Wakaba swiped the air with her dust rag as she threw up her hands in exasperation. &quot;Have 
you ever heard such a thing before!&quot; Seeming to ask the sky. &quot;That is what we have guards 
for, Lady Utena. So you don&#39;t have to lumber around like a tin giant and frighten the 
guests. What on earth will they think when they see you?&quot; She started walking down the 
hall, heading in the direction of where Utena knew her room was situated. Apparently taking 
the matter into her own hands and going to pick out something proper.

Utena began to follow her, glad that things were seemingly fine between them. With no bad 
air or ill feelings. It eased her greatly, that her fears seemed to have been misplaced. As 
she thought about it, she hadn&#39;t seen Wakaba really since that night they&#39;d returned from 
the decrepit t.v. station underground. The &#39;shrine&#39; Anthy had been exploring. Utena pursed 
her lips. It was really fortunate actually she was here chattering so easily. She could 
have been hurt during the Black Rose attack, as so many others were. Utena opened her mouth 
to say as much.

&quot;It is good to see you are alright. I worried you might have been hurt during the attack on 
the castle.&quot; Utena commented lightly, glancing at a tapestry on the wall as she passed. She 
halted suddenly as Wakaba came to an abrupt stop and turned to regard her with a queer 
look.

&quot;What...do you mean, Guardian?&quot; Her smile was still in place. But something in her tone 
seemed off. Utena cocked her armored head to the side quizzically.

&quot;The Black Rose assault? It was chaos everywhere, and many of the castle staff were hurt 
during the onslaught. I&#39;m am glad you are in good health.&quot;

Wakaba gave a laugh and continued walking. &quot;Ah! Of course, forgive me. Yes, I heard it was 
terrible indeed, some of my fellow maids had to be treated. Fortunately I was away at the 
time, visiting family.&quot;

Oh? &quot;Is that so?&quot; Utena inquired, curious.

&quot;Yes. I had leave to visit them in the countryside for the day.&quot; Wakaba replied not 
turning. Nor elaborating further. Utena shrugged.

&quot;Regardless, I had missed seeing you around. I...wondered if the...incident at the shrine 
had given you cause to rethink your association with me.&quot; Utena haltingly admitted as they 
reached her door. Unable to help herself. Wakaba turned, and her expression became 
concerned as she looked up searchingly into the eye holes of Utena&#39;s metal mask.

&quot;My Lady...those bandits&#39; end was a violent thing. But you did it to protect us. You have 
always protected us, even before you walked freely about. I wouldn&#39;t be such a coward as to 
leave after something small like that.&quot; She scoffed and waved a hand in the air 
dismissively.

Utena opened the door and began to enter. &quot;You would be wise to. I&#39;m a danger and bring 
trouble about me. It&#39;s my nature.&quot;

She was stopped by a surprisingly strong hand on her elbow. She turned and Wakaba looked at 
her seriously. Her voice soft and sure. &quot;You don&#39;t bring trouble, Lady Utena. You bring 
hope. And I would never leave you.&quot; Then she smirked and swayed her hips as she flounced 
into the room first. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re stuck with me~!&quot;

Utena smirked, removing her helm. She closed the door behind her as Wakaba began flinging 
skirts and dresses and female attire through the air as she hunted through the wardrobe to 
find a pair of decent pants. A crumpled pair of bloomers sailed through the air to flop 
onto Utena&#39;s passive helm. Heaving another sigh, she removed tugged them off.

&quot;There are worse fates I suppose.&quot;

Akio was standing over a table in his room pouring over maps and documents as he wrote with 
a free hand. The queen came to his side and rubbed his arm affectionately, looking on him 
with soft eyes. Saying nothing he looked up as well, smiled, and took her hand in his to 
give it a kiss. The door opened as Miki came into the room, looking as haggard as he 
usually did. Circles under his eyes and his blue hair tousled. He bowed hastily as he 
entered. Blinking owlishly in the light. &quot;Your majesties, you wished to see me?&quot;

Akio nodded and gestured for the young man to sit on an offered chair, the Queen presenting 
a warm smile. &quot;You seem tired, Seiron Miki. Is my husband keeping you up late with more of 
his experiments?&quot; Miki looked up and hastily waved his hands with a tight smile.

&quot;Oh no not at all. I&#39;m afraid it is my own insatiable curiosity that has me pouring over 
old books into the wee hours. I find my brain has a mind of its own when it comes to 
learning something new.&quot; He and the queen laughed at the small joke as Akio shook his head 
with a warm smile.

&quot;But my dear queen is right. You do seem worn, Miki. And so I had thought to encourage you 
to take a break and attend the ball this evening. Your sister had mentioned you had planned 
to miss it in favor of your studies?&quot; Miki rubbed a hand over his arm, looking guilty. &quot;But 
as a member of my council and a dear friend...I would be most pleased if you could attend. 
Your lab will be waiting for you when it is over. And I know your sister would be thrilled 
to have you escort her. A fine young lady she is.&quot;

Miki looked up, as his brow creased in unspoken thoughts. But he dutifully gave a nod and 
another tired smile. &quot;Of course your majesty. You are right of course...I could use some 
time away I suppose.&quot;

Akio came over and clapped him on the shoulder with a cheerful chuckle. Miki wobbled 
slightly in his chair from the motion. &quot;Excellent! In that case I&#39;ll send word. I look 
forward to seeing you this evening, Seiron Miki.&quot;

Taking his dismissal, the Kaoru twin stood and gave a bow as he departed. The queen moved 
to the other side of the room and disappeared into the private bath as she rang a servant. 
When she was gone, Akio moved to one wall and gave a small rap of his knuckles. The wall 
slid sideways a sliver, revealing a man crouched there awaiting the king&#39;s orders.

&quot;The mage will be gone from the lower levels this evening. Use this time to move the crates 
out of the storage cavern and into the vaults. Make certain you and your men are not seen. 
You have my permission to silence those that get in your way, but do not strike against my 
chosen. Take this, it will gain you access. Be sure to accommodate the researchers any way 
you can. I must have the machine finished as soon as possible. Before our dear Guardian has 
a chance to catch our scent. Now go.&quot;

The dark clad man gave a nod and departed, taking a small black box from the king and 
closing the wall behind him. The king turned back toward the room and regarded the table 
covered in maps.

&quot;Holiness comes only to those deserving.&quot; he recited as his lips curved into a wicked grin. 
Tonight was a night of opportunity.
