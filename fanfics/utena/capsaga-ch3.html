<h1>The Capital Saga (part 3 of 7)</h1>

<a href="../utena/capsaga-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>      Vaun shifted uncomfortably, his rest troubled in the deep 
shadows before the dawn. The dark haired boy moaned softly, unaware 
of the man who sat there by the bed, and the black rose that lay 
beside his face, shimmering oddly in the darkness.

      &quot;This Utena should not be here,&quot; Mikage murmured to Vaun 
softly, &quot;she&#39;s taken the place that should have been Nanami&#39;s, 
hasn&#39;t she?&quot;

      Vaun whimpered softly in his sleep, twisting on the rough 
mattress.

      &quot;You must stand up for her,&quot; Mikage said to him firmly, &quot;you 
must undo this great disservice.&quot; A cold smile, &quot;You must punish 
Anthy for allowing it...&quot;

      With a soft gasp Vaun came awake, looking all about him in 
confusion. &quot;What was that all about?&quot; he murmured to himself softly. 
He dressed quite swiftly, pulling his uniform on quickly and 
efficiently. Without thinking about it too much he picked up the 
black rose from off his desk, and then tucked it into his uniform 
pocket.

      The dawn was breaking, and Utena smiled softly, cradling 
Anthy in her arms. The beautiful woman stirred, and with a gentle 
smile Utena said, &quot;Good morning.&quot;

      &quot;Good morning,&quot; Anthy smiled happily, kissing her softly.

      The two women dressed got dressed swiftly, then headed out 
to go get some breakfast. As they walled the white stone hallways 
Utena noticed banners and garlands being raised, and busy 
preparations going on all around them.

      &quot;Is all of this for your coronation as Queen?&quot; Utena asked 
Anthy softly.

      &quot;Hmm,&quot; Anthy nodded slightly, &quot;Miki has been busy, I see. 
The coronation should be in about a week from my arrival here, by 
ancient custom.&quot;

      &quot;Anything I can do?&quot; Utena looked at her worriedly.

      Anthy put her hand on Utena&#39;s arm and smiled wryly, &quot;With 
all the craziness that will be involved in the next few days, just 
be ready to catch me if I collapse.&quot;

      &quot;That bad?&quot; Utena blinked.

      Anthy smiled grimly as a small mob of courtiers came up the 
hallway, waving pieces of parchment and babbling constantly even as 
Utena tried to shield Anthy. The princess gave Utena a mild shrug 
before saying, &quot;See what I mean?&quot;

      In another part of the great palace Shiori stood atop one of 
the outer walls, the purple haired girl&#39;s eyes closed. A rippling 
began all around her, her clothes shifting with an unseen breeze and 
a soft glow shining from deep within her. It grew brighter and 
brighter, her lips slightly moving, until with a final word the 
light faded away.

      &quot;Incredible,&quot; Nanami noted, standing beside Juri not too far 
away. Dressed in her standard uniform the slightly shorter blonde 
looked crisply capable, clean and well pressed.

      Juri smirked slightly, &quot;You have no idea.&quot;

      Nanami blinked, then colored slightly as she got what Juri 
meant. &quot;Trying to live up to your reputation, lady-killer?&quot; she 
asked. 

      Juri didn&#39;t answer Nanami for a few moments as she looked up 
at Shiori, love clearly visible in her eyes. &quot;Not any more,&quot; she 
murmured.

      Shiori started to climb down, her mage&#39;s robes fluttering 
around her. Juri reached up to brace the smaller woman to guide her 
down and Shiori smiled, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

      &quot;Any luck?&quot; Nanami asked politely. She and Juri were both 
equal in rank, theoretically, so they were being very cautious 
around each other, avoiding stepping on each other&#39;s toes. 
Considering the bad start they had all gotten off on, it seemed a 
very good idea.

      &quot;Just traces,&quot; Shiori answered, &quot;this place is so much 
larger than the Princess&#39; Castle in the west that it takes much 
longer to fully search it.&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t press yourself too hard,&quot; Juri cautioned her softly 
as the tall, orange haired woman put her arm over the smaller 
woman&#39;s shoulders.

      &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Shiori smiled up at her gently.

      &quot;Just watch your back,&quot; Nanami softly cautioned her, &quot;I 
still have my suspicions about the death of the last Court mage.&quot;

      Juri gave a cool little smile as she said, &quot;Anything that 
wishes to harm Shiori will have to come through me first.&quot;

      Nanami felt a slight pang, remembering someone whom she had 
felt something similar to that, so long ago...

      The young man strode by them, dark hair flowing around his 
face, his eyes intend. A slight nod to Nanami, &quot;Good morning, 
commander.&quot;

      &quot;Vaun,&quot; Nanami blinked as he walked on swiftly.

      &quot;What on earth?&quot; Shiori murmured, her eyes narrowing.

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Juri asked.

      The purple haired sorceress had an odd look on her 
face, &quot;There&#39;s some kind of enchantment on him. I&#39;m not sure what it 
does, but I think we should follow him.&quot;

      Sitting in the Princess&#39; receiving room Utena and Anthy were 
taking a well deserved break. &quot;Should I send Wakaba to go get some 
tea?&quot; Utena asked her softly.

      &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Anthy smiled up at her happily.

      There was a loud hammering on the door, and Utena tensed as 
she looked up worriedly. A kick hammered them open, and Vaun stood 
there, his dark hair wild around his face. Dressed in his usual 
uniform his dark eyes were glazed, and a black rose was in the 
breast pocket.

      &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Utena demanded.

      &quot;I challenge you, Tenjou Utena,&quot; Vaun said grimly. He 
swiftly drew his short sword, running across the room towards the 
two of them.

      &quot;Get behind me,&quot; Utena shoved Anthy backwards onehandedly 
even as she drew her own sword. &#39;Wish I had Dios with me right now,&#39; 
she thought grimly as the swords met with a clang of steel on steel. 
With a mighty heave of her slim shoulders she forced him back even 
as she demanded, &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;

      &quot;For honor,&quot; Vaun&#39;s swing nearly took Utena&#39;s head off.

      &quot;Utena!&quot; Anthy cried out in alarm.

      Utena swiftly kicked chairs and plush couches aside, making 
some room to move. She watched him cautiously, waiting on the balls 
of her feet for him to move. &#39;He looks dazed,&#39; Utena parried 
smoothly, &#39;almost confused. More sorcery, maybe?&#39;

      &quot;Yield,&quot; Utena struck against his guard, knowing that this 
boy was strong.

      &quot;Never,&quot; Vaun bit out.

      &quot;Vaun!&quot; Nanami cried out in surprise, standing there in the 
receiving room&#39;s doorway, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

      &quot;This usurper will pay for what she&#39;s done,&quot; Vaun scowled.

      &quot;Magic,&quot; Shiori scowled. Now she knew where she had felt 
this before, when they had faced the entranced soldiers out in the 
field. She narrowed her eyes, and tried to feel the magics swirling 
around the boy, then her eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Strike for the 
rose!&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say,&quot; Utena muttered, hammering at 
his guard. Using a trick her old swordmistress Tarma had taught her 
Utena slipped her blade under his, forcing it upwards smoothly. A 
single swing, and petals of the black rose scattered on the floor.

      Vaun stood there frozen for a few moments, his handsome face 
oddly blank. Then he just limply collapsed, almost like a puppet 
who&#39;s strings had been cut, his sword clattering loudly in the 
stunned quiet of the room as it fell to the ground..

      Nanami gazed down in shock at her trusted second in 
command, &quot;I don&#39;t understand what could have made him attack you, 
Captain.&quot;

      &quot;It wasn&#39;t his fault,&quot; Shiori said firmly, &quot;he was being 
controlled.&quot;

      &quot;Looks like our enemy has reared his head once again,&quot; Juri 
frowned.

      The room was plunged in shadow, the standing figure raising 
a black rose to his face. &quot;The first test was successful,&quot; Mikage 
murmured.

      There was utter silence in the room, another figure laying 
there on the bed. His face was expressionless, but strangely 
beautiful, too. Mikage looked down at him, his eyes dark as he 
stroked the boy across the cheek.

      &quot;Now I just need to find someone... closer, to them,&quot; Mikage 
smiled, a cold, cruel smile.
