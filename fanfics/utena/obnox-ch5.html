<a href="../utena/obnox-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m going totally insane,&quot; Kozue sighed to herself softly, laying 
back on the small single bed. Her arms were folded behind her head, 
unconsciously pushing her breasts up higher. She closed her eyes, 
flopping one of her arms across them to block out the morning sun.

&#39;I haven&#39;t got laid in weeks,&#39; she thought to herself despairingly, 
&#39;and it doesn&#39;t look like the dry spell will be ending anytime soon.&#39;

Lum stepped out of the other room, walking towards the bathroom in her 
usual tiger striped tiny bikini. &quot;Darling,&quot; she asked sweetly, &quot;is it 
all right if I shower first?&quot;

&quot;Sure, go ahead,&quot; Kozue sighed. &#39;There goes the source of my troubles, 
right there,&#39; she thought to herself mournfully.

Before she could continue, Lum stepped back out, nude, a towel draped 
over her shoulder. She seemed unashamed of her nudity, proud of her 
slim form, as she said softly, &quot;If you like, you can come wash my back 
for me.&quot;

Kozue started, realizing that she&#39;d been staring at her for quite a 
while as she stammered out, &quot;No, no, you just go on ahead.&quot; Lum gave 
her a cute little pout before finally going back into safety of the 
little bathroom.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how much longer I can take this,&quot; Kozue said 
despairingly.

Kozue sat in class, trying to ignore the looks she was getting. Lum 
sat on top of her desk, smiling at Kozue and ignoring the teacher as 
well as their fellow classmates.

Kozue had to crane her neck a bit to look around Lum&#39;s pert breasts as 
she tried to see the blackboard. She didn&#39;t dare look at any other 
students, as she knew what would likely happen: the madly jealous Lum 
would zap them.

Every attempt at a date over the past few weeks had been totally 
scared away. The girls didn&#39;t even dare try approach her, as Lum was 
an equal opportunity zapper, too. One time she had actually managed to 
get a sort of cute boy in her bedroom and Lum out of there for a 
while. Things were progressing quite nicely for them, they were both 
naked, in the bed, he was just about to enter her when... Lum decided 
to come back home early. She stopped cold there in the doorway, and 
Kozue and him both froze, waiting to see what she&#39;d do.

The poor boy&#39;s screams of pain and terror could be heard throughout 
the dorm, and it was the talk of the school for the next day and 
several afterward. The good news was, it looked like his pubic hair 
would, eventually, grow back.

They had gotten a official letter the day after, moving them both into 
the east dorm, signed by the Dean of Students, Akio, himself. She 
understood the reasoning, putting them in the nearly deserted dorm 
might cut down on the innocent bystanders being hurt, not to mention 
the property damage, but it made their situation even stranger.

Every day, she had to watch the seemingly perfect couple, Utena and 
Anthy, together. It got quite sickening, honestly, how sweet they were 
to each other. And Lum was there, smiling sweetly and mostly 
unclothed, all the time.

Suddenly, she was jarred out of her thoughts by a loud bell, and saw 
students all getting up to leave. &#39;Class over already,&#39; she sighed, 
then noticed the teacher&#39;s wave.

&quot;I understand you&#39;re dealing with an unusual situation,&quot; he smiled, 
putting his hand on her shoulder, &quot;and I&#39;d like to help.&quot;

Before she could even try to warn him, Lum appeared behind him, 
obviously furious. &quot;Hands off my Darling!&quot; she roared, and cut loose.

Kozue looked down at the smoking, out cold teacher and sighed out, 
&quot;It&#39;s going to be a long term, I just know it.&quot; </pre>
