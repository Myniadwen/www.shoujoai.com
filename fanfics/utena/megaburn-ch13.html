<a href="../utena/megaburn-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Tuxedo Kamen smiled grimly, black hair falling into
his mask covered eyes as he tossed a rose, shattering
a mercenary&#39;s face plate. Swiftly he followed up,
hammering the armored figure with his cane until he
dropped.

&quot;How are we doing?&quot; Sailor Moon called as she scythed
out a energy bolt, dissolving armored suits to rose
petals and revealing stunned half naked men and women.
Her blonde hair glittered, staff gleaming as the
senshi scanned the battlefield.

The headquarters of Bioware was in flames, mercenaries
and AD Police forces battling it out in the streets.
The police were badly outgunned but fought on
valiantly even as the mercs cut them down... until the
Senshi arrived, of course. Now the tide was turning,
slowly but surely.

&quot;We seem to be doing pretty well,&quot; Sailor Mars
answered her, the raven haired woman leaping up
smoothly into the air. She cried out and gestured,
&quot;Mars Flame Sniper!&quot; then cut the legs out from under
a mercenary battlesuit.

Sailor Saturn struck gracefully with her polearm,
tearing through the enemy. &quot;I just wish I knew where
Sailor Venus disappeared to,&quot; she murmured, spinning
her weapon to cut down several of the incoming
missiles.

&quot;Dead Scream,&quot; Sailor Pluto murmured, a sphere of
destructive energy sweeping from the end of the black
haired woman&#39;s time staff to tear a mercenary
transport apart. &quot;We&#39;ll find out soon enough,&quot; she
said.

Working in two groups the Sailor Senshi were
demolishing the mercs, the outers on one side, the
inners on the other as they converged on the center of
the mercenary force, supporting the battered AD Police
officers.

From the side a voice loudly declared, &quot;May I have
your attention please!&quot; Everyone turned to see a group
of figures being herded out of the damaged Bioware
building. Several of the heads of the company were
being pushed out reluctantly by the human forms of
Luna and Artemis along with Sailor Venus. &quot;Surrender,&quot;
she called to the mercs, &quot;you can&#39;t save these men,
anyway.&quot;

One of the mercs raised his combat rifle, almost
looking like he was going to surrender.... then he
dropped it into firing position, spraying them with
firepower. Before Venus could react the executives
were cut down in a splash of red, only their
superhuman reflexes saving her, Luna and Artemis from
possibly suffering the same fate.

&quot;No!&quot; the sandy haired Sailor Uranus yelled in fury.
With a few words she sent her Worldshaking attack to
cut the assassin down, then the Senshi tore into the
enemy with a new drive. In only a few moments it was
finally over, the armored enemy subdued.

&quot;They killed their own employers,&quot; Mercury murmured,
barely feeling Mars&#39; comforting hand on her arm, &quot;what
are we dealing with?&quot;

&quot;Lets find out,&quot; Sailor Nepture nodded to Uranus.

Smoothly Uranus stalked over to one of the captured
mercs, casually ripping him out of his armor in a
startling show of strength. &quot;You just saw what I did
to your armor,&quot; she purred, eyes narrowed, &quot;Do you
want to see what I can do to you? Talk!&quot;

The black haired young man looked up at her in terror,
his brown eyes wide in fear. &quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; he started,
then blurted out, &quot;Kimura told me this would be a
crowd suppression job, not something like this!&quot;

&quot;Kimura?&quot; Neptune asked coldly.

&quot;He was our rep at Nergal... I don&#39;t know who he
reported to, though,&quot; he offered quickly. &quot;Supposedly
there&#39;s something under Megatokyo, they have to have
control of the city to get at it!&quot; He stammered,
adding, &quot;That&#39;s all I know.&quot;

&quot;You ever want a job at the AD Police just ask,&quot; one
female officer noted with a shy smile as they hauled
the mercs off, &quot;you got the intimidation down.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Uranus gave her a charming smile, enjoying
seeing the girl blush.

&quot;Come on, love,&quot; Neptune said with a sigh, firmly
grabbing Uranus by the arm and then dragging her away.

&quot;But I was just...&quot; Uranus started.

&quot;I know exactly what you were doing,&quot; Neptune gave her
a dangerous look, &quot;and you&#39;re going to pay for it
later.&quot;

&quot;If you two are done playing?&quot; Sailor Jupiter asked
them with a sigh, &quot;I think we&#39;ve got bigger problems
to deal with.&quot;

Tuxedo Kamen smiled slightly, &quot;I think we can all
guess what they&#39;re after?&quot;

&quot;The old NERV facilities beneath Megatokyo,&quot; Sailor
Moon agreed promptly, &quot;there might be technology left
there after General Misato Katsuragi sealed it up in
the 2020s.&quot;

&quot;So who is this Nergal?&quot; Venus asked, the blonde
raising an eyebrow questioningly.

&quot;A engineering company, mostly,&quot; Mercury replied her
promptly, &quot;but they have their fingers in a lot of
pies... ship construction, biotech, human resources
and exotic energy sources.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go pay Nergal a visit,&quot; Sailor Saturn
offered calmly, her violet eyes carrying a dangerous
twinkle in them.

&quot;No,&quot; Sailor Moon surprised them by saying, &quot;we need
to pass the information on to the AD Police
headquarters, first. If we don&#39;t coordinate all our
activities, we could just end up getting into each
others way.&quot;

&quot;Natsuna said she was going to AD Police
headquarters,&quot; Venus said approvingly as she drew out
a cellphone and dialed, &quot;she can....&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jupiter asked as Venus dialed another
number, her expression oddly blank.

&quot;Natsuna isn&#39;t answering,&quot; Venus said grimly, &quot;and the
AD Police emergency number is down.&quot; Before anyone
could say anything she was gone, bouncing up to the
rooftops then racing towards AD Police headquarters.

&quot;You don&#39;t think...?&quot; Mars asked as the group raced to
try to catch up to Venus, the streets below them
either strangely empty or filled with the rubble of
combat.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen answered grimly.

As they neared headquarters the sounds of combat grew
louder, as did the bitter scent of smoke. Scattered
around the building wrecked mercenary armors were
crumpled, but the front of the building was ruined,
bodies of officers laying in the wreckage.

They raced inside then up a nearby stairway to where
the sounds of combat continued. The halls of the upper
levels were filled with smoke, bodies of mercs and
police officers scattered around. They ran until they
reached the battle, mercs fighting to break through a
last defense of the building....

The mercs didn&#39;t know what hit them. The senshi were
like a band of furies, tearing into the mercenaries
with a passion different from the last battle. The
bodies of AD Police officers haunted them as they
attacked, calling for justice, and the senshi were
determined to deliver it.

Once the last enemy armor was reduced to rubble they
ran to the surviving officers, Venus in the lead.
&quot;What happened?&quot; Sailor Venus demanded even as her
eyes searched the faces of the frighteningly small
group of survivors.

&quot;They must have been watching us,&quot; the young man said
bitterly, &quot;they jammed communications then hit us
after we deployed troops to make arrests.&quot;

&quot;Where is Chief McNicol?&quot; Sailor Moon asked, despite
what her instincts were telling her happened to him.

&quot;Dead,&quot; another woman spoke up grimly, &quot;he and the
last of the K suits attempted to hold off the mercs
several levels below.&quot;

Venus couldn&#39;t hold herself back, &quot;Has anyone seen a
older, redheaded civilian? I&#39;m almost certain she was
here when this attack started....&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s who I think it is,&quot; he said tentatively,
blonde hair falling into his eyes, &quot;she picked up a
rifle and was helping with the defense below.&quot;

Venus turned and was gone, racing back down stairs to
where they had passed several fallen AD Police armors.
She hesitated, then began to dig through the wreckage
to gently lay the fallen officers aside, looking for a
certain familiar face. Leon McNicol looked peaceful
when she found his body, the grown haired officer
trying to shield someone with his body....

&quot;Natsuna,&quot; Venus breathed out.

With shaking hands Venus felt desperately for a pulse,
but she knew it was a waste of time. Someone with
these bullet wounds, the blood lost around her...
there was nothing that they could do. Unaware that the
other senshi had come Venus simply held Natsuna close
to her and cried.</pre>
