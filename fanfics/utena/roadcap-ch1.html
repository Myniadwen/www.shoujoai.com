<h1>The Road to the Capital (part 1 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It only took two days for them to get ready to go, a remarkable 
achievement to be honest. Two lady&#39;s carriages, wagons of belongings, 
outriders, soldiers and Anthy&#39;s loyal companions, all sorted out and 
organized by poor Miki. But now they were gathered in the courtyard of 
the western palace, ready to move out.

Anthy paused, looking around at her favorite home, before Utena helped 
her into her carriage. Anthy smiled at her gently, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Utena smiled.

Wakaba fought back a smirk, sitting down opposite her lady. She had 
been chosen to be Anthy&#39;s personal maid, and she would be accompanying 
them to the capital. The brown haired girl fought down a shiver of 
excitement and a little fear as they began to move, passing beneath 
the walls and out into the city itself.

Utena rode her horse on Anthy&#39;s side of the carriage, while Juri and 
Shiori rode on the other side. All the other guards were under orders 
from Utena to keep an wary eye out as they moved through the cheering 
crowds. Anthy was much loved by the people, but you could never be 
sure.

They rumbled down the cobblestones through broad streets, the windows 
of the buildings lined with people wishing to see their Princess, soon 
to be crowned Queen. They also wanted to see the heroic captain, the 
one who had expelled the dark spirit haunting the castle, and won the 
hand of their beloved Anthy.

Juri kept a pleasant smile on her face even as she murmured softly 
under her breath, &quot;I hate crowds.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be out of the city soon enough,&quot; Shiori smiled, &quot;and then you 
get to worry about bandits, both true and not.&quot;

Tsuwabuki looked over at her in surprise, &quot;Not true bandits? What do 
you mean?&quot; The brown haired young man was a capable guard, hand picked 
by Juri to accompany them. He could be a bit innocent at times, 
though.

Juri smiled grimly, &quot;There are certain nobles whom would benefit it 
Anthy didn&#39;t make it to the capital. So hiring bandits wouldn&#39;t be 
beyond them.&quot;

Tsuwabuki sighed, &quot;I thought we had nipped that in the bud when we 
defeated Akio.&quot;

Anthy said gently, &quot;It may be that we will have a quiet trip to the 
capital. Both Juri and Utena tend to assume the worse.&quot;

Utena laughed softly as she admitted, &quot;It&#39;s a trait most good guards 
have.&quot;

They reached the town&#39;s outer walls, moving out into the royal 
highways that linked all of the great cities of the kingdom of Ohtori. 
The broad roads maintained commerce as well as serving to keep 
communication open between the great families that ruled over the land 
under the King. Around each road was a border, a clear space of 
several hundred paces intended for travelers to camp on as well as to 
deprive bandits of cover.

They rode on silently, enjoying the sun that shone down on them, now 
that they were out of the shade of the tightly packed buildings of the 
city. A gentle breeze blew through fields of green, and trees rose on 
either side of the road&#39;s boundary.

Juri looked over at Utena as she asked her, &quot;We&#39;ll be leaving the 
highway soon?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the plan,&quot; Utena agreed.

&quot;But why?&quot; Miki said, surprised. Leaving the highways would stretch 
the trip out, and the smaller roads were much rougher and less 
comfortable to travel on.

&quot;Traveling the highways would be easier,&quot; Utena patiently explained, 
&quot;but it would also make us very easy to find. The highway is a 
straight line to the capital, leaving us open to attack anywhere along 
its route.&quot;

&quot;While if we take the side roads,&quot; Anthy said thoughtfully, &quot;we can&#39;t 
be tracked so easily.&quot;

Shiori nodded, &quot;Exactly.&quot;

Miki sighed softly, &quot;You&#39;ve got a point.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s do it,&quot; Anthy nodded. She looked over at Utena 
thoughtfully, &quot;I was wondering, why are you only wearing leather 
armor? I would have thought that chain would be better.&quot;

Utena adjusted the leather vest she wore, &quot;Because I don&#39;t know what 
we&#39;ll be running into. Chainmail is very good, but it also hampers 
one&#39;s movement. The leather will slow blows and arrows as well as 
letting me move quickly.&quot;

&quot;But if we were in a stand-up fight against infantry, we&#39;d be wearing 
chain,&quot; Juri shrugged. &quot;It all depends on the circumstances,&quot; she 
smiled. They left the highway soon afterward, and Utena sent two 
outriders ahead to insure the road&#39;s safety.

Keiko smiled cheerfully, &quot;We&#39;ll stay a mile ahead of the group.&quot; A 
hawk perched on the brown haired woman&#39;s shoulder, trained to return 
with a message if necessary.

Utena looked at her and Tsuwabuki, &quot;Don&#39;t take any foolish risks. If 
you run into trouble, send the hawk back and then bolt.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Tsuwabuki smiled impishly. Utena rolled her eyes and 
sent them off.

Perhaps due to Utena&#39;s safety precautions, or simply due to good luck, 
the day&#39;s trip was peace and quiet. As the sun began to set they made 
camp on top of a small hill, a few trees helping with the pitching of 
tends. Guards were stationed, fires started and food was soon 
prepared.

&quot;What&#39;s this I hear about you setting a tent afire?&quot; Anthy asked 
innocently.

&quot;Shiori!&quot; Utena shot a glare at her, but the purple haired mage just 
looked away and whistled innocently.

Miki chuckled softly, &quot;Sounds interesting.&quot;

&quot;How did you manage that?&quot; Juri asked, Shiori cuddling to her side.

Utena sighed softly, knowing that she&#39;d be badgered until she finally 
told. &quot;It was back when Shiori and I were with the Skybolts 
Mercenaries...

There was a healer there named Hitomi that I wanted to get to know. 
She was shy, but she was beautiful, her short brown hair barely 
reaching her shoulders. Her brown eyes were innocent, but somehow 
knowing, too.

Hitomi had many suitors chasing after her, but none of them seemed to 
be able to win her. But I had struck upon a plan.

I went to the cook, and had a special meal prepared. All of Hitomi&#39;s 
favorites, all carefully seasoned and ready to eat. The weather was 
supposed to be bad, so I invited Hitomi into my tent, supposedly to 
simply share a meal and some warmth.

Soft candles light the tent as we ate and talked, and I gently worked 
my charm on her. Feeding morsels of food with my fingers led to other 
things, and soon I had her disrobed. And then...&quot; Utena paused 
dramatically.

&quot;And then?&quot; Anthy asked, her cheeks flaming.

&quot;The tent caught fire,&quot; Utena sighed.

A moment of silence, then soft laughter around the circle.

Shiori grinned, &quot;You should have seen it! Poor Utena and Hitomi bolted 
out of the flaming tent, both stark naked, and it was quite obvious 
what they were doing!&quot;

Utena blushed, &quot;I&#39;m just glad that a mage doused the tent before all 
my stuff burned. As it was, my clothes squelched for days afterward.&quot;

&quot;And Hitomi?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;She settled down with another healer,&quot; Utena admitted.

Talk moved on to other things, and not long after they began to retire 
to bed. Utena smiled at Anthy as they walked to the princess&#39; tent. 
&quot;So am I as pretty as Hitomi?&quot; Anthy asked her.

&quot;Hitomi could not hold a candle to you,&quot; Utena chuckled.

&quot;No talk of candles, please,&quot; Anthy laughed, gently leading Utena into 
the tent they shared.
