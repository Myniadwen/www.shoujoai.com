Ryouko cleaned the bar as the blue haired pirate
grinned at the woman sitting opposite her. &quot;So are you
planing to tell her?&quot; she asked, having heard her
customers tale of deep friendship and possibly love.

:&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Yoruichi Shihoin admitted as the
dusty skinned warrior looked a bit embarrassed. &quot;I
mean, what do I say to her?&quot;

Midori hurried by, the busty young woman looking kind
of sexy in her maid&#39;s uniform as she served a slim,
Asian woman sake. &quot;Here you go, miss,&quot; the redhead
smiled.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Yoruichi moaned, instantly recognizing that
face, even tho she was across the room from her.

&quot;What?&quot; Ryouko asked.

&quot;That&#39;s her,&quot; Yoruichi turned back to Ryouko, &quot;Soi
Fon.&quot;

&quot;Looks kind of scrawny,&quot; Ryouko peered at her.

&quot;Take that back,&quot; Yoruichi said fiercely, almost
looking ready to lunge across the bar at Ryouko.

Ryouko held up a hand, &quot;Just kidding.&quot; She dropped her
voice as she leaned forward, &quot;Have you two talked
about this?&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t really had the chance,&quot; Yoruichi took a
drink, &quot;we only recently got back in touch with each
other.&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t you owe her some kind of explaination?&quot;
Ryouko asked, &quot;If only for her own peace of mind...&quot;

&quot;Damn it...&quot; Yoruichi sighed. &quot;Waitress?&quot;

Midori stopped in front of her, smiling as she
answered, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;That girl you just served,&quot; Yoruichi said, &quot;take her
another sake on me.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Midori agreed, her blue eyes twinkling
with amusement at being the participant in a romantic
drama.

Soi Fon blinked in confusion as MIdori delivered her
drink then looked up at her with a slight frown, &quot;I
didn&#39;t order this.&quot;

&quot;The lady at the bar sent this,&quot; Midori answered,
&quot;with her compliments.&quot;

Soi Fon looked up curiously, then froze as her mouth
dropped open and she gasped out, &quot;Yoruichi-sama?&quot;

From where she sat at the bar, Yoruichi gracefully
rose then strode across the bar, her black hair
shining in the lights. She looked like a goddess
amoung the common denizens of the bar, a warrior queen
among peasants. Soi Fon felt a quiver of anxiety as
she reached her table, studying her a moment...

&quot;Yo,&quot; Yoruichi smiled, sitting down.

&quot;They look like they&#39;re getting along well,&quot; Mahoro
noted, the pretty black haired combat android having
arrived to assist Ryouko.

&quot;As long as no fights start, I&#39;m happy,&quot; Midori
offered, giving them both a grin.

&quot;I thought HIME like you liked fights,&quot; Ryouko noted.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Midori held up her hands, &quot;I&#39;m just here to pay
off my bar tab.&quot;

Outside, a orange haired young woman waited in the
line to get inside the club. &quot;It&#39;s crazy,&quot; Julie Power
admitted to another woman in line, &quot;I never expected
to find a club like this in downtown LA.&quot;

&quot;Neither did I,&quot; Karolina Dean agreed, the blonde
standing by her lover Xavin. She flushed slightly, &quot;No
grudges over our teams fighting?&quot;

Julie looked sheepish, &quot;Well, it was our fault
anyway.&quot; Quickly changing the subject she looked at
the woman beside Karolina, &quot;So this is your
girlfriend?&quot;

Xavin smiled, her long brown hair flowing over her
shoulders as she commented, &quot;I still can&#39;t get over
how easily you human&#39;s forgive. If a Kree did that,
I&#39;d have declared us blood enemies to the death.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Julie blinked as they shuffled forward towards
the doors.

&quot;Xavin&#39;s a Skrull,&quot; Karolina pointed out, &quot;they tend
to nurse grudges for a long time, apparently.&quot;

&quot;We have tough nipples,&quot; Xavin said deadpan before
cracking a smile.

&quot;Get a sense of humor,&quot; Julie shook her head, but
still chuckled softly.

A bit tentatively Karolina asked, &quot;Are you here with
someone? If you&#39;d like we could keep you company.&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s fine,&quot; Julie chuckled as they reached the
door woman, &quot;I have a date, assuming she gets here.&quot;

&quot;Identification?&quot; the woman dressed in black asked.
Cybersix was fairly certain they were legal, but she
felt obligated to check just in case. Seeing
everything was fine she waved them in, &quot;Have a good
time.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Xavin said, frowning.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Karolina asked softly.

&quot;I can tell she&#39;s been mechanically augmented,&quot; Xavin
murmured as they went down the hall, &quot;it... disturbs
me.&quot;

&quot;You can tell?&quot; the greeter girl asked, the brown
haired woman dressed in a red and white maid&#39;s
uniform. She smiled, &quot;My name is May, welcome to
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

&quot;Ah, there she is,&quot; Julie smiled as a blonde woman
waved to her. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said before heading off
to see her friend. &quot;Jennifer, I thought we were going
to meet outside?&quot;

Jennifer Kale smiled as she got up from her seat and
said, &quot;Sorry, I got here a bit earlier than planned.&quot;

&quot;No chain mail bikini?&quot; Julie teased as she reached
out to touch the conservative blouse the older woman
was wearing.

&quot;I could change into that later,&quot; Jennifer purred into
her ear, &quot;if you want.&quot;

Julie blushed, &quot;Maybe so...&quot;

&quot;Chain mail bikini?&quot; Xavin murmured as they were lead
to a table.

Karolina looked amused, &quot;I assume they dress up for
fun.&quot;

May smiled as she passed them each menus, &quot;In addition
to renting rooms for a hour or two, we now offer
costume rentals too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; Karolina blinked.

&quot;No,&quot; May shook her head, &quot;in fact, our police girl,
maid and soldier sets are often the first to sell
out.&quot;

&quot;That says something significant about humanity,&quot;
Xavin mused after a moment, &quot;but I can&#39;t quite decide
what.&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Karolina blushed, &quot;we have enough fun with
your alternate identities.&quot;

May decided not to ask. &quot;If you like, I can come back
in a bit to collect your order?&quot; she offered
cheerfully.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Xavin smiled, gazing lingeringly in
Karolina&#39;s eyes.

May headed back to the bar smiling, &#39;I should give
them some time alone.&#39; She passed by two other
customers and lingered, seeing they were talking
intently.

&quot;So,&quot; Soi Fon looked at Yoruichi lingeringly, the
drinks having given her unusual courage, &quot;what do you
intend to do now?&quot;

Yoruichi smiled back as she quietly admitted, &quot;I will
be returning to earth, but...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Soi Fon asked softly, looking into her eyes.

Yoruichi reached out to stroke her pale cheek gently,
&quot;I&#39;d love to have you visit me some time.&quot;

Soi Fon sighed happily, rubbing her cheek up against
that caressing hand like a cat. &quot;And I&#39;d love to visit
you,&quot; she agreed, not mentioning what else she wanted
to do with her.

&quot;Then it&#39;s a date,&quot; Yoruichi agreed, her eyes
twinkling warmly. She stretched out in a cat-like way,
sighing as she said, &quot;Now I think I&#39;d better sleep
this off, or I&#39;m going to feel terrible in the
morning.&quot;

As Yoruichi got up from her chair Soi Fon got up,
grabbing her hand before she could leave,
&quot;Yoruichi-sama?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Yoruichi asked.

Seizing all her courage Soi Fon leaned forward to kiss
her gently. &quot;For later,&quot; she smiled.

With a grin Yoruichi agreed, &quot;Later.&quot;

Sighing happily May moved on, arriving at the bar as
Excel and Hyatt were ready to go on shift. Relaying
the details on the guests she had been serving she
added, &quot;I think Julie and Jennifer may need a room
later, possibly Xavin and Karolina too.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Excel Excel nodded
cheerfully.
