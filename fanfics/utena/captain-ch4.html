<h1>Captain of the Guard (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/captain-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Shiori looked with a fair degree of admiration to Asugawa Juri, who 
was guarding the door to the Princess and Utena&#146;s new rooms. Utena 
frowned, trying to remember a name. &#147;Weren&#146;t you with Usagi when I 
left?&#148; she asked curiously.

Shiori laughed, &#147;You didn&#146;t expect that to last, did you?&#148; She 
chuckled, continuing &#147;Besides, that shrine maiden, Rei, was also after 
her.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t know that,&#148; Utena admitted.

Smiling ruefully, Shiori said, &#147;Neither did I!&#148;

&#147;Asugawa Juri,&#148; Utena said as they got near enough to talk, &#147;meet 
Takatsuki Shiori.&#148; Utena smiled, she had been looking forward to this, 
and from the looks these two were sharing, and she didn&#146;t think she&#146;d 
be disappointed.

Juri smiled, taking Shiori&#146;s hand and kissing it. &#147;Charmed,&#148; she said, 
looking Shiori over. &#147;You&#146;re far too beautiful to be a mage, cooped up 
all day with dusty books!&#148; she exclaimed dramatically.

Shiori laughed softly, smiling up at Juri. &#147;You&#146;re much too kind,&#148; she 
said with a wry smile. She cupped her hands in front of her, 
concentrated a moment, and a soft golden light appeared between her 
fingers. From it, Shiori drew a golden rose that she gently passed to 
Juri.

Juri looked mildly stunned, and Utena was sorry to interfere, but &#147;We 
need to go in to see the Princess.&#148; Shiori shot Utena a disappointed 
look, and Utena shrugged.

Juri opened the door, and watched with a great deal of interest as 
Shiori walked in. Shiori noticed and gave Juri an extra wiggle of her 
behind, and it took all Utena&#146;s self control not to laugh. Still 
smiling slightly, Utena said &#147;Princess Anthy, meet Takatsuki Shiori, a 
warmage.&#148;

&#147;Warmage?&#148; Anthy said, surprised.

Shiori frowned at Utena, and said to the princess &#147;Retired warmage, 
really. I teach, now, at a school run by friends of ours.&#148;

&#147;I see,&#148; Anthy said smiling. &#147;I wanted to see you when you arrived, to 
thank you for your help. I hope it&#146;s not needed, but Utena is 
concerned.&#148;

&#147;Trust her instincts,&#148; Shiori said dryly, &#147;they&#146;ve saved my life more 
than once.&#148; She turned to Utena, and asked, &#147;Do you want me to start 
here?&#148;

&#147;Yes, please,&#148; Utena said calmly. Inside, she was a bit irritated at 
the princess&#146; remark. &#145;Utena is concerned&#146; indeed! Still, the girl had 
never seen combat, so...

Shiori raised her hands in the air, concentrating. A glow appeared 
around them, then a complex pattern appeared on the floor, anchored by 
a stylized sun and moon. It expanded, slowly turning, until it lit the 
entire room, highlighting so many black splotches on the walls

they looked painted black. The darkness writhed and struggled under 
the light, until they burned away.

&#147;This is bad,&#148; Shiori panted softly. She staggered, Utena grabbed her 
before she fell, and Shiori gasped out, &#147;I&#146;ve got to ward this room, 
now that I&#146;ve cleared it!&#148;

&#147;Take my strength,&#148; Utena said, gently grasping Shiori by the 
shoulders and practically holding her upright. The light Shiori 
wielded this time was white, and it etched the lines of the room&#146;s 
walls, roof, and door, until it softly faded.

&#147;This room&#146;s safe from dark magics,&#148; Shiori said weakly. Utena picked 
her up, and gently sat her in a nearby chair. Shiori smiled up at her 
gratefully, and Anthy felt a stab of jealousy. &#147;The spells in here 
were very powerful,&#148; Shiori said softly, &#147;we&#146;re dealing with a mage 
level, at least.&#148;

&#147;Mage level?&#148; Anthy asked, frowning.

Utena answered, &#147;There are various levels of magic user: apprentice, 
hedge wizard, wizard, mage, arch-mage, and sorcerer. The final two are 
incredibly difficult to attain.&#148; She looked at Shiori worriedly, &#147;Not 
an arch-mage, surely?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; she said levelly, &#147;but I intend to find out. Those 
were black magics, Utena, the blackest.&#148; She looked grim, &#147;Blood 
magic.&#148;

&#147;If you stay in the castle, will you be safe?&#148; Utena asked.

&#147;NOBODY is safe here,&#148; Shiori said grimly, &#147;but my magics will protect 
me.&#148;

Utena went to the door, and got Juri. &#147;Take Shiori to her rooms, carry 
her if you need to,&#148; Utena said, concern obvious in her voice. Juri 
gently picked up the exhausted mage, over her half-hearted protests, 
and started to carry her out.

Shiori smiled sleepily as Juri carried her away. Anthy and Utena heard 
her mumbling as she left: &#147;Held in a strong woman&#146;s arms. My favorite 
place to be. Too bad I&#146;m not awake enough to enjoy it.&#148;

Anthy shook her head as the other two women left. &#147;It seems you&#146;re 
right again, Utena,&#148; she sighed softly. She looked more than a little 
scared as she asked &#147;So what happens now?&#148;

Utena walked over to her, putting her hand on Anthy&#146;s arm 
comfortingly, &#147;Once Shiori recovers, we&#146;ll have to go through the 
palace and clear the place of dark magics.&#148;

She shrugs, &#147;It&#146;ll take time, but it will limit the enemy&#146;s ability to 
attack you here.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s good to know,&#148; Anthy said softly. &#147;Is it so difficult, what 
Shiori does?&#148;

Utena nods, &#147;Cleansing and warding can be very difficult, especially 
against a magician more powerful than you are.&#148;

Anthy was about to say something more, when she saw the clock on the 
wall. &#147;Oh no, we&#146;re late!&#148; Anthy cried.

&#147;Late for what?&#148; Utena said, surprised.

Anthy looked at her like she was dense. &#147;The reception dinner tonight, 
welcoming me home! I can&#146;t miss it, as the guest of honor, and you&#146;re 
my bodyguard, so...&#148;

Utena groaned softly, even as Anthy hurried into the bedroom to get 
dressed. &#145;Goddess, I hate formal dinners,&#146; Utena thought. She waited a 
few moments, then realized she needed to change too. &#147;Anthy,&#148; she 
called through the door, &#147;can I come in?&#148; She heard what sounded like 
a yes, and opened the door, only to freeze in place.

Anthy was dressed, if that was the word for it, only in a corset, 
under things and stockings. She filled them out very well, leaving 
Utena dry mouthed and shaken. Anthy smiled sweetly, apparently not 
noticing her reaction, &#147;Utena, would you wear your dress uniform? You 
looked so good in it when I first met you.&#148;

&#147;Of course,&#148; Utena managed to get out, fished her dress uniform from 
the closet and then all but fled. She ducked into the bath and changed 
quickly, haunted by the very pleasing scene she had just left.

Anthy smiled a bit, looking at the closed bathroom door. She filed 
away the fact that Utena was shy away with all the other things she 
had noticed about her, while she continued to dress. She smoothed her 
skirt down, and thought &#145;Maybe I&#146;ll enjoy this dinner after all.&#146; </pre>
