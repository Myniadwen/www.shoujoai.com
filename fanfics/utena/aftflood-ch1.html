<h1>After the Flood (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lectricity.html">The Ghost of 'lectricity</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hope you like the story, I put much effort into it. If you 
haven&#39;t watched the TV Series this isn&#39;t gonna make much 
sense. Even though it&#39;s based on the TV series Utena 
turned out a bit more like in the movie - character wise. 
I&#39;d love some feedback, any kind of it.

--------------------------------------------------

The one left behind

--------------------------------------------------

 She held the letter in her hand, afraid to open it. 
Afraid that after it&#39;s open, after it&#39;s read everything 
will come to an end, to a closure, nothing will be left of 
her anymore and that she&#39;d truly disappear. She was afraid 
that it was all a dream, that what had been would fade and 
disappear forever. After all - she wasn&#39;t here. Anthy felt 
lost, alone and broken - worse that ever before.

 She tried to ignore those feelings for the last few days, 
tried to lock them away like she was used to but somehow 
she couldn&#39;t. Nothing was like it was anymore. She felt as 
if the whole world has changed, like it broke to pieces 
and all parts were put back together by a madman. But 
apparently the only thing that changed was her. Did it 
even matter what was in the letter? No, because Utena 
left. Even though she tried to reach out to Anthy it was 
of no use. Nobody will ever be able to open that coffin. 
It won&#39;t budge, not from the outside... Maybe it wasn&#39;t so 
much Anthy that changed, maybe it was the perspective that 
changed. Maybe somehow it did open just a bit...

 She sat down on her old bed in the room of the abandoned 
dormitory. Why did Utena leave the letter here in this 
room? Probably because of her brother. That was the most 
logical explanation. Anthy liked logic, logic she could 
understand. Feelings, oh, she was a master at reading 
people&#39;s hearts. Her own feelings, that was the harder 
part. And she didn&#39;t have a particularly good feeling 
about the letter. She didn&#39;t have a particularly good 
feeling about anything lately. And she hated this feeling. 
Why did Utena even leave a letter? Anthy had utterly 
betrayed her. Surely Utena went on, to find someone who&#39;ll 
believe in her. But that was natural, how it ended. Anthy 
had brought it on herself.

 In the little world Anthy had constructed for herself 
there was no place for her feelings. And no place for 
hope. That&#39;s how she distanced herself. While she managed 
to keep the feelings out, Utena secretly slipped a bit of 
hope inside. Hope that messed her up completely.

 Utena was always so open with her feelings. She was 
wearing her heart so open everyone could see it. It 
irritated Anthy. How was she able to do it? She tried to 
be Anthy&#39;s friend even though she knew nothing about her. 
Why did she even fight? She was so stupid, not noticing 
how she and her brother set her up. She fought so hard for 
Anthy&#39;s sake that she burned out, inside and out, becoming 
an easy pray for Akio. For Anthy&#39;s sake... For her... 
Anthy&#39;s hands became sweaty as she finally began opening 
the letter with her name on.

 &quot;Himemiya,&quot; it began in shaky handwriting. &quot;I am sorry 
for what happened. For everything that happened. I really 
thought I could help you. Now I don&#39;t know if you wanted 
or even needed to be helped. I still have a strong feeling 
of helping you. In the end, I guess even I considered you 
my property. I think I didn&#39;t want to see what was going 
on, all around me. Maybe sensing my feelings for you I 
tried to deny myself and pushed myself into something I 
wasn&#39;t. I still can&#39;t think clearly. I&#39;m traveling south, 
along the coast, there&#39;s a little town at the sea there, 
something like the town down below.&quot; There was a pause in 
the writing, then it continued, shaky once again.

 &quot;I hope we can meet again someday, maybe it will be 
different from this time. But, I don&#39;t want it to be any 
different from what it was... I didn&#39;t want this to sound 
like a goodbye note, but I guess it does. I really want to 
see you again - I miss you. I&#39;m so sorry. Utena.&quot;

 This was something Anthy didn&#39;t expect at all. What was 
Utena saying? Why did she sound so depressed? She wanted 
her with her? She wanted things to be like they were? 
Suddenly Anthy realized something. Something that made all 
the closed doors inside her swing open and realize there 
wasn&#39;t any coffin any more.

 Because Utena did it. Utena changed something! She had 
revolutionized the world. Anthy&#39;s world! She changed her. 
Utena changed her, and none of them even realized it. 
Utena accomplished something. No one can change the whole 
world. No one can revolutionize the world completely. All 
someone can do is change people&#39;s hearts! And Utena did 
it. She changed Anthy&#39;s heart. And not just hers. It all 
became clear... Jury, Miki, even Touga. Now it became 
clear to her, what she should&#39;ve done.

 Anthy was overcome with a rush of emotions, something she 
was slowly getting used to. She lay down on her old bed, 
looking up at Utena&#39;s top bed. She could feel her 
heartbeat up in her throat, she could feel a smile forcing 
itself on her face and hot tears into her eyes. There was 
still time. The letter was written some more that two 
weeks ago, just after it all finished. Maybe Utena was 
still there, in that town. Maybe Anthy can also change 
something. At least she could try to make Utena smile 
again.

 Getting up she took the room in, trying to imprint it in 
her memory. She won&#39;t be seeing it again. She went home, 
trying to calm down some on the way. Everything seemed so 
trivial now. When she got to the tower she noticed her 
brother at the computer, probably plotting something 
revolutionary. She walked up to him, a smile playing on 
her lips.

 &quot;It hasn&#39;t been that long since then, but everyone&#39;s 
completely forgotten about her,&quot; he said without looking 
at her. He seemed different too. He had such a boyish face 
when he was off guard. That was what had made her want to 
protect him, like a good big sister should.

 &quot;She didn&#39;t cause a revolution after all. She was just a 
passerby to this world.&quot; Of course she was just a 
passerby. She didn&#39;t belong here, in this illusionary 
world.

 Now that the whole ordeal was over yet again he seemed to 
relax a bit. But here he was at his computer again 
printing the infamous &#39;Letters from The Ends of the 
World&#39;. He loved to walk on the edge, to risk it all.

 But now after a long time she felt something towards him. 
She pitied him. She pitied him for being what he is. And 
she was angry. How dare he judge Utena&#39;s actions. He, the 
Prince who forgot what it means to be a prince.

 He never did anything the like that for Anthy. He never 
actually really tried to save her from her suffering. Of 
course not, since she was taking the burden of his 
suffering. But it had been her own mistake and now it was 
up to her to end it. He made her believe it was her fault 
what he had become. Of course not directly but because of 
the whole show he had put up made her believe that. It was 
her own fault that she fell for it.

 &quot;Time to start from scratch with the Rose Signets. I&#39;m 
Counting on you, Anthy.&quot;

 &quot;You don&#39;t know what happened, do you?&quot; she said calmly 
smiling. The pity for him was so much stronger that her 
anger. Chu-Chu looked at her sadly as she took off her 
glasses, behind which she had been hiding for a long time 
now. He too will have to say goodbye.

 &quot;What?&quot; the confused boy asked, not even understanding 
what she said but instead surprised at seeing her 
mockingly smiling face.

 &quot;It&#39;s all right. Please continue playing &#39;Prince&#39; inside 
your coffin forever. But,&quot; she went on, taking off the 
ring and watching Chu-Chu take off his tie. It looked like 
a small shield, now that she looked at it. Was this 
everything he ever gave her to protect herself from the 
countless knives of hate aimed at her instead of him? &quot;I 
have to go!&quot;

 &quot;Go? To where?&quot;

 &quot;She hasn&#39;t vanished. She merely departed from your 
world.&quot; Something Anthy was also about to do.

 &quot;What are you talking about? W- Wait a minute! Anthy! 
Anthy!!&quot; He kept calling after her but she was beyond his 
reach already.

 &quot;Farewell,&quot; she said to the one that didn&#39;t understand.

 In her room she quickly packed, taking some clothes, the 
picture of her and Utena, the letter from Utena and whole 
stacks of her brother&#39;s money. Not that she really needed 
it, but it was convenient. And it felt so good taking it 
from him. She quickly left the tower stopping at the 
entrance gate to wait for Chu-Chu.

 Taking the final step outside she looked back to see an 
ancient gate leading into a deep and dark forest. All the 
glorious buildings and towers of Ohtori, which were in 
reality just trees and hollow trunks. She felt a bit sad 
for all still in their self-imposed prisons, but everyone 
had the power to leave this place inside themselves. On 
her shoulder, her companion, the personification of her 
joys and desires, her inner self Chu-Chu was also gone.
