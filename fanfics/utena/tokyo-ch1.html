<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 1 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<pre>Anthy shook her head in wonder, drinking cautiously from the jar of 
animal blood she cradled in her hands. &#39;Breakfast of champions,&#39; she 
thought ruefully. It was ridiculously easy to get here in Tokyo, 
making her wonder if other vampires in this city abstained from the 
drinking of human blood, too. &#39;It&#39;s not unlikely,&#39; she had to admit.

Utena stepped out of the bedroom, and the other girl groupies rushed 
in to see how Hitomi was. Her pale skin had a bit of flush after her 
feeding, her short pink hair brushing along her shoulders. Her 
piercing robin blue eyes swept the large room, and a smile teased her 
lips when she saw Anthy sitting there. &quot;Good evening,&quot; she said 
quietly.

&quot;You look good,&quot; Anthy smiled back.

Wakaba walked in from the bathroom, her hair damp from washing and 
dressed in a long cotton bathrobe. &quot;This apartment is incredible,&quot; she 
said, looking around happily. &quot;You said it belongs to your aunt?&quot; 
Wakaba asked.

&quot;Aunt Yurika, yes,&quot; Utena said softly. Her expression was troubled, 
&quot;She helped raise me after my parents died. But she&#39;s in Holland on 
her job.&quot;

&quot;What does she do?&quot; Wakaba asked curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s a decorator,&quot; Utena shrugged.

&quot;Have you told her about...?&quot; Anthy asked tentatively.

Utena shook her head, &quot;No, not yet.&quot; She smiled sadly, &quot;This isn&#39;t the 
sort of thing you can explain to someone over the phone, I want to see 
her in front of me when I try to tell her.&quot; She closed her eyes, 
remembering...

They had driven into town yesterday&#39;s evening, and Utena had lead them 
through town to her Aunt&#39;s apartment building. She called her Aunt 
long distance, and tentatively explained that she and some friends 
were in Tokyo.

Her Aunt had sounded a bit startled, wondering why Utena had left the 
academy so quickly. Utena sketched in some of the killings at the 
school while leaving out the bits about vampires, and her Aunt&#39;s 
surprise was evident. She gave them permission to stay there, and then 
called up the front desk. The young man gave Utena her keys, and the 
group had trooped their way up to the suite.

&quot;What&#39;s it like, being home?&quot; Wakaba asked cheerfully.

Utena sighed, &quot;I haven&#39;t quite decided.&quot; She walked over to the living 
room window, gazing out into the night at the glittering lights of the 
city. She stood there silently for a few moments, then softly, &quot;I&#39;m 
going out.&quot;

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Anthy asked as Utena strode by her, quickly 
pressing the apartment keys into her hands.

&quot;Just to look around,&quot; Utena smiled slightly. &quot;I won&#39;t be long,&quot; she 
added, smoothly closing the door behind her.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you go with her?&quot; Wakaba asked Anthy worriedly. &quot;we don&#39;t 
know what things are out there at night,&quot; she fretted.

Anthy shook her head. &quot;Utena can take care of herself,&quot; she said 
firmly, adding quietly, &quot;At least, I hope so.&quot;
Utena leaned against the wall of the elevator, watching the lights 
count down as it descended to the ground floor. She strode into the 
lobby, smiling carefully at the security guard. &#39;Can&#39;t let him see the 
teeth,&#39; she thought.

It was a bit cooler, outside, and she sighed softly in relief. &#39;That 
feels good,&#39; Utena thought. She remembered walking this way to school, 
and let her feet walk the route they had memorized long ago. She 
ducked down alleys and jumped over walls, the dangerous route her best 
friend had always scolded her about using.

A few times she caught the eye of men lingering on the street, boldly 
assessing her as a possible target. She met their eyes cooly, and they 
would pull back, giving her plenty of room. &#39;They can see the beast 
inside of me,&#39; she thought with a bit of grim satisfaction. &#39;Or 
they&#39;ve run into others like me,&#39; she thought.

She walked along the water, remembering falling in there, nearly 
drowning. She still didn&#39;t entirely remember who had saved her, just 
gentle hands, and... the scent of roses. &#39;Roses,&#39; she frowned, trying 
to recall, then she shook her head.

Utena reached the chain link fence and leaned up against it as she 
gazed in at the school buildings. They all looked smaller, somehow, 
less imposing than what she remembered. The faces of friends flashed 
across her mind&#39;s eye, teachers that she had called out greetings to 
every day, and she was struck by a deep, aching pain.

&#39;I&#39;m not part of this life anymore,&#39; Utena thought sadly, &#39;I can&#39;t 
be.&#39; The sunlight, school friends, all of that was so far beyond her 
reach, it might as well have been another world.

&quot;Checking out the hunting grounds?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice challenged her.

Utena jerked in surprise, silently cursing that she had been so 
wrapped up in her thoughts that she had never even heard her coming. 
Her nose told her that the lady was human, but there was something... 
odd about her.

&quot;No,&quot; Utena quietly answered her while watching her warily, &quot;I was 
just remembering where I used to live.&quot; Her eyes narrowed, &quot;And I 
don&#39;t hunt.&quot;

The redhead walked into the light, dressed in white blouse and tight 
red pants. She was beautiful, as well as generously proportioned. 
Strangely, it looked like she was carrying a tube of lipstick in her 
hand.

Her gaze was piercing, meeting Utena&#39;s own gaze fearlessly. &quot;I 
think...&quot; she said to her thoughtfully, &quot;I believe you.&quot; She put the 
lipstick away, then offered her hand, &quot;Ayeka Kisaragi.&quot;

&quot;Utena Tenjou,&quot; and she gently took the redhead&#39;s hand in her own. 
Utena looked her over, and realized, &quot;You&#39;re a miko, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;A professional, yes,&quot; Ayeka said, handing over a business card.

&quot;Phantom Quest Corporation,&quot; Utena read it thoughtfully.

Ayeka turned to walk away, saying over her shoulder, &quot;I think we&#39;ll 
meet again.&quot;

&quot;Well, that was interesting,&quot; Utena muttered. She walked home slowly, 
enjoying the relative quiet, trying to collect her thoughts. &#39;That 
lady wasn&#39;t too surprised to see someone like me,&#39; Utena felt a bit 
relieved, &#39;maybe vampires aren&#39;t that rare in this town.&#39;

&quot;Help!&quot; a woman&#39;s voice cried out.

Without even thinking about it, Utena was on the move. She raced down 
the Alley, coming across a ragged figure, pressing someone against the 
wall. She grabbed him by the back of his coat, tearing him away from 
his prey.

&quot;Oh, god,&quot; the girl gasped out softly, shaking visibly.

The man barred his teeth, fangs gleaming in the darkness. It was 
obvious that he didn&#39;t realize that Utena was a vampire, relying on 
his vampire nature to try and frighten her away.

&quot;Go, now,&quot; Utena said to the girl softly, &quot;run, and don&#39;t turn back.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; the vampire bit out, lunging forward.

Utena gave him a grin, letting her fangs gleam in the light of the 
streetlights. He froze for a moment, then charged at her. Utena 
blocked his blows, feeling mildly surprised. He was so weak, even 
compared to Touga and the others, stopping him was almost effortless.

&quot;Leave this city now,&quot; Utena told him, &quot;and I&#39;ll let you live.&quot;

She didn&#39;t have high hopes, but she had to try. She wasn&#39;t 
disappointed, as the vampire hissed and lunged at her again. Utena 
smoothly drew the stake she now carried with her always, and drove it 
into his heart. He stiffened, looking down at his chest in shock, then 
promptly fell over.

&quot;Just like home,&quot; Utena grumbled softly. </pre>
