--------------------------------------------------

 Utena acted quite uneasy the next day. She got up while 
Anthy was still sleeping and put on her cheerful face for 
the day. Anthy secretly watched her as she made herself 
busy by unpacking Anthy&#39;s suitcase. Apparently they&#39;ll 
stay here for a while. Utena was actually very orderly 
when she wanted to be, Anthy noted to herself. She had a 
somewhat housewife-ish air about her when she was cleaning 
or cooking.

 When she was done Utena just flopped down on the sofa and 
at last realized was being watched. &quot;Ah, you&#39;re awake,&quot; 
she said. Anthy nodded and sat up in the bed. &quot;How did you 
sleep?&quot;

 Anthy smiled and said: &quot;I&#39;ve never slept better. Although 
I...&quot; She let her voice trail off letting Utena guess what 
she meant. Utena managed to keep her blush under control 
and tried to move the conversation somewhere else. &quot;I 
don&#39;t have anything to offer you for breakfast-&quot;

 &quot;Then we&#39;ll eat the sandwiches I bought yesterday,&quot; Anthy 
interrupted Utena smiling. Utena sighed before continuing. 
She wanted to treat Anthy like the princess she deserved 
to be, she really tried, but her resources were extremely 
limited.

 &quot;Also, I don&#39;t have any money to buy something to make 
lunch...&quot;

 &quot;That&#39;s no problem, I have enough money for us both.&quot; 
Utena just kept staring.

 &quot;You&#39;ve changed, you know,&quot; she said after a while.

 &quot;Have I?&quot; Anthy got up and walked slowly over to Utena. 
Her long nightgown was flowing slightly after her before 
she reached the sofa and leaned down to Utena, looking 
directly into her eyes all the while. Utena&#39;s blood raced 
into her cheeks as Anthy watched her from up close. 
Somewhere to their left more and more locks of dark hair 
kept falling from behind Anthy&#39;s ear, casting a shadow 
onto their faces.

 &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; she then declared, moved away and 
walked into the bathroom, a smile playing on her lips. 
Utena was left on the sofa flustered and lips parted, 
breathing heavily and still waiting. She fell back into 
the sofa as she realized that her back arched from it and 
she had been stretching towards where Anthy had been.

 She was thoroughly confused. With herself and with Anthy. 
Anthy changed and Utena wasn&#39;t sure if she was still able 
to follow her. And even though Anthy was here now Utena 
still couldn&#39;t shake the feeling as if something was 
exactly how she didn&#39;t wanted it to be. It was something 
important and she knew what it was, but she wanted to keep 
it the way things were now a bit longer.

--------------------------------------------------

 The day was dragging itself along slowly as they were 
walking through the narrow alleys back home. The sun was 
at it&#39;s peak and they were trying to catch those few 
shadows that preserved. Soon enough they were back at the 
hotel again in their cool room. And since she had nowhere 
to put herself Utena started making lunch.

 Anthy tried to help but without knowing what her not very 
talkative companion was making she couldn&#39;t actually do 
much. They ate and didn&#39;t talk much. They cleaned up. 
Later Utena settled herself back into the sofa again. She 
felt somehow very tired. Like she was running all the 
time. She could see herself, running, running after her - 
after Anthy, who was running too but away from her, and 
she couldn&#39;t run faster, she couldn&#39;t reach Anthy, she 
couldn&#39;t run, and couldn&#39;t reach her, couldn&#39;t run anymore 
and she felt hundreds of hands hold her, tried to pull 
away but couldn&#39;t so she pulled and pushed until she fell 
to the ground, exhausted, panting and everything went 
black... 

 She must have fallen asleep because when she next came to 
herself she was quite comfortably nestled on Anthy&#39;s 
shoulder with whom she was suddenly sharing the sofa. A 
soft hand was stroking her head and another arm was 
leisurely draped around her shoulders. Almost naturally 
her own arm reached out and nestled somewhere in Anthy&#39;s 
lap. It was comfortable and soft and Utena promptly dozed 
off again.

 &quot;Nobody really possessed you...&quot; Utena suddenly said in a 
low voice. Her own voice somehow paralyzed her and she 
wasn&#39;t sure if the conversation she so clearly remembered 
was actually happening or was it part of a dream.

 &quot;What?&quot; Anthy asked surprised. Utena was also startled 
and completely awake again. After some time she needed to 
collect her thoughts she spoke again.

 &quot;I don&#39;t think anybody ever really possessed you; you 
know, owned you. It was them who were in your possession. 
You just needed to realize that to break free from the 
circle you were trapped in.&quot;

 &quot;No,&quot; Anthy answered softly but determined. &quot;There was 
someone who was able to possess me. I just needed to 
realize who it was.&quot; Utena tried to figure out what that 
meant but couldn&#39;t really think clearly.

 &quot;Himemiya... you&#39;ve changed...&quot; she said and her voice 
sounded sad even if she didn&#39;t want it to.

 &quot;Does it bother you so much? You&#39;ve already mentioned it 
twice...&quot; Anthy answered, her voice sounding as old as 
time itself.

 &quot;I&#39;m scared... That you&#39;ll leave me behind.&quot; Pausing she 
thought about what she had just said. &quot;I&#39;m scared that I 
won&#39;t be able to be your prince. Because I no prince. I&#39;m 
scared because I feel like I&#39;m losing myself. Because I 
don&#39;t understand my feelings anymore. We used to be 
friends but long since it&#39;s more than just friends and I 
don&#39;t know if you sharre my feelings. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s 
my role. I&#39;m scared of being your prince because- I just 
want to be a simple girl, you know...&quot; Her hand was now 
holding Anthy around her waist. She wanted to stay like 
this forever. Being held by the one she cared for, by the 
one who cared for her.

 &quot;Utena... I had said things to you I never wanted to. 
What I feel for you- I don&#39;t know how to express myself... 
I want to explain to you how much I love you, but it&#39;s so 
much more. When you say I&#39;ve changed, it&#39;s just that I 
have accepted you and I have accepted me; I used to hate 
myself. You gave me strength to stand on my own two feet. 
I don&#39;t want you to be my prince, since you&#39;re a Princess 
yourself. A princess in shining armor on a white horse. 
You saved me. I don&#39;t need a prince anymore - so, just be 
yourself.&quot;

 &quot;You shouldn&#39;t think so much of me,&quot; Utena said, grimly.

 &quot;I love you,&quot; Anthy answered looking at Utena&#39;s obscured 
eyes. Utena was gazing at Anthy&#39;s serious face for a long 
time. Then she closed her eyes and felt Anthy&#39;s head close 
in on her until their lips met gently and softly.

 The kiss was short as neither was sure how to proceed 
further. After their lips broke contact Utena moved away 
to catch her breath while Anthy&#39;s hand circled around her 
neck and draw her head nearer again. But before she could 
reach her Utena stopped her with a sharp glare.

 &quot;Don&#39;t ever leave me. I need you.&quot; She kept her eyes 
fixed on Anthy&#39;s, looking for signs of hesitation

 &quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Anthy said firmly, once again closing the 
distance between them, binding their lips together in 
another kiss, this time more determined, more demanding 
and passionate.

 Utena&#39;s arms were lightly holding her somewhere at her 
hips and she was completely passive. Anthy seized the 
opportunity and parted her own lips, Utena&#39;s following 
obediently. Her tongue slowly made it&#39;s way to Utena&#39;s 
lips, drawing a few moans from deeper down her throat. 
More of those followed as their tongues made contact, less 
ravishing but instead slower and more placid.

 Quite naturally Anthy&#39;s hand moved down to Utena&#39;s chest 
where it settled on her left breast. She felt the hardened 
nipple clearly even through her bra and shirt.

 Her hand slowly went lower, down to Utena&#39;s waist while 
she tried to steer herself upon Utena, who has completely 
given herself to her. Her hands caught the hem of Utena&#39;s 
shirt and slowly began to take it off. Reluctantly she had 
to break their lasting kiss to lift the item over the pink 
head. Utena fell into the sofa as Anthy leaned backward to 
admire her doing. Pink hair was splayed around half 
closed, helplessly inviting eyes. And for a moment she saw 
herself in those eyes, causing her to freeze momentarily.

 &quot;Anthy...&quot; Utena whispered in a daze, then smiling and 
blushing on account of herself. &quot;Don&#39;t stop now,&quot; she 
breathed out, almost as an afterthought. Anthy smiled, 
returning to her jumbled senses and put her hands on both 
sides of Utena athletic waist. She slid her hands 
painfully slowly and gently from Utena&#39;s bare, delicate 
waist upward, leaving her quivering and gasping for air. 
She reached the simple white bra and reached around the 
back, pressing herself against Utena as she caught her 
lips again.

 She undid the bra, slowly taking it off her lover. She 
marveled at the rather small white breasts with pink 
areolas and, by now, very erect nipples. The areolas were 
almost unrecognizable as they were just a shade darker 
than the skin around. Her hands cupped the two mounds and 
squeezed a bit, making the pink-haired beauty inhale 
deeply. Satisfied with the response she lowered her head 
down to Utena&#39;s chest and licked teasingly in the valley 
between them. Utena arched her back temptingly towards 
Anthy, who couldn&#39;t help but smile at the reaction. As she 
finally took a nipple in her mouth Utena let out a long 
and low &#39;Aah!&#39; but she released it then.

 &quot;You&#39;ve always been such a tease...&quot; Utena hissed 
seductively between ragged breathing, sighs and gasps.

 &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I won&#39;t do it again,&quot; Anthy replied, 
grinning to herself and letting her hand roam lower, over 
Utena&#39;s stomach, which was moving in sync with her rhythm-
less breathing. She didn&#39;t need to unbutton Utena&#39;s jeans 
to slip her hand inside her pants and panties and graze 
into her pubic hair, which curled around her fingers.

 Utena had her problems with patience and Anthy&#39;s teasing 
was driving her op the wall. And she didn&#39;t want it any 
other way. All she could do in her frustration was to grab 
Anthy&#39;s elbow and push her arm further down her pants. 
Anthy finally showed mercy for her lover and let her 
fingers caress Utena&#39;s inner lips, which were wet and 
terribly hot.

 Without removing her lips from the nipple she was sucking 
on she let her finger part the hidden inner blossom and 
slowly wander upwards until it reached a bulb of flesh 
which made Utena&#39;s whole body jerk just by a slight 
caress.

 With a sigh that halfway turned into a moan Utena looked 
down at herself. Her view was obscured by an ocean of dark 
hair which descended from a well above her chest. What she 
could see rising from the ocean was one of her breasts, 
topped with her nipple, erect as it carved for attention. 
On the other side, deep within the depths of Anthy&#39;s mane 
she saw a pair of lips attending to the ignored nipple&#39;s 
twin.

 She wasn&#39;t sure if it was a good or bad idea, she wasn&#39;t 
sure if she&#39;d maybe regret her actions later, but she knew 
that this felt so damn good. Not just on a purely physical 
level. Looking at the lips that danced around her nipple 
and at the arm her hand was still pushing down her pants 
she felt like a child indulging in something it knew it 
would be scolded for. Like watching a late night movie 
that had some explicit scenes. Yeah, like that. The same 
sensations, the same excitement, just about hundred fold 
more intense.

 The pair of lips moving around Utena&#39;s nipple suddenly 
stopped and widened into a grin as the awareness of being 
watched struck. Utena looked up from the lips to catch 
Anthy&#39;s eye through the mane of dark hair. Anthy moved up 
from her place on her lover&#39;s chest towards her mouth, 
which was seductively glistening with wetness, like the 
other one Anthy couldn&#39;t see. Utena was about to moan as a 
hand resumed servicing where the pair of lips were busy 
before, but she was cut short as Anthy sucked herself onto 
her mouth.

 As Anthy&#39;s fingers slipped faster around her inner folds 
Utena had trouble keeping up with the sensuous dance of 
their tongues. Her body started to extricate itself from 
her control - her hips began countering Anthy&#39;s hand, her 
own hand wildly grabbing for something to get a better 
hold on. She even had trouble keeping up with her 
breathing. So, she just kept her breath and closed her 
eyes as her body moved wildly, chaotically. She felt 
herself grab for her lover and she latched herself to her, 
feeling the climax build up inside her. She felt it 
coming, from far off, but as she held her breath she felt 
her blood pumping wildly through her going faster and 
faster almost boiling until everything suddenly exploded 
but that was just the beginning while she felt her whole 
existence in fact the whole universe being sucked up 
inside of her right inside her belly to violently burst 
through her once again searing through her flesh and she 
found herself crashing down into the sofa panting and 
holding gripping Anthy as if her life depended on it.

 For quite a while Utena kept looking at the ceiling. Her 
breathing was shallow and every now and then, almost 
involuntarily, she took a deeper breath releasing it with 
a sigh. After some time she turned her head and gazed at 
Anthy who had been watching her in return. Utena blushed 
as their gazes met and she tried to smile bashfully.

 &quot;Why are you looking at me like that... It&#39;s 
embarrassing...&quot;

 &quot;You look very sexy, I can&#39;t help myself,&quot; Anthy replied. 
Utena lowered her gaze to avoid eye contact. She looked at 
Anthy&#39;s shirt that got damp at places from their sweat. 
The dark-haired woman&#39;s eyes widened in anticipation as 
Utena lifted her hand and moved it over her breast. Anthy 
was wearing a white sleeveless shirt and a long white 
skirt, both of which contrasted strongly with her dark 
skin. Well, at least until she pulled her shirt over her 
head. Utena smiled, more to herself really, staring at the 
two brown globes, gloriously displayed before her.

 &quot;You&#39;re exited,&quot; Utena said - surprising herself - in a 
voice that wasn&#39;t quite her own. But she grabbed the two 
ripe fruits in her hands nonetheless. Anthy kept her wide 
open eyes glued to Utena, anxiously awaiting the blonde&#39;s 
next moves. It looked wonderfully erotic as long feminine 
fingers caged two dark chocolate mounds, how a pink wet 
tongue played with a dark navel. Utena was fully aware of 
that as if watching through a different set of eyes. She 
grabbed a hold of the white skirt and seeing Anthy&#39;s eyes 
close in delight as she sunk under it.

 The strong scent in the dark world she found herself in 
made Utena&#39;s head dizzy, or at least that&#39;s what she told 
her self. In reality she knew her head was spinning 
because she was uncertain. And there were feelings - 
intense feelings - that were alien to her. Somehow they 
weren&#39;t her own.

 &quot;Utena...&quot; Anthy&#39;s desperate voice and a pair of hands on 
Utena&#39;s head made her realize that maybe this wasn&#39;t the 
best moment to dwell on those things. She was uncertain, 
yes, but she had made a decision and she will stick to it. 
With a smile on her face she didn&#39;t know was there she 
sunk her head all the way down into the grove between 
Anthy&#39;s legs.

 She started licking at the soft exposed flesh of pinkish 
inner lips in the midst of a neatly trimmed bush of dark 
pubic hair. Every lick extracted a moan or sigh from Anthy 
and made even Utena thrill. Soon enough she began to read 
Anthy&#39;s groans and movements, starting to truly pleasure 
her. Utena didn&#39;t see what her victim was doing but she 
imagined Anthy grabbing her breasts while pressing Utena 
between her legs.

 While Utena had been having some trouble relaxing Anthy 
didn&#39;t have any such problems. Shamelessly and 
unselfconsciously she presented herself to Utena, 
encouraged her with gasps and moans, which she didn&#39;t hold 
back and embraced her with long dark legs. Barely managing 
to breathe as she was pressed stubbornly into Anthy&#39;s 
garden, Utena understood how close to the edge of the 
abyss she already was. And with that her own exitement 
rose by a notch again.

 Utena tried to keep the wild purple-haired woman as close 
to the edge without actually pushing her over. Anthy was 
on her toes, pushing her crotch into Utena&#39;s face, lifting 
herself off the sofa, almost pulling Utena&#39;s hair out, 
tearing up the sofa with her other hand. Utena felt a 
surge of power rush through her as she kept Anthy right on 
the edge of this agonizing pleasure a few moments.

 And then the dark-skinned body suddenly short-circuited 
and jerked once. The various sounds Anthy emitted 
heightened into a crescendo of short gasps. Her legs 
locked strongly around Utena&#39;s throat, but shortly after 
released and spread wide, as if afraid of suffocating 
Utena. Utena used that moment to try to push her tongue 
into Anthy, but seeing as this didn&#39;t have any effect she 
licked upwards over the tip of the exposed little nipple. 
Which caused the pair of barnacles to snap back and a 
shriek to fill the room.

 Utena was forced to set a personal record in holding her 
breath until Anthy&#39;s body finally relaxed and fell into 
the sofa exhausted. She became totally limp as if all life 
had been drained from it. Her eyes were either closed or 
barely open and Utena felt anxious because she didn&#39;t know 
if she was being watched or not.

 Slowly Utena moved upward and hovered over Anthy. The 
listless body had meanwhile regained some life and her arm 
reached out wandered up Utena&#39;s thigh and made it&#39;s way up 
to her back. Her eyes watched Utena from below the almost 
closed eyelids seemingly in a trance, though it wasn&#39;t so. 
Resisting the urge to lie down or go to the bathroom or 
anything to escape this surreal situation, Utena kept 
looking at those haunting eyes that seemed to try to hide 
from her.

 She saw a woman that was willing to throw her life away, 
that tore down the very foundations on which she stood. A 
woman that revolutionized herself. Doing it to become the 
woman she is now, to be here now, to have Utena as part of 
her life. Utena didn&#39;t want to think about love, because 
it really was so much more than that. It was more like 
being yourself. And Utena bent down to kiss her.

--------------------------------------------------

 They dozed off shortly afterward, right there on the 
couch, half dressed, covered with some sheet that was 
within arm-reach. While Anthy was soon soundly sleeping, 
Utena was waking up every few minutes, tossing and turning 
carefully. That was quite understanding since she slept 
through the whole afternoon and her body was hurting in 
numerous places from the sofa.

 Within the next hour she got so frustrated she stubbornly 
stared at the ceiling and listened to the ticking of a 
clock somewhere. After another half hour, her bones were 
hurting so much she gently extracted herself from the sofa 
and Anthy&#39;s limbs.

 Her bones were cracking one after another as she 
stretched on the way to the bathroom. Looking at herself 
in the mirror she expected to see a horrible sleepy and 
trashed face but to her surprise she looked pretty normal. 
She looked exactly like she felt - wide awake. While 
washing her face and teeth she kept looking at the mirror 
for a while longer, thinking. Her mind was working and her 
thoughts were just flowing from subject to subject, from 
today&#39;s lunch to Anthy to today&#39;s... dessert. After she 
was done she removed the rest of her clothes and put on 
her bottom part of her pajamas. After looking very briefly 
for it and not finding it she left the to be where ever it 
was and left the bathroom bare-breasted.

 As Utena reentered she found Anthy propped up on her 
elbow, smiling at her. It was one of her self-satisfied 
smiles that most people seemed to confuse with a bimbo-
smile. But Utena didn&#39;t notice it as her gaze fell to 
Anthy&#39;s equally bare breasts. Utena&#39;s silhouette lingered 
in front of the bathroom doorway for a few more moments 
and then dissolved into the darkness that enveloped the 
room as the light was turned off.

 &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep after I slept almost the whole 
afternoon,&quot; Anthy heard Utena&#39;s voice in the darkness 
slowly coming closer. As her eyes adjusted Utena was 
already next to the sofa so she took her outstretched hand 
and pulled her down. Utena&#39;s bare back was now in front of 
her and she began running her fingers across it.

 &quot;You&#39;re shining again,&quot; she told her as Utena&#39;s torso was 
twisting and goose bumps were spreading all over it.

 &quot;Stop that,&quot; Utena answered with an &#39;aah&#39;. &quot;You&#39;re 
shining too, you know. That&#39;s what&#39;s different about you. 
You&#39;re shining much brighter. Let&#39;s go to bed, okay? 
Everything hurts me from this damn sofa.&quot; Then she 
suddenly turned her head and looked at Anthy over her 
shoulder. Both could see well now that their eyes 
adjusted. &quot;You did something to me before, didn&#39;t you? 
When we were... you know. I felt you in me, I felt your 
feeling flow through me.&quot;

 Anthy kept her smile that had creeped onto face and said 
calmly: &quot;I am a witch, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

 Utena&#39;s peaceful smile turned to steel and her eyes 
narrowd down to two long slits. &quot;Don&#39;t ever say that 
again.&quot; She stood up and headed for the bed with Anthy 
after her saying: &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

 Suddenly Utena turned back to her, her face changed back 
from the iron mask to her cheerful self again. &quot;What are 
we gonna do now?&quot; she asked. &quot;You know, I haven&#39;t thought 
about that at all.&quot;

 Anthy was puzzled herself as they sat down on the bed. 
Then she smiled. &quot;Now we are free.&quot;

 &quot;Free? Free to do what?&quot; Utena asked as she lay down on 
the bed.

 &quot;To do whatever we want,&quot; Anthy answered also laying 
down.

 &quot;Whatever?&quot; Utena said looking at Anthy. &quot;Free to go?&quot; 
Anthy returned the stare but didn&#39;t answer. She wanted 
Utena to say it out loud. &quot;Do you want to go?&quot; Utena 
finally said.

 Anthy smiled again. &quot;Free to stay,&quot; she answered, please. 
&quot;Now, nothing is forcing me to be by your side. Now I&#39;m 
free to stay by your side.&quot;

 Utena turned away and looked at the ceiling. &quot;Ah,&quot; she 
said, feeling quite stupid for saying it. She didn&#39;t know 
what else to say. Maybe she&#39;ll think of something 
tomorrow.
