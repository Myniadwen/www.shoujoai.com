<a href="../utena/sakura-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Today&#39;s parent/teacher day!&quot; Sakura said happily. &quot;Not only do we not 
have to work, but we find out today who Juri&#39;s been dating!&quot;

Tomoyo sweatdrops a bit at that. &quot;It&#39;s really been bugging you, hasn&#39;t 
it Sakura?&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;I hope we see my mom today, but she&#39;s 
not sure if she can get away from her business meetings.&quot;

&quot;Your parents are divorced, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Sakura asked. Tomoyo nodded. 
&quot;That must have been hard,&quot; Sakura finished sadly.

&quot;She&#39;s been happier since he was gone, honestly,&quot; Tomoyo answered with 
a cheerful smile. &quot;I&#39;m just glad she&#39;s started dating again. She even 
moved her headquarters to be nearer the school.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Sakura said admiringly. She looked over at the wall clock and 
jumped to her feet! &quot;Oh, the acting Chairwoman&#39;s speech! We&#39;ll be 
late!&quot;

&quot;You made it,&quot; Juri commented with a smile as the two panting and 
wheezing figures stumbled to a stop beside her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we saved 
your seats,&quot; Juri said smiling.

Sakura sat down between Juri and Tomoyo, catching her breath, when out 
of the blue she suddenly felt a spark. And again, a flash of 
incredible, yet familiar power. &quot;Juri, Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura said 
breathlessly, &quot;there&#39;s a Card nearby!&quot; Tomoyo instantly took her 
ever-present camera and slowly played it across the crowd.

&quot;Where?&quot; Tomoyo asked. A hand touched Sakura&#39;s shoulder, and Juri 
smiled down at her.

&quot;Trouble?&quot; Juri asked mildly.

&quot;We&#39;re not sure,&quot; Tomoyo answered quietly. Suddenly, there was a loud 
speaker crackle, and a figure stepped up to the microphone.

The vice-Principal adjusted his tie nervously. &quot;Uhm, welcome, 
everybody. Today is the parent/teacher day at Ohtori academy. But 
before the parents start arriving the Acting Chairwoman would like to 
say a few words.&quot; Two figures walked up to the platform, and Sakura 
felt her heart catch in her throat.

The young man was handsome, his long white hair framing elven 
features, and, strangely, he cradled what appeared to be a stuffed 
animal toy in his arms. But it was the woman that caught Sakura&#39;s eye: 
long brown hair framed a beautiful, intelligent face, and when the 
breeze blew just right, Sakura caught the scent of roses and cherry 
blossoms. &quot;It&#39;s her,&quot; Sakura whispered softly, &quot;the woman who saved me 
as a child. But how?&quot;

She adjusts the microphone, even as the young man behind her 
suspiciously scanned the audience. &#39;Is he some kind of bodyguard?&#39; 
Sakura wondered. &#39;But he seems so delicate!&#39;

&quot;Students, I&#39;m Kaho Mitsuki, and I&#39;m honored to be standing here 
today. My year of filling in for Kanae Ohtori will soon be over, as 
I&#39;m happy to announce she will be soon returning to her former post.&quot; 
She smiles at the cheering, looking out over the crowd, and Sakura 
almost feels her heart stop when her eyes meet Sakura&#39;s. &quot;I am very 
proud of you all,&quot; she said simply, keeping her gaze locked with 
Sakura. With that, the speech is over, and she and her companion are 
quickly gone.

&quot;Sakura, are you all right?&quot; Tomoyo asked the dazed girl. Sakura shook 
her head and smiled weakly, and Tomoyo felt her heart go out to her.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Sakura said, frowning. She spoke slowly &quot;She&#39;s the one who 
rescued me. And I&#39;m sure I feel a Card around her. But how?&quot;

Suddenly, an announcement blares loudly: &quot;Would Sakura Kinomoto and 
Company please report to the observatory? Sakura and Company, to the 
observatory, please.&quot;

&quot;I guess this is it,&quot; Sakura said softly.

&quot;I&#39;m going with you,&quot; Tomoyo said, before Sakura could say anymore. 
Sakura opened her mouth to argue, but saw iron resolve in her eyes. 
That, and something... more.

Juri spoke up, &quot;I&#39;m going too.&quot;

Sakura rubbed a large, throbbing &quot;x&quot; on her forehead. &quot;I have no idea 
how bad or crazy it&#39;s going to get this time...&quot; she started again.

&quot;If you don&#39;t let us go with you,&quot; Tomoyo said cheerfully, &quot;we&#39;ll just 
follow you anyway.&quot;

Sakura sighed and sweatdropped. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; she said, and 
smiled at her friends. The three walked together across the campus. 
Tomoyo plucked a white rose at the base of the tower, and 
ceremoniously put it in Sakura&#39;s breast pocket. She then leaned in and 
kissed Sakura lightly on the lips, then again, lingeringly.

&quot;For luck, Sakura,&quot; Tomoyo said softly. Sakura lingered a moment, lost 
in her eyes. They separate, and Sakura glared at the smirking Juri. 
They make their way up the stairs, finally coming to a stop just 
outside the observatory doors.

Sakura draws out the sword pendant, cups it in her hands, and speaks:

&quot;Oh Sword of Dios,

Power of magic, power of Right!

Surrender the Blade, the sword of Light!

Release!&quot;

Blade in hand, Sakura opens the door and leads her friends in. 
Suddenly, a figure sweeps down from above her, blade swinging. Sakura 
pushes Tomoyo back to Juri as she parries the blow, and he retreats 
above. &quot;Face the test of Yue!&quot; the white haired boy with wings cries, 
and swoops down at her again. Sakura casually steps aside, grabs a 
wing, and uses his momentum to slam him against a wall.

&quot;Passed,&quot; she says, as she slices his rose. A voice howls in rage, and 
Sakura spins to see a winged lion racing towards her. He claws at her 
frantically, but she rolls, shielding her rose, and manages to slash 
across the rose in his harness as well. The two opponents draw away, 
recovering a moment, then they kneel before her.

&quot;I, Yue, acknowledge you Sakura.&quot; the white haired, winged boy said.

&quot;And I, Kerberos, acknowledge you Sakura,&quot; the winged lion said in a 
deep, rumbling voice.

&quot;But now,&quot; a woman&#39;s voice said, &quot;you must make the final judgment.&quot; 
Kaho Mitsuki smiles as she emerges from the shadows, carrying a sword, 
a gray rose on her breast. &quot;A judgment on me,&quot; she finishes.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Sakura says, frowning.

&quot;I used you, Sakura,&quot; Kaho Mitsuki said quietly, &quot;with half truths and 
lies. I made you collect the cards, putting you and others,&quot; she looks 
at the two standing behind Sakura, &quot;in grave danger. Will you judge me 
and my deeds, Sakura?&quot;

Sakura charged suddenly, raced towards Ms Mitsuki, and swung her sword 
at her. A single cut, and the rose lies on the floor. &quot;You saved my 
life,&quot; Sakura said to her softly, &quot;I wanted to die that day, and I 
would have without you. I was drowning in despair over my family&#39;s 
death, and you gave me a reason to live.&quot;

Ms Mitsuki swayed a bit in front of her, then smiles. &quot;The final test 
is one of mercy, Sakura. You passed.&quot; Darkness and light both exploded 
out from her body, forming into twin figures before Sakura. Sakura 
raises the sword to bind them and sees a staff instead. &quot;You don&#39;t 
need to force them with a sword anymore, you only need to ask, 
mistress of the cards.&quot; Ms Mitsuki said with a small smile.

Sakura smiled back at her, then raised her staff and said &quot;Dark Card! 
Light Card! Return to your power confined! Dark and Light!&quot; The two 
cards form, and softly drop into her hands.

------------------------------------------------------------

Later, as the parents began to arrive, they talked outside. &quot;Where did 
Yue and Kerberos go?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;They guard the protector of the cards. For an age, that was me, but 
now, it&#39;s your turn. I believe they are taking on new forms to prepare 
for their service to you.&quot; Sakura tried to protest the word 
&#39;service&#39;, but Ms Mitsuki shushed her and pointed, as two beautiful 
young women dressed in boy&#39;s and girl&#39;s uniforms walked out of the 
tower, one pink haired, one purple haired. &quot;Kerberos,&quot; she said, 
nodding to the pink haired girl, &quot;Yue,&quot; nodding to the purple haired 
one. &quot;Will you take on new names to fit your new bodies?&quot;

The pink haired girl smiled and said &quot;I&#39;m Utena, and this,&quot; she said, 
looking down at the former Yue, &quot;is Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Sakura said angrily, startling the two of them. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said to the pair, then turns to Juri and says &quot;Juri, you 
said you&#39;d tell us who you&#39;re girlfriend was today!&quot; Ms. Mitsuki and 
Tomoyo sweatdropped, and Juri smiled.

&quot;Here she comes now,&quot; Juri said mildly, and pointed to a disturbance 
in the crowd.

Five female bodyguards firmly cleared the way for a beautiful woman 
with short sandy hair. &quot;Tomoyo!&quot; she cried happily, picking her up in 
a hug.

As soon as she let her down, Tomoyo pulled Sakura forward. &quot;Sakura, 
this is my mother, Sonomi.&quot; Sakura bowed nervously.

&quot;Very pleased to meet you.&quot; Sakura stuttered out.

&quot;And you. Are you Juri&#39;s friend?&quot; Sonomi asked.

Sakura looked at her blankly a moment. Then Juri stepped forward, and 
Sonomi pulled Juri into her arms.

&quot;Juri told me yesterday,&quot; Tomoyo said to the dumbfounded Sakura. She 
smiled at the stunned girl, then slowly pulled her into a kiss.

&quot;What was that for?&quot; Sakura asked rather breathlessly.

&quot;Preview for tonight.&quot; Tomoyo answered simply.

Sakura slowly smiled.
