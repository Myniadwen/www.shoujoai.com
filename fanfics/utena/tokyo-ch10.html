<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 10 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        &#39;It&#39;s interesting,&#39; Anthy thought to herself as she settled 
into the seat opposite the two ladies, &#39;how different they really 
are.&#39;

        Integra Hellsing gazed at Anthy coolly, her face almost 
unreadable as she studied her intently. On the other hand the blonde 
bodyguard&#39;s face was quite easily read, showing excitement, a bit of 
nervousness, and a great deal of caution.

        Integra got right down to business as she said to Anthy 
coolly, &quot;Up until a month ago I was receiving regular weekly reports 
from you. Now it seems I must come to you to keep informed of what&#39;s 
actually going on.&quot;

        Anthy was equally frank with her answer, &quot;Since becoming a 
vampire I was concerned there might be a conflict of interests.&quot;

        &quot;We have been known to employ vampires from time to time,&quot; 
Integra gave a tip of her head to her pale companion.

        Strangely, as soon as she head that Anthy was a vampire, the 
little blonde relaxed slightly, &quot;Victoria Ceres,&quot; she introduced 
herself simply.

        Anthy gave her a slight smile, then looked over at Integra. &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t aware that the Order operated in Tokyo,&quot; she said quietly.

        &quot;We&#39;ve received a formal request for assistance from the 
Japanese government,&quot; Integra said simply, &quot;regarding the situation in 
Tokyo itself.&quot; She gave Anthy a thoughtful look, &quot;A situation I 
suspect you know a great deal about.&quot;

        Anthy felt oddly comfortable slipping back into her roll of an 
agent reporting to her superior, &quot;We have a serious vampire problem. 
Not only are there growing numbers of rogue vampires but apparently 
several elder vampires are in the city...&quot;

        In another part of the city Utena shook her head with a sigh. 
Apparently Wakaba had taken courses in combat shopping or something, 
she was that good at it. Thankfully she was going for bargains, trying 
her best to stretch Utena&#39;s money.

        &quot;Cute!&quot; Shiori squealed, picking up a chibi-goth toy.

        The toy actually looked a bit like Utena, with pale skin, and 
pink hair. The only real problem with it was the black dress it was 
wearing. Wakaba spotted it too, and large throbbing hearts soon 
appeared in her eyes.

        &quot;We&#39;ve got to buy it,&quot; Wakaba agreed with Shiori.

        Both girl&#39;s swiftly turned their eyes to Utena and the taller 
woman sighed softly, knowing she was doomed. &quot;How much?&quot; Utena asked 
the shopkeeper.

        The pretty shopkeeper was looking up at Utena quite oddly 
before she softly said to her, &quot;For you, it&#39;s only half price.&quot;

        &quot;Are these things popular?&quot; Juri asked softly.

        &quot;You could say that, yes,&quot; the lady said softly as she took 
Utena&#39;s money from her. She carefully wrapped the doll up, then passed 
it over. Once Utena had left she quickly asked Juri, &quot;Was that Tenjou 
Utena?&quot;

        Juri looked down at the woman in honest surprise. &quot;How do you 
know that name?&quot; she asked her, her own voice coming out just a bit 
harsh.

        &quot;The doll&#39;s modeled after her,&quot; she shrugged, obviously not 
bothered by Juri&#39;s tone, &quot;though I have to tell my friend to put her 
in a boy&#39;s uniform the next time. Everybody in the city&#39;s underground 
knows the name of Tenjou Utena, the vampire protector of Tokyo.&quot;

        Juri sweatdropped. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she swiftly walked away.

        &quot;You have the oddest expression on your face,&quot; Utena noted as 
Juri caught up with her.

        &quot;Utena, you don&#39;t know the half of it,&quot; Juri said with a 
scowl. Speaking to her softly so that the cheerfully shopping pair of 
Shiori and Wakaba couldn&#39;t over hear she filled Utena in on what she 
had just heard about.

        &quot;They put me in a dress?&quot; Utena blurted.

        &quot;That&#39;s not my point,&quot; Juri sighed. &quot;If your name is that well 
known, why hasn&#39;t Mrs. Ohtori tracked you down already?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;She&#39;s playing a game, then,&quot; Utena said gravely. &quot;She wants 
me scared of her, hiding and wondering when she&#39;ll come for me,&quot; she 
mused.

        &quot;Which we&#39;ve been doing, more or less,&quot; Juri acknowledged.

        &quot;But not any longer,&quot; Utena said firmly. &quot;If she knows who I 
am hiding&#39;s useless anyway.&quot;

        &quot;Why not have a party?&quot; Wakaba popped up, starling them both.

        &quot;How does she do that?&quot; Juri growled.

        Utena just ignored that question entirely as she nodded 
thoughtfully, &quot;Yes, a party.&quot; Turning to look at Juri she said, &quot;I&#39;ll 
get a hold of Ayeka Kisaragi, find out what clubs in the city will 
serve vampires. We&#39;ll all go, us, Ruka, Anthy and all the groupies.&quot;

        &quot;You sure this is a good idea?&quot; Juri asked softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Utena admitted quietly, &quot;but I want to send a little 
message to Mrs. Ohtori.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;And it&#39;ll give the others a 
bit of a break, too.&quot; With a sigh she added, &quot;I just wish Anthy was 
back from her meeting.&quot;

        The bar was mostly deserted, and the waitress quite nervously 
delivered the next round of drinks. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Integra took a small 
drink from her scotch before asking Anthy, &quot;So how dangerous is this 
elder vampire?&quot;

        Anthy sighed while taking a sip of her spiked tomato juice, 
&quot;Still unknown. But her daughter was quite able to face off against 
two young vampires with relative ease, dominating the will of one so 
much that she simply collapsed.&quot;

        &quot;An impressive display of mental strength,&quot; Integra 
acknowledged.

        &quot;Her daughter,&quot; Victoria spoke up softly, &quot;do you mean this 
Mrs. Ohtori created her as a vampire, or do you mean biological 
daughter?&quot;

        &quot;Mrs. Ohtori has claimed that Kanae was her biological 
daughter,&quot; Anthy noted, &quot;but it hasn&#39;t been verified.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m somewhat reluctant to do so,&quot; Integra admitted, &quot;but I 
can contact the Watchers organization. They have records going back 
even farther than the Order does.&quot;

        &quot;I would deeply appreciate it,&quot; Anthy said respectfully.

        &quot;Now I&#39;m glad Walter insisted I take that cannon along,&quot; 
Victoria murmured. She smiled dangerously, &quot;I bet that could punch a 
hole even in Mrs. Ohtori.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope so,&quot; Anthy answered.

        &quot;And the other elder?&quot; Integra asked.

        &quot;Miyu,&quot; Anthy nodded, &quot;I faced her power myself. She is 
frighteningly powerful, so much so that I am quite dubious about 
antagonizing her...&quot;

        Saya walked up the shrine steps, her long dark hair flowing 
around her. The katana she carried in it&#39;s case, over her shoulder 
quite comfortably. She almost looked like any Japanese student dressed 
in her girl&#39;s uniform, except the oddness of her walking about so late 
at night.

        &quot;Miyu!&quot; she called out as Saya passed beneath the archway at 
the front of the shrine.

        &quot;You aren&#39;t going to try that again are you?&quot; the amused young 
woman&#39;s voice seemed to come from nowhere. Saya waited, and Miyu 
emerged from the shadows, garbed all in red with her skin glowing 
white like some ghost wandering from it&#39;s grave.

        &quot;Not today,&quot; Saya said simply.

        Larva hovered behind Miyu, the cloaked Shinma protectively 
standing watch over his lady. &quot;If you wish to attack her again,&quot; he 
said simply, &quot;you will have to face me.&quot;

        Saya gave him a respectful nod. Respectful, but without fear. 
&quot;Not today,&quot; Saya repeated in a soft drawl, &quot;but someday, I may take 
you up on that.&quot;

        Miyu felt Larva rearing up indignantly behind her and swiftly 
spoke up, &quot;What can I do for you tonight, Saya?&quot;

        &quot;The newcomer vampires in the city,&quot; Saya said to Miyu simply, 
&quot;I understand that you&#39;ve encountered them.&quot;

        &quot;Ohtori,&quot; Miyu nodded slightly, &quot;and Tenjou Utena.&quot; She looked 
over at Saya curiously, &quot;Do you intend to hunt them?&quot;

        &quot;Does it matter?&quot; Saya asked softly.

        &quot;I suppose not,&quot; Miyu acknowledged. &quot;What about them do you 
wish to know?&quot;

        &quot;Their names are enough,&quot; Saya said to her softly, &quot;I could 
already sense them. But it&#39;s always easier if I have a name.&quot; The 
vampire left silently, walking down the steps and disappearing into 
the darkness of night.

        Softly Larva asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you concerned for Utena?&quot;

        Miyu&#39;s smile was grim, &quot;If Utena cannot survive against Saya, 
she is not what I hope she might be. And Saya could choose to pursue 
Ohtori first.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s a gamble,&quot; Larva murmured.

        Integra&#39;s eyes had closed as she was listening, then opened to 
gaze across the table at Anthy, &quot;Thank you for the information.&quot;

        Anthy rose, &quot;I need to return to my friends.&quot;

        &quot;Understood,&quot; Integra nodded slightly as she too stood. &quot;We&#39;ll 
be in Tokyo for a while,&quot; she said softly, &quot;call us, if you need 
assistance.&quot;

        &quot;And will that assistance cost me?&quot; Anthy asked softly.

        &quot;The way of the world,&quot; Victoria smiled slightly.

        Anthy smiled slightly, &quot;True. I&#39;ll see you again, I think.&quot; 
With that, the young woman turned and walked away, leaving the bar 
silently.

        &quot;Should I follow her?&quot; Victoria asked softly.

        &quot;I doubt you could,&quot; Integra smiled, &quot;Anthy was one of my 
better students.&quot; She drew a cigar out and lit it, drawing on it 
deeply, &quot;And I think she will come back on her own.&quot;
