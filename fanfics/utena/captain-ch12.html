<h1>Captain of the Guard (part 12 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/captain-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Kanae restlessly paced the secluded corner hallway, impatiently 
waiting for him to arrive. Finally, he came down the hall, his long 
green hair flowing behind him.

&quot;You called. m&#39;lady?&quot; Saionji asked her curtly.

&quot;Our lord has called a meeting,&quot; Kanae said to him softly, &quot;for 
tonight. Get together as many of the others as you can, and bring them 
to the regular place.&quot;

Saionji stiffened, &quot;Of course. Is it time to move, then?&quot;

&quot;He grows concerned about what the Princess knows,&quot; Kanae answered, 
&quot;and is considering our next action.&quot; She paused before adding, &quot;Be 
ready.&quot; The woman turned, her own pale green hair swinging, and was 
gone.

Saionji watched her go silently, before leaving on his own errand. Not 
long after they were gone, a figure emerged from the shadows.

&quot;Well, well, well. Wasn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Wakaba smiled, and took 
off to report what she had heard to Utena.

------------------------------------------------------------

Utena cradled her sword between her hands, and she frowned in deep 
concentration. Light began to shimmer all along the blade, around the 
hilt, and then it suddenly expanded outwards. Etched in silvery light 
the spirit stood, a noble and heroic man.

&quot;Utena.&quot; Dios smiled, tipping his head to her. He turned to Anthy and 
executed a more formal bow, &quot;M&#39;lady, I am Dios.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to meet you at last,&quot; Anthy smiled at him. She added, &quot;I 
hope that Utena&#39;s summoning you hasn&#39;t been inconvenient.&quot;

&quot;The pleasure is all mine,&quot; Dios smiled, &quot;and the pleasure of meeting 
such a noble lady far outweighs any inconvenience.&quot;

A smiling Anthy looked over at Utena as she said impishly, &quot;You could 
take a few lessons in manners from him.&quot;

Utena decided just to let that comment pass. &quot;Thank you for answering 
my call, Dios,&quot; she smiled at him. Growing more serious, &quot;The evil I 
told you about that was threatening the princess, we&#39;ve discovered 
it&#39;s source.&quot;

Dios nodded, &quot;Then what are we waiting for?&quot; Loudly, he then declared, 
&quot;Let us go smite this evil at once!&quot;

&quot;We have allies coming to assist us,&quot; Anthy smiled at the energetic 
young man, &quot;and we must wait a short time for them to be gathered.&quot;

Dios looked a bit sheepish, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, m&#39;lady. Occasionally my thirst 
for battle can nearly overwhelm me.&quot; He frowned slightly, &quot;You do not 
normally call my spirit forth, Utena. What has caused this most 
unusual of acts?&quot;

A grim smile, and Utena said, &quot;Our foes are led by a dark spirit of 
some kind, so I may need your aide to face him in the test of arms.&quot;

Dios smiled, &quot;My aide is yours, Utena. Merely call out my name in the 
crucible of battle, and I will answer to face the dark one.&quot; His form 
gradually faded away, until the outline was all that was left, then he 
was simply gone.

Utena slid the sword into it&#39;s hilt with a steely rasp. &quot;Now all we 
need is Wakaba and the others to find them...&quot; A banging on the door 
interrupted her. Utena waved Anthy to stay in her seat and cautiously 
opened the door!

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba squealed happily, hugging her madly. Anthy began 
to laugh as Utena struggled to get free of her grip.

&quot;Easy, Wakaba!&quot; Utena managed to get out, adding, &quot;I like being able 
to breathe.&quot;

&quot;Any luck?&quot; Anthy asked Wakaba with a smile.

&quot;They are meeting tonight,&quot; Wakaba confirmed, &quot;and they&#39;re doing it in 
the great hall.&quot;

&quot;The sheer arrogance of the man,&quot; Utena whispered, clearly surprised. 
She smiled grimly, &quot;He&#39;ll regret that, later.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll make him regret it tonight,&quot; Juri said from the doorway. Behind 
her several guards waited, and among them was an unexpected face.

&quot;Miki?&quot; Utena blinked. &quot;This isn&#39;t going to be an easy fight,&quot; she 
cautioned the scholar, &quot;maybe you should...&quot; she trailed off, as both 
Juri and Anthy had begun to laugh.

&quot;You didn&#39;t tell her?&quot; Miki asked Juri.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think it was my place,&quot; Juri shrugged.

Miki rolled his eyes before looking at Utena, &quot;Before I was a 
courtier, I was a guard.&quot; He blushed a bit as he explained, &quot;I just 
discovered that I preferred to fight my battles with my words, rather 
than a sword.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;s still the best fighter I know with the rapier,&quot; Juri smiled.

Tsuwabuki flipped one of his throwing blades into the air, catching it 
smoothly. &quot;Glad to be of service,&quot; the young man smiled.

Shiori made her way through the guards to stand by Juri&#39;s side. 
Instead of her normal dresses, she wore her formal mage&#39;s robes, a 
long cape swirling behind her. Around her neck is a band of protective 
charms, and a soft light danced around her.

&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Shiori said seriously. She grinned suddenly, surprising 
them as she added, &quot;And I&#39;ve prepared a special surprise for our dear 
Kanae.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go overboard,&quot; Utena cautioned her.

Shiori batted her eyes at her. &quot;Don&#39;t you trust me?&quot; she asked 
sweetly.

Utena rolled her eyes, muttering, &quot;I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.&quot;

Shiori noticed the alarmed expression Juri was getting and said 
quietly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. We always do this before battle.&quot;

Juri reached over to gently clasp Shiori&#39;s hand in hers. &quot;Well, I 
trust you,&quot; she said to Shiori with a comforting smile.

Wakaba looked over at the water-clock and quietly said, &quot;I think it&#39;s 
about time.&quot;

Utena closed her eyes, and something to change about her. She opened 
her eyes, and they glittered dangerously even as she stood up 
straighter. The others all responded to it, looking at her 
attentively. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said simply.

The group set off down the hallways, with Utena taking the lead. The 
few minor nobles or servants they encountered may have had questions, 
but one look at Utena&#39;s forbidding expression quickly silenced them.

They reached the main doors, and Utena pressed her ear to them to 
hear. Conversation was faint, but they could tell there was a fair 
number of people there. Utena closed her eyes, &quot;I count at least ten, 
including Kanae, Touga and Saionji.&quot;

Juri smiled bleakly, &quot;Touga&#39;s mine.&quot;

&quot;Miss Kanae and I are going to have a little chat,&quot; Shiori grinned 
ferally.

Miki sighed, &quot;Then I guess I get Saionji. Let&#39;s hope he&#39;s as good as 
he says he is, or this is going to be a short fight.&quot;

Anthy looked a bit startled to hear her secretary sound so blood 
thirsty. She raised a mace in her hands, &quot;The nobles won&#39;t know what 
hit them.&quot;

Utena winced visibly at that, silently signaling the guards to keep an 
eye on her. &quot;I&#39;ll be going right for Akio,&quot; Utena said grimly. &quot;Juri 
and I will take point. Watch out for each other in there,&quot; she said to 
them all quietly.

------------------------------------------------------------

Touga made his way through the small group of nobles to reach Saionji, 
before looking at him curiously. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked him 
quietly.

&quot;Utena and the Princess interviewed Kanae earlier today,&quot; Saionji told 
him quietly, &quot;and I think they spooked her.&quot;

&quot;Do you think they know?&quot; Touga asked.

&quot;They... suspect,&quot; Saionji admitted. &quot;But they don&#39;t know enough to 
act,&quot; he smiled, &quot;and before they do, we&#39;ll be ready to strike.&quot;

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right,&quot; Touga answered quietly.

Before Saionji could form a reply, the subject of their conversation 
arrived. Kanae and Akio walked in to the brightly lit hall together, 
standing tall and proud.

&quot;Welcome, friends,&quot; Akio said with a sneer.

Touga blinked, noticing something odd. Kanae&#39;s hand wasn&#39;t resting on 
Akio&#39;s arm, instead she held it just above it. She smiled as she 
looked the crowd over, &quot;At last, it&#39;s time to carry out our great 
plan&#39;s next step.&quot;

&quot;Touga Kiryuu!&quot; Akio called him, and Touga walked forward steadily.

&quot;How can I be of service?&quot; Touga asked.

Akio seemed to accept such service as his due. &quot;That troublesome 
captain has become quite the thorn in our side,&quot; he admitted, &quot;and I 
have decided that it is time for that thorn to be plucked.&quot; A grim 
smile, &quot;That glorious task falls to you.&quot;

Touga looked at him, and realized something simple, yet quite 
profound. &#39;He&#39;s scared of her,&#39; he realized. &quot;I&#39;m honored, my lord,&quot; 
Touga hesitated, &quot;but couldn&#39;t one of your great power accomplish this 
far more easily than one such as I?&quot;

Akio scowled as he asked dangerously, &quot;Are you questioning me?&quot; He 
took a step forward, and Touga quickly gave way.

As Akio moved, Touga saw something decidedly strange. &#39;His feet aren&#39;t 
touching the ground,&#39; he blinked, taking another cautious look to be 
sure.

But before anything more could be said, the doors of the hall were 
suddenly forced open! The sound echoed through the hall as they 
whirled in shock to see who stood there.

Tenjou Utena leveled her sword at them, her expression grave. &quot;Yield, 
or face the consequences,&quot; she said simply.

&quot;How did... ?!&quot; Saionji stuttered.

Utena smiled slightly, and Touga saw Akio grow pale. &quot;Akio the 
Bastard,&quot; she said, her voice dangerously smooth, &quot;we meet at last.&quot;
