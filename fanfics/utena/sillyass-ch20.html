<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 20 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Motoko Aoyama stood there calmly, sword ready as the
breeze stirred her long black hair, her white robes
flowing in the wind. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she finally
asked, the rose signet of a duelist glowing on her
finger, a single red rose attached to her robes.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Saionji answered her contemptuously, long
green hair tied back, a matching rose waiting for
battle. The object, of course, was for one of the
duelists to cut away the rose, ideally without hurting
the other fighter.

&quot;Good,&quot; Motoko smiled and seemed to disappear.

&quot;What in the...&quot; Saionji looked around wildly.

&quot;BOULDER CUTTING BLADE!&quot; Motoko struck without
warning, sending him and what was left of his rose
flying into the air.

&quot;Aieee!&quot; Saionji disappeared off in the distance.

&quot;So why did she have to get into a fight with him
again?&quot; a smiling Naru Narusegawa asked the others,
her brown hair falling in two curved strands in front
of her face as she munched from the tub of popcorn
they were sharing on the sidelines.

&quot;He insulted Shinobu,&quot; Keitaro Urashima answered
wryly, his square glasses gleaming, &quot;and made her cry.
As you may have noticed, that annoys Motoko.&quot; He
sneaked some popcorn himself, sitting close to his
girlfriend.

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Mitsune Konno smirked, the
impish look on her face more than justifying her
nickname Kitsune. Her short dirty blonde hair was a
new development, as was the touch of makeup she had
begun to wear lately.

&quot;Honor is satisfied,&quot; Motoko said somberly as she
walked back, Shinobu Maehara walking by her side
dressed in a long, formal gown. She looked at the
younger girl and smiled slightly, &quot;Thank you for being
my Rose Bride, Shinobu.&quot;

Shinobu blushed charmingly, the younger lady looking
up at Motoko adoringly. &quot;Thank you, sempai,&quot; she said,
her own short black hair slightly messed by the
breeze..

&quot;Not too bad at all,&quot; Kitsune nodded her agreement as
Motoko neared. She smoothly got up from where the
group had been waiting for her by the side of the
circular dueling arena and asked Motoko, &quot;Are you
planning to continue dueling?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Motoko shook her head gracefully, &quot;it&#39;s not
necessary and there is no reason for me to challenge
the champion, Tenjou Utena.&quot; She smiled slightly
adding, &quot;Besides I have no wish to be wedded to the
Rose Bride.&quot;

&quot;W-W-Wedded!&quot; Shinobu blushed charmingly.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Keitaro&#39;s cheeks went red as he considered that
idea.

&quot;Hentai,&quot; Naru hammered him relexedly.

The group trooped down the winding staircase, talking
together softly. &quot;So where is Su anyway?&quot; Motoko asked
them curiously.

Kitsune smirked, &quot;Either hanging with the Motor and
Mecha club or helping out the group of crazies to fix
the reality blending that dumped us all here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d still like to know how our world got pulled into
all of this chaos,&quot; Shinobu ventured the question
shyly.

&quot;I&#39;m tempted to blame it on something Su built,&quot;
Keitaro sighed, &quot;but in all honestly I think it was
just random chance.&quot;

&quot;At least you&#39;re making a killing renting out the
spare rooms at the Hinata girl&#39;s dorm,&quot; Kitsune said
to them cheerfully, &quot;and I&#39;m making a killing working
along with Nabiki and Ayaka on our various business
ventures.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d still like to know how the combination compact
disk of Naru&#39;s songs and the Sword and Flower
recordings got released,&quot; Motoko frowned.

Kitsune looked purely innocent as she batted her eyes
and sweetly said, &quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re taking
about.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Naru puffed out once they finally
reached bottom. She took a second to catch her breath
as she moaned, &quot;What sort of idiot designed this
without an elevator?&quot;

Elsewhere in Ohtori academy Akio Ohtori sneezed
suddenly.

The dueling forest was a peaceful oasis of greenery as
they walked outside together, the group of young
people going their separate ways once they reached the
school grounds. Keitaro raced off to join his mentor
Seta as they searched for any turtle civilization
ruins buried beneath Ohtori, Naru headed off to her
tutoring courses and Shinobu went to help with the
cooking stand she was running with several of the
other cooking-inclined girls.

&quot;I hope all of this hasn&#39;t messed things up for you
too badly,&quot; Kitsune commented as she and Motoko
continued on together.

The taller woman smiled slightly, her expression
serene. &quot;I&#39;m considering it a well deserved vacation
from my law courses,&quot; Motoko admitted with a slight
smile. She looked over at Kitsune, &quot;And how is it,
being the manager of Cafe Hinata?&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Kitsune smiled impishly, &quot;it&#39;s all right. I&#39;m
just very careful to let Shinobu do all the cooking
and everything works out by itself.&quot;

Motoko gave her a shrewd glance, &quot;And I suppose your
business skills have nothing to do with the profit the
cafe is running, according to Mutsumi.&quot;

&quot;The Turtle Lady has a big mouth,&quot; Kitsune said to her
wryly, mentally envisioning the good natured Mutsumi
Otohime.

&quot;What&#39;s this I hear,&quot; Motoko&#39;s voice, surprisingly,
had a slight edge to it, &quot;about all the young people
hanging around the cafe?&quot;

Kitsune looked over at Motoko in surprise, but the
other woman had an enviable poker face and was giving
away nothing. &quot;I think that the word&#39;s gotten around
that Mutsumi is single,&quot; she said to her wryly, &quot;not
to mention Shinobu.&quot;

The breath that Motoko puffed out on hearing that
could almost have been in relief as she quietly said,
&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;

&#39;Well, isn&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Kitsune found herself
thinking. Other than an very ill-fated crush on
Keitaro Motoko hadn&#39;t done much of any dating, and
more than one person at the Hinata girl&#39;s dorm had
wondered if she might be romantically interested in
other girls. &#39;Not to mention that little incident with
Kanako,&#39; she recalled.

&quot;Are you going to be working tonight?&quot; Motoko asked
Kitsune softly once they reached the central school
buildings.

&quot;I&#39;m just working this afternoon, Mutsumi is handling
things tonight,&quot; Kitsune smiled as she laughed, &quot;thank
god.&quot;

Motoko actually looked sheepish as she asked, &quot;Would
you mind if we went to the student council party
together?&quot;

Kitsune smiled as she said teasingly, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll have
to check my schedule, see if anyone is booked up for
tonight, you know how it is...&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Motoko smiled back a bit tentatively.

Kitsune reached out to gently take Motoko&#39;s hand, &quot;I&#39;d
love to go.&quot;

Motoko actually blushed and again Kitsune was reminded
at how inexperienced the other woman was. A sheltered
upbringing and a almost monk-like school life hadn&#39;t
really prepared Motoko for romance of any kind,
especially one that didn&#39;t necessarily meet the norm.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll pick you up at the cafe after work,&quot; Motoko
smiled before all but fleeing, Kitsune chuckling
softly as she watched her go.

That evening Motoko surprised her by arriving in long
pants and a simple sweater, her stance oddly relaxed
compared to her normal attitude. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she
smiled, seemingly unaware of the admiring glances she
was drawing.

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Kitsune pulled off her apron, glad
that she had changed into one of her nicer dresses
before coming to work.

&quot;Have a good time on your date!&quot; Mutsumi waved
enthusiastically, drawing everyone&#39;s attention.

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Motoko blushed furiously even as Kitsune
laughed, the two of them heading out into the
twilight.

&quot;You can be so focused and direct in your training and
school,&quot; Kitsune gently commented as they walked
together after a lovely dinner, &quot;but so tentative in
other things.&quot;

Motoko kept Kitsune close as they navigated the
carnival atmosphere of Ohtori academy at night,
looming protectively as needed for her lovely
companion. &quot;I suppose so,&quot; she admitted as they
stopped by one of the bridges, the moo shining down at
them, &quot;what would you suggest I do about it, though?&quot;

&quot;If it was me,&quot; Kitsune moved close to Motoko,
silently praying she wasn&#39;t making a mistake, &quot;I&#39;d do
something like this.&quot; Not hesitating she pressed their
bodies close as she kissed Motoko, a chaste but far
from friendly kiss.

&quot;Wow,&quot; a fiercely blushing Motoko managed, meeting
Kitsune&#39;s eyes with a broad smile.

&quot;And?&quot; Kitsune raised an eyebrow challengingly.

And Motoko drew Kitsune into a kiss even more intense
than the one before...

Author&#39;s Notes: This episode is set sometime after the
end of the Love Hina manga series. At that point
Mutsumi, Kitsune and Shinobu are running the Hinata
Cafe, Motoko is at Tokyo U studying law and Naru and
Keitaro finally tied the knot. The CD that is
mentioned refers to an episode of Love Hina where Naru
became an Idol Star and Motoko and Shinobu became a
girl&#39;s uniform pair called Sword and Flower. Other
characters in this episode are Ayaka from Phantom
Quest Corp, Nabiki from Ranma 1/2 and the usual group
of Utena characters.
