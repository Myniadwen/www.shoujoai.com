<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Out in the Night.

        It was night in Tokyo, and the vampires walked in the shadows. 
Vampires, and those that chose to hunt them down.

        The vampire walked inside, his hair styled and clothes neatly 
pressed as he stalked the smoky darkness of the bar. A smile, a 
lingering glance, he moved through the crowds unnoticed, picking out 
what he wanted. The girl was alone, quietly finishing her drink. Not 
too terribly attractive, and no one would likely miss her.

        &quot;Hello,&quot; he smiled at her.

        &quot;H... hi,&quot; she stuttered out shyly.

        &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be sitting here all alone,&quot; he smiled 
charmingly, &quot;there&#39;s all sorts of people out tonight. You could be 
hurt.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; she blushed, looking down.

        The charming, gentle words continued on as he carefully worked 
his wiles on her. She relaxed more and more, her smile becoming far 
less tentative as she came to enjoy his presence. When he thought she 
was ready, he made his move.

        He took her had gently tugging, &quot;Would you like to join me 
outside?&quot;

        Her eyes widened, and she smiled up at him happily. Just a bit 
tipsy from her drink she sighed out softly, &quot;Oh, I&#39;d love to.&quot;

        They smoothly made their way through the crowds, may of the 
patrons giving envious glances to the woman at snagging such a 
handsome man. The back door opened out into an alley, often used to 
off-load beer and other kinds of alcohol.

        The vampire looked around him curiously before smiling 
slightly. &quot;No one&#39;s here,&quot; he smiled, showing a bit of fang, &quot;we&#39;re 
all alone.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; the quite cold voice said, &quot;that requires less 
explanations.&quot;

        He turned back to her and found the young woman&#39;s stance was 
totally different than it was. There were no signs of her being drunk 
at all, instead the dark haired woman stood up straight, her eyes 
intent upon him. She drew something out from a hidden corner of the 
alley, and there was a sudden rasp of steel sliding on steel.

        &quot;What&#39;s going on..&quot; The vampire blinked, sounding confused.

        The girl moved like a shot, and the vampire howled in blazing 
pain as the sword the girl carried made a shining arc across his 
forearm. He clutched at the bloody stump, realizing that he had barely 
evaded a strike aimed at his head! She attacked him again and again, 
sending him scrambling to try to get away from her relentless assault.

        &quot;Hold still,&quot; she growled out, &quot;and it&#39;ll end quicker.&quot;

        He stumbled, coming to rest against a brick wall. His eyes 
widened, he turned around, and the shining path of the sword was the 
last sight he ever saw.

        The body slid wetly to the floor, the woman using her foot to 
stop the bouncing head from rolling away from her. &quot;Decapitation 
works,&quot; Saya murmured softly, &quot;even against these third generation 
half breeds.&quot;

        Saya cleaned the sword smoothly before sliding the katana away 
with a steely rasp. Then she mussed her clothes up a bit, trying to 
make it look like she had just had sex.

        &quot;Time to go back to trolling for idiot vampires,&quot; Saya 
muttered irritably before she headed back inside the bar.

        Not that she really minded hunting such fools. Privately, she 
thought of removing them as a public service to the reputation of more 
capable vampires everywhere. But they were easy prey, barely worth the 
effort of drawing forth her blade.

        As Saya settled into her corner seat she smiled. There were 
rumors of an elder vampire in the city, a creature of fearsome power. 
And a youngling, who seemed to be able to easily best her sires. If 
those rumors were true, it could make things very... interesting. Very 
interesting, indeed.

        The private plane slowly rolled to a stop in the darkness of 
the airport. The runway was on the far end of the airport, away from 
any of the commercial traffic or passenger&#39;s prying eyes. Unmarked 
except for a simple identification number, the older plane carried no 
company insignia, looking to be entirely unnoticeable.

        The hatch on the side folded down into stairs, then a single 
figure dressed in military garb stepped down, looking around her 
cautiously. The small young woman was pale, her short cropped blonde 
hair framing her face. A face, it should be said, looking very 
displeased.

        &quot;I hate flying,&quot; Victoria Ceres growled softly, &quot;I really, 
really hate it.&quot;

        &quot;Couldn&#39;t be helped,&quot; the taller woman answered, following her 
down. She wore a tasteful gray suit, her own silvery hair providing a 
ice contrast. Glasses gleamed on a face that could almost be described 
as handsome, and she drew on a cigar thankfully.

        &quot;Yes, Ms. Hellsing,&quot; Victoria gave the woman a respectful nod. 
Softly she added, &quot;At least it was a night flight all the way.&quot;

        Integra Hellsing smiled slightly, &quot;Least I could do.&quot;

        Victoria looked around them, her expression grave. &quot;Why 
couldn&#39;t we bring Arucard along?&quot; she asked her quietly.

        &quot;Walter can keep an eye on him,&quot; Integra answered. &quot;For this 
mission we may require some delicacy, a talent that Arucard rather 
lacks,&quot; she added.

        &quot;What is the mission?&quot; Victoria asked quietly.

        &quot;The Japanese government is growing concerned over the vampire 
problem in Tokyo, they fear their internal bodies may not be able to 
deal with it,&quot; Integra said quietly.

        &quot;So they want the Royal Order of Holy Knights assistance,&quot; 
Victoria murmured. She gave her superior a shrewd glance, &quot;But you 
didn&#39;t need to come along just for that.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve recently had less contact with one of my... more 
informal agents. She was based in Japan, and had been sending me 
reports quite regularly, but now they have slowed to a mere trickle,&quot; 
Integra quietly explained.

        &quot;You&#39;re worried about her?&quot; Victoria raised her eyebrow in 
surprise.

        &quot;That,&quot; Integra agreed, &quot;and concerned she might have been 
compromised.&quot;

        &quot;And if she had been compromised?&quot; Victoria asked.

        &quot;Then we&#39;ll take the necessary steps,&quot; Integra said coldly.

Authors Notes: Saya is from the movie Blood the last vampire. Victoria 
Ceres and Integra Hellsing are from the anime series, Hellsing. I had 
considered featuring Arucard as well, but he&#39;s a bit too blood 
thirsty, even for me.
