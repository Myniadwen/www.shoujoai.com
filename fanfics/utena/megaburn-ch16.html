Nene Romanova took a steadying breath, the blonde
officer looking over her troops then out past the
barricade. Boomers writhed and staggered forward,
bodies morphing wildly as they progressed along the
street towards their position, seemingly oblivious to
any possible danger.

&quot;Fire!&quot; Nene roared and they opened up, tossing out
high density slugs that tore through boomer flesh like
paper, ripping into artificial flesh and shattering
bones. Finally they slowed, then stopped... but there
were more behind them.

Lisa Valente raced up, the dusky skinned blonde
puffing softly. &quot;The evacuation is complete, we&#39;re
clear,&quot; she gasped.

Nene smiled down at her, gently supporting the young
woman as she looked around her at her half dozen
troops. &quot;All right,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;fall back to
the next barrier. The more time we buy, the more
people can be saved.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; the officers chorused as they moved out,
laying suppression fire down on the coming Boomers as
they did so.

Nene shivered faintly at that, unused to the new
position she found herself in. The attack on AD Police
headquarters had killed most of the higher ranking
officers, the few left like Daley were out of town or
otherwise unavailable. That put her firmly in the
hotseat, commanding the surviving AD Police as they
fought to protect citizens and beat back the Boomers.

&#39;I&#39;m just glad Mackie is out of danger,&#39; Nene thought
as she ran.

In a secured apartment within the Knight Saber&#39;s
headquarters Mackie Stingray worked away, the young
man&#39;s brow hair falling into his eyes. A human-boomer
hybrid he had to concentrate to resist the siren call
the rest of the Boomers had fallen prey to, but he was
managing. Now his priority was hacking the data-nets
of the criminal organizations.

&quot;Let&#39;s see, the system designer was Alec Williams, he
has a daughter Heather, a cat named Hikaru and a dog
called Spot and a guppy...&quot; Mackie murmured as he
tried out each word as a possible password.

Designers often left in private backdoors to keep
access in to systems they had created, and like most
people they used names or words that were familiar and
easy to remember to them for their passwords. The
trick, of course, was deducing what word or grouping
of words the designer used and in what combination.

*Bing!*

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Mackie grinned, accessing the
subdirectories. With a speed that would have made most
hackers die of envy he raced through the files,
searching for the hidden caches of data that he
wanted. It helped that he had a rough idea of what he
was looking for, due to Nene&#39;s people forwarding
certain files to him.

After a few moments certain familiar names began to
come up, as well as maps of Megatokyo. His eyes
widened as he saw the scope of their initial moves,
and soon realizing that the whole armed insurrection
was primarily a distraction for their real plan.

&quot;So what are they up to?&quot; Mackie murmured as he dug
deeper.

Mackie used up several more passwords as he went,
finally reaching the company president&#39;s personal
files which he opened without a moment&#39;s hesitation.
He scanned the data then froze before re-reading it
just to be sure. Mechanically he copied the
information to disk, his expression distant as he
tried to digest it all.

&quot;NERV,&quot; Mackie muttered in disbelief, &quot;they&#39;re after
the technology left in NERV.&quot;

Once upon a time Megatokyo had been defense city
Tokyo-3, part of a larger plan to protect Earth from a
alien invasion. That war ended, finally, and Tokyo-3
was phased over to civilian use, and eventually the
NERV facilities below it had been closed down and
sealed off. Now few if any of the residents even
remembered NERV or the alien threat, something that
the powers that be were quite willing to let continue.

At the time NERV&#39;s bio-tech and computer designs had
been bleeding-edge technology, and even now it was
probably competitive with almost anything available.
If someone could get ahold of even fragmentary data
they could reverse engineer innovations out of it,
then sell that technology to the highest bidder.

&quot;Those greedy bastards,&quot; Mackie got up, the black
haired man getting up, pocketing the data disk then
grabbing the synthetic leather jacket Priss had given
him. The jacket looked real, but in fact the armor
cloth could stop bullets and high powered slugs, too.

It took nearly ten minutes in his jeep to reach the AD
Police defense positions, ten harrowing minutes
dodging Boomers and mercenaries as well as having to
use his pistol and enhanced strength. He didn&#39;t like
using either, really, it reminded him of his inhuman
origins, but in a time like this there was no other
choice.

&quot;Incoming civilian.&quot; Officer Yukari yelled, the young
man firing his rifle into a Boomer.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Nene started then did a double take as she
saw who it was.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, ma&#39;am?&quot; Lisa asked her boss
tentatively.

&quot;That&#39;s not a civilian, that&#39;s my husband,&quot; Nene
sighed as Mackie drove his jeep right over a Boomer,
bouncing to a halt not far from their lines.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Lisa blurted, looking at the younger man in
shock.

Mackie made his was forward and smiled as charmingly
at Nene as he could. &quot;I promise there&#39;s a really good
explanation for me coming here,&quot; he said.

&quot;There better be,&quot; Nene tried to sound stern then she
folded him into a hug. Softly she added, &quot;I&#39;m so glad
you&#39;re all right.&quot;

Lisa watched the display a bit uncomfortably a moment
then said hesitantly, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I hate to interrupt
but....&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nene pulled back reluctantly. She smiled at
Mackie, &quot;So what was so important you had to break
cover?&quot;

Mackie pulled out the disk, &quot;I know what they&#39;re
after.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Lisa blurted.

&quot;You know that hacker I had you include on the books,
the one I wouldn&#39;t name?&quot; Nene nodded towards Mackie,
&quot;That&#39;s him.&quot;

Lisa&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;The mystery cracker?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Mackie blushed.

Cutting off the hero worship before it could start
Nene asked, &quot;What have you got, love?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re after NERV,&quot; Mackie revealed, &quot;they want the
technology buried there, including details on the
Evangelion and Magi.&quot;

&quot;I thought Evangelion was a myth,&quot; Lisa breathed out.

&quot;Government disinformation campaign,&quot; Nene said
flatly, &quot;they couldn&#39;t actually admit they&#39;d been
fighting aliens for nearly a decade without a real
result, so they covered everything up.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re probably trying to break into the geofront
now,&quot; Mackie said urgently, &quot;we&#39;ve got to get people
organized to try and stop them.&quot;

&quot;The AD Police are committed to civilian evacuation,&quot;
Lisa said hesitantly.

Nene looked off into the distance, her expression
grim. &quot;Lisa, you&#39;re checked out on standard firearms,
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Lisa said tentatively.

&quot;I can&#39;t leave here,&quot; Nene met Mackie&#39;s eyes, &quot;though
god I wish I could. You&#39;ve got to get to the Locket,
they&#39;re using it as a headquarters for now.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Mackie nodded firmly, &quot;and be careful,
please.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Nene said softly. She looked at Lisa, &quot;I&#39;m
putting Mackie in your hands, I want you to get him to
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket in one piece. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Lisa saluted.

&quot;Nene...&quot; Mackie started to protest.

&quot;This is non-negotiable,&quot; Nene was firmly in command
voice as she continued, &quot;you take her, or you&#39;re not
going at all.&quot;

Mackie blinked, then smiled wryly. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; he
saluted, too.

Nene rolled her eyes.</pre>
