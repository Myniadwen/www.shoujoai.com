fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tanuki.html">Tanuki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/kakubara-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Anthy sat down at the drawing table Utena had in her room and riffled 
through some of the pictures that they had there. There were a few cute 
sketches of Chibi-Utena dashing with her sword, and Chu-chu eating 
things much too large for his body; including Sayonji. She giggled, 
remembering how Sayonji had stared at the creature after seeing it. 

She turned a few pages back and stopped. Those pages contained sketched 
of a new uniform for Utena. She traced over the lines with a finger, 
musing over the images she had thought of. It had bolder lines than 
Utena&#39;s old one. It was also more reminiscent of the uniforms that the 
student council wore. She thought back to the other day when those 
uniforms came in the mail. It was that moment that Anthy made a silent 
decision. She stood and moved to the closet. She pulled out a roll of 
pink fabric and sat on the bed. She had work to do.

Utena walked in a few minutes later. She stopped eating her bowl of 
instant ramen and stared at the pieces Anthy had already cut out.

&quot;Um, Hime, what&#39;re you doin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Utena-otto; I was just working on something for you. Your old 
uniform won&#39;t do for the new school year, so I&#39;m making you a new one.&quot;

&quot;Um, it&#39;s pink.&quot; Utena pointed out, pointing at the oddly colored 
fabric.

&quot;Actually it&#39;s rose. It&#39;s almost the same color as your hair.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Utena said, sitting on the bed. She picked up the sheet of paper 
with the designs on it. &quot;Hey, is this what it&#39;s supposed to look like?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Hey, according to this date, you drew this the night of the...&quot;

&quot;Yes; the night of the carnival. I was wondering if you remembered 
that.&quot;

&quot;How could I forget? That was a weird week anyway&quot;

&quot;Yes it was Utena-otto.&quot;

Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Kakumei no Bara

A Carnival; A Carnival

Utena walked into her apartment, a tired wreck. Anthy followed shortly 
behind. She had been following the girl for at least half of the town, 
without so much as a sentence said between them. When they finally 
stumbled into Utena&#39;s apartment, the girl went straight for the couch.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not much for company Himemiya, but I&#39;m so tired right 
now.&quot; Utena said into the cushions of her couch. Anthy sat in a close 
recliner and smiled, amused.

&quot;Poor Utena, you look like you&#39;ve been through a lot.&quot;

&quot;I have. Do you know that I&#39;ve been so tired since I was expelled that 
I spent the first week I was home in my bed&quot;

&quot;Expelled?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, expelled remember. I was caught fighting with someone and they 
expelled me. The guy even stabbed me,&quot; Utena said as she lifted up her 
shirt partially to show a scar in her lower chest. Anthy stared at it 
with horror. Tears started welling up in her eyes. Her hands curled 
around the imaginary sword she had held those long months ago.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah; must&#39;ve been one helluva fight. All I really remember is waking 
up one day and the chairman telling me that because of my actions that 
I had to be expelled. Imagine that, the chairman actually stopping by 
to tell me that.&quot; Utena yawned after she finished her story. For some 
reason she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open.

&quot;Maybe I should get us some tea, Utena.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, maybe you should. Third drawer on top. I&#39;m sorry if I can&#39;t be a 
very good host; I&#39;m just so incredibly tired.&quot; Utena was just fighting 
to keep her eyes open at this point. 

By the time Anthy was back with the tray Utena was already unconscious. 
She snored lightly. Anthy was taken aback by just how adorable Utena 
looked in her sleep. She moved to move some hair out of her face. She 
had been snorting when it got into her nose. As her hand brushed 
Utena&#39;s cheek, she saw something.

A flash...chains. What&#39;s going on here?

Anthy stepped back for a moment and looked again. Utena started tossing 
in her sleep. Her peaceful visage turned on her. Her brow furrowed and 
she started muttering.

&quot;Himemiya, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Anthy blanched at those words. What was going on in Utena&#39;s mind? She 
had to know. Tentatively, she reached out and cupped both sides of 
Utena&#39;s face with her hands. Utena stopped moving, but her breathing 
changed, becoming heavier.

&quot;In the name of the noble rose I contract my self to this power. I, the 
scion of the gods, open all the gateways that separate this world and 
the next. Now I open the door to the room of the soul, searching for 
the true spirit of this chosen one. I now bind myself to this soul with 
the power of a kiss. Let there be none that dare break this connection 
lest they suffer the fate of limitless torment.&quot;

Then Anthy leaned in and kissed her. There was a brief flash in her 
eyes; then she fell in.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There was blackness; blackness and chains. Utena was floating along, 
moving up and down to get out of the way of the running chains.

Utena was growing weary. She had been maneuvering around the chains for 
hours. Her broken sword clanged again as she blocked the movements of 
another chain. It had been bad enough that she was trapped in a chamber 
with all of these chains; but when they grew razor tips and started 
moving it got worse. 

Now she was bobbing and weaving around the chains to get out. She 
didn&#39;t know what was outside, but she knew that she had to get out. Her 
uniform was torn and battered. Her sword had shattered long ago and now 
only served to protect her from the more direct attacks of the chains.

&quot;I&#39;m so tired. I just want to rest. Why can&#39;t I just stop?&quot;

&quot;No! Don&#39;t stop!&quot;

Utena looked up. She thought she had heard someone. There wasn&#39;t 
supposed to be anyone else here. She had made sure that there was no 
one else around. This was her personal hell and she didn&#39;t want anyone 
else to have to experience it.

&quot;Please Utena, don&#39;t stop!&quot;

&quot;That voice.&quot;

Utena looked up to see a figure moving through the chains. This was not 
an easy task since the chains were now aiming for the intruder. They 
moved to block her path as she floated towards the prince. However, she 
persevered; getting ever closer to the beaten girl. Then, just as she 
was close enough to touch her, the chains moved into place. They formed 
a web in front of Utena, keeping Anthy from her. They stiffened, 
creating an impenetrable barrier.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t keep me from her. Please excuse me!&quot;

With a gesture Anthy sent the chains scattering. She smiled as she saw 
Utena&#39;s amazed expression. She moved in and held out her hand to the 
prince.

&quot;Himemiya, what&#39;re you doin&#39; here?&quot;

&quot;I came to get you out of this hell.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t; I deserve this. I couldn&#39;t save you. I failed you.&quot;

&quot;If you had failed me, would I be here to free you? I am no ghost sent 
to torment you. I am here to set your free.&quot;

&quot;I-I didn&#39;t fail?&quot;

&quot;No, you didn&#39;t. Now it&#39;s time for us to go home.&quot;

&quot;Home.&quot;

However, the chains wouldn&#39;t allow that. They circled around, gathering 
speed to try again. They all gathered together and struck forward. They 
were moving so fast that if they made contact, Utena and Anthy would be 
scattered everywhere. Anthy merely looked up and waved her hand. 
Suddenly, a barrier was up around them. While it was still black 
emptiness out there, inside it was raining rose petals. Utena stared 
around in childlike fascination. Anthy merely concentrated on the 
barrier and waited. The chains struck the barrier. For a second Anthy 
actually thought that they might get through. The chains made contact 
with the barrier and shattered. All of them scattered into the air, 
like metallic dust.

&quot;This is the true power I&#39;ve held. I can both entrap someone in their 
chains, and free them of the chains that bind them. I can do many more 
things, but this is my greatest gift of all.&quot;

&quot;Himemiya.&quot;

&quot;Please Utena, call me Anthy.&quot;

When the last of the attacking chains had been shattered, Anthy let 
down the shield. She relaxed against Utena. Then she saw it. A small 
red chain was zipping around, moving in a crazy pattern. It rushed up 
to them and started spinning around them. It made its way between their 
hands. It wrapped itself around, tying into a knot. It popped, becoming 
a small red thread. They both stared at it.

&quot;What is this?&quot;

&quot;This is a very good thing.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot;

At that Utena reached for her sword. The blade had been repaired.

&quot;Hey, my sword&#39;s fixed.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; Anthy said leaning in close. Utena was taken aback.

&quot;Hey what&#39;re you &#150;. &quot; She never finished her sentence as Anthy kissed 
her. There was another flash.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anthy stood up and moved back. It wouldn&#39;t do for Utena to find Anthy 
in her face when she woke up. She thought of the chains imprisoning 
Utena&#39;s soul.

At least it explains why she didn&#39;t remember anything.

Utena&#39;s eyes fluttered open, her head felt light and her lips tingled. 
She was a little confused. When she looked up, there was Anthy standing 
there. Her hair was down and there were no glasses. She knew somewhere 
in her heart of hearts that this is how she should look.... Then her 
memory came back.

&quot;Anthy, you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Tenjou Utena-san.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Keisuke sat back and relaxed. It had been forever since he actually had 
a chance to rest like this. If he wasn&#39;t in school, he was helping out 
in his parent&#39;s ice cream parlor. Thus, he planned to relish this time 
he had. He sat back in his chair and relaxed. He tilted till it was in 
its hind legs. He leaned it back... back... back...

BANG, BANG, BANG

And promptly fell over when Utena &quot;knocked&quot; on the door. Rubbing his 
head, he got up and went to answer it. As expected, there stood Utena; 
but next to her was a very attractive girl. Her dark skin seemed to 
glow and she smiled at him.

&quot;Oh, hey; what&#39;s up with you? Why&#39;re you bothering me on my day off?&quot;

&quot;Cuz it&#39;s your day off Kei you brat.&quot;

Who&#39;re you calling a brat, you midget?&quot;

CHOMP

&quot;Ow, quit bitin&#39; my head&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what you get, stupid Kei.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay; just introduce me to your friend already.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right. Sorry; Dana Keisuki, meet Himemiya Anthy. She&#39;s a... friend 
from school. She&#39;ll be staying with me for a while.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you Keisuki-san.&quot;

&quot;Ditto, but please, call me Kei. If you hadn&#39;t noticed, most of my 
friends and even the tomboy over here do.&quot; He said gesturing towards 
Utena.

&quot;Alright, Kei it is.&quot;

&quot;Hey whaddaya mean, &#145;and the tomboy&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s face it kid, we&#39;ve been more than friends for a long time now. 
Christ, you&#39;re like my little sister. Emphasis on the little.&quot;

Utena started trying to punch him. He merely held her at bay by holding 
her head at arms length. Anthy giggled watching them. She could see why 
Utena wanted her to meet this Kei. He was probably even closer to her 
than Wakaba.

&quot;Alright, alright; come on in. I guess we have a lot of catching up to 
do.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On the walk home, the three of them relished in the wonderful sensation 
of being full. While Anthy had only settled for a modest salad, Utena 
and Kei had pigged out. Anthy had never seen such a spectacle as the 
two of them fighting over the portions they had been allotted. If it 
had not been an all you can eat establishment, she was sure that it 
would have ended in violence.

&quot;Oh man, nobody kiss me. I taste like garlic.&quot; Utena murmured as she 
walked along, holding her stomach. Kei walked behind her, holding his 
bloated stomach in like fashion.

&quot;Yeah right like anyone here&#39;s bound to kiss you anyway.&quot;

Utena inclined her head towards Anthy, their eyes met and Anthy felt a 
blush stain her cheeks. All this went unnoticed by Kei.

When they finally got to the front of Utena&#39;s building, Kei and Utena&#39;s 
fighting had reached a lull. They parted and the two girls went 
upstairs. When they entered the apartment the phone was wringing and 
from the looks of things, it had been wringing for a while. The machine 
had over twelve messages on it.

&quot;Great, what could it be this time?&quot; Utena grumbled, picking up the 
receiver. &quot;Yeah, okay, sure. Okay, I&#39;ll be sure to keep that in mind.&quot; 
She hung up and sighed. &quot;Just fucking great.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Utena?&quot; Anthy asked from where she was sitting.

&quot;That was the landlord; he had to turn off the water boiler for the 
night. They have to do repairs. We&#39;ve only got an hour of hot water 
left.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we don&#39;t have enough to take two showers really.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure we could make it last better if we showered together.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Utena blurted from where she was. Her face wouldn&#39;t stop 
burning.

&quot;Yes. I mean you do have such a big shower and we could wash each 
other&#39;s backs. I mean it&#39;s not like this is the first time we&#39;ve seen 
each other under such circumstances. We we&#39;re roommates after all.&quot;

Utena relaxed and licked her lips. The girl&#39;s logic had made sense. 
&quot;Yeah, I guess so. Get your stuff then.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The shower was not as big as they had originally remembered it to be. 
While there was enough room for two people to shower together, there 
was not enough room to fit their combined shyness. They could feel each 
other&#39;s body heat; it made it even warmer than the hot water could have 
afforded them.

&quot;I thought you said we&#39;d done this sort of thing before.&quot;

&quot;I said it wouldn&#39;t be the first time we&#39;ve seen each other under such 
circumstances. We&#39;ve been in the bathroom at the same time while one of 
us was showering.&quot;

&quot;How nice.&quot;

&quot;Here, please do my back.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Wash my back, please. I figure it&#39;d be better since you have better 
access than I do.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Utena turned around only to see the slender girl moving her 
hair. Such beautiful hair. She slapped herself and took a step to close 
the distance. Anthy was waiting expectantly; her patience was rewarded 
as she felt Utena&#39;s hands on her back, scrubbing the soap into her 
skin.

She&#39;s so soft. Calm down Tenjou, you can get through this. My god, she 
looks so fragile. Kind of like a china doll.

However, Utena&#39;s mind was already starting to numb over. Her scrubs 
were starting to soften, turning into caresses. Son she was massaging 
Anthy&#39;s spine. She smiled as she heard the other girl start to purr. 
Then things started to get out of hand. Anthy started leaning back, 
forcing Utena to hold her up with her chest. She felt Anthy&#39;s head fall 
backwards and lay on her shoulder. Her hands starting inching under her 
arms, rubbing at her sides and making their way towards Anthy&#39;s chest.

&quot;Utena.&quot;

When Anthy moaned her name, the spell was broken. Utena came back to 
herself. She saw the position she was in and quickly tried to remedy 
it. She leveled Anthy off of her and moved toward the stream. She got 
all of the soap off of her and stepped out of the tub in record time. 
She was out of the bathroom before Anthy even had time to protest.

&quot;Utena-sama.&quot; Anthy croaked weakly from the tub as she curled into a 
ball. A half hour later Anthy yelped loudly when the warm water ran 
out.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A week passed and they didn&#39;t speak of the incident. The one day as 
they were out on the town they passed a street lamp. A poster lay on it 
and Anthy stopped to read it. Utena was a few feet ahead before she 
realized that Anthy was not next to her. She turned and spied her 
friend staring intently at the poster. She hadn&#39;t stopped sucking on 
her ice pop.

&quot;Hey Himemiya; what&#39;re you looking at?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Utena; there&#39;s going to be a fair here in a few days. Can we go?&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure.&quot;

&quot;Oh good.&quot; Anthy smiled at her and Utena felt a sinking in her heart. 
She had a strange feeling that something very strange was coming her 
way. She groaned and rubbed her head. It was too early for such deep 
thoughts.

&quot;Are you alright Utena?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go bother Kei before we go to the mall.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anthy stood in Utena&#39;s room, waiting for her to come back with whatever 
she said she was going to show her. She moved over to the drawing table 
Utena had in a corner. Blank paper adorned it and a pencil waited to be 
used. She sat down and began to draw. She was halfway through her third 
page of details when Utena came back in.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;re you doing?&quot;

&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; Anthy said standing up. She was still clasping the 
pencil. Utena walked up and looked over her shoulder.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re pretty good. What&#39;s this of?&quot;

&quot;Um, nothing. Just some random sketches.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay. Well, stand over here. I want to show you what I have for 
you.&quot; She stood Anthy in the middle of the room and pulled something 
out of a box. In the end she had placed a purple Kimono on front of 
Anthy gauging if it needed to be hemmed or not. Anthy stared down at it 
with wide eyes.

&quot;W-where did you get this?&quot;

&quot;It was my mother&#39;s. I remembered it and figured it&#39;d go well with your 
hair.&quot;

&quot;Really? You wanted me to wear your mother&#39;s yukata?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it mean too much to you to have me wear it?&quot;

&quot;Anthy, you mean a lot to me too. That&#39;s why I want you to wear it.&quot; 
Utena said, looking at Anthy with soft eyes. She shook it off before 
Anthy had a chance to look back. The girl was blushing deeply.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

After long tense moment of just staring into each other&#39;s eyes, they 
started leaning in closer. They could feel each other&#39;s breath on their 
faces. They were so tantalizingly close that Utena felt a violent wave 
of disappointment wash over her when Anthy pulled away and turn.

&quot;Well, it looks like this should fit me just fine. I should go and 
change.&quot; Anthy couldn&#39;t seem to keep the hoarseness out of her voice.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Utena responded, sounding just as hoarse. Anthy exited the 
room, moving as if she were in a daze. With similar movements, Utena 
sat on her bed. She tucked her knees up to her chin and started rocking 
back and forth.

&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The bus ride to the festival was uneventful, only long. The two rode in 
silence, relaxing into a comfortable lull. Finally though, they arrived 
at their destination.

&quot;C&#39;mon, hurry up Anthy. I wanna do everything.&quot;

&quot;We have plenty of time, maybe you should slow down.&quot; Anthy replied 
giggling. Utena laughed back and looked around. Her eyes snagged on 
something and she ran off, telling Anthy to stay still she returned. 
Anthy moved into a crook and waited. As she did, she took note of her 
surroundings. The soft music being pumped through small speakers, the 
lovers walking about, holding hands or wrapped around each other. Every 
once in a while she spied a bickering couple; the girl angry at her 
boyfriend for acting like a fool in front of his friends. She was so 
engrossed in the atmosphere that she didn&#39;t notice Utena coming up 
behind her.

&quot;White or brown chocolate?&quot;

Anthy jumped a few feet into the air in front of Utena. She landed, 
clutching her heart.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I bought candied apples; white and brown chocolate. Which do you 
want?&quot;

&quot;Any which one will do.&quot;

&quot;But I want you to make the decision. I mean, I don&#39;t know what you 
like.&quot;

&quot;Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never actually had one of those.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve never actually been to a carnival. I also didn&#39;t have many 
friends to do things with.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Utena paused for a minute. Then her energy returned and she 
turned to face the smaller girl. &quot;Alright, then you&#39;ll learn which one 
you like better now.&quot;

&quot;Ara, Utena, I don&#39;t think I can eat both of those things right now.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll close your eyes right now and I&#39;ll let you have a 
bite of each. Then you&#39;ll choose which one you like better.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes fluttered closed and she tilted her head up. Utena 
took the moment to look over her companion. Anthy looked radiant in 
Utena&#39;s mother&#39;s kimono. She had almost choked up; remembering the last 
time her mother had worn it. She leaned in close and surveyed her face. 
In truth, Utena felt pulled to this girl. She was so pulled that she 
was starting to lean in closer. She saw Anthy&#39;s brow furrow.

&quot;Utena, where are those samples you were supposed to give me.&quot; Then she 
felt Utena&#39;s breath on her face and her mouth stopped, forming an o of 
shock.

&quot;Hold on.&quot; Utena said as she threw caution to the wind and kissed 
Anthy. They stayed very still for long moments, until Anthy threw her 
arms around Utena&#39;s neck. The kiss turned deep and meaningful.

Utena, I love you so much.

&quot;Hey you two!&quot; Kei yelled from across the street. He couldn&#39;t see 
across the crowd very well, but he spied pink and purple hair. Not many 
people out there had those hair colors. He hoped that he hadn&#39;t been 
interrupting something just them.

The girls pulled away and looked at each other.

&quot;White or brown chocolate?&quot;

&quot;Just chocolate will do.&quot; Utena pulled out the two apples and Anthy 
took the white one. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot; Whether they were talking about the kiss or the apples 
neither was sure. They merely started moving towards the yelling blond 
across the street.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

&quot;Oh man, look at that thing. It&#39;s even bigger than the one last year.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to give it a whirl.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think it looks a little dangerous?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the appeal Anthy&quot;

The thing they were all referring to was a five story rollercoaster, 
waiting for the crowd to gather and be amazed by its raw power. Anthy 
was eyeing it warily while Utena and Kei stared at it like children.

&quot;Look at it, it&#39;s challenging us.&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;We have to get on it.&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;To accept its challenge.&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;To prove what brave men we are.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot;

&quot;Brave men and women.&quot;

&quot;Better.&quot;

&quot;Um, guy&#39;s I think I&#39;ll sit this out. I don&#39;t want to wrinkle the 
kimono any.&quot;

Utena stared at her warily. Their eyes locked for just a second. That 
was long enough for them to both start blushing. Finally Utena nodded 
acceptance and turned to Kei.

&quot;Come on, I don&#39;t think Anthy&#39;s up to getting on a rollercoaster.&quot;

&quot;How come?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s kinda delicate. I don&#39;t think her body&#39;d appreciate a 
rollercoaster like us rough and tumble types can.&quot;

&quot;I can accept that. C&#39;mon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wait on that bench over there, okay?&quot;

Utena walked over to Anthy and placed a hand on her cheek. She nuzzled 
the hand and stared adoringly into Utena&#39;s eyes, waiting for her to say 
something. Though Anthy was free, Utena&#39;s slightest wish was her 
command. She would gladly kill herself if it would make Utena happy in 
the long run.

&quot;Just be careful okay. I don&#39;t know what I would do if something 
happened to you while I was on that ride.&quot;

Anthy merely nodded happily. Utena made her way back to Kei and they 
started walking towards the ride. Though they didn&#39;t notice it, Kei had 
noted the exchange with a mind that was slowly turning those events 
over like a puzzle.

Anthy made her way to the bench and sat down. She saw the way they 
fought like children to get to the front. She giggled when Kei put 
Utena into a headlock and she wailed for him to let her go.

&quot;May I sit here?&quot;

Anthy looked and saw a girl of about 19 standing next to the bench. She 
moved her bag out of the way and motioned for the girl to sit. She 
slumped into the seat and pulled a fan out of her sleeve.

&quot;These days are getting warm.&quot;

&quot;Yes, they are. It&#39;s lucky for us that this festival is at night or 
we&#39;d be sweating even worse.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Name&#39;s Kamino Ayani; what&#39;s yours?&quot;

&quot;Himemiya Anthy; pleased to meet you.&quot; They shook hands, but when they 
did Anthy felt a chill run up her spine. There was something about this 
girl that she felt wary of.

&quot;So, how long have you known Utena?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;How long have you known Utena? I thought she&#39;d at least tell you a 
little about me. We were very close.&quot;

The way the girl pronounced close made another chill pass through 
Anthy&#39;s body. She didn&#39;t like the direction this girl was going. She 
started edging away. &quot;Um, about a school year. We were roommates.&quot;

&quot;Heh, we went to school together as well. Yep, she was younger then, 
but she still had that fire inside of her. That zeal to become a 
prince. It attracted many friends to her.&quot;

Anthy turned her head and stared at Utena&#39;s car. She saw how she 
screamed at a loop-the-loop. &quot;Yes, I know that fire.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t invest your emotions in her, girl. She won&#39;t return your 
feelings. Just find someone else. She&#39;s looking for her &#145;prince.&#39; She 
won&#39;t stop chasing a hallucination from her childhood and she&#39;ll hurt 
all the people around her because of that fact.&quot;

Anthy thought to the year prior. She saw how Utena found her prince and 
was betrayed by him. She was there when Utena fought her prince was 
nearly died. This girl didn&#39;t know Utena at all

&quot;I have to go, the ride is almost over. Utena will be waiting for me.&quot;

Anthy got up to leave, but she was grabbed and pinned to the bench. She 
saw the Ayani girl holding her down with a mad hatred in her eyes.

&quot;No she won&#39;t. She&#39;s mine, so stay away from her bitch! Where does a 
skinny little cunt like you get off thinking she could ever love you? 
What do you possibly have to offer her? You can&#39;t even keep up with her 
I bet. I don&#39;t even think you&#39;re very good in bed. Then again, one 
never knows unless they try right.&quot; She said with a mad gleam in her 
eye. She grabbed Anthy&#39;s wrists and forced them over her head. Her 
other hand started roaming Anthy&#39;s body over the kimono. Tears started 
welling up for what this girl was about to do to her.

Please, Utena help me.

&quot;Utena!&quot;

Utena was just getting off the ride with Kei. He looked a little green, 
but she was just fine. She was looking around for Anthy when she heard 
her scream. Her head snapped in the direction the sound was coming 
from. She saw someone trying to hurt Anthy.

Utena saw red.

Utena took a step

Utena was gone.

Anthy was crying full on now as Ayani moved hand to get under the 
kimono. How was no one noticing what was was going on? It seemed like 
the people around her were just ignoring the proceedings. Then; all at 
once, the wait on her body was lifted. She looked up to see Ayani gone. 
She tightened her collar and went to go look for Utena. She didn&#39;t see 
her, but she did see a path carved into the ground. It went from the 
rollercoaster and went by the bench. It traveled off after that. She 
started running off in the direction it went to.

Ayani felt herself ripped from the dark girl one second, and then 
slammed against a wall the next. There had been no walls to slam her 
against back at the rollercoaster. She felt herself pit the wall behind 
her. She opened her eyes and looked down. There was Utena staring at 
her like she was going to kill her.

&quot;Hello Utena.&quot; Ayani purred

&quot;Ayani.&quot; Utena growled.

&quot;Quite a coincidence to be catching you here don&#39;t you think.&quot;

&quot;What were you doing to Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, her. I was merely trying to get rid of her. She really isn&#39;t 
worthy of you dear.&quot; Ayani said, cupping Utena&#39;s face. Utena merely 
snarled and slammed her against the wall again.

&quot;You stay away from her you crazy bitch. Stay away from me too. She is 
the only one &#145;worthy&#39; as you keep saying. Just stay away.&quot;

&quot;Why; what does she have that I don&#39;t? I can keep up with you and do 
all of the things you like to do. She can&#39;t even resist me.&quot;

Utena slapped her.

&quot;Shut up! I told you before to stay out of my life.&quot; Suddenly she 
looked very tired. &quot;Please just go home and leave me alone. Can&#39;t you 
see that I don&#39;t want you?&quot;

&quot;Not while she&#39;s your bitch, I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll ki-&quot;

Utena slammed her again, harder this time. The dent in the wall behind 
her got larger and bits of rubble blew away.

&quot;Stay away from her! If you even consider going after her, I&#39;ll kill 
you where you stand! Go home Ayani; there&#39;s nothing more we have to say 
to each other&quot;

Utena turned and started to walk away. She looked very tired.

&quot;She must really have you under some spell. Tell me Utena, what&#39;s it 
like to be fucked by a nigger?&quot;

Before she could even think again, Utena was in her face. She roared 
and reared her hand back. Her fist started traveling forward at such an 
incredible speed that if it made contact Ayani would die right on the 
spot. Ayani closed her eyes and awaited the inevitable, until...

&quot;No, Utena don&#39;t!&quot;

Utena&#39;s hand impacted the wall behind Ayani and the whole wall exploded 
behind her. Ayani opened her eyes to see what had stopped Utena&#39;s 
attack. First she saw Utena&#39;s eyes glowing an eerie shade if red, then 
she saw Anthy with her hand on Utena&#39;s shoulder. Utena merely stood 
there; tears leaking out. Anthy turned Utena to face her and wiped the 
other girl&#39;s tears. She started to walk Utena away. Ayani roared in 
righteous indignation. This was something between her Utena and 
herself. Who was that interloper to get between Utena and herself?

&quot;Don&#39;t get in the middle of this. This isn&#39;t over Utena.&quot; Anthy merely 
turned and stared at the girl. Her eyes was glowing an unholy purple. 
Then she heard a voice inside her head.

((( If you value your life at all, I&#39;d suggest staying away from her 
)))

Ayani stopped.

They kept going.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

They walked the long way back to Kei and the rollercoaster. It turned 
out that in that second Utena had managed to run a quarter mile. 
Neither was sure how it had happened, but they were both too 
emotionally numb at that time to analyze it. After they met up with Kei 
again, they decided it was time for them to eat.

The restaurant was in full swing when they got in. The dance floor was 
full of people searching for a good time. After the preliminaries of 
ordering and small talk Utena got up from the table.

&quot;Erm, gotta go.&quot; She started heading towards the bathrooms.

Anthy merely sighed and leaned her head against a hand. &quot;I told her not 
to have that big gulp before.&quot;

Kei laughed at that. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be Utena if she didn&#39;t do stupid 
things like that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Anthy said, reflecting on the events of an hour prior. &quot;She 
also wouldn&#39;t be Utena if she didn&#39;t do such brave things to protect 
people.&quot;

Kei watched her for a while. His face hardened with every passing 
second. He didn&#39;t want to do this, but it had to be done.

&quot;Utena never told you about Ayani, did she?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;I can understand why. This isn&#39;t a story most people want to hear.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;It was when we were in out last school, before her and Wakaba were 
chosen to go to Ohtori. Ayani&#39;s father traveled a lot and his latest 
stop was here. Anyway, she lived pretty close to Utena those days. So 
naturally they got to know each other. Utena was ecstatic. For once she 
knew a girl who was as tough as she was. They went everywhere together. 
Of course, that&#39;s how the bad shit happened.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you feel it Anthy? Utena has such an incredible strength of 
character; anyone who spends time with her is bound to fall in love 
with her. Hell, even I was infatuated with her at once point. Utena 
didn&#39;t want it though. She always offered friendship though.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t like hurting people, and she avoids it at all costs. 
Anyway; I accepted her friendship and we became the great team we are 
now. I don&#39;t think she could have wanted a better big brother.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right; you torture her enough for three big brothers.&quot;

Kei&#39;s laughter rang throughout the restaurant. It lasted for a good 
minute; unfortunately it died down and Kei&#39;s face became very serious. 
Anthy knew that the story had come to the part he wanted her to hear.

&quot;Like I said, I accepted her friendship, but Ayani didn&#39;t. She was 
obsessed. She was convinced that Utena was only testing her; that all 
she had to do was convince her that she was the one. &quot;You&#39;ve already 
seen Ayani&#39;s idea of convincing people. &quot; Anthy nodded meekly and 
tightened her collar again. &quot;She attacked Utena behind school one day. 
Luckily Utena was strong enough to resist and she ran home. A few 
people saw her torn uniform and questions started surfacing. Ayani 
tried to spread a rumor that Utena and she were having a secret love 
affair and that Utena had gotten a bit rough. Everyone knew it was 
total bullshit though. Utena&#39;s not the type to have a secret affair.&quot; 
Anthy looked away, sadly. She remembered the events with her brother.

No, that wasn&#39;t Utena. That was the person her brother was trying to 
turn her into. The real Utena isn&#39;t like that.

&quot;Anyway, the truth got out and Ayani was arrested. She got out on a 
psych evaluation and had to go to a shrink. I think they should getter
their money back. Damn quack! Anyway, Utena hasn&#39;t talked to anyone
about it since the trial. She doesn&#39;t like to admit that someone could
hurt her like that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah; I guess Utena isn&#39;t very likely to fall in love after that, huh?
I mean, after all it was someone claiming to love her that did that to
her.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bullshit me Anthy. I thought we were close enough by now that
you could trust me with the truth. I see the way you look at each other.
You&#39;ve got it bad for her.&quot; Anthy blushed and nodded. &quot;I&#39;m also sure
that Utena feels it too. Sure Utena protects everyone, but she&#39;s never
been that violent when someone she cares about is attacked. I also saw
you two back at the rollercoaster before all this happened. She doesn&#39;t
look at anyone like that. Doesn&#39;t touch anyone like that either.&quot;

Anthy stopped and put her hand to her cheek, remembering how Utena&#39;s
hand felt. She also remembered the kiss from earlier. Her blush and
dreamy smile made Kei smile.

&quot;Thought so; of all the people to come into Utena&#39;s life, I think you&#39;re
her favorite.&quot; They watched Utena coming back from the bathroom. They
waved at her to give her an idea of where to go. &quot;Utena just has some
problems dealing with her emotions. She&#39;s a very vulnerable person.
You&#39;ll have to tell her first.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Kei, for everything.&quot;

&quot;Nothing to it. I have to admit it, but of all the people to fall for
Utena, you&#39;re my favorite too.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Later, after the food had been eaten and the conversation had taken on
less intense topics; the three of them sat there. The band started
playing again. This one was a slow song. Some of the dancers left the
dance floor, taking the opportunity to take a rest. Utena spied the
scene and turned back to Anthy.

&quot;Oii Himemiya, wanna dance?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes.&quot; Anthy blushed again. So did Utena. Anthy took Utena&#39;s free
hand and let herself be guided to the dance floor. The music was too
slow for the complex waltzes they did back at Ohtori. Instead Utena
wrapped her hands around Anthy&#39;s waist and pulled her close. Anthy
wrapped her arms around Utena&#39;s neck. Their movements were slow, almost
minimal. It was a sweet torture for them. Anthy let herself be lulled
by Utena&#39;s steel blue eyes.

&quot;This is nice, huh Hime- Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Hime, I like that.&quot;

&quot;You are a princess. So of course it&#39;d fit.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not princess. You know what I&#39;ve done.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care about all that. You&#39;re a princess to me.&quot;

Anthy stared at her, wide eyed. Then she contented herself to lean her
head against Utena&#39;s shoulder. She could smell her, and she relished in
that. Utena could smell the rose scent of Anthy hair and sighed. They
kept dancing for a long while. However, the song finally ended and the
other patrons started exiting the dance floor. Utena took notice after
someone bumped into them by accident. She stopped and Anthy stared up
at her.

&quot;We should go back to our seats.&quot; Utena rasped. Her voice couldn&#39;t seem
to work right.

&quot;Yes, maybe we should. &quot; Anthy replied with a shaky voice. Utena turned
to walk back to their seats, when she felt a tug on her arm. She looked
back, and saw that her hand was still clasping Anthy&#39;s. She looked up
and Anthy smiled. She squeezed Utena&#39;s hand and started walking. They
didn&#39;t let go until they got back to the table

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The group was walking dinner off when they came upon a rather large
crowd, and it was still growing. Utena, Anthy and Kei managed to push
their way to front, to find a man standing in the center of the circle,
standing over a defeated opponent with a bokken in his hand.

&quot;Is there any fighter here who can best the great Yuuki Eiri na no ka?
C&#39;mon, there&#39;s gotta be one person here who can do it. The prize is
seven hundred thousand yen. C&#39;mon, do we have any takers?&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes lit up, a duel was definitely up her alley. The only thing
that would have been more of a sure thing would have been a basketball
challenge. She turned to Anthy.

&quot;C&#39;mon Hime, let&#39;s do it!&quot;

&quot;Are you sure Utena? I mean; don&#39;t you hate to duel?&quot;

&quot;Eh, dueling over you was one thing, but this guy&#39;s just using a bokken
and it&#39;s not like I can lose anything important. Besides, it&#39;ll be just
like old times.&quot;

Anthy thought about it for a moment, and then walked over to the young
man who was calling the fight. After talking to him for a moment, he
handed her a bokken and went to talk to the duelist he had called Eiri.
A bit of a conversation later, the boy nodded in Anthy&#39;s direction. She
then proceeded to pull two roses out of her Kimono. She walked over to
Eiri and pinned one to his shirt lapel. She then walked over to Utena
and did the same. Utena stared down at her wide eyed till Anthy looked
back up at her with a wiked gleam in her eye.

&quot;Here&#39;s to old times.&quot;

Utena smirked and took her position. Eiri took his and the boy walked
to the center.

&quot;The rules of this duel are simple. This is a duel with an unrestricted
time limit. Whoever gets their rose knocked off their chest loses the
duel. Do you understand?&quot; Utena and Eiri merely nodded. &quot;THEN...HAJIME
NO DA!!!&quot; With a flourish he dropped his hand and the duel began.

Utena watched her opponent circle around, looking for a gap in her
defenses. She turned to keep and eye on him. A bead of sweat gathered
on her brow and traveled down her face. She heard her pulse quicken
until that was all she could hear. Instead of the stance she normally
took when she held the Dios no Ken, she took on a more traditional
drawn sword stance. 

That bead of sweat that had been traveling down her face took a most
unfortunate path and traveled into her eye. When she blinked to clear
it, he made his move. Coming at her with a typical stabbing motion,
intended to make her dodge and thus open herself up to a de-roseing.
Utena did dodge, but further back than he would have imagined. Her eyes
opened and he saw an intensity burning in them. Then she was gone,
simply vanished. When he swerved his head to find where she went, he
found her at the opposite end of the crowd. People were staring at her
in awe. She should not have been able to move that fast. She turned to
look at him slowly, a smirk on her face.

Nthy had been watching what had been going on and the look on her face
said that she knew what was going on with Utena&#39;s new speed. Kei
whispered in her ear. &quot;What&#39;s going on, how did she get so fast?&quot; To
which she replied. &quot;Apparently, she finally became the prince she had
been hoping for.&quot;

Eiri had had enough. He lifted his sword into the ready position; Utena
did the same. He charged her. He got no more than five steps before she
vanished again. He felt the wind pass his body and when he looked down;
his rose was fluttering to his feet. He turned to look behind him and
there was Utena, standing with the wind blowing her hair in relaxed
stance. She turned to face him as well and with a cheerful smile on her
face said, &quot;I win.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The cab pulled in front of Utena&#39;s building sometime around one in the
morning. The girls climbed out. Anthy stood and leaned against Utena.
She was fighting to stay awake. Utena stroked her back. A slight wind
passed and the small girl shivered. She burrowed into Utena for warmth.

&quot;Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about what Ayani did. It was inexcusable&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright; she couldn&#39;t really hurt me anyway. But, there was one
thing she said that cut deep.&quot;

&quot;What was it?&quot;

&quot;She said that you&#39;d never return my feelings.&quot;

&quot;What feelings?&quot;

Anthy looked up shyly. She wasn&#39;t sure if she should actually say it.
Then she remembered Kei&#39;s words. Temporarily emboldened to speak. &quot;Um,
I love you?&quot;

Utena&#39;s heart stopped. She loved her. The little chibi Utena in her
heart was doing back flips and hooting. She wanted to yell her joy from
the highest mountain. To stop strangers on the street and tell them
than Anthy loved her. Instead she smiled shyly and leaned in. Anthy
stared at her with wide innocent eyes. She was afraid. What would she 
o when Utena rejected her? Her breathing became labored and butterflies
fluttered about in her stomach. She licked her suddenly dry lips.

&quot;I-I love you too.&quot;

Tears sprang from Anthy&#39;s eyes. Her smile was beautiful. She felt Utena
kiss away her tears and laughed.

&quot;Working form memory, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;You know, you say that far too much.&quot; Anthy declared as she leaned up.
Utena met her halfway in a spectacular kiss.

Somewhere out there, a small red thread began glowing brilliantly. If
anyone looked they would have said that it was shining.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Utena stood there in her new uniform. She stared at herself. She was
impressed as to what Anthy was able to accomplish.

&quot;I love it.&quot;

&quot;I knew you would.&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure pink is the right color for it?&quot;

&quot;I thought you loved it?&quot;

&quot;Just asking!&quot;

Anthy made her way off of the bed, where she had been sitting and
sidled up alongside her husband.

&quot;Now we&#39;re ready to face him.&quot;

Utena&#39;s aunt came to the door then. She held up some papers for the
girls.

&quot;These are your travel papers; the tickets and everything are included.
You leave for the island in a few days.&quot;

&quot;Great; look out Ohtori, here I come!&quot;

&quot;And she&#39;s wearing pink this time.&quot;

&quot;ANTHY!!!&quot;

&quot;Calm down, Utena, it&#39;s a nice uniform.&quot;

&quot;Not you too Auntie?&quot;
