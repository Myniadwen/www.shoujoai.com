<h1>The Most Unexpected Thing (Prologue)</h1>

<pre>        The chapel was just on the edge of the city, not far from 
where Ohtori Academy itself stood. Designed in a more ancient style 
than the modern buildings of the city around it, the church rose up 
majestically, the stained glass windows designed with ancient images 
of saints and angels. Cars were lined up outside, and the exterior 
was draped with festive garlands, a colorful celebration of what was 
soon going to be happening just inside.

        Through the main doors, along the side of the packed main 
hall, there was the rectory, this time pressed into service as a 
waiting room where Arisugawa Juri paced back and forth restlessly, 
much to Utena&#39;s amusement.

        &quot;What&#39;s taking so long?&quot; Juri groused, running a hand 
through her long orange hair.

        Utena smiled up at her reassuringly as the pink haired woman 
in black said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry so much, Juri, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll finish 
setting up soon.&quot;

        Juri glared at the calmly smiling Utena, then she suddenly 
froze as a thought occured to her. &quot;You remembered the rings, didn&#39;t 
you?!&quot; Juri demanded, a bit white around the eyes. Utena reached 
into her pocket and pulled out two ring boxes. Casually popping them 
open she revealed two white-gold rings glittered on black 
velvet. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri sighed.

        &quot;Just like the three other times that you asked.&quot; Utena 
replied teasingly.

        Juri blushed just a bit, and resumed pacing the rectory in 
her tuxedo and tails. She felt a bit relieved that she had decided 
to skip the top hat, at least. As Juri walked she was unaware of how 
striking of a figure she made, the rainbow light shining in from the 
stained glass windows washing across her black garbed form.

        Utena certainly noticed it though, feeling just a bit of 
regret about how things had gone between them, years ago. &quot;You 
know,&quot; Utena quietly commented, &quot;I have to admit that I was kind of 
worried when you two first got involved.&quot; She smiled at Juri&#39;s 
expression, &quot;But you&#39;ve both matured a lot. I think you will be very 
happy together.&quot;

        Just then, Miki stuck his head into the room, the blue 
haired young man looking impish even dressed in his suit. &quot;The 
sacrificial altar is ready, you can bring the victim in!&quot; he said 
with a grin. &quot;Remember, don&#39;t let her run away, it ruins the timing!&quot;

        Juri shot him a fierce glare of his very own, then they all 
headed in. Juri took her place up in front of the altar, Utena 
standing behind her as her best man and Miki officiating in his role 
as a judge. A few moments later, and the wedding march began.

        Juri watched the small, veiled figure slowly makee her way 
up the aisle, moving smoothly and with grace towards them. Finally 
she reached Juri&#39;s side, and it took a;ll the former duelist&#39;s will 
not to kake her small hand in hers. The ceremony was a complete blur 
to her, but a few things stuck in Juri&#39;s mind; both Touga and 
Nanami&#39;s tears, Saionji&#39;s bitter presence, the tears of family and 
their many friends. And the comforting presence of the veiled figure 
standing beside her.

        At long last Juri heard the words she had so long waited to 
hear as Miki quietly said, &quot;You may kiss the brides!&quot;

        With slightly trembling hands, Juri took the edge of the 
veil in her hands and flipped it up smoothly. Leaning forward, she 
took Shinobara Wakaba&#39;s beaming face into her hands and kissed her 
long and hard. Hand in hand the two rushed down the aisle, even as 
the ladies gathered in the aisle just behind them. Taking her 
bouquet of red roses Wakaba closed her eyes, turned her back and 
then tossed it over her shoulder.

        &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Utena gasped in surprise as the bouquet 
dropped right into her hands

        Anthy smiled up at her, leaning in close to Utena. &quot;Maybe we 
should arange for another wedding, Utena-sama?&quot; she whispered in 
Utena&#39;s ear.

        Juri laughed as she heard that, then they reached the curb 
where Juri&#39;s classic roadster was waiting for them. As she handed 
Wakaba in, Juri smiled a soft,very private smile. Sometimes, she 
still couldn&#39;t believe how they had got together...
