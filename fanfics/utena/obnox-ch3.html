<a href="../utena/obnox-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kozue snuggled down into the warmth of the bed, and the feeling of the 
warm body lying next to her. &#39;I don&#39;t usually bring the boys home,&#39; 
she thought to herself drowsily, reaching over to who ever was laying 
beside her. She stroked the skin, and frowned sleepily at how smooth 
it was. She reluctantly opened her eyes a little, then they popped 
open on their own.

&quot;Good morning, Darling,&quot; Lum said to her sweetly. The naked girl 
laying there beside Kozue asked her cheerfully, &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot; 
Kozue looked dumbly at the pretty dark hared girl, until the situation 
began to sink in.

&quot;Aaah!&quot; Kozue cried out, sliding as far away from Lum as she could 
get, and promptly falling off the bed and onto the floor with a loud 
thump. &quot;Ow! Lum, what are you doing in my bed?&quot; Kozue demanded.

&quot;But Darling, engaged couples should always sleep together,&quot; Lum 
explained to her patiently. She climbed out of bed and picked her 
bikini up off the floor, which she promptly slid on. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going 
to get dressed?&quot; she asked.

Kozue picked her own clothes out and dressed as quickly as she could 
manage. She could feel Lum&#39;s gaze on her, and a small blush colored 
her cheeks. &quot;What are you going to do when I&#39;m in classes?&quot; Kozue 
asked Lum curiously.

&quot;I had to ask,&quot; Kozue sighed, Lum&#39;s arms wrapped firmly around her 
neck as the Oni floated like a banner extending behind her! &quot;Would you 
stop that?&quot; Kozue pleaded, seeing the crowd they were drawing.

&quot;But Darling, I want to be with you all the time!&quot; Lum answered her 
happily.

&quot;But I don&#39;t want you with me all the time!&quot; Kozue protested.

&quot;You don&#39;t want me with you, Darling?&quot; Lum asked her tearfully. Kozue 
tried to reassure her, then she saw Lum&#39;s eyes begin to glitter 
dangerously. Little sparks of lightning began to arc around Lum&#39;s 
hands as she raised them above her head.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Kozue said weakly. Zzzaaappp!

She was still smoking faintly as she sat down for her first class. Lum 
then perched backwards on the desk behind Kozue&#39;s. She kept her back 
turned to Kozue and made little &#39;hmmp&#39; noises occasionally.

Utena watched the two with an odd expression on her face. After class, 
she walked by Kozue and pulled her aside to ask her gently, &quot;Do you 
want to talk about it?&quot;

Kozue looked over at her in surprise, then nodded reluctantly. &quot;Yeah, 
maybe I do,&quot; she said, smiling a bit gratefully at Utena.

&quot;Hey, boy-girl!&quot; Lum said, glaring at Utena. &quot;Kozue is Lum&#39;s Darling, 
not yours!&quot;

Utena sweatdropped a bit at that. Kozue spoke up, &quot;It&#39;s OK, Lum. 
Utena&#39;s already engaged to Anthy.&quot; As if on cue, Anthy walked up to 
take Utena&#39;s arm and smile kawaiily to Lum and Kozue. </pre>
