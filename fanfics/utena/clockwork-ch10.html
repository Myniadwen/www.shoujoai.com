Anthy closed her eyes as the smoldering roof caved in on them, knowing there was nothing she 
could do to save herself. Touga and Ruka at the last minute shoved her down hard beneath 
them, and formed a dome with their backs and arms planted firmly above her. The world went 
dark as stone and wood rained down on them from above. Touga cried out in pain and collapsed 
onto her under the killing weight of the rubble...but as she waited , breathing heavily, 
there was no other sound. Her face was smushed into the seared floor and her body pressed 
tightly between Ruka and Touga who were pinned around her. Yet as she waited for the weight 
of the tower to crush them...there was nothing further.

Had they been sheltered by Touga&#39;s body after all? Worried, she tried not to move lest she 
upset whatever precarious settlement there may have been of the stone. The cramped darkness 
was sweltering hot and grew more stale as moments passed. They would run out of air 
surely...they could be dead before help ever reached them...perhaps Touga and Ruka were 
already dead and she was even now sandwiched between two decomposing bodies. As her mind 
began to whir with steadily more panicked thoughts, a tremble in the floor snapped her focus 
to her present predicament. The stone slabs above them shifted slightly, raining fine grit 
down onto her face and into her eyes. Blinking, Anthy breathed more rapidly, 
hyperventilating in fear as another trembled shook the floor and a loud wooden groan 
sounded.

Praying to Dios a thousand fearful prayers, her body trembling, Anthy squinted in her 
confinement to see past Touga&#39;s limp arm. The stones were moving! 
&quot;N...No...p-please...s-save...&quot; But a tremendous grinding came from above, and 
miraculously...the stones began to move upward! Anthy watched spell-bound as the slabs 
shifted and ground against each other, dust raining down on the three trapped people. As 
they lifted off of them completely, many of the smaller fragments tumbling off of the pile 
and clattering away, Anthy carefully rolled Touga off of her and tried to get to her hands 
and knees. Peering about unsteadily for what had saved them, expecting the court mages to be 
there with their staffs and power...she instead beheld the Guardian.

Alone, arms and legs trembling with the strain and collapsed onto one knee, the armored 
being was supporting the entire tower roof upon her back and shoulders. Her gloved fingers 
were splayed and her arms outstretched like timbers to bear up as much of the massive load 
as she could. Her face was a mask of tension and strain, her eyes blazing blue with small 
flecks like embers flickering from them. Anthy struggled to drag herself and the two men out 
of the way as Utena ground her teeth and began to shake even more.

Utena had...no...the Holy Warrior of Dios had come and saved them at that last moment, 
keeping the tower from collapsing and killing them entirely. Even now as she looked around 
them, many sections of the floor and walls were completely gone. Utena must have arrived 
right as it fell atop them, just in time to keep the tower from being obliterated 
completely. Like the god Atlas from the old tales in the south, Utena supported nearly the 
entire roof upon her back was slowly trembling to try and stand.

&quot;G-G...G-Guardian!!&quot; Princess Anthy called out desperately, fearful that Utena was ready to 
collapse. As she looked closer she could see Utena was far more battered than she 
remembered, and there were sparks and hissing emitting from her shoulders and knees. Her 
metal gauntlets were shattered in places and twisted outward. There were holes in her armor 
and one shoulder completely exposed. The shoulder guard completely gone. Trying to summon 
her power to do something, anything to help, Utena ignored Anthy and struggled up impossibly 
to both feet.

Running feet and shouting voices on the stairs signaled the rescued guards from earlier had 
arrived with help. Men in armor cautiously peeked around the corner, trying to figure a way 
inside. But Utena ignored them all still. Miki, his clothes clean and unhindered, shoved 
past them looking angry. &quot;Get out of my way!&quot;

But as he approached and began to wave his hands in the air, Utena&#39;s mouth opened in a loud 
gasp and she tilted her head back in a roar. Like a beast she hunched down under her 
load...and then stood to her full height in a demonstration of terrible strength. The roof 
groaned and rose upward, as with a staggering step she shifted her weight. The Guardian&#39;s 
blue flame eyes made her appear blind...and perhaps she was. For she spoke no words and 
seemed to see no one but her goal. Another bellowing roar and she gave an immense heave 
toward the open air of the missing tower walls. The roof tumbled off into space, the stray 
fragments caught by a wind coming from Miki&#39;s hands and guided away from the occupants in 
the room. The soldiers in the doorway paled in fear. No human was capable of such a feat. 
She truly was one of the gods!

Anthy flinched and hid amongst Touga&#39;s body as Utena collapsed to her knees, spent. Her pink 
snarled ponytail flopped along the back of her armor with the movement, as Miki cautiously 
moved to approach them. His mage eyes spun with blue and gold light as he took in their 
condition. Anthy crawled on her hands and knees over to her protector, leaving Miki to see 
to Touga and Ruka&#39;s condition. She couldn&#39;t seem to stop trembling as she reached out a hand 
to Utena. But the otherworldly woman gave no reaction at her approach, gazing out with 
unseeing eyes.

&quot;...mmm..my...My...Guardian?&quot; Anthy licked her dry lips nervously. The ordeal still had her 
heart beating wildly. Utena said nothing, but turned to face her with an alien expression. 
Her face had relaxed from the rage and anger and tension from earlier. But this new 
expression seemed more...frightening. Eyes still glowing hotly, she looked at Anthy with a 
face completely devoid of life and human understanding. After a time the being, for it 
surely wasn&#39;t Utena as Anthy had come to know her, cocked its head to the side and regarded 
her. It began speaking in a strange monotone.

&quot;Charge retrieval completed, re-engaging biometric locks. Mission status...pending. Scanning 
for hostile targets....hostile targets located within twenty kilometers...none. Enemy 
removal complete.&quot;

Anthy touched Utena&#39;s cheek but the pale woman didn&#39;t register the sensation. The cheek was 
cold as stone and just as rigid. Hard and unfeeling. Utena simply continued speaking into 
the open air, as Miki watched silently from across the room.

&quot;Scanning designated Charge # 639, Princess Anthy Isala Himemiya, for grievous injuries. 
Level 3 injuries not detected. Scanning for lower level physical state changes. Injuries 
detected...&quot;

&quot;Ute-Guardian, what are--&quot;

&quot;Fracture to left index finger, minor sprain to left ankle, contusion to the upper arm, 
right cheek, left--&quot;

&quot;--calf, and along the shoulder blades...bruising is minor, and can be treated.&quot; Miki 
cleanly cut in, his voice crisp and clinical. Utena&#39;s dully glowing eyes seemed to dim 
slightly as her neck rotated so she could face him. The court wizard had walked over to them 
after checking on the two unconscious men. His eyes still whirled with colored light. 
&quot;Yes...you seem to also posses the ability to see wounds upon others. But as you seem 
somewhat tired, please humbly allow me to assist with the healing. It&#39;s the least I can 
do...&quot; His boyish voice became thick with an unknown bitterness. Utena seemed to tense as he 
approached Anthy, invisible hackles rising.

&quot;I&#39;m just going to use my magik to heal her wounds. The other two are sleeping and are being 
looked after.&quot; Miki spoke calmly and softly, hands out in front as if to ward away an 
attack. Or to soothe a wild animal. Utena didn&#39;t relax, but she didn&#39;t move further as Miki 
close his eyes and placed pale palms just above Anthy&#39;s shoulders. A sort of transparent 
tremble in the air, like heat on a hot road...and the bruises blooming on her back began to 
fade. Utena&#39;s eyes seemed to finally stop glowing, as she slowly came back to herself.

&quot;H..h...huh...more...more hocus p-pocus...&quot; Her voice was strange though.

Anthy said nothing, feeling an aching tiredness start to wash over her as the adrenaline 
seeped away. Far down below in the courtyard, men were still shouting orders to put out 
fires and move soldiers to bolster the guard. Several more soldiers from the doorway had 
brought in stretchers to take Touga, Ruka, and their companions away to the infirmary. As 
Miki worked, Anthy noticed through her dull haze that he glanced over at Utena and suddenly 
stiffened. Anthy jerked her head back to look, catching a movement in the corner of her eye.

&quot;Utena!&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes rolled up into the back of her head as she pitched forward onto the floor with 
a heavy clanging thud. The room broke into frenzied chaos as the panicked soldiers rushed to 
surround them...

......

&quot;Listen...another war is coming. But I&#39;m worried that this time we won&#39;t come out as the 
victors.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? Surely with you as our War-Prince, we couldn&#39;t possibly lose. Everyone 
believes in you... I believe in you too.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;What? What&#39;s wrong? You know I love you.&quot;

&quot;...I know. That&#39;s what worries me...&quot;

Her breath hitched as she came back to herself. Her chest rose and fell in a quick deep 
jerk. The sensors in her head booted up to life, and began tracking her heart rate and blood 
pressure. Then her eyes slowly opened, letting in blurs of light and shadow. The paper thin 
lenses in her eyes clicked and shifted about, running through their various configurations 
until at last her normal vision focused onto the warm brown shoulder just in the bottom of 
her view. Blinking a few times, and overcome with a feeling of disorientation, Utena slowly 
tried to lift up her head and get a look around.

She was lying on top of what appeared to be some kind of stone altar, there were carving and 
candles on a mantle right beside her to her right. The altar had been covered with drapes of 
rich silk and furs, with roses and various flowers strewn about and falling all over the 
floor. She seemed to be in...some kind of tomb maybe. Or a special room. A church? She 
wasn&#39;t sure, but there were a set of low benches in the far back where the guards were just 
now rising from. Their faces were masked with red scarves and their white armor held no 
insignia. One silently motioned to the other and he/she departed out of the room, with 
another guard coming in to replace them.

Looking down at herself she found she was nude, which was disturbing in of itself, but that 
she was also covered in bandages. A thick red cloth had been draped over her to protect her 
decency. And down near her legs, Anthy was currently hunched unmoving. Having fallen asleep 
while kneeling beside her body perhaps. Had she been...praying? Utena pinched the bridge of 
her nose as the thick incense burning about the room started to give her a mild headache. 
What on earth happened to her?

Anthy stirred, probably feeling Utena sit up, and rubbed at her face. She looked haggard, 
Utena noted. But seeing Utena looking back at her, she gave a gasp and launched forward to 
embrace her tightly. Startled, Utena awkwardly gave a couple of gentle pats onto her back. 
Anthy quickly let go, and moved away once more to give her space. &quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re awake. 
Everyone will be so relieved!&quot; She exclaimed, wiping at her eyes a bit roughly. There were 
dark circles there, Utena noticed with a frown. Just how long had she been out. Asking the 
question aloud, Anthy answered.

&quot;Days...you&#39;ve been unconscious for about four days now. The castle half-thought you were 
dead and had returned to Dios. They feared retribution from the heavens. The other half was 
ready to start a full-on war against the Black Thorns, and tear apart the country-side to 
find every last one of them. General Saionji has been like a caged animal since the attack 
on the castle. And what with the politicians and the general panic and the&acirc;&#128;&#148;&quot; Steadily rising 
voice was silence as Utena put two fingers to her mouth to silence her. Holding up a hand to 
get her to pause a moment, the cyborg started them again more calmly.

&quot;What happened? The last thing I remember was racing to try and stop the tower roof from 
falling. I can&#39;t recall anything after climbing up the tower.&quot; And indeed her wired brain 
was furiously sifting about to retrieve any conclusive data from its memory banks. But all 
it could locate were fragmented bits of information and a lot of static. Had she suffered 
cranial damage? Anthy was looking at her strangely.

&quot;You don&#39;t remember? You saved us from being crushed, but you collapsed afterward. Miki and 
the remaining healers took Lord Touga and Baron Tsuchiya away. And it took four of the 
largest soldiers to lift and carry you back. Miki had us bring you to your quarters to look 
you over when we found damage to your armor. But it took him hours to figure out how to 
remove it. You were badly hurt...&quot; Her face looked sad.

The machines grafted into her body worked to assess her situation. She had sustained a bit 
of damage...mostly internal, due to pushing past her limits. But she&#39;d been 
desperate...angry. Emotional. Something that had always caused her problems in the past. And 
instead of following protocols the proper way, had taken on the entire army single-handedly 
and nearly lost Anthy because she had been just out of reach. Another second? Another second 
and she would have lost someone very dear to her. To the mission. But the programs that 
constantly ran in the background of her thoughts began to whisper reassuring instructions. 
If Anthy was lost, the mission wouldn&#39;t have to be sacrificed. There was still Akio, the 
true heir. The male. Anthy was only a Princess, and Utena was required to protect a 
War-Prince. There was a slight error there, but in the long run, perhaps it would have 
worked out better if...

Utena&#39;s mind recoiled at the coldness of that thought. It wasn&#39;t her own. But...wasn&#39;t it? 
Now? Wasn&#39;t she built that way now? Her head began to hurt more as an inner turmoil quietly 
began to struggle in the knot of her stomach. But a flood of chemicals immediately washed 
through her system and the feelings left. She was fine. Feelings were deleterious and 
useless . She needed to be focused.

Her body had eventually healed itself, it appeared. It simply must have required a shut down 
to divert all effort onto her reconstruction. Dangerous. There must have been a serious 
system crash if her neurobrain allowed her body to leave Anthy, Akio, and the kingdom 
unprotected without her. Or maybe I had felt she would be safe...I can&#39;t recall...

&quot;It&#39;s what I get for punching catapults.&quot; She muttered, not realizing she had spoken aloud 
again. Anthy looked up at her bewildered at what must have come out of sudden thin air from 
the long moment of silence.

&quot;I...er...what?&quot;

&quot;Catapults. I punched through the framework of a couple of the catapults, because they stood 
in my way when I felt my internal alarms go off. But I didn&#39;t see the scorpio. Silly of me. 
And that bolt really hurt.&quot;

&quot;...Was that what made that big hole in your back?&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes couldn&#39;t possibly get any 
wider.

&quot;Hmm. I&#39;ll admit it was a little reckless, milady. But I lost my temper. It is too bad my 
artillery gun didn&#39;t travel through time with me, or things would have been simpler. Swords 
take longer.&quot; Utena remarked thoughtfully, tapping her finger on her chin as she looked up 
at the tiled ceiling. The small room she was in had drapes on the walls depicting angels and 
holy saints. There was a strange symbol on the mantle of the altar behind her, replacing the 
traditional crosses she remembered from her own time. No doubt the symbol of Dios...

&quot;You...&quot; Utena looked down again to see Anthy with her head down and sighing. She looked 
drained, but still relieved to have the pink haired woman awake once more. &quot;Please 
promise...you will not do anything like that again. I lost years off of my life.&quot; She looked 
up and gave Utena&#39;s shoulders a small shake, forgetting formalities.

It made Utena smile. &quot;Is that an order?&quot;

The princess frowned. &quot;Yes. Please don&#39;t leave us like that again.&quot;

Utena nodded, still smiling as she put her hand up to her forehead in salute. &quot;Understood. 
Order received.&quot; They were interrupted as the masked guard returned leading an entourage 
consisting of Akio, his personal guard, Ruka, Miki, and a fellow swathed in robes and 
strings of beads. There was a mask covering everything but his mouth, but from the wrinkles 
that lined his hands and chin, Utena could discern that he must be quite old indeed.

&quot;Holy Guardian! You have returned to us once more. We are relieved.&quot; Akio proclaimed, 
smoothing down ruffled pale violet hair. The king looked as though he had just rolled out of 
bed. Seeming a bit harried himself, Ruka came forward and took a knee with the guards who 
came from the door to move further into the small room. They all bowed their heads 
reverently as the king kneeled and kissed Utena&#39;s hand. Anthy stepped inconspicuously away 
to the side to also bow her head. The priest was next, saying a small prayer as he gently 
grasped her hand with both of his wrinkled ones, and placed his forehead onto the back of 
it.

&quot;In Dios&#39; name, light hath returneth to our kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Amen.&quot; Came the murmur around the room.

Feeling very surreal, Utena kept the cloth covering her bandaged torso firmly in place. 
&quot;Please...rise.&quot; The group did so. &quot;I would like someone to explain what I&#39;m doing here. 
Where am I?&quot;

The priest eagerly stepped forward, the cloth prayer strips around his waist fluttering with 
each movement. &quot;Holy Warrior...thou glorious personage now resteth in the Inner Meditation 
Room of the Temple of the Rose. It was prepared when thou didst fall into deep slumber and 
did not awake. It was feared that thou coulds&#39;t not recover in mortal impure 
infirmaries...the Seiron-Lord Kaoru and I hads&#39;t thou brought here to this purified room 
that thou mayest rest and heal.

Utena felt that familiar tic in the corner of her eye. This guy was even worse than most of 
the castle servants...and pretty soon she&#39;d probably pick up his speech habits as well. 
Honestly it really hadn&#39;t mattered where they&#39;d put her, she could have repaired herself 
more than likely in any location. Everyone was so taken with this &quot;god&quot; business...

Feeling them awaiting her response, she gave a small cough and answered, &quot;Ah. I am most 
grateful. The purity of the room allowed me to connect my inner being with the healing power 
of Dios himself.&quot; Sweet lord, did I really say that? She felt a shame color her cheeks a 
touch. So embarrassing, but that should be enough for them. Yet the gross exaggeration left 
a funny taste in her mouth. And still...something wasn&#39;t quite right.

She looked down at herself trying to detect what was off. It was strange...everything was 
working fine, but...it felt like...something was there that hadn&#39;t been there before.

Dismissing the notion, she fired off her next questions.

&quot;Where is my armor?&quot;

&quot;Seiron-Lord Kaoru didth repair it and thy helm. It awaits in the chamber beyond.&quot;

&quot;My sword?&quot;

&quot;It has been enshrined in the castle hall. The nobles and servants feared that without its 
magic they would be lost while thou slumbered. One of the warrior monks shall fetch it 
immediately.&quot; One of the masked guards took off to do so.

&quot;And the enemy? What became of them?&quot; Here, the king answered smoothly, his strong dulcets 
reverberating in the room.

&quot;The Black Thorns have fled, completely decimated in the battle. Word has spread of your 
deeds, and many seek to join with us to fight back the threat to the north. My kingdom and I 
are eternally grateful for you assistance Great Guardian. A thousand blessings have truly 
fallen upon us with your continued protection.&quot;

&quot;Merely my duty. And Lord Kiryuu and Baron Tsuchiya are both alright?&quot;

King Akio smiled kindly. &quot;Indeed. A trip to the healers has repaired Touga&#39;s broken arm and 
fixed Ruka&#39;s ribs. They are both nearly completely healed.&quot;

Utena nodded, satisfied. &quot;Good. I am glad.&quot;

Akio looked her over, his face showing concern. &quot;Holy Guardian...are you healed then? I 
cannot beg your forgiveness enough, nor show you enough gratitude. I and my subjects are 
worried the Warrior of Dios will take offense and Dios himself will turn his back on us...&quot; 
But Utena shook her head and forestalled his next words.

&quot;I am fine now. I apologize for the length of time I slumbered, but I am at optimal 
efficiency now. I&#39;d like to retrieve my armor and some clothes please.&quot; Baron Tsuchiya rose 
and went to the door to call out to servants who must have been waiting beyond. The King 
offered a few more words and the priest stepped forward to offer a prayer over them while 
they waited. Then the two of them departed with their personal guard leaving Ruka to linger 
at the door way as four servants brought in Utena&#39;s ectosuit, helm, and sword. Anthy moved 
to stand near him as Utena inspected her belongings.

Beautiful...so beautiful... Utena thought as she swung her legs over the side of the altar 
and tied the thick red cloth around torso and over one shoulder like a toga. She moved to 
stand before the hulking suit, whose neckplate reached her eyes when she stood barefoot. The 
servants bowed several times, nearly knocking their foreheads onto the ground as she forgot 
everyone around her and moved to run a finger along the surface of her breastplate. So so 
beautiful... Miki was a genius. There was not one seam showing, not one crack left upon its 
surface. All of the holes were gone and the shoulder guards had been retrieved and repaired. 
The helm was whole and gleaming once more, and the sword had a shine of polish upon it. 
Sighing with relief she rested her forehead onto the armor and closed her eyes as she held 
the helm between her hands. A soft cough made her look up.

Ruka was still standing by the door, and looked as though he were debating about something. 
Finally coming to a decision he looked up into her eyes. The navy blue irises locked onto 
hers intensely. &quot;Lord Guardian...thank you.&quot; Utena gave him a puzzled look so he went on. 
&quot;Thank you for saving us. Not just the Princess, Lord Kiryuu, and myself. But for all of us 
in the castle...all of us in the town. You saved us, when no one else could have. I know it 
bothers General Kyouichi, but he&#39;s grateful too...you saved so many lives who would have 
been lost. Thank you. Thank you, Great One. You&#39;ve brought hope back to our people.&quot; As 
Utena watched she saw his eyes fill with tears. Shocked, she moved over to him and reached 
out to touch him, but he bowed his head and stepped away.

&quot;I was always a man of faith... My father raised my brothers and me to be strong leaders, 
dedicated to the protection of our lands and the worship of our god. But I never in all my 
years of prayer, in my required yearly pilgrimages, ever truly believed I would one day meet 
you. That you were truly real. That Dios wasn&#39;t just a pretty tale to keep us from 
committing acts of sin.&quot; He swiped at his eyes distractedly and turned to leave, his back to 
them.

&quot;I won&#39;t ever forget what you have done. And I will always serve you faithfully. The 
Tsuchiya family will forever honor you.&quot; And with that he swept out of the doorway.

Left alone with Anthy, Utena ran a hand through her hair feeling guilty and humbled. She 
liked Ruka, he had always seemed level-headed and kind. But honestly she didn&#39;t know how she 
felt about this new persona here in the past...future...whatever time period it was she was 
in. She felt so...alienated. And it wasn&#39;t a feeling that used to bother her a lot back 
home. Yet now...

A hand came and placed itself on the bandaged shoulder that peeked out from her wrap of red 
cloth.

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Anthy asked softly behind her.

&quot;Home. And the future I guess.&quot; Utena replied after a moment.

&quot;I see. Would you like a moment?&quot; Anthy asked cautiously, moving to draw back her hand. But 
a gentle pale hand placed itself over her own, keeping it there.

&quot;No. I&#39;ve had enough moments to last me. It&#39;s time to start moving forward.&quot;

Utena sighed and drew away from the warmth of Anthy&#39;s hand as she gave it a small pat, and 
began to head to the pile of clothes left on the altar for her. They were all of expensive 
cloth and silk, swirled with phoenixes and roses and contained a medallion of a carved 
wooden rose. Utena tossed the red cloth she had been wearing aside, long enough to start 
pulling on undergarments and breeches. She carefully removed wraps and bandages as she came 
to them, and sat down on the altar so that she could pull on her new boots. Her military 
uniform was probably a mess right now, and no doubt stolen by those crazy priests to be 
enshrined somewhere. She&#39;d have to retrieve it later on. Pausing as she was about to undo 
the wraps on her chest, Utena looked up to find Anthy watching her. There was something 
about the way Anthy&#39;s eyes tracked her movements that made her slow down.

&quot;Anthy?&quot;

The green-eyed woman looked up distractedly. &quot;Er, sorry. Yes?&quot;

Utena watched her silently for a moment, noticing perhaps for the first time how her cheeks 
flushed a little under the scrutiny, how her eyes were now anywhere but on Utena, and the 
more minute rises and falls of her chest. She trained her sensors on Anthy more 
closely...more closely than she had in the past. Instead of looking for wounds or checking 
her status, she looked for something else. Why had she never noticed before?

&quot;It&#39;s nothing, my Princess. Never mind.&quot;

Perhaps she had never wanted to notice. The ramifications were... Utena shook her head 
slightly to rid herself of the thought.

&quot;...Utena? Please. Please don&#39;t...call me that here...&quot;

But she looked up again as Anthy drew closer. Her eyes were soulful as she reached out to 
touch Utena&#39;s now-clothed shoulder. She was standing just before the cyborg, their faces 
level now with Utena sitting down on the altar. Utena&#39;s fingers stilled on the rim of her 
boot top as she finished tugging it up. Anthy&#39;s face was much closer than before. Very 
faintly she could smell scented oils. A mixing of amber and roses on her skin. The cyborg&#39;s 
head began to buzz slightly.

&quot;...Prin--&quot; Utena began again, but was halted as slender fingertips landed upon her lips. 
The words died in her throat. And the fingertips didn&#39;t leave.

&quot;Please. Not Princess. Not when we&#39;re alone. I can&#39;t bear it...&quot;

Utena looked up into those green eyes, her heart beginning to beat faster. They were too 
close. Far too close, she could feel the heat of Anthy&#39;s body just before her own. So close 
yet still not quite touching. All at once it was harder to swallow, and Utena licked her dry 
lips. The fingertips on her lips moved, and drew softly across the plane of one cheek. 
Tickling and unending until those slender fingers slipped behind her ear, and buried 
themselves to the thickness of her pink hair. Utena suppressed a shiver.

&quot;..A...Anthy...&quot; she rasped, her voice slightly husky now. &quot;...I-I...&quot; Anthy was leaning 
down before her, her other hand coming to match its twin as she cradled Utena&#39;s face to draw 
her closer.

&quot;...Anthy....&quot;

Those dark eyelashes were lowering themselves, and Utena could hear a second heartbeat that 
was beating even harder than her own. Crimson lips parted...

&quot;..Someone&#39;s coming.&quot;

And froze in shock. Rearing back as if she had been burned, Anthy barely had moved three 
steps away when the door burst open and a panting messenger entered.

&quot;M-m...hah hah...Milady hah Guardian! G-General Saionji sends you this hah m-message.&quot; He 
gave a bow and produced a sealed envelope. Utena took it, resisting the urge to cough in 
embarrassment. Glancing it over she gave a nod to the messenger boy who still did not raise 
his face to look at her directly.

&quot;Thank you. You may go.&quot;

The messenger bowed quickly several times and then fled. Utena sighed, running a hand 
through her tussled hair. The room was once again silent and still. She gave a sigh as she 
looked up from the letter in her hand. &quot;Hmmm...I wonder what he could possibly--&quot;

But her words were effectively cut off as Anthy now freely leaned in and pressed a hot mouth 
to hers. The letter slipped through fingers to flutter to the floor.

Anthy had pressed her body tight into Utena&#39;s chest, firmly leaning up against her body so 
that Utena&#39;s knees held her on either side of her hip. Her lips her soft and full, moving 
along the knight&#39;s as she gave a small noise in her throat. The princess drew the kiss to a 
close, parting slowly once again and blinking her eyes open. Heavy lidded, she gazed back at 
her holy protector...whose wide eyes and still outstretched hand showed her shock. Licking 
her damp lips, Anthy whispered her words just above Utena&#39;s own.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to just be a princess to you... And I don&#39;t want to lose to that Juri woman.&quot; 
Her voice was like sultry velvet rubbing inside of Utena&#39;s skull. And the way she cocked her 
head just so...so that the light spilled across her smooth skin in a play of shadow and 
flesh was...expert. Was done with the ease of practice. Utena trembled.

Then, suddenly, Anthy moved back as if to leave. She turned her head, the toss of her hair 
sending a fragrant perfume wafting across Utena&#39;s sense. She could taste roses in the air. 
But before Anthy could complete the turn fully, she was jerked to a halt as Utena&#39;s knees 
tightened like a vice. Anthy turned back, her eyes burning with naked desire. Instead of 
leaving, she turned back into the circle of her knights thighs. Utena trembled again as she 
felt something rising in her. What am I doing? What am I...this isn&#39;t...

Utena stretched out a hand slowly, barely moving in the air before them. As if Anthy were 
too fragile to touch. As if the touch of her hand could send her shattering like glass. A 
wash of reflexive chemicals tried to suppress the sudden surge of emotions that now burned 
within Utena&#39;s cybernetic veins. But they were overloaded by a desire that poured through 
her body like molten fire. A desire she hadn&#39;t felt ache in her since...Dios.

A low growl in her throat, Utena&#39;s eyes flared with blue flame as she lunged forward. Moving 
impossibly fast for the human eye. Anthy gave a small gasp as she was pulled forcefully back 
into the cyborg&#39;s body for a second searing kiss. As their mouths worked at each other Anthy 
moaned again, louder, as Utena&#39;s hands found their way along her neck and lower back. When 
they parted, Anthy swayed slightly and Utena felt her cheeks flush hotly.

&quot;And you think to just...make that sort of declaration...and walk off?&quot; Utena asked 
breathlessly. &quot;Just a sly sort of kiss and then steal away to your room? Who do you think 
you&#39;re dealing with here?&quot;

That buzzing in her head was far far louder now. It was starting to make her loose focus of 
her surroundings. But Anthy was pushing into her body, her hands fisting into her shirt and 
pulling her down to her lips. Somewhere in her mind, Dios was still smiling and calling to 
her in her memories. And she felt her heart give a hard lurch. What was she doing? This 
wasn&#39;t right, this was against everything she&#39;d been taught! But the apprehension was 
overpowered by the feeling of dainty small hands moving low on her backside and giving a 
tight squeeze. Utena groaned and hooked a leg around Anthy&#39;s body to pull her in even 
tighter. She could feel a hot need surging from deep within her core, sending electricity 
through her scalp as Utena left a flurry of kisses along Anthy&#39;s collar bone. She moved in 
to lick up the shell of her ear causing Anthy to gasp loudly. The cinnamon-skinned woman&#39;s 
eyes rolled into the back of her head.

&quot;A-Ah! Ah! Nnnnngh...I couldn&#39;t tell you...it ssssssswasn&#39;t right!&quot; She hissed suddenly as 
Utena sucked onto the pulse of her neck, hot and insistent.

&quot;Is now more right?&quot; Utena gritted her teeth in concentration as Anthy bucked her hips in 
response. The powerful throb between her thighs gave a new surge, sending a spike of arousal 
up her spine. Anthy wrapped her arms around her neck and dove in for her mouth once more. 
The silence was broken by the quiet sounds of sliding cloth and ragged panting. Utena gave 
an mmmmm of delight as Anthy drew back to gaze at her face.

&quot;No...but gods above, I can&#39;t hold back anymore! It&#39;s blasphemy...but I&#39;m already damned...&quot; 
With that cryptic statement she moved in for another kiss. &quot;And I can&#39;t stop dreaming of 
you.&quot; The desire was thick enough in her voice to make Utena shiver again. But before she 
could say anything back, a loud knock came at the door.

&quot;Holy Guardian! Have you finished?&quot;

Utena blanched and shot a look at the door. She hadn&#39;t heard anyone approach!

&quot;She is ready now.&quot; Anthy called out loud, and the body at the door retreated slightly. 
Cursing softly under her breath, Anthy withdrew.

&quot;I better go. Everyone is waiting for you.&quot; And pausing at the doorway to look back over her 
shoulder, the dark princess bit her bottom lip and exited the room.

Left alone and breathing hard in her sprawling position on the altar, Utena looked down at 
her rumpled clothing and the letter on the floor. And flopped back on the altar to cover her 
face with her arms. The chemicals pumping through her veins was enough to make her vision 
swim, as calculations angrily buzzed inside of her pupils. Her system was restoring order 
once more...and it wasn&#39;t happy. That is if, emotionless silicon and circuitry were capable 
of such feelings. She was breaching the barrier between Guardian and Charge...and betraying 
Dios&#39; memory. All at once a wash of sadness leaked through the still burning embers of 
lingering lust. She heard the ghost of youthful laughter echo through her thoughts, and his 
image overlapped Anthy&#39;s in her minds eye. Her guts twisted again as she closed her eyes 
tightly.

&quot;....Shit.&quot;

Down the winding castle hallways, Anthy hurriedly made her way past bustling servants as she 
headed for her new temporary quarters. She barely noticed as the men and women bowed and 
moved out of her way. But one individual did not, and as it detached itself from the wall it 
had been leaning against, Juri Arisugawa moved to intersect the Princess&#39; path.

&quot;Princess. Heading somewhere awfully quickly are we not?&quot; The tawny woman commented 
sarcastically, raising an eyebrow. Anthy halted and looked up at her. For a moment neither 
said anything. But then Anthy gave a bright sunny smile, causing Juri to blink in surprise.

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

And off she went again down the hall. Baffled Juri took a step after her, suspicious and a 
little bewildered.

Hmm&#39;? Just what does that mean? She&#39;s up to something... But Anthy was already gone. Looking 
back at the direction Anthy had come from, Juri crossed her arms. What on the green earth 
had her...smiling like that? Juri couldn&#39;t remember ever having seen her smile. Not once. 
Not honestly anyway. It had been pretty, Juri noted, then immediately scowled. Tapped her 
chin absently she strode off down the hall to go and find those dignitaries she was supposed 
to meet.

Then she paused a moment and looked over her shoulder suspiciously as Utena left the room 
Anthy had come from, seemingly in a daze as she put on her helm. Juri&#39;s eyes narrowed as the 
armored Guardian turned the corner and disappeared.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Having finally pulled herself together enough to actually leave the indoor shrine room, 
Utena found herself flanked by guards who walked with heads held high. A dozen or so 
servants once more halted in their duties in order to fling their bodies to the floor and 
offer prayers of thanksgiving in her passing. Wakaba was nowhere in sight, Utena noted with 
a bit of loneliness. The faces in the crowded hallway blurred together as Utena pushed 
herself onward. She was once more completely encased in her armor, the helm back in place 
and her cape swirling with every step. Safely concealed and able to mull over her own 
thoughts, she brooded as her feet took her in the direction of the barracks outside.

Coming to the squat spartan stone building, a pair of crossed swords over top of the large 
wooden door, Utena paused as one of her escorts detached from her side to announce her 
presence. There was a moment, and then Saionji himself burst out of the barracks looking 
winded and wild. Wearing a sort of cloth skirt and sash across his chest, a couple other men 
(dressed similarly) came out behind him.

They all looked apprehensive as Saionji rose up to his full height and glared at the cyborgs 
electric blue eyes, shining from the dark holes of her helm. The two stared at each other, 
and the men surrounding them took a step back tensely. Utena didn&#39;t move, holding his gaze 
and waiting to see what he would do. But then he lunged out an open hand between them and 
waited. Feeling surprised, Utena struck out her own hand and the two of the clasped each 
other on the forearm. Saionji gave a small quirk of a smile.

Ignoring the men who seemed to sag in relief, Saionji pulled the fully armored knight into 
him, giving a clanging slap on her back before releasing her. &quot;Looks as though you took your 
time waking up. Lazy clod.&quot;

Lifting her visor, Utena blinked. Then relaxed into a smirk. &quot;Well I figured I&#39;d let you do 
some kind of work for awhile. Instead of you slacking off to dance around in your pretty 
skirt.&quot;

Not the slightest bit embarrassed, he gave a wave of dismissal. &quot;It is the mark of our 
people to wear our traditional kilts during war meetings. Which reminds me, these are my 
countrymen.&quot; He gestured behind him to the stone-faced men that waited behind him. &quot;From the 
highlands of Kyou, a bit of a distance from Ohtori. We were just finishing up a meeting of 
clan heads.&quot; The three men nodded and signaled their desire to leave. Saionji nodded and 
spoke in a rapid tongue as he clapped arms with his fellows. When they had left, Saionji 
signaled Utena&#39;s guards to disperse and the two were left alone. Removing his sash and rough 
white undershirt, he motioned Utena to follow him inside.

&quot;When I came here to Ohtori, it was for many reasons. With many burdens as well. But from 
that I eventually became a general with a host of men to lead. And then I was made the royal 
liaison between my people and the king. An honor in other&#39;s eyes perhaps. But I don&#39;t think 
my people have forgiven me yet...&quot; He trailed off, not speaking more. Utena turned her back 
politely as Saionji changed clothes, donning the traditional military garb that was what she 
was used to seeing. She then followed him outside as he headed for the training grounds.

&quot;Things are heating up. I don&#39;t know if you know or not. But the King is moving on with his 
plans for crushing our northern foes and this underground band of killers. The Black 
Thorns.&quot; Saionji spat on the ground at the name. &quot;This...cowardly attack on our people 
brings us shame. That it was successful, and we could not stop them? More so.&quot; His face 
darkened with rage, but glancing at Utena it melted into a look of tiredness. &quot;Your 
assistance was vital...but my men should have been able to hold them back. I can&#39;t 
understand how they could have slipped through our defenses so easily!&quot;

They wandered over to the side of one of the practice rings, and Saionji leaned his forearms 
onto it. His expression was faraway, lost in his own thoughts as he spoke aloud his 
concerns. &quot;I thank you for coming. I don&#39;t like you, and I never did. But I can respect your 
strength. To my people, strength is everything. While I do not think you a god, I do think 
you are touched by something divine. Perhaps the Fair Lady herself. But I fear...it will not 
be enough now.&quot; He brushed his hair out of his face, and scratched his chin.

&quot;What do you mean? Do you think those Black Thorns are planning something more?&quot; Utena 
asked, her own eyes narrowing.

&quot;The attack on the castle... It was too quick. Too abrupt. As if they had popped out of the 
ground like daisies with swords. The mage-boy Miki suggests that the mages were able to 
cloak their warriors and enter undetected into the castle town. But I ask you, can such 
mages exist that Miki&#39;s own magical defenses would not have detected?&quot;

Utena hesitated and thought it over. Granted she didn&#39;t know the lad well or what he was 
capable of. Except that the rest of the castle regarded him with awe and fear. And he had 
fixed her armor when blacksmiths could not. Saionji gave her a shrewd look and lowered his 
voice.

&quot;I think something more is at work here. I think we have spies amongst us.&quot; Saionji hissed, 
casting his eyes about. Utena held back a huff of disbelief when she noticed Saionji 
intensely looking at her.

&quot;They knew to attack certain prime buildings, and what our patrol schedule was. They came 
not from a pure direction, but were filtered about and spread across the town. They were at 
our outer-gates far too quickly, and they attacked our munitions building. Setting fire to 
costly equipment and war machines before we finally put them out.&quot; As he spoke, his voice 
grew softer and his expression turned dark.

&quot;And...the tower. Anthy&#39;s tower. Perhaps it was coincidence, but they attacked the tower 
while she was inside. I don&#39;t know...but there are too many possibilities for my liking, and 
not enough answers for my questions.&quot;

His voice fell away on the breeze as they both considered the implications. Finally Utena, 
her cybernetic brain working through a variety of scenarios, spoke. Her voice was cool as 
she asked, &quot;And...have we any suspects?&quot;

Saionji shook his head. &quot;Not as of yet. I&#39;d like to keep this quiet. Root out the rats and 
find out where their nest is.&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes became hard as ice, Saionji noted, as a small smile tugged at her lips. &quot;Sounds 
fun. And it also sounds like we have our work cut out for us. I don&#39;t take kindly to fools 
attacking those I lend my protection to.&quot; Saionji, privately grateful for the &quot;we&quot;, couldn&#39;t 
help but wonder what sort of beast lay behind that smile.

&quot;Then I can count on your assistance?&quot;

Utena nodded once. &quot;Of course. I will do my utmost to help. And I&#39;ll keep a sharper ear to 
the ground.&quot;

Saionji nodded to himself, still frowning. He opened his mouth to say something, but then 
seemed to change his mind. Struggling visibly with something, Utena looked at him through 
her flipped-up visor.

&quot;Was there something else you wanted to discuss?&quot;

Saionji stilled, his head bent so that his long green hair covered his eyes. Then looking up 
he seemed to make a decision. &quot;Yes...but knowing you you&#39;re not going to like it.&quot; His 
violet his met hers seriously, willing her to listen. &quot;It&#39;s about Anthy. And the danger she 
is to us all.&quot;

Utena immediately frowned, hackles raising. But she steeled herself to keep her composure. 
&quot;Oh? And how is it she is a danger?&quot; Saionji sighed, his face troubled.

&quot;There are things going on, Guardian. Things beneath the layers of Ohtori and its people. 
But I have been sworn not to speak of it.&quot; He bit his lip, drawing Utena in despite herself. 
He seemed genuinely worried about something. What on earth was he hedging about? Suddenly he 
reached out to Utena and clasped her wrist.

&quot;But please listen and heed my damn words, you thick bucket of tin! Anthy isn&#39;t human. And 
hasn&#39;t ever been I think...&quot;

Utena forcibly jerked her arm away, unhappy. &quot;Is that so. One of these...&quot;Magik&quot; users 
right? I think that was fairly obvious after that show during our duel.&quot;

Saionji shook his head in negative. &quot;No. The green god&#39;s mercy if she were. That woman isn&#39;t 
something so...so commonplace. No, she&#39;s the taint of darkness on her soul. A consort to 
evil of the most unspeakable sort. She communed with demons during her girlhood, and even 
now...despite all you&#39;ve done, despite dragging her out from the shadows where she belonged 
she is still blackened for it!&quot;

Utena gripped his collar, bringing his face very close to hers. &quot;Watch what you say, filthy 
pig-headed--&quot;

&quot;No YOU watch what you say!&quot; He snarled, and gripped her neck plate with his bare hands. He 
gave a slight jerk and leaned in, and her eyes caught a slight movement with his hand. Yet 
his face took most of her attention. His eyes were wild with anger. But underneath it, 
perceptible only to her keener-than-average sight, was fear.

&quot;That...t-that she-demon! Haven&#39;t you ever wondered?! Ever thought to ask why she was out 
casted? Passed around like a whore, despite being a noble?!&quot; Utena shoved him off, and 
slammed down her visor, putting a hand onto her sword hilt. But Saionji just regarded her 
with disgust.

&quot;You are so wrapped up within her sweet words and star-touched eyes. But perhaps you should 
wonder why she would give her body up to the devil&#39;s own...including her brother--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough! I will hear no more of this slander!&quot; Utena sharply cut in, her own anger 
rising, &quot;I warn you...I will aide you against this kingdom&#39;s threat. But I will not hear 
anymore talk about my Charge in such a fashion. Lest I have to part your head from your 
shoulders to make my point.&quot; Utena&#39;s voice crackled with energy. But Saionji merely shook 
his head and walked away.

&quot;Don&#39;t come crying to me later when that wench proves me right. She&#39;s trouble. Always has 
been. Even to bed her was a curse they say... And maybe that curse is why everything has 
gone wrong.&quot;

Saionji turned his back and walked away, leaving Utena standing there trembling with rage. 
How dare that arrogant stupid bastard call her out here only to spit out more of his poison! 
And just when she had thought he wasn&#39;t a complete waste of time. A couple of crows cawed 
from the tree tops, and Utena looked up to glower at them from behind her gargoyle-like face 
mask. They took wing and flapped noisily away to another, safer, roost.

Straightening, she brushed his invisible filth off of the collar of her armor. But stopped 
as her fingers brushed something. There was a small crumpled piece of parchment wadded up, 
just along her neck where Saionji gripped her. Did he purposefully place it there? She moved 
to inspect it, bringing it closer to her eyes. Then her fingers moved to partially unwrap it 
to reveal a spidery handwriting. Handwriting her mind-wired computer was able to recognize 
as the same from the note that asked her to meet the rude general in the first place. But an 
internal warning kept her from opening it. If he had slipped her that note in the midst of 
their argument...an argument he might have known was sure to happen due to his reluctance to 
bring up the subject...then he did it to conceal the note altogether. Perhaps from prying 
eyes?

Warily looking about her, without turning her head or body, Utena didn&#39;t detect anyone 
spying. And opening up her circuit pathways to expand her senses outward, nothing living was 
detected within a radius of fifty yards. Nothing except some birds and a cat or two. But 
from past experience, she knew that might not mean anything if they had a scope of some kind 
or a spycam placed somewhere. And surely these people were advanced enough to know how to 
make a telescope. Right? She refused to even consider magikal methods. It just made her head 
ache.

Deciding it was best to be safe than sorry later, she casually slipped the note into her 
glove and headed for the castle stables. The horses fascinated her, as they were a rarity 
back in her own time. And she needed a moment not out in the open. Moving to place her body 
near a brown mare, who sniffed her warily for any treats she may have been hiding under all 
of that spiky metal, Utena slipped out the note in between them to quickly read and copy 
with her eye&#39;s camera mode. The note was brief:

&quot;Darkness lies beneath the surface of this castle. Check behind the glass to find the true 
reflection.&quot;--S

And that was it. What sort of games was he playing at now? Why the riddle? Was he afraid of 
the note being found? There didn&#39;t seem anything odd about it, other than its wording. The 
wording wasn&#39;t something in Kyouichi&#39;s character. Was it a clue? But to what?

Feeling the wispy touch of what appeared to be the edges of some dark conspiracy, Utena 
stepped out of the stable and looked up at the broken tower high above. Workers were even 
now hauling up stone on wenches and platforms. While the tower was being rebuilt Anthy had 
no doubt been moved elsewhere. But it still was a painful reminder to see what she had 
almost lost. Anthy...

Feeling troubled, Utena turned her attention up at the sky. Then she tossed the scrap of 
paper into a nearby by brazier. Silently watching it burn out of the corner of her eye, 
Utena waited until it flared up and crinkled away into nothing but ash.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Touga Kiryuu watched Saionji stride across the field, barking orders at his soldiers from a 
terrace ledge above. Beside him sat a report that he needed to bring to the king.

&quot;Haaaaah. So much work still to do. Eh, Ruka?&quot;

The blue-haired man was reclined on a seat, enjoying a cup of wine. &quot;Yes. The rebuilding 
will take time and be costly. Not to mention that we must still make ready for the feast 
that the king still insists on. The taxes from our dear people will need to be taken into 
consideration unfortunately.&quot; His tone was said nothing. The foppish man enjoying the 
morning sun on his skin as he listened to the soldier&#39;s chanting their drills. &quot;I can 
understand the king wanting to show strength and build up morale by having this feast...but 
really it could wait. We need to insure our own protection is secure, not to mention all of 
the preparations and housing for our guests--&quot;

&quot;Come come Ruka, when has one ever been able to talk sensibly to the nobility? Their 
majesties will do what they wish. And we are left to perform miracles.&quot; Touga laughed, 
seemingly unconcerned. Ruka frowned.

&quot;Yes, but--&quot;

&quot;Now surely the castle is plenty big to support an entire populace. And our coffers are 
hardly small. I think a grand party is just what we all need right now. And with our fine 
general and our holy Guardian to protect us, I doubt the Black Thorns will bother to show 
their faces!&quot;

Ruka sighed, feeling tired. &quot;You just want an excuse to dress up and chase skirts...&quot;

&quot;Undoubtedly! But it is all in the name of our political advancements I assure you.&quot; Touga 
gave a winning smile, his long red hair currently tied up into a high ponytail. &quot;Besides you 
need to loosen up a bit. Ever since that dear Lady Tsuchiya passed away six years ago, Dios 
guard her soul, you&#39;ve been like a ghost. It&#39;ll do you some good to get out of the church 
sometimes and mingle with your fellow human beings.&quot;

Ruka tiredly ran a hand over his face as Touga came up beside him to clasp him warmly on the 
shoulder. &quot;And the council misses seeing you at these functions. It&#39;ll be nice to chat over 
hor d&#39;oeuvres and ale. Outside of stuffy paperwork and dull meetings.&quot;

Ruka sighed. &quot;Yes. I suppose you are right. You are as vile a tempter as always.&quot; He cracked 
a smirk and gave a laugh.

Touga joined in heartily, &quot;Naturally!&quot; Ruka finished his wine and stood to leave, giving a 
farewell over his shoulder as he departed. Touga smiled until the door closed. Then he 
sighed and slid the report next to him aside. Beneath it was a second.

&quot;Sorry about that. I didn&#39;t expect him to drop in for a social visit. Ruka&#39;s been on edge 
since the attack, I think it really shook him up.&quot;

A figure detached from a concealed hideaway within the wall, the stone sliding soundlessly. 
It moved to take the papers and slip them into its jacket.

&quot;Hmm. The king&#39;s lack of action is disturbing, even though he knew we were coming. He&#39;s up 
to something no doubt.&quot;

&quot;No doubt.&quot; Touga drawled, his face bored.

The figure, small and petite and very feminine, pulled up her face mask and headed back to 
the secret corridor in the wall. &quot;The Black Thorns appreciate your assistance as always, 
Lord Kiryuu. But be careful not to be caught in your own games.&quot;

Smiling and giving a small wave to the girl as she disappeared, Touga smirked and picked up 
the report for the king. He had done his part to supply the Black Thorns with what they 
needed. Akio would be pleased.

All in the name of our political advancements...Naturally.
