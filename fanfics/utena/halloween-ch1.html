<h1>Halloween</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;This is REALLY embarrassing,&quot; Utena Tenjou murmured, the pink haired 
woman looking down disapprovingly at the dress she was wearing. In fact 
she had even worn it once before, the pink monstrosity that Touga Kiryuu 
had insisted she wear for the ball. &#145;Though I think Anthy may have added 
a few extra ruffles,&#39; Utena mused.

&quot;I think it looks lovely,&quot; Anthy Himemiya said mildly, the dusky skinned 
purple haired young woman reaching up to adjust her thin red tie. Rather 
atypically Anthy was dressed in a elegant suit, the black cloth hugging 
her slim body along with a few rose highlights, like her tie and cuff 
links.

&quot;On you, maybe,&quot; Utena chuckled. They walked to the door of their dorm 
room as she asked, &quot;So who&#39;s idea was this again?&quot;

&quot;The chairman&#39;s,&quot; Anthy answered as she politely opened the door for 
her.

&quot;Taking the part to heart?&quot; Utena asked with a smile. &quot;And does the 
slimeball have anything interesting planned for tonight?&quot; she wondered.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Anthy admitted.

Utena nodded seriously, &quot;Then we&#39;d better be prepared.&quot;

As they walked out of the dorm building, Utena mused on how her opinion 
of the Chairman Akio Ohtori had so radically changed. Maybe it had been 
chance that caused her to walk in on him and his mother in law, maybe it 
was fate, but seeing him being so blatantly unfaithful to his fianc&eacute; had 
really opened her eyes. Now she was far more aware of his plotting, 
though what his ultimate goal was remained unknown.

&quot;Utena-san, wait up,&quot; a very annoying voice called.

Utena winced. Ever since Touga Kiryuu had lost to her he had declared 
himself her follower, and had even moved in to the dorm with them. Not 
that she minded, exactly, but he hogged the hot shower water, not to 
mention dragging much more of the student council craziness into their 
lives.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I caught up to you,&quot; Touga cheerfully noted as both Anthy and 
Utena gazed in shock at his outfit. He wore a dress that matched the one 
that utena did, realistic falsies giving him decent looking breasts, and 
a lovely pink flower nestled in his perfectly styled hair.

&quot;I&#39;m almost glad to see someone who looks more foolish than I do,&quot; Utena 
admitted after a moment as they fell into step together.

&quot;You wound me,&quot; Touga murmured, amusement twinkling in his eyes.

Anthy smiled cheerfully, &quot;I think he looks adorable.&quot;

Touga chuckled softly as they passed beneath a arch leading towards the 
school buildings and the Halloween Ball, &quot;What every man wants to hear 
himself described as.&quot; He looked over at Utena and smiled charmingly, 
&quot;May I have a dance tonight?&quot;

Utena rolled her eyes as she pointedly took Anthy&#39;s hand and said to 
him, &quot;Sorry, my dance card is full.&quot;

&quot;Pity,&quot; Touga mused.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Utena looked him over, &quot;we&#39;d probably trip over each other&#39;s 
skirts.&quot;

Touga chuckled as they reached the building where a brown haired girl 
held the main doors open, &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Wakaba smiled at them wryly, dressed in boy&#39;s jeans, T-shirt 
and a matching jacket. Her long hair had been tied back and greased a 
bit, making her look much more boyish than she usually did.

&quot;I&#39;d jump on you for a change,&quot; Utena looked amused, &quot;but I can barely 
move in this dress, much less jump.&quot;

Wakaba snickered, &quot;I&#39;ll look you up later.&quot;

Inside, the crowd was a riot of gender bent colors as the young men and 
women of Ohtori mingled and talked. Miki Kaoru looked extremely 
uncomfortable in his girl&#39;s uniform, while his twin fumed in the 
background as he drew more attention than she did. Nanami Kiryuu had 
exchanged her usual feminine garb for a altered version of Touga&#39;s usual 
wear, drawing the adoring glances of her usual group of followers.

&quot;Poor Saionji,&quot; Touga snickered softly.

The green haired kendoist Saionji had decided on wearing a black 
mini-dress, even shaving his legs for the occassion, but it really 
didn&#39;t suit him. Stalking over he growled darkly, &quot;When I find Ohtori 
he&#39;s a dead man.&quot;

&quot;Nice legs,&quot; Utena smirked.

&quot;Shut up, Tenjou,&quot; Saionji scowled, more than a bit distracted by Anthy 
in a suit.

&quot;Don&#39;t speak that way about my Utena,&quot; Anthy warned, taking Utena&#39;s hand 
and then linking arms with her.

&quot;Cute, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Touga remarked, &quot;I think Anthy&#39;s suit is getting to 
her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not the only one,&quot; Saionji noted, nodding towards where Juri was 
standing.

The already notorious &#145;big lesbian on campus&#39; Juri Arisugawa was dressed 
in black leather pants and jacket, a ivory white shirt hugging her 
breasts. Not too surprisingly she was drawing a admiring crowd, 
including a few of Touga&#39;s usual girl groupies.

&quot;I think I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Utena admitted after a moment, a decidedly odd 
tone appearing in her voice.

Anthy looked over at her in surprise as she murmured, &quot;Utena!&quot;

Before Utena could reply Miki swished over, the blue haired boy looking 
very feminine in his matching dress. &quot;Help,&quot; he whispered, a group of 
male admirers trailing after him along with a clearly annoyed Kozue in 
his normal uniform.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Touga gave the men a winning smile as he put his arm across 
Miki&#39;s shoulders, &quot;you&#39;re bothering my date.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Miki muttered as the disappointed men left.

Touga smiled down at him with a predatory look as he dangerously purred, 
&quot;Don&#39;t be too thankful yet, Miki.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Miki paled.

&quot;Kidding,&quot; Touga laughed as he seemed to switch of his sexual energy 
with ease. Several yaoi fangirls sighed, disappointed there wouldn&#39;t be 
a scene.

&quot;I wish I could do that,&quot; Saionji confessed with some reluctance.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more of this I can stand,&quot; Utena muttered, 
shaking her head.

Anthy smiled as she offered Utena a white gloved hand, &quot;I can hear the 
music starting... may I have this dance?&quot;

Utena took it, curtseying as she said, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;

As soft music played in the background Utena and Anthy swayed together, 
even as others hurried out to join them. Anthy lead with unusual skill, 
guiding Utena across the floor as she held the other woman tenderly 
close, her smile warmer than it usually was.

&quot;You&#39;re very good at this,&quot; Utena murmured as she let Anthy guide her 
across the floor.

Anthy actually blushed a bit as she said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She smiled 
slightly, &quot;I practiced a while with Chu Chu.&quot;

Utena chuckled, &quot;Then thank Chu Chu for me.&quot;

&quot;And what do I get?&quot; Anthy asked as she gently spun Utena around then 
drew her close.

Utena settled close, wrapping her arms around Anthy&#39;s neck. &quot;Ask me 
tonight,&quot; she whispered in her ear.

A drum roll cut off any response the blushing Anthy could make as the 
lights dimmed and a spotlight shone. &quot;Let us all welcome the master of 
ceremonies,&quot; the young man&#39;s voice boomed, &quot;Akio Ohtori.&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Miki breathed out in shock as he appeared.

Akio stepped out of the shadows dressed as DR. Frank-N-Furter of Rocky 
Horror Picture Show, including black leather corset and panties, 
overdone make up and a black haired wig. He looked eerily androgenous, 
as well as disturbingly handsome. :&quot;Welcome all,&quot; he smiled, &quot;to the 
Halloween Ball!&quot;

&quot;I wonder if he chose this theme just so he could wear that?&quot; Utena 
wondered aloud.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised,&quot; Anthy admitted. Silently she mused, &#145;He&#39;s 
growing more unstable since Utena slipped from his grip... what are we 
going to do if it gets worse?&#39;

The End...?

Notes: Touga living at the dorm with Utena is a manga concept that 
amused me, while Juri-as-lesbian is a anime/movie concept. May expand on 
this later, maybe.</pre>
