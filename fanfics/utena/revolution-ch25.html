<a href="../utena/revolution-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>&quot;Well,&quot; Dorothy Catelonia said as the bitter smoke of
battle drifted through the air, &quot;I suppose it will
have to do.&quot; The blonde stood by her Tallgeese unit on
the broken street, the inside of the colony L1-BO4467
now battered and broken by their invasion.

Docking their shuttles peacefully the OZ troops had
launched a surprise blitz of the command decks of the
outer colony defenses, then moved in the waiting troop
shuttles. The residents of the peaceful colony had
been woefully unprepared for war, and the take over
had been painless... at least for the OZ troops.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Helen hurried to her side, the black haired
officer dressed in her snug uniform, &quot;we&#39;ve found a
facility to use as a command center.&quot;

&quot;Make sure that we have a solid communications link
with Meuller in the outer defense headquarters,&quot;
Dorothy ordered briskly as she and a team of
bodyguards followed Helen, &quot;I don&#39;t want any
surprises.&quot;

Helen touched the earpiece she wore, &quot;Tech teams are
already moving.&quot; She paused, &quot;Ma&#39;am, why not use the
moon base?&quot;

&quot;I wondered when you&#39;d ask,&quot; Dorothy smiled slightly.
Seriously she said, &quot;The moon base is less defensible,
and if Une attacks again I want a location we can
evacuate quickly.&quot;

Helen dropped her voice a bit, &quot;You&#39;re certain it was
Une?&quot;

&quot;Trant seemed fairly certain,&quot; Dorothy kept any trace
of grief for the lost officer out of her voice, &quot;and
he was a reliable man.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Helen agreed as they made their way to the
nearby building Helen had chosen. Picked for both how
it could be defended as well as rapid access to their
Mobile Suits, it was a bit of a compromise. Built into
a false hill it almost looked like a bunker, but it
had been intended for a user who wanted to be close to
&#39;nature.&#39;

&quot;What&#39;s the status of the pilots?&quot; Dorothy asked
crisply.

Helen pursed her lips as they went into the office she
intended to give to Dorothy. &quot;Shiori had one of her
moments again,&quot; she said flatly, &quot;she slashed a nurse
quite badly.&quot;

Dorothy sighed, once more wondering if Shiori was
really worth the trouble. &quot;And the others?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Winner continues to test out well in the Gemini,&quot;
Helen consulted her notes, &quot;but we lack elite pilots
for our surviving Tallgeese units.&quot;

&quot;I never should have lost Po and Noin,&quot; Dorothy made a
face.

&quot;Meuller is qualified...&quot; Helen offered tentatively.

Dorothy shook her head, &quot;No, his main loyalty is to
Treise&#39;s faction in OZ. I can&#39;t give him such a weapon
until I know which way he&#39;ll jump.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; one of her engineers, Maiser, stuck his head
in the door, &quot;we&#39;ve reestablished contact with Earth!&quot;

&quot;Oh lovely,&quot; Dorothy muttered, taking a moment to tidy
her hair and uniform. Activating the standard
communications rig built into the desk she said,
&quot;Earth Command, this is Captain Dorothy Catalonia.&quot;

&quot;Hello Dorothy,&quot; Treise Khushrenada smiled, the brown
haired officer back in uniform and sitting in the
command center.

Dorothy clenched her fists hard, but kept them out of
sight under the table as she thought, &#39;How did he
maneuver back into power?!&#39; Keeping her confusion off
her face she nodded respectfully, &quot;I regret to inform
you Fortress Barge has been destroyed.&quot;

&quot;We received the distress signal a short time ago,&quot;
Treise agreed. He frowned exaggeratedly and added,
&quot;The involvement of my former subordinate is
disturbing, so much so Romafeller asked me to assist
them.&quot;

&#39;I wonder if you knew this would happen...?&#39; Dorothy
mused as she maintained her poker face. &quot;As a
emergency measure we&#39;ve taken over colony L1-BO4467 as
a base of operations, and we&#39;re requesting
reinforcements.&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t be easy,&quot; Treize answered, &quot;we&#39;re
struggling to recoup losses of ships and men from
previous campaigns. However, we&#39;ll send what we can.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dorothy answered as she thought,
&#39;Obviously, you&#39;re putting me on the back burner, damn
you.&#39; Aloud she asked, &quot;What are your orders?&quot;

&quot;Hold you position, refuel and rearm,&quot; Treise ordered,
&quot;we need to see how the situation develops before we
act.&quot;

&quot;Understood, Catalonia out,&quot; she said formally.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Sally,&quot; Noin said quietly, the black haired woman
leaning against the wall of their cell, &quot;I&#39;ve made up
my mind.&quot;

Sally Po looked up, her long brown hair a mess as she
asked, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;The information the Gundams have given us,&quot; Noin
looked pained, &quot;it&#39;s not faked. Oz and Earth have
committed atrocities... hell, I was there to stop a
massacre at one point.&quot;

&quot;You think it&#39;s time to...?&quot; Sally asked, a little
surprised that in the weeks since their last
conversation on the subject Noin could change so.

&quot;I can&#39;t fight for OZ any more,&quot; Noin confessed her
feelings with a sigh, &quot;if nothing else, Dorothy saw to
that.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get someone&#39;s attention,&quot; Sally smiled.

Noin and Sally got up, taking turns banging on the
doors as Noin asked, &quot;Not going to talk me out of it?&quot;

&quot;I hate to say it,&quot; Sally banged the wall as she said,
&quot;but I made my mind up weeks back. I was just waiting
for you.&quot;

&quot;I get the odd feeling I was just insulted,&quot; Noin
muttered. Hammering on the door she yelled, &quot;Hey,
guard!&quot;

A few moment&#39;s later the window in the door opened up
as Duo Maxwell looked at them cheerfully. &quot;Sorry,
folks, the guards are kinda busy.&quot; The brown haired
young man smiled charmingly, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Sally said, looking pointedly at Noin.

Noin took a deep breath then said, &quot;As a officer of
the Specials... I&#39;d like to defect to the colony
forces.&quot;

&quot;Seriously,&quot; Duo perked up. He paused a moment in
thought, &quot;Do ya think you could hold out another
week?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Sally blinked.

&quot;I bet on you lasting that long,&quot; Duo confided.

Sally smiled slightly, &quot;Will you give us a cut of your
winnings?&quot;

&quot;Twenty for you, eighty for me?&quot; Duo proposed.

&quot;Hey, we&#39;d be staying in jail a extra week.. Fifty
fifty!&quot; Sally protested.

&quot;You&#39;re cutting into my profit,&quot; Duo complained.

Noin cleared her throat as Sally smiled, &quot;Sorry, Duo.&quot;

&quot;Just joking,&quot; he said then Duo became more serious.
&quot;We&#39;ll let you out on your word you won&#39;t try
anything,&quot; he said, &quot;but be aware we&#39;re keeping an eye
on you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d expect nothing less,&quot; Noin answered gravely.
Meeting his eyes she said, &quot;What&#39;s the situation? If
it involves taking down Catelonia, we want to help.&quot;
