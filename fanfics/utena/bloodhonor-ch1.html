<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Utena&#39;s robin egg&#39;s blue eyes suddenly snapped open as the final rays 
of sunlight faded from the room, giving way to the shadows of 
twilight. She lay there, deathly still, and slowly felt life and 
motion begin to return to her chill flesh and bones, the blood 
starting to pump ever so slowly through her veins. She took a shallow 
breath, then a full one, more out of a reflex than any real need for 
air.

&#39;It&#39;s time for me to go out and feed again,&#39; Utena thought to herself 
sadly.

Utena eased herself out of the musty, abandoned bed and quickly washed 
herself clean in a nearby basin of icy cold water. She then smoothly 
dawned her usual boy&#39;s school uniform with a feline, unearthly kind of 
grace that she still found a little disturbing. Her new, more powerful 
senses suddenly expanded outward, reaching across the room to the four 
corners of the building.

&#39;There&#39;s someone alive out there,&#39; she thought, the person&#39;s heart 
beating as loud as a drum to her new senses.

The sound of footsteps, a soft knocking on the door, and Utena knew 
who it was as she said softly, &quot;Please come in, Wakaba.&quot;

The younger girl opened the door and came in, before closing it 
quietly behind her. Utena could smell the sweet scent of her warm 
flesh, almost feel the blood that pumped in the girl&#39;s veins, and her 
fangs extended, suddenly aching to be used.

Wakaba shivered as she saw the hungry, almost feral look come over 
Utena&#39;s handsome face. Without intending to, she slowly walked closer 
to her, almost hypnotized by what she saw in those bright blue eyes. 
With violently shaking hands she rolled up her sleeve and extended her 
pale, pink arm, as she said to her huskily &quot;What ever you need, Utena. 
Please, take what you must.&quot;

Utena reluctantly grasped at that outstretched arm, then with what 
seemed like a superhuman effort she cried, &quot;No, Wakaba!&quot; and gently 
pushed her away. She continued on hoarsely &quot;I swore I wouldn&#39;t. Just 
watch this place, and I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;

Utena all but ran away from Wakaba, leapt out the upper window and 
then hit the ground below like a cat, sprinting into the forest that 
lay all around Ohtori. Wakaba watched her go, and hoped that Utena 
would be all right.

The deer paused in it&#39;s feeding, and raised it&#39;s head enquiringly, 
looking for whatever had disturbed it. The figure silently came out 
from the shadows and in a single forceful gesture, broke it&#39;s neck!

Utena roughly picked up the deer, then in a single motion buried her 
fangs in it&#39;s throat, letting her mouth fill with the animal&#39;s rich 
blood. She gulped it down, repelled by the taste but knowing she had 
to feed, or else she would truly die the final death. Finally sated, 
she picked up the bloodless corpse and then carried it to a nearby 
pathway. It was used by the local wolf pack, so the meat wouldn&#39;t go 
to waste.

She owed Wakaba so much, Utena knew. The young girl had come upon her, 
Utena only just changed to a vampire and nearly mad with her hunger, 
and she had bravely caught her a rat to feed from. Utena quickly 
learned how to feed herself, and while the animal&#39;s blood tasted awful 
to her new taste buds, she could at least live her new life ethically. 
&#39;Unlike some of the other residents of the vampire haunted academy of 
Ohtori,&#39; Utena thought to herself grimly.

With that thought foremost in her mind Utena made her way back to 
Ohtori, and a appointment she really must keep...

------------------------------------------------------------

Juri stretched as she awoke, feeling the warmth of her chosen 
companion laying on the queen sized bed beside her. Shiori smiled in 
her sleep, arcing her body so her neck and breasts were open and 
available to Juri&#39;s every whim. Juri kissed her, lightly, then slipped 
from the bed and padded nude out of the bedroom. Ruka silently met her 
at the door and handed her a clean and ironed school uniform.

&quot;You&#39;re not...?&quot; he asked, nodding to the sleeping Shiori.

Juri shrugged, &quot;Two nights in a row might be a little too much for 
her, it could put her life at risk. Ruka, make sure she eats well, 
spinach, liver, iron rich foods to restore the blood. I don&#39;t want her 
getting sick on me.&quot;

&quot;Of course, master,&quot; Ruka said, and bowed to her in a semi-mocking 
way.

Juri shot him an annoyed look as she snarled at him &quot;Do not call me 
that, Ruka.&quot; For just a moment, she wore her predator&#39;s face, a visage 
that often meant a painful death to those who saw it.

Ruka seemed distinctly unworried as he cheerfully protested &quot;Aw, but 
it spoils the whole vampire queen and servant riff we&#39;ve got going!&quot;

Juri shook her head and laughed softly at his mad antics. &quot;See you 
later,&quot; she said, and disappeared into the night.

Juri silently made her way across the rooftops to a nearby dorm, and 
then she gracefully crawled down the wall until she found the room she 
wanted to visit tonight. The girl living there had seen her feed on 
another of her dorm-mates earlier that week, but instead of running 
from Juri in fear, she had instead opened the top of her nightgown, 
revealing her pale throat and the tops of her pert breasts. Juri was 
full, so she had just smiled at her toothily and softly promised her 
&quot;Later.&quot;

The girl shifted in her bed, the cold night&#39;s breeze awakening her. 
Her blue eyes opened, and she gasped softly, &quot;Juri-sama!&quot;

Juri smiled at her, stepping closer, &quot;I told you I&#39;d be back.&quot; She 
smiled at her softly, &quot;Would you like me to lie with you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; the girl squeaked softly, and Juri smiled down at her 
fondly. She gently flipped the covers back and Juri got another very 
pleasant surprise: the girl now slept nude. Juri gently fondled and 
stroked the shapely breasts as she lay beside her, then she let one 
hand slowly and teasingly slide down the girl&#39;s exposed front.

&#39;I should give her pleasure first,&#39; Juri thought to herself wryly, &#39;to 
balance out the pain.&#39; Under Juri&#39;s very skilled fingers the girl 
writhed, then shuddered as the orgasms came tearing through her slim 
body one after the other! Just as she came, Juri brought her mouth to 
one breast and bit down with her fangs!

The girl came again and again as Juri fed, the pleasure and pain 
merging into one in her fevered mind. Juri felt the girl weaken and 
reluctantly released her. Juri didn&#39;t feed to kill, just enough for 
her own survival. She lapped the last traces of the blood away, unique 
saliva from her tongue sealing the wounds, and then she departed, 
leaving the girl to sleep the rest of the truly satisfied.

Juri stood out on the rooftop and smiled slightly to herself, waiting 
for a few moments. &quot;You can come out, now,&quot; Juri, tired of the cat and 
mouse games, said calmly to the figure standing concealed in the 
shadows.

&quot;You let them live so far,&quot; Utena said to Juri quietly as she moved 
silently from the concealing depths of the shadows. &quot;That&#39;s the only 
reason I&#39;ll let you live.&quot; With that, she disappeared once more into 
the darkness.

&quot;Killjoy,&quot; Juri said with a wry smile. &quot;She has got to learn to take 
herself less seriously,&quot; she said softly. Her expression darkened, she 
knew Utena wasn&#39;t someone to underestimate. She had already slain the 
vampire Lord Akio, after all...

------------------------------------------------------------

Touga held the struggling girl, laughing as she flailed away against 
his chest. He looked into her eyes, and her struggles slowly ebbed. He 
didn&#39;t take her will away, he liked seeing the terror in their eyes, 
the rapid pulse hammering like a drum.

&quot;Kozue,&quot; Touga smiled, &quot;don&#39;t you want to be with me? I remember a 
time when you would have fallen into my arms easily.&quot;

&quot;Please, no,&quot; Kozue whimpered weakly. &quot;I want to live,&quot; she said 
breathlessly.

&quot;But you will,&quot; Touga smiled, his fangs gleaming in the moonlight, 
&quot;get to live forever just like I will.&quot;

He heard the footsteps before the door opened, and wondered who was so 
utterly foolish as to think about trying to interfere. The door 
opened, he caught the scent, and began to laugh softly to himself. 
&quot;Come in, Miki,&quot; Touga invited him.

The blue-hared young man carried a cross in one hand and a stake in 
the other. &quot;Let her go, Touga,&quot; Miki half asked, half pled. His hands 
shook as Touga met his eye, smiling at him calmly. &#39;He knows I&#39;m no 
threat,&#39; Miki thought despairingly.

Then a female voice spoke from the shadows, &quot;He said, let her go.&quot; 
Before Touga could even react, Kozue was plucked from his grasp and 
flung aside. Utena took a moment to push her hair from her eyes before 
she fixed Miki with a look. &quot;Get her out of here,&quot; she commanded him 
calmly.

Touga looked at her in shock, &quot;What are you doing, Tenjou? They are 
our prey!&quot; He shook his head as if he didn&#39;t understand her at all.

&quot;They were our friends, once,&quot; Utena answered him calmly. She smiled a 
bit, &quot;But this isn&#39;t the time for debate.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Touga admitted, standing a bit straighter as he seemed to try 
and marshal his strength. He met Utena&#39;s gaze calmly, their wills 
battling invisibly for supremacy.

Utena smiled feraly, hefting a stake in her hand. &quot;Come on,&quot; she 
invited, &quot;lets see what you&#39;ve got.&quot; </pre>
