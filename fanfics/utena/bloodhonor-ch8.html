<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Wakaba and Anthy stood hesitantly in front of the burnt shell of the 
old science building. &quot;The fire did a lot of damage,&quot; Anthy noted as 
she looked up at the blackened exterior, &quot;is there even enough of the 
roof left to give a vampire shelter?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s always the basement,&quot; Wakaba said dryly. A bit more crossly, 
&quot;Besides, we&#39;ve checked almost every other abandoned building in 
Ohtori.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Anthy admitted. A bit more quietly she said, &quot;I guess 
I just don&#39;t like the feel of this, is all.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Wakaba looked in surprise at Anthy, &quot;you&#39;re a vampire hunter.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean I still don&#39;t get nervous,&quot; Anthy defended herself, 
&quot;or even a bit scared at times. It&#39;s just that you get used to it.&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way,&quot; Wakaba admitted, carefully pushing 
the door open. It didn&#39;t creak, which struck both of them as odd.

&quot;Someone&#39;s oiled the hinge,&quot; Anthy murmured. She pulled a stake from 
her clothing, her eyes narrowing as she looked around cautiously.

&quot;Let&#39;s look around,&quot; Wakaba suggested.

&quot;We really should wait until tonight,&quot; Anthy quickly answered, &quot;and 
then come back better prepared with Utena.&quot;

Wakaba didn&#39;t listen to her, venturing farther into the building. A 
door was on the other side of the room, and Wakaba tried the door 
knob. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s unlocked,&quot; she smiled.

Wakaba turned the knob and pulled even as Anthy cried, &quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;

Out of the pitch darkness of the other room a bone white hand struck 
out, grabbing Wakaba firmly by the throat. &quot;You.. shouldn&#39;t even be.. 
awake,&quot; a stunned Wakaba managed to get out as the hand began to cut 
off her air.

&quot;Not all vampires are the same,&quot; the woman&#39;s smooth voice said even as 
the hand that was extended into the sunlight began to smoke, the skin 
blistering. Wakaba stopped her struggling, going limp in the grip of 
unearthly strength.

&quot;Let her go,&quot; Anthy hissed, stake ready.

&quot;You&#39;re not strong enough, little hunter,&quot; the woman said, and Anthy 
could see other figures moving behind the first vampire. &quot;I know you,&quot; 
she said, &quot;you and Wakaba. You both serve Tenjou Utena, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Anthy would have said that she worked with Utena, but this wasn&#39;t the 
time to debate. &quot;Yes, and?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Bring her to me,&quot; the vampire woman said, drawing the unconscious 
Wakaba into the darkness, &quot;or her friend dies.&quot;

The door closed, leaving only silence.



Utena awoke as the sunset came, her eyes opening to a sight of beauty. 
The young women lay close around her, hands gently grasping her body. 
&quot;Good evening,&quot; she smiled, and they began to rouse themselves as 
well.

&quot;Do you need to feed, Utena-sama?&quot; a redhead asked her with a sweet 
smile.

&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Utena smiled back, &quot;I just did last night.&quot;

&quot;Darn,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;it&#39;s my turn next.&quot;

Utena laughed quietly. She pulled a uniform from her dresser and began 
to dress. She felt their hungry gazes upon her back and tried not to 
let her bother her. Still, it stirred her hungers, not the hunger for 
blood but for other pleasures.

She had never known the joy that another&#39;s smooth form could grant, 
teasing and taming the hunger in others until recently. Occasionally, 
she wondered how it might feel to receive such pleasures, but the 
feeding was enough for her.

At least, that was what she kept telling herself.

A hammering at the door jarred Utena from such thoughts, and she felt 
a tiny bit or relief. A step, and she opened the door, recognizing the 
heartbeat of the one who waited.

&#39;But why is it running so fast?&#39; Utena wondered.

Anthy&#39;s clothes were messy, her hair out of it&#39;s bun and curling down 
her shoulders. Wide eyed, she gasped, &quot;They&#39;ve got her.&quot;

Utena felt a chill seize her, realizing that someone hadn&#39;t been there 
to greet her when she awoke. &quot;Wakaba?&quot; Utena whispered.

Anthy saw the pain in her eyes and had to look away. &quot;Yes,&quot; she 
whispered.

&quot;How could you let this happen?&quot; Utena demanded angrily, grabbing 
Anthy by the shoulders and shaking her. Her fangs gleamed in the dim 
light, and the girl&#39;s began to gather around, disturbed by their 
mistress&#39; rage.

&quot;The vampire was awake during the day,&quot; Anthy answered, trying to stay 
as calm as possible. She drew the stake from her clothes, just in 
case.

Utena was clearly startled by that. &quot;But that isn&#39;t possible,&quot; she 
said quietly.

&quot;Possible or no, it happened,&quot; Anthy answered. More quietly, &quot;And she 
has other vampires in there with her, but I&#39;m not sure how many.&quot;

&quot;Was it Kanae?&quot; Utena asked quietly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know for certain,&quot; Anthy answered, &quot;but her arm was burned in 
the sunlight, and she didn&#39;t even flinch.&quot;

Utena closed her eyes, lost in her thoughts a moment. &quot;Stay here, I&#39;ll 
be back soon,&quot; she finally said quietly.

&quot;But, what about Wakaba? We have to go after her as soon as possible,&quot; 
Anthy protested.

&quot;Stay here!&quot; Utena barked, the command rolling across them all like a 
wave.



Wakaba groaned softly, her entire body aching. She unsteadily pushed 
herself up from the floor, the world spinning all around her. It was 
dark, blackness all around her, and she fought to try and remember how 
she had gotten there.

&quot;Good evening, little one,&quot; the emotionless voice said.

Wakaba felt her heart skip a beat as the memories began to slowly come 
back to her. &#39;I know that voice,&#39; she thought, turning her head to 
gaze at where the sound had come from.

The green haired woman sat comfortably, looking at her much the way a 
cat might watch an particularly interesting mouse. Her skin was 
bleached, as white as the finest parchment except for a red scar on 
her arm, and her eyes were pools of night.

Wakaba felt herself falling into those eyes, and had to look away.

&quot;Well done,&quot; Kanae said with a tiny bit of amusement in her voice, 
&quot;most people lack the wisdom to do that.&quot;

She got up to stand at Wakaba&#39;s side, pulling her to her feet in a 
single smooth motion. &quot;Oww!&quot; Wakaba yelped as Kanae tugged too hard.

&quot;Did that hurt?&quot; Kanae asked. There was no real feeling in the 
question, no concern. It was like she was simply asking about the 
weather, if it would be sunny or not.

Kanae let her go, and Wakaba barely managed to stay on her feet. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she hissed, rubbing at her sore shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the stone faced Kanae said. &quot;I&#39;m not interested in 
hurting you,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;that isn&#39;t the reason I&#39;m doing this 
at all.&quot;

Behind her, Wakaba could make out shapes moving, and she realized 
there were vampires lining the walls. Wakaba looked at Kanae, her eyes 
wide. &quot;But why...?&quot;

&quot;Do you know what it&#39;s like, to be a vampire?&quot; Kanae asked her. &quot;We 
awaken each night, and the first thought is blood. I rest, and all I 
see is the faces of those that I have killed to survive. And my 
Akio-sama...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Wakaba said softly. &quot;Uhg,&quot; choked, a hand clamping on her 
throat.

&quot;All you are is a bag of hot blood to me,&quot; a suddenly feral Kanae 
hissed at her, &quot;so do not speak. Your life depends on it.&quot;

Wakaba nodded, silently, and Kanae let her go. Wakaba fell backwards 
on her butt, and forcibly silenced her cry of pain, biting down on her 
lower lip.

&quot;Akio-sama was made for me, made to be my eternal companion, but he is 
gone,&quot; Kanae said softly. &quot;I don&#39;t want to go on, but the vampire part 
of me is too strong. It wants to live, whatever the cost,&quot; she 
murmured.

Kanae closed her eyes a moment, then opened them wide. &quot;None of the 
ones Akio created were strong enough, all of them fell under my will,&quot; 
she said softly. &quot;Please, let Utena be strong enough to resist, to 
free me from this curse,&quot; much more softly, so Wakaba could barely 
hear, &quot;free me from my Mother&#39;s curse.&quot;



Juri felt the disturbance she made, more than she sensed her. &#39;Utena 
is really getting quite good at this,&#39; she though, even as she said, 
&quot;Good evening, Utena.&quot;

The wind blew across the roof they were standing on, the crescent moon 
rising slowly above them. &quot;I need your help,&quot; Utena said simply.

&quot;Help with what, I wonder?&quot; Juri asked teasingly, only to be cut off 
by a soft snarl.

&quot;Don&#39;t play games with me, not now,&quot; Utena said intensely. &quot;That crazy 
bitch has my best friend,&quot; she finished.

&quot;Wakaba?&quot; Juri asked, and Utena nodded.

&quot;She has other vampires serving her,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;and I&#39;m 
going to need more than just Anthy&#39;s help to stop her.&quot;

Juri looked away from Utena, softly answering, &quot;It&#39;s not my fight.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make you a deal,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;I&#39;ll give you what you 
want, an equal.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Juri looked up, an intrigued expression on her face.

&quot;I will transform Shiori into a vampire,&quot; Utena said quietly, &quot;that 
way she&#39;ll be resistant to your control, free to love you if she so 
wishes.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;ll be under your control,&quot; Juri frowned.

Utena met Juri&#39;s eyes, &quot;If I change her, I&#39;ll leave Ohtori soon 
afterward.&quot; She looked away sadly, &quot;I can&#39;t stay here, a barely tame 
killer.&quot;

Juri met her eyes silently, weighing the truth of her words. Finally, 
she nodded, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll help you against Kanae.&quot;

They slid across the rooftops to Utena&#39;s dorm room, seeing Anthy 
pacing the small room like some caged lioness. She looked up to see 
Juri follow Utena in, exclaiming, &quot;You?&quot; Anthy glared at Utena, &quot;What 
is she doing here?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s here to help,&quot; Utena answered.

Juri smiled as she looked at Anthy. To Utena, &quot;She&#39;s quite attractive. 
Another member of your loyal harem, maybe?&quot;

&quot;Loyal, yes,&quot; Anthy answered her coldly, &quot;but not one of her harem.&quot; 
She looked over at Utena, &quot;Do we really need her?&quot;

Utena looked like she had a headache, &quot;Yes.&quot; Crossly, she added, 
&quot;Let&#39;s go, please, before it&#39;s too late to try and save Wakaba.&quot;

Juri nodded, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; She looked over at Anthy, &quot;Truce?&quot;

Anthy still didn&#39;t look terribly pleased, but she managed to say, &quot;A 
truce, for Utena&#39;s sake.&quot; </pre>
