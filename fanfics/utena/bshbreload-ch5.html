<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 5 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bshbreload-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>With the setting of the sun the creatures of the night
began to stir from their daytime rest. Owls hooted
mournfully, bats took wing, rats scurried, wolves
howled out their lonely cries, and in and around
Ohtori Academy, the vampires awakened in their dens.

Touga Kiryuu sighed softly to himself, the red haired
young man holding out his goblet to one of his pretty
little serving girls. There were dozens of them, all
sweet young things he had brought here by the force of
his will alone. Deprived of any clothes they sauntered
about the observatory or lounged on the couches, ready
and willing to serve his every need.

&quot;Fill it up,&quot; Touga ordered her softly.

Breasts bouncing the nude girl paced towards where
Touga was sitting, holding out her arm over the rim of
the glass. With grace she took a barber&#39;s razor and
gently drew it over one of several barely healed
scars. Redness welled up, and then flowed into the
glass as she moaned softly. One of the other girls
slipped up behind her, a arm curling arount to cup a
full breast even as another slid down between her legs
seeking sweet wetness.

Touga watched the glass fill even as she began to sway
in place, moaning as the other girl pleasured her.
Keeping her arm still was a challenge as the little
redhead licked her neck, biting occassionally as her
hands sped up. A hard nipple was firmly pinched, the
soft flesh of the breast pulled and released as the
wicked redhead worked to bring her companion to
orgasm.

&quot;Ah!&quot; In a cry as much pain as pleasure she came,
thighs glossy with her heady wine even as the blood
rushed, filling the cup. She grew pale, and as a last
few drops of her precious blood fell, she collapsed
limply backwards. He took a small drink from his
glass, swirling the liquid around in his mouth,
savoring the sweet taste and the heady smell in the
air while ignoring the body that was now laying on the
floor nearby.

Finally, Touga pretended to notice her and casually
said to the other girls, &quot;If she&#39;s still alive,
bandage up her arm and let her rest.&quot; With a cold
smile he added, &quot;If she&#39;s dead, toss her out with the
rest of the trash.&quot; A few of the serving girls quickly
dragged her body away, leaving a small streak of blood
on the floor in their wake.

The mad vampire, Saionji, scrambled out from his
corner, lapping at the mess on the clean floor, the
ragged remnants of his uniform shirt his only
covering. Touga reached out to pat his filthy mop of
hair as he laughingly said, &quot;Good doggie.&quot; Saionji
whined out his happiness, looking up at his master
with an odd adoration in his eyes as he suddenly began
to develop an erection. He nuzzled at Touga&#39;s lap but
he firmly pushed him away as he commanded, &quot;No bone
for you tonight, boy, go play with one of the girls.&quot;

&quot;Awrrr... Touga...,&quot; Saionji managed to growl, eyes
gleaming with insanity then he turned. He was off like
a shot, the redhead who had worked so hard to pleasure
her companion his target. She didn&#39;t even have a
chance to cry out as he leapt, yellowed fangs ripping
her throat out even as he brutally mounted her,
humping away madly.

&quot;Good puppy,&quot; Touga laughed aloud. But that momentary
feeling of pleasure quickly faded, and Touga was left
only with his own troubling thoughts.

`It was far too easy,&#39; Touga thought to himself
grimly, `to dominate these cattle. I need to find a
new challenge.&#39; He smiled slightly, thinking of Tenjou
Utena. `She&#39;s beautiful, so fierce, and her will is as
strong as any I have met. No wonder Lord Akio wanted
her! If I could take her,&#39; he mused, `it would be
truly glorious.&#39;

&quot;Will you try to take Utena, then?&quot; the smooth voice
asked him from the shadows, almost as if it&#39;s owner
had been able to read his very thoughts. Touga turned
around in his seat in surprise at the intrusion,
frowning to see the woman that some called the
beautiful leopard, Arisugawa Juri, standing there
right behind him.

&quot;I haven&#39;t decided,&quot; Touga lied to her smoothly,
wondering how she had snuck in.

Juri smiled slightly, her long orange hair flowing
like a wave over the crisp uniform she wore as she
said mockingly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying it,
Kiryuu.&quot; She smiled, or at least bared her white teeth
with a hint of her fangs showing as she purred
dangerously, &quot;I think she&#39;d be too much for you to
handle, little boy.&quot;

Touga hissed in sudden fury at her gall, his own fangs
gleaming in the dim lights, but she just laughed as
she turned to casually walked away. Saionji moved to
try and stop her but she swiiftly kicked him aside
like the dog he now was. He ran to a corner with a
painful yelp, cowering in fear as she descended the
stairs.

Juri strode away from the tower, deep in thought.
`Hopefully, he&#39;ll try to attack Utena,&#39; she thought
with a grim little smile, `She&#39;ll kill him easily, of
course, and my primary rival for the ladies of Ohtori
will be gone.&#39;

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; ;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Nanami pressed herself up against the wall, trying
desperately to get away from him. &quot;Please,&quot; the
beautiful blonde cried out, &quot;you don&#39;t want to do
this!&quot;

Tsuwabuki just smiled at her, his white fangs gleaming
in the lamp light. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of you, Nanami,&quot;
the brown haired boy sighed out to her dreamily, &quot;just
like your brother. I&#39;ll keep you safe.&quot; He took
another half step forward, his eyes gleaming madly as
the horrid scent of rotting meat wafted from his body.

Tsuwabuki&#39;s black school uniform was shabby now, badly
torn, far different than how he had once looked. But
what he was now had very little in common with what he
had once been, the handsome young boy with the bright
future ahead completely gone.

&quot;No,&quot; Nanami softly whimpered, almost trying to go
through the wall itself to attempt to get away from
the young vampire.

There was a startled look on his face and Nanami cried
out, surprise and horror in her voice as something wet
burst out of his chest, spraying her with foul
smelling gore. She looked in shock as the woman
smoothly drove Tsuwabiki&#39;s body downward, looking like
some kind of warrior goddess as she struck with what
looked like a spear of some kind.

&quot;Stay still, damn you,&quot; Utena muttered to him.

She paused in her work to look up at Nanami, Utena&#39;s
eyes the most shocking color of blue. She used the
flagpole that she had stabbed him with to pin the
small boy&#39;s writhing body down to the floor. Then she
knelt down, staked the creature&#39;s heart and he
suddenly stopped struggling.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nanami managed to say as she fought the
urge to gag, feeling her legs growing weak underneath
her in relief.

Utena looked up, seeing the shell shocked look on the
young girl&#39;s face. It was something she had grown used
to seeing, here at Ohtori. &quot;Are you going to be all
right?&quot; Utena asked her crisply, carefully keeping her
distance from the girl.

Nanami spat several times, trying to get something out
of her mouth. &quot;He used to be a nice kid,&quot; she said
softly, a tear trickling down as she looked at the
boy&#39;s body.

Utena noticed that some of the gore covering Nanami
had gotten into her mouth, too. &quot;Better wash out your
mouth when you shower,&quot; she advised her, easily
picking up Tsuwabuki and putting him over her
shoulder. `I don&#39;t know if you can become a vampire
accidentally swallowing the blood,&#39; she thought, `and
I don&#39;t think I want to find out.&#39; Before Nanami could
say anything in reply Utena was gone, disappearing
into the darkness without a sound.

Nanami leaned up against the wall, trying to summon
the strength to move as her thoughts raced. &#39;That&#39;s
the missing student,&#39; she realized, &#39;Tenjou Utena. Why
did she...?&#39;

&quot;She didn&#39;t hurt you, did she?&quot; the dusky skinned
woman emerged from the shadows, looking towards where
Utena had disappeared.

&quot;Who?&quot; Nanami blurted, turning to look at the strange
girl in surprise. She was dressed in a long skirt,
rustling as she moved, and her hair was the boldest
shade of purple.

&quot;Himemiya Anthy,&quot; she quietly introduced herself,
gently suporting Nanami as she helped her walk away.

&#39;Looks like having Anthy around will be useful,&#39; Utena
thought as she carried the body away. &#39;Still doesn&#39;t
trust me, though,&#39; she noted wryly.

It didn&#39;t take Utena very much time to gather up the
firewood she needed. She did it with as much dignity
as she could manage, giving poor Tsuwabuki a silent
prayer before she set his earthly remains ablaze. She
watched the flames dancing, the body slowly becoming
ashes and dust, lost in her own troubling thoughts.

&quot;Poor child,&quot; Utena heard a woman say from just a
little ways behind her, &quot;I don&#39;t think he was ever
suited to this life.&quot;

Utena quickly turned around to see Juri standing
there, looking into the fire thoughtfully. The rising
flames lit up her orange hair, and seemed to give the
color of life back to her bone pale skin. She looked
eerily beautiful standing there in the firelight and
Utena felt a sudden stab of something that could
almost be called... desire.

Juri tilted her head to the side as she continued,
&quot;Though none of us chose this, I suppose.&quot;

Utena toyed with the stake that she held in her hand
as she watched Juri warily. &quot;Something I can do for
you, Juri?&quot; she asked her softly, ready for any attack
that she might bring.

&quot;I&#39;d like to help you, Utena,&quot; Juri said to her
pleasantly. She took a careful step towards her,
smiling, and a strange scent seemed to waft over
towards her, a sweetness in the air that made Utena&#39;s
teeth ache to be used.

&quot;How can you help me?&quot; Utena asked, trying hard to
concentrate. That scent, it was so familiar, she
should know it!

&quot;You need to accept who you are,&quot; Juri answered her
softly, reaching out to stroke at Utena&#39;s cheek.
Utena&#39;s eyes widened as she saw a streak of dark red
along Juri&#39;s wrist, a stain that was slowly spreading
up her pale arm.

Suddenly she remembered exactly where she had smelled
that delicious scent before, from when she had fed
from Akio the very first time. The sweet scent of a
vampire&#39;s lifeblood, being freely given up to another.
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she made herself ask Juri
softly, her swiftly extended fangs making speech
difficult.

&quot;A sharing,&quot; Juri said, stepping up to Utena&#39;s body to
whisper softly, her sweet breath tickling her ear. She
felt Juri&#39;s cool body pressed up against her own, the
scent nearly overwhelming her. The hunger in her body
blazed with a sudden fire as Juri said, &quot;Will you take
my blood, Utena, so that I may take some of yours?&quot;

Drawing on all of her strength Utena turned and fled
but Juri followed her closely, the two racing over the
roofs back to the abandoned dorm, and to Utena&#39;s
silent bedroom. Utena hid in the shadows while Juri
stood at the doorway smiling at her, as a shaking
Utena fought the hunger that surged through her. A
hunger for what Juri offered her.

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Utena cried out, knowing that Juri
could not come into the room unless Utena herself
chose to invite her in.

Juri smiled sadly, dramatically shaking her head back
and forth. &quot;Oh, how you deny yourself, Tenjou,&quot; she
whispered, the softness of her voice making Utena
listen to it all the harder, &quot;We are both so alone,
you and I.&quot; She smiled as a single red tear slowly
trickled down her face and firing Utena&#39;s hunger even
more. &quot;Couldn&#39;t we be together, if only for tonight?
To not be so very alone, anymore?&quot; she asked with
surprising seriousness.

Juri extended her pale hand, a bit of her rich blood
pooling there in her palm, the scent making Utena&#39;s
head spin. Utena struggled with her hunger, with her
desire, but she knew it was a loosing battle. `It
doesn&#39;t have to mean anything,&#39; Utena thought to
herself desperately even as she said to Juri aloud,
&quot;Come inside.&quot;

Juri was inside and upon Utena in only a moment,
swiftly pressing the pooled blood to the other girl&#39;s
lips, then kissing her fiercely on the red stained
mouth. The blood that they passed back and forth
between them just seemed to make the fevered kisses
all the sweeter as Juri ground her body up against
Utena&#39;s, tongue&#39;s dancing.

Her hands tore at Utena&#39;s clothes, the black boy&#39;s
coat tossed aside even as her pants soon followed.
Naked beneath them Utena felt Juri&#39;s gaze run across
her body then Juri nearly moaned out, &quot;You look more
lovely than I thought...&quot;

Utena mewled as she felt the cut wrist pushed to her
own lips, even as Juri drew Utena&#39;s wrist up to the
wet heat of her own mouth. The taste of Juri was
indescribable, sweet wine one moment, brandy maybe,
then it simply dissolved into a mix of pure pleasure.
They fell as one to Utena&#39;s bed, their bodies tangling
together on top of the covers.

`Now,&#39; Juri thought triumphantly, `now you&#39;re mine at
last, my sweet Utena.&#39; She pulled away from the cut,
her lips bright red and simply tore her own uniform
away, casting the clothing aside as she looked down at
Utena with an expression of raw hunger.

&quot;Please,&quot; Utena moaned out, all of her strength having
fled as she lay there at Juri&#39;s mercy, heat racing
through her thin form.

Juri slid over Utena&#39;s body, sliding one long leg
between her&#39;s as she pressed down. Utena spread her
leg&#39;s wantonly, Juri&#39;s thigh pressing forcefully to
her wet pussy. &quot;You&#39;re more beautiful now,&quot; Juri
purred, &quot;with your desire written on youir face.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Utena hissed out as she pulled Juri down
into another fierce kiss, both of them moving together
roughly on the creaking bed, eagerly seeking the
hights of pleasure that their bodies could reach. As
the first orgasm crashed through Utena a single
thought came home to her, &#39;Nothing will ever be the
same for me after this.&#39;

Early in the morning, Utena stood alone by her window,
looking out into the darkness that still lingered here
before the coming of the dawn. The naked young woman
looked down at her wrist, the now fully healed wound a
soft pink, and licked at her lips. A little bit of the
sweetness she had tasted still lingered there, to
tease at her memory.

She walked over to her bed, looking down at the pale
red stained sheets before violently tearing the bloody
cloth right off the mattress. She concentrated on what
she was doing, trying not to let herself think about
what she had done tonight or the scent that wafted up,
a heady mix of sex and blood. `Or how much I enjoyed
what we did,&#39; Utena admitted to herself with a soft
sigh.

What Juri had said to her when she was leaving still
lingered in Utena&#39;s mind. Standing there in her
uniform, the coat unbuttoned and the swell of her
breasts clearly visable she had looked even more
desireable, if that was possible. &quot;When you&#39;re ready
to accept what you are,&quot; Juri had said to her with a
little smile, &quot;come to me.&quot; A smile stretched Juri&#39;s
blood red lips as she seductively vowed to her, &quot;I&#39;ll
show you pleasures that would make tonight seem like
nothing.&quot;

Utena could feel the heaviness coming over her limbs,
a cue that dawn was going to be here soon. She closed
up the shutters, laying down on the bare bed for her
day&#39;s rest. As she eyes closed, strangely, she found
herself thinking about Anthy, too.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; ;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

It was only an hour after dawn when it was found,
sprawled out in one of the gardens. The girl&#39;s nude
body was pale, drained of it&#39;s blood, and wounds made
by a blade marked her arms. Most were long healed, but
one still oozed a bit of pink.

Anthy moved through the crowd carefully, her new
schoolgirl&#39;s uniform swirling around her legs. She
reached the clear space and knelt down, examining the
body. The vampire hadn&#39;t chosen to bite, making his
servant bleed herself for him, preventing the further
spread of the vampire curse. There was a smile on the
dead girl&#39;s face, as if she had been happy to give of
herself.

&#39;What sort of person does this?&#39; ahe wondered. A piece
of paper lay nearby, the edge slightly stained by the
little blood that had remained in her body. Anthy
picked it up to read and a muscle in her jaw jumped in
anger.

&quot;Tenjou Utena,&quot; it read in elegant script, &quot;Stop me if
you can.&quot; And underneath, it was signed simply &quot;Kiryuu
Touga.&quot;

Anthy crushed the paper in her hand, her hair blowing
in the breeze. &#39;Should I handle this myself.&#39; she
wondered, &#39;or would this make a good test for Utena?&#39;
She turned to walk away, frowning as she recognized a
familiar face in the crowd, &#39;And what is Nanami doing here?&#39;</pre>
