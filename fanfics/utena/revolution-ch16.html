<a href="../utena/revolution-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>It was an odd moment at the colony&#39;s shuttlebay as
they made their farewells, the diplomatic maneuvers
continuing on right up to the final moments. &quot;He never
gives up, does he?&quot; Hilde murmured, her short hair
ruffled by the artificial breeze.

&quot;Father is quite stubborn that way,&quot; Releena agreed,
her long brown hair flowing away from her face. She
smiled wryly at Hilde as she gently said, &quot;I wanted to
say thank you for all of your help, even if the others
forget.&quot;

Hilde shrugged slightly, &quot;Just doing my job, sorta.&quot;
She studied Releena a moment before dropping her
voice, &quot;Have you decided what you&#39;re going to do?&quot;

Releena felt her fingers go to the rose signet she now
wore on a chain around her neck. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she
admitted, &quot;whatever seems necessary at the time.&quot;

&quot;Good enough,&quot; Hilde smiled slightly. She looked over
to where Juri and Une stood stiffly, staring at each
other with deadly intensity. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t have any
trouble with them on the way home,&quot; she said wryly.

Releena rolled her eyes as she sighed out, &quot;I just
pray that they have seats on opposite sides of the
shuttle home.&quot;

Juri&#39;s orange hair flowed free, the curls flowing
around her face as she studied the military officer in
front of her. &quot;Are you going to keep our agreement?&quot;
she asked softly, all of them waiting uncomfortably
for the signal to board.

Colonel Une nodded jerkily, her glasses gleaming and
her hair pulled back in a ruthless bun. &quot;Releena will
be protected, Arisugawa,&quot; Une pushed up her glasses
with a white gloved hand as she agreed irritably,
&quot;though I promise nothing in regards to you.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting anything else,&quot; Juri answered her
mildly. She paused a second, &quot;When you&#39;re ready to
face me again, I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;

Une met her eyes, her glasses glinting in the
reflected light. &quot;I&#39;ll be looking forward to that,&quot;
and there was a odd gentleness in Une&#39;s voice.

Juri watched Une walk up the boarding ramp before
shaking her head slightly, wondering where that came
from. From just behind her a grim voice said, &quot;I hope
you&#39;ll be ready to take responsibility for what you&#39;ve
done.&quot;

Turning Juri saw the Ambassador standing there, his
suit as crisp as when they first came there. &quot;How so?&quot;
Juri asked mildly.

Dornlan frowned down at her as he said accusingly,
&quot;The colonies seem far closer to adopting a military
posture than ever before.&quot;

&quot;If the words of one young woman can sway the leaders
of the colonies that easily,&quot; eyes flashing Juri shot
back in a rare display of anger, &quot;then they must have
been damn near to making that choice anyway.&quot; She
paused before a final cut, &quot;Especially considering the
actions that your own government has taken with them.&quot;

The older man sighed, seemingly unable to reply to
that statement. &quot;The only chance we have for peace is
for both sides to talk,&quot; Dornlan said tiredly, &quot;and
the way things are going we&#39;ll not be talking any time
soon.&quot;

Walking in a loose group Juri, Releena ad her father
went into the shuttle, taking seats in one side while
Une and her assistants took another. The baggage was
stowed away and with a surprising degree of gentleness
the shuttle was launched from the colony.

&quot;But maybe,&quot; Releena offered softly, &quot;the time for
talking is over?&quot;

&quot;You too?&quot; her father smiled wryly.

Releena shrugged gracefully, her eyes gentle as she
looked up at her father, &quot;Daddy, I know you believe in
what you&#39;re saying... but the world may not be ready
for peace.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never believe that,&quot; Dornlan said honestly.

Juri bit back the first reply that came to mind,
choosing something a bit more tactful. &quot;I honestly
hope you&#39;re right,&quot; she said calmly, &quot;but I don&#39;t
think so.&quot;

After a while the ambassador moved off, choosing to
set a seat back and try to rest up as they headed back
towards the Earth. &quot;What would you do,&quot; Releena asked
softly, &quot;if you found out something... disturbing
about yourself?&quot;

Juri blinked in surprise, looking at Releena and
wondering where that question had come from. &quot;It
happened to me once,&quot; Juri said, remembering how
frightening her early attraction to Shiori had been,
&quot;I learned to accept it, eventually.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so sure how easy this is going to be to
accept,&quot; Releena murmured. She looked up at Juri, her
expression oddly lost, &quot;Someone has claimed I might be
adopted.&quot;

Without thinking about it Juri let a hand rest on the
other girl&#39;s arm. &quot;Do you believe him or her?&quot; she
asked gently.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t believe it,&quot; Releena said, &quot;I don&#39;t
really know anything about him.&quot;

&quot;But it bothers you?&quot; Juri asked quietly.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Releena nodded reluctantly. &quot;It&#39;s not that my
parents have ever treated me with anything but love,&quot;
she explained, &quot;but I&#39;ve always felt slightly...
apart, somehow.&quot;

&quot;Being adopted wouldn&#39;t necessarily do that to you,&quot;
Juri mused, &quot;I felt apart in my home and I knew we
were related by blood.&quot;

Releena smiled faintly, &quot;A good point.&quot;

Juri studied Releena, trying to read the thoughts
behind that attractive face. &quot;Do you want to try
asking your parents?&quot;

&quot;God no,&quot; Releena visibly shuddered. &quot;I don&#39;t know
what would scare me more, their answering no... or
yes,&quot; she sighed.

Seeing the girl&#39;s distress Juri hesitantly slid an arm
across her shoulders, drawing her close. &quot;Whatever you
need to do,&quot; she found herself saying, &quot;I&#39;ll be here
to help.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena sighed, laying her head on Juri&#39;s
shoulder.

Colonel Une watched from across the aisle, observing
the two women sitting together. &#39;I can&#39;t believe that
they&#39;re doing such a thing inn public,&#39; was the first
thought, then she almost had to laugh at herself.
&#39;There&#39;s only us on the plane, after all.&#39;

A soft chirping sound brought her attention to her
waiting laptop and she opened up her military email
program, reviewing her newest files. Treise had sent
her a short missive, saying that he was looking
forward to her coming home. There were also updates on
several projects she was involved with, one of which
caught her eye.

Clicking on a message titled &#39;Tallgeese&#39; Une smiled
slightly, running through the update that Sally Po had
sent her. &quot;We&#39;ve prepared a modified Tallgeese as per
your instructions,&quot; Sally wrote, &quot;in your personal
colors. We&#39;ll need you there for the debut in a few
weeks.&quot;

Une quickly composed a reply, &quot;I&#39;m returning to Earth
now, Sally. The diplomatic mission has been a bust,
but on the plus side there&#39;s more ammunition for the
public relations corps.&quot; In a chatty, friendly tone
that would have surprised those that knew her she
summarized the public aspects of the mission even as
she considered what was coming.

Une, Noin, Zechs and Dorothy were so far the pilots in
the Tallgeese corps, intended to serve as a public
counter to the Gundams that were attacking OZ.
Personally she had doubts about the antiquated
technology, but both Treise and Zechs supported it.

&#39;Which means I had best go along,&#39; Une thought.

The difficulty was not going to be finding a fifth
qualified pilot but instead choosing from the many Oz
pilots that could do the job. More importantly the
pilot would have to be able to work with the wing,
coordinate smoothly in attack and defense.

&#39;Noin has taken Sally on as her wingman,&#39; Une thought
of an earlier message Sally had sent to her, &quot;I wonder
if our good doctor would be interested in piloting a
Tallgeese as well?&#39;

More importantly Une tried to keep any speculation as
to anything else Sally and Noin might be doing out of
her racing thoughts. The hero worship in Sally&#39;s last
letter had been almost unmistakable, and the frank
adoration that the normally controlled doctor had
shown towards Noin was nearly sickening to Une.

Looking up Une saw Releena and Juri still sitting so
closely together and had to look away. &#39;Why does this
bother me?&#39; she wondered.</pre>
