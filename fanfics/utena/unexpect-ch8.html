<h1>The Most Unexpected Thing (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/unexpect-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        &quot;Is it just me,&quot; Saionji asked Touga softly, nodding towards 
where Juri was stretching, &quot;or does Juri have a particularly murderous 
look on her face?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not just you,&quot; Touga took a look and agreed, his own 
red-brown hair falling down his back in a smooth wave. &quot;Have you done 
anything to annoy her recently?&quot; he asked curiously.

        &quot;Not that I know of,&quot; Saionji turned away from Juri&#39;s glare 
uncomfortably.

        Touga looked thoughtful, &quot;I understand that Juri has recently 
become friends with Wakaba, however. Didn&#39;t you treat her rather badly?&quot;

        Saionji&#39;s eyes widened slightly as he remembered. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; he 
finally murmured softly. He looked back at the still glaring Juri, &quot;I 
wonder if I could just surrender?&quot;

        &quot;We did give our word to Shiori we&#39;d fight Juri,&quot; Touga reminded 
him with a slight smile. He patted his friend on the shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, she won&#39;t do anything too lethal.&quot; He paused before quietly 
adding, &quot;I hope.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re so comforting,&quot; Saionji said dryly.

        Over in the spectator seats there was a great deal of whispered 
conversation going on among the guests. &quot;Saionji almost looks worried,&quot; 
Nanami noted, watching her elder brother Touga and Saionji readying for 
their bouts with Juri. The blonde shook her head with a smile, &quot;I wonder 
if Saionji&#39;s figured out what he&#39;s getting into?&quot;

        &quot;I almost feel sorry for him,&quot; Shiori admitted. Her purple hair 
curled against her neck, brushing up against the top of her girl&#39;s 
uniform. &quot;I wonder if I should just release both of them from their 
promises?&quot; she mused, moving to get up.

        Nanami put her hand on Shiori&#39;s arm, &quot;No, you don&#39;t need to.&quot; 
She was a bit surprised at the softness of the girl&#39;s arm, Shiori&#39;s 
delicate scent washing over her. She let go quickly, almost as if she 
had been burned.

        &quot;Why not?&quot; Shiori asked curiously as she sat back down. 
Surprisingly her arm almost felt cold, without that gentle touch resting 
there.

        Nanami had a faint blush on her cheeks as she looked out at the 
waiting fighters, &quot;Both of them could use to be taken down a peg, you 
know.&quot; She looked over at the beaming Wakaba and softly added, &quot;Even if 
Juri looses, I doubt the two of them would care.&quot;

        Shiori looked at Wakaba, and was just a bit surprised not to 
feel a stab of jealousy. Looking back out at Juri she searched for the 
anger she had felt, the vengefulness, but there seemed to be nothing 
left there. &quot;You could be right,&quot; Shiori smiled slightly at Nanami.

        Juri stood slightly apart from the others, readying her sword 
arm while Miki looked on. &quot;Are you ready, sempai?&quot; the blue haired young 
man asked.

        &quot;Always,&quot; Juri answered coolly, her long orange hair flowing 
over her shoulders. She raised her sword, the weapon shining in the dim 
light, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for this.&quot;

        &quot;Make sure you don&#39;t lose your perspective,&quot; Miki cautioned her, 
&quot;win the match, don&#39;t go too overboard getting Saionji.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Juri gave him a gentle smile.

        Juri walked to her place, waiting for Anthy. She stood there, 
holding the two roses dressed in her usual school girl&#39;s uniform. An 
fresh orange rose was put into Juri&#39;s pocket as the girl smiled up at 
her slightly, &quot;Good luck with your next match.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri said, looking over at her opponent.

        Anthy gracefully walked over to Saionji, placing a green rose in 
his own pocket. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Saionji said, studying Anthy with a 
searching gaze.

        Together they walked over to the squared off dueling arena, a 
large open space for them to move in. Saionji looked good dressed in his 
duelist uniform, almost shining with confidence, but there was worry in 
his eyes.

        &quot;Fighters, take your positions,&quot; the referee called out. Juri 
and Saionji each took their place, their eyes meeting like a invisible 
clash of swords. &quot;Ready,&quot; the referee paused for a moment before loudly 
declaring, &quot;fight!&quot;

        Saionji was moving as soon as the referee called, but Juri took 
a different tact. She stood there calmly, waiting for his rush. He 
reached her, Juri turned his sword aside even as she moved gracefully to 
the side.

        He skidded to a stop, Saionji raised his blade and ran at her 
once again. Juri watched his coming, still as a pool of water, moving 
the minimal amount to turn him aside. But this time her blade flicked 
out, cutting a decorative piece right off of his uniform.

        Juri had a Mona Lisa smile on her face, her expression 
unreadable as she raised her blade to the guard position once again. The 
windows to the gum were open, a faint breeze stirring Juri&#39;s long hair 
to flow around her.

        &quot;What is she doing?&quot; Wakaba squeaked out nervously as she 
watched Saionji charge at the challenging Juri once again.

        &quot;Wearing him down,&quot; Utena said, the pink haired duelist leaning 
forward as she watched the battle eagerly. &quot;Saionji is tiring himself 
out, while Juri&#39;s saving her strength,&quot; she explained, &quot;and when she 
decides the time is right, she&#39;ll strike.&quot;

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought Juri was capable of such deviousness,&quot; 
Nanami noted, &quot;I underestimated her, I think.&quot;

        &quot;Never underestimate Juri,&quot; Shiori smiled slightly, watching the 
battle with honest pleasure, &quot;I leaned that the hard way.&quot;

        Nanami gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;Is that why you were trying 
to recruit me to fight, because you knew she was capable of this?&quot;

        Shiori smiled back at the blonde, &quot;You&#39;re dangerous in your own 
way, Miss Kiryuu. I thought you could at least make this an interesting 
fight.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Nanami actually blushed a bit as she turned back to 
the fight.

        Saionji panted as he raised his katana again, his eyes narrowed 
in anger. Juri met his gaze calmly, just a hint of a smile teasing her 
lips. &quot;You made a fool of Wakaba in public,&quot; Juri said softly, &quot;do you 
remember?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Saionji scowled, meeting her gaze defiantly.

        &quot;Well, this little run around the ring you just did is my 
payback,&quot; Juri said. Her blade came up as she smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s finish 
this.&quot;

        Saionji barely managed to get his sword in place to block her 
attack, literally skidding backwards as she drove forward. Juri&#39;s sword 
flashed as she attacked smoothly, driving the blade upwards and striking 
across the exhausted man&#39;s chest.

        Rose petals fluttered to the ring floor as Saionji dropped to 
his knees. His sword suddenly to heavy he leaned forward, sighing. &quot;I 
knew I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed this morning,&quot; Saionji groaned 
before simply collapsing.

        &quot;Arisugawa wins!&quot; the referee declared again, a broad smile on 
his face.

        &quot;Juri!&quot; Wakaba hit her with a flying hug. &quot;Juri! Juri! Juri! 
Juri!&quot; she nearly choked Juri before finally letting her go. &quot;That was 
incredible!&quot;

        Touga helped Saionji up, &quot;You all right?&quot;

        &quot;Kill me now,&quot; Saionji groaned.

        &quot;Well, not today,&quot; Touga looked over at Juri, the taller woman 
hugging the smaller girl close. &quot;I didn&#39;t think Juri had that in her,&quot; 
he added.

        &quot;Trust me, she does,&quot; Saionji sighed. He watched the two of them 
together before adding, &quot;That&#39;s so cute it&#39;s almost sickening.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s get you some rest,&quot; Touga helped haul the other boy over 
to the benches at the side. &quot;Thanks for taking her on first,&quot; he said, 
&quot;it may help me face her later.&quot;

        Saionji wiped the sweat from his brow, &quot;At least she&#39;s not 
pissed at you.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s a plus,&quot; Touga agreed.</pre>
