<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 6 of 21)</h1>

<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The darkness slowly lightened, and the sun rose up over the city. It 
climbed across the blue sky, fell behind the towers, and once again 
night gently fell across Tokyo. And the vampires stirred from their 
day&#39;s slumber.

Utena looked out into the night, quietly asking, &quot;Anthy, were your 
contacts able to dig anything up on Mrs. Ohtori?&quot;

Anthy shook her head, &quot;Their records go back hundreds of years, but 
there&#39;s no direct information on her. Just rumor and legend.&quot; She 
frowned worriedly, &#39;The Hellsing organization prides itself on knowing 
about the world&#39;s vampires, how could they not know about her?&#39;

&quot;So what do you want to do now?&quot; Juri asked Utena softly.

&quot;I&#39;ve got an appointment tonight,&quot; Utena smiled wryly, &quot;and it might 
be important to keep it. Can you and Anthy guard the others until I 
come back?&quot;

&quot;But what if you run into Mrs. Ohtori out there?&quot; Juri raised her 
eyebrow.

Utena actually laughed softly, &quot;Then that solves everybody&#39;s problem, 
since she&#39;s mostly after me anyway.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t solve my problem,&quot; Juri muttered, &quot;she&#39;s still got Shiori.&quot;

&quot;Go see Miyu,&quot; Anthy said to her intensely, &quot;then come right back 
here. The only chance we&#39;ll have is if we all face her together.&quot; She 
actually smiled slightly, &quot;You won&#39;t be protecting us if you choose to 
try and face her alone.&quot;

Utena smiled wryly, &quot;You know me too well.&quot; She held up two fingers 
and smiled, &quot;I swear I won&#39;t try to take on Mrs. Ohtori alone.&quot;

Juri&#39;s lips quirked slightly, &quot;Were you ever a girl scout?&quot;

&quot;Well, no,&quot; a smiling Utena shrugged, &quot;but I thought that&#39;s better 
than swearing on vampire&#39;s honor or something.&quot; With that, she walked 
over to the door and was gone.

Utena walked out into the night, feeling the cool night air on her 
pale skin. She stopped to look up at the full moon, for a moment 
looking almost like a ghost. She moved across the city quickly, not 
worrying about being seen. After tonight, it might not matter anyway.

It took only a few moments for her to reach the shrine. Utena shivered 
a bit, feeling that odd sensation once again. &#39;I wonder if it&#39;s 
because this is a holy place?&#39; she wondered. A slight smile, &quot;Or maybe 
it&#39;s something Miyu does intentionally.&#39;

Utena walked up the steps, passing under the wooden archway, when a 
voice said, &quot;Enter here freely and of your own will.&quot;

Utena blinked, looking over at Miyu sitting casually by the front 
entrance of the shrine building itself. She looked deceptively like a 
pale little girl, but the aura of power around her was anything but 
childlike. &quot;Isn&#39;t that a line from a Dracula movie?&quot; Utena asked.

Miyu actually smiled slightly, &quot;Nothing wrong with taking from the 
classics.&quot;

Utena had to smile at that, just a little. &quot;You said that you wanted 
to see me tonight?&quot; she asked as formally as she could manage.

Miyu&#39;s voice was soft, almost a whisper as she asked, &quot;When you came 
here last night, you had questions?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Utena blinked. Quietly, she asked her, &quot;Is there a cure 
for vampirism? Is there a way to become human once again?&quot;

Miyu looked a bit surprised, not having expected that question first. 
Her expression was sad as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. There is no cure, that 
I know of.&quot;

Utena didn&#39;t actually flinch, but her eyes darkened sadly. &quot;Thank 
you,&quot; she nodded slightly. &#39;Should I ask her about my powers,&#39; Utena 
wondered, &#39;or Mrs. Ohtori?&#39;

&quot;Why not ask me about both?&quot; Miyu smiled.

&quot;You can read my thoughts?&quot; Utena blinked in surprise.

Miyu chuckled softly, &quot;Not very easily, but yes.&quot;

&quot;What can you tell me about Mrs. Ohtori?&quot; Utena asked her softly.

&quot;We&#39;ve crossed swords a few times,&quot; Miyu met Utena&#39;s blue eyes, &quot;she&#39;s 
very strong, and quite devious as well.&quot;

&quot;Stronger than you?&quot; Utena asked thoughtfully.

Miyu&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, &quot;Possibly.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Utena shrugged.

&quot;Ohtori is a vindictive woman, Utena,&quot; Miyu cautioned her, &quot;she does 
not let go of any wrong that has been done to her.&quot;

&quot;Or to her family,&quot; Utena sighed softly. Her long pink hair blew 
around her, the breeze blowing strongly around them both. She met 
Miyu&#39;s eyes. &quot;Are my powers enough to face her?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Miyu admitted. &quot;A vampire as young as you should not 
have the power that you do, at best you would be able to compel 
another to your will,&quot; she said. A grim little smile, &quot;And any vampire 
older than you could command you easily.&quot;

&quot;The vampire who created me tried to command me,&quot; Utena murmured, &quot;I 
skewered him on a wooden practice sword.&quot;

&quot;You defied the vampire who sired you?&quot; Miyu blinked. &quot;That astounds 
me more than the abilities you&#39;ve shown,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;Are there any other vampires who have had powers like mine?&quot; Utena 
asked.

&quot;Not as young as you,&quot; Miyu shook her head, &quot;it appears that you are 
unique.&quot;

Utena felt... something. A chill in her bones. She met Miyu&#39;s eyes, &quot;I 
think I need to go. Thank you, for your help.&quot;

&quot;I wish I could have been more help,&quot; Miyu murmured as she watched the 
pink haired young woman walk away.

A few moments later Himiko and Larva emerged from the shadows, 
settling down to Miyu&#39;s side. &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll return?&quot; Larva 
asked softly.

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Miyu murmured softly.

&quot;From what I heard you didn&#39;t tell her everything that you told me,&quot; 
Himiko said quietly, looking over at Miyu curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s not ready to hear that,&quot; Miyu said, &quot;not ready to hear the 
legends of the vampires. Not ready for the Power of Dios, or for the 
legend of the power to revolutionize the world.&quot;

Across the dark city of Tokyo, Mrs. Ohtori smiled slightly, reaching 
out to stroke Shiori&#39;s cheek. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; the older woman asked.

&quot;Please, Mistress,&quot; Shiori moaned softly.

Mrs. Ohtori drew the girl down to her breast, gasping as the younger 
girl&#39;s fangs pierced her flesh. &quot;Yes,&quot; she crooned, &quot;feed on my blood, 
take my strength into you.&quot; She stroked down the girl&#39;s back, 
caressing her rounded bottom.

Shiori shuddered happily, feeding on her hungrily. Her own hands began 
to move, caressing searchingly that aristocratic woman&#39;s body. 
Afterwards, they lay together, contented in the glow that filled both 
their bodies.

&quot;Little one,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori said softly, &quot;you must leave me, soon.&quot;

Shiori looked up at her in surprise, a bit of blood still clinging 
around her mouth, &quot;But why, Mistress?&quot;

&quot;You will return to Juri and the others,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori smiled slightly, 
&quot;they will accept you back easily.&quot; She stroked the cheek, &quot;I want you 
to watch, and listen. Tell me about Tenjou Utena, and about the power 
that she possesses.&quot;

&quot;I will obey, my Mistress,&quot; Shiori sighed softly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori rose, gently pulling the slim girl up beside her. 
&quot;It must be convincing, that you escaped from me,&quot; she said, raising 
her fist. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she added, as the first blow hammered Shiori to 
the floor....
