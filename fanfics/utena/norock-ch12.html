&quot;Brrr...it&#39;s getting cold out here! How long are we gonna have to stand 
on this stupid rooftop anyway?&quot; Wakaba rubbed her arms to emphasize her 
point as Saionji sighed. They were standing out on the roof balcony of 
one of the school buildings, which was located centrally in front of the 
main school gates. It was their job to keep an eye out for the arrival 
of the fake Utena or any of those damn pesky Swords. But Wakaba seemed 
to find the whole affair a chore. Rubbing his eyes tiredly, he responded 
coolly.

&quot;It&#39;s not getting cold. You&#39;re just nervous.&quot; He muttered rolling his 
eyes, before reaching out an arm towards her. Wakaba stuck out her 
tongue, but dutifully came over to snuggle against him. Together, they 
looked out over the shadowed courtyards and silent buildings. Nothing 
moved except a scattering of dead leaves now and then, stirred on the 
breath of a breeze. His violet eyes scanned back and forth mechanically, 
as he stroked the top of her head. He could feel her smaller warmth 
pressing into his chest, rising and falling with each breath. 
Peaceful...so..so peaceful...

He looked down at the engagement ring glinting on her finger as he gave 
her forehead a kiss. &quot;Hey...listen...when all of this...when it&#39;s 
over...do you want to go ahead and, you know...get married? I mean...we 
don&#39;t have to but...&quot;

Saionji trailed off with a small cough into his hand, feeling 
embarrassed. He had changed a lot from his younger days, but he was 
still awkward when it came to these sorts of things. Wakaba turned in 
his arms enough to look at him. The happiness of her smile was dizzying, 
making Saionji feel light headed. How had he ever gotten so lucky?

&quot;Yes! Oh yes, Sai-chan...I&#39;d like that so much! &quot; She swatted his 
stomach with the back of her hand giving him an admonishing look. &quot;I&#39;ve 
been waiting to get hitched to you since high school.&quot; Saionji gave a 
low chuckle at that, hugging her close again.

&quot;Well maybe we--&quot;

He was cut off by Wakaba, stiffening up in fright in his arms. Panicked, 
Saionji looked at the gates in time to see half a dozen sets of 
headlights coming up the hill and stopping jerkily in front of the now 
open school gates. Climbing from the cars came the dark figures of men 
and women, oily smooth. As graceful as snakes or eels. It made his skin 
crawl. Giving a low hiss, Saionji gave a push to Wakaba.

&quot;Damn, they&#39;re here already! We need to let the other&#39;s know. Hurry back 
and tell them, I&#39;ll distract them here and keep an eye on things!&quot;

&quot;B-But---&quot;

&quot;Go! Get Touga and the others. This is where we need to make our final 
stand. The others are still being healed by Anthy, we need to buy more 
time!&quot;

Saionji gave her a firm push towards the stairs, and the two ran down 
them, separating at the bottom. Leaning in quickly, Wakaba grabbed both 
sides of his face and drew him in for a quick desperate kiss. When their 
lips parted, she took off running, her short brown hair bouncing behind 
her as she called over her shoulder.

&quot;You better not get hurt out there, or you&#39;re in so much trouble when 
you get home!!

Saionji gave a ghost of a smile and took off running down the path to 
the courtyard.

The One was standing there, draped in a cloak made of black feathers. 
Her booted foot was tapping impatiently as she scanned the area around 
them, looking for something to take her frustration out on.

They had lost one of their kind. Like a candle being blown out by a 
child at a birthday party, The One and the other eight swords had felt 
the existence of one of their own being snuffed out. True, the Sword of 
Self Hatred had been a pitiful and weak creature...but it had been that 
weakness that had been it&#39;s greatest strength. And now, one of their 
brethren was lost to them, diminishing their numbers.

This...

Was not...

Allowed.

Eyes blazing like coals in the night, the sword inhabiting the Prince&#39;s 
body turned to its generals flanking behind her as they stepped out of 
limos and cars. They each looked to her expectantly, silently awaiting 
her orders. With hair that now cascaded down her back, curling in with 
the tendrils of her coat, the pink haired woman gave the school grounds 
a disdainful look.

&quot;Well now...here again. Isn&#39;t this nostalgic. Let&#39;s go and greet our 
hosts for this little soir&eacute;e, shall we?&quot; She smirked as she felt a pair 
of arms twine themselves about her body. Nanami leaned her head in to 
rub along her cheek, letting her hands slide low.

&quot;Mmmm...can I personally kill her? Oh please?&quot; Nanami gazed into Utena&#39;s 
eyes, the silver of her own smoldering. Utena moved to caress her cheek 
before clenching her hand tight around her jaw enough to make the sword 
whimper in pain. With a cold expression, she tossed the girl onto the 
ground in front of them hard enough to crack the cobblestones.

&quot;Fool. You will do as you are told, or you risk ending up like him. 
She&#39;s off limits to you.&quot; The One turned on her heel and stalked away, 
her leather pants barely creaking for the way they were practically 
painted onto her skin. Jared and his father stepped forward to greet 
her. The mohawked young body now possessed by something far more rigid. 
Utena held up a hand to halt them, her eyes narrowing as she scoured the 
darkness with inhuman eyes. In her mind, she could see two glowing 
beacons in the darkness...the warmth that came from power and 
purity...such tasty treats. She watched them split apart, one slipping 
farther into the shadows while the other headed straight for them.

Oh goody...

Smirking again, Utena snapped her fingers and unhurriedly pointed at the 
fleeing form of Wakaba heading for the tower.

&quot;Gentlemen? Do me a favor won&#39;t you? Take Nanami-chan and go have a good 
time.&quot; Jared&#39;s father gave a regal nod of his head while Jared smiled 
sweetly. Picking up Nanami by the shoulders and leading her away, they 
were gone in a blur of movement.

When Saionji had come within sight, Utena stepped back as her comrades 
stepped forward to meet him, closing their ranks to fill in the gap of 
her passing. Blowing the green man a kiss, she stalked away on swaying 
hips. &quot;Kill him messily. I hate the color green.&quot; Eric tossed her head 
back and gave a deep-throated laugh as a curving blade materialized in 
her open hand. She stepped forward to meet him first, licking her lips. 
Utena chuckled as she walked away. She motioned for Jak, who was still 
sitting on top of the hood of a car, to follow her.

&quot;In the meantime, I think I&#39;ll go hunting...&quot;

&quot;Juri-san, please hold still. I really do need to make sure that your 
shoulder is healed.&quot; Anthy sighed as Juri twitched her arm away for the 
third time. She was busy looking over to where Akio was speaking quietly 
on the arm of the couch, where Shiori was sharpening her sword. Shiori 
smiled at something he said and he nodded in response to a question of 
hers. Juri looked back in annoyance at Anthy when her arm was tugged 
somewhat impatiently.

&quot;What? Look, my shoulder is fine. I hardly think-&quot; Her words ended in a 
painful hiss as the dark skinned woman pushed experimentally on a place 
just below her shoulder blade. Juri managed to not move again when Anthy 
huffed and began prodding the area.

&quot;Yes yes, it&#39;s certainly fine. But perhaps for my peace of mind, you&#39;ll 
let me take a look anyway.&quot; Juri frowned at the tone Anthy spoke with 
but couldn&#39;t help looking back to where Shiori was still speaking to 
that bastard Akio...

&quot;Juri...&quot;

Juri looked up as her name was spoken without an honorific. Anthy was 
looking at her with a grave expression.

&quot;Juri, I know you dislike my brother. I know, I really do. No one is 
asking that you two suddenly become best friends and chat like 
girlfriends.&quot; Juri&#39;s frown twitched at that horribly ridiculous image. 
Imagining Akio wearing pigtails and a skirt brought the corner of her 
mouth up just a hair. But her feelings for that man were enough to 
return her to her irritation.

&quot;But...this situation is not the same as it was all those years ago. 
We&#39;ve all changed. So...I don&#39;t think you need to worry about 
Shiori-san&#39;s safety. My brother will not be hurting anyone again.&quot; That 
last bit was said with quiet steel in her voice, making Juri look at her 
evenly.

&quot;I can&#39;t get past my feelings for him. I hate what that manipulative 
bastard did to us. What he made us do.&quot;

&quot;I had quite the hand in that as well.&quot;

&quot;Yes but--&quot;Juri sighed as Anthy laid a glowing hand on her shoulder. The 
magazine owner could feel the tissue unknit and the muscles smooth 
beneath her attentive movements. &quot;It&#39;s not the same. You&#39;ve been looking 
for Utena, and you&#39;ve changed completely-&quot;


&quot;And you think my brother did not?&quot;

&quot;I will admit he is different, and perhaps he really will try to atone 
for what he has done. I also think he hasn&#39;t changed like you have.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Anthy sighed quietly. &quot;He has changed even more...&quot;

With this somewhat cryptic statement, Anthy stood and smoothed down her 
pants legs. Then she turned and headed over to where Shiori and Akio 
were lounging quietly, motioning for Shiori to follow her over to where 
the table was. The short haired girl did so, smiling, and let Anthy 
finish up her job of healing the various cuts and scrapes on her legs 
and arms. Akio stood there a moment, quietly watching them. Then he 
strode over to where Juri still sat on the floor, checking her foil. 
After a time, he spoke.


&quot;Quite a charming woman you&#39;ve pledged yourself to, Arisugawa-san. Be 
certain to treasure her.&quot;

Juri looked up at him with an arched eyebrow. &quot;I do. Every single day.&quot;

Akio looked wistful. &quot;That is good. The love of another person is a 
powerful shield. It can even save you from yourself.&quot;

They fell back into an uncomfortable silence, both watching the two 
women at the table. Then Juri broke the silence with a casual question. 
&quot; What happened to your fianc&eacute;e, Kanae-san?&quot;

Akio smiled slightly then. &quot;Wife now. She&#39;s staying with her mother for 
a while, we had an...argument.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...Kanae-san has become quite strong minded since we first met. Our 
opinions clashed over something petty, and now we&#39;re...trying to work 
through it.&quot;

Now Juri was intrigued. Akio was looking away casually, his posture 
perfectly relaxed. But her keen observation caught a slight crinkle in 
his forehead. A flinch around his eyes. She smiled slowly as she cocked 
her head to the side. &quot;Now, forgive me for the rudeness of a personal 
question...but I&#39;ve known you to be quite the charmer in the past, 
easily smoothing over any situation. What could Kanae-san possibly have 
you by the balls on?&quot;

Akio frowned at the vulgarity of the phrasing but refused to acknowledge 
it. He crossed his arms instead and regarded her warily. &quot;That is indeed 
quite a personal question. And I&#39;m not so certain our relationship 
extends far enough to warrant an answer.&quot;

Juri just continued to grin wider, waiting patiently. Akio sighed.

&quot;You are relentless my dear, and resemble Kozue-chan at the moment.&quot;

&quot;So you won&#39;t answer?&quot;

&quot;...I will...on the agreement that the conversation will go no farther 
than the two of us. It is something embarrassing in nature.&quot;

Juri smiled smugly in victory, but inclined her head in agreement. Akio 
sighed and massaged his face with a hand as he answered.

&quot;My wife is wanting children.&quot;

Juri blinked, not quite sure she had heard correctly.

&quot;She feels we are both getting on in our years, and wants a child of our 
own. By I have never been one to...enjoy raising small people.&quot;

Juri was silent for a moment. Then she gave a slight cough to try and 
hold in her laughter.

&quot;A-Ah...ah-ha...I see...yes well, I can see how that may result in a 
conflict.&quot;

Akio looked irritated by her mirth but shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s come up before, 
but now it&#39;s more of an issue. I don&#39;t consider myself a father figure.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t consider you one either.&quot; Juri replied dryly.

&quot;For different reasons I&#39;m sure. But...it is something we will work 
through for good or ill. I am simply thankful she is away for the 
moment. I do not want her near this. I...&quot; He trailed off looking down 
at his still filthy hands. &quot;...Lack the means to protect her.&quot;

Juri frowned, sensing an underlying issue. &quot;But from what I&#39;ve seen, you 
are still quite capable with a sword. And you&#39;re wits haven&#39;t 
deteriorated over the years.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not that old, Arisugawa-san.&quot; Akio replied just as dryly.

&quot;So what&#39;s the real problem?&quot; She wasn&#39;t really sure why she was all 
that concerned in the first place. As soon as this was all over, she 
planned to take Shiori and head back to the city, never coming near the 
man again. Maybe she was just dealing with boredom...

Akio looked into the space before him, eyes staring into something she 
could not see. He didn&#39;t answer for several breaths, clearly working 
through something in his memory. Then he looked at her with a gaze that 
seemed to pierce through her very core. It made her stiffen, her brow 
knitting as he simply stood there looking at her. When he spoke, it was 
in a voice so soft, she felt herself leaning forward to catch his words.

&quot;Let me ask you a question, Juri.&quot; He had switched to an informal use of 
her name, like his sister had done earlier. But instead of becoming 
irritated at it, the orange-curled woman found herself feeling 
apprehensive. It was like she was a child, looking into the face a being 
that had seen everything and knew everything about her...

Stop it Juri. He&#39;s just a washed up old man.

&quot;What?&quot; she asked, just as softly. Akio&#39;s eyes never left her, but his 
hands made graceful gestures in the air before them as he spoke.

&quot;Imagine yourself at the prime of your life, full of unlimited 
power...beauty...prestige. Everyone loves you, wants to be loved by you, 
and you have the responsibility to care for and protect them all.&quot; 
Nearly against her will, Juri found herself recalling the highlights of 
her life. Being named on the Student Council in school, winning the 
trophies for fencing, gaining her job as a sought-after model, and 
living with her old friend and Shiori back as children.

&quot;You are a leader, you are confident, and everything goes as you foresee 
and plan. You are strong enough to face any dragon, and your days are 
filled with joy and hope and light.&quot;

In her mind, Juri could still see Shiori&#39;s delicate hand offering her 
that rose that was so close in shade to her hair...

&quot;...And then something happens that strips all of that from you in an 
instant.&quot;

...And that hand crumpled around the petals...

Akio looked tired and weary as he sat down next to her. He rested his 
arms on his knees and frowned. &quot;That&#39;s what happened to me, like it or 
not. First because of my sister in a bid for kindness. Then by 
Utena-chan in a bid for retribution. I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t deserve 
it...but my sister was always the one who held power. Not me.&quot;

His green eyes seemed bottomless as he stared into her own. For a 
moment, Juri could almost see herself.

&quot;I was just a boy with a sword, playing at a game bigger than me. Now 
I&#39;m an old man with years gone I&#39;ll never get back. That&#39;s the real 
problem.&quot; Then the look was gone and he was shrugging elegantly, 
laughing it all off as a joke.

&quot;What good is a sword in your hand, when the world doesn&#39;t need 
Princes?&quot;

Juri wanted to ask more, but bit her tongue. Shiori gave a small wave 
and Juri smiled and waved back. Akio nodded to Shiori as well, not 
taking his eyes off of her as he spoke low enough for only Juri to hear.

&quot;That&#39;s your sword. Use it well.&quot;

Wakaba was running as fast as she could for the elevator to the tower. 
Why couldn&#39;t they have cool little radios or walkie-talkies or 
something? Or maybe communicators like a super hero. If they were all 
really Duelists, shouldn&#39;t they have gotten matching uniforms and cool 
little wrist communicators? And why was she thinking about the Super 
Ninja Rangers show at a time like this?!

She huffed as her katana bounced against her thigh as she ran. Ugh. 
Thank goodness she had worn low heels.

She got to the button, and began pushing it frantically. Oh geez...this 
was just ridiculous. She hadn&#39;t been able to find Touga or Kozue at the 
East gate. Had they moved? Why couldn&#39;t people just stay put? The button 
lit up, but the elevator was taking it&#39;s time coming down.

&quot;Oh come on already!&quot; Wakaba impatiently tapped her foot. Right now her 
Sai-chan was trying to-

She was suddenly tackled from the side.

With a gasp of pain, she hit the cement walkway and skidded into the 
grass. There was someone sitting on top of her! Wincing, the side of her 
face stinging like crazy and feeling sticky, she looked wide eyed at a 
curved knife pressed into her nose. There was a man with a mohawk riding 
her stomach with a ghoulish smile on his face.

&quot;Hullo luv, let&#39;s play.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Damn it Touga, I know you have a pack of cigarettes on you somewhere.&quot;

&quot;You smoked my last one. Shouldn&#39;t you be quitting?&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be worrying about your own health? Given the 
circumstances, I think a cancer stick is the least of my worries.&quot;

Touga sighed and ran a hand through his hair. &quot;Do you have a hair clip 
or a hair tie? This is getting in the way.&quot; He gestured to the crimson 
waterfall that spilled along his back and shoulders, framing his 
masculine face. Kozue smirked in response.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just hurry up and hack it off? The hippy look was so last 
season.&quot;

Touga smirked and gave his long hair a feminine toss. &quot;But then what 
would the ladies hold on to?&quot; Kozue grinned and shrugged. &quot;Your ears I 
guess. I wonder what you would look like with a complete buzz cut. 
Probably like a chemo therapy patient.&quot; Touga shook a finger at her 
statement but smiled when she handed him an elastic hair band from the 
pocket of her skirt.

They had been in position at the east school gates, looking for any sign 
of trouble. But something had been bothering Touga lately, and he had 
wanted to speak to Kozue a bit more privately. Silly really, that he 
needed to move at all, since it had only been the two of them at the 
gate in the first place. But he liked the ambiance that the school 
fountains provided. And it put them closer to Saionji and Wakaba&#39;s place 
in case of trouble.

With his hair now in a long ponytail, Kozue had to admit he looked very 
much like his closest friend. Thankfully Touga had not gone the route of 
facial hair. She had always thought the goatee had made Saionji look 
like a stupid pirate. Touga looked at her with a warm smile, his charm 
as strong as it was back in the day. Though even she had to admit she 
liked his more mature bearing now. Touga was yummy any day of the week.

Sitting next to him, her back comfortably resting on him, Kozue sighed 
and fiddled with the sleeve of her borrowed jacket. &quot;What did you wanna 
talk about? And even don&#39;t try and play off that there was nothing 
bothering you.&quot; She gave a sly smile. For his part Touga didn&#39;t even try 
to deny the fact, just inclined his head.

&quot;Yes. I want to talk to you about Nanami.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Saionji was standing his ground, but inside he was shaking. Utena wasn&#39;t 
with them. And if he was counting right, other swords weren&#39;t here. But 
he could have sworn he&#39;d seen her from the roof! But still....five of 
them all on his own. Now he wished he hadn&#39;t been so rash.

With a stony face, Saionji drew his sword and fell into a calm state of 
mind, his thoughts letting go and floating freely to extend to every one 
of his five senses. The kendo master brought his sword up and in front 
of him, as the woman with the shoulder length hair and glasses stalked 
his way like a cat. She licked along the blade of a long knife that had 
materialized in her hand. It glinted in the moonlight, it&#39;s wicked 
angles giving it a european appearance, his mind dully noted.

The girl gave a mocking bow while Saionji remained unmoving, the other 
swords fanning out behind her to form a semi-circle about them. A breeze 
kicked up, making his suit jacket flap at his hips.

&quot;Hey baby...you want a good time? I&#39;ll give you a run for your money.&quot; 
She cooed as she stalked toward him. &quot;I can&#39;t stand guys like you, you 
know...I bet you think you&#39;re hot shit, don&#39;t ya?&quot;

As she came forward in a flash, Saionji caught the blow on his sword and 
struggled. She had beaten him easily last time, with just her bare 
hands. But now things were different. He was different. The spirits of 
100 duelists had seen to that. Grinding their blades against each other, 
Saionji took a step forward and brought his blade around, knocking her 
back. She hissed at him like a cat, and one of the men stepped forward 
swinging a large piece of metal attached to a handle. Grimacing, Saionji 
smoothly stepped to the side and deflected the powerful blow, making 
Mason stumble a bit. But instead of attacking him while his back was 
turned, the girl named Eric screeched and lunged out at her fellow 
sword.

&quot;Stop butting in! You&#39;re always like that! Back off, I&#39;m going to cut 
his pretty little face myself!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have rank over me, sister. I do as I please. And I&#39;m looking 
for blood.&quot; He cast the girl aside from where she was striking him with 
her fists and made a sharp cut at Saionji&#39;s head. The two of them 
clashed, striking up sparks in the twilight. The girl bit down on the 
tip of her thumb as she looked on, her fist white-knuckled around the 
knife hilt. She shook with emotion. &quot;It&#39;s not fair...it&#39;s just not 
fair...I could have been number two.&quot; She snarled around the digit.

Mason and Saionji ignored her, the tanned American using his sword more 
like a club than anything, as he struck down hard again and again. He 
used brute strength, something Saionji was once known well for. But out 
of the two of them, it was Saionji surprisingly who kept his cool. His 
hair flew behind him as they whirled, attacked, and counter attacked. 
The shaved skinhead&#39;s face wore a wolfish glee, as he finally managed to 
knick the kendoist in the shoulder.

&quot;Yeah baby, yeah! Bleed for me!!&quot;

Saionji glared back, rearing for another strike. Until Miki came up 
behind him and kicked him hard in the back of the head. Saionji&#39;s eyes 
rolled up in their sockets as he stumbled before he doubled over, 
holding his head with one hand as he twisted to look behind him. Miki 
Kaoru, shoulders back superiorly, held a foil in his hand that dripped 
with something dark enough to look black in the darkness. It took 
Saionji a minute to realize his back was bleeding. He had been cut from 
behind.

&quot;So sorry, Saionji Kyouichi. But you see this is our battle to win. And 
I&#39;m afraid your existence can no longer be tolerated, in the face of the 
truly deserving.&quot;

Giving an elegant courtly bow, Miki struck in a motion that was too 
quick to follow with the eyes...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Kozue frowned and looked at Touga. The seriousness behind his pleasant 
face couldn&#39;t be shrugged off. Still, she tried to play dumb.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&quot; She replied, giving a small lift of her 
shoulders. Touga chuckled and put an arm around her hugging her close.-

&quot;Yes you do. Who was it that said something about &#39;not playing&#39;? Please 
Kozue...I know about your job.&quot;

Kozue shot him a dangerous look, feeling affronted. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with 
being a hostess for lingerie parties? It&#39;s very popular these days with 
the right crowd. You&#39;d be surprised how much fun girls can have trying 
on underwear, and watching others wear them. I always have fun.&quot;

&quot;So I see. But my sister has been attending these sort of parties more 
and more lately, and I was beginning to wonder why. Then I came to a 
revelation that perhaps it wasn&#39;t simply the parties themselves that 
interested her...but a particular hostess instead.&quot;

Kozue looked back at him, her lower jaw jutting out defiantly.

&quot;So. What you&#39;re asking is: Am I sleeping with your sister?&quot;

Touga smiled, like one would to a child being silly. &quot;That was never in 
question. I know you are, Kozue-chan.&quot; Kozue&#39;s expression fell, and for 
a moment she felt a brief flutter of...something. Apprehension perhaps, 
or maybe guilt. Nervousness? Surely not.

&quot;...Then what are you asking me, Touga?&quot;

His smile melted away, leaving his face bleak and empty. There was a 
pity there in those blue eyes, that the younger woman didn&#39;t like at 
all.

&quot;Did you break my sister&#39;s heart?&quot;

But before she could even consider an answer, a cry ripped through the 
night air startling them both. Swearing violently, Kozue clamored to her 
feet and took off in the direction. Running beside her on longer legs, 
Touga muttered low. &quot;That was Saionji&#39;s voice. Looks like we missed our 
entrance cue.&quot;

Kozue, baring her teeth, withdrew her foil and forced her feet to move 
faster.

Anthy and Shiori were engaged in polite small talk, when they heard the 
elevator begin to rumble downward. Surprised, the talk instantly dropped 
as they hastily got to their feet and hurried over to it. Someone had 
pushed the button below...and the only reason they would have done that 
was...

Akio and Juri hurried to their side, both looking grim though each 
carried it off smoothly. Shiori leaned her face against the iron gates, 
cocking her ear as she tried to pick up a sound...

She almost thought she had heard...

Anthy&#39;s head snapped up, as her face drained of color. Grabbing her 
brother by the shoulder she pointed down at the floor beneath them. 
&quot;Wakaba has been attacked! I felt a flash of pain through the link I 
forged between us at the Memorial Hall! She is being hurt even now, we 
have to get down there immediately!&quot; Shiori gasped and leaned back away 
from the gates. Looking afraid, she fretted and twisted her hands 
together.

&quot;What can we do? We&#39;re not going to get there in time!&quot;

&quot;Oh yes we will.&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes flashed a bright green, that swallowed up 
her pupils and spread past the whites of her eyes. Her hair rose up like 
a nest of live snakes, whipping about in an invisible wind. Akio&#39;s eyes 
widened, not having seen this particular show before. When had his 
sister gained so much power? It was as if... His eyes narrowed in 
understanding. Well well...

&quot;Give me your hands, and please trust me!&quot; She ordered pulling out a 
deck of playing cards. Tossing them up into the air, they took on a life 
of their own and began circling and spinning in place, moving to form a 
sphere about the four of them. Juri and Shiori moved at the same time, 
each clasping a brown hand. Akio stepped between them, placing each of 
his own atop theirs, so that their paler ones were completely encased. 
Akio nodded to his sister and closed his eyes. Juri and Shiori took his 
lead and tilted their heads back as they closed theirs.

A roaring wind began to surround them, tugging at their hair and 
clothes.

&quot;Don&#39;t hold your breath. And try not to scream.&quot;

The floor beneath their feet rippled like water, and with a loud sucking 
noise, the sphere of cards and it&#39;s passengers plunged down through the 
tower.

&quot;Outta the way, shit head!&quot; Kozue yelled as she punched a girl in 
glasses in the face. Damn, but that was something she always wanted to 
do at least once... The girl herself gave a small grunt, but didn&#39;t seem 
to notice that her nose was broken. Blood flowed freely down her face.

&quot;Owh? Veesiters?&quot; She hacked out a ball of congealed blood as she 
straightened from her knocked-back position. She grinned, the sight less 
than pretty, Kozue found. The navy haired woman gave a disgusted sneer. 
&quot;Ewww...don&#39;t give me bedroom eyes looking like that. You aren&#39;t even in 
my league, sweetheart.&quot; Kozue blew a kiss, making the other girl fume 
angrily.

&quot;Yer twype id awl awike! Led&#39;s see how preddy you ahre when I strip you 
down to da bowne!&quot; Kozue easily parried her strike, her foil swishing 
through the air. Maybe it was the little bit of juice from the Mikage 
ghost, but Kozue found she could see every single movement of her 
opponent&#39;s. While she didn&#39;t notice the rose sigil glowing on her cheek, 
Touga did. But he didn&#39;t bother commenting on it. Instead he helped lift 
Saionji up by the shoulders, getting him on his feet.

&quot;Are you okay, Sai-chan?&quot; Touga teased as he blocked a strike from Miki, 
before shifting out of the way of a charging Mason. Saionji regained his 
senses and put himself at Touga&#39;s back.

&quot;Don&#39;t call me &#39;Sai-chan&#39;...only my soon-to-be-wife can.&quot; Saionji dead 
panned, switching places with Touga as his sword whirled elegantly 
through the air. Miki&#39;s arm blossomed in red as he reared back to 
safety.

&quot;Oh? Oh but Sai-chan...I played the part of &#39;wife&#39; now and then, when 
we-&quot;

&quot;Focus on fighting, okay!?!&quot; Saionji was blushing hotly as Touga 
laughed. The two of them mirrored one another&#39;s movements perfectly, 
taking out Mason with a pair of swift cuts.

&quot;Listen.&quot; Saionji spoke urgently. His blush was beginning to fade. 
&quot;There are far too many of them for us to just try and stab one at a 
time. We need to weaken them first, to buy us some time. I haven&#39;t got 
it all, but those two are easy to pick out.&quot; he gestured to Mason and 
Eric.

&quot;The girl has to do with...with jealousy or something I think. She even 
attacks her own sometimes. The big one over there is just plain 
bloodlust. Hating anyone getting in his way and hating having to stop 
the fight. I&#39;ve seen it enough times to recognize it.&quot;

Touga nodded in agreement, watching the near lustful look on his face as 
Mason licked along his own hand. He was beginning to foam at the mouth, 
his breaths ragged and harsh.

&quot;How do we intend to use that against them? We&#39;ll need some sort of 
symbolism.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been a little busy here to be thinking about that. Aren&#39;t plans 
and schemes generally your department, Touga?&quot; Touga smiled in 
amusement.

&quot;You nearly make it sound like a bad thing. Hold on.&quot; Touga stepped 
back, looking about for something he could use. He hunted in his 
pockets, finding nothing immediate. What? What could he use for 
symbolism? He wracked his brains trying to think. He&#39;d start with the 
girl.

Jealousy...the opposite of jealousy would be something like 
geniality...liberality.... perhaps even generosity? So what represents 
generosity? Maybe trust or pride...We can&#39;t use flowers, because all we 
have here are roses...perhaps a drawing? Maybe numbers...or...or 
animals...

Hitting on an idea, he called out to Saionji. &quot;Quickly! Do you have 
anything on you with...with a wolf or something?&quot;

Saionji looked at him as if he had lost his mind. But Kozue, from where 
she was tackling her twin onto the ground, gave a strangled yell.

&quot;I-I have a credit card!! I-In my skirt!!&quot;

Rushing over to her side, and kicking Miki in the side for good measure 
(for which he was certain he&#39;d be reprimanded for by his sister later) 
Touga plunged his hands into the pockets of Kozue&#39;s skirt without 
permission. He finally found a slender wallet, and quickly he fumbled 
through it. The plastic rectangles were tossed haphazardly over his 
shoulder until he finally found what he was looking for. Taking the 
card, he strode in three aggressive steps and slapped it onto Eric&#39;s 
chest. Her face spasmed and with a cry she went rigid.

&quot;Keep the other two busy!!&quot; He called, Taking her by the waist and 
drawing the girl tight against him. Using his ankle, he hooked her leg 
and knocked her off-balance against him. The credit card stayed firmly 
on her sternum. It crackled with static, flecks of something floating 
off of it. The sword screamed in pain, as Touga drew his head down to 
speak into her ear.

&quot;Sword...you represent hate that comes from...jealousy...&quot; the sword 
bristled and shivered inside its human sheath. &quot;I offer a symbol that 
stands for loyalty and pride; of love and faithfulness. The wolf mates 
for life, and sees those around it with the eyes of a pack mate. None 
are truly beneath it, and like the wolf, you too are beautiful in your 
own way...I do not know who has hurt you, but I offer my admiration for 
your strength, and my respect for your ability.&quot;

The card buzzed with electricity that threatened to make it rise 
completely off the girl&#39;s skin as she twisted and reared against him. 
Seeing his opportunity, Touga brought his sword around, and timed her 
spastic contortions. When she reared to the left again, mouth hanging 
open in silent rage, he stabbed her through the heart with his katana. 
She shivered against him, the sword blade glowing white hot, then fell 
quiet. From her gaping throat, poured out the spirit that had inhabited 
her. It boiled out into the air above them like a silver mist. When it 
had completely exited, the girl gave a sigh and her eyes fluttered shut. 
Touga gently set the dead weight of her sleeping body down to the 
ground, careful not to let her glasses fall. Then he turned his 
attention to the spirit, the sounds of battle behind him forgotten.

It was a woman, who was twisting the hem of a faded dress. She was 
barefoot and shorthaired, and clearly miserable.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t fair...why did she have to live with him? The Prince was too 
good for her...a witch like her could never be pretty...it must have 
been an illusion. Even though that&#39;s obvious, he only ever smiled for 
her...&quot;

The phantom dissipated, leaving no trace of her existence behind. Miki 
had broken loose from Kozue&#39;s hold and was now trying to double-team 
Saionji. Mason seemed intent on trying to tear off the other man&#39;s head 
with his bare hands, and Kozue had leapt onto his back to try and pull 
him off. Seeing Touga finally free, she gave a desperate jerk of her 
head.

&quot;A little help here?&quot;

Miki cried out in righteous fury, as another of his siblings was lost. 
The odds were beginning to shift unfavorably.

One minute Jared had been contentedly stabbing the brown haired duelist 
in the thigh. The next minute he found himself picked up completely off 
of the ground and hurled into a bush. The bitch-witch had brought 
unwelcome guests to his private party. And one of them was the body that 
used to house one of his own.

&quot;Oy! No one throws me so casually, Akio my boy! You ought to know that.&quot; 
Jared picked himself up and lifted up his saber. He disliked 
interruptions, but this one didn&#39;t look like it planned to go away 
anytime soon. &quot;Come on then, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got old man.&quot;

Anthy had Wakaba cradled in her arms, casting a protective spell around 
them both, while Juri and Shiori took positions at Akio&#39;s side. Seeing 
himself out-numbered, the sword smiled and shook its head sadly.

&quot;My my...what games these mortals play. How&#39;s it feel to play for that 
side again?&quot; He wiggled his eyebrows at Akio who gave a gentle shrug. 
Not getting a rise, Jared scuffed his shoe and gestured to the darkness 
behind him.

&quot;Well fine then. Enough talk.&quot; Nanami and Jared&#39;s father, side by side, 
came running out of the blackness. Jared joined them and as a unit they 
attacked, each taking a duelist. Juri found herself paired with the 
grinning mohawked man, Shiori deflected a crashing blow from a bastard 
sword that Jared&#39;s father wielded, and Akio smiled as he exchanged 
parries with Nanami. But instead of fighting fairly, the three of them 
wove in and out of their partners.

Nanami leaned over and helped Jared to score a cut on Juri&#39;s forearm, 
Jared&#39;s father covering for her and forcing Akio to redouble his 
defense. They expertly assisted one another, working together to drive 
back their human enemies. The duelists, however, had no such 
coordination, and were forced back step-by-step.

In frustration, Anthy tried to will her spells to work faster, wishing 
Wakaba would hurry up and wake to help the others. There was a cry of 
irritation, which broke her concentration and made her look up.

&quot;Damn you, hold still!&quot; Juri swore as she tried to aim for the heart. 
But Jared laughed and twisted away, not afraid to use his shoulder and 
side as a shield. His right side was already a mass of torn fabric and 
fresh blood.

&quot;Sorry luv, I do what it takes to win.&quot; But he suddenly stumbled 
wide-eyed as he looked down at his chest. Juri smirked, her distraction 
having been successful.

&quot;Yes, but you forgot to watch your back.&quot;

A sword point protruded from his tee-shirt, stuck directly in his heart. 
Akio stood poised behind him, still holding the sword hilt and shoved it 
in deeper with a cruel twist.

&quot;Disappear, old friend.&quot;

Jared shivered, his eyes rolling up in their sockets as the wound glowed 
hotly. As the spirit escaped from his lips, he crumpled into a heap on 
the ground. The spirit taking the form of an old man that shook his head 
of silver hair. But even as he looked down at them, the night wind blew 
his lower half into nothingness.

&quot;I always pitied how much was put onto your shoulders, young one. It 
wasn&#39;t fair of them to ask so much, or for your sister to lock you away. 
But then, you never tried to STOP it either...&quot;

Akio sighed and picked up his sword to resume the fight. Wakaba looked 
like she was finally coming around. Besides...he wasn&#39;t that youthful 
little boy anymore...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Damn you both!! Damn you DAMN you!!&quot; Miki shrieked as he ran. Two more 
swords had fallen in a matter of minutes! Where was the One in all of 
this?! Had she left them to die?! To become nothingness and become 
scattered into the abyss? Where was the justice?! He ran and ran, 
feeling the three duelists hot on his heels.

He had felt it happen, even from a distance. And with their close union, 
it had been like a wound in his own heart. They had already lost Hatred 
of Self. Then the sword of Hatred Born of Pity had perished, far from 
him and somewhere close to the tower. But the other...the swords of 
Hatred Formed From Battle and Jealousy...had been extinguished right 
before his very eyes! Where had they gotten this power? This ability to 
fight that they had not possessed before? They were like an entirely new 
group of beings...touched by a god or a power alien to him!

This was not right. This was not how the plan was supposed to go. The 
Thousand Swords were still making their slow procession to the school, 
weighed down by their sheer numbers. And without the One guiding them, 
they were falling individually!

They needed to rethink their approach.

It was time to deviate from the plan...

Heading for the white tower, moving at a speed far faster than a human&#39;s 
Miki reached the place where Nanami and Jared&#39;s father fought against 
four of the duelists. Sneering, he noticed Akio was fighting as well. 
That pathetic man needed to be dealt with.


Materializing his foil once more, Miki ran up directly to the fight, and 
sliced at Juri&#39;s exposed back. She cried out, falling. Taking this 
chance to break up the group, Miki called to her.

&quot;Come come, Juri-senpai...why not show your old student how it&#39;s done, 
eh?&quot;

Angered, Juri got to her feet awkwardly and gave chase, Miki leading her 
away from the others. Understanding the other sword&#39;s intent, Nanami 
gave another swipe at Akio and back-fisted Wakaba who had been working 
to sneak up on her.

Akio heard a cry, and turned distracted. His sister...was no longer 
sitting there. That moment was long enough for the sword in Jared&#39;s 
father to use his supernatural strength and snag a fistful of Akio&#39;s 
hair. The sword yanked him backwards, making the other man cry our in 
surprise. Then coldly, smashed the hilt of his sword into the man&#39;s 
face. Akio groaned and staggered drunkenly, falling to his knees. The 
business-suited man calmly plunged a fist into his windpipe and walked 
away as Akio spasmed and passed out.

The man smiled and gave a bow to the fallen Chairman. Then he made his 
way to where Nanami was keeping the last two children busy....

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Touga and the others were hurrying on their way, hearing the fighting 
from a distance. But what they didn&#39;t expect was for Nanami to come and 
meet them first.

She smirked at their arrival, one hand resting on her hip as she fluffed 
her hair. Her blond hair was in disarray, and the blood staining the 
front of her blouse was not hers. She blew a kiss to her brother, but 
gazed coldly at Kozue.

&quot;A bit late aren&#39;t you? I imagine those two are making short work of 
your friends.&quot;

There were sounds of steel on steel coming from the pathway behind her, 
but with the moon hidden by clouds, they couldn&#39;t make out what was 
happening.

&quot;Why yes...I imagine there&#39;s not much left to pick through. A pity.&quot; She 
pursed her lips, grazing her fingertips over her heart. Touga felt an 
awful sort of anxiety building in him. It had gone far too quiet out 
there...what could be happening? But when he made a move to go around 
her, Nanami stepped in front of him.

&quot;Ah ah ah, Touga-chan. You have me to play with. Just like old times, 
no? Sister and brother, together again.&quot; Her words were mocking, as she 
gestured for him to come and meet her. But Kozue stepped forward 
instead.

&quot;Sorry. But you&#39;ll have to just settle for me.&quot;

Nanami growled, her eyes blazing with a hate so deep it made Touga 
hesitate with caution. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for you.&quot;

&quot;Kozue-chan, can you handle her?&quot;

&quot;Naturally.&quot;

&quot;Very well. We&#39;ll meet you up ahead.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

Nanami stamped her foot, a long curving blade appearing in one hand with 
a smaller dagger in the other. &quot;Don&#39;t just dismiss me!! I&#39;ll cut you to 
ribbons you suckling pig!&quot;

&quot;Have fun, Nanami-chan!&quot; Touga gave a cheerful wave, he and Saionji 
dodging her at the same moment, and running off behind her. Nanami swore 
and made to go after them, but a foil flicked out and grazed along her 
shoulder.

&quot;Not so fast. You and I have things to settle...&quot;

Wakaba and Shiori were dangling in midair, each frantically trying to 
pry off the hands wrapped around their throats. Jared&#39;s father, a stoic 
and stone faced man, was slowly crushing their airways as he pushed them 
even harder into the side of the tower.

&quot;Ye have been judged, weak mortals. And ye have been found guilty.&quot; He 
intoned, his face never changing. He looked specifically at Shiori, his 
lip curling a bit. &quot;It is against the very laws of nature for a gender 
to mate with its own. Such an act is perverse and twisted, to the point 
that only a cleansing will absolve you of your sin.&quot;

Jared&#39;s father smiled benignly as the girls in his hands slowly stopped 
fighting, their heels no longer kicking against the wall.

&quot;I will cleanse you, my children.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Juri was badly wounded, her eye caked in blood and her limbs aching from 
hidden wounds. She couldn&#39;t see where she was, and Miki kept circling 
her. His wounds never seemed to hinder him, despite them being just as 
many as Juri&#39;s herself. He gave an arrogant smirk.

&quot;Do you hear that sound? That&#39;s the sound of your wife, slowly slipping 
into death...ahhh...what a nice sound, the last rattle of life giving 
out.&quot;

Terror striking her heart, Juri turned to run back, but Miki snatched 
her arm from behind and yanked it to pin her. She ground her teeth and 
twisted away, lunging out with her sword again. But her aim was off with 
the loss of her sight. Miki twisted his head to the side and avoided it 
entirely. Laughing, he ducked away. His short blue hair appearing inky 
as it bounced with his movements.

&quot;Does it bother you to not always be in control? I bet it does. She&#39;s so 
far away from your influence, and now she&#39;s dying. That Shinohara girl 
too. Not that either one are worth any tears. If they died so easily, 
they clearly weren&#39;t meant to survive in the first place.&quot;

Juri struck again and again, stumbling this way and that as her heels 
caught and snagged on roots and stones. She fell to her knees cutting 
her palms, but climbed back to her feet.

&quot;Shut up! Is talking all you&#39;re good at? I think I might just have to 
kill myself, to escape your incessant chatter!&quot; she threw a punch, 
barely missing him. Miki Kaoru, the sword glinting in the silver of his 
eyes, shrugged and launched a kick to her ribs. She gave an oomf as the 
wind was knocked from her lungs, and felt her ribs give an awful crack. 
Flying back through the air, she hit her back hard, and felt the shock 
jar all the way through her. Miki walked to her, as she struggled to 
stand. But all she could think of was Shiori.

Her heart ached at the idea that she might be dying somewhere, alone, 
with out her there to comfort her or protect her.

&quot;S....Shiori...I...I....S-Shiori!&quot;

Juri squeezed her eyes shut, wondering why everything was going so 
horribly wrong. But when she opened them, intent on facing her killer 
evenly, she was surprised to see Miki backing up in fear. The sword 
hissed, hands raised in front of him, as another form appeared between 
them.

Glowing with a pure aura that seemed to encase his entire body, was a 
young man. He held no weapon, or seemed to show any hostility of any 
kind. Instead he radiated a kindness that was fortified with an easy 
charm and confidence. Tears in her eyes, Juri looked up in wonder and 
sorrow as the soul of Ruka Tsuchiya bent to help her stand. Juri found 
she was no longer hurting, the pain in her chest gone in a wash of 
gentle warmth. Smiling at her, Ruka cupped her cheek.

&quot;...Ruka...are you....real?&quot;

Eyes flooding with unshed tears, feeling a wash of emotions she hadn&#39;t 
felt in years, Juri blinked to keep them from falling as Ruka brushed 
her cheekbone with his thumb. He felt solid and real, just as he had 
when he had been alive. Smiling back at him, Juri wrapped her arms 
around her former fencing captain and mentor from back in her school 
days.

Hair still falling perpetually into his eyes, blue eyes sparking with 
amusement and caring; the spirit of the former duelist parted his lips 
to speak.

&quot;Hello Juri...I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;
