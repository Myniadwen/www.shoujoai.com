<h1>Utena Muyo! or No Need for Utena! (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/utenamuyo-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Miki looked down at the script wide eyed. &quot;Look, I know I volunteered 
to help build the sets,&quot; he whimpered softly, &quot;but building a set for 
Tsunami?&quot; He slapped the script on to the table, &quot;And Ryo-Ohki? What&#39;s 
a Ryo-Ohki?&quot;

&quot;But Miki-kun,&quot; Nanami batted her eyes at him as she looked up at him 
and said sweetly, &quot;Anthy will be there.&quot;

A pause, and Miki gulped before saying, &quot;Anthy?&quot;

Keiko nodded cheerfully, &quot;Yes, she&#39;s be playing Ayeka.&quot; She smiled, 
&quot;And I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be very impressed with you if you do this.&quot;

Miki looked down at the script with a sigh, picked it up, and wandered 
off muttering softly, &quot;I&#39;ll get to it then.&quot;

Once he was gone Nanami said under her breath, &quot;He is so whipped.&quot; Her 
three cronies solemnly nodded their agreement.

There was a soft knock on the door, and Shiori came in, pulling a 
sniffling Wakaba behind her. &quot;I can&#39;t work with her,&quot; she ranted, 
&quot;she&#39;s such a klutz!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why she&#39;s perfect for Mihoshi,&quot; Keiko beamed.

&quot;See? I&#39;m perfect,&quot; Wakaba boasted, making poor Shiori sweatdrop.
Juri lay back on the stone bench, pretending that she was laying on a 
bed. She smiled seductively up at Utena, &quot;Welcome home, Tenchi.&quot;

Utena gulped visibly, clapped her hands together, and mimed praying.

&quot;Well done, Utena-sama!&quot; Anthy exclaimed.

Utena winced visibly, &quot;That again.&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot; Chu-chu exclaimed.

&quot;No,&quot; Anthy knelt down to the little mouse, &quot;you need to go, Myah!&quot;

&quot;Myah?&quot; Chu-chu managed in his Ryo-Ohki costume.

Juri smoothly got up, &quot;I guess that&#39;s enough for now.&quot; Juri looked 
over at the blushing Utena, &#39;She&#39;s kind of cute that way.&#39;

Anthy smiled and bowed, &quot;I enjoyed out scene together.&quot;

Utena sweatdropped as she squeaked out, &quot;What, where Ayeka&#39;s torturing 
Ryouko and she ends up enjoying it?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Anthy beamed.

Juri chuckled softly, and in a singsong sort of voice quoted Ryouko&#39;s 
line, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m more of a sadist.&quot;

Utena blushed furiously. Under her breath she muttered, &quot;Who on Earth 
picked out this to be a school play, anyway?&quot;

Nanami, strangely, sneezed for no reason.

&quot;Bless you,&quot; Touga remarked absentmindedly.

&quot;Big brother,&quot; Nanami sighed, large throbbing hearts appearing in her 
eyes.

Touga sighed, and left the lunch table.

&quot;I&#39;m the greatest scientific genius in the universe,&quot; Nanami practiced 
her line while on her way back to classes, startling random passerby. 
&quot;Hmm, not quite mad enough,&quot; she muttered to herself softly.

&quot;Mad angry?&quot; the voice asked.

&quot;No, mad insane,&quot; she muttered softly, then suddenly stopped. &#39;Who 
said that?&#39; she looked all around her, but saw nothing but two shadows 
against a wall. She sweatdropped, shook her head, and walked off.

Once she was gone, Shadowplay girl A-ko muttered, &quot;I want to be in the 
play!&quot;

Shadowplay girl B-ko patted her on the shoulder, &quot;But there&#39;s no way.&quot;
Miki looked in shock at his set building crew. &quot;How did they talk you 
all into doing this?&quot; he asked, wide eyed.

Touga glared at him as if it was all his fault, &quot;My darling sister 
Nanami said she&#39;s tell my next date I have an STD.&quot;

&quot;Keiko has taken the precious exchange diary I share with my darling 
Anthy,&quot; Saionji muttered, &quot;and will not return it unless I help you.&quot; 
He stood up straight and pointed to the sky as he loudly declared, 
&quot;Anthy, I love you!&quot;

&quot;You keep an exchange diary?&quot; Miki sweatdropped.

&quot;My reasons for being here are my own,&quot; Akio sniffed.

&quot;Anthy quivered her chin and cried at you, didn&#39;t she?&quot; Touga asked.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Akio admitted.

&quot;Well, lets get to work,&quot; Miki sighed.

&quot;Work?!&quot; all three men exclaimed, and Miki sweatdropped visibly.

Part Three

Shiori sighed softly, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t believe what?&quot; Wakaba asked cutely.

&quot;They were right about you being perfect for this,&quot; Shiori grimaced. 
She looked over at Wakaba. &quot;Try that again.&quot;

Wakaba sat in front of the TV, pretending to watch it. The sound cue 
came on, and she exclaimed, &quot;The emergency signal!&quot;

Wakaba spilled her tea down the front of her costume, pretending to 
cry out in pain. She got up and took a step, tripping over a cable. 
She fumbled for a napkin, bringing a pile of books down on top of her. 
&quot;Owee!&quot;

Shiori laughed, &quot;Perfect.&quot;

Nanami whistled cheerfully, heading for the theater to check up on 
Miki&#39;s progress. The young blue haired man was standing alone, 
directing the efforts of Akio, Touga, Saionji and a few of Touga&#39;s 
girl groupies.

&quot;Do you think the sets will be ready for the first rehearsal?&quot; Nanami 
asked.

Miki turned to her, and she took an involuntary step backwards. His 
eyes were bloodshot, and his hair was standing on end. &quot;For Anthy&#39;s 
sake, it will be done!&quot; he declared.

Nanami shuffled away, &quot;Ooo-kaay.&quot;

She fled the theater, hearing Miki cry out to his crew, &quot;Get back to 
work!&quot; Nanami thought she heard a whip crack, but decided she was just 
hearing things.

&#39;I hope,&#39; she thought with a sigh.

Utena, Juri and Anthy walked by her, apparently in the midst of a 
heated argument. Juri, strangely, was still dressed in her fencing 
uniform, and Utena and Anthy were both carrying long towels with them.

&quot;There are nude scenes in this play?&quot; Utena demanded, her voice coming 
out with a bit of a squeak at the end.

&quot;Of coarse, Utena-sama,&quot; Anthy said pleasantly, &quot;there is a scene set 
in a hot spring. It&#39;s not like we could do it in our clothes.&quot;

&quot;Probably we&#39;ll be wearing body suits, or something, &quot;Juri reassured 
her with a impish little smile. She paused, &quot;So where do you want to 
rehearse?&quot;

&quot;The rose garden,&quot; Utena said firmly. She sighed softly, adding &quot;At 
least in there we won&#39;t have students walking in on us.&quot;

Juri opened the glass door in a gentlemanly fashion, waving the two of 
them inside. &quot;We might as well start with those scenes,&quot; she grinned.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Utena groaned, and Anthy hid a smile.

Juri pretended to be peering over a wall, &quot;This is where you&#39;ve been! 
Come over here.&quot;

Utena spun around, blushing, &quot;But that&#39;s the women&#39;s area.&quot;

Juri came up just behind her, and in a much more sultry sounding voice 
she asked, &quot;Did you saw something?&quot; Utena jerked with surprise, 
pretending that a naked woman had appeared right behind her.

&quot;Well done,&quot; Anthy jumped up happily.

Juri smiled at her, picking up her script. &quot;OK, with a bit of struggle 
on Tenchi&#39;s part,. Ryouko gets him up and over into the girl&#39;s side,&quot; 
she read.

Utena blushed again, averting her gaze from Juri.

Juri came up from behind her, her voice a throaty purr, &quot;What are you 
embarrassed about?&quot; A smile, &quot;You&#39;ve seen me naked before.&quot;

Utena blushed even brighter, for a moment actually loosing her voice. 
&#39;How does she do that?&#39; Utena wondered.

&#39;If she blushes much harder, she&#39;s going to faint,&#39; Juri thought. 
Teasing Utena was such fun, and the way this play was written gave her 
plenty of opportunities. Taking pity, she said aloud, &quot;Let&#39;s move on 
to the fight between Ayeka and Ryouko.&quot;

&quot;How fun,&quot; Anthy clapped her hands.

&#39;What planet is she from?&#39; Utena wondered. She picked up her script 
with a sigh, &quot;Uhm, Ayeka is almost dragged out to the pools by Ryouko, 
having been told that Tenchi is waiting there. She finally decides to 
go in.&quot;

Anthy had the towel wrapped around her, looking like she was ready to 
bathe. She looked over at Utena intensely, focused totally on Utena&#39;s 
gaze. She walks by Juri, who reached out to grab a string attached to 
the towel. In a step, the towel drops away, and Anthy shrieks, 
pretending to dive into the water for modesty.

Anthy grabs at the towel, pulling it her around her as she confronts 
Juri, &quot;I&#39;m not a show off like you!&quot;

Juri smiled as she asked, &quot;You bathe naked, don&#39;t you?&quot; She gazed 
pointedly at Anthy&#39;s breasts, &quot;You&#39;re not proud of yourself, are you? 
I guess I can understand.&quot; She gaze Anthy a dangerous smile, &quot;If what 
I said was offensive, show yourself to me.&quot;

Anthy brings her hand back, pretending to slap Juri.

Juri slaps her twice in reply.

The two women glare at each other, hostility seeming to shimmer in the 
air between them.

&quot;Uhm,&quot; Utena started, only to receive the glares directed at her, 
&quot;never mind.&quot;

Both Anthy and Ryouko smiled suddenly, Juri saying, &quot;Not bad.&quot;

&quot;That was fun,&quot; Anthy agreed.

Both women looked at Utena curiously. Juri asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t think we 
were really fighting, did you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know how much longer I can take this,&quot; Utena muttered.
