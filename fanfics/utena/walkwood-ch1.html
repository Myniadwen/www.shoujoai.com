********************  

Stepping out of the over baring music building and into the sunlight 
she heard the light clink of metal soaring through the air, catching 
the object in her hand without really seeing what it was. Using her 
free hand to block the ominous glare of the sun, her ocean-blue eyes 
narrowed in delight at the devilish smirk before her. She brushed 
aside her topaz hair quickly, sauntering down the steps to the 
undeniably gorgeous and notably dangerous man who was casually leaning 
up against a pristine condition cherry red convertible. She shook her 
head giggling the metallic keys in her hand. And she had been so 
afraid it was going to be a dull evening.

He didn&#39;t say anything just checked the door he was lounging against 
for any marks or scratches. Grinning as the girl approaching cleared 
her throat, not so much to get his attention but to make sure he 
looked directly at her. 

&quot;A car is a bit much for one date&quot;; the girl stated calmly ignoring 
the confused glance from one of the music teachers that stumbled by 
the practically empty building. 

He didn&#39;t reply, merely chuckling lightly when she dangled the keys in 
front of his face.

&quot;To what do I owe the honor&quot;, the girl asked softly.

&quot;I would like you to do me a favor&quot;, he replied, in that wonderfully 
exotic and deep voice. Sounding of everything that he was lust, 
beauty, temptation and something sinister not to be trifled with. &quot;As 
a reward you get the car&#133;for a day.&quot;

&quot;Why Mr. Chairman you flatter me so. Exactly what kind of favor?&quot;

With a cool and collected gesture he motioned to the back seat of the 
convertible. It was filled with an abundance of roses, all colors, and 
scents. A myriad of elegance and perfection clear in each from stem to 
petal. &quot;I just need someone to deliver these roses.&quot; He paused. He 
knew the girl before him was no fool, unlike so many other students 
she was not taken in by his grace, she was taken by his obvious game, 
seduced by possibility of what she could become if she wanted to. 
After all she practically used the same methods he did in capturing 
prey, though he was far more adult and princely about it. &quot;What do you 
say&#133; Ms. Kaoru?&quot;

She considered for a moment and then with a smile nodded, &quot;I suppose I 
could find the time to run the errand.&quot;

&quot;You do drive don&#39;t you?&quot;

A wicked little smirk spread across her face, &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to 
ask that first? Of course I drive&#133; When do you expect it back?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow&#133; around this same time&quot;, he stated noting the delight in the 
girl&#39;s eyes. Some presents were easier to give than others, and all 
favors came with a price. &quot;Deliver the roses to this address&quot;, he 
pulled a business card out of his shirt pocket handing it lightly to 
the ocean eyed girl who took it with a quick but polite yank. 

She gingerly stepped around to the driver&#39;s side. Opening the door and 
taking her place behind the wheel, trying to ignore the strange 
twinkle in the chairman&#39;s emerald green eyes. She started the car and 
waited for him to remove himself from the passenger door. 

&quot;Be careful out there on the road&quot;, he cautioned sincerely.

She couldn&#39;t help but laugh, &quot;Why do I have feeling I&#39;ve just sold my 
soul to the devil?&quot;

He raised an eyebrow and stepped away from the car, watching with some 
concern as Kozue peeled out of the campus. His cell phone rang just 
then and with his usual cool he answered it, &quot;Hello&#133;Yes she&#39;s on her 
way&#133;&quot; he chuckled then. &quot;Do stay calm I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll find this task 
quite enjoyable&#133; Of course&#133;farewell.&quot; He turned his phone off and 
smiled watching the sun as it began to set, &quot;Little wolf all alone in 
the woods&#133;mind the hunters.&quot;

********************                          

Kozue Kaoru was not a responsible young lady. Anyone with a half a 
brain knew this, and anyone who paid close attention knew that giving 
her free reign with a sports car was just another thing on a long list 
of bad ideas. Now aware of this and aware that the chairman was no 
fool gave the girl reason to pause and consider her options, hundreds 
of which presented themselves the minute the keys were in her 
deliciously cruel little hands. With a bit of regret Kozue decided to 
run the errand first instead of last. Best to get her payment out of 
the way so she could enjoy herself to the fullest. As she drove along 
she checked the business card that had been given to her and noted the 
address. She knew the area and it was a strange place to be delivering 
anything.

Out of the city and bustling town of Ohtori, straight into the wild 
and winding country roads to a place best known for quiet and secluded 
corners one could park a car. Kozue wondered if there was perhaps a 
second favor she would be entailed to do upon her arrival. And the 
very thought made her slightly giddy. How many &#39;favors&#39; had she done 
for teachers and other administrators to get out of trouble? She 
wasn&#39;t sure there was an actual count, but whatever she liked doing 
favors for those almost too afraid to ask&#133;or even those too willing. 
She flipped on the radio and amid the looming trees and sparse night 
sky she found a station that suited her. Music that was heavy and 
precise echoing from the speakers, an atrocity to the normal CDs that 
she noted in the glove box. 

The scent of the roses in the back grabbed at her attention every so 
often and she would slow the car to make sure they were all still 
there. She&#39;d never say she was afraid of the chairman, just cautious. 
No need to have someone like him angry or upset, though she doubted 
there was much that riled his attention. She suspected he hid his 
disappointments with a calming and elegant smile, a kind word and 
pretended forgiveness. One could really only guess what occurred after 
that. Secure that the roses weren&#39;t going anywhere she picked up the 
pace, nearing her goal.

Past the polite parking spots where teens and some adults gathered to 
enjoy some intimate moments was a rickety and deserted looking log 
cabin. Blue eyes noted the light that was on inside slight worry over 
what to expect, slight anticipation that she&#39;d be called upon to 
deliver something more interesting than just roses rising in her 
chest. An animal instinct that kept her safe because she was always 
prepared for what might go wrong. She parked the car as close to the 
cabin as possible edging over to the door and knocking just loud 
enough to be heard. There was no answer.

She searched a bit and finally saw a note swept under the door mat, 
elegant handwriting, curved and seductive gracing the now dust covered 
lavender paper and stating that no one was home, but to please leave 
the goodies on the porch. She arched an eyebrow&#133;goodies? Laughed as 
she brought the roses up and set them on the wooden porch, happy that 
the favor was over and she was free. 

The leather seats were cool against her skin and she tapped her 
fingers in the dashboard deciding on what to do next. It would take 
nearly an hour to reach the city, thirty minutes to find suitable prey 
or at least someone who would appreciate the honor of getting a ride 
in the chairman&#39;s car. Then her eyes caught the wonderful electronic 
toy nestled between the comfortable seats of the car. She&#39;d nearly 
forgotten about the car phone. With a quick rev of the engine she 
started back for town dialing quickly, searching for someone who would 
wait for her, but much to her chagrin no one of use was available. 
Eyes narrowed she sped down the road, taking the curves with careful 
indiscretion. 

Half way down the secluded road, the headlights caught a fairly 
distraught shadow flailing its arms in desperate attempt to catch 
someone&#39;s attention. Kozue slowed the car, wolfish and delighted grin 
crossing her face at the semi-recognizable girl stranded on the side 
of the road. Glancing further down she noted the little run down 
scooter and the front tire that even in the darkness looked blown out. 
The girl happily bounced over to the car a wary expression washing 
over her face upon seeing Kozue as the driver, but it resided into 
jovial thanks after a second or two. The girl was in a few of Kozue&#39;s 
classes; brown hair and doe eyes making her a forgettable face amid 
hundreds that were just like her. The wicked driver&#39;s grin grew just a 
bit more as she recalled that this plain girl&#39;s only outstanding mark 
was the tomboyish pink haired and practically self declared prince of 
the academy she claimed as a friend. A devious thought rolled through 
her mind because all girls secretly craved the attention of a prince, 
to be locked in a fairy tale. Even Kozue, at one point had that need 
to be held and protected by something light, but that was long ago. 
Now she was scaling the walls of darkness, getting herself dirty in a 
futile attempt to show her brother that nothing shines forever. 

&quot;Thanks for stopping&quot;; the girl beamed. &quot;I thought I&#39;d be stuck out 
here forever.&quot;

&quot;No problem&quot;, was the delicate reply. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking why 
exactly are you out alone in the woods?&quot;

The girl giggled nervously, &quot;I sort of got stranded.&quot;

A topaz eyebrow popped up and then settled, &quot;Boyfriend get eaten by a 
bear?&quot;

&quot;Oh no! Nothing like that just silly old me trying to spice up my 
life.&quot;

The obvious question to ask was far too predictable so Kozue let it 
go, reaching over to unlock the passenger side door, questioning why 
she was being kind. Then she realized she wasn&#39;t being all that nice 
as the girl slid into the passenger seat a bit of her skirt slipping 
up her thighs making the wolfish girl wonder how long it would take to 
strip her passenger of her innocence. A ghost of a chuckle left her. 
She was so terrible sometimes but the bright ones&#133;the girls and boys 
who were to plain too be noticed but still lived in a world of total 
optimism and mirth brought out the predator in her. Making her want to 
take the light away, dull the shine and expel something of virtue or 
purity forever proving her point that nothing went untarnished. 

&quot;Anyone you need to call&quot;, Kozue asked lightly, shifting the car and 
then tapping the car phone. 

&quot;Y-you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, she smiled broadly. &quot;It&#39;s not my car anyway.&quot;

Brown eyes were suddenly wide, &quot;You didn&#39;t steal it did you?&quot;

She shook her head; &quot;It was leant to me&#133; as a favor.&quot;

Three hours&#133; that was her estimate time of defeat. She checked the 
time on the clock. It was still relatively early, but there was a 
trick to getting girls. There always was and it was hard to figure 
exactly what lines to use and what moves to make. The plain beauty 
sitting next to her was a feisty one at times. She remembered the 
rumors. The way she bounded up on friends with an excited leap, that 
day she threw water on that dreadful Himemiya girl her brother liked 
so much&#133; she may have been a plain girl, ordinary to a fault but she 
still had a little something that would take some breaking down. She 
glanced over quickly catching the questions in the girl&#39;s big brown 
eyes.

&quot;We should be back in town in about an hour or so&quot;, she affirmed. &quot;Are 
you sure you don&#39;t need to use the phone.&quot;

&quot;Hmm&quot;, the girl perked. &quot;Oh no&#133; I&#39;m fine. No one looking for me 
anyway&quot;, that sounded a bit too regretful.

&quot;Wanting someone to notice.&quot;

The girl frowned a bit, &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Okay&#133;just wondering&quot;, and Kozue turned on some music using one of the 
chairman&#39;s CDs rather than her radio station. 

A nice low and jazzy song filtered through the speakers, a crisp sound 
to mark the feel of the night air. Kozue noted the small shiver from 
her passenger.

&quot;I can stop and put the top up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sound fine.&quot; Kozue smirked and then stated, &quot;I&#39;m Kozue by the 
way.&quot;

&quot;What? Oh!&quot; She blushed a bit. &quot;Wakaba Shinobara. Aren&#39;t you Miki&#39;s 
sister?&quot;

&quot;Always and forever. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of me&quot;, she winked.

Wakaba shook her head and then guiltily added, &quot;Well yeah I&#39;ve heard a 
little.&quot;

&quot;All true&quot;, Kozue proclaimed with a laugh. &quot;Except that one time.&quot;

The girl smiled and looked around the interior of the car recognizing 
it from a few weeks earlier. &quot;Isn&#39;t this&#133;&quot;

&quot;The chairman&#39;s car&quot;, was the interrupting reply. &quot; You&#39;ve been in 
this car before?&quot;

&quot;Just for a quick ride. Like a mini-date.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; 

She got a little defensive, &quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Nothing&#133;sorry. I guess I have habit of pushing peoples buttons&#133;am I 
making you uncomfortable?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; A soft lie, but soft lies led to other denials and denials to 
confessions ultimately. 

*********           

The town came into sight and Wakaba breathed a small sigh of relief. 
Being in the car with Kozue made her nervous and not just because the 
girl liked to speed along winding roads at a death defying pace, or 
ask strange questions&#133;wait&#133;no&#133; the questions just added to the 
discomfort. It was just that, after hearing the rumors the brown-eyed 
girl could see how true it was when people referred to Kozue as a wild 
animal. There was a constant look of hunger in her eyes and whether 
she was intent on slicing someone up with cruel remarks or devouring 
someone in ways Wakaba could barely imagine it was clear that she was 
dangerous. But the thing that got her though, the thing that made her 
worry was that she never thought anyone would look at her the way 
Kozue was as they paused briefly at a stop light. Almost as if the 
notably cruel girl was touching her, though her hands were clearly on 
the steering wheel.

She shivered again and not for the first time Kozue offered to perhaps 
put the top up or run the heater. Wakaba answered in the negative and 
then the young predator asked a question, made a remark that induced a 
rigid and guarded response. The ordinary girl could hardly help it 
though; every word from Kozue&#39;s mouth seemed laced with innuendo and 
probably was. Yes, there was a request just waiting to be asked and 
with the way things were going she wondered if she&#39;d have the 
artillery left to defend herself when it was made.

The car stopped directly in front of Wakaba&#39;s dorm. A smile of thanks 
playing over the girl&#39;s face as she gingerly leapt from the car. 

&quot;Thanks for the ride.&quot;

&quot;No problem&quot;, was a courteous reply. &quot;But next time you feel the need 
to gallivant in the woods make sure you have a reliable vehicle.&quot; 
Inwardly she laughed what a cheesy and overly princely statement. 
&quot;Have a good evening then.&quot;

&quot;Thank you&quot;; and she ran off to her room happy that she managed to 
survive an hour alone with Kozue.

It was an easy give as Kozue had lost the want to play with the girl 
after a short while. It was obviously going to be effort to work in a 
seduction and she really wanted to go out on the town. Show off her 
borrowed car and end the night in a strange bed. It would have been 
nice to have some added fun but she didn&#39;t fret over it. Driving off 
as quickly as she could to capture what was left of the evening. 
Interesting enough the car phone rang before she got very far. Kozue 
wasn&#39;t sure she should answer it but curiosity got the better of her 
and she picked it up.

&quot;Hello, Devil may care.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s impolite to answer other peoples phones&quot;, the deep and gorgeous 
voice on the line stated.

&quot;True&#133; you need something?&quot;

&quot;Enjoying the car?&quot;

&quot;Slightly.&quot;

&quot;Deliver the roses?&quot;

&quot;First thing.&quot;

&quot;Good&#133; there&#39;s a bouquet in the trunk I forgot to mention.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;Could you drop it off for me? They&#39;re expected&#133;. You don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Where are they going?&quot;

&quot;East dorm&#133;if you&#39;re close to the city it shouldn&#39;t be any 
trouble&#133;unless&#133; you&#39;re otherwise occupied.&quot;

Kozue nearly growled. She hated when he especially, seemed to know she 
wasn&#39;t having a productive evening. &quot;No, no problem. Hope they haven&#146;t 
wilted sitting and waiting so long.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find them fresh, Ohtori roses are known for 
their&#133;resilience.&quot;

&quot;Indeed&#133; and which room number are they for?&quot;

&quot;The card is clearly marked. Take care not to stray.&quot;

She laughed as the line went dead. Lessons in excuses she didn&#39;t need; 
he almost sounded as if he wanted her to have &quot;fun&quot;. Made her curious 
who the lucky recipient would be.

***********     

Somehow she hardly felt surprised standing in front of the particular 
door. She ran her fingertips over the nameplate, slight smile playing 
over her lips and then she knocked. The expression that greeted her 
was wonderful, surprise and fear all at once. The girl frowned a bit 
as Kozue handed her the roses, her nervous reaction not calming when 
she noted whom the roses were from.

&quot;Hope you enjoy them&quot;, Kozue almost purred. &quot;They were in the trunk 
and I almost forgot to deliver them.&quot; 

&quot;I-&quot;

She inched her way into the room, a single, with the usual sparse 
settings of the Ohtori dorms, bed, small table, dresser, closet, and 
desk. A pile of cloths here and there, freshly folded and unworn 
formal wear, there was something sad about the room like a million 
invitations that never arrived cluttered the floor, a million first 
kisses never received, and dreams unfulfilled and lonely drifting in 
the air. She was another plain Jane girl desperately waiting to be 
taken, to have that bold romance and something bright. It amused Kozue 
slightly because one day all those imaginary things would start to rot 
and then what? This bright girl would reside herself bitterly to her 
position as someone unnoticed and unworthy. Some stars faded from the 
sky before they could be noticed and named. Kozue wondered if she had 
missed this girl&#39;s attempt to be bright or if she was just in time to 
steal it away. Her want to play came back to her and somehow she knew 
that the privilege of the chairman&#39;s car wouldn&#39;t get her anything 
easier or better. So she resided herself to creating and destroying a 
star, making a memorable moment in a life other wise ordinary.

&quot;Um&#133;Is there anything else&quot;, Wakaba asked with uncertainty catching in 
her tone, not wanting the ocean eyed girl to get too comfortable.

&quot;You must be someone special to receive such a gift&quot;; Kozue motioned 
lightly to the bouquet drooping in the girl&#39;s hands.

Wakaba blushed and then started as a wildly delicate hand graced her 
shoulder. &quot;I&#133;um&#133; not used to getting flowers.&quot;

&quot;Then that makes those extra special&#133; don&#39;t you think?&quot; 

Slowly, she had to move slowly. With her free hand she reached over 
and shut the door brown eyes meeting her blue with a curious but 
familiar gaze, one of uncertainty. A look the innocent were apt to 
give when there was no escaping want. 

&quot;Why are you doing this&quot;, it sounded like defeat but it was a bit more 
resilient than that, more like a challenge. She tried to shrug away 
but was carefully captured into a predatory embrace. &quot;I&#39;m not&#133;&quot; she 
shuddered a bit as a fingers tickled across her neck to bring her gaze 
up, meeting wild blue eyes. &quot;I&#39;m not&#133;&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t&#133;attracted to women&quot;, Kozue asked lightly blocking off escape 
with a word. &quot;Then your pink haired prince is just a friend?&quot;

&quot;No&#133; I mean&#133; I just.&quot; Why couldn&#39;t find the words to argue? &quot;I think 
you should leave.&quot; 

Demanding&#133;that spark of feistiness that made the girl just a little 
more wonderful. The ocean eyed predator sighed and removed herself a 
bit, inserting a few degrees of empty space between her and Wakaba. 

&quot;You may never have another chance like this again&quot;, she whispered 
wickedly. &quot;Your prince&#133;whomever she is&quot;, quickly amending, &quot;Sorry&#133; HE 
is&#133; may never grant your wish.&quot; 

A play of doubt crossed the girl and then she shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t 
care. I don&#39;t want you. Get out!&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; She stepped forward causally reaching for the doorknob 
whispering as she left, &quot;Sad to be so doubled up in love with someone 
too na&iuml;ve to ever notice.&quot;

&quot;How would you know&quot;, she wanted to kick herself for the confession.

Kozue smirked just as she had thought, lies, and denial all waiting to 
be unearthed as a confession. &quot;I think I know better than anyone. You 
really do love her don&#39;t you&#133;that girl who thinks she&#39;s a prince?&quot;

A tiny nod, &quot;Get out of my room Kozue.&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, she ushered herself back into her former position of entrapment. 
Tugging up the girl&#39;s chin to look into her eyes. &quot;You want&#133; I see it. 
You&#39;re trying to hide it but it&#39;s so very evident.&quot; 

She lowered her lips to met Wakaba&#39;s slowly, brushing against them, 
taking them with ease, and even with the girl&#39;s protests and 
resistance managed an excellent taste. She was pushed back fiercely.

&quot;Stop it! Get out! How could you do that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not someone you want to play rough with&quot;, Kozue warned as she 
picked herself up. &quot;Why so angry? Did I bring a moment of disillusion 
to your fantasy? Were you waiting for your fairy tale ending, loves 
first kiss?&quot; She scoffed, &quot;It&#39;s never that romantic. Never&#133;it&#39;s always 
a little pressured, forced, and ultimately animalistic. Who&#39;s the boy 
you&#39;re waiting to sweep you off your feet? Give me a name I bet I can 
tell you exactly what that mystery prince of yours is into.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; She made a move to strike but was blocked, underestimating 
the wicked girl&#39;s strength.

&quot;Rough and tumble&#133;you must want Saonji.&quot; The complete horror in the 
girl&#39;s eyes proved the guess right. A quick and beastly laugh left 
her, &quot;Oh it is&#133; figures&#133; you know what he likes?&quot; She leaned in close 
practically hissing into the other girl&#39;s ear, &quot;He gets off after a 
quick stint of violence. Likes to hit and degrade&#133; and when he 
cums&#133;you&#39;ll love this&#133; He cries out President Kiryu&#39;s name.&quot;

Wakaba started to cry then, using her free hand to try and escape 
Kozue&#39;s vicious grip. But there wasn&#39;t room to escape. So she 
whimpered, &quot;Why are you so cruel?&quot;

&quot;Like asking why the sky is blue or my brother perfect don&#39;t you 
think? Everyone is good at something... I hit buttons&#133;push pulses&#133;tell 
the truth no one wants to hear. Because there is nothing crueler, 
nothing more raw and unbridled.&quot; Her tone dipped a bit softer, &quot;So now 
you know all about your prince&#133;&quot;

Wakaba shook her head and then sank a bit, defeated, &quot;If Utena ever 
finds out-&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll come to your rescue&quot;; Kozue interrupted. &quot;She&#39;ll challenge me 
to duel, play best friend and protector forever and once she&#39;s 
satisfied your honor has been restored&#133;then what? I know what&#133;she&#39;ll 
give you a friendly peck on the cheek and then run off with her 
precious little Himemiya. She&#39;s probably with her princess right now. 
But that&#39;s were she always seems to be these days...and you were her 
best friend weren&#39;t you? Or at least that&#39;s what I heard. Rumors are 
often wrong.&quot; She wrapped an arm around her prey&#39;s waist. &quot;I bet&#133;&quot; 
Felt the girl shudder as she held her close, brown eyes lost in tears 
and what was probably the truth. &quot;Right at this moment&#133; they&#39;re 
together. Tucked up close in bed&#133;&quot; Kozue lowered her lips to the 
girl&#39;s ear continuing, &quot;Holding each other tight&#133; and&#133;&quot; With delicate 
ease she drew her teeth over Wakaba&#39;s ear, eliciting a gasp. &quot;And I 
bet that tomboy is whispering wonderful and loving things into her 
lover&#39;s ear like&#133;&quot; She paused her lips brushing the shorter girl&#39;s 
temple. &quot;I love you.&quot; How she managed to sound sincere was beyond the 
brown-eyed girl&#39;s comprehension. &quot;And&#133; I need you. I want to make you 
feel good.&quot; Kozue caressed the back of the girl&#39;s neck with her hand, 
watching a bit of those stubborn barriers glide away. &quot;Don&#39;t you want 
me to make you feel&#133; feel like you&#39;re loved?&quot;

Doe eyes shut she was weak, she was an ordinary girl, and even after 
the crueler things said that evening, the way Kozue spoke just sounded 
so much like what she always wanted to hear. She nodded whispering a 
yes and an absently muttered, &quot;Utena.&quot;

Her eyes opened slowly, guilt over taking her as she noted that it was 
not Utena that was holding her so closely. She tried to dip her glance 
away but Kozue brought it to meet hers.

&quot;It&#39;s okay&quot;, the cruel girl whispered. &quot;You can pretend. Go ahead&#133; 
call me by her name.&quot; She kissed the top of the girl&#39;s forehead. 
&quot;Close your eyes and say&#133;everything you&#39;ve always wanted.&quot;

There was nothing to fight any longer as brown eyes shut and wild lips 
met hers. A kiss sending little bursts of warmth though out her body, 
gasping as knowing hands slipped up her sides, comforting, caressing, 
and making her trust. A decided and short waltz brought Wakaba over to 
her bed where with the skill of a prince but the hunger of a beast 
Kozue divested the thin articles of clothing that separated them. Each 
garment hitting the floor like a rose petal lost in the wind. A 
wonderfully wicked grin tugged at Kozue&#39;s lips as she dipped her head 
down to trail quick biting kisses down her prey&#39;s neck, pausing at the 
hollow between the girl&#39;s still budding breasts to appreciate the 
noises escaping the girl&#39;s throat. Hand tickling down and around the 
girl&#39;s thigh resting briefly before pushing them apart to gain access 
to the untouched and delicate rose at the center. She removed her 
mouth from the curves of Wakaba&#39;s chest to briefly take the girl&#39;s 
lips, tongue welcome to devour all it encountered.

&quot;Say it&quot;, Kozue whispered pulling away gently, right hand prodding 
below, left teasing at the girl&#39;s nipples with quick tugs, soft 
circular touches. She brought her lips across the girl&#39;s neck biting 
slightly at the jugular. &quot;Say her name. Call me by her name and tell 
me what to do. Come on precious&#133;&quot; her right hand speeding the pace in 
which she took.

And to her delight Wakaba complied, gasping and moaning, begging and 
pleading a prince that was not there.

There was an art to stealing virtue from a star and Kozue was near 
perfect at it. She edged her way down and rested her lips against the 
inside of Wakaba&#39;s right thigh, gliding her tongue up to take and 
taste. Literally purring as the girl&#39;s cries grew louder, lips and 
fingers working to make the moment last as long as possible. And Kozue 
could feel her captive&#39;s light reaching a glow only to crash in a 
final burst of release. 

Wakaba was drifting a bit; weary from her toil, mumbling things Kozue 
knew she was never meant to hear. But the wicked girl was hardly 
finished; she kissed the top of the plain girl&#39;s head, and then her 
cheek eager to teach an important lesson. The girl&#39;s head rested 
comfortably on Kozue&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t your prince be sad to be left unattended&quot;, Kozue whispered 
noting the tension in her prey&#39;s embrace. She tilted the girl&#39;s head 
up smiling cruelly, &quot;You give and you get and when you get you have to 
give.&quot;

Tentatively Wakaba leaned in to kiss the wicked girl who had taken 
her. Kozue smiled as she guided the girl along, a brief growl leaving 
her as she ushered her little star&#39;s head between her legs, fingers 
tangled in her soft brown hair, coaching her on.

&quot;Such a good little girl&quot;, she cooed. &quot;Such a very good little girl.&quot;

******************  

With a deep breath she picked up the last articles of her clothing 
with a broad smile. Blue eyes fixed on the ordinary and faded star 
curled up under the blankets. Dressing quickly and arranging the 
bouquet of roses that through the bustle of the evening ended up on 
the floor on the small table in the center of the room, petals 
delicate, stems perfect, white roses blushed with the slightest of 
pink. She could discuss the way things were going to be with the girl 
at a later time, though she knew she might not even have to. Girls 
were different from boys. Girls wanted forever most of the time and 
she wasn&#39;t equipped to give it. But she would always be around if 
temptation proved too hard to resist.  Before she made her silent exit 
she left the shadow of a kiss on the girl&#39;s cheek. 

The morning air was much cooler than usual and she sniffed before 
starting the car and driving off. As she made her journey the phone 
rang and she frowned as it did. 

&quot;Were the flowers wilted?&quot;

She sneered, some contempt edging in her tone; &quot;No they were as you 
predicted...very resilient. I&#39;m afraid I crushed a few of the blossoms 
though.&quot;

&quot;How very cruel&#133;&quot;

&quot;Yes well&#133; the intended still seemed pleased with the results.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps I should have you do this for me more often.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps&#133;but&#133; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m suited for the job.&quot;

&quot;What a shame&#133; Returning the car early?&quot;

&quot;No&#133; later. I have some things I need to think about.&quot;
