<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;...Himemiya...&quot; Tenjou Utena awoke slowly, crystalline eyes parting 
slightly, one blinded by gauze, the other avoiding the drastic change 
of light. &quot;Wh...where...?&quot; The girl glanced down and saw her nude form 
from her hips on up, her flat stomach swathed in white bandages. 
&quot;...who brought...me here...?&quot; Utena thought to herself. &quot;...I&#146;m not 
dead?&quot; A slender, ivory-white hand came to her face, brushing lightly 
over the gauze patch that was medically taped over her left eye. Her 
seeing eye spotted the IV tube in her wrist, connected to a small bag 
labeled &#145;Blood Type: B&#146; that pumped her life&#146;s fluid into her. &quot;...was 
I... really hurt that badly...?&quot;

&quot;Tenjou-san, you&#146;re awake!&quot; Utena&#146;s thoughts stopped abruptly. 

&quot;...wh...who&#146;s...there?&quot; The Prince&#146;s eye squinted at the silhouette 
in front of her. &quot;...sempai? Arisugawa-sempai? You...brought me here?&quot;

&quot;...yes, yes. I found you in the Kettou Hiroba no Mori . You were 
really hurt badly. Tenjou-san, what happened to you?&quot;

&quot;...I accepted a challenge. Shintaro Keingo...dueled with 
me...and...he was really hard to beat...and...&quot; Arisugawa Juri&#146;s azure 
eyes glanced pitifully at this girl. This injured girl with the glazed 
eye. Is...she crying? &quot;Sempai! I...I lost Himemiya! I don&#146;t know what 
to do anymore!&quot; The broken Prince painfully sat up and began to cry 
openly into her hands. The saltine tears stung the cut over her eye, 
but the pain in her heart stung more. Juri sat upon the girl&#146;s bed, 
gently taking her into her embrace. 

&quot;Shhh...go ahead and cry. I...I know it hurts.&quot; Juri fought to find 
such soft spoken words of comfort, for it wasn&#146;t often that this young 
woman was sought out for help. What else could she say? It certainly 
wasn&#146;t going to be all right. The older woman softly stroked the back 
of Utena&#146;s head, her pink strands silken to her touch. Oh, how she 
felt for this heartbroken child, understanding exactly what it was 
like, for she too, had lost her love to another. &quot;Tenjou-san...I know 
you&#146;re hurting, but you must be strong for her.&quot;

&quot;...de...demo...I can&#146;t protect her like this. 
He&#146;s...probably...hurting her and I&#146;m to weak to duel to get her back. 
What...what&#146;ll I do?&quot; Utena&#146;s crying slowly subsided as she spoke 
sadly. Juri listened intently and unfortunately the young prince was 
right. In her weakened condition, she wouldn&#146;t be able to get Anthy 
back right away. The fencing captain bowed her head and took a deep 
breath.

&quot;Utena-san...I understand what you&#146;re feeling. I, too, felt heartbreak 
like yours and look what happened to me. I&#146;d hate to see such a 
noble-hearted child as yourself become a bitter and unfulfilled person 
as I. With your permission, I&#146;d like to challenge the current Victor 
and take temporary possession of the Bara no Hanayome until you are 
well again.&quot;

&quot;...sempai...you&#146;d...do that for me?&quot; Utena&#146;s eye widened, but 
suddenly relaxed. This wasn&#146;t right. &quot;Arisugawa-sempai...it&#146;s a very 
noble offer, but this is my fight. I&#146;d feel as though I&#146;m being a 
coward if I don&#146;t take her back myself. I wouldn&#146;t feel right.&quot;

&quot;Utena-san, it&#146;s all right, really. You shouldn&#146;t be fighting, you 
should be resting.&quot;

&quot;And I will...rest, but I want to be the one to protect 
Himemiya...like you wanted to do for Shiori, right??&quot;

&quot;Hmm...yes. In that case, I&#146;ll keep an eye on her. It&#146;s the least I 
can do.&quot;

&quot;He&#146;s...obviously abusive. Please, sempai, if he strikes her to your 
knowledge... tell me. I want to protect her no matter what.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; The captain nodded once and turned her head. &quot;Anyway, I have 
to go. I&#146;ll come see you again, tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sempai.&quot; The Prince smiled faintly, running the back of her hand 
over her eye, rubbing away the tear stains.

&quot;Rest now. It&#146;s really late.&quot;

&quot;It is? How long have I been out!?&quot; A sigh escaped Utena&#146;s lips. 
&quot;Damn......&quot; A smile though formed on Juri&#146;s features as she turned to 
walk through the door.

&quot;Oh, and Utena-san...you may want to request some kind of clothing 
article...you look a little...chilly.&quot; Juri chided nonchalantly as she 
motioned to the girl&#146;s nude form.

&quot;Wha!? Wha...what happened to my clothes!?&quot; The Prince blushed 
profusely as she covered her bare front with her bed-sheets, the 
realization of her nudity just hitting her.

&quot;Well, See you later, Utena-san.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Yeah! See you later, sempai.&quot; Utena smiled slightly and laid back 
in her bed, the smile on her face was the first in quite awhile, or 
however long ago she lost her Bride. Countless images of Anthy began 
to cloud the duelist&#146;s head. How was she supposed to get the 
chocolate-skinned goddess back if her opponent constantly breaks the 
rules of the Sekai no Hate? Eventually, however, her weak eyes began 
to close, denoting her exhaustion. &quot;Himemiya...wherever you are...take 
care of yourself...for at the moment I cannot. I&#146;ll free you again, my 
Princess. Just wait for me. I said I would and I will...good night.&quot; 
And then, sleep consumed the prince.

The dueling arena. Upon the sky-high platform, Arisugawa Juri stood, 
poised, ready to fight. The captain&#146;s sword pointing readily at her 
opponent.

&quot;Ah, Arisugawa-san, so good to see you. A challenge of duelists from 
you is quite and honor. What do I owe to it?&quot;

&quot;Spare me the introduction. I&#146;ve come to claim the power of Dios and 
the Rose Bride so that I may return them to their rightful possessor.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;d waste your time fighting for that weakling little 
underclassman? Come now, Juri-san, what is your real reason? You 
needn&#146;t be modest.&quot;

&quot;Drop that cocky attitude and let&#146;s get this started.&quot;

&quot;Of course...I never thought we would.&quot; As Himemiya Anthy placed the 
roses, she stepped back and the duel began. Charging quickly, the two 
slammed their blades together, their only line of separation. The 
reigning Victor swiped his blade off Juri&#146;s and swung at her again, 
the challenger barely avoiding the blow. Himemiya Anthy watched 
expressionlessly, yet confused.

&quot;Why would Arisugawa-sempai fight for me? How did she even know about 
all of this?&quot; Juri&#146;s swift fencing style reflected in her fighting. A 
plus when it came to fighting someone like Shintaro. Her sword slashed 
at the boy, frustration could be seen on his face. Could he have met 
his match with this more duel-experienced woman? He dodged another 
swipe of Juri&#146;s cold blade, but stopped dead as a swarm of rose petals 
blinded his vision. One more petal flew into his gaze and passed as he 
saw the Rose Bride approach.

&quot;The Sekai no Hate have dubbed Arisugawa Juri as the Victor.&quot; The 
words came out emotionlessly, but a hint of relief could be sensed by 
Juri. Shintaro, though, was shocked. His eyes widened in anger in the 
realization of losing just as quickly as he had once won. Juri took 
the Bride&#146;s hand and smiled warmly, not an expression often seen on 
this woman&#146;s face.

&quot;Why, Arisugawa-sama? What was your reason for dueling, today?&quot;

&quot;Anthy...I know well of what occurred in the last duel. I was appalled 
by its outcome.&quot;

&quot;How...Juri-sama?&quot;

&quot;I...stumbled upon Tenjou-san in the Kettou Hiroba no Mori . She 
was...badly injured. I took her to an infirmary and when she woke up, 
she...tearfully...explained what had happened. She was too weak to 
fight right away.&quot;

&quot;Is...she all right, now?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s still resting. I felt so awful for her. That is why I came to 
fight today...to bring you back to her. She really misses you, 
terribly.&quot;

&quot;...Arisugawa...sama...&quot; The Hanayome felt tears on her face as a 
small sob escaped her lips. Juri placed her hand upon Anthy&#146;s 
shoulder, almost startling the now crying girl. The new Victor didn&#146;t 
expect what happened next, though...the tanned girl&#146;s arms wrapped 
around Juri&#146;s neck in a tight, grateful embrace. &quot;Thank you, 
Arisugawa-sama...&quot;

&quot;Oh...of...course. Now, let&#146;s get out of here. Utena-san is waiting to 
see you again.&quot; Anthy nodded and allowed Juri to escort her across the 
arena toward the thresh-hold of swirling stairs. Before crossing, Juri 
looked back once...

&quot;Looking for me, Juri-san!? I won&#146;t be defeated so easily! Draw a deep 
breath sempai, for it&#146;ll be your last!&quot; With that, Shintaro Keingo 
plunged a dagger deep into Juri&#146;s left breast, piercing her heart in 
it&#146;s wake. As true as the statement...Arisugawa Juri drew her final 
breath and collapsed to the ground in a lifeless heap.

&quot;Arisugawa-sama! No!!&quot; The horrified Hanayome screamed, letting the 
cry echo throughout the arena. She screamed it again and again as she 
suddenly bolted upright in her bed. Tenjou Utena breathed hard and 
ragged.

&quot;...no...sem...pai. No...&quot; the injured Prince&#146;s voice fell to a 
breathy whisper. &quot;...a dream...it was only a dream. Kamisama...I&#146;m so 
relieved Juri-sempai listened to me and didn&#146;t fight on my behalf. I&#146;d 
never forgive myself if Shintaro&#146;s cheating got her hurt, too.&quot; With 
another relieved sigh, Utena lied back down. It wouldn&#146;t be long 
before dawn, but the room was still dark and silent, the Prince being 
the only occupant. Her bed was next to a window that she often gazed 
out, mainly because she could see the Observation Tower. 
&quot;Himemiya...you&#146;re over there. I know it. It&#146;s killing me to know that 
I can&#146;t be with you.&quot; Her head dropped to the side and continued to 
stare. &quot;I miss you so much.&quot;

Utena&#146;s one visible eye of azure looked away and gazed suddenly and 
blankly at the numerous bouquets of roses and other such flowers she&#146;d 
received as soon as word of the her hospitalization had gotten around. 
The various colors and scents reminded the young Oji of her love&#146;s 
rose garden, a painful memory actually. The once noble woman now felt 
like a small, lonely child. Each night before was spent talking and 
holding hands with her Princess, but for the first time in a long 
time, Tenjou Utena was alone. A moment of silence later, the 
carnation-haired girl closed her eyes and imagined her Princess&#146; hand 
gently holding her own, Anthy&#146;s fingers feeling like a silken ribbon 
entwining her own.

&quot;Himemiya...we&#146;ll be together again...I promise.&quot; The prince&#146;s hand 
clenched and relaxed several times as she stared blankly at the 
ceiling and thought of the young Bride. Slowly, her other hand was 
brought to her face and her eye gazed thoughtfully at her Rose Signet. 
&quot;What can I do, Oji-sama? How can I get Himemiya back, safely?&quot; She 
dropped her hand and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath and opening 
them again, only now, she stood in a black void with only three 
caskets bearing the Sign of the Rose. She and these caskets were the 
only presence that broke the endless surroundings.

&quot;Where...?&quot; The small, innocent, child-like voice left Utena&#146;s mouth, 
denoting her seven year old youth once again.

&quot;My noble child, what is it that you seek?&quot; A young, gentle voice 
perked Utena&#146;s ears as she turned quickly, her piercing blue eyes 
meeting the comforting sight of her Bara no Oji-sama.

&quot;...Oji-sama...&quot; The small child&#146;s eyes glistened with new tears as 
the Rose Prince kneeled down and opened his arms invitingly. Wasting 
no time, Utena-chan ran to him, burying her face in his chest and 
weeping into it.

&quot;Tiny child...what is it that ails you so?&quot; The Prince&#146;s gloved hands 
wrapped protectively around the child-Utena.

&quot;I&#146;m...so lost. I don&#146;t know what to do, anymore.&quot; She sobbed.

&quot;It&#146;s all right. Talk to me. Tell me what has happened to my noble 
child.&quot;

&quot;I...foolishly...lost, Himemiya in...a duel. I lost her and the power. 
I failed as her Prince. Shintaro was right...I really am a loser.&quot; 
Dios frowned deeply at this. Was this really his Utena, the Utena he 
rescued so many years ago?

&quot;It seems you not only lost that, but you have also lost your noble 
mind and heart. This and all your other losses are tearing you apart, 
but you needn&#146;t worry about the other losses as much as the loss of 
your nobility. Without that, your other emotional wounds will never 
heal, fully.&quot;

&quot;...but...Himemiya means everything to me. What good is possessing my 
nobility if I have nobody to be noble for?&quot;

&quot;Do you doubt yourself, young one?&quot; Utena&#146;s eyes drooped slightly and 
a long pause followed.

&quot;...perhaps I do. This loss has proved my mortality. I don&#146;t want to 
be her failure.&quot; 

&quot;Worry not of failure and think of the well-being of yourself and your 
Bride.&quot;

&quot;But I am...I want her to be free. I want to protect her from the 
Sekai no Hate and help her live a carefree life. I don&#146;t want her to 
be a Bride of the game of Revolution, I want her to be the Princess of 
a Prince.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#146;ve nothing to be afraid of.&quot;

&quot;What about...Shintaro? He&#146;ll cheat again. I know it.&quot;

&quot;You must be strong, Princess. Focus. Defend when necessary, but fight 
back when safe. Blind outrage will prove fatal if it consumes you. Do 
not strive on your opponent&#146;s arrogance and you will not fail.&quot;

&quot;Will...I become the Victor again?&quot;

&quot;That, my child, is for you to decide. Only your nobility will help 
you regain your title. Be strong, my child.&quot; He placed his hands on 
either side of Utena&#146;s cheeks and, like so many, many years ago, 
kissed her tears away. The girl&#146;s eyes opened once more, revealing the 
small sun beams that shone in her window of the infirmary.

&quot;Yes, Oji-sama. I shall be strong.&quot; With a smile, the young prince 
looked out the window at the sunrise that began to envelope the 
spanning campus. Her seeing eye fell upon the Observation Tower, a 
slight feeling of longing sparked inside her, suddenly.

&quot;Himemiya...wait just a little longer. I&#146;ll be healed as soon as I can 
and then I&#146;ll come free you from your hell.&quot;

Shinohara Wakaba waited out the morning for her best friend. There 
wasn&#146;t much time until class and she was getting worried.

&quot;Utena-sama, where are you? You&#146;re unusually late this morning.&quot; The 
small girl frowned and made her way to class. Her mind drifted as she 
walked down the hallways, turned a corner, and then suddenly stopped.

&quot;Himemiya-san...? What&#146;s she doing there without Utena-sama...and with 
that jerk!?&quot; She thought. Wakaba hid around the corner and peeked 
around it, watching the two as quietly as possible.

&quot;Are you rebelling against me!? I said you can&#146;t see her anymore! What 
are you, stupid!?

&quot;I&#146;m not rebelling, but Arisugawa-sempai informed me that she was 
there. I just wanted...to...&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s the problem! You keep wanting! Well, I&#146;ll say it again! No! 
You won&#146;t see her! I forbid it and you know that! Start listening to 
me!&quot; The small, hidden eyes of Wakaba went wide as she saw the older 
boy grasp Anthy&#146;s wrist and slap her down, harshly. Someone who means 
so much to Utena-sama wouldn&#146;t be alone with this boy.

&quot;...something must have happened to Utena-sama.&quot; Wakaba&#146;s chestnut 
colored head lifted confidently as she ran around the corner.

&quot;Hey! Who do you think you are!? Hitting girls!? Do you think that 
makes you a man!?&quot; Wakaba walked over, feeling strangely heroic...just 
like her Utena-sama.

&quot;And who do you think you are eavesdropping on my conversation?&quot;

&quot;Oh...I was looking for Utena-sama. I saw Himemiya-san and thought 
she&#146;d be with her as usual.&quot;

&quot;Whatever would you be looking for her for? Got a date?&quot; Shintaro 
laughed at the small girl who stood in front of him.

&quot;You&#146;re such an arrogant jerk! Where&#146;s Utena-sama!?&quot; Wakaba demanded. 
&quot;You must know if Himemiya-san is with you.&quot; Her face was flushed with 
anger. She looked down at Anthy, who sat on the floor, her face turned 
away, cradling her reddened cheek with a hand.

&quot;Himemiya Anthy is with me because she chooses to be. Tell her Anthy.&quot; 
The Bride&#146;s shoulders dropped and her eyes closed. Her lips parted to 
speak.

&quot;Wait, Himemiya-san. You don&#146;t need to say anything.&quot; Wakaba spoke 
with a familiar nobility that Anthy recognized from her days with 
Utena. &quot;Your expression speaks enough.&quot; Shocked, Anthy looked at the 
small, yet confident girl.

&quot;Shinohara-san...&quot; Wakaba smiled at the grounded girl and offered a 
hand to her. Shintaro slapped Wakaba&#146;s hand away.

&quot;You really are a nosy little girl, Wakaba-san! Why don&#146;t you just go 
to class!&quot;

&quot;No! Not &#145;till you tell me where Utena-sama is! I know you know!&quot; The 
boy smirked fiendishly.

&quot;Fine. But you won&#146;t like it.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up! Just spill it!&quot;

&quot;She chose her fate. Since she foolishly fought with me, she&#146;s lying 
hospitalized. Her pride proved fatal. Now, get lost.&quot; He grabbed 
Anthy&#146;s hand and hoisted her to her feet, dragging her down the 
hallway. Wakaba, though, was outraged.

&quot;You hurt her!! I&#146;ll never, ever, ever forgive you!!&quot; Wakaba grabbed 
Anthy&#146;s other hand, pulled her away, and side stepped the boy. She 
glared at him as her hand rose over her head and swung to him, 
striking him hard in the face. &quot;You&#146;ll be sorry!!&quot; Then, she turned 
and ran away. Keingo stroked his cheek and smiled.

&quot;That girl&#146;s been hanging around Tenjou-kun too long. Shameful.&quot;

Arisugawa Juri was walking the halls of the infirmary; her 
destination: Utena&#146;s room. In her hand, she carried a letter addressed 
to the Prince. 

&quot;Why do I have to deliver this? Breaking more bad news to Utena-san is 
the last thing I need. She&#146;s been slapped around enough.&quot; She sighed 
and turned a corner. The sound of a nurse screaming angrily could be 
heard as Juri noticed a small girl running down the hallway. 
&quot;That...looks like...Shinohara Wakaba?&quot; And Wakaba it was. The girl 
looked as if she&#146;d been running a marathon for hours. 

&quot;Arisugawa-sempai...what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I could say the same for you. Shouldn&#146;t you be in class, 
Shinohara-san?&quot;

&quot;Oh...ye...yeah, sorry, but...I was informed that Utena-sama was hurt. 
I&#146;m just worried is all. I didn&#146;t mean to cut class.&quot; Wakaba placed 
her hands together in front of her chest and mentally pleaded to let 
this be dismissed.

&quot;I see. That&#146;s understandable.&quot;

&quot;It is? I mean...oh.&quot;

&quot;As a matter of fact, I&#146;ve come to see her, too.&quot;

&quot;Do you know what happened to her?&quot;

&quot;Ah...well...she...would be better off telling you herself.&quot; Wakaba 
nodded and then followed the fencing captain down the hallway. A small 
sigh of relief escaped Juri&#146;s lips. She couldn&#146;t possibly be the one 
to reveal Utena&#146;s dueling life to this girl. 

Tenjou Utena stood up slowly, yet determined. She&#146;s been off her feet 
for a few days now and the isolation was driving her insane. She 
hobbled over to the closet and fished around inside, searching for her 
clothes. 

&quot;Where the hell did they put my clothes? I gotta get outta here.&quot; The 
Prince scowled at the various empty coat-hangers. She opened a drawer 
and smiled. &quot;Ah...finally.&quot; She pulled out her red shorts that looked 
as though they&#146;d been cleaned. Her eyebrow twitched as she brought the 
shorts to her nose and inhaled...fabric softener. 

&quot;Good...they&#146;ve been cleaned.&quot; She carefully slid her legs into them 
and pulled them around her waist, carefully adjusting them to avoid 
contact with her stitches. &quot;Damn, stupid wound. That better not leave 
a real noticeable mark.&quot; Next, she pulled out her trademark 
form-fitting tank-top. Easily enough, she took the hospital gown off 
and she put the top on. &quot;Now for my jacket.&quot; Once more, she looked in 
the drawers for it...but came up empty. &quot;Wha!? Where&#146;s my jacket!?&quot; 
Utena&#146;s pink tresses followed suit as she snapped her head around and 
scanned the room for her favorite article of clothing. It wasn&#146;t in 
her closet, in the drawers, on the floor, nowhere...where could it 
be??? Defeated, she turned and kicked the closet door shut, then was 
blinded. &quot;Wha...!?&quot; She grabbed the source of darkness and 
looked...pleased. &quot;Why the hell did those people put it up there? And 
I thought I was lazy.&quot; The Prince held the jacket up in front of 
her...and frowned. The hole where Shintaro&#146;s sword cut into it went 
all the way across the trademark uniform. &quot;Damn him.&quot; Of all the 
things she owned that had to be ruined, it had to be her jacket, aside 
from her happiness. Utena put the totaled coat back in the closet and 
closed it. &quot;So...now what do I do?&quot; Her blue eye looked thoughtfully 
around the room and saw, well, nothing. &quot;How boring. There&#146;s nothing 
to do, nothing to read, no one to talk to. This really sucks.&quot; With a 
shrug, the girl turned and placed a hand on her knee, then stretched. 
&quot;Ah...one, two, three, four. Switch. One, two, three...&quot; A sigh 
escaped her lips each time she pushed. The stitches in her stomach 
made it difficult, but this was no time to worry about such things, 
after all, she did have a duel to get prepared for. The Prince strode 
across the room and leaned on the wall, sliding down it, and kicking 
her feet in the air. Handstand...naturally, followed by the opening of 
the door.

&quot;Good morning, Utena-san. How are...you?&quot; Juri&#146;s face faltered at the 
sight before her. &quot;What are you doing!?&quot; 

&quot;Ah! Good morning, sempai! I&#146;m just trying to get a little physical 
activity. I&#146;m bored.&quot;

&quot;You should be resting. You&#146;re going to...&quot; Juri suddenly got cut off 
and was silenced.

&quot;What? Sempai?&quot; Utena looked to Juri...and saw Wakaba.

&quot;Utena-sama!! Oh! Are you all right!?!? I heard you were hurt!! I was 
so worried!&quot; Below Wakaba, Juri placed her head in her hand and 
sighed. 

&quot;Shinohara-san, would you kindly get off me?&quot;

&quot;Ah! Sorry, sorry, sorry!&quot; The fencing captain rose to her feet and 
brushed off her uniform, then scowled at the girl. 

&quot;Don&#146;t mind her, sempai. She&#146;s just being Wakaba. She wouldn&#146;t be 
Wakaba without the power to &#145;glomp&#146; anything that stands in her way.&quot; 
With a small grin, the prince tipped and stood right-side-up. 

&quot;Hmph! See if I ever worry about you again! You&#146;re mean!!&quot; Wakaba 
stuck her small tongue out at her best friend and stuck her nose in 
the air.

&quot;Awww, c&#146;mon. You know I was kidding. I kid you all the time!&quot; Utena&#146;s 
slender hand reached out and playfully tugged on her smaller friend&#146;s 
ponytail.

&quot;Welllllll....okay!&quot; Utena quickly jumped back...avoiding a 
threatening glomp.

&quot;Nuh uh uhhhh...no &#145;glomping&#146; until Utena-san&#146;s well again.&quot; Juri 
placed her arms around Wakaba&#146;s midsection and pulled back.

&quot;Oh! Oh yeah. I forgot.&quot; The now cheerful girl seated herself in an 
easy chair and swung her legs back and forth. Across the room, Juri 
shook her head, marigold curls bouncing to-and-fro with her movements.

&quot;Anyway, Tenjou-san, I was told to deliver this to you. It&#146;s from the 
Seitokai.&quot;

&quot;The Seitokai? What do they want with me? I&#146;m not the Victor, 
currently, so what&#146;s the deal?&quot;

&quot;I...suggest you read the letter.&quot; Juri looked to Utena and nodded 
once. The Oji&#146;s shoulders shrugged as she tore into the envelope and 
pulled from it, a letter addressed to her, formally. It read:

Tenjou Utena-san:

It has come to our attention that you have been forced to surrender 
your title of Kettou no Shioushia to, one, Shintaro Keingo. With a the 
loss of the title comes the loss of other things. We regret to inform 
you that, due to your hospitalization, we were forced to move your 
belongings to another location to make room for the new Kettou no 
Shioushia, instead of you moving them yourself. Your new dorm room is 
now located in the west wing of the Ohtori Gakuen campus, room 438. It 
is a single dorm. 

Should you decide to regain your title, you know what to do. Until 
then, your location is noted above. We suggest you accept these 
changes without question and spend your time concentrating on getting 
well. Take care of yourself, Tenjou-san.

Ohtori Gakuen Seitokaichou,

Kiryuu Touga

Utena&#146;s eyes hardened, but regained composure. Lowering the letter, 
she looked up to Juri, her seeing eye almost appeared sad.

&quot;I&#146;ve...been...relocated.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, Utena-san. That&#146;s one disadvantage to being in the 
Seitokai. I don&#146;t like making such regretful decisions.&quot;

&quot;I understand, sempai.&quot; A deafening silence filled the room. Utena&#146;s 
eye glanced every so often at Juri, then back at her note. Juri looked 
out the window, then back at Utena. The prince lifted a hand up and 
rubbed the back of her neck, eye moving back and forth, uncomfortably. 
No sound emanated, whatsoever, except for Wakaba&#146;s snoring.

&quot;Is she...asleep?&quot; Juri looked at the girl in the easy chair and 
laughed softly.

&quot;She does it sometimes...don&#146;t mind her.&quot; The captain nodded and 
looked back to the prince.

&quot;Off the subject, how do you feel?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, a little better. My stomach feels okay except when I move 
abruptly.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s good.&quot; Juri looked to the girl in front of her and smiled 
slightly. &quot;Oh, what about...your eye? He didn&#146;t...cut into it, did 
he?&quot; 

&quot;Ah...I don&#146;t think so. I&#146;ve had this patch on since I first woke up 
here.&quot;

&quot;Well, the doctor told me the night I brought you in that you should 
be fine.&quot; Arisugawa Juri approached Utena, placing her hand on the 
girl&#146;s face and lightly brushing her thumb over the patch. 

&quot;Should...I check?&quot;

&quot;No pressure, Utena-san. Do it when you want to.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; The Prince walked to the closet and placed the letter 
in the pocket of her jacket. She looked down at the jacket and brushed 
her fingers over the hole that had been cut in it, a pained expression 
on her face.

&quot;Utena-san...? What&#146;s wrong?&quot; Juri&#146;s soft voice caught the attention 
of the azure-eyed Utena. Slowly, she turned and looked to the captain, 
shaking her head.

&quot;It&#146;s nothing...I just...I don&#146;t know. This whole ordeal has 
really...been hard. I dreamed of my Prince last night and he told me 
to be strong, but I&#146;m...just afraid I can&#146;t. I see this slit in my 
jacket and think...if I had been foolish enough, I could have been 
hurt even worse than I am.&quot;

&quot;But you weren&#146;t. You&#146;ll be all right, Utena-san. Your &#145;prince&#146; you 
see all the time, do you do everything he says?&quot;

&quot;Of course. He&#146;s...my Prince. Why wouldn&#146;t I? I don&#146;t know where I&#146;d 
be without his guidance sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Utena-san...you&#146;re very fortunate, then. I see he&#146;s been there for 
you quite a bit.&quot;

&quot;Yes...he has.&quot;

&quot;See, Utena-san? That&#146;s all you have to do.&quot; The Prince&#146;s eye looked 
to Juri weakly.

&quot;I don&#146;t understand what you&#146;re saying.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m saying...that he&#146;s your Prince. If he is, then he&#146;s always there 
for you.&quot; The pink-headed duelist nodded once, but still felt 
confused. What on Earth was this getting to?

&quot;Tenjou Utena...to be a Prince, you must protect a Princess. Himemiya 
Anthy is your Princess...so be her Prince.&quot; Juri took Utena&#146;s hand and 
looked at her sternly, yet kindly, like a mother to her daughter. &quot;The 
Prince in Dios protects you, his Princess. The Prince in you protects 
Anthy, your Princess.&quot; 

&quot;You...you&#146;re right. I am Himemiya&#146;s Prince.&quot;

&quot;So just get back on your feet and regain your strength...then rescue 
Anthy.&quot; Utena&#146;s lips slowly curled into a smile and she turned to look 
at her sempai. The duelist couldn&#146;t help but feel a little 
overwhelmed, considering that it&#146;s not often that comforting words, 
such as the ones that had been spoken, would come from Arisugawa Juri. 

&quot;Thanks, sempai.&quot; Juri, too, felt a little overwhelmed. Had she really 
been the one to help Utena? 

&quot;Utena-san...get a little more rest. I&#146;ll...see if I can get you out 
tonight, okay?&quot; 

&quot;Are you serious!?&quot; An enthusiastic smile dramatically changed Utena&#146;s 
features as she threw her arms around the fencing captain and held her 
tightly. &quot;Oh, you don&#146;t know how good it feels to hold someone again.&quot;

&quot;Ah...I&#146;m glad...anyway I really should be going.&quot; Arisugawa Juri felt 
a burning sensation emanate in her cheeks as she felt the 
underclassman hold her around the waist. What the hell was she 
doing??? This girl was in love with another!! The upperclassman peeled 
the girl off her and bid her good day until later. &quot;Hey, 
Shinohara-san...wake up. You&#146;re going to class, now.&quot; Juri shook the 
slumbering Wakaba, waking her with difficulty.

&quot;I don&#146;t wanna...just five more minutes...pleeeeease?&quot; 

&quot;Um...no, sorry, Shinohara-san. It&#146;s time for class.&quot;

&quot;Mouuuuu...yeah yeah.&quot; The chestnut-headed girl stood and stretched. 
&quot;Utena-sama, sorry. I didn&#146;t mean to fall asleep.&quot;

&quot;Ah, it&#146;s okay. Arisugawa-sempai is going to try and get me out this 
evening. It seems, also, that I&#146;ve been relocated. Why don&#146;t you come 
to my new dorm after school, tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you aren&#146;t coming to school even though you&#146;ll be out?&quot;

&quot;I need to unpack and finish my late work.&quot; Utena&#146;s head dropped with 
disgust.

&quot;What&#146;d they relocate you for, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Um...because...they just wanted to. They switched Shintaro Keingo&#146;s 
room with mine for some reason. No big deal. I&#146;ll get it worked out, 
eventually.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...well...okay. which room?&quot;

&quot;Ahh...west wiiiiinnnng...um...43...8? Yeah, 438.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, that&#146;s way out there.&quot; Wakaba thought. &quot;Well, okay!! I&#146;ll see 
you later, Utena-samaaaa!&quot; Wakaba covered her curiosity with a hyper 
departure, Juri following.

&quot;Ah, yeah, I&#146;ll see you later...&quot; The prince waited until Juri and 
Wakaba had left before walking over to the sink and staring at her 
reflection. She looked tired and pillow-faced. &quot;A mirror reflects ones 
image...some individuals learn to change from viewing their 
reflection...can I do that?&quot; The previous Victor of the Duel brushed 
her fingers lightly over her eye patch and let two fingertips clench 
the corner of the medical tape. &quot;I guess it&#146;s time to make a change.&quot; 
Slowly, Utena pulled the adhesive bond and looked away as the patch 
was dropped into the sink. The girl was hesitant to look for she had 
seen all the blood which had been absorbed into the gauze. Was it that 
bad? No way, it couldn&#146;t be. Tenjou Utena took a breath and clenched 
her eyes shut as her carnation-locked head lifted, 
waiting...waiting...waiting...and her eyes opened. Silence. Deafening 
silence. The prince looked at her face, her mouth moving wordlessly 
until her hand covered it, silencing the silence. There it was, her 
change. No, Tenjou Utena was not blinded at all, but may as well have 
been. Around her beautiful, crystalline-azure eye, was a blade scar. 
One the prince knew wouldn&#146;t go away. Her reminder of her foolishness. 
Her blind outrage. Her loss of love. The boy whom Utena dubbed the 
&quot;Son of Lucifer&quot; had physically scarred her...for life...he&#146;d 
humiliated her...he&#146;d stolen her lover and best friend...he&#146;d 
practically taken away everything in which Utena held dear. &quot;I will 
never forgive him. If Himemiya sees this...she&#146;ll...I know how she is! 
She&#146;ll forever blame herself! I can&#146;t live with that and she won&#146;t 
listen to me when I say it&#146;s not her fault! Dammit!&quot; The prince 
gritted her teeth and clenched a hand, quickly releasing a breath 
before throwing her tight fist into the mirror, shattering it. 
&quot;There...I&#146;ve made a change. A decision.&quot; She pulled her hand away 
from the razor-sharp shards of the mirror and wiped the blood on her 
shorts. &quot;I&#146;m sorry, Himemiya. I can&#146;t let you live in guilt. I only 
now realize that I can never change you. If I could...you&#146;d have been 
free a long time ago.&quot; Utena thought about the many attempts she made 
to give her love a life...and those attempts&#146; results. &quot;Hmph...Bara no 
Hanayome. Your fate has probably forced you to forget about me. To 
hell with fate. I&#146;ll start over if I have to.&quot; Tenjou Utena sat on her 
bed and rested her head in her hands, blood running from the glass 
incisions. Once more, she looked to her bloodied fist, glancing 
briefly at her Rose Signet. &quot;Oji-sama...&quot; Many minutes passed by with 
the young girl looking at her ring. A sad, defeated sigh escaped her 
pastel lips as she slipped the ring off her finger, stood up, and 
walked to the closet, depositing the finger-less ring in her coat, out 
of sight... out of mind. &quot;Forgive me...Himemiya.&quot; A moment later, Juri 
came in.
