<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 13 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Not hearing the stairway door open or close they stood there 
together, the night&#39;s breeze flowing over them both. Utena drew back a 
bit from Juri&#39;s warm arms, the pink haired, slim vampire&#39;s breath 
coming just a bit faster.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Utena murmured softly.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Juri honestly answered, her hands gently 
resting on the shorter woman&#39;s upper arms, the tall, busty orange 
haired woman stroking the covered flesh lightly. Those striking blue 
eyes looked away from her, and Juri wondered if she was going to be 
turned away again, just moments away from reaching paradise.

        &quot;I can&#39;t lie to her,&quot; Utena looked up to meet Juri&#39;s dark 
eyes, feeling that warmly compassionate gaze on her, &quot;I have to tell 
Anthy.&quot;

        Juri nodded, obviously not too surprised. &quot;But tell her what?&quot; 
she asked softly. Juri needed to hear it, needed to have Utena say 
those words.

        &quot;That I..&quot; she hesitated, then Utena continued on more firmly, 
&quot;want to be with you, Juri.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Juri&#39;s smile was suddenly wicked as she pressed her 
lips to Utena&#39;s in a hungry kiss. A tongue gently probed, and Utena&#39;s 
lips yielded to the intrusion.

        Their lips parted, and Utena had to gasp softly as that hot, 
wet mouth traced along her jaw, a teasing tongue flick to the flesh of 
her neck. Juri&#39;s hands tugged at the boy&#39;s jacket and Utena helped 
her, shrugging off the black garment so that it fell to the roof.

        Juri paused, smiling slightly at the tight black T-shirt that 
Utena wore beneath it. The generous curves of her breasts rose up 
against the dark material, the delicate sweep of her pale neck brought 
into stark relief. She cupped the warm flesh, finding nipples hard 
under the cloth, and bent down to kiss them through the dark fabric.

        &quot;God,&quot; Utena gasped, &quot;don&#39;t tease!&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s only fair,&quot; Juri chuckled softly, &quot;you&#39;ve been teasing 
me for weeks.&quot;

        Juri grasped the hem of her love&#39;s shirt, helping Utena pull 
the T- shirt off and flinging it aside. Round, pale breasts, the 
nipples a darker pink against the white. A raspy, catlike tongue 
caused Utena to cry out softly, her pale arms wrapping around Juri&#39;s 
head. Juri brought her lips around, a gentle nursing on the breasts 
bringing sweet moans and whimpers from her lover.

        Utena felt herself being guided onto her back and surrendered 
gratefully. With the girls who served her, with Anthy, and in her life 
Utena had been in charge, in command. She had pleasured her girls, 
bringing them to the heights of passion, but never receiving herself. 
And Anthy, sweet, kind Anthy who had no idea what was going on inside 
of her. As Juri began to undo the black pants Utena sighed happily, 
letting someone else be in charge at last.

        A bit of wiggling brought the pants off, revealing white 
cotton underwear. Juri slid her body up, kissing Utena again as she 
began to stroke along the thin, damp cloth. Utena gasped, her slim 
fingers digging into Juri&#39;s shoulders, shuddering under Juri&#39;s gentle 
touch. Juri took her time sliding back down Utena&#39;s body, tongue 
teasing and lips kissing that pale, soft skin.

        It took a few tugs to get the panties away, the fluids 
sticking to them. The pink triangle of hair, the sweet scent nearly 
made Juri swoon. Soft, teasing kisses, tracing down to find the source 
of the wetness. The lips gently parted, a gush of fluid...

        &quot;Ah!&quot; Utena cried out, body twisting beneath Juri&#39;s expert 
touch.

        They lay there together, Utena stretched out beside Juri on 
the rough material. Juri cradled the smaller woman close, softly 
murmuring, &quot;Next time, you get to lead.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena sighed happily.

        In the apartment just below them Shiori seemed to stiffen 
slightly, her eyes widening in surprise. Ruka looked up from where the 
blue haired man was working at cleaning up the kitchen, &quot;Is there 
something wrong?&quot;

        &quot;I have a link to Utena,&quot; Shiori murmured to herself softly, 
the purple haired girl shivering slightly in pleasure, &quot;I just got a 
sudden feeling of utter happiness from her.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe that&#39;s where Anthy went?&quot; Wakaba speculated, the brown 
haired young girl washing the dishes briskly. Letting any of the 
vampires help wash them usually seemed to cause at least one of the 
plates to get broken. It wasn&#39;t too bad the first few times, but 
having it happen regularly tended to deplete the dishes pretty fast.

        &quot;No,&quot; Ruka shook his head, &quot;I saw Anthy leave the building.&quot;

        &quot;Didn&#39;t Juri leave with Utena?&quot; Wakaba asked cheerfully.

        Shiori&#39;s eyes widened slightly at that, then narrowed.

        &quot;Shit,&quot; Ruka cursed softly.

        &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Shiori turned, swiftly leaving the room. Entering 
into the bedroom she had shared with Juri she broke into a feral grin. 
&#39;I&#39;m free, free at last!&#39; she thought to herself happily. Closing her 
eyes Shiori walked over to the window, her thoughts reaching out to 
another.

        The tall, blue haired woman stood in the darkness of the 
apartment, drinking deep of the young woman she cradled gently in her 
arms. Suicidal already, the child&#39;s need for oblivion had called out 
to her, much like it could have called any elder vampire. Full, she 
loosened her grip, letting the empty body slide to the floor.

        Mrs. Ohtori looked up feeling the call, the familiar touch of 
that mind. &quot;Shiori,&quot; she actually smiled slightly, the purple haired 
child&#39;s image appearing before her.

        &quot;Mistress,&quot; Shiori smiled back, eyes twinkling.

        &quot;You have something to report?&quot; Mrs. Ohtori asked. It was 
strange, but seeing the girl felt so good. Like she had missed her 
presence, somehow.

        &quot;Juri and Utena seem to have embarked on an affair,&quot; Shiori 
reported softly, warming under her mistress&#39; gaze. It hadn&#39;t been 
until she left Mrs. Ohtori&#39;s side that she realized how deep that 
mastery went, how much she wanted to make her pale queen happy.

        &quot;Then Juri is a fool,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori found herself saying, &quot;to 
neglect one such as you.&quot;

        Shiori&#39;s cheeks colored and she had to look away from her 
shyly. &quot;Thank you, Mistress,&quot; she whispered happily. She looked up to 
add, &quot;Utena intends to hold a great party tomorrow, at a place called 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

        &#39;Why did I say that to her?&#39; Mrs. Ohtori wondered, then shook 
her head. &quot;I know of that place, it&#39;s considered neutral territory,&quot; 
she said crisply. She hesitated before asking, &quot;Do you wish to remain 
among them, Shiori?&quot;

        &quot;No, Mistress,&quot; Shiori said softly, her eyes wide in hope.

        Mrs. Ohtori nodded firmly, &quot;Then at the party tomorrow night, 
I will come to reclaim you, my little one. Be ready.&quot;

        &quot;Mistress,&quot; Shiori beamed happily, &quot;thank you!&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Mrs Ohtori smiled as the link faded, &quot;thank you.&quot; And a 
few moments later, both women found themselves alone once again.

        Out in the night Anthy paused on her way home, an odd tickling 
sensation at the back of the dark purple haired vampiress&#39; neck, 
feeling sure she was being followed. She turned around, looking into 
the shadows to find her persuer, but there was nothing but shadows and 
darkness.

        &quot;I must be edgy,&quot; Anthy muttered, going inside the apartment 
building. She nodded to the doorman, stepping into the elevator and 
rising the many levels to Utena&#39;s floor. The halls were quiet as she 
walked to the door, hesitating before she opened it.

        &#39;Will Utena be back here?&#39; Anthy wondered. She felt a pang 
considering leaving the beautiful pink haired girl, but she knew there 
was no other way. If she didn&#39;t love her, then there was no reason to 
stay here any longer.

        &quot;Anthy,&quot; Wakaba said with forced cheerfulness as she walked 
inside.

        Anthy scanned the room, her nose swiftly picking up the scents 
in the suite. Wakaba and Ruka, Shiori in the other room, the groupies 
sleeping over there, and that was all. &quot;Where&#39;s Utena?&quot; she asked them 
briskly.

        &quot;She hasn&#39;t been back yet,&quot; Ruka said a bit apologetically.

        Muscles in Anthy&#39;s jaw jumped as she clenched it. &#39;Utena&#39;s 
still up on the roof with Juri,&#39; she thought, feeling a surprising 
surge of anger.

        Shiori walked out of her and Juri&#39;s bedroom, an oddly content 
smile on her face. &quot;Oh, hello Anthy,&quot; she beamed, &quot;you&#39;re back.&quot;

        &quot;Do you know what Juri and Utena are doing?&quot; Anthy growled 
softly.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Shiori actually smiled at her winsomely, &quot;Juri 
and I have always had an open relationship.&quot;

        Anthy clenched her hands, looking ready to break something. 
Anything would do. &quot;Well,&quot; she snarled, &quot;Utena and I don&#39;t!&quot;

        With that Anthy left, slamming the door behind her.

        &quot;Utena is in so much trouble,&quot; Wakaba sighed.

        Just in front of the building a figure emerged from the 
darkness, gazing up at the apartment building thoughtfully. At first 
glance she might be taken for a teenager, but a closer look into her 
eyes showed a greater age, an ancient burden.

        &quot;She almost spotted me,&quot; Saya murmured, &quot;I&#39;s best not 
underestimate them.&quot; Carrying her sword case over her shoulder she 
moved off, adding with a grim smile, &quot;Looks like the whole nest is 
here, just waiting to be dealt with when I&#39;m ready.&quot;
