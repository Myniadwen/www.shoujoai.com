<a href="../utena/norock-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The End Of Everything

Whirling and screaming they came, a horde of over a thousand people, all 
torn and cut and bleeding from traveling on foot for several hundred 
miles. All to reach their final destination. Men women and children of 
varying ages came, wearing dirty soiled clothing and all with the same 
mindless wild look. They ran at a speed faster than human as they were 
pursued by police sirens and the flashing lights of emergency vehicles. 
Far behind them them the city was in chaos; shops on fire and the 
streets littered with broken glass at their passing. Cops continuously 
yelled into their radios that &#39;Yes! There&#39;s a mob breaking out of the 
city limits!&#39; and &#39;No I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going! They all just 
came running out of that damn concert!&#39;. As news reporters followed the 
action from a safe distance in their vans, one being followed their dark 
progress far more closely...

The One was gazing out into the distance with ageless eyes, borrowing 
the sight from a variety of the weaker blades as it guided them silently 
onward. Soon...they would be reaching the school gates soon... Shaking 
itself out of its trance, the One looked over at its two remaining 
Swords and gave a silent nod to their unspoken questions.

&quot;They&#39;ll be here within moments. Stupid though they may be in comparison 
to such as we, the Thousand Swords will serve to effectively bolster our 
ranks.&quot;

The Sword representing Hatred of Authority sneered dismissively as it 
stared out through Jak&#39;s eyes. &quot;Whatever. I don&#39;t even care anymore. Why 
must we wait for them when we already have what we wanted? It&#39;s stupid!&quot; 
He stabbed a finger down at the weakly thrashing body pinned to the 
concrete beside them. Anthy stared up with glazed eyes, her blood 
pumping out around the sharp swords jammed though her arms and legs. The 
dirty gag tied around her mouth kept her from crying out.

The Sword within Jak stalked around her body; predatory in the way its 
eyes never left her. &quot;I don&#39;t care about this foolishness anymore...not 
when she&#39;s right here waiting for me to finally kill her. I don&#39;t see 
why we have to listen to you any-&quot; But his words were strangled as the 
One&#39;s hand suddenly closed around his throat; having moved faster than 
sight from where she had been standing on the other side of the roof. 
The toes of his boots barely scraped the ground as he struggled in the 
smaller woman&#39;s grip.

&quot;Never forget, sibling...that while your strength comes from your hatred 
at all power held over you, you do not have the strength to disobey that 
power.&quot; Her words were calm, each one falling like a stone. Jak&#39;s eyes 
glared hatefully back at her, as she slowly crushed his windpipe. But at 
last he gave a small nod and cast his eyes down. With a jerk she tossed 
him back, where he landed on his feet a few staggering paces backward.

&quot;Whatever. Just make it soon, ok?&quot; But his grumbling was more of a 
petulant whine now.

The third Sword on the rooftop still remained motionless, watching the 
duelists gathered in the courtyard below. Her short hair waved about her 
face in the ethereal winds coming off of the vortex of light, which spun 
directly above them. The transparent shapes of swords spun in a chain, 
snake-like as they twisted in and around the tornado that centered them 
in the air directly above Anthy&#39;s heart. But they never came close to 
her, nor the other rooftop occupants. Several feet of air formed a very 
thin barrier of safety. But when the time was right, that too would 
disappear.

The sword within Violet gazed out into the darkness; seeming to be 
watching nothing at all. But in actuality, she saw everything. Her face 
was walled off as the One slithered over and draped an arm around her 
body. Violet didn&#39;t react as the leading Sword pulled her close, not 
even so much as flinching or smiling when a taunting kiss was placed 
upon her cheek.

&quot;Still sulking? Really now...I should think you&#39;d be happy with your new 
body. But I suppose you never really change.&quot; Utena&#39;s face broke into an 
evil smile, one that reminded Anthy strongly of Akio in the old days. 
She narrowed her green eyes as anger boiled up from her breast at what 
these monsters had done to her beloved.

Violet continued to remain motionless, but her eyes slowly shifted to 
their corners to gaze back at Utena&#39;s own. She said nothing, but the air 
seemed to grow steadily heavier. The One continued gazing back, still 
sporting her sardonic grin, but her eyes narrowed. There were a few 
moments of silence. Then, without turning she called to Jak.

&quot;Have the sniveling humans worked up the courage to come up to meet us 
yet? I too grow tired of waiting.&quot;

Jak finally wrenched his silver eyes from where they had been raking 
over Anthy&#39;s body, long enough to move to the roof&#39;s edge and gaze down 
below.

&quot;Not yet. But they stand ready. I smell blood from here...&quot; He smirked, 
his nostrils flaring as he took a deep inhalation.

Anthy closed her eyes and bravely ignored the aching pain in her body, 
from the beating earlier when they had captured her. She was weakening 
with every second, yet she steeled herself. She had dealt with 
excruciating pain before, and nothing could truly match the pain of 
being stabbed continuously by the million swords day after day....hour 
after hour. This pain meant nothing. She refused to yield to the little 
monsters. But the taunt about the duelists below made her chest tighten 
in apprehension.

She could deal with pain...and was willing to bite her own tongue out if 
it meant foiling whatever plans that main Sword had. Yet if something 
were to happen to those wonderfully noble men and women who had risked 
so much to help her...who had all grown up and gotten lives of their 
own, yet dropped everything to try and help her rescue Utena...

People who actually cared about her, it would seem...

She didn&#39;t know what she would do. And the thought made the bottom of 
her stomach sickeningly drop out. Dying was easy for her, but losing the 
ones she had come to deeply love...

For the first time since Anthy Himemiya could remember, she closed her 
eyes tightly and began to pray.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The duelists were standing outside of the East Dorms, a line of 
silhouettes that were staring up into a boiling black sky. But more 
specifically: at the pillar of light that pierced it dangerously. They 
spoke not a word as they checked their weapons, adjusted shirt collars, 
removed jackets, and took that last long lingering kiss before they 
prepared for the worst. There was a heavy foreboding that weighed upon 
each of them.

Nanami and Kozue were off to one side, not quite looking at each other. 
And while the other duelists discussed plans of attack and how to begin 
the assault, Kozue bit her bottom lip as she mulled on thoughts of her 
own. Finally she looked up and came over to Nanami&#39;s side. Her empty 
lighter kept flicking open and closed nervously at her side.

&quot;Hey, ah...listen...&quot;

&quot;Save it Kozue.&quot;

Kozue refused to let the sullen tone stop her. She&#39;d had this on her 
mind for awhile now, despite her flippant remarks to Touga earlier. But 
the lack of honorific on her name wasn&#39;t lost on her.

&quot;About what happened in the green house, I didn&#39;t-&quot;

Nanami cut her off with a sharp dismissive wave. &quot;It&#39;s fine, Kozue. You 
did what you had to do, and now I&#39;m freed. I&#39;m grateful. Really.&quot; The 
blond, who now had several cuts and bruises showing on her face, gave 
her a baleful look. But she sounded tired more than anything. &quot;You 
risked your life...you didn&#39;t have to. But I appreciate it. I never want 
to have another one of those...those things inside me again.&quot; She 
whispered tersely. Kozue regarded her silently.

Over the years, Nanami had matured a great deal. But most of it not 
through any desire of her own. She was handed the reins of her father&#39;s 
company after a merger and a scandalous media event broke out involving 
her brother Touga. It had forced her to step up to the plate and be the 
grown up she never was in school. Nanami had immediately gone under fire 
from bureaucrats and administrators, criticizing her age, sex, and lack 
of experience. And her socialite status among her peers was no longer 
there to shield her. Instead, she had had to use her own skills at 
networking and business in order to survive the corporate world that 
threatened to drown her. Exercising that little brain of hers just to 
keep from getting swamped, and learn how to run one of the most powerful 
companies in Japan as her brother never chose to.

Amazingly enough, this is what had impressed Kozue when she had kept her 
finger on the pulse of things. Nanami not only survived...but she 
thrived. She had studied up on new technology and finance plans to 
become more informed and independent. She rebuilt her company from the 
bottom up, displaced those that had challenged or worked against her, 
and even eventually gained the board of directors in her pocket. No 
small feat, from what the Kaoru sister had heard. Nanami had become 
successful, stern, and cool....and had incredibly shown a very sharp 
intelligence. Much like her brother.

Kozue had found it outrageously sexy. Who had known that the blond ditz 
would ever turn out like that? They hadn&#39;t spoken since graduation, yet 
Kozue watched from a distance. Intrigued at the transformation, and at 
seeing that new serious face at the top of an article now and then.

Yet she had never dreamed in a million years that their paths would 
cross again at that party two months ago.

&quot;Are you ready? The others are about to leave.&quot; Nanami interrupted her 
distant thoughts as she tied her long hair back into a loose bun. Kozue 
sighed.

&quot;Yeah. As ready as I&#39;ll ever be. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The group was already waiting at the the double doors by the building 
entrance. When Kozue and Nanami reached them, they silently split into 
two groups. A small number was left to watch their backs from the rear 
as the rest of the duelists swiftly filed through the doorway into the 
entrance hall, and raced up the stairwell with their swords in hand. 
Fanning out so that they filled the narrow corridors and could have 
space to fight, they proceeded to carefully pass the dark empty dorm 
rooms. All were devoid of life and covered in dust. There was one room 
at the end of the hallway that seemed a bit fresher, door slightly ajar 
to reveal hardwood floor and a fallen dust cloth. But no one stopped to 
look inside, not even to glance at the name tags that had been untouched 
for eight years.

Motioning with a slight inclination of his head and a hand signal, Touga 
waited for the others to pass him up and along the next section of 
stairs before following behind with Miki to head up to the roof. The 
duelists burst onto the top of the East Dorm, a small army of swordsmen 
and women ready for their enemies to descend on them immediately. But 
suspiciously, none came. Not letting down her guard, Juri shifted over 
from her position on point, to allow Touga to come up beside her and 
take the lead. He regarded their surroundings carefully before locking 
gazes upon the three figures standing across the rooftop. The last three 
Swords...and Anthy.

He could feel Saionji stir restlessly beside him, but the green man made 
no move to go over to her. They&#39;d learn caution when dealing with such 
dangerous foes. The sound of slow sarcastic clapping brought their 
attention to the One, who was slowly stalking toward them.

&quot;Well well. The brave little duelists made it all the way here. And 
look! You even have some old friends. I&#39;m sad. You took my friends away 
from me.&quot; Utena&#39;s face took on a falsely mournful expression, as she 
stopped just a few feet away from them. Her silver eyes gazed at each of 
them in turn, taking in the tension that seemed to come off of them in 
waves. &quot;That hurts you know. So I invited some new friends to the party, 
all of whom are very eager to see you.&quot; The One smiled benevolently. But 
gradually the smile became a cruel smirk as Touga pointed his katana at 
her throat.

&quot;How unfortunate you won&#39;t be here to greet them. Won&#39;t you kindly 
return that body you&#39;ve been using?&quot; His words were carefree but his 
voice held no warmth. The club owner was in a kendo stance, his posture 
perfect and the blade balanced neatly in his hands. A change from the 
smooth-talking playboy attitude he normally displayed.

The One put a finger to her lip and casually pondered. &quot;Hmmm. No.&quot; She 
smiled cheerfully then and stepped aside as Jak lept over her with his 
blade held high. &quot;It&#39;s finally TIME!&quot; He arced downward in a vicious 
slicing motion that blurred the air in streams of sickly green light. 
Grunting, Touga parried the attack, ignoring the confetti of torn cloth 
that burst like a cloud around him. Without looking behind him, his 
voice rang out across the school yard.

&quot;ATTACK!&quot; And with that, his crimson ponytail flapping like a battle 
standard, Touga engaged Jak in combat. A dozen answering cries rose as 
the duelists charged into the fray, The One and Violet coming to meet 
them. The battle began finally in earnest, as the Swords prevented the 
duelists from getting close enough to free the struggling Anthy. Sparks 
from sawing and scissoring blades lit up grimacing faces. As they 
struggled to quickly overwhelm the three remaining (and most powerful) 
of the Swords of Hatred, the duelists teamed up to take them down. But 
found themselves just barely holding their own against a superior force 
unlike anything they had ever known.

Juri ducked under an ugly cut to her head as she tried to knock Violet 
off balance. But barely had time to block as a kick met her gut instead. 
She grunted and slipped behind Shiori who maneuvered in to block a 
follow-up strike. Her face was cool as she turned aside a thrust aimed 
for her heart, sending it to the side. But her counter-attack was easily 
deflected by the expressionless Sword she faced.

Miki came in a tight lunge from the other side, intending to skewer her. 
But gasped as he was caught around the collar by small manicured nails 
and sent crashed forward into Shiori instead. Juri rolled out of the way 
and leg-sweeped Violet off her feet. Or tried. Instead, Violet flipped 
backwards to land onto a small air conditioning unit on the roof, and 
gave a small dismissive wave of her hand. A small vortex of twisted 
space opened above her head, and from it a hail of translucent blades 
speared down from within. Scattering before the rain of bruise-colored 
magic swords, they split up and moved to try and surround her once more. 
The Sword possessing Violet sighed, and materialized a second blade in 
her free hand. A nuisance. Especially when it was all for naught 
anyway...

Elsewhere, Touga was working alongside Akio and Nanami to try and remove 
the One. Nearby and close to the edge of the roof were Saionji, Kozue, 
and Wakaba who faced the whirlwind of violence that was Jak. Everyone 
had their hands full, and so far it looked like a stalemate from what 
the red-haired man could quickly glean as he tried to keep focused on 
his own fight. But things would deteriorate unless they could somehow 
gain a foothold. Their bodies were already tired and injured...and their 
opponents never tired. No. If they didn&#39;t hurry and end this, not only 
would they lose their lives, they&#39;d lose Anthy as well...with everything 
that implied.

As he and Akio were sent skidding back by slam from an invisible wall, 
Touga looked up sharply as he heard a sharp cry of panic and a loud 
crash from the direction of the fighters beside him. Worried someone had 
slipped over the edge, he locked his gaze on Wakaba who was indeed 
standing on the edge. But it wasn&#39;t an attack from Jak that had made her 
pale in fear. Breaking away from where he had been locking swords with 
Utena, who was now grinning madly in glee, he directed a quick glance at 
the direction she was looking. And felt ice water run through his 
veins...

The massive school gates were now lying in a bent heap on the ground, 
forced from their hinges, as a flood of howling snarling demons came 
pouring and shoving their way through the gap. And kept coming. And kept 
coming. He watched in horror as the Thousand Swords entered the school 
grounds like an upset anthill, and came like a black tide to sweep over 
the East Dorms.

They were powerless to stop it.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Anthy watched above her as the tornado of light swirled painfully inch 
by inch downward, creeping steadily closer to her prone body. Trapped, 
she tried to tilt her head backward far enough to see the progress of 
the battle behind her. The grit on the rough concrete scrapped into her 
scalp as she focused her hazy eyes on the melee being fought out by the 
indistinct shapes of her rescuers. Touga had begun calling out orders, 
his voice stern and sharp with some new urgency. Under his direction, 
the groups condensed and formed together to create a protective wall of 
swords and bodies. Pushing forward they strove to drive the Swords 
backward while at the same time defend against the onslaught of 
unearthly black magic that stormed around them.

The One had fallen back once more to let her lesser siblings take care 
of things, her mind focusing on directing the charging Sword horde that 
swiftly approached their location. Already, the first of them had kicked 
in the doors below.

Anthy could feel the swell of dark energy burning all around her, the 
sky ahead changing from its ugly black to a sooty blood-red as events 
began to reach their climax. Utena lifted her arms to the sky, short 
pink hair wafting out of their stiff spikes. A rumble in the earth 
signaled a magic barrier being raised around the school to keep the law 
enforcement and news crews out and from interfering. Tears began to 
stream from Anthy&#39;s eyes. They had failed. There was no more time, the 
slaughter was upon them. This was the end of everything.

She choked on a sob that shook her aching body. Closing her eyes, she 
could not drown out the roaring wind that had picked up around them. Or 
the roaring from inside the dorm building below.

No.

Anthy squeezed her eyes tighter as a hot outrage began to shout from 
deep within. It grew as her eyes opened once more, burning as a flame of 
determination in her eyes.

No. No more killing. No more suffering.

She grit her teeth down onto the filthy damp gag in her mouth, her 
forehead creasing as an overwhelming feeling poured through her. It 
drowned out her fear and pain and sorrow. A fury blazed through her, 
full of the injustice, the deep love, and the will to live. To win! She 
would not lose. Not like this. Not to this!

She would not lose Utena!

Her eyes narrowing and glowing green, she summoned her resolve and 
steeled herself. Slowly, she forced her left arm upward, grinding 
painfully up the blade that held it pinned firmly into the concrete. 
Sweat beading up on her forehead and trickling down the side of her 
face, her muscles screaming in the pain that flamed through her arm and 
all the way up her shoulder. But she kept going until her stabbed 
forearm bumped with another spike of agony against the hilt of the short 
sword. Silently, her teeth worrying through the gag, Anthy&#39;s eyes 
narrowed to dangerous slits. Inside its concrete sheath, the tip of the 
sword scraped slightly side to side. And slowly wiggled upward...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Miki fall back! Shiori back up Nanami! Saionji, continue helping Akio 
bar the door! Hurry everyone, there&#39;s no time!&quot; Touga ordered, acting as 
the general on the battlefield in the midst of the bloody chaos. Bearing 
a fresh wound over his eye, he impatiently swiped at the blood 
threatening to blind him. Jak&#39;s arm was hanging limply after being 
dislocated earlier. Growling like a dog, he tried to snake around 
Kozue&#39;s guard, but Miki was there to block him. Their defense was tight 
enough to prevent him from getting his broadsword in, but they still had 
Violet to contend with.

&quot;Shit! Does anyone know what this guy&#39;s weakness is? He&#39;s pissing me 
off!&quot; Kozue growled angrily back as Jak once more got in her face. 
Saionji was yanked backwards by Akio as another hail of swords from 
Violet appeared. A strange light came in Miki&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I...I-I do!&quot; He pressed a couple of fingers to his temple as if he had 
a headache. Nanami was doing the same, having overheard.

&quot;Err...Authority. He hates to be ordered around. I remember from 
when...w-when I was--&quot;

&quot;Pay attention!&quot; Kozue cried, block a swiped from Jak, who despite 
having only one arm was having no trouble driving them back.

&quot;Sorry! But where are we going to...&quot; Miki trailed off as he looked up 
in surprise. Jak was howling in pain and rage, startling several of the 
duelists from their mindless fighting. The other two Swords whirled as 
well. The One then cried out in rage as she continued moving her hands 
in spell work; unable to stop. Unexpectedly Anthy stepped from behind 
Jak, holding a bloody short sword. A second was buried into his lower 
back, just missing the vital organs on the other side of the flesh wall. 
Anthy&#39;s eyes were glowing with an inner light, as trails of energy 
connected her hand to the buried sword hilt. The Sword of Hatred of 
Authority was paralyzed in place, unable to move. Anthy snapped them out 
of their daze.

&quot;What are you waiting for, fools?!&quot;

Coming back to himself, Miki quickly stabbed Jak in the heart. The 
duelists nearby watched as the possessing spirit within shrieked and was 
expelled from his open mouth and eyes. The transparent young boy , still 
screaming childish threats, dissipated in the night air and the freed 
musician slumped to the ground in a heap.

&quot;Man. Rather impressive work there, lady. Just hitting that right spot 
and all.&quot; Kozue remarked impressed, and dying for a cigarette.

&quot;Practice.&quot; Anthy replied glibly, and not in the mood.

Ignoring them Juri and Shiori charged forward with Touga between them to 
shield them from attacks from above. Anthy was quickly engulfed into the 
ranks of the duelists, Akio and Saionji acting as guards as Wakaba 
quickly worked to stop the heavy bleeding from her arms and legs. The 
wounds were bad, the creases of Anthy&#39;s eyes showing exhaustion and 
pain. Wakaba was stunned that despite fatigue and heavy blood loss, she 
was still even on her feet. A loud vibration jarred her badly, making 
her fumble with the bandages she held in her teeth.

The door to their right shook with a loud crash. A second loud crash hit 
it again from the other side, nudging forward the barricade of piping 
and old wooden crates that had been quickly constructed from whatever 
was lying around on the roof. It would not last more than a couple of 
minutes! Already it was bowing outward from the inhuman force applied as 
several bodies threw themselves against it again and again.

Anthy pulled away from Wakaba, stumbling slightly as Miki appeared on 
her elbow to help her. Keeping his sword arm free as he deflected the 
few attacks that came from the magic sword lances, he aided her.

&quot;There is no time left! We must end it now. Come, I will hold the girl!&quot;

Summoning hidden wells of strength Anthy began an incantation as she 
once more withdrew her deck of playing cards. Flying up in a spiral, her 
hair being torn at by the hurricane winds on the roof, the cards 
arranged themselves into a rose-shaped pattern. They glowed red as an 
archaic set of symbols set in a circle appeared below Violet&#39;s feet. 
Looking down and frowning, she tried to move but could not. Red glowing 
vines had grown up around her legs and held her in place.

The One turned, snarling with anger but finally finished with guiding 
her horde to the rooftop. They could manage on their own. The Sword 
within Violet looked at her, speaking for the first time. Her voice was 
haunting like cathedral bells &quot;One! Help me, I am imprisoned!&quot;

But the One didn&#39;t answer, choosing instead to slink to the side and 
launch her own magic attack at the group. A small team, consisting of 
just Nanami and Kozue, moved to put down Violet. She was still fierce 
however, and whirled her two scimitars around with shocking ease and 
fluidity to force them back.

&quot;One! They would slay me, and you would let them?! Are we not supposed 
to remake this world and sacrifice the witch together?!&quot;

Utena&#39;s dead eyes looked back balefully. &quot;Anyone so weak as to be 
captured by that witch deserves death. And I can make new Swords, with 
or without you sister.&quot;

Violet ground her teeth in rage and jerked back to roar at the sky. A 
maelstrom of energy burst from her, lashing out at everything in reach. 
The One cried out and leaped to land nimbly on her hands and feet on the 
edge corner of the roof. There were several scorch marks on her arms and 
torso, her hair smoking. The duelists cowered, and the two women trying 
to stab Violet were thrown onto their backs.

&quot;Always betrayed! ALWAYS!! Your kind NEVER changes! I give you 
everything, I sacrifice my love for you time and again, and yet...even 
though I expect it now from experience, you STILL find ways to BETRAY 
me!!&quot; Nanami and Kozue, the closest to the possessed girl who now clawed 
at the bleeding sky, gasped and writhed on the ground.

An overwhelming sadness threatened to break against them like a tsunami, 
as unbidden memories of their most painful experiences in Ohtori were 
wrenched to the forefront of their minds. Kozue burst into tears as she 
recalled Miki leaving her alone as a child to face those onlooking 
crowds of people at the recital...felt anguish choke her as she 
remembered how she was betrayed by lovers and her brother throughout 
their school days, the feelings of loss and the desperation to cling to 
whatever she had. She had hated herself for what she had become, but 
couldn&#39;t stop playing the new sort of adult games she had learned. How 
she had hated them all...especially Miki. Stupid brother who pretended 
to be blind to her feelings and whose self righteousness forced a rift 
between them. And loved them. A bitter ugly love that made her laugh 
sarcastically at the joke of a world she lived in, even as she kept on 
taunting and teasing. Kept sipping milkshakes to make him happy, kept 
going to those lingerie parties even though financially there wasn&#39;t a 
real need. And hating herself for that again, as new betrayals crept up 
every single day. New betrayals that all stemmed from her...the cycle 
never breaking...

Violet&#39;s Sword&#39;s Hatred was all encompassing, weakening the resolve of 
the rose duelists on the roof and making them fall to their knees under 
the blows of the One who still fought on unhindered. Whether this had 
been its intention all along or not was unclear...but the Sword 
capitalized upon it.

Nanami&#39;s eyes were rolled up into her head, her body squirming on the 
rough rooftop as she muttered incoherently, trapped in memories. Kozue 
struggled to roll over onto her side, her mind like brackish water that 
threatened to drown her as she struggled to break the surface again. 
Doggedly she fought on to escape the poison emanating from the Sword of 
Hatred&#39;s epicenter, and as she willed herself to fight...the rose sigil 
hidden upon her cheek slowly began to glow. As it began to glow 
brighter, Kozue struggled to sit up as her unfocused eyes began to clear 
and her thoughts began to crystallize. Coming to her hands and knees, 
half slouched beside Nanami, she grimaced as she fought against the 
spell. Nanami was crying as well, hands dug into her hair as she grasped 
her head in pain. Remembering encounters with Touga no doubt...or 
even...

Kozue&#39;s eyes suddenly snapped to full focus as she shifted to lean over 
Nanami, leaning close to listen to her mumbled words. The battle waging 
beyond them, the pulsating red vines that encased the Sword (now 
beginning to fracture and break as the spell began to run its final 
course as Anthy fought to hold it), Violet&#39;s howls at the world that had 
mistreated her and a Prince who had never come...all were forgotten. The 
world fell silent as Kozue put her ear to Nanami&#39;s lips. The blond, eyes 
blind, rasped tearfully.

&quot;...Kozue...why?&quot;

Kozue&#39;s blue eyes narrowed sharply. No... Nanami was being forced to 
remember her! Nanami felt she was...betrayed? Yes. Of course she would. 
Sadly the blue haired woman ran her finely shaped nails along Nanami&#39;s 
sweaty cheek, smoothing her tousled hair as the woman struggled. All 
thoughts of fighting now gone.

&quot;Nana-chan...&quot; Kozue whispered, leaning close enough to study her pained 
features, and planting her arms on both sides of Nanami&#39;s torso to keep 
her from rolling around any more. The business woman beneath her arched 
her back, but was firmly restricted.

&quot;Nanami, no...please...&quot; Kozue murmured as she planted a soft kiss onto 
Nanami&#39;s forehead as if to soothe her. &quot;Please don&#39;t hate me...I...I 
never meant to betray you.&quot; The rose sigil continued to glow on her 
cheek, a bright pinprick of light in the gloom.

Unheedingly, she continued to be swept by her nightmares. So Kozue went 
on, her voice gaining strength. &quot;Nanami! Listen to me.&quot; She straddled 
her ex-lover with her knees, freeing her hands to grasp the girls wrists 
and gently pull them from out of her hair where she&#39;d begun to tug at it 
more violently.

&quot;I&#39;ve never intended to hurt you like this...you must believe me! 
Despite the jokes. The little things between us, I never wanted to hurt 
you. Never. I was just...scared.&quot; Eyes filled with remorse Kozue planted 
a delicate kiss on Nanami&#39;s lips, closing her eyes as she went on a 
hairsbreadth away. &quot;I didn&#39;t forget you after graduation...somehow I 
couldn&#39;t, even though we weren&#39;t really friends. You were always more 
interested in hanging out with my brother since he was on the Council. 
But I watched you...from a distance. And I was always impressed and awed 
by what you overcame when Touga left you with the company. You were so 
strong and beautiful.&quot; Kozue went on, eyes still closed. Beneath her she 
felt Nanami stilling, her struggles quieting.

&quot;But I never imagined I&#39;d actually meet up with you again. We hadn&#39;t 
seen each other&#39;s faces for years...then suddenly, two months 
ago...there you were.&quot; Kozue opened her eyes to find Nanami&#39;s own blue 
ones looking back into hers. Her eyes were clearing as they stared into 
each other&#39;s eyes, Kozue&#39;s words seeming to draw her up out of her 
Sword-inflicted misery.

&quot;Nanami...when I came over to that couch with all of those business 
women giggling and flirting and playing about with the other models and 
lingerie samples...you were sitting there alone in that loose unbuttoned 
blouse. And I saw you watching only me. It was the first time I...I 
think I&#39;ve ever actually blushed at one of those things.&quot;

The blond beneath her who had been listening to her with questioning 
eyes gave a small smile, eyes softening as Kozue went on, not stopping. 
Her voice came faster and more breathy, as if she didn&#39;t get it out now 
she never would. Probably wouldn&#39;t. What better time than the end of the 
world? The sounds of metal clashing and the door splintering and bowing 
outward began to filter in behind them. Kozue stroked her face 
delicately in spite of it all.

&quot;Nanami I&#39;ve always liked you. But the moment I felt your eyes on mine? 
I knew I loved you. That&#39;s what scared me...not the feeling of being 
confined, or you trying to monopolize my time. Not being dragged to this 
date and that like a show animal. Those were all just excuses. Reasons 
to argue.&quot;

Nanami placed a hand over her own, hair sprawled beneath her as she 
remained uncharacteristically silent; just listening...

&quot;I was scared because of how much I loved you. Because I have never 
loved anyone as powerfully.&quot; Kozue ran the back of her hand along 
Nanami&#39;s cheek. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for running away. Please don&#39;t hate me 
anymore.&quot;

Smiling sardonically Nanami&#39;s once pained features now became tiredly 
sarcastic. &quot;Hmph. It took you this long to admit it? I told you the same 
thing every time we made love, moron.&quot; And reaching up she took Kozue&#39;s 
face in her hands and kissed her deeply. Melting into the kiss, Kozue&#39;s 
frazzled nerves soothed and the sigil pulsed on her cheek before fading 
away. From above them, Violet&#39;s voice drew them apart once more, as 
fragile and sharp as splintered glass.

&quot;You...you shouldn&#39;t...l-listen! They lie time and again...&quot; but her 
words were hollow, her face looking defeated. Kozue noticed she now had 
sparks of blue-white electricity crackling around her form, expanding 
from a space above her heart. Eyebrows narrowing as she stood up and 
reached down to help Nanami to her feet, Kozue answered. &quot;Yes we do. But 
sometimes we repent. And sometime we can be forgiven. I love her.&quot; 
Violet hissed, strangely tears coming to her own eyes.

Nanami picked up Kozue&#39;s sword and held it up to allow Kozue to place 
her hand atop hers. The blade glowed white-hot with power as they turned 
as one to the imprisoned Sword. It looked up at them with its silver 
eyes, shoulders drooped in defeat. The One glanced back at her and 
turned away.

&quot;...I wish he had loved me the same...&quot; it whispered, right as the two 
women thrust the blade into its heart.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

When Kozue and Nanami moved to rejoin the main battle, chaos had 
erupted. The duelists were being overwhelmed by trying to throw 
everything they had at keeping that damn door closed around the many 
reaching grasping hands that appeared in its holes. All struggling to 
reach through the shattering doorway and yank them bodily through. The 
rest were trying to fend off the One&#39;s attacks while protecting Anthy, 
who at the moment was flinging spells like her life depended on it. 
Which it did. And all the while, the tornado of swords had grown larger 
overhead as it descended ever closer to the roof. If it reached them, 
they would perish.

Angling to try and catch the One off-guard, Nanami and Kozue worked to 
pincer her in between the two groups and capture her. They were wary 
when she turned to face them and lifted her hand to the sky. But neither 
were prepared when a massive silver blade misted into existence above 
them all like a giant&#39;s knife, slammed down onto the rooftop and 
splitting it in half. The humans cried out in alarm as the building 
groaned and the rooftop suddenly sloped down into the middle causing 
them to slide. Thankfully it didn&#39;t crumble completely or they would 
have fallen. As they clamored once more to their feet, Touga angrily 
swiped at stringy filthy strands of hair that were now plastered to his 
face.

&quot;This monster is the last! We can still win this, we just have to get 
rid of her!!&quot; But even he knew it was easier said than done. They were 
spent. They had nothing left inside of them. What hope did they have to 
defeat the greatest of all the Swords...who looked as fresh as when she 
began? Laughing maniacally Utena arched her back to the sky as if 
reading his thoughts. It would take a miracle.

And that&#39;s when the door broke inward.

Saionji cried out in alarm as a torrent of gnashing human teeth and 
hands exploded through the doorway and snagged him by the shirt collar 
to sweep him into the tide of lost humanity. Akio was yanked by his hair 
down by a pair of girls with gleaming silver eyes and foaming lips. The 
duelists erupted into screams as the Thousand Swords poured on top of 
the jagged rooftop. The One stood in the middle like a rock, the bodies 
shoving around her acting as the current. Still laughing. Triumphant!

Touga fell under the weight of several heavy-set men, and cried out as 
he was kicked and trampled. As a boot came down onto his head, he looked 
up to see nothing but a world full of faces contorted in utter hate. As 
his vision began to fade to black, he could only feel sorrow that this 
was how it all would end...for nothing...

He almost didn&#39;t feel the arms grasp him around the waist and pull him 
upward out of the thronging mass.

Broken and bleeding, wondering if he was dreaming...Touga weakly gazed 
into the face of a man he never thought he&#39;d see again. &quot;...Ruka...&quot; 
Touga whispered hoarse. Before his eyes rolled up in their sockets and 
he passed out.

The ghost, or perhaps he was something more now, lifted Touga up and out 
of the hellish nightmare below. It set him down on the rooftop of the 
adjacent building where the other duelists where now arriving thanks to 
Anthy and her magic bubble again. The witch, gazed back across the space 
between them and locked gazes with the One, who actually seemed 
disappointed.

&quot;You still have the strength for your witchcraft? How irritating. Don&#39;t 
you know how to properly die?&quot; The duelists were all lying in crumpled 
heaps around her, no longer able to fight. They had escaped with their 
lives...but at what cost? Out of them all, only Nanami, Akio, and Wakaba 
were still conscious. Akio more through sheer force of will. But none of 
them were in any condition to pick up a sword. The list of injuries and 
broken bones alone were...near catastrophic.

Ruka hovered in a faint glow near Juri and Shiori, who had been laid 
side by side as they weakly struggled to breath.

&quot;Ruka...thank you...I know you must have used much of your power to aide 
us.&quot; Anthy whispered, her shoulders slumped tiredly. And indeed, he 
seemed to be fading out of exisitence as she spoke. He seemed to give a 
nod, little more than a faint glowing human shape. &quot;It has to end 
Anthy...the door to the past must be closed...&quot; And with those echoing 
parting words, he shimmered out of exisitence.

Sadly he was right. It was only a matter of time before the mob made its 
way over here. They couldn&#39;t keep running. She couldn&#39;t go on any 
further.. But what could they do? What could they do? She sat down on 
the new roof, feeling dizzy, and put her head in her hands. A strong 
warm hand laid itself on her shoulder. She looked up to see Akio smiling 
down at her, his face a mask of blood. But somehow it was 
still...gentle. A word she hadn&#39;t used for him in a long long time.

&quot;Anthy...you and I both know this is the final gambit. And everything 
rests on our next course of action. We can&#39;t depend on our noble knights 
any longer...&quot;

Anthy sighed and rested a delicate hand atop his own, their blood 
mingling across her skin. &quot;Yes. I know... I&#39;ve put them all through so 
much, only to lead them to defeat. I&#39;m a failure Akio.&quot; The One was 
giving orders across from them, but paused to blow her a kiss and point 
upward to the sky. The tornado of light had nearly touched down.

Akio looked on, his eyes suddenly ageless as Anthy&#39;s own now were. &quot;They 
are shadows from the past. Our past.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;Anthy.&quot; She looked up at him, her green eyes meeting his own. &quot;This is 
no longer your battle either. Your only fight now is to rescue Utena.&quot; 
He strode to the edge of the building. She struggled to her feet as she 
watched him balance on the edge.

&quot;Brother! What are you doing?! Stop!&quot; Her voice held a panicked edge as 
she grabbed his arm with both of her hands and tried to tug him back 
away. &quot;You&#39;ll fall!&quot;

But Akio didn&#39;t budge, just continue gazing out across the abyss. &quot;Yes. 
And its time that this old Prince did. I have already fallen this far, I 
want to head to the bottom.&quot;

He smiled and as he stepped forward into space, The One whipped its head 
around like a raptor and hissed.

&quot;Stop!&quot;

&quot;Anthy...I still have a portion of myself remaining! My old self. This 
is what draws them to you and I, they are all figures from our original 
life!&quot; He cried out over the wind, which now had gone from mere gusts to 
a screaming velocity. His violet hair blew free in lose streams around 
his face, mingling with Anthy&#39;s.

&quot;I cannot beat the One, but I can exorcise its army! They will still 
answer my call! T...Tell Kanae that I did love her. And that I know 
she&#39;ll find happiness!!&quot;

Smiling peacefully, he leaped off the side of the building. Anthy 
screamed after him as he disappeared from view, and jerked in horror 
when there was a loud thud. Shrieking in sorrow as she leaned over the 
side and saw the broken twisted body of who used to be Akio Ohtori, she 
clawed at her cheeks with her nails. The witch wailed her misery as the 
life force of her brother disappeared completely from her heart. &quot; NO!! 
AKIOOOOOO!!&quot; She fell to her hands and knees sobbing. Everything...she 
had lost...everything...

Suddenly a burst of light from below made her wrench her head back up. 
With a loud whinny and a sound of trumpets, a golden-bodied figure 
riding upon a horse that glowed like starlight burst from Akio&#39;s broken 
shell below. It flew up into the sky like quicksilver, the golden figure 
caped and crowned like a noble from legend, and twisted in the air to 
face the beings gathered below it. A bright shining glow burst from the 
spiritual beings as Prince Dios raised his sword high into the air.

The sky of blood and fire parted as a ray of light fell upon the sword 
and it burst into flames. The One, its face twisted and bestial in the 
face of the holy sword shrieked metallically and jumped off of the 
building to land in the shadows below...escaping as Dios and his steed 
charged the rooftop of still-clamoring swords.

Anthy, yards away, watched in disbelief as the spirit horse and rider 
flew down like a comet. Then shielded her face with her hands as Dios 
and his sword collided with the rooftop and sent it into a golden blaze 
of fire. The shock wave from the impact knocked Anthy back onto her rump 
as looked back up. That rooftop was now littered with bodies, all of 
them unconscious. The tornado of swords however was still there, 
swirling and tinkling with steel and magic and light.

Hunting about wildly to see where Dios had gone, she found him in the 
sky once more, gazing down at her. As she watched tearfully, the purged 
souls that had inhabited the mob&#39;s collective bodies rose up as lights 
to trail upward to meet him. Gazing back at her expressionlessly, he 
gave a slow bow from his saddle. Lifting he nodded his head once at her 
and turned to gaze up at the moon. With the lights creating a glowing 
trail behind him, Dios rode up into the sky and finally disappeared.

Akio...no, Dios...her brother. He was finally gone. He was really gone 
this time. She looked down at her hand, which had only moments ago held 
his. With this, everything would change. She closed her eyes briefly as 
tears once more filled them. And then she heard a small scrape just 
underneath the roof&#39;s edge. Glancing up, her body moved of its own 
accord to see what had made the sound...and a hand shot over top of the 
side to grab her by the throat. Anthy felt her herself jerked to the 
edge and came face to face with a demon. Utena&#39;s silver eyes bled fire, 
her face twisted with an unspeakable rage. Roaring, She threw Anthy back 
across the roof and climbed up after her.

The dark skinned woman crashed and tumbled across the prone bodies of 
her friends, gasping as her wounds were jarred and the wind knocked out 
of her. In an eye blink, Utena was there, picking her up again.

&quot;You filthy WRETCH! You and your damnable BROTHER have RUINED IT!!&quot; The 
One screamed at her from inches away. Anthy winced as her ears rang, 
still trying to gasp for breath. She was too weak to fight back as she 
was shook like a rag doll.

&quot;WHORE! But not all is lost. You hear me, pig&#39;s bride?! I still have YOU 
after all! And I can still salvage this wreckage!!&quot; It stopped shaking 
her long enough for Anthy to try and get her wits about her as she 
grabbed its wrist with her hands. The One gloated.

&quot;That spell over there is waiting for you. It requires a sacrifice, as 
all proper things do...and once your body is torn to shreds, the door to 
my new glory will be opened. And now I needn&#39;t share it with useless 
riff-raff!!&quot;

Anthy glared back, her teeth clenched as she refused to give in to the 
pressure trying to bend her will. &quot;What are you! You aren&#39;t someone from 
the past...you&#39;re different! You were never human. What kind of Hatred 
are you?!&quot;

The One sneered, its face disdainful. &quot;I am from a past far more distant 
than yours...as if it would even matter. Fool! Don&#39;t you recognize 
what&#39;s before you?&quot; It leaned its face close enough to her let its hot 
breath cross her lips. &quot;I&#39;m Hatred. I am Hatred! Hatred of Everything! 
All encompassing, unforgiving, equal in my detestation of all things 
that creep&#39;th upon the earth. Religion, relationships, civilizations, 
beasts...I Hate them all! And lo, they shall feel my Hate and be 
consumed by its flames...&quot; A forked tongue slithered from Utena&#39;s lips.

Anthy paled, but bit her lip in resolve. She could not waver in the 
battle of wills. &quot;You made the original Swords...you poisoned the hearts 
of those people.&quot;

&quot;I strengthened what was already there. And gave life to the weapons 
inside.&quot;

&quot;You twisted their feelings! You hurt them and made them a liar&#39;s deal.&quot;

&quot;Oh no Anthy, child...I gave them what they wanted. They wanted to hurt 
you and that little Prince...to let out their real feelings. I just gave 
them a means. The chance to change things. And oh, did things change...&quot;

The thing, who&#39;s features were beginning to become less and less human 
much to Anthy&#39;s dismay, loosened its grip upon her swollen neck and 
caressed her cheek.

&quot;You&#39;ve broken my new siblings...my confidantes. You and that bitch 
Tenjou Utena. But I can make new ones. I have gained much from your 
suffering over these long centuries...and now...now dreams that were 
never once dared can be realized!&quot;

It turned and gestured to the tornado of swords, its light pulsating 
coldly from where it now spun rapidly in place upon the roof of the East 
Dorm. It had finally touched down, and its size had grown. In the middle 
of the tornado, Anthy could faintly make out what looked like an archway 
draped in hooks and chains. Hatred watched her face in satisfaction.

&quot;Yes...the sacrificial gate. You shall serve your final purpose, and 
this restricting deal with your woman shall be annulled. She&#39;s far too 
weak to protest now anyway.&quot;

But as the demon turned to drag her off the roof, it jerked to a halt. 
Turning back, it saw that Anthy had planted her feet and was stubbornly 
refusing to move. It narrowed its borrowed eyes, and tried to yank her 
forward but Anthy clamped her hands tighter around its wrists.

&quot;Come! Enough of your foolishness, I&#39;ll break those legs if I have to.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;No? Ha!&quot; It laughed, amused. But Anthy held its gaze calmly.

&quot;No. Because I love you.&quot;

&quot;....&quot; Hatred raised its eyebrow, it humor leaving its face just as 
quickly as it came. Its silver eyes were as cold and as merciless as the 
snowfields in winter. &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;

&quot;I love you. I love you, all of you! I won&#39;t leave you.&quot;

Hatred smirks. &quot;How cute. And nice try.&quot;

With a smile, it gave a rough tug and Anthy flew up off the ground as if 
she&#39;d sprouted wings. Crushing her painfully to its body, it smirked 
down at her. &quot;You should know better than that.

And that&#39;s when Anthy pressed in for the kiss. Hatred froze, shock and 
rage on its face as the cunning woman pressed her mouth full on its own. 
But it remained paralyzed in place as impossibly he felt her heart open 
like a floodgate and wash with feelings of intense and deep....

...Love.

Anthy concentrated, taking Utena&#39;s cheeks into her hands to keep their 
mouths pressed firmly together. With a discipline formed from centuries 
of practicing her craft...of being burdened by her sins and 
failings...Anthy opened her heart and channeled it through the 
connection of their lips. She let feelings of pain, anguish and sorrow 
flow away...the fear of losing Utena and their friends...the fresh raw 
hurt from watching her brother sacrifice himself... it was noted and 
then released. And in its place she summoned up the warmth and caring 
newly found in reuniting with her duelists. Her knights. The deep 
respect and admiration she had for each of them and the happiness she 
had found in the new life she had gained when Utena had freed her. And 
the bottomless emotions that Utena, her Prince and savior, evoked.

Anthy kissed not Hatred, but sought to reach Utena herself, trapped 
within. Sending her message of love, devotion, and eternal oath of 
fidelity with every press of their skin. The opposite of Undying Hatred, 
Anthy offered True Love.

And like a miracle, a connection secured like a crackling rope of 
electricity in her mind. A tiny pulse on the other end, weak and 
fragile. Like the heartbeat of a baby bird. Focusing on that one link 
like a snare, the witch threw everything she had within her to follow 
it. Eyes glazing over as their bodies remained entwined, Anthy felt her 
mind slip and then fall forward into a dark abyss...

....

......all was darkness....

........Anthy could see and hear nothing, just feel the rushing of 
invisible wind as she fell. She felt no worry at reaching the bottom 
however. And gradually, she felt herself slowing as she touched down 
gently onto black sand. She was in the middle of a wasteland, the space 
in front of her had lightened to a miserable shade of gray. Just enough 
to make out the forms of twisted gnarled trees surrounding her on the 
windswept plain. But it was not enough to give a hint as to how big the 
expanse actually was. Tucking a stray wafting strand of hair behind her 
ear, she gazed about her trying to feel which direction she should go. 
Utena had to be here somewhere.

Narrowing her eyes, she scanned the horizon closer as she opened up that 
piece inside of her that had linked to Utena to begin with. Following 
that tiny silver thread, she began to walk forward, leaving footprints 
in the sand behind her.

She had no idea how much time had passed. Time itself seemed to have no 
meaning here, and instead was as turbulent and shifting as stormy seas. 
With it came a feeling of eternity and age. Old yet not. Broken yet not. 
As if dust needed to be blown from the entire world, but it choked too 
thickly to do so. Anthy who was accustomed to such sensations, didn&#39;t 
pause as she continued walking in a bee-line for the source of her 
connection. The world around her melted and swirled, as it formed a new 
picture in the painting. And there she was.

Anthy stopped before a marble structure that rose from the sands around 
it in cascading rises and columns. A shrine now broken and dilapidated 
lying in ruin amidst the sands. As she stepped closer she found herself 
walking on a cobblestone path as she moved around a dry fountain and its 
chipped statue work. Just beyond it was a woman, suspended by chains in 
the middle of an archway, her body aching and shivering. Her body was 
coated in sweat, causing the dust in the wind to coat her skin and give 
it a dark appearance. With long hair covering her naked form and the 
woman&#39;s head down limply at the ground, Anthy trembled. It looked like 
her.

But as she stepped closer, the head tiredly lifted itself to stare 
blindly in her direction, and gray light caught and dully reflected blue 
eyes.

No...it was Utena!

A clinking of chains indicated Utena was trying to raise up further to 
focus on her position. Anthy stepped forward, stretching out a hand to 
touch the tortured body that struggled weakly to find her. &quot;Utena...what 
have they done to you....&quot;

Head lolling, Utena slowly blinked and seemed to come back to herself a 
bit. &quot;Mnngh...A....Anthy....&quot; A hand gently stoked her calf, the highest 
it could reach.

&quot;Utena! It&#39;s me, I&#39;m here now...I&#39;ve come to free you.&quot;

But Utena shook her head mutely and turned her face away. Anthy, 
distressed, moved to follow her line of sight. &quot;Why? Why won&#39;t you look 
at me? Is it true that you really do hate me? Utena...I would take it 
all back if I c--&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Utena groaned, her back arching as the chains tightened and the 
hooks stuck within her skin slowly pulled tighter. Panting she squeezed 
her eyes shut as Anthy stifled a sob of anguish with her hands. Utena 
had taken her place...why? Why was this...?


&quot;N...No...n-never...could never...&quot; Utena mumbled, becoming incoherent 
as her head rolled back down again dumbly. Afraid to touch her again 
lest she spark another attack, Anthy moved to peer up at Utena from 
below, her eyes locked firmly on those painfully familiar robin&#39;s egg 
blue. Neither seemed to notice Utena&#39;s naked and vulnerable state.

&quot;If you don&#39;t hate me, then why don&#39;t you want me here? Don&#39;t you want 
to be free of that monster?&quot; Anthy probed with her words, but also with 
her heart...carefully watching.

&quot;Can&#39;t...h...hate you...but I...I did I...I did hate you...for that 
moment I...broken...I broken...I&#39;m....&quot;

Anthy grabbed Utena&#39;s leg again, willing her to listen and look at her. 
&quot;Listen to me...you&#39;re human for gods&#39; sake. You are a living breathing 
human, and if you hated me at that moment I couldn&#39;t have blamed you! I 
don&#39;t blame you even now! Those Swords would have whispered anything, 
done anything to get you to have mercy on them... And I am more than 
deserving of your hate. But Utena...I don&#39;t hate you!&quot;

Utena&#39;s head slowly lifting, seeming a momentous task. But she seemed 
unable to find the strength to speak. Anthy appealed to her, her voice 
to ringing clear and sharp. &quot;Utena! Look at me now!&quot; Utena&#39;s face 
flinched and she did, her eyes wide and frightened. &quot;Why are you doing 
this to yourself? Why are you punishing yourself?&quot;

&quot;I...failed...&quot; came the hoarse reply, and Utena&#39;s face became shameful. 
The chains began to tighten again, but Anthy threw her head back and 
refused to back away.

&quot;Why? You saved me. You stopped the duels despite all odds! You risked 
your life and broke the Swords of Hatred!&quot;

&quot;I...I couldn&#39;t f-finish it. I...was too a-afraid. I wasn&#39;t 
a...P-Prince, I...&quot;

&quot;No. You were Utena. And that was more important.&quot;

&quot;I h-hurt...everyone. I was too...w-weak...to say no...&quot; The pink haired 
woman hissed in pain as the hooks dug deeper into her back.

&quot;You made a mistake. You let them out.&quot;

&quot;Yesssss!&quot;

&quot;But we forgive you.&quot;

The clinking of chains stopped. Anthy went on determinedly.

&quot;Utena...you made a mistake. But no one is perfect...no one is free from 
ugly emotions and thoughts and feelings...least of all me. We love you, 
not perfection. We love you, Utena. All of you...&quot; Utena looked up at 
her, tears streaming down her face. Anthy hadn&#39;t noticed before, but the 
wet warmth on her cheeks confirmed that she was crying too.

&quot;Touga, Juri, Miki, Saionji Wakaba...all of them, they all care so much 
about you. Even when they forgot you. You still had a place reserved in 
their hearts. So much so that they fought to free you. To free us both 
from this hell! Utena, I love you more than I have loved anything or 
anyone...please...won&#39;t you come back to me?&quot;

The chains were slowly beginning to droop to the ground...and as they 
lowered, so did Utena&#39;s limp body. Anthy reached up and after a moment 
Utena fell into her waiting arms. Pulling the woman&#39;s body close, she 
watched as the chains slowly began to rust away. Soon they were gone, 
and Utena&#39;s filthy dusty body now shone cleanly against her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Anthy...&quot; She whispered against her collar bone, her body 
crushed desperately against Anthy&#39;s own. The other woman allowed them to 
sink to the ground, so that Utena was curled against her chest like a 
child&#39;s. &quot;I made a mess of everything...&quot;

&quot;Shhhh...&quot; Anthy soothed, stroking her hair and closing her eyes. She 
inhaled gently and placed a kiss atop her forehead. Utena encircled her 
waist with her arms.

&quot;It hurt so bad...I was broken...and I was scared. I didn&#39;t know dying 
could feel like that, and it frightened me. I thought I would lose 
everything, that everyone would just forget me and nothing would change. 
I was so...alone... I panicked. And it sickened me.&quot;

Anthy said nothing, just started rocking her beloved gently while Utena 
confessed softly to her. From within her throat she crooned wordlessly, 
never stopping as she kept on stroking her hair.

&quot;For awhile I was able to drown them out. Keep them inside, but it got 
harder...and soon I didn&#39;t care anymore. I&#39;m so sorry Anthy...&quot; Utena 
sobbed bitterly. She looked up as Anthy planted kisses on each of her 
eyes.

&quot;I know...and I forgive you.&quot;

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know if I forgive myself. I don&#39;t know if I can be strong 
again. I don&#39;t think I have it in me to be anyone&#39;s Prince anymore.&quot;

Anthy smiled down at her, her eyes brimming with love and caring. 
Kissing Utena carefully upon the lips, she parted to lean her forehead 
against hers.

&quot;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll be yours.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

It had only been mere seconds since Anthy&#39;s green eyes had blazed like 
molten lava and the signature blue electricity began to crackle across 
Hatred&#39;s stolen body. But suddenly Anthy gave a rattling intake of 
breath and her pupils dilated. The fire in her eyes died and she 
staggered back. The One&#39;s face twisted into a guttural snarl, and she 
bellowed out in desperate rejection. But as her throat tightened and her 
fingers grasped at the ground like claws, her silver eyes turned black 
and a thick mist began to expel from within her body. Like an ugly 
cloud, it funneled out of Utena&#39;s throat and eyes and formed into a 
vaguely animalistic shape that howled in time with the wind.

Utena&#39;s blue eyes blinked in confusion, before she swayed and fell to 
her knees in front of Anthy. The beast above them howled, still grasping 
for them. But as Anthy held Utena protectively it was sucked forcefully 
into the swirling vortex of light beyond.

&quot;NOOO! NOOO! I WON&#39;T GO BACK TO THAT DAMNABLE HELL!! NOT AGAIN!!&quot;

It grasped the edges of the whirling portal, trying to hold on. But 
something larger reached and snagged it about the waist, ripping it 
inside. There was a final scream, a clap like thunder, and both 
disappeared. A sizzling burnt mark and the scent of sulfur was the only 
evidence left behind. The blood-red sky above faded as the clouds began 
to filter with a change in the wind.

Anthy felt Utena stir in her arms, and looked down to find her Champion 
gazing up at her with honest relief and happiness.

&quot;...my...Prince...&quot;

Around them the duelists finally began to stir, just as the sun rose 
over the horizon.

It was over.

Sometime, two weeks later:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

She could recall at that moment the taste of sweet herbal tea that still 
lingered in her mouth. Feel the warm flutters in the pit of her stomach 
she couldn&#39;t seem to get rid of. The shadows that had been whispering 
and beckoning within her mind for the past eight years had finally 
quieted. And she felt peace for the first time in a long one.

Even now she could recall it. That glimpse of endless abyss waiting to 
stretch forth its maw and consume every part of her...and the blazing 
green eyes of a woman who absolutely would not let her fall. The hand 
that had pulled her away from the edge and into the warmest embrace she 
had ever felt. So full of deep love and caring, and fueled by the hearts 
and wills of nine other people all waiting to embrace her too.

Anthy&#39;s scent still clung to Utena, as she paced somewhat restlessly 
backstage in the holding area. It was so weird being back here. It felt 
as though everything had come full circle. She and the band were 
currently at Ocean 6 studios, about to be interviewed about their lead 
singer and her pending plans for retirement. Utena still wore dark 
clothing, but it seemed toned down now and much more simplistic. Her 
hair fell to her waist and kept getting into her eyes, much to the 
amusement of the others. But the dark circles under those eyes had 
faded, and she looked healthier and happier than she had in ages. 
Smiling to herself, she whistled quietly as the group was ushered by the 
assistant and sent to walk through the false door to the thundering of 
applause and cheers of the audience.

Lance and Eric gave hearty waves, Eric even going so far as to blow a 
kiss to a guy who was wearing a shirt with her name on it. Mason slunk 
in beside her and blew a kiss to the man too, earning some chuckles from 
the audience and cameramen. The two drummers, bassist, keyboard player, 
and lead guitarist all took their places on the posh chairs and couch, 
leaving the slightly taller stool for their lead singer. Utena took it 
gingerly, running a hand through her new long hair. It was now its 
original length, before she&#39;d made the devil&#39;s deal eight years ago and 
allowed her body to become home to the shattered Swords.

Lost in thought, she felt a hand on her knee and looked up to see Jared 
gazing back at her seriously. His mohawk was pink now, with a big heart 
in red, dyed on either side. The publicist had gleefully run with it, 
and their fans were still squealing about he &quot;wore it in honor of the 
person he cared for the most&quot;. It may or may not have been true. But it 
had made Utena laugh when she saw it. And that was what seemed to make 
Jared the most happy.

It was odd. These were people she had technically &#39;known&#39;. All of whom 
had been unwillingly pulled into her problems, then used and disposed. 
They had been lied to technically, since Utena hadn&#39;t exactly been 
honest about her identity. And while that wasn&#39;t entirely her fault, 
she&#39;d let their bodies be violated. Had hurt them. Had done the damage 
herself. With Anthy&#39;s help, she&#39;d managed to alter their memories to 
help them forget the real reasons for the chaos at that final concert. 
To change subtle details in what they recalled, so they wouldn&#39;t 
remember the Swords of Hatred or being possessed by them...but they 
still recalled the important things.

But even with all of that...how could they stand to look at her? Utena 
could feel tears prick at the corner of her eyes, and stiffened as Jared 
and Violet pulled her into a tight embrace. Relaxing she let them hug 
her, as she leaned down into their shared hug.

No. No more sadness or self pity. Utena would be grateful for the 
friendships she had made with these talented young people, and never 
forget the fond memories they had made together. Hearing the &quot;awwwws&quot; 
and happy crying from the audience, Utena opened her eyes and took in 
all of the people jammed into the studio audience and spilling out of 
the doors. So many people had been turned away, all who wanted to show 
support for Crysanthium Ecstasy. She smiled softly at them, humbled. The 
host had finally gotten the room quieted enough to begin the interview, 
and everyone listened in rapt attention.

&quot;Ten.&quot;

&quot;Please, in light of my upcoming retirement from the band...just call me 
Utena. That&#39;s my real name.&quot; She could practically hear the cellphones 
text messaging furiously beyond her.

&quot;Ah! Then Utena-san...its exactly about your retirement that we wanted 
to speak with you...get your thoughts. Why is it, that after your band&#39;s 
incredible tour around the world and the rising fame you all have 
obtained as a group...and especially you, Utena-san... Why retire? Why 
now?&quot; The woman in the mauve suit and gaudy pink accessories leaned in 
close, predatory. But Utena remained calm and relaxed. Giving a glance 
back at the people arranged on the couches behind her, smiling as Mason 
and Eric both mouthed &#39;you can do it!&#39; and gave a pair of thumbs up, she 
turned her attention back on the interviewer and ignored the buzzing 
cameras zooming around.

&quot;Well it&#39;s quite simple really. I feel that I&#39;ve come to a stage in my 
career where I...feel that I need to re-evaluate where I&#39;m heading. 
Decide what my goals are now. Our music has changed and so has our 
direction as a group. And despite the many wonderful memories I share 
with this very talented group of people...I feel it&#39;s time that I step 
aside and let them continue in their expansion. I&#39;m grateful that 
they&#39;ve let me come along for the ride as long as they have.&quot; Utena 
said, giving a small nod of affirmation.

The interviewer looked at her curiously. &quot;Then its true you were a later 
addition? The rumor of you and Jared meeting in a bar in America?&quot;

Jared grinned and cut in. &quot;Aw now. That bit&#39;s tricky, yeah? Wasn&#39;t a 
bar...but we did meet in a park when the chicky gave me some directions, 
ya know? One of &#39;em chance encounters I&#39;d say.&quot; Utena grinned, 
recalling.

&quot;I thought the guy was going to try and mug me, he was pretty rough 
looking.&quot;

The audience laughed at Jared&#39;s pained look. &quot;What what! You never said 
that, come on then! Look &#39;ere...how could you think this face was 
scary?&quot; He swished his head a bit to bring attention to his strawberry 
mohawk that matched Utena&#39;s own hair, and there was more laughter. 
Grinning as she shoved him away with a hand, she turned semi-serious 
again.

&quot;Yes it&#39;s true. But he introduced me to his friends and let me listen to 
them play at a small pub in town. The Horse and Saddle, it was called. I 
listened to them, and really was impressed by what I heard. So I ended 
coming back a few more times. Eventually they asked me to try playing 
with them for a bit.&quot; She glossed over the details smoothly. But the 
interviewer smelled a story. And like a hound on the scent she smiled 
engagingly and turned to one of the other members of the band, the 
rather quiet Mason.

&quot;Is that so? Mason, you were the sole drummer at that time if I recall 
correctly. What exactly were your first impressions when you all met 
Utena-san? How on earth did she become your lead singer? After all...its 
certainly something to have such an encounter on the street!&quot; There was 
excited chatter as Mason leaned forward and began telling an animated 
recount of that first meeting. Utena&#39;s mind wandered as she gazed out at 
the audience.

It had been something. But it truthfully had been an accidental 
meeting...one the Swords later took advantage of when Utena was offered 
a position in the band. That was when they had begun crafting their 
insidious plan for their rebirth and take over. They had sculpted her 
voice to an entirely other level as they grew stronger, and used her as 
a sort of siren to try and lure willing slaves to their cause. Their 
target would have been to eventually hunt down Anthy once they had grown 
in strength, but she had ended up coming to them...

Utena was nudged by a sharp elbow as Mason joked at her expense, &quot;Yeah. 
And she was like, a total book worm stick-in-the-mud. Super skinny, just 
like she is now and one of the sharpest tongues I ever met besides 
Eric.&quot; Eric mock-scowled and crossed her arms. &quot;But somehow she just 
drew you in...she had this...air about her.&quot;

Utena actually blushed, at the loud exclamations from the audience. The 
cameras zoomed into to record her expression to the declaration. &quot;I 
just...err...I was serious about college.&quot; The interviewer chuckled 
gleefully, practically smelling the rapidly soaring ratings.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eric chimed in, &quot;I remember her mentioning once that they used 
to call her &#39;Prince&#39; as a nickname back in high school. I guess like the 
music artist?? She never liked to talk about it though.&quot; Utena&#39;s eyebrow 
twitched slightly as she noted the small smirk on Eric&#39;s face as she 
raised an eyebrow at her in challenge to argue. It would seem Eric was 
paying her back for a few things now that they had reached the end. 
Sighing Utena gave a small nod to confirm.

&quot;Hmm. It was a long time ago. I don&#39;t really like to go by it now.&quot;

&quot;My! Prince Utena! And its something the fans can surely see, is it 
not?&quot;

&quot;Err.&quot;

The audience gave an enthusiastic agreement. Utena&#39;s eye twitched 
slightly in exasperation. Somewhere backstage Anthy was waiting and 
probably laughing right now. So were the rest of the duelists no doubt. 
That thought alone made her put her forehead in her hand. She hated 
looking foolish in front of Juri-senpai...san. Not to mention giving 
ammunition for Touga&#39;s teasings later. Good lord. Can we hurry this up 
please? And if that girl in the front row cat calls any louder, I think 
they&#39;ll have to call in animal control. The ex-Champion of the duels 
thought in embarrassment.

Finally they seemed to let up and get back to the point, Mason taking 
the lead again. &quot;After one of our shows, we decided to bar hop a bit and 
drag her along. She needed to get out more and we were all in a good 
mood. At one point we went to a bar with karaoke, so we all took turns 
and managed to get even Utena hammered enough to get the guts to go on 
stage. She was completely wasted...she could barely even stand! And then 
she opened her mouth and like...this voice came out that gave me 
chills.&quot;

If Utena turned any pinker, the audience wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell 
where her hair stopped and her face began. That time at the bar when she 
had sang for the first time...it hadn&#39;t been by the Sword&#39;s influence. 
As embarrassing as it was, that had actually been her singing. Right now 
she wanted to melt into the floor as she heard a guy stand up in the 
audience and shout loudly: &#39;She give me chills too!&#39;.

Without the Swords in her body lending her their seductive stoicism and 
unnatural calm, she was more human now. The audience seemed to be taking 
it in a sort of awe. Their metal idol was so different now...so much 
more real. She really wasn&#39;t &#39;Ten&#39; anymore... Maybe that was a good 
thing? Or maybe not. But she certainly was something new. But for the 
band members of Crysanthium Ecstasy that was a good thing, according to 
the smiles and casual way they patted her on the back and shoulders. 
Utena was back. She was finally back!

The interviewer went over her notes as a cue for a commercial break came 
and went and the interview continued with future plans for the band. The 
band would continue, under Jared&#39;s direction just as it had been in the 
past. Eric and Violet would take turns stepping up to the mic now and 
then, but primarily Jared would be Crysanthium&#39;s new lead instead of 
purchasing outside talent. They wanted to keep their family together as 
much as possible, and not chance losing the integrity of their sound 
again.

The questions finally began to draw to a close, the effort taking its 
toll on them all.

&quot;So finally Utena-san...your amnesia. You&#39;ve stated that you&#39;ve regained 
your memories, something your fans had been praying for since the 
beginning of your career. Does this have anything to do with the major 
police incident at Crysanthium Ecstasy&#39;s last concert? And your decision 
to leave the band?&quot;

Utena&#39;s face became serious, her robin&#39;s egg eyes turning to address the 
cameras and audience directly, ignoring the woman seated next to her.

&quot;The last concert we played was a turning point for us all, I believe. 
It really struck home how we&#39;ve changed since we&#39;d begun our journey and 
the sort of person I, myself, had become. Our fans have supported us 
loyally throughout all of this...so it really hurt me to see that things 
had gotten so out of control and many people were hurt in the riot. And 
I blame myself.&quot;

Touga, using his connections, had managed to filter a story throughout 
the media. The concert, it was now being reported, got out of control 
with the heavy alcohol being served during the event. And a minor 
incident broke out within the crowd when a man lit a tee-shirt stand on 
fire. A fight broke out between the vendors, the lie went on, and this 
was quickly expanded into the audience itself. The crowd became a mob, 
and like following the Pied Piper, went out on a march after the band to 
an underground concert being held by them at an abandoned school several 
miles away. A publicity stunt that had gone awry. Several reports were 
being filed and numerous individuals were being interrogated with their 
involvement in the mayhem.

Or at least that is what everyone was being told. The actual truth was 
being carefully concealed by higher ups.

&quot;Crysanthium Ecstasy has gone away from its roots, and our latest 
performances have gotten out of hand. Mainly under my influence. So I&#39;m 
going to retire and sort things out with my life. I think that from this 
point, they as group can finally get back and focus on what&#39;s really 
important: the music.&quot; Utena replied politically. The interviewer 
nodded, glancing at the band members who were fidgeting slightly. There 
was a cough from Jared. There had initially been arguments about her 
leaving, but they were mainly out of guilt and loyalty. It was time 
Utena had left, and she knew it.

&quot;I see. And your memories?&quot;

Utena smiled at the question. &quot;They&#39;ve returned. The incident was all so 
shocking and exciting that it must have triggered something. So I&#39;m 
finally heading back home to get my new life underway.&quot; Her honestly 
happy smile made several other people smile too. The interviewer sighed 
and remarked wryly.

&quot;You&#39;ll be very much missed. I must admit to being a big fan as well.&quot;

Utena leaned over to pat her on the hand. &quot;Well thank you very much! 
That makes me happy...I hope you&#39;ll continue to support my friends. And 
if you consider it, its not like I&#39;m dying. Who knows what the future 
holds? &quot;

The woman in her mauve suit and perfect makeup perked up and asked 
cheerily, &quot;Oh? Is there a possibility for a return to the music scene?&quot; 
Utena smiled and looked up to the ceiling, seeing beyond it to the 
wonderful new things waiting for her.

&quot;Who knows?&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Backstage, the band were split up amongst themselves and their various 
agents. Talking and discussing schedules and what else they had to do 
for the week. Utena remained alone, her agent already transferred to 
someone else. The finalization of her paperwork being done behind closed 
doors and over the phone. There was still some loose ends to tie up, but 
now she was...just Utena again. Looking over wistfully at the members of 
her band...her old band...she gave a small sigh and put her hands in her 
pockets.

Alone she walked over to a small banquet table with fruit and snack 
food, and past it to where a woman with dusky skin like cinnamon and 
hair that trailed down past her lower back waited. Utena stopped just 
before her and smiled silently. Anthy smiled back and extended a vase of 
carefully arranged white roses. &quot;For you. To celebrate your retirement.&quot;

Taking the vase, still not touching Anthy, Utena carefully looked them 
over before giving a nod of acceptance. &quot;I promise not to throw these 
away.&quot; She grinned when Anthy gave a small frown and gave her a soft 
slap on the arm.

&quot;You better not! Those were expensive! Honestly...&quot;

But she was cut off as Utena leaned over and kissed her, carefully 
holding the vase to the side. Parting, Utena leaned back on her heels 
again, quietly spoke without looking at Anthy.

&quot;...And beautiful.&quot;

Surprised at first, Anthy&#39;s expression softened as she moved to embrace 
the taller woman and lean her head on her shoulder. &quot;No. You are.&quot; For a 
moment they stood there, wrapped in the glow of warmth that seemed to 
envelope them.

They began walking to the back stage exit, when a soft cough made the 
pause. Glancing over their shoulders, they found Violet and the rest of 
the band arranged in a group behind them. Surprised Utena turned fully 
as Violet scuffed her boot into the floor and looked up hesitantly into 
her eyes.

&quot;...Utena? I didn&#39;t want you to leave before I said goodbye. There was 
something I wanted to tell you, before I...lost the chance.&quot; She took a 
deep breath, her hands tightening into fists as she gazed back at the 
woman determinedly. Her short black hair kept falling into her eyes, and 
her gothic-print skirt was ruffled from the nervous twisting of her 
hands earlier.

&quot;I like you! Will you please go out with me?!&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes opened with surprise as her eyebrows met her hairline at 
the forceful declaration from the normally mousy girl. Anthy hid a 
giggle behind her hand. Regaining her composure, Utena straightened as 
she put her hands on her hips, and looked Violet in the eyes. Seriously 
regarding her.

&quot;You&#39;ve gotten a lot braver somehow. A long way from the Violet I first 
knew...&quot;

Violet bit her bottom lip. &quot;I had someone to show me how.&quot;

Utena nodded, their gazes locked as the other band members looked from 
one to the other as they watched the exchange.

&quot;I see. And I completely reject!&quot; Jared nearly fell over in shock as 
Utena shrugged nonchalantly.

&quot;A-Ah hey, t-thats a bit much, yeah?&quot; He exclaimed nervously. But Violet 
was smiling and completely fine.

&quot;I know. But I wanted to say it anyway. Because I needed to get it out.&quot; 
Utena smiled as she nodded with pride. Coming over she swept the small 
girl into a big hug, spinning her once before setting her back down 
again. Not letting go.

&quot;I see great things for you. And I can tell you&#39;re going to do just fine 
out there. Knock &#39;em dead, kiddo.&quot; Violet looked up at her then, her 
composure finally cracking as she buried her face into Utena&#39;s chest and 
tightly returned the hug to hide her tears. Jared wistfully came over to 
clap Anthy&#39;s shoulder companionably, startling the graceful woman.

&quot;Hey hey. You better take care of our girl now. She&#39;s got a mess of big 
bros and sissys watching out for her now, love. Ya bloody well best make 
her the happiest woman on earth, cause we&#39;ll badger you if you don&#39;t. 
Make with lots of the lovey-dovey.&quot;

&quot;And the sex!&quot;

&quot;Right-o Lance. Lots of the sex too. Poor girl probably ain&#39;t been laid 
in who knows how long, and I can tell ya from past experiencin&#39;s that 
its ruddy awful to deal with!&quot; Jared chimed in, dead serious. Utena 
punched him hard in the back of the head, face aflame.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, idiots!! Come on Anthy, lets go!&quot; Utena, mortified, 
grasped her hand and pulled her along and tried to ignore the laughter 
that followed them. Especially the knowing chuckle of Anthy.

As they strode out of the studio building, they turned back one last 
time to gaze at the silhouettes lining the doorway that watched them 
leave. Eric cupped her hands to her mouth and called out: &quot;We won&#39;t let 
you be a stranger, Tenjou! Come karaoke with us next time we&#39;re in 
town!&quot;

Lifting a hand in a parting wave, Utena grinned and turned back to face 
the bright sun that lit up the blue empty sky. Lacing her fingers with 
Anthy&#39;s, she placed a welcomed kiss on top of her head as she took the 
lead again.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home, Anthy. We have a lot to catch up on.&quot;

And disappearing into the new day, a bright future that beckoned to them 
invitingly, the two women moved forward into the world.
