The world slowly appeared in a growing slit of light as Utena Tenjou 
opened her eyes from behind her helm. Internally, gears started to whir, 
her mechanical heart clicked constantly as it pumped red lifeblood 
through the various channels and avenues of her body. Her blue glowing 
eyes began to scan her surroundings as her internal memory drives booted 
up and began to register the input of data. As her pupil lens contracted 
and whirred in and out of focus, her scanners showed all signs as 
normal. She took a step forward, and listening to her joints creak and 
crack back into place quietly. She had remained standing by the window 
all night.

The tall female cyborg, made taller by the enhanced ecto-suit she wore, 
wore a confused frown to her lips. And had ever since the dinner, 
unbeknownst to her Princess. The dinner had been...unexpectedly calm. 
She shook her hair free, as the pink haired knight took off her helmet. 
She reached down to adjust her grieve, her thoughts continuing on 
unheeded. King Ohtori...&#39;Akio&#39; he asked her to call him, had been 
nothing but the kind hearted doting brother. Seeing to their needs, 
acting like a gracious host. Of course, Utena wasn&#39;t fooled. Nothing was 
that simple, and she recalled the look he had given them when they had 
met in the Throne Room. His sudden change of heart had to be some 
ploy...right? Of course. She mustn&#39;t lose her focus. Whether or not Akio 
was really sincere with his sister was not the issue.

What was, was her complete lack of respect and status amongst the court. 
It had taken a sharp word to make the nobles in the hallway bow properly 
towards their newly established monarch. And even then it had been 
mocking. That would need to be corrected. But their customs were strange 
here... On the way back, after the private dinner with the King and his 
lovely young wife Kanae, Utena had noticed several peculiarities.

For example, while passing by the kitchens, she saw a servant look up at 
her in utter terror and make a strange sign with his hand. This happened 
several times, with various other workers within the castle. All had a 
near frenzied look of fear and adoration. One had addressed her as 
&#39;Kaiathi un Dios&#39;. She was baffled by this. But of course she remained 
silent and gave a polite nod of her head.

Upon returning to her apartments, and instructing Anthy to retire, she 
found to her suspicion small trinkets lining her doorway. Tiny 
delicacies wrapped in wide odd-shaped leaves. What looked to be some 
sort of unidentified talismans, with weird markings and patterns made of 
yarn worked within. There was a wooden medallion carved with a crude 
rose, like the one on her breastplate. And several candles and sticks of 
incense were burning. She had deftly put out the candles with a stomp of 
her boot, and stuck the incense in a flower vase. The rest of the items 
were swept into her doorway to lie abandoned in the corner. Odd 
practices. The food was probably poisoned. No doubt they were jealous 
and fearful because she was a high-ranking military official from past 
wars gone by, and were concerned about her unknown presence within their 
realm. Odd people...especially since her old commander Dios had been 
dead now for nearly two thousand years. His contributions to society 
must have been so worthwhile, that even now they remembered him as a 
hero. The thought made her smile with fierce pride.

And then of course...had been the...nightly intruder...

After returning from her nightly patrol about the hallways connected to 
the Princess&#39; apartments, Utena had returned to her locked room...only 
to find a girl waiting for her.

Waiting for her in her bed...

Clad only in a nightshift...

And claiming she had &#39;come to keep the great Guardian warm on such a 
cool night&#39;.

Said girl had been quickly deposited without ceremony out her doorstep. 
The lock had been firmly re-latched, and a chair had been placed under 
the lock. Utena&#39;s eyebrow twitched. Young servant girls with skeleton 
keys were...disconcerting.

Utena sighed and paced. She had been asleep for two thousand years, 
according to Anthy&#39;s statement. Her body, back in her old life, had been 
augmented with a state-of-the-art cyborg enhancement. She had been 
implemented into the Guardian Program, had been imputed with a new 
protocol and was prepared to take her place as the next in a long line 
of soldiers who served the family of militaristic royals. But even 
throughout her years as a cadet, her harsh training and upbringing...she 
kept her habit of pacing when in thought.

Her boots thumped quietly on the carpet, back and forth as her mind went 
over the agenda for the day. She still needed to find out the economic 
situation of this kingdom. Her directives were clear:

Once awakened from cry-sleep by one of Dio&#39;s line, she would protect 
that individual. The individual had been female, and was therefore a 
Princess. A Prince could have awoken her, but the program dictated that 
the blood of a female from that genealogy would be more potent and 
readable, due to the various contagions and diseases running rampant 
during her time.

Which...may no longer be the case now? The males all seem healthy...I 
suppose after two thousand years, the chemical weapons would have ceased 
to be a threat...but...

Second: Her directive was to assess the situation of her new Charge&#39;s 
status. The sensors in the scanner were brain-rods. Slang within her 
unit, for the sensitive drivers that were able to read the electronic 
pulses within the human mind. Able to decode the memories stored there. 
The A.I. system would determine if the subject was worthy enough, based 
on past actions and the encrypted code that master Dios himself had 
created. If she awoke, that meant the system judged her to be of good 
character and of the potential to be a strong leader to her people. It 
was the Guardian&#39;s duty to make it so.

But seeing her like that...Anthy...she seems to have been treated 
cruelly. And she said she&#39;s been used as a &#39;plaything&#39; around the 
castle. That isn&#39;t right. Not at all.

Utena&#39;s white gloved clenched tightly into a fist. She felt a hot flare 
of anger rise within her, pushing past the neutral calm of her 
mechanical enhancements.

Girls should not be treated in such a way. Not if they aren&#39;t 
&#39;designated whores&#39;. To merely use someone in such a way is utterly 
disgusting. The men here are no better than the dogs back home...

That thought gave her pause. But she brushed away her sudden pang of 
loneliness and uncertainty. Her mind refocused.

Three: She was to assess the situation of her Charge&#39;s nation-state. 
Which now apparently was merely a backwater kingdom. A tiny spat of 
civilization no bigger than the smallest town back in her own world. The 
population had been sliced drastically since the war...what had happened 
back then? But no...that was not important. Her directives had to be 
completed. She was a soldier at heart, and a soldier did what she was 
told. She wouldn&#39;t fail her old commander in this.

It was his wish that the Guardian program be used as a means to insure 
peace a security for him and his people. And besides...I...

That thought was brushed away as well.

Four: She was to destroy any enemy who should stand as an obstacle to 
her charge&#39;s path. Ultimate force would be used, if necessary, should 
her Charge&#39;s territory be overrun with war and enemies. All tactics 
would be used should there be a shortage of supplies or a decline in the 
health of the populace.

Five: In the event, her Charge is not in power, the Guardian was to 
assess the current power and judge if they are worthy to retain it. To 
simply kill the leading monarch to put her Charge in power, might lead 
to an uprising. Instead, the Guardian would observe, and if the leading 
monarch was unfit to lead his people (if he too is of Dio&#39;s blood) then 
that political leader would be carefully disposed. Her Charge would be 
maneuvered into power.

But...she had lost her temper...she had stated things out in the open. 
An error. She shouldn&#39;t have done that. But she had been so angry seeing 
those disgusted eyes look upon her Princess! And had been so angry to 
see the complete disregard they had been given by the higher-ups at that 
large table.

Now they knew her purpose. It would not be subtle. It would now be 
riskier and more dangerous. She was such an idiot...

Utena sighed miserably and thunked her head against the wall by the 
window. Dios, had he still been alive, would have surely reprimanded her 
for this. She really wasn&#39;t good at such things...politically 
speaking...

And being &#39;subtle&#39;, despite her best efforts in the past, had never been 
successful. Her old drill sergeant had said it was because she was too 
thick headed. Unfit to be in the Abraxas Military Squadron. And 
certainly unfit to be made a cadet to the Guardian program. She was a 
woman, she was quick to temper, and she didn&#39;t have the hard endurance 
of a man. &#39;She would always be looked at as inferior to her fellow 
cadets&#39;, they had taunted her. Indeed, at the time...she...hadn&#39;t known 
why she was chosen in the first place...it had been strange. But she had 
born the hazing and the ridicule...had done her best to be worthy to be 
a possible candidate for being selected as the next Guardian in line, 
should the current one fall in the line of duty. She had had no way to 
have known the events that would have brought her to where she was 
now...had no way to know...

Her eyes squeezed shut in pain. She had to be better than this. She 
couldn&#39;t afford to be emotional. The population regarded her as...as 
some sort of higher power. Almost as if she were a deity. Was that the 
meaning of the offerings outside her door last night? It seemed 
ridiculous that she should be regarded as such, but it did explain a 
great deal. However, they didn&#39;t realize the truth of her situation, and 
Anthy didn&#39;t either. If she knew...would she...still accept her in her 
role? Thoughts of Anthy filled her mind as she tugged her helm back on.

It was morning. It was time to face the day. For now she merely had to 
protect her Princess, as the program dictated. Observe the situation. 
Make sure that no wars happened on her watch. Keep the peace, like a 
good little officer. Try not to remember how Anthy had looked in that 
dress...

She halted in her pacings. Where had that thought come from? Ung, that 
maid incident was probably still getting to her. She rapped her knuckles 
gently against her head. 

Focus Utena...time to be the silent hulking giant. 

She took a breath and cleared her mind. She allowed the robotic 
neutrality to settle over her, controlling her emotions. When she was 
all business again, she belted on her sword and opened the door.

Only to have a brown haired maid come flying into her arms.

&quot;Ah! My Lord Guardiaaaaaaaan! Good morning to you!&quot; It was by sheer 
force of will and extremely heavy boots that Utena didn&#39;t fall on her 
rump. Tackling a metal breastplate...you would think that would deter 
most amorous pursuits. Utena sighed and tried to remain cool. She needed 
to uphold her image. And the mask made it much easier.

&quot;Pardon me, Miss Shinohara.&quot;

&quot;Oh please. Call me Wakaba, holy one!&quot;

&quot;...Wakaba...kindly remove your hands from my belt.&quot;

Wakaba pouted cutely, her brown bobbing ponytail bouncing behind her 
head. &quot;Hmph, why must you go about in that stuffy old armor? You&#39;re the 
Guardian! You should wear something more comfortable.&quot;

Utena&#39;s brow twitched in annoyance. &quot;And you should please stop trying 
to undo my belt.&quot;

Wakaba beamed a cheerful smile and finally stepped back. She had almost 
managed to sneak her hands around too! She gave a curtsy, which just so 
happened to show off her cleavage through the loosened drawstrings of 
her servant&#39;s dress. Utena fought the urge not to groan.

The white knight tapped her foot impatiently as she waited for the maid 
to hurry up and leave. She didn&#39;t have time for this. Wakaba seemed to 
sense her impatience. She motioned to the pile of trinkets and offerings 
outside Utena&#39;s door. Looking down she felt her brows knit. More of 
them...wonderful...

&quot;Shall I bring these into your quarters, holy one? I will be humbly in 
charge of cleaning your room this day.&quot; Funny, but that excited twinkle 
in her eye didn&#39;t seem very &#39;humble&#39; to her readings...

Utena sighed out loud finally, feeling exasperated. &quot;Very well, go 
ahead. And leave my visor alone please.&quot; Wakaba shrugged and didn&#39;t 
waste a moment. She deftly scooped up the growing pile of trinkets and 
moved them and the candles inside. Excited to investigate the Mysterious 
Mechanical Knight&#39;s room no doubt. Utena didn&#39;t really care. She didn&#39;t 
have any possessions anyway.

Freed from obligation, she had taken several steps down the corridor 
before she paused as a thought hit her. That was the first time...she 
had been treated normally by anyone here. That made her feel a 
bit...nice. The girl was overly energetic (wastefully so) and had a bad 
habit of throwing herself all over the knight. But she was friendly, and 
hadn&#39;t hesitated to talk to her. Compared to the rest of the castle&#39;s 
staff, it was a definite improvement. It had only been a day...but she 
had already found herself weary of all the attention.

I wasn&#39;t cut out to be a leader...and I hate politics.

Utena strode smoothly down the short span of stone hallway and rapped on 
Anthy&#39;s door. There was an answer within, and Utena opened it to step 
inside. Her breath hitched. Hand still grasping the door handle, she 
looked on as Anthy turned away from the window to greet her. The soft 
glow of morning light played upon that amber skin. It picked up the 
highlights of her hair and threw them back in a luminosity of lavender. 
She had to close her eyes a minute to regain her composure, and when she 
opened them Anthy had moved to take a seat. The odd spell broken, Utena 
shut the door and moved into the room. She was her Guardian...she needed 
to remain in control. These were abnormal thought patterns.

Taking a seat at the small dining space, Utena could see it had already 
been laid for breakfast. Sausages on a platter, fresh diced fruit in a 
gleaming silver bowl, as well as chilled juice and something made from 
eggs. There were biscuits with melted butter and honey smelling heavenly 
from a covered basket, and various meats and cheeses rested on a large 
plate. The meal looked quite sumptuous to her standards. She couldn&#39;t 
recall having ever enjoyed something like this in her past life.

She...regret having lost the need to eat.

She sat patiently as Anthy served herself. The green-eyed woman looked 
up at her with a calm smile. &quot;And how are you today, Lady Utena?&quot; She 
bent back down over her fork and knife. They were oddly shaped, Utena 
found herself thinking. Even the basic things she had taken for granted 
back then... she picked up a spare fork and inspected it.

&quot;I am well this morning Princ-&quot;

Anthy arched a brow playfully, &quot;Er, Lady Anthy.&quot; She was rewarded with a 
warm smile, that the cyborg found somewhat distracting. Anthy was 
looking much better today. There was still a weariness about her that 
was difficult to put into words, but physically she was looking much 
healthier. Utena let her internal scanners run over her Charge, and 
discerned that she was indeed correct in her assumption. Vitals signs 
showed to be in the higher margins. A couple more days and she would be 
completely well.

She responded, however, in kind. &quot;And how are you this morning, Lady 
Anthy? I trust you have slept well?&quot; Anthy looked up at her with those 
green eyes. Eyes that carried a weight to them, an intelligence that was 
nearly hidden in their depths. &quot;Yes indeed, I am feeling quite rested.&quot; 
There was a companionable silence for a moment, as Utena sat there and 
Anthy continued on with her meal. After sometime, Anthy regarded her.

&quot;Is it necessary that you wear your helm when others...aren&#39;t present?&quot; 
Utena noticed her hesitation. Her demurely arranged hands on her lap. 
The question was asked with the humbleness that came from a long time in 
subservience. Utena had witnessed its like...in another time and 
place...and found it still didn&#39;t agree with her. Besides, she was a 
Princess now. They would need to work on getting Anthy out of her shell 
slowly.

Injecting some warmth into her voice, Utena lifted her visor to peer at 
the other girl. &quot;Well, I suppose I will have no qualms about removing 
it, should my Princess ask it of me.&quot; She purposefully added the title, 
as a gentle prod. Anthy&#39;s smile deepened, and she forcibly made her 
shoulders relax and her back straighten a touch.

&quot;Then, Guardian, please remove your helm when you are in my presence.&quot;

That&#39;s my girl. You&#39;re getting better at this, Utena thought with no 
little touch of pride. With hesitation she removed the helm, with its 
bestial faceplate, and set it down beside her chair. Her hair was 
sticking up oddly.

Anthy stifled a small giggle and reached out to brush one of the errant 
locks into place. &quot;Hmmm, my Lady Knight appears to suffer from &#39;helmet 
hair&#39;.&quot; Utena smiled at the touch, and ran a self-conscious hand through 
her hair. &quot;It tends to get that way I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

Anthy covered another giggle with her hand as she returned to eating her 
breakfast. She looked up in time to catch Utena staring absently at the 
bowl of fresh fruit. Catching her gaze, Utena looked away. Anthy was 
quiet a moment before asking, &quot;Tell me...is it true you do not require 
food as...humans do?&quot;

For some reason, Anthy stumbled a touch over the word &#39;human&#39;. Utena 
vaguely wondered why. She probably felt uncomfortable in the presence of 
a cyborg. There didn&#39;t seem to be any of her kind here in Ohtori.

&quot;No, I do not require it.&quot; Utena shook her head, making her pink bangs 
get into her eyes. She brushed them back with a hand. When was the last 
time she had a haircut? Too long, she mused idly. And it wasn&#39;t like she 
was going to get one anytime soon. She was keeping her identity 
discreet. She realized Anthy was regarding her with more attention. She 
returned the eye contact.

&quot;Ah, but have you lost the desire for food?&quot;

Utena had to struggle to keep her face straight. Even so, she felt her 
eyes crease slightly. How unusually perceptive. Had she been that 
obvious? And was it her imagination, or was there...some unusual feeling 
about the woman across from her. Nothing out of the ordinary was picked 
up on her scanners. But for the first time, Utena looked into those 
cat-green eyes and wondered...if there wasn&#39;t something more to this 
person. She could almost imagine a...a...probing feeling about her mind. 
She shook off the feeling, and it disappeared. Odd.

&quot;Hmmm, I suppose I must admit that I do find the memory of 
food...nostalgic.&quot;

Anthy nodded to herself as if confirming something privately. She held 
out a large berry in offering. &quot;But have you lost the ability?&quot;

Utena thought the question over. &quot;No...I suppose I haven&#39;t, although it 
is no longer a requirement for my continued activity.&quot;

Anthy smiled warmly. &quot;Then won&#39;t you have breakfast with me?&quot;

Utena hesitated before taking the red spotted berry. She brought it up 
for inspection, but there didn&#39;t appear to be any negative readings. 
Cautiously she took a bite from it. The juice exploded over her tongue, 
drenching her palate with a sweet and wild flavor. Her eyes widened of 
their own accord. She swallowed, and closed her eyes in concentration. 
When she opened them, she couldn&#39;t seem to stop herself from grinning 
widely. &quot;...It&#39;s very good...&quot;

Anthy blushed for some reason and smiled warmly down at her plate. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad...&quot;

The observer crossed its arms as it waited inconspicuously along the 
hall. The servants were bustling about, giving a certain end of the 
Palace a wide berth. The observer cocked its head as the new &#39;Princess&#39; 
and her wind-up toy passed by in the direction of the courtyard. They 
were talking amongst themselves, the filthy witch speaking in low tones 
about something or other. The knight was nodding its head. Hmph. For 
something that was supposed to be the right hand of the great god 
himself, it sure seemed like a doll. One of those clockwork devices that 
Kaoru twin was fond of making in his study. Oh well, that Guardian&#39;s 
true power would be seen quite soon. An old acquaintance had returned to 
the castle...

Cruel lips curled into a smile, and the figure departed unseen.

Heading out a side passage of the castle, Anthy was leading them to a 
large wooden and iron structure. Utena was amazed to find themselves 
standing before a massive garden filled with carefully cultivated roses. 
Anthy had been explaining a few finer points about the Ohtori kingdom&#39;s 
defenses, as well as her current allies. But she paused as they neared 
the rose garden. Wistfully, the dark skinned girl knelt in her gown (A 
new one ordered from the Tailor&#39;s Guild apparently) and reached out her 
fingers. They brushed along the delicate petals of a red flower. Utena 
gazed about her, mentally admiring the simple outdoor green house that 
this people had managed to construct given their materials. It was 
gracefully ornate without being overly so. And the roses were well 
looked after. There was a pause, and then Anthy spoke in a soft voice.

&quot;Roses are the symbol of Ohtori, as I&#39;m certain you&#39;ve guessed. They are 
the symbol of our god and hold an importance amongst the nobility. Only 
the highest-ranking officials and lords may don a rose in public, or use 
the symbol for their decorations and clothing. I...I used to come here a 
lot...when I had free moments. When things seemed bleak. I&#39;ve always 
found the roses to be calming.&quot;

&quot;They are beautiful&quot;, Utena agreed. She knelt down also, and reached out 
to touch one of the roses...but stopped. Her clunky metal gloves got in 
the way. She retracted her hand, but it was caught in both of Anthy&#39;s 
own. Utena held her breath as Anthy gazed deeply into her eyes. For a 
moment, neither spoke a word. Anthy delicately held Utena&#39;s wrist, and 
slowly unclipped the glove. When her hand was bare, Anthy threaded her 
fingers among the knight&#39;s own and gave her a small squeeze. A flush 
heated Utena&#39;s cheeks, as she remained unmoving. Safely unseen behind 
her visor. Anthy moved their hands toward the rose Utena had avoided 
touching earlier, and slowly removed her hand. She guided the blue-eyed 
cyborg&#39;s hand around the fragrant blossom. And took her hands away.

Utena gazed down at the rose, marveling at its softness. Her fingers 
gently traced a petal, as Anthy&#39;s had done earlier and felt that sense 
of regret once more. Only once before...had she ever been this close to 
a flower...

Anthy parted her lips as if to ask something, but was cut off as an 
all-too-familiar voice cut sharply across the distance.

&quot;Well well, the heathen witch dares to show her face I see. I think 
punishment is required here.&quot;

Anthy stood up hastily, only a second behind Utena. The White Knight&#39;s 
glove was already replaced and her sword was drawn. The cyborg felt a 
hate slowly sear its way through her veins. Her eyes flowing like twin 
blue embers through the eye slots of her mask, Utena stepped 
protectively in front of Anthy.

&quot;Well well, the green haired pig comes squealing back to its master.&quot;

Saionji snarled in anger, striding forward and drawing his sword. Utena 
moved to meet him. But both were halted.

&quot;Sir Tenjou, please do not engage in this! There are rules!&quot;

&quot;Kyouichi, please calm down...Anthy is now recognized as the king&#39;s only 
sister. To harm her would make our king most displeased.&quot;

Utena felt her anger cool in bemusement as she recognized the red haired 
playboy from the evening before. He gave a bow to indicate his 
acknowledgement of them both. &quot;Greetings Great Guardian. Greetings 
Princess Anthy. Please pardon my lord general&#39;s behavior, he has had a 
most difficult time returning to us.&quot;

&quot;It is all that bastard&#39;s fault! I&#39;ll kill him for such humiliation! How 
dare they take control of my men?&quot;

Touga&#39;s smile remained, but his gaze turned serious. &quot;Saionji...this is 
the holy Knight Of The Mountain...the being from legends and scripture. 
Surely you do not mean disrespect and are merely tired from your 
journey. I would advise you rest and have something to eat.&quot;

Saionji jerked his shoulder out of his fellow&#39;s grasp, turning to him.

&quot;I meant every word. I am not a coward like you, Kiryuu. I fear nothing 
on this earth, and I do not think this &#39;Holy Knight&#39; to be anything but 
some concoction of that witch!&quot; He stabbed an angry finger in Anthy&#39;s 
direction. Anthy had gone into a kind of stillness, her face blank of 
any emotion. Utena could feel her anger beginning to gnaw away once more 
at her gut. Her fist tightened on the sword.

&quot;Why you son of a-&quot;

Anthy tightened her grip on the armored arm she was clinging to. &quot;Please 
Sir Tenjou...an open act of violence is punishable by the king...you are 
the Guardian, and of course no one would fault you...but...please...for 
my sake...&quot;

Utena sighed harshly. She eased up her sword, but didn&#39;t put it away. 
&quot;Then tell that fool to go on his way, before I give him a new hole to 
breathe through.&quot;

Saionji heard this a blustered. &quot;You demon! Familiar of evil 
workings...I challenge you to a duel!&quot;

Kiryuu&#39;s eyebrows rose in surprise, and Anthy paled. A duel...the 
challenge could not be revoked. And the consequences could be serious. 
There were certain magiks involved...of which Utena didn&#39;t know.

But it was far too late. For she didn&#39;t even hesitate in sealing the 
deal.

&quot;I accept.&quot;

That was when she felt a cord of power crackle about her body. In wary 
confusion she flicked her gaze about, but her sensors still picked 
up...nothing. But wait...they began beeping in her skull. Something was 
wrong. There was a massive influx of energy building up. Where was it 
coming from! There she could feel it now...a near electric crackle 
through her skin, passing weakly through her special armor. Her visual 
scanner picked up nothing...but when she switched to heat readings, 
there were odd color gradients appearing like a crackling circle about 
her body. She switched back to normal visual mode, the proper lens 
sliding into place within her eye. There...still nothing. But she gave a 
harsh gasp as that crackling energy tightened roughly about her neck.

It felt like a two-way noose.

She didn&#39;t realize how right she was...
