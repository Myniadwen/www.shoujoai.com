<h1>Sailor Moon and Arisugawa Juri: Converging Paths (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Arisugawa Juri was feeling oddly pensive as she walked from the 
university to her apartment, the tall, orange haired woman oblivious to 
the beautiful day around her. Somehow she knew something was missing 
from her life, though she didn&#39;t know exactly what it was. She was so 
wrapped up in her dark thoughts that it wasn&#39;t until she neared the 
alley beside her building that she heard the sounds of a fight.
 
Looking up Juri saw several larger men fighting a slim figure in a 
schoolboy&#39;s uniform, but he was giving as good as he got. Juri was 
reminded of Miki for a moment and suddenly found herself running down 
the alley to the young man&#39;s aid. She and the sandy-blonde boy took some 
hits but Juri&#39;s dueling instincts quickly kicked in and they routed the 
young ruffians. It wasn&#39;t until then that she got a good look at her 
fighting partner and realized that it was a girl!
 
The tall young woman smiled slightly as she wiped blood from her lip 
with the back of her hand and said in a husky voice, &quot;Thanks for the 
help, even if I didn&#39;t need it.&quot;
 
Juri smiled a little skeptically, and grabbed the young woman as she 
suddenly staggered. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked worriedly.
 
The boyish young woman nodded, wincing a bit and said &quot;The kids had me 
pinned to the wall for a bit, but I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; She tried to stand on 
her own, but nearly fell before Juri caught her again. &quot;Then again, 
maybe not,&quot; the girl said with a self depreciating smile.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll bring you home and check you over,&quot; Juri said decisively. &quot;My 
first aid kit from my fencing days should have whatever I need.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re taking me home?&quot; she joked, &quot;But I don&#39;t even know your name!&quot;
 
Juri smiled back and offered her hand, &quot;Arisugawa Juri. Call me Juri.&quot; 
The young woman looked a bit surprised, but shook it heartily.
 
&quot;I&#39;m Tenoh Haruka.&quot; Haruka said with a smile.
 
They made their way to Juri&#39;s apartment, where Juri helped clean her 
cuts. Haruka asked to make a phone call, which Juri allowed, and she 
talked for a minute or so, a increasingly pained expression on her face 
as she tried to interject into a obviously one-sided lecture. Juri kept 
a polite distance but smiled as she watched. Finally, she put the phone 
down and shook her head with a smile.
 
&quot;Michiru will be here in a few minutes to pick me up.&quot; Haruka looked 
worried for a moment and asked, &quot;Is it all right I gave this address? I 
know a lot of people are concerned about privacy.&quot;
 
Juri shook her head with a smile. &quot;You know, I never even considered 
that you might be less than honest.&quot; She gave Haruka a measuring look. 
&quot;But you seem very up-front and true to yourself. Trust worthy, even.&quot;
 
Haruka looked a bit embarrassed, but they were interrupted by a car 
pulling in at high speed. Juri stood up, helping Haruka up from the 
couch, and showed her to the window. A girl with short blue hair was 
driving, and a beautiful girl with green hair was getting out, very 
quickly and with a worried expression on her face.
 
Juri helped her open the window and Haruka yelled, &quot;I&#39;ll be right down!&quot; 
The green haired woman looked concerned but waved her agreement. Juri 
locked up her suite and helped Haruka downstairs. As soon as they went 
out Haruka was instantly in the green haired girl&#39;s bone-crushing hug. 
The blue haired girl walked over , introduced herself as Ami and asked 
her to excuse her friend as she had assumed the worst. Juri was stunned 
and had to take a moment to respond as it was like she was being 
confronted by Miki&#39;s female twin. After a few moments, the pair 
separated and the green haired girl noticed the stranger.
 
&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, looking Juri over, &quot;I understand you helped Haruka. 
Thank you,&quot; she said respectfully, &quot;I&#39;m Kaioh Michiru.&quot; Juri smiled and 
shook hands, introducing herself, and accepting an invitation to stop by 
at their place and check up on Haruka. Haruka climbed stiffly into the 
car and waved as they left.
 
A few days later Juri was volunteering at the recreation center when 
they all met again. She taught a one night a week swordsmanship class 
and had several very promising students., including a girl named Hino 
Rei. Rei was very good, almost as good as Juri had been, and she found 
them quickly becoming friends. So she shouldn&#39;t have been so surprised 
when Rei led in three very familiar figures, all of whom seemed to 
recognize her as well.
 
Haruka and Michiru were walking over to her in a shot with enthusiastic 
greetings, Ami was a lot more reserved and Rei was laughing quietly in 
the background. Juri was still a bit shaken by Ami, so she kept her 
distance.
 
&quot;And here I was planning to introduce you to my so cool fencing teacher, 
and you already know her!&quot; Rei tried to look fierce, but she couldn&#39;t 
keep it up. Juri laughed and explained how they met, Haruka casually 
mentioned that she used to be pretty good at fencing and in moments they 
were in gear and a match was under way. Rei had jokingly threatened 
Haruka if she hurt Juri, bringing a smile to Juri&#39;s face but she was 
completely serious in the match.
 
As the foil blades crossed, it was like she was back with the duelists 
and she fought with aggression and strength, soon lost in the rhythm of 
parry and thrust. In moments a very surprised Haruka was disarmed and 
Juri reflexively swiped a imaginary rose from her chest with the point 
of her blade. Rei and her friends were standing there stunned, then 
Michiru rushed to help Haruka up, and Juri came back to herself.
 
She apologized to Haruka but the young woman laughed it off and asked 
Juri to show her the move she had used to disarm her. &quot;Juri,&quot; Rei asked 
respectfully, &quot;what was that cut across the pocket for ?&quot;
 
Juri blinked, looking a bit surprised. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said with a slight 
blush, &quot;it&#39;s a holdover from a...&quot; She took a moment to think of a good 
way to put it, &quot;A Dueling club I belonged to. We were all very good 
fighters so to make things more challenging we wore roses in our breast 
pocket. You lost your flower, you lost the duel.&quot;
 
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be hard to do with a practice sword?&quot; Ami asked.
 
Juri smiled a bit and answered seriously, &quot;If we were actually using 
practice swords, that would have been a problem.&quot; With that she got up 
quickly and walked over to check on some of the other students.
 
Ami watched her go, her mind occupied with imagining what those fights 
must have been like. It wasn&#39;t until later that she realized Juri had 
quite deliberately kept her distance from her and she wondered why.
 
Juri had always been a very solitary person as Rei, Haruka and Michiru 
realized. However, the three quickly decided to try and change that. 
They invited a slightly reluctant Juri to Rei&#39;s temple for a party, 
Haruka and Michiru hauled her to a shindig at their place and before she 
knew it she was part of the gang, even snacking with them over at the 
Crown arcade. Haruka even tried to set her up with a very reluctant 
Setsuna in a blind date. Juri found she liked having friends, even if 
she did sense that they were hiding something. Still, she only got good 
vibes from all of them so she tried not to let it bother her. And 
anyway, there were things she didn&#39;t talk about as well.
 
Now Juri was having her first party at her home and she was actually 
looking forward to it. She had plenty of snacks, having seen Usagi eat 
she would probably need them, drinks, music, and she, after a bit of 
internal debate, had left her sword on the wall.
 
*Bing-Bong*
 
Juri looked up at the clock in surprise then headed to the door. &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t expecting them this early...&quot; she thought as she opened the door. 
For a moment, Juri thought she was dreaming.
 
Ami looked up at her from the doorway with a nervous smile. Her hair was 
a bit windblown, and she was wearing a boys jacket, giving her an 
uncanny resemblance to Miki. Juri gaped at her a moment, then Ami 
apologized for being so early. Juri recovered and invited her in, taking 
her jacket and hanging it up in the hall closet.
 
&quot;Juri,&quot; she said respectfully but firmly, &quot;I need to know what about me 
is bothering you so much.&quot; Juri tried to protest but Ami continued, &quot;You 
have avoided me since we first met. If I am that objectionable, I&#39;ll 
leave you alone, but I would like to know why.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami,&quot; she said with a slight flush. &quot;I guess I didn&#39;t think 
about how you were feeling.&quot; She gestured Ami to the couch and sat down 
on the other end. &quot;You resemble an old friend of mine. Same hair, same 
build, smart, you&#39;re even very courteous like him. It was a little weird 
meeting his female twin, in a way.&quot;
 
Ami nodded, then gave Juri a level gaze. &quot;There&#39;s more, isn&#39;t there?&quot; 
she asked quietly.
 
Juri looked at her a moment, blushing a bit. &quot;There was an odd chemistry 
between me and him. I was his mentor, but there was also a attraction, 
even if we never talked about it.&quot; Juri shook her head and smiled 
slightly, &quot;But it would never had worked.&quot; Ami looked at her with a 
slightly perplexed expression, and Juri added &quot;I&#39;m a lesbian, like 
Haruka and Michiru.&quot; Ami looked thoughtful for a moment, then her eyes 
widened. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Juri said with a smile, &quot;your honor is safe with 
me.&quot;
 
&quot;So,&quot; Ami said with some amusement, &quot;you&#39;ve met the double of the person 
you were once attracted to, she is the gender you prefer and you didn&#39;t 
know how to handle it so you just avoided me. Is that it?&quot;
 
Juri looked over at Ami for a moment then began to laugh. Hearing it all 
spelled out in such logical and reasonable terms made her see how silly 
she had been. In a moment they were both laughing long and hard, the odd 
tension between them gone. It wasn&#39;t long after that the others began to 
arrive and the party really got going.
 
It was pretty funny when the dancing started, as all of the girls took 
turns dancing with Haruka, her leading them across the living room 
floor. Finally she pled exhaustion, not to mention wanting to dance with 
Michiru and Ami walked over to a surprised Juri asking with a smile, 
&quot;Juri, do you know how to lead?&quot;
 
Juri smiled and rose out of her chair, silently taking Ami&#39;s dare. They 
moved gracefully across the floor together as the others watched in 
surprise. Finally, Juri ended her waltz with Ami with an exaggerated dip 
to everyone&#39;s enjoyment. After that she and Haruka took turns waltzing 
them around the room.</pre>
