<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound (part 3 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>With the setting of the sun, the creatures of the night stirred from 
their daytime rest. Owls hooted, bats took wing, rats scurried, wolves 
howled their lonely cries, and in and around Ohtori Academy, the 
vampires awakened.

Touga sighed softly to himself, holding out his goblet to one of his 
pretty little serving girls. There were dozens of them, all sweet 
young things he had brought here by the force of his will alone. &quot;Fill 
it up,&quot; he ordered her softly.

The nude girl paced towards where Touga was sitting, holding out her 
arm over the rim of the glass. She took a barber&#39;s razor and gently 
drew it over a barely healed scar. Redness welled up, and then flowed 
into the glass.

Touga watched the glass fill even as she began to sway in place. She 
grew pale, and as a last few drops of her precious blood fell, she 
collapsed limply backwards. He took a small drink from his glass, 
swirling the liquid around in his mouth, savoring the sweet taste and 
ignoring the body laying on the floor nearby.

Finally, Touga pretended to notice her, and said to the other girls, 
&quot;If she&#39;s still alive, bandage up her arm. If she&#39;s dead, toss her out 
with the rest.&quot; The serving girls dragged her away, leaving a small 
streak of blood on the floor in their wake.

The mad vampire, Saionji, scrambled out from his corner, lapping at 
the mess on the clean floor. Touga reached out to pat his filthy mop 
of hair as he laughingly said, &quot;Good doggie.&quot; Saionji whined out his 
happiness.

But that momentary feeling of pleasure quickly faded, and Touga was 
left only with his own troubling thoughts.

&#39;It was far too easy,&#39; Touga thought grimly, &#39;to dominate these 
cattle. I need to find a new challenge.&#39; He smiled slightly, thinking 
of Tenjou Utena. &#39;She&#39;s beautiful, so fierce, and her will is as 
strong as any I have met. No wonder Lord Akio wanted her! If I could 
take her,&#39; he mused, &#39;it would be truly glorious.&#39;

&quot;Will you try to take Utena?&quot; the smooth voice asked, almost as if 
it&#39;s owner had read his very thoughts. Touga turned, frowning, to see 
Juri standing there behind him.

&quot;I haven&#39;t decided,&quot; Touga lied to her smoothly.

She smiled slightly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying it, Kiryuu.&quot; Juri 
smiled, a hint of white fang showing, &quot;I think she&#39;d be too much for 
you, boy.&quot;

He hissed, his own fangs gleaming, but she just laughed, walking away. 
Saionji tried to stop her, and she kicked him aside like the dog he 
now was.

Juri strode down the hallway, deep in thought. &#39;Hopefully, he&#39;ll try 
to attack Utena,&#39; she thought with a grim smile, &#39;She&#39;ll kill him 
easily, of course, and my primary rival for the ladies of Ohtori will 
be gone.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nanami pressed herself against the wall, trying to get away from him. 
&quot;Please,&quot; she cried out, &quot;you don&#39;t want to do this!&quot;

Tsuwabuki just smiled at her, his white fangs gleaming in the lamp 
light. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of you, Nanami,&quot; he sighed out to her dreamily, 
&quot;just like your brother. I&#39;ll keep you safe.&quot; He took another half 
step forward, his eyes gleaming madly.

Tsuwabuki&#39;s school uniform was shabby, badly torn, far different than 
how he had once looked. But what he was now had very little in common 
with what he had once been, the handsome young boy with the bright 
future ahead.

&quot;No,&quot; Nanami softly whimpered, almost trying to go through the wall 
itself to attempt to get away from the vampire.

A startled look passed over his face, and Nanami cried out as 
something burst out of his chest, spraying her with foul smelling 
gore.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Utena said, using the flagpole she stabbed him with to pin 
the small boy&#39;s writhing body down to the floor. She knelt, staked the 
creature&#39;s heart, and he stopped struggling. Utena looked up, seeing 
the shell shocked look on the young girl&#39;s face. It was something she 
had grown used to seeing, here at Ohtori.

Nanami spat several times, trying to get something out of her mouth. 
&quot;He used to be a nice kid,&quot; she said softly, a tear trickling down as 
she looked at the boy&#39;s body.

Utena noticed that some of the gore covering Nanami had gotten into 
her mouth, too. &quot;Better wash out your mouth when you shower,&quot; she 
advised her, picking up Tsuwabuki and putting him over her shoulder. 
&#39;I don&#39;t know if you can become a vampire accidentally swallowing the 
blood,&#39; she thought, &#39;and I don&#39;t want to find out.&#39;

It didn&#39;t take Utena much time to gather the firewood. She did it with 
as much dignity as she could manage, giving poor Tsuwabuki a silent 
prayer before she set his remains ablaze. She watched the flames, the 
body becoming ash, lost in her own troubling thoughts.

&quot;Poor child,&quot; Utena heard a woman say from just a little ways behind 
her, &quot;I don&#39;t think he was ever suited to this life.&quot;

Utena quickly turned around to see Juri standing there, looking into 
the fire thoughtfully. The rising flames lit up her orange hair, and 
seemed to give the color of life back to her bone pale skin. She 
looked beautiful standing there in the firelight.

Utena toyed with the stake she held in her hand. &quot;Something I can do 
for you, Juri?&quot; she asked her softly, ready for any attack that she 
might bring.

&quot;I&#39;d like to help you, Utena,&quot; Juri said to her pleasantly. She took a 
careful step towards her, smiling, and a strange scent seemed to waft 
over towards her, a sweetness in the air that made Utena&#39;s teeth ache 
to be used.

&quot;How can you help me?&quot; Utena asked, trying hard to concentrate. That 
scent, it was so familiar, she should know it!

&quot;You need to accept who you are,&quot; Juri answered her softly, reaching 
out to stroke at Utena&#39;s cheek. Utena&#39;s eyes widened as she saw a 
streak of dark red along Juri&#39;s wrist, a stain slowly spreading up her 
pale arm.

Suddenly she remembered where she had smelled that before, from when 
she fed from Akio the very first time. The sweet scent of a vampire&#39;s 
blood, being freely given. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked Juri 
softly, her extended fangs making speech difficult.

&quot;A sharing,&quot; Juri said, stepping up to Utena to whisper softly into 
her ear. She felt Juri&#39;s cool body pressed against her own, she scent 
nearly overwhelming, as Juri said, &quot;Will you take my blood, Utena, so 
that I may take yours?&quot;

Utena turned and fled, but Juri followed her closely, over the roofs 
to the abandoned dorm, and to Utena&#39;s silent bedroom. Juri stood at 
the doorway, smiling at her, as a shaking Utena fought the hunger that 
surged through her. A hunger for what Juri offered her.

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Utena cried out, knowing that Juri could not come 
into the room unless Utena herself chose to invite her in.

Juri smiled sadly, shaking her head back and forth. &quot;How you deny 
yourself, Tenjou,&quot; she whispered, the softness of her voice making 
Utena listen all the harder, &quot;We are both so alone, you and I.&quot; She 
smiled, a single red tear trickling down her face and firing Utena&#39;s 
hunger even more. &quot;Could we be together, just for tonight? To not be 
so alone, anymore?&quot; she asked.

Juri extended her hand, a bit of her blood pooling in her palm, the 
scent making Utena&#39;s head spin. &#39;It doesn&#39;t have to mean anything,&#39; 
Utena thought, even as she said aloud, &quot;Come inside.&quot;

Juri was upon Utena in only a moment, pressing the pooled blood to her 
lips, then kissing her fiercely. The blood they passed back and forth 
between them just seemed to make the fevered kisses all the sweeter.

Utena felt the cut wrist pushed to her own lips, even as Juri drew 
Utena&#39;s wrist up to the wet heat of her own mouth. The taste of Juri 
was indescribable, sweet wine one moment, brandy maybe, then it simply 
dissolved into a mix of pure pleasure. They fell as one to Utena&#39;s 
bed, their bodies tangling together on top of the covers.

&#39;Now,&#39; Juri thought shortly before the pleasure whipped away all her 
rationality, &#39;now you&#39;re mine at last, sweet Utena.&#39; Then she simply 
surrendered to the feelings washing over her.

------------------------------------------------------------

Early in the morning, Utena stood alone by her window, looking out 
into the darkness that lingered here before the dawn. The naked young 
woman looked down at her wrist, the now fully healed wound a soft 
pink, and licked at her lips. A little bit of the sweetness she had 
tasted still lingered there, to tease her memory.

She walked over to her bed, looking down at the red stained sheets 
before violently tearing the bloody sheets right off the mattress. She 
concentrated on what she was doing, trying not to let herself think 
about what she had done tonight. &#39;Or how much I enjoyed tonight,&#39; 
Utena admitted to herself with a soft sigh.

What Juri had said to her when she was leaving still lingered in her 
mind.

&quot;When you&#39;re ready to accept what you are,&quot; Juri had said to her with 
a little smile, &quot;come to me.&quot; A smile stretched Juri&#39;s blood red lips 
as she seductively vowed, &quot;I&#39;ll show you pleasures that would make 
tonight seem like nothing.&quot;

Utena could feel the heaviness in her limbs, a cue that dawn was 
coming soon. She closed up the shutters, laying down on the bare bed 
for her day&#39;s rest. As she eyes closed, strangely, she found herself 
thinking about Anthy.

It was only an hour after dawn when it was found, sprawled out in one 
of the gardens. The girl&#39;s nude body was pale, drained of it&#39;s blood, 
and wounds made by a blade marked her arms. Most were long healed, but 
one still oozed a bit of pink.

Anthy knelt down, examining the body. The vampire hadn&#39;t chosen to 
bite, making his servant bleed herself for him, preventing the spread 
of the vampire curse. There was a smile on the dead girl&#39;s face, as if 
she had been happy to give of herself.

A piece of paper lay nearby, slightly stained by the little blood that 
had remained in her. Anthy picked it up to read, and a muscle in her 
jaw jumped in anger.

&quot;Tenjou Utena,&quot; it read in elegant script, &quot;Stop me if you can.&quot; And 
underneath, it was signed simply &quot;Kiryuu Touga.&quot; </pre>
