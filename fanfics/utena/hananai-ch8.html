<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 8 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>It hadn&#146;t been too long since Juri had left when Akio showed up at the 
infirmary, his sister trailing nervously behind him. The long hike 
across the eastern wing of the campus seemed to take hours, but in all 
reality, it was merely a matter of minutes. 

&quot;Anthy, I want you to tell me where she is. Remember, you&#146;ll benefit 
if you cooperate with me, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m merely the Bara no Hanayome.&quot; The Rijichou had grown angry from 
his younger sister&#146;s sudden revival of her still-fated title of the 
Bride. 

&quot;You&#146;re being very difficult, Anthy. I&#146;ll deal with you later.&quot; 
Dropping her arm, he casually walked to the front desk, where a young 
receptionist sat idly. Anthy walked a few paces and stopped, watching 
her brother step up and speak with the &#145;fresh meat&#146; he&#146;d play his role 
with.

&quot;Onii-sama; always charming to get what he wants. Why?&quot; The Bride&#146;s 
mind wandered, thinking of the many faults her brother took to his own 
advantage. One, namely being his act of charm on young girls. 
&quot;Wait...what if he...tries that with Utena-sama? Would she believe 
him?&quot; Beneath her breast, the Hanayome felt her heartbeat slam against 
her like a sledgehammer to a lone anvil. How painful it felt when 
added to the burden of mind-abusing fear. &quot;I...I won&#146;t let him! I 
can&#146;t!&quot; As Akio made his way back to her, he ran his hand through his 
hair; typical preparation for the charm act. Again, the Bride decided 
it was time to go. She turned on her heels and began to run. 

&quot;Anthy! Come back!&quot; 

&quot;No, Onii-sama, I won&#146;t let you take her from me, too!&quot; Running down 
the hall, she figured the elevator ritual would be same-old, same-old 
&quot;wait too long and get caught&quot; routine, so she took the stairs, two at 
a time, to Utena&#146;s second-floor room, only upon arrival did she notice 
the nurse changing the bed linens.

&quot;No...Utena-sama...wh-where is she...?&quot; A slender hand came to the 
Bride&#146;s mouth in eye-widening terror. Where was she? Utena was here 
this morning, right?

&quot;Oh, Tenjou-san was moved by a Seitokai&#146;s request. She&#146;s supposed to 
leave today. She&#146;s one floor up in isolation until her departure.&quot;

&quot;Oh...oh, no! He got the new information before me! Utena-sama!&quot; 
Again, Anthy&#146;s legs carried her up the stairs to the next floor, but 
now was the time for her to begin damning herself for not asking of a 
room number. Shamelessly, she invaded the privacy of many closed doors 
before finding Utena&#146;s. Once inside, she found the room empty, save 
for Utena sleeping soundly in the bed. &quot;W...what? Onii-sama...was he 
misinformed...?&quot; Behind her, the door shut, and Akio sprang to life, 
grabbing the smaller framed girl around the waist and holding her 
tight. 

&quot;Why did you run from me, Anthy? I thought you knew better than to 
disrespect me! What were you thinking?&quot; He hissed angrily between 
clenched teeth, but still managed to keep that horrifying grin.

&quot;I...can&#146;t let you take her away from me, too. I can&#146;t!&quot; Anthy&#146;s voice 
wavered in fright, but this was nothing she could lie about. 

&quot;Ohtori-Rijichou! Release her!&quot; 

&quot;Arisugawa, what are you doing here?&quot; Akio pushed the Bride to the 
floor, turning to look the poised fencer in the eyes, coldly. &quot;If you 
know what&#146;s good for you, you&#146;ll walk out that door and forget about 
what has happened here.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m afraid I cannot do that. As a Seitokai, it is my responsibility 
to view the acts that are unleashed upon the Bara no Hanayome. Your 
mistreatment of her will displease the Sekai no Hate.&quot; Akio&#146;s mouth 
twisted into an almost sadistic, know-all, grin, further angering 
Juri.

&quot;My dear, foolish, Juri, I hate to tell you how incorrect you are.&quot; He 
walked across the room to Utena&#146;s bedside, taking her by the front of 
her cotton pajama top.

&quot;What!? What the hell are you talking about!? Of course I&#146;m right!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m afraid not. The Sekai no Hate can do as it pleases in the game of 
Revolution. As the Sekai no Hate, I&#146;ll do as I please.&quot; His clenched 
fist jerked the material, hoisting the slumbering prince into 
consciousness.

&quot;You!? That&#146;s...that&#146;s impossible! You cannot be the Sekai no Hate!&quot; 
With that exclamation, Tenjou Utena was wide awake, only now realizing 
her position in the fist of Lucifer.

&quot;He...hey!! Let go!&quot; The Prince grasped Akio&#146;s strong wrists, 
struggling to make him release her.

&quot;Tenjou Utena, I&#146;m here on behalf of the Sekai no Hate to make you an 
offer.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about? What kind of an offer?&quot; Akio casually 
released Utena&#146;s clothing, taking a seat next to her on the bed, and 
placing a hand upon her leg.

&quot;I have come to ask you to trade the Dios no Chikara, and a night with 
your body to obtain it, in exchange for the freedom of the Bara no 
Hanayome.&quot;

&quot;Are you insane!? What&#146;s the catch?&quot;

&quot;None whatsoever. I merely want to save you the trouble of having the 
burden of World Revolutionization on your shoulders. This way, you 
suffer less pain and you get the Bride at no extra cost.&quot;

&quot;How can I trust you? How do I know you just won&#146;t run away with her 
and Dios if I say yes?&quot;

&quot;You have my word, Tenjou.&quot; The Prince merely turned her head, a scoff 
released.

&quot;Your word has about as much value to me as the Bara no Kokuin has for 
your worthless &#145;son&#146;. You lie! No deal!&quot; It went unnoticed by 
everyone, but Akio&#146;s eyes flashed with newborn anger as he tackled the 
girl, pinning her small form beneath his own, his left hand gripping 
her wrists tightly above her head.

&quot;I do not lie...about the rules of revolution. I am asking once more, 
surrender Dios no Chikara for the freedom of your lover...or else you 
both shall suffer.&quot; Utena stared in shock at the man above her. 
Dangerous decision to be made, but she had to make it. 

&quot;Utena-sama! Decline! It&#146;s not worth it! Surrendering Dios will 
destroy us all!&quot; Utena&#146;s ears perked as Anthy called out to her. It 
was true. The situation left the noble prince damned no matter what. 
Surrendering Dios would prove fatal...but to give herself to Akio for 
one night to be able to share another night with Anthy was all Utena 
could ever wish for, especially if she knew she were to die the 
following sunrise at least it would be with her Bride in her arms.

&quot;I have...my own offer. I will only go with this on one condition: I 
want my return duel with Shintaro. I lose, I will surrender myself and 
Dios to you. I win and I will duel to the Ends of the Earth.&quot; 
Fiendishly, Akio smiled. How could he refuse?

&quot;You drive a hard bargain, Tenjou. I accept. Shall we seal this deal?&quot;

&quot;...eh...?&quot; Akio&#146;s free-hand took Utena&#146;s slender chin, holding it in 
place as his lips claimed her own, &#145;sealing&#146; the deal with an oral 
handshake.

&quot;This is ridiculous!&quot; Juri started to make her break for Akio, but 
Anthy&#146;s arm regretfully stopped the rampaging captain in her tracks.

&quot;Don&#146;t. This is how Onii-sama gets what he wants. It&#146;s...his nature 
and it would be better if you do not interfere.&quot;

&quot;Wh...what!? Are you mad!? Look what he&#146;s doing to her!&quot;

&quot;He&#146;d...do it to anybody.&quot; Outrage. That was it. Juri was completely 
outraged. How could this girl say something so heartless about the 
girl who has practically given her life&#146;s blood to save her?

&quot;Utena is not just anybody! She loves you! How can you stand by and 
watch this happen to someone that I know you love, dearly?&quot; The 
emerald-eyed Princess choked back her tears after gazing upon the 
&#145;mental rape&#146; of her Prince. Juri was right. How could she? Upon 
releasing Utena, Akio stood up, letting his &#145;venomous&#146; tongue travel 
around his lips before turning toward the door. 

&quot;I&#146;ll be waiting...Tenjou Utena. For your sake, failure had best be 
the outcome of your return duel, for the process of me obtaining Dios 
no Chikara will be far-less painful than the process of your 
Revolutionization.&quot; And with a smile of mock satisfaction, he left the 
room in deafening silence, silence that could be penetrated with a pin 
drop. It was several more minutes before the Hanayome looked to her 
Prince, lying motionlessly in the bed, except for her heaving chest.

&quot;...no...Utena-sama...&quot; Quickly, Anthy stumbled to the bed, throwing 
herself into it and taking Utena into her arms, holding her tightly, 
yet helplessly. &quot;Please, Utena-sama, are you all right?&quot; Utena&#146;s lips 
began to move, only no sound emitted. Over and over her lips could be 
read as mouthing &#145;help me&#146; repeatedly until her volume rose into a 
shrill plea for help.

&quot;Oji-sama! Please, help me!!&quot; The cry frightened Anthy, but she still 
held tight.

&quot;Utena-sama...shhh...it&#146;s okay. It&#146;s going to be okay.&quot; Like a child, 
Utena shook in fear, like a mother, Anthy stroked the girl&#146;s cheek, 
comforting her as best as she could over her own fear.

&quot;Oh, Himemiya, what have I done? I don&#146;t know what to do! No matter 
what, I lose someone I love. I can&#146;t choose!&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama, I need you to win for me. You mustn&#146;t give up Dios. I&#146;m 
fated to be the Bara no Hanayome for the rest of my life. I can do 
nothing for this world. Dios, though, can...through you. Lose him, and 
we&#146;ll all be fated to live the way I do.&quot; Sadly enough, this girl was 
right, but did she have to be? Could Utena prove her wrong?

&quot;No, Himemiya. I won&#146;t lose you.&quot;

&quot;...but...!&quot;

&quot;I won&#146;t lose Dios, either. I&#146;ll defeat Shintaro and then I&#146;ll defeat 
the Sekai no Hate and free you. I will not lose.&quot; The Bride could say 
nothing. The nobility in her Prince overwhelmed her, greatly. Through 
this new silence, Juri approached the two.

&quot;Utena...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sempai...I&#146;m ready to start.&quot; With a relieved nod, Juri left the 
room to get Utena released. &quot;Himemiya, I can&#146;t lose as long as you 
believe in me.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Utena, I believe in you.&quot; 

Up, up, up. Arisugawa Juri leaned against the caged wall of the usual 
elevator, silhouetted in the dim light that illuminated in it. Tension 
wracked the representative ten-fold since the occurrence in Utena&#146;s 
infirmary room. A meeting of the Seitokai wasn&#146;t exactly what she 
needed now, knowing that Lucifer&#146;s &#145;son&#146; would be present. 

&quot;That boy. That boy has brought nothing but trouble. To be alone with 
him for five minutes would be all that I needed to relieve my stress.&quot; 
Tightly, her arms crossed over her chest, her hands gripping her 
sleeves as heated anger rose throughout her. &quot;Relax, Juri. It&#146;ll do me 
no good to get myself in trouble.&quot; The fencer&#146;s teeth clenched behind 
her pursed lips as her eyes snapped open and her balled fist slammed 
into the iron siding of the elevator car. &quot;Damn it all!&quot; At that time, 
the doors slid open, revealing the Seitokai-shitsu and all it&#146;s 
occupants.

&quot;Juri. You&#146;re late.&quot; Touga commented without making eye contact.

&quot;I was tending to some unfinished business.&quot; Casually, Juri uncrossed 
her arms and walked to her seat, crossing a leg over the other and 
resting her chin in her hand.

&quot;What&#146;s more important than the Seitokai?&quot;

&quot;Sekai no Hate. I was speaking with the Sekai no Hate.&quot; The captain&#146;s 
eyes remained closed, her response emotionless.

&quot;What!? How is it hat you have conversed with the Sekai no Hate?&quot;

&quot;I was tending to my business and I saw...&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa Juri, as a Seitokai, you are not to keep such important 
information secret from us. Do you wish to be removed from Seitokai?&quot;

&quot;Is that a threat, Kiryuu Touga?&quot; Upon that, silence swarmed the room 
for countless moments. Not a word was exchanged, only hard, angered 
stares from Touga.

&quot;Talk, Juri. Now.&quot;

&quot;As you wish. Through the past occurrences since Shintaro Keingo 
arrived here, there has been only turmoil. It is no coincidence that 
all this turmoil has been directed at Tenjou Utena. Upon speaking with 
the Sekai no Hate, I&#146;ve come to a decision.&quot;

&quot;What is that, sempai?&quot; Again with the silence. Kaoru Miki&#146;s voice was 
probably the calmest thing Juri has heard in quite awhile. Her 
piercing azure eyes turned to look at him for a moment. Miki, too, was 
a councilman, and a close friend. Could she really say what she was 
about to? A decision like this would be quite a change for her, should 
she keep to it. Her eyes closed. Yes, she had to.

&quot;I&#146;ve no desire to stay the representative of the Seitokai.&quot; At that, 
all eyes widened and looked to her in shock.

&quot;Se...sempai! You can&#146;t be serious!&quot; The shock in Miki&#146;s voice was all 
that could be expected. Standing quickly, stopwatch falling upon the 
tabletop. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;For me, it&#146;s quite simple. I have no desire to serve Lucifer. Or his 
&#145;son&#146;, either.&quot; The look that earned Juri&#146;s mistaken reputation 
flashed toward Shintaro. &quot;I will say it once. Surrender your title 
while you have a chance. Serving Lucifer will only get you killed.&quot; It 
was Shintaro&#146;s turn to return an angered glance, red eyes desperately 
trying to pierce through Juri&#146;s azure ones.

&quot;I won&#146;t! Akio has promised me great power once he has Dios no 
Chikara!&quot; 

&quot;He&#146;s lying! You are merely a pawn in his game, as we all are!&quot; Touga 
broke the argument upon hearing Keingo speak. &quot;How is it that you know 
about Akio? He&#146;s told me nothing of your knowledge.&quot;

&quot;You know about Akio, too?&quot;

&quot;I do, and it&#146;s foolish.&quot; Touga walked to the ledge of the 
Seitokai-shitsu and gazed upon the campus. The people below appeared 
to live normal lives in Touga&#146;s eyes. &quot;Akio. You&#146;re a fool.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about!? He&#146;s doing a lot for me! All I had to do 
was get Tenjou-kun out of the way and he&#146;d give me whatever I wanted.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s similar to what I was told.&quot; Touga muttered quietly. &quot;I cannot 
interfere with the decisions of the Sekai no Hate, despite the fact 
that I disagree.&quot; Juri came up behind him, taking a glance at him 
before resting her gaze upon the campus as well.

&quot;What don&#146;t you agree with?&quot; Not looking, Juri waited for a logical 
reply.

&quot;His...choices. Perhaps you should have known why I suspended Utena. 
This was a good opportunity. I would have done it long ago, but she 
had no reason to be punished for anything. The fight was perfect.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Suspending her would keep her away from dueling. If Shintaro has Dios 
no Chikara, then Akio has no reason to kill her.&quot; Juri made not a 
sound at this reply. Her hand came up slowly to rub her chin for a 
moment before she snapped, her hand coming in loud contact with 
Touga&#146;s face.

&quot;Damn you! Why didn&#146;t you say a thing to us!? You are as guilty of 
keeping things from the Seitokai as I am!&quot; The golden-locked woman 
fumed, her fists clenched. Ignoring it, Touga stood, running his 
fingers over his jaw.

&quot;I was told not to tell.&quot; Touga simply stated. Not good enough for 
Juri, though.

&quot;Are you insane!? We could have prevented this! Why should Utena be 
forced to throw her life away!? Dios no Chikara means everything to 
her and I know it for a fact! Give it back to her, Touga! She is the 
rightful possessor, for she is the only one who can control the power! 
This boy tries anything and we will all be killed!&quot; Touga said 
nothing, nor did Juri. The conflict was rock solid by now and it took 
all of Juri&#146;s being not to take Keingo and hurl him over the ledge. 
&quot;Touga! Answer me! Why must she throw her life away!?&quot;

&quot;Because, sempai, it is my absolute destiny.&quot; A voice called.

&quot;Tenjou-sempai. When...did you get here?&quot; By now, poor Miki was beyond 
confused. 

&quot;Not long ago, Miki-kun.&quot; Utena spoke sincerely to him, but her 
sincerity changed upon looking to Touga. &quot;Kiryuu-Seitokaichou. I 
understand and forgive you, now, but no matter what you could have 
done, I wouldn&#146;t have given up. I&#146;ve learned a lot throughout this 
whole troublesome ordeal and one thing is that I can never give up. I 
will fight the Sekai no Hate and anything that stands in my way, 
including Shintaro Keingo.&quot; Shintaro looked shocked from the moment 
Utena had entered the room. It hadn&#146;t even been a week since the 
explosion and here was this seemingly immortal young girl glaring at 
him.

&quot;Wh...when the hell did you get out!? You couldn&#146;t have healed that 
fast! It&#146;s impossible! Don&#146;t you ever stay dead!?&quot;

&quot;Anything&#146;s possible when you possess Dios no Chikara. You are foolish 
to think you could have stripped me of it.&quot; 

&quot;I see. You think you learned so much, huh? Pop quiz, Tenjou-kun: What 
did that scar on your face teach you!?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ve learned more than enough from it.&quot;

&quot;It should be telling you that you can&#146;t defeat me!!&quot;

&quot;Keep telling yourself that, Shintaro. This scar is a minor lesson, 
but important. It&#146;s taught me not to give into my own outrage. If I 
do, it will plague me for the rest of my life.&quot; Utena turned her back 
on him, preparing to exit. &quot;Shintaro Keingo, for the honor of my 
Princess, and the honor of Dios, I challenge you.&quot;

&quot;...poor, stupid, bold, Tenjou-kun. I accept the honor of dealing the 
final blow.&quot;

&quot;If that&#146;s your intention. Tomorrow, as soon as school lets out, we 
duel.&quot; With a feeling of great confidence, Tenjou Utena disappeared 
behind the elevator doors, not once looking back, leaving the Seitokai 
in mild shock.

&quot;...baka, Tenjou-kun.&quot;

Night fell upon Ohtori Gakuen, an eve of Fate. Inside the Observation 
Tower, Shintaro Keingo draws Dios no Ken from within Himemiya Anthy&#146;s 
breast. The magnificent weapon appeared dull in his hand, as opposed 
to it&#146;s majestic shine when being wielded in Utena&#146;s.

&quot;Anthy, you&#146;ve been quite a burden these past few weeks. I fought to 
obtain your obedience and you&#146;ve done nothing but rebel. I should just 
strike you dead and see how much Tenjou-kun can take it.&quot; Slowly and 
frighteningly, he circled Anthy, running his fingers along the blade 
he held. &quot;All can be forgiven, Anthy. Would you like that?&quot;

&quot;It is not up to me, Shintaro-sama. Do as you wish.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s what I thought you&#146;d say. In such a case, you will teach me 
the techniques of Tenjou Utena. Everything she knows and does that 
helps her duel. As Bara no Hanayome you will do as I ask.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, Shintaro-sama, but only Utena-san could teach you such 
techniques.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve been around her long enough! You should know something about 
her sword skills! Give me that information or an even harsher way to 
win will be dealt, and you know what that means for her, don&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;Shintaro-sama, please, I honestly don&#146;t know.&quot; Keeping such brave 
composure was becoming more and more difficult for this poor young 
girl. It was obvious she knew, but she had to try or she may never be 
held in Utena&#146;s embrace again. The Bride kept her head bowed and her 
hands folded in her lap, the skirts of her blood-red dress pooled 
around her. Keingo paced around her, the skirts of the dress acting as 
the piranha-infested moat surrounding the stone walls of a castle, 
keeping the intruder out. &quot;Shintaro-sama, please, I&#146;m being truthful.&quot; 

&quot;Truthful!?&quot; The boy whipped around quickly, embedding the tip of the 
sword through Anthy&#146;s skirts into the floor, but not before leaving a 
paper-thin slit in her shin. &quot;For someone who has done so much with 
that little pain-in-the-ass tomboy, you cannot tell me you know 
nothing! Talk!&quot; The heated blush of fright burned Himemiya&#146;s cheeks 
and she moved her hands about nervously. What could she do? 

&quot;I...I know she fights with Dios no Chikara, but that is a given and 
it&#146;s all the knowledge I have.&quot;

&quot;Then you do know. Show it to me.&quot; The Bride&#146;s head quickly snapped 
up, looking to the boy in sheer terror. Show him? The Bara no Hanayome 
would know this more than anybody, she definitely couldn&#146;t lie about 
this and get away with it.

&quot;Please, I don&#146;t...&quot; 

&quot;Show me! There&#146;s no way you can tell me you don&#146;t know!&quot; Shintaro 
grabbed her by the shoulder, pulling her to him. &quot;Show me the motions, 
Anthy.&quot; 

&quot;Y...yes, Shintaro-sama.&quot; Stepping away from him, she looked 
desperately in her mind for a picture that could help her mimic the 
practically flawless sword technique of her beloved prince. Slowly and 
shakily, she performed a few motions, doing one after another with her 
short-tempered Victor following suit. Behind Anthy&#146;s breast, a rapid 
heartbeat pained her body. Thinking fast, a risky idea blossomed in 
her head. &quot;All right, Shintaro-sama, I need to show you the summoning 
technique of Dios. Utena-san relies on it in duels.&quot; 

&quot;So that&#146;s her secret weapon, huh? Fine, show me.&quot; Taking a place 
behind him, the Hanayome took his hands, setting his body into a 
position unlike Utena&#146;s. Knowing he wasn&#146;t the carrier of Dios no 
Chikara, this wouldn&#146;t be a problem, but she still couldn&#146;t blow 
Utena&#146;s stance. 

&quot;Now, you must chant to summon him.&quot;

&quot;What do I say?&quot; He asked impatiently.

&quot;Wait, I&#146;m trying to remember, now. Don&#146;t move or you&#146;ll sever the 
link.&quot; The young Bride couldn&#146;t believe what she was doing. Never had 
Himemiya Anthy lied to her Victor, but this was not her true 
Victor...Utena was. Of course, this is all for Utena! With her heart 
still beating painfully, Anthy walked backwards, quietly, towards the 
door. A single thought running in her head. &quot;Utena-sama. Utena-sama. 
Utena-sama...&quot; 

&quot;Hey, Anthy! C&#146;mon, I ain&#146;t got all night!&quot; The boy&#146;s voice broke 
through Anthy&#146;s confidence, her first thought: run! Quickly, she ran 
through the door, her fright choking off her breathing as she 
repeatedly pressed the elevator button. &quot;Anthy! Don&#146;t you run away 
from me, again! Get in here!&quot; His footsteps could be heard getting 
closer and closer. The Bride&#146;s heart was lodged up in her throat by 
now. 

&quot;Oh, hurry, please!&quot; Mentally, she begged for the elevator to come, 
though she knew it would be too late. The doors to the Rijichou-shitsu 
caught her eye and she made a break for them. Peeking through a crack 
in the doors, she saw him run into the hall.

&quot;Where the hell are you!?&quot; As he turned, he noticed the elevator doors 
close. &quot;Damn! She&#146;s going down!&quot; Pressing the button over and over, he 
got inside when the elevator returned, though he knew nothing of 
Anthy&#146;s hiding place.

&quot;He&#146;s gone. Oh, I&#146;m in so much trouble.&quot; Slowly, she slid down the 
length of the door and shut her eyes.

&quot;Anthy. You&#146;ve run away, again, haven&#146;t you?&quot;

&quot;O...onii-sama...&quot;

&quot;Were you afraid, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Yes, onii-sama. He...he wanted me to reveal Utena-sama&#146;s techniques.&quot;

&quot;And you didn&#146;t?&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;Anthy, with that knowledge, he could have defeated her and you both 
would have been freed. You&#146;ve thrown away a great opportunity.&quot;

&quot;I...I know, but at what price? Utena-sama could never forgive a 
traitor.&quot;

&quot;Not even if she loves that individual, like she does you?&quot;

&quot;I...am just the Bara no Hanayome.&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#146;t Utena in this to free you?&quot;

&quot;She...Utena-sama...I am just the Bara no Hanayome.&quot; 

&quot;I see. You are in denial. Let me help you. Let me show you what you 
will lose if she defeats him. What...you&#146;ll lose from her. I 
know...I&#146;ve seen it.&quot; Akio took Anthy, pushing her gently against one 
of the white sofas, and prepared his demonstration.

&quot;Onii-sama...&quot;

Author&#146;s words o&#146; useless wisdom:

Um...how do I put it mildly...how about....AKIO&#146;S A BIG PRICK! 
Anywho...things be lookin&#146; up and Utena&#146;s just pissed! 
Sooooo...what&#146;ll happen next? Will Utena win? Will Keingo win? Will it 
be a fair duel? OR will the explosive curry decimate the dueling arena 
and make Chu-chu the victor!?!? Nah. i&#39;m just dumb! See ya next time.</pre>
