<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Rock, paper, scissors!&quot; the group of girls standing in living room 
chanted together, and one left the circle with a sigh.

&quot;Rock, paper, scissors!&quot; and another girl walked off, pouting.

&quot;Rock, paper, scissors!&quot; a third walked away.

&quot;What are they doing?&quot; Wakaba walked over to Utena to ask.

Oddly, Utena was sitting with her head laying face down on the table, 
her long pink hair fanned out around her, and she was blushing 
brightly. Well, as brightly as a vampire could manage, anyway. 
&quot;They&#39;re playing to decide who gets to be with me tonight,&quot; Utena 
sighed.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Wakaba blushed.

&quot;I win,&quot; the petite blonde danced around happily. She bounded over to 
stand at Utena&#39;s side, cheerfully declaring, &quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot;

Utena had to smile a little at the girl&#39;s behavior. &quot;What&#39;s your 
name?&quot; she asked her as Utena smoothly rose from her seat..

The blonde grinned up at her, &quot;I&#39;m Excel!&quot;

Utena slid her arm gently around Excel&#39;s shoulder and softly asked 
her, &quot;And are you sure you want to do this?&quot;

Excel&#39;s eyes shone, &quot;Please, Utena-sama!&quot;

Utena drew Excel into the darkened bedroom, sitting them down at the 
bedside before gently kissing her cheek, then her jaw, then grazing 
her throat. Excel gave a soft, shuddering sigh and Utena gently tugged 
on the girl&#39;s blouse, helping her remove it. Utena kissed the breasts 
gently through the bra, and Excel gasped softly, wriggling slightly.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease,&quot; Excel gasped.

A throaty laugh was all the reply that Utena gave to that.

The pleated skirt went next, pooling on the floor at Excel&#39;s stocking 
clad feet, leaving the girl dressed only in her lace bra and panties. 
&quot;So pretty,&quot; Utena murmured in Excel&#39;s ear as she began to stroke the 
girl&#39;s slim body.

Excel felt stronger hands lay her down on the bed, her breath coming 
quicker as her pulse began to race. Another teasing kiss, and one hand 
cupped the breasts as another gently slid down the curved belly . A 
soft gasp, and fingers gently stroked the front of the already damp 
panties. The girl shuddered and twisted on the bed, her hips rising to 
meet those teasing fingers.

&quot;Oh, please now,&quot; Excel gasped out.

The fingers suddenly plunged deep, even as Utena let her fangs break 
the skin above Excel&#39;s breasts. The girl&#39;s ecstatic cry could be heard 
two apartments over.

It was only a few minutes later when Utena strode from the bedroom, 
licking her lips. Her cheeks were flushed, and there was much more 
vigor to her steps. She saw Wakaba still standing there and blushed 
faintly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Utena said softly to Wakaba, &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep it down next 
time.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; the thoroughly red faced Wakaba lied unconvincingly.

Utena just let that go. &quot;Have you seen Anthy around?&quot; she asked her 
instead.

&quot;I think she went up to the roof,&quot; Wakaba answered her. Utena smiled, 
squeezing her shoulder gently in thanks before leaving.

Utena strode down the nearly silent hallway to the stairway, climbing 
up them until she reached the rooftop access. She easily popped up the 
hatch and stepped out into the night. The moon lit the gravel strewn 
roof, a flat surface easy to stand on.

Utena saw clothes lying on the roof and began to pick them up, 
following them like a trail of bread crumbs to where Anthy stood 
looking out at the city. The dark skinned girl was naked, her long 
purple hair blowing in the gentle breeze.

&quot;I don&#39;t even feel the cold anymore,&quot; Anthy said as Utena came up 
behind her. She turned to look at Utena, her eyes glowing faintly in 
the darkness.

&quot;Are you.. all right?&quot; Utena asked her hesitantly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Anthy answered her calmly. She looked out at the city, 
&quot;I so wanted to bite someone, last night. I could barely fight the 
urge.&quot; She took a breath, more out of reflex than because she might 
need to, &quot;How do you stand it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m no saint,&quot; Utena said softly, thinking of the girl she had left 
sleeping in the bedroom. She took a few steps forward to stand at 
Anthy&#39;s side, &quot;For me, it&#39;s been a matter of choice.&quot; Quietly, &quot;I 
swore I would never hurt someone, and I&#39;ve tried to live up to it.&quot;

&quot;What if... I can&#39;t control myself?&quot; Anthy asked her hesitantly.

Utena met those dark eyes with her own blue ones as she told Anthy 
simply, &quot;Then I&#39;ll do what I have to.&quot;

Anthy actually smiled at that as she said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; They stood 
there silently for a few moments until she asked, &quot;So what are we 
going to do tonight?&quot;

&quot;Patrol,&quot; Utena shrugged, &quot;and Ayeka suggested that we should go see 
someone named Himiko. I doubt it was a casual comment coming from 
her.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Anthy nodded, turning and walking towards the 
rooftop hatch.

Utena grabbed at her arm, and Anthy looked at her curiously. 
&quot;Clothes?&quot; Utena raised her eyebrow with a grin.

Anthy looked down and remembered her unclothed state, &quot;Oh.&quot; She 
blushed a bit and quickly began to pull her clothes back on. A short 
stop in the suite below and the two were off.

They traveled the streets, scanning the alleys and dark corners for 
anyone lurking there. The creatures of the night had began to pass the 
word around, and their trip was quieter that either one of them would 
have preferred.

The temple they reached was clearly in disrepair, and an unusual aura 
seemed to hang over the place. &quot;This place is creepy even to me,&quot; 
Utena admitted softly.

&quot;Are you sure this is the right place?&quot; Anthy asked her quietly. She 
shivered a bit, but not from feeling the cold.

&quot;I called Ayeka, and she gave me directions,&quot; Utena shrugged. Slightly 
louder she called out questioningly, &quot;Himiko?&quot;

She stepped out of the shadows, her long brown hair blowing around 
her. Traditional paper charms glowed softly in her hands, an aura of 
power radiating from her as she declared, &quot;Creatures of the night! 
Flee this place, or suffer the consequences.&quot;

Utena held up her empty hands and said, &quot;We come in peace.&quot; At the 
woman&#39;s clearly skeptical glance Utena added, &quot;We were sent by Ayeka 
Kisaragi.&quot;

&quot;Ayeka?&quot; the brown haired woman looked a bit surprised at hearing that 
name. She gazed at Utena and Anthy closely for any sign of deception.

&quot;Himiko, I think,&quot; the soft voice surprised them, &quot;that they are here 
to see me.&quot; She didn&#39;t step out of the shadows, she simply appeared, 
along with a tall, cloaked companion. &quot;Larva,&quot; she said to it softly, 
&quot;protect Himiko.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the one called Larva answered in masculine tones before moving 
over to stand protectively at Himiko&#39;s side.

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Himiko called out.

The girl walked over to Utena and Anthy, her skin bleached white as 
snow. She shone in the moonlight, radiating raw power as she neared 
them. Looking almost like a child&#39;s porcelain doll she gazed up at 
Utena and said, &quot;My name is Miyu.&quot; A little pause and she quite 
pleasantly asked, &quot;So tell me, why shouldn&#39;t I kill you both where you 
stand?&quot;

Back at the apartment, a lightly dozing Wakaba was startled awake by 
the phone ringing. &quot;Yes?&quot; she picked it up to ask.

The young man at the front desk sounded a bit stressed as he said to 
her, &quot;There&#39;s someone here to see Mrs. Tenjou.&quot;

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Wakaba asked.

&quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; he answered, &quot;Should I send her up?&quot;

Wakaba&#39;s jaw visibly dropped on hearing that. &#39;Juri?&#39; she thought to 
herself dazedly, &#39;We left her back at Ohtori, didn&#39;t we?&#39;

The man repeated the question, &quot;Should I send her up? Or would you 
rather I send her away?&quot;

&#39;I&#39;d like to see you try,&#39; Wakaba smirked. &quot;Send her up, please,&quot; she 
said aloud.

A few moments later, and there was a firm knocking on the front door. 
Wakaba swiftly opened it, and Juri and Ruka strode inside. &quot;Do you 
have any idea how hard it was to find you?&quot; Ruka complained as he 
flopped into a chair.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Wakaba asked them both.

&quot;Where&#39;s Utena?&quot; Juri asked her impatiently instead of answering the 
question.

Wakaba frowned at the tone she was using, &quot;She and Anthy are out on 
patrol.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Juri turned and walked towards the door.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Ruka snagged her arm, &quot;if we go out, there&#39;s not much 
chance of us running into her. Shouldn&#39;t we just wait here?&quot;

Juri obviously would have preferred to be taking action, but after a 
moment she nodded. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Wakaba rephrased the question, sounding much more 
dangerous.

&quot;Trouble,&quot; Ruka sighed, &quot;big trouble.&quot;

Far closer than any of them would have liked was the penthouse 
apartment of one of the richest women in the city. A woman who was now 
standing entranced, looking dreamily into Shiori&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Go lay down,&quot; Shiori ordered the woman, adding with a smile, &quot;we&#39;ll 
be hungry later.&quot;

Dressed in only the slightest of lingerie the woman walked out of the 
living room to lay down in her bedroom. Once Shiori was sure that she 
was fast asleep, she went to join her own Mistress standing out on the 
balcony.

Mrs. Ohtori looked over at her, &quot;Is she near?&quot;

&quot;Utena is in the city,&quot; Shiori nodded, &quot;I can feel her.&quot;

&quot;Juri is excited,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori smiled, &quot;she must be near to finding 
her.&quot; A soft laugh, &quot;I wonder, should I let this game play out a 
little longer?&quot;

Shiori smiled a fangy smile, &quot;I almost can&#39;t wait to see the look on 
Juri&#39;s face.&quot;

Both of them laughed softly, looking out at the moon light.
