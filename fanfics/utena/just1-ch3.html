<h1>Just One Summer (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/just1-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Afterwards Utena couldn&#39;t remember how they made the way back to the 
small village. Utena quickly dressed herself in some clothes she found 
in her rucksack and helped Anthy in her jeans and in a thick pullover. 
The smaller girl started to tremble and whispered that she froze. 
Utena tore apart one of her shirts and made a bandage around Anthy&#39;s 
head. Then she took the bronze girl on her back and went back. 
Ignoring Anthy&#39;s weak protests that they couldn&#39;t leave their tents 
and all their rucksacks behind. Utena didn&#39;t answer. She had put her 
purse in her pocket and everything else was replaceable. Everything 
else wasn&#39;t as important as Anthy. Chuchu climbed on her right 
shoulder and Utena didn&#39;t even argue with him. She couldn&#39;t blame him, 
he was only a small animal. A greedy one, but she was the only one to 
be blamed. She should have known that Anthy would do such a crazy 
thing as trying to catch their last chocolate bar.

A chocolate bar! Only a single chocolate bar! And now Anthy is ill!

Utena gulped and clenched her fists until it hurt.

They needed almost three hours to get back to the village. Utena 
wasn&#39;t as fast as normal with Anthy on her back who was lighter than 
she had expected. Anthy looked extremely thin, but she hardly weighed 
anything. Utena talked the whole time to her to make sure that she 
wouldn&#39;t faint.

It was past noon when they finally arrived. The doctor didn&#39;t ask 
much. He only called his nurses and they all disappeared behind a 
door. Together with Anthy. Leaving a confused and very scared Utena 
sitting alone on the corridor.

It&#39;s all my fault!

Me and my stupid behaviour!

Me and my silly greed of chocolate!

That damn bar!

Shimatta!

Utena gulped and buried her face in her hands.

Anthy...

If anything happened to the smaller girl, if she was dangerously 
injured, Utena would never forgive her that. Shimatta! I wanted her to 
spend some days outside the school. Forgetting that she believes in 
that stupid Rose Bride stuff for some weeks. Instead I hurt her! 
Shimatta!

The door was opened and Utena raised her head. Her blue eyes were wide 
with fear as she watched how the doctor came over to her. He smiled 
friendly at her but she didn&#39;t see it. She tried to see behind him, 
but the door was closed again.

&quot;What about Anthy?&quot; asked Utena and felt sick. Like throwing up the 
breakfast she actually missed. Because of her damn greed. Her fists 
were ice cold and slowly she rose from the chair. &quot;Is she feeling 
fine?&quot;

&quot;Your sister was lucky, Tenjoh-san.&quot; The doctor kept smiling and 
pointed her to sat down again. As she did he took place next to her. 
&quot;The wound on her head is not as deep as we feared first and obviously 
she didn&#39;t have a concussion. She doesn&#39;t feel sick or fainted. She is 
only tired.&quot; He sighed and looked around. But there was only the girl 
sitting next to him. Looking expectantly in his old face. No parent, 
no other adult. Only a girl he wasn&#39;t even sure if she was the bronze 
girl&#39;s sister. But he only was allowed to tell medical facts to family 
members and because they only got the insurance card of a Tenjoh 
Utena, he decided quietly that the girl inside his patient&#39;s room was 
the sister. Maybe the adopted one. Or the stepsister.

&quot;Is there anyone who could take care for her? Her right foot isn&#39;t 
broken as we feared when we x-rayed it. But she has a real bad pulled 
muscle and won&#39;t be able to walk the next days. Then she&#39;ll have to 
take a crutch to move. Otherwise I&#39;ll have to send her to the next big 
hospital until she&#39;s able to take care for herself again.&quot;

Anthy?

Alone in a big hospital?

Utena shook her head and gulped.

&quot;I&#39;ll call my aunt up. She&#39;ll come to take us home.&quot; Utena sighed 
deeply. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, doctor. She&#39;ll get an excellent nurse.&quot;

My aunt always healed me when I hurt myself when I was younger.

The doctor smiled and nodded thoughtfully. Looking at the tall girl 
with the concerned expression on a pale face.

&quot;Sure she will.&quot;

He rose and handled her some moments later a dark telephone.

&quot;Call your aunt up, Tenjoh-san. Your sister needs rest now.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Utena looked at the phone and gulped again.

Auntie will kill me. Surely she will kill me, because this time I have 
overdone it with my stupidity. With my great talent of always doing 
the greatest nonsense. Of involving other persons. Of hurting them...

She sighed deeply as she dialled the numbers.

This time I deserve her scolding with me. This time she is right. This 
time I should have thought better before I reacted. Before I left her 
alone on the cliff and ran for my shirts. Only thinking of my 
chocolate bar. Not of Anthy who would of course try to save it. She 
was too long the Rose Bride than ignoring something that seems to be 
important for me being sunken in the lake!

But Anthy is so much more important for me. Shimatta!

&quot;Can I see her, doctor?&quot;

Shortly he looked at her and nodded finally. Normally that was against 
the rules, but the doctor was an old man who learned long before that 
rules weren&#39;t always important. Important was that his patients would 
regain strength again. Mostly they received it by their family or 
their friends. And the girl inside his little white room seemed to 
need badly a good friend. 

&quot;Be quiet. We gave her some painkillers. And let that pet outside. 
This is a hospital after all.&quot; He bowed forward and petted Chuchu&#39;s 
fur. The little animal purred but his big eyes were still watery. He 
seemed to be as concerned about the bronze girl as the other one just 
talking to her aunt.

&quot;Auntie? Hai, it&#39;s Utena.&quot; Utena gulped and held the telephone a 
little bit tighter. &quot;I need your help, auntie.&quot;

***

They bandaged her right foot. Just like they took care for the wound 
on her head. Still she was in pain. But it wasn&#39;t as bad as it had 
been the past hours. Somehow it was trapped deep inside her head now. 
All that left was a knocking inside her head. They gave her some 
pills, surely painkillers. She gulped them without asking. She never 
asked about medicine. Especially when she felt so sick.

Now she only felt tired. Very tired.

But not tired enough to overhear the nurses silent words. That she 
would have to go to a bigger hospital, because they were only a small 
doctor&#39;s practice and that this village was too small to have a real 
hospital. That they would have to call for an ambulance if no one 
would take her home to take care for her there.

Home?

Anthy gulped and tried to move in the soft bed she was lying in. Still 
wearing the clothes Utena gave her. Shortly before they left the lake.

The tent!

Her rucksack!

Our things!

Anthy wanted to sit up but she couldn&#39;t. The nurses did a good job 
with her feet, but she couldn&#39;t move it. Not even the medicine was 
strong enough to hold back the pain that now flashed through her body. 
The bronze girl groaned tortured and kept lying. Closed her eyes 
again. Trying to be as patient as she had always been. When she waited 
for another duel that would decide over her destiny. That could change 
her life forever. The way it did half a year ago. When Utena appeared 
under the floating castle and defeated Saionji. Anthy tried to be as 
patient as she always had to be when the pink haired girl duelled with 
the other pupil. With young men and women who were older than her. Who 
were more skilled than her. Who were simply stronger than her. Fearing 
that Utena would lose this time. But the girl who wanted so badly to 
be a prince, won every time and Anthy could stay for at least another 
day or week.

Hai, Anthy knew what patience meant, but suddenly she felt restless. 
She wanted to get out of that bed. To leave that room and the doctor. 
To go back to the big lake. To see again Utena fighting with herself 
and the desire to eat the last chocolate bar. To swim again next to 
her best friend. To feel again her creeping nearer to her in the 
middle of the night when the thunder rolled loudly above. To be held 
tight. So protectively.

I don&#39;t want to go in a hospital.

She felt how her eyes watered but wasn&#39;t willing to cry. It didn&#39;t 
change things, she knew. It only let her cough and sniffle. And look 
very ugly as Saionji told her when she cried after he slapped her.

I don&#39;t want to go in a hospital!

The idea of being alone for the rest of the summer scared her more 
than the thought of waiting again for hours for the next duel to 
begin, because Toga had another date and forget them. She didn&#39;t want 
to lay awake the whole night. In a strange room. Staring at a strange 
ceiling. Having too much time to think over her life and over the 
future. It had been so wonderful with Utena. The pink haired girl was 
always so funny. So crazy. Making her giggle and sometimes even laugh 
when she tickled her. With Utena Anthy felt safe and secure. Needed. 
Loved. Without her she felt left and alone.

She tried again to move her foot. Maybe it wasn&#39;t so bad? Maybe 
something of Utena&#39;s healing ointment she used for her burned skin 
some days ago would be enough to make her walk again? Maybe they could 
return to the lake within the next hour? Maybe...

Some tears escaped her eyes as the pain told her that she wouldn&#39;t go 
anywhere. Not alone. That her foot was really injured. Just like her 
head. That she would stay here or in the bigger hospital the nurses 
mentioned.

No.

Please...

&quot;Anthy?&quot; she winced as she felt how soft hands wiped away her tears. 
She opened her eyes and looked into a pale face. The smile was unsure 
and blue eyes were full with concern. Utena looked shortly around, but 
there was no nurse around who would kick her out of the room. She sat 
carefully down on the soft mattress and caressed again that soft skin. 
&quot;I called my auntie up.&quot; Utena made a tortured face. &quot;She was not very 
happy, but I guess I deserve her anger. Does it hurt a lot, Anthy?&quot;

The smaller girl gulped and without warning more tears ran down her 
cheeks. Silently she started to sob and searched helpless for her 
glasses. The nurses put them somewhere near the bed but she couldn&#39;t 
reach the table or whatever stood there.

&quot;Anthy? Shimatta, is it really so bad?&quot; Utena made a depressed face, 
scolding herself silently that she hurt her best friend so deeply. &quot;I 
am sorry, Anthy. I am really sorry. It&#39;s all my fault. Me and my damn 
chocolate bar! I should have known that you try to save it! That the 
cliff is too steep for you to climb it! That I should have let the bar 
there and go back to the tent - together with you, Anthy. I should...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go to that hospital.&quot;

&quot;... have taken Chuchu and... uh?&quot; Utena blinked confused as she heard 
the quiet words hardly interrupting her guilty stammer. 

&quot;Please, don&#39;t let them take me to a hospital, Utena. Please...&quot; 
sobbed Anthy and tried to sit up. Utena could see the pain on the 
smaller girl&#39;s pale face.

Utena.

She called me Utena.

For the first time when she&#39;s awake...

&quot;They won&#39;t, Anthy.&quot; The pink haired girl took Anthy&#39;s shoulder and 
pushed her carefully back into the soft pillow. &quot;I called my aunt up. 
She comes to take us home.&quot; Utena looked even more guilty, if that was 
possible. &quot;I already told her that I&#39;ll bring a friend with me to stay 
over the summer. But I didn&#39;t think that you would be injured... 
because of me...&quot;

Home.

Anthy&#39;s purple eyes grew wide and the tears dried slowly away.

Did she say home?

The bronze girl couldn&#39;t remember of ever having had a home before. A 
place she could call home. The school, no, that was no home. That was 
somewhere to exist, but nowhere to live.

&quot;I don&#39;t have...&quot; Anthy gulped and closed her eyes again. The 
painkiller did a good job and she felt more and more tired with every 
minute. &quot;The nurses said that someone has to take care and...&quot; she 
yawned and felt again those soft fingertips on her still damp cheeks. 
Wiping away the last tears. Calming her down.

&quot;I&#39;ll take care for you, Anthy.&quot; She could hear Utena&#39;s shaky voice 
next to her. Somewhere next to her. The medicine overtook her thoughts 
and she felt how she drifted slowly but finally into sleep. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, Anthy, I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

***

&quot;Utena...&quot;

The tall woman sighed deeply as she saw how the girl winced. She sat 
on a bed and held a bronze hand in her own tight. The girl inside the 
bed was very pale under her bronze skin. The first idea she had about 
her was one single word: Fragile. And the second thought: She is 
complete different to my niece-chan. But there was something in blue 
eyes that made the tall woman hesitate. She knew that she should never 
have prejudices. That she should never judge over a person before she 
didn&#39;t get to know her.

Or I will do the same mistake I did with Ayani.

&quot;Auntie...&quot; Utena looked up and there sparkled tears in her eyes. 
Tears she had never seen before on her niece&#39;s face. Not after her 
parents died ten years ago. &quot;Gomen...&quot;

The tall woman wiped some pink strands out of her face and sighed 
deeply. Then she walked over to her niece and embraced her shortly.

&quot;I talked to the doctor. Give your friend some days of rest and soon 
she&#39;ll be wild again.&quot; Although Tenjoh Rinja wasn&#39;t sure if the 
sleeping girl was really as wild as her niece. If anyone on this earth 
could be as wild as Utena. Well, maybe besides Kei.

&quot;Let&#39;s wake her up and take her home.&quot;

Utena nodded and leaned over to the smaller girl. Whispering some 
words. The girl opened purple eyes and looked confused around. A shy 
smile appeared on her face as she saw the tall woman and Rinja decided 
quietly that this girl wasn&#39;t wild at all. Silently she wondered how 
someone like this girl could be Utena&#39;s new best friend after Kei 
started to work and Wakaba moved away. But - different from her niece 
- she was patient. This girl would live with them for the next six 
weeks until the summer was over and school term would start again. 
Enough time to get to know her closer.

&quot;Hello, I am Tenjoh Rinja, this tomboy&#39;s aunt. But everyone calls me 
auntie.&quot; She said and bowed. Purple eyes grew wide and surely the 
injured girl saw how much Utena and she resembled each other. Utena 
earned most of her appearance by her father and Rinja had been Utena&#39;s 
father&#39;s twin sister.

&quot;Himemiya Anthy. I am pleased to meet you.&quot; 

The smaller girl bowed, too, and almost fainted.

***

&quot;How should I&#39;ve known that she would bow in her state of body?&quot;

Rinja went around the car to open the door for the still very pale 
girl. Her niece followed her. The mouth formed to a line of anger.

&quot;Anthy is different, auntie. She has manners!&quot;

&quot;How does she survive it then with someone like you?&quot; Her aunt looked 
directly at her and Utena got even more angry. Mostly about her head 
blushing deeply.

&quot;We got a double room at school.&quot; 

&quot;I am sure she has to tidy up the room when she wants to make her 
homework, right?&quot;

&quot;Auntie!&quot;

Utena blushed even deeper and Rinja had to grin. She couldn&#39;t remember 
to see her niece as shameful as now. Then her face got serious again 
as she opened the door. Together they helped Anthy outside who was 
still half asleep.

&quot;My room.&quot; Directed Utena as they entered the house. Her room was 
ground floor, right behind the restaurant. Anthy wouldn&#39;t have to use 
the staircase and it would be easier for her to reach the bathroom. 
Rinja nodded agreeing.

&quot;But you have to tidy it up as soon as she&#39;s awake. Not that she dies 
because of the shock how messy you are.&quot;

&quot;Anthy has seen my wardrobe at school.&quot;

&quot;And she still wants to be your friend?&quot;

&quot;Auntie!&quot;

Anthy didn&#39;t say a word. She didn&#39;t even seem to hear them. The doctor 
told them that she got enough medicine to sleep for the rest of the 
day and the following night and that they should leave her that rest. 
Carefully Utena and her aunt undressed the smaller girl, trying not to 
touch her feet and her head. Utena grabbed into her wardrobe and 
pulled one shirt out. Without looking at it she pulled it around 
Anthy&#39;s shoulder and buttoned it. Then she covered the smaller girl 
with the blanket and looked for a moment thoughtful at her. Anthy 
didn&#39;t notice it. She was fast asleep the moment her head touched the 
pillow.

She gave her her most favourite shirt.

Rinja frowned and watched how a brown animal jumped off Utena&#39;s 
shoulder and rolled himself up in a ball on the pillow. Next to the 
smaller girl&#39;s head. Chuchu, as Utena had called the little animal. 
Anthy&#39;s pet. A little bit cheeky and always hungry, but loyal and 
house-trained. Rinja didn&#39;t mind. She had a dog herself, lying in the 
living room right now and waiting for her to return. They were very 
quietly so that her pet didn&#39;t hear her come.

The shirt that once belonged her father.

Rinja frowned but didn&#39;t say a word as Utena stroke gently some violet 
hairs away and finally rose. Silently they left the room and went over 
to the kitchen. There she sat down behind the table and looked tired, 
but still very angry. Probably angry about herself. Her aunt knew that 
she didn&#39;t have to scold with her niece this time, Utena already 
looked guilty enough. Silently Rinja decided to talk later to her 
niece. When her head was a little bit clearer. When she had enough 
time to think.

&quot;Let&#39;s make a deal, okay?&quot; she bowed for the broom and leaned it 
against the wood. &quot;You&#39;ll tidy up the restaurant so that I can open it 
in the evening. I&#39;ll drive back and get your things from the lake. 
You&#39;ve still been at the lake, right?&quot;

Utena looked from her to the broom and nodded finally.

&quot;Right.&quot;

***

Utena was on her knees and cleaned the ground. Her hands were dirty 
but she didn&#39;t mind. Slowly her anger disappeared and now, after four 
hours of taking really good care of the restaurant, she was calmer. 
Her aunt returned half an hour ago and now took care for their dirty 
clothes. She knew that they wouldn&#39;t fit any longer when her niece 
would wash them. She always used the wrong washing powder and the 
water was always too hot for the clothes.

&quot;Do you always have to put your friends in your clothes?&quot;

Rinja came out in the restaurant and held some used T-shirts in the 
air.

&quot;Anthy only has skirts and her school uniform. You know, you can&#39;t go 
camping with these.&quot; Utena didn&#39;t look up, only continued to wipe the 
ground.

&quot;Wonder how they fitted. Your friend is smaller than you, right?&quot;

&quot;I never threw away my old boots and you can always roll up the 
jeans.&quot;

&quot;You still have that one?&quot; Rinja raised the black T-shirt and had to 
grin as she saw her niece&#39;s innocent expression.

&quot;Of course, it was a gift of Kei!&quot; protested Utena and rose to grab it 
back. &quot;I always wear it with pride.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully not around the church, do you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like the priest anyway.&quot;

&quot;Utena!&quot;

&quot;Okay, auntie, I won&#39;t wear it here, okay?&quot;

Rinja giggled as she returned to the kitchen.

&quot;I wonder what your teachers think about you. Did you wear it there?&quot;

&quot;No, we have to wear our school uniforms.&quot;

Rinja raised her eyebrows as she pulled some more clothes away and 
found a book. A small, brown book in each rucksack. Curious she had to 
open them.

&quot;Do you still wear that uniform Hamamodo-san made for you?&quot;

&quot;Hai. You can tell him that he is an excellent tailor.&quot;

&quot;I do so when I meet him.&quot;

Rinja read the lines under all the points. Of course they described 
that her niece was wild, impatient but very intelligent. The bronze 
girl&#39;s lines couldn&#39;t have been more different: Calm, shy and very 
diligent. Utena was in almost every sport team and helped the school 
to win some important games. Anthy took care for the rose garden and 
all flowers bloomed wonderfully. 

&quot;Your mark in Japanese literature increased. How did you do that?&quot; 
Rinja saw how her niece&#39;s head jerked around and how her eyes grew 
wide.

&quot;Oh... my report. I didn&#39;t think about it any longer.&quot; She cleaned her 
hands on her jeans and came over to her aunt. &quot;And Anthy&#39;s?&quot; in 
disbelieve she stared at the other brown book.

&quot;Her marks are a lot better than yours, Tenjoh-san junior!&quot;

Utena blushed and sulked slightly.

&quot;But my sport mark is better than hers.&quot;

&quot;I guess everyone&#39;s sport mark on this planet is worse than yours.&quot;

&quot;But I improved!&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Rinja compared this year&#39;s report with the last one and nodded. 
&quot;This new school seems to be better for you.&quot; She nodded again and 
frowned. &quot;But your French mark is still very bad.&quot;

&quot;But it was enough to get through! Auntie! You know that Japanese is 
already a hard language for me. To torture me with French is inhuman!&quot;

Rinja giggled and stroke through pink hairs that looked like her own 
ones.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, junior.&quot; Thoughtful she looked at the other girl&#39;s report 
and put it finally down. &quot;Do you like it at your new school? You know, 
you could live here as well and visit our school. You don&#39;t have to be 
so far away. It&#39;s just that this other school is very known and 
better.&quot;

Utena smiled and secretly closed her report and put it under Anthy&#39;s. 
So that it was far away. At least out of her aunt&#39;s sight.

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. I have to admit that I changed school, because of 
Wakaba going there. But I like it there. It&#39;s...&quot; she searched for the 
right word to express the strange situation with the school council 
and the duels she fought almost every day. &quot;... it&#39;s different from 
our school&#39;s here. The people are nice there and Anthy is a smart 
girl.&quot;

When she doesn&#39;t have to be the Rose Bride instead of Himemiya Anthy.

&quot;Although some teachers could be more interesting. Can you imagine, 
auntie, in our last literature lesson we read a story about a damn 
ducky and a damn fox.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t curse, junior!&quot;

&quot;Okay, about a cute, sweet ducky and a bad, cruel fox.&quot; Utena rolled 
her eyes and her voice was sarcastic. Her aunt giggled again and shook 
her head.

&quot;You never liked such stories, right?&quot;

As you didn&#39;t like so much other things. Like dresses and perms. Like 
dolls and to tidy up your room. You got that idea with your prince and 
stopped being a nice girl the day your parents died. Now you are a 
wild girl. My wild girl.

&quot;Hm.&quot; Utena nodded and shrugged her shoulders. &quot;You know how I am.&quot;

Her aunt embraced her shortly and messed pink hairs.

Hai, my little tomboy.

&quot;Hai, I know, junior. I know.&quot;

But I like you the way you are. Your father&#39;s daughter.

***

Unsure Anthy sat on a chair. In the middle of the restaurant. It was 
early in the morning and the restaurant was still closed. Mostly it 
had opened at noon and around the evening hours. Now Utena&#39;s aunt set 
the table for a good breakfast. The rolls smelled delicious and Anthy 
had to admit that she was indeed hungry. But it felt strange to sit 
around so lazily. Not when she normally took care for their meals. Or 
at least tried to.Her foot still hurt, but it was bearable when she 
didn&#39;t move it. She sat on diverse pillows and the bandage was removed 
from her head. The tall woman helped her and now only a plaster 
remembered that Anthy hit her head on a stone. She wasn&#39;t dizzy nor 
did she feel sick. Obviously she had a lot of luck and didn&#39;t get a 
concussion. 

Only headaches that would hopefully go soon.

&quot;Do you want meat for breakfast or jam?&quot; Rinja asked and put the warm 
milk down. Her niece was still upstairs and tried to get dressed. 
Tried desperately to get awake. She helped her with the guests in the 
evening and it got late before she could go to bed. Or at least to lay 
down on the ground. She didn&#39;t want to take a guest room, so she took 
a blanket and laid on it next to her bed where Anthy slept deep and 
tight.

&quot;Jam is fine, Tenjoh-san. Arigato.&quot; Anthy smiled friendly and reached 
for the milk. Automatically she filled two cups.

She really has manners. Or is she only so shy because she doesn&#39;t know 
me?

Rinja could remember too well how Kei had behaved when she met him the 
first time. And how he behaved now. Not that he was rude or so, he was 
simply wild. As wild as Utena.

&quot;Call me auntie, okay? Everyone calls me auntie. Tenjoh-san sounds so 
formal.&quot;

Anthy frowned but finally nodded carefully.

&quot;Hai.&quot; She replied and took the cocoa. For some moments she stirred in 
the milk before she put the package again away. It had been exactly 
two and a half spoon full. And it wasn&#39;t even Anthy&#39;s milk.Utena 
drinks her milk that way.

Rinja looked for some moments thoughtful at the smaller girl, but 
before she could ask, the door was opened and a still sleepy Utena 
entered the room.

&quot;Did someone got the number of the track that ran over me?&quot; she asked 
and sat down next to Anthy. Taking her warm cocoa milk in her hands 
and staring with small eyes at it. &quot;Morning, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Good morning.&quot;

&quot;How are you feeling? Better?&quot;

&quot;Hai, I am fine, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Anthy smiled a soft smile. &quot;As long as 
I don&#39;t have to dance it&#39;s pretty fine.&quot;

&quot;Better not. The last time I stepped on your feet for three times.&quot;

&quot;Four.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Utena groaned and drank some gulps of her milk. It seemed to 
be okay, because she didn&#39;t add more of the cocoa nor did she complain 
that it was too much.

They danced?

Rinja sat down and handled them a roll. Anthy thanked while Utena 
looked sleepy at it as if she was wondering what it was. Finally she 
sighed and cut it open. And gave Anthy the upper part of it. Utena 
never liked the upper part of a roll, because it always fell over when 
she put a thick layer of jam on it. Just like she did right now. Anthy 
didn&#39;t seem to be surprised. She took it and put a little bit butter 
and a little bit jam on it, too. Strawberry jam.

&quot;Did you make that jam, Tenj... auntie?&quot; corrected Anthy herself as 
she saw how blue eyes looked warning at her. The same eyes like Utena.

&quot;Hai. We have a little garden behind the house. There&#39;s my dog right 
now, Hamlet. I&#39;ll introduce you to him when you can walk better with 
your crutches. He is a really lovely dog, but he is clumsy and wild. 
He would like you and knock you over by the attempt of showing it to 
you.&quot;

&quot;You see, Anthy, it&#39;s simply in the family. I am innocence.&quot; Giggled 
Utena and served herself another roll. She cut it and handled the 
other half to Anthy who didn&#39;t even bit into the first one.

&quot;Does your dog&#39;s hut looks the same your wardrobe looks?&quot; Purple eyes 
sparkled and shortly they glanced at each other. Utena blushed and 
Anthy giggled silently.

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad, Anthy!&quot; Utena pointed over to her aunt. &quot;What shall 
my auntie think of me when you say such things about me?&quot;

&quot;I think that you didn&#39;t change during the past year, junior.&quot; Rinja 
grinned and took sugar in her coffee.

&quot;Do you want to call anyone up, Anthy? Maybe your parents and tell 
them that you are alright?&quot;

There was a change in Anthy&#39;s face. Her eyes stopped to sparkle and 
the smile froze on her face. For someone who didn&#39;t look closer, 
wouldn&#39;t have noticed it. But Rinja did. She had a lot of guests every 
evening and she learned different kinds of humans to know. They 
behaviour and their reactions. Anthy&#39;s reaction was hesitant. Hesitant 
and sad.

&quot;They died shortly after my birth.&quot; Said the bronze girl and put her 
roll down. &quot;My guardian knows that I am here. I don&#39;t have to call him 
up.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, I am sorry. I didn&#39;t know that, Anthy.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad, Tenj... auntie. I can&#39;t remember them anyway and my 
guardian has to work a lot. But he knows Utena and knows that I am 
well here.&quot;

Whom is she talking about? What guardian?

Utena stirred in her cocoa milk and wondered how much she didn&#39;t know 
about her best friend. So many things she didn&#39;t dare to ask. So many 
questions she never got an answer back.

What guardian? The school council? Toga? Saionji?

&quot;Arigato for taking me in your house, Tenjoh... auntie.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not a problem.&quot; Rinja finished another roll and let out a 
relieved sigh. Her stomach slowly calmed down. &quot;My niece&#39;s friends are 
always welcomed. Just one advice, Anthy, let her starve the next time 
she loses her chocolate bar. She&#39;s thick enough to survive it.&quot;

&quot;Auntie!&quot;

Rinja grinned and watched how a giggling Anthy put a roll away.

&quot;Oh, and you can take your little pet down the next time. It doesn&#39;t 
have to sit alone and sad in Utena&#39;s messed room.&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t messed, auntie. I tried to tidy it up.&quot;

&quot;Right, you tried it, junior.&quot;

&quot;AH! Auntie!&quot;

&quot;I am sure Hamlet will like your little pet. How is its name?&quot;

&quot;His name is Chuchu.&quot;

&quot;A really nice name. Well, Utena named Hamlet. Because of a video game 
she liked. She didn&#39;t even read Shakespeare and everyone thought that 
she was intelligent when she chose that name.&quot;

&quot;AUNTIE!&quot;

Anthy looked from the tall woman with pink hairs to the girl who was 
almost as tall as her. Both staring at each other with the same 
teasing expression in their blue eyes.

&quot;Once I bought her a bookshelf, Anthy. Do you know what she put in it? 
Mangas.&quot;

&quot;AUNTIE! That&#39;s unfair!&quot;

Anthy only giggled.

***

&quot;Do you want to watch TV? I have a really good anime on video.&quot; Utena 
knelt down before her own TV set and searched in the mess of tapes for 
the remote control. She didn&#39;t find them and so she grinned over to 
Anthy who sat on her bed and gave Chuchu the roll. The little pet 
started greedily to eat.

&quot;Guess music is better. There&#39;s a really good CD Kei gave me some 
years ago.&quot; Now she started to search in a big hill of CDs.

&quot;Maybe a book? Or a manga?&quot; suggested Anthy and leaned against the 
pillow. She only went to the bathroom and to the kitchen, but 
nevertheless she was exhausted. It was unaccustomed for her to use a 
crutch and she felt still a little bit tired. She only wanted to lay 
down and to sleep a little bit more.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to stay here. I am sure you have other things to you 
once you are home.&quot;

Utena who finally found a nice CD in the big mess, turned around and 
looked thoughtful at the bronze girl. Anthy stroke Chuchu&#39;s fur and 
smiled that soft smile.

Other things to do than being with you? I am on vacations with you, 
Anthy, can&#39;t you remember? You don&#39;t have to be the Rose Bride any 
longer. Only my friend.

Somehow she couldn&#39;t ask her aloud. She simply put the CD in the 
player and sat down next to the smaller girl. Soon soft guitar music 
filled the room.

&quot;Maybe we can play a board game. It&#39;s somewhere under my bed.&quot; Utena 
bowed down and her hairs fell into her neck as she looked under her 
bed. Seeing the dust and the mess there. &quot;I lost some figures over the 
time, but I am sure that we can play it together. There must be enough 
figures be left for two players.&quot;

At that moment the door was opened and a young man appeared in the 
frame. First he looked confused at Anthy sitting on the bed, watching 
Utena who crept under the bed until only her legs were still visible.

&quot;Still the wonderful, shy girl as always.&quot; He grinned and leaned 
against the door&#39;s frame. Anthy who didn&#39;t see him come, jerked around 
and looked at him. At his messed blonde hairs that touched slightly 
his neck. In two sparkling blue eyes. A bride grin laid on his face. 
He wore dark clothes. Just like Utena&#39;s T-shirt she wore with so much 
pride.

Kei?

Anthy frowned but didn&#39;t dare to ask. He seemed as if he felt like 
being home in Utena&#39;s room.

&quot;Still messy, baka?&quot; he raised his right foot and stared at the socket 
next to it. Lying there next to other dirty clothes. Clothes Anthy 
could slightly remember that Utena wore them yesterday. When she 
carried her to the small village, to the doctor.

&quot;Ah!&quot; Anthy hopped a little bit as the bed moved suddenly. There was 
the sound of knocking and as Utena returned from her journey under her 
bed, she held her hurting head. Searching she looked around but her 
face brightened up as she saw the young man.

&quot;Kei!&quot; She jumped on her feet and ran over to him. To hug him 
extravagantly. Then they clapped their hands and said some strange 
words. It looked like a dance. A dance of a special tribe only they 
belonged to. A welcome dance beneath the welcome fire.

&quot;Kei, I thought you have to work!&quot;

&quot;Not on the weekends, baka.&quot; He grinned and messed her hairs with a 
loving gesture. His eyes shone with deep feelings and Anthy turned her 
head away. To cover Chuchu with the end of the blanket. The little pet 
already fell asleep after he finally got his breakfast. 

&quot;Auntie called me up and I simply had to come. It&#39;s such a long time 
that you were here, baka.&quot;

&quot;Your girlfriend simply let you go?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not my girlfriend any longer.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders as 
Utena looked dismayed. &quot;It simply didn&#39;t work and I have to give in 
that she wasn&#39;t my big love. She argued too much and she never liked 
my music.&quot; He grinned and shrugged again his shoulders. &quot;We decided to 
end our relationship two months ago.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry, Kei.&quot;

&quot;I am not.&quot; He spread his arms and laughed. &quot;I am free again, baka. 
Enough time to make nonsense this summer. At least after six in the 
evening when I don&#39;t have anything to do.&quot; 

Utena smiled and grabbed his right arm. Then she pulled him over to 
the bed. Shortly wondering why Anthy stared so determinedly on her 
bandaged foot.

&quot;May I introduce? That&#39;s Himemiya Anthy, my best friend.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Anthy. I am Kei.&quot;

&quot;The one she knocked over when she swung her fishing rod the first 
time?&quot; Anthy smiled friendly at him but didn&#39;t bow this time. She 
didn&#39;t want to scare Utena again who almost freaked out when she bowed 
before her aunt in the hospital and saw stars afterwards.

&quot;Right, exactly that Kei.&quot; He laughed and sat down next to her. 
Shortly he looked at her foot and frowned.

&quot;And what is that?&quot;

&quot;I slipped on a stone.&quot; Answered Anthy honestly. &quot;But it&#39;s not so bad. 
The doctor says a little bit rest and I&#39;ll be fine again.&quot;

&quot;She tried to save my last chocolate bar.&quot; Groaned Utena and looked 
very guilty. 

&quot;Chocolate bar?&quot; Kei looked over to Utena then to Anthy and back. Then 
he burst out into laughter. &quot;You will never change, don&#39;t you know, 
baka?&quot; he laughed and petted amused Anthy&#39;s right shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t 
laugh about you, Anthy. It&#39;s just that one camping we returned and I 
had a broken nose.&quot; He showed at his nose which was still a little bit 
curved. &quot;It wasn&#39;t her fault anyway. She only wanted to kill a 
mosquito in the middle of the night and that mosquito decided to sit 
down on my nose.&quot; He laughed even louder as Utena blushed deeply and 
turned around to take care for the CD.

&quot;The mosquito survived her attack. Only my nose couldn&#39;t stand back 
her boot. So don&#39;t worry, Anthy, to be that tomboy&#39;s friend means to 
fall down time by time. She&#39;s simply clumsy. And impatient.&quot;

&quot;Only a little bit.&quot; Tried Anthy to defend Utena who searched very 
intensive for another CD.

&quot;A little bit?&quot; Kei laughed again and held his belly. &quot;That&#39;s the 
biggest understatement I ever heard. You should be happy that she 
didn&#39;t break any bone of you. That you are still alive.&quot;

&quot;Kei!&quot;

&quot;What? Isn&#39;t it the truth?&quot;

&quot;You chase away my best friend, Kei!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kei raised his eyebrows and looked at Anthy next to him. 
Smiling so innocently as if she really didn&#39;t hear the humour in his 
words. &quot;Are you really afraid of her now? I mean, she is clumsy, but 
until now she didn&#39;t kill anyone. Until now.&quot; A pillow hit his head 
and laughing he threw it back.

&quot;Kei!&quot;

&quot;We shared a room the past school term.&quot; Answered Anthy and her smile 
deepened. &quot;I know her wardrobe, Kei-san.&quot;

The young man frowned as he heard the formal salutation but had to 
laugh even more as he finally understood the bronze girl&#39;s words.

&quot;Her wardrobe? You mean the big mess where there&#39;s always a bomb 
exploding whenever she opens the door?&quot;

&quot;She improved.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;She put away her airbed.&quot;

&quot;The one she never wanted to let out the air?&quot;

&quot;Hai, but now it&#39;s broken.&quot;

&quot;Wow, I am impressed.&quot;

&quot;AH!&quot; The next moment Utena jumped on the bed and tried to tickle Kei. 
But the young man was taller and soon he sat on her, tickling her 
without mercy.

&quot;Kei! WAH!&quot; she laughed helpless and soon they had a big fight. Like 
in the old days. When they had been teenagers. When Kei fell 
desperately in love with the pink haired girl but she told him that he 
was a good friend, no one more. That he would never be it, no matter 
how long he would wait.

&quot;You little beast.&quot;

&quot;You jerk!&quot;

&quot;Baka!&quot;

&quot;You... wah!&quot;

Anthy brought her hurt foot in security and watched them giggling. She 
had never seen such a crazy family before. She knew that they all only 
teased Utena around. You simply had to tease someone around who 
reacted like Utena did. Her aunt was a loving person and this Kei 
seemed to be nice, too.

I wish I would have such a family, too.

Anthy&#39;s purple eyes darkened and she wrapped her arms around her body 
as she started suddenly to freeze.

I wish I would belong to that family. To her family...

&quot;Your school report?&quot; Kei who still sat on Utena&#39;s back who protested 
loudly, grabbed for the brown book and opened it. His blue eyes grew 
wide with surprised. &quot;What did you do? Did you eat an intelligence 
cake or what? You never had such good marks!&quot;

&quot;So you thought I was stupid? Good for you that you work now, uh?&quot; 
Utena finally turned around and grabbed the book back. She looked at 
it and made a face. &quot;That&#39;s Anthy&#39;s, not mine.&quot; She declared and 
handled it over to the bronze girl who watched them in silence. &quot;This 
is mine.&quot;

&quot;Hai, that looks more like you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I improved!&quot;

&quot;Right, I can see it at your French mark.&quot;

&quot;AH!&quot;

Anthy took her report in her hands and frowned. She couldn&#39;t remember 
to have put it into her rucksack. But here it was. As always. As every 
year. No one would sign it. She knew that there was a field on the 
sheet where the parents had to sign. Anthy had no parents and so no 
one signed it. No teacher seemed to care. They took her book back at 
the beginning of the school term and gave it back to her when the year 
was over.

&quot;Your friend maybe doesn&#39;t have a good sport mark, but...&quot;

&quot;Kei!&quot;

&quot;Baka!&quot;

They both fought again giggling on the bed and Anthy opened her book 
again. To look at her bad sport mark. Even worse than Utena&#39;s French 
mark. 

&quot;Jerk!&quot;

&quot;Little demon!&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes grew wide and watered as she saw that the empty field 
wasn&#39;t empty any longer. Someone had signed it. Someone who was called 
Tenjoh Rinja.

Family...

***

&quot;Are you sure that you can take a shower all by yourself?&quot; Utena 
looked doubtful at her best friend. The smaller girl stood on her 
crutch next to the cabin and looked really determinedly. A plastic bag 
covered her bandaged feet and right now she wore one of Utena&#39;s 
bathrobes. Of course it was too big. Just like Utena&#39;s pyjama Anthy 
would wear afterwards. It was now evening. Kei stayed the whole 
afternoon and they played some games. Anthy joined them and won. 
Because Utena and Kei had to tease each other around the whole time. 
Of course Chuchu had been on Kei&#39;s side in the very instant he awoke 
and so three voices shouted through the room whenever the other one 
got a better card. In the end it had been Anthy who held the best 
cards in her hand without knowing how she got them. Rinja made supper 
for them before she opened her restaurant. There were less guests 
today and so she told Utena that she didn&#39;t have to help her. That she 
should take care for her friend instead. Anthy who felt sweaty and 
dirty after the long day wanted to take a shower and Utena wouldn&#39;t 
leave the bathroom. She feared that the bronze girl would slip on the 
wet underground or that she would suddenly faint. Still she was ill 
and still she had headache.

&quot;Of course. I did that all my life.&quot; Said Anthy but the concern in 
Utena&#39;s voice warmed her heart. She stripped the bathrobe and opened 
her hairs. She wanted to wash them, too. They were still dirty with 
blood on her temple and she felt like a stunk. With unsure steps she 
entered the cabin and closed the door behind her. Soon nice warm water 
ran down her body and she closed her eyes to enjoy it.

Utena leaned against the door as the waterfall increased. She took a 
deep breath and looked out of the opened window. Seeing the dark 
clouds building up on the evening sky. The past days had been 
incredible hot and she knew that another thunderstorm came. Probably 
it would rain the whole night so that it would be very hot again in 
the morning and the following day. As so often during the hot summer 
months.

We need a little bit fresh air.

Utena brushed some hairs out of her sweaty face and blushed even 
deeper. But it was not because of the summer&#39;s heat. She knew that.

Hell, what&#39;s up with you? You&#39;ve seen her naked before! Whenever you 
changed in the sport&#39;s cabin for swimming! Whenever she was under the 
shower in our bathroom at school and you forgot to brush your teeth. 
Whenever she forgot her night grown and searched it half blind, 
because she couldn&#39;t find her glasses. It&#39;s not special! It&#39;s not 
different now! Isn&#39;t it?

She took a deep breath and closed her eyes.

Nothing changed. She&#39;s still the same.

No!

She is different now! Now she is Himemiya Anthy. The Anthy behind the 
Rose Bride&#39;s mask! Finally she shows her real I.

And you like that girl, right?

You like her a lot!

Right?

Right?

Utena sighed deeply and opened her eyes. And jumped over to the cabin 
as she saw how the shadow of Anthy started to reel behind the glass 
door.

&quot;Anthy?&quot; she opened the door and caught the smaller girl as she fell. 
Anthy marbled something and coughed. 

Then she tried to stand up. 

&quot;Everything alright, Tenjoh-san.&quot;

&quot;Forget it, Anthy. Get out before you faint!&quot; Utena tried to pull her 
out. Trying hard to ignore the soft skin under her fingertips. Trying 
hard to ignore her own fast heart beat. &quot;I once promised not to let 
you drown. Not even in our shower!&quot;

&quot;But I am dirty! I didn&#39;t wash my hairs right now.&quot; Whispered Anthy 
and Utena felt how she trembled. A lightening flashed over the dark 
sky outside the window and thunder followed. They both didn&#39;t hear it, 
because the water falling down was too loud. But in the shine of the 
lightening Utena could see the pleading in purple eyes. An expression 
laid on Anthy&#39;s face Utena couldn&#39;t resist.

It had been hot. I should take a shower, too.

Do you really think that this is such a good idea?

Utena gulped and looked shortly at Anthy&#39;s trembling body. She felt 
how she blushed again and was angry about herself.

Do you really think so?

Shut up!

&quot;Just one moment, Anthy. Don&#39;t move, okay?&quot; Utena turned around after 
she made sure that the bronze girl wouldn&#39;t fall down. Then she 
stripped her jeans and her now dirty T-shirt. They ate ice cream in 
the afternoon and of course she had to spread it all over her clothes. 
Kei laughed out loud - before Anthy showed him that he dirtied his 
shirt as well. Chuchu begged the whole time and finally Anthy gave him 
something, too. Happily he had sat on her right shoulder and ate with 
passion. Being petted time by time by Kei who always wanted to have a 
pet but simply didn&#39;t have the time to keep one.

&quot;Tell me before your foot hurts to much, okay?&quot; Utena stepped behind 
the smaller girl in the cabin and closed the glass door behind 
herself. She shivered as she felt the warm water on her body. Anthy 
took her showers much hotter than she did, but she wouldn&#39;t change the 
water&#39;s temperature. This time she would survive it.

This time?

She didn&#39;t think much as she simply took the shampoo and massaged it 
into Anthy&#39;s hairs. Hairs that felt like velvet. Like a violet curtain 
they fell over small shoulders and covered a fragile looking back. I 
will never let anyone hurt you.

Anthy lowered her head and closed her eyes. The world still spun 
around herself, but she tried to live with the dizziness. The touch 
was simply too gently to let it go. Utena was so soft, so loving to 
her no one had ever been before. Carefully her hairs were cleaned from 
the shampoo and the water was turned off.

No, please, not so soon.

Anthy gulped as she heard the thunder rolling outside the opened 
window.

Don&#39;t let me go now!

&quot;Better you&#39;ll go to bed, Anthy. You can hardly stand any more.&quot; 
Utena&#39;s voice was low and sounded concerned. Anthy felt how her hairs 
were wrapped into a towel around her head. 

I don&#39;t want to go to bed.

Another thunder rolled and Anthy winced. She didn&#39;t slip on the 
shower&#39;s underground, but was frightened about the thunderstorm. The 
memory of the heavy thunderstorm at the big lake was too fresh to 
ignore this one. Okay, this time she was in a solid house, but the 
fear was still in her heart. 

&quot;Anthy, keep awake!&quot; yelled Utena suddenly who thought that the taller 
girl would faint. She embraced her and held her tight as Anthy winced. 
&quot;Hey, keep awake!&quot;

Anthy opened her eyes as she felt the warm body beside her. As she 
felt strong arms embracing her. As she felt Utena&#39;s warm breath in her 
neck.

&quot;I am fine.&quot; She whispered and wondered why her voice was suddenly so 
hoarse.

She&#39;s so soft. So incredible cute. So sweet...

Utena coughed and finally let the smaller girl go. Not knowing why her 
arms shook with a sudden. She reached for the towel and handled it 
Anthy who squinted. Her glasses laid in Utena&#39;s room on the table and 
she was almost blind right now. 

What&#39;s up with me?

Utena grabbed angrily her own towel and dried herself. Then she 
dressed herself quickly in her clothes and handled Anthy the pyjama. 
It was really too tall. 

&quot;I am a real dwarf, right?&quot;

Utena smiled although she knew that Anthy probably didn&#39;t see it. She 
bowed down to roll up the pyjama&#39;s pants.

&quot;No, Anthy, I am a real giant.&quot;

They both giggled and Utena asked herself if the shower had really 
been so hot as she helped Anthy to get over to her room on the crutch.

***

&quot;I am a lumberjack and I am okay
I sleep all night and I work all day
I want to be a girlie
Just like my dear papa...&quot;

Utena turned the TV set louder and laughed while she watched the young 
man being dressed as a lumberjack dancing over the screen. The choir 
looked very unsure but repeated his words.

&quot;Those guys are so funny!&quot; she laughed even louder and wiped away the 
tears from the corner of her eyes. She sat on the corner of her bed 
and gasped for breath as a serious looking man went into a cheese 
office to buy cheese. But the shop didn&#39;t have cheese.

&quot;I wish they would have made more movies like this one.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Anthy answered only half hearted. She sat in the middle of the bed, 
being wrapped in a soft blanket. Her violet hairs were still damp. 
They had been not very tired after they finished their shower and so 
Utena decided to watch TV. Her most favourite series. A very funny one 
with a dark kind of humour. The best humour of them all: British one. 
But Anthy couldn&#39;t laugh. She didn&#39;t even giggle. Not even smile. All 
she did while Utena almost fell down the bed while that guy did 
something even funnier was to look to the still opened window. Seeing 
all the lightening that crossed the dark sky outside. The thunderstorm 
started one hour ago and the horizon looked worse with every minute. 
The wind increased outside and the leaves of the trees around the 
house rushed threatening. Still it was very hot, but Anthy froze like 
hell. Her legs she covered completely with the blanket were ice cold 
and she shivered slightly.

This is only a thunderstorm!

You are in a solid house now!

But it didn&#39;t help. Anthy had never felt comfortable with the 
dangerous forces of nature. Since that night at the lake she disliked 
thunderstorms even more. Okay, that night, there had been someone 
right by her side.

Anthy glanced over to Utena who brushed her hairs out of her blushed 
face and laughed again as a young man declared to climb both peaks of 
the Kilimanjaro.

Okay, Utena would be there this night, too, but she would sleep again 
on the ground. Unreachable for Anthy when she would lay half blind in 
the darkness, listening to the strange noises around her. Wondering 
how long it would take to let this night be over. Finally over.

The wind increased and the window frame crashed against the wall. 
Anthy winced hard while Utena jerked around. Still laughing over a 
strange football game between injured patients and doctors she stood 
up and closed it. Then she glanced at her watch and yawned slightly.

&quot;What do you think? Shall we go to bed? It&#39;s late, Anthy.&quot;

The bronze girl only nodded, not knowing what to say, how to reply. Of 
course they couldn&#39;t watch TV the whole night. But somehow she had 
hoped so. She had never been afraid of the dark, but when nature raged 
so loudly outside she felt very unsure and fragile. Tiny and helpless. 
A feeling she had often when she was the Rose Bride. A feeling she 
hated even more when she was only Himemiya Anthy.

&quot;Let&#39;s watch the rest tomorrow, okay? Kei even knows that movie by 
heart.&quot; Utena giggled and switched off the TV set. &quot;Goodnight, little 
demon.&quot; Utena stroke behind Chuchu&#39;s ears. The little pet only turned 
around on the pillow next to Anthy and kept sleeping. He was full, 
warm and simply satisfied. No one argued with him, only the pink 
haired girl teased him around. But she liked him, he felt it. She 
wasn&#39;t as mean as Saionji who even stepped on him one time.

&quot;Good night, Anthy. If you need something, just wake me up. If your 
foot is hurting or you want something to drink, just throw a pillow 
after me. Or a book when I am deep asleep.&quot; Utena grinned and raised 
her hand. Automatically she caressed bronze cheeks and looked deeply 
into purple eyes. &quot;If you need anything, just call me, Anthy, okay?&quot;

The smaller girl gulped and finally nodded again.

&quot;Okay.&quot; She whispered and placed her hand over the one on her left 
cheek. For some moments they froze and didn&#39;t dare to move. Looking at 
each other. Dreamy. Then Utena let go and turned towards her blankets 
on the ground. They were hard, but comfortable enough for Utena who 
was used to hard underground because of all the vacations she took 
part of. It was her fault that Anthy got injured and so she thought it 
was just fair that the injured girl would get the bed and she the 
ground instead.

&quot;Good night, Tenjoh-san.&quot;

Utena bit on her lower lip as she switched off the light.

Utena!

My name is Utena!

But she didn&#39;t say a word. She knew it was senseless. Anthy hardly 
called her by her Christian name. Only when she was in great pain or 
need or didn&#39;t even know that she was talking to her. And when she 
did, she blushed. As if it was forbidden for the Rose Bride to say her 
groom&#39;s normal name.

Anthy heard how her best friend laid down and gulped. And gulped 
again. Another lightening crossed the sky, split the enormous clouds. 
Thunder followed. It didn&#39;t rain. Not yet. It had been too hot this 
day and still the rain was missing. The clouds had still to built up 
and sent its harbinger first.

I wanna get out here!

But Anthy was like paralysed. Like she had been in the small tent. 
This time the walls didn&#39;t shake around her. Nevertheless was the 
feeling almost as worse as the last time. The trees looked like dark, 
dangerous shadows outside the window and she felt alone. Suddenly very 
alone.

Please...

She took a deep breath and crossed her arms before her chest. Her foot 
start again to hurt. She took her medicine one hour ago but each day 
she was only allowed to take a little bit less. They went to a doctor 
here and he told her that her foot was getting better and that there 
was no need to pump her full with pain killers.

Right now she wished herself a big aspirin.

&quot;Tenjoh-san?&quot; Anthy was surprised that she was still able to talk. 
Mostly when she wanted to yell, her throat was dry and she wasn&#39;t even 
able to whimper. Right now it was only a silent whisper, but the pink 
haired girl answered immediately.

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Are you still awake?&quot;

&quot;What would you do if I&#39;d say no?&quot;

&quot;That you aren&#39;t a good liar.&quot;

Utena giggled and sat up. Rubbing her eyes and staring through the 
darkness over to the bed. Anthy still sat there, leaned against her 
pillows. It seems as if she didn&#39;t move during the past minutes at 
all.

&quot;What&#39;s up, Anthy?&quot; Utena yawned deeply and searched for her pillow. 
Only minutes had passed since she switched off the light. But those 
minutes had been enough to transform her ground bed to a total mess. 
Just like her hairs. &quot;Is your foot hurting?&quot;

&quot;A little bit.&quot; Replied Anthy in a very calm voice and gulped.

Why did you wake her up again?

What do you want now?

Anthy blinked in the darkness. She knew too well what she wanted. She 
knew that since the day when the pink haired girl won the duel. But 
she knew that it was only a dream. Maybe out of the Rose Bride&#39;s duty, 
maybe out of Himemiya Anthy&#39;s heart. Utena told her more than once 
that she didn&#39;t believe in all this end of the world nonsense. That 
she fought all those duels to keep her away from those insane 
duellists like Saionji who was so brutal that he didn&#39;t even deserve a 
fish or a hamster.

&gt;If you need anything, just call me, Anthy, okay?&lt;

But she offered me her help.

Hai, only her help.

&quot;Shall I get you some more medicine? You don&#39;t have to take it 
forever, so it&#39;s not that bad when you take a little bit more today.&quot;

You see? Medicine, nothing more.

Shut up!

Again lightening brightened up the room and the thunder that followed 
was very loud. The window was pushed open by the storm and Anthy 
winced hard as the frame crashed again against the wall. Utena jumped 
cursing on her feet and closed it. This time hopefully properly.

&quot;Hope auntie closes all doors and let our doggy in. He&#39;s not afraid of 
thunderstorms, but he tries to attack every lightening as if it were 
an enemy.&quot; Utena chuckled. &quot;He&#39;s a little bit stupid, but a lovely 
dog.&quot;

Anthy who already got to know the big, impatient but always begging 
dog. He growled at her first, but when he recognized that she held a 
roll with cheese in her hands, he was suddenly her best friend. 
Looking the whole time at her breakfast. Lying his head in her lap and 
staring with loyal eyes up to her. Or at least up to her hand. Happily 
he had barked when she gave him the last part. Since that moment they 
were deep friends and he even accepted a still very frightened Chuchu 
who rescued himself on Anthy&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Do you have fever?&quot; Utena&#39;s voice was very concerned as she sat down 
on the bed. Anthy didn&#39;t react as she felt the warm hand on her 
forehead. &quot;Nope.&quot;

Now or never!

Just say what you want!

She will tell you if she doesn&#39;t want it!

Or do you want to spend the whole night in fear, listening to this 
dangerous thunder outside?

Do you want?

Do you want?

Do you want?

No...

&quot;Would...&quot; stammered Anthy and lowered her head. &quot;Would you... would 
you please hold me... Utena? Be... because I am afraid of 
thunderstorms...&quot; Anthy gulped and silence filled the room after her 
words. Only the storm hammering against the window was heard. And 
Chuchu&#39;s snores.

Nani?

Utena felt how her cheeks burned and cursed herself. Why did she blush 
again? There was no reason for blushing! Anthy only asked her to stay. 
To protect her against the thunderstorm. Just another thunderstorm. 
Like in the tent. Nothing special. How often did she ask her aunt to 
sleep in her bed after her parents died? When nightmares were hunting 
her down? Why did she feel so embarrassed right now? This was normal! 
Anthy was her best friend and she was afraid. Maybe even in pain 
because of that stupid chocolate bar! Wasn&#39;t it normal to help a 
friend in need?

Wasn&#39;t it?

Wasn&#39;t it?

Wasn&#39;t it?

I don&#39;t know...

&quot;Of course.&quot; Answered Utena and blushed even deeper as her voice died 
away and she had to cough. She crept under the blanket and took the 
smaller girl carefully in her arms. She felt how Anthy trembled and 
brought her a little bit nearer to her body. Feeling that her arms 
shook a little bit, too.

&quot;Just... just until I sleep, okay? Then you can go back to your bed if 
you like...&quot;

&quot;And to waste this nice, soft one? To waste an opportunity not to 
sleep on the ground?&quot; teased Utena and cursed as she saw how Anthy&#39;s 
eyes grew wide.

&quot;When... when it&#39;s too hard on the ground, why do you give me your bed 
then, Tenjoh-san? I could go in one of your aunt&#39;s guest rooms as 
well.&quot;

&quot;Because I want it this way!&quot; answered Utena and sighed slightly. 
&quot;This was only a joke, Anthy. Besides, nothing is more funny than to 
sleep with someone in one room and to tell that person horror 
stories.&quot;

They both remembered Utena&#39;s last attempt of being a ghost and both 
giggled a little bit.

&quot;Better not this night, Tenjoh-san. Or I would have to search you in 
your garden... hobbling.&quot;

&quot;No, here are my neighbours. Well, they ARE used to my strange 
behaviour sometimes, but to ran outside a thunderstorm, only wearing a 
white blanket and moaning like a ghost... they would call the doctors 
and they would give me nice white jackets. You know, those with the 
long sleeves.&quot;

&quot;Oh... may I get one, too? They always look so soft.&quot; Anthy leaned her 
head against Utena&#39;s chest and could hear the regular heartbeat. First 
it was fast, surely because of the effort of closing the window, but 
it slowed down quickly. It was the best rhythm Anthy had ever heard. 
It was calming, comforting. It surrounded her and let her forget the 
thunderstorm outside the window. It made her sleepy and she yawned 
slightly. Feeling completely safe here in those soft arms. In Utena&#39;s 
tender embracement.

&quot;You know those jackets?&quot;

&quot;Saionji owns one.&quot;

&quot;I am sure he does.&quot; Giggled Utena and Anthy could feel her warm 
breath tickling her neck. Soft hands started to caress her violet 
curls and smiling she closed her eyes.

I wish I could stay this way forever.

Please, let me be able to stop time.

I never want to go back to that school again. I never want to be their 
Bride again. I never want to break that gentle touch ever again...

&quot;I am sure that his room has so soft walls and a soft ground.&quot; Kept 
Utena giggling and moved a little bit. So that they both could lay a 
little bit more comfortable. &quot;Iek! Your legs are pure ice, Anthy.&quot; 
Screamed Utena silently the next moment and Anthy felt warm legs 
carefully touching her cold ones. &quot;I told you that you shouldn&#39;t make 
vacations in our fridge, no matter how hot the day had been.&quot;

&quot;Gomen nasai, Tenjoh-san.&quot;

Utena sighed slightly and felt how arms were hesitantly wrapped around 
her waist. Every touch was electrifying. Suddenly the pink haired girl 
asked how they could have been classmates, even roommates for almost 
the whole past term without.. without having hold each other that way. 
There had been so many moments when Anthy had been sad. When Utena had 
been sad, too, but didn&#39;t want to show it. There had been some 
thunderstorms, too. In autumn. Not as heavy as that one, but Anthy 
never told her that she was afraid of them. 

It feels so right, it can&#39;t be wrong. Can it?

&quot;It told you to call me Utena. Is that so hard, Anthy?&quot; whispered the 
tall girl and yawned slightly. It had been a long, exciting day. 
Especially with Kei around. The crazy Kei who always had his head full 
with nonsense. He even made Anthy giggle and after some tries he was 
friend with Chuchu. A chocolate cookie played an important role during 
those moments.

&quot;No... hai...&quot; admitted Anthy finally and shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I 
am only the Rose Bride and...&quot;

&quot;You are Himemiya Anthy.&quot; Interrupted her Utena and kept caressing 
those soft hairs. They felt like velvet. The tall girl could remember 
too well how surprised she had been when she saw Anthy the first time 
with opened hairs. She hadn&#39;t expected them to be so long. Without her 
glasses and with her long hairs Anthy liked completely different. Like 
another person. But Utena liked the normal Anthy with her school 
uniform and her typical hairdo the same. Only the Rose Bride, Utena 
didn&#39;t want to accept that nonsense. The same she didn&#39;t want to 
accept their so called engagement.

I don&#39;t want to have someone who hangs around with me because she 
thinks she has to!

&quot;You are my friend, right? And friends don&#39;t call each other -san.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Anthy gulped. Then she yawned again. It was amazing how quickly 
her body calmed down. How warming and comforting Utena&#39;s voice could 
be. How loving her tender strokes. &quot;Guess you are right, Tenj... 
Utena.&quot; It was hard for her. After all those months. To say it and to 
be aware of it.

&quot;That sounds better, Anthy.&quot; Whispered the tall girl and leaned 
forward. Softly she placed a kiss on Anthy&#39;s forehead before she 
leaned back and closed her eyes. &quot;Good night, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Good night, Tenj... Utena.&quot;

The tall girl hugged her for one last time and soon her breath got 
more regularly as Utena drifted into sleep. Anthy herself couldn&#39;t. 
Her forehead burned but she didn&#39;t dare to move. Deeply blushed she 
stayed in that tender embracement, burying her burning face on a soft 
shoulder. Hearing the other one&#39;s calming heartbeat while her own 
heart raced.

Suddenly the thunderstorm outside was unimportant.

She really stayed here. With me. She really cared for me. For me and 
not for the Rose Bride she&#39;s engaged to. For me, me, Himemiya Anthy...

Not so the thunderstorm in her heart.

***

&quot;Utena? Anthy? Breakfast is...&quot; Rinja opened the door and rushed into 
the room. But she quietened as she saw the two girls lying on the bed. 
Both being fast asleep. Anthy&#39;s arms were wrapped around Utena&#39;s 
waist. Probably in the weak attempt to cover the other girl with the 
blanket, too. Utena&#39;s hairs were messed and she smiled in her sleep. 
There was no trace any more of the nightmares that haunted the tall 
girl down so often. Even ten years after her parent&#39;s death. She 
didn&#39;t tell anyone, but Rinja noticed it. They didn&#39;t live in one 
house without noticing such things.

She looks happy.

Rinja stepped over to the window and closed the curtains. To cover the 
room with a nice twilight that would give them some more hours of 
sleep.

Just like the little one.

Anthy smiled, too. There were traces of tears on her cheeks and Rinja 
remembered Utena telling her that Anthy was afraid of thunderstorms. 
The last night there had been a real bad thunderstorm. Surely the 
bronze girl had been afraid and searched for protection in Utena&#39;s 
embracement. The same Utena searched for comfort in Rinja&#39;s arms when 
she had been just six years old.

Who is that girl, Utena?

Rinja stepped over to the bed and helped them to cover both of their 
bodies with the soft blanket. Utena&#39;s laid of course somewhere on the 
ground.

&quot;Is it already morning?&quot; whispered the pink haired girl and made a 
face. She didn&#39;t open her eyes, was not really awake yet.

&quot;Keep sleeping, junior. I&#39;ll wake you up for lunch, okay?&quot; whispered 
Rinja and stroke through pink hairs. Utena sighed relieved and buried 
her face in violet curls. Her right hand caressed slowly a bronze arm. 
Soon she was back in her dreamland.

Who is Anthy, Utena? Simply a good friend of yours? Like Kei?

But Rinja couldn&#39;t remember of ever having seen Kei and Utena in a 
situation like that one. 

Who is that girl, Utena? Your girlfriend?

Rinja sighed and leaned forward and stroke over bronze cheeks. The 
smile deepened even on a peaceful face.

Whoever she is, Utena, you know that you are always welcome here. Just 
like your friends. You are my only family, little one.

The tall woman turned around and silently left the room. Knowing that 
she would wait her niece to come to her. To talk to her. Maybe about 
Anthy, maybe about someone else some day. Whoever it would be Utena 
would bring home as her partner, Rinja swore herself a long time ago 
that she would like that person. As long as the one would make her 
nice, her little Utena happy. As happy as she hadn&#39;t been after her 
parents died. As happy as she was whenever she was together with the 
silent, but very friendly Anthy.
