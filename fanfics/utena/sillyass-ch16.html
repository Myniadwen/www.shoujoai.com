<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 16 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        &quot;Are you sure it&#39;s a Clow card?&quot; Sakura asked breathlessly, 
running as fast as she could. Kero zipped along beside the brown 
haired girl, while Tomoyo followed them a few steps behind, filming 
everything that happened.

        &quot;Puu!&quot; Mokona bounced along quite happily, the bunny-thing 
keeping ahead of the three of them with remarkable ease.

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure what it is,&quot; Kero admitted, the miniature golden 
lion trying it&#39;s absolute best to keep up with them.

        &quot;It&#39;s certainly unusual,&quot; Tomoyo said, the black haired girl 
adding with a broad smile, &quot;I&#39;m sure it will make a great capture to 
film, though!&quot;

        Sakura sweatdropped.

        Mokona bounded over to three young ladies, leaping up into the 
shortest girl&#39;s arms. &quot;Puu!&quot; it exclaimed, and the redhead seemed to 
understand what it was saying.

        Hikaru smiled at the three of them, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Hikaru, this is 
Umi and Fuu.&quot; She gestured to her two friends, then said, &quot;Mokona says 
you were playing tag?&quot;

        Sakura sweatdropped, &quot;Well, something like that.&quot; She pointed 
at the happily &#39;Puu!&#39; -ing creature in the girl&#39;s arms, &quot;What is 
that?&quot;

        &quot;This is Mokona,&quot; Umi said with a sigh, the blue haired girl 
obviously not too terribly thrilled with the bunny creature.

        Umi shrugged as she explained, &quot;We&#39;re not entirely sure what 
it actually is.&quot; The blonde smiled cheerfully, &quot;It followed us home, 
or at least wherever we are now.&quot; She looked pointedly around at the 
Ohtori campus.

        &quot;Hikaru!&quot; the little redhead was hit by a hug from behind.

        &quot;Presia?&quot; Hikaru blinked at the weapon master of Cephiro, 
&quot;what are you doing here?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve missed you!&quot; Presia snuggled in close.

        Umi looked dangerous, &quot;Get away from our Hikaru!&quot;

        &quot;Our Hikaru?&quot; Fuu raised her eyebrow.

        Umi gave her a stern look, &quot;We can settle our differences 
later, for now we just need to get her away from Hikaru!&quot;

        &quot;Sounds reasonable,&quot; Fuu agreed, and both women began to 
advance on Presia.

        &quot;I think we should leave,&quot; Tomoyo whispered to Sakura.

        Sakura nodded upon seeing the two very pissed off girls, &quot;Good 
idea!&quot; They collared Kero and fled as quickly as possible, hearing the 
sounds of great violence starting up behind them.

        Sonomi sighed, looking down from an upper floor window as her 
daughter and Sakura walked on by, holding hands. &#39;They look so cute 
together, just like Nadeshico and I once did,&#39; the business woman 
thought to herself sadly.

        She looked about her cramped office and Sonomi scowled 
angrily. It was so difficult to do business, trapped here in Ohtori. 
Reaching all her business interests were nearly impossible, not to 
mention the general incompetence of the people around her.

        And then there was her other little problem...

        &quot;Chii?&quot; the persocom asked her quietly.

        Chii, as Sonomi had come to call her, had been following her 
around ever since she had found Chii abandoned in an alleyway. The 
white-blonde haired artificial girl was pleasant, had a warm 
personality, and was annoyingly persistent. She simply refused to 
leave Sonomi alone, and to make matters worse, there was her taste in 
clothes.

        &quot;Oh, god,&quot; Sonomi muttered, seeing that Chii was just dressed 
in a nearly transparent gown again. &#39;Must think pure thoughts...&#39; she 
commanded herself silently.

        &quot;Chii?&quot; she tilted her head to the side.

        Sonomi looked at her a moment, an odd expression on her face. 
&quot;To hell with it,&quot; she finally sighed, and tackled Chii to the office 
floor.

        A short time later, a very happy &quot;Chii!&quot; could be heard.

        In another part of campus two young women looked about, 
completely lost. The tall one grabbed at a boys arm, and he started to 
say something, &quot;Wha..&quot; The boy stopped, chilled by the glare the woman 
was giving him.

        &quot;Where is the Angelic Layer stadium?&quot; Sai Jounouchi asked him, 
giving him the sort of look that had earned her the nickname, &#39;the ice 
machine.&#39;

        The wide eyed boy blurted, &quot;I have no idea what your talking 
about.&quot;

        With a sigh Sai let him go, then the tall, light brown haired 
woman felt a gentle hand come to rest on her arm.

        Kaede Saitou smiled up at Sai, &quot;It&#39;s all right, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll 
find it eventually.&quot;

        &#39;It was strange,&#39; Sai thought to herself, &#39;how that smile 
always seems to calm my temper, no matter what seems to be going on.&#39; 
A fleeting smile appeared on her face, &#39;I guess she really is the girl 
with the healing smile.&#39;

        &quot;Excuse me!&quot; a girl in a swimsuit skateboarded on by them, a 
cute little bunny&#39;s tail attached to her bottom, rabbit ears on her 
head.

        &quot;Come back,&quot; a cute brown haired girl cried, chasing after 
her.

        &quot;Miyuki-chan,&quot; a woman dressed all in red leather cried as she 
chased after the other two, &quot;lick my boots!&quot; She noticed Sai and Kaede 
there, and skidded to a stop. &quot;Well, well,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;what 
have we here?&quot;

        Sai pushed Kaede behind her even as she said, &quot;Nothing that 
concerns you.&quot;

        The leather clad queen and Sai gazed into each others&#39; eyes, a 
stare- down contest of very high stakes. It grew silent all around 
them, Sai matching her intensity with her own cool gaze. Finally the 
woman in red gave Sai a respectful little nod, before returning to her 
chase.

        &quot;What was that all about?&quot; Kaede whispered.

        Sai smiled slightly as she admitted, &quot;I have no idea.&quot;

Authors Notes: I&#39;ll probably be adding to this later on, after I&#39;ve 
done a bit more research. For instance, I haven&#39;t seen Tokyo Babylon, 
I&#39;ve only seen a bit of X 1999, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other Clamp 
series I haven&#39;t even heard of yet. Plus, I haven&#39;t featured Miss Door 
yet...

Appearing this Episode: Sakura, Tomoyo and Sonomi are all from 
Cardcaptor Sakura. Hikaru, Umi, Fuu and Presia are from Magic Knight 
Rayearth. Chii is from Chobits. Sai Jounouchi and Kaede Saitou are 
from Angelic Layer. And finally, Miyuki-chan, Miss Bunny and the Red 
Queen are from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland.
