<a href="../utena/captain-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Utena stood uncomfortably in the middle of the livingroom. She was 
being fitted into her dress uniform as quickly as possible, with 
Juri&#39;s able assistance. And occasional commentary.

&quot;You&#39;re face looks awfully white,&quot; Juri remarked, a impish smile on 
her face. She had seen Utena run out of the bedroom earlier and Juri 
had a pretty good idea what she had seen there.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Utena said, jolted back to reality by Juri&#39;s question. Her 
mind had been dwelling on what she had just seen, no matter how hard 
she tried not to. In her command voice she asked, &quot;Juri, is there 
anyone attending tonight I need to be aware of?&quot;

Juri instantly was back into her second-in-comand mode. &quot;There will 
probaly be three we need to watch for,&quot; Juri said as she helped Utena 
into her dress coat over the white shirt and pants, &quot;Ruka, Saionji and 
Kanae.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard of Ruka,&quot; Utena admitted. Juri tensed, though Utena didn&#39;t 
understand why. &quot;He&#39;s a profesional duelist,&quot; Utena continued, 
&quot;fighting for money. He tricks you into challenging him, he chooses to 
fight to the death, and kills the target.&quot;

Juri nodded. &quot;He was also a former guard,&quot; she said to Utena 
reluctantly, &quot;and we have some... history between us.&quot; Utena looked at 
her with a raised eyebrow, but she doesn&#39;t elaborate.

&quot;And the others?&quot; Utena asked, desciding not to press the issue.

&quot;Saionji is noble born, and he was caught attempting to rape a serving 
girl here. Wakaba, in fact,&quot; Juri said grimly. &quot;The Princess expelled 
him from court, but he bought the title of another lord and was able 
to return. He&#39;s been keeping his nose clean since then, however.&quot;

Juri sighed softly, &quot;Kanae was Akio&#39;s last betrothed, before he was 
finally exiled. She hates Anthy with a fiery passion, and would kill 
her herself if she thought she could get away with it.&quot;

&quot;Great, just great,&quot; Utena sighed. &quot;Are the guards ready?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got the extra people in place,&quot; Juri assured her. &quot;I doubt they 
would risk such a public move, but we&#39;re ready if they try.&quot;

Before Utena could say anymore, Anthy stepped out of the bedroom, a 
sweet smile on her beautiful face. The long white dress swirled around 
her, but she kept one hand on the bodice, holding it in place. &quot;I sent 
my maid on an errand,&quot; Anthy said, smiling at them, &quot;so I was 
wondering, could one of you lace me?&quot;

She turned, revealing the open back of her dress and not incidentally 
the top of her pink panties, right up her corsetted back, amd all the 
way to her lacey bra. Both Juri and Utena gulped audibly in the nearly 
silent room, before Utena managed to croak out &quot;I&#39;d be glad to help.&quot; 
Anthy pulled her long hair up out of the way and Utena gently grasped 
the lacings up her back, pulling them tight. She secured the laces up 
at the neck, and Anthy quickly turned in her arms.

&quot;Thank you so much, Utena,&quot; Anthy said, smiling up at Utena&#39;s face. 
She went up on tip-toe and softly brushed her lips across Utena&#39;s own 
before retreating with an impish smile to her bedroom.

&quot;Way to go, Utena,&quot; Juri said to her with a broad grin on her face. 
She began to softly whistle a popular wedding tune.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have some guard duties to attend to before the party?&quot; 
Utena asked Juri pointedly. Juri grinned at her and sauntered off, but 
not before stopping and straightening Utena&#39;s uniform.



Utena and Anthy stood at the Great Hall&#39;s doors, pausing there a 
moment. Utena nervously adjusted her dress uniform&#39;s collar, and said 
to Anthy nervously &quot;I&#39;ve rarely been to court diners. Can you keep me 
out of trouble please?&quot;

Anthy smiled up at Utena, her long gown sweeping gently around her. 
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; she said with a gentle smile. She nodded to the 
guard standing there, and he pushed the doors open.

&quot;Princess Anthy Ohtori,&quot; the pageboy anounced loudly, &quot;and her 
companion, Captain Utena Tenjou!&quot; Every eye in the room turned to 
them, and Utena had to fight the urge to glare at the poor page.

There weren&#39;t too many people in the ballroom, only about fifty or so. 
Utena found herself tracking the movements of several of them, and was 
pleasantly surprised to notice a friend in the crowd. Juri wore a 
man&#39;s suit, and cut a very fine figure indeed as she made her way over 
to them. At least, many admiring ladies of the court seemed to think 
so. &quot;Anthy, Utena, so glad you could make it,&quot; Juri said, smiling 
charmingly.

&quot;I keep forgetting you&#39;re a noble lady,&quot; Utena said softly, recieving 
several glares from several young ladies who wanted to talk to Juri.

&quot;I&#39;m certain my family wishes they could forget,&quot; Juri answered her 
wryly. &quot;But my father couldn&#39;t get away from some problems at his 
western holdings, so...&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;Are any of my brother&#39;s cronies gracing us with their presence?&quot; 
Anthy asked Juri quietly.

&quot;Kanae, Saionji and Ruka, as we expected,&quot; Juri answered softly, 
discretely pointing out three figures standing close together.

Anthy nodded, then looked up at Utena, &quot;I&#39;ll introduce you, of 
course.&quot; She rolled her eyes, &quot;They&#39;re such lovely company.&quot;

&quot;Juri&#39;s told me about your brother&#39;s allies, but why do you allow...?&quot; 
Utena started to ask.

&quot;There&#39;s no solid proof they were involved with any of my dear 
brother&#39;s plots,&quot; Anthy said with a small, weary sigh. &quot;And they are 
far too well connected to exile or try to question them.&quot;

Utena made a face, &quot;I understand.&quot; She sighed a little, adding &quot;You 
know, I really hate politics.&quot;

Anthy smiled up at her, &quot;Doesn&#39;t one of your philosophers say &#39;War is 
merely an extension of politics.&#39; Utena?&quot;

Utena looked down at her admiringly, &quot;You have been reading my books 
again, I see. Should I be concerned?&quot;

Anthy blushed a bit, remembering a more rique novel she had been 
browsing through. &quot;We will need to circulate,&quot; Anthy said softly, 
blushing a bit harder under Utena&#39;s admiring gaze.

&quot;Juri, could you keep your eyes open?&quot; Utena asked her.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Juri said with a respectful nod. &quot;The guards are also in 
position, as you ordered.&quot;

&quot;I noticed a few very familiar looking pages,&quot; Anthy said smiling. &quot;I 
take it some of the more presentable guards are doing double duty?&quot; 
she whispered.

Utena smiled impishly, as a very busy Tsuwabuki ran by them in a 
pageboy outfit, carrying a full tray of drinks. &quot;All clear,&quot; he 
reported, and then moved off in response to the waves of a very drunk 
lady. Utena noticed that the general response to his presence in any 
of the small crowds seemed to be a cheerful &#39;he&#39;s so cute!&#39;, something 
that no doubt irked him to no end.

A line quickly formed, and Anthy shook hands and smiled as she moved 
down it, Utena watching warily as she stood at her side. She endured 
the speculative gazes she recieved, instead concentrating on her three 
potential threats.

Saionji sneered coldly as he shook Anthy&#39;s hand, his long green hair 
flowing down his back. Ruka watched the crowd coldly, weighing each 
member of the crowd for their potential threat. His eyes crossed 
Utena&#39;s, and it was like the crossing of blades. Kanae, her pale green 
hair falling limply into her eyes, continued to drink glass after 
glass of spirits, as if to dull some long carried pain.

Each paid their respects under Utena&#39;s unforgiving gaze, and if they 
had any pointed comments to make, they wisely decided to keep them to 
themselves. They then moved to the dinner table, where many local 
dishes were being served. &quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;do you have a 
food taster?&quot;

The Princess grimaced slightly and asked quietly &quot;Is that really 
necessary?&quot; Utena was quite impressed by Anthy&#39;s ability to softly 
speak without apparently moving her lips! Her comments came right out 
of a unmoving, charming smile!

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Utena said, not very apologetically, &quot;but I think it&#39;s 
needed.&quot;

The guard at the dore spoke up, announcing another late arrival &quot;Mage 
Takatsuki Shiori, Late of the Skybolts and the Kethry/Tarma school!&quot;

Shiori still looked a little pale, but it offset her dark colored gown 
perfectly, her hair teases and styled to fall over her shoulders. The 
scanned the room like a huntress looking for her prey, smiling when 
she saw it at last.

Juri stood rooted to the spot as the vision of beauty walked slowly 
through the crowds towards her... </pre>
