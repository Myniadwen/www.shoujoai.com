<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 6 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Hikaru looked around the campus with a deeply confused expression on 
her face. &quot;We&#39;re back in the real world, aren&#39;t we?&quot; she turned and 
asked the others plaintively, her short red hair blowing a bit in the 
breeze.

Umi looked around as well, and Fuu nodded thoughtfully. &quot;It certainly 
looks that way,&quot; Fuu said.

&quot;So why are we still in armor?&quot; Hikaru asked looking down at her 
armored version of her school girl&#39;s uniform. &quot;And just look!&quot; Hikaru 
gestured dramatically, and with a swirl of red light, her sword 
appeared in her hand.

A small crowd of Ohtori&#39;s residents, who were drawn in by the prospect 
of entertaining new arrivals, broke into spontaneous applause! Hikaru 
looked about, blushing, then flourished her sword in the air.

&quot;Hikaru,&quot; Umi forcefully whispered, &quot;stop playing with your sword in 
public!&quot; Hikaru blushed a bit, and with another gesture returned the 
blade to the magic stone. The crowd made a disappointed noise, and 
dispersed.

Before they could say anything else, they were interrupted by a woman 
yelling loudly! &quot;Get your hands off of me! Put me down!&quot; Utena yelled 
from the shoulders of the madly running group aproaching the Magic 
Knights. The Red Queen ignored her, as did the Mad Tea Party, Miss 
Door, and the Cheshire Cat as they were a little too busy running for 
their lives trying to get away from the whip cracking Miyuki-chan, who 
looked like she was gaining!

&quot;Stand still for your whipping of love!&quot; the leather clad Miyuki-chan 
cried kawaiily! They sweatdropped and ran faster.

The three watched the group run by, and sweatdropped as well. &quot;Some of 
them, they look kind of familiar,&quot; Fuu said in thoughtful tones, 
&quot;almost as if we were all created, or at least designed by, the same 
group of people...&quot;

Umi looked more nervous. &quot;Don&#39;t say crazy things like that,&quot; she said 
softly. &#39;Still,&#39; she thought, &#39;we do sort of look alike...&#39; She shook 
her head. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Umi asked frowning.

&quot;Register for classes?&quot; Fuu suggested reasonably.

Umi sweatdropped, while Hikaru jumped up and down happily in her cat- 
girl mode. &quot;I meant,&quot; Umi asked them in a dangerous tone of voice, 
&quot;what do we do about getting home?&quot; Hikaru and Fuu just looked at each 
other, then shrugged expressively. &quot;Great,&quot; Umi sighed, &quot;just great.&quot;

Digimon!

Rika and Renamon stood together, looking at the distortion in space 
swirling ahead of them. &quot;Renamon,&quot; Rika asked her eagerly, &quot;do you 
think it might be a way home?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Rika,&quot; Renamon said in her soft, but strong voice. &quot;It 
may eventually become a portal, but for now...&quot; she trailed off and 
looked over at Rika fondly. They had come alone to the digital world 
by an accident, a twist of fate, and Renamon cherished the time she 
had spent here with Rika, just the two of them. She almost didn&#39;t want 
it to end, but she knew Rika was missed by her friends and family.

&quot;Time to try something lame,&quot; Rika said with a sigh. She pointed her 
digivice at the distortion and loudly cried out &quot;Digi-port! Open!&quot; 
Renamon gave her an odd look, and Rika shrugged, &quot;Hey, it worked in 
the TV series.&quot;

The distortion suddenly widened, expanding outward until it revealed 
green fields just beyond it and a very shocked group of people nearby! 
&quot;It is a portal,&quot; Renamon murmured, and took a few steps forward only 
to stop abruptly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Renamon?&quot; Rika asked, body poised to move forward or 
back, depending on Renamon&#39;s next few words.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t feel like it did when I was on Earth, but I&#39;m not sure...&quot; 
Renamon said worriedly. She gazed over at Rika, the girl she loved, 
and wondered if it wasn&#39;t a selfish impulse that held her back. &#39;Here, 
we&#39;re alone together. There, I must share her again,&#39; Renamon thought 
sadly. She shook her head.

&quot;What do you want to do?&quot; Rika asked her softly. She looked over at 
the fox woman admiringly, wishing she could say to her what was in her 
heart. &#39;But what if she doesn&#39;t feel the same,&#39; Rika fretted, &#39;I would 
hurt her and myself. No, it&#39;s best to be silent.&#39;

The portal began to slowly shrink, the view of the other world growing 
smaller and smaller. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Renamon said firmly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure, 
but we don&#39;t dare loose this chance!&quot; She bounded over to Rika and 
held her in her arms before leaping through the portal!

As soon as they passed through, it shut with a puff of air behind 
them. They hit the ground, Renamon rolling them until they came to a 
stop. Rika snuggled into Renamon&#39;s arms, knowing that as long as they 
were wrapped around her, she was safe. Renamon uncurled finally, and 
gently helped Rika to her feet. They looked around in awe at the 
strange people walking by calmly, until Rika finally said &quot;Toto, I 
don&#39;t think we&#39;re in Kansas anymore.&quot;

&quot;Toto?&quot; Renamon asked Rika, before taking a moment to look around 
bemusedly. There were certainly a lot of very odd looking humans 
around here! A group of pretty young women in sailor suits were 
fighting a monster, even as the crowds ignored them. Two young girls 
walked by them in skintight bodysuits, one dressed in red, the other 
in white, and snuggling together. Not far away two young people 
wearing roses in their lapels were fighting a duel, though over what 
no one seemed quite sure.

&quot;Old joke,&quot; Rika explained. She looked around at the mob and noticed 
something really odd: they were ignoring Renamon along with all the 
other craziness going on. It was kind of cool, actually, but weird.

A younger girl and her companion watched the two stand and gawk for a 
bit before taking pity on them and walking over. She smiled at the two 
of them and asked cheerfully &quot;Hello, did you just arrive here?&quot; Behind 
her, the other girl had whipped out a video camera and was recording 
the first girl&#39;s every move.

Rika watched the two and sweatdropped. Renamon smiled tentatively, 
&quot;Yes, we just got here. My name is Renamon, and this is Rika.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Sakura,&quot; the young redhead said happily, &quot;and this is Tomoyo. 
It&#39;s very nice to meet you! Come on, we&#39;ll help you find a room,&quot; 
Sakura said.

&quot;The fact I&#39;m a giant fox doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot; Renamon asked, stunned.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen odder, even before I came to Ohtori,&quot; Sakura said gently. 
Tomoyo chimed in her agreement without stopping filming.

&quot;So we&#39;re in a place called Ohtori?&quot; Rika asked, and stood nervously 
by Renamon. She felt Renamon&#39;s hand take hers and instantly felt 
better.

Sakura saw that and smiled a bit, even as she said, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s called 
Ohtori Academy. It seems it was an odd school to start with, and now 
it&#39;s become mixed up with other worlds!&quot;

&quot;That would explain the distortion we saw,&quot; Rika said thoughtfully to 
Renamon.

&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Sakura said cheerfully, &quot;you leapt through it and here 
you are, right?&quot; At Renamon and Rika&#39;s nods, she shrugged and added &quot;I 
thought the distortion was a Clow Card until Tomoyo and I fell through 
it.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Renamon said softly. Sakura and Tomoyo led them to a 
large dorm building, a little run down looking but still nice. &quot;And 
this is?&quot;

&quot;The East Dorm,&quot; Sakura explained. &quot;A lot of the other dimensional 
visitors are staying here, until we can get back home.&quot;

The front doors opened and one girl stepped out, calling behind her 
&quot;Yolie, we&#39;re going to be late!&quot;

Another girl caught up to her and took her arm possesively. &quot;Kari, you 
know I&#39;m always worth the wait,&quot; Yolie said suggestively. Kari blushed 
brightly.

Watching them walk away, Rika said &quot;Is it me, or do those two look 
strangely familiar?&quot; Before anything more can be said, Gatomon and 
Hawkmon also speed out of the building after their partners!

&quot;Digimon?&quot; Renamon said softly. &quot;And their tamers...&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tomoyo said cheerfully. &quot;You can talk to them later, though. We 
need to get you settled first!&quot;

&quot;Definitely,&quot; Sakura agreed, and they led the wide eyed Rika and 
Renamon into the general chaos of the East Dorm! A lot of young men 
and women walked the hallways, most of them looking pretty odd. 
Strange costumes and hair colors were the rule, with only occasionally 
more traditional Japanese hair colors and uniforms.

The Light and Dark cards, snuggling in a corner, were noticed by their 
mistress, who quickly shooed them back to the Clow book. &quot;Interesting 
place,&quot; Rika said softly, noticing all the female couples. Not to 
mention the male ones, as Heero and Duo walked by arm in arm.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Renamon agreed levelly, having noticed the same thing. She 
looked at Rika and wondered &#39;Dare I tell her? I don&#39;t want to drive 
her away from me.&#39;

Sakura led them to a unclaimed room, and made a soft sound of dismay. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said kawaiily, fighting the urge to smile, &quot;it seems 
there&#39;s only singles left! Would you two mind sharing a room?&quot;

Tomoyo was smiling as well, just behind Sakura. &#39;What are those two up 
to?&#39; Rika wondered. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be a problem, right, Renamon?&quot; she 
asked softly, blushing a bit.

Renamon had a slight flush to her cheeks as well, &quot;No, I guess not.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll leave you two to get settled in,&quot; Tomoyo said, taking Sakura&#39;s 
arm and leading her away. Once they were far enough away, Tomoyo 
softly whispered to her, &quot;That was a nice thing you did, Sakura.&quot;

Sakura blushed, &quot;It&#39;s obvious they care for each other, they just 
haven&#39;t admitted it.&quot;

&quot;Do you remember when we admitted it?&quot; Tomoyo asked in a sexy whisper.

Sakura blushed brighter, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to do it again?&quot; Tomoyo asked impishly.

Back at the dorm room, Rika sat on the desk chair while Renamon tried 
lying down on the mattress. She was almost too long for it, but she 
just barely fit. &quot;It seems comfortable enough,&quot; Renamon said 
nervously.

&quot;Maybe we should see how we both will fit,&quot; Rika said softly, and 
climbed on the bed beside Renamon, The fox woman&#39;s eyes widened as 
Rika lay beside her, her smaller body seemingly to fit with Renamon&#39;s 
on the bed.

&quot;Rika, I...&quot; Renamon started, only to have Rika snuggle closer and 
completely derail her train of thought. The girl stroked her fur, up 
her arms, over her chest and up to her foxlike head. &quot;What are you 
doing?&quot; Renamon asked in a whisper.

&quot;Something I&#39;ve wanted to do a long time,&quot; Rika said softly, and 
gently kissed Renamon.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Renamon said shyly, and kissed Rika again.

&quot;I love you too, you dope!&quot; Rika laughed, and hugged Renamon fiercely. </pre>
