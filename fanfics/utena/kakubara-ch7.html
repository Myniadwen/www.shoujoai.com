&quot;Once upon a time, a noble prince gave a despairing princess a ring 
after the death of her parents.&quot;

&quot;So impressed was she by his nobility that she vowed to become a prince 
one day herself.&quot;

&quot;One day she entered a kingdom where a princess was being fought over 
by many princes.&quot;

&quot;Oh brave prince; she saved the princess, but was dragged into the 
battle herself.&quot;

&quot;She saved the princess, but at a very high cost.&quot;

&quot;In the end however, the prince and the princess were together.&quot;

&quot;Who said it was the end?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;They are together, yes; but the game isn&#39;t over. The prince still 
fights, so the story isn&#39;t over.&quot;

&quot;Oh, poor Utena-kun.&quot;

&quot;Prince, call her prince! No names, remember?&quot;

&quot;Oops.&quot;

&quot;Kashira, Kashira, Dozonai Kashira&quot;

Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Kakumei no Bara

Tournament Start; The Ladder to the Chairman&#39;s Wing

Utena sat on the balcony of her dorm room, looking out into the 
shoreline of Shirobara island. In her hand she held the completed 
Kakumei no Ken. She moonlight glinted off the perfect Katana. Next to 
her sat a box that had come in the mail form her aunt not too long ago. 
It was a velvet box that lay open. Inside the velvet lining had been a 
hilt, screws, wrapping, a sheath, and a lavishly decorated hand guard, 
shaped like a rose signet. On the paper that had been wrapped around 
the box was printed the name Tenjou Yurika and an address in Hou-ou-shi 
prefecture.

She remembered the events that lead up to her being in that particular 
spot at that particular moment. It was just after the duel with Ayani. 
As the police were taking her away, Utena and Anthy were sitting on the 
hood of some officers car. Utena had not even bothered to ask his name. 
As they sat there a strange woman approached the two of them with an 
envelope. Unlike the ones she had been getting lately, this one had 
been gold, with a different name printed on it...End of all Life. The 
woman did not have much to say.

&quot;If you want to know why Akio has started new duels, why the change in 
venue and how this girl got a duelist ring, meet me in the address 
specified tomorrow.&quot;

So now Utena sat there, staring at this new sword pondering over what 
she had learned. However, even with this new data, she still had the 
same question buzzing through her head that had been there since day 
one.

&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wakaba circled around her opponent. He was very strong and Wakaba was 
more than a little worried that he might just beat her. If that 
happened then all the effort she had placed into coming here would have 
been for nothing.

She had been coming in to school the next day, worried more about 
finding Utena than anything else. She&#39;d heard from reliable sources 
that Utena had gotten into a duel yesterday with Ayani; and anything 
with Ayani made Wakaba worry about Utena. As such, she was coming 
inside when she saw Utena siting on a bench looking sleepy. Anthy at 
next to her, hear head burrowed into Utena&#39;s neck.

&quot;Utena-sama?&quot; Wakaba asked, concerned. In front of her, Utena turned to 
face her and gave a big yawn.

&quot;Ohayo Wakaba;&quot; Utena opened her eyes and saw the look in the smaller 
girls. &quot;I guess you heard the news by now.&quot; Wakaba nodded vehemently. 
The look of concern on her face growing. She watched Utena stand and 
move in front of her. The prince spread her arms out wide and addressed 
her friend.

&quot;As you can see, I am perfectly fine. Everything is attached and 
accounted for.&quot;

&quot;Then why do you look so exhausted?&quot; Utena at least had the decency to 
blush. &quot;Ewwww!&quot;

&quot;What; it&#39;s only natural that a married couple would do that.&quot; Anthy 
murmured from her spot on the bench. She had fallen over when Utena got 
up and curled into a ball in the warm spot Utena left.

&quot;I don&#39;t need to hear that.&quot; Wakaba said, turning green. This was quite 
appropriate, since she now matched the head of hair behind her.

&quot;Tenjou.&quot;

&quot;Sayonji-senpai&quot;

Having finished addressing each other; Sayonji took Wakaba by the 
shoulders and pulled her into himself&#39; a sign of possession if ever 
Utena had seen one. Behind her Anthy picked her head up to speak.

&quot;Utena-otto; tell them about the letter.&quot;

&quot;Letter?&quot; Wakaba asked, turning to Utena.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In a darkened basement of Ohtori Academy&#39;s Hou-oh-shi campus, a 
spaceship landed and three girls stepped out. Kageshoujo A-ko thrust 
her makeshift sword into the air.

&quot;Oh brave prince, we have arrived. It is our job to help you defeat the 
evil dragon!&quot;

&quot;Dragon? You didn&#39;t say anything about any dragon. You said it was an 
evil king.&quot;

&quot;I thought it a sorcerer.&quot; C-ko added from her end. She scratched her 
head and looked around. A moment later she shrieked in horror. A-ko and 
B-ko both turned and looked where her eyes were pointed. They shrieked 
as well as they noted a rather large object behind them. It was an evil 
sorcerer king riding a dragon.

&quot;Haha, I am the evil sorcerer king riding a dragon. I have come to kill 
the prince.&quot;

&quot;Hehe, who knew I was right?&quot; A-ko laughed weakly. She and the other 
girls started backing off slowly.

&quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;What else should we do? We run!&quot;

As they ran off, the evil sorcerer king riding a dragon laughed 
manically and gave chase. Just before the lights went out, you heard 
the girls panicked voices in the background.

&quot;Kashira, Kashira, Dozonai Kashira!&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Touga sat on one of of Kami&#39;s desk, waiting for his employer to return. 
After a minute or two, she stepped into the room. Walking past him to 
her seat, she dropped a gold envelope on the desk in front of him. He 
picked it up and scanned the face of it, taking not e of the name.

&quot;Take this to the South building and wait for the others. Don&#39;t tell 
them anything yet. I have my own way of presenting things. I need that 
maintained. Do you understand?&quot;

&quot;So you want me to be your agent.&quot;

&quot;Not exactly, I just need you to make sure they come. If this is going 
to work; I need them to all be there.&quot;

&quot;If what is going to work?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you in due time Kiryuu, just worry about your mission right 
now.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Kozue rolled over and straddled Miki&#39;s chest. She could feel his body 
heat, even through her uniform. Her eyes seemed to promise love and 
violence at the same time. Miki was afraid of her at that moment, yet 
he couldn&#39;t seem to leave. He was afraid of it, but he wanted it too...
badly.

&quot;Who do you belong to?&quot; It was a simple question; most likely answered 
with &quot;no one&quot; by anyone else. However, it was the tone she used that 
told Miki that she wanted another answer; that answer was also obvious.

&quot;You;&quot; he rasped as he spoke, he couldn&#39;t get his breathing to steady. 
She rocked against his chest and her breathing started deepening. They 
were about to work themselves into a frenzy when the doorbell rang. 
With an almost feral snarl, Kozue got up and walked to the door. 
Whoever had bothered them would be getting an earful.

When she got back, she was pale and shaking. She held a gold envelope 
in her hands. The way her hands were shaking, you&#39;d think it weighed 
several pounds, not the ounce or so it actually did.

&quot;Kozue-chan, what is it?&quot;

&quot;M-Miki...&quot; All she could do was hand him the letter and sit on the bed;
she leaned against him as he opened it and read it. A hand wrapped 
around her and when he was done he kissed her on the forehead.

&quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I have to Kozue, a lot of people count on me.&quot;

&quot;I count on you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let it happened to you again. No matter what, I 
will protect you.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The great south tower looked like some great gothic church. It even 
came complete with the flying buttresses and gargoyles. It was quite 
beautiful; especially with the giant stained glass rose seal on the 
facade. Utena arrived to find her compatriots waiting for her. Their 
new uniforms were crisp and bright. Their swords were all either 
polished or being polished. Even Touga stood to the side, in his black 
uniform. Utena and Anthy walked determinately over to them.

&quot;It&#39;s time.&quot;

&quot;If we have to.&quot; Miki whispered from where he stood, he looked 
depressed.

&quot;Do we have to?&quot; Wakaba looked worried. She squirmed with all the 
nervous energy.

&quot;We have to.&quot; Sayonji answered. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot; He finished wiping his 
katana and sheathed it.

&quot;Let&#39;s go&quot; ...Juri

&quot;Indeed&quot; ... Touga

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

They entered a nondescript classroom and glanced around. It didn&#39;t look 
very different from other classrooms and that&#39;s how they knew something 
was wrong. Classrooms at Ohtori never looked ordinary.

&quot;Hello, is there anyone here?&quot; Nanami, ever the thinker, yelled blindly 
into the room, hoping to evoke a response. It worked; the lights went 
out.

&quot;Eek!&quot; There was a high pitched squeal and the sound of desks being 
knocked over resounded through the room.

&quot;Miki, please let go of my waist; and don&#39;t scream like that, it&#39;s 
undignified.&quot; Juri tried to at least loosen the boys grip

&quot;Wakaba; while I am glad that you are touching me willingly. I simply 
must tell you that I am not Sayonji.&quot; Touga was a little wary, but 
nonetheless happy. He could never turn down a hug from an attractive 
young girl.

&quot;Anthy could you please stop, this isn&#39;t the time and place for this.&quot; 
Utena swore she could hear the others sweat drop.

Then the room was illuminated as several screens started projecting. On 
each screen was footage of a duel that each of them had had with Utena. 
They moved, slipped, thrust and in the end took a back step as Utena 
performed her unbeatable thrust. All the duels ended with that same 
thrust, and just As Utena passed, the projectors shut off. The lights 
went back on, and a woman stood in the center of all of the screens.

&quot;Hello duelists.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

&quot;Akio has set up special provisions around himself to ensure his 
safety. He&#39;s made it so you just can&#39;t waltz in and challenge him to a 
duel.&quot;

Utena turned to the strange woman. &quot;So, how exactly do we get into the 
chairman&#39;s tower?&quot;

&quot;The only way is to get to the highest level in the tournament.&quot;

&quot;Level?&quot; Juri sat back in her seat and crossed her arms.

&quot;So, it&#39;s a ladder tournament; like last time.&quot; Miki was on the edge of 
his seat.

&quot;Not exactly.&quot;

&quot;Not exactly?&quot; Nanami was starting to get irritated. &quot;Then what&#39;s 
different?&quot;

The woman held out a small pocket watch. &quot;This is. It&#39;s the seal watch 
of the victor.&quot;

&quot;A seal watch does not seem to be so great a difference.&quot; Juri was 
starting to get upset herself; who was this woman to bother them of 
such trivial things.

The woman merely glared at Juri and clicked it open. The first thing 
they all noticed was the rose seal inside the watch; the next thing was 
the total lack of numbers. There were no indications of where the hours 
were.

&quot;This seal watch is more than just a nice prize for the victor; it is 
also a status chart. As you progress further up the levels, chips will 
be added. Each chip will be specially covered for each rose you cut 
off. When the watch is full you may then enter the chairman&#39;s tower. 
However; if you lose, the chips return to their owners and you start 
again. It continues like that until someone completes the watch.&quot; The 
woman turned and regarded each of them. &quot;Come with me if you want to 
see the rest of the changes.&quot; She then got up and moved towards the 
door. The duelists all stood and moved after her.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Saito and Kamari sat on the edge of the fountain playing card games. 
Tianquing was pacing in front of them, obviously growing impatient.

&quot;How can you two be so calm? We&#39;re about to start the tournament.&quot;

&quot;Correction dear Tianquing;&quot; Saito said and he rearranged his hand. 
&quot;We&#39;re about to meet the other duelists and start the qualifying round. 
The tournament does not start till all the slots are full. Do you have 
any threes?&quot;

&quot;Indeed, so please try to be patient; please. Go fish.&quot;

&quot;Damn.&quot;

Tianquing growled, his patients were running thin. If someone didn&#39;t 
show up soon he was going to go mad. Then he heard the voice from the 
far end of the building.

&quot;Ano, hello? Am I in the right place; am I yet?

Tianquing could have sworn the voice had come from a woman, it was so 
high. He might even have guessed it to belong to a boy; but when he 
caught sight of the interloper, he instead saw a man about the same age 
as he. He was all man, seeing the cut of his uniform; and he was 
carrying what had to be the biggest cross he had ever seen. Then his 
rose signet glinted off the sunlight streaming through the glass. Saito 
looked up and smiled.

&quot;Oh good, you&#39;ve arrived. Come; let me introduce you to your fellow 
student council members.&quot; He sidled up alongside the young man and led 
him to the fountain. &quot;This is Kamari, our secretary, and the vice 
president Tianquing. Everyone I&#39;d like you to meet our newest members, 
Sagara Cross.&quot;

&quot;Karasu?&quot; Kamari had trouble wrapping her mouth around the name.

&quot;Cross; I don&#39;t like shiny things so much; no I don&#39;t.&quot; He replied. He 
looked around. They seemed to be almost appraising him. He met them 
stare for stare. The one called Tianquing finally returned to his 
pacing. The girl smiled at him, friendly.

&quot;Would you like to join us in a game of cards?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be delighted; yes I would!&quot;

The other duelists, entered the greenhouse then, looking curios and 
apprehensive. Utena kept going for her sidearm, hoping that nothing 
happened, and yet strangely hoping something would. Juri seemed to 
tense up. Kami walked a bit ahead of them and greeted the student 
council. Turning back, she addressed her charges.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the old student council; I&#39;d like you to meet 
the new student council. I believe I should make the introductions.&quot; 
She tured and Touga nodded his approval. With a sweeping motion, she 
began pointing out the different duelists. &quot;On our left is vice 
president Tianquing Han, birthplace China and a most gifted swordsman 
with a Chinese sword.&quot;

&quot;Feh, the only kind worth using in this pathetic island nation.&quot;

&quot;To his right is our treasurer Hinai Kamari; born in Kyoto prefecture.&quot;

&quot;It is a pleasure, I would be honored to duel you all one day.&quot;

&quot;To her right is our newly arrived secretary, Sagara Cross.&quot;

&quot;Glad to be here, yes I am&quot;

&quot;And with no further ado; and with no lack of flourish, I present to 
you our student council president. A student and Tokyo university, 
transferred to our college program. I present Chiho Saitoh.&quot;

&quot;Greetings.&quot;

Utena leaned in to Anthy and whispered out of the side of her mouth. 
&quot;Looks like the last group of wierdos; only different colors.&quot; To which 
a nearby Juri whispered. &quot;Do try to be a little more discreet 
Tenjou-kun; some of the other wierdos could be listening.&quot; Utena jerked 
and straightened. Anthy smiled slyly. &quot;Busted.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Behind silk screen doors, three girls ran from a pursuer they had left 
long ago. Stopping in the middle, they took a minute to catch their 
breath.

&quot;Kashira Kashira Dozonai Kashira...do you think we lost him?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Suddenly, Akio walked onscreen and stood there, relaxed as always.

&quot;Excuse me ladies, can I be of service.&quot;

&quot;Eh... no thank you mister chairman. Erm, what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Well, I just came to offer you ladies a job.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After a few minute of getting to know one another, Kami, moved over to 
the pillar Utena had seen the other day and pressed a ring in. As 
before, the gate opened up from the fountain and burst open. On her 
request the duelists were ushered inside and the gondola began rising 
up to the arena.

&quot;this gondola is not the oen we will be using for the tournament. It is 
smoother, but it lacks the speed to get you to the arena. So, by the 
start of the normal tournament, it will be fully prepared.

When they got to the top of the elevator, they were all at a peak of 
curiosity to see what had brought them up there. As far as they could 
tell, there was nothing remarkable in the arena. They all dismounted 
the elevator and started wandering. Amidst the wandering Kami stood in 
a corner and clapped her hands. Suddenly, hundred of screen, large and 
small opened up all over the arena. There were so many that many of 
them overlapped others. All of them were of Akio, sitting in his 
office, staring at them.

&quot;Hello duelists.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Preview of Next Episode:

Akio: Hello duelsits&#39;; I bet you&#39;re just itching to find out what 
happens next.

Utena: Damn right, you&#39;d better talk.

Akio: My my; such impatience. Well relax, we&#39;re almost done explaining.

Anthy: Hello onii-sama^^

Akio: Hello Anthy^^. As I was saying, all I need to explain is a small 
point and then we can begin.

Utena: Okay...hey, who&#39;s the big guy on the screen and how come Wakaba&#39;s
shaking like that? What? She&#39;s gotta fight him!

Wakaba: Whaaaaa! I don&#39;t wanna die!

Sayonji: Have courage Wakaba; you will persevere.

Utena: Hey! What are you two doing on my preview section? Get outta 
here!

Anthy^^: Next time on Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Kakumei no Bara; An 
ordinary star can shine; Wakaba&#39;s rise to the top! Don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s 
the Absolute Destiny Apocalypse.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Omake Omake Omake!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When they got to the top of the elevator, they were all at a peak of 
curiosity to see what had brought them up there. As far as they could 
tell, there was nothing remarkable in the arena. They all dismounted 
the elevator and started wandering. Amidst the wandering Kami stood in 
a corner and clapped her hands. Suddenly hundreds of Vid-Windows 
opened. There were so many that many of them overlapped others. In each 
of them was Megabyte, sitting and staring out into the world.

Megabyte: &quot;Hello Bob.&quot;

All: &quot;...&quot;

Megabyte: &quot;Erm, Bob? Is this the right address?&quot;

Anthy: &quot;Um, no. Sorry ^^O&quot;

Wakaba: &quot;Who&#39;s Bob?&quot;

Megabyte: &quot;Sorry to bother you, I&#39;ll just be hanging up now. Good day 
to you&quot;

Megabyte&#39;s windows close, leaving all present, stupefied. Kami merely 
held her hands together in the same position she had them in when she 
clapped.

Kami: &quot;I really must get a more distinct address; that&#39;s the third time 
this has happened so far.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Well. I made my story a little less like total crap. So now, I can move 
ahead. Sorry for the shortness of this chapter. Also any suggestions 
for duelist types and other things please email me at DiCyfer@aol.com 
or use aim if you see my name. Here&#39;s an interesting contest for my 
fans. Please write an opening for this series using the song Hikari 
from Utada Hikaru alias the kingdom hearts theme. Remember, nothing too 
graphic or out of character. Also feel free to use semi-reversals of 
parts of the first opening. If you want to put spoilers in it to tease 
fans and I&#39;ll tell you some things that may actually be useful for an 
opening. Well, that&#39;s it for now, bye bye.</pre>
