Staring into those faintly glowing robin&#39;s egg eyes, Anthy was too 
shocked to speak for a moment. The Guardian was blushing ever so faintly 
in a look that was unmistakenably shame. A woman? This was the proud 
noble figure that had taken on a battalion of men single handedly, and 
crossed swords with one of the most feared generals in the kingdom? 

How remarkable...

Anthy finally stood back, allowing the Guardian to climb wearily to its 
feet, shoulders ever so slightly hunched.

&quot;I-I didn&#39;t realize...but why would you...&quot; She was lost. The female 
knight gave a half shrug as she turned to face the dusky princess fully. 
&quot;I humbly ask your forgiveness.&quot; Rose colored tendrils rolled over the 
breastplate as she bent to one knee in front of her new Charge. &quot;I can 
only give my utmost apology for deceiving you, as I am certain you are 
most disappointed in my...gender...&quot;

That was what was bothering her knight? The fact that Anthy might be 
upset? She suddenly chuckled, a rich rolling sound that startled the 
blue eyed girl. Hastening to calm herself and explain, Anthy crounched 
down to the armored woman&#39;s level and spoke.

&quot;Oh no...that does not matter. I was merely surprised that you hid it. 
It is very impressive that a woman could perform the feats you have. 
No...&quot; She held out the helm as a peace offering. &quot;I should beg your 
forgiveness. I should not have acted so boldly.&quot; They were both being so 
very careful with each other, that Anthy felt as if they were walking on 
glass.

The knight flushed slightly at the praise and took the draconic helm 
from her hands as she stood. She offered Anthy a hand. &quot;Please, think 
nothing of it...I was merely concerned that...my not being male...would 
detract from my threat as your Guardian. That it would somehow lower 
your standing. I...intend to conceal it for a time when we meet with 
your brother, the king, as well.&quot;

Anthy gave a smooth nod of acceptance. &quot;Of course, you would know best.&quot; 
The knight gave a small smile, and Anthy felt its warmth knot inside her 
belly. The Guardian then placed the helm on the table, and took a seat 
on the chair, across from where Anthy now found herself seated on the 
bed. The tension was gone now, as if a weight had been lifted from each 
of them. But curiosity made the emerald eyed witch cock her head 
slightly as she took in her knight&#39;s appearance. She was definitely 
human seeming...but the way she had run earlier...moving easily beside a 
galloping horse...catching swords in her hands as if they were nothing. 
She didn&#39;t feel otherworldly. Anthy let her inner senses coil out 
hesitantly to poke gently at the other&#39;s aura. No...she wasn&#39;t some sort 
of demon or spirit. She felt that alien side to her form...something 
that made her think of the steel in swords, and the iron in wagon 
bearings...But the teachings said...what was she?

The violet haired woman&#39;s mind ran back to the conversation from the 
night before:

(&quot;Like a...doll...or maybe some sort of construct. I&#39;ve never seen metal 
move like you do.&quot; 

&quot;I am...a result of bio engineering and cybernetics. Unlike most robots, 
I am what is called a cyborg, human and technology melded into one being 
with the human core and brain functions still left intact.&quot; )

So did that mean she was once human, like Anthy? Although perhaps Anthy 
herself wasn&#39;t the best of examples...not to the others that lived 
within the realm. Still, a human core...inside of a living suit of 
armor. The thought was chilling. That the ancient peoples were able to 
work such magiks...inconceivable! Anthy couldn&#39;t imagine creating 
something like that, even with the dark teachings she had studied in the 
library&#39;s dusty alcoves. She realized the knight was looking at her 
curiously, and she flushed at having been caught staring. Without that 
fearsome helmet to obscure her features, the woman across from her was 
so very...well, human. Did that mean she had a name? Anthy decided to 
ask.

&quot;Ah...Lady Guardian...perhaps...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I was curious if there was another name I might call you? I feel it 
does you no honor to simply call you &#39;Guardian&#39; or &#39;Knight&#39;. Have you a 
name with which you would prefer to be addressed?&quot; The knight was 
surprised, and she hid it only barely. But Anthy caught the flicker of 
movement around the creases of her eyes. Was the question...offensive?

The knight gave a small self-mocking smirk. &quot;Ah...my name. It has been 
sometime since I was called by my designation.&quot;

&quot;Designation?&quot;

The knight gave a small rueful nod. &quot;Yes...back before I entered the 
Guardian Program as a cadet, the people in my sector were numbered and 
labeled by our designation codes. They were usually based on what sector 
we lived in, what generation of offspring we were, and which facility we 
were sired at. Things were...very different from the way they are here 
now...&quot; The Guardian sighed ever so slightly, gazing out the window. Her 
voice took on the echo of centuries, as she recalled what she could of 
her past. Anthy listened in rapt attention.

&quot;I was born...in what was known as the U3X251 sector, a military 
community. 10th in my line of offspring for that quota. The Arima 
Facility was were my egg was fertilized. To prevent contamination, you 
see. I was also given the honor of having a last name, a rarity at that 
time. Only those who were sired from an officer of outstanding rank and 
prestige was allowed to carry that person&#39;s name as a last name. So my 
name is...Utena...Tenjou.&quot;

Anthy hadn&#39;t been able to follow all of it...but from the cold bland way 
the Lady Tenjou described her situation...it sounded bleak. She didn&#39;t 
seem to have any real connection to the one who &#39;sired&#39; her. So did she 
not grow up with parents? Anthy looked on sadly as Utena continued 
staring out the window. She seemed so strong, so untouchable. Like 
polished marble in the sun. But underlying that rigid nobility...was 
someone who was like her once. The dark skinned woman opened her mouth 
to ask another question, but haltingly stopped as the knight stood and 
moved over to one of the unused cloths. Swiping it over her armor, and 
checking that her sword was loose in its sheath, the knight moved over 
to the door.

&quot;The lad, Tsuwabuki, returns.&quot;

And sure enough within a minute&#39;s time, they could hear his familiar 
haste upon the stairs. He knocked, and a breath later he came into the 
room, weighed down my an enormous box. &quot;Ah my lady...I...I-I&#39;ve got your 
commission!&quot; He beamed with pride, trying to talk his way around a nest 
of pins he held tight in his mouth. Utena moved from the door to steady 
the box he nearly dropped, and plucked it from his tired arms to set it 
carefully on the bed next to Anthy. Head bent down as he went about 
brushing off his tailor&#39;s vest, Tsuwabuki looked up towards the Princess 
and gave a nod of approval towards the box.

&quot;We took a lot of time choosing the proper color and texture to match 
well with your lovely dark skin and eyes...and I think you&#39;ll look 
absolutely ravishing! Please m&#39;lady, shall we try it on for the final 
fitting?&quot; He turned back to look at the knight who had aided him, only 
really noticing her for the first time. Was it his imagination or had he 
caught a glimpse of the knight&#39;s helmet on the table... He turned to 
look, but the helm was gone, and the fully armored knight was standing 
as it always was securely by the door. 

That&#39;s funny..., He thought to himself. I thought I had seen a glimpse 
of his face as I was coming in...I must have been mistaken...

His curiosity burned slightly as to what the strong gentleman&#39;s features 
would look like. Surely a rigid jawline, high cheek bones...broad 
shoulders under the shoulder spikes...perhaps he could get an extra set 
of commissions if he were to-Shaking his head firmly to concentrate on 
the work at hand, Tsuwabuki blushed sheepishly. &quot;Now then let&#39;s work to 
make you look perfect, noble lady!&quot; Anthy blushed with pleasure at the 
young boy&#39;s sweet nature. &quot;Please, call me Anthy.&quot; She replied with a 
small chuckle as she lifted the lid of the box up. Her breath halted in 
her throat. It was...stunning...

Unseen by the boy who had all his attention on his model before him, 
Utena Tenjou swiped the rest of her long trailing hair back up 
underneath the back of her helm, so that she was completely conceal once 
more. Her enhanced blue eyes caught on the Princess&#39; own as she stood 
straight again, by neither said anything. Anthy turned her attention to 
the little boy moving to look at her from all angles, while Utena turned 
her attention to the streets below their windows and the sounds of the 
customers down below.

Anthy, at Tsuawabuki&#39;s fidgeting request, lifted forth sweeping folds of 
wine red from the white protective cloth, and held it up to the light. 
Shimmering crushed velvet belled out slightly, leaving a small train. 
The arms had been sectioned off and were connected through intricate 
cording the same color as the dress. And peeking from underneath the 
cording, and up through the square embroidered collar, was a ruffled 
cream chemise. The gold edging and embroidered phoenix on the simple 
tooled leather belt that held it firmly to one&#39;s waist brought out the 
delicate designs on the full billowing sleeves. Over all, simply holding 
it against her to look across into the small mirror on the table, she 
was speechless. It was a work of art...surely this couldn&#39;t be for her.

A gentle hand brought the dress closer to her chin. &quot;Please try it on my 
lady. I am certain you&#39;ll look divine.&quot; She gazed into Tsuwabuki&#39;s eyes 
and for a moment felt on the verge of tears. With a firm hand, the 
knight pulled him aside so she could collect herself. &quot;Yes, let us allow 
the lady some privacy while she changes into her things. Surely with all 
those measurements, not too many alterations are needed.&quot;

The blonde haired boy allowed himself to be cheerfully steered out. &quot;Oh 
now hey, Sir Knight! I just want to make sure everything is checked to 
the letter! I won&#39;t allow the other tailors in the guild hall to make 
sport of me!&quot; She listened to his bright laughter bubble up the stairs 
as she carefully undid the many buttons and fastenings on the gown 
itself. It took some trial and error, the fashion for women these days 
seemed to always grow more and more complicated. But at last she was 
swathed in her new attire, and was slipping on the velveteen slippers 
that accompanied it. A cautious rap on her door alerted her to the 
waiting pair.

&quot;Yes, please come in now...ah, gentlemen.&quot;

She blushed self consciously as the two entered and suddenly stood stock 
still. Worriedly she looked down at herself. Had she forgotten a button 
or two? Was she exposed in some way? Those looks of shock she kept 
receiving, it made her feel strange.

&quot;A-ah...wow...um...you look...&quot; The boy stammered with a bright blush to 
his cheeks.

&quot;...Magnificent...&quot; came the solemn reply from within the armor behind 
him. Anthy gave a warm smile of thanks to the both of them. &quot; Thank you 
so much...this dress is...really too much for someone like me.&quot; 
Tsuwabuki gave a hasty shake of his head as he practically bounced over, 
pins between his fingers, and a length of thread in his mouth. As he 
worked quickly and carefully, his eyes completely trained on the 
delicate workings, he answered the dusky beauty before him seriously.

&quot;Nay my Lady Anthy, I must disagree. As a tailor, it is my duty to 
create beautiful things for people to wear. But truly, it isn&#39;t the 
clothes that make the person, it is the person wearing them, that brings 
such elegant art to the gowns themselves. It was my honor, to bedeck you 
in cloth that was befitting your graces. You shall be the envy of any 
ball you attend!&quot; He smiled up at her, his youthful face seeming wise 
beyond it&#39;s few years.

&quot;Will you be going up to the castle then, to meet with the court and our 
most high King?&quot;

Anthy hesitated, looking over to the knight, who stepped forward to 
answer for her. &quot;I will be presenting the Lady Anthy as a noble to be 
formally recognized. Her status as &#39;Princess&#39; will be established, as 
will my awakening as her Guardian. You have my thanks, Master Tsuwabuki. 
For you services.&quot;

The boy cut the thread with a his teeth, and leaned back with an expert 
eye. &quot;Hmm, yes....I do believe that will do it! Okay then, now shall we 
have a look at YOU sir Knight?&quot; The boy&#39;s smile became sly as the knight 
took a slight step back.

&quot;...Me?&quot;

Clapping his hands together, practically bouncing on his heels in 
excitement, the boy tailor gave a firm nod. &quot;Why indeed! Surely you will 
want to match the fair Lady as her Knight and companion! I have quite a 
few handsome doublets that will look magnificent, and match the Lady 
entirely! Or perhaps you would like a simple chiton, or -&quot;

He was cut off by a hastily raised hand. &quot;Erm, my thanks. However I 
intend to remain in full armor for our arrival at the castle.&quot;

Crestfallen, the blonde boy scratched at his short feathery locks as he 
tried again. &quot;Well surely you will at least where a matching cloak then? 
Your armor is indeed impressive, but I really think it could be improved 
to act as an lovely accessory to the noble lady&#39;s gown!&quot;

Sounding slightly bewildered the knight gave a half-hearted attempt, 
&quot;But really, all attention should be focused on her and-&quot;

&quot;Nonsense! The lady will tell you herself, a knight of your standing 
would look elegant and masculine with a fine satin-lined cloak! A red to 
match her dress, and with a slight black trim to accentuate the silver 
on your armor. Yes! A matching set, sure to turn the heads of all who 
gaze upon you!&quot;

&quot;A-ah, well...erm...&quot;

&quot;What say you, Princess Anthy?&quot; Blue eyes twinkled as he remembered to 
address her by her title. &quot;Surely you&#39;ll convince your knight to take 
his proper place at your side. All defenders of nobility should wear 
their patron noble&#39;s colors!&quot;

Anthy gave small giggle, as she played along. &quot;Well now...I certainly 
wouldn&#39;t be so bold as to tell the ancient defender of these lands what 
to do...even though it would give me great confidence and pride to gaze 
upon such an inspiring cloak.&quot;

The knight&#39;s shoulders slumped in defeat. &quot;Ah...very well, should my 
Lady desire it...&quot;

&quot;Splendid! I have just the thing! Come come, let&#39;s get you outfitted 
down at the hall. We&#39;ll see about some accessories for the Princess as 
well....maybe a nice choker of creamy lace...some ornaments for her 
hair...ah come come Sir Knight! Your steps seem far too weighted. Let us 
be quickly away, I wish to display the both of you before you leave!&quot;

Being tugged along by the surprisingly strong young man, the knight 
grabbed ahold of the doorframe and looked over her shoulder. Lifting her 
metal slitted visor enough to show off her sky colored eyes, she spoke 
low &quot;I will order us some sort of transport to get us to the castle. 
Please remain in your room until my return. Do not let anyone in except 
for myself and Tsuwabuki. I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve caused something of a stir 
within the town...&quot;

Before she could say anymore, Tsuwabuki firmly yanked the female knight 
out of the doorway, which Anthy shut gently behind them. A stir in the 
town? That did not bode well...

She turned a brass key in the lock and placed it on the table as she 
took a seat on the bed. In wonder, the emerald eyed woman gazed at her 
reflection in the mirror adjacent to her. It was as if...a stranger 
stared back at her. She didn&#39;t recognize the healthy glow to her skin, 
brought out by the richness of the fabric. Her cinnamon colored 
complexion seem fuller, more vibrant next to the velvet, and her 
cascading violet mane of hair made for a pleasing contrast. A far cry 
indeed from the filthy slave that had been roughing it in the woods not 
only a day before. It was as if, in the short time she had been rescued 
by her Guardian...she had been rescued in other ways as well...

Musing to herself, she rose to go and look out the window, and nearly 
darted back inside as a small cry rose up from the streets below. There 
were peddlers and merchants, with their faded colored stalls gazing up 
at her attentively. She could make out the sounds of hawkers crying up 
at her, to only please come down and see their wares! &quot;A vision in the 
window&quot;, some said. An exotic maiden from far away lands! No one 
recognized her as the drab wretch from before. And none knew her as the 
king&#39;s only sister... Her expression closed down again, and she leaned 
back into the window. The streets were certainly more busy than normal. 
And she didn&#39;t recall that many carts being set up outside the Errant 
Rose earlier...had news of her &#39;arrival&#39; already spread? The idea didn&#39;t 
sit well with her. And only led her to think of what her brother would 
say once she returned to the castle. Feeling suddenly ill, she moved to 
recline on the bed, and close her eyes.

A commotion from the streets below startled her from her reverie. Coming 
quickly to her feet, she flew to the open window sill and gasped at the 
sight below her. The knight known as Utena was currently locking swords 
with a squad of black armored knights, that she recognized from the 
mountain. Lord Saionji&#39;s men. Did that mean he was here as well! Filled 
with a panic she had nearly forgotten, she took several hasty steps back 
from the window, and gave a mild screech as a crossbow bolt exploded 
into the wood frame. Hands over her ears, she crounched down behind the 
protective safety of the bed&#39;s frame, terrified. A loud cry roared from 
below, and she heard a crowd began to shout excitedly. The sounds of 
ringing steel clanged and reverberated off of the stone and thatch 
buildings in the far too narrow alleys of the district. Onlookers below 
watched from doorways and behind tents and stalls as several men were 
flung into a cart of produce, splintering it on impact. The white 
knight, single-handedly charged into the fray, as the men of Kyoichi, 
with their single green striped crests, tried to surround their 
adversary. Booting one under the chin, and tossing another one into a 
wall, the white knight was a blur of violence. The holy sword was loosed 
once more, and it was quickly slicked in red. Cries of torment started 
up, as men fell to their heavy wounds, but still the knight did not 
stop. A blur of steel, and vicious snarl sent another man to the dirt 
with a hilt to his head. His helm split and fell off. Hearing the sounds 
of movement behind her, the knight saw a pair of knights trying to drag 
one of their comrades to safety, and brought her rapier into a whistling 
arc for the killing blow-

&quot;NO!&quot;

--and stopped, inches away from a pair of terror widened eyes. Visibly 
shaking, the two knights remained where they were, for fear of 
insighting the white demon to more violence. But a woman&#39;s voice from 
the window had the knight&#39;s full attention.

&quot;Do not kill them if they yield! The rules of chivalry must remain 
unbroken! They are the king&#39;s men still!&quot; Several men, groaning in pain, 
began sitting up from their sprawled positions along the ground. One of 
them, a burly man with his arm hanging limply at his side, yanked his 
head from between the wagon spokes it had gotten stuck in, and fell to 
his knees. Clumsily, he pulled his sword from his sheath, and tossed it 
at his captor&#39;s feet.

&quot;Y-yield! We yield...lay down yer arms!&quot; Around them, the rest began 
doing the same, coming to drop on both knees, heads bent in defeat. The 
crowd was deathly silent, captivated by the melodrama playing out before 
them. What would the fearsome white knight do next? Whispers began to 
break out. The Guardian herself, still hunched over in the same position 
had been ready to kill in, slowly creaked and clanked into a full 
standing position, towering over her fallen enemies. For a moment lost 
in time, the men gazed up into the glowing blue lights that surely came 
from hell itself. But all breathed a collective sigh of relief as the 
knight wiped off the gleaming sword, and sheathed it once more.

&quot;As my Princess decrees...&quot; Came the low growl from behind that 
faceplate. But then the knight grabbed the collar of the man who had 
first dropped arms and addressed him directly.

&quot;Who are you!&quot;

&quot;L-Lahrd Saionji&#39;s 17th bat-&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask for whom you served, I asked who are you! Give me your 
name.&quot;

&quot;Balus, m&#39;lord. Captain Balus.&quot;

&quot;Well then Captain, you have lost. Thus your life and honor are forfeit, 
am I correct?&quot;

&quot;...Yes my lahrd. What...what would yeh have of me and me men?&quot;

&quot;First I want your wounded sent back to your barracks to be cared for. 
Those of you able to stand and wield a sword shall accompany the 
Princess and I to the castle as our temporary honor guard.&quot;

&quot;S-sir!&quot;

&quot;Is there some sort of problem?&quot;

&quot;O-of course not m&#39;lahrd. It shall be done without fail!&quot; Balus barked a 
few orders, and soldiers began picking up their comrades to begin moving 
out to their military encampments, but a gesture from the White Knight 
halted them.

&quot;Allow me to make one thing clear...any who dare attempt to attack my 
charge again, or show such cowardice as to plot an ambush...shall answer 
to me. And you will not like the encounter. Let there be no doubt in 
your mind.&quot; The voice behind that purely gleaming helm sounded like the 
growl of the dread Cerberus itself. A tone that made all who heard it 
shiver in fear. Anthy herself, looking slightly disheveled from the 
window she had reclaimed, felt herself go pale. She had never heard such 
obvious violence in her Guardian&#39;s tone before...like a sleeping dragon 
awoken.

The men gave a crisp salute, clapping fists to their hearts, and 
hastened to obey the knight&#39;s instructions. The captain, pulled to his 
feet by the strength into those silver gauntlets, removed his plumed 
helm, and gave a bow.

&quot;Forgive our transgressions, me most honorable lahrd. We will not fail 
in our duty to yeh.&quot;

&quot;No...I do not think you will.&quot; Sounding slightly tired, the Knight 
gazed out at the crowd they had drawn, and soon people began rushing to 
go about their business again. Balus, selecting a team of ten fairly 
unharmed soldiers, went about the process of clearing off the streets 
and making way for the tall sweeping Knight. Utena, still concealed 
behind her impressive armor, turned to the slightly taller bearded 
captain. &quot;Tell me captain, what means of transport have we to the 
castle.&quot;

The captain looked at her curiously. &quot;Transport? Well now...I don&#39; 
suppose you&#39;d want to be walking...so either cart or horse back would be 
yer option. Unless of course yeh have coin to be a payin&#39; for the luxury 
of a carriage.&quot;

&quot;Then you have no...cars? Trains? No taxi&#39;s or anything of that sort?&quot; 
But a look of pure bafflement gave the rose haired knight her answer.

&quot;Erm, beggin&#39; yer pardon...but I can&#39;t say I be certain what those 
things are...yeh must have traveled far then. But, why should yeh be 
needin&#39; the likes of us to be escourtin&#39; yeh to the castle?&quot; He hastened 
to show his sincerity, &quot;Ah, not that I be complain&#39;n! I owe my life to 
yeh...not many knights follow with the old ways of chivalry, despite the 
flourish and pomp they spout off in front of the maidens. You given us a 
chance to...work off the debt we be owin&#39; yeh...it makes an impression 
on the men. And &#39;though I can&#39;t promise anythin&#39; once the Lahrd Saionji 
reclaims us. He is our noble after all...but...we&#39;d be honored to act as 
yer guard into the castle halls. Princess say yeh?&quot;

Utena led them to the steps of the Errant Rose. &quot;Yes, the Princess 
Anthy. Sister to the king.&quot; The man&#39;s flinch did not go unnoticed as she 
smoothly continued, &quot; And I will be personally announcing her to the 
court, as well as her newly reclaimed rank among the nobility. So it 
only serves to better us both, if you regain honor as our escort, and 
she is shown the respect she deserves as my personal Charge. By serving 
us with open cooperation, we have shown those around us that we are 
honorable enough to move past...minor misunderstandings. Yes?&quot;

The man balked, his ruddy beard bouncing as he stood lost for words. 
Giving up, with a sigh and a shake of his head, he ran fingers over his 
bald head. &quot;I don&#39; know what yeh are...but yer about to turn the whole 
kingdom on it&#39;s ear, yeh know that?&quot;

The Guardian&#39;s low voice came out with a ring of amusement. &quot;I 
know...but do not be concerned. It is what I intend.&quot; She caught him 
gazing at the rose sigil on her breastplate thoughtfully, something akin 
to cunning flitting in his hooded eyes. With a small smirk he gave a 
firm nod of acceptance. &quot;Yes...mayhap you do...&quot;

Anthy was just about to go mad from the worry, when a firm rap came at 
her door. Without pausing to question who it was, she flung it open wide 
and was greeted by the shining form of her Guardian and the much smaller 
Tsuwabuki. Surprisingly, the boy didn&#39;t look any worse for the wear. 
Concerned about her knight, she asked&quot;Ah! L-lord Tenjou, are you...?&quot; 
She moved to touch the knight&#39;s arm gently, and was rewarded with a 
small pat on her hand. &quot;I am fine my Lady. Please forgive me for 
my...poor conduct in the streets. I...lost my temper.&quot; Anthy blinked in 
shock. She had...lost her temper? That wasn&#39;t her truly in a rage? 
Well...at least she could be comforted by the thought her protector was 
certainly capable. Then realizing there was something different about 
her knight, she took a step back to see.

A rick wine red cape, clasped at the neck and draping fluidly over one 
shoulder and arm swirled about the knight, falling to just above 
midcalf. There was a new red sheath on the swordswoman&#39;s hip,. Matching 
the cape and Anthy&#39;s dress. They were only small touches, but seemed to 
evoke a complete change in appearance. Glancing at the mirror, where 
both were framed, they really did look splendid. Their matching apparel 
left no room for doubt who it was that the Guardian had chosen to serve. 
Although, perhaps &#39;serve&#39; wasn&#39;t the right word...

&quot;My lady, I have a carriage awaiting us below. Shall we leave for the 
castle as soon as Tsuwabuki is finished?&quot; The boy in question was 
fastening a choker about her slender neck with soft deft hands, and had 
placed small gold things in her hair while she hadn&#39;t been paying 
attention. &quot;It is growing to be late midday...I should like to have 
dinner indoors perhaps.&quot; The visor was lifted, and Anthy smiled at the 
slight crinkle around those blue eyes. The other woman&#39;s confidence 
seemed to flow into herself, allowing her to recall the lessons she had 
taken as a child. Letting her remember how the women in court acted.

&quot;Yes, SIR Tenjou. Let us be off.&quot; Her tone held the confident ring that 
only the aristocrat could manage. The Knight gave a nod of approval as 
she held out one arm, which Anthy took. Tsuwabuki gave a bow, and 
hurriedly went out before them, calling for the press of people below to 
make way. He himself disappeared into the reform gathering of people, 
motioning to his fellows in the Tailors Guild.

Together, Anthy and Utena descended the stairs and walked out the short 
path to where an elegant black coach awaited them. In lines of five on 
either side, their newly acquired Honor Guard snapped to attention as 
they passed. Bowing slightly to offer her steel gloved hand to the newly 
born Princess, the White Knight, as she was now being called, gave a 
small wave to a blond haired boy pointing to them excitedly from his 
place in the crowd. A group of thoughtful looking men and women murmured

Utena stepped into the coach after the dark skinned woman, and Captain 
Balus moved to shut the door securely. A snap of the reins and the 
wooden contraption began rolling smoothly, led by a team of four horses.

&#39;Anthy&#39;, Sir Utena?&quot; She was rewarded by a low chuckling behind that 
expressionless helm, as the two of the sat back to enjoy the ride. The 
ride to what lay before them...
