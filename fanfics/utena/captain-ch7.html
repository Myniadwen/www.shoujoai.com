<a href="../utena/captain-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Ruka closed the door to his suite and then carefully walked thought 
the rooms, sword ready, before he let himself relax. He sat in a 
comfortable chair, poured himself a drink, then with slightly shaking 
hands picked up a small picture nearby.

The two stood there in the mage created image, guard uniforms crisp 
and broad smiles on their faces. There is friendship there, comrades 
in arms, and on one of their faces, love as well. &quot;Juri,&quot; Ruka sighed 
to himself sadly, and gently put the picture of the two of them back 
down.

He heard something and stiffened, then he relaxed a bit as he said 
softly, &quot;Lord Akio, it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it,&quot; the shadowy figure said, his amusement obvious 
in his voice. &quot;Do you still care for her, then? Even after she 
rejected you publicly?&quot; Akio asked, smiling at him cruelly.

&quot;Did you have business to discuss? I don&#39;t have time for games,&quot; Ruka 
asked him curtly, his voice a dangerous whisper.

Akio&#39;s eyes glittered with his anger. &#39;When I have no more need of 
you,&#39; he vowed to himself silently, &#39;you will suffer for that.&#39; 
Reigning in his temper, &quot;This Tenjou Utena is a more serious problem 
than I anticipated. I want her dead, before she creates any more 
complications.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t be easy,&quot; Ruka mused, and looked up at Akio slyly as he 
added, &quot;nor will it be cheap.&quot; A thump, and a heavy bag of gold landed 
on the table right beside him. He smiled, &quot;A pleasure doing business 
with you.&quot;

&quot;Do not fail me,&quot; Akio said coldly, and then slowly and silently faded 
away.

Utena sighed as she explained the morning&#39;s events to a sympathetic 
Juri. &quot;And then she just left without saying a word,&quot; Utena concluded.

Juri took a drink of her coffee thoughtfully before saying, 
&quot;Apologize.&quot;

Utena blinked at her in confusion. &quot;Apologize for what?&quot; she asked, 
sounding more than a bit exasperated. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything!&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t really matter,&quot; Juri explained to her patiently, sounding 
almost fatherly as she said, &quot;it could just be that she misunderstood 
something you said. Whatever it was, you need to apologize to the 
lady.&quot;

Utena sighed wearily, &quot;I&#39;ll never understand women.&quot; She took a drink 
of her coffee, and her manner seemed to change, becoming more 
business-like as she asked, &quot;What&#39;s the progress on the Kiryuu 
investigation?&quot;

Juri sat up straighter as she answered, &quot;It gets murkier and murkier, 
Utena. I think he&#39;s just the tip of the sword.&quot; Utena just nodded a 
bit, not looking terribly surprised by that piece of news. &quot;You 
already knew,&quot; Juri said softly.

Utena put her cup down. &quot;The mess the old Captain left us made me 
wonder,&quot; she admitted quietly. &quot;You don&#39;t get that level of corruption 
without having someone close to the top, and Kiryuu was his second,&quot; 
she sighed. She looked across at Juri, &quot;Was Kiryuu in charge, you 
think?&quot;

Juri shook her head no. &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d like people to think that, 
though,&quot; she said with a small smile. More seriously, &quot;He wasn&#39;t lying 
about his money problems. Someone else must have been sponsoring him.&quot;

&quot;Akio, probably,&quot; Utena sighed. She frowned, &quot;But check among the 
other nobles for anyone else who would gain from Anthy&#39;s removal.&quot;

&quot;So you think they&#39;ll be another attempt on her life?&quot; Juri asked. 
&quot;Why are we sitting around for?&quot;

Utena shook her head, &quot;Nothing that obvious. If she dies under 
suspicious circumstances, whoever arranged all this would know there 
would be an investigation. They&#39;ll be more subtle next time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why you ordered food tasters,&quot; Juri said with a slow nod. A 
slight flush appeared on her cheeks, &quot;And asked Lady Shiori here.&quot;

&quot;Of which you&#39;re quite happy, I see,&quot; Utena said in more relaxed 
tones. &quot;How serious are you about her?&quot; Utena asked with a smile.

Juri blushed harder, &quot;She interests me, I must admit.&quot; She looked over 
at Utena thoughtfully, &quot;I noticed that there was something going on 
between you. Were you once lovers?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Utena said, shaking her head, &quot;though she did try. I was a bit 
besotted with someone else at the time, so...&quot; she shrugged comically.

Juri nodded thoughtfully. &quot;So you wouldn&#39;t object if I became involved 
with her?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;As long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with you work,&quot; Utena shrugged in 
reply. She looked up at Juri and added softly, &quot;Shiori&#39;s not the most 
monogamous person I know, so be careful, please.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri said, and got up from the table. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later,&quot; 
she said with a wave, and was off to work.



Ruka dug through the court library&#39;s books of law with a fierce frown 
on his face. He carelessly cast the precious books aside as he 
searched, looking for the one that he dimly remembered reading. He 
pulled out a dusty tomb and smiled to himself suddenly. He flipped a 
few pages and smiled happily as he found what he wanted.

&quot;I was right,&quot; he whispered, a small smile on his face. He tucked the 
book under his arm and left briskly for the court.

He entered the hall quietly, watching Anthy sitting on her throne, 
taking petitions from the public. She heard disputes and requests, 
giving each the time and patience required to deal with them.

Utena stood at her side, occasionally receiving a warm glance from the 
young Princess. Obviously, the stories of a fight between the two of 
them were untrue, or at least greatly exaggerated. Utena stood tall, 
her eyes watchful, and he smiled, knowing that the young woman could 
not expect the attack that was coming.

He waited for the right moment to step forward, flinging his cloak 
aside as he stepped out in front of the throne. Utena grasped her 
sword reflexedly, and Ruka smiled broadly, &quot;By the laws of the High 
Kings, and the oaths of her forefathers, I challenge Princess Anthy&#39;s 
worthiness for the throne.&quot;

Utena looked about in honest confusion, and Ruka smiled as he heard 
her ask, &quot;What&#39;s he talking about?&quot;

Miki stepped up to her side, &quot;By the old laws, a noble can call for a 
trial by combat to test the worthiness of a Royal.&quot; He sighed, &quot;And 
Ruka is of noble blood.&quot;

Utena straightened, and said the words that Ruka so wanted to hear, 
&quot;Then in her name, I&#39;ll accept the challenge.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; a aristocratic voice that Ruka recognized instantly said, &quot;I 
will.&quot; Arisugawa Juri stepped out of the crowd to stand before Anthy. 
She knelt, continuing, &quot;By your leave, Princess, let me answer this 
unworthy one&#39;s challenge.&quot;

Anthy seemed torn, but she saw something in Juri&#39;s eyes, a fire 
burning, and responded quietly, &quot;Juri will fight for me.&quot;

Ruka clenched his jaw, fighting back his anger. He didn&#39;t want Juri, 
he wanted Utena! He looked into Juri&#39;s eyes, even as the area in front 
of the throne was cleared for the trial by combat.

Juri looked him in the eye before quietly saying, &quot;You can still 
withdrawal the challenge, you know.&quot;

Ruka smiled slightly, &quot;You know I can&#39;t. Will you step aside, and let 
me face Utena here, instead?&quot;

Juri smiled as she echoed his words, &quot;You know I can&#39;t.&quot; She raised 
her sword to guard position, giving him a feral smile.

Ruka nodded, his own sword coming up to the ready position.

Miki raised his hand, intoning softly, &quot;By the ancient laws, let the 
trial begin!&quot;

Their swords met in a flash of sparks, then they leapt back a moment 
before charging forward once again. Back and forth they went, one with 
the advantage, then the other, testing each other&#39;s defense.

&quot;You&#39;re a good as you ever were,&quot; Juri said with a smile.

Ruka nodded, &quot;You&#39;ve learned a few new tricks.&quot; He hated admitting it, 
but Juri was matching him strike for strike. He remembered beating her 
so easily back during their days as guards together.

He tried an overhead blow and she turned it aside, nearly making a 
successful return attack on his exposed body. He heard fabric tear, 
and looked down at the shallow tear across the front of his shirt.

Juri grinned at him, &quot;There&#39;s still time to throw in the towel.&quot;

Ruka just growled in reply, charging her. They fought backwards and 
forwards, each trying to find an advantage, but they were too evenly 
matched. &quot;You can&#39;t defeat me, Juri. I&#39;ll wear you down, eventually,&quot; 
he vowed.

Juri nodded, &quot;You might be right, Ruka.&quot; She brought them close for a 
moment to say to him, &quot;You remember our old sword master? He always 
said you can stop a blade, if you&#39;re willing to pay the price.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Ruka started, thrusting forward. Juri deflected 
the blade just slightly upward, and it buried deeply into her 
shoulder. She grasped the sword&#39;s hilt with one hand even as she 
struck at him with the other.

He felt the blade pierce his heart, even as he looked at her in 
shocked disbelief. Surprisingly, he smiled at her, even as he heard 
Juri swear softly. &quot;Damn it, don&#39;t die,&quot; she cursed, barely catching 
him before he fell.

He heard Miki cry as if from far away, &quot;Victory to the Princess&#39; 
champion, Lady Arisugawa Juri!&quot;

&quot;Well struck,&quot; Ruka managed to say to her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Juri.&quot; And with 
that, he slumped in her arms. The healers rushed forward, and as he 
faded he felt some relief as Juri waved them away.



&quot;He wouldn&#39;t want you to save him,&quot; Juri said weakly to the healers, 
who turned to try and help her instead. She swayed, barely staying on 
her feet as blood trickled down her arm to drip on the floor.

Utena pushed them aside as she rushed to Juri&#39;s side before she 
collapsed. &quot;Were you insane?&quot; she blurted out, easing the blade from 
out of Juri&#39;s shoulder. Blood gushed outward as she finally got the 
sword free.

&quot;An old trick,&quot; Juri managed to say faintly. She noticed that Shiori 
had broken through the crowd to kneel there beside her. The mage was 
crying softly, so Juri forced a smile as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll do anything 
to impress a lady.&quot;

Shiori laughed a bit, through her tears. &quot;You&#39;re absolutely mad, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot; she said, trying to manage a smile for Juri&#39;s sake.

&quot;I&#39;ve been discovered,&quot; Juri tried to joke, wincing a little as Utena 
pressed down on her wound to slow the bleeding. But somehow, she felt 
a bit better, and turned to Utena to see why.

The captain was shrouded in light, a glowing figure garbed as a noble 
prince silhouetting her form. A soft light shown about Juri&#39;s wound, 
and the prince smiled at her once, faintly, before softly and silently 
fading away. Utena lifted her hands and the bloody wound was gone, 
leaving only stained and torn cloth where it once was.

The court was silent as the courtiers and commoners all gazed at the 
Utena and Juri in no little awe. There would be tales sung of this day 
for years to come, of Juri&#39;s victory and then her miraculous healing 
at Utena&#39;s hands. But for now, they all just had to make it though the 
remainder of the day.

Keeping a cool head in a crisis, Miki quickly ordered that the chamber 
be cleared. Anthy had run to the fighters&#39; side even as Utena 
collapsed, as limp as a rag doll. Ironically, Juri helped carry her 
back to the Princess&#39; chambers, where, once Utena finally recovered, 
they gathered to talk. </pre>
