<h1>The Capital Saga (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/capsaga-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Kaoru Miki moved his way along the rows of scrolls and 
books, searching through the titles intently. Once he had been a 
simple soldier, fighting battles with the speed of his sword, but in 
time he grew tired of that life. Study and effort found him in the 
role of courtier, something that he was far more suited for.

        Now, Miki used the tenacity and determination he learned on 
the streets for other tasks, like this research. Finding out the 
information about Mikage was difficult, because legend and fact had 
nearly merged in his case. Some of the tales said he was the evil 
mage who&#39;s castle had once been where Shi&#39;ohtori was now, others 
said he was a general of the ancient High Kings. But he was tracing 
him back, slowly but surely.

        In another one of the books Miki had found a reference to a 
certain chronicle of the Founding Wars, one that he searched for 
now. He reached the section of records he wanted, and carefully 
began shifting the scrolls aside, eventually finding the symbols he 
wanted.

        Miki carried the set of scrolls over to the large table, 
setting it down there. He unsnapped the catches, easing the heavy 
paper open. Carefully he brought the lamp closer, intently studying 
the ancient script. His eyes widened, and he began to read...

        Mikage pushed his long pink hair out of his face, blood 
running into his face. He quickly surveyed the battlefield, his 
soldiers&#39; armor splattered with mud, filth and blood, and came to a 
simple conclusion. They were losing this battle.

        The barbarians had come down from their villages to the 
north, a wave of soldiers spilling over the kingdom of Ohtori. In 
all honestly they were unprepared, years of peace having dulled 
their edge, and the enemy seized that opportunity.

        The border towns fell first, and tales of the massacres had 
swiftly reached the south. The High King rallied their forces, but 
only a skeleton force could be sent out to delay the foe while they 
marshaled a larger army. Mikage had volunteered to take the delaying 
force out, foolishly promising to hold the enemy back.

        &#39;I was too arrogant,&#39; Mikage thought bleakly.

        There were over a thousand soldiers that he had lead forth 
into the crux of arms, but the barbarian army out-numbered them by 
nearly five thousand men. Magic could even those odds, but only the 
great spells of war could possibly turn the tide, ones that no man 
could dare use while their forces were combined in battle.

        &#39;We can&#39;t win this by force of arms,&#39; he thought to 
himself, &#39;it&#39;s time to change tactics.&#39; Mikage ordered his second to 
send the retreat signal. The boy nodded, his short purple hair 
falling into his eyes as he concentrated intently.

        Mamiya had entered his service a few years back, and Mikage 
had fallen in love with the beautiful boy on very first sight. 
Gentle eyes, a kind smile, but still quite capable, he was almost 
Mikage&#39;s ideal man. Quite cautiously he had approached him, and was 
filled with joy when he returned Mikage&#39;s affections.

        A mystical flare shot upwards from the boy&#39;s hands, lighting 
up the entire battle field, and he saw his commanders trying to pull 
back. The barbarian force pressed forward, continuing the 
engagement, refusing to let them retreat. Again and again Mikage saw 
the soldiers fall, and knew he had no remaining choice.

        &quot;Mamiya,&quot; Mikage looked out at the battle as he asked his 
second softly, &quot;can you make sure that none of the enemy disturb me?&quot;

        &quot;None will reach you,&quot; Mamiya drew his sword, &quot;you have my 
oath on it.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Mikage stopped him for a moment, gently 
pressing his lips to the boy&#39;s own in a gesture of farewell.

        Mikage moved off, even as barbarians began to spill forth 
from the battle line. He felt almost sick as he considered what he 
was about to do, but there was no choice left. He centered himself, 
finding his calm place, then reached out to the power that swirled 
beyond this world...

        &quot;I call you, Demons of shadow,
        by crimson blood and lives shed
        Your strength to mine allow
        Fires of Chaos mine to wield!&quot;

        The power surged up from within him, the ground burning all 
around, trees and plants dying from the touch of those energies. 
Crimson fire, a fatal blackness surging up, and the soldiers 
faltered, feeling what was coming. The power was a wave that he 
released across the battlefield, a scythe that cut men down 
indiscriminately.

        Fully half his own force of soldiers were gone in that 
moment, but the enemy fared much worse. The barbarians broke and 
ran, fleeing his powers, even as the battlefield burned.

        Swaying with exhaustion, his strength all but gone, Mikage 
dropped to his knees. &quot;Mamiya,&quot; he murmured softly, but heard no 
reply. He looked up wearily, his vision blurred. Some barbarians had 
attempted to reach the hill, but they had been stopped. A figure lay 
crumpled nearby, and Mikage&#39;s blood ran cold.

        &quot;Mamiya!&quot;

        The guards found Mikage there hours later, cradling the 
boy&#39;s body to him, murmuring to it softly. He seemed numb when they 
took him away, numb to the charges laid by the soldiers that he had 
commanded.

        The King&#39;s tent was opulent, the finery of a traveling war 
leader decked about it, but Mikage seemed oblivious to it all. The 
king&#39;s purple hair fell into deeply sorrowful eyes, eyes highlighted 
by the darkness of his skin. The royal line of Ohtori had borne 
those colors for generations, and none questioned it anymore.

        &quot;Mikage, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the King said softly to his old 
friend, &quot;both for your loss, and what I find I must do now.&quot;

        Mikage looked up, the sky blue eyes meeting his King&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I saved your kingdom for you,&quot; he said bitterly, &quot;and only 
lost the thing I held most dear.&quot;

        &quot;And slew soldiers loyal to me,&quot; the King&#39;s voice was 
sorrowful, &quot;who left wives and families behind, families that are 
now widowed.&quot;

        &quot;There was no choice,&quot; Mikage&#39;s eyes seemed to regain some 
fire then.

        &quot;You should have pulled your forces back,&quot; the King 
continued, &quot;tried to preserve your forces until we could reach you..&quot;

        &quot;You weren&#39;t there,&quot; Mikage bit out, &quot;there was no other 
way!&quot;

        &quot;That may be so,&quot; the King agreed, &quot;but their families will 
call out to me for justice.&quot; There was pain in his eyes as he 
continued, &quot;Justice I must provide them.&quot;

        &quot;Damn you,&quot; Mikage stood, meeting his King&#39;s eyes 
defiantly, &quot;no!&quot;

        Mikage moved to leave, but the King grabbed his arm. &quot;If you 
leave now,&quot; he said softly, &quot;you will be branded a traitor! Stay, 
justice may be lenient..&quot;

        &quot;I have already paid most dearly,&quot; Mikage shrugged off his 
King&#39;s hand. His voice dropped, &quot;I have given my all, and been 
repaid by treachery. So be it.&quot; The mage summoned up a surge of 
power, and the King was flung away.

        A few moments later the King recovered, venturing outside. 
But Mikage was gone, disappeared, and later they would discover that 
the body of Mamiya was gone as well...

        Miki sighed to himself in frustration. The scrolls ended 
with Mikage&#39;s disappearance, nothing more. But still, it shed a 
light on their enigmatic foe. &#39;Obviously he felt betrayed by his 
King,&#39; he thought, &#39;but why does he seek vengeance on Anthy now?&#39;

        The doors to the library slammed open, a page running in out 
of breath, &quot;M&#39;lord, you must come quickly! Wakaba has attacked the 
Princess!&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Miki blurted in surprise. Recovering himself he 
grabbed the scrolls and ran after the boy, determined to find out 
what was going on.

To be continued...

Author&#39;s Note: I was originally going to have Mikage use the Dragon 
Slave spell from Slayers, but decided to make up something similar 
instead. </pre>
