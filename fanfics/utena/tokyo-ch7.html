<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 7 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        The phone rang loudly, startling everyone in the room. It was 
bad enough waiting around there for Utena to come home, then you added 
that Anthy and Juri did not get along at all, and things were getting 
a little tense in there.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Anthy answered the phone.

        &quot;Miss Anthy?&quot; the doorman recognized her voice almost 
instantly. He sounded rather stressed as he said, &quot;There&#39;s an injured 
young woman down here, asking for Utena.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll send someone right down,&quot; she quickly reassured him. 
Anthy hung up and looked at the people in the room, &quot;There&#39;s someone 
downstairs, asking for Utena.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll go downstairs,&quot; Juri volunteered, jumping to her feet.

        &quot;No, I will,&quot; Anthy corrected her calmly.

        Juri narrowed her eyes in anger, &quot;Why?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve been a vampire for longer than I have, and are 
probably stronger as well,&quot; Anthy pointed out reasonably, &quot;if this is 
a trap, you need to be up here watching over the humans.&quot; A bit of 
anger seeped into her voice, &quot;And since you made me into a vampire, 
you should be able to sense if something goes wrong.&quot;

        Juri really looked like she wanted to argue with all that, but 
finally she nodded with a sigh, &quot;All right, you go.&quot;

        Anthy didn&#39;t let herself actually sigh with relief until she 
was safely standing in the elevator going down. She didn&#39;t know why 
Juri bothered her so much, but just being around her set Anthy&#39;s teeth 
on edge. In her most private thoughts, she wondered if it might simply 
be Juri&#39;s honest enjoyment of her vampire state.

        &#39;Keep your mind on business,&#39; Anthy firmly reminded herself as 
the elevator came to a stop on the ground floor. As soon as she 
stepped out the scent of a vampire reached her, then Anthy saw who 
leaned weakly against the wall. &quot;Shiori?!&quot; she cried, running to her 
side.

        Shiori smiled up at her weakly, her face and upper body 
covered with welts and bruises. &quot;What took you?&quot; she managed weakly.

        Anthy got her wits about her and reached out with her new 
senses, trying to find any trace of another vampire nearby. But there 
was nothing. She looked down into Shiori&#39;s dazed eyes and asked, &quot;Is 
Mrs. Ohtori here, too?&quot;

        Shiori shook her head weakly, &quot;I got away from her, barely.&quot;

        &quot;But how...&quot; Anthy started.

        The elevator doors opened up again and Juri ran out, looking 
around her wildly as she cried out, &quot;Shiori?!&quot; She ran over and pushed 
Anthy aside forcefully, gently cradling Shiori in her arms. She saw 
the injuries that the girl carried with her and Juri&#39;s expression grew 
murderous as she hissed, &quot;What did that bitch do to you?&quot;

        &quot;She wanted me to help her find you all,&quot; Shiori said softly, 
&quot;but I wouldn&#39;t do it. When the power of her will didn&#39;t work, she 
fell back on her fists.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;ll pay for that,&quot; Juri vowed softly, &quot;I promise you.&quot;

        &quot;Who will pay for what?&quot; Utena asked, stepping into the lobby.

        &quot;Shiori&#39;s back,&quot; Anthy said, an odd look on her face.

        Utena narrowed her eyes, &quot;We&#39;d better get her upstairs.&quot; Juri 
easily picked up Shiori in her arms, and in a few short minutes they 
were back in Utena&#39;s suite.

        The girl groupies and Wakaba kept their distance, but Ruka 
looked at the purple haired girl with concern. &quot;Will she be all 
right?&quot; he asked.

        Ignoring the question, they lay Shiori down on the couch, Juri 
hovering about nervously. &quot;So hungry,&quot; Shiori moaned out softly. Anthy 
brought a bottle of animal blood out of the refrigerator and Shiori 
looked she was going to be ill, muttering, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

        Ruka brought a packet of the medical whole blood over, tearing 
it open cautiously and holding it to Shiori&#39;s lips, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

        Shiori sucked it back ravenously, her body looking to fuel 
it&#39;s own repairs. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but she wouldn&#39;t let 
me feed off animal blood, just on people that she caught.&quot; Shiori 
looked away, &quot;I got so hungry, I just... gave in.&quot;

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Utena murmured, but there was an odd 
look on her face.

        Anthy looked over at the pink haired woman and came to a 
sudden realization. In Shiori&#39;s shoes, Utena would have just starved 
herself, rather than give in. &#39;Every time I think I understand what 
Utena&#39;s capable of, she surprises me,&#39; Anthy thought.

        &quot;You survived,&quot; Juri agreed, &quot;and made it back to me.&quot; There 
were actually a few tears in her eyes as she added, &quot;That&#39;s enough for 
me.&quot;

        &quot;What happened to you?&quot; Anthy asked Shiori softly.

        &quot;After Mrs. Ohtori took me away from Juri,&quot; Shiori smiled up 
at her sadly, &quot;she seemed to know that you were going to Tokyo almost 
at once. She followed you out here, and has been watching what you&#39;ve 
been doing ever since.&quot;

        &quot;Do you know what Mrs. Ohtori wants?&quot; Utena asked.

        Shiori shook her head, &quot;No. She seemed to simply want to 
destroy you for killing Kanae at first, but after a while she seemed 
to become interested in you. Mrs. Ohtori asked about when you first 
came to school, the confrontation with Akio, all that stuff.&quot;

        &quot;Is she afraid of Utena?&quot; Juri asked softly.

        Shiori seemed surprised at that question, &quot;Not at all. She 
never seemed to be anything but sure and confident when I spoke with 
her.&quot;

        Utena patted her gently on the shoulder, &quot;You should rest 
now.&quot; She looked Juri and Anthy in the eye, &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have more 
questions for you later.&quot;

        Shiori was going to protest that when Juri gently pressed her 
down onto the couch, &quot;You need to regain your strength, love.&quot;

        Shiori sighed softly, &quot;Yes, Juri.&quot;

        Utena led them out of the living room to the closed off 
kitchen to talk.

        &quot;What was that about?&quot; Anthy asked, curious why Utena had 
stopped them from debriefing Shiori about what had happened to her.

        &quot;She&#39;s lying,&quot; Utena said softly.

        &quot;Of course she is,&quot; Juri surprised them both by agreeing.

        &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Anthy blinked.

        &quot;She was in that... woman&#39;s hands for weeks,&quot; Juri said to 
them quietly, obviously not calling Mrs. Ohtori what she really wanted 
to call her. &quot;I felt the awesome power of her will, and I can guess 
what she might have made Shiori do. Of course there are things that 
she doesn&#39;t want to talk about yet,&quot; Juri finished with a growl.

        &quot;And yet,&quot; a thoughtful Utena said softly, &quot;she didn&#39;t seem 
too terribly upset over being held by Mrs. Ohtori, did she?&quot;

        &quot;What are you implying?&quot; Juri asked challengingly.

        Utena met her eyes calmly, &quot;Nothing.&quot; A pause, then she added, 
&quot;Yet.&quot;

        &quot;How dare you,&quot; Juri&#39;s eyes flashed, and she took a half step 
towards the cool Utena.

        Anthy stepped between them, feeling the air charged with 
electricity between the two of them. &quot;Simmer down,&quot; she said 
forcefully, &quot;this isn&#39;t the time or the place.&quot;

        Both women glared at each other for a few moments, but finally 
they backed off.

        Anthy puffed out a relieved breath, when a thought occurred to 
her. &quot;How did you know it was Shiori down there?&quot; she asked Juri 
softly.

        &quot;I made you into a vampire,&quot; Juri answered softly, &quot;there&#39;s 
still a powerful link between us. I could sense who it was through 
you, I guess.&quot;

        Anthy didn&#39;t look particularly happy about that idea. Not 
happy at all.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t get much help from my little visit with Miyu,&quot; Utena 
decided to try and change the subject for now.

        Juri nodded grimly, &quot;Did she have anything to say about Mrs. 
Ohtori?&quot;

        Utena shrugged wearily, &quot;Just that she&#39;s strong, devious, and 
quite vindictive.&quot;

        &quot;We already knew that,&quot; Anthy smiled at them wryly. Both women 
actually laughed a bit of that. She looked at Utena, &quot;Did she have 
anything to say about your powers?&quot;

        &quot;Powers?&quot; Juri raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;Remember when she faced Kanae?&quot; Anthy reminded Juri quite 
pointedly of how Utena had, single handily, saved both of them.

        &quot;Hmph,&quot; Juri frowned. looking downward.

        Utena shook her head, &quot;Just that I seem to be unusual for my 
age, that&#39;s all.&quot;

        Juri shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m going to go check on Shiori.&quot;

        Anthy and Utena stood there a moment, walking her walk away. 
Quietly, Anthy asked Utena, &quot;You were the one who made Shiori a 
vampire, right?&quot;

        Utena nodded slightly, but kept quiet.

        &quot;Could you make Shiori tell you the truth?&quot; Anthy asked.

        The expression on Utena&#39;s face was almost unreadable as she 
softly said, &quot;I probably could.&quot; A short pause, &quot;But I won&#39;t.&quot;

        &quot;Why?&quot; Anthy demanded.

        A grim little smile, &quot;Because I would never let someone do it 
to me, Anthy. I have no right to do that to anyone else.&quot;

        Out in the living room, Shiori and Juri stood at the window, 
looking out into the night. &quot;You have no idea how happy I am to have 
you back,&quot; Juri murmured to her softly.

        &quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; Shiori said to her quite agreeably, but it wasn&#39;t 
Juri that she saw in the reflection of the mirrored glass.

        It was Mrs. Ohtori.

        Shiori remembered the last words Mrs. Ohtori had said to her. 
Her mistress had gently pushed bloody hair from Shiori&#39;s face, &quot;Get 
close to them, learn all of their secrets. And when they least expect 
it, call on me.&quot;
