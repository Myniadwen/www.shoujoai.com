<pre>Juri fought back her disgust, standing there in the shadows of the 
Observatory.

The party at the observatory had begun with sundown, quickly becoming a 
mad, energetic thing. Crowds of humans, mostly pretty young women 
dressed in the skimpiest of clothing navigated the polished floor. 
Couches were set up around the edges of the room, the clear leaders of 
the party reclining on them, vampires all. Over on one side Touga Kiryuu 
reclined with his dog, the kendoist Saionji. Akio Ohtori sat in a place 
of honor, his young bride Kanae absent, obviously enjoying the favors of 
a young lady.

Juri bit back a snarl as Akio forced the girl&#39;s head up and down in his 
lap, turning away from him in revulsion. The others watched avidly, 
barely noticing her own withering glance. Her mane of orange hair flowed 
down her back, contrasting vividly with her pale skin, her eyes piercing 
in the dim light as she scanned the crowd.

&quot;Juri-sama....&quot; a weak voice, barely a whisper, and she staggered from 
the crowd. Her breasts rose and fell softly, her mane of red hair 
flowing, almost matching the streams of blood pouring from the wound on 
her neck.

Juri caught her before she fell, her fury surging. &#39;Someone let her 
bleed out,&#39; she thought, feeling her own hunger rising. Instead she 
mastered her desire, summoning one of the gifts of the vampire, gently 
licking along the sighing girl&#39;s wound. The saliva sealed it, the flow 
stopping even as the girl cooed softly.

They knelt there on the floor, the girl holding on to Juri gently. Her 
eyes were cloudy, now with weakness but burning desire. There was 
another scent in the air, the girl&#39;s sexual musk, and she saw the girl&#39;s 
thighs glistened with fluid. &quot;Please,&quot; she managed softly, tilting her 
head up, breasts rising invitingly.

Juri leaned forward to kiss those gently parted lips, careful not to let 
her fangs cut her delicate lips. She slipped back a bit, moving her lips 
up to the girl&#39;s ear to softly command, &quot;Sleep.&quot;

The girl&#39;s limp body was easily carried towards the empty couch, even as 
Juri scanned the crown for who had wounded this child. &#39;A waste,&#39; she 
thought, searching furiously. The smirk on Touga&#39;s face told the tale, 
quickly changing to fear as he felt Juri&#39;s glance.

&quot;M&#39;lord?&quot; Touga looked up to Akio in appeal.

Akio&#39;s genial nod brought a snort of disgust from Juri, and a 
disapproving glance from him. He shuddered visibly a moment later, 
finishing into the girl&#39;s mouth, then coldly shoved her away with his 
semen dripping from her face. She licked her lips seductively as Akio 
tucked his spent member away, laughter echoing from the male vampires.

&#39;Damn them,&#39; Juri throttled back her anger, so badly wanting to strike 
our against him. Still, Akio had demonstrated his power over her in the 
past and facing him again would merely be an exercise in humiliation...

Juri heard a disturbance at the main door, and they looked up to see the 
large outer doors break as a figure was hammered right through them.

&quot;Who dares,&quot; Touga cried out in surprise.

The crowd parted to give a clear look at the doors, and for the first 
time they saw... her. Instead of normal girl&#39;s clothes she wore a 
traditional boy&#39;s school uniform, the long black pants and jacket 
highlighting her almost bone pale coloring. Long pink hair flowed down 
her back, and her face had the most shockingly blue eyes.

&#39;She&#39;s... lovely,&#39; Juri thought in shock as the woman strode towards 
them. Aloud she asked the others, &quot;Who is she?&quot;

The pink haired woman raised the wooden practice sword that she carried 
and declared, &quot;My name is Tenjou Utena!&quot; Utena pointed with the blade 
towards where Akio sat regally, &quot;And I&#39;m here to challenge you.&quot;

As he rose from his seat Akio tossed his purple hair back with a clearly 
practiced gesture. &quot;I know that you&#39;re upset over how I changed you,&quot; he 
smiled down at Utena charmingly, his voice flowing like dark honey, &quot;but 
that&#39;s no reason to do anything foolish.&quot;

The power washed over Juri and her stomach turned as she felt her 
automatic obedience to the vampire lord. She was shocked to see Utena 
grit her teeth, struggling against that dark power. &#39;How can she...?&#39; 
Juri wondered a bit enviously.

With a single gesture Utena shrugged Akio&#39;s influence off, biting out, 
&quot;Face me.&quot;

Akio gazed over at Utena in surprise and honest confusion, and Juri felt 
glad. He smoothly stepped down, his expression serious as he said, &quot;Pass 
me a sword.&quot;

Touga tossed him a wooden practice sword, &quot;Here, my lord.&quot;

The sword dropped smoothly into Akio&#39;s hand as he smiled bleakly at 
Utena, &quot;You do know that I am the champion duelist of Ohtori?&quot;

&quot;Shut up and fight,&quot; Utena said as she charged him.

The two swords met with a loud crack, testing both muscle and will 
against each other. Utena met his eyes coolly, and Akio&#39;s began to look 
just a bit worried. Again and again they clashed, each of them searching 
for any sign of weakness in the other&#39;s guard. The wooden swords quickly 
began to splinter, the weapons becoming even more dangerous to the two 
vampires, not less.

&#39;This Utena is good,&#39; Juri thought, watching the battle as the vampires 
around her shifted uncomfortably. Akio lashed out invisibly again and 
again with his powers, trying to compel obedience from Utena, but he 
failed.

And it was clearly maddening him. They separated, standing there facing 
each other a moment in the cleared flood of the Observatory. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
understand?&quot; Akio demanded of her angrily, &quot;I am the prince of this 
school!&quot;

Utena stood there calmly, her body almost glowing in a single beam of 
moonlight. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you are a man or woman,&quot; she murmured 
softly, then adding much more loudly, &quot;one of strength and nobility is 
always a prince!&quot;

They faced each other silently, looking for some weakness in each 
other&#39;s guard, even as the crowd watched in awe and a little fear. The 
human servants began to look hopeful, watching Utena adoringly, and even 
the vampires tried to resist her odd charisma.

Touga made his way over to Juri&#39;s side to worriedly ask her, &quot;Do you 
think out lord might... loose this duel?&quot;

&quot;If you had asked me yesterday, I would have said no,&quot; Juri answered him 
quietly, tossing him a dangerous look, making him take a half step back. 
&quot;And have you considered what will happen if he falls?&quot; she murmured 
dangerously.

&quot;Guard yourself,&quot; Utena declared, charging.

Akio raised his sword in reflex, the two wooden blades coming together 
loudly. Utena&#39;s blade shattered, the splinters scattering around them, 
but she firmly kept the hilt in her hands. She deflected his strike, 
taking it on her shoulder, then Utena stepped in close and shoved the 
shattered remnant of her blade into his chest!

&quot;Urk,&quot; Akio spat out a burst of black blood, liquid running down his 
chest. His body fell limply against Utena, then slowly slid down to the 
floor. She pushed the body off of her, and he lay there in a boneless 
heap.

Juri stood there, hypnotized by the seemingly impossible image before 
her. She could hear the others fleeing, the vampires and human servants 
running away from this strange, powerful vampire. The victims lingered, 
looking adoringly at the pink haired young woman and making her visibly 
uncomfortable.

&quot;Get out of here,&quot; Utena said, her eyes flashing, and they fled.

Juri forced herself to move, walking over to where the injured girl lay 
and carefully picking her up. &quot;She needs help,&quot; Juri simply said in 
explanation, meeting Utena&#39;s wary gaze, &quot;and I&#39;ll make sure that she 
gets it.&quot;

Utena swayed slightly and Juri realized that she was clearly exhausted 
from the battle of wills with Akio, but she still forced herself to 
stand up straight. &quot;Then help her,&quot; Utena said coldly, &quot;but make sure 
that&#39;s all you do.&quot;

Juri gave her a not-so-mocking salute and strode from the room, her 
thoughts almost entirely occupied by the woman who stood there behind 
her. &#39;I&#39;ve never seen this Utena before,&#39; Juri thought as she strode 
towards the dorm, &#39;who is she? Where did she come from?&#39;

The door to their dorm room stood open and as soon as Juri entered 
Shiori smiled happily. The violet haired young woman rose to walk over 
to Juri&#39;s side, the skimpy nightie she was wearing highlighting her many 
charms. She looked down at the unconscious girl, then up at Juri 
curiously.

&quot;Brought another lost sheep home, Juri?&quot; Shiori murmured.

&quot;More of a wounded kitten,&quot; Juri set her down gently on the couch. Her 
eyes narrowed in anger as she spat out, &quot;Touga was playing games again.&quot;

&quot;I wonder how he&#39;d fare without Akio to protect him,&quot; Shiori murmured.

&quot;We may soon find out,&quot; Juri smiled once again, her eyes dancing with 
joy as she said, &quot;our lord Akio is dead.&quot;

&quot;Did you...?&quot; Shiori asked eagerly.

&quot;No, a stranger,&quot; Juri said, feeling her blood stirring as she gazed 
over at the nearly nude Shiori sitting so willingly nearby.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Shiori smiled up at Juri seductively, moving her shoulders back 
a bit to bring her breasts forward, &quot;we should have a bit of a... 
celebration?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; a smiling Juri took Shiori by the hand, gently drawing the 
earthy beauty towards the waiting bedroom.

Shiori slipped in front of Juri, letting her hips sway gently for Juri&#39;s 
hungry eyes. She turned once they reached the large bed, the smaller 
girl grasping the bottom of her nightie. She pulled it up over her head, 
casting it aside and letting the moonlight wash across her body. Shiori 
fell backward on the bed, twisting a bit to get a bit more comfortable.

&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Shiori asked sweetly.

&quot;You&#39;re as hungry as I am,&quot; Juri chuckled, remaining fully clothed as 
she slid over the girl&#39;s flushed body. Their lips met in a hungry kiss 
as Shiori pushed her hips up invitingly.

&quot;Oh Juri,&quot; Shiori cooed as Juri let her hands stroke down the girl&#39;s 
sides, carefully staying away from her round breasts, &quot;don&#39;t tease!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s half the fun,&quot; Juri purred in her ear, letting her long fingers 
tease the flesh around those straining orbs. She kissed the base of 
Shiori&#39;s neck, her tongue rough and catlike, enjoying the whimpers of 
desire.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Shiori twisted as Juri finally relented. A hot mouth stroked down 
to tease the breasts, sucking and pulling at the nipples, teasing them 
to greater hardness. Juri luxuriated in that warm flesh, enjoying the 
bringing the red flush to Shiori&#39;s delicate, the heady scent of blood 
just beneath the skin&#39;s oh so delicate surface.

Juri smelled the musk rising, her own hunger pounding, but she forced 
herself to go slowly. Down across the now tightly clenched belly, 
pausing a moment to delicately nip at the bellybutton, then down the 
those now soaked violet curls.

&quot;Please,&quot; Shiori whimpered.

Juri blew across the wetness, chuckling. She looked up, giving Shiori a 
smile as she softly said, &quot;I&#39;ve always liked my blood with a bit of... 
cream.&quot;

Shiori&#39;s cry echoed off the walls as Juri&#39;s fangs nipped her clitoris, a 
spurt of blood striking the back of Juri&#39;s mouth even as Shiori came 
violently again and again...
