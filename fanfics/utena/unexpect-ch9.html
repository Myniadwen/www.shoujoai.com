<h1>The Most Unexpected Thing (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/unexpect-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Touga looked up from the badly exhausted Saionji, taking in Juri 
and Wakaba thoughtfully. They stood together, talking happily, the 
shorter brown haired girl nearly bouncing with joy. &#39;I wonder if Shiori 
ever expected that?&#39; the redhead man wondered.

        Reminded of the purple haired vixen he looked over, smiling to 
himself slightly. Sitting side by side Shiori and Nanami talked eagerly, 
clearly enjoying each other&#39;s company. &#39;I didn&#39;t think my sister had it 
in her,&#39; he mused. They were an odd couple, his intense blonde sister 
and the sultry seducer, but an oddly fitting one as well.

        &quot;My brother&#39;s watching us,&quot; Nanami noted to Shiori softly.

        Shiori looked up, then dismissed him with a glance. &#39;Not that he 
was bad,&#39; she thought as she turned her gaze back to Nanami, &#39;but he 
wasn&#39;t great, anyway.&#39; She gave Nanami a smile, &quot;I&#39;m almost looking 
forward to seeing Juri trounce him.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Nanami said, &quot;he has beaten her before.&quot;

        Shiori looked over to where Juri and Wakaba stood, &quot;Maybe, but I 
think Juri wasn&#39;t fighting for someone then.&quot;

        Nanami didn&#39;t look away from Shiori&#39;s face as she firmly agreed, 
&quot;That can make all the difference.&quot;

        Shiori felt herself blushing, though she wasn&#39;t quite sure why.

        Juri sat on a bench, drinking from a bottle of water as Wakaba 
sat beside her. &quot;Thank you for what you did,&quot; Wakaba said softly, the 
brown haired girl looking at her caringly.

        Juri flashed Wakaba a smile, &quot;It was my pleasure.&quot; A bit more 
seriously the orange haired woman said, &quot;He hurt you, not once but 
twice. Paying him back was worth it.&quot;

        Wakaba bent forward a bit, laying her head on Juri&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;Would it bother you if I admitted seeing you do that to him felt pretty 
good?&quot; she said softly.

        Juri laughed quietly, the vibration shaking Wakaba slightly. 
&quot;You&#39;re human,&quot; she said, &quot;just like everyone else. Besides, Saionji was 
an ass.&quot;

        Wakaba snickered at that.

        &quot;Now there&#39;s just Touga,&quot; Juri murmured. She looked down at 
Wakaba, &quot;I should warn you, he&#39;s beaten me before.&quot; She didn&#39;t mention 
the duels to her, though Juri knew she would have to eventually. It was 
too great of a secret to keep from someone... you loved.

        &quot;You mean in the Duels?&quot; Wakaba looked up at her to ask. She 
smiled gently and squeezed her arm, &quot;I believe in you, Juri.&quot;

        Juri blinked in surprise, trying to absorb the first thing that 
Wakaba had said, &quot;You know about the Duels?&quot;

        &quot;There were always rumors around the campus,&quot; Wakaba said 
softly, &quot;and those signet rings are a bit of a clue.&quot;

        Juri looked at her signet, gleaming in the hall&#39;s light. &quot;You&#39;ve 
got a point,&quot; she admitted softly. She took Wakaba&#39;s hand, &quot;I&#39;ll win 
this for you.&quot;

        Looking up at the clock Juri began to walk over to her place, 
only to be stopped by Wakaba. She undid the scarf from her uniform, 
tying it around Juri&#39;s arm, &quot;For luck.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled, moving over to wait for Anthy.

        Anthy approached the tall duelist with the two roses in hand, 
dressed in her usual school girl&#39;s uniform. An fresh orange rose was put 
into Juri&#39;s pocket, the scent swirling around them as the girl smiled up 
at her slightly, &quot;Good luck.&quot; She paused a second before adding, &quot;And 
Utena said you should go kick his ass.

        Juri laughed suddenly, looking over to see a grinning Utena 
giving her a thumbs up. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri chuckled.

        Touga watched as Anthy walked to him, his red rose glowing 
softly in the light. He gaze Anthy a respectful nod, but his focus was 
on Juri.

        Together they walked over to the squared off dueling arena, a 
large open space for them to move about in. Touga raised his sword 
gracefully, giving Juri a confident smile, his eyes dropping to the 
cloth tied around Juri&#39;s arm.

        &quot;I hope you weren&#39;t hurt in the last match,&quot; Touga purred.

        Juri ignored him, centering herself with a steady breath.

        &quot;Fighters, take your positions,&quot; the referee called out. Juri 
and Touga each walked to their place, their eyes meeting in a searching 
moment. &quot;Ready,&quot; the referee paused for a moment before loudly 
declaring, &quot;fight!&quot;

        Touga stood statue still, his guard nearly perfect as they stood 
there silently, ignoring the call to battle. A whisper of a smile teased 
his face, but his eyes were hard as stone, focused entirely on the 
moment.

        &#39;This is going to end fast,&#39; Juri realized, &#39;the first move will 
be it.&#39; She studied him, searching for the opening, the tiny moment of 
weakness that could spell victory. Seconds dragged on to a minute, then 
Juri saw it!

        Her orange hair streamed behind her like a banner as Juri shot 
across the arena, sword swinging up as she moved. Touga tried to put his 
sword between the blade and his rose, there was a sound like a bell 
ringing, metal breaking, and as the larger piece of Touga&#39;s sword flew 
into the distance as the rose petals blew around them...

        &quot;And I thought only Utena did that,&quot; Touga managed, gazing down 
in honest shock at the broken hilt of his blade.

        &quot;JURI!!!&quot; Wakaba hit her with a flying hug, sending the taller 
girl crashing down to the floor of the arena. &quot;I knew you could do it!&quot; 
she squealed happily.

        &quot;Congratulations,&quot; Touga managed as the entire arena descended 
into bedlam, the young women cheering for Juri.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri wasn&#39;t really paying attention, holding Wakaba as 
she got back to her feet. &quot;We won,&quot; she said quietly.

        &quot;There goes my revenge scheme,&quot; Shiori said, but she didn&#39;t 
sound too disappointed as the stands around them emptied of students 
heading towards the victor.

        &quot;So what are you going to do now?&quot; Nanami asked.

        Shiori gave Utena and Anthy a chance to rush down to the 
celebration before admitting to Nanami, &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot;

        &quot;I think we were going to go have a talk,&quot; Nanami rose, offering 
the other girl her hand, &quot;why don&#39;t we do that?&quot;

        Shiori took the hand, letting Nanami pull her up to her feet. 
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Shiori smiled, meeting Nanami&#39;s eyes happily.

Epilogue: Everything After.

        Juri grinned as she climbed behind the wheel of their honeymoon 
roadster, looking over at Wakaba adoringly. The duels, the tournament, 
they were all in the distant past now, though the consequences were 
still being felt.

        Shiori stood on the steps watching them go, her eyes shining 
with happiness. Standing beside her Nanami held that delicate hand, the 
matching bracelets they always wore gleaming. They had come together 
sometime after the tourney, an unusual couple to say the least. Nanami 
lost her followers for awhile, but she regained her standing eventually.

        Utena and Anthy moved forward, a blushing Utena still holding 
the flowers with a odd smile. Wakaba still had moments when she showed 
jealousy about that, but Juri couldn&#39;t blame her. She still had moments 
about Shiori.

        &quot;Ready?&quot; Wakaba asked with a smile, leaning forward to kiss 
Juri.

        &quot;Always,&quot; Juri whispered back, starting up the car. They pulled 
out onto the road, Juri smiling to herself, &#39;Not that I&#39;d trade Wakaba 
for anything.&#39; She looked at she smiling lover, &#39;Not for anything in the 
world.&#39;</pre>
