<h1>Just Like Clockwork (part 6 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/clockwork-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Juri Arisugawa was sitting along a balcony ledge, her hand draped along 
the smooth stones. Her other hand held a goblet of wine, which she 
sipped minutely now and then. The breeze blew her orange curls across 
her eyes, obscuring her view. But it wasn&#39;t the surrounding forests 
filled with game, or the view of the town in the valley below the castle 
that held her thoughtful gaze. No...it was something a little more close 
to home...

There, in the practice grounds below, near that grove of trees that 
obscured her from the view of the knights and squires practicing their 
drills, was a goddess...

At least, that was what everyone was saying.

With her helm gone, the Guardian of the Mountain was viciously executing 
a series of strikes in the air before her. Her sword flashed gold in the 
rising sun, her lovely pink hair plastered slightly to her forehead with 
moisture brought on by exertion. She would lift her sword, poised above 
her like a statue found in a temple. Then, would bring down the blade to 
cleanly cut whatever imaginary foe stood before her. Again and again and 
again. Strike. Strike. Strike. Her expression seemed impassive to Juri&#39;s 
high vantage point. A serene calmness that was the evidence of a master. 
Or perhaps the wine was causing her to think too much.

&quot;Lovely, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

Juri turned to regard the red haired man walking towards her. His hair 
swayed with every step, spilling across his back like a magnificent 
cape. There had been a time, Juri recalled, when his hair was not 
permitted to be that long. My, how time had changed them all... Taking 
another sip of her wine before hopping down off of her ledge, Juri 
walked over and set it down on the nearby table.

&quot;Hmmm...I suppose. She certainly doesn&#39;t look like a god to me.&quot; She 
arched an eyebrow and folded her arms across her men&#39;s shirt. Touga 
inclined his head in acceptance of her answer.

&quot;No she does not...and yet a god she is. Or at least the powerful 
servant of one. I remember that armor from my boyhood. My family would 
travel with the Kyouichi clan to pay our respects and worship at the 
mountain. The priests would unseal the tomb once a year for 
pilgrimages.&quot; Touga smiled wistfully a bit. He took another draught of 
his own wine, before moving to refresh it at the decanter.

&quot;Oh? I&#39;ve never been. My countrymen do not worship Dios.&quot; She shrugged 
as if it didn&#39;t matter. Indeed, until recent years, her countrymen had 
only followed their own pantheon of gods. But with the new alliances of 
their enemies, the ancient people known as the &quot;Glass Warriors of the 
River Trees&quot; ( the Arisugawa as they called themselves in their own 
tongue) were forced to seek out stronger allies. Which had brought them 
to the doorstep of the Ohtori kingdom, with its many diverse peoples. 
There were no stronger warriors to be found. Several clans of the best 
archers and swordsmen had banded together under King Akio&#39;s rule, and 
had unified as a strong steel arm against the invaders and bandit 
hordes. But...like all things in life...it came with a price...

&quot;Ah that&#39;s right.&quot; Touga gave a nod and lounged on one of the couches in 
the room. Plucking a grape from a bowl that a servant had provided, he 
popped one in his mouth and continued. &quot;A shame King Akio won&#39;t let you 
at least journey home during the Solstice. Perhaps for your recent 
services in his name, we can get him to reconsider this year. You surely 
must miss your sister.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...yes. She hasn&#39;t written for a couple of months. It&#39;d be nice to 
see how she&#39;s doing and check on my father&#39;s lands.&quot; She took a seat on 
a chair, facing away from Touga and his couch. The pompous posture and 
seductive coy gaze he seemed to relish tossing about was nothing new.

&quot;I can always put in a good word for you. But I think your recent 
exploits with catching that sabotaged merchant train, and that defeat of 
the Red Eye bandit horde on our borderlands, speaks for itself. Saionji 
was quite beside himself that you&#39;d gotten there first.&quot; Touga gave a 
warm chuckle that seemed to fill the room. His charisma was one of his 
strongest points. It made him a valuable member of the council. But just 
because he enjoyed decking himself up fancily, (and wearing nearly as 
much jewelry as woman) didn&#39;t make him a slacker with the sword. Having 
dueled with him in the past, Juri had quickly learned that his smiles 
and carefree attitude hid an unbelievable talent for fighting. Many 
underestimated him. Juri wondered how long it&#39;d take to pry him from the 
arms of a woman to get him to spar her again. She was bored to tears 
just patrolling the castle and speaking to diplomats all day.

As she crossed her legs, confident that even now he was watching her 
every movement beneath his lowered eyelids, Juri reclined back and 
stretched.

&quot;My my, Lady Juri...have you been working out?&quot; Touga asked in mock awe. 
Juri looked over her shoulder at him, and gave him a wink. &quot;Why yes, 
Lord Touga...and it would seem that you&#39;ve bought yourself another 
pretty necklace.&quot; Touga preened showing off the heavy jeweled thing 
around his neck as if he hadn&#39;t displayed it there purposefully for her 
to see.

&quot;Oh, you noticed? It&#39;s just a little thing I picked up...the stone in 
the center reminded me of your eyes.&quot; Juri laughed. Although she had no 
real interest in Touga&#39;s attentions, the two of them enjoyed playing 
with each other...little flirts and teases. Something to amuse and pass 
the time while waiting for the King&#39;s beck and call. For her last 
birthday, Touga had bought her a new sword and hired a pair of exotic 
women to dance for her at a private feast. She had been touched by his 
thoughtfulness...and touched by other things later that night...

But now it was time for business.

Turning her chair to face her fellow council member, Juri grew serious 
as she uncrossed her legs and leaned forward slightly. Touga looked up 
at her change in posture but didn&#39;t move. &quot;So tell me, Touga...what has 
brought you here? A private audience generally means you have something 
on your mind...&quot;

Touga gave a nod, taking another grape.

&quot;Yes...I actually wanted to speak to you about the possibility of war.&quot;

Juri&#39;s aquamarine eyes narrowed. They were the kind of eyes that moved 
like the ocean. Sparkling and clear one moment, dark and alluring the 
next. And when she was angry...as stormy and full of rage as white caps 
from a hurricane. Touga stared back into those eyes with a serious gaze 
of his own.

&quot;War...with who exactly? I thought our enemies were still stocking up 
for their next raid campaign...they surely couldn&#39;t have amassed enough 
resources for a full-out war.&quot; She shook her head as she spoke, making 
her tangerine curls bounce along her shoulders and back.

&quot;No, not from the nations to the north. It&#39;s a bit more serious than 
that...according to our spies, there seems to be a rebel faction 
building within our own lands. And they appear to be quite...intent on 
removing our king from rule. They have a network of caravans and secret 
locations from which they are readying weapons and armor.&quot; Touga stood 
at last, and began pacing slightly on his soft leather boots.

&quot;We fear some of our allies have turned against us. But we&#39;ve only 
managed to capture a few of the grunts. And they haven&#39;t revealed 
anything of use. This group is extremely secretive and well-organized.&quot; 
He turned over his shoulder and gave her a look. Juri caught the meaning 
of his words and scowled.

Juri Arisugawa, one of the heirs to the noblest lines within the 
Arisugawa, was forced to remain as a hostage within the kingdom. She was 
given a high position of course, the status of one of the King&#39;s own 
consultants and a seat on the High Council that governed the kingdom. 
But it was still empty. She could never return to her homelands, could 
only fight as a mere second to the General Saionji (Stupid hulk that he 
was), and remain a bargaining chip to keep her people from ever thinking 
of rebelling against Akio&#39;s wishes. Not that they ever would. She was 
beloved by her people. And yet was just a pawn in these games...she 
hated it...

&quot;My people are not involved. You can rest assured of that. Our loyalty 
to our allies is never in question.&quot;

&quot;But of course not, Lady Juri. I wouldn&#39;t dream of accusing you. As I&#39;ve 
stated before, your funding and skills have aided our country countless 
times. However there is a backer out there, who is providing funds to 
these heathen rebels. King Akio is not pleased. They need to be rooted 
out and dealt with, before war scars this country as it did in the 
past.&quot; Touga ceased his pacing and moved to look out the window, 
presumably at the Guardian down below.

Juri moved to stand beside him, letting her hands rest on the balcony 
ledge. The Guardian was speaking with a group of soldiers down below, 
the worship and love on their face plain to see even from this distance. 
The men were pausing in their drills and practices to watch the tall 
armored woman.

Feeling restlessness set in, Juri ached to hold her sword. It wasn&#39;t the 
first time her position bothered her. She often went down to the 
training grounds to burn away her agitation through severe sparring 
matches. Yet no matter who she fought, with the exception of perhaps 
Touga or Saionji, she never found any real challenge. The men here were 
too weak...she needed something with teeth.

Something like...a god perhaps...

Smirking slightly, Juri turned to Touga.

&quot;Hmmm...Perhaps I can go and commune with your goddess about this 
matter. See what she&#39;s like and perhaps respectfully glean where her 
intentions lie. Maybe even offer myself as a source of information for 
her. Surely Princess Anthy has much to do with initiating herself as a 
noble...&quot; And won&#39;t be around to distract the Guardian. Juri thought 
privately. Out of sight and out of mind and all that. Besides, Touga had 
already gotten to see the Guardian up close without her helm...Juri 
Arisugawa wanted a turn too. &quot;The presence of the &#39;Holy Warrior&#39; in our 
castle is surely well known by now throughout the land. That sort of 
gossip tends to spread like wild fire. Perhaps it can be used to our 
advantage.&quot;

Touga smirked back and rested a hand on his hip as he flipped his hair 
over his shoulder. &quot;Taking advantage of a goddess? Isn&#39;t that a little 
blasphemic?&quot; Juri turned for the door, and began pulling on her riding 
gloves from her pocket. She picked up her dark blue doublet from off the 
chair by the door, as she opened it to leave.

&quot;What can I say? I&#39;m a bad girl...&quot;

Utena had just finished up a lengthy conversation with the training 
master of the castle, who had been living here since he was a boy. His 
information had been informative and useful, and helped her to get a 
better idea of the way things were run here, and who all the important 
players were.

Firstly, there was the General Saionji. A man she knew all too well, and 
liked even less. But his strength was great and his adherence to 
tradition and duty unwavering, as was his loyalty to his position as 
leader. He had never left a man in the field, and had always been first 
in the front lines for battle, instead of remaining in his tent like 
many generals did. As such, he held great respect from those he 
commanded...even if it was touched with a bit of fear.

Then there was Touga, the King&#39;s right hand man. He worked as an advisor 
of sorts, along with flirting with anything that had two legs and a pair 
of breasts. (That bit of information wasn&#39;t given by the training 
master...that was added in as a foot note by herself.)

There wasn&#39;t much to be said for the Queen Kanae apparently. In fact not 
much was seen of her really...odd that. Her husband, Akio was most 
definitely running the show. She was a kind figurehead, generous to her 
people when she was seen. And she was also said to be very beautiful. A 
trophy wife, Utena decided distastefully.

Then there was Juri Arisugawa. The man hadn&#39;t said too much about her, 
except she was a banshee with a sword whenever she came onto the 
practice field. She was politically active, taking on dignitaries from 
neighboring realms and acting as a representative for several of the 
smaller clans that had been absorbed by Ohtori. She was a member of the 
High Council, of which Touga and Saionji also served on.

There was one other member...but like Kanae, little was known about him. 
A recluse who&#39;s intelligence and clever mind had earned him the name 
&#39;Thinker&#39;. He also happened to be a mage of notable power. He wasn&#39;t 
often seen about the castle...if ever. Nothing else was known.

Utena sighed, as the man left. Anthy was away at a hearing today. The 
lovely dark-skinned princess was acting on behalf of her brother to 
listen to a requests for money from distant towns that had been besieged 
by bandits. And if Utena was honest with herself, it made her feel 
lonely. This was the first time they had been separated since the 
clockwork knight had awoken from her cryo-sleep in that dank cave. She 
missed having the smaller woman to walk by her side... Did Anthy miss 
her? Probably not. She was probably so busy concentrating on her meeting 
that she didn&#39;t notice. It wasn&#39;t anything new for Utena. It was a 
soldier&#39;s job to protect the politician. It wasn&#39;t the politician&#39;s job 
to care.

And besides...why was she moping about anyway? This was practice for 
Anthy, Akio had said. She would re-learn how to act as a leader and a 
noble by taking on the smaller duties of a member of the royal family. 
She was a sort of under-study, Touga had added when Utena had received 
the news. Her status of Princess was not widely accepted. Or agreed 
with. So she had to begin building a reputation as a competent noble, 
who acted as an extension of the King. That part was utter bullshit, 
Utena thought. This wouldn&#39;t have had to happen if they hadn&#39;t treated 
her like some sort of disease. Like a..a free prostitute to be passed 
around!

And why was that? Why had Anthy been treated so? Akio had given in a 
little too easy, she had thought...maybe it was his fear of her &#39;power 
from Dios&#39;...but something was off about it all. What were the reasons 
for all of this...?

As she thought to herself, Utena walked through the side portal that led 
out of the practice grounds and to the armory, turning towards the 
smithy where the black smith was attempting to try and fix her helm. 
Having worn it for so long, she hated to be without it. She was 
attracting more stares than usual, damn it all. Besides...it...it came 
from Crown Prince Dios and...she could never regain those days again... 
It was all she had left of him. Of the life she knew, and the world she 
had once fought so hard for. She couldn&#39;t bear not to hold onto 
everything she still had left.

Depressed and head buzzing with memories of the past...a past that (for 
her) had been the present a mere week ago, Utena headed to meet Ungar. 
He was where he always was, before the hotly glowing forge hammering 
away at a new spear head. A stack of spears lay in the corner. He 
grunted and looked up when Utena walked in, making the sign of the god 
with his hand as he bowed his head reverently. She smiled and gave a nod 
in return, tying back her mane of pink hair into a long ponytail with 
one of the leather strips lying on the work table.

Ungar was a massive burly man, with a thick mustache and an even thicker 
accent. He was missing an eye, having lost it to an arrow grazing years 
ago. His back and arms was a network of scars, some from battle and 
others from forge burns. But his skills were renowned as being the best 
in the kingdom, such that he worked in the king&#39;s own forge. As she 
neared him, he lumbered over to another table, where her helm still lay 
in two pieces. Utena lifted an eyebrow as she turned to look at him 
again.

&quot;Nnngh. Ungar unable to...fix helm. Too strange. Metal is not like metal 
of the type Ungar knows. Ungar knows much types, but this is not of the 
earth. Ungar can not fix this thing...it made with...magik...&quot; He 
grunted out a bit fearfully, making a sign of protection with his hands. 
He bowed to her and handed Utena the pieces, who took them gently back 
in her gauntlet-covered hands. He shrugged and rubbed his neck, looking 
like a child who had gotten scolded by its mother.

&quot;Nnngh...me sorry High Guardian.&quot;

Utena shook her head stiffly, upset by the news. &quot;No no, nothing that 
can be done. Thank you anyway.&quot; She turned on her heel and left, 
cradling her broken helm with one hand as she moved. Her cape fluttered 
behind her with the dusty breeze that had kicked up. What was she going 
to do now? She ran a hand across her face, trying to wipe away the 
tiredness she felt.

&quot;You seem tired Lady Guardian.&quot;

Looking up somewhat startled, she found a beautiful orange curled woman 
sitting astride of a black steed to her left. The woman wore clothing 
that pertained to the males of this region, Utena noted. Clothing 
similar to what she herself wore underneath the ecto suit of armor. And 
that, she found herself thinking, made her look all the more striking...

The woman smiled and dismounted.

&quot;Forgive me if I am disturbing you...Guardian.&quot; The woman seemed to find 
the word awkward rather than awe-inspiring (which just interested Utena 
all the more). &quot;I was hoping to find you at the practice field but you 
had gone. If it isn&#39;t impertinent, might I have a few moments of your 
time?&quot;

Utena regarded her, the lenses in the cyborg&#39;s eyes shifting and 
clicking through different filters a moment, as internal sensors gave 
her a mental readout on the other woman. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
And she didn&#39;t seem like she was looking for trouble.

&quot;Certainly. But may I ask who you are first my Lady? I&#39;d like to know 
who I am addressing.&quot;

The other woman&#39;s smile broadened. &quot;You could. But if I tell you mine, 
I&#39;d like to know yours.&quot;

The answer caught Utena off guard, and her eyebrows rose. Who was this 
woman? She wasn&#39;t acting like any of the other castle staff or nobles at 
all. It was almost as if she had no idea who Utena was supposed to 
be...or rather, didn&#39;t care. Utena shifted her helm to her other arm, 
and put a hand on her hip. &quot;Rather bold of you, don&#39;t you think?&quot; She 
asked with a sarcastic lilt to her voice. The woman gave a small barking 
laugh and gestured to herself.

&quot;I am bold by nature, it&#39;s how I retain my place here at the castle. But 
my name, as you&#39;ve requested, is Juri. Juri, daughter of the Arisugawa, 
if you want the full version. And I must say, you look...quite different 
up close, than you had when we first met.&quot;

Utena gave a small nod of understanding, more to herself than to Juri. 
Ah so she&#39;s that Juri Arisugawa. &quot;Yes, we met under rather unpleasant 
circumstances. I recall you sitting at the table with the king.&quot; Utena 
gave a small smile of amusement, which sounded in her tone as she went 
on. &quot;You looked somewhat bored at the time.&quot;

Juri gave a small shrug and a wave of her hand. &quot;I was. Affairs of state 
are dull, don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise. But your arrival 
certainly did much to alleviate the tedium. Say,&quot; She looked about a 
moment as if checking for something before leaning down a bit in her 
saddle to regard Utena more carefully. &quot;Would it be alright to find a 
more comfortable setting to talk? I&#39;d like to speak with you at length, 
if it&#39;s not too much to ask. I&#39;d been hoping to get a chance to meet 
with the much-talked about Guardian of the Mountain.&quot;

Utena thought for only a moment. A chance to meet with a High Council 
member in private was beneficial to her mission specs. And besides, on a 
more personal level, the pink haired knight found herself liking this 
confident woman. She seemed to have a level head and quick wits. 
&quot;Alright then, where shall we go?&quot;

Juri leaned back in her saddle and gave another flash of white teeth. 
&quot;Have you got a horse? There&#39;s a lovely well a little ways from here, 
that has a shaded area to sit on. We can speak without worries or 
interruptions there.&quot;

The corners of Utena&#39;s mouth lifted in a small secretive smile. &quot;Oh 
don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t be needing a horse. Lead on.&quot;

Juri gave her a look of confusion as Utena just continued smiling.

Kozue Kaoru was something of a mystery about the castle. She was often 
seen coming and going, flitting on the edges of shadows one moment and 
then dancing grandly in a sparkling gown at a feast the next. But no 
one, not even the servants, were quite sure what exactly she was. A high 
ranking noble woman? A privileged servant perhaps? Or a simple maiden 
who had found favor with the King? But one thing was certain, despite 
the lack of knowledge of her personal life, she was the sister of the 
&#39;Thinker&#39;. However, she seemed to be the one who did more thinking.

And none of those thoughts were kind.

Standing in the shadowed window sill of one of the upper level castle 
rooms, Kozue watched as Juri and the Guardian went off in the direction 
of the woods. Juri was galloping her steed full-out, with the mechanical 
clanking god running alongside. Kozue lifted her eyebrows 
appreciatively. That Guardian was nearly like a gazelle, ( a creature 
found only on the grass plains on the Arisugawa lands). Wonderful to 
watch...but in the end, just meat for a lion.

And Kozue was certainly feeling catty.

Giving a small &#39;hmph&#39; under her breath, she turned away from the window 
and reclined back on the stone wall. She had been watching and reporting 
the Guardian&#39;s and Anthy&#39;s movements ever since they arrived at the 
castle. Watching from the sidelines, hidden along the network of 
corridors of stone and marble. King Akio desired to be constantly aware 
of just who they spoke to and what all they did. But so far things had 
been quiet. Nothing at all had occurred or taken place that was worth 
any real interest. Except for that duel on the Sacred Rose Grounds...

The short-haired woman&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. That had been quite 
entertaining. Saionji had been made an utter fool, and no one had seen 
him since. He&#39;d probably mope for days and then go back to barking out 
orders on the practice grounds and swinging his sword around again. So 
predictable.

Flicking her fingertips through her blue tinted hair, Kozue stalked off 
in the direction of the underground levels of the castle. The castle 
itself was impressive when seen from outside. But it&#39;s true size wasn&#39;t 
discernible at first. It was nearly double it&#39;s viewable size, with 
several floors and caverns extending out below the surface of the land 
it rested on. Such construction lended to its formidable strength in the 
face of attack and siege. And it also allowed private places to be 
concealed from public view...

The servants who cleaned and worked above ground weren&#39;t allowed to 
descend below. No, an entirely different staff was reserved just for 
that purpose, living forever down below until they were retired and 
changed out. Never seeing the light of day during their services. And 
steps were taken so that they never spoke of the private rooms and 
armories contained below... Kozue suppressed a shiver of delight as she 
headed down a secret branch of winding stairs. She was privileged. All 
of the highest ranking nobles and select people were. She was allowed to 
come and go as she pleased, unhindered, answering only to the King 
himself...

And she relished every moment of it.

She continued down the flights of stairs, wishing she were bold enough 
to try out that new contraption her genius brother had devised. It was 
an elevating platform, working on a series of cranks and pullies, that 
allowed a small group of people to stand on it and rise to and fro from 
the upper levels without having to take the stairs. But frankly it made 
her nervous, and she simply continued to trust her own legs. The High 
Council used it though. As did the King when he came to rule his 
underworld here...

It was quite interesting, the way this castle operated. The Guardian 
wasn&#39;t aware of it yet, from what Kozue had spied out, but it would be 
accurate to think of the lower levels as an entire castle on its own. Or 
perhaps an upside down castle, since the most important things were kept 
here... At last she reached the floor she wanted, and she exited the 
Infinitum Stairs by a side portal.

Well, despite how tiring it was to climb back up, at least these 
seemingly never-ending stone steps kept her in shape. Kozue moved down 
the hallway, her simple yellow dress swishing quietly along the floor 
and her slippered feet making no discernible sound. Torches and oil 
lamps kept the place lit with enough light to make out the various 
doorways that lined this particular hall. It was always darkness here. 
Always night time. But night time was when wild animals were most 
active, Kozue thought to herself. Ignoring the first seven, she came to 
the eighth door and paused. Her brother most likely would be in his 
workshop. And at this hour, none of the servants would be around to tidy 
things. A perfect opportunity to pay a visit to her much loved twin...

Pushing open the wooden door, whose hinges were well-oiled to prevent 
any sounds from escaping, Kozue let herself in with a growing smile.

Inside the large workshop were shelves and shelves of books, all lined 
neatly to form a private library apart from the main one downstairs. In 
contrast, several tables and workstations were jumbled all about, piled 
with strange contraptions and vials of unknown liquids. On the walls, 
brightly lit torches usually kept the workshop of Miki Kaoru well lit 
and bright, with overhead iron chandeliers to add even more light. Many 
of his instruments and tools were delicate things made of very fine 
metal or gold and silver. Crystal globes and statues lined one table 
Kozue passed, a couple of them holding electrical light and glowing 
smoke. She paused to look at a small statue of a butterfly, carefully 
crafted to look as if it was about to take wing.

Inside the head were miniature glowing gears, imbued with magik. She had 
seen the toy before, and in fact held its twin in her chambers. When 
activated with a tap on the head, it would flutter its wings and 
actually hover about in the air. Miki had made it when he was only 13 
years old and still an apprentice mage. Her gaze softened at seeing it, 
fond memories rising. With a shake of her head, she moved on, navigating 
her way with ease to the deepest part of the room.

Miki was at a low table, using a pair of strange hook tools to tinker 
with something or other he was absorbed in. The only light in the room, 
save for a rare torch now and then, was the glowing egg-shaped crystal 
he had set on a stand. Mage-light softly poured from it, a gentle 
white-blue that outlined the curve of his shoulder through his silk long 
shirt, and threw out the rich highlights of his lighter blue hair. 
Kozue&#39;s hair was darker, and tended to have a bit more wave. But her 
brother&#39;s hair was thick and silken, tantalizing to run your finger&#39;s 
through. She licked her lips as she ghosted up behind him.

Miki sighed out loud as he once more dropped the tiny component he&#39;d 
been carefully maneuver into place. His latest invention was a device to 
improve one&#39;s sight, allowing a person to see objects leagues away 
without the use of magik. But it was so tricky to try and get the tiny 
bits of glass and metal into...

He stiffened in surprise as he felt his sister&#39;s arms drape themselves 
along his neck, sliding to dangle loosely on his chest. But as he felt 
her press into his back and lay a head on his shoulder, he relaxed, 
recognizing the scent of her favorite perfume. Smiling he cocked his 
head to look at her, setting down the tools in his hands and removing 
his gloves.

&quot;Oh, hello Kozue! I wasn&#39;t expecting to see you today. I thought you 
would be coming by tomorrow--&quot;

&quot;It is tomorrow, my dear brother. You&#39;ve been cooped up in here for two 
days.&quot;

Miki&#39;s face slackened in surprise, then burned with embarrassment as he 
ran a hand through his hair. &quot;A-Ah, sorry about that Kozue...I must have 
lost track of time again. It&#39;s a rather bad habit of mine...&quot; He gave 
her a sheepish smile, which tugged a smile of Kozue&#39;s own.

&quot;I know...but don&#39;t worry about it. Be more concerned with yourself. 
Have you eaten at all?&quot; She traced a fingertip along his cheek, watching 
his eyes go back to his latest invention again. Feeling the featherlight 
tickle run down his jawline and along his neck, he gave a small shake of 
his head and brought his attention back to her again. He smiled, 
cheerful and calm just as he always did.

&quot;Yes...a couple of the servants came by and brought me a platter of some 
meats and fruits. They&#39;ve been taking dinner rolls and adding cheese and 
things inside them, to make it easier to eat and work. Very considerate 
of them.&quot;

What he didn&#39;t know was that Kozue had instructed them to do so. Her 
brother, as much as she cared for him, would lose himself in his work 
sometimes so much he wouldn&#39;t even notice if he&#39;d been on his feet for 
days. More than once she&#39;d found him passed out on the cold stone 
flagons, exhausted beyond measure.

Her grip on him tightened as she pressed her cheek along his neck. Miki 
automatically leaned his head to the side to rest on her own. &quot;Well 
that&#39;s good...but what about sleep? You really need to take better care 
of yourself you know. If the King needs you to perform a protection 
spell on a party, or cast for the weather...what am I to tell him when 
you can&#39;t even stand up?&quot; Miki chuckled at her stern tone, the sound 
musical and carefree.

&quot;I&#39;ll be alright Kozue. No need to worry. I&#39;m sorry that I haven&#39;t been 
visiting you regularly and making you come all the way here. It must be 
hard for you.&quot; He noticed her hands seemed to stray on his chest a bit, 
rubbing along the silk as if she needed assurance that he was really 
there. He felt an old sadness well up, regret that he hadn&#39;t always been 
there to be by her side when they were children. But despite their 
painful past and the trials they had both undergone, his precious twin 
sister had grown to be a lovely lady of the court. Elegant and 
intelligent, seeing her now as an adult filled him with a brotherly 
pride.

&quot;Hmph, well I think you work too hard. You should come to court 
sometimes, it&#39;s boring without someone to talk to.&quot;

Miki looked at her finally. Really looked at her. His blue eyes seemed 
to bore into hers with an intensity she rarely saw from him, crackling 
almost with an electricity that seemed to jump straight through her and 
making her gasp. Seeing him like that...so mature...so...so...

&quot;Are you really lonely there, Kozue? You have no one to talk to at all?&quot; 
The question was asked lightly without a trace of ulterior motive. But 
paranoia rose in Kozue, making her wonder just how much her brother 
knew. Did he know about the little trysts with the King? Her secretive 
services to him, providing him with information among other things? The 
other people she spent time with, the small loyalties she won with more 
than just her wits at times? With an ease born from telling so many lies 
over the years and from acting in front of her brother, Kozue pouted.

&quot;Oh those stuffy dignitaries don&#39;t count Miki. I can&#39;t really talk to 
them.&quot;

The answer seemed to satisfy him, and his gaze returned back to his 
worktable. His face was cheerful and relaxed as he chuckled, making his 
back shake slightly. Kozue pressed her chest firmer into his back, 
tracing circles on his collarbone. The playing field was once more in 
her favor, just as it always was.

&quot;Well then sister, I suppose you just need to make more friends. Oh, I 
nearly forgot. Here, I made something for you.&quot; He reached into a drawer 
on the side of the desk, his body bending slightly with Kozue&#39;s bending 
with him. As he sat back up, he leaned back into her arms and held up a 
small gold locket. On the front was a carefully stylized &quot;K&quot;. He leaned 
his head back to look at her sideways as she lifted her hand to recieve 
the gift, opening it.

&quot;See the crystal face? I spelled it with a couple of runes. If you touch 
it and say the word &#39;Time&#39;, the o&#39;clock that it is right that moment 
will will appear for a short time. It works based off of the sun and 
moon&#39;s alignment, like a sun dial. Only instead of light, it draws 
energy. This is very accurate...and I thought...you know...since you&#39;re 
always down here Below, it could be useful since there isn&#39;t any sun...&quot; 
He trailed off shyly, looking a bit shamefaced that he was the reason 
she probably was down here so often.

Kozue smiled and pressed lips onto his forehead. &quot;I love it. Thank you 
Miki.&quot; Smiling happily at her words, he gestured at it eagerly.

&quot;Try it out! I have a couple of them made but they&#39;re fairly difficult, 
and the spells have to be relaid once a year. Took quite a bit to figure 
it all out, so I only have four right now. But one day...who knows? 
Maybe everyone could have one. And at least the other mages wouldn&#39;t 
have to lug their big heavy staffs and crystals around just to see what 
time it is.&quot;

As Miki spoke, Kozue did as he had bid and pressed a fingertip to the 
uncovered blank crystal face. At her whispered word, the crystal glowed 
white for a moment, before dimming. Then, before her eyes, numbers began 
to scrawl across the surface in glowing blue lines as if an invisible 
hand wrote them. They remained a moment, before disappearing to leave 
the crystal blank once more. Kozue smiled and clasped her hands about it 
appreciatively.

&quot;Oh it&#39;s simply fantastic Miki. Such a clever trick! But then you&#39;re 
always so clever...&quot; She whispered into his ear, reveling as he gave a 
small unconscious shiver. She ran a finger over the bags under his eyes, 
watching his eyelashes flutter shut. &quot;You haven&#39;t been getting enough 
sleep.&quot;

He shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m alright...and I&#39;m always learning more. That&#39;s what 
the King has brought me here to do, so I--&quot; his words broke off sharply 
as he gave a yawn. Kozue arched an eyebrow.

&quot;So &#39;you&#39;ll be going to bed&#39; you mean.&quot; He looked up at her, his 
forehead creasing in a pouting frown.

&quot;But I haven&#39;t finished!&quot;

&quot;Yes you have.&quot; She helped to lift him up by the shoulders, tugging up 
under his arms to get him to stand. He resisted only minutely, clearly 
dead on his feet.

&quot;But if I don&#39;t finish this before our next campaign...&quot;

&quot;You can finish it after you&#39;ve gotten some sleep.&quot; She led him away to 
a small narrow door, hidden in an alcove in the back. The door opened to 
a small bedroom that Miki used when he stayed over at the workshop too 
late to return to his quarters. Which was more and more often as of 
late. Coming through the doorway side by side was cramped, and the room 
wasn&#39;t even a quarter the size of her own apartments within the castle. 
But she didn&#39;t mind. Everything from the pages of hand-written notes on 
the small desk, to the sheets and tangled comforter of his bed smelled 
like him. That sweet scent of soap and vanilla that was all his own. She 
helped him to remove his boots as he sat on the edge of his bed, and 
then stood to lift his shirt up and over his head. He yawned again.

&quot;Haaaaa...Thanks Kozue. I&#39;ll just rest for a bit I suppose. I probably 
won&#39;t make dinner up Above again though.&quot; His chin lowered onto his 
chest as she bent close to unslide the belt from its loops. He hadn&#39;t 
noticed earlier, but he was tired. He&#39;d sleep then...only for a little 
while... Standing he moved over to the edge of his bed and made to lie 
down, but paused as he saw Kozue removing her dress. Looking up at her, 
his eyebrows quirked in confusion.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; She looked over at him with that stern expression 
again, that cool no-nonsense gaze she would use on him when they were 
younger and he was being silly.

&quot;This room is freezing. That tiny little grate in the corner can hardly 
be called a hot box. Those coals have practically died.&quot;

He shrugged massaging at his eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to get around to 
that. Devise a better furnace or commission the blacksmith to find a way 
to project the heat out better.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not fixed. And those covers are practically ice. So I&#39;m 
going to help you stay warm until you fall asleep.&quot; Miki watched in 
slight bewilderment as she stripped down to her shift and crawled into 
his bed. It was really a bit too small for two people. He crossed his 
arms, suddenly feeling unreasonably naked without his shirt. It was only 
Kozue after all.

&quot;Kozue...we aren&#39;t children anymore...it&#39;s silly to share a bed now.&quot; 
But Kozue simply patted the bed next to her, unrelenting.

&quot;No...we&#39;re not children anymore...now hurry up. You should be asleep by 
now.&quot; Miki hesitantly nodded and climbed in next to her. They shifted 
around until at last they were both comfortable, bodies pressed closely 
together with Kozue&#39;s legs hooked along his own. He sighed, feeling 
warmth begin to spread across his body under the protection of the 
coverlet. The dim room was only lit by a single candle on his desk, 
lending a tranquil sort of ambiance. He could feel Kozue&#39;s breath on his 
neck, her arm draped over his waist. Slowly his eyes began to close, 
comforted.

But a niggling thought wormed its way through his mind, feeling the rise 
and fall of his sister&#39;s chest on his arm, and the slight shift of her 
thigh as she moved closer to him. Was it really okay to sleep together 
like they used to? They had always been together...twins from birth. 
They shared everything, from food to toys to memories. Having her beside 
him was like being next to a half of his soul. She completed him, and he 
felt lonely without her there. But now they were adults...did siblings 
still act so close at their age?

It seemed a little...taboo...but he couldn&#39;t really tell. Their 
closeness bled across everything in his life, making it difficult to 
judge what was socially acceptable. Especially after they had been alone 
for so long. Still...sometimes her eyes seemed to change when they 
looked at him. Did she sense it too? Did it matter? Maybe he was 
worrying about nothing. But...she was at the age for marriage now...a 
young maiden...one day she&#39;d belong to another man, a stranger who 
would...be doing those things with her...

His hand moved to settled on her arm as he fell deeper into his 
approaching sleep.

He couldn&#39;t imagine life without his sister...

Slowly his body relaxed into slumber, his chest rising and falling with 
every shallow breath. Kozue watched him in the darkness, her blue eyes 
glinting in the flickering candle light. She reached up a hand to stroke 
away the bangs that had fallen into his eyes, marveling at the smooth 
hairless chin, and the cherubic face that had grown paler over the 
years. Leaning up on an arm, she lowered her face over his own, 
breathing in his scent directly and studying his features. That 
face...so much like her own...like looking into a more masculine 
mirror...kissing those lips was really like kissing yourself. A bit 
narcissistic really...

As she leaned down to gently place a kiss onto those soft slack lips, 
she felt that electricity again. The feeling that came with doing 
something she shouldn&#39;t. Nearly without her control, the kiss deepened 
as her tongue flicked out for a taste. She moaned quietly as Miki slept 
on, too exhausted and deep in his dreams to register his sister&#39;s 
actions. Her hand moved of its own accord, to glide lightly along his 
smooth slim chest beneath the covers.

Yes...she loved this room...she loved her brother...and she loved that 
special bond she shared with him... He belonged only to her...safely 
tucked away in his underground cage.

Miki twitched in a dream as Kozue rose up above him, balanced on her 
hands and knees so only her lips touched him.

...The candle on the desk fluttered in a slight breeze and guttered 
out...

Resting on the edge of a stone well which lay in the heart of the woods 
on the castle grounds, Utena leaned back and enjoyed the breeze. Beside 
her Juri stood and combed her horse&#39;s coat, the black hair gleaming with 
every pull of the currycomb. The orange curled woman looked over her 
shoulder at the resting knight, who was simply enjoying the wind 
filtered in through the trees.

&quot;This is my favorite spot on the grounds. It&#39;s quiet and the twilight 
flowers that blossom here at night are simply divine. It&#39;s also a good 
place to speak of private matters.&quot;

&quot;Private matters?&quot; Utena looked over at her at last, her face calm and 
regarding. &quot;What sort of matters did you wish to discuss? You expressed 
a wish to speak at length...so I gather this is of a semi-serious 
nature?&quot; She found Juri staring back at her bemused. Eyebrows lowering 
as her brow creased, Utena cocked her head. &quot;What? What is it?&quot; Juri 
just shook her head amazed.

&quot;You kept up with a horse at full gallop...and you aren&#39;t even sweating. 
Not even out of breath.&quot;

Utena gave a small nod. &quot;Yes.&quot;

Juri threw up her hands in defeat. &quot;I suppose it was wrong of me to 
doubt you. You truly are the &#39;Right Hand of Dios&#39;.&quot;

Utena shrugged. &quot;I do as I was constructed to do.&quot; Was her calmly vague 
reply. Juri finished and moved over to take a seat next to the 
pink-haired woman. They sat in silence for a time. Then, &quot;I noticed 
you&#39;ve been observing the castle and its staff... is this for the sake 
of your duty of being our judge?&quot; Utena regarded her for a moment before 
speaking.

&quot;Yes. My task requires I know the affairs of state, and weigh this 
kingdom&#39;s current situation against its ruler.&quot; Utena blew upwards as a 
pink curl floated into her face, freed from its restricting ponytail. 
Juri gazed at the sword on her belt, admiring the golden thorns and 
curling leaves that made up the handle. The rose at its end was crafted 
with amazing skill. She would give much to possess such a sword.

&quot;In that case, Lady Guardian, might I offer myself as a source of 
information?&quot; The question made Utena look over at her again, her eyes 
holding suspicion. Juri was entranced by the way her eyes would pulsate 
with a blue glow now and then.

&quot;You could...but I find myself wondering why you would.&quot; The sound of 
metal shifting on stone followed as Utena turned her body to face her 
speaker. Juri gave a small self-depreciating bow at the waist.

&quot;My task within the Ohtori kingdom is to ensure things run smoothly and 
hostilities are avoided. With a god here, one who is inspecting the 
country I serve, obviously I can only do my best to offer whatever will 
make these proceedings go smoothly.&quot; Utena noted that her words were 
spoken elegantly and easily, as if they had been practiced. This one was 
cunning, she needed to be cautious.

&quot;Then I welcome any assistance you can provide. Is there something in 
particular you wanted to tell me?&quot; Juri&#39;s lips quirked into a smile as 
she leaned forward, her eyes never moving from Utena&#39;s own.

&quot;Actually, there is...&quot;

&quot;Princess! Oh Princesssssss!&quot; A cheery call awoke Anthy from her daze. 
She had been in meetings all morning, and only now had been able to call 
a recess for the day. Her head ached, but seeing Wakaba looking so 
energetic and cheerful perked up her spirits.

&quot;Hello Wakaba. How are you?&quot; The girl bounced up, holding a bucket of 
water in both hands and a rag. Her face bore a wide mischievous grin.

&quot;I just got back from the Guardian&#39;s chambers, cleaning it from top to 
bottom and taking a look around! But...there&#39;s never any real point.&quot; 
She pouted. &quot;She doesn&#39;t seem to keep very many things. Just the 
offerings people leave her...and those are all piled on the table.&quot;

Anthy smiled and they walked side by side down the hall. &quot;Well...the 
Holy Knight seems a bit...spartan in her decorating. More like the 
squires here at the castle or the knights in the barracks, than a maiden 
of any sort.&quot; Wakaba made a face. &quot;Ewww...she should at least put up a 
few tapestries...even Lord Saionji has more things in his room than she 
does.&quot;

&quot;Who can question a god?&quot; came Anthy&#39;s reply. The two women headed in 
the direction of Anthy&#39;s chambers, pausing at Utena&#39;s door. Wakaba 
opened it, seeing Anthy pause a moment and bite her bottom lip.

&quot;She isn&#39;t there...and no one is really sure where she went. She&#39;s 
somewhere on the grounds though for sure.&quot; Anthy frowned at this, 
suddenly feeling vulnerable without the calming presence of the taller 
woman. Where could she be if no one knew where she was? It wasn&#39;t like 
she was easy to miss...could she have...

Anthy looked down at the stones at her feet, wondering if somehow Utena 
had wandered down to the lower levels of the castle...her brow creased 
with concern...

&quot;Hmmm...she was at the training grounds earlier...maybe she&#39;s still 
around there? Would you like me to go and find her?&quot; Anthy shook her 
head, tapping the side of her leg through her dress. Giving a small nod 
to herself as she made a decision, she motioned for Wakaba to follow 
her.

&quot;I have a way to find her...but we mustn&#39;t be seen.&quot;

&quot;Ooooo!&quot; Wakaba&#39;s eyes lit up at the thought of adventure, and together 
the pair went into Anthy&#39;s chambers and locked the door. Once safely 
inside, Anthy took a seat at the table where she and Utena had shared 
breakfast the day before. Smoothing out her skirts, the cinnamon-skinned 
woman pointed to a bowl across the room.

&quot;Could you fill that with water and bring it to me?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; With a bounce in her step and her high ponytail swishing, 
the servant girl returned with the requested item moments later. As she 
gently set the bowl down in front of Anthy, careful not to spill 
anything, she leaned back and smoothed down her plain brown dress. 
&quot;Anything else, Princess?&quot;

&quot;Yes...hand me that bouquet of roses in the window, and those shears on 
the dresser. This is a rather simple spell...&quot;

&quot;A spell! Oh my, so the rumors are true! Amazing!&quot; Anthy winced at that, 
and Wakaba flushed in embarrassment. &quot;E-err I mean...umm...&quot; Wakaba 
hesitated as she moved to the window, her back to Anthy.

&quot;S...Sorry. I meant no disrespect, your majesty. Please pardon my loose 
tongue.&quot; She turned and curtsied deeply. Anthy gave her a sad smile and 
shook her head.

&quot;No...no it&#39;s quite alright, Wakaba...I know what...what they say about 
me. And there&#39;s...some truth...to what they say.&quot;

Wakaba&#39;s face turned sad as she came up again. &quot;...Does Lady Utena 
know?&quot;

Anthy turned away shamefaced, her tanned cheeks flushing. &quot;...I...I 
haven&#39;t had the courage to bring it up.&quot;

Wakaba approached her side, setting the shears and roses down next to 
the bowl. She hesitantly placed a hand on the shoulder beneath the rich 
velvet dress. &quot;Um, it&#39;s not my place to say, your Highness...but I think 
Lady Utena isn&#39;t the sort of person to hate anyone for past mistakes or 
being what they are. She seems to care about you a lot.&quot;

Anthy shook her head, feeling sullen. &quot;Actually I think she is only 
caring for me. I don&#39;t believe she has any real...affection 
or...friendliness towards me especially.&quot;

Wakaba looked at her seriously, her normally joyful expression one of 
determination. &quot;Do you want her to?&quot;

Anthy flushed hotly all the way to her ears as her hands spasmed in her 
lap. &quot;I-I...I-I&#39;m not really...err...it&#39;s most disrespectful 
towards...Um...&quot;

Wakaba cackled gleefully, forgetting herself and smacking the princess 
fondly on the arm. &quot;Ho ho! So you dooooo! And I bet you&#39;re trying to 
think of a way to get her to notice you more! Oh my look at you. I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve ever seen you anything but calm!&quot; Anthy managed to get 
herself under control, still blushing hard as she gave a small cough 
into her hand.

&quot;Then you haven&#39;t known me long...Regardless, it&#39;s not proper for a 
woman who is trying to play at being princess to suddenly throw herself 
all over a deity.&quot;

Wakaba scoffed and waved a hand in the air to dismiss such old fashioned 
notions. While she spoke Anthy began clipping rose petals and placing 
them in the bowl of water.

&quot;Well I&#39;m just saying...there&#39;s some of us here who hope you aren&#39;t just 
playing, and that you&#39;re going to work hard to be a good Princess for 
us. I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t people around here who don&#39;t hate your 
guts, but not all of us agree.&quot;

Anthy quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Your tact is impeccable as always. But thank 
you, Wakaba.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I need all the help I can get...&quot;

Wakaba smiled sweetly as she went on. &quot;Yes...and besides, Lady Utena&#39;s 
quite a catch, eh? I mean, you have seen her naked and all.&quot; Wakaba 
cackled again as Anthy&#39;s blush returned with a vengeance, the images 
coming unbidden. Blushing so hard she felt as though she was going to 
pass out, Anthy waved a hand demurely. &quot;As did you. We&#39;re all women, 
it&#39;s not as though it meant anything.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...that&#39;s not really true you know. I&#39;ve heard stories about that 
council member...what&#39;s her name again? Funny sounding...Juri 
Arisuga-ga?&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa&quot; Anthy corrected somewhat clipped. Her expression settled 
into a cool blankness. Wakaba didn&#39;t seem to notice.

&quot;Yeah her. I mean...I bet if she saw the Guardian naked, she wouldn&#39;t 
have just sat there in a chair watching. Ho ho no!&quot; Wakaba laughed gaily 
and went to turn down the covers of Anthy&#39;s largely regal bed. Anthy 
however remained stiff in her chair. She knew Arisugawa all too 
well...and had spent more than one night at the other woman&#39;s mercy. She 
could be very aggressive when she wanted something...

&quot;I wonder though...about that scar that the Guardian had. It looked like 
it would have been a killing blow.&quot; Anthy stirred at Wakaba&#39;s voice. She 
shook her head and went to work pricking a finger on the sharp point of 
the shears.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...perhaps one day we&#39;ll be able to ask.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...oh hey, are you starting? I wanted to watch!&quot; Wakaba came over 
and moved the other chair so that it was next to Anthy&#39;s own. The brown 
haired maid put her chin on her hands, resting her elbows on the table&#39;s 
surface. Anthy gave a nod and dipped a bleeding fingertip carefully into 
the bowl. The red droplet of blood swirled out strangely, making a rune 
shape as it did so. When she lifted her finger out, she let her hand 
hover over the surface of the bowl. Closing her eyes, Wakaba watched as 
hair-thin threads of crimson light began issuing from the palm of her 
hand to grow in number. They wafted gently on an invisible breeze, like 
palm fronds underneath the ocean waters. When an entire ball was formed 
of the glowing red light, Anthy let it sink into the surface of the 
scrying bowl, where it began to glow.

&quot;Wow! Incredible! And you&#39;ll be able to see Lady Utena with that?&quot; 
Wakaba gushed as she watched with wonder.

Anthy gave a slow nod. &quot;Yes...she carries a small thread of my power 
with her, because of the tie between us. I&#39;m using that to locate her. 
The image should clear up in a second.&quot;

As they watched the bowl, the rose petals floated across the still water 
to form a ring around the edges. The bowl&#39;s contents were crystalline, 
smoothly perfect so that they looked unreal. Suddenly an image began to 
come in focus. It was of the mechanical knight and none other than Juri 
Arisugawa, sitting on a well in the middle of the woods, chatting at 
length together. Both look comfortable sitting there, engrossed in their 
conversation. Anthy felt a sharp barb of jealousy sting her insides.

&quot;Oh wow, that&#39;s her!&quot; Wakaba gave a low un-ladylike whistle. &quot;She moves 
fast.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s hand clenched into a fist, as she worked to keep her expression 
clear. &quot;...I&#39;m certain they are just discussing...politics perhaps.&quot; 
Wakaba&#39;s eyebrows lifted in a show of disbelief. Anthy tried again. &quot;And 
there&#39;s hardly anything I could say if the Guardian wishes to speak to 
the high-ranking dignitaries here in the castle. There is the prophecy 
of her judgment after all...it is Dios&#39; will.&quot;

Wakaba lifted her hands as if to let Anthy have her way. &quot;Fine 
fine...but they seem awfully ducky sitting there in the woods. I didn&#39;t 
even know there was a well there.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s jaw clenched a bit as her eyes narrowed. In the scrying bowl, 
she watched as Juri &#39;accidentally&#39; dropped her riding glove and Utena 
bent to pick it up. Wakaba watched her reaction, and gave a 
long-suffering sigh.

&quot;Jeez...look, why don&#39;t you do something nice for the Lady Guardian 
then, if it&#39;s bothering you. Something to win her favor. She 
seemed...homesick in the bath. Why don&#39;t you bring her something that 
reminds her of home later? You know...as a present. Aren&#39;t there 
like...ruins that the miners discovered nearby? Hey yeah, we could go 
check them out and see if we can find a trinket or something lying 
around!&quot; Wakaba clapped her hands together, becoming excited about her 
own idea

Anthy looked up at Wakaba in surprise. It was a marvelous idea! She knew 
of the cave and its ruins that Wakaba spoke of. It had been an 
accidental discovery, the miners having fled in fear after realizing 
what they were standing in. As far as she knew, it was avoided for the 
most part, only visited by pilgrims and traveling mages and bards now 
and then as a sort of attraction. Nodding her head in agreement, Anthy 
smiled.

&quot;I like that idea. It&#39;ll be half a day&#39;s journey if we start out now, 
and we&#39;ll need horses and provisions. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything 
to find, but at the very least it&#39;ll get us out of the castle.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean I can come too? Oh please, your highness?&quot; Wakaba was 
practically squirming in her chair.

&quot;But of course, Wakaba.&quot; The servant girl gave a cheer. &quot;After all it&#39;s 
only proper that a noble woman have a lady-in-waiting to tend to her 
needs and provide her company on the road.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful! Ooooo, I&#39;m so excited now...should we take some soldiers 
with us in case we meet bandits? Are you even allowed to leave the 
castle? What about the King...&quot; Wakaba looked a little nervous now, 
fidgeting with the hem of her skirt. Anthy frowned, feeling a strange 
sort of rebellion rise in her. She was a Princess now, by the Holy 
Knight&#39;s own decree...she would leave if she wanted to.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can trust the men here...er, to not slow us down?&quot; 
Wakaba caught the meaning of her words and gave a quick nod of 
agreement. &quot;As for getting out of the castle, leave that to me.&quot;

&quot;Alright then! In that case leave the other arrangements to me! I&#39;ll 
have everything ready in two shakes of a lamb&#39;s tail. I&#39;ll come for you 
when all is in readiness, Princess.&quot; Giving another curtsy, Wakaba 
sailed out the door. Left with her scrying bowl, Anthy looked on with a 
growing crease in her forehead. The gnawing jealousy in her gut grew 
with every smile Juri gave.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed...taking on his entire private force, forcing your way 
down the mountain, and then leading our dear little Princess back to the 
castle. Your skills are the stuff of legends.&quot; Juri complimented, making 
Utena give a wry grin.

&quot;Well it was a little more difficult than you make it sound. But thank 
you.&quot; Juri gave a nod. &quot;Thank you also for the information about your 
current military standings with the country to the north, and that rebel 
group here within Ohtori lands...foreknowledge of such a thing could 
prevent civil unrest. I&#39;ll give it some more consideration. Should you 
learn of anything else, I would be grateful if you could pass it on.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Lady Guardian.&quot; Juri looked down at the broken helm that 
Utena had set on the forest floor at their feet. It&#39;s alien glyphs and 
shining metal seemed otherworldly on the pine needles and leaves.

&quot;Your helm...you had trouble at the smithy this morning?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Was Utena&#39;s curt reply. She frowned down at it from between her 
knees. Juri stretched as she spoke.

&quot;There is a fellow within the castle who might have better luck. He&#39;s a 
mage and an inventor. A genius really, and incredibly brilliant with his 
hands at such a young age. He holds high favor with the King. While I 
don&#39;t really know him personally, I could perhaps introduce the two of 
you if you&#39;d like...&quot;

Utena looked over, her dark expression clearing. &quot;I&#39;d be quite 
interested in speaking with him. This helm is of great importance to 
me...if he can fix it, I&#39;d be in his debt.&quot;

Juri chuckled as she tucked a curl behind her ear. &quot;Oh I imagine he&#39;d 
find reward in just getting to see you up close. He&#39;s a hermit with his 
workshop, but he loves to see interesting things. And who could be more 
interesting than you? I&#39;ll introduce you to Miki tomorrow perhaps, if I 
can find him.&quot;

Utena nodded, adding a mental note to the data she had been steadily 
creating since interviewing the High Council member. A chance to meet 
the reclusive Kaoru would be beneficial in more ways than one. &quot;You have 
my thanks Lady Juri.&quot;

The two of them stood, as Juri headed over to her horse and mounted. 
Utena walked alongside, the two of them following a path out of the 
woods. The sun was shining brightly through the leafy canopy above them, 
throwing up golden highlights in the horsewoman&#39;s mane of hair. Utena 
found her eyes wandering over that athletic body, which moved 
confidently with the horse&#39;s gait. Once or twice she caught the 
aquamarine gleam of Juri&#39;s eye peeking back at her, checking to see if 
she was still there.

As they came out of the thicket, and into the grassy clearing, Utena 
halted. The horse slowed beside her as Juri looked about. Seeing 
nothing, she turned to regard her companion.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Utena stood stock still, not even breathing as her ocular lenses shifted 
into magnification mode. The internal computer system that was wired 
into her nerve impulses and the cerebral functions of her brain began 
kicking out streams of data, as her improved sight zoomed out across the 
grass plain near the castle gates. A pair of horses was leaving, moving 
at a gallop to ride towards the east. And Anthy was on one of those 
horses. Green digital boxes tracked the horses, biological and speed 
calculations streaming in hypertext across Utena&#39;s sight. For Juri&#39;s 
part, she only saw the clockwork knight&#39;s eyes blaze blue like a pair of 
meteors, lit with a liquid fire.

Eyes shifting back into normal mode, Utena checked her sword in her 
sheath as she spoke.

&quot;The Princess Anthy has just left the castle grounds and is heading east 
with a servant. Destination unknown. Protocol is to follow and lend my 
protection, and determine the reason for the excursion. Then bring the 
Princess back safely to the castle.&quot; Utena said, her tone crisp and 
robotic. Juri tightened her gloves, checking that her sword was strapped 
to her saddle. There was an excitement in her eyes.

&quot;I see. You amaze me once more. So then, Holy Knight...shall we go after 
them?&quot;

Utena gave a nod, strapping her helm onto the other side of her sword 
belt so that it wouldn&#39;t fall off. &quot;Indeed. Your assistance is 
welcomed.&quot;

Juri smirked and flicked her reigns. &quot;Always glad to help.&quot;

The pair took off in the direction of the retreating horses, a cloud of 
dust kicked up in their wake. A flock of crows was startled and took 
wing, cawing and flapping noisily towards the safer spires of the castle 
top. And high above it all, standing in silhouette in the window of the 
highest tower, Akio Ohtori watched silently. A dark smile widened his 
lips...</pre>
