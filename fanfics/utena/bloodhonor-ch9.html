<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Utena, Anthy and Juri left the old dorm as a group, walking out into 
the darkness together. &quot;I need to go do something,&quot; Juri said to Utena 
softly.

Utena looked at her questioningly, then a light seemed to dawn. The 
pink haired girl nodded as she said seriously, &quot;Be back soon, OK?&quot;

Without another word, Juri was gone. She raced across the campus, 
arriving at her own dorm. She slipped inside the building silently, 
startling Ruka. &quot;Juri, back home already?&#39; Ruka said, clearly 
surprised to see her so soon.

&quot;I&#39;m going back out,&quot; Juri answered. Softly she said, &quot;If I don&#39;t 
return, take Shiori and flee Ohtori. It will be far too dangerous for 
you to remain.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Ruka started to ask her, only to have her disappear on him once 
again. &quot;Good luck, Juri,&quot; he whispered.



Utena could feel it, an icy shiver of cold running into her very 
bones. She knew there were vampires hiding here. &quot;How many did you 
think you saw?&#39; she asked Anthy quietly.

&quot;It was too dark to be sure,&quot; Anthy answered. &quot;More than three, at 
least,&quot; she sighed. The stake in her hand felt good, and she pulled 
another out to pass to Utena.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena answered.

&quot;Can I have one, too?&quot; Juri asked from behind them.

Anthy moved like a shot, the stake in her hand suddenly poised 
directly above Juri&#39;s heart. They stood there motionless for a few 
moments, then Anthy flipped the stake around, handing it to Juri blunt 
end first.

&quot;Try not to hurt yourself with it,&quot; Anthy murmured.

Utena watched them and sighed, wondering if trying to get these two to 
work together had been such a good idea after all. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she 
said shortly, leading them into the building. The first room was 
empty, moonlight streaming in from the holes in the roof.

Anthy put her hand on the inner door, throwing a glance back at the 
two vampires behind her as she said, &quot;Be ready.&quot; She pulled the door 
open, and then swiftly stepped back, giving Juri and Utena some room 
to move.

Utena leapt forward, seeing the figure laying there still and silent 
on the floor. &#39;At least there&#39;s no scent of spilled blood,&#39; she though 
to herself, a bit relieved. Wakaba&#39;s chest rose and fell slowly, her 
breathing that of someone fast asleep. Utena looked up as Anthy and 
Juri walked in after her, and felt her heart chill.

The vampires Anthy had seen lined the walls of the small room, all of 
them standing and waiting for some reason.

&quot;Get Wakaba out of here,&quot; Utena told Anthy quietly.

&quot;Sorry, Utena,&quot; Juri noted, &quot;but they&#39;re blocking the door, too.&quot;

Anthy hefted her stake, looking at they young men that were moving to 
surround them. &quot;I don&#39;t see any women here,&quot; she murmured softly.

Utena left Anthy kneeling down by Wakaba and stood, looking around her 
calmly. &quot;Where is Kanae?&quot; she asked the vampire boys grimly.

&quot;Right here,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice answered them. The thin, green hared 
woman languidly strolled out into the center of the room, gazing at 
them curiously before turning to Utena to ask, &quot;You&#39;re the one, aren&#39;t 
you?&quot;

&quot;The one, what?&quot; Utena answered. She noticed the men shifting, spacing 
out so that they were evenly spread around the four of them.

&quot;The one who slew my Akio-sama,&quot; Kanae answered levelly.

Utena silently signaled for the others to be ready as she said, &quot;Yes, 
I was.&quot;

&quot;Die,&quot; Kanae hissed, and the vampires charged.

Juri grabbed one by the throat, driving the stake home into it&#39;s heart 
and then turning to another, then another. A vampire nearly managed to 
jump her, when Anthy drove a stake through it. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri said 
to her with a smile.

&quot;I did it for her,&quot; Anthy nodded to Utena, &quot;not you.&quot; She turned and 
threw a stake, it cut through the air to drive home into another 
vampire. She killed them so efficiently, simple and precise motions 
that ended vampires.

Utena stopped a vampire lunging for Wakaba and staked him coldly. 
Again and again the vampire boys fell, dropping like flies as the 
three of them efficiently dealt the final death to them. And in the 
background, Kanae waited.

The final vampire fell, and Kanae still stood there silently watching 
them. &quot;What is she waiting for?&quot; Juri hissed angrily.

Almost as if she had been waiting for that cue, Kanae was suddenly a 
blur, picking up Anthy and then casting her up hard against the wall. 
The girl barely had a chance to cry out before she made a wet thump as 
she hit, falling silent to the ground.

&quot;Anthy!&quot; Utena cried out.

Juri barely even got her guard up when Kanae was upon her as well. 
Their eyes met in a silent battle of wills, both standing rigidly 
still. Juri bit her lip, a trickle of blood running down from the 
corner of her mouth as they fought on silently. Then, her eyes rolled 
up in her head and she slumped to the ground bonelessly.

&quot;Alone at last,&quot; Kanae murmured.

Utena stood and faced her, meeting the green haired girl&#39;s eyes with 
her own blue ones. &quot;Do your worst,&quot; Utena invited her calmly.

&quot;I intend to,&quot; Kanae answered.

The air in the room itself seemed to dance with an electric charge as 
they gazed at each other. Their wills clashed like swords, invisibly 
tangling in the air between them. Neither moved or swayed for long 
minutes, still like statues.

&quot;Is that... all you&#39;ve got?&quot; Utena managed to ask.

&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; Kanae finally murmured. She looked at Utena in an 
expression of wonder, her eyes wide, &quot;I cannot break your will.&quot; A 
smile, &quot;I&#39;ve finally found someone worthy.&quot;

&quot;Worthy?&quot; Utena asked, hefting the stake in her hand.

&quot;To face me, of course,&quot; Kanae smiled, and charged. She was fast, 
unearthly so, but Utena made herself match her speed and met her blow 
for blow. Fangs gleaming, they leapt around the little room, meeting 
with savage force.

&#39;Anthy&#39;s dying,&#39; Utena thought grimly, &#39;I have to...&#39;

&quot;Distracted,&quot; Kanae smiled coldly, hammering Utena to the ground with 
a massive blow.

Kanae watched curiously as Utena lay on the floor. She forced herself 
up to her knees and spat some blood, feeling something inside her torn 
and broken. &#39;If I don&#39;t win,&#39; she realized, &#39;we are all dead.&#39; She 
rose on shaky legs, then stood, ready to face her again.

A warmer smile from Kanae, &quot;Your will is impressive.&quot; Kanae met 
Utena&#39;s eyes, trying to compel her with her will, &quot;Serving me would be 
so much easier, Utena. Give in,&quot; she looked over to where Anthy lay, 
&quot;and I&#39;ll give her to you as your reward.&quot;

Something seemed to happen behind Utena&#39;s eyes, almost like a switch 
being thrown. &quot;She&#39;s not yours to give,&quot; she snarled, and attacked 
with a new fury.

Kanae tried to defend herself, avoiding and blocking some of Utena&#39;s 
blows, but found herself giving up ground again and again. &#39;That&#39;s 
it,&quot; Kanae oddly murmured. Loudly, &quot;I&#39;ll kill her, Utena! I&#39;ll kill 
them all if you let me!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Utena growled, a feral aside of her now fully unleashed. Again 
and again she attacked, bones breaking and flesh tearing as Kanae 
suffered under strike under strike.

Kanae met Utena&#39;s eyes, and she was startled by the clarity now 
visible in Kanae&#39;s eyes. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured, then charged at 
Utena at top speed. Utena raised the stake in her hand automatically, 
and Kanae skewered herself on it quite deliberately.

&quot;Why?&quot; Utena managed.

&quot;I never wanted this life,&quot; Kanae said to her softly, &quot;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s 
finally over.&quot; She slumped to the floor, the life flowing right out of 
her.

Utena looked down at her in surprise, then she remembered she had 
other things to deal with. &quot;Anthy,&quot; she said her name, shaking her 
gently.

&quot;Utena,&quot; Anthy smiled at her weekly. Blood soaked the front of her 
uniform, and Utena realized that Kanae had ripped the girl&#39;s throat 
out even as she threw her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t more help,&quot; she 
managed, then faded out.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare die on me,&quot; Utena cried, but it was useless. She 
looked around her wildly, then her eyes fixed on the stunned Juri, and 
a forbidden idea suddenly occurred to her. &#39;Anthy may not forgive me,&#39; 
Utena thought, &#39;but I don&#39;t care.&#39;

&quot;Utena?&quot; Juri managed as Utena shook her awake.

&quot;I need you to turn Anthy,&quot; Utena said intensely.

&quot;What?&quot; Juri blinked at her in surprise.



Anthy felt herself returning to wakefulness, something that came as a 
bit of a surprise to her considering that she had thought she was 
going to die. But why was her throat so dry, a thirst filling her with 
such great need?

The door opened and Utena walked in, carrying a bowl with her. 
Whatever was in it smelled wonderful, and saliva was soon filling 
Anthy&#39;s mouth. &quot;What is that?&quot; she managed to ask, something making it 
difficult to speak. She could feel her tongue brushing up against 
something sharp at the front of her mouth.

&quot;Just think of it as chicken soup,&quot; Utena sat on the bed beside her, 
holding the bowl up to Anthy&#39;s mouth. Soft slurping noises, and Utena 
gently tipped it up until it was empty.

Anthy felt much better as she finished up the bowl of warm, salty 
soup, her eyes opening a crack to look into the large bowl. The fluid 
remaining was thick and red, and she recognized what it was almost 
instantly.

&quot;Blood,&quot; Anthy whispered, her eyes wide. She tore herself free of the 
covers, looking down at her pale form in shock and horror. &quot;What have 
you done to me?&quot; she cried.

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; Utena said quite forcefully in reply. Softly, 
she added, &quot;I asked Juri to do it.&quot; She looked at the bowl sadly, &quot;I 
made sure it was animal blood we fed you.&quot;

&quot;So I won&#39;t have to feed on humans,&quot; Anthy murmured softly. She swayed 
there, dazedly, then Utena caught her before she fell.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Utena asked her worriedly.

&quot;If feels like I can almost taste the air,&quot; Anthy managed to say, &quot;I 
can hear the heartbeats of everyone in the building.&quot; Her eyes got 
wide as she said wonderingly, &quot;I never knew there where so many shades 
of color.&quot;

&quot;Focus,&quot; Utena urged her. &quot;I know your new senses can be overwhelming, 
so focus on something!&quot; Utena grabbed her chin, making Anthy look at 
her, &quot;Focus on me. Listen to my words, what I&#39;m saying and how I&#39;m 
saying it.&quot;

Anthy gazed at Utena, her eyes dilated, her breath coming faster. 
&quot;Why?&quot; she asked her softly, &quot;Why did you have her change me?&quot;

Utena met her gaze, &quot;You&#39;ve become too important to me.&quot; She sighed 
softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I couldn&#39;t bear to loose you.&quot;

&quot;You... care about me?&quot; Anthy asked quietly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Utena admitted to her quietly. The pink haired girl looked 
down, to avoid the piercing gaze she was receiving. &quot;More than I 
realized,&quot; Utena said softly.

Anthy took Utena by the chin, gently pushing her eyes back up to meet 
hers. &quot;Me, too,&quot; Anthy murmured, and gently pressed her lips to 
Utena&#39;s.



&quot;Do you think they&#39;ll be all right?&quot; Shiori asked. The purple haired 
girl was as pale as Juri now, standing there on the balcony in the 
safety of her lover&#39;s arm.

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Juri smiled. &quot;Wakaba and the other girls are going along 
to take care of them,&quot;: she added with a smile.

&quot;How did Anthy take it?&quot; Shiori asked with a smile.

&quot;Not well,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;but she&#39;s adaptable. They&#39;ll be all 
right.&quot;

&quot;You promised them that you&#39;d watch over Ohtori for them, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 
Shiori asked Juri with a wry smile.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Juri admitted. She smiled down at Shiori, &quot;But I hope 
I&#39;ll have some help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; Shiori smiled up at her. &quot;Look, they&#39;re getting 
ready to go,&quot; she pointed down to the courtyard far below.

They had fixed the old RV up, as well as making a few modifications. 
The back was completely screened from sunlight, the windows all 
painted over with black. &quot;A bit ugly,&quot; Utena shrugged, &quot;but I guess 
it&#39;ll do for now.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll get us where we&#39;re going,&quot; Wakaba shrugged as she and the girls 
loaded up the RV. &quot;Where are we going, by the way?&quot; she asked.

&quot;To hunt other vampires,&quot; Anthy answered. Becoming a vampire had 
drained her skin of much of it&#39;s dark coloring, making her change even 
more dramatic. She smiled gently at Wakaba, &quot;Thank you, for coming 
along.&quot;

Wakaba looked at Utena a moment before quietly saying &quot;Where she goes, 
I go.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll follow Utena-sama,&quot; the leader of the girl groupies insisted.

Utena sighed, &quot;Well, thank you anyway.&quot;

Utena, Anthy and the girls climbed on board, Wakaba taking the 
driver&#39;s seat. Anthy smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s head for Tokyo, first. I 
understand there&#39;s a girl named Saya, and another called Miyu, that we 
could investigate.&quot;

&quot;Tokyo it is,&quot; Utena agreed.

Wakaba started the engine up, and they were off.

Author&#39;s Note: This is not the end of the series. Don&#39;t panic! I&#39;m 
just taking them out of Ohtori for a while, and will be starting up a 
new storyline. </pre>
