<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 11 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;Utena no Baka!&quot; Lum yelled, flying along behind Utena, who was 
running as quickly as she could. Lightning crackled around the flying 
girl, then discharged towards Utena.

&quot;What did she do, exactly?&quot; Dita asked cheerfully.

Benten shrugged eloquently, &quot;I think she looked at Lum&#39;s new darling.&quot;

&quot;What, Kozue?&quot; Dita said, surprised.

&quot;Lum!&quot; Kozue ran past them towards the rapidly disappearing figures, 
&quot;It was just a friendly hug, really!&quot;

Benten pushed her hair out of her eyes and sighed, &quot;I&#39;d better go 
after them.&quot;

Dita waved bye cheerfully, then decided to go look for Mr. Alien 
again. Life had been rather interesting, since the Nirvana had arrived 
here. She didn&#39;t think this was Earth, exactly, but it was an 
interesting place.

Renamon and Rika walked by and waved, and she waved back.

There was such a variety of people here! Both males and females, and 
they all interacted together. Of course, some more oddly than 
others...

Juri had a little storm cloud floating above her head, trying to 
ignore the herd of girl-groupies following behind her. &quot;Would you just 
leave me alone&quot; she cried.

&quot;She&#39;s so strong willed,&quot; one girl declared.

The others all sighed happily.

Dita made a note and moved on.

&quot;Look out!&quot; a voice cried and she jumped back. A youma ran by her 
first, then right behind it came the Sailor Senshi, Knight Sabers, and 
various other costumed heroes.

A masked woman dressed in mostly pink and white offered her a hand, 
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; The masked woman carried a rose in her other 
hand, and had a gentle smile.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Dita sighed, taking her hand. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked 
quietly.

&quot;I am the Masked Maiden,&quot; she said dramatically, &quot;Pollylina!&quot;

Dita sweatdropped a bit, but still smiled. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said 
softly. Quietly, &quot;Does this sort of thing happen around here often?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Pollylina shrugged. Her eyes grew wide, &quot;Oh goddess, she&#39;s 
here.&quot; She turned to flee, saying over her shoulder, &quot;It was nice to 
meet you!&quot;

She was gone, then a pretty blonde arrive. &quot;Pollylina,&quot; she yelled, 
waving her arms, &quot;it&#39;s me, Yuna, your biggest fan!&quot; Yuna ran after the 
rapidly fleeing woman.

Not far away, Anthy knelt down behind a bush by Akane. &quot;Are you sure 
this is a good idea?&quot; Anthy asked her worriedly.

Utena ran by, Akane popped up and hit Lum with a giant mallet!

&quot;Only way you can get her attention,&quot; Akane said with some 
satisfaction.

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Anthy hugged her happily, &quot;I was so worried!&quot; Her eyes 
suddenly glittered dangerously, &quot;What was that I heard about your 
hugging Kozue?&quot;

&quot;It was just a friendly hug, I swear,&quot; Utena protested.

&quot;I&#39;ll take her back to Kozue,&quot; Akane smiled, hefting the tiger 
stripped bikini garbed girl over her shoulder and walking off.

&quot;Well, never mind,&quot; Anthy suddenly became business like, &quot;you&#39;ve got a 
duel to fight.&quot; She whistled, and the Wing Zero Custom dropped out of 
the sky.

&quot;Where to?&quot; Heero&#39;s voice came over the speakers.

&quot;The dueling Arena,&quot; Anthy yelled, leading a stunned Utena up onto the 
giant robot&#39;s hand, &quot;and don&#39;t clip any buildings this time!&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Heero yelled back, and they were off.

A few moments later, and Anthy was tidying her rose bride dress up on 
the edge of the dueling platform. &quot;Well, I guess we didn&#39;t need the 
science building, anyway,&quot; she muttered.

The other duelist finished the walk up the stairs, stepping through 
the arch and looking around curiously. &quot;Why don&#39;t they put in an 
elevator, anyway?&quot; Angela asked curiously, Haruka following right 
behind her.

&quot;You&#39;re not a rose duelist,&quot; Utena looked at the android in surprise.

&quot;I beat up Saionji and took his ring,&quot; Angela shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ll give it 
back once we&#39;re done,&quot; she explained cheerfully.

Utena sweatdropped, even as Anthy put a rose in her pocket, then put 
another in Angela&#39;s pocket. &quot;So why?&quot; Utena started.

&quot;To see if you&#39;re as good as they say,&quot; Angela smiled, drawing her 
sword.

Utena quickly drew the sword of Dios, and they charged!

About twenty minutes later, and Haruka and Anthy were drinking tea, 
watching the fight go on. &quot;Does this sort of thing happen to Utena 
often?&quot;

&quot;Sadly, yes,&quot; Anthy sighed. From under her skirt she produced several 
manga. At Haruka&#39;s curious look she passed one over, &quot;Megatokyo is 
pretty good.&quot;

&quot;Neat,&quot; Haruka happily began to read.

Utena was wheezing softly, swaying a bit as she faced the cool 
android. &quot;You.. want.. to.. give.. up?&quot; she managed to get out.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Angela admitted, smoothly sheathing her sword. &quot;I can 
wear you down, but other than that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to beat 
you,&quot; she said admiringly.

Utena sighed softly in relief, then promptly keeled over.

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Anthy cried out in alarm, shaking her worriedly.

&quot;Is she dead,&quot; Haruka asked worriedly.

&quot;No, I just wish I was,&quot; Utena whimpered.
