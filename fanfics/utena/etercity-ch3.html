<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 3 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/etercity-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The young woman stumbled out onto the balcony, belting the white robe 
around her waist as she yawned. Her reddish brown hair fell messily 
into her eyes as she looked out at the crazy quilt of different 
buildings that made up Crystal Tokyo. The tower that she stood in was 
a holdover from when this place had been called Tokyo-3, an outpost of 
a long ago war.

Kinomoto Sakura took a deep breath, savoring the taste of the sea air 
carried from the waters not so far away from them. Her lover was 
asleep in the bed just behind her, and Sakura was content to just let 
her sleep. Today was a difficult anniversary for them both, and for 
now Sakura wanted to be alone, and remember.

It had been a summer&#39;s day like this one, but their hearts had been 
heavy. The grave sat on the hill, the script almost unbearable for 
them to read, the earth freshly turned up. &#39;Kinomoto Toya,&#39; it read, 
then the two dates, &#39;1980-2050.&#39;

Yukito stumbled forward, there was a flash of blue light and the sweep 
of mighty wings, and Yue fell to his knees in front of the grave. &quot;Oh, 
Toya,&quot; Yue murmured softly, &quot;how could you have left me so very soon?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Sakura said softly. &#39;It isn&#39;t fair,&#39; she thought, &#39;my 
magic stopped me aging at twenty-five. Why couldn&#39;t it save Toya from 
his cancer?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that the doctors did everything they could,&quot; the over sixty 
years old Tomoyo Daidouji said to him sadly.

Tears slowly began to trickle down Yue&#39;s face as he said, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know what I&#39;ll do without him. He was my life, my heart.&quot;

Toya and Yukito had been living together for years, almost as soon as 
they graduated from school. Despite whatever life threw at them, they 
remained the perfect couple. Sakura had thought that nothing would 
ever split them apart, but she had been wrong.

Kero&#39;s voice was quiet, &quot;You have to carry on, for his sake.&quot;

Yue&#39;s hawk&#39;s eyes met Kero&#39;s gaze, &quot;I&#39;ve lived so very long, 
Keroberos, and all things must end eventually.&quot; He looked up at 
Tomoyo, &quot;Come here, please.&quot;

Tomoyo took Yue&#39;s hand gently, &quot;Let me help you up.&quot;

&quot;Do you love Sakura,&quot; Yue looked up to ask her, &quot;with all of your 
heart?&quot;

&quot;Yes, always,&quot; Tomoyo blinked in surprise.

&quot;Good,&quot; a smiling Yue murmured, while keeping a firm grip on Tomoyo&#39;s 
hand. His body glowed a soft blue, slowly becoming brighter until it 
flared brightly, then the wings seemed to shatter into a cloud of 
feathers. They swirled about Tomoyo&#39;s body, the light building all 
around her, and with another flash she stood transformed.

The wings stretched from Tomoyo&#39;s back now, and she carried with her 
an aura of power, this beautiful twenty-five year old woman. Her long 
black hair flowed free from age, her body restored to all of it&#39;s 
vigor of youth. Her eyes, though, remained the same, shining with love 
as she looked adoringly at Sakura. &quot;Yue,&quot; she gasped, and turned to 
look at him worriedly.

Yukito lay there, leaning up against the stone. He looked much older 
than he should have, like he was a hundred years old, not seventy. His 
blue eyes were closed, looking almost as if he had simply fallen 
asleep there.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Sakura murmured, kneeling down beside him. She felt the side 
of his neck, but she knew as soon as she touched him that he was gone.

Sakura pulled her robe around her, feeling a chill. &#39;We lost both of 
them that day, Toya and Yue,&#39; she thought to herself sadly. A warm 
hand rested on her shoulder, and she turned around to meet Tomoyo&#39;s 
caring gaze.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Tomoyo asked. The dark haired woman looked 
completely normal, having learned to hide her other nature over the 
years they had been together.

&quot;A little sad,&quot; Sakura said quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right to miss them,&quot; Tomoyo slid her arm across Sakura&#39;s 
shoulders, &quot;but you should also try to remember all the good things.&quot; 
An impish smile, &quot;Remember how Toya used to call you a little monster? 
And poor Li&#39;s crush on Yukito?&quot;

Sakura had to smile, &quot;That was pretty funny.&quot;

They walked inside together, standing close. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to 
the meeting up at the Palace,&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;It&#39;ll be nice to see all of our old friends once again,&quot; Sakura 
admitted. She blushed faintly, &quot;Do you want to visit the Locket, while 
we&#39;re in town?&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket?&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed. She blinked, looking honestly 
surprised, &quot;It&#39;s actually still open, even after all these years?&quot;

&quot;I did some checking,&quot; Sakura beamed, &quot;and it&#39;s still around. I&#39;m not 
sure who&#39;s on the staff, anymore, but it could be fun.&quot;

A sleepy, and clearly only just awakened Kero flew in. &quot;Is this the 
bar that I couldn&#39;t get in to one time?&quot; he asked them pointedly.

Tomoyo looked at the little flying toy lion with wings, &quot;Well, I could 
put a skirt on you, a bit of makeup. The bar has let a few 
crossdressers in before.&quot;

Kero puffed up, &quot;No way you&#39;re pouting me in a skirt!&quot;

&quot;Then I guess you can&#39;t go,&quot; Sakura grinned. She noticed Kero looked a 
bit disappointed, so she added, &quot;We&#39;ll get you some cake for when 
we&#39;re gone.&quot;

&quot;Cake? Yes!&quot; Kero perked up almost immediately.

&quot;Simple mind, simple pleasures,&quot; Tomoyo murmured to Sakura, who had to 
fight to keep from laughing aloud.

The two got dressed, and headed out with Kero to pick him up some 
cake. The lift brought them down to street level, and they smoothly 
moved into the bustling foot traffic. &quot;I kind of missed this, when we 
were living on Mars,&quot; Sakura noted.

&quot;It was pretty boring,&quot; Kero admitted. A girl wandered by in a pink, 
ruffled catsuit and he pointed her out to Tomoyo, &quot;Wasn&#39;t that one of 
your designs?&quot;

Tomoyo nodded, &quot;It doesn&#39;t look as good on her as it did on Sakura, 
though.&quot; Tomoyo sighed dreamily, &quot;Then again, everything looks better 
on Sakura!&quot;

Sakura sweatdropped. Years back Tomoyo had released some of her 
designs commercially, and they had just taken off! Even now, girls 
were wearing outfits inspired by Sakura&#39;s card capturing days. Even 
worse, she had used digitally captured images of Sakura herself in the 
ads.

&quot;Too embarrassing,&quot; Sakura murmured softly.

&quot;What?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; Sakura sighed. She pointed, &quot;There&#39;s a bakery.&quot;

&quot;Yeah! Cake,&quot; Kero almost danced in midair.

&quot;Then on to the Locket,&quot; Tomoyo smiled. She leaned in close to whisper 
in Tomoyo&#39;s ear, &quot;Maybe we can rent an upstairs room like we used to.&quot;

Sakura went beet red.
