<h1>Just One Summer (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/just1-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Normally it would have taken them two more days to arrive the little 
village between huge trees. A small street leaded towards it and most 
people there lived from the tourists looking at the near Fujiyama. But 
Utena didn&#39;t rush things. For another day they stayed at the small 
pond and instead of two days they needed five. Anthy wasn&#39;t as quick 
as the taller girl but after the first impatient moments Utena slowed 
down. She relaxed more and more as the days passed and decided 
silently that this was their vacations and that they didn&#39;t have to 
hurry up. Her aunt awaited them in some days and it wouldn&#39;t be tragic 
if Utena called her up and told her that they needed another week for 
the normal journey.

The small village had only few houses. A supermarket, a hotel with a 
delicious but expensive restaurant, some various houses that rented 
private rooms and a doctor. The hospital, maybe the tiniest one of 
whole Japan, had never serious patients. Mostly some tourists who 
forgot their sun block and got a bad sunburn. Or in the winter some 
broken arms or legs when the tourists overestimated their skills on 
skis. There was a small market place with a fountain in the middle. 
Utena run towards it and held her head under the ray of crystal clear 
water. She let out a small scream and grinned at Anthy who moved a 
little bit slower. &quot;That was refreshing!&quot; Wet pink hairs fell over now 
wet shoulders and blue eyes sparkled. Anthy smiled shyly back and let 
Chuchu sat on the fountain&#39;s rim. She helped her little pet to drink 
and splashed a little bit fresh water into her hot face. 

&quot;Hai, it is, Tenjoh-san.&quot; The stick Utena carved in during the last 
evenings, leaned against the stones. Utena gave it to the smaller girl 
who couldn&#39;t walk so well with her left feet. She burned it that night 
when she searched for a ghost. A really, really stupid ghost. But the 
burn hadn&#39;t been very dangerous and it healed good with the ointment 
Utena gave her.

&quot;What do we need?&quot; Utena reached into her pocket and produced a 
crumbled sheet of paper. She frowned as she read the word she wrote 
down for several times.

&quot;Chocolate bars?&quot; she giggled guilty. &quot;Is that all?&quot;

&quot;Hm... chocolate bars and toast. New water bottles, cheese, salami and 
new batteries for the torches.&quot; Suddenly Anthy held herself a sheet in 
her hands. It was longer than Utena&#39;s. &quot;Maybe we are lucky and they 
have some already boiled eggs.&quot; Shortly she glanced at a confused 
looking Utena and smiled softly at her.

She looks like a little child.

Anthy giggled and her eyes focused again on her writing.

Sometimes she behaves like one.

&quot;Oh, and the tomato soup is out.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all on your little sheet?&quot; asked Utena disbelieving and looked 
over Anthy&#39;s shoulder. Then she stared at her rucksack which got 
lighter during the past days. But she didn&#39;t notice it. All she 
noticed was that Chuchu ate her last chocolate bar. A real tragedy. 
Utena chased the little pet through the whole forest until he hide 
behind Anthy&#39;s back. Showing Utena his little tongue because he knew 
that he was secure with the bronze girl.

&quot;You are a real darling!&quot; The pink haired girl suddenly grabbed 
Anthy&#39;s hands and swirled her around. &quot;What would I do without you?&quot;

Not duelling the whole school term.

Not being hurt by Saionji or Toga.

Not being screamed at by Juri.

Anthy blinked and her purple eyes darkened.

Not being punished with a burden like me.

&quot;I would starve without you, little one.&quot; Utena who didn&#39;t see the 
change in Anthy&#39;s face laughed loud. Then she put her rucksack back on 
her back and grabbed the smaller girl&#39;s hand again. To pull her 
towards the little supermarket. Chuchu jumped on Anthy&#39;s shoulder and 
complained that they almost forgot him.

&quot;You ate my last chocolate bar, don&#39;t grouse!&quot; growled Utena and they 
both stared angrily at each other. It was their private fight and 
Anthy knew that she couldn&#39;t do anything against it. They both were 
like little children sometimes and she knew that they would stop it 
when they got bored. So she looked around in the little shop they just 
entered. It had some shelves in the middle and bar for meat and one 
for cheese. The milk in the bottles was fresh, maybe even from the 
villager&#39;s cows. 

Hope it&#39;s not so expensive.

Anthy would like to drink something of that milk. But she had hardly 
any money. Of course she got pocket money and while she was Saionji&#39;s 
Rose Bride he gave her sometimes a little bit to buy nice clothes or 
simply to be out of the way when he had a date or wanted to practice 
with his sword. She never knew what to buy and so she saved it. 
Nevertheless it was too less to finance a camping trip. The clothes 
she wore were Utena&#39;s, they used her tent and her equipment and Utena 
said that her aunt wouldn&#39;t let them starve. She had a small 
restaurant herself and when they helped a little bit, they would get 
the best okonomiyaki&#39;s she could find in whole Japan.

&quot;I have never seen something as greedy as you!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;It was MY bar!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;Oh, shut up!&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot;

Anthy giggled and reached for an iron shopping bag. But an older woman 
was quicker. She pushed her aside and took the bag first. Then she 
looked around to see who was in her way and looked arrogant down at 
the bronze girl. Her eyes glanced over to Utena who still stared with 
anger at the brown something sitting on the smaller girl&#39;s shoulder. 
For a moment the tourist stared at their hands, still holding each 
other tight. Her mouth formed to a line, then she turned around 
without a greeting and went away.

Nani?

Anthy frowned, but had no time to think over the older woman&#39;s strange 
behaviour as Utena decided to go on shopping. Chuchu had turned his 
back to her and sulked. That was boring and they had not the whole 
time to waste. She wanted to leave the small village soon. To reach 
the lake. To use her fishing rod again. And maybe, when she was lucky, 
to catch the first carp this summer.

I let Anthy decide how far she wants to go today.

Without letting the warm hand go she walked determinedly through the 
shelves. Pulling a silent Anthy with her. Just then a real tragedy 
happened. It was almost as bad as the earthquake two years ago that 
let her famous apple tree fall over and that destroyed her bike. 
Almost. This tragedy was worse. Much worse. It was the worst thing 
that could have happened to her right now.

&quot;No!&quot;

Utena let go of Anthy&#39;s hand and went on her knees before the shelve. 
Raising her hands towards the ceiling as if she blamed the gods.

&quot;No chocolate bar!&quot; she stared in disbelieve at the empty shelve and 
her big blue eyes watered. &quot;That&#39;s unfair! That&#39;s unbelievable! That&#39;s 
big injustice!&quot;

Anthy looked shortly around but no one seemed to have noticed the big 
drama. Then she knelt down besides her friend and leaned forward. Out 
of the nothing she produced one single chocolate bar. The last one. 
With nuts in it. And caramel. And a little bit nougat.

&quot;It&#39;s the last one.&quot; Smiled Anthy and blushed deeply as Utena embraced 
her suddenly and grabbed greedily for that bar.

&quot;You are my saving angel, Anthy!&quot; Utena held the bar tight and watched 
it, before she put it carefully into the bag. &quot;That&#39;s my bar, Chuchu. 
If you eat it, you have to walk alone back to school! Did you 
understand me?&quot; she said warning to the brown pet who kept showing her 
his back. 

&quot;Okay, what else?&quot; Utena raised the shopping bag carefully and they 
continued their shopping. The things they needed went into the iron 
bag. Only tomato soup was missing. The new one would arrive next week, 
together with new chocolate bars. Utena and Anthy agreed that they 
wouldn&#39;t wait and went over to the counter to pay. Anthy was relieved 
when Utena paid while she declared laughing that she was the one 
eating the most of all this stuff. While they put the new bought 
things into the rucksacks - the heavy things in Utena&#39;s and the 
lighter things into Anthy&#39;s - the bronze girl discovered a bottle of 
milk. It was cold and surely very fresh. Surprised she raised her 
eyebrows.

&quot;Milk? I thought you don&#39;t like milk without cocoa. We don&#39;t have 
one.&quot; She asked and ignored the older woman who just left the shop. 
She whispered something Anthy couldn&#39;t understand. But it sounded not 
very nice.

Some people are strange.

&quot;This milk is special. It&#39;s fresh from the cows here.&quot; Smiled Utena 
and almost fell over as she lifted her now heavy rucksack again. 
Chuchu laughed and the pink haired girl made a face. They both showed 
each other their tongues.

You stood before the shelf and looked so longing at it. Of course I 
don&#39;t like pure milk, but you do, Anthy.

Utena grabbed again for the smaller hand that felt so right in her own 
one and pulled the smaller girl out of the shop after she greeted the 
young assistance who only grinned.

&quot;It&#39;s this way to go to the lake.&quot; Utena opened the map while they 
walked along the small road bending through the village. Normally 
Utena didn&#39;t need the map who looked old and crumbled. She knew the 
way. Only Anthy didn&#39;t know. To show her which distance she meant, she 
showed it to her on the map before they started to walk. That Anthy 
had the chance to protest. Of course the violet haired girl never did, 
but the expression on her face couldn&#39;t lie. It showed Utena often 
when her plan for the next day was too exaggerated.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look so far away.&quot; Anthy corrected her glasses and felt 
how Chuchu moved on her shoulder. To look at the coloured paper as 
well. The idea of taking a refreshing bath in the lake was tempting 
and Anthy knew that it would be the last effort for the next days. 
Utena talked a lot about the fishes and that she wanted to stay there 
for a while. To be lazy, to catch and roast fishes and to drown Chuchu 
if he would steal any more of her suppers. Of course Anthy knew that 
Utena didn&#39;t mean it, but to see the two arguing was simply funny.

&quot;I needed mostly two hours for that way.&quot; Utena looked asking over to 
the smaller girl. &quot;That means about four hours when we slow down a 
little bit.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fine.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure? Doesn&#39;t your left foot hurt, Anthy?&quot;

Anthy gave her one of those soft smiles and shook her head.

&quot;My feet only wants to see nice water.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s still the fountain!&quot;

Utena tried to pull her around but Anthy only giggled and showed the 
taller girl her stick.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, with that magic stick I can achieve everything.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you think so... but say when you want to stop, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

Utena nodded satisfied and put the map away. She forgot the fountain 
and even her friend as she saw the next shop. The window that showed 
one of the most delicious food mankind ever invented. Next to 
chocolate bars, of course.

&quot;There&#39;s ice cream!&quot; she shouted excitedly and Anthy almost fell down 
as Utena started to run. Very, very fast. Her blue eyes sparkled 
greedily and the next moment she stood right next to the window. 
Looking down at all the different sorts. Remembering how delicious 
they tasted. And how big the portions were. Suddenly she remembered 
how her father once bought her her very first ice cream. Chocolate ice 
cream of course.

&quot;What do you want, Anthy?&quot;

Utena smiled friendly at the young man who sold the cold food. He 
didn&#39;t look older than she. Maybe he was still a pupil or a student at 
a university and tried to get some extra money with that job. Or the 
restaurant belonged to his family and it was his duty to help during 
the summer.

&quot;What does taste?&quot; Anthy felt unsure as the young man smiled at her, 
too, and waited patiently for them to decide. He already held one 
waffle in his hand.

&quot;Well... everything.&quot; Utena pulled her money out and counted some 
coins. &quot;You can take two portions, Anthy, I still can afford it. 
Because they had no chocolate bars.&quot; Shortly her face darkened but it 
brightened up as she allowed herself two big portions of chocolate ice 
cream. There was no better substitute for the bars than this ice 
cream.

Delicious!

&quot;Hm...&quot; Anthy looked still unsure.

I can&#39;t tell her that I never had ice cream before in my life. She 
would laugh about me.

The bronze girl gulped and finally pointed at two sorts that looked 
nice. White and yellow, that couldn&#39;t be poisonous, could it?

No one went ice eating with her at school. The other duellists simply 
didn&#39;t have time or didn&#39;t want her to be around. Especially Toga who 
wanted to be alone with his dates. With all those girls. Chuchu was 
Anthy&#39;s only friend and she didn&#39;t dare to go on her own in the near 
city. Too often Nanami and her girls waited there for her to shout at 
her. Besides she had no money to afford it.

&quot;Here you are, young lady.&quot; The young man smirked at her and handled 
her the waffle. Anthy bowed and looked sceptically at the white and 
yellow mass. Then she took a deep breath and ate a little bit of it 
bravely. Surprised she stared at it before she continued eating. It 
was really as delicious as Utena had said.

&quot;Have a nice day, ladies.&quot;

&quot;Arigato. Have a nice day, too.&quot; Utena winked at the young man who 
blushed before they went ahead. Towards the end of the village. To go 
again into the forest and to follow the small path to the big lake.

&quot;Lemon and banana. A good choice, Anthy.&quot; The pink haired girl smiled 
with her brown mouth at the smaller one and sighed relieved as they 
went from the burning sun into the nice shadows of the trees. &quot;Do you 
wanna try my chocolate ice? It&#39;s damn delicious.&quot; Utena giggled as 
Anthy took her waffle hesitantly and gave her her own one in return. 
Soon the bronze girl&#39;s mouth was brown, too. Just like Chuchu&#39;s who 
begged as long as Anthy gave him a little bit.

&quot;Guess I am addicted to chocolate.&quot; Declared Utena to the world in 
general. &quot;Chocolate ice cream, chocolate bars. Guess if that would be 
possible, I would beg my aunt to make me chocolate okonomiyaki.&quot; 

&quot;Does that taste, Tenjoh-san?&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice was too innocent to make 
a joke.

&quot;I have no idea.&quot; They exchanged the waffles and suddenly Chuchu sat 
on Utena&#39;s shoulder. It seemed as if he was chocolate addicted, too. 
&quot;My aunt always threats to throw a frying pane at me if I don&#39;t shut 
up and eat my mushroom okonomiyaki.&quot;

They both giggled and went on. Talking about different things while 
eating their ice creams. Both girls smiled while a little pet looked 
more and more desperate because Utena ignored him determinedly. Until 
the end when the pink haired girl showed mercy and gave him the rest 
of her waffle.

***

&quot;Give the water three more minutes to burn.&quot; Utena looked into the 
rucksack, but decided to save the only chocolate bar she owned right 
now for a special moment. Or at least for the moment she couldn&#39;t live 
any longer without having eaten it.

The sun was setting when they finally arrived the lake. Now the water 
sparkled in the moon&#39;s shine and it looked mysteriously. A sickle on a 
cloudless sky. Between sparkling stars. It had taken them even five 
hours to get here. In the middle of their journey Utena wanted to stop 
and to set the tent, but Anthy insisted to go on. She wanted to reach 
the lake and was very determined. The same determined she was now 
tired. The bronze girl sat on the rim of the lake and let her feet 
hanging into the fresh water. She had closed her eyes and her right 
hand tried to massage her left shoulder. 

Surely she has aching muscles.

It had been Utena who sat the tent, made the fire and cared for their 
supper. Anthy only sat down when they arrived and didn&#39;t move again. 
The rucksack laid untouched next to her and she looked really 
exhausted.

It was too much for her and her foot.

&quot;The next days no more walking, okay?&quot; whispered the pink haired girl 
and knelt down behind her friend. Anthy only nodded, slightly moving 
her feet.

&quot;Is supper ready?&quot;

&quot;Three more minutes for the water, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

The smaller girl&#39;s voice was sleepy and Utena knew that Anthy would 
sleep very well this night. And deep. That not even a bomb exploding 
right by her side would wake her up during the next ten hours. At 
least. Utena leaned over to the big rucksack and searched in it until 
she found the sun block. They had a big bottle that would hold the 
next weeks. Because the sun was burning without mercy and they would 
get a bad sunburn if they didn&#39;t take it in the morning and refresh it 
at noon. Once Utena forgot her nose and looked for two days like a 
circus clown. Not even Anthy&#39;s bronze skin was safe. The first days 
they didn&#39;t think that their ears were necessary to get creamed up, 
but as Anthy&#39;s ears changed from bronze into red bronze they decided 
that every little bit skin that wasn&#39;t covered with clothes had to be 
covered with sun block.

&quot;Open your shirt, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s voice was sleepy but she did as she was told. All those years 
as Rose Bride left her traces. Whatever Utena wanted Anthy to do, the 
smaller girl did it without hesitation. Mostly. Only when it was too 
senseless she asked before she did it. Just like the Sunday when Utena 
had the crazy idea of making a pullover for Wakaba. To her birthday. 
Of course Utena had no idea how to knit. Nor what to use for knitting. 
Nor how big the different parts should have been. Of course Utena 
wanted Anthy to be her model. To stand the whole day silently so that 
she could put the different parts she finished on her until she could 
stitch them all together. First Anthy agreed but when she saw that 
Utena needed five hours alone for the neck, she doubted that they 
would do it in one day. When the evening came she protested to wear 
the pieces that looked really terrible, because there were big holes 
in the cloth, the whole night and the whole next week. Utena got 
impatient and threw all the pieces she got so far away and bought 
Wakaba a ready pullover. Much to Anthy&#39;s relief.

Utena pulled the green shirt with the sunflower on the back over 
Anthy&#39;s shoulder and covered the brown skin with sun block. Anthy 
shivered but still didn&#39;t react.

The past days she got more open and protested. Silently, but she 
actually protested when Utena did another nonsense. Just like the big 
tree she wanted to climb at just three days ago. To get a con. Anthy 
shook terrified her head and declared with her calm voice that she 
shouldn&#39;t do that. That it was dangerous. That Anthy would show her 
aunt every single photo she made if she really did that nonsense. 
Utena placed her hands on the smaller girl&#39;s skin and started gently 
to massage the shoulders. Anthy made a sound that was surprised but 
the same time agreeing. She lowered her head a little bit and relaxed 
under Utena&#39;s soft touches. Soft, almost tender. Slowly Utena relaxed 
all the hurting muscles and massaged a little bit longer than 
necessary.

There was again that soft smile on Anthy&#39;s lips. The soft smile Utena 
could watch for hours. So relaxed, so happy she looked suddenly like 
someone else. Not like the girl who had to be a Rose Bride, who was 
forbidden to have her own will. Her own thoughts. Not like the girl 
who did whatever her so called groom wanted her to do. Now she looked 
free with a sudden. Like a girl who made jokes and giggled whenever 
Utena made a confused face. Like a girl who was concerned about her 
and held her tight as she was sad about her parent&#39;s death. Like a 
girl who could tease her around and be really happy. Out of the depths 
of her heart.

She is beautiful.

The moon shone on a relaxed face and its reflection of the water 
covered the place around in a silver shine. The hairdo was messed and 
some violet strands fell over Anthy&#39;s ears. They curled slightly up. 
Touched a bronze cheek.

Doesn&#39;t anyone see how beautiful she is? That she is a real princess?

Utena stopped to massage and swallowed as Anthy leaned trustfully 
against her chest. Her hands rested in her lap and her feet stopped to 
move in the lake&#39;s water.

No, they don&#39;t. But you do.

Utena frowned and ignored the little voice in her head. Instead she 
raised her right hand and stoke away those strands. Caressed tenderly 
over the bronze cheek, felt the soft skin under her finger tips. 
Anthy&#39;s breathing became more and more regularly and Utena needed some 
moments to realize that the smaller girl was fast asleep.

Isn&#39;t she hungry?

The pink haired girl caressed again the cheek although there was no 
strand left to wipe away. She knew that their supper waited for them 
but somehow she couldn&#39;t wake Anthy up. She looked so peaceful she had 
never seen her before. No desperate expression when Utena argued with 
one of the duellists and declared loudly that she didn&#39;t believe in 
that strange revolution they were all talking about. No more fear in 
purple eyes whenever Utena fought in a duel and it wasn&#39;t sure if she 
would win it. If Anthy could stay with her or if she had to go to 
someone else. Still the smile laid on the bronze face and Anthy looked 
happy. Really happy. And loved...

&quot;Utena...&quot;

The pink haired girl froze as she heard the calm voice whispering her 
name. No, not the formal one Anthy chose by the day they got to know 
each other. But by her real name. Her Christian name. A smaller hand 
grabbed for her one caressing the bronze skin and held it tight. With 
the weak power only a sleeping person had. But the power was too 
strong for Utena to let go. So the pink haired girl knelt there for a 
long she couldn&#39;t define. Staring into Anthy&#39;s relaxed face and at the 
hand that held her own one. On a thin belly that moved slightly with 
every regular breath.

Nani?

She just called me Utena, not Tenjoh-san.

Suddenly tears burned in blue eyes. Utena blinked and didn&#39;t know 
where they came from.

Does she accept my friendship now? Does she finally see that she can 
trust me? That I won&#39;t treat her the bad way the others had done? Are 
we really friends now?

Utena felt how her throat tightened and blinked again.

Does she stay now? Voluntarily? Doesn&#39;t she go away like my parents, 
like Kei and like Wakaba? Just like 

Ayani?

Utena took a shaking breath before she embraced Anthy carefully. 
Softly she brought the deep sleeping girl nearer to her body and held 
her tight. Buried her burning face in violet hairs. Just stay, Anthy. 
Please...

Chuchu sat on top of Utena&#39;s rucksack and nibbled on a biscuit while 
the flames of the fire died slowly away.

***

The fishing rod swirled through the air before the hook went with an 
elegant dive into the water.

&quot;I needed four years to learn that.&quot; Explained Utena and pushed the 
rod into the stony ground. She wasn&#39;t patient enough to sit the whole 
time and to wait for a fish to bit into the bait. She simply would let 
it that way and look after it in some hours. The water looked to nice 
to let it get used. The lake was big enough to find a place to swim 
without scaring away all fishes.

&quot;The first time I tried to use the rod I almost knocked Kei 
unconscious.&quot; She grinned at Anthy who watched her interested. First 
Utena wanted her to throw it but the smaller girl only shook her head 
and stepped back. Telling Utena that this was her business.

&quot;Although Kei was a baka. He stood right behind me!&quot;

Anthy giggled because if anyone would have stood behind Utena this 
time, she would still beat that person down. Chuchu on her shoulder 
played with his ear ring and looked interested around. He liked this 
place very much. In the morning when Anthy awoke he hadn&#39;t been next 
to her on the pillow and she searched him in fears. Until she found 
him laying on a big leaf of water roses which swam on the surface. 
Only some inches away from the rim. He looked so cute, she simply had 
to take a photo of him. The same she had to take a photo when Utena 
finally crept out of their tent. Her hairs stood in all directions and 
she looked very, very sleepy. She didn&#39;t even make the attempt to take 
away the camera. Instead she sat down at the water and needed almost 
an hour to eat one single roll. It took her eternity to wake up this 
morning but now she almost exploded because of energy.

&quot;Let&#39;s take a bath, Anthy!&quot; she shouted excitedly and grabbed the 
smaller girl&#39;s hand to pull her towards the water. It looked really 
nice: Crystal clear and slightly blue. Just like it always was on the 
postcards or the books she saw in the school&#39;s library. And it was 
very deep.

&quot;No...&quot; Anthy stiffed as she felt the water around her feet. Only two 
more steps and she would disappear into the fresh water. There was no 
big beach and only some inches away from the rim it was so deep that 
she couldn&#39;t stand any longer.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Utena stopped and turned around. The water already covered her 
body up to her chest. She decided this morning only to wear her pink 
bikini, because it was too hot. Why to waste a shirt when all she 
would do today was to swim around and take a sun bath? As long as they 
had enough sun block and as long as there were some more pages to read 
of her book she saw now reason why to behave civilised.

&quot;The pond wasn&#39;t so deep.&quot; Stammered Anthy and felt how she blushed. 
She still wore her glasses and could see the confused expression on 
Utena&#39;s face as she looked up to her.

What&#39;s wrong?

&quot;Hai, but it&#39;s calm. There aren&#39;t any waves and believe me, here are 
no monsters.&quot; Utena grinned and pulled the smaller girl a little bit 
more so that Anthy stood now in the water up to her waist. Still she 
fought against Utena, but the taller girl was stronger. She had no 
chance. &quot;The only monster here is me. So be aware, Anthy.&quot; With a 
final pull they both landed in the water. Anthy screamed but the water 
took her breath as she dove into the into it. She rowed with her arms 
as she came back to the surface and gasped hard for breath. Her legs 
searched automatically for hold but she found none. Panic filled her 
mind and she forgot how to swim with a sudden. How to move her arms 
and legs to keep over the surface. She tried to shout for help but 
instead she dove again. Gulping more and more water. Fearing to drown.

The next moment two arms took hers and someone helped her to appear 
again. She took a deep breath and coughed long and hard.

&quot;Anthy...&quot; Utena held the trembling girl tighter and swam together 
with her back to the rim. There she sat Anthy on a warm stone and 
waited until she stopped to cough.

&quot;Hey, Anthy, what&#39;s up? Everything alright? Did you get a cramp?&quot; 
Utena had often heard that even skilled swimmers could drown when they 
got a cramp in their legs. &quot;Or was the water too cold? Did you get a 
shock?&quot; Suddenly Utena felt guilty. They spent the whole morning in 
the burning sun. Her aunt often told her not to jump into the fresh 
water when her body was heated up. Of course Utena never heard of her 
aunt and now she feared that Anthy got such a dangerous shock.

&quot;No...&quot; Anthy wiped her wet hairs out of her pale face and took 
another deep breath. As if she was afraid that the air would be gone 
within the next moment. &quot;I am fine.&quot; She raised her head and her 
purple eyes were a shade darker than normal. &quot;I just can&#39;t swim.&quot;

&quot;Nani?&quot; Utena raised her eyebrows in astonishment. &quot;But the pond... I 
saw you swimming and...&quot;

&quot;I... I learned it, but not really. I know how to move, but I always 
touch the ground with at least one leg and... and there was suddenly 
no ground...&quot; admitted Anthy and glanced again over to the lake. &quot;The 
water is nice and I like it to be at the rim, but I...&quot; she shook her 
head. &quot;I am afraid of drowning in the middle. When there&#39;s no ground 
under my feet.&quot;

Utena took Anthy&#39;s now icy hands and without thinking she stroke over 
soft palms.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that, Anthy.&quot; Said Utena quietly and followed Anthy&#39;s 
eyes looking outside the lake. Unsure and afraid. And longing. &quot;But 
don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll learn it.&quot; Suddenly Utena rose and pulled Anthy 
again with her. She remembered too well how her father learned her how 
to swim and that it hadn&#39;t been that hard. Her father told her again 
and again that she could do it, that she was perfect, that everything 
was possible if she only wanted it. Her told it to her so often that 
she believed in his words. That she believed in herself. From that 
moment on swimming had been easy for her.

Anthy only have to believe in herself. She can swim, I&#39;ve seen it.

&quot;No...&quot; whimpered the violet haired girl and wanted to go away. But 
Utena held her determinedly back, looked directly into purple eyes 
being wide with fear.

&quot;You can swim, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Just trust yourself.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s easy for you. You already learned it.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Trust me, Anthy. I would never let you drown.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

The bronze girl raised her head and gulped. Utena smiled friendly at 
her and the warm hands held her a little bit lighter. Utena didn&#39;t 
want to rush her, but Anthy knew that the taller girl wouldn&#39;t be 
satisfied until she wasn&#39;t in the water again. Utena could be very 
stubborn. Stubborn and impatient. Angry and childish. But never cruel. 
In all those months they knew each other now she never hurt Anthy. No, 
she protected her. She took her with her on vacation and cared for 
her. She even slowed down in her incredible hiking speed and let Anthy 
drink the whole bottle of the milk that tasted simply delicious.

No, she would never let me drown.

Anthy gulped and fear made her body shiver as she stepped deeper into 
the nice fresh water. Utena&#39;s smile got softer as they both slipped 
again into the big lake. Anthy gasped hard for breath as her legs lost 
the ground. Her mind wanted to panic again but the calming words of 
the taller girl held her back of splashing around like crazy. She 
forced herself to move her arms and legs the way she learned when she 
was little and suddenly it worked. Suddenly she swam. Just once she 
remembered that there was no ground under her feet and shouted for 
help. Right at that moment when Utena let go because she thought that 
Anthy was sure enough to swim on her own.

&quot;Everything alright, little one.&quot; She held the smaller girl again and 
smiled confident. &quot;I won&#39;t let you go again, okay?&quot;

Anthy only nodded and smiled bravely back. Then she took a deep breath 
and continued to move her arms and her legs. Continued to swim. To 
swim freely for the first time in her life.

As she promised, Utena held her the whole time.

***

&quot;I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again, cross the sea
I am sailing, stormy weather
To be near you, to be free.&quot;

Utena sang again with all her heart. A big carp roasted over the open 
fire. It smelled delicious and Utena&#39;s blue eyes shone greedily. She 
was more than happy to find the fish on the rod when they returned 
from their swimming. She ran around with the big, slippery fish in her 
hands and Anthy, still weak from the exhausting swimming, screamed out 
loud. First Utena didn&#39;t see that the smaller girl was afraid of the 
dead animal. Too proud about her big catch she placed the fish in 
Anthy&#39;s hands who screamed even more and let it fall. Then she ordered 
determined that Utena should take it back. That she would take some 
pictures of the proud fishing woman and that she liked to eat 
something of that big carp, too, but that she wouldn&#39;t touch it. So 
Utena went over to a stone and let Anthy photograph her in diverse 
poses. As if the carp was a dangerous shark and she the brave person 
who saved the whole world.

&quot;Chuchu!&quot;

Utena finished the song and looked warning at the animal. Big, brown 
eyes looked innocently up to her and the pet stepped slowly away from 
the rucksack.

&quot;Touch my chocolate bar and you&#39;ll have to starve for the rest of the 
journey.&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot;

Chuchu made a disappointed sound and turned around. Quickly he ran 
over to Anthy and jumped on her shoulder. To be petted behind his 
ears.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that you read love stories, Tenjoh-san.&quot; Anthy sat with 
crossed legs in the tent&#39;s entrance and held Utena&#39;s book in the air. 
The pink haired girl blushed as she saw the romantic cover of a young 
woman looking admiring up to a prince on a white horse.

&quot;Well...&quot; She blushed even deeper as Anthy opened the book and started 
to read. &quot;Just something to relax. I can&#39;t read Japanese literature 
the whole time, can I?&quot;

Anthy only nodded but didn&#39;t really listen to her any longer. She was 
already lost in the story of far away times. When a brave prince 
rescued the princess in need.

Utena grumbled some indefinable words and sighed deeply. Then she 
looked critically at the carp she turned over and over on a stick over 
the fire and decided that it was ready. That Anthy wouldn&#39;t read more 
of the romantic story and get a wrong picture of her. Or tease her 
around the whole evening.

&quot;Anthy? Supper is ready.&quot; Utena raised the carp and grinned. &quot;It 
already laughs, can&#39;t you see it? It wants to be eaten by you.&quot;

The bronze girl looked up and winced as she saw the roasted animal 
unexpectedly so near to her face. She put the book away and came 
giggling over to the fire.

&quot;It&#39;s really a moving story. Do you mean they will get each other in 
the end?&quot; she asked and thanked Utena as she got half of the fish and 
some toast on her plate. Chuchu begged in the instant and got a little 
bit of Anthy&#39;s food. Just to burn his little mouth and to beg for 
water desperately.

&quot;Of course they will. It&#39;s a story, they always get each in the end. 
Otherwise people wouldn&#39;t buy such books. Not when the ending would be 
sad.&quot;

&quot;Probably.&quot; Anthy shrugged her shoulders and continued to eat. It was 
really delicious although she didn&#39;t want to think of the slippery 
animal the taller girl took care of the whole evening. Carefully she 
pulled the fishbone away and had to giggle as Utena coughed. She was 
as impatient as ever and tried to gulp most of them.

&quot;Take care, Tenjoh-san. Better to eat once slowly than to choke.&quot;

Utena spat out a fishbone and nodded. And concentrated again on her 
fish. Trying desperately to ignore the growling of her stomach.

Tenjoh-san.

Slightly she sighed while she allowed herself another toast and wolfed 
it down to at least calm down her raging stomach a little bit.

She only called me Utena the last night. Because she had been asleep.

Nevertheless the pink haired girl didn&#39;t give up hope. Surely Anthy 
would forget that formal name soon. They had almost six more weeks 
left and six weeks were long. Very, very long.

Utena smiled happily by that thought of six more weeks of summer 
vacation and ate some more of her fish. Just to cough again. She loved 
fish. It was her most favourite food besides chocolate. But she was 
simply too impatient to eat it. Her aunt often gave up and gave her 
fish sticks instead. Where they had already removed every fishbone.

&quot;Here, Tenjoh-san.&quot; Anthy leaned forward and one moment later Utena 
held another plate in her hands. A plate where the fish was hardly 
eaten. But touched. Every big fishbone was missing.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Utena raised her head and looked over to Anthy who fought now 
with the other half of the fish. Removing the fish bones and giving 
some tiny parts to Chuchu who ate it with passion. Sitting on her 
right shoulder and purring luckily. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to give me your supper.&quot;

&quot;Of course I had to.&quot;

Nani?

Utena frowned because it was again the tone of voice Anthy used 
whenever she was the Rose Bride. Whenever she wore the red dress and 
had to watch her fighting another duel. Telling her again and again 
that she would do whatever Utena would tell her to do.

No, please, not again!

&quot;Otherwise you would have killed yourself and then we wouldn&#39;t have 
had fish tomorrow. I can&#39;t throw the rod, I can&#39;t kill the fish and I 
can&#39;t roast it. Chuchu would be very sad if he wouldn&#39;t get fish to 
eat tomorrow. He seems to like it.&quot; Anthy smiled one of her special, 
soft smiles and stroke gently over brown fur. Chuchu purred even more 
and leaned against her neck. Holding his big belly full with delicious 
supper.

Oh...

&quot;Arigato.&quot; Was all Utena could reply. Silently they ate the rest of 
their meals. Everyone thinking her personal thoughts. Anthy looked out 
of the lake, surely remembering the past afternoon when she learned 
how to swim freely, without fear. Utena herself looked over to Anthy 
and remembered the past night. When she held the smaller girls in her 
arms. When she felt strangely calm inside. Safe and secure. Suddenly 
all memories of her parents hadn&#39;t hurt any longer and all thoughts 
about the school and the duel disappeared. Her fears were gone. What 
would happen if she would lose one duel one day. When a opponent would 
appear who would be stronger than her. Or what would happen if she 
wouldn&#39;t lose a single duel. If she kept winning for the next months. 
Maybe even the next years. She didn&#39;t wonder any longer what would do 
after they finished school. Would she really revolutionise anything? 
Or would she simply leave school and go to university or start to work 
in her aunt&#39;s restaurant? Would Anthy then still be her friend? Would 
she still be there or would she be alone again?

All those doubts were suddenly gone. Disappeared into nowhere. When 
she held the smaller girl softly in her arms she had known that 
everything would be alright. That there was no reason to be afraid. 
That there would always be a next day, a next morning. That she would 
never be alone again. As long Anthy was by her side. No matter how 
strange that sounded, Utena suddenly knew that it was right this way.

It was very hard to let go finally when the sun was raising. She 
carried Anthy inside the tent and covered her with her sleeping bag. 
Watching the bronze girl until she finally felt asleep. Knowing that 
she would do everything in her might to stay Anthy&#39;s friend. No matter 
what the future held for them.

A deep thunder interrupted her thoughts. She saw how Anthy raised her 
head and looked over to the horizon. Clouds built up and got darker 
and darker. 

&quot;The last days had been too hot. Surely a thunderstorm is coming.&quot; 
Utena shrugged her shoulders and glanced at the chocolate bar in the 
depths of her rucksack. Silently she decided to keep it again for 
later and closed the rucksack. &quot;Better we take our things into the 
tent this night. It should deter the rain.&quot; 

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s answer was very silent and she winced as a big lightening 
crossed the dark sky.

***

She tried hard to sleep, but it was impossible. The thunder rolled 
above and rough wind ripped at the trees around. The little tent moved 
slightly and she feared that it would break down. Somewhere was the 
sound of water splashing against stones. And suddenly there seemed to 
be thousands of others noises. Noises that made her wince and shiver. 
Noises she didn&#39;t hear the last nights. Had they really been there and 
did she only ignore them? Because she slept so deep? Or were they new?

Anthy gulped and turned around in her sleeping bag. She sweated but 
didn&#39;t dare to put the blanket away. She knew that she would feel even 
weaker if she did. It was too dark to see inside the tent but Anthy 
could feel Utena lying next to her. Breathing regularly. Being 
obviously deep asleep. The thunderstorm didn&#39;t seem to worry her at 
all. She only complaint that they had less place with all their things 
in the tent and that her shoes didn&#39;t smell so nicely.

Somewhere was the steady breath of Chuchu. Somewhere next her feet. 
Anthy turned her head but couldn&#39;t see him. Not even feel him. 
Suddenly she felt left all alone. Another thunder crashed high above 
and she winced again madly. Normally she didn&#39;t behave like a small 
child. Normally she wasn&#39;t so afraid by a stupid thunderstorm. But 
here in the nature she felt weak. It was a complete different thing 
when she was inside four solid house walls, but the tent moved with 
every wind blow that went through the trees around them.

What shall I do?

She laid her head back on the pillow and stared with wide opened eyes 
at the ceiling of the tent she couldn&#39;t see. Because of the 
impenetrable darkness. Her glass were next to her, she only had to 
reach for them. But she knew that wouldn&#39;t see more with them.

Help!

But she didn&#39;t dare to say it aloud. Another thunder crashed and it 
seemed as if the lightening smashed somewhere near them. The bang was 
incredible loud and Anthy winced again. Automatically she kicked with 
her feet and something fell over. It sounded like one of their water 
bottles.

I wanna get out of here!

But she knew she couldn&#39;t. Outside was a heavy thunderstorm and there 
she wouldn&#39;t see anything more. She wanted to light one of their 
torches, but on the other hand she didn&#39;t want to wake Utena up.

Stop, please, stop!

But the weather didn&#39;t stop. Instead it got worse. Another lightning 
smashed somewhere near. Maybe in a tree. Then the rain started to 
fall. Hard drops drummed on the tent and it was incredible loud 
inside. The cover deformed under the sudden weight and Anthy hoped 
that it wouldn&#39;t break down the next moment. That the rain would 
remain outside.

What if a tree crashes on us?

What if the lake will be flooded and we will drown?

What if a lightening will hit us?

What...

Anthy rolled up to a ball on her sleeping bag and didn&#39;t even care 
that the blanket fell aside. For a moment the whole tent was 
illuminated and Anthy could see Utena sleeping next to her. On her 
back. She had spread her arms and looked peaceful. The bad weather 
didn&#39;t disturb her at all. Then darkness covered the tent again and 
the thunder that followed was deafening. It was as if the world was 
going to end. Anthy winced again badly and closed her eyes. Silently 
she whimpered and hoped that this night would be over soon. This damn, 
endless night.

&quot;Anthy?&quot; Utena&#39;s voice was full sleep and the taller girl yawned 
noisily. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

Anthy gulped and the desire to scream was irresistible as another 
lightening brightened up the tent for a second and was followed by 
another loud thunder. Those second was enough for Utena to see the 
frightened expression on the bronze face.

&quot;The thunder is always louder outside the cities.&quot; She whispered and 
yawned again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve seen many thunderstorms here. 
Tomorrow it will be over.&quot; Slightly she rolled over to her best friend 
and searched in the dark for a smaller hand. Before she could react 
she felt how Anthy had grabbed her whole arm and held it desperately 
tight.

&quot;Nothing will happen, Anthy.&quot; Utena covered the trembling girl with 
her blanket and closed her burning eyes. It was in the middle of the 
night and she was still very tired. One moment later she was fast 
asleep and Anthy could hear her regular breath near her. Could feel it 
on her cheeks. She couldn&#39;t see Utena but she could sense her. Right 
next to her. Like a rock in the surf. Suddenly the thunderstorm seemed 
to quieten and the rain didn&#39;t seem to be so important any longer. 
Anthy crept a little bit nearer to the warm body next to her and felt 
how Utena wrapped her free arm around her waist. How she held her 
protectively tight. Whispered sleepily some words 

Anthy couldn&#39;t understand. But she didn&#39;t have to. She knew that she 
was safe here. That nothing could happen to her. Not even in a 
thunderstorm like that one. Not even during such a long, long night.

Not as long as Utena was by her side.

Her prince who would always protect her against the evil world 
outside.

***

&quot;This would be the most perfect place for a castle.&quot;

Utena swung the fishing rod again and the bait dove into the clear 
water. The morning was a little bit fresher than the past day but the 
sky cleared quickly up. No traces were left by the heavy thunderstorm 
the last night. Only some puddles that would dry away soon.

&quot;A castle?&quot; Anthy didn&#39;t even open her eyes. Lazily she laid on a big 
towel next to Utena. They decided this morning to try another place 
for their carp trap. It was only ten minutes away from their tent and 
it was on a small cliff. Only some feet higher than their normal 
place. The cliff was stony and here they couldn&#39;t go into the water. 
But with a longer line it was a perfect place to fish. And to overlook 
the whole lake. It was really big and Anthy took several photos. 
Before she laid down on the towel and took a sun bath. She was very 
tired after she hardly slept the last night and after Utena left the 
tent early in the morning. To take a morning bath in the fresh water 
and of course to argue with Chuchu who tried again to steal the only 
chocolate bar they had. The angry words woke Anthy up and it was 
impossible for her to return to sleep again. Not inside a breeding 
warm tent. Without the soft body next to her.

&quot;Hai, a castle.&quot; Utena&#39;s blue eyes sparkled as she danced over the 
stony underground. She was barefoot and only wore her bikini. Slight 
wind played with her pink hairs as she spread her arms. &quot;This would be 
the kitchen. A big kitchen with a big fridge.&quot;

&quot;Full of chocolate bars?&quot; suggested Anthy and giggled yawning.

&quot;Of course! Right here will be the balcony. Overlooking the sea. Maybe 
it will be a little bit longer so that you can jump right into the 
water.&quot; Utena laughed and picked Chuchu up who made a protesting 
sound. &quot;You will have a little room for your own, you little beast.&quot; 
She sat him on her shoulder and climbed on the big rock. &quot;And there 
will be the horse stalls. I want a white horse. One, no, at least ten. 
They are beautiful creatures, Anthy. Of course we need a big hall to 
have big parties. Then I&#39;d invite Wakaba and my aunt. Oh, and of 
course we need many servants.&quot;

&quot;To tidy up your room?&quot;

&quot;Guess you know me now.&quot; Blushed Anthy and looked over to the wide 
lake with yearning in her eyes. &quot;I want to have a big tower. Very high 
so that I can oversee the whole forest when I am on top of it.&quot;

So that I am a little bit nearer to heaven.

&quot;A castle would be a nice idea. Right here, Anthy. Where it&#39;s so quiet 
and peaceful. Without the noises of the big city. Without cars. 
Without honks and all this industrial dirt. There&#39;ll be a big gate. 
Right there where our tents are right now, Anthy. I would only let the 
ones in who are nice. Toga and Saionji can stay outside until they 
learned to behave.&quot; Utena wrapped her arms around her body and made a 
face as Chuchu ripped out some strands of her pink hairs.

&quot;Does that sound stupid, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Anthy yawned again. She didn&#39;t have to look up to see everything 
Utena described. It sounded fantastic. 

The perfect castle. Right like the one she imagined when she had been 
a child. When she read all those fairy tales. &quot;You always wanted to be 
a prince, Tenjoh-san. So why shouldn&#39;t you have a castle? Every prince 
in those books has a castle and this here would really be a nice 
place.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Utena didn&#39;t turn around. Still she stared out of the wide lake and 
was captured for a moment in her nice dream. In a dream she had always 
dreamed alone. Since her parents died and a strange shadow gave her 
new hope. New will to live. And a seal ring with a rose sign on it. A 
dream she wanted to share now.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to live in that castle, too, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;As what? As chamber maid? You know how bad my cooking skills are.&quot;

&quot;Not as chamber maid, baka!&quot; Utena laughed and finally helped Chuchu 
back on the ground. The little pet showed her his tongue angrily and 
ran back to Anthy to hide behind her back. &quot;As princess.&quot;

Anthy opened her eyes and stared thoughtful at Utena&#39;s back. The 
taller girl didn&#39;t move. She only stared outside the water and wind 
played with her body. Automatically she crossed her arms before her 
chest and even in the pink bikini and without her uniform she looked 
like a real prince.

Me, a princess?

Her princess?

Anthy gulped and stared down at Chuchu who was fast asleep next to her 
on the towel.

How did she mean it?

&quot;A carp! A carp! Anthy! Look! A carp!&quot;

The fishing rood started to jump and suddenly Utena was very busy. 
Anthy&#39;s scream could be heard all over the forest as the proud girl 
showed her the caught fish without thinking that the bronze girl was 
afraid of the slippery animal.

***

Anthy sat alone on the cliff. Staring out to the wide lake. She had 
brought her legs to her chest and wrapped her arms around her knees. 
Her hairs were opened and covered her back. She only wore her white 
swimming suite and her glasses laid in her right hand. She squinted 
but she didn&#39;t have to see anything. She had to think. To think about 
the past two weeks. Two weeks when she didn&#39;t have to be the Rose 
Bride. When she didn&#39;t have to do whatever her groom wanted her to do. 
Two weeks when she had been happy. Really happy. When she giggled and 
simply felt free. Utena could be so funny. And clumsy. And with her 
direct kind sometimes so surprising. The pink haired girl really saw a 
friend in her. Another girl. An equal partner. It was a complete new 
feeling for Anthy and she liked it a lot. 

Six more weeks were still left before they had to return to the 
school. To start a new term.

What if she will lose a duel?

What if I have to be Saionji&#39;s or Toga&#39;s bride again?

Anthy gulped and held her knees tighter.

I don&#39;t wanna go back again. I wanna stay forever here. Together with 
Utena who makes me feel so different. So free. So happy. So being 
liked.

Being loved.

Anthy took a deep breath and tried to ignore the little voice in her 
mind.

No, she can&#39;t. Surely she doesn&#39;t!

And why did she take you on vacations then? Why did she care so nice 
for you when she saw that you can&#39;t walk as fast as she? Why did she 
buy you the milk and the ice cream? Why did she massage your shoulders 
and hold you tight during the thunderstorm? Why did she help you to 
swim?

Because she&#39;s a friend.

Why did she call you a princess?

Hm, Himemiya? Why?

Because she is a very good friend!

Do you really think so?

&quot;Morning...&quot;

Anthy winced slightly as a shadow appeared next to her and took away 
the sun. It was early in the morning and the bronze girl left the tent 
because she couldn&#39;t sleep any longer.

&quot;Good morning, Tenjoh-san.&quot; She looked up and had to smile as she saw 
Utena&#39;s sleepy appearance. Her T-shirt was crumbled, she only wore her 
sockets and her hairs were a mess. She tried to braid them the last 
evening, but almost all hairs escaped the hairdo during the night. 
Blue eyes were nothing more than small slots. With a long yawn the 
taller girl sat down next to her and rubbed her tired eyes.

&quot;How late is it?&quot;

&quot;Around seven.&quot;

&quot;Still night. Wonder why the sun is already shinning.&quot;

Anthy giggled and the desire to stroke through those messed hairs was 
almost irresistible. She raised her left hand but before she could 
reach the soft curls, Utena bowed her head and buried her face with 
another yawn in her palms.

&quot;Too early. Too early.&quot; She mumbled. Anthy smiled tenderly and placed 
her hand finally on Utena&#39;s shoulder. The taller girl didn&#39;t even 
notice it. She only yawned again and shook her head.

&quot;Do you want any breakfast, Tenjoh-san?&quot;

&quot;Breakfast?&quot; Utena looked up again and squinted. The next moment she 
rose quickly and stumbled back to their tent. &quot;Breakfast!&quot; she 
screamed and Anthy could see her searching frantically in her big 
rucksack. She put her glasses on her nose and was about to follow her 
friend as Utena returned. Still in sockets. Holding the one and only 
chocolate bar tight in the air. &quot;This is a special morning, Anthy!&quot; 
Utena looked greedy at the bar in her hand and sighed happily.

&quot;I am really addicted.&quot; She giggled as she saw Anthy&#39;s confused face. 
While she tried to open the paper carefully sat Chuchu suddenly on her 
arm. His little paws grabbed for the bar, too and soon they both were 
in a big fight.

&quot;That&#39;s MINE!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;I bought it from my own money!&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot;

&quot;Give it to me!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s the last one! I won&#39;t share!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot;

They both screamed as the bar escaped their fighting hands and fell 
down. Hobbled over some stones and finally fell over the cliff. Fell 
down the abyss and kept laying near the crystal blue water. Brown and 
blue eyes grew wide and they both looked sad at the bar. Then they 
looked angrily at each other.

&quot;That&#39;s all your fault!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;If you would have let me open it, I would have given you a bit, too.&quot;

&quot;Chu?&quot;

&quot;My chocolate bar!&quot;

&quot;Chu...&quot;

Again they looked at the brown paper with the yellow nuts on and 
sighed deeply.

&quot;That&#39;s a real tragedy.&quot;

&quot;Chu.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get my boots to rescue it.&quot; Utena took a protesting animal in 
her hands and sat him on Anthy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Here are you save, you 
little demon!&quot; With those words she turned around and ran back to 
their tent. Jumping whenever she stumbled over a stone she oversaw in 
her haste. Or when she slipped in her sockets that were now dark. Not 
white as they used to be.

Anthy sighed and stepped a little bit nearer to the cliff. Saw the 
stones lying there. Around the only chocolate bar they owned. Her eyes 
grew wide as she saw how the water almost reached it. Only two or 
three more waves and the bar would sink in the big lake forever. 
Leaving a sad Chuchu and an angry Utena behind.

&quot;Don&#39;t move!&quot; she said friendly at her pet and let the brown animal 
down. Then she corrected her glasses and stepped towards the abyss. It 
was not very deep but very stony. And steep. Anthy didn&#39;t care much 
about it. The worst that could happen was that she slipped on a stone 
and landed in the water, right? Besides would Utena be happy to have 
back her chocolate bar. Anthy liked it to see her Utena happy.

Just two more inches.

The bronze girl bowed down and felt the chocolate bar in her hands. 
She grabbed it and smiled. Then she rose again and held it with 
triumph over her head. And lost her balance.

***

&quot;This stupid pet!&quot; growled Utena as she grabbed her shoes and pulled 
them determinedly over her feet. Not caring that she trapped some tiny 
stones in her sockets. With anger she ripped at her shoelaces and 
wiped the sweat from her forehead. Shortly she leaned over to her 
rucksack and took her sunglasses out. Then she turned around and ran 
towards the cliff again. Normally it took them ten minutes to reach 
it, but when she ran she needed only half of the time. 

I will kill him!

He will get nothing of that bar!

It&#39;s mine!

Her face was red of effort and anger.

This stupid Chuchu!

At that moment she heard the scream. It was short and very high. It 
belonged to Anthy, Utena was sure. She had heard the bronze girl 
scream before. For several times. In duels when she thought that she 
would be hurt. That Utena had no chance against Saionji. That Juri 
would defeat her easily as skilled fencer. That Nanami would really 
kill her, because her brother seemed to be interested in Utena.

Nani?

Utena felt how her blood froze in her veins and speeded up. The scream 
silenced as quickly as she heard it and silence fell over the lake. 
Silence that felt threatening. There were still some birds singing, 
still the water of the lake splashing against the stones. But it was 
different now.

Nani?

Utena&#39;s heart fell as she reached the cliff. There was no sign of 
Anthy. Only Chuchu was there. Standing at the rim and jumping 
excitedly up and down. Waving his little paws and stammering his &gt;Chu 
chu&lt; the whole time.

&quot;You are really greedy, don&#39;t you know?&quot; snapped Utena who thought 
that the little pet still mourned for the chocolate bar. &quot;Where is 
Anthy?&quot; she looked around but there was no trace of the smaller girl. 
Did she decide to take a bath?

Utena frowned because Anthy never took a bath alone. She got better in 
swimming with every day but she was still afraid. She always wanted to 
have Utena by her side in the case that she would be too scared too 
move. That she would drown.

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t buck me with that damn bar!&quot; Utena rolled her eyes and looked 
over to the sea. There was no trace of Anthy, too. She didn&#39;t go back 
to the tent, because Utena didn&#39;t meet her.

&quot;Where is Anthy, Chuchu?&quot;

The little pet didn&#39;t react. He still jumped up and down and at that 
moment Utena heard the quiet groaning. She frowned and stepped next to 
Chuchu and looked down. And found Anthy. She laid on the ground of the 
abyss. Between the big stones. Her eyes were closed and her forehead 
was bloody.

&quot;Shimatta! Anthy!&quot;

Utena couldn&#39;t remember later how she made it downwards. Maybe she 
simply jumped, she didn&#39;t know. It occurred as if she knelt next to 
the injured girl the next second. Ignoring Chuchu who still squeaked 
with fear. Fear that Utena felt right now. Deep in her heart.

&quot;Anthy?&quot; She gulped as the smaller girl didn&#39;t move.

Shimatta!

She stared helpless at her best friend and gulped again. Not knowing 
what to do. What to do best. Her hand started to tremble and she felt 
suddenly very, very sick.

Shimatta!

&quot;Anthy! Say a word! Please!&quot; She felt how tears burned in her eyes as 
she bowed over the bronze girl. Two purple eyes opened and a thin 
smile appeared on the pale face. Anthy raised her hand a little bit 
but had to lay it down again as the power left her.

&quot;...bar...&quot; was all she whispered. Utena turned her head and stared in 
disbelieve at the crumbled chocolate bar the smaller girl held weakly 
in her right hand. It was bruised. Just like Anthy&#39;s cheeks. Still 
blood ran over her temples and she looked as if she would faint the 
next moment.

My bar?

My...

Shimatta!

Utena cursed silently and gulped again. 

It&#39;s all my fault!

&quot;Anthy!&quot; She bowed deeper and helped Anthy to sit up. The bronze girl 
was too weak and leaned against her chest. &quot;Anthy! Stay awake! Hey, 
little one, what does hurt? Tell me, what does hurt?&quot; Utena took a 
deep breath and looked around. A taller stone was bloody. Just like 
Anthy&#39;s left temple. Utena raised her trembling hand and stroke as 
carefully as she could violet hairs away. Anthy whimpered but was too 
weak to push that hurting hand away.

Shi...

Utena bit on her lips as she saw the wound. She couldn&#39;t define if it 
was deep and if it was dangerous, but it did bleed and that was 
serious. Bleeding was always serious.

&quot;I&#39;ll take you to the doctor, Anthy, don&#39;t worry.&quot; She said with a 
shaking voice and didn&#39;t know whom she tried to calm down with those 
words. &quot;Are you able to walk, Anthy?&quot;

Anthy tried to nod but her view was too blurred. As if she lost her 
glasses. But she was still wearing them, wasn&#39;t she? She didn&#39;t know. 
She couldn&#39;t even raise her hand to see if they were still there. All 
she could do was to sit here. Leaning against Utena&#39;s warm body. 
Against a trembling body. Hearing her calming words with a silent 
voice. Feeling how soft hands flew over her body to check if anything 
else did hurt.

I am fine!

Anthy wanted to say it, but all that left her mouth was a tortured 
whimpering as Utena touched her right leg. Pain flashed through her 
body and stars sparkled before her eyes. Darkness waited around her 
and she wanted so badly to fall into it. To close her eyes and to 
sleep. 

&quot;Anthy! Little one! Stay awake!&quot; Utena stripped her T-shirt and held 
it into the water near them. She shivered as wind played with her 
sweaty body. Now she only wore her pink bikini but it wasn&#39;t important 
to her. All that counted for her was the injured girl in her arms. 
Carefully she wetted pale cheeks and was relieved as Anthy opened her 
eyes again. Looking asking around and wincing hard as Utena tried to 
pull her on her feet.

&quot;Can you walk? We need to go back to the village. To a doctor.&quot; Utena 
gulped and felt how Anthy grabbed for her shoulders for hold. &quot;You 
bleed.&quot;

The moment when Anthy&#39;s right feet touched the ground she screamed 
tortured and fell backwards. Utena was there to hold her. Her face was 
now as pale as Anthy&#39;s.

&quot;Shimatta!&quot; she couldn&#39;t hold her back her curse and looked down at 
the foot. She couldn&#39;t see anything, but she wasn&#39;t a doctor. She 
didn&#39;t have to ask if it hurt, she could see it in Anthy&#39;s painful 
face.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we will handle that.&quot; Utena looked again around and 
finally made her decision. Carefully she pulled Anthy in her arms. 
&quot;Hold on me, Anthy. First we have to get back to our tents. Then to 
the doctor.&quot; She whispered and gulped. She knew that it would take 
them at least four hours to reach the next village. Alone Utena would 
have only needed two hours, but now she had to carry Anthy. 

Shimatta!

It&#39;s all my fault! Because of my stupid chocolate bar! 

Shimatta!

Anthy groaned put pulled her arms around Utena&#39;s neck and buried her 
face in her shoulder. Silently she sobbed and Utena knew that she was 
in great pain.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Anthy, we&#39;ll be at the doctor as soon as possible. I&#39;ll 
care for you.&quot;

Slowly Utena ascended the abyss and walked with a trembling Anthy in 
her arms towards their tent. Chuchu followed them still jumping 
excitedly around the pink haired girl. 

Still the birds were singing, the waves rushing. Crystal clear water 
reached the stones and splashed them. Rolled again into the wide lake. 
Taking a brown piece of paper with it. Brown with yellow nuts on it.
