<h1>The Capital Saga (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/capsaga-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        The healers ward was quiet as a running Utena carried the 
young man inside, Anthy and Nanami following close behind her. &quot;Could 
I have a healer examine him, please?&quot; the pink haired Captain asked 
crisply, her voice carrying it&#39;s usual command.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; the woman said to them softly. The brown haired 
healer guided them over to one of the beds, and helped the dark haired 
young man be laid out onto the sheets. &quot;May I ask what happened?&quot; she 
looked up, smiling oddly at Utena.

        &quot;A sword duel and a bit of dark magic,&quot; Shiori spoke up, 
coming in at Juri&#39;s side. The purple haired mage sighed as Utena 
looked at her, &quot;No luck tracing it back.&quot; She looked over at the 
healer and frowned to herself thoughtfully.

        &quot;I see things are still exciting around you, Utena,&quot; the 
healer murmured, her softly glowing hands just above the unconscious 
Vaun.

        Anthy blinked at the healer, then the Princess looked up at 
Utena with her dark purple hair falling into her eyes, &quot;Do you know 
her?&quot;

        Utena looked at the kneeling healer, then her eyes widened, 
&quot;Hitomi?&quot;

        The former healer of Utena&#39;s mercenary troop chuckled softly. 
&quot;It took you long enough to recognize me,&quot; Hitomi chuckled. She stood 
up, her short brown hair barely reaching her shoulders as she said, 
&quot;It seems your companion is unharmed, he just needs to rest.&quot;

        Nanami puffed out a sigh, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; She turned to Anthy and 
bowed her head, &quot;I wish to apologize again for his actions, Princess.&quot;

        Anthy shook her head, &quot;It wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;

        Nanami gave a more formal bow as the noble blonde said 
quietly, &quot;The Princess is too kind.&quot;

        &quot;The enchantment that was controlling him, it was carried in 
the black rose?&quot; Utena turned to ask Shiori crisply.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Shiori nodded gravely, &quot;though someone seems to have 
tampered with his mind a bit before he even put the rose on.&quot;

        &quot;I see where you&#39;re going with this,&quot; Nanami smiled at Utena 
wryly, &quot;but roses are commonly worn in the capital. And with the 
coronation in only a few days there&#39;ll be even more roses, as they are 
the national symbol of Ohtori.&quot;

        Utena smiled wryly, &quot;Then could we have the guards keeping an 
eye out for black roses?&quot;

        Anthy spoke up this time, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t help much. 
The black roses are often worn in mourning for the fallen king. 
There&#39;ll be a great deal of them, too.&quot;

        Juri began to swear to herself softly. &quot;This is not good,&quot; the 
lieutenant scowled, her long orange hair falling back like a cape.

        Utena nodded grimly, then she looked over at Shiori and asked, 
&quot;And you said that you had no luck tracing it back?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Shiori sighed softly, &quot;I followed the traces of magic 
back to Vaun&#39;s bedroom, and felt a much stronger concentration of 
enchantment in there. But other than that, I could find no traces of 
whoever did it.&quot;

        &quot;They just.. appeared there?&quot; Hitomi frowned.

        Anthy sighed softly, &quot;All this speculation is quite 
interesting but... what do we do now?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll stay by your side,&quot; Utena said, &quot;from what Vaun said, 
the attack was more directed at getting to you.&quot; She looked at Juri 
and Nanami, &quot;I need you to keep an eye on the guards and our company, 
make sure no black roses turn up there.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;ll try again, of course,&quot; Juri agreed grimly.

        Shiori nodded thoughtfully before looking over at Nanami. 
&quot;Does the castle have an archive of some kind? I might be able to find 
out a bit more about our possible foe, the magician Mikage,&quot; she asked 
with a slight smile.

        &quot;With the Princess&#39;s permission I&#39;ll take you there,&quot; Nanami 
said crisply. Once she received Anthy&#39;s nod she looked over at Hitomi, 
&quot;Take good care of Vaun, please.&quot; With that, Juri, Shiori and her left 
the ward together.

        The halls were crowded, filled with councilors and guests, 
nobles and peasants. Roses of all colors appeared on clothing, 
including more than a few of the black ones. Whenever Nanami saw a 
black rose she gazed at the wearer thoughtfully, looking for some sign 
of the enemy&#39;s touch.

        &quot;This is going to be irritating,&quot; Juri murmured, also scanning 
the crowd.

        Shiori shook her head, &quot;The enemy used Vaun to attack first. 
What does that mean?&quot;

        Nanami looked at her, wondering what the girl might be 
implying. &quot;Could they be trying to sow discord in our ranks?&quot; she 
asked.

        &quot;Possibly,&quot; Juri nodded thoughtfully as they ducked to avoid a 
work crew with a ladder. &quot;Watch where you&#39;re going,&quot; she barked.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; the young man blushed, his crew swiftly moving on.

        Nanami smiled to herself slightly. &quot;Or distract us enough for 
a work crew to decapitate us,&quot; she drawled impishly.

        Shiori chuckled softly, and Juri laughed. &quot;A point,&quot; Juri 
admitted.

        It took them a few more minutes, walking down winding steps 
into the cool, dry depths beneath the great castle itself until they 
reached the archives themselves. The great wooden doors opened up 
smoothly on oiled hinges, and they took a few steps inside only to 
stop and gaze in wonder. Book shelves went off into the darkness, 
carefully capped lamps generating light, the shelves themselves as 
tall as three men, at least.

        Shiori blinked a few times before softly murmuring, &quot;I hope 
this is better organized than most wizard&#39;s libraries, or we could be 
down here a long time.&quot;

        &quot;Actually, It&#39;s surprisingly well organized,&quot; Miki came around 
one of the book cases, a few books in hand. Wakaba followed close 
behind him, more books in the brown haired girl&#39;s hands and a adoring 
smile focused on the oblivious Miki.

        &quot;Miki,&quot; Juri looked at him in surprise, &quot;what are you doing 
here?&quot;

        The blue haired young courtier smiled slightly. &quot;I was 
researching the traditions of the coronation,&quot; Miki said, &quot;But once I 
heard about the attack I switched tracks.&quot;

        &quot;One step ahead,&quot; Shiori said admiringly. She shook her head, 
&quot;I suspect the military lost a great warrior when you left.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Miki blushed, unaware of the glare Wakaba was 
directing at Shiori.

        &quot;I&#39;ll leave you four to it then,&quot; Nanami smiled. She paused at 
the doorway, watching Miki explaining where he hadn&#39;t checked yet, and 
shook her head with a smile.

        The hallways were mobbed, but an single intense glare from 
Nanami usually helped clear the way. She still had a fearsome 
reputation from when she was a young noble, back when she had been a 
bit of a bane to her poor father. But everyone grows up sometime, and 
it had eventually happened to her, too. The reputation remained, 
however, and even came in handy occasionally.

        Passing the fountain Nanami slowed, then with a mild pang of 
guilt she made her way in the courtyard. She stood there by it&#39;s side 
for an unknown span of time, gazing into it&#39;s cool depths, until a 
soft gasp brought her back to reality.

        The young woman looked across the fountain, so very different 
from Nanami&#39;s memory. Instead of twin plaits, a long braid flowed down 
her back. The gentle softness once there was gone, replaced by a new 
strength. Gowns exchanged for hunting leathers. But the face, the face 
remained the very same as when they had parted at this fountain years 
ago.

        &quot;Keiko,&quot; Nanami said softly, wondering what the woman thought 
of the changes in her, too.

        &quot;Nanami,&quot; Keiko took a shaky breath, then she sighed softly. 
&quot;I guess it&#39;s time we did talk,&quot; she said to her softly.

        &quot;Love is a wonderful thing,&quot; Mikage could have been talking to 
himself, as much as the beautiful boy laying on the bed reacted. 
&quot;Fragile, yet it pulls and twists us all, in so many ways,&quot; the 
pinkish haired man smiled a bit sadly.

        A rose lay, alone of a nearby table, and he picked it up to 
sniff at it, the dark rose seeming to absorb the light all around it.

        &quot;And extremely useful to our purposes,&quot; he added coldly.
