<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The girl gasped softly, feeling the hands coming from behind her to 
stroke down the front of her slim body. She shivered, then moaned as 
the hand cupped her, gently. Then a finger gently looked for the 
opening, and Juri bent to whisper in her ear, &quot;Do you want it?&quot;

Another breathless gasp, as she thrust her hips back and forth. &quot;Oh 
yes, please,&quot; she gave the strangled cry.

Juri gave a wicked smile, then let her fangs graze her throat. A soft 
cry, and then she let her fangs slip into the sweet flesh and tasted 
the hot blood. Her hands continued to stroke, the girl shuddering and 
twisting underneath her.

Finally, the child fainted. Juri smiled fondly, gently stopping the 
bleeding before she lay the sweat covered girl into her bed. She rose 
silently, and like a ghost slipped out of the room and into the dark 
night.

Shiori smiled at her as Juri came through the window, &quot;Good evening, 
Juri-sama.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Shiori,&quot; Juri smiled. She slid into bed beside her, nuzzling 
at her playfully.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve fed again,&quot; Shiori laughed, &quot;that always gets you going.&quot; 
They played together for a time, then they relaxed in each other&#39;s 
arms. &quot;So how are things going with Utena?&quot; Shiori asked her 
curiously.

&quot;Making steady progress,&quot; Juri answered. She looked at Shiori 
thoughtfully, &quot;It doesn&#39;t make you jealous, knowing that I&#39;m after 
her?&quot;

Shiori shook her head, &quot;I know that you love me, but I can&#39;t be your 
equal. Utena is, and I think she&#39;ll be good for you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri answered, kissing her gently.



Wakaba nearly ran into the girl, who was stumbling down the hallway. 
Her eyes were heavy, a large red mark was on her neck, and a 
remarkably goofy smile was on her face. &#39;Someone was with Juri last 
night,&#39; Wakaba correctly deduced.

Wakaba walked into her classroom, and noticed the empty seat a few 
behind hers. &#39;Oh, Utena,&#39; she thought a bit sadly, &#39;I wish you could 
be here.&#39;

The two of them had first met in this classroom, the boyish transfer 
student longing in her boy&#39;s school uniform. Wakaba had volunteered to 
give her the tour of the school, and she led her around happily. When 
Wakaba&#39;s first room-mate had moved, she tentatively suggested that 
Utena move in with her, and she could barely contain the joy she felt 
when she did.

Wakaba knew what the other students thought, of course. The handsome, 
boyish Utena and Wakaba moving in together was the subject of all the 
gossips. But nothing had ever happened between them, even though she 
wouldn&#39;t have minded. But Utena was always the perfect gentleman, and 
she couldn&#39;t quite figure out how to approach her.

&#39;Other than saying something like,&#39; Wakaba thought, &#39;kiss me, you 
fool!&#39;

Then Akio had taken an interest in Utena, and Wakaba had been filled 
with fear. The Dean of Students was handsome, but he had such a bad 
reputation. He courted Utena, but each time he came to her, she blew 
him off. Finally, she agreed to go out to dinner with him.

&#39;And that&#39;s when things got really strange,&#39; Wakaba thought grimly.

Akio had carried Utena home, claiming that Utena had drank a bit too 
much. He asked Wakaba to stay with her, and filled with concern for 
her, she agreed. Utena slept like the dead for nearly three days, her 
body stiff and cold, then on the third night she awakened.

The return to wakefulness had been quite sudden, Utena laying there 
still one moment, then she literally shot right up. Her eyes were 
wild, her skin pale, but Wakaba didn&#39;t care. Tearfully she wrapped her 
arms around Utena, and her own arms came up around her. Utena shook, 
and Wakaba was astonished at how cold Utena felt. She drew back a bit, 
and saw them.

Shaking like a leaf, Utena sat there with her mouth open, her fangs 
gleaming and extended. &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Utena managed to get out.

&quot;Oh, Utena,&quot; Wakaba whispered. Suddenly, looking at her friend, 
something seemed to click inside of her head, and she knew. 
Tentatively, she asked her, &quot;What happened, when you went out with 
Akio?&quot;

Utena was shivering slightly, tightly wrapping her arms around her 
body. &quot;He lied to me,&quot; she whispered softly, &quot;he took me to the 
observatory, and then he raped me.&quot; Her eyes grew wide, &quot;He bit me 
really hard, on the neck.&quot; Her hands shook a bit as she reached up but 
she felt only whole skin at the side of her throat.

&quot;Stay here,&quot; Wakaba ordered, and ran out into the hallway. &#39;Utena&#39;s 
not eaten anything in three days,&#39; she thought, &#39;in her shoes I&#39;d be 
starving.&#39; She looked around wildly, then remembered something. &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; she softly muttered, kneeling in front 
of the mouse hole. She reached inside quickly, and yelped as something 
bit her. She grabbed, feeling something furry, and yanked it out.

Wakaba carried it into the dorm room and then hurried to Utena&#39;s side. 
&#39;I hope she knows what to do with this,&#39; was the odd thought that 
suddenly occurred to her. Utena looked at the rat in her hands, then 
she just seemed to... disappear. The rat was suddenly gone, and Utena 
firmly cradled it in her hands. The fangs gleamed in the darkness, 
extending downward, and Utena brought the struggling creature up to 
her mouth.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Wakaba cried out incoherently as a bit of blood splattered her 
cheek. Utena feeding was like a feral animal, focused only on 
satisfying her hunger. In a few moments, the rat was dead, and Utena 
cradled it in her hands. She looked up, and as her blue eyes met 
Wakaba&#39;s they seemed to be much clearer than before.

A lone tear trickled down Utena&#39;s cheek, and Wakaba was shocked to see 
it was blood. &quot;What am I?&quot; Utena asked, a expression of dawning horror 
on her face.

&#39;Of course, we eventually figured out what was going on,&#39; Wakaba 
thought. She noticed students rising from their seats, and realized 
she had daydreamed right through the class. She walked by a window and 
looked out, catching a moment of sun breaking through the gray clouds. 
&#39;Utena loved the sun,&#39; she thought sadly.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; a voice said cheerfully from behind her, jarring her 
from her thoughts. Wakaba quickly turned, and had to fight the urge to 
scowl as she saw that it was Anthy who was addressing her. She 
completely ignored the hostile look Wakaba was giving her, &quot;Could you 
help me with something?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Wakaba asked her noncommittally. She was Utena&#39;s helper, long 
before Anthy came along, and Wakaba was sure she also had something to 
do with all of the naked girls that were hanging around Utena&#39;s rooms.

Still sounding quite cheerful, Anthy asked her, &quot;Could you tell me 
anything that you can about Kanae Ohtori?&quot;



The room was nearly completely dark, only a few candles providing a 
little light. A figure sits on the chair in the middle of the room, 
mumbling to itself softly.

&quot;Mistress?&quot; a young man asked, carrying a candle ahead of him as he 
opened the door and walked into the room.

The light reveals a young woman sitting there, pale skinned. Her green 
hair falls limply over her shoulders, her eyes wide as her lips move, 
the soft mumbling continuing on. She suddenly seems to notice him, and 
a broad smile lights up her face.

&quot;My love,&quot; she smiled at him.

&quot;Mistress Kanae,&quot; he started, &quot;I&#39;m not...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Kanae smiled, getting up from her chair to step up 
beside him. &quot;Where have you been?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I was just next door,&#39; the boy blinked in surprise.

&quot;I thought you were being unfaithful again,&quot; Kanae began to run her 
fingers across his chest, &quot;if you were, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&quot;

&quot;I am your faithful servant, m&#39;lady,&quot; he managed to squeak out.

&quot;Good, good,&quot; she murmured. Her eyes narrowed in anger, &quot;If you were, 
I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&quot; He hissed in pain as her nails raked his 
chest, then she whispered, &quot;I think it would tear my heart out.&quot;

Her hand shot forward, then smoothly drew back. He flopped to the 
floor bonelessly, twitching for a moment before he was still.

Kanae looked at the still beating heart in her hand, then at the boy 
in surprise. &quot;Why, you&#39;re not Akio at all,&quot; she said wonderingly, 
bringing the heart up to her mouth to drink.</pre>
