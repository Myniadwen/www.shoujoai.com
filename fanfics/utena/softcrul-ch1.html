---------------------------------------------------------------------

The music room was an empty shell filled only with avant-garde shadows 
made by the red setting sun and a baby grand piano that sat neatly in 
the center of the room. Invading the loneliness of the space were two 
girls. The taller of the two smirked as the shorter girl, light violet 
hair and innocent violet colored eyes, whispered into her ear. Deep 
blue eyes shut for a moment and then the taller of the two whispered 
something back that made the shorter girl blush with excitement. The 
girl with the innocent eyes smiled and whispered an unexpected 
response.

&#147;Sometimes&#148;, the taller girl stated softly. &#147;I&#146;m quite sure you&#146;re more 
wicked than I am, Shiori.&#148;

The shorter girl stepped back and shrugged with a deep sigh. A cunning 
smile spread across her face as she closed her eyes and listened to the 
emptiness around her. Just in the distance a familiar footfall could be 
heard approaching. Shiori beamed, &#147;Someone&#146;s coming, Kozue.&#148;

Kouze stepped back towards the piano, brushed a stray strand of ocean 
blue hair from her eyes and waited for Shiori to come to her. The girl 
with the ocean blue hair smiled thinly as Shiori stepped close and 
wrapped delicate arms around her. It was a mild embrace that was made 
closer as Shiori heard the door creak open. The violet-eyed girl took 
Kozue into a shallow kiss and waited. The light footsteps of a fencer 
clicked into the room and stopped with sudden urgency. Shiori opened 
her eyes to catch sight of the intruder. She made sure to make clear 
eye contact. Kozue could almost feel Shiori smiling and so, feeling it 
her cue&#133;Kozue pulled Shiori just a little closer, and made the kiss 
just a little deeper. Violet eyes watched with glee as the intruder, 
light auburn ringlets framing a paled face, blue-green eyes burning 
with sadness, turned and stiffly walked out of the room. It was meant 
to hurt. It was meant to sting and burn deeply. It was a weapon of the 
cruelest design and Shiori wielded it well. As the door shut the girls 
broke the embrace. Shiori had a slight smile across her innocent 
looking face. Kozue could have easily mistaken that smile for sweetness 
if she didn&#146;t know any better. 

&#147;You&#146;re sure she won&#146;t say anything&#148;, Kozue asked merely as a 
precaution. &#147;I do have my reputation.&#148;

&#147;Hmph&#148;, Shiori&#146;s smile slipped away, &#147;Trust me. No one will ever know. 
We all have our reputations.&#148;

Kozue was satisfied with the answer. She watched as Shiori left the 
music room and wondered what the girl&#146;s true intent was, because there 
was cruelty and then there was total devastation. Kozue let the matter 
pass though. She had her own cruelty to dispense, but she noted that 
she should stay on Shiori&#146;s good side. 

So&#133;
So pretty
When there is sadness in your eyes
You&#146;re so lovely
With loneliness in your soul
You&#146;re just more beautiful to me
And I&#146;m the lucky one
Because I&#146;m the only one 
Who ever really sees
You&#146;re so pretty
You&#146;re so beautiful
But only when I hurt you
And you let me hurt you

&#147;Next!!!!&#148;

The image was burning in her mind. Perhaps it was just foolish to 
believe that she was free from such want. 

&#147;Next!&#148;

Juri was dispatching more competitors today than she had in her entire 
career as a fencer. 

&#147;Next!&#148;

Perhaps she was trying too hard to forget that she was hurt.

&#147;Next!&#148;

Perhaps she shouldn&#146;t depend on fencing to relieve her frustration.

&#147;Next!&#148;

But she didn&#146;t know what else to do.

&#147;Next!&#148;

The girl stepped up to the fencing track. Juri observed her strong and 
light stance. She noted very clearly the way the fencing foil dangled 
limply in the girl&#146;s right hand. It took less effort to disarm the girl 
and win the duel than to say the single word that shot fear through her 
fellow fencers. The girl was about to shrink off the fencing track, but 
Juri watched carefully as the girl went to pick up the fallen fencing 
foil. The girl used her left hand.

&#147;Wait&#148;, the command was strong but there was softness in her tone that 
had been missing since practice had started. &#147;Wait. Come back.&#148;

The girl looked over at the captain. 

&#147;Try again&#148;, Juri stated. &#147;This time&#133; use your left hand.&#148;

The girl took her place once again. Juri checked the girl&#146;s stance. It 
was still light but strong. Juri moved her eyes to the girl&#146;s left 
hand. Much better, she thought to her self. The girl held the foil with 
more confidence and a much better grip. It took longer for Juri to 
defeat the girl this time. As the girl stepped off the track for the 
second time Juri removed her mask and remarked, &#147;Your right hand needs 
to be stronger. Practice with your right for an hour longer than your 
left.&#148;

The girl smiled and walked into a group of her friends with relief. 

&#147;Next.&#148; 

The word hit the air much softer than it had before. But any sense of 
calm left as Juri watched Shiori step up. The girl across from Juri 
smiled innocently and slipped her mask on. Juri refrained from sneering 
and pulled her mask over her head. No one really noticed what she did 
next, and Juri really didn&#146;t realize she had done it either. But as 
Shiori prepared her self, Juri slipped the foil into her left hand. It 
was really an affront to Shiori&#146;s talent. If the cruelly innocent 
looking girl had taken care to notice she would have been offended. 
Perhaps it was the burning image eating at her soul, and perhaps it 
wasn&#146;t intentional but Juri took Shiori out of the game in just one 
move. One single stroke of Juri&#146;s sword, with her weak hand, and Shiori 
was beaten. 

&#147;Next!&#148;

Shiori stepped off the fencing track and watched Juri take out her next 
three opponents with ease. Violet eyes lingered on the fencing 
captain&#146;s face as she removed her mask. A cruelly innocent smirk was 
planted on her face. Juri was strong and she always would be. But even 
if Juri could hide her true feelings from the rest of the world Shiori 
knew&#133;Juri just couldn&#146;t hide from her. 


I dwell on the feeling I had lost
I dwell on that memory like it was my only truth
I&#146;m not so weak I can&#146;t move on
I&#146;m not so shocked I can&#146;t breath
But I&#146;m so much more breakable than you care to notice
So much more lost than you will know
Don&#146;t think just because I let you slip away
That your smile doesn&#146;t hurt my heart
Don&#146;t think your laughter doesn&#146;t cause me pain
I dwell on this feeling I thought I had lost
And it kills me


The warmth of the water embraced her but she felt no comfort. She was 
angry with her self for dwelling on something she thought she had let 
go of. The past was gone. The past was nothing and there was no reason 
why she should feel anything but total disgust at what Shiori had done. 
So why did it hurt so much? She couldn&#146;t explain it. Steam filled the 
bathroom and sat like a heavy fog around her. It was going to be a long 
night. Juri stepped out of the shower and the cold air from her bedroom 
hit her slowly. She combed out her hair and put on her nightgown. She 
tried to sleep but as usual found she could not. Her mind was racing 
with a million things. What she had walked in on implied too many 
things. It opened to many doors and Juri wasn&#146;t sure how to close them. 
If Ruka were still alive he could have told her all the reasons why 
Shiori should just be cast aside like an insect. Then Juri could try to 
beat him to a pulp and as he laughed at her for becoming so angry she 
could laugh too. Blue-green eyes closed and a small smile formed on her 
lips. She had always hated Ruka for being so conniving, but she missed 
his honesty. She missed having someone around to shove her nose in the 
truth. She wished they hadn&#146;t parted on such sour terms. &#147;It&#146;ll be all 
right&#148; he had said &#147;Don&#146;t worry&#148;. But she did worry. She worried 
because what she thought was gone and lost forever was only buried and 
waiting to consume her again. Juri sat up in her bed and looked out her 
window. The moon was hiding behind clouds. She wondered if it would 
rain soon. With or with out the rain, a storm was coming and she could 
feel it creeping. 


Sometimes I worry for nothing 
I don&#39;t know what to do when it starts to come to you 
And I refuse to let you take me to where I once was 
My past is buried for a reason 
Lost in the ashes of a forgotten season 
Misplaced in the dust of a trampled sky 
I am left but to wonder 
How my heart was stolen 
And why I refuse to breakdown 
And cry



Days washed by like empty seasons and Juri found the strength to bury 
the burn of the image of Shiori and Kozue locked in a kiss. She 
convinced her self that it was meant to hurt and while it had been very 
affective she just couldn&#146;t succumb to it any longer. She walked with 
steady purpose into the lunchroom and sat across from Miki almost 
expressionless for a moment. He was full of some good cheer. His blue 
eyes flashing with brilliance as he discussed his up coming piano 
competition. Juri was happy for the good company but as usual she kept 
that note to her self. As lunch waned Juri managed a smile or to while 
she listened to Miki speak, but she lost her smile as she saw Kozue 
approaching. 

&#147;And what is my brother up to today&#148;, Kozue asked lightly as she 
approached.

Miki sighed and looked up at as his twin with a forced smile. &#147;Nothing 
really&#148;, he mentioned. &#147;Just getting ready for the competition.&#148; 

Kozue nodded. She eyed Juri curiously and walked off. Juri tried not to 
pay any attention and looked over at Miki who seemed a little worried.

&#147;It&#146;s unlike you to let her bother you like this&#148;, Juri mentioned. &#147;Or 
maybe she isn&#146;t what&#146;s bothering you.&#148;

Miki shrugged a little. &#147;Kozue and I had been on good terms for a long 
while and then just a few days ago&#133;&#148; Miki paused and looked over at 
Juri. &#147;We had a little fight. I&#146;m sure it&#146;s nothing. Brother and sister 
quarrels are bound to come up.&#148;

Miki dismissed the matter much too quickly for Juri&#146;s tastes. She let 
it go though. She let it slip back into her mind as a thought never to 
be recovered. Feeling a need Juri mentioned in passing the up coming 
fencing championships and asked politely if Miki was ready for them. As 
lunch ended Juri unexpectedly wondered what it was Kozue was hoping to 
discover as she walked by. It wouldn&#146;t be hard to find out. 

As Kozue walked by one of the various columns at the Ohtori Academy she 
heard a very stolid and recognizable voice call to her. She stopped in 
her tracks, not bothering to look over her shoulder to see whom it was. 
She knew who it was and Kozue was a little surprised it took Juri so 
long to talk to her. 

&#147;Jealous&#148;, Kozue stated rather glibly.

Juri&#146;s arms were folded around her waist as she leaned up against a 
column. She huffed a little and then replied rather flatly, &#147;Why should 
I be jealous?&#148;

A small smile stretched across Kozue&#146;s face. Her ocean blue eyes 
flashed as she spun around to look at Juri. &#147;How like you to be 
concerned for my brother&#146;s feelings&#148;, she said as almost a whisper. 
&#147;What do you want?&#148;

&#147;That fight you and your brother had&#148;, Juri said. &#147;It&#146;s really not my 
concern. Just tell me one thing Kozue.&#148;

Kozue was never one to back down from a challenge, and Juri seemed to 
be just teetering on one. She stepped closer to Juri and waited. Her 
ocean blue eyes nearly burning with a challenge of their own. 

&#147;What would you like to know Miss Arisugawa&#148;, Kozue asked softly.

&#147;Was it intentional?&#148;

The girl with the deep blue hair didn&#146;t even have to ask what Juri was 
referring to. She smiled and whispered into the fencer&#146;s ear. As she 
stepped away Kozue noted the oddly stoic manner in which Juri held 
herself. 

&#147;Well&#148;, Kozue said as she began to walk off. &#147;She was right&#133; So 
pretty&#133;&#148;

Given the circumstances Juri contained her self very well. But Juri 
couldn&#146;t afford to let anyone see her react. She couldn&#146;t afford to 
speak her true feelings or act on her true impulses. She swallowed it 
down as if pain were merely water, just liquid death to be consumed and 
forgotten. 


Beauty lies in the oddest places
It seeps into the skin when least expected
I wonder if you know how beautiful the cruel can be
I wonder if you know how beautiful sorrow looks
And right now&#133;
If I could run to your side and wipe away your tears
I would
If only to place more there
Glimmering like diamonds on your face
If only to have you beg me
I can promise you never
I did promise you never
I wonder how much hurt you can bare
I wonder how long I can give it to you
And still&#133; never break my promise



It was quiet in that special place she had shared with Ruka. At night 
it was especially lovely. The moon full and reflecting in the deepness 
of the water below her. As she sat there her hand blindly ran across 
her chest as if it were searching for something. Juri caught herself 
and sighed. It was gone. The locket was destroyed and it was gone. She 
only reached for the piece of phantom jewelry when she was really 
worried and upset. Her blue-green eyes looked out over the water and 
pleaded for refuge, but the stubbornly strong part of her soul would 
not allow tears. After Ruka passed away, after Shiori hurt her for the 
last time, after the hero had left she swore never again would she 
waste her tears. 

&#147;Faithless love&#133; like a river flows. Like raindrops falling&#133;on a broken 
rose. Down in some valley&#133; where nobody knows. And the night comes in&#133; 
like a cold dark wind. Faithless love&#133; like a river flows&#148;, her voice 
was soft and a little off key but she sang well. &#147;Faithless 
love...Where did I go wrong? Too many stories&#133;Too many hearts&#133;where 
nobody is right and nobody was wrong&#133; Faithless love will find you and 
the misery entwine you&#133;&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t know you sang&#148;, a voice cut in softly. 

&#147;I don&#146;t&#148;, Juri sighed. She didn&#146;t turn around. She recognized the 
voice behind her, but she wasn&#146;t prepared to see it. &#147;I haven&#146;t sung 
since I was eight&#148;, Juri confessed. &#147;She told me once that I shouldn&#146;t 
so I stopped.&#148;

&#147;You have a lovely voice&#148;, the person behind her replied. &#147;So?&#148;

Juri sighed and turned around. &#147;It&#146;s you?&#148;

&#147;Yes it is&#148;, the owner of the voice was a tall girl. Bright blue eyes 
an inch away from being angelic, with soft pink hair that fell to her 
shoulders and made her the kind of person one couldn&#146;t help but be 
near. &#147;I had to visit&#148;, she confessed. &#147;Make sure that I hadn&#146;t dreamed 
the whole thing.&#148;

Juri smiled and it surprised her greatly. However she remembered that 
the girl that was now in front of her had that power about her. Juri 
closed her eyes and tried not to cry. &#147;Has Anthy found you yet&#148;, Juri 
asked softly. 

The girl in front of her smiled. &#147;Is she looking for me&#148;, the girl 
asked almost naively. &#147;I had a feeling she might be but&#133;&#148; the girl 
looked deeply into Juri&#146;s eyes and shook her head. &#147;Don&#146;t you ever 
worry about yourself. I thought I had freed everyone of their chains.&#148;

&#147;Some chains come back on occasion&#148;, Juri muttered.

&#147;Ah! Well&#133;What are you going to do&#148;, the girl said playfully. &#147;You know 
you&#146;re the only one who&#146;s having so much trouble.&#148;

Juri huffed a bit. &#147;Really? Is that so?&#148;

&#147;Afraid it is&#148;, the girl replied with a smile. &#147;Nanami is doing great. 
Her obsession is no longer the all consuming factor in her life&#133;of 
course she&#146;s still a bit of mischief maker but&#133;That&#146;s the way she is. 
Miki has is music back as I&#146;m sure you&#146;ve noticed. Touga and Saonji 
have graduated but they seem to be doing alright...&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t believe you checked up on us&#148;, Juri nearly laughed.

The girl with the pink hair started to do some leg stretches and 
smiled. &#147;What kind of prince would I be if I didn&#146;t check up on those I 
helped on occasion.&#148; the girl looked over at Juri and then said, &#147;Don&#146;t 
answer that. Look I can&#146;t stay much longer. I really have other stuff 
to be doing, but I noticed you were having some trouble and...&quot;

&#147;Doesn&#146;t the white horse get tired&#148;; Juri quipped. 

The girl looked very serious for a minute and it caught Juri&#146;s 
attention. &#147;In the two years I&#146;ve been gone you were doing really well. 
Who was that nice girl you were dating five months ago?&#148;

&#147;That&#133;&#148;

&#147;Is none of my business I know that. I just thought&#133;&#148;the girl paused. 
She was trying hard to find something comforting to say. &#147;Juri&#133; You 
live to make her happy, but she&#146;s only happy when you suffer. It isn&#146;t 
right. You know you can do better.&#148;

&#147;Your stretching&#148;, Juri said softly. &#147;What are you afraid to tell me 
Utena?&#148;

Utena smiled her bright and wonderful eyes full of thought and concern. 
&#147; What&#146;s the worse that could happen if you decided to do one thing for 
yourself&#148;, she asked softly. 

Juri was speechless. She thought for a long moment and could not come 
up with an answer.

&#147;I have to go now&#148;, Utena said sadly. &#147;I have things to do.&#148; The girl 
with the bright smile began to walk away.

&#147;Wait&#148;, Juri shouted. It was almost desperate. &#147;Wait Utena!&#148;

Utena turned around with a soft smile.

&#147;What will you do if she finds you&#148;, Juri asked.

&#147;I&#146;ll hold her close. Never let her slip from my hands again&#133; and 
together&#133; we&#146;ll shine&#148;, Utena replied. 

Juri watched the girl walk away and felt the hero&#146;s strength. That girl 
had shown Juri twice that sometimes the real world could be forgotten 
and dreams could come true. Every time Juri tried to deny that Utena 
proved her wrong. 

&#147;What would happen if just once I did something for myself&#148;, Juri asked 
herself. She still couldn&#146;t answer the question. But she wanted to&#133; and 
she would just have to find out for herself.


Every night
I begged for you
Every night
I longed for your touch
Every day
I watched you with another
Every day
I watched you hurt me
I watched your joy at seeing me in sadness
Every time I see you
I know what you want
Every time I see you
I know what you&#146;ll take
Are you more breakable than I am
Is your heart so much stronger
Can you deny me any longer
Every night
Every day
Every time



She awoke as her hand hit the empty space next to her. It surprised 
her, the emptiness. She didn&#146;t know she could feel such a thing. A veil 
of relief filled her as she heard the shower running. She hadn&#146;t been 
abandoned. Just as she was about to settle back into the bliss of sleep 
she heard a small rap on the door. Blue-green eyes strained threw the 
darkness to catch the time on the clock. It was five a.m. She slipped 
off of her bed and padded over to the door with light and strong steps. 
She opened the door and was greeted by innocent yet cruel violet eyes. 

&#147;Shiori&#148;, she questioned softly. 

The girl before her looked ready to cry, but Juri recognized the look. 
She had seen it before. 

&#147;Can I come in&#148;, Shiori asked politely. &#147;I&#133; couldn&#146;t sleep and I&#133; I&#133;&#148;

The violet-eyed girl tried to step inside but Juri got in her way.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry Shiori but you can&#146;t come in&#148;, Juri said firmly but softly. 

Shiori looked up at Juri; crocodile tears ready to burst. &#147;But Juri I 
need you&#133; I-&#147;

Juri smiled politely. &#147;But you don&#146;t Shiori. You don&#146;t need me. If you 
need to talk I can talk with you tomorrow&#148;, she said. 

Shiori seemed taken back a bit. &#147;Do you hate me that much now&#148;, she 
asked innocently and cruelly all at once.

Juri looked down at the girl in front of her and sighed. &#147;I&#146;ve known 
you too long to ever truly hate you&#148;, she began and Shiori seemed to 
get excited. &#147;But&#148;, Juri broke the excitement with her sincere tone; 
&#147;You can not come in. Not tonight.&#148;

&#147;I lov-&#147;

&#147;No. You don&#146;t&#148;, Juri interrupted. &#147;You don&#146;t know what that really is 
yet. I&#146;ll talk to you tomorrow Shiori.&#148;

And with that Juri closed the door. She sighed as she heard Shiori 
slowly walk down the dorm&#39;s hall. She brushed her light auburn hair 
back with her fingers and walked slowly back towards the bed. Just as 
she did she heard the shower stop and she smiled. The bathroom door 
opened slowly and a girl wrapped in a terry cloth robe leaned politely 
in the doorway.

&#147;Who was that&#148;, she asked softly. &#147;Anyone I should worry about?&#148; There 
was a playful sense to her tone. She walked over to Juri who was 
desperately trying to keep her balance.

&#147;No one to worry about&#148;, Juri stated. &#147;Just an old friend with too much 
time on her hands.&#148;

The girl smiled wistfully. Her eyes were bright and her smile was 
brighter. &#147;Well&#148;, she said softly as she wrapped her arms around Juri&#146;s 
waist. &#147;I guess I shouldn&#146;t worry then.&#148;

&#147;No&#133;you shouldn&#146;t&#148;, Juri replied her voice a mere whisper. She held the 
girl closer and wondered if the feeling she had was what it was to be 
free. 

&#147;You seem nervous&#148;, the girl said as she looked into Juri&#146;s eyes. &#147;And 
a little lost.&#148;

Juri sighed. &#147;You&#146;re the only other person I know who can do that&#148;, she 
confessed. &#147;You can see right through me. I&#148;, she paused as the girl 
slipped from the embrace and began to walk over to the bed. &#147;I just 
forgot for a moment.&#148;

The girl didn&#146;t ask any further questions. She knew what Juri meant. 
Juri walked over to the bed and sank into the warm arms that waited for 
her; happy in knowing that she finally did something for herself. She 
looked once more into the eyes of the girl next to her, deep and cruel 
as the ocean, but softer than the sky.

&#147;There is cruelty and then there is total devastation&#148;, the girl 
whispered. &#147;And you don&#146;t deserve either. Will you sing to me?&#148;

&#147;What shall I sing&#148;, Juri asked.

&#147;Something&#133;deep&#148;, the girl replied and took Juri into a kiss softer 
than tears and deeper than all expectations.


All I love
Is all I lose
But I&#146;ll be true
All I need
Is in my arms
I&#146;ll keep it safe from harm
But&#133;
My heart my heart was broken
For I wore it on my sleeve
I shall keep this moment safer
Than what she never felt for me
And I&#146;ll sail down every ocean
And I&#146;ll sing a long sad song
For though I know I have you
In the morning 
You&#146;ll be gone



End&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..
