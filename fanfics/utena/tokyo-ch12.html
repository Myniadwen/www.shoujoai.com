<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 12 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        Anthy just froze, standing there in the open doorway, watching 
Juri kissing the slightly shorter Utena. The other girl hesitated for 
a moment, then she returned that kiss passionately, her arms wrapping 
around Juri. Silently, Anthy turned around, closing the door 
soundlessly behind her. A single tear, a drop of blood, dripped down 
her cheek.

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Anthy murmured, wiping the blood away. She had come up 
there to talk to Utena, to find out if what Juri had told her was 
true. &#39;Obviously, it is,&#39; she thought bitterly.

        The hallway was silent as Anthy strode to the suite belonging 
to Utena&#39;s Aunt, opening up the door and walking inside. Wakaba looked 
up from where she was sitting on the couch and her eyes widened as she 
took in Anthy&#39;s wild eyed look.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Wakaba asked worriedly.

        Anthy strode by her to the bedroom door and paused. &quot;No,&quot; she 
said to her softly, &quot;no, I&#39;m not.&quot; She carefully avoided waking the 
other girls as she went into the darkness of the room, looking around 
for a certain something. The little case was packed away in a bag, and 
her hands shook as she took her old glasses out.

        They gleamed in the dim light shining in from outside as Anthy 
turned them over in her fingers. She hadn&#39;t really needed to wear them 
after she had been made a vampire, since Juri had changed her. She 
slid the glasses on, an odd expression on her face, then collected a 
few stakes and slipped them away into her clothes.

        Wakaba looked up at her oddly as the now glasses wearing Anthy 
strode out into the silence of the livingroom. She reached the outer 
door before Wakaba softly ventured out, &quot;Should I tell Utena where 
you&#39;re going?&quot;

        &quot;I won&#39;t be gone long,&quot; Anthy said as the door closed behind 
her.

        Ruka frowned slightly as he stepped out of the bathroom. 
&quot;Something odd going on there,&quot; the blue haired young man noted.

        &quot;I hope that she&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Wakaba murmured.

        Ruka raised an eyebrow, &quot;I thought you resented her.&quot;

        Wakaba blushed. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I know Utena 
cares about her, and I don&#39;t want to see her hurt.&quot;

        A wry smile on Ruka&#39;s face, &quot;Just like me and Juri.&quot;

        &quot;What about Juri?&quot; Shiori asked them as she walked in, her 
short purple hair artfully styled to give her a sultry, just tumbled 
out of bed look.

        Ruka and Wakaba sweatdropped.

        Anthy reached the street level, letting the cool night air 
wash over her. The moon was merely a half crescent above her, 
partially lighting the street around her. &#39;I should have known,&#39; Anthy 
thought irritably as she strode into the night, &#39;I should have 
realized!&#39;

        A bare whisper of sound, and Anthy swiftly turned in place, 
grabbing the shocked looking mugger by the throat. With a eerie ease 
she lifted him right up one handed and then held him dangling there. 
The man&#39;s eyes widened as he struggled there uselessly, and the scent 
of urine filled the air as he pissed himself in sheer terror.

        &quot;I&#39;m having a very bad night,&quot; Anthy said to him coldly.

        Seeing the irritated look on her face, the slightly glowing 
eyes, the older man struggled even harder. His eyes bugged out 
slightly as he fought on, trying to get a full breath of air into his 
lungs. &quot;Oh, God...&quot; he managed to get out.

        &quot;I want you to do something for me,&quot; Anthy said to him softly, 
&quot;you are going to go right home, and not bother anyone else tonight.&quot; 
He nodded wildly in agreement as she continued, &quot;If I catch out in the 
night again...&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; he asked weakly.

        With a chilly little smile on her face Anthy vowed, &quot;I&#39;ll kill 
you.&quot;

        Tossing the man down to the ground Anthy felt an odd sense of 
satisfaction as he ran away from her as fast as his legs could carry 
him. &#39;Utena wouldn&#39;t approve of that,&#39; Anthy mused. A moment&#39;s 
thought, &#39;Damn her, anyway.&#39;

        It felt good, somehow, striking such terror in the man. Anthy 
had been holding back these past few months, restraining herself to 
try to live up to the code of behavior Utena had practiced. &#39;No more,&#39; 
she finally resolved, &#39;not again.&#39;

        &quot;Never hold back,&quot; had been what Integra Hellsing had often 
told her when they were training together, and now she wished she had 
followed that advice. A blush marked the dusky vampire&#39;s face as she 
remembered a certain moment...

        They had sparred together often back then, the slim gray 
haired young woman and Anthy. Both of them dressed in simple leotards 
they fought across the mats, learning the moves that might help save 
Anthy&#39;s life one day. A few simple tosses and throws, followed up by 
the precise strike of a stake to the heart.

        They closed in together, their breasts pressing up against 
each other as they strained to defeat each other&#39;s strength. Anthy 
felt her breath coming a bit faster, and noted a slight flush to 
Integra&#39;s normally pale cheeks. Surprisingly the vampire slayer&#39;s face 
darted forward, pressed warm lips to Anthy&#39;s, and she relaxed in 
surprise.

        Thump!

        Taking advantage of that short moment of weakness Integra 
twisted her body and sent them both down to the mats, Integra laying 
atop of her. &quot;Always be prepared,&quot; Integra murmured, her body&#39;s length 
gently laying over Anthy&#39;s own.

        &quot;That wasn&#39;t fair,&quot; a fiercely blushing Anthy was panting 
softly, Integra&#39;s hair tickling her face as she gazed down at her, &quot;a 
vampire wouldn&#39;t have kissed me.&quot;

        A mysterious little smile teased Integra&#39;s lips as she said, 
&quot;And why not? I certainly find you attractive enough.&quot; She bent down 
to catch Anthy&#39;s lips once again, her hands gently stroking down the 
front of the smaller woman&#39;s body.

        &quot;I... I&#39;ve never...&quot; Anthy stammered.

        Integra drew back just a bit, giving Anthy a chance to get 
some air. &quot;Do you want me to stop? she asked her simply. A slight 
smile teased her lips, &quot;Just say the word, and we&#39;ll both go out of 
this room and pretend that this never happened.&quot;

        Gasping softly Anthy managed, &quot;Don&#39;t stop.&quot;

        With a wicked laugh Integra nibbled on Anthy&#39;s neck even as 
she gently pulled the straps of her leotard down, &quot;You have no idea 
how long I&#39;ve wanted to do this.&quot;

        &quot;You might have told me,&quot; Anthy managed as Integra teased her 
bare nipples to life.

        A silken tongue teased each breast, swirling around them like 
chocolate ice-cream cones. A teasing of the nipples with Integra&#39;s 
teeth then she answered, &quot;I was trying to be subtle, and you just 
weren&#39;t getting the hint.&quot; A gentle nip, &quot;So, this.&quot;

        &quot;Oh,&quot; Anthy gasped softly, and Integra bit again.

        A slim hand slid down Anthy&#39;s belly, sliding into dark curls 
of hair. Integra&#39;s fingers gently quested, bringing a shiver of 
delight from her. She slid into wetness, then the pale woman&#39;s eyes 
widened slightly when her fingers hit an unexpected barrier.

        &quot;You&#39;re still a virgin...&quot; Integra looked at her in shock, 
drawing her hand back slightly.

        Anthy grasped that hand, meeting Integra&#39;s gaze trustingly. 
&quot;Don&#39;t stop,&quot; she repeated softly, drawing those long, delicate 
fingers down once more.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be gentle,&quot; Integra said softly. She stroked the outer 
lips gently, raising her excitement even as she resumed her worship of 
those generous breasts. She teased, tongue and fingers playing a 
littler dance, making Anthy squirm in her want.

        &quot;Ah!&quot; Anthy cried as sharp nails and a firm thrust took her 
cherry, then cried out again as another burst of pleasure flowed over 
her.

        Anthy smiled fondly in memory, then shook her head. They had 
both known it couldn&#39;t last, she was bound to stop her brother while 
Integra was devoted to the Royal Order. But the last months she had 
been spent in England had been terribly sweet, Integra teaching her 
the techniques to pleasure her in return. And Anthy had been an eager 
student.

        &#39;You could have had all of that, Utena,&#39; Anthy thought, and 
felt an odd moment of pain when she realized that she was thinking of 
Utena in the past tense. When she had seen Utena with Juri, Anthy had 
known it was over.

        The wind blew her long hair back from her face and Anthy 
smiled to herself slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll tell her tonight,&quot; she murmured 
softly...
