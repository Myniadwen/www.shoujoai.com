<h1>Golden Apples at Their Feet</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Juri watched the two girls by the fountain embrace, and save an 
eyebrow arching, her expression remained as it usual was, stoically 
cool. She did not linger in her spot but resumed walking after the 
almost shock of the scene settled into her system. Her shoes silently 
clicked along the walkway until she arrived at her destination. 

There were an innumerable amount of secluded and secret gardens, 
ponds, fountains and other patches of quiet scattered about the 
immense campus of Ohtori. She had a very peculiar knack for finding 
the best of the hidden places and her favorite was the garden that was 
not a garden, filled with flowers and pretty plants left to the wild, 
to grow as they would. Juri sat on a small patch of clover and grass 
that was being intruded upon by a raucous band of violets and tiny 
yellow flowers she could not name. 

A deep breath filled her lungs and opposed to what many thought her 
character she laid back, folding her arms behind her head as a 
makeshift pillow. The air was always awash in the thick sent of roses, 
though there were none around her. But then all of Ohtori had that 
scent, sweet and decayed by the fall of too many petals. Swept to the 
wind and lost, like innocence or faith. Juri tried not to linger on 
thoughts of that kind. Instead she shut her eyes and considered what 
she could do with what she had seen on her walk.

She knew what others would do with the knowledge she had. They&#39;d use 
it to advance their own wills and desires. Crush the unsuspecting two 
with rumors and the giggled whispers of classmates. The image played 
through her mind again accompanied by the brief remembrance of what 
the one had said to the other. It had been the kind of romantic 
sentiment that made her teeth hurt. Not because it was overly sweet, 
which it was or because the words were stated falsely, far from it in 
fact. No the words were just filled with the type of complete faith 
and devotion that seemed to have left her long ago and she envied it. 
The very notion that love did not have to bruise and kill did not seem 
possible to her any longer. And yet&#133; there they had been locked 
together in a picture perfect embrace. A kiss and whispered promise of 
never parting leaving both their lips. 

Hazel eyes opened slowly. The scent of something smoky and spiced 
approaching caught in her nostrils and she wanted to grin. She 
repressed it though. Juri feared being too content with the person 
approaching. Dreaded what would ever happen if she cared for another 
as she had once cared for Shiori. She didn&#39;t want to wear another 
chain around her neck.

The smell of spice and smoke grew accompanied by the sound of a soft 
footfall moving through the grass. Juri&#39;s eyes shut again, she took in 
regulated breaths and attempted to slow the increasing beat of her 
heart.

Secluded places are best
For things like this
And quiet thoughts
Are so swiftly excited
By the closeness of something approaching
One untamed
Untouched by boundaries and chains
One who knows too well
The name I wish to live up to 
One who can take too often
What I offer with purring gratitude
And I am undone by her very will
To leave me breathless
Tear away the angel wings
Crack the marble exterior of my existence
 Make me stalk after her as prey
And take and taste and live bare in the wild

Juri felt the girl creep up next to her. Heard the swish of a school 
skirt against the grass. The hint of smoldering spices collected in 
her nostrils. And then&#133; there was the slow press of the girl&#39;s weight 
as she straddled Juri&#39;s waist and leaned forward touching noses. Juri 
opened her eyes to meet with the blue above her. The girl grinned and 
pulled back.

&quot;I saw something very interesting on my way over&quot;, the girl beamed and 
then moved back to her previous position, lips seconds from those 
beneath her. &quot;Did you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing spectacular&quot;, Juri commented. &quot;Just a prince and her 
princess.&quot;

&quot;So civilized&#133;What kind of sterling metaphor would they use if they 
saw us Arisugawa?&quot; She planted her hands on either side of Juri&#39;s 
head, resting her weight and leaving her vulnerable.

Juri took quick advantage reversing positions, the girl, now beneath 
her, growled almost happily. And seeing the content Juri dipped 
forward her long auburn locks veiling the quick kiss she left upon the 
girl&#39;s lips.

&quot;They&#39;d be too speechless to call us anything Kozue. But maybe we&#39;re a 
fencer and her fan girl, or angel and a devil&#133; or&#133; maybe&#133; a panther 
and her-&quot;

&quot;If you call me prey I&#39;ll leave so many marks on you there&#39;ll be no 
more questions as to what you prefer.&quot;

The panther chuckled releasing her hold and rocking back onto her 
knees, &quot;I was going to say mate but somehow I think you&#39;d equate that 
word to prey.&quot; She watched blue eyes narrow and resumed her position 
on top before Kozue found the gumption to pounce.

There was a moment when they just stared into each other&#39;s eyes. A 
fire burning between glances waiting to erupt and when it did it was 
all consuming. Lips meeting hurriedly as hands clawed at testy fabric 
and buttons popped in a race for supremacy. The winner was never clear 
between the two as the pulse of rushed sex turned to the slow 
deliverance of pleasure. 

It is that turn that frightens me at times
I don&#39;t want your love
That word damages
I don&#39;t want you to say there is only me
That promise lies 
Quickly dies with the passage of time
But aren&#39;t we doomed
When we play at not caring
Aren&#39;t we lost when we deny
Because more than I bite
I want those soft caresses you are so careful to give
I need those admired glances when you don&#39;t think I know
We are at a bend
A divide that could become too great
Do we still have a chance to confess
Or has fate left us too late

The teacher in charge of detention did a poor job of ignoring the 
grass stains when Kozue sauntered into the classroom to do her time, 
but they were hard to miss especially considering the small tears and 
missing buttons that accompanied them. The bite mark on the inside of 
her right thigh was also hard to miss as her already short skirt slid 
up when she took a seat and propped her legs defiantly on the top of 
the desk. 

She sneered in the teacher&#39;s general direction as he attempted not to 
stare by filling out another detention slip with the new multitude of 
infractions Kozue had just demonstrated. His hands fumbled nervously 
as he tore it from the pad. Kozue flipped him off when he handed it to 
her and chuckled as his face turned beet red while he wrote yet 
another slip for her &quot;attitude&quot;. 

If Kozue had been anyone other than her charming self she would have 
already been expelled. But she was (not only the daughter of wealthy 
man who made very generous donations to the school, and the twin 
sister to the school&#39;s resident musical prodigy) a very cunning and 
clever girl despite the story her grades told. Not to mention the 
cluster of male and female teachers she had in a strangle hold because 
of their inability to &quot;keep it in their pants&quot; as it were. 

Her left hand brushed through her hair and she pulled out the few bits 
of grass and clover. Amid the small pieces of greenery was a mangled 
yellow flower. She brought it to her nose but it had no scent. Her 
liquid blue eyes shut a moment, Juri&#39;s voice clear in her head, &quot;I was 
going to say mate&#133;&quot;

Kozue didn&#39;t know how to feel about it. On one hand it pleased her 
greatly to be considered so wildly dear, and on the other hand she had 
trouble reconciling the fact that she was not at all a panther. If it 
were true, and it was, that she and Juri were wild creatures she 
doubted very much that they were the same types of wild. Different 
species really, so how could they ever be &quot;mates&quot;? 

She shrugged and then she went over the other thing she had seen that 
day, the prince and princess of the school kissing lovingly by a 
secluded pond. It was so perfectly sweet she wanted to retch. In fact 
it was almost too perfect, she wondered if there was something about 
the happy couple that was the least bit dark. She laughed softly even 
if there was a dark past between the prince and her lover it was 
obviously forgotten and forgiven. 

The teacher cleared his throat in an irritated manner causing Kozue to 
look over in his direction. He held a piece of paper in his hand; brow 
furrowed and eyes carefully analyzing the small bit of text and 
signature at the bottom. Finally he appeared to give up trying to find 
fault with the note and shook his head.

&quot;Kaoru&quot;, his voice was hoarse as he ambled over to her with the paper. 
&quot;Your lucky day it seems&quot;, he stated accusingly placing the note on 
the desk. 

She merely batted her eyelashes and smiled sweetly before quickly 
picking up the paper and looking it over. She frowned. The teacher 
looked concerned but Kozue growled at him before stomping out of the 
classroom.

Once lost 
I am unretrievable
For I go to a place
That no one can see
That no one knows
It can be dark or filled with light
Either way I am blind
And my heart sinks so I can not feel
I could vanish and no one would know
I could fill the sea with my tears and no one would hear
For I call
Like the ocean breaking upon the rocks
A wolf to the moon
I call
And I am answered by someone most unexpected

There were very few people who had the power to pull Kozue Kaoru out 
of a three hour detention (for which she was two hours late), and none 
of them were people she was ever overly excited to see. She looked 
over the white sheet of paper in her hands, suppressed a growl, and 
tried to figure out what it was that Akio Ohtori could possibly want 
with her. Kozue would never say she hated the acting chairman. She 
just didn&#39;t trust him. He may have had a wild streak but he was far to 
civilized more of devilish king, than a wolf.  

The elevator ride to Akio&#39;s office was surprisingly swift and when the 
doors opened to the overly impressive view of the campus Kozue 
shrugged. 

Akio was lounging on a white leather couch near the window. A smile 
graced his face that screamed suave and malicious intent. Kozue really 
didn&#39;t feel the need to waste time.

&quot;What do you want&quot;, she asked coolly, hands on her hips in defiance.

&quot;A favor.&quot;

&quot;You still owe me for that last favor I did you.&quot;

His smile slipped to a tiny smirk, voice low as he spoke, &quot;I suppose 
you are correct, what would you like me to do?&quot;

She shook her head, &quot;I was just gonna ask the same thing.&quot;

Akio reached into his shirt pocket and held out an envelope, &quot;Deliver 
this.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it. Deliver this invitation and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re invited 
as well&quot;, he stood and approached her. &quot;I&#39;m throwing a masquerade as a 
reward for the excellent job the student council is doing. Of course 
other students and faculty are being invited as well. You know honor 
students, top educators that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;Sounds terribly dull.&quot;

He chuckled, &quot;Of course but I&#39;m sure you&#39;d find someone there to&#133; keep 
you entertained.&quot; 

&quot;What about the costume?&quot;

&quot;One will be sent your way of course. Now&#133;will you deliver this&quot;, he 
held the envelope up again.

She shrugged and stepped up to snatch the invitation from Akio&#39;s 
hands. 

&quot;You should take more care of that uniform of yours&quot;, Akio said as she 
walked away.

Kozue ignored him.

For every lie I&#39;ve told
There is a punishment waiting for me
Something dark and slick
Cold and full of fury
I&#39;ll never escape
What this is
This affair we linger on
The hot nights
Quick afternoons
The biting air around us
It is ending
And I&#39;ll soon pay the price for what I have said
That I am not jealous 
That this is only a game
And that you my love should treat it the same

&quot;Kozue?&quot; 

Juri&#39;s voice was crisp against the warm night air. Her eyes caught 
only the darkness of her room. The girl in her arms shifted with a 
grunt.

&quot;Kozue?&quot;

&quot;Mmmm&quot;, was the reply followed by the quick feel of her tongue 
teasingly dart out and lick the closest body part.

Juri tensed for a moment before continuing. &quot;I saw you coming out of 
the chairman&#39;s office today.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;So what were you doing there?&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa, I swear to God I don&#39;t have time to put up with any 
jealousy crap. I was there as a favor.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Juri shut her eyes and then asked, &quot;What kind of favor?&quot;

&quot;Not your business.&quot; Kozue scrambled out of her comfortable position 
in Juri&#39;s embrace. &quot;I don&#39;t owe you anything Arisugawa. I&#39;m not your 
girlfriend. Now if you&#39;ve you forgotten that then&#133;&quot;

The panther sighed, &quot;Then?&quot;

&quot;Then that&#39;s it. We have sex Juri. Really good, fucking sex and that&#39;s 
it. I won&#39;t offer you anything other than that.&quot; She rustled for her 
clothes and cigarettes. &quot;Damn it&quot;, she whispered.

&quot;You&#39;re over reacting. I was just asking because-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not over reacting!&quot; Kozue swiftly removed herself and the door 
slammed behind her.

Juri stared into the darkness for a few minutes, then quietly got out 
of bed and flicked on the light. Her eyes squinted against the 
brightness but soon adjusted. She padded over to her bathroom stopping 
to pick up a maroon pack of cigarettes. She held the pack to her nose 
and inhaled the scent, burnt spice.

The shower started running after a few beats of muffled milling about 
and beneath the sound was the lost almost non existent sob, &quot;Because I 
worry.&quot;

One day
You&#39;ll say
This was a mistake
The biggest you&#39;d had to make
And if you start to cry
Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s a lie
Cos this wasn&#39;t real
This love you made me feel

The foil punished the air around her in quick thrusts and brutal 
slices. Had anyone been on the receiving end of her sword that person 
would have found himself swiftly beaten into the ground. It wasn&#39;t her 
style to fence with such unrelenting force. Juri usually preferred to 
lead her opponent in a dance but when she was upset she had little 
time for mercy which was why she was practicing alone and far away 
from her teammates.

She was fencing the shadows and as usual the shadows were winning. 
Juri paused briefly enough for the observer behind her to touch her 
shoulder. She turned with a start to stare down into violet eyes.

&quot;Juri?&quot; The girl could see the panther trying to focus. &quot;Juri, Ruka 
want&#39;s to know if everyone can leave early.&quot;

Hazel eyes shut and then opened, &quot;Why?&quot;

The girl swallowed, &quot;The um&#133; the party that the chairman is holding-&quot;

&quot;They can leave early then&quot;, she started to turn so she could go on 
fighting the shadows but a petite hand caught her. &quot;What?&quot;

The girl huffed, &quot;I think you need to stop practicing and hit the 
showers.&quot;

&quot;Last I looked you weren&#39;t the team captain.&quot;

&quot;No, but last I looked you had a much better attitude. Do you have to 
get this way whenever things don&#39;t work out your way?&quot; 

Juri&#39;s eyes were dark, as if she were going to unleash hell upon the 
girl speaking to her, but then her shoulders rolled forward and she 
sighed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Shiori.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d be less sorry if you&#39;d listen to me. Take a shower, cool off 
and come to the party.&quot;

&quot;What are you going as?&quot;

Shiori giggled, &quot;Something you&#39;d find appropriate after what happened 
between us last year. &quot; She paused and then tilted her head in 
consideration, &quot;You know Juri I had always hoped you would hang onto 
your heart a little longer before giving it away again.&quot;

&quot;And I had always hoped that you&#39;d be the only to have it. Some 
miracles aren&#39;t meant to be granted.&quot;

&quot;And some are closer than you think they are. Go to the party Juri. 
Try to have a good time and take the chance to dance with someone.&quot;

Shiori wandered off to the showers and it didn&#39;t take long for Juri to 
heed the advice given and follow suit. She passed an old friend along 
the way. He smiled at her and she nodded back. In that moment she 
could hear him say what he always said when she felt as she did, 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Why worry?&quot;

My heart is cool
After the fire you extinguished
It is soft and fragile
All but ash in the after glow
A cinder that could spark
Or fade to nothing
And I wonder blindly
If it is truly dead
Or if it is but waiting
For you to set it alight again

The masquerade was set in the old Ohtori mansion; a place used to 
little life suddenly filled to excess. There was music and champagne, 
dancing and party games in nearly every room. The costumes were the 
sort of extravagance one would expect in movie, full of glitter, gold, 
sparkling fabrics and grotesquely beautiful leather masks.

She had been skirting the edges of the party since the beginning. Blue 
eyes peering out from behind a black leopard mask, assessing and 
collecting all she wanted to know. Guessing who was behind each 
disguise and generally being right on target. 

Kozue found that while the party wasn&#39;t enough to put her to sleep it 
was still rather dull, too civilized and controlled. There weren&#39;t 
enough people taking their beastly costumes to heart. And there were 
throngs of various animals and mythical creatures, angels, 
butterflies, kittens, frogs, an assortment of knights, there was even 
a prince and princess.

She watched the two for a long time, eternal happiness or eternal 
pain? There was a sad look in both girls&#39; eyes when she handed them 
the invitation. As if the world were ending and crashing all around 
them, leaving them separate and alone. She wondered why that was. 
Obviously it was to do with the chairman but&#133; She shook her head. It 
wasn&#39;t her business, or place to care. 

As the evening began to linger on Kozue went in search of a quiet 
place to sit. Her feet took her down an empty hallway filled with 
dusty antiques and furniture covered with sheets. Instinct brought her 
to a room filled with the pale light of candles and it was there that 
she decided to stay.

There was a mystery about the room since all the others down the 
corridor were shut up and unused. But despite the oddity the room was 
very inviting. The soft light flickered reflecting off the gold leaf, 
and embroidered sofas; a rosewood cabinet sat neatly in a corner glass 
doors revealing crystal brandy bottles and fresh glasses. An 
unintrusive mural was left cracked and slightly peeled on the far wall 
depicting two unhappy lions hovering over a pile of golden apples.

Kozue looked over the room quickly, then stole a small glass of brandy 
from the cabinet and relaxed into a sofa. Her eyes regarded the mural 
with modest interest as the first taste of the brandy hit her pallet, 
apricot. The only thing missing was a cigarette but her last pack was 
presumably lost amid the clutter of Juri&#39;s bedroom floor. The wild 
girl tired to convince herself she could live without them.

After a good ten minutes Kozue was well on her way to pouring her 
third small glass of brandy, when the decisive sound of good leather 
boots echoing down the hallway made her curve her attention. Once she 
was certain whom it was she shrugged, pulled out another glass and 
concluded pouring her drink.

&quot;Want one?&quot; She glanced over her shoulder at the elegant devil 
standing in the doorway.

He grinned beneath his cherubically horned mask, &quot;Of course.&quot; He sat 
on the sofa and asked, &quot;Is it your habit to take without asking?&quot;

Kozue picked up the crystal glasses and sauntered over to the lounging 
devil. Offered out a glass and answered when he reached for it, &quot;I 
take what I know will be offered.&quot;

&quot;Not enjoying the party?&quot; 

&quot;Too tame.&quot; She moved to a chair opposite the couch, closer to the 
mural. 

&quot;Too bad.&quot; He sipped his drink, amber liquid gracing lips that many 
thought beautiful, but were in fact poison.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you at your party Mr. Ohtori?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve misplaced my bride.&quot;

&quot;What, that blonde? What&#39;s her name? The self important one who dotes 
on your every move?&quot;

&quot;Kanae.&quot; 

&quot;Lost her have you? I&#39;d think you couldn&#39;t escape.&quot; She crossed her 
legs and pulled her mask back so it rested on her head. She wanted to 
think he was going to answer her honestly but instead he merely 
grinned.

&quot;I suppose&#133; I&#39;ve lost that bride as well.&quot; His green eyes narrowed 
behind his mask briefly before he asked, &quot;Do I still owe you a favor?&quot;

&quot;You might.&quot; Kozue tried to look disinterested, eyes looking up into 
the pained face of a lion.

&quot;Interesting isn&#39;t it&quot;, he said smoothly. &quot;The lions?&quot;

&quot;They look miserable with their treasure.&quot;

&quot;They are.&quot; He stood and took his glass over to the cabinet setting it 
down gently and then turning his attentions back to Kozue stated, 
&quot;They were once humans. Lovers punished by the gods to spend eternity 
as lions.&quot;

&quot;What did they do to upset the gods&quot;, she asked with a subtle warning 
growl. She felt as if she were being threatened.

&quot;They defiled a temple. Gods have never been known to approve of 
mortals having fun in sacred places.&quot;

She shrugged, &quot;At least they&#39;re together. Better life together as 
beasts than nothing at all.&quot;

His chuckle was a menacing comfort. &quot;Ah but you see the culture this 
myth is derived from believed that lions could only mate with 
leopards. Truly a poetic punishment then.&quot; Even with the mask on he 
looked smug, a little too proud of the information he had just 
relayed. But he was not one to brag. He knew when to make his exit. &quot;I 
should find my bride. Careful not to over indulge on the brandy Miss 
Kaoru.&quot;

Kozue did not find his sense of humor at all endearing. She could 
hazard a million guesses as to what he was alluding to but she didn&#39;t 
want any of them to be true or possible. 

I run in a line
Of illusion and myth
A something sweet
The kill of a kiss
And deep in the dark
Were my heart used to be
Is a siren singing in a thick black sea
It calls to the moon and the wolf and the crow
It calls for rest, for relief, a place to go
And in the end when all is lost
I find the damage hardly worth the cost
So trip up lightly to my shores
Plant a flag, burrow deep, make me wish for more

She dug through the crowds to the front door. Stepping outside and 
feeling relief at the cool air around her. Beneath her mask she was 
flushed from a torrent of dancing and one too many glasses of 
champagne. A quick breath left her as she pulled her mask off her face 
and quickly took a seat on the cold marble steps leading up to the 
house.

She held the black and gold lion mask in her hands. Hazel eyes 
regarding the fa&ccedil;ade with bruised contempt. She didn&#39;t know that she 
could bend to such obvious expectations. The door opened behind her 
and a breath of relief was offered up to the night by the new escapee, 
whom smelled of spice.

&quot;Do you have a cigarette&quot;, a familiar female voice asked hopefully.

Juri never liked coincidences, but she would concede to the one before 
her. She reached into her pocket and held up a maroon pack of 
cigarettes. The girl behind her took one out of the pack and waited as 
Juri retrieved a lighter. The fencer felt the girl bend down to light 
the cigarette the sudden burst of smoldering spice filling the air 
around her.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; It was said without meaning.

&quot;You could keep the pack&quot;, Juri said. &quot;I&#39;m not really a smoker.&quot;

Juri didn&#39;t turn around to see what the girl&#39;s reaction would be.

&quot;Arisugawa don&#39;t you ever get fed up with being polite?&quot;

&quot;No. Besides there are many who&#39;d argue I&#39;m rather rude.&quot;

There was a sniff and then the girl took a seat next to her. Juri 
looked over the costume she was wearing. Everyone seemed to be dressed 
so appropriately, Shiori was a butterfly, Ruka was an angel, Tenjou 
was a prince and now Kozue was next to her dressed as a leopard. 

A random fact spilled from Juri&#39;s lips; &quot;Panthers are leopards you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; 

&quot;Leopards born without spots&#133; &quot; She shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I pried 
that evening.&quot; 

Kozue clicked her tongue and silence washed in and then away, &quot;Juri I 
can&#39;t promise not to play and you know it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fair enough but let me ask&#133; have you since we&#39;ve started 
seeing each other?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, she whispered bewilderment in her tone. 

They looked at each then, through the dark night air, hazel eyes 
calling to blue and not knowing if there would ever be an answer back.

Kozue stood up; &quot;I don&#39;t want to love you.&quot;

 &quot;I don&#39;t want to love you either. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been given 
much of a choice in the matter.&quot;

&quot;So where does that leave us?&quot;

Juri shrugged and stood up. She started walking down the stairs. There 
was a hesitant step from behind her followed by a confident stride. 

There is no chain &#39;round my neck
No gilded cage to keep me prisoner
Were I wander I wander on my own
And whether you want to follow
I will leave to you
I am not called or pulled by force
In your direction
There is no master waiting to reward my deeds
I play in forests, the jungles, the swamps
I wait for no one to join me
I ask for no mate
But you come by and by
Stalk close to my hunting grounds
Take a moment to read my signs
Nudge me gently so I might wake
And we are free to leave when we should like
But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going
No, not ever
Especially this night
