<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 7 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri awoke to the sound of footsteps behind her. During the 
night, she had fallen asleep in a waiting room easy chair. With a 
short yawn, she turned her head to see a black-clad woman walking by. 
Woman...? 

&quot;Himemiya...Anthy? Is...that you?&quot; She quickly stood up and went after 
her, accidentally waking up Wakaba, who then sat up and rubbed her 
eyes.

&quot;Huh...? What&#146;s going on? Sempai?&quot; Wakaba&#146;s head suddenly shot up over 
the back of the couch and watched as Juri caught up with Anthy. 
&quot;Who...Himemiya-san?&quot; Across the way, Juri curiously peered at the 
nearly unrecognizable Hanayome.

&quot;Himemiya-san, why are you here?&quot;

&quot;Please, sempai, don&#146;t tell Shintaro-sama that I came to see her! 
Please!&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Juri, for once, looked dumbfounded. &quot;Why would I tell that 
irresponsible jerk anything?&quot;

&quot;You won&#146;t tell?&quot;

&quot;Of course not! Now, how did you know to come here?&quot;

&quot;I heard the explosion last night. It occurred shortly after 
Shintaro-sama left the dorm. I just had a dreadful feeling about it 
and thought I should find out. Unfortunately, he&#146;s forbidden me to see 
or think about her.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re going against your fate, aren&#146;t you?&quot; Anthy&#146;s purple locks 
draped around her face as she lowered her head, almost looking as if 
she were ashamed.

&quot;I...I had to know. I had to sneak out during the late hours. I got 
here and they said it was her and I had to see her.&quot;

&quot;Are you positive that Keingo-kun is behind this?&quot; Juri was positive, 
herself, but a little reassurance wouldn&#146;t hurt none. 

&quot;The facts are all there. He never leaves so late at night.&quot; Anthy 
stuttered a moment, seeing dreadful flashbacks as to why he never left 
at night. His evenings were spent in self-pleasure. How sickeningly 
violent he was, too. The Bride&#146;s slender arm crossed over her chest 
protectively as she shuddered.

&quot;Himemiya-san, what&#146;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Ah...nothing...I&#146;m fine...&quot; The golden-locked captain could see 
the remorseful, far away look in the girl&#146;s eyes, one she had seen on 
Utena&#146;s face. This poor girl was suffering, somehow.

&quot;Oh, you were saying...?&quot; The Bride&#146;s eyes snapped back to attention, 
quickly shaking off the flashbacks.

&quot;Oh, yes...sorry. I was saying that he never left so late. It wasn&#146;t 
only a coincidence that something like that bombing would occur 
shortly after his departure.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Juri&#146;s long fingers cradled her chin thoughtfully, 
considering the facts. &quot;He leaves for the first time in a long while 
after his usual hours; the explosion occurs thereafter. Utena was the 
only individual present at the scene. This was no coincidence. That 
bastard targeted her!&quot; 

&quot;Y...you believe me!?&quot;

&quot;It makes so much sense! How can I not!? I must report this to the 
Seitokai, immediately.&quot; The Bara no Hanayome&#146;s eyes suddenly went wide 
with fear.

&quot;W...wait!! If you tell...he...he&#146;ll know I went out. Punished or not, 
he&#146;s still the Kettou no Shioushia and I&#146;m still his 
&#145;prize&#146;...sempai...please...&quot; Arisugawa Juri did promise not to tell, 
but it was the only proof. 

&quot;Damn...either way one of you gets hurt. All right. I&#146;ll figure out 
something else, I hope.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, thank you so much, sempai. Besides, it&#146;ll give Utena-sama time to 
heal if he doesn&#146;t know that she&#146;s okay.&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s okay!?&quot;

&quot;Of course...I spoke with her before I left.&quot; Before another word 
could be exchanged, the sound of breaking glass was heard in the 
distance as Shinohara Wakaba bolted down the hallway, bound for 
Utena&#146;s room.

&quot;Umm...perhaps I shouldn&#146;t have said that quite so loud.&quot; The fencing 
captain&#146;s hand covered her face in mock annoyance.

&quot;It&#146;s quite all right. Shinohara-san loves Utena-sama like a sister. 
It&#146;s better that she knows. And anyway, she needs a good pick-me-up. 
Who better to do so than Shinohara-san, right?&quot;

&quot;I suppose you have a point.&quot; Anthy&#146;s smile suddenly disappeared after 
glancing to a wall clock.

&quot;Sempai...I apologize, but, I have to return to the dormitory before 
Shintaro-sama finds me missing.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Juri smiled, placing a creme-colored hand to Anthy&#146;s 
shoulder. &quot;For Utena-san&#146;s sake, please take good care of yourself.&quot;

&quot;I will, sempai. Until we meet again...&quot; Then, the mysterious Anthy 
exited, leaving Juri slightly bewildered.

&quot;How I feel for her. Is there no believable miracle that can set her 
free, for Utena is still recovering.&quot; With a sigh, she walked down the 
halls.

Inside the Planetarium, or better known as the Rijichou Shitsu, of the 
Ohtori Gakuen Observation Tower, Ohtori Akio sat behind a desk, pen in 
hand, impatiently filling out the financial papers concerning the 
bombing of the gymnasium. Each paper receiving his signature and then 
being filed, but...

&quot;What&#146;s this? An accident form? I thought the gymnasium was closed at 
that hour? Who could have...&quot; Reading further, he came across the name 
he&#146;d hoped he wouldn&#146;t. &quot;Tenjou Utena?? Impossible! I told Shintaro to 
get her out of the way, not kill her!!&quot; Standing quickly, he ran to 
the dorm next to his dwelling and barged through the door, eyes 
scanning for a certain boy who had some explaining to do. &quot;What&#146;s 
going on here? Tea...?&quot; Akio&#146;s hand grasped the cup and brought it to 
his nose, taking in the scent of a familiar supplement. &quot;Drugged. Must 
have been Anthy. She&#146;s not around.&quot; Taking the boy by the hair, he 
jerked upward, waking him right away.

&quot;Hey!! What the hell&#146;s the matter with...ah...Akio-san? Wha...what&#146;re 
you doing here?&quot; 

&quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; Akio spoke calmly, yet with a tone 
that showed obvious irritation. Shintaro&#146;s face looked slightly 
confused as Akio&#146;s hand released his hair.

&quot;Huh? What&#146;re you talking about?&quot;

&quot;The bombing. What did you hope to accomplish?&quot;

&quot;Geez! You wanted her out of the way didn&#146;t you!?&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re not hearing me, boy. I wanted her temporarily out of the way, 
not permanently.&quot; 

&quot;She&#146;s not dead...I saw it last night. Shinohara Wakaba was with her. 
I&#146;m sure she&#146;s fine...in a coma...but fine.&quot;

&quot;For your sake, she&#146;d better be. Without her, there&#146;s no way to obtain 
Dios no Chikara and this will all have been for naught.&quot; The Rijichou 
turned away, looking about the cluttered room. &quot;It&#146;s a mess in 
here...where&#146;s Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Anthy? Huh...she was...well....where the hell is she!?&quot; Akio&#146;s face 
suddenly turned back to the boy, angered to an extent.

&quot;You are hopeless! I knew she did it. I found you passed out at the 
table with a drug in your drink. She must have run off!&quot;

&quot;Last night...? That stupid little...!!&quot; Speak of the Devil. At that 
time, Anthy walked through the door. &quot;You! You left me last night, 
didn&#146;t you!?&quot; 

&quot;I just went out for awhile. I...couldn&#146;t sleep over your loud 
snoring.&quot; Keingo wasn&#146;t exactly amused, Akio, on the other hand, 
stifled a laugh.

&quot;You drugged my tea and deliberately disobeyed my! I know you went to 
see her last night!&quot;

&quot;Her? &#145;Her&#146; who? I&#146;m very sorry, but I don&#146;t know who &#145;her&#146; is.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t play stupid with me! Admit it!!&quot; Anthy suddenly began to have 
flashbacks with each loud outburst he threw at her, every one of them 
producing an image all pertaining to the suffering of her beloved 
Utena. The cuts, the bruises, the burns, the blood, and...the scar. 
For the first time, Himemiya Anthy&#146;s composure went, *snap*.

&quot;I can&#146;t do this, anymore. I don&#146;t know how much more I can take! 
Admit it? Admit what!? That you are a weak and incompetent liar that 
had to cheat in the game of Revolution to gain victory? That you&#146;re 
violent and abusive to not only your title and myself, but to 
Utena-sama, as well!? That you lied to the Seitokaichou!? That you 
tried to kill Utena-sama!?&quot; Anthy&#146;s head whipped around, her velvet 
locks following like a wave, and faced her brother, visibly outraged. 
&quot;Onii-sama...you can&#146;t let him get away with this, you can&#146;t!!&quot; 

&quot;Anthy...there isn&#146;t much I can do. Shintaro-kun is Kettou no 
Shioushia by call of the Sekai no Hate. The only way I could enforce 
his punishment...is if he were defeated and stripped of his title.&quot;

&quot;Then...Utena-sama will defeat him and he&#146;ll get what he deserves.&quot;

&quot;Anthy, I can&#146;t have that. My plan is working and with a new twist. I 
won&#146;t even have to take advantage of your beloved Prince, either. You 
may even benefit from it, yourself.&quot;

&quot;I...I don&#146;t understand.&quot; Akio&#146;s face lit up in satisfaction. Taking 
Anthy by her arm, he began to pull her along with him, then he stopped 
for a moment, looking back to his &#145;apprentice&#146;.

&quot;Shintaro-kun...I&#146;ll base your personal well-being of this incident on 
Utena&#146;s condition.&quot; Once again, he began to pull the Bride behind him, 
a low chuckle escaping his twisted smile. &quot;Come along, Anthy...it&#146;s 
time I paid my respects to the &#145;Bara no Oji-sama&#146; in her time of 
healing.&quot; 

Once more, Tenjou Utena&#146;s infirmary room was occupied with visitors, 
only, these ones were looking for answers.

&quot;...and that&#146;s what happened.&quot; Shinohara Wakaba and Arisugawa Juri 
listened intently as Utena, still tired and weak, told them about what 
had happened the night prior.

&quot;Utena-sama, I&#146;m sorry, I should have known someone as stubborn as you 
would go against a doctor&#146;s orders. This game of Revolution is really 
hard on you, isn&#146;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it is. I just...wait! How did you know...about...? Wakaba...?&quot; 
The hazel eyed girl looked sympathetically to her bed-ridden best 
friend and sighed.

&quot;Yeah. Himemiya-san took me to the Kettou Hiroba and she explained 
everything to me, about your duels and how they came about.&quot;

&quot;She...did? So, you know everything, now?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. I thought a lot about it, too.&quot;

&quot;...w...what...did you think about?&quot;

&quot;I...well...oh, Utena-sama! This is all my fault!!&quot; The girl cried 
out, bursting into shamed tears. 

&quot;What!? No, no, no, Wakaba...&quot;

&quot;It is! Anthy-san told me that you challenged Saionji-sempai because 
you were trying to avenge me! It was all a mistake! You wouldn&#146;t even 
be here like this if it hadn&#146;t been for me!&quot; 

&quot;Wakaba-chan...please don&#146;t cry. It&#146;s not your fault, it never was. 
C&#146;mon, please?&quot; Utena looked to the girl who still cried, a pained 
expression on her face. &quot;Come here...&quot; Wakaba sat down and leaned into 
Utena&#146;s embrace. &quot;Sshh...it&#146;s okay...it is..&quot; Utena&#146;s chin rested upon 
Wakaba&#146;s head, her arm around her, comfortingly. Next to them, Juri 
still sat. 

&quot;Do you want me to go, Utena?&quot;

&quot;No, no, sempai...she&#146;ll be okay. You can stay.&quot; Juri nodded slowly.

&quot;By the way, I never had a chance to ask how you were feeling.&quot; Utena 
smiled mentally to herself before looking up to answer the question.

&quot;To be blunt, sempai, like roadkill twice run over.&quot; A toothy, 
lop-sided smile spread on Utena&#146;s face at her comment.

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; The corners of the fencer&#146;s lips turned up at the remark. 
&quot;Well, it&#146;s nice to know you haven&#146;t lost your sense of humor.&quot; The 
Prince merely nodded and smiled. That much was true. She looked down 
to Wakaba, who was merely smiling back at her.

&quot;You okay, now?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, a little. I still feel bad.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#146;t. I had the chance to get out of this long ago, but I 
chose not to because this was my big opportunity to become the prince 
I set out to be, and protecting Himemiya gave me that chance, so I 
stayed in the game.&quot;

&quot;I guess, but you know what I mean.&quot; 

&quot;Well, you say what you want, but I&#146;ll never blame you for any of 
this. In some way, I should thank you. If you hadn&#146;t picked Saionji as 
such a lousy choice for a crush, I probably wouldn&#146;t have met 
Himemiya.&quot; Wakaba&#146;s eyes widened.

&quot;Utena-sama! I can&#146;t believe you said that! You&#146;re so cruel!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, hey, I was just kidding. I always kid you.&quot; To top that off, 
Utena flashed that smile that Wakaba simply could not resist: The 
Noble Prince&#146;s smile.

&quot;I...I know you were! I...I was just going along with it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, were you now? I guess you know me pretty well, don&#146;t you?&quot; Wakaba 
smiled triumphantly, her chest puffing out in pride.

&quot;I most certainly do! I know everything there is to know about 
Utena-sama!&quot; Utena merely arched an eyebrow before placing her hands 
on Wakaba&#146;s sides before a grin pulled one side of her mouth up.

&quot;...everything...?&quot; The Oji placed her face close to her now blushing 
friend&#146;s own.

&quot;Ah, Utena-sama, se...sempai is watching...&quot;

&quot;...so? Let her...&quot; Wakaba&#146;s heart beat rapidly in her chest. What was 
going on here?? 

&quot;...Utena...sama...&quot; The frosted pink of Utena&#146;s lips were mere inches 
from Wakaba&#146;s own...then...the smaller girl erupted in a childish fit 
of laughter, squirming helplessly underneath the prince&#146;s cruel 
fingers which were torturing her sides. &quot;Hey...qu...quit it!! 
Utena-sama, it tickles, c&#146;mon!! Stoooop iiiiiiiit!!&quot; 

&quot;You still sure you know everything!?&quot; 

&quot;Okay, okay! I give! I don&#146;t know everything!&quot; Utena&#146;s &#145;attack&#146; then 
ceased, another lopsided grin on her face. 

&quot;Did you really think I was gonna kiss you?&quot; Wakaba was still blushing 
profusely.

&quot;N...no...of course not! Utena-sama...I was...that wasn&#146;t fair!&quot; Utena 
then started laughing. Beside the two girls, Juri just smiled and 
shook her head.

&quot;You really are a tease, Utena-san.&quot; The room then went silent, Utena 
staring blankly at the grinning captain.

&quot;Oh, thanks a lot, sempai...I mean it, really.&quot; Utena muttered, 
smugly. Suddenly, Wakaba stood up, pinching Utena&#146;s cheek before 
walking to the door.

&quot;Ah, Wakaba-chan...where are you going?&quot; 

&quot;I&#146;m going out to collect the homework you&#146;ve missed.&quot; She replied, a 
sadistic smile playing it&#146;s way onto her features.

&quot;My wha...!? Wha...what for!?&quot; 

&quot;Wouldn&#146;t want you falling behind in your classes, now would we?&quot;

&quot;You truly are cruel, Wakaba-chan...&quot; 

&quot;Payback sucks, doesn&#146;t it?&quot; Juri said as Utena bowed her head in 
defeat when Wakaba disappeared out the door, a small laugh ringing in 
the hallway.

&quot;Awww...homework? It&#146;s not fair! I&#146;m sick!&quot; Juri stood from her seat, 
finally, and walked to the ailing Utena, a humored expression on her 
face.

&quot;Oh, poor, poor Utena-san. I hate to be honest, but it sucks to be 
you.&quot;

&quot;Se...sempai! That was blunt!&quot; Juri just laughed lightly. &quot;Hmph, I 
guess I deserved that. At least she isn&#146;t sad, anymore.&quot; After that, 
the conversation became silent. Juri took the chance to sit on the 
edge of Utena&#146;s bed, her ringed hand toying with a sheet. 

&quot;Since you were so upset last time I saw you, I didn&#146;t ask, but how 
did you take seeing that...scar?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that? I was pretty upset when I first saw it. I was afraid that 
Himemiya would forever blame herself for all of this whenever she saw 
it. Naturally, I was right. After a lot of persuasion, I convinced her 
it wasn&#146;t her fault.&quot;

&quot;Is she okay, now?&quot;

&quot;Well, I believe so. When she was here, she didn&#146;t really pay much 
attention to it at all. Speaking of being here, she was risking a lot 
doing so.&quot; 

&quot;She certainly was. I talked with her earlier. It seems the Victor 
she&#146;s with isn&#146;t exactly innocent. What happened while she was with 
you?&quot; The young Prince was silent for a moment. What had happened 
before she woke up? Considering a moment longer, she began.

&quot;I was comatose in the beginning. I don&#146;t know much of what happened 
then. I do remember a dream. A dream about being alone in a black void 
as a child. I felt scared and lonely as I cried. The next thing I 
know, Himemiya&#146;s standing before me. When she knelt down, she dried my 
tears and began to ask me some things. But then, she had convinced the 
dream-me that it was the part of me that made up my noble mind. 
Apparently, everything that has happened really made an impact on my 
nobility and it began diminishing, slowly. Each question I answered, I 
felt as though I was regaining my noble heart and mind, while my child 
form aged to my current one. After that, I awoke in her arms.&quot; Having 
listened carefully, Juri nodded and embraced the prince, a sigh 
leaving her.

&quot;I&#146;m glad you were able to find yourself. Welcome back, Utena.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, sempai.&quot; Upon parting, they stayed silent, almost 
uncomfortably. What was left to say now? Juri&#146;s azure eyes suddenly 
hardened as she looked to Utena once more.

&quot;Now, that you&#146;re up and conscious, your rehabilitation begins 
tomorrow. I&#146;ll be here to get you in the morning, so get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;You will? How come?&quot;

&quot;I am not letting you out of my sight until all&#146;s well. So, I hope 
you&#146;re tolerant of me, because you&#146;ll be spending the next week under 
my watchful eye.&quot; Utena&#146;s jaw dropped slightly and her eyebrow 
twitched, nervously.

&quot;Ah...heh heh...gee, thanks...Arisugawa-sempai...&quot;

Author&#146;s gibberish:

Ahhh, that was great fun...ah, that it was. *sings horribly off-key to 
the conga line song* Anthy got a back-BONE, Anthy got a back-BONE, 
Anthy got a back-BONE! Yeah, I just got sick and damn tired of seeing 
her being so submissive, dag-nabbit! What can I say? A little OOC, but 
it&#39;s fiction for a reason ^^;</pre>
