Setsuna smiled slightly to herself as she walked up to the familiar 
front of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Over the past few months it had become a 
comforting constant in her life, and since she began dating Juri 
herself it was almost a second home to her. The dark haired woman 
nodded to Bones and asked, &quot;How are you doing this evening?&quot;

The black haired bouncer smiled slightly. &quot;It&#39;s been pretty quiet so 
far,&quot; Bones reported, &quot;a couple underage attempts to sneak in, a few 
drag artists, that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;Do you have anything planed for Saturday night?&quot; Setsuna asked.

Bones raised an eyebrow, &quot;Other than being here, no.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s coming up to the anniversary of the grand opening of the 
Locket,&quot; Setsuna explained, &quot;and I&#39;d like to see if we can get a 
celebration going.&quot;

&quot;Count me in,&quot; Bones nodded crisply, &quot;I owe Arisugawa big time.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Setsuna smiled, &quot;just don&#39;t tell Juri. I want it to be a 
surprise.&quot;

With that Setsuna stepped inside, making her way down the dark hallway 
to the inside of the converted warehouse. She paused there in the 
entrance, taking in the dance floor, dining tables, bar, library and 
the stairways up to the second floor and the row of private rooms 
there.

&quot;Good evening, Setsuna,&quot; Hitomi smiled up at her. The brown haired 
greeter persisted in wearing her school girl&#39;s uniform, despite having 
graduated years ago.

&quot;How&#39;s university going?&quot; Setsuna asked curiously.

Hitomi smiled, &quot;I aced the last few tests, luckily.&quot; She hesitated, 
&quot;Thanks for referring me to Ami for tutoring. I think I might have 
flunked, otherwise.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Setsuna smiled. &quot;I&#39;m going to try to give Juri a 
surprise party on Saturday,&quot; she said softly, &quot;to celebrate the one 
year anniversary of the Locket.&quot;

Hitomi beamed, &quot;I&#39;ll help however I can.&quot;

Cutting through the crowded dance floor Setsuna nodded her greetings 
to several regulars before breaking through the mob to the bar itself. 
A nice bar it was, too, with old fashioned &#39;L&#39; shaped bar top, lined 
by round stools and with a large space behind where Ryouko and Minagi 
worked. The twin space pirates were a sight to see, flamboyantly 
dandling the bottles and mixes to ready drinks for the appreciative 
audience.

&quot;Hey Setsuna,&quot; Ryouko&#39;s teeth flashed, &quot;you want us to let Juri know 
you&#39;re here?&quot;

&quot;Not just yet,&quot; Setsuna smiled back. &quot;Minagi, come over here too.&quot; 
Once both sisters were in front of her she said, &quot;We&#39;re coming up to 
the anniversary of the grand opening of the Locket, and knowing Juri 
like I do, she hasn&#39;t got anything planned.&quot;

&quot;So you wanna hold a party,&quot; Minagi grinned. At Setsuna&#39;s mildly 
surprised look she added, &quot;We were already thinking of doing something 
for her. You got a day in mind?&quot;

&quot;Saturday?&quot; Setsuna offered.

&quot;We&#39;ll be there,&quot; Ryouko nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll let Ayeka and a few others 
know.&quot;

Minagi smiled impishly, &quot;And I&#39;ll pass the word on to Sasami, maybe 
she can cook us up something, too.&quot;

&quot;Cook what?&quot; Arisugawa Juri asked as she came down from her office 
upstairs.

&quot;Something special for us,&quot; Setsuna smiled, taking her orange haired 
girlfriend&#39;s arm.

Sitting at one of the back tables the brown haired woman in the cream 
colored woman&#39;s suit tried to relax, her short skirt showing off long 
shapely legs as she scanned the crowd cautiously. Her redheaded 
companion looked around her with a cheerful smile, almost little girl 
like.

&quot;Lila,&quot; the brown haired woman remarked, &quot;I&#39;m not quite certain that&#39;s 
the correct expression for this situation.&quot;

Lila met her gaze, &quot;Would you prefer one of my other smiles, Najica?&quot;

Najica&#39;s own lips tugged upwards, &quot;I suppose not.&quot; She frowned 
slightly, &quot;I&#39;m beginning to think that fool sent us on a wild goose 
chase.&quot;

&quot;Goose chase?&quot; Lila echoed, the artificial girl sounding confused.

&quot;A futile pursuit,&quot; Najica explained, &quot;or pointless chase.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Lila nodded thoughtfully. She tilted her head, &quot;How do we go 
about examining the bottoms of our targets, Najica?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m exactly not sure,&quot; Najica sighed softly. &#39;What sort of creator 
puts the only identifying mark a humaritte has on it&#39;s bottom, 
anyway?&#39; she thought to herself irritably before quickly answering her 
own question, &#39;A pervert, that&#39;s who.&#39;

&quot;Hi there,&quot; Cyberdoll May beamed at them, looking cutely eager in her 
crisp maid&#39;s uniform, &quot;how can I help you?&quot;

Lila smiled innocently, &quot;Could I take a look at your panties?&quot;

There was a long moment of dead silence as Najica sweatdropped. &#39;I 
can&#39;t believe she asked that!&#39; she thought.

May blinked, &quot;Well, normally I&#39;d only allow my girlfriend, but...&quot; She 
looked over at Najica, &quot;Could you block, please?&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Najica managed while thinking dazedly, &#39;She may not be 
one of our targets, but I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s not human!&#39;

May bent over and her skirt went up, revealing white cotton panties. 
Covertly Lila scanned for the markings that would show her to be a 
humanlite, but nothing appeared. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lila beamed, &quot;they&#39;re 
very nice panties.&quot;

Once May took their order Najica whispered, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you did 
that!&quot;

Lila looked at her innocently, &quot;It was effective.&quot;

&quot;That may be true,&quot; Najica admitted, &quot;but you&#39;d best hope that her 
girlfriend doesn&#39;t find out you did that.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Lila blinked.

&quot;You&#39;ll find out,&quot; Najica smiled slightly. She shook her head, &quot;Now we 
just have to go check out this Mahoro, too.&quot;

Lila looked around them curiously as some of the patrons got up from 
the tables to dance. She looked over at Najica, &quot;Should we try to 
blend in?&quot;

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Najica offered Lila her hand.

The two women moved hand in hand onto the dance floor together, and 
Najica gently lead Lila through the dance. Looking down, Najica saw an 
unfamiliar smile on her companion&#39;s pretty face. She knew Lila had to 
practice all of her expressions, having been awakened only a short 
time ago, and she wondered how she had created this one.

&quot;What?&quot; Lila looked up to ask.

&quot;What number are you going to give that smile?&quot; Najica asked gently.

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Lila shook her head with that same gentle smile, &quot;I think 
I&#39;m going to call this my Najica smile. I only seem to have it when 
I&#39;m around you.&quot;

Najica blushed a bit, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

In another part of the Locket, Keiko was looking at May in shock. &quot;She 
asked you to do what?&quot; the boy&#39;s uniform clad woman asked.

&quot;What?&quot; May blinked. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d mind.&quot;

Keiko&#39;s eyes narrowed angrily, her brown braid swinging down her back, 
&quot;When I get my hands on her, I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Hold off on the vengeance for a bit,&quot; Tendo Nabiki said as she walked 
up to them. The dark haired woman asked, &quot;You two hear about the 
surprise party?&quot;

&quot;Hitomi told me,&quot; May said, still puzzling over what made Keiko so 
upset, &quot;right after she told Excel and Hyatt.&quot;

&quot;If I don&#39;t see her, pass it on to Setsuna that if there&#39;s any 
additional costs for this party, I&#39;ll cover them,&quot; Nabiki said 
crisply.

&quot;That&#39;s uncharacteristic of you,&quot; Keiko looked at her in surprise.

Nabiki grinned back at her, &quot;I&#39;m just building up some credit if 
another one of my schemes goes bad on me.&quot;

To be continued...

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami are from the series Tenchi Muyo. 
Keiko is also from Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Excel 
and Hyatt are from Excel Saga. Hitomi is from Escaflowne, the movie. 
Bones is from www.coolcatstudios.com. And finally, Tendo Nabiki is 
from Ranma 1/2.

Our Cast This Episode: Ami and Setsuna are both from Sailor Moon. And 
Lila and Najica are from Najica: Blitz Tactics.

Author&#39;s Notes: Najica Blitz Tactics is an enjoyable shoujo-ai series 
with only one glaring flaw: all the panty shots. There is an obsessive 
focus on panty shots, much like it&#39;s sister series, Agent Aika. But if 
you can get past all the panties, it&#39;s a pretty good anime. </pre>
