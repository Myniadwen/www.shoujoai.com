<a href="../utena/captain-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Shiori rose from the ground, a soft light building up all around her 
body. Soon, the pure white light swept every corner of the dungeon, 
searching for any trace of the dark magics that had once been worked 
there. Even Juri shivered softly as the light washed over her body, 
feeling almost like the brush of a gentle hand.

Floating up there, Juri thought Shiori looked almost like an angel. 
She had to laugh at that, thinking about how earthy the young woman 
had been with her last night. The glow slowly faded, and finally 
Shiori gently settled to the ground.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Shiori finally sighed softly.

&quot;Thank you for trying again,&quot; Juri said to her softly. Quietly, she 
added, &quot;There aren&#39;t any other traps hidden around here?&quot;

&quot;No, just the one in the cell we set off,&quot; Shiori growled softly. She 
glared towards the badly burnt cell, thinking how close of a call it 
had been for her.

Juri shrugged, and she actually smiled at Shiori as she said, &quot;Then I 
guess I&#39;ll just have to do this the hard way.&quot;

&quot;The hard way?&quot; the mage asked Juri softly, wrapping her coat around 
her.

Noticing the chill Juri put her arm over Shiori&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We know 
someone paid Ruka to go after Utena,&quot; Juri said. They began to walk 
out of the dungeon as Juri continued, &quot;We just have to trace the 
money, how he got it and where it came from.&quot;

&quot;Not easy, but doable,&quot; Shiori nodded. With a dark smile she added, &quot;I 
hope we find out who cast that trap, I&#39;d like to face them myself.&quot;



Kanae sneezed suddenly before taking a moment to wipe at her nose. 
&quot;Excuse me, please,&quot; the blushing woman said to Anthy and Utena. The 
Princess had issued a summons after breakfast, no reasons, just a 
command that she be here. And that annoying Captain was there, smiling 
at her like she knew something.

&quot;I never had the chance to offer my condolences after my brothers 
sudden... departure,&quot; Anthy said, taking a careful sip of her tea.

&#39;Departure,&#39; Kanae scowled internally, &#39;don&#39;t you mean his exile?&#39; But 
she didn&#39;t let any of her feelings show as she sweetly answered, &quot;I 
can certainly understand that, and I thank you for your kind wishes.&quot;

Speaking very casually, Utena asked her, &quot;Have you seen Akio since his 
exile?&quot;

Kanae hesitated a fraction bringing her cup to her lips. &quot;No, I 
haven&#39;t,&quot; she said sorrowfully, &quot;our separation has been terribly 
difficult on us both.&quot;

&quot;If you wish,&quot; Anthy offered pleasantly, &quot;I could break your 
engagement to him. It would free you from being bound to an exile like 
himself.&quot;

Kanae went visibly white at that. &quot;NO! No, thank you,&quot; she moderated 
her tone. &quot;Could I be excused, please?&quot; Kanae asked even as she got up 
out of her seat.

Anthy looked up at Utena carefully, who nodded slightly. &quot;Of course,&quot; 
Anthy said gently.

Kanae all but ran out of the room.

Almost as soon as the doors closed, Anthy doubled over in laughter. 
Utena chuckled as well, even though her expression was far more 
serious.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you wrote my words for me,&quot; Anthy chuckled, &quot;I doubt I could 
have managed that otherwise. You can be quite wicked when you want to 
be, my dear Utena.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena smiled down at her. &quot;I feel quite certain now that 
she remains in contact with your brother,&quot; she said with a nod.

&quot;Did we have to insult her as much as we did?&quot; Anthy asked Utena 
hesitantly. &quot;The long wait in the hall, all the leading comments,&quot; she 
shook her head, suddenly the noble lady troubled by matters of 
decorum.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Utena said gently. &quot;If she wasn&#39;t angry already, I doubt 
that she would have slipped up at all,&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war,&quot; Anthy quoted softly. She looked up at 
Utena, her expression much more firm, &quot;So what shall we do next?&quot;

&quot;Lunch,&quot; Utena answered with a smile, lightening the mood.

Anthy rolled her eyes. &quot;I mean about our afternoon guest, Saionji,&quot; 
she said, her hands on her hips as she started at Utena. She almost 
looked like the comic image of a housewife, and Utena had to fight 
back a smile.

&quot;I&#39;ll think of something,&quot; Utena finally gave up and grinned.

&quot;Lady preserve us,&quot; Anthy said as she dramatically threw her hand up 
to her brow. She pretended to be just about to faint, when her foot 
caught in the hem of her skirt and she found herself falling for real. 
But before she could hit the ground, strong arms caught her around the 
waist, holding her firmly.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Utena asked Anthy breathlessly, cradling her 
gently in her arms.

Anthy looked up at Utena&#39;s face, and felt like she was drowning in her 
blue eyes. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Anthy said, even as she became fascinated by 
Utena&#39;s lips. She reached up, gently grasping her, and then Anthy 
gently drew Utena down into a kiss.

Utena drew back, and Anthy felt her heart seize with fear. Then Utena 
bent close to kiss her back, gently but lingeringly. They drew apart, 
both of them slightly breathless.

&quot;Anthy, I never thought,&quot; Utena started, when Anthy reached up to 
gently place her finger over Utena&#39;s lips.

&#39;I&#39;m so glad that she didn&#39;t call me princess again,&#39; was the odd 
thought that bounced around Anthy&#39;s skull. &quot;Don&#39;t talk, please,&quot; Anthy 
said to her softly. She rose to her feet, then helped Utena stand up 
again. She looked searchingly into her eyes a moment, and then Anthy 
gently drew Utena towards the bedroom.



Juri unlocked Ruka&#39;s quarters with obvious reluctance. First, she had 
hesitated in front of the door for a few moments, and then she finally 
took several minutes looking through her ring of keys until she found 
the right one.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Shiori asked her softly.

Juri remained silent, before finally opening up the door. The spelled 
torches lit, lighting up the small set of rooms in a comforting glow. 
The front room had a couch, chair and a desk covered by piles of 
papers.

A picture caught Shiori&#39;s eye, and she walked over to pick it up. Juri 
and Ruka both stood smiling in their guard&#39;s uniforms, obviously 
friends and comrades. &quot;You knew him,&quot; Shiori said softly, looking up 
at Juri.

The duel between Juri and Ruka ran through Shiori&#39;s mind, and she 
shuddered at the idea of killing a close friend like that. 
&#39;Incredible,&#39; she thought, looking at Juri in a bit of awe. &#39;I could 
never do that,&#39; she admitted to herself.

Juri walked over to her side, looking down at the image sadly. &quot;We 
joined the guards together,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and became friends 
right away. All through our training we fought to be the best, and we 
graduated to the ranks of the royal guards together.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Shiori asked gently.

A slightly twisted smile appeared on Juri&#39;s face as she said &quot;I fell 
in love with my first lady. And Ruka had the great misfortune to fall 
for me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Shiori whispered, easily imagining how badly that sort of 
situation could turn out for either of them.

Juri nodded. &quot;He walked in on us together,&quot; she sighed, &quot;and took it 
very badly.&quot; She set the image down gently, &quot;He blamed me, said I&#39;d 
deceived him. He dropped out of sight, and the next time I met him was 
as the professional duelist.&quot;

&quot;Do you think he understood about you?&quot; Shiori asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Juri spoke softly, &quot;that&#39;s all that he said to me, after 
I struck the killing blow.&quot; She visibly shook herself, trying to drive 
away the troubling thoughts as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s take a look around, 
shall we?&quot;

Shiori accepted the change of subject. &quot;Shall I look over the desk?&quot; 
she asked, and received a nod from Juri. The papers were a mess, piled 
about randomly, but all were neatly written and quite legible. Shiori 
settled down and began to read even as Juri stalked the rooms like a 
cat.

Juri paused in the doorway if the bedroom, looking inside cautiously. 
The room was immaculate, everything neatly in it&#39;s place. A littler 
smile teased at Juri&#39;s lips as she saw that the bed sheets were folded 
just like a guard&#39;s quarters.

&#39;Wait a moment,&#39; Juri thought as a memory struck her. &#39;He wouldn&#39;t 
still?&#39; she wondered as she carefully made her way to the bed. She 
cautiously lifted up the mattress and saw the small wooden box hidden 
there, as she had expected, as well as something that she didn&#39;t: a 
neatly folded letter, addressed to her.

Juri carried the box in and set it by Shiori carefully. &quot;Could you 
exasmine this magically?&quot; she asked her, &quot;I think the money inside was 
handled by whoever hired Ruka.&quot;

&quot;How did you find it?&quot; Shiori asked, cupping her glowing hands around 
the little box.

&quot;A trick that Ruka and I came up with as guards,&quot; Juri said softly, 
&quot;we built a hidden compartment in our bed frames to hide things.&quot;

Shiori suddenly jerked her hands awayu from the box, her eyes wide. 
&quot;The energies around the box are necromantic!&quot; she exclaimed softly.

&quot;Necromantic?&quot; Juri demanded an explaination.

&quot;Dead,&quot; Shiori whispered softly. She looked up to meet Juri&#39;s eyes 
noting that they were probably about as wide as her own.



Saionji knocked again, a frown on his face. He swept his long green 
hair back, carefully checking if he was on time. &#39;What in the world&#39;s 
going on?&#39; he wondered.

Growing impatient, he banged on the door harder, and this time Saionji 
was rewarded with a response. Tenjou Utena pulled the door oipen a 
bit, but it was a Utena he had never seen before. Gone was the neat, 
controlled officer, this young woman was badly rumpled. Her shirt was 
part unbuttoned, and her hair was a mess.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Saionji,&quot; Utena said with a winning smile, &quot;it seems the 
princess is indisposed. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be able to see you tomorrow, 
though.&quot; And with that she simply slammed the door right in his face.

Saionji looked at the door a moment, then with a scowl started down 
the hall. A few steps away he stopped as an odd sound reached his 
ears: the princess&#39; giggle, followed by a soft moan. He stood there a 
moment, then with a shake of his head he walked away. </pre>
