<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 12 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/onceagain-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;So how did it go?&quot; Shinobu asked gently, the group
that had gathered in the caf&eacute; Hinata listening
eagerly. The younger girl delivered their drinks, her
short black hair gleaming as she sat down to join
them.

Anthy Himemiya gave her friends a wry look. &quot;Not bad,
actually,&quot; the purple haired young woman confessed,
&quot;Utena was surprised to see me, but we talked about
what happened between us.&quot;

&quot;And are you going to see her again?&quot; Kitsune asked,
grinning as she brought over some breakfast orders for
them. With her sandy hair and boyish look she was
quite handsome, but she seemed to rarely notice
others&#39; interest.

Anthy actually blushed faintly. &quot;She&#39;s promised to
visit me here,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I have her phone
number too.&quot;

Motoko nodded, the black haired swords woman looking
thoughtful. &quot;Good, I&#39;d like to meet her,&quot; she said,
&quot;to determine if she&#39;s worthy of you.&quot;

&quot;Playing big brother again?&quot; Kitsune teased.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Motoko agreed.

Kanako Urashima sighed softly, studying the intense
warrior for a moment. &#145;She&#39;s lovely,&#39; she admitted,
pulling her eyes away reluctantly.

Anthy gave her a sympathetic smile, pausing to drink
some of her tea. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she addressed Motoko,
&quot;but I doubt that&#39;ll be needed.&quot;

As the chime above the door rang out Tennyo Masaki
entered, her silvery white hair flowing gracefully.
&quot;Morning all,&quot; she smiled, heading by them to the main
counter, &quot;good morning, Mutsumi.&quot;

Mutsumi Otohime beamed as Tennyo walked up, the busty
brown haired woman calling out, &quot;Morning, Tennyo-san.
What can I get you?&quot;

&quot;My regular, thanks,&quot; Tennyo answered. She found
herself thinking of Kitsune&#39;s comment earlier and had
to agree, it did look like Mitsumi had a crush on her.
&#145;I just wish I knew what to do about it,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Mutsumi said as she cheerfully dropped
off the food then lingered to talk.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Tennyo asked as she nodded towards
where their fellow inn residents were gently grilling
Anthy.

&quot;It seems Anthy finally met her long lost sweetheart,&quot;
Mutsumi revealed excitedly, &quot;and it went pretty well.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad for her,&quot; Tennyo nodded as drank a bit then
munched through her breakfast. Looking at the other
girl curiously she asked, &quot;Has anyone else met this
paragon of virtue?&quot;

Mutsumi giggled, &quot;According to Su, she&#39;s no paragon.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Tennyo asked. Koalla Su was their resident mad
scientist and techno whiz, so it wasn&#39;t surprising
she&#39;d be able to find out a great deal about someone
if she wanted to. &#145;Besides, she&#39;s the type who&#39;d want
to look into a mystery like this,&#39; she mused.

&quot;It seems Miss Utena is quite the crusader, having
been arrested several times helping other people,&quot;
Mutsumi revealed, &quot;her file reads like a adventure
novel.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to ask Su if I can borrow it,&quot; Tennyo
chuckled.

Mutsumi hesitated a moment, &quot;I have it back at my
room,&quot; she said, &quot;you could stop by later to read it.&quot;

Tennyo blinked, wondering if this was a pass or a
friendly offer. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; she said, smiling
slightly.

&quot;I&#39;ll have it ready for you,&quot; Mutsumi said cheerfully,
only reluctantly moving off to help out another
customer.

Meanwhile, two young women tiredly made their way up
the steps to the Hinata Inn. &quot;I wonder how long it&#39;ll
take us to get used to this?&quot; Ami Mizuno puffed, the
blue haired girl pausing to rest.

Rei Hino took a deep breath, the black haired miko
looking nearly as tired as her companion. &quot;I don&#39;t
think you do get used to it,&quot; she grumbled tiredly,
&quot;you just learn not to show it to others.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ami admitted as they made themselves go up
the final set of stairs. &quot;How did training at the
shrine go?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;The old coots a fake,&quot; Rei admitted, &quot;but Kagome is
the real thing. We&#39;ve been exchanging demon fighting
methods for the last few days.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Ami asked, a slightly dangerous tone in
her voice.

Rei reached out to squeeze Ami&#39;s shoulder once they
began to walk across the flat top of the hill and
towards the Inn itself. &quot;Yeah, too bad her boyfriend
hangs around all the time.&quot; A bit teasingly she added,
&quot;You&#39;d think he didn&#39;t trust having a lesbian around
his girlfriend.&quot;

Ami blushed, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Rei admitted, &quot;I felt a few twinges
when I met your professor and found out she was a
babe.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s married,&quot; Ami blinked as they walked
through the main entrance and slipped out of their
shoes.

&quot;Jealousy does not understand logic,&quot; Rei answered,
passing Ami her slippers and putting her own on.

&quot;I&#39;ll try to remember that,&quot; Ami agreed.

&quot;Rei, Ami!&quot; Koalla Su exclaimed, the dusky skinned
blonde haired girl bounding down the hall, &quot;Anthy&#39;s
back!&quot;

&quot;Did her trip to Tokyo go well?&quot; Rei asked, fighting
back a smile at the young girl&#39;s nearly infinite
amounts of energy.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Su agreed, &quot;the others have her over at
the caf&eacute;, questioning her about it.&quot;

&quot;Poor Anthy,&quot; Ami looked amused.

Rei looked at Su curiously, &quot;So why aren&#39;t you over
there?&quot;

&quot;Akiko Taichi is over,&quot; Su explained, &quot;we&#39;re playing
deathmatch games for fun.&quot;

&quot;Well, I hope you enjoy yourselves,&quot; Ami said as Su
scampered off to get some snacks for her and her
friend.

&quot;That girl scares me at times,&quot; Rei confessed as she
slid open the door to their room, waving Ami through
first then following her in.

&quot;Was that before or after she tried to burn us with
the blowtorch?&quot; Ami wondered, setting her bags on the
desk.

&quot;Both,&quot; Rei chuckled, moving up behind Ami and
wrapping her arms around her.

&quot;Oooh, Rei...&quot; Ami murmured as she kissed the back of
Ami&#39;s neck.

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting all day for this,&quot; Rei murmured as
she squeezed gently, then nibbled Ami&#39;s ear.

&quot;What if someone comes by...?&quot; Ami gasped softly.

&quot;I bet questioning Anthy should keep most of them
busy,&quot; Rei slid her hands up to caress Ami&#39;s breasts.

Ami purred, arching her back. &quot;You are a bad girl,
Rei...&quot; she murmured happily.

Rei grinned, &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t want me any other way.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Should we really be watching this?&quot; Akiko asked as
they watched the feed from the spy camera Su had
planted on them. The brown haired girl&#39;s twin
ponytails bounced as she munched on the crackers Si
had brought them.

&quot;When are we going to have the chance to otherwise?&quot;
Su asked cheerfully.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Akiko blinked, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could bend
like that.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Su agreed, making notes.</pre>
