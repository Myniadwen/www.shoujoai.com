<p><strong>A/N:</strong> I was completely positive that &quot;Thorns&quot; was a one-shot.  I still am, which is why I am making this a separate story. &quot;Thorns&quot; is  complete in and of itself. But as I sat down at my computer to write  the 10th chapter of &quot;The Energy of Hidden Emotions&quot; I found myself  thinking... How would Utena cope with what had happened to her? Even  more than that I wondered, even as Utena does, &quot;Why, Anthy?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Go Read <u>Thorns</u> First!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Weeping Rose</p>
<hr />
<p>I could not stop thinking of that day.</p>
<p><em>A  rose on a thorny stem being drawn across my belly, making me squirm,  being pulled across my cotton underwear, the thorns catching lightly on  the material. Stroking across my bare inner thigh causing fear, pain,  and pleasure to collide in a way that scares me to my bones and coats  my underwear in arousal.</em></p>
<p>After I refused Anthy's offer to  &quot;end our engagement,&quot; and thereby allow me to leave the Tournament, I'd  gone down on my knee to give her my cheesy yet heartfelt speech wherein  I promised too much of myself.</p>
<p>Anthy hadn't said anything at all,  just stared at me with a look in her eye that encompassed shock, hope,  and sorrow together all at once. With nothing more to say, I had stood  up and as I did, she reached for me, her face drawing near to kiss me,  or hug me, or touch me in some way. But any touch from her at all was  too much and I had reared my head away.</p>
<p>&quot;No Anthy, not that.&quot;</p>
<p>She  had taken a step back from me, her face twitching as she tried to hold  back tears. I had to get away. I had wanted to pull her toward me, the  comfort her, to rain down kisses on her hair, but I also remembered</p>
<p><em>murmuring  &quot;no&quot; &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;please&quot; even as I cannot contain my gasps of pleasure,  telling her &quot;I do not consent,&quot; as she coats my lips in my own cum and  blood.</em></p>
<p>I fled our room.</p>
<p>I'd passed the empty halls full  of doorways that led to empty rooms and stridden out the front door of  the East Dormitory. I didn't know where I was going, only that I needed  to go somewhere that did not remind me of Anthy.</p>
<p>I'd found myself  standing in front of Wakaba's door. I had knocked, then waited. Nobody  came to the door, not even her roommate. After a while I had sighed, my  shoulders slumping, and turned to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;Utena!&quot; I'd heard the  shout and barely had time to brace myself for the slight figure of my  best friend colliding against me. Her arms had wrapped around me from  behind and squeezed me in a hug more powerful than you'd expect from a  girl her size. Finally she'd let go, and I'd turned to look at her. She  had been such good site to my eyes, my Onion Princess, that I could not  help but scoop her up in a bear hug of my own.</p>
<p>&quot;Utena! It's so good to see you, I was just thinking about you, did you know that there are <em>boys </em>in  your old room? I went there on accident the other day, you know from  habit even though you haven't lived there in a long time and I knocked  on the door and <em>boys</em> opened the door. I was so surprised because...&quot;</p>
<p>It  had been so good to hear her voice that I found myself shuddering with  relief and then I was crying, sobbing even, in Wakaba's surprised arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot;  I'd heard her say, her arms stroking my back soothingly, &quot;Could you  make yourself absent for a little while?&quot; I'd look up and seen her  roommate standing awkwardly a couple feet away. She had nodded then  said, &quot;Can I grab my books first? I was planning on studying in the  Library anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>I had stood at the door and attempted to control  my sobs as Wakaba and I waited outside of her room for her roommate to  finish collecting her things. As she left their room, she had placed an  arm on my shoulder and looked at me seriously. &quot;I don't know what's  wrong, but something I do when I'm feeling like nothing will ever be  right is think, well, at least it's not the end of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>I  can't help it. I laughed. I had started laughing so hard that tears  were falling down my cheeks, and I was holding my belly. Wakaba's  roommate (whose name I never really got around to learning) had  shrugged and looked at Wakaba.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I didn't think that was so funny.&quot;</p>
<p>Wakaba  shrugged as well, then taken my arm and drawn me into the room with  her. By then I was hiccupping, so Wakaba poured me some water in a  glass cup from her bathroom, then, on second thought, put a tea kettle  on to boil on her hotplate.</p>
<p>She'd patted the bed beside her.</p>
<p>And  then, I couldn't tell her anything. I had tried. I had been so tempted  to spill everything: the duels, my engagement to Anthy, what she had  done to me, how I'd come in her arms and loved her and kissed her even  after all she had done, how I didn't know whether to love her or hate  her now, how both emotions warred inside me, the very thought of her  filling me with dread and heat.</p>
<p>But Wakaba was innocent. I could  not involve her in this, as I had been involved so over my head. If I  told Wakaba what had happened... somehow I knew that it would lead to a  rose signet on her finger and a sword in her hand. And also, I wanted  somebody on the outside, somebody who was normal and didn't know about  the dark undercurrents that pervaded our school. I could not tell her  any of it without telling it all.</p>
<p>So instead I just cried. She'd  pulled my head into her lap and stroked her fingers through my hair,  making soothing nurturing sounds, telling me, &quot;Itâ€™s all right. It will  be fine. You'll be OK. It's all right.&quot;</p>
<p>It was exactly the same  thing that I had murmured to Anthy when she came, and came apart in my  arms, and that just made me cry all the harder. The tea kettle had  begun to sing. Wakaba had gently replaced her lab for a pillow under my  head, then kissed my forehead and gone out of my sight. I pulled myself  into a fetal position and rocked myself back and forth. I didn't have  any more tears left to cry.</p>
<p>Then Wakaba had come back. She had a  big mug in one hand, and a box of tissues in the other. I sat up, took  the tissues and blew my nose, once, twice, three times. Then I took the  mug from her. It was hot chocolate. Just smelling it had made a small  smile come to my lips.</p>
<p>As I sipped the chocolate, Wakaba had  looked at me, her head bent to one side in silent reflection. Finally  she spoke. &quot;Utena, I don't know what has happened to you. I suspect  some things, but I hope to god none of them are true. I wish you would  tell me what's up, because I want to help you. But I'm not going to  press. I just,&quot; and now her voice had hitched. I had barely had enough  time to set my mug of hot chocolate down before she had launched  herself into my arms. &quot;I love you and I want you to be happy, and you  seem so far away sometimes and you won't tell me a thing!&quot;</p>
<p>So now I was comforting someone again, when I had thought I needed to be comforted. Somehow, it felt good.</p>
<p>Wakaba had slowly detached herself from me, blushing a bit. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm supposed to taking care of you.&quot;</p>
<p>I  found myself smiling, a real smile. &quot;It's OK, Wakaba.&quot; I kissed the top  of her onion forehead. &quot;I love you too. I'm sorry I've been away  lately. I'm going to try to be around more often. I want to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Even  now I smiled to think about what a good friend Wakaba was. Chocolate  and hugs were exactly what I needed at that moment. I had gone back to  the dorm room that Anthy and I shared without any of the answers I  needed. But I felt better.</p>
<p>Now it was half a week later. I was  laying on my bed with my face to the wall. I'd come home that day to  find that Anthy had transformed the large king sized bed back into two  twin sized beds, but instead of bunking them, she had put them both at  far sides of the room, with the bathroom door on the wall between them.  I was glad. I did not think I could stand to be on the upper bunk  knowing she was right below me. As I laid in this bed on this night, I  wondered how much of it was the same bed I'd been bound to. Were these  sheets the same sheets that had soaked up so much of my blood? If so,  where had the blood gone?</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Utena?&quot;</p>
<p>I heard Anthy's  voice and turned to look at her. She was in one of the old fashioned  lace sleeping gowns she liked to wear. I didn't know what she was going  to ask me, and I didn't care. I glared at her, suddenly needing to  know. &quot;Anthy. Why did you do that to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That?&quot; she asked, her voice studied confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  play dumb with me, Anthy.&quot; I sat up and pulled my knees to my chest,  something physical to keep between me and her. &quot;Why did you hurt me?  Why did you...&quot; it was really hard for me to say, because I didn't want  to think I was the sort of person this could happen to, but finally I  got it out, &quot;rape me. Anthy, you raped me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I...I...didn't mean...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  meant it! You meant every second of it! You knew I didn't want it like  that. You could have released me at time! You over powered me, tied me  up with your bloody roses and made me hurt too much to fight, and then  you raped me!&quot; I realized that I was screaming. At some point I had  climbed out of bed and slammed Anthy against the wall, pinning her  there with the full weight of my body as I shouted into her face. Her  face was turned to the side and I could tell that her cheeks were  getting read. Her eyes were wide in fear and something else that I knew  was also mirrored in my eyes, and I was pressed against her whole body,  from thighs, to belly, to breasts, my mouth inches from her own. I felt  her shudder throughout my whole being. I pushed myself roughly away  from her.</p>
<p>&quot;Go.&quot; I told her.</p>
<p>&quot;Go?&quot; her voice was soft, questioning.</p>
<p>&quot;No...&quot; I hadn't got my answers from her yet. I pointed at her bed.<br />
  &quot;Go sit there.&quot;</p>
<p>I went and sat on my bed and we stared at each other across the abnormally large dorm room.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthy.  I want you to tell me why.&quot; I didn't speak louder than normal, but with  this much silence between us I knew she could hear my loud and clear.</p>
<p>&quot;It's because-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not  'it!' You don't get to hide behind vague words like 'it.' The word is  rape. It's got a really clear definition. Rape is when one person  sexually assaults somebody else who says no.&quot;</p>
<p>Anthy's lips firmed  into a straight line. Some of the confidence I remembered from the  other night returned to her face. I suddenly had the feeling that I  really didn't want to hear the answer. I wanted to get up and leave the  room, but I couldn't because I'd asked the question.</p>
<p>In a voice  calmer than a dead sea, Anthy said the words that had me sagging  against the wall of my bed. &quot;I raped you because you were beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's  that supposed to mean?&quot; I was in over my head. I was in way over my  head. This room, large though it was, was much too small, and Anthy,  all the way over on her bed where she hadn't even twitched, was way too  close.</p>
<p>&quot;When you fight, you put every single part of yourself  into the duel. You don't hold anything back, there is nothing between  you and the rose on the other person's chest. Your anger is beautiful  to me. I wanted it.&quot;</p>
<p>I swallowed hard at a lump in my throat and  tried to find something to refute her words with, to change them, make  them something more palatable. &quot;B-but the thorns!&quot; I rubbed one hand  over my other wrists where it almost seemed to me that my scars burned  with phantom pain. &quot;It hurt so much. And the blood. Did you like that  too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You were beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I have to go.&quot;</p>
<p>I  got out of bed and ran to the door, ignoring the fact that I was in my  pajamas. I wrenched it open. But then, it wasn't completely closed in  the first place. I saw a flash of Wakaba's face, white as she fell  toward me. Then she was past me and in the room.</p>
<p>SLAP!</p>
<p>The  noise was loud like a bullet. I turned just in time to see Wakaba  strike Anthy again, this time on the other cheek. &quot;You bitch! You  wretch!&quot; Wakaba gave up slapping her and jumped on Anthy, her hands  made into fists and she punched her again and again. I grabbed her  around the stomach and tore her away.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me hurt her!&quot; Wakaba  yelled. &quot;I wanna scratch her eyes out!&quot; She somehow managed to slip my  grasp and went at Anthy again, this time her fingers in the shape of  claws. I grabbed her around the middle again and lifted her up so high  that she couldn't touch the ground, her feet kicking air. &quot;Why are you  protecting her!&quot; she yelled, sobbing. &quot;She raped you!&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't  say anything as I carried her out the door, shutting it behind me with  a foot. Then I set her down. She tried to go back inside, but I blocked  her way. &quot;Calm down!&quot; I said, grabbing her shoulders and giving them a  little shake. She pulled herself out of my grasp, but she didn't try go  back in side, just stood looking at me, shaking visibly.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't understand!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then tell me! Help me to understand why you can stand to live with that monster after what she did to you!&quot;</p>
<p>I said nothing. I couldn't find anything to say, since I didn't know myself.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't even know,&quot; Wakaba said, speaking my thought aloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Wakaba?&quot; I asked. I was so tired.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; she said, her voice sullen.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you just go? I can't deal with you right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Wakaba's  mouth hung open in shock and she wrapped her arms around herself as if  in pain. Then she looked up at me, gave me a sharp nod, and left.</p>
<p>I watched her walk away, knowing that I had just lost a friend.</p>
