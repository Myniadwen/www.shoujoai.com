<a href="../utena/norock-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Pray Harder

She was choking for air. The thick fingers that wrapped like bands of 
steel around her neck were worn and calloused from years of hard work 
despite the business suit he wore. Blackness was sucking at the edges of 
her brain as she felt herself slipping to unconsciousness alongside 
Wakaba. Her sword...had to...had to reach her...sss...

Jared&#39;s father, now the Sword of Religious Hatred, was using his 
supernatural strength to crush their throats with his bare hands. Out in 
the night, swords clashed amidst cries of pain. One of which sounded far 
too much like...Juri! Shiori&#39;s eyes were beginning to unfocus as silver 
eyes leaned closer to her own.

&quot;Poor mortal, it ends here...repent and ye may find forgiveness in 
death&#39;s embrace.&quot;

Akio was...Akio was down. She couldn&#39;t.... couldn&#39;t do anything but 
struggled weakly against the fingers that held her, poor injured Wakaba 
already having succumbed. Blinking through the star bursts in her 
vision, Shiori did the only thing her instincts managed to scream 
through the haze of her mind.

She kicked the man hard in the balls.

With a small grunt, Jared&#39;s father shifted slightly with that small 
motion. But inhumanly he didn&#39;t react. Frowning harder, he took a step 
forward and lifted them even higher.

&quot;GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY FUTURE WIFE YOU BASTARD!!&quot;

A blur of dark gray and green launched itself at the Sword, and all four 
of them went down hard. Shiori found herself on her back gazing up at 
the black night sky as she hacked and coughed. Spasming next to Wakaba 
as they struggled to breathe, there was a flail of limbs as Saionji and 
the sword wrestled right on top of them. Touga rushed in to help, long 
red ponytail flying as he sliced downward with his sword. Shiori managed 
to finally roll away, a waking Wakaba crawling on hands and knees as the 
two men managed to pin the sword down long enough to jam a blade through 
his heart. Ignoring the silvery white apparition that was billowing out 
of the prone man&#39;s mouth, Shiori got to her feet. The maroon-haired 
woman fumbled in the darkness for her foil as she reached out to Akio 
and felt for a pulse. Wakaba moved next to her, her nurse&#39;s training 
taking over as she checked his vital signs.

&quot;He&#39;ll be fine. Hurry! We need to go find Anthy and the others! I&#39;ll 
stay here, so you go ahead with Sai-chan and Touga!&quot;

&quot;What?! But what about you?!&quot;

&quot;Juri probably needs you. I&#39;ll be fine here. I need to get him to safety 
in case someone comes back to finish the job.&quot; Wakaba stated firmly as 
she gestured down at the unconscious Akio. A mass of bruises was 
blooming even darker on his already dark skin. His face was swollen with 
a series of nasty cuts and welts. Shiori hesitated, but Touga touched 
her shoulder as Saionji moved to Wakaba.

&quot;Nonsense! You&#39;re not going anywhere without me. Touga? Take her and go 
find Kozue and Juri. We&#39;re going to need everyone&#39;s help.&quot;

Touga nodded, but there was concern on his face. &quot;Yes...but where&#39;s 
Anthy?&quot; There were small head shakes. No one has seen her go 
anywhere...which didn&#39;t bode well at all.

&quot;Alright. We&#39;ll split up briefly for now. You two go and get the good 
Chairman upstairs and then come back down to meet with us. Call my cell 
when you&#39;re ready.&quot;

He tossed Saionji a slender black phone and then gave a nod to Shiori 
who was anxiously looking out in the dark. Where was Juri?

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

They took off running, Touga&#39;s long strides shortened slightly to match 
those of the shorter swordswoman as they raced off into the dark.

Juri was being held in the arms of a dead man, while a killer looked on 
in fearful rage. Ruka Tsuchiya...the boy who had once been her mentor 
and best friend when she&#39;d been a young girl in school. The young man 
who had taught her so much, and then had gone away for so long. Who had 
once kissed her, and then helped to break her heart when Shiori has 
betrayed her out of jealousy...and who had...had in a way freed her from 
the chains that constricted her heart.

&quot;Juri...you&#39;ve become such a lovely woman, I feel...rather jealous 
really.&quot; Spectral lips smirked back at her, that hair perpetually 
falling into his eyes just as it had done in life.

Before he....before he&#39;d died of that illness.

A strangled bark of a laugh came wetly from her throat as Juri tried to 
blink back the tears that were falling now. &quot;S-So...you w-wish you could 
have been a lovely woman too?&quot;

He laughed but it was a hollow ring in the air, not quite there. He wore 
the dueling uniform that had once been his, and touching the strangely 
light and insubstantial shoulders of his figure, Juri could almost 
imagine the feeling of rough cloth and the subtle scent of a man&#39;s 
cologne.

Miki moved around them like a shark, constantly a flow of motion as he 
hissed cat-like at the two.

&quot;Juri, thank you for freeing those others...they had been trapped here 
for so long. It&#39;s lonely to be stuck in this school unwillingly.&quot; he 
sighed gazing out about them. Juri could see the outline of trees behind 
him, faint through the transparent glow of his forehead. Her mouth was a 
frown of confusion and sorrow.

&quot;But why? Why are you here? Why did you not leave too?&quot;

Ruka smiled. &quot;Because Juri, my love...I needed to be here.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyes widened slightly, forgetting about the threat all around 
them, that Miki was waiting to tear out her throat, and that Shiori 
might be already dead somewhere.

&quot;You...Needed to be here? I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

But it didn&#39;t take long for the thought to return.

&quot;Ruka! Shiori she--my wife--she&#39;s hurt somewhere! I have to help her!!&quot;

Ruka shook his head, his smiling face never wavering. &quot;You need not 
fear, she is alive and well. Others came to her aide.&quot; He gazed at Miki 
then and shook his head.

&quot;I needed to be here, because sometimes in a school this large...with so 
many students and individuals and humans all muddled up together...with 
so many hearts to be broken and first kisses and the turmoil of a young 
adolescent as they try to find their way... They need someone. A feeling 
of peace maybe, when they visit the empty fencing hall. An invisible 
hand to catch them if they happen to accidentally slip off the stairs. A 
presence to confide to, at fountains late at night...&quot; He smiled at her 
as he said this, and Juri blushed slightly despite herself.

&quot;I loved you in life Juri. I really did. And if you couldn&#39;t return 
those feelings completely, that&#39;s alright too...I&#39;m just glad I got to 
tell you. Now I can try and help others in small ways...a sort 
of...friendly ghost I guess.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Juri whispered as she leaned her forehead down to rest on his 
chest. &quot;A guardian angel. That&#39;s what you always were, Ruka...&quot; He 
smiled at her at that, and she smiled back.

&quot;Then perhaps I can help you even further...give you my strength to 
fight.&quot; He murmured as he began to glow brighter. But a sharp howl of 
outrage interrupted them to the left.

&quot;NO! I won&#39;t allow her to gain even more power from useless spirits and 
ghosts! I know of what treachery that damnable witch has done. I&#39;ll not 
allow it!!&quot; Miki&#39;s sword raised and suddenly the air around him boiled 
invisibly. Juri would have thought it was heat waves...but the sound of 
hissing and shnick shnicking blades scraping across each other filled 
the air. His aura seemed to grow larger and darker as he eyes glowed 
with silver fire. With a roar and a pushing motion, Miki hurled his 
power into the spirit protectively hugging Juri and sent Ruka spinning 
away through the trees with a cry. A roaring Miki charged Juri and 
resumed the fight with a near manic-abandon, forcing the taller woman to 
go heavily on the defensive.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill you! I&#39;ll kill you, and enjoy it!! And suck up all of that 
power you&#39;ve stuffed yourself on!!&quot;

Juri snarled back and dug her sword into his, the two sparking with 
force. Shiori was alive...and she would fight to keep it that way.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

&quot;Stand still!!&quot; Nanami shrieked as her messy blond hair whipped about 
her face, alive in the night wind like a nest of snakes. Her sword came 
crashing down on Kozue&#39;s who paired it deftly with a flick of her wrist. 
The rose symbol on her cheek glowed green-white, the only light in the 
darkness as they sparred across the lawn. Nanami struck again and again, 
seeming to be growing desperate, while Kozue remained tauntingly cool. 
She risked a second to shove short blue bangs out of her eyes, bringing 
up the bell guard of her foil to knock a lunge away with a silvery rasp.

&quot;Is this all about me refusing to come to that ballet with you? Look 
hon, I&#39;m a busy girl...you can&#39;t just expect me to drop everything for a 
date.&quot; She attempted a sarcastic shrug but had to step out of the way of 
a charge as the sword possessing Nanami shrieked again. &quot;SHUT UP! Stupid 
mortal human, all of you are nothing but liars and oath breakers! ALL of 
you! And you in particular disgust me!!&quot;

Nanami&#39;s silver eyes were cold fire as the glared back into Kozue&#39;s own, 
and for a moment she felt her breath hitch. But then she forced the 
breath out in a shaky laugh. &quot;Yeah? Awww...sounds like someone&#39;s got a 
boo-boo, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coming from my history with the body you 
stole. Want me to kiss it and make it better?&quot; Kozue&#39;s body 
instinctively flung itself backward, which was the only thing that saved 
her from the rushing wind that passed like a massive wall across the 
place she had stood. Squinting down at the ground, Kozue noted the thick 
cuts and furrows in the earth, as if a bunch of really big invisible 
knives had just cut the crap out of it. She arched an eyebrow. &quot;My my, 
temper temper. A lady has to watch their blood pressure.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m no lady.&quot; Nanami growled out as she took up a ready stance. She 
didn&#39;t seem to be aware of the fact that the two of them had been 
steadily maneuvering in the direction of the green house. But Kozue was. 
And as she fought not to glance at the looming structure of steel bars 
and glass panes, she was already hatching a plan. Well...it wasn&#39;t 
really a plan. Touga would probably have a bit more cleverness and 
finesses. But if she could just get that dumb noisy blond to move just a 
couple more steps back...


&quot;Well goodness I certainly know that. Quite a different image you put 
out there for the rest of the world...but the Nanami I know is much 
more....intriguing.&quot; Kozue smirked as she crab-walked sideways to try 
and line up her shot.

&quot;You speak too familiarly, human whore. It matters not to me how you 
know this body. I merely need you to die!!&quot;

There! She&#39;d moved! Eyes narrowing Kozue broke into a charge, tackling 
the other woman without stopping. Their momentum carried them through 
the glass wall, crashing over top a large planter and tumbling into 
shadowed thorns and bushes. Kozue bit her tongue in a yelp as she tried 
not to cry out when several large nasty plant parts cut and tore into 
her skin. She could feel hot liquid running in itchy streams down her 
arms and face...probably had glass stuck in places too, damn it. Wincing 
as she climbed back up to all fours, she still smirked in satisfaction 
at the writhing body emitting sparks beneath her. Nanami&#39;s face 
contorted in rage as she once more felt the imprisonment of a 
rose...several actually.

Kozue climbed back to her feet and lazily lifted her sword up to trail 
the tip down Nanami&#39;s chest, stopping over her heart. She smiled coldly.

&quot;Boy...aren&#39;t you a pretty picture. All neatly wrapped up like a 
package.&quot; Indeed, there were several thorny vines and wiry shoots all 
entangled about her arms and legs and body from their tumble through the 
green house. A streak of dirt smudged the sword&#39;s face as her eyes 
rolled up into the back of her head. Kozue paused, feeling a tiredness 
envelope her softly. &quot;Haaa...why&#39;d you have to be on their side? It 
sucks. You and Miki mean a lot more to me than most people. Guess we&#39;ll 
need to talk after all this. S&#39;cuse me a second, Nana-chan.&quot; Kozue 
deftly shoved her now white-glowing blade through Nanami&#39;s heart and 
watched her gasp in pain.

As Nanami stilled and relaxed onto the floor, Kozue turned away from the 
masculine ghost that rose up out of her. Ignoring his laments and wails 
of the past, she sat down on her butt, and pulled her borrowed jacket 
closer about her. With a sigh, and running a hand through her hair, she 
fished out a cigarette and lit it.

Juri was currently locked in a struggle with the sword possessing Miki. 
Somehow in the middle of their sword match, they had gotten close enough 
to grapple. Juri had one hand wrapped about Miki&#39;s throat and a sword 
poised in the air to deliver her finishing blow, with Miki&#39;s right hand 
tightly clamped on her sword wrist. His own sword was free to position 
itself, but Juri had twisted their bodies in close to keep his arm 
pinned between them.

&quot;I...won&#39;t...lose.. Not to you.&quot; She ground out, face contorted with the 
effort of trying to free her shaking arm. Miki snarled and made a 
spitting motion. A small invisible blade of power sliced along her 
cheek, but Juri held her ground. That was when she heard the sounds of 
leaves crackling and twigs breaking underfoot.

&quot;Here! O...Over Here!&quot; Juri cried out, still keeping Miki pinned. Miki 
twisted to look over his shoulder and arched his back painfully as a 
sword spit him through the back. The tiny tip of the blade poked through 
his heart in front. Juri&#39;s body was pressed so close, that the point 
nicked her own chest through the fabric of her blouse. She scowled as 
she looked down, releasing Miki to slowly slump onto his back. &quot;Hey! A 
little close there, weren&#39;t you? You could&#39;ve waited until I had him 
maneuvered better...&quot;

Touga, who was cleaning his blade on a handkerchief out of habit rather 
than necessity, gave a small bow of apology. &quot;Terribly sorry Juri, but I 
didn&#39;t want to lose the opportunity. Are you alright...?&quot; But he fell 
quiet as Shiori came running up behind him with a loud cry.

&quot;Juri!! You&#39;re okay!!&quot; She tackled the taller woman in a tight embrace, 
burying her face into Juri&#39;s chest. The orange-haired woman was 
surprised, but then she wrapped her own arms around Shiori just as 
tightly.

&quot;That&#39;s my line...God, for a moment I was worried I&#39;d lost you.&quot; 
Reveling in the sensations of the warm body that enveloped her as if she 
were the last thing on earth, Juri allowed a few small specks of tears 
to gather at the corner of her eyes. All of the tension and worry she&#39;d 
been holding finally melting away. She lifted the small chin beneath her 
for a tender kiss. Touga stepped away to give them some privacy as he 
pulled out his cell phone. The grounds were oddly quiet now, with the 
brief pause they&#39;d gained. But somewhere out there, he knew things were 
going badly. A city full of sword-possessed zombies that were probably 
out on a rampage. And heading here no doubt. Thousands of people ready 
to kill them... They didn&#39;t have time to waste.

Dialing Kozue&#39;s number he waited through the rings until there was a 
click and her coy voice came over the phone. &quot;Well hello darling, 
calling to chat about the weather? It&#39;s rather late don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Touga smiled and it could be felt over the line, &quot;I&#39;m calling to find 
out how you&#39;re doing actually...you&#39;re far more interesting than the 
weather, my dear.&quot; He began pacing away, motioning for Juri and Shiori 
to follow. They each grabbed a limp arm and bodily lifted Miki to his 
feet. Shifting until they could support his dead weight evenly, they 
began walking carefully. Both refused to stray too far from the other he 
noticed. Moving back to give them a hand, he heard Kozue chuckle before 
she turned serious.

&quot;I&#39;m alright. Nanami&#39;s currently napping in the greenhouse, but she&#39;ll 
be okay. How many more of these things do we have left anyway?&quot;

Touga made a quick calculation, adjusting Miki&#39;s soiled jacket collar. 
&quot;There were ten swords including our dear Utena. We just finished 
manhandling your brother (hope you don&#39;t mind) and he should wake up 
shortly. So including my sister...there are seven swords accounted for.&quot;

&quot;Man! We&#39;re kicking some serious ass, wouldn&#39;t you say? We&#39;ll have this 
business wrapped up and dealt with, give that Utena girl a good slap 
upside the head, and be home before last call at the bar! Hell, we&#39;ll go 
drinking to celebrate.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm. Sounds entertaining. Unfortunately we&#39;ve run into a bit of a 
problem&quot; The three duelists carrying their friend found the path again, 
and followed it out of the woods and onto the paved edge of the campus. 
&quot;We can&#39;t find Anthy. And no one&#39;s seen the One slinking about.&quot;

There was silence on the line. Then, &quot;I see. Well that&#39;s certainly what 
I&#39;d categorize as a &#39;problem&#39;. Any clues as to where they could be?&quot;

Touga shook his head, causing Juri and Shiori to look at him. He 
answered aloud &quot;No...we can only say where she&#39;s not, based on where 
we&#39;ve been. She&#39;s not near the greenhouse, or out in the woods...we 
didn&#39;t see her near the fencing building when we were heading over to 
meet with Juri, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re in the tower or I&#39;d have 
gotten a call from Saionji and Wakaba. But I doubt they&#39;ve left the 
campus.&quot;

On the other end of the connection, Kozue gave a noisy sigh. &quot;Great. 
We&#39;re running out of time Touga. You know that. And I hate to admit it, 
but without Anthy&#39;s witchy voo-doo healing, I&#39;m not sure how much more I 
have in me. I ended up getting hurt pretty good trying to take out your 
sister you know. I bet you guys aren&#39;t looking so hot either.&quot;

Touga raised an eyebrow and looked at Juri and Shiori in turn. His voice 
was absolutely serious. &quot;I don&#39;t know Kozue-chan...I&#39;d say Juri and 
Shiori are looking hot right now. But I imagine that&#39;s usually the 
case.&quot; Ignoring the rather affronted expression and Shiori&#39;s own 
narrowed eyes, Touga smiled and went on. &quot;But for the sake of agreement, 
let&#39;s simply say we&#39;re all certainly not at our best. Where are you? I 
don&#39;t like us all split up for too long. I think it would be best to 
regroup and begin the hunt for Anthy as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;Yeah yeah, I hear you. I&#39;m in the greenhouse and...wait a sec.&quot; There 
was muffled sounds on the end of the phone as Kozue set it down and 
began speaking in low tones. From the groan and muffled exchange, it 
sounded as though Nanami had begun waking up. After a couple of minutes 
the phone was picked back up. &quot;Nanami is coming around. We&#39;ll be ready 
in a bit. Where do you want to meet?&quot;

Touga breathed an inward sigh of relief as he heard Nanami&#39;s complaints 
in the background. Feeling more assured he spoke. &quot;The fountains. I&#39;ll 
call Saionji and the others and tell them the same.

&quot;On it.&quot; The phone went dead in his hand, and he folded it up and put it 
away. Miki&#39;s shoes were dragging along the ground as they carried him 
along between them, his head lolling about drunkenly. Pausing to wrap an 
arm about Miki&#39;s midsection, Touga hoisted him bodily and adjusted him 
into a fireman&#39;s carry. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of Miki, Shiori-san, if you&#39;ll 
reach into my pocket--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll do no such thing, pervert.&quot; Juri cut in, dryly.

&quot;...And take the first aid kit out. It should be in my left pants 
pocket. I think you should take a look at Juri and yourself, since we 
don&#39;t have Anthy to rely on at the moment.&quot; He raised an eyebrow at Juri 
who rolled her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m fine. But when did you find time to grab a first aid kit?&quot; Sure 
enough Shiori hunted about and finally produced a slender white plastic 
case that probably had only the bare minimum of what they really needed. 
She set to work on Juri&#39;s gashes and cuts, swatting the older woman 
whenever she complained.

&quot;It was around the time you were sulking with the Chairman. Before 
things got busy.&quot; Juri huffed a bit, wincing as Shiori applied a 
bandaid.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say sulking...but that was pretty sharp thinking on your 
part.&quot; She complimented. Touga smirked, and gave his ponytail a toss.

&quot;I&#39;m not just another pretty face you know.&quot; Juri smirked and shook her 
head. He continued,&quot;Here, go ahead and give Saionji and Wakaba a call. 
Hopefully they&#39;ve gotten the Chairman to come around.&quot;

They passed dark empty classroom buildings as they wound their way 
around towards central school fountains. Juri spoke quietly over the 
phone, as she gave instructions and updated the other group. They were 
moving quietly but quickly towards their destination, Nanami and Kozue 
approaching in the distance, when suddenly--

&quot;Wh...What in the hell is THAT?&quot; Kozue&#39;s voice cried as the duelist&#39;s 
faces affixed to the sky.

&quot;What indeed...&quot; Touga&#39;s mouth was hard frown as he clenched his hands a 
little tighter on Miki&#39;s limp body. In the sky, rising like a candle 
flame higher and higher was an enormous blue-white light that pulsated 
with a bright glow. Slowly swirling up from the ground was a string of 
ethereal blades made of a darker blue light, that trailed like a chain 
around the edges of the pillar. The frightening display was coming 
somewhere from the direction of the dorm rooms...the East Dorm to be 
precise.

Touga waited as his friends and companions gathered about him, battered 
and injured, and all wearing grim expressions as they watched the show 
overhead. Even Wakaba was silent, her face worried as she leaned on 
Saionji&#39;s arm.

&quot;It looks as though we won&#39;t have to go searching for them. I believe 
this is an open invitation.&quot; Akio&#39;s voice said softly as he joined them 
as well, his steps careful as he worked not to jar his injured chest any 
further.

Juri nuzzled Shiori&#39;s hair and gave her a squeeze. Miki groaned and 
tried to sit up on Touga&#39;s shoulders. He blinked his blue eyes open 
tiredly and held onto Touga&#39;s arm as he was helped into a cautious 
standing position. Swaying slightly, he pressed slender fingers to the 
bridge of his nose before coughing a bit and raising his hoarse voice.

&quot;T...Then...I-I&#39;d like...to not d-disappoint them.&quot;

The group of swordsmen shifted a bit, and then began moving as one in 
the direction of the East Dorm.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

And in the darkness of the rooftop, silhouetted against the bright light 
of the beacon blazing it&#39;s blue light, two remaining swords waited. 
Their bodies were still and without movement, not even their eyes 
blinked. Behind them the One rested on a throne of twisted scrap metal. 
Her face was stretched into a cruel grin as she swirled a wine glass 
idly in her hand. The thick red substance inside stained the sides of 
the glass as it sloshed. And before her, Anthy was writhing on the 
ground in the center of a massive spell circle, her wrists and ankles 
pinned to the concrete roof by the use of four long daggers. Blood 
pooled around her as she drew another ragged breath from behind her duct 
tape gag.

Grinning as she held Anthy&#39;s gaze, the One took a sip.

&quot;Soon little Rose...just wait a little longer. I haven&#39;t broken my word. 
You&#39;re still alive. But soon...that won&#39;t matter.&quot;

Utena&#39;s head jerked back as she began laughing. It rose in pitch, her 
entire body shaking with it. She kept laughing and laughing and 
laughing, madness and cruelty thick enough to choke on.

Anthy could only squeeze her eyes shut in pain, to try and drown it out 
the sound.
