--------------------------------------------------

 &quot;Yes. Yes, I&#39;ve seen her,&quot; the young clerk said confused, 
looking from the bookworm next to the woman in question on 
the picture to the gorgeous woman in front of him. The 
same face, he thought, but everything else was different. 
Her inquiring eyes snapped him back to reality.

 &quot;Yes, she checked in two hours ago,&quot; he finally went on, 
making Anthy - alert as a cat creeping across a cracking 
tree branch - gasp with excitement. &quot;Room 28, up on the 
second floor.&quot;

 Anthy couldn&#39;t believe what she was hearing. In less than 
a minute she was up the stairway, in front of the room 
with the number 28, the 8 slightly crooked. Her heart was 
banging against her chest and her mouth was dry. Before 
she could chicken out, before she even thought about what 
to say her hand already knocked twice against the door, in 
rhythm with her heartbeat.

 She heard sounds from inside the room, floorboards 
creaking and suddenly, with a gush of wind the door opened 
abruptly. And then she was looking into those light blue 
eyes again, amazed at the fire within, that the picture, 
which she had held so close for the past months, couldn&#39;t 
dare try to capture. With a fixation she couldn&#39;t control 
she was drawn into those pools and in that moment she 
drowned, died, exploded in them to be reborn again in a 
completely different world. Or so it seemed to her.

 And then she felt two strong arms grab her and hold her 
fiercely and with determination in a tight hug. Relishing 
in the feeling as long as it lasted and almost melting 
away she then felt a strong grip on her wrist and was 
swept forward, into the room to find herself floating 
through it and being sat down on the bed seconds later. 
Again she was looking into the now bright shining eyes 
inches away from her own. She saw a hand rise up to her 
face and felt the touch send waves of emotions so primal 
it made her intellect dissolve. The finger traveled from 
her cheek down across her jawbone to her throat making her 
skin burn and peel away from the sheer intensity before 
breaking contact, thus finally snapping them out of their 
trance.

 &quot;Hi- Himemiya...&quot; she heard the voice that matched the 
face.

 &quot;Utena-sa-,&quot; her own voice began and she had to bite down 
on her lip, as she wanted to say like she had become used 
to, even though she resolved not to do that anymore. 
&quot;Utena. I found you at last.&quot;

 &quot;Himemiya, no, I mean Anthy... I-...&quot; The words got stuck 
and Anthy felt an easeful silence surround them. Words 
were just to crude to explain everything what was going on 
inside them. Just looking at Utena so close to her that 
she could sense then familiar and comforting scent of her 
perspiration made her lips curl upward. She sighed and 
suddenly both were smiling brightly from the pure joy. 

 Utena got up to get some water for them and they talked 
until Anthy fell asleep on the bed, long after the moon 
and the stars came out. After covering her with a blanket 
Utena made herself comfortable on the sofa and fell asleep 
instantly. They only did some small talk, just for the 
sake of hearing the melodies of each other&#39;s voices, not 
even listening to what they were conveying.
