<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 15 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        Integra sighed softly, coming awake between her two oddly 
cool bedpartners. Her entire body was sore, but in an oddly pleasant 
sort of way, and she felt each and every aching muscle as she 
cautiously wiggled out between the two of them and off of the bed. 
Her slim body practically reeked of sex, and she luxuriated in the 
scent as she pulled her discarded nightgown over her body, grabbing 
her glasses from the nightstand.

        The hot shower revived her somewhat, and the three cups of 
coffee she ordered from room service helped finish the job. The maid 
had given her the oddest look when Integra answered, pinkness 
rushing to the little redhead&#39;s cheeks. It wasn&#39;t until she saw a 
mirror that she realized she had twin hickeys on either side of her 
neck, left by her two lover&#39;s passion.

        Integra gave a happy sigh, settling down into her 
chair. &#39;I&#39;m going to need vitamin shots or something just to keep up 
with the two of them,&#39; she mused. It was a surprisingly pleasant 
thought, really. She reached out to her phone, dialing a number from 
memory. &quot;Walter?&quot; she asked after it was picked up after one ring.

        &quot;Yes, Miss Integra?&quot; Walter&#39;s perfect English butler voice 
came through clearly.

        She often wondered if Walter practiced that voice in 
private, but she hadn&#39;t actually asked him. &quot;Prepare another room in 
the crypts,&quot; Integra instructed him, &quot;Anthy is coming home.&quot;

        &quot;Of course, Miss Integra,&quot; Walter answered calmly. He seemed 
to simply accept the fact that Anthy had been turned, not asking 
foolish questions. &quot;I look forward to seeing her again. May I ask 
when we can expect you home?&quot;

        Integra smiled wryly. Walter could also be a bit of an old 
lady at times. &quot;Hopefully soon,&quot; she answered, &quot;Anthy has some 
unfinished business to take care of.&quot;

        &quot;Very good, Miss Integra,&quot; Walter answered.

        Integra put the phone down, frowning slightly as she 
considered the unfinished business Anthy had talked about between 
periods of lovemaking. &#39;This Miyu likely will not be a problem,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;but the other one, this Mrs. Ohtori... she could be 
trouble.&#39;

        Privately, Integra thought that Anthy&#39;s commitment to attend 
the party tonight was very foolish. Still, her friend was 
notoriously honorable, and she would not walk away from a battle. 
Which meant that she, along with Victoria, were also going to be at 
that little ball.

        &quot;We&#39;ll protect Anthy,&quot; Integra murmured as she drank more 
coffee, her gray hair flowing back as the light caught her 
glasses, &quot;and I&#39;ll have the chance to see what sort of fool this 
Utena is, to turn away from Anthy&#39;s love.&quot;

        Later that day the sun shone brightly as Saya strode down 
the street, moving into the entrance of the stylish apartment 
building. She was unique, the very last of her kind, and the 
sunlight was no trouble to her. The young man dozed at the security 
desk as she strode by, the lingering scent of vampires driving her 
onwards.

        The trail led up the stairs, out onto a upper floor, and 
down to a apartment door. Saya would have gone nearer, but the door 
opened and two humans, a young man and woman who were both untouched 
by the vampire taint came out.

        &#39;They have human servants here,&#39; Saya thought as she went 
back down the stairway, &#39;that makes this all just a bit more 
complicated.&#39;

        Many years ago Saya had sworn an oath not to kill humans. It 
was a hard vow, one she was tempted to break more often than not, 
but it meant something to her. Others of her kind fed on humans, 
twisted them with their taint, but she would not.

        And so she was alone.

        &#39;Don&#39;t think about that,&#39; Saya reminded herself 
firmly, &#39;think about the mission.&#39;

        This Utena was unusual, but just how strange she was Saya 
wasn&#39;t quite sure yet. Miyu didn&#39;t tolerate any unexpected guests to 
her domain, and she knew of more than one vampire that had been 
completely destroyed by the Princess. Utena still lived, which meant 
she was unusually strong. And then there were all her companions...

        Vampires quite rarely gathered together, usually only under 
the reign of a far stronger elder vampire who compelled the others 
obedience. There were always clear signs of that, power almost 
palatable in the air, but around that place there was none. However 
Utena was keeping her companions there, it wasn&#39;t by force.

        &#39;This could be a good hunt,&#39; Saya mused as she settled in a 
seat at a noodle cart. She ordered then calmly waited until the 
young man and woman that she had seen earlier go by, then she 
finished up her bowl of noodles. Her sword concealed by it&#39;s kendo 
case she got up, silently falling into step a little behind them.

        Wakaba sighed softly, her curly brown hair falling into her 
eyes. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe Anthy just left like that,&quot; she said 
softly.

        Ruka smiled wryly, pushing his blue hair out of his 
eyes. &quot;It doesn&#39;t really surprise me,&quot; he admitted, &quot;Anthy has her 
pride.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Wakaba nodded.

        Ruka&#39;s lips twitched in a small smile, &quot;I notice the girl 
groupies aren&#39;t up yet.&quot;

        Wakaba scowled, &quot;Utena and Juri took them into the bedroom 
last night.&quot; She shook her head, a look of frustration on her 
face, &quot;Why not me!&quot;

        &quot;Utena loves you,&quot; Ruka shrugged.

        Wakaba gazed up at him in honest surprise, &quot;What?&quot;

        &quot;She loves you,&quot; Ruka repeated calmly, &quot;as much as she does 
Juri, probably. That&#39;s why she protects you so fiercely, even from 
herself.&quot;

        Wakaba nodded thoughtfully, a look of wonder on her 
face. &quot;If that&#39;s so,&quot; she finally said to him softly, &quot;how do I 
convince her I don&#39;t want to be protected?&quot; With a fierce blush she 
added, &quot;Especially from her?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s the hard part,&quot; Ruka agreed. Changing the subject he 
asked there anything we have to get for tonight&#39;s party?&quot;

        Wakaba snickered softly, unfolding a list from her coat 
pocket. &quot;Where do you want to start?&quot; she asked him wryly.

        &quot;Gah,&quot; Ruka made a face. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get to it,&quot; he sighed.

        It took the two of them a few hours to pick up everything on 
the list, the bags that Ruka was carrying multiplying quickly. &quot;And 
why do I have to carry all this?&quot; Ruka complained.

        &quot;Because you&#39;re the big, strong man,&quot; Wakaba batted her eyes 
at him.

        Ruka made a face, but didn&#39;t answer. Softly he said, &quot;About 
what we were talking about, with you and Utena?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Wakaba looked up at him in surprise.

        &quot;I think you&#39;re going to have to take the choice out of her 
hands,&quot; Ruka smiled wryly, &quot;though I&#39;m not quite sure how.&quot;

        Wakaba nodded thoughtfully, &quot;I think I do, maybe.&quot;

        The groceries, blood packets from the medical supplies 
company, and the clothes that they had ordered for tonight, all of 
them were packed away carefully. Wakaba excused herself, noticing 
that the sun was just begining to go down.

        The room that Wakaba used was quiet as she calmly stripped 
her blue and white school girl&#39;s outfit off, letting it puddle on 
the floor. Matching bra and panties soon followed, and she paused to 
look into her mirror. Her curly brown hair fell into her eyes, perky 
breasts pushing up, her body slim but still quite attractive.

        Abandoning her reflection, Wakaba moved on. The perfume she 
chose was subtle, delicate, as she dabbed a bit between her breasts 
and on one of two other spots on her body. The nightie she pulled on 
over her head flowed around her body, almost transparent. She slid 
from her bedroom, quietly moving down the hall to the master bedroom.

        Opening up the door silently, Wakaba felt a bit of relief 
that Utena&#39;s serving girl&#39;s were up and gone. Two pale forms, Juri 
and Utena, lay on the bed side by side, and she hesitated a moment. 
Then Juri&#39;s head came up, she smiled slightly, and waved her towards 
the bed. Juri slid back a bit, helping Wakaba climb on the bed 
between them.

        The smalled girl snuggled in between them, the motion enough 
to wake up Utena. Her eyes gradually opened, then widened in 
surprise, &quot;Wha..?&quot;

        Wakaba wiggled forward, pressing her body to Utena&#39;s even as 
she took advantage of the girl&#39;s surprise. The kiss she planted on 
Utena was passionate, their nearly nude bodies pressed together 
firmly. Wakaba slid back just a bit, stopped by the cool presence of 
Juri pressed up against her back, a comforting presence.

        Juri&#39;s breath tickled Wakaba&#39;s ear as she softly said to 
Utena, &quot;She knows what she&#39;s doing, Tenjou, you can&#39;t protect her 
from this.&quot;

        Utena lay there, Wakaba holding her by the shoulders, then 
the pink haired woman smiled wryly, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; She met Wakaba&#39;s 
gaze, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for being so dense.&quot;

        &quot;Just one of the things I love about you,&quot; Wakaba said with 
a little smile.

        Juri&#39;s laughter was warm. With a smile and a nod towards 
Utena she asked Wakaba, &quot;And how long has she been torturing you?&quot;

        &quot;Months,&quot; Wakaba sighed dramatically.

        Juri smiled a dangerous smile, &quot;Then let&#39;s not keep her 
waiting any longer.&quot;

        &quot;You asked for it,&quot; Utena agreed as she kissed Wakaba again.

        &quot;Both of you..?&quot; Wakaba squeaked softly as both women firmly 
sandwiched her between them. &quot;I am in so much trouble..&quot; she 
murmured softly.
