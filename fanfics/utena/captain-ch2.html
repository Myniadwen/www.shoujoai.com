<h1>Captain of the Guard (part 2 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/captain-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Utena ushered her into a small suite, and firmly shut the door behind 
them. The room was very Spartan, a simple bed, nightstand, a wardrobe, 
and, surprisingly, a large bookcase. Even in the civilized countries, 
books were rare, the providence of scholars and mages. They were 
something that was seen few and far between, but there must have been 
nearly two dozen of them there.

&#147;My god,&#148; Anthy murmured, looking at the bookcase, &#147;whose room is 
this?&#148;

&#147;Hmm?&#148; Utena said, clearly distracted. &#147;Oh, it&#146;s mine, Princess.&#148; She 
jumped up at the sound of a knock and quickly pulled the door open. 
Juri walked in, looking irritable.

&#147;Utena, we&#146;ve got the archer,&#148; Juri said, &#147;but he had a poison filled 
tooth. He&#146;s dead.&#148; Utena growled under her breath. &#147;There&#146;s more, I&#146;m 
certain he had help getting in,&#148; Juri added.

Utena just nodded, her expression bleak. &#147;Since an archer tried to 
kill the King, we&#146;ve had regular sweeps of the rooftops,&#148; Utena said 
grimly. &#147;He had to have known out patrol times, as well as which 
window led to the Princess&#146;s quarters.&#148;

Juri nodded agreement. &#147;I&#146;m going to check if any guards have 
outstanding debts, or other things that could be used as leverage.&#148;

Utena grimaced, &#147;This is going to be messy, Juri.&#148; Juri nodded 
agreement.

As Juri was leaving, she stopped and leaned over to whisper to Utena 
&#147;You&#146;ve already gotten her in your room, and only on your first day 
guarding her! I am impressed,&#148; she teased.

Utena blushed and hustled her out of the room. She returned, only to 
see Anthy muffling a soft giggle. &#147;You heard, I take it?&#148; Utena said 
smiling.

Anthy managed to get her giggles under control. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but the 
look on your face,&#148; Anthy said, and gave in to the urge to laugh. 
Utena sat down and laughed with her, letting it all out.

&#145;A perfectly normal reaction to stress,&#146; Utena though, &#145;I&#146;ve seen it 
on the battlefield many times.&#146; She looked at the girl and was 
distracted a moment by her beauty. Shaking herself, she smiled and 
said &#147;I noticed you looking at my books.&#148;

&#147;Oh,&#148; Anthy said smiling, &#147;it&#146;s just that I hadn&#146;t seen so many in one 
place.&#148; She looked shyly up at Utena, &#147;Where did you get so many?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a long story,&#148; Utena started, and saw Anthy&#146;s disappointed look, 
so she continued &#147;but I&#146;ll make it short. When I was younger, and much 
more foolish, I joined a mercenary company, the Skybolts.&#148;

Anthy looked surprised. &#147;We&#146;ve used that company as well,&#148; she said.

Utena grinned impishly, &#147;I better not tell any tall tales of my great 
heroism then, princess.&#148;

&#147;Would you stop calling me that?&#148; Anthy snapped. Utena looked at her, 
surprised, and Anthy blushed. &#147;My friends, and personal servants, call 
me by name. I&#146;d prefer you do so as well,&#148; Anthy said, a silent appeal 
in her eyes.

&#147;Of course, Anthy,&#148; Utena said with a hesitant smile. Anthy smiled 
back at her warmly. &#147;Where was I, oh yes, after I joined the 
mercenaries, I became friends with one of the mages, Kethry, and her 
partner Tarma. She taught me to read during some of the winter 
campaigns,&#148; Utena said with a wistful smile.

She shook herself, and laughed softly &#147;As to where I got the books, we 
would occasionally take a castle or keep, and while my friends were 
looting, I&#146;d usually hit the libraries. I got some odd looks, but I 
think I enjoyed what I got more than they did.&#148;

Anthy looked at her thoughtfully, wondering a bit about the woman who 
taught Utena to read. She was about to ask about her, but decided not 
too. &#145;When I know Utena better,&#146; Anthy thought, &#145;I&#146;ll ask,&#146; and 
wondered at the tiny bit of jealousy in her heart.

They continued to talk, and Utena grew lively as she talked of the 
misadventures that could happen in a mercenary company. Anthy knew 
Utena was trying to distract her, and appreciated the effort. As Utena 
wrapped up another tale, they heard the sound of a door knock. Utena 
answered it, and Anthy&#146;s eyes widened as she took in the young 
guardsman standing there.

Juri gave him a shove, and sent Touga staggering into the room. &#147;Tell 
them what you told me, Kiryuu.&#148; Juri said grimly.

He dropped to his knees in front of the princess, crying loudly. &#147;They 
paid off my poker bets,&#148; he said, &#147;in exchange for a guard uniform! I 
just thought it was a joke, I didn&#146;t know they were going to..&#148; he 
broke down, blubbering loudly.

Anthy looked at him with obvious distaste. &#147;Who was it?&#148; Utena asked 
Touga forcefully.

&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; he said, still crying. &#147;He stood in the shadows, and I 
only saw bits and pieces. He&#146;s tall, dark skinned like a noble, and 
dressed fine.&#148;

&#147;Get him out of here,&#148; Utena sighed. &#147;Put him in the cells, for now.&#148;

&#147;What will happen to him?&#148; Anthy asked quietly.

Utena sighed. &#147;Even if he is as dumb as he sounds, which I doubt, he 
still helped in an assassination attempt. He&#146;ll be tried for treason, 
and likely executed,&#148; Utena finished.

Anthy sighed sadly. &#147;He was a good officer once, before drink and the 
gambling,&#148; she said.

Utena nodded. &#147;Do you intend to grant him royal mercy?&#148; Utena asked 
cautiously.

Anthy shrugged. &#147;In truth, I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;Wait until we can fully investigate,&#148; Utena cautioned. &#147;I wonder if 
there&#146;s something more involved.&#148;

Anthy looked over at her, smiling. &#147;I&#146;m glad you are so diligent in my 
protection.&#148;

&#147;I take it your previous Captain wasn&#146;t?&#148; Utena said sighing. &#147;The 
more I hear about him, the less I like.&#148;

Anthy laughed softly, &#147;Join the club.&#148; </pre>
