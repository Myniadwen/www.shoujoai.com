<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 19 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/revolution-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Sally Po pushed brown hair out of her eyes, leaning up
against the wall of the small room that had been
converted into a cell for both her and her companion.
&quot;What do you think they&#39;re going to do?&quot; she asked
softly, her plain jumpsuit spotlessly clean.

The black haired woman looked up from where she turned
the gleaming rose signet on her finger, her expression
grave, &quot;Wish I knew, Sally.&quot; Lt. Noin smiled faintly,
her eyes gentle, &quot;You know, you don&#39;t need to be
here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not taking an offer from them if you don&#39;t
ma&#39;am,&quot; Sally said firmly.

&quot;Just Noin, here,&quot; she sighed. A faint smile, &quot;Or if
you must, Lucrenzia.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Sally blinked.

Noin sat up on the bunk, her expression amused, &quot;My
hated first name. You can guess why I prefer just
Noin.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Sally said diplomatically.

Noin laughed softly, her eyes twinkling. &quot;Oh yes it
is,&quot; she said mildly. &quot;And how do you shorten it? The
best you can do is Lucy, and I certainly don&#39;t look
like a Lucy...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know...,&quot; Sally teased her softly, the
two exchanging a warm smile. There was a moment of
silence as they sat there, then Sally sighed softly
and asked a question on both of their minds, &quot;What do
we do about Dorothy?&quot;

&quot;When we get out of here, I&#39;m going to track her down
and kill her,&quot; Noin&#39;s voice was suddenly ice cold,
much like her eyes.

&quot;Noin?&quot; Sally actually looked startled.

&quot;I knew Catalonia was ambitious,&quot; Noin said grimly, &quot;I
was nervous about having her at our backs from the
start.&quot; A pause, &quot;But after she crippled our suits she
could have just moved on... instead, she put
additional rounds in our suits intending to kill us.&quot;

&quot;I thought so,&quot; Sally conceded softly. She met Noin&#39;s
eyes, &quot;You know she&#39;s going to have a cover story in
place if we turn up again.&quot;

Noin nodded but said, &quot;I don&#39;t care. I am not willing
to let her get away with betraying us.. or trying to
kill you.&quot;

A faint blush colored Sally&#39;s cheeks as she looked
away from the sudden warmth in Noin&#39;s voice, hinting
at what had been growing between them over the months
they had worked together. &quot;I&#39;ll be there to help,&quot; she
said, voice husky.

Noin looked troubled, her expression as uncertain as
Sally had ever seen it. &quot;You were with me when we
stopped those,&quot; she paused a second, &quot;calling them
just murderous scum seems too mild, somehow....&quot;

Sally flinched. She and Noin had participated in a
joint operation with several of the Specials Troops,
one that had gone badly wrong. Several of their own
soldiers had attempted to massacre their unarmed
captives, and only Sally and Noin had been there to
stop them. She knew it had troubled Noin almost as
much as it had her, but she had rarely talked about
it.

&quot;More and more I find myself wondering if we&#39;re on the
right side anymore,&quot; Noin admitted something that both
of them had been thinking. She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m
certain Treize and Zechs have the best of intentions,
but we both know what the road to hell is paved by.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re loyal soldiers, it&#39;s not our place to be
questioning our command,&quot; Sally said, feeling odd
playing the devil&#39;s advocate. Once upon a time it
would have been her asking the questions that Noin
was, and in truth it all bothered her, too.

&quot;We were only following orders,&quot; Noin smiled grimly,
&quot;isn&#39;t a good enough excuse.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I may not
be prepared to throw my lot in with the colonies, but
I&#39;m actually glad we&#39;ve been taken out of the fight.&quot;



Meanwhile, back on Earth, a figure gazed out of the
window of a luxurious villa, his expression
unreadable. Treize Khushrenada turned as he heard
someone enter, his brown hair and clothes as neat as
they ever were. &quot;So,&quot; he asked the new arrival
smoothly, &quot;how long am I to be under house arrest?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not under house arrest,&quot; Dorothy Catalonia
said mildly, &quot;I believe you&#39;ve retired to your villa
to recover from illness.&quot; The regal blonde actually
looked apologetic as she said, &quot;This really wasn&#39;t my
idea.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Treize conceded.

The political maneuvering on Earth had grown wild with
the declaration of war by the colonies, along with the
ongoing conflicts between the Specials and the regular
military. In the end a compromise had been worked out,
but part of it involved Treize&#39;s removal from command
replacing him with a regular military general. It was
a considerable mess, considering his inexperience with
the Specials capabilities, but there was little
choice.

&quot;I&#39;m not getting many updates,&quot; Treize said as he
waved Dorothy to a seat, &quot;can you tell me how the war
is going?&quot;

&quot;Stalemate,&quot; Dorothy answered simply. &quot;The Colonies
lack the forces required to take Fortress Barge, while
they&#39;ve been able to beat back any attacks from our
forces.&quot;

Treize noted her tone of voice, &quot;But that&#39;s changing?&quot;

Dorothy nodded, a smile on her face. &quot;The Gundams have
initiated a new tactic,&quot; she said, &quot;they&#39;re disabling
and capturing Leos, refitting them and fielding them
on their side.&quot;

&quot;The tide is shifting to their side,&quot; Treize mused.
&quot;Is the battleship Libra ready to be deployed?&quot; he
asked thoughtfully.

&quot;The reluctance to deploy Mobile Dolls is slowing
things down,&quot; Dorothy said, &quot;as is the technical
difficulties with the new Gemini armors.&quot; A scowl,
&quot;The Gundam designers are reluctant allies at best,
and are dragging their feet.&quot;

A faint smile, &quot;They have done a good job on my
project, however.&quot; Treize looked thoughtful, &quot;I
suspect it&#39;s the challenge, more than anything.&quot;

&quot;Creating a suit that can defeat the Gundams?&quot; Dorothy
smiled, &quot;Yes, that challenge would appeal to them.&quot;

Treize hesitated a moment, &quot;And how is Colonel Une?&quot;

Dorothy sighed, wishing he had not asked her that.
&quot;Colonel Une has been relieved of her duties,&quot; she
said grimly.

&quot;What?&quot; Treize blurted.

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t let go over what happened to you,&quot;
Dorothy explained to him patiently, &quot;and even publicly
threatened Romafeller over it, quite reasonably
surmising that they were behind your situation.&quot;
Quickly she added, &quot;I&#39;m pulling whatever strings I
can, she should be all right.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, old friend,&quot; Treize sighed. He looked down
at the rose signet he wore, turning it thoughtfully,
&quot;And Zechs?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s reluctantly taking on the role of Miliardo
Peacecraft,&quot; Dorothy related, &quot;as planned. I think
he&#39;d rather have Releena in that role, but our
attempts to contact her failed.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a nice way of putting it,&quot; Treize chuckled,
&quot;she&#39;s joined the colonies, correct?&quot;

&quot;I thought you were mostly cut off...?&quot; Dorothy looked
concerned.

&quot;Even without my regular information sources I can
speculate,&quot; Treize said dryly. He sat back, &quot;Releena
was already in their camp due to her association with
Arisugawa, and I suspect her experiences in the
colonies only helped push her along.&quot;

Dorothy made a face, &quot;You should be running things
still, sir.&quot;

&quot;It will happen soon enough,&quot; he reassured her. Treize
smiled, &quot;So Miliardo is advocating peace while his
sister speaks for war. It&#39;s an amusing reversal for
Zechs, at least.&quot;

&quot;He and Ambassador Darlain are working together in a
rather unholy alliance,&quot; Dorothy confirmed, &quot;while I
understand Releena Peacecraft will be presenting a
list of the Colonies&#39; peace demands to the Earth
soon.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s going to be an interesting time,&quot; Treize agreed.</pre>
