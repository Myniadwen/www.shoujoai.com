<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>One more pop of the neck and Utena was ready. The one thing that could 
end this Prince&#146;s drawn-out school day without failure...besides 
Himemiya&#146;s blood-pumping note...was basketball. The other members of 
the team all gathered on the court preparing for practice. Four males 
of one team dressed identically in black shorts and a light blue 
practice jersey; one girl dressed in skintight, red shorts and a light 
ashen-purple, formfitting, tank top. The &quot;opposing&quot; team wore black 
shorts and red jerseys. 

The coach stepped in the center, a basketball resting in one hand. 

&quot;Okay...blue side header: Tenjou; red side header...hmm...&quot; Thumbing 
through his team rosters, he noticed the name scribbled in pen under 
all the typed ones. &quot;Ah...that new kid. Okay...red side header: 
Shintaro.&quot; Utena&#146;s sky-blue eyes quickly began darting around the 
court in search of the infamous new kid. 

&quot;Dammit...that jerk gets in the student council and made the team 
already!?&quot; The normally calm exterior of the pink-headed victor 
darkened at the thought of someone like that guy on her favorite sport 
team. The imaginary &quot;cloud of misfortune&quot; formed over Utena&#146;s 
carnation colored head.

&quot;Tenjou! Center court, now!&quot; The deep voice of the coach brought the 
slightly angered duelist back to reality and she sprinted to center 
court at the boom of the command.

&quot;Yes, yes! Sorry.&quot; Utena planted her rubber-soled feet on the floor 
and prepared for the game. The coach went in between the hotheaded 
Utena and the big-mouthed Keingo. 

&quot;Nice to see we could pay attention to practice, Tenjou-kun.&quot; Keingo 
whispered sarcastically. &quot;You can dress like a basketball player, but 
do you got any game?&quot; 

&quot;Shut-up. I&#146;m gonna wipe this floor with your egotistical face. You&#39;re 
on my court, now.&quot; 

&quot;Oh? Well, aren&#39;t we confident.&quot; Keingo muttered with a smirk. 
&quot;Please, go easy on me, Tenjou-kun. I&#39;d hate to be embarrassed during 
my first practice.&quot; At that time, the ball went in the air at the 
face-off, Keingo&#146;s legs taking him in the air a split second before 
his distracted rival&#146;s, though, Utena&#146;s smaller frame came up quicker. 
The ivory-white hand of the prince reached out to knock the airborne 
ball back to her team, but a larger hand came in contact right below 
Utena&#146;s neck and forcefully pushed her back as the ball was batted to 
Keingo&#146;s side. Utena, on the other hand, came down hard on the back of 
her neck and lied motionless for a moment.

&quot;Baka, Tenjou-kun!&quot; The egotistical boy mocked Utena&#146;s fall as the 
whistle sounded to pause the game, the coach going to the fallen 
player&#146;s side.

&quot;Tenjou! Are you all right? Tenjou!&quot; The coach&#146;s hand lightly slapped 
the reddened cheek of his female player, hoping to get a response.

&quot;Unnn...itaiiii...&quot; Utena managed to mumble through gritted teeth. 

&quot;Are you gonna be okay, Tenjou?&quot;

&quot;Yes, hi, coach...I...I guess I must have slipped.&quot;

&quot;Well, be more careful. A blow to the neck from a fall like that can 
really mess ya up, and I need ya in good health for the championship 
game.&quot; The coach said sternly while offering the humiliated athlete a 
hand. Utena stood, pain shooting through her neck like lightning. Out 
of the corner of her glazed eyes, Keingo could be seen, striding over 
toward her like a wild animal out to claim his prey.

&quot;Hey, no hard feelings there, eh, Tenjou-kun?&quot; The smirking boy 
offered his hand to his rival in mock apology, but Utena slapped it 
away and went back to the game. 

&quot;Ooo...feisty little girl, aren&#39;t ya. Failures like that aren&#39;t 
tolerated in sports, ya know. Better get your act together, there, 
Tenjou-kun...or is that...Tenjou-chan? Helpless little girls shouldn&#39;t 
be playing sports with the big guys.&quot; Utena&#146;s jewel-blue eyes flashed 
with anger at the demeaning denotation. 

&quot;You have no authority to talk to me like that! Just get off that trip 
of yours and play the damn game...fairly!&quot;

&quot;All right, team...game on!&quot; The whistle sounded again and the game 
went on.

Near the end of practice, the team played like it were a real game, or 
at least Utena and Keingo did. Both rivals playing as if their very 
lives depended on who won, even though no score was being kept. The 
practice clock ticked through it&#146;s final minute as the quick and agile 
duelist raced for the basket at breakneck speed. 

&quot;This game&#146;s mine...&quot; she thought victoriously. The goal of her win 
was within her reach as she leaped up and...got shoved back onto her 
rear.

&quot;Goal tending, Shintaro!&quot; The couch shouted after the sound of his 
whistle. A smirk spread on his features as he picked up the ball and 
watched Utena angrily rise to her feet, pride obviously tainted. 

&quot;Hey, Tenjou-kun! Heads up!&quot; He threw the ball towards the backside of 
his rival, as she turned, she took the ball to the face, falling back 
once again, colors flashing in her eyes as it hit her, hard. &quot;Oops! 
Sorry about that, Tenjou-kun. I thought you were quicker than that!&quot; 
The utterly humiliated victor placed a hand over her eye as the other 
touched gently to her lips. Her small pink tongue ran over the bitter 
taste of her blood. Pain...the whole game was full of pain. Utena&#146;s 
pride felt as if it had been severed, along with the cut lip, bruised 
back-neck, and developing black eye to add to the injuries. The girls 
that filled the basketball court gasped, cried out, and screamed at 
the sight of their beloved Tenjou Utena-sama lying on the hardwood 
floors in a daze.

&quot;All right, team. That&#39;s enough for today. Hit the showers.&quot; The coach 
sighed and dismissed the team. &quot;Tenjou, go get some rest. I think 
you&#39;re just having a bad day.&quot; The team cleared the floor in a small 
crowd.

&quot;Oh you think?&quot; Utena muttered sarcastically.

&quot;Utenaaaa-samaaaa!&quot; The concerned cry of Wakaba rang out over the 
gasps and shouts of the other girls as she pushed her way through the 
crowded sideline and onto the court to side with her injured friend. 
&quot;Utena-sama...are you all right? Do you need help?&quot; &quot;No, Wakaba-chan. 
I&#146;m fine, just...a few pains. Nothing to get to excited about.&quot; The 
cut in the prince&#146;s lip was slowly spilling forth her crimson colored 
blood and it dripped down her chin.

&quot;Ah! Utena-sama! You&#39;re bleeding! Here...&quot; The small, chestnut-headed 
girl pulled her scarf off her uniform and held it to Utena&#146;s mouth.

&quot;Un...thanks, Wakaba-chan.&quot; A blush crossed the young girl&#146;s cheeks. 
She felt good being able to be the one to help her popular best 
friend. Shyly, she nuzzled her nose into the pink-haired girl&#146;s bare 
neck, but stopped suddenly.

&quot;What the hell is going on here!? This wasn&#39;t a game, it was a fight!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Wakaba-chan?&quot;

&quot;Who did this to you!?&quot; Wakaba&#146;s face showed visible anger and she 
must have really been mad to swear.

&quot;Did what?&quot; Utena was a little startled, but kept it hidden.

&quot;Your neck! The back of your neck is badly bruised! Did you fall? Did 
someone hit you?&quot; Wakaba was a little more than concerned and it was 
etched all over her face, practically in stone.

&quot;Oh, well, I had an accident at the face-off. I got...pushed.&quot; The 
anger wasn&#39;t visible in the Oji&#146;s face, but Wakaba could sense it.

&quot;Who?&quot; The Prince was silent for a moment, but before she could 
answer...

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so worried, young lady. Tenjou-kun is quite strong. She 
doesn&#39;t need your help.&quot; ...Utena cringed as she watched her cheating, 
mouthy, egotistical rival place his hand on her best friend&#146;s tiny 
shoulder.

&quot;Don&#39;t you touch her!&quot; The enraged prince slapped the boy&#146;s hand away 
from Wakaba as she positioned herself between the two. Though the pain 
burned in her neck and face, she wouldn&#39;t let her cruel rival see her 
weakness.

&quot;Utena-sama...what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Wakaba was visibly confused. &quot;What&#39;d he 
do?&quot;

&quot;He&#146;s a sarcastic, egotistical, cheating, blowhard. Stay away from 
him, Wakaba.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t...Wakaba-san, is it? Yeah, shouldn&#39;t she be the one to 
judge me, Tenjou-kun?&quot; Keingo was amused by this spectacle. &quot;By the 
way...how&#39;s your face? I didn&#39;t think I threw the ball that 
hard...either that or you&#39;re just really slow.&quot; The features on 
Utena&#146;s face twisted angrily as she stood up quickly and balled her 
fists.

&quot;Utena-sama! C&#146;mon, let&#39;s just get out of here. It&#146;s not worth it.&quot; 
The clenched teeth of the angry prince released and her tense 
shoulders relaxed. She knew she couldn&#39;t fight this jerk...as much as 
she&#39;d love to...but what would the student body, who idolized her so, 
think of her if she were punished by the council members for fighting 
with a council member? With a sigh, the mentally victorious girl 
turned her back to the boy and walked away with Wakaba, her own arm 
placed around the Victor&#39;s waist comfortingly.

&quot;Hmmph! Hey, Tenjou-kun! Why you gotta break that poor girl&#146;s heart!? 
You obviously got many girlfriends...the whole female student body!? 
Or am I mistaken!? That purple headed girl sure seems attached to you, 
too! Whatta shame!&quot; Keingo laughed out loud and headed for the boy&#146;s 
showers, chanting &#145;Playboy&#146; over and over.

&quot;For your information, Himemiya-san is Utena-sama&#146;s steady!&quot;

&quot;Wakaba! No!&quot; She quickly clasped a ringed hand over her friend&#146;s 
mouth to silence her. Fortunately, it appeared he didn&#39;t hear her.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the last thing I want him to know. That jerk will do anything 
to humiliate someone, it seems.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry about that, Utena-sama. I guess I wasn&#39;t thinking about 
what I was saying because I was so mad at him.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I just don&#39;t want him doing something to hurt 
Himemiya. I love her so much that I&#146;m afraid I&#39;d do something to get 
back at him, then I&#39;d get expelled for fighting with a 
councilman...and...and...&quot;

&quot;...you&#39;d lose Himemiya-san. I understand.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Wakaba-chan.&quot; The emotionally beaten prince flashed a small 
smile to her best friend and placed the scarf back on her lip. 
Wakaba&#146;s cheeks stained with a blush, then offered her tiny hand to 
the Oji.

&quot;C&#146;mon, Utena-sama, let&#39;s go get some ice for your eye before it gets 
any blacker.&quot;

&quot;Eh? I have a black eye? Oh, Himemiya&#146;s just going to love that.&quot; The 
prince&#146;s pink tresses curtained her face as she placed one ivory tone 
hand over her discolored eye. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Utena-sama. I&#146;m sure Himemiya-san has a miracle cure for 
something like this. She always did before, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, you&#39;re right. Okay, let&#39;s get moving then. The last thing I 
need now is a stupid black eye.&quot; Utena reached out and took the hand 
of the young girl. Not to far off, steam filled the boy&#146;s locker room 
as a wicked grin twisted Shintaro Keingo&#146;s features.

&quot;So, that purple-haired girl is Tenjou-kun&#146;s steady, which obviously 
makes her...Kettou no Shioushia...&quot; He glanced at his Bara no Kokuin 
and smiled fiendishly. &quot;Perhaps I&#146;ll find myself a new girl to serve 
me after all. Guess it&#146;s time to challenge the Victor to a duel.&quot;

Shinohara Wakaba helped her best friend as much as she thought was 
necessary, though Utena often waved it off, not wanting to appear weak 
in the adorable eyes of the one who idolized her so much. The duo 
stood in the elevator, going up to the tower dorm room that the Victor 
and her Bride shared.

&quot;Aww...my neck is so sore. I can&#146;t believe I fell for that cheap 
shot,&quot; Utena thought with disappointment. Her ringed hand came up to 
rub the bruise that had developed there, but she found the effort 
useless as she winced in pain every time she attempted to touch it.

&quot;Ne, Utena-sama...we&#39;re here.&quot;
&quot;Eh? Oh, we are.&quot;

&quot;Hurry up! Not much longer and you&#39;ll be better again.&quot; With a nod, 
Utena followed her cheerful friend. The chestnut-haired girl bounced 
down the hallway and reached the large dormitory doors.

&quot;Just go on in, Wakaba.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, but hurry up!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes. I&#146;m hurrying...&quot; The pink-haired Victor reached the door 
after Wakaba had passed through it, a feeling of remorse clawed at her 
emotions. &quot;Hey! Himemiya! I&#146;m home!&quot;

&quot;Ah, how was practice, Utena-sama?&quot;

&quot;It was...&quot; Utena started slowly.

&quot;...a disaster!! That new guy was so mean to Utena-sama! He pushed her 
down and threw a basketball at her and made her lip bleed and bruised 
her neck and he made fun of her and called her a &#145;playboy&#146; and...&quot;

&quot;Wakaba-chan! Breathe!&quot; The prince&#146;s hand covered the rambling girl&#146;s 
mouth.

&quot;Utena-sama...is all this true? Did you fight with him?&quot;

&quot;No, No...we were practicing and he basically did what he could to 
cheat. I was a little slow, though. I didn&#39;t think fast and I caught 
the ball with my face.&quot; A humiliated blush burned the Victor&#39;s face as 
she unbuttoned her black jacket and threw it on her bed. &quot;Wakaba 
informed me that I have quite a bruise on my neck...&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama, did he strike you!?&quot;

&quot;No, I told you, he cheated. At the face-off, he pushed me and I 
landed on my neck.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll go get some ice for your eye, Utena!&quot; Wakaba exited the room 
quickly, her small ponytail bouncing against her head. Anthy waited 
until she was gone before she spoke again.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t your coach do anything about this?&quot;

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know. I suppose he may have missed it. It&#146;s no big deal.&quot; 
The features on Anthy&#39;s face faltered at her Victor&#39;s reply. 

&quot;You were distracted, weren&#39;t you?&quot; The prince was hesitant, but a 
worried glance from Anthy forced Utena to merely nod and cast her 
cobalt eyes downward in humiliation. &quot;I see. Please be careful. I have 
a very bad feeling about this boy.&quot;

&quot;I will, Himemiya. Until then, I think I need to lie down...I have 
such a headache.&quot;

&quot;All right...would you like me to rub your shoulders, first, 
Utena-sama?&quot;

&quot;Well...okay. Be gentle, though. I&#146;m really tender there, right now.&quot; 
The emerald-eyed princess nodded and took her prince by the shoulders, 
seating her on the bed. Her slender, tanned hands remained on the 
Oji&#146;s shoulders as she, too, seated herself on the bed, behind Utena, 
and began to gently rub the pain.

&quot;Oh, Does it hurt?&quot;

&quot;Ah...no, of course not. It feels really good.&quot; Utena craned her neck 
forward, letting her carnation locks hide her face. The healing touch 
of Anthy&#39;s hands worked their way toward the purple and blue bruise 
that plagued the lower-back of the prince&#146;s slender neck. 

&quot;Ah! Ouch! Please, stop it!&quot; The prince&#146;s eyes shut tight as she 
arched her back to escape the pain.

&quot;Ah...I am sorry. You have a knot in it. It won&#39;t hurt as much if you 
let me knead it out.&quot;

&quot;...but...it hurts.&quot; Utena&#146;s face turned to look pleadingly at the 
gentle eyes of the Bride. The pitiful look of a pained child was all 
Anthy could see beneath her Victor&#39;s usually strong exterior. 

&quot;It&#39;ll only hurt for a little while...I promise I&#146;ll be as gentle as I 
can, but I don&#39;t want you to hurt even more if it stays there.&quot; 
Defeated by fact, the childlike expression of Utena softened a little 
as she nodded. &quot;I&#146;ll stop for a moment if it hurts too much, okay?&quot;

&quot;Y...yeah...&quot; Tenjou Utena braced for contact as her Bride&#39;s hands 
softly touched the large, purple spot and began to carefully knead it. 
&quot;Unn...Owww...&quot; Desperately, she tried not to pull away from the 
agonizing pain. A sorrowful frown changed Anthy&#39;s expression as she 
heard the tiny gasps and choked-back cries from the prince.

&quot;Sorry about that, Utena-sama. If it hurts that much, I&#146;ll stop.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay...I&#146;m being childish. It does hurt, but go ahead and finish 
it...&quot; Anthy proceeded to work out the painful knot, but could sense 
more relief in the Victor&#39;s voice. A smile curled the corners of the 
Hanayome&#146;s lips, her mind in thought. Slowly, her face came to the 
side of the Prince&#146;s neck, her breath danced over it softly.

&quot;Does it still hurt?&quot;

&quot;A little...please don&#39;t stop...it&#146;s feeling better.&quot; Only, Utena 
wasn&#39;t speaking of the bruise as much as the warm feeling of Anthy&#39;s 
soft breath on her bare neck. Each one sent a chill throughout the 
Shioushia&#146;s body. Next, a soft pair of lips touched her jaw-line and 
moved up to the top of her ear. A kiss, a breath, a rub of the neck, 
and a sigh from the Victor. The pattern was followed many times over, 
neither girl noticing the moonlight they were being bathed in as the 
night rose over Ohtori Gakuen. The pain began to go unnoticed, but the 
bruise remained beneath Anthy&#39;s gentle touch. A soft sigh escaped 
Utena&#146;s slightly parted lips as the relief flooded her body. Oh, 
Kamisama, how it felt good. 

&quot;Utena-sama...I could work your shoulders easier if your shirt&#39;s 
straps weren&#39;t in the way. Do you mind?&quot; Utena&#146;s eyes opened quickly 
as she felt herself unconsciously nodding...and Anthy&#39;s hands lifting 
the ash-purple tank top over her head. The ocean colored eyes of Utena 
went down to reveal her own nudity, save for her red shorts. The blush 
on the bridge of her nose and cheeks matched those shorts identically.

&quot;Hey, hey...Hi...Himemiya...&quot; Her tongue tripped over her words, 
making her stutter shyly. Nothing was said from the Bride, only her 
hands coming back to rub the Prince&#146;s shoulders once more. 
&quot;Ahh...Kamisama...such soft hands.&quot; The slender, ivory backside of 
Utena could be witnessed even in the shadows of the moonlight. The 
Bara no Hanayome could practically feel her hands begging to trace the 
outline of that curvaceous back. Himemiya Anthy felt a strange 
courageousness as her left hand began to travel down the center and 
all the way to the small of the Prince&#146;s back. Such soft skin, made of 
the finest ivory-colored silk. 

&quot;...so soft, Utena-sama...so smooth...&quot; The Bride pushed the Victor 
onto her stomach in the bed, taking her hair and moving it away from 
the bare back. What a sight to behold for a young girl such as 
Himemiya Anthy...bold, brave, romantically intoxicated, Himemiya 
Anthy. She brought her lips to the back of Utena&#146;s neck and kissed it. 
In suit, she kissed each shoulder blade. The Prince didn&#39;t move, just 
released relaxed sighs. The Hanayome&#146;s cheek brushed against the silky 
texture of Utena&#146;s slender back, a sigh of her own escaping her lips. 

&quot;...Himemiya...&quot; Utena breathed through a sigh. Oh yes, it was 
Himemiya. The Prince could take it no longer as she pushed herself 
onto her forearms and turned over. The slight chill in the air 
striking her front, making the sight just as pleasurable for the 
Bride. Tenjou Utena lied on her back, a pillow behind her head, and 
carnation tresses spilling about it. She pulled the Bride into her 
embrace and took one of her hands in her own, bringing it to her lips 
and kissing each individual fingertip. Before too long, Anthy&#39;s lips 
came to Utena&#146;s face and traced her jaw-line until they met the pink 
haired Oji&#146;s lips in a soft, yet desirable, kiss. The young Victor&#39;s 
tongue traced the outline of the Bride&#39;s slowly, her own just pausing 
briefly to savor the tingling feeling. As Utena&#146;s tongue left Anthy&#39;s 
mouth, the Bride let her own glide up her protector&#39;s face, 
agonizingly slow, until it reached the horrid, developing black eye. 
The Princess&#39;s lips then came down upon it gently, kissing away the 
pain.

&quot;Fear not, Utena-sama...I promise I will make everything better. No 
more pain.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Himemiya...nor will their be anymore with you.&quot;

The young lovers who tried fate and played the game of revolution 
found this to be an inseparable bond. How could anything, or anyone, 
so cruel come between them? Another kiss shared, another embrace held, 
and the night proceeded. Touch after heart-stopping touch did nothing 
but pleasure the senses of the Prince and her Princess. The hands of 
the Hanayome gripping ivory tightly as crimson lips kissed their way 
down Utena&#146;s neck, stopping to let her tongue trace the Oji&#146;s 
collarbone. The tongue soon replaced with lips that traveled down 
further, just above the sensitive Victor&#39;s breast. Emerald-green 
locked with cobalt-blue, questioningly. Utena merely nodded once, 
giving the Bride her much anticipated permission. Anthy&#39;s lips 
continued to kiss down, down, in the path of a perfectly shaped 
breast.

&quot;I...I can&#146;t...I can&#146;t go on, Utena-sama. I&#146;m...just too afraid.&quot; The 
Prince sat up suddenly as her Bride pulled away, closing her eyes.

&quot;Why...what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Utena took Anthy&#39;s smaller frame in her arms and 
held her there. The disappointment not as painful as the fact of 
knowing her princess was afraid.

&quot;Just...bad memories. I&#146;m really, truly, sorry.&quot; The Princess looked 
away in shame. Despite the confessions of affection, poor Himemiya 
Anthy could not fight the demons of her past. Oh, how she wished she 
could, but sometimes, fear just outdoes bravery...and one too many 
times in the Hanayome&#146;s mind.

&quot;It&#146;s all right, Himemiya. I&#146;ll never pressure you into such things. I 
promise. We&#39;ll work this out together though, okay?&quot; The Prince tipped 
the shamed Bride&#39;s head up at the chin and placed a small kiss on her 
forehead.

&quot;I&#146;ll try, Utena-sama. Oh, how I want to, but I just can&#146;t. It&#146;s so 
hard.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. Don&#39;t worry, I&#146;m here for you.&quot; The Kettou no 
Shioushia lied back down, taking the Bride down in her embrace, 
kissing her once again on each closed eye, and staying awake until the 
Princess fell fast asleep in her arms.

&quot;Oyasumi nasai...Boku na Bara no Hanayome.&quot; Before long, the Kettou no 
Shioushia, too, was asleep. Their romantic escapade had begun and 
ended in the privacy of their own room...except for the figure 
standing behind the door to the dorm, peeking through the small crack.

&quot;I never would have imagined you could be so bold, Anthy. Too bold, 
perhaps.&quot; Ohtori Akio turned, silently closing the door and returning 
to his own room. &quot;Though, I worry not, for it&#39;ll only be a matter of 
time before Shintaro challenges Utena. If he defeats her, the power of 
Dios will surely follow. She won&#39;t turn the power over, but with some 
persuasion, Keingo definitely will. His victory will also be mine. I 
can break the spirit of Tenjou, make her mine, and then gain the power 
of World Revolution from her.&quot;

Author&#146;s useless babble:

Okay, okay, okay...I read back through this and can&#146;t believe that I&#146;M 
the one who wrote it. I&#146;m like....&quot;what happens next!?&quot; and it&#146;s 
like...oh yeah...my fic. I&#39;m a dork...Heh! This was actually put out a 
lot faster then anticipated. It&#146;s been done for ages, but I needed to
