------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Do you still have that uniform?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;

&quot;You still wear it?&quot;

&quot;Only on a special occasion.&quot;

&quot;I bet the guys at Tokyo U like it, huh?&quot;

Utena laughed at Ukoji&#39;s wry comment. &quot;Yeah. The professors handle it, 
but I think I have at least 5 guys drooling at me!&quot; They all laughed.

After much hugging and crying, all three now sat in the kitchen. Three 
half-empty teacups stood in the center of the table as they talked, 
Chu-Chu happily munching on a cookie as he sat on Utena&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;So, what are you studying there? I remember you saying something about 
being a teacher.&quot; Ukoji asked as he sipped his tea. Utena nodded.

&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m getting a Masters in teaching. Right now, I&#39;m a student 
teacher. When they gave me a choice on which school to go to, they 
mentioned Ohtori, and... well, here I am.&quot;

Anthy said &quot;So, if you teach here for a while, you&#39;ll pass?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Until the end of this semester, and the beginning of next.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re going to help with the students? That&#39;s cool.&quot;

&quot;Well, wherever they need me.&quot;

Ukoji smiled. &quot;You&#39;ve...changed, Utena.&quot; At that quote, Anthy couldn&#39;t 
agree more.

Utena&#39;s hair was pulled back into a ponytail, which seemed to give a 
sort of masculine effect to her face. Her body seemed leaner, more 
powerful, and more muscular, than before, with curves in all the right 
places. She wore a white t-shirt, black boots, and black jeans. The 
jeans &amp; t-shirt were tightly accentuating her form, too tightly for 
Anthy&#39;s comfort. All she could think of was seeing that body naked...her 
hair splayed behind her...that flawless, now lightly tanned skin in 
contrast with her own dark skin...and those beautiful, long, elegant 
fingers teasing her, bringing her to the highest point of ecstasy, 
taking her, and sliding deep inside her hot, wet, throbbing--

&quot;Anthy? Hello! Anyone in there?&quot;

Anthy snapped out of her fantasy. &quot;Huh?&quot; Ukoji groaned in frustration.

&quot;Geez; I swear you get more annoying everyday! Utena just asked you a 
question!&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Anthy turned to her friend. &quot;Sorry. What did you say?&quot;

&quot;Does the Council still...duel?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes. We still hold duels.&quot;

&quot;Are you still the &#39;prize&#39;?&quot;

Anthy felt no surprise at the spark of anger that flashed momentarily in 
Utena&#39;s eyes. She recalled how she had protested that Anthy had no right 
to be considered a &quot;prize&quot;, as Saionji put it. &quot;No. I&#39;m...not. We duel 
for privileges, such as--&quot;

&quot;Such as using the private pool &amp; spa.&quot; Ukoji interjected. &quot;Also for use 
of the lounge, free drinks; that kind of stuff. Very useful.&quot; he said 
with a grin.

&quot;I see.&quot;

At first, Ukoji couldn&#39;t put his finger on it, but now he could tell 
something was gnawing away at Utena. Something important.

&quot;Utena, is there something you want to tell us? There&#39;s something 
gnawing at you; I can tell. Out with it.&quot;

The former duelist looked up from fiddling with her teacup. She sighed. 
&#39;Guess I better tell &#39;em.&#39;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been having a strange dream.&quot; Without waiting for a 
question, she began telling them.

&quot;I&#39;m standing in a field of white roses, like the ones here at the 
Academy. Suddenly, a big, black, withered rose blooms in the field&#39;s 
middle, and all the roses around it start withering and dying. It gets 
closer and closer to where I&#39;m standing. All of a sudden, another rose 
blooms in front of me. The strange thing was that it was a red rose and 
a pink rose growing out of the same stem.&quot; She stopped to take a sip of 
tea, then continued.

&quot;The dying roses stop in front of it, and they start growing and coming 
back to life. The big black one falls, and just crumbles to dust, then 
the wind blows it away.&quot;

All through Utena&#39;s narrative, the other two stayed silent...and amazed. 
&#39;That&#39;s the same dream I&#39;ve been having!&#39; Anthy thought. &#39;How could 
she--&#39;

&quot;There&#39;s something else. I think I...I think I saw him.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Anthy asked, her mouth dry with fear.

&quot;Akio.&quot;
