<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Another day, another encounter with the student body. The mob of 
hopeless romantics flocking around their idol and her mysterious 
shadow. The tired expression on the prince&#146;s face was plainly visible, 
but she still managed to greet the crowd of idol-stricken girls. When 
the two entered the halls, which weren&#146;t as crowded as the outdoors, 
they looked to one another. The deafening silence of the locker halls 
was nerve wracking. Boldly enough, the young velvet trussed Bride took 
her Victor&#146;s hand and gave it a light squeeze.

&quot;Sorry about that, Utena-sama. I shouldn&#146;t have kept you up so late 
last night.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry about it. I&#146;ll be okay. I&#146;m not that tired. Besides, I 
wanted to stay up, anyway.&quot;

&quot;You did...?&quot; The Hanayome was taken aback. Someone actually wanted to 
stay with her, unlike the countless Victors of the past who just used 
and abused her for her title. Himemiya Anthy couldn&#146;t help but smile 
warmly.

&quot;Of course I did! Why wouldn&#146;t I? Hasn&#146;t anybody ever stayed up with 
you just for the hell of it?&quot;

&quot;Well...no. I&#146;m not used to this kind of affection. Except from my 
brother.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re brother? Akio-san?&quot;

&quot;Ah...well...I guess so.&quot; Anthy&#146;s response was hesitant, but quick to 
change the subject. &quot;How&#146;s your neck, by the way?&quot;

&quot;Oh, much better. Thank you.&quot; The Prince rubbed the back of her neck 
to prove it, a smile on her slender face before she held her Bride&#146;s 
hand tighter and kissed her cheek, lightly. 

&quot;Ah...y...you&#146;re...welcome.&quot; Anthy blushed unnoticeably and brushed 
her hand over her cheek as she and Utena walked around the corner.

&quot;Morning, Utena-sama!!&quot;

&quot;Morning, Wakaba!&quot; The pink-headed girl waved to her best friend who 
turned the corner down the hall at the same time the Bride and Victor 
did.

&quot;Are you well? How&#146;s your neck, today? Not painful I hope.&quot;

&quot;Nah, it&#146;s much better, now. Compliments of Himemiya of course. By the 
way, what happened to you last night? I don&#146;t even remember you taking 
off.&quot;

&quot;Oh...well, I went to go and get some ice for your eye. I couldn&#146;t 
find any at your dorm building, but I knew I had some. When I was 
coming back, Touga-sempai told me that it was after hours and told me 
to go back to my dorm. I tried telling him what happened...but he 
wouldn&#146;t listen. I was so mad at him. Sorry, Utena-sama.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#146;s okay. Himemiya helped me with it. I wouldn&#146;t want you to get 
into trouble for sneaking out. Thanks for helping me out yesterday, 
though.&quot; The prince kissed the smaller girl on the forehead, making 
her blush, but her smile was more noticeable.

&quot;At least your black eye isn&#146;t very bad, anymore.&quot;

&quot;Nope...it&#146;s going away pretty fast.&quot;

&quot;Good. It makes you look awful.&quot;

&quot;Um...thanks...I guess.&quot;

&quot;Well, Utena-sama, I&#146;m going ahead to class. I&#146;ll see you both there!&quot; 
The ocean-eyed prince watched as the chestnut-headed girl disappeared 
around a corner, a &#145;cheerful&#146; little smile on her small face.

&quot;You&#146;re fortunate to have such a friend to watch over you, 
Utena-sama.&quot;

&quot;Yes...she&#146;s a good girl.&quot; Her rose-pink lips turned slowly upright as 
she turned and opened her locker. An expression opposite of her 
previous quickly crossed her features. &quot;What&#146;s all this?&quot; Utena&#146;s eyes 
looked a little disturbed as she backed away from the open door to 
reveal a wilted, ivory-white rose lying within. It&#146;s long, thorny stem 
was torn in half and below it lied a letter with a wax seal bearing 
the sign of the Cache of the Rose on it.

&quot;What is it Utena-sama?&quot; The Prince reached in and picked up the 
letter, cautiously, knowing in the back of her mind what it was, 
exactly. Her eyes glanced at the wax seal and looked to her Bride 
sadly.

&quot;It&#146;s a challenge...and it&#146;s been a long time, too.&quot;

&quot;From whom?&quot; The Bride stepped behind Utena, trying to see who had the 
nerve to challenge the Victor of the Duel after such a long time 
without duels. Before Anthy could even finish reading, the Prince&#146;s 
hand crumpled the letter, fiercely, an angered expression twisting her 
features.

&quot;Shintaro...Keingo. He&#146;s challenged me to a duel.&quot;

&quot;Oh, when will he stop?&quot; The Bride groaned.

&quot;I...don&#146;t know, but I&#146;ve got a really bad feeling about this.&quot; A 
black clad arm dropped lifelessly to Utena&#146;s side, the wadded up paper 
falling to the floor.

&quot;...Utena-sama...&quot; The Bride came to the Prince&#146;s side and wrapped her 
arm around the now-challenged girl&#146;s waist, resting her purple trussed 
head on a black coated shoulder. Utena&#146;s hand wrapped around the 
Princess&#146; waist and pulled her closer, tilting her head to rest upon 
Anthy&#146;s.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry, Himemiya. It&#146;s going to be all right. I&#146;ll duel him 
without flaw. I refuse to lose you to such a person.&quot;

&quot;He&#146;ll cheat, Utena-sama, just like he has been doing.&quot;

&quot;I won&#146;t fall for his tricks so easily. What he&#146;ll gain from dueling 
with me, I don&#146;t know, but you&#146;re one &#145;prize&#146; he won&#146;t gain. You won&#146;t 
be anyone&#146;s prize. Not anymore.&quot;

&quot;Please, Utena-sama, don&#146;t say such things if you feel they&#146;ll be 
difficult to do, you&#146;ll just be further distracted.&quot;

&quot;I understand and I&#146;ll try, but this may be what we need to get him 
off our backs.&quot;

&quot;Just...be very careful. I don&#146;t want to lose you.&quot;

&quot;You won&#146;t. I&#146;ll do whatever it takes so I won&#146;t lose you either.&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama...if it means you&#146;ll be safe...just throw the fight. I 
don&#146;t want to see you get hurt worse than you were.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll be fine. I have a bigger goal to fight for to give me 
motivation.&quot; The Hanayome&#146;s face faltered at that statement, not quite 
catching Utena&#146;s implication.

&quot;I hope it isn&#146;t to show him up...please don&#146;t be foolish, 
Utena-sama.&quot; Anthy thought to herself as she took the Prince&#146;s hand in 
hers and gave it another tight squeeze.

&quot;C&#146;mon, Himemiya...we&#146;d better get to class.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Utena-sama.&quot;

As the day progressed, a note from the Rijichou was delivered to 
Shintaro Keingo, seeking an audience with him immediately.

&quot;All right, Ohtori-san, what did you need from me?&quot;

&quot;I understand you&#146;ve given a challenge to the Victor of the Duel 
today. What is your soul purpose of this challenge?&quot;

&quot;I...just want the title of Kettou no Shioushia.&quot;

&quot;You do not desire the power of World Revolution?&quot;

&quot;Oh...uh, yeah...that too.&quot; Akio kept his poker face with the boy who 
knew priceless little of the prestigious game of Revolution.

&quot;Do you know what to do with the power once you&#146;ve obtained it?&quot; A 
long pause followed the Rijichou&#146;s question. Keingo&#146;s face faltered 
and he spoke.

&quot;All right, all right! I just want to humiliate Tenjou-kun and gain 
possession of the Bara no Hanayome.&quot;

&quot;I see. In that case...don&#146;t fail. Once you&#146;ve taken the title from 
the current Victor, come see me again and I&#146;ll tell you what to do.&quot;

&quot;All right, I will.&quot;

Tenjou Utena, Kettou no Shioushia, stood, fully uniformed with Dios no 
Ken in her clenched hand. She watched with caution as her Bride...her 
friend...her lover, approached the sickeningly calm Shintaro and 
placed a grayish colored rose in his lapel. The Bride looked straight 
ahead, never making eye contact with the opponent.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry, Bride, it&#146;ll be all over soon. I won&#146;t hurt her...too 
much.&quot;

&quot;Please be fair. This is a duel, not a mere game. Your tricks shall 
not be tolerated in such a serious occurrence.&quot;

&quot;But that takes all the fun out of it.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;ve been told. Do not defy the rules of a duelist of Revolution.&quot; 
They stared at one another at that point, the Bride&#146;s face not 
flinching for even a moment.

&quot;Himemiya...it&#146;s time.&quot; Utena&#146;s voice called to the Hanayome.

&quot;Yes, Utena-sama.&quot; Anthy returned to the reigning Victor and placed an 
ivory-white rose into her lapel, then, after brushing her fingers over 
it lightly, she kissed it and reluctantly took her position on the 
side-lines, expressionlessly frightened of what was about to take 
place. The fate of her future love-life and lover resting on this one 
duel. Across from her, the Victor stood stern, arm held outstretched 
with her blade pointing to her opponent in a sign of readiness.

&quot;I won&#146;t lose...&quot; she told herself. At that moment, two figures broke 
stance and charged for one another, their weapons close at their 
sides. The challenger brought his long sword over his head to strike.

&quot;Offensive duelist...I should have known.&quot; The Victor&#146;s sword swiftly 
crossed her chest to deflect the strike. With an impact that produced 
sparks, the two blades collided. Keingo&#146;s height gave him an advantage 
over the smaller, more slender girl.

&quot;C&#146;mon, Tenjou-kun...I expected more than this...where&#146;s that hellcat 
exterior I love so much about you?&quot; The boy&#146;s sarcasm was all for 
naught though as Utena fought off every slammed emotion thrown at her. 
His mouth twisted into a mocking grin as he threw the rest of his 
weight onto the defensive Utena. The added weight forcing the Prince 
to one knee.

&quot;Dammit...I can&#146;t strike or I&#146;ll be impaled...&quot; Utena&#146;s mind raced 
with options that did nothing for her. &quot;I&#146;m wasting my strength with 
this...gotta take a hit or lose stamina...&quot; Utena&#146;s sky-blue eyes 
clenched tightly as she pushed as hard as she could into her sword and 
threw herself to the side, but taking a blade swipe to her trailing 
leg. She hissed painfully as she rolled out of the way and jumped to 
her feet.

&quot;Pathetic, Tenjou-kun. I could get a better duel out of that weakling 
Bride of yours.&quot; Careless anger twisted the young prince&#146;s features. 
How dare he speak of her love that way. Utena held her sword like a 
bat and ran at Keingo, taking every chance she could to let her blade 
bite into him. On the sidelines, the Bride of the Rose could feel her 
Victor&#146;s outrage. The swift blade kept flying, tearing and cutting the 
ego-stricken boy. The fast moving arms of Utena brought one more 
powerful blow down upon the boy&#146;s blade, both duelists struggling.

&quot;Is this...what you want, Shintaro-kun? I&#146;m fighting you just as you 
requested.&quot; The carnation-headed Oji&#146;s face revealed an angered blush 
that spread across her cheeks like wildfire.

&quot;This isn&#146;t...what I want. Please, Tenjou-kun...spare my dignity!&quot;

&quot;There is no mercy in the game of Revolution. Rules...are...rules. You 
should have thought of that before becoming a duelist.&quot; Utena pulled 
away and quickly brought her gleaming sword to Keingo&#146;s rose in a 
side-stroke, the blade coming to the vulnerable target of 
victory...and then...a painful gasp.

&quot;Utena-sama!!&quot; Anthy&#146;s cry rang out through the arena as the Victor 
cried out and fell backwards. The Hanayome rushed into the crossfire 
to her prince, only to be pushed to the ground by an arm.

&quot;Stay back or forfeit, Bride.&quot; Keingo said threateningly. Himemiya&#146;s 
emerald green eyes looked to her prince with deep concern.

&quot;Don&#146;t...interfere...Himemiya...or I&#146;ll be forced to...forfeit.&quot; The 
Bara no Hanayome brought a hand to her mouth, desperately fighting the 
urge to run and take her Prince away from here. The sight of the girl 
who fought for her, lying on the ground, still gripping her sword in 
one hand, her other clutching her stomach wound...what could the 
frightened Bride do? A silent cry of &#145;Utena-sama...please be all 
right...&#146; was all she could think of without risking an interference. 
Anthy&#146;s hand gripped the collar of her gown tightly, mentally begging 
for Utena&#146;s safety. The prince lied on the ground, beads of sweat 
forming on her brow as her opponent&#146;s sword pointed threateningly at 
her rose.

&quot;C&#146;mon, Tenjou-kun...is that all you got?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s more than you&#146;ll ever have...&quot; Utena&#146;s face was a mask of hidden 
pain. A person such as Shintaro Keingo did not deserve to have the 
satisfaction of seeing his opponent in her pain.

&quot;Well, Tenjou-kun, I beg to differ...&quot; As quickly as he finished 
speaking, his arm was a blur in the air, coming back to strike the 
grounded prince. The sword of Keingo came harshly upon the 
Prince&#146;s...own sword. &quot;Give it up, you don&#146;t got anything left!&quot;

&quot;Oh...don&#146;t I?&quot; A small smirk could be seen as Utena&#146;s leg came up and 
connected with the amateur duelist&#146;s stomach, pushing him away, but 
not before his arm flung wildly, sword striking the grounded girl 
lightly across the left side of her face, then, Keingo hit the ground, 
gasping for breath. Utena rested upon one knee, a hand over her left 
eye, slowly tracing the cut that went from above her eyebrow and down 
to the tip of her cheekbone. Fortunately, though, the blade narrowly 
missed slicing the Prince&#146;s eye. 

&quot;Very...good come come-back, Tenjou-kun...&quot; the sarcasm dripped like 
venom from his voice, nothing new to Utena, though. Keingo lied on the 
ground, his sword at his side.

&quot;I don&#146;t believe in kicking one when they&#146;re down...get up, now...or 
forfeit.&quot; The Prince&#146;s eyes stared with an unfamiliar coldness at the 
boy, this heartless, selfish boy, his own eyes staring back, not 
directly into Utena&#146;s eyes, but rather the bloody cut on her face. 
Crimson seeped slowly out of the paper-thin wound, as if she were 
crying tears of blood.

&quot;You&#146;re very noble, Tenjou...&quot; The challenger rose to one knee, 
slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out a thin cloth, damp 
with rubbing alcohol and crushed salt crystals. Keingo kept his back 
to the Oji as he took his sword into his hand, the other gripping the 
cloth. &quot;All right, Tenjou, bring it on.&quot; The two ran toward one 
another at a flash of break-neck speed, their shimmering blades 
colliding together once again. 

&quot;We...can&#146;t keep going like this...try a different attack...this is 
just too predictable.&quot;

&quot;Good thinking for once, Tenjou-kun...I&#146;ll just end it, now!&quot; 

&quot;Eh!?&quot; Keingo&#146;s arm pulled his sword back and, as expected, Utena&#146;s 
eyes followed. His plan now going perfectly, he brought his other hand 
out and slapped her across the face with the soaked cloth so quickly 
she didn&#146;t even figure out what had hit her...except that it really 
hurt...excruciatingly. The salt and alcohol burned into the Prince&#146;s 
open cut and stung her. &quot;What the hell is this!? It stings!!&quot; The 
partially blinded duelist kept one hand over her eye and fought feebly 
with the other. &quot;Damn you!&quot; From afar, the Bara no Hanayome had been 
in a position that disabled her from seeing the illegal strike, but 
she could see that the Victor was struggling...just from her cut 
perhaps?

&quot;Oh, Utena-sama...what&#146;s going on over there?&quot; Tenjou Utena jumped 
aside, fighting off the stinging pain in her eye and the cut.

&quot;I won&#146;t forgive you for taking advantage of the duels of Revolution!&quot; 
The Prince opened her eyes as best as she could and ran to the boy, a 
loud cry escaping her lips as she raised her sword and took her 
strike. A grunt from the boy was heard, followed by a sharp clang, and 
a trail of falling rose petals. Utena looked to her opponent, then to 
her weapon, which had been deflected against a hidden dagger. Keingo 
turned slightly, letting Utena&#146;s good eye catch a glimpse of the 
unscathed rose in his lapel. The bells sounded...and Dios no Ken 
vanished from Utena&#146;s hand.

&quot;Looks like I&#146;m the Victor of the Duel, now, Tenjou-kun.&quot;

&quot;No...way...I&#146;ve...been beaten? This isn&#146;t happening! You cheated me!&quot; 
The carnation-pink haired girl was taken aback. How could...this be? 
On the sideline of the arena, a heartbroken tear trickled down the 
slender cheek of Himemiya Anthy. Reluctantly, she walked to the center 
of the platform.

&quot;The Sekai no Hate have declared Shintaro Keingo-sama...the new Kettou 
no Shioushia.&quot;

&quot;No! Himemiya, please!! Tell me you saw him do it! Tell me you saw him 
take an illegal strike! His hand came in contact with my wounds, 
deliberately! He should have been disqualified!&quot; The crystalline tears 
began to shimmer in the defeated girl&#146;s eyes as she begged for a 
recall.

&quot;I&#146;m...afraid I cannot prove that. It wasn&#146;t seen by the Sekai no 
Hate, nor myself. I&#146;m sorry, Tenjou...san.&quot;

&quot;Himemiya, I won&#146;t let him take you away! A cheater does not deserve 
such a power as that of Dios!&quot; Keingo approached the outraged girl and 
placed a hand on her shoulder, his usual, annoying grin plastered on 
his face.

&quot;Hey, hey, Tenjou-kun, be a good sport about this, huh? I won and it&#146;s 
official. Just admit that you&#146;re the loser.&quot;

&quot;...loser...? I am not a loser! I was not fairly defeated! Please, 
Himemiya, I wouldn&#146;t lie about something like this. You know that!&quot; 
Utena&#146;s eyes looked pleadingly to her friend and lover. 

&quot;Please, Tenjou-san...I cannot prove it. Shintaro-sama is the Victor, 
now. Let it go, I&#146;m begging you. You&#146;re hurt, but you&#146;re alive, so 
please go and heal.&quot; Like Utena, the Bride&#146;s eyes shone with unshed 
tears, only Utena&#146;s were now flowing down her cheeks as she received 
her anguished lover&#146;s response. With trembling legs, the Prince stood 
and walked to Anthy, placing a ringed hand upon the red-clad girl&#146;s 
shoulder.

&quot;Himemiya...don&#146;t go...please...&quot; her oceanic eyes looked with longing 
at the Hanayome&#146;s emerald ones, a look that silently shattered Anthy&#146;s 
fragile heart like a stone through stained glass.

&quot;Tenjou...Utena-sa...&quot;

&quot;Back up, Tenjou-kun! I&#146;m the Kettou no Shioushia, now! Your 
manipulation of the Bara no Hanayome will only further trouble you in 
the likes of me!&quot; Keingo forcefully grabbed Anthy&#146;s other shoulder and 
pulled her away, his action followed by a harsh slap in the previous 
Victor&#146;s face which sent her backpedaling. The Bride&#146;s eyes widened 
frighteningly. Abusive!? No, not another one. It was true, though. The 
Bride of the Rose was in possession of another abusive Victor, and he 
wasn&#146;t abusing her, for once, but Utena, who did not deserve it. 

&quot;Shintaro-sama, please, don&#146;t strike her! She&#146;s visibly hurt! Leave 
her be, I&#146;m begging you...please...&quot; Listening to her true Bride speak 
to this degrading boy in such formality drove a spike through Utena&#146;s 
already broken heart. Her ringed hand touched her reddened face that 
possessed yet another burning pain. This was too much!

&quot;Give her back! Shintaro Keingo...you&#146;re a selfish liar and a cheater! 
I won&#146;t allow you to take her from her freedom!&quot; A smirk spread on the 
new &#145;Victor&#146;s&#146; face as he turned to Utena.

&quot;Freedom? She never had any as the Bride. Go home, Tenjou-kun. You 
really should go get those wounds examined on the way.&quot;

&quot;I will not surrender! Himemiya is not a prize to be won, anymore!&quot; 
The Prince&#146;s eyes locked on the Bride. &quot;Be free, Himemiya!! Don&#146;t 
surrender your life to someone like him! If you ever truly loved 
me...and forgive me for being so forward...you&#146;ll just forget about 
him and go about living your life as you choose to!&quot; 

&quot;I can&#146;t. I do love you...but...I&#146;m fated to be the Bara no Hanayome 
forever. I do not deserve such royalties as living a life. Please 
understand. I still love you, Utena-san.&quot; The Bride&#146;s eyes shut sadly 
as she saw her beloved Prince break. Keingo, though, was not pleased 
with his &#145;prize&#146;.

&quot;Bara no Hanayome! I order you to ignore her and you are required to 
obey and serve me! Now, let&#146;s go!&quot; The new Victor took the Bride&#146;s arm 
and began to take her away.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry...Utena-san. Forgive me...&quot; Once reluctant, always 
reluctant, then the Bride followed the boy out of the arena as Utena&#146;s 
knees gave and she dropped to the ground, her black clad arms wrapping 
around her body protectively.

&quot;Himemiya...don&#146;t leave me...please, don&#146;t leave me...&quot; Heart-wracking 
sobs escaped the Prince&#146;s lips as the Bride walked out of her life. 
Her pink tresses dropped over her shoulders, shielding her face. 
Tenjou Utena&#146;s body shook violently as she drew in a heavy breath, 
choked back a sob, and just screamed. &quot;PLEASE, HIMEMIYA!!!&quot; The 
sorrowful cry echoed throughout the arena for countless seconds before 
the defeated Prince doubled over and drew her prone form into a tight 
ball of endless crying. A small figure in a never-ending void of 
nothingness was the girl, so small...and so alone. By now, her ragged 
breathing was the only sound heard. How long had this poor child been 
up here, all alone in her sorrow? 

&quot;Oh...Maboroshi no Shiro ...a Prince&#146;s illusional castle. Something 
I&#146;ve failed at. Some prince I am...I&#146;ve lost my Princess. Why, 
Kamisama...whyyy? Why is she fated to be the Bara no Hanayome? Why 
can&#146;t she be free? Why must she suffer? Why...? ...why...why ...why, 
Why, WHY MUST YOU TORTURE HER SO, FATE!?!?&quot; So strong was this young 
girl to have survived as long as she has with her agonizing stomach 
wound. Weakly, she stood and held her stomach, crimson blood still 
poured forth, freshly, from it, her jacket soaking the red life-fluid 
up. Utena stumbled to the stairway and began to slowly go down, her 
vision blurring from the loss of precious blood. &quot;I...have to get 
help...or I&#146;ll never be able to save her...but...it hurts so bad...&quot; 
Once more, she struggled down the steps and into the Kettou Hiroba no 
Mori, whereupon she collapsed from exhaustion, lying face down on the 
ground beneath the shade of the trees, their shade closing around her 
like the lid to a closing coffin. &quot;I&#146;m so sorry, Himemiya...I tried 
to...save you...but I&#146;ve...failed...&quot; and then, there was darkness.

The Observation Tower of Ohtori Gakuen; the highest point on the 
premises and the building that houses the Victor and the Bride. 

&quot;Nice accommodations. It pays to be Victor. We&#146;ll live a good life 
here, Bride.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Shintaro-sama, but, there is more to being the Kettou no 
Shioushia than winning a servant and a place to live...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, but I&#146;ll worry about that later. By the way, you done 
packing that stuff yet? I want it outta here so I can get settled.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Shintaro-sama...I&#146;m almost finished.&quot; Himemiya Anthy was 
kneeling in front of an open closet, silently sorting through the 
various articles of clothing that belonged to her former Victor and 
packing them away to be hauled off. The Bride&#146;s hand pulled out a 
jacket identical to Utena&#146;s uniform, only this one was worn and torn 
from so many duels of the long forgotten past. Anthy cradled the empty 
jacket in her arms and buried her face in it, taking in the still 
lingering scent of fresh roses.

&quot;What are you doing!? I said pack that junk, not play it! Now, move 
it!&quot; He quickly snatched the article of clothing from the Bride and 
threw it at her, harshly. &quot;C&#146;mon, move!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, Shintaro-sama.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m ordering you to forget about that pathetic little tomboy! I&#146;m the 
Victor and you&#146;ll do as I say! She&#146;s nothing, as you are! Understand!? 
You belong to me, now!&quot;

&quot;Yes, I understand.&quot; The Bride went back to rummaging through the 
closet, taking out the rest of her love&#146;s things and carefully packing 
them away. 

&quot;Finish up...I&#146;ll be back in a few. I&#146;m going to speak with, 
Akio-san.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Shintaro-sama.&quot; With that, the time bomb of a boy left the room 
and Anthy. The Bride saw an advantage and decided it was time to break 
a few rules. She stood and ran to the roll-top desk, pulling from it 
some stationary in which she quickly scribbled a letter onto and 
folded it into four corners. Anthy&#146;s heart raced at the thought of 
Keingo coming back before she&#146;d finished, so she put the rest of the 
paper away and ran back to the closet to finish. &quot;Please, get to 
Utena-sama without haste, little letter. It&#146;s so very important.&quot; The 
Hanayome brought the note to her lips and kissed it once before 
placing it safely in Utena&#146;s bag, hidden from immediate sight. At that 
time, the door opened and Keingo walked in, followed by the 
sickeningly casual face of Akio.

&quot;Anthy, have you finished yet?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Onii-sama. I&#146;ve packed everything...&quot; she said aloud. &quot;...and 
locked the zippers...&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;Only Utena-sama will 
know how to remove them.&quot; A small smile came across her face, but no 
one would have noticed. 

&quot;About time...&quot; Keingo muttered. Akio walked over and took the various 
bags of Utena&#146;s belongings and then exited the room.

&quot;Where&#146;s all that going, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Onii-sama is relocating Tenjou-san to a new dorm, considering she is 
no longer entitled to live with me.&quot; 

&quot;I thought so. Well, since we&#146;re alone, now...&quot; Keingo took the 
Bride&#146;s hand and pulled her to him. Himemiya Anthy followed suit as 
her Victor ordered, though for the first time, with utter regret. 
Regret that she was to be taken advantage of again. Regret that she 
lost her Utena-sama. Regret that she failed to see Keingo&#146;s illegal 
action, yet knowing she could not argue with the decisions of the 
Sekai no Hate. Regret that she was forced to leave her injured Prince 
behind. Regret for not making Utena&#146;s dream of becoming a Prince 
reality...and of course...regret for not sharing her intimacy with her 
love that night. So much regret, yet such a young girl. She busied 
herself with thoughts of those regrets as Keingo deposited the Bride 
on the S-shaped bed and forced the girl into unwilling seduction. 
Another person to steal the poor &#145;slave&#146;s&#146; innocence. A tear, like 
before, found it&#146;s way down her slender face...now, with only one 
important thought on her mind... &quot;...Utena-sama...&quot;
