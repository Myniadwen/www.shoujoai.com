<a href="../utena/kakubara-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Wakaba circled her opponent again. She couldn&#39;t find one opening in his 
defense. The cut on her arm hurt from where he had taken a swipe at 
her, but her rose was still pinned in place. Suddenly, he took a side 
step and stumbled in a crack in the floor. His attention diverted 
Wakaba cried out and lunged.

S.K.U.; Kakumei no Bara:

An Ordinary Star Can Shine; Wakaba&#39;s Rise to the Top!

They stared up at the reflection of Akio, having listened to enough of 
his speech to want to know what he had planned now. Utena kept 
clenching and unclenching her fists. He would pay for what he did to 
her. She would make sure of that. The next moment however, she felt a 
slim hand twin with her own. Dark fingers curled around her lighter 
ones and in turning, deep green eyes looked reassuringly into her blue 
ones. Utena sighed and returned her gaze to the screen.

&quot;Now, lets get on to business shall we Onii-sama.&quot; Kami said while 
holding up a piece of paper. On the screen, Akio nodded his agreement.

&quot;Yes, lets. On the agenda today is figuring out who will be going next 
in the preliminary rounds. Now, we&#39;ve discussed it for quite some time 
and we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that there is really only one logical 
person who should go next. Considering she&#39;s never been a duelist 
before, we felt it would only be fair to test Shinohara-san on her 
qualifications. Therefore; tomorrow evening, Shinohara Wakaba will duel 
for her place in this tournament. Followed the next evening by Kiyoichi 
Saionji, Kaoru Miki, Arisugawa Juri, Kiryuu Touga, Sagara Cross, Chiho 
Saitoh, Tianquing Han, and Megani Kamari.&quot;

Wakaba didn&#39;t hear anything after that. Neither did Utena or Anthy who 
had turned to stare at the girl. She was frozen in place, a terrified 
expression holding the territory. The quivering came a moment later, 
followed by her whisper of &quot;I&#39;m first.&quot; This status held for a minute&#133; 
then she passed out.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wakaba sat in the cafeteria, staring at her lunch. The food she had 
bothered to eat now sat heavily in her stomach. Next to her, Saionji 
stared at the coffee in front of him. Neither really knew what to say.

&quot;Saionji-senpai...&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;...Nothing&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot;

They continued to sit there. Saionji wanting to say something that 
would make her feel better; Wakaba not knowing how to express her 
fears. Before this, she had been very good with expressing her 
emotions; she was like an open book. However, this new world she had 
come into didn&#39;t have tolerance for people who were so open with their 
weaknesses. She couldn&#39;t tell him the truth.

She was afraid

She was ashamed

She was alone

Therefore, she sat there, feeling sad and terrified. Feeling the 
self-doubt creep into her. She was an ordinary girl with no special 
powers or skills. She wasn&#39;t like the others; vibrant shining things 
worthy of others praise. She had been one for a while, but it was just 
an illusion; a temporary polish on the dull platitude that was her 
life.

I can&#39;t win this duel...

...Because I&#39;m nothing.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wakaba stood outside one of the dorms, staring up in to the sky. The 
clouds moved peacefully, fluffy white dots soothing the souls of hectic 
students. There was a commotion some way away and her attention was 
drawn there instead. It was Utena and Anthy. They were talking and 
laughing as they made their way to class. The crowd they were walking 
through obscured their sight enough that they couldn&#39;t see Wakaba, but 
there was no hiding them.

There was a time when I wanted to know what Utena saw in her. I don&#39;t 
know when, but I began to see it after a while. Even if she was 
strange, Anthy WAS special. She shone as Utena did. She shone enough to 
make everyone, even Saionji want her. Wakaba turned and looked into a 
window behind her. Looking in her own reflection. The image she made 
was faint and easy to lose.

Sometimes I wonder...

...If I didn&#39;t have Utena and Saionji to notice me...

...Would I just disappear.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Utena and Anthy finally got to their apartment and relaxed. Utena 
wilted against her chair and ran a hand through her sweaty hair. Anthy 
sat more properly but she was still tired herself. Outside, the still 
summer air hummed with the sound of cicadas.

&quot;Ne Hime, is it just me or are we really busy lately.&quot;

&quot;The other students look up to you.&quot;

&quot;Is that what it is?&quot; Utena said, flicking her wrist out of her hair, 
the sweat beads flying away in glistening arcs. Taking a few strands, 
she looked at the tips and sighed. &quot;Have you ever wish that maybe I 
wasn&#39;t so popular?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean.&quot;

I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just that sometimes with they way people are always 
approaching me; I kind of wish that sometimes I could just disappear.

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

There was a moment of just contemplative silence, then.

&quot;Hey, where&#39;s Chu-chu?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe he went to look at the flowers.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Juri sat against the wall in her room, her head in her hands, her soul 
in turmoil. His name kept looping through her mind, unable to stop and 
unwilling to let go.

&quot;Luka.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t enough that her hunted her and advanced on her when he was 
alive, now he haunted her and built regret now that he was dead.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Juri&quot;

&quot;Bullshit! How could those be your last words? After everything you 
knew, everything you felt; that was it? &#145;Don&#39;t worry.&#39; You made me 
think you were immortal. The great Luka, come back to take back his 
club and save me from my pain. You shouldn&#39;t have come back! You&#39;d 
still be alive today if you had just stayed away! Then we&#39;d both be 
happy.&quot;

&quot;You were never happy Juri, not while Shiori was away and especially 
not after she came back.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mention her name!&quot;

&quot;Why not, I got closer to her than you ever could.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Juri leaped forward and tried to punch him, but quick 
movement on his part ended up with her in his embrace. He held her to 
his chest tightly and stroked her back. She wilted under it all. &quot;I 
hate you.&quot;

&quot;Poor Juri, so used to lying to other people that she&#39;s even begun 
lying to herself. Do you really hate me? Because, if you do I&#39;ll leave; 
I&#39;ll leave you alone and never come back. I&#39;ll stop haunting you 
forever.&quot; He felt Juri&#39;s hands tighten on his jacket and he smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t go, please don&#39;t go. I didn&#39;t want you to leave the first time 
and you just left me alone. Everyone does that. Everyone always leaves 
me alone. No one I ever cared about has ever stayed.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you shut down your emotions?&quot;

&quot;It was just easier that way. If I can&#39;t feel any emotions, then I 
can&#39;t feel pain. I let my club and other activities rule my life and 
just stopped believing in such silly things as love and miracles. Then 
she and you came back and everything went to hell. Tenjou came along 
and reminded me that emotions exist and now I can&#39;t shut them off and 
everything hurts.&quot; She felt lips on her hair and knew they were his.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have caused you pain.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t leave, please.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t, I&#39;ll haunt you forever, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to forget you.&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be alone.&quot;

&quot;Stupid girl, you never were. There are people around you who will 
never leave you. These cherished friends will help you if you let 
them.&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t help me like you did.&quot;

&quot;Alright, if you want me to come back so badly I will.&quot;

&quot;That would take a miracle, you&#39;re dead.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should start believing in miracles.&quot;

&quot;Bullshit.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye Juri.&quot;

Then he was gone, leaving Juri to lean against open air. She tumbled 
forward and was about to hit the floor when her eyes opened. Instead of 
the floor, she was looking across her bed at Sakaya. The other girl 
looked at Juri with a concerned expression.

&quot;I dreamed of him.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to forget him. I&#39;m sorry if that makes you sad.&quot; Sakaya&#39;s 
only response was to pull Juri towards her and hold the fencer tight.

&quot;Then don&#39;t; just let me hold you while I can.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wakaba found herself in front of the atrium. Deciding the flowers would 
be nice to see, she went inside. It was musty inside, yet cool. The 
sprinklers had been on. She walked on further and came upon another 
person. The new deputy trustee chairperson was watering the flowers. 
She leaned over to water some daffodils in a vase. Wakaba walked over 
and looked at the small flowers.

&quot;Why do you water such small common flowers.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think so? I think they&#39;re rather pretty. Isn&#39;t that 
enough reason to water them?&quot;

&quot;But you can find daffodils anywhere. There&#39;s nothing special about 
them.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, it is true that they are rather common; but that doesn&#39;t mean 
that there isn&#39;t anything special about them. They really are pretty 
flowers and you feel good looking at them.&quot;

&quot;Most people like roses better.&quot;

&quot;Roses are pretty too, but they&#39;re not the only flower out there. I 
think people tend to forget that.&quot;

&quot;Most people still like roses best.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know that for sure. Maybe you should try asking people what 
they like.&quot;

&quot;Why do you like daffodils though?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re tough. They can grow anywhere undisturbed. That&#39;s kind of an 
advantage of common flowers, because no one picks them as much they are 
strong and will grow anywhere.&quot; As Kami said it, she plucked a daffodil 
from a vase and put it in Wakaba&#39;s hair. Cupping the girls face she 
looked adoringly at her. &quot;Yes, it does seem to fit.&quot; Then taking the 
vase, she walked over to where the roses grew and placed it dead in the 
center. Even amongst all the beautiful blooms, the simple flowers stood 
out, vibrant in their yellow petals. &quot;Hmm, will you look at that? An 
ordinary flower shines even amongst vibrant ones. Something to think 
about, isn&#39;t it Shinohara-san?&quot; Wakaba just stared at the arrangement 
and nodded.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sayonji was waiting outside of her dorm with a worried look on his 
face. When she walked up, he ran over to her and hugged her. She felt 
the convulsive grip and he shook with worry.

&quot;Where were you? I called to see if you were okay and when no one 
picked up I ran over.&quot;

&quot;I had a lot to think about.&quot;

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad.&quot;

He pulled her away and looked into her face, then noticed the flower in 
her hair. Taking it, he examined it. Twirling it between his fingers, 
he smiled a bit.

&quot;A daffodil.&quot;

&quot;You like them?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, they&#39;re my favorite flowers. Before you laugh, listen. When I 
was a kid; whenever I wanted to get away and just not be with anyone I 
would go to this hill to lay down and just be alone. Daffodils grew all 
over the place and as I would lay down staring at the grass, they would 
make me feel at peace. So, now that I&#39;m almost an adult, I have come to 
prize these over all other flowers. I know it&#39;s strange, but that&#39;s the 
way I feel.&quot;

What he didn&#39;t see was the glistening expression on Wakaba&#39;s face as 
she listened to his words. Something in her heart lifted and a tear 
glistened down her cheek. The next moment, she was throwing herself 
into his chest, holding him tight.

&quot;Thank you Saionji&quot;

&quot;For what?

&quot;For liking ordinary things...&quot;

...Like me

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As Wakaba ascended in the elevator, a look of determination fell upon 
her normal cheerfulness. Her fingers flexed around the Wakazashi that 
Saionji had given her to duel. Arriving at the top, she surveyed her 
surroundings. The arena was still the same. There, across from her was 
another young man. Sweat glistened off his forehead and he quivered as 
if he were cold. He wore the school typical uniform though she wore a 
uniform made by Anthy in the same brown as her hair. After a minute, a 
girl in the schools uniform walked up and pinned their roses to their 
chests.

The duel went fast; both were amateurish, but well prepared. His 
defenses were good. It went on for ten minutes like this.

Wakaba circled her opponent again. She couldn&#39;t find one opening in his 
defense. The cut on her arm hurt from where he had taken a swipe at 
her, but her rose was still pinned in place. Suddenly, he took a side 
step and stumbled in a crack in the floor. His attention diverted 
Wakaba cried out and lunged. Recovering, he turned and readied his own 
arm for a strike. They passed each other and it was only when Wakaba 
stopped that a victor was known. Wakaba stood there with half of her 
rose cut, but it was still there. However, her opponent stared at the 
floor, where the remnants of his entire rose lay.

Meanwhile, Wakaba was also staring down into the cracks in the floor. 
Growing from one of them was a healthy strong daffodil.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the darkness of the chairman&#39;s wing, they lay panting and sweating. 
Their clothes, long lost and forgotten. After a minute of panting and 
mewling, Akio leaned up and stared down at her. He smirked and rested 
his weight on his arms. In the girl&#39;s upturned hand lay a white rose. 
Akio reached behind him and placed the object over the girl&#39;s face.

&quot;you&#39;re mine now.&quot;

As he pulled his hand away, the face of comedy looked at him, the black 
mask smiling up into nothing.

&quot;Of course Akio-sama.&quot;

&quot;Across from the bed sat Kanae with another young lady in her lap. The 
sheet wrapped around them was the only thing keeping them warm. On the 
girl&#39;s face lay the white mask of tragedy. In her hand was a black 
rose. She used the rose to stroke up and down Kanae&#39;s face.

&quot;Do you understand what he has said?&quot;

&quot;Yes Kanae-sama.&quot;

Juri: The day where we dominate this school at last

Juri/Miki/Utena/Anthy/Saionji/Wakaba: Carubu Faiya!! (Club fair for all 
the gaijin in the house)

Utena: EH! Who&#39;s this girl challenging me to a basketball game?

Saionji: Wait a minute, shouldn&#39;t we be worrying about my duel coming 
up?

Utena: Who cares about you Kyouichi!?!

Saionji: Nani!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Author&#39;s note: Yay, I finally wrote chapter 8. It took me forever to 
get the inspiration. I watched Kareshi Kanojyo no Jijyo until I finally 
got it. Haha. Oh yeah someone asked me if there was gonna be a 
gravitation crossover. No no, there are just going to be a lot of 
uncreative puns going on.

Yuki/Souichi: C&#39;mon, my favorite Yaoi couple so far. Than again, seing 
as it&#39;s the only shounen-ai series I&#39;ve ever seen, my pickings are slim

Sagara Cross: Karasu means crow, so he&#39;s going to have that pun thrust 
on him a lot, and it does sound a lit like cross romanjified (my word). 
Sagara is also a name I stole from Sagara Sanossuke from Roruni 
Kenshin.

Chiho Saitoh: One of the more famous people responsible for creating 
Utena. If you&#39;re an Utena fan and have never heard this name before you 
should be slapped with a dead fish.</pre>
