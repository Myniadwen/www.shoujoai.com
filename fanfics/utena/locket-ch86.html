&quot;This all feels very weird,&quot; Sistah Spooky admitted, the brown skinned 
woman in the black cloak, tight top, shorts and mask sitting 
uncomfortably at one of the busy club&#39;s tables.

Mindf**k smiled at her girlfriend wryly, the lovely blonde reaching out 
to pat her hand. &quot;Geing out in public?&quot; she asked gently, &quot;Or recovering 
from losing your powers?&quot;

&quot;A bit of both,&quot; Sistah Spooky admitted, taking that hand and squeezing 
it gently. She looked at Mindf**k tenderly, &quot;Is the inhibitor working?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Mindf**k said with a smile, &quot;if it wasn&#39;t blocking my 
telepathy, I couldn&#39;t even stand to be here.&quot;

&quot;If it starts to hurt, let me know,&quot; Sistah Spooky said firmly, &quot;I love 
you, and I don&#39;t want you to be hurt.&quot;

Mindf**k reached out to stroke her cheek, &quot;I love you too.&quot;

Empowered watched with a dubious look as the blonde in a shimmering 
black bodysuit headed up to the bar with her date. &quot;Man, is it creepy 
seeing Spooky being nice like that,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Ninjette agreed, the slim Asian dressed in her usual 
tiny top and biker shorts, her name written across her ass.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Mahoro smiled cheerfully as the black haired maid hurried down 
the bar, &quot;what can I get you?&quot;

&#39;She reminds me of Maid-man,&#39; Empowered found herself thinking. &quot;Ah, two 
beers?&quot; she managed to ask.

&quot;Coming right up!&quot; Mahoro smiled as she smoothly grabbed the beers and 
tossed them over as Ninjette put the money on the bar.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ninjette gratefully caught the beers, passing one to Empowered 
and keeping one for herself.

&quot;Thanks, &#39;Jette,&quot; Empowered said as she kissed the other woman on the 
cheek.

&quot;That&#39;s not much of a thanks,&quot; Ninjette pouted as they reached their 
corner table.

Empowered wrapped her arms around Ninjette, &quot;Let me do better.&quot; This 
time she pulled Ninjette into a lingering kiss, their bodies pressed 
together hotly.

&quot;Now that&#39;s,&quot; Ninjette said huskily, &quot;more like it.&quot;

Femifist shook her head wryly as she scanned the crowd, her red hair 
flowing down her back, a mask covering her eyes. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I 
ended up here.&quot; she muttered.

&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with a bar?&quot; Ocelotina smiled, her skimpy costume 
barely containing her breasts.

&quot;It&#39;s not exactly the best place for a meeting of female superheroines,&quot; 
Femifist shook her head, &quot;people will get the wrong idea.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Ocelotina asked as she stroked a gloved hand along 
Femifist&#39;s well muscled arm.

&quot;You too?&quot; Femifist blushed.

&quot;Here&#39;s your food,&quot; Keiko said as the boyish young women dropped off 
their order, sliding a plate in front of each of them.

&quot;But I didn&#39;t order...?&quot; Femifist looked confused.

&quot;Capt&#39; Rivet paid,&quot; Keiko explained, &quot;and left orders that everyone&#39;s 
meals are free.&quot; She paused, &quot;Alcohol isn&#39;t covered, regretfully.&quot;

&quot;Darn,&quot; Ocelotina pouted cutely.

&quot;We don&#39;t need to drink that much,&quot; Femifist said virtuously.

Ocelotina laughed as she purred, &quot;Speak for yourself, rowr.&quot;

Meanwhile, May hurried over to where several young women sat 
comfortably, listening to someone sing on stage. Jenny Quarks sang a 
song of love and loss, the Asian woman beautiful and sad as she gazed at 
her friends.

&quot;Could we get some finger food?&quot; Swift asked, her wings folded against 
her back as she smiled, &quot;and another round of beers?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Engineer nodded, her body coated by a shimmering steel skin, 
&quot;and make it a dark ale for me.&quot;

Rose Tattoo just nodded slightly, the enigmatic woman smiling. Her red 
hair shimmered and her body was lush, revealed by the simple one piece 
body suit she wore.

&quot;Are you all right, Miss?&quot; May asked, strangely drawn to the young 
woman.

&quot;She&#39;s mute,&quot; Swift quickly jumped in before Rose could seduce the poor 
woman, &quot;but trust me, she&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; May shook her head to clear it then headed off.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to keep her on a tighter leash,&quot; Engineer sighed as she 
watched her teammate Rose scanning the crowd like a huntress looking for 
prey.

&quot;She&#39;s the spirit of life,&quot; Swift shrugged, &quot;and she seems to mostly 
like expressing it through having sex.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Engineer blushed.

&quot;What happened now?&quot; Jenny asked them as she returned to her seat with a 
bounce in her step, grabbing a glass of water and chugging it.

&quot;Rose nearly seduced that poor waitress,&quot; Swift sighed.

Jenny nodded glumly, &quot;One of us needs to take Rose upstairs and tire her 
out.&quot; She looked around, &quot;Who&#39;s turn is it now?&quot;

&quot;I did it last time,&quot; Swift said quickly.

&quot;I suppose I can take a turn,&quot; Engineer offered, &quot;but can I al least get 
some food first? I&#39;ll need the energy.&quot;

&quot;Too much information,&quot; Jenny sighed.

Jane Vasco shook her head, the redhead listening in to the conversation 
from a table nearby. Known as &#39;Painkiller Jane&#39; she was a adventurer and 
occasional hitwoman for her friends the 22 brides. &#39;This is a very 
strange bar,&#39; she noted, seeing everything from future women to knights 
in armor walking, drinking and even dancing.

&quot;Jane,&quot; the familiar voice sent a chill down her spine, &quot;how good to see 
you.&quot;

Jane turned to see the black haired woman sauntering up to her table, 
the pale woman dressed in a revealing one piece bikini split down the 
middle to reveal her cleavage. &quot;Vampirella?&quot; Jane said weakly.

&quot;You remembered,&quot; Vampirella purred as she took a seat at Jane&#39;s table. 
She casually called, &quot;Waiter!&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Alpha hurried over, the green haired young woman smiling in a 
friendly way.

&quot;I&#39;d like a Bloody Mary with real blood,&quot; Vampirella said casually then 
looked at her companion, &quot;Jane?&quot;

Jane looked a bit startled but recovered fast. &quot;A Screwdriver, please,&quot; 
she said, &quot;and nachos if you have them.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Alpha nodded then looked at Vampirella, &quot;anything for you, 
Miss?&quot;

Vampirella smiled slightly, barely revealing her fangs as she cooed, &quot;I 
don&#39;t eat... food.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Alpha blinked then cheerfully hurried off.

&quot;That girl&#39;s not quite normal,&quot; Vampirella frowned, surprised the girl 
was unaffected by her supernatural powers.

&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone in this bar is exactly normal,&quot; Jane pointed out 
dryly.

Vampirella chuckled softly, &quot;Good point.&quot; She studied Jane thoughtfully, 
&quot;I remember when I was hurt....&quot;

&quot;I offered you my blood,&quot; Jane nodded slightly.

&quot;It was delicious,&quot; Vampirella leaned forward to rest her hand on Jane&#39;s 
arm, &quot;and I&#39;ve always wanted to repay you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t really need....,&quot; Jane blushed.

Vampirella smiled and gave her a saucy wink, &quot;Please, I think I can come 
up with something to do for you.&quot;

Jane blushed as Alpha delivered the food, &quot;Let&#39;s talk about it.&quot;

Meanwhile, up at the bar Juri Arisugawa nodded as the orange haired 
woman talked to a teen, &quot;So you&#39;re not sure how you feel about her?&quot;

Cassie Hack nodded, her black hair falling around her face as she 
admitted, &quot;I like Georgia a lot, but....&quot;

&quot;Take it slow,&quot; Setsuna Meiou offered gently, &quot;you have time.&quot;

&quot;I fight undead serial killers for a hobby,&quot; Cassie said dryly, &quot;I dunno 
how much time I really have.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard of crazier hobbies,&quot; Juri admitted, remembering her year as 
a duelist.
