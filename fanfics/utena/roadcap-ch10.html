<a href="../utena/roadcap-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        Mikage jerked backwards, clutching his head in his hands as he 
slammed into a wall. He stumbled, dropping to the floor with a loud 
thump.

        &#39;That bitch,&#39; Mikage thought, his mind in turmoil, &#39;how did 
she...?&#39;

        Feedback from having a spell disrupted was agonizing to a magic 
user, even if one was prepared for it. Out on the battlefield a warmage 
would have defenses erected and a healer ready in case a spell was 
broken or worse, back-lashed on him. Mikage hadn&#39;t been expecting such 
resistance, hadn&#39;t prepared any such defense.

        &#39;I&#39;ll see them bleed for this,&#39; Mikage thought, a trickle of 
blood running from his nose. He curled up into a ball, groaning, lost to 
his misery.

        In another part of the great castle Nanami lead the way into the 
healer&#39;s ward, her long blonde hair falling down her back. &quot;Hitomi!&quot; she 
cried fiercely.

        The brown haired healer looked up in alarm. &quot;Has the 
Princess...?&quot; Hitomi asked them worriedly, rising from where she tended 
a sleeping patient.

        &quot;No,&quot; Keiko shook her head, her brown braid bouncing. &quot;But 
Utena&#39;s been hurt, fairly badly,&quot; she said gravely.

        Hitomi&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said to them seriously, 
grabbing her bag of medical supplies and swiftly slinging it over her 
shoulder. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked crisply as they hurried down the 
castle hallways.

        &quot;Mikage attempted to attack Shiori before she could try to track 
him,&quot; Nanami said to her crisply, &quot;and Utena intervened. She somehow 
called the Sword of Dios to her to drive him off, but it was still hot 
from the re- forging.&quot;

        &quot;Goddess,&quot; Hitomi muttered and quickened her pace.

        The three of them burst into the Princess&#39; rooms, gazing at the 
figures within. Miki Kaoru lay unconscious to one side, while three 
figured gathered worriedly around a fallen figure. Anthy looked up as 
they entered and smiled in relief, &quot;You&#39;re here at last.&quot;

        Hitomi silently made her way to Utena&#39;s side, the others moving 
aside as she knelt down. The scent of burned flesh lingered there, the 
healer carefully examining both of Utena&#39;s injured hands. &quot;I think I can 
help,&quot; she said firmly.

        Anthy&#39;s eyes glittered with her unshed tears, short purple hair 
falling into her face as she softly said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        Juri watched intently as Hitomi cupped Utena&#39;s hands in her own, 
chanting softly as a gentle glow surrounded her hands. The orange haired 
woman shook her head as she said, &quot;I hope that she knows what she&#39;s 
doing.&quot;

        Shiori was firm, &quot;Hitomi was the best, back in our mercenary 
days.&quot; The violet haired woman smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ve seen her deal with 
much worse.&quot;

        &quot;I hope so,&quot; Juri frowned.

        Nanami watched a moment, then walked over to where the plain, 
unmarked sword had fallen to the floor. She reached out carefully, but 
it was cool to the touch. Cautiously she picked it up and carried it 
over to where Utena lay.

        Utena groaned softly, then there was a fluttering behind her 
eyelids. Suddenly her eyes shot open as she sat up suddenly, &quot;Anthy!&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; Anthy quickly said, clasping Utena close to 
her.

        &quot;I thought..., &quot; Utena held her, then hissed in pain, jerking 
her hands back.

        &quot;The flesh of your hands is still very tender,&quot; Hitomi scolded 
fiercely, &quot;it will take several days for you to fully recover.&quot; A bit 
more gently she said, &quot;You&#39;d be best advised to wear gloves for the next 
few days and take it easy.&quot; She paused, &quot;Not that I think you will.&quot;

        &quot;Go help Miki,&quot; Utena ordered Hitomi crisply, then looked 
around, &quot;Shiori?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Shiori said as Anthy helped Utena to rise to her feet.

        &quot;Do you know where Mikage is?&quot; Utena demanded, leaning on Anthy 
for support. It almost looked like the warrior&#39;s legs were going to 
collapse right under her, but she remained standing as if by the force 
of her will alone.

        &quot;I can find him,&quot; Shiori quietly agreed, &quot;I had nearly done so 
earlier when he sent his astral form to interfere.&quot;

        Juri&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;You cant be planning to...?&quot;

        &quot;We need to go after him now,&quot; Utena said, steadying her wobbly 
legs. She shook her head a few times to clear it, flexing her aching 
fingers as she continued, &quot;He knows we&#39;re on to him, if we don&#39;t go for 
him now he&#39;ll flee.&quot;

        &quot;Or he&#39;ll prepare a devastating final assault to attempt to 
achieve his goals,&quot; Nanami offered grimly. &quot;We must act.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve got a little time,&quot; Shiori noted, &quot;the backlash of the 
banishment of his astral form will have left him weakened. But not for 
too long.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re in no shape to try this, Utena,&quot; Hitomi muttered as she 
directed several of the castle servants in taking the unconscious Miki 
out of the room. &quot;Shiori, talk some sense into them,&quot; she appealed to 
the dark haired sorceress.

        &quot;You know Utena just as well as I do,&quot; Shiori was smiling 
slightly as she looked over at Utena, &quot;when she gets like this there&#39;s 
no talking to her.&quot; Then she shrugged at Hitomi before adding, &quot;Besides, 
I think she&#39;s right.&quot;

        &quot;Fools,&quot; Hitomi muttered, taking the injured Miki away.

        Utena took the Sword of Dios from Nanami, wincing slightly as 
her fingers closed around the hilt. Anthy caught that pained expression 
and sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll get you some gloves.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena smiled as she slipped the while gloves on, 
wrapping her fingers around the sword more comfortably.

        &quot;I&#39;m going with you all, of course,&quot; Anthy said calmly.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Utena agreed.

        &quot;What?!&quot; Nanami blurted.

        Anthy gave her a smile as she explained, &quot;Utena can do one of 
two things. She can split her forces to both guard me and attack Mikage, 
which lessens her chances to succeed at either mission, or she can bring 
me along.&quot;

        &quot;About what I figured,&quot; Juri agreed.

        Utena looked over the group of determined young women around 
her. &quot;I won&#39;t command any of you to go with me, however,&quot; she said, &quot;I 
have no idea what we&#39;re going to be facing or the risks we may be 
taking.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m going,&quot; Shiori said simply, &quot;I want a shot at Mikage.&quot;

        &quot;Where she goes, I go,&quot; Juri kept her answer short and to the 
point.

        Nanami looked at Utena thoughtfully, then looked over to where 
Anthy had taken her captain&#39;s hand. &quot;I&#39;m going,&quot; she smiled, &quot;my honor 
demands nothing less.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t really care about my honor,&quot; Keiko said quietly, &quot;but 
you&#39;re all my friends.&quot; She looked over at Nanami and blushed faintly, 
&quot;Or more than friends, and I will not let you face this danger alone. 
I&#39;m in.&quot;

        &quot;Looks like we&#39;re decided,&quot; Utena said. She flashed a sudden 
smile, &quot;Not that I didn&#39;t think you weren&#39;t all coming.&quot;

        &quot;Then why did you ask?&quot; Keiko blinked.

        &quot;Thought I should give you the option,&quot; Utena shrugged. She 
nodded to Shiori, &quot;It looks like it&#39;s time to go.&quot;

        Shiori closed her eyes and began to chant, cupping her hands in 
front of her as the power rose up around her. Her hair was stirred by an 
unfelt breeze, the mage robes that she wore swirling around her legs. 
Shiori&#39;s eyes snapped open, glowing golden as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

        Shiori strode out the door, the others following behind her...</pre>
