<h1>Akio's Revenge (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ggunsailor.html">Ggunsailor</a><br> </h2>

year of college, and Touga, Juri, Miki, Saionji, Ukoji, and Anthy are in 
their junior year.

Enjoy!

There are spoilers for those who haven&#39;t read the manga. Sorry!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Then, you&#39;ll be here...forever? You&#39;re always going to stay by my 
side?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t leave this time, will you?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to be together.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t ever leave me alone?&quot;

&quot;No...never again.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;ll always be like this?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I swear...I&#39;ll love you...until the world ends!&quot;

&quot;Me, too...I...I love you so much, Utena! Please...Hold me...until the 
end of time...&quot;

&quot;Always, Anthy. Always.&quot;

&quot;I love you...my prince...&quot;

&quot;I love you...my princess...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a little teaser for ya. On with the show!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Anthy, wait!&quot;

Anthy Himemiya turned at the remark. She had to smile at the sight of 
Ukoji huffing and puffing as he tried to catch up. When he did, he 
stooped over to catch his breath.

Between breaths, he said sarcastically &quot;You know (huff), if you really 
(huff) insist on (huff) going faster (huff) than me, maybe I should 
(huff) stop going on these (huff) morning runs with you. Phew!&quot;

She grinned at him and teased &quot;Well, maybe you need to stay in shape a 
bit more? Stop eating sweets so much?&quot;

Ukoji glared at the former Rose Bride who, at the moment, didn&#39;t look 
like a bride in track shorts, running shoes, and an old t-shirt of his 
that said &quot;BANZAI!&quot; in red letters. He himself didn&#39;t look like a 
student of the prestigious Ohtori Academy in an American football team 
jersey and track pants.

&quot;Humph! I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;m in top physical condition.&quot; He laughed. 
&quot;At least I&#39;m not chubby like ChuChu is!&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot; The monkey-like creature popped his head over Anthy&#39;s shoulder 
and &quot;Chu-ed&quot; indignantly.

Ukoji chuckled and bowed. &quot;Oh, a thousand pardons, O wise &amp; honorable 
ChuChu, I forgot you were here.&quot; Anthy laughed and patted her little 
friend on the head.

As they walked back to the Academy gates, Ukoji observed &quot;Well, I 
remember whenever Utena and I went running; you didn&#39;t really want to 
come. Why the sudden interest in it now?&quot;

When she looked down at her feet and blushed, he grinned and said &quot;Okay, 
I won&#39;t ask, but I&#39;m guessing it has to do with her?&quot;

Anthy sighed. It was true: she&#39;d fallen in love with the one and only 
Utena Tenjou.

And why, you ask? She had fallen in love with her nobility, her 
valiance, her courage, and her passion for life. There was also her 
wisdom and intelligence, and her grace.

She closed her eyes and remembered Utena&#39;s blue eyes flashing with the 
light of battle as she dueled, wielding the Sword of Dios as if it had 
been made for her. She sighed. &quot;Guess I&#39;m a lost case, huh?&quot;

ChuChu said &quot;Chu...&quot; mournfully as he lamented his mistress&#39;s plight.

As they walked through the gates, Ukoji asked &quot;So, figured out what that 
dream of yours means?&quot;

&quot;No, not yet.&quot;

&quot;Well, have you told anyone else except me? Any of the other Council 
members?&quot;

Anthy looked at him aghast. &quot;Are you insane? They&#39;ll think I&#39;m nuts!&quot;

&quot;Did you even tell Touga? He might not think so.&quot; Silence.

&quot;You did?&quot; Anthy nodded.

Ukoji took a deep breath and let it out. Well, that was a good thing. At 
least Touga would understand. After what...happened, he was a lot more 
open then he was before. &quot;So, what&#39;d he say?&quot;

&quot;He said it was probably something that Akio-&quot; she shuddered slightly 
&quot;-Akio had left in my subconscious. But he did suggest that it might be 
a...prophecy.&quot;

&quot;A prophecy? What d&#39;you mean by that?&quot;

&#39;Oh, Ukoji doesn&#39;t know?&#39;

&quot;I should tell you, I guess. I....dreamed about Utena coming here. I 
dreamt that she would win the duel with Saionji. And I dreamt that she 
was the one to-&quot;

&quot;Revolutionize the world.&quot; Ukoji finished. &quot;So, you think it might be a 
prophecy?&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot;

As they walked across the campus, various students called out greetings. 
Ukoji stopped and talked with some members of the other clubs he was in.

Anthy stood quietly aside. Some students acknowledged her, asked her how 
she was, and she answered. But for the most part she kept silent; which 
was odd, because she had become very popular now, and was well-admired 
by her fellow schoolmates.

Ukoji turned back to her and was about to say something when a sudden 
blur of deep red hair jumped on his back.

He staggered forward and almost fell, but he kept his balance and yelled 
&quot;WAKABA!&quot;

The girl grinned at him and said &quot;Surprised to see me? I&#39;ve got some 
news to tell you!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well why don&#39;t you tell us when you get...off!&quot;

He dumped her off gently onto the grass and straightened up. &quot;Now I see 
why Utena complained so much; you&#39;re heavy! What&#39;s so important that you 
had to jump on me for?&quot;

He whirled around at Anthy who was giggling helplessly. &quot;And stop 
laughing Anthy!&quot;

&quot;Well, you two have a visitor who&#39;s waiting for you?&quot;

Both Anthy and Ukoji stiffened. &quot;A-a visitor?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Yep. They&#39;re waiting at your dorm, since you&#39;re the only ones with a 
key.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When they got to the hall, the door was unlocked. Their visitor had 
apparently found where they kept the extra key. Anthy could feel her 
heart pounding like mad as Ukoji told her to get behind him as they 
walked cautiously to their dorm. That door was unlocked as well.

Both very slowly went into the living room. They saw the silhouette of 
someone standing at the window, someone with long hair.

Ukoji pushed back his fear that welled in his stomach and said &quot;Who&#39;s 
there? How did you find our spare key? I warn you, I&#39;m armed and 
dangerous!&quot;

To prove his point he grabbed a tennis racket.

A voice both hadn&#39;t heard in two years answered &quot;If you call waving a 
racket &#39;armed and dangerous&#39;, I must be crazy. And the key was in the 
normal place: under the door mat.&quot;

&#39;No. It couldn&#39;t be...&#39; Anthy thought.

The person turned to face them, and the racket dropped from Ukoji&#39;s 
grasp as both gasped in surprise.

Utena Tenjou smiled and said softly &quot;Hi, guys.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, like the story so far? Don&#39;t worry, Wakaba fans, you will see more 
of her in this story!</pre>
