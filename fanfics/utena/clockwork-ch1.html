<h1>Just Like Clockwork (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Guardian 


It was now night time, the azure sky having bled away to a purple hued 
velvet that was impregnated with stars. The moon was a glowing sickle 
hanging from above, and the dark woods surrounding the young woman were 
strangely silent. It was a perfectly gorgeous night...too bad she 
couldn&#39;t concentrate on it. Across from the cinnamon skinned Anthy, the 
hulking robotic figure sat immobile on a log. Every now and then a small 
beam of twin blue lights would scan across the terrain, catching 
startled rabbits and owls. The fire crackled and popped loudly in the 
awkward silence as Anthy&#39;s brow twitched. Yes...there wouldn&#39;t be any 
enjoyment of stars this night.

The silence was extremely awkward for the young woman, although she 
usually wasn&#39;t one for chit chat most of the time. Her duties at the 
castle, and attending her brother...didn&#39;t often allot her a chance to 
interact socially. But this loud silence was only broken now and then by 
the clicking clank of the Guardian&#39;s armor. Eerie...very eerie.

Only hours earlier, the magical clockwork knight had escorted her down 
the mountain trails, quickly finishing off the General&#39;s men with a 
practiced ease. The Guardian, upon her request, merely stunned them and 
took their weapons, tossing them far off the edge of the cliff. The rest 
of the men had turned and fled, leaving their defeated green-haired 
leader behind, and freeing up the road for Anthy to leave. It then went 
about the process of investigating her wounded feet and hands, checking 
that the cuts were not too deep, and bandaging them as best it could for 
the time being. Anthy had sat through the examination silently and 
calmly, like a shock victim. Once through, the Guardian had then 
followed behind her as she hesitantly began leading them back towards 
the castle she had come from, intending to return with her new 
protector. But after only an hour&#39;s walking time, the metal creature had 
called a halt, declaring hollowly that travel at night in these lands 
was not wise

Now, in the small camp they had made, Anthy could no longer bear the 
silence that stretched between them. So with a polite smile and a warm 
voice she spoke, &quot;Ah...If it isn&#39;t too rude a question...just what 
exactly...are you?&quot; She hastened to elaborate, so as not to offend her 
new protector. &quot;What I mean is...there is an enchantment about you, 
something that&#39;s somewhat familiar to what I&#39;ve worked with and studied. 
But...you are also...something else.&quot; She screwed up her brow as she 
thought, feeling that sightless helm turn to look directly at her. &quot;Like 
a...doll...or maybe some sort of construct. I&#39;ve never seen metal move 
like you do.&quot;

For a while there was no reply, but then the hulking metal figure sat up 
a little straighter and replied in that low hollow ringing voice.

&quot;I am...a result of bio engineering and cybernetics. Unlike most robots, 
I am what is called a cyborg, human and technology melded into one being 
with the human core and brain functions still left intact.&quot;

Anthy stared at the thing in bewilderment. Roh...bawt? Sai...borg? What 
were these strange words? It sounded like something a bard or a story 
teller might make up. She couldn&#39;t even loosely recall this sort of 
language being mentioned in the Guardian legends themselves...and she 
had devoted a great deal of her time studying them.

Seeing Anthy&#39;s reaction, the thing gave a creaking sound as it leaned 
back on the log. &quot;...Hmm...I don&#39;t suppose ...&quot; Anthy looked up in 
interest. Her newly resurrected protector...it looked like it was 
hesitating over something. Keenly she leaned forward.

&quot;...Would you happen to know how long I was put into hibernation? There 
was no equipment or monitors in the cavern. I suppose it&#39;s 
been...50...perhaps a 100 years?&quot;

Anthy looked at the tall knight and cocked her head to the side. She 
looked demure sitting there, almost elegant despite her tattered dirty 
dress, and bloody soiled body. With as much polite gentleness as she 
could, she broke the news.

&quot; My lord Guardian...the scrolls that I have studied...the ones I used 
to find you and learn about you...they give the legend that you&#39;ve been 
in a magic sleep for nearly two thousand years...&quot;

The hunk of metal sitting there said nothing to that, absorbing this new 
piece of information. Then it stood and began to walk into the wood. 
Worriedly, Anthy stood and called out, &quot;W-wait! Where are you going!&quot;

The suit of armor turned, it&#39;s alien glowing eyes locking onto her form. 
&quot;...you do not have any provisions with you. And based on my estimates, 
you haven&#39;t eaten for at least 6 hours, probably more. I&#39;m going to hunt 
some game and create your sleeping arrangements.&quot;

Anthy blinked in surprise at this, taken aback by the Guardian&#39;s 
observations. Yes she hadn&#39;t eaten but... Was it her imagination, or did 
the walking relic seem to carry a note of gentleness in it&#39;s voice? 
Anthy found herself relaxing a bit more, as it disappeared into the 
woods, quickly returning with three skinned rabbits, and much to her 
shock: a bed roll.

&quot;I located one of the enemy&#39;s horses caught in the thicket. It still had 
most of the soldier&#39;s things tied to the saddle.&quot; It explained, as it 
handed the thickly rolled material to her.

As the dusky woman&#39;s fingers brushed over those gauntleted hands, she 
looked up into that shadowed face mask. Only the faintest blue light 
seemed to be shining there...so strange and alien, yet somehow 
intriguing to look at as well. Like witch&#39;s fire...or the pixie lights 
in the more mythically inhabited sections of the kingdom. 
Enchanting...and so lifeless. She took the roll, and looked away. &quot;Thank 
you.&quot;

With a clicking clank, it moved away back towards the log but did not 
sit down. Instead it placed it&#39;s hand upon the sword hilt it wore around 
it&#39;s waist. &quot;Think nothing of it, my Princess. While you sleep I shall 
stand guard...and in the morning we shall continue to head for your 
castle.&quot;

The green eyed woman slipped down into the sleeping roll, but paused as 
she spoke. &quot;You call me a Princess, but I am not. I am merely a witch 
in...service to the king.&quot;

The Guardian answered without turning. &quot;You are indeed a Princess...one 
of Dio&#39;s blood...otherwise you would not have been able to summon me 
from my hibernation program.&quot;

The woman shook her head firmly, tossing her tangled deep violet curls 
as she did so. &quot;No...my brother is king only because of his marriage to 
the old king&#39;s daughter, and that was how he gained his title. But I am 
not considered to be in line for the Ohtori throne in any way...Kanae is 
next as Queen, and any child they conceive will take her place.&quot; The 
woman&#39;s tone became hollow from long buried emotions.

&quot;I am a slave to his majesty...I serve him as a petty spell caster and 
a...a...an outlet for his...needs. I am not even considered a court 
magician or enchantress. He has others to fill that capacity. That&#39;s 
why, as a filthy slave who is passed around the castle...it isn&#39;t right 
or proper for you to address me as &#39;Princess&#39;.&quot;

Her tone was tinged with bitterness, as she fought to keep her face 
carefully blank and neutral. Her lot in life was set in stone...but with 
the Guardian&#39;s help she had been hoping to bring peace to the gradually 
degrading kingdom. The old texts and diagrams described a holy knight 
who would be awakened, and would then go on to drive out the Darkness. 
And while the holy being standing there in the shadows may be protecting 
her now, seeing to her needs...that would surely change once they were 
within Ohtori lands again. She was just...a courier...a guide for the 
being. That was all.

The Guardian startled her out of her depressing thoughts by snorting. 
Looking up from where she lay, Anthy crinkled her forehead in confusion.

&quot;Hmph...I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve been treated as you have, but the 
program is quite clear. Only a Princess could awaken me...and it would 
have to be one who held the blood of Dios in her veins. I&#39;m awake...and 
you are the one who awoke me. I think this makes things quite clear, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

Did it...did the Guardian just make a...joke? Anthy could only gaze on 
in bewilderment. &quot;But I-&quot;

It turned to her and held up one gloved hand. &quot;No...despite what this 
world has become...and despite what you may have been brought to 
believe, it isn&#39;t lineage or status that makes a princess...instead, 
there are certain qualities only a true one could possess. You are a 
Princess...even if others refuse to recognize you as such. What they 
believe does not matter. Your heart and inner royalty will be what puts 
those fools at your palace to shame, and unmasks the pretenders.&quot;

Anthy felt her heart skip a beat suddenly, though she couldn&#39;t quite 
figure out why. &quot;Why are you...saying these things?&quot; 

Aren&#39;t you supposed to worry about the kingdom? Save us from the 
darkness that is choking us? She asked mentally, unable to voice her 
concern. She couldn&#39;t mistake the utter confidence and sincerity in that 
hollowly ringing voice this time.

&quot;Because I am your Guardian.&quot;

Her questions died in her throat, as her heart beat even faster. The 
knight stood and moved away from the firelight to blend in with the 
shadows. &quot;I will stand guard. Sleep for now, my Princess. At first light 
I will wake you and we will make preparations to move out.&quot; It then fell 
quiet, and Anthy turned to put her back to the thing. As the sounds of 
hooting owls and crickets cautiously filled the night air with their 
song, and the haze of exhaustion began to steal over her, the dusky 
skinned woman began to think for the first time...just what could be 
lying hidden underneath the armor of the Guardian. The aching of her 
wounds faded, and she fell into a dreamless sleep.

When light first began to filter through the leaves of the trees, The 
robotic knight clanked to life and began moving toward the sleeping 
girl. Carefully it knelt, and reached out one gloved hand to lightly 
shake her by the shoulder.

&quot;My lady-&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes immediately flew open, and her hands swatted away the 
knight&#39;s own as if she had been burnt. But as she came to be aware of 
her surroundings, the tension in her shoulders melted away, and her arms 
came slowly down from their defensive position.

&quot;O-oh...it&#39;s just you...&quot; The knight answered her in its low hollow 
voice.

&quot;My lady, we should have you break your fast. Then we&#39;ll need to get 
what things we have together, to leave. I have the horse from yesterday 
hobbled and ready to carry you.&quot;

Anthy stifled a yawn behind her hand politely and blinked more alertly. 
&quot;Alright, I understand.&quot; She moved to roll up her bed roll and then 
began helping to clean up the camp. Once through, tugging down the 
tattered remains of her dress in a sudden feeling of self consciousness, 
the emerald eyed woman sat down on the log to begin eating the cold 
remains of the rabbit from the night before. The Guardian was standing 
off a ways, patient and strong. Tucking snarled strands of dark violet 
hair behind her ears, she snuck a glance over at the magic suit of 
armor...and began to wonder once more...was it simply a suit of magic 
armor brought to life? Or was there a man inside...she found that 
thought strangely exciting. What would he look like? Would he even be 
human? The witch wondered if there would ever come a time when she would 
be able to find out. It was as these thoughts were passing through her 
mind as she continued staring, that she happened to look down at her bed 
roll. She&#39;d been so distracted, she&#39;d been chewing on the same small 
bone for quite some time. Throwing the remains into the fire, she washed 
her hands and took a drink from the water skin the Guardian provided 
her.

&quot;Are we ready then? Come, I&#39;ll assist you. Have you ridden a horse 
before?&quot; Anthy gave a nod, &quot;Yes...when I was younger.&quot; She paused beside 
the saddle as the large knight moved over and suddenly grasped her 
carefully about the waist. Hefting her easily with inhuman strength, she 
was set upon the saddle, and the Guardian grasped the reins to hand to 
her.

&quot;I shall keep pace alongside.&quot; Was the reply to her unspoken question. 
And keep pace it did, as Anthy brought her horse into a canter, the 
clockwork construct kept along side her easily with so much as a hint of 
weariness. She increased the speed a bit gradually, watching the figure 
out of the corner of her eye. But it never slowed. And so the two raced 
alongside each other, out of the forest and out onto the open 
countryside. The lands of Ohtori...the outskirts of the castle 
providence.

An hour or so had passed, the two making excellent time through the 
fields of tall grass and the swell of hills, when suddenly the town that 
fringed the large castle walls loomed into view. The knight motioned for 
them to slow, so that they could speak. The horse brought to a walk, 
Anthy twisted in the saddle. &quot;What is it? Castle Ohtori is just ahead. 
We should continue on.&quot;

The knight considered a moment and then shook its head. &quot;...Actually, I 
think this would be a good opportunity to present you as my new Charge.&quot;

Anthy raised an eyebrow, resembling her brother Akio for a moment. &quot;What 
do you mean, &#39;present me&#39;.&quot;

The knight answered, &quot;...my program dictates that when a Princess of 
Dios awakens me from my sleep, I am to assist her and act in her stead 
and insure the purity and prosperity of her realm. But first...I need to 
assess the current situation.&quot; The white armored knight stated 
matter-of-factly. &quot;And in order to do so unhindered, we shall present 
you as one of royalty, with my own personal backing. The guards and 
servants at the castle will see to it we are gained admittance to have 
an audience with the king...and from there I can glean necessary 
information. As well as resolve your current...dilemma.&quot;

The knight turned to her, it&#39;s twin blue lighted eyes seeming to see 
straight into soul, and it&#39;s face plate making it&#39;s expression 
unreadable. &quot;You...are a slave no longer. I will see to it that you are 
not treated as such again.&quot; Anthy&#39;s heart began beating wildly. Could 
the Guardian really mean such a thing? How had everything in her life 
suddenly changed so drastically? Then her blood turned to ice. The 
knight intended to present her to the king...her brother...what would he 
do to her for her impudence? What would happen to them both, if he...

Her thoughts were cut short as the knight gave a short bow to her. &quot;Now 
then...I think it, ah...best if we find a place to...get you cleaned up. 
I would not have you less than perfect for your return to the castle. 
But...I am unfamiliar with this town. Are there places where we can 
purchase fitting formal wear for a woman of your station?&quot;

Shaking her head to focus her thoughts, trying to absorb what she could, 
Anthy immediately situated on getting done what needed doing. A thing 
she had learned to do from a young age. &quot;Yes. There&#39;s a tailor&#39;s hall 
down two streets from here. There&#39;s also a small inn we can use to clean 
up from our travels.&quot; The knight handed her a large bag full of clinking 
coins, that it had kept somehow conceal on its person. &quot;Here...our 
soldier friend left us a present. While you go about securing a place to 
rest momentarily, I shall send for a dress to be made for you, and see 
about a doctor who can take care of your wounds.&quot;

Anthy shook her head, &quot;There aren&#39;t...many doctors around these days. 
They have all but died out. I think there&#39;s a healer woman who has a 
flower shop though. Thank you...for concerning yourself about my 
injuries...&quot; Privately, the emerald eyed girl felt shamed. She was a 
witch, and yet for all her dark dabblings and minor tricks...she wasn&#39;t 
even able to heal the cuts on her hand. Or repair the soles of her feet. 
She was pathetic...good only for the most unsavory of things. Typical.

The mechanical knight gave a nod, almost to itself. &quot;Very well. I shall 
meet you at the inn...&quot;

&quot;The Errant Rose&quot; Anthy supplied.

&quot;Yes, shortly. For now, please rest easy knowing you are under my care. 
Until my return.&quot; And the knight gave a regal bow. The two separated, 
and Anthy in her tattered clothes seemed to draw disdainful stares from 
every direction. It wasn&#39;t often she had been allowed to leave the 
castle...and seeing their poisonous looks, (from peasants no less! ) 
spoiled her enjoyment of the town. Upon reaching the two story wooden 
building, with its faded hand painted sign, Anthy moved I through the 
open doorway, pushing aside a long draping cloth. Within were low tables 
where patrons sat, eating and drinking comfortably. A matronly woman 
made her way over, a scowl on her face.

&quot;Now see &#39;ere! We don&#39;t be catering to filthy riff-raff. We&#39;re an 
upstanding establish-&quot;

He tirade was cut short as Anthy produced a few copper and silver coins. 
&quot;I&#39;m look for a room to rest in. And a bath, please.&quot; The weather beaten 
woman&#39;s eyes widened in shock, her entire demeanor suddenly changing as 
she eyed the coins in the filthy slender hand. More money than she would 
probably see in two month&#39;s time! Her voice took on an oily tone at 
once, as she bowed low.

&quot;Ah! My l-lady, please! Begin&#39; your pardon for me rudeness earlier...I 
will at once offer you our largest room...one with a lovely view 
o&#39;course! And a bath will immediately be drawn for you, with our 
compliments. Mari! Come &#39;ere lass, and set the lady up with the stately 
room upstairs!&quot;

A small thin girl dressed in a drab brown bodice and simple long skirt 
came over, and bowed even lower to Anthy. &quot;Please ma&#39;am...right this 
way...&quot; Leading Anthy, unused to being treated so courteously, upstairs, 
a couple of chamber maids began lugging up a large copper kettle up 
behind them. Unlocking the door to a spacious and well lit room, the 
little girl pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped aside to let 
Anthy and the two women inside. As Anthy marveled at the neat tidy oak 
bed, the low table and chair, the basin and mirror (A rarity) and the 
worn drapery that added a touch of color to the room, Mari bowed again.

&quot;The kitchen has a boar on the spit down below, so if ma&#39;am desires any 
meals to be brought to her, she has but to ask. We will send up anything 
she might require. Please enjoy.&quot;

The two serving women set up the oversized kettle, which the dark 
skinned woman was able to now tell was a portable bath, over in the 
center of the room. Then they began the laborious process of carrying 
steaming hot buckets of water up and down the steps to slowly fill the 
copper tub. Once it was full, and bringing up a woven basket of scented 
soaps, cloths to wash one&#39;s face with, and towels to dry off with, they 
departed. One of the maids had been thoughtful enough to leave a fresh 
white linen shift behind.

Gratefully, the girl wasted no time in shutting the door and ridding 
herself of her filthy clothing. Stepping into the hot water, she gave a 
gasp. Squeezing her eyes shut, she slowly got in, letting her aching 
muscles unknot and relax in the warmth, as the filth from two days of 
travel fell away from her. Using the soap to shampoo her hair and one of 
the cloths, Anthy scrubbed and scrapped along her naked body. Sighing in 
satisfaction in feeling clean in what felt like forever, there was a tap 
at the door. The girl Mari again. Calling for her to come inside, the 
little girl shut the door behind her and made her way over to the low 
table.

&quot;I thought ma&#39;am would like a comb perhaps, as she relieved herself from 
her travel wearies. I have also brought up a flask of chilled wine, 
courtesy of the kitchens.&quot;

Anthy thanked her, handing her a large copper coin, which she gratefully 
accepted and hid somewhere amongst her skirt pleats. Allowing herself to 
soak a moment longer, she finally got out with a sigh, and toweled 
herself dry. Gods but it felt good...

Pulling on the soft white linen shift, and moving to stand in front of 
the mirror, Anthy looked at her reflection. She was...a bit on the thin 
side. Her eyes still had bags under them, and her hair was snarled. 
There were bruises coating her skin from her battle up the mountain and 
with the Kyouichi general. But at least she wasn&#39;t a filthy pig anymore. 
A bath truly did wonders for the soul, though it was a far cry from the 
castle. But then...the only time she was allowed time in the big 
luxurious baths there was when...she had had to...entertain...

Her eyes dimmed to blankness as she picked up the comb. Smooth 
mechanical strokes brought it through her damp snarled hair. Within 
moments, her hair was flowing freely and neatly in soft waves down her 
shoulders, sweeping low on her hips. Much better. A polite knock at the 
door again startled her, and thinking it was Mari, she called again.

&quot;Come in. I&#39;m through with my bath.&quot;

But it wasn&#39;t Mari. It was the Guardian. Bowing gracefully, the shining 
white knight, surely having turned many heads down in the streets of the 
castle town, stepped through the doorway, with two people in tow. One 
was a dour faced woman in spectacles, the other was a young blonde 
haired boy who was looking about him in interest. The knight dropped to 
one knee.

&quot;My lady, I&#39;ve brought the healer and the tailor. Shall we see about 
getting you something to where to the palace?&quot; Lifting it&#39;s visor to 
look at her fully, the knight suddenly hesitated. It seemed to gaze at 
her a few moments, then start up again hurriedly as Anthy set down her 
comb.

&quot;Ah, anyway. I&#39;ve returned to insure your protection, so I shall stand 
by the door while you are seen to. Madam Haruna, will you please look to 
the Princess&#39; injuries?&quot;

The woman sniffed haughtily. &quot;Hmph...Princess indeed...yes yes, I will 
do so Sir Knight. Come then child, let me see your hands.&quot; Bristling 
inwardly at having this pudgy faced woman call her a &#39;child&#39;, but 
keeping her face a polite mask, Anthy did so. The woman bent over her, 
prodding the flesh surrounding with an expert eye. Nodding to herself, 
she set to whispering incantations as she smeared on various powders and 
herbs across the wounds, and moved to see to her feet. Feeling flesh 
knit together, and dull aches cease, the former slave of the castle 
looked on as her flesh returned to a healthy color. Once she was done 
the dour healer left, having already collected her fee. Anthy wiggled 
her finger experimentally, gazing at whole unbroken skin. The boy 
stepped forward next, a cheerful smile.

&quot;Now then, my lady! With your permission, I should like to take your 
measurements. Ah, now aren&#39;t you absolutely lovely! Yes yes...I have 
just the dress in mind. Please lift your arm.&quot; He took a marked piece of 
rope from her vest pocket, and begun taking her measurements, scratching 
notations out on a piece of parchment he had rolled in his other pocket. 
After a few moments, he was through bowing again. His smile made a small 
one of Anthy&#39;s come forth. His good cheer quite infectious. The young 
man seemed rather capable for someone his age.

&quot;Ah yes...I shall take these down to my master&#39;s shop and we&#39;ll alter 
one of our regal formal gowns for your use. If you should need any 
adjustments made before we deliver it here or have any complaints, 
please send for me! My name is Tsuwabuki...and my master&#39;s dresses are 
the best of the land! I hope you will find the fabric to your 
satisfaction!&quot;

With a jaunty bow and a wave, he was out the door. The energetic lad was 
heard taking the steps two at a time, no doubt eager to present his 
master the commission.

A somewhat bewildered Anthy now found herself alone with the silent 
knight standing to one side of the door. It&#39;s back turned to her. 
Hesitatingly, she moved to sit down on the edge of the bed, not knowing 
what to do or say in the silence. She was here alone with the knight, in 
only a shift. Awkwardness began to set in. Hunting about for something 
to engage the being in, Her emerald eyes caught onto a fine layering of 
dust and grime on the armor. Moving closer, she saw that it had indeed 
seen some wear...no doubt from their race here this morning. Using this 
as an excuse to speak with the knight, Anthy approached the white and 
silver construct.

&quot;My lord Guardian...I imagine the gown will take some time. Would you 
perhaps like to take a bath as well? Have your armor cleaned? I can send 
for the maids again and have the bath redrawn. Surely you yourself, my 
lord, would enjoy ridding yourself of the road. I can step outside and 
wait downstairs if you require privacy...&quot;

The knight turned to look at her.

&quot;No no my princess, I am fine. I would not like to inconvenience you. I 
shall wait a time.&quot;

Feeling a bit more determined, Anthy pressed. &quot;But surely you would at 
least like to remove your helm for a bit, if possible? You have been 
protecting me for nearly a day now, and you haven&#39;t once removed it.&quot;

The knight suddenly took a step back. Strangely, it&#39;s normally smooth 
and even voice became a bit more anxious. &quot;No, I&#39;m quite fine my 
Princess. Please do not concern yourself&quot;

Anthy stepped forward after it, as it took another hasty step back out 
of her reach. Puzzled but with her mind set, she reached out to try and 
grasp the helm. &quot;Oh come now, you speak of wanting to present me, a 
lowly slave, as a Princess to the court. Surely one of legend like 
yourself would want to be in top shape for our audience. Why are you so 
shy of removing your helm?&quot; Her curiosity making her bold she reached 
out again, as the knight side stepped her.

&quot;Now really, I don&#39;t think-&quot;

&quot;But I do, now come-&quot;

The knight tripped back over the pulled out chair and fell backwards 
oddly. In a half kneeling position, off balance badly, the knight tried 
to move its head out of the way as Anthy suddenly darted forward and 
tugged at the helmet in one smooth motion. The helmet came off with a 
slight resistance, and a long tumble of pink curls draped out from 
underneath. Shocked, Anthy clutched the helmet as she gaze into a pair 
of glowing blue eyes.

&quot;A-ah...you&#39;re a...&quot;

The face that had been hidden beneath the mask was smooth and angular, 
skin a creamy paleness that matched well with the armor it bore. Cupid&#39;s 
bow lips set in an uncomfortable frown, the Guardian gave a sigh.

&quot;...a girl. Yes I know...please forgive me...&quot;
