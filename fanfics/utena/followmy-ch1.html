first time.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Relaxing on her bed, the bunk bed, Utena finally got a chance to 
reflect on the relationship between her and Anthy. *That&#39;s just it, 
there is no relationship. No physical one anyways. Man..I gotta put 
some spice into it, but how?* She sighed at the thought of the 
reaction Anthy would give her if she ever tried anything, the other 
girl would probably...Utena opened her eyes, what _would_ Anthy do?

 {Utena tried to get closer to Anthy on the bottom bunk but the other 
girl just scooted away until she saw the look in Utena&#39;s eyes, 
reminiscent of the look Saionji used to give but with a certain 
softness to it. *This must be what Miss Utena wants.* Anthy took hold 
of Utena and kissed her passionately, surprising yet pleasing the 
girl. They eventually broke the kiss and then Anthy asked, &quot;Was that 
satisfactory, Miss Utena?&quot; Utena= sweatdrop.}

 Chuchu&#39;s moving around on Anthy&#39;s bed awoke Utena out of her 
daydream, her head picked up and her eyes snapped open. She looked 
around the room and then the prince painfully smiled. *That sounds 
like something she would do, just try and do what I want her to 
do...I&#39;ve got it!* Utena shot up and hit the ceiling, muttering swear 
words at the pain. She jumped off the bed and struck a chivalric pose, 
pointing to the sky. &quot;I must use my princely powers of seduction!&quot;

 Utena turned to the bed to see Chuchu looking at her with unhidden 
pity, she hated to say it but...even she didn&#39;t have a clue when it 
came to &#39;that&#39; kind of stuff. *I bet Juri-san knows how to seduce 
young women, she&#39;s probably a pro!* That thought prevented her from 
busting out of the East Dormitories to find Juri, what if she 
_herself_ would be Juri&#39;s next victim? *Victim? That&#39;s silly! There  
_is_ a line between business and pleasure.* (Most of the time.)

 With herself in check, Utena took off on her journey of knowledge. 
(Heheh..) Anthy watched her quizzically from the front door, seeing 
Utena walk with fervor and with a look of determination on the girl&#39;s 
face.

 Utena was a bit hesitant as she walked into a near-dark large room of 
the academy, knowing that the captain of the fencing team was most 
likely lurking about somewhere. She stopped near a large window and 
looked around her. &quot;Juri-san?&quot; The taller, older teenager seemed to 
materialize from the shadows wearing her student council getup. From 
behind, Juri stood until Utena saw the girl&#39;s shadow. &quot;Eek!&quot; Utena 
squeaked and stepped back. Juri= sweatdrop.

 Juri put her hands on her hips and spoke in the way that made others 
feel inferior to her,&quot;_What_ do you want?&quot; Utena almost lost her 
composure but she gathered her courage to ask, &quot;I need help seducing 
Anthy.&quot; The other girl almost fell over at Utena&#39;s 
straightforwardness, Juri cleared her throat and said, &quot;You&#39;re right 
to the point, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s an emergency! We&#39;ve lost that lovin&#39; feelin&#39;!&quot; Utena jumped up 
and down, knowing that there was no feeling in the first place. Juri, 
not exactly caring, looked at Utena like she had lost it again. &quot;And, 
how does this concern me, pray tell?&quot; She had a guess, it didn&#39;t sound 
like something she would waste her time on. &quot;Teach me the art of love! 
I want Anthy to _want_ me.&quot;

 &quot;Seduction? I&#39;m sorry, Utena, but you aren&#39;t sophisticated enough for 
_that_. You couldn&#39;t seduce me even if you tried,&quot; Juri stated, 
flipping her hair in a manner of superiority. The other girl moved 
closer, Juri stepped back and Utena hurriedly exclaimed, &quot;Just 
kidding!&quot; Utena backed away with puppy dog eyes, &quot;Pretty please? 
I&#39;ll...pay you...somehow. Anthy and I just aren&#39;t as close as I&#39;d like 
us to be-&quot; Juri interrupted her with, &quot;Oh, you mean you two don&#39;t make 
crazy love until all hours of the night?&quot; Utena= //  // + sweatdrop.

 &quot;Now _that_ was to the point,&quot; Utena commented, still red but slowly 
returning to her original color. Juri sighed knowing that Utena would 
be stubborn and persistent as usual if she didn&#39;t get her way, Juri 
decided to cooperate. &quot;How _will_ you pay me? I see no value in _your_ 
money.&quot; No money huh? A favor then? &quot;I&#39;ll find a way.&quot; The two girls 
stayed silent for a moment until Juri tilted her head and inspected 
Utena. &quot;Okay, first, straighten up. Chin up, shoulders back, _chest_ 
thrust out!&quot; Utena almost fell over.

 &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I just be myself?&quot; Utena asked, looking like a soldier. 
Juri huffed, &quot;Where exactly has that gotten you so far? Touga? _Don&#39;t_ 
get me started...Just follow my instructions and you&#39;ll have Anthy 
melt like butter in your arms by tonight.&quot; Utena glanced away.

 {As Anthy and Utena embraced, the prince felt her bride go weak in 
the knees and hold onto her for support. Utena nuzzled her nose into 
Anthy&#39;s neck and whispered sweet nothings into the other girl&#39;s ears, 
causing the other girl to turn red (_if_ you could tell) and lose 
herself to Utena&#39;s will.}

 Juri tapped Utena on the shoulder and sighed, &quot;Now, I like a girl who 
holds herself straight. It shows you have a strong back.&quot; Utena 
nodded. &quot;What else?&quot; The other girl thought a moment for something 
else, &quot;Move around.&quot; Utena began walking around, Juri noted her 
movements and stopped her. &quot;You have no...style...move your hips a 
little when you walk, be agile like a cat...&quot; Utena rose an eyebrow, 
&quot;But wait, I don&#39;t want to be like a slut. I want to be like..a pimp.&quot; 
Juri stepped back, Utena corrected herself. &quot;No, not like that. I 
don&#39;t want to be all girly for Anthy, I want to be...like a prince.&quot;

 Juri cringed. Utena and her silly prince obsession, didn&#39;t she ever 
hear about when the prince was seduced by the evil sorceress? &quot;Heh..&quot; 
Juri almost laughed, thinking of making Utena hers. It couldn&#39;t 
happen...She watched Utena walk across the room and then back to her, 
gazing at the prince&#39;s magnificent, smaller figure. &quot;...&quot; Utena gave 
her a nervous smile. &quot;Will that work?&quot;

 Juri nodded and stepped closer to Utena, gazing into the girl&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;Do you know how to kiss?&quot; Utena= // //. Was Juri putting the moves on 
_her_? Was it working?! Over and over again, Juri had heard of Utena&#39;s 
first &#39;kiss&#39; from her prince but that was so long ago..and from the 
rumors, it wasn&#39;t a kiss on the lips either. *I wonder what it would 
be like...* Both girls thought the same.

 Utena slowly shook her head, remembering the question asked by Juri. 
Didn&#39;t she _love_ Anthy? Would she let Juri destroy that? &quot;Just follow 
my instructions...&quot; There seemed to be a slight change in Juri&#39;s 
voice, impossible to pinpoint. Something along the lines of a barely 
audible cry to be loved. Juri stepped forward again, inches next to 
Utena. &quot;First..establish eye contact.&quot; Utena= //  //. Was Juri going 
to use the two of them for a demonstration...? (No duh..)

 Juri looked down into Utena&#39;s sapphire eyes filled with emotion. 
&quot;Juri-san...?&quot; Utena weakly asked. Why did Juri make her feel that 
way? Was she _trying_ to? &quot;It&#39;s only for your lesson, Utena. Don&#39;t 
take it seriously.&quot; The words stung for some &#39;strange&#39; reason, Utena 
closed her eyes. Did she was to take it seriously? &quot;I said, establish 
eye contact,&quot; Juri repeated. *Silly girl...so easily 
manipulated...she&#39;s like dough in my hands..*

 Utena&#39;s eyes snapped open as Juri placed her hands around the girl&#39;s 
hips, not being able to wait anymore. *Let me taste your kiss..* She 
placed a hand on Utena&#39;s cheek, closed her eyes, and then moved in to 
kiss Utena. (What?!) Utena wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do, she stood 
helpless and weak. Juri broke the kiss and rose an eyebrow. &quot;You know, 
Utena, most kisses _are_ a two-person affair. Unless you don&#39;t plan to 
do this with Anthy, I suggest you kiss me.&quot; Oh well...

 Utena wrapped her arms around Juri, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what she 
was doing was right but _at_ _least_ she could get some experience. 
Juri and Utena met in a passionate kiss that took the younger girl&#39;s 
breath away, Utena _almost_ allowed it to go further than a kiss but 
it was then that she realized she was due back at the dormitory. They 
pulled apart and stood as their eyes slowly opened to meet each other, 
Juri smiled, &quot;You&#39;re a natural.&quot; With that said, the fencer turned a 
and disappeared back into the shadows. Utena= @-@.

 Utena then turned to the door and walked out with Juri still watching 
her. *We&#39;ll have to finish this sometime...*


 Utena arrived at the East Dormitories right on time, the sun was 
beginning to set and Anthy had dinner out. It was fettuccini alfredo. 
A silence settled over the two of them until Utena remembered why she 
went to Juri in the first place, Juri wasn&#39;t even all that helpful 
even if she almost managed to seduce her. She quietly decided to make 
her move that night, Utena would have to be inconspicuous in luring 
Anthy into her arms.

 After the dinner, Utena tried out her &#145;cat&#146; walk leaving the table, 
noting  Anthy&#146;s  eyes following her movements. Anthy= sweat drop. 
&quot;Miss Utena, is something wrong with your leg?&quot; Utena almost fell over 
and then walked to Anthy&#146;s seat, a little peeved. &quot;No, I&#146;m fine.&quot; With 
that said, Utena left to their room, adding, &quot;I&#146;ll be waiting for 
you.&quot;

 Anthy was left confusing in the dining room, still wanting to know 
where her prince had gone earlier that day. She then began to clean up 
after diner, her usual routine. It was a good thing that Utena didn&#146;t 
know that Anthy had gone to receive love advice from Miki, he didn&#146;t 
exactly help either since he had never kissed&#133;never been in a romantic 
relationship. Miki told her that their lace of physical activity was 
caused by Utena&#146;s belief that Anthy only did what Utena wanted her to 
do which stopped Utena from trying anything all together.

 {Miki and Anthy sat on a bench outside the academy. &quot;See, Miss Anthy, 
show her that you love her. If she still doesn&#146;t understand then, 
maybe you need to fine someone who loves you.&quot; He said the last part a 
little quieter. &quot;But, we&#146;re engaged, I have to stay with her,&quot; Anthy 
protested. Miki rolled his eyes, &quot;Are you going to let a silly 
engagement to stop you from receiving the love you deserve?&quot;}

 *Tonight is the night.* Anthy turned off the kitchen light and headed 
upstairs.

 ~she&#146;s only got one reason to live
this is your life
she&#146;s only got one message to give
give It tonight~

 Anthy opened their door and saw Utena, leaning against the bed, still 
wearing her boy&#146;s uniform. There would be no better time, Utena opened 
her eyes and whispered, &quot;Anthy..&quot; Was Utena also planning her own show 
of love? Anthy walked to the bed. &quot;Miss Utena, I&#133;&quot; Utena lifted 
Anthy&#146;s chin with a hand so both of their eyes met, sparkling azure 
with glistening green eyes. &quot;You what..?&quot; Their voices were whispers 
as both of them became entranced by the other. Anthy= //  //.

 Utena wrapped an arm around Anthy&#146;s middle and pulled her closer, 
their bodies against each other. Utena= //   //. Anthy could feel her 
own temperature rising, she wrapped her arms around Utena and rested 
her head on the girl&#146;s chest. &quot;I love you&#133;.&quot; Finally, Utena had heard 
those three words and it seemed as though Anthy said them under her 
own free will. It wasn&#146;t the words, it was the meaning, it was the way 
that they sounded coming from Anthy&#146;s mouth. Utena felt like she could 
die and all would be right in the world right then but Anthy kept her 
there.

 Anthy took her hands off Utena and brought them to her hair, letting 
the purple waves all down along her back.  Utena ran a hand through 
the lavender hair and then gently kissed Anthy, letting a barely 
audible moan escape as she deepened the kiss. It was like a small fire 
that grew as Anthy kissed back and pressed Utena against the bed. 
Later that night, it transformed into an inferno of love between two 
young women&#133;.
