<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 2 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Akio looked like he had a truly massive headache as he surveyed the 
group of powerful young women Anthy had gathered. And with what seemed 
like suspicious quickness to him. &#147;All right, and then what happened?&#148; 
he snapped at them irritably. &#147;After your group had that oh-so bright 
idea, of course.&#148; he continued with much sarcasm.

Lina Inverse flushed a bit a his tone, then continued &#147; Well, the 
spell linking the realities seemed to work, it should have allowed 
easy travel between the separate worlds, but then suddenly we all 
found ourselves here.&#148; Lina shrugged eloquently. Lina, Belldandy, Urd, 
Mara, Skuld, Washu, Ryoko, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Pluto, Rei Ayanami 
and Naga the White Serpent all stood around looking vaguely 
uncomfortable, like students called up before the teacher.

&#147;We&#146;re still trying to figure out what may have caused the spell to 
fail, and us all to come here...&#148; Lina trailed off as she saw Akio&#146;s 
very pained expression.

&#147;And how long will it take you to FIX this?&#148; he asked wearily, rubbing 
his forehead where his veins formed a throbbing &#145;x&#146;.

They looked at each other a moment, then gathered into a huddle and 
confered quietly. Turning back to Akio, Lina simply said &#147;We don&#146;t 
know.&#148;

Anthy handed Akio a couple of aspirin, which he gulped down dry. She 
stepped down and went over to the group, where they began to discuss 
the situation and how to go about starting to fix it, even as Akio 
went to go have a lay down.

We can be heroes...

The Five Power Rangers teleported in front of the fearsome creature, 
stopped and posed their mightiest. The monster gaze them a calm gaze, 
and fired once. Five sets of color coded boots flopped over, smoking.

&#147;Would anyone else like to fill their shoes?&#148; the monster growled 
softly. A few moments later, it&#146;s question was answered.

Sailor Moon tripped, fell on her butt and began to cry, very loudly. 
Sailor Mars growled &#147;You&#146;re embarrassing us.&#148; Sailor Mercury, Sailor 
Jupiter and Sailor Venus all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere.

&#147;But Mars, it&#146;s mean!&#148; Sailor Moon whined, pointing at the monster. 
All the scouts sighed. Sailor Saturn and Chibi-Moon had found their 
friends Sakura and Tomoyo in the crowd and were having an enjoyable 
conversation, pointedly ignoring the battle.

Utena was sitting and watching the show, when she felt a light tapping 
on her shoulder. &#147;Excuse me,&#148; the young woman asked in worried tones, 
&#147;would you say that thing over there is a devil?&#148;

Utena blinked at the oddly dressed young woman beside her. Why does 
she have a yin and yang symbol on her chest, she wondered. &#147;Ah, no, I 
think it&#146;s one of Sailor Moon&#146;s typically lame ass monsters.&#148;

&#147;Oh, good,&#148; Devil Hunter Yohko said happily, &#147;then it&#146;s not my 
problem!&#148; She plops down by Utena and produces a tub of popcorn out of 
thin air. &#147;Would you like some?&#148; she offered Utena cheerfully.

Suddenly, the light seemed to fade, and a ringing voice came from the 
sudden darkness. &#147;The shadow of evil threatens the delicate flower!&#148; 
the woman&#146;s voice declared. Sailor Moon and the Scouts looked around, 
then up to a nearby building, and a silhouetted female figure standing 
heroically there. &#147;But I will not let the flower fall!&#148; She leaps 
down, her sword shining in front of her. &#147;I, the masked maiden, 
Pollylina!&#148;

&#147;That speech was almost as bad as one of Tuxedo Mask&#146;s.&#148; Sailor Uranus 
said to Sailor Neptune. Neptune nodded, sweatdropping.

Yuna, in the nearby crowd, is bouncing up and down with joy. &#147;It&#146;s 
Pollylina! She&#146;s really, really here! She&#146;s so incredibly cool! Hey, 
Pollylina!&#148; she yells sweetly and waves, catching the masked figure&#146;s 
attention, &#147;it&#146;s me, Yuna, you&#146;re biggest fan!&#148;

Pollylina sweatdrops.

Before anyone can react, three armored figures dropped to the ground 
in front of them, posing expertly. The blue Knight Sabre pointed it&#146;s 
gun arm, the white readied it&#146;s arm-mounted blades, and the green 
extended long cutting cables. They wait a moment, as if they are 
expecting someone else.

&#147;Where&#146;s Sabre Pink?&#148; Sabre Blue finally asks in a resigned tone of 
voice, as if she&#146;s dreading the answer. They look around a moment, 
then up to where a pink armored figure has somehow managed to tangle 
itself up in a dangling banner.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry!&#148; Sabre Pink yells down kawaiily, struggling to free 
herself and only getting more tangled.

Sabre White managed to visibly sweatdrop, even in her armor. &#147;Green, 
go get her down.&#148;

Nearby, a figure dropped almost silently into the crowd from above 
and, generating a lot of reactions, began to quickly make her way to 
the front, and the monster. Juri, as soon as she spotted her, covered 
Miki&#146;s eyes with one hand. The costume did make sense, Juri mused as 
she stared at her, the mask did cover her face, the gloves prevented 
anyone from getting fingerprints, and the books looked comfortable. 
Not that anyone payed any atention, considering she wasn&#146;t wearing 
anything else.

Kekko Kamen looked around curiously, &#147;What&#146;s everybody staring at?&#148;

While the various heroes were distracted, the monster clearly realized 
it was badly outgunned, and exercised the better part of valor. It ran 
away, very fast.

&#147;After it!&#148; Sailor Mars yelled. A few moments later, all the heroes 
stampeeded off in hot persuit!

Back at the campus security office...

Lt. Lucrezia Noin gave a small smile as Sgt. Leona Ozaki and her ever 
present two catgirl escort walked on in. &#147;Hi,&#148; she said, waving to 
them casually, &#147;did you get the truant?&#148;

Leona smiles back and nods happily. &#147;He ran back to Ohtori so fast, it 
was absolutely beautiful.&#148; she said.

Natsumi and Miyuki in traffic patrol scowled and complained loudly &#147;I 
was hoping we could get him!&#148;

&#147;I still wanted to shoot him again.&#148; Anna sighed mournfully as she 
pouted cutely.

Noin sweatdropped a bit at that. Leona walked over and began to stroke 
the pretty catgirl&#146;s back, generating a soft purr and calming Anna 
down. Uni, not wanting to be left out, snuggled in to Leona for some 
stroking too.

It took a lot of effort for Noin not to chuckle at the sight of the 
short but cute brunette petting the two amazonian blond girls. &#147;So,&#148; 
Noin asked smiling widely, &#147;how&#146;s the housing situation going?&#148;

Leona blushed brightly at the touchy subject. &#147;Ah, well, with so few 
rooms available, we&#146;re all still sharing one dorm room.&#148; She looked up 
to see Noin&#146;s even broader grin. &#147;Hentai,&#148; Leona said in a half 
hearted way. Noin just laughed.

&#147;Doesn&#146;t that room only have one bed?&#148; Noin asked her innocently. 
Leona didn&#146;t answer, just blushed harder.

Major Motoko Kusanagi walked in, smiling in a very self satisfied way. 
Her uniform, while clean, looked a bit rumpled, as if it had been 
pulled off then put back on. &#147;What was that disturbance about?&#148; Noin 
asked her.

The Major shruged. &#147;Just club sign-ups.&#148; With a very relaxed, 
contented expression, she sat down at the office computer. &#147;It was a 
very...&#148; she smiled broadly, &#147;rewarding assignment.&#148;



Housing Situations...

Utena and Anthy both loudly sighed with relief as they made their 
weary way back to the East Dorm. With all the crazyness that had been 
going on today, Utena was looking forward to the peace and quiet of 
the nearly empty building.

As they were about to open the front door they were jostled aside by a 
younger, red haired girl who was carrying an odd baton. &#147;Get back 
here!&#148; she yelled, chasing a small, brightly glowing object into the 
dorm.

&#147;Excuse us!&#148; the dark haired girl following the redhead said, keeping 
her video camera trained on the other girl&#146;s every move as she went 
inside.

Utena waited a moment and then slowly and cautiously opened the front 
door. In the front enterance, the redhead yelled &#147;Shining Thing! 
Return to your power confined! Shining Card!&#148; and bopped the small, 
brightly glowing object with her baton. It glowed even brighter for a 
moment, and then transformed, falling into her hands as a small card.

&#147;That was a great capture, Sakura! And I got every moment of it all on 
tape.&#148; the dark haired girl said happily.

Sakura sweatdropped. &#147;That&#146;s good, Tomoyo.&#148; she said, and then she 
noticed the stares Utena and Anthy were giving them. &#147;Uhm, I think 
we&#146;ll go to our room now,&#148; Sakura said, grabbing Tomoyo&#146;s hand and 
quickly racing upstairs.

Following the two of them up at a more reasonable pace, Utena and 
Anthy quickly noticed that there were name plates on almost every 
room, and most occupied in pairs. One even had three names: Leona, 
Anna and Uni. &#147;Isn&#146;t there only a single bed in there?&#148; A frowning 
Utena questioned aloud.

There was a long line-up at the bathroom, and several people were 
seriously threatening Minako&#146;s life if she didn&#146;t vacate the room, 
pronto. Juri&#146;s new friends Haruka and Michiru wandered by holding 
hands and smiling at each other before retreating to their room.

&#147;Isn&#146;t that a single, too?&#148; Utena asked Anthy, even as a soft &#147;squeak- 
squeak&#148; noise could be heard from within. Utena blushed and moved on 
quickly, not even waiting for Anthy to answer. &#147;Never mind,&#148; Utena 
said quietly.

Asuka Langly stalked past them and down the hallway, saw the massive 
line-up for the bathroom, and loudly growled &#147;Baka!&#148; She quickly 
turned, and strode back down the hallway towards her room. Before she 
reached it, the door opened and a white haired girl stuck her head 
out, smiling at her.

&#147;Is there still a line up?&#148; Rei Ayanami asked mildly. Her red eyes 
took one look at Asuka&#146;s expression and she sighed softly. &#147;Of 
course.&#148;

Rei stepped out of the room and Utena gasped softly. Rei was wearing a 
skintight white and blue high-tech bodysuit that looked like it had 
been airbrushed onto her body. &#147;Come with me,&#148; she said shortly to 
Asuka. Drawing stares from everyone, she reached the bathroom line and 
took a supplicating pose, hands clasped in front of her. 
Coincidentally, or not, it pushed her breasts together and emphasized 
her cleavage.

&#147;My friend REALLY needs to use the bathroom,&#148; Rei said in kawaii 
tones, batting her eyes as she looked up at them. Makoto&#146;s eyes 
widened, Usagi and Ami blushed, and Rei Hino looked like she was 
enjoying the show. Usagi was quickly sent in to get Minako out, on 
condition that Rei Ayanami had to stay out there to keep them company.

Asuka used the bathroom as quickly as possible, and then all but 
dragged Rei Ayanami away from the growing crowd. &#147;I have never been so 
embarrassed!&#148; Asuka said, blushing.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Rei Ayanami said softly. She smiled sweetly up at Asuka. 
&#147;I guess you could always spank me for being bad,&#148; she said in sultry 
tones. Asuka blushed even brighter as she drew the broadly smiling Rei 
into their room. </pre>
