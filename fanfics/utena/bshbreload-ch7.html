<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 7 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bshbreload-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Anthy walked up the stairs, the abandoned dorm quiet around her. The 
dust lay thick, here, and the broken lights hung empty from the ceiling. 
If Utena really wanted to she could live some semblance of a normal 
life, using her powers to hide her presence but instead she chose to 
remain here. Privately Anthy suspected it was to protect others, to 
shield Utena from the temptation that other people represented.
 
She reached the upper floor room then Anthy waited patiently out in the 
dim hallway, calmly leaning up against the wall as she watched the sun 
slowly set outside the nearby window. The last of the light finally 
faded, and from inside the room she heard faint movement as the woman 
within stirred. Finally, Anthy heard a voice call out to her clearly, 
&#147;Come in, Anthy.&#148;
 
She pushed the door open, seeing Utena sitting on the edge of the bed. 
Strangely, there were no sheets or blankets, the mattress totally bare, 
and the old bed seemed to have a reddish stain right in the middle. She 
looked up, her robin&#39;s blue eyes seemingly haunted by something.
 
Anthy felt a pulse of desire at seeing the young woman&#39;s nudity and 
fought for control. Utena was so beautiful in the moonlight, her skin 
ivory white, the nipples just a bit rose, her muscled belly and that 
lightly haired pink mound. &#39;It&#39;s just the vampire mind gifts,&#39; she 
thought firmly, knowing that for her that was in part a lie.
 
&#147;You&#39;re here early tonight,&#148; Utena said to her softly as she got up from 
her bed, taking a damp cloth from a wash basin right beside her bed and 
then beginning to clean her naked body off. She moved so sensuously, her 
long, lean body turning in the dim light, and Anthy felt her breath 
catch in her throat as her heart beat faster.
 
Anthy opened her mouth to speak, surprised to find she couldn&#39;t. 
Clearing her throat Anthy managed to get out, &#147;Kiryuu Touga seems to 
have killed again.&#148;
 
Utena stiffened, carefully putting the cloth down for a moment. &#147;Damn 
it,&#148; she said softly, finishing with a snarled out, &#147;I should have got 
him when I had the chance!&#148; She strode over to her closet, her body 
still damp, and smoothly pulled out a school uniform. Pulling it on 
roughly, she demanded of Anthy, &#147;Do you know where he&#39;s been hiding?&#148;
 
&#147;I did some investigation in the daylight, it&#39;s the Observatory, I 
think,&#148; Anthy answered her softly, looking at the furious Utena rather 
warily. She reached into her pocket and grasped a stake in her hand, 
hoping that the bloodlust had not suddenly taken Utena over. Eve worse 
the power that Utena radiated seemed to crackle in the air, an 
electricity that made her want to kneel before this powerful woman 
and.... &#39;No,&#39; Anthy thought to herself firmly.
 
Utena saw the concern and fear in Anthy&#39;s eyes, and visibly worked to 
try and calm herself down a little. &#147;I&#39;m sorry to frighten you,&#148; Utena 
said to her softly, &#147;you see, I had a chance to finish him off earlier, 
but he managed to escape me.&#148; She sat a moment to lace up her shoes as 
she added, &quot;A mistake I won&#39;t make again.&quot;
 
&#147;I understand,&#148; Anthy said to her quietly in return, &#147;but don&#39;t let your 
fury get the best of you. You&#39;re better than that, I think.&#148;
 
Utena smiled back at her grimly, &#147;I&#39;ll try.&#148;
 
Reluctantly Anthy extended a piece of paper, knowing what it would 
probably do to Utena&#39;s temper. &#147;He left this with the body,&#148; Anthy said 
seriously.
 
&#147;Tenjou Utena,&#148; it read in an elegantly written script, &#147;Stop me if you 
can.&#148; And underneath it was signed simply, &#147;Kiryuu Touga.&#148; Utena read it 
through once, then again, the expression on her face strangely blank 
before she crumpled it in a flash of rage.
 
&#147;It was a young woman that was found?&#148; Utena asked her softly, 
struggling to keep her voice even. Anthy looked at her in surprise, so 
Utena asked the question once again, &#147;The body that was found, it was a 
young woman?&#148;
 
&#147;Yes,&#148; Anthy nodded, and asked her, &#147;how did you know?&#148;
 
&#147;It&#39;s just his style,&#148; Utena said coldly, letting the crumpled note drop 
to the floor. She walked over and looked out the window at the stars and 
the night, &#147;I&#39;m going after him tonight.&#148; To Anthy&#39;s utter shock, she 
simply let herself fall right out of the open window before dropping 
down like a cat to the ground far below her.
 
&#147;You shouldn&#39;t face him alone!&#148; Anthy leaned out the window to yell, but 
Utena was simply gone from her sight. Swearing softly under her breath, 
Anthy rushed out of the room into the hallway, down the old stairs, and 
then out of the building after her.
 
Utena let her body fall, then with a unearthly twist she landed smoothly 
onto her feet. Anthy yelled something to her, but Utena didn&#39;t hear it 
through the blood that pulsed through her veins, driven by pure fury. 
Utena loped across the deserted school grounds with purely inhuman 
speed, focused on one thing only: killing Touga.
 
The Observatory was badly neglected, abandoned long ago by all of those 
who had any sense in this vampire haunted place. This was where Akio had 
slowly changed the student council into his vampire servants, where 
debauched orgies of death and violence had taken place. This was where 
Utena&#39;s life had ended, and then in a spurt of Akio&#39;s foul blood had 
begun again...
 
Utena felt her rage rising up to fill her, fangs extending automatically 
and she fought to hold it back. She grasped the heavy door in her hands 
and with a single surge of unearthly strength tore it right from it&#39;s 
moorings. She stepped inside the shadowed front room, and was almost 
instantly set upon, a foul stench early driving her back!
 
Saionji gibbered and howled, his claw like hands raking at her face, 
filthy green hair wild as it flopped about in a rough ponytail. Utena 
was slammed to the ground by his first leap, his fetid breath turning 
her stomach as she tried to fight free. With his fangs he viciously 
snapped at her face as she held him away, seeking something to chew.
 
Utena got a foot between them and kicked outward, sending him flying 
backward across the room. Seizing the moment she kicked again, this time 
back at the door frame and soon held a jagged piece of lumber in her 
hand. `It&#39;s a poor stake,&#39; she thought to herself grimly as she turned 
to face the recovering Saionji, `but it&#39;ll have to do.&#39;
 
Saionji circled her a bit more cautiously as she strode forward, knowing 
what wood could do to a vampire. &#147;Nothing should disturb the master,&#148; he 
slurred out, licking his chops like a dog, his once fine uniform simply 
dirty rags.
 
&#147;You were captain of the kendo team,&#148; Utena plead with him as she held 
the stake ready, &#147;admired by all the students. You don&#39;t have to be 
Kiryuu&#39;s dog!&#148;
 
Making her words a lie Saionji charged right at Utena, howling at her 
madly. He ripped at her, clawed at her guard and tried his best to get 
at her throat bare. She sweep kicked his long legs, brought him down to 
the floor and then leaped down on top of him. She held him down, feeling 
sick as she realized that he had an erection.
 
In a smooth motion Utena drove the wood into his chest and through the 
heart, and Saionji&#39;s body arched upward. His eyes seemed to clear for a 
moment as he gasped out, &#147;Thank you.&#148; Then he convulsed, and was still.
 
Utena got up, fighting back her illness as a sudden burst of stench 
radiated from Saionji. She pulled a decorative blade down off the wall, 
then in a single stroke she removed the head from the rotting body. 
&#147;Rest in peace, you poor bastard,&#148; Utena murmured to him softly. She 
looked around her, and saw the elevator waiting. `Why do I get the 
feeling he&#39;d cut the cable?&#39; Utena thought wryly of Touga. Instead, she 
decided to take the stairs.
 
The stairway spiraled up the length of the tower, and as she walked, she 
almost thought she could hear women chanting. She couldn&#39;t make out all 
of the words, but one bit kept on repeating over and over again, 
&#147;Absolute destiny apocalypse.&#148; The chant grew louder and louder, until 
finally she reached the very top of the stairway.
 
Looking around the corner carefully, Utena saw that someone had done 
some fairly serious remodeling. The furniture was all gone, the floor 
completely bare except for the tiles that formed the image of a giant 
rose. Touga watched the ladies chant, smiling to himself widely as he 
sat in a throne like chair. Occasionally, he would call one of the girls 
over and hand her a gleaming straight razor. She would draw it across a 
vein, filling up his wine glass until he waved her away yet again.
 
Utena took a breath, more out of reflex than anything else, gripped her 
sword and improvised stake firmly, and stepped out into the massive 
room. &#147;Kiryuu,&#148; she said loudly, &#147;I&#39;m here.&#148;
 
He jerked up, and Touga looked honestly surprised to see her standing so 
brazenly on his very doorstep. &#147;Tenjou,&#148; he scrambled to his feet, and 
then gave her a charming, snake like smile as he said, &#147;would you care 
for a drink?&#148; He made a sweeping gesture towards the young women nearby, 
who all smiled at Utena glassily.
 
Utena&#39;s jaw clenched as her fangs seemed to ache with need, and she 
fought down her first response, to take one of the girls that had been 
so cruelly offered her. &#147;This stops now, Kiryuu,&#148; Utena said to him 
coldly, beginning to pace towards him with deliberate slowness, across 
the gleaming floor that was so much like an dueling arena.
 
Touga met her eyes, and whatever it was he saw in them he didn&#39;t much 
like. &#147;Stop her,&#148; sounding more than a bit frightened he commanded the 
mob of girls. They scrambled to obey him, charging towards Utena at a 
mad gallop.
 
Even with her supernatural speed they climbed all over her, and all 
Utena could do was silently swear as Touga laughed with false amusement. 
`I can&#39;t hurt them, they&#39;re all innocents,&#39; she thought, struggling 
under the pile of nubile flesh. Bare breasts brushed her face, long legs 
tangling with hers, the scent of female in heat washing over her. Fresh 
blood splattered some of them, overwhelming her with it&#39;s sweetness, and 
Utena could feel her fangs extend, demanding to be used. Utena fought 
for control, and then a forbidden idea occurred to her.
 
Not letting herself take a moment to reconsider, Utena bit down fiercely 
on one girl&#39;s bare breast, her joyous cry echoing around the room. 
Letting her instincts take over Utena bit down on another, and another, 
and another. `He bound them with the power of his mind,&#39; she thought 
grimly, `but I&#39;ve just bound them to me by blood.&#39;
 
Laying there on the bare floor the girls gathered all around her, 
looking up at Utena in pure adoration, their excitement feeding the 
hunger within her. &quot;Mistress,&quot; a familiar face purred out, looking at 
Utena hungrily.
 
&#147;Get out of here,&#148; Utena managed to get the words out past her aching 
fangs, past her surging desire to feed on the beautiful girls, &#147;and 
don&#39;t come back.&#148; The girls all but ran down the stairs, leaving Utena 
and Touga there alone.
 
&#147;I didn&#39;t think you had it in you, Tenjou,&#148; Touga remarked casually, his 
log red hair flowing in a graceful wave sown his back. He added with a 
impish smile, &#147;Maybe you&#39;re more like the other vampires than you&#39;d like 
to believe.&#148;
 
&#147;I&#39;m nothing like you,&#148; Utena scowled. `Or am I?&#39; she found herself 
wondering. `I did that to them so very, very easily. And their blood 
tasted so good!&#39; she thought, a faint shudder running through her long 
slim body.
 
Touga laughed softly. &#147;You&#39;re more like us than those simpering human 
cattle.&quot; He paused, tilting his head as he listened, &quot;What happened to 
Saionji?&quot;
 
&quot;Dead,&quot; Utena answered, &quot;for good, this time.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s a waste,&quot; Touga actually sounded a bit regretful. &quot;Join us, 
Utena, and you could help me rule over all the vampires at Ohtori,&#148; he 
invited.
 
Surprisingly, Utena smiled at him sadly. &#147;What I really want,&#148; she said 
to him softly, &#147;you can&#39;t offer me, Touga. I want to feel the sun on my 
face again, and to know the warm touch of another human being without 
wanting to kill them.&#148;
 
Touga&#39;s eyes met Utena&#39;s in the dim chamber and in them she saw that 
something, some deeply buried piece of his former humanity still 
understood her wish, and also understood that she couldn&#39;t be tempted by 
him. He smiled with a odd kind of regret, and then without changing 
expression or stance he charged.
 
Utena let him run at her, standing there completely calm in the center 
of the rose emblem. His eyes were glazed with pure madness, his hands 
stretched out to rip her apart. And still she stood there waiting, 
serene. He reached her, fanged mouth going for her throat, when he 
stiffened.
 
Touga looked down in shock at the stake that she had so calmly used his 
own charge to drive home. He frantically tried to grab at the wood, but 
it was simply too slick, covered with his own blood and gore. He swayed 
there, then weakly dropped to his knees in front of her. He looked up 
dazedly, and saw Utena readying the sword.
 
&#147;Please,&#148; was all Touga got out before she swung.
 
Utena watched the headless body drop, and she just felt so cold inside. 
She had managed to kill two of the vampires tonight and she knew should 
be feeling proud of herself. But she had chosen to taste a human&#39;s blood 
and a fire now raged inside of her body as she stood there in the 
echoing silence. Somehow, Utena knew that just drinking the blood of 
wild animals wasn&#39;t going to be enough to satisfy her hungers anymore.
 
Utena heard her cautiously coming up the stairs before the sound could 
have even reached human ears. &#147;Hello, Anthy,&#148; she said softly, &#147;nice of 
you to join the party.&#148;
 
Anthy entered the room carefully, holding a wooden stake ready to be 
used, and she gasped softly when she saw the blood all around Utena&#39;s 
mouth, the aura of feral power that seemed to radiate off Utena. She 
seemed more dangerous, somehow, as if some hidden part of her had been 
finally unleashed. &#147;I saw those girls outside, and I noticed all the 
blood and fang marks,&#148; Anthy said to her cautiously, fully on her guard.
 
&#147;Touga controlled them with his mind,&#148; Utena explained to her softly, 
still looking down at Touga&#39;s still form, &#147;I needed something stronger 
to get them out of his grip.&#148;
 
&#147;Are you all right?&#148; Anthy asked her softly.
 
Utena looked up to meet her eyes, her own dark and nearly unreadable. 
&#147;No, I&#39;m not all right,&#148; she answered Anthy softly, her long pink hair 
flowing around her face as she conceded, &#147;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be all 
right ever again.&#148; She bent down to pick up Touga&#39;s remains and sighed, 
&#147;Let&#39;s get rid of this, and Saionji downstairs.&#148;
 
On the lawn outside the tower the vampires&#39; corpses were quickly placed 
on a improvised bonfire and in a few short moments it was lit. The blaze 
warmed Utena&#39;s body as she looked into the scarlet flames, watching the 
ever-changing fire. Looked at what was very likely to be her own fate, 
one day soon to come.
 
The girls that had been forced to serve Touga milled around for a bit 
nearby, then made their way over to where Utena and Anthy were standing, 
drawing close to Utena herself. Utena frowned at one of the naked young 
women and asked, &#147;What do you want?&#148;
 
&#147;To serve you, Mistress,&#148; she said dreamily.
 
&#147;The blood bond,&#148; Anthy murmured, her eyes wide as she realized what 
Utena had done.
 
Utena looked at the gathering young women, then over at Anthy. &#147;How do I 
free them?&#148; she asked Anthy rather desperately.
 
Anthy sighed softly, &#147;You can&#39;t.&#148;
 
 
Watching from the shadows of the nearby buildings it took all of Juri&#39;s 
self control not to start laughing aloud at the stunned expression on 
poor Utena&#39;s face. Things had worked out even better than she had 
initially planned.
 
Having Shiori plant that note she wrote in Touga&#39;s own handwriting with 
the girl&#39;s body had been a stroke of genius on Juri&#39;s part. In one 
stroke two rivals of hers had been eliminated, and in the process Utena 
had been forced to taste human blood at long last.
 
And now Utena had an small army of thralls following her around, all of 
them sweetly willing to do whatever she may want. Juri wondered how long 
even Utena&#39;s strength of will could hold out against all those willing 
young girls. She didn&#39;t think for very long.
 
With a broad smile, Juri silently made her way off into the night.</pre>
