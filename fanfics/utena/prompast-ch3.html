<h1>Promises Past (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakablonde.html">Bakablonde</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/prompast-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Whap! The fencing foil whipped the cover off the top bunk. With another 
swing, Juri flung the cover to the floor. Turning, she slashed at the 
curtains, tying them up in knots. She stopped and dropped the foil to 
the floor, watching it roll on a curve away from her.

&quot;Promises...&quot; she whispered, looking out the window. She gave a deep 
sigh, returned to her bed, and began to undress. Boots were placed 
carefully under the bed. Socks landed a few feet away. The pants soon 
followed. She looked down at the red lip marks on them, staring without 
anger. She reached down and traced over the outline of the lips with her 
fingers, as if in a trance. Her head jerked up at a sudden loud banging 
at the door.

&quot;Juri-senpai! I know you&#39;re in there!&quot; Miki&#39;s voice had a tone she&#39;d 
never heard. Her eyes widened and she quickly grabbed her bathrobe, 
tossing it over her top. She took a deep breath, then went to the door 
and opened it.

&quot;Miki, I-&quot; her breath caught at the sight of Miki&#39;s enraged face, and 
that of Kozue, her cheek swollen pink with tears in her eyes, standing 
behind him. She stepped back as Miki pushed his way into her room, 
Kozue&#39;s hand in his. Juri closed the door and leaned against it for 
support.

&quot;If you want a fight, senpai, do it with me. Otherwise you apologize to 
my sister right now!&quot; Miki was shaking with both fear and anger, his 
eyes glinting. Not wanting to aggravate him further, Juri straightened 
herself up, and walked toward Kozue. Kozue stood with her head down, 
sniffling.

&quot;Kozue...I&#39;m sorry I hurt you.&quot; her voice was soft and sincere, and 
Kozue sobbed, letting go of Miki&#39;s hand and sliding her arms under 
Juri&#39;s robe, hugging her tightly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry too. I won&#39;t ever mention 
her name again. I swear.&quot; Her voice was muffled, her face buried in 
Juri&#39;s chest. It seemed so genuine that Juri put her arms around her, 
comforting her. &quot;I should never have hit you. I apologize for my 
temper.&quot;

She looked up to see Miki smiling, tears in his eyes. &quot;Now you two make 
up.&quot; he admonished, backing towards the door. &quot;Even if it takes all 
night.&quot; He winked at Juri. &quot;Good thing it&#39;s the weekend, huh?&quot;

&quot;All night!&quot; Juri cried out in alarm, as Miki opened the door. &quot;Miki, 
wait a minute. Miki!&quot; she called out as the door clicked shut. She felt 
a surge of panic and went to pull away, but Kozue&#39;s grip tightened. 
&quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot; she sniffed. &quot;Just for a minute, Juri, okay?&quot;

&quot;Can you go for a whole minute without groping me, Kozue?&quot; her arms 
slipped hesitantly back over Kozue&#39;s shoulders. She felt Kozue smiling. 
&quot;Oh, at least two or three. I&#39;ve got a little self-control, you know.&quot; 
Juri smiled down at the top of Kozue&#39;s head. They stood quietly together 
for a moment, until Kozue cleared her throat.

&quot;I really am sorry, Juri. I wasn&#39;t just saying that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry too. I...have a problem with my temper sometimes. It&#39;s a 
family weakness.&quot; Juri released herself from the embrace, once again 
surprised that Kozue let her go so easily. She picked up her pants and 
socks off the floor, heading to the bathroom hamper with them. &quot;I don&#39;t 
suppose you&#39;re going to be leaving anytime soon.&quot; she called out 
smoothly, rubbing some soapy water over the stain on her pants. &quot;Of 
course not.&quot; floated back the reply. Juri wrung out the pants and tossed 
them into the hamper. She made her way back to the room, her lip 
twisting in thought.

&quot;Well, then, I- Kozue!&quot; she gasped out in surprise at the sight of a 
naked Kozue bending over an open cabinet door. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re 
doing?&quot;

&quot;Looking for your booze.&quot; Kozue&#39;s reply was nonchalant. &quot;I know you have 
some in here.&quot; she peered into the cabinet door. &quot;I thought we&#39;d have a 
drink.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t drink naked.&quot; Juri pointed to another cabinet, and Kozue opened 
it. She took out the brown bottle and two glasses, frowning. &quot;Bailey&#39;s 
Irish Cream? That&#39;s it?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t had time to re-stock.&quot; Juri suddenly felt hot under her robe, 
and began fingering the neckline. Kozue glanced up from pouring the 
drinks. &quot;Good grief, Juri, I&#39;ve already seen you naked. Take that 
hideous robe off.&quot;

Juri scowled and went over by the bed, carefully removing the robe and 
hanging it on the bunk poster. &quot;I know this robe is ugly. I wear it... 
just because it was my mother&#39;s.&quot; she sighed and turned around, pointing 
to the large leather easy chair that took up a large portion of her 
room. &quot;That chair was her favorite. That&#39;s why I brought it here.&quot; she 
spoke softly, going over to chair and running her hand along the top in 
a gentle caress.

&quot;So your mother...&quot; Kozue was behind her, handing her a glass. Juri took 
a few sips, sighed, and slipped into the chair, pulling it back with the 
lever, stretching out her feet. &quot;Cancer. I was twelve.&quot; her eyes were 
closed, remembering. &quot;I brought her tea in this chair many times.&quot; she 
sighed again. &quot;Many times.&quot;

The chair arm creaked with Kozue&#39;s weight as she settled on it. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Juri. I didn&#39;t know that.&quot;

&quot;Not many people do.&quot; Juri opened her eyes and looked at Kozue, letting 
the implication sink in. Kozue slowly raised her glass. &quot;Let&#39;s drink a 
toast in honor of your mother then.&quot; she said softly.

They looked silently at each other, then Juri raised her glass, clinking 
it with Kozue&#39;s. &quot;To mother.&quot; she took a sip and closed her eyes, 
leaning back in the chair. Kozue slid forward, slowly edging into her 
lap, gripping the inside of Juri&#39;s thigh just below her underwear.

&quot;Kozue, has anyone ever told you how persistent you are?&quot; Juri&#39;s hand 
stopped her.

&quot;Has anyone ever told you how stubborn you are?&quot; Kozue quipped, watching 
Juri drain the last of her drink with her free hand.

&quot;Has anyone ever told you that you grope like a desperate schoolboy? 
You&#39;d get further with me if you were just a little gentler!&quot; Juri 
blurted out, then colored as she realized what she had said. She smacked 
her glass down on the table next to the chair, carefully keeping her 
head turned away from Kozue. &quot;Not that it matters, really.&quot; she stared 
intently at the glass, tapping it with her forefinger. She slowly closed 
her eyes, as if her thoughts were elsewhere.

She stiffened as Kozue&#39;s lips grazed her ear. &quot;I can be gentle, Juri, if 
that&#39;s what you want.&quot; Kozue&#39;s hand was in her hair, stroking her. 
Another hand began to undo the collar of her jacket, twisting the 
buttons slowly. &quot;Tonight, whatever you want, I&#39;ll do it.&quot; her hand 
loosened more buttons, until Juri&#39;s jacket hung open freely on her body. 
Kozue slid her hand under the jacket, pushing it to one side. &quot;So 
beautiful.&quot; she whispered. Juri caught her hand and brought it up to her 
lips, eyes still closed, and kissed it.

&quot;Kozue.&quot; She murmured, &quot;You say you&#39;ll do anything I ask?&quot;

&quot;Anything, for a night with you. I&#39;m not afraid to try anything.&quot;

&quot;Promise?&quot; more soft kisses, with the tip of a tongue, were planted on 
Kozue&#39;s hand, and Kozue&#39;s eyes narrowed with desire. She slid herself 
around so that she was straddling Juri, and took Juri&#39;s face in her 
hands, pulling her so that their eyes met. Juri had a dreamy look on her 
face as she smiled at Kozue. &quot;Anything, Juri. I promise.&quot;

&quot;Two things.&quot; Juri&#39;s voice hardened. Her gaze became more focused, and 
the smile disappeared. &quot;First, I want to know what the hell you put in 
my drink.&quot;

Kozue&#39;s mouth opened, then she hung her head. &quot;Valium.&quot;

&quot;How many?&quot; Juri&#39;s hands were on her shoulders, and she shook them once, 
sharply. &quot;How many, Kozue?&quot; she slammed her head back into the chair, 
covering her face with her hands in frustration, her long hair cascading 
around her shoulders. &quot;So if you can&#39;t fuck me, then you&#39;ll kill me? How 
many?&quot;

&quot;Just... two. I thought...I thought it would help you relax.&quot; Kozue 
stammered. Juri heaved a large sigh that was part yawn, and hung her 
head down. Kozue shifted uneasily at the silence. &quot;Is the other 
thing...that you want me to leave?&quot; she waited, but there was no answer. 
&quot;Juri?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was tired, but still had an edge to it. &quot;I want to 
make sure you&#39;re close by when I come out of this. It will be easier to 
kill you.&quot;

Kozue&#39;s eyes widened at the threat, and she swallowed audibly. She went 
to move back but Juri&#39;s hands grabbed her thighs, gripping her hard. 
&quot;Leaving the scene of the crime?&quot; Juri&#39;s tone dropped a notch, in a way 
that made Kozue&#39;s heart race. She put her hands back to Juri&#39;s face, 
sweeping away the long hair. Juri tossed her head back and Kozue saw a 
spark in her drugged eyes that both frightened and excited her. &quot;Stand 
up, Kozue.&quot;

Kozue stood and Juri scooted forward, wiggling out of her jacket, 
dropping it and the last of her inhibitions to the floor. Kozue drew in 
a sharp breath at the sight of Juri in her bra and underwear. She 
started back in toward her target but grunted as Juri&#39;s foot caught her 
between her breasts, stopping her.

&quot;So far, you&#39;ve tarnished my reputation, humiliated me in public, groped 
me incessantly, and drugged me against my will. Can you think of any 
reason why I should let you touch me?&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was low with sleep 
and anger. Her foot was pressing harder now, and Kozue found it 
difficult to breathe.

&quot;Maybe you should punish me&quot;. Kozue said suggestively, with what air she 
could muster.

&quot;You would love to spread that one around the school, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; 
Juri&#39;s foot moved slightly over, pressing Kozue&#39;s left breast so hard 
she winced. &quot;Ah- Juri, I won&#39;t say anything. I promise.&quot;

&quot;Not a word?&quot; Juri&#39;s foot eased up and began to slide down her belly. 
Kozue put her finger to her lips.

Juri dropped her foot and put her legs together, patting her lap. &quot;Come 
here, pretty girl.&quot;

Kozue was instantly over the fencer&#39;s muscular thighs that were now 
tensed with excitement, muscles flexing into her own taught belly. The 
anticipated hard smack across her ass never happened. Kozue hung her 
head down, eyes closed, waiting. After what seemed like an eternity, 
Juri&#39;s long hair began to trail tantalizingly down her back, as she 
leaned over her, silky wisps tickling and teasing. Juri&#39;s strong 
fingertips soon followed, tracing every bone, pressing every soft spot, 
working their way down her back, sliding slowly, so slowly, across her 
ass that Kozue thought she would never breathe again.

&quot;Spread.&quot; came the command and Kozue did as told, still holding her 
breath. Juri&#39;s fingers slid leisurely along her inner thighs, exploring 
her, taunting her. Juri leaned down further over her, until teeth and 
lips met tingling skin, aching for fulfillment. Kozue arched 
involuntarily and Juri pushed her back down, mouth firmly nipping her 
ass. Long fingers met with wet eagerness and Juri continued her tease 
with long strokes as Kozue&#39;s breath shortened with excitement. A long 
finger slid easily inside her and Kozue could no longer contain herself, 
moaning loudly. Another followed, and Kozue pushed back with her hips, 
feeling Juri plunge into her harder. &quot;Oh Juri...&quot; Kozue groaned with 
delight. The fingers were removed and Kozue was roughly pushed to the 
floor.

&quot;Juri!&quot; Kozue&#39;s cry was now one of surprise and disappointment.

&quot;Finish it yourself. You have two hands.&quot; Juri wiggled her own fingers, 
arching an eyebrow. Kozue glared at her and started to get up, but Juri 
waved her hand at her.

&quot;Right there. As you are. On the floor, where I can see you.&quot; Juri 
leaned back and crossed her legs, waiting. They stared intently at one 
another. Kozue slid back a little till her backside was against the 
cabinet, facing Juri. Her fingers slid down between her legs, now spread 
apart. Juri&#39;s hands gripped the chair tighter with each motion of 
Kozue&#39;s hand, her eyes taking in all of her, her eyes half open with 
desire and intoxication, her nostrils flaring with the scent of Kozue&#39;s 
arousal. All too quickly Kozue jerked upwards, calling out Juri&#39;s name, 
shaking the cabinet. She rolled to her side weakly, trying to catch her 
breath. Juri leaned back, her breathing measured, closing her eyes.

&quot;Go take a shower.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; Kozue was staring at the darkened dampness of Juri&#39;s 
underwear. Juri looked down and ran her fingertips along the elastic 
edge in a teasing fashion. &quot;You don&#39;t deserve to watch me or touch me. 
Go wash up. Take your time.&quot; Juri crossed her legs in dismissal. With a 
sigh of regret, Kozue left the room.

----------

Kozue&#39;s bare feet left little wet spots on the floor as she made her way 
back to the main room, idly wondering why Juri had not put her bed in 
the small bedroom available. Not hearing any sounds of movement, she was 
not too surprised to see that Juri had succumbed to the Valium and was 
fast asleep in the chair, which had been put back slightly, and the 
footrest extended. Juri lay on her side, her long legs tensing 
periodically as if she were fencing in her dreams. Kozue stood watching 
her, taking in each line and curve of her body with appreciation. &quot;You 
make me wish I was an artist, Juri.&quot; she whispered softly, so as not to 
wake her. She sighed and let her eye wander around the rest of the room. 
An antique dresser with pictures on it caught her eye.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I check out your family, do you?&quot; she leaned over Juri, 
sniffing her hair. &quot;Hmmm- didn&#39;t think so.&quot; She hummed softly as she 
went over to the dresser to do her investigation. The first picture was 
of two adults, obviously Juri&#39;s parents. It was a formal portrait. Kozue 
stared hard at Juri&#39;s mother, noting the same striking eyes, cheekbones, 
and curling hair. Her mother&#39;s hair was a burnished copper color. Kozue 
decided Juri was prettier and set the picture down. There were other 
pictures, all of which seemed to be formal, or of some event. Juri, her 
mother and her father, all well-dressed, rarely smiling. The last few 
were of Juri and her father. Her father was a tall man, Juri&#39;s head not 
even reaching his shoulder. Kozue saw a smaller picture lying facedown 
and lifted it up. Her mouth opened with surprise as she looked at the 
two young girls smiling and holding hands. Even at a young age, the 
features were unmistakable.

&quot;Shiori.&quot; she gripped the edge of the dresser, her mind in shock. She 
stared at the picture for several more moments, then looked back at the 
sleeping form on the chair. &quot;Happy...you look so different here.&quot; she 
said sadly, comparing Juri&#39;s face with the other photos on the dresser. 
She went to lay the photo back down and noticed an album beneath it. She 
stood thumbing through the photo album, the soft cracking of old plastic 
sheets making the only sound in the room as she looked into Juri&#39;s 
childhood. More pictures of what seemed to be birthdays, family 
gatherings. Juri was immaculately well groomed and dressed in all of 
them. &quot;What, they didn&#39;t have mud in your neighborhood?&quot; Kozue muttered 
under her breath. Her gaze narrowed as she saw other pictures of Juri 
and Shiori. There were some of Juri with several other children, most 
with the same copper-colored hair as her mother. She turned the page 
again and gasped softly at the large newsprint of photo of Juri&#39;s 
mother, announcing her mother&#39;s death.

&quot;Lady Arisugawa passed away at home yesterday...&quot; her voice faded as she 
read the rest of the article. She turned the page when done, but the 
rest of the album was empty. She was ready to close the book when she 
noticed some photos bunched in a plastic baggie in the back. Brows 
knitted with curiosity, she emptied the bag onto the dresser. &quot;What the 
hell...&quot; she stammered, looking at the young girl on the stage, her 
mother proudly holding her hand. Photo after photo were all the same- 
Juri on a runway, Juri onstage, Juri bowing to a crowd. &quot;Little beauty 
queen, huh Juri? But why stick these back here?&quot;

A creak of leather and a soft moan from Juri snapped Kozue back to the 
present. She furtively set things back in order, then made her way over 
to the chair. Juri had curled up and slid a little to the side. Deciding 
she looked cold, Kozue got the old bathrobe and covered her with it. 
Impulsively she leaned over and kissed her softly on the forehead. She 
tilted her head to one side, thinking. Then she climbed into the chair 
with Juri, crammed herself in tightly, and pulled the robe over them 
both.

----------

&quot;Mmm.&quot; Juri wrinkled her nose as she awoke from her deep slumber. She 
sniffed again, and became aware that her head was on Kozue&#39;s shoulder, 
her nose buried in the hollow of Kozue&#39;s neck, and the wonderful smell 
was Kozue herself. &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; she murmured into Kozue&#39;s skin, 
too tired to move.

&quot;You&#39;re sleeping, and I&#39;m reading.&quot; Kozue&#39;s voice floated softly down to 
her ears.

&quot;I must be dreaming. You said you were reading.&quot;

&quot;Shakespeare. Something about taming a shrew.&quot; Kozue twisted her head 
and smiled, even though Juri couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;Reminds me of someone I 
know.&quot; she whispered softly.

&quot;My neck is killing me.&quot; Juri groaned. Kozue got up from the chair and 
whipped the robe off Juri, eliciting angry mumbles. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful 
when you&#39;re mad.&quot; she laughed, leaning over to pull Juri up. &quot;C&#39;mon, 
we&#39;re going to bed.&quot; Juri moved slowly and stiffly, still drugged. She 
leaned heavily onto Kozue as they made their way across the floor. Kozue 
reached out and cut the light off, causing them both to sway 
momentarily, and Juri fell forward the last few feet into the bed, 
landing with a solid thud. &quot;Ow.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. Scoot over. Unless you want me to sleep on top of you.&quot; Kozue&#39;s 
words caused Juri to groan again, and slide over. Kozue slid her arm 
over Juri&#39;s ribs and Juri grabbed her hand weakly. &quot;Don&#39;t-&quot; Juri 
started, but was shushed gently by Kozue. &quot;Relax.&quot; Kozue, warm along 
Juri&#39;s backside, made no other move. &quot;I just want to hold you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why.&quot; Juri grunted, settling into Kozue&#39;s curved body. 
Soon her breathing became deeper and slower, and Kozue softly slid her 
hand up to Juri&#39;s heart, feeling the strong beat. &quot;I don&#39;t know why 
either.&quot; she whispered into the night, as her eyes closed.</pre>
