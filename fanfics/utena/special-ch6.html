<h1>A Special Case (part 6 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/special-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>I arrived early at Capital Toyotei. I wanted to have a drink and watch 
my client arrive. I&#146;m not sure why. When she did, I probably stared 
just like the guy next to me did. And the guy next to him. Her hair 
was down and the dress she wore was elegant, but understated. She 
didn&#146;t scream &quot;look at me!&quot; the way so many pretty women do, but she 
was very lovely. There was that something, again, that maturity about 
her. She was polite to everyone, from the valet who escorted her in, 
to the coat check girl, to the maitre d&#146;. Everyone got that same sweet 
smile, those same guarded eyes. I rose and met her in the lobby and 
she greeted me warmly, took my arm and we were seated. This was a bit 
of a surprise. Capital Toyotei may not be the most exclusive 
restaurant in Kyoto, but you&#146;re never just seated. Except for today.

Our table was apart from the others; at least one table had been 
removed to give us some privacy. As we arranged ourselves, nearly 
everyone in the restaurant surreptiously stared. A few meaningfully 
envious looks were thrown my way, I didn&#146;t notice if any were thrown 
at my client.

At last we were left alone and the murmur died down. Silence fell 
between us. I belatedly remembered to hand over the printed report - 
Miss Himemiya thanked me but did not open the envelope. 

&quot;Let&#146;s enjoy ourselves, shall we? Business later.&quot;

I nodded and we placed our orders. I tried not to look at the prices, 
but decided that as this was her call, she could pay. Call me 
mercenary.

Dinner was good. I&#146;ll never be a huge fan of French cuisine, but this 
chef had made it onto Iron Chef. He deserved it too. By coffee, I was 
pleasantly sated with rich, unhealthy food and reasonably reasonable. 
I suggested we commence with the business portion of our meeting since 
it was getting late.

My client raised her tea to her lips and nodded. &quot;By all means.&quot;

I began to describe my meeting with the Kiryuu&#146;s and she made no 
comments. When I finished up with the little chat in the elevator, her 
only response was, &quot;Ah, Nanami. How I miss her.&quot; I tried, 
unsuccessfully, to hear the sarcasm in her voice; I&#146;d have to swear 
there wasn&#146;t any. When I mentioned that Kaoru was here in Kyoto, 
however, Miss Himemiya changed completely. Her smile faded and her 
face grew bleak.

&quot;When? How long? Does he know I&#146;m here?&quot; Her knuckles were white as 
she gripped her teacup.

&quot;About 6 months ago. I don&#146;t think so. But,&quot; I cautioned, &quot;I don&#146;t 
think you&#146;ve been hiding, have you?&quot; She did not answer and I pressed. 
&quot;Why, Miss Himemiya? Why did he tell me he couldn&#146;t remember your 
face, or Utena&#146;s? Why does Kiryuu Nanami warn me away from you?&quot; I 
leaned forward and lightly touched her hand. The shock that ran 
through me threw me backwards into my chair. It was all I could do not 
to topple over. I felt as if someone had laid a defibrillator against 
my chest &#150; while my heart was still beating. I sucked in some air, 
trying not to be obvious, and waited while my client&#146;s face thawed. 
The look I had seen in her eyes in that one moment would have made a 
charging rhino take a step back. I didn&#146;t much feel up to challenging 
her.

That was it for dinner. She was all business, waving away my 
insistence that I pay -exactly what I was hoping for; she took care of 
the check briskly and we were obsequied out the front door.

&quot;Please walk with me,&quot; she requested, and gestured to her side. I took 
my position and she threaded her arm through mine as we walked. The 
botanical gardens were lit, but not open. We strolled along the street 
in silence. Light traffic passed, and neither of us wanted to say 
anything that would confuse, or hurt. Anything at all, really. I was 
still keyed up from the earlier shock and too tense to think clearly.

After a few blocks, I felt myself calming down. As if that released 
her from her 

silence, my client began to speak. &quot;Once upon a time there was a 
Princess&#133;&quot;

I always hated fairy stories, but I guessed hers was not your average 
story. A Princess who wanted to save Princesses and thus become a 
Prince. And a Prince who had sacrificed himself to save Princesses and 
had become sick. And a Princess who was a witch and did terrible 
things to save the Prince. Lots of Princesses. Lots of unhappiness.

I looked down at my client as we walked and saw to my surprise, that 
she had tears on her eyelashes. They glittered in the light from the 
streetlamps. I pulled a handkerchief from my pocket and offered it to 
her. Glancing up at me, she thanked me with a small smile. Her eyes 
wet with tears, that sad smile of gratitude as she looked up at me -- 
she was beautiful. My heart stopped beating and I felt as stricken as 
anyone ever had by anyone they had ever loved. My god, she was 
beautiful.

She turned away again, but I could not stop seeing that face, so lost 
and alone, in my mind. I found myself thinking that if I were a Prince 
and she was the Princess, I&#146;d die to save her too. Eventually I 
remembered to breathe.

We walked in silence again. At last I found the strength to ask the 
question I had wanted to from the first time we met. &quot;Who are you?&quot; I 
whispered into the night.

&quot;I am the witch.&quot; She said.

My head spun. When Kiryuu Nanami had called her a &quot;witch&quot; I thought, 
well, obviously I thought she meant it as an insult. But&#133;

&quot;There&#146;s no such things as witches,&quot; I began, but Miss Himemiya put 
her hand on my mouth to stop me. She pulled it away slowly. I could 
feel the warmth of her fingers on my lips. 

&quot;Please.&quot; She sounded terribly sad and old. &quot;Let&#146;s just walk.&quot;

We walked. I left her at her apartment and she asked me to keep trying 
to find Utena. &quot;At least interview the last two Student Council 
members&#133;then you are free to drop the case.&quot;

&quot;I won&#146;t drop the case.&quot; I said, then leaned down to kiss her cheek. 
When I last saw her, she stood at her door, her hand pressed to her 
cheek where I had kissed it.

I slept that night more deeply than usual. I awoke refreshed and 
vaguely remembering a dream about castles and Princes and Princesses 
and lots of other things I didn&#146;t believe in.
