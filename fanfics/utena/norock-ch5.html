<a href="../utena/norock-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Something Amiss

Anthy Himemiya, the dark skinned beauty who was the owner of a very 
celebrated catering and floral business, sat back in her easy chair in 
front of the television set. She looked somewhat rumpled, a startling 
contrast from the flawlessness she presented for her clients. Her mind 
was whirling.

I know what I saw...what the camera picked up. But...how can this be? 
It&#39;s simply not possible...

But it had to be, although what it could signify, she wasn&#39;t quite sure. 
Idly she ran a hand over her shoulder as if expecting a small furry 
companion to be sitting there. But that was right...he had long since 
left her side. Anthy tiredly leaned forward, her head in her hand, her 
blouse loosely unbuttoned. Her tailored suit jacket had been tossed 
carelessly onto the floor, next to a stack of papers and articles she 
had clipped out of magazines and newspapers. A stack of cds were next to 
the stereo system she had installed. All with her face on them.

Anthy closed emerald eyes and leaned back again, soft lips dropping the 
name in a sigh. &quot;Utena...how is it that you&#39;re so close...yet feel so 
far away from me? Why won&#39;t you remember?&quot;

She clicked off the t.v. set, where Utena and her band had been guests 
on some talk show. It had been so achingly wonderful to see that pink 
hair sway with her movements...that slender athletic form capturing the 
audience with her gestures and grace behind the mic...and those clear 
blue sky eyes...

She sat up again, her eyes narrowed as a frown marred her expression. 
Those eyes had changed during the show. There had been some sort of 
sound difficulty, but there was no halt of video footage. Her eyes had 
changed from blue to silver...and it wasn&#39;t a trick of the light. Her 
mind ran over several possibilities as to the reason. It would take more 
observation. Perhaps it was the power of Dios she had obtained at that 
fateful final duel...and now even with her memory suppressed, it was 
beginning to leak out in ways that showed. That made her frown all the 
more. It could be dangerous if she didn&#39;t control such raw power...the 
mere implications...

And that led to more frustration...why wouldn&#39;t she at least talk to 
her? And she kept returning all of the flower arrangements Anthy sent to 
her. It was as if Utena hated her...and that thought was unbearable.

She stood as she heard the tea kettle whistle from the stove. Standing 
up, in stockinged feet and loose black slacks, she moved across the 
plush carpet to where her tea was waiting. Then she felt a niggling in 
the back of her mind. Stopping she lifted her head. There...something 
had...changed...she could feel it. Like a cord in a tapestry 
snapping...or tiny bolt in a complex lock sliding away and free...

She moved to where her playing cards were stacked on one table...the 
same ones she and her prince had played with when they were in 
school...back before her disappearance and the memory spell that had 
spiraled out across the campus. She supposed it was for the 
best...better for all involved that no one recalled their savior...the 
one who sacrificed everything just to change things a little bit...

That little bit had been Anthy&#39;s freedom from her brother&#39;s 
control...and the chains of hate and guilt that had been weighing her 
down for as long as she could remember. Maybe that wasn&#39;t the massive 
world-altering revolution everyone had pictured...but it was an 
important one...one that rippled its effects across that isolated school 
campus...

Without the Rose Bride...the games could not continue, although Akio had 
tried. Without her backing, the duels had ceased...the imprisoned 
spirits within the campus itself had finally graduated, and Akio&#39;s 
entire power base and intricate plans had crumbled.

And so Anthy had gone out looking for her prince...her special fair 
skinned protector, to show her just what she had managed to become once 
the egg&#39;s shell had broken. But to no avail. She searched...using every 
ability she had...had hired private detectives...traveled 
Japan...nothing. The smiling girl in the picture had vanished without a 
trace.

Oh...but look...the tea was getting cold. She had been standing dazed in 
recollection.
Focus Anthy...Focus...

She sat down at the dining room table, far too large for just one 
person, and picked up the deck of cards. Taking a sip of the herbal 
brew, and shuffling the cards in her left hand, the dark skinned 
business woman began laying out face down cards in a strange intricate 
pattern...much like a fortune teller with tarot cards.

She turned up the last card, the 2 of spades and frowned. Her eyes went 
blank with a different sort of vision...

Saionji Kyouichi, still dressed in a crumpled kendo uniform sat up 
groggily from atop his mattress. He groaned and place a hand to his 
head. Looking over to his right where the fiery maned Touga sat perched 
in a chair watching him, he growled.

&quot;What the hell was that? I feel like I was hit by a truck...&quot;

Touga gave a dismissive wave of his hand. &quot;It will pass...at least it 
did with me. So how are you...can you...remember?&quot; That last bit came 
out uncertainly. Saionji stared off into open space, a faraway look in 
his violet eyes.

&quot;...yes...I remember everything.&quot; He was quiet for a moment...his 
saffron hair having come loose from it&#39;s ponytail to flow about his 
shoulders like a curtain to hide his expression. He sat up, a scowl on 
his face. &quot;The duels...that girl....Himemiya...how could we have 
forgotten all of that? The trip with World&#39;s End is something I should 
not have so easily forgotten I would think.&quot; He rubbed his arms as if he 
were suddenly cold.

Touga gave that luxuriant shrug of his, &quot;I don&#39;t know...but I imagine it 
has something to do with the final duel.&quot; Saionji gave a nod, and 
scratched the back of his head as he swung his feet over the side of the 
bed. Thankfully Wakaba hadn&#39;t gotten home yet. He would have been hard 
pressed to explain why exactly he had collapsed.

He looked at Touga and gestured at the printed picture he had brought 
with him, from off the internet. &quot;I have to say though...a big 180 from 
the girl we used to know. I wonder what made Tenjou-san change?&quot;

Touga&#39;s gaze darkened. &quot;We never did find out what happened at that 
final duel. Who knows? Maybe the power altered her...or maybe she too 
has forgotten everything. I just don&#39;t know...&quot;

Saionji stood, and stretched out his arms to work the kinks out of his 
back. &quot;So what do you want to do...now that we remember who we are...who 
we were...what do you want to do about it?&quot;

Saionji knew him too well.

Touga stood, &quot;I want to see her again. Meet her face to face. If only to 
fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle.&quot;

Anthy jerked out of the journey her power had allowed her mind to travel 
and pushed the cards away messily. She frowned again, ignoring her tea 
and began to pace, a habit she had picked up from Utena. The memory 
spell was breaking? She had felt the nooses upon two of the old student 
council members fray and then snap. Was this due to the prince being in 
the public eye so much? Seen and loved by many, as it should be? Or was 
it...due to something else. No matter how hard she tried, she just 
couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was amiss. Like a knot of 
dread in the pit of her stomach, twisting and coiling like a sleeping 
snake.

Snakes...Akio?

No, she was dead certain. He was out of the picture. In fact, he was 
even aging at the normal human rate again. The one time she had gone 
back to visit him, looking for clues, she had saw strands of gray in 
that lavender hair...oh-so-carefully hidden from the eyes of many, but 
nothing could be hidden from her eyes. The crows feet at the corners of 
his eyes were yet another sign.

So what was it then? This threat that hung in the air...

Only one way to find out. She needed to speak with Utena alone. Get her 
away from her band and those hounding fans. Get her to talk...if only 
she could jog her memory...

Anthy moved to the phone, glancing at the clock, and began making a 
series of calls.

Never underestimate a witch with a goal.

A lamp crashed into the wall. The coffee table had been flung across the 
room and now lay upside down. Jared himself looked like pure fury 
incarnate standing there breathing hard, his mohawk hanging like a limp 
track of curled hair once he had washed out the stiff glue.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you! What&#39;s with you?!&quot;

Utena sat calmly on the couch, after hearing an extensive tirade from 
the other man. She wished she had a beer or...

&quot;I find stacks of empty bottles in your room, bags of weed, I mean what 
the hell!?&quot;

...or maybe a cigarette...

&quot;And I let it all go...I figure what&#39;s your business is your 
business...&quot;

...the headache was building in her mind again...it hurt...she needed to 
make it stop somehow...

&quot;But you&#39;ve gone too far this time...way too far! You can&#39;t just go 
around threatening talk show hosts like it&#39;s no big deal...and I would 
have even forgiven you that. Maybe you where having a mood swing or 
something. At least you had the bloody sense to turn off your mic.&quot;

...maybe what she needed was a new way to relieve the pain...maybe what 
she needed was...

&quot;But I find you shooting up too?! Track marks! You&#39;ve been hiding track 
marks where we can&#39;t see them! What is your malfunction?! Why won&#39;t you 
talk to us anymore?&quot;

Jared, finally spent, collapsed onto the couch beside her, but she 
continued to stare straight ahead like a doll. He buried his face in his 
hands as he spoke, &quot;Ten...Utena...despite what the tabloids say, we&#39;re 
your friends. Why won&#39;t you tell us what&#39;s happening to you? You&#39;re so 
angry all the time...you&#39;re slipping away from us, and I don&#39;t know what 
to do....What if the company finds out about this? What if they drop 
you? What if the media catches wind? I don&#39;t want to see you 
hurt...please...please...just tell me what&#39;s going on...is it that girl? 
The one that sends you flowers and shit? Bloody hell, I&#39;ll get rid of 
her myself. If that&#39;s what it takes I&#39;ll screen your mail or 
whatever....but please...I...&quot;

He was suddenly cut off as Utena turned to him and placed an arm around 
his shoulders. She brought her face to his, just shy of actually 
touching.

&quot;Do you really want to know?&quot;

Jared found he couldn&#39;t move. Like being caught in headlights...he 
barely managed to get a trembling whisper past his lips, &quot;..ah...yes...&quot;

Utena placed her slender fingers upon his cheek. &quot;Then let me show 
you...&quot;

....It was morning. It was early. And Utena was not pleased to have to 
be out of bed so early to go to some meeting about an upcoming photo 
shoot. And after that, they had some kind of interview scheduled at a 
caf&eacute;. But they hadn&#39;t mentioned who it was for. Most likely some 
magazine or something. Who cared? She had far more important things to 
do...but then again, all of these tedious projects were means to an end 
she supposed...

She moved through the lobby of Pelican Records, the one stationed in 
Japan, and made her way to the board room. Opening the door and stepping 
inside, it was suddenly firmly shut behind her. Whirling around, her 
muscles tense, she found herself staring up into the eyes of a tall man 
with hair like seaweed. He was dressed in a business suit, but her eyes 
flicked to his hands at the calluses. This wasn&#39;t just a suit.

Another man, in a sleek looking three-piece that looked like it had 
stepped out of a G.Q. magazine, was reclined in one of the chairs. 
Warning bells were going off in her head, especially at that self 
assured smirk on the red head&#39;s lips.

&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; Her voice came out steady and cold, with the 
slightest tinge of edge to it. Like a sword that had been lifted 
slightly out of the scabbard.

The man raised hands to metaphorically show he was unarmed. &quot;We wished 
to speak with you, Utena. I hope you don&#39;t mind, I promise you this will 
not take long...&quot;

The green haired man moved to take a seat next to the red haired man, 
sitting perfectly straight in his chair, as if he were used to sitting 
that way for hours on end Tenjou was liking this less and less.

&quot;Look you...my name is Ten. And yes I do mind...especially when I was 
called down here for business and find it was some hoax.&quot;

The man stood and gave a bow. &quot;Please...I see you do not recall us. Then 
for the sake of introduction, my name is Touga Kiryuu. This is Saionji 
Kyouichi. We once went to the same school as you.&quot; Utena snorted and 
walked over onto to other side of the table from them, plopping down 
into a chair and thunking a boot onto the polish mahogany.

&quot;Great...another one. You two going to start sending me roses also? 
Look, I&#39;m really getting tired of this...people popping out of the wood 
work to say they &#39;went to school with me&#39;. Even if they somehow did, why 
should I care?&quot; Her mood was quickly turning black.

The two men across from her turned to look at each other, an unreadable 
glance. Then the man, the one who apparently was doing all the talking, 
seem to suddenly switch tracks. &quot;Ah...I see then. Forgive me for 
bringing up a touchy subject.&quot; His winning smile was locked back into 
place, like a million watt bulb shining from those perfect neat teeth. 
Utena was getting that headache again. Firmly she held it back.

The man stood again, and his looked turned a touch more serious. &quot;But 
there was another more business related reason we are here. We had 
planned to offer your manager a photo shoot opportunity with Cultivated 
Elegance magazine.&quot; Judging from the quick glance of confusion from 
Kyouichi, there was no &#39;we&#39; involved with the planning. Utena was highly 
suspicious but couldn&#39;t quite get herself to turn away and leave the 
room. A firm voice inside of her was reminding her how widely popular 
and widespread C.E. publications were. They only took the cream of the 
crop to have an article about in their columns. And a photo shoot? 
Forget it. Average models had no chance. Even Utena, who cared little 
about such things had heard stories of famous actors and aristocracy 
getting turned away. To be offered such a chance to publicize their band 
would be a great opportunity.

Unless...

Utena looked across at the Kiryuu character with a frown. &quot;And just who 
exactly is this offer being made to?&quot; Touga gave a reassuring smile, 
&quot;You and your band mates of course. We would not think of excluding any 
one of you.&quot;

Utena crossed her arms. Her interest was taken, despite her ingrained 
distrust of the playboy sitting across from her. He made her think of a 
gigolo.

&quot;I see...I&#39;m certain our manager would be most appreciative of such a 
fantastic opportunity. I can assure you we would be honored.&quot; Her face 
said otherwise. Then her eyes zeroed in on Saionji, holding his gaze as 
she asked her next question of both of them, &quot;And do the two of you work 
for the magazine?&quot;

A flinch in those purple eyes. Touga answered with a mild shrug, &quot;Not 
precisely. But we are very close friends with the owner.&quot;

The owner?

Utena gave a nod. &quot;I see. Well then, I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll want to discuss 
all the lovely details with my manager. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me...I&#39;m 
late for my...&quot;

The sound of the door opening made all three heads turn to see the male 
secretary from the front desk escorting a woman into the room. The four 
people stared at each other with varying degrees between shock, anger, 
and confusion.

It was Anthy Himemiya standing there. Utena was instantly on her feet 
along with Touga and Saionji who both looked like they had seen a ghost. 
Anthy for her part looked surprised to see them.

Jabbing a finger at Anthy, Utena violently exploded, &quot;YOU! Listen here 
you damn stalker, I swear to all that is unholy, you had better not be 
the one I was set up to meet.&quot;

Anthy shook herself and looked back at the hot glare on Utena&#39;s face. 
Touga&#39;s smile had disappeared at the black vehemence emanating from the 
pink haired woman. Such hatred...at Himemiya? It was uncanny!

&quot;You were late, so I came to see if -&quot;

&quot;No! I don&#39;t even want to hear it. Stay away from me you freak! You 
disgust me! Stay out of my life! STAY AWAY FROM ME!!&quot; Her voice became a 
harsh animalistic roar of fury, and the other three people blanched. Her 
eyes shone hot white silver. Papers that had been neatly stacked on the 
meeting table began to fly about the room as if carried by a wind. 
Except that they were indoors. Then one by one, the fluttering sheets of 
white snapped apart, cut by an invisible blade. And just as suddenly as 
it had happened, it was gone. The papers scattered onto the floor and 
chairs. Shoving her way violently past, Utena knocked Anthy into the 
paneled wall, and slammed the door behind her as she exited.

Saionji was already around the table, to grab her firmly about the 
shoulders, concern evident on his face, &quot;Anthy...Anthy are you alright? 
I...it&#39;s really you!&quot; Silent tears coursed their way down her bronzed 
cheeks. Touga came over and placed a hand on her as well. &quot;Anthy...tell 
us...what is going on?&quot;

The long haired woman managed to gather herself and looked up into the 
matured faces of two men she knew so well. Choking back a sob of 
anguish, Anthy clung to their jackets. &quot;Utena...she...she&#39;s in 
trouble...&quot;
