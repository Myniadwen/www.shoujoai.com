<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 61 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/locket-ch60.html">Back to Part 60</a><pre>        The black haired young woman in her school girl&#39;s
uniform frowned as she lay her katana on the bar,
setting the sword down carefully between all the
candles and skull shaped goblets. &quot;I&#39;m still not happy
about leaving this up here,&quot; Hazuki scowled, her blue
eyes flashing.

       Ryouko just shrugged, her styled blue mane falling
down her leather clad back as she smoothly picked the
sword up and respectfully set it down behind the bar.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she grinned at the young woman, &quot;it&#39;s the
rules.&quot;

       The blonde beside Hazuki smiled, her odd pointed hat
almost looking like a witch&#39;s. Her white blouse barely
contained the swell of her breasts, her tight black
dress hugging her hips. &quot;Besides, Eve may be in this
world,&quot; Ririsu offered cheerfully.

       &quot;Hatsumi,&quot;  Hazuki corrected her.

       &quot;Whichever,&quot; Ririsu shrugged casually. Her eyes lit
up happily as she saw the people swaying together,
&quot;And there&#39;s dancing!&quot; She grabbed Hazuki&#39;s arm and
tugged her.

       &quot;Hey, wait a moment,&quot; Hazuki protested, the taller
woman stumbling after her, the bandage wrapped around
one leg trailing behind.

       &quot;So,&quot; the quiet voice asked, calling Ryouko away from
watching the amusing pair, &quot;how do I look, m&#39;love?&quot;

       Ryouko turned, her eyes widening as she took Princess
Ayeka in. Her Jurai robes had been exchanged for a
daring slinky black dress, cut low in the front and
very, very short. Just the slightest bit of white
marked her skin, giving her an unearthly glow. &quot;Wow,&quot;
Ryouko blinked.

       Ayeka tugged nervously at the short skirt but still
looked pleased. &quot;This is the last time I let Setsuna
help dress me up,&quot; she moved around the bar to snuggle
with Ryouko as she admitted, &quot;she&#39;s a bit more daring
than I am.&quot;

       Ryouko chuckled as she held Ayeka close, &quot;This from
the woman who&#39;s been know to wear a Juraian dominatrix
outfit.&quot;

       &quot;Special circumstances,&quot; Ayeka answered with as much
dignity as she could muster. She looked up at Ryouko,
her eyes suddenly a bit wicked as she purred, &quot;Why, do
I need to dig that costume out, dear?&quot;

       Ryouko just grinned, leaning forward to whisper
something in her ear that made Ayeka blush fiercely.
Looking up she turned to her fellow bartenders who had
moved in to take up the slack, &quot;You mind if I take a
short dancing break?&quot;

       Minagi grinned as she swept by her twin sister, a
beer bottle in both the scarred woman&#39;s hands, &quot;Yeah,
we can manage.&quot; She bent over to grab something, the
matching leather catsuit she wore giving customers
quite the view.

       &quot;Yes, sempai,&quot; Mahoro beamed, her carefully torn
maid&#39;s outfit revealing more of her legs and breasts
than she might normally consider doing.

       Ryouko and Ayeka went around the bar and out to the
dance floor together, the two women sliding close as
they swayed gently with the music. Out in the crowds
many people were dancing, some human while a few quite
clearly were not.

       &quot;You know, I like this visit much better than our
last one here,&quot; Buffy remarked, the butchy looking
blonde leading.

       Willow laughed, the vampiress snugly held in her
tight leather dress. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she agreed, &quot;though I
hadn&#39;t really expected to bring them along, too.&quot;

       Sitting at a table just off of the dance floor two
young women looked around them in a certain amount of
awe. &quot;You know,&quot; Faith commented, &quot;I really didn&#39;t
expect B. and her girl to know about a place like
this.&quot;

       &quot;Neither did I,&quot; Tara admitted, the brown haired
woman looking around her warily.

       &quot;Hello,&quot; May beamed at them, her gothic styled maid&#39;s
uniform hugging her generously proportioned body,
&quot;what can I get you?&quot; She quickly jotted down their
orders and hurried off, long brown mane swinging.

       Tara shook her head as the woman left then quietly
asked, &quot;Is it me or are some of these vampires not in
costume?&quot;

       &quot;According to Hitomi this place is neutral
territory,&quot; Dawn volunteered, the younger girl pushing
her brown hair back nervously.

       &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Faith commented, her boyishly styled
black hair going with her T-shirt and jeans. She
looked across the table, smiling slightly at Tara and
felt a flash of amusement as the woman actually
blushed a bit.

       The black haired woman cut through the crowd to their
table, her pale skin bold and eyes eerily intense. She
looked at Dawn and smiled slightly, &quot;Would you care to
dance?&quot;

       &quot;No!&quot; both Faith and Tara blurted out at the same
time, instantly recognizing a powerful vampire when
they saw one.

       She seemed to take it in good grace, nodding as she
turned to walk away, &quot;My apologies.&quot;

       &quot;Wait,&quot; Dawn spoke up, glaring over at Faith and Tara
before gently asking the mysterious girl, &quot;what&#39;s your
name?&quot;

       &quot;Saya,&quot; the vampiress answered softly.

       &quot;I&#39;d love to dance with you,&quot; Dawn got up, her dress
swirling around her, &quot;Saya.&quot;

       As the two moved off into the dancers Faith thumped
her head down on the table as she moaned out, &quot;B is
gonna kill us.&quot;

       &quot;Then let&#39;s get out there and keep an eye on them,&quot;
Tara got up, offering her hand to Faith and following
the two out onto the dance floor.

       Arisugawa Juri smiled as she looked over the crowd,
the bar packed once again with people  having a good
time. &#39;We&#39;re going to need another full time server,&#39;
Juri noted as the orange haired athlete sipped from a
red tinted ginger ale, the tight red gown clinging to
her body, &#39;Excel and the others haven&#39;t actually
complained yet, but they&#39;re being run ragged some
nights.&#39;

       &quot;Lost in thought?&quot; the familiar voice purred from
behind Juri.

       &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting...,&quot; Juri started to say only to
trail off in surprise. Setsuna Meiou looked like she
had raided Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s closet, or at least
Haruka&#39;s. The midnight black suit hugged her gorgeous
body, the pants clinging to her hips while the
matching coat barely contained the swell of her
breasts. Ruby lips and black hair suited her pale
coloring, the image of a vampire lady.

       &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Setsuna purred impishly as she
asked, &quot;Could you use a damp cloth on the back of the
neck or something?&quot;

       &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Juri agreed, stepping forward to
pull her lover close for a kiss. She chuckled softly,
&quot;I hope you and Michiru didn&#39;t talk poor Haruka into a
dress.&quot;

       Setsuna snickered softly, &quot;We&#39;re not quite that
cruel, but....&quot;

       Haruka and Michiru reached them then and Juri blinked
in honest surprise. The snow white suit that Haruka
wore almost glowed as the sandy haired woman moved
through the shadows of the bar while Michiru was
dressed in a matching black suit, the small green
haired woman holding on to her lover&#39;s arm
possessively.

       &quot;Very nice,&quot; Juri grinned, &quot;does this mean we&#39;ll be
seeing you two in suits more often?&quot;

       &quot;Oh, occasionally,&quot; Michiru laughed.

       Haruka nodded thoughtfully, &quot;It does make a nice
change of pace.&quot;

       &quot;Oh, where oh where can my baby be,
        The Lord took her away from me
       She&#39;s gone to heaven so I&#39;ve got to be good
       So I can see my baby when I leave this world.&quot;

       Mihoshi sang with surprising beauty up on the stage,
the dusky skinned blonde looking oddly like a cute
flight attendant in her Galaxy Police uniform. She
finished with a sad smile before softly adding, &quot;I
look forward to seeing you again, Kiyone.&quot;
