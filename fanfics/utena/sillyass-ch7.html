<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 7 of 21)</h1>

<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Lina Inverse&#39;s eyes widened as she saw the tall blonde politely making 
her way through the crowd. Her aristocratic stance seemed to cause the 
crowd to give way for her, and in moments she was standing right in 
front of them.

&quot;Lina-sama,&quot; Filla said happily, &quot;it&#39;s so good to see you!&quot;

Naga looked down at Lina with a frown, &quot;Who&#39;s this, darling?&quot;

Filla frowned, reaching out to grasp Lina&#39;s arm. &quot;What do you mean, 
she&#39;s my darling!&quot; Filla protested to her angrily.

Both beautiful young women glared at each other furiously, lightning 
flashing between them. Naga raised her hands, ice swirling about them, 
while Filla glowed golden, and the silhouette of a dragon appeared 
around her.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Lina whimpered, and dove out of the way...

&quot;Well, things just sort of went down hill from there,&quot; Lina finished 
her explanation, sitting outside the medical office where Filla and 
Naga were both being treated for their various injuries by the 
school&#39;s temporary nurse.

Student Council member Arisugawa Juri looked down at her with a 
certain amount of sympathy. &quot;Look I can certainly understand love 
triangles, I&#39;ve been in the middle of them myself. But Lina, your two 
paramours destroyed two classrooms and the entire library wing! You&#39;ve 
got to try and resolve this!&quot; she said a bit desperately.

The short redhead nodded mournfully. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do,&quot; Lina 
sighed, rising to her feet. &quot;See you,&quot; she waved over her shoulder 
before she took a deep breath and walked into the silent nurse&#39;s 
office.

Naga the White Serpent lay on one bed, Filla on the other, both having 
a few bandages neatly placed over the worst of their various cuts and 
bruises. They were both obviously ignoring each other. Shinohara 
Wakaba stood in the middle, dressed up as a nurse, white uniform, cap 
and all the accessories.

&quot;Since when do you have medical training?&quot; Lina asked the great genki 
one in surprise.

&quot;Nobody else wants the job,&quot; Wakaba said with a shrug, &quot;and I do look 
good dressed in the uniform. Well, I&#39;ll leave you alone now.&quot; She 
walked out of the office to find out what Juri thought of the nurse&#39;s 
uniform on her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; a blushing Lina started, looked at the both of them a bit 
guiltily. She turned to Filla, &quot;Naga was my first lover, we adventured 
together for a while, but I lost touch with her years ago.&quot; She looked 
over at Naga, &quot;Filla and I became involved when I and my companions 
adventured with her in the outer world.&quot;

Filla looked over at Naga a bit ruefully, &quot;It seems we both have some 
claim on her, then.&quot; She sighed, produced a fresh cup of tea from 
seemingly thin air and sipped at it, a thoughtful expression on her 
face.

Naga nodded mournfully in agreement, then looked over at Lina 
considering. &quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; she asked her quietly.

Lina found herself under both Naga&#39;s and Filla&#39;s piercing gazes. She 
sighed, &quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; She smiled at Naga, 
&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever got over you, you know. But..&quot; she gazed at 
Filla, &quot;the dragon lady has a place in my heart too.&quot;

Filla sipped daintily at her tea. &quot;I think I may have a solution to 
our little problem,&quot; she said with a sigh. She looked up to meet their 
enquiring gazes, &quot;You&#39;re not going to like it, though. It&#39;s a ancient 
custom of my people that applies to situations like this,&quot; and with 
that she bent over to whisper in their ears.

&quot;No way,&quot; Lina whispered, her eyes growing wide.

Naga nodded thoughtfully, &quot;You know, it might just work.&quot; She gazed at 
Filla thoughtfully, adding &quot;If we can manage to get along.&quot;

Filla smiled a bit at Naga, &quot;I think we&#39;ll manage.&quot;

It only took a few days to make the necessary arrangements, as much of 
the school body were willing to pitch in. The clubs were also helpful, 
especially the Yuri and Yaoi club. Finally, they were ready to get 
going.

&quot;By the ancient custom of the golden dragons,&quot; Filla officiated, &quot;when 
two love one other there are two options. The path of war, and the 
path of peace. Naga and I have chosen the path of peace.&quot;

Naga stepped up, &quot;I agree to share Lina Inverse with my co-wife, 
Filla.&quot;

&quot;And I Filla, do agree to share Lina Inverse with my co-wife, Naga the 
White Serpent,&quot; Filla declared confidently.

&quot;Don&#39;t I get any say in this?&quot; a desperate sounding Lina pleaded, 
bound head to foot in strong ropes.

&quot;No,&quot; her two new co-wives said to her simultaneously. </pre>
