<h1>A Special Case (part 1 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The moment she walked into the office, every clich&eacute; ever written about 
women and private eyes popped into my head. But none of them are true. 
I had no idea she&#146;d be trouble, and her legs, while nice, weren&#146;t 
better than average. Her hair was rolled into a bun-like hairstyle, 
and pinned, so I had no idea how long it was. In fact, she looked more 
like an office lady than a femme fatale.

I gestured her to a chair and nodded at my receptionist, a nice 
college student who was working her way through a degree in criminal 
investigation. I sat down behind my desk smiling reassuringly, and 
gave her my &quot;break the ice and give the client a moment to orient&quot; rap 
&#150; mostly background about who I am, what I do&#133;you know, disposable 
information.

She smiled, no beamed, at me, and I found that I couldn&#146;t read 
anything in her face. Not a thing. I pride myself on being pretty good 
with reading faces &#150; it&#146;s part of the skill set for the job &#150; and it 
was a bit unnerving to find so blank a canvas. Her eyes sparkled with 
a friendly light, but behind that everything was guarded. Like 
visiting the Diet. You can see what they want you to see, but nothing 
more.

When I finished my spiel, she introduced herself as Himemiya Anshi, 
formerly of Houou, now living in Tokyo. She gave no occupation and I 
didn&#146;t press for one. She could have been a madam for all I knew. I 
didn&#146;t want to know. Something was very strange about her behavior and 
it bothered me quite a bit until I put my finger on it. She was here 
in my office and obviously wanted me to do work for her &#150; then how 
come she wasn&#146;t upset, nervous, or at least a little worried? *No one* 
came here without worries. That&#146;s why you hire a private investigator, 
after all. This, combined with her eyes, pinged me immediately. There 
was something wrong here and I knew it. But she didn&#146;t smell dirty. I 
decided to play along and see if I could figure out what was up.

&quot;So,&quot; I came around and sat on the edge of my desk, giving me the 
advantage of height over her, &quot;What is it that I can help you with, 
Miss Himemiya?&quot; I smiled at her, but left my eyes guarded too &#150; she 
wasn&#146;t the only one who could do that. A few years of police training 
teaches you how to do that, sometimes obviously, sometimes not. Her 
eyes widened, just a little, showing she had noticed. Good. 

&quot;I am sorry to be such a bother,&quot; I waved away the traditional 
excuses, and she continued, &quot;I am looking for someone. I want you to 
find her.&quot; She looked down into the little clutch purse she held and 
pulled out a photograph. I took it but didn&#146;t look at it. Not yet. I 
wanted to know more. I waited until she began speaking again.

&quot;In case you&#146;re worried, there&#146;s nothing strange about this request. 
It&#146;s not illegal, or even questionable. This woman is an 
old&#133;schoolmate. We parted several years ago, and I&#146;d like to find her. 
Can you help me?&quot;

I noticed the hesitation, the use of &quot;parted.&quot; Old lover, I assumed, 
or maybe close to it. That would explain why she was so guarded. But 
for some reason, that didn&#146;t wash. There was something she wasn&#146;t 
telling me. One look into her face told me that she wasn&#146;t going to 
tell me, either, and that she could wait as long as I could. I took 
the opportunity to look at the photo.

It was an amateur deal - a girl, pink-haired, in a school uniform of a 
sort. She stood next to another girl, obviously my Miss Himemiya. They 
both smiled, but where my client had that same polite, carefully empty 
smile, her companion&#146;s face was open, glossy with happiness and youth. 
Blue eyes shone from the photo and I could feel the girl&#146;s charisma, 
sensing it in the way she waved at the camera, the arm around Miss 
Himemiya&#146;s slim form. I looked up.

&quot;How many years ago?&quot; I asked. 

My client shrugged slightly. &quot;Almost ten now.&quot; I looked back down at 
the photo. That made the missing girl about my age. I wondered&#133;

&quot;Why&#146;d you wait so long to look for her?&quot; Still looking at the 
picture. There was something about that face&#133;something I couldn&#146;t put 
my finger on.

&quot;I haven&#146;t. I began looking for her as soon as we&#133;graduated.&quot; Again, I 
noticed the hesitation. I looked up again, my eyes slightly narrowed. 
Miss Himemiya noticed immediately and her smile became more placatory, 
her voice soothing. &quot;And no, our school has no record of her current 
whereabouts. In fact, &quot;and she sighed slightly, &quot;the school has 
undergone quite a few changes since we were there. I&#146;m not sure if any 
of their records would be of help anymore.&quot; Something slipped in her 
guard, and I saw a moment of genuine pain pass over her face. I filed 
it away for future use &#150; school was not a happy time. For whom? Miss 
Himemiya, or her lost &quot;friend?&quot;

I gave an exaggerated sigh. &quot;The truth is, Miss Himemiya, I&#146;m not sure 
I can help you here. If you&#146;ve been looking for ten years&#133;&quot; The real 
truth was, I&#146;d have taken this case for free. Not to find her, so much 
as find out what I wasn&#146;t being told. That&#146;s where the real 
investigative work comes in&#133;what was the real story behind those 
guarded green eyes? &quot;Have you been to another investigator?&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;No. I waited until I had followed every lead I 
could. They led me here&#133;to Kyoto. That was about a year ago. Now&#133;well, 
you were recommended to me. In fact, you are highly spoken of.&quot; Her 
smile, again, and I found myself smiling back. No great beauty 
perhaps, but this woman&#146;s charm was unmistakable.

&quot;Spoken of?&quot; I noticed that I was being exceptionally terse and 
decided to use that as a weapon. Maybe she&#146;d believe that I didn&#146;t 
want the job&#133;maybe she&#146;d tell me more. Maybe she&#146;d stay here and we 
could chat for a while&#133;

&quot;By the police. Especially Officer Eishin. He told me that you had 
been a member of their force&#133;&quot; She paused and turned to look out the 
window. I hoped that my embarrassment didn&#146;t show on my face. Tobei 
and I had been good friends, then more, and now we were good friends 
again. It worked better this way. When I was a cop, he would get 
terribly worried about me and try to smother me. It wasn&#146;t good for 
either of us. By the time I left the force, we had already split, but 
he was a good guy and his new wife was very sweet. I had dinner at 
their place once a month; they came over mine about the same. I looked 
down at the picture in my hand, as my client turned back to face me.

There was a long silence until, at last, I looked up and met her eyes. 
All wards were in place, for both of us. 

&quot;Will you take the case?&quot; She asked simply. No tears, not 
importuning&#133;I had the impression she already knew my answer.

I shrugged. &quot;Yes. Sure.&quot; And I launched into my prepared speech on 
fees and expenses. Without blinking, she reached into her purse, and 
pulled out a checkbook. Scribbling for a moment, she handed me a 
check, and a small folded wad of bills. 

&quot;The check will cover your expenses when you travel. The cash is for 
right now. I expect you&#146;ll want to start right away.&quot; Her voice was 
sweet and gentle, but there was humor underneath it. I hesitated to 
take the money, feeling the universe about to laugh at my expense, but 
then, what else did I have to do? I shrugged once again and took the 
money with both hands, bowing formally. 

My client laughed at that, and pulling away, she bowed herself. &quot;I&#146;ll 
expect a daily report from you &#150; unless you&#146;re away. Then just let me 
know when you come back. I&#146;ll have the portfolio of information I&#146;ve 
collected sent to you today.&quot; That was the second time she referred to 
me traveling. I wondered where I was being sent.

&quot;I&#146;ll call you at&#133;&quot; I checked for a phone number on her check and 
repeated it to her. She nodded, then turned around crisply, stopped at 
the door, bowed once more to me, then left. The office felt much 
changed after she was gone. Slightly dingier, as if the color had 
leeched out of the paintings on the wall. I sat in my chair and 
sighed. This was going to be some case &#150; I could already feel it. I 
sighed again and wondered just who I was going to find at the end of 
all this.
