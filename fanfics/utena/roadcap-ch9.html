<h1>The Road to the Capital (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/roadcap-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        The sun rose over the royal city, light shining through the 
windows of a room over in the guard&#39;s quarters. The soft glow swept over 
everything in the room, especially on the two laying there in the small 
bed. Nanami let her arms tighten a bit around the gently slumbering 
Keiko, gazing down at the woman cradled there.

        &#39;I should get up soon,&#39; Nanami thought, her golden hair falling 
around her, &#39;but I don&#39;t want to.&#39; Last night had been wonderful, the 
two spending hours talking, then... she blushed.

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Keiko smiled dreamily, her brown hair falling 
into her eyes. She snuggled closer, &quot;It&#39;s been,.. a long time.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Nanami agreed. She hesitated, considering what she 
was going to say, &quot;I haven&#39;t been entirely chaste, though.&quot;

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t expect you to be,&quot; Keiko agreed. Her voice became 
mildly dangerous, &quot;You aren&#39;t seeing anyone else now, are you?&quot;

        Nanami chuckled, reaching out to toy with Keiko&#39;s hair, &quot;Not for 
a long time. I&#39;ve known desire, but without love... it&#39;s just not 
enough.&quot;

        &quot;For me, as well,&quot; Keiko agreed, relaxing a bit. She reached out 
to stroke the cheek, looking into those expressive eyes, &quot;I never 
stopped loving you, even when I left here.&quot;

        &quot;I love you, too,&quot; Nanami agreed. She reached out, gently 
stroking along a tanned cheek, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;

        Keiko kissed that hand gently, cradling it in her own. She held 
that hand, squeezing gently as she looked over at Nanami, mouth open to 
speak...

        ... when a loud disturbance came from the hall just outside. 
Nanami cursed both fluently and creatively as someone hammered on her 
door, then the woman slipped out of bed. &quot;Sorry, love,&quot; her eyes 
glittered angrily as she pulled on a shirt, &quot;I have to go kill whomever 
interrupted us.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; the guard was frantic, then went bone pale as he saw 
the look on his commander&#39;s face. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; he took a half step 
backwards.

        Keiko took pity on the poor boy and as she was getting dressed 
behind the relative safety of the door asked, &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;

        &quot;Another black rose,&quot; the man stammered out greatfully.

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Nanami scowled, &quot;I&#39;ll be there in a moment.&quot; She slammed 
the door shut then ran to grab the rest of her clothes.

        &quot;Wonder who was entranced this time?&quot; Keiko asked, sitting on 
the bed as she roughly pulled her leather boots on, matching the plain 
brown pants she wore.

        Nanami yanked her own uniform pants up, then pulled the matching 
overcoast on over her white shirt. &quot;If he follows his existing pattern,&quot; 
Nanami belted her sword around her waist, &quot;he&#39;ll strike through one of 
my guards or the Princess&#39; companions.&quot;

        &quot;Probably,&quot; Keiko got to her feet as the two headed out into the 
hallway and hurried to the princess&#39; rooms. The sounds of a duel rang 
out, and her eyes widened, &quot;The battle continues?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Nanami managed once they saw the combatants.

        Blood ran down Utena&#39;s cheek, a sword strike having slipped by 
her guard. Her pink hair was stuck to her head with sweat, and her 
breath came faster than normal. Standing across from her Kaoru Miki 
raised his blade thoughtfully, his eyes oddly glazed. The blue haired 
man wore a black rose in his pocket, just like all the others.

        Utena raised her sword, meeting those dark eyes as she said, 
&quot;Miki, don&#39;t do this. You don&#39;t want to hurt Anthy, I know it.&quot;

        &quot;Everyone around you is hurt,&quot; Miki murmured, &quot;innocents like 
Wakaba.&quot; His eyes flashed, &quot;You have to pay!&quot;

        The swords flashed, the blades ringing as they came together, 
Back and forth they fought, two different styles from very different 
fighters. Miki fought with skill, finesse, a technical fighter, while 
Utena applied all the skills she had won on a battlefield.

        &quot;They&#39;re too evenly matched,&quot; Nanami murmured, watching them 
intently.

        &quot;Miki&#39;s a quiet man, so he got challenged for duels when he 
first arrived at the princess&#39; court,&quot; Keiko said softly, &quot;he never 
lost, and the challenges stopped pretty quickly.&quot;

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Nanami muttered again. She stepped forward, watching the 
fight continue as the two swordsmen fought on. She drew her sword, 
waited for the right moment and slammed the hilt of her sword into the 
back of Miki&#39;s head.

        &quot;Oog?&quot; Miki staggered, his expression dazed.

        Utena moved instantly, taking advantage of the moment of 
distraction to slice across the black rose, sending the petals 
scattering to the wind. Miki wavered, his eyes rolled up in his head and 
he dropped to the floor, unconscious.

        Utena sheathed her sword, looking up at Nanami to say, &quot;That 
wasn&#39;t very honorable.&quot;

        Nanami slid her own sword away and shrugged slightly. &quot;I&#39;m not 
feeling particularly honorable right now,&quot; she sighed. She looked 
around, frowning when she didn&#39;t see Anthy in the chamber, &quot;Is the 
princess all right?&quot;

        &quot;I had Juri and Shiori get her out when I saw who it was,&quot; Utena 
knelt down beside Miki. The blue haired boy seemed fine, other than 
being out cold. She got up and walked over to open up the other door, 
&quot;Anthy, he&#39;s down.&quot;

        Anthy strode in, gazing with gentle concern where Miki lay so 
still. &quot;Will he be all right?&quot; she asked Utena worriedly.

        &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Shiori pushed past Anthy, kneeling down at Miki&#39;s 
side. She began to chant, energy flowing around her hands as she worked.

        &quot;What is...?&quot; Keiko looked over at Juri in surprise.

        &quot;Shiori studied the scrolls on Mikage&#39;s history and magics last 
night,&quot; Juri said as she watched her violet haired lover worriedly, &quot;she 
thinks she made a break through.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Utena said softly, feeling an odd electricity in 
the air, &quot;I&#39;m getting very tired of having an enemy that we can&#39;t even 
find.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve got it,&quot; Shiori exclaimed, then trailed off weakly, &quot;I... 
oh, no.&quot;

        Nanami drew her sword and thrust Keiko behind her as she gazed 
at the flickering image of the magician Mikage. His attention was 
focused on Shiori, and dark power seemed to swirl around him. Juri ran 
forward only to freeze under a single glance.

        &quot;You are more than I expected, little one,&quot; Mikage mused.

        &quot;Get out of here,&quot; Anthy drew herself up, summoning her most 
royal manner. She could feel her blood run cold as Mikage looked at her, 
but she made herself meet his gaze.

        &quot;You are brave, little princess,&quot; Mikage smiled coldly, &quot;but I 
have not come for you today.&quot; With that he turned back to Shiori...

        &quot;No!&quot; Utena cried out, charging forward. The signet ring she 
still wore, the gift of the Sword of Dios shone, and unconsciously she 
called out for aide.

        And was answered.

        The Sword of Dios, still glowing red-hot from the forge appeared 
in mid-air and dropped down into her open hands. Utena cried out in pain 
as her flesh was burned, but still she swung, the mystical sword passing 
through Mikage&#39;s image and banishing him in a flare of light.

        &quot;UTENA!&quot; Anthy ran to Utena&#39;s side as the sword clattered to the 
ground, cradling her love&#39;s badly burned hands in her own.

        &quot;Get the healers,&quot; Juri cried as she helped Shiori up to her 
feet.

        &quot;Not alone,&quot; Nanami growled as Keiko was about to leave, both of 
them running from the room together.

        Utena shuddered, her eyes firmly shut, the smell of burning 
flesh still hanging in the air. With a gasp she asked, &quot;Can you find 
him?&quot;

        Shiori nodded as she firmly answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; and with that Utena fainted.</pre>
