<a href="../utena/capsaga-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Keiko sighed softly, sitting down at the side of the gurgling 
fountain. She was careful to shift her long brown braid aside, then 
looked up at the still standing Nanami and smiled slightly, &quot;You look 
quite fearsome standing there, Commander. Sit, please.&quot;

        &quot;Fearsome?&quot; Nanami smiled a bit sadly as the blonde sat down 
beside her, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought I&#39;d changed all that much.&quot;

        Keiko looked over at Nanami, &quot;The aura of command suits you, I 
think.&quot;

        Nanami nodded, looking away from Keiko nervously as she softly 
said, &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for a better way to say this, but I can&#39;t 
seem to find the right words.&quot; A little breath, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, for how 
I acted back then.&quot;

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t exactly blameless, when we parted,&quot; Keiko reminded 
her gently.

        Nanami closed her eyes moment, remembering that dark night, 
two young women standing in this very courtyard so many years ago. 
Keiko had been a very different girl then, a proper daughter of a 
noble family, a family that was plainly horrified by her... liaison 
with the rebellious Nanami. They had ordered their youngest daughter 
away from the castle and the young hellion&#39;s dangerous influence, and 
Keiko had meekly agreed.

        &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have pressed you the way I did,&quot; Nanami sighed in 
memory. She had argued that Keiko should defy her family, swiftly 
reducing her lover to tears.

        &quot;And I should have had the nerve to stand up to my father,&quot; 
Keiko said softly. &quot;But I never did, not until I was out of his reach 
at least.&quot;

        A slight smile tugged on Nanami&#39;s lips as she quietly said, &quot;I 
was certainly startled when I first saw you following Anthy&#39;s party 
into the castle gates.&quot; A bit of a grin, &quot;I honestly thought that my 
eyes were deceiving me.&quot;

        &quot;And I didn&#39;t expect the rebel street duelist to become the 
commander of the castle guard,&quot; Keiko said. She paused, &quot;But I wasn&#39;t 
too surprised to see you here, Nanami. I tried to keep track of you, 
down through the years.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Nanami looked away from her, feeling suddenly 
disconcerted. The brown haired woman was even more beautiful than she 
had once been, having grown into a graceful maturity. The caged bird 
of many years past had seemingly grown into a falcon, proud and free.

        &quot;I was such a fool,&quot; Keiko looked at Nanami, a few tears 
glistening in her eyes, &quot;and I spent many a night wishing I had 
accepted your offer and stayed.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Nanami agreed softly.

        Keiko gently slid her fingers into Nanami&#39;s before she quietly 
asked her, &quot;Would you consider giving this fool another chance?&quot;

        Nanami drew Keiko&#39;s hand to her lips, gently kissing the back. 
&quot;Then you can call me a fool as well,&quot; Nanami said to her softly, &quot;for 
I would always give you a second chance.&quot;

        The tears slid free, flowing down Keiko&#39;s cheeks, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 
She leaned forward, pressing her lips to Nanami&#39;s own, the fountain 
gurgling behind them.

        Later that night, in another part of the castle, a restless 
figure tried to sleep deeply, that rest seemingly escaping her. &quot;She 
enchants them all,&quot; Mikage softly murmured, the black rose he placed 
there opening up the sleeping mind to his influence. &quot;She weaves 
magics about them, and they will notice no other,&quot; a twisted smile.

        &quot;You have to make her pay for stealing away all of that love,&quot; 
Mikage finished, his short pink hair flowing about his face, &quot;pay 
dearly.&quot; With that, he simply disappeared.

        Utena watched the dress fitting going on, Anthy being wreathed 
in the formal reds of the coronation ceremony. They were making steady 
progress, and it looked like Anthy would be ready for the ceremony 
coming in only a few days.

        Utena felt a bit of guilty relief that her own garb for the 
coronation was going to be so much simpler. As a soldier in the royal 
service all she was going to have to wear was her formal uniform, a 
bit uncomfortable but not all that bad, considering.

        &quot;You can at least try to hide that smile, Utena,&quot; Anthy said 
with a little smile of her own.

        &quot;Sorry, love,&quot; Utena chuckled softly. She got up from her seat 
to gaze at the woman embraced in bolts of fabric and softly added, 
&quot;You look lovely.&quot;

        A bit of red appeared on Anthy&#39;s cheeks. &quot;You always seem to 
know the right thing to say, m&#39;love,&quot; she said softly, looking at 
Utena with an odd kind of wonder.

        Being careful not to disturb the busy seamstresses Utena 
reached out to gently take Anthy&#39;s hand. &quot;With you, it&#39;s easy,&quot; Utena 
said softly.

        She came in the front door, her curly hair bouncing as she 
walked forward with an odd sense of purpose in her stride. She ignored 
all of the busy courtiers, the seamstresses, it seemed she was 
completely focused on one thing only.

        &quot;Wakaba,&quot; Anthy looked up to smile cheerfully at her personal 
maid.

        Utena saw the black rose on the girl&#39;s breast and quickly 
shoved Anthy backwards, just in time to avoid a deadly sweep of a 
wicked looking knife. The seamstresses screamed, courtiers scattered, 
and the room descended into chaos. Another sweep as Utena put herself 
right between Wakaba and her lover, reaching at her side for her 
sword...

        ... only to see it sitting by her chair. &quot;Anthy!&quot; Utena cried 
out, jerking back to avoid a cut to her face, seeing strands of her 
pink hair falling in front of her eyes towards the floor.

        Anthy scrambled, her legs tangled in bolts of cloth, but 
grabbed at the sword. &quot;Here,&quot; she cried, pitching it towards where 
Utena stood.

        Utena caught it and drew the blade smoothly, parrying a cut 
that likely would have blinded her. &#39;I never realized she was this 
good a knife fighter,&#39; she noted, blocking another strike. &quot;Why are 
you doing this?&quot; she cried.

        &quot;Miki,&quot; Wakaba snarled, &quot;all he speaks of is the princess! All 
he sees is her face, all he hears is her voice...&quot; She shook her head, 
a few tears shining on her cheeks, &quot;The only way he&#39;ll ever be able to 
see me if she is gone!&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; Utena started.

        Utena cried out in pain as her cheek was sliced, avoiding a 
deeper cut only by reflex. &quot;Step aside,&quot; Wakaba held her knife ready, 
clearly willing to use it, &quot;or pay the consequences.&quot;

        &quot;Fine,&quot; Utena moved, taking the hilt she still held in one 
hand and jabbing the startled girl right in the stomach. Taking 
advantage of a weakness in her guard Utena struck, sending the petals 
of the black rose spiraling to the floor.

        &quot;Wakaba!&quot; Anthy cried out as the girl collapsed.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t hurt her,&quot; Utena reached up to check the cut to her 
face before softly adding, &quot;well, not too much, anyway.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; Anthy reached up to check on her lover, not 
noticing the bolts of fabric that were covering her had finally come 
loose. Without a sound, they fluttered to the ground, leaving her 
entirely in the nude.

        There was a sudden hammering on the main doors, then it just 
burst open, a small group rushing inside, Nanami leading the charge. 
&quot;We heard a disturbance..&quot; she started to say only to trail off, 
blushing quite furiously.

        &quot;Eep!&quot; Anthy&#39;s face flamed, and Utena turned herself to 
provide her love some cover.

        &quot;Black rose,&quot; Shiori pointed to where the petals still 
lingered. The purple haired girl gave Juri a scolding look, &quot;Get your 
thoughts out of the privy, please.&quot;

        Wakaba groaned softly, distracting them from Juri&#39;s blushing 
reply. The brown haired girl sat up, looking about in honest 
confusion, &quot;What happened? Where am I?&quot;

        &quot;Shiori?&quot; Juri asked her lover softly.

        Shiori gazed at Wakaba intently, &quot;It seems the enchantment is 
gone.&quot;

        Nanami offered Wakaba a hand, giving the smaller woman an 
intent look, but there was no sign of malice left in the cutely 
befuddled young woman. &quot;You don&#39;t remember anything?&quot; Nanami asked her 
softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Wakaba said impatiently, &quot;what happened?&quot;

        &quot;That was a little too close,&quot; Utena murmured, pulling a 
larger piece around Anthy as a sort of improvised cloak.

        Anthy&#39;s eyes glittered angrily, &quot;Now he strikes at my 
friends.&quot; She looked up at Utena, &quot;I want him stopped, Utena. Before 
anyone else is harmed.&quot;

        Utena tightened her hands on her lover&#39;s shoulders, &quot;I&#39;ll do 
my best.&quot;
