<h1>Those Obnoxious Ohtori! (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The strong fall breeze ruffled her hair, so Kozue reached up and 
pushed her windblown, wavy blue hair away from her face. She wanted it 
out of her eyes as she gazed up into the sky with a certain amount of 
amusement.

&quot;Now there&#39;s something you don&#39;t see everyday,&quot; she remarked to no one 
in particular, as the UFO hung there steadily in the air above Ohtori.

It didn&#39;t look real, more like a bad special effect from a b-movie. It 
was saucer shaped, with blinking lights spaced out along it&#39;s rim, and 
big, round windows dotted along the top. Kozue would have thought it 
was a publicity stunt for some cheesey film, but there was no way it 
could be hovering unsupported in the open air like that! She even 
looked around for a crane of some kind, but no luck.

A small hatch popped opened on the top, and a young woman stuck her 
head out to ask Kozue crossly, &quot;Excuse me, but could you direct me to 
Tokyo, please?&quot;

She was dark hared, Kozue could tell that much, though she could see 
there were some odd colors mixed in with it, streaks of red and blue. 
Kozue also thought she looked sort of cute, but at that distance it 
was a bit hard to tell.

She tried to shout out the directions, but the strong wind seemed to 
pull Kozue&#39;s words from the air before they could reach the girl. The 
strange girl impatiently climbed out on top of the saucer, and Kozue 
sweatdropped at the sight of the girls costume! She had on a small 
bikini top and bottoms, boots and that was all. Strangely, they were 
all done in what looked like tiger fur!

She grew tired of trying to hear Kozue&#39;s shouts over the breeze, so 
she rose up into the air from the top of the saucer and began to fly 
down to the ground. Kozue gaped at her, as she descended towards her 
smoothly. Smoothly, that is, until she hit the strong winds between 
the saucer and the ground. She twisted, turned, then finally just lost 
control, plummeting towards Kozue!

&quot;Ooof!&quot; Kozue yelled, sprawling on the ground with the tiger-girl 
stretched out there on top of her. Kozue blushed as the girl&#39;s face 
was pressed right up against her breasts! She firmly grasped the 
girl&#39;s head, but then faltered a moment as she felt the smakll. cone 
shapped horns on each side of the pretty girl&#39;s head! She pulled the 
girl up to her feet, then tried to revive her.

&quot;What happened?&quot; the newly awakened young woman asked Kozue slowly, as 
she looked admiringly at her. Kozue explained, and then the girl 
gasped softly. &quot;Did you... touch my horns?&quot; she asked her, blushing a 
little bit. Then she waited there, anxious for Kozue&#39;s answer.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; a slightly confused Kozue answered, and then the girl 
blushed a bit harder, frowning a little.

&quot;What is your name, please?&quot; she asked Kozue in a firm tone of voice 
as she gazed intently into her eyes.

&quot;Kozue Kaoru,&quot; the blue hared girl answered with a small frown. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with touching your horns?&quot;

&quot;My name is Lum,&quot; she said, smiling, &quot;and by our ancient Oni customs, 
if you touch the horns of an Oni, we are engaged!&quot; She then leaned 
over, and gently but firmly kissed the very stunned looking Kozue.

Lum settled back on her feet, and Kozue sat there, looked at Lum 
blankly for a moment. Then, like a freshly cut tree, she just fell 
right over in a dead faint.

&quot;Darling!&quot; Lum cried out worriedly, kneeling down beside her and 
frantically shakling the out cold Kozue. </pre>
