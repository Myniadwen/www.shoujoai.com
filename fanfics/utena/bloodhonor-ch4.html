<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Anthy waited patiently out in the dim hallway, calmly leaning up 
against the wall as she watched the sun slowly set outside the nearby 
window. The last of the light finally faded, and from inside the room 
she heard a voice call out to her clearly, &quot;Come in, Anthy.&quot;

She pushed the door open, seeing Utena sitting on the edge of the bed. 
Strangely, there were no sheets or blankets, the mattress totally 
bare, and the old bed seemed to have a redish stain right I the 
middle. She looked up, her robin&#39;s blue eyes seemingly haunted by 
something.

&quot;You&#39;re here early tonight,&quot; Utena said to her softly, taking a damp 
cloth from a wash basin right beside her bed and then beginning to 
clean her naked body off. She moved so sensuously, her long, lean body 
turning in the dim light, and Anthy felt her breath catch in her 
throat.

Rather hoarsely Anthy managed to get out, &quot;Kiryuu Touga seems to have 
killed again.&quot;

Utena stiffened, carefully putting the cloth down. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she said 
softly, finishing with a snarled out, &quot;I should have got him when I 
had the chance!&quot; She strode over to her closet, her body still damp, 
and pulled out a school uniform. Pulling it on roughly, she demanded 
of Anthy, &quot;Do you know where he&#39;s been hiding?&quot;

&quot;The Observatory, I think,&quot; Anthy answered her softly, looking at the 
furious Utena rather warily. She reached into her pocket and grasped a 
stake in her hand, hoping that the bloodlust had not suddenly taken 
Utena over.

Utena saw the concern in Anthy&#39;s eyes, and visibly worked to try and 
calm herself down. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to frighten you,&quot; Utena said to her 
softly, &quot;you see, I had a chance to finish him off earlier, but he 
managed to escape me.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Anthy said to her quietly in return, &quot;but don&#39;t let 
your fury get the best of you. You&#39;re better than that, I think.&quot;

Utena smiled grimly, &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

Anthy extended a piece of paper, &quot;He left this.&quot;

&quot;Tenjou Utena,&quot; it read in elegantly written script, &quot;Stop me if you 
can.&quot; And underneath it was signed simply, &quot;Kiryuu Touga.&quot; Utena read 
it through once, then again, the expression on her face strangely 
blank.

&quot;It was a young woman that was found?&quot; she asked her softly. Anthy 
looked surprised, so Utena asked the question again, &quot;The body, it was 
a young woman?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Anthy nodded, and asked her, &quot;how did you know?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just his style,&quot; Utena said, crumpling the note up in her hand. 
She walked over and looked out the window, &quot;I&#39;m going after him 
tonight.&quot; To Anthy&#39;s shock, she simply let herself fall right out of 
the window before dropping down like a cat to the ground below her.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t face him alone!&quot; Anthy yelled out, but Utena was simply 
gone from her sight. Swearing softly under her breath, Anthy rushed 
out of the room intoi the hallway, down the old stairs, and then out 
of the building after her.

Utena let her body fall, then with a simple twist she landed smoothly 
on her feet. Anthy yelled something to her, but Utena didn&#39;t hear. She 
loped across the grounds with inhuman speed. focused on one thing 
only.

The Observatory was a wreck, abandoned by all of those who had any 
sense in this vampire haunted place. This was where Akio had changed 
the student council into vampires, where debauched orgies of death and 
violence had taken place. This was where Utena&#39;s life had ended, and 
then in a spurt of Akio&#39;s foul blood had begun again...

Utena felt her rage rising up, and she fought to hold it back. She 
grasped the rotting door in her hands and with a single surge of 
unearthly strength tore it from it&#39;s moorings. She stepped inside, and 
was almost instantly set upon!

Saionji gibbered and howled, his claw like hands raking at her face. 
Utena was slammed to the ground, his fetid breath turning her stomach 
as she tried to fight free. With his fangs he viciously snapped at her 
face, seeking something to chew.

Utena kicked outward, sending him flying. Seizing the moment she 
kicked again, this time at the door frame, and soon held a jagged 
piece of lumber in her hand. &#39;A poor stake,&#39; she thought grimly, &#39;but 
it&#39;ll have to do.&#39;

Saionji circled her a bit more cautiously, knowing what wood could do 
to a vampire. &quot;Nothing should disturb the master,&quot; he slurred out, 
licking his chops like a dog.

&quot;You were captain of the kendo team,&quot; Utena plead with him, &quot;admired 
by all the students. You don&#39;t have to be Kiryuu&#39;s dog!&quot;

Making her words a lie, Saionji charged at Utena, howling at her 
madly. He racked at her, clawed, trying to get at her throat. She 
sweep kicked his legs, brought him down to the floor and then lay down 
on top of him. She felt sick as she realized he had an erection.

Utena drove the wood into his heart, and Saionji&#39;s body arched upward. 
His eyes seemed to clear as he gasped out, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Then he 
convulsed, and was still.

Utena pulled a decorative blade off the wall, then in a single stroke 
she removed the head from the body. &quot;Rest in peace, you poor bastard,&quot; 
Utena said to him softly. She looked around her, and saw the elevator 
waiting. &#39;Why do I get the feeling he&#39;d cut the cable?&#39; Utena thought 
wryly of Touga. Instead, she took the stairs.

The stairway spiraled up the tower, and as she walked, she thought she 
could hear women chanting. She couldn&#39;t make out all the words, but 
one bit kept on repeating over and over again, &quot;Absolute destiny 
apocalypse.&quot; The chant grew louder and louder, until finally she 
reached the very top of the stairway.

Looking around the corner carefully, Utena saw that someone had done 
some fairly serious remodeling. The furniture was all gone, the floor 
completely bare except for the rose pattern tiles. Touga watched the 
ladies chant, smiling widely. Occasionally, he would call one over and 
hand her a razor. She would draw it across a vein, filling his glass 
until he waved her away yet again.

Utena took a breath, more out of reflex than anything else, gripped 
her sword and improvised stake firmly, and stepped out into the arena. 
&quot;Kiryuu,&quot; she said loudly, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;

He jerked up, and Touga looked honestly surprised to see her standing 
so brazenly on his very doorstep. &quot;Tenjou,&quot; he scrambled to his feet, 
and then gave her a charming, snake like smile as he said, &quot;would you 
care for a drink?&quot; He made a sweeping gesture to the young women 
nearby, who all smiled at Utena glassily.

Utena&#39;s jaw clenched, and she fought her first response, to take one 
of the girls so cruelly offered her. &quot;This stops now, Kiryuu,&quot; Utena 
said to him coldly, beginning to pace towards him with deliberate 
slowness.

&quot;Stop her,&quot; Touga, sounding more than a bit frightened commanded the 
mob of girls. They scrambled to obey him, charging towards Utena at a 
mad gallop.

They climbed all over her, and all Utena could do was silently swear 
as Touga laughed. &#39;I can&#39;t hurt them, they&#39;re innocents,&quot; she thought, 
struggling under the pile of nubile flesh. The sent of fresh blood 
wafted from them, and Utena could feel her fangs extend, aching. And 
then a forbidden idea occurred to her.

Not letting herself take a moment to reconsider, Utena bit down 
fiercely on one girl, her cry echoing around the room. Then another, 
and another, and another. &#39;He bound them with his mind,&#39; she thought 
grimly, &#39;but I&#39;ve just bound them to me by blood.&#39;

The girls gathered all around her, looking up at Utena in pure 
adoration. &quot;Get out of here,&quot; Utena managed to get out past her aching 
fangs, &quot;and don&#39;t come back.&quot; The girls ran down the stairs, leaving 
Utena and Touga there alone.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you had it in you, Tenjou,&quot; Touga remarked. He added 
with a smile, &quot;Maybe you&#39;re more like us than you&#39;d like to believe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m nothing like you,&quot; Utena scowled. &#39;Or am I?&#39; she found herself 
wondering. &#39;I did that to them so very, very easily. And their blood 
tasted so good!&#39; she thought, a faint shudder running through her slim 
body.

Touga laughed softly. &quot;You&#39;re more like us than those simpering human 
cattle. Join us, Utena, and you could help me rule over them all,&quot; he 
invited.

Surprisingly, Utena smiled sadly. &quot;What I want,&quot; she said to him 
softly, &quot;you can&#39;t offer me, Touga. I want to feel the sun on my face 
again, and to know the warm touch of another human being without 
wanting to kill them.&quot;

Touga&#39;s eyes met Utena&#39;s, and in them she saw that something, some 
deeply buried piece of his former humanity, understood her wish, and 
also understood that she couldn&#39;t be tempted buy him. And then he 
charged.

Utena let him run at her, standing there completely calm. His eyes 
were glazed with madness, his hands out to rip her apart. And still 
she stood there. He reached her, fanged mouth going for her throat, 
when he stiffened.

Touga looked down in shock, at the stake that she had so calmly used 
his own charge to drive home. He frantically tried to grab at the 
wood, but it was simply too slick, covered with his own gore. He 
swayed there, then dropped to his knees in front of her. He looked up 
dazedly, and saw Utena readying the sword.

&quot;Please,&quot; was all Touga got out before she swung.

Utena watched the body drop, and she just felt so cold inside. She had 
managed to kill two of the vampires tonight, she should be feeling 
proud of herself. But she had chosen to taste human blood, and a fire 
now raged inside of her body. Somehow, she knew that the animal blood 
wasn&#39;t going to be enough for her anymore.

Utena heard her coming up the stairs before the sound could have 
reached human ears. &quot;Hello, Anthy,&quot; she said softly, &quot;nice of you to 
join the party.&quot;

Anthy entered the room carefully, holding a stake ready to be used, 
and she gasped softly when she saw the blood around Utena&#39;s mouth. &quot;I 
saw those girls outside, the blood and fang marks,&quot; she said to her 
cautiously.

&quot;Touga controlled them with his mind,&quot; Utena explained to her softly, 
looking down at Toga&#39;s still form, &quot;I needed something stronger to get 
them out of his grip.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Anthy asked her softly.

Utena looked up to meet her eyes, her own dark and unreadable. &quot;No, 
I&#39;m not all right,&quot; she answered softly, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be all 
right ever again.&quot; She bent down to pick up Touga&#39;s remains, &quot;Let&#39;s 
get rid of this, and Saionji downstairs.&quot;

The two were quickly placed on a improvised bonfire, and in a moment 
it was lit. The blaze warmed Utena&#39;s body as she looked into the 
scarlet flames. Looked at what was likely to be her own fate, one day 
soon to come.

The girls that had served Touga milled around a bit, then made their 
way over to where Utena and Anthy were standing. Utena frowned at the 
naked young woman, &quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;To serve you, Mistress,&quot; she said dreamily.

&quot;The blood bond,&quot; Anthy murmured, her eyes widening.

Utena looked at the gathering young women, then over at Anthy. &quot;How do 
I free them?&quot; she asked Anthy rather desperately.

Anthy sighed softly, &quot;You can&#39;t.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

It took all of Juri&#39;s self control not to start laughing at the 
stunned expression on poor Utena&#39;s face. Things had worked out even 
better than she had initially planned.

Having Shiori plant that note she wrote in Touga&#39;s own handwriting 
with the girl&#39;s body had been a stroke of genius on Juri&#39;s part. In 
one stroke two rivals of hers had been eliminated, and in the process 
Utena had been forced to taste human blood at long last.

And now Utena had an army of thralls following her around, all of them 
sweetly willing to do whatever she may want. Juri wondered how long 
even Utena&#39;s strength of will could hold out against all those willing 
young girls. She didn&#39;t think very long.

With a broad smile, Juri silently made her way off into the night. </pre>
