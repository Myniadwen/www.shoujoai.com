<h1>A Special Case (part 5 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/special-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The next morning came all too quickly. I woke up as the alarm went off 
and managed to turn it off before any of the morning news had a chance 
to ruin a perfectly good day. Breakfast was leftovers, a quick set of 
exercises, and I was ready to face the conundrum that called itself 
the world. First up, my client. I didn&#146;t really want to talk to her, 
but I owed her at least the courtesy of a reply. My day was 100% so 
far &#150; she was out. Or just didn&#146;t answer the phone this early. I told 
her I&#146;d be there with bells on, and a report. 

That gave me useful occupation for an hour or so, typing up what I had 
(and hadn&#146;t) learned, and leaving out any useful information, which I 
always do in case my clients feel like doing a run-around on me. Call 
me paranoid.

When I had completed the report, I checked the time and decided it was 
late enough to call Kaoru and set up an appointment. I wondered what 
rabbit hole I&#146;d fall down today and idly whistled &quot;I&#146;m Late&quot; from the 
Disney version while the phone rang. A sleepy voice answered, very 
young. I asked for Kaoru and the voice asked me to hold. It was a long 
time before an older, male voice picked up on the line. I introduced 
myself and mentioned that he had called me yesterday. His voice was 
male, but rather young sounding to be a professor of anything. There 
was a slight note of hesitation in his voice as we set up a meeting. I 
wondered if he was as young as he sounded. We rang off with polite 
words and empty promises.

I yawned and stretched and decided to treat myself to a new suit, or 
at least jacket, today. My account bulged with not-yet-earned gains 
and I deserved something spiffy. Maybe two things. I slipped on my 
shoes and noticed how thin they looked. Maybe shoes too &#150; did they 
count as proper expense? I grinned and decided that even if my client 
couldn&#146;t afford it, I deserved new shoes. Feeling like today was a 
good day, I left the apartment humming to myself.

Shopping in the morning is always weird. Everyone looks at me funny, 
like I should be somewhere else. With almost everyone at work, or 
carting babies around, I guess I do stand out a bit. A few old folks 
were on the streets too and I tipped the hat I don&#146;t wear at them and 
greeted them. Some of the men smiled, most of the ladies did, a few 
scowled at me, wondering what I wanted. I walked to my favorite 
clothes store and let the sales help deck me out in a silk jacket and 
pants, new shirt. Not bad, I thought, as I checked myself out in the 
mirror. I wanted to wear the suit home, but decided not to risk it 
getting dirty before tonight. Next stop shoes. That was a little 
harder. Fashion is a harsh master and I had a difficult time finding 
the right kind of shoes. But when I was done, I knew I&#146;d be the 
shining star at dinner that night.

Entirely pleased with myself, I grabbed a light lunch, then headed for 
the university. I was due to speak with one Kaoru Miki and I couldn&#146;t 
wait.

Kaoru wasn&#146;t at all what I expected. I guess I expected someone more 
aesthete looking, more hunched shoulders and peering eyes over thick 
spectacles. Kaoru was not terribly tall, but lean, athletic and fit. 
His frame moved like a well-oiled machine and it was lovely just 
watching him pace up and down his office. He talked a bit about his 
life at Ohtori, the fencing team. His name kept ringing a bell and 
just about the time he mentioned playing the piano I remembered where 
I had heard it. When I was younger there had been a popular song he 
wrote and recorded. It was overplayed on all the stations and everyone 
got sick of it. As fast as it had come, it was gone. I wondered if he 
ever played it anymore. I realized he had stopped talking and was 
looking at me quizzically. I decided to take a different tack with him 
than I had with the Kiryuu&#146;s.

&quot;Professor Kaoru,&quot; I began with a pleasant smile, &quot;do you remember a 
Himemiya Anshi from school?&quot; I expected a reaction, but not the one I 
got. The Professor, whose lithe frame had not been still since I had 
entered, froze. His complexion went white, then a sickly green. He 
looked like he was going to pass out. I stood to help him, but as if 
he was released from a spell, the blood returned to his face and he 
waved me away. He sat down heavily on the edge of his desk and I 
retreated to my chair.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry,&quot; he passed a hand over his face. His voice was thin and 
shaky. &quot;That name. When you said it, I felt so&#133;&quot; he shook his head and 
stared off into the distance. I wondered if I had just done something 
very, very stupid.

I was about to apologize when he looked up at me with blazing blue 
eyes. &quot;I do remember her, you know.&quot; His voice was intense. &quot;We 
weren&#146;t supposed to. Everyone else forgot, just like the time the 
Black Rose came.&quot; He had lost me after the first sentence, but I was 
unwilling to stop him. The light in his eyes flashed, he looked half 
mad with something I couldn&#146;t place. I could feel my legs tense 
beneath me in preparation for something.

&quot;After it was all over, we felt so&#133;at a loss. None of us knew what to 
do. But there were classes, and clubs and we all just went back to 
them, pretending they had never been, never existed. The letters 
stopped, of course, but we were still the Student Council and we all 
acted like it meant something. But she was gone&#133;gone&#133;&quot; His voice grew 
faint and I sprang up again, just in time to catch him as he fainted.

I called the department receptionist and found some spirits in his 
liquor cabinet. They looked untouched, so I broke a seal and poured a 
glass of something or other. He was stirring on the ground and I 
lifted him and helped him sip the drink. He coughed and spluttered, 
but that seemed to make him feel better. When I sat back, the 
receptionist came in and said she had called the campus EMT squad and 
that they would be here in a few minutes. Kaoru protested, but I 
insisted. The secretary left and he looked at me strangely. I could 
see him as a young boy, from a photo in the file. Weary, almost sad 
eyes, so serious in that uniform. I wondered what burdens it had 
placed upon him.

&quot;I have to tell you, &quot; he laughed self-deprecatingly, &quot;The EMTs won&#146;t 
find anything &#150; it only happens when I try to remember.&quot;

&quot;Try to remember what?&quot; I asked.

&quot;What Utena looked like.&quot; And he lay back on the floor and closed his 
eyes. A moment passed and then he spoke again. &quot;I liked her a great 
deal. She was real. Very down to earth. And she was a good friend. To 
me and to Anshi. Anshi&#133;&quot; he sighed deeply. Still lying on the floor. 
&quot;I loved Anshi you know.&quot; 

I didn&#146;t. &quot;Tell me about her. About Anshi.&quot; I prompted.

&quot;I can&#146;t. It&#146;s all blurred. The only things I can remember are shaved 
ice and math and the piano. It&#146;s all blurred. And every time I think 
of her, I try to see Utena &#150; and this happens.&quot; His voice was thick 
and I tried not to see the tears at the corner of his closed eyes. 

I dug into my pocket and found the photo. &quot;Why don&#146;t you look at 
this?&quot; I held it out and he slowly sat up. Taking it from my hand he 
looked at it for a long time. In perfect silence he stared like a man 
redeemed. I felt my throat close at the look on his face. It was 
rapture.

He held it out for me to take back. &quot;Thank you. Thank you.&quot; His hand 
shook, so I took the picture quickly. &quot;I can already feel it fading, 
but thank you for letting me see them again.&quot; He lay back down, 
groaning with the effort. &quot;I know we&#146;re not supposed to remember. But 
it was nice to see them again.&quot; And he passed out.

I checked his pulse at his wrist and throat. His heartbeat and 
breathing were steady, so I sat there holding his hand until the med 
squad arrived. The put him on the stretcher and asked me questions. I 
told him that it was probably blood sugar or something and they let me 
go.

When I arrived home, I felt drained. This was all so confusing. What 
on earth could possibly make people forget someone so completely? Why? 
Who was my client and why did one person hate her so much, while a man 
who called that woman &quot;friend&quot; loved her? 

I spent the rest of the afternoon doing regular office chores. Calling 
people back, sending out invoices - and typing up the rest of the 
report. I stared at the monitor for a long time. What the hell could I 
say about that interview that wouldn&#146;t make me sound nuts?

The finished product wasn&#146;t satisfactory, but it would do.
