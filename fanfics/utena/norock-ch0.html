<h1>No Rock to Cling to (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve read quite a lot of fanfiction in my years of 
life...some good...some bad...some weirder than I can ever describe. But 
I have always had a big imagination, so this time I decided to let it 
run wild. After an all night Red Bull, sushi, and movie binge with a 
couple of people from the POA staff, we got to discussing anime. Utena 
came up, and of course that led to talk of the final battle. What would 
have happened if Utena wasn&#39;t the princely, gallant person everyone 
usually depicts her as being? What if Anthy and the others later find 
her, but find something totally unexpected? So you can guess the sort of 
scenarios that came from that...this little piece of fiction is one of 
those scenarios...

How it Started

She remembered at the time that she still had days before her next 
paycheck. The job she had taken on, as a clerk in the clothing store 
near the college she attended, just wasn&#39;t cutting it lately. And now 
with most of her money going towards dorm fees and tuition, Utena Tenjou 
was in a rut. She had contemplated on taking on a second job, but her 
studies these days were hard enough as it was. She had no illusions 
about the impossibility of adding more to her plate.

Even now she could recall that dreary November day. It was cold and 
damp, the kind that crept in through the gaps of your jacket and slid 
icy fingers down your neck. The marbled sky wasn&#39;t helping her mood, 
which was already ruined by the grumbling of her stomach. Maybe it was 
pride, or a sense of rebellion, but Utena refused to give in and beg a 
loan off of her dorm mate. The pink haired college student would just 
have to tighten her belt and skip a meal or two...at least until her 
next paycheck. Hell, she thought, it&#39;d be good for her figure.

She was already of a somewhat slender build. Pale skinned and with the 
muscle tone and outward grace of an athlete, she was already getting a 
few looks from some of the guys in her class. But with her icy blue eyes 
and cold demeanor, she quickly put them in their place. Utena simply had 
neither time nor patience to deal with the hassles that came from 
relationships. She could really care less about the phone numbers and 
party invitations she had been racking up. Although they seemed to be 
coming less frequently lately...word of her antisocial attitude had 
gotten around campus.

So it was that with a slightly annoyed mindset, made worse by the 
weather, Utena made her way down a side street in the direction of home. 
It kept her well away from the main strip with all of its torturous 
scents of fried, grilled, and sugar coated delights. It was still 
daylight out, but the road she was traveling was passing along a 
secluded trash littered section of the park, that ran parallel to where 
she was now. An area that had a rough reputation of late. So it wasn&#39;t 
surprising that Utena was feeling more alert than usual. Her hooded 
eyes, shaded by the bangs of her short pink hair, cautiously kept 
glancing about.

That was when she first heard it...the faint pickings of a guitar. It 
came faint and echoing (past the worn parked cars and dilapidated 
buildings) in this run-down part of town. As she continued walking, it 
grew louder in volume to where she was able to make out a tune from the 
jumble of notes. A man was sitting on the back of a park bench with one 
booted foot propped up on the other as he balanced himself with a guitar 
in his lap. He had a large green mohawk and several piercings in his 
eyebrow, nose, ear, and lip. There was a tattoo of some random punk or 
metal band on his arm, which was left bare in the tee shirt he was 
wearing. The shirt itself was a contrasting faded black to the black 
jeans he wore stuffed in the knee-high boots. Altogether, a disturbing 
character.

Utena hoped to continue by him without being stopped, but she had only 
gone two feet in the other direction when a decidedly British-accented 
male voice broke out behind her, &quot;Hey chickie! Hold up a 
minute!&quot;....wonderful...

The light pink curls of hair that fell just past her ear tickled 
slightly as she turned, her face neutral. This guy was the last person 
she wanted to deal with right now. Her voice came out cool, &quot;Yeah?&quot;

The man hurried up to her, stopping just a few feet away from her. 
Ducking his head apologetically, he asked, &quot;Say, do ya know what time it 
is?&quot; Just great. He was probably going to try and mug her or something. 
Not that she couldn&#39;t handle it or anything. It was just the annoyance 
of having to deal with it all together. Flicking out her wrist from 
within the sleeve of her dark green winter coat, the face of the watch 
flashed in the dim light of day. &quot;It&#39;s a quarter of six.&quot;

The man gave a heavy sigh and threw up his hands. &quot;Just great...the gang 
was supposed to meet me here to play a few sets and they never showed 
up! And after they called me out here and all...&quot;

Utena raised a shapely eyebrow in disbelief. It sounded like an unlikely 
story. Why didn&#39;t this guy just hurry up and leave already? Her voice 
came out as incredulous, &quot;Are you certain you were supposed to meet them 
here?&quot; She gestured about them making sure to keep the distance between 
them. The crumbling buildings around them and the graffiti littered 
bench made his story seem off.

&quot;Yeah&quot;, he said with a nod, &quot;The park bench on the corner of Elm Road 
and Dithers Street.&quot; Utena sighed with a wave of dismissal, &quot;You&#39;re not 
on Elm Road. This is Dithers and Walker. Elm Road is parallel to this 
one, clear on the other side of the park.&quot; This guy was either clueless 
or a bad liar. But either way, she didn&#39;t have time for this. As she was 
about to walk away, the guy stopped her progress with a self-mocking 
laugh, &quot;Oh man! No wonder! Hey thanks for the help, chickie! I&#39;d have 
been waiting here all night otherwise.&quot;

That statement struck a chord within Utena&#39;s being for some reason. Her 
face lost a little of its coldness as she asked, &quot;All night...but why? 
If they weren&#39;t coming to meet you, why would you waste your time 
sitting out here in the cold?&quot; The mohawked man gave a lighthearted 
chuckle and stood, &quot;Naw, it wouldn&#39;t have been all night. My friends 
would have found me eventually. They would definitely have come looking 
for me if I hadn&#39;t shown up after awhile.&quot;

Utena looked up at him perplexed. His comment made something within her 
feel hollow and aching. Why did that sort of stupid behavior appeal to 
her? Wasn&#39;t it na&iuml;ve? Had she ever been like that? &quot;Are you so sure your 
&#39;friends&#39; would have come looking for you? Are they really that loyal?&quot; 
Utena&#39;s voice had taken on a harder edge that was sure to rub the other 
guy wrong. The pierced stranger however surprised her by not getting 
upset at all. He simply smiled in confusion as he walked closer.

&quot;Of course. Why would they abandon me? All I&#39;d ha to do was be patient 
and have faith...don&#39;t you have friends like that?&quot;

That turnabout question caught the girl in an awkward and disquieting 
hesitation. But before she could think of what to say, the man appeared 
beside her and gave her a friendly slap on the back. As he began 
steering her down the street he gave another guffawing chuckle, &quot;Hey 
come on, chickie! I&#39;ll buy you a burger down at the fast food place on 
the next block. My way of saying thanks for helping me out.&quot;

Utena was startled by the carefree attitude and offer, and despite her 
protestations they ended up going there anyway. As they picked up the 
food from the attendant, the mohawk man getting more than a few stares 
from those around them, he introduced himself as Jared Summers. He was a 
musician from a local punk-rock group called Crysanthium Ecstasy. Utena 
had merely smirked at the name, which caused Jared to exclaim, &quot;Hey! Got 
you to smile! Yeah, lame name, I know...but we aren&#39;t too bad! You 
should stop by our hangout sometime. We usually plug in at the &#39;Horse 
and Saddle&#39;.&quot;

And that was the turning point in the mundane life of college student 
Utena Tenjou.
