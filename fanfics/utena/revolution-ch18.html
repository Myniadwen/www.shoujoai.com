<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 18 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/revolution-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>There was no sound in space as the mobile suits came
together in a flash of energy, weapons discharging in
the eerie silence, lunging and dancing in a deadly
ballet. Wing Gundam stopped gracefully on it&#39;s
thrusters, the mostly white, red and blue suit
hovering there not far from the colony, then it raced
forward again at the Leos with it&#39;s beam saber alight.

The blocky looking mobile suits were piloted with
skill, the officers inside some of the best of OZ&#39;s
space force, but Wing Gundam was better. It attacked
with unearthly skill to disable the four suits and
ultimately leave them hanging there in space, floating
above the colony they had attempted to launch a
surprise assault against.

Within the Gundam&#39;s cockpit Arisugawa Juri felt her
breath slowly calming, the pure black flightsuit she
wore making her orange hair glow even brighter in the
green lights from her control panel. &#39;It gets a little
easier every time,&#39; she mused, reaching up to activate
her suit&#39;s radio. &quot;This is Arisugawa,&quot; she said
crisply, &quot;I&#39;ve got four suits and pilots to be
recovered in section twelve, please. Let Howard and
his boys know, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure the engineers will appreciate four more
suits to repair for the colony resistance,&quot; Hilde&#39;s
voice was amused. &quot;The captain was wondering if you&#39;d
be coming in, yet?&quot; she asked, a bit of concern in her
voice.

&quot;As soon as I finish my patrol sweep,&quot; Juri answered
her, signing off. With that she returned to her
patrol, the Gundam shining against the inky blackness
of space. Juri smiled to herself wryly as they flew,
&#39;It&#39;s been such a crazy few months, I almost can&#39;t
believe I&#39;m out here, now.&#39;

After the open declaration of hostilities between the
space colonies and Earth&#39;s government, a recall order
had been sent out to all the Gundams, asking them to
assist with the colony defense. Juri quickly made her
decision where her loyalties lay and threw in her lot
in with the colonies, taking out the Wing Gundam in
battle for the very first time. She assisted two of
the four other Gundams in acquiring space transport,
then she discovered that the &#39;bird&#39; mode of the Wing
Gundam was in fact space launch capable.

&#39;Of course, it wasn&#39;t all smooth sailing when I got
here,&#39; Juri mused, her Gundam coasting by a band of
the refit Mobile Suits that were stationed by the
colony.

There had been a real debate among the colony
leadership over if she should keep the Wing Gundam,
not to mention questioning Juri&#39;s own loyalties. Of
course her past enmity with OZ helped relieve their
fears a bit, and Duo Maxwell and Dr. J were both
willing to speak up for her. Quatre Winner was
cautiously friendly towards her, Trowa Barton was
mostly neutral and Wu Fei Cheng completely distrusted
her. Not that Wu Fei seemed to have much use for any
of the other pilots, but he really had issues towards
her.

A soft chime reminded Juri her shift was over, and
with a gentle twist of her wrist she turned her Gundam
around, thrusters carrying her forward to the colony.
The outer ring slowly grew in her viewscreen, then she
shifted her course slightly to head for the open
docking bay, the lights a warm beacon to her in the
depths of space. Landing a bit roughly in the sudden
return of gravity she maneuvered her Gundam to it&#39;s
cradle, smiling as she saw the maintenance crew
rushing to their positions all around it even as they
bay doors closed. She climbed out the hatch and walked
along the catwalk to a airlock, cycling through to get
access to the colony itself.

As Juri took off her helmet she heard a voice call out
to her, &quot;Lieutenant!&quot;

Juri looked around curiously, then realized he was
calling to her. &quot;Yes,&quot; she turned, silently wondering
when she&#39;d get used to her new rank.

Not that the colony defense forces had ranks at first,
things had been wildly chaotic at first. There really
hadn&#39;t been much planning when the colonies made the
decision to openly declare hostilities with Earth, and
the fear of similarities to OZ and the Earth&#39;s
military slowed them down even more. Still, they had
quickly realized that some kind of structure was
needed, and by necessity the Gundam pilots got bumped
up pretty fast.

&quot;Lieutenant Arisugawa,&quot; the young man nodded, his
insignia marking him as a engineering officer, &quot;the
chief asked me to convey his thanks.&quot;

Juri chuckled, &quot;Actually from what I&#39;ve heard I bet
Howard is probably bitching that I&#39;m piling even more
work on him and his boys and would I stop being so
damn gung-ho capturing suits.&quot; She grinned at him,
&quot;How close was that?&quot;

He blinked at her, &quot;Pretty much word for word, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for increasing his workload,&quot; Juri said as
she casually unbuttoned to top of her flight suit,
&quot;but we need as many Mobile Suits as possible
operational.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the brown haired young man nodded. He
had to hurry to keep pace, &quot;Commander Hilde is holding
a meeting later with the new diplomat, she asked
Harold to remind you that she&#39;d like you to attend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Juri agreed, her gaze softening. She
nodded as they reached her quarters, &quot;Thank you for
delivering the message, Scott.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, ma&#39;am,&quot; he saluted then Scott was
off.

Entering her room Juri sighed in relief as she
stripped her flightsuit off, stepping nude into the
sonic cleanser and briskly cleaning hours of sweat
from her body. Toweling off she laid a new flightsuit
out on the bed if needed, then pulled on one of the
new Defense Force uniforms. A simple gray it carried
her name, rank insignia and the shoulder patch
indicating she was a mobile suit pilot.

&quot;And why the rose crest?&quot; Juri murmured, reaching up
to touch the rose that was a central part of the
patch. It was one of many things Juri was trying to
get to the bottom of, much like the rose signets that
the Gundam pilots all wore. She had felt a chill when
she first saw them, and found herself wondering if the
OZ pilots had more duelists there, too, like Colonel
Une.

The halls of the colony were busy as usual when Juri
headed out again later, determined to make her next
appointment. She headed down the hall to the elevators
then took them up several levels, reaching what had
been designed as a administrative section for the
massive structure. Finding the proper room she
knocked, then went inside.

Commander Hilde looked up as she entered, the brown
haired young woman&#39;s face lighting up in a smile.
&quot;Welcome,&quot; she smiled, &quot;and good work today, by the
way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled slightly.

In charge of the mobile suit pilots Hilde was Juri&#39;s
superior officer, but it was a complex relationship.
Hilde was nearly the same age as Juri and a fine pilot
herself, as such she was well aware of the sort of
personalities it took to be a pilot. She kept them in
line without riding them too hard, as well as getting
results for the colony leadership. It was a difficult
tightrope to walk, and Juri didn&#39;t envy Hilde in the
slightest.

&quot;Anything interesting in our latest acquisitions?&quot;
Juri asked as Hilde casually waved her over to a seat
at the table.

&quot;Standard Leos,&quot; Hilde said as she sat, too, &quot;and
young pilots.&quot;

Juri shrugged, &quot;I guess it&#39;s to be expected, Treise
knows he can&#39;t waste his aces against us when he also
has to be worried about defending Fortress Barge.&quot;

&quot;I thought that was what he was saving his Tallgeese
wing for,&quot; Hilde said dryly.

&quot;Too bad he&#39;s down two pilots,&quot; Juri added. A grim
little smile, &quot;Have Noin or Po decided to talk to us,
yet?&quot;

&quot;Not a word,&quot; Hilde sighed, &quot;just name, rank and
serial number.&quot;

Juri shook her head, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe their own
pilot shot them in the back during Treise&#39;s attempted
big push.&quot;

Earth had launched a powerful force from Fortress
Barge shortly after Juri had arrived, as many Leos as
they could scrape together lead by three of the
Tallgeese, and tried to overwhelm the defenders. The
Gundams, Hilde, and every suit they could muster went
out to meet them in space, and they were only barely
able to stop them. And in the chaos, two of the
Tallgeese were shot by their comrade, the devastating
shots coming from a completely unexpected direction.
The pilots would probably have died if Juri and the
Gundams hadn&#39;t dragged back the wrecked Tallgeese
units, if only to use them for spare parts.&quot;

&quot;Noin did relent and tell us who probably shot them,&quot;
Hilde said and as Juri looked at her attentively she
added, &quot;Dorothy Catalonia.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy...&quot; Juri frowned, trying to place the name.
She finally just smiled grimly, &quot;I&#39;ll have to remember
that name.&quot;

There was a knock on the door and Hilde called,
&quot;Enter.&quot;

The young woman who entered wore a simple but elegant
suit, just the thing for a diplomat, and Juri
recognized her almost immediately. The long brown hair
was tied back in a braid, she moved with a sure and
confident step, but there really hadn&#39;t been much
change since Juri had last seen her.

&quot;Commander,&quot; Releena said then smiled warmly, &quot;Juri.&quot;

&quot;Ambassador Peacecraft,&quot; Hilde smiled devilishly as
she looked towards Juri, &quot;I believe you two have met?&quot;</pre>
