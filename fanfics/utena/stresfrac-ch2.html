<h1>Stress Fractures (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/stresfrac-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Utena locked the door behind her. She wasn&#146;t worried about a breakin, 
it was more a feeling of internal peace she craved. When the door was 
locked, she was in her haven. Her quiet, peaceful place of refuge. She 
took off her coat and hat and walked into the kitchen to make herself 
tea. The water, the tea, each in its orderly place, each with its own 
comfort of the predictable. 

Who was that woman today? She wasn&#146;t a homeless person, nor a 
beggar...maybe she was crazy? Utena had to admit she hadn&#146;t seemed 
crazy, just confused. No, not even that. Determined. And there was 
something about her, a conviction that almost made you believe....

Utena sat at the table, clasping her cup in her hands. The warmth of 
the porcelain seeped into her chilled bones, and she relaxed slightly. 
Wrenching her mind away from the stranger who knew her name, Utena 
turned her thoughts forcibly to her plans for the week. She jotted a 
few lists and notes on a piece of paper and sat quietly, drinking her 
tea, contemplating the strange event that had intruded itself into her 
regulated life.

Her thoughts wandered, however, into the past, and she thought, as she 
often did, of the Aunt she hadn&#39;t seen in years, not since she had 
moved to Amsterdam. Once a year on her birthday, Utena received a card 
and a letter, but aside from a new snapshot every once in a while, her 
Aunt was no longer part of her life. Neither were the parents she had 
lost so long ago, or the husband she had left. Not one to make many 
friends, Utena had built a simple life, one that was predictable, 
regular. A unaccustomed wave of loneliness surged through Utena and 
she lowered her head, her eyes moist.

The cup of tea was less than half full and the liquid slopped against 
the sides of the cup as her hands shook. The light over the table was 
reflected and distorted by the motion, making it hard to see the 
pattern on the cup&#39;s bottom. Utena focused her vision in confusion. 
Pattern on the cup&#39;s bottom? This cup had no pattern, this set had no 
decoration of any kind.

She pulled her hands away as if the cup had suddenly become scalding. 
As the tea settled, she could clearly make out the stylized image of a 
rose on the bottom of the cup. Picking the cup up as though it might 
further metamorphose into a fanged serpent, Utena carried it into the 
kitchen and emptied its contents into the sink. Holding the object up, 
she was startled to see that the cup itself was shaped to be 
reminiscent of a rose.  Utena stared in horrific fascination at this 
unfamiliar cup, into which she had poured her tea and from which she 
had drunk. Placing it on the counter, she threw open the cabinet with 
something like desperation, and found herself staring at the neatly 
organized rows of white, unadorned, cup-shaped tea cups, coffee cups 
and glasses from which she had removed this aberration only minutes 
before.

Utena looked once more at the strange cup then, leaving it on the 
counter unwashed, walked to the entrance, put on her coat and hat and 
shoes and left the house.
