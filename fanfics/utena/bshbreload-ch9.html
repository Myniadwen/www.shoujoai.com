<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bshbreload-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The girl paced her bedroom, wondering if her love
letter had arrived, then she gasped softly, feeling
the hands coming from behind her to stroke up and down
the front of her slim body. Naked other than her
nightie she shivered as her full breasts were fondled,
then moaned as the hand swiftly slid down her front
and cupped her, gently. That scent washed over her,
her own heat filling the air as she moaned out, &quot;Oh
Mistress.&quot;

A slim finger gently looked for the opening, and Juri
bent forward to whisper in the smaller girl&#39;s ear, &#147;Do
you want it, Reiko?&#148;

Another breathless gasp, as Reiko thrust her hips back
and forth looking for that teasing finger. &#147;Oh yes,
please,&#148; she gave the strangled cry.

Juri gave a wicked smile, then slid her finger into
the waiting wetness. She enjoyed exciting her lovely
conquests, teasing them to heights of arousal, it made
the blood all the sweeter. Setting aside her thoughts
Juri let her fangs graze Reiko&#39;s throat. A soft cry
from the girl, and then she let her fangs slip into
the sweet flesh and tasted the hot blood. Her hands
continued to stroke the girl&#39;s body knowingly, the
girl shuddering and twisting underneath her.

&quot;Ahh.. ah... &quot; Reiko gasped out, the twin sensations
of expertly plunging fingers and her gushing blood
overwhelming her.

&quot;Aw, the child fainted,&quot; Juri smiled fondly, gently
stopping the bleeding before she carried the sweat
covered girl into her bed. She paused to look down at
her, considering, then she rose silently, and like a
ghost slipped out of the room and into the dark night.

In their large rooms Shiori looked up to smile at her
as Juri came through the window, &#147;Good evening,
Juri-sama.&#148;

&#147;Hello, Shiori,&#148; Juri smiled back, gazing at her
lovely companion. Dressed in panties, her small but
firm breasts uncovered she looked both vibrantly
healthy and deeply wanton. Few knew that this lovely
child was nearly as wild as the notorious Kozue, only
finally settling down when she fell under Juri&#39;s sway.

Shiori sat up in the large bed, her short violet hair
flowing against her face as she asked, &quot;Is anything
wrong?&quot;

&quot;Oh. nothing,&quot; Juri smiled as she slid into bed beside
Shiori, nuzzling at her playfully. They kissed,
tongue&#39;s dueling then slid apart breathlessly.

&#147;Oh, you&#39;ve fed again,&#148; Shiori laughed happily, &#147;that
always gets you going.&#148; She licked Juri&#39;s cheek,
marveling at the smooth flesh then nipped delicately
at her neck, sucking in imitation of Juri&#39;s own
hungers.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Juri cooed, the powerful vampire willingly
letting the smaller Shiori take the lead this time.
She smiled as Shiori climbed on top, undoing Juri&#39;s
uniform top to reveal the swell of her bone pale
breasts, the nipples standing up a deeper rose.

Shiori pulled at the nipples almost savagely as she
bent forward, sucking reddened flesh into her mouth,
stroking with her tongue. Juri&#39;s scent rose from her
body, the sweet scent of her heat making Shiori
strangely light headed Her fingers teased across the
firm, muscled belly to stop at the top button of
Juri&#39;s pants...

&quot;Please,&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was rough with her need,
raising her hips involuntarily seeking more sensation
from her lover&#39;s touch.

The button opened with a flick of Shiori&#39;s wrist,
revealing sheer black panties made of the finest silk.
The front of them was soaked with Juri&#39;s arousal, the
scent now filling the room. &quot;I love you,&quot; Shiori
moaned, sliding her fingers beneath the waistband.

Juri cried out as Shiori stroked her, skillfully
teasing her hard clit, then rapidly plunging her
fingers into Juri&#39;s wet cleft. With a cry Juri came,
then those relentless fingers brought her off again.
Weakly Juri plucked those fingers from her sensitive
flesh, &quot;Enough.&quot;

Shiori brought her fingers to her lips, a pointed
tongue flicking out to clean her sticky fingers, She
lay along Juri&#39;s sweaty body, resting as Juri quickly
caught her breath. &quot;You look your most beautiful when
you come,&quot; Shiori murmured softly.

&quot;There&#39;s no one else I&#39;d trust to be so vulnerable
too,&quot; Juri murmured, &quot;thank you.&quot;

Shiori smiled happily, resting her head on Juri&#39;s cool
shoulder. They lay there together in the silence then,
&#147;So how are things going with Utena?&#148;

&#147;Making steady progress,&#148; Juri answered. She looked at
Shiori thoughtfully, &#147;It doesn&#39;t make you jealous,
knowing that I&#39;m after her?&#148;

Shiori shook her head, &#147;I know that you love me, but I
can&#39;t be your equal. Utena is, and I think she&#39;ll be
good for you.&#148;

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Juri answered, kissing her gently.



Early the next day Wakaba nearly ran into the girl who
was stumbling down the hallway. Her eyes were heavy, a
large red mark was on her neck, and a remarkably goofy
smile was on her face. `Someone was with Juri last
night,&#39; Wakaba correctly deduced.

Juri fed almost every night, choosing a young woman
from the dorm and taking from her what she needed to
survive. More importantly to the girl&#39;s she chose Juri
sought to pleasure them before she fed, using what
were becoming nearly legendary skills on them. There
were rumors that there was actually a waiting list to
be with the charismatic vampiress.

Wakaba walked into her classroom, and noticed the
still empty seat a few behind hers. `Oh, Utena,&#39; she
thought a bit sadly as she sat down at her seat, `I
wish you could be here.&#39;

The two of them had first met in this very classroom,
the boyish transfer student longing in her boy&#39;s
school uniform. Wakaba had eagerly volunteered to give
her the tour of the school, and she led her around the
campus happily. When Wakaba&#39;s first room-mate had
moved out for personal reasons, she tentatively
suggested that Utena move in with her, and she could
barely contain the joy she felt when she did.

Wakaba knew what the other students thought, of
course. The handsome, boyish Utena and Wakaba moving
in together was the subject of all the local gossips.
But nothing had ever happened between them, even
though she wouldn&#39;t have minded. But Utena was always
the perfect gentleman, and she couldn&#39;t quite figure
out how to approach her.

`Other than saying something like,&#39; Wakaba thought,
`kiss me, you fool!&#39;

Then Akio had taken an interest in Utena, and Wakaba
had been filled with fear. The Dean of Students was a
handsome man, but he had such a bad reputation. He
courted Utena, but each time he came to her, she blew
him off. Finally, she agreed to go out to dinner with
him.

`And that&#39;s when things got really strange,&#39; Wakaba
thought grimly.

Akio had carried Utena home, smoothly claiming that
Utena had drank a bit too much. He asked Wakaba to
stay with her and filled with concern for her friend,
she agreed. Utena slept like the dead for nearly three
days, her body stiff and cold, then on the third night
she awakened.

The return to wakefulness had been quite sudden, Utena
laying there deathly still on the bed one moment, then
she literally shot right up, staring. Her blue eyes
were wild, her skin bone pale, but Wakaba didn&#39;t care
about that. Tearfully she wrapped her arms around
Utena, and her own arms came up around her. Utena
shook, and Wakaba was astonished at how cold Utena
felt against her skin. She drew back a bit to ask a
question, and saw them.

Shaking like a leaf, Utena sat there with her mouth
open, her piercing fangs gleaming and extended.
&#147;What&#39;s happening?&#148; Utena managed to get out.

&#147;Oh, Utena,&#148; Wakaba whispered in shock. Suddenly,
looking at her friend, something seemed to click
inside of her head, and she knew. Tentatively, she
asked her, &#147;What happened, when you went out with
Akio?&#148;

Utena was shivering slightly, tightly wrapping her
arms around her body as she rocked in the chair. &#147;He
lied to me,&#148; she whispered softly, &#147;he took me to the
observatory, and then...&quot; her voice broke, &quot;he raped
me.&#148; Her eyes grew wide, &#147;He bit me really hard, on
the neck.&#148; Her hands shook a bit as she reached up but
she felt only whole skin at the side of her throat.

&#147;Stay here,&#148; Wakaba ordered, and then ran out into the
hallway. `Utena&#39;s not eaten anything in three days,&#39;
she thought, `in her shoes I&#39;d be starving.&#39; She
looked around wildly, then remembered something. &#147;I
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&#148; she softly muttered,
kneeling in front of the mouse hole. She reached
inside quickly, and yelped as something bit her. She
grabbed, feeling something furry, and yanked it out.

Wakaba carried it into the dorm room and then hurried
over to Utena&#39;s side. `I hope she knows what to do
with this,&#39; was the odd thought that suddenly occurred
to her as she pressed the struggling rat into Utena&#39;s
hands. Utena looked down at the rat in her hands, then
her humanity just seemed to... disappear. The fangs
gleamed in the darkness, extending downward, and Utena
brought the struggling creature up to her mouth.

&#147;Ack!&#148; Wakaba cried out incoherently as a bit of blood
splattered her cheek. Utena feeding was like a feral
animal, focused only on satisfying her hunger. In a
few moments, the rat was dead, and Utena cradled it in
her hands. She looked up, and as her blue eyes met
Wakaba&#39;s they seemed to be much clearer than before.

Once she had finished consuming the rat a lone tear
trickled down Utena&#39;s cheek, and Wakaba was shocked to
see the liquid was blood. &#147;What am I?&#148; Utena breathed
out, a expression of dawning horror on her face.

`Of course, we eventually figured out what was going
on,&#39; Wakaba thought. She noticed students rising from
their seats, and realized she had daydreamed right
through the class. She walked by a window and looked
out, catching a moment of sun breaking through the
gray clouds. `Utena loved the sun,&#39; she thought sadly.

&#147;Good morning,&#148; a voice said cheerfully from behind
her, jarring her from her thoughts. Wakaba quickly
turned, and had to fight the urge to scowl as she saw
that it was Anthy who was addressing her. She
completely ignored the hostile look Wakaba was giving
her, &#147;Could you help me with something?&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148; Wakaba asked her noncommittally. She was
Utena&#39;s helper, long before Anthy came along, and
Wakaba was sure Anthy also had something to do with
all of the naked girls that were hanging around
Utena&#39;s rooms.

Still sounding quite cheerful, Anthy asked her, &#147;Could
you tell me anything that you can about Kanae Ohtori?&#148;

Wakaba frowned as she pointed out, &quot;Utena wouldn&#39;t be
happy about you looking into her activities on your
own.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try not to let that bother me,&quot; Anthy answered
dryly. More seriously she said, &quot;If she is a vampire
she&#39;ll be more vulnerable during the day.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Wakaba hesitated.

&quot;I could always ask Kozue if she&#39;d be willing to help
me,&quot; Anthy suggested.

Wakaba frowned at Anthy, her eyes hard. &quot;Kozue doesn&#39;t
know enough about all of this,&quot; she said intensely,
&quot;don&#39;t you dare....&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Anthy conceded. quickly raising a calming
hand. Looking at Wakaba entertainingly she said,
&quot;Please help.&quot;

&quot;Help with what?&quot; the voice asked. Both women turned
in surprise to see Nanami Kiryuu standing there, the
little blonde looking them both over with a slight
smile. &quot;If you&#39;re going to talk privately,&quot; she
smiled, &quot;best not to do it in a school hallway.&quot;



In another part of the campus the room was nearly
completely dark, only a few burning candles providing
a little light. A figure sat on the chair in the
middle of the room, mumbling to itself softly as the
flickering light danced

&#147;Mistress?&#148; a young man asked, carrying a candle ahead
of him as he opened the door and walked into the room.

The light revealed a young woman sitting there, her
skin so pale as to be parchment white. Her light green
hair fell limply over her shoulders, her eyes wide as
her lips slowly moved, the soft mumbling continuing
on. She suddenly seemed to notice him, and a broad
smile light up her face as he drew closer.

&#147;My love,&#148; she smiled at him.

&#147;Mistress Kanae,&#148; he started, &#147;I&#39;m not...&#148;

&#147;I&#39;ve missed you,&#148; Kanae smiled, getting up from her
chair to step up beside him. &#147;Where have you been?&#148;
she asked.

&#147;I was just next door,&#39; the boy blinked in surprise.

&#147;I thought you were being unfaithful again,&#148; Kanae
began to run her fingers across his chest, &#147;if you
were, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&#148;

&#147;I am your faithful servant, m&#39;lady,&#148; he managed to
squeak out.

&#147;Good, good,&#148; she murmured. Her eyes narrowed in
anger, &#147;If you were unfaithful, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d
do.&#148; He hissed in pain as her nails raked his chest,
then she whispered, &#147;I think it would tear my heart
out.&#148;

Her hand shot forward, then smoothly drew back. He
flopped to the floor bonelessly, twitching for a
moment before he was still. Kanae looked at the still
beating heart in her hand, then at the boy in
surprise. &#147;Why, you&#39;re not Akio at all,&#148; she said
wonderingly, bringing the heart up to her mouth to
drink.</pre>
