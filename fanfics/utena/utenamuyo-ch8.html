Touga Kiryuu, current victor of the duels, looked up
to meet his dueling partner with a charming smile...
only to blink in surprise when a unfamiliar figure
entered the dueling arena. &quot;Who are you,&quot; the redhead
asked, &quot;and where&#39;s Utena?&quot;

&quot;Name&#39;s Ryoko,&quot; the blue haired woman dressed in a red
and black body suit said casually, &quot;I&#39;m filling in.&quot;

&quot;Filling in?&quot; Touga asked dryly.

&quot;Seems Utena had some of Anthy&#39;s curry again...&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Touga winced. Anthy&#39;s exploding cooking was
legendary around the academy, to be eaten at your own
risk.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Ryoko said, &quot;seems my mom owes Utena&#39;s aunt
a favor or some such, so she called me in to repay the
debt.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Touga murmured. He maintained a calm
appearance but inside he felt more than a bit of
discomfort. His whole strategy on facing Utena had
been based as much on psychological factors as dueling
skill, and having this newcomer fight in her place
meant his careful preperation had been for nothing.

&quot;We doing this soon?&quot; Ryoko looked around crossly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Anthy hurried across the dueling arena,
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to be late.&quot;

&quot;What kept you?&quot; Touga frowned disapprovingly.

Anthy reached up to adjust her glasses as she said
apologetically, &quot;Well, Utena was having her stomach
pumped and...&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ryoko quickly cut her off before she
could go into any kind of detail, &quot;could we start
please?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Touga sighed, also not wanting to hear any
more details.

&quot;The duel ends if you lose your rose,&quot; Anthy cautioned
as she put a almost icy blue flower at the breast of
Ryoko&#39;s costume.

&quot;Seems simple enough,&quot; Ryoko agreed, &quot;let&#39;s get on
with it.&quot;

Anthy walked to Touga&#39;s side as she declared, &quot;O Roses
of the noble castle, O Power of Dios that slumbers
within me, harken unto thy master and reveal to us...&quot;
She fell back into his arms as a light shone forth
from her chest.

Drawing the Sword of Dios from her chest Touga
finished dramatically, &quot;...the power to revolutionize
the world!&quot;

Clap! Clap! Clap!

&quot;Very snazzy,&quot; Ryoko conceded, &quot;I can&#39;t top that.&quot; She
gestured and a blade composed of pure red energy
appeared, &quot;But I think this&#39;ll do.&quot;

&#39;Obviously this is not a normal duelist,&#39; Touga
blinked, feeling his confidence waver. He shook
himself and said politely, &quot;Ladies first.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I do,&quot; Ryoko dived forward, swinging
her blade wildly.

Touga ducked and swung, but with a grace that a cat
would envy Ryoko twisted aside. &#39;She&#39;s good,&#39; he
realized as her return strike nearly took off his
head. Back and forth they fought, Touga doding the
unknown weapon of the mystery woman even as he
searched for a opening.

&quot;Y&#39;know,&quot; Ryoko said conversationally, &quot;playing like
this is fun but I&#39;m getting kinda bored. Time to
finish this.&quot;

This time there was no dodging the strike so Touga
desperately parried with the Sword of Dios... only to
see the Sword sheared in half by the energy blade. A
second strike turned his rose to garbage, sending
charred petals spiraling to the ground.

&quot;Well that was unexpected,&quot; Akio Ohtori blinked, his
stylish purple hair falling into his eyes, his shirt
half open.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Washu said cheerfully, the red headed
woman offering a container as she asked, &quot;more sake?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Akio held out his cup.

&quot;The duels are both a physical and psychic
phenomenon,&quot; Washu took on a lecturing tone, &quot;where to
people&#39;s wills battle as much or more so than the
clash of swords.&quot;

&quot;So your Ryoko had a stronger will?&quot; Akio looked
thoughtful.

&quot;Partially,&quot; Washu drank her own sake, &quot;and there&#39;s
another factor involved.&quot;

Akio drank gracefully, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;The blade Ryoko uses is a manifestation of pure
psionic force,&quot; Washu shrugged, &quot;in the arena it&#39;s a
ace against almost anyone.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll make the dueling game we&#39;re arranged rather
one sided,&quot; Akio frowned.

&quot;Not if I provide blades to your duelists,&quot; Washu gave
a evil grin, &quot;not to mention bringing in a few ringers
of my own.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s annoy your little Ryoko,&quot; Akio smiled slyly.

&quot;She could use a little annoyance,&quot; Washu shrugged
casually. &quot;More sake?&quot;

&quot;This could be very entertaining,&quot; Akio held out his
cup with a smile.

&quot;To the power to revolutionize the world,&quot; Washu
toasted.

&quot;To the power,&quot; Akio agreed.

Ryoko walked out of the dueling arena casually, her
long blue hair flowing down her back as she passed the
street lamps. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Ryoko asked
as she saw Anthy waiting by the enterance way.

&quot;I am the Rose Bride,&quot; Anthy smiled respectfully, &quot;and
I belong to you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I was just there subbing for Utena.&quot; Ryoko
quickly protested as Anthy and she walked off
together.

&quot;You won the duel,&quot; Anthy was gentle but firm, &quot;you
are now my betrothed.&quot;

&#39;What the hell,&quot; Ryoko said after a moment, &quot;I&#39;ve had
worse situations in my life.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;All
5000 years of it.&#39;

&quot;What would you like to do now?&quot; Anthy asked after a
moment.

Ryoko slapped Anthy on the shoulder, &quot;Let&#39;s go get a
drink.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not old enough...&quot; Anthy started.

Ryoko shook her head as she commented, &quot;Don&#39;t kid a
kidder. We both know you&#39;re way older than you seem.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Anthy hesitated, clearly thrown by this bold
woman.

&quot;First, I&#39;ll introduce you to sake,&quot; Ryoko grinned
impishly, &quot;then we&#39;ll see what else we can round up.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Anthy said faintly.

&quot;Chu,&quot; Chu-chu watched disaprovingly.

&quot;Myah?&quot; Ryo-Ohki surprised it, sending the mouse
scurrying away.

&quot;Chu!&quot; Chu-chu raced erratically.

&quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-Ohki exclaimed, chasing her new toy with
glee.

End...?

Notes: A &#39;serious&#39; crossover between Tenchi Muyo and
Utena&#39;d be a pretty one sided fic, so I decided to go
at it in a humorous way. The idea that the duels are
both physical as well as mental came from reading the
Big Eyes Small Mouth RPG guides to Utena, but I liked
it so I worked it into this fic.</pre>
