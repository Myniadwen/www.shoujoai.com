<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 9 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Utena hesitated in the doorway, part of her still feeling both 
repelled at what she was about to do and terribly guilty, but a larger 
part was eager for what was to come. She was so hungry, and they knew 
that it was her time to feed.

        The blue haired girl steeped out of the shadows to meet her, 
smiling up at Utena gently. &quot;It&#39;s my turn tonight,&quot; Ami said quietly.

        Part of Utena wanted to just grab her and pull her close, but 
she restrained herself. &quot;Are you sure that you want to...&quot; she began 
to ask when the girl gently put her finger on Utena&#39;s lips, shushing 
her with an amused expression.

        &quot;You ask us that every time,&quot; Ami chuckled softly, &quot;I would 
have thought that by now you would have realized we follow you of our 
own free will.&quot;

        Ami reached up to take her glasses off, revealing eyes that 
were smoky with desire. She removed her blouse and skirt next, leaving 
her only in her underwear and socks. She opened up her arms, looking 
up at Utena with intense want.

        Utena took the half step forward, leaning down slightly to 
kiss the pretty young woman, her tongue flickering along soft lips and 
across white teeth. Ami seemed to swoon, surrendering herself to the 
stronger woman.

        They stumbled together to the bed, Utena laying Ami out over 
the fresh sheets. In an oddly intimate gesture she helped slide Ami&#39;s 
socks off, then opened the front clasp of the girl&#39;s bra. She kissed 
along her jaw, licking at the base of her throat, then teased each of 
those up thrust nipples with her tongue as she caressed the pert 
breasts.

        &quot;Oh, Utena-sama,&quot; Ami sighed dreamily.

        Utena continued to feast on those breasts, careful to keep her 
fangs sheathed. A cool hand slid over Ami&#39;s ribs, then down across a 
flat belly to the top of her pale blue panties. She stroked along the 
front of them until she felt the hips rise up in wanton invitation, 
and then slid her fingers under the cloth into warm wetness.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Ami cried out, her body twisting and turning under that 
fevered caress, but Utena kept her fingers right on target.

        Utena lay her body over Ami&#39;s, enjoying her erratic movements 
as she brought her face up next to hers. She timed it carefully, 
bringing Ami as close to the edge as she could before softly asking, 
&quot;Do you want it? Do you?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Ami whimpered, &quot;yes!&quot;

        Utena slid down Ami&#39;s body to find herself over the rounded 
swell of her breasts once again. The fangs gleamed in the darkness, 
then she struck even as she used a gentle twist of her fingers to 
bring Ami over the edge.

        &quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Ami&#39;s body tensed in pleasure.

        &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Juri noted with an impish smile.

        Juri and Shiori sat close together on the living room couch, 
while Anthy, Wakaba and Juri sat scattered around the room, all with 
mildly embarrassed looks on their faces. The walls were, of course, 
insulated, but vampire hearing was acute, and even the two humans had 
heard enough to know what was going on in there.

        Wakaba was blushing fiercely, looking down uncomfortably in 
her chair. But Juri&#39;s senses were keen, and despite how Wakaba was 
acting she was picking up something else loud and clear: a strong 
scent of arousal from the girl.

        Anthy realized whom Juri was gazing at so intently and softly 
cautioned her, &quot;Don&#39;t even think about trying it.&quot;

        With a little smile Juri asked, &quot;And why not?&quot;

        Anthy kept quiet, &quot;Because Utena cares about her very much, 
and if you did try anything, she&#39;d probably stake first and ask 
questions later.&quot;

        Juri nodded thoughtfully, &quot;A point.&quot;

        Shiori silently filed away that fact, watching them all 
intently. She had known Juri and Anthy didn&#39;t get along well, but 
there was something else going on there, too. And this Wakaba, she 
could be a useful tool if Shiori felt the need to stir up a little 
trouble.

        Quietly Shiori spoke up, &quot;Juri-sama, I&#39;m bored.&quot; The orange 
haired woman looked down at her and she smiled up, &quot;I know that we 
need to stay together, to watch each others backs. But do we need to 
stay cooped up in this apartment all the time?&quot;

        Ruka raised an eyebrow, &quot;Personally, I&#39;d rather be as bit 
bored than dead.&quot;

        &quot;We haven&#39;t seen or heard of Mrs. Ohtori since Shiori escaped 
from her a week ago,&quot; Juri pointed out, &quot;it could be that she simply 
left town.&quot;

        Anthy raised her teacup, carefully drinking the animal blood 
within. &quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; she said as she sat the cup down, &quot;but not 
very likely. She perused us all the way to Tokyo. I doubt that she 
will simply give up the hunt now.&quot;

        &quot;It could be that something else has drawn her interest away,&quot; 
Utena said to them quietly as she walked out from the back bedroom. 
Her clothes were a bit rumpled, but she looked much better, a bit of 
red to her cheeks. She smiled at the surprised look on Anthy&#39;s face 
and explained, &quot;Just for the sake of argument, of course.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re going to have to go outside soon, anyway,&quot; Wakaba 
surprised them by speaking up softly. When everyone looked over at her 
she shrugged slightly, &quot;We&#39;re running out of food for me and Utena&#39;s 
groupies.&quot;

        &quot;Hey!&quot; Utena protested that description of her thralls, no 
matter how accurate it might be. Juri actually chuckled, and Anthy had 
to hide a smile.

        &quot;And,&quot; Wakaba added, &quot;we&#39;re going to be out of medical and 
animal blood soon, too.&quot;

        &quot;We can&#39;t have that,&quot; Shiori sighed. Drinking the blood from 
medical packets was beginning to irritate her, she had to admit. She 
missed holding someone, drinking deeply as their heartbeat slowed then 
gradually came to a stop.

        Utena looked into her companions&#39; eyes, seeing the 
restlessness in them all. They were going to have to go out anyway, so 
they might as well do it now. &quot;All right,&quot; Utena nodded, &quot;but we&#39;ll go 
out in groups, and cautiously.

        &quot;How are we doing for funds?&quot; Anthy asked Utena curiously.

        &quot;I deposited the money Ayeka Kisaragi paid us into a savings 
account,&quot; Utena smiled, &quot;we still have several hundred left.&quot;

        Juri slid up from the couch, offering Shiori her hand to pull 
her to her feet. &quot;I also have funds I can contribute,&quot; Juri nodded to 
Utena.

        &quot;Can&#39;t have someone thinking that we&#39;re just freeloaders,&quot; 
Ruka smirked, getting a fierce look from Juri in reply. It didn&#39;t 
bother him, of course, he just grinned.

        &quot;All right,&quot; Utena nodded, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll...&quot;

        The phone rang, interrupting her.

        Wakaba bounced to her feet, &quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; She picked up the 
cordless and asked, &quot;Hello?&quot; She listened for a moment, then looked 
over at Anthy, &quot;It&#39;s for you.&quot;

        Anthy walked over to take the phone from her, frowning 
slightly. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked. An odd look appeared on her face, &quot;It&#39;s 
been a long time.&quot; A pause, &quot;You&#39;re in Tokyo?&quot; Another pause, &quot;Of 
course, I&#39;d be honored.&quot; Anthy set the phone back in the cradle, then 
stood there silently.

        &quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena took a step towards her, &quot;is something wrong?&quot;

        Anthy turned to give her a sunny smile, &quot;Of course not, Utena. 
It seems that an old friend of mine is in town, and would like to meet 
with me.&quot;

        &quot;Do you want me to come along?&quot; Utena asked as Anthy prepared 
to go.

        &quot;No, you need to be here, in case Mrs. Ohtori comes,&quot; Anthy 
shook her head firmly. Another sunny smile, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Utena called as Anthy headed out the door, 
feeling just a bit surprised when Anthy didn&#39;t even respond.

        Shutting the door firmly behind her, Anthy&#39;s expression became 
grave. With a speed that only a vampire could match she went to the 
stairs and practically flew down them, quickly reaching the ground 
floor. She stepped outside, taking a deep breath of the night air even 
as she thought, &#39;It can&#39;t be a coincidence, they&#39;re being here now.&#39;

        Up in the suite Utena took a few steps towards the door 
muttering, &quot;I should follow her, make sure she&#39;s all right.&quot;

        Juri took hold of her arm firmly, &quot;You know that she can take 
care of herself.&quot; She smiled wryly, thinking of their run-ins back at 
Ohtori, &quot;And besides, we have our own problems to deal with.&quot; Juri 
nodded to where Shiori and Wakaba were putting their heads together, 
talking about what they were going to buy on this shopping trip.

        Utena sweatdropped.

        Out in the city Anthy made her way to one of the classier 
hotels, pausing outside to catch her breath. Well, metaphorically 
speaking, anyway. Braced, she walked inside, scanning the lobby 
cautiously before making her way into the bar nearby.

        The bar was the sort you&#39;d expect to find in a business man&#39;s 
hotel, with small tables scattered about for private lunches and 
business dinners. They were spaced far enough apart that it would be 
difficult to overhear, and the lighting was a bit dim. Attractive 
young women served food and drinks, moving from table to table 
gracefully.

        They were sitting at the corner table as promised, and Anthy 
assessed them with her eyes. The gray haired young woman dressed 
formally, the dark colored suit hugging her form, a silver cross 
gleaming on her tie. Beside her a blonde haired, more petite woman 
sat. She was dressed more casually, but her whole stance screamed that 
she was military or bodyguard.

        &quot;Hello Anthy, it&#39;s been a long time,&quot; the silver haired woman 
said, the light reflecting off of her glasses.

        &quot;Integra,&quot; Anthy nodded respectfully to Integra Hellsing.
