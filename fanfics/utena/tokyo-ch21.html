<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 21 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>        The airport was deserted at this time of night, the private jet 
waiting and ready to go. Most of their friends were gathered and Anthy 
was making her farewells nearby. Integra nodded slightly to Utena, &quot;It&#39;s 
been... interesting, meeting you.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Utena sighed. The pale, pink haired woman hesitated a 
moment, making sure that Anthy was out of earshot before saying, &quot;Take 
care of her, please.&quot;

        Integra hesitated, her gray hair blowing back from her face then 
she nodded slightly. &quot;You have my word,&quot; she said crisply, turning to 
walk to the plane, the blonde vampire Victoria Ceres joining her a 
moment later to wait by the boarding ladder.

        &quot;We may not like each other,&quot; Juri said to Anthy, her orange 
hair flowing around her face, &quot;but I&#39;m going to miss our scraps.&quot;

        Anthy was startled enough by that to laugh. &quot;Take care of 
Utena,&quot; the dusky vampire murmured, &quot;she&#39;s far too trusting for her own 
good.&quot;

        &quot;Will do,&quot; Juri half saluted then moved back to give them some 
space.

        &quot;I&quot;m sorry,&quot; Utena said, uncomfortably putting her hands in the 
pockets of her black schoolboy&#39;s uniform, &quot;I wish I had handled things 
better.&quot;

        Anthy reached out to stroke Utena&#39;s cheek, &quot;I wish you had 
asked, you know. I rather think things would be very different right 
now.&quot;

        &quot;So you&#39;re joining the Holy Order?&quot; Utena asked, nodding towards 
Integra and Victoria as the hand dropped away from her cheek.

        &quot;It&#39;s familiar to me,&quot; Anthy said, &quot;and I care for Integra a 
great deal.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t been chasing my brother all 
those months ago, I might never have left her.&quot;

        &quot;Whatever happens,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;try to be happy.&quot;

        Anthy took a step back, smiling slightly. &quot;I will be, I think,&quot; 
and with that she walked to the plane, reaching out to take Integra and 
Victoria&#39;s hands.

        &quot;Are you going to be all right?&quot; Juri asked her curiously, 
watching as the slim plane taxied to it&#39;s runway. It sped up along the 
pavement, smoothly rising up into the sky. It soared up higher and 
higher before it began to shrink off into the distance.

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Utena sighed, &quot;eventually.&quot;

        &quot;Utena-sama!&quot; Wakaba hit Utena with a flying hug, sending the 
slim vampire staggering about, both of them clearly enjoying the game.

        Ruka chuckled softly, the blue haired young man standing by 
Juri&#39;s side. &quot;So,&quot; he looked over at Juri, &quot;what do we do now?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s the question, isn&#39;t it,&quot; Juri said, taking a look at 
Utena.

        Utena walked over towards them and had an oddly distracted look 
on her face. &quot;We&#39;d better get moving,&quot; she said, &quot;Ms. Ohtori is leaving 
town.&quot;

        &quot;How do you know...&quot; Ruka started, then nodded, &quot;the bond with 
Shiori.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d like to check their apartment out,&quot; Utena looked over at 
the girls and sighed, &quot;right after we drop them off at the apartment.&quot;

        &quot;But Utena...&quot; the whining was loud but she ignored it stoiclly.

        Sunrise was growing close as Juri focused her willpower, making 
the landlord open up the apartment door. &quot;Here you go,&quot; he murmured, 
walking off in a cloud.

        &quot;I still don&#39;t like that,&quot; Utena said, leading the way inside.

        Juri chuckled softly. &quot;For a vampire,&quot; she remarked, &quot;you have a 
bit too much concience.&quot; They moved into the opulantly decorated suite, 
looking around curiously. It was lovely, well taken care of, but still 
had the feel of an abandoned home.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t this interesting,&quot; Utena murmured as they entered the 
bedroom. A letter lay on the neatly made bed with her name on it, the 
scents on it a mix of Ohtori and Shiori.

        &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to pick it up?&quot; Juri asked curiously.

        &quot;Do I have to?&quot; Utena sighed. &quot;I&#39;t&#39;s probably a vow to hunt me 
till the ends of the Earth or something,&quot; she complained.

        &quot;If you don&#39;t open it,&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was dangerous, &quot;I will.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Utena popped the wax seal, unfolding it as two pieces 
of plastic fell out. &quot;Bank cards,&quot; Utena blinked, holding them in her 
hands.

        &quot;In your and my names,&quot; Juri murmured, &quot;read the damn letter!&quot;

        &quot;Your are not what I expected,&quot; Utena read from the letter, 
&quot;none of your are. Vampires hunt alone unless ruled by a master, 
vampires are solitary by their nature. Yet they stand beside you unbound 
by power as do humans free of any compulsion other than love.&quot;

        &quot;I do not forgive you for my daughter Kanae,&quot; Utena continued to 
read, &quot;but as Shiori has reminded me I do owe you my life in return. We 
will meet again when I am ready, and until then I want you alive, 
waiting for me. These cards can access but a small part of my resources, 
but they should be sufficient for you.&quot;

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Juri murmured as Utena folded up the letter.

        Utena closed her eyes, reaching out to try and feel for Shiori 
through the blood bond between them but she received nothing. &quot;They let 
us see this place,&quot; she opened her blue eyes, &quot;Ohtori wants us to have 
this, all right.&quot;

        &quot;The sun will be rising soon,&quot; Juri said, &quot;do we keep them or 
leave the cards?&quot;

        &quot;We take them,&quot; Utena slipped the card into her pocket even as 
they left the apartment. They went down the access ways into the utility 
tunnels burried beneath the city, navigating through the darkness 
together.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Juri asked as they walked together, 
their peternatural vision piercing through the shadows.

        &quot;I want to talk it over with the others,&quot; Utena said firmly, 
&quot;once we get back.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like you have some ideas,&quot; Juri noted.

        &quot;Yes and no,&quot; Utena said softly, a slight smile on her face. She 
tilted her head to the side, &quot;Though if those cards are real it&#39;ll open 
up a lot of options.&quot;

        &quot;Call Ayaka Kisaragi,&quot; Juri smiled wryly, &quot;if anyone can find 
that out it&#39;s her.&quot;

        Utena chuckled softly, &quot;It sounds like a plan.&quot; She recognized a 
power box and nodded thoughtfully, &quot;I think we&#39;re here.&quot;

        They climbed up a ladder into a electrical room, emerging 
beneath the apartment building they had been staying in. Utena led the 
way to the elevator and up to their suite, the nervously waiting girl&#39;s 
looking visibly relieved at their safe return.

        &quot;Did you find anything useful at Ms. Ohtori&#39;s?&quot; was Ami&#39;s first 
question as they entered, the blue haired young woman walking over to 
look at Utena worriedly. She voice dropped slightly, &quot;Mistress, are you 
hungry?&quot;

        Utena forced back a yawn, feeling the effects of the dawn 
working on her. &quot;I&#39;m all right for now,&quot; she reassured her, &quot;I had some 
blood last night at the Locket.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;d better rest,&quot; Juri fought back her own weariness and gave 
Ruka a smile. &quot;Call up Ayaka for us, too,&quot; she said, &quot;I think Utena&#39;s 
going to want to talk to us all tonight.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re right about that,&quot; Utena agreed, she and Juri stumbling 
off to their darkened bed chamber to sleep.

        &quot;The cards are real,&quot; Ayaka dropped the two bank cards on the 
table, &quot;not to memtion tied to some impressively large accounts.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled.

        Utena looked around the room, at Juri, the small band of girl 
groupies, Ayaka, Wakaba and Ruka sitting in the various chairs. &quot;I 
wanted to lay out our options,&quot; Utena smiled slightly, &quot;before we make 
any major decisions.&quot;

        &quot;First,&quot; Utena said calmly, &quot;we can go back to Ohtori. The 
girls, Ruka and Wakaba can continue their education there, and it&#39;s a 
safe place for vampires.&quot;

        &quot;Just being safe,&quot; Juri murmured, &quot;has never really appealed to 
me.&quot; The others all pretty much chimed in their agreement to that.

        &quot;Second,&quot; Utena said, &quot;we can go to Britain together. Apparently 
Integra thinks we&#39;re rough but have some potential and before she left 
she extended an offer to join the Holy Order for us.&quot;

        Ruka frowned, &quot;I hate sea trips. Besides, that sort of deal is 
probably one way, I bet. We join, we can&#39;t easily resign later.&quot;

        &quot;Anthy did it,&quot; Wakaba pointed out.

        &quot;And had to phone in regularly,&quot; Juri said coldly, &quot;or Integra 
Hellsing came looking for her to find out what was going on.&quot;

        &quot;The third option is the most risky,&quot; Utena said. &quot;We stay in 
Tokyo, keep hunting vampires either from here or some other base of 
operations. Now that I&#39;ve killed Saya and fought Ohtori to a draw other 
vamps are going to come for me,&quot; she said, &quot;either to neutralize me as a 
threat or just to make a name for themselves.&quot;

        &quot;If you do stick around Tokyo,&quot; Ayaka smiled slightly, &quot;the 
Phantom Quest Corp. can throw some work your way.&quot; She grinned, &quot;Pretty 
much the reason you wanted me to stick around?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Utena smiled back.

        &quot;I doubt the vampire problem in this city is under control,&quot; 
Hitomi noted, the brown haired girl adding eagerly, &quot;it&#39;s something we 
could all help with.&quot;

        Wakaba, Excel, Ruka and Keiko all chimed in their agreement. Ami 
pushed up her glasses and added cheerfully, &quot;And Tokyo has some fine 
cram schools for us, too.&quot; There was a soft chorus of groans at that but 
Ami just grinned.

        &quot;I&#39;d say we&#39;re agreed,&quot; Juri gave Utena a smile, reaching out to 
take her hand, &quot;looks like we&#39;re staying here in Tokyo.&quot;

        &quot;They won&#39;t know what hit them,&quot; Utena agreed, squeezing Juri&#39;s 
hand gently.

The End.

Final Comments and Author&#146;s Notes

        Well, that&#39;s the end for now, at least. I&#39;ve left the ending 
open to be continued if I choose, either continuing with Utena and 
gang&#39;s adventures in Tokyo or covering Anthy&#39;s becoming part of the 
Hellsing organization. I don&#39;t know for certain that I&#39;ll do that, but 
keep your eyes open. As well I&#39;m putting this up in a revised form on 
adultfanfiction.net with additional chapters and more explicit content 
under the title Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded.

        Below are the thoughts and concepts I startred out with when I 
began this series. I didn&#39;t always manage to work all the materials into 
the story but some of it was used. Anything I didn&#39;t use may turn up in 
my revised version, but we&#39;ll just have to see.

        In this story vampirism brings out the dark side of the person 
who has been transformed, bringing up whatever he or she may be trying 
to repress. Touga was a good man originally, struggling with a dark side 
that was just too much for him as a vampire. For Juri, her dark side was 
her conflicted sexuality, so when she became a vampire that side of her 
was totally released, for good or ill. And in some cases a person&#146;s 
sanity can break under the change, like poor Saionji or Kanae.

        Before Utena appeared, Ohtori academy was nearly the perfect 
hunting ground for any vampire. A remote locale with all the students 
confined to their dorm rooms at night allowed the vampires to ravage at 
will, with only Utena and Anthy to try to stop them. Akio chose it well, 
when he came there... or was sent there.

        The curse of Vampirism in this series is being treated, at least 
mostly, as an disease, not supernatural at all. It has effects that can 
be scientifically traced, alteriing the body and brain in certain 
specific ways, and changing when circumstances require. The virus 
changes the body, altering it to be stronger, tougher, and more 
resistant to damage. Of course, it also creates specific 
vulnerabilities, including sleeping during the day, sensitivity to the 
sun, and other problems.

        The psionic gifts that Juri, Utena and Anthy are all beginning 
to show are a result of their altered brain chemistry activating 
dormant, unused parts of the human brain. As vampires grow older they 
can develop even greater mental gifts, as Utena and friends will 
eventually discover. And Mrs. Ohtori already knows...

        Of course, I&#146;ll also be introducing other, very different kinds 
of vampires from Utena and Anthy. Vampire Princess Miyu being a good 
example! I plan to raise the question of the existance of supernatural 
vampires, something that will cause Utena to ask certain questions about 
her own existance.

        I decided to take Utena, Anthy and their friends out of Ohtori 
because I was worried the series was slowly becoming the &#145;Which Ohtori 
character will be the vampire of the week?&#146; story. Setting the series 
outside of the academy will hopefully allow a broad variety of new 
characters to be introduced, as well as exploring Utena and Anthy&#146;s 
situation.

        So why did I decide to mix up the Utena cast and the vampire 
curse in the first place? Of course, I&#146;m not the first writer to do so, 
but I found that the highly erotic edge in much of the Utena material 
really lent itself to a darker, more vampire oriented perspective. Akio, 
Touga, Juri and the others are such flawed heroes to start with that I 
thought making them vampires would bring all those various flaws up to 
the surface. And for Utena herself...

        A woman of deep moral convictions, Utena is tormented by the 
urges and desires that have come along with her vampirism. Not to 
mention the other desires that she may have been suppressing, like an 
deep attraction to other women. She fights to live as morally as she can 
manage within the limits of her curse, and she occasionally finds 
herself slipping a bit. Her desire for Wakaba, her nearly attacking 
Kozue, and her liaison with Juri are all moments which she was unable to 
fight her deeper urges and desires.

        Anthy is quite a different character than in the Utena TV 
series. A woman with a mission, she long sought to eliminate her vampire 
brother, to protect the world from his foul taint. She even went to 
Britain and trained under the Hellsing organization. Now, she finds 
herself reluctantly working with a vampire to stop the creations of her 
brother. And in the back of her mind, she wonders if she will have to 
slay her new ally as well. But now that she has become a vampire 
herself, she is discovering the Utena&#146;s self control is something that 
she may not share...

        Juri, unlike Utena, has totally embraced her vampirism and the 
powers it grants. Wise enough to know that killing her victims would 
likely lead to her own end, she only draws enough blood to satisfy her 
hunger, and to grant pleasure. She longs for a equal, someone to share 
her existance, and thought she found one in the transformed Shiori, but 
Mrs. Ohtori has taken her away.

        Mrs. Ohtori is a mystery, and I plan to keep her that way for 
awhile... What we know so far: she&#146;s an elder vampire, and more powerful 
than both Juri and Shiori. She created Akio, as well as having changed 
her daughter, Kanae.

        About the Tokyo Interlude, I&#146;ve thought about featuring the 
fight between Utena and Akio for a while, but I didn&#146;t see anywhere to 
fit it in smoothly. I hope this flashback sequece isn&#146;t too jarring, but 
I wanted to get into Mrs. Ohtori&#146;s head a bit, as well as explain why 
she might be a bit worried about facing Utena...

        The &#145;prince of the school&#146; line Akio spouts is inspired by the 
Utena movie. &#147;It doesn&#146;t matter if you are a man or woman, one of 
strength and nobility is always a prince!&#148; is another quote taken from 
the first volume of the Utena manga. I was looking for a place to slip 
it in one of my stories, and this seemed to work quite well.

        The Tokyo chapters will feature characters outside of the Utena 
series, as well as continuing the vampiric changes in Utena and Anthy. 
Phantom Quest Coorporation, Vampire Princess Miyu, Hellsing and other 
series will be featured soon.

        Because I am usually a more comic writer, I&#146;ve incorperated 
certain elements of humor to give a bit of lightness to the story. 
Wakaba is a major source of comic relief, and is the closest to being 
purely normal in this story. The Girl Groupies I saddled Utena with will 
be as much a source of trouble for her as a help.

        About the Girl Groupies: I&#146;m still in the process of naming them 
all. Keiko is from the Utena series, Hitomi is from Escaflowne, Ami 
Mizuno from Sailor Moon and Excel from Excel Saga. That leaves two other 
Groupies to name, and I&#146;ll happily take any suggestions.

        The Research Materials! Well, all right, I didn&#146;t actually do a 
lot of &#145;research&#146; on this series but there are more than a few authors 
who gave me ideas and inspiration for this fic.

        First, like any writer of modern vampire stories, I owe a large 
debt of thanks to the writings of Anne Rice. Her first three vampire 
novels Interview with a Vampire, the Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the 
Damned returned the erotic edge to vampire fiction, something that it 
had long lacked. The tortured Louis and the decadent Lestat were some of 
my favorite characters and in part were the inspiration for how I 
handled Utena and Juri.

        I was also inspired by reading the &#147;Blood&#148; series of novels by 
Canadian author Tanya Huff, who added a humorous take to Anne Rice&#146;s 
concepts. A night-blind private investigator and the vampiric bastard 
son of Henry the Eighth investigate a series of supernatural threats in 
and around the Canadian city of Toronto.

        Robert Frezza&#146;s book McLendon&#146;s Syndrome is one of the better 
&#145;scientific&#146; vampire novels, with a unique plotline. Some of my ideas of 
the vampire disease came from this good book. A science fiction vampire 
romantic comedy, I mean, what&#146;s not to like? Not to mention all the 
puns...

        Some of the erotic vampire stories by Pat Califia were also 
quite... eye opening. Not for the faint of heart, this transgendered 
author features both gay and lesbian vampires, in explicity erotic 
stories. Not something I would normally attempt, but quite skillfully 
handled none the less.

        I should also give a tip of the hat to Roxanna Ohtori, an 
excellent author of darkly erotic Utena fanfics. I&#146;m pretty certain some 
of the tone of this fic comes from my reading her works. I&#39;m sorry to 
report that she&#39;s no longer writing fanfics. Milady, you are missed.</pre>
