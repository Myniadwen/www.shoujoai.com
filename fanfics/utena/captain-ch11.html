<a href="../utena/captain-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Juri carefully opened the letter Ruka had hidden for her to find, all 
the while considering what Shiori had just said to her. &#39;Necromantic,&#39; 
she frowned, &#39;death magic. Who would dare use such a thing, it&#39;s 
always been forbidden under penalty of torture leading to death.&#39; She 
quickly read some of the message, and if she had been pale before, she 
was almost white now.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Shiori asked Juri worriedly.

Juri refolded the letter and tucked it carefully away in her coat 
before saying, &quot;I think we need to go see Utena, right now.&quot;

They literally ran from the guest wing over to the suite Utena shared 
with the princess, passing a quite disgruntled looking Saionji as they 
did. They skidded to a stop, and Shiori gently tapped the closed door. 
&quot;Hello?&quot; she called out.

There was a moment of pure silence. Juri gently pushed Shiori aside 
and hammered the door, &quot;Utena, are you in there?&quot;

Another pause, then they heard muffled cursing.

&quot;Did you just hear somebody say, Not again?&quot; Shiori asked Juri, who 
shrugged.

The door was pulled open, and both stepped back from the glare Utena 
gave them. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked dangerously. It looked like she had 
hastily pulled her shirt on, and the way she was shielding herself 
with the door, it seemed she wasn&#39;t wearing anything else.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Juri said, &quot;but it&#39;s urgent.&quot;

Utena didn&#39;t answer, just slammed the door shut. Muffled conversation, 
and the sounds of hurried dressing reached through the door. &quot;Did we 
just interrupt?&quot; Shiori chuckled.

Juri smiled, &quot;Looks like it.&quot;

Anthy opened the door to let them in, and she looked quite rumpled, as 
if she had just pulled on her dress. &quot;Come in,&quot; she said, blushing 
faintly.

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; a smiling Shiori said to her quietly, and Anthy 
blushed harder, if that was at all possible.

Utena came into the room, tucking her shirt into her pants. She 
noticed the smiling gazes that Shiori and Juri gaze her, and blushed 
too. &quot;What was so urgent, then?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I received a letter from Ruka,&quot; Juri started, then she paused, &quot;but I 
think Shiori should tell you what she discovered first.&quot;

Shiori gave Juri an odd look. &quot;When we searched Ruka&#39;s rooms, we found 
what we think is the money he was paid with to duel Utena. I examined 
it mystically, and discovered strong traces of necromantic energies,&quot; 
she explained.

Anthy looked clearly confused, so Utena quietly explained, &quot;Necromancy 
is magic involving death and the dead. Most kingdoms, including this 
one, forbid it&#39;s use.&quot;

&quot;Where we found the money, he had also hidden this,&quot; Juri said, 
drawing the letter from her coat. &quot;Some of it is personal, between him 
and I,&quot; she said, &quot;but what he said about the conspiracy concerns me 
now.&quot;

&quot;I first met Akio Ohtori,&quot; Juri read, &quot;not long after I had left the 
Guards. He hired me on as his bodyguard, believing that he needed 
protection from his father, and I remained with him for over a year. I 
came to know him fairly well during that time, and came to realize 
that he was utterly without conscience or scruples. I left his service 
when he resolved to go to the tainted lands to seek out a dark 
magician. We parted, and I expected never to see him alive again.

You can just imagine my surprise, when a few years later I encountered 
him here, in this very castle. I had decided to seek you out...&quot; Juri 
trailed off, then said, &quot;It gets somewhat personal, again.&quot; She 
skipped ahead a bit and resumed, &quot;The news of his exile had already 
reached my ears, yet Akio was able to move about the castle with 
astonishing ease. He compelled me to return to his service with 
information about my dueling activities, evidence that would destroy 
what was left of my reputation if it was revealed.

I fought the Duels that he commanded, but I grew increasingly 
perplexed by his strange abilities. He seemed to be able to enter any 
room in the castle at will, and the powers of him and his sorceress 
lover, Kanae...&quot;

Anthy gasped softly, while Shiori&#39;s hands clenched into fists. &quot;She 
was the one who set that trap?&quot; Shiori exclaimed.

Juri frowned, then continued &quot;... were far greater than they could 
have been with so little training. I hired several discrete 
investigators, and eventually received a most perplexing report. It 
said that Akio Ohtori had died in a mountain pass, that indeed, he was 
buried up there. I went there myself, finally, and confirmed it with 
my own eyes.

I know not what the being who claims to be Akio is, or what sort of 
bargain Kanae struck to be reunited with him. I do know that the 
blackest of magic is involved, and hope that you and your companions 
will watch over your very souls.&quot;

The room was silent as Juri finished reading. Utena placed her hand on 
her sword hilt, a grim expression on her face. Anthy looked visibly 
frightened by the news, and unconsciously moved closer to where Utena 
stood.

&quot;How do we fight a ghost?&quot; Anthy finally voiced the question that was 
now on the mind of everyone there.

&quot;We exorcise him,&quot; Shiori said softly, &quot;drive his spirit from this 
physical realm. The question is, how do we do that?&quot;

&quot;Kanae is certainly involved, along with Saionji and Touga,&quot; Utena 
noted. A smile teased her lips as she addressed Anthy, &quot;Those meetings 
we called today might just come in handy.&quot;

&quot;What meetings?&quot; Juri inquired.

&quot;Anthy and I spoke with Kanae this morning, and planned to see Saionji 
before we both got a bit... distracted,&quot; Utena blushed a bit. &quot;They&#39;ve 
got to be a bit off balance, and Akio might need to rally his troops,&quot; 
she smiled.

&quot;And to do that, he has to bring them together!&quot; Juri grinned. &quot;I&#39;ll 
have some of my more discrete guards follow Kanae and Saionji,&quot; she 
said eagerly.

&quot;Kanae and friends probably know most of the guards,&quot; Shiori pointed 
out.

&quot;What about Wakaba and the serving girls?&quot; Anthy suggested. &quot;I trust 
most of them, and I doubt that Saionji or Kanae would stoop to 
noticing them,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Very nice,&quot; Utena grinned.

&quot;Then you should also agree to my being there when you all confront 
Akio,&quot; Anthy said to Utena serenely.

&quot;What?&quot; Utena exclaimed.

&quot;Before the argument starts,&quot; Shiori jumped in quietly, &quot;we&#39;re 
probably going to be facing more than just Akio and a few of his 
fellows. I need to prepare to battle Kanae, so excuse me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be coming along as well,&quot; Juri said, stopping Shiori from 
leaving. &quot;I know which guards we can trust,&quot; she said to Utena and 
Anthy, &quot;and I&#39;ll get them together.&quot;

Utena nodded, &quot;Understood. Be ready to go as soon as possible, 
though.&quot; Both Juri and Shiori left the room quietly, leaving her alone 
with Anthy.

&quot;We need to talk to Wakaba first,&quot; Anthy said as Utena prepared 
herself to argue. Utena frowned, but quickly fetched Anthy&#39;s maid, who 
listened to them eagerly.

Wakaba smiled a quite nasty smile. &quot;The chance to get back at dear 
Saionji?&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;d be happy to. They&#39;ll never even know we&#39;re 
there.&quot; She left with a smile on her face, but her eyes were deadly 
serious.

Anthy locked the door, then turned to face Utena. She smiled slightly, 
&quot;You look handsome, even when you&#39;re about to argue with me.&quot;

A blush flamed Utena&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Don&#39;t try to soften me up,&quot; she said, 
but a smile teased her lips. &quot;It&#39;s madness to have you along when we 
face Akio,&quot; she said seriously.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; Anthy sighed, &quot;not unless you choose to define madness 
as duty. I must be there as Princess and heir, to prove his own claim 
false, or else those that supported him will forever call me a 
coward.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t a game of politics,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;it&#39;s a battle of 
sorcery and the darkest of powers, and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to 
protect you.&quot; Her expression softened, and more quietly, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
if I could bear if something did happen to you.&quot;

&quot;War and battle are merely the extension of politics,&quot; Anthy 
paraphrased one of Utena&#39;s books. &quot;And if Akio is a spirit,&quot; she 
added, &quot;he might be able to reach me anywhere. The safest place may 
simply be by your side, m&#39;love.&quot;

A bit of a blush appeared on Utena&#39;s cheeks with the endearment. She 
stepped forward to gently take Anthy&#39;s shoulders in her hands, &quot;I knew 
letting you at my books would be a bad idea, especially after you 
found the ribald ones.&quot;

Anthy blushed in turn, &quot;You can be a bit of a cad, Tenjou Utena.&quot;

Utena drew her into a gentle embrace, &quot;You don&#39;t know the half of it, 
love.&quot; She chuckled softly, &quot;You remember when we first met, when I 
hung back behind you and Miki?&quot; Anthy looked up at her curiously, and 
Utena continued, &quot;I did it so I could admire you discretely.&quot;

Anthy slapped her on the arm, &quot;Utena!&quot; She smiled wickedly, &quot;I did you 
one better, though.&quot; At Utena&#39;s surprised gaze, &quot;When you walked in on 
me changing, it was intentional.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve admired you from the start,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;and loved you 
for almost as long.&quot; A lost expression on her face as she said, &quot;But 
what do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Loving you was easy,&quot; Anthy smiled, &quot;I fell into it so fast that I 
was lost.&quot; She snuggled close, &quot;There is no reason that a Princess, or 
a Queen, could not have a lady consort. When this is over,&quot; she 
started to say, and Utena silenced her with a gentle finger.

&quot;When this is over, and we&#39;ve faced Akio,&quot; Utena said with a smile, 
&quot;we&#39;ll speak of such things. It&#39;s unlucky, to promise before battle.&quot;

And with that, they settled down to wait. </pre>
